come back, bruv!
One the words the best coach ever
He should come back now
This still hurts😢 he is a true LEDGEND!!! Shankly/Paisley/dalglish and klopp . We will always remember him as a TITAN of the sport. One of the best all time managers imo 🎉🎉🎉🎉
This man is the modern day shankly and I hope Arne will be the modern day Paisley YNWA
I'm back 1 year later after this... We miss you Klopp.. but as you know, our club is walking together. Now, go do somthin stupid, we luv u   OK OK OK ** EDIT!!!.. Liverpool fans would love to see you go Skydiving.. whos with me? smach the thumbs up
he is one of the nicest managers for me, alongside Wenger, Ferguson, and Ancelotti. but he's probably the nicest of the four.
Hope Klopp is happy he pushed the vax so hard 4 years ago, he said 99% of his players were vaxxed and that he would not sign an unvaxxed player, if you think they are telling us the truth about Jota's death, think again, athletes have been dropping from the damage caused by the safe and effective treatment, Christian Ericksen and Aguero spring to mind amongst many others.  They say Jota was going to Santander to get the ferry home, the accident was just after midnight on Thursday, the next ferry to England was on Sunday 6th July. Jota would have had a 3  1/2 day wait for the next ferry.  They are lying to us and hiding something, Jota hardly played for Liverpool because of constant 'injuries' and when he did make it to the field of play lately, he was miles off the pace, they are lying to us, WHY?
Klopp ❤
Finally brought myself to watch this video a year later. I love and miss Klopp so much 🥺❤
Who is here in 2025? Thanks, Jurgen. We owe our league title to you.
If personal energy is the main reason for your resignation, Jürgen, to what extent does this statement indirectly reveal the structural pressures and existential burdens that are not being addressed in the modern football managerial narrative, and does it signal that the success of institutions such as Liverpool FC has been built on human sacrifices that are no longer tolerated by ethical reason ?
We did it kloppo ❤
The 20 is our now Jurgen and you are part of it. YNWA 🔴 once a Red always a Red
Just here to watch this b4 the game vs Tottenham where we win league
YNWA Klopp will be missed
🤣🤣🤣
YNWA
One year has passed😵‍💫
Wow
0:15 is the most saddest thing we Liverpool fans heard in our life😢
A year ago today this man announced him leaving this team, what he's done for us is pure magic and I miss every moment of it, Danke Jurgen.  YNWA ❤
Still miss him though
Who would've thought that one year after this interview we'd be in the position we're in. Top of the league, top of the champions league, still in both cups, and overall just looking incredibly solid. Klopp brought this club back to its former glory, and built the foundation for the successes we'll hopefully enjoy this season and the next seasons to come. We can never thank him enough for what he did for Liverpool.
one year.
This was exactly 1 year ago...  I still miss Jürgen even though we're doing well this season.  Klopp rebuilt this club and Slot is starting to continue his legacy and bring more glory to Liverpool.  Danke Jürgen.  You'll Never Walk Alone ❤❤
It's been exactly a year since this🥺 0:12
Premier league is disgrace   He deserved to win the 19 and 22 season, but they were the bitches of Abu Dhabi and his corruption
Im an Arsenal fans but put it aside, Klopp is the best manager. Father figure and very enthusiastic! He is just a legendary
❤
9:08 Goat.
I had to come back again because he was so right in everything he said. He has brought the team back to where it belongs. A fearsome opponent. Liverpool is absolutely dominant at the moment. Thanks to him, the team he helped to create and his very good successor, who was certainly also chosen by him. Edit: Oh yes, and of course I'll still follow Liverpool from Germany and hope that they do well. And knowing that Jürgen definitely gets a huge boost in his private life and the atmosphere there when Liverpool wins makes you even happier.
I still miss this man like I would a relative that’s passed
We changed ...we believe
Danke Jurgen
💔
Thank you . Amazing Person .🎉
Thanks for all, God bless you and family coach 🙏🙏❤️❤️

Jurgen Klopp a real legend  😘❤️👍💪🤗👏🙏🥰😍🤩 God bless 🙏him. I love Liverpool team, because of him

If we had won nothing in his time it would not have mattered because of what he did for our club.
He left because of the corrupt officials in the premier league, giving Man City the league. Well done oil money 💴 we just lost one of the greatest managers in history.  Man United fan here.
It was about 11mm here or 15mm there. That's life. We had so many good things. If you want to remember them, remember them. I will, forever.
The owners because he his on is way back to management with Dortmund .
YNWA! Arsenal Bad! 115 Bad!
Grande Klopp
He his quite amazing man and here what shine through his the honesty of the him wishing to see life for himself apart from foortball has he is ageing why not we all need to retire at some point and he puts the team first for a advance notice with a year to find a new manager,
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I am not a football guy at all, but even I know: This man is a legendary figure in the sport, with a beyond-impressive track record and an all-time unshaken, dead honest demeanor.   Finally admitting you're losing the spark after performing so well for so long must be a big punch to everyone's ego, and I think a lot of people could learn from that.
If he agreed to coach the US National team I’d give him a billion dollars and my wife.  Ok I’m kidding, I don’t have a billion dollars
PLEASE COME TO THE USMNT 🇺🇸 we will give you anything you want! Half of Texas a room at the white house anything bro

I just watched the video of his arrival at Liverpool, the first press conference right after he took the job.     I can tell he puts on ages in this 9 years.      It shows the severity of the job.     To me, he is the kind of guy who would encourage others with a smile when he is in the middle of a hardship himself.      Jurgen, you have done way more than enough for the club, the fans, the players, and the city.     It is time to take a break, relax, and enjoy a slow life.
He should be the Germanies Manager for 2026
Forever in our hearts gaffer
pray the best for him in the future. may he will be a lagend for any clubs.
One of the greatest manager 🔥
Thank you Sir Jurgen Kloop for giving us wonderful football recitals and for your sweet personality, a sincere, classy and exemplary football man♥️♥️♥️🙏
Klopp Statue need to be rect in Anfield stadium, this man transform your fucking club and made you what you're today
Sincerely speaking nobody can manage Liverpool as this man has done mark my words I'm an Arsenal fans klopp is a complete manager, if I'm Liverpool fans Salah leave our club too he is giving this man a big ego problems Salah is rude and as no respect for this man
I am short of words to describe this incredible man. For me, the best coach in my 62 years of my existence. Jurgen may God prosper your remaining careers for giving me joy throughout your stay.
And now he’s gone……..
I’m a Madrid fan but we will forever miss you legend.❤ Much love from North Carolina
Y. N. W. A KLOPPO❤❤❤

As a Real Madrid fan i Wish him All the best , wishing him a good health and good luck in the future. Greetings from Kosovo/ United States of Albania.
Toller Mensch mit Charakter. Hoffentlich mal bei meinem FCB!
He's so true though, Liverpool is truly special. I started watching football in 2019 and from that first year I have supported Liverpool till now. Klopp didn't just create an amazing team, he created a family of millions of people. All the Best from India. YNWA ❤❤❤
Jurgen Klopp builds and destroys Liverpool, love him or hate him, you decide.
😢😢 jurgen klopp best manager
Arsenal fan here, always had the biggest respect for this guy and Liverpool the last years. Big love and hope it's either you or us winning this year <3
เพราะทีมขี้โม้มากผมก็เลยอาย ขอล่าออก555😂😂😂
my girlfriend and i broke up today. And im here feeling the pain of losing both these people
Stay away from Salah Jurgen, do not be the reason for his lack of success
I ain't liverpool fan, because of fans and stuff as I faced racism at the stadium in the past. But, I love this man even from when he used to manage back in Germany. I hope he could rest well and get back to football..!
I honestly hope, that he'll take over germany national team, someday..
Mir fehlen grad die Worte 🤍
You hv done a very good job,and I respect your decision I'm on your side good decision though big up to you🎉❤good luck.
This killed me this did
From a chelsea fan it's been a pleasure to have you in the Premier league wishing you good health an a prosperous life ahead all the best
this is our song about the dream of this city which never works alone in your name  accept love from us who will remain standing loyal here forever for you liverpool fc  be loud and be the best they can't compete with you this story will remain written without anyone like you  the ball is chased by the ball press and hold press wow press they did fight look at our heroes  you come show that we have to keep moving forward sick, sick, prove it victory is in sight
This is the bestest manager My team has gotten in at least about 40 years. He will forever be cherished, deserves every bit of my love for football. YNWA🔴
He shouldn't have revealed this. Should have waited end of the season.
The greatest ever, will be missed. YNWA❤
Rats leave before the ship goes down
HE will in 1 of the best manager WE had in the history of the club.
Klopp 😍
Good but hes no god at Liverpool Football Club ,yes he's lost more than won (in title, champions league, micky mouse n fa cup) but fk it he's a German so your not surprised.
we love you klopp
He admirado a Klopp desde que lo conozco, aunque no voy al Liverpool, pero este entrenador merece respeto y admiración, es un caballero.
Everybody in Germany knows which team he will manage next... The white jerseys with eagle on top.
Wola lapho mkloppzana
Good riddance
슬퍼 😢😢
I can’t watch this past the 4 minute mark. The greatest Liverpool manager I’ll ever see
thank you coach
At first when I heard the news, I was obviously gutted. I was in tears, scared of what the future would bring for this football club. But I've come to realize that I am actually somewhat excited for the new era, with a new manager and a fresh squad. No one will probably ever come close to what Klopp has done for this club, but it's time for new opportunities, new stories, new victories and losses. Thank you for all these wonderful years Jürgen, and you'll never walk alone! - Sincerely, a loyal red from Estonia. ❤
Next German national team
..........."it's only because I want to join Chelsea "  !  and I say : Welcome Jurgen !
He will go down in history as the man that transformed a midtable down and out team into a winning breed once again. He won the lot in just a few years and if he would of had just that little bit more help,support and funds theres no dowt he would of won more, i think the mans tired of having to challenge city without the funds and support  from the board. He has won the whole collection in just a few years a true legend so thank you jurgen klopp a legend the "NORMAL" one ❤
Amina Ahmed onerepublic starts counting
Plz don’t leave you have been the best manager I’ve ever seen plz don’t leave klopp
This must be the most charismatic manager in recent history
Why 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

We'll all miss you Kloppo.  From the Liverpool fans, rival fans, the media, the people of Liverpool, football fans to the Premier League.   Enjoy your rest, live your best quality of life and you're always welcome to come back to Liverpool Football Club. This is Home.
The Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo of the touchline. Jürgen Klopp
Better to go out on a high and celebrate the achievements rather than fade gradually staying too long.
Jurgen Klopp To Coach  International Team!!!!!
I was crying when he said he was leaving u have gave Liverpool everything ❤❤😢😢😢
Er macht komplett ..das richtige......Klopp  hört auf seine innere Stimme .........und macht das absolut RICHTIGE ......sollten alle Menschen tun ✌✌✌❤❤❤   super Typ.....Weise.....   Entscheidung .....  erhole dich und mach nie wieder Fußball ......mach etwas für andere Menschen...etwas soziales mit viel Freizeit   ...Good Luck
I'll miss you forever, Jürgen Klopp
What is incredible about living in Liverpool is that everybody knows where Klopp hangs out and walks his dogs but everybody leaves him the fffk alone because he means too much to them
Good bye Zeke Yeager ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Such a great coach
Livershit!!!!! If you can't afford it steal it
Got to be the most overated manager of all time.
Thank you 위르겐 클롭
He sounds and looks like someone with LONG COVID. The cloudy hazey brain. He needs an extensive check by a COVID medical expert.

Like i mentioned when he arrived at kfc Klopp the Flop. Guardiola, Ferguson are superior

Komm zum hsv😂😂😂😂❤

Jurgen klopp will always be Liverpool ..
Gracias por todo, Jürgen.
I think He is leaving now because of last season where they didn’t do too well . And now mane had left Salah is Aging probably won’t stay long . He know soon Liverpool Will struggle again . He wants to leave in good term didn’t want to leave by getting sacked or struggle . I guess that’s the reason
Premier league will never be the same 😢 wishing you well in your future Klopp what a legend and great human being 🎉
Have this feeling he’s unwell medically, he smokes a lot. Goodbye master klopp.
There is no one like you, Jürgen Klopp Boss💯
Imagine losing the Primer league tittle by 1 point 2 seasons... and losing to Cheaters with 111 chargers.. You cannot win against cheaters either you join them or relegate them.
YNWA❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Czy myślał Pan kiedyś o prowadzeniu np drużyny narodowej .Polski?
Greatest coach ever we will never forget you wish you all the best
One message good bye klopp
I am a Spurs fan and you Liverpool FC stole a champions but i have respect and i hope Jürgen Klopp wins the europa
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Liverpool will have to build a statue of him in front of the stadium after this season ends
As a city fan I am crying cause he meant so much to Liverpool I will miss him rivalries will boring with out him😭😭😭
😢
Go to bayern
If he's running out of energy why don't he go to bed and sleep 😭😭😭
I didn't watch this interview when it came out because I was too disappointed about the news. Now that I finally came around to watching it, what a man! Such character and respect for the club and the fans. You can tell that beyond football, he is a decent person. A true leader. Much respect!
Great Lad. Let him go with dignity. He wants to
Klopp has been the best manager in liverpool for the last 30 years his leaving is like a death in the family but i think the toughest job in the world must be a manager in a top 6 club in PM he has achieved everything with the club most important winning the PM after 30 years i have a hard time imagine anyone who can replace that man you cant help but like him he's the best he put the club back on top but staying there is hard on any manager especially in liverpool good luck jurgen you gave everything i love liverpool even though im not a supporter
Danke für all die schönen momente mit dir, wenn ich verzweifelt bin hast du mit dem team wieder hoffen lassen und meinen tag gerettet. Danke für alles was du für mich und für alle anderen getann hast Danke jürgen du legende❤
we are liverpool, we went through hard times together. sobz
🇮🇳
Time for Stevie G. Stevie is Liverpool, Liverpool is Stevie.
🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️😭😭😭
Growing up i wished Liverpool could win atleast one premier league and i was always made fun of for supporting this club,  then this man came in. Thank you Klopp for making my dream come true. All the best in life, you are a true legend.
Danke Jürgen!!
thank you klopp for building liverpool i love you klopp
Klopp you said you are healthy so why are you doing that best manager in the world
And that’s what happens when u play with Darwin
If I’d known when I was a teenager that the only person to absolutely shatter my heart into thousands of pieces would be a German man with fantastic teeth; then I would have been more risky in the dating market!  You’re the man Kloppo. The absolute man.
Love this guy....let's pump it for this stretch! Let's go LIVERPOOL!!
Please stay Klopp U need to overtake Alex Ferguson's trophy room
Jurgen Klopp will be remembered as one of the best managers to ever grace the premier league, and also one of the most popular managers ever.
Still breaks my heart that he is leaving 😢 Hope he changes his decisions
Dear LFC-Fans, thats how we felt 9 years ago... 😭😭😭 I know it's hard and that Jürgen Klopp is not replaceable at all. So give him what he deserves ❤💛 Love from Dortmund!!
Fully accapted. Sir, you are a lagend.
You will always be the best ever manager at Liverpool Great man kop respect 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Though sad ,its a wise decision and a part of his heart will always be for Liverpool and may the next manager have the same ethos ,passion and care for the players and fans .
Im gonna cry fr 😭💔
4 weeks later, I've had the emotional energy to listen to this.
18:06
On of best coach in the world but do not catching braca 😅 hala madrid
Love you Jurgen !!! All the very best in your future. For sure  I am very much depressed by watching this video. But we all respect you and want you to be happy !!! YNWA !!!!
수고많았어😢
Jurgen Kop.
RIP in the chat
*Klopp has NEVER been sacked in his 3 jobs. That's the problem: no break as a top coach in 23 years, except for 3 months after his Dortmund job.* ANYONE would be extremely exhausted after 23 years at this level of commitment!
😢
The job can be stressful. At the end of the day he needs to put his family and mental health first. At the end of the day, he’s already contributed tremendously to the club
Siap2 aja jadi kayak EMYU 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We all know he wants to join Dundee United. Andy Robertson probably filled his head with glorious tales of European nights at Tannadice.  Take a year off Sir, we await you with open arms! 😀
Thank you so much coach. You gave me so many happy memories and helped me believe in something that brought me such joy and for that I love you my friend and you will never walk alone . God bless and I will watch you til the very last day .
😞🙏🏻❤️
I don’t think any fan or any team can appreciate the lengths Klopp transformed an 8th table team with a 15 mill budget or less (with Kolo toure at cb) and then compete with more than a 50 million invested squad with a league record of more than 100 points and lose title by 1 point. No manager can replace Klopp.
Im a utd fan but i am upset that jurgen is leaving. He was an icon to the game❤. WHY AM I TEARING UP!?😂
GUTTED. followed Liverpool for over 50 years never felt so disappointed.  However being roughly the same age I can say I fully understand Jurgen's decision and I respect it. Do your thing 👌
You will always be apart of the Liverpool family! We were so lucky being on this journey with you and blessed with your love of Liverpool. All of Liverpool wish you the Best Jürgen and your family, from the bottom  of my heart bless you and thank you.
by klopp we will miss you
God bless you brother loop and family!! YNWA!! Wherever you are or go loop family you have a home in Liverpool sir kloop!!
We're going to miss you Klopp! 😢
...but he did better although don't wntb Coaches know how to take feedbacks BUT as early seasons were actually the ultimatum   That's it
He needs a break he's human
We love you Jurgen!  Thank you for everything.  You have brought us a lot of joy and i cannot tell you how much i appreciate.  You deserve your walk off into the sunset.  We love you Jurgen!
I am running out of energy🗣️
bring Rafa back!!
Weil in England der Kartoffelsalat nicht so gut schmeckt wie in Deutschlandistan!!!! 🤨
Respect man ! Tons of respect . Hats off
3 Weeks and I’m still crying...😢
You'll never walk alone!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Finding it hard to stomach this decision, it's sad knowing you are leaving LFC we love you and pray you change your mind before the season end.YNWA
ความคาดหวังอันสูงสุด ความกดดันสูงสุด พักก่อนครับ
Ngoja tukuchape Sunday ndo utoke😂😂😂
IF we win the title this year I will be an emotional mess watching Jürgen. He's level with my mum and dad 😂
I don’t think he is leaving. He said this to push Liverpool to “win one more for him”. That’s the only way they can beat the mighty City, play mind games. If they win the PL he will be back
No matter where klopp goes he will allways be a Liverpool legend
okay the real reason guys --the almight god himself touched klopp and he gonna walk till the corner of the earth until he puts him rest
Good bye to jurgen klopp of Liverpool FC
2024 Mbappe to RM Xabi to LFC  2025 JK to RM
correct decision .... otherways time will oxidite team and manager
For me Klopp is everything; many if not all in the squad consider him a father, majority of us fans consider him a role model and father as well.. He came in as a guest and now he's leaving as family😥  For me this great man is everything and it's impossible not to love him and it's your humility for me💯. You'll absolutely be missed at length, thank you for getting us back on track as a club.. Always my legend, hero and motivator❤YNWA.
cya Jürgen, Schon dieses Video und diese Art der Veröffentlichung macht dich zu einem außergewöhnlichen Trainer. Kann nur hoffen, du findest heraus, was für ein außergewöhnlicher Mensch du bist. Aber nicht abheben! Klar? :D
Late but seriously. This amazing man and everyone under his management got the Scousers almost one of every trophy we have ever heard of. YNWA
FC Schalke 04 needs you!
Really sorry all Liverpool fans and players I support Chelsea but like Liverpool because my dad and brother sorry about it
I’m so sad ❤️😢
German-scouscer; I’ve seen it all….. I pray for him to see his happiness in life for his sake & not listen to negatives from outside.
Wi love you Klopp. Fotboll is gone 😭❤️🤍🫶
You will always be one of us
❤️⚽️🏟️  you will never be forgotten
This news is so heart breaking, couldnt stop my tears rolling down.. this person has given me soo much joy and pride since i have been a liverpool supporter from my school days and i have followed him since the time he has been in BVB and changed their history and i still remember when he was announced as the LFC Manager "The Normal One" i could not believe my luck that he was actually our BOSS and over these number of years we have gone on crazy roller coaster ride which have been memorable.. there not goes a time whenever i pray and ask god to help him and LFC make this season a memorable one where we can send him off on a high with our club to be the first to achieve this feet of a quadruple and he has a statue made in front of Anfield and the KOP is renamed after him to the KLOPP, this is the best we as supporters can do for him keeping in mind that he has done soo much for this club from where he has picked us up from being "doubter to believers". Gaffer thank you soo much for all that you have done for us and you will be always remembered forever as a legend in this club.. You will always be RED.. RESPECT ❤🙏🏻🤲🏻🤝🧔🏻 One of your Die Hard Fan from KSA
I’m going to miss you the most Kloppo😭
As a rival fan of Liverpool, I am so glad he's leaving.  But as a rival of Liverpool and a  football fan we will miss him and his personality! He'll go down as one of the  top 5 epl managers in the last 3 decades.
I'm a Gooner and even I love and respect Klopp. A true gent
If he had just kept a lid on his online gambling things could have been different
Now Liverpool FC really need to win the league for Klopp.
As a UTD fan, I think Jurgen Klopp is the best Liverpool's manager of all time much love from Thailand.
It's easy to leave on a low, but being able to look in the mirror and have this honnesty with yourself to realize your time has come takes a special kind of strength . You may deny it but we all know you were the real "special one" all along. Thank you Jurgen, we all wish you the absolute best <3
what a great Man Klopp is, 25 minutes to tell the world that he is a mortal , thank you Mr Klopp for all you gave to football
Best football Manager  in the world 😢
Klopp one more please 😢😢😢❤
Thank you boss
genius human beings see the future...bravo klopp
Dignity at its finest.
Thank You Jurgen for your honesty, many would have carried on with no doubt less energy, but you have been totally honest that you need to recharge. Good luck for the future, whatever, wherever, you will give it with full energy an commitment. Taking a break is not a bad thing, that's what Pep did and came back stronger, maybe the German Team will see you back renewed energy, they need you.
Thank you Kloop. You are the best leader. Appreciate you! My hope is to meet you. Have a nice day~
True legend and an honest man. The way he looks at life is so inspiring
We are Liverpool. yeah. This may be the most important word.  I hope jurgen is always happy. I'm afraid of change, but I still want to support the team. Because 'we are Liverpool'.
مدرب عظيم اتمني له التوفيق شكر يورجن كلوب❤❤
I'm a student of football manager ok university, and klopp is my inspiration besides I'm Real Madrid Fan
😢
Thank you Klopp. Thank you for everything. You'll never walk alone.
Hello liverpool im currently playing fc24 and i scored a hat trick against Manchester united thats it
I'm still crying💔
I am a Man Sjeikie fan but this men is a GOAT. The best manager after Pep and Wenger in his prime.🫡
I really love you、KLOPP&your team！！ Please come to Japan to have relaxing time!after this season✨ We have fantastic nature!!
Does it mean he retired?
Not being a Liverpool fan, I still regard him as a most respectable and dedicated manager, being true to himself, to his club, and to the supporters.
❤❤Thank you Somuch Thank You  very Much  You  Never  Walk  Alone❤❤
Klop Milan Is waiting for y!!!
Love from Türkiye🇹🇷 Even though im not a liverpool fan, this broke me. You deserve anything you decide,YNWA
YNWA. Thank you for everything.
Als BVB Fan bin ich schon sehr enttäuscht von Klopp. Er sagt um eine unvergessliche Legende zu werden, dass er nie wieder einen anderen englischen Verein trainieren würde. Im Interview mit Sebastian Hellmann bei Sky nach den BVB aus zögerte er keine Sekunde nach der Frage: "können Sie sich vorstellen, irgendwann einmal die Bayern zu trainieren?" und antwortete: "Ja klar! Ich bin Fußballtrainer, wie könnte ich mir da ein quasi Berufsverbot für Bayern München ausstellen?". Das ist jetzt endgültig die Zeit, in der man mit der Klopp Ära abschließen und sie nicht mehr romantisieren sollte, von wegen wir suchen den neuen Klopp. Ich bin mir sehr sicher, dass zumindest ein Edin Terzic niemals einen anderen Bundesligisten trainieren würde als unseren BVB!
I will make a very similar speech with my company soon. Jürgen inspired me again even when saying farewell ❤
Klopp the best coach
I’m not a Liverpool supporter, but what manger…and what man. Definitely one of the best out there, one that is capable of building a team and not just inherit it. Stoked he made the Premier League his home for so many years.
Well  respected  and honourable man ,thank you so much for being there for us Liverpool
I know where I was when I heard the news.
Come to Fenerbahce
Estoy llorando😔👍🏻
Always a Gentleman! Loyalty 100% ❤
Jurgen, we love you
I'm an Arsenal fan, but i love him🤗 ,I have sooooooo much respect for this man🫡 ,he can do no wrong in my eyes ,enjoy your life 🙌🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I've grown up watching Liverpool with him... Thank you boss ♥
Will miss this man will all my heart do no envy the man to fill this man’s shoes
Echte Liebe <3
Thank you very much for everything, Jurgen! You’ll be missed by all of us LFC fans. YNWA ❤ xx
Why 😢
Top class
SIR  ALEX   FERGUSON  LEFT  OR   QUIT   MANCHESTER   UNITED   AS  A   SUCCESSFUL   MANAGER,   NOT  AS  A  FAILURE  OR  SCAPEGOAT   MANAGER.   JURGEN   KLOPP   MADE   THE   RIGHT  DECISION   TO  LEAVE   LFC  AS  A  SUCCESSFUL  MANAGER   AT  HIS  PEAK  OF  CAREER.   🇨🇾🇨🇾👍👍
I  AM   A  MANCHESTER  UNITED  FAN,   BUT  I  HAVE  TO  ADMIT  THAT   JURGEN  KLOPP'S  PRESENCE  ON  LFC   WAS  SUCCESSFUL.   MY  OPINION   IS  MANAGERS  JUST  LIKE   JURGEN  KLOPP   MUST  LEAVE  OR  IF  YOU  PREFER   QUIT  AS  A  SUCCESSFUL   AND  NOT  AS  A  FAILURE  OR  SCAPEGOAT   MANAGER,   JUST  LIKE  SIR   ALEX   FERGUSON   BACK  IN  2013.  🇨🇾🇨🇾👍👍
Am arsenal fun but i love him to mach we miss u sir i wish u all z best the rest of ur life
Bye bye Klopp🥲
The respect all Liverpool fans have for this man is outmatched. I think he may be the most respected coach in history
Come take over Sweden's national team afterwards! I promise it's not too much work, you even get the euros and world cup off!
Wir lieben dich, Jürgen, du bist der Beste! ❤❤❤👍
Very sad to hear that he's leaving. This man is a hero and a genius and he will be greatly missed. Good luck with your future endeavours Jurgen we love you and you will never be forgotten ❤❤👍
Love you jürgen, we all did you achieved everything you could with this team we will forever love you go Liverpool
Chapeau ,Mr.Klopp.Such a nice person,honest and intelligent .Always a pleasure to see and hear you .Hoppe everything will be alright for you and your family .😢
Well this sucks
Enjoy your "rest" coach.
Rest up, so deserved.   Hope in the future you manage Germany 🇩🇪 !!!
EZ
Hi there from Manchester United supporter from Ukraine! Its very sad, however....I remember how bad I wanted Jurgen to join our club when he managed Dortmund.... Great and supertelented opponent, great persona! Good luck in the future, mr Klopp!
This is too sad to watch
You will be missed.we love you klopp. may almighty be with you always
I’m not being rude but I’m kind of happy but he was better pep guardiola I mean he won everything
it's not suitable time for talking about this decision within mid season
This the greatest human being, ever  Swallow every word of humbleness, yet strength
He's leaving because Liverpool are scouse scum.  Simple as that!
He looks knackered. Excellent servant to the league. God bless. Leave with sheer adulation and respect.
Thats so sad after everything he done for Liverpool From a united and madrid fan  More Aris fc fan  Liverpool in my 2nd favourite club in england
Job
Jürgen, du bist echt der größte Trainer aller Zeiten! So klar im Kopf und so zielgerichtet wie ich keinen anderen kenne, Du machst es genau Richtig: zur richtigen Zeit klar und deutlich deine Entscheidung bekannt zu geben und nicht dieses endlose Getue um den Brei herum.   Nimm Dir deine Auszeit für deine Familie und vor allem für Dich! You'll never work alone!! ❣
I can only see him with a comeback at Dortmund someday, or - more likely - a national Team. Probably Germany.
The only one man that I don't want him to leave the club. After Firmino, this is the most heart-broken moment I don't want to see. Wish you all the best Boss! Thank you for everything you did for this family.
Legend
This Klopp is a good guy .
He is running out. He dedicated his self. He loved Liverpool and football. Congratulations. This is absolutely retirement. He achieved it. That is happy for me, you and us. Bye! Enjoy the rest of your life.
Hopefully, after his well-deserved break, he can coach another club (or even Liverpool again). Football NEEDS this man!
ขอบคุณบอสที่บอกให้ทุกคนได้เตรียมตัวดีกว่าที่ทุกไม่ได้เตรียมตัวถ้าบอสออกไปเลยทุกคนไม่ทันตั้งตัว
โชคดีน่ะ 😊😊😊😊
All good things come to an end unfortunally... How ever this is the only way this man would ever be able to leave the club! :D Big thanks for giving us happiness in life Klopp!
Where with you klopp
wenn interessieren dreckige Diskriminierer
Clever guy, knows when to leave, especially that corrupt league where even crystal clear VAR pictures are ignored. He’ll probably take over the presently migrant team which is currently a joke, especially with that teenager coach. Time to clean house in Germany.
that's it, the disaster is about to start, without Klopp Liverpool is nothing 😢
Love you Jurgen. The club had been changed for the better, forever
Because liverpool wont increase his salary 😂
im not a Liverpool fan but you gotta love this man down to earth, a good dude with a phenomenal managerial mind.  football is gonna miss you Klopp. the prem is gonna miss ya
We love you Klopp. Absolute class and an absolute legend. You will never walk alone. This one hurts but we have to go and win all the trophies for him. You have to respect his decision.
Siempre agradecido de que nos hayas elegido cuando no encontrabamos el rumbo y otros clubes sin la grandeza de nuestro club ganaba cosas importantes, pero llegaste y no lo podia creer, nos devolviste la grandeza que nunca perdimos y nos devolviste esa mistica perdida durante muchos años sin rumbo. Simplemente gracias Jurgen ❤ decirte que te amamos es poco. YNWA ❤
The best manager the club and football has ever seen! Thank you for all!
This won't be a good bye forever as Jurgen can return after a year or two after taking rest
😢😢
After watching this again now and fully digested it all for over a week. It’s clear now what he’s saying. Basically this is in a polite way saying I’m bored with this job now, it doesn’t excite me. He wants a different setting and different job. It won’t be a year of sabbatical it will be a few months and probably the German national job. I understand it hurts so much but maybe it’s just too much to deal with (owners, pressure of the need to satisfy our fan base) and living in Liverpool for that long he needs a change. We all feel like this.
Thankyou Kloppp big boss❤️
What an honest interview.   The perspective that he wants to experience life outside football after 24 years of managing is so refreshing...  All we need to say as fan is thankyou Klopp and lets wait till last home game, to celebrate together one last time.
Jürgen has done a lot for football, and a lot for the United Kingdom. He's given British football fans a breath of fresh air. His wife is his rock, and they deserve to go and live their lives and be happy together. Germany should be really proud.
Hi I don’t follow soccer at al but I watched this guy  talking and I thought  what a very genuine straight talking  down  the line guy  am sure Liverpool will miss  him. Best wishes to you and your and your second family Liverpool from Dave in Ireland 🇮🇪 God bless👏👏👏👏👏
What  a good  manager of all time we Liverpool fans well  miss you king of manager   Ilove you ❤❤❤
내 인생 최고의 감독
Thank you for your service and your time, you don’t owe anyone an explanation anymore than your time is up thank you wish you the best
I'm still never ever trust what Klopp said, he lie to leave our Club 😢
Top bloke, top manager. Big respect.
I'm from Colombia and I first saw this man as a Dormund coach many years ago an I knew there was something special about him. Now having Diaz at Liverpool he became a weekend fixture for me. I will always remember that first hug after Diaz scored his first goal. That defined what this man means to the players. After this interview all I can say is: What a Classy, Proper and Respectful man. A true CLASS ACT. Chapeau Mr. Klopp. You will be missed.
Dude, I'm an arsenal fan. And when arsenal had me hating on football for their lack of passion for the club in recent times. I started watching Jurgens liverpool, and they really brought back that love I had for football. No lies. Still want liverpool to lose at the emirates on sunday😅
I can understand the man, cause some jobs can easily and will burn a person out. Mentality,physically ,emotionally,motivation or maybe your heads is just not in it, not only will hurt that person but the team will suffer as well or you just need a break. You’ve got to give the man credit for coming out and speaking to the fans and club .Imagine the pressure these top teams and their managers are under to perform week in week out. And it doesn’t matter how much you make,in fact the more you make the bigger the pressure that comes with it. Maybe it’s a see you later, you never know what going through a persons mind , at times you might not be motivated or what ever. Believe it or not that could cause health problems. On behalf of a Real Madrid supporter I wish him the best.
Go to real madrid
wish him all the best, this man does something, that actually nearly only he can do it. lfc is so grateful to have him for so long
fraud
Just win another season with Reds and thanks for all 😢
so he's burnt out?
Great man.
Xabi Alonzo
so much love for this man!
You will never walk alone.... Kloppo.
One comment hit me in the gut, and I am of the same mind. I am not a Liverpool fan, but I am a Klopp supporter. I was a huge  fan from day one when he took over Liverpool.  I love his energy, the animation on the side line. The way he drives any team he coaches with his love for the game and players. You can tell Klopp's passion for the game where some coaches hide their emotion he wears his for everyone to see. 😢  Sad day for Liverpool
You and this club under your stewardship have brought me so much joy. I am so grateful for having this wonderful human being as our manager. Thank you Jurgen. All class!
Why This time 😭😭 what'll happen if you leave? You really made me cry
So, why is he leaving?
Tldr; he doesn't have the energy to do another season with the plans coming up, and he wants to look around more of life
I really hope the club get the right man for the job , because whoever takes the reigns as got some squad, the right man and Liverpool could dominate for years
The last game
Man really does deserve a Hoilday and retirement with his Family maybe a drink or 2 haha  God Bless Klopp Y.N.W.A❤
He said it years ago that he would give up his coaching career early. He said he only sees one stadium, travel, training base and this is repeated over and over. You must know that he loves and cares for his family very much, I understand that. Any extreme does not lead to good, then you will regret not spending time with your loved ones. I'm sorry, but he said it and it blew my mind, when I heard he was leaving the club, it wasn't a shock to me.
GREAT COACH
don't leave 😢 please no, i know you're running out of energy, you made Liverpool shine 😋
Clear of sir alex fergusen
The coach for the people, the "normal one".
Thank you Klopp!
I respect to him again <3
That will be a big coaches caroussel next summer . Real, Barcelona, Liverpool ....
Noooooo määäääään😢
Chelsea supporter here. This is such a beautiful story you got here. Respect.
The guy is honest in every aspect of his life... he knows he needs to have some more time for himself and his family.... there's nothing else but REPEAT the same again at liverpool, or maybe even football, and that isn't living.. its maintaining... wise guy to spot that point of life.
It's so cool to get an inside interview like this available on Youtube. As a kid, I would watch managers come and leave clubs, but never got insider information because it was on TV. There wasn't access like this. For as long as I've been a fan of Liverpool, Klopp is probably the best manager we've had. We finally got a PL trophy and have mad many other great successes. He brought an intensity and will to win that made the games electrifying to watch. I can only imagine what it would have felt like being at Anfield on some of those night. We appreciate everything you have done Klopp! Blessings on your future.
Dortmund felt the same way
LEGEND.
This man has done so many great things for my favorite team that it takes my breath away. maybe I'm from Poland. Maybe I'm not English. but I know Liverpool YNWA. Thank you thank you. you are the best of the best
This guy is a real crack!!!
I AM NOT CRYING!!! YOU ARE CRYING !!!
😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔
YNWA Boss ❤❤❤
What Klopp did is commendable. It takes a person who is in control of their thoughts and emotions to make such a tough decision decision.  All the best with your future endeavors Sir❤
Jesus christ... one of the sadest videos I've ever seen. This man has given 110% for over 20 years. He is burned out. He has done so much for football, and I will always love him for everything he has done for BVB and for football. Kloppo for live. I hope he finds the path that makes him happy.
Barcelona next 😊
What a brilliant way to end the interview. Very respectful individual!  I sincerely this decision will give him his 'normal' life and regain his energy back. Sounds slightly silly, but definitely shows 'mental health' plays a part... Fantastic man!
Next trainer german sélection
It's a long way... but I think Kloppi has arrived. All the best to you and maybe you will remain in some way for us fans and the club ❤
Kloppo ist einfach ein geiler Typ, dadurch das er sich nicht so wichtig nimmt, ist er umso wichtiger. Macht ihm einen gebührenden Abschied liebe Liverpool Fans. Schöne Grüße von einem Borussen.
Does anyone be able to relate when he said: I don’t know how (normal) life is?!
Will miss your charisma , your charm , your sense of hunour and that big smile , you have given our club some the best football we've ever seen , your dedication and hard work is second to none , you fitted in like a glove at liverpool , liverpool love you , the city of liverpool love you , liverpool will always be a part of you as you will always be a part of liverpool,  please come back and see us klopp , you'll be so sorely  missed  Liverpool legend and we hope we can repay you by building a statue at anfield in your honor ❤  God bless you klopp and thavk you so much for everything our honary scouser For what you've done for our great club   YNWA ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ Good look jurgen to you and all your beautiful family  Enjoy your time out xxx
As a United supporter i absolutely hate the fact that I can't dislike that man. So humble and honest. It's been a privilege to have a rival like you
Mark my words Jurgen Klopp is gonna be come the new head-coach of the German Mannschaft.
Thanks klopp you're Liverpool godfather football fans will never forget your legendary moments in anfield best of luck in the rest of your life ❤
I can't imagine Liverpool without Jurge Klop
Judge I respect you and appreciate and the best person i admire you are the best about person 💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩🎩
Incredibly senseful 😪 liverpool fans are the luckiest supporters of entire world because having the special Jurgen Kloop
It's crazy that Klopp has had a managerial career spanning 24 years 😅😲
I love this man ❤❤much love from Zimbabwe ❤
He is Liverpool.  Its mean more From korea.😢😢😢😢
Raglife™️ 🤝 ⚽ 🇬🇧 🇩🇪
We'll all miss you 🙌⚽ El maestro 🎩
A normal German Guy came to Liverpool to touch the hearts of Anfield and revive the Dreams of YNWA. LEGEND <3, Danke Jürgen Klopp für so wundervolle Jahre in Liverpool mit Herzblut und Comebackgeschichten
Huge respect for this man who made so much for Liverpool . Your decision is probably the best gift he can do to him and he's family , go live a normal life Klopp , and thank you for everything ❤ much love from France (sorry for my english i dont know it well for now)
COME TO BRAZIL PLEASE
legend
If I were footballer in any parallel universe, I'd wished to be in a any team just to be with Jürgen Klopp or Temur Koberidze(former coach from Georgia, Khashuri.. Sadly, he passed away). Love this guy. (I'm fan of AC Milan, Maldini, Pirlo, Seedorf, Nesta and others.. Timeline)
😭😭😭
Thank you Klopp❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Nah, you can come back any time big guy 😤😤🥹🥹😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ghe😂zu Hoeneß bayern bauern hat genug steuer geld  .jeder weiß das er ghet zu bauern😂😂😂😂
Go help CHE....
Sounds like approaching burn out
The greats always say goodbye on their peak.
Fair play Juurgen Klopp. I 100% get this decision. Many people won't, Liverpool fans may be frustrated and not understand and people may have cynical views. You only get 1 life and no one knows when their clock expires. You've done your work and want to enjoy your life and your burnt out and don't want to live the life your in any more. Well done for what you've done at Liverpool and throughout your career.
Huge respect and lots of love from South Korea❤ thank you Jurgen YNWA
I don't know how this feels but it's sad to know the man who has had so much influence on your life even from a distance as continents apart having to leave the club you love so dearly. Great personality no doubt, super intelligent and a great football manager. Klopp represents everything legendary and I always will remember him for that. As a liverpool fan who never experienced football success until Klopp's era, I'm only grateful to be part of the Klopp-liverpool time. Farewell and have a wonderful normal life,Gaffer.
"nobody will sack me" is one of the coldest lines i ever heard in football :D But its true. Mainz and Dortmund would have kept him if he didn't leave on his own
so impressive
Clearly is not happy with clubs decisions. As Barça, I am still sending you luv and what you have done for the club and love for futball. Broken heart here. Love you and will always. Stay healthy and enjoy ❤ retirement..
This guy the one of the best manager football ever see in hole life together with pep.. Thankful for dedication and all doing.... Appreciate that gentlemen 👏👏👏👏
Very intelligent man. Life is short. Way too short to do just 1 thing over and over your entire life. You’ve won it all. Leaving when you are on top is so intelligent. Go and enjoy the small things.
Никуда он не уйдет. Хотят выиграть АПЛ, просто игрой не могут, надо создать суету)
A legend that made legends live a legendary life. You will always be remembered. Thanks Jurgen!!
Jürgen Klopp for Bundespräsident!
good luck for you Boss.. wish You all the best.. im glad that juergen is a red
😢💔
As a football and Ronaldo fan, I wish him happy and more successful career in the future.
Keys to Liverpool, keys to millions of hearts, turned those hearts to gold instead of stone =  HERO, LEGEND, SAINT… maybe not but maybe😂
Liverpool should have a *Jurgen Klopp Street*
I hope they win the title. The man deserves nothing less to end his run.
Mu
Pronto a sostituirlo.
Thank you Jurgen, Unforgettable memories, GOAT! YNWA
YNWA boss ♥️
It's shame that Klopp will be leaving the reds in the summer. It was one of the best managers that Liverpool had in the history of the club. Liverpool had 4 managers who made history for the club: Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Rafa Benitez and Jurgen Klopp. Farewell Jurgen, I wish all the health and strainght that you will need and I hope, someday, you will came back to Liverpool. All the best for you.
There are a few manger's that have filled me with the love of football Jurgen Klopp is one of such nature if he choose another club I would follow the football there
Great coach. Great person.   Henk de Jong from SC Cambuur has to hurry to meet you at Liverpool
My respect for this man comes from his time at Dortmound. A character of world football
We all want to make the best of best this season
thank you, Jürgen. sincerely! may we all take yet another note from your playbook and know our own limits, know when the time has come to stop and allow the new leadership to come through. thank you thank you.
You are very inspiring person. I am so sad for such decision. Hope you enjoy your life as much you make us love the team. All Respect from USA❤
How did I get here, couldn’t care less about Football.
Do you know how EPIC it would be if he said "I know I could never manage for another team in england than liverpool" and then signed with Man United? BAHAHAHAH
My utmost respect to a great man not a liverpool fan but he's a fantastic manager you will be missed.
congrats Bruh
He left cuz Liverpool won't win a single trophy
KLOPPO♥ YNWA
Dankeschön, Jurgen!
Best man in football. Not even a football supporter but always had time for Klopp.
Er hat sich halt kein Meter verändert von seiner Menschlichkeit ❤️❤️❤️ und ich find es auch so nice das ein Video in YouTube... (Interview) mal mit ehrlichen Emotionen und ganz ohne das Ego füttern zu müssen, kommentiert wird.( und das Verein, Nationalität unabhängig).   Diesen Mensch,kann man doch einfach nur mögen 😊  💓💓💓
Kloppo is just the most honest "normal guy" on Earth. Read between the lines…
Thank you very much Klopp ji, you are a legend and a true person, you made the Liverpool  and football world Happy, and makes it different. Who ever people believes to be the greatest football manager in the world, I believe today you make them to realise that you set a benchmark of a football club manager be like. I want to call you Sir klopp you deserve it. You reinvent football for the KOP. Thank you endlessly.
"I'll be back!"
Ich bin einfach nur ein Deutscher der Fußball dank seinem Vater ab und an mal schaut und ich fand auch schon beim BvB das er einer der besten Trainer ist den Deutschland hat bis er in Rente geht. Das er so geliebt wird von den Fans von Liverpool hat er sich mehr als nur verdient 👌🏼❤️
Head coach of a national team could be the right place for him at this stage in his life (after the needed break of course).   National coach is a more relaxed part time job compared to the daily stress of club coaching.  And I don't see Germany doing well at this years euro cup... Might be a position open there soon... 😉
I know life goes on but I hope if I can dissuade Klob from leaving Liverpool , any way you are one of Liverpool legends Best wishes MR Klob❤❤❤
What a heck of a human, ha? I am glad I lived in the tiny sliver of earth days to see this force of love, compassion and dedication on show. Thank you Jurgen!
Im sorry that your leaving but ill accept it. Youve given everything to make both my and your club as good as possible. Gaffa forever. One thing though. Even when youve left your life will never be normal again. Always will be my gaffa @lfc and Jurgen the scouser Klopp.  "Im so glad that Jurgen is a red"  See you sunday boss 🫡
Every morning I go on my phone, hoping he has changed his mind I will not give up till the season is over :( cannot get over it, this has hit me :(( I LOVE THIS GUY YNWA!
Give that man a statue. A f***ing massive one. One of the greatest managers in the history of the club.
He's one of a manager you can't hate as a football fan , what a guy 👏🏻
Keep up the good work Josh 👏
Brilliant guy!!
I‘m a German and here Klopp is some kind of national hero
He deserves some rest for sure, he did so much to this club. Thank you Jurgen.
Top top bloke, fair play to all that was said ❤
so why did he quit?
شي يبكي 😢  اجمل فترات حياتي والسنوات الي مرت وغيرتنا فيها وكل شي جميل مر علي كان عهد ليفربول مع كلوب جزء منهم يا اجمل ايام العمر واجمل فترات عمري وكرة القدم ❤️❤️
Blows my mind how talented, smart and honest this man has always been. Love you Klopp. What a legend
Im not crying im not crying stop cutting onions 🧅 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 YNWA forever Jurgen
A role model of a man. Learn your boys to look to Klopp. Everyone has something to learn from his behavior and mind.
OK see you in Madrid next season
What a great guy
You never walk alone!
I've got over the shock now, but I'm still gutted. I think all of us want the best for Jurgen, and if he feels this way, then we all owe it to this man to wish him the best and thank him for giving us so so much of himself to us all. I'm upset! But, if this is what has to happen then it is what it is. Thank you, Jurgen! God bless you, mate! And thank you for the 4-0 against the Barca at Anfield that night! For me, that was better than winning the actual cup! You made miracles happen that night! Love you XXX!
Veni Vidi Vici Danke Jurgen Klopp 🙇🏻🙏🏻 YNWA❤
Klopoo! All the best to you and family! The adventure of a normal life is coming soon 😄 Liverpool will now have my full attention at least until the end of the season. Cheers from the Azores islands
Bye bye
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Kloppo is the ❤ and soul of this football club! We must enjoy and appreciate his precence while he is still doing his magic with LFC! 🙌✊✊ A beautiful story about a perfect match of Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp is sadly coming to it's swan song, but its not over yet so "give it a go" as the BOSS use to say! ⏳👊🏟️🎵🎶 YNWA Kloppo ⚽🔴❤🔥
0:16 the moment of heartbreak for us LFC fans
This man is very wise he knows when to exit the stage 💯 blessings and more life to you Kloppo
The best
Wishing him the best on his journey ahead, and grateful for the incredible memories and success he brought to Liverpool.😍
An honest and honourable man. A rare breed indeed.
Hes not happy with axa sponsorship,
He does not manage the club, he becomes the club...
He Might wanna join Barca who knows xavi is also leaving.
im still not over this news 😭😭😭
Wise man. Your health comes first when it comes to stressful situations.
Mane...that is what happened
Luv❤. ... Jurgen klopp.
Please the lfc authority make jurgen Klopp.. To be with us LFC in humanity ground .. But in business n professional ground.I doesn't have any right to say... But JK❤ is the best
Jk I luv u to be here...
Please don't leave LFC..club....
I love this man, greetings from Turkey, simple the best man alive...
Be just like Sir AF, just retire, all this talk… let’s us down Bro
So looong Mr Klopp. Jose Mourinho is absolutely free at the moment.
If this club wants the same stability as Real then bring on Mourinho! Klopp could never win over real anyway...
Bring on Mourinho and this club will be back to the glory days!
Jürgen is great in and out.
Thank you , you'll certainly be missed.
"Anything good has to come to an end, if you over do it you spoil it" PLO Lumumba
Kloppo, komm heim und trainiere DIE MANNSCHAFT! Wir brauchen dich
Jürgen. Спасибо большое Вам за Ваш труд!
Just when Liverpool was about to become the greatest Football Club in England.  Thank you Klopp for everything you have done for us.
Besides all the competition between managers and the number of titles they won, as a person, Klöpp's the biggest i've ever known. I wish the best luck to you Jürgen!
It's hard for me to listen to this clip. It's so hard I can't accept this. 😢
Most people start following teams because of specific players but I became a Liverpool because of this guy right here.  Absolute Legend, Great Individual and a Beast with team tactics! We will truly miss you, Jürgen❤️
United Fan here, happy that he wont manage one of our rivals ;) but extremely sad to see this class leaving PL. Kloppo YNWA huge respect and love !!
Klopp leaving Liverpool is just not a setback to Liverpool fans but to the English premier league. Klopp's style of play and connection with the fans is just another level. I wish him all the best, at the same time I don't agree with him saying I don't have any more energy left in me. It's something internally in the club's structure that must have forced him to come to this decision- coming from a Manchester City fan. Love you JK
The one manager fans of all other clubs will miss too.
9:40 povestea lui klopp de viata Ca nu e posibil dar cu planning si multa munca se poate 12:02 nu-mi place ca trebuie sa fie despre mine, eu nu ma consider asa important (modestie) dar stiu ca pt ceilalți nu e asa (empatie) si de asta fac acest anunt
YNWA
Great manager!!!💓👑💓
At first, I thought it was fake news. It was hard to believe. No, I didn't want to believe it. However, as sad as it is, I think it's time to say goodbye. Klopp, thank you. I will always support you. - Liverpool fan from Korea -
He leave-erpool
im a Manchester United supporter, but i have Big respect for this man. 🤩👏
"I'm not happy with my decision but I know it right"  Hallmarks of great leadership!
I'm an Arsenal fan and even I don't want him to go lol
I know talk with both clubs leverkusen and liverpool are already on at the corner.all has already planned.Ya i will cherish tgese four months with Klopp ,the Boss.
Xabi alonso next for sure.
“I need to have a look at how life is… cause I just don’t know” if you will say anything after this quote he stated in this interview, quit thinking
Today best Trainer in the World
Thanks coach
Beginning of another 29 years?
What he does is integrity
Come to Besiktas 🦅🦅🦅
Jürgen mach was du für richtig hältst. Würde mich freuen wenn du wieder nach hause kommst und die deutsche Mannschaft wieder auf Erfolgskurs bringst nachdem du dich dazu bereit fühlst.
As a Bayern fan, i have always been a fan of Klopp since early Dortmund days. legend at Dortmund and a legend at Liverpool
Massive respect from an Arsenal fan. While he had annoying moments on the touchline, he seems like a pretty decent guy. All the best to him
😢
He wants to make more Money with Advertising. Advertising Wh***.
Thank you Arthur Morgan
habib now come to kerala
his point of wanting to put them back on the right track b4 he thought of himself, say's everything about this legendry manager. big respect
"I`m not happy with it, but i know its just right"...
You have done everything for the club that you set out to do you will always be one of the best managers we have every had up there as one of the greats. If he feels like that i am sure the door will always be open if he ever wants to come back. I hope he keeps ties with the club and it will be a great loss for us.
Hope you have good time with your family Klopp ,dont want to loose you but you deserve everything .Danke Klopp
RIP Liverpool.😮 Klopp done good thongs with standard players over the years tho.
Respect👏
I hate LFC and am a proper Utd fan but I should hate Klopp but i don’t hes a hard man to dislike
Kloppi rulez 🎉 He really improved his English over the time.😅
Jeus! This guy is going before we (arsenal) can make him drink some water!!! I mean beating him thoullery! Like 5,6-0. Arteta   do something before he goes, including taking the epl trophy!
I have a feeling after a year he'll take the German National team job. Still allows him to be around the game but doesn't have to be football 24/7 lots of downtime with a national team job
Im not even a liverpool fan but will trully miss this fella.
This is heartbreaking not just for LFC but for all the football fans around the globe. Love everything about this Manager, best wishes to Klopp. ❤
Jurgen has earned his time to relax in the sun somewhere. He changed the way the world played football.
god bless and well wishes Klopp YNWA
He need to take break atleas for some years because he had given some much to this club an it's not an easy task you risk your health your mental stability His not a machine that we reboot him or turn it off an turn on again ❤ get well sonn
Come to Barcelona sir your service is much much needed here please sir come to Barcelona the way is clear you just have to say yes
Respect 💯.Thank you klopp. Liverpool bring in Steven Gerrard.👍
シーズンを終えて、休暇が終わったら日本代表監督になってください。 Once the season is over and your vacation is over, please become the coach of the Japanese national team.
ไอเลิฟยู🇹🇭
❤ KLOPP ,  YNWA 🙏🏻
Goodbye😂😂😂
bukan pecinta liverpoool hanya penikmat sepakbola.. pak jurgen membawa hawa kompetisi baru di liga inggris bersama pak pep yang menurut saya pesaing beratnya.. dimana sebelumnya liverpool era pak rafa juga menghibur, dan pak jurgen membawa kembali hiburan itu ke rumput hijau yang sudah lama di tunggu di EPL league menurut saya.. saya cuma mau berterima kasih untuk dedikasi tenaga, waktu dan kesehatan yang sudah di letakkan bersama semua crew dan pemain, akhir kata selamat berlibur pak jurgen, enjoy the moment
Love you
A heavy lost both for liverpool and the premier. Nothing but respect for this great person from Colombia.
Massive respect and love to this man! You are always the best manager in my heart.❤ YNWA.
How incredibly lucky we are to have lived at the same time as him and watch him be great. I feel absolutely blessed and grateful. Thank you for everything, Boss Klopp. ❤
😢😢😭😭😭we love you klop❤❤
DankeJK YNWA!
Die Deutsche Nationalmannschaft braucht dich!!!
Dude even strategically planned his exit at the perfect moment. A reminder some things happens only once in life. Wish you all the best Jürgen. Wenger was so unlucky to leave at the worst time possible 😢
thank you so much!
As a United fan it hurts me even more to see Klopp leave  He's the only one that really helped EPL survive Pep Massacre  Modern day great manager  Edit: Finally when I thought Arsenal Liverpool n City will have a horse race  He's leaving which means only Arsenal will challenge City from next season onwards no other teams  Sad to say or see but it's a fact
제라드가 팀을 떠날때 만큼 슬프네요.😢
love you x
ayrılıklar da sevdaya dahil hoca adamsın
I met him in Darmstadt, Germany in 1986... Never forget that day... Very impressive man....
😢 YNWA BOSS BIG LOVE BIG RESPECT from INDONESIA
his done so much for the club but man city income stream is unmatched he can only take a pound so far it must be frustrating battling against a club with new players every season. he is a better coach than pep as his battled with players that cost half as much. give him man city and they would win alot more champions because his a better overall coach. lets face it liverpool have been giving pep a hard time year after year
Thank you Klopp for your honesty, energy what you developed on the field and the hard work at LFC. You're a legend ! Greetings from Canada !
can't they give him 6 months or a year break, can't imagine a Liverpool team without Klopp
Y’all think he will go to Barcelona?
Yo this boss man has just made a real one ☝️ cry 😭 no doubt a legend for England and Liverpool. When he said.- no way I’m going to coach another England team gave me chills 😊and more respect for him

Fascinating and very heartfelt interview. There are very visible changes in his demeanor from the youthful and self-deprecating 'Normal One' to the more hardened version of himself that is often grumpy with journalists and certainly with referees. I think it demonstrates the relentless pressure that Premier League managers are under in a billion-pound business that is so closely scrutinised by media, statisticians, owners and fans alike. Let's hope for a triumphant end to the season, and then we can properly pay tribute to JK for his achievements, and his honesty in his reasons for stepping down.
So Stolz auf dich Jürgen. He never made it about him. Gruss aus München. ❤
Great leader and manager, thank u and well wishes
What a great man
The only team he can coach is real Madrid other than that he will never be as successful like he is now with Liverpool so good luck
I’m Man United fan, but I sad when the people said if a men announced for leave from premier league. Danke Jurgen ❤
Legend❤️❤️
His a smart man. Smart man. Smart man hands 🙌 down liver pool is very grateful to have you as a manger. 🫡 but I’m reading between the lines and his body language but I’m starting to think the team is heading in the direction he thought it wouldn’t not be happening but he took a time of his time to sit back and reflect on what’s happening right now- present and what’s going to happen moving forward. His time unfortunately is up 🆙 his ticket is being punched. Idk 🤷‍♂️ hopefully 🤞 an international team contacts him.
In life, you think about what comes next when you're at the top of a mountain. Do I recognise the time? I have the utmost respect for Jürgen Klopp to say I'm quitting. Very few people manage to make a cut before they regret it. I fully accept his decision and wish him and his family a wonderful life and good luck, all the best and good health. With this in mind, best regards Angin
Put me into tears so bad I can’t take it gaffer please don’t let it happen 😢
👏👏👏
tldr: im bored and the rain is depressing
Greetings from 🖤💛Germany 💛🖤 We know till today, how you feel…but that’s the game, and this Dude Love it 😍 🥰 The normal guy, says normal by🤔 I fu…ing love this Man till death  „…wir stehen Dir bei, bis in den Tod, sing für Dich für 🥰Dich 🖤💛Borussia 💛🖤   P.s.: allet nur nicht niemals Never le no zu den Bauern ….
Know when to stop - 48 law of power 💪🏿👏🏿
The only manager tht cn compete with pep
What an absolute Gent... Le.. Man. Is there any sound more beautiful than the Truth.  I know nothing about football not one thing but I do know about the Truth and about love Light. You are entitled Mr Klopp to figure it out what is this life without all that you have been doing thus far. I wish you all possible light and blessings in your new life you so deserve it all. 🙏💜
Reading all these comments is a real tear jerker 😢
Well done manager, my best manager, I'll Miss you here😢
Such a honest and thoughtful man
he's going to the MLS
A true legend
He's German! Of course he wants to try farming!!! Clarkson tried, so Jürgen want too
I am a Manchester United fan and I heard he's coming to United
As a Liverpool fan from Argentina I can't believe this sad news about Mr klopp he will always be a legend to us Liverpool fans around the World . YNWA  Boss
Hör doch sofort auf mit dem Fußball wo liegt dein Problem? Hast doch schon viel verdient. Warum wartest du noch auf Saison Ende?  Als der Mesut Özil in der Corona Zeit nicht auf sein Gehalt verzichtet hat, habt ihr ihn fertig gemacht. Bei dir ist es auch nicht anders. Jetzt wartest du bis zum Ende. Bist du deine Kohle verdient hast richtig so seid ihr
Just a brilliant interview from a brilliant man
It is very difficult to leave a place where you have worked for a long time and consider it your home. But Jurgen Klopp had some good moments and gave other people a chance.  Danke Jürgen!
For me as a Mainzer, it feels good when he says that he wants to try out normal life while he still can. He's a great person, completely outside of sport.
He instilled the best for the club, making the most out of the least, no major expensive transfers but precision delivery.
Bring in Sami Hyypiä!!! 💪🏼💪🏼⚽️⚽️🇫🇮
I am a Dortmund-Fan and I can image how Liverpool-Fans are feeling right now
One of the best trainer nowadays. A gentleman, he will be missed.
Good luck Jurgen, God Bless! From a Rams Fan
Jürgen Klopp is a legend!
He is a true champion, thank Zhou Kloppo❤
Modern football's modest hero.
Let this serve as a reminder to every organisation: Don't exhaust your most valuable assets.
thank you!
The Legend. And the Man. You will never walk alone, Jürgen.
It’s time to move to Barcelona
What a decent honest man! respect! that's what life should be about, not a club not a job! being true to yourself! valuing what this man is valuing !
Mr Klopp we've got your back because "you would never walk alone"😢❤❤
Thanks 🙏 Klopp good 👍 luck wishing you all the best and good health ❤😊 YNWA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Klopp...😔
Definitely a better manager than anyone we  have had since Alex Ferguson retired. But he won one Premiership in 9yrs so don't get too carried away with how successful a manager he is.
Jurgen,  Thank you for bringing your own brand of football and the gegenpress to England.  I'm not a Liverpool fan, but your team has been very entertaining to watch.  I wish you all the best for the future.  I believe that both you and Pep have improved the standards of English football.
He looks tired.
Damn, that was a really good speach. So honest and direct. You are a special man Jürgen and a brave one too. I hope you find your other purpose and enjoy your time.  It's been well earned.
geh in rente opa
Man Utd fan but this guy is a real OG 🙌🏾
Welcome to Grêmio FBPA 2025 Season.
Jürgen Klopp... The normal one...
We will or miss you take care 💟 ynwa
life goes on, old trafford need a new brilliant & genius manager .. you already familiar with premiere atmosphere, superb Klop and thanks super Liverpool
Always the victims. In the bin
Jurgen Klopp You'll never walk alone, the true Liverpool Fans, we well never forget you, and you are part of us for the eternity. we back you up.
Funny how as a pretty be staunch Man U supporter. I can’t think ill of Jurgen, in fact I find myself full of pride on behalf of our sporting rivals, and full of respect for a brilliant manager. Whatever your future holds, I’m sure the sun will shine on you, because you have blessed us all with what you have done in the Premier League. Good luck Mr Klopp
Thank you for everything that you have brought to the club and I will miss you for and I am crying watching this thank you😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 sike I lied thank this will help arsenal to win the prem next season but seriously wish you well🎉
This man is a legend. Someone tell me how this interview ends cause my heart can't take it.
*Right decision at the right time*
thank you
Super Arbeit Klopp
As a Man utd fan i can say he is one of the best manager in world football he elevated the epl standard..Respect
YNWA Jurgen , bravo maestro , from Uzbekistan with love and pain at the same time🇺🇿❤️
I never thought that one day I'm going to have a life lesson from Klopp. Thanx coach ❤
He should go to Vasco da Gama from Brazil.
24m to say im leaving ...
We will know the Reason after he Leaves. 😢😢
Manchester United fan. I love Klopp. He's a great man who is blessed by God. 'When people’s lives please the LORD, even their enemies are at peace with them.' — Proverbs 16:7
I'm a Manchester United fan and it's hard to admit I like a LFC manager but I do. Klopp is an amazing coach with an amazing personality to match.  Arguably one of the best managers ever. I wish you and your family all the best Jürgen you are a top fella.
❤
I am going to c cry
I think he has made the right  decision & at the right.  Good luck to him .
Usually, when a coach like this leaves, the club goes down. I hope this is not the case with Liverpool. I grew up liking ManUtd because of Sir Alex, and later Chelsea because of Mourinho. Now my favourite club in England is Liverpool because of this guy. I Hope you guys can get a great coach to replace this awesome man!! Good luck to Klopp and to LFC!!
Thank you for everything, Jurgen! Massive respect for this big personality.
next season manchester united will be same level with liverpool. 🗿
I dont know a lot about football but isnt the current liverpool team similar to the 1st time Jose Mourinho was at chelsea? Wouldnt jose be right for this assignment. Jose is not a team builder he needs big club, big players and a solid defence with a lightning counter striking??? I'm just palpating at the thought can he come and do it specially he is the guy who has been a thorn in Guardiola's side in the past and even when he was in charge of man u at premiere league he won against pep often.
Good luck mate .
Klopp am going to miss you. I loved Liverpool because of you and most of the players and their family like relationship. Right now many have left Liverpool and we still have some hope. YNWA🔴
Much respect for you sir 👏🏻💯 From a “Pep fan”
GOAT
Arsenal fans appreciation button👇❤
Unbelievble
😭
I'm not a Liverpool fan but this... this right here... is a great man
17:40 „But I will not manage a club or a COUNTRY at least for a year.“  Get some rest, next stop German National Team! ❤️💭
It's because of MANE leave 😢
Man sollte aufhören, wenn es am schönsten ist.  Kudos to everything you have achieved, Jürgen! ❤️
The man got to do what he got to do. Great hire by Liverpool then. Respect👍
❤️
I'm not crying.  You are crying! 😭 ❤YNWA♥Klopp♥
Thank you The Normal One, for EVERYTHING. The clubs in a great place right now to continue building on. We get this season on together, and then WE GO AGAIN! You've more than earned your 'you time'. YNWA Jurgen. Thank you.
Love me some Jurgen Klopp! Watched him at Dortmund and was extremely impressed.   When it was time for The Professor (Wenger) to leave Arsenal, I was hoping that Klopp would take the job, but the timing wasn't right.  Much Respect to the Brilliance that he's brought to The Beautiful Game! And I say this an an Arsenal fan. Hope his next path brings him Happiness and Inspiration!
When Suarez single handedly put Liverpool in contention for the title, I thought that if not now, then perhaps never again... And when Gerrard slipped... I thought I would have to wait decades to see Liverpool win the Premier League... However,...then,..  came Klopp
Jurgen IS the GOAT football managers! What a simple but at the same time great speech! And how rich in emotions and feelings! So honest and open to the world. He resurrected Liverpool club! It reminds me of Michael Schumacher who has helped resurrect Ferrari after 20 years! These people come only once in a lifetime! His words and his love and loyality to LFC are so special and honest... That man is unique! No single negative word! He is a true leader, a true inspiration to anyone! What can i say to a man like this! A THANK YOU is not enough! Truly from my heart, You Jurgen are a LEGEND!!! So proud to have you in LFC for ever! I truly wish you the best in everything you decide to do moving forward. You will be missed for sure. YNWA!!
9 years of EPL and Liverpool.. Hell of a man!! Love from Arsenal man!! Happy days! wishing you best!
An an Arsenal fan, I approve Klopps message. It is the right decision for him. He deserves a break. lol!
Tragedy!
😔😔
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
He will become the German National team manager in 2025.
Nobody cares about LFC . Bye
There is a book by Annie Duke called "Quit". This is a good example. I love what he is doing, not only for himself but for the sake of the fanbase but also for the fact that; sometimes the best decisions are to quit. As a Chelsea fan, hats off to him for building a culture. I'll always be jealous of that. Bravo!
There is a scene in American Gangster where a character played by Chiang Kai-sheck tells the character played by Denzel Washington "Leaving when you are at the top is not the same as leaving" Jurgen realized, as he described it, that he run out of the tank. He is leaving out of the huge respect he has for the club. Most managers would cling on to the job and perform worse and worse until they are sacked. He understood that he has nothing else to give and respects the club enough to know it deserves better. Huge respect for the guy.
The fact that he prioritized his well being outside of fútbol is commendable. Realizing that there’s so much more outside the world we love as fans is something we must accept. There humans. They have families. He’s tired. Like he said, he wants a normal life & doesn’t want to wait till it’s too late. 🙏 You deserve your break. You’ll be missed.
Happiness always short
Hes Face tells Everything .This Guy is tired and he must Leave.
😢😢😢😢
<3
ahhh this hit me so much
I really appreciate him. Kagawa, Minamino, Endo. They gave A lot of positive effects from you, sir. Thanks for trust and use Japanese potential players.
Ek.....haft dieser Typ
Xabi Alonso is the next in line to be employed, i wish Mr Klopp success in his next move, I'm not a Liverpool fan, but i love the job this man has done for this wonderful club, he deserves so much appreciation from everyone that is associated with the club.
bester mensch , danke kloppo
Klopp we support
I know Exactly what Jurgen is talking about... And the fact he is able to even be aware of this shows how grounded and intelligent he actually is. Much Love Dude! <3
We would be happy to have him as national coach in Germany. I know this won't happen so soon but maybe sometime.
I am a Chelsea fan, but I really like Klopp. He is like a father figure and I am sad that he was not our coach.  I wish him the best. Hope they lose against Chelsea but win every other match hehe. Wish him and his family all the best. Thank you for making the PL a better League.
All the best Klopp in ur next chapter!! from Arsenal fans
"Because you love the club, you love Liverpool, you love everything here, you've decided to leave, even though I understand what you've explained, i know, but I'm saddened."
Im depressed because klopp is leaving 😭😭😢😢😭😭😭
Buy sonny for Jurgen Klopp, Only way
I think his announcement of leaving at the end of season is a gimmick and it’s now boring
he is fucking legend and I'm saying it as barca fan
First two minutes is like: " I am old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts...."
Trainerlegende!
It is really hard to find such an honest and sincere coach like him! I ve always admired his style and coolness...so long Klopp, we will miss you. Good luck for the rest of your life 🧿
He got older visually. Looks 20 years older after joining LFC.
Well done. Great coach
Thank you for everything klop you've done enough for me as a Liverpool supporter sad to see Yu leave but will forever be in our hearts....legendary sttz🙌⚽💯🐐 Yu left us with 💯💯💯
Arguably no.1! As a man utd supporter, Massive loss! 🔥❄️💥
Why does time pass so quickly?
I think he will lead Germany to world cup and win it... I will be happy for him, such a great gentleman.
Huge respect, from Real Madrid fan.
What a great guy - honesty and rarity in some sports - good luck 🫡
ÜREME ORGANI KLOEPATRA
as a Mainz 05 Fan i know how you Liverpool Fans feel right now.  Without Klopp Mainz wouldnt be in the First German league . the whole City was crying when Klopp decided to leave Mainz.   i wish him all the Luck and maybe when he sees how bad Mainz right now plays he want to help again.  " Einmal Mainzer , immer Mainzer"
ドイツ代表の監督だね
YNWA Jurgen <3
We ❤ you Mr. Klopp ! Thank you for the magnificent journey, big love from Indonesia! YNWA
Ynwa...koppo
My favorite coach!
Absolute inspiration. Thank you klopp.
Panie trenerze może jeśli pragnie Pan nowych wyzwań to może reprezantacja Polski?
If 24/25 EPL season starts &  Liverpool isn't anymore managed by Jürgen Klopp plz 🙏 Don't Wake Me Up I'll rather keep dreaming about him still managing Liverpool then facing the reality of loosing him I can't imagine Liverpool F.C without Jürgen Klopp on the side line 😭😭😭
Thank you Kloop for bringing so many successes to the team and all the Glory and all the good and bad days we will never forget u!
Meinen allergrößten Respekt vor diesem Mann, und das sage ich als Schalker! Leute aus Liverpool, was habt ihr für ein Glück ! Ihr habt die Beatles und Jürgen Klopp, mehr geht nicht.
23:00 respect that.
Jurgen, Jesus loves you and we are all praying for you. You were a wonderful manager, but you were so much more than that. you'll be missed, but we are most definitely happy for you.
Thank you and congratulations on becoming a Liverpool legend  Jürgen Klopp. Ynwa
Take a Time Out.. then... Germany Trainer ! PLS ! :)
Nothing lasts forever… when time is up, it’s time to end..
Jurgen Klopp has taken a smart and wise decision... It is really not an easy decision for any one in his position or status, but i guess it is better to always leave "when the ovation is loudest". However he resumed with the club when the club needed a change, and he has succeeded with taking the name and the club "Liverpool" amongst champions. So its now up to club ownership/management to choose the next good coach/manager. Sensitive and vulnerable times ahead for the club.
Отец ты ЛЕГЕНДА не только нашего клуба но и всего мирового футбола! Любое твоё решение нужно принимать. Спасибо за сказку ❤
Wow what a talk... I hope that everyone, maybe one day would be so honest and straight forward. Full support!!! The guy wants to live a normal life ❤ absolutley has right to do so
klopp will never be forgotten, and we can never thank him enough for what he has done for us. pure love for him <3 YNWA
all I liked about Liverpool FC was this man. Saying as a chelsea fan
Liverpool need to win this season as the last present for their's DAD, Jurgen Klopp
Well, I know the real reason why Jurgen is leaving. He doesn't get support by the club owners. Tired is the honest answer, I know how struggle he has to compete with the rest top of clubs in the Premier League such City, Newcastle, Chelsea, Tottenham, and MU. Those have tons of money and are willing to spend for test and trial to buy new players, new tactics and so on. I think Jurgen is the best coach in the past 10 years. Jurgen is deserved to train bigger clubs such Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munchen.
Emotional watching that. And I'm a norwich fan. YNWA Klopp
jurgen slop
don't come back
It may well keep Liverpool really on it for the rest of the season in his name. Be nice to see them take it from Man City. I'm a neutral. Liverpool seem the most likely to me. Man City will still be right there until the end. We all know that much.
Thanks for everything Jurgen.. i can't thank you enough for the incredible transformation of the the club i love most.. from day 1 you made a difference,  so many great memories.. we'll never forget.. and you'll never walk alone.. we all need time to live, time to rest, all the best going forward boss, you truly deserve it, God bless you and your family. Legend!
Respect to you klopp
Thanks for everything I'm sad u are leaving but I'm glad n Happy you will live a normal life and spend more time with your family.  You are more than a coach u are a father figure u made us look at football a whole different way u brought competition this man is The GREATEST TO EVER DO farewell Legend . YOU WILL NEVER WORK ALONE 😭😭😭😭
Sad news but happy the departure is on his terms. Now for your final and greatest moment, bring hope the League title!!!
Absolutely one of the GREATEST MENTORS on the pitch. The club will notice his absence more than any player poached.
Strong Klopp
Ab in die woke Buntenliga
I'm United Fans. But i cry watching this video 😢
Klopp is a true Hero! Heja BVB 🖤💛
Thank you Jurgen , what a truly great and inspirational Leader and Coach you are. Your contribution to the club is intangible its part of the legend, myth and history we love so much. To the fans the Kop End will always be, I suggest the new Stand have Klopp Corner. Forever thankful, as a Liverpool fan my /our utmost gratitude and thanks.  Overwhelming pride to have had you, as our leader.
Barcelona
From a Chelsea fan, it’s a shame to see him leave the Premier League. Hat off!
Jürgen bester Mann, hat so viele Jungs aus der strasse geholt und zum fussballer gemacht.
Respect for the boss !
I know that the season is not over yet and there are still many games with you, and no matter how it ends if we lose or if we win, I just want to tell you that thank you for everything Jürgen, thank you for making me love this this club, Thank you for all these years that perhaps were not always the best or the most successful, I will always have good memories of them, Jürgen at the end of the season may be the last time we see you in Anfield but even if so I hope you always remember that you will never walk alone
As a Arsenal fan and a football fan I would like to congratulate on your amazing achievements in  football. Your pre and post match interviews always make compulsive  viewing .I would like to wish you all the best for the future. God bless you and your family. ❤
There is time in premier league i was jealous from another team but in ur time sir jurgon that’s team feeling jealous from us thanks and ynwa big love
Klopp is a top class manager. A true character and gentleman! As a United fan I´m happy, of the rival side of this decision. But he will sure be missed in the Premier League. Big respect to this man, and Liverpool too!
So the truth is that hes full of energy, but wants to quit because he MAY be tired at one point?  Thats bullshit.
We’ll miss the Klopp effect. Win or lose, he’s always smiling.
A formidable coach, personality and human being. I’m sure his decision is gonna hurt both ways, team / team fans but also himself. Life is about change and changes and  he deserve that pause, that stop so he can restart another adventure “successful for sure” elsewhere.  All the best to one of the best.
I'll just say one thing. Wife.
What a great coach! Klopp is unique.
he will be in Real Madrid in 1.5 years
This is probably the best possible way the Klopp era can end.   - Klopp leaves on his own terms unlike wenger/mourinho/ranieri etc. - The club is in a good position and the team is rebuilt for the next manager - The club has time to look for a replacement - The team is given a boost to finish the possible quadruple season strong  Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
Barcelona next?
One of the greatest managers of all time. I know he would like to challenge himself and go to a club in difficulty situation and make them great again like he did to Dortmund and Liverpool but I would love to see him as a Real Madrid manager.  All the best. What a man👍🏼Respect
Thanks jurgen for letting liverpool fans change "from doubter to believer" 😢😢
I am crying
You’re the real GOAT❤️ will miss you
Manchester United fans typing and deleting😆😆
I have so much respect for Klopp. What a frank and sincere interview.
Respect ❤
Amazing what the Universe does  Kloppo and Pep (especially during laid back but fatigued moments) have their faces and characters morphing into some similarities. The winning hierarchy honestly is scary: The Man who won Back to Back with the Boks ‘Rassie’ similar intensity but elaborative during briefings.))  Awesome 🎉 Man  Awesome 🎉 Mentor Greatest Human ❤
How many managers get to leave on their own terms?
A magnificent maturity, a wonderful life analysis, a magnificent self-reflection that shows that the ego is zero, congratulations, Coach is a fan from Turkey.
I actually got really used to seeing Klopp as the manager
Now Liverpool will be just another club like Man U or Barca
What a guy, such class
I could tell at the start of the season. Just not interested anymore. Wants to go home.
I have seen the careers of many coaches over the years, but I have never seen one more honest, loved and respected than Klopp (not in PL).  I hope to see you coaching again in the future, regardless of the team or country, that will definitely be the team of many thanks to you. Good luck in life, Mr. Klopp! ❤  PS: I'm trying to respect his wish, but it's hard for me, I'm still devastated.😢
He is a future Real Madrid manager.
Terimakasih Mr klop,telah membuat sejarah di Anfield
he is heading to old trafford!
Fix dia mau ke Indonesia
Something got in both my eyes at the ending :'( We will always remember you Jurgen, thanks for everything, when my children ask about you, I will tell them what an spectacular time we had together. You will never ever walk alone
se va al barca
no liverpool fan here but it's actuallly make me sad the fact he'll leave
What a guy!
Sir, the whole world of LIVERPOOL fans loved you. This club means a lot to me. Red has been my favorite color since I was a baby.thats what my mom told me. No matter what,LIVERPOOL went through those years. Since your arrival to this Wonderful club ❤.  Style of play totally  changed. Rejuvenated the fans with your techniques.  We are all going to miss you,Sir Jurgen Klopp. From Fiji Island's 🇫🇯  ♥️ Y❤N❤W❤A❤
How lucky is Mr. Klopp to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard :) ❤
I hope he tries punditry for a while - he’d be absolutely amazing 😂
Man, I’m emotional and I’m an Arsenal fan.  You’ll be sorely missed, by everyone, Jürgen. You’ve been a great ambassador of the Premier League and it won’t be the same without you.  I personally understand and respect your decision. It’s not easy, at all, a job like that at a club like that - with such huge expectations.  Auf Wiedersehen, König 🫡 👑
Jürgen Klopp was an amazing manager. If it wasn't for him, Liverpool wouldn't have been were it is right now. Good luck Klopp. Love from a Man City fan.
This man came to the club during one of their darkest hours and brought it back to light once more. The Premier League title and the UCL where not his biggest accomplishments in Liverpool. It was waking up a (badly) wounded giant back to glory. Thank you for everything, Mr. Klopp. I'm sure you'll always be remembered with affection by those who love Liverpool Football Club.
I am a Madridista. I put a huge respect on him. Thank you for the rivalry, waiting for next. Good luck Jurgen Klop ❤
Coming go to 🇹🇭
City broke this guy he cannot catch them so he opted to leave!
I am from Malaysia..Please Please leave when only your contract end, Mr Klopp.😭😭
He will be missed. Not all great things last. We love you Klopp🥺🫡❤️🐐

as AC Milan fan, I've always respected and admired the Liverpool spirit. Great challenges between our clubs, great managers and players, great supporters. Jurgen brough the sun back to Liverpool when they needed and as the comments shows, he conquered his supporters above every field achievement. Great spirti, great interview, all the best to everyone for the incoming future!
Couldn't even begin to imagine the stress of being a manager for this club. He has done the club proud, we are/were very lucky to have had him as a manager, he will always be a legend YNWA. All the best for the future.
If you have burn out, you need to step back.
The best legacy anyone can leave behind is the people who's lives they've changed! Thanks Jürgen!
So he’s going to Real?
We love you Klopp♥️ You'd never walk again 💯
열심히 한 모습이 얼굴에 보이는게 멋있다
Hope he is alright, but lets face facts, it football, no one is dying.
From a Bolton fan I can honestly say this man will be sorely missed, not just at Liverpool but all English football... I was worried Liverpool were in trouble until he arrived. They've always had the talent they just lost consistent leadership, especially after Gerrard hung his boots up, too. It seemed like there were too many holes to fill to rebuild on, but what he's done has been both entertaining and phenomenal. Something about the guy just makes everything seem fun again, like every decision could lead to an education or entertainment. He never made the fans carry the weight of his mood like many other prem managers do. Also the dedication and trust he inspires from him players is rare in the mainstay prem teams today. Yet he's built an inspirational team of not just the men on the pitch but also fans they can be proud to represent. As both always show inclusion and good sportsmanship, worthy of the team that's back to being the pinnacle of British football.  I genuinely hope Liverpool continue to build on and honour the legacy he's built and whoever you find to take over is up to the job.  👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾 YNWA 👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
All my respect to you Jurgen Klopp. From a Manchester United fan.
Jürgen, Now you started this interview by saying that you love everything about this club but is that true? Hand on heart, can you really say that you love the English weather? After the weather we have had over the last 7 months I can’t blame you if you wasn’t to step down and go in search of some warmth and sunshine! Thank you for everything and enjoy  life with your family.👏🫶☀️❤️
🥺😢
wow uterley magical, 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Jürgen du tust das richtige so schön!!!In dieser schlimmen Weltzeit, in einer "gefallenen Menschenwelt" hab ich Dich stets als BVB Fan geschätzt.  Ich freue mich sehr für Dich, dass Du das wahre Leben kennen lernen willst und die Entscheidung getroffen hast. Der Herr Jesus kommt bald und es gibt durchaus noch wichtigeres als Fussball auch wenn es die schönste Nebensache ist. Der Herr Jesus segne und behüte Dich und weiße Dir den neuen Weg den du gehen sollst nach seinem Wohlgefallen. In Jesu Namen. Liebe Grüße Raphael
This guy always brings the warmest feelings. Good luck Juergen!
What a life!
He is the most beautiful soul of coaches in professional football in my opinion. And He means it when He says it - its over - but He will do everything He can Till the Last day. Best man on earth. Hope we see him again. Kloppo - ruh dich aus und komm zurück - scheissegal wo - du wirst dir ein denkmal setzen - noch eins ❤
He’s a fucking coward
Politically incorrect version: "I'm bored."
All the best Jürgen . U will never b forgotten. A legend.
👓💞💞💞💞💞🙏🙏
Wenn du als Manager gehst und die Fans weinen dir hinterher ist das mehr wert als jeden Titel den du gewonnen hast. Jogi Löw wurde mit Deutschland Weltmeister und die Fans waren froh als er entlassen wurde. Jürgen Klopp ist für mich Sinnbild des Fußballs geworden als TV Experte 2006 bei der WM in Deutschland. Er hat mit seiner sympatichen Art jedem den Fußball nahe gebracht und auch die taktiken erklärt. Das war der Moment für mich das ich zu einem Fan eines Trainers wurde und es geliebt habe alles von diesem Mann zu verfolgen. Jürgen Klopp du bist das beste Aushängeschild das Deutschland hat. Ich glaube es gibt wenig Fußballbegeisterte die nicht wissen was für ein großartiger Trainer du bist. Danke das du Deutschland ein so sympathisches Gesicht nach außen gibst.
I always said, NO ONE will EVER replace Bill Shankly! Then along came Jurgen and I had to admit I was wrong! VERY wrong! Like Bill, Jurgen brought us all together - the club, the team, the fans and together we knew the feeling of being champions of the country, Europe and...THE WORLD! And that is what you will ALWAYS mean to me, Jurgen - THE WORLD!!! Thank you for everything! YNWA
Can you take Pep with you?
A legend. Sad for him to leave but 100% know where he is coming from. Life is more important than work. Family first 🙏🏻
I hate Liverpool with a burning passion.. Why does this make me emotional?? I need mental therapy..
Klopp! Cant find any words... Im crushed. ❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you for everything! Y.N.W.A! Greeting from Sweden ❤🤍❤🤍❤🤍❤
Sublime judgement the man has
Was für ein idiomatisches Englisch! Welch ein Trainer! Der Beste für die EM 2024!
im a manchester united fan but this broke my heart .
It is a remarkable episode of the club history, we are GLAD you have been around 🎉🎉🎉
So much respect for this man. So so much. From Italy.
I still don’t understand why he’s leaving though
Great guy, great coach! If you change your mind you could give us a little hand here at AC Milan!
Difficile à accepter.  Merci grand homme, grand manager
Legendary manager, thank for increddible matches and for everything im City fan, but i respect you a lot Jurgen, thank you again LEGEND.
I can see a man with the right choice ,for himself and the club. The "I am burnt out" comment gave it away , being a manager of a prestigious club comes with lot of pressure.

Jürgen Klopp leaving Liverpool 🥹  January 31, 2024
He is a marvelous human being.
Jürgen Klopp 🥹  January 31, 2024
You raised the bar and brought entertaining and fun football to the highest level possible. Your charisma and passion for the club was shown with trophies and hard work. Amazing to have witnessed this in my time as a human ❤ YNWA Jurgen Klopp you will be missed.
I hear his going to man united  too 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why is he on this small chair. Couldn’t you make it more comfortable? He is a legend and we will mis him 😢
I wish the best for Jürgen as a football fan, he is great.
What a man, never seen another manager treat his players the way he has when they leave the pitch after playing and I suspect that is how he treats all concerned with Liverpool. Perhaps some politicians and other managers should look at how they treat their employees. Wish him all the best for whatever he does as he is correct there comes a time when age etc catches up and you need to put the brakes on and examine and take stock of your lifestyle.
Extraordinary human being! Hut ab!
Thank you for everything ❤
It’s impressive how Fabrizio Romano didn’t find out that he was leaving since November
I'm not even gonna say "as a fan of etcetera club"  i think Premier league will never be the same without this man
Who gives an f
Granting this interview without your customary hat and glasses presents you differently and further conveys your message.  Thanks, Klopp, for your fantastic years at Liverpool FC. Good luck for your future.
What a journey that was ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ we walked through the Wind we walked through the Storm and at the end there was always a golden Sky.... Thank u Jürgen❤❤❤
The only mistake he made was replacing the keeper who gave him the Champions League matches for the keeper who gave it away.  What a good  trainer he is.
G.O.A.T.! Take your time and come back soon.
You are a living legend
I am from switzerland and can say, german people are one of the coolest people on earth! . normally swiss people hates germans... I still dont know why tf xD.. They are so funny and cool... nothing fake... just honest and fun people
I have so much respect for this man's honest and heartfelt decision. I'm a lifelong United fan who always loved what he brought to Liverpool and the Premier league. We all wish an enjoyable life.
this is bad news
Brave and classy decision from a brave classy man! An absolute legend that made football history that beauty!
love him
Ihr lieben Liverpooler! Ihr könnt ihm ein ewiges Denkmal setzen, indem Ihr möglichst viele Eurer Kinder "JÜRGEN" nennt!❤
Average manager. Fair play Jurgen. You've made your money now go and enjoy it with your family
All clubs will want him
He will go to Manchester lol
He did a great job!! when he returns to work after a couple years off. I’m sure he just wants a job were he could just coach and not have to worry about being a general manager. I smell Barcelona Next.
What a legend! Hoffe du findest eine neue Aufgabe, die dich wieder zu 100% erfüllt.
Thank you, Jurgen. Thank you for all. And never forget, YNWA

Hes so german 🥲😄
end of an era :((( thank you jurgen
Legend. Best Manager. YNWA greetings from Dortmund.
I think him being a master tactician means that he’s almost certainly making the right call about retirement.  Rest up and relax Klopp! 🎉❤
Lieber Jürgen Klopp, wir sind so stolz auf Dich, als auch ein phantastischer Botschafter Deutschlands 🇩🇪 in England! Schenke den großartigen Fans von Liverpool zum Abschluss noch mal eine Meisterschaft! Lang lebe der FC Liverpool - lang lebe der 1.FC Köln! ❤ Viele Grüße aus Nordrhein-Westfalen nach UK!🫶
Klopp isn't my favourite Manager ever since he sidelined T. Minamino [who is currently #8 of Japanese National Team] from 2020~22.
professionalism at its best
kind of sad that he never trained any Top-Club in his carrier. Dortmund is a numer 2 club, liverpool is top 4 club. But he never trained the clubs with the big names (Barcelona, Real, Manchester United, Juventus)
🖤💛
Mr. Klopp thanks for leaving Liverpool for the German Nationalteam.
I always believed that yes, he has German blood but he also possesses many of the Mediterranean mentalities that people in southern Europe do.  So this is typical of a German but also shows the temperament of the south.  He is not happy how first, the premiere league, is disrespect him, not taking into consideration his appeals for the lousy scheduling and other operational mechanisms, and also he doesn't like how the Liverpool leadership values some players over him, see Salah.  So he is announcing his resignation until he takes it all back in the summer, after he leaves for a long summer vaca, and comes back as a hero for changing his mind, meanwhile he will get a blank check to do whatever he likes and his voice will now be heard and respected everywhere and anywhere.  Kudos to him!
Congratulations to klopp on managing to get Liverpool as big as Blackburn and Leicester with there one premier League title 😂
We are gonna miss you Klopoo so much. ❤❤
He's breathtaking 😆
It sound like he was threatened to resign. I am running out of energy haha.
Jürgen will always do what's best for the club. You can really tell how much he loves Liverpool.
Einmal Mainzer immer Mainzer, wir warten❤️🤍💛
LOVE
Burnout 🤔. Something happening in back office hidden from view. However 9 yrs seem to be his MO.
He will go down as a decent manager
Take your time Jurgen, you deserved it
All the best Sir for your move 😢
Apart from your wife who is the first person you told?? In case you didn't know, you are unique in your approach. "The normal one"😂 Relax!!
Its obvious that he is burned out. Hope he gets better.
You will forever be a Legend Mnr Klopp🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽😢🫡🙏🏽🫶🏽
I know you the rite one but your decision you just made is a family one love you even if your not here anymore you the best of the best
wish there was more trainers like him!,passionate,honest,spontanous man,a real legend!,he will be missed after this last season ,i Love Liverpool and Dortmund,maybe because i love Jurgen Klopp!,greetings  from the Netherlands
Fantastic coach and manger for the reds!
This gets me every time I watch it.😥 JK will be missed. What an exceptional individual.
Take care of your health KİNG👑 we all love you🌍 best off luck❤
I love Jurgen! We accept it and support you. We’re all human, it’s completely understandable. Thank you for all you’ve done for the EPL!
Guy is tired and rich time to chill out
I already know he is coming to Barca cause Klopp even tho mentioning that he wants to leave Liverpool to recharge his batteries he doesn’t say the most obvious thing for that matter which is to take a break from coaching also Barcelona even tho Xavi failed hard didn’t sack him and already announced that he’ll be leaving in June no matter what which means there’s a deal with a coach that isn’t a free agent and has a running contract, all signs are there.
Good wishes from Germany Hamburg 🥰👋🇩🇪👨‍👩‍👦
whatever the reason, he is a legend, was before he went to England, will be whatever he is gonna do in the future. mad respect, Kloppo.
what a guy, you'll miss him like wie BVB fans missed or have been missing him ever since. So now, our clubs will be even closer together if you ask me <3 YNWA
Nooooooooooooooooo
To be honest, Pep Guardiona dominated and destroyed him. I would quit too 🤣🤣 1 year break then either Bayern Münih or 100 million per saison to Saudi Camelia
Grüße aus Deutschland ;)  i think the only german person which english people now like :P hahah
now arsenal will beat Liverpool
Lo voy a extrañar mas que a mi papá 😔
Absolute Legend!👏👏👏
😢😢 you are briliant !
Who cares.....? It is just a football circus about Money, it has no meaning to the world where Klopp is filling his pockets.
😭
Klopp made me enjoy watching Liverpool play, and as a Chelsea fan, that's saying something...  I wish him all the best, the premier league won't be the same without him. 👏
What a super guy. As a Dutch guy I just hope he doesnt get bored and coach the German national squad as they will become invincible🙏😱
Thank you klop  for everything 😢👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Good luck and many thanks for the great memories Jurgen. Love you more than the wife.
Читаю комментарии и вижу, искрение и честные добрые слова в адрес Юргена фанатов разных клубов. Мне кажется пустота на душе, после этой новости не только у фанатов LFC, но и всех любителей футбола - мне кажется это и есть главный показатель, главная оценка Юргена! Мне кажется самое главное достижение Клоппа - это любовь всех фанатов футбола, не только болельщиков команды, которую он тренирует. Удачи тебе Юрген. С любовью и уважением из России!!!
He is honest. He has reached his maximum. Rest and new venture will be helpful. Departing in disappointment not needed. Give them premier League title.
Truly one in a million.
True genuine honest  and straight to the heart … well done JK ! you have just created a new league and breed of Coaches ❤️
Lest go he's leaving its going to be easy to win man city
What's most impressive is that he turnt "I'm going to Barcelona" into a 24 minute interview
Such an honorable man. Respect!  Though I am not a liverpool fan, I also feel a sense of loss.  Football will miss Jürgen Klopp.
who cares
ผมมองว่า ฮันซี่ ฟลิค มีเปอร์เซ็นต์สูงสุด โปรไฟล์ดี คว้าแชมป์มาแล้ว บารมีถึงแน่นอน เยอรมันอีกแถมว่างงานอีกตอนนี้😊🎉
Klopp statue in liverpool will be nice
Respect for Jurgen Klopp, great manager and so down to earth. Love it
Kloppo war viel mehr, als nur ein Trainer. Selbst aus Deutschland muss ich sagen, was waren das für überragende Jahre bei Liverpool. Es hat einfach Spaß gemacht. Danke Kloppo, danke Liverpool. ❤
vielleicht Bundeskanzler?
Dickste Eier ever. ❤
Is Klopp okay health wise?
I'm 27 years old, I'm a BVB (Borussia Dortmund) Fan, there was not a single instance in my life, where Jürgen Klopp wasn't a legend. I'm sorry you guys have to feel, what I have felt 9 years ago. When he left Dortmund my world was dying. I'm so happy you guys had the joy of Klopp being your manager. And he made me a LFC Fan as well.  I really hope he rests well and gets better. We Love you. Everyone. LFC and BVB does. YNWA <3
When Klopp is running out of energy , world has lost its inertia and inspiration..As an Arsenal fan I will always miss Klopp in my life..Wish, he comes to India to develop football..India will give him new energy..Even in the worst Arsenal time ,Klopp was inspirational.
Nothing but great respect for this man.
Barca waiting ❤️
I hope he applies train the German team which has been slumping during the last years.
Alles richtig gemacht der Jürgen, ich hab den schon nach ein paar Minuten verstanden, aber man merkt wie sehr er niemanden enttäuschen will. Ich kann das alles zu 100% nachvollziehen, es gibt noch ein Leben zu genießen und die Energie wird nunmal weniger und man muß lernen hauszuhalten  Bin gespannt wo seine Reise hingeht. Manchmal muß man loslassen, um sich selbst wieder spüren zu können und das Feuer neu zu entfachen. Und ich finde den Umgang mit der frühen Entscheidung und das der Club auch früh informiert wurde sehr Charakterstark. Ich bin auch ein Freund davon die unangenehmen Entscheidungen dann zu fällen, wenn man nicht erst in einer schwierigen Situation ist, geht natürlich nicht immer, aber hat mir schon viel Ärger erspart.  Was ich aber beobachte, dass mehrere in meinem Bekanntenkreis so einen Schritt gehen, die sind im gleichen Alter wie Jürgen. Wahrscheinlich muß man sich nochmal neu erfinden, bevor man alt wird...
Come to UNITED Klopp lol 🤣😂⚽⚽⚽
Klopp going to Atletico!?
That means Liverpool will go for Xavi Alonso.
How will city have a title threat say sike now or I will find you wherever you are good luck not finding a ugandan child know
Sir Alex Fergerson retired at the age of 71 💪👌 UNITED UNITED UNITED ⚽⚽⚽⚽
Barcelona fan my whole live but i can admit the second team ive watched the most after Barca is Liverpool,they have always amazed me with their style and passion about this beautiful game , Klopp era will be remembered as one of the greatest in Liverpool History if not the best , this guy is special no words need to be added he is living LEGEND.
He could have stayed charging the club tons of pounds for another 2-3 years being 85% dedicated and no one would even notice. But it's not him. Respect Juergen, you're the boss. YNWA.
So sad this man is leaving 😢 i can't believe honestly ! Well im just sad.
He's getting rested in preparation to couch Real Madrid by 2026
어디에서 무엇을 하시든 항상 행복만이 가득하시길..! 클롭님께서 맡아주신 리버풀은 계신 8년동안 행복했고, 남은 기간 또한 행복할겁니다. 황홀했던 리버풀은 여기서 끝이 아니라 클롭 감독님이 만든 새로운 도약이며 신화이길 바랍니다. YNWA
YOU will never walk alone Klopp you are still part of us and we are part of you🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Klopp statue at Anfield incoming, mark my words. Also - being the next manager of the Reds will be the toughest challenge in pro soccer to come up. I do not envy the man who will try to fit in those enormous footprints.
Thanks mate to give me hope it might be not perfect as I wish but the way we walk with you was pretty exiting ..!!! You will never walk alone ..
He wants to come back to his family Mainz 05!
The amount of support for this man in the comments is truly inspiring- glad i watched.
Don't go, Klopp...
Devasted, but first and foremost thank you Boss for everything you have done. Not just football wise, but as an ambassador for the club and as a general all round decent human being. You'll be missed in bucket loads. YNWA.
Wow Hammer was für ein Typ Herr Klopp ist. Allergrößten Respekt, viel Erfolg für dieses Jahr.
Please stop talking you make me cry
sehr viel liebe . lieben sie auch die spieler frauen?¿
I remember his times in Germany: that was always what Juergen was like - he wants to perform on the highest Levels. So he always came when he had that opportunity, took the teams on a even higher level and left as a Legend. He is one of the best coaches out there, thats for sure!
The best🎉
Klop jurgen pretending so as to distract top top premier League contenders,,, remember back in the days when  arsene venger used to say one more time,,, 💋💋💋💋🧀🧀🧀🥂🍾 just these season only,,,,
Heavy salad…
United fan. big respect jurgen you came you seen you conquered. Go live you life free from scrutiny and spend time with the most important people family
Yes,he is and will be a great sportsman,manager,coach and hopefully - human beiing!!!But come on chat- its just soccer!!He didn't heal your mother or grandma from cancer!!He got big paychecks  from what he was and is doing.Bread and games for the sheeps..More important is that we people stand up against the elite- who are killing and trying to kill us...
legend 🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💯💯❤❤ nothing but respect to a man who has earned his freedom of what time he has left in this world.❤❤
I think he s bored couse of endless arabic fund.
Got say Jürgen klopp gonna miss you thank you for everything absolutely brilliant manger it's been 1 epic journey when you joined Liverpool i never did 1 marathon then but now ive done 184 now just in 4 years let's finish this season in style 💯💯👍👍😁
Schwabenpower <3
Enters Mourinho
A man who is self aware enough to know he has to look after himself as no 1 priority. Meaning take a break, and brave enough to say so. Respect.
Klopp to barcelona.   💯 guaranteed.
I'm crying 🥹🥲 Sir Jürgen Klopp, we do as you wish! YNWA! ❤️
Gotta admire his honesty,... Nothing lasts forever  Danke schon Jurgen God bless you ❤
Kloppus polarisiert alle Menschen,weil er der beste ist. Danke das ich dich erleben durfte.⚽❤
😢😢😢
Klopp ist ein ....hn
I thought there is no option to cancel his contract.
Jürgen you are wonderful. And our support will be always with you❤❤❤❤
I'm not even a Liverpool supporter, and for real, this is my very 1st time watching something on this channel, but I didn't even skip 1 sec of this. What a man, what a character!
Premier league won't be the same without him, good luck in the future Jurgen
Jürgen komm nach Hause,wir brauchen dich als deutschen Kanzler ❤
If I am a Liverpool fan, I would say: "Thank you, and remember.... Jurgen, You'll never walk alone.
❤ you man
KLOPPO FOR DFB
Danke Jürgen
im an arsenal fan, but i have witnessed this man has done everything for Liverpool. watched him since he took over and changed the direction of that club. such a great manager, he brought the harmony and he took Liverpool back to where they belong. rivalry aside, you will be missed sir. hats off
This is my favorite Football Manager - and I am not a Liverpool supporter either, but He is one of my most favorite human beings. This is what Diamonds are made of.
😂 man was sick of the bin dipping
I think one of the best / inspiring coaches around. He shows great balance between ratio and emotion....all for the game. got to love that...Funny thought...I hope he will take up the task to coach again one day... Why not a coach for a national team...for the Netherlands???  🙂
Much respect for you Jurgen, and you are human, we all understand that, thank you so much for what you did. 🙏🤗
10:24 ich gönne dir alles Kloppi, lebe ein normales Leben. Du hast es dir verdient! Aber solltest du Sehnsucht nach dem trainerleben haben, führe unsere Nationalmannschaft endlich wieder zu erfolgen. Wenn das einer kann dann Jürgen!
he is very bad manager
Weird watching this as a fan of a rival club, league isn't gonna be the same
He's like à movie actor
Good luck J.!
18:06 "Because nobody will sack me". Low-key a flex but much deserved, mad respect. YNWA.
What can we all learn from Klopp? Be honest to yourself and others, accept your limits as a human being and trust you inner voice. The best decisions sometimes feel painful and they are right anyway. Leaving the club the way he does it now, is the biggest proof how much he loves this club and how important it is for him to protect everything he established, for the future generation. I am sure he would love to continue his job, but he steps back, facing the truth and puts the common welfare first. Thanks Klopp for being an inspiring role model to so many people!
❤❤❤❤
If u have no soul and spirit to doing your job then you must try to stop and make new move or new job to refresh the energy. I feel you Mr Klopp, maybe you can give us (the kop) the best farewell in the end of season. Liverpool will always find out the way like they did before. Thank Mr Jurgen for the nine years you did in Liverpool. Thanks for the memories you share with us YNWA
i was a Chelsea supporter and I always feel guilty inside secretly admiring Liverpool of Klopp he brought the team to its highest level all we can ask please stay Mr Jurgen
. naikan gaji Klopp 😭
One of the honest and emotional humans in the world of football, i think. Therefore, he is a especially typ. God bless him❤
Jobangebot!:  Übungsleiter beim 1. FC Köln, Halbe Stelle, reicht für´s Mittelfeld, großzügige Vergütung, Karneval, lecker Mädche!, unbefristet!
One more season
Red to the bone. This man will never walk alone. Thanks for everything sir. The best LFC trainer in modern EPL.  YNWA
Amazing coach
.jangan pergi Klopp 😭
Klopp is a true role model for me, even though I'm not a footballer at all. Knowing that tens of thousands of boys (and maybe girls too;-)) around the world have chosen him as their idol brings tears to my eyes and gives me hope for the future.
His energy is gone....look in the face.
I knew the day would come someday. But I didn't know how much surprising to me. It is far bigger than I thought. I really appreciate what you have done for Liverpool and us.  We will walk along with you forever.
Pep is probably joyful that his competition is going
You can get the Boss out of LVP but not LVP out of the one and only Sir Jürgen Klopp! YNWA! 🖤
Love EVERYTHING about the city🤔
Ja for sure
Because Barca is calling
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Won EPL, UCL. Thanks Klopp. Arguably one of the greatest coaches ever.
Hé feels defeated by pep
Come to Besiktas 🦅
마지막인데 퍼기형 처럼 우승하고 갔으면
Ayo Klopp, tetap di Liverpool.
hari tersedih dalam hidupku life must go on Ty klopp
komm zu bayern
😢
nice Interview, wery good Person
YNWA ❤ Klopites love you forever
Shedded tears…
Christian man, Christian  ethics and values.. the country will miss him because heaven knows we need more role models of his ilk, not less
Favorite manager ever. What a leader. What a human. How rare. ❤
noooooooo🥲
im a man u fan and i love klopp's style right  from mainz and dortmund..much love from uganda.
Wherever he works he is being loved. He doesn’t belong to Liverpool. He belongs to football. His story in Mainz and Borussia is as good as Liverpool one. Probably one of the best managers ever, defo the nicest and greatest man!
I’m a united fan but I remember when Klopp first joined Liverpool and he said he would win the premier league within 4 years, I remember thinking “yeah fucking right this guy is deluded”, then of course he did. Had mad respect for him ever since as a manager and would love to have seen him as a united coach but Liverpool is where he belonged, some of the attacking football he produced there and the signings he made were unreal.
Amalfi coast is calling 😂😂. Now that’s a challenge. Forza Napoli sempre ❤❤
Even when he leaves and makes you sad with his decision..he is still a gentleman..love you man. ..i Hope we  will meet again sometime ❤️
He knows Arteta is eclipsing him now ,so he better leave early to save his legacy 😅😅😅
he might be taking the team of Germany in the future
Fast forward to the end of the Premier League season…..and the 2023/2024 Champions are Liverpool⚽️  The Liverpool fans and players “This one’s for you Jurgen Klopp” ❤️
Build him a Statue Good Luck without him from Germany   Jürgen komm nach Hause wir brauchen nen neuen Nationaltrainer
Dortmund fans feel with you, it was hard when he left us, too, but life goes on :)
Amazing manager, can't help thinking if Pep wasn't at the helm he'd be going nowhere.
You've got to appreciate his honesty. He wants to live a normal life after committing so much of his time. His energy is spent, let him rest 😊. He'll take some time out and maybe he'll come back after he's rejuvenated, but that's up to him.
whaattttt
I'm a utd fan but have to say what a manager and more importantly what a guy.  Total respect to him and what he did for Liverpool. As painful as it to say that 😂
What a manager. What a legend. What a guy. What a legacy!
Klopp leaves a full plate there ... No complaint ... Have a nice holiday klopp
Good luck Klopp and thank you for your charisma, personality and bringing  something unique to the premier league. I’m not a Liverpool fan but congratulations
Dude's seen the writing on the wall
I love you so much Klopp❤
I’m not even a Liverpool fan but the love Klopp has for your team is something I haven’t seen before. Respect to him. Sad he’s leaving. But there is no better way of doing it then he did. 😮
He will Go Saudi Arabia,definitely
Cant blame him. Gr8 era hes created but people need to move on. Wengers and fergies are rare in this industry
Lucky to be around and witnessing your work of magic with the squad in the Reds, you will be miss ...YNWA
He is going to be a great national coach. I could see him coaching England or Germany. Winning a title with the national team would be legendary.
This is a really good example of how (in a good way) to say goodbye from something (can also be a relationship) and be as honost as possible.
Klopp is a living legend! He will always be more than a manager! I will miss his passion ❤
he will be the coach of german national team because they lost their winner character so many years ago and become like a kind of swedish team. I am hundred percent sure
A wonderful human being with a beautiful soul!
i need just crying ... warum Jurgen ?
❤YNWA❤
잘가 클롭😢
Thank you coach for making many titles and changes for the club. You are one of the best coaches for the Liverpool team.
Enjoy life to the fullest Jürgen, one of the greatest.
El es lo mejor que sucedio en los ultimos anios para el futbol mundial. Thank you Kloppo!
A class human 👏 ❤🎉
Came to Nagasaki❗ a former(?) coach　left  V・Nagasaki illegally for Brazil to deal with Santos.  All We need　is you Jurgen❗
He has been a massive breath of fresh air to the prem.  Proper decent bloke, god help who replaces him.
He is so cool guy
Don't forgot kloppooo is bvb
Ach Kloppo - schade, aber definitiv verständlich - dir einen schönen Ruhestand! Schönen Gruß aus Dortmund!
His words and his love and loyality (17:10!) to LFC are so special and honest... That man is unique!  No single negative word in 18.000 user comments.. never saw sth like that!  He made me feel proud to be a german for the first time... Jürgen for president!  Love him..
This is more motivational than any motivational video out there. carpe diem guys, seize the day
I’m not a Liverpool fan but I love Jorgen Klopp he is a really really really good manager…… one of the best of obviously…. Do whatever you think is right and whatever makes you happy Klopp
let me mix your interview next time ⚽
😢
As a United fan. Theres no Liverpool without Klopp
because liverpool can't afford mbappe
I respect his comments so much what a bloke ! Wish you well in future
Klopp you'll never walk alone u have taken liverpool to new heights will miss u at anfield
I am a manu supporter from Turkey. But I love this man very much, I am trying to follow his statements, I was as sad as I was when Sir Alex Ferguson left. But I console myself by saying Jurgen needs this. Thank you for all the moments and everything you gave us and made us experience.
He’s just not as excited anymore
He deserved after all the years of Hardware to find peace with his family and spend time with them life is too short i understand him great Manager a Legend.
Jurgen has realised he's been lied to....City were the good guys after all
Deeply impressed with his choice. Amazing man.
Manchester United fan here. Jurgen Klopp is a class act and a brilliant manager. The Premier League will be worse off with him gone ❤
Legend! Great last season Klopp YNWA❤
i came as a normal guy, im still a normal guy i just dont live a normal life. and i dont want to wait til im to old for having a normal life. Hard and wise words Klopp YNWA
Who is next in line?
Klopp will get the biggest respect of all fans and other footbal fans bye Klopp
when you’re running out of energy in sports it really is the best decision to take a step back.  re-fuel and maybe if the circumstances are right, start again.   it’s like going to sleep but you didn’t get the rest.
He made me hate Liverpool less and given how successful he's been there, that is quite a feat.
I don't even support Liverpool and I'm sad
No quiero ver esto 😢
everything u've done for the club, for the sport  we are forever grateful....YNWA
I wish we’d see him in a couple years as coach of the German national team. That’ll be awesome and Germany needs a charakter like him. But for now I wish him all the best.
come to germany jurgenn🥺... we luvvv uuu
i think the honorable thing to do is keep him around the Team. any other position .Thank you sir Klopp
Dear Admin... Thanks for Bahasa Indonesia caption... God Bless you, Mr Klopp and family... 😢😢😢
I don't support Liverpool but I absolutely love Jürgen Klopp. I just wonder if Liverpool will go like United when Ferguson left
absolutely legend
Rest a year and come back, you need it but don’t leave forever
From a true tick. God love you. Met you at murrayfeild v napoli  Humbble no acting man. Then met you in istanbul v chelsea , Take care 🙂
Jurgen plz join Barcelona you will find your second home here
The Great Heisenberg 👑
If he’s body is tired he just need a good well sleep, but he’s heart was tired. No support from the top, no transferring, thank you for bringing the joy and excitement to premier league! 🫡
POV:Midlifecrisis
Sir Klopp
Not sure how we replace Klopp. We have had good managers over the years and we expect an A-grade manager to follow in Klopp's footsteps.
Chosing the right time to leave is the absolute wisdom for anyone who wishes to be remembered and loved. well done Jurgen and I salute your honesty 🙏🙏
The best possible way to announce it
Iam a United fan but it hurts to see this guy leave. Much respect for what he has achieved over the years with Liverpool. Great coach, superb personality. Nothing but respect. It's a tough call but you deserve a break. Best wishes Kloop.
I hipe situation will be not the same as MU after Ferguson
Jurgen is a legend and will always be missed even I m a city fan🙏
As a Barca fan, we'll sure miss you Klopp ❤ - why do I have a feeling he's not feeling very well and it's pretty serious.😢
You will never walk alone klopp
Germany national team?
what a coach, come to Barcelona 😁
You can tell he’s tired. Props to him realizing it, and doing something about it. Probably the hardest decision he’s ever going to make in his life.
As a football fan it'll be sad not having klopps presence in the Premier league, but as a united fan I'm delighted he's moving on.  Hopefully he takes the England job after the euros and we go on to win the world cup
You need to relax. I want to see again for coach Liverpool
ผมจะไม่ลืมคุณตลอดไป
Am an arsenal fan but i hope Liverpool wins the league or Europa league for this great man 👊🏾
we love you forever ever
A true man isn’t afraid of showing their vulnerability. What a man, what a manager. ❤❤
Regardless of the club you support we all agree this man is a Legend
Equipo de epoca, "el Liverpool de Klopp", exitos en el futuro Jürgen!
You'll never walk alone. That's this once in a lifetime coach, we're proud to have had him, we in Dortmund are still proud today and have always looked to you in Liverpool with pride that he found the same home with you as he did with us. If this loyalty does not deserve to be honored, who does?
You'll never walk alone❤
This can be put into one sentence I love Liverpool I love the fans I love the city, but I've had enough.
back to 2010-2015😢
as a united fan I wish you came to United instead, but at the same time I'm glad you didn't too - because our owners would tarnish your legacy  Get a good rest sir. Hopefully this isn't the last that we're seeing Jurgen Klopp in football
i'm sad.
Thank you for everything. amazing journey!
Because he told little Dáire (kid in a wheelchair) that he will never walk alone
The Ground Breaker
u left dortmend early now u doing it again good luck to ya why sign till 2026 only to leave early anyway life goes on sorry klopp but no manager is bigger than our beloved lfc
Cheers for the easy ucl finals jurgen and the boys at Liverpool from Madrid!! Seriously tho the guys a true legend
Istri polisi : bhayangkari Istri kpps : bhayang-bhayang
Thanks coach I have also retired as a fan! I won’t support any club again but I love Liverpool. I’m with Jurgen!!
You made a history already for Liverpool, hopefully will get a trophy this season and best of luck, a lot of respect and love, we will never walk alone ✊
NUR DIE AfD!
Jurgen, thanks for everything.   Quit the smokes 🚬 (if rumors are true). Skin color has been bothering me these last few months. Sallow.   I’m wrong I’m sure but 😢YNWA
German Men ❤
Great interview good man, best wishes, Declan😃
Remember Jurgen, Thank you
😢😢😢
Klopp not only brings achievements to Liverpool, but more importantly, makes more football fans love Liverpool.
“We are Liverpool, we went through harder things together, and you went through harder things before me. Let’s make a strength of it; that would be really cool. Let’s squeeze everything out of the season and have another thing to smile about when we look back in the future - Jurgen Norbert Klopp, Jan 2024 via Liverpool FC.”
As an United fan, I hope we will find a coach like Klopp in the future. Hat off to you, Jurgen Klopp
He sounds like he fucking hates the place 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@mickmcknight162 1 second ago I think Jurgen is doing the right thing, 'cause 9 years is a long time in anybody's life, and long gone are the days when bosses would be there for 20 years. He probably wants 15 years away from the game completely to do quality things with his family and friends before he's too old, and becomes regretful for not having more interests in life, and spending time doing other things. I'd say many a manager regretted that part of the dynamic. Life's too short; simple as. Time to move on
Thanx u very much Papa Klopp  , we'll always love , forever ❤❤❤  YNWA
You will never walk alone
I seen this guy take a mid level dortmund to a ucl final
리버지
All the best klopp, maturnuwun 🙏
Welcome to Sweden and AIK Jürgen! (A man can dream, can't he?)
nooo don't leave the next coach might give Mo Salah to saidu league's
Leave at the helm rather than the pit!  Football today is politics and £€$.....amazing endeavour amazing achievement 👏
I love you more than you can imagine! You were the best thing that ever happened to LFC and you will always be the greatest thing ever happened to LFC
Kloppo einfach Legende ! Bester Mann 😢
From a Real Madrid fan, farewell Klopp. It was a nice rivalry we had with Livepool in the UCL, fortunately we had many good(and bad) matches and memories with you. Wishing you the best!
His honesty, clarity, humility, integrity, and class are extremely rare, not just in football and in sports but in any walk of life. A truly remarkable and admirable man. I wish you the very best, Jurgen, for the rest of the season and for the next stage(s) of your journey. Thank you for caring so much and for being an outstanding role model. 🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍
The Kop and Klop will be in our hearts
Jurgen come to Barca.
Fantastic person!!! an amazing coach! he brought Liverpool to the top of the world has kept them competitive and a force to be recon in the world of football!!! i will always respect Jurgen and the super team for what they did to Barcelona (my team). Football has ups and downs but the best times and glory remain up there very high!!!!
When I close my eyes and listen to Jurgen all I can see is the Terminator
Vielen Dank für den hochmodernen Fußball ❤
Forever in our heart❤
devastated :(
Jürgen Klopp thnx, Xabi Alonso will be next!
Jürgen Klopp is a fantastic coach and he seems to be a fantastic person too. Best of luck to him in the future!
I am glad he looks after himself as much as he looks after the club.
Go on Kloppo!  Der Junge aus dem Schwarzwald
Love Klopp Heja BVB and Liverpool
He is coaching club deportivo cruz azul from México 🇲🇽 😊
We re growing soft - also may have some psychological thing about it !?
I'm United fan however I am glad that all Premier League fans ( my self included) have that privilege to have you . Best of luck .
Have always loved his coaching and him as a person, I have a feeling he has had a scare some how.
One of the best trainers and a very straight guy with intelligence and idealism the same time which counts for me more than his talent in our dark out of ethics days.Good luck mister Klopp und servus  so ...
Gonna miss this guy in the Prem.  Love his outlook and his attitude and his down to earth approach to life in general.  Good Luck for the future Jurgen!  Wonder what you could have done at Villa :)
To be honest he looks tired and gettin old, so he might feel a bit exhausted. I'm totally agree with him what he decide to do for the future.  Life is more important than anything.
Hala Madrid
❤️
В первый раз слышал его речь. Юрген - реально умный и очень РАЗУМНЫЙ менеджер и человек! Он произвел на меня огромное впечатление, и я его отлично понимаю. Это решение- здоровая и правильная рациональность нормального немца, которая позволяет избежать ненужных фрустраций лицемерия и обманов. Апплодирую и желаю ему счастья и интересного будущего!
Saya rasa anda mau menimba ilmu ke Towel buat mematangkan pengetahuan dan strategy sepakbolanya...Tpwel adalah pemimpin lokal prett yg terkenal dengan filosopi grasak grusuknya...mgkn abang klop tertarik..
Thank you for everything you legend, wherever you will be you'll never walk alone
My life is up when Liverpool & Klop were up and down when they were down! 😢
My love 😍
Great Man :-) Greets from Austria :-)
Fantastic Manager. Enjoy retirement and spend the best years with your family. Will be well missed Jurgen. Man U Fan
Premier League: 2019–20 FA Cup: 2021–22 Football League Cup/EFL Cup: 2021–22; FA Community Shield: 2022 UEFA Champions League: 2018–19 UEFA Super Cup: 2019 FIFA Club World Cup: 2019 UEFA Europa League runner-up: 2015–16
The best decision   ever as a family man.he deserves a normal life. This world is too greedy.
Welcome to Saudi Arabia baby 🎉🎉
Leaving on a high, as did Alex Ferguson. Watch the demise of Liverpool. Alex knew and left. Jurgen knows and wants out. Management in clubs from high up are only in it for the money. Great manager, and I don't blame him for leaving. Man U fan.
Hope he doesnt regret it ! He will be missed by everyone
😢
As a Rangers fan, I'll miss him just because I'm a football fan. What a character, what a manager!. He has been great for Liverpool, great for the premiership and just great for football.
The fact that he's so very much respected by so very many supporters of so very many different teams says it all. Can't blame a guy for knowing his limits and knowing when he needs a break either. He deserves it.
Als Hoffnungsträger geholt als König verabschiedet
Nach diesem genialen schachzug wird Liverpool in seiner letzten Saison komplett alles reissen, genial kloppo
I’m not even a soccer fan wow what a coach ima look into this guy man
He will win the WorldCup with Germany one day. Mark my words
excellent communication strategy by klopp
Not even close to a liverpool fan, but this news affects me. Sad day for the premier league
I'd like to see the Special One next
The whole stadium and Merseyside will be crying and in mourning when he hits the pitch for the very last time. It's gonna be emotional beyond words.
LIVERPOOL AND BVB FOR EVER . YOU NEVER WALK ALONE
As a Chelsea fan I can't help but admire how Klopp transformed Liverpool to a top team in the EPL and Europe in recent times. Wish him all the best in his future endeavors
Love sir
Alonso is coming
He is going to Barcelona next year😂
Thank you klopp
Itu pasti akan sangat sulit untuk Xabi Alonso dan Steven Gerrard✍️
Anyone else noticed in this video that he has Adidas on?
I understand that it's sad to lose a coach like that but you fans are lucky to have had him and to still have him until June. Just think that other teams (I support Juventus) envy you a coach like that and never have one.
He will always be dortmund and liverpool❤
it is impressive how long he stayed in this high pressure job and it is very nice that he shares it with everyone, it is good to stop when you notice your energy is decreasing not when it is empty.
Absolute legend. Thank you for everything Klopp. 😍😍
off you pop
Creo que está noticia aún me duele 😢😢😢
as an arsenal fan i believe him to be the goat
Hardly the messiah is he. Jeeze was absolutely no Fergie
And he said he is the normal one!  Sorry, for me, he is the(very) special one!
Sunderland fan here, this man is an absolute legend , I've always enjoyed seeing him on the touchline also being interviewed ,not forgetting the quality football he's had his teams playing . God only knows what the Liverpool fans will be feeling , but me personally, i will miss him being over here immensely .Good luck and all the best Jurgen 👏👏👏🙌
I can see Liverpool winning the league and doing it for klopp before he leaves will give them motivation
Soon Mo Salah will leave too
He's doing it for the best for Liverpool fc , that says it all about the guy , top man klopp !!
Imagine if Gerrard takes the job, Hahahhahahah
Der beste Trainer von diesem Planeten ❤❤❤❤❤.  Wir vermissen ihn bis heute,  sehr schmerzlich 🖤💛
not a liverpool fan but this will be a sad loss to football in general and more so for the prem league. jurgen is a top manager, taken liverpool so far while hes been there. gd luck to him in whatever he decides to do.
I’m an Arsenal fan and I absolutely adore him as a  human being and as a football fan. ⭐️Legend.
Klopp is top class.  Let's be honest football isn't what it was ten years ago.  Players don't want to listen to coaches.  And owners, boards, and fans don't care.  And that's the truth.
From a Brighton fan, absolute respect for Jűrgen, we all need a life and probably many managers regret not leading a normal life. Good luck mate.
9:50 fantastic
Man United fan here..Having Klopp always made Liverpool one of the biggest challenges of the season for us..and you think I would be happy thats hes leaving..not at all..its the challenge that makes those games exciting(will still be challenging no matter who ye get Alonso,Zerbi etc..)..but Klopp made them a monster over the last few years..and hes simply a top man..any football fan can plainly see that..enjoy the retirement Klopp,well deserved..did huge things for Mainz and Dortmund too..well part of me also thinks he'll manage Germany in the future..think that might be the only team left for him.
Lesson learned. Never buy from Benfica otherwise it’s money thrown away… flop players. Big money. Klopp is leaving because of Darwin. Spent a lot of money and zero outcome. Missed simple goals… a tragedy. Shame of the guys who brought that flop.
Darwin’s effect
You'll never walk alone ❤
There was a break in this video at 19:15 when he was asked about getting the freedom of the city - his facial expression changed and the video cut, i think he broke down there.
Cant believe im typing this as a Chelsea fan... Respect. Respect to Klopp who turned Anfield into a scary place and Liverpool into a powerhouse. He should go down as one of the all time greats.
Hearing him say he will leave at the end of the season gives me goosebumps in a bad way
YNWA ❤️
I admire this guy so much it's crazy, he's so bright and human I love him thanks for everything, Jürgen
Off th saudi 🤑💰🤑
as a united fan, i got mixed feelings hearing him leaving liverpool, i'm glad that he wont be terrorizing my team anymore but at the same time i felt the loss of presence of such a big personality, you literally just cant hate the guy, wish him all the best for his future endeavors, definitely a massive loss for the premier league and he'll be missed..
As an Arsenal fan, I have the upmost respect for Klopp, what a manager, what a man, true legend right there.
Oh man i hope he will become the new DFB Bundestrainer, anytime :P..
I love this Man
Jürgen, my deepest respect for your honesty.
From this Aussie AFL fan whose father is a massive Liverpool supporter, sending much respect to this legend of a man for all he’s done for this club, for the fantastic code of Association Football, and for sport as a whole.  🫡 Jürgen, hats off to you sir, and all the best. YNWA  “Let’s squeeze everything out of this season and have another thing to smile about when we look back in the future.” Proud Scousers, you’ve heard the man. You already know what to do.
Klopp. You gave me the best memories. Cold covid nights. Winning the league. Hot summer finals 😢❤
I feel really bad within this very man made me fall in love with Liverpool and for no reason I’ve never stopped supporting Liverpool since 2015 I started I wish him all the best in his next adventure and also pray and wish the next manager for Liverpool be good as him why not even better than him 🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲🇨🇲
This is heart breaking for Liverpool fans. Obviously I totally respect Jurgen's reasons, but I guess all good things have to come to an end. As a lifelong Liverpool fan myself, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Jurgen for all that he's done for Liverpool FC. Whoever takes his place, it has to be a real pedigree manager because that is the standard Jurgen has set. I truly wish Jurgen all the best. Jurgen will be forever missed at Anfield!
Klopp is the best example of someone living in the moment and being present. He feels like he has reached all of his potential and he’s content. You can tell that he feels deeply for the club and the fans and this is why he is giving such an extensive interview. Everyone can learn a lot from Klopp. ❤
The normal one. Thank you for everything you gave and will. Respect from Arsenal fan.
Running out of energy ? bahahahhaha
Klopp to Orlando City confirmed
come to Bayern pls
Fair enough gaffer. You’ve spent so much time and life in football now it’s time for you to find what is missing in your life which is ‘life’ as what you’ve said. It’s time for us to cherish for you now and always remember You’ll Never Walk Alone.
Ohne Kolp kann man Liverpool nicht sehen
we always love you.
Komm nach Deutschland :)
lol Jürgen is really good at everything, even in club leaving. Wish you best days!!! Love and Recpect!
It is clear to see, he's given everything to Liverpool club at 200 mph, he does need a rest to see the finer things in life. He deserves this and it's the correct decision he will return again when Liverpool fall
Class act this guy. Can't do anything but respest Jürgen
Heart ❤️❤️ broken
Non Liverpool fan here, what a fucking beautiful amazing soul, top man, gone on the Scousers, end it well now 🙏
나는 클롭감독을 충분히 이해할 것 같다. 그는 지난 9년을 그저 앞만보고 달렸다. 다른것은 생각하지 않았지. 오로지 승리만을 위한 시간이였다. 자신이 태어나고 자란 또 선수로 감독으로 활동했던 독일이 아닌 영국에서의 결코 짧지 않았던 시간. 클롭 감독은 지금 정말 오롯이 자신만을 위한 휴식이 필요한거야. 그러기에 리버풀을 위해 마지막으로 최선을 다하고 싶은거야. 이건 그의 마지막 선물인거고. 우리는 클롭감독의 사임을 정중히 존중해 주어야 한다. 클롭감독! 당신은 영원히 우리의 영웅으로 남을겁니다. 웅장한 존경심을 보냅니다. 당신의 영원한 펜이 독일에서...!
To be committed  for what he has done fir the cluv
B cuz...no hurt  feelings for liverpool fans..sorry  u guys lag of committed  owner. .
Best manager in the world ❤❤❤❤
Danke Jürgen! The BOSS!
What a legend. His charisma and results ... unreplaceble. LFC is in serious troubles now ... who is going to fight cheating ManC?
As aliverpool fan I salute u thank u
Glasgow rangers fan but   have alot of respect for klopp for what hes done for Liverpool and the pl
❤
Well i feel lost, maybe i was toooooooo comfortable 🙏🏽thank kloop it happened before am Dead...
This man is greatness...pure greatness. He wouldn't agree but this makes him even greater.
You Will Never Walk Alone ❤❤❤❤❤
I wish you all the best  for the future
My bos😢
As a Liverpool fan, I'm devastated... but also being German there may be a silver lining: World Cup 2026. He can't stay away from football and coaching a national side is probably not as demanding... just a thought.
He made me love Liverpool!He brought Dominik Szoboszlai to Liverpool…absolutely the worst nightmare of Pep. I am heartbroken seeing him leaving but I understand pro football and all the challenges that come with it. Thank you Mister! All the Best!
About 20 years ago, to be honest, I loved the football team because of the Beatles.  And just like that I love this team.  It wasn't until Klopp arrived that I really felt like I was part of the team.  Thank you for the energy you and the team have transmitted to me.  As you said "we are Liverpool".  Wish all good things. I love you, man.
It feels like I'm loosing a member of my family 😢
Love JK. But what a whole lot of blablabla and repetitions and 100 per cents and clearlies.
Thank-you jurgen for everything you have done  may i wish you and your family everything you wish yourselves YNWA.
We couldn't say thank you enough to Jurgen Klopp as he did a lot for us. ❤
When other club fans cant believe he is leaving liverpool, you know he is a highly regarded and respected manager.  The PL will lose a legend  - chelsea fan
Please choose Hansi" Flick
He changed Liverpool he will be a legend for the club 😢
😢😢😢😢😢
The fact he chose to do this interview shows how much respect he has for this club❤
THANK YOU MR. J. KLOPP......... THANK YOU.....
In a nutshell, the man wants to take a break. He needs rest.
I am a Dortmund-Fan and I can image how Liverpool-Fans are feeling right now. I will never forget the moment he told us that he would leave Dortmund. From expierence I can only tell every Liverpool-Fan: Cherish this moment and and the time you still have with Jürgen on the sideline. Most importantly: cherish every memory Jürgen helped to create at Liverpool FC. They will stay with you forever. The hardest part will be having a new manager at the sideline next season because it does not matter who it will be, he will never be like Jürgen. It will get easier with time but you will always compare everyone with Jürgen for a very long time. YNWA
Once a red always a red ❤
He had big shoes to fill being whats Liverpools history is. He's leaving behind a pair of wellington boots to fill. Good luck to him
Who's cutting onions here
So why did klopp renewed his contract till 2026. This means there is an internal issue going on in the club. Klopp i know will not say this to kill the spirit of some players BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PLAYERS WHO CHOSE LIVERPOOL BECAUSE OF KLOPP.
ผมรักคุณพ่อคล็อปมาก….อยากบอกให้รู้ผมร้องให้เลยเมื่อได้ยินข่าว แต่ผมต้องเคารพการตัดสินใจของคุณ ขอบคุณที่มอบความสุขให้ผมตลอดเวลาที่ผ่านมา ตั้งแต่เชียร์ลิเวอร์พูลเริ่มต้นหลังยุครุ่งเรืองผมไม่เคยได้สัมผัสความยิ่งใหญ่ของสโมสรเลยจนอายุเกือบ40ปี….จนคุณพ่อคล็อปเข้ามา ทำให้ผมเข้าใจความรู้สึกในยุค80sว่ามันเป็นยังงัย ขอให้พ่อคล็อปจงมีแต่ความสุขในทางที่เลือกเดินต่อไป…ผมรักคุณสุดหัวใจครับ….Liverpool Thailand FC.
Massive respect to this leader.
A great manager, but also a great human being. Danke, und viel Glück Jürgen für die Zukunft. YNWA
Please dont go😪
how devastating news for us but i appreciate your decision sir wish you the best for your future
I can see pep crying
When Liverpool meets thier psych friend and conquer the world together, love it ❤
Es muy triste que Jürgen Klopp se vaya del Liverpool 😢
On Behalf of 500 million Liverpool supporters,  Thank you Jürgen Norbert Klopp   Please come visit us often. Stand in the Kop with us. We support and respect your decission. And you will never walk alone.
When I heard this news Absolutely Devastated I Honestly Couldn’t believe it but At any of day Have To Respect his Decision Thank You For Everything Jurgen Klopp you Done for our Legendary Club You are Soo Thoughtful and Genuine and Funny Guy also you will be remembered for your Passion and Dedication Thank You for All The Memories and Mad Times We Will Cherished Them Forever You Will Always be Truely Missed and Never Forgotten Enjoy Retirement Your Legacy Will go down in History Klopp You will always Be in Our Heart and Soul YNWA ❤️💯
As tottneham fan, klopp is love you so much.❤
I can already see kostas, mo and trent crying at the end if the season
You'll Never Walk Alone .. Gracias Klopp .. Ur always in our ❤ ..
He's doing a Pep. Go quiet for a year, go manage Bayern.
Klopp bvb waiting?)
Brilliant Manager, I hope he does well at Real Madrid when he joins next summer.
Seems like a nice guy in interviews, but can be disruptive and offensive to officials during games. He gets too excited.
Next  for Klopp, managing Germany.
An incredible human being...🇿🇦
Very smart strategy from klopp...Liverpool will not struggle next season because of a new manager and new style of play, rather new manager will be appointed early enough to learn everything bout the players the team and the way of play.
Will he leave his career or will he just leave Liverpool? Xavi will also leave Barcelona at the end of the season because he didn't quit coaching Barcelona. I'm not from Barcelona, ​​I'm from Madrid but I want to see good classics and Barcelona needs new signings and a new coach. We understand that the majority are loyal to Barcelona and want to finish their careers there but we need younger players with more potential. I think the signing of the season would be mbappe but. Come to Barcelona you are welcome
justice for Klopp like
Dear Jürgen, you did it. You managed to give us hope again. You managed to make us believe in something again.  You sacrificed your heart and soul to get this club back where it belongs. But you have created far more. You have created a feeling, an identity that is rarely seen in football today. It was felt that you were completely committed to this club with every cell in your body and that means more than any title that Manchester City has ever achieved or will achieve. You said it doesn't matter what people think about you when you come, but when you go. Well, you leave behind a legacy, an era full of great emotions, incredible comebacks and tragic final defeats, but above all, beautiful Anfield moments that couldn't have been more magical. You are the one who pushed our players to the extreme. You are the mentor who taught us to win again. You are the Savior who brought home the long-awaited championship for us. Thank you for being with us, we will miss you. Thank you Jürgen
As dedicaed, long term(over 25years) supporter of Manchester United, I'm shocked. I respect Jurgen since bvb. Liverpool lost truly a legendary manager. Premier league lost one of its posterchilds. I always respected lfc for history, for rivalries with manu. I don't consider man city as a opponent. Its just oil pumped club. But lfc is history. And Jurgen made one. I wish this guy wins over man city this season. Next season I wish good old rivalry between red clubs in England. Good luck lads. Ynwa.  Best wishes Man United fan.
🥲🥲🥲🥲
You kept your promise on where you where going to take us and we couldn’t be any happier. Thank you for all your done. I wish you the best and the rest of the time at Liverpool and future. 😢🎉❤ Thank you.🙏
As strong and long-life "Red" supporten... I can't discribe how much SAD & UNHAPPY I am, by listening this TITAN says to us "Goodbye"!!! But, I'm truly, really UNDERSTANDING Klopp the HUMAN! He's human, like all of us, he's not... "Robocop", he's not a cyborg to simply change an energy cartridge and to be "Ok" and go on. I know, because I found MYSELF in his place too many times, when I had to say "NO MORE, I HAD ENOUGH - I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE, I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE, I WANT A BRAKE!"...  I can't figure out WHO would an equal replacement for this TITAN. It's not, actually, about his manager's skills. Hell, we can find someone with his skill, I'm sure. THE PROBLEM IS... how we will be able to find someone WITH HIS QUALITY AS MAN, AS CHARACTER? That's the super major problem! Klopp is not "JUST" a great football manager, he's a GREAT MAN! The bond he has with the club... the supporters... the players... the stuff... the ENTIRE CITY of Liverpool... that's so UNIQUE, so PURE, that I can't figure WHO ELSE can be THAT MUCH PERFECT "MATCH" for us!!!  I truly believe, the retirement of Klopp is EQUAL SO UNIQUE & SOCK like... Bill Shankly... or Bob Paisley... was back then in their era! Yes, I know, Liverpool had many GREAT managers... but to me, if I want to pick Liverpool's "Holy Triangle"... that's BILL, BOB & JUNGER, period!!!  Oh boy... At least... let's hope STEVIE G will be onboard, in next June! I would be A BIT less sad, when Klopp farewell us...
Die ganze Welt weiß zu schätzen was der Klop in seiner Karriere erreicht hat nur die Deutschen nicht wie immer.  Einer der besten Trainer aber was noch besser ist was für ein Mann.  Ich als Bayern und Liverpool Fan 😢. Bitte eine Statue in Liverpool das hat er verdient. 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
You can tell he doesn't want to, but everyone knows how much sacrifice he's made... alot of people say to "how much is he getting paid?" but the thing is, you have to justify your position, and he did it above and beyond, IMO
Much love you Jürgen ❤ Thanks for everything, let's enjoy until end of the season ❤
❤❤❤
Kloop getmə liverpool dan  mən liverpool fanı olaraq deyirəm getmə liverpoolda qal 🇦🇿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇩🇪barcaya getmə biz sənə gorə aglayırı səni cox sevirəm jurgen kloop❤❤
I think he heard there was an opening as manager of Sweden
Very touchy feely. Great one for the softies. Not sure what Shankly would have made of it.
I can't believe how nobody has seen through this attention seeking stunt. Please please beg me to stay. He is full of kr@p. Why announce now and not at end of season?
당신은 리버풀의 구원자 였습니다 당신의 떠나기 전까지 우리 리버풀은 당신과 응원하고 콥들과 선수들과 승리의 트로피를 들어올리고 즐기며 완벽한 시즌을 보내고 싶습니다 고맙고 또 그리울것 입니다 고마웠습니다 클롭  (Thank you very much Klopp) (we're family we're Liverpool ) (You Never Walk Alone )
Thank you kloppy ❤. What a great role model and ambassador for Liverpool and football. We'll see you in a year when you get back from your hiatus 😂
4 trophies in 9 years pmsl this guy couldn't lace Ferguson's boots 😂😂
Honest, open, clear message. Although it's not what we wanted to hear, he's human, he's obviously drained and more than deserves a break. I hope the team puts in the extra 5-10%, to make this season a successful one and send off our manager in the best possible way. Even if it's still early, and there will be more appropriate moments, I'd like to thank you, Jurgen, for the wonderful memories and these past 8 years. You'll Never Walk Alone!
For me Diego Simeone is the right choice to replace Klopp.
As a Dortmund fan, I can kind of empathise with how that feels.  And I hope you don't end up like we did for years.  As the football magazine "11 Freunde" put it, a club with lovesickness...
Goat.
He's the best manager forever ⚽
Another victim of post-pandemic depression... 😢
Took me a day to watch this video, it was too hard for me to go through this. Thank you Jurgen for all the memories. Watching Liverpool play brought me joy during an especially tough part of my life, and Jurgen made me proud to call myself a Liverpool supporter. Every season under him brought so many memorable moments, from the moment he walked through the door, things started changing for the better. Eternally grateful Kloppo <3
We accept the decision, Jürgen. No one has earned the right to take care of themselves for a change as much as you have. All our love is forever yours. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
A true Liverpool Legend. Will always miss you
He already knows he's lifting the Premier League damn us Arsenal fans. Next season again 😑😑😑
I hope this is just a prank....
YNWA Klopp ❤️❤️😎
Kickoff echoes, fans alight, Loyal hearts in red ignite. On the pitch, a dance, a fight, Passion roars, a thrilling sight.  Jurgen's vision, bold and bright, Echoes through Anfield's might. Victory's scent, so close in flight, Every moment, pure delight.  In Klopp's realm, dreams take flight, Passion burns with all its might. Football's tale, woven tight, In this sacred, hallowed rite, of football  Dankeschön Jurgen!!!
What a legend. Good man
Wonder what he will do and where he will go after the season?
Worlds best manager!!!
farewell legend
Shock, Sadness, Understanding, Gratitude.......Went through a mess of emotions watching this interview.  As a Liverpool fan who went through the drought of losing seasons, Klopp brought hope to all Reds fans from his first interview as the normal one. The last few years were scintillating, exciting and dynamic for all who watched. Patience was finally rewarded with the ONE in 2020 which meant so much to so many.  Although i didn't get to watch the team at Anfield, i was thankful that i was able to make the trip to Singapore to watch the friendlies in 2023. Those matches now take on a whole new meaning.  Thank you Jurgen for giving your all the club.! No one could ask for more. Once a Red, Always a Red...
Please take off this video...I had enough of depression watching this video..😢
🏅You'll never walk alone.⚽🎁❤  🏅You will always be on my mind.🤜🤛✊  🏅You are a legend.🧔🥇💯
As a United fan myself I feel also sad, this man has entertained not by just winning but his character on and off the pitch was just impeccable. His brilliance from the team he had from the beginning to the team he had at the end just shows the level of  knowledge and understanding he had to transform a team to champions. I can say Sir Alex is the greatest but Klopp is right up there. To turn nothing into something very special managers can do that. Thank you Klopp
The only thing I don’t like about the interview is that Kloop looks like he is all alone. The interviewer should have sat next to him rather than behind the cameras.
We Will miss you❤️❤️❤️❤️
Burnout is normal. Take a rest and comeback after a year of two. You will be missed
Youll. Never. Ever. Walk. Alone.
gg
😭😭😭😭😭😭
make the statue for this man he bring us back to respectable even the best at some point. he not special he is the choosen one
YNWA
Klopp will forever be a Reds. You'll be missed legend, and You'll Never Walk Alone❤
Real Madrid bound!!!!!!
What a MAN! LEGEND!
he left liverpool??? noooooooooooo
GMOAT ❤️ Klopp Greatest Manager Of All Times
Thank you Jurgen! You helped me through one of the most difficult and stressful time of my life ❤️❤️
Thank you for everything you did , YNWA
Danke Jurgen. YNWA ❤
Spurs fan here, He deserves a rest, he's done so much for your club.
Thank you Legend 😢🙏🏽 YNWA❤
So, he is running out of energy mentally not physically
Jurgen ❤
I love Jurgen kloop you are the best manger of lieverpool
You will never walk alone.
Thanks Boss, for everything! YNWA!
Im from Canada, watching the EPL has been so exciting & fun over the years and Klopp is a brilliant Manager and seems like such a genuine, wonderful person.. Wishing him all the best!
کیرت دهن کل لیگ برتر
Always liked this man since he was manager of Mainz in the second national league in Germany!Pure class 🫶👊
sebagai fans man city saya harap liverpool still boleh jadi title contender untuk 5 tahun seterusnyaa..rindu la nnti klopp vs pep
Respect. Grateful being in part of Klopp’s era.
Where ever you are. You are the Kop. Jurgen.
I think Klopp might go to Barcelona after Xavi announced him leaving a day later
Big Liverpool fan here…I am saddened but respect this decision. As a former professional ballet dancer there comes that time… What a strikingly honest and self aware man. A great leader! Best wishes to you, Jürgen, and thank you for all you have given to this club. You will never walk alone. Liverpool always!❤💐
Danke Kloppo 🙏🏻
My heart is shattered into pieces, three days after the announcement and I still can't believe this is really happening and Klopp is leaving. I've never and I will never love a manager like Jurgen, not even the football side and the tactics and stuff, but Klopp the person, the charisma and the character, how he's connected to the fans, how he talks about football, how he motivates his players and the fans, he's so unique and so special. Life will move on and different managers will manage Liverpool in the future, but no one will ever be like Jurgen, thanks for everything, thanks for the memories, for every trophy you won with us, and finally thanks for changing our lives. Thank you ❤❤
❤️
KLOPP DONT ONLY BREAKING LIVERPOOL HEART HE'S BREAKING EVEN OTHER CLUBS SUPPORTERS 💔 HEART KOPP IS SUCH AN AMAZING COACH AND A GREAT MAN
Every LFC fan may be upset by this news, but we all wish our Boss the best of health. YNWA
ITS A SHAME  AND RESPECT FOR YOR DECISION MISTER JURGEN
Thanks for the everything sir
Klopp is a man of values, an honest man. Rare to find nowdays. How can you not like a man like him.  I am an acmilan fan,  and seeing him go makes me sad.  I am 55, i am realizing that man with values are going away, they don't believe anymore in this fake  system. I don't belong in this world we created, unfortunately  i have to keep going.....but there are some days, they happen more often lately,  where i just dont wanna be part of this World,  there are days, i feel ashamed of being a human !!!
I am a Milan fan. I have a lot of respect for this man. Not many people would let go a job of  8M a year the way this man is. Klopp did not chose  money in this case,  $$  isn't as important as life values. A man that chooses values and honesty over millions euros, has a lot of respect from me ! You will be missed !! Ac.milan fan
Because noone will sack him, he has to sack himself 😭😭😭😭😭
I'm so glad that Jurgen is a red 🔴❤

God Speed Sir!! thank you so much for being the "Normal One" and for bringing the sunshine back to Anfield!! Love, Respect!!!!
Am a Chelsea fan, my all time favourite video about Jurgen is the one he said 'I BELIEVE IN GOD' the rest is history ❤
Welcome to Saudi Arabia ❤
I honestly think but hope not that hes unwell. Gonna be a tough few months regardless 😢
Thank you boss. For everything ❤ And if this life gives an opportunity I would love to have a beer with you, reminiscing over the beautiful memories during your reign. I don't think I will see such a genuine human being and a charisma ever again during this lifetime. What an honor has been to see my club thriving under your guidance. YNWA ❤
That day has come eh(( i need time to recognize liverpool without that man
I heard it loud and clear Mr Klopp.
Thank you sir, for absolutely everything!!!! What an unforgettable and exciting journey it has been. You gave us a Premier league title. As a lifelong Liverpool fan I cannot thank you enough. All the very best for the future!!
KDB returns so Klopp leaves! 😅 😊
After watching this video, I feel he is just not a manager but a beautiful person and very honest. I will miss you and your beautiful smile and life lessons which you give! All the best, Klopp!
Build a statue in his honour
❤LIVERKLOPP❤
Is he been lured by Barca? Xhavi also announced departure?
What a legend
The End of an era,,,things really do fall apart

I don't think you'll ever understand how much you've done for not just Liverpool but myself as well. Your what every human should look up to being. I'm 16 and can see what a legend you are to the society of Liverpool and for the legacy of the club. Your spirit will live on in all of us. Thank you jurgen. To a normal legend.
You can recognise a honest, open thoughtful, sincere person instantly. There aren’t many more so than Jurgen Klopp. Respect.
Jurgen Klopp in this Interview shows why he is the man he is, what he has brought out of the people he works with! His exemplary record is because he is how is in this interview. Good at showing emotion, expressing this eloquently. He Is a legend, he always will be. We who are fans @ LFC have been lucky to have this guy as our manager. Premier League is privileged to have a master at the helm of a massive club.. A great advert for the Premier League as a whole. The passion I've witnessed is rare! His ability to bring all the fans together is rare indeed. See Goal Celebrations and End of match Punching the air moments and you understand. Trophies, atmosphere, commanding the pitch. It Start with this Guy. Jurgen you are a blessing to us.  A once in a lifetime manager! Good luck in whatever you do.  You will be missed. Forever a fan D.W Norwich, Norfolk, UK 🇬🇧
He,ll be Barcelona new manager .
The Premier League will miss this man....let alone the Reds. Klopp in the Kop! Won't ever forget the magical night Liverpool destroyed Barca 4-0 at Anfield
YNWA ❤
I Love the Lfc, but had to admit...its because of 2005 and "now" mainly Juergen.  Even for us Germans, and I think I speak of 99% of us, Juergen is a special human being. It's not the "german" thung....he's a special person, born to do jobs like this. He's inspiring me, clearly, respectfully, honestly, loyal...what else would you could be? This man is an inspiration to all of us, I clearly understand the fact that he has success, no matter what country, place or time... good luck Juergen, for whatever you would like in the future! Special human beeing. nothing more to say...
We are not ready for this we will miss these world will be depressed we will miss you klöpp   Thank you all time for livepool❤
Am chelsea fan but I love you and have a great respect 🙌 💯 for you brother because you are special you are really amazing ooh my God 🙏 imagine premier league without you 😢😢ooh no, I wish you all the best ✌️

The end of a era

Would rather divorce the wife than klopp leave
Legend.❤️
Absolutely thankful with he has done for Liverpool and premier league football. We wish Klopp and his family the very best for the future. ❤❤❤
I’m just a normal guy, I just don’t live a normal life for too long now. Bless you gaffer, as long as your are happy! ❤
My gaffer ❤️❤️❤️ LIVERPOOL through and through. Brought us back to our best n we will never play better football then we did with this man or be able to replace this German diamond ❤️
The only reason I still watch football and Liverpool games  specifically is Kloop. Their team spirit and Anfield is what every child grows on or what every elder reminisces.
Sir Klopp, we love you!!!
So much respect for his self awareness and wanting the best for the club’s future. How incredibly honest and humble. What a man, will be missed but will always be one of us. You’ll never walk alone! Now let’s keep going and give you the final season you deserve!💪🏼
😭😭

We will miss you. YNWA
Thank you for your service ❤ you'll always be missed ynwa
No I'm not crying 😭 you are crying, love klopp, a father figure I never met. The legend embraced the history of Liverpool team and the people
As BVB and LIV fans, LIV from born and BVB from you. Thanks for everythings boss.  " The K(l)op(p) " ❤
If u think is time for a rest why not....everyone deserves their own time in life...working is just part of it ...enjoy ur life with family is something important to u I mean everyone....come to visit China u will love it
I'm from Ghana and my blood is Liverpool. I have never been to the city or Anfield before but I love the club massively. To Jurgen: out of love I really respect your decision to leave the club at the end of the season. But, sincerely, I have not been myself ever since you made the announcement. I'm finding it difficult to even eat.  We love you Jurgen!  You'll Never Walk Alone!
I Will miss you klopp, i want you and liverpool won the premier and the europe league, the end of on of the Best moments in the club, we are Will miss you..
He has won the most important trophy a manager could get, and is the heart of the fans, nationally and internationally, with Liverpool, he will always be in our hearts
내 생애 최고의 시기였습니다 2015~2024 // 감사했습니다 클롭풀 편히 쉬세요 보스 🙏🙏
It will be the biggest wake in the city since John Lennon was shot
You'll never walk alone Klopp. We'll be forever grateful.
Jika kita mendengar Nama JURGEN KLOPP.. Kita langsung teringat nama LIVERPOOL.. bukan Dortmund atau Mainz..
Bottle job 😂
Scary ankles them.. He's ill
Why thought
Ooh😓😓 we the Liverpool  fans will miss having you in the club but I understand you and and were you're coming from but you'll  be greatly missed and you'll still remain our man😭😭❤️❤️❤️ Liverpool for life ❤️🙏
Not a liverpool fan, but the passion he brought to the game was just brilliant. A great manager who trusted the youth, bought up and coming young players and made them superstars, and even made one former premier league flop into a legend of the game. His signature fist pumps will be missed
🫡Top Manager, huge loss for LFC (from Ac Milan fan)
I am Barcelona fun. But I'm crying! 😢😢😢 I haven't cryed so much even when Messi out.  I adore their football-chess-duels with Pep Guardiola. EPL lost one of the best football grandmaster!!!  Klopp is legend! 👏👏👏
🥺🤍
Absolutely devastating news :(
Greatest manager to ever grace the beautiful game! YNWA ❤❤❤
I thought he is making his mega statue as a legend in the city of liverpool.. but i was wrong, just it,, thank you mr. klopp ❤

شكراً يورغن
Klopp deserves  a statue in LFC. I understand my Guy. Sometimes in life u have to slow down n take ur self outside of your self to see what the meaning is…….
From Utd supporter this was sad to watch. Man gave all his heart, love and dedication to the club. He will be missed in the Premier League massively
😢😢😢
We love you klopp❤
He gave utd some of the worst embaressing beatings ever. Top manager he Will be missed in the league im a utd man btw respect to him.
Best manager
As an united and Madrid fan we will miss kloop in premier league. 😢
Fuerza
I wish you all the Best to One of the Greatest Managers Ever! We will miss you You ❤!😢
As a Liverpool fan this is a tough divorce to take!
I know we all agree that Klopp was one of the best managers Liverpool had from the past to the future now he made the team and to be honest 50% of Liverpool's wins the other 50 are the players I think Liverpool deserves to win the fa cup premier league  Europa league and caribou cup we are so close continue this Liverpool :) "(
As a city fan Jurgen klopp is a legend and after watching this rivalry aside I will miss him as a football fan
It's heartbreaking, but more importantly, I hope for his happiness.
I’m not a Liverpool fan, but this man has brought me so much joy in the way his team plays, and the countless comeback wins. I’ll always have respect for the man he is. Hope he gets a good rest in, and then come back to football at some capacity. We will miss you! A true legend.  Danke Jürgen!
I started following Liverpool when Robbie Fowler was still playing until now.. hearing the news that Jurgen Kloop was leaving Liverpool at the end of this season.. it really destroyed me and I even couldn't eat until now.. but everything is fate and you, Jurgen Kloop, never walk alone. . thank you very much you deserve the best
From Utd supporter this was sad to watch. Man gave all his heart, love and dedication to the club. He will be missed in the Premier League massively
A perfect man.
👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😥😥
Amazing person. Awesome. One of the greatest,warmest person. Wisdom. Thank you.
Thank You, Jürgen Klopp
Such professionalism
The best manager in the history of Liverpool🔴♥️ Thank you for everything Jürgen♥️♥️ And let’s win the quadruple for Klopp🔴🔴 YNWA Jürgen♥️♥️♥️
Ur leaving really have made my heart break into pieces!   I'm a 36 years old man and i cried like a 8 years old boy
Maybe Liverpool is the only club that makes such decisions necessary for a person - now it's up to all of us to accept it with the same heart💞
Yoy sign the  contact to 2026 comeon.Tell us what wrong with you. This is so sad This is not fair.
❤❤❤
언어는 통하지않지만 , 마음을 울리는 남자 위르겐클롭  앞으로 하시는 모든일이 잘되시길 .
More than family. You need help if that's true. But he's honest and decent. I hope he enjoys a break and comes back if he wants to. I'm a toon fan x
Won 1 league title and you lot call him a legend 😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you Herr Klopp
I miss you Jurgen Klopp to Head Coach for The greatest of champions league and super cup trophy and world cup club and more thank you to Jurgen Klopp. Congratulations  I going crying 😢

YESSSSSSS Finally He will manage FC Barcelona
We love u klop ,you r great here at anfield.God the rest of life and your family and friends.thnks
💛 👏🏻
Thank you Sir (a double reason for me), for all the time you spent at Liverpool🥰 , and also for making BvB what BvB was at that time !!! 🤗
Absolutely love the energy and enthusiasm in your videos. Your passion shines through, making it a joy to watch. Looking forward to more content from you!
Respect for your future.we all need time out every now and then. Most of us get caught up in work and forget about our own lives, our family life. Time waits on no one. Taking time out will make you a much better and happier person. Only then can you start over. Being a manager takes up all your time.  I'm not a Liverpool fan, but what I do know is that hands down, he is the best manager.
LOLLLL
As a real Madrid fan.I cried a lot . Without you Liverpool is nothing 😢😢😭Thank you for everything 😐🥲
Who cares get real
What a nice person with all he's saying.  He should be the trainer of our national team Germany later when he is again in the mood for it.
The day has come😢
.
This takes a huge amount of bravery and loyalty towards the club you love!  What a guy!❤️
Shame he managed a small club that couldn't match his ability as a coach. Imagine if he managed a big club with the financial and infrastructure that supported him. No wonder he's burnt out
I hard to accept I feel like my wife just devoced me thank you so much Coach we love u so much
You'll never walk alone...🥺❤️🫡
This is so unbelievable. There is always time for everything. Jurgen has been Liverpool family. We shall miss you Jurgen
No Cry mens.......
After his break: Germany Coach, come back home please ❤
Finally
Best coach in the world
No worries, Jurgen Klopp, you have been.  exceptional at Liverpool. So, if you are reading this, you have honestly been a great manager for Liverpool. And have led Liverpool to great achievements.
Sorry Liverpool
Some times in life you crash and burn,...and you need time out
It hit as hard as it could. It feels like a close friend leaves for good. But I accept it. If you love someone, let him go. Jürgen will always remain in our hearts. Thank you!

Liverpool should just give him a year off with pay then come back
Kloop thank you Soo so much you will be missed
Kloop is lived ❤️😭
legend
Build the man a statue. He has single-handedly transformed the club.  YNWA
I’m “transgendering” into a Fräulein and will be first female premier league manager-person. My pronouns will be announced during my next press conference.  What’s offside?
He brought rock and roll back to football. Never a dull moment on his roller coaster ride.
Am a Liverpool fun but this news makes sad for every Liverpool funs respect our coach u will always be in our hearts but we trust in you God bless you dear
..... come home.
I’m not supporter of L’pool but I have enormus respect for your team and menager, I just hope that he is okay health wise, because he wouldn’t say that he isn’t. Also I belive this is a good moment to announce this because Liverpool is in race for 4 trophies, and this gonna be massive boost for the team and this can be something that can unite them till the end of season. I’m Arsenal fan and It doesn’t look like we are gonna be able to challenge for title but that we are gonna see later this season. I wish you guys to win trophies this season and say proper goodbye to your manager, even if you don’t Jurgen Kloop is gonna go in history as one of the greatest
My father died recently, and we shared the klopp ear together which brought light to our lives. I can say that I will miss Jürgen more than any other loss I’ve suffered.
Who’s replace Jurgen Klopp
This man gave 9 years to Liverpool FC, he brought us out of the dark and back into the light, I'm sure i talk on behalf of all Liverpool fans when I say that that Jurgen Klopp will go down in history as our greatest manager of all time. Thank you Klopp, good luck on your future ventures
Great and honest interview. What a legend Klopp has been. The biggest compliment I can give him is he is the one manager that all other fans would want for his football and personality and I am a Man United fan

I am a 52-year-old man sitting here with tears in my eyes, choking up. I knew it would happen one day, but this is heart breaking. Will always respect and love this man for what he is and what he has done for all if us.  It is obvious, but YNWA Klopp.   I still dream of meeting this man and receive one of those big hugs.
End of an era, we will never forget the rivalry of Klopp and Pep 🥹
Beni futbola sevdiren, her hafta Liverpool maçlarını izleten ve Liverpool ailesinden yapan adamfır Klopp. O giderse Liverpoolu bırakırım sanırım. Maçlarını izleyemem galiba😢😢 Hoşça kal Klopp. Bu sezon tüm kupaları alalım, hak ediyorsun bunu.
İf Klopp leaves I can't whatch matches of Liverpool😢
I love mr Kloop. I will always love mr Kloop. Kloop = Lfc!

Chelsea fan here…Jurgen Klopp, is one of the greatest managers in any sport that has ever graced our earth…I have the utmost respect for Liverpool, their fan base, and the goosebumps I get when you all put your hearts on your sleeves and sing YNWA…having this man as your leader was almost like you fans manifested him into existance…you deserved him, and he lead you to the promised land…I truly feel your pain, and I thank this man for adding to why the EPL is the greatest league in the world…Nothing last forever, but this man’s Legend status shall be forever engraved into the storied grounds of Anfield, and the hearts of Liverpool fans around the world…I finally understand what it means to Never Walk Alone…It’s just plain beautiful…

Thanks for the memories Jurgen. You’re a legend YNWA ❤
he wants to see what normal relaxing life is like for a while as gutting as it is if thats what he needs then i respect that. thanks for the memories ynwa
The greatest achievement that Jürgen has achieved is not the trophy and all the wins, but he conquered the heart of fans and even his rival with respect. What a man..
I wish i was dreaming..If i had something to do to make you stay i could have done it for you❤❤❤
Thank you Jurgen, for your dedication to our club, I was too young to remember Bill Shankly's retirement but I remember Bob Paisley and King Kenny's  retirements and they hurt.  Hearing that you are bringing your time with us to an end a the end of this season, it's a kick in the gut.  You gave us guts and you gave us heart, you made us the best club in the world and I will miss you.  YNWA Jurgen Klopp, love you dude,
You'll never walk alone. Thank you very much.. i am cry😢
California viewer here- when I was told by my co worker I did not believe him. In such distraught, you’ll never walk alone 🫶🏽
I hate this day 😞😫😫😫
Just watched the interview. It’s just hit me thinking and realising that we won’t have Klopp anymore.  I cried a couple of times, my emotions bottled up till now but I’m still going to believe in our team we carry on and there will be another Klopp in the future, we will still be successful.
Absolute lfc legend. Never bored of listening to him. Created so much energy on the field. Will leave the club in a fantastic place going forward. This is what fergie should have done. (Fergie left it too late and his team was already running out of steam). Wenger left it too late, too. Thanks Klopp. I’m gutted but eternally grateful. (Please don’t end up managing a greedy Spanish team.)
To me this feels like a family member has died. Painful and heartbreaking 💔  Thank you for what you did to Liverpool, from a laughing stock to a  dominant and feared team. Once you go red, you'll never go back. YWNA!!
And yes, build this man a statue
I don't want klopp to leave. I'm united fan but klopp made me love every club he's worked in. Thank you for making football special. Enjoy the next chapter of your life
heartbreaking news u have done almost everything for us YNWA klopp ❤
What a legend. Jurgen Klopp came and brought Liverpool back to the top and won many titles, a top manager who always has the respect of the team and fans. He deserves a statue. Well done Jurgen, I wish you the best in the future. Enjoy your break YNWA ❤
I believe we will see him on the bench for Germany at one point :O That will be tough for english Liverpool fans.
can anybody from England say Jurgen properly?
Goo Goo Gaa Gaa
❤
I am an old German Lady without any ambition for football. The whole Saturday I was listening the Interviews and Videos. Jürgen is such a wonderful Charakter, honest, Brave and cute. YNWA Hugs from the Black Forest and Stuttgart.
Imagine Jose Mourinho joining Liverpool
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤  Danke.....Klopp  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you for the years , my boss YNWA
There is a rumour that says he and Mo Salah are going to play in Saudi Arabia next season.
I know he said he is not retiring, but I don't mind if he retire from football.. I mean after 24 years in management and maybe 10+ years as players I could see how taxing it is to some people that maybe does not build for the high life, high pressure, and intense position like manager of LFC.   Whatever happen best of luck Jurgen, thank you for all of the happy memory for the last 9 years.. I am sad, but I am also relieved and happy for you..
Eigentlich müsste er niemanden über 20min um Verständnis bitten. Was Jürgen überhaupt für den Fussball gemacht hat ist unbezahlbar. Nimm dir alle Zeit der Welt! Familie, Gesundheit usw. ist so viel wichtiger als alles andere! Genieße deine Zeit! So entscheidet und beschließt ein richtiger Mann!!
🥺🥺 thank you for everything kloppo ❤️ YNWA

Thank you for the memories Mr Klopp Danke
I just can't believe this is happening 😢.  Klopp is Family 😭
He needs a rest before taking over Barcelona.
So sad ... Liverpool will survive and find a new way, but really sad, we'll miss him. He deserves to go with trophy, please win this fucking PL and europa league, I want the story to be like this.
Xabi Alonso Loading........................
Can’t believe it 😢 Best manager we had since Paisley days. 💯 Good luck Jurgen🤞 Thank you
🇺🇸 I am from America 🇺🇸 & I will always be in love with you, Jurgen, until I die♥️🥺♥️Thank u so much for all the great memories😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you for everything Jurgen Klopp. YNW.. ❤
Literally crying right now...
Never heard anything sadder than this 😢. I still believe with proper backing he'd stick around maybe longer . I can't hold back the tears anymore sincerely 😢
I'm Man U but this man made my like LFC. I'm glad he had such a great run in record time with this great club. Love this man. Best wishes Sir.
We Loved you... We still Love you.... WE will Love you... Forever.... YNWA Jurgen
It takes enormous self-awareness and courage to be able to say that one needs to walk away. It's not a surprise that perhaps Klopp is potentially facing burnout after years of being in such an extreme pressure job. The overall results at end of the 2022-23 season may have also contributed to his overall decision.   Whilst we are massively disappointed to lose him as the custodian of our beloved club, we should be thankful for all the success that he has guided the club towards.  The club is still in a highly competitive state and there will hopefully be more success for us to celebrate before the season is over.
Feels like if is not him someone really close to him might be sadly terminal. I remember a few weeks back when he lost his ring celebrating and spoke about losing weight rapidly. All the best Boss
I love you klop and I will miss you best of luck ❤️
❤❤❤YNWA Klopp
we love you klop but we need xabi alonso a this moment
Hate this club
I understand him doing same job over and over you do run out of energy. I believe he needs a long break from football than comeback with fresh energy. I hope some other English football club gets him after his long vacation from football because this man is very important for English premier league.
항상 에너지 넘치고 열정적인 축구 보여주셔서 감사합니다. 클롭감독님의 다음 행보를 응원합니다!! YNWA
A colossus of the game well respected by I would say ALL fans regardless of club in the Premier League. His honesty, integrity and his passion for the game and his club you can see at the end of games, who doesn’t love his fist pumping? That he’s pushed his rivals to the wire twice and lost the league by a single point would wear anyone down but not him, he dusted himself down and went again to bring one home! I think we’ll all miss him when he goes but until then I wish him well and hope he wins as many trophies as he can, good luck Jurgen from a City fan.
I will always miss you, you are my superhero. You'll never walk alone Klopp.
It's the biggest broken heart for me as a liverpool holic 😢
This is so sad😢 klopp is surely a legend❤
Kloop and Salah are Liverpool and we lose half of Liverpool in this season 😭
Thank you Klopp 🤧 we love you
😢😢😢😢
We'll never see a manager like him in our lifetime or ever again. I am so grateful but I will never get over this.
This situation on the kops be like when we have to know Sir. Alex leaves from Old Trafford. But i think in the end .this club will be great again after that because they're really passionate . I'm so jealously you all if you have the great coach . Respect from MUTD fan.
WELCOME TO FC BARCELONA
Great opening, interview, and ending. We support your decision and  thank you for all the sacrifices and work you put into this club Jurgen Klopp.  YNWA. Team Liverpool always and forever!  Now let's win the premiere league title one more time and go out with a bang for if not the best, one of the best coaches of all time!
Respect>
Painful 😢
Man i did not want to watch this but here I am 😢😢😢
⚽️🔥❤️🙌
Leave the stage while they are still clapping
My special football scientist
I don’t think any one can hate jurgun
Amazing
Thank you for everything you have done for this club. Forever a legend. You'll never walk alone.
Good luck Klop. Not a Liverpool fan,but you are respected by football fans regardless of club. Take care.
Thank you for everything  we miss you Klopp😢
As a Man city fan,Klopp is my 3 favourite manager av all time behind mourinho and pep
Hey Boss! we're not ready for this but Big Thanks for all you do for us , your Thailand fan.
I believe the next Liverpool manager will be Sporting CP coach Ruben Amorim, what's your thoughts?
He is just a family man.
Legend 👏🏼
I am hurt hearing this. Anyway, let’s win everything for him.
Very brave and sincere man…
Thank you Jűrgen thank you so so much YNWA.
this man mean a lot to my life
Absolutely Legend we will miss you
嫌だ！辞めないでくれ ペップとの激闘をまだ続けてくれ！
Mein Herr. Aufweidersen 😮😮😊
I knew that Klopp was meant for Liverpool. 😢😢😢. U can't leave us Manager 😢😢😢😢
Jesus, I'm bawling!!!  Jurgen you are a living legend. Thank you so much for the passion/knowledge  and getting this club back to where it belongs as it wasn't easy. I wish you all the best for the season and I think there are chapters left for sure, I would love to thank Ulla too. Great men have great wife's ( behind great men are amazing partners).  We will miss you Klopp's but we will all walk on together.  Thank you soo much and be well my friend. YNWA
ดูทั้งน้ำตา ขอบคุณอย่างสูง สำหรับทุกสิ่งที่ผ่านมา ที่ BOSS ได้ทุ่มเท เพื่อสโมสรของเรา  การตัดสินใจของ BOSS มันเป็นเรื่องยาก แต่เราควรต้องยอมรับมันให้ได้  ต่อจากนี้ไปเราจะไม่มี BOSS  มายืนว็ากข้างสนาม อีกแล้ว  เราควรใช้เวลาร่วมกัน อย่างมีความสุข ใช้เวลาที่เหลืออยู่ ให้เต็มที่ไปด้วยกัน  WE LOVE  BOSS JK.❤
Thank you, Jurgen. ❤ I'm happier it happened, than I'm sad it's ending. We've been blessed and he's earned his rest. In life you decide to start, stay or leave.
Yeah this made me cry... not an ideal start to my birthday.  Klopp is not only a top manager but he's a kind and genuine person, which is why this hurts even more.  I realized that when my nephews get older I'll be able to say that I got to witness the Klopp years.
I'm a fan of LFC since 1974. Really appreciate your decision  Wish You the best  Wish i could meet You in person.  Thanks for everything ❤❤❤❤
Let's hope Jurgen can take a hiatus and recharge his batteries. Come back in a couple of years refeshed.
Build the man a statue. He has single-handedly transformed the club.  YNWA
A humble,intelligent,charismatic human being who has graced our wonderful club he's up there with the rest of the Liverpool greatest managers. Jurgen Klopp we love you. YNWA ❤👌
Before you leave please give us another premier league title this season and you'll be remembered as legend ❤
Jurgen, Even LFC not welcome you, you are Liverpudlian forever
What Honesty,what a Man,Thank you Jurgen
Please , No hatred for this man, he strongly build  the sunken ship
What a special manager. ❤ Klopp turned me into a liverpool fan from a neutral football fan when they downed Barca. His personality is infectious and it makes me rooting for him and his team. I totally understand his concern though and after last season, I think he take a right decision. I hope this season will be a special one and Liverpool can winn all there is to play. Thank you, Mr. Klopp. You and liverpool are really match made in heaven, but all good time will end eventually. Wish you nad your family all the best. And I also wish LFC all the best going forward, replaceing Klopp will not be easy, but the team is good foundation. Here's hoping the next guy coming in can work on it and achieve even greater heights.
The sports car analogy really hit me. “Im the only one who sees the needle going down…”
Never been sadder in my life. Kloppo we love you more than you’ll ever know ❤️
Id rather my family left me than lose you Jürgen ❤ We love you so much
KAL LUL SUH,CHAM RIH RAWH KAN VANGKHUA AH
Complete man ❤❤❤ A legend forever ❤❤❤ YNWA🎉🎉🎉🎉
Liverpool will have no trophy again in the coming 20 years
I am crying rn😢 I’m so sad Klopp will leave after over 8 years of service with Liverpool, we will never forget him as a legend, but who’s ready for the next generation guys? Gerrard to Liverpool? Xabi Alonso To Liverpool?
Hard hitting😔... All the best wishes boss, and hope u find another club, that takes to u, like we took to u (will never be the same, but yea)...
One of the saddest days of my life, love you Kloppo, feel like the wind has been knocked out of me 😢 ynwa
This giving me Xabi Alonsi is coming soon vibes
YNWA 🔴⚪ Danke Klopp 👏
Jürgen is, and forever will be a scouser.  YNWA ❤
I’m jealous of Liverpool for having this kind of a manager for so long. What a top man 👏🏻
I still believe he will revise his decision 🥰
We Are Liverpool
Jurgen Klopp reminds me of Dr. House His work over the nine years was closer to healing an entire club and rehabilitating it over and over again
Iam so sad with your decision  and you still have  energy but it can't be physically.
Klopp come to United we are better than shitterpool and bring salah to united
Thank you Jürgen..
My gf of 7 years left me for a women... And this feels more painful.
I'm Not Crying, You're Crying
Please dont go...😢😢😢 Danke Shoun
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have loved you so far and I will continue to love you. Thank you Boss
Thank you for your contribution. It has been an absolute magical journey. I respect your decision.
im not even a liverpool fan and i am so extremely saddened
Herr Klopp, I have been a Liverpool supporter for almost 65 years, since I was the age of 5. I visited Anfield with my Dad who was in turn a massive supporter and although we lived in Dublin (Liverpool is a Parish) we went to many dozens of home games after travelling on the ferry from Dublin. When you arrived almost 9 years ago you said you wanted to make doubters into believers and that you would win a major trophy in 4 years! Well that 4 years turned into 5 minutes as the style and playing skills of the team blossomed under your coaching and I remember well how you turned despair into pride for me at least. I now live in Nelson, New Zealand and usually have to either get up at ungodly hours or stay awake to to support my team as best I can from here! It is no longer a chore but a joy to see how you have again revitalised the team since last year. You know, I cannot thank you enough for all the joy that you bring me! I am so very proud of what you have achieved on my behalf! If you are ever down this way you are welcome to share  my home! YNWA  Danke lieber Freund
Klopp you  Will surely be missed...devastating though😢😮
Saudi calling.........................................................................
😢😢😢 when he left?
He is leaving because City are cheating the system. City has billions.
Beautiful and honest
Thank you Klopp. YNWA
Beatles and Klopp. Love you!!
اخخ بس ياكلوب بتتركنا
We love you Boss
Kami tahu setiap pertemuan pasti ada perpisahan, tapi kami belum siap dengan perpisahan ini 😢
He is a very true, authentic person. Because you don't always have to do well in life. One can only see certain aspects of things lying on the ground.
One of the few men left with honor and values ​​in football. He has earned a long break after 24 years non-stop. From Spain, I hope to see him here one day on a team because he will always be one of the best coaches that has ever gone through this sport. An honor Mr. Klopp and Liverpool fans for what you have experienced with him.
Love you Jurgen <3 Youve earned it
Is it me or Klopp has really lost some weight?! I hope he's doing alright health wise an amazing manager and a gteat character, we will never be able to replace that charisma , heart and desire. Thank you Klopp 🎉 for the 8yrs  of pure fight and desire to win it all
sad, sad day.
And it was time to part ways, Liverpool didn't progress in the last season and apparently won't in this one either. The amount of money invested in the whole story and in the team does not allow the club to be in this position. Something had to be changed at the beginning of the season, but... We have to try with someone else in the position of manager, because it doesn't work like this anymore...!!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
danke jurgen 😭😭😭
Thank you for everything Jürgen ♥️ you brought us so much joy Now lets get our heads toward the future and the end of the season because we have to honor you the way you deserve !!
Klopp was the sole reason I started supporting Liverpool a few years ago. I had no epl team allegiance before. My fav manager of the lot.
Please don't leave. If he leave the club. Impact coming. Hope  the replaces coming is something we want
🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😢
If I was a betting man, i would say he was going to Real.
Oof. This stings, but this guy deserves anything he wants. Thank you Jurgen. You are and always will be Liverpool🫵 YNWA
Your best manager  from arsenal fans 🙏👍
I'm crying, we all are 😭
Thank Boss 😢 (from Indonesia)
YNWA
😢😢
God bless you Jurgen. So many memories you have given me and every liverpool fan around the world. I couldn't have hoped for a better manager than you. May you be happy in your future life away from the daily grind ❤ ynwa
Nooo jurgen😭😭
This past week been joyful but then this news came out. I donr even know how to process. So many questions in my head on why he made such a rush decision. Coz be honest, we need him in the club for many more years to come. But he made it already. All I could do now is say thank you, thank you and thank you to Klopp. He is such an amazing coach. He bring back Liverpool FC to the glory time and gave titles after titles. Lets give his last season at Anfield to the very best by giving the Premiere League Cup, FA Cup, Europa League Cup, and make this season the sweetest one for him. We will miss him very much after this. The best manager in the world
As a Sport Club Corinthians fan, from Brazil, I wish the best for both Liverpool and Jurgen. What a beautiful journey they have been into. I'll be following both too, with great admiration. Jurgen, what an amazing human being! ❤
Totally respect you decision Klopp its in your health best intrest youll still be loved by many🙌🏿💪🏿❤
Coach, Thank you very much for giving the game, players and fans 💯. You made the players and fans like a families. You want to win for everyone. Love ❤️ and respect 🙏 from Arsenal fans.!!! May god fulfill all your wishes and dreams 🙏
I am still can't a beautiful man and brilliant manager still crying 😭😭 heat ❤️❤️ is Brocken Ty for putt Liverpool back on the fucken top YNWA COYRM,😭😭🌹
Build this man a bronze statue at Anfield. He deserves it.
I sympathize with Jurgen Klopp's word "normal". Money, fame, and status are just enough. Too much will cause a person to fall into delusional intoxication. The state of just enough is the ideal falling point to create a happy life. A normal life. Sounds normal but is actually very special. Enough is also the philosophy of a Stoic. Like Klopp's openness. Both his football philosophy and his off-field style.
this situation make me broken heart  💔
As an American Liverpool fan all I can say is, thank you for all the great games and teams you have brought.  I can understand when you get to that point but yes you have never walked alone! We will miss you and thank you for everything and making this a great time for all us Reds fans here across the pond!!
Hope liverpool win league will be a good send off for klopp
Feels like King Kenny revisited. We all understand. And we still love both our club and our manager. Jürgen, this is not good bye, just another thank you, on our journey to future victories.
A gentleman
I am Newcastle and premier league wont be same without him absolute legend and has a class connection with the fans hope eddie howe can do this

As a united supporter i know well what an impact on loosing a legend of a manager is , but i  have always been an admirer of Klopp,  he is truly a class act and this interview shows that even more , he is bowing out in a classy and dignified way.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Man U fan here but Jurgen Klopp is a legend
I wonder how Guardiola does it? He looks like he's barely aged during his time at Man City while Klopp looks like he's aged much more. He has given everything. Turned the club around and it's been amazing. I felt last year that he has changed. His energy was different on the sidelines and I knew it was coming to an end. Thank you Jurgen for everything!
This is Not Football Anymore There's like 6-7 top Clubs in Europe that Wins all the Cups and the rest of the European Teams have Absolutely no Chance toEver win the champions league or UEFA League etc,like it was in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s! Like Dynamo kiev, Ferencvaros, Staua Bucharesti, Rangers Fc, red Star Belgrade and other small Clubs that used to wins cups pretty Regularly now once 10yrs if we lucky we see small clubs beat top 10 Giant like Real, barca, LFC, man City or Juve, Bayern etc! Rotten as Hell
To see him being totally honest is I think really brave. He's given Liverpool almost a decade and they've won silverware. Nice bloke.
His team made me love football again   How the hell do lfc replace him good luck with that Steve g?
Klopp may be sacked, but he will go out at the top. Thanks for the memories, Jurgen!
9:21 9:42 9:57 10:11 13:50
welcome to celtic ;]]
What a top bloke, considers his staff team as well as the magnitude of how it will affect the fans and  the club. Big respect from a Boro fan.
Farewell, Jürgen Klopp! Your passion, charisma, and unparalleled dedication have left an indelible mark on Liverpool FC and the footballing world. Thank you for the incredible memories, unforgettable victories, and for inspiring fans everywhere. You'll always be a legend in our hearts. Best wishes on your next journey. ❤YNWA❤
Hope he doesn't live to regret this decision best manager iv ever seen without doubt
This is how you retire from a prestigious position; Proactive and open communication towards all the people. Much respect to the legend.
I wish this gentleman all the very best for his future. We couldn't have had a better manager at LFC, in these times. God bless you, thank you, respect and YNWA Mr. Klopp!
*The interviewer's tone of voice seems callous* 👎
...mr klopp  sieht so😑 müde u ausgelazugt  aus..
Barcelona next season. No doubt about it.
I still remember very clearly when you came to the club. Amazing Klopp, Thank you..
I know that this day WOULD come. We have a season to finish and we want to finish for our manager.
Just like back at Dortmund and now Liverpool, the man knows when his job is done. He leaves before his monument begins to crumble. Before he loses his passion. Before his ego would hurt the club.
Você nos pegou de surpresa Klopp! Desejo tudo de melhor na sua vida, aproveite com a sua família, viaje, sorria como sempre,  curta os melhores momentos e nos faça um favor,  não treine Real Madrid ou Barcelona, sua ligação com o Liverpool é pra sempre!!! Obrigado por toda a sua dedicação a esse clube maravilhoso, o maior da Inglaterra que pessoas como você, fizeram se tornar.YNWA!!!
I im going to miss jurgen klopp so much heartbroken 😢😢😢
Thank you! Football became beautiful again in my life. I  followed the game since BVB times.
YNWA❤
The way he looked into the camera when asking people to accept his decision... there will be no one that can replicate what this man has done. Once a red, always a red Jurgen. Let's finish off this season winning fucking everything we can!
Gutted💔I can only hope the lads & fans can give Jurgen the send off he deserves, strapping myself in for the final few chapters, it’s been an incredible ride
THE (normal) ONE
Si ipul
as a newcastle fan ive got the upmost respect for this man and what he has achieved in football he will be a big miss in the premier league, i have a few scouse mates and after talking with them  they are totally gutted he is leaving
We gonna miss you Boss ❤ YNWA
was surprised at the news Jurgen was leaving liverpool i was on leave...proper good guy...good luck for ur future....hearing his own honest reasons for leaving you don't often hear that...im an Everton fan but do admire his honesty in the interview and to be honest will miss him being around in the premier leauge..as for Everton well hopefully we will get back up to the top again sometime
I am a Man United supporter, but loved this man the way he carried himself with such grace. He transformed Liverpool in to a great dangerous winning machine. Honestly I am so saddened by this news. It feels as if someone close has died. God bless you and thank you for the beautiful football moments. Salute!!!
There's no one better than klop I literally came home from school and when I heard I cried
Our father 😢😭❤
And the Liverpool decline begins, 1 prem title in 8 years well done😂
Some man, we'll still be talking about you in 50 years time fella, have a good one 😢👍
This was a deep interview.❤  It is amazing what a person can achieve when you become laser focused at something. In the moment you look invincible but as Klopp said the fuel tank is draining up and when it goes dry it is when everything changes. So you need to brake before that happens.   He will take a couple of years off and then be back in the football scene.
I think klopp mentality is either die a hero or live long enough to see urself to become a villain hence why believe hes doing this now whilst liverpool are at the summit
We love you Klopp ! 💗
Forever a liverpool legend its a given he will get a statue in front of anfield in a few years time.
It must be a personal issue! I wish him and his loved ones all the best❤❤❤
I worship the man and am gutted he's decided to leave. I could understand if he walked away at the end of last season when we were utter pants. But, to start building a new team then announce he's off, I just cannot fathom. He didnt know in November how this new team would go and he still cannot be certain it will improve through the rest of the season. I feel a little betrayed because he made a 'contract' with us match going fans when he told us he doesnt break contracts, doesnt walk away mid season yet here we are. We seem to have a knack of mass resignations and now, all the senior coaching staff are also going. I think 3 months after the season ends he'll regret the decision but by that time, the club will have moved on as it always does. Thanks Jurgen, Im really, really gutted and hope we can lift the title for you and the team at the last game of the season.
Im a Big Dortmund Supporter and this videos remember me so hard at the time in 2015..when Klopp leaves Borussia. I cried so many tears but in the end we played a great second halt of the season and go with a Big Laugh❤ Jürgen Klopp is the best Manager of all time for me!
sry german my friends.. ich habe noch nie so eine person gesehen.. ich habe unter brandon rodgers... steve G wegrutschen gesehen geg.chelsea .. wir haben  ein knappen titel somit verpasst und dann kam kloppo... ich kann es verstehen aber nicht glauben was hier grad läuft... ruhe dich aus und wenn es bei unserem lfc nicht laufen sollte , unter einem neue coach bitte komm zurück mit einem boooooom!!
THANK YOU
If anything, this announcement is a reminder that nothing is forever and that we should not take a moment for granted. His Guardianship at Liverpool FC has been an act of love, kindness and care. I have journeyed to so many places, both real and emotional, witnessed so many magical moments, and had so much bloody fun!  Thank you for making me a believer again, thank you Norbert for all these incredible memories embedded in my cranium but more than anything else, thank you for being you.   Alles, was Sie gegeben haben, hat mich reicher gemacht, nicht durch Geld, sondern als Mensch!
Thanks
I'm sure Liverpool would be crown as Champions at the end of season 23/24 . what would be life without the Jürgen Klopp
😢😢
Pls stay even though I respect your decision we won’t be the same without you 😢
Of course, we accept your decision! We have one life and you must live your life. The joy you still give us, have given us, and will always give us will never go unappreciated.  We stand with you Klopp!
Klopp is a real big big man.  For him the life is more important than the money.
From a neutral: great manager. Really appreciate how his teams performed since he arrived. Well done!
"It's not so important what people think when you come in, it's much more important what people think when you leave"   Jurgen Klopp (1st interviewed when he came to Liverpool)
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Vai ser mto esquisito ver o Liverpool sem o Klopp à beira do gramado. Cacete.
Top coach top bloke.
When my parents spoke about Shankley and Paisley with such fondness, I never really got it.. now I do. I will speak about Klopp to the next generation with the same love.
As a Real Madrid fan, I will always have respect for this man He’s one of those legends that you just have to respect Wish him all the best on his future endeavors
I started watching football since 2018, because of Mo Salah, Firmino and Mane. Then I felt love with this cub . Later I realized the master behind this beautiful game is Jurgen Klop. What a legend. We are missing you already. ❤️
So sad :(((
We will miss you. You are a great coach
😢😢😢
I am Chelsea support and you can't have the utmost respect for this man! With Liverpool you have too be emotionally invested and you can see he is not invested anymore and that is not fair to himself and to the club. You will be remembered for your last game...
Thank you ❤
Thank you for everything 😢
There will be now downfall for Liverpool.  The next manager will take on a serious team and bring player's with him.
We will miss you Jürgen❤❤
As a Man City fan this really got me crying 😢like this is sad 🫶🏾❤️ my roommate was a Liverpool fan and the rivalry brought a great character to our brotherhood. We love you forever Klopp♾️
Firstly, thank you from the bottom of my heart for the last 9 years at LFC. I've had a season ticket for 32 years at Anfield and can honestly say these last 9 have been THE BEST of those watching you and your teams winning everything!   Second, I hope you and your family get to spend a lot more time together doing the things you enjoy and I wish you all  every future happiness  Lastly I'm not sure you truly know how much you are loved by us fans. There will never be another LFC manager like you. We have been truly blessed to have you at our club all these years. You are a uniquely gifted manager,  incredibly charismatic and just a wonderful human being. You will be truly missed YNWA
I literally started crying half way thru I had to stop watching and watch the rest later. Klopp is truly inspiring. He made me want to watch football again.
This was bad timing or good timing it could go both ways for the morale of the team this season,depends how they'll take it, hopefully we can get our hands on that PL trophy again while Jurgen still in charge.
We proud of you.. Mr. Klopp.  And i hope.. Zidane zidan.. Will be the next manager..here. YNWA
He was born as a coach
I'm walking alone😔😔
I would've loved Klopp to coach Ronaldo. He is a legend of the game.
As a Chelsea fan  THANK YOU JURGEN KLOPP  we love so much  It's so hard for us to hear that
I pushed away watching this video for 24 hours, forced myself through it now. Sobbing, feels like losing a family member. YNWA Jürgen ❤
Thank you so much !!!
Was a hard video to give a thumbs up but I did, really sad to see you departing Klopp, what a journey and a dream, and you were my favourite post match interview watch :)
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
He was my favorite coach across all of sports. The way he connected with the supporters is what sold me. Poor guy had a damn meltdown. In the end he is just like everybody else and has a breaking point. However this decision convinced me he is going to turn his life around and take care of himself priority number one. He’s so human and easy to understand. Surely he’ll remain in football in other capacities. Football still needs him, but for now it’s time to focus on one’s self. We wish him the best of luck!
This means so much more. Thank you for all, the sport obviously but humanity, dreams, excellence, respect, always smiling and hoping through the murk. Absolute legend. Thank you Jurgen.
Such a selfless act by klopp. He knew he wasn't Liverpool's future so he has given them time to plan for it.
Best wishes to Jurgen and his family, thank you for all the memories - YNWA.
Cnt say anything smart.this hurts
As a normal man, Im a dentist, normal life, I 100% understand you. You doing this, this way, you did it the CORRECT way. You Are HUGE KLOPP
He will do a great job at barca
Basically its sounding as if he needs a break, to spend more time with his family,  and  more time at home.
Then Salah is definitely leaving the team
😭😭😭😭❤️❤️
Love him to bits man. I'm gutted
Man muß es natürlich respektieren. Aber es ist sehr, sehr schade! Alles Gute!
He is the best manager in the world, no I'm not a Liverpool fan just a fan of football. He will manage the Germany national team in the near future. Jurgen made me fall in love with Dortmund, his character and passion is worth all of the trophies Pep and Jose have won.  A big loss for the Premier League not just Liverpool.
Whether he decides to stay or not...Just this message is a boost for the team towards the title, playing for the 'Last time'. The timing of the message matters.  Well played Klopp.
I am a man united fan and i am upset. I love his passion , enthusiasm and respect that he shows the players, he personally goes to the players as they come off the pitch. I feel his connection. I wish united had got him as their coach. We need a klopp.
The greatest manager in Liverpool history 🐐❤️😭
Man the end of this interview really got me emotional i didnt want this to end i love Klopp
Love You Man :D Take care :)
From a neutral , from an arsenal fan what a legend  What a man   I now live in Liverpool and boy do they respect this man as do i.   My wife is a LFC fan / scouser and one of my daughters and they are sad 😮  This was a real , humble , well spoken , genuine , heartfelt good bye notice
😢😢😢😢😢
;((
:((((
Danke! Danke!
I'm not a Liverpool FC fan but I'm going to miss Klopp. Is he saying though that he's quitting football? That will be super sad for football. He's a great guy and a wonderful manager
You made us dream again and changed us from Doubter's to belivers ❤️❤️💔💔... We are so glad that this happened... You will be missed 💔😭.. YNWA💔
Love Klopp’s integrity, this interview showed his class, I made up my mind that he was the best manager in the premier league the day he was asked a question in a press conference and his reply was; Klopp, “I don’t talk to the Sun.” That was gold.. ❤️
What a pity. I thought Klopp would be the Ferguson of Anfield. Unfortunately, Liverpool will return to the days before Klopp and slip into grey mediocrity
a year i guarantee he be managing in Spain or Italy or Germany
we will miss you 😥
Jürgen Klopp go for Bundestrainer in germany 🇩🇪
I will miss him A LOT! /Arsenal fan
Love you, Klopp, thank you for all the beautiful memories 🎉
Come to FC Barcelona and end our misery.
Goodbuy
I'm a Real Madrid fan, and I have huge huge respect for Mr Klopp. He changed the way soccer is played and always was as well as the team, beautiful to watch and model that shows that soccer is a game played by love and a sense of belonging to the team.  I wish him a great life and relax, also might Liverpool stay among the top teams.
Klopp -  Klopp -  Klopp - YNWA - 🏆🏆🏆 -  ⚽️⚽️⚽️ ( We will miss you)  😥😥😥
Hurts watching this
41 years as a Liverpool fan, I had a chance to see lfc won the premier title after 30 years of wait. Was an awesome feeling Jurgen turns doubters to believers and I believe! Thank you Jurgen Klopp for that moment will I cherish in our new chapter in history.
Tome uma decisão antes que ela te tome. Antes de tomar qualquer decisão pense e repense, e serás feliz na sua escolha, pois aquele que pensa encontra o melhor caminho.
😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔
Don’t make this about me, meanwhile 👀
We shall miss you so much,
All the best mate! you are a titan!
El Real Madrid te espera Jefe. Aquí será feliz, ganarás la distinción que se merece. En Inglaterra la vida es fría y aburrida 😴
I'ma Gooner but had to come ehre to how to love Klopp absolute love this man throuh int hrough out cuz what he has done for the PL is incredible I love Arsenal a lot bu I respect and love this guy too prolly not his club that much but Klop himself yes so had to make it here.
Looks like some issues about transfer with the club
Im very sad with this news
Give David Moyes a 6 year contract!
Thank you Jürgen for everything you did for Liverpool but more important for us Germans. You are the best ambassador I can imagine, you show the world and our friends in UK how Germans really are - honest, empathic, world open and respectful. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I became a Liverpool fan because of you and will keep watching Liverpool FC channel but it won’t be the same without you…
Let’s hope Liverpool win the league this year for klopp! He deserves it
Tolong jangan tinggalkan kami coach. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭. Bertahanlah lebih lamaaa
Just 2 Words Sum This Man Up - Utter Class..!!! Will Be Missed Klopp Coming From A Stoke Fan.!
❤
We love you Yeah  Klopp, we love you so We want you to know That were gonna miss your bumps The minute you walk out that door  So please don't go, don't go Don't go away Please don't go, don't go The Kop is begging you to stay  If you leave, at least in my lifetime I've had one dream come true We was blessed to be managed By someone as wonderful as you   So please don't go, don't go Don't go away Please don't go, don't go The kop is begging you to stay, hey, hey, hey
Be-Kloppt
"Let's now really go for it. The outside world want to use that, this decision, laugh about it blah blah blah, wanna disturb us.. *shrugs shoulders* We Are Liverpool. We went through harder things together.. and.. you went through harder things before me.. and let's make a strength of it. That will be really cool. Let's squeeze everything out of this season and have another thing to smile about when we look back in the future. Thank you"  I am a Liverpool fan but jesus even if I wasn't I would want to run through brick walls for this guy. What a man. YNWA.
Jürgen Klopp is a hero of the city. Manager of LFC he is a Scouser he is family. He has turned things around here our opponents from other cities near or far respect him. Over there they fear him they settle up shop sit back before him it was all them, now they try to stop us playing our football they give up on theirs. The impact one man has had is massive. He is the embodiment of the twelfth man we will support him right to the end as we always have YNWA.
Jk liverpool fans will miss you, you changed Liverpool for the future, fans dreamt, brought the club to greatest.,we look to each game because of you, i hope you change your mind and go for 1 more season
Der beste Trainer der Welt.
LEGEND FOREVER!🙏🏻❤
Bis später , champ😊
Come back after the break...
Thank you for all you have done Enjoy your future You will always be Liverpool FC !
Thank Klopp
Good riddance
😢😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢
the Best.
The fateful day has arrived...We now understand what Dortmund fans felt. And i can say it's a mixed feeling. Happy for him, sad for liverpool
Not a Liverpool fan but this man is a legend it’s sad to see him go . I think Liverpool will bring Alonso in now
Hes like a father figure to all us Liverpool supporters, its breaking my heart that he won't be with us next season. He built the club from such a  dark place to been an incredible club that the top players want to play for. Build the statue of him now. Legend.
I am Chelsea supporter, but Big Big respect for him. He is the one of best managers. Good luck, have great rest, we ready miss you. Legend 💙⚽️
One word only RESPECT 💪🏻😞😞😞😞 I’m not even a Liverpool fan but a football fan he did a more than brilliant job in Liverpool. His honesty is fantastic , I will miss him at Liverpool…… do your thing Jurgen 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I disagree with the saying men don't cry💔💔💔
😢
So what Saudi club is he off to . WAKE UP
I've been a Liverpool fan since Miracle of Istanbul. I supported my team even in the dark ages. Klopp was a great person. Thank you for your hard work.
He's only human, the man is knackered.  This could be a great opportunity for the likes of Roy Hodgson, Sam Alardyce or someone else maybe David Moyes
That much money is hard to turn down….
Thanks for win premier league and champions league. I’m crying 😢
Rangers fan here.  Years ago I used to pick up a Hibby/Liverpool fan on ma way ti work.  He wiz always ranting & raving about how good Klopp is.  Numerous times I had ti tell the lad "I know mate, calm doon!".  Not only is Klopp one of best managers he's one funny guy plus absolutely dedicated to the club & Liverpool.   Do as he says and accept his decision & push on.  Time for a farewell party will come but focus yer energy & enthusiasm on next game & not on Klopp.   All the best👏
Klop from his heart❤
omg...i cant believe it. He is irreplaceable. What are we going to do? I love him very much. Thank you so much for the wonderful years. We have all grown together. But I understand your decision. I respect it. My love n best wishes to you.
Be the director. Stay with liverpool.
Wow. I can’t believe that the best manager Liverpool ever had will be leaving the club. I from Florida feel the sadness that millions of Liverpool fans can do
What a manager and character of the game good luck with your next endeavours !!!
His new Team vaxxing boosters ?
Noooo😭😭😭
We will miss the man, his laughter, his press conferences, his voice. From a Gooner
The Greatest
We will forever miss u . Legendary coach . Ynwa Man
All of my life I've been a Liverpool fan. I'm grateful to witness him and his Liverpool teams. Thank you, Mr Jurgen Klopp. Best wishes for you.
As a United fan I'm not as happy as I thought I'd be to hear him leaving. As a rival fan I just want to say thank you to the absolute class and standard you have brought to this League as a whole. You made the United and Liverpool rivalry great and I always respected your passion. This premier league is about to lose the last great manager of the greatest Era in English football. Damn it. Klopp has given his life to Liverpool. And the fans in turn have immortalized him. All the best to you Sir. Much respect, a United fan
Sedih
The way he’s talking makes me thinks he’s ill and wants to spend as much time as possible with his family. I hope I’m wrong. But klopp should do whatever is best for him. If he wants to leave, we accept. As sad as it may be.
Why,😭😭😭😭
He is the real world Ted Lasso!
a big loss for the Premier League. Will miss him.
Noooooooooooooo 😢🥺😢🥺😢😢😢😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺😢😢😢🥺😢😢🥺😢😢
The feeling right now for me is like end of the world 😭😭😭
TE AMOOOO LIVERPOOL, klopp forever❤❤❤❤❤❤🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Danke Juergen
Once a Red always Red ❤
Football became a Zionist controlled sports that’s why
🥺😭
XAVI ALONSO for a beggening of a new Era.......Thanks to klopp👋😔
What a man. What a Legend.
💔💔😑
محبوب جدا والمغادرة شيئ صعب من انسان لطيف مثله😢
Why??? Why leave while on top??? Xabi maybe good BUT everything works now. No football team ever changed the entire midfielder and works like Liverpool now. Should I send a complain to Fenway sport??? 😢😭
I SUPPORT CITY
U R SO RUBBISH AND BAD
Morrinhoo their is job for you
I'm so sad 😞 Klopp I will miss you terribly , myself and the rest of the world 😢   we love you for the time you have spent with us 🫶
Thank you so much ,Jurgen. Like everybody else I am so sorry you have decided to leave. Liverpool have been so fortunate .. So many Supporters from other Clubs would have loved to have had you as their Manager   I wish you all the best . Janet Haines
Jürgen klopp I have been a Liverpool supporter for all my life now and I can finally start to realise how much things you have done for this club I understand your reasons for leaving this club as you are now 56 if I am not mistaken. You were a brilliant manager ❤ and I remember you managing this club years ago. I am sad and I am sure everybody else is aswell. I just can’t express how sad I am and there are no words for it. In my world you were THE BEST MANAGER. Look at the bright side you have won the following trophies  • FIFA CLUB WORLD CUP: 2019 •UEFA SUPER CUP:2019 •UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE:2019 •FA COMMUNITY SHIELD:2022 •EFL CUP:2021/2022 •FA CUP:2021/2022 •PREMIER LEAGUE: 2019/2022 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤  I guess 2019 was your prime year 😅   COME ON LIVERPOOL JÜRGEN WILL TAKE US HOME  your job is not finished mate  WE STILL HAVE PREMIER LEAGUE TO WIN   My last wishes klopp Farewell YNWA  🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥  PS. I hope our next manager is good but I know he will never be better than Jürgen klopp😢
I am truly heart broken. I know you need to take care of you yourself and your family as you should. That should always your main priority. You've done soo much for us. I can't imagine the stress of being the face of such an incredible club like Liverpool. But just know this jurgen, you have cemented yourself in our hearts and in this club forever. We love you and we thank you for givin us hope again. Lets finish this season with a bang🙏🙏🙏🙌🙌 YNWA
Warum? Weil Deutschland einen guten Nationaltrainer braucht 😂
Difference between klopp and benitez, he wouldn’t manage another club in England, benitez managed Everton and Chelsea and would def manage United lol
As a barca fan all i can say is this man is a icon of football and he deserves to leave on his terms without doubt hes won everything and brought liverpool back to the top of football. Legend
Imagine having to work in Kirkby every day though, no wonder he’s fed up 🤣🤣🤣 nice one for going Klopp from a happy Evertonian 👍💙
I'm worried cause you finish that years with we, the sporters of Liverpool So for me I respect you and congratulate you for the remountada. Respect for you dad.
The Premier League will be worse off without him
I Will not crying,,, im just worried about  Storm What will be difficult for us to face without Klopp... whoever is the next coach...
With Salah and Van Dijk in their twilight years this could be the beginning of the end for Liverpool's recent success.
😮😊 I'm sorry chess  final ❤😅
Bro watched the Vinland saga 😅😂😂
you LFC guys have been wonderfully lucky and are to be envied to have had such a ride with "the normal one" -  has some Ted Lasso vibes (foreshadowed by Jason Sudeikis?)
One of the best coach in football history       ☄️🌍 🕳️
Boss, thank you for all the memories. YNWA ♥️😭
YNWA love from Poland ❤
As a man United fan ,he is undoubtedly the best manger and keeps players focused for every game and no bollix in dressing rooms like ours good luck in the future 👍  👏
Shout out to the rest of the coaching team.  Those guys have worked tirelessly for us and the club, constantly helping in turning good players into great players. The whole backroom team deserve our gratitude
I personally believe he did it for his family. I’m guessing the missus just wants to go back home & so he put his family first. A really great man, a person to definitely admire.
Two Words: CLASS ACT🙏🏼
The humble one.
YNWA Jurgen
Jürgen Klopp, an honest and decent man right down to his toes.
We will miss you Juergen and u will forever remembered and hopefully we can achieve a lot this season cuz u deserve a special farewell wish u all the best and I wish I could meet you one day ❤❤
Come to santa cruz
He embodies the spirit of Liverpool, and he's achieved so much with them that you can't feel like he's got unfinished business. He's going out on top, and I have nothing but respect for him.
No! Please No! It’s toooo hard to except…
👎⚽️💪💪😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔔🐐🤣💜❤️‍🔥
When the news first came in, I was in a small room in Saitama, Japan, eagerly waiting for updates on my computer screen. Little did I know that it would bring such a wave of emotions, leaving me in tears of sadness. Klopp had become more than just a manager to us; he was an inspiration, a motivator, and a symbol of hope.
what a legend, er ist eine legende, no one can be like him, niemand ist so krass wie klopp - THANK U
going to barca or realmadrid i think
Liverpool in its history has made many many comebacks, and i proud, so i' m your fan My club, but the most important comeback will be - return our boss, dear Jürgen! We 😢😢' ll be waiting for you 🙏
I am not a Liverpool fan, but I am genuinely sad to see JK leave.  He is a great professional role model and a great human being - a rare combination.  I wish him all the best.
Legend in Germany Legend im England The world needs more people like him
as a dortmund fan i can only say kloppo is very very special and i miss him to this day
Wow what a guy
From a MUFC fan: You'll never walk alone!
The best manger ever you’ll be missed ❤️❤️
❤ The normal one  แด่คนธรรมดา ผู้แสนพิเศษ  หวังว่าโชคชะตาจะพาเรามาบรรจบกันอีกสักครั้ง YNWA
Hmmm what a man I may say you are a true definition of sincerity many people will forever miss you in football your fatherly roles among your players will be missed. Klop U will never walk alone. May the Almighty God continue to bless and protect you and your family.
Even as a Gunner fan this bloke will be sadly miss
If pep wasn’t there… imagine… Klopp would’ve had at least 2 more PL titles for LFC… what a rivalry, what a man! Thank you for your service and bringing the club back to where it belongs! Great respect and after this interview, all u can really say is… fair enough!
I was shocked initially as we all were and now that i have been able to process it for a day it feels like i am in mourning.                 This man picked us up when we were in a pitiful state and took us all the way to champions of the world! I think about our final home game and his goodbye and I feel a lump in my throat and my eyes well up. I never even felt like this for greats like Gerrard, Carragher who called time at Liverpool after so many years. This is different. I used to think what will we do without Gerrard and here we are mostly because of Klopp.                             I dont know who we will get for next season but it will be tough to fill the boots of a manager like Klopp. It is rare when a clubs identity is so closely linked to its manager but Klopp achieved that. Its a tough one to take especially when he has won so much and knowing that he deserved to win even more and coming so close to doing so. He really deserved a league or 2 more and a champions league more at the least so I hope they can get over the line this year in the league which i know is going to be a tough ask but what a send off that would be. Grateful for the memories and for those to come in the next few months but at the same time I am heartbroken. These 9 seasons have really flown by and we should just enjoy the little time that we have left. What a ride it has been. YNWA
Will miss him. Absolute Legend.
As a city fan i really enjoyed the riveraly
I will miss klopp
You are a very good men. I understand you. Thanks for your time and effort and help for Liverpool fc. You are good for football grate stuff that you all the best to you and your family good luck to you from Lancashire England UK pendle 🙏👌👍🇬🇧😪
Thanks klopp for what you’ve done for this club it’s been so interesting and incredible what you’ve done and achieved and we appreciate you and thank you , you are a club legend.
this men is sick , if you look to his face color something is really bad .I think that medical problems force him to step down . I wish him all the best .
Liverpool is Klopp and Klopp is Liverpool
Legend
He's a winner
Lets hope that one day Jurgen will be back to Liverpool
Goat!!!!!
Premier League is becoming more like a farmers league like Bundesliga and Ligue 1
This and leaving like this is the best Klopp thing ever. Leave before it goes down hill. He loves the club to much to see all the hard work get wasted because he stays to long.  It's always beat to leave before you're asked. What a class move.  The Klopp Era will forever be my favorite.  Thank you
Superb human  being.  Listening to him with his honesty, integrity and love for Liverpool FC brought a tear to my eye. Whatever you do next Jurgen, all will be behind you, be they Liverpool fans or not.
This evening, my customer said "Klopp will leave Liverpool". Suddently I take my phone and i say "Look! I never put a picture who  someone I love in my wallpaper screen except Klopp". And I'm crying 🥹
One of the saddest days of my life. Klopp had completely transformed LFC back to it's Glory. We'll surely miss you the best manager ever!!!
As a fans. I would like to say thank you. YNWA
What a man, What a leader, What a great heart, such honesty and humanity. Let us play. . "You will never walk alone"
From Arsenal fan, I have so much respect and admiration for Klopp. I love him a lot and what he did at Liverpool is nothing short of AMAZING. You leave an incredible legacy and all the football fans will remember everything you did forever — enjoy your time off, Boss ❤️
Hasta luego JEFE!! Gracias por todo lo que hiciste por el liverpool.. se te va a extrañar
As an MU fan, I cannot adore Klopp anymore than I already do. He will leave with thunderous applause from all of us. He gave me arguably my most enjoyed match in my life thus far - the 4-0 victory over Barcelona.
You turned the doubters into believers.Thank you Jurgen Klopp for everything❤.You have set the bar too high it will ne hard for the next manager to properly fit into your shoes.YNWA
Not gonna lie as a Manchester United Fan, I was always hoping that he would leave Liverpool! I used to think its been so long, please move on and go manage the German National Team or something. And this more than anything else tells how great he has been for Liverpool! Absolute Legend!
Thx Boss ❤
It's hard not to feel the same emotions the Mainz and Dortmund fans have been living through for years.  He's an exceptional human being and his legend will only grow at Liverpool in the years to come.
after our premier League win...this inform talents need zidane for hat thricks mark my word it will happen..jurgen u r the master❤🎉🎉🎉
Thank you so much for all. You are the Master and The Liverpool is the best football club. Good luck Jurgen!
Alles Gute ❤
Things that strike most in the interview- honest, balance, understanding. I think these describe him best in his whole managerial role, and thus adds a fourth one - consistency! What a champ, as a manager, as a person!
so sad, what a man
He's a living Legend der Jürgen Abi.
Don't cry because it ended cry because it	 happened
This is my future  nightmare who totally kill my confidence....I can't accept without urgen ...please don't do..
It's crazy, when my bf asked me, if i knew about Jurgen leaving LFC, i was like, where it says, absolutely no idea, my tears fell😢😢😢..even watching this my heart is breaking heavily. my favorite sports person, manager, a down to earth human being...can't believe it though, but the fact, reality, only constant in life is "CHANGE", we just need to be ready and accept it. ..i wish you all the best and nothing but the best only onwards, stay happy and healthy always, much love❤❤❤
Mi entrenador 😢❤YNWA
why 😭😭😭
Hahaha Liverpool finished now just like Man Utd after Ferguson era .
YNWA, and we’ll wait to sing his praises until the time comes ❤❤
Thank you for everything boss YNWA
He is my goat and my hero mr klopp ❤❤❤
WOW respect😎
Klopp is the best thing that has ever  happened to Liverpool. What he has achieved with the club is outstanding. The trophies, the signings, player development, backroom staff, commitment to the  fans, the list is endless and it will be forever missed.  Mourinho said a long time ago that he was the "special one", Klopp said he was the "normal one". The real truth is that Klopp is the greatest manager in the world, and the most loved manager in football history. What an absolute legend 👏. As a Liverpool fan I'm gutted 😢. There isn't anyone near this man's level. Not Alonso, not Gerrard, not anyone. The world's best managers are Klopp, Pep, Zidane, and probably Ancelotti. God knows what Liverpool are gonna do. I have no words. YNWA
A year off..then Bayern, Madrid, Barca or Inter on his door step....
Rivalries aside, he's a legend. Peak Liverpool under him around 2019 were one of the best teams I've ever seen. Scary what they did to some top level teams. He's also stayed long enough to leave a mark on the club, the players etc. Don't care what any united fans say, but how can you not admire him on a footballing basis? If only we could appoint half the manager he is.
Special Kloop! Respect
The Best DT in all time,,the intensity that he put on the pitch is no compared with no other,, he is a very good person ho motivated the Yung generation,, y have unique eyes to discover talent
That end speech was cold ynwa
Trying to replace this man will be harder than trying to replace salah
❤❤❤❤
I am not a football fan at all and even I love this man! I came to hear him by pure luck (thank you YouTube algorithm!) and I already gained from listening to him. Whatever you do I’ll keep an eye for it! And good luck to Liverpool, I may become a fan just because of him actually ❤️ well and because you are a great team too.
He's coming home 🇩🇪
I think the best thing to do is make every home game feel like a european night.
Gutted
Love you, Jurgen!!! definitly the best decision for your heart is the best decision... you made me love football and liverpool even more... you made me soooo soooo happy iin so much times... across so much years.... i wish you the best... and this makes me admire you and respect you even more!!  time to look within!! so enjoy yourself!
FINALY 😁😁😁😁😁😁, now Liverpool will go back to being a mid tabell team where they really belong 🤠
Thank you, Jurgen. Even Pep will miss you.
The real reason Jurgen is leaving.- He didn't say it and he can't say it, he actually said it if you can read between the lines. During last season when things were going really bad, there were a lot talks about he given everything he could, he got nothing left, and maybe it's time for him to leave. Well, he finished the season strong and was determined to prove to doubters wrong. Now the team is well positioned to move forward, so I s the right time for him to leave. I am sure he thought about quitting last year, but he didn't want to go out like that. He feels like the team will win at least 2 things this year and that will be enough . He will probably take Germany after a year and lead them to the next World Cup.
Masih ngerasa belum percaya dengan hal ini
Keren judul video nya pakai bahasa indonesia,terbukti bahwa bahasa kita, yaitu bahasa indonesia sangat mendunia
This is indeed, a great human kind a leader, put the other first.
Legend❤
Thank you for everything Jurgen😢 you will be missed
Though I am an arsenal fan, but well done klop
Legend!
Not a Liverpool fan but this guy is an absolute legend in the history of football. What a manager. What a man
If only our world leaders are half the man you are Jurgen, the world would be a much better place. You truly place the group above yourself, you are the normal one indeed. You will never walk alone wherever you are and whatever you do next. We will miss you always!
15:00 real german this guy.. uses a car analogy to describe his situation. My manager 👊🏾👓
This is why he is the normal 1 ❤❤❤❤
Thank you, Jürgen. You're a massive inspiration. Making such a difficult decision, but being such a stand up guy about it and communicating properly with everyone. It's a marvel. The football world needs more people like you.
Where can i find his sweater? 😅
Didn't win much so will be forgotten soon enough...facts.
believe it or not, when Klopp leaves Liverpool will be like Manchester United. Manchester United was doing until Sir Alex and Jose Mourinho left. I am scared.
Thomas frank
Can not stop tears right now💔🥲
What Honesty,what a Man,Thank you Jurgen ❤
😢😢😢 OMG , I just saw this. 😢😢😢😢😢 How will I survive knowing kloppo won't be on the torchline to push the boys mentally. A crack Indeed has occurred. Let's honour him with the league boys and we are Liverpool, we will move on. You'll never walk alone KLOPP. WE CALL HIM KLOPPO
Hope he wins the league in his last dance against Pep😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭
This was amazing video so funny I've never seen the likes... hes sacked himself.. klopp to be Germany manager in a year
Ynwa jurgen
This is shocking news ever since i started watching football this man has been the manager of liverpool F.C so him leaving now it’s crazy
He will and deserves to have a statue outside the stadium. A living legend of our game.  Jurgèn YNWA
Yes, as humans, we need to resource ourselves. You deserve it. Your name will be written in gold.
we will miss you klopp thanks for all the good times you have bought to this club you will be in are hearts for ever you are the best manager we have had all the best in the future 💚👊😢
NEWS JUST IN!!!!! Jurgen Klopp is going to Chelsea 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hope they are working on his statue as I type this...Thank you Mr. Klopp.
Hopefully, he comes to a team thats can back him properly come to man utd 😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks for your time Jurgen
A rigidez cobra seu preço, exaustão
Great manager! Liverpool were lucky to have him.
Wow. What a guy ... what a manager.. simply the best  Thank you
As much as it hurts as a Liverpool fan that he is leaving it hurts just as much as a football fan that he may not manage again. To your health Jurgen and thank you for everything you've given us.
It's a bit difficult to accept this reality, thank you very much Jurgen Klopp, thank you for these 9 years😢
❤❤❤❤🎉
So much respect for this man
Always be prudent to leave a setup when you still being more than loved  Ferguson did the same at man u Wenger didn’t read the playbook,look how he ended his tenure  Kudos clop❤
😢😢😢❤
That gap to fill will be the toughest job in soccer on our planet; need bravery and ambition and more to succeed after Klopp - and tactical skill to name a few.
Good Luck to Klopp
You are my hero jurgen...to be honest since i know football when i was 7years old and liverpool is my favourite team, you are the one and only manager who can built and developed team and club management.   Please make a statue for this man...  Me and all liverpool fans gonna miss you so much jurgen...YNWA❤❤❤
If not promote from within, then for me the only choice of successor is XABI
Not even a Liverpool fan but this man is a legend. His in game tactical management is second to none, will be sorely missed in the Prem
We gonna miss you Jurgen Klopp love from Uganda 🇺🇬.
So heartbreaking😢
Great and honest interview . What he achieved was brilliant . Lovely man put a smile back into football. All the best Jurgen Klopp you will be sadly and greatly missed but thanks again.
❤
My manager ❤️
you will not walk alone yürken klopp❤
This guy is very passionate and honest ... he knows what he wants and can do .. inspiring to be honest
Such sad news he’s a humble man but life is too short looks like he’s put his all in and burnt himself out pleasing everyone except himself maybe 🤔😢
No matter where you are , you will always and forever be in our hearts,Thank you for everything my boss
I❤ kloop
Lets win some trophies to give proper farewell to one of the best. For the future, maybe give Pep Ljinders a chance before Alonso or De Zerbi, just a thought.
i mean it could still be an April fool joke, not believing until after April 1st 😎
I am  very  sad because  I am the  liverpool  Fan and kloop
I have tremendous respect for this man. I'm a Man U supporter however Liverpool are a great club and Klopp has put them back at the top again. The reason he can do this is the same reason he is now leaving. Honesty, integrity, intelligence and determination. The lesson learned is don't do anything unless you give everything to it. Klopp deserves a good future and Liverpool will move on. After all the club initially had the foresight to sing him but now they have a massive challenge to replace him.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you Klopp, it's been a great ride. Devasted and gutted but personal health and family comes first. Applaud him for announcing it earlier, at least we have time to search for a a new coach, backroom staffs, manager, and sort out other internal matters.   All the best Klopp ❤🙏🏽

Legend ❤️
why 😢😢😢😢, Love u Jurgen Klopp we boss, please don't go
United fan here. My condolences to my enemies Liverpool FC for losing one of the greatest premier league era managers. Someone i’ve admired and was jealous of when you snatched him from Dortmund, a fantastic coach and brought Liverpool back to the top fighting for titles. 👍
Thank you JK❤😢
Sky has fallen!
Huge respect! People are no longer made like this.
This story like my girlfriend broke my heart. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢. Big thanks man YNWA.
I think he's running away from something. Liverpool are top of the table on a quest for a quad.  this makes no sense, this Stinks of a scandal.
I'm glad he's leaving. His tenure has been a failure; he should've won more trophies. Spends more time complaining than actually competing with Pep. It's because Klopp's seeming nonchalance that Pep has won so many trophies. Bye bye
I have the greatest admiration for Jurgen Klopp, who is a remarkable man and a topnotch football manager. And his reason for leaving this season makes perfect sense, because he thrives on energy but can see (as he says) that the tank is nearing empty. His  self-knowledge and foresight are strengths that all of us should note and learn from.
Now I know how those Dortmund fans felt in 2015…….
🥹 thank u for everything sir
The only thing more impossible than what this man achieved is any person's ability to dislike him. Truly authentic and genuine, I could listen to him for hours.
You mean the world to us,  Thank you for everything Klopp.
😢
Man united all the way, but this man is such a legend and a gentleman. I wish more managers could be so down to earth like klopp. Premier league will be less without him.
Great manager and human begin, but unlucky for him there were a Realmadrid and a Pep Guardiola as his rivals...
شكرا على الترجمة
Worst thing to hear about our team💔💔
2:12
Thank you, Kloop. I was so happy to see your"Kloop's ball" cheeks with my own eyes at the same time. It was a happy time. I was so proud to be able to build the "Red Empire" with you again. I'll cheer for you more and moer this season🔥🔥🔥Korea's "Normal two" to "Normal one"
YNWA
Don’t Cry Because It’s Over, Smile Because It Happend❤️🥲
Thank you for everything. Though not a  Liverpool fan but as a football fan all I can say is Klop definitely deserves massive respect.
😢 Thank U Klopp YNWA😢😢😢
He must have to get chance to coach German national team, German team is really needing such a brilliant, cooperative and talented coach. One of the world best team German present condition is very very detouring only a person who can bring the four time world cup winner back is Jürgen Klops.
This destroyed me 💔
his finishing message is so so genuine and sweet, lets get it reds!
Thank YOU Jurgen, we love you! ❤️
😰😢😢
Wow. We would miss you. A great pro
😭😭😭
💔
There isn’t a competent manager out there on Klopps level.   Alonso is too inexperienced and hasn’t experienced any struggle as a manager. Leverkusen is not Liverpool. Bundesliga isn’t Premier League.   Premier league is different now to when Klopp arrived. It’s 10X stronger.   Liverpool is too big for De Zerbi.   Too big for Potter.   Mourinho is to pragmatic in style of play.   Who is left who is remotely elite? Going to play the style of football Liverpool play?   The only manager who plays similar to Klopp is Postecoglu!   I hope this isn’t the demise of Liverpool. 😮
I’m literally crying 😢 I love him ❤ Liverpool won’t be the same without him 😢😢😢😢
Arsenal fan here, sad to see him leave. He was a great addition to Liverpool & the Premier league
Such a great man, leader and has had such a wonderful influence on many people 😀👌.  Thank you for your good influence, and congratulations on a new and exciting thing ahead for you Jurgen!  😀👍  God bless you!  😀👍☀🕊
Tanks for honesty and the years which you gave us. Best wishes for the years that you gave us hope.good luck for the future.❤❤❤❤👍
Scripted, now Xabi is coming to Liverpool
Thank you Klopp! You're up there with the biggest legends of the club!
Klopp manages the Liverpool team to major victories without big budget spending except on Van Dyke and Alisson. But both are match winners. That's why I think he is the greatest manager in recent years.
Football in general and this club and it’s greats have got me through so much hardship over the years , Thankyou klopp for allowing us to live in a little bubble of bliss for 90 minutes a week and making us proud of our great club once more 🫡
I'm not a Liverpool fan but is my 1.5 team. I respect and appreciate this man. What a man!! He is Mr. Liverpool for me. All the best klopp wish you have what you desire.
I really hurt so much to hear this. He's the best of manager. He looks like our family.  but, I really really understand his reason and respect the boss's decision.  Make the magic season to happen!!!  and say thank you after the end of special season. YNWA
As an Arsenal fan, I can't express how much respect I have for Klopp. He seems like an honest, thoughtful and genuinely good man. I almost want Liverpool to win a major trophy this season just to truly have him finish on the high he so clearly deserves.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm not even a liverpool fan but would love to see liverpool win the league this season as a send off to such an incredible manager and person i'm sure the players are going to do everything they can to do that
This is one of the most sad interviews id ever watched..😢😢
Mr Jurgen Klopp this message is addressed to you and I hope you will see it, I love you so much you have filled my heart with happiness, joy, reactions, sensations so crazy that I won't be able to write here in a simple message to you made me love Liverpool, the little Senegalese who lives in Dakar, I cannot thank you, I supported and love Liverpool because of you, your person in the game, you produced energy, you gave us a smile screaming in front of the TV I have always been confident seeing your face, I love you and I wish you the best as you said you will never coach another English club I have confidence in you, this departure still saddens me too much but it doesn't matter we will get back up but know that we will continue to love you and support you wherever you are❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dark day for football
THANK YOU MR KLOPP🤞🏾🙌🏾 You made the Prem such a buzz of a league! All best wishes for the future❤ 🍾 -a Cityzen
Thank you so much for you and your coaching team. May the good Lord be with you and your team for the days of your lives. 💚💛❤️
Broke my heart I wouldn't lie. He was a perfect match for what Liverpool represented. I think I know where this is coming from. last season was poor by Liverpool standards, reflecting on Klops time at Dortmund,  he hit similar brick wall, but fans and club couldn't let him go and it continually went bad. He knows himself and wouldn't want to damage the accomplishments at Liverpool.  Burnout is real and for someone like him that works with his being its more.  Klop no longer smile like he used to; loosing your person in the quest of a goal is what great minds don't want to do.  As a human being and a Liverpool fan. A book should be written for us to understand the psychology of klop. We love you always and wish the best for you as you have always wished the best for our club.
Amazing interview Klopp is legend.
Clearly someone higher up in the EPL doesnt want LFC to win but his team just can’t stop succeeding
When I saw the message I was like " God let this be fake news "😢😭 tears literally rolled my cheeks 😭😭😭. Jurgen Norbert Klopp will forever be engraved in our hearts  YNWA❤❤😢😭
Thank you Jurgen Klopp for choosing Liverpool FC. You are an absolute legend. Truly, YNWA! 3rd generation fan from Cape Town🇿🇦
Thank you for everything Jurgen!!!
We need a All or Nothing documentary ASAP
We need a All or Nothing documentary ASAP
We need a All or Nothing documentary ASAP
What a man. I hope he will come back for german national coach. We need him so much !!!! Viel Glück Jürgen. Du bist unglaublich. Macht mich irgendwie traurig, dass Du aufhörst. Wegen Dir bin ich ein Liverpool-Fan geworden 😉
He's taken the club as far as he thinks he can take them.
Klopp always will be a part of this family. A true legend.
From Utd supporter this was sad to watch. Man gave all his heart, love and dedication to the club. He will be missed in the Premier League massively
I belief it has to do with the owners wanting to do live broadcast of locker room, training, and etc.. which jk said he will leave if it happens
How about making him a freeman of the city before he retires. If he isn't already that is
Thank you so much for everything Jurgen, a lot of tears from now until the end of the season but you have made the last 8+ years so enjoyable so many great memories, will cherish every game with you as my manager, you will always be the perfect Liverpool boss and I’ll be telling my grandchild all about you, the best manager in the world, good luck at your new adventure ❤
No reason.
This news is so shocking, I'm sad and haven't moved on,  I understand his decision and will remember him as one of great coach that we had. Hopefully this rest of the season going to be good memories for all the fans.
Thank you for all the memories everything your legacy will be a part of Liverpool FC forever   Thank you Legend 😢
Mad respect! 👏 /Arsenal-fan.
I love Jurgen so much. He is a genius coach, but everyone goes, but Liverpool is always there. In our hearts ❤️
I’m crying😢😢😢 I love u klop
Even as a Manchester United fan, this makes me to feel very sad. I really love this guy. My favorite coach before and after Liverpool. I would have loved see to him at Manchester United instead of Liverpool. As a football fan, thank you for all the great games, wish you all the best now and in the future, whereever that may be.
😭😭😭😭😭😭   You don't know how much pain every Liverpool fan is going through.    Klopp don't leave ...humble request ... Take break and come again
What a man! Thank you so much for your dedication and explanation. I can understand your reason clearly. To be honest that's your 'energy' that make football live again in Liverpool. If that energy has gone. Football itself would gone. Danke 🙏
Even As a united fan seeing this man leave is so sad😢😭
😢😢😢
We will miss you Boss! Liverpool will not be the same without you! Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Kenny Daglish and JURGEN KLOPP!
🫶🏻
YNWA Jurgen 😢❤❤
Norwich fan in peace. What a brilliant manager he’s been for Liverpool, but he’s a quality person. Fair play to him for having the balls to give up a top top job to enjoy the rest of his life. Clearly there’s things on his bucket list he wants to do and can’t do because he’s 1000% committed to Liverpool
you can't top this one. he will be back but i am sure he will suprise the sports world once again
Please don't go!
Don't Cry because it's over be happy because it happend ❤️‍🩹❤️
Kloppo! 🟥🟥🟥
I'm also crying. YNWA Klopp😢❤
Please make a statue of this legend ❤
Best in the world 😢
As a former Liverpool fan I completely understand and highly respect the man's decision, it is not easy to stop when everything is on top. RESPECT to you Mr Klopp your are not just looking to pocket the money but what's best overall. 👊
Not even a Liverpool fan but that hit hard
Look he is doing the best if he is running out of energy it means  he is leaving because of the respect 4 the fans and everyone
hopefully Liverpool gonna win the Premier League this season so he can leave the club with pride..👍
Its time to love himself more..Thank u klopp..
Greatest manager in the country after Fergie. He’s a fantastic manager and a fantastic guy! Achieved so much!!! He’s a world class manager and will be a premier league manager legend! Massive respect Klopp!!! YNWA
Thank you Mr Klopp for 9 years with us. Lots of memories and achievements. I know 1 day we need to accept that Jurgen Klopp will leave the club. In my generation you're Liverpool Greatest Manager.😢
Our greatest PL manager! The man who changed everything! From doubter to believer! Thank you herr Klopp! Another PL trophy and equaling with greatest rivals would be a great farewell present!
Thanks for everything Mister Jurgen Klopp ❤
klopp
I hope he takes over the german national team
What you did with Liverpool is amazing, you are a great manager, I wish you all the in life
From what I remember he signed a 3 year deal a year ago stating that as long as his wife is happy here he will stay, a year later he now says he’s leaving I know he wouldn’t throw his family or wife under the bus to the press but I think there is more to it then he’s telling the public anyway
I'm in shock since yesterday. Jürgen for me as a German is Liverpool FC. The best match you could ever imagine. I'm SC Freiburg fan and I compare it if Christian Streich would leave it would be the same tragedy! World stops turning and you feel a depressed mood. I wish all Liverpool Fans all the best and a good new manager. Love from Germany <3
Sir alex left n nobody cried..but klopp left n everyone emotional. Just to show how powerful klopp is
Bruh why this is the best manager he got us right back on track if it’s money they better give him it  smh smh smh smh smh
BIG RESPECT for Klopp! What a great manager and man,I like the way he's done this,class,and he obviously loves the club and fans,good luck in the future Jurgen 🎉
Thank u kloop!
Heartbroken but completely understand. Thank you Jurgen. <3
Klop is legend
Like if anyone cryed❤❤❤
Danke Jürgen...
Quitter
I’m running out of energy. Or. I’m board now and want a new challenge. If he was running out of energy he could just take a year off and come back. He won’t do that. He basically just wants a new challenge. I think he’ll be the Madrid manager
Хоть меня не кто и не поймёт но пусть вы выйграйте трэбл в конце Юргена Клопа
Oh, Jurgen.  It's his decision that needs to be made, but I think it would be great that if we wrap up this fairy tale, then at the end of next season. The team is great, next season we set a goal for ourselves to win the Champions League, because for such a coach and such a team, one trophy is not enough. + you could watch Alonso and his Bayer in the Champions League and see which Xabi coach is on the "distance". That would be great. so read the comment and change your mind) We are all waiting for the 7th Champions League
He’s a class act!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
lad, 30 years hes been with us, absolute legend. goodbye jurgen, thank you for everything. managed us a 7-0 win to man utd, seven nil is crazy, i cant thank you enough for what you’ve done for the club.
Not a Liverpool fan but I have always thought of him as a great manager, leader, person. Much respect and i hope Liv fans can accept his decision.
I bet fenway is one of the key reasons for klopp's leaving
Refused to believe it until he was truly gone.. still hoping he will changes his mind at the end of season..
กุลซือคนที่จะมาแท่นที่คนต่อไป คือ โจเซ มูรินโญ่ 🎉
*falsche Haare, falsche Zähne*
What can I say big sadness
Klopp first inerview as Liverpool Manager in 2015 '' it's not so important what people think when you come in, It's much more important what people think when you leave'' and you left a legacy.
Simply the best ! All the best to you in your next journey. Thanks so much for everything you did for the club
Thank you Klop, you are the best manager in the world
Thank you for turning us all into believer's again Jurgen, we all wish you well for the future
Thank you for everything jorgen klop😢😢 greetings from indonesia
There will never be another coach like Klopp! 😢 the thank you at the end got me. Thank You Jurgen!
Two words for you, my friend; "Take care". I love you, rockstar.
Choking up, watching this. If ever a man was right for Liverpool this man was. It hurts deeply, but completely respect his decision. Got to get through the weekend and enjoy what time we have left. Maybe years down the road he would be open to coming back. live in hope and all that.
He has given everything to this club and the man needs a break. I respect him so much. Its a sad moment but what a man. Everyone needs to learn from his message but men in particular need to hear no matter what it looks like on the outside, burnout and your own mental health is important. Look after yourself. YNWA Jurgen.
A sad day for Liverpool but we have to respect his decision. Amazing manager. Hopefully we can win the Premier League this season.
I completely understand his decision. He's given so much to the team, the club and to us the supporters. Now his tank is empty and he needs to rest. It was a very wise decision to tell us early. Respect for that and for everything he has done for us. He's like a Dad to all of us and it's taken its toll on him. Enjoy your normal life after football Jurgen. You've definitely earned it. And you will never walk alone.
Respect Klopp.
16:54 ❤
Fair play Jurgen. Will be sad to see you leave but when it’s time it’s time. You’ve more than earned it. Now let’s get that league title for a proper farewell party!
Wants out as knows to make Liverpool champs or maintain top 4 minimum  it needs new overhaull and he aint got the drive or patience to do it and he wants to go out on a high not taking the club backwards. Fergie did a rebuild twice it takes a lot 20 years commitment. Like he said could of been sacked at one stage last season and he cant ever risk that on his record next season. He knows clubs like Newcastle Villa Spurs  etc are now a threat to the usual top 4 gurantee of City Arsenal Liverpool and United/ Chelsea. Like he said he cant do it
The Normal One The Legend❤❤❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Great manager and a good man..
When he said, no other club in England because of the love for the club and the people, tanked tears started rolling out, once in a lifetime person, thanks for everything Klopp, you are more than a football manager
Klopp you were the most underrated manager in our eyes, you made us win every trophy possible and you made us really happy, we will miss you punching the sky after a win, and you joking about in the press confrences, May you be YNWA till you die.
Thank you, Klopp. Thanks for bring Liverpool giant again❤
Dam!! I'm not a Liverpool fan and it's gutting to see him leave.  Something about klopp that's special about him being in this league,   You can tell he doesn't want to leave but something is telling him, it's his time.   Good luck klopp,
Thats a great manager and even better person. From a newcastle fan.
FunFact. It took Klopp 4 years to win the CL at Liverpool.                 It took Tuchel 4 months to win the CL at Chelsea.
I’m a grown man, 23 years old, and I’ve tears running down my face man.   Thank you for the memories, Jurgen❤️
Schön das ein Trainer nach langer Zeit nach gut gemachter Arbeit als eine mächtige Erinnerung davon geht .Er ist und bleibt eine Liverpool Legende. Tolle Leistung, geile Zeit .Vielen dank als Fußball Fan
Omg cant believe it he is best manager,jurgen dont leave us❤
Dear Jürgen Norbert Klopp, I was unable to respond to the publications or like the posts, as I was very upset and cried a lot over this news, but I come here to say my greatest feelings as a Liverpool fan to you, Klopp. You arrived in 2015, the year that I began my passion for Liverpool Football Club, and you not only changed the history of the club, but also my life, over the years, you transformed this club, not just as a team that We cheer and then forget, but yes, like our family, win or lose, we all made our day just by watching you and the beloved Reds play, I'll never forget, the jokes, the laughs, and the moments that always left me so much I, Like Everyone In The Fans In A Moment Of High Happiness... At This Current Moment, We Are Sad With His Leaving, To Be Honestly, I Would Even Accept That He Became To Some Team, Because That Way We Knew He Was Well And Doing What He Loves Most , which is working with football, but we are happy that you were part of not only our team, the Reds, but also the other teams that you also coached during your career. Know Jürgen, We Will Never Forget You, You Went From A Coach To A Member Of Our Family, I Always Wake Up To Accompany You And The Entire Team, Here In Brazil, Where I Live, And Know That, One Of The Greatest Legends Of A Sport What happened on this Earth, today he is a big fan of yours as well as a passionate about Liverpool, Klopp, a big hug from your big fan Paulo Henrique Vieira, who talks about Brazil, I hope one day I can meet and watch a Reds match and that you Be There With Us Always, As A Great Supporter And More Than A Legend And Yes, A Forever Member Of Our Family, Thank You Boss, Even With Your Difficulties, You Continue To Train Our Team, Yes And Love, That Goes Beyond of Football, No Matter The Next Results You Saw, This Will Never and Will Never Change How We Feel About You, Know That You Will Never, Never Walk Alone... We Love You Boss - YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE ❤️
Is he doing this to make tje players motivated to winbit one last time for him😅
I'm celtic fan but that's sad but he is sound guy and honest guy doin it this way..   I've always said ANGE SHOULD STAYED CELTIC ANOTHER YEAR OR 2 CAUSE HE SUPPORTS LIVERPOOL AND ID LOVED SEEN HIM AFTER KLOPP CAUSE TEAM IS THERE PLAY THAT STYLE AND WOULD BEEN MASSIVE SUCCUSS I BELIEVE ..    Jurgen has been great for Liverpool but managers do have self life apart from some exceptions in past . But he has done just about everything there is at Liverpool and I was worried there thought at 1st was ill.. but he said he isn't thank god .  Wish him all best  been character in that league likeable guy compared to robots that are in management these days ..  godbless Jurgen  wish well m8
Thank you for everything, Jürgen. It was a pleasure, u are heart of the club ❤
I'm a life long Man United fan.   Mr Klopp is a terrific manager, but more than this - a terrific person. He brought greatness back to Liverpool, and I don't just mean trophies. I mean class, honour, playing and living the right way. His teams echoed this on and off the field. I personally think that he should have taken a break rather than leave - but what I think on that is only one view, and not one that matters. While for much of his tenure, my club has been in the doldrums, but not for Liverpool FC.   And in his tenure, he found, enjoyed, embraced the people and the city - and they - him. His time, his experience - and that of the Liverpool fans will in the near future, role into a period of excellence, regeneration, victories, and fond memories. He will be a very hard act to follow.  As a bystander, or as simply a football fan - I have enjoyed the football played, in the right spirit and the words and deeds of the man in his time. He will be sadly missed and I wish it were not so. To the fans, salute the man down the stretch and give him a send of he deserves, and enjoy the moments. They will I am sure be special.   It will be our loss to not clash swords in the future with the man, and I acknowledge it fully. To the man, the club, the team and the city - best wishes for the future. I will miss you sir.
Jurgen Klopp's departure is bad news for the entire PL. He brings a warmth and humanity in stark contrast to the businessmen that are wringing the game for every penny and want to turn it into the football equivalent of the NFL. He's honest, charming, funny and relateable. There's images of him driving into work in an Opel Kadet! he will be missed that's for sure.
Bring in xabi alonso
Heartbroken
Sad even for supporters of other clubs. Really lovable man. He has been quiet and subdued of late though
Klopp has been best signing of  liverpool. ..best coach, and more importantly a honest human being... I K ew this will happen...there are so many  good things about you... You will always be in my heart... All the very best normal one.. Or I should say the honest one. 😊
There is definitely something happened and I wish him, his family the absolutely best. I am not a Liverpool fan, I am not watching the football for years now but I respect him a lot. What an incredible man, so open and honest.
this guy made liverpool the club it is today one of the best coaches in the world and the best in club liverpool's history have a good one jurgen ! danke,jurgen ❤️💯
Bayern munchen 2025.
Still can’t get my head around it. Watched this interview so many times already 😢 wish you nothing but the best for the future Jurgen. You sir will never walk alone. YNWA❤
That is the day I've been scared of since he came here
😢Jurgen klopp
12:30 kick offs killed him
What a lovely MAN.  😥
Herr klopp, für mich sind sie - in all ihren facetten als mensch gesehen - der größte trainer aller zeiten. Man kann einen solchen schritt nicht besser erklären, das versteht jeder mensch. Ich wünsche ihnen und ihrem verein heuer noch den sieg in allen bewerben, in denen sie dabei sind. Dem menschen jürgen klopp wünsche ich eine wunderschöne zeit abseits des trubels, sie haben es sich schwerstens verdient! Und noch eine, nein zwei bitten: sollten sie in zukunft doch wieder einmal lust auf den trainerjob bekommen: bitte niemals madrid oder bayern. Alles gute ihnen und ihrer familie!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Am a united fan but this is so touching for me. This man is huge, the history he set at Liverpool so huge, he made this  club so huge once again,  and this interview is mind-blowing to me to be honest. One of the greatest coach in the past 2 decades. Well done Jurgen and I wish you all best in your next level. But the  English premiere league will miss for ever. 😭😭😭👏👋.  I never expected this at this moment.
Why are you going I want you Do stay at Liverpool 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Great work Jurgen, you're influence reaches far and wide.
Think this man has offered his all and needs something back for himself and his family. I'm not an LFC fan, think  English football will miss him, his knowledge and his honesty.   Good on you Sir. Go live your life.
if liverpool signs mbappe he will stay
Jurgen😢
11:52 1- it’s not unfortunately to be at that job for 24 years 🌹 2- we are not the same we keep changing then we do the job much better  3- if you couldn’t find your new purpose within your old one then you gonna probably return back to your old one( propuse not separated from the work ,  4- people are the best thing in life , you have the best chance to see live within your fans  5- please remember how it’s went with Zidan when he came back to Madrid after his resignation  6- better to rest hard when your energy runs out ( that doesn’t need to stop the job)  7-There is nothing wrong with clearly demanding a promotion at the club    Loving you , your fan
This will cause ripples to the team and playing style. Years of mid table finishes coming up 😢
Danke Jürgen Thank You Cheef Klopp..Hiányozni fogsz!
gonna miss you Jurgen Klopp stay pls we will never walk alone with out you ur the good manger love you and thanks😭😭😭
Klopp is one of the great managers in the PL era. As a United fan I hated to see our team against him and would have loved to see him in Old Trafford as a manager. His passion is what fans want. Wish best for his future. Can't wait to see Liverpool in muds again.
We’re stuffed no coach will understand liverpools culture like klopp.
Im sad but I respect the decision
💔 heart broken, but respect your decision Jurgen. Wish you the best! And thankyou for your time with Liverpool
❤️👏
So proud of our gaffer and relish who's next all I can do is wish him the best.
Omg Pls nooo Liverpool can’t have been on this place without you
LEGEND ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
me on Monday to my boss: I cant do this job  again and again and again
i am not any team fans, so i can enjoy any teams to play good football. Klopp's liverpool is the one of the best team in PL history without a doubt . all the best to Klopp. i understand what you feel what you lose in energy. we are all human , what is the purpose of life is the key. there are so many ways to live, and to identify what is the purpose of life, if money is not any concern , to make you happy may be no need to get satisfy work. you can make yourself happy from normal life , normal life with more time for personal interest and more time with family ....all the best Klopp
Alonso is the best candidate to take the reigns
Cinabit
Obrigado por tudo Klopp q Deus te acompanhe sempre amém 🙏🏽  \o/ YNWA \o/
A Giant amongst men, not only as a football coach but as a man, we should all take a leaf out of his book, honest and with integrity….love this guy 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Klopp will be missed but as a Chelsea fan I still have to respect the man
We ❤❤❤❤ you dad klopp 😢
Crack forever
Thank you for everything, Jurgen. Your legacy at Liverpool will be forever remembered. Now lets win the title and give him a massive farewell.
Thank you Jurgen. For everything ❤
next England manager 2025
He hit the wall, which is normal and people bounce back from it. I would not call it depression, but he needs time off from football to re charge.
Aduh 😭
14:00 There it is "I've been doing the job for 24 years and I want to see what life is like"
Was in tears yesterday. Unbearable to hear the news knowing that one of our best or our best manager is leaving. We need to win the quad for kloppo ❤
What a manager you have been. Let's end the season strong ❤
😢
It speaks to both the legacy of this man as well as the passion felt for him by all the fans that the Like/Dislike ratio is so pure considering the nature of this news!  A true legend.
Walk on through the rain
What a beautiful man. Unique. Not just in football but from his approach to people & life in general.  Quite rightly stands shoulder to shoulder with Shankly, Paisley & Dalglish.  This moment had to come due to his full throttle approach. Much as we think he is superhuman he isn’t.  Thank you Jürgen, go & spread your magic in other areas of your life, especially your family. The loss of your mother must have been such a wake up call.  Always know that Liverpool supporters will always have your back & be cheering you on in whatever challenge you take on next.  Gutted but pleased that you have the insight & bravery to make  one of the toughest decisions of his life but for once is putting himself & his family first. Sums of the man perfectly.
City fan here boy in gonna miss the klopp pep rivalry...one of the best ever..great manager klopp
We would love to see you leading Brazil to the next World Cup !
nothing but respect for Jurgen, you cannot argue with his style, energy and enthusiasm for the game whoever you support!! 100% one of the best mangers to ever manage within the game.. Respect and good luck in the future from a Forest fan..
Wishing you all the best Jurgen, you have given me the worst footballing days of my entire life as a Man Utd fan seeing my team getting smashed at both grounds in recent seasons. But life is infinitely more important than football, always has been. Go live life with your wife and kids while time is there to do so. Pretty sure the city of Liverpool have long taken you into their hearts and will understand your decision to leave. Godspeed🛫
I'll never forget what he has done for Liverpool he's the GOAT for sure and always will be. We will miss him as our manager wish him the best. Let's smash the rest of the season out for this man CMONNNN YOU REDS!!!!!!!!!!🔴🔴🔴💯
Klopp's impact on Liverpool will always be remembered. His passion, dedication, and love for the club were truly remarkable. Thank you for everything, Jurgen Klopp. You will always be a legend in our hearts.
Jurgen looks tired , his voice doesnt carry the strength of years gone by , I know he's older but even so its clear that the pressure of managing such a huge club has taken its toll. He has to do whats right for him and his family.
Soft landing, lengser keprabon madeg pandito. Matursuwun Pak Klopp. 🙏🏼
You are always in my heart, jurgen klopp. YNWA 😢❤
Jürgen, we thank you for all you have done, respect your wishes and hope for your health and happiness in the future  Let's finish strong 💪
sometimes we all have to be honest with ourselves like him. let there be a lesson for all of us humans our inside feelings
kamu kok gitu pak kloop:(
I love how Kloop mentions he needs to talk to Daire the young boy who like us must be crying now.  He  really is the best of us.  We will miss him!
Im not crying!.... actually I am...I am crying... massively
FFP has them all jumping ship before they are pushed 🍿
i am not a Liverpool supporter but I respect this human being is amazing and truthful! he is still a human and need to enjoy his life
클롭 감독님 그동안 정말 수고많으셨어요 당신이 그리울겁니다 제라드가 떠날때 만큼 가슴아픕니다  감독님의 건승을 기원합니다
As in Mainz and Dortmund before, Jurgen will leave tears behind
Et tu Juergen?!?!?!
It's so sad seeing someone leaving even though he is doing a great job! Imagine how exhausted Jurgen is to leave a club he loves so much and brings these results.
I am tired to play 5 seasons in Football Manager 😂 Imagine 24 years in real world!
Legend 👑
Sincerely, I'll miss you sir.   The commitment, the positive mindset, the pattern, everything... You're simply the best sir 💗
omg
Anybody else who shed a tear listening to this? 😢
why i bet were dead
Could've announced it in a few months ngl
NO OTHER manager is loved and respected by the Fans, Players, journalist, and Rivals.
Boossss😭😭😭😭😭
That's the highest class of being trainer and a human
:(
Welcome back, Xabi!
Thank you Jurgen for being the best coach, father, person and supporter of all we do as Liverpoolians   YNWA…   You’d never be forgotten!!!  🫶🏼🫶🏼
It fucking sucks that he's leaving but it's better that he still does the job with some energy and then goes on his own terms thats all you can ask in the situation
The integrity is what i love  our hearts bleed and tears will fall, this hits hard.
Sounds strange but I saw this coming
NOOOOOOOOOOOO......
Take a year off.... And come back to Liverpool in 2025
The man gave his all... A managerial life well spent.   He will walk off into the sunset with a smile on his face.   Nothing but respect. 🤘🏾 Rock on JK!
Nh i m crying😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
As a German, I can say Klopp looks tired. He must have given everything for you. Even though I wasn't very interested in football, I was happy that you were a big football family. Klopp also has great admirers here in Germany. I wish him all the best
est manger in the world we need u its combind 13pls dont leave😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 u are the  manger we had.we are combind 13  we have 11 player and we have anfield and most important we have you
What a man. True gent, wish him and his family all the very best ❤
As a Dortmund fan, I know the feeling of losing Jürgen Klopp as a coach. I hope liverpool manage the time after him better than we are currently doing.
He and Pep have made the Premier League even more interesting. I never cared about managers at all before they arrived, but suddenly, watching their reactions when their teams score has become its own entertainment for me.
Man city fan here in peace. I genuinely think he doesn't look well at the moment.
He is hoping to leave after winning the Prem. His name will be linked to a couple of famous Liverpool managers of the past.
One of the best coach ever
I wanna try and speak for all spurs fans and say farewell legend. We had our lil back and forth earlier in the season but we know now that there was other stuff you were dealing with. Nothing but respect for this man 🤍
DANKE JURGEN 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We are liverpool, this means more
Even as a man utd supporter, Ive got to show respect. This guy is an absolute legend for liverpool and led his team to glory
That right there is true leadership and love. All the respect in the world to this amazing man. Take your time to enjoy life and then come home to Stuttgart, Kloppo! ❤
😢😢😭😭
Liverpool to become the new Man United…just imagine on sky seeing Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher arguing over who is the worst 😂😂😂
😢😢😢
love you Kloppo, you are such an icon ! It was hard after you left dortmund but It was also so beautiful to see your process and your path and especially your human nature ! wishing you all the best ! 💚
Thank you Mr Jurgen Klopp, you have brought me joy over the years, I'm so proud to be a LFC fan,   There was a time I thought I'd never see LFC lift the BPL in my lifetime, but you changed all that and made us triumph over manure and leave them way below us, they're not our match now, thanks to you  Ynwa dear sir, have a great time riding in the sunset,
Jurgen is such a L
He is getting out of the stress this country just whats u dead
Kloppo, du bist der Beste! Genieß' die Pause, ich hoffe du findest was du suchst :)
You will never walk alone Klopp and thanks for everything brought to the club . You will leave a special place in all lfc supporter hearts always. Good luck and stay healthy  abd happy❤
Whatever manager comes in now we need to get behind. Let's not turn into a Man U post Sir Alex, that would be more devastating than coming out of this season trophy less. We all knew that in 2024 there  was a chance Klopp would be gone it just came faster than anyone realized.
Legend 👊🏾
He may just be the most loved German in england ever 🇬🇧 ❤🇩🇪
A couple of years before he joined I told one of my friends that Klopp would be the perfect fit for Liverpool. Purely on the similarities between Dortmund and Liverpool. I had no idea back then just how right I was. He’s breathed life and a character into this club which had been missing for so long. I had so much joy watching this man manage my club. Thank you for everything Jurgen. Hopefully we will see you again sometime. YNWA.
Klopp the best manager in the world
I watched this yesterday at around 2pm but till now I don't feel the same thank you so much boss we appreciate your work and we feel you can't be replaced because you mean a lot to the club and to the football world THANK YOU SO MUCH
Love you Jürgen, ❤
Good time to go I think . He’s give it 100 % good luck to him and his family
I became a diehard fan of Liverpool especially cos of Klopp and Mo Salah.. He will always be loved and remembered ❤❤❤
This couldbe Steven Gerrard's time, Steven Foster assistant. He's done his apprenticeship and is a legend with the fans.
Why you leave us. Its a hard moment
😭😭🥺🥺🥺
Let him take a break. Maybe he thinks it is time for him to rest from football world. Just respect his decision. Thank you very much Mr. Jurgen Klopp for your effort, to make Liverpool as it is, right now. 😀
I woke up in the afternoon yesterday to the worst news possible. Man, I love and respect this legend so much. The biggest asset of Liverpool FC. One day I hope to meet him and shake his hand and say thank you for everything Jurgen❤
As a Man u fan. I'm sad he's going. Brilliant manager. He's been great for the premiere league. Can't think of him putting a foot wrong and always respectful of his rivals.
This really is a heartbreaking moment, 9 years in Liverpool and now...
The master of the correct moment and the correct words….i am proud of this german man in a foreign but lovely country (said as a German citizen)
Eine Legende geht...Ich wünsche Jürgen Klopp alles Gute für die Zukunft und verneige mich mit Respekt, ziehe meinen Hut und bedanke mich für die wundervollen Jahre...Es sei dir gegönnt, dein Leben zu leben, du hast es dir mehr als verdient
I don’t support Liverpool but I’m a big fan of jurgen klopp Liverpool fans will miss you but there is much more important things like your family and friends  Jurgen klopp you have brang so much happiness to Liverpool fans so they should treat with upmost respect and gratitude in your final season 🫡
Danke Jurgen. YNWA.
Just fight to win everything this season
Can't believe this. Shock
Thank you for every thing klopp You'll never walk alone❤❤❤
Sounds like he’s had a phone call with Florentino Perez. Wait and see on this one.  Ancelotti got a 2 year contract extension recently which should work out very nicely indeed.
Big Man!
Though I am a City fan, I really respect this man - the passion, dedication, courage he brought in English football along Pep introduced new era of England's modern football.  Best wishes for you Jk, history will remember you for your contribution to Dortmund and Liverpool for sure!!
Respekt Jürgen, meine Hochachtung. Sehr bewegend. Du bist und bleibst ein "normal one", obgleich Dein Leben alles andere als normal war. Möge Dein weiterer Lebensweg ebenso "NORMAL" verlaufen. Ich wünsche Dir nur das ALLERBESTE. Du hast es verdient!!!!!⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
Joq ❤ 🇰🇿
Yesterday was my birthday and this broke my heart. Damn💔
😢😢😢
He definitely will be missed, the man was pure comedy. I need a compilation of Klopp's funniest moments.
More clarification on around @17:30-19 would be great. Don't want to wait for a year or so to know what really happens.  He needs to leave now and nobody would sack him so..... He's not the right person for now and the future........ What's all that about?.
One of the greatest in the world, I was shocked when I heard the news Klopp built this club and won everything with us. You always be a legend  YNWA❤ ALL THE BEST TO KLOPP
I think he will join DFB after Euro 24
Top manager
As a BVB fan, I can absolutely understand how Liverpool fans feel.😢 I believe that Xabi Alonso will be the new coach. Then Leverkusen will mourn...
Why klopp ? Why are you leaving us now that we are enjoying you, you break my heart and make me cry but we have to respect your decision.
There's always a time when a manager  should call time I would rather see him go on his term's than get the sack he will go down as one of the Liverpool greats .
🥹🥹🥲🥲😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you Jurgen. ❤ Alonso welcome!
I’m still confused why is he leaving????!
The levels of sadness is unreal I’ve have never felt so sad about football 😢
“Its not important what people think when you come in. Its much more important what people think when you leave”  - Jurgen Klopp -
My Beloved Coach, Mentor, Am 😔😢😫😭
I know that he will leave liverpool one day maybe after salah and virgil end their career but i didn't expect him to leave to soon.I still respect his decision.YNWA thank you klopp, definetly you deserve a statue at anfield 😢❤
Dankeschön Jürgen für alles hoffe du gewinnst noch die Meisterschaft mit Liverpool
I feel like I’m going through a divorce 😪
It still doesn't feel real. Worst day of my life 💔
Klopp will be forever in our hearts 😢
As a Real Madrid Fan Jurgen Klopp Is The Best Manager How he Build Liverpool Goodbye :loudly_crying_face
we love you Jurgen❤❤❤
Noooo not kloppo 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭 💔💔💔💔💔
Kloppo, alles alles gute für den Rest der Saison. Für den Rest deines Lebens mit deiner Familie.   Du bist, warst und wirst immer ein ganz besonderer "normaler" Typ sein.  Ich wünsche dir nur das Beste, es wird nie wieder so einen Trainer geben. Danke für 16 Jahren volle Pulle.  Grüße aus Oberfranken eines BVB Fans.
By NO MEANS am I wishing this or anything, but Klopp strikes me as a guy that will hide an underlying life threatening illness to not distract his players' focus and for the betterment of a football club.  The reason I say this is because of the phrases he's using...  "I am running out of energy".  "I wont be able to perform as I have in the future".  "It would be really cool if you just accept my decision as the right one".  I even read how he invited Sven Goran Eriksson (who was recently diagnosed with an illness?) to visit Lpool club.  I pray pray pray this is not the case (and it is HIGHLY likely it's not) and think this is just me  being hurt and overthinking things.  Jurgen Norbert Klopp, thank you for all the memories sir 🙏  May YNWA and may the most high bless you and your family❤  Liverpool Football Club (and supporters)....WE MOVE!!!
日本の選手を、起用してくれて、ありがとうございます😂。🇩🇪🇯🇵 私は🇩🇪大好きです😍。 ブンデスリーガも。
Can't hardly wait until he's gone
Part of the reason he doesn't have the same energy is because he knows he won't get the financial backing he needs from Liverpool to compete with Man City.
Its gonna be hard finding a manager better than Jürgen Klopp
Sad day😢😢
I hope i meet kloppo in person. Just watch all LFC games over some beer,  and just study him as a human. Its been a real Honor.
감사합니다 행복했습니다
Good human being   , no arrogance ....Just passion ....As a united fan ,man ths guy ws a legend!
KUDOOS🎉🎉 HE IS A WINNER 🏆 🥇
Never knew i would be crying for a 56 year old german with beard. 😢
Xabi Alonso will make Liverpool invincible.
Liverpool Will be fijne witte a decent manager. Klopp hasn't evolved
Well be miss you Jurgen klopp😢
" I have run out of energy", yeah and run out of idea's on how to get closer as a manager to Pep, it must be gutting for Klipperty to be at the top of his game and still be 2nd best. BMR.
We will love you klop in our Hearts
I love you , Boss . You are amazing . Thank you ❤
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na hey hey hey good bye 😢
😢😢😢😢
YNWA Jurgen. A sad day indeed
Klopp...😢
We will miss him ❤
I am a Liverpool fan from 90s, started when I saw Steve McManaman at Liverpool. From that moment I really love this club. I am also a fan of Dortmund. We all knew what Klopp did for Dortmund. When Klopp signed for Liverpool Manager, I knew that Klopp is for the Kop and that's true. Klopp had won every major title (EPL, FA, EFL, UCL, etc) except Europa League. This is the time that everything will be possible. Thank you Klopp. Danke.
What a handsome German man he is as well. Imagine if it was WWII. He would look great in that all black uniform 😉
You will never be forgotten
How can you not love this guy?
so much love and respect
Thank you, Jürgen! We appreciate you and will always remember you. There are no irreplaceable, but there are unique. You are a unique, charismatic genius!
Thank u for everything klopp bye😔😔😔😭😭😭😭😭😭 im actually crying😢😢😢
Liverpool will struggle to replace him 🤣
as a LFC fans since i was 15years old now iam 38, its sad, but this is the way how its should end, retired once you are on the TOP like KHABIB NURMAGOMEDOV with fatastic record history.... we will miss you from MALAYSIA...
DANKE, KLOPPO! Immer ehrlich, und ganzer Einsatz bis zuletzt. Heartbreaking, but everyone can and will understand…respect….WE ARE LIVERPOOL❤.
Quitting while your ahead is not the same as quitting 😉😅😎
Klopp, You saved Liverpool in 2015 and kept your promises. We will truly truly miss you Jürgen Klopp, The best manager Liverpool has ever seen…
Very emotional interview,  i had tears in my eyes. Jurgen spoke really well true to himself & the fans. He's an absolute Legend at the club & rightly so, statue, name on the stand take your pick. Good luck to him & thanks for all the entertainment & passion he drove into the players to perform at the highest level Thankyou ❤ The players always perform for him we already know that but i do think i have noticed a significant level of performance from them especially if they have known this from November? Uefa cup to finish the collection off & definitely the Premier league infront of the Kop come May. Who knows maybe a treble or a quad you never know, all we do know is that they will give there all for him 100%👊👌
Klopp, if you can rest, we are waiting for you in Madrid, such a professional coach would be in a very good position at the head of Real Madrid. Great respect for the results achieved in Dortmund and Liverpool, I think and many people think that the best coach in the world is the number one Jurgen Klopp.
Apakah dia mau melatih timnas Jerman atau inggris
Noooooo
I'm so sad 😭 to see him go but he will forever go down as a legend of Liverpool. Klopp ur an amazing lad and an amazing manager 🙏🏻 and we Liverpool fans are blessed that ucame to this amazing club and stayed thru all these years.
Build this man a statue! He loves this club so much! He puts Liverpool FC in front of his own self, understanding his abilities and willing to break this relationship for this club's better future. It hurts so much to see him leave, but I'd rather see Jurgen Klopp leave like this, than in any other way. What a man, and what a role model. To many of us, he wasn't just a manager of the club we love so much, he was a father figure that we never had. I will forever love and cherish the impact he made on our Liverpool family! YNWA! ❤
My wife said why u upset managers come & go, said wife’s come & go then
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ JK .   YNWA.......
Beauttah Tsuma:Kenya- Thank you for the love you had for Lfc. Your great achievement with Lfv. But above all, your Love for Jesus Christ, the saviour of man.
😭 please dont go
thank you boss
I'll love you forever ❤️
😭😭😭 ynwa Jurgen
Only man in life has been my amazing dad and then you came and been like a father too. After I heard the news, I was heartbroken and woke up this morning feeling sad but kudos for being vulnerable and just being honest with us. More reason to love you more. My dad has spoken to me about the glory days in the 70s and 80s but never knew what it felt like, when you came and showed the meaning of it all. All the best Jurgen and leave winning it all. ❤ YNWA
Imagine if he had all the funds and budgets like other big teams to use and spend, this guy would even be more unstoppable.
GOAT Jurgen Klopp
All good things come to an end. Mr. Klopp, thank you so much for your devotion and love for this team.
thanks for your services boss, you will forever be remembered
I wonder if theres another underlying issue and theyre just saying hes running out of energy to not get the fans on the clubs back. We shall see how quick he gets back into management
" WE ARE LIVERPOOL"  that line right at the finish, got me shouting. THIS MEANS MORE.
We will miss you klopp ❤
I am not a liverpool supporter but I will miss him
Thank you Jürgen. Best Manager of Liverpool. we will miss you.
Really appreciate Jurgen klopp  for his time at Liverpool and the EPL even as a rival fan. All the best Jurgen!!
ขอบคุณมากที่ทำทุกอย่างให้สโมสรแห่งนี้ jk
So many flashbacks now, thanks for everything Jurgen!
what a man, my love respect and awe for Jurgen continues to proliferate, thank you for everything YNWA.
Top bloke will miss this gaffer
It's relentless being a manager
Just wishful thinking...   Come manage the Zambian national team , we have a lot of 😂of tourist attractions.   At least you will be coaching another of my favorites teams.
Get the statue ready 🔴👑🔴
There is only one Jürgen Klopp. Danke maestro.
His health isn't supportive to energy level needed for him and LFC. Healthcomesfirst. Hope you get better soon.
Thank you Klopp 🙏🏾
If your not the right one for the future who is ?? Definitely not Gerrard noooooooooooooooooooo
I’ve never felt like I do now when anyone else has left the club, 😢😢
I did not think 🤔 this would come this soon... As it is, there's no Manager who would fit in the shoes he is leaving behind, maybe Pep Guadiola... Otherwise, next season will be tough.   JURGEN worked out a system which gave us competition on every front even with little money. All the best Klopp. I personally will forever miss seeing you on the Anifield Turth.   YWNA
次に何をやるにしても応援したくなる人物。 今まで本当にお疲れ様でした。  そして日本人として、遠藤を仲間に入れてくれて、活躍の場を与えてくれてありがとう！
As an Everton supporter iv been drilled to hate everything about Liverpool FC. However, for some strange reason I really like Klopp. This interview just confirmed why.
I started crying as soon as I heard the news. I hope we will be together for 12 years.❤🙏
Not a Liverpool fan but I'd like to extend my thanks to Jurgen for all the years of beautiful football, passion for football, entertaining interviews and everything else he has blessed us with. Top manager and from, admittedly, what little I have seen off the pitch a generally nice person. Thanks you and good luck with everything you do next.
Thank U
Stevie G to take over!!
Change is inevitable I only ever cried one time before when Dalglish left celtic and went to Liverpool but this is left me a lump in my throat I learned the change lesson early on in life .
Its sad Klopp is leaving, he has done so much for the club in the past years and accomplished a lot of great success. Lets all support his decision and enjoy the last games with Klopp as manager.
I'm shocked and devastated about this, but I completely understand his decision. We will always cherish your contribution to this great club, one of the best managers not only at our club, but all around the world true. A true leader among the people but at the same time a proper, caring and loving human being. We will miss you Jurgen Norbert Klopp YNWA😢❤
Running out of Energy 😂🤣😂.  Bit of a excuse?  lets see what clubs hes at in 5 years lol
This guy will be back
🙏 don't leave
Danke für deine Zeit
Thankyou klopp you have giving me great memories and I hope you can win the quad for an amazing send off ❤
Nothing lasts forever
You can see the stress and drain in his face ynwa ynwa ynwa
لكل مشجعين ليفربول تذكرو هالكلام سوف نرجع نهاية الموسم على تحقيق الدوري وربما اخبار بخصوص كلوب لو بقى بصيص من بقاء كلوب سوف ابقى متمسك في هالبصيص يارب نهاية الموسم فرح لنا ياسكاوز YNWA ♥️
😢We will all miss you goodbye Klopp
Has recent events and conversations with arsene wenger any influence on jurgens decision?
😭😭End of an Era 😭
thank you JK
PGMOL behaviour behind Klopp's decision
Bring back Rafael benitize
Thanks coach, you the best in the world
Gotta respect how he made Liverpool a top tier team again .. brought the home the prem and much more .. Liverpool fans must give him a good send off
As a manu fan I have to say he’s a top manager and a top person. Never comes across as being self important or arrogant, just a really great guy and an excellent football person. Will be a loss to the prem league
Please I don't want Gerrard taken over noooooooooooooo . Alonso would of been great but I think he's been appointed at real Madrid so not many options available not Please Gérard not proven as a manager .
Manchester City will win the league this season, this is a blow to Liverpool title chances
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I'm so glad that Jurgen is a Red. I'm so glad he delivered what he said. Jurgen said to me, you know. We'll win the Premier League, you know. He said so. I'm in love with him and I feel fine.   I'm DEVASTATED now Jurgen...
In so many words klopp your burnt out I can understand that I wish you all the very best for the future ynwa respect to you and your service to Liverpool thank you for the good the bad and the ugly times lol .hail hail
😢Its because of PalWorld
Thank you for walking with Liverpool Klopp!
Klopp The Legend ❤  You’ll Never Walk Alone ❤️❤️❤️
Don’t go 💔😞
진짜 클롭덕분에 pl이 재밌긴했음. 진짜 없었으면 펩시티 독주였을텐데 전술도 펩이랑은 다른맛이고.
Liverpool won’t be the same without him. He was our leader. He understood us and we understood him. Whoever comes in has an impossible job on their hands!
im going to miss him so so much
he is more than just manager, he is our dad
You’l never walk alone
I have been dreaded about this day for like years, it's sad and hurt to see you go but i respect your decision jurgen. Hope that you have a good future ahead of you  YNWA ❤
Something has happened …
Welcome back Liverpool back to mid table come next season haha
😢😢
Thank you Jurgen, you will always be a Liverpool legend!

So it wasn't a bad dream, devastated.

클롭 감독님🌟🙏💝👍👍✨
I'm hurting. The pain of your departure cuts deep Jurgen.💔  In a world often void of fatherly figures, you embraced us with wisdom, warmth, and unwavering support. 🙏 You deserve all the good things in this world Jurgen. I pray God's light and favor upon you and your family's life. ❤
I cannot use the like button, even he deserves  it.
Oh the drama.
World Cup Winners 2030 Germany?
We have to win this seasons premier league 🥺
Thank you Jürgen. We are Liverpool. YNWA! We are LIVERPOOL!
The effect this man has had on this era of the premier league singlehandedly is incredible, wish you the best Jurgen!

Totally devastated. But a big thnxs to u Jurgen. U have made us a class above all club again.. The place where lfc belongs. Wish u all the very best in life and hopefully ynwa.
Respect
U will be missed klopp ❤❤
NAs a lifelong Ajax supporter since the legendary no. 14, J.C; RIP have I not appreciated a coach as much as Jürgen Klopp both in my home country or abroad. Not only a brilliant coach but also an exceptional person who shows a whole new level of humanity, both with his players without being a wuss, and with the fans and general public always accessible, open and respectful. All the best, good sir. Enjoy your retirement.
What a great guy and a great, we all will miss you Mister 💔
I wish you all the best in life klopp.. From a arsenal fan
100% class till the end. Does things the right way with honesty and integrity. YNWA
too bad my dad likes liverpool and i wonder who will be the new maneger for liverpool
100% class till the end. Does things the right way with honesty and integrity. YNWA
Please hire Xabi Alonso. Please
has he lost his mind he sounds bloody crazy
🥰🥰🥰❤️🧔🏼‍♂️❤️🥰🥰🥰
Thank you for every single moment. It was a beautiful journey.
People will appreciate him more YNWA
It will be different without him I can not see liverpool without him
Nah I will not accept this. YNWA
We will never forget you until the end of the world what a legend 😢
Who is the next manager???!! 🤔
Jurgen maaan Could've stayed for 1 more season 😢 Dearly Dearly missed
I am Man Utd fan from Bulgaria, but I am a fan that does not hate other clubs, I just support Man Utd when they play and I wanna watch good football. It is so strange that Klopp is leaving , he made such un impact not only for Liverpool , but for the Premier league. I feel sad, that is the truth. It is really bizarre. The feelings are similar to when Sir Alex retired. What I think is that Klopp is the most appreciated manager from the fans from other clubs.
Good morning. I do not support the team but personally I believe that the coach is among the twenty best of all time in world football. A person with morals and respect for opponents.  I wish him every success in his work and may he and his family always be healthy. Christos from Greece.
you are our legends at My Liverpool FC 😢👍🏻👍🏻
so sad, but lets give to Klopp a big hand together when he leave end of this season.
2025, ayo coba aja Klopp challenge STY jadi manajer timnas Indo😂 malah jadi sakit beneran nanti 👀
Thank you, for everything, Jurgen. I have nothing else to say other than YNWA!
My heart was aching n i was also sick 2 my stomach when I heard tis.. its is truly a sad news coz Jurgen Klopp is irreplaceable.. im fearing the worst 4 Liverpool.. probably its back 2 mediocre EPL seasons after tis with Liverpool and welcomed with open arms by Man U , Totenham n Chelsea.. tis is a disaster.
ynwa❤
Jürgen, as a manager, a gentleman, and all-round human being, you will always be held as one of the GREATEST MEN to have graced the game of football and Anfield Stadium.  I wish you all the best in whatever you do next. You will always be a GOD in the eyes of every Liverpool Fan.
Truly inspiring. Absolutely nothing wrong or "abnormal" (as Klopp himself put it it) in recognising when you are tired. A message lost in our always on hustle bro culture society. Take it from one of the best to do it. Thanks Jürgen
Far out those final few words to us fans. What a manager. What an orator. What a father. What a man.
just give him epl trophy plz🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Thank you very much Klopp for your contribution so far and respectful greetings from Indonesian Liverpool fans.
It’s like when your granddad announced to the family that he has cancer at stadium 4 😢
Departures...better to leave people wanting more than wanting less. Better to go out on a high than to hang around, begin to fail. and then be sacked.
In klopp we trust.. Thanks for a wonderful 9yrs. Let's finish the season strong and we all wish u the best for ur future. U will go down as a club great. ❤
Hopefully you miss us soon enough and come back *if* you find yourself bored with the regular normal life 😅 😭😭
It is hard to accept 😢, but it must all go well with you, JK. Wishing you the best ❤!
Wont be missed 👋
I ain’t crying, I’m representing a waterfall
So dont go away say what you say, say that you stay 🙏😭
We will mis you Klopp everything u have done for our club
Give the best mr.Klop..😢❤
My condolences to Liverpool  Mr Klopp, we're waiting for you in Crystal Palace )
Alles erdenkliche gute für diesen tollen Menschen und für mich besten Trainer. Sportlich weiterhin alles gute nach Liverpool ❤Liebe Grüße aus Mönchengladbach 🖤🤍💚
😢
He wanna go to lead German national team?
Danke Jürgen ❤
They call this "MIDLIFE CRISIS"
9:02 .Thank you for winning us Epl that we had not won before u'll always be in our heart .Thank you again its had to move on without you
Top manager and even classier human being. Nothing but admiration and respect to one of the most relatable, likeable, and fiercest competitors in the game who cares deeply for his club, city, fans, and player welfare. The PL as a whole will feel this one, for sure. Good luck in your next chapter.
Extremely sad day
An amazing manager, true legend. ❤
He said it from his heart when he said he need break , he run out of energy and when he said he want to life normal. Then i understand that decision. Enjoy your moment. Tq for everything jurgen. YNWA❤
😢😢😭😭😭
As an Arsenal fan am really disappointed with the news, I felt the same like Fergie and Arsen's retirement from football, Klopp was one of the most influential managers we see in the world football, hope he will back soon and wish him all the best.
I think he is not well,Im scared. He might be sick,this is just too sudden. Hopefully Im wrong though
No one can replace him we have to give him the proper good bye.we will miss u legend.manager.KLOPP.
Though i am not a liverpool fanboy, im still in shambles. Klopp has made a lasting impact on every football fan and he will be forever loved by all. YNWA❤
Im both sad and surprised ! Im 62 in February im a coach on my own in México i coach 4 days a week no help no privaledges like professionals i do it because i love the kids and the beautiful game , ive followed Jergen from before he went to Liverpool ive followed and been part of the history of Liverpool since the 70s 54 years if i get tired i cant take a rest . Jergen can get all the help he needs where energy is concerned i believe theres more to this because i know Jergen and he wouldnt jeopardise Liverpools chances by this early announcement its not the best time to tell the team half way through the season this drains the motivation from the team and its far from profesional to do this now in my mind its the worst time to announce this , whoever advises jergen is totally wrong . Ive followed this man i gave hime praise when it was earned but sorry jergen you just lost my respect its awful timing and i believe damaging . I truly believe theres something hes hiding . ⚽️💔😞
Jürgen is the best modern football manager that liverpool ever had. His work ethic, relationship w/ the team, how he respect his players and the opponent every end of the match. Thank you Jürgen all the best ahead😢
Even a Jürgen Klopp running out of fuel has way more energy and charisma and team building power than anyone else in this business. That's a sad day. 😢
We will surely miss you boss, but looks like you really need a proper break and recover from all the stress that you have been through. We will go on from here and you have built a great foundation for the next manager to continue.   You brought back Liverpool to our glory days and for this you will go down into the books as one of the top managers to ever achieve it. Hope you get a statue in Anfield to honour all the work you have done. All the best boss. Will miss your antics on the touch line and your celebrations.
Sorry for my poor English. You are the manager. That's one of the big reasons I became a Liverpool fan. Treasure every meeting, for it will never recur. I will miss you very much, but thank you very much for the wonderful time and memories.
Why my eyes are getting filled with tears
I was really sad when I saw the news 😢. I still am. I can't believe he's leaving—I wish he wasn't, but I respect his decision. What a heartfelt interview from one of the greatest managers ever. His heart, brain, and personality will definitely be missed. Let's enjoy the remainder of the season and win a few trophies. 🤝🏼💫  (Lowkey worried about what this means for some players—will they leave sooner?—and who will take over. I don't trust any manager except Xabi Alonso tbh)
Thanks Jürgen. God bless you and enjoy your future years.
🥺😭😭
Thank you klopp, Liverpool at heart❤
Klopp du machst das richtig 🙏 denk an dich und deine Familie . Gottes Segen auf deinem weiteren Weg . Du strahlst und gibst so viel Energie und jetzt ist mal Zeit für dich. Gruß von der Ostseeküste.
🙏💗🙏💗🙏
Thank you Jurgen🙏  Your style of play made me watch every single game Dortmund and Liverpool were playing it goes without telling you the phenomenal one, I always wondered what went wrong with the team last season  when Arsenal were playing very interesting games and you just answered me "running out of energy" being a Chelsea fan I'm surely going to miss Chelsea vs Liverpool 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Leaving bicoz salary x naik ka... 😅Yela korang punya club ni x menghargai
Klopp normally changes clubs every 7 years. He overstayed. Next stop. Germany's national team or Bayern Munich.
Thank you as a rival fan🎉.
What great honesty - now he can slow down & "smell the roses"!!
I admire men who espouse integrity and forthrightness. Jurgen Klopp is one of them.
HEARTBREAKING 💔 No words. Absolutely gutting.
He’s a special man
Bau-baunya beliau akan hijrah ke club' Arab, mungkin dengan pengumuman Resign dini seperti ini, kelak entah itu kapan waktu gabung ke club' Arab biar kesannya tidak Maruk uang. mungkiiin..
It's one of the saddest moments as a Liverpool fan. The energy, love, and success, growth, silverware, passion, memories he has brought us in his time as our  boss is like nothing else I've ever experienced. The last few seasons have been a rollercoaster of emotions. The highs of winning and the lows of falling short in both the league and Champions League and Europa League finals. He reignited the fire of being a fan.   He is the father figure most of us would have loved to have had. Thank you for all the joy you brought to our lives!
"Where I'm coming from, ending up as the manager of Liverpool is a fairy tale and a very difficult thing to plan. I would say impossible to plan and difficult to reach, but it is only possible if you are very busy and 100,000 percent committed to everything you do and dedicate your whole life to it.  That's what I did. "  - Jürgen Klopp   An amazing line. Thanks for all those wonderful moments, Mr. Jürgen Klopp, YNWA .
what a guy!! he's the special one for sure
He only won 1 league title, calm down
Er hat Liverpool gerettet
damn.. never thought i would ever say this... gonna miss him man! He has been an important part of PL.. WISH HIM THE ABSOLUTE BEST FOR HIS FUTURE.
I'm crushed. I don't know how to see Liverpool without him
We are Liverpool ❤️
😭😭😭😭😭
Is there any way to change your mind. We still love you
I was devastated after hearing this news but after seeing this interview I can understand his situation better. Ofc we supporters want him to stay but we visit or watch the game once or twice a week, look up for the news and then switch back to our normal day to day  life. For him it’s been a constant routine for 9 years, I can understand he is tired. He has always been the Normal one, a person with negligible ego,humble and down to Earth. I hope we win everything by the end of this season and give him the most perfect possible Goodbye, but even if we don’t win anything, he will go down as one of the greatest Manager to ever manage us. In Klopp we trust ❤
Jürgen Klopp bester Mann ! Neuer Bundestrainer bitte👍👍👍
There’s just no words to fully describe how great of a human this man is. This interview is just the tip of the iceberg, but it is a great insight into the person he is. Honest, earnest, passionate, and so genuine. He calls himself the Normal One, and it is exactly that that has made him the Special One. It says so much that his humanity will outshine his football genius, when we come to the end of the season and let him know exactly what he means to the club and city of Liverpool. We will miss the man he is, more than just the manager he is. YNWA, and let’s go for it and add another 4 chapters to this already sensational story.
Choose Life Jürgen, I applaud your decision!
😭😭
Get this man a statue! What an honour it’s been. Throughout my whole 20s I’ve loved watching Liverpool and that because of this man! Honestly don’t know where we’re gonna go from here but I know he’s left us in a good place with a fantastic team! Jurgen Klopp you are legend YNWA!!!🔴🔴🔴
Surprised it's taken him this long. He normally leaves a club after 7 yrs.
😭😭😭😭
😭
The most nice kind humble human manager in football world!!! 😢😢😢😢 we all will miss Ynwa ❤
Liverpool , anda harus membuat patung untuknya . Dia pantas mendapatkannya... Dia membuat semua orang bahagia menonton Liverpool Dia pembawa semangat positif bukan hanya pada Liverpool , tetapi   Bagi semua orang 😭   Karena dia ...
having a tough time watching this. This is too much
Since you're planning to go just know we as your fans,players,managers and also coaches we truly love you and we will help you in times of need and pray to God to guide you wherever you go and in whichever activities you engage in.We love you Hon.Jurgen klopp ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the last gentlemen
i hope you will come back after 1-2 years. pls come back
From Thailand thanks for make me happy since you came to Liverpool. If possible come to work with Liverpool again if not you have best done with Liverpool.
Will he got to pay contract penalty?
thank you very much jürgen klloop, You are the greatest and best coach as long as I have known Liverpool, will always be remembered  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m not Liverpool fan , but I love this man 😢😢 all the best sir 😢
This is almost exactly what he did at Dortmund
💔
Best liverpool manger liverpool ever had in the modern era
Thank you so much Jürgen Klopp..❤😢
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 Enough! LFC will never be the same again without him💔
Sir if by any chance you are not well. (Of cuz I hope it's not it) GWS. 😢
Legend ❤
I am gutted this is really bad news for us but when all is said and Dunn  nothing last's forever the main man is tired and needs a well earned break happens to us all good luck in whatever you do Jurgen and thank you for all the memories LFC legend
Tears ❤
He is not a coach, but a miracle who turns the grass under the players' feet into gold ❤️
If boss leaves , it will be the beginning of decrease of Liverpool 😢
The greatest achievement that Jürgen has achieved is not the trophy and all the wins, but he conquered the heart of fans and even his rival with respect. What a man..
One of the finest managers ever to grace the Premier League. Well done Jurgen on building a magnificent Liverpool squad, facilities and new stand. So positive and always in charge.   You are one of a rare few managers who become bigger than the players and simply cannot get sacked. It is a rare gift. I’m also disappointed because if Pep stays at City they will just win it every year and it will become boring. Bayern City. God forbid.   He’s left Liverpool on the ceiling I hope they dont fall too far down next season without him.
Thank you Klopp. I can’t express in words what you mean to us. I’m here in Malaysia, and the moment the news broke, the fan base just went crazy. Thank you for making us believe again. Wishing you only the best Sir !!
Reluctantly we do accept your decision.  I had hoped you would be our manager for another 10 years.I You have left your legacy and Mark at the club. The stadium is better. The training ground is better. The team is better. The trophy cabinet is fuller. Thank you to you and your coaching team, you'll all be missed.
U r a legend you will never ever ynwa. Thanks boss
Xabi Alonso will be the best choice for the next manager... 🔥
No mane No salah at the end of the season. He’s seeing the cracks and the difficulties and challenges. He’s done his absolute best. 🙌🏼
When the news came out, I felt like an orphan. He is everything that is right about LFC. Thank you Jurgen. The normal one? Anything but.
Semua boleh pergi kecuali klopp
Thank you for everything 😢❤
One year of coaching Nunez and man's tapped out. Jokes aside EPL won't be the same without you.
Γιουργκεν  βαζέλα  στην παναθα ελα
Юрген Клопп ты и есть Ливерпуль! Слезы навернулись🥲
Very sad news for me as Liverpool fun. Klopp is the best ever Liverpool manager I like. Please convienc him boss
Noway loveyouboss ❤
A father figure is about to go😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you for everything you did for us ❤❤❤you and all of your staff team are the best ❤❤❤ love you from 🇹🇭 I wish you have a good time in your normal life as you wish . Thank you so much again for football that you given to us love every moment of that.
I'm so sad but love sir klop
The Greatest Coach Ever❤ Thank you for everyting 😭YNWA
I’m heartbroken, Stevie G’s leaving didn’t hit me as hard as this, thank you Jurgen for bringing joy to us all, you gave us energy when we had none, thank you and love you and your family
Why now😢
I'm crying....
The timing of this is shocking. Unless he is sick, he should have honoured the contract he signed. We have also lost energy seeing our team bottle two league titles and two champions leagues and this video feels like a kick in the teeth in a season when things have been going so well.. I think this news will derail the season, I hope im wrong
I'm very sad, I'm a Liverpool fan I love Liverpool and Jurgen Klop is the best coach I admire. I cried listening to this. Thank you Jurgen.😔🥹🥹
disgusted in jurgens decision, hasnt really left enough time to find the class of manager we need, he owed us at least another 10 years .. disappointing stuff
Can't express my feeling  , numb !  Our Guardian angel❤ I know this day will come but i didn't expect this soon   Very hard to hear ,  this season  we will grab all the trophies we can  , we will give a wonderful farewell  jurgen  We will miss you for sure🥹   an end of the klopp era 💔

Klopp dont leave you are the best manager in the world
im crying 😢
I helped Liverpool because it's the chosen club, gas kloop leaves the new manager will not be the same but I'll see how things go, and they will win the premier league this season. I told you
Come to Barca we need a Top manager like you❤
i was 8 when you started coaching for Liverpool.  you have been with this club for over half my life. I've seen your smile for half my life. I've seen your enthusiasm and passion for this club. no matter how hard this news may be i want you to know i stand with you. its brave for you to step down when your ready no matter how sad i am I'd rather you go off on a strong note then get sacked 3 years down the line. you've done so much for this club, and you done so much for me. so, thank you Jurgen from the bottom of my heart thank you you've been the best gaffer a man could ask for. YNWA Klopp ❤❤
Klopp made Liverpool Great again, he kept his promise and made us believers, he said he will win us trophies and he went on to conquer English Football a great man and great manager you will be missed Jürgen Klopp
As a Man City fan, have nothing but respect and admiration for Klopp and what he meant to football. As a leader and a tactician he stands above! He will be missed.
You can recognise a honest, open, thoughtful, sincere person instantly. There aren’t many more so than Jurgen Klopp. Respect.
😢😢😢
Good luck, Boss. Might be bad news for us, but I do really hope you get to live and experience a better life before old age comes knocking 😢😢
Having established Leadership position in the epl with a balance mix of young and senior players on the roaster so there's no better time to make this announcement
The fucking day of all time
😢
Jurgen Klopp you've meant much more to me than just a football coach. You're an inspiration and role model as a human being. I connected with you through our shared passion for football, LFC, and above all, our values: authenticity, empathy, gratitude, and perseverance. I firmly believe that much of your success is rooted there.  Despite never having met personally, I'll be eternally grateful for the joys you brought me in my times of need. I cherish the memorable moments and, even more importantly, the lessons I've learned from you. As the season draws to a close, your journey continues, and I wish you find what you seek. I'll miss you dearly. Wishing you continued success, and thank you for everything.  From México, Fernando
As a Chelsea man this absolutely sucks. Liverpool will still be awesome without him but he just makes that team clique like no other what a man , what a manager. Big up to all Liverpool supporters 🫡🤝💯  He picked up the pen in 2015 as the story began and today he places that same pen on the table as the chapter ends.  ” the frog at the bottom of the Well drifts off into the great ocean”  PASSION & RESILIENCE 🫶
Tks Boss, one part of this club forever ❤🔴
i love to see klopp new club, i think liverpool will win epl this year
18:06 wish i could say that
this was very emotional for me lets all enjoy him while he lasts (jurgen klopp you are a legend like like Steven gerrad was to Liverpool goodbye )🫡🫡
thank you boss but i'm very happy to see you're finally sacked cuz you were awful last season which sad to see a lot of kops already forgot about it
I was missed you, I will missed you.
It's a pity he can't be given a Knighthood!!! He is one person that deserves one!!!
Tearful acceptance to Jurgen's departure. D great German has transformed LIV in d period he served. Achieved incredible feats n nurtured talents. Jurgen has been a huge success,  it appears his best job for d club has been in d past 12 months. Shame he's leaving. I struggle with d timing of d announcement.  It's a body blow to d fanbase. This might -vely impact his players. Hard to take.
15:05 good one
<3
❤
We already  got the next coach Pep lijnders
I won't miss Jurgen klopp as a manager, i will miss him as a person
I can't handle this
ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Xabi Alonso looking👀👀
But why say it now and not just keep it till the end of the season? Im a utd fan but klopp will be a miss in football worldwide
Absolutely devastated!!! 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Sad and shocked 😲. I've watched about 95% of all the games klopp has manged. It would feel weird not seeing with liverpool. It's going to suck because the club is going to struggle again once he leaves. I am honored that I got to see the best manager manage the best club in the world ! You will forever be a liverpool legend !!!
This reminds me of the day Shanks announced his retirement but let's just look at the pattern here his back room staff are a very big part of this team and the legacy that Jürgen has in progress with everyone around him will progress "it's not the end it's the beginning" Thank you Jurgen you are unique in everything you have to offer and you delivered our premiership title with a 6th European cup,,,,,, YNWA and forever RED 🍻
"It's not so important what people think when you come in. It's much more important what people feel when you leave." 🙌
Dear Jurgen   First of all, you are really a crazy man, you let us know what is the meaning of passion.  I cannot forgot the game Liverpool vs Barcelona 4:0, you let the impossible missio to be achieve.  Furthermore, you lead Liverpool FC  to be brighten again from 1990.  Finally, thank your for your contribution and your family members.  Your family members are uour stronge backup and support.   If one day you can take a seat in Anfleild Stadium to watch Liverpool FC match. It is a dream of Liverpool FC support.  Enjoy your life in the future.   Best Regards   Stephen LO
😢
No boss man my one dream is to play under you at lfc when I grow up 😢😢😢
FC BARCELONA
Klopp is the reason I fell in love with football. He brought humanity to sport in a way I had never experienced previously. I am a life long Liverpool fan and footie fan because of him. Cheers mate, and may you find your way to the USMNT gig someday 😁
Jose Mourinho next please
Legend🙏

As a Liverpool fan since houllier days ..never cried when any of them left...but today I broke down so hard.
"it's not so important what people think when you come in, but it's much more important what they think when you leave" Jürgen klopp
다시는 직관가서 못보지만 항상 응원합니다 우리의 보스 그리고 레전드 한국어 자막 해주셔서 감사합니다!
Sorry to see you go!!!!! Your passion, your teams and the joy you have brought to Liverpool FC and the supporters around the world will never be forgotten!!!!! Thank You, Thank You, Thank You we will miss you.
Klopp es un gran entrenador y un gran ser humano , voy a extrañarlo 😢
Man Utd should offer him 50% ownership and he may change his mind 😂
Liverpool, for the time Jurgen Klopp was there, was my second favourite team, after the disappointment I'm facing from Manchester United. I have a bond with Manchester and I'm waiting for our cup and I'll be free from EPL. It will take forever, but for now, I'm happy Jurgen was with Liverpool. I wish he could have continued but he has done for Liverpool what he could. I'm grateful that he showed us his coaching, his football, gave us football we can love. YNWA Jurgen.
2:20 'little bits and bops' the way he talks, is what makes him so special
Good luck Klopp, we'll miss you.
No
😳😳😭😭😭🙏
😢
shattered 💔
💔
Nothing but the best for Klopp and all his decision. It's hard for me after support this club since young Fowler with all the roller coaster situation until now. Thank you, Klopp. Thank you of everything you've done with LFC. You'll be missed, a true modern football legend.  And for the club, you Liverpool FC. It's my most heart-broken as a supporter if you don't build him a statue beside Shankly and Paisley at Anfield.
Dear Jurgen  First of all, you are really a crazy man, you let us to feel what is meaning of passion. I cannot forgot the game Liverpool 4 : Barcelona 0, you let the impossible mission to be achieve.  Furthermore, I can see that you lead Liverpool FC to be brighten again from 1990 year. It is my pleasure.  Finally,  thank you for your contribution and your family members. I believe that your family members is your stronge backup and support.  I hope your enjoy your life in the future.  I look forward that one day you can take a seat in Anfleild to watch Liverpool FC match again.  I think it is a wish of every Liverpool FC support    Best regards   Stephen LO
The man deserves a break, I’m not a Liverpool fan but the fact he said he will never manage another English club shows how much respect he has for them, he’s been great to have in the premier league!
Ynwa Liverpool fan hope some days klopp return liverpool 😭
The real leader is able to design - literally - another one and give them a chance and space to rise. The Boss will always be one ☝️ I accept your decision. Take care and many happy comebacks!
Wish
Bloody Hell......Jürgen you made me cry. I respect your decision and you're right...WE ARE LIVERPOOL. YNWA.
Klopp's announcement of leaving LFC takes the internet by storm shows how important he is to this football world & particularly Premier League. While millions devastated by the news, millions more dancing to the news with immense joys for the likes of Manchester City, United & London clubs. As a LFC fan we knew at one point this will come but not in this way. At the end players leaves, coach and backroom staffs. This one will be hard to swallow 💔
Just thank you for everything Jurgen. You’ve taken us back to a position where we can all be proud and for someone whose supported the club for over 35 years, you’re responsible for 99% of my personal Liverpool premier league highlights.  You’ll always be more than a manager to many of us.
Jürgen, we can accept and respect your decision. My respect for you continues, but it still hurts. The day you depart, I’m going to cry, and raise my pint in your name. Thank you.
Dear Jurgen Klopp, please come to Bhutan for your deserve break, seem nothing special away but everything one need to get away from everything
Nah man this hurts so much 💔💔
As a Spurs supporter, I have a great deal of admiration for Jurgen Klopp.  He is a great manager and will be missed by all supporters.
Noo
That made me cry my eyes out when when he said “people are going to laugh and make a excuse out of this”
I'm crying reading comments  . I'm not a Liverpool fan but he is a legend a live.
Klopp should announce at the end of the season not now dampen liverpool players and liverpool supporters mood irritating.
I'm speechless for now cause I'm still grieving, someone should beg him not to go at least for a year or two
Father of revolution in Liverpool fr
Even as an Arsenal fan, Klopp leaving Liverpool feels like a big loss for the Premier League. You just can't hate the guy, can you?
the man that was like a father to me and influenced me during my teenage years… even though he doesn’t know me i know so much about him. he’s like a father to me and the way i am the today is definitely because of him. this is more than just about football. this is about losing a piece of life 💔 Please stay
❤ ❤️❤️❤️
I'm crying now
Klopp just want to retire rich already goodbye klopp.
Klopp is like  the Plato of football. Great mind and philosophy of the game but the reason why we all truly love Klopp over most high profile managers of the game is because of his relationship with people at the bottom of the social ladder. He really is just a normal guy compared to most celebrities and if he was made president, he would most probably dress in a tracksuit. What a guy.
Dortmund is waiting kloop
I don't know how can I find out the words mach to explain what Sir Jurgen Klopp has done to our lovely team but simply We really appreciate him ❤ YNWA Klopp
another era is going to end soon and waiting for the new era
Thanks Jurgen for bringing us back ❤
Wait just hold it I had a fing brah moment
First time of my life im cry because someone will leave liverpool, thanks for all memories, title, cup, thanks for good 9 long years 😢
He absolutely killed this interview. I can’t see a foot wrong. He said so many of the right things I feel!
Give us your best one last ride, Jurgen!
Pep ljinders is the best to be the next liverpool manager
ผมจะคิดถึงคุณ นะคลอร์ป คุณอยู่ในใจของผม
So does it means there’s a chance he might come back
Nooo😭😭
Number One
This just shows that if you're not a state owned club (city, psg, newcastle etc) you'd stress your life away into oblivion. Fair play to Klopp knowing his limits. More life Klopp, cheers.
He mkes me weep
You will  always in our heart❤❤❤ BooM
the club breaks the news all of sudden that reminds me of how SAF announced his retirement. Jurgen is a special man, one of the greatest liverpool manager. He won everything with the club.
very sad news, if your are a Liverpool fan which im not so all i can say is HOLD THAT LIVERPOOL FANS.
He has given us so much. Of course I want more and more of klopp. But I am thankful and grateful appreciate how much he's given
I love you
YNWA KLOPP ❤
I’m okay….   No I’m not!
Dear Kloppo,  You turned us into believers from the minute you stepped into the Anfield turf. The times we had with you at the helm were probably the best ever. All the hurt of missing the titles with Rafa and Rodgers was wiped away when you finally lifted the PL for us. I wish the owners had supported you a bit more and we would absolutely dominate and win quite more than what you have and you deserved every bit of it. Thank you for everything Kaiser. You'll Never Walk Alone. Let's go out with a bang and create history. I hope the statue is already commissioned. No one deserves it more than you❤️😭
Sad😢
Thank you for everything Jurgen, we will miss you🥲
Liverpool.... we are the romance of so many aspects of life.. and football embodies this. The extremes of ups and downs. The heart beats, it pumps, it loves,,,  it must also break.  It must suffer.  And it will heal.. Walk on Through the rain Through the wind May your dreams be tossed and blown .... Walk on We're not alone
Good for you!! I’m happy for you!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Very very sad news😢
Respect for him one of the best coaches with Pep and Sir Alex in my opinion, i hope good luck on your next trip
😢😢 we will.miss him
terima kashi jurgen! YNWA!
Your departure will deeply saddens both the club and fans. But we trust ur decision would be both good for the club, ur family and urself. Truly grateful and blessed to witness klopp at the reign. Wishing you nothing but the best.
the legend
Respect ❤ Jurgen for PM ?
I'm sad you're leaving klopp
I'm basically dead inside. Yet , i wanna cry my heart out because this man was like a father figure to me. Right now i just simply can't picture anyone on the touch line. One klopp hug would shatter me right now.
😭😭😭😭😭
Love you Jurgen from a United Fan!
With all love and respect, you should have held  it  till the end of the season. It is a bad timing.
One of the best managers to ever step on the football pitch! From Germany to Liverpool!! A football mastermind! You’ll be missed by all the Liverpool fans and team! we wish you all the best YNWA❤️
Absolutely devastated, we'll never be the same again....what a man of the people, a Father figure to the Team, Footballing Genius, One of the Lads, amazing Character. I was too young to remember Shanks calling it a day so i can understand how that must have felt. Thank You so much BOSS, you made us believe & achieved your promises, you're into Liverpool folklore now. Enjoy your much deserved rest & time with ur Family, YNWA is so apt for you 🇩🇪👑🚩
I started supporting lfc in the Fernando Torres days. As much as it'd been great witnessing so many class players, i dreamed about seeing Liverpool lift trophies and being a force again. Thank you, Jurgen for all the memories. You owe us nothing and you've given us everything. I was one of the doubters that you turned into a believer. It's a sad day but I'm glad you're doing something for you. Much love. Hope to see you on the pitch again.
Love this guy, this is like losing a member of my family. Totally and utterly gutted.
ขอบคุณมากครับที่ได้ร่วมทุกข์ร่วมสุขกับทุกช่วงเวลาที่บอสได้มอบให้กับแฟนบอลและสโมสรแห่งนี้❤❤❤เคารพในการติดสินใจครับ❤❤❤คุณคือตำนาน❤❤❤
Genuinely, thank you for everything.  I remember the days where it looked like a pipe dream that we'd be back to the best on the regular. You gave me, my family, my Liverpool friends that. I know some who don't understand think we're being dramatic, but, we're not.   Some of the happiest times of my life, this man contributed to that. And i'll never forget him or his team.  All i can pray is that the lads give this season everything. Absolutely everything. Go out with a bang, make us proud. Let us cry with happiness one last time.  To Ulla & Jurgen Klopp,  You'll. Never. Walk Alone.
Eish what a heartbreak......!! This message goes to Liverpool players pliz try to win all every single cups this year before klopp leave.premier league, FA cup , carabao cup Europa league,just to shows him love. Mr klopp will alwayz miss you.who's coming next then? His going to give us joy like you did??
So much respect Sir Klopp
I don’t even support Liverpool and this still hurts me😢
Thanks Jurguen. You have showed us the very best example of what it is to not walking alone
Kami harus terima keputusan mu klopp meski itu berat 😭
As a chelsea fan, sad to hear this news. Jurgen klopp was great coach. Thank's for everything
i hope Xabi comes as much as i want him to be a successor to don carlo its still would be a great successor to klopp
I'm still in shock, shed a few tears but oh god my eyes are going to be flooded in his last game. YNWA Jurgen ❤️🥺
👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼 YNWA
Xabi Alonso to Liverpool you heard it here first
Sir please don't go😢😢😢😢😢
This is so hard to accept but admirable from a true leader. Your energy, passion and love for the club has just been reinforced by this heartfelt interview. Now lets win this league and send you off with a bang!  Much love and much respect Jurgen, you will be missed...
Even as an Arsenal fan i dont know what to say this man put Liverpool back on their perch and relit the eternal flame he rebuilt the culture around the club and made Anfield the terrifying fortress it once was in the 70s and 80s, i have never seen a German more Scouse before in my life farewell Klopp we will miss you in the premier League your not only a brilliant manager but also good human being
Gaffer, you are the greatest signing that ever happen to this football club.
Legend
boss you gave us too much even, thank you for everything
No.. please.. LiverpoolFC need you..
I'm not even a Liverpool supporter but the Premier League won't be the same without him, and the European nights with Klopp's Liverpool was amazing to watch. That 4-0 win over Barcelona will live with me forever. Best wishes for the future, Jurgen.
To be honest he is a very clever person. Leave early and dont stay long enough to become a villain.
He deserves a normal life. It's not possible to live a normal life with all the pressure. Thank you klop
why klopp why
What beautiful human being he is. We will never see the likes again. We will have other great managers, but he is once in a lifetime. I am absolutely devastated about his decision but I support it wholeheartedly but begrudgingly. He has to do what is right for himself and for the club.   Jurgen, we love you and thank you for all the wonderful memories, now let's make some more between now and the end of the season. You'll Never Walk Alone, Jurgen.
It is painful to see Kloppo go but that's how life works. We as fans have to create the best atmosphere in the last few games. We all owe this to him. All good Kloppo!!  We truly respect your decision. Cheers boss!!
Welcome to Real Madrid!
❤
If I had to coach Nunez I would quit too
Thank you for what you have done  At least give the reds one season to prepare themselves
Klopp, YNWA!
Thanks Jurgen for the most amazing Liverpool era! Please manage or play in a legends game with Steven Gerrard and i will have seen my 2 favourite liverpool icons on the pitch together. YNWA
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢.😢😢😢😢😢😢
We've been blessed for so many years by his guidance. This is hard. Jurgen must do as his heart bids. Celebrate his presence for the rest of the season ❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
The man is a legend not only of the club but of the premier league. Go on and pursue your wishes Jurgen, you earned the rest.
Soy fanatico de Klopp, es todo un personaje hippie y humilde para mi, ha dado grandezas al Liverpool, bien merecido su descanso,espero verlo mas adelante en otro proyecto, saludos desde Honduras 🇭🇳
Deep inside, since Klopp came in 2015. Liverpool is the best in the era of the club.
How special would it be to win the league 🙏🏻
Jurgen won everything as the manager of Liverpool FC, UEFA Champions League x 1,  UEFA Super Cup x 1, FIFA Club World Cup x 1, English Premier League x 1, English Carabao League Cup x 1, English FA Cup x 1 and English Community Shield x 1. He made it possible with his charismatic personality and leadership. He is the best LFC manager in the past 30 years. Without Klopp, we won't be where we are today. I will really miss you, Mr. Klopp. I hope we can write more story towards the end of this season and players will give everything to give a memorable farewell to Klopp. YNWA Klopp, in Klopp we trust all the way. Fans from Malaysia 🇲🇾
Come to barcelona jurgen🎉
Over the years I have learnt to never go against a Jürgen Klopp decision. We love you and wish you all the best in life after Liverpool. YNWA
I wasn't happy to hear this news but it was the right decision Thank you from me, indonesian liverpool fans
💯Champion loves Liverpool top man 🇮🇪🌎
if LFC come out with a all access show then we will all know why Klopp left and we will riot in Boston.
No
Klopp is good for come back to Dortmund 😊i hope it
Don't cry because its over. Smile because it happened. YNWA
Totally respect your decision, Jurgen. Speechless when first knowing that you’re leaving but understood. 9 years in one of the most demanding position in world football is no easy task but you’ve done it marvelously. “Mentality monster” attitude that you’ve grown in your team has turned many doubters to believers. As a LFC supporter for 26 years, I was one of them. Hope you have a nice rest and come back to Liverpool again in the future, no matter what role it is. Thank you so much for the happiness of watching football that you’ve built for The Kop and the world football over the past 9 years. YNWA!
I wish you good health ❤❤ thanks for all you did to the club and players
almost too real for the epl but so sincere and heartfelt. mad respect for his professional and personal integrity. somehow I feel like this would motivate the team for the remainder of the season and not the opposite. arsenal fan but hope Liverpool and fans make the most out of this season for this man
Hes not telling the full truth
💯Champion loves Liverpool Good Luck ☘️🇮🇪
Even as a Man Utd fan you cant hate this guy. Nothing but respect for the job hes done .. the charisna and passion hes shown and the way hes carried himself .. his honesty. A legend of the coaching game and a great human being who deserves to leave on his own terms which is a rare thing these days. Football fans and the EPL will miss you big fella.
He looks drained and it aches me. Some things are still hidden here..well maybe best to left these unsaid Big loss for the prem
Respect to Him n the work he did for Liverpool. We will always remember Him as Liverpool Supporters. You Will Never Walk Alone.
Keeping the current position in the league till the end of the season would be a sweet farewell gift from the squad. Feels exactly like when I heard Gerrard is retiring. YNWA Jürgen thanks a lot for keeping our heads high.
Great coach , manager and an even better man . History is made by men like him and part of His story become Liverpool football club history  . An honoury scouser.   YNWA
Spurs fan here saddened by this news. What a guy. Love his press conferences and everything about him. He will be sadly missed
Best Manager ever!!😢  Please take a one year break and Manage Korean National team!! Sonny and Hwang are waiting for you.
Jürgen such a Legend ... And I believe this will actually push the team for the Season Final
Im a United fan through and through but i LOVE this man!
Thank you sir Klopp, your choice, your life  We all love you YNWA
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Thank you!!!❤
Thank you Jurgen for everything, you didn't just win football matches, you brought pride to an entire city -- well, half of it ;)

before it's too late, i like you
lets go ! germany needs you. Jürgen Klopp
Great coach I feel his feeling he want to take a brake and enjoy his life for now until coach Germany in the World Cup
Love JK am fromThailand 🇹🇭 ❤
Wth man... Coming in my feed at top since yesterday... Not gonna watch it till he leaves.. hoping for alex Ferguson like switch to not leave in the end..
Thank u for ticking off  something on my bucket list . To see liverpool win the Premier league.  Thank u so much . People live a whole life time and it never happens . So im thankful
Klopp is class. I will miss his leadership, his love for Liverpool,  and all he gives whether on or off the pitch.  Godspeed sir and best wishes and LIVE! YNWA❤❤❤
Man United fan here. I was randomly watching Bundesliga 2 around 15 years ago, i was amazed by Mainz 05 style of playing and how they destroyed the league that year. Honestly, I was jealous with Liverpool when they had Klopp as their manager because he alongside with Pep and Carlo are truly world class manager that any fan in the world would want to get for their club. It is a loss for the Premier League when Klopp leave, wish you all the best Mister
Please why exiting this crucial time ? You'll forever be remembered in Liverpool FC for your positive contributions. Indeed, you've fought a good fight both in EPL and European champions league !
Thank you Mr. Jurgen Klopp for the years of really enjoyable football. We will definitely miss you at Liverpool FC. 😭😭😭
Im cryng...why jurgen?
Hopefully sinade zidane will be lipervool's coach in the future
As a hard working man. I completly understand this guy.
Danke Schön! 🤗
😮😮
Y.N.W.A
I think he wants to spend more time with his grandchildren
My favourite manager since Dortmund days. The full package
When I got told by a manc taxi driver today I was like " who said " ? Flashback to that kid getting told Shankly was leaving 😮  you remember the  famous clip ,   that's how I felt though  like a wide eyed child shocked,   also I knew the manc taxi driver was loving it . Wounded I am. The lads have to be professional and be even more focused to win for this great manager . Pep Guardiola said he,d sleep better... Im in shock like you all so forgive me rabbiting. At the least he,s brave enough to say the truth . Total respect.  YNWA
No Klopp don't leave Liverpool we love you
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Love you mate. Thanks from Australia YNWA
Incredible competitor and tactician but THE master of player relations… exudes respect. Wonder what Ted Lasso will do next year, logical successor.
Yes 🎉
I'm devastated but god bless you Jurgen and thanks for some amazing memories.
It's a really emotional moment for me. What a special manager and person. All the best from Austria! Danke für alles Jürgen!
💔 miss you klopp
I’m fully supporting Liverpool until end of season. I want them to every game and all trophies.
You are a beautiful human being, Jurgen. Love, YNWA.
They have to nail the replacement right on. It would’ve been so nice to see him win a champions league one more time he deserves it and more!
Heartbreaking
💔💔
Thank you for bringing me so much joy. The memories you gave me I will never forget. You were a constant positive figure throughout critical moments of my life. You have been such a father figure and a role-model from afar. I have learnt so much from you about how to excel at something while still being an amazing human being. I will be eternally grateful and will follow your journey for the rest of my life. Good Luck with whatever you decide to do next! You’ll Never Walk Alone! ❤
16:53
Klop is a living testimony of emotion+love+clarity+success+life enjoyement. FYI i am a manutd fan so take that to your heart!!!!!!!
Jurgen said to me were gonna win the Premier league, you know he said so, let's win all 4 trophies for the best goodbye ever, thanks for your service Jurgen you absolute legend
I will pray for Liverpool to win all of the 4 trophies this year as a gift for our boss. EPL, Europe league, EFL, FA cup  will be yours our Klopp❤
Damn, End of an era.
A true leader knows when to let go, even though he knows he is untouchable.  Thank you Boss
Very smart to announce now for proper planning unlike other clubs rushing to get managers and always sacking eventually
I love Germany! I love the German people!  I love Juergen Kloppp and I think he represents the best of the German people.  Yes, I’m sad but happy at the same time. One door closes another opens.  Good luck Jurgen!
I am an Arsenal fan, but good luck to him
Well, knew at some point this day would come..... No matter what happens...The man is already a legend, for what he has done to the club , the success he has brought , the 30 year wait .  It's a tough job and i respect that.... He deserves to leave the club on his terms. Thank you , Mr Klopp for everything . Wishing all the very best.
As a lifelong Arsenal fan, I have nothing but respect and admiration for Jurgen Klopp after hearing of his decision to leave.  He has done such a tremendous job for Liverpool which was no surprise to me as he was my choice to replace Arsene Wenger years ago!  A class act throughout, I hope he can take a break and recharge for his next life stage. I wish him nothing but the best for the future.
Long Live Jurgen Klopp ❤
Thank's Jurgen 🙏🙏🙏
Thank you for everything Jurgen🫶🏾 Id you want to go, go proud and bring everything back home 🎉 YNWA 🫶🏾
What a legend
After this season ends Whatever path you take, we wish you success and may you remember that you will never walk it alone. Anfield will always be your home.❤
Love you so much gaffer. Forever
Enjoy every moment, because they will come to pass.
VAR and the amount of matches definitely made him burn out 😢
why boss????i think you gonna stay with us  forever...you have broke my heart,its very2 sad day to heard that u gonna live us...good bless u boss..forever..YNWA😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I hoe he finds more peace and physical rest. Thank you for all the joys. Klopp is Liverpool, Liverpool is Klopp. Things will not be the same, but thank you. YNWA.
I am very sad to hear this news, it is hard for me to accept this statement.😩😫
😢
This is what happens when Man City is allowed to destroy the league. The best coaches dont even want to waste their time trying to compete
so sad.. im heartbreak for now.. you're the best manager in the world jurgen, thanks for all
The prem just ain’t going to be the same without him 😢
As an arsenal fan i take off my hat and say well done Sir Jurgen🎉
There is no one like him..
Tqvm, Mr. Klopp for all you have done for Liverpool FC and your openness about your plan.  All the best for your future 👍.
Shin Tae-yong in
Arsenal fan here. I’m even heartbroken as a football fan but it’s humane to understand where he’s coming fr. Have to respect his decision. Quality of a person!
Class
Job burnout!!
The biggest takeaway from this is JK stating he's healthy. That's all that really matters. He's just had enough for a while. Liverpool will go on.
Good luck sir,a premier league legend,west brom fc
You need a break!
I can't watch it. No, it's heartbreaking
Thank you Jurgen
Salute and love you, Jurgen. ❤ Thank you for everything that you and your staffs have done for the club and for supporters. You wrote a history for us. I was crying inside when I knew this. As a supporter, of course I don't want this to heppen, but when it happens then I respect your decision boss. YNWA
Pls one more title for this gentleman n LFC before we face another barren 30 years! Many of us do not have another 30 years left. YNWA.
It is shocking and heartbreaking,  but I know and can feel how much you love this club.  So, I understand the reason why you made this difficult decision.  Thank you, Klopp. I will never forget the positive energy you have given us.  The team spirit and your legacy will always be with us and in this club.  Since you joined this club, even waiting for matches has made me excited  because even on TV, I can feel your powerful energy.  As a person and a manager, I truly respect you, and I genuinely appreciate everything.  Danke schön❤
Simple -YNWA ❤
A lot of respect for the man, that was a very honest and direct explanation and you can clearly see the passion and love he still has for the club, and the game.  Top man Jurgen 👊
YNWA Klopp!
I think this breakup will be quite difficult for me.  I will support you no matter which team you join after.  It looks like Anfield will be a bit cold for a while. thank you coach
Be BRAVE Be YNWA For Us 😢 Thank U oppA Kloop😊
"The only one Man I ever seen the real lovable person in this selfish world is only Jurgen kloop።Jurgen kloop is the only one sign of love ever።"እንዴት ፍቅር የሆንክ ሰው እንደሆንክ ሳስብ ኢትዮጵያ ትዝ ትለኛለች።
I Feel I lost something in my life, it's not the same anymore, that's the weird feelings, I wanna cry everytime I see this men, I haven't been crying since I was born, 😢.
I can't remember seeing that many gutted scousers since the invention of locking wheel nuts.
This man is a marvel. I enjoy watching Liverpool, and enjoy Klopps passion. He seems not to have a nasty side, just a decent honest respectful and respectable guy.  English football will miss his huge happy personality.
Thanks to be good manager in Liverpool...❤❤❤.❤...... If next next next year... I hope you can be manager Indonesia team......
🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
Juergen, thank you. For everything. ❤
❤
Best to you, legend 👏🏼
Next German national coach... easy job..
I love you and thank you klopp YNWA! 😢❤😊
NOOOO
The master at creating a top player and team out of nothing… Mastermind
A great man and a gracious exit. His legacy is set in stone and he leaves on his own terms. Regardless if they win or lose anything, he is leaving the club in a great state!
Thank you Jürgen, simply a legend
YNWA
Thank you 🙏🏻 and good luck ❤❤ to
Klopp！Klopp！really？😭
Tq Sir🎉🎉🎉🎉Klopp  For the best memories as a LVPL fan  Making me a better human via  Your aura and belief in players,  the press conferences emphasizing on -  MOMENTS..MENTALITY..NEVER GIVE UP  applicable for life in general🎉🎉🎉  YNWA❤❤❤
🥲😭
great news 👍💪
One of the saddest days in Liverpool FC’s history I saw a little foreshadowing. He’s gonna be the boss for Germany next year mark my words. Love ya Jurgen.
Only other time I ever cried in football was Messi’s departure from Barcelona 😢
I'm not expecting this at all but after hearing his explanation, as a normal human being, I really understand & respect the decision he's making. Thank you for everything & all the best to u "my legend". For me, U are definitely & absolutely the GOAT. Thank you JK.
Love so much JK ❤ MU FAM
I never thought I would cry over a manager leaving but man... This man means more to me as a fan then I could ever imagine. He has become a synonym for Liverpool fc. He is a club legend even larger then many players we've had. I am so happy that I was lucky enough to experience the joy, excitement and love that he and the rest of the team have given us. Wish you all the best!

The biggest regret as a Man U fan is we could not get an icon of a manager like Sir Alex. And still thirst for managers like Klopp and Pep, really sad to see Klopp leave… All the best Nr. Jurgen Klopp …
😭😭😭😭 jurgen kindly 😢😢😢
Can't we just pretend that this announcement never happened?
Bruv am broken like fr. Somebody help.
Klopp, take your time, 1 year or 2 year, and take a very good holidays! Later, when you want to make it again, come to Brazil, we really need a strong and right person like you in Brazil. You always will be welcome here.
Saya harap dia kembali setelah rehab
why klopp please jurgen 😢 don't live please😭😭😭😭💔💔💔
Question to Liverpool fans ...who do you want ? And who do you think you'll get ?
This man and his team did so much for the club. Absolutely legendary legacy for him and his other coaches and the players. Lets keep this ball running, i know klopp wont leave full time, im sure through the first season of our new manager klopp will be there guiding the new manager through it. Thanku Klopp❤️
Klopp to Roma, Jose to Liverpool
YNWA!!!
you guys are fu*ked 🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for everything for this club Jurgen 😢 YNWA
As the saying goes, ALL GOOD THINGS MUST COME TO AN END. As a Liverpool supporter since the 70's and wish Jurgen Klopp the very best in all his undertaking. Thank you for the revival of Liverpool and taking the club into new height from 2016 till the very day..... YNWA
He is the living testament to hardwork, determination, grit and patience in our lives to achieve beautiful and blissfull moments. You will always be our boss who is etched in our hearts. Love you always❤❤ and will miss you😢

My father was shocked and cried when you left the club' 😢
Ynwa kloop
Im so depressed now im ganna miss klopp thank u for the memories we love u klopp ❤❤❤
what a legend, all class to the end and i hope he wins things at the end of the season
I woke up this morning at 5.00 am  off shore on an island called Barrow island western Australia where I work.  I woke up to the announcement of Klopp leaving @ first I thought it was a joke , then realised it was serious.  This is how I felt ,that a part of my soul just left 😧 Totally in shock  And I do not show emotions very often I was born in the UK Kent  Emigrated to Australia 2004  LFC supporter 40 years   This has rocked me .
So sad the worst ever news I ever expected to hear my heart is breaking into a million pieces we the fans valued you as a father figure and you were the reason that the top players chose to join our beloved Liverpool team because of you the supportive caring father figure 😢why ooh why would you choose to desert us now when you have our team back to the winning ways after last season's reality though time I'm devastated and cannot see a future Liverpool without you not only do you have players who move mountains to play for Liverpool under your leadership because like players we the fans are devoted and loyal because of your never say die attitude which has made us believe in you and rally around you because you always made us believe that together as a family with you at the helm we would always overcome and grow from strength to strength Liverpool will never be the same without you and your determination to make our beloved club the best in the world your leaving now is like losing a loving devoted father who kept the family united through good times and bad times but we always knew that with you nothing would be impossible this is the saddest day for our Liverpool family feels like the death a dearly beloved father figure I don't know how I would ever get over this news and don't think that we would ever be able to replace you I sincerely hope that in time you will reconsider and come back home to a family that loves and appreciates everything that you have done for us no one will ever be able to replace you 😢 I'm shocked shattered and broken hearted 😢😢😢 😭😭😭💔💔💔
Thank you for everything Kloppo, best regards and YNWA
He will go back home to Germany have a bit of time off that he needs for himself then he will take over the German National side. The World Cup is the only thing left for him to win & is the ultimate achievement for a football manager. It explains why all his bootroom staff are going with him too. Think about it.  International football has far less games which means Jurgen will have more time for himself & family & less stress! - Good luck tohim whatever he decides to do! ❤🇩🇪😁⚽️👍
😢 Noooooooooooooooo
klopp sounds like  when a ho tries break up with u
เราเสียใจที่คุณต้องไปจากทีม แต่เรารักคุณมากขอบคุนจิงๆ
Im never watching premier league again😢
he's done a quite incredible job at LFC but still could not overtake or even catch Pep and Man City. Playing 2nd fiddle after all that effort he invested had to take its toll eventually. He wan't backed fully either and that will have been a factor in his decision making. He could easily be the next manager for the German national team "if" they struggle in the upcoming competiton. Man Utd would walk over hot coals to have him take control there as will many other huge clubs!
Nooooooo
Ok so u r leaving gudluck with gud health regain ur energie liverpool will remain liverpool  god bless u kloop n ya win ze league n all the cup
thanks for everything boss  I may represent the Big Reds The Kop fans from Indonesia 🇲🇨🇲🇨, wishing you all the best boss..  all your services We will always remember your achievements, your hard work, forever... big love for you JURGEN KLOOP❤❤
This is a good man.
mr yamani will miss u a lot
Respect your decision
Thank you for your past dedication and enthusiasm. I'm so fascinated by the way Klopp plays, and I'm worried about the future. I'm rooting for you no matter what choice you make. Thank you for giving me an attractive game. -From a fan in South KOREA
Uma era tão linda que se acaba, viver isso foi incrivel! Relação torcedor, clube e treinador foram de um sentimento tão único, pouco visto no futebol nos últimos tempos.
🙏Thank you Mr Jürgen Klopp to make LFC more than a club but a big family. For me LFC under your management is such a memorable football team in my life. May God have a best plan for your future. God Bless you, Sir.🙏
No matter what team, what league, what manager you support, not loving Jurgen Klopp is a sin! This guy is a true man!  Forever a legend of football JK!
As a Chelsea fan, I think Jurgen is a pure legend! Wish you best of luck for ur future.
Noo
Salute the champ ❤
💔🥲
Today is one of the best days of my life. City till I die. I expected jurgen giving me a heart attack by age 50, now i can easily make 70
I have cheered Liverpool on a few times when I knew Arsenal were not going to win. Great team, great Coach and a lot of fun to watch. All the best Klopp.
Klopp was one of the best managers of all time, I hope this is a prank and everyone is joking, I can't sleep tonight with knowing Klopp left.
It's normal that one day we must part. As fans, we are saddened by his decision to leave. But we respect and are happy that he will have a great life with his family in retirement. We would like to say thank you for the past 9 years, he has made Liverpool better. He really makes us happy. He is Jürgen Klopp, Beloved Boss of the Kop We will always support Klopp, his team and our players. We hope he gives us a farewell gift of 4 trophies, before he leave. We should have a statue of him at Anfield.  YNWA
This is so sad😢😢. Good luck, Jurgen
I want you to play with Wataru Endo.
What I admire Jurgen Klopp is not only his knowledge in football but also his skills in motivating the players as well as the fans. He seldom scolds the players or complain about the rivals
Heartbreaking 💔
YESS 😂😂😂 LOSERPOOL😆😆 (YNWA)  YOU"LL NEVER WIN AGAIN🎉😂😂
Done so much. What a legend. We will miss him greatly. Amazing person.
As a man Utd fan, all rivalry set aside, Klopp was an amazing manager and really shaped a strong team with some real talent. I really enjoyed watching him bring a different play style to the league. He has been one of my favourite managers to watch, and has made such a big impact on the club. All the best Klopp, and I hope Liverpool don’t struggle as much as us and Chelsea with finding a suitable replacement.
He made history with our club & he will forever part of the history of our club Thank You Jurgen Norbert Klopp ❤😢
I'm crushed. I don't know how to see Liverpool without him. Always be the greatest to me! Thank you for 9 magical, extraordinary years Klopp💔 Wishing you the absolute best
🥺❤️❤️❤️
As a Liverpool FC fan, bidding farewell to Jurgen Klopp is bittersweet. His tenure has been marked by unforgettable victories, heartfelt camaraderie, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Klopp's departure leaves a void, but his legacy of passion and unity will forever resonate within the Anfield faithful. Thank you, Klopp, for the memories, the joy, and for instilling the belief that we truly never walk alone. YNWA. 🙌
Outstanding.
Thank you Mr jurgen klop u are the best manager in the world
Thank-you, Jurgen. We will love you forever. Liverpool will always be you and your family's home away from home. You have given us ALL. You have given us EVERYTHING. Imagine being us. You turned us from doubters to believers, again, and again, and again. You'll Never Walk Alone, Herr Klopp. What a man. What a legacy. You made the people happy. God bless and good luck, forever and always, Für immer und alles. Velen Danke. WE ARE LIVERPOOL and we will show the world, yet again, our pedigree and class. This season we will farewell you with a silver laden parade. Of that, i am certain. We go again from now until the day you walk out of our doors. Lets make some more history together <3
Tb to 2015 when I was supporting Dortmund and in EPL I kinda love to watch Liverpool games. ⚡️  When I hear that Klopp is going to be Liverpool coach i was in the 7th heaven of happiness.  Since then our relationship grew up, I become a man, Liverpool become a super club again.🌟🏆  And now in 2024 this new…. 💔Man, yes, i’m sadly disappointed and this hurts in the bottom of my heart, but…☝️  I give all respect to this man’s work, truly can understand his decision without any bad thoughts.🫶  His gone is a BIG loss to the beautiful game called football⚽️🎼  He deserves to rest a little bit  and he can come back whenever he wants and  when he COMES BACK…🥁  IT WILL BE A NEW BRILLIANT PAGE IN HISTORY OF ANY CLUB🔥🔥  Love u Jurgen ❤️🤍❤️  Danke mein bruder 🖤❤️💛
This was always going to happen one day but this soon... he has really worked really hard. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.. for the many exciting days and nights and pride of winning.. and most importantly the values you have brought to not just the club and the fans and humanity. I wish you and your family good health and happy lives. God we will miss you so much...😢😢😢
I love watching his teams play because of the beautiful and competitive style he brings to his teams, even though I support another team.  A true great🏆
😢😢😢my heart is broken
The Only German For Whom I Cried 😭❤
Klopp. the only way we can accept your resignation is when you find a good replacement of yourself. Then we are fine.
Rival fans appreciate it Jurgen
I’m a Madrid fan and I feel the loss of the fans when I first heard the news
Thank u for Indonesia subtitle❤
I'm a Tottenham fan of Liverpool's rival team, and I'm really sad that Klopp is leaving from Liverpool, the best team😢
😭😭😭💔💔💔 Thanks for everything Jurgen! ❤
Arsenal fan here, wont miss Klopp when facing Liverpool but as a Football fan I would miss definitely miss a character like JK in Premier League for sure
iam a mun u fan ,he the best since fergie (going forward and attacking teams i mean)  really one ov the best england ever seen (just wish he woz around in fergie era wot games they wud ov been) respect 2 a one o the best ! wot a great character he is !
Noo jurgen
For the record I’m a Man City fan and it’s been a pleasure for us citizens to have him compete with Pep which made our teams even more competitive and more successful. Him and Pep won every single possible trophy that you  ( yes I’m talking to you , reader can think of). You name it. They‘ve won em all. By the way, I feel like the fans will probably be upset with his decision. However they’ll probably support him with everything they can. The stadium might become even more louder than usual. I can’t wait to see Pep and Klopp facing each other at Anfield for their last premier league match.
Thank a lot for what you've done in Liverpool FC . Plzzzz, reconsider about your decision. Mr. Klopp. Requested From,  Myanmar  🇲🇲🇲🇲🇲🇲🇲🇲🇲🇲
Gracias a ti Klopp por todo lo que haz hecho para el club. El mundo Scouser estará agradecido toda la vida! <3
I am very very very so sad to hear it,,,Mr Klop  i am your fans and liverpool fans,,,please stay couple years again
Massive respect for Klopp, thank you for the moments, the trophies and especially the premier league title, the one that eluded the club for so many years. The Klopp reign will definitely be remembered as one of the greatest in defining Liverpool's resurgence as Europe's and England's best club. Thank you. YNWA
As a United fan, sad to see Klopp depart - great manager/person.  Also… Mourinho is free 😅
the normal one wants a normal life. he deserved it. best of luck
Big lost for a our club much respect for klopp thanks for the trophies you bring took years....doors open for legend stevie g 😢😮
True Legend for us, LFC. It is the end of an era. Thank you so much, Jurgen. We love you.
What a guy. It's only football but this genuinely upset me. Thank you for everything so far Jürgen. Hopefully a trophy or two to come before the end. If we get Xabi I'd be delighted.
The only thing that will come true and was always be is that -   "YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE"
Thank you for everything you have given us. What an amazing journey we have been on. Although the ending has not been written yet it’s been one hell of a fairy tail. You will go down in history as one of our greatest ever managers. Thank you for making us all  believe again.  YNWA And I’m sure you will keep in touch with the club and manage the legends game in a year or so.  But for now there’s a job to do, it’s a long time until the end of the season so let’s get the job done.
Genuine guy and amazing manager. Liverpool fans might be sad today but must be glad they had him all these years. I’m Real Madrid fan and I’ve always admired him and his teams. What he has done with Liverpool is awesome, and lets not forget his 2013 Borussia, that team was a machine. Thank you Jürgen for what you have done all those years. I enjoyed so much watching your teams, even if I suffered even more when my RM faced them.  All the best for the rest of the season 🤍
Oh Klopp, of course I fully understand it. As Liverpool fans we are privileged to have had this great man give everything for 9 years. Let's fight to give everything back for him till the last match day. YNWA love you Klopp and Liverpool ❤❤❤
Thank you Klop for everything best of luck on your upcoming project!!
Thank you Klopp for the wonderful memories 🥹
I'm a villa fan & it will be a sad day for the Premier league when he's no longer on the touch line , such a infectious , charismatic character & a great manager, who put liverpool fc once again & back on the world  map as a force to be reckoned with domestically & internationally ,big shoes to fill who ever takes over ,taking them forward
im a united fan, yet im sad and having nothing but respect for this guy - he will be missed! 🙏
Nah I'm crying… this meant more to me than my family members. Thank you klopp, YNWA. Thank you for everything >3
Legend. Legacy. Love.
Great guy, brilliant manager. I will miss him.
CRYINGGGGGGGG😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
A grown man crying here.  My divorce wasn’t this painful! We rarely see moments like this as managers get sacked or taken Ill, but never ‘I’ve got nothing more to give’  Thank you for everything you’ve done for LfC.. YNWA
There are managers who manage football teams and then there are managers who manage football clubs. He re-energised Liverpool. He brought a character to the Premier League. His infectious personality on and off the pitch. He didn't just touch Liverpool fans but football fans throughout the world.
Jurgen,  while we have to respect your decision.   . You have no idea the shock we are in as Liverpool fans..... this is monumentally devastating
Liverpool won’t be the same again without Klopp
Welcome to Manchester United. ;)
What a man class class clasiikkkkkkkkkk efc
As a United fans, i feel happy!
Good luck Jurgen. Thanks for all the wonderful memories. Youre a special special guy.
YNWA simply a true Liverpudlian through and through. 💚👍
He definitely got on offer from Real Madrid. I wonder how he will explain his recovery in June 😅
mr.klopp...you'll never walk alone .👏👏👏👏👏🙌
i am honastly crying. thank you so much for everything jürgen!!! all the best
He is simply irreplaceable
Glad I watched till the end..others should to instead of asking why why why...he knows his burnt out time will come, and it's good he is brave to acknowledge it..tell you he is such an all rounded family man for his family , club and supporters  I wish him well and that Liverpool will get to win at least the PL for him as a parting gift ❤
❤
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. I'll still miss him though
Nooooooooooo😢
In 2018, a distant echo reached my ears from across the Atlantic, whispering of a team in red that transcended the boundaries of a sport. It wasn't just about goals or victories; it was about principles, fairness, and doing things right. Liverpool FC emerged, adorned with names like Salah, Milner, Henderson, Robertson, Mane, and Firmino – a symphony of talents guided by the maestro himself, Jurgen Klopp.  Klopp isn't just a manager; he is an architect of dreams, weaving threads of energy, positivity, and belief into the very fabric of Liverpool. In the alleys of Anfield, a transformation unfolded – not just of a team but of a city, a fan base, and a mindset. Each match was a brushstroke on a canvas, crafting a masterpiece of resilience and camaraderie.  And today, as Klopp announces his departure to us, I reflect on a journey that transcended the boundaries of football. His legacy isn't just the trophies, but the spirit, the fight, and the indomitable will to stand up for what's right. In every cheer from the Kop, in every chant echoing through the city, Klopp's impact reverberates—a testament to the enduring power of a team that plays not just with skill, but with heart.  As the final whistle approaches, I honor and celebrate the man who infused not just a game, but a way of life, with his artistry. Klopp, the conductor of dreams, will leave behind a symphony that will echo through the hallowed corridors of Anfield and beyond, inspiring generations to come.   You'll Never Walk Alone ♥️
Jurgen- you r the greatest of the GOATs. Hats off. Let’s do the quadruple!! And create new memories!!
Now every single one associated with LFC will give everything for this man and win all 4 titles available. Staffs, players, supporters. Everyone.
Lets Celebrate good times! LONG LIVE TOTTENHAM (sadly) nah but seriously,Its sad to see kloop leaving for the end of the season
This man is incredible. Look forward to seeing him come back already lol
As a Man Utd fan living in a family of Liverpool fans, I was hoping that Klopp could be what Fergie was. I know that would make my family members happy. However, I could see the signs, especially last season. Klopp is an honest person and a great manager/leader. Sad to see him go.
After 40 years of passionately watching world football and specifically (EPL) Liverpool, he’s the only manager that has earned my respect 100% of the time. What a class act on and off the pitch. Hard to see anyone else as Liverpool manager. I’m still in shock!!
Thank you for your decency and your love for the club and city.  Thank you for turning doubters to believers and for giving us your all for 8 1/2 years.  We will never forget you Jürgen.
Verry verry Sad...we must say goodbye with alot of cups at the last season!
We love you Klopp, as Liverpool fans we hope you can stay longer, but we respect all your decisions because you are part of the family of this club, and we also know that you really love this club and this club is part of your life. some of your statements in this video make me proud and sad. But anyway, let's focus on the remaining matches, keep doing your best "TheNormalOne"❤❤
Dont go, Jurgen! Qasam hai tujh ko....
Liverpool is gonna be back to default settings when Jurgen leaves.
Thank you Klopp for everything in this club good luck klopp im so sad really sad you leave us 😭😭😭😭😭😘😘
💔💔
It's not so important what people think when you come in. It's much more important what people feel when you leave. Klopp said in 2015
Tough to take, but respect for Jurgen and his decision. Anyway, it's not good bye, he'll be with us LFC fans in the stands and pubs 😂
Lets Hope he is going to Safe the German national team now ..
Saludos desde Costa Rica, es tiempo de descansar entiendo tu decisión y mucho éxito, se vienen momentos difíciles para mí Liverpool lo sé
Klopp was more than a manager, over the years i think the feeling he brought to the fans was a father , a brother , a  best friend and most importantly a believer. Thank you for showing us what Liverpool can, should and aspire to achieve as a family.
Jürgen Klopp por siempre
I cried a little this morning. As a lifelong Liverpool fans I'm so grateful being able to experience Jurgen Klopp. The greatest manager of our lifetime. You may quit the job Kloppo, but you'll stay in our hearts forever.  Next chapter: Xabi Alonso. Period.
Thanks for everything, Coach. You will be greatly missed. Wishing you all the best!
All the best
❤❤❤
Madrista for more than 24 yrs. 🫶🫶🫶 Mister: Klopp 🫶🫶🫶 respect legend , we see you soon in football , take a break ❤❤❤❤ thank u 4 always making the sport greater
As a Liverpool supporter since 2002, I have seen the club from its ups and downs and then back up again, it pains me that he's leaving Liverpool at the end of the season, but mental health is definitely important, especially in today's social media world and age. My heart breaks but thank you Jurgen Norbert Klopp, you've really took our club from the dark days back to light in 2015, where you once said you'd turn us from doubters to believers once again. I was 18 when you joined, and will be turning 27 this year. Thank you Jürgen. Danke. All the best! YNWA.
Geng-geng press has finally reached to Klopp. Sad to see a legend go. Damn we are old😝
Que entrevista tan noble, un grande el dt desde chile qe sigo al Liverpool por su juego tan espectacular.. volvieron después de largo tiempo dormido…. Mis respetos para usted y ARRIBA LIVERPOOL yo soy muy fanático de la universidad de chile 🇨🇱
"Prof" Jurgen is a strategy-genius person in and out side of the pitch. We know that. You took a critical decision in a timely-right moment. You know what you do not know! You know what you know! Avoiding running out of time to make a decision, means give rooms to the successors to think about, snd plan what Liverpool next should be! YWNA.
If you didn’t get emotional hearing this announcement, you’re not a true liverpool fan. Hopefully this will not negatively impact the team. We love you Jürgen.
I don't know why this is coming at this time😢😭😭
Real Madrid or German National team next?
❤
Legend ❤❤ YNWA 😢😢
What's :'(
You will always be ours👌🏾you ain't gonna walk alone our klopp💯
Cảm ơn ông Kloop…ông đã làm mọi thứ cho the Kop và bây giờ câu lạc bộ đã mạnh mẽ, vững chắc hơn!! Tôi không chắc lắm về lý do ông rời câu lạc bộ nhưng tôi tôn trọng quyết định của ông. Tôi biết rất khó nhưng nếu được ông có thể ở lại câu lạc bộ ít nhất đến hết hợp đồng được không, làm ơn!!! Tôi biết bình luận của tôi sẽ không đến được ông nhưng tôi vẫn hy vọng vào một phép màu là ông sẽ thay đổi suy nghĩ để ở lại với câu lạc bộ. Xin cảm ơn! Chúc ông và gia đình sức khỏe, hạnh phúc và tận hưởng một cuộc sống nhiều ý nghĩa❤ YNWA!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇻🇳🇻🇳
Klopp will leave LFC with highly respect. From doubters to believers..love he gegen pressing..good luck Klopp.. Fan from Malaysia..
Wow.......a sad day, a Liverpool fan since the 70s here in New Zealand. All the best Jurgen to you and your family.
the german coaches contract runs out after euro 24 - i think klopp will be offered the job probably then or maybe in private it is a done deal now
💔 😢
take away a covid interrupted season...he knows he couldn't match pep
Dear Jurgen,  I remember how tough for me was when Torres left. I remember how hard was to see Suarez go. It was heartbreaking when Gerrard left. Nothing less was when Mane, Hendo and Firmino left.  But it's nothing compared with this sad news, this one will be hard to swallow. I have always been behind you, trusted you on every step of the road, never questioned your decisions, listened to many press conferences where I learned some great lessons for which I am very grateful. You and the group rewarded us, fans, with memorable time, matches and trophies.  Had some rough times in the past, I was really struggling to get a grip and when almost everything around me was dark and bad, you and boys created for me (every sunday) a small space where everything was great and sunny,. This space was one of few reasons or my fuel to keep going forward.  I just wanted you to know how much you mean to me, and every other Liverpool fan. While you were doing your job the way you did, you made some "invisible" ripples which touched and inspired people all around globe, including myself,  to start doing and live with the same attitude, mentality and values. I don't know is there anything more important than that. I would say that neither trophy can match to that.  It is really hard to resist temptations of praying you to stay, and I will try not to do that.  I will, as always, stand  behind you, trust you with all my heart and try to enjoy and absorb as much as I can while it still lasts. And of course, cheer harder then ever! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.  Sincerely, Alex. ❤
Im gonna miss his "signature fist pump"...
A wonderful human being. A wonderful manager. Thank you for joy you have brought us. YNWA Jurgen ❤️
Will Miss Ya Boss YNWA
This is brilliant!
anyone who doesnt like this man are lying to themselves. I didnt want to believe it at first but after watching this interview, whilst painful, i respect massively and understand his decision completely. Liverpool HAVE always and WILL always be a massive club but the way this man dragged the club by the scruff of the neck will never be forgotten about.
Nothing but respect. Liverpool are top of the league. The squad is in great shape. An absolute LEGEND!
As a Real Madrid fan : He was the greatest coach after Zidane 🤍
💔
Oo9 nkkoonkn knok0009,
People say you didn't bring as many trophies as other managers but Jurgen you brought more memories than any other managers. Your football was pure poetry in motion and no manager in the world cares for a football club like you. Leeds fan here. Will miss you and njoy your time off. You deserve it.
Brilliant man, brilliant manager. He will be missed at Liverpool, and the EPL in general.
He isn't happy about it so as everyone.  But he thinks it's the right decision. That says everything.  He wants the best for the team. Thank you Jurgen❤❤❤❤
Dam 😥😥 What an interview!!! Talk about Candid !!🇯🇲
I think the failure of NUNEZ pushed him to make this decision. Heartbreaking.
i can't, i just can't imagine liverpool without klopp. he was made for liverpool. if he leaves, it because he want to retire or becoming germany manager.
You owe nothing to us Jurgen ❤ you’ve given us absolutely everything and you’re the best thing that has happened to this club in my lifetime. You will be incredibly missed, but you will always be a red and always have a huge place in our hearts. You’ve brought so much joy to millions of us Liverpool fans in the last 8 years and you’ve earned your retirement ❤ YNWA ❤️
I'm trying not to cry, but it's the saddest news I've experienced as a Red fan since Gerrad's retirement, We love you Klopp and You'll Never Walk Alone
😨😭
Simply the best
Sounds like a woman looking for a divorce thinking the grass is greener on the other side.  In six months he'll be posting videos, crying asking fot Liverpool to take him back.
เราเลิกดูบอลแล้วเด้อ😭😭💔💔🖐️🖐️
My brother leaving Liverpool 😢. Best man in the world. What he has done with club nobody else would be able to do it. We have half of season left so let's win everything ❤  Love the man
This is too heartbreaking
Good luck Klopp.👋 😭
Even though this is shocking and sad i can't help but feel happy for him ❤
I’m a Spurs fan but from the day he turned up at Liverpool he’s been such a blessing for his team and his adopted city - and if we’re all honest, he’s been a blessing for football in general.  He always has seemed a man of considerable integrity and character. Go well mate - and God bless.
He made me fall in love with football. While there might be better managers and coaches to come with bigger trophy cabinets, but i will never love them as much as I do Jurgen Klopp and the kind of football he represents. His legacy lives on forever in the supporters, in the club in the people who worked under him. It's a shame I have never had the chance to watch him and his team play in person. But I will cherish his last games as they were the greatest gifts football can give me. Love you Jurgen! Please be well and live a normal happy life! ❤
aaww please juergen don't leave this club,, i will be lost the spirit when i see this club, i will always remember when you bring this club into the track, when you make The player become the best player like TAA, ROBBO,  BRADLEY, JONES, ELIOT, and i always remember when you winning the club  in EPL, Champions League and all the trophy. and i will remember when you make the players have monster mentality and they can beat MU 7-0 and come back with Barca 4-0
Thanks for the trophies klopp wd love you
Respect.🥃
I cried when poch got sacked… I can’t even imagine how Liverpool fans feel I am a spurs fan but to me he is the best coach in the world  Better than pep
Thank you for taking us on a wonderful journey.
Thank you soooo sooo much for everything you’ve done for LFC! You’re my absolute best manager ever in the entire world. My total respect for you and probably one of your own hardest  decisions to make. Don’t despair…. But…. After re-charging, if I can be still hopeful, that you’ll come back someday 🙏😍
whole backroom staff leaving too. even pep. its rebuilding liverpool ALL OVER AGAIN. no current top level mgr are available or suitable! wont be mgr in england? but bayern munich and germany are probably aiming for him starting now!
Huge loss for Liverpool & Premier League 😭
I assume he probably wanted to go at the end of last season, but so is the man he wouldn't have wanted to leave with the squad in that state, so oversaw the rebuild for the next manager to come in.
Klopp is fucking awesome. So much love and respect for him. Such a cool and special dude 🫡
DE ZERBI BEST SUCCESSOR!!!
LEGEND
sadddd this is golden times as liverpool fan for me thanks klopp you will have statue in anfield my hero legend
Wow what a man legend is understatement sorry your leaving what a loss to the game man is so nice love to have a beer with him good luck whatever you do
i'm appreciate with his decision, but how can i express all my thoughts  about him, i love him too much.
noooooo Jurgen
man i am just devastated. i knew this day would come but man i didnt think it would come this soon, and this impactful. this man was an inspiration of mine, he built this football club up from the dirt, he became one of the best managers of all time. i will forever love klopp, i will always support him, he was the definition of an irreplaceable man. i love you klopp. if you ever want to manage again, you would always be welcome to liverpool. YNWA❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Mr Jurgen you always in my hard forever and thank you for everything:)
Thank you Jurgen, thank you for everything. Success for you and family on the next chapter. YNWA !!  Ps: i was realised that your english accent had scouse 😁
From 14 to 21 years old Jurgen has been my favourite human ever
What an interview.   What a man.  Incredible.   ❤
We feel is soul in his words. Great human being, it as give us a true rock and roll football that we love.  Massive respect as someone who is currently in 20 years straight running like a maniac at work, it´s complely understandable.
He is leaving, but will always walk with us
shocking !! So sad to see this day coming. All the best to the normal one and a legend. Thank you for everything you have done.
As a United fan, not only was this moving but I also feel bad for y’all because you’re about to go through what United has gone through since Ferguson left.
A Normal One wants a normal life and WE should respect that. Thanks you Jürgen for all this wonderful years you worked hard in this club and achievements you have made together as a team. With all respect, I wish you will find what are you looking for and YNWA. LOVE&SUPPORT
For me, life is completely about relationships. I don't want to live alone on a mountain. I want to inspire people; I want to be inspired by people; I want to love; I want to be loved.  - Jurgen Klopp
My heart just bleeds. But i honestly think the one person’s heart that’s bleeding most is Klopp himself. So… god bless you forever. A true legend in Life! Not just in the football world ❤️❤️❤️
Jurgen is pure class.  I'm traveling from America to see a match next season and it's sad to know it won't be him on the touch line.
I'm devastated I can't believe I'm crying I'm almost 50 years of age I knew it was coming but it doesn't make it any easier. I just want to say thank you for the beautiful time's jurgen klopp you will always be remembered fondly as one of our greats and we shall miss you dearly😢YNWA Wishing you all the best in whatever you decide to do next
❤
honest, reflected and in this day and age of so many people holding on to top positions for the wrong reasons and not realizing, this is really impressive. as a german sankt pauli fan , i always liked him for those reasons. this mentality is missing in modern football.
If you ever want to go again come back home to US YNWA Jorgen
He is going to bayern.
IM not realy big fan of food ball, but since Jurgen in Liverpool I started to like this sport and this club' although I am not a fanatic fan. I m a old lady from far away country maybe many people don't know where is it. Listen his last speech, my tears were running down.... Thank you Jurgen, you have made me happy moments with the joys of our wins which sometimes it reduced the hard of life.  Hope you will get sucsess and happiness in your life.
jurgen , in my life time , i am 49 , you my friend have been a glory to behold , the best honourable brilliant and gracious manager i've seen , you have made this club something rock n roll , maybe have a rest and maybe manage germany for a bit ?  in my heart it feels like someone whose died ?
I felt my soul crash to the floor when I saw the announcement.......this is seismic,  as a red of over 50 years little has impacted me as much as this. Our Jurgen always and forever ♥️
감독님 사랑합니다 감사합니다
No quiero ver esto
He brought me the title I never had YNWA
Well there is more to life than football
My dearest Jürgen Klopp,  As the news of your impending departure from Liverpool FC broke, a wave of disbelief and sadness washed over me. It felt like a punch to the gut, a swift and unexpected blow that left me reeling and struggling to comprehend the magnitude of this loss.  For years, you have been the heart and soul of our beloved club, the driving force behind our triumphs and the beacon of hope that illuminated our darkest moments. Your infectious energy, your unwavering belief in our players, and your unwavering determination to succeed have transformed Liverpool from a team in the shadows to a force to be reckoned with.  Under your guidance, we have witnessed the impossible become possible. We have tasted the sweet nectar of victory, celebrating Champions League glory and Premier League titles in the stands, our voices hoarse from cheering and our hearts overflowing with pride.  But now, as you prepare to embark on a new chapter, our hearts ache with the emptiness that your departure will leave. We feel like orphans, cast adrift without our guiding light, our unwavering supporter, our source of inspiration.  We beg you, Jürgen, please reconsider your decision. Stay with us, lead us further into glory, and continue to write the chapter of Liverpool FC's history that you have so masterfully crafted.  We need you, Jürgen. We need your passion, your vision, and your unwavering belief in the power of this club. We need you to guide us through the challenges that lie ahead and to help us achieve even greater heights.  We know that you have given your all, poured your heart and soul into this club, and that you have dedicated every fiber of your being to our success. But we also know that you have unfinished business here, that there are still dreams to be realized and trophies to be lifted.  So please, Jürgen, don't leave us now. Stay with us, lead us forward, and help us write the next chapter of Liverpool FC's remarkable story.  We are Liverpool, and we are with you.  With heartfelt sorrow,  A Devoted Liverpool Fan
Klopp will be missed. He has given us many wonderful memories.
😢 legend is leaving us I don’t think Liverpool going to be the same club we may still win but klap is going to be miss
Klopp has made we great and a scary team to play against .heard we are after  xabi alonso hope it works out for the both of them . He has done wonders and if we had money that man city had we would have won more . Klopp  we thank u
YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THE GUY AND HIS DECISION, I THINK WHATS BEHIND IT IS HES BIGGER THAN JUST A FOOTBALL MANAGER, HE WANT TIME TO SEE LIFE, WITHOUT THE EVERY DAY GRIND WHICH IS HARD WORK, AND I YHINK HES A SPIRITUAL MAN REALLY, AND HE NEEDS TO SEE OTHER THINGS IN HIS LIFE, BECAUSE JUST BEING JURGEN KLOPP CAN DRAIN YOUR ENERGY THAT MUCH YOU CANT SEE ANYTHING ELSE, HES AT THAT AGE HE WANTS TO SEE THE REAL BEAUTY OF LIFE, AND THATS THE ONLY THINK MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIVERPOOL TO HIM, GOOD LUCK JURGEN FOR HAVING THE GUTS TO SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH IN YOURSELF, AND HAVE A NICE LIFE, I HOPE YOU FIND WHAT IT IS YOUR LOOKING FOR.
I am still in total shock. This day came much sooner than any LFC supporter hoped for. YNWA Boss. It hurts but we support you❤ YNWA.
Tell me it's a dream. Anyone😢
I’m heartbroken, Stevie G’s leaving didn’t hit me as hard as this, thank you Jurgen for bringing joy to us all, you gave us energy when we had none, thank you and love you and your family
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Thanks you for everything you do for Liverpool 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
👀🔵🔴  👀🔵🔴👀🔵🔴
Im 58 now,  Anfield since 75 age 10. St Etienne etc.    ive been to Glenbuck Ayrshire, Shanks memorial. Ive been to Auckland , Geordieland to see Bob Paisleys area. Im goin Germany to cop Jurgens footy roots.
I really believe that we will win everything this season. He will go out as even more a hero than he is now. We will take someone else in for a year or 2 and i believe he will come back to us. He is Liverpool through and through, once hes had a rest he will be back to us! YNWA and thank you for everything! allez allez allez
Thank you for all the memories Jurgen  YNWA
When you take a minute,you see he is tired....Incredible work. Thank you Jurgen.
Even though I am not a Liverpool supporter,Klopp is a amazing manager- wish him the very best! A legend!
Jürgen danke, dass du Deutschland weltweit so charmant und erfolgreich vertreten hast, mehr als würdig ❤
I am in South Africa and I don't think I will ever meet Kloop but trust me the man means a lot to me than most of the players. I'm really hurt by this and I hope it doesn't affect our league journey
Remain in my heart forever Even though every journey ends But I will never forget my first love. The first team manager that I really loved. Love like a father! Every team member has a part in success. Everyone creates works for fans, smiles on cheeks, laughter of happiness. tears of happiness And sadness. Thank you to many, many, many people. Very shocked, very depressed. Let's move on! Let's continue this season together. Let's make it the most special season in our memories! 🥺❤🫶🏼
Thank you for everything boss!!! You'll Never Walk Alone!!!
Liverpool needs to build a statue for this man for the glory he makes and trophy he gave us truly a legend will be miss😭
Liverpool will go on to win nothing in the next few seasons.
A ,m still crying 😭 mr kloop Iwish you all the best  already we miss you   we love you 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
I'm Arsenal, I got to know Klopp from his time at Dortmund and I was overseas on a trip to bury my father during one of his great Champions League runs with them. I really believe he fit the premiere league and Liverpool well, his successes have been no surprise. I didn't believe any of this until watching this interview. Respect to this man, his body of work and the legacy that he has built. There is no question of his commitment. We're in competition and we'll see you all at the Emirates. Respect... (A Gooner)
world class guy.
Great guy, he'll be missed, yet another legendary Liverpool manager.
That's how it happens When they don't listen to the coach of the team, then regret it before it's too late give him the players that the coach wants
What a great manager. Took Liverpool when they were doing bad and made them one of the strongest teams even though Liverpool has much less budget than City. Maybe he will take over the German national team and turn it into one of the strongest national teams like it used to be.
Did Jurgen just break up with us?
YNWA
Thank you and good luck Klopp 😢 YNWA❤
Thank you Kloppo YNWA
a National role sounds ideal at this stage perhaps
Juergen Klopp,, Saya sangat sedih mendengar Keputusan dari Anda, tetapi saya juga dapat memahami dan menerima alasan dari Anda.. Anda adalah Manager Terbaik sepanjang sejarah untuk Liverpool, No Debat ..👍💪👏👏 Kami akan selalu Merindukan orang seperti anda untuk kembali berada disini .. 😢 Salam YWNA dari Indonesia ..
I'm a fan of Borussia Dortmund and I understand the feelings of the Liverpool-fans very well. Klopp is an outstanding human being - professionally, humanly. He is still deeply missed here in Dortmund. Fans compare everyone who came after him to him. And even though I really like Terzic (who is quite popular in Dortmund as well), I'll always be a little jealous of the club which Klopp enriches at the very moment with  everything that he is. Danke, Kloppo!
😢😢😢😢
Watched 6 minutes and cant watch anymore ffs 😢
Genuine honesty. Something rare in today’s sports world. What a class act. I’m not a Liverpool fan but how can you not love this guy?
😞💔💔
Thanks for the memories Kloppo we love you forever❤️ now let’s go an win💪👌❤️
This man has United a club like no other .Liverpool football club will not be the same without this man . The dedication and love he has shown for Liverpool football club will never be matched .You truly are a legend of this magnificent game that we call football.I would have loved for you to continue and understand totally the reason you have decided to leave .My two sons and I have been following Liverpool football club from as far back as 1971. We Live in Australia and we live and breath and love Liverpool Football club .We thank you Jürgen for bringing back the enjoyment of watching the brand of Football you have brought to the Liverpool Football Club. God bless you and your family .We will never forget you.
😢😢😢
Take care in your life and good luck legend. Thank you for everything YNWA!
Wow what an exceptional human being Jurgen is. Am so glad I’ve be able to witness and enjoy his greatness in this era of football. It’s his integrity and honesty to the core that’s so apparent. In a world of fakery his authenticity is something to commend. I wish more people were like him in other walks of life. A legend in his own time not just in football. You’ll never witness again his like.
Klopp i would like to thank you for the best 9 years of football  its been an honour  having you as manager ❤  YNWA
What a legend (from a Celtic fan)🍀
Respect him forever
🚨🔴Seeing this ‘NEW MANAGERS’ running out of energy and stepping down from the job has made me realize how great was Sir Alex Ferguson. 🤯  26 years of complete dominance and winning everything on his way. Don’t you dare to compare him to anyone. No one come close to him. 🔴🐐

Rename the kop the klopp
Any chance of a ticket last home game?
How wonderful he speech… I respect klopp decision.. he already give everything on this club…
Not only a great manager, but a great man. The way he's done about leaving is testimony to his greatness.
My goodness. I love this chap so much and I’m hurt losing that honesty from our club … however, if we can accept that things change AND our boy Xabi is open to it, I think we will be okay
God bless you klopp do what you have to do 🫶🏻😢😭😭
ผมเสียใจ😢
Great. Now what is he gonna do about Paris tomorrow? 🫦
Thank you
Regardless of your love for the club or indeed Jurgen Klopp himself, that is a great way to leave a job. He's real.
I am hyped by the new federal coach of the German national team. 😁😁
The son of Shankly thank you for everything
No klopp no Liverpool 😢
Jamie Webster nailed it: “he is a better human being than he is a football manager, and he’s the best football manager in the world”. I’d say I wish he’d run for PM if it didn’t give off Trumpian populist vibes. A fantastic role model who just ‘got’ Liverpool.
If there was a trophy for finishing second to city then this guy is the greatest manager.
Just get better and come back. X
goodbye klopp youll be forver missed YWNA
Jürgen Klopp is a Liverpool Legend !  Football Legend, Legendary Person!
The Saddest News 😢😢 Bro this Guy is an Icon
😢
Tq boss😢
I haven't cried this hard since my son was born. I can't believe it.
I hope the players are okay too. I hope they knew firsthand before the official announcement. I just hope the moral didnt go down after this.
💔💔
please retire and dont ruin your great reputation with becoming the german national team trainer or something worse (if there is)
I love you too jurgen
As Arsenal fan, it will be sad to see him go but Atleast he will go in his own terms.
I love this man  Class as always Now let’s go win the league for him
Its a real shame, i love Klopp, was hoping we would get him at Arsenal when Wenger left, respect to the man, i hope Liverpool fans support him and appreciate what he has done and not turn on him, because that would be a huge shame.  I'm also taking "we didnt smash a party" what a great line  🤣
Legend YNWA😢
I love you, Klopp. The Premier league is going to miss you. we will miss you.
I am broken
Why can’t pep our assistant become the manager. Or is Jurgen going to come back in a few years?
We need a statute of Klopp doing his fist pumps and possibly a stand for this man. Now I really regret not having a chance to take a picture with him while LFC is touring Singapore ..Jurgen , you will never walk alone.😢
Thanks for everything Boss
Gracias Klopp por tanto ❤
Big loss to the premier League but makes me wonder is Salah going ?
🥲🥲❤️
I accept your decision!  U are the best and I respect your decision!
Likely, Bayern may sack Tuchel if Leverkusen wins the league and Klopp will manage Bayern. How interesting that will be. He's an elite coach.
😭
First YouTubers now KLOPP???
That's alright Jurgen take a pit stop and get some petrol. The club will be here waiting for you ❤
Thank you Jurgen for everything! Stay healthy and be happy living your normal life!! YNWA!!!
We’ve had 12 hours to process this so far and I’m still in shock. My stomach feels heavy. My heart is in my throat. I’m devastated. I love this man with my entire being and he’s gave me (us fans) the best 8 years of our lives supporting this club. Thank you for putting us back on that perch of belief and taking us to success. You are one special man. I cannot thank you enough. I’ll never be able to process this but I understand. I will keep these memories close to my heart. Let’s go and win that final PL under the best manager there is. He’s leaving us with Liverpool 2.0 and I’m excited to see what they can achieve. Let’s finish this season will lots of silverware. I’m not ready for his lasts but everything has to come to an end. Thank you, Jurgen. Enjoy your break and we’ll have you back if you ever feel ready again. You’ll never walk alone ❤
I'm not updating FIFA after this season
I wish him all the best, his coaching career has been incredible.
Amazing coach, true legend. He will be missed. Thanks for everything!!!
this is how the rest of the country felt when the queen died 😭
Xabi Alonso : "my time has come.."
Nah😢😢😢
What an impressive and mature way to disclose to the fans why he is parting ways with Liverpool. Very admirable.
My favourite coach klopp ❤from India 🇮🇳
Jurgen my friend go enjoy your life you deserve a break, go on vacations every week with your family ENJOY LIFEEEE MY FRIEND
💔
He will make in the future the german nationalteam great again!
😢😭😭😭
What? I spent the whole interview thinking he was retiring, but he's open to offers outside of England! Man.... 1 year holiday, then Barcelona manager?
Dankeschön Jürgen für alles hoffe du gewinnst noch die Meisterschaft mit Liverpool❤
Klopp  I Am really sad you going but you have to go on without Liverpool ynwa❤❤❤
There wont be one liverpool fan who can say its the right decision, but a decision we will respect, You gave us moments that we will remember for the rest of our lives, Legacy is spoken alot but Jurgen you will leave a legacy in Liverpool that will be remembered forver, Thank you for that.. YOU'LL never walk alone ❤
Fucking hell, absolutely heartbreaking watch. It's clear he has given every inch of his life and soul to the club. I was incredulous then devastated when I heard the news but after watching this I understand. No goodbyes now, there are months of this book to write before the final chapter. Just thank you Jürgen, you've been a colossus, you rebuilt a fractured club and made the people happy. You'll never walk alone.
As a life long liverpool fan, today I'm sad but I am also grateful for the joy klopp has brought to liverpool football club. Let's get Steven Gerard or Xavi Alonzo in asap.
A true gentleman and one of the greatest four managers the club has ever had.
I’m an Arsenal Supporter & I must say Klopp will be missed in the P. League big time! A great manager and a great contributor to the league.
He is legend of Liverpool club. 😢 I'm crying 😢
It will be very, very hard to replace Jurgen. The most complete package of a manager that we've got post the 1990s.
Before Jürgen came Liverpool had a number of cups and 3 or 4 2nd finishes in 30 years. They were different before that (80s) but those are just great old memories for those old enough to remember it. He won a league, champion league, world cup, and finished twice in 2nd in the league with points well into the 90s enough to win a league on the moon. But his competitor ie Pep was ultimately better . He has still has a shot at some more trophies and in my opinion playing the most exciting football England has ever seen. And yes he needs a break. And no he can't say " I'll just take a year off and return"". Thank you Jürgen and good luck. We love your work.❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jurgen, YNWA
He’s worn himself out on that peloton bike 😂 nah gutted as a liverpool fan legend 👏
What matters is not how people feel when I come here, but how they feel when I leave here.
This is really sad, Hope Jurgen Kloop foor the best at any club
i can't imagine liverpool without klopp😕
I want Jurgen to stay in England………as Prime Minister! A more honourable human being, you will struggle to find.
As a Madrid fan, I always enjoyed the El Clasico's we have with Barcelona. But every time we play Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, it just makes the game more beautiful. Good luck Jurgen and I wish you the best
I respect what you has to do to us, I respect what you want to do to your life, thanks full  for you klopp
Arsenal fan here. Liverpool is a proper football club and Klopp a classy manager with a winning mentality. And what an honest transparent interview with real difficult questions being asked and answered so openly.  Compare this to the PR club of clowns Arsenal where an arrogant manager who has won nothing and  probably never will, is never asked uncomfortable questions and will continue to be gassed up and never held accountable because Arsenal is a circus where failure is regularly backed and celebrated!
I have cried so bad only twice, once when my father passed away and now after hearing this news
Thanks, sir.
bro I'm lost for words😢
Ahhh, he's tired, He's been spending too much time on his Peloton bike...
I cry all night nonstop thank you for everything klopp good luck on your new journey❤ YNWA 2015-2024😭😭
ลิเวอร์พูล​ 2.0 กำลังเดินไปได้ดีผมไม่อยากเชืีอเลยว่าคล็อปจะทิ้งเราไป😢😢😢
I’m devastated please don’t go jurgen hopefully we can change your mind come end of season
Now that's utter class, putting rivalries aside I have nothing but respect for this guy after watching this, what a thoroughly decent, balanced human being.. I just hope he gets the recharge he obviously needs as he's definitely left his mark on Liverpool fc, football and also so many of us (some more than others at times) ....Good luck for your future Jurgen... from a Utd fan
we love you
My time of watching football i think is over😢..... Why now klopp i think you will stay here as Ferguson in man united ..... This is not a better decision plss think again plsss😢
Sir Klopp !👏🏾
Please wake me up from this nightmare 😭😭
This is where grown men cry🥲
I'm not even a Liverpool fan and I will miss him dearly. This will be a major loss for the world of football. Any book on the history of football tactics or the Premier League will mention his name. Jurgen is such a class act and a wonderful human being. I hope he gets a well deserved break and eventually comes back and takes on another project.
I am gutted, but we all know how passionate Jurgen is for Liverpool. He has been fantastic for the club and for the fans too. He will carry Liverpool in his heart wherever he goes. I wish the man all the best.
This hurts so bad. But I say 3 years and Klopp will be back. Wishful thinking
Why klopp why will you do this to us
😢😢
Thank you Jurgen. Its a hard one to take. But If you are happy we are. We love you and always will love you. Goodbye and for now cry in joy. We want you back in a other role if you want. Statue in front of Anfield 100%. Danke jurgen❤ YNWA <3
One of the managers I respect the most. His statement makes total sense. He’s dedicated his entire life to football. He deserves to live his life the way he wants it. Best wishes to Jürgen.
Thank you so much Jurgen you gave us so many wonderful moments and we’ll keep you in our hearts forever
Please dont leave 😢😢😢
Hope you go out with a bang Jurgen. Incredible manager thats put the club back where we should be.. YNWA from Australia
This is heartbreaking 😢
Wow! 😞
Thank you klopp YNWA ❤
As an Arsenal fan am gutted. Wanted him at Dortmund. Took LFC back to the top again and played the best football I've seen in years. Premier League has lost a gem in Klopp. He had passion and energy that was admired. Shocking news.
top man made a decision for his family .... thank you for what you did for the club you've set a really high bar for the next one
He’ll be back 😊
✨Total respect for this world class manager 😪 I know players will do anything to say farewell with a trophy 🏆. YNWA
As a united fan and football fan i have a huge respect on jurgen kloop.  Great manager in this generation. Take rest and come back strongee to football management.. Hope alonso will no 1 target for liverpool next.
Many thanks Klopp,
Bigger things in life..... My King
You’ve done a great job, and did more than you said you would the day you walked in to our club. We stopped doubting, and believed.  Wishing you good health and success in the future.
You'll never walk alone Jurgen and will forever be in our hearts ❤ Now go and win that bloody League title.
Imagine if could be the next England manager❤😂🎉
Bro like no joke this is so sad it got me crying
“It doesn't matter what people think when you start. It matters what people think when you leave.”  Most coaches would have made this decision last season, but Kloppo has once again summoned all his energy, restructured the team, integrated the youth talent into the first team and will leave Liverpool with at least one title and well prepared for the future!  Mainz - BVB - LFC - and hopefully our DFB national coach after his break🙏  Kloppo We❤️U  All the best from Germany
He's had enough of it all....Really liked this guy when he came in, but the last few years, he's been annoying..His moaning, his teams attitude,  questioning the game played , the field..ya da  ya da....the achieving but never finishing.....Granted, an amazing coach, did great things for the scouser mob, but, even he has reached the end....Enjoy your next venture mate....you did indeed add to the EPL.
Legend. He is the special one. Sad loss to the league. I support another club but I’ll miss Klopp. His love for this club and how he helped lift them back to being a top contender is incredible. He did it all the right way and gave Liverpool something to be proud of. All the very best for your future. Enjoy your break.
Where he will go after 1 year break?
รู้ว่ายังไง วันนี้ต้องมาถึง แต่ไม่คิดว่าเร็วแบบนี้ เข้าใจ และเคารพการตัดสินใจของบอส ขอบคุณที่มอบช่วงเวลาที่แสนวิเศษให้กับแฟนๆ บอสพวกเรา❤คุณ YNWA❤❤❤❤❤
Acknowledging it is never easy, but it’s time for a new epoch: for Liverpool and Klopp. I’ll miss him dearly, but will enjoy the time we have left with him.   I’ve been a Red since 2018 because of the sheer magic of the team at that time. I’d never seen ALL 12 players electrify a football field the way they did. A lot of that was due to the mentality of the players. And a lot of that was due to Klopp’s charisma, character and love for the game.  Once a Red, always a Red. Thank you, Jürgen. Be well and YNWA ❤🙏🏾
❤❤ u jurgen
Why just not give him a full proper sabbathical year and make him come back... Who cares if we are relegated ? Nothing would be the same without Jurgen anyways. As much as I respect his decision..this hits hard man. Cant bare the pain.
I’m a United fan and have to say what a fantastic manager and brilliant human being Jurgen Klopp is and it will be sad to see him go. English football will not be the same without him.Good luck sir and thank you 👍
Bye bye , here comes another 30 yrs of drought for Liverpool 😅
This is EXACTLY like Losing Shankly when he left... No, I was to young to remember that time but my Pops (Scoucer by Birth) Schooled me on Liverpool. This Heartbreaking and im in Shock. But it's What He Wants.   Flags Will Fly with Klopps Image for All Eternity! Thank You Jurgen! I Love You!
Let's go King...
We love you klopp you'll get a statue
Their is no competition without klopp pl is just a league 😢😢
After coaching for 24 years, a break is well deserved. He has earned it. I wish you all the best sir.
NO PLEASE KLOPP DON'T LEAVE
Wow. What a amazing interview. Good luck Jurgen with your journey😃
Herr Klopp, danke, 🔥 YNWA 🤘 🤘 🤘 🔥
Everyone in the comments is like "Im not a Liverpool fan, but...", man where are the Liverpool fans at?
Hi I'm going miss him when he leaves but he a legend always have and always will be brillant man YNWA the legend lives on
Jurgen. The best manager any team has ever had. Love you man. Take your time off before WC26. I hope you leave with another EPL, you deserve it.
I saw on this football news paper in this shop Barcelona want him for next season could be a lie but if It's true 😂😂😂 i truly believe he's fed up with facing Man city nd can't win anything coz of pep wherever he goes😂 i hope he goes Madrid instead nd pep will follow 😂😂😂
Komm zur F95
😭😭😭😭😭
This man and the way LFC is playing made me become a fan of LFC. I strongly hope the team will get him a title as farewell gift!
Knew this day would come at some point but still don't feel ready to say goodbye to Herr Klopp. This man has been amazing and will be sadly missed. Its true he didn't just make Liverpool better but the whole league better. Thankyou Jurgen all the best for your future endeavours.
Who is next?
Welcome xabi alonso i guess
THEN GET HIM BACK AGAIN
I Love Mourinho welcome to liverpool ❤
We are Liverpool ❤❤
Jurgen, we fucking love you❤️
This guy never had a break. 7 years at Mainz, 7 years at Dortmund, 8 and a half years at Liverpool right now. None one of those clubs wanted him to leave, even more, the entire 3 cities wanted him to stay forever! When he leaves, he doesn't just leave a club, he leaves an entire city. All the other managers are getting sacked one day, they have their breaks naturally, Jürgen never had those breaks. He worked in 3 cities as a manager and all of them would not hesitate to build a Jürgen Klopp statue. What an achievement. They love him in Mainz, they love him in Dortmund, they love him in Liverpool. They do even in red Manchester ffs!
BUTS IF ONLY FOR A YEAR WHY CANT LIVERPOOL GIVE HIM A YEAR OFF
Can we have Xabi Alonso to takeover Kloop?  Too soon??
Mo's been running 4'30 miles for 10 years and he's tired too.
He is one of the best managers.  I admit that I was very shocked to see this news.  But I respect his decision.  We  will always remember you, we will never forget. Jurgen klopp❤        from Thai fans  😢YNWA😢
😭😭😭😭😭😭
His rivalry with Pep will be fondly remembered.
Does anyone think he potentially may have something like Alzheimer’s but it’s too private and personal to release just yet ? He’s one of the most talented managers I’ve seen and it seems like why stop when you’re on a roll ?
God bless Jurgen and Liverpool F.C...... Jose mouronho defo a good shout or xabi alonso ...... fact I'm leaning mire toward xabi alonso...... what's tour thoughts people
another great lesson from the boss. it is called self love. leaving the job before you get sick. YNWA
Thank you for everything you did for us and every titels you have given us! I will totally miss ya!
Thank you for everything boss all the best and good luck in the future no one can replace you youll never walk alone😭
Thank you for everything Coach 👏👏👏
It's so sad to hear that news Mr jurgen your our hero and our legend and we love you 💓 but anyway before that let's win the league and the rest is dream 💪💪💪 Ynwa forever
Simply i can't imagine Liverpool without klopp 😢
Gutted his going but we all knew the time would come 😢 turned LIVERPOOL FC into a DYNASTY FOREVER he will be Germany next manager just shocked he has come out with it now😮 but as fans and as a club we still believe and go forward YNWA KLOPP
Wishing him well
The English FA need to pay whatever it takes to give the ENGLAND job to this man in 2025..he needs a year off..then get him at all costs!
Probably wins The Treble now.
If his heart isn't in it, get the traitor out now. Don't leave him lingering to bring down the team spirit. Bring in someone with passion who'll salvage the season
I admire what you have done for our club , amazing . But I fear this galvanizes city and I see no use in announcement now. It is incredibly strange !
come to barca please
what man... Klopp ist ein toller Mensch. Bleib so!
Ok... give him two years off. Then re-hire him after he's recharged his battery. It's worth having an interim for two years to get this man back.
You made me fall in love with not just this club, but football as a sport. Thank you Klopp
Coach Klopp, hope your health is well, family and all together there’s no serious issue regarding health.  Wether is the Xabi or not, for ever missed.  Keep well Mister Klopp.
Danke Jürgen für all die schöne Momente in Fußball und für die noch kommen. 4 title und *uefa supercup Ein Traum!  Respekt und Hut auf! Bleib gesund!
This news broke my heart for real😢
Thanks for everything Boss, may your days be long and filled with joy
While I respect his decision    the parallels with Kenny are quite strong .   Dalglish admitted himself after his resignation  that all he really needed was a break to refocus and get himself back in love with the job .    Has Klopp not thought the same ?  .. that maybe he just needs a year off to get his head together and his energy levels back ?    I hope for his sake that he doesn't leave and then , like Kenny , regret it in the long run .
He has no respect for the fans coming out with that
Not even trying to fight back the tears, but letting them out in appreciation for a true legend, not just of Liverpool, not just of the Bundesliga, not just football, but every aspect of life imaginable. A true class act, a certified genius tactician, and in my opinion, the greatest manager of this generation. Wherever you go, Jurgen, whatever you do, walk proud, sir. You'll never walk alone.
Best thing to ever happen to Liverpool FC. Thank you Jurgen for everything.
Love this legend and I understand his reasons for leaving. But still a bit strange why Pep L and all of his staff are leaving with him. Why?
I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY ....I WILL NEVER MANAGE IN ENGLAND ANOTHER TEAM....BESIDES LIVERPOOL!😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖⚽...BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU NEED A BIG BREAK TO ENJOY LIVE WITH ULLA AND THE KIDS .....I HAVE THE FUNNY FEELING HIS ONE LAST JOB DOWN THE LINE ....WILL BE THE NATIONAL TEAM   :   GERMANY !....
I’m sure there are a lot of personal reasons that went into it. You deserve happiness outside of the footballing world, with your family, living your life to the fullest. The Prem will miss you.
He will Probably  Move To FC Bayern A massive  upgrade  For Klopp...
What an absolute legend. Your going to be missed so much Jurgen thankyou for everything.  Sad day but you do what you gotta do 💔 YNWA
Brendan rogers liked this vid
Respekt Kloppo! Alles Gute.
Hey, Jurgen.   As a fan, for/of: Italian_FOOTball and Celtic, F.C.: - I wander, -if: in the future; after a break: you will be:- tempted, to: manage; for/in Italy/SERIE_A And maybe; even: -Celtic, F.C.??!!
back to irrelevance for Liverpool
The 70 game season and Basketball in Europe feels immanent.
He brought us to the promised land and like many have said today he made the doubters into believer's and made a whole generation of youngs kids realise how special liverpool football is and that is what makes him so special..were losing a special human being but the club will always be here.nothing lasts forever ❤..from a heartbroken 44 year old from ireland!!!...
I will accept your decision i completely understand his decision. klopp I'm Leicester city fan and I support Liverpool club too Liverpool fans please remember to good thoughts he won for you primer league trophy champions league fa cup EFL cup etc and thank you so much enjoy your big break klopp you be sadly missed the football club.
Thanks Jurgen. Heart and soul into the club, cant say fairer than that. Welcome back anytime, I'm sure if that.
Barcelona, thats his destine
I bet y’all Liverpool are gonna win the EPL this season to show much appreciation to Klopp
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING AND MORE!! You are one helluva manager and you’ll never be forgotten and more importantly YOU’LL NEVER WALK ALONE!! The Reds will miss you!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🔴🔴❤️
💔💔💔💔💔💔😞😞
I cried while watching this thank you for everything ❤
It was expected, guys! He gave us 100% of himself and we are grateful for that. He built two teams for us and took us to heaven. Liverpool isn't Man U! We won't crumble. The club will find another manager who understands that Liverpool means more. Klopp won't be there, but Kop will, Anfield Rd. will and the city of Liverpool will. Klopp has written history with our beloved club, but he has other challenges waiting ahead. It's not the last we see of Jörgen Klopp. Another club? I doubt it, at least for a while. Germany's national team? I'm sure they want him to. But maybe he turns up as a CEO in a totally different context. Perhaps an international charity organisation. There's no doubt that Klopp is politically left wing. Labour, perhaps!. If not, he wouldn't be in Liverpool. That's how I see the club, as the opposite to the clubs from Manchester. It's definitely a working class club and Klopp fitted into that culture like a hand in a glove. Liverpool doesn't fight to sign Messi. Never had, never will. Klopp leaves a platform behind for this generation and the next one can build on. We'll win the league again, the CL again, all the cups! Nothing is really lost, all is won. Everyone steps down at some point. This was the best point for Klopp and for the club. C'mon, guys, we lead the league and the chance that we win Europa league is big. Next year there's a new guy there and I have faith in the club to find "the right one". There will be no lack of contenders for that phonecall to come through. We, the supporters, and the owners gave Klopp time. We will show the next managers the same patience. That's important. I say it again, we are not Man U and we won't fall into that carousel. ❤YNWA
Still loving you, maybe even MORE - Boss.  Always on my mind
My heart breaks but what a man.... ❤ You never walk alone coach. I wish my path would cross yours one day, as common men. What a great man.
let's build statues for Jurgen Klopp at four points of Anfield stadium
Amazing  man amazing staff beside you. Respect your decision Jurgen . Let's smash this season. Regardless, thanks for your energy, enthusiasm and your love for the people❤
Thanks boss for everything getting us threw are downs and giving us are ups and changing us from doubters to  believers we will never forget u good luck for ur future YNWA
Sad and will be missed, lets push for every trophy this season.  YNWA
LEGEND FOREVER JURGEN KLOPP YNWA ❤
We will miss u kloop ...best of luck ahead..hope we could win all the remaining cup..thank you for everythings...Malaysia Boleh
What a straight guy, what an honest bloke, all the best Jurgen.
Ah Jurgen thank you. Been a Liverpool supporter for about 50 years. From the day you walked in you brought some magic. So many wonderful times but what always struck me about you was your humanity. You really are a role model. Thanks for your honesty in this interview. I wish you happiness and fulfillment in your future life.
I’m absolutely heart broken
เสียใจเป็นที่สุดรับปีใหม่
Es ist ein Trauertag!! ..nich nur für Liverpool!! Er ist für mich ein ehrlicher und stets ein fantastischer Mensch, der die Gabe hat seine Vision von Fußball, egal wem, weiter zu geben...und die Spieler besser macht, einfach unglaublich..und genial. Danke Jürgen Klopp!!
I live thousands Km away from UK but everyweekend this man makes me to watch his team , but only his team. Thank you sir, good luck and  great respect.v
Come to Barcelona!
A true legend. What a wonderful and humble human being, in a class of his own. Thank you for all that you have done for Liverpool. All the best in your future endeavors. God bless you and your family.
You are the greatest manager Lfc has ever had. Anfield will miss you boss, we love you YNWA
เราเคารพการตัดสินใจของคุณเสมอ..จากไทยแลนด์
Already miss you Gaffer! klopp is the best modern Lfc manager ever ❤🫡👏
Leeds fan from Spain.   The premiership will be duller place without him.  Genuinely feel sad for LFC. I'm not sure another manager will ever grace the premiership so well liked and respected by not just his own but the whole football community.   And an exceptional human being with our without football.   Enjoy your new beginnings Jurgen.
PERSONALLY MYSELF....I WILL REMEMBER YOU....FOREVER,BOSS 😭😭😭😭💖💖🙏🏻👍
Thank you for the great, incredible moments you bring to Liverpool FC, player, team & also the fans. Thank you
For Jurgen, all the trophies and successes matter, but the greatest tribute we can give you  is to say that you restored the heart of Liverpool football. YNWA
you will make me cry 😥😭😨😭😭😓
Brilliant coaching move in another brilliant campaign.
🇧🇷 is hoping this man save our nation. What a great news to all Brazilians. Imagine what he can do with our team !!!!🙏
Been putting this video to one side allllll day but now I’m here. Still can’t believe it but the boss has done enough for us to do whatever he wants. Every game a final now till the end of the season.
Klopp i know you love God and i am sure he will direct your steps in the future.
Just a detailed written statement/tweet would have more than sufficed, it's very trivial but a comical watch lol
Love you, Jürgen! You did a.. unbelievable job at Liverpool.  It's so sad to see you leave..  Farewell, Mr. Klopp.
Feel like I've lost a family member 💔💔. This is fu**ed. Cmon lads... your turn to lift. See this champ off with a couple of 🏆
Sounds as if he could come back in a year or two.
An all time great. Real people that know football know Klopp is an all time coach.
As a City fan. I will miss Klopp in EPL next season. I cannot imagine a Liverpool without him. He helped the club win the premier league and champions league. Everytime City played Liverpool in a match it would be exiciting to watch. Klopp is one of the GOAT. Thank you for everything.
I wish every guy would be as "normal" as Jurgen refers to himself. Values, behavior, passion, mentality, focus, resilience, just like a God given character from a wonder story that we all wish for.
Jurgen absolutely poured his heart in the talk here.
Jurgen ,thank you for everything you have done for my club from the bottom of my heart ♥ we respect you and you're decision a legend in my eyes and you will forever be in our hearts and will always be welcomed back anytime YNWA ❤ 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Jurgen was appointed just after my Dad and Mum passed away within 4 weeks of each other. They both suffered before they died. I was grief-stricken and completely devastated. My former workmate John was a Liverpool fan and knew that I was also a fan, and he trie to cheer me up by telling me about Jurgen Klopp’s appointment and good times would be on the way. How right he proved to be! I still struggle with grief, depression and nightmares about what happened to my late parents, but Liverpool under Klopp has proved to be like rays of sunshine on a cloudy day. It’s been a pleasure to see how the club has grown and prospered. Thank you Jurgen for everything.
Why now? Just another 2 league wins away from being top league winner... For now we are still 2nd..  I thank you sir. Been following you since  Dortmund..
The best manager of my life. I salute you for your hard work. Thank you, Klopp!😢
I feel so much sadness and you'll leave a void that noone can fill sadly but I w8sh all the best for the future Jurgen and thank you for the memories and God bless.
Enjoy retirement klopp changed Liverpool into a dominate team competing for the league for 6+ years 3 champions league finals the best manager
I love this man and once again he will go out on his terms with the full love of the supporters. Wonderful man and manager you will be missed.
We will miss you❤ for ever a club legend
Love you Jurgen ❤ Thankyou for everything you have done for this club. We will miss you and remember you forever ❤ Lets smash this season and make it the greatest goodbye to remember 💪 YNWA! IN KLOPP WE TRUST! ❤
I'm an Arsenal fan and I used to love watching Klopp's Dortmund. Seeing him go to Liverpool and achieve great things was a bit bittersweet, but the prem will greatly miss him.
9 yrs and F all won, nothing back to back
this is very sad new his a lengend we will miss you very much klopp 🙏
wow
Your era will ever be remembered, what you have done with Liverpool is immense and will stay in our hearts for ever. Live well Boss❤
Thank u for everything klopp😞💔but this too much for me ngl
So proud
thanks for everything JK. YNWA
❤☘
We love you Jurgen
I couldn’t be more thankful for this man to manage our club. I’ve never met him, but the connection that he built over these years, I thought was unbreakable. Hearing this now, in the middle of a successful season, it gives me unbearable pain to know that he’s leaving. I was already a Liverpool fan when he came in, but what he did exponentially grew my passion and my support for this team. I remember staying up for THAT UCL Semi Final against Barca, easily one of the best nights of my life. Just knowing that there won’t be another deep UCL run with Klopp at the helm is painful. I just started bawling when I heard the news, because it marks the end of an era for this historic club. He’s the best manager any of us could’ve asked for. We wish you a great future, Jurgen! YNWA ❤
Heartbroken My boy Jurgen 😭😭 I will miss you before every game 😢😢
You was suppose to leave with Ali, vvd and salah Jurgen 😢not leave so suddenly 😭🥺 no more champions league games at Anfield and after how the last game ended this hurts 😢it doesn’t feel real but it is 😩😥ynwa jurgen thanks for everything the normal one 😊we wish you and your family well, it still hurts 10+ hours later 😢
im a West Ham fan and obviously Liverpool have inflicted unsurmountable pain on us over the years but this guy has shown so much passion he has built a formidable team without spending silly money , really hope you win the League, League cup , Fa cup but give us the Europa league , Great club with passionate fans
Jürgen is and will always be the boss. What a legend... I can't wait to see him prosper, in whatever terms he sees fit.  He did LFC and every & each supporter (not just of LFC) all over the world an incredible duty, showing what passion and engagement can do. YNWA and Danke für Alles <3
Tears in my eyes 😢
우리의 영웅 그 이상 이 사람을 어찌 표현할수 있을까…….  20대 그와 함께했던 것이 나에게 행운이고 행복이었다.  이제 기나긴 꿈에서 일어나야 할 때가 온건가 싶다. 행복했습니다. 어디에서든 행복하시길 바랄께요
Poor man looks exhausted 😢 Best Wishes from Newcastle.....
Kloppo ❤
KLOPP...I AM 56 YEARS ALSO TOO ! ....BUT YOU CAN;T LEAVE US NOW....NOT NOW BUILDING A SECOND TEAM 😭😭😭😭💐👍🐐⚽I HEARED THE NEWS THIS MORNING ....I AM STUNNED...YOU JUST KILLED ME (EMOTIONALLY ) BOSS ....BUT I RESPECT YOUR WISH....YNWA🐐⚽👍💐💐💐👏😭😭😭🙏🏻
No klopp,,, no liverpoool fc. I know most of the people will say club is the most important thing...but for me Liverpool ends with klopp,,,especially when the departure is so abrupt,,, but for me Liverpool ends with klopp,,,nothing personal but from day one when we got klopp I was onboard but to imagine a Liverpool without klopp is not for me,,,you see I am a weak hearted person,,,but it doesn't mean I will stop Liverpool,,,the most important thing I love in this entire world,,,,but klopp saying he won't be able to give anymore for Liverpool means I cannot give anything more to Liverpool as well,,,I know liverpool will reach new heights and reach extraordinary levels but I just can't see anyone Liverpool being managed by somebody else other else. I know my heart breaks while I am saying this but just to let you guys know I  have always somehow subconsciously synonyms Liverpool with klopp. Call me childish, call me fake but it is my decision. To the special one, not the normal one, I go where you go. It's probably unprecedented to say this, but sometimes an individual is more important than an entity. I hope the supporters will understand. But I am just following my heart. I just cannot see a Liverpool without klopp. Till then good luck and may you guys reach unparalleled success. We will never walk alone. The club binds us in more ways than you guys imagine but this is what life throws at you sometimes and I thought I will be ready for this but I am not. And I will never be. To klopp, we accept the decision. But also we want you to accept our decision as well. My gaffer, my boss, we just want to thank you for what you brought to our life. We will never forget you and we will never.
He changed the entire culture and ethos of the club, He changed the mentality of the whole city, He changed how the premier league plays football to make it more entertaining and explosive for the whole world to see, He changed lives, He put honesty into a dirty fake world like football,  He won it all, He won all of our hearts.  This was Jürgen Klopp ❤  YNWA
He looks tired haven't slept much. Reminds me of when i quit my job and knew exactly why i was doing it. Glad and happy for him and thank you for the memories.  YNWA
Jurgen you will be misses man!
Long ago it would be crazy for some people to be devastated over a manager leaving, but when i received the news i didn't believe it,  this man has been more than a coach, i used to view him as a fanbase's godfather. We will remember him for his success at Liverpool, but the real one's won't forget his passion, him being human more than being a celebrity, his character, when things went south he assured us to be stronger and overcome the storm, we knew he would leave but this news has come all sudden, despite expecting it still hurts.  Special things don't fade away, the memories are in us. Back in the day,  the club was blessed with shankly, us young generation were blessed with Jurgen.  He is worth a statue, we are glad Jurgen is a RED! We walk on through the rain.
"how can i look for my glasses when i dont hav glasses" after that comeback against Norwich city back then... and he now doesnt need the glasses at all...wish he had them to see how much we love him... we love you klopp...thanx for all the memories uve given us...hopefully whoever comes in builds on that
Dear Kloppo, your eyes tells us everything. You will never ever walk alone and forever have our love and support ❤ Thank you for the memories  Thank you for the smiles Thank you for every single detail you put into this club. ❤YNWA❤
Love this man. Authentic man and a superb manager. From a United fan. Wishing he wins #20. He deserves that farewell.
Jurgen we love you so much! Thank you for the service to our club. It is impossible to put into words all the things you have done for Liverpool and how you have made Liverpool fans feel!!
I used to always say to myself that with all the extra miles, he goes into making sure that everything is perfect. Does he have a space & the time to himself?
Take a short sabbatical,  re-charge, re-energize and we will see you back in a couple of years 😊🙏🏻
well, he heard the Klopp-out clown brigade last yr and the hurt must've been real.. he fixed things up this season as we all knew he easily could, put Liverpool back on top of everything and now he's walking out.  Now, how do we get rid of the Klopp-out clown brigade from associating with Liverpool football club is my question.
YESSSS!!!
A legend at three passionate clubs, always knew when to  leave, I remember the tears at Mainz, he was younger, owed the Club everything and cried his eyes out, barely able to speak, professional and moving farewell at Dortmund before the yellow wall for a good reason. Wanted a sabbatical which lasted 4 month. Then the perfect match for this "Menschenfänger" compassionate 24h football maniac. An absolute idol wherever and whatever he did.. Even as a pundit while an unknown young coach at Mainz during de 2006 WC he revolutionised football commenting with his energy, knowledge and compassion. I know Jürgen and I can not believe he can stay away from football for a year, He loves it to much. There is a logical step we all know and the whole of the German football community longs for. Our NT has lost its central role in the German society in a polarised community. They are a laughing stock nowadays, something I have never experienced in 50 some years. He is the right one, he will invigorate the deep bond between the country and the Nationalmannschaft with his impressive personality and turn everything around. From daughters to believers again. The current coach has a contract till July 2024 and will not survive the preliminary round all likely. If he looses the friendlys against France and the Netherlands it could end sooner. Then Rudi will take over again reach the final and stay as long as Jürgen needs to chill
Best Trainer Jürgen klopp I hope that Xaxi Alonso dont come to liverpool
Maybe Ted Lasso can take over in the summer.
I’m a United fan but my heart is broken hearing this news…the league won’t be the same without u Klopp💔
Jetzt mit dem Gewinn der Meisterschaft, Liga Cup, FA Cup und Europa League abtreten. Jürgen ist die letzten Jahre um die Augen stark gealtert. Ehrenbürger von Liverpool zu sein ist eine große Ehre und zeigt die menschliche Stärke. Willkommen zurück in Deutschland.
Jürgen, das ist der Grund warum wir dich in Dortmund immer noch lieben und vermissen!👍 Heja BvB!
Thank u 🙏🏼
jurgen that was so hard to watch you say good bye i am truly devastated as a mad liverpool fan , you have given us so many fantastic memorys ,  thankyou for every thing you have done for this wounderfull club you will be missed ,  jugen you are the epitome of a caring father fiqure to all of us fan s and the players , i sincerly hope that you and your family find the qaulity time together  . you will never be forgotten jurgen  YNWA    takecare normal one
YNWA
Thank you Jurgen. Thank you for reigniting my love for this game as it had started to fade. Thank you for the memories, the ups and downs all the same. Although the downs were so few.  You allowed me to see my childhood dreams come true and I will forever be grateful.
The knowledgeable, having lost their sense of awe, seek to be entertained. Losing themselves in that process, they turn to more knowledgeable authorities.  Do not make light of what is important to people, and they will respect you. Therefore, The Master, although she knows herself, she is not arrogant. She loves herself as she is, but she also loves others as they are. She has nothing to teach, and the knowledgeable have nothing to learn.
❤ We are Liverpool ❤
Will he leave for good or just take a break and then come back to LFC?
Hi I'm princewill onyedikachi from Nigeria. I was shocked to hear the news and I felt bad thinking if the management irked you. However Jürgen thank you a century time, you made me really proud to be a Liverpool fan, you brought smiles and made me believe again, heroes come and go, but you will always live in this club. I'm proud of your achievements given less on transfer than your main rival pep.but you still made it happen.thank you Mr normal guy.more success for you and any club you join I will be your fan in a thousand life time.
Please come to barcelona.
Leeds fan here, have to say his impact reminds me of Shanks, obviously he starred at a higher level Shanks did but Klopp definitely got your club off the floor regarding challenging for the top honours. Hope it ends well for everyone involved cos it should. MOT
😊best manager
I hope be not ill.  He looks gaunt.  Maybe his wife ill.
😢😢😢😢😢
If these players didn’t win the league for him I’m selling them all. Salah Trent Allison konate Robertson and van dijk are untouchable of course. Diaz is first on my list
next germany nationalteam manager
The normal one , the best of the best managers, the deepest sense of a human heart with all the normal reactions to something as it must be ❤❤❤
No one denies Jurgen Klopp’s work in the previous period with the club, but Klopp goes, players go, departments go, and Liverpool remains forever. Whoever encourages a coach or player must go with him, and whoever loves Liverpool stays with him forever. This is the year of life. No one continues.
Love you klopp, the best manager to ever grace this earth. ❤
what happen.  suddenly ....? he could do it end of season  .Hope it does not effect team and result
Er war 8 Jahre bei Liverpool und sieht 20 Jahre älter aus. Zeit für eine Pause.
He build a team out of nothing unlike Pep….a Liverpool legend they need a statue of this man…YNWA Jürgen❤️
You'll never walk alone, Klopp... we'll miss you
😢😢😢
It feels like I’ve lost a brother and a big part of me is missing, Wherever he goes,he will always be Liverpool ❤❤
I’m a Man Utd fan but Jurgen Klopp has been 1 of the best managers in the premier league in years and he’s an absolute class act. All the best Jurgen
Very sad news! YNWA Jurgen Klopp. Boom!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤
As a Manchester United fan I'm actually gutted to see him go his inspiration his desire to win his tactics everything about this man screams winning I'm sorry to Liverpool fans as it's sore cause when we lost sir Alex it was hard sorry to hear this Jürgen I wish you all the best in the future
You absolutely rocked it for our club, boss! We are so grateful for all that you do. Thank you!
Is there a young manager out there who has great communication skills,  who is willing to let go of their Ego to become Klopps assistant for the rest of his time and maybe take over after shadowing and learning his craft, while developing their own style also.
Pretty dam genuine there, I think the troubles took a lot out of him and I expected him to leave last season but he turned things around and I genuinely believe he wants a rest but I also believe he will be back and he knows this, most likely as Germany manager or maybe just maybe England manager. Thanks Jurgen, no denying you gave it everything and more.
I am devastated.  I was always a Liverpool fan, I identify with ynwa and I always enjoyed the team.  but jurgen made me love this team more with the way he plays.  Thank you Jurgen from the bottom of my heart, thank you for making me love this great club more.
Yes, I am a grown adult man crying my eyes out
the main question is. will you give your teeth back?
From a United fan, I absolutely loved Klopp at Liverpool, from his first game in charge. I remember sitting with some friends between classes, in our Canadian university, discussing Klopp being hired to Liverpool.   I remember telling the guys “if Klopp manages to sort out the defence, they will have much success, as scoring doesn’t seem to be a problem.”   Did he ever sort out the defence, and then some.   You could immediately tell by watching Klopp, he had “it,” that something special.   Forever a legend in Merseyside and in the history books, of LFC, PL, and football.
hes not well is he
What an intelligent, humble man. Jürgen Klopp may just be the most inspiring leader we currently have in the UK. Not just in football, but society as a whole. Good luck for the rest of the season 👏👏👏
Winning and loosing is the part of the game, but im telling you, he’s the only guys who has potential to fight head to head with pep’s nearly billion dollars playing XI!
He's such a legend and we love him 😢   💜🫂 YNWA
Man, first Nick Saban at Bama and now JK at LP.....this is truly the winter of my discontent :(
On Talksport today someone phoned in and said he’d prefer that his wife leave him than Klopp leave LFC 😂
Why now .this is so upsetting their has to be more to this .klopp wouldn't just leave .   Surely salah will be going to saudi now .
I'm 100 percent Barca but Klopp is an absolute legend. Firmino, Salah and Mane...amazing trio. Klopp got me to keep a special place in my heart for Liverpool.  Thanks for all the memories and best luck. It will be a sad moment seeing him coach his last game.   Much love ❤️
Genius aside, he's just a lovely man. He deserves a rest if is he wants one. Massive respect JK ❤
Top Bloke 👏
Crikey, that was so hard to watch. We will need to look forward and search for another Klopp style manager.  There isn't one. 😢
Du bist eine Legende, hör bitte nicht auf zu trainieren.
They will be songs sung drinks drunk. Your name talked about in the same breath as Bill and Bob. Thank you Mr klopp for some of the best days of our lives. YNWA
He take a break! And don carlo extend a year contract. Once don Carlo left Madrid, we bring on him, to bernabeu!
We are so grateful to have him for as long as we could. No better way to leave your legacy behind than going out on your own terms. We will enjoy the rest of the season and cherish each game until his last, thank you Jurgen Klopp YNWA ❤
The greatest closing statement possible. Let's make 2024 special and give the man the send off he deserves. Up the fucking reds!
Great geezer.
It’s the fans from outside Liverpool ( wools ) who moan at players after one minute who the club give tickets 2 and all the foreign fans who don’t know offside killing the stadium atmosphere absolute joke broke our hearts he’s a true scouser
❤❤❤❤❤
toll kloppo, ich respektiere deine weise und mutige Entscheidung! Strakt guter Moment! Das schaffen nicht viele in Leben. sehr gut und Danke!!!!
He’s making sense  Going out on top is very very rare in today’s game  Good luck boss 👍
Thank you boss All the best
Thank you Jurgwn. YNWA
One of the GREATEST EVER…..💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
😢😢😢
He’s ill 😢💔💔💔💔 life is more important than football!! Whatever is wrong I hope it heals fully and he can enjoy his life after!! There’s deffo something he’s not saying
congrats for the courage to be this open and honest. thank you for everything. you will never walk alone :)
🇱🇦
1:10 in. I think he’s poorly. He doesn’t need to say it now but at some point in the future he will need to say something. That’s what I got from that
I will never forget his 4 goals against Erfurt 1990
Maybe you stop liverpool I don't like you stop love you
It would be a dream for me for you to stay, but I also understand your reasoning klopp. We will miss you.
All the very best Jurgan I hope you find the feeling you desire thanks for your time and hard work, there will I’m sure be a home for you in the city for ever!
Sad news....Klopp single handedly made me interested in watching Liverpool again...he has this aura about him...he'll be missed and will leave a big hole....let's hope the players give it their all for him as a leaving gift
Gutted he is going.Ive nothing but respect and love for the job he has done.Great manager and an even better man.I wish him all the best
Couldnt of happened to a better club ! F**K KLOPP
First and Foremost Thanks Jurgen Klopp ❤👏🏾❤️ Yu are Definitely A Great Human Being.

Liverpool kembali ke setelan pabrik😢
Ich bin Dortmund Fan und kenne eure Gefühle (lFC). Ja es ist ein Risiko wenn Klopp kommt da er ein mitreißt , und begeistert. Ich wünsche euch viel Glück Liverpool. Aber die Wahrheit ist leider das in Dortmund bis heute noch ein Loch ist seitdem Klopp gegangen ist😢, und ich glaube das wird euch auch nicht erspart bleiben. Viel Glück für die Zukunft nach Klopp
Impossible to replace, the man the character and of course the manager. Best in our generation. Calling him a legend will be an understatement. He promised us trophies walking in and delivered. His tactics and style is special yet he calls himself the normal one. An amazing character who we will gravely miss. The team must step up and give him a proper send of stay on top of the league and the fans will be even more passionate rallying behind team no doubt about it. Ynwa Jurgen thanks for your service and all the joy u gave us.
We love you JÜRGEN NORBERT KLOPP  , THANK YOU FOR MAKING US ALL BELIEVERS
If Liverpool were molded into a man, this would be it
Thank you Jurgen  ❤
We love you Klopp 🫶❤️
legend
Mensch Kloppo...........alles Gute für Dich und Deine Familie
I feel the disappointment that he has for the owner who is very business oriented
Hahahahahahaaa yesss ! No more cheatingggg !!! BYE BYEE BYEEE BYEEEEEEEE
What a guy , we are gonna miss you , thank you boss for everything , i don’t gonna cry 😭😭😭😭, you are the best ❤
My manager, YNWA… 😢
klopp will always be a liverpool legend, I feel like everything he is saying is a life lesson, don't be scared to make decisions and changes to your life, its never too late
We LOVE YOU KLOPP💕
Absolutely gutted .  Thank you for all those great memories. Let's make the rest of the season one to remember.
He’s going to Madrid
❤
Absolutely a legend what he has done for this club what a manager but also what a great person absolutely will be very very missed i am so gutted when I heard the news I hope we can win trophies this season to thank a true legend thank you and I’m sure I and all the fans wish you the very best thank you for everything ❤️⚽️❤️
i became liverpool fan because of him, his stlye of football and the whole energy what a great guy !!
Rip liverpool  No jk no liverpool 😂
I have nothing but respect and support for Mr. Klopp. Sometimes we forget that people like him, the "larger than life" people, are just ordinary human beings, after all.  They just lucky to be blessed with extra-ordinary talents. But they just ordinary human beings, like us all.
Wonder if liverpool will do wat united done when fergie left time will tell
Thank you so much Klopp literally  always talk about you all the time and still will no mater what theres one thing is that i will never forget  you as we all once a red always a red and Jurgen i hope you live a healthy  lovely life and enjoy your time off thanks  for all are silverware  Jurgen YNWA❤❤
What a class act.  Such an honorable man.  The world should take note.  All the best to you Jurgen!  Well done!
You are a legend klopp thank you for what you have done you will be missed YES YES YES
I hope we can still see him manage somewhere like Germany so he doesn’t have too work too hard❤
😢
Chapeau!
All day I've been devastated and thinking why, I hope he's OK  but after watching that full video of pure honest and passion (dont expect anything else from klopp) I completely understand and respect his decision. It must have been harder for him to make than us fans to take. I'm just so happy and privileged to say, I've seen the team klopp made play on the tele and live..he will never go down in my estimation. What a human and what a loss, not just to us but for the Premier league. So thank you for everything you have done Jurgen.... YNWA
Legend
Thank you for all you’ve done for LFC Juergen, I wish you all the best for whatever lies ahead in your future. YNWA
Iv never felt so much sadness .. love Jurgen!! .. he's brought me so much happiness as a life long liverpool which i never recicved before he arrived. Dont get me wrong other eras have been good aswell but the Klopp era has been really special ❤❤
🥲😢😭
هاذاا الرجل له  فضل كبير لما يقدمه للنادي فهو بمثابة الاب الحنون لم يترك شي جميل الا وفعله شاهدناه وهو يداعب اللاعاب ويداعب المشجعين ويرفع القبعه للاعاب المسجلين للهداف لا انسى ابد فرحته عندما يسجلو هدفآ وتاثره وحبه الكبير لن انسى حركت يده بعد كل انتصار وهو يحي الجماهير في الانفلد  من القلب  لن انسى تحفيزه واصراره للاعاب لن انسى كم جعل النادي عملاق وكم تخاف كبار الانديه ياله من اسطورررره ياله من كبيررر  سيخسر النادي الكثير برحيله لقد احببت هاذا الرجل كثيرررا واحببت النادي ومايقوم به لطيف بكلامه ومتواضع انه الرجل العملاق يورجن كلوب ❤
Gutted to hear Jürgen's announcement as he has been a fantastic and inspirational manager from the day he walked through the door at Anfield. I have loved his passion and enthusiasm for the club, staff and players. A true gentleman and leader. Hopefully we can all get behind him and the team to give him the send off he truly deserves.
I think he is going to take Germany job before next World Cup.
a very extraordinary coach, a coach that I admire. Thank you to everything, coach. I hope you are always healthy, thank you
To think he has been robbed of the glory of two more prem titles because of city cheating is heartbreaking. A true hero and legend of LFC, start building that statue to unveil at his last game!!
I love it haha
KLOPP ❤
Deserves a statue .. what a gentleman.
I'm a Madrid fan, and I am heartbroken that Klopp is leaving. I studied in Liverpool for a year and a half back in 18/19 and I felt just how much he was loved by everyone in the City, and how he transformed the club and made people fall in love with it again, I can't even imagine how they must feel right now. The league has lost a legend, it certainly won't be the same without him.
Klopp ain’t every buying anything again in Liverpool .. not even a bottle of water ❤😂
PLEASE KLOPP DON'T GO 😭😭😭
😢
So sad news. Thought that he still one more year in his renewed contract. We will miss you Klopp
😢😢😢😢😢
Please manage PSG next bro
Good on you man. One of the best and the greatest of respect.
YNWA
YNWA
🥺😢❤️‍🩹🇹🇭
Today he announced we are going to win the quadruple in the most subtle way, every game we will be there for you Mr.Klopp yelling from roof tops and supporting our Liverpool.  Thanks for the memories.
Alright Mourinho in
Even though I am a lifelong Manchester city fan it still hurts to find out that Jurgen is leaving he is the reason Liverpool are first and I am literally crying rn
Ich als Fc Bayern Fan bin schockiert. Der nächste der für ihn einspringt wird es sehr schwer haben, diese Lücke zu schließen. Alles gute Jürgen und dem Fc Liverpool
I’m not a liverpool fan, but I really respect his passion and character. Such a humble genius. Wish him all the best ✊
The Style & the way Liverpool play football is a credit to Jurgen!
Klopp might join in German national team or any top national team because it's a different purpose.
I became Liverpool fans because of Jurgen …. Not because of the players, as a human being he is inspiring leaders…that’s why most all his team are the reflection of his leadership. Well this is not yet a goodbye but for sure you make me believe that a game is more than just a winning it’s beyond that. You deserve to do whatever you want to do in the future. Thank you Kloop for the very corner of the world
I am cry , like broken heart from loving true
Adored. Never ignored. Jurgen Klopp.
😢😢😢
🔥GOAT🔥
Thank you, Jurgen. You have no idea how much you gave us. Love and respect.
Jose Mourhino to take over.   Klop was worried about being sacked.
Knossi hat gut mit Klopp über das Leben abseits des Fußball gesprochen
These jobs are extremely stressful.  I don't blame him.  Some people would rather chill out as they get older.  He is rich enough already.
Best Manager ever
All i know is Klopp will be coaching LFC in the future again
Klop just one more season please 😭❤
adios amigo
🤔🤔🤔 ,,, YNWA
Can’t thank you enough Jurgen for everything you’ve done for this football club. It’s been an incredible ride and like you say there are still a few chapters left to be written. YNWA ❤
We love you jurgen
I bet he doesn’t leave
Just a sensational human being! ❤
Not a Liverpool fan but this man made the premier league more fun to watch and he is gunna be missed
Devastated😢
Why drop this bombshell on my wife's milestone birthday Kloppo....why?!😅 ,am happy for you though.A good dancer knows when to leave the stage.On the flipside,filling these shoes will be a big challenge for the next Manager but as always We are Liverpool!All the best from Australia
It will be sad to see Jurgen depart, but in the spirit of positivity he’s been promoting this year, what amazing foundations he has laid for the future of the club!   Watched quite a few pieces on the internet today and it’s just lovely to see such an outpouring of love and respect for what Jurgen has done for the club and his connection with the fans. YNWA JNK
Excellent manager but also great and honest person. Sad for us but i wish him all the best.  YNWA Jurgen.  I hope title will be ours this season.
- I,m still a normal guy that didn´t have a normal life and i dont want to wait until i am too old for a normal life.  Wow that hits different.
It's heartbreaking... thank you for everything boss! ❤ I'm really happy because I was here with you. I hope to say goodbye with a champions parade! YNWA ❤️
As a real madrid fan i hope to klopp be a coach for our team because he have a fantastic career for you
As much as I will miss you, I honestly respect your interview and reasons. You have 1 life and this is your chance to live it as Klopp. Thank you for the amazing years that you have dedicated to the club. We shall miss the hell out of you ❤
คุณทำให้ผมใจสลาย💔🥲J.K.
Wish you the best. thank you
26 Years in one club, rebuilding energy and teams without overspending, respect Sir Alex Ferguson!
I hope one day I have a klopp hug 😭
Allerhöchster Respekt für diese Entscheidung! Als Fan des BVB hast du uns zum Fan von Liverpool gemacht, die Aura und dein Charisma sucht seinesgleichen! Alles Gute für den Rest der Saison, nimm dir die Zeit, die du brauchst, es gibt noch andere (und wichtigere) Dinge im Leben als Fußball! Be blessed.
It’s really a sad moment
We LOVE YOU Jürgen! YNWA ❤
I’ve cried twice today. This man is everything.
I'm no Liverpool fan, but I wouldn't mind Liverpool winning the prem this year as a final farewell from this great man.
Doesn’t need to explain to me, he’s human, operating at the elite level of sport. A wonderful human, manager, who has brought great joy and pride to Liverpool football club and myself. Thank you so much for all the hard work. I have so enjoyed the last 9 years and will enjoy the time that’s left. YNWA ☝️
<3
As a united fan I was really jealous when Liverpool signed Klopp. He's been one of the best in the business for a number of years now and he deserves to leave on his own terms. Could have won more with Liverpool, but nonetheless did an amazing job - bravo!
This HURTS so much. This is a REAL dagger in the heart! This man brought me so much memories and game me some of the most amazing and beautiful experiences as a LFC fan. In some ways he meant more to me than certain people in my life.   What a man, what a manager, what a human being. Words can not describe the emotions man!
As a pure Real Madrid fan, this interview is opposite of everything I experienced thus far as a Madrid supporter. Jurgen, and Liverpool, have 100% of my respect, as previous rivals, and as a club. They treated this man like a god, and even after last season where the owners easily could have sacked Klopp, they kept him around. Long enough for him to make this decision.  We never had that treatment for Ancelotti the first round, nor did we have that for Zidane the 1st or 2nd time around. Neither did we have this type of interaction with our legends like Casillas, Xabi Alonso, Ramos, Navas, Ronaldo, etc. As a football fan, I admire everything Klopp has done for Liverpool, and deeply admire Liverpool and its fan for Klopp’s treatment in his spell here. I would love this as a Madrid supporter. We can have all the cups in the world, but we do not have this kind of relationship with any of our managers thus far. Things like this, make me want to support Liverpool as a fan.
😢😥😭🥲I have two major life regrets from Liverpool: 1. Peter James Crouch left Liverpool for another team. 2. Steven Gerrard left Liverpool. Went to another team, this time heard that you resigned from Liverpool. Another news from you makes me feel very sad and shocked by your news.
statue!
Thankyou for everything you've done for this club truly a legend and will be forever YNWA! sad to see you go I really hope we can continue to be successful without you 😢
The wife obviously spoke a power word after he lost the ring on the pitch.
Not even a Liverpool fan but this man shines absolute class. Top manager and even better person.
Absolutely devastated 💔
The best manager Liverpool has ever seen!
We won everything under him, only UEL is what's missing, I really hope we win it under Klopp 😢 thank you boss
Right from the start Jurgen said “ if you like I’m the normal one”, as time passed I think we all saw he was true to his word, the normal one! There’s certain human beings you meet, know , talk to, talk about that have an affect on you………….. apart from being your teams manager, Jurgen just understood people , and for that brought so much joy and humility we as Liverpool supporters rode on his emotions! For this we thank you……….. rest up, stay healthy, relax and enjoy what life brings to you moving forward . Thanks boss 👏🏽
Personally I don’t know how can handle my feelings right now when see Jurgen announces this. I mean, he meant so much for the club. He raised us up when nobody didn’t even count on us. He brought us back where we should be, he created the new version of LFC where nobody wanted to face. He changed everything, he is LFC saviour.   1 UEL Final 3 UCL Finals = 🏆 2 Carabao Cup Finals = 🏆 1 FA Cup Final = 🏆 3 Community Shield Finals = 🏆 Premier League 🏆 Europa Super Cup 🏆 FIFA Club World Cup 🏆  He teach us one of the most important lesson not only in football but also in life: “You have to change from doubters to believers”   We did it and conquered all.  Danke Jurgen 🙏🥲
Never thought this would happen. Icon. Legend. Thank you. We look forward to your statue!
life goes om Jurgen. we are proud to share the history with you
You had to monetize even this video. Seriously? Herr Klopp, not a minute too soon to leave imho.
Proper legend ❤
😢😢😢
God bless u klopp
What a manger Klopp is, You guy's must be absolutely gutted, Rangers fan myself, but i always loved watching Liverpool, especially in the early 80s in Europe, but that is a dull one having to replace Klopp, Lucky he build you a new team before he left, i hope he wins a couple trophies before he departs, good luck to him..
👏🫡❤️
Tidak bisa di terima ini terlalu berat
LEGEND ❤
I can’t believe this news😢😢😢😢
He’s the best manager in the world.
Even as a City fan, this man has made incredible contributions to Liverpool and has won everything possible to him. Danke Jürgen 🇩🇪
Will be missed ynwa coys
Some class behaviour from united supporters in here.  Well played.
No way….I heard it this morning,and it’s just …crushed my soul…?Can’t believe it.😢
Will be missed so much ❤❤
Arsene Wenger is the best foreign manager in EPL history.
Its so sad but he said one interesting thing: he is not the right man for lfc future, that is just something that he can only see that we , as fans, cant
Thank you for your honesty Boss!! You’re simply the best! Having the thought you won’t be there next year is very sad, but its not easy as a coach to get to the place where you know you don’t have the same energy anymore and when its not fun anymore you’re not doing anything for the team, fans, or yourself. Lets go one and win everything and do you proud! YNWA!!!!
I'm not sure if they are Liverpool fans but there are a group of people in the comments who think winning 1 PL and 1 UCL is not a big achievement. If the club had taken on any other manager, Liverpool would not be where they are today. Klopp is a Liverpool legend.
I wasnt expecting my day to end like this after this long day. Wow 😢😢😢, am shocked but I am grateful for what this man has accomplished at this club. He is a Legend.
Klopp..father figure❤
This man has balls. All my respect❤ Cheers from Germany and good luck for the rest of the season🍀🍀🍀
C est triste mais merci m klopp  vous restez le meilleurs❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dear Boss  We love you so much. You have given us everything we ever wished for. We will love you forever. It doesn't matter how we think of you when you arrive but how when you leave. Yes, we, Mainz, Dortmund, Liverpool and most of the world loves you. Mostly me. I'm crying my eyes out.
Legend...FOREVER💔
U're the Anfield Legend
Thank you very much. I think every part of our big red family wishes you the best of luck in your journey. If there is a day when you choose to come back, I hope managers will give you that chance again. But the door to our hearts is always open for you. Thank you for all that you did!
Had a unite fan the premier league is losing one of the best all time premier league managers it have been
I couldn't watch this video until the end. When I was an elementary school student, the more time my parents divorced and spent alone, I fell into depression. It was completely because of this club and you that made me laugh, cry and sometimes get annoyed when I was alone at that time. I am not from Liverpool, and I was not even born in England. In this faraway East Asian country of Korea, I was saved by this club and you. Even when I heard sarcastic comments about why everyone is so into Football clubs in other countries, It was clear. There was a firm love for you, the city of Liverpool, and the club. As time goes by, and I'm getting older, and I'm about to turn 24 years old, I'm heartbroken to hear the sad news. But if this is what you want, I respect it. Thank you, my hero Jurgen. I always support wherever you are. YNWA
YNWL ❤
Only pussios crying rn
YNWA❤ 🇧🇷
What a legend!  Unbelievable memories
Bro I'm so depressed right now, thank you for everything Jurgen Klopp,  YNWA.
This man cared. 🙌
Thank you, Jürgen!
Thank you Jurgen for coming to the premiere League ❤
Thank you Klopp, YNWA. Thank you for everything ❤❤❤
Top bloke total respect, up there with the greats, but we still got the rest of the season to finish so lets go full hog and win the f***ing lot. UP THE REDS!!!!!!!!
In an industry of firing and hiring, this legend has  not been sacked by any club, mainz, Dortmund and now Liverpool. Thank you sir.
Legend, thank you for everything, you reignited the  passion for football in so many people, including myself 😢 forever in our hearts ❤️
This is the saddest news since the death of Bill Shankley 😢😢😢 I’m lost for words.  He will always be one of us, today and forever.
never felt football heartbreak like this. Thank you Jurgen. What a man, what a leader, what a coach. YNWA
I think the best possible send-off would be for the current squad of players to go on and win the Premier League title once more.  That would give Jurgen a finish to his Liverpool Premier League career that he would never forget and would live long in his heart and the hearts of all the many supporters this club has all over the world.🤞
This guy has always been able to get the best of his players throughout all the clubs he coached. We have seen the players who left the club how they performed. Mane, Coutinho, Henderson, and Fabinho. Just to name a-few. He has an effective charismatic character that made all the players love him and perform up to the top standards. Good luck!!
Back in 2015 a LFC fan asked me about Klopp. I just said "He´s the best coach Germany has to offer" but in the back of my head I thought "they have no idea what will hit them. I´ve seen it happen twice already". What a legendary run he had with this club. Build him a statue, he made people happy too.
I didn't know a German man i've never met in my life would be able to bring me this close to tears. It's unreal. Will miss this amazing manager and human being.
Pria biasa yang membuat momen momen luar biasa, saya beruntung berkembang bersama era anda. Sendiri memakai Jersey Liverpool di tahun 2015, sekarang bersama istri dan kedua anak ku di tahun 2024. Sepak bola bukan segalanya, tp Liverpool dan anda adalah keluarga. Saya tidak suka patung, tapi saya ingin melihat Patung anda di Anfield. Terima kasih
❤❤❤  Not a Liverpool fan but Klopp is an outstanding person.
Thank you for everything, klopp.
man i am so sad 😭 Klopp was great 👍
He's just a brilliant coach, respect❤
YNWA❤
You have to look at this with your sleeves rolled up. Liverpool now need to get rid of him, and start rebuilding for the club, because the club now comes first, not Klopp.
We still need that 19/20 season premier league trophy parade.  The city of Liverpool needs to say farewell properly when the time comes.
As a Manchester United fan, the Premier League won't be the same without Jurgen Klopp. What a manager he is
It's so sad, I'm just crying now, I need time to accept😢
😢😢😢😢😢
Did everything the right way, always kept his head high, carried respect and competitiveness that rubbed on the team, damn😊
I know Bayern Munich would want him but Bayern would have sacked him last season. They are the hardest club to coach, even Real Madrid is more forgiving. So maybe one day lead Germany to another World Cup but Bayern Munich isn’t the right club for you.
Thank You Jurgen for fantastic Memories YNWA we will miss you
最高の監督 最高の男
my favourite coach, and nest coach of liverpool ever❤
Great manager and full respect from a bitter blue the only thing he ever did that pissed me off was running on the pitch for the origi goal but id av loved it 8f it was our manager but fair play lad uve smashed ot good luck up the fucking toffees tho 😂
Jurgen as a liverpool fan what ever you do we will always wish you the best. What a beautiful human being. His energy is inspiring. 🤘
J❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tussi ja rahe ho? 😢 Tussi na jao 😢
Who should replace klopp at liverpool
Hope it just an Ai video, thanks for everything Boss!
I only just found out that this isn't a rumour,I'm literally crying I absolutely love adore Klopp to me he is Liverpool, I hope the future will be the best for him and his family, my love to Klopp and the club ❤❤❤⚽⚽⚽ x
Damn
Best manager ever
These are going to be the best most special 30 games ever in my lifetime ❤Absolutely love you kloppo what a legend you are I just can't believe it.. birthday tomorrow and I'm going to be so down 😅. You've earned your break Jurgen facts
This hit me same way it hit me when messi leave barcelona
Be nice to see him take Liverpool to the prem title this season with a staduim packed with fans
Legend ☝️😮‍💨
I'm gonna say it. In 18 months' time....the new England manager!
Literal heartbreak all the best jurgen
I just hope we don’t become Like Man U after Klopp
This news has got Jurgen Klopp plastered on a lot of news articles , social media , etc , I’m not even a Liverpool fan .  But it did make me realise how uncanny Jurgen Klopp and Tom Selkeck look and give the same warm fatherly vibes they give out . There’s something about them
Thank you Boss, let's go out on a high YNWA 🥺
Wir werden dich niemals vergessen Klopp, eine lebende Legende, ein wahrer Mann mit dem Herz am rechten Fleck, ein Vorbild, ein Lehrer, ein Freund , ein Familienmitglied, ein Trainer ❤ mögest du bis zum Ende ein ruhiges glückliches Leben führen. Wir werden dich immer im Herzen tragen 💛🖤
What an incredible man.
Im still in denial... i will wait until that last anfield goodbye 😢😢😢 thank u boss ❤ ynwa
I like his jumper.
The only one to stand up to man city 🐐
Legend. We are with you, Jurgen! You deserve it all! YNWA 🎉
He looks old and tired, its the right decision to leave, he needs some time out.
i’m crying rn, but i’m happy for him thank you boss 😭😭😭 YNWA🔴
I’m cruushhed…but we understand!!!Legend!!
I hope in the near future, he finds it in his heart to at least do a stint as the director of the German national team.
😭 😭 😭 😭 we’ll miss you YNWA
SAD ....but lets go after Jose Mourinho . He always wanted to coach Lpool and he has caliber
لاترحل ارجوك
I never thought I would cry over a manger leaving Liverpool 😭😭😭
""But im the only one who sees the tank meter is going down."" My eyes full of tears right know. This words reminded me of the final scene from Terminator 2. Ur fan from Azerbaijan🙁
We need you your the best
For those that can remember, this is like when Shankly left the club, it's like a death in the family, it's shocking and devastating and will take time to process. Thank you for the ride of our lives Jurgen! YNWA
Jose mourinho
Thank you for everything Jurgen❤️
As a Manchester United fan, we have yearned for such a man to helm our club and become part of the family the way Fergie was. Klopp was the type of person every other club's fans envied. A top manager, a top bloke, and has always respected the institution he became part of.  Good luck Klopp.
Please go run die mannschaft 🙏
Jurgen is a red the next title for a biography
Don’t goo gooo🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭
💔😭
My eyes are like golf balls. Can't stop crying.
Boss!  Hard to see you leave! One of the best football managers of all time. The fist ✊🏽 The Passion The Hope The Desire The believe  Now that's football ⚽ But always remember, “YOU NEVER WALK ALONE" 🔴
Germany national manager🔥👍
Ich sehe seit vielen Jahren soweit möglich alle Spiele des LFC. Auch wegen Kloppo, den ich aus der Bundesliga kenne. Er ist für mich einer der besten Trainer. Ich wünsche ihm alles Gute für seine weitere Zukunft und werde auch weiterhin die Spiel des LFC gucken und hoffe, ihr holt noch viele Titel.
From a Forest fan, I feel sad also. Klopp is Liverpool, Liverpool is Klopp. For 8 years, they have been synonymous and it's hard to imagine Liverpool without Klopp. The charismatic man will be missed on the touchline and his match interviews, all the best for both parties.
this makes me sad
He was a legend not just in Liverpool but a legend in the sport. I wish you all the best Jurgen 🔴🔴🔴
Faiŕ do,s man youve earned the right to leave this club a true legend with youre head held high .you will be missed but this club is bigger than one man respect and happiness in youre life and god bless
I wasn't ready for this 😭😢
One man, One life and who can begrudge him a normal life and a rest from full on pressure at the highest level. He's given everything to Liverpool, heart and soul.   Jurgen has integrity, honour and honesty. Qualities that so many people could learn from. Thank you Jurgen. Thanks for the memories and hopefully some more to come before the season ends.  YNWA ❤
I can imagine the scousers will get behind klopp and the team for the run-in. It would be madness if liverpool go on another brilliant run and win the premier league. Klopp would leave with liverpool ahead of united in league titles.
Love you, Jurgen ❤️
i have so mch respect and love for you jurgen thanks! cheers!
Simply the best. And not just as a football manager. YNWA. Thank you.
What a legend he is LFC will never forget him and all the things he’s done for this club.he’s the best manager Liverpool have ever had.We will all miss him so much nobody can replace this man he’s like a father to all the players and has such good chemistry with everyone.We love you Forever❤️👑
I love you Boss ❤  Good luck and all the best. The memories and joy, the football. You gave us everything we needed and wanted. I love you man 😥. Thank you Jurgen Norbert Kloop ❤
Isn't just a loss for liverpool but a loss for the prem.... what a manager 🤝
Best of all time , top manager , top man , all the best jurgen !
I do not knw wat to write i am shock😂😂😂😢😢
Enjoy your time with your family, Boss...no one ever deserved it more! I was overjoyed when you arrived & if it wasn't for corrupt FFP-dodgers, you'd have multiple Prems & with a little luck, 3 UCL's. I knew you'd be the perfect fit for our magnificent club....& this is a sad day. But we have a job to do til the end of the season...go get the quad, boys.  Do it for Jurgen!
Gutted about the news but oh boy this manager made us believe 100%. Best of luck in the future, let's finish the season strong we can still win everything. For next season, if the new manager it's not Xabi Alonso I will be dissapointed. YNWA
Thank you kloppo for everything
You were the best manager we could have ever asked for. Thank you for so many unforgettable memories you have created for us. You will always have a place in our hearts. YNWA
why in this time?????????
As an Arsenal fan, I am relieved as he more often got the better of us. As a football fan, I am sad to see him go.  Top manager, top bloke.
I'm not a Liverpool fan, but I am a fan of Jurgen. You are a class act and a genuinely great man; the premier league and UK sport will miss you. I wish you the best in all future endeavours.
Imagine a footy manager meaning more then your loved ones 😂😂 u dont deserve a family pal
So the question really is do you wanna be right or happy, right now.
He turned us from doubters, to believers and left on his own terms.   Always the man is a living legend. ❤
No point in having all that money and not enjoying it! Id retire if i had it.. makes me afraid to get to 56, not being able to go to work where i dont have to run and climb ladders
I'm speechless...
NO.
‘Because no one will sack me, I have to make this decision myself’ Now that’s leadership 🥹👏
Klopp is a real guy, very sincere and down to earth. He has earned my respect to the fullest.
You are a fine gentleman Mr Klopp. What Great memories you and your team have given me and my son during your time at the club. I wish you and your family all the best in the next stage of your life. ❤❤❤
For any supporters or anyone who respects our Boss...  The Umlaut (two dots) above Jürgen's (ü) name...  After we've typed J... press ALT and then type 0252... you will get what is called the Umlaut above the ü.  Jürgen...  Thank You brother!
I live in Ohio, and fell in the love with the club only a month ago, and I'm sitting here crying.... in my short time following english football, it didn't take me long to see that Klopp is special. Very sad day for this club.
Nooooooo😢
KLOPPPP 😢
This is the Jürgen the Korean National Team needs
END OF THE ERA 🫶🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹 THANK YOU BOSSSSSSS 💝🥹 THANK YOU MR. KLOPP 💝🥹
Ja reicht doch auch bei dem Tommys. Komm zurück 😂
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Liverpool and Klopp were made for each other 💗 !! Nine years is a long time at this level!! Especially the 2019/20 season !! World champions, english champions , European champions!! What a MANAGER !! We wish you well and your lovely family !! You will never walk alone.
We will miss you Big Boss. YNWA!
I’m a Man U however I salute him such a great manager and a great person. I wish him well and whoever you support we will all miss him because he is one of the greats of all time.
From a Bolton Wanderers  fan , Jurgen , LFC Fans are purley amazing , Jurgen by far 1 of the top 3 managers on this planet   , appreciate how gutted you are losing  Jurgen  , he is a  True Gent & Legend .When we lost  Big Sam we felt same  .....  Keep the faith .. YNWA
Lieber Jürgen, erhol Dich, nimm Dir Zeit…. Komm aber bitte irgendwann heim und sei bitte, bitte unser Bundestrainer. Ganz Deutschland liebt Dich und wir freuen uns so oder so auf Dich ❤
Bless you Klopp for what you have done
Thank you Jurgen for the memories
Damn I'm spurs fan ...this news hurts bad
This is not just the greatest coach of our time but one of the greatest minds and personalities I have had the pleasure of supporting. No one will replace you. You have been liverpool for me as you represent everything about us and yes the club is bigger than even you but you will leave a space that no one will ever fill
I absolutely understand that. But this decision shatters my LFC identity. As a German footballer from a young age and now aged 60, I have always followed Jürgen Klopp in the Bundesliga, he made me an LFC fan. I can't imagine the coming season. It will never be the same again. I'm sorry. At this point, I feel empty. I wish LFC had won a few more finals that the manager got the team into from the start. The hardest was losing to unfair Real Madrid MFs. They overcame that, then the defeat  against Barcelona and the comeback at Anfield will forever remain in my heart as legendary. Thank you Jürgen Klopp and good luck for the rest of the season! 🍀🍀🍀
That's devastating news.The fact that This feels so sad only highlights How wonderful his time as manager has been. Lets enjoy the final months, because i dont think well Ever have Someone quite like him again.
Thanks klopp but iam crying now i will miss you our hero 😭 we will miss you ❤
We will miss you
There's a lot of talk about how he must be "unhealthy", and he speaks against it. Health isn't just physical though, it sounds like the job is emotionally and mentally unhealthy for him. That's a valid choice too. I can't imagine the levels of stress involved in being at this level. Best of wishes to you Kloppo.
Saddddddd😢
Jurgen was like a father to the team, and to us also. In all honesty I still cannot imagine Liverpool as it is even if you gave me ANY manager at the moment. I feel lost...
You will be missed, but never forgotten. Thank you for everything you've meant to this club. Absolute legend. YNWA
forever will be remembered as a legend that always had plan and did everything for the club
Premier league will miss you sir Klopp you earned your name to be remembered always
All the leagues, all the cups we're in... the whole damn place is gonna be awash with RED!  I say we ALL campaign to have a new shade of red...  Jürgen Red!
Im a utd fan. what a manager but what a great bloke good luck for the future
Have a lovely day lads 🤣😂🤣😂
Is he leaving for ever or will come back
A.I is getting crazy these days...
Jürgen... you are there anyway but now you're really up there with Shankly, Paisley and King Kenny! We owe you EVERYTHING Boss. What you've done for us is a debt we will always owe you... always! You're home is Anfield... and please remember... you NEVER have to knock!
Today my wife left me but klopp leaving is even a bigger loss 😢
😢
You'll Never Walk Alone Boss... we're walking with you... every step... every breath!
End of a legendary era. Best of luck Kloppite.
Im a Benfica supporter but ive fallen in love with Liverpool since he took the job. One of the best ever and with an influence on todays football that is untouched. No one knew the concept of gegenpressing or metal football before him and his Borussia Dortmund team. Now everyone adopts it,even on video games. A legend of the beautiful game. Thank you for everything you have been given us for the last two decades. You have our respect.
He is the man, ever....❤
the most important interview in like a decade and you messed up the audio level
I BET HIS SETTING UP A REAL MADRID MOVE…. SEASON 25/26 HE WILL BE ANNOUNCED AS REAL MADRID MANAGER…. JUST WATCH.
As a Real Madrid fan I have nothing but respect and admiration for Klopp. As a human and as a coach, he is just great. I love how down to earth, honest and emotional he is. Truly a star coach! I am sure he will be dearly missed and eternally loved! All the best to him and Liverpool.
As a Man U fan I’m sad to see him go, always liked the man. And what a great job he’s done. Going to be a big loss for Liverpool
YNWA!!!
A phenomenal human being. YNWA KLOPPO XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Klopp is literally my family, love this guy and will miss him alot.
What a man! I feel absolutely privileged that you managed our club Jurgen. The greatest of luck to you and your family for the future.
Im united fan, but always admired him. Great manager, well spoken always.
Cheerio cheerio Cheerio👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
If what he says is true then he's going to be the next England manager..
😢😢😢😢 Living Legend
You‘ll never Walk Alone
❤❤❤
Gutted, he's leaving but wish nothing but good things for this man 100 years from now his name will still be getting sung on the kop legend thank you
Sad to hear that 😢, respect and love to this great man, thank you Jurgen klopp, wish you the best.
I couldn't believe it. The club won't be the same. Wherever Jurgen goes on his next Journey, he'll Never Walk Alone
Legend❤ YNWA
Hahaha seeeee yaaaaa 👋
Nooooooo 😢😢 thank you for your time at Liverpool
Class until the end. Telling the public early is honourable and the right thing to do by the club and the players. Liverpool have time to prepare, think, talk and choose the new leadership structure. The boys gain insperation to finish the season strong. Jurgen is honest about where he stands, he left us a super team in a great place. An absolute man of integrity. Thank you for everthing - your time at Liverpool will never be forgotten.
My God , What a man, An absolute privilege to have him as our manager ❤ YNWA ❤️
Such a world class manager, we will miss you ❤
Yep. Sad day not just for Liverpool fans, but I think for any true fans of the game. Got to love the guy. Thanks Jürgen for everything and have a good break you deserve it!
هاتوه يدرب منتخب مصر
Not a single negative comment! This is the proof how everyone loves him
Who knows what the future holds. Maybe some years down the line, he comes back. It has happened many times. Either way, thanks for all the great moments. Hopefully, we can add another 4 trophies before the season is over.
Good luck my friend!
What an absolute legend! The man is a warrior poet.  My favorite manager, in any sport, of all time.  Thank you for all of the memories.  Let's finish the season out strong!
A legend simple.
Jurgen. We love you so much. You have inspired and moulded a new era at Liverpool. We will miss you like a son. We are crestfallen at the moment but time will heal. I hope your health is good and that you and your wife have a terrific time recharging batteries. YNWA
The man United job will be open in the summer
Great guy..
When the shock has subsided I believe we will thank Jurgen so much for his honesty in coming to this decision now.  Imagine him having a breakdown in the middle of next season and the club being thrown into a panic.  It happened under Kenny in 1991 for entirely understandable reasons but as we know that was the beginning of thirty years in the wilderness.  At least the club has the time to plan well in advance however distressing for the rest of us.
😢😢😢. All the best  Sir we will miss you at LFC.
Shame to see you go. Thanks for everything you have done at Liverpool, and good luck and best wish in your future endeavour 👍top man
A true man! Taking on the decision himself for the best interest of the club…… leaves as he arrives 1000% Liverpool….. Thank you and let’s go Liverpool! Do it for Klopp ❤️🙏
I feel sorry for him. I mean football is such a dumb sport, of course he was fatigued managing a team for his entire life.
I’m crying… 😭😭
Thank you for everything you’ve done for the club, city and fans .. apologies for the 4 letter word .. city 😂😂 Wishing you all the very best for the future YNWA LEGEND!
This man is a special human being, that amount of detail explaining his mental health even though he clearly don't understand his state of mind and his empathy for the heart ache that we are or will be experiencing after his departure, the amount of charisma is next level, I will forever love him, miss him and admire the quality of Herr Klopp, YNWA ❤
👏🏼👏👏🏼
Always a legend! Always a red
So sad😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Nah... Me too, can't believe with this news. It's just an early April fools.  Let's me dream again with u  kloppo and LFC.. I never walk alone, right... Sad😢
Good on you jurgen. Youve been amazing for us. Time to put your health first. Football isnt more important than life and health. Thank you ,  it was an honour to have you at our club and lets hope we give you a quadruple send off.
I Love 🩵
Thanks for everything you have done for the club. You transformed the club. YNWA ❤
Can anyone else read between the lines?  This Lifestyle, and i say Lifestyle is because its not just being a manager, hes through his whole life and soul, passion, everything into it!!! And its cost him! He looks tired, and has aged. The magic he has performed to not only transform and complete and serial title contenders, with what he works with. I personally think something is seriously wrong. Either himself, or HIS WIFE, is seriously ill.
Translate in English... Liverpool seit einfach froh, das ihr Jürgen Klopp für eine Zeit bei euch haben konntet....! Es wahr ein einziger artiger Moment...so als wenn du einen Millionen Gewinn im Lotto hast oder beim Spaziergang einen Diamanten findest....! Sagt Danke Schön...und erinnert euch an diese Geile Zeit! ...His Guy is one of the Best German's What WE have....Bitte gebt uns Jürgen wieder ..! Wie wäre das.....Er würde nach 1 Jahr Pause .... Leverkusen endlich zum Meister machen .. Leverkusen, you know? Ist Liverpool in Germany... Leverkusen/ Liverpool......thank you
I don't feel emptiness because of war in my country. All emotion are muted for now. Thank you, Jürgen, for great seasons. For amazing team you lead! You was a perfect coach to LFC and YWNWA!  Whish you all the best. You are special. Thank you for heritage ❤ I dream to show Anfield to my son once.
There are many football "Politicians" in England today who do not want Liverpool to remain as the most successful team in England. United wants Klopp in order to weaken Liverpool but they should know that there are hundreds of Klopps who can continue and even perform better than Jurgen Kloop. I am disappointed in Klopp for allowing himself to be used as a  weapon to put Liverpool fc's football dorminance in  check.
What a great decision what a great human from Germany , respect respect !!
Top class mr Klopp . .
Man…I’m United fan and this guy brought tears to my eyes. What a great guy. Legend!
Best Wishes from Canada... HAVE THE BEST SUMMER EVER!!!
Man city Premier League Champions!
fuckin A. what a legend. i'll never blame you for leaving klopp. you gotta do right by you and your family first and foremost. Much respect for the way you've handled yourself over the years.
I really like it when Jürgen say I am a normal guy
He is saying health & I loved the team and all stories, SIMPLY he got big money from Saudi & leaving, LP fans would like to think other wise, but it's about the money, we will buy everything that you ever loved & respected. We bought players, we bought tony blaire & clubs & horses & custles & more to come.
Thanks for everything that you've done to this club, Juergen! Not only for Liverpool,  you added more colour to the entire football's world with your filosophy. Your legacy will always remind in football history. You inspire many people with your professionalism.  All the best for the next chapter.  YNWA! ❤❤❤
I’ve supported Liverpool since 2000 24yrs, and last 9 seasons was special Legend thank you Jurgen❤
FC Bayern München is waiting
True LEGEND !!!! You will be missed . Good luck in your next chapter .
“Minds write history”
Jürgen, you're the BEST coach for Liverpool, YNWA! THANK YOU FOR ALL HAPPY MOMENTS THAT YOU GIVE US! YNWA!❤️‍🔥
You are a Legend and Great manager😂
My word. Not one cliched spin. He never did use them, did he? To the very core, he is one class act. There are, and will be, tears. But that’s because the love is there - and I’m grateful and forever thankful that we are one of the few clubs that will ever have the honour of calling him our Manager. Thank you, Jurgen (and Ulla). I’m a teacher and have studied Jurgen’s style, passion and any clues about his coaching and motivational techniques. If I could emulate one fraction of positive influence that he can, I would be better. I’m honoured to see such sincerity in such a cut throat sport and league. And he’s ours. We got to see this man work his magic for our club. How utterly fortunate are we to be fans during the Klopp era? My heart is breaking, but it’s also full. Thank you so much, Jurgen, for being such a beautiful part of the tapestry of Liverpool’s story. ❤
He's going after the german national team job, no way Nagelsmann keeps it after the Euros
You Will NEVER walk alone! You Will be miased. You Will not BE forgotten...thank you for everything you gave us. Now lets win all we have to win!!! 😢
💔💔 YNWA
Ok 2024 That’s not a good start 😭😭💔
Disgusting club for ruining everything
Hes already thinking about a new club hes going to Spain 💯
It's to early for april fools. Right😅😅😅😅😅😢😭😭😭😭😭 But, no seriously, i feel so sad.
True but hard to swallow ..am speechless ,This kind of pain is just like the moment I lost my mum..
Forever in my heart, thank you so much Jurgen and LFC- YNWA ❤
Danke für all das was du für meinen BVB getan hast. Ohne dich und Aki wären wir nicht da wo wir jetzt sind💛🖤  Danke das du Liverpool wiederaufleben lassen hast ❤️🤍 Danke Kloppo! Legende für IMMER!
So who would we like next after Jurgen
I am so sad to see him go after getting to used to him he bought us so much silver wear during his stay if it wasn’t for city money we would have won more so I would like to say a big thank you to Jurgen for all the wonderful memories
😢 this is painful ❤ only love can hurt like this ..thanks for everything klopp YNWA
I think Klopp has a very important illness and he's going to take time to receive the proper treatment
Wow. The example of how you retire. On peak, with energy and pride. Requires intelligence and respect. I always liked Jürgen but now he became a legend in my opinion.
Damn
You know you are legend when even your rivals fans are shocked by you leaving.
Jürgen Klopp is by far the most humble and nice trainer to have. He is so nice and gentle. Sad to see him go Had a tough time to not tear up beleve me that
Jürgen, vielen Dank, dass du in Liverpool bist. Du hast niemandem die Chance gegeben, zu glänzen und dir einen Spitzenplatz in der Mannschaftsliste zu sichern. Du hast die Premier League und die Champions League gewonnen. Ich hoffe, dass du am Ende der Saison erneut die Liga gewinnst.  Danke Jürgen
Nooooooo!  WOW I feel like I just heard someone has died 😭 I love Klopps personal his love of the game ⚽️🥇🏆 Thank you ❤
I love this Club, and I love your dedication to this Club. You remind us what Liverpool is. Thanks a lot.
That feeling of him leaving hurts. The best manager for Liverpool (in my time) Massive rebuild, won us trophies better then pep (as he actually had to rebuild the club from nothing to something) YNWA KLOPP!!!!!!!
Common 1 more year!! plsss
Very sad news, sad day ever as LFC fan.
Jurgen thank you so much for bringing us all joy over 9 years Thank you for helping us throughout hard times Thank you for everything  You are LIVERPOOL FC YOU ARE A RED FOREVER YNWA  Good luck on your future journey You will always be a part of our amazing club And a part of all Liverpool fc supporters families   You will always be welcomed at anfield ❤
All I can’t say is Thank You and I/we as a family wish you and your family all the very best.
Klopp we love you thank you for leading team to many trophies
How lucky are we to feel sad our manager is leaving. No calls to get him out etc - and never would happen, but this unique beautiful human came to us and breathed life into us. He will be remembered with the greats, and because of him HIM someone else will follow, but we walked a path with him and it was so beautiful and amazing.
You did us proud always and you owe us nothing , humble man .
YNWA❤️🥹
Take a break Jurgen if you need one,if you will one day recharged and will to come back...club should be open to it....ynwa ❤️❤️❤️
Will miss you Jurgen , Thank you for making us believe we can do it as a group ❤, You'll Never Walk Alone Boss.
Long live the King👑💪🏼
Danke Jurgen!
It's going to be a difficult last match day when the tears will be streaming down the faces of grown men. I salute you Jurgen Klopp and thank you. 🫡😥 x
Ha. They are so cooked now, innit! One last dance, Jurgie!!!!!
I’m a city fan but I don’t want him to go after him coming to Manchester and us vsing them in anfield Wish you well Jurgen
His next journey ( cause it's a necessity I think )...Die Mannschaft 💪🤟
Jurgen, you have made me love Liverpool more than I ever have . As a fully grown man, I am heartbroken. In my eyes, you ARE Liverpool and have done so much for the club and city. I followed you to Madrid for the Champions league and have been so proud to say you managed my team.  Your name will be an important part of this club forever.
He came as the normal One and will leave as a Legend. Jürgen will never walk alone.
Liverpool back to mid table 😂
Der ist bald Trainer in Bayern oder von der Nationalmannschaft. Alles schon eingetütet
Hate commenting on this video as I've dreaded this day. The man leaves every club he's been at heartbroken. I've barely eaten today. What makes him irreplaceable is who is he as a man. He speaks nothing but good sense which is exceptionally rare. Don't want to even think of the club post Klopp. "If I hadn't seen such riches i could live with being poor". Love the man.
Nooo
Psychologically, it's actually a benefit to the players, the crowd, the whole club! And cud also destabilise City or any Cup Final opponents! Psychologically the players will be even more determined for him to go out on a massive high! It's very smart timing.....just before the big push for trophies! It's sad, but it's also brilliant timing! 😮
Time to name a new stand. Call it The Klopp 😊
Jürgen, you are the normal one! Love!
Painful but that is life Until we separate the ways lets dance and keep banging \m/ till end of the season
Jurgen you really have no idea about our relationship. You will be adored for generations. Grandchildren will know your name because you changed the lives of their grandparents. Thank you for making us believe  Y.N.W.A
Thanx a million  Jürgen.  You'll be  sorely missed.
Great to have seen Klopp do his thing in the Premier league, one of the best managers ever 👏
Hell take some time off, and will work on several aspects of his life.  mental health and relationships). But, he will be back
WE HAVE TO WIN THE QUADRUPLE FOR JURGEN
😢
❤ so long Maestro! Much respect for you Sir !
Really I am crying 😢
JK  the lengend ❤❤❤
..... Walk on..... Walk on......  ...... YNWA......
Im shocked!
Now you all know how i felt as a bvb fan 😢
In tears 😢
It takes great self awareness to realise your own body n mind is telling you enough is enough, time for a year out to rest! If anyone deserves some time to travel n enjoy his wealth, it's JURGEN KLOPP! The guy has expended more energy n emotion in the past  9!/ Years than most people give in a lifetime!! Legend! And I'm a Villa Supporter!😮
Brilliant man.
As a BVB Fan I feel with every Reds supporter. Believe me, I know exactly how it feels.
Klopp won what we asked for and im happy but im not happy about him leAVING IM SO SAD RIGHT NOW😢😢😢😢😢
I am so happy that I lived in the era of Klopp. Wish you nothing but the best in your life Kloppo and hope and wish that we will meet again!
I feel numb, my heart is truly breaking! Its the end of a golden era in our history 🤧😪 Guess we see him at the world cup with Germany then, and hate his guts. devastated
sign partition here to make sure klopp doesnt leave :((((
😭😭😭
We will remember to Klopp. Play out the season. Get that final win and go rest. Come back and give us an interview or 2 in the future. :)
almost 9 years in this club, i understand his decision but there won't be a coach like him (I don't believe so at least)  I'm sad tho, really sad
Take rest for 1 or 2 years and come back jurgen pls💓
Best of luck, Klopp. He will be a great motivational speaker, and I can already  foresee a Ted talk led by him.
Like a dream, this man meant more to us like our own family he give us a hope and he give us everything. 30 years broke the curse and become a king of a europe and until now he give us a hope to become a king of england again. We wil make a statue for all your hardwork
"It's not so important what people think when you come in, it's much more important what people think when you leave" You've been one of the best managers I've seen in the sport who loves the team and fans as much as we love you, you've ended Liverpool's trophy drought,  brought harmony in the changing room & thoroughly entertained us in your tenure.  It was an honor witnessing your greatness, thank you for the incredible memories Klopp.
puhh, what a strong guy. great respect from a Schalke supporter
Capitalism is an ugly thing we should start a serious lineup against ~ Klopp!  You are not perfect but you are one of the best. Yes you did mistakes in my opinion that led to major trophies slide the other way but you also managed sublime performances that definitely surpassed those mistakes, without these mistakes i think your fans would love you less. Cheers man and good luck , at least in this ideal world you would have stayed…….
It’s heartbreaking News 💔😱🤯he is the goat of the mangers🐐❤Thanks for everything klopp.
I'm not surprised at all! He looked broken n knackered last season! It's like Fergie at UTD who had a terrible season n looked worn out, so put everything into one final season.....scrapped the Title n left a UTD in a mess for someone else to sort out! At least He's leaving an amazing Liverpool team for Xavi Alonso! I think this team will win Champs League next season! 😮
Юрген тебе должны поставить памятник возле Энфилда❤❤❤
Im gutted he is leaving, I can totally understand though, how can you replace the greatest manager,I love him but I don't want Gerrard yet, he deserves a few statues and the kop should be renamed the klopp
Is this the apex of the Quitting Youtube fad?
We are love you, Kloppi❤
Absolute respect! There is trust in your decisions big man! Thanks!
Спасибо за всё! Вы лучшее, что происходило с нами за последнее десятилетие. Желаю вам крепкого здоровья и всего самого наилучшего в жизни. Навсегда в сердце, мистер Клопп.
I’m in tears man I don’t know when I saw it seems like he is not keeping well he mentioned his energy level cannot keep Up I feel Something is up
😢😢😢
I am lost of words... thank you Jürgen Klopp for always giving 100% for the club and always bring miracles to the club. You will always be loved by this club and no one ever is going to be able, to replace your shoes. Danke für alles Trainer!
In before Jürgen Klopp goes back to Dortmund, linking up with Jadon Sancho and bringing the best out of him, like Man United never did!
Thanks for everything, Jurgen. You've been great. Good luck for the future.
LEGEND
What a man! Not a lierpudlian, but he made me love this club
No matter what happens there should be an open top Bus through the City so everyone from the City and beyond can have a chance to should our gratitude for everything he's done for Liverpool and the City. With Jurgen his Wife and the backroom staff..... Thank you
Love you Jurgen!! You are a great man. Thank you for giving your all. Best for you and yours!
We will miss you Legend ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don't thank us, we have to give thank you. Thank you for all this 9 years of glory. Thanks Jürgen ❤.
New German manager
Enjoy ya money
This is great news kloop was ur Alex Ferguson now I can enjoy Liverpools years of struggling 😂😂😂
I rarely get emotional, but this made a tear 😢
What an amazing manager! What a great personality and speaker! I will miss you and always remember your time at Liverpool. God bless you, Klopp.
What a great person, we will miss you, love you klope ❤❤❤
If it’s not Guardiola, I want Klopp in my club, FC Barcelona.  I love Xavi and I don’t think he’s a bad coach, but we need a manager of the magnitude of Klopp right now.
Legend. Just take a year off.
absolute legend
Just remember what he did for us JÜRGEN KLOPP LEGEND 💕♥️❤️‍🩹 JUST LOVE BEST MANAGER
What a legend!! Thank you for everything Jurgen Norbert Klopp, let’s end the season the best possible way  red men🙏🏽❤️
I am still waiting to wake up so this nightmare ends...
This is the most beautiful interview I have ever watched. Honest, humble and so aware of the moment and what he should and not talk about. YNWA❤
Hahahahahaaa inabit
Thanks for everything, Jurgen Klopp. The journey we have been on has been absolutely magical, thank you for caring for and improving our beloved Liverpool Club. We fans appreciate the huge contribution you have made to Liverpool. You are a Liverpool legend, we love you. To be healthy. Thanks for everything boss
I am so sad to hear that Klopp is leaving.  A true red legend.
Literally been like family, I can’t. I’ve looked up to you a lot over the years as somebody who’s provided motivation and happy times. Been a role model to respect and learn from. Such a commendable human being. You are going to go down as one of the greatest managers.
Jurgen do it one more time please 😢
Am a Gunner but l'll always missing you in the PL.....
Thanks klopp for making liverpool great we will miss you 🤴
G.O.A.T 🔥🔥🔥
Transformed Liverpool from under achievers to one of the best teams in europe. I think he will become German national team coach after nagellsman, national team manager isn't as physically demanding as the day to day club managers job, If Germany have a bad euros tournament I think he will be appointed after the euros, that's just my opinion. He's won everything at liverpool, there's nothing more for him to do and I remember watching an interview with klopp a few years ago and he said the only job he would consider leaving Liverpool for would be to manage his country, I'm a spurs fan and I have to admit he is one of the greatest managers in world football, if not the greatest. The premier league won't be the same without him, very likeable and always enjoy his interviews. All the best jurgen, feel sorry for whoever replaces him, big shoes to fill!
Fair play, you've earned the right to do whatever you want to do and we'll still love you, but I really hope you've not gone too early and won't regret it. You've finally discovered the magic formula, because we're on such a roll, so it's a massive shame to stop now, just when everything has slotted into place again. The players who signed to play under you will be gutted too. This has a really weird vibe to it, tbh. Take some time and think about it before you make a rash decision you'll regret.
Absolutley love this fella , now I know how the generation before felt when shanks decided to leave . YNWA Jurgen .
It was the Gerrard era, then Suarez and Sturridge then the Klopp era, in my lifetime.
Premier league wont be the same anymore. 😢
Gutted
Jesus.. where to start with this?   Well I was having terrible family news 24 hours ago, to hear this and see this, my heart just dropped and I was in tears..  But I love that Klopp was honest and open about his choice and how he knows in his heart he has to leave.   But let's take the clock back to when he started, where he said, it's not about what happens when you start, but it's how you leave.   Jürgen is going to leave this club as an iconic, funny, joyful, passionate and dedicated manager.   Jürgen knows deep down he has soo much love for Liverpool FC and Liverpool city.  I am not going to forget that it was Jurgen made me believe in our club once again, to his monster mentality mindset, the memorable comebacks and the silverwear we won along the way.  The ONLY trophy I want to see Liverpool win is the Europa League title, so Jürgen can leave knowing he won EVERYTHING with the club. I would love it if this is now going to be a kickstart to say we are going to commit everything by 110% and win like the quadruple.   One more final say before I end this comment post.   Pep had the money to buy the players that already had the talent. But Klopp bought the players to become megastars for our club  Thank you Jürgen Klopp, god bless you. YNWA ❤️
There are a lot of managers who had many successes with different clubs. But there's only one guy who, whenever he left a club, made people cry.
thank you for everthing klopp we love you ❤ You'll never walk alone
As a City fan I hope he wins the PL this season 🩵
The fact that everyone want him show how talented he is 🙌🙌
Man City on top
Hands down u are the greatest Liverpool manager ever . No one has done what u have . Thanks Jürgen klopp we love you ❤
What a man! Good luck to him and LFC for the rest of the season YNWA
I'm completely respect your decision no matter what I will always respect you let's go win these trophies
As a Dortmund fan, I can only say that there is a time before and a time after Klopp. But the hottest thing is spending time with him. So enjoy it...he's not gone yet.
💔🥺
Ynwa💔💔
Respect for this man.
Can't imagine a team without him 💔🥺🥺
As a Man United fan I’d like to sincerely thank Klopp for what he’s brought to English football. Also as a Man United fan I’m looking forward to him joining us when Ten Hag’s contract runs out and enjoying Liverpool’s free fall in the mean time.
Jurgen was never the normal one , thank you for everything.
It will feel so empty without him, but I feel it's the right to leave now before it's to late for him. Love you and thank you Jürgen for everything. YNWA❤
Most likely Liverpool will go for De Zerbi.
If the board backed what he was asking for then he wouldn’t be leaving
They should have left tbe door open for Dalglish to return when he’d recovered.  Don’t make the same mistake again liverpool
I can’t think of a manager that matched the culture and energy of a club, like Klopp has with Liverpool. The way he turned around Liverpool FC and made all the doubters, believers. Brought so many incredible moments for us along the journey. Thank you Klopp, for bringing upon us the greatest era of Liverpool in recent memory..
May we all apply Jurgen's wisdom on life, career, relationships, family to our own experiences. He's coaching us all on how to be better people.
“Stay and they will end up building a statue in your honor, go somewhere else and you will be just another player(manager)” Jurgen Klopp
stay on as a active board member. don't go boss
Komm zurück nach Dortmund kloppo 🖤💛
Respect!
🏆 1 x Champions League 🏆 1 x Club World Cup  🏆 1 x Premier League 🏆 1 x FA Cup  🏆 1 x UEFA Supercup  🏆 1 x League Cup  🏆 1 x Community Shield  👏 Jurgen Klopp, the man who won it all.
Im still processing this news till hours later. so heartbreaking and i dont think this is a real official video, im so shocked 😩😢😭
Klopp has had to endure not only the high level of professionalism  which runs through him, as has been mentioned on many occasions...the corruption that runs through the top table . It must be frustrating knowing if he had been on an even footing with other foreign owned clubs in the Prem ( no names, no pack drill ) LFC would have had more trophies to show ! Good luck Jurgen, finish your swansong in glory
For all you Liverpool supporters, I'll just say this. No Steven Gerrard is not ready, probably never will be!
THAT CAME UNEXPECTED. LAST YEAR EVERYONE WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING BUT NOT THIS YEAR. I JUST REALIZED YESTERDAY HOW CRAZY GOOD HIS WORK STILL IS.
Thank you, all the best
I feel like he deserves to rest! It’s crazy world out there when you are stressed all the time. He will come back one day stronger and more energized! Give it time! Thanks boss!
I idolise this man and will continue to do so. Jurgen will always be My Manager  <3  YNWA
You have earned a break Klopp, absolute legend, a fantastic manager and and even better human being. You made us all believers
As a Madrid fan, I always enjoyed the El Clasico's we have with Barcelona. But every time we play Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, it just makes the game more beautiful. Good luck Jurgen and I wish you the best
Bester Mann, ein wahrer Charakter
IM CRYING SO HARD VERY HARD I LOVE U BOSS ILL BE IN THE STADIUM IN UR LAST MATCH
He's only 56? He looks a decade older. Maybe that's why he's decided to retire.
united fan here. Legend. Wish you the best Jurgen!
What a privilege to have had a manager with as much class and humility. Thank you for everything Mr Klopp. X
Fr the only reason I rooted for Liverpool was because of Klopp and what he did for this team, sad too see him go but I hope he can spend some time off from being a coach and live life like he should ❤
Thank you 🙏🏼 promise fulfilled ❤ Love you Jurgen Klopp
What a man,what a manager, what a legend, Jurgen klopp.YNWA
Extremely sad and emotional to hear the news
Sad to see you go nothing but love thank you for all the memories may God bless you where ever you go
Not sure if it’s the right moment to announce this half way through the season. I wonder how the players will react when they hear it and if they are going to give their best effort until the end of the season????
A team. You build a team. Not Ronaldo, Messi or a whatever. You build something greater - a Pool of everyting… a Liverpool. Where u feel it at home - when they do it right! When they fail… Liverpool- not Ronaldo - not Botaldo - not Kotaldo… Liverpool - to the end!
You call yourself a normal guy, Jürgen you are a legend, you have touched thousands of hearts, and made so many people's life better. Thank you
Thanks Jurgen Klopp, always a Liverpool legend, we will always love you ❤️❤️❤️ YNWA
Much respect for all you did for us and you will always be one of our greatest managers.
I am a Flamengo supporter, but I must say that Klopp is a very interesting kind of guy. I think I understood his point and wish all the best for him.
He was like a drug to us fans💔😔
Get Steve on blower....
They told him were selling Salah, and not reinvesting the 150mil we'll get... MBappe rang him to ask to join, and Fenway said no.
Legend !! End of chat 😊
We will miss you😢
Liverpool Legend, thank you for everything, we appreciate the contribution you have made to our club, God bless you.❤
What a decent man. Nothing but respect for him.  Truly the NORMAL one!
Farewell to the Goat🐐
He had enough so wants to move on. No drama.
I will miss Jurgen Klopp, but I can tell you that what he has done here at Liverpool will be remembered for years to come. LETS FINISH STRONG!! You’ll never walk alone Jurgen, thank you so much, you are a class act 🙏🏻🌹
What a guy, what a manager I'll be routing for Liverpool for the title from a Wolves fan!
As a United fan... I am glad! But big fan of Klopp and the way he has conducted himself throughout.
Good luck, enjoy your life Jurgen, you are 56 years old, go and enjoy life, people don't live forever. People, don't judge him. There are people who burn-out, he is not like Ancelotti, he didn't had clubs like Amcelotti. What he is saying, happens also to normal people when they realize their job is not making them happy. Good luck Jurgen and have a great life forward!!! Have fun and enjoy!!!
Wow yeah this bums me out but I totally understand how he feels and respect his choice but this one is a tough one for me YNWA
❤🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please please please stay I’ll pray for that ❤
Really hope he is ok and he is healthy
❤❤❤❤❤
Get him a statue what a legend sad to see him leave but we.have move on bye kloppo 😭😭😭😭
You will never be replaced Klop never
My eyes are red from crying. This man did so much for the team, He not only guided them but acted as a father figure for most of the players. There will be no one like him
All we could hope is his happiness and for Jürgen not to manage another club.
I haven't been able to completely finish this interview 😢
I'm a Birmingham city fan . This is a great loss
Mate heartbroken 💔
💔💔💔
The best rival manager ever 👍 (from United fan)
Yeah... he's preparing to become head coach of germany, it's obvious... give it a year & mark my words.
Absolute legend. Not a liverpool fan but always loved Klopp and his passion. Will be very missed 🥲🥲
First time i seen him not wearing liverpool clothes.. The conspiracy is over amd so is hes reign.
بالتوفيق للالمانى على براعته فى القيادة الفنية طيلة هذه الحقبة التاريخية ❤🎉
I hope you will have a peaceful life when away from Liverpool  Thanks jürgen❤😢
In Reality Liverpool is Nothing Without Jurgen Klopp😔
❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢
I knew this day was coming..but I dint think it'd be yet.  Lost.
YNWA... Thank you Jürgen..
All the best for you and your family, we are very proud of you. Lovely greetings from Stuttgart ❤️💪
The video cut after the freedom of the city question...That must have got Klopp YNWA
I don't know wether its me not understanding English or what... Im on 15th minute of the 24 minutes video and yet i haven't heard the main reason why he is leaving Liverpool.  If anyone can help me, i would appreciate it.
Danke Jürgen! Danke schön!
As a United Fan. Thank you Klopp for brining fun, intensity, amazing press conferences, stixking for clubs and players, playing high voltage football. One of the modern greats who has changed the way teams played.  Salute to you sir. Have a good next chapter. Will be missed dearly by all PL fans😢❤
I know understand why united was so sad after sir alex
We love you Jurgen. Thanks for the memories you’ve helped us make, here’s to the memories we’ll soon have.
Thank you for everything you took us from a bad Liverpool to this year incredible team I wish you good luck
Huge respect for Klopp, one of the best mangers of all time, I always admired him and him work, as a Real Madrid fan, we've had very good results against Klopp, but I really don't believe that we ever had a manger as good as Klopp. You will be from every football fan missed.
I knew this day would come but I didn't know it would be this hard. Thanks for everything!
he's coming to United!!!
Salah is next
Sad to hear, you will always be an excellent coach and a legend in our eyes. Greetins from France, Germany and the U.S. Jürgen Klopp, thank you for everything you've done and you mean a lot to us than some of our family members. Dam! This hurts!
Thank you Jurgen!
Done with pride and integrity..
This is hard man for real 😢 best manager we have had in so long
Mans gonna save Germany
We love u klopp and always will .
Who will be our new manager 😢😢😢
클롭감독님 수고 많으셨습니다 갑자기 떠나게 되어서 너무 슬프지만 항상 좋은일만 있길 바랍니다 처음 리버풀이라는 팀을 응원하게 되었고 축구를 너무 재밌게 보게 해주셔서 감사합니다
Sir Klopp💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😢😢🥹
Wow what a shitter
17:08 holly molly this hits hard - if this man doesn't get a statue right in front of Anfield i don't know who else ever should! Much respect legend!
Barely won much after spending so much over such a long period of time. Not that big a loss
We wish you the best wherever you go mate. Go and enjoy your normal life, you’ve earned it 👏👏👏 A truly brilliant and humble person
Roberto De Zerbi is the only manager who can replace Klopp's kind of football, which shifted from quick transitions to progressive possession futbol with Fabhino & Firminho at the helm & now to a mixture of both styles with MacLister at the pivot. Klopp was all about tempo & intensity & as an Arsenal fan, i feared them more than city. I have never seen a team whose base is transition become so adept at possession, especially when Van Dijk signed. (Real possession, not Unai Emery measured kind) De Zerbi has also shifted from heavy possession to an an interpid mixture of quick transition with possession fundamentals. Futhermore, De Zerbi, with his Italian pedagocal base, can improve players technically in the same way Klopp was able to marry the athletic and aesthetic. Not surprised to see Llana and Milner shift to Brighton. The only other manager i can see is Unai Emery. Xabi Alonso is not the guy because his brand of futbol has more of a La Liga sensibility and tempo.    The main issue with Klopp is that his futbol was perfect for the Anfield crowd, an almost perfect marriage and it will be difficult to find that tempo of futbol ever again. He's quite singular, an august manager who futbol i will miss.

VEM PRO BRASIL
I'm in tears too Best moments I've had as a Liverpool fan you do you klopp ynwa
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.
Respect to a legend... No matter where you go.... YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE
I’ve never been so sad about something in football. Klopp is no doubt an absolute legend. We all respect your decision to step away. Most importantly YNWA
He has this character of a leader or like ancient kings for who the soldiers would die for and Liverpool players has done the same for him. He is like old school coaches, doesn’t make football complicated like most of the coaches do nowadays, kept it simple but at the same time he ingested the emotions into the players which is most important for any player. I am an Arsenal fan but I think he is the best football manager in the world. I will place him over pep because he connects with the players so well and understands their emotions. Farewell Klopp. Wish you very best for your future
Nuff Respect Jürgen! BOOM!
Why man why ? Please don't
This will be a massive loss to football not just lfc. But we have to respect Klopp's decision and wish him well. He's been a true gift to our country's football and I am extremely sad to hear he's leaving. But the respect he shows to us as fans deserves our utmost respect right back. True football fans will miss you dearly and we thank you for your amazing contribution to lfc and football in general. ⚽❤
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
If you love him,let him go. Stevie G..love you too,pls stay where you are x
Who else is going to miss his smile 😢
He didn't just make Liverpool better, he made the Premier League better. An absolute legend. All the best Jurgen.
I don't get it. Why if he is not going elsewhere are both the Assistant Managers, Elite Development Coach and the Sporting Director leaving? 😢
Good luck to you were ever you go or diced to do even do am not the Liverpool fan it was great to see you in England.
Build this man a statue in front of anfield
I'm a city fan and I'm ☹ ☹  liverpool without jurgen is
i'm crying... we are very very sad to share this news... we hope you think again not to leave this club... My hero please don't leave us!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We knew this day would come. That doesn't make it any easier.
Take a good break Jurgen. Then come back and manage England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
As an Arsenal fan, i was completely gutted at the new of Klopp leaving end of the season. He set the premier league alight and took Liverpool to the level. If we do not win the league this season, I would be genuinely happy if Klopp does as the perfect ending to a unique manager.
Long live the king of the Kop! What a legend, Liverpool royalty 👑
I am really shocked , but you are courageous as you rebuilt young team for Alonso or  Bright en manager! If possible I prefer the former who knows the  clubs as  player as fan! Yet, we all loves Klopp for your  tactics with best play and technics with best display and your charisma at Anfield may not be repeated with other managers to come,  I wish you will raise at least three cups just like your services to  be mine and You may get two more premier league to be ta ken from the accused  Man City!
Barcelona next ?
april fouls came abit early init
If only more people were this genuine, transparent and truthful. Bravo Jurgen ❤
No no please no😢😢
as a man united fan, I always thought Klopp sucked. but Today I believe and am convinced that he sucks.
I get he is tired. But why, if he's not going somewhere else, are both the Assistant Managers, the Elite Development Coach and the Sporting Director all going as well?
Danke , für die Leidenschaft für die mega Highlights , die Titels und die Ehrlichkeit das Spiel mit der Presse 😂 ! LFC ❤ forever ! Danke❤ Kloppo
Ich bin Liverpool Fan aus Deutschland meine Söhne schenkten mir ein Eintrittskarte für ein Spiel in Karlsruhe..danke Jungs so konnte ich mein LFC mal sehen ❤❤❤❤
I’m gutted 😢 but happy for him! YNWA! Up the Reds!
Im a magpie fan but i dont think Jurgen needs to sit in the accused  box on this .
Come to United
Of all my favorite teams, this man is the greatest coach I’ve had the pleasure of following. Jürgen you will be missed. 😢
Thanks Sir Klopp . You restored our club to greatness . We will always appreciate you . We will miss you but we understand when you feel u are not able to give your best . Take all the rest you need and hopefully we will see u again .
thank you for everything Herr Klopp u gave me and millions of people joy, happiness, motivation and sense of touch will be grateful to you for everything forever Thanks!!!!!!!!
United fan here,Klopp,u the man !
😢😢😢😢
love respect adore
YNWA JURGEN❤️
As united fan thanks you klopp for bring more competition in league 😢 we will miss you gaffer
If you told me years ago, that I'd cry over a manager leaving a football club I'd call you crazy. I don't have words. Truly a legend of the club, and more than just a manager. "The Normal One" truly made us believers, and he'll forever hold a place in our hearts. YNWA
Next season will be tough, the nightmares of the era before Kloop are coming back.
Let's make Jürgen Klopp proud, as much as he has done it for us all the last years behind us💪🥳❤️ don't change the support against him, because he deserves good things coming back to him right now. Don't forget, also for him is it not an easy situation, but the right people feels his emotiones like me, listening the whole interview🥺❤️❤️
I’m crying he was the best
We love you Jurgen ❤ YNWA
Liverpool fan since 1974 ive never been so gutted as this ;just feels like you have lost a family member with Jurgen  But we are still in a chance of 4 trophies this season with him  He as  done so much for this club he will be talked about for so many years to come  YNWA JURGEN KLOPP
We couldn’t have asked for better than Klopp these past 9 years. What a gift this man has been to our club; what emotional thrills we got to share because of him. He’s earned his rest and then some; now come on, lads, and make it 2 under Klopp to send him off 🙌🏼
perhaps a woman can be manager and more diversity
Jurgen, THANK YOU❤
legend. Build a statue of the man
So honest A Liverpool LEGEND! We love you J
Liverpool is not Liverpool anymore 😢without Jürgen Klopp
😢can nit believe u r leaving liverpool is not going to be the same without u we love u klopp
Heartbreaking, but you've got to respect his decision. I hope we win all 4 trophies this season. It would be the most amazing send-off for the most amazing manager.
He certainly already has a contract with the DFB in his pocket and will be Julian Nagelsmann's successor as national coach in the summer.
what a legend!
I'm not a Liverpool fan but i will miss Klopp at Liverpool...
Guy is a legend: 7 years Mainz, 7 years Dortmund, 9 years Liverpool. 23 years and never even sacked. He always left on his own terms.
Thanks for everything Boss!!👏 True Legend ❤️ …. YNWA 😢👏
Huge respect to Klopp, nobody can leave in such transporent and humble way, YNWA Tears on my face....
Its obvious, same with Dortmund hes leaving to go manage another club abroad or Germany. You watch he will be managing another club within a year and half. Hes leaving us for another club.
I think that it had been Klopp’s original plan to leave after last season, but he changed his mind when he saw how it ended and decided to rebuild out squad. Whether or not the true, he is a legend, and he will never walk alone.❤  PS: To quote Pep, “We cannot replace him”
Thing is ... Jürgen will always be involved with Liverpool don't worry you cheesy wotsits
thank you for everything
Lo ha ganado todo en el Liverpool da tristeza pero todo un señor entrenador , la selección alemana lo espera para que le vuelvas a dar grandeza
This is absolutely devastating! Jurgen you made Liverpool great again, a force to be reckoned with once more, winners, so many memorable moments and trophies we’ve craved for years! You will be so missed, you are a legend! Hopefully this team you’ve built will push on and make you proud! Up the reds ❤❤😢😢
Good riddance
Why 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We love you Jurgen <3 Thank you! Lets make the last 4 months count!!!!!
Danke Kloppo für 9 wundervolle Jahre. Ihre Leidenschaft und Ehrlichkeit stimmen zu 100 Prozent. Du bist und bleibst eine Liverpool-Legende!  Thank you Kloppo for 9 wonderful years. Your passion and honesty are 100 percent. You are and always will be a Liverpool legend!
Klopp has become synonymous with Liverpool FC. It will be difficult to talk about Liverpool without mentioning Klopp. Thanks for putting  Liverpool back where it belongs. You will be cherished and remembered for ever.
OK, England, will you now come back into EU? We Germans gave you Kloppo, now you come back!!!! Pretty please?
Thank you! 🙏 ❤
We'll miss you Jurgen 🔴🔴🔴
Now Liverpool knows what it feels like to lose Klopp.😢 Heartfelt greetings from a Dortmund fan ❤
Im behind him no matter what happens. If the motto of the club means anything it's now so Jurgen you'll never walk alone my friend.
Don’t leave … pls if you need rest… you can rest and come back again😢
I am still stunned by this news - but waking up to this awful news this morning; I had to do a double take that it wasn't 1 April! However, thinking about this, tbh, at several of Jurgen's pre-match conferences this season, I've said quietly " Gosh he looks tired, drained - I do hope he is alright!" Because I do - all us LFC fans knew he would leave at some point; just please not now - well at the end of the season. Because we have so much promise in terms of what we can still achieve. I respect him too much to question his timing of this announcement - one of his best qualities is his honesty in my book. To delay things once his mind was made up so there could be leaks and speculation before an announcement - that would not have been who we respect - love even. I wish Jurgen and his family only the best in the future - he is an exceptional human being. Wherever and whenever I see him in the future - I believe I'll smile and know "Once he was OURS". All the very best Jurgen, thank you, thank you.
why Klopp don't leave Liverpool please stay the future is bright with you mate.
Sorry boss but that song is gonna be sung for 90 mins every week…you honestly don’t realise how much you mean to us
Full respect from an Arsenal fan…. What a Manager
GGGangsterrrr number one
Came to England a long time ago. For some reason, I fell in love with the club as soon as I started watching the EPL. Fell in love with the players but mostly with Jürgen because of how passionate and talented he is and the chemistry he has with the squad. The moment he won us the Champions League I had tears in my eyes and I have tears once again but this time for a sad reason. Thank you coach for everything you did for us and I wish you all the best in your career, on and outside of the pitch. YNWA ❤
What a man. Saved our club from the abyss. Won our dream, turned us into believers once again. YNWA, thank you Jürgen! YNWA ❤
I think Klopp act really like a father would do for his child. He brought every club back on the track. First with Mainz who was in the second league and he missed the third place to rise to the first league three times in a row and then he did it. Dortmund was financiell broken and he earned two times the mastership with almost no names players. He gave Liverpool the first championship in the PL after 30 years. His legacy was always a solid foundation for the next person in charge. So, don't be sad for too long LFC Fans. Just enjoy he was part of your history.
😢
It’s my late Father’s birthday today. And I always find today tough. But Jurgen’s announcement today, I won’t lie, has been an absolute body blow. You made us believers again. I’m really going to miss you boss. YNWA
It reminds me the Kenny Dangliesh resignation a little bit. The reasons sound so similar as back then. Obviously, managing a club like Liverpool is a highly demanding job! So I don't like it as a Liverpool fan, but I fully understand it. Thank You Jurgen Klopp, for resurrecting us, we will be forever grateful. You've written History with us and, as the song goes, YNWA. Wish you all the best.😊🙌🙏❤🍺
The time when I started following football consistently was in 2017-18. From that season on, Liverpool was the team that I resonated with the most, a major part in that was Klopp.  For me, Klopp and Liverpool are synonymous with each other, I can't think of one without the other.
Let's not act like anyone died. With all the tragedy going on in the world, let's not overblow this.  Great managers and players  have left Liverpool before and the show must go on...
I cry too, such a character in the football world💎, happy to see him soon as manager of 1.FC Union Berlin
🤣 he’s basically saying he’ll manage again but f Liverpool. Aye
From a united fan 👏👏 (can’t lie I’m a bit happy though)
I am Portuguese but my second team always been Liverpool ❤
To say that I’m heartbroken is an understatement 😢  Kloppo YNWA ❤
ITFC fan here, sitting here watching this with a tear in my eye. What a man, what a manager, what a human being. And actually, what a club LFC is.
Ich denke da steckt was anderes dahinter… und wünsche dir nur das beste

Pep Lijnders for manager

Anyway 😄 we still have till the end of this season & we could win everything with him 👊🏽👊🏽😃 what a send off that would be 😀😀 so, let’s get behind the lads & win everything.   YNWA Jurgen ❤❤❤
As an arsenal fan watching this, i cant deny that jurgen is a good few levels above arteta. Sad news to see such a charismatic man leave the league.

Very sad. I hope he enjoys a year off and then coaches our German national team. Please!!!

You got it, Boss.
I can't stop crying 😭😭😭 please stay klopp
La primera vez que ví a Liverpool fue aquella temporada de la remontada en champions vs Milan y me hice fan, me tocó verlo en las malas, después el regreso poco a poco a competencias europeas y verlo regresar a la elite del fútbol de la mano de Klopp... gracias por todo mister.
It shocked me to be honest. But I really greatful to Jurgen for such many perfect years ❤️ Thank you for everything, Jurgen!!!
A True Gentleman. Legend. ❤ (from a West Brom fan)
Painful that our coach is leaving us. 😭 😭 😭
Nice one Jurgen, like a lot of people are saying, you are truly once in a lifetime manager. The privilege was ours.
I'm gutted, but will totalling respect his decisions. #1 BOSS A certified LEGEND  ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why on earth would you announce this now? My God we are chasing 4 trophies !!!

Thank you for everything
From doubters to believers. You delivered on that. Thank you for everything. YNWA
The colour of his legs is a bit disconserning in his interview he seems like he's hiding something by his mannerisms..I hope I'm wrong
Thank you Sir Klopp, totally understand your decision being in a high pressure job myself, in your own words it is important how you are remembered when you leave, we have priceless memories and I wish you nothing but the best for you and your family…..salute, you will never be forgotten YNWA
With all due respect to the genius that is our legend Klopp. I believe there may be an underlying reason for his departure!. He is yet another giant legend of our beloved Liverpool, who created a new golden era and brought us unforgettable moments of happiness. We will always cherish these memories and be proud to have experienced them together. .......   Y N WA 🌹❤🎩
Thank you for everything you've done, I hope you enjoy yourself.  Liverpool fans will always be grateful for what you did, you are a true legend, on and off the field.
Jurgen The Normal one, this is worse than my worse break up 💔 😫 😢 how am i supposed to live
One of the greatest coach in Liverpool history!!! Thank you for all you did for us.. you will never walk alone !!
I use you as my manager in my club in ea fc mr klopp. As soon as I saw the passion you have as a manager I knew you were the one. Goodbye legend 🙏🏽
Not only top coach but great man ,he come to Liverpool 8 years ago , transformed the team ,won the trophies and won the hearts of the people and going to leave legacy forever as one of the best coaches in football . You can tell he love the club and love football but yes there is a life outside if the football . Top bloke !
take the L
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo😮
"It is not important what people think when you come in, it is important what they think when you leave"  And the result is that you will be loved forever - YNWA ❤
How many coaches are admired by supporters of 3(!) clubs (Mainz 05, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool FC)? Only one, the normal one 🙂
😂 normally I'm gracious with stuff like this because it's the right thing to do but reading that the bin men are crying! 😂😂 Wish klopp all the best and all but I'm pissing myself laughing at LiVARpool 😂
i don't know what to say 😢
next, maybe holidays in switzerland 🎿☀🍺 👏👏👏😀
True Legend. At Mainz, at Dortmund and Liverpool.  I Hope He will Finish   as Champion .   Jürgen, wir lieben dich. Gönn dir ein freies Jahr, aber bitte geh nicht zu den bayern
I hope he returns to football after the rest he needs
The fans will not release you Jurgen Klopp. Your notice of leave is too short. You still have 10 more years left on the minds of the fans. At least 6 more years. Jurgen Jurgen Jurgen Klopp, please don't go. YNWA.
je suis triste
Scousers in tears hahahaha. 1 covid prem title and one CL in 9 years.. terrible manager hahaha
I'm a Celtic and utd man , and this guy is an absolute fucking legend hands down. Will definitely miss him and his brilliant personality.
Even as a rival fan the prem will miss you Klopp😢
Come to REAL MADRID!❤
Thanks for everything! ❤
Thanks for everything you have done for Dortmund and Liverpool  You bought these clubs back to glory and never ever gave up in difficult times You'll be missed Jurgen
Jurgen Klopp deserves all the praise he gets. What hes done with LFC is absolutely amazing. Incredible style of football, trophies, personality, what he did with the likes of Salah, Mane, Robertson to name a few is stunning. He won everything, he was unlucky not to win more. A class act, Liverpool have been very lucky to have him these last 9 years. A hard act to follow but, he's leaving behind a better club than he inherited.
What a guy!! Love from Manutd❤
I think we are looking at the next Germany manager. That being said, I'd rather he managed England.
inb4 its a scandal
One  of the best manager at all time!I wishing you all the best Mr Klopp!👏💪
Jurgen is the heart and soul of the club. He has been the perfect fit for the club and the fans. My body reacted to the news as if there had been a bereavement in my family, devastated. But no one, having heard his explanation today, could possibly complain about his reasons for going this summer. A wonderful person and football  manager. Thank you, and best wishes, Jurgen.
This hurts so much. You will be missed Jurgen YNWA
As fan of F.C. Porto and 1 F.C. Kaiserslautern,  i have to say. I admire your work and you will be missed. Thank you Herr Klopp.
You watch the lads run through brick walls for Kloppo for the rest of the season. Grab onto something, this could be a hell of a ride!
Nah,,,, still can't write anything meaningful enough. My heads still spinning. I'll try again later
THANK YOU JURGEN, YOU DESERVE A REST MAN, ALL THE VERY BEST TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. WE OWE YOU THAT, YOU GAVE 100% TO US AND WE WILL ALWAYS SING YOUR NAME SIR.
Oh my God... Thank you for everything, Jurgen! You are a truly inspirational person. Although I never met you in person, I love everything about you. Good luck in everything you'll do from now on! YNWA!
Best ever to do it for Liverpool
If there was any doubt as to whether or   not Liverpool would win the league, now there's no question they'll win it for him.
I really love everything he did, thanks Klopp!
I followed Liverpool because of Klopp. You won't walk alone, dear manager.
It is like a family member leaving you. We are going to miss everything about Jurgen, his lively energetic presence & not just as the manager but he is absolutely gem of a human being. Let's back the team and the manager & end the season on a high. YNWA. ❤
I respect you a lot. Thank you Boss!!! YNWA!!! ❤
Pure Legend and looking forward to the rest of the season, danke für alles Jürgen und viel Erfolg für die restliche Saison ❤🙏
When you leave their losses of gap without you Klopp no other better coach can maintain these team 😅😅😢😢😂😂
I still can't believe it. An era has come to an end. There's simply no man that could replace Jurgen and his influence towards club. We will miss you Boss, YNWA!
Noooooooo
No. Just . . . just . . . no.
One of the great Managers, great passion and care for his club and a genuine person who doesn’t suffer fools.❤
Not a Liverpool fan (saints fan lol) but this guy has been a different level. Brilliant on and off the pitch and is a complete role model of how passion and modesty can work together. Top bloke and hope he gets his well deserved rest. Feeling for you scousers today. Confidently say one of the best ever.
He is one of a kind really. Sad day for every Liverpool fan, but we must understand his descision. Time has come for him to enjoy his life after blessing us with so many great memories. We well miss you, Jurgen, be sure will do. YNWA !!!
Love this man so much,gave me the best years of my life! What a man!!! 😢
Wonderful manager, wonderful man. Just so grateful to have had him as our manager, he has always had total integrity and even in this and been brilliant from the get go. My sincerest thanks for everything and every day you have and will give LFC. YNWA Jurgen.
It just shows ya how much mental strength Sir Alex had to go on as long as he did. Can't be easy managing in PL.. good luck Klopp from a Man Utd fan.
Bundestrainer wird er
Mark my words. He's going to bayern Munich or the national team of Germany!
Love him !!  And Grateful for what he did !!   He’s 6 months older than me and if I had his money …. I’d enjoy life … he’s done more than most and let’s hope he revisits frequently
much love
God bless you boss absolutely gutted rival fans celebrating your departure tells us all we need to know. Sigh please help us get the right next guy.
Jürgen, thank you for everything that you’ve build in LFC and your extremely strong passion for the team, the club, the fans and the city. You’ll forever be monumental and certainly YNWA! 🙏❤️⚽️🏆
God bless you! All the best in everything, Jurgen!
Fulham fan here. Quality interview. Quality man. Quality manager. You will miss him.
You came you Conquered you took pool into a new era post Dalglish keegan ironman smith fair clough Gerrard etc etc etc....Thanks for your Energy and your team of coaches you are amazing ...your premiership title your champions league winners YOU ARE THE MODERN SHANKLY
Actually he is different
Like the Men in Blazers suggested I would really want a statue of Jurgen at Anfield in an air hug where you can go in for a hug with him. Would mean so much to us. Thank you for all the wonderful times and memories.
I am an arsenal fan but i am so gutted to see him go  One of the best characters in football 😢
What a guy….i am not even a Liverpool fan and i would walk through a wall for Klopp after listening to that. This Liverpool team will be very difficult to beat for the rest of the season
Take a year off jurgen and enjoy it. Think he will manage germany after his year break and he completely deserves it. Unbelievable memories absolute legend. Deserves a stand naming after him or a statue. Heart breaking but no manager or player or anyone for that matter is bigger than the club. I dont think xabi should be next maybe in a few years but he needs more time to prove himself. Simeone is my personal pick but i know a lot will disagree.
صدمه رحيل كلوب 😢 وانا عن نفسي سارحل مع كلوب حيثو يرحل
Thank you Klopp. I'm sure he will end up coaching Germany.
Get a massive  million pound.  Pay out.  !   Bye Bye.  ! Liverpool  !   Don't care !
as a Real Madrid fan, this is sad, he will forever be remembered at Liverpool as one of the greatest managers to manage that club, and in the premier league. He ended Liverpool's premier league title drought.
Devestated 😢 My idol and the greatest leader I've ever seen
Notts Forest supporter here , just wishing mr Klopp all the best in the future and you will be missed in the premier league . And I wish all you Pool supporters the very best . Take care .
Dont go klopp .. 😢
You’ll be missed jurgen
why some one cutting onions here
Going to German National team win the World Cup again 🎉
That's my coach. I have supported many managers in this great club since my teen but Klopp is special, see the passion and energy you have brought, relationship and having future of the club at heart. Beyond football, in Klopp i see a role model professionally and personally.  Sometimes in life, we need to take some decisions.  We respect your decision and wish you more success in future endeavour as You will Never Walk Alone.  YNWA From Nigeria
Please don't go😢😢😢
Thanks for everything you have done for our club Jürgen , you will be missed greatly ❤ YNWA 😢
Er wird Bundestrainer.. nach der EM … wurde auch Zeit, Jürgen. Das ganze Land hat dich aufgefordert.
This is so hard to accept! 🥺🥺 Thank you Jürgen! 🥺❤️
Respekt für Deine Entscheidung! Nimm Dir die Zeit und tank so viel Energie wie möglich. Die Fußballwelt wird Dich vermissen, weiß aber auch, dass Du ohne Fußball nicht leben kannst. Also: bis bald 👋🏻 😢
The best manager we’ve had in my lifetime. You’re a true hero jurgen, Thankyou for everything!  Let’s go and win these last few trophies this year then! YNWA 🔴🔴🔴
Thank you for everything Jurgen. Thank you so much. Theres is a huge sadness over Merseyside today.
Gutted
Think twice about this klopp 😢😢😢😢
Der allerbeste Trainer
end of an era
As a supporter, I respect your decision, but of course you will leave deep memories for us. by hearing your explanation, I think that for 8 seasons you worked very hard behind the scenes, all your thoughts and energy put in 100% for the team, many people don't know that. I also came to understand how harsh the EPL is that it seems to take away someone's "life". We supporters thank you all for your loyalty to the club and all the achievements you have brought. thank you boss! Enjoy the end of your season then enjoy your rest period. YNWA
Thank you for everything you’ve done for English football. YNWA
Thank you Kloppo ❤ You changed me from a doubter to a believer, not just as a fan of the club but in life. We appreciate you and your energy and we will make this season another to remember. For the city, for the team, and for you.
This feels tougher than a break up.
Germany shall pick him up as manager in two years
Thank you for your honesty and compassion you have for your team and the people...your a true legend and will never be forgotten..we are grateful for what you have done for the team...YNWA ❤❤ Look after yourself klopp❤❤
Top man from a Sheffield United fan
Thank you, Jürgen❤ I didn't expect this at all and I'm incredibly sad, but he goes as a legend. I hope Liverpool wins everything possible this season
As a Man United supporter, I say, hats off to you Jürgen. He's taken Liverpool so far, and given everything and more. Will be a great miss from the premier League. All the best Jürgen.👍
Thank you alot Klopp.
You have been the reason why so many of us have been joyful over the years. We appreciate you, love you and you derserve nothing from us except gratitude from all @YNWA fans❤❤🎉🎉❤❤
Liverpool ❤
💔
What can we say, but thank you ❤
There’s definitely something that is fuelling this decision. Time will tell.
Love you Best coach
Im no Liverpool fan but this guy is a special character.....hes an example to follow on ethics in work bussines and life.....i dont care about the team but i dont know why but i feel sad he leaves....i honestly hope he doesnt have health problems.... respect!!!! respect!!!!respect!!! Thats all i have to say!!!if i were a player he would be the man id want to play for
I was so happy when Jurgen became became our manager but then I have questioned Jurgen’s choices in the past, mainly about transfers. It turned out he knew what he was talking about and I was an idiot. Then I heard him talking about life and agreed with everything he said. I am devastated that he will no longer be our manager but I trust his choice as being correct. I hope that he is fully with us after he stops being our manager. He is a worthy person and I hope that he is with us as worthy people. I believe in his team, this team, and I look forward to the Liverpool Football Club he has gifted to us. Thank you to Jurgen and his family for putting up with the stress that we put on you. God Bless and Thank You very much.
illl miss u klopp. ❤ thank you for everything you have done for us ❤️❤️❤️💜
❤❤❤❤
Clubs choice...Mourinho or Gerrard ..❤❤plz think with urs HEAD not HEART😢😢❤❤❤
Life is over as we know it  You owe us nothing  We owe you everything   Danke Jurgen, YNWA
I’m lost for words, I’m absolutely gutted. I feel sick to the stomach, him and shankly are greatest motivators. I’m gonna miss him so much 😢
❤ WHAT A LAD!!! ❤️  He will NEVER be forgotten!  Klopp, we will miss you! 💔💔💔😔
Even this video says so much about him.he is just brilliant
😢😢😢
Klopp is also quitting YouTube 😢😢😢
You will never ever be forgotten Jurgen. The heights you brought our club to, the moments you helped create and the football you coached our team play was all absolutely unbelievable. As sad as I am that you are leaving, I'm grateful to have been alive to witness the Klopp era of Liverpool Football Club. It will undoubtedly go down as one of if not the greatest in the clubs history for centuries to come. Take care of yourself, YNWA🔥❤️
From a City fan.... Love this guy , absolutely awesome manager 🎉 but it's his decision we must respect. (Happy 😅 from inside , hope it will do good to City later seasons 🤔)
😢😢😢
As an Arsenal fan, I have huge respect for Klopp. Thanks for all the memories, both for your team and those against us. Top top bloke, someone to have a drink and a banter with 👏
He’s trying to enjoy his life with his loved ones before he gets older. He has the money now he wants the time. Understandable. Hell of a coach hope he returns one day.
thank you coach...Huge respect for you. You are not be forgotten. Keep safe always. Health is wealth...YNWA...
😭😭😭

Sadly this is an eye opener for the unsung hero in the eyes of liverpool fans in South Africa of SIR ALEX FURGESON...FERGIE DID THE SAME TO UNITED FOR NOT WINNING THE LEAGUE IN LIKE 26 YEARS ..HE CAME ON BOARD SHRUGGED OF THE CRITISM AND IMAGINED CONTINUE WUD WAT HE DID FOR UNITED SAME AGE BACK THEN AS KLOPP AND EVEN CONTUNUED FOR LIKE ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS AFTER KLOPPS DURATION...😢😢😢NOW PEOPLE OR LIVERPOOL FANS WILL KNOW AND MORE ESP ADMIT THE ONE OF A KIND ...SIR KING...ALEX  FERGUSON 😢😢😂😂😂❤❤❤😂😂😂

YNWA. WE LOVE YOU ❤❤❤❤

Alles Gute für die Zukunft Jürgen. Genieße das Leben und tue dir niemals die Bayern oder die Nationalmanschaft an. Das hast du nicht nötig...
I'm literally crying. thank you for everything Klopp❤❤❤❤ YWNWA
They started growing onions at Anfield 😢 It's time to harvest.
Thanks sir for everything I started to watch football when i once accidentally saw   uwa interview at Dortmund Then miracle happened and u (sir) joined liverpool N rest is legacy ❤❤ thanks for everything   ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why, Klopp, will you leave the club? When I heard the news, I started to see you again coaching this team, which is everything to me. Thank you for crying, but I wish you good luck in your life, and I hope I will see you again, I love, coaching this team, which is my life, and I hope
i wonder where he's gonna live at
Hoffentlich als nächstes beim dfb aufräumen !❤  Aber von Grund auf !

💔💔
Build him a statue!!! He made Liverpool elite again. Thank you so much
Vay jurgen  ju ar a legend😢😢❤
Next england manager, imagine the 3 lions playing heavy metal football 🎉🎉🎉
안돼..
This day was always coming, trust me lads, if it's Klopp making the decision I stand by it. He's never done wrong by us, and if he thinks his time at Liverpool should come to an end, then I do too. YNWA, Jurgen will always have a special place in our hearts.
If yu decided to go no problm yu gonna we ar Liverpool 😢😢😢
Bro💔
Hopefully he wins the league to close this chapter in a special way
@ 6:51 the interview shows his love
The Supporters will give all our Energy Jurgen ! You have done so much and now its up to us to get you , liverpool FC and us supporters over the line. In Klopp we trust and now its upto us for the boss to trust us !
Klopp to Barcelona. Here We Go!!!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you so much, Jurgen for everything that you have done for this club. You'll be missed❤
Did anyone else get goosebumps? Absolute legend. Will miss him so much 😢
Time really flies! Still feels like his Dortmund years was just a few years back but it'll be 9 years by the end of this season that he's managed Liverpool😮
We'll never forget him.
Liveepool would join united and chelsea as a mid table club in no time 🤣🤣
It's going downhill from next season. Love to see it. GGMU.
😭😭😭
This morning I got back from school my dad said you know you were a Liverpool supporter since 2015 the year I was born my father said I have bad news I said what he said Liverpools manager left until the end of the season I was like at least I will meat him on May since that day I was crying 😢plz like never give up
Words don't justice what this man has done for the football club. I am absolutely gutted like I'm sure all LFC fans are. We must enjoy the remaining time we have with him as manager. Thank you, Jürgen. YNWA.
So ein peinlicher "Wirbel" um  diesen Herrn. "Dauergrinsend und maßlos "überschätzt.  Was  er fast perfekt beherrscht,  seine Person nach  außen positiv  "zu verkaufen". Ein Zeichen unserer so kranken Mediengesellschaft.
LEGEND
Rivalry aside , a great manager who has made Liverpool relevant again. Glad he’s going
Thats my manager right there <3
Nothing but love for you and this decision, as much as it hurts. It is only so painful because of all the joy you've brought us, Jurgen. Such is life, joy cannot exist without pain in our mortal world.
He will get Arteta to fight him on the sidelines
Greatest ever Manager of Liverpool. Man, I'm crying. I love this man and this club, we all do it ❤❤❤.
No gonna lie im writing this with stinging eyes i always knew this day had to come but jeez this is tough to take. Im devastated because jurgen is a truly special manager and im sure a lovely person.
Liverpool must sign Eric Ten Hag or Mikel Arteta
Thank you for everything and hopefully we win a lot of stuff in you memories
We will miss you
What a profound impact and effect he has had on Liverpool squad and the fan base. Surely, Klopp will be missed and the moments, mentality monsters and remarkable things that he did on and off the field. He surely has take the team through lips and bounds. He has done a lot of things to get Liverpool squad to where it belong. Major props and shout to Klopp for sure and his style will be missed and cherised. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥

Ten Hag did predict it but I highly doubt this is how he thought the Era would come to an end. lol He's lucky to be around to see it as well.
Bye 👋🏾
Wao. This came as a shock to me..I Will miss him…as an arsenal fan
No, this is not possible, i don't want to belive it. I am from Romania and a fan of Liverpool😢
"I am not the right one for the future" 😂 you are right, Klopp. I wish you don't mind to be back to Liverpool again someday while Van Big Dik has left. Van Big Dik must be kicked out immediately.
Heartbroken. We'll miss the hell out of this legend! Thank you for being an absolutely CLASS ACT for your almost decade at LFC. So many amazing moments.
What a guy, what a legend thank youuu for everything bossss 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
😢😢mike fox I feel the same as you from South africa
Was really hoping my first ever Liverpool game you’d be in the dugout doing what klopp does best hopefully I can still have the chance to do so all the best in your carrier. LEGEND, you done the impossible for Liverpool lotta love ❤️‍🔥
I don't know what to say. Don't have anything to describe about him. I am literally crying with 1000 memories with him😢. Don't know how to thank him. I only wish he could stay more years. I mean it's hurting me deep😓
😪😪😪 YNWA
HEIL HANSA! ❤
Thank you Jesus for blessing our club with this amazing coach called Jurgen
lets just leave him alone and let him live a life as a normal person.😂😢
L E G E N D
As a city fan this is just sad to see an era has come to an end. Always expected pep to retire first before klopp.
Thanks for everything Jurgen. The amount of happiness you've given us over the years has been immense! I hope we can a lot of trophies this year and give you the farewell that you deserve!! ❤❣😃
my whole city peoples are crying when they listen this
There are new kids on the block. Alonso, Arteta, Areola... Pep and Klop's days are ending.
What happend?
Huge pressure gonna be on all facets of liverpool ..cos if by end of this Premier League Season they dont atleast equal man uniteds league trophies ..it can take God knows how long only if they will ever get their dream and desire over man United in decades centuries or generations to come...😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂
As a Dortmundfan I could only understand what Mainz supporters felt after he left us. And I think Liverpool supporters only truly understand the full scale of the greatness that is Klopp in 2-3 years. I wished this day would never come for you guys, so enjoy the moments and let's hope he finishes with another Trophie for Liverpool!
If you respect Klopp you have to respect his decision. He will be sadly missed but he has made many great memories for the fans. A Liverpool legend forever but more importantly a great human being. Good luck for the future Jurgen and also good luck to Liverpool for the rest of the season. Thanks for everything from a Spurs fan.
Legend off anfield sir klopp
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m A Man Utd Fan But IDC He Is An Amazing Manager And Will Be Missed
I am dead inside.
I see the storm clouds are coming, I will miss that golden sky....  It was beautiful.
Dortmund wartet auf dich
Klopp’s just having a Shirley Valentine eat pray love moment ... don't worry lads he's not aware that it's just a temporary transient thing he’ll come to his senses soon enuff  ... perhaps when he receives ze call from Bayern or ze Deutsche mannschaft …
This is a classy way to go out. Well done Klopp.
Job done
Thank you for everything you have do for liverpool your the best manager coach and friend to everyone who support the team i watch every game to see you and the players  🇹🇹👊🏾❤
Am still crying about this I don't know what to say.....but I think the team will continue to do the best
Stunned, saddened, appreciative, thankful, but ultimately happy for the Boss if this is what he wants. YNWA Jurgen.
God this is emotional. Completely heartbroken, didn't think this day would come for another 2 years at least. But he's going out on his own terms with his own reasons, can only respect his honesty. Can only hope once he takes a rest for a couple of years he might return to the club recharged but that's optimistic thinking. He'll leave Liverpool comfortably on the club's Mount Rushmore along with Shankly, Paisley and Dalglish. He'll never be forgotten for everything he's done for the club and for the fans. A quadruple would be a lovely signing off for him. ❤
I was respect Juergen. But now is different while he always put Van Big Dik on line up since last season. Then when he pointed Van Big Dik as a captain, everything is over. Timr for you to leave. Take the cinderella van big dik with you.
I'm Gonna Miss this man Soooo Much. He is the Best we have Ever had (in my eyes) Certainly the best I've seen and I have seen Houllier, Rafa and Dalglish and Klopp is the BEST. I'm Gutted that he is Leaving, But I wish him all the best on Everything he does and I hope he can win a few more trophies before he leave. He certainly deserves more and defo another Premier League. Thank You Soooooo Much for what you have given my Beautiful club. YNWA x
Jesus this is devastating. Thank you Jurgen.
Hit me as powerfully as when Dalglish left after his first stint at Liverpool FC
💔😢
In my personal opinion, I think the reason behind his decision to leave Liverpool is due to his ambition to manage Germany.
Thank you for your service, Boss ❤.  You will never walk alone
Wow, just wow...I'm not a Liverpool fan (although I often wish I had chosen them as my English team), but I am a huge Klopp fan and I thought that this was a marriage made in heaven, a perfect fit...I still think so, actually...  This is such a Klopp thing to do, pure integrity...a humble man who loves the game, clearly loves Liverpool...doing what he thinks is best for the club and himself...truly a class act...I really hope that most will respect his decision and the timing of this announcement and try to make the remainder of the season as brilliant as possible...that would be the proper way to part ways...  I have to admit that this does make me very sad....I love watching his teams play, especially his Liverpool teams...but, at the same time I am happy for him as he is doing it his way and is clearly getting on with his life as he chooses to....Good on him!  It's strange, while I do support another club I now want Liverpool to win everything they can this year as a fitting tribute to such a great manager and human being...that would be true poetry in a world that increasingly seems to lack grace.  Klopp knows that he will never walk alone.  (edit:  The EPL will never be quite the same again...a real loss for all who love the beautiful game and the best league in it)
My heart says please stay Klopp..❤ But yeah you made the decision 😢
Laws of nature not karma ...😢😢😢theres no body..no group...no party that's indispensable...for us a South Africa..all it took was a small nudge that knocked poor President Thambo Bheki 😢😢😢Literally overnyt out his HOTSEAT..😢😢😢❤❤❤
Legend 😭
He seems to be suffering from insomnia. He shows the features on his face and his repeated talk about out of energy confirms it.
I hope one day he will come back home to BVB.  Sad news for all Liverpool fans.. YNWA 💛🖤❤🤍
amazing man, from a Partick Thistle supporter.
we love you Klopp, to everything you do
and that children is how the premier league became a farmers league.
😢😢😢😢😢😢
Open honest and total respect for you. Good luck for your future you are an incredible human.
Don’t leave I love you in the team please don’t leave I will miss you
What a marvelous man and skilled coach Jurgen has been.  From his relationships with his "boys" to his lawn bowling with seniors this man has arguably done more for Liverpool FC and Premier League football than any manager in modern history.
One of the saddest day in my life😢, thanks for everything. You will never walk alone
Yes, you are getting old, Juergen. So as Van Bik Dik. Even I wish Van Bik Dik leave as soon as possible, if Juergen wanna leave that's OK. Take Van Bik Dik with you!
👑❤
👑
The Jürgen Klopp stand
Life is short.  Soon many of us will realize it
“I’m still a normal guy but I don’t have a normal life and I don’t want to wait until I’m too old to live a normal life”   What a respectable and insightful decision at the highest level of sport. Leaving with grace, and mental health in tact. What a legend!
All I can say which isn't enough, I'd prefer to hug him, but , thankyou. Totally embodies liverpool fc. I would love us to win the league, we must fully fight to win this league and have a proper farewell parade.
Thanks Klopp ☹❤ Btw im crying
A typically German decision! Pope Benedict did the same number on us Catholics ten years ago. 😇
😢😢
Diese Entscheidung so vorausplanent zu treffen,ist größer als jeder Titel 👍 ❤️💛❤️ for me, you are absolutely the spezial one 👍 genieße alles was jetzt kommt und alles gute in deiner Zukunft 💪
I will always love you for the memories. I have multiple disabilities and the team you built have given me such a great distraction from it. You created a buzz around the club that was/is infectious and have given guided us to such heights that I wouldn't have ever dreamt of. Thank you, once a red always a red ❤  YNWA, always with you boss!
We will miss klopp big time he is a legend
Not even a Liverpool fan but this sucks, really liked Klopp, and this was so random today
OMG, he looks fatigued. Let him go and rest. YNWA
Wen u like celtic ur meant to like liverpool too..n a do but this guy made me love them..gonna miss his smiley general demenour..humour n grit..he'l certainly never walk alone again
Boss you have made a decision, it must be right as you have proved it so many times before. You have looked after us for many years, It is time for you to look after yourself. Thank you for everything. I hope your future is as successful as it has been in the past. Again thank you. Still never been sacked.
Big shock, not only for Liverpool. Take care of yourself Jürgen. Lass dich blos nicht zur Nationalmannschaft überreden ;)
I am an Arsenal fan and I am heartbroken, I loved Klopp when he was at Dortmund. When he left Dortmund, I was begging Wenger to leave so we could get him. But Liverpool got him first and I knew they would go on to win things. The Premier League will lose a quality manager and character.
U set a standard that is 2nd to none. We will miss u. May God b with u. Ure the man. Go well when it's time to go.
Why announce it now, wait till the season is over, will probably upset the team for the rest of the season
Thank you, Klopp. YNWA
MY MANAGER FOR LIFE, THANK YOU JURGEN FOR EVERYTHING <3
A German had to save the English club ❤
so so beautiful Klopp, I understand you 100 procent. Thank you so so much Klopp for everything. With kind regards Torben Gram, Denmark
We love you Kloppo; I hope he gets honored with a statue. Greatest Liverpool coach of my lifetime.
Thanks for everything. Can't believe that day has been decided. We'll miss you.
Why gaffer 🥺💔
😭😭😭
Thank you for everything Jürgen! I will never forget everything you have done for the club, and wish you nothing but the best in whatever your next chapter is. Today is a sad day but there is still work to be done to make this a special season! YNWA
Job done
The best manger in world
All the best, Herr Klopp- a role model for all a....h.....s of the world to reflect on. Danke.
Job done
Very perfect time I agree we need New method of fighting against man City. We know there will be time of struggle but we can't wait for changes. Thanks for uar Time.
As a United fan I support Klopp but not Liverpool
As a man utd fan i am very happy Liverpool are screwed now
Am shocked, but still appreciate and respect JK decision. JK in me forever ❤
So sad.i hope Liv with 4 Cup in This Season !
People like JP are few and far between, especially in football. Passion and honesty to himself and the club and the fans. Not resting in the glory of the  past but always thinking about tomorrow. The best memories are ahead. JP will never ever walk alone. TAHANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU❤❤❤
Job done
Klopp is a legend ❤
Can't imagine Liverpool FC without klopp.....😢😢😢😢
He truly is a rare gem of human beings. A person who is gifted with so much talent and success in life, yet he is not greedily drown by it and able to stay as a human being who recognize himself fully, his floor and his ceiling.
We all know that no one person is bigger than the club, but in the 40 years I've supported Liverpool, it's hard to realise that right now !
I'm a Chelsea fan and I wish we had a coach like Klopp. You're a legend of the game.
only rdz is gutsy and passionate like kloop .hope they get him ....good luck jurgeen kloop
Oh no this is a disaster
Sin duda uno de los mejores entrenadores, Klopp se merece una despedida a lo grande, un señor que llevo a la cima al Liverpool ❤
Dont worry guys, Xabi Alonso will be the best replacement ;) Klopp is a Legend
Jurgen klopp the family of Liverpool club
Just like at Dortmund.. the end of rebuilding has always been himself....😢😢
I’ve been fortunate to witness the four greatest managers in history to manage this club. Klopp, for me is the second greatest manager in the history of Liverpool fc. Paisley, being the first. Thanks for the great memories, Juergen. Best wishes, to you and your family..
Overrated
the club has made his job  difficult because of transfers the owner is very stingy,
WILLKOMMEN ZÜRUCK 🎉❤ NATIONAL MANNSCHAFT TRAINER ✊🏽
Bitte Bitte werde nicht national trainer der  Deutschen MAnschaft!!!
I will forever miss you jurgen❤
He will get england job
Thank you Jurgen Klopp for turning doubters to believers
Thank you klopp.... I am from nagaland ... a million miles away from where you are... u will never even know where it is...but all I have to say is... u gave me joy and u gave me hope .... u are a great. Thank your for every thing
he must be coming to Fulham!
****** is dead
The timing of this could be a masterstroke - Klopp rolling the dice and daring Pep to play for the highest stakes. He's just got his team to a cup final and they're top of the league; Anfield will be an absolute bear pit from here on in and the players will find an extra ten or even fifteen percent to play up for their manager. This makes an already fascinating title run in even more explosive. Game on!
Good bye Jurden Klopp you should come to man united
I became a fan of Liverpool around the beginning of 90s. So I havent known about the glory of the past. Been used to an "upper mediocre" team for so long until Klopp came and made me BELIEVE that we are actually champion material. YNWA
We will miss you!!! Loved watching your games, you on the pitch, in interviews and everywhere else. Best Manager for me and true legend. Thank you for putting Liverpool back on the map and building the most formidable team in the world that played so many grueling seasons and finals. You always gave it your all and wishing you all the best in enjoying a well deserved break!
Amazing news! Feels like a brand new signing!
Nahhh.....even though I'm not a fan of the club, i still have huge respect and admiration for Jurgen... sad to hear he's leaving
I sense a truly special person. Continued success in whatever your next chapter is.
Now I wish even more that Liverpool win the title this year. It would be just.... Incredible!
The fan reaction he will get, will be immense
Pure class. From a Cfc fan.
Thank you Klopp for everything. For everything that you make Liverpool achieve in the past few years. Thank you Jurgen Klopp
Forever will be a legend Jurgen
I really never comment anything on social media, but today I have to. I started watching Liverpool in 2015 because of this man and just fell in love with this amazing club. I can not describe the pain in my heart, hearing he’s gonna leave…but I have full understanding for his decision. Thank you for everything Jürgen! ❤
Didn’t think i’d be shedding tears today, over football of all things. This man, no this absolute legend. Yeah, it’d be insane getting Mourinho or Zidane, but nah, I’d still take Klopp over all of them. The way he managed Liverpool the past what, 5-6 years? Has been exactly what Liverpool needed to make it to the top. It’s felt like such a short amount of time..Before Klopp, Steven Gerard was the best thing to of ever happened to The reds. If it wasn’t for Klopp we wouldn’t have gotten Salah, Van Dijk and Edderson. If it wasn’t for Klopp Trent wouldn’t be the world class full back he is. If it wasn’t for Klopp, Liverpool wouldn’t have ever made it big… He rebuilt that club from the ground up, giving it the best damn foundation we ever had. Jürgen motherfucking Klopp. 🫶🏻  Good luck, and thank you sir. For all the good memories, and the bad ones. You’re a legend, icon, and a hero all in one. May life treat you well.🫡
Unitedbros, we are so BACK
I'm just really crying, I followed Liverpool from the start of the 2000s. This is a shocker I've never felt when any of our star players or manager left, even Gerrard. Klopp brought us back again to the top, but we have to respect his decision. Much respect to the boss. YNWA
What this man has achieved in his career trascends trophies. He has shown the best there is to offer in humanity. He has given people hope.   All the best, Jurgen. YNWA.
😂😂 don't cry "Stevi G" is coming back and you will always have liv"VAR"pool .
What a Man ,legend
Legend!!!!!!!!❤️
Great interview, makes today feel much better..
😢...I'm heartbroken...
My goodness he's given everything. Heart and soul. I get being worn out. Best to go out while you can still give your all. What a class act. Still, a gut punch, and I teared up. I hope eventually he coaches somewhere again. ❤
You don't have to be a Liverpool fan to understand the impact Jürgen Klopp had on the team if you really are a football fan. It's not by luck that this person has remained the manager of the team since 2015. I wish him all the best after he quits Liverpool, your spell here will be remembered forever!
Pep G. Maybe thinking about doing the same?
the greatest liverpool coach ever, with the best squad they ever have, only 1 champions league and only 1 premier league. gonna be downhill from now on to where they belong. this past few years has been anomaly
Бүгін естіп көңіл күйім түсіп кетті. Мен бұлай аяқталады деп ойламадым. Ең кемі 10 жыл әлі басқарады деп ойлап жүрген едім. Ливерпуль және Клопп менің жүрегімде өте ерекше орын алады бұл өмірде. Ең бастысы жақсы менеджер келеді және ары қарай дамимыз деп үміттенейік. Менің клубымда Клопп секілді ерекше тұлға басқарғанына өте қуаныштымын. YNWA ❤😢🇰🇿
Knowing this will give everyone of us a drive to achieve everything we can, and enjoy the time Emperor Klopp still is here! The pressure he´s been under, he already abandoned his holiday when coming to Liverpool, not having had a break since. He won´t do anything with less than 100%, and if he knows he doesn´t have the energy to give 100%, there´s no way he´d keep underperforming. Now this is what we are going to do: EVERY fan, player, employee, whomever for Liverpool, will give their all to give Emperor Klopp the very least EPL -title, possibly three more for a farewell gift. Those who can go to the games, it´s time to give back; (I have chance to see 2 games at Anfield), us all must scream for the team like banshees, like never before.
One of the greatest managers. Wonder if we’ll see him back at the club in an executive role?
ABSOLUTE LEGEND!!!!! Much ❤Jurgen, you have been by far the best manager since King Kenny in my book, possibly better, thank you for your honesty, you clearly love Liverpool
This man deserves to be into top ten managers in Premier League's history and deserves a statue outside Anfield The only one that understood the real meaning o YNWA, and the one that returned Liverpool to its greatness. Danke Jürgen
The passion this man has and the passion he receives from the fans is immense! I’m a Chelsea fan and I find myself being emotional about this. Can fully understand him and can fully understand how this must feel for all the Liverpool fans.
WELCOME TO BAYERN!!
Liverpool is not only a team, its a familly, a legacy, a way of life & that man single handly lift that club to be among the best team again.
Total respect from a City fan. Wonderful Manager. Good luck Jürgen
From doubters to believers ❤. His story at this club is simply magical. YNWA
I am an Arsenal fan and I always envied Liverpool fans for having this man as a manager. I am so sad for you guys, but you must be so happy that Klopp was a part of your life. Good luck Kloppo, good luck Liverpool fans. You will never walk alone!
YNWA KLOPP ❤
As a Manchester united fan i will miss him in the prem hope u come back soon if not hope u have a good life☺️☺️☺️
Wish him the best rest of his life. Football will miss him. 😢
Pass auf dich auf Jürgen! Gesundheit ist alles. (krass deine Arbeit in Liverpool -- Respekt.)🖤💛
🥺
Love and respect from a Chelsea fan! Jurgen Klopp is a great role model on and off the pitch. Stay healthy!
This man oozes quality! His reasons for leaving is personal but he also is thinking about what is best for the club. So honest, altruistic,  and straightforward. There is not a manager like him!!!
I meant “respect for the fans” 😀
Please stay klopp
Very sad 😢
Building a statue of him is and will never be enough for what he did and the history he created.
This guy is a true gentleman. So honest and humble. He puts the club first, he has a lot of resources for the fans. The fact that he didn’t want to participate in the planning for the next season says all about his kindness and care for the club. Well done Mr. Klopp!
YNWA klopp is a God and honesty broke my heart but for the truth respect YNWAJFT96
Today is a sad day for me as a football fan. Living in Hawaii, I would get home from around 11 at night and Bundesliga would be on. Recently becoming a fan from playing fifa, i had no club so would just watch whatever game was on. The one club that I loved watching the most was Dortmund. Shortly after, he left for Liverpool and I followed him there. When I heard You'll Never Walk Alone as the players walked out on the pitch for the first time...I knew that I had finally found my club. It never would've happened if it weren't for Klopp. Such a special human being, he will be missed, and I hope Liverpool can give him a quadruple on the way out❤
Love the honesty by Jurgen Kloop
My favourite manager of all time 🔥
I respect Klopp to be honest with himself & simply say his health won’t be able to continue to match the intensity required in this role - great coach, greater man
He can’t stand living in Liverpool anymore with all the bin dipper’s everywhere, Fair play to him
L
What a human being. Privileged he managed our club and turned it into family. Absolutely devastated.  Hoping he returns one day soon! YNWA Jurgen Klopp❤
Man I’m going to be crying man 😢

Yay ! Loserfool is back!!!!😂😂
I respect you very much. What special people always want to do is live their lives like normal people. No one is braver than you. I love you Boss
Sad news!! You Always Walk Alone …. Arguably the best coach in the world.
No I am not ready for this😢😢
As a United fan it hurts to see a legend of a manager leave the Premier League. Thank you for everything Jurgen. All the best for the future ❤
the demise of liverpool will come ... he is the glue
Nooo who will be our manager now ♻️😭😭
I am an Arsenal fan. But I love Klopp. I'm going to miss him. How I wish my club should have got him first after he left Dortmund. But Wenger was stubborn and didn't want to leave 😂😂. I have high respect for this man. It's better to leave on high than to leave when things start getting bad. I know he will be the next Germany coach. Good luck to him. 🎉
Klopp is an absolute LEGEND for us - already gone down in history.  One of the best and most decent managers out there.  Your legacy will live on - I hope the team deliver the Premier League in 2024 to add to your already amazing legacy - no bigger incentive for 'The Normal One' / The BOSS.
😢😢😢
Simply one of the quality coaches and people in all of sports.   It was a privilege to be a Liverpool fan in his era.
Real Madrid manager 2025
We crying  Klopp plz Don't leave us
Thanks For Every Single Thing You Do For The Club And Us And The Happiness That You Give It To Us And Always Wish To Be Successful
Boys, our squad, see how many trophies, 1,2,3, or even 4 to farewell our BOSS
It is so hard to believe Jürgen is leaving.   Jürgen for Liverpool is a manager, a coach, a mentor, a leader, a father, a friend, and a team inspirer at the same time.   As Indonesian and Liverpool fan, I am expecting that Liverpool will stay with your phylosophy: work-hard ethos, effective football, and team cohesiveness.   I hope all players work altogether to make Liverpool winning the treble this year, and dedicate all the trophies as deference to Jürgen.  Amen.
this is the end. liverpoolfc is now doomed.
Always remembered klopp
We all knew that day would come and trust me its the right time for him to leave, and he will leave after creating history. Time will tell & we all will be here cheering for what he did for his last season as manager of the greatest team of all time.
xabi alonso will make an entrance.
You're gonna break our team jurgen..   please stayyyyyy 😢
is this the end💔💔......
There is nothing we can do...
He came a manager and left an absolute goat 🐐
❤️
Leaving on a high. Take care. Just don't block the LFC's number, you know
So does he have a contract with Real Madrid already?
Hey Jurgen,   Seeing as I know you will definitely read this comment 😂 I just want to say a huge thanks for everything, you have been an amazing manager but even more an amazing human being.   Wish you the best no matter where life now takes you.  I know you are a football manager but you are an inspiration to anyone who manages a team, showing how to get the best out of your team around you.  I Think This will be an amazing catalyst for the rest of the season. What more motivation would any group of players need.  Let’s win EVERYTHING!!!!!  YNWA
❤❤❤❤❤❤
best manager ever🤓
The closest manager so far to Sir Alex  in the premier league era. He brought the fans back to the glory days. He made the dans believe with his passion for the club like SAF did and achieve success beyond their imagination. Forever a great
I promise Jurgen will be back even if it's for just one day. I promise
broke my heart
Surely they have to give it to Gerard. Club legend and he knows the club inside out.
Thy only thing that we will never forget is that he was, is and will always be part of this familly & he also has a life which he want to live to the fullest with his familly and friends... We love you Sir. You'll Never Walk Alone
He'll be germany's new coach in a year
All good things must come to an end ,this man should be knighted .thank you Sir.
As a Dortmund supporter I can tell you nothing will ever be the same again
As a Man Utd Fan, I don't want him to leave Liverpool so soon. He is a Legend in our eyes and one of the best coaches of all time 😢
It’s nothing less than a devastating loss to the club.  The reality is probably that the times of challenging City at the level that we have been are probably over.  And it’s a terrible time for the club, with the rise of Newcastle coming, Arsenal on the doorstep, etc.  The “golden sky” is ending and a storm is coming again.  That said, can’t begrudge Jurgen in the slightest.  You know this has to be so difficult for him too, and open honesty with the club and supporters is so refreshing.  He has an immense amount of self-awareness to make this decision now.
Thank you, Jürgen, for everything you've done for Liverpool FC. I hope you find rest and enjoyment in your time away.  Let's go out on top.
You're welcome to Barca sir
This is sad..fucking sad…I love this guy without being German or a Liverpool fan..what a genius and a genuine human
He would still do take the German national team if he was offered it, part of me thinks that's why he's leaving
I wish you all the best, sir. To be honest, I'm really sad to hear this, but I support you with all your decisions. I wish you all the best in your next adventure. You'll never walk alone. You are always in my ❤.
legendddddd
As an arsenal fan I'm sad to see Klopp go humble manager
Good luck in the future Jurgen, Best manager in my time.
Great guy what a shock he's going to leave
Thank you for everything Jurgen, what you have done for this club and this city will never be forgotten
I'm big fan from Thailand...one question...why ?? I respect with your decision..... But your answer is didn't clear...so... I respect what you decide.....(love you Jürgen!!)
Thanx Jürgen for your development of the Club. And thanx for the early decision statement. BUT NOW, Reds, act fast and try to get Xabi Alonso for the next saison. He's doing an incredible job in Leverkusen, they're aiming for their first championship, they play with no doubt the BEST football in Germany for years (no comparison to boring Bayern or Dortmund). And - Xabi has a Liverpool background. So, hurry up before other clubs are faster. And - maybe he can persuade Florian Wirtz to come with him. By far the best german player in the Moment...and sooo young.
Heartbroken is an understatement how I’m feeling rn ngl 😢😢
While I respect Jurgen, I just want to see Carragher cry
While I am quite upset, I completely respect Jürgen’s decision
Legend! Go for everything this season, there will be a moment to be sad, but not today 🙌
Thankyou Jurgen for being in my eyes the greatest manager to manage my beloved reds thanks for making me dream again as a fan even you as a person tbh probably one of the nicest person I have ever known never met u but you were always there big thanks for helping me on my own recovery in life by giving me hope seeing my team grow strong all the cups our great team won over the years the only cup I ever wanted was world club and u got us that the memories with my loved ones experiencing watching us win those cups will live with me forever so Jurgen my great friend its not danke for now its business as usual and let's get as many cups as we can get and we're ever u go in life may the Lord jesus  christ bless u and your family always ynwa ❤❤❤❤❤
❤
Not acceptable Jurgen. This was a lifetime appointment. Sorry can't leave.
He deserves to spend time with his family. He's more than earned it. I'm truly heartbroken that he's leaving, but I think it's better to remember the amazing times we've had with Jürgen in charge. He will never be forgotten by the Liverpool fans, and we all wish him truly the best. YNWA.
Great manager great honest  interview good luck Jurgen,  the PL will be poorer without you!
As united fan im glad he's leaving bcs we won't get another 7-0 spanking but i truly respect jurgen for me he's a better coach than pep wish u well on his future endeavours
THIS MAN IS ONE OF A KIND!HE DESERVES TO ENJOY THE REST OF HIS LIFE WITH HIS FAMILY! RESPECT YNWA
A sucker-punch to the stomach. But I'm so glad he can leave on his own terms, he's more than earned the right.
To be honest, I'm both legit sad and glad. Sad for obvious reasons, But I'm glad that Jurgen can leave from his own will, for good reason, before he's too exhausted, sick or discredited as our coach. I reckon last season really took a tol on him, to an extent which I'm sure many of us thought he would leave or could be sacked... But he stood strong, was backed by both club and fans, and he had the force to put us back in our place, but even further beyond, we're title contenders, cups are here to take, and we just might get another european trophy, althought not the one Jürg deserves. I so hope we can all fight with all our might to get that quad we missed out in 22... I'm glad Jürgen can have his break. I'm so glad that Jürgen was a red. I'm so glad that he still is. And of course that he'll always be a red.
If this MAN doesn't deserve a statue than I don't know who does.
No words what a Man 🌟🌤
KLOPP IS A VERY DEEP PERSON! ILOVE YOU MAN
Horrible news, but also fantastic that Jurgen will never get sacked. I would have hated that more. He’ll leave with nothing but love and gratitude.
The normal one makes a normal decision. respect.
This breaks my heart, but my god i love you mate and everything you've given us. You're the king Jurgen. Love from Australia mate YNWA 😢
☹️🥲 so sad
No 1 on trending....shows how big this is 😮😮
Big fucking w for a Man United fan like me
saya menyukai tim ini karena Klopp 😢
WHYY?😢
OMG ...  He's won every trophy except the Europa League.  Gutted to hear this. We are  Liverpool, this means more. You created the Mentality Monsters.  THANK YOU Jurgen. You'll Never Walk Alone.
☹️🥲 so sad
As a manc and a red, Passion you have for your team, fans, and whole of Liverpool, You will be missed by whole of Liverpool. Hope your ok, take care .
Next England manager??
No mr klopp no not now you are our greatest manager at Liverpool you made Liverpool great again come on man our most important player at the club we love you man❤😰😥😥😢😫😩
Thanks for the memories.
He came with class, he won with class, he lost with class and now he is announcing his departure with class. I think it's the hardest thing in life to sense when the moment has come before it's too late. Respect and love Kloppo! May you have a long, healthy and happy life ♥️💛🖤
Your sooooo good but the fans including me understand
Respect for this trainer, example for the club but for sure for this trainer, hope he gets more private time now to reload his battery and enjoy life outside the football
"I underestimated the fact that my energy source is not endless and when I realized that I knew I had to tell people because that's what I owe you all." Honest statement and wise decision from a man who is not too proud to give up fame. Jürgen, I wish you all the best for your future and thank you so much for all those fantastic years in Liverpool!
He means a lot for the club & he did a lot for the club, i wonder who will come after him.. i know this sounds weird and with all respect to the other coaches but i only see klopp for now. But after 8 years and you winning everything i think its normal when it comes to leaving.. at the end of the day we all are humans and if we are empty we are empty.
No that is not good news  But we always remember your coach
Thank you for everything Jürgen❤
But thats good to live before its too late u can see MAN U siturgering because of Alexi Fg
became a football fan so late at the age of 26 and i had no regret choosing Liverpool as the club i support because of Darwin. Klopp will always have a special place in my heart for bringing Darwin into the club. he always believed in him no matter what, even when other people criticised him. if a new fan like me already feel devastated about his departure news, i cannot imagine how painful it is for long time supporters. what a legacy he left at the club. a legend. thank you and we will miss you dearly Klopp 🥺❤️
😢😢❤ up there with king Kenny you the best brought joy to us when we lost hope. I wish you ghe best and long happy life... But just for one more favor can u please put pep lijnders as our new coach ❤❤❤
YNWA ❤❤
I dont like Liverpool but i like the man. Sometimes moaned a bit too much about the weather and stuff but a great guy. Shits all over pep in terms of resource used
Wow 😢, every game was a joy with you even in the bad years. Watching Kloppo on the touch line gives me goosebumps, energy, drama ...
I’m a United fan, but I always thought Klopp was a class act, a real stand up guy. I wish him the best ✊🏻
After Dortmund he took a year off also and came back stronger. He looks tired and burned out. All the best Kloppo.
"Don't make these games about me.. I know about Our relationship, I dont need any kind of proof".. this was like a Father speaking to his Son🥺❤ Thank you Kloppo for everything, but its hard to hold back our emotions!!
wow, what a legend
Forever one of us. A once in a lifetime manager. Love you Jurgen
Klopp I would do anything for you to stay at this beautiful club if there is a problem please just don’t full on listen to me choose your decision
Something behind scenes for his departure imo
Probably the hardest decision he’s made in his career. Wish him the best.
Love you so so so much man...♥️♥️♥️♥️🥺 I understand you're decision very well and I respect it 👏👏👏 I'm so proud to be LFC fun and share this period with such a huge person 🙏 I hope the players understand you're decision and give everyone to win something in this last season. Love you so much and YNWA❤🤗
The press have been horrible to you lately, this will get them off your back. As an Arsenal supporter, you are the best thing to happen to this league in a long while. Any player would run through a brick wall for you, even us regular humans would. Thanks for your energy, I really hope you pip it this year. A lovely send-off for an incredible Man! Love from all the way down in London. Looking forward to seeing your next formidable team!
This came as a shock to me! I'm gutted we're about to lose one of the greatest managers out there! I wish you all the best Jurgen!
If we put all the victories aside, beneath it all is such an amazing human being. What a leader with the incredible courage to be honest and integral. God speed Klopp. Be well.
Reading between the lines of the content of what he said.  It sounds like there’s an underlying issue causing him to make this decision.  If you look at what he’s accomplished with Liverpool and in the process of accomplishing this season, something suggests to me that it’s a personal issue. You don’t just wake up one morning as a successful top level manager and decide to retire. I’m not a Liverpool fan but as a human being and fanatic of German football and culture I wish him well for the future. Weil Glück Jurgen habe einem gutes Leben! viel Spaß vielen Dank für alles! Gott segne!
😭😭😭😭 what are we gonna do but Thats life we shall miss u take care Thxs for the moment on Liverpool 👋
Class through and through.
Thamk you for everything Jurgen brought so much joy to all of us  ❤ YNWA
Wish this was said at the end of the Premier league
He’s going to Madrid
감사했습니다. 앞으로도 응원할게요 영원한 마음 속 최고의 감독님.
Vielen dank Jurgen!
When Gerard left I felt same as I am feeling today. Why?? He can stay as sir Ferguson. I cant see anyone better than him.. he worked 200% for Liverpool sacrificing everything now he need to look after his family and his health else he may break down.
Thanks to klopp for all the true enjoyment I've had during his run. Can't blame him for needing to step down. Hopefully can leave with another PL title if the refs stop being paid by oil clubs  I'm sure that's partly the reason he is tired of this nonsense.
From a fulham fan   I  just like to say to all you  Liverpool fans that   Jurgen  klopp   he is a legend
For the sake of the club, this is the perfect time to leave. Maybe not for this season but for the future of the club. The club has many months to prepare for the transition and the summer transfer window.
“It would be really cool, if you would just accept my decision as a difficult one, but a right one.”  Let this man go in peace, he deserves that - it’s very wise of him to know when to stop and it very graceful of him to do so, and it’s ultimately beneficial to the club that he did.
Shankly left in a similar position. At the top.
SOMETHING PERSONAL IS WRONG. MUCH LOVE TO KLOPP, HOPEFULLY WE WONT ENTER A SLUMP.
Iconic, legendary, and virtually mythical. Thank you, Jurgen, for all the joy, celebrations, and trophies you have brought us over these years. We can hold our heads up high as we sit on the pedestal that you put us back on. Let's make this a season finale for the history books 👍🏾 Keep On Keeping On JURGEN, YNWA ✊🏾
😢😢💔💔
bro, you have to come to barcelona !!
the greatest coach ever
😢😢 YNWA JFT97 TIA COYR 😢😢
As a United fan, this is bitter sweet. Do I want him to F off of course 100% lol but without a doubt will be a great miss for the Premier League
Great manager with a big personality. I wish him all the best.
Thank you so much Jurgen for all that you've done for us.  We achieved remarkable things in the last 9 years & we are so thankful for all of the happy memories gathered along the way, that will always stay with us.  Good luck in whatever you do next & you will always be welcome back here.  YNWA
I'm crying alot  Most upest time of my whole life that i already have experienced🥲
a legend
Need to lie down after that. Let's finish with a bang!
As a blade😏 this man is a class act. Let the roasting begin😂
Gutted!!😮 but i respect his decision!! 😔 it’s a sad day, but need to fight to the end of the season!!👍🙆🏼  gutted…… absolutely gutted.  Bless you Jurgen . We will always have you in our hearts. 😕❤️ just love you as a person and I’ve never known a manager like you. We put our arms around you in support 🥰
all love and respect to you sir
💔💔💔
Honest to god we will never get another manager like klopp cannot imagine no more fist pumps and his very honest post match interviews but I cannot imagine anyone loving our club and supporters the way this great man does  he has proved so many times what this club means to him I am truly heartbroken😖😣☹️😩😫😭
thank you gaffer  YNWA❤
'All good things...'.  Reading between the lines, I'm getting the impression Jurgen is just starting to realise there's little more he can add.  To be at, or at the very least near the top for so long must be an absolute drain on him not only physically, but mentally AND emotionally.  This man, Jurgen Klopp, has for me redefined the term commitment.  In all my 62 years, I have never seen a man commit himself to a cause the way this guy has for Liverpool.  Talk about mind body and soul!  This man has given everything and it shows in the way Liverpool have come from 'also rans' to potential champions for a second time.  It's astonishing.  I cannot praise this guy highly enough - Herr Klopp, Sir, ich grüße Sie.  ❤❤👏🏾👏🏾
Just one year of training Nunez and he's out of energy 😅😂
Simply put, Mr Klopp is fed up with being a football manager
Wow, I'm numb after to hear this out of klopp mouth. 😢
Hope the team will win the championship and hope Kloppo will have the time to live a "normal" life.
As a toffee this man has been incedible with his management and passion for the City of Liverpool itself, wish him all the best for the future if it is just retirement to enjoy the rest of his life then fair play to him
As a united fan, this man is a legend
Klopp: Liverpool > Klopp Liverpool: Liverpool ❤ Klopp
what a legend , what a manager, what a human being, there will always be the upmost love and respect for Jurgen Klopp
Of course such decisions have to come in life and the only person to be employed for that job is xabio Alonso
alles richtig gemacht...er hat seine Aufgabe erfüllt
😭😭😭
Noooooooooooo😢😢😢
His Netflix special gonna be fire🔥 can't wait!
Auf Wiedersehen Lar 👋
One of the greatest managers of modern footballl big thanks sir .i wish you could retire in Liverpool fc
It’s just very sad moment for all of us who love football . I am a long time Chelsea fan and I must tell you that Jurgen made the game so beautiful he could be in any team the result would be the same. Good bye Mr Klopp.
The man is a fantastic character and and a very nice man....he just want's a break.   He is pretty much set for life and now wants to spend time with the family. Completely understand that...the PL still wont be the same though....
Очень грустно :(((
Premier league is in doubt with this manager, he is the best  He made 97 and 92 points without title, he didn’t win because there a cheating team in the competition, this is why he is tired.  Manage Liverpool is not easy, you have to win without a big cash budget.  Klopp is the number one, and it’s the biggest lose for that league
as a man u fan i am sorry for the loss
Those City vs liverpool matches will never be the same anymore
"when was the last time you cried ?" me; when kloop left Liverpool
The 2nd best Austrian ever.
Thank you for everything Jürgen, you will never walk alone in this thing called life.
The world needs somebody like him.  What a human being!!
Jose would be perfect
See you again Jürgen Norbert Klopp😔
I  begrudge him a “normal life” so much! He gave and gives his love, his life to football... he should be able to enjoy everything after football. I am a BVB supporter myself and through him, I also became a LFC supporter. Just  big thank you, Kloppo!   YNWA❤
im a barca fan and im shook , a very big part of not just liverpool but football as a whole is leaving and i feel extremely sad , the greatest liverpool manager of all time and perhaps one of the greatest in pl history ! thanks boss cheers !
Off course this has negative impact on the team
This is the day I dread.....our second coming finally leaving us.....
He is afraid of Drakola of continuing  rivaly and high competition as getting more and more , klopp flop 😅😅😅😅😅😅
I think a world war is about to break this year or the next. Klopp is influential enough to get that inner info. He obviously needs to spend quality time with his family
男人大丈夫，拿得起，放得下！
Klopp will go out on top. This is how the story is supposed to end…In life, you got to know when enough is enough. Dictate your own terms and go out ON YOUR OWN TERMS….Klopp did that and I’m happy for him 👏🏾
Seems like because of last season they wanted him out but now because how good he made the team again now they want him kinda sad for me they ddnt plan on having him next season or give him signings
Thank you
it hurts, it hurts !!!  very similar to a breakup from a person you really loved :(
I love klopp so much and I cried soo much I will cry in till  a die
Get DeZerbi from Brighton
This is just heartbreaking to see but we all support your decision !! THANK YOU KLOPP ‼️❤ YNWA ❤️❤️❤️
As a city fan I’m gutted. Much respect for the manager and the man. Undoubtedly would have won much more without Pep around and rivalries aside, he gave us some fantastic battles. Liverpool were already winning the league this year in my opinion but this will galvanise the team to ensure they win it for Klopp. Respect ✊
This man was the only thing standing in pep's way. Bro, teams in the prem better pray liverpool gets a great manager to replace him because blood 😂 It's done for the league.   I'm a city fan btw
As a United fan I am glad he's going, but the Premier league are also going to miss him. I wish him all the best.
Thank you for beautiful Working and good luck for you and family, so long!
Sou brasileiro e torcedor do Liverpool, descanse Jürgen, vc merece descansar. Agradecemos imensamente pelo trabalho incrível que você fez aqui nos Reeds, agradecemos a sua simpatia e carisma nas coletivas e na beira do campo, agradecemos a cada jogador que vc fez se tornar craque, e cada gol feito pela sua equipe, cada vitória, cada título. Mas independentemente de qualquer circunstância: "YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE" Jürgen Kloop, vc tem fãs pelo mundo todo, e seu legado nunca será esquecido, independentemente em qualquer circunstância.🔴⚪⚽🏆
Will never forget what he did for us. It's was a privilege to watch his incredible team conquer it all. I hope we can do again this season. ❤❤❤
hopefully the lads can use this to push and fight for everything whats left to win. We're in a final already, on top of the league. At this point the league should be the priority
I’m not a Liverpool fan and I genuinely feel heartbroken. He’s a really good man. I wish him all the best in whatever decisions he makes going forward.
A good baller, a better manager and the best human being! Thank you klopp for everything and hope we make the quadruple this year! Boom!
Heart broken :( please don't go
feel like ive lost a loved one
when you employ Klopp, you have to take the whole one. Sad but accepted
Simply gutted 😢...no way we been blessed to have him
This is so sad
Can still be the manenger for the game on sunday please 😢😢😢
❤😢
God love him he needs time to himself and his family thank you jurgen klopp for the greatest days of my football fan life 💙 but I'm gutted klopp I only see you and the fist pumps
YNWA
inject it hagahahahahahha🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Highest respect for Klopp
_Klopp's_ premature exit is the second worst news I have received, the only worse news being my Mom's passing. This will hurt for a very, very long time. Over time, the depth of my respect for _Klopp_ the human and _Klopp_ the best football manager will help ease the pain. *_YN❤WA_*
What a great man he is. Full respect to him & everything he has done for Liverpool FC. Their fans naturally will be saddened by the news, but should very quickly turn to enjoying the rest of the season ahead and giving him the send off he deserves, whatever happens.  The Prem is losing a great that’s for sure. 👏🏼
As a Man Utd fan, full respect for Klopp. Great manager who just felt drained physically n mentally... A great loss to EPL end of season
I would love Gerard to take over. Thank you Klopp- what a man what a manager
Best manager. Great great respect for Jurgen, not only as a manager, but also as a person. All the best Jurgen, enjoy the time for yourself and your family!
Nah man nah wholefted Liverpool flopped so klop stay pls
I'm not even a Liverpool fan I support Man united but he was such an amazing manager Sorry to all Liverpool fans ❤
😢😢
Thank you klopp for doing everything you have done,
Please don't leave.... You promised us we will never walk alone 😢😢 please think again.... Think about the fans they are your family 😢😢 omg I can't stop crying 🥺😭
May your future plans be blessed abundantly, enjoy the new beginnings, thanks for the memories. Couple of trophies before you go.❤🇨🇮
Absolute legend! Blessed to have had Klopp as our manager. This era will be looked back on for so many years to come.
He’s gave us everything. Won everything. To the rivals who make fun of him leaving, let me say it like this 😂 we lived in times you could only dream of.
Thank you for these 9 amazing Years Jurgen🥲 You are a Legend and what you have done for this club has been absolutely incredible. Can’t stress enough on the Thank you!❤️ Get that statue up ASAP😌 This feels like I’ve lost a member of my family to be honest 😮‍💨
He’s going real after ancelotti contract is over. Guaranteed. Heard it here first.
The man deserves his break.Thank you Klopp, its been a great ride, wouldn't change anything. You Will Never Walk Alone
I cant imagine liverpool withouth jurgen, it just feels like a yesterday 😰 but thank you for all you've done for our club. You are always in my heart.
I'm sad
Sad for the club but very happy for Herr Klopp...Good on him for being true to himself and dead honest with the club and his fans... All the Best to him and his family 🎉
This is bad news, I hope he comes back after his break.
Thank you Jurgen ❤️
You're the best manager ever in the history of Liverpool Klopp.. We will miss you so much. YNWA♥
Dalglish got his eish. Gerrard on the way back
I am a West Ham and I have to say it is a great loss for the Premiership with Klopp leaving!!!   .......but hey on the positive side Stevie Gerrard can now take charge and we can see how good he is as a manager. 😉
Jurgen we love you, I accept the decision
Not a Liverpool fan but you gotta respect greatness
Now watch this team go into overdrive to Win this Title for This Great man Its The Very Least He Deserves..❤❤❤
England fa should offer him as much money as humanly possible to take the England job and get rid of that waste of space Southgate
I understand everything he said. But I am just so sad. Beyond football he is a special person to get to listen to. I learned from him. I will miss you Jurgen.
Best to go out on your own terms. Fantastic manager and leader.
❤
never was so much owed to one man.  he took us to the greatest heights and did everything with his head held high and created a team culture to be proud of and constructed a team that can win today and the day's to come.  We were truly blessed to have him as long as we did and it is up to us to carry on what he started and the best goodbye we can give him is to support the team more now than ever and help the team win everything we can to send him off in the manner he deserves.  He is leaving on his own terms and not many get to do that in this business.  YNWA.
Thanks for everything so far Jugen and I wish you and your family all the best in the future. All things change and much as I would love you to stay a little longer, at our age everything takes it's toll. You have understood this club like nobody since Kenny and before him Shankly. Best wishes for the future and let's win everything and make it an incredible exit... You do know that you will NEVER WALK ALONE...
What a star ,thank you and goodluck in the future great man.
Great manager!!! Respect ❤
Gutted is an understatement 😫  thank you so much. 😢 let's win the lot for him 🙏❤️
Klopp❤❤😢 <3
😢
As a barca fan i dont really support LFC but Klopp is one of the greatest managers in football history
LFC Fan all the way from Nigeria....the last time i felt this pain in my heart is when i lost my dad. I will miss you Klopp...really really miss you. Thank you for making us believe..thank you for bringing us out of our ruins.....if you say you want to come back, God knows we would have you back in open arms a thousand times. Now lets go end this season on a HIGH!
Thank you klopp for saving my club. What you've done for lfc will leave on for many years, legacy ynwa.
2010년부터 팬인데... 느낌이 여자친구랑 헤어진 것  같다
It's like Kenny quitting, body blow
Go to TJ , Mexico 🎉 El Salvador live LIFE🎉
Words can’t describe the level of respect I have for this man. You deserve everything you want, Jurgen. We will always love you❤️❤️❤️
Thank You Jurgen. I can’t say anything else. You’ll never walk alone.
Probably one of the few really honorable person on the top level who is respected by all the football fans and experts no matter what club they support or work for. He will be missed and I wish him all the best, but I also hope we will see him again maybe after a few years of break.
Huge respect from an Arsenal fan
I hope after the EM he is headcoach from germany than❤
U made us believe that dreams do come true.
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😭 It hurts..
Heartbreaking news, but it makes sense. You are a real manager, a real legend, and a real role model of mankind . Thank you, Klopp. we love you ,we respect you.
Terkejut dan tidak menyangka😱😭 fans dari indonesia bogor Tajur babadak,, sosok klop yg telah membawa kejayaan liverpool lg sekarang mau tinggalin th Reds.
I am a Manchester united fan but this guy is genius.. all respect.. could you coach my team united😮 even if it's one season. You are a splended coach. Tough guy aggressive. Huuuuuu how will Liverpool manage
Klopp wants bayern lol
It's not the end just yet, we still got half a season left, so let's save the goodbyes till the end of the season and back the lads to the best of our ability YNWA❤❤❤
23:32 This message is what we should get behind. A fairytale ending. Win the title(s) Go out with a bang !!! YNWA!!! COYR!!!
Jürgen Klopp under Liverpool is something the world will remember.. YNWA❤
I love boss
Devastated but respect his decision and wished him well for his next chapter!  Jurgen deservers his break.   Let's go for another special memorable season together with the remaining 30 games.
"A difficult one, but the right one." I can really feel that.  It shows why you are the boss / the true leader.  We will miss you.
My day is ruined
Danke Jürgen! YNWA <3
Sad to lose him for he boosted the Premier league, go to Utd I say.
You made me start watching football.
He's been forced out by nsg no money to spend in transfer windows he will never be replaced
What a legend,  I am a Benfica fan, and a fan of Jürgen Klop.  Football will be hungry for your return. I hope you win everything and after the break come back even stronger...  I can't hold my self to ask you to think about Benfica, and enjoy Portugal :)  Best luck for you and Liverpool.
Welcome to Vietnam. I wanna see u here
The club executive lost confidence in Klopp last season and I think he felt left alone the club executive didn't realize the club's motto says “Never walk alone “. The club came back strong 💪 and he decided to make his decision.
Jurgen you are a great person..very few people understand themselves..kia kaha..
Man like Klopp. Good on you and you left an impression on the prem. Enjoy what’s next
i am a man united fan that being said what a man he is, what a role model to young people, what a human being. special people like this only come once in a while, jurgen if you read this I  applaued you well done you have done for liverpool is amazing bravo..
best coach ever Jurgen klopp  😍
Courageous Leadership at its finest 👏🏿👏🏿
What a remarkable manager. His legacy, his personalty, the influence will never be forgotten not only in Liverpool but also the Premier League and football in general.
PLEASE JURGEN WE NEEED SOME ONE ELECTRIC AND AS AMAZING AS U
I’m genuinely in tears .. I’ll forever love this man ❤
He is amazing manager and human being. Hope he can enjoy his life and come back to field   From Spurs fan.  Big respect !!
Klopp is one of Liverpool's greatest gaffers. If I am so weak after hearing this, how would these players be... I will always love Klopp: his passion, dedication....is top-notch for me.😢missing him already 😢
Brought a bit of a tear to my eye. Thank you so much for everything Jurgen, you are forever etched into the history of Liverpool FC. Now lets win all those fucking trophies!!
Amazing manager and more important, human being. Been in love with this guy as a football fan since his days at my club in dortmund. Sucks go lose a legend, buf I'm glad he's gutsy and bold enough to make the right choice for his life. Hope he finds happiness and if he wants to come back go football, any club would take him. Probably the best manager in the world. There's nobody like him and how he inspires people, motivates players. ❤
im not a liverpool fan but quiet sad
What a fantastic guy. All the best from a Saints fan.
Legend
memories forever jk
I thought I was strong enough to watch this video, but I can't 😭
He turned us from "doubters to belivers"... What a legacy 👏
Thank you for all the fantastic memories, Jurgen!  YNWA  😢
BVB fan from Germany here. Jürgen is one of the all time greats. Wherever he went, he won. A lot. And on top of that, he's a class act. Sad day for Liverpool, but everything has to end. It's better to leave on your own terms.
what a beautiful human being....so honest, so humble, so direct and so thoughtful. it's no wonder he has been able to manage and motivate our team to such greatness .... who wouldn't follow and listen to him when he talks and thinks like this ... thank you Jurgen Klopp for all you have done, for recreating greatness for us, for all the happy memories and for all the energy you brought with you
The club will find it very difficult to replace this gentleman.
Thank you for everything ❤❤❤....thank you for making me fall in love with this club, this team. YNWA❤
Thank you Jurgen for everything you've done at our great club. Will be sorely missed   Really hope he can go out winning  the premier league
This is the worst possible news not just for Liverpool fans but for the whole world.  How will the multi millionaire Liverpool players cope? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm not a Liverpool fan but I imagine watching this interview must be like hearing your wife asking for a divorce.
We’ll all miss you, Klopp.
Lets have 1 last Fucking Amazing season Jurgen, you will be missed ❤YNWA
he should give us one more signing (he should pick one coach good  for Liverpool)
Gutted is an understatement, beyond a legend
YNWA Jurgen!
Just 🐐
Thanks a lot klop
Today is the New Black Friday!  But to all my Liverpool Fans, here is a quote that summarizes our Great Modern Leader's time at Liverpool  'Ursula K. LeGuin' -                        ' It is good to have an end to this journey…                         But it is the journey that matters, in the end.'
Total respect and understanding, thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!
what an incredible man, coach, and most importantly, human being. i am so sad to hear he will be leaving Liverpool and the Premier League, but his legacy will always remain. thank you for everything Jurgen, you’ll never walk alone. ❤
Ich glaube Jürgen Klopp, hat alles der Mannschaft gegeben, was er geben kann, deswegen finde ich die Entscheidung, dass Team zu verlassen respektabel. Ich wünsche Liverpool und Klopp viel Glück 🤞
It's a sad, sad day for all LFC fans around the world.  I owe Jürgen and this team so much for everything they achieved over the last 3-4 years.  Unknowingly, they played an integral part in helping me through one of the toughest periods of my life and I have this man, and this club, to thank for essentially saving my life.  This hurts, a lot- but, I'll be forever grateful to Jürgen for the all that he has helped this club achieve during his time here, and for the memories that I'll cherish forever.  YWNA, Jürgen Klopp ❤
As a United fan, i’ll just say one thing, i’ll never miss pep when he leaves city, but i’ll always miss Klopp
Please don't leave Klopp 😢😢😢
I'm not fan, but really I love coach klopp❤️  I respect him and appreciate what he does and what he has done. All the best and success to him in all aspects of his life. Stay strong fan Liverpool, the best is coming for you guys ❤️ All salute 🫡   from Milanista to you ❤️🖤 Forza Liverpool ❤️
im a man utd fan and this is the best news ive heard in a long while scousers in the mud
I'm floored.holy hell
To the ppl sayin ‘hE OnLY WOn OnE titLE!’ , he won them their first league title in 30yrs! Bet most that have said it have never won a title! The man’s a fucking legend and got them “back on their perch”. Big respect to this man.  Leicester fan. (Also title winners)
People who cried watching this (Thanks for the 3 likes)  👇
Replacement  is Ten Hag
LEGEND 🧨🧨🧨
</3
One of the greatest man managers, master tacticians, cunning, inspiring, loyal and all round unbelievable manager! This is as big as Ferguson leaving Man united The prem has because a greater place with him in it! From a non Liverpool fan I feel for them! Klopp is pure Box office and for me the best manager on the planet!
I don’t know what I say but thank you for everything you’re the best manager of all time for this club ❤❤❤
Players will GIVE EVERYTHING to bring Klopp The Premier League title, sure of it. And they just might, looking good!
I like him better than any player in history. Im in shock
Respect 🫡
Thank You Mr Klopp ❤  another Legendary Liverpool Manager.  Enjoy your Life 😊
We'll miss him but he's earned the right to have the normal life he craves. He has his priorities in order. I hope he gets to sign off in style.
Sad😢 and Happy😂 at the same time😮
Please stay 🙏 😪 😢
He was a perfect fit from the start. Thanks Klopp, we respect and understand your decision. You will be missed.
When I left Dortmund, I said it's not important what people think when you come in but they think when you leave. ---Jürgen Klopp.
Ywna ♥️
Couldn't stop smiling throughout the entire video. What a guy! He knows what's best for him and when to step back. Good for him!
Tengo sólo dos nombres en mente para sucederlo, Xavi Alonso y mi principal candidato Miguel Ángel Sánchez Muñoz, del Girona de España la gran sorpresa del fútbol mundial, señores...a ir con todo por él....
This guy made me a Liverpool Fan.. Thanks for everything
Its heart breaking news😓 thx Jurgen❤   what next......??? For LFC.  YNWA 💪💪💪
Klopp class act all the way. I am literally afraid for the next manager who has to fill these shoes. It could get very ugly very fast!
We love you Yurgen ! ❤️ YNWA
Very respectful person.. amazing personality..  Time passing so fast. .. look how old we are became now .. Money not everything.. life .. family .. more important..  Thanks you coach .. and let's get some more last trophies together..  Good luck 🤞
I can't blame the gaffer he have done everything we ever needed him or wanted him to do! You are a club legend Jurgen Klopp what you mean to us will never be explained in actual words...you are the breath of inspiration and a ray of success as much this hurts our gratitude is much more bigger; ❣from doubters to believers go live your life Boss You'll Never Walk Alone
Health is wealth Jurgen, life is short. You'll be missed
I'm not a Liverpool FC fan but I have huge respect for Manager Klopp. He made the club and the league better.
Kann ich absolut nachvollziehen alles Glück für Liverpool und auch für Klopp. Auszeit muss sein 😃✌️
All the best in your next chapter 🙌
1) I'm a Real Madrid supporter 2) Most of the time when I watch videos - I skim through the content  But I watched every single second of this video, because Klopp is already a legend of the sport.  In an ideal world (for me), when Don Carlo's contract is up in 2026, Klopp will be rested by then and take over Real Madrid.
Welcome to Barcelona...
Nooooooo
I said this was happening at end of last season, could tell the way the team played last season, it was his final season
ユルゲンをプレミアリーグのトップへ。
We have had a Great time under Klopp Always loved  and sadly missed  God bless him 🙏  Love him 😢
If I were a LIVERPOOL fan, I would have been DEVASTATED from inside. As a Chelsea fan I have nothing but IMMMEEENSEE RESPECT for Klopp and Klopp's fist. I will miss it P.S.- Carabao cup has just become extremely important for both the clubs. Meet you on 25th Feb Sir Klopp
Roberto De Zerbi welcome to Anfield as you take the torch from our legend boss I Will Miss you Juren and thanks for placin us back into life. I see Jurgen as the next Germany boss which will give him more time in life..
The end of a great era
😢 and that’s how our struggle started 😢
Usa get him please
We will never forget one of the best coaches in the history of the beautiful game😢
Thank you for everything Jürgen...YNWA
By klopp
I understand what Liverpool fans may be feeling. I experienced this when Pep left Barcelona.  It's gut wrenching
Best Liverpool coach ever!
Just a whole hearted thank you Jurgen.
Legend YNWA ❤
Hi See Ya, Souness In 😂
Noooooooooo
You are the best and we will miss you big man
What a manager, what a man. Let's go Liverpool, Y.N.W.A!!
Let's win everything for Klopp !
A legend... YNWA❤
West Ham fan here , gutted his leaving
😢
Danke Klopp. All or nothing. He definitely left a mark and made people cry. Last part really had me in tears
Give pep Ljinders a chance
What?
Respekt Jürgen. Du bist eine Legende.
The Last Dance YNWA
He needs some time off his done a lot for the club but now it's time for him to rest and try a new challenge maybe in la Liga in a new environment
I'm a Bayern fan and don't care too much about the Premier League, but Klopp has had my respect and admiration ever since that 2013 Der Klassiker UCL final. He's a brilliant manager who brings passion and heat into the game. As a fellow German and Christian, I wholeheartedly love him and wish him the best in the future.
I love you klopp
It’s sad to see Klopp leave! YNWA herr Klopp
Awesome Coach!

Qué será del Liverpool sin nuestro Jürgen??? Sólo invocar al equipo a que lo gane todo, sólo así se quedará....
من عربي مصري مشجع لنادي ليفربول الاداره فرطت وتخلت عن افضل مدرب رائته عيني وداعا يورجن كلوب
Absolutely gutted I knew this day would come but not this soon 😢
❤️❤️❤️❤️Legend
As a Spurs supporter...i wish Jurgen all the  best he will be missed
Klopp saw the Swiss format champions league and the world club championship and thought sod that I’m off
I am curious to see where he goes next. Thank you for the memories and all the wonderful moments. You will be dearly missed! 😢
KLOPPMake

❤️❤️
Honestly this is the worst day of my Footballing life
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ah man January 2024 has been the ending of so much. From my 7 year relationship to some of my favourite forms of entertainment and now my club's manager. Truly the beginning of a new chapter in all of our lives. For anyone who relates, we'll get through don't worry.
😢😭😭😭😪
Found out in school so hard not to cry love you Jurgen
Sei dir sicher das wir dich verstehen,all das was du für diese Familie (Liverpool) getan hast wird dir nie vergessen. Du hast unser vollstes Verständnis,wir sind KLOPPO und KLOPPO ist Liverpool.
He has given us so many memories to cherish, so many moments to be proud of, a legend of a man, not just for liverpool but for english football, god i will miss him so much, a once in a lifetime kind of manager, nobody will fill his shoes , jurgen klopp, the normal one who turned doubters to believers, thank you for everything. You will always be one of us.
arsenal fan here. wish him all the very best
Forever we will remember love and respect Jurgen ❤ sad day but happy to have had him. You'll never walk alone Jurgen
Ohhhhhhh No....

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No words, just tears.
Wonderful manager. Wonderful man.
I remember 9 years ago when He said  ( I’m the normal one )  Absolutely amazing person! I will miss him so much! But what we can say? Good luck 😊
As a United fan I will really miss this legend in premiere league. A great manager with great personality. I wish him luck for his future endeavours. Really sad hearing this news 😞
😭😭😭😭😭😭i found joy in Klop's reign, he really earns respect, i really respect ur decision
Am a Chelsea supporter but am so suddened by his departure.. Premier league Was really competitive coz of him.. Wishing you all the best. To all Liverpool fans, YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE
....
Thank You, Boss🥲 You will be remebered forever. You will be in the hearts of millions of us. you will never walk alone, Boss.
The last Episode of Ted Lasso coming true. 😭
Danke Boss! We will miss and always support you! YNWA!!!
❤
I'm an Arsenal supporter, but always had so much respect for this man. The guy lived and breathed Liverpool. It's sad to see him go, but he definitely deserves a break. Would have loved to see him come to Arsenal after his sabbatical, but as he said, that will never happen. Shows his true love for his team. Well done Sir, you are a legend and will never be forgotten.
Simply The Boss..better than all the rest
One word: Ehrenmann! Is there an English expression for that? 🤔 „Man of honour“?
Thank you for everything you have done. It won't be the same without you. I hope you have a happy retirement.
Wake up and see this news 😢 sad day but this is life.Everything is come and go .You will never walk alone
Love you Jurgen
Jurgen Klopp benar, liverpUEL tidak akan berakhir dan tidak ada ujungnya
Thank you for everything Jurgen
내가 이 팀이랑 이 감독을 별로 좋아하지 않았었는데 갑자기 이 시즌 끝나고 떠난다고 하니 좀 그리워질거 같다 난 저렇게 선수들의 긴장을 풀어주는  감독은 이 감독이 최고 일 것이다 이 영상 속에서 그는 웃고 있지만 사실은 웃고있지 않을 것이다 난 이 시즌 리버풀이 우승하지 않았으면 좋겠다고 생각했지만 떠난다고 하니  차라리 리버풀이 트레블을 하고 그가 마지막 으로 트로피를 들고 행복하게 은퇴 하는 것이 그림  으로서 제일 보기 좋을것이다 은퇴를 하지 않으면 좋겠지만 리버풀이 조1위니 트레블을 하고 그가 우승컵을 들고  은퇴 하는게 더 나을것이다.
i am not even a liverpool fan, why am i sad...
Quality time you’ve given the Club - hopefully you can do the same for yourself and your family! You can’t buy time!  Solid throughout!  💪👌🏻💪
He is always the pride of Liverpool. A very honest man with big heart. You will always be in the heart of every Liverpool fan. Your success will follow you wherever you go simply because you are honest and truthful to everything and everyone around you. I ❤ you Jurgen. YNWA from my HEART.
I am not fine with his decision, he should have waited until the end of the season, something like this happened when sir Kenny Dalglish resigned middle of the season  the team when down the drain.
Absolute LEGEND... WE WILL MISS YOU.. I GOT TIERS RUNNING DOWN MY FACE WRITING THIS... THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.  YNWA❤
7:57 to 8:33 is where I realised it's the ownership that's the problem.
Oh no, the time has come that we hear you are leaving us. We knew this time would come and I would like to say thank you for all you have done for us. You have accomplished so much and won us so many titles and we will miss you deeply and wish you all the best. YNWA 😌
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Jurgen, thank you for all that you have done for Liverpool FC. You absolutely deserve to leave on your own terms. You have to follow your heart, trust your instincts, and do what's right for you. You only get one chance at this life. Of course I don't want you to leave, but I fully accept your decision and will forever be grateful for everything that you and your teams achieved since you joined the club. Walk on, walk on...
😢😢😢😢😢
He'll end up at Madrid just can't say it directly
Can't believe this is true sad. Xabi in summer
Sigo al Liverpool desde hace muchos años, recuerdo en las epocas en donde los apoyaba y a pesar de los esfuerzos no lograbamos nada, me emocione cuando llego Jurgen y no me equivoque cuando pense que era la mejor opcion para el club. Honestamente esta desicion me hizo llorar pero le deso mucho exito y agradezco todo lo que logro por el club. YNWA desde México
Thank you BOSS
He will possibly be the German 🇩🇪 national team manager next. I wish him all the best for whatever he does next, he’ll always be in my heart ❤️. YNWA
From an Arsenal fan ... I'll always cherish the memories n verve Jürgen brought to the EPL 🔥💪...will miss him around once he's gone... hopefully he gets to manage the German national team n bring back it's glory days🙏
Einfach danke für alles Jürgen
Ah man, he's thinking about Dáire, the young Irish fan, even now.. that's why we love Jürgen Klopp.
blaaa bla bla
😢
Thank you for Everything Jurgen klopp❤️🔥😭
Jurgen Klopp akan menjadi pelatih terbaik liverpool sepanjang masa , thanks Klopp , ynwa🙌
I'm so glad that Jurgen is a Red. I'm so glad he delivered what he said. Jurgen said to me, you know. We'll win the Premier League, you know. He said so. I'm in love with him and I feel fine <3
03 04년도 직관 한 이후 줄곳 응원해온 팀. 잘할땐 잘해서 즐거워서 못할 땐 덩치큰 애들 두들겨 패는걸 볼고 목 놓아 응원했지. 비록 암흑기였지만 그 암흑기에 한줄기 빛이 되어준 이가 클롭이었고 그는 늘 약속을 지키던 사람이었지. 지금 이 순간만큼은 그저 입을 열면 나오는 모든 말이 거짓말이길 바랄 뿐이지만 그는 그런 사람이 아니지 현지 팬들에겐 어떨지는 모르겠지만 제라드가 팀에서 그 순간도 이 정도까지 심장에 구멍이 뚫린 느낌은 아니었어. 첫사랑과 헤어지던 그 날 보다 지독해 얼굴 표정이 심하게 안좋은지 마누라가 뭔 일인지 걱정을 할 정도야. 지금은 심란해서 잠이 안올 정도고 그냥 가시는 그 길 쓸어 담아갈 수 있는 모든 영광이랑 영광은 다 쓸어가주셨으면 싶다. 동화같은 시작은 기대하지 말랬던 그가 보여준 이 동화는 내 생에 가장 멋진 동화였다. 감사한다.
I’m a Liverpool hater, but this news is heartbreaking. The football this man brings out game in game out is everything I love about football. I hope and pray he continues managing teams/clubs else it be a colossal loss for world football. Please dnt stop Jurgen
Your last celebration boom❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢❤❤
The fact that we would never have a father like Manager in the future hits me hard. He stood out among those coaches. Thank you Klopp. Hope and pray that you have a happy and successful life till the end.
Lads you’ve posted this 66 days too early lmao. Good prank though.. 😭
l
Listen man if you’re leaving Liverpool, but just please just do me a little favour. Will you win the last ever pl   for your last season of your life that we will all miss you you have to win the premier league. If you win the premier league the people at the Anfield to be a love you but we will miss you. We will definitely miss you a lot. Goodbye legend❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
You either die a Hero or live long enough to become a villain! And this man just knew when to stop.. and the genuine love and respect for the club is  commendable, even while he is leaving he is thinking for the future and the club that they can plan for the future and the way this has been informed to the fans, just wow! So responsible and sensible beyond! What a man.. What a legend! Just love and respect towards your decision! Wish you all the best, Gaffer!
How do you want to leave after you came to build a new history for the club? This is what I told everyone at the beginning, that you would come to make history like Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger. Now you want to leave the team after only 9 years? This is the history you made?
Its rare for a coach to get to leave on good terms leaveing only smiles behind !  There is a figure of speech in germany that goes like this : ``Wenn es am schönsten ist sollte man gehen``!
Great to see all different supporters from all clubs in the comments paying homage to a liverpool great❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Noooooo!!!!!!!
Klopp no man please there is no one better than you who can manage Liverpool 😭😭
THANK YOU! Thank you for everything, Jürgen. THANK YOU!  Nothing more needs to be said.
As a Spurs fan i wish him the best. The man is tired and stressed and has fulfilled his remit beyond any Liverpool fans expectations. For football generally i see his impact was largely positive. He is deeply protective of his club and what he basically created so i cant imagine how difficult this decision was for him. He has family so perhaps its time he thought about them for a bit.
Asante sana umetufanyia makubwa ninakutakia maisha marefu yenye mafanikio kutoka Mtwara Tanzania
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Klopp leaves Salah leaves Mourinho will arrive (hopefully and ruin it)
True legend 🙌..respect to him..wish him only the best in his future 👏
Dear Kloppo, YNWA❤
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
You will be missed jurgen,u brought us happiness thorough out the years,hope u find a good club to manage ❤
Thanks klop
only thing i hated about him was that he called unvaccinated players dangerous for the squad and stuff. That showed some evilness in him
To wrap it up: Jürgen thinks he's the normal one but everybody knows he is the special one. 😉❤️😘
Build him a statue! Club legend forever!
I'm among the tens of millions of supporters around the World that are going to miss you from this club (LFC) It's a thing that will surely happen at one point like you said, but I'm really sad to hear it now.
Easily one of the best managers in the history of English football. A great human being as well.
Man United should not let this opportunity slip..
Good luck to you Jürgen. I know I'm a blue but i quite like this guy he gets the city.
❤
I agree, next seaon we may see what the consequences for our best managers in my lifetime leaving has in store for Liverpool but this season ? it should definately put Liverpool in 'now or never' mentality and give 115 or even 1500% if its possible.
Much Love Jurgen, you have been immense, thank you for all you have done, and being a great dude
Masterpiece ❤❤ What a man ! Heartful speech ❤. Love klopp forever ❤
i cant believe this man
YNWA Klopp. ❤
I'm crying. Whew. Thank you, Juergen, for everything.
From a mostly neutral fan for EPL teams, I really hope they win the league now. Would be a proper story.
I’m a man utd fan, but I love this man loads..❤❤❤  Another thing is his 3 air punches, gets me every time ❤️❤️❤️ what a manager you are Klopp
For me, the best Liverpool manager that I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing. Thank you for all that you have brought to this amazing club, good luck with whatever venture you move onto next. you will never walk alone.
should rename the KOP stand KLOPP in his honour. just like kenny daglish
The greatest person ever.
Even im love this club even 2002  Sorry for everything i think LFC must be make sculptures in Anfield zone. Omg ilove this guys... Veryyyyyyy hurt to me.😭😭😭😭😭😭
Nationalmannschaft. Bitte Herr Klopp!
I’ve had a subconscious feeling this will be happening soon as Klopp is getting more frustrated on the sideline Manchester City who we all believe to have broken the rules to keep producing year after he must think it’s a lost cause, especially with how young our current team is. Thank you, Jurgen for ending 30 years of pain and completely taking the trajectory of a sleeping giant of a club back to where it should be. I’m gutted hearing this but I wish this man the best and hopefully, when he returns to management it’ll be somewhere like the German international job where it’s much less demanding and easier than the stresses he talks about in this video. All the best. YNWA
i didnt know how many times i write and delete and write again.. i dont know what to say.... hearing this.. its hard..really hard... want him to stay... but like what he had said .. its just feel unfair to him.. everybody deserve a chance to cherish their life while they can.. but still its hard hearing to this..saying thank you feels like saying goodbye right now...
😩😩😩
Go for alonso fast before others
Jürgen is our Rock ............. You got me feeling all kinds of feelings!
Thank you for everything good sir!🫶 You will NEVER walk alone
Endlich!❤️
Can honestly say their is no manager past or present that I’d of ever replaced Klopp with. He was the perfect manager for our club and made us a force in Football again without having the spending power behind him as City, Chelsea, United and even Arsenal.
I kloop we trust, superb manager, and yes he probably does need a break, but I see him at Madrid or Barca in the future. Just a thought. Let’s go win the lot this season please . Or just the prem will do❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏  thanks to jurgen the geeeerman
I'm a Man Utd fan and it's really hard not to like Jürgen. He's added so much value and injected unlimited amounts of enthusiasm to the Premier League. Good luck in all your future endeavours.
I’m going back to bed 😭
Unbelievable mentality unbelievable heart God be with you  in every single steps of yours kloop    You were a grace for the whole world football
Klopp is so likable, no wonders his players are willing to run to the ground for him. What an amazing coach. He is right, he is out of energy, and he wants to live a normal life, he deserves it cuz life is 2 short. Klopp I truly respect your decision, maybe after a year come to Barcelona please haha but seriously consider it.
Good luck in whatever you do next ,you were great for the prem and liverpool .Best manager in the world .from a cfc fan.
Tears just running… 😢 Jürgen is such a great human being, lives his values from day 1 of his career until today. I wish everybody could have a „Jürgen“ as a close friend. As a manager he is and always will be the GOAT, as a manager, coach and human being.
True legend ❤ynwa jurgen
Come come to sudia habibi 🇸🇦😇✋🏻 and grab mo salah wheth yuo

Let’s do as he says and not make this about him yet!! Let’s back the boys and get behind them and let them know we’re here!! We’ve got memories to make and trophy’s to add to his list!!!
Respect legend 👊👊👊  Thankss😊😊😊
🥲🥲🥲 as a Liverpool fan , I am crying
Such a fantastic manager and human being. Lifted the club and made people fall in love with football. Will be massively missed. If he ends up managing Germany, I’m supporting Germany. YNWA
Miss you klopp😢
Stay strong Liverpool fans. Klopp was by far the best manager at Liverpool and I can't express my emotions right now 😔 you'll be missed very much Klopp 🔥😭😔
And all the Kopites fan around the world loved you too! Thank you Jurgen Klopp for the jobs well done!
😢😢😢
I’m an Arsenal supporter I could truly say Klopp is a legend and I am truly going to miss seeing this man in the premier League and I can also see him going out on a high with a potential treble. As I’m watching this video I can see the Man is exhausted he definitely needs a break away from the game. Whoever Liverpool bringing next has very big shoes to fill
I've just found out 45 mins ago and I have to say I'm devastated and sat crying watching this but when he says that he wants to feel what a normal life is like you can fault the man and what a man he is YNWA ❤❤❤❤❤
Gary Neville to Liverpool lets go!💋
Dear lord, please with all of my heart I ask that you give Jurgen Norbert Klopp, a befitting parting gift.   It’s clear why he’s leaving , and that is - to leave the klopp in a good place, which is something he couldn’t do at dortmund and Mainz.   As heartbroken as it is, I’d like him to leave when the ovation is at its zenith; he deserves that much after everything he’s done for Liverpool.   Good luck with the future “Kloppo”, YNWA
❤
I'm gutted Klopp is leaving, guess all I can say is thank you.
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK THE JOY AFTER SO MANY YEARS  YNWA ❤️  WE WILL MISS YOU AMAZING MANAGER AMAZING PERSON
We Love you!
What a man! Yet another Liverpool  folklore. Wherever you go to Jurgen, you'll never walk alone.
Watching this interview was very difficult for me, being a lifelong  supporter of this great club. I'm 68 now, so I have been through the sad times of Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley departures. Jurgen Klopp brought LFC back to the forefront after some very mediocre seasons and although this sad news will be hard to take for a lot of our supporters, we have to show this man our love and respect for his decision. Sometimes us fans don't realise how much of a mental toll it takes on a manager, a player, or anyone associated with this great game because we love football so much. When it comes down to it, family and mental health are the most important things in life. I for one, wish him all the best in his life after Liverpool Football Club. Jurgen, remember and I'm sure you will, YNWA.
Keep hydrated football fans. Enjoy the unbelievable legacy he has made.  Loved by us scouse to many football fans world wide now lets see his next job wish him well and see who we get next snd wish them well and be behind them as we do. Love and light people pass the goodness forward its the scouse way
We’ve had Ole, Arteta, Lampard. It’s now time for Steven Gerrard
Once a red, always a red
Please please don't go
my boss my hero
We will always remember you ❤❤❤we the liverpooldians,we say 'ayekoo '
He is sign for Manchester United
Best manager in the world. And one of the best persons in pro football for sure. ❤
Jurgen, I understand and respect your decision…. You will leave with love of millions…. Be happy with your family…. Lots of love to your team
😢😢😢😢
That news has torn our hearts. As a Liverpool diehard, it is one of the saddest news I have heard early this new year. However, we respect your decision, dear Boss, and we are delighted and appreciative of your sense of humour, time, energy, brotherhood, optimism, creativity, and beyond all that the "LOVE" to the club, and Kops all over in addition to the football fans globally. We cannot stop thanking you, please, may the Almighty Allah accept all your endeavours, and bless your stay outside of Liverpool City, Anfield, and the Liverpool community all over the universe.  Asante sana.
Arsenal fan but I’m sad to hear he is leaving
I am so sad .my manager is leaving but don't take the normal life out of anyone  he actually needs to get some fresh air and enjoy the best of life after football.will mis you boss
united fan here, ynwa sir!
Nothing but respect for Klopp, to fight against the corrupt City and FA regime and WIN! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I wanted him take over from Wenger before he went to Liverpool. Wish him the best for the future and hopefully he manages Germany or fingers crossed, England national team.
Goodbye winning matches :(
you will be remembered in our hearts....... we will NEVER forget you sir Jürgen klopp you will never walk alone.....
Thank you Klopp❤
My best wishes for you,mister🙏🏻Liverpool for ever💪
I'll be telling my grandchildren that I was lucky to witness this great team thanks to you Jürgen , thank you for the great games it's been a pleasure thank you ❤️
Never thought this day would come :( Thank you boss!
Thank you for everything Klopp Best manager when it comes to passion and humbleness. No cheating, No crying. Just straight intelligence and skills. Thank you for amazing memories and changing so many of our lives
The only club that are happy right now are Manchester united and city
DE VA STA TED but I wish you the best Klopp...YNWA
Bye
We will miss jurgen Klopp we never saw him at a better place other than anfield . Liverpool was just right for him
Klopp will always be remembered for getting his new teeth at Liverpool
Godbless Klopp you truly deserve a rest and a normal life (the pressure of being an lfc manager must be immense) Thank you for your service to our club and our city you have made this proud city even more prouder.Thank you Jurgen ❤
If you love somebody set them free ❤️
All the best ❤️
waaaah my 14year ol son from Kenya got a shock with this news.........
He decided to leave last season
Absolute legend, from an Arsenal fan you will be missed!!
I'm a United fan. But I can say we understand the decision and the effect it has on you for which you have all our respect.
I remember when Sir Alex, my heart burst to tears. I can feel how much Liverpool fan are feeling right now. He is the one manager I wish United had. He is a genuine person, he gives his all and will be a great lost for the Premier League.
You can tell how emotionally invested he has always been with the team and the players, just by how big a hug he gives them. Not just a quick hug and pat on the back, but a REAL hug. If he could hug every fan like that I'm sure he would.
As a evertonian, I wish him the very best. You can see how hard this is for him to come out and say this with that hint of  vulnerability  behind his words. Probably thinking  about his personal wellbeing with the demands of doing it over and over and over again takes a massive toll on  one mental health and I can't imagine that pressure he had to face everyday from media and the public.   So deserve his time to enjoy his next chapter and bow out as an amazing man and an amazing manager.
You are the best. Thank you for everything. YWNA❤
❤❤
Love and respect this guy immensely can't Believe this last decade & how he's turned the club around with all they've achieved together. I still have his autobiography including the 2019 season, think I'll have to give it another read..
Crying. Love you. Respect for being honest! You gave it All !
the next one for german national team
He finally realised that football is just a game and not that important.
Don't break up with me, Jurgen...I love you 😢
I root for Chelsea, but I've always admired Klopp. His departure will be a significant loss to English football. He has contributed immensely to the sport.
He looks exhausted. This must have been a really hard decision for him.
💔💔💔
YNWA. Rename Kop as Klopp
I'll cherish that I was lucky to enjoy your managerial career at Liverpool. A Liverpool legend. You'll never walk alone.
Who knows ? maybe he will return in the future when he's ready, take your time Champ !!
He couldn't have explained everything better... If I was a Liverpool fan I'd be proud and content of my coach even at a goodbye or a see you later... I'm a Real Madrid fan but I've always appreciate it some much the amazing job Klopp do, for me it's undoubtedly a top class coach and I hope and desire to see him coaching Madrid some day..
100% behind you Klopp. Thank you for all the amazing memories. Best of luck in the next chapter of your life ❤YNWA❤
thank you for all good that already happened, for all memories 😘 and for what still is to happen. Wish you and your family all the best. Love you and YNWA Jürgen ❤
We need to win the PL and make a party in order to say... Thank for all! You're normal one, very very good person coach! Playing with this kind of coach you can do everything for him! We are going to win all the final! 👏Big thanks Mr Klopp!
He built a new house from the rubble of a broken one. Truly one of the best. ❤
Thankful and Im sooo love the Kloppostyle on and off the pitch! Lets make a awesome season!
I am Arsenal and Barcelona fan, but this man was absolutely fabulous in Liverpool and Borussia, Great manager! I love his attacking  philosophy!
United fan here, he was a true great
Thank you Klopp you made us believe again. Never Give up YNWA
Nooooooo😢😢😢😢😢😢 Liverpool will be struggling to get to top 6 again😢😢😢😢
For me Klopp is the best Coach Liverpool ever had imagine wining a EPL after 30 years
Unfortunately, the people of Liverpool today feel like the people of Dortmund did back then... when the last day comes it will be something extraordinary like in Mainz and Dortmund. Be strong, greetings from Germany
Loving these comments from other fans from other clubs xx love klopp im a liverpool fan, Klopp you brought the team back to the top and you will be missed you are a legend!!!
all my love for klopp yawl
Such a humble guy and an honest insight into his decision. I'm absolutely devastated like so many Liverpool fans across the world and I hope one day Klopp will be back at the club and the city of Liverpool in another role, if not manager. Thank you for everything Jurgen it's been an absolute blast and let's push you and the team on to win the quadruple.
Downfall is near for Reds
Feng you mister  Klop 😊❤
Klopp became manager of Mainz in 2001, so he has been working as a coach for 23 years. He has coached only three clubs in over 20 years!! And every time he left it was 100% his own decision. How rare is that, being a top football coach who has never been fired or asked to leave. He is a very rare human being. The real special one. ❤
Jurgen you're up there with The Beatles & The Mersey Sound & All Liverpool Football Clubs Fantastic History ... Thanks for always keeping us forevermore The Pride of Merseyside... Hero!
Kloop❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
당신의 앞날을 언제나 응원합니다
Big loss for Liverpool😢, big loss for P L.  Thank you Klopp❤💪
A great manager.great human being I hope u lifelong healthy life.u will never be forgotten. Passion. U show passion u got
Thanks for everything!!!  You are a model coach and a genuine person.  Good luck to you. YNWA
We all think Klopp is a superhero, but in reality he's just a regular guy who needs rest too. Sending blessings to Klopp.
Nothing Last for ever in this world
it's hard to keep doing things consistently year after year at the highest level as Klopp does.
Future England manager? 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🤔   We could do with a little "Rock n' roll" football with the class we've got!   Klopp = GOAT
UNFORTUNATELY HES ONLY REALIZING NOW THAT HE CANT COMPETE WITH PEP ANY LONGER. PEP IS A DIFFICULT MANAGER TO CONTEND WITH. HE’LL DRAIN YOUR ENERGY. I MEAN JUST IMAGINE! THREE TIMES IN A ROW HE WINS THE LEAGUE! AND YOU ARE A TOP MANAGER WATCHING ALL THIS! SURELY YOU’LL DRAINED.    WE UNDERSTAND KLOPP! YOUVE BEEN A GOOD COMPETITOR. FARE WELL!
Thank you for everything you done for the club from Liverpool Thai fan. Enjoy and do whatever you wanna do u always be our boss even someday you will become rival i will clap for u even win or lose i respect you very much and wish you happy forever
Thank you for everything Jurgen, Legend forever ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
One of the greatest managers in the premier league era. He’ll forever be remembered
Total respect for Klopp and his decision!
as a Man City supporter, it's really sad to see this Pep and Jurgen era ending like this
Best manager in the League. But for me much like Marcelo Bielsa it's more about the person than the actual football.  MOT YNWA
Thank God he is healthy, just tired and exhausted from a difficult job. Thank you very much Jurgen. Totally understand you cos we are the same age. The difference is you have a job that is 100 times more pressure than my job. You deserve to live the lifestyle you want to enjoy after the season. Skål Jurgen
Good luck enjoy you life Jürgen
In Klopp we trust
😢
You are irreplaceable! We will miss you SO much! YWNWA❤️
😭
ARSENAL SUPPORTER : FULL RESPECT TO WAY HE DONE THIS AND HUGE JOB WITH LIVERPOOL . ENJOY YOUR NORMAL LIFE LIKE YOU SAID Mr. KLOPP AND THANK YOU FOR BE IMPORTANT PERSONALITY OF PREMIERSHIP
respect from Holland, great coach!!
He is sir alex for Liverpool
Mr Liverpool ❤️
Best manager in the world ❤ thank you for everything Klopp
😢😢😢And I’m an Arsenal, Barca, Roma  fan and you make me love your style.  You pushed the limits of human beliefs and I can tell you’re loved even by them(maybe not all $€) but you touched our hearts with your truth and big smiles and I was looking forward for your interviews 😊. You found POSITIVES and spoke from the heart❤. Much love from Romania🇷🇴. The game will miss you🤙🏻YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE 🫶🏻
Bester Mann.
Thanks boss you are a legend. much appreciated. ynwa
1 year vacation then to England national team to win the world cup !!!!
respct klopp for what he did 🤝
I'm holding my tears right 😢
Thank you so much for along time you spend with us Untill the end let make good memmory
Xabi Alonso.
WHAT
I really hope Gerrard will be the new manager! Only one I can imagine replacing Kloppo... 💔
Klopp for Bundeskanzler... ne warte Präsident... ahh Trainer das wars 😅
Cchicken!!
As a Man Utd fan may I just say that Mr Klopp is an absolute legend 👏👏👏
Klopp needs to manage Germany . He won’t be betraying Liverpool if he manages a country but I think he just wants to retire and enjoy life with he’s family
Not since Shankly, Paisley and King Kenny has this kind of announcement been so hard to take/accept. He took us back to greatness and became a part of the very fabric of our club.  There will never be another.
Good news 😂😂😂
We will miss you klopp, you loved up to everything you said at your first interview. You made us from doubters to believers. We will never be able to replace you.. YNWA
personal reasons
โชคดีบอส
Thank you Jurgen
Sad announcement, but was to be expected. Before the Liverpool job ye planned to take a sabbatical, and didn't get the break he needed then. He'll either retire or take a long rest before any other jobs
I cried as an 9 year old when Kevin Keegan left I cried as an 22 year old when Kenny left and was gutted when Raffa left and some other amazing player too many to list here now at 56 years old I'm crying once more now Klopp is leaving God bless you Jurgen you will be missed YNWA
Thank you for everything boss 🥺💔
I have seen ever beautiful Liverpool's football last 7 years. The experience is big thing to me. Thank you for your dedication.  I hpoe we give good farewell for klopp.❤ It's up to us.
Heartbroken 💔, I wish him all the best x
💔💔💔
He wants to stay with his family. I think his daughter gave birth recently and he wants to enjoy the moments with his newphew.  So good luck for him and thanks for all the work you did for LFC!
In Klopp We Trust
Прошлом году мы сами хотели его уволить но тепер хотим чтобы он осталься навсегда здесь
It’s really difficult decision to accept as fan it really saddens me but all I would say thanks for everything kloop still remember the first day and  made me become from doubter to believer you give us everything I could dream of as fan hope he’s well and enjoy our final last ride  ynwa
I think this will improve the team this season as the team will play with more passion
I did Sense that something was off with Us  having this amazing form and things going Great,
Kloppen will always be Dortmund.
😢
Thank you for the memories. You brought so much joy to my life, so thank you.
YNWA
Thank You for everything Jurgen. Yes I'm devastated. It's like loosing a family member. I'm blessed that I'm part of this beautiful club and I watched you.❤
As a Liverpool fan I could never “like” this video no matter how much I love him lol heartbreak how do you replace this genius ?? And I support arsenal 😅
Thank you, Jürgen. You will always be in our hearts. ❤❤❤❤❤ God bless you and your family. YNWA.
Even as a Man United fan, I'm finding these news quite difficult! Will I be happy that Liverpool is going to struggle going forward, Yes!😅 But at the same time, I love this man and I know how difficult it is to lose a legendary manager, especially one that's revolutionized your club. It's actually going to be quite sad playing Liverpool going forward, without seeing Klopp's incredible reactions on the sideline.😂 Incredible manager, VERY difficult to replace and it's always difficult seeing a legend leave, especially when the world loves him! ... I guess he'll never walk alone, eh?🙄😂 You lot have been amazing at finding the right players, so maybe you'll succeed on finding a manager as well, but... we've been struggling for a decade now🥲 I wish him all the best and good luck on replacing this legend!
Jürgen Klopp, You Will Never Walk Alone
This man is the only man I look up to in football...
Disappointed 😢😢
Klopp Will be remembered as one of the best in LFC history. He is a great man, a great father figure in and out of the field. I very much like the respect and a good relationship he has with his players and supporters. What a great man, you can see truth, ingenuity, hard work,  respect and all the goodness through him. Klopp will be missed but we we have to respect his decision. GOOD LUCK Sir !!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Grief for us Liverpool supporters, relief for the rest of the Premier league, and yeh I accept the decision like everything he has said and all the decisions he has made over the years. So so sad.
Helped me a lot through the most difficult 10 years of my life. Incredible philosophy, perspective, and mentality. And the results that followed... Inspirational. Extremely sad day but more than well-earned. YNWA
He made us dream again and for that i thank him.
After 23 minutes of pouring his heart out , the interviewer says “ is that your message for the fans then “ …… grow up mate
devastated
Translation............ "I want some of the Saudi cake" 😂😂
Kloop has been outstanding and is one of the greatest Manager of all time He is very humble and very gifted  He is a great inspiration
He's going to Saudi.  Knew it!
Club is bigger than anyone. Xabi or zebri will recreate klopp game
thank you klopp,
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ah, man. This was shocking thing to hear. Klopp has brought glory back to Liverpool Football Club. The greatest manager ever. We love you forever, Jurgen. YNWA...
It is heartbreaking to the fans I will miss him, I think something has happened
Thank you Klopp! Just thank you.
Love you klopp❤❤❤
Didn't intend on having my heart broken today 😢 YNWA Klopp 🔴 ⚪️ ⚽️
😢, thank you 🎉❤
Arsenal supporter , he’s a legend , what a personality , great character and an unbelievable coach and man manager . I salute you JK 💪🏾💪🏾
Thank you so much, Master! Your legacy is truly great and inspirational. You inspire dreams!

믿고싶지않은 소식 ㅠㅠ

Best one
Thank you!
I fell in love with Liverpool because of you 😢..your football made me love every single minuit on the pitch...we wish you everything good in here on
Good luck Jurgen
Legend❤❤❤❤😢😢😢🌹🌹
Translates as..  “I’m sick of the club, fans and city”
I will miss him if he leaves the PL. He is a great coach and character. Good luck in your next adventure as long as it’s not against Arsenal 👍
2 year please  liverpool  need u
Jurgen what a shock!!!
This hurts man!
im a man utd fan wish the guy all the best he took liverpool to another level he aint paisley or shankley but he did good with limited funds
This is NOT what I wanted to wake up to 😭
All these scousers crying 😂😂😂
he looks so tired and exhausted
12 months off and hes coming to united top fella,
He’s really pushing on the Tränendrüse but it still picks me up.
It’s a sad day in Mersyside
This is end of the era.
Wow, devastating news for us but we wish you luck for your other steps in life, such a gentleman. I can't thank you properly for what you brought for us. You'll never walk alone❤
Ladies and gents we are looking at a manager who is on the verge of burning out and instead of ploughing on he’s brave enough to call it a day and walk away
I’m a Ajax supporter, but I’ve always liked Liverpool with Jürgen. Personally my favorite coach in the past years in the world of football. Everything he did he did with passion, love and dedication for football and Liverpool and that’s makes him one of the best coaches of all time. You deserve every kind of respect and your rest at the end of the season!
😖😖😫😫😭😭😭😭
Like the death of the queen and 9/11 I will always remember where I was when this news dropped.
Thank you for making us believe again Jurgen! Always a red ❤
BUILD THIS MAN A STATUE RIGHT FUCKING NOW
This is exactly like losing your father 😢😢😢😢😢
I've been a Liverpool fan my whole life Thank You for reminding the world of our legendary status
"It's not important what people think when you come in but what they think when you leave." Jürgen, you are a legend, that's what I think!
So sad......😂😂😂. Hey Klopp, god save the king mate....😂😂😂
YNWA❤
He put Liverpool back where it always deserved to be, you can't explain Klopp's history without mentioning Liverpool and viceversa, he did amazing and truly incredible things for the club, thankyou for everything, its been an unbelievable journey
💔  You will always be a legend Jurgen. More importantly, you will always be our legend.  Someone build this man a statue already
Thank you Jurgen
Very sad to hear but if it is affecting your life in the world outside of football that could wear you down it is the best decision for you. Final push for the upcoming months lads all the best ynwa.
Jetzt schon eine Legende
Audi s5 v8 manual looking great value  atm.. look for full main dealer history and low owners £10k buys a good example
Thanks for everything... But we still have alot to play for this season... We go again YNWA
Overall, he is to me by way the best manager in football worldwide. Strategist, empathetic, open minded, respectful, authentic , entertaining, seeing the bigger picture in politics, positive, .... I say that as Bayern supporter
He feels he’s done what he can. Wonder if the player’s knew.
baca waiting 💙💙❤❤
Newcastle fan here for me he is the best maneger in England and what a tactical genius I don't like his stance on the vaccine but when he has done for Liverpool magic
jurgen always will be remembered
There is nothing he did not do for this club. Huge madrid fan here but Klopps liverpool has a special place in my heart. Thank you Klopp. Jürgen Klopp.
Your honesty and integrity says it all you will be missed by all of Liverpool and the premier League and all the fans including me. Thanks Jürgen and let's go out with a bang and get more trophies before you go.  One more thing get that man a statue has one of the Liverpool legends up there with the best of the best. YWNWA .
This is why Sir Alex Ferguson was the greatest and will always be the greatest of all time.
This is truly surprising news. And this is very sad. I can't say any more. Just Sad.😢😭
As a football fan I'm gutted, one of the Premiership's all time characters.
Jurgen, 48 years supporting this wonderful Club.  Our respect and admiration for you as a manager and a person cannot be conveyed. You have our hearts and our thanks for all the wonderful memories, for letting us dream again and for securing our future. From Cape Town “We love you “ and will support you wherever you go YNWA
YNWA JURGEN❤
Give the guy the quadruple and give him a proper send off LEGEND!!!!
Fans all over the world love klopp I’m a RMA fan ❤
Respect for the work! Today I am a little sad, liverpool loose a Great one, the league too. Who can disrespect the man? I wish him the best, and sad for liverpool fans... (A United supporter)
No... NO.
Its gonna be important to take the time to medited all that man achieved in 9 years❤
YNWA
Thks for everything We'll mis you . I am sad to hear this , but I understand .
Klopp & Mourinho (Porto /Inter) are the best managers in the world. They made players better, Clubs better. Didn't have unlimited transfer budgets, but shear passion and vision for the game. Pep would have quit in a year's time if he didn't have money to buy best players.  End of a magnificent era. 🙏  From a Chelsea fan
Heartbreaking. I’m gutted. You gave me some of the best days of my life. We’ll miss you Jurgen. I’m so glad you’re a red. YNWA.
Salute to Klopp from a City fan. I'm honestly at a loss for words he's leaving. He made Liverpool a force again, will be missed no doubt. Again salute
ITS JUST 26 DAYS INTO 2024 AND THIS???
😢
💔💔💔💔💔
The king is dead ... Long live the king... Ynwa jurgen
Thank you for everything Klopp, "you'll never walk alone".
Jürgen Klopp. My hero! I will miss you. What a fantastic job you have done with the club! I don't know how anyone can top that. ❤ Thank you for everything!
Barcelona is waiting for U Jurgen
Get the statue ready
Another statue at anfield is a definite  We love you  You will always be loved by our club and supporters for endless years to come  Jurgen you are Liverpool
This is very very sad to hear but what a wonderful job he has done for our beloved club . But we all knew this time would come  and as much as we do not like what is coming we must thank the BOSS for all the hard work he has put into the club  Myself l wish him all the best on what ever he does if it is retirement or what ever  From  myself and the many millions of supporters of LIVERPOOL we thank you  and he will always in our hearts
Am so disappointed as a fan of lfc, I always knew that as long as u are there as our manager, we are sure to win everything possible,  right now my hopes are shattered for the future of our club......how I wish u could just stay and change your mind..just be in the club please. 😢😢😢
Michael Edwards left now Klopp wats going on
My question is, when you quit will Liverpool remain the same? Actually am not happy
What a shock
Time really flew by didn't it. It's been almost a decade! I'm disappointed we won't be seeing Klopps football here in the future, but I gotta say I'm not so surprised. I'm surprised he renewed the last contract. He gave 110% and his first team burnt itself out on the field 2 seasons ago. I'm thankful he still had enough to give us a new team to go on with. Danke.
STEVIE IN?!?!?!
A Chelsea fan here in Kenya but common, this Man makes the premier league interesting
😢❤
Thank you Jurgen❤️🙏 best manager at LFC while I’ve watched football, it’s been a privilege… good luck for the future 🙏 Let’s finish this season off with a bang🔥💯
2.0 for?!?!
He's going to end up in Saudi!  Can't complain though really. Made the team over perform most of the time he was there. Thanks for the memories Jürgen. You will be missed by the fans
UP THE BLUES!!!!
Jürgen, you're talking about all the things you owe to the club and the city, you owe nothing. Think about yourself, look after yourself. Legend forever! ❤❤❤
I recently watched the ""Beckham "" documentary,,and  he said almost same thing,,tired,, exhausted,,run over by a bus syndrome...It comes to us all.. Fantastic video.👍💯👍
...this is like the old tale of the "keeper" in charge of a huge powerfull monster called "wisdom"; learnt by heart all the beast's whims and wishes, how he must approach and how touch him, when is dangerous and tame, and why; learns his language too--what sounds he usually makes at what, and what sounds uttered by another creature quiets him and what infuriates him.The keeper learn this lessons perfectly in the course of time by living with him, and calls it wisdom. He knows nothing in truth about these resolutions or whims of the multitude, wether any of them is beautiful or ugly, just or unjust, but gives a name to each according to the monster's opinion, calling beautiful what pleases the monster and evil what annoys him. There's no other principle in this, but calls necessities just and beautifull; and how really different by nature necessity is from good he has neer seeing it for himself and is unable to teach another... My point is, that is no easy with that much pressure at that level to impart good ruling... HopeFor jhurgen Kloope to try to make the last effor or least to coach the liverpool for something big!; even with the pretentious ressolutions of this year or without it...
As a Dortmund fan, I will never forget what he did for us and for Liverpool. I hope he stays successful.
Salah is next
I was in tears and on my knees hearing This you made All the Liverpool players the stars they are now their moves and Play everything you have made Them that and signing van dijk salah mane the whole lot No one belived they Will be good because of you everyone in the world is talking about these superstars now so thank you for maling This club one of the best and Where ever you go always remeber you,ll never walk alone Jürgen i dont Think any manager Can do it as good as you did i Will miss you we All Will lets win the trophy,s like the carabao cup and premier leauge and All the other ones one last time before you leave you deserve glory and the trophy,s before you go Make your goodbye a season to remeber i know you Can do it we know you Can do it enjoy your last season Jürgen one final YNWA hope the future goes your Way ❤😭❤️🤍🔴⚪️
😱😭😭😥😪😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😪😪😪😪😪😪
As a united fan, Klopp is a class act and will be missed by both LFC and the premier league. YNWA Klopp ❤
Hi i am korean liverpool supporter Klopp, you have been with us in many ways as a support for our team in difficult times and in good moments. In particular, my relationship with the Reds was incomparably better than any other manager, and I’m sorry that I can‘t see your tactics and ceremony at Liverpool Anfield. I‘m sorry to let you go, but if there’s a meeting, there‘s a breakup. Your achievements, your trophies, your achievements, you can get in your way, but it‘s really hard to get someone to leave you. I hope you have a good path forward. Thank you! You will never walk alone!
Bwahahhahahahah …..
Klopp is a legend manager and a top bloke. The Premiership has been blessed to have him. I feel sorry for the Liverpool fans. Klopp will be missed.
Legend YNWA Jurgen
Made me cry. Devastated.
YNWA
Remember seeing his Dortmund team and wishing we could replicate their football… 8-9 years later and some of the best ever memories as a 45 year old Liverpool fan. We were (are) so lucky to have him as our manager. Thank you Jurgen!!!
No matter what happens, Klopp made us believers. The man is a legend, up there with Shankly and Paisley. He deserves this decision, though I thought he would see out his contract. There is also nothing to stop him from returning to be Liverpool boss when called upon in years to come. YNWA JURGEN KLOPP. THANK YOU FOR THE MEMORIES
Klopp!! What a man!! This man single handedly came in a declining phase of Liverpool and made the team great again. And to do it against a city team that was funded so handsomely, with one of the greatest manager of our generation pep making the pl look like a farmer's league. Damn! Thankyou jurgen not only for the trophies but for the moments that made us liverpool fans believe in our players, bringing the best out of all our players. I cannot replace any of the player from the squad even if i wanted to, they literally fit perfectly for their role in the team. Man that's Jurgen for you! Thankyou gaffer i hope you get what ever you want to do cause you deserve it. YNWA!❤❤❤
Love ya jurgen mate.
As a City fan this bring me no joy. I love Klopp hes a class act and a tactical genius. LFC will win the premier league this year as a going away gift. The battles LFC and MCFC have had in recent years were epic. But City will win champions league again 🩵 Godspeed Jurgen
YNWA! Thanks for show me how football can be. Good rest Klopp!
Only love and respect for one of the greatest human being there ever will be..Danke Jurgen.
this is very sad.. hmmm😥
Giving the fans total respect by speaking to them like this  , well done 👍
14:00 this is sooo good. Have a good life time Jürgen :)
残された時間は短いけど、頑張れユルゲン
After all this yers, I think we all can say, you are not the Normal One Jurgen, you are the Only One. YNWA
That's a man who needs a long rest
❤ nobody can replace Klopp 😢
Ffs. This made me really emotional and I'm not even a Liverpool supporter! He's way more than a football manager. He has a sage like quality about him.
Made me a LFC fan, top man! YNWA
We will have a moment with the premier league trophy around the city
a man of honour … god bless him
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
He's a great manager, he has battled match fixing which they want him to do, but he has refused and this is great, I wish other managers can be like him, I wish him all the best
Im a city fan and even though Liverpool are rivals I respect them as a team and I definitely highly respect Klopp! 🫡
He's off to Al-Eti-kerching next season
From doubters to believers.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
is he ill? such a strange sentence to use "running out of energy"
This shows you the superiority of sir Alex Ferguson. Klopp is burnt out after 8 years and is tired. Fergie did 27 years and only retired once he established united as the biggest club in the country. That longevity and also success is unmatched and shows why fergie is the GOAT.
😭
Please don't leave boss 🥺😭😭
クロップ監督、大好きでした 長年リヴァプールを支えてくださりありがとうございます。 このシーズンは絶対に優勝してください。
Best German 🇩🇪 import into Premier league. You have made the league better. Your team better and you have grown into an icon whilst being here. You are special Jurgen and I thank you for what you have done for English football ❤❤. From a Millwall fan in London. God bless
Thank you Mr Normal Klopp
최고의 감독 동양에사는 내가 리버풀이라는 축구클럽을 사랑하게 해준 감독 항상 그리울 겁니다 보스
Legend
the klopster brought joy back to watching liverpool. it ended at heysel, he brought it back (ok there were some moments with torres and suarez, but mostly, it ended with heartbreak). but this man of faith ... gave a generation of liverpool fans hope, joy and celebration. YNWA!
💔
Benitez.. hogdson.. rogders..  And now klopp.   Heh. I am getting old. I hope klopp can finally enjoy his life... he gave whatever i hope for this club anyway.   I really hope that he can give an insight about who will be in the future but all in all.. Let's have fun..
❤️‍🩹
As an Arsenal fan um crying I love this man the Premier league won't be the same without him
Sorry to hear he leaving but he left us in a better place and good luck to him for the future 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Don’t be sad it’s over,  Be grateful it happened   I live this man more than my own father thank you for everything gaffa
Something happened, he is not saying.  This is  very suspect
I am a german guy... But i love Klopp @liverpool... It's a one of a kind relation... Sad that it'll be over but i appreciate how he explained it... And i am convinced he'll giv 200% until the last game. ❤
Ran out of excuses I guess 😂😂
It's hurt, but respect your decision. Thank you for everything and... You'll Never Walk Alone ❤
💔💔💔😔
Klopp stepping down? There is nothing to be sad about. You have created a strong, world-class Liverpool. Your achievements are a treasure that will never be forgotten by soccer fans around the world. Instead of being sad, I would like to say thank you with a smile. I am only one soccer fan in the world, but your passion for soccer has saved my life many times. I could continue to love soccer because of Jürgen who always showed me the exciting game. And Liverpool will continue to be such a team. Thank you Jurgen. You will always be my hope, YNWA, from Japan. 🇯🇵
Oh God, Here we go again…🧔🏻‍♂️✊🏻
Big loss for all of football. Leaving the biggest shoes to fill at Liverpool going forward. Assembled a great team with a great spirit. We're missing you already!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO😭😭😭
He gives 100% every single day, devoted 8 years of his life to Liverpool and now he wants to enjoy life outside of football, it’s sad to watch him go but he will always be remembered as a Liverpool legend
One of the Best mangers in our History.
Thank you 😊 Klopp  love you 😍  You never walk alone 🎉
Amazing hero for us always will be ❤
please dont leave liverpool .....we all love you Jorgen ❤
YNWA ❤ We will always love you Jürgen!
Saudi's had a sniff of this news and offered Steven G, a new contract
Thank you my boss. Thanks for everything, i will not forget all the thing you bring to Liverpool. Thanks❤
Jürgen
Let's win the league for Klopp!!
There is no point everything is perfect everyone loves him he is doing everything amazing
Thank you boss. We'll miss you. YNWA❤
We're all with you Jurgen, no matter what! Thank you for absolutely everything, and here's to a succsessful final season! YNWA
I'm obviously sad that it's ending, but I'm happy that it happened.   You won everything there was to win for us. That's all I could've asked for. o7
I am sobbing the whole clip..  Am  really gutted.  But I try to understand.   Thank you Jurgen, you deserve every good things in life.   A Liverpool fan in Indonesia here, fan club member since mid 1990s.  I am at a loss for words, beside thank you. Thank you for everything  You"ll never walk alone
Be the manager until you are 70 years
I am a Man Utd fan but I respect this guy Morden era legend him an pep the new wenger Ferguson maximum respect. But @liverpoolfc 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Jurgen has given his ALL during these 10 years and given us so much happiness, success and most of all restored pride. He ABSOLUTELY deserves a long, long break and spend it with his family. Will of course miss him, but understand his motives. All we know is that HE WILL NEVER WALK ALONE!
We will always love klopp ❤
Thank you
Respect Jürgen. Hope could enjoy a „normal life“. You really deserved it. ❤
Man this is devastating for us as fans and for players I can't believe this, we will not win anything 😢
I am not following football for many years I remember it was 2017 when I first saw Salah and klopp style of playing For them I became a fan of liverpool There were lots of ups and downs but I can't stop loving the team and specially klopp  His energy,fist pump man how can I forget U are a legend and I will always support u klopp❤
Something definitely bothering him,  Looks and sounds mentally drained I think he needs a bit of support, something not right, as an Everton fan    I secretly think you are great, all the best Mr,Klopp
I'm gonna cry for a week 🥲🥲😓
The way he is leaving the club shows how unique he is. Thanks Klopp for all the emotions you gave us ! Thanks
안돼ㅐㅐㅐㅐ😢
Klopps next job at McDonalds he wants a normal life then thats a normal job
Took the club to being pound for pound the best in the world… unbelievable manager both in results and humility 🐐🫡
you will be missed boss ):
It’s so sad he’s leaving i’m about to cry over it
PLEASE STAY
😢
Its very sad to hear this but we are now looking at players to bring the trophy for Klopp
I hate that I’m watching this 💔from the bottom of my very being, thank you for the memories you’ve given me, Jurgen.
Wow just wow
Hara gedirsən ay baba🥹
Great memories mate, thanks for everything 😊
The greatest Liverpool manager of my lifetime. Lets not be sad we've lost him, lets be thankful we had him! THANK YOU JURGEN <3
Come to West Ham next Jurgen, we want a Champions League Trophy !
We love you Boss  YNWA ❤
You can’t fill his shoes
Oh Klopp come on be Lfc manager till the end
Fantastic manager. Brought Liverpool to the top but this is the end of an era they won't be challenging for the top honours for a few seasons now.
Only suitor for  your successor is xabi alanso
To rename the Kop tribune to Klopp 😎👍
최고의 감독이자 존경하고싶은 한 인간입니다. 리버풀을 이끌어주셔서 정말 너무너무 감사합니다…!!! 언젠가 다시 보겠죠?
🥺
😢
You can see on the sidelines he doesn’t have the energy anymore
Thank you boss. YNWA❤️
The Boss already hinted last season there would be a day when he would step down to start a "normal life". As much as I'm shocked and saddened, I recognise that even mega stars need a break. Jurgen has earned that right without a doubt. Let's focus on the now, get them points in the bag and win it for Jurgen! Let's go LFC ❤
As a city fan...this guy is absolutely lovable guy the best manage in the pl at the moment after pep.....this guy has given me many nightmares throughout his time at Liverpool ....Jurgen klopp is an absolute legend not only for liverpool but for the premier league as well top guy🔥🔥🔥
He wants to join a big club like Man City
I'm not crying...you are. The most passionate manager ever. Thank you Jurgen Klopp.
German culture has a deep sense of philosophy and spirituality. Tuchel practices Ayurveda, Klopp needs to find himself and start going to bed late and waking up at 1pm having lazy days. Good on ya klopp 💅🏻
The last dance begins.  Very Sad but I wish Klopp all the best now and after the season is over. YNWA 💯✊🏿
I knew that this day would come someday. I have nothing but immense gratitude for my man. May he live a happy and healthy life.
legend
❤ I have a feeling Klopp might return after resting.
😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am a normal Man but not Living a Normal Life!     So sad as football means so much to so many people now!
You're the greatest and my motivation Jürgen..love from Nepal..die hard Liverpool fan..but I'm crying listening to you
I’m inconsolable right now, gutted! Greatest Manager ever, thank you for bringing so much success to our club. You’re a legend and you will forever live in our hearts ❤ Cheers to your next challenges!
Above all an incredible person. Enjoy life Jurgen you've earnt it ! Thanks for the amazing memories (hopefully a few more before you go).
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's not you Klopp it's me. Where's  Stevie  G then ?
Nooo pleaseeee😭😭😭 One of the reasons why the premier league is entertaining is because of you 😭
Klopp we will truly miss you and the great success you gave us. One of the greatest managers for us and truly lead the team. Thanks for everything and you are truly a legend of the club. We will support you.
gorgen klop we miss you 😢
What can I say about this it's just a heartbreaking 💔, of course we'll miss him, but I hope only the best for him, he was a legend,  a source of inspiration and dreaming for Us 🙏♾️♥️
Danke Jurgen for the years. We all will never forget what you are doing the LFC over the years. You will be ever have a place in our hearts! YNWA!
Oh, Jürgen. We shall all miss you. You changed us from doubters to believers. Good luck in whatever you do in the future. You’ll Never Walk Alone 🔴🇩🇪
He will probably win the title this season, the players will give more than everything.
Im a man utd fan. Just remember liverpool supporters. Without a manager your still better than us with eric ten haag.  Hate to say it but klopp is bloody outstanding. Fair play. Well done and good luck from now.
Not just Liverpool but the premier league is losing a diamond in world football.
I will miss klopp, he is a fine fine person and manager! //United supporter
Elite manager, even better person.  My god will we miss him
WIN EVERYTHING LADS FOR JURGEN FOR THE BOSS FOR HIM
I didn't like that sports car Analogy. Made me a bite sad. But basically, saying that at his age, he could still run with best best. But because he is all in with Liverpool. He can see other parts of his life slow coming to an end. Which is understandable. He probably wants more time with his wife, kids, and grandkids while he can still go all in. Thank you, Jurgen. You will be missed. YNWA.
I believe there are different kind of ways to manage with the same results. He might manage with less energy definitely. Probably needs to convince him. Who knows, hopefully he might change his mind in a few months
Jurgen Klopp is a genuine person and a good person. Listening to him makes you love him more and more. Have a Blessed life ahead Jurgen Klopp
Alhamdulillah ada translate bahasa indonesianya,, taoi sedih juga bakal ditinggal klop, taut liverpool terpuruk lagi dan aku jadi bahan bully fans lain
Thank you for everything boss ❤
I am not a football fan but a fan of Jürgen Klopp. Great manager und even more a great human, which he shows again in this interview. All the best for his sabbatical, I am shure, we will see hin again on the sideline - maybe back here in Germany ❤
Even his scheduled exit is highly professional, an honest and true guy, not many like him if any...
I respect the honesty
This is a sad day for  me right know very sad
Let get the trophies tribute to Jurgen Klopp before he leave end of this season. Wish that he can stay in Liverpool forever but we all know Jurgen will leave at some point. Forget about bad time, remember the good time under Jurgen Klopp will be in our heart( Liverpool FC) Forever. We thanks you  and your team for the hard w during past 10 years. You'll never walk alone✌
He is my Shankly, I'm 40yrs old & hearing this I had to hold in my emotions. Klopp is liverpool. He is Anfield, already missing him. Devastated news, let's mow on get this quad. Only assurance I have left today...
من 56 سالمه، تهران زندگی می کنم. من طرفدار لیورپول هستم از زمان قهرمانی چمپیونز 1-0 مقابل رئال مادرید و بودن بخشی از آنفیلد تنها دلخوشی من توی تمام این سال ها بود و با یورگن کلوپ این سالها بهترین لحظاتم رو داشتم و حالا این خبرکه منو شوکه کرد ... هنوزم باورم نمی شه ... خیلی خیلی خیلی غمگینم ... خیلی ... اصلا حالم خوب نیست ....
The BEST!  I am going to miss Klopp, his approach, his leadership, his personality, and the team success.  Let's kick on and win the league this year as an appropriate send-off to the gaffer!
Thank you Jurgen, Danke Jurgen  It hurts so bad after all you have done in turning us "from doubters to believers".  Take care of yourself and enjoy life
i love you Jurgen. You haven't left and I'm already starting to miss you
He will be forever a red,now and forever.
As a Man Utd fan i have loved watching your passion and determination over the years. You are such a big personality Jurgen the premiership will be a lesser spectacle without you. I wish you and your family all the best and hope to see you back here sometime in the future.
Worst Friday for a long time, this has ruined my weekend, Klopp has been the greatest thing to happen to Liverpool in the 20 odd years I've been a fan, genuine heartbreak 💔 that he's leaving but I wish him all the best with all my heart, you made us believers Jurgen and you will always be a red, I hope to see him managing again because he's a massive loss for football. YNWA Jurgen and thankyou ❤️
Most LFC supporters have probably knew this day would unfortunately come, as sad as it is it's been a remarkable journey and I wish him all the best for whatever he may choose to do with his life from here. He will be always remembered as the one who finally got us a premier league title and his success is right there with all the other great managers we've had. Vielen dank Jurgen, Vielen Vielen dank !!!!!!
I'm a Leeds fan, but love this guy, how his team plays and his enthusiasm. When he joined Liverpool he said it's not what they say when you join that matters, it's what they say when you leave. He will know how much he is loved by Liverpool and unbiased football fans
This guy made me cry
Hut ab Herr Klopp
He's an example of an individual, he appreciated the fact the club believed in him even after a really bad season, and the way he repaid them was by focusing on building a successful team that is most likely going to win the league this season before he even thought about himself. You cant hate this man.
The upmost respect for this man for doing this interview. He could've just let rumors fly for the rest of the campaign but he comes out and faces it head on. Just like his football style. YNWA Jurgen! DANKE! Go enjoy life. You more than deserve it. Cmon Reds!! Bring the world cup back to Germany Jurgen!!
Please tell me I'm dreaming bad 😢😢
Class manager ,all the best JK from a West Ham fan
Every game at Anfield now until the end of the season will be more than just a game. A farewell full of emotions ❤❤
the squad better retain the RED-HOT FORM they are in (in all competitions) to give the gaffer a TROPHY-LADEN GOODBYE. love you man
"I am still a normal guy, I just haven´t lived a normal life for too long now" It´s incredible how so much people would like to be in his position, but the excessive workload affects even the most dedicated individuals. My respect for Klopp, I hope he finds a way to live the life he desires to the fullest.
I've always thought we owe Ulla and the kids for taking away Jurgen's time... totally disregard how the gaffer felts about it because it seems like he's at home. I thank you for your honesty and while we'd like another decade with you, the memories were unforgettable!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What’s there to say really? U spoke the truth Jurgen and made the right decision for you and all of us fans, team and owners. One has to go hard and when you can’t do it anymore it is time. You should be proud of not only what you’ve achieved but also this decision. The man in the mirror is well informed and he told you this. Thankful for all you did for the club and us as fans. Enjoy the rest of the
Klopp to Egypt national team
I'm gonna dare to say this, but Juergens energy suffering is because of the overly busy schedule with a million competitions squeezed into shorter time frames. Success and maintaining it as well. The underestimation of maintaining a certain level is a big one. You see sort of a decline in temprament and some of his loveable characteristics right after COVID hit and the schedules got tighter, the screens became more important, etc. I know Juergen, the type of mind set and person he is, I grew up a few hours from his roots. We value consciencousness and he's obviously doing the right thing at the right time the best he can and MOST IMPORTANTLY he's staying true to what he is and believes.
In the whole liverpool history no one has so much charisma and brought so much joy than Klopp...he is the embodiment of modern day Shankley....not sure if anyone can replace his shoe..exceptional character and excellent human...we will miss you brother
감사합니다
😭
We will miss you. I'll never be the same :(
Hell be back
Awu bozza kunzima . We understand but its sad to accept
Sir Klopp you love Liverpool with your whole heart♥️♥️♥️  But the owners of the Club let you down let us down as fans... it's difficult to win the League with the Youth as a core of the first team
Thank you legend
Shame, God bless you and your family ❤
😢😢😢
As a United fan this made me cry. Jurgen came as a manager and he will leave the club like a legend. Intelligent man with a great personality. We can right a book for him.
I'm not even a Liverpool supporter and this hit me in the feels. He'll dearly be missed in the Prem - that's for sure
NOOOOOOOOO
Best Manager in my opinion. Im sad to hear you leaving, especially because im a Liverpool fan, but if u chose that way i won't say a thing. Have a good life Jürgen Klopp!❤
the premier league will not be the same after this.good luck to klopp on his next chapter 💔
I respect your decision. Whatever you do, I will always support you. You have always been our best manager and will never change. ❤
As a newcastle fan ...what a fantastic man klopp was and is ..the premiere league was way better for him ..a true proletariat
dont leave please
😢😢
Legend !
Darwin Nunez effect 😶
Jurgen Klopp left Liverpool behind. What do you want from this stingy owner. PSG out😅😅😅
MY HEART JUST BROKE. I am shattered Jurgen. MY HEART JUST BROKE...Then I listened to what you had to say...I understand. Love you Jurgen and THANK YOU. WE WILL NEVER WALK ALONE. Have a good life.
Jürgen Klopp, the most special normal one ❤❤❤❤❤
Sad news, but understandable! Thank you so much for the amazing memories Jurgen. How far and ahead you took our club, with your passion, honesty, knowledge, and hard work. You will forever be a legend of the club. YNWA ❤️
Barcelona is the most beautiful place Mr Klopp
Respect. Whatever the reason is just rest boss, enjoy your retirement spend time with family.
💔💔💔😢
"I will never ever x3 manage another club in England other than Liverpool".
as long as I perdicted liverpool will sell Salah, but I'm really in shock that they let Jurgen Klopp leave, he isn't leaving I'm sure about that. he is forced to be left, because and that is something very obvious the club has no intentions to invest in the football team and actually willing to sell key players like sallah and I won't be surprised if they even sell Dijk. they are the cheapest management club I have ever seen, and I'm really thankful I'm not this club supporter, I'm certain he did discussed with them keeping Salah and also why not try with Kylian Mbappe, but they are cheap. because Liverpool isn't small club they had chance to talk with Mbappe if they are really willing to do. I wish you good luck Jurgen with club you deserve.
I think this is a very good time to announce this decision. What would be the alternative? Spending energy to keep this quiet? Now this energy is free, also in the team, and can be used to win all the remaining titles.
My heart is broken.
Piers Morgan is fuming.
No, I love liverpool because of you😢
❤😢
I am heartbroken, but thankful for everything Jurgen has given. YNWA.
Nooooo! 😭😭😭😭
Incoming Xabi letts go 😊
i can only see him managing the German national team in the future.
😢😢😢😢😢
Today is the day when the entire Liverpool F.C world is in shock. I admire your passion, love and the bond you have made with this club. We love you Jurgen 😔 .Y.N.W.A
LFC will close the season on a high.    YNWA.
this man like a vaksin to problematic club,,in 2015 liverpool in very bad condition he repair this club and polish it,thank you kloop
"I'm still a normal guy but I don't live a normal life for too long now" you deserve had a normal life now, thank you for everything that you could bring us especially for me as a Liverpool fans since 2005. How you teach and inspired us that everythings is possible if you believe and willing to work for it.  "From Doubters to Believers" You'll Never Walk Alone Klopp, truly legend 😢
Klopp needs to take a break but I need Klopp at Liverpool...yes, it sounds very selfish, but I feel that without Klopp Liverpool will lose some of its brilliance, there were bad times and good times but always trust Klopp😢
The Premiership is losing a Titan. Excellent manager and people motivator. A Gooner, but I have nothing but respect for him. Will miss the battles but will not miss the many beatings! Hopefully we can gove you a heated reception at the Emirates. You will not want or expect anything else. A true warrior!
How I wish I could take a picture with him and autograph now to remember the wonderful time he has given to this club, his passion, his love is pure
I hope Slippy G gets the job, he did so well at Villa! LOL
He is just a legend. Loved him at BVB, loved him at Liverpool. Hopefully he will comeback someday at take over Real Madrid :)
Salah and van djck to Saudi then
I've never enjoyed watching a team more than Klopp's Liverpool. Trophies only tell part of the story; the memories last a lifetime. How can you put the Barca game into words? The definition of charisma in the dictionary shows a picture of Jurgen Klopp.
I LOVE U
Why does this all make me feel emotional ? We respect you boss You take your well deserved break from football you’ve earnt it we love you in spirit and in heart
Kloop we all love you and wish you well ,thankyou for everything you have put into helping bring our club back to the top where we belong you'll never be forgotten YNWA❤
I want the club to name the new stand “Sir Klopp Stand”.  Thats the least we can do to repay what he has done for the club.
I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad.....
Get big Ange . Don’t let Gerrard near our club
I am a Mainz 05 fan and I feel so sorry for Liverpool. I know what you feel.
🥲🥲
Numb, that’s all I got for today….I understand you have to be 100 all the time and all I can do is thank this incredible man for everything he gave our club and the City of Liverpool… Few months left yet so imma soak every last moment in Thank you JK
Ohhhhh myyyyyyy goddddd Klopp. The next best candidate is Xabi Alonso. Need to prise him away from Bayer now...
Any true lover of the Premier League and English Club football in general owes this man a vast hug and a colossal thank you. What a legend, i really hope hes not away from football and the Premier League but he's already cemented himself as a legend so i could understand if the break is permanent. I dont think it will be though, 6-24 months. Mad respect and loads of love man
Just sad!
Jurgen Klopp ❤
One of the greatest managers in modern football and a special human being. Thank you for everything you have given and brought to the lives of us Liverpool fans. ❤
6 trophies to peps 16  nuff said I think
He put Liverpool before himself. It hurts but what a journey and probably the best manager since Paisley.  All the best Jurgen ❤️
From a Newcastle fan: Respect.
JÜRGEN KLOPP as a Liverpool fan I love you to death and I respect your decision all good wishes for your future LEGEND
It's obvious he's been enticed to take the vacant Republic of Ireland managerial position, lol
The great man! Many thanks for the outstanding work! Forever in my heart and in my memory. Thank you for all years, Jurgen!  Some players may have playing time, some may not, but this "player" is in the game almost in every match every year! He gave us  all so much passion.  P.S. The team just have to win all the competitions we participate in. The greatest gift for the greatest manager.
after a year he will coach bayern
Come to Barcelona sir
We will miss him. A special manager. Really changed my point of life, making believe in myself.
Überraschend...aber absolut nachvollziehbar.  Dann lass uns die Saison grandios beenden
What a man 😢 all the best Jürgen
You newer walk alone jurgen
Thank you Gaffer for your promise and passion brought back into our football style, all the best deserves his rest.
Pls don’t leave
Klopp revived my passion for Liverpool. It was always there, but having followed the team since 1989, Klopp brought back excitement I hadn't felt since my teenage supporter days. He will be deeply missed
He is absolutely right! He is leaving the club at his best and in good terms. He needs to recharge, focus on family, and think about his mental health. He will probably be in Bayern in three years.
I’m so sad
I'm gonna wake up now. And this will all be just an amusing dream.
Arsenal fan here. Love my club to death, but I love the game just as much. Got a little emotional watching this ngl. If i were a pro i would have died on the pitch for Klopp because you can tell hed do the same for his players.  Sad to see him leave the Prem but he will be back in the game soon enough
The inspirational one
Jürgen Klopp LFC forever YNWA thanks for all the memories. Best wishes for you and your family. You’ll always be welcome at our/your club. Just one thing; win the lot this season. Go out as you came in BOOM
If Man City and VAR didnt cheat.. Klopp would have won the league 5 times.. so well done Jürgen! Best manager we had in 30 years
People tell you what they want you to hear.
Thank you Jürgen YNWA
❤  fucking adore you words cant describe what you have done for our club god bless Boss Thank you is not enough you have a Red in tears here because us the fans adore you YNWA Boss ❤
Thank you for everything mister klopp as a liverpool fan from France 🇫🇷 its a sad Day for me really beacause i support liverpool since 23 years 💔 ❤
Drive on Liverpool, win the quadruple, send this man off on a high.. we are Liverpool
Xabi for the job😛
Top man 👏👏👏
Every beautiful thing eventually comes to an end. It’s not so important what people think when you come in... It’s much more important what people think when you leave”   - Jurgen Klopp
you will be missed boss! here to a great ending to this beautiful era ❤️
What a wonderful man❤. I knew this day will come, but I thought he would be with us one more season🥲. I can't imagine the club without him, but I'm very happy for him❤. I think we all love him like a family member❤. He deserves a statue because not only he transformed the team but also created a family atmosphere. Thank you Klopp❤
Gracias, Klopp❤
😢
We want Klopp to not leave 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Contracted until 2026, leaving so soon and not really giving the club adequate time to find a replacement! He told the club in November? like that's enough time???    People mentioning Xabi and Gerrard are all you need to know why this leaves the club in a bit of a mess!
Any player would want to player for klopp. Fantastic manager and he b brings the best out of the players. Never give up mentality
Thank you for everything Sir Mr Jurgen Klopp.. there's no words to describe my gratitude for what you have done for our amazing club, happy retirement Sir...
Maybe Jose Mourinho this time 😢
This sucks
Legend
GOOD RIDDANCE. Oi dont try to be nice with all this nonsense , just say that you want to go barca or germany. Much better you leave this week.
Klopp will always be in our hearts. As fans we owe him our greatest support in every game from now on. We are going to root and cheer harder no matter the result, every moment now we need to cherish all the way.
So sad to see him go ❤ he's pretty much irreplaceable 😢
sad day for the PL - Chelsea fan, great manager and very likeable chap. All the best in your future endeavours Klopp.
This is a dark moment. End of an era. I don’t like it but I appreciate this man for everything he did and wish him the best of luck.
You can be sure that he literally puts everything he has into his Job. Into his team, into his staff. He always did. And he raised all teams to new levels. Mainz, Dortmund and Liverpool. He is a legend everywhere. For as he is as he is❤❤❤
The greatest manager liverpool football club ever had.sad to hear hi is leaving .can't believe .
Life long Schalke Fan over here. Jürgen Klopp made me watch Mainz, Liverpool and even Dortmund. I followed him along all these years and I will truly miss him at Liverpool. Wonderful soul. I understand the decision tho very well and wish u will find something other than football that will give a bit more of whatever u need in ur life Kloppo, good that u take care of urself <3
Klopp is the only Liverpool manager I've ever known.  As a Yank who started following EPL after watching the Hillsborough 30 for 30 in '14 and subsequently falling in love with the people of Liverpool and the team, I am heartbroken.  I played many sports as a kid, and I can say unreserverdly Klopp is the type of coach I could only dream of having.  A coach that believes in you and builds you up while also holding you accountable and being tough when necessary.   His connection and love for the fanbase is also remarkable.  The three fist pumps to the kop were always a highlight.    It will be strange and unnerving to watch another manager walk the touch line.  All that said no one person is bigger than the club.  YNWA is a not just a song that is sung.  It is a way of life and the principal on which this club stands.  I will cherish my memories of club glory under Klopp and the excitement and enjoyment this team has brought me.  The comeback against Barca; Origi's header to beat Everton; The 3 goal barrage to start a CL match against City; Allison with the game winner....there are too many memories to count.    I also have to say, this team has helped me bond with my little brother.  He is 10 years younger than I am, so growing up we weren't that close.  He moved to Seattle, WA and became a Sounders fan.  I turned him on to the Reds and their amazing Metal press.  We have watched matches together and we are both lifelong Reds fans as a result.  I have Klopp to thank for that.  You can be assured we will be making a pilgrimage one day to the hallowed grounds of Anfield.  I will weep at the eternal flame and place my note of remembrance at the shrine dedicated to the 97 people who lost their lives watching the team they loved.  I will watch my team play and I will be happy.    Thanks Jurgen.  YNWA JFT97
Berharap xabi alonso dan stevie bahu membahu meneruskan kejayaan klopp

Even my greatest hopes for Klopp as a manager at Liverpool have been long surpassed. He’s been nothing short of incredible in his time here as a manager and a person. He will be missed terribly. YNWA Juergen
Jurgen, one thing is for sure... YOU WILL NEVER SMILE ALONE 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Saudi bound 😂
😭😭
Can someone bring me back to the Jurgen signed for Liverpool. I know covid is hard, seeing Liverpool beaten by madrid twice in the final also hard, or even we got destroyed by Aston Villa. But, to see this guy leaving is absolutely heartbreaking. I'm sorry. But danke Jurgen, let's Rock for the rest of the season
Am cring 😢😢😢😢😢
In his opening press conference 10 years ago he said it is not important what people think of you once you come in, it is important what people think of you when you leave the club.  Klopp was not only the coach of Liverpool football club he was important for the whole city.
I'm broken heart 😭💔
I'm cutted totally cutted, but I wish him the best and also to thank him for what he as done for my team Liverpool who I have supported for 45 years and he as become not just our manager but our friend to all Liverpool supporters around the world, I have so much respect to you as a person and a true chetlman❤️🙏👏
Not a Liverpool fan but respect this man, great manager, great coach and even better an honest and good human being
Have jurgen been diagnosed with some illness or depression ? Damn 😬
Thank you Jurgen  You have changed my life
Alonso will destroy liverpool like Graham Souness did 😒 we need someone as good as kloop Alonso maybe doing well in the bundesliga with leverkusen but premier league a whole different ball game pardon the pun raging over kloop leving I'm fucking gutted back to the drawing board and down hill from there next season watch 14/15th in premier league ☹️
We need to put a poll for Klopp if he should leave or not and nevertheless we need to give him an unlimited budget. We need 5 more years  no this guy meant a lot to me
I dont have anything to say, its soo sad😢
Villa fan here , he will be missed , hes been a force and loved his work and what he's brought to the prem.
Thank you Jurgen  You have changed my life
You broke our hearts today…but we will forever love you Jurgen YNWA
😢 It’s like Dalglish 1.0 all over again
Give it to Stevie G until Christmas, or better Jose Mourinho to put them back where they were in the 90s and 00s 😂😂🎉🎉
Even great personalitys like Jürgen Klopp are just humans. Very reflected and well-sorted person! All the best, Kloppo!
Thanks for the memories.  I'm not surprised that he's decided to go but still surprised when i saw the news.  Burn out is a major issue and at the end of the day, each person can only give so much until they realise that they need to stop.
Thank you jurgen for everything ❤
Get Xabi Alonso in immediately.
OMG, it's unbelievable !  Thank you for all the amazing memories, Jurgen, "the best normal guy." I recognize that every good thing eventually comes to an end, and it feels like I'm in a surreal nightmare witnessing this. However, I have faith in your judgment and I wholeheartedly respect your decision, boss!  Thank you boss !!! Thank you Jurgen !!!
Crying right now, never thought this would happen as soon as it has. But what a wonderful amount of time at this club. Klopp has absolutely reformed the entire club from a sleeping giant to one of the best clubs in the world. Ill miss you forever, YNWA ♥♥
This is a bad surprise 😢
He was the greatest Liverpool manager this club has ever had imo. He won it all! I'm saddened, but I totally respect his decision on leaving. He needs to do what's right for himself. All of us will never forget those 8 glorious years that he and the team gave to us fans! Best of luck with future endeavours. Once a red, always a red! YNWA LIVERPOOL FOREVER THE LEGEND THAT IS, JURGEN KLOPP! ❤🇩🇪
as an arsenal fan i'm happy and sad at the same
YNWA
Jürgen Klopp will leave a great legacy. I am sure that Liverpool fans feel privileged to have had one of the greatest managers of all time. The EPL will be poorer for his leaving.
he looks like he's lost a lot  of weight i hope he's okay
I can't stop crying. Thank you so much, BOSS❤❤❤
Luton fan here, this is a big loss, obviously for Liverpool, but also for the Premier League, the word legend gets banded about too freely these days, but Mr Klopp, you most definitely are one 👏👏❤❤
Thank you Jurgen, you are so loved ❤
German here. Even I am sad. Hope you win the PL, Jürgen! All the best!
Thank you Jurgen. You have been amazing, and made Liverpool Magnificent again. I sens ehow this is the right decision for you, so thank you for making this video, Best wishes for the future.
Jurgen, one thing is for sure... YOU WILL NEVER SMILE ALONE 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Nooooo 😢😢
Thank you for some really special moments. It's been an amazing ride but all good things come to an end. YNWA
Best decision he made as a kop coach to leave! Hope he get at least a medal to end on a high!
Jürgen we will always love you and we all want to build you a statue outside our stadium
*YNWA Jürgen Klopp*  I cried like a baby when I saw Liverpool win the premier league in 2020, a club that I have followed since 2005. I fell in love with the great team they had at that time, and I became an idol of Gerrard, because I saw some similarities in him , like a strong shot from mid-range, race, never giving up. I had Deco as an inspiration too, my first, from my FC Porto. In my childhood and adolescence I had 3 references, Deco, Gerrard and Ronaldinho Gaúcho. I also suffered when I saw Liverpool down, after 2010, where the team started to lose some quality and had practically 3 years below expectations. those 2 yankees were a disgrace. But the new, the currently, they did a great job, it could be better, of course, with smarter investments at the right time, they were one of the rare times they made mistakes, but ok.  *THANKS FOR ALL, KLOPP*  I Hope Xabi Alonso comes to Liverpool, I really liked him alongside Gerrard, and he is doing an excellent job at Bayer Leverkusen.  Or De Zerbi, who also has a very good ideology, one of the best in the Premier League alongside Klopp, Guardiola.
Thats what we heard previously in Dortmund
He will be remembered,  always as member of the family.❤
Klopp forever ❤
I’m so happy Jürgen is a red ❤
How does he manages to create so much beauty from his words? His words have enough power to shook the world
Jürgen Klopp is the reason why I love LFC. And he's talking about himself leaving this team after about 30 games in this video. After he leaves, can I still love LFC? I'm confused. I can't imagine other manager sitting on Anfield manager bench. I may miss him for all my life. Jürgen, I wish you succeed everything you'll do. I'll always be your fan. And thank you soooo much.
simply the best. better than pep. pep makes players football his game. Klopp assembles a team based on talents and buys the skills he needs in cheap players. he has the best substitutes, by stats like 5 time more efficient as other coaches. dude is a tactical genius. what a legend.
How does he manages to create so much beauty from his words? His words have enough power to shook the world
It’s crying time
what a legend.. what a motivator. Like the last sekvens got me pumped up ! lets GO!
Viewing as a Chelsea fan. This guy is pure class. 💙
YNWA Jürgen ❤️
Jurgen, pls stays!
I'm a passionate liverpool fan from Vietnam, I was shocked when I heard this news, I can't even have a delicious dinner when I keep thinking about it, god bless klop, xabi alonso to liverpool fc, here we go 💘💘💘
It's nice to hear he'll never manage another club in England
On holiday currently and this news has brought me to tears..Reds fan of 42 years..Lost for words. Really  hard for this to sink in.
Thank you for everything, Jurgen!
Has he been sick?
Jurgen will  be always red 😢😢❤❤ynwa

God Bless your family and you ... stay happy and enjoy your life thoroughly .. YNWA ... Respect period  for you
I know when the first day he join Liverpool he said he is the normal one, but deep down in all of the fans heart, we knew he is the special one and the achievement he brought us. It is priceless. Now please build him a statue already. Love from a fan from Malaysia
Absolutely gutted! Thanks for everything boss. Been an awesome ride, now let’s finish on a high!!!!
🥰🥰🥰❤️🧔🏼❤️🥰🥰🥰
If you need a break for 1 year, i would be happy to let pep lijnders step in for a year and you return to us, i can't imagine you managing another club now. I feel there's more reason to him leaving than we know
As an Arsenal fan I'm gutted that the premiership will be losing such a charismatic, super nice guy and  the top manager in the world better than Guardiola as Guardiola is a cheque book manager. Sorry to see you leaving Mr Klopp.
Next  coach welcome  you were a once upon a time a player a good.player  now a manager  welcome Xabi Alonso you YNWA  players fans  supporter we all love you and klopp will always be in our prayers  always.Klopp a msn.of wisdom😢😢❤❤❤❤😂
liverpool games will never be the same without this man at the stands :(
I consider you the greatest coach I’ve been privileged to watch. The passion, the coaching mentality and family environment yoy brought to this club is exceptional. You will always be a Red and You’ll Never Walk Alone🙏🏼🙏🏼
I've thought he looks thin for a while, I hope he is not sick,  ta very much ✌️& ❤ Mate
I miss you klopp  😭😭😭
You made the EPL sweet. From a Man Utd Fan. Thank you man
I’m gutted but I respect everything this amazing man has done for our club and I wish him all the best in the future. You are and always will be Liverpool fc YNWA 😢❤
Thank you for all Jurgen ❤️
As long as u ok thanks for everything one amazing man
Jurgen, take a year off then come back as director of football or something!
I’m crying my eyes out this man has been with Liverpool for as long as I remember  Klopp thank you for everything YNWA
😢
Thank you so much , Klopp. You will be missed, Sir. Enjoy your break, your normal life as you said, that is a great decision, life needs a break  . Thank you so much again🙌🙌🙌
From an Everton supporter I believe  Klopp has definitely enhanced the level of the EPL. You will be missed. Thanks for the memories and I wish only the best for you and yours. Legend
Everything is pain now...
Boss I am 51 year old and life long Liverpool fan. I see you Mr. Klopp is the best man for LIVERPOOL ever yes ever. Hope you are well and happy wherever you are Mr. Klopp. We as fans will miss you so so so much. All the best for you.
多くの感動と情熱をありがとう。  これまでも、これからも、あなたはフットボール史上最高の監督です😢❤
He looks old and tired and I say that as a massive LFC fan.  He is a Liverpool legend and he should retire from football, you can see it. Life is more important and I've been dreading the day this would come and now we have to move on and wish Jurgen and his family every happiness in the future..
Watching this man who has no idea I am, has been so influential to my growth by the simple way of being himself and wearing the heart and soul of Liverpool every single damn time. Thanks for every single moment throughout these 9 years Jurgen, You'll Never Walk Alone  <3  P.S.: every single game was about you.
Build the man a statue !!
Massive news. Sir Alex Ferguson type news. We will definitely break this shocking news down in our next episode (and why we think it could be a hoax..)
He will always be a lfc legend❤
Next Manager Xavi? De zerbi?
Good riddance your lost Liverpool the day you let Mané go. Hit a like if you agree.
We love you Klopp , one of the best Liverpool mangers of all time. A legend!
😢😢Nooooooo!
I'm pretty sure Xabi Alonso is going to be the next Liverpool coach
I an not a Liverpool fan. In fact, I support a rival EPL club. But this sudden decision has shaken me to my foundations. His impending departure sounds like death to me. Talking in general terms, Jurgen made football richer. The sport will definitely be poorer without him. So long, Herr Klopp!

after doing something for so long its just normal to run out of fuel or to feel chained by it . Kloppo: Tank auf und mach ne Weltreise ! Gute Entscheidung. Liverpool wird dich nie vergessen. Hoffentlich machst du ins irgendwann nochmal den Nationaltrainer <3! Ansonsten alles Gute im Normal Life Normal Guy !
We love you, Mr. Klopp. Thank you for everything you are and everything you have done for this community.
Will he Join Ajax 😮
Why am I crying yet he has almost achieved everything with Liverpool.Lots of love from Kenya,Africa.YWNA❤
I love this man ... sitting in here, understanding his word knowing why, but also so sad he's leaving. You will always be our boss YNWA X
i am fucking crying, i will always adore this man
Gutted but Jurgen leaves with the same amount of respect as Sir Kenny for me and i can't speak of him  more highly than that YNWA
He wants to live a normal life, for once. He wanted a break, and deservedly so. He's been manager for 24 years and a player as well before that. Thank you Jürgen, You'll Never Walk Alone.
All the best Jürgen <3
Thank you, Jürgen Klopp. You did pretty well for almost 10 years since you joined Liverpool F.C. as a manager. After winning for your first Premier League title, the club will never be the same without you. Thank you, Jürgen. We will miss you very much. Take care of yourself.
Man City fan here and I'm GUTTED. This guy is so GREAT, so much CLASS. This is a HUGE loss for the club, the league and the sport. Wishing him ALL THE BEST for whatever is next.
Thank you for the victories and all the memories you brought for the fans around the world who supported Liverpool FC, Jurgen. YNWA❤
At 38 Years I have loved you Gaffer.....😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 My heart is 💔 but I will never forget Jurgen Klopp The Truest Rock n Roller in Liverpool FC.
Absolutely devastated. All I can say is Thank you for everything Jurgen. YNWA.
......and this is why Jürgen Klopp is the best football manager on this planet.
Hope Liverpool wins everything, I used to hate the club but he changed my mind. He is different than most managers, one of the most authentic, with his own style on and off the pitch. It's about more than wins and losses.
the man is another Bill Shankly, THATS the effect hes had on the club, its a sad sad time for the club we will be VERY hard pushed to find someone that earned the love and respect not only of the players but the millions of liverpool supporters, he will be so greatly missed
Jurgen Don't leave please
เมื่อคุณจากไปหวังว่าลิเวอร์พูลของเราจะยิ่งใหญ่ขึ้นไปอีก ขอให้เป็นเช่นนั้น.
Thank you boss. You can take a break. Just come back to LFC sometimes, I just want to see you on TV like I have been watching liverpool and you for 8 yrs.
Heartbroken 💔
As a Newcastle fan I should be delighted about this but I find myself feeling for Liverpool fans. Good luck to the man for the future and the club for replacing him. What a classy way to leave. I'm sure he'll never walk alone.
"A difficult one, but the right one." I can really feel that.  It shows why you are the boss / the true leader.  We will miss you.
Rat jumping ship
Liverpool people like this interviewer sound like such cry babies. Listen to his voice. Sounds like he’s going to cry. Weak people.
bomboclatt!
You will be very missed and right now my heart is breaking you right a great liverpool manager and you are world class your name will live on all the best to you and your family you will never walk alone king klopp😢
I was meant for Jurgen, he was meant for me
plz stay for 1 more season
Thanks for everythings Jurgen. I'm respect your decision. YNWA
fsgout there two man just can reblace klopp  xabi  de zerbi
Liverpool will be in decline after this man is gone. Let's cherish the trophies he won for us. Hopefully, his announcement could spur his team to win the EPL, Europa League, FA Cup, and Carabao Cup as a tribute, adding a cherry on top of his already illustrious career.
As an arsenal fan this man has caused me nothing but pain.   Still I salute him on his way out. He deserves to be up there with Wenger Ferguson mourinho as one of the all time greats.
Thanks Klopp we got you. Let’s go for the rest of the season and end up Premier League Champions !!
😢😥😓😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is a nightmare..and we're not even kick City from his comfy zone..
This man changed the game. Huge respect 🫡 .
What a wonderful man. I have had so much joy as a Liverpool supporter during Júrgen's tenure as manager. I hope both he and his family find peace, happiness and great joy when he begins the next part of his journey at the end of this season. You have given the club everything you could and so thanks to Júrgen all the Klopp family for what they have done for us at Liverpool.
One of the best to ever do it.
Thank you for your time. 😢
I never seen any individual like him. Such a wonderful manager brought good energy and entertainment into this club and football in general.
Jose please 🙏🏼
One covid trophy winner 😂😂
It’s hard to say goodbye to someone who has been such an integral part of Liverpool Football Club for so long. Your passion, dedication, and leadership have been an inspiration to fans all over the world. You have brought so much joy and success to the club, and your legacy will live on for years to come. Thank you for everything you have done and continue to do for Liverpool. You will be missed, but never forgotten.❤
Thankyou Jurgen ❤
He will be hard to follow.
🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇🙇😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
I will ride my elephant from Africa to Europe to personally build this man a statue if LFC don’t😭  What a Legend! YNWA♥️
Me and my dad cried while watching this😢. We will always love klopp❤❤
😢
Please no😥😥😥❤️❤️❤️
😢😢😢😢
Started actively following Liverpool couple of years before Jurgen Klopp came and now I am DEVASTED to see him go. No player leaving will make me feel this gutted, but Klopp leaving has demolished  me to the core💔💔
So sad
Please don't leave 😢😢
Hugest of hugs to you sir. Amazing run. Amazing transformation of the club, city, team and love of the fans. YNWA … ever. ❤
amazing that he will finally come to bayern <3
Dear Jürgen. Thank you for being so honest. You came to the club whenn it was the most needed and you proved yourself together with the team and all the loving fans at Anfield and around the world. I'm from Denmark but I've been a longtime follower of LFC. I can just express my deepest respect for what you've done for the club and I want to give you a massive THANK YOU.
I'm still not able to process he's going but respect jk it must-have been a hard decision to make who can replace him ? I like Xavi but he's no klopp mate pep is the best man to deserve the gaffer's chair and who's going to be that person to appoint a new manager I hope u don't lose any sleep its like capt j.t kirk leaving star trek or yr pet dying pr living a loved one good luck ❤tefflon kid
⚽️❤️🔥🙌
Thanks Klopp ❤from Somalia 🇸🇴
I am in shock but were ever u go Kloop Y.N.W.A 😢
Well thank you Jurgen for everything. Next to Shankly and Paisley you are the most important person in Liverpool Football History and even City history as you almost singlehandedly brought Skouse and Liverpoodlians together.  I and we all appreciate that you and your family need to have a normal life and that this level of intensity for this long must be draining and exhausting. .Danke Fader.....Here come the dark years again.  The real question is are you retiring or skipping to another club
Thank you for making us believe again.
Felt right to pay homage to klopp, fantastic record, didn't always have the money to spend and won everything. The prem will be a lesser league without him...... I genuinely good egg. Health and happiness jurgen.. from this spurs fan.
My goodness this is unbelievable to watch, just when I thought we move and keep dominating the world😢😢 my goodness 🎉you have been amazing Jurgen
Who u think we goin for xabi?
13:00 the right one indeed. What a Gaffer, we are the luckiest fans in the world to have had such a manager.YNWA. We get to enjoy our last 30 fist pumps. Its been a fairly tale.
Pls come to man UTD
💔
Respect Herr Klopp 👍👍
Jumping a sinking ship 😂
Thank you for all this memories. Youre the best manager ever and we thank you for all. YNWA
Off you pop klopp 👋
The Man is exhausted, you can see it on his face. He’s been this way from last Season, you could & can see the physical change.
Thank you for everything boss the  streets of Liverpool will never forget you and we fans may this last chapter be with titles you will never walk alone 🙌😪
❤❤❤❤
Get this man a statue outside Anfield tomorrow
I'm sorry, Jurgen, you know how to break a heart at the most inopportune moment. I understand that you are tired and you have done so much for the club and all the fans for so long. But at a time like this, not even in 2025, but now, it just hurts. Win at least the 2nd title of the Premier League at parting, because the promised parade after the first victory due to covid-19 did not take place.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
SAD DAY. ONLY FAULT THE OWNERS
This guy has a spell of normal life to reflect on his love time and loyalty to every club he managed
Thank you Koop for all the good moments
Liverpool will be fine❤ as long as they stay away from "the special one" aka Mourinho🫣🫣🫣
He’s going now to come back again in the future. ❤
Thank you Jürgen, for all the great memories, we look forward to just a few more. You have been a blessing since you decided to join Liverpool and we wouldn't have it any other way. Some decisions are hard to accept, but we do accept and understand this one.
😂😂😂😂😂
Aku rs dia nk jd jurulatih jerman lps euro thn ni. Klu jd jurulatih negara x tension sgt mcm dkt kelab
😢😢😢
Bundestrainer or back to BvB please!
Wow Jorgen we will always love you. Thanks for the work and all the good moments we had. We still miss you.
Wish all the best for Klopp!
Even though my heart is broken, I can only thank Klopp for helping us get back to where we deserve to be as a club, competing for top spot in every competition and winning every trophy possible. Thank you Jurgen, you will go down in history as an Anfield legend and will never walk alone.
I'm like him😢
It's so scary we can't replace him.
That analogy of being the race car and to be the only one seeing the needle going down broke my heart
Had a feeling this was coming?? Klopp will always be a Red! Let’s go out with a Bang! Win the League once again in front of a packed Anfield! Along with a Cup or 2 YNWA!! Utmost respect with him making this decision
Jürgen, you're a scouser mate. You are one of us. You'll Never Walk Alone. Although I'd rather have you staying with us for a few years more.
I never thought I would love a man like I do with jurgen. It’s definitely ruined my weekend but I wish kloppo all the best in the future he deserves it. Ynwa kloppo
One of a kind! Danke Jürgen
Thanks Jürgen for the memories 🎉
😢😢😢
Thank you Jürgen.  I love your football and your teams are always a joy to watch.  Honest, hardworking, teamwork,.skill, physical everything that I would want from a football team.  I will always remember until the day I die, all the great memories and times you have bought to me.
I trusted every word you say klopp
Let's end it with a BOOM! Everyone going to Anfield for the rest of Jurgen's games: please give it your best for all of us he made smile and believe again who can't be there.
Юрген Вы величайший дерижор Великого оркестра, конечно очень грустно что Вы уйдёте, но я уверен что Ваш оркест будет давать отличные концерты на полях всего мира. Низкий поклон Вам Юрген и удачи во всём.

This guy bring love wherever he goes. YNWA Jurgen!! You lot will be miss
My heart is broken 😭 A true legend without any doubt!!!
Pulling the emergency brake before he completely burns out. This is how he left Dortmund as well.
Jürgen Klopp is one of the best things that could have happend  to LFC. He single handedly transformed the club. YNWA Jürgen
After watching Basketball all my life, I grew up in Los Angeles, watching and cheering on The Lakers all my life. Then, I moved to the bay and watched the Golden State Warriors grow to be champs. About six years ago, I grew out of Basketball; I became bored with the sport. I was always interested in soccer(football). I decided to jump in more and more and started watching PL games. My love grew, grew and grew for the game. I can remember two moments that cemented me in the sport. One was watching the Ajax vs Tottenham Champions League match with Lucas's hat-trick. The second was just Klopp. It's weird to obsess over a man, but Klopp is different. I could go on and on about Liverpool players, but Klopp. His energy, positivity, mentoring, and fun nature are stronger than the game to me. This is a massive loss for LFC, but I wish to thank this man for making me a fan of this club and the sport. Klopp, I wish you nothing but the best in life!
I really hope that emotions don't cause Liverpool to bring Gerard in. He will trash the club.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
what a guy ❤️
Ok! I can remember vividly almost 9 years ago when Liverpool wanted to sign Jürgen, the news then breaks out   that “ Jürgen Klopp has decided to end short his sabbatical leave to take up Liverpool Fc Job “ 🤩, Now he really needs To go out and take that Leave, after 9 years! It Has Been a Memorable and Wonderful Journey with Sir Jürgen Klopp ❤❤❤! Health Wise You need to Leave And Have A Normal Life ❤, Thanks You Jürgen ❤ You Are Always A Red ❤!
With this team it wont matter were too good its the players who score goals not the manager
Mr Klopp you sir are so respected, a great manager, focused & your enthusiasm for the game immeasurable.  I wish you well in your future life, 74+ 🍁 BLADES fan still  Yorkshire expat
I was watching Jurgen's first press conference with us. He really turned doubters to believers and he surely is going to be remembered with things he did when he leaves instead of when he joins. Thank you for everything, and I wont be making our club, our games to be you as you have mentioned until May. I am not flattered by the decision but I am accepting it, and it would be a right decision for you and your family Jurgen Thank you Jurgen❤
Please don't, leave😢
Bad news 😢
Jurgen Klopp, you're a legend. Let's finish your tenure with a bang!
Let’s face it he’s an awesome manager and the controversy around the PL , and point deduction and the crazy VAR…..who wouldn’t want to leave.  Football is not fun anymore due to all the craziness surrounding the PL
Thank Jurgen Klopp for everything you've done 😢😢and hope we got another Normal One just like you❤️❤️ YNWA.
What a manager, what a man. Jürgen is just amazing. Once red.. always a red. ❤
im not even a liverpool fan and im crying. LEGEND
Hope Jurgen enjoys every last minute of the rest of this season. He deserves to
Mo Salah will leave for the Saudi League in December after Klopp's departure
😢😢😢😢😢
Liverpool is klopp and klopp is Liverpool ❤
This man rebuilt the club and made us on off the best teams in the world  Thank you for All the good times YNWA❤
This is definitely the saddest interview I have witnessed in my life. Thank you Jurgen for everything ❣
Все мою сознательную жизнь Юрген был тренером Ливерпуля. На моих глазах команда выиграла все что можно! Великий тренер! Спасибо за все!❤
Thank you for everything boss ❤️
At the end of beautiful journey 😢 I wish you a good luck our hero ❤ And I'm gonna miss you🥲👋
Whyyyyyyyyyyy😢
.....enter Steven Gerrard from Saudi Arabia ???.....I know this maybe pure speculation, but I wonder "IF" part of his decision is based on Mohammed Salah possibly leaving Liverpool FC at the end of this season to play in Saudi Arabia's new Football League next year ?.....additionally, Jurgen Klopp has nothing else to prove, as he says here, he "MUST" have a genuine challenge, he's won everything at the highest level within professional English football, likewise in Europe.....the timing is perfect, Jurgen Klopp leaves Liverpool FC on a "HIGH", possibly winning the quadruple including the Europa League.....
❤
Why does he want to leave
We love you klopp, we're gonna miss you.
Not a Liverpool fan but what a great man . Bet stevie g has already started packing
Danke Klopp ❤ Thanks for being a red and for making us from doubters to believers 🔴🔴🔴
Why now
I’m not a Liverpool fan but I respect him as a manager and his decision fair play to him to put his hands up and say he’s done
no
Real Madrid
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Zimbabweans, this guy was a CCC supporter you see.
Why he gatta leave us like that he watched me grow up 😭😭
Life is so unfair and so unjust....when things seem to fall on the right place all again..and BOOM...this news comes in..as a LFC fan this is the most devastating news one could have ever dreamt of....!!!! Absolutely shattered 😢😢😢😢😢😢
I rearly cry. Now the tears came running. This is heartbreaking
I'm not a Liverpool fan but I receive so much inspiration from this man. A great and beautiful human being that literally transcends beyond football, JUST SPECIAL
Total respect to Klopp for being honest
Thank you for all you have done for the fans and Liverpool Fc..The best manager ever!! .Klopp's Liverpool is always exciting to watch..but no point being sad..he is also a human being like us and deserves a break.. we all know he is made for Liverpool and has created wonders for Liverpool ..🚩 Regardless of whoever is the next manager..that doesnt make my love for liverpool fade ..YNWA🚩
He said he won't be managing a club or country for at least a year... I feel that. Sometimes us humans just need to break out of our loops/routines for a while, enjoy some personal freedom, do some quiet reflection and or pursue other interests. Our devices need recharging and so do we. Truth is, whether things end on a high note or low note, the world moves on and replaces us, because it must. We must never see ourselves as a permanent fixture at a job/workplace.
He did a Roberto let's be honest
Klopp must have saw FSG's budget for next season & said nah,  I'm not doing that sell2buy nonsense again.
Absolutely gutted. What a legend, thank you klopp for everything u put lfc bk where they belong. Y.N.W.A we will welcome you back when u decide to return to football
As a Barcelona fan I'm sad for Liverpool supporters 😢
Arsenal fan here, I love this man. What he has done for football with Liverpool is incredible. I love watching Klopp’s Liverpool play, it is always a joy. His passion matching the intensity of Liverpool fans’ passion has been artwork in motion. Take it easy Jurgen, you will be missed ❤
Thank you Jurgen!
Welcome to Barcelona
One of the greatest manager for Liverpool. Rest up and enjoy time with your grandchild. Thank you klopp
Salah must be leaving 🤣🤣🤣 he knows the trophies will dry up
He is drained. Damn. He puts his whole energy into it all. What a guy. Best of luck man ❤. From an Arsenal fan.
What a fantastic human being. All the best to you Jürgen and thank you for everything YNWA.
All respect for you, sir ! I am not supporting Liverpool and I never will,  but you are not only incredible manager, but most importantly a human being! Wish you all the very best!
Saddest day of my life. Omg. :(
Wow 🥲
I'm in pieces - but - he's right about this, as he's been right about the game, throughout.  what a gift he's already made to the club - so, onwards and upwards. Man muss die Dinge nehmen, wie sie kommen
Im so glad that Jürgen is a red  I’m so glad he delivered what he said And Jürgen said to me yknow We’ll win the premier league yknow  He said so! I’m in love with him and I feel fine YNWA❤JÜRGEN
I'm a Cardiff fan and my boy is a mad Liverpool fan he is so gutted but klopp you brought a better standard and fun to the premier league not for getting how you bought the people of liver pool together klopp I also thank you for how much of a great man you are here to wishing you the best in all you do god bless you Mr klop. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.
I have nothing but mad respect for you Jurgen. You deserve to be happy and live the life you want, if anyone deserves it, it is you. Words can not express how thankful I am for all these years. Just know that wherever you go, you will never walk alone. Thank you so much for everything, and for making us all so happy.
Legend!
very few managers nowadays can leave the club without actually getting the sack. Jurgen is an absolute legend for the game!
Not a Liverpool supporter, this man is a one off. English footballer has been better with him involved and will be worse without him. Make him England manager.😊
Scousers losing Klopp and Salah in one season goodbye Liverpool 😂😂
This is why klopp means so much for this generation of fans as shankly meant to those who followed liverpool in the late 50s and through to the late 70s when he announced he was leaving .
Tired... Tired of the corruption more like. YNWA Jürgen
Thank you jurgen
Words will never describe how I'm feeling Right now. Give us a Klopp end please
Liverpool are fucked now hahaha. Back to the bottom of the board🤣
Klopp, you did your best. Thank you for everything you've done for me! by the way, I'm so sad.....we'll not forget you. - Liverpool fans -
I miss you jurgen klopp 😢😢😢
God save the king .
😭
The greatest coach of the world !!!
😢😢😢😢😢😢
Gaffer, i really dont know what to say. I never thought this day would come. We love you Jurgen!😢
KLOP, my "MAN" why now ? i got know what football is because of this gentleman and now am totally astonished from the news i watched in YouTube few hours ago, that my best COACH ever is nolonger with me anymore. Fine BUT then  I don't have any power to STOP this. All i can say JURGEN KLOP GOD bless you and your entire family. SHALOM SHALOM SHALOM. from NAIROBI-KENYA.......................
Definetely the normal one !
Thank you for always making every week exciting. Because of you there is something to always look forward to in every week. I do hope this is a ‘see you again’ rather than a ‘goodbye’. But again I respect your decision and I wish you the very best Kloppo.   Your Liverpool was a joy to watch.
Kllop I very sad and pissed
My favourite manager of my lifetime. He will be missed and I hope the team can win everything as a goodbye present. I hope for Alonso in June.
Thank you, Jurgen. All Liverpool fans watched this with tears in our eyes.
Such an honest statement! because of him LFC becomes a force again after 2015! Love for LFC and for this man, one of the best club manager I have ever seen. and last of all YNWA. Cheers! Coach Jurgen Klopp. Wish i could see him live his punches in the Enfield air! Love and Respect.
Thanks for everything Jurgen. You've been a great manager. Good luck in the future. ❤
😅
I’m not even a Liverpool fan but I’m feeling a little sad that there will be no more Klopp in the premier league!!!!
Don't go klopp
Something ain’t right. He knows something we don’t. He would never leave.
Thanks for the wonderful memories Jurgen. YNWA ❤
thank you klopp for all you did for the club. We love you man. YNWA🔴
❤️
Shanklin, Paisley, Fagen,Moran  etc how lucky am I to see LFC through the,ages. Excellent or poor LFC YNWA
Come to Chelsea
So heartbreaking news, but it was inevitable. the best manager I have ever seen. Thank you, Jurgen. Reds fan from Somalia.
a statue for klopp is not an overstatement
Ive got alot of sadness but also so much pride in my club and manager to let us as fans know whats happening within. Thanks for making us believers again KLOPP ❤ now go win that word cup for Germany again 🍻🍻
I am crying man
Klopp will be a massive loss to the English game from a Newcastle fan. I wish him all the very best in the future 🤍🖤❤️
YNWA Jürgen Klopp, thanks for all, and good luck with your future Jürgen.
YNWA klopp❤
It will be sad to for the whole of football to see klopp go, class manager and always comes across as a really decent human aswell. Good luck in whatever you choose to do after football. From a Leicester city fan💙🦊
Thank u for everything u done for our club and u will be always in our hearts and where ever the future takes u we all wish u the very best ❤ from all our Liverpool family YNWA
all the best boss, we'll never forget what you brought to the club and supports. YNWA
Its not easy being a manager of a club like Liverpool. The expectation is very high, demand for result is constant, burnt out can creep up on you without you realizing.
Now the team is going to drop 5 positions in the log
music to our ears! we had a champion team in 2013 too..... get ready fortnight times  party  is over!
Give us the League, FA cup, EFL and Europa as parting gifts please
He's going to man u mark my words🤞
No way man :(
Even as a united fan I can recognise someone so unique. One of the best managers/coaches ever. How he turned the likes of Robertson world class and was wining things with the likes of Henderson and Milner in midfield just shows us all how great he is. For me better manager/coach than Pep...what he inherited when he took over compared to Pep was far worse. Liverpool will struggle to replace him but the Premiership will be losing a heavy metal legend.
Rare thing in this day and age, chosing when to leave.
Man I'm going to miss klopp and everything he brings to the team. I realised players like salah and van dijk are more prone to leave now.
Noooooooooooooooooo
What a club legend. Greatest manager we've ever had.
best manager in the league. arsenal fan.
The honesty .. pure honesty. I don't have the words to begin to thank you mate.
We will all ways love you
love u klopp. U save liverpool when we are in need. Even when u leave,u will always be part of Liverpool. Thanks for your hardwork and thanks for being a very special manager.
Klopp won everything with Liverpool...for Liverpool... It is going to be heartbreaking❤❤😢
I mean in reality man is 56. How many of us would love to retire at 56 and just chill. People don't really that before anything these guys are humans and it's normal to want to relax
As a Man U fan, I genuinely respect you Sir Klopp....this response shows a real soul for his club and the succession plan he accommodates.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Interesting that he makes these things now..When they play very good..When they are first and fighting for championship..Really really strange...Because this situation now destroy energy in team..Really no reason to do these things now...Could say on the end of the season..But why now...Maybe someone else should be a champion....Who knows...
we are waiting for you in Barcelona 🔴🔵 te esperamos en barcelona 🔴🔵
I feel like my dog just died again
Tears starting to flow..of all manager that I've seen managed Liverpool, Jürgen Norbert Klopp is the one who created the Liverpool football culture in this modern era
Toon fan here…really sad to hear, what a guy, what a manager, hope he’s ok?❤Hope Liverpool get a decent replacement to stop City ffs
I'm an Arsenal fan but I feel very emotional at this sad news for Liverpool and the Premier league as a whole. Klopp's personality as a human being and his great managerial leadership have not only won the hearts of Liverpool's fans but of all football fans all over the world. He has my respect and I wish him well for his future plans. Liverpool fans, take it in a good spirit; you will be fine.
i am seeing that mo salah will  also living liverpool
I’m crying and throwing up
Greetings from Germany. So... our national team kinda sucks and I don't think it's the players' fault. How about another new manager... Who oh who should we wish for?
Oh! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Let the lion rest
Something’s wrong I hope everything works out good luck Mr klopp
I’m so glad Jurgen is a red 😭
Crying at my cubicle this morning. Thank you Jurgen for all of the class, swagger and genuine leadership that you've shown representing our fair club. You took us all on a ride through the greatest highs and some tough defeats but you always represented us with a pride and resiliency that this Club and this City deserve. I can honestly say that I've cherished every moment of it. And while I knew this day would come, one is still never ready for the emotional gut punch that ensues. God bless you and your family on the next chapter of your lives. When/if you decide to return to the touchline, you know you'll always have a home on Merseyside. You'll never walk alone, boss. Walk on.
The man, The father, The Goat, Liverpool. Thank you, Jurgen for everything u did to us❤❤❤
👊👊👊👊
Liverpool won’t be same without you for sure.. Be ready Liverpool fan for 10 years of watching manunited like team in Liverpool logo 😢
I gotta get to Liverpool asap to catch a match… I guess dark times lie ahead…😢
❤❤❤
"I admire both of them, but you can see that era comes to an end" ETH
A great era is coming to an end. Thakns Jürgen for your passion and your dedication to this club. Never will forget this time! YNWA!
the most best think is that kloop is  honest to every single liverpool player .  love you kloop i love you man ,,
What a manger... The greatest that Liverpool has ever had,,, only beaten by Dirty money.. The best in the world not just LDC fans, just everyone
I'm an Arsenal fan, and I feel like crying 😭.
I'm heartbroken😢Please stay
I will be dead inside.... Can someone do something 😢😢😢 with out him we will be lost 😢
We love you too
It's funny how it got rumoured ineos wanted him and Jim did mention it also 😂 now he's leaving Liverpool 😂
Good luck Boss! You deserve to get some rest and relaxation and enjoy life! YWNWA!
I hate Liverpool but I love this coach all the best for him ❤️❤️
you can’t imagine the amount of stress this man has been under for the past 8 years
He's the Honest Man On The Earth ,he tell everything is true. Nothing is forever..will see you again next time.
The way Klopp has made this announcement, and the way in which he spoke of the club, the supporters, the city, and the team all exemplify why he was such a great fit for the club, and also why he will be sorely missed.  We have nothing but gratitude toward him, and we wish him the best. Thank you for every single moment.
Ok, take a break for 1 year, and comeback to be our sporting director?
💔
I'm an Arsenal fan , but I have alot for klopp as a manager . He changed Liverpool and they won everything with him . If pep was not here he would have easily won alot more Premier league tittlea
Te quiero mucho Jurgen, gracias por todo
😢😢😢😢
From a City fan, amazing manager and will be missed. You’ve left your team with great young squad who play fantastic football 👏
😢😢😢
Barca all the way  I'm calling it out because of my extinct  Save it and that's the future
Thank you for all you have done for us Klopp, YNWA!
I’ve wrote things and deleted them all I can say is thank you for everything jurgen ❤
LETS GET XABI ALONSO AS THE NEXT MANAGER OF LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB!!!!🎉🎉🎉
Even as a United fan, I always had respect for him maybe annoying me a few times but I  the whole have to give respect where its due. He looks and seems beaten and looking after his health frim what I'm seeing and hearing. He lost his mum last year, so a culmination on things make one decide what's important. Best of luck in whatever you do because although we are rivals there are more important things in life.
Oh My Gud, what a boss wheat a person.  You will always be my favorit beside Ancelotti. Respect Hr Jürgen
He is so humble, and I'm sure we don't feel weird to say we love him. We should build a statue and give a parade on his final day. He deserves it.
It'd be a nice tribute from liverpool if they win the league this year, as this will be his last season with the team.
Actually gutted what a legend
People we seriously forgetting if he had back up from the Owners in the injury situation, Klopp doesn't need this kind of pressure, Just imagine he have to look at the squad and thinking I don't have depth how i gone play against Man City or even Arsenal, he have to trust young player to perform and he have to do it again and again..I think dear Boss you rest well❤❤❤
Absurdly enough...I totally get it. I coached a youth team for 12 years...and I needed a break. I am very passionate. I can only imagine doing the same at that level. He lasted 8 years. Maybe I'd last 8 months, lol. Coach, your teams are a reflection of you: passion. As a Juve fan, I always enjoyed watching both his Dortmund and Liverpool.
The best ever manager in the world. Its really a big loss for Liverpool. Thank you for everything Jürgen. NOW LETS GO WIN THE QUADRUPLE!!
😢
We are lucky to have witnessed you as our manager Juergen .I’ve never felt this emotional about a manager before but that only means how special you are ! Thank you for everything and forever you will be a part of us .We love you and wish you the best whatever wherever and whenever. Youl never walk alone Juergen .We are family and you have already become family ❤
Thank you. Some great times. Get back to Germany sir and enjoy the bakery. A class act ❤
Thank you Mr. JURGEN KLOPP..YNWA .You leave Liverpool with LFC head held high. And more success to come..we go again
What a guy! Forever a Liverpool manager one way or another <3
Great man! Humble and fair. We got all the energy you gave. We felt it so much at every moment!!! Thank you for beeing such an inspiration just by beeing you. Wish you the best, you should know you'll remain in our hearts <3
Thank you so much for the past 9 years Thanks to you, my Liverpool came back to life Thank you again for giving me the most beautiful 9 years of my life From far away in Korea..
Dont leave😢😢
😢😢😢
Thanks Jurgen. What a man. Announce Xabi Alonso please. ❤
Thank you for everything. YNWA
😭😭
😢😢😢
One of the best ever you will be missed i love your work im a united fan all the best man
From a club to a another. Klopp YNWA (I’m a Arsenal fan)
I love you Klopp ❤
💔
I blame the PGMOL for this🤬🤬🤬 They crushed his spirit 😭
Jürgen would not leave unless he felt could no longer give his very best, that's for sure. I am sad, of course. But fully respect his decision. But....I have to say the timing is very poor.
All the best klopp best manager
I'm not a Liverpool fan but I was born there so I have a soft spot for the club, I used to live in the same area as where he does now and I still have family around that area that have bumped into him when out on a walk and they've said how down to earth and kind he was. Jurgen is one of the best managers this league has had the fortune of seeing and even though he's triumphed against my team more often than not recently he has earned a lot of respect from the supporters outside of the Liverpool fan base. Good luck with whatevers next Jurgen
With or without any trophies by the end of the season, i will cherish the memories this man has brought me. Since starting to watch football and especially Liverpool at the age of 10 to now 20 years laters this man has given so much entertainment, upsand downs, and everything and anything you can think of when it comes to football. We havent won as much trophies as some would think is considered domination. But he made the best Liverpool squad since before the premier League. Ive had a hard week personally with things but this is the saddest thing my hearts in my throat. Deserves a statue and if we win the league every lfc supporter who has the means needs to be there to celebrate 2 titles!! If not this man needs the town painted red for his goodbye nonetheless
Honest guy that gives his all to every project. Why we love him. Why he has to go and give his best to his family.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I'm really sad to hear the news of klopp decision.  I pray and hope he changes his mind.
I’m a Chelsea fan and this even hurts me 💔
YNWA❤
I'm a spectator of the game as I watch many teams perform so I won't say that I stick to just one team as I love the game but I remember thinking last year how much of an impact this man has on this club. Consequently, hearing his thoughts on his decision as he explained that he wants to try to have a simple life now after all that he accomplished, I found that statement so profound and authentic.   To the fans of Liverpool, I am pretty sure you are all gutted but what a beautiful legacy this man gave you! All the best to the future of Liverpool FC!
Kudos to Klopp for what he has brought to Liverpool and the league, and kudos to him for his decision. Its obvious that he loves the club, but every person has to make a decision about their own life, a decision that is right for them. As an Arsenal fan I hope we can get one over Liverpool this year, but I still respect this guy massively.
Thank you jurgen. Obviously heartbroken. But this man has given supports some of the Greatest nights and memories that there is in football.  He's done it all he's won it all.  One of the very best managers this great club has ever had.  Love you always jurgen Y.N.W.A❤
Bayern Munich typing...🍻
Since shankly there has never been a better boss for us, No1 and always will be......legend
Just get Thomas Frank in Brentford  FC - He is a genius
Legend coach , you bring liverpool to top again as normal , farewell YNWA
❤️❤️❤️
I am in pain, Jurgen the ride could have carried on for another decade happily.  Your one of if not the best manager we have ever had, you will be missed and all of Liverpool, the Kop will be wishing you the best and praying for your success in whatever you do 🙏🏿🙏🏻.   (Please Play a part in picking your successor)
I m not crying, u r
I respect him for this. I think he's doing it in the right way. I hope the boys play out of their skins for him now. They owe him that.
nothing but respect. i hope  he´ll enjoy his normal life. enjoy it as fully as possible.
The boss is getting old...losing vitality...thanks Sir...u really made us go back to the glory days...YNWA
Im deeply sad Jurgen that you are leaving but i can understand where you coming from you are a true LIVERPOOL LEGEND i have been a Liverpool fan from a young age im 47 now but you have brought brilliant style and love to the club the finish line is close and like you say your 100% Liverpool still sad
I AM CRYING
Why why whyyyyyyyy?
Best manger itw
AAww man I only just found out cos I've been suffering with depression -  and closed myself out from everything...my buddy in Dubai messaged me about it, and the most messed up thing it didn't make me feel worse, I actually felt love for the first time..  Weird mix of emotions, but thank you Mr Klopp on a personal level... <3
Nooo
Legend 🙏🏼❤️💪🏻
you'll never walk alone😭😭😭😭😭
thank you so much for all your hard work i can understand but i hope your last season is not the  last season l Liverpool fans are happy
I love this man, what an awesome human being... said as a Wolves fan!
I became a Liverpool fan because of him stuck around because of him he truly is one of the  best managers ever. One last prem for Jurgen
Oh man.... I live in Germany. I followed Klopp in the Premier League and became a massive Liverpool fan. I didn't realise it before that I became a fan...lol. But when  Liverpool lost a game, I felt very funny. I didn't want to watch the postmatch analysis directly after watching a game..I needed some time first. This was in the days, when Emre Can was still in Liverpool.  That's when I knew...Lol, I love Klopps style of play. He was the only one who could seriously challenge Bayern Munich in Germany.
Jurgen, can i call u dad?
I'm a Real Madrid fan, but I love this man so much ❤  what a coach 👏
Jürgen can come back now to Germany as Bundeskanzler, of course!
Will never be another ❤💪
Thank you a gazillion times Jürgen for the moments and memories. You will be missed forever to the eternity. Take care, YNWA!
Thanks for everything Jurgen. You made the fans dream again and it's been an amazing journey since 2015. Winning the league means everything now. The cups will be a bonus. This man deserves the best send off possible.
Happy vacation ! Portugal look to be nice in Sommer ;)  Thank You Mr. Normal!!!   :)
Jurgen you have been amazing!!! Just look at Liverpool when you came and where we are right now. You are a LEGEND!!! You deserve to go out on your terms and I wish you all the best!  Be ready for "YOU DESERVE IT!!!" chants and a special song for you on matchdays
MY IDOL MANAGER. AS LIVERPOOL FANS IM SO SAD. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT MOMENTS ,GAMES, & TROPHY. ALL THE BEST FOR YOU COACH, YOU NEVER WALK ALONE. LOVE FROM INDONESIA
I'm an Arsenal fan, but Klopp was the one that got me interested in the prem with that Liverpool team. Major Respect for doing what he did without having the resources like Pep.
I didnt believe this was real
You hve broken our hearts
Living legend....it has been an honor watching him as a coach..no matter where..a bloody fckng honor! And this is the most graceful exist I have ever seen as a coach and I wish him nothing but the best...and I agree with the guys below me..build him the statue now!
Danke Jürgen für all die Jahre. Sowohl bei Mainz, Dortmund und Liverpool eine absolute Legende geworden. Werde niemals das Malaga Spiel vergessen! 🖤💛
That's us winning the league then. Have to make his last a meaningful one
IM A MAN UTD FAN FOR YEARS AND JURGEN KLOPP YOU ARE A GREAT MANAGER GREAT PERSON AND A LIKEABLE PERSON BEST OF LUCK GOING FORWARD WITH LIFE.
Noooo Boss❤😭😭😭😭
💔💔
my favourite manager, one of the most honest and lives with his heart on his sleeve unlike jose. from a Leeds fan can we have him!
He has given everything for Liverpool, and everyone is incredibly thankful for the memories, even as a neutral. Go rest and enjoy life Kloppo
A real Professional!! A lot of People in Sports, Industrie and Politics alike should take him and his doing as an example! An exeptional human!
i've been through many girls and rejections and my first heartbreak was Jurgen Klopp
Denggg.. Let's bring EPL title home for Klopp
25 % of Liverpool is gonna leave liverpool  And if Mo Salah leaves too, then it will be left 50% ... so sad
In Klopp we trust
One of the greatest manager ever
Am a Manchester United fan...but the way Klopp manages his players and shows them father love, made me love watching His team Play. Let's not mention the 7-0 against us😂. Anyway, love You Klopp, all the Best . Much love❤. You'll never walk alone. ❤
3:40 we’re not other clubs. YNWA ❤️
100%, Alonso will replace Klopp it is meant to be
OMG.... :(
But it's not April 1st 😢
This man is and was the one for us. Crying as most of us reds will be. YNWA Jurgen YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE.
I love him so much and I love Liverpool so so much. This is heartbreaking, I want him to get all even though it hurts like hell
Whereever he goes i wish him the best
Danke Jürgen! Also, I'm not crying, you are crying :)
OMG IM GUTTED 😔
I'm a Chelsea fan but I will say it Klop is the best manager of this decade and not Pep. The dude was going toe to toe with someone that has world-class player's all over the pitch.
Jurgen is the greatest manager of his era. His work with Liverpool should be studied both in and out of football. Brilliance personified.
😭😭😭😭😭!! 😭😭😭😭😭!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I broke to pieces when he mentioned dara . He is not doing things for charity sake,, this man truly cares
Though I will totally miss Jurgen at Liverpool and will be singing 'Please don't go' right up to the end of the season, can I just say what a wonderful example of a man taking care of his mental health. So many men would just go on and on, not wanting to look weak or another reason until their health suffers but Jurgen has shown self-understanding  and wasn't afraid to be vulnerable and really talk about his needs not just to his wife and  bosses but pretty much every Liverpool fan across the planet. What a fantastic role model and I have so much respect for you. YNWA
😢❤💪🇨🇴🇨🇴😘🙅😍😗
Jurgen you made our dreams a reality thanks for the memories
Better to leave when you are still wanted than expired. Thank you Sir Jürgen Norbert Klopp ❤💯
noooooooooooooooo!😭
My message to the boss leaving the club, to the club and all the fans…… YNWA
Huge respect for this coach👏🇷🇴🇪🇺
😢
Dia bakal balik klo Liverpool bapuk musim depan, sans ae
Oh gosh, I will miss you so much.
danke klopp,YNWA
A man with a heart loves Liverpool. Jurgen Klop, the great coach of Liverpool, who returned the Liverpool football club to its glorious history and turned it into the strongest team in Europe, won millions of fans, will leave Liverpool at the end of the season. I can't say a word. Being an emotional person who likes poetry, I loved Jurgen Klopp's emotional Liverpool. Because Man with a Heart loves Liverpool.  Jurgen Klopp will remain a Liverpoolian forever."
I'm  at shock,  really speechless 😢
😭😭😭😭😭😭 please tell me it's not true
❤
Reminds me of the German saying "Du sollst aufhören wenn's am schönsten ist." - you should quit when it's as good as could be. In that sense, I wish Kloppo and the FC Liverpool to take the title home one last time together and the memories will for ever be sweet.
I can understand his decision but it’s sad  Let’s just enjoy these last months with this legendary man
Lets go   Win carabao cup Win fa Cup Win UEFA cup Win EPL  Come on  Your Never Walk Alone
Wow he's just made me accept it by watching it I don't like the fact he's going and it's horrible to do so but I back him 100% through the good and the bad YNWA what a great legacy he has left with this club.
Just grateful we had him 💯♥️
The Last Dance.
😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔this breaks us as the kop😭💔
You’ll never walk alone ❤️❤️
There's talkers and then there's do'ers... he did it for the club * he also brought an immense amount of people together.  We'll done Jurgen  and the team has been outstanding.
Danke
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
🥲🫶🏻
Oh No I just realised When he leaves what if Ten Hag join Liverpool nah…. Or Zidane could be a manager nah man I’m not ready to see Klopp leaving Liverpool, YNWA, Thank you for making Liverpool the best as it ever is, Thank you for making me a Liverpool fan, I’ll never regret! Thank you Klopp!
Klopp needs rest, I can feel it from his voice. Good luck Klopp
Thank you boss!! You have brought so much joy to everyone gaffer! Good luck with future endeavors.  😢😢
I never wanted this day to come
Greatest Manager ❤️😭
I love you Kloop and history was made .. thank you YNWA..
Can completely understand his decision. A part of me hopes that he'll come back to manage Liverpool after a year or so, but this is just wishful thinking, right?
...from ESwatini, this man brought diversity into our lives in the way we view & appreciate the spirit of our existence & general life today.. thanks for everything sir!
❤❤❤
It's our last time together
Klopp try to defend the Owners
Let's win the season make this the best
❤😢
can we have a parade for him at the end of the season , say at anfield but there will be more then 60k fans wanting to say thank you and good buy . also would liverpool fc agree to having a statue in his honour on the grounds of anfield and if so can we set up a go fund me etc for it to be built ?
Legend ❤
Brilliant interview and all we can do is respect his decision and keep supporting him and the team. There's a lot more to win this season and what a send off that would be for him. He will always be the best Liverpool manager ever ❤
It will a miracle of season 4 cup.❤❤ Thank you for everything you make for our.
Please stay 😢
as a Liverpool fan I'm not happy at all
A lot of respect for his desicion. Very hard for him to explain his feelings. I hope people realise that.
Build him stature when he leaves to remember him for being the best at what he does. He doubters to believers he more than a manager . YNWA SIR KLOPP
Good news for Manchester United and City
What people say when someone leaves tells a lot about that person's impact. Almost all of the fans are heartbroken, truly a man loved by all. I wonder how many of us turned LFC supporters because of this guy. Jurgen Y will NWA❤
Nah man I'm crying I almost can believe it you are an amazing guy who has been with us through thick and thin and we love you for that ❤
I'm cheering on football for fun during... klopp is manager of Liverpool Since I have supported Liverpool for more than 30 years. Over the past 9 years, I have enjoyed cheering for Liverpool the most.
Maybe Chelsea can finally beat liverpool now without klopp. 🤪
I wish for his return one day ❤
I'm from Brazil and a Fluminense fan. As a football and Premier League lover , for me this guy is the best coach in the world!  He will undoubtedly be missed.
Thank you Klopp for bringing joy, screams and happiness to my life as a Liverpool fan. All the way from Zimbabwe 🇿🇼 ❤
Thank you for everything you give for the club, us fans and football in general! I am heartbroken but wish you all the best BOSS. My hero Jurgen Klopp ❤
😭😭
Hahahahahahahahaha 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋 👹👹
Stunned. Shocked. Gutted.   I'm not usually one for forming attachments to people I've never even met.. but I've never loved another man as much as I love Klopp.   If Liverpool is a religion, Klopp is our God.   The passion.  On and off the pitch, he is special.  Best manager in the world, and an even better man. I've never known anyone like him.  He really did turn us from doubters to believers.  Truly one of a kind.  A legend.   I'm in tears.  This is legit like a break up/ the loss of a loved one.  Feels like I'm in mourning.   They say you never know they're the good 'old' days until they're gone.  Klopp was so special, we knew these were the good days.  Who knew they would become the good old days so soon... :(
Heart broken 💔 But absolutely love him. YNWA Jurgen.
Wise decision. Thank you for all the fun, so far. It's been so much fun, it's hard to comprehend. The Klopp era is not yet over. It will be more fun to come. I am not talking about thropies but being competitive and football out of this world. For me thropies is a bonus. Klopp has done more for the club than I could ask for. I wanted a new Shankly to revitalize the club. Klopp did that besides winning every A class thropies in club football playing top tier football. 8 years managing a team is perfect. Not too short time nur not too long time.  We are Liverpool FC. We will be back. Football will always develope, new names will come, new footballers will come, new managers will come. Liverpool FC is traditionally a club to reckon. That is the most important. Sure a bump here and there but that applies for all.
Nooooo😢😮😢😢😢😢
We love you kloop 😢 and iam shock you leave liverpool (you are legend boss)
Wow 😢 but 😊 what an honorable and self aware man ... YNWA ... I hope the players, city and fans put all their energy into sending him off with trophies! Thanks, Jurgen ... ❤
If one is to have a role model, then he is mine! Thank you Jurgen, for being a great man and bringing us so much joy and emotions! A true legend whose legacy will live forever in Liverpool and football lore! What a great great man!
Klopp legend ❤️YNWA
Not a Liverpool fan but he  had made history with Liverpool he  won them their first premier League title and created players like created players like salah, , van dijk and alisson which are  the best player in the world he is  irreplaceable❤😢    We will miss u ❤🥺
I already know I will not handle the loss well come May. This is absolutely devastating.
speechless and heart broken, take care when you go jurgen, we will eternly be in your debt, you brought the good times back to anfield, we didnt need anyone else but you, our general ouur leader, our hero, JURGEN KLOPP WE THANK AND LOVE YOU
I really feel very bad about the news that the best coach that Liverpool will ever have in his era..He was just and inspiring coach to us as fans and as well the players as well😥😥😥😥😥we will miss you I know it's early to say it but I feel just😥
His car analogy was perfect to be honest. Thank you, normal one. ❤
Bro always leaves after 7 years 😢
This is just sad 😢
💔
As a Liverpool fan from my teenage time from 2005 .. my love went to saturation point in 2014 but kloop came like fresh air , Liverpool vs Barcelona, champion league and premeiel league win are great happier moments in t ougher times
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲thanks for everything Klopp! liverpool legend forever
RESPECT.  Whenever a person has the ability to realise that they can't perform to their best and they take a decision to step away from that position without any pressure, then that's the sign of real passion and love. He truly believes that he would be hampering the club if he stayed on, and the love and passion he has for Liverpool won't allow him to do this.
Noooo!!!!! Liverpool might be my most hated club but Klopp...we love Klopp...managing other team yess but retire noo
NOOOOO💔
Next German National coach. Watch out for him he’s gonna win it all
From a Sunderland  fan , that guy is amazing , both for the job he has done for Liverpool, and just as important the honesty and respect this interview gives the fans , something that is sadly lacking at our club , total respect  for Jurgen ! Best wishes
Why I wake up today?!? 😢😢
Bad news for all Liverpool fans
Im soo emotional right now....I can only imagine the pressure that comes with the Job.. Mans just trying to Live and Enjoy the Rest of His life... Thank you, Klopp!!!.. Your Name will be honored long after We are gone... Beautiful Wins, Beautiful memories for us and our families as we watched the games.. You will be missed!!! Long Live Sir Klopp!!!! ❤❤‍🩹
I’m absolutely gutted about this. He is Liverpool to me. So grateful to him for all he’s done and what he’s helped create. Damn….
I'm devastated and broken. But wait, Klopp has been so magnificent for us in the past years. The memories still lingers and unforgettable.   Jurgen I admire your personality,  the energy and the rivalries you brought to EPL, Liverpool. I'll definitely miss your fist pumps that often stir up the fans, I hope the next manager continues with fist pumps. How amazing has your time with Liverpool turned out to be. You're such a stunning figure to admire always.
Sir Jurgen Klopp. Thankyou for the memories. You are a very special human, I cant lie when i say YOU WILL BE MISSED. But this is Liverpool fc. You will go down in our history books like the very few before you that made such a difference. I hope your humility and desire live on after you leave. God bless you and your family. Good luck. ❤ But for now , COME ON YOU REDMEN. Lets do it for the gaffer,lets do it for our club.
Pep singed a Two Year deal in 2023 until 2025 Man City are laughing
Honestly, I'm broken by this decision. However, JK will always be Red. ❤
Isnt that related to the injury of mo salah ?
Dear Jürgen, thank you for your wonderful work, all the best for the future.
All the liverpool fans crying give it a season he will be at madrid lol wheels will fall off now hes going
Congratulations to Bayern Munich next season
😢
Actually crying. Feels like breaking with the best partner you’ve ever had.
As far as I know, you are the one who impressed my mind and my heart as a human, and not having you around is something I can't handle honestly.. that's because of your impact and your being.ove and respect JK ❤️😢
It’s  💔 for the team Klopp always a legend
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
So when do we rename our famous stand: the Jurgen Kop?
Massive Massive respect for this man from an Arsenal Fan. This guy changed liverpool into the power house they have become..what a character, what a man and what a great human being. Going to be missed
I am sad about this news, but i kinda had a feeling about it would was around the corner that this news would happen. I only have love and respect for Jürgen and what he did for the club i love.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING 😢😢😢😢🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
One the greatest managers in the word .You succeeded with Dortmund and Liverpool etc .Thank you Klopp for Everything. YNWA❤
I'm crying 😢
is there any liverpool fan who watched it full but still not crying. I don't know if there will ever be any better manager. Liverpool is blessed. This whole town is blessed. tears in my eyes, my heart is Bleeding. i loved this man a lot and now all I have is a broken heart
I will watch every minute like its the last football footage 😢
respect to you  Klopp don"t forget you are the best and you are in pur hearts forever
💔💔💔💔😞😞😞😞😞
Saya mungkin hanya penikmat layar kaca, tapi saya mencintai klub ini sejak 17 tahun yang lalu Tahun-tahun bersama Klopp sangat menyenangkan, saya pernah menangis sedih dan menangis bahagia di era Klopp Saya bangga tim kesayangan saya pernah dilatih oleh Jurgen Klopp Terimakasih Legend Kami berharap patungmu akan secepatnya dibuat di depan Anfield
it's a sad day for the fans
🥺
I am a big JÜRGEN KLOPP FAN. Just in Case i am a Schalke Fan since my 1st year in the world. But i Loved this man as a Trainer of Borussia Dortmund. And i thouht that His cancelling in Dortmund would be a Statement. But this ist a Monument Statement! HE IS THESE CHARAKTER THAT NOW ONE HAVE ANYMORE. he give EVERY Fan of His own or His opponement Fan making Them cry. He IS THESE Kind of Type that make the world a good lucky world. Because he IS only taking the Truth making it to the middle Point and His Not making any shame to think better. No ist only the Truth. I Love These Guy even he IS Training Always the wrong Team. I Wish him all good in the world and he Comeback soon Sure Stranger better and WE all can Hope there will BE more people Like him... Thx Jürgen to be the best person U r and the Maximum of beein the best Trainer for us the fans... God bless u and ur Family.
Jurgen - I, like everyone, am shocked and gutted at this news, but even in this situation, your grace and quality as a top human being comes through in spades.  We love you.  We will miss you.  But we understand what you need to do for yourself.  Everything except your words on not trying every match for you.  Every LFC fan and player is going to will a championship over the line FOR YOU.  You are simply the best ❤
Thank you Klopp. As a Liverpool fans, I really enjoyed watching in these years.
Best of luck to you Klopp ❤
Thank you Jurgen. Thank you for your sacrifice over these years. You are a legend and will never be forgotten.
I'm not Happy at all.  Completely ruined my whole year and it's only January.  😢😢😢😢
NOOOOOOOOOOOO T-T
Typical of this man - open, honest, truthful. YNWA.
Arsenal fan and wished we signed him before Liverpool did. Massive loss for Liverpool and for the prem.
So sadd :((((
It was always going to happen…but just not now! Absolutely gutted,Liverpool’s greatest manager and even better human being. What a legacy.
Good luck klopp ❤ The best coach in the world ❤😢
You wil never replace jurgen Klopp 😢
i love u ,always i'll support you.
It is worse than when I heard of the news in 1991 when King Kenny was leaving. I am finding it very hard to accept and process at this stage.
It’s hard to accept, but I understand and fully support Klopp. As someone who watched Liverpool all the way from the Philippines, he amazed me both as a manager and a human being. The way that he connected with the people, the players, the staff. He is everything that I wanted in a manager. And I’m glad we made memories with him.  Hoping for a beautiful end to this season!
1st of april came early 😢
What a gentleman, what a way to quit job you love. Greetings to this Mister and all Liverpool fans from Serbia.
Thank you and you will be missed in the sidelines.
As a Man City fan, you will be missed, Jurgen. 🫡
We love you Jurgen let’s go and cherish are last moments together
Devastated that he's leaving but he's done the right thing coming forward to say he's not 100% to manage the club. I mean these days managers come and go, straight up sacked 90% of the time and then just forgotten about the day after. The fact that he's able to be given this opportunity to reach out to the fans and explain why he's leaving is rare.  After everything he's done for us and the clubs he's managed before over the years he deserves to rest and to enjoy some free time with his family.  Jurgen thank you for everything, I'm glad I was able to understand why you have to this. You're a legend and you'll never walk alone.
We love you Kloppo
Jürgen Klopp is a fucking legend to the club, what he did for this football club is incredible.
Klopp is a class act. The EPL and world football will miss him until he steps back on the pitch after this season.
Words cannot express how much I value Jurgen as our Red Honourary Scouse Manager. He is the best thing to happen to Liverpool in a long, long while, and I say this with the greatest respect for Rafa, Kenny, the late great Houllier, and other managers from my time. Danke, Jurgen. YNWA
So he could come back ????
The worst feeling that I haven't  watched this man at Anfield since he's been boss. May just have to buy one of those £500+ tickets and attend
good news
He will be missed ...long live Klopp...
Next season Liverpool will be back to average sitting in 10th place 😂
I was never ready for this. Jürgen..man, what a guy and what a manager
Let’s win the fucking lot ! Up the reds 💪🏻👊🏻
Klopp isnt just a Liverpool Legend hes a Premier League and football Legend
Klopp will always be Liverpool love you boss enjoy whatever you do I love you ❤
We miss u boss
welcome to munich jürgen mia san mia
as a liverpool fan i can say that , to young kids he is  like a grand dad , to people of my age he is like a father figure , to people just younger to him hes like a elder brother and to people older to him he feels like a son or a younger brother . what i mean is , no matter where you are either in liverpool , in europe , in asia , north south america , oceanic region , even antatica or even there is a person who is in space , klopp makes you feel like he is your pal. hes a guy whom you can meet for the first time and still it might feel like as if he is someone you have known for years. Thank you for everything kloppo , forever a red
You will be sorely missed BOSS, devastated is an understatement, but I knew this time would eventually come. Hoped it wouldn't be for a good few years to be honest, but understand that you're ready to spend time with his family! You deserve it, your family deserves it... Thank you for all you've done, and hopefully will continue to do this year! YNWA, ever! ♥💔
I’m  crying
Irreplaceable
Even an announcement of his decision to leave could still sound so inspiring. We are all lucky to have him in our lives, as supporters of LFC, as fans of sports and as a fellow human being. Jurgen, you are a good person who has done wonderful things affecting many people. Sad to see you leave but happy to know that you find that life has many more unexplored situations which you hope to discover and experience. We will be happy for you. To many great days. You'll Never Walk Alone.
💔💔😭Honestly heartbroken and one of the saddest days. He truly the human personification of the heartbeat and soul of the club. However bigger than all the successes and honors. As a human, the normal guy he is a role model and figure we aspire to. Love this man as if he was family and he will never know who I am. Love you Jurgan YNWA
I am not OKAY i will miss this guy too much i can’t i just can’t   Thank you Klopp for everything
Good luck to him, nobody could knock his achievements
Arsenal fan here, absolutely shocked to hear that Klopp is leaving end of the season. Even if you don't support Liverpool you have to respect what Klopp has done at the club. He took over what was a poor Liverpool team, made his own signings, competed with Pep and won every trophy.  I'm surprised that he announced it during the season it will be interesting to see what effect itv has on the team for rest of the season.  Also I'm intrigued to see who they will bring in to replace him as Liverpool went through many years of bad managers before bringing  in Klopp. It is difficult to find managers that can install the winners mentality in the team time will tell if Liverpool can continue being a dominant team or will they go through a few years of decline.
As a United fan, big respect for Klopp and LFC. Great manager. Wish him all the best!
The only positive I can gather from this is that he could've left last year. An ageing core, poor season. He didn't. He did the hardest part of rebuilding the team, core of young stars all around. And him leaving is not just fear of what'll happen to pool, it's just saddness of not seeing him around, not having him in the dugout. A bit like a breakup!
This has to be one of my biggest shock in the world of football
Arsenal fan here….  This is a classy interview by a good interviewer and class act in Jürgen Klopp.  It’s a sad day for all football fans, Jürgen, is an icon and a legend, he will be missed!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 Ливерпуль сдуется.
Pep’s done him lol.
I can't believe that klop will live us, thx for everything Mr. We Will miss u 😢😢
YNWA...in Klopp we will always trust...
You, more than anyone else, deserve a normal life, you f***ing legend ! We love you ! YNWA !
I so,so, sorry to hear Liverpool would not be the same without Jurgen Kloop, but l respect his decision and we will be eternally grateful for his immense contribution to FOOTBALL in general.
Heartbroken
As an Arsenal fan, I've never respected a coach more than Jurgen Klopp.  When Arsenal weren't able to win something, I'd find myself blatantly rooting for him and Liverpool to do well because they deserved it, because he deserved it.  What a legend.
Farewell The GOAT 🐐 Manager YNWA Appreciated bout your work to build my fav team football since my teenage like this WORLD CLASS LIVERPOOL
Damn bro :(, we gotta go win it all now! End this season with a bang😭
🎉❤❤❤❤massive miss klopp he burnt ! out need time out family life😊😊
Even as a united fan .I'd would be kind of sad to see him go. I would rather beat him than be saying maybe we have a chance now.
We see the rising and falling of many kings, the falling of Anfield is here 😂
I'm shocked and saddened, I was dreading this day that I knew it will happen at one point, I just hope we push on to the limit this season, Thank you Kloppo
You make more money in a half a year than I make in a lifetime. I admire you Klopp and YWNWA, but if you can't stand the heat...
The best 9 years i enjoy watching LIV.
Good lad and absolute legend at the same time.  Same row with Gerard Lets see some heavy metal as a last dance on the pitch🤘 Danke Jürgen YNWA!
😭😭😭😭😭 don't leave klopp sir
Legend 💔
😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥳
I'm watching this and from half way I'm crying like a baby...😢 Thanks man❤
"From doubters to believers". That will always be his unforgetable call-to-arms. Thank you for being one of the greatest human beings I have ever seen.
As a Man City fan, I  admire him and his relationship with the player.
I was lessening to his news many videos about him... its a shock.... i can hear is sadness... we wish him good luck❤
You won't see anything more honest and heartfelt than this ...
YNWA JÜNGER KLOPP
Thank You Coach 😟
Maybe he will be back in some years?
Gidiyor gonlumun efendisi
So you're not the manager anymore?! Fine,  just fk off then.
Forever grateful for the competition and the passion you have brought through the premier league. Legend 👊
thank you
End of an Era 😥
Iam united fans,,but one thing that i really respect for klopp n liverpool..is this man and club are walking together,,step by step...even when they get drop...to uel  for example,,,,i don,t hear too noisy sound from the media....and the last 4 years klopp is already build a legacy,,,from here we learn that all need time,,,liverpool give klopp option,,,space to tinking.. Finally...the farewell has come..i hope all the best for you coach...my wife will miss u...bcz she is your big fans..😢
I'm shattered. He is one of the greatest. He's has given us so much. He's brought  us glory and trophies. And look at how he reconstructed,this present team,and its the ground running. Go well, Sir. I am truly sad,but indeed very grateful. Thank you so much.
I think bayern called. He couldn't refuse the offer. He did what he promised to deliver in LFC & it's time to part ways.
I'm a Arsenal fan, I completely get how gutted Liverpool fans must be. It's not just a loss for Liverpool but for the entire league. Coaches like this force everyone to have to raise their level including rivals which is to the benefit of us all. Having said that I can get where he's coming from, all the best to you Jürgen and all the best to Liverpool going forward.
He is going to join man utd or chelsea he is taking his whole crew with him
Feels like it was just yesterday that he was appointed, he was the new hot manager and did not disappoint! He turned Liverpool into a winning team wish you the best mr klopp
😔
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I blame Brexit
Whatever club you support, you'd love to hear a manager talk about your club like this  Endless respect to this man
sir Jürgen Klopp💪
이게 진짜일리 없어
The best manager ever!  How much this man has done for us is just unbelievable  what a guy he  has turned all of our class players  into absolute  monsters  and his tactics  are just on another  level . I will miss you Klopp   your decision  is 100%   right and us Liverpool fans will never forget about you.  Ynwa  Klopp  all the best for you!
i will very much miss you have a good time in your new journey thanks for everything
sejujurnya saya adalah penggemar liverpool berawal televisi belum berwarna dinegara saya yg hanya hitam putih. diawal sanalah sy menonton liverpool vs cristal palace pertama kali. disitulah awalnya sy menjadi pendukung liverpool. semasa jurgen klop melatih liverpool , saya selalu mencari berita dan menonton liverpool dlm tayangan apa pun. tapi sekarang sy merasa sedih karena jurgen klop akan meninggalkan liverpool 😢. semoga jurgen klop dan keluarganya selalu bahagia. YNWA.
What I like and admire about Jürgen Clopp is that he’s a star maker, he has a good eye that can pick a great player with great potential before anyone else can see that. His thinking is about building a team not just buying big stars. This kind of managers is hard to find nowadays!
such a shocking news :(  you were the best part of this club :(
❤😢
Thank you Jurgen for all greate emotions you gifted to us!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations Jurgen, it's take a lot of love and respect to inform us like this.   God bless you, and by his grace, let's win the quadruplé in 2024.
Nooooo! I'm heartbroken... He's one of the best thing that ever happened to Liverpool, to Premier League, and to football world in general! Such a unique, amazing character, top manager, and an even better human being... He's giving such healing scent to the atmosphere around him.. I still can't imagine the future without him
As a City fan he made the league a better place. One of the greatest man managers in the history of the game. Will be missed.
Please come India mohunbagan super giants
Come back when you feel better Jürgen Klopp YNWA!❤
Next Germany manager if he doesnt go back to club football. Legend Thank you for everything Jurgen YNWA
Not a Liverpool fan just a neutral but Klopp the games the trophies you have won will go down in history massive lose to the club i hope you win it all this year :)
Come to Barca…
Thank you, Klopp. The best we’ve ever had. YNWA
Man city fan, im hurt
:(
He’s like a family member or an old friend that you never want to go. He is an absolute legend and a man of honesty and integrity.  Best wishes for the future Jürgen YNWA ❤️🔥❤️
He knows liverpool aint the same team they used to be
He will ne missed definitely but not forgotten  ! The humble one and also genius
I respect your decision Jurgen more blessings to. Iam so much proud of you for what you have done for me as Liverpool supporters.
I’m 47 yrs old, lifelong Liverpool supporter and you’re the greatest Liverpool manager ive ever seen! Thank you for all your, love, passion, guidance and most of all thank you for making Liverpool great again! Saying goodbye to you seems so unreal, I wish you could stay forever but we all know nothing is forever. I thank you from the bottom of my heart and I wish you and your family the very best of health and luck in whatever you guys have planned out for the future. WE WILL ALL MISS YOU, LIVERPOOL IS NOW AND FOREVER A PART OF YOU.
Man such a legend I feel so sad that he is leaving 😭
I’m a Liverpool fan from Russia, and I want to tell this man a lot of things! A plenty of moments with fluttering heart in front of the TV connected to this club. My dream was to talk to The Boss after or before the game, any of them. Now that won’t happen. The new dream - is to say “Thank you” at some point of my life, when I will meet this great person-the normal one, with normal life and endless love for football and this football club!
Amazing guy. All the best to him and Liverpool
Love for klopp is not because he is the best manager, he is inspiration, goodness within him, his honest words, he is an inspiration to humanity on how everyone should be, my heart bleeds, cannot say more, as a Liverpool fan, cannot think of anyone because he is one of a kind, God bless klopp, love him for ever, these are not words, heartfelt ❤
No way no way
No way.. i love him sooo much
Very sad and worrying for LFC fans since there are no top managers available to take over.
So spricht ein Mann, der für sich alles gewonnen hat. Der mit sich im Reinen ist. Wie sagte ein weiser Mann mal: "für einen Mann, der seinen letzten Weg beschreitet, ist ein Titel nicht wichtig."
thanks coach for the foundation you built in Liverpool,   the greatest and energetic coach of modern football era
💔💔💔💔💔the saddest day of my life
Build the Man a statue already cause he deserves it,even if u don't support liverpool i see no reason to hate this man,he's pure and real ,a rare one ❤YNWA
"I announced it now because of the same reason as Dortmund" - i.e scummy press were about to leak it...
Man deserves a statue! Amazing Human being. Turned many from doubters to believers! A great loss to the footballing world. His legacy will live on.
Love you Klopp ♥️ YNWA.
He is one of best, one of the legends, one of our greatest history. No matter where you are, you are always with us and we are with you, forever. Thank you  Jurken Klopp. ❤❤😭
Kloppo bester Mann. Komm nach Hause, du hast es dir verdient.
가야 할 때가 언제인가를 분명히 알고 가는 이의 뒷모습은 얼마나 아름다운가.  봄 한철 격정을 인내한 나의 사랑은 지고 있다.  분분한 낙화. 결별이 이룩하는 축복에 싸여 지금은 가야 할 때  무성한 녹음과 그리고 머지않아 열매 맺는 가을을 향하여  나의 청춘은 꽃답게 죽는다.  헤어지자 섬세한 손길을 흔들며 하롱하롱 꽃잎이 지는 어느 날  나의 사랑, 나의 결별 샘터에 물 고이듯 성숙하는 내 영혼의 슬픈 눈.
Oh man...
Dumbstruck and lost for words.
not a liverpool fan but felt this💔
The love I have for this man is un measureable 🫶
I am heartbroken , this man gave us the greatest years we have had as supporters in over 50 years. He made us great again after half a century of mediocrity. Hopefully he gets the rest that he deserves , the greatest ever for me , as he had to do it against so much corruption. YNWA Jürgen ♥️🙏🏼
Question is now who do we bring in now, theres no one out there right now
I hope it is not an illness that has forced him to leave. I dislike Liverpool but this sucks for them.
thank for all you have for us for all of this years.Farewell you have my respect
Aa is very sad. I did not accept this. How wonderful you are, Club. Aa. I love you
i love him he allways think outsidebox even here
I don't know what to say , really really it's like braking the bone hearing this news !!😭😭
Just build statue of this man please 😢😢😢
I couldn't deny it but you walked into my heart. Many things have changed. I don't know how to thank you. With the past, with what you did for us Let's make the rest of our days together special. I will always love you Wherever you are, you will be in my heart today and forever.  You’ll Never Walk Alone 😍😍😍❤️
YNWA ❤ KLOPP ❤ YNWA   Respect from ASTANA 🇰🇿
Legend
I'm an a Milan fan but love this coach 💯
Love you Klopp.. put in a word for Mourinho
Held it together until the end and then 😢
Devastated.
Admire the man, admire the achievements, admire the belief he gave us, admire the team he created and admire his passion He was the one, not the normal one, but THE special one.  Jürgen Klopp …. Thank you for everything YNWA 🙏🏽
Klopps last message there nearly got me feeling like I need to cheer for Liverpool before I remember I’m a United fan 😂. Sad day for Liverpool fans, respect to you guys, we had this with Sir Alex those years ago so understand what you guys must be feeling
I'm a Spurs fan of 5 years but Klopp was always my favorite manager because of the way he made Liverpool a family. This is a blow to the whole league, but the silver lining is I won't have to feel conflicted when we play you guys anymore 😂
This news is so sad 😢
Boss 😭😭😭😭😭
Oh No. Thank you for making liverpool amazing.
Thank you for everything, Jürgen.  😭😭😭❤❤❤
Give this man a standing ovation every match till end of season
He is the best thing that happened to liverpool . As a football fan not having klopp is a loss for the entire football community
YNWA❤
2024 starts so bad: Matpat leaves Game Theory, Tom Scott quits YT and Jürgen Klopp leaves Liverpool :/
I’m 56 not from Liverpool…my wonderful father worked in Runcorn. I was 5 years old and he came home with a Liverpool Everton programme…that was 1977..me and my brother Nick fell in love with the club and since then we’ve driven miles to just be part of something special….we’ve seen a lot since Mr Paisley and without any disrespect to those who followed him..This news today hurts..Feeling a bit numb and searching for the Cliched Take That helpline!!! I’m going miss this fella..bugger!!! Be happy Mr Klopp and thank you. 😢😢😢
"we are liverpool we went through harder things together" 😭😭 he will forever be in the hearts of Liverpool fans.
Klopp😢😢
MAYBE WE ARE NOT LIVERPOOL, ACTUALLY NO, WE ARE NOT, BUT IF YOU COME TO ROME YOU WILL BE LIKE MARS. JK LIKE JULIUS KAESAR.. did you know that according to tasteatlas, Rome is the city where you eat best in the world? This is also important. Do you want to train the team in the Colosseum? you can do it. E daje
Oh that is a good news so far as Man Utd fan … BUT sad actually … how can we hate this guy ❤
Flood alert on the Mersey tonight, a few tears will be shed. God bless you Jurgen Norbet Klopp, thank you for what you've done and what you'll try to achieve for the rest of the season. Every Liverpool supporters/fan loves you ❤ YNWA
Dam this is hitting me hard 😢. It’s like a family member saying they discovered they have cancer and won’t be around for long 😭 YNWA
Gutted! Let’s push on and win the league to send him off.
What a nice man! And for the English: yep, they do exist in Germany, too. So dear Mr. Klopp, have some rest and maybe we will all see you again. And thank you for the wonderful football and total honesty: 👌👍👏❤!
What a human being and completely selfless. Putting the club first, even when he knows it’s time to move on. Good luck and all the best for the future.
Danke schön Jürgen. Thank you for the memories. ❤❤❤
I’m a Manchester City supporter but have enormous respect for Jürgen. One of the greatest PL managers ever, as well as being a gentleman. A hard act to follow. Next German coach?
Jurgen in our ❤ forever !!!
I'm a rugby fan before football, and don't support Liverpool but wow what a manager he is. I would have ran through a brick wall for that man. Quality manager.
LFC must make him vice chairman on the board so his wisdom can be used to aid LFC. Klopp needs to work part time due to his GRIEF at losing his mum who was also his life guide. It can take upto 3 yrs to recover from grief.         KLOPP IS ENGLANDS NEXT BOSS & MEETS MESSI & ARGENTINA IN WORLDCUP Final 2026.             AFTER COVID family deaths & LOSING BOTH PARENTS, HE NEEDS A BREAK.        ALL ENGLAND FANS RESPECT him hugely like Sir Alf & Shanks & Busby & Fergie & Clough (even the Manc's).        99% fans want him to go out in a blaze of glory by winning Quadruple of both wembly lg & fa cups & eufa & prem champs.           Cmon LFC "destiny is calling" & no one wants the alleged FFS cheats of pep to win anything
We love you Jurgen, no matter what you'll never walk alone ❤
Thank you Klopp. You are Liverpool, and I'm glad we watched your team live in Nov 2023. It was the best decision forever.
Man I wish he could’ve had another go at the champions league 😭
Running out of energy" is the best compliment Pep and my Man City can get from Klopp...basically, we out fought and out ran him. Honestly, disappointed to see him leave as Klopp has been our only real rival - and made us a better team; As a City supporter I can say he is def worldclass and has been great manager for Liverpool.
LEGEND....YNWA
Not a Liverpool supporter, but it's easy to like and respect Klopp. A great boost to English football. I wish him all the best. ITFC.
Thank you Jurgen, for all you've done for Liverpool; the club, the people, and the fans. So much joy that so many owe to your work, and for your character. Thank you.
As a Manchester United fan  I can confidently say that Klopp has been a great servant for Liverpool. He's character is unquestionably astounding. All the best with his future ventures🎉🎉🎉❤
A amazing manager a amazing man a sad day for us fans ,the club ,the city and British football.Let's have the biggest season ever YNWA
We as a Liverpool fan we are in debut to this Man, We all Love him and will miss him, I would suggest to move him upstairs as a sporting Director with Pep as a Manager
So sad to see him leaving... All the best sir....  Hope to see the combination of Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard to be his successor.
Damn...
I feel very sorry and sad for Jurgen because he is our manager as he's done a lot for us.Also forever klopp will be in our hearts❤ wherever he goes next 😚😁
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
THX for all my NORMAL ONE ❤ we Will miss u , u deserve the best
Pep is going to feel like megamind when metro man faked his own death … it’s not fun anymore 🥲🥲
NO PLEASE! NO!🙏🙏🙏🙏 PAY THE MAN TRIPLE THE ACTUAL WAGES EVEN IF NEEDED!😡😡 BUT PLEASE, WE CANT AFFORD TO LOSE THIS MAN NOW! HE SAID HE GONE STAY TILL 2026!(IF IM CORRECT HERE).. PLEASE! THE OWNERS OR ANY PERSON WHO'S HIGHLY CONNECTED WITH LFC, PLEASE DO SOMETHING! KLOPP STILL GOT THAT FULL DETERMINATION & ENERGY AS A MANAGER! HE AINT A ROY HODSON OR A PELLEGRINI TYPE OF MANAGER THAT NO LONGER CAN COACH A BIG CLUB! HE HAS STILL SO MUCH TO OFFER! PLEASE MR KLOPP! NO! JUST NO!😢😢 PLEASE ANYONE OR SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING! IM HEARTBROKEN!  KLOPP CAN STILL GUIDE US TO TWO MORE EPL TITLES OR EVEN A UCL TROPHY! 😤😤
😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you. For everything, Jurgen.
Not just a great manager but also a great man,you will greatly be missed
Salute gaffer !
The King of Heavy Metal football bows out😢. Nothing but respect.
Next England manager?
Goat 🐐
Ynwa.. and he walked the walk. May all teams have coaches like him.. and I don't mean just soccer teams. All the best to him!
Farewell our genius ❤
Thank you mate ❤
I’m shocked and sad but I have to respect his decisions Thank you klop once a red always a red…..Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Klop Thank you 🙏
KLOPP WHAT A MANAGER MAN !!! Brought me to love the club and now I’m here to stay . Truly the end of an era and you will be remembered as Premier League and Club LEGEND ❤❤❤YNWA🫡
I believe its been a year since i last remember crying. That changed today.
Always wanted to watch Klopp's Liverpool play at Anfield. I hope I can before it's too late. We love you, Jürgen ♥️
I became a fan of him when I saw him manage Dortmund and compete with the great Bayern. When I learned he would depart Dortmund and come to Liverpool. I decided to start watching Liverpool play. That's how I fell in love with the club. The explosiveness he brought to the club no one can match.There has never been a  Liverpool without Klopp for me. This hurts much more than any player departing the club. His 24 year managerial career will be considered one of the best in the history of football. Thank you for all the memories Jurgen....
YNWA
Made us from doubters to believers. Greatest manager in the modern era ❤️
Thank you for everything Jurgen...  Liverpool loves you...YNWA.
legend coach i’m so glad that Jurgen is a Red🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Shocked!😢❤😢❤😢
Mr    jurgen klopp  why now 😂😂😂
Huge respect..... We have to accept it because it is how life works... Gonna miss you after this season. YNWA😢 Thank you so much for all these beautiful years 🙏 you are a genius...
Legendary coach. We celebrate everything about you Koop. This is the way to leave. Looking forward to honoring you properly.
im going to cry, he was by far my favourite manager 😭😭😭
“I’m leaving” 😧😭noooooooo  “For at least a year. May come back and only for Liverpool” 🥲🥹 ok steady lads
I'm a Man City fan, but this news of Kloop learning Liverpool  makes me sad. I feel like losing Pep @city. Can't see Liverpool without this man.
He dont love use anymore 😣😣
One of the greatest mangers of all time, we will miss you Jürgen.
Wonderful man who made such an impact on an amazing club.
YNWA
Klopp is irreplaceable, if he takes some higher level Job with Liverpool and stay would be much better for the club
Mr    jurgen klopp  why now 😂😂😂
😢😢😢😢
What a guy ❤ un replaceable 🐐
Im looking forward to Peps genuine reaction
Shades of Dalglish 91,hope the club do the sensible thing they should have back then and say take a year to recharge Gaffa and then come home to go again. Pep and Co could easily hold ship for a season if backed by the club and keep continuity going without destroying everything built the last 8-9 years overnight. This would be the most diligent thing to do, Pep took a year off before City didn't he
Phil jackson made the decision to tell his players it was his last season, he called it the last dance. worked out well for him
Man I'm not getting used to this...Emotions are running high
I am a Manchester City fan, but I am going to miss him at the helm of Liverpool.   He managed to create an immensely powerful and dangerous team on a shoestring budget.   I have nothing but respect for Herr Klopp. YNWA
Wow...it was just a few days ago that I thought, "It's gonna be 10 years next year since Klopp arrived... he'll probably leave then". Never thought it would happen now :(
As a United fan, I am heartbroken.
Jurgen Klopp leaving before we get gta 6!! Class manager   YNWA 🔴🔴
He had enough being a loser, working for Looooooooooooooserpoooooooooooooool!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thanks for everything Jürgen. We'll meet again, dunno where dunno when.
Klopp has improved so much over his tenure, he will be missed well and truly by not just Liverpool fans - but fans around the world who recognize his success.   A legend of the game <3 - Happy Retirement bigman.
This is the biggest non family related pain I’ve ever felt. Jurgen Klopp you are Mr Liverpool, forever. YNWA ❤️💔
This was a wrong time to reveal this, this might affect the team's performance lately.
What a shock news! I am just infinitely sad. But I still have the utmost respect for his decision. And also that it was made in time for the club to react appropriately. I now wish us the championship with all my heart even more than I already do. Because that would be exactly the gift that Kloppo deserves after all that he and his team have achieved for LFC and will certainly continue to achieve until the end of the season.
Danke Jürgen .
if any possibility in the future the he could comeback even if it small then he has to. He gave the team so much energy even us the supporter. May his decision will give the lads energy to win something for him....😥
If this ain't a smart man that calms you when he tells you bad news.....I don't know who is
Sepertinya musim depan era  "City-Pool" Tidak seru seperti yang lalu² :(
❤❤❤...YNWA Jürgen Klopp!
💔💔💔💔💔😭😭😭
As a utd fan i actually feel a bit of sorrow, he's a likeable guy
Barcelona is calling... 🙁
Thank you Jurgen for wonderful job you have done for me as Liverpool  Man
He got burned out 😢 I know that feeling…. The pay can be good, the job can be ok.. but you just don’t see your self doing it anymore 🥺🥺
Why am I crying
Please don’t retire:(
As a West Brom fan I am sorry that Jurgen has made this decision, however you have to respect his honesty here.  Great man and a great manager. Best wishes to him with regards to his future personal and professional life. Liverpool fans -  Do not be sad that he is leaving, smile and remember what he has done for your wonderful football club.
😭😭😭😭
The sad thing no one can replace his level of management at the moment! Not many great managers on his level at the moment unfortunately.  Liverpool will struggle without him...Much love Klopp YNWA. Sad day hearing this!
Has the covid jab sapped his energy
감사합니다 감독님
i can not say how much i respect and admire this german gentleman. all the moments he gave us in PL, the way he shaped Liverpool, and the legend of a coach he has become. hats off to one of the best the PL have seen in decades.  from a Chelsea-fan.
"It's not important what people think what you come in, it's what people think when you leave" Danke Jurgen! We love you Boss!
This really sad, Klopp has been an amazing part of the club and made so many happy memories with the club, we will miss you jurgen Klopp ❤
Am sad I can’t stop crying 😢
Total respect to this man, he’s the best and I thank him for the joy he’s brought
I was here, on Friday 26th January 2024.
We love you forever Jurgen ❤
Thank you so much Jurgen, for everything, I hope you get what you truly desire after the season, , I know our supporters  will relish the rest of the season knowing this will be last time having you as the Manager, you are amazing man with a truly amazing character and will be truly missed, thank you again so much. Much Love Jurgen.
As an Arsenal fan, it's feels like Wenger leaving back then. Klopp has made such a big impact on Liverpool, and he's a really likeable and, from the interviews I've seen, an honest and open person.  I really respect him and the values of Liverpool, hope you guys can get a good replacement. I think it shows how much people like and respect him, when other fans are sad seeing him leave.
It is hard to accept that Jurgen will leave Liverpool 😔
as a city fan i will always miss klopp..the rivalry was so competetive..will miss you jurgen..good luck
🥹😢Man U not me team coach I’m a Chelsea fan . Klopp u make me feel bad stay please 🙏🏽 u the best in the premier league 🥇🏆

no words, its so hard, just can't swallow it, but thanks Jurgen we love you, memories will be there forever...ynwa Boss
Enjoy your live and to escape your wife go play Golf and once or twice a year come  back home and enjoy a Liverpool football match.
Heartbroken is an understatement. I was hoping this moment would never come. Heartbroken.
มีเริ่มต้น  ก็มีการผจญภัย  มีความสุขและความทุกข์  ประสพความสำเร็จและไม่ประสพความสำเร็จ  ตามเส้นทางของบุคคล  แล้วเมื่่อถึงเวลาก็ต้องจากลา เป็นธรรมดาของชีวิต  จงยอมรับการเปลี่ยนแปลงที่จะเกิดขึ้นในอนาคต  จงใช้ชีวิตอยู่กับปัจจุบันอย่างมี   สติและปัญญา  เพราะคุณจะไม่เดินเดียวดาย   “ทีมนี้ที่รัก  ลิเวอร์พูล”
As a man utd fan I'm happy but as a football fan I'm upset such a great manager the pl will miss you
The best good bye gift is winning the league
Sad day to know this, shocking for all, but the love for this man. He really needs the break. If we look thru from the old videos compare to how he carry himself back then with liverpool ,full of energy but now,, right from previous season ,he looks drain and tired. We are human afterall.. I remember during covid he does mention something like we have to take care of each other and there are much more important in life other than football. So have to respect his decision. Thank you Klopp.Thank you for everything.
I’d dreamed many things about liverpool under you. Now i’m little sad but i wish you all the best. I am far from England but I was happy because of your effort for this club.
Same season sporting director resigns, the coaching staff as well..... there's a big problem with the Fenway sports group.
Why i have the feeling that he will come back at latest in 10 years 🤔
Thanks for all the moments, Klopp! The Liverpool’s fanbase from Brazil loves you! Idol!
How can you mend a broken heart 💔😢
i will always respect your decision. this was unexpected but you will never be forgotten for the past years. YNWA
I am not a liverpool fan but I love klopp, ever since he was at Dortmund.  I hope he has the time to enjoy life with his family and immense joy.  Only happiness is what I wish for him.
The king is abdicating his throne….. but he will always be the king , thank you so much for everything you have done , a legend , a gentleman, a genius . You transformed us , you will never be forgotten and you are a gentleman
Nothing but respect for Jurgen Klopp, I have been a city fan for quite some time and I can honestly say this man has been the most terrifying coach to play against in the premier league. Any time him and his team had to play us he was terrifying. 😂 Thank you Kloop for such a great rivalry over these past years. ♥️💙
I honestly cannot believe this news, but I think he deserves to leave on his terms…..  He deserves the best send off from us and he deserves Anfield to be a fortress for the rest of the season!   Thank you Jurgen for everything!!   YNWA!!!!💔😔😢
What a Legend! From a Mancunian and a lifelong MUFC fan.
We’ll miss you Klopp YNWA ❤
I'm absolutely SPEECHLESS. Completely out of the blue, like a dagger through the heart... More than just a manager, he will be remembered as the father figure not only for the players, but also for the fans as well (me included). For turning each and every one of us "from doubters to believers"... DANKE JURGEN... for EVERYTHING. You'll Never Walk Alone. Having said that... let's give it a right go. ONE. LAST. DANCE. Up the flippin' REDS!
Top of the World ma. But the legendary Jurgen Klopp is due a serious amount of downtime.
I hope he realises what an iconic, integral part he has been in English football...not just for Liverpool. I suspect this has been very saddening news for many UK fans.
As a ManU fan…I enjoy “Liverfool” ball game more…1-Klopp…I’m a big fan!!!
💔😢
WTH wow liverpool you guys did a HUGE mistake.
NOOOOOO😢😢😢 i lost the love of Liverpool around 2010 i felt very delusional with all Premiership football & went back to watching my local non league club & found i started enjoying my football again, when klopp came he brought back my love for Liverpool fc again & my love for him as well, i don't know who could replace klopp that's anything close to him,,,,i hope non league football is still good to watch!!!!😢
Klopp, you’ll never walk alone ❤
Pls FFG out
SIR JURGEN KLOPP
Forever legend
Sad news 😢. Thanks jürgen for your good service to the club. Good luck for your future. YNWA!!
Knew this day would come but still hard to pill to take...Wishing for a happy end for this Great coach and Great Great person.  Thank you Klopp!
YNWA...
😭😭😭😭😭
Not a Liverpool fan but Jurgen KLOPP is THE BEST
Please make his last season be a good one
Thank you for everything forever legend and thanks for the nice memories, YNWA!
AOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO VIENI ALLA ROMA DAJE CAZZO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LOVE YOU KLOPP!!!

Premiere league won’t be the same without that side line attention from klopp and pep

I am not a Liverpool fan but I love to watch their games a lot. This guy is a genius and he put a lot into this team.
Don’t leave, Klopp. Don’t leave me,Klopp.
You will go but not to be forgotten. You Will Never Walk Alone.
We love u jurgen all best wishes ....u ll be missed and remembered for ever❤
Spurs fan but the prem won't be the same without him
YNWA
I knew this day would come
I’m heart broken. 💔 I wish him and his family only the best.
Very sad day for us Liverpool fans. But Jurgen is going down as one of our greatest ever managers. His passion and loyalty for our great club and the city has been incredible, he brought the good times back to Anfield. It’ll be hard to find another like him. He really deserves his rest and time away. YNWA
sad day but thanks for the memories!!!
We love you Jurgen thank you for everything YNWA
Im crying
You are an incredible honest a lionheart MAN !!! I will never forget you. This Sport as whole Will never forget you. Liverpool fc is your home for Ever !!!!!
for real...not me seeing this and felt like crying, we love you legend
This man deserves a statue
He is joining the new Manchester United Revolution in the summer🎉
Im about to witness a milestone in era.😢 Anyway, please win the Premier League championship, absolutely.
Have a year sabbatical, come back after that. Please reconsider!
This may be Klopp's most impressive interview yet. Astounding. What. A. Guy.
We will forever remember you in our hearts,safe journey God bless you Kloop❤
Is this plan is 2.0 ? 😢😢
Having watched the interview...Jurgen looks to be emotionally drained .having made this decision behind closed doors last November....hopefully now this announcement is finally out in the open & off his chest ...he can now concentrate 100% on gaining a fantastic finish to his last season with the Reds. 👏👏👏👏🏆 🏆 🏆  🏆 Y.N.W.A .
YNWA <3
THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO THIS CLUB, ALL THE BEST JURGEN. YOULL NEVER WALK ALONE
As a Liverpool fan for more than 15 years now, I am overwhelmed with love and gratitude to Jürgen and I will always be, because he made my beloved club even better than it was when I started to watch every game long time ago. I want to emphasize to everyone reading this that this is an example of pure decency and transparency of an outstanding manager and a person. I would be absolutely happy if I had a father or a boss at work like Jürgen Klopp - noble, passionate, smart, loyal, he really teaches all of us to be such a great human being. I am thankful for everything Mr. Klopp, I will never forget what you've done for all of us over the years and, of course, YNWA❤
I'm not ready for this kloop plz don't 😢😢
End of an era. Need to bring in Big Ange.
Take me back to the night we met💔
Wow that first statement.  Heavy
I feel for the next manager.
Thanks Jurgen. YNWA
Hard act to follow will be much missed by the club and my City …a true legend and a lovely soul …I think he may end up managing German National team….Either his 2nd in charge gets the job or it’s Xabi Alonso …either way it’s continuity in the way Liverpool use to do things .
As a Liverpool fan, I felt very sad when he told this news. Anyway, thank you for leading Liverpool to become the top team in Europe over the years, GOODBYE KLOPP❤️
Thank you for everything you have done for the club Jürgen! YNWA
Am in a state of shock. What can I say. I knew it will come to end one day but did not expect now. Thank you for everything. Who takes Over?
Esto duele demasiado aún no puedo
oh my god he was shoked the moment he heard this news jugen klopp is a good man may he live long and be healthy love you so much you are a pure hearted person thank you❤❤😢
Unforgettable career until now, so sad to see and hear this, but damn he deserved a break. Much love for this Kloppo! 💜
I get it, he's just tired of everything and wants a break. Take a break sir and sincerely come back 🫡
The BEST manager in The Premier League. Better than Pep with what he has,  Pep has all the resaurces,but Klopp still do better with what he don't have. "The measure of who we are, is what we do with what we have" Klopp ✊✊✊
lloré estoy llorando y voy a llorar
Gutted
Welcome to Real Madrid JK
😢😢😢
Damn
Thank you Jurgen
Can't stop crying. .....This is how you sign off though, on your own terms, now every game will be so emotional And personally, thank you for making me love football.
love this man ❤
Would be Nice from the interviewer to ask him what kind of things he would like to live as the normal life he mentioned about. Was a pretty strong statement when he said he Said “I just dont know” how its to have a normal life . Could be many different things, like go fishing, travelling, making a cook course and so on.
Moments you created will never be forgotten
Better to leave in time
I have so much respect for this brilliant and caring man. He has pushed my club to the absolute limit and given the league some of the best football ever played. Liverpool will not be the same without him. I wonder how it has affected their title charge knowing he will leave since November, it’s no wonder they are top of the league right now. All the best to Jurgen and his family
I'm not a Liverpool fan , but I understand the why he's leaving Liverpool. I worked in a job for 30 years and I thought I would keep going, but one day I knew it was time to retire and go and enjoy the rest of my life. I wish you the best Jugen .
Thank you Jurgen, we really feel that you are close to us, I'm sure that many many Liverpool's fans now are overcoming their tears 🥺   You are an amazing guy, we'll never forget you ❤
come to man utd
This is in a way good for players, because it can motivate them to win everything this year (for Jurgen).
떠나지마세요 제발 다시 생각해주세요
Club legend! We love you and fully support your decision ❤️
I’m a Millwall fan so I know bugger all about football but I do know a bit about what it takes to be a good bloke. This guy has it in spades; integrity, respect, honesty, graft and kindness. I rate this chap really highly. Yes he’s a millionaire- so what? So are many of the other people in football. But this guy has what these people lack - the willingness to engage with and understand the ordinary fans. I will miss his good grace and good humour. His magnetism and inspirational leadership and strategic ability will also be greatly missed, especially in Liverpool FC of course   God bless you Jurgen. One of the most genuine people in football 🙏👏👏♥️♥️
The man needs a rest to enjoy his life with his family fairplay to klopp
Great manager, even greater as a human being
Man Utd fan here. Respect. 😢
Thanks man
He will replace kim pan gon
No explanation necessary  You’ve excelled and we are thankful  Look after yourself  As you say “we are in a good place right now”
He came he saw he conquered. YNWA❤
This is devastating..Am I dreaming this.
thank you for everything Jürgen! YNWA ❤  we will win everything this season. the new invincibles. lets go!
Bring xabi alonso please <3
Rumours going around he’s off to Arsenal
As Manchester United fan since I was 8 years of age in 1956 I have watched so great teams and appreciated some great managers and Jorgen Klopp as been one of the best.What ever he does next I wish him the very best for the future.
its going to be emotional. good things have to come to an end. YNWA. Love you forever !!
😢😢😢😢😢
Jürgen Klopp deserves a statue in front of "Anfield"
jürgen. 2nd to none.
I was dreading this day since that day when you said you were the Normal One. I knew it immediately that you were not. Thank you for everything.
Your contribution to the club has been immeasurable. YWNA Jurgen!
Why is this hitting me like a girlfriend leaving... I hear the words...  but I just don't understand why?
Pep must be leaving as well , then it becomes a famers league
We will always remember you ❤
Is Klopp burnt out? My heart goes out to you Jurgen. You've been a great manager for Liverpool. And a much better human being for all of us. Thank you so much for EVERYTHING you've done.
At least we now have the name for the new stand…
NOOOOOOOOO 😢😢😢💔💔💔
Now i am also scared for Salah
আমি ফুটমব এ ২/২.৫ ঘণ্টা আগে দেখসি! কিন্তু ক্লপ এর পরে কাকে সিলেক্ট করবে সেইটা হইলো বিষয়। এক সিটি ছাড়া বাকি সব ক্লাবেই তো ভেজাল হইতেছে! সাপোর্টার রা চায় এক, ম্যানেজার চায় আরেকটা, স্পোর্টিং ডিরেক্টর চায় আরেকটা, সিইও আর মালিক রা চায় আরেকটা! এমন কি এই সব বিষয় টাকার সাথেও ব্যালেন্স তো ক্লপ ছাড়া এই মার্কেটে অন্য কেউ বছরের পর বছর করতেছে না। লীগ জিততে হইলে এইবার এর না হইলে আবার কবে সেইটা অনুমান করার ও সাহস হইতেছে না ক্লপ ছাড়া!  তবে ২০১৪-১৫ থেইকা আজ পর্যন্ত, লিভারপুল নিয়ে আমাদের যত ধরনের আনন্দের উপলক্ষ হইসে তার জন্য আমরা ক্লপ এর কাছে আমৃত্যু কৃতজ্ঞ। 😇
This is a really sad day!!!.. I always feared that someday this might happen and it would hurt but this is happening so soon making this somehow even hurting more. He is Mr. Liverpool, he is Liverpool. His departure is feeling like the Father of the Club is leaving, we are Liverpool and he is our father, this feels like I am becoming an orphan. Liverpool as club feels like an orphan
Klopp to madrid??
Gutted....this feels like when King Kenny left first time around  💔
Jürgen...Liverpool...Liverpool... über alles
Absolutely gutted when I heard the news, but I understand why he needed to leave. Hope Klopp can get a good nice rest and holiday with the family after the season ends. It was an honour to spend the last 9 years together. Good things come to an end, but those memories will be forever. Thank you once again, You will never walk alone.
The reason I started supporting Liverpool is because of this man klopp all the best for the future
You will never walk alone Jurgen.  Greatest manager of Liverpool in our generation. Hopefully title and cup before end of season.  Thank you Kloop.
Come back to Dortmund, please!
Thank you Klopp 4 all the memories fan and banta
LEGEND!!!
I am a German. I can understand and respect his decision. I feel very sorry for the great LFC fans. He was our best ambassador ever in England and I am very proud of him because he brought a better image of the Germans in England. Thank you Jürgen  and all the best for you and your family. I think he became a real scouser.
Absolute total respect 🙏
Noooo we gonna miss you😭
I'll always love this man forever, my gaffer! <3
Mancunian United fan here, have nothing but respect for Klopp he's been great for the premier league. Shocked at this news.
I’ve been asking myself for the past two months when is going to get a break and be with his family. I’m crying as I type this thinking of all the memories I’ve had during his time at the club and how much respect I have for him. Thank you Jurgen for doing the right thing by being honest and letting the club transition. I accept your decision wholeheartedly and am really excited for the remainder of the season! YNWA
Much love to our boss, i‘m so glad that Jürgen is a red! ❤
I’m gutted…but this man’s honesty teaches us all a lesson. Be happy Mr Klopp. xxxx
No im crying this is the best manager ever i love klopp ywnwa
Lolllllll
I don’t want him to leave he was such a legend bought players and turned them into a star ⭐️ 😭
Omg I am crying
Klopp the leagend of coaching. We miss you. . Even if I’m Man City fan💔
Als Fan von Borussia Dortmund kann ich mir lebhaft vorstellen wie es sich für die Fans und den Club LFC anfühlt. Wenn einer wie er geht, fühlt es sich an als ob die Welt zusammenbricht. Es gibt keinen anderen! Keinen Besseren!
thank you once again for everything you've done. YMMD
Didn’t even bat an eye this morning on social media because I thought it was a complete joke until I saw the official Liverpool account making posts… I actually can’t believe it but thank you Jurgen for a special 8 years😭😭😭😭
Sir ,,, it is not a right time to announce,,,,,,
I crying Jurgen I crying.  It's people like you that make this sport great. I won't forget what you did for Liverpool, what you did for Borussia.  You are a legend of THIS SPORT.  Farewell, a miracle worker.
Klopp deserves a statue
When I heard I didn’t believe it until now. I hope his not medically unwell for him to leave like this. If his ok I want him at man united
WHAT A START OF THE VIDEOO😢😢
All the best for his future. Shankley, Paisley, Dalglish Rafa, and now Kloppo. Liverpools famous 5.
Der beste Trainer im Fussballzirkus !!! Großer Respekt vor dieser Entscheidung!!! u
Yoooo????? Holy. I really hope Liverpool wins the prem this season. Klopp has done an amazing job as Liverpool's manager and I would hope that the team gives him an amazing farewell gift. We'll miss you! Thanks for all your effort at the club for all these years!!
That means mo is leaving Liverpool
We love u klopp u will a ways be remembered
This man is 100% class. All the best to you, Jürgen, as you figure out and experience "normal" life.
You'll never walk alone, coach.
yo mayo Jurgen wish u all the best absolute legendary manager 🙌
❤thank you for everything
I’m gonna miss this guy so much he was a legend, hopefully, he reconsiders
Jürgen Klopp  from Arsenal fan you are wonderful manager and human being you'll be sorely missed and we love you so much with your anger in the football pitch thank you for your service from Arsenal fan we can win easily now.
Made for liverpool
Alles Gute, lieber Kloppo! Man muss wissen, wenn die richtige Zeit ist, zu gehen! Respekt!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Gutted! But he has to do what he has to do. Build a statue and put it next next BP.
He’s true and rare Gentleman in this world. Fair play to him, he’s one of the best managers in Premier League history. 👏🏽Respect from Chelsea fan.
Regardless to whether we win 4 trophies this year or zero, at the end of the season this man alone deserves a parade, for the whole fanbase to give him the best send off ever. Just like we did with the ucl, this man deserves a parade.
Pound for pound best coach in the world. I am a ManUnited fan and yet i feel sad.
I'm cry
I’m stunned and I had a good cry and am still crying.  I wish the best.  YNWA & Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
I actually feel for Liverpool fans here. Not too surprised but as he said. Too difficult to keep secret. Other than us winning. If we lose out to anyone this season I  hope it's to Liverpool (a gooner)
next stop , bayern
Gutted
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
BVB supporters as me feel you guys.... what a classy guy what a great trainer and what a great human beeing not perfect but always honest and true... wish you guys all the best for the rest of the season with him. You'll never walk alone 💛🖤❤🤍
From doubters to believers, I've applied that to every aspect of my entire life. Once a red, for ever a red. Vielen Dank für alles liebe Jürgen ❤
u r a leagend in football world ... always having some special space  for u in fans hurt..best of luck❤❤❤❤
Love you Kloppo always, a legend forever, love Australian Reds
What is the problem in Liverpool?? Plzzz dont leave us alone 😭😭
This is a wonderful example of a wise person.
Big respect, thank you Klopp. YNWA
I'm a utd fan since d early 90s this man Klopp has been legend in the premier league good luck j
Already 1 million views. Mad.
Meine Hochachtung, wenn die Energie zu Ende ist die Reißleine ziehen bevor es zu spät ist verdient meine Anerkennung auch wenn eine solche Entscheidung mit Sicherheit schwer fällt
Now we should admit this reality though it is difficult and lads need to step up this season for the perfect farewell ❤ by winning trophies
One of the saddest days in this clubs history
Thanks Jürgen give a fabulous memory to us!
Huge, huge respect for Klopp.  I’m a Sunderland fan (so what do I know about football, eh?) who has always had a soft spot for Liverpool.  Now the players need to dig deep and win the title.
Dumb before you get dumped that's why
All the best for the future. YNWA👍
What did we do to you Klopper 😢😢😢😢
Thanks Jürgen
Who will replace him ...that's the biggest question..& problem.. some players are motivated by their managers ...that motivation might hinder some Liverpool players progress when he is not at Liverpool anymore.i just felt Liverpool will become another m.united when Alex Ferguson left m.u.
Man Liverpool is Klopp and Klopp is Liverpool. Heart broken 😶😭
Its never going to be same for us liverpool fans . he was everything no one can replace you 😢 😢 thank you for everything
LEGEND BEEN AN AMAZING 8 YEARS THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING KLOPP, MY SON IS 8 YEARS OLD NOW THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING GLAD MY SON GOT TO SEE THE MAIN MAN AT THE WHEEL. YNWA LFC FOR LIFE
Back to being 5/6/7 in the league
What a manager! What a career! Liverpool could only dream of such a manager after so many years of struggling. Thank you Klopp for everything you achieved with this club. I just hope he comes back after two or three years break. He loves football too much to quit it forever.
Thank you Jurgen Klopp. What a manager. We're lucky to have you. We love your passionate style, your heavy metal football, you are absolutely class.  It will be very hard for whoever replacing you to at least on par for your achievements.  Legend.   Thank you.
Thank you everything boss. You are the main reason why Liverpool came out of the banter era. You will forever be missed. I will cherish every second from now until the end of the season.
Thank you for everything. Danke big man
ALHAMDULILAH YANIIIIITED BYE BYE
Amazing manager but time for a fresh start!
He Came, He Saw, He Conquered 😢💔
Legend and pound for pound probably the best manager in the world. What he did against the mammoth budget city had is nothing but world class! Love him to bits and I'll be following him wherever he ends up!
My god.. To be honest, this broke my heart a little bit, but Jürgen has made the right decision to stop if he's not up for it anymore. I really doubt that anyone will do it as good as he has ever. Thank you, Jürgen 🙂❤
Respect ❤ Legend
😢😢😢😢คุณเป็นโค้ชที่ผมรักมากที่สุดเท่าที่ลิเวอร์พูลเคยมีมา ผมเคยอกหักจากคูตินโญ่ ไม่นานคุณก็จากไปอีกคน มันแบบว่าชีวิตผมพังทลาย
Come to barcelona
Der nächste Bundestrainer...?
Only real great people know, whan it is the right time to go
This man will be always in our heart we love you we do❤❤
His final message really touched me. You can see how much he loves the city and the club. Pushing the fans by saying "we've been through tougher times together and you've been through tough times before me" speaks volumes ❤
Been supporting Liverpool for over 50 years and this reminds me of when shanks left. Great men both. Thank you Jurgen YNWA ♥️
Thank you for your football Mr. Klopp👑⚽️
😢😢😢😢😢
Wow he’s leaving coz he’s overrthinking
Xabi next please❤
What a man.
no man no.cant be happen bcz of you i love liverpool.❤❤😢😢😢
Отец для меня это шок я сегодня весь день на работе был сам не свой и сейчас грусть не покидает меня.Спасибо за прекрасные годы,за прекрасные эмоций,за все что ты сделал для нас!
I’m honestly so happy for him. I knew when he came that he would leave one day when the club was in a good spot. “It is more important what people think of you when you leave, than when you arrive”.   I’m sad he won’t be on the touch line next year, but so proud of him we had a manager who won everything and gets to leave in this type of standing. What a man.
A Legend shall remain a Legend and Klopp is a true Legend. But the show must go on. The game is greater than any great players, coach, manager.... Hats off Jurgen, the cool one...Cheers and best of luck for future endeavours
All the best thank you so much
Thanks for all the memories
Whaz
😢😢😢
Спасибо Юрген за команду и за всё что ты сделал!
I'm a united fan and have to say the prem will be worse off not having him managing Liverpool top class person you can see that so clearly. I'm almost sad tbh but good luck for the rest of the season 🙏🏻 I know the feeling with pressure once you've run out of steam you only have one decision to make for your own wellbeing. Good luck Jurgen
It's shocking and I'm out of words. This man gave us so much, this man makes me believe again. Thank you for everything you have gave us over the years, all the best for you and your family. YNWA Jürgen. Danke.
This is heartbreaking. Klopp was the best thing that happened to Liverpool. It's fucking sad to now watch matches knowing he won't be there next season. He's a Legend and we'll never forget the Klopp Era. YNWA.
He's tired of the 12:30 kickoffs
Brave, intelligent, emotional, respect ❤
💔
All good things come to an end. The world enjoyed his way of playing football and he deserved all the succes he had. Hope he can finish on a high this year!💪
Klopp is a great manager, he is at best the top interim manager for a top club in Europe.
Thank you so much Sir. As a Liverpool fan, I cannot say how much you being I'm our club has meant to me and I'm sure the rest of the Liverpool fan base has great love for you and for the person you are. Danke. For everything you have done for us.
Today is a sad day, feels like if someone died
He actually looks tired here, no one could say he hasn't gave everything for the club. He's going to be massively missed
He is an amazing manager and a great human being. What an honorable and classy way to handle everything. Wish you the best, Klopp.
I have class rn but I'm crying in my room
This is so sad😭😭😭😭
You've made us believe.... we're always Liverpool FC 😢 atleast one more season
In all summary there this Legend of a man sought the need for a normal life which he may has missed. So much responsibility he has held to effecting our joy as fans, it jas always been work , euphoria and spotlight. He really looks tired😢
He leaves us better than he found us! We have a young talented squad and the future is bright thanks to him ❤
He will join Germany team and that he should be
i am bored. how I can watch super match football between Mr Pep and Mr Klopp in next season
If he wants to take the next step in his career he should apply for the utd job.
End of the Era… We are going to miss you a lot 😢
Honestly the club missed a trick last year, give him a year off put pep in charge then come back next season. He's drained and you can hear it in his voice. Great great man.
As a player as a man  Thank you 😢
Best wishes Kopp ❤️ 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
Spurs fan. Defo surprised 😮  only Liverpool manager in modern time to win everything at club level and capable of ďoing it again if he stayed..  Nearly a decade managing  at one club is a great achievement especially Liverpool 👏🏿
"It's not so important what people think when you come in. It's much more important what people feel when you leave." - Jürgen Klopp in 2015 -
Get a fly rod go and fish the world, you deserve it
MAAAAAAN😢😢😢. One of the best managers in the history of the premier and Europe. All have to come to an end...
Die hard Man Utd fanhere  but still, there is still enough time for you to reconsider! The EPL wont ever be the same without you, please stay!
I am a Middlesbrough fan.  But watching this all I will say is thank you for all you brought to both Liverpool  and English  football.  I wish you well for the future. Enjoy your retirement
This is the worst piece of news 😢 as a Red
the liverpool  kids are definitely hurting rn in school
Let's hope he ends his legendary time with PL trophy. Not a liverpool fan, but I absolutely love this man.
Liverpool made it harder than it should have been.
I can't watch this interview 😢😭😭😭
Arsenal fan here, we were lucky to have Jurgen in the league. Great manager, character and ambassador for the game. Will miss him next season and looking forward to one last battle with him.
Between PGMOL, VAR, and Man City's 115 charges, can't blame anyone for running out of energy.  The man is a living legend.  Build him a statue.  YNWA Jurgen.
Klopp deserves a statue for what he has achieved for the club. He gave everything and made Liverpool the giants of Europe all over again and the champions of England and the World. He is what Liverpool is all about 😢
Scouse rats u will be mid table next season 😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉
Oh my Jurgen. You will always be in my heart❤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you for everything you've done and what you continue to do with this team! Absolute legend.
Klopp you don’t owe us an explanation. Klopp always gives 100%, if he can only give 90% that is not the Klopp we know.  “Football is the most important of the least important things.”
alles alles gute für jürgen und den club , kuss geht raus
This man got my MOTHER into Liverpool, he turned us from Doubters to Believers, he was humble and kind and energetic and I will forever cherish the moments, goals, starting XI's and trophies that this man brought to us!! We love you Klopp, u know that... But it was you who made us Love Liverpool even a little bit more, and for that, we thank you!! All the Best for the future & your family Jurgen, You'll Never Walk Alone! ❤️🔴❤️🔴❤️
I can't believe it... but I love Klopp as always. Good luck and all the best, support you forever.
😭😭😭
As a german I have to say it is sad to hear it but football is coming home.
Comming in as The Normal One and leaving as The Legendary One like he did in Mainz and Dortmund. Next Stop, Spain, Italy or National Team? I would like to recommend Xabi Alonso to be the next LFC Coach. He will fit in perfectly in my opinion
It is like pep Guardiola leaving barcelona
We need to win the league for him...❤
You don’t have to support his teams to see how unique and talented this man is
name a worse breakup ill wait!😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
From Morocco I say to you stay where you are don't go please please you're the best of the best and all people from all the world love you too much.
From the United States: I started watching watching football because of Klopp's Liverpool. It was exciting and I was instantly caught up in it. It made me feel like I did when I was a young American baseball fan watching Ken Griffey Jr in Seattle. Thanks to the City of Liverpool for being such passionate fans and creating this environment for sport. Good Luck finding another one like this guy. He's one in a million.
He is more than a coach. More like a father figure. He is exceptional leader and right on the top !! (Not talking about the football)
I’m a Celtic fan but Liverpool have always been my favourite English club. Think it’s the Irish Catholic connection. I really hope Liverpool can find someone good enough to take over. Liverpool should win the league this season, let’s hope so HH from Glasgow ☘️
This proves how stressful and time demanding a job is in today's commercial world of football
We will miss you MR LIVERPOOL LEGEND, everything of the best for you and your family.🤗🤝👊
Absolute gutted 😢
Jurgen will always be an absolute legend and will always be part of the kop and Liverpool family , huge loss for us but massive respect to him not only for all he's done for the club but also for being open and honest about leaving , best of luck YNWA
เศร้าชิบหาย สัสเอ้ยยยย
영광의 순간을 내 눈으로 직접 볼 수 있어서 좋았다. 클롭의 시대가 저무는구나.
He will become the head coach of Germany
Brighton have just started looking for the manager who will replace the manager who will replace De Zerbi 🙂
Kopped himself another job 😂
This is almost unprecedented in this social media bullshit era where everyone seems to be obsessed with projecting an image of invincibility.  Klopp is someone at the top of their game, being honest with themselves about the physiological toll stress takes on someone's wellbeing.  He might just save a few lives by doing this, as it'll inspire many people to have open an honest conversations with themselves and loved ones about their own health.  What a guy.
Am not a Liverpool fan, but still this guy is a legend
One of the best in my lifetime. As a Leeds fan I love him
A lot to say but All I can say is “THANK YOU KLOPP “
A very heavy parting talk. Jurgen has been having a lot of stresses, all could be seen during the post matches interview. At times, he looked very tiring. All the best for the temporal retiring life!
Keputusan yang membuat ku patah hati
You do not owe us anything Boss... You made us proud again, you made us dream again, you made us champions... Thanks for everything.... We love you Jurgan... And respect your decision
Thank you for everything that you gave to the club! Thank you for the memories too!
A club Legend, we'll miss you so much. But before you go, let's make these last months count aswell! YNWA You deserve a good final chapter of this fairytale at Liverpool.
With Jürgen till the end! And hoping for the final sparks
Thank You Coach 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Oh man i knew it would happen one day. Just thought maybe two more years  but well.  I hope they let him work to the end and then on the final home game do the big party.
Dear god it hurts more than a break up But thanks jurgen you made me fall in love with football with your aura and everything we will cherish this moments for the rest of our lives and once a red always a red
a role model even at the end of his time at anfield. living legend
You made me a Liverpool fan, and for the first time, my eyes are covered with tears of mixed emotion, that while you have given your all, every beautiful story must have an ending. Yours is a beautiful ending. Wishing you all that is beautiful in the next chapter of your choosing.
Normal one... we will miss u a lot😢
I'm very sad today for hearing this message from klopp I think the team  should to get up early as soon
YNWA🫶am absolutely gutted but I understand , much love To the Boss,
クロップありがとう
one of the best managers and people <3
best manager besides Pep by far good luck on your journey ❤️
Надеюсь, клуб не станет новым МЮ в плане трофеев и игры.
Klopp is not just a manager, he is family❤️😢
Thank you so much, Klopp. Will miss you.
A great man and a great manager.
Build a Klopp Stand at the Anfield ASAP.
Jurgen, We can't ever give back to you for what you did. Thank You Jurgen, and thank you for making me love Liverpool.
YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE DONKEY JÜRGEN 😢😢😢😢
Jurgen has proved year after year he makes good decisions, and he makes them with good timing.  I trust his judgement.
How will LFC cope up without this guy 😢😢😢😢
😢 I just cried a little
You’re the man Jurgen. Thank you for everything ❤
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
As a Liverpool fan, I have to say he was average, not a great coach and just disgusting human being and I am definetly not crying.
It was a sad news. I think I will stop being a Liverpool supporter. What a sad day......
Great manager and would have won more if he had the budget pep gets from Manchester United fan 👍
One of the greatest managers I know. 🎉you will be missed indeed.
Adamsın klopp, bu yıl şampiyon yapıp ayrılacaksın inşallah❤️
City fan here, I've always like Jurgen Klopp. His Dortmund side was scary and what he did with them he brought to Liverpool and made them just as scary, if not scarier! I love our rivalry and the pep/klopp rivalry that came with it. I feel lucky to have been in the time when these two managers were here. And I'm sad that he's going. I wish him nothing but the best.
Thanyou globbbbbb 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
well liverpool next season is losing  we love klopp wether you are in liverpool or not
As a Chelsea supporter, Klopp will be missed and he is one of the few rival managers I have always admired and have massive respect for...🫡
Literally the most shocking thing ive heard in 2020s era
I have started enjoying football just because of Klopp. I was a cricket fan I slowly  started enjoying the game of football and now it's an addiction. I am big Liverpool fan
Wasn't expecting this this early. He is really a club legend. Well done Klopp, you will be missed.
As A united fan Respect you sir❤️
as a Manchester united fan am shocked and  very pleased 😂😂
😭😭
thanks Boss...you are the one that makes us believe
Know it would happen someday, but still can't believe it. Thank you for everything you've done. ynwa
I will miss you man...l feel so emotional now but with a heavy heart l understand you, you deserve a rest, you have earned and l respect that
When you look in his face you can see that Jürgen is tired. So it is the right decision  to stop. This is a burn out.
30 more games...30 more Last Dances 🥲  Bloody hell that was difficult to watch 🥲🥲🥲
Priorities switch when you won everything
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I pray Liverpool win the league before he leaves & will be sadly missed.
I came Back to this Video 2 hours after watching it and this feels like a Breakup , i'm feeling the chest pain you feel when you have a breakup. what a blow 😪
After Klop Liverpool will be mid table team again 😂, great coach ,one day he will manage Greatest team Real Madrid
No glob liverpool legend nooo
Ngl he is a world class manager and the premier league needs managers like him but the great news is he’s leaving liverpool. 😊  Edit: I really hope he doesn’t win the league this year.
Klopp’s gonna be the next shankly he’s gonna leave the club in a good position for the next manager to go and win everything. Fair play Jurgen❤❤❤
As a utd fan I wish him all the best. The best league in world football will be down graded without you. Thanks JK
I love this man
Почему он уходит? Объясните, пожалуйста! Я не понимаю английский...
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
You.  Are.  The.  Best
Boss...please.💔😭
Noooo.... Please dont go
He doesnt want to end up like Wenger...exhausted, being pushed towards the exit.
Legend! You will be missed😢 YNWA
มันเกิดอะไรขึ้นคับทีมกำลังไปได้สวย😢😢😢
I will never ever managed a club in England other than Liverpool,what a statement,He will be back one day
Very upset to hear this news but will always ❤ Jurgen. I wish him a happy new adventure. Thank you Jurgen YNWA ❤
Boss why 😢. Please tell us it not true, I can't believe this sir
How will this big news and loss to us going to affect our season now can the boys keep going till the end of the season like the way they are going now and we are chasing for the title and cup finals
As an Arsenal fan I’ll be honest. I’m disappointed in him leaving! Managers like Klopp are needed in the premier league! Managers like him are needed to make the premier league competitive… So yes good luck and enjoy the rest of your life! Respect👍
Best of the best 😢
Thank you Klopp for all your hard work and your entertaining personality that made us love, Liverpool and the game. You will always be a legend in Liverpool and the premium league. I totally understand your reasons,  someone’s life goes beyond a club or a game. You should be very proud and I know you are of what you achieved you have engraved your name in this Club and in every fan heart, may God bless you and reward you with  happiness and good health in your life to come. You will be missed.
I understand his decision, but this may impact the level of the team for the rest of the season. Beyond his explanations, I think Klopp is wrong to announce it now. It is a pity because it will interrupt the process of a team that was consolidating to win the Champions League next year. If Klopp leaves a new era will begin and everything will be more difficult.
The father figure Liverpool fc needed and will always have forever 🥹
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I’m broke
The last dance of the Klopp era. YNWA
means so much to us
He'll be back one day
Gotta admire how he's taken the time to rebuild the team and leave a good base for the next manager.
United fan. He’s a legendary manager
😢😢 what !! no 😭
Even his departure is graceful.  ❤LFC,❤Klopp
🙏😘 I love you, thank you for this words and the time of your life, you gave and still give to us, who also love Fußball! Danke Kloppo 😊
Ah man it’s such a shame. I get it why he’s doing this but I’m really going to miss him. I hope Liverpool win at least one or two trophies before the end of the season.
Total respect...what you have achieved is a blessing.
Still plenty of time to change his mind. Obviously no one knows the inner workings of the man, but I can't help but think this is the wrong time for him to leave.
Thank you​ boss.​ from​ liverpool​ thailand​😢
He needs a rest...he cant keep working endless hours.
Heart is aching over here
Y.N.W.A. Klopp we are family forever , we love you and always stand with you , thank you for everything you did with us, we cry because we love you so much.
Please don’t leave I hope you’re the next Furgursion in ManUnited
Not a Liverpool fan, but klopp was one of the mangers I respected and liked to watch the most. I feel sorry for Liverpool fans but gutted for the league to loose such a good manger.
What a person...biglove
Der König ist tot. Lang lebe der König. The king is dead. Long live the king.
I think the way football is going is massive factor var is killing the game
Oh no .... Liverpool is going to suck again.
Thank you Jürgen for making me love Liverpool. YNWA❤
😢am emotional now
Klopp is one of the best. I respect him. I don't think he is retiring. I think he is going to another club where the stress is not as high.
It's not a time of leave Liverpool. Personally i am not Liverpool fans but i love his performance. Don't be leave , stay in Liverpool
So sad, but thank you for everything, Jurgen Clop. We will miss you but hope you all the best. YNWA
When the team was on it's lowest, he decided not to leave but instead he stayed and he built it back up and leave as a Victorious Hero .....🐐
Lets win this fucking league
I can’t even watch this 😢 Was not able to get through the first few minutes.
Massive respect to the man, coming from a United fan. We could only dream to have half of what Liverpool has done for the past decade.
Worst day ever klopp we all love you 😢😢 ynwa
we love you in iran
Wherever you go, I’ll support you! You are a great person and a superb manager. God bless you!
I feel like he’s saying he wants to stay but due to stingy owners I can’t keep doing this again and again and again, whilst Pep is stress free with an open check book.
The best manager in the world is klopp. People say pep guardiola... not a chance he has always had the best team, unlimited money. Klopp has had to work for it at dortmund and at Liverpool. When he goes we will struggle big time.
I am absolutely devastated over hearing this news on my way to work. Actually cried in my car before going into work. Not only are we losing the best coach to ever do it, we are losing an incredible human being. We will miss you, but thank you for everything you have done, Jurgen. YNWA <3
You are the definition of a real man, Klopp!! You will always be Liverpool!!! YNWA !!!!!!!!!!
Wow so this is what it felt like when paisley or shankly left 😢I hope r pep takes over next season and we can say we lived though the klopp years and the pep lijnders years and won everything twice 🔥YNWA🔥
WHAAAAYYY??????
Saying good bye is never easy but Klopp this as heart breaking as it is, this has got to be one of the best resignation ever perfect timing, explanation thoughtful and everything. It's just so sad to watch this even as a rival fan.
❤
The best man, the best coach! I am proud to have a tattoo of Jurgen next to my other legendary club tattoos!  Thank you! YNWA❤
😢😢😢
I'm kop, cheering from Japan. What you have brought to Liverpool and the Kop all over the world over the past 9 years will never be erased. You came to Anfield and said:  From doubters to believers  I believed in you and I believed in Liverpool. thanks so much. I'll be back at Anfield someday Please come back. I love you, Klopp
Get this man on TRT and he's got 7 more years in him!
United fan but unlike Fergie who wanted to be hated by the opposition in order to create that siege mentality, Jurgen was the opposite. Impossible not to like the man.
😢
Man I live in Brasil. I saw in the TV “Klopp leaves Liverpool “ and couldnt believe actually. I love football in general, but Liverpool always seemed to be a very special club. I was always marvelled how they could not win the PL but still produce such amazing runs in the UCL. Beside the titles there were many finals. Things that were incredible like that game against Milan or Barcelona. The players that Liverpool had and have always seemed special in my eyes, like Gerrard, Torres, Van Dijk, Salah, Arnold. And Klopp certainly has this aura too. I know when I Watch Liverpool that you can never expect any team to knock them without a big fight. Sometimes I was wondering a player and mostly of them The place I would like to see them playing would be Liverpool. If I was a player I would certainly chose a transfer to be in Liverpool coached by Klopp. So this marriage with Klopp was perfect, but like Klopp explained with all sincerity , he needs a normal life and we cannot really chose what life asks for our hearts.
Now if Pep leave Man City too, the premier league will lost the all business
😢we love you too, Klopp! YNWA❤
no😢
YNWA ❤️
This sounds like burnout but we all know how this will work out, Alonso goes from Leverkusen to Liverpool and Klopp to Bayern...Tuchel has no future there.
Not just a great loss to LFC, but a loss to the Premier League. Outstanding manager. Outstanding character, but more importantly, an outstanding human being. Thanks for fantastic memories Jurgen!
Huge respect for Klopp!! One of the greatest manager to grace the game (coming from a man united fan)
He will NEVER EVER walk alone.
NOOOOOOOO! Even as an Arsenal fan, I absolutely love Jürgen. So much respect and love for him, his craft, and his game. He will be deeply missed. I hope, that whatever he does in the future, will be right for him and will make him happy. And if maybe he decides to return one day, I'm sure we all will welcome him back with open arms into this beautiful game of football.
Jürgen I/WE LOVE you ! and obviously as a longtime LFC (50+) years LFC fan i’m GUTTED😭🥺(i’m crying now) but i respect your decision and i trust you and your family are well! that’s the MOST important thing,i can’t really 🤔 of anything else to say at this moment,except YNWA. PS i’ll save the rest for the appropriate time.
best manager of all time
no doubt Loop has made liverpool very powerful
I’m an Arsenal fan.  Klopp leaving has an impact on us all.  We have friends and family who support Liverpool.   What a man 🥺
Boss u made the stadium buzz i respect that but we will miss klopp
Jurgen Kloop thanks for everything...ynwa❤
👍 Anyway stay healthy @Jurgen klopp  ❤ANFIELD
diganle que se no se vaya porfavor :c
You Will never Walk alone..
The last 40 seconds 😭😭😭😭
What a great human being, even now,he was thinking of others around him...what a Lion..
I've been watching Liverpool for 30 years now and Klopp is easily the best thing to happen in all of that time. When he came we were languishing and I felt like we had somehow signed Messi or Ronaldo. He has completely changed everything for the club. This is a sad day but it had to happen someday. I can only say thanks for so many amazing memories and the absolute pleasure of following the team since 2015, with the constant belief that anything can happen.   So, Mr Klopp, I say thank you. I wish you and your family the very best of everything in the future. Let's go out with a bang!
Indeed, his next assignment is to take charge of the German National Team...🤣🤣🤣
Liverpool we love you. Jurgen you are our family. In a world with so few leaders that inspire confidence, Jurgen Klopp has demonstrated enormous integrity.  More than a man, he is a GIANT of a spirit. Whatever Gods are real, they will be smiling that at least one human has lived to the true potential they have created. He is an example to us all. He is especially an example, to our world leaders. Leadership is a privilege, it should be handled with the RESPONSIBILITY, love, sincerity, commitment, care, honesty and INTEGRITY of this man. Respect is earned, not assumed. Follow this mans example. He is a good man.
Klopp sempre estará em nossos corações, obrigado. 😢😢😢❤
Gutting news but understanderble ❤ once a scouser always a scouser
For me his the best coach and manger in the world ❤
Dude, this is the most heartbreaking video I have ever watched.
Honestly, this really hurts my heart 💔😢
The best thing to happen to modern Liverpool, the shoes will be too big to fill. Hopefully Xabi Alonso will consider a stint..
He looks very tired a sad day but also a day of reflection. Look at the accomplishments made us all happy. Go enjoy your family time that is very important.
What a legend!!!! Liverpool is gonna lose the best coach they had. Thank you So much for the great years......
I honestly have no idea who will suitable enough to replace him. His assistant manager maybe?
You impacted lives here in Africa 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
You impacted lives here in Africa 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Please Barcelona,  for the love of god, please sign him. Barca need a good coach like him to rebuild the squad.
pfff devasteted who we are going to bring now:((((
Mr Klopp dankie ❤ you gave us back the Liverpool we all know that it is better as it has always been...your guides was wonderful, amazing, fantastic, and loveable to be into 😊❤you the best it is , the best it was, and the best you will always be. And for that as Liverpool family we highly appreciate and respect you always and forever.
thank you jurgen,you made us champions again... always in our hearts.. YNWA!
We are Liverpool !!! Thanks for all your our legend ❤
I feel like the interviewer was asking some pretty selfish questions at times here.
As a Liverpool fan thank you for everything Jurgen klopp you got us UCLs And some titles you will never be forgotten for your work at Liverpool you will be remembered as a great great manager to Liverpool The Reds will always miss you after you go thank you for everything you have done Jurgen.
I can't get over this . I hoped he fulfilled his contract that way liverpool fans won't be stupid . Hearing him leave I so devastating.
He is gonna train Germany. That is why!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wish him all the best what an amazing human ❤️ ♥️
Jurgen 2015 - "I will take you from doubters to believers" and he has honored his words. Sports is about winning titles no doubt but one has to believe in the system even when it looks uncertain and Klopp did that to the players but importantly to us fans worldwide.
im shocked i wish him all the best what a job he has done at Liverpool an amazing man I'm speaking as a football fan
BUZZZZ OFFFFFF 🐝
Come to united brotha😢
what a guy
A really honest and good guy. Full of good thoughts.
Respect boss kloop.Let's win titles together and enjoy the final season of the best coach in Liverpool's history ❤❤❤❤
This is so sad 😢...gonna stop watching football after he leaves Liverpool.
Shocking news to wake up to! We are losing a legendary manager!! What a loss to Liverpool and the Premier League. Klopp will always remain in our hearts. What an amazing job he did at the club! An elite manager and a great human being!!
As a supporter I'm proud to have witnessed the Klopp Era. People will tell stories to their kids about this Normal Guy and the extraordinary things he did with the club. YNWA Jürgen. 👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
Goodbye Jürgen
A sad day in football 😢
He looks so tired and needs a break to spend time with his family and loved ones. He’s done his due.
My heart is crushed.
This is what it sounds like when doves cry…
United fan here. Huge respect to Klopp. What a man. He will be missed but also  somewhat delighted the genius is gone
Shankly steps down in 1974. 50 years later klopp steps down 😭😭😭
towars barca after xavi's results
Love Jurgen, dont let it be "the chosen Crazy Man one"🙏🙄💪
thank you Jurgen..you have given everything for Liverpool...liverpool=jurgen klop..jurgen klop=liverpool,😢😢😢😢  ￼
Klopp my guy...YNWA❤
thank for bringing passion
Ffs
well all miss  u klopp danke
Its crazy to think almost 10 years has passed with Jurgen in the main seat. Even though I have never met him, I like him so much, even more as a person than a coach. Will miss him dearly!
I feel like I just got broken up with 😢
We love u jurgen ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you Jürgen Klopp
Ai generated
Thank you for everything. The time  watching you was one of the most memorable part of my life that I won't forget.
30 games and 4 more titles 😭😭. YNWA Klopp
To me the best in the world ❤
I can't watch it. Please lads, win everything for this man.
Jurgen klopp. You have been the best manager Liverpool FC has ever seen. You took us from a middle class club to literally becoming champions of England and Europe. We will always remember you as rhe best manager in the prem. Goodbye klopp  Oh my God where do we start from
Please, come to Barcelona...😀😀 Next summer there will be an empty position...😄😄
Come to United Jurgen
He needs a rest. He needs to get his energy back. Accept it.
I have been heartbroken by players leaving but this just hit me in different angles. 😞😞😞 this hurts more then anything, I love this man.💔💔💔
Hi Boss, can you please just think again? can you just charge your energy only 1 season. during the rest season ask Pep Lijnders responsible role manager instead then you back to the team next season. I feels you think this is the best way of Liverpool future. but if worse, Liverpool will go to the darkness time. you might think to much about result from last season like a you not good enough growth with Liverpool future. but trust me and million peoples in the world. In condition of Liv that less money than big team. you do super fantastic job. No one can do like you Boss.  anyway, if you not change you mind to leave the club, good luck for you I will love and support you forever and you will be number 1 who I love Liverpool manager.💌💌💌💌💌💌💌💌💌
😢klopp
can't watch this interview
Keep strong for me 😢😢😢 KLOPP for the KOPS
Sorry Sir- I'm never expected and shock to live  the Club suddenly - Even I am personally Machister city fan - Even I have seen you for all your hard work to push the club in front- All the best Sir Klopp - Please take care.
PMSL no where near Citeh' success!
Tears is actually rolling out of my eyes right now, i really love this man so much.
Klopp,,is the best,,,pay the man more money,,,it's all about money,,,pay the man,,he's deserves it ,,,more pay,,,
Imagen if jose mourinho joins Liverpool next season
Can't finish the interview now. I've only watched less than five minutes of it but I can't. I'll probably return to finish the rest much later. Probably at the end of the season. A shocker.
Trust in Klopp till the end. We love you. YNWA ❤
Amazing man.
I support this team from far, in Brazil, since 2008. And i'm just i tears right now. Not only as a genius in the game, but such a humble personality. People say that after the 30's, you dont have idols anymore.. I disagree, buddy. Anfield need another statue. Thank you, Jurgen
Klopp, you deserve to try a life outside of football, we respect your decision and am truly grateful to you for what you have done for this club ❤.   You deserve a statue YNWA
He needs to rest and live. Good luck to him.  BUT… he will like Shanks regret leaving… Shanks left a team that formed the first for Bob Paisley… Klopp is like Shanks in so many ways… rebuilding the club, leaving a super team… but like Shanks it might be the next manager who reaps a decade of trophies.
HAHA
He's done GREAT for Liverpool... DANKE Jurgen
Give the man a year break let Pep Lungers take over for next season and bring back the man back after next season
Thank you Mr Kloop.....you are one of the reasons that I have grew so much love for this football club......i will so ever be grateful for what you did for this football club.......I wish you and your family well to your next journey ❤🙏.......love from South Africa 🇿🇦
Hahahahaha 😢😢😢 poor Scousers... bad thing is he's given the Berties a major boost to win another title, daft sod Klopp
Man this is heartbreaking
Klopp to real madrid
One on the best managers of all time. Left a massive impact on all of his clubs: Mainz, Dortmund, Liverpool! ❤
Im sad 💔💔💔😢
♾️
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a manager who is loved by opposition fans so much. I’m totally heartbroken but thanks for all the great memories boss. You have been exceptional ❤❤❤ YNWA
❤❤❤❤😢❤❤❤❤
THANK YOU ! ❤ YNWA 😢
💔 All the best;  you will be missed.  So much more than one of the greatest managers ❤. A wonderful leader and human being.
Possibly the greatest and most competent legendary manager of all time in terms of galvanising all players, staff and supporters.
Jurgen Klopp sitting there breaking my heart. I miss him already, 😞😞😞
thank you for everything 🙏🙏🙏
SAD SAD DAY :(
Definition of suffering from succes lmfao what a legend YNWA!!
Thank you gaffer ❤
I never post on youtube, but as a life long Red I feel that I owe it to this man just to a leave comment of appreciation for what he actually done for and with this club. He brought it back from a place where you started to doubt if we'd ever truely compete with the best again, too what we're doing now where we can compete on every front almost every season. And to have literally won every major trophy with this club is truely astounding. You put this mans name amongst the true greats to have managed at this level, there is no question about it!   It was my privilage Jürgen, to whitness what you did for our club. And to say thank you seems not enough, but thanks is all i can give. A true great, a true professional, a true Gentleman.  Thank you Jürgen, Thank you!.
This is sad news 😮😢Thanks Jürgen klopp for all the moments we shared together❤YNWA⚽
This PROVES: "F.OOTBALL isn't M.ORE important than L.IFE [& D.EATH]. R.ESPECT MR K.LOPP for Y.OUR H.ONESTY.......✍🏿
😂😂😂Liverpool gonna get delegated,Dry spell here you’ll  go 😂
Shocked, utterly shattered. Just woke up in California to this😔 I can only be thankful that he says he's healthy. Thank you Jurgen! We're so glad you're a Red! YNWA
I just got back from work, and see this. im emotinal right now cant even speak right now wow
Legend
Thanks Jurgen! You're right!
Hes on Epsteins flight log...  😅 Joking aside he's been the bedt mamager for the last decade. Hes hands down a better manager than Pep.
Thank you for everything Kloppo, my heart breaks 💔, but I respect your decision and wish you all the best for the future
Thank you for everything Klopp 👏👏👏
Wow this is shocking ! I can't imagine Liverpool being managed by anyone else - so sad for the Liverpool fans  & players ❤ he will be a huge loss as Ferguson was to man u!
💔💔💔💔
I'm the right manager Liverpool should employ after kloop. I no you won't believe right now but if Liverpool is wise they should hire me. Shalom
Thanks for bringing respect back to the club. We love ya! Build him a statue. YNWA
😢😢😢😢
He is making me cry
😢
So 😢said that you have to leave
😭😭😭 nooooo
Its the worst day
What a solid manager and human. Difficult decision but the right one. Super sad but happy for the guy. YNWA
YNWA, Klopp ❤
He will change his mind at the end of the season, i can see us winning the league and klopp saying he wants to stay.
I am just happy that both of my favourite teams (BvB/Liverpool) had the privilege to get their hands on the "lovable one" (I stole that from the comments :D).
End of an Era. YNWA Jurgen!
Man Utd are loving this 😂😂😂
I'm a United fan , and this is a huge shock to me , this guy is monster !   I hope he's not ill or anything and going before things get too bad . Very sad loss for liverpool footy club and the fans.
Liverpool is going to be a sad Liverpool without this legend 💔
I have classes rn but I'm crying in my room
Kehadiran pertama Klopp di Liverpool benar2 membangun kepercayaan saya bahwa Liverpool akan bangkit dan menampilkan hal yg berbeda. Musim2 awal memang terbilang sulit, tapi dia membuktikan bahwa seiring berjalannya waktu Klopp selalu membawa hawa positif yg akhirnya pun membawa dampak positif. Saya bangga dan merasa beruntung Liverpool pernah memiliki Klopp, belum siap untuk kehilangannya tapi saya sudah puas dengan performamu, Klopp. Terima kasih atas dedikasi yg sangat tinggi, kerja keras, semangatmu, senyummu, kedekatanmu dengan Team, tidak akan pernah saya lupakan. Terima kasih, Klopp. You'll Never Walk Alone!
As real madrid fan and as a football fan, i have nothing but respect and admiration for Klopp. The things he achieve with liverpool are reasons why he is one of the best managers ever. Rest well Jurgen!! You deserve the break!!!
he will probably have a 1-2 year break then be back at liverpool tbh
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
His reasonings are totally realistic and will be respected. Bless him ❤
Let’s win everything for Last Dance ❤️
😢😢😢😢
I like how raw and unscripted this is, he is a legend of the premier league and football itself, a huge loss but I wish you well mate ❤️
YNWA
Image they managed to win the league again on his last match after 9 year, or the euro league. What a humble and honest guy Klopp is. A fresh breeze in a reckless football world.
I started watching Liverpool in 2016. Klopp is all I know 😢 we love you boss
I’m absolutely gutted by this. He’s been the best manager since I started supporting the reds in 93. Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for the club and the fans. You’re forever a legend and will be so missed by all of us. Worst day ever! 😔
Can’t express how gutted I am, this man is a living legend
Enjoy the rest of the season Jurgen the lads will run through anything for you and thank you for what you have done for LFC and us fans you turned us from dreamers to believers , you will be sorely missed , health and happiness to you , come back and see us always welcolme x
I stopped watching football few years ago, got back last year thanks to this awesome man who brought Liverpool back to life and now I guess I will be quiting forever!!! 💔💔💔
What a bizarrre seating arrangement.
Please please please take  England job Jurgen!!!? Gotta feeling you're off to Real Madrid in a year and a half though.
Next destination @ oldtraford😊
Раздавлен сегодняшней новостью. Нет слов ни на русском ни на английском языке чтобы передать как много значит Клопп для Ливерпуля. Тренера способного заменить его просто не существует(
Good Bye Klopp ❤❤❤❤
The year just started so beautifully, Jurgen, then this. Let us hope we can add the long-awaited 20th crown to our throne. Life as a Liverpool fan will never ever be the same anymore 😢. It's like a dagger to the heart. Nothing makes any sense. I can only wonder how each and every Liverpool fan is right now 💔 💔💔. This is our promise to you. We shall send you with the crown of England on your head. You made us from doubters to believers. This is our belief that we shall accomplish the long-awaited quadruple this season, and we will achieve no matter what the circumstances or how many corrupted referees will be thrown upon us. We will do it. ❤❤❤. Thank you, Jurgen. Once a Red, always a Red. YNWA
YNWA😭
Thank you for everything Jürgen. Now let's get XABI ALONSO TO COMMIT TO LIVERPOOL NOW!!!!!!
Thank you for everything. Going to miss you. Best of luck in the future.
I’m sad he’s leaving, he’s Liverpool through & through, totally understand the reason & wish him all the very best, absolutely he took us to where we are now, let’s win everything for him and the club this bloody season, come on you REDS, YNWA
😢 No words, absolutely non
Thanks man!! YNWA
💔.
Please don’t go 😢😩😭
It is going to be really difficult for liverpool to attract top talents based on our financial restrictions
It just show that the other great managers who wouldn't want to stop are fully psychopath. Jurgen clearly tell that he still wanted to be a normal human being that's why he needs to stop. The others on the other hand are willing to sacrifice their humanity and everything else
All the best, Jurgen! Been a great manager in the league. Coming from a spurs fan
So it's something health related
Will forever be a Liverpool legend, on a lighter note who else has their money on Xabi coming home?
Thanks for the memories, Jurgen. YNWA ❤
Love you Forever ❤
I always thought that one day there would come a point where he walked away. Hopefully the rest of his time at this club will continue in that same spirit and keep moving forward. .
"Jurgen Klopp you Will never walk alone". It's a bad news for us (Supporters) but we've to accept it. It's the end of amazing Era. You're my favorite mananger, I love you so much.  It's hard for all of us understand it but we need. You deserve our love, let's enjoy the short time that left. From now on, each game Will be special 'cause is a good-bye.❤👏👏
no more  7-0 .   dont leave pls
As a Manchester United supporter, I can say - with full confidence - that this man has been an absolute revelation, not just for English and European football, but for society as a whole. He is a man of tremendous principle and dignity, values that he displayed brilliantly during his time as Liverpool manager. The world could well with more people like him.  Best wishes, Jürgen.
This man is a giant of a human.. not just a manager! He will go down as one of the greats. Always a red ❤
This man’s Ultraboost game. 🥲
What happened 😢😢.. it's not look good for The club..  I think this is wrong way for Liverpool , OMG Liverpool get everything with You Klooop❤ Can the club can do it ?? not easy for it ...   Soon Klopp ✊🇮🇩
In chinese , 天下没有不散的筵席, no matter where u heading for your next stop, we are sure u will definitely be very successful also. Thank u sir for rebuilding our fortress, our team, our mentality our Club. YWNA. Hope where u go... this is still your Home at anfield!!
😢😢
Thank You for everything Gaffer ... this is unbelievable. I knew this day is coming one day but never thought it will be now. Thank you for Jurgen for giving me some of the best memories as Liverpool supporter. YNWA 🙏 😭😭😭😪 heartbroken TBH
d
Big man,just stay for two more seasons.....😢😢😢😢
Boooring!
😢😢😢
Go Barcelona?
Massive respect to Klopp. Wenger take a lesson.
Lifelong Arsenal fan, nothing but respect for this man and what's he's done for your club, I take my hat off to you Sir
As a city I'm really gutted,this man is a legend I think u probably see pep leaving soon, no klopp no one to challenge us I don't want that why now 😭
YNWA. Wish you have a good and well deserve break....🤟
Thank you for choosing Liverpool and made us dream. I feel sorrow😢
Immediately I saw the title , my heart sank... My God.
I knew the day will come when you leave. Nothing is forever.  Wish you all the best in your future endeavours!!!!
Love you klopp❤
Even as a United fan you have to give credit to Klopp, he’s a great manager and has been super important to Liverpool and the success they’ve had over the years.. definitely a big loss for Liverpool though..
If Klopp thinks it is the right time, then it's the right time.
As a chelsea fan l hv always admired Klopp since his days at Dortmund. This is a man who realises his limitations and admits that he is not a machine. This is a fundamental lesson to everyone. Value your wellbeing, know when to disengage and take a rest. Its good for your wellbeing.
If not for Man City & Real Madrid, Kloop would have bagged 4-5 Premier League and 3 Champions League titles  by now. This season is still going and he has the chance to grap more major titles.  After his battery is charged up, I see Barca and Bayern Munich as potential suitors for him. Maybe in Italy too.
nice
😢😢😢 I feel bad!
Brilliant to read lovely comments from Utd, Arsenal, Chelsea and City fans. There's enough childish hate in the game amongst fans. How refreshing to read support from rival club fans 🙏
Thank you Jurgen, many great memories and nights and hopefully many more to come this season.
"i'm not happy but I just know it's right"  Bro my heart😢
This video makes me cry.😢
Thanks you for everything you do . Remember u will never walk alone.😊😊😊
As a chelsea fan i like klopp...they're gona be big boots to fill 😊
Don't go.
How comes the microphone is near the one who asks the questions and not near Klopp, he is silent AF in this interview.
❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😅
If i am dreaming ,this will be my worst dream ever
Chelsea can , gotta say class interview around ,
❤🔥🙌⚽️
😢
One of the best football coaches in the world of all time! Thank you very much Jürgen.  We will always love you! YNWA ❤
What a very sad news 😭 Thank you klopp for everything you did to the club,, we will never forget you, your spirit will continue with the club for years, I’m pretty sure that not the only bad news we will hear this season.. I’m afraid that Mo and other players will also leave us, and that will be so fu hurts 💔
build him that damn statue that he deserves ! much love from germany to lfc & all you wonderful people
Thanks for the memories you helped us make this far. Let's make a few more before you leave us! We will always love you! YNWA
You need to have character to act like this . Thats why he so good at his job. Respect ./,,/
As a city fan I feel very sad. The only reason city became such a good team is because of those epic battles against Klopp. I feel like the premier league is never going to be as good now that Klopp is gone.
Will always have a special place for Jurgen in my heart and in every Liverpool fan. He picked the club from the dust after we lost hope he made us believers will always be a legend in every Liverpool FC fan eyes ❤❤
Jurgen will be in charge of the German national side in 12 months time .Good luck to him.Legend. P.s wishful thinking. Sack Southgate Klopp for England.
Still have 30 games to persuade him to stay let’s win them all and make him realise he isn’t finished just yet! Y.N.W.A
Thank you Mr Klopp
We love you too! Gutted by this news but 100% fully support your decision. YNWA!
We would definitely miss your passion for the club 💓 thanks  so much for the memories. You are a true Kop. YNWA
Beautiful interview; culturally iconic moment.
He made many of our dreams come true. He is special...Jurgen uber alles
Tu nie chodzi tylko o prowadzenie klubu piłkarskiego.Jurgen reprezentuje wszystko to w czym zakochują się dzieciaki na boisku od najmłodszych lat.Pasja,determinacja,poświęcenie, piękna gra..to jest piękna przygoda z Tobą u sterów! Szkoda ze zbliża się koniec ❤️‍🩹 na ostatnim meczu będę ryczał jak dziecko..YNWA
Klopp vs Pep =  Germany vs England and the Show must go on
It won't feel the same without him 😭😭😭
We are getting the quadruple this season! The players will give 110% this season and that will be enough for the quadruple. Thank you Jurgen! YNWA
He's going to Madrid with mbappe
If fans don't understand  they should support United instead.
This dude will go down as a Liverpool legend. He already cemented his legacy when they were on for the quadruple a few seasons ago. If Alonso is coming in to take over, it should be mandatory for him to come and learn as much possible from Klopp about how he’s got this team playing the way it does. Dude needs a statue, what an inspiration he is! he’s completely transformed the club, not just the team! Once in a lifetime manager! Just glad he came to Liverpool!! No way they would have won the trophies they did with another manager!!
Devastated to see this but at the same time very glad to have witnessed what he has done for Liverpool. Build the man his statue already!
Honesty through and through 🥂
i feel so empty and sad rn a hard decision to accept but if it's the right one for Klopp, I understand! let's squeeze everything out of this season <3 YNWA
Not a Liverpool fan ...but this chap is an absolute diamond...his enthusiasm and passion for the game and especially LFC is unquestionable....
😭😭
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No pleaseeeeee 😢😢😢😢😢
A class act all the way ♥
YNWA❤️❤️❤️ love u klopp
Good bye legend  Respect for you man❤
He owes us nothing. Absolutely heartbroken. Thank you for everything Jurgen ❤
😭😭😭😭😭
Top man Jurgen. Love you. All the best for the future.
Legend ❤
This is the worst news I have heard in years 😢
Thank you Jurgen Kloop, for bringing Liverpool to be the best... your service will be irreplaceable for Liverpool fans all over the world. YNWA💪🔥🔥
❤ 😭
❤❤❤💪
That’s quite a surprise. I always loved this guy, his character, his smile and his management style. Respect 🫡
감독님 처음시작부터 지금까지 너무 즐겁고 행복했습니다 이번시즌 성공적으로 마무리해요 우리  앞으로의 여정에서도 응원할 것이고 사랑합니다 위르겐 감사합니다 위르겐
You'll never walk alone
England Internationals after the Euros?
I am broken hearted. Our best manager in years. I bet he gets the Germany job.
Tears and Tears 😢
This is so hard to accept but we have to respect his decision. I wish he could go on and on. We wish you all the best life have to offer sir. Wherever you go I know you will always have club Liverpool in your heart ♥️. I thank you for all what you have done and will be doing for the club. ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Never work for US owners 😂😂
Always❤ you're so tired big respect just relax klop big. Coach
No matter where he goes, what he does and what happens, our love for Klopp will never fade. He brought life into our club when we needed it the most but we all just can’t predict the future cuz that is how life works.We admire him a lot cuz over the years he had been more than a family but we have to show him the level of love , respect and support we have for him .We wish him all the best.🥹🥹🥹🥹
He came to Liverpool as the 'normal one's he will leave as the 'loved one'. Massive respect to you sir, JK. You'll Never Walk Alone!!
Klopp boss we going to miss u were ever u going we bless u what a  excellent boss never walk alone viva klopp viva klopp
3min in and I had to pause. It feels like I have a big lump in my throat and my heart is being crushed.   Last time I felt this way was when my fist serios girlfriend and the only woman to whom I ever have confessed my love to cheated and dumped me.  BUT we all new earlier or later this time will come.
While this is a painful bit of news to take.  I take this time to say thank you Mr. Klopp, taking us from doubters to believers, as promised.   You will always hold a place in every Liverpool supporters heart.  No words will be enough to sing your praise, but maybe just the line “I am so glad Juergen is a red…”  Best wishes on your life’s journey, walk on.  I would have loved to meet you.  ❤
What a man. Jurgen, you have done us proud. I completely understand why you need to go, last season must have been the hardest but look where we are now. Best wishes for the future YNWA
He was and will continue to be known as Mr Liverpool 17:13 😢❤😭
We have to finish this amazing era with PL title!  Thank you Jürgen, for everything.   WE'RE LIVERPOOL WE'RE FAMILY
Guter Zeitpunkt. Vernünftige Entscheidung . Super traurig.
How can you not love this man!? Thank you, you have made football better!
I accept but definitely gutted
We love you Jurgen ❤
😂😂love you forever
😢
Steve Cooper INCOMING☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️☄️
Der Gaffer. Thank you. For everything. YNWA 😢🥹🥺👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾🙋🏾‍♂️💯
Running out of energy ....that's the true point 1:10....17:00...23:10
My day was ruined
Thanks Jurgen
Liverpool without Klopp, wow, what a thought. A man larger than life who has given us 8 of the best years in football a fan could ask for. Watching this, with tears in my eyes, im not sad or bitter that he has decided to part ways with Liverpool as a manager, im rejoicing in the fact he created the memories and team that will be looked upon as the standard. He was the standard. He is the standard for a manager at any club. Klopp is imitated but never duplicated.   Klopp, from myself, a fan who has  watched from Australia, never seeing you manage in person, will never forget your impact on the lives on the Reds. YNWA Klopp - Im so glad that Jurgen was out man!  - Lachie
thank you Jurgen Klopp for all this yers thank you for all you have bring for the club and fands you did good for us thanks for the amazing job you did :D
wth?? noo me norbert😢
Jürgen will be next German Bundeskanzler…Boom!
BIG LOVE BIG MAN
ฉันจะรักคุณไปตลอด❤
Not a Liverpool fan but I hope they win the league for Klopp this season.
i can't believe that klopp is leaving
The reason is so Jurgen and so perfect and I can so understand it
I saw this coming I'm not going to lie. The man has given absolutely everything to the club, led by example and fully understood the assignment of what it means to be the Liverpool fc manager. Unfortunately such a demanding role can take it's toll on even the most strong willed of people. Admittedly it's sad to see him go but if he's feeling the drain it's a good idea for him to get out while he's still got something left in the tank and regain some of the vigour and enthusiasm that we've been so used to seeing from the gaffer. I wish him all the best in his life and he will forever be a Liverpool FC legend, he's up there with the very best.
Properly shocked. He is Liverpool and like many amazing managers of the past he will go down in history as one of the very best. I respect his decision to retire (most likely). It can’t be easy to do year in and year out. I’m just really afraid for the team next year. The only manager I would want is Pep. Maybe Gabi Alonso from Beyer Leverkusen ????
What is Liverpool going to start from without this man. I just came back from school, open my phone and dis video pops up. Im not happy with this news. Liverpool became relevant because of you. I love you sir.
I will miss the pictures of you hugging your players. I really don't know what to say other than thank you Jurgen.   Y W N A
Can't believe it. Gonna miss him dearly YNWA ❤❤❤
Thank you Jurgen Klopp for everything you have done for our club our players our fans and our owners....let's send you out the way you deserve we are winning the fucking lot!! And you leave immortal right up there with Shankley and Paisley and I already know you are leaving us in a good place and time you don't need to explain Jurgen any real supporter will just understand and you will forever be a red!!! And you will never ever ever walk alone!! We love you Jurgen Klopp ❤ from Perth Australia 🇦🇺
He will always be in our hearts and go down as a Liverpool legend❤😢
Full respect to Jurgen done 100% since day 1, heartbroken to see him going but this football in the end, hopefully we get a new good manager no one likes kloopo for sure but we can hope.
Thank you for everything. Your energy reached us all, gave us wonderful adventures and I wish you a happy healthy sabbatical <3. You're an awesome person.
The best manager of all time...😭😭😭
Truly a Legend he's right 💪🏿💪🏿 forever our BOSS
I'm glad Jurgen has decided to leave at the end of the season, instead of just packing right now. This gives the players time to let him go, and the chance for fans to give him a prober goodbye
Such a great, beautiful, respectful speech, I respect your decision and wish you have a great normal life as much as you want. Let’s end this season with more passion and get 4 trophies for them. 🏆
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Do it Make it Play it the best of the best for the BOSS!
Jörgen klopp great manager👍 You are always welcome to coach Fcbarcelona 💙❤ Offcors after Liverpool job, with all respect 🙏🏼
Chelsea fan, but I've got nothing but respect for this man. The league will be worse off without him.
The wife said enough is enough.
Klopp.... More like Flopp 😂😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂
You are always in my heart, my legend. jurgen klopp .. ywna
as someone who n the past has 'hated' ferguson, 'hated' mourinho, i really think the premier league will miss jurgen klopp. always been respectful, handled himself with class and has earned his place along side shankley and paisley etc.
One last dance ❤️
We love klopp so much, thanks for everything
He‘s an absolute legend🫡
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.
Manchester United fans must be happy right now lol
Im aware that Klopp is believer in Jesus Christ. I just wonder if he is being spiritually promoted to get out of the game and focus on what the Lord wants him to do?????  Whatever he ends up doing, he'll be a blessing 🙏  Thanks for the memories Klopp. And God bless you and your family. God and family are more important than football!
What a man, what a personality Jurgen.  Thank you for everything and so much respect from 🇯🇵
Even as a Tottenham fan I really like this guy . I think he is one of the greatest managers of all time. Peace Jurgen 😢😢
😂😂😂😂😂😂
wounded, all the best boss, thanks for the memories, youll be greatly missed. YNWA 🔴
Tough one to take, but his health is his number one priority end of the day. Good luck for the future Klopp
I'm not even a Liverpool fan and I'm gutted. Jurgen has been immense  for Liverpool but also for the league. He made Liverpool what they are now and Liverpool will struggle to find someone so aligned with the club, its history and the supporters. Good luck Klopp, you deserve the best send off a manager could get. You have made so many memories and have conducted yourself impeccably during your tenure. If he ever fancied another crack I'd happily see him at west ham (dreams).
Thank you for everything Jurgen. You have done so much for the club YNWA ❤
Top top manager , even better human. But Liverpool oh boy, Salah will follow obviously , Virgil end of his prime, if anyone goes for Allison. I don’t see them anywhere near the competing for top level anymore. Wow wow
The next united manager for sure🎉
I feel heartbroken  and fighting back to my tears,it’s so shocking announce bc I imagine you in Liverpool for entire your career,thank you for all the great moments that you made for world ❤️love and respect you so much ,hope it change att the end of season bc every game we saw improvement of gameplay otherwise i will be so happy for you to take good rest and live life and again back home❤️as you asked we will support team we are Liverpool ❤️you will never walk alone ❤️
Unpopular opinion:just for a fairytale story Jugern has to win the Premier league for the rest of the league and for us Liverpool fans.❤YNWA EL KLOPPO❤
OH MY! We can't let this guy, GO
Hi teme iverpool, i am  want to play for Liverpool so can you please help me ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Maturnuwun pakde kloop jasa mu neng liverpool badhe terus dikenang karo kopites-kopites indo, ynwa selalu pakde kloop mugi badhe tansah diparingi sukses ten pundi mawon, salam soko indo jowo 🇮🇩. 🫵🏼👍🏼🙏🏼
I love you Jurgen!
You gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them... Klopp you are a legend!
❤❤❤❤❤
Bring in Xabi
Where to next jurgen???😕😭
I can't even bring myself to imagine anyone else doing those press conferences... But what a legend. Deserves his time off 100%
Beyond proud of him. Everything about this is exactly why he's been so brilliant for us, unquantifiably so, in thousands of cultural, material ways. Devastated but support him fully.
Jurgen will never walk alone. ❤
I'm shocked. But the other emotion is gratitude for the fact we had this man for 9 years.  He was literally the perfect fit.
Is this a joke??? Please tell me it is.
Wow I’m lost for words💔💔💔
What ????? 😢
The best manager ever.
We are finished 😢
Absolute legend I always like him as a person , being arsenal fan even can't make me hate , wish you all the best Boss
My weekend been ruined with this news but I understand Klop and nothing more important than health.  Thank you so for all this time. You already a living legend and will always be grateful what you did. YNWA ❤️
Don't cry because it ended be happy cause this man made history for Liverpool and his journey didn't end prematurely like Tuchel's job at Chelsea Liverpool were blessed to have this man for such a long time 🫡
There must be a problem, why Jurgen suddenly made such a sudden statement...I'm sad, Kops😢😢😢
Man I really have no idea how to handle this. 10 years ago I needed something more in my life, I was flat, I had no aspirations, I was confused about what I would be in the future. I started watching more football, and found myself attached to Jurgen and his squad at Dortmund. I loved every second of each match I saw. I loved the atmosphere, I loved the spectacle, it let me feel emotions I didn't realize I had been repressing.   When Klopp announced he was leaving Dortmund, I was at a crossroads. I was finishing High School, and I didn't see a future for myself in further education. I saw my path very rapidly diverging from my peers. I had begun to find solace in watching Klopp lead his team, whether it was a good day or a bad day for me or the squad, it always served as an outlet that I couldn't find in normal life. Now that very personal ritual was being upended - just as my life was rapidly evolving.  Ten years before, I was in Paris with family on vacation on the night of the CL final in Istanbul. I fell asleep before the match kicked off. I wasn't even ten years old, an American kid who played Soccer but didn't have any love for professional clubs. When I woke up the next morning, I don't think I had ever seen my Dad so animated. He regaled our family with the story of the match - Milan had scored three, Liverpool had their backs against the wall. The comeback, the double save in extra time, Dudek's ('The Dude,' he affectionately called him) wobbly legs and becoming the hero in the shootout. My dad wasn't an LFC fan, he really wasn't a fan of any sports team. He loves tales of fighting back against impossible odds, he loves stories that help us understand our own humanity. It was the first time I saw sport as more than a game - in certain moments sport became an allegory for meaning itself.  When Jurgen announced he was coming to LFC that memory rushed back into my brain. I was certain then that I would support Jurgen, and LFC, and the journey they took together until they could go no further. Today, I learned the limits of where that journey could go. I struggle to think of where I go from here. For now I reflect on the memories, and of all the wonderful moments, and of all the tragedies, and of the songs, and of the goals.
Thank you for everything Jurgen. Boss lad 💪
After listening to the announcement. It’s clear he is burned out. That simple. Burn out. It happens a lot here in the states.
I think it would hurt less if my wife said she would divorce me. Thank you for all the memories, the moments, good or bad. You gave it all you could for this club and for the fans all around the world. We love you, Jürgen Norbert Klopp. Your 9 years here will never be forgotten! Y.N.W.A ❤
He will always have place in are heart. This man has done hell of a lot for the club and fans. Be a legend manager in are eye and heart and will be respected for every ❤❤ YNWA
it will all go downhill from here.
In Klopp We Trust
Thank you Jurgen, for giving all for this club and team❤ You will be missed YNWA!
Klopp ... Respect your leadership and how you give flavour to the game and enhance the strategy -- It is entertaining! Always await for your come back  From non-Liverpool fans who respect you and the club!
No words. Love this man. Love this club. He’s done everything. He’s brought so much hope and joy to my heart, the memories… iconic. The king❤ All things must end. Let’s make this season one to remember.
🌪️😭🌪️😭🌪️😭🌪️😭🌪️😭🌪️😭
Thank you Jurgen Klopp, back in 2015 my friend and I were huge fans of you in Dortmund and Reus, but once I heard you went to Liverpool, i went insane and times flies🫡❤️
We need to Win everything this season  ♥
Wish u all the best jk😎😎 Thank u for the priceless moments sir
Klopp,plz extend your contact or I am about to die😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 🥲🥲🥲🥲
I think mental exhaustion and fatigue are natural and it is a decision that we must respect and wish him the best success as the professional he is.
Wow Boss , you spoke from the heart .Listen to this interview I genuinely understand and  I respect your decision. Thank you for all the memories Mr Jurgen Klopp .YNWA
Jurgen u our a once in a generation manager thank-you for everything we will miss uxx
Einer der sympathischsten Persönlichkeiten im heutigen Fußball! Erhol dich gut und wer weiß, vielleicht bekommt das DFB-Team auch irgendwann mal die Ehre...
I haven't felt pain like this since Stevie! Klopp thank you for everything, I got to witness pure football greatness and celebrate the first league title in my life time with my own children, you will always be the boss! YNWA
He did a miracle job at this club on a limited budget
I don't have words to say, so heartbroken. Nothing but RESPECT for this LEGEND! Let's f...ng make the end of this season special!!!
Come Home to Dortmund Kloppo! We need you!😀
Top Man and Top Manager!! Goodluck Jurgen in future Endeavors!!
My man, you were and you are a inspiration of a person. You changed a lot of lives, not only in liverpool. I can't thank you enough for all of these years you offered to us. I hope all the best for you and your family. YNWA Jurgen, believe me you'll never be forgoten. (still crying)  "It’s not important what people think when you come in, it’s much more important what people think when you leave."

Юрий Палыч....

TENGO EL PRESENTIMIENTO DE QUE EN EL FUTURO VA A SER DIRECTOR TECNICO DEL REAL MADRID.😢😢ESTO CUANDO DESCANSE DE SU AÑO SABATICO.😢😢
Klopp absolute legend. I wish you all the best.
Don’t cry because it’s over smile because it happened 💔👏
A fantastic manager and a very sad day. All the best for the future. Thanks for the memories😊
What nooooooooooooooooooo
Will win the world cup with Germany in a few years after a long break.
❤
You will forever be missed Sir ❤. Don't know how will the team cope without you. YNWA
I'm still not believing this 💔💔💔
So upset to see but I understand nothing lasts forever, better to go out at the top!
I'm a United fan and tbh. This is very sad. Liverpool rivalry with Klopp just seems right.
Heartbreak, Klopp is Liverpool all the way, it is a sad day for us lads
Don't be surprised when he becomes the head coach of a certain national team after the Euros.
sad to be true
Man .. Shell shocked BUT. Let’s enjoy the now every game has always been a final, if nothing else this continues until the final match
What a class act. I’m not even a supporter but I was getting choked up. ❤
Get a manger in now to work with klopp before he goes
Afrikaans: Hy Klopp
I’m a Man Utd fan and I’ve got to say what a fucking job that man has done with Liverpool FairPlay, credit when credit is due he single handedly turned Liverpool into a way oiled machine again and no matter how much it pains me to say Liverpool have been brilliant to watch under klopp wish him all the best.
YNWA!
ermmm..maybe salah also will leave the club at the end of the season…
Top coach and even better person. Being able to let go and leave on his own terms is typical Jürgen Klopp.  Much respect and love him from Hamburg, Germany
GOOD RIDDANCE.
Thank You Coach...YNWA
KLOOPP BRAZILIAN TEAM
All us liverpool fans amd even others love u klopp and will always cherish u as our manager but just know one thing.... YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE. 😢
Premiership Football is Stagnant and rotten ! I can see all the managers pixxing off !
Thank you Klopp, the man who turned us from a doubter into a believer. YNWA
Juergen you made us enjoy being Liverpool fans again after a rough period and you made us believe like you said. You’ll be forever a red. Now finish your legacy and win us won more title! YNWA.
Liverpool has been good for Jurgen. When Jurgen came first he was losing his hair, had yellow teeth and wore thick glasses. Now he has a full head of hair, lovely white teeth and no glasses. Why leave now Jurgen?
Liverpool gone miss you Jürgen ❤ Danke ❤
Bloody hell, what a sad sad day.. But if it´s Jurgens wish, then that´s it. I have accepted every decision he has made in LFC. Danke fur alles, Jurgen. You´re outstanding, nothing less. You´ll never walk alone, mein freund 🙏
😢thank you klopp
thank you Klop! for everything, making us dream, making us believe, going to the best clubs in the world and giving them hell! WE LOVE YOU!
😭😭
Build this man a statue right now
수고하셨습니다 위르겐!!
probably the worst thing that could've happened just did, Klopp going, whole coaching staff going, Schmadtke going. Will Mo also go now? A lot of things need to be sorted now ahead of the summer transfer window which is crucial for us and squad depth, especially if Mo leaves. BUT we have a title to win! We need to send Klopp off with a bang. Please guys do it for him!
I am much more willing to lose Moh Salah, Alisson, Van Dijk. than Jürgen Klopp 😢
”You’ll never walk alone Klopp” You will always be remembered❤
i just can't go with liverpool anymore....we r fucked......
It's not so important, what people think when you come in, it's much more important, what people think when you leave.
Thank you Boss ... I and my kids owe you all the joy as being Liverpool Fans ... YNWA
@LiverpoolFC Let klopp have his break after 1 year and try to bring him back if he wants to at that time. Please lfc do this. He just needs a break.
😢
Jürgen Klopp👑
God Bless you Jurgen! You’ve made us Liverpool supporters extremely proud of what you’ve done for this club. You’ll forever be a Liverpool Legend. YNWA ❤
Thank you everything you the best one man i see 😢
Thank You For Everything 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻The Legend 🫶🏻The Hero 🏆
This day might be the darkest day for Liverpool he made change from doubters to believers. no one can replace him  We are Liverpool
Nah,AM Fucking Crying and I am like NO and NO
LEGEND YNWA we love you infinitely Herr Jürgen
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.   No amount of words would ever describe what you did for us .  YNWA
so sad can't say anything and I need to say good luck boss thank you for everything. Thank for 9 years for liverpool  you'll never walk alone.
Noooooooo! We love you Jurgen, good luck whatever you do but absolutely gutted, beautiful man and what a manager, huge loss for liverpool, hope you are ok, you'll never walk alone😢😢😢
HEARTBROKEN but do understand energy is very important im these jobs. We RESPECT you always & forever. FAMILY is also important and grandkids even more missing out on their growth is a sin. Go do this for yourself. RESPECT LFC FAN❤❤❤
I'm a Manchester City fan (yeah yeah, I know, I'm their only fan) and while Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp have been a real thorn in our side for many years, I also respect him immensely for what he's achieved at that club and how he's managed to keep the Premier League very competitive and exciting despite our dominance. He's caused upsets for us but at the end of the day you have to admit he's a world class manager and really turned Liverpool around from being an alright top 10 side to one of the best teams in Europe. The rivalry between him and Pep Guardiola has been really fun to watch too and without Guardiola I think Liverpool would've been winning every season and vice versa. I'll actually miss seeing Klopp in the Premier League in a way. maybe someday we'll see him manage somewhere again, even if he goes to a "lesser league". Good luck to him wherever he goes.
100% fans love & ready to support you, Boss. Pls stay with us❤
The same thing happened at dourtmound, he’s tired he needs a break and wants to leave on a high. What’s a legend jurgen im so glad ur a red ❤
top man
April fools?
I cant imagine Liverpool without with Klopp 💔
Please don't go.
Owners are to be blamed for sure !
I love this guy.
He arrived the self-proclaimed "normal one", he leaves as "the great one"!!  I too am gutted to hear his announcement, but there is work to do and we will support him and the team all the way.  Fair play to you Jurgen. We are truly grateful for all you are doing and have done for us! Thank you so much!!
Thank you for everything Mr.Klopp , I wish you the best on the next chapter of your journey
Because he loves his country more and they are waiting for him to take them home.
Thank you for everything boss.
Honestly as a United fan am gutted we lose such an incredible coach and person from out league. He really did take the culture of Liverpool to heart and what a period Liverpool had under him! Only city stopped it being even more impressive. On the other hand hope these loud mouth scousers get gerrard 😂 would love to see him better his "slippy g" Moment by completely destroying Liverpool lol
what a legend in liverpool, even tho i would miss him but he needs a rest
Thank you for everything !!  Right from giving us hope of a title in 4 years after coming in to developing exciting teams , winning everything possible , great passion, players coming good at crunch matches to unbelievable comebacks. Your  confidence and transparent communication  set the standards . We could not have asked for more . Wishing you all the very best for future years .
Noo!!! Happy days are over for us then😔😔
No its a joke 😮
I'm not crying 😭😭😭 . . . You're crying 😭
Welcome Xavi Alonso!!! The only choice who could make me smile in this moment
I am not a Liverpool fan, but I am almost crying now. Such a heartfelt explanation on Jürgen's part.
Really sad...he should stay...
The legend❤
Thank you Legend ❤❤❤
I hope we build him a statue next to Shankly
Thank you Klopp, for every every every every everything that you do for Liverpool for LFC Supporter. We love you very much! Respect your decision!
The NORMAL ONE is the really SPECIAL ONE. Honest, brave and loyal.
This guy was literally behind most of the happiest moments I've experienced so far in my life. All the best for you and your family Klopp❤
As a Chelsea fan all I can say is, what a legend. His imprint on that liverpool team has been massive.
Thank you for everything Juergen! Let's finsih this season in style!
boykizitolfc4life: WRONG TIME TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE LEAVING LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB (My beloved Football Club). Well, thank you very much for all that you've have done for my beloved club (Lfc).

Legend!!!

Shocking. Def Liverpool for life.

Heartbroken, still love you jurgen klopp, ynwa
I love liv because klopp
This just gives me more Respect for: *Carlo Ancelotti* 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
My tears started bursting out when Klopp said he would never manage another club in England 😢 forget about this season, how're we gonna recover from this
I’m balling 😭😭😭
im crying... why...? why...? and why jurgen
I am devastated 😢  Being in Madrid for the Champions League triumph, singing at the fan park & trying to sleep outside of a train station with groups of other Liverpool supporters will live with me forever.  I hope Jurgen does a Jordan Belfort (Wolf of Wall Street) & screams, “I’m not ****ing leaving!”  I hope.  🥺
thank you  jurgen kloop goodbye❤
Nothing but love and respect for my man. Do what you got to do. You gave us your best, now it's time to rest.
I am gona miss him so bad 😢
Very sad news. I Hope klopp will only trained this Clubs and come Back oder take a job for a national team
Love you Jurgen thank you for everything
Thanks for the great years,memories, trophies, laughter and most of all thanks for your loyalty. You'll be truly miss. Let's end this season with one to remember. Klopp YNWA
I cant watch this😭😭
I have that horrible sick feeling in my gut, never thought id feel that when regards to football.... Jurgen has been amazing, the staff and players too. its a sad day as a Liverpool fan of over 40 years.  Would love for some miraculous U turn but i respect Juregens ultimate decision.
Nooooooooooooooooooooo 😢❤😢❤
You have been the most wonderful manager and role model. My great grandad was Alex Raisbeck who played for LFC early last  century and I’ve supported Liverpool all my life. I’m a few years older than Jurgen and can say best manager of my life.  Have you thought about politics. The world needs decent, honest and humble leaders and there’s no one better ❤YNWA
😭😭😭
Very sad 😢 I wish him the best for the future. I Will ever support Liverpool F.C. ❤ YNWA
The Last Dance Lets get the premier league championship once more with you coach
We will All miss him
💔❤
I am literally crying right now😢💔....i really cant believe this is happenning💔
You won't leave us🥺   from thailand❤
YNWA
I’ve got to say this man is a living legend if our fans do not respect his decision they are fake, Klopp is truly an all time great and deserves all the best! Thanks for everything Jurgen Klopp we here at Liverpool will always love you.❤
Noooooooooooooooo please dont leave youre the best manager ever for Liverpool please try to win us 1 more champions league and develop talents like Nunez and Gakpo
Leicester City Fan I'm shocked that he is leaving by the end of the season as I have so much respect for him but he goes down amongst the greatest managers in the premier league and in Liverpool history alongside Bill Shankly and I remember watching his first performance on sky sports back in 2015 and he said give us time and in five years we win the league and he did that in 2020 during Covid and as well slowly rebuilding a team from 8th in the year Leicester won the league to where you are now where are you challenging titles every season I am rooting you guys for the rest of the season so he can win trophies and as well he deserves a statue for everything he has done for Liverpool 1 Premier League 1 Champions League 1 FA Cup 1 League Cup 1 Community  Shield 1 UEFA Super Cup 1 Fifa Club World Cup and i wish him all the best whatever he does after the season finishes
Absolutely gutted he’s going , been the best manager in the world and he’s at our club , nothing but respect for jurgen a man I don’t know 😂 YNWA jurgen ❤️
I’m devastated
❤
No please nooooo😢
End of an era, not just for Liverpool but football itself. Klopp's relentlessly high energy 4-3-3 made English football fun again.
He looks tired and deserves some family time. His legend will last forever, he rebuilt the club and gave us fans immense pride. Almost irreplaceable 💔💔
I was absolutely upset when I heard this news. But after this interview, I have my answers. Nothing but love for you dear Jurgen. All the best!! YNWA ❤
this man changed the epl totally watched him spurs vs pool champions lg all the players crying coz they lost he hugged them all unseen before what a man
Klopp is just worry he would not achieve quadraple this season 😊
This love and lasting bond will forever be with this club and the people who love this club and this man.YNWA❤❤❤
This man himself is a single reason why I support and love this club that much. That was a pleasure to see the most passionate and dedicated team for the last 8 years, thank you Mr. Jurgen❤️
Gutted. An amazing manager and man. So thankful for his time with the club.
😢😢😢
This is heartbreaking news, I wish he change his mind
my goat😍❤😪
Come to madrid kloppo
This feels like death 😢
Class act by a class person and manager. Wishing him the normal life he craves.
No no no
YNWA❤❤😢
💔🥀
Klopp should have been a priest.
Was hoping it was a troll, still hoping its some kind of AI video
❤❤love klopp utd fan here 👏
Stevie G wiping away the tears in his eyes with 100 quid notes after hearing this news.
Dude. I’m a freaking American with no stake in any Prem team and this man has single-handedly made me a Liverpool fan. There isn’t a more exciting team to watch on the planet imo and thats due to his management prowess and brilliant gegenpress. You will be missed sir.
Mr.Jurguen Kropp You are the legend head coach for Liverpool . I would like thank you to made this club great team. You will never walk alone.
Never thought I would wake up today and see this, I knew the man was human but him leaving Liverpool was a day I wish would never come. Thank you Klopp for everything you have given to this club, to these players, and to me. This man needs to be immortalized in Liverpool in some way
I think Klopp is not happy because he was not getting the players he wanted. He cannot win again and again with the same team. And I do not think Liverpool is a huge spending club on players.
No words.. just devastated.. just want  to thank you for all the super memories.. thankyou so much kloppo .. ynwa 💪
WHAT A GEM! It's gonna be a tough pill to swallow for all of us LFC Fans. Can't deny that this feels like a personal loss!
❤❤❤❤
Legend!! Wish you all the best
they should build a statue
From doubters to believers.❤
💔
😭😭😭พูดอะไรไม่ออกจริงๆ มึน งง ไปหมด  ฟังบทส้มภาษณ์ของคล็อปป์ทุกคำ ก็ยังมีแต่คำถามซ้ำๆ  ก้องในหัวตลอดว่า เพราะอะไร ทำไม ๆ รู้ว่าต้องยอมรับการตัดสินอย่างที่คล็อปป์บอก แต่มันทำใจยากจริงๆ 😭 I hope its not true, just April fool, right?
😭😭😭😭😭 เขาคือโค้ชทีดีทีสุดหลังก่อตั้งพรีเมียร์ลีก
YNWA ❤
Whoes the next????
Premier league will not be the same, the man is pure class and this shows it. Future Germany manager, rest of the world watch out !
Noo😮😢
Incredible, what AI can do nowadays.
thankyou for all you have done for the club
😭😭😭😭😭 เขาคือโค้ชทีดีทีสุดหลังก่อตั้งพรีเมียร์ลีก
Thank you Boss  Thank you for everything. I love you  Boss  Jurgen klopp
Jetzt hol nochmal die CL und werde dann Weltmeister 2026. but…no pressure😂. Lot‘s of love Jürgen
We all love you klopp❤
Much love from the Liverpool supporters Jurgen best of luck with your next venture boss man YNWA 🫶🏼❤️
Danke Jurgen ❤
I think xabi Alonso would be a great replacement I'm not even a Liverpool fan but he's a special manager and done well bringing Liverpool back to the top the way he has will be sad but hopefully a good future for Liverpool 👍
❤💔
😭
Let's hope we get alonso
Bye Jürgen 😭
Love you Jurgen ❤
Incredible man he will be missed
Gutted
Always a red ❤ Thanks klopp ❤
Is there a love button we can press instead of a thumbs up, YouTube? This man deserves all the love from us
No klopp dont leave us pls😢
As a supporter in the US I'm going to keep it simple and it says it all.  "Thank You and YNWA"
Thank you Jurgen!! It was very happy time with you. We’ll miss you 😢
From doubters to believers❤️‍🔥
Thanks for everything BOSS 😢 YNWA
Absolutely devastated 😭 Let's end this season on high lads This man deserves the best farewell YNWA❤
Klopp deserves as much praise for his work with LFC as he does reinvigorating the ethos of the city in similar shades of Shankly. Incredibly heartbreaking news, but so excited for the rest of this season and to celebrate our manager
Best Coach Ever
Modern football will always be remembered for what you have achieved and NOT what you have built. Thank you Jurgen and god bless you Y.N.W A
Football Legend + Great Human Being. We were lucky to have him.
The best manager ive ever seen klopp we gna miss u thanks for all the years always liverpool fan
Its a sad day but we got to keep our head high and hope Klopp can bring that PL title. It would be the best send off.   Klopp is only human and I understand he's running out of energy and just wants a normal life.  Klopp is the best manager in the world. He transformed Liverpool just like Bill Shankly did.  All the best to him after he leaves but we're still in for the quadruple. LETS BRING IT HOME LADS FOR A PERFECT SEND OFF!
I’m absolutely devastated 😢we are going to miss him so so much
GOAT, brought us from mid table to some of the best moments of my life..  you do what you need to do. YNWA
i hate to watch this video.. 😢😢😢
Gutted 😢 2 weeks into retirement.. Klopp will be bored😅 All the best chief ❤
Even though I'm not a Liverpool supporter.  I am gutted for the club, Klopp has brought so much passion into the Premier League. One of the best managers. Will Be sad to see him go! Although I wish him all the best with wherever he goes and whatever he does!   YNWA ❤
Everyone's entitled to live a normal life, even the Normal One. Thank you for everything, Jürgen. YNWA
Jurgen saying its what he owes us. He owes us nothing but we owe him everything. 😢❤
ima newcastle fan and i love klopp he's been one of the best managers iv ever seen , so well done mr klopp and have a good life outside of football , ye not fancy managing england pls in the summer 😂
Liverpool in the championship in 2026
No way. Wounded.
Sounds like he needs a long vacation. Hopefully he comes back in a few years to continue making history with this club.
Arsenal fan. Thank you for everything Jürgen. Avoided a club catastrophe for Arsenal in 2019. Whoever wins at the Emirates on the 4th of Feb I hope he gets a standing ovation
This is one of those type of decisions that changes you deeply, like for example when you get used to seeing one player or a coach at one club for so long, those 2 things become one and the same. Like ronaldo went from Madrid, this is the same change for liverpool, i thought klopp would coach liverpool for several more seasons but this is so upsetting for me cuz i love liverpool and klopp together, its a perfect match made in heaven. Thank you Jurgen for winning so many trophies for liverpool but this just saddens me so much. Liverpool has to be very careful with choosing the next coach because we dont want ten haag situation. Thank you Jurgen, and lets win the premier league for you to go on s high note. 🤞For Xabi alonso to be our new coach!
😢😢😢😢😢
Respekt für die Entscheidung. War bestimmt schwer aber besser kann man nicht gehen als Trainer. Und es ist sehr wichtig auch an sich selber zu Denken.Alles richtig gemacht und auf der ganzen Welt Eindruck hinterlassen in deiner Zeit in der du den FC Liverpool wieder zu dem gemacht hast, was er einst war. Auch Deutschland einfach super Vertreten im Ausland.
Thanks and good luck Jurgen. Logical choice for next manager of Germany's national team! After a well-deserved rest!
😂😂😂thanks kloop plz don't stay
This man is one of the biggest personalities of football in the last decade… what more can I say? I’ve been near speechless on this topic for like hours
That is one hell of a good man and his decision should be respected and not questioned
Just think of the legacy he is leaving behind. Respect from a Barca fan
😿 Not you Commander..  I'm feeling sad.. 🥺
Don't be TOO sad that it's coming to an end, be happy that it happened. Ynwa, Jurgen.
In future more than the player... u wil b miss 😢❤
We respect completely your choice 🙏🙏🙏 u gave us everything we have dream about. U have make me smile watching LFC again. U have make me wanna stay up watching LFC in 3-4am local time in Singapore after a long day of work. I thank u for being LFC Manager and we are forever grateful and in your debt for all these experiences 🙏🙏🙏 Live well and find your peace in Life Mr Klopp.
Send him off with English football's first quadruple boys. It's the only farewell gift worthy of the goat.
am arsenal fan, i like klop, he's one of my favourite coaches, he's cool
Jürgen, gute Entscheidung. Man merkt, dass es schwer ist für dich, aber du es brauchst. Tolle Karriere, toller Trainer. Einfach ehrlich. Bleib so wie du bist und tu, was für dich und deine Familie gut ist. Ich bin kein Fan deiner bisherigen Teams, aber du hast mich immer zu einem Symphathisanten (oder wir man das schreibt) gemacht.
Jurgen klopp know time to stop...........he deserve to enjoy the life..........he...." THE NORMAL ONE "........like he said  first time he arrived at LFC CLUB
Sepertinya Real Madrid Tujuannya
Only love for Jürgen!
I don't know how he does it... but he's somehow even managed to make him leaving the club be beautiful. What a legacy. What a man. What a  legend. YNWA Jürgen.
Komm nach Duisburg
Saya sedih mendengar berita ini.Legenda Liverpool..semoga Mr Klopp bisa merubah keputusannya. Tetapi jika tdk kami akan menghormatimu selalu.YNWA
Jurgen, when I was at my lowest moment 5 years ago, you and the boys helped lift me up and keep moving forward.  I am sad to see you leaving the club, but I back you 100%.  Thank you for leading the club I love with such class. I hope you find what you are looking for and have a great life.
All love ❤❤❤
God damn
Jurgen: Thanks you very much!
Can't believe he is leaving us!
Sir Jürgen Klopp🫡 From a Man United fan
I will never forget the moments. The passion. We will miss you, and hope you the best in the future. Being a liverpool fan takes it's toll on you, I can only imagine what it's like at the helm. Jurgen Klopp. I will miss you, always.
He saved this club, and did everything for club that we'd been waiting for. I still remember that interview when Liverpool just signed klopp and he gave statement with full of confidence and look what we got, everything man, every fu*king thing. He's the most dangerous man in the Liverpool FC club.  I love you klopp.❤
❤
I leave this for you guys to copy/paste with the Umlaut: Jürgen
He wants a normal life . Let me tell you normal doesn't exist.
Bielsa in next
Nooooo❤❤
YNWA Klopp an absolute legend thank you sir 🙏🏻
And still Pep remains....playing with monopoly money 😢. A travesty. They should have announced they are moving on together. This is not right
Surely he should have waited til the end of the season to announce the news - LFC might not recover from this just as things were going smoothly on the football pitch and looking to get the quadruple or at least give it a go- The pressure on achieving anything is now that much harder - Thanks Klopp
LETS GET 4 MORE TROPHIES BEFORE YOU LEAVE
Zakken gevuld wegwezen is normaal et kan ze geen moer schelen heel simpel zoals de spelers ook zakken vullen wegwezen klaar
Klopp will have a rest and then go on and coach Germany in the next world cup. England fans will still cheer.
It’s ok  klopp we will all miss you 😭😭🥺🥺
Bloke needs a statue.
We miss him more clop is agood guy good luck and thanks him ....
This doesn't make any sense. Why is he going. Where is better than your home?. Personally I do not care if he wins anymore trophies or not. Well, just have to respect this Man and wish him well. I hope Pep is given a chance or Alonso should be dragged down to Anfield
We better win the league now in front of a  packed Anfield to bid him farewell .🔴✊🏼🔴
PGMOL have got their wish.
😢❤❤
Thank you Jurgen klopp❤
Te sate te sate dek
So sad, at least it should be announced after the end of the season. However, we are very grateful to Klopp for all the wonderful stories. You will never walk alone.
We love you klopp we will always remember you thanks for winning the premier league under Liverpool’s name 😢😭
In Germany we call it:  „Mir kommen die Tränen“ 🥹
In Klopps words "its not what they think about you when you come, it what they think about when you leave." All LFC fans hold you in very high esteem❤
He is one of rarest of rare gem
Danke Jurgen... For everything!
Klopp is a legend, over 20 years a manager and won almost everything there is to win.   I think its obvious; Xabi Alonso is the future for LIV.
Bang, ya ampun bang 😭
He will be forever remembered and the amount joy he gave us is so special, Absolutely gutted with this news but respect your decision and good luck for your future Klopp 🇩🇪
Honest and humble Klopp is and always will be liverpool YNWA and thank you for everything and all the best for your future
Danke Jurgen... For everything!
Respectable, honest, exceptional, a man of integrity and honor. An example to leaders everywhere.
😢
So he will leave before the end of the season and sven goran eriksson will come in
When I saw this at first I thought it was a joke, but obviously it wasn’t a joke. This man created the most memorable, at least for me, Liverpool squad. This man is a legend and will go down as the best coach in BPL history. The magic this man created even when we weren’t at our best last season we still pulled through and did what we did. Bless this man and the work he’s done. Rest well captain. YNWA
Komm zu Bayern! ❤
We accept your decition Klopp, we'll just miss u, the team has to grow regladless, you was there in the right time, and the right time to leave is just your call. Thank u for everything 🥹
One of the Greatest managers LFC will ever see for a long time. Jurgen is the last of his kind who has helped make football for me full of spirit, interesting, fun, wild and unpredictable, given the current way the game of football is going or has gone, which is the opposite and soulless. Thank you Jurgen for everything you have given me as a LFC supporter to cheer for. I wish you the best for the rest of this season and for your bright future ahead of you, your staff and your family. You will be missed very much. ❤YNWA ❤
Damn bro this sucks
I am pretty sure Henry is to be blamed. Klopp brought players at the start of the season to build a new squad. Something has gone terribly wrong recently.
He will be remembered right along side Bob Paisley Bill Shankly as one of the greatest if not the greatest Liverpool Manager thank you Jurgen we love you love us it’s a beautiful thing YNWA! UP THE REDS!
This one hurts... it hurts deep.
Please, Liverpool, bring Xiba Alonso back to Anfield
Neutral here, I think he's got fed up of the modern game, stupid VAR decisions, stupid TV schedules, etc, looks like a man who has got out of prison, good bloke wish him the best.
❤
Even in a tough moment like this, The Normal One is always a gentleman. He deserves all the good thing in his life. Thanks for all you have done for this club. Let´s enjoy this months. Jürgen, you will never walk alone. RESPECT.
Should’ve just let klopp take a one year break and instil ljinders for the season.
It's Barcelona isn't it?
Will Klopp go out with a bang or a whimper.
I’m a massive Liverpool fan an I believe something has happened behind closed doors for him to walk away in the summer . He signed new contract not to long ago. Thanks for the memories Jurgen you made LFC great again ❤
Greatest manager alive! YNWA
Thank you Jurgen!!! We love you and we understand. We will miss you and never forget you. You brought the Premier League home! You made us the mentality monsters! We all believed on our day we can beat any team. Thank you Klopp. You will never walk alone. Wish you all the best. Lads, let’s send him out with a bang.
- We are here because you have an important message to deliver to our supporters. Would you like to tell them what that is? Klopp: Ah yeah, I have to... Uhm.. I will leave the club for Arsenal at the end of the season.
💔
my first thought was, well good for other teams to perhaps start be more competitive, 'good riddance' but on second thought it really makes me think what a beast this manager has been, he's proven his talent as in different places, he's definitely in the football history books, well done Mr Klopp
Why , Why 😭😭😭😭😭😭. I loved him even as a Bayern fan . I will be crying my eyes out on his last boom at Anfield
I love this man❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This breaks my heart I hope xabi alonso walks through as his replacement
Legend ❤ you will be missed boss.
Ain’t no laughing about it here the prem will miss you united fan
YNWA 😢
By the end of the season we gona set example to rest of the world . That we are Anfield and how much Liverpool , Anfield, and LFC fans loves klopp.. no one gona replace klopp, my heart is broke  in deep sadness.   But wish him best of luck for the furure.   You will never walk alone 😢
😮😮😮So Will Salah ,But Klopp wants to take the club to another level but the problem is the Owners dont want to invest as he wants
I am devastated and gutted beyond belief
Terimakasih untuk semuanya Klop selalu di hati liverpudlian
miss you klopp
YNWA Klopp. It’s been an amazing ride and thank you for all the memories. We’ve won 1 PL title while having 3 title winning seasons. Thank you for letting me experience the glory days again at Liverpool, ones that I thought were consigned to history.
This man exhibits everything amazing about football.
😢😢😢😢😢sad
I hope he goes somewhere where the owners value and cherish him
Reapect to JK, we 100% behind you and accepted your decision. Lets go out with a bang!
It's not time to say goodbye yet. but one thing is certain, Klopp is the best. The only coach who has a passion that is suitable for Liverpool FC  YNWA❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Of course we accept  Still very sad  But we accept!! Nothing but love and respect! Good luck figuring out what life is !!
To genuine local supporters who love their club. Its painful to see but life goes on. You have a giagantic club literally on your doorstep and you will continue to be successful in the future. Something us Geordies don't get enough of. Scousers are very similar to us. Wishing you the very best.
I hope when he goes and have beautiful normal life for 3/4 years and then come back for Liverpool again and stay beautiful with Liverpool forever.
I guess l have to respect and accept that Klopp is leaving Liverpool ,l will always cherish the memories, you are the best . All the best let’s finish this season in style create for memories
Oh My, what an incredible stunning Human. Thank you....❤
Farewell boss and thank you for everything you done here.
❤
This will be the end of Liverpool but Hope hope Liverpool choose Zidane or Mancini or simeoné after  klopp go!! Thats will be a big dramatic catastrophic in Liverpool.. Well good luck
Boss
Klopp is the best manager on the world.ynwa🦾
You'll Never walk Alone J.Klopp, you are the best Coach..❤
My heart is broken today. I alwas feared this day will come. Huge respect and round of applause for Klopp. He transformed a shattered Liverpool team into a world class team. He brought back the joy. There were dark days before him and honestly he kept his word and turned doubters into believers. I always backed him and wanted him to coach Liverpool one day. My God the years flew off so fast. I can’t believe it’s been 9 years. I will not say farewell for now cause he’s right the season is still going on and there’s still a lot to do. Let’s go for everything !
I think the close rivalry with Man City over the past 5 or so years caused a mental and physical burnout in Klopp. Class act, class manager and good luck for the future 👏
I wonder who the next manager of Germany will be ? 🤔
You are an amazing human.
How very professional, on and off the pitch.
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
What you expect from a class guy.. thank you Kloop for your service, we respect your decision .. let’s get behind kloop and team and win the league..let the others peddle the negativity.. YNWA.
ทั้งๆที่รู้ว่าเรื่องนี้ มันจะเกิดขึ้นกับพวกเราเเน่นอนในอนาคต เเต่ถึงเวลาที่มันมาถึงจริงๆ ฉันรับมันไม่ไหว มันเร็วเกินไปสำหรับพวกเรา มันเร็วเกินไปสำหรับคนที่พวกเรารักที่สุด ฉันอยากให้เรื่องทั้งหมดนี้เป็นเเค่ฝันร้าย
Why 😢😢😢
Thank You for everything what you did for us like Liverpool family ❤❤.I wish You all the very best in your new journey.All the best JK 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻.You are The Normal One …..👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Liverpool Till I Die ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥Forever 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You have done a great job. We, the Klopp, will never forget all the memories we shared together.YNWA🥹
Heartbroken but; this man is a role model. He showed up to a club that had lost its spark and reignited it, instilled the belief in the fans and players. What a man, absolute legend and not only that but a great person as well. He did what he set out to do and what he said he would do when he arrived. Best of luck in the future!! Danke Jurgen ❤❤
Stark👍
Just one word - heartbreaking!
Jürgen Nobert Klopp. You Will Never Walk Alone.
Respect ❤ shows how unique SAF was at United. Strange time tho, very strange timing. Hope it’s nothing family related.
OMG Thank you Thank you for all you have done. We will never forget you! In tears that i will not see this man after this Season. God Bless to Kloppo and his Family. YNWA
Wow just woke up to this news  i just want go back to bed and hope i was just dreaming. Gave this club its soul back and countless memories
Normal guy? No! You sir are a hero!!
after Bobby n then Jurgen.. 😔😔 Cant imagine his last game with liverpool.. Liverpool is not just football club, n his not just a manager for us..  Best wish for u Jurgen 🙏 ❤ from Indonesia fans  ❤YNWA
Klopp will be missed by all football fans not only Liverpool fans
I'm crying watching this, this is how much you mean to the fans. Thank you for everything and good luck going forward, YNWA.
Knew this will come but really...too soon!1 million volt shocker and jolt. But he is just another human being, energy can  diminish, can feel it has taken him a lot... Not easy as Liverpool boss. Yeah....fans, let him go..not that I like it
🥺😭
😢
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Noooooooooooooooooooooo
Get Gerrard in for a spell now after the season ends
Please Please write a book about your people management style. So that we can learn from the best high performing team.
As a United fan, I just have to pay my respects to Klopp. He's come into a club that were very up and down, constantly, for 20+ years, and he's re-established the club as one of the best in the world, for the better part of a decade. Not only that, but he's done it with some fantastic football, whilst always being a genuine, decent, fair human being on a personal level. The rivalry remains, but I'm sure the whole of the North West can agree, that we'll miss one of footballs best, when he leaves. Fair well, Jürgen, have a good rest, you deserve it for what you've brought to the game.
Thanks for everything Jurgen!!!!
Thanks and who will we be getting I wonder, maybe Xabi Alonso. Let's move on the club will always lose managers and players. But lets not delve in too much zzzz.
The best decision he has made and he has done it in the right time
He came, he saw, he conquered.   What a legend.
Cannot fathom this is happening. The best to ever built a club with such a tight budget. Knew this would come to an end someday, but not in a million years it will happen now 😢😓😓. You'll forever be our Jurgen. The best there is and will ever be. Thank you for all the memories Boss 😭😓🙏🙏🙏
…. And now I’m crying 😭
Cant wait to see Liverpool without Klopp
You have earned a place in my heart 😢😢
God bless you Kloppo! God bless you! You have been a blessing to us Liverpool fans! God bless you. I have no words, just be great and remember, YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE ❤
His the only coach i ever love and believe and trust in him for my favourite Club In the World God bless you Mr Kloop
Thank you Boss, best wishes. YNWA
I am not crying, it is just raining on the inside.
It is very suspicious situation..
One of the greatest managers to ever live. God we'll miss you jurgen
NO MANNN😭😭😭😭😭😢😣
We will miss you Jürgen...
Once you take mane, firmino and now salah away from klopp, sadly there is no more Liverpool for him
I am very devastated to hear the news that Klopp is leaving the club at the end of the season. 😢😢🙆‍♀️
One Of The Best Mangers We Have Ever Had
Jumping ship immediately because he knows liverpool is not going anywhere. Lol.
Seriously, Klopp means so much to me it’s crazy. It’s rare to see a coach having so much influence on the supporters😪💔
As a city fan, I won't miss him. As a Premier league fan, I will miss him.
Ich mag seine Bodenständigkeit und seinen Pragmatismus. Einer der besten Fußballtrainer der Welt und er weiß, es ist nur Fußball. Die Menschlichkeit ist das, was zählt. Ich ziehe meinen Hut 😊. Alles Gute
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE
We have to win the league now for Jurgen. What a legend😢😢❤❤
Absolute Legend.  He needs a statue, a stand naming after him and whatever else signals what he has done for LFC
United fan (don’t shoot). I really hope everyone in the game takes note of this. The world would be a better place if people understood where their limit is. It’s such an honest and humbling interview from a very honest man. Wish him all the very best for his break.
Was this real or an AI?
I've got no dog in the fight as I'm from London and a Millwall fan but as a football fan I am genuinely gutted. I absolutely love this guy, his character,  his humour,  his personality,  the way he gets Liverpool as a club and a city, and the blistering full throttle football he plays. He is just the absolutely guv'nor of a geezer and a manager. 🇩🇪
YNWA Alone. We are gutted but thats life. Thanks Jurgen. For everything. 😢
Something to me seems fishy,I dont know, him Pep ljinders, and all his backroom staff, including jorge schmadtke yhe sporting director are all leaving
You're a good man Jurgen, you've proved & brought changes to the rules of football, a spirited fighter. To end it please show how Liverpool were cheated out of winning the league many times by bad refereeing and the fraudulant management & owners of Manchester City.
Thank you so much coach Klopp,i hope you are ready for head coach of germany team for FIFA world cup 2026 glory.
Klopp has given the club more than anyone could have ever imagined. The club and the fans will never forget it. Seeing this interview shows his love, honesty and dedication for the club. After all these years, he more than deserves to make the decision step away. What an unbelievable guy. YNWA Jurgen ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jurgen. Gutted that he’s decided to leave. Wish him all the best in the future.  YNWA
Walk on klopp u will be missed 🫡
😢
We'll never find a man like this man, before Klopp Liverpool was a team a great one but just a team but Klopp made us a family and we'll never forget this, talk about leaving on a high note! You deserve the best Mr. Jurgen thank you for being my manager, thank you for the memories Y.N.W.A.
Best manager! No doubt. Really sad to hear that, of course. But he's right, it's better to leave now, then when it will be worse.  Definitely very emotional and stressful job. Especially without normal financial support from owners!   Unforgettable time together.. Simply the best coach in our new history... Forever in our hearts.  Herzlichen Dank Jürgen ❤
Nooo 😢😢😢
You will always be in the hearts of Liverpool fans forever❤❤
Lets go team and win the title this season for his farewell present..goodluck in the future klopp..we always love u and what u have done to this club..hearbreaking but accepted decision..love from lfc fan 🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾
As a Liverpool fan i will stop supporting this team It hearts more than anything
Gutted. I've only been a Liverpool supporter since 2002. So that makes this guy the best Liverpool related thing ever for me. Better than UCL 2005. Never thought anything can beat that. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart sir.
I am Gunner but big respect for this coach🙏
Plot twist He wants to go to Barcelona
「It’s only possible if you are busy and 1000 percent committed to everything u do 」 This part really get me cry.  😢
Klopp till 2025 plz make it a great decade instead
😢😢😢 you'll truly be remembered for turning Liverpool to the greatest height.YNWA💯
Thank you Klopp YNWA♥️♥️♥️
We will miss you Boss!! What a man..
Thanks for everything Klop. You will always have a special place at anfield. You will never walk alone
As fans of Liverpool, we will always be in Klopps debt. The things he's achieved, and we have achieved with him, are legendary, and the fact he was head to head vs a nation state breaching rules twice a day, just makes those achievements mean that much more..  we will love you to the end Jurgen. Thankyou for everything.  Every decision, every reaction, every situation, we will always be behind you.. in Klopp we trust YNWA 👐
Kloop is a true genius. Sad day. Hope he changes his mind.
😢😢😢noooooo
too bad i understand absolutely and completely how he feels but he thinks as if he was a young man in his head ,which worries me greatly. He has to take a long break but he will end up regretting it. I hope that he doesnt deteriorate after or during the break so he can go back to management
this is one of the worst days of my life
I Am not A Liverpool but i Love Klopp and i Have a lot of respect for Him exceptionnal Manager Sad about his departure i Hope the end Will be incredible to finish in the best Way his adventure
All the best ❤
Virgil Van Dijk Trent Alexander Arnold  Mohammad Salah Alisson Becker  James Milner Jordan Henderson Fabinho Divock Origi Andrew Robertson  All Players You Gave Created At Liverpool Have A Brilliant Life :)
Thank you for everything. Jergen Klopp😢
Jurgen klopp stand, statue outside  stadium. Legend!
Feels like Xabi Alonso next, right?  Klopp is a gem of a manager and human being (from an Arsenal fan)
Good man. The best to ever do it, along with our other all time great coaches.
The normal one? Nah. The special one.
I love you, Jurgen, from this Man City fan.  I loved you when I watched you manage Borussia Dortmund.  I was so hoping you would manage Man City, but, alas, Liverpool was graced with your presence.  You are such a wonderful, competent person, while radiating  kindness.  You will be sooooo missed.   I wish you and your family much health and happiness.🥰  Thank you for being you.🙏❤  You will never walk alone.👼
😭😭😭😭
Nooooooo!
Here goes our downfall 😢
Xabi will replace him
play ball never give up
Lvpl manager goat!! Thanks!!
Heartbroken 😭😭😭😭
I honestly can't miss any of our upcoming games now as I know it's the last time we'll see klopp and will enjoy it till it lasts,  But still am 😭😭
I can't stop crying never wanted this day to come we love you klopp thanks for everything your one of our best managers ever once a red always a red YNWA ❤️
tbh he got offer from the saudi lmao 😂
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
We need to win everything now as a final gift to the gaffer! GOAT! A once in a lifetime manager that we were lucky to get
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you for everything Jurgen thank you helping us win everything in football you'll be missed YNWA
Klopp please don't go😭😭💔💔💔
Honestly heartbreaking never thought this day would ever come ❤️‍🩹
imagine i’m on my way home from a funeral and i check my phone and see this
Amen it was about time this fraud left
Thank you Klopp ❤❤ You'll never walk alone!!
I'm shocked, and feel gutted. Klopp is Liverpool for me these past years. He brought back greatness. Sincerely hope all is OK with him. YNWA 😢
😥
It's amazing how you have never met someone but they can have such a profound influence on your life. Yet the love I have for this man is something I hope to be able to tell him someday. Knowing the nature of my job, it is quite possible our paths will cross. The last time i shed a tear was when my beloved father passed away last year. Another tear dropped today. An expression of grief and loss. And love. For a man who gave millions so much by just merely doing his job and breathing. Thank you Herr Jurgen Norbert Klopp. You'll Never Walk Alone.
Streaming down my cheeks 😢
As a Chelsea fan i'd really like to say i admire all you have accomplished .. goodluck on your next journey 🤝
How long does it take that Liverpool supporters find the right one for them for the club. We found him and keep looking for another successes and more trophies. However, we love you and respect your decision.   We will keep following you and glad with your future success and new adventure.   THANK YOU for being JK of Liverpool 😊
I think the support from other clubs is whats going to make this emotional. We all know how the scousers feel right now. We know how Jurgen feels. But wait until you see how many clubs and their fan bases are going to feel some sort of dread that he's leaving. Massive bloke, absolutely top class lad and a massive massive inspiration. Perfectly handled by boss and Board. YNWA! Glory to Christ
Thank you boss for everything you did❤YNWA
BUILD THE STATUE
Come olympiacos f.c
One of the best
Cảm ơn Boss vì những gì đã làm cho đội bóng, cho tất cả những Fan hâm mộ như chúng tôi được thấy bóng đẹp, tinh thần bất khuất và những chiến thắng vô cùng ngoạn mục. Thời điểm này quá nhạy cảm và bất ngờ, chắc không chỉ tôi mà rất nhiều người sẽ buồn vì sắp mất đi linh hồn của đội bóng, những cú đấm tay vào không trung. Quá buồn và hụt hẫng. Nhưng hơn tất cả, tôi tin tưởng vào khả năng thay người của Boss. Tôi tin rằng quyết định này của ông là tốt cho đội bóng hơn cả cho cá nhân ông.( có thể đau lòng vì sự bất công hay sự không công bằng hiện tại hay quá khứ nhưng đó là điều luôn sảy ra trên thế giới theo cách nào đó, nhưng tất cả chúng ta đều yêu mến người hùng và ghét bỏ cái ác, cái bất công. Nó cần phải dẹp bỏ) Cảm ơn Boss vì tất cả, chúc ông mạnh khoẻ và hạnh phúc. YNWA!
Legend!!!!
After all these comeback these season,😔,
Why Klopp? The team just started to build up the momentum
Watching this is making me so sad 😓
the worst birthday present I've ever had...
Leaving at the top.
I knew this day will come but I’m still not ready. 😢
I was relieved to hear it wasn't for medical reasons. The man deserves a golden statue outside our stadium
Klopp will always be a red, one of the best managers in premier league history, in the world even.
A good dancer knows when's best to leave the stage. Let's see how our brothers Liverpool deal with a new coach like Chelsea has in the last seasons. Man city in the same tunnel 😢. Blues we went through it,we standing again against all odds.
Nothing but love for you, Jürgen. YNWA
Fighting back the tears... I know he thinks he knows, but honestly, I think he's underestimating just how much proper love we have for him... I've supported Liverpool for over 40 years , and even I will say, klopp is Liverpool, Liverpool is klopp! You're breaking our hearts Jurgen... YNWA (Thank you!)
YNWA klopp 👏 🙌  the greatest manager I had the pleasure to watch a beautiful humble being I wish you nothing but respect and good wishes in your future x
Not even a Liverpool fan but you have to respect what he has done in the Premier League against a cheating Manchester City to contend with, it's one thing to win trophies but it's another to do it against a team who's cooking their books and paying off the refs.  Technically two when you remember Chelsea are cheats as well.
As Always another great decision by Klopp. The BEST.
Aku menyukaimu sir
Our best manager since Bob.Thank you for everything Jurgen it's been emotional.Good luck for the future.YNWA
I can't watch this to the end, it's so hard.😭
He’s up there with Shankly and Paisley. “ He made the people happy”. Legend.
From a united fan you will be missed, i hope you go out with silverwear, well deserved. respect
A honest man, with a brilliant football mind.  The biggest thing is for the fanbase to not compare his replacement to him.  He has set the bar high to all managers of the world.  Respect his decision, and pay tribute to a great man.
Good! We NEED someone new, someone fresh. Thanks Klopp, but it was INDEED time to step aside. Wish him all the best with the german national team!
Pure Class !!
Liverpool daddy,I know its a hard decision to make,but you comes first,you owe yourself the break❤,love you Klopp.  we'll never walk alone. am so glad Jurgen is a Red.
A lot of people think that announcing this now could have a negative impact on the season and it could....I really hope that it goes the opposite way, especially at Anfield. Every game should be a homage and celebration of this mans era. Every game should have the atmosphere of a CL semi final because what more fitting of an end to have this mans last game at Anfield end with him holding the Premier League title above his head.
"I write as a huge Real Madrid fan, and I can only speak words of praise for this icon. Klopp is a great man and coach, and I wish him all the best in whatever comes next!"
The normal one... ❤❤ YNWA Klopp Red forver
Klopp thank you so much for everything. Theres truly no words to describe how incredible and amazing youve been at Liverpool. Thank you for everything. Balling my eyes out and i cant even imagine how imagine how emotional its going to be at the last game in anfield😢😢😢.YNWA❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love Jurgen Klopp in EVERY WAY. He’s the best manager and a great person.
Please, No!  I have been a fan of Klopp since the Dortmund days, huge respect.  You will be missed. Love and respect from Birmingham, Alabama.  You'll Never Walk Alone.
NOTHING BUT LOVE AND RESPECT FOR YOU MR KLOPPS ❤⚪🔴 YOU ARE A TRUE G.O.A.T IN THE BUSINESS. 🏆🐐🥇
LEGEND. Much respect for the honesty. And just teaching me that there is a time to decide to leave.
Tears, man. You don’t have to explain yourself, thanks for your honesty and great joy you brought to all of us. Now let’s focus on the remaining games this season and finish strong 💪
Full respect to him for his decision. Best LFC manager and one of the best managers i've seen in my lifetime. He deserves a massive thanks for everything he has done for the club. Lets have a strong finish to the season and see if we can change a few more of those numbers on the wall! YNWA
Thank you Jürgen, for what u did to the club, greatest memories will remains all time...legend..YNWA..
Not the news I needed to hear first thing in the morning (here in the States). There will always be a special place in Liverpool and our hearts for this man. Fist pump, fist pump, fist pump! YNWA
How much to bet we win sod all this season now.
Hi, definitely a big loss but life goes on, wish him well n take care of himself ,no looking back for liverpool will never walk alone. YNWA.
Thank you for the 9 years with us we wish you a very successful life after this devastating news we will miss you a lot we hope a successful life once again and nobody will replace Klopp you will be the best manager in the world and if we don’t see a statue we will all be depressed as without Klopp Liverpool is nothing we will miss you 😭😭😭😭😭😭 We hope the us Liverpool fans and this was devastating news and nobody will replace you bye Jurgen Klopp we hope a miracle happens and you stay 😭😭😭😭
Somethings in life really hurt. This is one of them things   We have been lucky to have Jurgen but how do replace such a special and brilliant manager.   Nothing but love and thanks for returning our club to its rightful place   I’ll always hope this changes but you have to respect his decision
The philosophy of Jürgen is not just about football but it's a great life lesson Thank you Klopp
Sedih weih tengok ni sampai habis. Ayat-ayat dia memang deep. Kalau saya tak ada energy macam mana saya nak bagi 100% komitmen.. Deep.. Thanks Juergen Klopp!!
Great timing klopp. Going great this season. Then this comes out. Won't win anything now.
I accept it❤
I'll miss him but need to give him more 🏆
I think you did us bad not to keep it until season endings . Now that this message is out I can bet you the team may not be able to keep momentum. They will start dropping points
Have to get to Anfield now before he leaves
This man’s destined for the Germany job! They need him but Asa lifetime LFC Itsa bitter pill to swallow. Bring on Alonso.
There’s a job going as Prime Minister, if you’re free. You are the greatest living Englishman. You and Jeremy
Always been a Kloppo fan when he left Dortmund it felt this way so I feel for Liverpool fans. This man is still as humble as ever, goodluck Kloppo!
17:11  I’m in tears 😭 I was so mad at him leaving but I have to let him go … Love you Jurgen ❤
I really hope they make a statue of him gripping his fist towards the stand at the end of every match. That would be great
Jurgen is not just the manager of my most favourite football club... Jurgen is the epitome of what it is like to be the most ideal human being.  Thank you so much kloppo for all the beautiful memories, the beautiful moments and for teaching me how to be a proper human being.   All your words, your quotes, your thoughts... have contributed to many many many people becoming better humans.  We will miss you so so much!   the tears cant stop falling!
Stunned, unable to speak, numb all over It's like being dumped in front of you. Without me being able to prepare myself.
What a great man, you'll be remembered and loved forever. Thank you Jürgen.
YNWA Klopp thanks for giving this city its love of footy.. It was YOU who made anfield a scary place for other clubs to come was YOU who made Liverpool atmosphere world famous again.. Lastly just thank you love u klopp
Hope we can get xavi alonso
Nothing but love for you Jurgen. Thank you for all that you have done for us. All the best for your future.
To sum up Klopp's tenure that comeback against Barcelona is what he brought back to Liverpool, the steel, the grit, the never say die attitude. We will miss you Jurgen and your fist pumping. Enjoy your next steps wherever that may be!
When you quit your job and 700K people are watching your exist interview in the first 3 hours , there must be something special about you.
Danke für alles Jürgen Es isch nid nur Fuessball und du hesch und zeigsch das jede Daag❤, danke Boss
Please take over psg
I dont wanna watch this.
loves this man what a legend greatful for all hes done for and with us
Thanks you My Boos  I Love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🐐 YNWA and you will forever be my hero in this club Jürgen… He literally revived the club
We as Liverpool, a stand for jurgen klopp is a must❤
Worst news we could get 😢 Never going to be the same without him
Окей,вы правы как никогда: Юрген Клопп был,есть и будет!!! Классный тренер и отличный мужик!!!
I really devastated after i see news in Facebook fabrizio romano page 😢 💔 😔 to speak honestly you are my goat as a manager and you will be forever
Pure Class!  Vielen Dank, Jurgen.
I woke up, turned on my computer saw that’sfootball say Klopp Quit Liv n was like what is wrong with this dude n always trying to get traffic off crazy headlines the I saw Fabrizo Ro short vid. This is the saddest thing to wake up to n I feel we are going to be Lost again for years.  I am crying rn. What did we do wrong Klopp?
I am a blue but this one touched my balls, I will miss the crazy Chelsea-Liverpool moments 😢
Gracias eternas Jurgen
Dank you klopp
Jurgen you have given me tons of moments throughout your stay here at Liverpool which I can consider to be one of the best moments of my life. You were not just a manager for us but even more like a father for us and taught us a lot in the process and for that I cant thank you enough for it , you deserve the absolute best this world has to offer my gaffer,  we really love you and respect your decision fully. But as you said we will stand alongside the team and we will fight for absolutely everything this season , our full relentless support is 100% guaranteed. we love you  Jurgen !!!  YNWA
this actually breaks my heart
Well spoken.  All good. Things come to an end sometimes.
Boss❤
Big like for the Real German  Thats what i like as a migrant in the german mentality  Respect to JURGEN KLOPP ❤ He have all our respect (personal &professional) our Hearts with him authentic and always saying the truth, our minds with the crazy moments we lived with our club through him and with him managing this to happen. You Won everything Jurgen  Everyone and everything Wallah❤😊
It’s hurts even though being a Man U fan can’t imagine what Liverpool fans might be feeling
Timing feels odd, but maybe this lights an even bigger fire under the players, "One last go-round" for Klopp. On one hand, you could see Liverpool winning the league with insane emotion and passion but if the players flame out, could you look back on this and say that Klopp lost the dressing room with such a decision? We'll see 😬
No man, we should fight to retain this guy....😢😢
What a coach, man! He understands what he means to his team, club and the people of Liverpool and treats them with the utmost respect and love.  Rooting for you always, Jurgen! Whatever you do next, give them trouble!
Thank you my coach.
Respect and love, Jurgen. thank you for everything that you have done for us. ❤
thats a real coach
Wolves fan here, all I can say is what a guy what a top top manager and he has put Liverpool back where they belong, gutted the premier will lose this manager as he is elite imo and I wish him every success in whatever he does. 🫶🏼
😢😢😢
would be good to leave by wining the Premiership with fans in the stadium. Did well. Tough to battle ever year against Pep with his financial backing.
As a 56 year old liverpool supporter I must say I am gutted today. I started supporting Liverpool when I was 4 years old when my mother bought me a School bag with liverpool fx written on it. I lived the dream in the 70,s and 80, S and idolised Kenny Dalglish and pretended I was him when out kicking a ball around with the other kids. I never thought I'd see the likes of those days again.. But Jurgen brought them back. What a manager, an inspiration and a thoroughly decent human being. Thank you Jurgen. And YNWA
what a manger 👏👏
YNWA Jürgen. You treated our club, and our city, like family. I'll miss you like family. Thank you for everything you did these past few years, and will do this season, for Liverpool. Whereever you go, you'll always be one of us la. YNWA
Me & Jurgen will be missed, we’ve achieved so much for the club and it will be a shock for the fans, but we’ve had so many triumphs. Will miss the fans and the club. ❤
His mental health comes first what a great manager. What a great person. What a great example.
YNWA JURGEN THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING ❤😢
welcome to old trafford?
Dont be sad because its ending... Be glad because it happened
Danke Kloppo.
Respect ✊ to Kloop such a legend of a manager,  Oxford fan.
So scared of Johnny Rowe dumping his side out of the cup he's leaving. OTBC! 💛💚. Fair play to Klopp. Only a select few get to leave on their own terms.
😢😢😢😢😢
😢😢❤
Thank you for all the memories.  Now i need a klopp hug.
Jürgen Klopp is simply the best coach in the world. If you look at what he achieved in Mainz, Dortmund and Liverpool it is simply incredible.  One day he will coach a national team. Maybe England or Germany.  All the best for the future.
Klopp please😢😢 don't leave you are one of the best couches and Liverpool needs you
nooooooooo
Example of a real Man. Much, respect and admiration from Portugal, Mister Jurgen Klopp. Thank you.
Sad that Jurgen is leaving. Thanks for everything and wish you all the best for the future. Legend
Best in the world👊🏻
UMMM NO SIRRR YOU ARE STAYING :((
What a legend❤
He is so honest and wholesome
I love you like my grandfather
My God this is the worst news I have heard in two decades of my life supporting Liverpool football club.
أخترت العربية لأكتب تعليقي علي قرار كلوب  ... أنا حزين لكنني أدرك أن هناك مبررات كافية ، بالنسبة له ، لاتخاذ هكذا قرار ! أتمني له التوفيق علي الأصعدة كافة  .  Danke  aus kairo   .
Danke Kloppo. I never thought I could love a Liverpool Manager more than Kenny, but you've done it. You and the teams you built have been responsible for some of the happiest moments I've experienced. It's been a massive pleasure to know that you have contributed to our illustrious history.
Am a United fan and I’m gutted, god knows how lufc fans are feeling, looking watching him walking the pitch class act
we love you we owe you.......thank you Klopp for everything❤❤
It feels like someone from my family is leaving, and I can't do anything about it. Thank you Jurgen for making us fans dream again❤
saya masih belum memahami , kenapa klopp memutuskan untuk meninggalkan liverpool fc
I would argue that you can clearly see how much Klopp loves Liverpool FC. His honesty as well as the timing to notify everyone about his decision clearly spells this out. The fact that he noticed that he doesn't have the kind of energy to be able to continue managing the club in a way that would be beneficial for the team is indicative of that. To fans and the general public, his decision to quit managing seems to be sudden, but as we heard, he has been pondering this since at least November of last year.   I believe that this announcement came with the best interest of the club in mind. The fact that Klopp was going to be leaving at some stage in the future was inevitable, but this gives them time to plan for the continuity, for the next stage in the life of the club.  It seems to me that he doesn't see himself as the right man to continue bringing about the kind of results that he managed to bring about because he is no longer like what he used to be which was the catalyst for Liverpool's success.   The majority of the players are still young, and they will adapt well. I am sure that he will be working with them to prepare them for what is coming up next. If he told them at the end of the season, that would definitely be too much of a shock for them. Moreover, it would leave too much of a big hole to fill in too little time to fill it. It is a big hole to fill anyhow, but like I said earlier, at least they have time to think and plan and make a decision as to who can take over.   I would argue that Liverpool will need someone experienced but young enough, who has the necessary energy and drive to be able to implement specific changes that will facilitate certain growth without killing the new identity that Klopp managed to create and foster within the club, which is based on the kind of energetic style of play that made it into a successful club once again.  For this reason, I would argue that the next manager will need to have the necessary managerial and football nouse to be able to take them on to new heights without feeling the need to completely change Liverpool's style of play.
2 Words Xavi Alonso
Winning is difficult, the reality is that he is drained, he will go on and train elsewhere he is just tired of training Liverpool
Why is his team of assistants also leaving, that sounds as if he has  something already lined up to me. He surely needs a year off. I'm confused.
Anyone got a spare tissue. YNWA.
Thank you, Jürgen Klopp, for your unwavering passion, leadership, and dedication to Liverpool Football Club. Your impact on the team and the fans will be remembered with deep gratitude. Best wishes on your next journey
So few athletes or managers know when to retire on top. This great man does. He will be greatly missed on the pitch each game. Enjoy a wonderful life free of Futbol. You deserve it. All the best Jurgen.
Wow! I can’t believe it! Damn, he’s a legend! We are going to miss him! He will always be Liverpool’s aspiration.
Getting to know this club under his leadership has been one of the great joys of the past three years, and of course for most fans it's been much longer. People who say the club will remain the same don't understand the game. So it is very sad. But he's certainly earned some rest and our gratitude. Let's help him win it all and leave like no manager ever left a club, at the absolute pinnacle of success.
Gutted.
It will be the worst and the worst of 2024.
happy to get rid of klopp only complains when things don't go his way there are plenty of others who do a better job than him. he will not be missed
This ONE HURTS 😔
YNWA
Jürgen, take your hiatus. Go on holiday, see the world or just be in hibernation until your batteries are charged up again... But... PLEASE COME BACK AFTERWARDS!
감독님 덕분에 너무 행복했습니다❤
YNWA
😢......thats all I can say
YNWA❤️⚡️💯
😱😱😱😱
Before Klopp came to Liverpool I was never a fan. I was not even a fan of football, but all that was about to change. Having grown up in London , I was on the wrong end of the stick for being born a German. Despite that I never hated the English. I just wished that the English (and not just them) would accept me and Germans in general again one day, and when Liverpool started reaping its rewards under Klopp it looked like the general attitude was starting to change for the better. I thought I would lose interest in Liverpool once he goes, but something tells me that I'm kinda stuck with you guys now 🙂. By rights I should be a Bayern Munich fan as a Bavarian, but life is funny that way. I am now a part of Jürgen's legacy for this amazing club. YNWA ! ❤
Incredible psychology. The players, fans are now gonna be louder, play better and win the prem.
“It’s not important what people think when you come in, it’s much more important what people think when you leave.”   - Jurgen Klopp, 2015
I wish I hadn't clicked on this video.😢
We love you jurgen, we do OHHHH jurgen we love you
April fools… pls 😭
Nothing lasts forever
Legend ❤

Stunned by the news. Thank you for guiding LFC to where we belong. Let’s battle on and give you the farewell you deserve. YNWA from Singapore
My weekend is ruined.. for the coming years. Will not be the same again for every late morning matches
Dear boss jurgen I am sure about that you choose the best desicion for us Liverpool will always be proud of you❤❤❤❤
This is the worst video I’ve ever watched on YouTube for the last ten years … good luck boss .. you will be back here less than 5 years
I was big fan of his Dortmund team and I was over the moon when he signed for us. I know I will be following the next team he manages, if he decides to come back. I'm sad but grateful for all the things we achieved together. Danke Jürgen !
So sad😢
End of a fckin era! I started watching Football in 2015 all the way to now. Its been 9 years, and this man has been a highlight. There's so many moments I have been thrilled by, and Klopp was part of so many of them! Klopp leaving Liverpool makes me emotional, and I don't even support Liverpool.
I wish him all the best..He as given the Club is all...Thank you so much..
We are lucky to have you in the club, the best manager in the world. We will miss you.😢😢
😭😭
Dieser Kommentarbereich ist nun Eigentum der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: (Klopp wir lieben dich ❤)
It had to come sometime. Jurgen, thank you for the ride. I wish you and your family everything that you want yourselves for the future. You will be sorely missed. Come back and visit whenever you can. You know that you and Ulla will never walk alone. 🤩
No way
He came, he saw, he conquered
"Smart business" model is what made such a passionate man lose all his energy!  I may oversimplify, but it made me so mad, when this man, our coach, had to smile time and time again, saying that "no transfers" are all good, that young boys can take on the roles of world class players, that healthy business is the right way to do things. And all this while he saw his counterparts spend all the money in the world, getting the best players, replace them after a season, and buy other ones.  The man got tired of making miracles come true.
His eyes! He looks like 10 years older than he is! 😯
not a liverpool fan, but people dont realize yet how much of a legend he is. he will go into the list of wenger and furgeson as the all time great managers in the PL. what a lovely guy and what a legend, he will be sorely missed by all fans
you did more than expected that's why you don't owe anything to us You Will Never Wolk alone JK Forever Legend🥰😍🤩😘
Noooo😢 This guy has made me the happiest I've been in years...I need to go back to bed and wake up again! This feels like a nightmare..Wait is it 1st April Already!!Dam I wish him all the best Whatever he does do.❤
Jürgen, we love you, thanks for all we will miss you ❤
ㅜㅜ 클롭이 있어서 행복했습니다.
Jürgen Norbert Klopp he will say goodbye to Liverpool this summer but one thing i know for sure,he will NEVER EVER say goodbye to our hearts and souls,love you,Jürgen!😢😢😢❤❤❤
😦😭😭😭
We the Kopites respect your reasons Jurgen. We understand . We wish you all the very best in the future. Take your break from football. You have deserved it. When your tank is full then go and do your next thing and manage your national team . You are Liverpool in this space right now. And always remember. YNWA.
I'm not crying, you're crying
This is really? 😢
Im so devastated...the way i cried today at work after hearing this sad news...i just hope this could push the players to win more trophies for him...But i think this is the rite time to announce this bcz we as Liverpool are still in good form rather then announce it when things doesn't work out for us on the pitch....YNWA
What a shocking News is THAT!
YNWA ❤
I can’t believe this video Boss I will always miss you  God bless you
Love this man!
What a man..what a manager. LEGEND
an unbelievable good coach. As a German I can say, he's one of the best Germany ever had. This message even shocked me, because you have to name Liverpool and Klopp in one sentence. Great time, from a mid class PL team, at the time he came, to the best. What a run from our man❤
We are truly lucky to have had the pleasure of having Jurgen Klopp manage Liverpool FC. He rebuilt the team into its former glory, challenging for cups and titles. All the supporters of this magical football club will miss you. '' I'm so glad that Jurgen is a red! ''.
Such a Great Loss to the EPL, Thank You Jurgen for Everything!
Sad.
Klopp i will miss your comeback matches for me you are one of the best manager ever to be in football and when you leaves in Liverpool you are not a just manager but now you are an emotion,energy and happiness to all the Liverpool supporters and no one in this world can replace you and takes away your place from our heart and in Last I wanna say that you are a goated manager for me and gigan pressing you teach will always be remembered
Special manager and even better human being. YNWA Jurgen! Let's finish the season strong 💪🏾
'A normal life'.  "I just want to give it a try before it's too late".  I'm sure you'll be great at that too. Best of luck, from a CPFC fan.
Heartbroken but nothing but 100% respect for Klopp, he even leaves with class, I wish this wasn't happening but it's life, I wish Klopp and his family all the best for the future YNWA ❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢 WHY YOU LEAVING
the normal one needs some well needed rest
😢
I am shattered Klopp leaving us ( Liverpool)
ขอให้โชคดีนะบอส🥺♥️
Our General Our King YNWA 🔴❤️💪
Arsenal fan here, Klopp is a legendary manager, one of the best and most beloved managers. I hope he can get some rest after he leaves. Xabi Alonso to come home?
My heart is broken but he has won everything you could possibly win as a football coach of our great club  He will always be Liverpool and Liverpool will always love our coach
Xabi Alonso should replace him?
Respect.  Because he knows no one will sack him, hes gonna do it himself. Wow.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Jürgen, thank you for coming into this club and make the fans believe again. I wish for you all the good things and happiness for whatever you be taking on after LFC.
Who else hopes this is an AI fake?
This is a big blow for football, Arsenal fan. I'm more saddened than happy, can't imagine how Liverpool fans are feeling. Devastating
Best manager in football facts
Klopp is one of the most excellent football managers and human beings of all time.  God bless you and your family, Jurgen, now and in your future endeavours.
Good luck BOSS. Thank you so. YNWA to JK 🤟💞
Hard one to swallow lump in throat
please dont 😭😭😭
I thougth you were there JK.
Jürgen, you are Liverpool. We are Liverpool. Understand the decision you made but hard to accept it really. Y.N.W.A.
thank you Jurgen your family deserves your time we are eternally grateful God bless you and your family for the future
A very sad day for all of us, but thank you for everything Jurgen. You have made Liverpool great again, it’s been such a pleasure being a supporter during your tenure. YNWA.
Im a Chelsea fan and im gutted hes leaving the Premier league, its been a place where top drawer managers come and if your not top level u will get found out. Klopp is elite level if pep wasnt around he would be out there on his own but for me he is in the same group as Wenger Fergie Jose pep etc, sad to see him go i would say its a bit like when Jose left us its like loosing a loved one or a partner i would say Liverpool remember the good times. Real football fans and me salute you sir, respect is due and definitely certified.
What a sad day for Liverpool football club, I wish you wouldn't leave klopp, you have brought Liverpool fc back too the top of English football and I thank you for that, this is not just sad news for Liverpool fc but for the whole of the Premier league. ❤
This news hurt me but I’m understanding  where he come from, everybody in one point in life have to let go and this it’s nothing different for everyone,he is a human  and he want to do some different with his life, it’s 100% understandable, thanks for all the joy and all the time i had on your side wish you the best in your new journey, love your desires, love you new chapter on life I mean I love you like always I did, good luck Juergen and enjoy your new life ❤😂😢🎉😊
I am sad. But respect with your decision coach!
Thank you JURGEN KLOPP. You'll Never Walk Alone
im crying... the most beautiful coach in the world. we love you and we will love you kloppo! you will never walk alone thank you for everything
Thank you legend ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏❤️❤️
PLEASE JURGEN DONT GO!! you're breaking every liverpool fans heart
Be playing the dirty mackems in the championship b4 yous know it 😂😂 UP THE TOON
SOMETHING MUST HAVE BEEN HAPPEN WITH THE OWNER...HEARD ALL HIS STAFF ALSO GOING ..IS THAT TRUE?😭😭😭😭😭
Gerraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddd!!!!!!!!
You made us believe again. Dankeschön Herr Klopp,  You'll Never Walk Alone.
Thank you for everything, Jurgen! YNWA!! ❤
Didn't believe it until i saw the news.. Woooow question now is whos gonna take ova..
Jurgen, where do you want your statue?
When Klopp said “We are Liverpool” at the end, I got chills. Let’s win the lot this season!
He's the 🐐. He will be missed
Why Klopp why😢😢 please stay for 2/3 years my heart 💔💔😫😭😭😭😭
Perfect example of exemplary management from start to finish. Klopp will always be loved LFC and beyond.
Klopp always will be a red and whatever you do next YNWA❤
We will miss him
Always knew this day would come one day, but still can't help feeling sad about it. Thank you KLOPP. Wish u all the best in your future endeavors.
Bitter sweet as a rival, The prem is losing a top top addition to the league & I hope his health is all good.
Even when you're struggling to accept the fact that you're growing older and less energetic, you're concerned of us, you care about our future, you care about how we conceive your decision and that's the highest form of caring and being there for us right at this moment.  Thank you Mr. Klopp for inspiring everyone, for bringing us down to earth with your humble stance and words time and time again whilst achieving greatness! You're a great human being, I hope you figure life out! YNWA❤
That’s so painful  You were every thing , Thank you so much ❤ YNWA
The reason must be you've bought two bad players. Nunez and Gakpo and so any future signings would be to replace these and that is not a palatable thing to do.
Hope he goes to Real Madrid for his legacy. He would win everything there.
Why do I feel like to cry especially 8:25
The players owe him another league title. Will miss him. This hits hard.... YNWA Jürgen Best manager next to shankly and paisley. Build him a statue
I feel sick thank you so much KLOPP from giving me so much joy I’m 27 and you gave me my first prem league cup and my second champions league cup let’s close your Legacy with a bang KLOPP you will be in my heart till I die thank you for everything you’ve done ❤
I saw this news as I woke up. 5am in California. I thought I was dreaming. Every game going forward will be extra special.
mann please dont leave .. i started supporting liverpool back then after you came ..this team has been an emotion for us
I'm a Man United fan, but I've always respected & admired Klopp. He is one of the best coaches in football & I wish we found him first. Sad to hear you're leaving, but I understand you have to take care of you. Your passion & honest are to be treasured. Wish you all the best in whatever you chose to do it the future; hats off.
omg omg 😭😭 forevel grateful to him
City fan here, Klopp is a top legend of the game and deserves a statue outside Anfield even I’m sad not because how great he was a manager but what a top man this guy is he deserves the rest he wants and I hope him all the best thanks for the amazing battles we had with you all these years and I hope you find happiness and peace within yourself.
Not a Liverpool supporter but a huge fan of this man; as a person and as a couch. He leaves his long-lasting imprint on the Premier league. Will not be the same without him. I think Pep will do the same.
Arsenal supporter here. This man is a top G! Best of luck for whatever he decides to do next! Will be a dogg fight the rest of the season let's go!!!
So sad.😢😢.. Is it for coaching Germany ?
Jurgen Klopp is the epitome of Liverpool Football Club. YNWA Kloppo ❤️.
So that’s why the squad is giving like 280% at every game
Alonso should be the next manager he’s ready made for it
This AI thing is crazy 😳
Legend ❤❤ YNWA
I am absolutely gutted.... I feel for the manager that has to follow his lead. If ever these players needed a reason to fight with their all this is it!  One of the leagues greatest managers of all time! Will be a massive loss.
LOVE, DUNCAN ❤🎉
Can anyone blame him, the pressures on modern day managers with hardly any preseason, social media etc, it's crazy
please come to barca !
U'r z best manager in z world.. u can still change ur mind.. supporter of lfc 35+ yrs.. actually wn u were @ dortmund i was ur fan.. were really happy wen u came 2 lfc.. but really sad u'r leaving..
💔 Was not emotionally prepared for this.
Jurgen , YNWA mate !! You are and always will be a legend alongside  Bill Bob And Kenny   Thanks for the entertainment   Let’s finish off by getting the title ❤❤❤
Thank you Klopp! Thank you for ALL the memories and there are many! I will miss your style of play, your genius. You will forever be a legend. Thank you Klopp, I wish you all the best, whatever you decide to do.
Respect Von Klopp , we understand that one does need to charge one’s batteries and often we ask what when this is over. Where to from here. Go with Blessings Juergen. You did far more than was expected under the pressurised circumstances you faced on a daily basis. Enjoy your life outside the game you earned it. Thank you, thank you.
Good luck Jürgen!
I usually don't have a favorite Prem team, but I'll be rooting so hard for LFC this season. The Klopp era at Liverpool deserves to end with as many titles as possible. Go win the Euro League Treble, guys!
I respect your decision Jurgen. Do what's best for you. You don't owe the club or the supporters anything. You can walk away knowing you gave absolutely everything you could.  Now I hope we just win it for you and send you off in a bang. YNWA
City fan here and just want give massive props and respect to Klopp.  Absolute top manager who pushed City right to the end for the league titles and I will be very sad to see him leave at the end of the season.   His touchline enthusiasm will always be unmatched and I actually had a lump in my throat as I watched this video.
no 😭😭, everyone can go as long as it's not Jurgen Klopp please you are a legend you can 😭😭💔💔
welcome to newcastle😊
Oh no
Great manager makes me think how lucky we was to have sir alex, he brought liverpool back and turned them in to a beast respect to klopp.
We know you're sick 😫
Danke Jürgen 💚💚💚🙏
Not even a Liverpool fan but thanks for the entertainment Jurgen ❤
I’m crying man  I was 10 when Jurgen took over ironically I wrote a letter to Rogers and day I’d sent it we sacked him and I was gutted lol but was happy when we got him thinking I’d be happy if he consistently got us into UCL did not imagine us winning as many trophies as we have they’ll be tears that last game for sure
YNWA. Thank you for everything Klopp ❤
😢
Bring him back when he is ready to go again. I cant describe this pain. It's like when somebody revealed to you that your loved one just passed away. This announcement has traumatized me.
Wasn't expecting this at all, wish it wasn't happening for another couple years but thanks for all you've done for the club 🙌🏿 certainly the best manager we've had in my era of supporting Liverpool FC YNWA‼️‼️
What an absolutely amazing manager he has been. Passion, commitment and absolute love for everything Liverpool. He will be sorely missed but it's so refreshing to actually see the other side of a manager leaving of their own accord and not being sacked. Very rare in football. Thanks for everything you have done and wish him nothing but the best for his future.
With Klopp at Liverpool, I have learned to believe even in the face of despair. What a manager! What a human! You will dearly be missed, but before then, you have my full respect and support as we keep going to make more good history for liverpool! Gratitude 🙏🙏
No place😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
No te vayas Jurgen por favor, eres lo mejor que le pasó a Liverpool. Una champions mas te lo pido
Klopp YNWA ❤️ and i hope Klopp win the league too , best of luck 🙌
<3
Leave em while you're lookin good! Thank you for everything you've done in your tenure Jurgen, you are forever a legend.
He will manage the German National Team in 1-2 years. Trust me.
Liverpool without Klopp will no longer be interesting club for a fan (for me) 😢😢😢 it’s very sad 😔
😭😭 I am broken. The only person, who must be the next LFC manager, is Xabi Alonso
Thank you, Jurgen, for everything you have done. You will always forever be in the hearts of every liverpool fan.  ♥️
Jurgen come on how can you go without knocking out real Madrid in the champions league.... Love you so much our main man
I'm really distraught right now! But well...... nothing lasts forever!!
Honestly, I don't want to comment here. My heart's hurt, It is a Very Sad day. But as a human, I understand Klopp's decision.  Resign when You're HIGH, The Legacy will be remembered FOREVER. Thanks for EVERYTHING, Danke Jurgen Klopp. YNWA.
😢😢😢😢
Villa Fan here, but a MASSIVE Klopp Fan. The Premiership will MISS your energy. All the best in the future. YNWA / UTV 💪
When i saw this on Instagram i start  cry
Smart, honest, visionary decision   I hope you discover your happiness and another purpose, you’re amazing leader, Juergen
thank you boss for evreything .   "we are liverpool" .
My boss😭
Get alonso in
To all the players, win the blood league for this man 💪
Literally in tears , love you Jurgen ❤
Stevie G next then!
for sure a great servant of the club, city, and humanity… he gave his all so that everyone can benefit rather than use the club and its history for his personal glory… right up to the end he stresses that it is not about him… all the best… YNWA!!!
LEGEND 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 AVFC 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Gutted!! Wishing you the best boss!! YNWA!
Thank you for everything you have done for us boss. ❤
Thank you Jurgen for everything. What you did will be remembered by all of us fans for the rest of our lives. Where you took this club helped me when I was at my worst. I'll be always grateful for everything you gave with your heart and soul.
YNWA boss ❤
The best manager in the world
Wake up and this is the news I wake up to feels like I lost a family member😅 wow
At least he’s getting us used to Thursday night football again before he goes
I'm not crying.. I've just got something my eye. Thanks for everything boss, YNWA
What a spectacular manager he is, I feel so sad to hear this news from his own mouth.He is one of the greatest manager we have had ever  witnessed in the football history. It doesn't matter wherever he goes but the affection and beautiful memories will be last forever and we won't forget you🙏🙏🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵Mr. Klopp, glory💜💜
What Jurgen has achieved at Liverpool has my full respect and will to me always be greater than what Pep will ever achieve at Man city
It's a shock surely but how will It be when Pep announce he is leaving out🤷
Very bad news 😢.
Danke Klopp. Hope Xabi Alonso win the Bundesliga title this season and return to Anfield.
hey come to Barca ❤💙
As a United supporter I can't deny I'm going to miss him terribly. Taking bias out, it's great to see a team that isn't buying the league, has stayed community driven and has never put any single person before the club. I remember shaking hands with a supported when you all won the the Champions League, as much it hurts to see your rivals do so well, you can't help but respect the game they plays. Best of luck Jurgen.
Come to Ajax, we need you Klopp!
I'm ManU supporter and the last 30 seconds of that interview gave me a tear....If I was a Liverpool player I would run through 10 brick walls to make sure they send this man off with another Premier League Championship 🏆
Thank you❤
I'm devastated, iv supported liverpool for 32 years and he is the greatest manager iv ever seen at our club 😢 💔 I feel like crying
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🇬🇲
YNWA!!!
We will miss you coach
Best manager Liverpool have ever seen in recent times. What a man, a legend!
Long Live the Klopp
Bye
Best wishes!
It's a day we knew it would happen one day thanks Jurgen for all the memories and wish you and your family you are always in our heart ynwa mark ❤
Hes sick and tired of having his wheels nicked i heard
Up there with the great dynasty from Shankly to Dalglish. Surpassed Benitez by a long way. All good things must come to an end. 😢
Thank You Boss and Good Luck to You and Your Family  ⚽⚽⚽⚽
So sad with this news. Thank you for everything that you have been doing for this Football club. YNWA
Hahaha now premier League is gonna be city's league😂😂 but thank you klopp for the great games. You'll be missed.
❤🙏✌️
Why 😢😢😢
I think because of WW3 approaching, klopp wants to spend more with family and stay in his hometown.
make a statue and a movie for Jurgen Klopp at the end of the season 😢😢😢😢
The man who made me fall in love with football
YNWA Jurgen😭 We will always remember you❤
The best ones aren't motivated by money. They're driven by ambition. Jurgen's decision has to be respected. The man's a high-performer and high-performers are always hard on themselves. He recognizes that he can't keep giving 100%, and nothing less will do. All the best, Klopp. You're one of the best managers of this era.
😢shocked 😲 OMG
So strange that someone started chopping onions right when this video started. So so strange...
Speaking as a Man Utd fan, the premiere league will be the poorer without you, you were/are a breath of fresh air and moved the bar a little higher,good luck with all you do Jurgen
Heartbroken!!!!
If I were to speak from my heart I don't wanna win the league but I want klopp to stay.
That was actually heartbreaking. Cmon reds let’s give this man some more good memories before he goes ❤
I'm devastated shocked that was out of the blue
Omg this is close to a death in the family , I feel like I am losing a family member I am crying as I type this
I can't even
obviously, it's a deep fake video.. it's can't be true nice try
I hope LFC doesn't take the L here .
Amazing... Thank you my friend. For the first time, I saw Jurgen behind the manager. The man behind the role. He's nothing more than one of us, with our own every day worries. The point that I loved more was that "I am a normal man but I don't have a normal life". Yes, I can see that clearly. He is at 56 and he wants to rest. To have his Sunday with his family and not at the field. Successful as he is, he is still a man, like all of us. That's what I like most about him, not pretending to see a super-hero. Thank you Jurgen. We will keep this speech, as we will keep the fact that you gave us maybe the "sexiest" football team ever. You made us LFC fans.
Please come to united your a hell of a manager 🙏
Even as a City fan, hv big Respect for this Legend of Manager who gave neck n neck fight with Pep This will fire up the players to win major this szn
The players need to go and win everything for him now. An all time great Liverpool FC manager but he should have left it until the end of the season to tell us unless he feels it will kick on the team. Its a risk.
LOVE YOU, ALWAYS WILL LOVE YOU,  THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. YNWA.
This is so heartbreaking to hear. This is how you will find grown men cry, because i just did. 😢
I wasn’t ready… but how can I not understand after this man gave me my first Premier League and Champion League. Thank You Juergen I’m so happy your a Red
It’s a demanding and consuming job
Absolute legend. Thank you for everything.
Mid table arhh we will never sign another world class manager who els is there?
I will never forget his achievements. Jürgen YNWA❤
I am so sad 😢😢😢
This is shocking omg but no matter i knw this season will be d best 1 ever..klopp ynwa n thanks for all n i pray God keep on blessing you..
YNWA ❤
There is exactly ONE Single thing you have to know, when you look at his career: he is the only manager I remember that left three clubs and no matter where, people of the cities and fans of all three clubs where upset and even fans of other teams felt with him AND the clubs they don't even support usually.   And this is what makes him so special.  God luck to him, wherever he might end up.  I hope at my team again. 🖤💛🖤💛
United!?
Thank you Klopp ❤
10:21  it’s understandable as much as he loves Liverpool & the job but once someone has that kind of feeling I doubt there’s much anyone can do to change it
Thanks for posting.
hopefully his team will gift him a finale he deserves, with at least one major championship! what a run mr.klopp !
HEAR WE GO, Graham potter will take over as Liverpool manager from June 2024 on a 3 years contact
He will truly never walk allone. ❤ 2015-2023🥺
❤❤❤ YNWA KLOPP WE LOVE YA ALWAYS HAVE OUR HEARTS ❤️❤️❤️
Dis is me as a Liverpool fan 💔 cause we can never see a better coach than Jurgen klopp
The manager has spoken so let's support the team and follow his instruction.... YNWA
Thank you gaffer go enjoy the rest of your life with you wonderful wife your job is now done and by god you did it fabulously well
😭😭
You made me dream. The perfect manager. Forever a perfect match. What a sad day for the club. Never knew how much i could love a manager until Klopp came around.
From a Spurs fan he will be missed. We are only rivals in football.  Alles gut fuer die Zukunft Jürgen. All the best for the future Jürgen.
We’ll miss you jurgen ❤
I'm not even a Liverpool fan and I find this upsetting. I respect his decision totally but for me he's been a rare staple of the Premier League of the last decade along with Pep since pretty much every other club has been a revolving doorway for managers every other season.
God bless you Klopp ❤
The best farewell gift for him will be to win every trophy for him.
They will bring in Alonso
This is truly terrible and tragic news for LFC and us fans. A number of managers had been in and done after Evans but with sad feelings. Some we prefer they left LFC, but JK is legend and always be loved like Shankly, Bob and Evans. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
10.000 COMMENTS IN A BIT MORE THE 3 HOURS........EINCREDIBLE.......INSANE...
A very sad day
this man is a class act. much respect!!
Thank you klopp😢
Thanks for all Jürgen! YNWA
Merci pour tout Coach.
The most saddes day in history of football . Once a Red always a Red , Thanks Klopp always you will be with us
Der beste Lehrer den ich jemals hatte verlässt den besten Club der Welt. Es fühlt sich an, als wäre ein Familienmitglied gegangen. Danke für diese verdammt geilen 9 Jahre und alles gute für dich in der Zukunft. Durch dich wurde ich zum Liverpool Fan und werde es immer bleiben. YNWA <3
.... Thank you Klopp.. you did a a phenomenal job!!! YNWA
he is the people champion of managers. I love not just what he's achieved for us but also who he is as a person and what a role model for integrity, passion and care for your fellow person he is. Best manager in my time as a football fan.
Nooooooooo 💔
Thank you for everything , Good luck with u decision My Boss, I hope everyone understand with you reason and alway love u.
I’m shocked 😮 You are building LFC 2.0. I understood your reasons, but I’ll really, really miss you ❤️ I can’t imagine another person as a LFC manager. I remember other managers but it was never with your passion for the players, club and community. This is crucial moment for the players, they must have extra motivation to win the title for you Jurgen. I’m praying for it ❤
No 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
im actually in shock. YNWA
Thank you for everything,  and best wishes to you wherever your path may lead ❤
I love Klopp❤ 長い間お疲れ様でした。 貴方のおかげでリヴァプールが大好きになりました！
Legend ❤ YNWA.
JK is I think, quite a rarity in football. A man, liked by opposition fans and liked by people who wouldn't call themselves football fans at all. A good coach, a good manager and a good person.  Dare I say, I'm a Norwich fan of 50 years. My first away game was at Anfield. A car crashed into our coach en route, and we arrived in the stadium just in time to see Liverpool (Craig Johnston I think) score the first goal in an FA Cup 3rd round 5-1 walloping 🤦‍♂😁  I can only hope that following this interview, then a press conference, JK and the team minds are elsewhere for the next FA Cup meeting! Somehow I doubt that'll be the case 😁  Good luck to Jürgen, in all he does in the future, and good luck to Liverpool FC, in finding someone suitable to take over the mantel 👍
A real manager, a real legend!  Thank you ! Great years with us !
Uma lenda!
Money money money
ใจสลายครับ
That was a hard watch 😢
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
as an Arsenal fan, I can tell you first hand, that legendary managers are not defined just by their results, but also by great charisma and personality......   this guy will certainly go down as one of the goats of PL era......    even I will probably miss his presence in PL, because the amount of great characters like this one, is what makes PL so special......     wish him all the luck in his next journey, but one downside of this announcement is, that this might affect mindset of most players in the dressing room.....   and if WE won't be up for the task(which is most likely), then this can cost LFC the title by the end of the season......    and as an Arsenal fan, I am surely rooting for Liverpool to win it over City......     Klopp needs to make sure, that players adopt the opposite mindset of "we're winning this one for Jurgen"......    I'm hoping so, cause City will be relentless in the upcoming months
I am convinced this is an AI video pls tell me it’s not true man.😢
I'm crying you out.
It's a sad news for me to hear Klopp leaving Liverpool end of the year. Who can replace him next season?????
It's gonna be again tough being a Liverpool supporter, we'll still be here but Jurgen will be missed and not just as memory but the man, the aura, let's just hope the owners of the club choose the right people after this because if Pep Lljinders leave too then we are even fucked
kloppo is an outstandig human.
farewell Jurgen.. wish you all the best! thank you!!
Even thow im gutted the man did what he said he was going to do when he came to the club. Wish him nothing but the best will allways be a legend for liverpool fan,s YNWA 👏👏
I'm gutted.. thanks for all the beautiful memories Jurgen! 😭😭
🇹🇭🤲
Thanks for everthing.we love you where ever you.  God bless you  you must also love urself  not fgetting to make more time with ur fam especially  ur wife. Wife also much appreciated
คุณจะอยู่ในความทรงจำของผมไปอีกนาน ผมตั้งชื่อลูกชายว่า jurgen
Most managers get sacked, sad to see him go, but great he gets to go out on his own terms. Love you Jurgen!!!! YNWA ✌️✌️✌️✌️
I'm fucking crying. This guy is as important to Liverpool as Paisley and Shankley were. He is not just a coach.... he is a personality. A coach that will be remembered for decades. Thank you for everything Jurgen <3 Watching your teams since 2012 has been a blessing. Love you and let's get that quadruple to end your career on a high note!
This is the cumulative outcome and consequence of Liverpool's High Octane game style under Klopp but he has set a new standard for us; let's hope his replacement gets the support they will need to sustain this style of football.  What an amazing man!
From doubters to believers...the man deserves a statue outside Anfield, Jurgen Norbert Klopp thank you Boss... You’ll Never Walk Alone
See you in jedda
This is the saddest news I’ve heard this morning
Win the league, finish the story with that.
Am shocked not crying in my fair point he is one of the best coach at Liverpool he is the legend we will thank him for being a red Jürgen said to me you know Jürgen we will the league we know he said so I’m in love with him & i feel fine am so glad that Jürgen is a red am so glad he delivered what he said xabi Alonso will be his replacement true news he is the favourite for this job
His career is impossible he said pep would beg to differ
Kloppp !!!!
Felling Sad😪. I wish you the best.
It's a sad day for Liverpool FC, the team and its supporters 😭😭😭
It's time to build the statue.....
Sedih dengarnya, semoga sukses selalu abah klopp ❤❤❤❤
We Are Liverpool!!!
He is going Barcelona.
As a blue, its a shame Klopp leaving. I hope his health is OK..💙
Best wishes klopp you are great model for all of us
Good luck 🍀 you are going to be greatly missed 😢❤
Thanks for everything!
One of the greatest Liverpool managers ever ❤. It won’t be the same without him but this man has nothing but my respect and I hope the fans respect his wishes to not make this about him and keep supporting the team.
You never walk alone master .... you are Liverpool, we are Liverpool.... sometimes its not good to overstay , leave in a great moment.  ...
لانريد رحيلك عن الريدز
Legend❤️
As a city fan, I'm sad to see you go. Respect to you and all you did for that club. We will miss your fighting spirit.
Welcome to Saudi League
My heart is in my mouth. I knew eventually this day will come but I never wanted to face it. Thank you Klopp. For everything you have done for this club. You will forever be my greatest manager ever. *WE HAVE TO WIN THIS LEAGUE NOW.*  YNWA.
A man that can give young players the courage to face opponents of great stance, and they perform as if they are giants of football, is to be admired!
Jurgen Klopp.. Welcome to Manchester United!
What can I say? I’m devastated, yet wish you the best gaffer. YNWA. 🙏🏾
My weekend has just been crushed
Boss Klopp you are absolutely Legend and we love you as our family member, thank you very much for everything you’ve done for Liverpool YNWA🚩
Waking up to news like this is a sure fire way to ruin the day.
He closed many doors by saying he can't coach another team in the PL. And he know he doesn't mind.
Jürgen, thanks for your time in club, for your job, for trophies, you are ideally coach for me and other Liverpool's fans, thank you very much! ❤❤❤
Came for the Normal One.  Stayed for the Extraordinary One ❤
You will always be indelible in our hearts. The 8 years we spent with you were wonderful and full of influence. Thank you for your services to Liverpool. I am saddened to hear that you are leaving. I would like to see you back in Liverpool. Jurgun Klopp is a Liverpool fan from Uzbekistan😢😢😢😢😢
Thanks for everything jurgen, I wish this didn’t have to end, but alas, YNWA Jurgen, Thank you for bringing this team back to winning ways
Let us hope he does not go to saudi.
I wasn't ready for this...
Danke Jurgen, let’s make this last months hell for the rest of football ⚽️ YNWA
I understand the decision of klopp, it burnt my heart and no one will replace him. no one. i wish him luck in his new club
He should take a season off. Give pep the job until he feels like coming back. YNWA.
As a ctid fan we broke him ha
just wow speechless that he's leaving thank you jurgen
It seems as he is sick of battling against the ownership for money and the players he wants. He is constantly having to work miracles and he certainly has done that
Brings me back to Feb ‘91 ,it’s awful
I will miss you  You are the best
I'm heartbroken
YNWA❤ Thanks for everything we’ll miss you!!!😢
I mean Klopp is Liverpool and Liverpool is Klopp. 👑  I wish he goes to FC Barcelona. Mes Qué Un Club ❤️🖤
Klop yu are the best maneger how i look in liverpool fc and yu are the fest best maneger and the last best manager in liverpool no body can do that .in 5 years 4 cup wow
Am a man Utd fan but a big lover of Jurgen klopp and surely am already missing him n premier league will miss a general in klopp
im citizen but you are best of my heart. If you leave liverfool, bur you are not alone. YNWA
As a fan from the States, I am so grateful for Jűrgen and everything he has done for Liverpool. Absolute class act. YNWA 🫡
:(
That is how it felt when he left our Borussia...dear LFC Fans, I feel you ...
Future Bayern manager now that Tuchel is getting found out?
🎶Goodbye my friend (I know you’re gone, you said you’re gone but I can still feel you here)….🎶
Wow didnt see that coming but what a gent honest and open interview . The job is a pressure cooker and he needs a break .. we will always be grateful for what you have done for this club and city YNWA❤❤
Thank you Jürgen 👍
I'm really concerned about his mental health, he even mentions "sometimes you get ill and that's it".   BEST OF LUCK, as a UNITED fan, your a LEGEND
Today, a part of me is broken! You will be sorely missed Jürgen. Thank you for all you have done for Liverpool football club! You made me dream again and I’ll be forever grateful for everything u have done for our club!
One of our greats.  I'm devastated.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
It is unfortunate, but life must continue. I hope that the new manager will bring positive changes to Liverpool.
From a United fan,not only is Klopp a top manager,he is also a top bloke.
HAHAHHAHAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHHA JURGEN FLOP
Please do something for him to stay
He must be ill. The key here is that he well now meaning he might not be well in the future! Amazing manager and will be missed by football fans.
Its time for klopp for germany national Team. And i think nagelsmann will be our new Coach
This man reinvented liverpool.  Gutted the boss is going! Statue pending!
Noooo.....💔
Really sad
He's done an amazing job, he will be missed and will always be a Liverpool legend
its going to be sad for the whole PL that klopp is leaving , from a utd fan. You cant hate passion good luck mr klopp
It can't be put into words what this man has done for this club. Completely revolutionized the mentality, brought joy to a new generation of Liverpool fans, completely redefined modern football, created one of the best sporting rivalries of the last decade, and more importantly really lived the spirit of YNWA. Goodspeed Jurgen, nothing but the best, forever a red ❤
I still hope Anfield and Liverpool convince him by the end of the season not to leave. Do it Anfield please 🙏🏼
Wow! Whatever has a beginning, has an end, as they say. Your reign as Liverpool Manager is the most memorable in my entire time as a fan of this great club. God bless you. We have to celebrate you with a very successful season. We are in course for something unique. God willing, we will achieve this and immortalise your name forever. I wsh you well. Let's go for quadruple. We are Liverpool, We'll never walk alone.
All we can say is Thank you very much Boss... U surely did turn us from doubters to believers❤️
This is Epic Interview ever watched in my  life without scripts🎉🎉 Started watching at 500k views before the end of my watching the views are already at 2m.
As a Man Utd fan I have nothing but the upmost respect for what Jurgen has achieved at Liverpool.  He's been a superb manager for your club. He took them to the summit again domestically and in Europe.  I wish him all the best for what he's does next. He will be a very tough act to follow. But he has laid very strong foundations regarding the team for the next manager. He's the only manager in recent times that has gone toe to toe with Man City. It would never happen, but, I would have him at Old Trafford in a heartbeat. I hope the fans enjoy the rest of season with him. He could very well sign off as a history maker.

Welcome to Manchester united 😂😅❤
Thanks Jurgen - my all time fav manager. You are also a wonderful human being !!! Best of luck for the future whatever you chose to do.
Ynwa Jürgen the best manager I've seen in my life time
Buy him some damn Red Bull. DOn't leave
Please god let Alonso take over
God damn it! I knew this season was going too well. Something had to go wrong!!!
Well this fucking sucks
💔
Thanks Jurgen for everything you have done for the club. I wish you weren't leaving and i'm gutted you are but end of the day I wish you well!
We will see you in the arsenal dug out next year fella ! We look forward to it
It's because he isn't being allowed to conduct January signing, which is important for the rebuild
Herzlichen wünsche Jürgen. Pep Lijnders for manager.
Hahaha good
Jurgen means more to me than most, while we were on the way to winning the title under him i was in hospital constantly being tested and trying different treatments took its toll on me, but the thought of watching us winning the title got me through the worst of it. THANK YOU JURGEN YNWA
Love this man ❤
Jurgen t was liverpool . Liverpool t was jurgen
We will never let you walk alone, Klopp 🙏💔 Goodbye, the best coach I have ever seen
Kloop pls don't leave
Oh my world
Человечише 😢
I love this club and the coach too , i am really sad of leaving him and his stuff , the works will remaind us ever what he did for the club . Hey liverpool fans never worry we are still the best in England ❤
😢❤
I'm in a shocked to hear that his leaving the club,,, as a Liverpool supporter thank you so much for  what you have done to LFC..you are the best  manager in the world..from Australia 💔😢
Some heroes retire. ❤  You gave us stories to tell our children. YNWA
I will tell my kids there was a man who was a manager of Liverpool fc stolen all the love of football fans❤.we are gonna miss you Jurgen Love you, thanks for all the wonderful moments ❤.
*Gooner here. I've always liked what he did with Liverpool, he's done wonders.*
Your never walk alone. Thanks for all 🎉
Mate, I'm absolutely devastated. I wish him all the best with anything in his future, wonderful manager, man, father, role model and so much more. Let's send him off properly and take the lot! YNWA
I hope Liverpool hire Roberto De zerbi as next liverpool coach he reminds me of klopp a bit and maybe he can build kn what Klopp left
Tottenham boke klopp 😂😂
Even as a Man United supporter this is upsetting. Klopps Liverpool is one of the best in Europe and he's a top manager. Enjoy the retirement mate and wish you nothing but the best health 💯
Respect for Jurgen coming from Chelsea fan. He’s a great coach and a man with class.
Xabi Alonso in next......
❤
You will never walk alone. Good bye Klopp❤❤😢😢
This is so heart breaking... But it's all about living for once. That's very important. I will miss you personally
At the beginning, I thought this was another fake video created by AI. After searching through a few channels, it's genuine!  Sad to hear he broke the news. He is one of the few amazing club managers for a long time. I have the concern that LFC may not find another JK after him.  On a side note, I feel he deserves a knighthood bestowed by the King!
Nooooooooooooooooooooooø
I would run through a brick wall and swim through broken glass for this man. We love you Juergen and you will forever be a Liverpool legend
Thank You Boss…. ❤❤  YNWA!!!
Thank you Jurgen YNWA 🔥👏👏👏
Why??????? The effort and dedication that the boss has made for this team. The team we've been cheering for for over 30 years. Boss must win more championships. What else is there about 2.0? Another new player who moved in: DOM8 Mecca10 ENDO6 Ryan38, he moved because he wanted to work with the boss. Where is the matter of renewing the contract with Virgil4 M.salah10 trent66 or even Alison1? He wanted to renew the contract because of the boss. Because they know Even the football fans know. That the boss's efforts over the years must have been more than this  So why do the team executives allow time for the boss to feel like this? The boss has made the team this size. Whatever the boss wants or wants, make the boss. Football fans want Klopp Continuing the team for a long time, continuing the team to win more championships. Please, the team executives open up to Boss about what needs to be done in order for Boss to stay with us. It's something that I really can't accept.😢😢😢
HE TOLD ME NEXT JOB NAPOLI SERIA A
Barca fan, but I supported Liverpool in the premier league all because of Klopp.
MO Salah will be leaving end of season
Absolutely heartbroken.  I was wishing it was a clickbait headline when I saw it, but then I saw that it was from Liverpool FC's Youtube channel, and then listening to him say those words and try to explain his decision absolutely shattered me.   We will forever love you Jurgen. YNWA!
thank you sir klopp i hope you get good healthy & your family too and success in your decision from me indonesia fan liverpool
This feels like a dream, that i wish to wake up from. I’m egyptian and klopp made me adore this club, since 2017 i never missed a game. all i can say is with all due respect, Hats off to you mr. jurgen, you did the unthinkable❤️
As a Man City fan Jurgen has all my respect he did everything for Liverpool, winning them League tital , winning the UCL and wonderful clash at home and away, Klopp thank you for everything the PL thanks you❤
Please Please Please… I hope it is not due to any health reasons as he has said. I wish you all the very best Mr. Klopp. A top manager forever. We will miss you in the premier league and hope to come up against you in the champions league in the near future. Utd fan 🙌🏿
Let's go now, one more time!!!!
no fuckin way dude😢😢😢😢
"its not about me" amazing leadership reminder from Klopp
I will need to see a statue at the end of the season!
Please don't Jurgen. We are not ready to face this moment. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
He sounds as if he has an illness that he doesn't want to disclose
Why so sudden?and the biggest shock is why also pep,peter and vitor they're also going sure there is something wrong?
Thank you Klopp, for all the good times you’ve given us over these years. You really aided and helped the club in it’s hard times and given us the chance for good times.
Hahahahaha 😂😂😂😂 yesssssssssss. Get gone mate!
Pep broke Klop
😢Thank you for the memories  everything about the way you made the team to play football  was unbelievably good and very entertaining . The dressing room energy was pure class from you.Everyone was family and still think they are family. You gave us some superstar worldclass players its understandable  you want to try having  a life you never tried thats the same thing l try to achieve l wouldn't  want any regrets when am unable to stand up straight or even walk on my own. PS Klopp pliz give us names on who can be your successor. Am sorry  if this  is not the time
Difference between Klopp and Mikel Arteta is that he said he goes for everything meaning all cups rather than eggs in one basket!
😭😭😭This Is soooo sad but I wanna thank you for everything Mr Jurgen Klopp you are the greatest manager in football. ❤❤❤Although We dont want you to leave we all hope you Enjoy Your Break, You deserve It.
Please go to Barcelona 🙂🙂
Ficaaaaaa. ❤❤❤😢
So sad to hear of Klopp’s decision but I respect Klopp’s decision YNWA.
He’s a living legend of a man. Immense presence in the modern game and the PL. What an amazing gesture and said with such raw honesty. Love the man and all he stands for.   Now go get Alonso!   YNWA and in Klopp we trust ❤️
These comments are pathetic, it's a bloody game hhaahaha
Liverpool without Klopp is a different Liverpool. Not the same anymore
This is a devastating news, but happy for Klopp. Thank you Jurgen for all the joy you have given LFC. Alhamdulillah. Allah is the best of planners. YNWA
😢
I feel for you guys. He´s a special one even if he says otherwise. Still miss him. Greetings from Dortmund. YNWA!
I love the man so much
We'll miss you bos 😢😢😢
Brilliant open, honest and vulnerable interview from one of the best in the business.

One of the greatest coach ever! ❤️
Descansa um ano e vem pro corinthians
Now Jürgen Klopp has no choice but to train the German national team and make us world champions in 2026. 😁
Fully understandable decision. All the best Jurgen
Sorry im a man but i couldn't hold my tears 😢😢

Klopp sounds like a player I signed  in 2021 in the winter season. My star player for 3 seasons straight woke up saying the same stuff his been turnt, trust me. I've heard this before last week, and today I love you klopp ❤do you dude!!!!2024 hasn't been kind to me
No have words for this man only Legend. Thank you for everything when you talk about Daire gorman make me cry. You are the man Mr.Jurgen Klopp I love you.❤😢

But before you leave please win us the Europa league&Premier league.
As a Liverpool Fan since 2003, I have seen all the bad times and good times. Thank you Klopp. You were, are, and will be GOAT manager.
We'll miss you bos 😢
Klopp ❤
I am heartbroken 💔 . I mean i  never imagined this.just cant process it atm tbh. Feel really empty inside.

Great Man! Great History of Liverpool! Take your time and comeback if you will want to do!!!

Pep Guardiola is next.
Tiene derecho a descansar, tiene familia, hijos, nietos, quizás, de los que no puede disfrutar por su trabajo, está bien, que se retire, y en uso de sus logros, no derrotado, Felicidades Sr.🩵🇺🇾🩵🇺🇾🩵🇺🇾🩵🇺🇾
💔💔💔
I didn't expect a moment like this would happen 🥲
Thank you Jurgen. My allergies are playing up.
He said he will never manage a team in the premiership what about MILLWALL Mr Klopp
I remember the day when Jurgen was invited by Arsense to see the club when he already left BVB I was hoping he will take over his legacy and take it to next level. Never the less he made decision to take over struggeling Liverpool, and brought it back to the level everyone was expecting. Right to the top.This is indeed a fairy story and I wish him all the best in his future endavours. Living bit of normal life can be often trickly in the times that don't allow it much. As for now business as usual and I hope we will give you good title push.
Pep has broken him😢
You 're my superhero ❤😢
Not a Liverpool fans but no doubt Klopp will go down as the best manager in the prem if not ever
Incredibly strong ❤️
I'm crying. Ynwa 😢don't leave us 😢
Really hope...Liverpool not to be Manchester...
Honestly guys, I feel all of you Liverpool supporters. Its like a perfect fit will come to an end and all the time you will ask yourself "was it really necessary that it ended?" - you will feel something is missing for years to come. Everyone else who sits in his chair, tries to walk in his shoes, you will always know how klopp reacted in some situations, how klopp decided to do things.  Sad to say, but you will always gonna miss him, no one will ever be like him, no matter how hard the people in the club will try to prove otherwise, klopp is just a special person, as the "normal one" and you will never be able to replace him.  I hope everyone of you will enjoy the remaining months with Klopp, please soak it up like a sponge and keep all the beautiful moments deep in your heart.  Sad greetings from a Dortmund supporter
😭
I 🙏 that Real Madrid win la Liga and the Champions league, there is only one replacement for the Boss. 🤞 Thanks Jurgen.
Thanks Mr. Klopp for bringing the glory days back to Liverpool.  We had our ups and downs but you brought a real sense of excitement and a belief in achieving anything.   Good Luck!
Wow sad & Happy Arsenal Fan from Ethiopia, its bad time competing with you. Before you go we would give u some goodbye kick in a few days. Thank god this Amazing guy is over. ❤
Devastated is an understatement. We love you Mr Klopp, thank you for this incredible ride we’ve been on together. I hope the boys win some silverware for the send off. YNWA ❤
내가 축구와 야구를 좋아하지만 다시 태어난다면 둘 다 안보는 삶을 살고싶다 이것들은 가끔 나에게 낭만을 선물하지만 가끔은 나에게 슬픔을 안겨준다
Gotta rename “The Kop end” to the “The Klopp End” right? It’s similar to the name now but pays respect to this man.
I'm just utterly gutted.. 💔 It has been a blast. Legendary. Shall always have a place in our hearts. Wish him all the best in all his future endeavours. Jurgen Norbert Klopp, YNWA!
Jurgen has made a wise decision. He could see himself burning out and that carries all kinds of bad outcomes, both physical and mental. Sometimes the hardest decision is the one to walk away. Jurgen has made both a wise choice, and a correct one. Also by saying this now, he has done the honourable thing by his club, his players and the supporters. With this burden off his shoulders he can now manage Liverpool to the best of his ability, which is considerable, to say the least. It is easy to forget that the job of manager of an elite EPL team is a VERY TOUGH GIG. Add in the tradition and expectations that surround LFC, then you can double that pressure. I am sure that no one wants to see Jurgen collapse on the pitch and wind up in ICU at Liverpool Hospital. Or worse.  The constant intense pressure of todays elite sporting world is a multiple of what past managers had to deal with. You are not going to see a long term manager like a; Bill Shankly, Don Revie, Matt Busby or Brian Clough these days. The last of the "marathon men' was  Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. He lasted 17 years! Incredible. Jurgen's next chapter is just beginning.
The last time I was broken hearted was when El Nino left us for Chealshit, never felt like that again.....until today. Oh it hurts so bad! 💔😢
we knew it had to happen, but WHY now in my lifetime? Love Liverpool
😢
You will b sadly missed thanks for your commitment to the club you will always b Liverpool  thank you. One love 😂
now city gonna dominate the league next season, i really hope xabi come to this team
Devistated is an understatement we love you kloop YNWA
GREAT PERSON ,Huge respect !!!
I honestly can't describe my feelings at this moment. I feel empty from within by the very thought that jurgen won't be our gaffer from next season. It's just so heartbreaking. But at the same time having heard his reasons for this decision I can have nothing but more respect & adulation for him. If he thinks it's in the best interest of Liverpool football club for him to step down, then it sure is. Of everything he's done & said over the years as the gaffer, one thing comes to my mind, "it's not important how we feel when the manager comes in, but how we feel when he leaves". How right was he! The grief, the sadness, the desire to hold on to someone & not let them leave & so many feelings I'm experiencing now, I've never had in my life. I wonder how liverpudlians would've felt when shankly decided to step down. Jurgen was & will always be more than just a football manager for LFC. He is family for every liverpool supporter around the 🌎. He might not be our gaffer from next season but he'll forever be a part of the Liverpool family, a red & he'll forever be our "normal one". I love  jurgen more than words can describe & would give everything for having him at anfield longer; but i respect his choice & wish him & ulla the best in future. Jurgen klopp YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE.
Jürgen you are everything that Liverpool represents. We love you and wish you the best. Thank you for giving us moments we will always cherish and remember.   YNWA❤
Should’ve won more leagues
Thank you, Jurgen
You have to leave when you are still loved
Very sad day. I understand his reasoning full heartedly though. Hes been managing for so long now and hasn’t really had the chance for that normal life he wants to try. I feel like he will regret leaving, however I think if he forced himself to stay he might would have other regrets about waiting too long to retire.
This smacks of a bloke totally loyal to Liverpool who really wants to win with Liverpool but deep down knows he can't do it anymore with the owners.  But who knows there is a team waiting for him with a massive transfer budget.
its not just end of an era for liverpool but for premier league, im pretty sure pep will find himself somewhere else after klopp leave... klopp is the reason pep tryhard at city that many years
In 2014 I went to the Dortmund friendly at Anfield, Klopp greeted the crowd at the end of the game dispute us beating them 4-0. He just oozed class and charisma as I said to my friend leaving the game afterwards he was made to manage LFC.   My heat is broke on hearing this news but the club will move he has set us up for years to come .. YNWA Juergen thank you for the best footballing years of my life 💔❤️❤️
All eras must come to an end 👹
Fc Bayern 2025
Won't ever be the same but if anyone deserves a break...
I accept your decision Jurgen, thank you for everything. The only thing im skeptical about is why is ALL THE COACHING STAFF leaving as well?
Perfect timing to bring Xabi Alonso from Germany
💔😞
That last message left me with a genuine lump in my throat... I loved this man from the first press conference, and I love him even more now. Jurgen YNWA
😢😢😢
This man never gets sacked
Huaahhh anyinggg☹️
2015-2024....Watta ride it has been 😢 Farewell kloppo...hope we finish strong just for this man right here  The players should be fired up by now to absolutely give their best from now on
We will always adore and appreciate you for everything you've done, Jürgen!
The one and only ❤Kloop
oh nooo .... i hope we could survive at the top level without him 😢
Although Klopp will leave, his legacy remains with Liverpool and the fans forever. A true liverpool legend. God bless and good luck in the future Jurgen ❤🥂
I was 9 when he came now im 18 sad to see boss leaving us 😢
Terima kasih sudah membuat tin yg permainannya selalu mendebarkan dan indah ❤  Aku sering menonton pertandingan Liverpool padahal bukan fans nya 😅
Why 😢😢😢😢
I want to cry 😢
News bad😢 no plz
Thank you Boss. For everything. YNWA
Jurgen Klopp YNWA ❤
😳😭😭😭
As a City fan I’ll miss this guy, enjoyed the battles against Liverpool and the energy he brought all the time, the fact that no match was a given. EPL Legend in my books, wishing him all the best. Looking forward to the last Liverpool vs City game - Klopp vs Pep 09 March 2024 🏆
Klopp will leave with the knowlage he turned this club arround. He made more than a club. He made it a family. I hope whatever he will do from now on he will find his peace with it. Jürgen... You never walk alone!❤
Thank you Jurgen for being a fantastic manager at LFC!! You have given us plenty of awesome memories over the years!  You, your team and the players contributed greatly to the success of LFC.  YNWA !!
Got of a manager  He’s surely up there ❤
Lmao 🤣 all liverpool fans about to cry for decades yall are finished
I'm devastated and broken. But wait, Klopp has been so magnificent for us in the past years. The memories still lingers and unforgettable.   Jurgen I admire your personality,  the energy and the rivalries you brought to EPL, Liverpool. I'll definitely miss your fist pumps that often stir up the fans, I hope the next manager continues with fist pumps. How amazing has your time with Liverpool turned out to be. You're such a stunning figure to admire always.   Thank you.
Such an amazing manager and most importantly an amazing MAN. Really shocked its so soon☹️ Thank you for the memories YNWA ❤
Don’t get it.
A STATUE FOR JÜRGEN !!!!!!  MASSIVE!!!!! LFC ❤
A very very very sad news...I think Liverpool is the Klopp marriage club, they are equal...sad!
Thank you Jurgen 👏👍❤️❤️. I wish you all the best in your endeavors ❤❤❤. Love from Nigeria ❤️❤️
Thank you a lot, Jurgen Klopp! YNWA
Should have win at least 2 more league titles if he has the same spending amount as Pep
Please someone get me in Liverpool
So mf sad
Im stunned adn really sad, Lets go and win the prem, league cup and europa guys come one. so sad :(
😢😢teacher
Klopp will always be Liverpool🏆 🥹😰
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Klopp for PM
Who will be our next boss? Xabi Alonso?
Great Manager... Great Speech...We will always miss you for sure.
I love you sweet dad Jurgen Klopp
As heartbreaking as it is, we wish you achieve what you wish to achieve ❤🔴
Thank you legend YNWA ❤❤❤
No words can express my appreciation. Klopp, you are the best! Everything good to you! Take a long break then.
Hearing this news I am crying now.... Wherever Klopp will go I wish him success... His contributions to LFC will never be forgetten.... I wish he could have stayed at Liverpool for at least 5 more years.... But I have to respect the decision of Mr. Klopp.. Thank you Mr. Klopp.... YNWA.
He deserves a statue for his farewell
I am afraid now. After Fergie left united they were never the same, next Manager will have enormous weight on their shoulders
Jürgen Klopp has developed very well, i think now he is ready for a Massiv Club Like Real Madrid or Bayern München.
I'm going to miss you dad!
Jurgen Klopp ; Sweet father 🥲We love you Sweet Dad❤️🥲 When I heard that you were leaving the Liverpool team, I was shocked , you are like my father ,
ManU fan here. I would just like to say, it is with great regret that I have to inform you that your application to leave the prem at the end of the season has been rejected.  While we appreciate your honesty and candour in making the application along with the validity of the reasons given, we'd like to see the epl grow from strength to strength and your contribution to that end is undisputed.  We will, willingly at first and potentially begrudgingly later, put up with you until you reach ancestor status. We're kindly referring you to Mr Roy Hodgson to embark on a mentorship program to ensure your endurance over the coming decades. Thank you and we look forward to your continued presence in this league.
Jürgen Klopp has been the best!  He deserves a "normal life", a normal boring life can be wonderful.  Everyone needs a chance to drop out and slow down.
I will deffs miss this man
I am a fan of Chelsea football club, but I have great admiration and respect for Jurgen Klopp. I have enjoyed watching Liverpool play under his leadership because of his charisma and energy. I will miss him as he departs from the club. I wish him all the best and hope to see him back on the pitch soon.
This is so emotional for me We should respect his decision
Feels like I’ve lost a family member! So gutted! Thank you for  all the good times Jurgen! YNWA
"Forever guardian of the liverpool"  You'll never walk alone, boss........
😢
this will be undoubtedly a big loss for the liverpool community
I started following football in 2017   Jurgen, thank you for the amazing memories you gave us! Will never forget the jurgen klopp era at this club! I’m happy you’re moving on. Please don’t retire. Join a new club (in the big 5 leagues). Football needs you. We need you. I need you.  All the best!
You will always be our memory😢
Massive massive shock because he’s rebuilding another dynasty and i honestly thought he would want to see it flourish and become great,sad,sad day for me and obviously all reds,but listening to interview he’s obviously devastated and looks tired to me,but I’m also convinced everything is in place to see it all through and I bet he’s involved in picking he’s successor.MANY THANKS JURGEN,YNWA😢
Юргун, какой же ты крутой.  Спасибо тебе за то, что научил нас снова верить!!!
Pure pain. This man is family.
So, Alonso will come over from Leverkussen?
Build the man a statue ❤
He can stand next to Shankly Paisley and Dalglish, total respect
You deserve the rest after 37 years of nonstop action-   As a player 1987	1. FC Pforzheim		 1987–1988	Eintracht Frankfurt II		 1988–1989	Viktoria Sindlingen		 1989–1990	Rot-Weiss Frankfurt 1990–2001	Mainz 05  Managerial role 2001–2008	Mainz 05 2008–2015	Borussia Dortmund 2015–2024	Liverpool
THANK YOU KLOPP FOR EVERYTHING,WE LOVE YOU!!!♥
Started watching Liverpool basically because of him in early 2016, never stoppped since. Greatest manager of our time if you ask me, and Liverpool and he were just a match made in heaven, destined for greatness. Lets see what the rest of the season has in store for him and the team. Could be awesome. Thanks for the great time Kloppo.
Thx u Klopp
Liverpool FC is a unique football club in a million ways. One of those million ways is that the manager is almost always the most idolised and respected person at the club, ahead of any players. Shankly, Paisley, Dalglish, Benitez etc... and of course Kloppo! He will truly never walk alone
"You'll be missed" will never be a bigger understatement. From the U.S., thank you for all the amazing, amazing memories. Some still to come, I think! Kloppo, YNWA. 🙏
What a cool guy and what a gentlemanly way to make the announcement! Enjoy some time off with your family, thank you for the memories. You’ve been a joy to watch over the last years
Thank you for everything, Jurgen! YNWA
Getting out while he is on top, smart! Klopp is a legend and I hope he gets to guide the Reds to another league title this year.
Thank you Jürgen ❤YNWA
I think he is missing Germany
Klopp, YNWA ❤   If normal life gets a bit boring, please come back 🙏🏻  Legend 😢
We love you Jurgen, and you know that. We all new that this day one day will come. But still its hard to take in. It hurts so bad.
Je suis actuellement aux comores, je me sans vraiment fatiguer Jurgen Klop tu es le meilleur de nous, je vous en plie rester avec nous Liverpool c'est notre famille ❤❤❤❤❤❤
That's what real leadership looks like. Thank you, Jurgen, for everything!
Uniteds new manager 😮 😂
Klopp. Words fail. Your passion and love has been felt and I hope you can feel ours. You will always be in the heart of every Liverpool supporter. You are sure to be remembered as one of the true legends. Look after yourself. YWNA.
I love this man ❤
What a man. What honesty, what humility. I wish I could shake his hand one day.
Klopp in my eyes is a legend at this club. Will be sadly missed cannot imagine now not having him as the manger at the club but I think  its probably hard being a manager at club like Liverpool as there is so much expectation. I wish him well and what ever he does or where ever he goes next I wish him all the best for the future YNWA.
Will miss you this is only my opinion I believe he is sick and tired of the referees and the decisions he has had to put with there a videos you watch with the blatant decisions going against Liverpool and him having to fight against pgmol  if we are honest he must be fed up having to fight against the bias he has had to put up with well done web and var forcing a man whom has brought good football to the epl hope you and your like are happy now with your bias
Is he off to Barcelona?
Sad day for us. Surely pep linders takes over.
Ich heule.. klopp was the best manager that Liverpool could have.. we have a long season now. It's not a goodbye now. We will always love Klopp und he never walks alone❤
Thank you Jurgen K . We are liverpool family.Liverpool football style!! love it . YNWA
Hope you everytime happy and healthy with 100% respect and gratitute. Thank you very much boss. You will be always with us, wherever whenever.
he will lose the carabao cup ... its already fixed . sembean
최근 가장 리버풀댜운 감독이었는데.. 당신때문에 조금더 리버풀을 사랑하게 됬어요.. 이렇게 떠나니 너무 아쉽네요 YNWA❤
Klopps last game at Anfield and the ceremony is going to be so emotional. I love Klopp for what he's done for football and the fans, the connections he builds, the passion he gives. The loyalty he inspires, he's not just a legendary football manager. He's a wonderful human being. Thanks Klopp, from a hammer.
Datang pergi sebenernya biasa terjadi, tapi ini kok nyesek sampe ulu hati 😭😭
Thank you for all you've done! YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE!!!
💔💔💔💔
Now he will one day make Germany world champions. Still extremely sad for Liverpool. These two just fit together. It was a pleasure watching Liverpool play football
Its bussiness after all. He got payed well and he delivered. Has nothing to do with love. Nexxxxtttt !!!!
Thanks for everything Jürgen.  You came in and saved the club and transformed it. We owe you everything and are forever grateful. Thanks for all that you've done and for the memories over the years. I'm heartbroken to see you leave, but that's just my selfishness thinking. I love you.
Tega lo klopp 😭
클롭 감독님 수고하셨습니다  ㅜㅜ
Maybe Mourinho next for 3 seasons
It is always the best when you leave and everyone asks "Why?" And not "Why not?". Thanks for everything Mr Klopp.
Get the feeling this isn't the end of this story. Perhaps Klopp knew that the news was going to come out by a third party, so he got in there first. I will be surprised if he lasts until the end of the season tbh.
Let's win. Everything: -Carabao Cup -FA Cup -Europa League -Premier League -Golden Boot -Goal Assistant -Player of the Year -Clean Sheets -Goal of the Year  -Get everyone on best 11 team of the Year And of course... Manager of the Year!  ❤YNWA!!❤
Salah getting old & slower, then Klopp leaving Liverpool ... 😂 It's been a good 9 season of top class, now back to mediocrity, mate.
am shocking and stunning at the front of my computer around 1 hours
When you walk through the storm there’s a golden sky on the horizon  Thank you Jurgen the normal one YNWA ❤❤❤
So is he going to retire as a manager?
Devastated,  but fully understand  Jurgens reason for leaving. Thanks for the wonderful memories mate
This man made me believe if we really mean it we can do it. Nothing can or will replace you.
As a United fan i wanted to share my deepest condolences with all Liverpool fans at this time, I am truly sorry you will lose the best manager you ever had..............................only joking 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope you get some good rest. I don't doubt that you'll be the manager of Germany at some point.
My heart can't take it. two years too early JURGEN😢
I wish you all the love in the world what a character you will always be Liverpool. And that's coming from a Celtic fan. Respect 100% 👍🙏🙏😊
1 word LEGEND 😢
Thank you JK. YNWA, I support your decision and your message to us is on point, crytsal clear. Not about an individual but the whole liverpool fam, community. Your time came and you did magnificent, normal one. God bless you and your family. 🍻🍻 To Klopp!!
This is heartbreaking 💔💔💔.........Klopp will be greatly missed. Miss him already😭❤
Gänsehaut… was für ein Coach und was für ein Mensch… Einzigartig! Danke für alles Jürgen! 🙏
I’m crying. Thank you so much for everything Klopp❤
You will be missed Jurgen.... you are already a legend for LFC.  All the best.  To you and family
This is such a great loss for football, the end of an Era. Klopp is such a likable leader, he was often head to head with Pep, this man had done so many things for the club and for football in general. You will be sorely missed. Always a Liverpool at heart...
Lets finish this season with a bang for Klopp
sad day in my heart!!😥😥
Hope you have a great life after this, Sir.   Let's Zidane or Alonso continue
Hope you'll have a great life after this, Sir.   Let's Zidane or Alonso continue
We LOVE you man for EVER
So gutted,  shocked.....  No words can explain how I'm feeling.   Also shocked that the back room will leave to.   Its a massive hole to fill,  I'm very worried for the club.
He will and he can't go to another club in Europe! He needs people with heart  for his way to be himself and a manager. It was special in Mainz, it was special in Dortmund and it was special in Liverpool. Spain is so different and just a theatre and Bayern, no way, just touristic, England is done now, so.... maybe national manager or coming home to Mainz and doing nothing.
BURNOUT IS REAL. :(
Thank you Klopp, for all the good times you’ve given us over these years. You really aided and helped the club in it’s hard times and given us the chance for good times. Under you we even won the Champions League and the Premier League. Your legacy at Liverpool will never be forgotten. While I’m deeply saddened by the news of your departure, I know you’ll stay a scouser wherever you go. Thank you, for gracing us with your coaching. This interview has brought tears to my eyes, it was unexpected. But we all knew this day would come eventually. Once with Liverpool always with Liverpool. YNWA ❤ take care Klopp 👍
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 We need Julian Nagelsmann then…
Jurgen is a living football legend! Huge respect for him from a Manchester United fan!
My heart is broken knowing i will never get to see him live on the pitch. With that said, the greatest decision maker we have seen, made a decision and the chance of him making the right one, is demonstratively high.
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
Thank you , sir 😢
Absolute legend ❤
Jürgen Klopp has shown the world again he is a REAL MAN.............FACT......YNWA.
I was devastated hearing the news earlier today. After listening to this interview I completely understand him. If he feels he can't keep the energy up, then this is the best possible way for the club to prepare so they can keep the standards up, as much as it hurts. God Bless Jurgen Norbert Klopp! YNWA ❤️
انها حقا خسارة كبيره لعشاق الكرة العالميه وخصوصا جمهور ليفربول. من القلب نتمنى الخير لكلوب وشكرًا جزيلا
Nahiiiii
Captain Jurgen Norbert Klopp, You will never walk alone.
Goodbye title challenge
I just can't imagine a situation at Annfield without the boss himself. It's sad for we the fans.
With a very heavy heart, I accept your decision.  We are very blessed that you have helped all doubters be believers. Best manager in the world.  Thank you👍
A sad, sad day indeed
Very upset with this news but absolutely respect the decision totally, all his energy has been with Liverpool and it shows with how he has transformed this club and we have been blessed to have him here. Best manager on the planet and let's win everything to give him the best send off possible. ❤
Football will never be the same without him😢
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Oh no, no man
YNWA, thanks jurgen for transforming Liverpool. You have created special place in all Liverpool supporters ❤
we will miss you klobb best manager in the world
Jurgen IS Liverpool. Thank you for everything Jurgie, the family, the trophies, and the love ALL started by you. YOU started this new era and hopefully, the new coach we will continue your good work. God Bless you Jurgen
Best Coach in the world  stealing trophies out of you and us won't change that fact   You means a lot to us  you being well means a lot to us.. So ,  best of Luck  YNWA 💓
What more can he do.... Thank you for everything!
What a shame. End of an era.
Im in shock! We will miss him to death
Win this season for klopp
Lack of enough investment (new signings) seems the strong reason for this decision
Pep lijnders please take over. I can't believe it it's so shocking I'm kind of in shock.  This is not good for Liverpool going forward.  YNWA JÜRGEN
😢😢😢
Many coaches often miss the opportunity to step down in time while their star is still shining high in the sky.
Estoy cansado jefe 😢😢😢
Devastating news  What a legend of a man and manager  His legacy will live on forever  YNWA
This is one of the saddest days. Reminds me of when Dalglish quit. But I understand Klopp needs to take care of himself and his family too. Whatever, I will always thank him for everything he has done for us. A true RED. LET'S GO AND WIN ALL!!! WE ARE THE RED ARMY UNDER GENERAL KLOPP!!! YNWA!!!!!
Thank-you Jurgen for all we have achieved. Great human being & manager. God bless you in all your future endeavours.
Thanks for the memories klopp and success . It will never be matched . All the best YNWA
The year Bob left we won the league cup and Bob went up the Wembley steps to collect the trophy.  If we beat Chelsea in the final I wonder if Jurgen will collect the trophy ...
looooooooool
🥺 Every good thing comes to an end. So to elegant endings and beautiful beginnings 🥂 Let's Go Reds! ♥️ A trophy or two would be a fitting souvenir for the Gaffer 🏆
Jurgen i love you
What's going on? 😢
Gutting 😢
Only love and respect, danke Jurgen, you'll never walk alone ❤
Thanks Koop, he’s got plenty of money..he’ll be okay.
keep klopp or bring in xabi alonso as a replacement
What a great man!
All the best jurgen we've had a blast,
Apa iya ini saatnya😢
We love u Jugen ❤️❤️ u will be greatly missed but you’ll always be a red
Thank you boss
my friend woke me up at 7 am to tell me the news. I've supported Liverpool from the beginning of the Kloppo era and watched him transform this club, winning the UCL and EPL. Thank you, Klopp. YNWA ❤ P.S.: someone build this man a statue outside anfield, it's the least we can do
klopp his a legend to us all and whatever decision he makes we should understand but it is really sad that we will lose him YNWA 🔥🔥🔥
Obrigado Klopp! Nós te amamos!❤❤❤ YNWA 🇧🇷
I hope this is the greatest bluff in football history, like when Ronaldinho told everyone he was leaving Barca but didn't. Today is a sad one
I will never forget you Klopp, thank you so much for everything you did for us ❤
Love You Klopp❤❤❤
This is worse than Kenny leaving it's heartbreaking. He's given us everything my favourite manager of all time 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
Now matter how many times I watch it I'm holding back the tears 😢😢😢 we will respect your decision but hurts like hell😢😢😢
i don't know what to say i'm really crying. are we now heading to the petrol station for refilling new era. Nah nah i can't believe
What a run ! Let´s finish it on a high ! Whatever happens next we have to be so grateful for the last 9 years. He´s leaving us with a competitive team and the transition will be fine.
I’m so glad that Jurgen is a Red. I’m so glad he delivered what he said. Jurgen said to me, you know. We’ll win the Premier League, you know. He said so. I’m in love with him and I feel fine. I’m so glad that Jurgen is a Red. I’m so glad he delivered what he said. Jurgen said to me, you know. We’ll win the Premier League, you know. He said so. I’m in love with him and I feel fine.”
Respect to Jurgen klopp he bought life back to Liverpool and the premier league. Wish him the best in his next endeavors😔🔥🔥
If anyone deserves to leave on a high and remain a legend forever, it's Klopp.  He will forever be loved and appreciated.  He put us back on our perch.
Half way through the season?  Just got through to the final?  FA cup on the weekend.. Strange
Just yeah sad, cant have words to describe it. What an incredible man YNWA
И тут я заплакал..
🥲💔🇪🇬💔🥲
he is going to Bayern Munich ! mark my words
My heart is broken
Thank you Jurgen, you brought us hope, you brought us success YNWA you will be missed, you will always be remembered as the greatest of all time that turned Liverpool into its greatest ever
just sad
Рахмет, бар жасаған жұмысыңызға Клопп мырза. 😢
A hard pill to swallow
Good luck klopp your an absolute legend I truly hope you find what you're looking for after Liverpool I'm a Chelsea fan and can honestly say our game is losing one of the best managers in the world may god bless you and help you on you're road the league won't be the same without you 😮
Me checking asap if this is not a april fools joke.
He is the real life Ted Lasso 🥹 appreciate all and support this fantastic man forever ❤
i am not Fan of any Club. But Jürgen you are a Great person with full attention what you do. All the best for you future
Second dad
Klopp came in at the very time I needed Liverpool to do well enough to matter again. I needed something to pay attention to to keep my mind away from the heroin I was addicted to and Liverpool under Klopp had been providing me just that and more. It has been a great great story with him and Liverpool.  He managed to help me reach that extremely crucial point in recovery wherein a recovering addict no longer needs to go back to the drugs to handle changes in his or her life. So, thank you in advance from a very very grateful fan from Aizawl, 🇮🇳
Aah man! It hurts😫
100% class.
Retirement has come time to play golf and relax 👍🇬🇧
Good luck. Proper manager. From a man united fan.
Noooo god please noo😢😢
Maybe Gerard can come back 😂
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
2:11 "I am okay, I'm healthy..." 😭❤️ This Man. 🔴⚽❤️
The worst feelings, understand but have to let go. Always support you boss, and always will.
Love you Jurgen big man.
Is this a joke
Salah and Klopp leave  Liverpool in the next season we will be finished 😢
As a City fan I have so much respect and admiration for this man the Premier league is a weaker place without him..wish him.all the best what a great guy
Keep calm, I know we be struggle with kloop leave, we are LIVERPOOL after all
Oo wow... this is massive
He looks tired.
You’re truly the best! Thank you for everything Mr Klopp. 🙏🏻 We’re Liverpool 💯 YNWA
A team is only as good as its manager.  I think Jurgen is being very modest.
Most honourable exit.The best coach ever!!Painful goodbye but ok boss!!
This is confirming to me that Salah will be sold to Saudi Arabia  Chelsea fan here but first and foremost but I love the game and this is a loos for the game
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I am shocked. Could have waited to announce this later. This changes everything regarding this season too. How will players react etc?
WHAT A M-A-N
Respect for Jürgen Klopp, for his honest statement and all he has done for the club. Nothing but love for this guy! ❤
Legend
I am a Manchester United fan. But I like the way Klopp manages the team and the way he celebrates. And also the way he gives interview. Hats off for the best coach.
YNWA JK THANKS FOR EVERYTHING U PUT INTO THIS CLUB 🥲✌️
We are doomed 😢
❤❤❤
wow...
We're ever he goes he we will never forget him thank you for everything
This is most heartbreaking moment ever, I'm not ready for Klopp to leave Liverpool oh god I hate this. The club feels empty already by hearing this nooo.😭
Thank you legend ❤❤❤  Premier league Champions league  FA cup  Carabao cup  Club world cup  Super cup Turning mid players into some of the worlds best Humiliating big teams Pulling off amazing comebacks Formed one of the greatest premier league trios Forming amazing memories  Thank you jürgen❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ replacing you is gonna be one of the hardest things the club has ever done  YNWA and thank you for the amazing memories when the anthem plays in every match we will always remember what you did for us❤❤❤❤  So once again YNWA and Liverpool till the grave❤❤❤❤❤❤
overrated manager
Tank You Jürgen Klopp I love JK YNWA
YNWA❤️Klopp the best, ever!
💔
Is this Aprils fools day?! NFW!!!! 😭
The outpour of love in the comments shows how much humanity this man has hown and the passon he's shown all the best to him
Klopp will forever be the best manager at the Liverpool thanks t0 him we are where we are
I am crying
Kloppo, nooooo, ich könnte jetzt schon heulen !!!!! You could managed the smallest village club in whatever country: I would follow that club. You will be so missed. Wishing you all the best Gaffer! from a ⚽BVB⚽ and ⚽LFC⚽supporter
My heart was broken 💔. Unbelievable we hope you will turn your decision b/c you mean love❤ Jörgen klopp. You will never walk alone😍
I'ts not only a goodbye to jurgen klopp, I'ts a goodbye to Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool 😭
The world of futbol love you Coach
Danke Sir Jurgen Nobbert Klopp  Thanks for your legacy 😢 Succes in your next carrier and see you again 🎉✨ YNWA and Love from Indonesia 🇮🇩😭♥️
I still don't believe the fact that "Jürgen Klopp is leaving Liverpool this summer"
Gutted😢
The end of an amazing era for Liverpool FC.  Wherever you are Jurgen, you are always in our heart.  All we can do is say thankyou, and wish you nothing but good health and happiness for the future.
We will forever be grateful for what you did. We will miss you so much.  YNWA❤
Thank you for everythig!!!!!
Schade 😔
Respect.
It almost feels like an April fools hoax. The day I was dreading has come. On the flip the fact that he wants to give the club enough time to plan for the succession speaks volumes about KLOPP as a top bloke.
As a Liverpool FC fan, this is very sad news. I hope that Klopp will take a good rest that he always wanted to take to re-charge himself and hopefully, he will return to the Reds for another stint in future. In the meantime, the best way to send off Klopp is to win the quadruple for him & the club with the fans' full support. YNWA.
Thank you, Jurgen!
Liverpool legend forever ❤❤❤❤
😢😢 Jurgen Klopp. An absolute legend. YNWA! ❤❤
As a united fan , i feel sad that he is leaving. Premier league is the best league because of managers like him.
Keegan shanks paisley Kenny…Liverpool always walks on all the best boss love you loads god bless ya x gonna miss ya
I'ts been the worst day of my life 😭😭😭😭
Thankyou for everything gaffer! YNWA!
Klopp take break, rest, enjoy the life, but come back after 3-4 years. Please.
Glad to have been alive to witness this man's guts and glory. What a champion. You will be heavily missed.
Absolutely 💯 wounded.
The downfall begins.😈
Key message for me is he wants to experience a normal life for sometime, if not more. It’s ok having millions of pounds but if you can’t have downtime away from everything it’s not worth it. I hope he has a great time with his family and enjoying himself. We’ll always have 8 years of YouTube videos and content to reminisce. And hopefully in 4 years or so he may even be back. ☮️
Thank you, Normal One. YNWA
The level of intensity and always being on the club activity treadmill means it cannot be sustained unless he delegates more to his staff and becomes akin to a director of football. I am surprised that his family allowed him to be so detached for so long. What a journey he has taken LFC on though! Good for him. I hope he comes back in a different capacity because he fits the club
Bros going to Saudi 🇸🇦 😭
This is so painful
😭😭😭😭
Auf wiedersehen schatz Ubermensch
I will miss you sir , Thank you for your service.
These are the realest tears ive cried in a VERY long time. Damn. Jurgen your name will never be forgotten, your legacy will live forever and Anfield will miss you. YNWA.
the club should be prepared for some rough years, just look at dortmund. since jürgen left his presence is still haunting the club, when hes there its the best time, it feels like someone died when he leaves and in dortmund they still dream of him every day, no manager ever had a chance there after him. you cannot replace him, this will take years if not decades to get over it. again, just look at dortmund. there will always be a time with and a time after klopp
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I’m so happy for him. He shouldn’t feel he has to explain himself. He’s been working like crazy for the longest time, and he chose the perfect moment to announce this. Let’s focus on the season and let’s go Reds❤️
What will LFC do for teeth now?  Good man, all the best for the future
17:11 Respect ❤
Real star of liverpool club..what a humble man
Please don't go😢
💔💔... It's really heartbreaking... But i think we should respect his decision as he needs some break.. Let's just be grateful to his contributions towards Liverpool!... He will always be remembered as one of the greatest manager and person the club has ever seen!.. YNWA Sir Klopp! ... Just remember he was there with us!
Elke B. the minion (and S04 fan) . 😢❤😊 ... what a great man ... if we had more of such honestly 'mates' in politic, too, our world would be sooo much better ... what a fine character!!! Wish him and his family and friends the best ... and join the next games as well ...
Shout out to the interviewer asking some really good questions, gutted to be losing Jurgen but 9 years of some unbelievable successes we have been spoiled as Liverpool fans
As a Real Madrid fan , even though we always have the upper hand against Liverpool .. but kloop was the most difficult manger we've faced .. THANK YOU JURGEN YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE ❤
Good luck to every team coming to Anfield right now, when both the team and the fans will give their absolute everything for Klopps last season.
Not even a liverpool fan this was so emotional man
When he looks into the camera, his eyes lock with mine. its like a member of my own family looking at me. I don't know him, How could I? But the love I have for this man and what he has achieved at our club is immeasurable. I hope you find what you are looking for Jurgen. YNWA ❤
No Klopp, no party. Back to mediocrity for another 25 years.
Klopp you are the best manager, we are as Liverpool big fans & supporters very very sad for this decision that you made, but we respect that and YNWA.
Klopp will be missed not only by Liverpool but by all British football fans. I am a Chelsea supporter but admire this man. I hope that Liverpool will ask Klopp for his import on who they should get to replace him.
Build him a statue
💔
Got to say I’m in tears watching this, been a Liverpool fan all my life about 60 years. We owe this man so so much for what he has achieved and done for our club.Thank you Jurgen , we will certainly miss you but we wish you and your family the very best for the future, YNWA.
We love you klopp. Good luck
This is so heartbreaking ....I would have never imagined that this day has to come so soon.  This man with all his heart and soul and spirit has enlightened the club and all its supporters and not only brought back success....he brought back the belief to everyone, who loves this club.   He symbolized the clubs highest principles and made everyone feel as being part of a family. The players loved him so much and gave everything to make him feel happy and proud.  It will be even more horrible for them than it is for us fans.....just imagine the likes of Trent, Robbo and Virg having to play without him ....they must feel absolutely devasted and heartbroken....  Over the years he really made them.  He formed them into sensational players and characters.  This of course is true for every player in the squad.  Oh my ....what a loss that is ....
Liverpool! Get the adverts off this video please, this ain’t that video!
YNWA ❤ Jurgen
I am a 23 year old Liverpool fan living in Japan. It has been 9 years since I started watching Liverpool games when I was 15 years old, when I heard that Shinji Kagawa's boss was moving to Liverpool. Now my life has been completely changed by Liverpool. Since the game time in Europe is midnight in Japan, I was often scolded for falling asleep in high school class on the days I watched Liverpool games. But there was no choice but to not watch the Liverpool game. To this day, I have never regretted turning on the TV in the middle of the night nine years ago. Thanks boss for giving us a club for the mind 🔥. YNWA!  ※ I am using a translator. Sorry if I am rude.
YNWA❤ BOSS
❤️❤️
Danke Jurgen!
Nope nope nope this isn't happening. I'm done with football for abit
i nan likes klopp and she does not even like football. lol 9 year
HE LEAVING BECAUSE OF VAR AND REF BULLSHIT ENGLISH SYSTEM CORRUPTION..
YNWA KLOOP 🥹🥹
I just love the guy, his passion for his players, the club and the fans is unique and he is a real role model and I wish him all the success for the remainder of this season.  Cheers from Vienna ❤
Does that mean he’s retiring from coaching?
Gutted by this😢
Thanks, you always on my heart I hope you always be happy where ever you go Next manager Liverpool : Xabi Alonso
It I will be my joy to see Klopp manage another epl club like manchester-united, or move to Spanish giants Barcelona or RMA. European football will never be complete without Jurgen Klopp. My hope is to replace him with Xabi Alonso who can do the job in a decade or longer. We love you Klopp. You are a legend.
shocked news
What an incredible human being,, lets go out with a bang jurgen,, you will always be a red,, thankyou for being liverpool manager,, love massive,, YNWA,, ever x
Total respect,  Jürgen. if thats how you feel you've got to do you. thanks for everything, God bless you.
Thank you for your service to the club. Wishing you a wonderful future.
No matter what klopp will always be liverpool.
Klopp I absolutely adore you and everything about you. By far the best coach I’ve ever watched. It’s really heartbreaking to see you leave the club but I understand your decision. Your time with the club will never be forgotten. All the memories you gave us will stay with us. Thank you for everything. YNWA❤
Win one more for klopp put Liverpool back on there perch
I can't believe it, I wish everything is just a dream. I'm not prepared to let you go.... you're Liverpool and Liverpool is you. plz consider again...
Thank you klopp  ! Club legend now let’s get another legend Xabi Alonso can be a great replacement
come to barcelona papito :3
This man isn't normal one. Because he is special one and everything of this club.
Ah be kloppum
I can here the Screams of millions of football fans around the world saying "Nooooooo!"  I am personally gutted - He has been the heart beat of Liverpool FC since he joined
We will miss u klopp.
Thank you jurgen..u ve done a lot of historical milestone here. Legend already for this club
....As a Follow up I think the Liverpool players will pull out every stop possible to win everything they possibly can. I think the next few months are going to be Liverpools in a football sense as they players will be so committed to sending off Klopp in the best possible way.
Thank you for all the amazing years and your honesty Jürgen! You'll Never Walk Alone ❤
We will remember you are the best club in the world 😢😢😢😢😢🪄🪄🪄🪄🪄🪄🪄
Someday you will grace Anfield like legends...❤
I can’t accept it I’m sorry 😣😣😣 but I can respect it I guess good luck in your retirement king 👑
😭 it has been a good time with you as the best manager in many years
If I was him, earning a fixed €24m a year, plus €26m guaranteed advertising income - so €50m.... I'd be pretty happy after eight years of making seriously disgusting money.
Fair enough your a decent guy and a real guy coming from a Manutd fan
ROFLAZZZZZZZ
😢 thanks boss love you boss all the best
damn 😭
Nothing but love for this man only way I can describe it is it feels like I’m losing my father again such a legend and kind hearted man you see him around the city and he doesn’t hesitate to talk to you or let you take a picture nothing but love YNWA jurgen ❤
This news is shocking, i swear i feel like a close friend or family member just took there last breath. Hope the Boss go recharge is battery and i wish him the very best life have to offer. YNWA.
Class act. Very sad day for Liverpool fans. But also the opportunity for fans to enjoy his remaining time at the club. One of the best all time and impossible to not like as a person.
I’m a city fan, but I’m sad to hear this news😔 Klopp is special and definitely one the best manager in Liverpool. He helped Liverpool lift PL, UCL… titles. I wish Klopp the best and hope he can get a good rest after 24 years of being a manager😊
Same shock when Shanks died, everything changes.
This is not the news we’re expecting so soon but we knew sooner or later this news will come 😢 all we can do now is enjoy every moments we have with him for the reminder and let’s end on a high.. thank you Juergen sir for the amazing times YNWA ❤
Klopp is Kop
Who will be left to challenge Pep? All in all, thank you Klopp.
Pure class as usual. Jürgen Klopp is a diamond of a man. I will miss your reign more than any other and that is because of you, not the players or club. I love it all but as much as you hate it, you made it extra special x
United fan here, but no hate here. I remember when Fergue retired it broke us. Klopp joins a select few legendary managers of the Premier league. He is will be missed even as a united fan
Kloppo ❤😪
Good luck boss 😢 YNWA ♥️
17:10…  2026-2027  Germany-Team overtake from Nagelsmann
"I'm like a proper sports car, I can go 140, 160, 180mph no problem. But I'm the only one who sees the tank is going down."
As a Man City fan massive shock this absolutely brilliant manager who will be sadly missed. Only manager and club who’ve challenged us and in some seasons been better then us in last 7 years big respect klopp 👊🏻
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you klopp for everything, you made my childhood and we will never forget you and your service to this club.  YNWA Jurgen Klopp 🥇
❤
I hope we win no trophies now. You don't deserve them quiter.
Liverpool about to experience what manutd have gone through
I am a Utd fan but I hope Liverpool win the prem it would be a nice send off for Klopp.
Vielen Dank, Jürgen, aus Tampa...
A great man who has devoted his life to us for over 8 years. We thank him. We're gutted but we thank him. Please don't appoint Morinho!
It's written in the stars, this season has to be the one where Liverpool equal United's League titles... has to be
Legend. Legend. Legend. Thank you for all the joy you brought to our club. YNWA
Kloopppp why did U doo thissss... Liverpool won't be complete without youuuuu.weee love you kloopppp
Klopp! I’m naming my next kid after you! ❤
I’m so glad that Jurgen is a red ❤🤍
Is it possible that he unhappy with board ? His contract remain until 2026 and I heard a rumor that he may extend his contract and he is doing LFC 2.0 and his habbit he should stay until 2026 acc to the contract. So sadddddd 😢
I’m in tears, i honestly don’t know how to feel, I’m quite young when i was getting into football i never really supported any club i was just someone looking to enjoy the game. My favorite player was Eden hazard so i just used to watch chelsea a lot but then One day watching Liverpool i just felt an emotional attachment to the club way before klopp came and i thought ‘yh this is a club i want to support’ as i became a fan we were not any good i thought we were going to win the league at one point but then the slip happened which had me wondering where do we go as a club from here eventually rodgers got sacked and then we hired klopp. I was very impressed at his Dortmund side but also wary at the same time because of how it ended. All i can say is that how wrong was I. Jurgen I want to thank you so much for what you have done for this club you have brought my best memories to me in my lifetime as a Liverpool fan and you will always have a special place my heart❤️.
We will always love you and your family❤ I'm shocked you haven't burnt out earlier (if that is the reason) Fighting with one hand on your back for so many years is legendary❤ I pray for a good successor and not some hipster yuppie. Also im jealous of Germany that in 1-2 years time will have a new coach for the national team😂
Devastated - by far the best manager we've had since Shankly & Paisley - enormous loss, but we will find a way. YNWA Jurgen & thank you so much!
An absolute legend and its truly devastating to see him go.
Danke Jurgen... You're definitely one of the best we ever had. Good luck and may you have the best journey in your future
Wait klopp living 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
wheres klopp going after Liverpool?
No way a Liverpool fan I'm a Chelsea fan and without shadow of doubt Klopp is respected the way hes developed that Liverpool team also will be a big miss from the Premier League too.
Thank you for everything you did for everyone.❤
It's a very sad thing,he has transformed Liverpool ,I'm in total shock ,and now I'm worried because I wonder who Liverpool will get next season,  Klopp has become a legend at the club and in the premiership. Respect for the best manager in football.  ⚽️⚽️⚽️👍😥
Lovely mention of Darragh there love it
I had liked Jürgen since his time at BVB and was very interested when he announced he was joining LFC. I didn't know much about this club, but over the years I've come to understand why it was always his dream to manage this club: this long history, this passionate symbiosis between fans and team, this atmosphere at Anfield and that soccer is the absolute focus of life for the supporters - that's something extraordinary that we don't know in this way in Germany. I became a Liverpool fan because of him. Danke, Jürgen. LNWA ❤️
should come back as Liverpool sporting director after his break :(
Terima kasih atas dedikasimu selama ini jurgen...  Suka duka telah kopites alami bersamamu. Semoga sukses diperjalanan karirmu selanjutnya...YNWA❤
I remember when Jürgen called it quits in Dortmund. I was very sad that day, felt kind of empty almost. But then again I was so thankful for having been a part of this crazy  ride this guy took us on for seven years. Jürgen Klopp ist ein absoluter Ehrenmann. What a legend! Liverpool is such a great club. My heart goes out to all the supporters who feel a bit heartbroken today.
I am sure that he will coach Dortmund again at one point.
Thank you Jürgen, I really appreciate  what you've done for the club and the fans.   YNWA
I'm young enough 😀 to remember the great Liverpool teams of the 70''s and 80's with Shanks, Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish. With winning the League and Europe and making Pewel a PL force again reminded me of those amazing days of the past. He is without doubt a Liverpool legend and will be sorely missed. I'm gutted he's leaving but we know have to look to getting another great manager to continue Liverpool's amazing legacy of being England most successful club.
I really love you klopp. YNWA, we will always support you
One of greatest managers of all time 💯
He is the soul of the Game. That's why we're all😢
As a lfc and pne fan huge respect to you
Very gutted to say the least but let us help him finish on a high..
A truly great manager and more importantly human being, will miss him greatly.He brought back dignity and respect to the game of football in a time when many treated each other with disrespect. Whoever you support his personality and enthusiasm and sense of fairness was infectious good luck to you and your family my friend .ynwa
All time Liverpool Legend. Will leave a HUGE hole , not just at Anfield, but also for all Liverpool Fans worldwide. Thanks for everything you have done for the club, for the city and for bringing so much happiness to thousands of people during some dark times. YNWA !  Let's rename a stand in honour and as thank you  to this legend of Liverpool FC  ! Forever LFC and forever Jurgen Klopp!!!!!
Lifelong Arsenal fan. Thank you Jurgen Klopp. You made football better. Good luck.
We all knew that such a day will come. Thank you Jürgen for the so many unforgettable moments, players and trophies! You're among the very best of gaffers we have had! As to your possible successor, I think there can be no doubts about it, it's an old Anfield boy, XABI ALONSO! Having played under the likes of Luis Aragones, Vincente Del Bosque, Rafa Benitez, Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola, you can say that he has most certainly learned his trade well under the best of the very best managers the game has ever produced!
HE WILL BE BACK IN UNDER 1 YEAR AT ANOTHER CLUB  He will get bored
BUATKAN PATUNG BUAT JURGEN.. THE LEGEND KLUB, YNWA❤❤
Long story short, Going to Spain essentially. Said the same thing at Dortmund.  Love the guy and all the best to him. Can't say anything bad about him. Good luck to ya Boss man!
KLOPP FOR ENGLAND MANAGER!!!!! LETS GO!
What a great guy, and Im a United supporter. One just has to admire him, irrespective of who you support,  for his outright honesty and sheer dignity. You just have to respect him. I feel sorry for the Liverpool fans loosing such a football legend. We are still trying to replace Sir Alex and Klopp it's going to be equally difficult to replace. Managers such as he don't come along that often. I can see there being a race between United and Liverpool to sign De Zerbi, as I think he is one of the few managers out there who could do a job for both clubs. I would not be surprised to see Klopp managing Germany in the future.
First of all im crying. secondly, let's win literally every competition we're in. Klopp deserves to go out on the highest of notes. wow
My fav coach 😢u r the best of the best top coach for me huge respect for u from madrid fan❤
I'm a supporter of Torino in Italy, but I developed my love and friendship for Liverpool (my second team) because of this man. He's a real hero of my teen years and today indeed. Thank you for everything Kloppo❤, non camminerai mai da solo.
As an Aston Villa fan,I should be really happy about this. As I believe klopp is the best in world and him leaving should weaken Liverpool.  But I will miss this dude,as I say best in the world !   Brought so much to the league and yea will he missed by many,not just Liverpool fans.   Wonder who you lot will go for now,as long as it ain’t Emery it’s all good. Best of luck for the season let’s hope you can win it for klopp
Respect for klopp botton
Just gotta thank this man for everything he's give us sad news but he's done his job may you be blessed on your journey in the next chapter just hope both futures yours and are clubs hit new heights
😢😢😢😢
This is up there with the Shankly exit.  Shocker 😢
Gutted.
I’m a United fan but I gotta respect Klopp, simply because he brought back Liverpool up to where they belong, even though we got thrashed most of the times we’ve faced them 💔 but you gotta respect klopp. Did it without several charges of corruption 😅
Y ou’ll - N ever - W in 🏆 - A gain
Terimakasih jurgen... YNWA❤
Liverpool back to being rubbish hehe
Can i give my LFC merch now back and get my money?  Joke
As a villa fan I can not fault this guy. Always, always respected him and what he's done for the game here, his attitude, his philosophy on the game, his style and his passion. What a top man. His parting message in this to the Liverpool support is perfect.
Undoubtedly one of the very Best Manager we have ever had. As a human being as well as a coach. Let's face it this job is the hardest one because of our expectations. For once in recent years Jürgen has been able to deliver everything we could ask for. One things for sure,Wherever He goes He will "Never Walk Alone". ❤️🙏
Whoa this is breaking news! One of the greatest managers in football! Though he is not done yet this @16:54 this talks about his future. YNWA- Arsenal Fan
Give Anfiekd the title as farewell gift. The club deserves, the fans deserve it and for sure you deserve it as well !!!!  Schwatzgelbe Grüße aus Dortmund !
An exceptional gentleman. Impeccable character in a wealthy sport. All the best Sir.
Whoever replaces Klopp has some very big shoes to fill. I am so sad at the news but that's life.
Don't be sad beceuse this is the end, be thankful beceuse it happened. YNWA❤️
Klopp has sold out to Saudi or Barcelona
No, we demand that coach Klopp stay at Liverpool
Man deserves a statue and a stand named after him. one of the best to ever do it. love you Jurgen
Not a Liverpool Fan, but he was 100% committed to Liverpool. What a run he has had. Just proves it is not easy managing in the Premier League even when you have great players and have had great results. He looks tired. The pressure must be unbelievable.
Thank you Boss ❤🫂🫂🫂🫂
Love you Klopp.
You'll never walk alone Jurgen❤️☯️☮️
😢😢😢😢😢
I love this guy more than most people in my family. Mr klopp I will always be thankful for what you have given us. With a sad heart we say thank you you have become immortal for some of us. Once again thank you YNWA
I feel already sorry for the Manager that will follow him. At Dortmund we are still looking for a replacement. You can't replace a man like him, thats impossible. He is a unicorn
Hope this motivates the team to give him a great send off 🏆🏆🏆🏆
Yep, I'm crying
The most shocking news of a manager leave since the retirement of shankly in 1974
수고하셨습니다...ㅠㅠ
No way
❤❤❤❤❤❤
We understand Jürgen klopp you will always be Liverpool ynwa
I was shocked, saddened, and panicked ...... hopefully there is a replacement of the caliber of Jurgen Klopp, although it is very difficult
I’m Arsenal fan,but the premier will miss him and is character,is funny 😄 moments,is sad moments…legend!!!!!!
YNWA ❤
One reason why I support Liverpool because of this man..
😢😢😢
Man could have left last season but he gave a year more so that the club he adores comes to a stability before he leaves on some1 else hand
This is one of my sadest day
As an Australian Jurgen you have just ruined my Australian day celebrations . In saying that thank you for all the joy you have given to all of us and the trophies. Let’s replace him with a life long Liverpool fan in big Ange . YNWA 😢
Greetings from the BAYERN MUNICH FANCLUB .. we wish KLOPPO and the whole club LFC maximum success on their last journey together .. YNWA
We are finished. Back to oblivion. I cant believe he is doing it in the middle of the season.
I’m a United fan. I desperately wanted Klopp to United back then, but that wasn’t an option, because we’re currently run like a circus under the Glazers…  Watching Liverpool play every now and then, has been a treat on the eye. I love Klopp’s rock and roll style. You’ve finally won a Premier League titles after so many years. The club is currently fighting for the league title. I commend Liverpool to sticking by Klopp, when it was not going so well. Trent is entering his prime, young players are developing great. He’s leaving by the front door, and with a solid foundation to the next manager. This is one of the best managers of the Prem’s history all things considered. Most get sacked, seeing any great manager leaving in this way, astonishing. Legendary if you win the league title.  That said, Klopp has looked absolutely knackered for some time now. Huge respect for listening to yourself and pull the plug for some time, even though things are as good as they are.
Best coach 🖤💛
My boss i Will always miss you boss Thank for for your giving me happiness until now
which is the next lucky team?
😭😭😭
Burn out is a real thing. He’ll be back sooner than later of course.
One of the best. Good luck sir!
Man United fan since 2001, but Klopp will forever be a legend of the game. He came in when Liverpool truly needed a new leader after years of stagnation and win everything he could with nowhere near the money of other clubs at his disposal. He's a great manager who changed the game with his style, and an even better man that highlights the true humanity the sport can bring out of others. He has my utmost respect, without a doubt. 🤝🏾
So his plan was to leave but then the media got wind of it so he’s beating them to the punch. That’s definitely better than the media breaking the story and causing absolute chaos.
It's tough to accept his departure. It seems he repeatedly indicated that he wants to explore other things in life before it's too late and he wants to try it now. Is he gonna enter politics?
Thank you Jürgen ❤️
i guess zidanes comin
For all you have done for our club I will be forever grateful, you are a Legend Jurgen, feel the Love from the fans who adore you for the rest of the season and go out with a bang, I hope you get to parade the EPL trophy around the city this time and we can all give you a proper scouse send off ❤❤❤ We are Liverpool YNWA
Boss you'll be missed 😢
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is up there with the Shankly exit
Manchester United fans attendance  👇
I’m a villain and this hurts 🫂💜🩵 you guys will never walk alone
José anyone ?
Gutted Klopp is leaving. Thank you so much for the memories and the titles. However, what I don't understand why is everyone leaving right Schmatke, Pep Lijnders, Peters etc? Something definitely happened😢
Devastated
R E S P E C T  .... as hard as it is to hear this, I get it ... but you will always be a RED  ..... YNWA
Here I am sitting in my room and crying
I won't even mind if he manages Man United next season...he did a lot for Liverpool.
Thank you Sir for all you've given to the sport, the team, the club, the town, the fans, liv global and every life you have touched being at liverpool.
What a wonderful manager, is Klopp!!!👌🏾❤️⚽️  Always thinking about the players and the club.❤️  It is a sad day, and I wish him well in his future endeavours!He is the only manager that I have known at Liverpool.  I could have chosen to support Man. City or Arsenal, but I gravitated to Liverpool, because of how the football club and the city serve each other, and do it so very well, indeed! The heart of the players and their passion for the game, is nurtured by Klopp and his team.  The source and  ‘reason’ for Liverpool’s football heart was in the heart of the manager. In the heart of Jurgen Klopp!  GO REDS GO!!! ALWAYS LOOKING SKYWARD!!!👌🏾⚽️❤️⚽️❤️⚽️🎶🇹🇹
Real Madrid fan here, I feel bad 😢😢😢
Thank you Jurgen for all the years you have given to the club and fans, I wish you and your family all the best for the future YNWA ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The pit that literally just formed in my stomach. Genuinely can’t imagine LFC without Klopp right now..
He’s probably tired of getting cheated by city every season with them breaking 115 rules and being robbed of titles and especially this year with the VAR rulings he’s a football man and his love is fading because of how embarrassing the premier league is becoming with PGMOL and them doing 0 about city cheating! Our manager! Get him a statue built! Thank you for everything boss you’ll always be a red ❤
💔☹️
Farewell gaffer!
He is leaving exactly the time he said  in his first interview. This man sticks to his goals. So I am not surprised.
Thank you coach we really had a Great time with you we will never forget that you will never walk alone even with other clubs ❤️  For liverpool Fans liverpool will be always THAT Great club we love ❤️
on behalf of egypt i apologize ,   your tenure in liverpool is unmatched with all the memories , players , staff , supporters , liverpolian chants and more . liverpool shined and showed spirit and accomplishments under you mr klopp .  i sincerely apologize and with utmost respect thank u . and best of luck.
Simply the greatest. To do what he has at Dortmund and liverpool is unreal.
What a class act Jurgen is. He acts from the heart and so no wonder he is feeling drained for it takes more from you than if you don’t put all your heart into something.
Thankyou for everything ❤❤
I can only think of one thing to say, thank you Jurgen. YNWA
YOU’LL NEVER WALK ALONE MR.KLOPP
Thank you klopp,you changed  liverpool make us champions again after long time ,this is the worst day in 24 years supporting  liverpool,good luck klopp.
Probably for the best, he knows mourihno was going to replace him.
So many grown men crying from now until June
A Genuinely top Guy and Great Manager best wishes for your future with your family MCFC . Top Top bloke
Thank you Klopp ❤
Ynwa we will miss you Mr Liverpool thanks for the memories ynwa we will miss you once are a red always a red
YNWA,best manager since shanks
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I’m not a Liverpool fan, however, I thoroughly respect this man as a human being for his honesty, his dedication and his beliefs. No doubt he will be missed. God bless him
YNWA ❤
I’m a Man Utd fan so obviously happy to see him go. But I think Xavi Alonso could be the next pep 🤦‍♂️
Thanks Klopp bring Liverpool in your best achievement......hope your best career where you go.....respect....
Ohh my god it’s actually happening, loved this man to the core. For last few years, since Klopp took over Liverpool, it was like dream for us Liverpool fans. I was thinking this will go forever, he will stay here forever, we will be Klopp’s Liverpool forever.  Obviously, it’s so hard to see him leaving, but we understand his decision and have nothing but love and best wishes for his future.  But really it is so sad to see him going, it will take some time to actually come in terms with this.  Thank you Jurgen for all these years, all you have given for this wonderful club, everything. YNWA
Jürgen is a huge asset to the PL, not just Liverpool. As a United fan I can only offer my sympathy to the Liverpool fans. Kudos to the man for his class.
YNWA❤ Klopp you’re a legend 🫶🏼
Oh man, this is shocking. I never thought it would be this sooner. Regardless of how things are going at the end of the season, Klopp's reign has been legendary! Wishing all the best till the end of the season!   YNWA, Boss Jürgen!
What a legend
I can’t believe that. With me you are the best soccer coach in the world.. Today is my worst day in my life . Thanks boss . YNWA😢😢😢
I heard Sir Jim Ratcliffe contacted him. Next thing you know, he's resigning from his current post. MUFC!  Nahh, on serious note, i always secretly liked him.
I bleed Chelsea blue but respect Klopp a lot. Happy for us but this video made me sad. Something is up!  The world needs more Jurgen Klopp’s in it.
😭
If I had a god I could worship that would be Jurgen. Thanks you for the ride. So long Jurgen. Gutted. May a fair wind follow you where ever you decide to go and the grass softer under your feet.  YNWA.
Thank you for everything, Boss.
I feel like someone just died😮‍💨😮‍💨
Nooooooo
😢😭😭😭😭😭
Best news so far 😂
wow i am gonna miss you so much hope everything is good and we will succed and see you watch the matches from the side just in another way <3
Boss plis stay.. 😢😢
Real man! Respect!
Is this news really true ? Please Klopp don't go. Liverpool is incomplete without you. This man is made watching football more entertaining
Jürgen Klopp Bundestrainer WM 2026 confirmed :D
We love you jurgen ... you woke the phoenix up from the ashes to flames for that we'll forever be grateful.❤❤❤❤🎉
Gutted. I had respect and admiration if you like for houllier,  roy Evans and rodgers, but I feel as sad as I did when kenny first left the club. Gutted!
Te llevas una parte de mi😢
Can we go all out for Alonso?
I'm proud of him making this decision for himself and doing what's right for HIM. We are all human and we are not invincible, let us finish the season strong and setup the best possibility for the next era. We respect your decision boss, YNWA. Let's go for it Reds
The timing of this is fucking dreadful. Why couldn't he tell us at the end of the season. This will likely demotivate players from winning things this season And I guarantee players will leave cause of this, starting with Salah
56...Doesn't look at all well, considering all the joy..so.."it's a relief". Good decision Klopp.
From doubters to believers. In football and in life, thanks for everything Jurgen…everything.
Heartbreaking. Thank you for everything, boss. Let's make this season one to remember. YNWA.
Fell bad for the team 😂😂😂😂😂
We are screwed
We will love you as always Please make it happens again this season. Thank you Jurgen
Complete and utter shock. We’ll miss him dearly.
I’m very sad😭
Don't want to live anymore...stay Jurgen Love you much...YNWA
I am literally crying rn dude his contract didn't even end man I was not ready for this omg
Australia day 2024...I will remember this day forever..ynwa 🔥 kloppo 🔥
Danke für alles Jürgen.
As a Manchester United fan,  Jurgen earned my respect, and the league is sure going to miss him. Wish you well to whenever next you're heading Klopp. Respect.
well I am a chelsea fan , but i want liverool to win PL this season speacilly for Klopp . love you sir
Its a real blow,  i think the dissapointment and the criticism he got last season  have taken their toll, doing another rebuild  as well, he realised he does not want to keep doing it season after season ,  Question is now who do we find to replace him , its too early for steven he needs a few more years experience, and top managers  are not 2 a penny. But thanks jurgen  you  reinvigorated the club.😢
Amazing Job in Liverpool Thank you Mr. Klopp🙏🏼
LIVERPOOL IS DONE!!!
Oh my god, can’t believe he will be leaving 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I think all the supporters can agree, we will accept your decision boss.   You deserve your rest.
🙌❤️😭
Kloppo is unsackable so that is why he knows he will eventually leave on his own terms
Thank you, Boss, for everything you did for us and the club! ❤ You raised the Phoenix from the ashes. End of an era... Tears, victories, trophies and losses... You gave everything to Liverpool and the fans! Thank you for the energy and keep bravely moving forward! YNWA, Boss! ❤
Shock...Yes....But we have to give Jurgen respect for this decision...Will always be a special part of Liverpool FC for what he has done since he came to the club
This truly is shocking news. Of course Klopp has to do whats best for his health and his family and i am absolutely heartbroken but I would have preferred it they kept this indoors till the end of the season as this news has the potential to unsettle the team.
What a Shocker!!! 🙆🙆‍♂ I cant see a manager who can replace him if not Xavi Alonzo.
คุณคือฮีโร่ของผม
As a United fan, you’ve ruined countless weekends and inflicted a scoreline that I’ll never be able to escape from, yet I’m still saddened that I won’t get to watch a klopp team in the prem again because it was truly one of a kind football❤️
Nooooo , you mean a lot to us , it’s hard to hear this kind of news 😢what a loss 😢💔
A living legend. I'm heartbroking that he is leaving but I back him all the way and respect his decision. We love you Jurgen. Let's give him the send off he deserves and win every trophy we can. YNWA JK  X
I think klopp has probably been diagnosed with something because it just feels wrong. Huge loss to the premier league and to liverpool. My gut says he is ill in some way
I would really like to vote for this man in the next elections. Any country.
As a massive liverpool and klopp fan this is really heartbreaking to say the least
Our manager. Words cannot describe just how much this guy means to this club and us fans. Going to enjoy every last second of Klopp at Liverpool, he is part of the fabric of the club and one of the most inspiring people to ever lead this team.
noooooooooooooooooo waaaaayyy
He is such a class act, leader and person - huge loss - we won't see his like again as our manager 😔
When he joined Liverpool, he said he is the Normal one. I can safely say, he isn't. He is an extraordinary manager who somehow is an even better person. I love him and I am gonna miss him dearly.
I understand Jurgen very well.
Your a legend jurgen, always in our hearts
Despite the surprising decision.  What Jurgen chooses is the best for Liverpool and himself.  Jurgen is a legend for supporters.  All the best for you Jurgen. You'll Never Walk Alone 🙏
This has to be the worst news ever, i’m really wishing that this is all a prank
Thank you for everything Jürgen. For all the memories that will be forever part of many people's lives and will not be forgotten. I remember the 4-0 against Barcelona like it was yesterday. You proved that miracles are possible. Danke.
I'm a Chelsea/ Real Madrid fan but always love and respect Liverpool. Love their fans's passion and enthusiasm and Klopp. He made the modern day Liverpool do dominating. Klopp, You will never Walk alone
Legend, Anfield rocking every game, show him the respect he deserves 👏 🙌
AI these days, this is fake right? RIGHT!?
this isn't a shock for me. I called this 2 years ago when he lost energy. the man needs and deserves a break. he pours everything into the job, and most managers could learn a thing or two from his dedication and passion. wish him best of luck, and pray he does not end up in the MLS. they don't deserve him.
what a man, his faith in Christ is so inspiring. Best of luck Jurgen and God bless you in everything you do going forward.
Xabi please
legend❤
Wish u all the best kloop ur the greatest  i hope all is well and wish u all the best and always remeber you will never walk alone ❤❤
I think this will unite the club over the next few months in a way that will be unprecedented. Thank you Jurgan, thank you for the way you came in, thank you for what’s you’ve done and thank you for the way you’re leaving. Your total class. YNWA ❤
I just punched the wall twelve times and still in disbelief 😢😢❤
Boooo
❤
Cmon the reds go bring the messiah Jurgen all 4 trophies, Thankyou for all your service, your passion and love, football has known no1 like you true Legend
Next year I plan to go to Anfield, and see him in person, hopefully they build statue of him so at least I can get the picture with him :')
What I can say is to thank Mr Klopp for all what he has done for liverpool. For sure he tried his level best 👌. Thank you our manager may God bless you and protect you and gives you happiness always ❤️ 🙏 wish you the best
I can't Hold my Tears
I can't Hold my Tears
I can't Hold my Tears
Fully understood, thank you, Sir, for everything you did. It has been an amazing journey, and I wish you all the best with your future adventures.
🎉Very one  needs to prepare for life after work. Thanks for very things . Liverpool always
Turned out to be a BLACK FRIDAY
cant accpt thiis on🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
As an Arsenal fan I have to say nothing but respect for the man, the league will be a lesser without you.
Thank u for everything jurgen ❤
Absolutely gutted.  I barely watch any football these days, due to the corruption, money involved, and the terrible standard of officiating in the premier league.  I am almost 50, and been a Liverpool fan since a child.  Today, is a very sad day.  Losing a legendary Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, is heartbreaking.  We, as Liverpool fans not only love this man as our manager, we love him for the person he is.  He took Liverpool from being average, to title challengers and winners.  This guy is a hero, and no words can express how sad we feel.  Hopefully he is rewarded by the club with a statue one day, and a key to the city.  We love you Jurgen, we thank you for all you are, and all you’ve done.  YNWA 😢😢😢
Pep done this...Taxi 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im fucking crying
The man is like the dad we all wanted. :(
he should go to ajax
We have been so lucky to have him at our club and the legacy he will leave behind   He has changed LFC and we move on but I cannot feel devastated by the news.  Thanks  JK ❤ YNWA
You have done yourself,the team,and the fans proud.THANKYOU  and we all wish you all the best in any future goals and time now spent with your family
I admire you for making the right choice. You deserve to enjoy life outside the club.
클롭은 리버풀을 다시 한번 최상위로 올려 놓은 최고의 감독입니다. 우리는 절때 그를 잊지 않을 것 입니다. YNWA
A good dancer knows when to exit the dance floor.....
Best of luck Klopp.... Its  better to leave on the high than be sacked because of low performance. 🎉
Now youre have to walk alone without us😢
As a United fan i want to thank you Jurgen Kloop for the excitement for Liverpool they need a statue of him at Annfield for what hes done for them thank you Jurgen
THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE 😢😢😢
this is sad news, no more motivation for Pep to stay in the league unless arteta and others will rise to the occasion.  good luck Klop in future endeavour
Jurgen brought so much emotional intelligence to the job. He seems like a one in a million person
Juergen Klopp brought a deep respect for humanity, a strong faith in God, and a passion for football and footballers to Liverpool and has built amazing teams. I hope he writes a book on leadership because he’s been a role model to me above and beyond all the joy he’s helped to bring me from the teams he put on the pitch. Love this man.
The normal one, craves the normal life. We have been putting too much pressure, responsibility, hope, dreams on him. And he delivered. He brought us joy, gives us hope, let us see the light at the end of the tunnel. He make us dare to dream.   As much as we are unwilling to see this happening, he deserve to put everything down and live his life. He has been carrying our burden for too long.   He will always be remembered, he will always be family. This is Liverpool, this means much more
Jürgen has earned the right to do as he pleases. Thank you for everything. Let's make the next few months special.
Thanks for the video, LFC team. A good long video to talk about everything. I feel better now and I wish him the very, very best.
The end of an era. Thank you master.. YNWA ❤
we will miss you,still a legend at Anfield stadium
Jesus this breaks my heart! but as a fan we go through these things. I hope he does well wherever he goes. I'm bracing myself for the free fall we will have, we're never gonna get the players we need now and prob never get a manager like him unless we get Alonso!
It's probably the hardest thing he's done,you can tell in his voice he was.holding back from not crying. Ynwa he's and always will be a legend
to German National Team?
Klopp😢.
❤❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I also believe that nowadays, you cannot just be a manager; you need to be a father figure and, in fact, a human being who is there in personal situations with your team. I think the Diaz situation was also a key factor in his decision.
Gerard next. Make it happen. No Salah, no Klopp next season. LiVARpool are in the mud 😂
💔💔💔💔💔💔
why would you announce this now midway through the season!? at least wait until the end, come on...
This is Devastating, Liverpool Fc is finished for years to come.
Thanks a lot! Love you and remember YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE ❤️🙌⚽
this sucks
He'll be back
Jurgen we can't accept your decision
JURGEN KLOOP your such an honest man, devastating news yes indeed, however you've gone about the hardest decision to tell the public in a true and honest manner, I take my hat off to you again like I always do, you are Mr Liverpool forever, players can be replaced but just like Shankly you will never be replaced, Our Love For You Will Be Forever More (96)
He looks exhausted hope he has no health issues😂
Dear Klopp thank you for all ❤We love you ,you always be Liverpool legend❤😊🍀🥰we will miss you😢YNWA❤❤❤❤❤😊🥰⚽️
That’s how you leave a job  By winning a quadruple 🤦🏼‍♂️ Best wishes Boss
He gave a bs excuse tbh. Something def happened behind closed doors
Just sacrificed a goat for ya klopp❤
Thank you Jurgen! 9 Years of Klopp’s Liverpool team will be unforgotten,it was a pleasure to witness footballing history as it unfolded🎉🎉❤❤😮
Go with god good man. You are as good a scouser as the Beatles… You and your family are family…
😢😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thx for everything JK! Statue will be built for u!
wow i dont even support Liverpool and its a shock to hear Klopp is leaving, hes been around Liverpool for years and i associate him with the club.... also that peloton advert i keep seeing on Youtube XD :)
I’m gutted! I absolutely love this man! He is an absolute legend and I thank him for what he has done for our team. I wish him all the best and all my love xx
Jose Mourinho is available!!
I can't imagine life without Klopp 😢 I don't dare to imagine too 😔 YNWA!
YNWA Jürgen, thank you for so many things through these wonderful years and good luck in your new projects
Jürgen Klopp Legend, Wondertrainer, awesome human. I love him - how he celebrates, his understanding of the game, his vision as coach on how soccer works and how humans work as players, but also how important a club is. With club I mean the staff, empoyees, the people that come to work everyday - these people define the atmosphere, they shape the quality of the soccer club and they are integral to a clubs success. Thats what Kloppo knows, nurnished and raised to next levels in every station he worked. I have nothing but love, admiration and respect for him ❤❤❤
Thank God! Bring Gerrard on!
As a chelsea fan. I am heartbroken what this man has brought to liverpool Is incredible. I may not be a reds supporter but man it feels like a punch in the gut. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you for everything Jurgen - we all love you
The end of an Era what a coach what a man. As an Arsenal fan I rated him before Liverpool and wanted him after Wenger's Era but Liverpool was his destiny in the end and proved to be one of the best in the world, I wish him nothing but the best and Liverpool lost a legend of the game.
What a manager.  What a message.  We'll miss you, Klopp!
Reason why I watch Liverpool games..a lover of this game how it supposed to be loved
Am gonna be honest this is  terrible news honestly and I don’t even support Liverpool like that but this is a great club and this is a great manager what a sad news man 😢
What a sad day for LFC supporter i'm one of them, cant even think who will replace him yet
❤❤❤
omg I'm speechless! its an end of an era.  Klopp deserves all the accolades, There will be tears but as far as I'm concerned he's a club legend.  He bought unprecedented emotion to the game unlike any other manager I remember.  Fans will question the timing of this announcement but when would it be a good time?  Definitely not at the end of the season!. I wish him all the best for the future. YNWL
Thank you Klopp for all you have done for our club! You have succeeded in leaving a legacy and in helping our team create so many great memories.  YNWA
Jurgen klopp announces stepping down as liverpool fc manager❤ no matter how much he says his absence won't be felt, his charisma,his laughs,his brilliance and the legend he is won't ever be replaced nor forgotten. what a manager he is❤❤❤ YNWA❤ liverpool without Jurgen will be a huge void😢
As a rival fan seeing this shocked me.YNWA kloop
Supported Liverpool since 1957 when my old feller took me to my first game and this counts as one of the worst things that have happened in that time. A great Manager, human being and gentleman, he will be greatly missed but good luck in everything you do Sir, you have earned it.
Thank you for everything you've done for us, Jürgen.   YNWA.
I've never been a die hard fan for any of his teams, but I've always been a fan of his since I've known him. For me, Klopp is one of the guys you can put on the same shelf with Collina.
Xabi Alonso is coming!!! Trust me.
Come to Madrid❤
Jurgen is family! <3
In the middle of a season - This is the worst day of my life
Farewell Lagend
Dignified exit announcement. Klopp “uber alles”
😢😢😢😢
SAD DAY 😢😢😢
Im shocked and a bit broken ❤ed .. love you jurgen. Best wishes

Huge thanks for everything  his done for club.  I will pray to win all trophies this year  as a gift for him. EPL, Evropa league,  EFL cup, FA cup will be your, our Klopp ❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢🥵🥵🥵🥵🙊🙈🙉 please don't go
😭😭😭
Sad times, fantastic manager and personality. Thank you Jurgen YNWA 😢👏🏻
Was asleep and I just woke up to this sad news😢😢😢😢
Respect to you Jurgen from a Utd fan
Harry kane better than Nunez
As a Chelsea fan, this man is a premier league great. Massive respect and wish him the best. Heart-breaking for Liverpool and the prem
He'll and should've a place in every football fans heart, cause there ain't so many "normal ones" out there in football business left. And he always gave his heart for every club he worked with, no matter if it was Mainz, BVB or Liverpool!  There's just one thing I never want to see or hear:  No effing contract with Bayern Munich! 🤬 YNWA Jürgen! ❤
Heart broken
😢😢😢
Nothing but respect for Jürgen Klopp!  Even I am not a Liverpool supporter i think what he has done for the club so far is absolutely legendary. 😊😊
This hurts, but have to always trust in Kloppo! i hope he wins the lot this season, send him off on a high.  YNWA Jurgen ❤
I'm not ready to lose you now😢😢😢
I reckon he will take a break and go and coach a national team
LOVE TO SEE HIM At BARCELONA
nonono.....
I hope to bring Xabi Alonso as my future coach to the club
Looks like Klopp wants to see Xabi at Liverpool. Making way early
We are Liverpool! You are our Hero! ❤
GOD BLESS THE KLOPP ❤
Thanx kloop for all the historical moments ❤❤.. ynwa
We will always be behind him no matter the news of him leaving at the end of this season. We will go to war with this man and help push our team to win every game for the rest of the season then we will give this man the best farewell once we’ve won everything. CMON THE REDS YNWA 🔴🔴🔴
This is so sad. Thank you for your hard work and for these excellent years, Sir!! Respect!
*Jurgen Klopp is the identity of Liverpool Jurgen Klopp is Liverpool Liverpool is Juergen Klopp* ❤  As a united fan huge respect to the Mastermind ❤
No plz
Thank You Boss 💖
Thank you for everything you have done for LFC.😢
He needs a break. But he should take that break and come back. Its mental health and stress that comes with the job these days. Take a break jurgen. I wish you all the best
From the moment Klopp showed Sakho (a fine centre half at the time) the door I knew he was " right" for the club and would always do his best for the club. That is all you can ask of a manager and this decision is him doing what is best for the club (in his opinion anyway).
❤❤❤
No 😢 Boss
Thanks for everything Klopp
This man made me fall in love with the game ❤
Maybe The Real Treasure Was the Friends We Made Along the Way
This gives me a bad feeling on his relationship with tje owners and the future of the club. It's worrying to say the least
I think Pep Lijnders should become our next manager because I don't think and any Liverpool fan won't get use to another manager from another club of sort so with that said, Pep Lijnders will be very perfect for the next generation of the Liverpool squad because we already use to him and he is the next Jurgen Klopp of our next generation in my opinion, yes he might not be on the level Jurgen Klopp is but, he is 100% worthy of that managerial role of Liverpool and he learnt so much from Jurgen Klopp that he is just perfect in my opinion, yes this is sad but in order to move on as a huge European club, we have to let go of our legends of Liverpool FC, hope you guys understand, like my comment if you guys think the same🙏💯
he’s the legend!
Jürgen komm heim nach Mainz. Da kannst du dich ausruhen und Energie tanken!
You are Our father in the earth  ,,,i love klopp
YNWA was my song on my wedding day in 2019 after the Champions League victory and now I’m crying... YNWA Jurgen and thank you for everything ❤ You will always be the heart and soul of Liverpool
He’s leaving to come to Man Utd 🥰🥰🥰
We must win for Jurgen this is crazy
Well done Jurgen Klopp. Top top manager. He's annoyed me at times but i dont think there is 1 fan in world football who wouldnt want him managing there club. Obviously I'm a spurs fan who is still hurting from the CL final but regardless of that he is Top 2 in the world. Every fan of every other premier league club will be happy he's going but its a sad loss for English football on the whole. He's classy, passionate and humble.   Whatever you do Jurgen good luck!! I personally think you'll be managing Harry Kane next year and Xabi Alonso will be back at Liverpool.   What a player he was and a manager he's showing the same class.   All the best 👏🏻🙏🏻👏🏻
Good  luck Jurgen, all the best in your future career
By legend😢😢
Rafa knows the city! Could be him or Stevie G 🤔
Thank you for everything  jurgen YNWA
Thank you Klopp. For the last decade, you and your team gave me happiness and satisfaction more than anything in my life.
Sad to see him go but as a gooner I'm ecstatic
This hurts so bad. As weird as this may sound, I’d give back all the trophy we’ve won just to keep him around. YNWA JURGEN!
I can't think of Liverpool without Klopp
Rah…
We love you Jurgen, no matter. Truly sad day for all Liverpool supporters
Such a very humble and intelligent man, I hope and support Jurgen in his decision to recharge his batteries and enjoy a normal life as a family man, if anyone deserves that Jurgen does... My love and best wishes...... YNWA.
Thank you! I'm korean fan. I will always remember your passion. Goodbye our boss ㅠㅠ
I'm not crying, you're crying 😢 😭 😓
😢😢😢😢😢😢
It's the start to end of an Era 2000-2023 and should expect the hard reality thank you  to all players and  managers to give the legendary Era
Build the man a statue🙏
I'M VERY SAD TO HEAR THIS NEWS, KLOPP WE ALL LOVE YOU😭
😢😢😢😢❤❤❤🫡🫡🫡👏👏👏 klopp
this man brought the league back to Liverpool after 30 years of hurt
He should come back for 2nd stint
We love you Jurgen - I'm not crying, must be a lot of dust in the air (-;
T_T
Thank you the manager of all time, you make me to love Liverpool mor
Just make sure you get the 4 Tropheys before you go.
It heart 💔 to see jurgen leave were we will start from when he leaves
I can't believe this happening
Absolutely gutted my 3 yr old son won't get to grow up watching klopp's liverpool. Let's hope the structures and culture he has built can bring us into the future on the right foot. This man is more than a manager, and it's scary to think of a Liverpool without him.
FOREVER IN MY HEART JURGEN 😢❤
You are number 1 thanks you  klopp
Fair play, Jürgen. Hero vibes. Take care of yourself has to come first.
Heart breaking 💔💔😭
YNWA❤❤
Please tell me this is an AI generated prank video
This hurts man😢 This guy was the only rival to Pep and Man City. I don't see an equivalent in the market of managers who can come in and completely reshape the club. With him gone, I don't see who stops Man city. I wish him all the best. He definitely made me fall in love with Liverpool. I will always remember the gegenpress.  Respect Klopp 🤝. I will miss you man
Thank you Jurgen, we won't forget what you did for this club❤️
Thank you jurgen
Thank you jurgen for every single second that you’ve given to this club, you will never walk alone
I actually shed a tear here. Wow 😢
Thank you, what an amazing time you gave to the futbol community and to Liverpool!! Bravo 👏🏽👏🏽
you are not just a manager, you are a role model. This decision just makes me feel so gutted, absolutely.  thanks for your spirit, your mind, your emotions, and all of your times to transform my lovely club being one of the best teams in the world right now. from doubters to believers.   Forever, Jurgen 🖤 Forever Red ❤
Why man why? This is a very bad news.
Massive Respect to Klopp for being so honest and respectful towards the club & its supporters. Always liked his style of play and wished Man UTD could play such energetic football some day. All The Best Jurgen for whatever you choose to do with your life after this 👍🏼
Not the news I wanted to wake up to .Man this is not good YNWA Klopp
Forever a Liverpool legend through the highs and lows the good times and bad thank you Jurgen YNWA
Jose Mourinho is a realistic replacement.
Klopp❤❤❤
Its so sad man. But lets try to be positive. Xabi Alonso next?
Massive respect for taking this decision. Especially talking about the fact, that at some point the energy is just gone. Very rare for people working on that level and a stark reminder to always take care of yourself first.
Someone tell me I’m dreaming 😢😢😢
Sad to hear this today but he's clearly worn out. He needs to have time out from so much pressure. The success that the club has had since he took over the reins has been outstanding. That takes a lot of energy both mentally and physically.  Thank you Jurgen for all that you have brought to the team, the fans and to the city of Liverpool. You will always be in our hearts x ❤😢
Klopp was Liverpool goodbye Legend❤
my heart is broken
Thank you Jürgen, you changed us from doubters to believers, you will always be a LFC legend, I wish you all the best ~YNWA~
I’ve never, never felt so upset. My first heartbreak in a long, long time.
Auf Wiedersehen Kloppo..
Roy Hodson says he would be interested in returning to Liverpool if asked, 😉
YNWA   Klopp………❤
I hope Klopp gets time to relax and recharge. Who knows maybe he’ll be back in a few years.
I do know what else I say but I wish u health and bless
Zerbi or Alonso if we thinking time and future ,I don't know ,miss the man already ❤
OMG!!! I have to watch every Liverpool's single minute for the rest of the season... Enjoy Klopp's football when we still can... 😢😢😢  THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES!!!
I'm depressed, hopefully the team can finish on a high for the greatest Liverpool manager in my lifetime. YNWA
Such a great person . So nice🌟💕🌟💕
I am a Die ♥ Manchester United Fan  But i always admire Klopp that he done with the limited budget at Liverpool is absolutely masterclass over pep at city.  Huge Respect for the Mastermind ❤
So eloquently and beautifully explained by Jürgen.   The man is an absolute class act.   He owes us nothing.   He has given everything he has for this club and deserves to go when he chooses.   Thank you Jürgen YNWA
Nobody gives more motivation than Klopp, you can see the pure passion in his eyes. A father figure for me and everyone
Plzzz Don't LEAVE 😢😢😢😢😢😢plzzz😭😭
I will love you forever Klopp, the feelings you made me feel since your tenure would not have been possible with any other manager, you said it perfectly, this is a difficult decision for you but I hope we kick on and fight even harder as a fan base and as a club for the rest of the season, ending it with trophies. YNWA ❤
Nothing lasts forever just be glad he even agreed to come in the first place, sad but that's how it goes
Thank you for everything ❤ YNWA
Klopp you have been a raging sun ☀️ and force and a Great Human being that’s why it’s been a wonderful ride full of emotions and wonderful memories ❤️❤️ You will Never Walk Alone Jurgen  We love You Forever xxxx Good luck on your new path xx
😢😢😢
Respect and thank you JK... YNWA
❤❤😢
You is the hero klopp
when mane out i am okay, when boby out i am okay, when hendo, fabinho, and milli out i am okay, cause i trust you we still have you in our side, but i respect every decision you make, remember jurgen, wherever you are, you'll never walk alone, it really breaks my heart
Very sad news.. 😢
Danke Jurgen totally devastated 😢
One of the worst announcements in years
My personal view is that there is more to gain for him in the future than Lfc whose owners are not giving him all what he was needing with regards to the club.If he is saying the reasons sincerely,i wish him good luck.Otherwise,he'll be like all the Saudi bound players.
YNWA ❤️
❤❤
I love him
Dear Jurgen, I don't think You'll ever realise just what You mean to us the Liverpool supporters. I'm at an age where I couldn't remember Us winning the title, so many painfull memories of getting so far yet so far away. Then in October 2015 everything changed, You took over our amazing, beautiful monster of a club. I was sat watching Your first press conference, where You promised a title within 4 years (WOW) You have truely done more than any of us could of dreamed of, You won us our first league title in 30 years. You made My dream come true, for this You will always be a Liverpool icon & a Liverpool legend. You will be missed soo much, thank You for everything Jurgen. For You & Your family ' You'll never walk alone' ❤❤❤
Class act, salt of the Earth. Like how he is giving the club time to find his replacement and not only giving them 2 months at the end of the season to find another coach which hamstrings most clubs. He's a world class winner. you will surely be missed by fans, players and football. YNWA, wish you the best of luck in the future.
Thank you for everything Jurgen, for all the positive memories you have created along with the happiness you created for every supporter. You will be greatly missed. YNWA ❤
안되요..😢😢😢😢 감독이 아니라도 그냥  이사진으로 남아줘요
YNWA 🔴😭
Why now??? This will afect the player, we still alive in all competitions 😢😢😢😢😢😢
I remember the day when he told us that he will leave Dortmund! I know what it means & how it feels...but we have had to respect his decision!  Give him the support that he needs!  The only thing we can /could say:  Thank you Kloppo!   YNWA 🖤💛
Just be thankful we had him, for the rest of our lives we will miss this guy but change has to happen, he needs time with his family and live his own life.
Her was a perfect coach and he made a perfect statement. Sometimes you have to let go. Nah, I need to correct myself: He is and always be with Liverpool.
Man am devastated to learn this...new it was coming somewhere along the line but to recieve the news today just slaps way too different. Thank you Jurgen for all the memories and goodluck in the future🎉
I'm a Barca fan. I love Liverpool a lot. Even after they did the 4-0 against us, I used to root for them in neutral matches just because of the identity Klopp gave them ♥️
Nothing lasts forever and this is one of those moments 💔 thanks for everything and let’s go for the premier league title before you leave….. it’s devastating
This stinks. But hopefully there is a succession plan in place. They have Klopp looking haggard for this interview.
Hmm, maybe he can take over the german national team in may...before the european champinship starts!! 🤔
Before he leave, I want to see Liverpool can archive 4 cups this season with him😿😿
There’s something else happening here. His loss of energy could be a metaphor for something else.
Not even a Liverpool fan, but big props to Jürgen Klopp for this announcement. So important to put your energy and your mental health first. Fantastic example and role model for others. Best wishes for your next step Jürgen.
I Gotta say I Feel his pain Imagine having to hug and high 5 a load of divs every day must be double hard work
thank you Jurgen, won’t be the same without you❤️
The Normal One.. stay healthy and enjoy living a normal life, wish u all the best - YNWA
Klopp has so far left all of his three clubs on his own terms (Mainz, Dortmund, Liverpool). Nobody ever told him to leave. And everywhere his departure created a mix of sadness and gratitude with the clubs and their supporters.  Now these are obviously massive boots to fill. Xabi Alonso would be the obvious candidate  - what a story this would be if he were to go head to head with his former coach Pep Guardiola. Roberto de Zerbi would be another fine and interesting option.
As A Man Utd fan, all I have is nothing but respect for JK his staff and the team they managed to build throughout the years. Fans must love and appreciate football itself, despite the clubs they support and the rivalries, and football lost today. I hope it's not a farewell, but a temporary goodbye from Klopp. Now go and kick some a$$ LIverpool, win the Treble, it would be the perfect end to this incredible journey. Hats down Klopp, football loves you !
💔
😢😢
Pure class. English football will greatly miss him.
How can you do this to me
Thanks for everything sir❤❤
Finally thank god
Thanks Jurgen 😭
Been like a father figure for half our city for nearly a decade. A leader of a man. A hero. A legend. The Boss. YNWA GAFFER ❤
You made a 14y old boy dream 9 years back. Thank you for everything Boss ❤
Thank you for everything Mr Klopp ♥️🤍
Thanks Boss YNWA
I have no words. I am crying
We need De zerbi
Going to madrid
We have to demand a statue for this behemoth of a legend.  It's the least we can do to honour his tenure as one of THE greatest managers in LFC history.  Jurgen, You'll Never EVER Walk Alone.  Thank you 🙏🏾
What?
Best wishes to you what ever you do and thank you for everything!
Der Kaiser, shocking news but we can see you as a human being and you have done more than anyone could of imagined, a legend and the statue is on order, Danke Jurgen god bless. Y.N.W.A.
Thank you so much Mr. Klopp. You were born for Liverpool n thanks God for that.
Thank you Klopp.  We were privileged to have you at the helm.
You can see how upset Jurgen is about leaving which makes it so much more clear how much thought he must have put into this before making the decision Tbh it sounds like he is ready to retire & if that is the case then what an unbelievable career, is Liverpool fans cannot thank you enough for everything 🙏🏻❤️
Jurgen i will be signing your name from the Kop g dont you worry.
Please don't go 😭
Devastated but thank you Jurgen or should I say God, in my eyes irreplaceable YNWA.
Klopp loved liverpool, liverpool loves klopp, YNWA
Guy transformed the club give him his statue thankyou jurgen 🔴

Never felt so low 💔😭
Forever a legend   YNWA
We love you klopp😢
Xabi alonso for next season then? 🤔 or klopp back after a season long break 🤞

First Djokovic losing the Semis now Klopp leaving ☹
I'm almost crying! I'm Indian and i can say that Jurgen was the main reason i started supporting the club .One of the greatest managers of all time .YNWA Jurgen
Give the msn a break .  He's looking Clopped Out .....  Has been for the last few seasons.....
Long live the klopp ❤
Thank you for the memories Jurgen...You have served the club so well and renewed hope in a generation of fans who have not witnessed the heydays and brought in new fans to the club with the style of play you've imparted to the players....I'm sure the Kop will sing your name for many more years to come, even after you've left...
goat
Ничего себе, теперь будет новая эра
Thanks for everything, you have done to our Football Club sir. God Bless you and all of your family.
I’m gonna miss him ❤
It’s because of this man that I became a Liverpool fan, he drew my attention to the rest, players, playing style, everything else.
Thank you for everything you have done. You’ll never walk alone.❤️
Bag of emotions right now  hope we see him out in style and win the lot ! 🔥
클롭 감독님, 리버풀을 맡아 제 생애에 처음으로 리버풀의 리그 우승과 또다른 챔피언스 우승을 보게 해주셔서 마음속에서는 항상 감사함을 가지고 있습니다. 리버풀을 떠난다는 말에 너무 슬프지만, 언젠간 일이였기에... 정말 감사합니다. YNWA!!
I'm absolutly hearthbroken😭 But thank you so so much for all the things you have done for us Jürgen. You are an absolut legend! YNWA! ❤
NO!!!!! PLease God no!
Absolutely heartbreaking news all the best for whatever you do in the future Jurgen let’s hope you get the best send off possible by winning a few more trophies eh haha
I was not mentally ready for this news disheartened i just love both the club and the man
Liverpool are fucked then
no Abah klopp 😥
💔😢
❤❤
❤
s
The rivalry between him and Guardiola was the same as between Ronaldo and Messi. Sad news that England will lose one of the best managers and all of England will miss him.
Gutted absolutely gutted..thank you for all you've done for us JK! ❤
Such a heart breaking News.😢😢😢
He has been and will always be: a giant.
Go and live the life you deserve the life you have provided for yourself its not all about football its about family and being at peace with yourself in the decision you make good luck Jürgen ynwa
I'm crying.
We need Roy Hodgson back.
I feel numb 😢 What an amazing manager we've had!
He obviously wants to leave while we are in a good moment. But we are fucked now no manager in the world can do what he did we will suffer like Manchester United trying to find a good manager. Its Heartbreaking to hear him say it. it's guttering. 😮
i hate and love you klopp
Thank you for bringing Liverpool back to being League title winner and challenger every year.... YNWA... Lots of Luv always!!!
Thank you Jurgen for making Liverpool great again. YNWA
What a man, what an absolutely incredible man! There will never be another Klopp that’s for sure! What a breath of fresh air, not only for us but for football as a whole. Not gonna lie, I’m in bits here but he has to do what he has to do I suppose. Thanks for everything Jurgen, you will NEVER be forgotten! Wishing you all the best in whatever you do in the future. One team, one city, one love ❤❤❤ YNWA
My feelings now Like a heartbroken person, knowing that at the end of next season there will be no more Jagen Klopp😭 I love you, I will never forget you. Thank you for everything. You will never walk alone.
BUILD THIS MAN A STATUE PLEASE 😭😭😭😭😭 YNWA
Always remember when Shankly called it a day totally gutted shocked in disbelief well feeling the same now after all those years fantastic manager and human being.Jurgen you will be sadly missed 😞
Thank you Jurgen, for all you have done for LFC
Thank you for your service king please never manage anyone else🙏🏻❤
What a human . YNWA
Thank you for these amazing years! YNWA! ❤❤❤
this hurts so bad, is insane.
A statue of klopp at anfield now❤
really tough for Liverpool but even crazier to think he may never coach again. Though I doubt it. I think he just needs some time off. And I believe he'll then take the position of coach of the German team. And win the world cup.
YNWA❤❤❤❤
i just wanna cry
I just started watching football few years back because Liverpool entertained me with their amazing players especially salah,mane abd firmino. Their beautiful relationship among player and staffs,the fans and the coach…Jurgen Klop. I am saddened by this news but it is normal right in football,people come and go. Thanks Jurgen Klopp for your contributions.🫡
GUTTED!!! Absolutely gutted. I'm struggling to view Liverpool without this man at the front.. I'm also struggling to see how on earth anyone else could take up the reins.. YNWA Klopp, but god damn I'm gonna miss you
Can't blame him for running out of energy. Built some incredible teams working within a budget. Developed players and found a way. Must have been incredibly frustrating competing against Man City and their gaming of the league through financial doping. In any other era Klopp's Liverpool would have won a lot more.  Klopp's a thoroughly decent human being and an exceptional manager. I wish him all the best, whatever he does, and I really fear for Liverpool in trying to find a replacement. He's left a team with a huge amount of potential though...
Subject yourself to the pressures these guys are subjected, pretty much leave their families for prolong periods of times, no privacy ever, always on a very public platform, super quick results are a must… and then you will understand why their tenures are relatively short even when you are one of the best in the world. Even Guardiola may be close to the same decision. Physically  and mentally it is not an easy pace to sustain for a long time. Good luck Jurgen, it was super fun to watch, thanks for the memories!!
🥺💔❤️
Yurgen klopp xamasi uchun raxmat❤
YNWA
Even though I am an Arsenal fan, this is truly sad news to hear. Thank you Jurgen Klopp for the memories circa 2015-2024. Your passion for the game and Incredible wins were truly memorable. 😢  We wish you all the best in your future endeavours.
I WILL MISSED KLOPP HUG EVERY PLAYER 😢
Sad but even the best of times come to an end. The commitment,effort and energy to do what Jurgen Klopp has achieved at Liverpool is immeasurable. But no matter how much you love your job and the people you work and live alongside,at some point you have to start living your own  life. Klopp has invested everything into his role,whether it's been coaxing and massaging so many personalities,encouraging players,staff and supporters to be the best they can,he's done it. We've been so lucky,blessed almost to have had this man at the helm. So good luck Jurgen and we wish you only happy days ahead. You've earned it.
Just when you think you can’t live the man anymore ❤  Go and win it form him boys!
Let’s go win the league!
😢😢
The team we created. The family we created. The community we built. The trophies we gathered. Klopp isn't just a Liverpool manager, he IS Liverpool. Whatever decision he makes, I'll support, but he'll be missed
He brought heavy metal football to Liverpool. We the fans believed in him. Believed in the football he delivered for us to see and enjoy. He brought us all possible trophies during his tenor. He brought a chemistry to the football team that has not been seen since the 80's & early 90's. He brought numerous records to our archieves. Even when we lost the league by a single point on two ocassions, we still broke records along the way. A true man of class, determination, vision and passion. We the fans of this great club Liverpool love you, appreciate what you have done and wish you all the best in the future. As the Vulcans say: Live Long and Prosper. YNWA Klopp.
Klopp Will be în our heart 😢😢
Xabi Alonso to Liverpool, loading.....
YNWA Jorgen Klopp
Am shocked 😢😢😢😢😢
need to bring alonso as sucessor :(
❤ all the love to Klopp and Ulla WNYA, wherever you go in the future
Absolutely gutted. Legend. YNWA
OK please get Mourinho next.  Mourinho is a secret Liverpool supporter
Thank you Klopp. It has been an honor to watch your work in Liverpool FC. God speed ❤❤
God! I can see how difficult this is for him as well and to announce this now shows his massive respect for the fans and the club. Klopp will forever be a legend here. Love him always man! Good luck in whatever he decides to do next! YNWA💪🏾
Klopp revived my love for the beautiful game, made me love Liverpool. YNWA
Thank you boss 😢 goodbye and good luck sir.
Klopp is a great manager and a good man! He is the best manager, love his tactics and the way his teams always play! You will be missed, but wish you all the best, take care!
Fucking tears man
As a United fan, though this man gave me a horror show 7-0 against united, I still like this manager. He’s a hard worker who has competed against oil money man city with one arm tied.
Peak Mike Tyson could hit me with his strongest punch to the face 100 times and it wouldn’t hurt as much as this does.   I’m so thankful for all he’s done for us all these years. If it wasn’t for PGMOL, he’d be sitting there with 3 Premier League titles.  Thank you Jürgen Norbert Klopp, YNWA ❤
Thanks for the memories KLOPP,,,YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE❤️❤️
SHATTERED 😢
Ooooh so sad, Please don't leave,if you can live here
He is fed up with FSG's mean attitude .. most likely, they have  once again asked Klopp to develop academy players instead of spending money. Enough is enough for him. I, as a supporter, will support whichever club he is going to manage next. I support the style of play, and the style of play he promotes is what I love. His next job would be the German national team manager! I think Salah would also leave at end of this season. He is going to bring a golden era to German national team. Just wait and see!
Klopp is Liverpool ,Built this guy a statue
He just needs some time off... he'll be BACK !
The best way to honour this man is not to build a statue but to build the next generation with the spirit of Klopp.
good things also end. thank you klopp ynwa
He needs a new challenge, totally feel him
Thank you JK  from Thailand🇹🇭
😭😭😭😭😭😭
YNWA Jurgen forever. Thank you for everything.
Listening to Klopp always gives me a bit of hope in humanity. One of the most successful people in recent football history and yet so humble, so smart, so down to earth, emotional and empathic, while still being very rational and reasonable. He is just a person you listen to and know you would trust. He is not sugarcoating things nor dramatizing, he is not pretending to be someone he is not, he just feels so real even in his position of power. He knows when to stand his ground and when to say sorry and explains things to the fans like he is talking to equals, to decent, intelligent human beings, instead of the typical "official talk" targeted at the "stupid masses".
Arsenal fan but big up Jurgen Klopp
Its hard to take, but we understand. Go live your life. We will miss you, no one can replace your presence. Legends 😢
only Liverpool fans would understand how devastated to hear this news, it's not like your average routine periodical club's manager changing, this guy means the world to the fans
In shock, honestly.... can't believe he's actually going to leave. There'll never be another one like you, Jurgen. Thank you for everything.
Stevie G waiting in the wings perhaps?
Thank you very much for your knowdlege, Energy and time  - all the best for your life
He just feels that he cant do the job that he loves 100% anymore and i agree its better to not do the job if you feel you cant be doing it.  Needs a break, time for himself and family.  United fan, but his personality will be missed in EPL. All the love, nothing else ❤️    I respect him and his decision, one of the best football managers world ever seen.
You are  an inspiration my coach.
Klopp asking for not making the next matches about him...probably not gonna happen the fans will sing loud for him and I will enjoy it. Good luck for the future. He deserves his rest
f
Always will be in our hearts Jurgen thank you ❤
He has to take the England job now it’s the only job that would make sense.
He leaves a legacy and it will be immortal... Good Luck to your next career path Jurgen Klopp
You'll never walk alone, Jürgen... ❤
What a dude
”WE ARE LIVERPOOL. WE WENT THROUGH HARDER THINGS TOGETHER. AND YOU WENT THROUGH HARD THINGS BEFORE ME.” Jurgen Klopp.
We’ve been lucky to have you mate ❤ YNWA
I feel sad, really sad. This man made us believe in club, its philosophies and football tradition. he is the  closest manager to Shankly in terms of winning mentality and football philosophy. We love you Jurgen, and totally understand your decision. Its not easy to be competing at level you are, year in year out with same energy and excitement. Now we want to end season at high even more than we actually wanted, We go again Reds!!!! YNWA!!!
Jürgen Klopp , you are one of the best. do not leave without Mo. plz
Thank you, boss. I wish you all the best in your normal life.
All the best in your new ventures Sir. You've been an awesome servant to the Club.  Its a sad day for us supporters.
My Manager forever
When Klopp is gone, many would stop watching football 😢
Absolutely gutted.  Jürgen has more than fulfilled his promise to take us from doubters to believers.  What a journey, what a legacy, what a man!  YNWA
แววตา กังวลจังครับ ไม่รู้ว่าเกิิดอะไรขึ้น แต่เคารพการตัดสินใจของบอสครับ รักเสมอครับ
Annoying person but you cant argue with success.
Hello
You have to walk alone. That's the reality 😢
Thank you Jurgen ❤.
Best Liverpool manager of my lifetime. Once in a generation manager and honestly made me fall back in love with this Liverpool team. My manager ❤ Thank you for everything you have done.
I love this : A difficult decision but a right one. Chaii😢. What a man art thou Jurgen 😢. Beyond the sphere of football you have affected me positively. Your attitude and composure towards life is a different topnotch. As a liverpool fan I can't imagine you are leaving now 😢 but it was a right decision . I love you. We owe you a statue. Kaiii. I learnt how to smile in storm and take necessary actions to scape through. Your tactics in the world of football is genius and to me you are the best MANAGER EVER. RESPECT TO JURGEN KLOPP. 😢🎉🎉🎉❤
😭😭😭
Watching this news made cry for real ...
ОН хочет отдохнуть...ОН еще совсем молод и горяч... Придет время и ОН обязательно вернётся...
❤❤❤❤❤
He looks completly shattered compared when he started 10 y ago.
Statue outside anfield for you!
Thank you Jurgen, from the bottom of my heart. Lots of time now to start planning our strategy to get Xabi Alonso to replace him.
Спасибо Юрген! Какой же Клопп крутой
Whyyyyyyyyyyy?  You was just getting started.
😭😭😭
It feels like oblivion .. what are we going to be without this man ... But let him have a great life ❤
I respect your decision boss. I wish you the best ❤
Jurgen Klopp, YNWA.
Klopp won everything for us. He will always be one of us 🙏 Thank you for the beautiful football and all the victories.
Thank you so much, my gaffer. YNWA❤️
Thank you the “Normal One” for being exactly that: normal. You will be missed 😢 and never forgotten ❤
Huge respect for Klopp. All the best and good luck
City fan,a very honest interview,we will miss you,if you were ours I think we may well  have won several champions league by now.A truly great motivator  who understands his audience,if we don't 4peat I old think of no better winner,good health and luck for the future.
I think it should have been 2 years ago. Many millions of pounds could have been saved due to poor player signings.
He had to go up against PGMOL & its refs, who show their agenda against LFC every single time especially on the Spurs shenanigans earlier this season. And then there's the English media like Sly sports who witch hunted him every time he had progressive notions/suggestions for the betterment of English football. And ofc City and the footballing organizations for allowing that filth club to ignore FFP. No wonder he ran out of energy after all that.
No matter whether Jürgen starts something or ends it, in the end he always leaves love behind.  Jürgen, ich wünsche Dir nur das Beste für deine Zukunft und vielleicht wird der Traum für uns wahr Dich als unser National-Mannschafts-Trainer zu sehen und wenn nicht, ist das vollkommen okay. Du bist und bleibst eine Legende. So ein Leben wie deins, davon können viele nur Träumen. Ganz viel Glück & Gesundheit bei allem was dir noch bevorsteht <3
Don’t accept it. You better be back 😭😭
and now I'm sitting here, somehow alone, reading your comments and tears come to my eyes, as if I were listening to a song from my teenage years, looking back and remembering the good times..YNWA ...viel Glück Jürgen, bleib gesund
I love you klopp
Thank you Klopp❤
Absolute legend, thank you so much for everything. Respect your decision, let’s win a quadruple now❤
Thanks Jürgen for your effort, time, commitment, support and a lot of good things i can't count for the time being. the past 9 years was different and will never forget.  You have inspired a lot of players, fans, people to love and respect and die for Liverpool because of you We have enjoyed with your football style and the level of player that you have chosen, in addition to Persistence and determination to keep trying every season to reach your target  Also, you are a very decent manager as you are supporting your team and take the commitment and pressure on your self instead of your team really you will be missed as a Liverpool manager and as a decent person we have learned a lot from him on the football level and humanity level as well Thanks a million Jürgen for the enjoyable moments that you made for us and for a the football as well We will always supporting you in your carrier and wish you all the best to you and your family as well and the end....FORZA Klopp
Liverpool will be the new man it'd next year....
In another world, if Liverpool can't win any cup this season in exchange for Jurgen staying, me I love Liverpool and I also love Jurgen but if I can trade it I hope Jurgen stays. I know it will be a selfish decision, but I hope Jurgen stays at this club. But I respect Jurgen's decision and wish Jurgen all the best, a sad ending for Liverpool😭😭
Build the Man Statue ..
My favourite manager despite chealsea fan Jurgen klopp long live God bless u
YNWA LOVE THIS MAN ,Thank you Yürgen you have bought joy to the club and joy to this old liverpool fan
Im shocked right now😢 Thank you Kloop, you are the GOAT of the managers in Liverpool History
Someone needs to check in on John Oliver.  He's going to be struggling today god bless him.
Noooo nooo Jurgen pls don’t goo
How Graceful...Pure Class!!
What a journey it was!!! Forever grateful!!!
I've not cried in years. Wept today. Thanks Jurgen.
the world is crying seeing this 😢
Well, I wasn’t expecting to see this. The prospect of him leaving didn’t seem like it would be a thing until 2025 in my opinion. Danke Jürgen 🇩🇪 💪, thanks for the memories and all the success you bought to the club over the last 8 years. I really wish you could stay a bit longer but you deserve what’s best for you.
Xabi Alonso, please!
Klopp❤❤❤❤
Im an Arsenal fan and was so mad when Arsenal didn't approach him before he went to Liverpool Hes a top manager, I wish him all the best, hes done a fantastic job with Liverpool
For some reason, I’ve always wanted to hate klopp, but I’ve always managed to like the bloke. Probably because I’m a spurs fan 😅. He’ll be missed in the PL and Liverpool will struggle to replace what he has done.. all the best, Jurgen.
Stunned, can't imagine this is happening. Thanks for everything
What a fantastic guy, though not a Liverpool fan, I know everyone loved him.
I love you Klopp, thank you for all the memories.
Thanks❤
now the way for the german national team is paved
ありがとうクロップ。あなたのいないリヴァプールは想像がつかないよ
Genieße dein Leben Jürgen, es gibt auch wichtigeres als Fussball. Du bist und bleibst einer der besten Trainer der Fussballgeschichte.
Luv
Is this news real ...????
Honestly feel like someone has died, really gonna miss this man
The BOSS, The LEGEND...YNWA Jurgen ❤... let's finish this season with all the success we can💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Even though I knew this will happen, but I don't know why it still makes me cry 😢😭.  All the best for you Mr. Klopp❤❤❤  Will always be remembered 👊👊👊
From a City fan its sad 😢
I don't know when Pool will have such a decisive manager next?! Everything was good! Team building, psychology, matchmaking... It leaves a squad with great potential. Replacing it will be a big task! He set the bar very high both personally and professionally! I'm sorry!!! I hope Pool doesn't have a run of canes like MUN after Sir Alex's departure!
Let's win everything together...one more time ❤
💔
Sounds like he's over worked, so why couldn't they hire more staff to take some of the load off klopp?
All good things must come to an end. But this is not the end that I wanted to see. Thank you Jurgen Klopp for some of the most amazing years as a Liverpool Fan
This is hurting. So much. Am feeling sick 😢
Well...... my little son has grown up having a poster of MISTER Jurgen Klopp in his room.  He just announced to me that this poster will remain posted forever! Just as HE will remain in our hearts....! YNWA Mr. Klopp!❤
What a bummer. But also a great, great time
He's overloaded working I think. respect the Boss decision..at least he stays until June...carry on Boss
Damn neighbours cutting onions.
Shocked and gobsmacked
You'll Never Walk Alone
😢
Manutd fan here! YNWA Sir Klopp. Thank you for the joy you brought to Liverpool and football. It was an amazing experience. Taught the world what high standards is. What world class is. How football should be played. RockEndRoll football. Love It. You will forever be a legend. With your supporting team. Have an amazing break. THANK YOU!.
Thank you for everything.. YNWA❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

YNWA ❤ WE LOVE YOU
Build this man a statue!
Klopp is one of the greatest. Very sad news and hard to believe but complete respect to what he and his team have done. Made all LFC fans proud to have someone like him in charge one of the most decent and dignified people aside from being footballing genius. He leaves on his own terms, as it should be. Thank you Jurgen!
Please stay ❤
Legend
One last ride with Klopp 🫡 lets go all the wayy 💪🏼 YNWA ❤
one of the VERY BEST Gaffers Liverpool have ever seen, what a man, what a manager, what a winner.
Clearly jurgen want to enjoy his life after spend almost whole life for football...i can understand it even honestly as a fans ofcourse we would love too see him stay for a long long time....but every journer have an end....wish may god bless you boss and enjoy your life ❤
Please tell me it's a lie, please
Absolute Legend YNWA ❤
Gracias loco. Está temporada será increíble! Yo lo sé.
As a reds fan, my dad and I are completely saddened by his departure. He was, and is one of the greatest coaches Liverpool and the world had. YNWA Klopp, good luck on your next chapter in life! ⚪️🔴
He made the people happy. Thank you for everything Jurgen.
I’m devastated but I understand. What a man, manager, Legend. When he said I’ll never ever manage another English team was enough for me. Love you gaffer. Thankyou. YNWA
😭
The man is a true Liverpool legend. His name will stand alongside Shankly Paisley and Dalglish forever YNWA
I'm not crying you're crying....Thank you Jurgen for making us believe.....(ok I'm crying as well).
come to your friend Henderson at Ajax
For Liverpool fans to be happy Boss please we need to win everything like EFL, FA CUP, EPL AND EUROPA to make your farewell awesome ❤❤❤
♥♥♥
클롭 형님 고생하셨습니다. 푹 쉬시다가 한국 대표팀으로 오시겠어요? 유니폼 색깔도 같고, 지금 한국 대표팀 감독이랑 같은 독일인에 이름까지 "Jürgen Kl"까지 같은 게 이건 운명이 아닌가 싶습니다. 클롭 형님 언제나 건강하시고 저의 제안을 꼭 한 번 생각해주시길 바랍니다. YNWA.
Good for him bad for team!
I have this man’s face tattooed on my leg along with paisley and shanks. Kept me going during personal dark times
crying so hard. i will never be okay after this
You are without doubt the pound for pound best manager in the world. Thank You Jurgen, for everything ❤️🔴
This is what we will continue to remember and miss, Klopp...you are a great coach, genius and patient, it's like a dream to hear this news, but it's real, very sad, isn't it Klopp....😭😭😭💔
Absolutely gutted to hear this but can understand why Klopp needs to do this 💔 Let's hope the boys can win the premiership for him 🏆
Nooooooooooo!!!! No no no no!! Our Klopp! Would’ve won WAY MORE if it wasn’t for 115 charges FC 🥺🥺🥺 this is the saddest day I’ve had for a long time! Good look Jurgen, you’ll never walk alone! Ever! ❤️🙏🏽
Top manager iv witness at Liverpool truly gutted to see the man leave Liverpool. Feels like iv lost a family member he was the spine of Liverpool and I just hope we don't full back to what we was before klopp. We need to get a top manager in to keep us fighting against man city. Will miss u klopp thank u for the great memories ❤️ 😢
For me i hope Kloop stay with the Reds because he  make the new Liverpool maybe the new era for Liverpool🙂
Liverpool please do not consider appointing Jose Mourinho. He would undo all the work Klopp has done in rebuilding the club.
My heart broke right there...❤❤❤❤
gracias , klopp . you are the epitome of modern managers . i understand you are leaving but please dont retire..
i feel fine...😢
An extra league title and europa league title,  if things go well league title
😢😢😢 thank you for everything Jurgen, greatest manager of all time in my opinion ❤
Sad news, and a beautiful interview. Pity it was ruined with a million ads. Nice bit of class shown by the channel 😒
Your gonna have to win the league this season because its all down hill next season without klopp.
Nothing but love and respect for the absolute legend!!!
The man who made our hearts feel passion while watching football. Thank you, YNWA!!!
大将…
I accept Jurgen, the right reasons given and with appropriate time for forward planning. A legend who will always be welcome back
fcking Legend !!!!!!!
CFC fan but huge respect for KLOPP will surely be missed EPL will never be the same again 😢
Inc Alonso
Heartbroken😢  Thank you for all the years of greatness wish you all the best in your future endeavour Klopp  YNWA❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Xavi ur next
Thank you
Just a wonderful human being, couldn't wish for anyone else. YNWA
Noooooo!!!!!!
UNBELIEVABLE ability, track record of leaving every club in much better shape than when he came in.  ALSO seems to be as good a human as he is a manager, which is saying something
why...🥲🥲🥲
I have a feeling this is the way Liverpool deal with sacking him! They show him respekt for what he has done for Liverpool and make him announce that he don't have energy. Class act from Liverpool leaving this legend to quit the way they did
Ilove you klopp
YNWA ❤ Best manager of my life time
Fans: Noooo Pep Guardiola: NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Perfectly said Jurgen, Thank you for explaining your decision.   There will be a time and a place further down the road to be emotional and grateful, sorrowful and hopeful. To reminisce over all the wonderful things of recent years gone by.   The media will now make it about you until the end of the season. It's not a distraction you want and you've specifically asked us as the fans not to do that just yet as we must still remain focused on being the 12th man. You've probably already said words to the same effect to your players and staff and expect them to remain laser focused on our targets exactly as they were before you made this announcement.  We go again.
thank you
Class manager. Best we have ever had. Thanks for all your years. You will be missed. Remember you have to look after yourself
Last season I thought Klopps energy seemed down, we were 2 wins away from winning the quadruple. That would take it out of anyone. This season we've played way above expected, but I feared the same would happen again next year. Klopp you are more than a football manager, you are a teacher, you are a hilarious German, something that we Brits didn't think possible. "If you are in the room, you're are responsible for the atmosphere in that room" I learn't this quote from you. YNWA our gegenpressing football philosopher.
Heartbreaking of course but I can fully understand and appreciate his stand point and if anyone has earned a rest it is that man.  What a legacy he leaves and good luck to whoever steps into those shoes.
black day for LFC
The boys will deliver HIM all trophies this year as a special gift for our legend coach....his the best of the best. A True gentleman with such a great commitment and being honest to the universe. You hv our respect Señor & we're grateful for your presence. May GOD bless you and your family for the years to come.
He's been exceptional turning around the club when he joined. Hi man-management ability from the start was really clear and his personality and morals has been so very important to the culture now at Liverpool. All the players respect him, the staff is world-class within the whole club and he is solely the reason why. The drive and the determination to go again season after season, the player development and most importantly the connection with the fans. He has created so many great moments, so many great teams with a fantastic tactical style. He is such a great man and we have been very lucky to have him.   I could see over last year his energy has dropped in press conferences and I fully respect his decision to have some time out of football for his family and to live a normal life.  I will really miss him for next year and I think it will be a difficult transition with the some of the staff leaving too (I would like to see Pep stay if possible). I really hope that Xabi Alonso will be the next manager as tactically he is exceptional too.   We will always love you Klopp and I think a new stand will be built for you and we will miss you like crazy. For now let's go to the end of the season with everything to the finals and the prem! YNWA!
Goodluck for the future, legend.  ❤ YNWA.
You better leave us with trophies boss.. Appreciate the job you did
Im not even a Liverpool fan but this breaks my heart.
You will forever be in my heart Jurgen, you brought us so many amazing memories ❤
The Mainstand of Anfield should now be renamed The Klopp Stand to remember what this manager has brought to this football club.
liar man
Leave on your own terms Jurgen and come back whenever you want. Thank you for rescuing our club and for everything you have done and will do for the rest of the season ❤
Time for ted lasso
Legendary work, Kloppo! Now please, come save the Nationalmannschaft 🙏🙏🙏  As a german that watches Bundesliga every weekend I would recommend these trainers to you guys:  1. Xabi Alonso 2. Thomas Tuchel (I think he will leave Bayern in the summer, they are just not playing Bayern-level) 3. Marco Rose 4. Nagelsmann (if he leaves NT in the summer)  I put Rose above Nagelsmann because I think Nagelsmann as a person is just not mature enough yet to be in front of a big club, he still makes a lot of questionable decisions, the way he communicates, his behaviour off-pitch. Rose isn't maybe as much a tactics nerd, but I think he is a more stablished personality. Xabi Alonso has less experience as a coach, but he was a world class player, that makes a huge difference, and I think he is just more mature and solid as a person, I put him above Tuchel because Tuchel has a lot of problems dealing with the squad, he puts his own players down in public, he's just a very difficult character to deal with, but he is a good coach overall. Don't even try a british coach, you guys know very well that for some reason, german coaches are better lol
Please don't go!, Liverpool won't be the same without you Jurgen 🥺😭
Kind of sad, but all good things must come to an end
What a brilliant manager Klopp is. I'll definitely miss him in the Premier league, but as a rival supporter I'm glad to see him go. I'd take him at Arsenal before any other manager. Good luck for the future Jürgen.
Best Manager Y.N.W.A ❤😭💔
Thank you Jürgen.
He's putting pressure on his team to win this year. I see you Jurgen!! We non Liverpool supporters see you!!    As for the Liverpool supporting man dem... Condolences - 2025 and beyond is gonna be peak!!!!  And before you start - I'm kidding. As a non Liverpool supporter I completely understand and feel that this is a loss for all football.

end of an era! thank you klopp .pl will not be same after this season.
His spirit will always remain...
we will miss him. YNWA
Klopp is more than just a successful manager, he transforms whole clubs.  Mainz was in the lower leagues, never top flight - since Klopp they’re a solid mid-table Bundesliga team and have been for many many years.  Dortmund was in no man’s land in the mid and late 2000s, rarely in the league’s top 5 - since Klopp they’re Bayern’s biggest rival, challenging every year and known around the world.  Liverpool were struggling to get into European football - since Klopp they’re considered one of the world’s greatest and most feared teams again.  The Klopp effect.
This hurts more than death ❤ YNWA lets just wish him all the best.....THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING KLOPP❤❤❤❤THE GREATEST MANAGER EVER FOR LIVERPOOL❤
thank you boss for everything YNWA <3
We must build a statue outside of the Anfield of Jurgen Klopp, also one stand deserves to be named after him❤
i know there's will be the end of klopp era but this soon ???
Jurgen Klopp has not only built Liverpool Football Club back to the feared machine that conquered England, but abroad too. It's a sad day for the Red half of Merseyside but for the North West and the Premier League as a whole. He will be missed at Anfield, but he will also be missed by opposition teams and fans. Good luck in your next adventures Jurgen!!!!
Jürgen, thank you for everything you've done. Wishing all the best for you and your family ❤
Jürgen Klopp zukünftiger Bundestrainer?
Words cannot express what you have done for me personally. You have my complete respect and love boss YNWA.❤
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Thank you for everything We all love you legend YNWA
From a long time Manchester united supporter, good look in the future you have been a credit to the premier league.
Even tho im not a liverpool supporter, but its still really sad to him go,
Qué tristeza, es una pena la verdad, Yo pensaba que al menos iba a ir el otro por champions league, estaba ilusionado, por la segunda de su cuenta personal 😢
😢
?????nnnooooooo, but anyway heartbroken  to you Jurgen und die family, viel Gluck bis spater.
Real madrid watching this
Help us one last time Herr Klopp. Help convince Xabi Alonso to take over your place if possible. You need your rest,  and your family needs you too, we get it! Please thank Ulla for sharing you with us these few years and thank you very much for the successes for the past 8 years. You are our legend no doubt ranking there amongst our very best managers ever!
As a Dortmund fan, losing him felt like the biggest gut punch imaginable, but from then on I have been following his results over at Liverpool closely. Watching him transform the club, win those rightful EPL and UCL titles and rise as a core member of the red family made me so proud of the man who did wonders for my club as well. Whatever you end up doing next, I’m wishing you only the absolute best, Jürgen. You’ll always have a home both at Dortmund and Liverpool, you’ve made millions of football fans all around the world happy. Thank you 💛
No klopp
This feels like a death
It touched me as I heard this sir u mean alot to me I wish u success in anywhere u go.God please reword u for me in Jesus name. I will miss u sir
Jurgen hinted but never said it. He is tired and has to stop, which probably means he has medical issues that he has to announce later. He also says no other job, so support the man, whatever club you are a fan of. Definitely more to come
Pepijn Lijnders or xavi Alonso ??
😢
Next stop, german national team.. Congrats to them!
Its just sad loosing this legend but what can we do like they say 'All good things comes to a end🔥🫶
FFS! Samaritans will be busy today! I've just watched the whole thing and I am feeling pretty low and I am usually quite positive without any issues. If this news hits hard, focus on the future. Time is a healer....
YNWA
please tell me it's a prank or something 😭😭❤️
Wish him well anywhere he goes
This saddens me dearly😢💔 but non the less thank you very much Klopp for all the trophies and unforgettable moments🫶🏽 you’ll never walk alone❤
great Klopp, he transformed Liverpool into a machine, a powerhouse, my favorite coach, wherever you go I will always accompany and support you ❤️
Come to Fenerbahce
❤
Thank you Juergen for making my life being better with you being Liverpool manager, please Liverpool give pep lijnders a chance
Greatest Manager of the club. Pep and Klopp era is over😭
A true legend. I love LFC and I love Jurgen’s commitment to the game and to Liverpool football club of course.
YNWA you will always be one of us. So sad but can't begrudge you wanting to move on and take some time. You've put so much of yourself into our team you need some left for yourself and your family. Good luck and all our love for the family ❤
I can't believe. I think they're not giving him money to by players.
5:54 🫵
I'm gooner till I die, but I have to say, Jurgen is treasure of Premier League :) Great job for Liverpool and for EPL !!! I tip my hat and applaud..YNWA
10:58 I was expecting that from Klopp 😅
Klopp was what We needed and now we need to give him what he needs  Thanks Jürgen
He made me drop real life tears let’s win the league for the greatest manger ever klopps my hero turned me from a doubter to believer fr
Fair play as a utd fan all the best to you as a red to another red 🤝🏻
I’m crying 😭
More than heartbreaking, but don't think for a sec any real fans won't respect the decision. These super-competetive years has even made it hard for fans to go again, and again, and again. When fans can feel the exhaustion, can only imagine how it feels for the players and manager especially. I just hope and pray Jurgen will always stay around the club, as King Kenny and other great names has done and continue to do so.  A true legend you are. Everything has an end and there would never be a right time to part ways with this charasmatic and fantastic person.   YNWA ❤
Jurgen. You'll definitely Never Walk Alone ❤
I hope zidane Replace klopp after he leaves
Damn…. This is heartbreaking
this has broken my heart
❤❤
Vielen Dank, Herr Klopp, dass Sie unsere Wertschätzung für den Fußball im Allgemeinen geweckt haben. Vielen Dank auch an die gesamte LFC-Community, die uns Freude an Ihrer Arbeit bereitet hat. Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut, aber ich wünsche Ihnen alles Gute bei allem, was Sie tun möchten. Sie sind ein Lehrer auf höchstem Niveau und viele „Schüler“ vergöttern Sie. YNWA.
We love you jurgen forever the greatest manager besides mourinho ive ever seen manage.
nann nnaaaannnnnn wait whatttttttttttt !!!!!!
I'm missing him already. 😔
I’m so sorry you are leaving our club Jürgen..but your health and well being comes first..as well as your family and newest member of your beautiful grandson❣️All the best of happiness and good health to the future Jürgen.Thank you for the wonderful memories and joy you brought us Liverpool supporters 😘♥️♥️♥️
This is truly heartbreaking!!😢
Come on lads win everything on offer this season for Klopp ❤️
Thank you Kloppo
Ja boss u look good go live u life salute ynwa
Thank you Jurgen! 9 Years of Rock and Roll fun! The tears of pain, the tears of joy! Loved it all!
Heartbroken, thank you for everything Jurgen. We will always love you and remember the amazing times you gave us. ❤
😢 why JURDEN KLOPP you and the best manager in PL we going to miss you your a full Liverpool family anyway you go we always love you
Bossss❤
JK will win the league and say goodbye. I believe in him
Jürgen Klopp needs this break, he deserves it. What he’s done for Liverpool has been transformative, passionate and bringing us back to the top. I can see Jürgen coming back to Liverpool but as of now, let’s cherish him and get the last bit of silverware. YNWA
He realised he has signed the wrong players
Nobody could dislike Jürgen Klopp. He's a wonderful human being. I get what hes saying and understand it. Best wishes from West Ham
Much respect to you JK.  Really sad but I respect your decision. Going to miss you like crazy in Liverpool. Understand what you are saying
If u leave u will still be my best manager I saw I have been a liverpool fan for 5
Thank you boss YNWA
I'm so sad this man on the screen 9 years ago promised us that he will win every single trophy and he completed it I hope he also wins the prem this year
😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔🇹🇭
Liverpool, to honour Jürgen Klopp's legacy, please build him a statue at Anfiel. He deserves it. ❤
Waking up at 7am in the US and hearing this has killed my Friday.  This guy is the heart of Liverpool fc. I wish him the best! 😢
unbelievable
Can you please tell me that it’s a joke🥺
I'm in complete shock. I don't even know how to process this.
and then they say we men don't cry😭
I hope if this is just an AI ..😢
It is really very hard to hear Klopp’s words about him leaving and remain calm or in a good mood, even for a neutral fan like myself. Jürgen Klopp and Salah and a lot of LFC players made me personally follow every LFC game and everything PL. But,unfortunately, that’s how life works, waving in dynamic circles of non-stop changes. I wish you all the best dear Jürgen in your future plans in in whatever comes next for you. Thank you for all the joy and the positive feelings you created past few years. Cheers
We now know the truth, your the Prince of an alien planet and you have to go back and save them from annihilation. 👏🏽
Oh god what a disaster 😢 Thanks for everything boss
I don’t buy this something went wrong with the owner of Liverpool.
😫
I m blased to live in era of Jurgen Kloop. YNWA
All the glorious days given by this man, cant comprehend this but will try to understand. Best wishes for the future Jurgen and hope there will be a statue for you when you come back. Make it happen @LiverpoolFC.
Thankz klopp for everything. All the best for the future. 👏👏👏👏👏
Hatur nuhun klopp.. sukses dmna pun berkarir.
I knew this day would come, but didn’t realise it would be this soon. I’m just happy that Jurgen came to us and for the memories that will live forever. One era ends and another begins. YNWA
From a MUFC supporter and a football fan in general , I'm thanking you for all the games and emotions (positive and negative)  that we have experienced in our derbies and beyond.  You definitely  are a great manager and an amazing man. Good look further on and we wish you all the best.
With a limited budget you took Liverpool one hell of a ride!One or two years rest and then coach the German national team.Wish you the best!!
So how do I say goodbye to you? You are the person who made me love Liverpool. Everything went by really quickly.
I understand Klop is 100% dedicated to Liverpool, what the Kop should do now. accept and understand Klop wants to have time for the people around him but wants to say that We will remember you forever.
Thank you for all boss😢 YNWA
thank you for everything  ❤
Klopp has to do what’s best for him no matter what people think. Good luck to him with whatever he decides to do in the future 👍
Make me sad
💔
Hopefully he gives Andre Schürrle a call  🙌🏼
why now men !
It feels like Bob Paisley leaving again, but when Bob left we had a good idea who was going to replace him ...
players come and go,managers are very hard to replace
Never expected this 😔 It feels like a family member leaving.. Absolute legend forever
Bloody hell mate💔
Can't stand Liverpool football club Though there is big respect to this man, he is a class act. He's turned Liverpool around.  However you slice it. Jürgen leaving will leave a big hole. Liverpool will still compete with players they have, but they won't be as.good without him.
The owners don’t respect him enough
why am I crying? I generally does not..........
Last season was draining emotionally and professionally, but Jurgen built incredible team, Liverpool 2.v, the best sending off is winning as many trophies as possible this season. Thanks Jurgen, what a legend.
we love u klopp, Thanks Skipper❤️. YNWA❤️🤍
Ps LFC should produce a black managers jacket with the JK logo on it so us fans can have a memory to own .
thank you for leaving like this man!
💔😭 YNWA
Anfiled it's welcome to you Everytime Klopp ,You are members in Family ❤️🤘
Xavi Alonso to Liverpool????
You will always live rent free in our memories 📝 💖 👏🏽 thank you Jurgen Klopp. 💖 You'll never walk alone!
Plz noooo....😢
Why😢😭😭😭😭?
Thank you Klopp YNWA❤
Thanks for the Great time Jürgen Klopp
You will always be liverpool
Respect Mr Jorgen
This hurts more then a breakup😔😔
I wasn’t even this upset when my wife left me last year!
What a surprise Jürgen! I'm Completely 💔💔💔😢. But never the less your contributions to the club will forever remain in our hearts. YNWA Sir 🔴✊
I love this man. So sad to see him go but I wish him and his family the best.
I love you Man ❤️ YNWA
He's burned out... he needs a long break
"I still am a normal guy but I dont live a normal life for too long now" this gave me goosebumps. He never wanted to be Rich or famous, he did all this just for the Love and Passion of this Sport and the few Clubs he trained. A true competitor. Nothing but respect for this man
Thank you Klopp for all the beautiful memories! ❤❤ You would be always be missed 😢😢😢
😭
He is a living Legend. Mainz, Dortmund, Liverpool: everywhere he managed to leave at  a the possible moment. He is aware about his capabilities, he is aware about his impact energy, but mostly he is a believer in himself.  He teaches us a lot about beliefs and awareness. Thank you Mr. Klopp - a perfect example of a coach, being human in the crazy soccer business. Hope he will get his 1 year sabbatical as a normal human being - it’s time for him to recharge….
this made me cry fr but we love you klopp thank you for everything  forever Liverpool
This is my 4th time watching this video and I am still crying. 😢
😢
😢😢😢😢😢 Yeses...... Thanks Jurgen, I suspect you are heading to manage the German national team. This is tough yerrrr!!! Thank you very much Jurgen.
What a man!! Going to miss him so much but appreciate his honesty as always. Ynwa Jürgen.
Thankyou Jurgen Klopp for everything you've done for the club❤️❤️❤️ YNWA🫶
Absolute legend
I have loved watching Klopp's Liverpool in the way they play and his philosophy.  As a Chelsea he has been formidable.  I think he is one of the top top football men in the game...wish him the very best...
In absolute shock.. you gave your best and made us among the best.. YNWA
no pls
I am a Real Madrid fan, but Jurgen you did one of Most the iconic team ever... Respect❤
I can only speak for myself. Jurgen Klopp, you have my understanding and respect. Big news but you need your normal life and more time to rest. I can accept that. Hard to do but this season can the team win for you. But it is hard. Never forget that you matters more than the things you will do.
Oh man... sooner or later this had to happen but it's sad... he'll be missed. The best coach in the world but in this case it goes far beyond that... a great human being, an empathetic and comitted person, with principles. A true inspiration and motivating man with very positive vibe. We can't thank him enough for everything, footballwise and beyond. All the best for you and your family, thank you, this will be forever your home and thanks for everything. A true legend to be proud about
Humble man. Great manager. Tear in my eye as I write this message... Hope he doesn't announce in the near future that he isn't very well... 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’m telling myself the account was hacked and this is deep faked AI footage. I’m not ready for him to be gone. 😢
Steven Gerrard will be the next manager, Inch Allah ❤.
Somebody Please tell me that is A dream! 😢😭, No no no!!!!😭😭🥹, This can be true, Klopp can’t leave  Liverpool!!! 🥹
คุณจะอยู่ในใจผมตะหลอดไปเยอร์เก้น คล็อปป์ # YNWA❤
Jurgen please don't go💔
I feel we, as Liverpool fans, all took Klopp for granted, ever since he took over and now that he is going, we realize how vulnerable we can become. Thank you Jürgen for building what we all see in the club, that is Liverpool. YNWA.
What a shocker! I wish you just blessings in your next steps Mr. Jurgen Klopp. Danke! 🙏🏽
Man, respect for What you did for Liverpool and european Football, get the rest you deserved And if you need a Coaching Job with less games, i am pretty sure german national Team will be available in one year Or so 😂😂😂😂
After listening to Klopp speech i felt shocked😭Klopp is more than a family in liverpool we love you and appreciated your job with the reds thank you for everything Klopp❤we are always with you master... Anfield will miss your tactics JK, one of the best coach in the planet....we will always remember you as a hero Klopp❤❤❤

Specially you produced special talent like sadio mane, Salah,  Firmino,... Thank you for your special years... Loved your style of football in these special years of your... Thanks for everything...

Always&forever Klopp!
We thank God its arsenal time🎉
Goodbye Klopp❤
The man who you must love, whatever he does... Thank you for everything!
ORIGINAL SPECIAL ONE !!! YNWA. Thank you for everything <3
"HELLO DARKNESS MY FRIEND" Welcome back mediocrity 😂😂😂😂
I am so grateful for the memories but I never thought you would  leave us this early🥲🥲🥲
9:30  "If you look at my career, this career is actually not possible, I would say, because where I'm coming from, ending up as the Manager of Liverpool FC is a fairy tale. It's a very difficult thing to plan, I would say impossible to plan, and difficult to reach. But it's only possible if you are very busy and 100,000% committed to everything you do. When you dedicate your whole life to it, that's what I did. I came here as a normal guy, I am still a normal guy. I just don't live a normal life for too long now. And I don't want to wait until I'm too old for having a normal life. I need at least to give it a try at one point to see how it is. Will I miss it?"   私のキャリアを見てもらえばわかるが、私の出自からリバプールFCのマネージャーになるなんて、本当におとぎ話のようなことで、計画することは不可能で、到達するのも難しい。しかし、それはあなたが非常に忙しく、やること全てに100,000％コミットして、一生を捧げる時にのみ可能だ。それが私がやってきたことだ。私は最初の日から、普通の男としてここに来た。私はまだ普通の男だ。ただ、長い間、普通の人生を送っていないだけだ。そして、自分が年を取りすぎて普通の人生を送れなくなるのを待ちたくない。少なくとも、どうなるか試してみる必要がある。それを逃したことはないが、試してみる必要がある。
Am 34 years of age I follow football love my club Liverpool and am in tears 😧😧 all the best wishes for you champ we thank you so much for your dedication and love you have gave us and will continue till the end ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This feels like it did when Dalglish left and probably what it felt like when Shankly and Paisley left. GUTTED, but thank you for everything. Let's keep going and make him proud .
I know that if there is a meeting there will definitely be a separation. but not so fast, boss😢
In Jurgens first presser"the normal one presser", he said," its not what people think of you when you enter a room, its what they think of you after you leave{or similar}. My good has this man left a lasting impression, not only on us scousers, but the footballing world as a whole.. What a Man,what a manager, ,What a mentor  and most importantly , what a sensational Human Being.. Thank you Jurgen, not since shankly left have i been more shocked  about a manager leaving liverpool,{ actually Kenny leaving after hillsborough was close,}
I'm actually,in tears
Biggest respect for this man, one of the best manager this decade.
Danke Kloppo. After the season, take a well deserved rest. 👏👏👏👏👏
as a brighton fan im sad kloop is going. but you have to respect his honesty he is a great manager and a great guy, and there is  a life after football. best wishes to him
amazing speech with a big heart. I can see why his man management is so good. We love you Jurgen.
Not even a LFC supporter, and I'm crying.  What a great man.  With much respect from this Evertonian.  Love you Jurgen.
Im a United fan and im crying
Kein Fußballgott, ein Mensch, der sich menschlich zeigt. Ich sehe, wie nahe im selbst die Entscheidung geht. Energie ist endlich. Wie das Leben. Vielleicht mal ein paar Jahre Pause....wenn er es aushält. Er wird Liverpool als Legende verlassen und SEHR große Fußspuren hinterlassen. Und wenn er sagt: "Ich werde nie wieder einen Verein in der Premier League trainieren" glaube ich es ihm. 100%. Das wäre nicht bei jedem Trainer so. WE ARE LIVERPOOL. Respekt, schreibt ein FCK-Fan aus Deutschland.
Finally we are getting rid of this clown from the PL. Good riddance.
Let’s get behind him and the team. Send him off with a title!
No need to explain, we more than understand ❤
PLEASE GOD PROOF TO ME I'M IN NIGHTMARE
평범한 사람 평벙한 남자 평범한 레전드 사랑해요 클롭
wife gave him an ultimatum?
I became a late fan, with Klopp. Exceptional club, exceptional manager, exceptional man. Farewell and thank you
Left us with the best squad in my lifetime get him a statue
I am a Liverpool fan who became a fan when you arrived in the 2015-16 season. I was very happy. I will continue to support Liverpool.
Thank you Jurgen Klopp ❤ have a nice break
I'm an United fan and im crying
My heart went out to him in this interview. He is just so balanced, clear-thinking and yet he looked so jaded and vulnerable at times. Yet he delivered this with total honesty, integrity and humility. The man is pure class.  God bless you Jurgen. Thank you and may you be happy and healthy in your new ‘normal’ life. YNWA
Jurgen Klopp's Legacy will always outshine what Guardiola achieved with City. This man took a mid table team in the Premier League to one of the best sides in the Last Decade, First Title in 30 years, the 6th Ucl Trophy. He would've left a legacy. A statue at Anfield is all thats left.
Legend!! Absolut class!
Jürgen Klopp is a S-tier Human!!!!
This is clearly not a personal decision by Klopp to leave Liverpool. There's probably a feud with club owners. How would the entire staff leave at the same time unless there is a huge problem between the owners and the technical staff? This will have huge detrimental consequence on the squad too. Maybe players exodus will start as well. I'm afraid we might be going into the quagmire like Manchester United.
My manager always❤️
I’m so sad
thank you klopp, full respect YNWA
legend
now i am sad, because i will probably never see jurgen klopp in anfield :( Cant get tickets anymore and i am from germany
As a man u fan I'm shocked and gutted hes leaving. Absolute top manager and entertaining guy we need in the game
😢😢😢
No matter the explanation I'm still gutted 😭😭 💔💔💔 but I can't be selfish he deserves that much of a break. I love you even more. Build him a statue
Gutted 😢 absolute legend ❤
Just the one PL title but a great none the less
It will never be the same again. Absolutely gutted.
Why 😢 I will miss klopp
What a manager, what a man. We were blessed. Ty for everything Jürgen. YNWA.
Jürgen, thank you for everything! YNWA
Everybody talking all somber like its a fcukin funeral!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I'm heart broken 💔right now...I just don't know which manager will be good enough for LFC right now. any ways... Thank you Mr Jurgen Klopp for everything you've given us the fans, the team, the management and the city of Liverpool.
YNWA Jurgen ❤thank you so so much -  those of us at a similar age understand !!!🌈✨🌻🙏
❤
We can not all help but be incredibly sad with the news , but we Thank for your dedication to the team over the last 9 years Jurgen . You have bought us excitement and belief and hope for the future. I hope you enjoy a "Normal' life and you and Ulla have a great time together. You will go down as a Legend and would be shocked if there's not a statue in recognition of all your hard work and what you have done for the club the team the fans. Thank you and YNWA JURGEN .
Only respect to this genius Jurgen Klopp since the day one at Liverpool football club! From Arsenal supporter 🤝
Thanks Klopp.. We always trust and respect your decisions.. You absolutely owe us nothing, only that some decisions are just hard for our feelings.. But all the same, if it's a right one, we respect it. Always in our hearts.. Thanks once again
Mainz, Dortmund, Liverpool 🤍💛❤️ we love you. Take a rest.
YNWA Jurgen, thank you for everything .
Thank you, Boss! ❤
Can't say anythings..no accused JK is the greatest Liverpool Manager ever..YNWA
Very shock, but thank you for all these years, good luck in what , you going to do further.
What we owe this man can never be repayed. In my lifetime, I have never felt so connected and grateful to a man I have never met. They say that in life nothing lasts forever, but the influence and legacy that this man will leave behind at our club certainly will. Our city is yours Jurgen, YNWA ❤
It's like my wife left me.. You'll be the best always! 😢
50% klopp is better then any out there
Thank you klopp ❤
Doesn't get to sign Caicedo and Lavia and now he's crying his way out of Liverpool.😂😂😂😂 Bye bro!!!
Love you Jurgen. Always
Salute
Most decisions you've made have been right ones to leave is the RIGHT ONE FOR YOU. You've been brilliant for this club and any right minded person will wish you all the very best wishes for the future
“He was a soldier of Rome, Honour him”
I LOVE YOU 😢❤
I'm just going to put it out there Jose morinio is a free agent
I am a Man UTD fan but this has made me very sad. It's hard to hate this guy. His character and personality are exemplary. 😭
Klopp you are the best🫢😞 I am sad crying don’t know what to do with myself. No matter where you ago you will always be number 1. God bless you and your family. Fantastic manager, human being brilliant strategist. What a loss!😢😭

We love you forever Jurgen
❤ Thanks Boss for all..loses draws wins n trophies❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ always
Liverpool fc akan seperti sebelum klop datang..... Saya takut,
Gutted… I don’t know what the world will be like without Klopp. You realise now… there is no other manager like this man…
When we speak of great managers of LFC we will speak of Shankly, Paisley, Daglish and Klopp. Lets get the quadruple for the Boss lads!!!
Jürgen 'The Boss' Klopp, the news of your decision to depart your managerial position, has saddened me; But the reason(s) you have given are more than justified. And surely, that has made not just myself, but millions of Liverpool fans extremely happy, proud and grateful to you, and your fellow coaching staff i.e. Pep Lijnders, Peter Krawietz.  Yep, let’s finish this season in the very best way possible.  Ps…… Thank you, for changing our mindset in recent years, from doubters to believers.  We will continue being 'believers' now, and beyond.  We, are, Liverpool!  YNWA ✨
Best manager around
Wehhhh im crying 😭😭😭😭
Well deserved rest ❤
Now go Liverpool,  win everything! Say goodbye to him with all the trophies!
He's coming to United 😝
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Liverpool need to Tap up Xabi Alonso he’s the best out their right now !!!!!!
Coming from a United fan, but still: an icon. Please give him a statue at Anfield. A true legend.
The Best!! My Energy is gone with him already 😢
"It's not important what people think when you come in, but what they think when you leave"   He made this next generation believers, filled them with winning memories, gave them feelings us old boys felt back in the day and put a spring back in our steps!   Legend is what I think, get that man a statue and lets win the bloody lot this year.   I thank you Jurgen
Not A liverpool fan but i respect this man even more after watching this. It takes balls to make such hard choices. Considering the stakes….Legendary Coach! Great man football aside!
He will be back one day! Let him load his batteries! YNWA is something that is in you heart forever.
it is a much harder position than we see from out of the pitch. He has right to have some break. Respect to you Jürgen und thanks for everything that you made for this clup. YWNA
I'm really happy as a united fan....very happy klopp you're my big fan . ..I will always miss you.
Very emotional interview, very emotional partying way.  Nevertheless, that's life 'Ces't la vie'.
Love this man, brought everything he could to this club and more. Let's go and win the league and give him the biggest send off with the fans possible! YNWA Jurgen 🔴
My one and only Manager! Jurgen Norbert Klopp! You will be greatly missed and you will allways be welcomed by me, the fans and the club with open arms. YNWA Jurgen! The best Manager we could ever have had! Good Luck with your further endeavors and THANK YOU! For the amazing memories and trophies! You made us belive again.
This is a sad day but look after yourself boss and thank you for everything . Good luck for your future .
Please stay
Football might not have been the same without you.  I know where I was when you came to Liverpool. A period of despair and sadness, but how, I shouted for joy when I heard you were coming to be the new Boss. I just knew the light had come. How true it was with every match, every interview.  You exuded poise and confidence. I still have your very first quote up on my Facebook wall. Now you're leaving, you're leaving me a man beyond my expectations. All I can do to pretend that i can't feel the gravity of this impending loss is shed uncontrollable tears. I adore you mentor, and thanks for leaving honourably and giving us the gift of enjoying each-and-every one of your matches from here on. Always with us. Jurgen Klopp! 2015 - 2024.❤ A father to us all. 🎉
It´s hard to have this character in modern football!! Here you have someone like you and me, explaining his decision making it simple to understand and accept. What a Legend. YNWA.  Respect from SLBenfica supporter !
he is absolute a legend in the history of LFC, shocking news today but he is right, the club need to plan early and we will support him more than ever in the remaining games of the season. thank you and we will miss you a lot, Danke Jurgen
Mad respect for Jurgen. Thank you for everything you did for LFC ❤❤❤
U go klopp salute thanks u
Thank you for making us smile Thank you for making us joy Thank you for making us believe  You'll Never Walk Alone Jürgen❤
This comes too early. Liverpool can not find a Manager like this again. Maybe xabi-alonso will follow his footsteps
I’m so sad
As a lifelong LFC fan I’m sad to see Jürgen leave the club, it’s been a wild and enjoyable ride during his tenure. I do have to say though, after reading so many other people’s comments, it’s amazing to see how many supporters from so many other PL clubs have said such nice things. Thats heartwarming to see and shows what an impact he’s made on English football and the PL. Thanks for your dedication to LFC, you made a huge impression and will leave a fantastic legacy, and you’ll certainly never be forgotten. Enjoy your future Jürgen you’ll always be welcomed back to Anfield with open arms. 🤘
Apparently he is joining Motherwell FC at the end of the season! The Mighty Well will rise again!
Nah man this is fake it cant happen you are joking right 😂😂😭
Thank you Boss.
❤😭
You will never walk alone Jurgen ❤️❤️😭
God Bless our hearts and Kloppo Soul your going to be in our hearts forever Amen xxxx From A New York Irish Scouser
A genuine human being and great guy, respect from a Man United fan...Good luck Herr Klopp
Devastated!! Firstly this man not only changed a team but rejuvenated a city and it’s people.  Liverpool will be indebted to our great manager forever. His legacy success wise was set in stone before this announcement.  The first premiership league in 30 years, European champions and 3 finals, the league cup, the FA cup etc…the list goes on. Without his influence there was no competition with Manchester City the last 5/6 years. The standard and style of football he created will never be forgotten, his acquisition and man management unparalleled, his charisma and personality beyond comparison.  Klopp believes in the moment, in creating the moment, in the magic of the moment. So many moments are etched upon every Liverpool fan’s heart, like a wedding photograph or a birthday celebration. Jurgen did this whilst working on a restricted budget, whilst pushing players and the club to levels we never knew we had. He may have to leave, but his philosophy and impact will continue to run through the blood  and soul of this great team.  The fist punches will be missed, like a maestro conductor, he had the entire Kop in the palm of his hand. This man has given “everything” to Liverpool and we will always love him because of that alone. In his own unique way, he has infiltrated and reignited a fire that was in danger of blowing out. Like Shankly, Paisley and Dalglish, he was the right man at the right time. As the history book of Liverpool continues to be written, his chapters will be as important as anyone who has stepped foot on the infamous and hallowed Anfield turf.  Now in typical Klopp fashion we must and will move on and forwards. Lets win the premiership and another trophy or two, let’s make “more moments” not only because it’s what Liverpool FC do but as a send off to this incredible force of nature.  You’ll Never Walk Alone Jurgen Klopp.  We love you!!❤️.  ❤️🙏⚽️.x
NOOOOOO, DONT LEAVE PLEASE!!
No explanation is needed. We know how much Klopp loves the club and we are forever grateful for what he has given. The last thing I need is for the media to twist his words and make controversial headlines about his departure. Blood is red, and it runs thicker than water. Never walk alone again Klopp.
It's a sad day for football
Klopp will be missed - up there with Shankly and Paisley
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING JURGEN KLOPP 🫡😥
Still can't believe it, We have to win the PL as a proper goodbye YNWA ❤️❤️KLOPP
Jürgen Klopp - 100% honest till the end. The most charismatic Manager ever.
Jurgen please take your decision back please please we need you, we want you😢😢😢😢😢
Im crying... YNWA KLOPP THE GOAT
I immediately get tears in my eyes when I start to listen to what Klopp just saying about something personal and sentimental to me as a Liverpool fan for 34 years (1990-2024). Thank you Sir for everything that you have done for us. Thank you Jurgen Klopp. YNWA
no man, please papa please extend your contract🙏🏻😭
Please dont break my heart like this
Im crying..
i'm crying right now... Thank you Boss!!!
I think the leadership should have waited until the end of the season to announce it, but it can also have a positive impact as the players might want to gift Klopp a parting gift by winning everything.
We all need to get behind this team and manager now and give it everything to the end of the season. Give him the send off he deserves.
Sad to hear this... What happen with project Liverpool 2.0....  Anyway... We always wish you the best where ever you are... YNWA
💔💔💔
I'm crying 😭😭
No klopp🤦
(To give a back-handed compliment) As a United fan, I'm delighted. An excellent manager and servant to the club. He will be hard to replace.
Please don't leave us.
Lets be fair he doesnt care about liverpool he wants the Germany job always has and will have a year out and go there, germany is his real passion he just says stuff like this to please the gullible scousers, MUFC is the biggest and best team in England hahahaha
This is not true how my god 😢😢
dead inside
he said he's gonna win the title and then retire
I will only accept Xabi Alonso as a replacement.... Please don't go Jurgen 😭😭😭😭
Thank you klopp 😭😭😭
'We are Liverpool' Makes one of the hardest decisions of his managing career in his personal life. Still has the presence of mind to maintain professionalism and his commitment to the club. Just tears bro.
Wow. I fucking love you Jurgen, all of us Liverpool fans love you as I'm sure you know. I respect your decision. Let's finish this season as we have started it. YNWA ❤
KLOPP OR NOT WERE TAKING OVER. LIVERPOOL TOP OF THE LEAGUE LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL TOP OF THE LEAGUE
For some reason I had this feeling about a week ago 😬
Absolutely gutted.
Noooo...... Don't go boss..
JK Thanks for everything but now am crying 😭
I can't stop crying Jurgen 😭 YNWA
Long live legend
This man means more to me than most family. Thank you Jurgen, for all those memorable moments. You came to my club and leave it a far better place. You have my gratitude.
Liverpool got sold..Its the real reason he's leaving, he won't be part of sport washing
Печальное развитие событий  Пеп потеряет достойного соперника  Вероятно он тоже уйдёт на пенсия😢😢
As a Sheffield united fan this is a sad day for football he made Liverpool a monster football club again and he made the prem exciting again good luck to you Jurgen
Xabi alonso incoming perfect time to come in
I think with the stress and things he's got depression and needs to walk away for are his own health and mind. Gutted but health comes first. Will miss him very much
I’m truly devastated by this news I just can’t believe I have to say goodbye to the best manager I’ve ever seen in my time supporting Liverpool FC I am so so so grateful for everything Jurgen has achieved with us all the cup wins and especially winning the Premier League words cannot describe how much you mean to this club and us fans I’m so thankful for making me so happy over the last 9 years there will never be another Jurgen Klopp I hope we win every trophy possible to give you the send off you deserve YNWA
THANK YOU!!! ❤❤❤
It will be very difficult for the next manager to take over after this legend   LiverpoolXklopp will forever remain❤
Thank you for all the great memories Jurgen. We will miss you greatly ❤❤
You’ll forever remain in my heart, you’re forever gonna be welcome at my home. I would rather loose a family member but not klopp
Boss 😭 😭😭😭😭😭 my worst fear is now a reality
Thank you Jurgen for all the memories, you'll never walk alone.
You'll never walk alone❤❤❤
Living in Liverpool for 9 years will get to you.

No ;-; let this be a nightmare
Jürgen has to wark at The German National Team. IT costs lower Energy and they really Need him. He will Always be The Wishsolution.
Blablabla
My heart is broken 😢😢😢😢😢
Jürgen, Deutschland wartet auf dich. Damit sich die Liverpool Fans nicht beleidigt fühlen, wenn sie gegen Ihr neues Team spielen,sollten Sie die Deutsche Nationalmannschaft anführen!!! Nicht nach Bayern!!
Absolutely gutted 😢
To day. I'm so bad :(
You'll Never Walk Alone Klopp ♥  You're the best liverpool manager ever   Thank You Klopp and Good Luck for you
All the respect in the world for Klopp and everything he's given to Liverpool. He deserves whatever kind of vacation he chooses to have, and also a statue! YNWA ♥
Thank you Klopp, YNWA.....😢😢😢😢😢
리버풀 팬이라는게 너무 좋았고 자랑스러웠습니다 감독님 존경하고 항상 응원하겠습니다!!
I knew this day eventually would come, but I'm shocked. He deserves to do whatever he wants to, but its sad to see a legend depart. YNWA
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHA bye bye lad off you trot to Real Madrid
We are with you Kloop, you are a legend and will always be apart of this club. Thank you for everything.   YNWA❤

😥😥😥
We all respect your decision and we wish you all the best and thanks for everything that you’ve done in our club!!
Dont go plz 😭😭😭
As a man u supporter, this man is a world class coach and it will be difficult for Liverpool to find anyone as good, it will be seen after a season or 2 that Liverpool will start losing the impact klopp has put in this team.
Arteta vs Pep for few years loading
You deserve nothing less than to leave on your own terms. I hope you find all the happiness in the next part of your journey. We have been lucky and honoured to have you has our boss. We still have four months to go - until then business as usual. 'BOOM!!!'
This ruined my weekend 😭😭
Why? You're contracted until June 2026! Don't Jurgen please!
Thank you Jurgen 😭😭😭😭😓😓😓😓
I am not a Liverpool fan but I will miss him.  I think he is a breath of fresh air in the sport and yes he is one of the best managers they have had in decades.   I wish him the best in the rest of his life, and I hope sincerely they win the title for him this season.
Such honesty. So many can learn from your humility. Thanks for lighting up the Premier league Me Klopp
Legend, thanks for all the memories❤
Massive loss to the league, a huge character and a true leader, everything I would want my Manager at my football club to be. always liked the man, Massive respect.
Heart breaking but this man deserves his rest, thank you Jurgen for everything, you turned us from doubters to believers and you will always be our leader, we love you and youll never walk alone🔴🟥🔴
Liverpool has lost a legend
GOD BLESS YOU JÜRGEN NORBERT KLOPP 🙏🏾❤️
HE WERE A WONDER IN GERMANY TOO. I M CRYING...I THINK HE IS VERY EXHAUSTET... LOVE JÜRGEN FROM LI, HANNOVER ❤❤❤
I would never want to wake up from this dream . Absolutely no one can replace this guy as a manager and as a person in terms of how he represented Liverpool Football Club throughout these years. The void this leaves is huge and will forever stay like that for me. He was the glue that held everything together at the club even when there was unrest among the fan-base against the owners.  Built everything from the ground up. The pattern of football, the relationship between supporters and the players, the academy and many other things which can’t be said. Overachieved year after year and gave a sense of belonging to us all. Tuning in to see his and my team was indeed a dream every single time. I love you, Jurgen!! 🥺 YNWA ❤️
Klopp to barca confirmed
You never walk alone Juergen
Pep and klopp In my opinion are the best rivalry,As a city fan i really respect him from what he does with liverpool
Jurgen, back to Dortmund please😢
Hope the club can bring a manager with passion like juergen... YNWA #
Füll deinen Tank wieder auf Kloppo. Dann entscheide in aller Ruhe wies weiter geht. Du kannst Dir eh alles aussuchen 😊
Thank you Klopp you will go down in history.
As a Liverpool fans this is very shocking to me. I can't imagine Liverpool without Klopp. We will be suffering again.
😭😭😭😭
YNWA boss! Thank you for so many wonderful years!! ❤❤❤❤
I'm a chelsea fan but this is a truly sad day for football Jurgen is a world class coach he not only transformed Liverpool but also has been one of the people to transform the premier league to the powerhouse it is today as a football fan thank you Jurgen you have been amazing and the premier league will miss you as a manager chelsea v liverpool in the cup final may the best team win 🤝🏼
That last statement he said about not making it about him, but make it about the team.. 💯% love that.
I feel so sad, like someone died.
Wow there is physical damage on him A great manager nothing but wish him all best. By the way I m Chelsea fan
Why do this to us now
You tell the Truth  straight from the heart  my friend  you are a good  hu& Family man being  you have done  the right thing  for the Club  for the supporters across  the world, But more still  for your health  And family  and as you have said to live a normal  life thank you so much for your work  that you've done  we will miss you but won't  forget you God go with you and keep you  safe and well you will always  have a home from  home with Us have a wonderful life with your family 😊 with our best wishes  go with you Jurgen Clopp & Family
Now I have allowed this to sink in a bit... This man is so so respectful. So so much more than the "normal one"
Greetings from Austin, Texas. Shocked/Not Shocked. He's has given his all for this organization. There were times during this season where I heard and saw him and he looked tired, worn out from game to game from the stress. It's time for him and his family to move on now to future challenges. YNWA.
It hurts like hell...but its okay. We will always have him in our hearts. Always a Red. In Klopp we believe.
Try everything to get xabi alonso
😢😮
Man..I’m die hard united fan ..but I love this man..I love this man’s energy, passion for the game,for the fans..will miss his fisting celebrations..I’m not a Liverpool fan but I am crying 💔💔💔
As a lifelong Man United fan I can only express so much respect for this genial , fair and impressive man , a good example which other managers could use as a benchmark. I wish him well in whatever the future brings.
I am drowning in tears 💔
2026 season... he'll be Newcastle manager.
Yah padahal aku ngarepnya Jurgen bisa lama latihnya sampe belasan puluhan tahun lagi kayak sir Alex atau Wenger dulu😢  Tapi ya sudahlah, jika itu keputusan beliau😢YNWA
As a gunner, this man made games against us a real challenge, fun to watch and I enjoy watching Liverpool play, the pure emotion and passion that klopp has for the sport is amazing.
WoW 😢😢😢😢😢 Jamaica loves you You'll Never Walk Alone ❤❤❤❤

Its NOT strange. An absolute honourable man. An example of how to be a professional and father figure! Thank you for everything, Jurgenn.
Until the end of the time , YNWA
i tottally understand your point but i am crying inside
If they replace Klopp with Stevie G then I'm done with football for life. Klopp is the only reason the club has any relevance the last few years. It will be sad watching the decline. Thursday night football for life 😢
Thank you Kloppo! You gave everything! Yes, focus on you! Take time with your family! Thank you for restoring this club to the status it has always been! Thank you for helping me  feel connected to a city I have never been to and rejuvenating a happy global community! YNWA
NOOOOOOO
Give him a sabbatical. Let him come back in a year's time when he's recharged his batteries.
He was a true German ambassador, we Germans can be very grateful to have. I feel the pain in Liverpool today and I feel with u. My dream would be to see him as our national team manager next, no offense. Cause in my opinion there is no bigger club than Liverpool, especially because of their fans, best in the world. Lots of love to all of u and to Jürgen.
I don't even want to watch Liverpool play anymore. It's so sad 😢😢😢😢
9 years man, a true legend
💔
this isn't real. Surely this is just for engagement and content creation.
Thank you Jürgen Klopp. Was hoping for one more season and UCL run next season but for all you’ve done, for all we’ve achieved while under you. All I can say is thank you and I wish you the best for your future. ❤️
We will respect and support your decision. We all loved you. You are humble and done all you have to do at Liverpool FC. We wish you good health and happiness in the future. Thanks for bringing many good memories, trophies and the special moments of winning the premier league after 30 years.
Klop, you know, you are the person who gives us hope, success, good times. If possible, please don't go. You are our legend forever. Thank you for everything you have done for us. And good luck
Very sad to see you leave. Huge respect for the many great things you had done. You'll never walk alone, Jurgen
Klopp’s Liverpool team will be unforgotten, it was a pleasure to witness footballing history as it unfolded. If I was a Liverpool supporter I’d be absolutely devastated today
Gutted......absolutely love the man.......we must win the league and champions league for Jurgen.
As a Tottenham fan nothing but respect for the guy world class manager
it hasn't hit me properly that Klopp is leaving and even tho im a barca fan liverpool has always been one of my favorite clubs so to see klopp leaving I cant just believe it he truly was the best manager any club can ask for and i feel like liverpool wont be the same without him.
YNWA MR KLOOP 💔😭
EPL will miss the man...
He needs a statue in Anfield!
I am a Arsenal supporter and it's sad to hear klopp going he has been fantastic for the Premier league
I think you're tired of football and have made too much money. Anyway, thanks for everything and respect for such a decision.
everton fan here fantastic manager good luck for the future
Thank you for everything Klopp ❤️ From the normal one to legend one YNWA
Words cannot describe how much I love you and how happy you have made me at certain times man, I really do love you. A great manager and a even better human being.

I am a little bit younger than Klopp so I've been around LFC for a while. The Klopp era is the greatest era of this football club since King Kenny's time at the club. We loved Rafa and were gutted when he left, we had an odd relationship with Brendan but he almost won us the title so when he left he didn't know if things would get better or worse but life went on. Klopp came in and built us back up and the club will carry on as it has since the 19th century. It is the end of an era and it is sad and it is scary because we don't know what lies ahead. It could be a continuation and and expansion on what Klopp has given us or we could stumble and struggle to find the right man to replace him but we won't do it alone. We will still have so many of these players who are leaders who understand how to continue this culture and we, as fans, have to keep supporting. YNWA
YNWA klopp❤❤❤
First
you are heart of liverpool. YNWA
It will never be the same again🥺💔
This saddens me like the day I found my wife ran off with my best friend. I still miss him.
This is the worst possible scenario.... 😢
Ach komm Jürgen du weißt genau wieso du gehst.   Die nächsten 3-4 Jahre gibt es kein Geld mehr für die Verpflichtung von neuen Spielern.   Und du weißt selber das du die Deutsche Nationalmannschaft coachen willst.
I'm Korean guys, so I don't know English, but any expression in the world is not enough. Thank you Kloop. You'll never walk alone.
We’re gonna love you Klopp I promise you footie won’t be the same 💔💔
NOOOOOOOO 😢😢😢
I don't know what to say or how to feel about this news..He said he is "The normal one" when his first press conference as LFC manager and since that i knew this amazing person is clearly "not normal one" and pure class all the way through until the end. The words "change doubters to believers" is already executed perfectly onto this club, the players, and also for the whole fans everywhere. I love and respect this person and truly just wanna give him a big hug if i ever see him someday and say thank you in person. As liverpool fan who support this club for more than 20 years, this is really heartbreaking to hear but we all know this day would come. Whatever happen to this season, please give this man a deserve proper goodbye and a big statue in the club. YNWA Jurgen Klopp!!
legend YNWA
definitely issues with the board/owners ... im not buying this
Who TF is gonna overturn CITY now! Because it won't be Arteta, Poch, Ange or ETG. All that he gave LIV, with all the pressure & stress that came with it, it visually has taken a toll, the man has aged in 9 yrs like a USA president when he leaves the White House. All the best Football Man! Thanks Deutscher Herr for all you did for the PL!
❤😢
Nice script
😂
this feels like a bad break up… the one you saw coming
Sad day hearing that we've lost Klopp😭🚮 Now idk if we'll be able to even compete against city in the future without Klopp...it's wraps for us now🚶‍♂️
Love this guy wishing him all the best
Mr. Klopp please I don't want You to leave Liverpool.
YNWA Boss.... Please Xabi Alonso, save us.
Shocked and Heart Broken 💔 in an ideal world we’d keep you forever. Respect your  decision. Stay blessed Klopp thank you for everything. We are Liverpool❤️
End of era YNWA
I have bad day on my office, go home, open youtube to entertain myself, and then i saw this. This is broke my heart.
Wow....what a human being.....run out of superlatives for this man. Wishing him and his family all the best for the future. Thank you for giving us wonderful memories.
As a Spurs fan, I am in awe of what Klopp achieved at L'pool and I have respect for him even though we kept losing to them, because I know we lost to a team that is probably the greatest in mentality aside Manchester City. It will be hard to process it but I think it is a good decision given he spent 9 years here.
I was born in Klopp era YNWA
I started watching Liverpool around the time you joined and it was so refreshing to watch a very different kind of attacking football.  Your journey during the Champions league final in 17-18 was by far the most amazing run I had seen till date. I loved every attack, every run, every block in that run. It might have not ended with the win but it inspired me to replicate such efforts in my life. Thank you Jurgen Klopp. Thank you for making not just the club but shaping the never give up mentality in most of the supporters of the club.
wouldnt be shocked if he ended up at Bayern and Alonso at Liverpool
you can never replace an icon Klopp has done wonders with Liverpool FC he will go down in the anals of Liverpool history as one or the best manager ever all the best to you Mr.Jurgen Klopp in what ever you do. YNWA ❤❤
We appreciate everything Klopp has done especially this season going again, but I hope this has no effect on the title challenge run in…  bit of an odd time to come out with this, should’ve at least waited until after the league cup final or Man City game even
I hope u dont leave and will see thRough this club in the champions league and mark ur 10 year
Idk why but this felt like someone died.
If ever you haven’t plan something yet come to Mauritius to end your career by lifting up our football game ❤
Utterly shocked😱
I think he was borderline leaving last season so this was always likely ❤jurgen
Ich verfolge dich seit Mainz 05. Du bist mit Abstand einer der größten und wichtigsten Persönlichkeiten im weltweiten Fußball. So viele haben von dir gelernt, so viele hast du zur Bestform entwickelt, unzählige Fans haben dich ins Herz geschlossen aufgrund deiner aufrechten und ehrlichen Art. Menschen wie du machen den Fußball zu dem, was wir lieben. Du wirst fehlen. You‘ll never walk alone, Jürgen ❤️
We love you, coach ❤
end of an Era....
No matter what happens this season, Jurgen needs a statue at Anfield.
Saddened but not surprised by decision. Difficult to keep up that level of intensity match after match, year after year. Hoping he can  bring home some more silverware this year. Thanks, gaffer. YNWA
JURGEN SAID TO ME YOU KNOW WE'LL WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE YANNO HE SAID SO
Having supported liverpool for 30 years and seeing many greats come and go. This has to be the hardest goodbye.❤. Thanks Jurgen, im not sure i will enjoy supporting liverpool as much now, you are irreplaceable. You gave us everything. ❤
as city fan . am sad 😔  his the only manager dat gave us a good competition 😢
First Nick Saban now this...
Legend
He has followed his principle after 7-8 years he leaves
💔
thank you mr jurgen 😭😭😭😭
The King of coaches.
😢😢😢😢
Thanks for everything Jurgen!
Thank you for everything ❤️
next Germany coach
I accept his decision but ut still huts😢
Nooo 😢😢😢😢😢
My heart is broken
Hey Liverpool!  Jurgen down la! 😭
I idolise him a lot, apart from all the wonderful things he has done with the team and the countless smiles delivered, his personality is something I always gravitated towards. Im sad to see him go but wish him all the happiness and peace he desires and hope to see him back with his trademark tank full of energy. You have my support Jurgen!  Love from Mumbai, India.
absolutely gutted thankyou thankyou  thankyou   LEGEND YNWA
WEhat????? I woke up to this?
The last dance :)
Absolutely gutted, not been this emotional about a manager leaving since the king was sacked, what a man, what a manager…..let’s make this season one for the history books, send this great man on his way with the glory and roar of passion that only this club can bring. YNWA
This news has shocked me....i honestly believed Jurgen would have been here for many more seasons.....im absolutely gutted 😭😭😭😭😭 THANK YOU MR KLOPP FOR THE BEING OUR MANAGER WE ALL ❤❤❤❤  YOU AND WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AN AMAZING  FUTURE 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏......lets go on now and win everything for you....JK RED FOREVER......YNWA ❤
Welcome Madrid 😅😅
What a great guy
Thank you, thank you, thank yoy.   Millions and millions of time.   You are a genius and genius's never walk alone.    Klopp will always be a Red. ❤❤❤❤❤
I miss you boss
This is why he is the best manager around.  So genuine and humble with it.  He will be missed but I knew when Klopp joined he was about preserving his energy and he has given a lot of it to this club.  The players and club owe it to him to go out on a high.  Can see Pep leaving next season as there won’t be any real completion once Klopp leaves.
We will miss a lot if klopp actually leave Liverpool.
Saddest news ever
Wow as a City fan I am absolutely shocked. Klopp has been a worthy adversary and a great opponent in the Premier League and done it the right way and I'm actually really sad he'll be leaving.
Klopp: "I will not manage a club or a COUNTRY for at least a year"  And which COUNTRY would that be German national Jurgen Klopp???
Boss❤
Thank you for your time and effort Klopp, you will forever be a Liverpool Legend. I want a statue of you outside Anfield obviously since you have saved the club in a way. We were 30 years without a title, heartbroken after the last title charge we had. YOU made us believe again. So i am going to believe that this squad that you and your team have built, nurtured and let grow will continur to perform....I am singing YNWA rn and tears are just rolling. Thank you for everything ❤️ YNWA
feels like 9/11 at liverpool
Madrid fan but man this guy  Nothing but respect ❤
I hope he is not sick because I've always notice how he breathes heavily during interviews. Maybe anxiety. I am sad. Liverpool is more than a club. A big family. Will never be the same.
I hope it's Barcelona 😅
Takes a year out, heads to Madrid.
Thank you what you have done for the PL and football in general. You are a legend and will always be. Wishing health and happiness in the future. (Non Liverpool fan). I’ll never forget the game against Brokelona.
The team soul will no longer  same with the new manager...very sad😢😢😢
Liverpool will never be the same without this man.😢
😭💔
Well next we know who is winning the league
Kloop good  ilove liverpool i thailand
This whole fanbase will be on suicide watch
Please be England manager Jurgen.
... es wird unglaublich schwierig für seinen Nachfolger
Salute, I am pretty sure the team and fans will want you to leave on a high, no bigger motivation, after the speech you just made, to keep those players firing on all cylinders and the owners enough time to find a new manager, to carry on your legacy, to fill those big boots, to coin a phrase.
I think Klopp is not going to coach again unless it’s the national team of Germany in a few years.
Respect! As a Chelsea fan
Thank you for your work at two of my favourite teams Liverpool and Dortmund. Especially thank you for beeing you! Best Coach in the world <3
I'm memory To you LFC The Best to PL🏆 UCL🏆 Or FIFACWC 🏆 Coming soon Carabao &FA Premier league /Europa🏆 ready 🤘 . Your idol Coach in my heart , Good luck Mr.Kloop to Next Steped From Thailand 🇹🇭🧡❤️
Why now? Why not leave, when your contract has expired? Don’t understand, but with so many money you can afford it.
Thanks for everything Jurgen❤ I'm not crying until the end of the season. Forever Liverpool YNWA❤🫡
Plz tell me this is a nightmare and I woke up on April 1st 😢 💔
noooooooooooooooooooooooo!
wow I’m an Arsenal support, but since I live near Dortmund, I absolutely adore Klopp. Now it’s pretty hard for me, because I want Arsenal to win the league, but for Jürgen it would be so awesome to leave Liverpool with another championship.
I'm numb with this news.
❤
is hard to say goodbye..
Jurgen had just demonstrated the best way to exit . Luv and support everything he did. All the best . You will never walk alone
😢 Am I Dreaming😢This Is Not Happening Plz Kloppie Dn't.  We Not There Yet Plz. Im Going In a Seizure 😢.  There  Must Be Time 2 Reconsider 😢Plz .U are The Squads nd We as a Liverpool Family  The Head of the nd Our table .plz plz😢😢Jurgen plz dont leave yet😢plz
Call Xavi Alonso!
We will never ever get a manager like him again. Absolutely heartbroken by this. Thank you for everything Jürgen <3
Thank you  for everything you've done with LFC  Mr Jürgen,  we'll remember you forever. Goodbye and good luck in your future endeavors.
Just has to say they gonna win the league 😂
Massive respect for Klopp, for being respectful adversaries against my team, City. The respect i have for Jurgen is right at the top, thank you for your service and thanks for being respectful adversaries during the years we battled. The league will miss you forever, Mr.Jurgen Klopp.
Does anybody call to Xabi Alonso?
والله لو عندي إمكانية ماديه لجعله رئيس نادي ليفربول
This Really Hurts 😢😢  Though everyone at some point in life needs life for himself and no one more deserves it more than the man...  Thanks for Everything BOSS you will be really missed the place wont feel the same anymore.  Liverpool = Kloop !!  Respect U Wl Nvr Wlk Alone !!  Takecare !!
Why release this to the public now? i'm a Chelsea fan and i like Klopp but i can't show him sympathy when we meet in the final. It's cool that you wanted everyone at the club to be ready but the fans didn't need to know especially with 6 months to go!
Genuinely felt as if I was seeing my family every week whilst Klopp's been manager, it's been such a beautiful feeling. This hurts. BUT, if Jürgen wants this, he deserves what he wants for what he's given us. All the best, Danke schön for everything
From the moment when the club announced Jurgen Klopp as the manager for the club, I knew there was no one else more suitable to this club. and the rest was history. The club had won every champion possible under his belt, he made history. He IS the history. The way  he operate the club felt so normal,  it is impossible now to take Jurgen away from Liverpool or the other way around. It is hard to imagine who else could take on the baton and lead the club in such a way as Jurgen did. I am not denying that I am devastated after hearing the annoucenment, but I am respecting Jurgen's decision. No matter where you are from now on, you are always Liverpool FC, and you will always, never walked alone.
Thank you, Gaffer, for an incredible 10 years filled with memories that will forever be etched in our hearts. Your dedication, guidance, and passion for our Club has left an indelible mark on all of us (the fans, the players and the corporation).  As you embark on a new chapter, we sincerely wish you all the best in finding yourself and leading a fulfilling, normal life. The journey ahead may be different, but we are confident that your spirit and resilience will guide you to continued success.  Always remember, "You will never walk alone." The bond forged over the past decade goes beyond the field, and your legacy will endure in the hearts of those you've inspired and coached.  YOU ARE A RED
Enjoy your life 😊 For me he was the most impactful person in PL. Hopefully he will achieve in life every single target as he achieved everything with Liverpool ❤ he was always authentic. Liverpool without you will be never the same 😢❤❤
Health issues going to say
Such a great manager and even better human being ❤ wish him All THE BEST🙏
Can't believe how much I love this man😢😢 YNWA Klopp❤
Roy Hodgson is available.
Thank you for giving us hope again.
"It's not so important what people think when you come in. It's much more important what people feel when you leave."- Jurgen Klopp 2015
Thank you for everything klopp. On to the next coach and I'd rather we go for xabi Alonso or de zerbi
Whatever and whenever he should he"ll always be rememberd...klopp build up the club as it is today...masive what he athieved...
นี้แหละอาวุธลับของเรา
😭
I like your style with DORTMUND and I was happy when you came to Liverpool to bring your style and mentality, so I'm gonna miss your style so much, good luck in your next step 'Jurgen GIGI Preesing'
Sorry to hear that. 😢
😢😢😢😢😢😢Can't believe that you are going best coach ever YNWA
Why now?  Why kill our season mojo by this announcement?  Why not wait till we win the cups then tell the fans.  If Klopp joins another team (German National or Barca or Real Madrid) it will be the biggest sell out of this "so called love for LFC and the people" and his legend will be destroyed.
We pray Steve Gerrard should not come and coach us.
Gutted for him
Believers
Nooooooooooooooooo !😢😱😳🤬
He will came back later ! (I hope)
We love you Klopp
.... der Mann ist einfach großartig ... nicht nur, dass er ein fantastischer Trainer und Manager ist ... er findet sogar den richtigen Zeitpunkt (so es so etwas gibt), um zu gehen ... Chapeau!!!!
Didnt see this coming at all. I am a Arsenal fan but Klopp one of the best managers and it will be sad to see him go wish him all the best.
Dudeee, im crying -_-
Don't cry because he's gonna go, smile because he was here with us for so long ❤❤❤ much love Klopp
😢😢😢
so sad to hear this news but we have done so much under this great leadership of Klopp  but whatever you do my friend all I will say is good luck for the future
Great respect for this man. Bless you Sir
I believe Klopp has really done well for this season...at one point I felt he should've left his time was up but for the fact that he disappointed last season and still managed to fix it himself and his way he really deserves a lot of credit from us the fans and the entire city of Liverpool...we'll never forget his passion and love for the club...we're all grateful to him and wish him success in his next plans and journey 💯 ❤
Its hurt to much to send him away form liverpool.😢😢😢❤❤❤
So sad. Thanks for everything Jurgen.
A normal guy came as a normal guy leave...let this normal dude having a normal life ..he gave everything for us..let his family have him back totally😊..thanks for everything boss jurgen❤
Thank you for improving my mental health. You are a true inspiration. Wishing you the best for you and your family. You’ll never walk alone, ever.
Like EVERY LFC Supporter it's a COMPLETE SHOCK- He's given the best of his Life to OUR GREAT CLUB & MADE US GREAT AGAIN! I would have liked for the news to have stayed in house UNTIL the END OF THE SEASON- but that's life, No one died!!! It's UP TO THE PLAYERS TO USE THIS NEWS AS A CARROT and WIN EVERYTHING FOR HIM!!! That's why He is ONE OF THE GREATEST, He Leaves on his OWN TERMS & NEVER OVER STAY HIS WELCOME, like MOST Managers.  As He said, is Not important what People say when you arrive- it's what they say when you leave- He is Leaving us at the TOP- NOT when we're STRUGGLING! Thank You, JURGEN KLOPP (YNWA) TOTAL RESPECT 2U SIR!!!
Guyyyss..relax..it's a dream..we are about to wake up.
What a great man!
😢
This is a sad news 😢for me mind you I'm a Chelsea fan but I feel bad that Klopp is leaving.  But what's going on at Liverpool I just saw the other news that their director is also leaving?
The reason I have kept believing and supporting liverpool was kloop. So, when liverpool's game was not good, I believe that it would be better. During 9yrs, I absolutely thank you :)  As I am a korean, I am not a good at speaking english well. But in this time, i wanna comment this. Thank you. (But actually im really sad😢)
Damn.  Cant believe it. He is one of my favorite coaches .Thanks for everything
We will never forget you Klopp you will forever be In our hearts YNWA you are like a father to all Liverpool Fans😢😢
To be honest he is leaving the right way, yes its truly a heartbreak for us Scousers, but at least he is not leaving when Liverpool is at its worst. Thank you for everything Klopper you are an absolute legend, you deserve a statue and all our love goes out to you. You made us believe again, and I know we will find the right manager to follow in your footsteps !
😭😭😭😭
As a Liverpool fan and I'm not gonna lie, thishurts more than the Slip,Crystanbul,theHodgson era, the 6-1 loss vs Stoke, the JohnStones goal line clearance, City's comebackvs Villa,Athens 2007,Kiev 2018 and Paris2022 combined Cheers for the memories Jurgen. You deservea well earned rest once everything is said anddone.YWNA
This ruined my day and weekend. I hope the lads will give everything for him and his staff. As a Liverpool fan, I thank you, Mr. Klopp for everything you have done for the club and for the fans.
A champion should retire when he is on top, because he will be remembered as a champion. Jürgen Klopp is a champion today and will be remembered as a champion. He worked hard all his life is time to enjoy a normal life with his loved ones. Everyone have to respect him for what he did for this club and the decision he made.
Thank you for everything, Jurgen!!!   We'll see you in Town on an open top bus before you go!   YNWA
The greatest 💔💔💔
Such a shock   to lose this wonderful man    let's win the league for him   absolutely brilliant man brilliant manager     ❤❤❤❤

PLEASE MR. KLOPP, BECOME A COACH OF POLAND'S NATIONAL TEAM WITH THE LAST CHANCE FOR LEWANDOWSKI TO WIN ANYTHING BESIDES OF BARCA, BAYERN OR BVB
I am Chelsea fan, but I feel great loss if he leave Liverpool and EPL
As a Liverpool fan and I'm not gonna lie, thishurts more than the Slip,Crystanbul,theHodgson era, the 6-1 loss vs Stoke, the JohnStones goal line clearance, City's comebackvs Villa,Athens 2007,Kiev 2018 and Paris2022 combined Cheers for the memories Jurgen.

This man is a legend. It doesn't matter to me that he manages a rival club. There will never be another like him. Such professionalism, such passion, such personality. He is singular.
Not many club managers can convincingly say “we are Liverpool” or any other clubs, Klopp is definitely one of them.
Thank You For Everything Boss   😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wat a Man ...a Genuine football person.... respect from Madridista's
Our leader and teacher , thank you for everything ❤❤❤
Thank you and good luck. Incredible Manager and a truly good human being.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
As a Liverpool fan and I'm not gonna lie, thishurts more than the Slip,Crystanbul,theHodgson era, the 6-1 loss vs Stoke, the JohnStones goal line clearance, City's comebackvs Villa,Athens 2007,Kiev 2018 and Paris2022 combined Cheers for the memories Jurgen. You deservea well earned rest once everything is said anddone.YWNA
Klop is the sole reason Liverpool being contender again. Thank you for bringing the EPL to us long time Liv fan! YNWA! Hopefully we won't spiral down like what happened to Manu...
At the end of the day, he is human life goes on. Respect his decision and move on.
Im so heartbroken to see him leaving
I am a Chelsea fan but I have massive respect for Klopp. He is an exceptional manager. One of the three best for last decade.
Joh this hurts like hell😢
Not a Liverpool fan but this is sad news but he looks tired even sickly so he needs to look after himself he has given all he has i jist hope he is indeed well health wise.
YNWA.....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love Klop never from Japan 😢
As the guy said 'its a decision he had to take' so total respect. Jurgen, you have gave my club its identity and I will be forever greatful for your time, energy and enthusiasm in everything you did for us. Sir, YNWA and thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Absolutely devastated. Honestly feel like crying. You've given me and so many others so many happy memories and inspiration. If its the right thing for you and your family we all support you and wish you the best Jurgen...but most of all: Thankyou YNWA
heartbreak
Nooooo.  Noooo😢
Pep guardiola will do the same next season
Mourinho to LFC
This man means everything to me. Thank you  klopp I love you. Thank you for everything 😭😭   Am deeply crying 😭😭
😭💔💔💔😭
We’re going to win the league for Jurgen
Thanks Klopp . Every good thing comes to an end, you have done a great and good job for us . Thumbs up.
Thank you Kloop for everything you have done for us! ❤🥲
Been told he has no money to spend .I bet !!!
I remember a comment but by a dortmund  fan in one of the video of jurgen klopp “Enjoy the ride when he is there, u gonna miss it for rest of ur life.” And my god he is correct. I already miss this guy
This is the worse news ever😢😢 Jurgen how can you do this to us. Im from SA and in tears😢😢😢😢
NOOOOOOOO 💔
Will always be a legend, thank you for everything. YNWA.
No man pls don’t leave pls dont
One of the best people managers ever in football. Great manager but above all a great person. Wish him the all the best for the future.   Arne Slot coach from Feyenoord would be a great fit for liverpool, plays entertaining football, has a lot of confidence, is good with players like Klopp himself and he is good with the media as Klopp himself.
What have the owners done
Sad news to hear, but it's just a perfect way to deliver them❤
Next year german national team 😉
클롭 감독님 감사합니다. 사랑합니다. 😢
Thank you, Klopp ... you are the best manager , that liverpool has ever had ❤
Klopp to Newcastle
Klopp‘s dedication has always been second to none. Living the moment 100% with all he has to give. Just watch his manners on the sideline during a match. Maybe he followed Yoda‘s advice „Do, or do not. There is no try“. Good luck for the future dear Jürgen! Maybe you‘ll come back to Germany 🇩🇪
Endless love and respect for everything you have done for us in the Liverpool family!!!! Just remember that YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE JURGEN!! Again, HUUUGGEE LOVE, RESPECT AND WISHES FROM ICELAND ❤❤❤❤❤ Ps. As a person who has had a burnout at work, I totally back his decision because that is a horrible thing. ❤❤❤
Jurgen, please don't go.  What can we do to help you?   Give you a break?  More help?  Please let's see what we can do to improve your life?   If this is your decision, then I respect it ... and have to say a heartfelt thank you.  What you have done to uplift millions of lives all over the world is incredible.  What you have achieved is amazing.  You are so appreciated and you will always be welcome back.   Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I am very sad and sorry to see you leave.
Its heartbreaking but a very wise decision in my opinion.  He has delivered all he could with a limited budget and he will forever be remembered as the best🥰  I always thought Jurgen needs to take a break of 2 consecutive seasons atleast.
SOBBING , woke up and this was the first thing i seen this is so sad
Legend
You're not winning this league. Cmon City  Also im hoping Pep remains a footballing fiend for as long as he healthily can.
Liverpool in my blood
Damn this hurts 😢 Dear supporters. On Jürgens last home game, please give this man the biggest tifo ever made in the history of football! He deserves it! Y.N.W.A ❤
Best thing that happened to this club in my 36 years on the planet. Thank you for everything Jurgen, you’re a real one of a kind human and once the seasons over I hope life leads to a place where you’ll be happy. YNWA
You can really  see he's is drained  both emotionally  and physically, wish him all the best of  health wise,he gave us everything what more can we ask of him
He start fine, he finished with fine way… hat off.. thx u boss.. 🫡
To say I’m gutted is an understatement..they say no one man is bigger than the club..their are a few managers who came close and jurgen is up their with our most legendary managers..we will love him forever and he will be forever a red..thank you sooo much jurgen for all of your hard work dedication and personal sacrifice..I trust every decision you make and although this is heartbreaking I trust you know what is best
didnt he just bought a brand new squad? what is going on?
No.
As a Chelsea fan, Kloop has earned more than my respect... However painful, it's best to leave when the ovation is high... Wish Liverpool the last premier League trophy under Kloop... The premier League will miss you Sir
I was keeping it together until he mentioned Dáire. This is what Jürgen is to us. He knows this club, he understands the passion and the history. I've said it from the start, I'll back Jürgen until the day he goes and it's so bittersweet that it's months away not years. YWNA Jürgen, thank you is not enough!
No No No No No No💔💔💔💔💔😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔 ผมพิมพ์อังกฤษไม่เป็น แต่คุณคือความหวัง คุณคือสิ่งที่ทำให้ผมมีชีวิตอยู่ต่อ ในวันที่ผมคิดจะจากโลกนี้ไป ผมอยากเชียร์สโมสรลิเวอร์พูล ที่มีคุณคุมทีมอยู่ ในวันนี้ผมเศร้ามากๆ ผมรู้ต้องมีวันนี้ แต่มันเร็วเกินไป ผมเสียใจมากๆที่เห็นข่าวในวันนี้
Gutted. Much respect Mr Klopp. Liverpool legend.
Kloppo bitte bitte bitte komm zurück zum BVB, die Mannschaft, der Verein, die Fans ergo die Familie braucht dich dringender denn je
Oh man. I understand how he feels. This happened to me at my old job. I felt so burnt out and wanted to experience life or something different because it was so intense. Ynwa Jurgen. Let’s finish this season with a bang and a lovely farewell ❤
OMG don't leave us my coach, my manager.
no way
I feel like someone died. An era like no other in recent memory. The only "stain" on it is the rampant corruption that didn't allow him to win so much more in England. YNWA Jürgen, forever a Red legend.
I am not even a liverpool fan, and I am shocked and emotional. Klop is one of the best
Jurgen ..we Will never forget you..YNWA...
This is so good to my ears😂😂😂😂😂
I am devastated. We need to build him a statue. FSGOUT
Concerning that Liverpool without Klopp will be a mid table Team with the current owners.
All the way from Ethiopia...just thank you for everything ❤❤❤
This is heart breaking 💔 😢  the love and bond we have developed towards the manager is massive. We thank you 😊 🙏  and we love you . Wish you all the best in whatever you do.
Major Brainfog!!
💔💔💔
😭😭😭 Thank you for everything Sir. It hurts me as much as when Steven Gerrard left the club. It will be difficult to find someone who so embodied the soul of Liverpool! Good luck "normal guy"
Watched the whole thing and I'm an Arsenal fan. Shows the respect myself and other fans have for him. Will be sad to see him go
XABI ALONSO INCOMING.......😂
😭🥺
الملهم ❤❤❤
l love yuo..what ever you do
like many of the people leaving messages here, am not a liverpool fan but i have all the respect to klopp. hope one day on a beach or a street in some country, i have the chance to run into him and shake his hand. he is what every man should strive to be. good luck.
YNWA
Proper legend. Will never forget how he dragged an injury plagued squad to top four for more than 1 season having been ruled out of top 4 by December! Proper proper manager
Time to get his statue up
Klopp you're a legend and thank you so much from the deepest part of my heart! You stayed to build 2.0 and not leave us in a bad state even when you was already running low on energy! ❤️ Thank you for winning us number 19 and ending the soul destroying long wait! You will always be cherished and part of the LFC family, so sad but as you say - please accept and it's difficult to but it makes sense with your explanations. YNWA boss
It‘s just a Coach, nothing special about it. And like every player every Coach is replaceable too. So that‘s it.
Please don't leave klopp. It will take a long time to find someone like u. Ur passion, ur love, ur character, ur fatherly support. Ur celebration with the fans. The three punch😂😂😂 after a good game. Ur are such an amazing man. An amazing person. Not just a good coach but a good person. Love u so much. U will never walk alone
To all the Liverpool fans thst laught and mocked us for the last 10 years after Sir Alex left us, CRY MORE. 😅😅😅
Thank you for everything 😢😢😢 I love you ขอบคุณ​ครับ​ ผมจะจดจำคุณจนกว่าจะหมดลมหายใจ
I literally felt like somebody had died when I seen this
Forever in our hearts nomatter where he goes.
We all knew the day would come, but surprised Right now. But what a Story, what a Coach. I am a Bit sad but unterstand his decision. Best way to comunicate a tough decision. Biggest respect to THE SPECIAL ONE. He came as the normal one and gave us something Special ❤
This is so painful and shocking no matter where Jurgen will go he will always be Liverpool in my heart ❤❤❤
He wants to be Germany Manager and win a 5th World Cup with the most successful International team in Europe! Welcome home Boss!
wishing you peace and blessings for your future. Jürgen Klopp is the best to ever do it and you'll be missed 🙏🏽Thank you for everything you've done for the club. ynwa❤️
Where is the cap ?💔
This hurts a lot. I can only imagine how much this hurts the players
We will always ❤ you for what you done so far and are doing  this season for Liverpool football club. YNWA❤️
Xabi Alonso end of season?
I believe the real reason behind this all, is that Mo Salah is going to leave the club in summer. He is the key player in the system, he is involved in every offensive s situation without him it will be a major set back for Liverpool...
What a shock!  Thank You JK “The best manager of all “
May yoy go with love and peace in your heart and mind ,. Thankyou for your dedication ,love and hard work for our club and city,god bless you and your family ❤
Arsenal fan - WOW. Big loss, definitely one of the premier league greats - up there with Fergie, Wenger, Pep & Mourinho. Number 4 of top 5 P.L managers so far.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Best manager in the premier league right now. This feels so painful and it hasn’t even sunk in properly for me yet! I don’t think it’s possible to sun up how much this man means to Liverpool fans, those at the club, the city and also wider football community. Absolutely gutted but we have to back him and his decision. Love him to bits and will mourn the future memories beyond this season that we won’t have with him. The best football I’ve seen and best feelings I’ve had as a Liverpool fan. Thank you Jurgen! ❤ I’ll be in the crowd at whatever open top bus parade we have at the end of this season to say my thanks 😢
Jurgen is one of the best that there is.  He will be always a part of the Reds & YNWA.  He brought the best out of the team & inspiring to every one in Liverpool.  I am half way across the world & love what he can do.  Best wishes & all the best for his future after the end of this season.  We will have you with us as Liverpool supporters all over the world.  ❤ from Malaysia.
Danke Jurgen, lets make this a memorable season
Klopp forever  Love you  u are the best
A revolving change ???? Klopp <-> Nagelsmann ??
Don’t be sad that it’s over, be happy that it happened
Not a shock, knew it was coming eventually. An icon, a legend and forever a red. A manager that supported our women and helped push for the club to give them everything they need. A manager who pushed for social programs change and gave the right messages. A manager that equaled Bill Shankly’s record of 7 titles. The third manager alongside Vic Akers and Sir Alex Furgeson to win all the major titles available, the first Liverpool manager to do so. I can see him going to international football either with Germany men or women. Either that or he’ll be a head of FA or be a campaigner for social progressive change in football. YNWA Jurgen 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
This man is full of class, right until the very end
Thank you, Jürgen!
I had just started to watch football again abt 2yrs ago n immediately fell in love w the club n the way they play, most of that thnx to Jürgen. Thank u Jürgen for making this club just that little bit more special even for just a little while. YNWA❤
Thanks for everything Jurgen. YNWA ❤
Well, that’s classy.
I'm not jealous of anything Liverpool as an Evertonian. I was jealous when Klopp came in though. I'm gutted he is leaving the prem. He cracks me up and is a great character. The things he says, but also the stuff he did in the community which made me laugh many times. Sad day for the Premiership!
No 😭😭😭😭
Seems he feels the need to go on with new challenges!  This one he's done very well!
Klopp get some rest and come back Boss, You are one of best Managers in the world, Liverpool F.C will never bee the same again. I can't make peace that you leaving us. YNWA
Massive loss for Liverpool.  He's burnt out and had to walk away after building something incredible.  He will be missed!
ETH vs Pep the next rivalry 🔥🔥🔥
this is a joke right?!
Jurgen Klopp deserves to have a statue or some other form of lasting commemoration for what he has been to the Liverpool Football Club and fans. One of football's elite managers!!
😢
Stuffed up my day :( Love this bloke!!
Bring xabi alonso
Barcalona or real madrid bound
i’ve never been more crushed. we love you jurgen! ykwa
💔
Where will klopp might go??? I will follow him wherever he will go
One of the most listenable and charismatic managers in   world football !!!
Wow, what an interview! 😮
Oh that's sooo sad.  But when he's really running out of energy, gentle to prevent damages to the club during the next season...
No matter what... You're always in our heart Boss... YNWA😢😢😢
What an incredible interview. He really explained it well. Not even a liverpool fan but I am getting emotional here. What a man. Incredible monologues from him. So eloquent
As italian supporter of AC MILAN , I can only say Klopp is the best manager on the scene of the last 20 years . Mainz still remeber him , Dortmund still acclaim him, Liverpool will never forget him . Everywhere he worked he left a better team and a better atmosphere : only him , not even Pep , not even Mou , not Ancelotti and Conte ... Respect
One of the best managers of all time. Knew this day would come but I didn't expect it to have such an impact
كان المفروض ياخرون الإعلان حتى نهاية الموسم
so u just gon leave us?????
😢What a man what a human being what a liverpool manager ❤️ Y.N.W.A Jurgen
sad day for all liverpool fans  thankyou so much sir for everyting YNWA
It's not just what he's done for Liverpool, but forthe league as a whole. He has brought energy and excitement to the league, and he deserves the very best of sendoffs👏🏾
LOOOOOOOL LOOOL LOOL LOOOL LOOOOOOL OMG LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOLLLLLL BROOOO WHERE ARE THE LIVERPOOL FANS AT????? YALL TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT KLOPP NOW HE GONNA LEAVE LOOOOL YALL SO SCREWED NOW!!!!! HE COULDN'T HANDLE PEP! Respect to Klopp but this is just so funny.  I am not making fun of Klopp. It is just funny how Liverpool fans keep talking big about Klopp and he is leaving so they won't be able to say that anymore.
You would think liverpool fc channel would know to use microphone, everytime I co e to this channel the volume is none existent. Need a massive speaker to hear it, even got to the point I went and had hearing tested to make sure it wasnt me. Bye klopp sad day for every liverpool fan.
Thank you for everything, even for the broken hearts of 2022 season.. you lifted us up with sheer hope and determination, with passion and love, all without backing of cash piles. What an exhilarating time it was to be an LFC fan, even now the Europa league final of 2016 looks fresh, like a beginning of a new day. 😒😒😐😔
Thank you for bringing happiness around the globe, being a role model for kids AND adults and for showing us what it means to be THE "normal one" ❤ so many good memories! Again, thanks for everything ❤ YNWA
17:35 He will work again but not for the next 1 year. He said he cannot sit around.  First he said he doesn’t have enough energy and wants to need a normal life.  These are contradictions. He could’ve told the owners that he want so take a break. I am sure the club would’ve worked something out. is there something wrong in the environment at LFC? Is he tired of that?   Plus the whole assistant coaching staff is leaving too. Why are they all leaving together?
ya such sad announcement but all with due respect one of the greatest ever from his personality to all his playing tactics you will be missed by all us liverpool so much respect for your and prety sure your family too are with you and we so much respect you decision farewell boss👏👏
Vielen Dank für Alles, Jürgen!
as a football fan, thank you Jürgen Klopp for everything you have done, you're one of the greatest 🥹
.the longest, the greatest, the biggest...the richest...and????
Making us skint since 2015
Icon, devastating news.
😢😢😢 im literally crying.!!!   I can't believe this!!!! But when someone mentions health, there's nothing one could argue.
Vielen danke, Jurgen!!!
😢
I would run through a brick wall for you <3 Thank you for everything!
What a sad day😢
Bill shankly to Jurgen....a true manager
Gonna Miss Him don't know who will replace him it's shocking all the best Jürgen :(   😰
I understand but I'm still heart broken, best of luck, you will be missed and You'll Never Walk Alone
The Myth, the Legend. Forever Immortalised, Jurgen.
As a city fan i always utterly dreaded playing liverpool with klopp as the manager. Knowing we could get an absolute battering at any point. Seen some brilliant intense games and that comes from the passion of both managers. All the best for the future
😢😢😢😢😢😢
Thank you Klopp! For bringing so much joy to Liverpool FC
The normal one became an exceptional one. Great manager with the courage to end things at the right point of time for him. He built a legacy.
HERO..😢 AM SADDEN. BUT  Grateful❤.."Tru the years"😢. By kenny Rogers now top of my play list😢
The unexpected things happen in football as in life. As life, we will try to move on but we won't forget these amazing moments with Klopp. You wil be always in our hearts.❤ YNWA
どうも有難うございました、クロップさん🙇‍♂  ＹＮＷＡ
It's completely understandable and in an ideal world we should all be able to make time for ourselves to recharge and truly enjoy what life is supposed to be. I know I need it right now.  What a manager, but more importantly what a man. A huge loss to not only Liverpool, but the country as a whole. Jurgen deserves nothing but peace and happiness.
You deserve the rest, gaffa.
Klopp will be the next manager of the brazilian national team
20 years of misery incoming
The players will fight for the Premier league just to dedicate it to Jurgen 😢
We are indeed blessed for so long to have Jurgen at the helm. Truly shocked and sad, but I have nothing but respect and gratitude for this man. Thank you, thank you, thank you.. from the bottom of my heart..
Waaaah, uncle Klopp. Please don't go man, there's nobody that can take your place. 😭
I can't watch all of this, he has his reasons and it's his decision to make. All I need today is to have heard him speak those sad sad words for confirmation.  My only job now is the only role Ive ever had as a supporter and thats simply to get right behind Jurgen n the team n support them as loud and as proudly as I can.   Who knows what the future will bring. Thats not for me to decide. But with tears in my eyes, its not yet time to say Goodbye.   We're in the mix for 4 trophies this season, thats my focus. We'll say a sad farewell in May regardless how the season ends. Nothing but love.   C'mon redmen, lets give him the best send off possible!!
I’m a Man United fan, but this news is dejecting. It comes with mixed emotions from us, but I can imagine how it feels for Liverpool fans. The team he gathered to compete at the level they did was just incredible! I respect the club and Klopp.   Best of luck!
Legend made us liverpool fans believe again YNWA jurgen ❤
This is heartbreaking news but we should all remember that Jürgen has achieved more than we ever thought possible for our club, he kept all his promises and is leaving us with the club back in its rightful place, at the Top of English football. He will forever be a Liverpool Legend, now get sculpting that Statue and boys, get on with winning this quadruple for Jürgen ❤
vem ser auxiliar do Palmeiras Klopp, você e o abel vão se dar muito bem no verdão!
We all at LFC owe you everything Jürgen 😢 I hope these boys win you the prem!! Not for the the fan for YOU!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ We love you
I am genuinely sad about this news,  but all i help to say is Thank you Jurgen from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Even tho as a rival fan, klopp has transformed Liverpool and made them back to what they were in the 80s a title challenging team gl to what ever he goes to
I hope he comes back to dortmund ,....that's sad ❤❤❤
5 stages of grief... 1. Denial - No way, it's BS... This interview confirms it. Nooooooo... 2. Anger - It's the 'owners' fault. If they'd backed him then less stress means he'd stay much longer... FACT. 3. Bargaining - make him director of football! He can guide Xabi. 4. Depression - Are we gonna be the new man u? 5. Acceptance - not sure I can do that. I'm devastated. Love the man. What an incredible human being. I know how much I owe the man.
Klopp ❤
Legend
We will miss you Klop, it's really shock and sad. The smiling man, the humble one, what's a manager. Tq so much
Over 6000 comments within one hour. This says everything.
Called himself "The Normal One" but proved he is "The Only One". ❤
Real Madrid come get the legend...when ancelotti leaves...
klopp goes beyond liverpool as a manager. Klopp made me laugh, made me cry. he will always be my favorite manager. we love you Klopp. LETS BRING HOME THE QUAD
Barca comeback, first premier League in 30 years, great memories all the best for the future Kloop
As a united fan, i am glad he leaving, he was involved in some of our historically worse defeats.
As a united fan, sorry to see a loss of greatest manager I have seen in my life. Sorry to lose him at premier league. And he was full of energy, enthusiastic and respectful. Whatever decision made, I want to give him applause with respect. Thanks for being a great manager for rival team. The competition could not have been better without you.
I get and respect it. Man, i'm going to miss him, the vibe and the backroom staff. I don't know what to say... YNWA
Don’t get angry at me comments plss I am a Man United, Real Madrid Fan and I have huge respect to kloop although you beat us 7-0 that is the only thing I hate him but all the time the only rivalry manger I have respect to I don’t have respect to pep xavi pot chels, pot spurs, simm altico and mikal artea but I have respect to klopp although I am a Man U fan and a Real Madrid fan and a AC Milan Fan this is very sad and I hope he does good for his next job or if he retires as a manger whatever I hope this legend has a good life and have a good life and good Luke kloop the best manger in prem history
The Premier League will be worse off without him. He is is a hard act to follow…
Lazy!
Thanks so the Rumours have been true ,you will be joining Bayern Munich next season 👍
Feeling very sad
Very sad to hear from our big boss had to leave at the end of this season..Anyway we are loyal fans, hope the best good luck to Jurgen Klopp..Most important is the next appointment manager must be real deal 🙏🏻
😭😭😭😭
Never thought a manager leaving would hurt so much.  Would support Liverpool FC forever but this void can't be filled. He is irreplaceable. Danke! Jurgen Norbert Klopp To all the supporters who can go to Anfield, please give your all for the rest of the matches. YNWA!
Shocked but wish klopp all the best, greatest Liverpool manager of my lifetime. Hope the club get it right with his replacement so we stay at the top and not go back to our old ways
He has done everything achievable for the club!  Being a smart, reasonable and compassionate individual, he knows a thing or 2 about life. He's not being selfish, it's about his family, health and as he stated energy.. Football aside, I actually think he can achieve even greater success OFF the pitch, that's how much respect I have for this man.  Chelsea fan here.
💔 😭
Legend build the statue now
Curbing my expectations for next season. This man turbocharged the past 9 years due to his tactics and personality. The most important signing the club made in my lifetime, genuinely sad he's leaving. Thank you Jurgen !!
Jürgen Norbert Klopp ❤
Jurgen you brought light when it was very dark, you brought hope when there was despair. You mean more to us than football. You will be missed, but you'll ALWAYS have a home at Liverpool. YNWA
And also, is Xabi Alonso watching??
❤❤❤😢😢
Good luck boss good luck brother you of regents 😮😢😂
😢😢
Best manager we got❤❤since I supported liverpool❤
The worst news for this season for a Liverpool fans, Hope the boys will be able to win 1 more title for Klopp
😢😢😢😢😢😢
I’m a Celebrity 2024 contestant
When you’ve run 100 miles flat out you can sprint finish with the last part of your entire body and entire essence. But if someone said there is another 100 miles to go, you would fold almost immediately. It makes total sense and good luck to a great man
Made dreams come true, did the impossible my manager what a journey lets make history in the final few months.
As an arsenal fan ,i truly respect Klopp since day 1 he came premier league
😭💔
He will always be the best of us. I have been a red since 1969, my heart is broken, but I have so much love and admiration for this man - we have been so lucky to have him as our gaffer. I hope he has the best "normal life" there is. Good luck my friend and thank you x
i love you, klopp.
Thank you for everything boss
Thats very sad. As I German I became Liverpool Fan because of Klopp and watch since then nearly every game.
For all you have done for the club a very big thankyou. Wishing you and your family all the best for the future, and do come back every now and then, you will always be welcome at Anfield and Liverpool. Take care out there Jurgen YNWA.
I love you man but my heart is broken
They need to win the league for him now, Anfield will be bouncing. Thank you Jurgen.
😭
Jurgen will forever be remembered as the best, most pationate and most influential manager Liverpool has ever and will ever have.  We love you klopp! ❤
Devasted, speechless, we still see that first interview that he gave.  Those iconic words Of how "you go out"  It's come true, what a send out.  We will win for you now. Come on Anfield
I will always love Liverpool. Klopp was great 👍❤ but I understand he's got no energy, it's stressful😢
Klopp does not abandon the ship when it is sinking like other coaches, but when he takes it to the best port. Thank you so much! You deserve a statue too.
"I'm so glad that Jurgen is a red"
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
New this day was coming but it’s another sad day in the history of this fantastic club he set the foundations like the great managers before him we love him and remember the good times and the bad but we are Liverpool football club and that means more ❤❤❤❤❤❤YNWA
Danke jurgen 💔
👑
the man who turned our club around, you are a godsend to Liverpool and continue to prove your worth to us. good luck you legend
💔💔💔💔💔😔😔😔😔😔
Not a Liverpool fan but still sad to see this. Big loss to the prem. At the same time, you could see something was missing at the end of last season. I would like to see him leave with one more league title. Good luck to him. Can see him as the next Germany manager, I know that was the rumour.
King 👑
take a rest Boss!
I'm devastated
Gutting 😢
Build a statue of him.
He's going to Saudi
YNWA KLOPP
omg boss ㅜㅜ😢 Thank you for your service❤
What an absolute legend. Nobody will ever forget the impact you've had not only at Liverpool in the lives of it's players, staff and fans, but also for football as a whole. Thank you for all the brilliant years you spent at the helm. Although it saddens me to see you go, I totally respect that you can only go full-tilt right at the top for so many years until you need to rest and enjoy life at a different pace. YNWA <3
Klopp you are too modest. We will see you off with three fist pumps and tears of sorrow and joy for you in our eyes. Enjoy your life my friend and stay in good health. Thank you for everything.
He’ll be back 💪🏻 love you lad ❤️
Thank you for your service. Thank you for all the beautiful memories. Your magnificence will last forever. Thank you.
😮😳😳🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🥲..my heart is racing a million miles because of the shock. He's an intelligent man, a brilliant one...he knows what he's doing. I think that the dream is over. Thank you for that amazing dream!...to live and relive championships years, 9 finals and...maybe more this year👏🏾. And if it wasn't for City and an era of billions of dollars running a club we would've won lots of Trophies more...so thank you🙇🏾‍♂️
I only started watching football from 2017-18 season. Since the start, I have always supported Liverpool. Rarely ever missed a matchday. Jurgen and all players practically my family now. I just can't stop crying 😭
We LOVE ❤ you KLOOP !!!! YNWA !  Much LOVE From MALAYSIA ❤
Best manager in the league by far best we have had since bill shankly lol xx
Klopp, I love you forever. You make me happy as I being superliverpool. I love you, and Thank you. I never forget your all of things.
I'm  feeling sad with this decision😢😢
Why announce this now?
What a healthy message! Never need to apologize for putting your needs first before the ones of the many! So grateful of this man's contribution to the club and to football overall. What a great role model to the so many people around the globe who look up to him. Thank you Jürgen Klopp ❤
I'm not even a football fan at all, but even I am sad about this. Great human being, who deserves a break.
Please stay in Liverpool 😢
I know this isn’t about any other manager, but it shows how fecking good Sir Alex was to do it for 26 years at the top of the table. Jurgen wants a rest as he is knackered. He’s been here 9 years, it’s unreal the stress these guys must go through to keep the side at the top of their game. Other managers can bounce around for 25 years but they don’t have the desire to be at the top like these Elite managers have. Unreal innings for Jurgen turned Liverpool from what Man Utd is now to the top 3 side in world football. 👏🏼.
I've been Liverpool supporters since 40 years ago, the only one club I love it in my life, I'm fortunate to see one of the amazing club manager with his passion, we gonna miss you klopo
What an amazing man and a leader ❤ I am so glad that I managed to realize a lifelong dream in 2023 and come with my son and see Liverpool play at Anfield under Klopps management.  Something I will cherish for the rest of my life!
Wish you the bestr of lucks now and always, thanks for everything you did and the fire your brought back to the club. YNWA!
Fairplay to Jurgen we all knew this had to happen and the integrity of the man is to make sure we have enough time to get our house in order such is his love of the club. Pepe steps up the old boot room coming back or Xavi Alonso  🤔whatever happens next Jurgen is a RED thank you and Fairplay 😢👍
The greatest manager of all time
Omg I a shedding tears I was born in Portsmouth in 1971 but at 6 years I had Kenny dalgleish on my wall so I knew Liverpool was my team . So much to say all I wish jurgen all the best for him and family and wish him best x  Jason from Romford Essex
Bye Jurgen I love you❤❤❤❤
Shankly, Paisley, Fagan, Moran, Dalglish, Evans, Houlier, Benitez, Klopp.......
😭💔
More than the trophies or the success thank you Jurgen for being a great person. Proud to have you as our manager
bvb is waiting for you to come back!
Entrena al barca y hazlo crecer 😢
Let's win it all. Up the Reds.
Who else would have mentioned a young fan named Daire in his retire-speach. YNWA
I love you, thank you ❤❤❤😊
I fukcing love this guy since he was in dortmund and I will love him till my last day. He's just so honest in emotions and words. And his trainer skills are just unbelievable ❤
Please give him a statue for the fams 😢
Thank you for your service. Absolute legend, took us from mediocrity and misery to Triumph and jubilation.
Amazing Manager - Man City's dubious accounting robbed him of at least 2 more Premier League wins.
i wanna be in this comments because this vid with this legend would be on fire
Please,  everyone in the LFC give 100% support to Klopp. To make LFC Champion once again to end a glorious era and to start a bright future.
NO
i thought i was prepared for this news but it still hurts😢 thank you so much jurgen for all these years and we will respect your decision to move on and YNWA❤
No wayy((( klopp always be liverpool legend❤
Y.N.W.A🔴⚪️🔴❤️❤️💪🏽💪🏽
In Klopp we believe....hes the one who made us beleive in this club again. He guide back to the top. Thnaks a lot KLOPP❤ You'll Never Walk Alone❤
😢
Its actually good that he is leaving like this, on his own accord. He deserves it, would have been digusting if after a bad run of form, he got sacked. How ideal would it be if he brought another league title in his last season? Not many leave or even have the chance to leave like that.
Loved his passion for the club but his integrity was truly felt. You can’t buy integrity.  YNWA
I supported Liverpool because of you , This man in every press conference gave me indirect lessons about life about work , I will bloody miss you , I learned from you how to accept the situations that I go through in my life and  how can I bring the best results from the most difficult issue , I learned from you how to be loyal and committed to my job what ever it was , I know that this is your decision but we didn't expect it , this is the saddest day in my life actually ,  but I wish you to be happy in your life , thanks a lot Mr. Jürgen I am your biggest fan from Egypt and finally you will never walk alone we are with you. ❤
Just gutted this morning. Absolutely gutted.
We will miss u boss. Thank u for everything.  “KLOPP FOR KOP”
You can keep your Fergursons, your Peps,  your Mourinhos I'll always be a Klopite!!   World class coach but more than that a world class human being.   ❤️🇿🇦
Thank God. I can return to anfield once thus dictator is out
I just don’t know what to say 😞 😡  😤 !! Imagine woken up in the morning & picking up your phone to check & the first thing you see is this news
As a Man Utd fan, my sympathies are with Liverpool right now. You rightly love him, he's a great manager. I wish him all the best.
Just like Shanks  he made the people happy
Over rated ,, under achieved
Not a liverpool fan but my god what a world class man and manager klopp is.. good luck to him in the future and he finds what he is looking for
Im man u fans but this is sad😢
This will go down in history🫡
I wanna cry😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 Plz  don't  leav
Klopp knows he can't really compete with CHEATS man city and nothing being done about it. That's probably one of the reasons he's leaving
Could hold back my tears
Reading the comments here from fans everywhere, no malice, no stupidity. Everyone recognises greatness. This morning, I woke up feeling happy, then I heard this and I'm not gonna lie I have a dry throat and damp eyes. But I am so happy for him that he can leave like this, no one deserves it more. You can see him, he knows how much he means to Liverpool FC, the Fans, The Premier League and the world. But he is still humble enough to ask himself why the people see him like this: It's because you ask yourself this, the passion you show and the happiness you have brought back to Liverpool FC Fans.  Wir werden dich vermissen. but until the end of the season, you are still our Klopp.  Family is what you make it. Thankyou Boss and good Travels, wherever you go, you go with our thanks. YNWA
ㅠㅠ
Klopp please don't leave us reconsider I love you so much just the way you took us from Loserpool to competiting for titles is incredible I beg please reconsider
I'm a bayern fan but this news is really sad and I wish him all the best after the season
Wish this was just First of April!! 😥
Gutted. From a Sunderland fan
Noooo what a bummer, good luck to him, he's given us so much and no hard feelings towards him for this. Just hope now that he's helped bring us to where we are that we don't turn into a man utd
I am as sad as I can be to hear that, we will surely miss this LEGEND at Liverpool FC.. But I am 100% convinced that he did it out of his huge respect and love for the club and for the fans❤
I’m a Manchester United Fan who absolutely loves Klopp, mainly for his love of the game , but also for how he loves all players, not just his own…I’ve seen this coming for a while now, he looked tired sometimes during games and I said to my partner who’s a huge Liverpool fan that I think he will leave soon,  he’s most certainly a legend and will forever be Liverpool like he says… it’s sad news but he deserves to go and relax and enjoy the life he’s worked so hard for.  You will be missed immensely, Thank you for being the best you could be for the longest time… ❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢
Graced us,thanks.
Thank you Klopp! You will always be loved here in Liverpool ❤❤❤
As a city fan I like liverpool That's a shocker now who's gonna replace him? He should have waited until this season
Sad to see him go, will be quite a challenge to find anyone close to him...
EMOTIONAL 😢..THANKS FOR THE WONDERFUL MEMORIES BOSS...YNWA
Today I am The Sad One
Kloop is best manager in liverpool I love Liverpool since i was 3 years old,Kloop gave everything for this club Kloop we love you,YNWA
I beg for Liverpool to sign Mourinho after Klopps farewell, but I will miss Klopp the most. Half my life he's been at Liverpool and i really appreciate him being my childhood team manager farewell.
100% next germany coach
Your statue will be built in anfield and the street of liverpool and will always be remembered by the club and fans as the geeatest manager of all time in liverpool and the world. Thank you jurgen klop wish you the best in life.
Xabi Alonso inbound
Dont leave Klopp stay! STAY please I WANT you to stay forever!
everton fan here, even tho we are arch enemies, i love jurgen and i hate to see him go after such a great career with liverpool. he will be missed by not only liverpool, but everyone.
The first Liverpool manager I remember might be Brendan Rodgers. But the first man who made me realize what a manager is was Mr. Jurgen Klopp. Those antiques, fist pumps at the away end, Klopp hugs, press, and infamous excuses have all been a treat. As Carra said, "This news was always going to be a body blow to the club whenever it came. I just thought it would be another few years away."  From delivering the 1st premier league trophy in 30 years to winning our 6th UCL title, from becoming champions of the world to winning every possible trophy in English football, having Jurgen lead us was a boon. He has been a serial winner. Truthfully, I had expected him to at least outlive his current contract. My heart was in smithereens when the news was broken this afternoon. Like I had been punched in my stomach.   Filling in his boots will be a very difficult job for whoever is going to replace him. Still, I would sincerely like to thank Jurgen for the fondest footballing memories I have.  For the last few times before he's gone " I'm so glad that Jurgen is a Red"  YNWA, Jurgen.
Your time at the club will always be cherished 🫶🏾
Let's cherish this and do the QUAD for Klopp
Gutted as a spurs fan to hear him leaving the prem. It seems like it's a health issue by the sounds of it, either that or the owners are in some trouble. Be interesting if alonso will be the next manager. It'll be a great replacement in perfect time if he wins the league.
Thank you kuryen Klopp 😢
Maybe he is drunk
I witnessed the glory with Paisley. Klopp is unique and not to be compared. But he prolonged the same spirit. God bless you Jurgen!
Wow, this is a shocker! As a Spurs fan, I at one time really wanted Klopp to join us after Dortmund, but was happy none the less that he was bringing his style of football to the EPL. It's been remarkable watching him build some formidable Liverpool teams, and if not for Pep and the ludicrous amounts of money Citeh have thrown at players, I'm sure Klopp would have had a few more trophies to his name. One of the finest tacticians and in-game managers in football today, playing exciting and aggressive football, his contributions to the game will not be forgotten.
Noooooooooooooooooo!
“What a guy” “what a manager!” Legend! Sad to see him go 😩
I'm man utd fan and big respect for this man , his love and passion for liverpool was amazing.I still can't believe he's gonna leave this club. Every football fans on this planet will never forget what he did for liverpool , many trophies, greatest winning matches( most entertaining matches ) . Good luck Mr.Klopp u're the living legend and one of the greatest ever mananger of all time sir.                   With best wishes  May god bless you always...
Mr. Klopp has helped LFC win every available trophy. We should not ask for more. I'm his age and I completely understand him wanting to experience the world. The honour was all ours, YNWA Mr. Klopp.
I'm in shock, crying ah i dnknw.....
Breaking news yes wow blow me away jurgen
No !!!!!
It’s cos of the owners and lack of funding
Jurgen... thank you for everything you have done and we will continue to support you to the end, and best wishes and luck for your future - you are a Legend and you will always have our love Go n'éirí an t-ádh leat ☘
People saying it's tactics to get he's players extra motivated. They're top of the league & can still win 4 trophies this year. If they win the league then he might do a U - turn. Just like Sir Alex in 2001 & Ancelotti last year with Real Madrid.
We love you Jurgen! Thanks for the memories ❤
Is next job for Klopp the manager of Germany?
Cant belive this is happning! One of the greatest mangers there is . Lets win the leugue klopp❤️☹️
🥲🥲
So Gutted,  Gonna be a sad day at the end of the season when he leaves 😢
Thank you for enriching our league you will be missed hopefully one day you will choose to come back. From a Utd fan.
Lieber Jürgen, komm zurück zur Borussia.  Ob Du mit uns Meister wirst oder nicht spielt keine Rolle.  Hauptsache Du kommst zurück. Dann wird alles Gut!  Watzke geht, Du kannst Teammanager werden. Das wäre auch toll. Ansonsten macht Tersic sicher gerne Platz und tritt ins zweite Glied zurück.
No matter what I say, I cant express the love, respect and gratitude I have for you boss.. U will be missed.. YNWA❤
Let's finished this season high no matters what happened. Thanks Boss you are best if not one of, thank you for the  EPL, CL, Super Cup, World Cup, FA, League and everything's you had done and achieved together with team/players🔥👏
Always, Legends ❤
As a Man Utd fan, as much as I don't like Liverpool, a huge huge respect for Klopp and what he has done for Liverpool. Brought back the Anfield Fortress! Good Luck Gaffer!!
Rip Liverpool
Love him and his passion. So this is why the club is looking for a docu series vendor
Pep might get bored without you😢.
Simply the Legend.
Build the statue now
The word legend does not do Jurgen Klopp justice. I have never seen a better manager, but that is only part of what JK brings. His pure honesty & integrity are so refreshing.  He will be in our hearts for ever. Thank you.
Take your time to have a good rest n enjoy family life... u will always be amongst the best ... stay safe n healthy.. Mr Klopp tqvm for the memories n now lets win em all!!!
So gutted. Good luck Klopp and thank you for everything YNWA
Thank you for everything you've done here.
Thank you for everything. You have been the best manager in my lifetime.  Hope all the very best for your future.
I can't even bear to like the video 😢 though I can empathise with his decision. I'm numb. Just numb. I hope, Klopp will continue to be a part of LFC in the coming times, ( though I highly doubt it) 😢😢😢 YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE, Klopp. Thanks, for everything 🙏🏾 For the triumphs, the overcoming setbacks as a team, for the jokes, the joy of leading us to victory and creating (and breaking records) for delighting us with pure football.
This breaks my heart so much 😢
You've made Doubters to Believers. You've made us scream In Klopp, We Trust! And with that, you'll be forever in our heart ❤
Wahre Größe
Was not ready for this day YNWA 💔🙏
I must say I'm hurt by him living the Club, but I wish him well. He's a great coach. I wish you well Klopp. Thanks for the amazing achievements .
Wrrrryyyyyyy😭😭😭

From doubters to believers! YNWA Jurgen, love you!
The best time to leave a party is before the fighting starts ... Madrid in the sun

13minutes - Wow does that line hit deep
No klopp I will loose my happy day
He will be missed
Everyone wants a dad like kloop.   He is the man
What about Liverpool 2.0 ?😢
I can't be arsed with a 25min vid. Can someone tell me in one line why he is leaving please?
Jürgen come back home! Go manage SC Freiburg please!
Love Klopp always have and always will !  I  have respect for his decision but with a sad heart, nothing lasts forever and what Klopp has achieved for Liverpool has been nothing short of outstanding he will surely go with love and support from all of us, thank you for so many years and great memories 😢
YNWA❤
No one on this planet has brought me more joy then Jurgen and the team he built, Thank you doesn't cover it, I wish you all the best Jurgen.
He leaves Liverpool in a good state if players stay
Please don’t leave 😢
Forever a red Forever our klopp YNWA ❤
WE GOTTA WIN THE PREMIER LEAGUE THIS YEAR FOR JURGEN!!! I know what he said but we gotta win it for him!!! I'm a 60 year old American who started following soccer in  2018 and fell in love with Liverpool. Jurgen was one of the reasons why!!! With all the other teams that I follow, I've really never felt this emotional about a coach leaving as I do now!!! We will always love you Jurgen. YNWA!!!
Best manager ever
Спасибо, Юрген! Что за великолепное путешествие мы провели вместе!
Build this man a statue please. You made us believe again Jurgen. You Will Never Walk Alone!
I blame Nunez for this.
Danke kloopo
YNWA❤️ Jürgen you’ll probably won’t see this & you don’t know me but you have been a huge part of my life! My wedding is on the 9.9.24 and I‘d love to invite you and your Family!  Let‘s rock this season and end on a high!
Wishing Jurgen all the best. He made me smile during many dark moments in my life, I am forever grateful for his positive energy and enthusiasm on the touch line and what he brought to Liverpool FC.
Just a big, huge, gigantic thank you. For all your hard work and everything youve given to Liverpool FC. The world needs more people like Jurgen Klopp.
Nightmare for boys😢
YWNA. The normal one. Thank you for everything.
Thank you for amazing 9 years. Just thank you, from the bottom of my heart and be safe.
Other than Hillsborough and the Heysel disasters, this is the saddest news in the decades I have been a Liverpool supporter. Thank you for the fantastic memories Sir Jurgen Klopp. Wishing you and your family a Blessed future beyond Liverpool. YNWA 😢😊
"It's not so important what people think when you come in. It's much more important what people feel when you leave." (Jürgen 2015) There is only respect 👏, gratitude 🙏 and love ♥
Much love Klopp, from Malaysia. Gutted you're leaving, damn gaffer
YNWA thank you for everything Jurgen
😢😢😢
Thank you for everything.. nothing last forever
I not okay 😢
🥹
It's over, Liverpool.🥺
Great Manager....I just have a feeling he was scripted by the owners. They did not want to sack him with what he has accomplished for the club so they scripted this for him!. 💔
And that's the end of Liverpool back to fighting for 4th
I am arsenal fan but I like this manager
💔💔💔💔
Is it because lfc are joining the super league shannanigans and he has too much love for the fans 🤔
You broke millions of heart after winning it
From 'Doubters to Believers'. Thanks Jurgen Klopp for helping regain our confidence for the club. You have helps us win every cup available for Liverpool e.g. (Champions League, Premier League etc.), hope we can win the Europa League and Premier League this Season for you. YNWA
So sad to hear you 😮go. Love you ❤🎉and appreciate 🎉what you have been making for Liverpool 🎉🎉
This might just be the darkest day ever at Liverpool F.C. ..it is certainly the darkest day in my life. I love this man.  More than anything... Klopp brought hope to the fans, he changed the way the game is played and rejuvenated the desire and hope needed to become what we are today. My dear Jürgen, this news has devastated me, but, I stand by your choice, I can't accept it right now, and I don't think I ever will, but I respect it.. things will never be the same with you gone..  We all know the owners have forced this decision, but you stood firm.. and they thought you would flinch...they didn't realise who they were messing with.. Jürgen, I am crying my eyes out here, I still can't believe it... YOU WILL BE SERIOUSLY MISSED...YNWA Mr L.F.C. ever
Tearing up 😢, all i can say is Thank You Jurgen ❤❤❤
YNWA Jürgen Liverpool legend thanks for everything ❤❤
Nuremburg. "Being unvaccinated is like not wearing a seat belt". You cost lives!!!
Hariku kemarin sangat bahagia, tbtb klopp kek gini ajg bikin rusak moodku😭
Thanks for everything, but especially for bringing us back this year.  It's been a couple of tough years, but I know all of us love you as a person and a great coach.  Let's finish this year Strong.  YNWA
❤❤❤❤
name the stand after him . The Klopp
THE GREATEST TO EVER DO IT LOVE YOU JURGEN KLOPP
You did your best, Thank you!
Please, it’s heartbreaking
End of an era
create the soul of the team
It makes Roy hodgson sound like he's super human to be managing a team at his age is crazy . Fair play klopp for his honesty.
Madness the club has just died
1 klopp Ynwa boss🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💯
Wonderful news 🤗
💔😭
Heartbreak. 💔
“I can promise I will never manage another club in England than Liverpool” - in these times of endless greed, this really shows character and integrity and shows why he is considered the best.
This hurts…a lot but I understand
A truly sounding gentleman, one of a kind. We shall dearly miss you ❤
liar liar pants on fire.
I cant stop crying after i heard the news it has been such a long jouney thank you for everything YNWA❤😭 Youll always have the chance to come back 🤩❤️‍🔥
He will come back some day, that's for sure. In the meantime rest well boss!❤
I am sad. I’ve shed a tear. But I understand. Thank you.
He is giving everything he has for this club. Like in Dortmund … „Echte Liebe“ … real love is actual a thing for Jürgen, thats why he won‘t coach another EPL team, or Bayern, or PSG … National Team in Germany, maybe. Also the schedule isn‘t that draining and passion he had in Liverpool, Dortmund or Mainz, he would have for Germany… but also for the Three Lions.
This man saved my life. Almost took it, but he gave me hope, little by little every week. Love Jurgen
Respect to a great manager in a way i'll miss him.
We have to sign coach Xabi Alonso
Middlesbrough fan here. I wish you and the family well for the future take care.
I'm so sad to hear that Mr Klop will leave LFC.....
Understand what he stands for. Good luck friend. You have the Liverpool keys. Comeback anytime🫡
He deserves a nice long break. I'd like to see him take a national team job. What a legend this guy is. As a Chelsea fan I always admired his spirit and attitude to the game, he's a class act.   I want Liverpool to win the league as a nice send off to someone who has given so much to them. Either way he'll have an amazing farewell from the Liverpool fans.
ບໍ່ເອົາໜາບໍ່ໄຫ້ໄປ😭😭😭😭
클버지 사랑합니다 그동안 감사했고 앞으로 어떤 길을 가시든 저는 끝까지 응원하겠습니다 I am alwaya surporting u thanks!❤❤
much respect to klopp, goodluck for whatever he does next whether thats retirement or a national team ( which is less stressful than a PL team ).  From a united fan.
Thank you Jürgen for everything you have done for the club and you are a true great manager that we ever had since Shankly n Paisley. YNWA. ❤
Nothing but the biggest respect for you kloppo ♥️♥️♥️🙌🏻  Bleib so wie du bist  Würden uns freuen dich ab 2025 beim dfb sehen 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻♥️♥️♥️
No words can describe how we are all feeling at the moment this guy truly changed our mentality and a bigger impact on us more than just in the game  I will miss you dearly and I respect you and your decision  Massive respect to you and to our club who always respected the fans and gave us all a different proper explanation YNWA❤
I`m a chelsea fan but thats just sad news. Klopp is such a class act and i respect him and what hes done at liverpool a lot. What a legend he is. All the best for you Jürgen. You`ll be missed a lot.
Thanks Jürgen.. thank you for making me fall in love with the most beautifull game..
Let us make the end of your journey in Liverpool exciting. GUYS PLAY FOR THIS MAN AND LET'S GET 4 TITLES, HE DESERVES IT MORE THAN ANYONE. YNWA
Kita siap jadi badut lagi setelah kepergiannya 😢
We will miss you jurgen klop and always remember liverpool is your home and forever in your heart. A legend forever jurgen klop.
Some African presidents should copy from this guy 😢
Thankyou for everything you've done Jurgen. YNWA
💔
Cue the dramatic comments. Like I'm crying, upset etc 😂😂
great speaking jürgen! fully love to you! ❤ you make me cry man!
No,no,no he cannot leave, he is Liverpool FC, he made Liverpool what it is today a club other clubs fear, 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧
I’m not crying it’s just raining
Great manager and have loved watching him work in the PL. glad to see him leave LFC because this will weaken them tremendously. Bye bye Salah as well. He’ll be going this year.
nah this cant be real 😭😭😭😭😭😭
With 0 premier league titles
❤❤❤
Klopp is leaving Liverpool because he knows what is coming to the UK ,war ,hunger and caos !
That is the worst news in the new year. The job that Klopp has done is so great. Thank you Mr. Klopp for everything and wish you good luck in your new beginnings! When you just came to the club in 2015, I knew that Liverpool becomes great again!
Sampai bila bila klopp lagenda liverpool. YNWA
GOING TO BE A GERMAN COACH
This is a sad day for football, not just for liverpool fans. Especially since it might actually be his retirement speech.  Should he decide to ever coach again, i can only see 3 possible scenarios: 1) barca or real 2) returning to help one of his former clubs, mainz or dortmund, that are currently struggling without him  3) coach the german national team.
If there's one person I'd love to have a beer with, it's Jurgen! Such a top bloke. Has done so much for the club and the sport. Always honest and does the right thing.
„Difficult, but the right decision…..“  You made us believe again, enjoy your time ❤️ YNWA
You messed up my day Klopp
What he did for LFC is exceptional. He made us to dream again and dream higher and i want him to leave the club with that EPL trophy in his hand and have a hell of parade in the city of Liverpool I wish you the very best for the future adventures  YNWA THE LEGEND JUERGEN KLOPP❤❤❤
Tons of love from BIGREDS INDONESIA, THANKS BOSS ❤ YNWA
His face is full of disappointment. He's a good coach who's underpaid by his club. He should have been one of the nominees and could have won as one of the greatest Couch in the world.
He made us believe again, and just for that simple thing he will forever be a legend.  all the trophies and everything were beautiful but making us believers again is something i cannot ever thank you enough for jurgen. rest well king, you deserve it
So who will you all be supporting next year? Madrid, Newcastle, man city?
Pool are destined for another three decades of mediocrity
We need xabi , if Klopp leave 😭
Incredible manager thank you klopp. YNWA
😭😭😭
I don't know what kind of pain i feel right now 😢😢😢
Im gonna cry right now...
Brilliant He has done this the best possible way for all involved
Thanks 4 everything
Thanks for your time at Liverpool fc good luck with your future you deserve it ❤️🏐❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ am distraught. A legend who will leave a legacy for generations
Love klopp ❤❤
The problem is: he has to get the German national team back on track
Love you Jurgen❤ thanks for everything😢
We love you klopp!
What a legend he has been for Liverpool top man hope all is well for him amd wish him the best frim a rangers fan
Couldnt care less about PL football as a fan of a team in the national league, but even still this hits different, so sad to see and good luck for whatever you do in the future klopp
Jurgen thank you for your service for liverpool(I'm a bayern fan). Your presence elevated Liverpool into one of the greatest english clubs, if not one of the greatest clubs to exist That being said... can you go to Korea and replace this Klinsmann fella? Please 😢
My heart is broken 😢 but he and his family must come first. I think he will take the German National job as he said no league or  service team for at least 12 months. I respect his decision and respect the man for being honest. He has been a breath of fresh air over the years, and he git us all to believe in his philosophy for the club. We must carry on regardless, as LFC  always does when these things happen.Thank you so much for your faith and service to my beloved club.YNWA .I wish you all the best for the rest of the season and the future.
Barcelona or Madrid in two years time! I’ll say Madrid. Thank you Jurgen we will miss you ❤
Heart is broken. Salute the man for what he has done! Wish him the best and hope to see a statue of him!
The greatest manager we ever got in our history 😢 we'll miss you. YNWA
As a Liverpool, I knew this day would come sooner or later but it hurts now that he just made Liverpool 2.0 and he's leaving. Forever a legend of the game and good luck in the future Boss.
You’ve given us all so many happy memories and we’ve always trusted your judgement, and we’ll trust it this time too. Fingers crossed the season ends well and you can have a fairytale ending just like the rest of your tenure has been a fairytale for us. YNWA
You'll never walk alone Jurgen
You will never walk alone jurgen klop . You are liverpool and forever you will be .
Thank you Klopp, for everything you have done and achieved with our LFC. YNWA you will be missed
Build the amn a status!
Such a classy coach I'm heartbroken 💔
Please, no😢
The best. ❤️😭🧎🏾
I would 100% welcome him at Charlton, see you at The Valley
Klopp you are the best of the best. ❤
Thank you for everything "The normal one" !))  I will watch every remaining match under the leadership of Jurgen with special pleasure
Hope Thiago alcantala remain with your system of coaching 😢
Oh man I’m a Real Madrid fan but this man will be missed one of the best coach’s ever legend
Absolutely gutted and don't want this to happen, but it is, so is it too early to start talking to Xabi? Should focus on that signing more than any player in the next 6 months!
I hope he changes his mind
No please don't ❤❤❤❤YNWA
What a legend!!
Come back to your Heartclub BVB ❤

Devastated, but also incredibly thankful for bring Liverpool FC back to the glory it deserves. Thank you Jurgen.  Now ... is this a pathway for Mr Xavi Alonso?

Great asset is Jurgen Klopp

We need to win the league now for this man!
I miss you man thanks for everythink boss❤😢
Liverpool just lost one of the real human being on the earth.  Rare species in this chaotic time. Grazie Jurgen.
Nobody: Fans of other clubs: i'm faN oF tHis cLuB bUt... You dont have to mention what you are a fan of to honor somebodies work. Why you guys even feel the need to?
💔💔💔💔
As a fan of Manchester United and Tottenham, I sincerely pay homage. Thank you.
No te podemos dar las gracias lo suficiente Jürgen. Eres lo mejor que le ha pasado al club en 30 años❤❤❤❤ YNWA
Absolutely gutted but if thats what he needs ro do rhen he will always have our support
No matter what this end of season entails, I know Jürgen will leave as a Liverpool Legend. Thanks for making us a part of the family
Plz  don't  leave  us klooppppp😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Thank you Jurgen.  YNWA
Thank you Jurgen for an amazing ride. Liverpool 2015 and Liverpool 2024 is night and day. All the best to you and your family for the future ❤
Sad day. Give Pep Ljinders a go. Get back the boot room style.
I am fond of this man's method, point of view and personality. I fell in love with Liverpool because of him. This news is very shocking to me. I respect his decision and choice and it is very bitter for me.  Thank you to Klopp for helping me have beautiful memories. He is a great man and an important person. In this day and age, people like Jürgen are rare... Thank you Jürgen.  I will not forget that I lost a small but very dear dream: to be able to watch the team play at Anfield while Klopp is the head coach. Omid Finland
If there was one man that I could shake hands with and say 'Thank you', it would be Jurgen Klopp..... Thank You for everything you have done for our wonderful club.
i love you boss. You are hero to Liverpool and my life. Since when I was high school to college student now, you were my motivation and energy to me. I respect your passion, skill, dedication and all.   I hope we can meet another time.
Thank you BOSS  You are the best  We will never forget You  Thanks for all
I am egyptian and hope Jurgen  good future whereever goes
This is as bad for the Premier league as it is for LFC. Sad day for English football in general.
Jürgen Klopp is a man of class. He's an excellent role model, because he doesn't think of himself as one. Burn-out is real if you want to call it that. This man is performing a calculated burm-out which seems unprecedented. Love him, and pray for him, who knows when we'll see another gentleman like this. <3
Best manager in my 40 odd years following Pool! Thanks for everything and you have now injected even more intensity and let's all go out on the high that he deserves!  Beautiful way to sign off btw... YNWA❤❤
I think Jurgen is not well and he is hiding it.... The way he mentioned about the limited time left to experience life, loss of energy for future, etc.
I don't care what you say Liverpool fc days are numbered ...doldrums coming
please don't leave us we are not ready 😢
Our hearts will not accept Klopp's departure easily  😭💔
From a legacy standpoint, he is doing the right thing. Passing on a phenomenal team, having done a tremendous job, and likely to win many things this season as well, he's going on a high, with the team in a great position. As a Man United fan, that is all hard to swallow lol.  It is actually a far better position than when Ferguson left because he wasn't allowed to leave a team like this LFC one. Good decision. Look at Wenger etc. They didn't have the luxury of leaving on a high, even though he brought great success. This is wise. Yes, Ferguson left a league winning side and great success, but it was on its way out, so to pass on an amazing young side, having built it yourself, shows something extra.  Well done in advance for winning the league, cup, and Europa treble this season.
..........Speechless
Bring Gerrard Back!
YNWA Boss, always be a legend
As a utd fan I have to admit klopp has been great for Liverpool and will be a big loss to the prem I always wanted us to get him as his style of play is so fun to watch good luck in the future Jürgen
😢 Jurgen, your flair & overwhelming passion for the club will be irreplaceable. YNWA❤️
uhhh last 2 mints....😪
I’m done with this club I’ve loved it my entire life but I’m finished with football it’s not the game I fell in love with I bang carry on without the idea that Klopp is at the top. Ynwa
I didnt see this comming, but I have had a feeling since Bobby, Hendo and Millie left, that changes are comming. You deserve a proper break and if you ever come back to manage I hope we will meet in European football.  Nothing but love and respect for the normal one. Very sad to see you go, but I wish you the best and I hope you find the peace and quiet you need.  Thank you for your hard work. You will be missed. YNWA Jürgen Klopp
Klopp😢
Thank you for all the Memories, Jurgen.YNWA!
His leaving Liverpool because Barca is calling! lol Let’s go Klopp!
I'm a utd fan but he was a great manager
Best manager I’ve ever seen for us just hope he’s feeling alright ❤️ can’t imagine us without him
😢😢😢😢
😢😢😢😢😢😢
❤️❤️❤️
God bless you Mr Klopp ❤
Good bye boss !!!❤  All the best 👍👍👍
I am an Arsenal fan but I came here to show my Respect for Jürgen Klopp he made Liverpool a good club and  won them the Champions League for the first time since 2005 and the Premier League since the 1990(it wasn't called the Premier League back then but it counts) it's such a shame Man City and Real Madrid robbed him of two more Premier League's and two more Champions League's The only thing I can say now is Goodbye Klopp we will miss you
ありがとうクロップ
Top class manager on and off the pitch (unitedfan)
Thanks Klopp... you brought us the best memory of football to Liverpool in recent years and again we will miss u forever!!!
I am an Arsenal and Sheffield united fan...so please don't shoot me. It's been a privilege watching the resurgence of liverpool when he went to the club. Giving the fans lasting memories and molding modern legends in the squad. I wish him and the club nothing but the best. Blessing to have watched from over here in Florida as an American and as a fan of football ingeneral. God bless all!
NOOOOOOOOooooooooooo!!!!!!!! Jurgen PLEEEEEASE DON'T LEAVE US!!!! Have the germans blackmailed him somehow now that Bayern isn't winning bundesliga and German national team sucks? Blackmailed to take away his and his family's passports and take them to Afganistan or sumthing etc? I am crying by the way, 37 yo man.  We Liverpool supporters will always have a special place in our hearts for you Klopp! You took us back to the TOP in the world football after more than ten years of drought and bad decisions and bad campaigns and bad signings. You made us one of the best teams in world football atm. THANK YOU for everything and all the best for the future! And than you for bringing Liverpool FC back to top flight and a title contender every season.  YNWA, You'll always walk with us Jurgen, thank you for your years with us!
Apart from the him saying he is genuinely out of energy there's definitely some additional reason at play and he seemed hesitant to share at this stage. Either ways  what a ride it has been. Hope the last leg of his Anfield journey end with trophies and that we can genuinely part ways on a high. YNWA!
Ask the fans if they are ok?  You owe them that.
Nope💔😭 from 🇮🇳
You will be missed Jurgen....
θελω να σε παρω μια μεγαλη αγκαλια ρε μαλακα
YNWA ❤
Kloppo <3
I can't pull myself together, It wrecked me so hard, I don't know what to say.
I’ve always been a klopp fan, I’m not a Liverpool supporter and when Liverpool supporters said when jurgen first came 😅he’s not the man or manager for the club I said give him time to get his own players and get them to play his way, anyone who did what he did at Dortmund must be a good manager, ps Dortmund are the German team’s results I look for as I worked and lived close to Dortmund , best wishes for the next chapter Jurgen
I WILL MISS KLOOP FIST PUMP .THANKS FOR EVRYTHING YNWA. 💔
For me, he's the best manager of the last decade and Liverpool's rise to becoming dominant in Europe once again was amazing to witness. An incredible leader, innovative tactician (something I think is overlooked with Klopp), and from everything I've seen a great person. As an Albion fan, it's exciting to see where Liverpool go next from the outside - I just hope you don't pinch De Zerbi now! Best of luck, Jurgen :)
6000 comments in the 1st hour
Please dont leave😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The behind the scenes series that Liverpool is negotiating was a big No from Jurgen.  It's a deal breaker
Thanks for everything you did for our club and supporters, not to mention the City we love.  Now the boys need to take this news and make Jurgan's last year truly memorable by doing the jarg Quadruple. Giving a 'like' to this is the hardest thing to do but it's an LFC post so it gets a like even though it hurts.
Indeed I am sad, but I respect and understand the decision by Jürgen. Thank You for everything! YNWA❤
as an arsenal fan i shed a tear, knowing this man wont be in the EPL. he is like the enemy you respect like a father figure
Feels like my dad just told me he's leaving 😢. Absolutely gutted. Thank you Jurgen. I wish you the best.
YNWA❤
😢😢😢
Ynwa❤❤❤
Why man 😢😮
Merci Jurgen, nous avons été tellement heureux le 8 octobre 2015 lorsque vous êtes devenu notre manager. LFC est fait pour vous et vous êtes fait pour le club. DOUBTER TO BELIEVER. la pair entre votre staff et Michael Edwards c'était parfait. Vous nous avez ramené au sommet du football avec amour travail passion fair-play. WE LOVE YOU. I'm so glad song, le geste des "3 points" vers le Kop à la fin des matches cela rempli notre coeur. Vous êtes comme Bill Schankly, Bob Paisley et Sir Kenny Dalglish une légende, une belle personne.  Nous vivons l'ère Klopp à Liverpool avec tous ses titres :  la PL en 2020 après 30 ans d'attentes, vous larmes ce soir là étaient aussi les notres. La champions league en 2019 avec ce moment de communion à la fin du match retour à Anfield contre Barcelone et ce YNWA de frissons. la coupe d'Angleterre , la carabao cup, le community shield ainsi que la coupe du monde des clubs. Et peut-être d'autres cette année.  Je n'oublierai jamais non plus l'émotion du match retour en europa league contre Dortmund le 4-3, et tous les matches durant toutes ses saisons contre Manchester United : 5-0 à Old Trafford, le 7-0 à Anfield, les rencontres de dingues contre Arsenal avec une pluie de buts, sans oublier les rencontres de folies avec Manchester city notamment les 3 buts en 8 minutes de Bobby en poteau rentrant, la reprise de volée de Mané du gauche et le lobe de Salah, et l'ouverture du score d'un missile d'Oxlade Chamberlain en debut de rencontre. La saison à 99 points et on n'est pas champions, mais une équipe qui est tout pour nous. La victoire aux tir au buts contre Chelsea avec Adrian, encore contre Chelsea et les 11 tirs aux buts dont celui de Virgil contre Kepa mémorable!  Merci pour avoir reconstruit cette équipe en lui donnant une âme une telle force, une sacrée mentalité et une telle générosité avec VVD, TAA, Salah, Robertson, Alisson, Fabinho, Mané, Firmino (même si il est arrivé sous Rodgers), Hendo et Milner (tous 2 déja au club) et n'oublions pas le super sub Origi, le polyvalent Gomez, l'inusable Wijnaldum, j'adore Matip, ainsi que Tsimikas, les progression de Jones et Eliott, les arrivées de Jota, Diaz, Nunez, Konate et Gakpo et les jeunes pousses du club Kelleher,  Bajcetic, Quansah, Bradley, Morton... et les arrivées récentes pour notre milieu de terrain Mac Alister, Szoboszlai, Endo, Gravenberg.  Durant cette période il y a aussi le nouveau centre d'entrainement, les 2 extensions d'Anfield. Avec vous nous avons repris notre place un grand parmi les grands. Les 2 parades dans Liverpool après le titre en UCL et en Carobao cup et FA Cup étaient merveilleuses. Vous avez construit pour aujourd'hui et pour demain. Quel héritage! Nous pleurons aujourd'hui mais nous respectons votre choix. Aimer c'est laisser partir.  Jurgen à jamais dans nos coeurs YNWA.
Welcome to Old Trafford! ❤
💔
Sat here making my 'Don't leave us Mr Klopp' banner😭😭😭
Thank you for everything Jürgen Klopp ❤ YNWA ❤
😢😢😢
O Leader! My Leader! 🫡🫡🫡
It is with a mixture of admiration and melancholy that I pen this to bid farewell to a remarkable era in Liverpool Football Club's history. The news of Jurgen Klopp's departure at the end of the season has undoubtedly stirred emotions among the vast family of Liverpool supporters worldwide.  Jurgen, your tenure at Anfield has been nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment you arrived, you brought a renewed sense of hope, passion, and an unwavering commitment to excellence. Your infectious enthusiasm, touchline antics, and, most importantly, your undeniable impact on the team have left an indelible mark on the hearts of every Liverpool fan. Under your guidance, we witnessed incredible triumphs, unforgettable moments, and a style of football that captured the imagination of the entire footballing world. The Premier League title, and the Champions League glory – these are just a few chapters of the story you've written with Liverpool. Your legacy is one of unity, resilience, and a relentless pursuit of greatness.  To the Liverpool supporters, you have been the backbone of this journey. Your unwavering support through thick and thin has been the driving force behind the team's success. The songs, the banners, the sea of red – you created an atmosphere that turned Anfield into a fortress and made Liverpool more than just a football club, but a global family. As Jurgen Klopp bids farewell to Anfield, let us collectively express our deepest gratitude for the joy, pride, and camaraderie he has brought to our lives. Jurgen, you are not just leaving a football club; you are leaving an everlasting legacy etched in the hearts of millions.  To the supporters, as we navigate through this moment of transition, let us continue to stand united, supporting the team through the highs and lows that undoubtedly lie ahead. The spirit of Liverpool endures, and the bond forged during Klopp's tenure will remain unbreakable. Wishing Jurgen Klopp all the success in his future endeavors, and may the Liverpool family continue to thrive, building upon the foundation of passion, unity, and love for the beautiful game.  You'll Never Walk Alone.
Kloppdruple to close this chapter surely, boys? YNWA!
He will be back
no I'm going to cry..., he will always be a legend in Liverpool,once a red always a red Jürgen Klopp ❤
The premier league loses another top manager. Is this the begining of the end ?
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I can only see him joining one club after Pool... That is Real Madrid but he said hes tierd... I can see hom be at real in the next 1-3 years if not idk if he step down completely or... Only time will tell.
Devastated! Go take a year off Jurgen, Pep can hold the reins until you’re ready to come back. Legend ❤
This guy deservena statue in anfield!!!!
i've just spat my tea across the room when i saw this pop up, we now need to go all out blood sweat and tears with every inch of last breath just to give this great man the parting gift he rightfully DESERVE's then we need to honor him not just with a guard of honor BUT a statue in its rightful place next to shank's AND or rename the main stand after him, lets give this manager the parting gift he rightly deserve's
He actually extended because his wife asked "are we leaving these people". YNWA boss
As a United fan I know how you're all feeling right now. It sucks!
I love this man ynwa
Only person who wants to stop a parting Klopp league title is Paul Tierney
As a Utd fan, I can say Klopp is a top bloke, top manager and the Premier League will be a lot poorer without him.
A bit sad but respect his decision ❤
NOOOOO 😢
A Man United fan but much respect to Klopp for what he has achieved at Liverpool.. Brought them back to the very top
Tears from Indonesia! YNWA Klopp!
Massive respect for Jurgen from an Utd fan
I had a feeling 2024 was gonna be rough but this wasn't on the cards 😩
A definition of Class , Humble Gentlemen, a true Hero all the hardwork he put will never be forgotten and will be an inspiration to millions of people, you can feel how much he cares about the fans and the club and he really didnt need to be this detailed but he did it out of love , much respect to Jurgen Klopp ❤ , p.s not a liverpool fan
Klopp, You’ll Never Walk Alone
You gave me back my pride. Thank you so much kloppo.
I am so sad that he is leaving are club he his the best manger he has done us pround. I will miss him as our manger
Im a chelsea fan and i will always love this guy, lets have one more draw before he goes
Noo!!!😭😭
Here We go Sir Alex Ferguson LOL
This is heartbreaking... I didin't expect these news today, never the less thank you Klopp for everything. We will miss you! ❤😭
Thanks for the fun ride, Boss. If you ever miss football again, please come back here instead of going anywhere else. YNWA
I’m a United fan, and I’m not laughing. This guy should be an example to all managers, just listening to him made me feel sad. He knows how to be a leader, understand loyalty and is a good human. He is a big loss to Liverpool and the premier league. Enjoy your well deserved time jurgen
As a City fan, this man made Liverpool more of a rival to us than United. Massive respect. You will be missed.
Thankyou,  Thankyou,  Thankyou,  Thankyou  coach for everything❤
The most emotional video ever
What a man! Sad too see him go, but we have to respect him <3  One of the all time greats
Maybe this can be Liverpool’s Last Dance moment. Extra motivation to send Klopp off with a PL title
Thanks for the trophies and the memories Jürgen..👍🏻..alonso for me to take over?
Thank you Jurgen Klopp! <3
Спасибо за всё мистер Клопп. Ты никогда не будешь один (YNWA).
😢😢😢
Bayern Fan here. The Football in Europe will miss u. U Are a legend. I‘m so happy to saw him for a one Time.
As an Arsenal fan I’m such a fan of klopp. I’m genuinely sad he is leaving the epl. I wish him the best of luck in the future.
❤
💔💔💔💔
An absolute shock!😢
As a spurs fan... Klopp broke my heart at Madrid  but i still have the respect of him as an elite manager..Huge Loss for Liverpool and the PL as a character
My first heartbreak💔
Thank you Klopp. Won't begrudge him his decision. Takes massive courage to do it this way. This man has been a revelation for this club. Let's celebrate him til he fuggin leaves! I was quietly confident at the beginning of this season that it will be a good one and I'm less quiet now 😊.
All the way from Kenya. The coach that me love football. I became a Liverpool fan just because of him. All the best Klopp, your influence traverses across football. You will forever be a legend.
Amazing manager, you will be missed. Good luck in all your future endeavours.
Can't believe how gutted this has made me. It's like I've just heard someone died. I wish him all the best of course, it just feels like the end of the world right now.
Japanese is sad、
Started supporting Liverpool when this wild unique German coach came over. The Normal One. He has introduced me to the international game, and made me love a city I've never been to. Klopp is a legend beyond words and saying he will be missed it selling it short. He will leave an emotional vacuum, but we respect his decision for his health. YNWA ❤
Thank you. I'll never forget you , Boss ❤
This is not happening. My day cannot get any worse. This isn't true.
Jürgen, we will never forget you. Your legacy, your passion, all you have done for this city and this club. You are such a truly special person, a friend to all of us. Never, ever will we take what you have done for Liverpool for granted. God bless you my friend. ❤️
Liverpool lost there Alex ferguson Now  watch the dip in form and trying to find the right manger players will leave players will be left out cause they don't suit the manger all you have to do is look at Manchester United in the last 10 years
I accept your choice, he will always the a person who changed not just the club, but the game.  For us to realize it’s just a game   Thank you
Will be missed by the whole country, not just us. A true Legend of the game, even the Mancs and Evertonians struggled to hate him 😂
Jurgen, Danke Shon, all the best on your Endeavors. When you do decide to take on another Club all the best. You are truly the Ordinary One. You have made your mark in the Legendary of Anfield. Any Liverpool fan will never forget what you have done for the club, bring in players that have never been heard of and making them into world class players. You have revitalize the club to the top of the world.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
End of an era, thanks for everything, time to go out with a bit more silverware!
I'm rooting for Xabi Alonso to win the Bundesliga & DFB Pokal this season.
End of an era. Absolutely devastated. Klopp was the embodiment of everything Liverpool FC represented. Liverpool isn't just a football club, it's a way of life. This club has helped me through some particularly tough moments during my life and Klopp was the steward of that ship. Not enough words to describe the boss, but a red he will always be until the Shankly Gates call him home. You'll never walk alone Jurgen, Thank you for everything 🕊   "From doubters to believers"
This is a sad day for liverpool fans. I hope all the best for him and hope they smash the rest of the season. YNWA
Message at the end says it all
Oh no. 3 season again plis
Fantastic bloke. Good luck klopp from a forest fan
💔😭😭
He will manage again but I'm sure it will be as German head coach.
🔴YNWA You are my Hero, Legend, GOAT
I can’t believe it
It seems he was annoyed with Liverpool's management where players suffered injuries and did not take action to transfer several players
just can't see a great game of klopp vs pep again, a big lost on football
Jurgen , where ever you go , what ever you do , we wish you well , and always remember  Y.N.W.A.,  ❤
You'll never walk alone Klopp ! You and Liverpool are always the best combo. We love you !
Yesss let’s go get pep out of here next please 🤣🤣
Nothing lasts for ever 💔 thank you Boss for everything
Love you forever, you made Liverpool the team I fell in love with when I was a kid, and even better than I could ever imagine/dream of. All LFC fans owe you a big part of our joy and smiles last 8 years. Wishing you the best, supporting you always, love you massively! ❤YNWA
I'm heartbroken but I know that this will definitely happen someday. Just that I didn't see it coming too soon. JURGEN IS A RED, NOW AND ALWAYS!!!❤
I pray to god we win the league for this man he deserves it YNWA
We love you klopp, we love you....we will always love you
Gerrard or xabi Alonso let go🔥
Heartbroken to hear this news 😭.  Thanks a lot Jurgen for giving those unforgettable moments for every Liverpool fan. I’ll surely miss you next season.   Heartfelt Note: Danke Jurgen🫡🫡🫡🫡  YNWA Jurgen🙏🏼
😢gutted. Absolute Legend for the club already

World Class Manager. Wish you all The Best and Good Luck. RESPECT 👏👏💪⚽️
Jurgen you made our dreams come true,thank you YNWA
I'm speechless.......
You'll always be our manager. You'll never walk alone, Jurgen.
As a newcastle fan i think this is bad for us, never mind liverpool, if nufc are looking to upgrade the manger while Liverpool are looking to find a new one that's a fucking nightmare for us, I think Eddie is a mint manager but we need to go to the next step next year with both players and manager. You know klopp is never coming to Newcastle either so that's out the question he fucking hates us haha
Absolutely heartbreaking 💔
YNWA boss 😢❤
I will always be watching klopp wherever he ends up next,that's how much I love this man and his personality
I really like his decision to tell everybody the news half a year before season ends. For me it's just another proof of his love and care for the club, although I had no doubt about it anyway. I totally understand and accept his decision. I feel like I know what it's like too because I've been in kinda similar situation in life, just with much less responsibility in it, still it was quite significant for me and the people around me. It felt weird as well to think 'well i can still do it now and i really like doing it, but I know it's the right time to leave in [three] months'. It's kinda like eating a piece of cake that your friend cooked for you, you know. 'I don't want to eat the whole cake but not beacuse i don't like it. It's just beacuse I like it THE MOST when I eat just one or two pieces'. I find his decision and the explanation to be of so high quality that it even annoys me that he has to explain it to people for so many times in different ways for 25 minutes. But I think I understand why he does it. He just wants to make sure that every single person gets it, especially those who never been in such situations in life.
Man utd fan here I'm happy but sad at the same time. That's how great Klopp is I suppose, i hope he'll be coming back to coaching again soon.
Heartbroken. But extremely grateful. Thank you Jurgen, you've delivered dreams and more to Liverpool fans. We are so lucky you are our manager. You will always be our incredible, extraordinary manager. YNWA.
This video might have just secured Liverpool the title this season. Everyone involved, the players, the staff, the fans, has something to get behind more than ever and thats Klopp. This might turn out to be his greatest act of genius of all his years at the club.
Thanks for making us believe. We need Alonso to replace him
The club will  be always missing kloop❤
The love for this guy ...yohhhh we gonna miss him big time .....He will never walk alone ..cheers to the future......legends always live on ...Much love for Klopp
Rangers man. Love this guy man. Thanks for the pumping aswel klopp at anfield and ibrox😅 much appreciated! All the best man such a class act❤
I love him. I’ll miss him. I wish him well.
Please Jürgen come home and rescue German Football. We need you as National Coach!
meant so much to all of us.😭❤
Best manager in the world. truly amazing job you did and you will always be a legend. leaving the club in a good place is the right thing to do so full respect and i wish you all the best in the future
A lot of people respect you and wish you well even from a M U fan like me.  But football is in a mess, too many games, too much money, too much player power, too many international games & competitions planned, VAR a mess and it not fun for fans, managers, and players even anymore. People who control the sport need to take notice as everything is being diluted in the trajectory it's going.  There clearly no work-life balance they get paid huge yes, but the cost on family and life for many isn't worth it so we have to respect those that say enough is enough.  I hope you are  well, and find other interests and enjoy time away from football to either rest or find time to enjoy it in other ways.
Similar to when Gerrard left, we knew it would happen but it's still tough to accept. Good luck Klopp, you'll always have a home in our hearts.
Massive respect for him . We , Culérs , have a very bittersweet history with him , but there's no doubt that no one has done more for Liverpool than him . He is still lived in Dortmünd and I am 100% certain that the Sousers are surely going to love him forever .
I am so shocked for this news, I never thought Klopp left the clubs as urgently, but I respect his decision, and I believe that Liverpool will be in his mind forever. ❤ see you again one day LFC
Absolute legend and a gentleman to the end. Sometimes we forget that these people are human. From one human to another, thank you for the amazing memories and for your 1,000,000%. Have the best life.
Good luck for boss YNWA❤ Now Xabi time to shine!
😶
Klopp tried for the club. If he says he's fed up to manage the club(Liverpool) let him go. All what I know is that he was forced to make the decision of leaving. The problem might come out from FSG(I mean the owner of the club). Because the club owner doesn't want to release money to buy good players. And he wants the club to wins trophy at the expense of the club manager and the players.
어디감 계속있지 ㅠ
Thank you Jürgen for your wonderful service. Its been a honour 👊👊👊
Good luck, mate ❤
barcelona ok Jürgen Klopp
Thank you, JK. You're a great manager
Klopp ❤
Klopp is quitting as he is scared of Angeball at Tottenham next season 😂
Rename the Kop end the Klopp end. By far the greatest manager this club has ever had in the modern era. Sad AF to see him go
As a Chelsea fan...I'm actually sad to see such an icon leave...prem won't be the same without klopp. But I can see Liverpool continuing on without klopp...they have the spine we threw out of our club.
KLOPP FOREVER A LEGEND ❤
The premier league without jurgen klopp is like a dish prepared with it's most tasteful ingredient.
😢❤ I 100% Liverpool fan Jc is also a human being,so its decision hearts me but no way, finally i do say all the best wishes!! And miss you so much chief.
Im afraid that liverpool gonna be same as chelsea… since abramovic left the club, chelsea was no longer a big club… the fall down was coming and we need to be prepared as a liverpool fans
Legend …. YNWA
YNWA Sir. Thank you for all you have done for Liverpool. Massive respect for you and what you have done for the team and city.
He made Liverpool a world class club once again. I think they will struggle after he has gone.
This news brings back the pain when Kenny Dalglish left Liverpool the very first time…. So sad… I do sincerely wish you the best Jürgen.. you transformed our beloved club for the better.. but still this news is heartbreaking…YNWA 💯
Thank you Jurgen ❤ for everything you did for Liverpool FC. You made us believe again and put the club back to where we were among the football giants. YNWA
:( i have no words. thank you for everything Klopp
A sad day for Liverpool.
rivalry aside, he's been a great manager, but if you watch the interview i fear its more serious, sounds like an Illness hence why he's going and i don't blame him life is more precious than work or football, wish him all the best.
As a City fan, I wish him the best. He is quite a character.
My heart is so sore 😳😳😳
They said man don't cry but that's impossible rn
We love you, Klopp!
Klopp goes in our hearts and will never walk alone ❤❤❤❤
Thank you Jurgen🙏🙏🙏
Thank you for the years of joy ❤❤❤❤
Get Steven Gerrard from Saudi
I'm in bits.  I would give the man a year off. Let Pep Lijnders take the helm for the year.   I think every Liverpool supporter has been banking on a good few more years of Kloop. But everyone needs a break from time to time. I get it 100%.
😢😢😢 Mr klopp take a break, its clear you need it from this interview. We will love you no matter what  YNWA ❤❤❤❤ but please come and run the club CEO ???
The news heart broke for lfc fans  and family
A legend is leaving...Good luck Jurgen
😪😪
Legend. Legend. Legend. Thank you.
Day of mourning for the City of Liverpool. You'll never walk alone.
Thank you Jurgen ❤
😥😢😭 I saw the last game with Jürgen & BVB (vs Werder Bremen), maybe I will make it to the last one of Jürgen & LFC 🥹
This team now needs to do him prouder than ever before. He’s considered a fatherly figure to his players. Make him proud once more. Will somebody else really create a new legacy like Klopp has, I don’t think so because I don’t think you’ll ever find a better character than him in the game. I know Gerrard has always been fond of the task but can he pull off the spirit of Klopp, debatable one. The respect he has gained from even rival supporters says a lot and not many managers have ever had that respect shown to them. This could either move the clubs future forward or it could make the past a big talking point. I accept his decision 110% but someone has always said to me treat everything like I match, you never know what will happen till that final whistle is blown and I stick to that. Will he be happy, I think he’ll be mixed up now it’s gone public and that can usually take a big emotional effect behind the scenes which for many people he will have days he’ll question his decision. I think he will definitely be gone but I think he’ll look in his mirror debating his decision if the club ends the season successful. But I think now the atmosphere needs to be explosive from now on so when he goes he can say wow that’s one way to exit because he’s always thrived on atmosphere, you never know that can either make him stumble in slight regret. Atmosphere changes the mood, so make it unbearable
Oh, dear. That’s just not fair.  Thanks and god bless you.
It's sad about this, but life must go on. thank you very much boss, you are the best coach we have ever had, thank you for what you gave to our club. Good luck on your next journey, YNWA
God bless and thank you so much.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
YNWA
I’m gutted we won’t ever be the same
We all knew it was coming but we have to accept it. klopp YNWA💯🩸 thanks for everything
No matter what the decision klopp will still be in liverpools heart😊❤❤❤❤😢
Truly a club legend, a great leader and an inspirational human being. Transformed Liverpool football club to being the best in the world again. Truly love you Jurgen Klopp. You made me love watching Liverpool play again.  You will be one of the best and most legendary coaches the game has ever seen. ❤ YNWA
Wasn't expecting this news today, I'm wondering who LFC will bring in. Klopp has been unbelievable since he came. Gutted. YNWA
I will NEVER forget the memories and happiness you brought me Jurgen. Thank you.
nooo.... 😭😭😭
Liverpool and Klopp is always the best combo. It's a heartbreaking news but we understand Klopp. We will always love and respect you !
English media and FA corruption 👍
Which country will he be coaching in 2026?
This hurts
Liver pool should make this men statue in liverpool so every one will remember this men how great he was
You will never walk alone ❤
Am in shock 😲 what?
The man is class
Liverpool must make some statues for this man ..he is a fantastic man as manager!!👏👏
ty next
This is difficult news to hear. Jurgen re-invigorated my love for football and this team. I’ve always been a supporter but since his tenure started, Liverpool have been the most exciting, enthralling and enthusiastic team to watch. The club and fans will miss him dearly but I’m sure everyone can understand why he’s stepping down. Heavy metal football demands a high and intense energy that can’t be sustained forever and everyone deserves to experience a normal life. I know he’ll see the season out with the same commitment and enthusiasm we know him for. YNWA🔴
What a legend. Thank you for everything! YNWA.
The Kop End Should Be Renamed KLOPP END. Thank you for the best moments in our lives Boss. Truly heartbroken
You'll be missed by many of us. And you will go down in history with the likes of paisley We thank you for everything you have done for Liverpool. Let's take cup at Wembley In February I reckon we will win the FA Cup  and the Premier League. Let's go out with a bang 🎉🎉
No man. This hurts more than any player leaving. I will be a Liverpool fan forever but LFC will never feel the same without him. The post match celebration with the fans, the press conference moments, the parade celebration. I really wished he never left but all the best. YNWA
Still remember Klopp's words when he first joined LFC. It's now how you come in that's important, it's how you leave that's more important.
you got me crying Boss, u embodied more than football
I went into this video thinking it was a joke or some clickbait but deep down i knew, man this broke my heart, WE LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT❤❤❤
Thanks KLOPP
Thank you for everything Jurgen! You have transformed the club back to a fortress! You will certainly be missed 😢
No Klopp, we are not having it, we are not accepting Nothing, your not going nowhere , we will lock klopp in the grounds, he will stay there to the day he dies, he can manage the team as a ghost 👻 giving halftime talks to the team 😂😂😂 All fun and jokes aside, I kinda understand..  probably his interaction with Ericsson probably brought it home for him even more.,  the fact that you need a normal life before it’s too late in life.. and life is too short..   you’ll Never Walk alone klopp  We thank you for everything,  I think he just needs time to miss management, than he will be back..  next chapter/manager for LFC has the be Alonso..
Wolves fan gere, great respect for klopp God bless you for the future
Roy Hodgson is free
Thank you for all the great memories 😢❤😢❤😢😢❤😢❤😢😢❤😢❤😢❤
Jurgen will always be a Liverpool legend! Sad day 😢
When they redo the kop they should add an L to it
Its been a pleasure watching klop transform liverpool, brillant Man, will miss his charisma and energy,  You'll never walk alone
Thank you Jurgen!!  YNWA!!
This is shocking for me to hear klopp leaving Liverpool, My Respect to every decision you make will be there. One of the best all time manager
I am crying ...i am dead inside now ....boss love u so much...i hope whatever u do in the future u do ur atmost best ....I LOVE U SO MUCH JURGEN❤❤
Man nailed us 7. I respect you boss
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Surely he deserves a statue?
Thank you Jurgen. ❤
Lets go win him the league
Thanks Klopp for everything his done. Hope next manager continues the good work.
Sad to see him go. However he will manage again and I predict he will become the German National coach after the Euros.
Danke Jurgen Klopp. ❤
I totally understand, I would imagine it takes its toll mentally.  You will always be a red mate
Thanks for all the memories!!!
Welcome to Manchester united Mr Clopp  So we can give Liverpool the bald guy🤯
Noooooo 😢😢
Thankyou
😔😔
We will always love you Jurgen. You will always be one of us
i am starting to think that pep is our next manager.
Holding back my tears love from Nairobi, Kenya ❤❤❤❤❤

We love you Klopp!! Been an iconic manager and I wish you all the best in your ventures in the future, take your break come back bouncing for a national team. YNWA!!!

back to the jay spearing days you go
Thanks for all the good memories Klopp wish you all the best YNWA
Thank you Jurgen, this is the best possible way of departing our club. You have my respect and blessing, you’re only human and deserve to enjoy your normal life and a normal guy….please don’t sell us out and go to Citeh though!! Y.N.W.A
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😱
Living Legend ❤
💔💔💔
Vielen Dank für deinen unermüdlichen Einsatz und Respekt für deine Entscheidung, Jürgen. 🙏 Ich verstehe dich. Man kann den Motor nicht auf Dauer auf Volllast fahren. Glückwunsch, dass du die Zeichen erkannt hast, und das Richtige für dich tust, bevor dir dein Inneres von alleine die Energie drosselt und dich unsanft nach unten zwingt. Die Welt hat noch andere Dinge zu bieten für die kurze Zeit, die wir hier auf der Erde sind. Ich wünsche dir viel Freude für deine Zukunft - wie auch immer du sie gestalten magst. YNWA
thanks a lot for everything my boss, ynwa reds.
😢😢
I am chelsea fan but i fucking love this guy now i dont want to beat him in carabao cup final it could be his last trophy. May the best win
Where ever you go, you'll never walk alone. Thank you for the years of glory,  of losses, thank you for sticking around for this long.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for this wonderful yet at times rocky journey. I have never doubted you one bit Jurgen, from the moment you became the gaffer I knew, I knew for sure that believing in you is the right and only way to go. All the best for the future but before that, let's fucking end the season on a high. Liverpool 2.0 by Jurgen Klopp is right on track. We are Liverpool, this means more, YNWA.
Noo , don't plz😢🙏
He is normal one normal life
As a red, i am devastated but it would be better if he announced it the end of the season instead. This announcement might kill morale while we are top of the table, carabao final, and were looking like both europa and fa contenders. All in all i respect his decision and wish him well goodbye Klopp. Legend
tears in rain
He needs a statue. I'd rename the Kop the Klopp and I doubt a single Liverpool fan would have an issue with it. He brought a team I love and pulled them out of mediocrity and took us to european glory...premier league glory....pretty much every trophy he could achieve he did. I love Jurgen and the idea of him leaving breaks me in two but it was going to happen sooner rather than later anyway I think. We love you to the moon and back Jurgen and always will.
As Real Madrid fan football fan and the Brotherhood ive got with Liverpool fans after what uefa did to most of them at the paris final it is a very sad day because the way Liverpool played through the years since Mr. Klopp took over was a magnificent football for fans and much better for me than anybody else in europe including my team. Thanks for everything as a football manager but also as a wonderful human being you are.
Thank you for everything
Ruh dich erstmal richtig aus Jürgen. Und dann mach mal unsere Nationalmannschaft wieder fit.
we will need Alonso
What a man
This break my heart
So grateful for what this man has done for the club and the fantastic shape that he will leave it in for the next manager. Thank you Jurgen, and wishing you every success in whatever comes next. YNWA
He just talked for 24 minutes and said nothing lol
Jürgen, come home to germany and take a break. You deserve it.
Habi Alonso next
Thanks Boss x YNWA
Liverpool ynwa❤❤❤
I LOVE YOU SO DUCKING MUCH KLOPP  🥲❣️NEVER WALK ALONE GO ENJOY YOUR NORMAL LIFE
noo Klopp  :(
I'm a life long arsenal fan but I love klopp. The way he articulates himself his passion the way Liverpool fans talk about him, everything is just pure class.  I'm in shock he's leaving and the premier league will be less without him.  Good luck for the rest of the season, and if we can't win it then I hope Liverpool do.   I think the most heartfelt thing I can say is I would be proud to call him my manager ❤
Dont go ple ..
This nuh look good😮
Please built the statue
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Danke für die wunderschönen Fußballmomente, du hast dir das verdient! ❤🏝
this hurts , but nothing lasts forever. I am so thankful for what  he has done for our club, and he will always stay in our hearts. He is the most beautiful character as a manager that we could ever dream of. I wish you and your family the very best, Boss.
Man City fan, have enormous respect for Klopp and what he's achieved. The title run ins and rivalry has been a joy. Huge loss for the Premier League.   👏👏👏
You will be missed Jurgen, A true Liverpool Legend YNWA
The greatest Liverpool manager of all time. Already gave us more than he promised. Danke Jürgen.
Absolutely a legend his amazing character and charisma , work rate and knowledge.. he’s the best around
Lost for words and truly heartbroken. What an absolute legend. We will always love you & ‘ you’ll never walk alone’
Heart breaking 💔, the gaffer
End of an Era!😢 He truly does love Liverpool and he is just being truthful by saying he cannot keep doing this everyday. Football is an everyday job. I will miss Klopp vs Pep days very much.  I'm excited to see how the season plays out.
Its happening.. Its alright, atleast we've been together with him and all those good memory's Farewell Klopp Ty soo much
Klasse, was "the normal one" in Liverpool aufgebaut hat! Tolles Team, toller Verein. Hoffentlich kommt ein guter Nachfolger!
From a Man Utd fan , Good luck for the future Jürgen and to your family, you are one of the best Managers EVER ,full admiration and Respect from me to. Liverpool legend 👏👏👏
The next Liverpool manager will have very big shoes to fill.
I don’t want him to go and no one else related to the club wants this but all I can say and do is thank him for all he’s done! Absolute legend, definitely a club legend at least! From being a crappy prem team always going for Europa league to an absolute powerhouse in world football again, thank you for all you’ve done Jürgen, we will never forget what you’ve done! YNWA!!!!!!!
Best manager ever... Thank you for everything
What a sad day. It's so hard to comprehend. I will miss you, Jurgen - you made me dream❤
I’m a Celtic fan and we never got anything like this from Brendan Rodger’s or Ange. At least Klopp has given you time to take in what’s happening he will always be a legend.
❤ kloop 😢
I am completely devastated
❤🔥🙌
Well will miss you boss for the memories you've done at a club jurgen but I pray the club will remain the same
HA!  Good bye Flip Flop
I'm not crying Boss 😢
welcome to barca!
Jürgen ❤
Feels like the man just burned out and it’s ok. Thanks for everything, Kloppo! YNWA ❤
no pls We need you boss
Well I will say at the end of season...Thank you J.K for everything !!  But let us end with a blast!!
I'm not crying, you're crying! 😢 Jurgen, you are up there with Shankly for sure and you'll never walk alone! Build the man a statue
Welcome to Barcelona
Oke no problem ❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Theres 0 chance liverpool don't win the league now.. the fans alone will make it happen.
what will premier league be without jurgen klopp, but YNWA for the legend <3
RIP LFC
Legend. Legend. Legend. YNWA
I hope he manages the club till he can. Bdw, Klopp isn't leaving the club. He'll be forever with Liverpool,no matter where he is.  I fell in love with football and  Liverpool after he started  managing the club.  Please build a statue and a big permanent mural in Anfield.
My dream is to just one time in life work for a leader like this, I know each one of his players feel blessed to have gotten the priveledge. Such a genuine and bright character.
Jurgen I’m a crying right now but before you leave I had one dream win the premier league again for us for whole Liverpool win the premier league for us players will have to give everything for him now
???????????????????
It will be a crying shame if he leaves having not properly got to celebrate a league with us. I pray we win it this year now more than ever
YNWA
Thank you Jürgen , your always gonna be known as one of the best or the best for Liverpool FC
Thank you for all the memories Klopp, i will miss you so much, best of luck for the rest of the season. YNWA
We love you Juergen hope you have great success weather you retiring or going to a new club or international job we will always love you and thanks for all the great things you’ve done to the club and others in need
im city fans, but dang... i dont now how to say, but im sad to know this... 9 years , 9 Incredible years, we fought a lot each other and i enjoy every single game we meet....  Thanks for everything Klopp, u are one of the best coach in EPL history, thats for sure
Ini terlalu menyakitkan 😢😢😢
Like a death in the family 🥺
This is such a sad news.
Klopp please 🙏 stay 😢 😅
Absolutely gutted. I have a feeling unless we get in someone at his level we have many of years of hurt pending.
😭😭😭
Cuando todo está perfectamente balanceado y por un buen camino en la vida, aparece esta noticia para darle un gancho al hígado a todo  :( YNWA Klopp
Thank you for everything ❤
ynwa 🥲
What a mann!!! ❤ YNWA KLOPP
HA HA HA HA HA HA
Dortmund 🙂
I always said only one person can replace klopp if he quit and that person is Antonio Conte.
Arsenal fan here. OMG am surprised it comes out of nowhere it took me by surprise i loved this man he fought the most corrupt club "Man City" with little budget and unknown signings. No manager will do what he did with the resource limitations for almost 9 years. I hope this season if not Arsenal Liverpool 🏆 the PL. You are amusing Sr.
Absolutely gutted.
I've been supporting the club since I could walk..I'm 50 years of age,I travel to games from Ireland,  4 , 5 times a year...bringing my two boys...only yesterday i booked the Brighton game..I'm so happy I did...my youngest boy is inconsolable...from the bottom of our hearts Jurgen...❤ thank you ..YNWA
Back home for sure! Swell, there are only two possibilities! National team or Bayern! 😎
Thanks for the memories YNWA
dont u worry reds, i dont think so hes going anywhere..its jus a usual kloops mind games for the liverpool owner..
Am heartbroken😭
Liverpool will fall apart. when he leaves...... i didn't they will allow him go
❤❤❤
I hope he's OK. All the best, from a United fan.
i think he going Dortmund club. great Manager
It's really hearthbreaking. I still can't believe in this. Thank you for everything, Boss. We will miss you so much. With love from Ukraine. YNWA ❤️❤️‍🔥
It's fine....😢😢😭       I don't want to back that times when he's not with us 😥😥😥😭😭😭😭😭
I never thought I would see LFC win the league in my lifetime. Jurgen, thank you. YNWA ❤️
The whole football's world respect you. It doesn't matter if you're a Liverpool fan or not.
You will always be one of ours🙌♾️You'll Never Walk Alone❤
*Best news this year LOL*
I got a feeling he will be back one day............YNWA
THE manager
😭
A sad day but all I want to do is thank him for everything, what a legend
All good things….
We Under stand and we thank you Kloop for your energy and management all these years  you made up believe again and showed us that we are Liverpool until that days comes for  now lets finish this season strong ! Y N W A
Dear Jurgen Klopp Thank you for everything you have done for Liverpool FC
Mannschaft, no question about it
Devastated.😢
Doesnt matter if im a United fan, still gotta admit this guy is undoubtedly the best manager in the world last 10 years.
I'm a Chelsea fan and this is just saddening I love what  he had built in liverpool and hope they win the league there football is fantastic 😢
Build him a Statue!!!!
I am devastated but i respect and support Jurgen
He's a special manager and would love him at my club! Thinking 🤔 8 years or so he been at Liverpool, Seems maybe the stress of managing a top club can take its toll! Hopefully he wins a few trophies before he leaves! Love his passion and I ain't a Liverpool fan but respect Jürgen and Liverpool! 🍀⭐👍
LOVE SEEING SCOUSERS CRY,ITS USUALLY WHEN THE DWP SANCTION THEIR BENEFITS BUT ILL TAKE THIS 😂😂😂
😢😢😢😢😢
A sad day for football. Rivals will be buzzing.
Already Missing Klopp. Thank You Very Much For The Things You Did @ Anfield. YNWA!
Hope you win the league this year. You deserve man! ManUtd fan here. So envious for not having a coach like that.
YNWA
Too sad, hope we win it all together this year, we deserve it. Thanks Jurgen x
‘…. because nobody sack me…’ we would be furious with last season result with anybody but you jurgen.😊
You sir are a fking legend , wish well rest and we every trophy we win is gonna be for you
*PMSL 🤣🤣🤣🤣*
I’d honestly give him a year off if he wants….and give him the job back when he’s ready. My generations Shankley. 🫶🏼😢
As he said at the beginning : "It´s not important what people think about you, when you come in , it´s much more important what people think about you, when you  leave"    I won't forget this sentence anytime soon
I just want to say aswell. Thank you klopp for all the years of dreams coming true, you changed us for the better, your like the dad of the club. You will always be a red klopp and you will be welcomed bk anytime.
I've been dreading this day if I'm honest. It's not a nice thing to see pop up out of the blue, but Klopp please know we understand, we love you and we just want you to be happy. Personally I respect your decision, still hurts like hell though! Everything you've done for this club will never be forgotten - you turned doubters into believers and we've loved every second of the journey, thank you for everything Klopp, You'll never walk alone! Now someone wake me up and tell me it's April 1st... 😢
A sad day in history YNWA ❤
From a Utd fan  What a manager 👏 pep is tainted at city . This guy was is the best for me ,prob along with Carlo .
They better built him a statue in Anfield or Liverpool city because this guy is a Legend. Thanks coach!
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
the end of LFC Era .... need to find new coach like JK is not a easy task
Thank you for everything boss..You are the reason of our success...Thank you for everything.. Until we meet again...YNWA.
Saya sunguh tidak sangup hati dengan ini. Jurgen telah membuat saya lemah😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Gutted... But what a class act Jurgen Norbert Klopp is
I'm a Man Utd fan, hes going to be missed greatly huge loss. to the prem, brought entertaining football to the league and was the only team to truly challenge and topple city, deserves alot of credit for as well as the little amount he spend compared to rivals .
This is so heartbreaking. 😢 Never thought about the time he won't be our manager but it's here. All the best for your future and you'll be surely  missed.
あなたのサッカーをするリバプールの試合をみる事が土日の楽しみでした。悲しいですが、貴方の決断に異議を唱える人は居ないと思います。 クロップ監督お疲れ様でした。
dammit I had £5 on him leaving last season.
nah,, this is too much man. klopp is Liverpool itself now, fr bro idk how to react now.
I’ll love you forever ❤️ thank you Jurgen
클롭감독님 지금까지 고생 많았습니다. 앞으로 하시는 모든일이 성공하길 빕니다. 리버풀에 보여줬던 열정과 트로피는 영원히 기억속에 남을 거에요. 언제나 건강하고 행복하시길…..❤❤
Stevie G is coming home
As an Arsenal fan, I can appreciate all this man has done not only for Liverpool, but for the EPL.
Seems like germany has a new national coach after the european cup
😄 🤣 😂 😆 😄  UNITED
❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😂😂😂
🥲🥺😭
Thank you Jurgen… we respect your decision. A real Scouser
Very strange but understood it is the best time when team is on top....which might not be thwre by May24 Resign cannot solve self-determining purpose then...❤❤❤❤
So this is what a break up feels like  Klopp is a legend manager 🙏🏻
why you leave??? Liverpool needs you, all of us need you :(((((
Heartbreaking
Time for xabi alonso?
welcome to barcelona😂
💔YNWA❤
❤ he’s all class this man, then add that he won 8/9 of the competitions he competed in 😨 peace out jurgen ✌🏻 you’ll definitely be missed in the epl. Those things that he said in the last minute of the interview set him aside from a good chunk of human beings…a true living legend ⚽️ 🥅
As a MU fan I’m sad to see icon like this leaving premier league. All the best to him
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢

I am still in shock
Sad to hear. But huge respect for making such a hard but nessesary decision.
You make me broken hart, i love Jurgen Klopp and I love LFC to. YNWA♥♥♥
I know many of you may don't know PNG🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬 oh some of you may.  But because of this person. when I saw some highlights of him on Facebook then rest is history because of him I become big Liverpool fan and started watching PL games since. Best of luck Klopp.
The FA Premier League will never be the same and this legend will live on forever at Anfield and around the world in every liverpool fc  fan's hearts & minds🙏 A true GOAT and indefinitely a man that has changed the sport in general forever. Jurgen Klopp is LFC Guardian before anything else, and I really do hope we give everything to give him the most outstanding goodbye he well deserves , on and off the pitch❤
อยู่จนหมดสัญญา ไม่ได้เหรอครับ Boss😢 มันเร็วเกินไป และฉันยังทำใจไม่ได้ถ้าทีมเราไม่มี Boss 😢😢😢
Wherever your are Mr.Klopp, i still trust that everything will be fine.😊 Danke Jürgen❤
Get in there brilliant news from all of us over at Old Trafford
YNWA Jurgen! thankyou!
Gutted truly am thanks jurgen Liverpool legend ❤
Am an Arsenal fan but I want to say that jurgen klopp is a fantastic manager l want to wish jurgen klopp all the best whenever he goes❤🙏
Thank you jurgen .....am just crying and I don't know how to thank you more.
His post match interviews always put other managers with their scripted, vague blah blah non-answers to shame.
Xabi Alonso is the only one that can replace him
I am so heartbroken 😔 we will always love you<3
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you boss for everything you do for LFC ❤
The National Team of Germany need a new Trainer/Manager
I’ve sort of knew for long time that he’s not going to do this for 20+ years. When Klopp signed to stay for more time… it was unexpected given his traditional ritual of 9-10 seasons limit. Whatever the reason… 100% accepted his decision. Finally, I wanted to say thank you so much for everything and many memories are priceless to think about at the moment! You’ll Never Walk Alone ❤
What an incredible example of a brilliant and honest leader. YNWA
Well since you can’t get better than klopp this is bad . He’s achieved the impossible though so what more do we want
Even though it’s one of the worst days as a Liverpool supporter… thank you for everything and all the best for your future Mr.Klopp, YNWA  Auch wenn es als Liverpool Fan ein schwarzer Tag für mich ist… Danke für alles und nur das beste für die Zukunft Herr Klopp YNWA  „I'm so glad that Jurgen is a Red. I'm so glad he delivered what he said.“
Will be a massive miss for Liverpool but it’ll also push them on this season. Klopp leaving might be the biggest motivation to win the league.  He’ll be missed in the PL and deserves a statue outside LFC. YNWA ☝️👍 AFC fan
Wow. This was so painful to listen to. Such a sad day. We all knew it would come but we never wanted it to because we all love him so much. However, despite the ache in my heart, I will always wish him the best. YNWA Kloppo. ❤
So gutted, the news we all knew would come one day but still not prepared for it. An absolute legend and 💯 Liverpool forever. Thank you for giving us your all ❤ YNWA ❤
As a German, I would of course hope that he would become the German national coach in the future 🙏
Best manager ever.
Everything he does. He does for the clubs he coached
Spechless 😢
Thank you Jurgen you will always be a part of the Liverpool family, thank you for the memories best wishes for the future thank you. 😢😢😢ynwa❤
I'm gutted 😢 he gave us everything 😢 I'm so happy that I been able to enjoy KLOPP for his duration at LIVERPOOL ❤, Xabi Alonso your  next ❤🙏 this rocked my morning 🌄 😢😢😢
Every Liverpool fan feels, myself included, Jurgen made Liverpool great again. It's always been a joy seeing him on the touchline. We trusted him with every decision he made, this one. Included. Hopefully another Bundesliga manager is to succeed him, one who faithfully served Liverpool before.
❤
ขอให้โชคดีครับบอส การตัดสินใจในชีวิตของคุณๆมีสิทธิ์ที่จะเลือก ผมก็ยังคงจะรักภัคดีต่อลิเวอร์พูลต่อไป และยังรักคุณต่อไป ขอให้โชคดีครับ บอส
My guess is he will coach either Bayern München or Atletico Madrid
Bruh, my heart is completely broken!
We accept it Jürgen. We love you, You will NEVER walk alone. Now let’s go win some more football games together!
Seems political with background walking with him also.   Klopp is a liverpool legend, the Boss. Build the statue now
Danke für alles Jürgen! Alles Gute für die Zukunft aus Mainz.
Good luck on your new adventure Kloppy and back room staff
I just want to save my tears for when we win everything this season and bid farewell to you properly .
Thank you man, you did very very massive things to us
I’m not a Liverpool fan but this is heartbreaking to see such a character leave the PL I wish this Liverpool legend all the best now I kinda would like Liverpool to win the PL and I’m an Arsenal fan
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING KLOPP
*YNWA*
No way
We love you. YNWA
YNWA Jurgen. LFC’s greatest manager
Danke boss I love you forever
😢
Thankyou Jurgen, God be with you.
Nooooo! Please don’t go…
Watching with tears streaming down my face 100% respect for jurgen all my best wishes for you in the future ynwa love always Steve
YNWA ❤
OMG 😱 Pep's broken Jurgen !
Get alonso
Pep licking his lips
Absolutely gutted. End of an Era. He showed us highs we never thought we'd see again. What a man and what a manager. Thank you for everything, Jurgen.
An honest, successful man that gave and is giving everything. A beautiful way to step down and all to win for the rest of the season. The very best of men. Thank you Mr Kloop. Do not go quietly into the night. rage ! rage !
Thank you for everything Jurgen. YNWA
My 11 years old son will be crying when I ll inform him - I don't thank you, Jürgen :-) good news would be that he goes back to Germany..... wait and see
What best characterizes Jurgen is that all Premier League fans are crying because of his departure, regardless of club preferences. A true legend.
☹️😱😱😭😭 WHAT’S GOING ON… NEVER EVER SAW THIS COMING…. My slogan is tarnished… ‘IN LIVERPOOL AND KLOPP WE TRUST’…. WOWW😭😭😭
Eddie Howe to replace him???
Absolutely gutted. Nobody can replace klopp 😞 more gutted than when any players have left in my 40 year's of being a Liverpool fan. Sir Jürgen klopp you are a legend we will never forget how you changed the whole club top to bottom
Looking for man name 'XABI ALONSO '
Man I haven't cried in a long time but this.. 😔.. BUT like the King said we are Liverpool and we carry on.. Always will love you Klopp regardless.. too many great memories but let's smash this season and finish on an ultimate high for this special man ❤ Love you Klopp YNWA ❤
Klopp is a legend and i sincerely hope the club and his successor continue his legacy and the ethos , workrate, and play style that has become the Liverpool way. This man has brought me so much joy and hope over the past 8 years and was instrumental in reviving the club i love and making it relevant among the best in the world. We are Liverpool, we will continue to be Liverpool, You'll Never Walk Alone. Best of luck for the rest of the season and the future thereafter.
💔💔😢😢😭😭
Wow this is something unheard off hats off to the big man
Look through the bullshit  He wants to leave... Taking a year off, then joining a big foreign team thats already agreed
He said back then that he is the normal one. Now many/everyone will say he is the legendary one.
Am just waiting for the cameras at  Anifield showing our fans and Klop
Liverpool❤Klopp❤Liverpool❤Klopp
Klopp to Madrid 🎉
Its the owners man! We all know u can only go so far with a certain team. And when u keep begging the owners to spend and strengthen and they dont theres not much u can do than to give up. For years we've wanted bigger signings breaking the wage strucutre but it has never happened. No manager wants to deal with that headache of not being funded by the owners. Theres no passion from the owners for the club its just a business for them.
Just want to say Thank You Jurgen, for everything you've done for the club I love. You will be hugely missed and i will always be proud you were our manager.  Always remember Jurgen that though you may leave You'll Never Walk Alone!!.....YNWA
Sold Coutinho and used the funds to sign Van Djik & Alison, signs Robertson for £8M, rebuilds a midfield over a summer for £170M. As a United fan Rebuild has always been the problem & Jurgen is the best rebuild coach the league has ever seen. ETH once said “all eras come to an end”, maybe time to bring his to an end and sign Jurgen. That’d probably mean as sour as a 22nd United league title to the scouse!
YNWA Jurgen. Danke
I'm not crying, you're crying.💔
Sad and Shocked but respect his decision. Life will go on and I'm sure everything will be put in place for whoever comes in. So let's all enjoy this Season and send Jurgen out the Best way possible..YNWA !
Klopp is Klopp  A honest good, man who everybody li to have friend like him. But this buddy will leave soon! Thank You Jürgen!🙏🙏🙏
Thank you klopp❤️
Whaaaaat???? Nooooooooo!!!!😫😭
Nuuuuuuu klopp noooooo😢😢😢😢😢
Uffffff.....
im fully support your decision. Actually i always afraid of your burnout. As you said, your managemnet style based on energy and its time to say goodbye.   Thanks for making my weekend excited about 10 years. Dont forget us.   your true fan. from South Korea
Pls get Xabi Alonso there's no one else to replace this man
he will use this fact for the motivation of players. what a manager
Hope xabi alonso gets job he’s got unfinished. Business.
I'm a Chelsea fan and I have nothing but respect for this man. Not only a world class manager, but a gent, entertainer and tactician who has injected more life and passion into the Prem than any other manager in recent times. Wish him all the best.
😢😢😢😢
@rajhoque2658 0 seconds ago A wise decision from a very wise man, an  awesome manager and a human being , life is short, the man chooses to live a little also , he needs his family time and make his life experiences. FROM A SPURS FAN ❤️
Interesting that this announcement comes now that Postegoglu is definitely set to usurp him & indeed all of the other Prem' managers (bar Pep, obviously). Doubt he'll qualify for Universal Credit though.
Sad watching this press conference. Klopp is a great converter fo Anfield. Hard to accept that you are leaving. A legend has made Anfield a great pitch. We love you and wish you all the best in your future undertakings. You are forever remembered.YNWA.
Hahahahahahahahahaahahahahahha
Love and thanks to you Jurgen for all you've done in bringing belief to all Liverpool Fans around the world.💕💕💕😙😚😣
It's a Sad Sad Sad day!
thank you for everything Jürgen❤️. wish you all the best in your next chapter. we were once doubters, but you turned us into believers. You’ll Never Walk Alone
The only man to ever break my heart 😢
Let us win the quadruple for him
Thank you Klopp for everything you have done for this club Liverpool from a Australia Liverpool supporter ❤
a shame but i suppose everything has a natural conclusion. good for him putting himself and his family first. well done fella, enjoy the rest of the season and enjoy a well earned break.
He is a better fit for LFC than Pep or any other manager.  Klopp’s teams have a far more entertaining style than Pep’s
The end era kloop
Thank you Jurgen for being the reds. Thank you for your love and energy that make our live brighter. YNWA from Jakarta, Indonesia
Klopp You’ll never walk alone
Win the Prem one more time and become immortal.
Thank you for all wonderful memories you have given me, you will always be my favorite manager.
nah i cant take this man
Well done jurgen you were colossal for Liverpool and will forever be ingrained in the clubs history as one of the Liverpool giant's
Give him a statue and name a section of a field the klopp end ❤️
1 Title isnt successful 😂 Fergie did that on his last year with Cleverly in midfield 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 In fact Fergies last 6 years had more than Triple the success Klopp had. Liverpool fans are hilarious
what a significant human being.... thank you for everything Jurgen...thank you....
Crying😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you somuch sir klopp. We will love you forever.
Nooooooo........ We got to do the Quad this season now.....
Vielen vielen Dank Jürgen. Hatte echt Tränen in den Augen. Du bist der größte Fussballtrainer der Welt. Nach VFB Stuttgart ist der FC Liverpool mein nächster Fanclub. Egal was du als nächstes macht, ich wünsche dir alles alles alles Gute Jürgen Klopp 👍
That hurts. Even for someone like me, who lives abroad and is not a Liverpool fan. What a legend Klopp is. He did everything right. In his unmistakable way - humble, honest, authentic, approachable, thoughtful, straight forward and always with the best results. My favourite football manager since the Mainz 05 days. We love you, Kloppo and we'll miss "the normal one" <3 i feel for all Liverpool fans today
Media have done this with all of the pressures
Thank you for everything gaffer 😭 ❤
thank you for everything. I hope, whoever comes in to replace you does your legacy justice.
“What I know definitely I will never ever manage a different club in England than Liverpool. 100%.” 🥲❤   One last ride. Let’s do this.
Lets win the Quad and give him the send off he deserves !
This can only motivate the players to win it all for klop
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
watch liverpool fight for this man and win the league 🤔 TACTICS
😢😢😢😢
Klop IS Liverpool, what a man. I'm not sure we can cope without this man at the helm, but if its the needed and right decision for him then more power to him! Go and enjoy your spoils of war!
One of THE Great managers. Great man. Sad loss for English football.
The greatest manager who has ever coached Liverpool. Your passion and legacy will remain in the atmosphere of Anfield, Jürgen👍 Al nassr fan.
Jürgen represents the Liverpool Spirit it will always be YNWA❤️
You did a great job we accept your call boss we will miss you ♥️♥️YOU WILL NAVER WALK ALONE🔥🔥🔥🔥
danke klopp
I would do anything to have him back 😢
A true legend, congratulations for your journey in Liverpool. Can you come and SAVE A.C Milan?!
I am not even Liverpool supporter but this hurts. Prem will never be the same.
Thank you Jürgen for everything. We should rebrand the Kop to the Klopp. It's easily deserved. I hope for the best for your future endeavours. ❤
Dont watch english football much, but damn i love this guy! Kudos to you Klopp!
It hurts🥺
Man, what a class act!  You will be missed!
He's one of the very best coaches in Europe and seems to be a wonderful person, too. I wish him the best. 9 years leading one of the top clubs is insanely stressful. Most Real Madrid coaches, for one,  can't stay over 3 years (and the last year is always challenging). He deserves a long vacation. From a distance (being a Madrid supporter) I've seen signs of tiredness in the last couple of years, but the work he's done at Liverpool is absolutely impressive. He will be remembered by Liverpool fans for generations. Best wishes and good luck for whatever the future might bring, Jurgen.
I want to get drunk because of this
I am really depressed from next season dk what to expect
Feel like crying 😭 YNWA klopp
Jurgen, thanks for everything you've done! You are the best!
Best PL manager since Jose
capek dia,, pemain2 incaranya ga dikasih
Thank you Klopp for everything you've achieved with Liverpool, you will be dearly missed. GOAT Manager. YNWA.
From a Gooner, massive respect to Klopp. He's been such a fantastic manager that everyone should look up to. He's really built your club up back to the level of it's past glories. Genuine fear every time we play you guys. Massive respect and all the best for his future. 🙏
I still can’t believe it but we have to respect the boss decision 😢
Your the best manager man
A true leader, just listening to this you can see why players would run through walls for him.
I can’t believe it manager, But I will support u forever Klopp. From South Korea
Klopp please come to Barca we badly need you ❤. You will always a best coach in premiere league. All the best for future ❤
Join barcelona please
🥺🥲😢😭
A Liverpool legend, surely. I think if he gets on TRT he'll be ready and able to coach on for at least 4 more years at Liverpool, since he alluded to tiredness and health issues.
U make a big man cry klopp😢
I came home from work to find my son looking at his phone and crying. What happened? I asked. Klopp quits Liverpool after the season. He replied. Now we're both looking at the phone and crying. Thanks for all the wonderful years, Mr. Normal one. YNWA from the Czech Republic.
Nooooo😢
What a great man and manager. We were lucky to have him and he broke the 30 year PL Title drought and brought our pride in the club back to its full capacity. He will be greatly missed by all the fans, the team and all the people who work at the club. Good luck to you Jurgen. I hope you find another great project to work on and thanks for letting us know you wouldn't manage another PL club. Maybe we'll see you managing Germany at the next World Cup. YNWA
I hope he can give me the EPL trophy, before he leaves.
Biggest managerial  disappointment for me since  King  Kenny resigned   ..bad timing for the announcement then again there's never a good time for something like this.....hopefully the Anfield powers  that be ,have been  on the phone to  Alonso  already..Still Klopp & the team will get 100%  support  ..however the season turns out
I'm a Real Madrid fan and in the last years we had great battles with Klopp and his team, I love him so much, a wonderful person and a historical coach!
YNWA
Danke, Jürgen.
YNWA <3
Klopp had a fall out with owners who didnt match his ambition any longer and he's being nice about it.
*"He made the people happy."*
from an arsenal fan,you have my respect sir.
Let's win the quadruple for kloppruple
This is the first manager have watched that has done such... I know there others but this one is so special and emotional for all the Liverpool FC fans... Klopp will always be a Red. YNWA
When I saw this I thought it was fake but then I realised it was real                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Goodbye Klopp YNWA❤❤❤❤🔴🔴🔴🔴you will always be a red
No, please, no !!! 😢😢 🙏
17:10
Every good news comes to an END !!
Nooooooooooooooooooo
Kloop N1🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
Thank you klopp for all you have done for us❤ YNWA.
😫😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I love the commenter that says "No matter where Klopp goes Klopp will always be Liverpool" I simply can't unsee "Klopp goes Klopp"! Pop goes the weasel, Klopp goes Klopp. The cat goes miaow, the dog goes woof, Klopp goes Klopp. I love that the commenter left out the comma there. Klopp, Klopp everyone! And thank you for a great, great job, liebe Herr Jűrgen Klopp. Vielen dank. Alles gute fűr die Zukunft.
Mr. Jurgen thank you for all the things you do to this club, i respect all your decision in this situation we always remember you in our entire life. Maybe this not moment we want but maybe it's good for you and Liverpool in the future. See you in another situation and I hope you're feeling better and better and remember You'll Never Walk Alone.
I am crying here for a manager cause his charisma is unmatched
Bayern better be quick this time
Completely gutted. But forever thankful to Jurgen.
Ynwa klopp. Thanks for being the best manager the world has ever seen 😢
Feel like I've been Kicked right in me Klipperty Klackers 😭💔
😢
OMG I have feared this day will come 😢. Thank you Jurgen Klopp for everything, wish you all the best ❤ Best manager ever YNWA ❤
Not a Liverpool fan but if you are going to bow out this is the classiest way to do it. Honest interview from Klopp.
No no nooooooooooo😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Arsenal fan here & i can feel the pain of the Liverpool fans. A good manager leaving on good will is some real pain. Mostly after getting you to top levels.
oh No! the best coach in the world is leaving us!!!
he is going to Barcelona 😒 or maybe Bayern after a little break ???
More to life than football. I’m not a liverpool fan but I will say this. I see the comments from city , Utd , and other rivals, thinking this is the end of Liverpool. I will say this. The next wave of super managers is approaching. Guardiola, klopp , mourinho , Ancelotti are now close to stopping if not have already. Liverpool have the next big one lined up which is colossal. This guy has worked with Benitez , mourinho , guardiola , Ancelotti and Klopp. He was a fantastic player winning champions leagues , la liga , bundersliga champions uefa cup champions euro champion ships, World Cup winner. His IQ on football is at genius level. And his name is Xabi Alonso. I would be wary of insulting Liverpool fans at this moment they are awaking a sleeping Giant.
I'm in absolute tatters😭 Thank you Jürgen, you meant the world to us and we'll miss you dearly. YNWA❤
THIS GUY MUST BE AN ALIEN  👽👾 😭😢 Thats it we are winning everything this season!!!
Germany National team by Klopp and Xabi Alonso come with us <3
Hard to process this, very sad but let's go out with a massive end to the season and send this iconic manager on his way!
❤
Whose gonna replace klopp😢
As a Barça fan, this huge me a lot😢. Thx for the unbelievable work you bring to this team 👏🏾 ❤
Leaving and might finish when the ovation is loud.
This is like Messi leaving Barcelona😢
hahahahaha  24 mins of saying im sick of living in Liverpool and want my tan topped up in the sun ! Dem teeth dont whiten themselves you know.. Not even a fan of a club in the prem so no bones, He was fun at the start, now not intersting and moans moans moans dulll dull dull champagne socialist
Im in tears you are my shankly
This is like losing a family member. Genuinely, a hero and role model in my life.  First of all, thank you for everything. Secondly, let's create those chapters and finish this time together the right way. YNWA.
My manager. My idol. Forever in my heart and my club.  You've nothing to worry about Jurgen. Nothing at all.  We love you.
Is this the time we welcome back Alonso?
What is this salty discharge coming out of my eyes?!
The best news I got in football was when Jurgen Klopp signed for Liverpool and now this is the saddest news I could ever take in football. I love Jurgen, we will miss you for sure!
I do not know you personally, but I feel your feeling here intimately when you stand at the pitch and managing the game. I love you really!
Greatest manager I've had in my 32 years of supporting this amazing football club. Massive love and appreciation for all you've done  and we'll do everything as fans to help push you and the players to make this final chapter at the club the best one yet. YNWA ❤️
Just like mane firmino fabinho hendo, klopp has won everything on offer he job is basically done. Before he came Liverpool had never won the league in this format (premier league) he won everything else available ironically the only thing you can say he didn't win was the Europa League the last time he was in it, maybe it's destiny Liverpool lift that trophy this season
You will always be missed, loved, and respected. YNWA
Top class manager one of the best
Barça Fan But Klopp leaving Liverpool 🥲 End of an Era and Pep Klopp Rivalry has come to an end
Jurden Klopp will never be forgotten as a valuable coach 😇😢👏Liverpool will always win inshallah😢💯✊️
A Jamais tu restera graver dans mon cœur ❤️
You can take the guy out of Liverpool, but you can’t take Liverpool out of the guy! ❤❤
oh no 😢
Absolutely gutted, what a manager he has been mastermind of the game and a principled supporter of the people, he had our backs now it's time we have his, thank you for the times Jurgen we will miss you, your a Liverpool legend for the rest of time YNWA ❤
I need a hug,this really broke my heart😢
Devastated,in tears
Ohh my god……
that's the first time im crying cause football. thnx coach 4 every thing's we gonna miss u YNWA
Growing up in the 90s I was always told what Liverpool was by my Dad. It was hard to see it.   Thank you Jurgen for making me see.
I'm completely speechles. Thank you for everything Jürgen
Thanks Jurgen YNWA
Great manager, full respect from a united fan 👏
😢😢😢😢
it was pleasure and a gift to see  your  Liverpool, Mr Klopp! Looking back for Sure we all can say it worth it. Thank you! ..from Estonia and Russia with respect to the Manager, Gentlemen, Boss!!!
Im crying😭😭😭😭😭
What a guy 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Thank you so much Jurgen, respect for you 😢😢
Thank you, Jurgen Klopp.   This is a huge, huge shock.
Thanks all about things Klopp!!! YNWA❤❤❤❤❤❤
Klopp & Liverpool was a perfect match. Thank you boss for all you've done. I hope you will leave in glory 🎉 YNWA !
Chapeau bas, Monsieur Klopp. Vous méritez une statue pour votre engagement envers le club.
That last game in Anfield will be fucking emotional.
You'll be missed, Jürgen! Absolute Liverpool legend! Thank you for everything you have made in the last 8 years and for bringing us back to the elite and for the days that will came. We're going to enjoy the rest of the season as a legend like you deserve.  YNWA!
It's SO OVER
Gutted, such a great human above all else.I Love that he mentions and remembers Daire, even in his leaving announcement everyone else is important to him.
I’m shocked right now but I appreciate everything that you have done to this club. I hope we can achieve the best while Klopp is still here. Danke Jurgen❤ @Liverpoolfc Make a statue for Klopp!!
Give this man his statue alongside bill and bob❤❤❤❤
As a united fan, I really appreciate this guy for the football he had liverpool play and everything he’s done for them
Love Klopp Button ~>
Like the Beatles, he has had a positive effect on thousands, if not millions, of people's lives. I have always admired his integrity and I guess it shouldn't be a surprise he chooses to leave in this way. I wish him and his family well for the future. By the way Jorgen IF you were to miss football at some point my club, Sunderland, could do with a sprinkling of your magic!!
YNWA KLOPP❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm sure he said when he came he was looking to retire in ten years. Yes he signed a new contract but that means nothing. I do find it strange that this has come out within a day or so of a rumoured tv programme on lfc which he previously did not approve of.
He make liverpool team so good no manager like him we will get in liverpool no good 😢😢😢.now man city will be happy
I’m happy that he’s leaving on his own accord , rather than seeing him inevitably being drained and performances dipping and people call him to quit . Legend for all he is and stands for and for what he’s done in these years ! God bless ! 😢❤
What a surprise to me,  feel so sad to hear that u will be leaving the club 😢💔 hope u the best wishes for the rest of your life sir & ♥️ unwa 👏🙏
Now I have absolutely no doubts that we have bagged the Title this Year. We will always love you Klopp. You are Class. Amazing Human Being.
I can't believe Klopp is leaving Liverpool this season, but in my opinion, you are the best Liverpool manager for me, YNWA!
Gerrard licking his lips right now
Love you sir thanks for everything ❤
😢Thanks and Best wishes, one of the greatest coaches of LFC, YNWA
He had to say it to avoid leaks, which would destabilise the team.  Sad as it is, thank you very much, coach. Always will have a place in our hearts.
He said ‘nobody noticed’ but I could see some signs that something was different and I was worried something might be wrong. Tragic news, how can we replace the irreplaceable😢
Thank you ❤klopp for everything
BUILD A STATUE RIGHT NOW !! THIS GERMAN MAN IS A LVING LEGEND, CANT BELIEVE THIS HAS HAPPENED, I WANT TO FLY TO YOU
My hero <3 i can only thank you and wish you the best in your life YNWA
One of the best coaches in history and will be missed
Noooooooo
Tottenham supporter here... Loved him in the Bundesliga, loved him at Liverpool... I'll never forget the countless sports channels and journalysts saying "If this team was managed by Klopp it would be..." ... This man has been a reference for QUALITY, CLASS and PASSION for all these years... He'll never walk alone...
Saddest news, hope the lads say goodbye their boss by winning every trophies. YNWA❤❤❤
Alonso to be the LFC manager
👑❤
oh fcckk im crying 😢
YNWA
Man Utd fan here - Absolute respect for Klopp, he's one of the greats that the Premier League has seen. His passion for the club has always been there and he's turned Liverpool into a team that wins things again. It goes without saying that Liverpool will have some pretty large shoes to fill.
We always knew this day would come, still massively gutted.
The most lovable manager, w’ell miss you definitely ❤
No ! You cant go !!
Best manager this club has ever seen ♥️
Crying
This is Liverpool last dance .. come on Liverpool win the title
Egal, was jetzt kommt: Nur das Beste für dich, Kloppo! ❤🤍
Am gutted but respect his decision. Thanks for all the memories. To soften his departure somewhat,maybe Alonso to take his place but thats for another day I guess.
I guess you could say that he simply wants to "Walk Alone" for a while.  I'm sure that without ManCity cheating he would have a few more league titles.
The love I have for him I even call him uncle Klopp ❤
Legend ❤️
Heartbreaking news
My question is who can be the right manager for Liverpool like klopp was
No way😢
now y’all will understand the pain of us dortmund fans
Its the saddest day for me as a Liverpool supporter. Can’t just digest it. Plz Kloppo nooooo
A match made in heaven. The perfect man for the job. An elite coach and even better human being. There will never be another Jurgen Klopp.   Anfield, the travelling away fans, everyone all over the globe will show how much he means to our supporters from now until the end. Thank you Kloppo, YNWA❤
yeah.... i can't
Klopp you have been the best manager for a long time and Thank you for everything,We knew you was gonna be gone one day just not this soon,But yeh...We defo need to win the Prem,F.A Cup,Carabao and Europa now,I hope Pep takes over......But yeh im speechless...Klopp YNWA
Klopp has been and will be a god like figure at Liverpool. Can’t say much more.
ชีวิตต้องก้าวเดินต่อไป แต่คุณไม่มีวันเดินเดียวดายแน่นอน รักคุณตลอดไป Jürgen Klopp❤
Difficult to accept it 💔 Will miss u klopp thank you for everything lots of love ❤
Thank you Jurgen
This man needs a statue next to shankley. Forever our manager. YNWA Jurgen ❤
The lads are going to have to give everything that they have from here until the end of the season now. Absolutely everything because this is it. There will be no more chances to win the PL, as long as Pep and City are there.
❤
He will be back one day i believe it 😢
I woke up to this 😢
Assuuuuuu Assuuuuuuu💔💔💔💔
Klopp has re-energised us, just to give someone else to undo his work😔
Chelsea fan here. Klopp is exceptional character first of all. The whole Premier League will miss him dearly. Wish you all the best and you will be missed here
Thanks for everything you have done for LFC ❤
saddest day in my football life 😢
No matter how the season end. No matter if Liverpool wins a quadruple,  this season will be a very sad one. Jurgen, you will be missed!❤️❤️
Pls win the Premier League for him.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Thank you for being LFC coach and all your contribution to the team
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Absolute LEGEND! Thank you for everything!!! Will be missed hugely! I think players and everybody should pull themselves together to win a much as possible this season. Letsgoooooo!
This is the end of an era. For the first time in my life of supporting liverpool since 1991 I felt we could win the league every season klopp was in charge and we  played like it . I think we will now drift back down to where we were before 5th -6th-7th  and I never thought klopp would leave in this way I wish he could have announced it when the season ended as there's still alot to play for and I feel this will affect our players but I hope klopp will be remembered as much as Shankly / paisley/ Dalglish  as he is a true legend thank you klopp for everything and thank you to the staff as well we were blessed
Wonderful manager and an even better man , so thankful for the years you gave to our club , Wishing the absolute very best , good health and happiness to Jurgen and his loved ones. One thing for sure is ❤YNWA❤.
Come to Barca
YNWA
Absolutely devastated. Let's hope the boys proper push for the rest of the season and grab a couple trophies for him
No Liverpool fan but I am a fan of football and Jurgen Klopp is one of the best of the best.  I don’t know him personally but his personality seems top tier too. What he did for Sven recently is amazing.  Good luck coach
😢
See me crying.. You made me love football with passion😢
Exhaustion gets to everyone at some point.  Best of luck to him.  He's done a fantastic job. I wonder if Klopp has already identified and recommended his successor. Interesting.  Walk on. The club is bigger than everything and everyone.
i cannot believe not having klopp next season onwards...i just cant!!!
Ywna klopp
Forever in our hearts! What a guy.
Bellingham crying

Mark my words: Xabi Alonso is a perfect candidate
Liverpool will win the league now😢
Liver pool  fan    will  remember  u
He was made for liverpool no other manager suited us more
If he leave we can't find manager like him dam no good
YNWA ❤
Firstly, mad respect for you Klopp, you put us back on top made us be feared in the league again gave us our image back. Secondly, all the best to him I hope he’s well and continues to be healthy. Thirdly, to go the distance against city year after year sometimes only losing by a point when in other seasons that would have been a title win massive respect for him he’s got to go down as one of the all time greatest mangers in the game, they say you’re never remembered for finishing second but he will be because that’s how good he is.   Also never managing a club in England again-so much respect from that you’ll always be remembered here, Jurgen YNWA ❤️
such humility, sign of a great leader. He will be missed.
I dont know why am crying coz he was the best for liverpool and he woll ever be the best 😢 please dont leave our klopppp❤
We respect your decision. But we are very sorry. Together we will create legends for the rest of the season.
😭😭😭 we love you so much klopp,, your the best coach 😢😢❤❤❤❤
damn that fucking sucks
So Sad 😭😭😭 but i will Always for Liverpool FC fan ❤❤❤❤
Klopp is Liverpool and Liverpool is Klopp ❤😞
forever liverpool legend ❤️
Good Man, Good message.  I totally understand what his decision is.  Energy is not only provided by food etc its your life force energy.  This is a alien concept in Western world, but that is EXACTLY what he is explaining here if you look closer.  LCFC fan, good luck Klopp in whatever you do once your finished your season.
Klopp is always a Liverpool fn
Great news for man u
I'm a Leeds fan and this is a shock. What a great manager who will be missed in this country. All the best though. You have been a breath of fresh air.
A legend in his own right. It is a great loss for Liverpool and a greater loss for the premier league. He will forever live in the hearts of the kopites. Thank you Jurgan!  Y N W A
Our german scouser 🇩🇪❤️YNWA
Klopp, thank you for your contribution. Respect your decision. Please continue your work in the last few months and enjoy your works in these months.
Respect Boss, you'll never walk alone and always be in my heart forever!
Lets win the premier league for him 💪💪💪
After this season I hope that you take some time for yourself and your family and thank you for everything that you have done for liverpool fc, ynwa
i love u so much jurgen!!!!
Not the right time to announce  you're  leaving big mistake .Should  have done it at the end of the season .Liverpool will go downhil this season now
Fantastic manager sad loos for the team from a Wolves fan
Liverpool are our rivals. But these are the moments i got to put the rivalry aside. As rivals i am happy he's leaving, but as a football fan this came out of nowhere. Klopp seems one of those guys who's not just a good coach but also a nice guy and a mentor. I wish him a good break.
Completely heartbroken! But I want all the best in life for this man! You have made all Liverpool fans feel so extremely proud of being a part of an incredible journey! We all love you Jürgen!
Jurgen, thank you for some amazing times and a few more hopefully YNWA
😢😢😢
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
I think we all understand jurgen, you want and need a break. Your mentally exhausted from the huge amount of responsibility you carry.  go relax lad, look after your family and partner, You deserve it
Come back any time. YNWA
We have to win the league now. That's the only thing that will cheer me up after this news. Rocked my world. Ynwa Jurgen
The only man who can replace Klopp is Guardiola. That isn't happening for sure. 😢 Will forever be a Legend of The Game! The boys must win everything this season! 🔥👊🏻
Klopp widow button
แด่ความทรงจำ..บอสทำให้ลิเวอร์พูลยิ่งใหญ่ จนทุกวันนี้..
YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE ❤😢😔🔴
To day is  1Apr 24
Take care of yourself Jürgen. Nothing more important than your own mental health, and it’s imperative that no one let’s work push them beyond their mental stamina. Let’s end it with some trophies. YNWA ❤️❤️❤️
A real Liverpool legend, won it all with us and hopefully still more to come. God bless you Jürgen Klopp
Villa fan hands down best manager I seen especially going against a team like City with endless wealth
OH NO I am life  long Liverpool fan I am in shock to hear this Klopp to leave LFC he is irreplaceable. We all knew he would leave at some point but in SHOCK. Klopp thank you for all you done for US
Great guy. He’s exhausted bless him. Back to Dortmund after a break maybe.
😢
He's going to be a big loss, almost impossible to replace. He's our club through and through and he's given his all.  Thankyou Jürgen.YNWA
When Ted Lasso gets desperate, he watches Jürgen Klopp.
Thank you Klopp for everything. YNWA ❤️
😢❤️
I am a Japanese Liverpool fan. This is really shocking news. I loved Klopp's football. Thank you for all the courage and inspiration you have given me!
Wow I feel numb
My manager, ❤❤
I am crying, miss u so much
Since the day he was signed, I knew this Day will come when, what a legend he is really
The best manager there ever was. Liverpool won't be the same anymore😢
The end of an era
If he is doing it for his own wellbeing and just wants a break then I respect that but if he shows up managing Germany at the Euro's then his legacy and reputation will be tarnished,but we all know the truth really,he can't take another year of listening to the mega annoying Scouse accents😂
What a rebrand he did. Thanks for the memories after this season.
German job
Massive respect for this guy. He played the role wenger played during the SAF dominant Era.
Thank you for everything Klopp. You'll be missed but You'll never walk alone ❤🤍
As a Dortmund guy I feel with you Liverpool. I´m sure thousands of others do too. Best manager ever.
Klopp is irreplaceable
Whatttttt
Kloop you are a legend no matter what you will be one of the best of the best ever Liverpool ever have YNWA KLOOP
Thank you Jürgen for all the Memories you brought to me/us Liverpool Supporters! So Much Passion and Love for the Club!  Who Thought a great man from Germany with the Surname Klopp would his name be sang by at the Kopp! Always meant to be! Danke Her Klopp! ❤YNWA A Legend Forever!
As a spurs supporter I wish him all the best.. he is one the managers that I respect a lot.. speaks with his heart..
What a sad news ! YNWA Jürgen
Gutted just love him and his presence in football makes it better
Now you know how the BVB family felt....much love from dortmund  YNWA :)
YNWA
We have only just got into talking about the mental state of players. Well, perhaps that talk needs to be done for managers too. They clearly work too many hours. Maybe there needs to be a change in how a club is run, what the manager actually does.
Woah! I thought this was a joke! Liverpool will never be the same without Jurgen, I wish him all the best from here
Jurgen, you have not only given me the best times of my life but have fulfilled bucket lists for the people I have lost. Your legacy and story will go down with Shankley and Paisley and you will be my story I will tell my grandchildren. You have not only revived a club but a city and the fact that you will leave this way out of a selfless love of my club, only goes to show how good a man you truly are. All i ask is that you forgive the fans for chanting your name in the next game, and that we can have a proper send off at the end.  I hope you become the man, husband, father and grandfather you want to be. But always know you and the whole family will always have a home in our rainy corner of England.  At times you have made more people than you will ever know, know that they Will Never Walk Alone. I hope even when you are worried and stressed in the future you will always know You Will Never Walk Alone.
Our best manager since Bob Paisly
Jurgen, Thank you for all these amazing memories, titles and moments of joy you and your management team has given us! You'll have my eternal gratitude for that. Through the ups and downs, i knew we would always bounce back.   You'll Never Walk Alone, Jurgen. Thank you for everything and lets go for the quadruple!
End of an era...
Very heartbreaking💔
What do you think where he goes?
It was never going to last forever as much as we all wanted it to, this man brought so much joy to all of us for the past 8 years and we have to make sure he leaves knowing how much he meant. YNWA ❤😢
Life goes on nothing stays the same forever. Wat to do😢
❤❤❤
Absolute Legend! He has Allways been one thousand miles a hour. I truly hope he finds his peace and happiness. He certainly deserves it. Thank you Mr Klopp. We will never forget what you did for our Beloved Liverpool FC.
We will miss you 😢
YNWA Klopp... U will be always in our heart.. No matter where you go...
I thought this was a joke. Found out he was leaving through the title and it came as a shock. I knew this day was coming but didn’t expect it to come so quick
Very sad to see him go.. owners haven’t backed him up as much , he deserves that extra push for world class player signings
หวังว่าพ่อจะ คว้า4แชมป์ไว้ให้นะนี่นะ..
The question is who replaces him.  As a Spurs fan I am worried.
Am literally crying😢, I can't believe this. You're Loved❤🎉
We love you Jürgen YNWA thank you for everything ❤️❤️❤️.
Thank you Jurgen... you were the one who gave everything for the club since i started supporting Liverpool. You were the energy/spirits/power of the whole group. You were the one who tell me that giving up is not an options. You had raise me up time by time.  Klopp You will never walk alone-
Sad, before or later, it had to happen... YNWA
Come on xabi alonso😎
Kloop can do whatever he wants
It might be somehow possible to replace Jurgen Klopp the manager, but it will be impossible to replace Klopp the man.
I am amazed at the number of fans in the comments, from other great clubs.Respect for putting your allegiance  aside and recognising what he has achieved as a manager in the most competitve league in the world.
As Spurs I'm shocked and sad
Get down the bookies for Liverpool to win the league now lol 😂
How you gon tell us you're not the right one for the future??@@   Who told you that???? 😫😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭
Mark my words, Jurgen to the national team 🇩🇪
Took me a while to realise this was real.
Take Van Big Dijk with you, Klopp. You love Van Big Dik so much. You both deserve to leave soon. Van Big Dik the cinderella is a real problem for Liverpool now. Take him with you!
YNWA
Why Jurgen? why ?
Speak for myself its very very sad but i  accept this decision
As a United fan I can’t lie and say I’m not sad to see him leave ..great personality and great legendary manager salute klop
😢😢💔thank you boss  for everything ynwa ❤
Came in won it all. LEGEND. 🔴🔴🔴🔴
The greatest manager we ever got in our history 😢. We'll miss you. YNWA
I appreciate everything you have done for the club and the fans.....In my opinion this announcement is bad timing considering the fact that we are on course for the second PL trophy. It might be demotivating to the boys at this critical moment....
Broke the 30 year title drought and leaves the Club in fantastic shape...a job well done...Thanks
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭no😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢
Our heart forever ❤
This whole explanation of why, no klopp you didn’t owe us that but you’re just such a legend that you couldn’t leave us without one. From the bottom of my heart thank you. We truly didn’t deserve this man, it’s been such an honour, you made doubters into believers and have given me reason to keep going at times. You will never be far klopp and you’ll never walk alone. Bosstha 🥹♥️
Legend
Thank you for everything you have given and can still give to us. You taught us to believe that nothing is impossible. Thank you very much for all the emotions you gave. There are not enough words to describe our love for you. we will never forget your contribution to our history and you will always be in our hearts! P.s. The season is not over yet, so we are with you until the end and believe in your success. YNWA❤
We will miss you Jürgen, thank you for all the joy you brought to the club. YNWA
THANK YOU KLOPP, YOU DESERVE A REST, YNWA, YOU'LL BE ON OUR HEART FOREVER
In the end football is more than a sport. It is a unity that can even make pause in wars and antagonism between clubs and countries. Seeing so many fans from different clubs that comes and gives Klopp grace and respekt, shows that in the end we are ALL the same no matter what club we love.
แด่พ่อของแฟนๆลิเวอร์พูล รุ่นลูก
And IiiiiiIIiiIIiiIi will always love you...
It's gonna be hard not seeing this man on the sideline, absolutely gutted. However, then man sounds like he just wants to have a normal life, and there ain't a damn thing worng with that. Big respect!!
Thanks for everything Jurgen
Что блять происходит?!
Thanks for all the memories YNWA
Take a year off Jurgen and come back
This shocking to Football , will it be Barca or Real next for him ?
Thank you so so much Mr Jurgen Klopp for everything you  have done for our club and city you have gave me the best time ever as a Liverpool supporter and scouser I wish you the best and rest easy with your family 1 of a kind Thank you 🙏 ❤
Fair play. Have a lot of respect for Jurgen Klopp & this explanation as to why he’s leaving LFC is honest and refreshing.   Good luck and enjoy your new sports car, be sure to keep the tank full x
Thank You from the bottom of my heart...I dont have words to say ...just a love for you and a big big big thank you
Shock  I cried a bit and then thought “I have nothing but love for this man. Let’s enjoy him while we can”.
I really hate hearing this, I started crying💔
I hope he wins the Quadruple this season
Total integrity - best to announce it like he has, with total honesty. If he doesn't have the energy, he needs to do the right thing. It is a mammoth job. I think the boys will play harder than ever right to the end of the season. We'll miss him terribly. He is a legend. X
I'm Very heartbroken due to the news  Klopp is a Legend in my book you won us Every single trophies  now we need a Jurgen Klopp statue
Thank you Jurgen for all you've done for me as a fan and suppporter, as well as the amazing work you've done for our club. YNWA!!! Legend!
Being emotional I hate to see him leaving, however he's doing the right thing. He needs to walk out honored and chase a new dream. It's good for him and liverpool the transition is imminent anyway and people who love Klopp will always follow him where he goes. LIVERPOOL has enough time now to find the best replacement.   Towards the end of the interview I want to say "Klopp, you're a living legend and I really admire your character." I definitely wish you all the best from my heart. You really touched thousands of hearts around the world.
Total respect for a very intelligent man.
My god, this man is SO solid, honest and respectful. Thanks mate, for everything. This from a 62 year-old who's seen some greats at Liiverpool. Your place will be there, in the same cabinet.
1 year sabbatical then
watch jose mourinio take over
Loserpool will win the PL again after 60 years when he leaves. Hopefully he will manage the Mannschaft. Delusional fans wanted him out. Now, he bowed out like a super star. He came, he conquered. Loserpoll will walk alone.
Jurgen, thank you for everything you've done for the Liverpool FC!
START BUILDING THE STATUE RIGHT NOW!! I love this man and I'm so sad to see him go
from doubters to believers ❤
8 years at Liverpool: 1 PL, 1 FA Cup, 1 League Cup and 1 CL. The results in England for those many years are quite deflating for such a big club but he did win them the CL and that makes him a legend forever.
Right decision, stop at the top, leaveing the club in a good place.
Klopp, wherever you go, remember us. Remember Liverpool. You are Liverpool. ❤ You'll never walk alone.
This is the biggest heartbreak I’ve ever gone through 😭💔 thanks for all the amazing memories Klopp, one of the greatest managers and stories there’s ever been
He mentioned Dara 😭😭😭
I REMEBER YOUR FIRST SEASON BOSS.   i support chelsea but watching liverpool play was amazing during their prime season. Good job Klopp. Legend
I never expected this early.. I thought he would be here for another 2-3 season.. This breaks my heart.
YNWA ❤️
아 씨발 안돼....
Anyone else shed a few 😢? This mans energy in contagious and he is the hearts of all us fans
How many girls broke up with me when I was in highschool and no one made me cry. This has me bawling like I were a baby.  Thank you for everything, Jurgen. You gave absolutely nothing but joy for this club. You deserve to take a break and enjoy some time out of football with your love ones.
We will miss klop,though i'm a utd fan
World class man, not a bad manager either YNWA❤
Pep Lijnders as the next manager? Back to the old Boot Room days, if so.
Thank you Kloppo......  Lfc, we go again. 🎉
We don't want you to leave Jurgen! What if you got some more staff to hel! Don't go!
What a legend. Great interview. Shocked and sadness I feel but not surprised. I blame the English media with some of there most exhausting stupid questions in press conferences to the massive massive fixture list. Respect to the man. I wish him all the best and good health for the future. Would love to see him win one more league title in front our fans. That would be class. The other 3 cups would be an awesome bonus.
!!!!!!! NO!!! GOING TO MISS YOU  SAD!!!! DAY!!!! Im going out to get pissed! YNWA JK❤
I get it he is leaving a legacy of winning he doesn't want to taint that by over staying like Arsene Wenger's reign at Arsenal we love you klopp im sad to see you go YNWA 😢
Cant believe this is happening 😢😢
Просто скажу. Спасибо. Сделай перерыв, возглавь Германию, выйграй чемпионат мира и Европы и обратно домой. Мы будем ждать:)
Thank you for everything Jürgen. You'll forever be a Liverpool FC legend. All the best to you and your family.
Unreal
As a united fan i am so sad to hear that what he achived for the club is crazy ! I hope the best for him what a legend. No metter whenre he goes when he goes klop will always be liverpool
Thanks for everything Jurgen. You'll truly be missed.
Ada masalah apa bos??? Bukankah kita menginginkan treble winner 😭😭😭😭
Love ya boss! Heads up, let's give em hell for the rest of the season!
Everything Broken😢
Great Manager, Great Man.
I’m devastated you’re going, but I can totally respect your decision, and words can’t describe how thankful I am for everything you’ve done for the club, you’re my generations Shankly. I’m so glad Jurgen is Red. Thank you ❤❤
Turned us all from doubters to believers…Thanks normal one🥲
Catching me off guard on a random Friday with this sudden news!😭 Klopp is just human, after all. I hope he continues his great energy for Liverpool and lives his best life afterward.  He deserves the world for what he has done for the club to date! Hope the fans will respect his earnest wishes for the rest of the season 🙏   YNWA! ❤.❤
Hello Bayern Munich. The EPL won't be the same without you
Thank you for everything Jürgen! You leave as a legend!❤
I hate u from now on, Jürgen 😢
YNWA Mr Kloop 👍🙏
Build the man a statue and get a sculptor who can capture that grin.  An absolute legend.
Always be a Legend. Pleasure and Privilege to have you as our Boss for 8 years ❤ YNWA
They have to win this for him ❤
Thank you Jurgen 👏
Absolutely Gutted. Thats all i can say.
😢
Devastated. Nothing more to say.
Is this a prank ?
Gutted can't even describe how I feel and that we had no fans in that title season only make me want this one more please lads do it for the BOSS!!!!❤
First of all thanks you Jürgen for all of it, fall in love in your style of football since Dortmund. But I still have the feeling the owners are too blame here a bit too, No Invests and maybe wanne join the super league again. Musst bei exausting challeging cheaters every year without much help from the owners
Don't go
King Klopp! I’m forever grateful as a Red for what you’ve done for this club❤️
I wasn't the Liverpool fan before Klopp now that he's leaving I'm heart broken 💔  Good luck Coach and Thank You🙏
As a Liverpool fan from Croatia, thank you for everything Jurgen, YNWA❤
Ynwa
Nah man jurgen pls don’t am going to cry pls we love you pls ❤😢we will love you always u will never walk alone we will always be with you
This is what it must feel like to be on the end of an RKO out of nowhere. Absolutely gutted 😢
I feel really sad
Jurgen Klopp 😭
Forever grateful for this man!
I really hope this doesn't affect the rest of our season, klopp we accept your decision boss but I'm absolutely devastated your leaving 😢😢 YNWA BOSS ❤
Supporter from Thailand, we were changed from doubters to believers JK. Love you we do.
YNWA ❤
Football will never be the same, how will anyone ever live up to Klopp
It's hard to think of the team and the players without Klopp!!! We'll miss him!!!
Thank you for EVERYTHING you’ve ever done for this club Klopp, watching this was heart breaking you’ll always be a big part of of our lives and how Liverpool’s changed everyone’s life and my life.
He is normal, Thankyou for your dedication, loyalty & love for the club. YNWA
Those tickets to the last PL game of the season at Anfield suddenly became very special to me 🥹🥲
YNWA BOSS
I anticipated this moment. Hopefully, we can secure another Premier League trophy this season. Your contributions deserve a statue more than anyone else for this club
As a culè iam actually heart broken .. this guy did everything for the club but i do wish him the best
Dear sir,thank you for everything.
why😢
This club will go on but Life will be different without Klopp😢 YNWA
Proper gutted! 😢
Always leave the stage when the ovation is loudest! Klopp has seen the handwriting on the wall and decided to jump ship before he is kicked out under a cloud!He is doing a Zidane move after watching what has happened to Mourinho lately and Benitez for some years!It may be hard for Klopp to get this kind of support or set up anywhere else! Bayern will be a pressure cooker if he goes there!😊
If this man doesn’t get a statue I’ll stop being a Liverpool fan the best manager the prem has seen and YNWA❤❤
Thank you Jurgen for everything you have done for this club and its supporters you will be remembered always YNWA ❤
I've been a Liverpool fan for a very long time, and this hurts as much as the day King Kenny hung up his boots. 😪
"My biggest skill is common sense. I understand life", Jurgen Klopp 😢😢😢
I had supported Liverpool during 2021-22 season and they won both the League Cup and FA Cup thank to defeat against Chelsea in the penalty shootout.  Unfortunately, I was shocking to annouce that Jurgen Klopp will step down as a manager of Liverpool after 9 years, but I'm going to miss him soon after this English football season end. Thank you very much.❤
Respect for Klopp. You can only compete against cheaters for so long.
😢😢😢😢 Worst then any breakup I ever had
Massive love ❤️ for you Mr Klopp Thank you 🙏 for all you do!
The man, the myth, the legend... you shall really never walk alone!
Absolutely shock 😢
This hurts, but I want what's best for Jürgen. He will have our love and unconditional support forever. YNWA❤
Big love as a Spurs fan! His legacy will be legendary
Just speechless..........😮
Very grateful for the years he’s given the club. Thank you for all your hard work over the years, Jurgen! YNWA
No one can replace your place in the club and in our hearts. I will be forever grateful that you are Red
Wow I’m incredibly sad! Thank you for everything Klopp 🙏
A class act, like no other. Klopp has enhanced the quality of the Premier League, on so many levels. Best of luck for future endeavours, Jürgen. From a City fan. CTID.
Kill me
A EPL trophy in this end of the season will be the greatest good bye gift for klop and liverpool
I never really knew a Liverpool manager other than Klopp at the helm, so this is heartbreaking and a massive shock. But I have to come to terms with it. What a run we had.
aw shucks :(
I wll always walk with you klopp ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ you never walk alone jurgen  we miss you 💪
City fan but much respect for Klopp 🫡 Liverpool are 100% winning the league, feels likely
we can't let u go kloop
Oh my heart my soul… thank you boss
Huge news.
❤ Klopp we love you. Thanks 4 everthing ❤ From Mz
Absolutely legendary ..not the best tactically but he's the best at inspiring performances .and bringing everyone together
A superb manager, a superb human being...
Danke für alles Jürgmeister ❤🇩🇪 Doubters to believers
Hopefully we will be able to get 2-3 trophies for him this season. It will be legendary. 😢
Great interview. Really honest and heart felt. Well done Juergen.
Welp Liverpool is fucked
Crying 😢  I’m an American and this man is one of the biggest reasons I fell in love with the beautiful game of football and of course Liverpool FC Thank you for everything Jurgen ❤️❤️❤️
I’m a Japanese guy.🇯🇵 You brought up Endo and Minamino at Liverpool. However, that is not why I love this club. It’s your hands-on football and aggressive tactics made me do it. When I heard this news, I could not hide my surprise. Wherever you go, whatever you do from now on, I thank you and will continue to support you. With six months to go, let’s make sure we win!! 🟥“YOU’LL NEVER WALK ALONE”🟥
Classic manager  You don’t know how much you have inspired my life
Thanks for some of the best memories ever boss ❤️
Let us win everything this season   Let us make Anfield a living hell for the opponents for the remainder of the season
Noooooooo😢
Oh nooooo !!!
Respect Jurgen, you will always be my GREATEST EVER LIVERPOOL MANAGER, let's make this season the fairytale ending you deserve, LOVE ALWAYS 👏 👏 ♥
❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you very much for your contributions and memories. You will always be a LEGEND. wish your family and you the very best! Well deserved. Take care, to good health and happiness
감독님 그리울 거에요 감사하고 사랑합니다.
Klopp done seeing Xabi Alonso and don't want Liverpool to miss out on him, this man is truly a legend of the game. Respect and love❤ -Man Utd fan
"It's not so important what people think when you come in, it's what people think when you leave." - Jürgen Klopp (2015)  You came as the "Normal One" and leave this club as the "Beloved One". YNWA ❤
Klopp is Liverpool whatever happens. An absolute legend of the club, best manager in the world as things stand as far as I see. Let's go out there and win everything we can for the rest of the season and end on a really positive note. YNWA Kloppo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jürgen! YNWA
😔😔😔
Thank you klopp
No wayy😭😭
The fa need to get him as the new england manager
YNWA ❤
Ma mind is in disbelief! This man has been in the club for so long it felt like he was Liverpool and would never leave and this a United fan speaking
Ynwa klopp❤️
On behalf of I'm sure ALL Bolton Wanderers fans...thankyou for being Englands favourite German.  You have gained the respect of millions.
Ffs, sth would have happen to trigger that.   Everyone feels tired at work, at some point, we want to resign but to resign when everything is at its best status as it can be…
coaching at Sunday League level is taxing enough, cannot even begin to imagine the toll on these managers at the very highest level!  I believe Ange mentioned it yesterday in his presser that even the very best players and managers all eventually move on... still shocks you though when it breaks the news, particularly for a longstanding and successful manager like Jurgen. A legend departs.
🥹❤ 🏆🥇🔥 YNWA
Will be sorely missed
Absolutely gutted. But can't question the guys judgment when it comes to football, and need to trust this is right here too
People will say traitor i will say legend! so sad to see him go lets win it all in his last season.
a special man, a special manager and a special human being. thank you for the 9 amazing years, crazy to think that we won everything under him. he deserve a statue at anfield. Thank you for everything and YNWA Mr Jurgen Klopp🫡
well f@&k...  😕
Walk on... Walk on... In your hearts... You'll neeeeevvverrr walk allllloooonnneeeee❤️
Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, YNWA ❤ 🥲
I am not a Liverpool fan but I really like Klopp and Liverpool together and makes this decision me sad. Respect for Klopp to make this hard decision! All the best for him in the future! I am sure and hope we will hear from him in the future. He is a great character of the international football. Please come to Arsenal one time... ;) Go Klopp! Go Szoboszlai!  Go Gunners!
Gutted
😭😭😭😭😭THANK YOU FOR THE MEMORIES BOSS
Forever a Legend in our Club❤❤❤
To be honest, yes we had a bad season... but I saw it his energy level had dropped..  he wasn't shouting at the players like he used... which this season has changed his energy level is up there... and for what is worth he is right to go out this way... the club wasn't going to sack him even if we get relegated... what he has done for this club is huge and leaving it after rebuilding it... you can understand his decision to leave  now. Leave the club in good state
YNWA BOSS. Thx for everything❤💚🙏. I'm still shocked cant process it as full for now
How poetic would it be if we won the quadruple in Jürgen's final season...
Thank you for everything and please win the title!
Legend.. you'll never walk alone.. We trust in Klopps❤❤❤
💔💔💔
Bayern and now liverpool facing a consistent manager next season,and both admire alonso
Bro I’m legit crying 😭😭😭  We will always love you Jurgen ❤
You'll Never Walk Alone ♥
You'll Never Walk Alone, Jürgen. I'm lost for words, a true Liverpool Legend.
Quick 9 years what a time in the prem
"We have to turn doubters into believers" - 2015  We're on for the quad... again. - 2024  You did everything you promised and more - Thank you Jürgen.
In fuhrer we trust , get him a statue asap
I'm gonna go cry now. Thank you Jürgen, for everything.
Thanks for the beautiful memories Boss😊
What are we going to do
No, Please.
I know it's not a very good news but I completely understand why. The love we have towards you will never disappear 😢
For his health is the only reason I can understand and accept fully. There was never another way I could´ve understood. YNWA Jurgen. You are the only Liverpool manager i´ve known and a massive part of my love for football. Thank you.
I'm not crying, you are crying 😐
I think he has made two mistakes  and they are he is leaving one year to early,with man city likely to be out of the picture next season Liverpool would probably walk to the title and secondly announcing your departure early always unsettles the players and never ends well.
Plz klopp stay with us ❤
Feels like my misses of 10 years is leaving☹️ who tf gone replace klopp
I'm heartbroken right but at the same time I can understand nothing lasts forever but the memories Klopp has given LFC will always be memorable to me all the the ups and downs. So Thank You Jurgen for Everything. Thank you for giving this Generation of Liverpool fans the feeling of having a manager that is comparable to the heights that manager's such as Bill Shankley and Bob Paisley have given to LFC who I only heard about either from older LFC fans or from social media but never got to witness personally.
So gutted it hurts will go down as a legend and rightly so should be spoken about with the likes of paisley, shanks and dalglish
Build him a statue beside Bill Shankly
As an Arsenal fan, I have a lot of respect for what Klopp has done. How he transformed the team into what it is today it’s just incredible.    My brother is a huge Liverpool supporter, and one thing I could say is that Klopp has 100% brought joy to him and to the millions of Liverpool fans around the world. His “Heavy Metal” style of football is just a pleasure to watch.   No matter how the season ends, he will always be a Liverpool legend. Hopefully Liverpool could win a domestic trophy, and the Europa League this season.
Klopp, bester Mann was du mit Liverpool und Dortmund erreicht hast. Hast dir deinen Ruhestand mehr als verdient
The worse news I’ve woken up to I’m not ready to hear this …….
Looks like he will take over the german national team! What do you think guys?
We accept ♥️
I'm literally crying omgod 😭
still in shock but i accepted you reason Jurgen. Life is more than just football. Be happy my idol. You deserves a good life.
I already miss him
Oh my god this day has come :( nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ...LFC Monument...not just a legend ...
It can’t be real 😢
YNWA Jürgen ! Danke Schoen!!!!!
😢😢😢😢
We Are Liverpool . . . !!!
I’m Spurs fan but this is really shocking. His statistics make every single game more fun to watch and his character is beloved by every football fan I suppose. All fans and players seemed to trust him as a person and a manager.  I suppose it was a great journey for him, which won so many titles. Thank you Klopp, Thank you Liverpool. You’ll be missed.😢
Oh no 😢
jürgen Klopp ..decent and great coach ever ..
So, will Ten Hag replace Klopp if things don't go well for him Man U?😅
I’m crying…. 😢😢
Brilliant tactic to win the league, players will have rockets up their arses haha
You'll Never Walk Alone, Jürgen Klopp.❤
Truly an end of an era still cannot digest the fact that he’s leaving truly the best manager in my eyes ynwa jurgen ❤
💔
We are Liverpool. I'll miss you very much Klopp. Very very very much.
😢😢😢
Win us the double and ride off into the sunset. I love you klopp. You brought liverpool back
Build this man a statue, today ❤
Damnnnnn 😢😢😢
I'm in absolute shock! He's irreplaceable. YNWA Jürgen. 😢
Probably because he can't stand living in Liverpool any longer 😢
I'm gutted but feel very lucky we had him. Liverpool Legend
❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😢
We love you klopp & God loves you. ❤
He will never just be a normal guy. Not to any liverpool fan anyway. Absolute embodiment of our club.
No way kloop is a legend
I'm a Lazio supporter but Klopp made me like Liverpool. He will be missed in prem. and Trust me Pep hearing this news  will be beginning  of end for him at City. Pep needs Klopp or City would practically  have no challenge and Pep would become bored!
What a bloke !!! Can never thank you enough sir .
hats off for what you have done to the red, you have totally transformed the club. I hope Alonso would be our next boss.
Thank you Jürgen for everything YNWA
He won more In a short period of time than Arsen wenger won in his 20 odd years
wow i was so looking forward to this year and and here year starting to get bad
No way💔
This is bullshit
😭😭😭😭😭
Legend. Thank you.
😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ynwa klopp will all ways be in are hearts thank you for everythink you done for the club
The FA and OFFICIALS will be made up mission accomplished 💩💩💩💩💩💩
I was almost in tears. He has my acceptance of him leaving he's getting older and the energy levels are going lower and he feels it. Let him go on a high let go out there and win all the trophy's we can this season
nooooo 😢😢😢
Heartbreak is Klopp
Nooooooooooooooo
Gutted. But I understand and respect his decision. It's still a shocker though. 😞
Thanks Boss
WELCOME TO BARCELONA KLOPP🥳
Heartbreaking news 😢. He looks tired and because of the passion he has for the game,it takes more out of him than most. He's an extremely emotional guy,wears his heart on his sleeve,and that can be exhausting for a guy like klopp. To say I'll miss him is an understatement,he is pure class on and off the pitch. The other thing that we must all respect is that he hasn't left when we were struggling last year,he has made sure we are back at the top before he leaves. Legend is way over used these days,but Klopp is a remarkable human being,and will always be a legend to us Liverpool fans. We love you klopp!..all i can say is that i hope you and your family have a wonderful life in the future!..YNWA ❤ You don't have to explain to us Klopp,we understand 100%❤ If only the world was full of people like klopp,what a wonderful world it would be!.
😊❤
He wants to live a normal life just that
Absolutely gutted but totally understand why he's doing this. Thank you for everything and lets make sure Jurgen goes out with a bang! ❤❤❤
Devoed. Knew it was coming but thought maybe next year or the year after. What a man. YNWA Boss.
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo😢
Good luck klopp, what manager what a human being  coming from an Arsenal fan
Not a Liverpool fan, my loyalties are for another club in red, NFFC, but I`ve always admired the energy and style he brought to the PL. Up there with the best, along with Shanks and Cloughie. All the best for him on his football journey.
Thank you for everything you did for us. You’ll be always in our hearts ❤❤❤
Spurs fan here. The emotion I felt watching this took me by surprise. Good luck and thanks for the love for the game.
Gool luck klopp,from a city fan 💙
😢
So shocked, so sad, so worried for the future but above all so grateful for what "Uncle Jurgen" did for the club and the incredible joys he brought us fans. Thanks you for your service and good luck for you life.  Definitely You'll Never Walk Alone
This man made me absolutely fall in love my club again and really be emotionally invested in everything we do! Thank you Klopp! You brought the best back to this club! You turned doubters to believers! You’ll never walk alone. 🙌🏾❤️
Sad to see him go, and I respect that he needs passion to do the job, it would be worse to see a Klopp without passion. The season is not done, we are Liverpool! Let's go!
This person needs a commemorative things, like statue, name of a stand or something, he creating a great era in 8-9 years in LFC, high or low still love this guy, YNWA Jürgen
Jurgen I thought I was dreaming...
Thank you for making us Dream❤️❤️❤️❤️ You'll Never Walk Alone Jurgen ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ You leaving breaks my heart but I completely understand it. You'll be massively Missed I just can't picture the Club without you. You were made for Liverpool and Liverpool was made for you 💔💔💔🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭❤❤❤
...is it too early to start drinking?
Thank you so much for everything Jurgen. Your health is the most important thing. You have meant so much to all Liverpool fans. thank you so much
I just hope that his influence and the way the club is run will continue to some degree. Maybe he could return in some other capacity after taking a much deserved break?
As a life long Man Utd fan you may find it hard for Liverpool fans to hear me give praise. However, I fully respect and like Jurgen Klopp for all he has done for the club and the supporters of Liverpool FC. Also he has taken on board the complexities surrounding the history and cultures of a great city. I for one will miss him when he is gone. Good luck Klopp.
Bring in Mick McCarthy for next season. 🏆💯👍☘️
Why he do this?😢😢😢😢
A sad day!
Will Pep Lijnders atleast stay ?
Feels like I'm back in the Shankly announcement,  Jesus's this hurts as bad. YNWA 🤝🇮🇪 love and respect Kloppo.
I got a big feeling thats he will BE the new Manager of Barca :(
Can’t handle city
You don't have too 🤧
😢😢❤💔
Can’t stop crying since this news broke out today. It hurts so bad We love you Kloppo so much💔💔💔
Sad sad day! What a Human being! The power of influence he has over everyone he crossed paths with is INCREDIBLE! Get GARETH SOUTHGATE OUT & BRING IN KLOPP!!!! If there is a man that could bring victory back to England he 100 percent is that person!!!!
I am a united supporter and this makes me sad because the energy he brings to the league and his club is what we need, I really wished that united could have a similar relationship between the players and the manager. Wish you all the best Klopp🙌🏻👏
The man who made the Prem fun. To bad the prem let teams cheat 100% why he quit
I wish you never left. I want to be together forever. I hope you don't abandon us. I respect your choice, but my heart is sad right now. I will remember you forever. Thank you, boss.  But I hope the current decision is reversed.
I’ll never forget what this man has done for this club. A true hero that has never shied away from any challenge thrown at him. The success you have achieved has been fantastic, but the passion, love and belief you have instilled back into the team, the club and the supporters, is the greatest achievement. Let’s finish this chapter the true Liverpool way. YNWA
what a great and honest interview!
what a fantastic man ..........  honest open and great at his job ..... appreciate and celebrate what he has achieved for you kopites ...you were fortunate to have him as manager
It's Like a marriage Sometimes , you better Leave after 9 years , then live together Like Brother and sister 😏
Klopp is a legend 💯 I’m in absolute shock but I wish him all the best 💙💪🏻 Forever a red 🫶🏻
Is he going to Saudi Arabia?
Absolute legend. Turned us from doubters to believers! What a man! Good luck for the future! YNWA
I'm a BVB fan. He did great at all clubs. I wish him all the best for the future.
Im finished
Thank you, our boss.Let's definitely win the championship！
😂😂
Legend ❤❤❤
We love him but we have to let him go. Live your life Jurgen. You’ve more than earned it. You’ll always be a Red no matter where you go. Let’s make the rest of the season one we’ll never forget. YNWA ❤️
Oh wow!!! This is sad😢!!!! Legend, history was made... But will fill these shoes, xabi Alonso??????
💔💔😞😞
Klopp embodied everything Liverpool Football Club stood for. There will never be anyone like him ever again. 😢 😭
We have to win the title for him!!!
Thank you for everything you did for the club...... definitely a heartbreak moment 💔....YNWA
🥲🥲
영원한 나의 감독님❤
As LFC fan over 25 years i watched us becoming champions of europe, EPL winners europa league winners everything and every trophy and seen a lot of sadness a lot of happiness  moments but never felt as much as broken for this leaving decision i knew it gonna happen but i tho after my death   Jürgen Norbert Klopp dear leader words are not enough and thanks cannot fill all the efforts and sacrifices you've made for us liverpool all  i can say to you right now YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE     The real question is we the fans of liverpool must think who can fit his position as he was thinking how the next season will be we must be all klopps
United fan here but huge respect to you sir. Loved u at dortmund and watching u in the prem has been a dream come true. Best of luck
Last night i cried after seeing my country Malaysia fought like hell and  managed to scored at the dying minutes to level with team Korea......now I'm crying again hearing this......from Malaysia to Liverpool with love ❤❤ Klopp the Best
MY HEART HURTS
I knew this day was coming but I can’t accept it still 😭😭😭😭😭
He is right  this about your life  thanks Good job
I am a chelsea fan, this is a great great interview
Oh Captain, my captain.  YNWA Jürgen!
Love this man YNWA ❤
Leeds fan here, but i will miss seeing and listening to Klopp. the guys got passion, integrity and a great character
well done Jurgen, your going out on your terms. thanks for the magic monents and enjoy having a more stressless life. you deserve it. YNWA
Thank you, Jurgen. ❤
I am a chelsea fan, this is a great great interview
Liverpool will not be the same again
Jurgen should go to Real and Pep to Barca, and carry on from there. 😂
Gonna miss them Pep versus Klopp games ..them games were on another level
KLOP YOU CAME YOU SAW YOU CONQUERED ‼️‼️‼️….you won our HEARTS AND FULL RESPECT ……..YOU ARE  AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE GOAT 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐IN MY VIEW ….THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES  AND ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR THIS GREAT CLUB AND FOOTBALL IN THIS COUNTRY …….YWNA ‼️
Boom... ggs Klopp.
And as long as Gerrard aint coach on the back of king Klopp
thank you for everythings kloop ❤❤❤❤ Y.N.W.A we will miss you
I’m not a Liverpool fan, but Klopp was the best thing to happen to them in recent times. It will be sad to see him go but hopefully he’ll enjoy his next step.
we will love you klopp forever no1 manager of the world
Yes,we didn’t see that coming! One of the best managers we have ever had. For me, never mind the football,  think of him as a foreigner being embraced by Liverpool, the city, and expressing  this interview in ENGLISH ! A top manager has to communicate to players, staff,owners and most importantly … fans. Klopp does this with a deep felt belief in what he wants to achieve.
"We are Liverpool" ❤
As a neutral football fan, thank you Jürgen, for so many entertaining moments in English football. The PL will not be the same without you, your humour and your commitment.  All the very best ❤
Big babys
He's done incredibly great job.. he has made fantastic achievement for Liverpool and for himself.. Premier league title after 30 years of drought and a Champions league trophy.. it's a sad sad moment for  Liverpool's supporters all over the world.. but we can understand his reasons.. we always love you Klopp.! Warmest regards from Indonesia.. You'll never walk alone
Please tell me Xabi Alonso is coming in 😭
He will manage Germany.. maybe in a year or so once he feels recharged .. he even said it.. i wont manage a club or country.. Country management gives him a better life balance
His statue has to be him fist pumping the sky.
We Love you Klopp, I really understand you… isn’t a lack of love/respect/empathy/etc…. It’s about being honest with yourself and your loved club.  Thank you Klopp❤❤❤❤
He is the perfect manager for us, as if he was born for LFC. His coming and his departure are so huge for our club, that I’m afraid our next manager, whoever is going to be, will have a very hard time to replicate. Let’s give this kind man all our love and admiration and let’s hope our next manager will have such a strong character and charisma that he will make Klopp a sweet memory and a good friend that has departed, and not someone that we will be bitterly missing in football. Dear Jurgen, YNWA !! ❤❤❤❤ 😢😢😢😢
What an absolute Legend, as a Manager and as a person, Thank you for restoring us to where we rightfully belong, thnak you for the memories!! YNWA our Boss Jurgen!!!
Take a year out and come back . Pep will look after us and keep the seat warm  😢 you were made for us and we are made for you  YNWA
Sitting here wondering who will take after Klopp, His shoes are too big to be filled.😮‍💨 You are the best thing that happened to us Jurgen Klopp! I'm sure this decision wasn't easy but its what best for you and the club and we respect that Gaffer! We will miss you on the touchline but you will always be Liverpool anywhere you go❤ Thank you for everything and all the best my Hero!😣
Thank you Jurgen! I hope you are happy and have a great time in whatever you do. YNWA
I understand and I respekt your decision. But this feels like losing ones father. 😭😭😭 Love you Jürgen! ❤️
Which means he will manage Germany for 2025 for 2026 World Cup.  German football needs a revival that he can deliver.
Oh No, here we go on the roundabout of managers
This man is a pillar of Liverpool and the perfect description how a man's character can perfectly fit with a clubs image. All the best for his rest year. Can't imagine after 8 years to see him as a team manager of another club.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Heartbreaking
This was a genuine shocker to me, I can't even put into words how shocked I am about the sudden news.  Jürgen Klopp has been such a valued member in Liverpool FC, he turned a club struggling for success into one of the biggest clubs the football community has ever seen. Klopp will always reamin in my heart as one of the favourite managers in football history. When he take his leave at the end of the season, he will be missed by all of us. YNWA Klopp ❤❤❤
If it's the right decision for Jürgen it's the right decision for Liverpool. You can see in his face in this video how tired he looks, this man gives his heart and soul and it must take a lot out of him. It's just like Klopp to be different and anounce his departure when the team are top of the league, almost every single manager gets sacked, at least this way Liverpool can be prepared for next season. Whoever comes in next has a hard act to follow but also a good starting point. Good luck in every thing you do Jürgen, you will never be forgotten at Liverpool, thank you for everything you did for the club. YNWA.
xabi in, klopp to germany
I’m so scared of what the future holds with Klopp gone, I don’t want us to end up like United 💔
You'll never walk alone gaffer. Thank you for everything that you've done for our club and we wish you all the best for your future endeavours.  Let's finish strong.
Wow just wow. A true gentleman. A man's man. A player's coach. May the Kop forever sing of Klopp 🙌🏿
This news is worse than two years of covid 😢😢😢
Come boys, let's win a quadruple to send off Klopp in a big way.
The fact that so many supporters of other clubs  posting their tributes to this man says a lot! Liverpool and the league won't be the same without him.
This man deserves all the respect, and we respect your decision Jurgen. YNWA
Devastated! 😢
Its the bloody owners not backing him
Why not take a year off and let pep   have a year as coach and then make your mind up. I'm absolutely gutted with this news.
Still can't believe what im watching, as much as klopp says everything else is going to be ok, he's wrong, love the guy, knew this day would come but I just hope the season doesn't fall apart which more than likely will happen, who's next
Wow Liverpool 2.0  XALONSO???
9 years is a long time to have the weight of a club like Liverpool on your shoulders. Jurgen is self aware enough to know when it is becoming  too much and he can't give as much as he wants.
Devastated. What a brave decision and delivered now to give Liverpool enough time to plan and make decisions. Only one man can take up the challenge.....Xabi!!!!
The last 9 years were the best period for me as a lifelong Liverpool fan. Sometimes, we take it for granted, for we are used to it. We certainly are used to having Klopp as the icon of Liverpool. Without him at the helm, I find it difficult to imagine how Liverpool would be. Let's treasure and enjoy the remaining 30-plus games under Klopp.
I’m not even a Liverpool fan , infact a united fan but I m devastated 😢
Klopp,  Liverpool is not my team, but what you have done to that club is legendary. I will miss seeing you when we play, but it is understandable why we do what we do when we have been somewhere for some time. Gold bless your family and you.   Love you always,  Fan  Ps. You won it all, my friend. You did what most have dream off and what few have achieved. You are a gift from God. Thank you.
What a man, manager and human being.
Sad but true 😢😢😢
Whyyyy kloppppp
Liverpool is klopp 🫡
So sad rn
José Mourinho next
To say good bye after a very long and successful time, and in a moment the team performance pretty well, should alway feel right.
KONTOL SEDIH COKK😭😭
YNWA we love you Klopp thankyou for turning this team into something special again. I only wish you the best in your future endeavours <3
We will all miss you honestly. As a Man Utd fan I don't want good things to happen to Liverpool but this gaffer deserves a lot of credit for the kind of person he's been in all the years. He's got a Respectable Personality. We all wish him the best.
It's absolutely incredible the amount of respect you can develop for a man you've never met. Thank you for the memories, Jurgen. We hope the passion for football will find you again.
I can‘t take this😭how can I watch Liverpool without Kloop
So that's it for Klopp, the staff a few players as well. Let's end this era with a league win
I am Liverpool forever...ever since Craig Johnstone, Ian Rush Days...We are Liverpool! YNWA! Means Everything to me in so many ways...this club has & is my heart & soul! If ever there was one person who embodies Liverpool football Club & what it stands for & what it means to love Liverpool FC!!!...It is Jurgen Klopp! What a man! What a manager! What honesty & truth & speaking from the heart! My respect & admiration for this man has just risen on so many levels...What love & passion he has for Liverpool FC & it`s future to say what he just said! You will be missed Gaffa & you will always be loved! As we are Liverpool & you dear beautiful man...WILL NEVER WALK ALONE! YNWA
17:16 “I wound never managed another club in England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 💯 than Liverpool, that’s not possible ” 😢  my love for this club, my respect for these people is so big that I couldn’t for a second think about it”   Legend
Man United supporter here, obviously.. what a legend Klopp is! You will be missing him, but the team he put together will continue to be a powerhouse. P.S. You can not hate this guy, no matter what
Rumour has it that after United got Omar from City, they concluded a deal with Klopp on coming to United after the season ends... 😂
U fucker I loved the club cause of u and made me fall in love with everything and I just can't type anymore😢
Damn i just realized that oir next championsleague is without klopp😢
What??? No!!!!!???😢
Jürgen is a red 🔴
I'm in tears so sad
Thank you for everything! Let’s go get those trophies 🏆 ❤️
Liverpool FC should change "THE KOP"  to the "THE KLOPP"
What a man ❤️
어디가요ㅠㅠㅠㅠ제발가지마요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ아 진짜 마음아파
All the best to you Boss.This is beautiful long road.❤
Thanks jurgen
I can’t accept that 😭
제발 거짓말이라고 해줘
I hope this push our boys to get the quadruple for our manager🥺🥺
Sad day as a Liverpool fan
just 100% authentic. Always.
"It's not important what people think when you come in but what they think when you leave"
Klopps a legend and has a great personality it's great to see him leaving on his own terms ❤
NEW ENGLAND MANAGER ...ONCE HE'S HAD A BREAK .. PLEASE TAKE OVER AND GET SOUTHGATE OUT 👏👏👏👏👏
I got a call by my dad saying he was leaving, and I all most cried. He has been the best and transferred liverpool thank you so much
If he is planning on leaving i really hope that LFC should bring Xabi Alonso as his replacement....  Also Jurgen Klopp shall truely be missed..he gave Liverpool the premier league title chances and the fans excitement and enthusiasm with what he created here at the club❤
I don't know how to feel about this, but Thank you Jürgen. We love you. Always
Thank you for everything. You were amazing, and it was one hell of a trip to take with you. YNWA
Thank you, boss! YNWA
Oh no , we need Alonso back

❤😢
Klopp needed a rest he deserved  And he will come back in 3 years to manage the club for the 2nd time
Mid table club again hahaha
At first I was upset, but after listening,  this makes absolutely sense... All the best Sir.. YNWA.
Gonna miss you, one the best liverpool manager of all time. Love from singapore ❤

He gave liverpool the Tommy T treatment
I'm happy for Jurgen.  Gets to step away healthy and on his terms.  Forever a legend.

Klopp is irreplaceable 😢 Liverpool will become like Man U after Alex Ferguson left the club
Danke Kloppo
I’m crying ㅠㅡㅠ
The whole management team is leaving too. There must be something more to why he is leaving
Thank you sir for the memories. Thank you for the glory years. We love you and respect you so much. Good luck for the future You’ll Never Walk Alone

We love you Klopp! Thank you for everything, although we part ways, you will be forevered remember as a legend in Liverpool. Build him a statue. He 100% deserves it!!   YNWA ❤
Damn from an arsenal fan . Great manager , got the prem title they always craved forget everything else. Good luck mr klopp
He will manage Germany at some point.
In simple terms he knows that his body can’t keep up with the pace of the league and pacing up and the sidelines, he’s getting older and he explained that he has less energy then before that tells you all. Now it’s time for a younger manger to pick up the remains after the season-Coming from. Arsenal fan ❤
I've heard about this guy. I believe he is good and will have a great future in football.
Thank you Jürgen!!   An incredible 8 years. You’ve taken our club so far! You’ve worked with fewer resources than others and yet won everything with the club. It’s been a pleasure watching the team you’ve managed. Best of luck in your next chapter!  Thank you Pepijn and Peter! You don’t always get the praise you deserve! It takes a great team to achieve the heights lfc have in recent years. Best of luck to the both of you in your next chapters!
Why does this man make me cry?! I’m 45 years old with 3 kids!!!
Take the german nationalteam
Thank you ❤
Arsenal supporter here, Klopp brought something different to the league, his energy, love and enthusiasm for the game are unmatched as a manager, a class act he will be missed by everyone..Much love Liverpool 🙏🏾❤
worse than broke up😢
From doubters to believers ♥️ Thank you Jurgen💔
I’m in tears, Thank you for giving me the best footballing memories of my life. There were a lot of really difficult times before you but you’ve brought us to places I could of only dreamed about. Thank you Jurgen.
managers age worst than politicians haha
2024 hasnt been the greatest year so far..
Jürgen klopp and Pep Guardiola change the level of premier League.They will be remembered forever in football history.
Liverpool ohne Klopp ist wie Fußball ohne Ball. 🥺
😭😭😭
Much love and respect to that man ✊
Thank you Jurgen❤ Liverpool legend🏆🥰. YNWA
Thank you for making me a Liverpool fan Jürgen, gave us so many memories which we can come back to with so much happiness and joy  You'll forever stay in our hearts, Once a red, always a red You'll never walk alone, Jürgen
Hope liverpool win the league this season , his legacy deserves more than one pl trophy

I feel like crying FFS 😢YNWA ❤
Not all heroes wear capes
You deserve a Statue at Anfield !!!!! You brought back the pride and confidence of the club. As Liverpool fc and football lover i am greatful to Juergen Klopp......
At the end of the day....respect. You've had enough, totally understand. Enjoy the rest, derserved. One of the manager legends
Please don't go KLOPP 🙏
The PL will be emptier after he leaves. His dedication, professionalism and pure genius will be missed. Good luck in the future, Jurgen. 🚩🚩🚩
Its Jose Time !
My Manager, thank you. YNWA Jurgen ❤️
Worst Friday Ever😢
Step forward Joey Barton.
shocking... i still can't believe it that Klopp will leave LFC. We will miss you, Klopp, The Legend.
Please don't
Ynwa.
Why klopp
THANKS. YNWA❤
I know Jürgen Klopp a long time, Mainz, BVB, Liverpool. We all love a great winner, but even better than that is GREAT loser. That is Klopp. He never made excuses after losing. He spoke highly of the club he lost against. And being the wise man he is, he very well knew, you learn much more after a loss, then after winning a game. I have never seen a manager that has loved his players more the Klopp. This is what our world needs. "All we need is LOVE". Klopp may God continue to use you as he already has in such an incredible way. Love you. You never have to walk alone.
This is stupid. I am tremendously affected and depressed. I can’t believe this came in so sudden. I believed there are some things happening on the management level. The disagreement are ongoing. It must have been with Liverpool budget issues. Probably no support for Mbappe purchase. The contract has a couple more years left but there is no reason for this sudden exit.   I am very very very affected. God help me please.
We'll have Klopp back anytime. King Klopp💯
Do not want him to go but it's better that he goes on a high than the supporters trying to get him out because of one poor season. Like some other managers Legends retire like Jurgen like Sir Alex they are not sacked.
😢😢❤
Why Jurgen why???
ม่ายยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยยย 😭😭😭
im crying at this moment after hearing you are going Jürgen , Love and respect to you and the years you gave to us .
Safe new Teamcoach the national team from germany. Nagelmann out!
No empire lasts forever, we have to build again YNWA#
cerikk iyema cokk cerikkk nyeri hate kieee,tega pisannn kloppp😭😭😭😭
I’m angry. But I suppose that’s one stage of grief. Danke, Jurgen - you transformed our club. What a man. YNWA.   Why can’t he be given a year or two off and get another manager in for two years. Then get him back when he’s ready?
Cherish every game from now til the seasons end, Jürgen is a once in a lifetime manager! 🥹❤
😢😢M.united and others laughing at us now 😢😢😢😢😢
YNWA❤
Maybe pep will leave soon too
thank you Jürgen, YNWA❤
Legend
No manager in the world of football has the respect that Klopp has from the Liverpool fans and vice versa. Everything comes to an end. This will be the end of the Klopp era and it is his choice and we have to respect that. We, at first may not be happy with the decision but it is his right and because of the respect he has for the club and team, he has gone about it in the right manner.   The time left of this current season gives the club time to prepare and get right the decisions for the future of the club. As a fan, I’m sad but I understand his reasons. Other clubs will try and use this decision against us but we have to stand fast. For those of you who would want to castigate Klopp for his decision … you are not a true fan, period.   The team, club and Klopp needs all our support and I for one will continue my loyalty that I have shown the club for 60 years. Klopp and his teams have giving us some very memorable times and we are truly thankful for that.   Jurgen and Ulla YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE!
What in the world???
Welcome Xabi Alonso
❤YNWA Jurgen❤
Panutanqu.. well said!!
No matter how much I Hate this shitty club Liverpool, one thing is for sure you can’t Hate Jurgen.. What a gentleman
Is he leaving football?If No why this bullshit.
Thank you Jurgen YNWA
We love you Jurgen. Never forget that. Thank you for everything you are doing and have done. You will never walk alone!
Oh.. noooo..😢
Nothing but love for klopp. The players should win the league for his send forth
I can't take this heartache anymore 😕😔😔
I've never met Jurgen but my goodness what a beautiful, genuine soul. Watching that interview I couldn't stop the tears. What a human being. What a manager. What a BOSS! I have even more respect for him now than ever before and I didn't think that was ever possible. To say I am totally gutted at this news is such an understatement but for the love of his club, his players and us the fans, he has done what he believes is right for all of us and most importantly for himself. Once you go Jurgen enjoy every second with your family and your grandchild, times moves so very quickly. You deserve the very best in life and I only hope that us the fans, and our players give absolutely everything for the rest of the season and make it the best one yet. We love you Mr Klopp. YNWA X
YNWA
The King is Dead,,,,,,,,,,,Long live the King
Get on the phone to Xavi immediately!!
RIP Jürgen Klopp 1967-2024
No please dont. My heart ache as if I just broke up with my fiance. This news makes a grown man cries
Now I m alone without you jurgen😢
I have no words at all for how absolutely sincere and human Jurgen is. A wonderful man. YNWA ❤
Thank you for rendering my life happy. will miss a lot. ❤
Win the title to end this era with an happy ending😢
End of era , god luck mister, u live in my heart
You are loved, Jurgen. You are a wonderful man and a Liverpool legend.
Jesus Christ... I always feared of that day to come but i thought that he will stay for at keast two more years.  This man transormed the club from absolute shambles to the most dangerous football club in the world like it was back inthe glory years of 80's.  Without the shadow of a doubt he is on the pair with Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Juergen Klopp is a Liverpool legend and there is no denial to that.  There will be massive hole left in our hearts and lots of lads will shed a tear when the dooomsday happens. That hole will not be easily replaced.  Juergen set up the bar for the next manager incredibly high. Right now the only man i see fit to inherit Juergens legacy is Pepijn Lijnders and nobody else even comes close.   That is if Juergen will want to retire. If not he will go back to Yellow Wall or Mainz for a season or two i very much doubt he is done just yet.  As certain man said to retire from Anfield while you are at your best takes great courage but to retire from football is impossible.  YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE JUERGEN!!! Once a Red always a Red!!!
well done Jurgen! the pressure at the top is immense, you deserve a break, look after yourself and good luck for whatever you do in the future, you deserve it we will always be grateful for what you gave us!
Not a Liverpool supporter, but still sad hearing this news as Kloop being at Liverpool was guarantee that we will get to see entertaining football. Especially thank you for the Liverpool vs City games.
United fan here.. I have utmost respect for Klopp, he will be missed by all
Danke schön, Herr Klopp ❤
Thank you Klopp, let's win 4 champions this season! YNWA <3
Best since Paisley, legend of the club will always be loved and respected ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm a Man Utd fan, but i respect Klopp completely. He suited Liverpool perfectly, and tore us a new one, several times😢
Greatest respect for this man, his work and as well his decision!
Someone please tell me this is a prank 😢😢😢
NO NO NO😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😢
Why was he saying all the right words. Gosh this is heartbreaking but I understand and respect your decision, boss. Thank you for everything.
Am in shock I can't believe klopp will us 😢😢😢
This is as big as sir Alex leaving Man Utd - I can’t hold back my tears
Without fire there’s no smoke.. Obviously something happened
dimanapun kloop melatih saya akan tetap dukung dan jadi fans berat kloop❤ 😭😭😭😭😭
Now! Pls let this guy work in peace until the end of the season 🚀 let's focus on the game!
We will miss you "The Normal One".
😢😢😢
Мне так херово на душе сейчас 😭😭😭😭😭
A legend, cheated out of titles by the cheating arabs too.
Im an United fan Bigtym but this broke my heart,Klopp n Liver was a match made in the stars.....wat a careeer ,wat a manager .....wish u all the best in ur normal life that yu wish ....Only man to make Pep sweat 😄😄😄 Respect KLOPP
Thank you boss
Rename the Kop to the Klopp, because it’s the heart and soul of Anfield just as he has been. Don’t be sad that it’s over be glad that we got to experience it. YNWA ❤️
Good luck for the future jurgen and thank you for everything you have done for us at liverpool  you never walk alone.
I feel like crying
Will  jose be the one to take the job for Liverpool after klopp PS. YNWA
I believe he will go to Bayern or the German National team. It will be very hard to find a manager to replace Klopp, definitely not Tuchel or Mourinho. Liverpool will then be like Man U after Sir Alex.
Feel sorry for Norwich, Anfield is going to be going absolutely crazy.
Klopp is just a legend in this club. One of the best managers in the world   YNWA ❤
Tough man to follow…I would be lying if I said I wasn’t worried.
Gutted.
Klopp is our special one, forever and forever.
😭😭😭
Welcome to Arsenal Klopp 🎉🎉🎉
YNWA ❤ we will forever remember the memories you’ve given us. You’ve written new pages in the history books and we could not be more grateful. Thank you Jurgen, and let’s make this last push for the Premier League!🎉❤
Neville will surely ask Carragher how he feels about this 😂
Takes a year out then gets the Germany job
Well, honestly, I don't know how to process this. This man has been the reason for many happy moments, transforming this team and establishing my love for the game. I'm shattered by it, but I'm so grateful for the memories he's given us all. YNWA reds, savour every last minute we can of this and the beautiful football he has us playing.
This hits harder than a break up 💔
Heartbroken but the respect I have for this man makes me just wanna give him a hug. His speech was class. Knows exactly what the fans want to hear and going out at the top of his game.   Now does anyone have xabi alonsos phone number handy?
The shock in the system is reverberating everywhere, totally speechless but hope this steers LIverpool to a quadruple as the perfect send off!
Time stamps that soften the blow for Liverpool fans  16:52 17:42 18:32 19:40 20:35 24:19  Will miss you Jurgen, let’s go give it out all this season!
Juergen Klopp is a Liverpool legend for ever.
What a Legend! Respect!
As chelsea fans, I love u Mr klopp. And will be always remember your smile
Corrupt officials Corrupt gaming body  Why push yourself swimming upstream? I'm 100% certain he would stay if the game wasn't so plagued by 'unfairness'
😭😭😭😭😭😓
premiere league has lost one of the best manager with passion.
Thank you for your service.       Will be remembered as a legend.❤
did he perchance take some inadvertant gene therapy that might cause him to have no more energy?
This man is responsible for turning this great club into winners again!!   We will miss you! Thanks for the memories ❤  Jurgen Norbert Klopp YNWA ❤
From doubters to believers 😢 You'll be kissed Klopp YNWA
บอสว่าไง ผมตามนั้น แค่บอสสั่ง พร้อมส่งเสียง
Without fire there’s no smoke.. Obviously something happened
You'll never walk alone Klopp❤
i can’t even watch a full minute without pausing and sobbing
😭😭😭😭
This is absolutely brilliant to make the decision right now,players will gave not 100% but 200% every game just for him
🥲
This is like shanks leaving, but look who carried on and what happened, we got Bob. Remember no one person is greater than the club, we will go onwards! Ynwa
His body language says more than his words. Very, very difficult interview for him.
The final game Liverpool will turn red
I would give up winning all trophies this year as long as Klopp stays, but he must do what he feels is right for him and his family. Thank you Jurgen for everything you have done for Liverpool FC.
No No No  😓😓😓
Klopp deserves to make this decision and I hope we all are able to respect this fact. YNWA Klopp!
Jurgen klopp will always there in my heart
Strange time to be leaving after engaging in a rebuild. I think there's more to this that he's not telling us.
Thank you Klopp for all you've done for this club, as a younger Liverpool fan I wasn't able to see much success from us until you came and I just want to thank you for lifting the club back to where it belongs at the top of English football. YNWA
I’m so glad that Juergen is a red I’m so glad he delivered what he said😢
The Greatest Coach Liverpool has ever seen. YNWA Klopp ❤
hopefully LFC best farewell gift to Papa Klopp by winning Quandrable this season
Oh noo😢😢😢
Klopp has his way with his word 😢 😭😭😭😭
i hope salah will still score with different playstyle
When it comes to people I’ve never met, Jurgen is the one I love the most. Thank you for everything boss.
You are so awesome
Legend ❤
The man deserves a Statue. YNWA Jurgen. Thank you.
😭😭😭😭
👌👌👌YNWA🙏
❤😂
I beg the whoever's in charge, let Pep take the wheel, don't hire anyone else please.
he will live forever as part of this clubs DNA. YNWA. Nice one Boss. x
its fsg's push for the docu series. he said he wouldn't be a manager like that. They have over ridden him hence why he said hes not in the driving seat anymore. Our club is private. we shouldnt sell out like the others., im devastated and the man looks defeated. Klopp is lfc. always.. ynwa
The man don't getthe credit he should, he will go on and do even bigger thing's , he is Liverpool through and through, he doesn't get the money needed 2 get big players in, done it all with a budget. It will be hard 2 fill bis boots, good luck for the future wherever it takes you LEGENDS NEVER DIE. Respect 2 you for letting us know whats happening . Good luck ❤❤❤❤ YNWA LFC 🙏🏻🍻👊🏻
Build. The. Statue.
Bro, this is so from the heart. Friday Jan 26th, 2024. A historic moment.
He deserves a statue
I feel sick
I hope he wins everything there is to win this season for a perfect final season 🔥❤⚽️
🫡🫡🫡🫡
As a fan I'm gutted, we have enjoyed having one of the best managers to ever grace the Premier League, what a guy, a true Legend. I wish you would stay longer but I understand your decision and wish you all the best in the future. We love you Jurgen Klopp. YNWA
I honestly don't think anyone expected the master class this man, this LEGEND created. Challenging City year in and year out. He brought life back into the club, I fell in love with watching Liverpool again, more than I'd ever expected. Missing him would be an understatement, and words wouldn't do justice to how much he meant to everyone in football. It's not goodbye. See you later Klopp YNWA ❤
Devastated. But Liverpool goes on. I hope it doesn’t affect the season but we are the most successful club in England and will continue being so 💪✌️⚽️
How can you hate this man???
KLOPP! 😢❤ Always be one of us
YNWA God’s blessed the Man ❤
What a man. Vulnerable and open. Coming out to the world with the news that you need a break cannot be easy, with most people surely assuming you live the life of a king and must be crazy to give something like that up. For the beautiful narrative, even as an Arsenal supporter, I'm kind of co-rooting for LFC now for the remainder of the season. I've always liked and admired Klopp, and ever since his time at Dortmund have been rooting for him. Best of luck, and my sincerest wishes to him and his family for a comfortable and calm life.
Thanks Jürgen for a great Time in Liverpool. You will never be forgotten YNWA ❤❤❤
Please don’t :(
💔
This is my first time as a Liverpool fan seeing a manager leave and its someone like Klopp, Im heartbroken and out of words to describe how I'm feeling now.
Win the lot for this man 🙏🏾
If he leaves its over for us i cant someone else coaching liverpool
There was a time he intimated this that people don’t understand how difficult to be in this job. You go for champions league stay in hotels 🏨 you don’t have normal life and time to be with your family. He said it himself that he would want to spend time with family when he is till healthy. Mr Klopp you and an absolute legend. As a die hearted Liverpool fan from Sierra Leone 🇸🇱 West Africa. I want to appreciate you with all my heart ❤️.
No Matter What , We Liverpool Fans will always have love for Legend that is Jürgen Klopp. Forever
As an arsenal fan, klop has been the manager i always respected ever since he came in..   The man is a true legend, turned the team from Loserpool to the most feared team.  You will be missed. You deserve a statue
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Jurgen please don't😢😢😢😢😢😢
I am literally shaking it's like a hot knife just passed through my heart 😭😭😭😭
Peps news coming soon
Jurgen…. 😭 thank you
A sad day.. but must respect his decision.. u make us from doubters to believers.. thank u klopp.. will miss u.. haters will be haters.. u will be remember for a long time.. thank u
Oh my god what a shock news!!! 😢😢😢😮😮😮 I'm from Malaysia will always remember him, he change the Liverpool into the dream team and masterpiece. Come on Liverpool players win Carabao, FA Cup, Premier League and Europa League Cup for Jurgen Kloop!!!!!!!
O no!
Gutted but what a manager!  YNWA
Absolutely heartbroken.  He is a father figure and the reason I love this club so much.  He deserves a statue and the final day against Wolves will surely be so emotional... let's send him off the proper way by winning the lot.  Big shoes to fill for however is coming after.... he was the man which had such an emotional connection with the city and that's the reason why people loved him so much,,, Thanks for everything boss ❤❤
Im not ready for this
I will love you always, Klopp. Thank you so much for everything you've done.
In comes Xabi Alonso
Stay stay don't leave 🙌🙌🙌
Let's go win the league cup....for the GAFFER...
Come to barcelona please
I wake up to this devastating news with a heavy heart. I wish it was a dream but we love you Jurgen. You are Liverpool through and through. You leave with a Thank You ❤YNWA
Klopp deserves a statue right outside the front door he made Liverpool!
no way 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Now now, players, come on, give everything you got this season, let's win everything! Make Quadruple happen!!!!
We need a statue at liverpool ❤
"You want to leave with the crowd screaming for more. Not saying 'Your time's up'".  - Sir Matt Busby.
Probably I only felt as sad I today, when Gerrard left and then in Klopp first UCL final against Madrid. Time showed, that the team accomplished even more than just a final and got really talented players.  At the end there’s a golden sky. YNWA ❤
You'll always be my number one
give him a statue
Thank you for giving Liverpool the hope and reviving the club post the Kevin Keegan days
❤😢
WHYYY 😳😭😭 This is very hurting man 💔💔💔 😢😢😢
Love you Jürgen, YNWA❤
Klopp deserve statue he always will be part of Liverpool FC forever
😢
You’ll be missed. One of a kind! Couldn’t have asked for a better person to be our manager. After next summer, you’re welcome to come hang out with me at my HDB (public) apartment for an ordinary life experience.🥰🇸🇬😊
Worst day of my life
We knew this day was gonna come eventually, but I feel absolutely gutted and empty hearing this. I’ve never ever shed a tear on people moving on from the club, even players I adored in the past. That is not the case this time, absolutely gutted 😔
Good luck to him (after this season). The Guardiola/City vs Klopp/Liverpool battles were things of legend.
No words to say anything...Nummm.!!
I was already depressed before today, now this has just tipped me over the edge. I just can't.
Liverpool is Jürgen, and Jürgen is Liverpool.  We've accomplished a lot together, and we owe you the ultimate understanding.   Your name is permanently inscribed on our hearts.   What a man, what a Team, what a day! YNWA.
Joking right? Right ? 😢
Taking the Peleton money and..... Running
a word i have to said "Respect"
Total respect. YNWA
As a united fan i only can respect this man, and he will be miss as human being in the premier league 👏
I’m heart broken 💔
I hope he gets the say his farewells with another trophy in his hands. I hope he takes another job in a lower division to set their path for glory.
尊重克洛普的选择，ynwa
😔
Once a red, always a red. 😢
IM GUTTED. I FEEL SICK.
We love you my friend you have done a lot for us 🙏❤
Thank u klopp
The players and fans would run through walls for this man. YNWA Jürgen ♥️
Thanks for everything.. we will definitely miss you
This can't be real
God bless you. Let’s go for foursome in 2024 and send Klopp over the moon with four trophies
Im not crying your crying 😢
He lives ever kick of the ball and you can only do that for so long. We will miss Jürgen and I hope that the owners are working hard on the right man to come in. He transformed Liverpool FC and developed teams and players to deliver amazing games - who can forget Barcelona? As a fan, we will always appreciate what this man has given us. A great manager, a great man. YNWA
Amazing coach as well as an amazing human being! Love and respect from a Madridista, YNWA! ❤️🤍
This hurts in my stomach
Xabi Alonso ❤
i cant even imaging klopp will leave after this seasn thank you klopp for your memories you are the greatest manager i have ever seen you legend boss😔
Why today Klopp why todaya
최고의 감독님, 저는 감독님을 평생 잊지 못할 것 같습니다. 영원히 존경합니다.
Jurgen thanks for everything I love you more than words can explain
Легенда
Devastated to lose Klopp and happy that we had him for 9 years. Let’s win all the trophies to honor his exit!
Should of given him last year off , given pep the reigns once season was a right off.. he would of been rejuvenated . Wish you the best , no matter what you choose YNWA.. PAY HIM TO BE A BOARD ADVISER ..   he will have enough time to be a family man but we need this guy in some form.. give him a season ticket behind the dug out 😂
All these years it was a joy to watch  the team. Best of luck, boss
I remember the great Shanks and Paisley when they announced they’re stepping down and this feels the same. I’m devastated, but understand. Thank you Juergen Klopp, you’ve transformed the club and made us great again. Let’s send him out a winner. The club won’t be the same, but it goes on. It gives us plenty of time to find the right replacement, welcome Xabi Alonso your destiny awaits you.
Good person will always be missed
Homeboy "Captain Marvelous" will take over
We the fans salute you 👏 🙌  Obviously, nobody wants to lose one of the best managers the club has ever had. But I can't fault the effort, the attitude or the results that have been achieved since Jurgens arrival.  He's been INCREDIBLE. Let's get back to winning silverware so we can finish the season on a high note, and then have one hell of a send off for our favourite manager!! 🎉🎉🎉
Legend ,thats all l can say  He made Anfield a warzone  Thank you for that ❤
Unai Emery will also be a great replacement as Ange will not leave Spurs. I dont think theres  an English Irish Scottish manager capable of taking over Liverpool at present
😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Plus he doesnt want to pay 100million plus for a player .fucking legend built a statue for this guy he put us back on track .only negative united,city,arsenal,spurs, chelsea will be thinking the will have a chance nw .with his budget and how he  transformed liverpool .it very emotional hard to take .but good luck for future
That’s sports car metaphor was peak
We need to win the league this season with the fans in the ground
Things will never be better than the way they were under Jurgen. It was like Camelot.
I am shoked even though I am man united fan. WE will miss this coach, he is very nice person🇸🇴🇸🇴🇸🇴🇸🇴🇸🇴🇸🇴
Tears from St. Kitts and Nevis of such a Legend.  A statue will be the only satisfying reward.  God Bless you Sir.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Still in shock at the news but one thing is for sure Jurgen Klopp will be remembered as a true great of the club, I can't see his achievements being equalled let alone bettered , whoever gets the job has got some mighty big shoes to fill.
He is obviously really exhausted. I remember his first press conference (October 2015), and look at his face now, he is much much older than he should be.
Sad, sad day....let's hope you end up your stay with a bang!😢❤
@asad:his legacy will always be greatest ever and its not just about trophies
The single most important impact by the Boss was, players wanted to sign with Liverpool, despite not playing in the champions league this season...also missed out on bigger paychecks... some other players followed the money... guided by greed. Not following your heart...feeling the passion, the warmth and the love this manager and the whole city are giving to every single player... to be coached by Jürgen is for some footballers like one of the highlights of their careers. not many clubs are capable of producing so many clutch moments, memories which will last for eternities... comebacks after comebacks on every level. To be honest...the footballworld will not be the same without Jürgen coaching any team... line the NBA when Michael Jordan retired...it just wasn't the same anymore for msny years to come. Well done lad, we will miss you, honor you and keeping you in our hearts...You'll never walk alone... LIVERPOOL
Why is he spoiling my morning
I hope the best german coach will be the next national coach of germany. Maybe in 2025 when he has taken some rest ! GERMANY needs Jürgen !!!
Thank you for everything you have done for the club!!✊🏼🔴 YNWA
😢💔
Best ever, changed us forever - Danke Jurgen, du bist ein Diamant ❤ 😢
Thank you Klopp for all the memories and all the best to you and your family but no one is bigger than the club and the club must go on. Time to bring Xabi back home ❤
Thank you for everything
Where do we go from here
NOOOOOOO 😢
As arsenal fan I've been jealous of Liverpool and klopp , he runs a club perfectly and wins things on a sustainable buget , top man.
Legend for life, you will be missed
“Don’t make these games about me” sorry boss. You’re asking for too much
From Doubters to Believers 🤝🏿
This man has just broke my heart... IV never been so devastated... 😭😭😭😭. What a gloomy day for us as fans.. I personally will miss  his energy, honesty and above all the love and respect he had for Liverpool fans. So long Norbert ...... Your memories will forever be tattooed in our hearts. Much love
Come back home kloppo we miss you @BvB ❤
Very sad from Thailand Fan.
Sad news 💔, YNWA Jurgen
What a man good luck to Jurgen thanks for the memories
What a man!!!What a Gaffer!!! Impossible to forget. Arguably one of the best. We will all certainly miss Jürgen Klopp😢❤❤❤
You'll Never Walk Alone Jurgen.. You are a legend and from now till the day you are no longer managing us, I will support you 110% in every decision you make on-field or off-field. Now let's go win some trophies!!!!!!!!
I was the happiest when Klopp came on board, he's the best thing to happen to LFC in a very long time.  He brought pride back to Anfield. He embodies everything a manager should be.. YNWA!
😭😭😭😭
My guess is that he's going to have a year off and then he'll take over the German national team.
Thanks for everything boss❤
Klopp in , Kim Pang Gon out .Jürgen please come to Malaysia...we even drew with Son's South Korea yesterday..
I fucking love this guy YNWA Jurgen klopp absolute legend
The Bill Shankly of our era
He will join man united 🤣😂
Thank you kloop truly gutted but it been an amazing experience ❤❤❤
Love❤
No matter what you still will be in our hearts we always will remember you thank you for the champions, league, premier league and anything else thank you for everything klopp ❤❤❤❤❤
this guy need a stand named after him. Made many new fans of a liverpool squad made legend by him and his vision. Legend
I've admired you when you were in Dortmund. I've loved you when you were with us. I'll miss you next season and beyond when you're gone 😢. Take a rest, you've earned it, more than anyone, Mr.Klopp, Legend.
I knew one day this would happen but damn this has been so abrupt and too soon🥹💔
He had kept his promise to make Anfield a garden of glories as long past, and he has done that. Respect to the man for he has made Liverpool a great team again. Thank you boss. We will miss you forever.
Build this man a statue
Arsenal fan here and I feel for Liverpool supporters this man built a huge legacy and took Liverpool to the greatness they deserve. He does deserve to rest and his legacy with Liverpool and English football will always live on.
after a long while, jurgen won the premier league for liverpool again. kinda sad he's leaving. he can do more for Liverpool!
Sad one for  us the supporter's😢😢
Thank you Klopp YNWA
Klopp knows the league is rigged with continuous Manchester based refs fixing games, so what's the point. Plus he has owners with their shitty sell to buy policy.
The messiah is leaving! No chance for a proper alternative
total respect to this great manager and man...... hope that any manager thinking of wanting to be the future manager of Liverpool will put this great clubs value over their own ego.... Thinking you are good enough does not make it so..... especially if you don't have the experience .....  Neutral fan, I also love that withing this public announcement there is in my view an element of strategy in that if this doesn't galvanize players fans staff everyone even more to win this season league ... wow my money is on Liverpool for sure now....
His jas of Liverpool his jas of coaching 😂 his mentally drained
'Life' will never be the same again after this man's departure!
Wow
no no
💔
im a man untd fan this is going to be like trying to replace fergie, good luck kloppo will miss your touch line antics.
there is not ONE negative comment here - not ONE. If you googled legend - the german translation should read Jurgen Klopp.....unconditional love is hard to find, you find it only in family. This is Liverpool. This is our BOSS. Goodspeed my dear old friend. You´ll never walk alone. <3
마음이 아프다
Para mi despues del liverpool deberia dirigir la seleccion de alemania es el mayor desafio que puede tener
He could have left when his results started stepping down. But he stayed to try rebuild the team with new ideas. He struggled hard, and he made it. We are doing a great season for now, it would be wonderful if he left on a good note, rather than when the results were hard.  You're a builder You're a thinker We'll always remember you, thanks for everything  You have been the best signing in Liverpool in the 21st century.  Be happy wherever you go, sir Klopp ❤️
What a sad and shocking news, I hope the best for LFC and for you Mr. Heavy Metal
Hurts more than breakup....wish you the best coach❤..YNWA
From a City fan, massive respect for Jurgen, all the best in his future.
I found the club at the start of this season and saw all the smart moves they were making in the transfer market and saw what Klopp meant to the club and decided to support him. We were in the Europa League and people made fun of me for that but I didn’t care and started supporting them. Best decision of my life, we’re still alive in all competitions and I pray to God we can win every single one. Thank you for all the memories, Klopp. YNWA ❤
I feel like I’ve just been dumped… klopp you are a legend and always will be Liverpool
This is heartbreaking. He took the most mature decision, but it's unreal to think that Klopp won't be there anymore...
Thank you Jürgen for everything you've brought to our club. Let's finish this season on a high. YNWA ❤
This man needs  another Epl cup
an amazing manager and man,hopefully pep will be our next manager as its keeps the legacy of jurgen klopp at liverpool,,
YNWA Jurgen! You’ve given us so many special moments! Fair to say I speak on behalf of all Liverpool fans when I say, thank you and we love you. God bless you Klopp! ❤️👏
Please don't get Gerrard in , good player but not a good manager!
❤❤❤😢😢😢
I am barcelona fan I like him he was more than a manager   Yes he had given one heart attack to all barcelona fans that 4-0 defeat But yes one of the greatest manager in EPL .. ❤
Liverpool won’t ever feel the same without KLOPP! He didn’t leave us when Liverpool needed rebuilding, he is leaving after rebuilding Liverpool 2.0. KLOPP will leave Liverpool but Liverpool won’t ever leave KLOPP
Every beautiful thing eventually comes to an end. "It’s not so important what people think when you come in... It’s much more important what people think when you leave”   - Jurgen Klopp
Thank you for everything Jürgen
AFTER COVID & LOSING BOTH PARENTS, HE NEEDS A BREAK. ALL ENGLAND FANS RESPECT him like sir Alf & Shanks & Busby & Clough (even the Manc's). 99% fans want him to go out in a blaze of glory by winning both wembly lg & fa cups & eufa & prem champs. Cmon destiny is calling & no one wants the FFS cheats of pep to win anything❤
100% Honest 100% Legend. Thank you Jurgen. YNWA
I'm not surprised...but what a manager he's been for us and to leave now is the best decision for the club and himself. Atleast he's leaving us in a better situation than Fergie did for man utd..a young squad hungry for success not an ageing one .
😢
Ibhoza yama Bhoza marora
Thank you Klopp for taking us all the way back to the very top 💯
💔
Can we rename the Kop stand as the Klopp?
Thanks for the unforgettable memories Jurgen ❤️ wish it wasn't so but all great things come to an end wish you and your family everything good in life ❤
No matter which club you support you have to love those footballers:  Jürgen Klop N'golo Kante Sadio Mané Karim Benzema Zinedine Zidane Gianluigi Buffon And Mo'Salah
Completly gutted but so proud and really appreciate what you have done for this team! Thx and hope that this year we will manage to get more trophies !
Thank you Jürgen for everything you've brought to our club. Let's finish this season on a high. YNWA ❤
As an Arsenal fan, this came as a shock to me too. Big Thank You to Klopp for gracing the Premier League.
Xabi Alonso incoming
We don't care if you are only half there.   We truly don't care.   You are the only Gaffer for this club.   Please don't go
I'm an Arsenal fan, but have always loved his football philosophy way back from Borussia Dortmund.. good luck Jurgen Klopp
Best Manager! ❤️🐐 Love you Jürgen❤️ Wish you all the best. YNWA
Ugh...😢...I'm so upset.  If this is true what he says and we gotta believe him then we wish him all the best. He was a match made in heaven for us.  You'll always be loved, remembered and revered in the same league as Paisley & Shankly.  Let's give him a few more trophies to leave the club with.
our manager
The downfall of liverpool 😭😭
The hell man, out of no where. jesus
Don’t worry boys… Apparently after lengthy talks, the board has finally reached an agreement with Neil Ruddock!
The  best manager in the history of liverpool football club and the only manager to win the  premier league in a pandemic Tschüss Tschüss  King Klopp YNWA
😢🥺🥺😭 bye klopp
the goat
I am suicidal and don't like life anymore. But you Klopp made my life more pleasant along with many players och the club i loved since 1979.  Hope you and your family the best, and that you can live life to the fullest and happiest with your family.  With that i shed alot of tears for real. But i am happy for you and your descision cause the happiness you gave us Liverpool fans is real from both sides.  You'll Never Walk Alone!
The most heartbreaking news and breakfast.... Anyway, thank you for the great years. You are so much cherished and loved Mr. Jurgen Klopp ❤.
Thank you for everything Klopp. YNWA😢
MAN... I don't know where to start. I'm absolutely guttted. He made us believe we can dream again. I respect his decision but I reckon he should have waited to announce this. Imagine if City get relegated, he could have won the league for years after that but I respect the decision that he feels tired and needs a break. We all do! I love you Klopp, thank you for changing this great club.
All Premier League fan will miss this manager what a fantastic journey 😢😭
King Klopp, we applaud you with every atom 👏👏🏿👏🏻👏🏾👏🏼👏🏽 So grateful for all the joy and energy you brought. We all owe you a massive Klopp-style bear hug at the end of the season. Thank you Jurgen, you really are the best of the best… You’ll never ‘ever’ walk alone 🙏🏽❤️🏆
Pls klopp dont leave us😢😢😢
그동안 행복했다
Klopp going to Bayern ?
Hope the players go on and win the title for him❤❤ He deserves
Hvala majstore za sve ❤ !
Pep has seen him off 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆😂
Doubter to Believer. Thank you Jurgen
One of my favorite managers ever
Bring in Xabi Alonso.
I love you Jurgen, thank you for everything
But whyyyy😢
😭😭😭 We love u 🥰
Jürgen, du bist einfach ein guter Typ. Respekt zum Schritt, und viel Glück bis zum Saisonende und darüber hinaus!
quite emotional- Thanks Jurgen for the beautiful memories. Shall miss the Jurgen pressing style of games
Nah im crying... This man meant more to me than most family members. Thank you Klopp, YNWA. Thank you for everything <3
Thank you Jürgen. YNWA
Ohh Noóooo😢
Thank you boss for the great things you did for our club YNWA
Jurgen, you deserve to have time for your family ...to be ( I presume to be ) a husband to your wife, to be father and to be a grandfather ( not sure on that one ). You have prioritise the remainder of YOUR life and settle your mind for YOUR future; you have given so much to football in general, not only to OUR club. Wishing you longevity for your future pursuits and your family, get some rest Uncle Jurgen, you deserve it!  Potential sporting LFC director ???  😊 No matter what you do ..... in all your endeavours LOVE AND BLESSINGS. YNWA ...WE WILL MAKE A NEW WAY!!!!
Jan 26,2024 18:43 in Thailand I am very shocked to know this news.😢😢😢😢   Klopp , you are Reds forever for me.
Noooo, I knew it will be one day, but it’s too early to accept it. Anyway, I respect his decision.
YNWA😢❤
I'm an Arsenal...but this is just such a classy statement from Klopp! Just shows that he is an utmost professional, giving proper notice for an orderly transition, but he doesn't want the focus of the supporters to be on his resignation.
😭😭😭😢
we all knew this time would come this man has done it all for our club he deserves a break to spend time with his family and rest thank you Jurgen you will be missed you will always be a part of this club and will go down as a living legend YNWA ❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
YNWA
End era
I’ve loved this team since I was a kid. Watching John Barnes and Ian rush, then Robbie fowler, Steve McManaman, Jason McAteer, Jaime Redknapp, Torres, Suarez, Salah, Mane, Jota and many many more great players. It’s a big part of my life. We have had some great managers over the years but none(in my lifetime at least) will ever be held as high in my mind as Jurgen Klopp. What a manager he has been. The success under him has been amazing. Very very sad to hear he is leaving but fully understand why.   Thank you for everything you did
MAY "YOU NEVER WALK ALONE JURGEN  FROM GLASGOW "🍀
First time I felt such a pain in my throat watching this, YNWA Klopp. Thank you for everything you've done for us❤
He done so much for our club cant be mad one of the greatest Liverpool managers ever to be fair one best mangers in football history
Thank you Jurgen. <3
Kloop vc sempre estará em nossos corações te desejo toda sorte do mundo pra vc simplesmente vc mudou o patamar do Liverpool  You"ll never walk Alone ❤  Tragam o Xabi Alonso do Bayer
It’s a very disappointing for the Liverpool manager to make a such decision. Infants Liverpool must look for a replacement as soon as possible in fact I’m shocked. Liverpool must have a replacement not later than Easter. Thanks
Noooooo....... Why did you extend your contract in the first place?! Giving us so much happiness and hope.
Hes going to United 😂😂😂😂😂
"I'm not happy with it; I just know it's right" What an exceptional human being. Not just a football manager. A genuine leader. We were lucky to have him for as long as we did.
Come to Bali and enjoy your hiatus, Jurgen
Love you man 😢
He is the Best manager or coach for Liverpool for ever. Tremendous his all activities. He is the legendary coach and one of the best coach in the world 👌❤️👍 Wishing all the best for you.
breaking heart newsss 💔💔💔😫😫😫
Thank you Jurgen for the emotions!YNWA! With love from Russia!
Picturing LFC without Klopp is like seeing United without Sir Alex! We can only hope we don't have the fall United have had! Klopp is iconic, this is sad news for LFC and Football!
I respect your decision Jurgen. You know the best all the time... thanks for everything
Thank you for everything Boss
No way 😢
🥲
❤💔❤
Pep Lijnders should be in line to replace klopp next season.
😢
Love you ,boss JK
Please Not Stevie G, should be Pep L or then Alonso . Also feel he end up like Shanks who regretted  leaving . The club should put him on the board or offer him job like director of Football for both men/women team  . Take year + off then back
You’re breaking my heart Jurgen!!!!!! 😭😭😭
Please take the ads off this video , this isnt a topic the club should be monitizing....
YNWA❤, You are the greatest and I love you JK
No energy but coincidentally when the energy comes back in 9 months or a year there’s a job offer from Saudi Arabia
Liverpool was a great club before he took in the job, and to maintain it greatness was not an easy task, not only he maintained it, he makes it better. I respected his decision, I can feel his energy is depleting from this interview alone, and lets us give him space to focus up the rest of the season, let him goes out with a bang. Jurgen Klopp will be forever a Legend in Liverpool, and he deserved it. Thanks for everything, and good luck to your future endeavor. Peace out.
Respect Jurgen Klopp🙏🏻 I hope Liverpool will win the title for him.
nooooo, klopp was the best.
Jurgen Klopp is the person I look up to when I need wisdom.   "It's not important what people think when you come in but what they think when you leave" - Jurgen Klopp
Oh no. Thks is the worst news 😢. We have had some of the best managers but Klopp is Liverpool and will always be Liverpool.😢YNWA 💯❤
Even as a Leeds fan. Just wanted to commend what a job this man has done. Revived your club. Will never forget the 2019-2020 period when both of our clubs were back on the way up... you were obviously at the next level. But still to see you lot win the UCL and the league was something I admired.   We felt the same when Bielsa left.  All the best, sure you will go from strength to strength...
No fk way😢😢
Jurgen, we love you, come back one day to us <3
Sad news indeed. All the best to Klopp, his dedication and passion will be missed by everyone.
It Hurts! I know it will be fine but right now it hurts! ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MAN!!!!!!!!!
What klopp did in the last 10 years at Liverpool is mind blowing.. that team with the high press - wingbacks camped in the opposition half and two pivots was often uplayable, forgetting Salah and virgil think about the players who excelled under him.. Gini hendo mane Robertson to name a few what they did against Barcelona will stick in my mind as one of the greatest games I'd seen and even the 4-3 in Europa league where lovern scored.. watch that back gives you shivers and I'm a Boro fan lol
True Icon of Liverpool, we owe him so much. Thanks for everything Jurgen, lets go out with a bang! YNWA ❤
Haire 2to bochhor thakle hoto na
You will always be the man  So come on boys win the league YNWA 😢😢
a very special man, world class manager, world class person, thank you for everything you have done for this club, always a legend forever
Thank you for everything you have done for the club. You will  forever be loved and remembered by everybody connected to the club. ❤
❤❤❤❤
Thank you for everything you did for this club Jurgen. You promised us that we would get better in your wonderful opening day press conference. You delivered. You promised us a Premier League title. You delivered. you promised success in Europe. You delivered. You told us that it mattered more what people said when you left rather than what they said when you arrived. We're devastated and incredibly grateful for the journey you've taken us on. This has been a golden era for Liverpool FC and us as fans.   Every  Liverpool manager for the next 40 years is going to be compared to you. I don't envy them that. What a ride it was and maybe, just maybe, we can finish it with another bunch of triumphs, especially in the Premier League.   I'll always remember your time with us fondly. YNWA.
As a barca fan this guy really knocked us out after we won 3-0 thid guy can make miracles I am seriously wondering what would it feel like without him in prem I hope after his break he joins barca
In his 1st club at mainz, he gave an emotional farewell, 2nd at dortmund Klopp recorded a statement fearing that he would get emotional, now a well planned announcement. All this shows Klopp is an emotional person and that's what separates him other good managers. Respect 🫡
Next Destination : Real Madrid??
All I can say is, Danke, Jurgen.
I'm bloody crying. I'm shattered. We need to win the league again for Jurgen. He deserves a proper parade ❤❤
Beyond grateful for how he transformed the club. You made us believe again. YNWA
💔💔💔
You came as a friend and leave as a friend of Liverpool football club
💔
Cheers Jurgen.
I am a Chelsea fan, but I enjoyed Klopp's presence in the premier and the infectious dynamism between him, the players, and the fans. Anfield came alive with him..those fist pumps
Nooooooooooo
Absolutely gutted
United fan here, but that was honest, humble and graceful. You need to be in a certain place in life, physically, mentally and spiritually, to make a decision to quit at the top of your game, and to be certain that it is the correct decision for all, which I think he made a great case for here. Good luck and enjoy your sabbatical/semi-retirement Jurgen.
Thanks for the 9 years you brought for Liverpool... All the best whatever comes next and the LFC will miss you after the last game of 23/24 season. YNWA. 🥲❤️
21 years being in love with this club, but only with Urgen i was happy and now it fell's like a divorce. it's been a minute, thank you the normal one! the incredible the exceptional! Ours Urgen! YNWA!
Thanks for the ride Jurgen, its been a pleasure to have you as our manager YNWA
The man who changed from doubters to believers...i respect his decision, but it's heartbreaking for me, nothing but respect Boss.. Danke Klopp. YNWA😢❤
I remember before Arsenal match this season, Klopp said he wasnt happy with Liverpool Fans these days.
😩😭Klopp YNWA❤ These are the best football days I have seen in my life because of you, REAL FOOTBALL MAN ❤
Had me in tears finding out this news 😔
Thank you Jürgen.
Absolutely gutted.   Thought he was in for the long haul.  Say it ain't so .   Im From Boston and have never been to Anfield.  I'm broken hearted and extremely ashamed at myself.   Been supporting the club since 2005 when I almost committed suicide.   Almost 20 years I have not missed a game.   You'll Never Walk Alone saved my life.    Im so empty rn.
Oh My God I am so Sad. Devastated.. 😭. Moreover hearing the reasons makes me realize how big Klopp is for the Club...😢. We are always with you wherever you will be. YNWA
Jurgen is and will forever be football class, I don't see many other managers giving such a heartfelt explanation, the fact is as he said despite being the best coach in the world in my opinion he's also just a fella, I've been there before when your just emotionally drained, I wish nothing but joy for this awesome human being. What he's done for the club is a legacy which will last forever and I can't help but wish the man so much joy in his life for bringing so much joy to ours.
Thank you for everything boss, we will never forget. YNWA ❤
Brilliant  manger thank you
No No No!!!!
Please god no im heartbroken
I am heartbroken 💔
😭😭😭😭 YNWA KLOPP
Whom did you think can handle this club again.
😢
Obviously got the Real Madrid job lined up
Gutted absolutely gutted They’ll be anyone else out they’re as good as Jürgen  He’s been a revelation at Liverpool FC THEY’RE HAS TO BE A STATUE OF HIM ERECTED OUTSIDE ANFIELD!!! Hes Mr Liverpool  He’s Bill Shankly inside a German body… What won achieved how he changed the dynamics of the club We love you Klopp & thank you  You’ll Mever Walk Alone
GOAT 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
This is not yet a goodbye. YNWA
Build this man a statue
Ich kenne wirklich niemanden, der es geschafft hätte so einen menschlichen und authentischen Abgang zu machen. In Zeiten wie diesen gibt es kaum wirkliche Vorbilder. Aber Jürgen Klopp ist definitiv das Einhorn. Meinen größten Respekt!
No way. I follow Liverpool because of this man.
Danke 😢
As a manunited fan, this guy is a legend. His passion, his tactics, his style of play, his character. One of the best.
Gutted. You have to do what’s right for you Jurgen and YNWA. I’m so glad that you’re a red!
We love you jurgen! Thank you for everything! Let’s hope this season can be one to never forget! Let’s go and win all the cups and the premier league 1 final time🔴 YNWA
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, pls don't go, dont'go away. Respect to anything you choose Jurgen and thank you
Jurgen. Thank you for making me fall in love with football. My dream of watching the boys play at anfield under you will never come true. ❤YNWA.
Nahhh man Jurgen Klopp is like the father of Liverpool.... without there will always something missing in Liverpool
Wow What a Shock, Feels like Someone has Died. He will be missed a Real Character, But am totally Devastated.  Lets Go out on a high and win the League. Jurgen Your a Topman. YNWA
This is what happens when you don’t back your manager. Arteta has been given way more money than this proven winner. What he’s done with Liverpool is crazy and he hasn’t been rewarded or given “unlimited” funds. Sad to see him leave
Thanks Jurgen❤
Break my heart...
What the hell!!!!! 😫😫😫😭😭😭😭
Legend!
Germany is waiting for you, welcome back Jürgen
Why we top of the league
❤
So happy about this. Sallah will aso leave. Liverpool will return to what they really are Looserpool 😂
Liverpool prepare to suffer more 8 seasons without qualifying for champions league😂😂😂😂
If you belief Alonso should be Klopp's replacement hit the like
Bon voyage, Jurgen.
Thank you Jurgen Klopp. Danke!. your legacy will forever be cherished.  Liverpool win the Premier League + ALonso wins it for Bayer Leverkusen, and he takes over. Champions transfer!!!
I became a Liverpool fan because of this man. He created such a lovely atmosphere and bond between players, like a head of a family. Thank you Jürgen! <3
Thank you Jurgen, we love you.....
Hes going to manage Germany next, surely. I think current German boss contract is up in 2024.
Can't believe he is going honestly but what an amazing guy. "Wow" as he says it 😂 You'll never walk alone Klopp
I have no words 😢  Just thank u Jurgen ❤
What a man x
หลายปีที่ผ่านมา ดูฟุตบอลได้สนุกมาก นั่นเพราะมีคล็อปป์ ต่อไปนี้ไม่รู้จะเป็นอย่างไรต่อ😢
He could have kept quiet till the end of the season…..this may affect the players and fans… we still have a lot of games to play…..
Once a red always a red love you Jürgen YNWA
Well, sincerely thanks for making me fall right back in love with the club.   I always supported Liverpool, even when it was rough (flashbacks to school times)  But you completely changed that and made us a club to fear with a unique style of play.  Thank you so much and can’t wait to see who your successor is
Don't know how the club will go with the Americans. But Jurgen Klopp, You Will Never Walk Alone. You are simply the Best !
As a die-hard Liverpool fan this is truly heartbreaking news. Jurgen has made this club great again and he has a true legend of the club. Wherever he goes Liverpool blood will forever flow though his veins and he will be celebrated at Anfield forever.
Legend all the best
I can't even think about what the club looks like in the future. Gutted.
He loves this club, fans and players but he’s getting tired from doing this job for a long period. We understand his decision and wish him best of luck. YNWA Jurgen❤️‍🩹😊
Thank you for everything. Being Japanese, I'm worried about Endo after Klopp leaves the job. hope he won't be treated like Kagawa.
Everything has its end. This man will be always in our heart for what he brought us in the past few years. Wish him all the best in the coming future.
Oh Captain, my Captain!  YNWA❤
This is a sad day in English premier league, regardless of the team you support.
Now as an Arsenal  fan i want them to win the league😩
Jürgen Klopp do you want to be the next German kanzler / president please?
welcome Alonso
Jürgen, you will forever have a place in the heart of every Liverpool fan!  Thank you so much ❤
Thank you for all the memories Jürgen YNWA Sir❤
i have been following liverpool for my entire life. My father passed mere months before we lifted the cup. Klopp will in my opinon be one of the greatest EPL coaches of my lifetime. As the song says " Build the man a statue and put him on the throne, cause wherever you end up my friend, You'll Never Walk Alone". Farewell Jurgen, you have made us believe again.
I’m so sad… damn
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?????   DON'T OUUUUUUUUT KLOPP
I'm so sad about this news. I get it, but still, this is horrible. I just hope he can leave getting all 4 titles
I was dreaming to visit Liverpool to see Jürgen on the bench of the Anfield. I'm really sad to miss his energy on the team. Danke Jürgen, you will be missed all the time.
What a loss for the premier league
So...does he retire or does he just leave liverpool?
Even as a United fan, Klopp will be missed in the Premier League. What a manager he has been. A legend of the club.
I'm a United troll of course but seriously, Klopp has been fantastic, one of the best. I'll gladly admit that I have often wished that we had got Jurgen Klopp, a top top manager.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.  YNWA
Wehn kloop leavs than must we sign a coach taht can win and play like kloop
At the end of the storm, there's a legend who will always be in our hearts Jurgen klopp ynwa
Thank you Mr Klopp❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
his going to AC Milan or Barcelona
😢😢😢
🐐
I love him, understand and respect this big decision. Finally, I wish every Liverpool match. It is a reward for your hard work. I wish you success this season. Love you, Boss.
Please klopp come to real Madrid
Arsenal fan here. I have nothing but respect for this Man. He deserves a massive farewell and a statue in front of the stadium, so high so it could be seen from Manchester. What a legend   I share your pain Liverpool fans. Shocked this day has come so soon. too soon
First, it was Firmino now it's Klopp...it's really sad seeing this happen (from an Arsenal fan)
we love you boss!  YNWA
As an arsenal fan we will   miss you but I just have one request please win the efl cup against Chelsea please
Thank you Jürgen.  YNWA ❤
the most German answer imaginable "I will leave".
Thank you Jurgen❤
He's managed the most potent forward line in Europe..
I'm a United fan but Klopp is one of a kind really going to miss him🥲
He doesn’t want to do a Wenger and  have the fans wanting  him to  leave.
Xabi Alonso please. Young and bags of energy for the next 8 years. 🍻 Klopp, thanks for what you've done and just like football, we move on 😂
Have to question what's wrong with the game or what's happening/coming to the game that makes an elite manager in his prime need to take a year off! He's taking a huge gamble because of how fast the game moves on, but I can see him taking over German national team or Spain as he'd dominant Spanish league and it's easier.  Devastated to be losing an iconic manager, its not just a loss to LFC its a loss to the league! If they win some trophies this season it'll end on a perfect high but I genuinely don't believe LFC will be able to replace him, I can see LFC losing its heart for a couple seasons, managers like Klopp are super rare and any potential manager knows they're stepping into his shadow, look how man united fell after Sir Alex. I wish klopp nothing but love and respect and I hope he finds whatever it is he's looking for in his time off, hard to imagine LFC without Klopp ❤
Devastated. And yet thats the healthiest, most mature exit announcement i've ever seen. SO much respect for this guy, there's not another manager like him.
Thank You Jurgen! YNWA ❤️
Jurgen Klopp, he's up there with Bill Shankly. I hope to see him in the stands in the future. 2015-2024, JK, thanks for the memories!
This cant be happening. Please Juergen. DONT LEAVE
Noooooo😢😢
Man I was rewatching so many highlight games and Jürgens reactions this past week and now this comes up. Maybe the algorythm Is actually able to see into the future
Club legend for sure, thanks for all your work jk
Some of the best memories under klopp time ..great games ,great teams brought back Liverpool pride and belief..thanks for everything Jurgen..let's get that title before you go ❤
If he's gonna it's a good time to let ppl know. I think the players will now want to go out on a high and win him as much as possible ❤
pls didn't do this to us it feels like someone close died, pls don't go, take a leave for 1 year let Pep take the job and u return after 1 year pls don't do this, the worst possible news as a Liverpool fan😭😭😭😭
I am sure he will not go to another club after Liverpool. I think after a break he will go for his last dream to be the german national coach. He will always be a legend in every club he was in. Maybe the only coach who was never been fired by a club. Great person, great career. RESPECT for his honesty and to give the club the chance to get a young coach early enough. Maybe it will be Steven Gerrard! Hope so! I wish him and the team all possible titles this year, but even if this will not happen, he will go as a hero!
Completely rejuvenated the entire club. Get a statue outside the Kop.  YNWA
We love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Brighton fan with respect, sad to hear the news. Fantastic manager and top bloke. Big, big hole to fill. Wish you guys well and success for his last season. YNWA.  P.S. Please don't look in our direction for your new manager 😎
😢😢
I love JK❤❤❤❤
Klopp is a legend and I will support him anywhere he goes
Xabi Alonso ??????.
Heartbreaking news
He's managed the most potent forward line in Europe..
I am in tears, end of an era. Thank you so much for everything Jurgen Klopp.  YNWA ❤
Alonso for consideration please and not Gerrard.
Liverpool's greatest signing
Hahahahahaha Liverpool are back 😂😂😂😂😂
8 years is longtime for football manager to be at same club for that length of time.
Xabi Alonso here we go
Please come to Ajax ❌❌❌
Klopp is a Liverpool Legend forever! 🔴🔴
Plssss nooooooooooooooooo😢😢😢😢😢😢,😭😭
He's going to OT
I’m heartbroken, One of the greatest managers ever!!!
Thank you  I love everything you have done for this club. YNWA
Thank you Jurgen Norbert Klopp. You made me a believer. This journey you have taken with LFC has been one of incredible highs and difficult lows but all the way through it we supported you, your vision and your team. The next manager that follows you has one hell of a job to do now to even come close to replicating what youve achieved. Thank you JK. Now lets win the lot and give you the only worthy send off you deserve!! ❤
Legendary.
YNWA. The Liver bird is flying on the wind that is Klopp. Everyone flocks to support this great manager, great man. Respect. Thank you.
Thank you for everything Boss❤ Let’s attack all the trophies now COME ON REDS
I can't believe in that. It was the best work, it is the best manager and human. It is hard but, you should take a rest LEADER. Thanks for everything. That news makes me cry... But I can understand.
As a longtime Mainz fan: lots of love and respect for you, Kloppo.
YNWA❤. A end of an era to one of the greatest manergers of this generation. A hero, A legend, An Icon...Jurgen klopp❤
No No you can't leave us
Pain 😢
If klopp leaves I’m leaving too! Goodbye football 😭
The man that made me fall in love with football. Thank you Jurgen Klopp ♥️
True legend of the club ❤
Devastated but understand fully. Nicest most honest and hard working man I've ever had the privilege of witnessing. Truly irreplaceable in this day and age! We can all learn a lot from this great man. Thank you Jurgen.
Forever Our Boss Jürgen Norbert Klopp❤
BOSS.
Don't be sad because it's over; smile because it happened. Thank you, Sir.
I know it's early days but Alonso is the man I would love to see replace Klopp
Absolutely heartbreaking to watch, can't think of the very last game we're going to watch when he's managing our club that he has built single-handedly since the day he came which undoubtedly stands out as so brilliant, competing, and extremely exhilarating to watch. After all these years, this day had to come, it is what it is. He has won us everything there is and is still hungry for more and more forever. Built his statue out of Anfield immediately. YNWA Jurgen❤
time to bring in Xabi Alonso
Best luck sir
ohhh no
Jurgen has done a fabulous job but, like any elite athlete, no one can last forever. The team continues to the get better & the best managers in the world will fight to take over from the great man. YNWA
Best manager of all time !! Strong courageous but also humble and honest !! Qualities you rarely see today!! Well done  Jurgen !! YNWA ‘remember your creator in the days of your youth before the difficult days come ‘ Do something of eternal value!!
Thanks- you. Take care of your health.
You will never walk alone ❤❤❤❤ My boss ❤❤❤
Where ever Klopp has been working, he always can come back. Leaving at this time is a fair decision. He will leave the club in a perfect situation. Starting a job includes always the leaving. Liverpool will always my favorite foreign club. Greetings from Germany.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
YNWA ! KLOOPITE forever!
Absolute, genuine LEGEND ♥
This current team must give this man a quartet title as send off. He deserves it unconditionally
I don't know what to say. I'm shocked.
❤️❤️❤️
He's off to coach Germany... it's clear...
Thank you Kloppo for all until now!!!👏💪 But there is a job to do this season…we can win first of all the premiere league. I think the team and the club is stable, hungry and commited enough…and we have a great young team again. Kloppo has built it up…so let‘s go for the title(s). Perhaps this decision sets free the last percent point to beat City…City has to be punished for breaking the financial fairplay rule over years and the only Club, who can do this, is the LFC with his great team and manager.
Gutted hes going, he will leave a legend and probably manage Germany in the future. Turned us all from doubters to believers, BOOM
Goodbye Legend.  You Will Never Walk Alone❤❤
Love and respect to Jurgen and Liverpool FC. YNWA ❤
Absolute legend of the club. Not surprised though, as soon as Julian ward announced hi departure barely one year into his role, I knew exactly the pressure on klopp would be a bit too much for him to take. Anyways, good luck to him for his future endeavours. YNWA
Today is a sad day, hopefully we will have a proper farewell with the Premier League title in our hands. This man deserves it 100000% for what he did here. YNWA!
❤
YNWA klopp
Wrong decision. Understandable, but the wrong decision.
😢😢😢
WIN the quadruple and dip 🫣 that's the way to go
There is hope for german football again
Thank you for being our only coach to win a premier league YNWA❤
Huhuhuhu
Incredible manager. And a great man. Will be missed.
We are Liverpool! Thank you Jurgen. YNWA!
He has won more major honours in his time with us than Man United, Spurs and Chelsea.  He has almost single-handedly transformed this club and to go toe to toe with Man City like they have done shows plenty of testicular and intestinal fortitude. You’ll never be forgotten Jurgen. ❤️
All LFC fans we need to unite - let’s get the club to put up a statue of him in his honour  - this man has been our hearts and minds out on that pitch , he’s delighted and delivered so much for us as fans of LFC and for the fans who are fans of football. His last game , every club every fan should stand and applaud this guy . As a LFC fan I’m very concerned to hear Klopp and his entire team are leaving . That’s not just a manager going that’s the heart of the club .
Bayern munich bound within 12 months of leaving Liverpool watch
YNWA❤
Brilliant man.....❤
Самая ужасная новость за долгое время. Боюсь, что закончилась светлая полоса у клуба YNWA
Thanks liverpooll but Liverpool its liverpoool
From South Africa 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦  we say 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 goodbye and thank you for your good job. 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
There will be kids who've never known anything but Klopp, who'll be heartbroken, i was the same when Shankly resigned, but Klopp is leaving behind a great legacy just like Shanks, he's a Liverpool legend already, maybe he didn't win as much as Bob Paisley but his connection with the supporters is second to none. Whatever happens this season thanks some great memories Jurgen.
Its time to look for potential manager, Xabi alonso or xavi or carlo or ...?
I'm literally crying watching this fucking heart broken 💔YNWA respect Herr Klopp👏💯♥️
Poor Liverpool :( Does this mean Germany will win the world cup in 20206?
What a guy. Has been such a great manager and leader for the club, revitalising them and rebuilding twice.  Knowing when to step away to actually enjoy life while you can and are healthy is a brave and wise decision.  All the best to Jurgen and his family
❤
I just hope health wise he is ok early on he did look like he lost weight  i really believe this will be LFC struggling now to get in the top six never once has he been giving big money without selling players and because its easy option knock the manager when things are not going well to them fans lets see where LFC go now and to the silly fans who are talking about jose mourinho give your head a shake lost for words how much i think of klopp wont be replaced
No kloppo pls don't leave 😭
LEGEND❤  I’m crying 😢😢😢
I can’t remember the last time I cried like this.  Juergen owes nobody anything yet he has given so much. He took on one of the hardest roles possible and did it with class and grace, something that he will undoubtedly continue to do right to the end of his tenure at Liverpool and beyond. His character is beautiful and I can’t imagine that this has been easy on him and the fact that the club has performed so well between his announcement to the board and now is a testament to his character.  I feel torn between anger and understanding knowing full well that my anger is selfish. The understanding is remembering that this person who I see as a God is just a man with a family wanting to see more of the world and to be honest, if that’s what will make him happy for now, then get out there Klopp and live a little, you have earned it.   You’re a special one mate, you have touched more people in this world in ways you will never be able to comprehend, thank you for everything you’ve done.
I am shocked. However, for me is the best manager but also a philosopher of football and life !!!! Thank Juergen Klopp for everything you have done for us. Wishing you health and happiness for the rest of your life. You are already a Legend !!!!!! Ich danke dir.......
You will never walk alone. Thank for everything. My legend forever Jurgen Klopp.
Jurgen, why not take rest for two years, let Ljinders n Kwia manage n come back in 25-26?
One of the best, if not the best manager in the world. He did amazing work with LFC laying the down the foundations for future generations. Good luck and best wishes for his future
Worst day of my life
Probably pissed off , fighting against corruption .
Best Manager! ❤️🐐 Love you Jurgen❤️ Wish you all the best. YNWA
💔💔💔
So Sad 😞
😢😢😢
FOOTBALL IS LOSING A LEGEND 😢
The best german coach...maybe not because of how many titles he won but he is a class act and a person with the right mindset. Sounds normal but in Football there are just a few of these persons left. Hats off, big respect Jürgen!!!  Best regards from Bremen, Germany 💚🤍
As I'm writing this i have tears in my eyes , thank you Jurgen for giving us the power to believe again ❤
😥
😢 I am shocked to hear that! Thank Jurgen YNWA!
Our boys better win all our remaining games for him. Give their hearts on the pitch for this man. Thank you for your service to the club.  Love all the way from Malaysia. YNWA Klopp.
Sad day 😢
Traitor why leave as right now🫠🫠🫠
As a person who has nothing but love for you Jürgen I totally understand your decision and your thoughts on living life. I am heartbroken but I can only hope that you have some incredible adventures while exploring  life and days filled with lots of love and laughter. YWNA! Much love Gerald
I work with a Man U fan , he's well happy . What does that show you?
This is a lad’s equivalent to taylor swift breaking up with her new boyfriend 😢
Barca need to get there finger out and forget player transfers 😮
😢
Thank you for everything. ❤
Best of luck to him with his future. He has built a legendary team and deserves his break.
Can’t wait to see the bin dippers without him. Haha.
💔💔💔
He will be back for the next World Cup for Germany 😅
Who's manager can the become coach liverpool🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿???
Does the executive board not fully support him? It's so tiring.
For a moment, I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me when I saw the headline! I guess the dreaded day is finally here! Goodness WE HAD A BLAST!!
Statue will be needed
Why he tells at this moment 😡
IM A COVENTRY FAN BUT IVE ALWAYS LIKED LIVERPOOL & EVEN MY SON DOES AND HE WILL BE GUTTED AS AM I THAT JURGEN IS GONNA GO 😢 💙👏⚽️
You will always be welcome wherever you are.
man im sad rn who will replace klopp? 😢
He is a legend his legacy is unmatched. Build him a statue. But the future for Liverpool will be super bright as now they have a chance to get Xabi Alonso who will dominate world football with his idea of football
Klopp out Zidane in
Devastated.  Jurgen was a generational manager
Nothing but the utmost respect for a true gentleman of the game. Liverpool should prepare an amazing goodbye at the end of the season and just make him a statue. He deserves it, he was fundamental for the uprise that the club had and was running after for 3 decades. The only one to trully challenge Guardiola's supremacy, that, by itself is worthy.
I’m so sad, I’m really upset. 😢😢😢😢😢
I love Jurgen Klopp, and I say that as an Arsenal fan. Top, top, top manager. I've had the conversation with mates where we said which manager would we love to play for had we been professional. They went for Pep, but for me it would be Klopp all day long. Bet he gives better hugs an' all.
Tamk of lla john
Him going feels like a part of my childhood is leaving, grew up watching him take my club out of decades long slump, I'm not so optimistic about the future is all I can say 😞
TEGA BANGET 😢😢😢
I respect your decision. Thank you for rebuilding our club. YNWA ❤
He looks so sad , he really loved this club.
Devastated beyond words.  Legend is a word often bandied about too often but in this case 'legend' just doesn't cut it. Thank you Jurgen! ❣
Boss, do what’s good for Jurgen!
Jesus… tearing up here
Alonso incoming
احا احا احاااااااا
It's unimaginable, this day has finally come but it comes too soon, without Klopp on the coaching staff, it's so heartbreaking... oh my heart😢
He gave his let's release him
I am absolutely gutted let's go out with a bang Jurgen and win the lot
Is he completely leaving football or just Liverpool?  I am confused 😕😢
😭
Xabi Alonso is rubbing his hands right now. 😂  Klopp, what a legend!
It’s sad to see the 1 manger of all time leaving us he might come back in a later season tho maybe
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened ❤️
I’m looking for words to express how I feel about this news, but we all know Klopp has Liverpool in his heart, YNWA Liverpool fans 🫡❤️
"My coaching and managing style is based on energy, and if that's not there Im not the same and if that's not the same I cannot do it".  Huge respect to such winning mentality. Love you Klopp!
😢😢😢
From an Arsenal fan this is actually quite sad to hear😔, I take no pleasure in hearing this news. The man is a great manager and this is a brave decision which is obviously personal to him, you are lucky to have had him. I wish him all the best!
Let's bring home the PL this year, he deserves it.
No way. I became a Liverpool Fan since my childhood again because of him. :(
The Liverpool version of sir Alex Ferguson everyone
How unfortunate for the premier league, I’m an Arsenal fan, but it’s good that klopp is going whilst he is still class and you don’t have to go through the pain of watching your legend of a manager fall from grace. Hopefuly you guys win a trophy to send him off on a high
Build the man a statue
MY MANAGER!!! Thanks for everything you have done for the Club and us Fans. U have done more for us than u can ever know! If Jurgen Klopp tell us its time. Then its time,BUT its not over yet! One more push one more fight!!! Lets do it for Jurgen!!!! ..We have been very lucky to have u at our Club. Statue anyone?? Love you Jurgen!!! YNWA!! ❤
All great managers leave at their prime. He was a great Manager a Liverpool legend.
Is it a dream? Tell me that's not real
Pure class as always. Really hope that he's in a good space.
He's literally irreplaceable.......
No 😭 Well then guys, if this really IS the decision, you players just HAVE to give your best to try to win all the trophies you are competing for. YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE
Thank you for everything boss❤️
Liverpool  luck good john
it won't be the same Liverpool anymore. It's a shock.😢😢 I was counting on him to fulfill the contract. Watching him at the helm of the Reds for so many years. You get the impression that he's not an inseparable part of Liverpool, that it just has to be like that, that it's a perfect combination. Moreover, it's like he treats the fans, players, the entire staff and employees of the club. Or how he behaves after a home match when running up to The Kop... I don't see anyone else worthy of being Liverpool's manager at the moment. He should have his own monument.I hope he will change his mind👏
❤❤❤
makasi bang klopp
Please build this guy a statue we need it as liverpool supporters
Without him premier league would be an 1 horse  race many years ago this guy saved  the premier league and our Liverpool Fc as well huge respect for Jürgen Klopp wish you a wonderful years ahead . Best wishes for  next chapter of your life. Thank you for everything ❤️ . We are Liverpool 🔴, you will never walk alone.  . . Thank you for everything 🤝
Feel sorry for jurgen if the man wants to leave good on him he knows what's right for him and his family 😮
Pep Lijnders for manager!
We need Tony Pulis to take this club forward!
thank YOU ❤
Such a sad day for Liverpool Football Club and it's supporters worldwide. But all good things come to an end. For the joy and  energy that Klopp brought to the Club we have to thank him. He will forever be in our hearts. YNWA❤❤❤GOD BLESS YOU Mr Klopp.
Please sign Pep Ljinders as the next manager
Why didn't he have a break a year or two ago? THen come back? Could well have prevented all this.
I don't know how to take this information, I feel so sad, but it is what it is. It was fun while it lasted, thank you Jurgen! YNWA ♥
He's done a great job with limited resources so Thanks for the incredible job he's done and best of luck in the future
Please, win the Premier League title for this man 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
He said it in his comments - he was the Right One - never mind the Normal One - was just so much the Right One. Hope the succession plan is in place and is as good an appointment as his was. Good Luck and very best wishes Jurgen ... the rest of the season is business as usual for you and will be bitter sweet for fans. Hardly care about silverware as long as the team play with joy and give 100%. Inspirational man and part of Anfield folklore now , the world wide club will remember you forever.
Awaiting LFC to announce Xabi Alonso as our next manager
Why the other managers also leaving , whys pep leaving
I just wish he would of got us a  new Allison 2.0 before leaving
😭😭😭😭😭
Aku sedih polll pak dhee ko isooo ,3 sasi neh yokena toh pakdhe😢
Say to me that this video was created by a AI!!!!! Noooooo
Give it too pep liingders ., he knows the team and the way we play already
I'm not crying, it's just windy today...😢
TT
WHY ALL OF SUDDEN????? WHY???????? WHAT'S GOING ON??????
I feel like he underachieved. And I mean that as a compliment, if that makes sense.
My Boss. Thank you for everything , Your passion for football and our club is outstanding. YNWA ♥
This is genius, this will push the crowds, the players, all the staff to win everything this season! WE LOVE YOU JÜRGEN YNWA!!!!!
Klopp is Liverpool, Liverpool is Klopp! ...How!? 😭
An incredible manager and an incredible person. He turned us from doubter into believers and he gave us memories that will last life times. Thank you Jurgen, for everything.  You'll Never Walk Alone.
Interviewer should have asked him have the pressures increased with extra games and demands. Was that a factor?
Klopp❤❤❤🫡🫡🫡👏👏👏
I'm genuinely heartbroken. This is legitimately how it feels to be heartbroken. Thank you so much Jurgen. I absolutely love you
Please LFC Player, win everything for his tribute!
I heard that he's doubling his money and coming to United!
Crying tears of red into my Carslberg...
Gracias por tanto !!! ❤
اظن انه مريض بالسرطان وراح يتعالج في اشاعات انه راح يدرب المنتخب الالماني
Sign Jose Mourinho for next year!
Lets hope the club won a trophy this season as proper farewell to him, a liverpool legend
Great JK 👍🏻 YNWA
I cannot see him managing any other top clubs in Europe.. After leaving us can you please manage Germany or any other nations but not any clubs 😕😕
He is irreplaceable…
No No Noooooo😢 Jürgen Klopp. Please stay 🙏
Heartbroken & crying for real 😭 I don't think I was prepared for this day! Vielen dank, Jürgen; we love you! ❤
you will always be in our heart klopp ynwaa❤
Absolutely devastated. BUILD THIS MAN A STATUE.
Thank you Jurgen❤
I am not a long Liverpool FC fan when I felt this is right club He was there he is the reason I loved this club  I enjoyed each and every moment  I felt I will never wanted him to leave even we get relegated. 💔💔💔💔
now the question is, who is the most worthy of talking his place at Liverpool🤔.
It’s hard, it’s heartbreaking, but we understand, boss. We fully support your decision and truly appreciate what you’ve done for us. YOU’ll NEVER WALK ALONE JURGEN NORBERT KLOPP ❤🙌🏾 Just perfectly how he put in at the end of this announcement, Lets go for it all towards the end of the season 💪🏾💪🏾
You will never walk alone klopp😿
The intellect of a professor, a master communicator, a master motivator, and a genuine person. Special guy.
YNWA Jurgen! <3 Will be forever greatful.
I’m a Leeds fan and I’m sad to hear this news but I totally respect this man and have loved observing his magnificent work. It must be exhausting for him. All my best wishes to a great man and love to him and his family ❤️
No man can replace jurgen klopp
What a legend. Best manager they've had. All the best to Klopp. A sincerely great guy.
Great coach 😃✌🏻
As a coach, I respect him on the same level as Guardiola, Ancelotti, Mourinho. I know he did a fantastic job at Liverpool. He turned the players into "animals" who want to win every match and every trophy at all costs. I know what he achieved with Liverpool and what level he took it to. Personally, I think that Jurgen would be a good fit for Barcelona, ​​which after recent years is in a very big crisis and needs someone who can hold the locker room by the throat and tell them how to play. I would like to see that "spark" in his eye because he deserves it. And I wish you, dear Reds fans, victory in this season of the Premier League. enjoy your coach and you will thank him at the end. See you. Hello 🤘
You’ve made me cry for 25 minutes listening to this. I’d hoped after this seasons rebuild you’d sign another mega contract and stay for years to come. Devastated is an understatement but your supporters will absolutely respect your decision. You are Liverpools greatest ever signing and You’ll Never Walk Alone.
Best wishes to you klopp, thank you for making us from being a doubter to be a believer. A legend! 🙏
Owners of the team they're failing to sign mbappe that's why klopp his leaving, you see now your stingy ness
Terimakasih Jurgen Klopp untuk semua energi yang diberikan. Menyelamatkan Liverpool FC dari keterpurukan & membawa Liverpool FC kembali berjaya, Terimakasih banyak Boss.❤❤❤  Klopp | LFC | YNWA
Saddest day in the history of the club 😢 He deserves a statue in front of the stadium, if he doesn't get a statue i'll be quite upset with the owners and the club
I'm crying. My best footballing memories are with Klopp at the helm. The thought of Klopp not being here is unimaginable. A part of me is gutted, and I know it sounds selfish, but for him to put himself first is really brave and conscientious. From his first day, until his final day, his actions have been, and will, no doubt, continue to be, in the best interest of Liverpool Football Club .  He may have arrived as 'normal,' but he leaves an extraordinary ambassador for the club and the city of Liverpool. YNWA.
When you fall in love with what you do for the club. You care so much, and let the club go, for the club's better future. 😢😢😢
Fucking Love You ❤ YNWA
Klopp you're a legend  YNWA
Something dodgy’s happened here
They need to get hansi flick
We are devastated 💔 we wish you the best of luck in the future Jurgen. Thankyou for your honesty and for all you have done for us you will be greatly missed and never forgotten. Forever a legend up there with Shankly and Paisley.
THE GOAT! God bless Jürgen Klopp 🙏
Congratulations on a superb management tenure Jurgen! Respect from a West Ham fan.
Jurgen deserves a statue. The man is a giant and should be respected and honoured. Jurgen YNWA 🤗
this has to be health related, the constant stress of being a PL manager (on him and his family) is something I don't think anyone other than a manager can comprehend and if he stayed he is probably working himself into an early grave.  Hope he can go away, recharge and then if he wants return as he is without a shadow of a doubt one of the greatest managers in history. Remember Pep did the same when he left Barca, taking a one year sabbatical in NY.
Its like your favorites youtuber retiring but a million times worse  😭😢😢😢
So sad
🥺🥺🥺whyyy
Klopp is the best thing to ever happen to me💔
All the best Mr klopp simple the best thank you
YNWA ❤ 😮😢
Alonso
Nah man this is so heartbreaking for us Liverpool fans 😢 i can't take this
GOAT
Thanks very much Coach Klopp 🙏
My man...Thank you very much for everything you've done for this club and mostly for bringing back LFC to its greatness...YNWA ♥
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤧🤧🤧🤧
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Totally devastated the man gave us hope gave us success and now I just don’t know what’s next for us and the club. Who can lead us now. At the moment I’m just devastated. Thank you boss you made us believe
He's not really happy with this decision. I just hope the woke brigade arent taking over this club being American owners and all. Thats all I hope
No please im Crying right now🥲🥺😔
Thank you, herr Klopp, youre amazing❤
1st class interview from a 1st character who football in general will miss, for a year anyway 👏 👍 👏
Frankly life as a Liverpool fan without Klopp is not something that I even want to contemplate. As I watch this, I realise that I have become even more of a fan of Klopp FC than I ever was of LFC. Not sure I'll even be able to watch another game after he leaves 😢
Klassic Klopp 😢 I’m not even a Liverpool fan & I respect 🫡 this moment entirely.
as a football fan .it pains
The guy who brought us back 🔥 Thankyou for everything jurgen I’m not crying you are!
That is sad
Super coach 🔥Greater man🤝🏾
So much respect, for not just a Fantastic manager, but a Great man.  Enjoy some well deserved timeout with the family. Thank you JK   YNWA   ❤
Get a statue made for this guy as he's a legend. Good luck to him in the future and hope he's happy whatever he made do.
Even If you are not a Liverpool fan then you must love this man were gonna miss you next season Jürgen ❤❤❤
No way no way. Tell me this is a joke 😭😭😭😭
I am not joking and I know that I am a new fan just started loving Liverpool since Feb last year but I am completely in love with this club and this man was the reason I started loving this club. Devastated from listening this news even if it is a journey of just a year but this news just hit hard I was on the brink of crying I never thought this day would come this early for me. Good luck for him in this future and hoping to win silverware to give him a good farewell. Love you Jürgen ❤❤❤ YNWA
The Kop for Klopp YNWA❤
We love you and support you x
Devastated. It feels like the good times is coming to an end. This man was a giant.
As long as he doesn't reappear in Saudi Arabia or - beware - in Munich next season.
As a fan i never thought this time will come... It's very heartbreaking 😢
It’s a truly terrible day for rain for us Liverpool fans, this man has defined an era at this club and now it’s coming to an end. He came to this club and rebuilt it by himself with limited resources and created a winning team. He is Liverpool through and through, no matter what coach replaces him, whether or not we win more or less trophies, there will only ever be one Jürgen Klopp. Legend of the premier league, legend of Liverpool. Build this man a statue.  Y.N.W.A Klopp ❤️
To say I'm shocked is an understatement thank you Jurgen for the memories you will always be loved by all liverpool supports till the end of time hopefully the lads can send u off with a bang YNWA
Wow This Is Crazy !!!
We need statue for this great man. YNWA
It’s such a shock news. I thought that at least he will be a manager for another season but whatever he has already made a decision and we all respect his decision. He will always be missed and he will be a legend for being such a great manager to bring us the premier league champions for the first time in 30 years. Omg my tears is running down on my face whilst typing this comment 😢😢😢
Very sad but when the body and mind tell you you need a break it’s time to take a break …. This man is one of life’s true gentleman 🫶🏻
As a Chelsea fan, it's strange because one of the best coaches is leaving our EPL 😢
Pep will win all trophies now
We will always love you Klopp! Thankyou for everything.
❤
Anyone who has any part in liverpool will forever love Klopp YNWA❤❤❤
The day I've dreaded ever since he joined.  Thank you Mr. Jurgen Klopp. With a heavy heart, YNWA
Thank you for everything you did for Liverpool.. we love you Klopp.  To the people from the comments section  guys i smell Barcelona in the air.
Has var and the state of the Premier league had a effect on this.. I bet it has
Liverpool fc was dead when he became manager and he has changed everything
What kind of news is that.... 😢
I've never been so heartbroken, best of luck Klopp ❤️
Klopp for Germany 🇩🇪 Euro 2024
Build this great human a statue!  Absolutely one of the best trainers in the world. Thank you Jürgen! ❤
Absolutely devastated to hear this news But Thank you Mr Klopp for Everything you've done n brought to this wonderful amazing football club, You'll always be remembered. You made us from Doubters to Believers ❤ YNWA. More Respect.
Once a Liverpool , always a Liverpool...all the best Klopp...
Pep Linders should be next Manager
What a legend! Can't wait to see what follows for him. Wherever he goes, I hope he is very happy and wish all the best to Liverpool too.  I am not a Liverpool fan, but felt like one since Klopp's arrival and have been wishing for them to get the title every year since.
It was good to witness you in charge sir. Looking forward to the time when you come back to coaching after this season.
I won’t miss a single game moving forward. Will enjoy every bit as long as it lasts. Honoured to be a part of this history. Thank you for what you’ve done for us and the league Jurgen.
Thank you Jurgen for everything  ❤😢
Jürgen -- thanks for everything. We're devastated to hear you're going, but wish you the very best for the future. You and the Liverpool FC team have given us some incredible moments over the past nine years. I got to visit Anfield for the first time two years ago with one of my sons -- with the promise to bring my other three boys soon. Your 'stamp' on the club was everywhere -- the highest of standards, the family atmosphere, and the friendliest of staff. Congratulations for all you've done -- and enjoy your time with Ulla and your family. You'll always have a very dear place in the hearts of all Liverpool fans.
It's the owners there to tight
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Not a liverpool fan but klopp is a great manager one of the best we’ll defiantly in the top 1 😂 but there’s not a manager to replace him…..NO ONE!
We need his statue
Sad day for lfc!love you Jurgen no matter where you're❤🔴🥺
😢
You will never walk alone
Respect
OMG
YNWA, Jurgen ❤️🥺
this is worse than my breakup
Danke Jurgen. You made me cry today but I will always love you like I love my FATHER.
I am devastated at this news!
Thank you, Mr. Klopp... You're the best thing that happened to Liverpool in this Premier League era... I wish you the best in your future endeavor... Love you always, sir..
Respect my boss ,thanks for everythings 🎉❤
Amazingly open and honest. I hope he finds what he wants.
This is the day i knew was coming, but it still is a big shock. Jurgen changed this team, he changed my love for the club massively. Give the man a statue, name a side of the stadium after him. He will never be forgotten. YNWA! ❤🔴
Jurgen Klopp will always be a legend of this club. We were blessed to have him and devastated to lose him.
What a wonderful man and manager he has transformed the football club and made us believe again, this man most definitely needs a statue built after him the passion he has shown and the love he has for the city of liverpool is second to none and i include the people of this great city Danke jurgen.
So sad to see you go. Going to miss you Klopp! 😢
Liverpool downfall ⏳
Komm nach Hause Kloppo ❤❤❤Einmal Mainzer immer Mainzer ❤❤❤❤❤
End of an era 🥹🙌
Im thinking he want to coach  the German team
Klopp brother. I am sure you found your ring on the pitch. Did you lose it again? Damn Brother!
Legend
The more and more I watch this more & more I cry 😭❤
Come to Barcelona pls
As a Man City fan im shocked and wish him all the best! He have made the League so much better! God Bless.
So devastated by this news, literally in such bad feelings, thanks for changing our status to real believers and believing everything is possible for us,  succeeded to change and implement a solid squad that thrives for success, thanks for this superior Liverpool side Kloppo, we will always love you ❤
You made them into a winning team thanks for all the joyful memories down to u mate
With the way the team has been rejuvenated, I didn’t this coming. I’m still in shock and it’s a really tough one to take. I can only hope by the end of the season he changes his mind and stays. 😢
hope he wins the title this season 😢
That was such a tough watch.  I knew we were on countdown for him to leave but thought we had another 2 seasons.  Truly devastated but understand the reasons.  Thank you for everything, Jurgen.  YNWA ❤❤❤❤❤❤  Now let's get this quadruple fucking done!!!  Allez allez allez...
This day had to come and Jurgen did it as the big man he is. I wish him all the love and health for his future. Can never thank you enough for what you did to this club. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I respect your decision ..but accepting as a Liverpool fan with a heavy heart...we need to win for this man this season
Jurgen you have done a sterling job sir and I am delighted for you. Bitterly sad to be losing you but you have broken the hoodoo of the league title and that alone is enough for me.   I would like Pep Ljinders to take the role as manager. I appreciate he doesn't have managerial experience but I suspect he has been groomed for this role. He was about to leave a couple of years ago but had been given assurances about bigger role in coaching the team and is the head coach. He knows the players, inside out knows our style inside out and deserves a shot as I believe continuity to what we have built this season is essential. I do not want to go in a completely new direction yet. If it ain't broke let's not try to fix it by going for a Xabi-Alonso for example. Pep left Barca, Tito Villanova continued the winning streak thereafter before he became ill. Let's stay positive - what Klopp leaves behind is a superb infrastructure. Dortmund have continued to thrive long after Klopp's departure
thank you for the amazing 8 years.....  Any chance you change your mind and stay?🥲
He made us proud and happy. Let's finish this story in the best possible way together! Miss you already Gaffer. Build him a statue in front of Anfield, that is the least he deserves for his loyalty and the love he gave to this club. YNWA Jurgen Klopp ❤
Absolutely can't believe it .
As a  Manchester United fan I am very,very sad,Shell shocked😢😢😢😢
thank you very much sir for your service to our LFC feeling sad from Jamaica 🇯🇲 YNWA
What a great person, what a great interview. YNWA❤
Who Do You Bring In😮😮
This all about the club owner nothing else .kloop never get the enough support he deserves from the club owner
😣😥
You'll be missed. You came to Anfield as The Normal One and will leave as the Elite One!
What a legend.  The impact he has made on this club is absolutely outrageously great. This man has changed this club.  God bless jurgen
Danke Klopp😢😢😢😢😢
Pain
Thanks for all the special memories Jurgen.YNWA❤️❤️
Energy ? Give him a Powerade or Redbull!
❤️ynwa
We still need you boss don't go now please 😢😢
私の世界最高監督はユルゲン・クロップしかいない。これからも。 愛してるじゃ足りないくらい愛してる。 ありがとう。 残りを全力で応援します！YNWA
Goat
No chance of us not making Sunday about you jurgen. 💔
Klopp 😭 best coach ever I see in Liverpool 😢😢
Thank you jurgen and good luck ynwa
its so joeover
Klopp the legend, will this timing stop a certain person in Germany from going to Spain?
I'm devastated and shocked. It was inevitable one day....but not so soon! JK has given everything to LRC. He deserves to leave on his own terms.
I never cheered for any manager until Klopp came around in Mainz and later in Dortmund. Then he left Germany but I followed his road with Liverpool. That was a blast, he formed a great team, won it all and I thought he'd do it again. But I understand that the battery somewhen is empty and he needs to recharge. But still for now it is heartbreaking. All the best Jürgen! Much love from Germany.
Thank you Klopp
You have been the best Manager ever 😢  We will miss you terribly but 100% understand your decision.  Good luck Jurgen.  Enjoy the rest ❤ xx
Boss....noooooooooo🥺🥺🥺🥺💔💔💔
Noooooooo jurgen nooooo
Nooooooooooooooo 😭😭😭😭
💔💔💔💔
I'm so sad to hear Jurgen Klopp is leaving LFC just want to thank you Jurgen you definitely turned me into a believer if anyone deserves a break it's you to the player's let's send the boss of in style at the end of this season YNWA JFT97
He really transformed this club😢 You'll never walk alone klopp❤
A bit question is, what does he do after? To Bayern or Madrid? The Germany job? Or a year or two's rest? Will give an indicator as to the factor's behind this bizarre decision. I saw this burn out coming 4 or 5 yrs ago.
Got to say. I always liked Klopp. He’s done a great job for you and will be missed by me and a lot of none Liverpool fans. Go smash the rest of the season and good luck in the future. Ps I’m a west ham fan so please don’t beat us at the London stadium lol
❤
The more and more I watch this video more and more I cry 😭😭😭    Oh god herat break 💔 absolutely scattered   Love you boss you are inspiring
I'm speechless....wish him the best!
Xabi Alonso incoming...
😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
Brentford supporter..An honest, rare gentleman in this modern world. Will never forget Barcelona 4 nil..that showed he has the heart of Liverpool and what the club is. He has a life too..let him enjoy it. Good luck Jürgen
Thank you Kloppo. I think all the time that this day will come in someday. Time flies, people come and go but LFC will stay forever. Goodluck our best boss ❤. New era will begin next season 💪
I'm an Arsenal supporter and I feel sorry for Liverpool fans... and that has just reminded me that we will also reach that point with Mikel Arteta. Klopp is a very good coach, it is hard not to like him.
Like for a TREBLE win for the top of the best club in the world and to top an amazing managerial reign.  Let's go Liverpool YNWA ❤❤❤❤  We love you KLOOP
The ride with klopp is the best ever football experience, nothing but best wish for him to which ever national or club , thank you Klopp!
I’m so sad to hear this what a manager and he done for this club
There is no manager out there that can replace Klopp! So now what??!!!
When Ten Hag talked about eras coming to an end , i wasnt expecting this 😢..Jurgen will always remain the special one for the club ❤❤
i wish klopp nothing but good things in the future, nothing but respect. i just hope this doesnt impact the morale of the club
no no noooo noooo   i can't no please no i beg you nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
James Milner is the next coach
As a liverpool fan im heartbroken but i wish him all the best in his new endeavor 😢
Absolute Legend. What an amazing gift he gave us while in charge, transformed the club and made us dream again, he will be truly missed ❤
Xabi Alonso next
😢Gaffer don't go😢. We appreciate you ❤🇿🇼
Burn out is a real thing, no matter your place of employment.
In a world dripping with dishonesty it is refreshing to hear him speak with so much heart, honesty and frankness. He has been like a Dad for us all. Nothing but love for him. ❤
Legendary manager jurgen klopp will be missed always.
💔❤❤❤❤Amazing Manager , thank you , SIR KLOPP, best liverpool Manager ever !!!!!
Win it for Jurgen
As a fan, we appreciate everything Klopp has done in Liverpool. Just Klopp know, You'll Never Walk Alone ❤.   Love from Malaysia .
Even as a man united fan I always liked klopp and wish him the best
Oh my God. I never cry this hard before. 😢😭 Thank you, Klopp. YNWA. ❤
I still remember Klopp's reply in one of his early interviews when asked about signing high profile players.  His response was he wanted to sign players that wanted to play for the club and make it better.  I think he has surely done that.  His "monster mentality" will be surely missed.
Doubters to Believers he said, and then he led the way.  Thank You Jurgen ❣
hehehe this is great news.
thanks JURGEN!! brought us a lot of good memories and turned hope lasting 30 years into success!! DEADLY JOB
He sounds burned out and needs a break
😢😢😢😭😭😭😪
This hurts more than a break up
I will treasure every game of this season now.
There are a couple of reasons why the timing makes sense:  From Liverpool's point of view. This might be the perfect timing for getting Xabi Alonso in as a replacement as Ancelotte extented his stay at Real. From Klopps point of view, he might wait out for the German National Team. A job, that is less stressfull than maneging club football.  They announced it today, because the emotion could give the fans and players an extra boost for the rest of the season
Klopp will always be one of a kind but xabi Alonso in only makes sense and klopp for Germany international!!
THANK YOU FOR ALL WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!💌
Nooooo. No!!! NOOO!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As supporter of a dutch club ..i can only say :what a great human being you are.  Not especially a Liverpool fan but always great to see him in action and the respect he has for other people and clubs.
Never would've thought he'd leave out of nowhere.. but legend of the club, the city of Liverpool & Anfield itself has to give the man the best farewell in football history.
that's just destroyed the season.  should have just given him a year off.
And here i thought this year would be the rebuild season, and next year were gonna go all out for a treble at least before he leaves. Boy i was wrong. Thank you legend.
I’m in shock
The moment that I scared have finally come😭
Pep bullied him out lol
Totally gutted but accept one hundred percent Jurgen Klopp's reason. I thank him for his total honesty in coming to his decision. Bless you for instilling in LFC a belief they are and can be winners, owing to your love and passion for this great club  Whatever Jurgen does in the future I hope he'll know that YNWA!
自分がここまでサッカーを好きになれたのは、クロップとリヴァプールのおかげ。この数年間ほんとに見てて楽しかった。お疲れ様でした、ありがとうJürgen Klopp
I'm going to quit watching football.
Hope Lijnders take over next. If not, de Zerbi. Not Gerrard and certainly not Brendan Rodgers
Fucking heartbroken
I thought I could accept his leave in the past But now, I just cried for whole hour😢
Respect! Thank You Kloppo! I will support you to the end!  Your legacy and teachings are Greatly Appreciated!  Wishing you the Best for the Future! YNWA
league will be poorer for his absence ...
man im so gutted YNWA jurgen klopp
😢😢😢😞😞💔💔💔😭hhhhhh
Bring Zidane or Alonso please liverpool
Respect, he will be missed.
It's impossible to put into words the sheer grief I feel hearing this news.  It's just as hard to thank you enough for all you have done, all that you are & all you represent.  You are a fabulous inspiration to us all.  I am proud of how well you have represented our team and our city.  Jürgen you have been our North Star.  Your light will shine in this place for generations.  Enjoy the rest of the season & I wish you a well earned rest, recovery & energy as you move into the next phase of your life.  YNWA
Won few trophies
17:09 i love this man, boss tha!
Hats off for the "The Normal One"😢  Wish you luck for the next step, Klopp
The Greatest Liverpool manager ever  YNWA Boss 😢❤️
I dont know man. I just woke up 6 24 am and this is the news i see 😢😢😢. I will miss Jurgen just like all the other liverpool fans. I wanna cry but i wanna be happy that we had him as our coach. We love you Jurgen Klopp❤❤❤
This hurts YNWA❤
Now my day is spoilt worse news Eva
Thank you for helping me fall in love with football. We will support you no matter where you are from here on out. YNWA ❤️
As a fan it is my humble request to stay for another season at least, you deserve to win the treble. Just do that. Please sir. For one more season.
Please jurkenn  Do not leave
However sad it is... It has to be Xabi. Liverpool loves him and Bayer is first in the league.
I'm speechless 😢 Thank you for everything you have done for us   The Klopp 😉 The legend 😎  YNWA ❤
I’m crying
All good things come to an end. I'm shocked and sad, but also happy for him. We all need to take time and live our lives. He wants to enjoy his life without the daily pressure, I don't blame him. We all get burnt out if we are not too careful. Thank you Klopp for everything and wishing you the very best for the future. YNWA! A true legend.
Saying that he will never manage another club in England makes me cry
We love you Jurgen, YNWA❤❤❤❤❤❤
Gutted
I can know understand how people felt in 1974, when Shankly announced his retirement :( .
Why???? 😮
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
its not the first April. please😭
Kloop is such a legendary coach such that he turned , Pep (man city) into a better coach and other coaches better!
I am absolutely gutted but so grateful to Jurgen for everything he has done for the club, the City and the fans.  So privileged to have had you as our Manager and leader.  Legend forever.
Really so sorry that he is leaving , but forever grateful for the service he gave to the club. YNWA💖
I'm gutted I've been dredging this for yrs
You are the best of the best , Respectful ❤❤❤❤
What makes him special is that he trains Liverpool as a sincere human being.  Nothing is instant, he built Liverpool with a process.  We all know the process is not easy but he managed to become an outstanding coach who we all love.  But again, this sincerity comes from a human being, there is energy within him that has run out even though we all don't want to lose it.    Thank you Klopp, all the best for you. Youre always liverpool.
Such a sad day. Grieving! Yet nothing but love for Klopp. He bought back the winning DNA to our club. As they say, change is the only constant. You'll Never Walk Alone
Thank you Jurgen! We will all remember you!
The number of times I've checked the calendar to see if this is April 1st....😢
😭😭😭😭😭
รักเสมอครับบอส ไปพักผ่อนมั้งครับ ขอบคุณสำหรับทุกอย่าง🫡❤️
This man definitely deserves a statue outside Anfield at the end of the season, he has made us dream and believe again in our club. You'll always be welcome back boss YNWA
I am absolutely shocked
Sad sad news we thank you klopp will be missed
Come back klopp soon 🙏🏽
Thank you Herr Klopp for the joy and memories. Forever a @LFC legend. Thank you for making us believe again....🥲💔🙏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What a man😭❤️ Will miss him like crazy but happy that he chooses himself
Absolutely gutted but I’ll wish him the very best in whatever he does next, brilliant manager, lovely man.
Thanks boss man... for the journey... You know ever press conference you are you going to be asked about this until the last game . The last game you take as the red men as manager... Thanks again boss man
If you are lucky to be at a game before he leaves, sing his song loud 🎉.  Big salute Jürgen 🌟
Visca Barça y Visca Catalunya! Vine a Catalunya Klopp.
A quadruple sendoff
I want to cry but I’m at work right now, this is overwhelming
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
😢😢
Knew this day would come didn't think it would be this soon 💔 what a man to turn this club around
But what about our thousand year lfc reich jurgen 😭😭😭😭
Last time I was this sad over a Liverpool announcement was when Dalglish announced he was leaving in the 90's but somehow this feels worse. I have never been happier with any manager than with Jurgen Klopp. It wasn't just that he is an amazing manager, it's the fact that he's also an amazing person with so much compassion and charisma that even fans of our biggest rivals can't really hate him like they want to. Don't be sad it's over, be happy that it happened. You'll Never Walk Alone Jurgen ❤❤
Just when I think we are back on track to something great 💔💔💔 Thank you Klopp!
He looks drained and looks like he needs a break from the game, fantastic manager and that's coming from a Manchester united fan, i wish him well, you never know there could be a second coming in the future.
A Aussie supporter for 44 years. Absolutely brilliant this man. Understood, and became part of, the fabric of the club. Let’s go for Alonso.
Ada apa coach jujurlah 😢
We’ve got to name that new stand “The Klopp”… directly opposite “The Kop”. 👌🏼👌🏼
i'm lfc fans since 1982, this is one of the most devastating news for me, but i never running out of energy to support lfc.. please stay at least one more year ..juergen
Thanks For everything Jurgen YNWA Good Luck in whatever you do in the future
ผมคิดไม่ออกตอนที่คุณไม่อยู่กับพวกเรา😢😢😢ได้โปรดอย่าทิ้งพวกเราไปเลยได้ไหมได้โปรด พระเจ้าช่วยเปลี่ยนใจให้เขาอยู่กับเราไปอีก10ปีได้ไหมได้โปรด
THANK YOU BOSS 😢😢😢
The reason why I started supporting liverpool.YNWA Jurgen😊
Love the man, appreciate all he's done. Super Klop fan, but I actually also wanted him to leave. No love lost💪🏾♥️ Great coach
Klopp😢 ❤
I remember 2015 when he first came with that squad he inherited and he cracked on nd got on with our English values and the game will be missed soo much but good luck for the future klopp
We love you Jurgen. Let's make this last season one to remember. ❤
Message to the owners of this youtube chanel . You've got far to many adds in your videos , people just give up watching them when the videos are constantly  interrupted by adverts .
Don’t know what to do.  Totally and completely gutted.
Truly heart broken! This man is a legend and will always remain a legend, for everything has done in the past and this season. Truly a special manager!  Thank you Jürgen Klopp for everything! YNWA! ❤

Liverpool are finished now 😅
Klopp famous quote "Not so important when you come in, but its more important when you leave"
Understood. ❤ ❤❤ Legend.
TQ BOSS🫡🫡 🫡YOU GIVE EVERYTHING TO THIS CLUB ❤️❤️❤️ YOU ARE A LIVERPOOL LEGEND 🙌🙌🙌
Feel like i just got punched in the guts. Knew this day would come but bloody hell i'm totally gutted.
Thank you Boss.
Klopp is part of my memories about LIVERPOOL.. i love the club for so many years (even though I'm from far away part of the world) in the past its become a habit seeing the club loses amd many missed opportunities. But that's changed ever since Klopp came.. From the day 1 knew he was special (even though he denied it😂) thank you Klopp for given me a lot of memories with my beloved club. I know this day would come. But never thought would be so soon. YNWA BEST MANAGER EVER❤
This man is Liverpool 💔 YNWA  Thankyou Jurgen
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
It’s hard to compete against City’s budget and PGMOL, very draining I can imagine.  Thank you very much for what you have done for the club and the fans.  A very sad day when you leave.😢
football God himself
Thanks Jurgen. A legend and a proud member of the LFC family. Name a stand after him and build him a statue. If anyone deserves it, he does. YNWA
I know it silly to think you gonna be with us forever but thats how i felt but deepdown i always know this will happen but not now anyway goodluck boss you are the best liverpool manager in my lifetime YNWA!! Lets make this season special!!

Damn😢! You are our legend Klopp and you'll always be ❤.
We all know that day will come..nothing last forever..as a Chelsea fan am waiting for pep to go as well..now it’s time for other managers to make their name..Is just how football works..
We love you Jurgen go and live your life! Thank you for the wonderful memories!
Klopp will always be Liverpool and we all adore him but this really hurts and im in shock. I get the message he is sending I don't think we will see him manage again. Think he wants to retire.
We accept your decision and our support for the club remains. Let’s win the quadruple and give Klopp the send off he deserves 🔴❤️🔴
Wow I don’t know what to say!!!!
Made us so proud to say we support Liverpool. ❤
U will b missed ..legend♥️
Thank you, we understand
I know the feeling of being completely burned out and spent. Wishing you all the best Jurgen and may you find love and success always. Thank you for making us believe again and Liverpool will always stand by you. True King of the Kop.
He is the best manager liverpool had.. Klopp is a scouser and needs a big ovation for him. Moving forward hope Xabi Alonso will be our next manager
Ynwa mr klopp
He saved us and rebuilt us. We’re forever in debt to you boss.  Thanks for everything, I mean it.
Noooooooo... nooooooo... noo please don't go... don't gooooo
🥺🥺
Hate to see him GO.. But there's life outside of football. Top top man. YNWA!!!
🥹🥹🥲
Heartbroken but respect every word he had to say no one will replace you boss YNWA❤
I'm sorry
Pep linders for manager ?
Please tell him to speek to xabi alonso  to join liverpool 😢😢😢😢
From doubters to believers, thanks Jurgen ❤
Manajemen Liverpool harus bikin patung Juergen Klopp di empat penjuru mata angin di depan stadion Anfield dan itu harga mati.
YNWA  you'll never be forgotten ♥️
Jurgen Klopp, pure class. No other words. Thank you for everything
YNWA
Heartbroken but thankful. YNWA
I am genuinely heartbroken 💔
Lieber Herr Klopp, dank Ihnen bin ich Liverpool Fan geworden! Sie hören auf ihr Bauchgefühl, absolut richtig. Hoping all the best for the Reds in the ongoing season🎉, and 4u personally!
I love you Jurgen, we owe you more than we can repay
A legend 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏YNWA
Why announce it in the middle of the season?
I am soooo sadddd❤❤❤ Irreplaceable Klopp
YNWA ❤ You’re forever the best coach / manager we ever had since I supported Liverpool, you will be missed, and we will support you in the future no matter where and what decision you made!
stab in my heart this
Great manager!! Good luck to him.
He won Liverpool's only premier league title  Give him his flowers
I am a city fan but I love this guy so much I love you Klopp
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is all FSG's fault and we know it.
Thank you! Our Legend 🙏🏻💔
No this can’t be true. This will destroy Liverpool that’s for sure. I wish it’s not true
We love you Jurgen! Thank you for making Liverpool champions again, what a ride, what memories! Go and have a really amazing holiday! YNWA! ❤💯🙏
It’s sad to hear about this news but with respect to this decision , it’s something we as the supporters to accept with open heart😢
Tank you Klopp ❤🇩🇪  You never walk alone
😢😢😢😢
Thanku Jurgen Klopp for the great memories u gave me as a supporter of Liverpool FC .
Nothing lasts forever. All the best, Jurgen! One of the greatest PL managers!.
i’m a city fan but im moved by the announcement… i love this man, his professionalism and coaching skills. a huge loss to liverpool and epl as a whole. but Best of luck klopp✨✨✨👌🏽
Man utd need him more..so he accepted it
Build the statue !!!! Now
Decent manager. Couldn't find the consistency of Sir Alex the man he tried to emulate
You're my hero, Klopp! You've inspired me to chase my own coaching dream in football - your energy, relationship and mentality.  I totally respect your decision and understand 100% why you feel like you do.    Imagine what thousands of people can do, when one man can do what you've done.   YNWA - from the Black Forrest to Liverpool - what a story!
Herr Klopp, lieber Jürgen.. Danke für alles was du für unser Liverpool FC gemacht hast, du hast aus unseren Club einen neuen Liverpool FC gemacht... it was I think for all Liverpool fans a big Fairy Tail Chapter in our life because of you... thank you a lot.. your a Liverpool Legend 🙏🏻 Jürgen Klopp, YOULL NEVER WALK ALONE ❤️🤍
What sad sad news, but we know that you wouldn't have come to this unless this was absolutely necessary. We love you Jurgen and God bless you for what you have done for us YNWA ❤
He's going to Bayern
Omg,. 😢
Am sad guys am sad  and am really having a bad day at work😭😭😭😭
No Matter What You Are LEGEND !!
Absolutely sad news. YNWA ❤
This broke my heart
Couldn't hold back the tears after the news sank in and I haven't teared in over 5 years. Thank you Mr. Klopp for delivering on your promises and more, restoring our pride in our team and gracing us with your unique character.
What a beautiful human being, he brought me so much joy 😢
Living legend
My favourite manager, and I am a West Ham fan. Big loss for the PL.
Hope he U-turn. I've never seen so many youth players before. Olive Beck, Kaide Gordon, Conor Bradley, Jarrell Quansah, Harvey Eliot, Curtis Jones, Kelleher. Even the bought-in stars are young. His replacement must groom these youths.
devastated but then again very grateful for his dedication. He has given us the Premiere League title after 30 years of wait,  Not to mentioned the UEFA Champions, Super Cup champions, World Club champion. Let's go out with a bang hopefully with a quadruple at the end of the season.  YNWA from Singapore
Oh man!  Liverpool's history is quite sad.  Even in success there's little sad things like winning the league after a long wait but under a lockdown pandemic. The Gerrard slip. Getting a superstar coach only for Pep to enter the league and make it that much harder and stressful for him.   But they're a strong club with resilient fans.   Still though another sad chapter in the long history of Liverpool.
Just wanna a say thanks boss for everything
You’ve just made a fully grown man cry, all down here from here klopp goes salah goes team morality drops owners sell up we in for a rocky ride my pool fans let’s just enjoy the season now forever YNWA❤️❤️❤️
Womp womp
Broken heart 💔 😢
I’m literally bawling.
Klopp has won six trophies with the club, including the Premier League title in 2020 and the Champions League trophy the year before.
Its not surprising, i mean the guy has bled for liverpool for so many years, fighting against an amazing but criminally underpinned team owned by a country, (man city),  and in any other time would have won  at least 4 more league titles. I have always warmed to him, a great coach, a fantastic leader, and above all else a wonderful man.  Im sad and Im an Ipswich Town fan.  However it comes to an end eventually and you have to deal with it and push on.
That day has sadly come... 💔
😔🥺😢😭💔
My highlights of the era: Trent's corner against Barca, Klopp's pitch invasions and....Bobby's teeth. Sad times.
Lets win the quadruple
I'm prepared for this day. Nothing is forever. I understand your situation, I know this is extremely hard decision to make. Fully respect that. I want to see you and Ulla happy. There is no goodbye. Nope never. You have taught Liverpool the value of believe, instilled the monster mentality with the boys. Oh and the beautiful football wow. And that's the best gift you've given us. Oh, I will be support your new club. Cheers!
Very very sad😢
I'm Swiss guy, I started following Liverpool when Shaquiri signed in Liverpool and I discovered Jurgen Klopp. I found this manager in his behavior with players unique. Impressed by all this energy and the passion he shows on the edge of the field. He has become for me an example of a man as an energy. I am not sad but happy to see that his personal life is much more important than everything else, we have only one life. Everything is impermanence, it's life. You will never walk alone as some people have already written. Long live and thank you Mister.
He probably wants the Real Madrid job. He also took a year break after Dortmund too, he knew bigger clubs were lurking. Taking a years break and feigning fatigue looks better than immediately swaping clubs. He prob tried to get himself sacked for most of last season.
Please build 4 statues for Mr Jurgen Klopp for what he has done at this club
Just wait for the next Liverpool's match at home. People won't let this marvelous man go that easily. Very emotional times incoming.
Build Jurgen a statue....he is a great man! I love Jurgen
I'm a City fan but he is undeniably amazing. Without Klopps Liverpoo,l City would've fully dominated all of English football. He is arguably the closest manager to Pep and he is undeniably a top 10 manager of all time.
Klopp you will never walk alone now get a statue built and let's win the quadruple for this man ❤
Bro its like the first time I've realise that it is almost 10yrs Klopp is in Liverpool. He is a legend we need a statue for him. He is the best manager we ever had for me
only ONE EPL title in 30 years
The last dance
Thanks for every moment you had with us. See u in the sea under the sun
Finally he saw the light, now come manage man utd now Jürgen x
Struggling to hold the tears back already and you not even gone yet... Thank you for all you have done thus far and let's take the rest off the season by the horns! IN KLOPP WE TRUST!!
Exceptional human being! As he explains it, it is the right decision. To be honest. If he says it is...then it is.
Why jurgen? 😢
A dark dark day - Thanks for everything Boss!
Happy retirement, juergen. Enjoy! Thank you so much
Our gaffer now and always YNWA
💔No way
Дядя Юра, родной ты наш человек. Хорошего тебе отдыха!
Don't leave us jurgen
Go live your life, man! You've done your job. Thanks!
The news is sooo a tragedy to us all lfc supporters 😢 anyway down the years you have transformed we as a club ❤ to a masterpiece club   Thank you my manager our manager liverpool manager ❤  All the best where ever you goo 😢❤🎉
Is he sick or something, this is soooo wrongggg
Devastated.  Thank you Juergen ❤
Devastated. Genuinely, never felt so connected to a manager. Love you always Jurgen. What a way to potentially give him a send off. Let’s go boyssssss!
I predict his next managerial job will be at Barcelona.
🐐
Thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you’ve done all these years for the club. YNWA❤
Could not be more proud over this man. this man made our club competetive again and we will always be thankfull. thanks
Spoken with the dignity and foresight that we have come to expect of you in your work as a soccer manager. I wish you the health and good fortune that you have so clearly earned, to enjoy your private life on your own terms. Thank you, sir.
Huge respect for the manager, been great for Liverpool.
Even as an arsenal fan I am in tears man. 😢 I have no words to describe. The personality that he has i want in my club. Whatever happens he is the legend of Liverpool and one the legend managers after fergie wenger.
There is no way this is real 😢
What a true gentleman, inspirational footballer and manager, total respect for him and massive admiration. That took so much courage and you will be hugely missed by the footballing world.  I'm a Norwich fan, really looking forward to Sunday. (!),
😢😢
Absolutely gutted!
As a united fan, this is my favourite manager of all time, behind Ferguson of course.
Nooooo😢😢😢😢
The club won't be the same without him
He is like a god father to all of us as a fans..we will missssss him alotttt..but we have to respect his dicision..so what next to liverpool??who can replace his part..for me..zidane..😢😅
Pure class
😭😭😭😭 we will always be here for u klopo ❤️❤️
Come Home Coach...
Thank you, Jurgen. You will remain in our heart as one of the best coaches in the history of this club. You'll never walk alone
Klopp is indeed irreplaceable, however, right now I don't see anyone except Xabi Alonso taking the role and not harm the club.
Joe Gomez to score the tittle deciding goal
Thank you for everything Mr Klop...🙏😢♥
This shock was the only way. We would never have been able to prepare for this moment 😢. Jurgen Klopp, it's the toughest thing to accept after what you have done for this club, the city, the game and the fans. You're etched in history... in your words, "from here we go" YNWA
There are no words. With all due respect, I have never seen such an incredible personality in my life. He is a real blessing for the club and although the news probably shocked everyone, we can only do one thing: we respect, understand and support. And make his final months in Liverpool unforgettable.

Im in shock
Noooooooooooooooooooo! :(
Can’t imagine a classier statement. What a man
Painfull
As a Chelsea this guy made Liverpool great again surely will be a big miss.
If any rich people see this. I’d love to go to a game before Klopp leaves with my gf. I need tickets🫶
Whoever is reading this in 2054, this was the best  coach to ever lived
Love you Klopp. Thank you for your unwavering commitment to our club. I will never forget you.
great manager, wish him all the best. united fan btw
We gonna miss you a lott. Thanks for everything❤
Let’s win the title this season as a farewell gift befitting for a living legend. He deserves a statue at least at Anfield. I’m devastated..
Essentially, it's not you, it's me.
The memories this guy created from the day he walked in. Klopp you'll be missed and loved by every liverpool fan around the world.  You changed us from "DOUBTERS TO BELIEVERS"  LETS WIN EVERYTHING FOR HIM! YNWA❤
The things he gave for the club, will surely be remembered as one of the greatest ever for Liverpool. Mad respect for our Kloppo.
YNWA...Top Manager and a Top Man. God bless you and your family Sir and all the best with your future endeavors
Thank you for everything .❤ A statue of him for sure !
What a legend.. what a character, what a legacy, what a man. Thank you, Jurgen, for your service. YNWA 😢
Now  Liverpool will feel the same emptyness as Dortmund felt when he left us in 2015.
Genius and Charismatic Yurgen. We shall miss you but YNWA wherever you end to.
"Klopp for the Kop" THANKYOU The Normal One"
As an arsenal supporter I must say in my opinion this is the best manager of all time given what he achieved with the financial limitations he had...wouldn't mind arteta gives us similar news before the season ends...all the best king Klopp
he shaped dortmund to a formidable team, to outclass Bayern...for the bundesliga title, he showed his exceptional quality at Liverpool... I became a fan of his style of play after watching dortmund  magic... he has that energy instilled in him , shared amongst his players....Thank you Klopp for making football a high energetic pressing match...Hope he is heading to the National  German team
We love you Kloppo legend in this city ❤❤❤
This is why he is the man and the manager he is. He knows himself, and the people around him - he is both self awareness and compassionate. He realises that he doesn't want to fall out of love with the club, or have the fans do the same. He is leaving early so that he remains at the heart of the club forever. And in its bones. Brilliant man, understandable but hard decision for him. YNWA.
The Greatest Liverpool Manager of All Time. You will be missed and you always be a Red
Do us one last favor Mr Klopp and help bring Xavi Alonso
I am crying....
As a Chelsea fan, he was by far the best LFC manager out there and now he can win a treble with Carabao, EPL and Europa titles, a perfect farewell for a manager of his stature.
You are so amazing boss thank you for everything 🎉 I love your smile always keep up, you will never walk alone 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Damn!! Klopp is the reason I’m a Liverpool supporter, I’m sooo hurt 😞
Worlds gone dark 😢
Im speechless man,this guy made our club so great and the fact he is leaving at the end of the season i could never be sadder man :(
Very sad news to hear 😢
Cracking manager from an Arsenal fan, if we don’t win the league I hope Liverpool do now so he gets a good send off. The Prem will miss you Kloppy
I cant even imagine Liverpool without this man. Love this man great manager. We going to miss you Mr Klopp from a United Fan.
Liverpool LEGEND ❤
Just watched this video feels like my wife just asked me for a divorce it's not you it's me! Gutted just hope his last season is the best one yet
We Love You and we will never forget what you’ve done for us all these years. You’ll Never Walk Alone Jurgen!
I love this man no matter if he’s the manager or not he will always be a red thank you Jurgen for everything you’ve done for the club and it’s supporters❤ YNWA
It will be a weight off His shoulders now that He has made such a heartbreaking decision; heartbreaking for both Him and the Fans. It would be interesting to know  if He has a personal choice for His replacement. My own choice would be for Pep Lijnders to take up the reins, allowing for continuity and familiarity. Jurgen will leave a wonderful legacy which we will be forever grateful for.
Gutted
The most important figure at the club's recent history and a legend who will be remembered forever as one of THE Liverpool managers❤❤
Damn what a sad ending, Liverpool fans will realise that it is the end of an era after his departure 😢 Liverpool will never be the same
Nov Nov Nov
As an Arsenal fan my father is a diehard Liverpool supporter this man single-handedly revived Liverpool and revived the fans love and made it grow tenfold he is an absolute legend and a genius gonna miss his mad reactions when something goes wrong on the pitch premier league is gonna be different without seeing him on the sidelines
They have to win league for this man this year😢
A legend not just for the club. But for the sport.   YWNA
are the owners sacking him? whats going on?
I am not liking waking up to this this morning, but he is a legend. There aren't any words to do it justice. None.   He will never walk alone. ❤️
YNWA
As heartbreaking as this is klopp will never walk alone ❤️
Holy shitballs....
It's hard to accept that he will leave but I understand he wants a normal live especially after all he Has done for Us. It has been honour to have you with us for all these years. Thank you for everything! YNWA
My Gaffa. 🎶I’m so glad that Jurgen is a red🎶 Now time to finish what he started.❤❤ YNWA❤
Great news for the rest of the prem
❤️
Let’s go for it!
Feels like losing a loved one
From an Arsenal fan, I never expected it to be this soon, but on other end every journey has an ending and also it's an opportunity for the next generation of managers to come in. I would like to see Xabi Alonso come in. Thank you Jurgen u've given EPL eight years of gegenpressing football. Danke
build this man a statue already
😢😢😢😢😢
And so begins the downward spiral for the club. Will take a few years to recover from this.
Legend of the club Legend of the game  Farewell Jurgen
Huge love from South Korea. My hero, You will Never Walk Alone.
😢😢😢
I'm crying
You are the best coach today. Because you can change the mentality of a strong player. May you and your family at home always live a long and healthy life 👍
“Does anyone in this room think that I can do wonders? I’m a normal guy from the Black Forest. My mother is very proud. I am the normal one." - Jurgen Klopp 2015  You might have called yourself the normal one, but for us fans, you have been anything but normal. Klopp is Liverpool. We're the proud ones now!
Tough to take. Think last season really took a told on him. Absolute legend ❤ YNWA
Klopp will leave behind a legacy. Thank you for a fantastic 8 seasons, quality signings and memorable moments. Forever a Red citizen YNWA!!!!
😮 gutted
Always and forever Klopp ❤❤❤❤❤ YNWA ❤❤❤❤
😢 i will miss him... YNWA❤
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Didn’t backstab, complain, leave unexpectedly, or leave for more money. Built a powerhouse and ended a 30 year drought, the news is an absolute shock, but to say i’m upset? I could never be, what Jurgen Klopps done is phenomenal…the european nights, giving us exciting football and giving us the passion we lacked for years before him to turn us into believers again…thank you Klopp, you deserve a statue
Gutted but honored to have Klopp as my beloved club Manager. All the best good sir!
Klopp is Liverpool Liverpool is klopp ❤❤
Legend you make me cry, you r bigger than any trophy ur priceless, big fortunate to live ur legacy at this club with pain we went through before u join, thank u boss.
This decision really came as a shock, i would've never imagined it especially at this stage of the game and the form we are in. But Jurgen has a constructive mindset and i believe he took this decision for the betterment of the team. Thank you Jurgen...♥️
Like mane like salah.. klopp deserves to do exactly what he wants. I trust in klopp and am grateful for everything he has done. Let's enjoy the last few months of this legend. Because history never changes.  He had been huge for Liverpool. Complete respect even if its sad to see him leave.
ออกเมื่อทีมบินสูงดีแล้วครับ คุณคือตำนาน ขอรูปปั้นหน่อยยยย
No no no 😞😭 gutted he was my favourite manager ever we will be lost without him wish u all the best sir ❤️
"We are Liverpool"🫀❤‍🩹
YOUR GONE FLOP 😂😂😂😂😂 UNITED ARE BACK ENJOY 👹
God, im devastated
Klopp you’re liverpudlian forever in club history, take a break and enjoy different life with family, Thanks for everything and Good Luck
Danke Herr Klopp, thank you for everything.
don't be sad it ended, smile because it happened
Took us from rock bottom to win our 6th Champions League, our 1st Premier League title, an FA cup, a League cup, a Super cup, Community Shield and Champions of the fucking world. Had our lows but had countless highs, made club legends and hero’s we will never forget, made our identity and changed doubters into believers. Jürgen Norbert Klopp, we thank you 🔴❤️
Devastated,  thank you for the great years, Mr Klopp . You'll be greatly missed 😢
Obrigado por tudo ídolo, te amo 😔😔😔❤️🇧🇷
when he said  "because nobody will sack me", and "because I am not the right one for the future"  I felt that in my heart. He loves the club so much that he takes himself out of the equation because he wants what is best. Let's win everything and give him the parade to send him off
The club wouldn't be where it is now without Jurgen. So much love for the man. Very very sad to see him leave. But absolutely wish him the best, thankful for everything he has accomplished with  LFC. A true legend.
Absolutely without doubt one of our greatest managers. He is right up there with Shankly, Fagan, Daglish, Paisley and Rafa. I love his humility and his humour, always comes across as a great person. Thank you Jurgen for all you have done. Doubter to believer forever. YNWA ever, god bless you and all the very best for whatever you do in the future 👍
Look at all the memories we had with comeback versus Barcelona winning the Champions League winning the Premier League after 30 years of heartbreak question is who should be manager next season?
I never thought I could cry over such things... Thank you Jürgen! You meant a lot for people. Much more than you even think. Have a great vacation and thank you for everything. Much love ❤  And the most important thing: You'll Never Walk Alone!
Boss thank you ❤😢
Julian Nagelsmann must replace Jürgen Klopp
Yoh big news. Big character leaving the Premier League, top manager, for his players . I wonder whats next. As a non LFC fan we can only hope for the worse.😂
Akloppalypse now.... the horror.... the horror :(
In a nutshell, man needs a break from this type of life and is understandable. He was always "the normal one" now it's time for him to enjoy a normal life. Thank you Jürgen🥺
I respect Jürgen's decision, if he think this team is ready for new manager then I believe him.. Absolute love what he done to the club. Come on lads lets finish in high winning trophies for him. YNWA❤
Pure legend for the club. Got it back on rails and won every trophy possible with them, YNWA Jurgen 🫡❤️
When it's time to go it's time to go , like our Great Sir Alex Ferguson, Jurgen Klopp added to the lists of Great coach and manager, Salute to you Sir
😢
Sedih , tak ada angin tak ada hujan tiba2 berita gini 😢😢😢  YNWA ❤
Take a rest, Jurgen! And we'll see you in a few years again
Done a lot for the club...will be missed even by rivals
Start building the statue
I respect your decision Boss. you are honest and down to earth and that's why I respect this men, why I love this men and why I love this club (and because of Anfield) 🔴 You Never Walk Alone Jürgen 🔴
As a fan of Borussia Mönchengladbach it still kind of makes me so sad😰 Cant Imagine Liverpool and Football in general without him 🤍
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OH HELL NAW
0:15 my soul also leave from my body.
I am devastated 😭 wish you all the best Klopp. You'll be enshrined a legend. YNWA
no ..we are not ready for this
As long Pep Linders takes over we will be good. Good luck Jurgen YNWA
Thank you Klopp! YNWA❤
We will miss you  Sir Klopp. Thank you for everything you have given us
YNWA❤❤❤❤
YNWA  😪
Klopp Klopp Klopp Kloppoooooooo !!!! 💪🏽🔴
We love you Jurgen
Thank you for your energy.  I believe that he has to do what he has to put himself and his family first.
Legend of Liverpool ❤
Thank you for EVERYTHING you've done for this club. You'll never walk alone ❤
Thank you for your time here, Jurgen.. forever REDS .. YNWA! Now, the last mission is to convince Alonso to manage ..
Doubters to believers. Danke.
💔
It's an unbelievable time for coach Klopp to say he's leaving at the end of the season but in Liverpool's hearts you'll always be in Liverpool's hearts. ❤❤
He will always be a legend 😥❤️‍🩹🙏ily klopp 🙏🏾😥❤️‍🩹
This is so so sad :(
You have too live your life. I love and respect you. wish the hole crowd could say YES, YES, YES to you.....❤❤❤
As a young supporter who started watch at a bad time for the club Jurgen is the face of what Liverpool have now transformed into.
Barcelona
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR LIVERPOOL  YNWA BOSS ❤
This is a blow to the Prem league
♥️♥️♥️
Jurgen is the best thing to happen Liverpool since Paisley and Shankley. Steven Gerrard was Mr. Liverpool for his career but now it is Jurgen Klopp. The memories you gave me I will never forget. Thank you for bringing me so much joy. I will be eternally grateful. You’ll Never Walk Alone ❤
Ohh noo, please boss 😭😭💔
i heard this not clear on my mind
He wants to be Germany manager 😂
Pain
You have nothing to explain Jurgen, you have been a breath of fresh air. I just hope you have a long and happy life with your wife and well deserved rest. Its been a pleasure. Your will always be our Gaffer. We love you. Ynwa
The team needs to win him a Europa league title to complete his trophy cabinet. Virgil and co please do the needful.
What a Klopp out ....at least another 2 seasons please. Stop it , im not tearing up, you are ..😢😢
Nòooooooooo😢
As a Liverpool supporter, u are loved, u will be remembered a Shanklys second coming.
When Klopp came in Liverpool had handful of trophies,hadn’t competed in finals for years,had only 1-2 world class players,never thought of winning the league Prior to now when klopp is leaving he has made Liverpool and every single player in the whole setup world class player,have transformed the club In a way that they will always be one of the favourites to win the title gave us dozens of legends  Anyone can say anything about you jurgen but little do they know what you’ve done and achieved for us you will always be a legend in the country there will be a huge huge huge hole for the owners to fill but my freind from the bottom of every kopite you can take some rest now 🫡🥺
😢
He saw he came he conquered thanks for everything boss
24:31  We are liverpool 😢🤍
no... 😢
Heartbreaking. Thank you for everything Jurgen, you made us believe again 🙏🏼
No single word can describe him better than "Legend". Made us fans dream, made us believe, and made us celebrate the joyous occasions.  Truly appreciate his time at the club, and if there is a statue to be built, it must be of Jurgen Klopp.  YNWA
Now that’s professional, he’s burned out.take a year off and then whatever he does will be done well.Thanks Jurgen.come on you reds.lets win the league and give him a proper send off 👍
I beg. I have always admired you and always will. Absolutely stunning manager.
OH MY GOD, what a horrible day.......OH MY GOD! Thank you Sir for the wonderful memories.
Noooooo jurgen😢
What a lovely man and brilliant manager. Classy to the end. Gutted. (Xavi, next please)
What a coach for me even as a Manchester United fan I would’ve loved him at our club to compete with city despite not having anywhere near the amount of resources says it all about him he revived a sleeping giant what an absolute legend you have to respect what he’s done in the premier league
Klopp era is over. It's time for other club to rise,probably Aston villa under unai.  Klopp will be the legend that turn Liverpool into a strong contender 😁💪👍
I can only commend the good servant in jurgen!!!
Thanks for all the memories Jürgen you will forever be a legend in our hearts ❤️
What is a reason sir.......
Sad news. I think something was happening at the club, but he had too much respect to say the truth. I'm sure Salah will leave too.
please boss dont go !! we need you !! 😢
It has to be Linders, he knows the philosophy.
Struggling to work today
The kop made klopp and klopp made it is own..Liverpool forever..You will never walk alone.
Men shouldn't cry they say......🥺
Jurgen Klopp is a legend not only in Liverpool but in football. Sad day 😢
I have been a Liverpool fan for 32 years. Jürgen Klopp is the goat. Respect his decision. It's a bit sad, but all good things must come to an end. Love from Thailand.  T_T
😭❤️💯
"O Captain! My Captain!"
what a big loss for the whole football world, we all love and respect you kloppo. best of luck and health for the future. YNWA
We love you forever Jurgen !
You are always our legend
We will have klopp at united you can have ten hag 😂😂😂
Despite a rival fan, i must say he is on same level as Arsene is for Arsenal... i liked what klopp did at liverpool, the playing style, his connection with fans, signing, etc...liverpool legend...would love to see a statue outside anfield...one of the goat manager in the world
ฟ้าวไปไส
Chelsea fan, but Klopp made me grow a soft spot for Liverpool. Top top Manager 🫡
I am hopeful that Jurgen has set the benchmark for Liverpool managers going forward and this a young team being rebuilt, lets hope this is the start of a Liverpool Dynasty that 50/60 years time will be looked at in the same light of the 70/80’s dominance we had
Thank you Jurgen for what you have done for this club i have loved for 45 yrs.  Today youve made a grown man shed a tear 😢  You are an amazing human being and a true Liverpool Legend. Go well Boss. ❤❤
when is he leaving
Pep lindgers will be the new coach
I rate Klopp or Paisley as our greatest ever manager. Having built Liverpool 2.0, I thought he would want to be the manager when the team starts winning trophies and he would extend his contract. Given he has decided to go, the timing is good because FGS can now look at approaching Xabier Alonso. Wish Jurgen all the best for the future.
Let's send him off in the best way possible.
World class interview
NOOOOO. IM REALLY LOVE U KLOPP BUT SERIOUSLY I think u deserve a better team that will give u a suprise not like Ours Owner.
Good luck ❤️❤️
Take a 1-2 years break, live a normal life, get bored, come back.
Hal yang sangat menyedihkan buat Fans Liverpool, tetapi berita menggembirakan buat Fans MU.. 😢
Farewell 😢😢 legend
Welcome to man united Klopp 😜
😢😢😢
I will miss Jurgen  klopp seriuosly Eish we love you so much Liverpool fans❤❤❤❤
Very sad to see this , but everything has its time , i absolutely love this man and he is by far the best coach we had under my time as a supporter (since 2000) whatever he likes to do after this i wish him all the best , and i really hope we can win the premier league that would be a great thing for him to finish like that , what a great man to let us all and the club know this early so they can prepare for the aftermath of one of , is not the greatest manager in the history of this club  call Xabi Alonso right away , pick up the phone TODAY and see if he is interested, other than Xabi Alonso i dont wanna speculate in anyone else out of respect for big Jurgen. Best regards from a LFC fan from Sweden , lets finish this season in greatnes YNWA!
Ahhhh Man!!!, My Heart is Broken
Devastated. ❤🥺
Anyone bugged by that trouser leg! Arghhhh!!!
Thanks for all the memories Jurgen. You were instrumental in brinibg our club back to being one of  best footballing side in football.  What a pairing.  YNWA

Let's all laugh at Loserpool 😂 back to reality the United era starts now
Sad news to all Liverpool funs😢😢😢
I’m a normal guy not living a normal life. I want to try and see what a normal life is like before I’m too old
Absolutely heartbreaking news 😭 We will always love you Jurgen  Thank you for what brought to Liverpool football club YNWA❤
Xabi? Nagelsman?
Klopp did say two years ago he would leave in 2024 😮
This feels like my father leaving me. This is absolutely horrible. Jürgen Norbert Klopp is the father of all our players, the father of the staff and everything. This fucking hurts, it fucking hurts man. We couldn’t have wished for a better man. I and we love you, Jürgen Norbert Klopp❤️
Bring Xabi to Liverpool please
Extra motivation to win the league this season
😢
Thank you for everything you did for this club ❤
Legend.
This came out of No where.. but we wish you all the best jurgen❤️
You have brought me so much joy for the last 8 years, You will be missed not only as a manager of Liverpool but as a good man. Love ya always.
I am absolutely devastated. I love this person so much. Thanks for everything dear Jürgen ♥️🙌 YNWA! 😭😭😭
So heartbreaking News. But respect to Klopp with the reason "be a normal guy with normal life". I have imagined and expect grunge and hard rock style of football next season after building the foundation this season, but it's not happening. YNWA
He knows what he's doing, this is to gee the team up to win the league for him!
LEGEND! we had so much fun, You made Liverpool one of the greatest teams of all time, regular players to superstars and the team style with show, fire in the eyes..now its time to rest with a bottle of whisky:) all the respect BOSS! YNWA
Klopp stay with us we love you 😍 😢❤
damn bro😶
Jürgen thanks and take care
dont bro dont .. no way
YOU’LL NEVER EVER WALK ALONE!!  WE LOVE YOU JURGEN! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! LEGEND❤️
This sucks, but is totally understandable. Adore you, JK. All the best. Now let's win the lot! YNWA...
You will always be remembered klopp,  our team is so good now because of you.
NOO THE LEGEND NOWOBE IS BETTER THAN KLOPP WHO IS THERE NEW MANAGER
thank you old trafford
😭😭😭😭😭
I Love you Jurgen 🫶🏾❤️. Michael Aggrey-Ampiah (Kobby) here, a life long Liverpool fan from Ghana 🇬🇭.
I didn't think I could respect and support him more, but there you go, a world class manager and a rare human being! YNWA
He wants to be backed instead of playing catch up on a budget.
Heartbroken, but completely accept his decision, love the man, there'll never be another like him.   Go and live your best life Jurgen, recharge those batteries and hopefully we all see you back in the game at some point, lifting another lucky club to greatness.  One of the greats, on and off the field, in football and beyond, legend.    Anyway, bring on Norwich!
Barca fan.  Luis Enrique was the best there. He made the 2015 score goals we have never seen. Tiki Tata PLUS counter attack.  Klopp is the best in recent decade in England. Cause he arrived at a nobody team and made it the best in the world for a while.
😭😭😭 Thank you for everything my BOSS.❤
Thank you. You're a great man with great principles. Rare find. ❤
what a manager, he won every trophy possible. YNWA, build him a statue
Salah and klopp both going 😭😭
Jurgen, my legend, my icon, is gonna leave. I'm sad but I fully understand his points. We have time to seek a valid manager. I agree with him to informing the club in advance so that we'll be able to find a suitable replacement. Thanks great man, we'll never forget you. Y N W A. Reds X ever!!!
Nooo please
Not a Liverpool fan but when his wife told him "We're not gonna leave these people behind right?" a few years back before his extension I thought he would manage Liverpool for a long long time. Truly the end of an era, wish you good luck Mr Klopp.
Please say it's a joke, please, please, please. I'm not sure it is time for our Boss, our hero, one of the biggest Liverpool legends to leave from us.
Thank you for everything Jürgen!  I remember the day, when there was an announcement in the newspaper, that you`ll be the new manager of Liverpool FC and since then it was an special story with this special club, which isn`t over yet. All the ups and downs, all the titles but also difficulties - you managed them. Danke Jürgen!  You`ll Never Walk Alone.
This is sad sad news 😢
Thank You, Jürgen. YNWA ❤️
Think It may have transfer policy and budget factors with arsenal and United to spend big in the summer  I think he will end up mardrid next year
I hope the standards will be kept at the club but it will be difficult with someone else as this guy is one of a kind. Brought us so much success that will be hard to recreate. I would of told the club to do everything to keep him as he is integral to Liverpool now but he has the decision at the end of the day. Thanks for it all lets win as much as we can this season ❤️🇩🇪
Liverpool in the mud😂😂😂😂
😂 as a city fan i am very happy and excited.  🎉🎉🎉  He should go rytnow in fact 😂😂🎉🎉🎉😅
Devastated by this news. Just last night I was looking up ancelottis age and saying to myself Klopp has plenty more years to go. Wish you all the best you absolute legend.
Thank you for everyting Boss!
verrückt
Thank you for everything boss ❤  you will always be here
this a kennedy day  for fans of football ,
😭😭😭😭 pleasee win premier league 😭
Thanks you boss, now we need  statue for you!!!

I'm shockee boss 😭😭 Thank you, Juergen. Thank you very much ❤
well I'm manchester united fan but i love this man full respect to him and wish him all the best
Respect klopp,thanks for the great memories go and spend time with your family and your wife and relax and watch Liverpool on the TV and turn up to a few games now and again.But before you go let's leave on a high.💯💯
Liverpool are in a great position mainly thanks to this man, the backing of the board and the fans. As much as this news is upsetting and the league slightly entertaining, the future is bright for the club, we will survive and Klopp will always be remembered as one of the greatest Liverpool managers ever.
im crying 😭
Jurgen, you have done more than enough for the club, the supporters, and the city. You have touched us all in so many different ways. My life has seen a lot of changes since you first took charge, and having you as a constant was truly a stabilizing force. We all respect your reasons for leaving, and wish you the best. Thank you, Jurgen. YNWA
Alles Gute, Jürgen.
i never wanted this to ever happen.  he is liverpool. klopp forever.
Thank you Jurgen..simply the best
Respect from united fan
Well he's done the best n I suppose now we have to show we're Liverpool, time to identify his worthy successor at the earliest, Ljinders, Iraola, but not Gerard n Rodgers, even Conte, Rangnick seem worthy candidates
Lebih sakit dari pada di putusin 💔
Best of luck with this man 😮going to miss a man like him and seeing what he’s done to Liverpool all the cups and trophies he’s got for them and they all go out with a bang for Kloop 😮😮😮😁🥲👊
😭😭😭😭 YNWA❤
Damn he looks tired as hell.
When you walk through a storm Hold your head up high And don't be afraid of the dark😭❤️
Mr Klopp
Give the title push all you’ve got and then rest up:) we love you, Jurgen.
as a Leeds fan i will be sorry to see him go great manager
Once you are red, you are red forever ❤
I know exactly what he means. Still sad but happy for him.
Beautiful brilliant man ..respect and thanks to jurgen ❤
wish you the best jurgen💖💖
💔😭😭😭
xabi alonso is the best possible replacement for them, former liverpool champions league winner and has proven himself at leverkusen being the only undefeated team in europe this season.
Thank You Mr Klopp. Thank you for bringing us back to the perch that this great club deserves. You will forever remain in Liverpool folklore! THANK YOU!!!
I say give it to Pep Linders! The Players will feel comfortable with him!
Absolute Legend status, thank you for everything Jurgen, not only for all the succes and for transforming the club to where it belongs again, simply for being an amazing human being who makes this sport better with your personality and values. The entire world of football wishes you all the luck in your life. Thank you again Jurgen!
He is exhausted due to hectic work, he deserves a break... Maybe one day we will see him as RMFC manager once Carlo leaves or may be Barca will try to grab this opportunity as they are in mud.  To be honest clubs like manu deserve his guidance unfortunately he started he will never work in England against Liverpool.  He is a great coach no doubt.
YNWA 😥😥
Stalwart.
Godspeed ❤❤❤❤
Thanks to Klopp we will continue to get better, because he says so…
Klop is going to Madrid.
He's the best man I've had in my short life. And that will never change forever ‼︎ Thanks a lot and will give all of us to him🔥 YNWA, Klopp❤️‍🔥
😢😢😢😢
klopp take a break  and refill the tank, and better sure to come back
I was expecting lifetime contact for him 😢😢😢😢... Please don't leave Kloppo
Bit early for an April fools lads
You Will Never Walk Alone
Simple message for mr Sloppy thank you and all the best
😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔
I've watched videos of people being hung, natural disasters ruining towns and even watched the movie Cats. This is by far the worst video I've ever seen.
he feels like it’s time to enjoy his life with his family now and sick off not having a normal life dnt blame him must be horrible when ye can’t go anywhere without been tortcherd but he’s done he’s part now
Thanks for everything Jürgen. You made us dream again!! YNWA
Nothing but respect, you have done a great job at the club. Enjoy your time away from the football.
I sad🥲
What is the point of living
We will miss you COACH❤️🫡
I think us liverpool fans seem to have more belief in him, that he does himself. Id rather klopp at 50 percent, than anyone else.
I respect his decision. I always will, but it's a heartbreaking one, I'm literally crying. This wonderful man gave us, gave me, so many superb, glorious memories. It's difficult to imagine it's the last months we have with him. Thank you for everything, Jürgen, but God, will we miss you. You'll always be Liverpool.  You'll Never Walk Alone ❤️
Xabi Alonso will take over
Huge loss for the Premier League. What an absolute Legend...Enjoy the Holidays...Jurgen. YNWA MOT
Thank you for everything good luck boss
Respekt!
❤this is hurting him big time and to act now gaves liverpool kloop time to get the next manger in we need someone who plays attacking football this will be positive but its gut wrenching ❤❤❤❤❤❤we love you build a statue for kloop
Someone wake me up from this nightmare. 😭
Heartbroken 💔 Best manager we’ve ever had you’ll always be in Liverpool hearts Jurgen! Next up, Please take over Southgate and bring it home for England! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Come to FCSB !
THis is big news.   We have a squad that not all managers can manage, we cant have big names come in who are used to big money. I am hoping its Xabi Alonso.   I hope we can win the league this season one last time before going into the unknown.
serious question…   why? like its Feb we on the way to win carabao cup europa league, like why tho? anyone knows? my heart cant handle this, this is too sudden like why..
Gutted! I’ve been dreading this day for many years now but now it’s out there and we have a date he is going is heartbreaking.  Thank You for everything Jurgen   YNWA
Does pep stay?
I'm heartbroken! I've supported Liverpool since the mid 90's and what he's done with this team is amazing, the philosophy, the comoraderie, the emotions, the ups and downs, I've loved it all. I really hope we win the league to see him off. YNWA Jurgen
Bring Xabi Alonso.
Offer him a year off put Lijnders in charge for a year or even 2 years. Then bring him back
im dying here
Klopp Legacy and impact is as MASSIVE as Shankly
so sad!
Farewell to an absolute legend! Thank goodness we still have a few months with him! Lets make a moment to remember! Quadruple loading... 🤞 YNWA HERR KLOPP!!
What a legend! I knew this moment will come, but not so soon… no matter where you go, you’ll always be on our heart Jürgen. Liverpool has your back! You’ll Never Walk Alone❤️
He’s leaving us in a far better position than when he started his management at Liverpool……YNWA ..
I'm quite confident that Liverpool will win the EPL this season. Only fitting for the team to give him the title as a parting gift. What a manager!
💔💔💔💔💔💔
I can't believe it absolutely gutted you  are leaving us boss omg I thought you'd be with us for years to come,i hope you're not unwell or you have family issues plus I'm hoping this isn't fsg's fault.thank you for the many years of success it will not be the same not seeing you on the touch line or in are dug out for us,38 years I've supported my beloved LFC and you have been one of the best we have had.thank you for you're time I hope you an you're family all the best in the future in whatever you decide to do. Win.lose.or draw you'll never walk alone. Who will be the new manager I hope it's someone who is up to the Job I honestly do. YNWA
Im a spurs fan but the job this guy did was unimaginable I’ll even rate it higher than pep, changed the way Liverpool was viewed as a club, three champions league finals, constantly contending for the Orem and winning it, winning everything imaginable, another final this season and could win europa, I don’t know where Liverpool go from here but this man carried this club to glory
People respect Mourhino , people admire Gurardiola , but people love Jurgen . For Liverpool fans he's their favorite , for fans who support another team he's the second favorite manager . Not only will Liverpool miss him , but the premiership as a whole will miss him .
Respect to Klopp. He is in my opinion the best manager/coach in the world. If he had the same kind of players like Pep, he would have won more. Made unknown/little known players better, played great football. And I’m a United fan!
Gonna miss him so much 😢
Massive respect for Klopp/ United fan
Jürgen is a Legend <3
What about Liverpool 2.0???😭😭😭😭😭
This hurts.
Knew that this day was coming but i also knew whenever the day comes, i would not be ready.
i hate 2024 already! but i appreciate everything you have done for our club Jürgen and i wish you nothing but the best in whatever you do, thankyou for all the amazing memories, success and more YNWA
wow my coach manzy build him a statue at Anfield
😮😮😢😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Liverpool for the quad this season! Give this man the best ending he deserves
Oh no, Jurgen I'm not prepared for this but It's okay I understand and respect your decision. You will always be our legend. Once a red, always a red. YNWA ❤❤❤
I’m devastated to hear this but the reasons behind it make perfect sense, He deserves to go and have a normal life and focus on his family. All the best you absolute legend ❤️
YNWA Klopp..now get xabi alonso in
Hate to say it, this could make Salah go to.
Legend ❤
Between the refereeing and all the games this season, this one's been exhausting
This brings tears to everyones eyes,  Thank You Klopp for everything.
Have you ever come across such a humble guy. He states he's just a normal guy who wants to live a normal life. He's not normal, he's a man of rare quality. The game will miss him, not just the Liverpool fans.
Statue need to be built and unveiled by the end of the season
Love you Klopp <3 <3
the GOAT Jurgen Klopp❤️  this is without a doubt have something to do with the owners, behind close door Klopp prob has been patient with them for too long & he couldn’t take it anymore
For me too 3 managers what he has done for Liverpool is incredible
😢😢😢
My heart breaks hearing this. We love you Jurgen. We love you. Thank you for giving us our club back. YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE!!!!!!!
That's us fucked then!🤷‍♂️
He still needs to win 12 more EPL titles...Why quit now...
I don't watch football and it's not my thing but do so as my partner loves it (not Liverpool fan) . I know of all the shtick of banter between fans and clubs but this goes beyond that this man was wonderful for Liverpool, a class act and he has done so much for the club and has announced this so well. Very articulate and explained it in a way that everyone cam understand.  Well done Klopp, get out there and explore and live your life and do things you couldn't get to do. Best of luck for the future. You made Liverpool into a wonderful team and left it in great form for a new and fresh energised manager. What a man 💪
Sad but inevitable day, we'll surely miss him but glad he's healthy and is looking to move his life elsewhere. I'd love to see him revitalise the German national team
I am sure he will go to Real Madrid
Liverpool FC,The Beatles,Jurgen Klopp!!!!
This is extremely sad, but I believe this is going to make us win the league!!!! It is going to galvanize everyone. Lets go!!!
Liverpool must win epl this season, the best farewell gift for klopp
Don’t do it, please !!! 😢😢😢😢
Danke Klopp and all staff🥳🥳🥳🤠  Thanks Mrs ula klopp for your support ❤️❤️ God bless aall your family
sad day for me as liverpool fans . Gerrard & J Klopp leave liverpool. 😢😢😢
Now what we gonna do gutted is an understatement .......Start tapping up Alonso
Poch regretting taking the Chelsea job so soon
As a Mancunian, I have great respect and admiration for you Mr. Jurgen Klopp for what you have done at this football club, the adversary of Manchester United but also for the Premier League.
He is up there with Shanks, Bob and Kenny in my eyes.  Absolutely gutted to hear this, but if it is for his health then i fully understand.  I'll always be proud that Jurgen is and will always be a red.
Thank you Mr. Jurgen Klopp. We will miss you a lot & thank you for everything.
So its last dance for Liverpool. Hope the players will give him a good farewell season.
FSGout
Legend, if alonso wins the bundesliga they may go for him
I hate that he's leaving but he gotta do what's right for him😢 please manage the England squad 🙏 we might win something 😂
I wish wenger would have known when to step down. This isn't easy to do by the way. Respect to Klopp for knowing when he can call it ahead of time.
se va a extranar a caramusica!!
Like many people here, I am shocked and sad at the same time that Jürgen will be leaving Liverpool FC at the end of the season. He made the club great again and the long-awaited successes including the national championship came back to Anfield after 30 years. Jürgen is currently the best coach in the world, there is no doubt about that. He is professional enough to know or assess when it is time for him to go. There is a saying in Germany that says: "Man sollte gehen, wenn es am schönsten ist". It means you should quit at the peak of your career. And he's right. Jürgen, I wish you all the best for the future from the bottom of my heart and stay as you are. You are a great person and a legend. Kind regards from Germany, Valentin.
Why? No. Please.
Now the player have to win the league no matter what for klopp the legend
`What a main, what a legend ! end with a bang ...
During his time, Anfield grow larger and larger. Brand New Training and Academy facility. More and more Academy players is becoming First Team Player. Build a team that can Win Games. Won ALL Trophies. Gave us Memorable and Unforgatable Memories on the pitch. And Last but not Least, he turn us from Doubters to Believers.
Left because of numerology (gematria) the guys a massive M@SON ffs. Get the next f4eemason in…
It'll be impossible to find someone with so much heart, personality and talent like Jurgen. ❤
Сразу после услышанного, это разбивает сердце. Но это должно было когда-то случиться. Тренировать в таком ритме...Конечно ему нужен отличный отпуск, отдохнуть от футбола пару лет. И когда почувствует что скучает и готов, вернуться в футбол снова. И может быть, снова в Ливерпуль, кто знает. У меня есть такое чувство.
“Ran out of energy” bored of being 2nd best to pep
KLOPP YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE.
YNWA❤️
his positivity is contagious, all of my respect to the man he’s done brilliant for the reds, and carefully considered when it was best to leave, as for his own energy to not hinder into the club, that takes a lot of courage, and strength thank you jurgen klopp, one of liverpools greats, premier league greats, and german greats, there will be a statue one day at anfield
You’ll never walk alone
True definition of a legend❤️He will never be forgotten
😢😢😢😢😢
This is sooooo SUDDEN!!! Something has gone on that’s for sure.. You can’t be on top of the World getting to Wembley top of the Prem in the Europa in the FA Cup then 48hrs later come out with this Bombshell… Think!!!!!!!
Thank you for everything Jurgen! You’ve given us everything for nearly 9 years. This day was always coming. Thank you for the great memories you gave us. YNWA
You are loved, valued, appreciated and respected always. Burnout is real and as tough as it is that you wont be there next season. We want whats best for you because you have given it all and left it all on the pitch for us. Do you. Forever a Kloppite❤
thankyou for everything Mr.Klopp ❤
You will always be a Liverpool legend! Thank you for everything Klopp. I wish you nothing but the best for your future
Gutted
From Manchester City fans Klopp leaving is very sad as we just don't who else will be able to challenge Pep to stay at Manchester City & continue fighting for the Titles like Klopp did. Never wanted Liverpool & Klopp to beat Manchester City to any Title but I honestly never expected he will leave this soon. I should be happy he's leaving but for whatever reason I can't explain it feels upsetting & sad. If there is any other Manager I'd swap Pep for it's definitely Klopp.
❤️
We love and support you, Klopp❤❤❤
Great manager iam a man united fan he should come and be next united boss come on jurgen 😅😅😅
We will miss you so much ❤
No I will not believe this. No I won't
Trying to take on Lance Armstrong FC has definitely taken its toll on him.
Noo don’t let him LEAVE!
As Mr. Klopp informed the club about his decision in November, I hope the club had already secured an agreement with Xabi Alonso as Klopp's replacement.
Nooooo
Klopp to real madrid Alonso to liverpool
So sad right now.  We must win the treble this season!!
Great message at the end. What a man.
YNWA❤
Oh no 😭😭😭😭
Why am I crying? 😢
Damn.. hard one .... LEGEND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
I fell sorry for all Liverpool fans and the club he is a great manager and gentleman good luck in the future Klopp ,
Im crying.
Sad sad day ❤
I love the way he's so honest🫡 Always gonna be a legend ❤
Nothing is forever. Wishing you all the best. Liverpool loves you and You are real class manager heir Klopp
Danke Jürgen
YNWA❤❤  we loved you Klopp!!!! you’ll always be remembered at this club
Welcome to Bayern Munich the best club in the world
My heart just shattered, I love this man . I will miss his energy, Wish you all the best
Every fan of football can admit that jurgen has been one of best managers in the world and liverpool. Good luck for your future jurgen
YNWA❤ MISS U
Bring the premier league trophy back to anfield this season, he deserves to parade that trophy more than ever since he never got the chance to
my day ruined......
Now let’s get the PL trophy, Fa Cup, carabao cup and European cup for Jürgen! Thanks Jürgen for all the years you’ve given us
LFC for 40 years .... This is a bad news for my birthday. Thank you very much for your hard work. Wish you are happy boss. With love from Thailand.
He need rest i respect that ..
LEAVE THE CLUB AS A LEGEND AND NOT CARRY ON ABIT LIKE ROY AT PALACE IS DOING AT LEAST JURGEN HAS THE BOTTLE TO ADMIT IT AND BE HOMEST WITH EVERYONE 👏😢⚽️
As a Liverpool fan, we'd hate to see you leave us, but we understand that it's been taxing on you after all these years, and everyone is grateful for the time we've had together.   You've been the best manager one could dream of having, and we appreciate everything!
What has happened guys  pls sit down and sort out the differences because after  klopp it will be difficult for us to maintain the level of the players and the spirit of the team
Legend Jurgen Klopp, you're the best attacking manager in the modern football!!!! It's painful to see this happen💔, but YNWA. Wishing best of luck for you future endeavors!!! Thank you for everything!!!! ❤🙏
I am speechless
Time to offer xavi alonso a boatload of money
lebron james punching the air rn
As a Liverpool fan from outside England since the 90s, thank you for providing many enjoyable years with such extraordinary achievements.
What a legend I'll never forget you Klopp just have a rest and come back YNWA
I think Klopp will go en coach Germany next
Just another manager tired of being second best to Pep and City. Another one bites the dust.
Bye bye
Always will be my manager ❤
Crying and throwing up
❤❤❤
The questions that the interviewer should have asked: Any thoughts on your successor? Any potential candidates you think that can build on what your system of football? How are the players taking the news?  When were they told? What was the locker-room reaction?
Love him, but he’s to modest, genius at work needs to continue his legacy..
Just as I thought my year had started off to a great start. 😢
Gutted but grateful he brought me so much joy.
💔
Thanks Jurgen, you gave us hope. Then belief, then Greatness. You will be sorely missed but good luck wherever you go. YNWA
What a guy, gave it his all but this is football, roll on Xabi Alonso 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Always love  ....it's hard to accept that from the next season onwards you won't be part of the club...major miss for our club mate...love you lot klopp...YNWA ....you will always  be with us....
A big surprise, but great honesty, and he is a legend.
Oh no
Thank you Jurgen
All I can say is, Thank you Thank You Thank You. Thank you Jurgen for everything ❤ YNWA
Thank your Jurgen for everything you done until now, we go again til the end of the season !  YNWA
You turned doubters into believers   I'm super emotional about his leaving.  We will always love him as a manager, he was really dedicated to us❤
Well, that's a bad start to the day, isn't it? Devastating news.   Good luck in everything you do, Jurgen! I can't listen to this and be angry with the news. It's bittersweet but Jurgen has given me so many fantastic memories and my respect for him has just reached a new level which I didn't think it could.  Stepping down because he feels it's right and he won't be able to do the same job next season? That takes so much courage. This is cheesy as hell coming from a fully grown man but seriously, boss, thank you for the memories.   You've made my life better during really difficult times. Thank you.
Thank you Jurgen Klopp for 8 years 😭❤️❤️
PEP doing backflips in his office just hearing the KLOPP news
Thank you for bringing Mo Salah to the team….❤
Spurs fan here. Gutted. He's a legend and has made not just Liverpool but the Premier league so much better.....😫
Good luck Boss, we'll support you forever  Thank you for everything  YNWA❤
😭😭😭😭😭
He has more than earned the right to walk away on his own terms. Thank you for all the work you've put in to our club ❤
OH! NOOOOOOOOOOO!! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  JURGEN KLOPP   😮 😮 😔 😟 😭 😭 😭 😭  I CAN'T FIND THE WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW. THIS NEWS IS HEART BREAKING...  I LOVE YOU, JURGEN KLOPP. ALWAYS WILL. ALWAYS WILL ALWAYS ALWAYS WILL  😭 😭 ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
I'm not a fan of Liverpool. But i always wish them good luck just bcz of my fav klopp! ❤
Devastated but so thankful that Jurgen was a red ❤
I am sad that the boss has to leave the club but I wish him happiness and success and be loved by the Kop forever.
I've love this club since I was a kid... And it's more n more..because of you Sir.. 😢😢😢
All the love in the world for Jürgen. ❤
Vielen Dank Jürgen!! Thanks for everything, especially putting us back on the map and turning us from doubters to believers! However, if you change your mind, please come back!
In my 25yrs as a Liverpool fan I have never felt this low... Build a statue for this Legend
terima kasih Jurgen Klopp.  from: Indonesia.
Fantastic Manager ❤. Humility shown but he moves when he is ready. Bigger shock. The Backroom staff leaving also.  Club needs to address what is going on.
Even if you are a Man United,Man City,Everton,Arsenal fan it doesn't matter. Everyone loves Jurgen Klopp and he will stay forever in the history books of Liverpool
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Thank you. For everything Jurgen. Did it all for us and always our hero. YNWA
We need to give him a prade
Absolutely gutted. But wish him all the best. Has gave me plenty of good memories and lifted my mood when I'm in a strop. Top geezer.
Gutted but completely understand. What a man, what a legend. Even in his explanation of such an obviously difficult decision, the man is pure and utter Class. Klopp will be mentioned in the same breadth as Shankly, Paisley and Fagan. YNWA♥
Love you Klopp ❤ and heart breaking 😢
Next job has to be leader of the free world. He's more than a magnificent manager he's a magnificent human being with so much to offer to humanity. We love you Jürgen!
My worst nightmare has come true   What a legend, hopefully he can leave with a premier league title, carabao cup and the europa league.   Regardless of what happens this season, Klopp has cemented his name as one of the greatest we’ve seen.  Here’s to a good remainder of the season, let’s enjoy it while it last ✊
That's the premier league finished now. It will be a one team league like Scotland
what a legend! salute from manchester united fan ❤
You are a legend and will always be a Red❤ YNWA. Danke Jürgen for all the good times
I’ve start following Liverpool 8 years ago, it was best 8 years in my live. it helps me go through depression, divorcee, relocation… after that game with Barca… well you know. Thank you for everything ❤
deverastated  YNWA
Heartbreaking. But we will try to understand. YNWA Jürgen, forever a legend ❤️
One of the greatest managers alive in the game, you re the best Klopp. Y.N.W.A ❤. Anfield will always be Jurgen Klopp's historic ground
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Can only say thank you Jügen. You have given us some of best memories as a Liverpool fan! You will be sorely missed, let full steam ahead until to make this season just as memorable as the man.
❤💔
WTAF😲 didn't see this coming 😥The man is the Messiah as far as LFC Supporters are concerned, devastated
Oh man! This is tough to hear. What a manager, what a man. Enjoy your life gaffer. YNWA
YNWA
my nightmare has finally come🥲
Honest words from an honest man, YNWA
Back in the MUD. DONKEYS. COYG.
💔💔💔💔
Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp, match made in heaven. Let's make this season a special one. YNWA❤❤
I think he is the greatest Liverpool coach of all time because he inherited a midtable team low on confidence and turns Liverpool into the most consistent team feared team in the world, on a budget. And the English FA need to hire this guy after Southgate if England are ever going to win a trophy in my lifetime.
I think he understood that fighting against the amount of money Man City has got is an unfair challenge. Same bullshit challenge he had to face in Germany against Bayern Munich.  Great coach, a role model, fantastic ambassador for Germany, loved by everybody, never got sacked in his career. Xabi Alonso will follow up to him. All fine. We love him. Cheers from Thailand
W Klopp
My heart is skipped 😮
Thank you jurgen for everything over brilliant 9 years ,you are a legend and always will be .we love you from heart for everything you have done for Liverpool .Really, we will miss you! ❤ Thank you man!! ❤❤❤
✊🏿 so happy i got to experience a match live while you were our manager …
❤
Klopp deserves not one statue, but 6 ! YNWA !!
Black Friday 😢
Jurgen, Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! I am also 56 and completely understand your decision. Your contributions to Liverpool have been legendary and immeasurable. You have completely transformed LFC into the best version of itself. ❤&✌️
Jurgen you have just broken my heart. I love you more than you can imagine. Thank you for everything you have done for our club ❤😢
Basically he’s tired from the coaching job and looking for a normal life, not about health,family and fog.
Time to bring Ange to his boyhood hero,s.
You need to get ange in the door.he’s the only man that can take on this role.
damn.. too soon to say goodbye..hope liverpool pick manager like klopp..his personality and mindset is just what i wanted for this club.
He’s the best manager but he’s even a better man, all the best Jurgon, You will never walk alone 💫
Mate no one will replace you ❤
He said... he isn't sure if he will continue as a manager but if it ever happens, He will never manage any other team in England other than Liverpool, never. Respect.
Thank you for everything! 😭
We love you! Thanks for everything. I'm so glad you came, you was brilliant for the club and for the Premier League. It's going to be weird without you. Let's win the league this season!!
OMFG……
As a Liverpool fan I’m devastated because I never thought this day was ever coming.    😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I am in tears. I absolutely love this club, but I think this is going to be the last season that I watch football. Can't take this whole PGMOL being rigged against us, and now Klopp leaving. Can't digest this anymore 😭😭😭
Not only did he develop the spirit in the club, but the city as well. He will be missed by LFC, the city and EPL as well
Salah will definitely leave after this season 😢
One of the best to grace the Sidelines of Anfield.
Fun guy to have in the league. Gonna miss him even as an Arsenal fan
Interviewer should‘ve said „we respect your decision because we love you“ at the end…
no way
YNWA❤
Can't take the pain of Jurgen Klopp leaving my darling LFC, wish him the very best.
Rivalry Asides, One of the Best PL Manager I've ever seen !! Good luck Jurgen, Stay Safe and Stay healthy.
Build this guy a statue already
Why 😢😢😢😢
Thank you for everything. I hope you are in good health and will have your normal life returned after this. Let's have an amazing special season and sign off for you.
We are grateful to Klopp for transforming the club and winning every trophy.  Legend, Greatest manager in the history of football. Thank you Jurgen for everything. YNWA
We love you Klopp.  We appreciate your honesty.  We appreciate your love for the team and the fans.   This is a gut punch but the amount of respect we have for you is massive.  Everything you gave Liverpool came straight from the heart, and it shows.   I wish you all the best wherever you go, and we will never forget what you have done for our club.  Thank you Juergen, from the bottom for my heart.
Why today TT
He will probably become germanys next national coach.
We are with you klopp
Thank you Jürgen for making supporting Liverpool such a joy all these years, so many beautiful memories, I wish you all the health and happiness in the world.
A legend for Liverpool and for football world!!😊
He built for us, the generation of Liverpool fans who saw the club wilt, - albeit for some occasional moments of brilliance -, the greatest team in the world. He showed us why Liverpool is historically one of the most iconic clubs in the history of the game. He brought us back to our 80s standards, and dare I say exceeded them. He played the best game we've ever seen at Anfield. He won it all. He gave the people joy. He made us proud again. It will be hard without you but you showed us the way. Whatever happens next, DANKE JÜRGEN! You deserve some valuable rest. PL can be very mentally exhausting and you pulling it off for 9 years shows that you showed resilience. I will personally miss you. Will never forget the day we hired you. I was 12 years old and I knew that Liverpool's fortunes would change for the better. We better pull off a proper send out this season with a second PL title and the single title you couldn't win with us, the Europa League. Jürgen, you've been on the Pantheon of Liverpool legends. We'll never forget you, Anfield will always have a seat available for you whenever you feel pleased. Thanks for everything, we'll miss you dearly!  YNWA ♾️
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I have no idea what to say, who ever Klopp manage next , I wouldn't want Liverpool to face him, I am very sad about this announcement
thanks for 9 years ,hope you will success good luck ❤❤
You simply have to respect this man. ❤
Bruh please no 😔
😢😢😢 a legend we will miss you terribly but you look tired the pressure of managing our iconic club is hard you are our hero👏🇮🇪🇮🇪
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The best manager in the world <3 <3
As boro fc I enjoy watching play under klopp
Lets appreciate the last few months we have with him, whatever happens. We can only hope we ever see a manager like him at the club again. Lets have a 100ft statue of him punching the air, with glowing red eyes standing menacingly over the the away coach parking bay
We respect ur decision. Bless u cz bring our glory 30yrs ago
Danke Jürgen Klopp! All the best in your future endeavour!
Sangat mendadak
Thank you Jurgen! A red legend❤ YNWA
😭😭😭
😢💔
THANK YOU FOR THE LAST 8 YEARS. YOU ARE LIVERPOOLS BEST MANAGER. I WISH YOU THE BEST FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I PRAY YOU STAY IN GREAT HEALTH
Its on players/fans now to end Klopp's era with Quadruple. He deserves that.
NOOOOOO 😢😢😢  I CAN'T DO THIS. I don't want a Liverpool without Klopp 😭😭😭
We will miss you ❤
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺He might be having cancer or something🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Thank You Jurgen. From Doubters into believers THANKS TO YOU
Klopp embodies what Liverpool football club is and should be moving forward. Going to be missed so much and is irreplaceable, but he’s left us in the best position to succeed. Absolute legend.🔴🔴🔴
I think he is retiring and not just taking a sabbatical, and it is well earned. The thing is that you can't get over the fact that we won't see him in dugout next season, it feels strange already.
This must be because of the documentary
Ini terlalu mengejutkan
I was never a football fan until point in 2015 I started a new job and everyone that I worked with was always talking about the Premier League in which I did not know what this was.   To fit in (as you do) I asked around and researched the clubs in the prem and at the time everyone I spoke to said Liverpool was an underdog team which  had me hooked.   I started watching highlights and replays of Liverpool games and at the time Brendan Rogers got sacked and Jurgen Klopp came in and the rest is history!  I have had the biggest highs and lows as a Liverpool supporter (in Australia) and this was all down to Jurgen.   I am absolutely gutted as this has been my manager for my whole supporter lifespan but I completely understand Jurgen's position and I wish him and his family all the best!  Thank you!
😅😅😅😅
Everything has an expiration date: You have run your race Boss. Go well.
Noooo😢😢 thank you for everything Jurgen ❤️
The Normal One is indeed the embodiment of 'The man, the myth, the legend!' Thank you for everything, Boss. The last eight and a half years have been quite a ride, and in my lifetime, there has never been a better time to relish being a Liverpool fan. You don't owe us anything; we owe you a lot! YNWA! ❤❤❤
Heart Breaker 😢
He's going to Real Madrid
You are a legend Klopp i have known you since i was 3 years old and you have always been my favourite manager in the world i cant imagen a Liverpool whitout you my honest reaction is GOD TELL ME WHY!!   YNWA ❤
This is the worst news ever 😢
Jürgen leaving on his own terms says everything we need to know about the man. A true legend, hopefully they can win the league this season. Would be the greatest parting gift!
Shock of the season!  Thank you Jurgen and we respect your decision. At the end of the day, your health and family is far more important than football. The door will always be open if you do change your mind and come back. YNWA❤
It's a sad day for us to have heard this. One only positive from this is that Liverpool will have more than enough time to prepare for next season (finding new managers etc.) but all in all, Thank you Mr. Jurgen Klopp for everything that you've done. You kept your promises. You changed us from doubters to believers. You delivered us titles. You will forever earn our highest respects. Even though I'm not alive to experience the Shankley and Paisley era, I'm very proud to experience the Klopp era. YNWA
Klopp will always be a legend at the club
A loss for the club and for the Liverpool fans. Klopp added beauty and enthusiasm to football with his movements, his personality, and his reaction when scoring goals... He made the Liverpool team a global team, and Liverpool will mourn his departure, but this is life. A man comes and a man goes... Thank you for what you gave to the club and we will always remember you.
Klopp has been the best For us, he didn’t have much money on his side unlike Man City but still managed to created a brilliant side that is more than capable to win every thing, we will miss him.  YNWA❤
My gosh this news just made my day into a sad one 😢. Now that the boys know of this news, they better give their whole guts out for this man and win the quadruple this season in honor of this legendary man’s legacy!!🏆🏆🏆🏆 YNWA Jurgen Norbert Klopp ❤️
The team must win the league for Klopp. He deserves another one. 😢😢😢😢
I will never forget you💔💔
ก่อนไปขอ4แชมป์เลยนะ♥️♥️♥️
No Gerard please
Make Klopp stand in stadium lfc
Im now sat in the corner hugging my knees and sobbing. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
legend❤️❤️
My Heart 😢💔💔💔💔
Thank you for everything! I'll always love you <3 YNWA
I had a funny feeling when he signed the new contract 1 or 2 years ago, i had a feeling this would happen. This man is LFC. Build him a statue YNWA❤
ไม่น้าาาาาาาาา…. TT TT I’ll always have you in my heart boss เศร้าฉิบหาย
XAVI ALONSO?
This is heartbreaking. I'm distraught. Man, my day ... as long as you're fine Klopp then all is well in the end, but damn....damn
Alonso is ready to come in. Pep soon leaving, time for Newcastle & Arsenal to dominate English football
Love you klopp ynwa
Kloppo...all I can say is thank you for the last 8 years and it has been 1 he'll of a ride. Still have a few more months left with you and I hope we take a trophy or 2...maybe 3...or even a quad . All the best from Paul from Australia.  YNWA.
I can’t think of a single manager good enough to fill his shoes. Any replacement will be a downgrade 😔
What a man, what a manager, what a legend, words cannot describe how grateful I am so I'll just keep it ahort and simple, Thank you for everything youve done dor us Jürgen Klopp, let's end the season on a high and wish you well in everything after the season ends YNWA❤️❤️❤️
Klopp has signed Legendary players and changed this club single handedly YNWA ❤
Devastated.
A day I wasn't ready for at all. This is going to take a long time to accept. What he's done for this club is defined by more than just the trophies he's helped us win. We were completely down in the dumps... lacking the belief or the quality to compete, one of the biggest clubs in England and the world despite our recent form rather than because of it.  He came in and changed everything. We all became believers thanks to him. I've been a Liverpool supporter for 12 years now and have seen the club under Hodgson, Rodgers, and now Jurgen. He's given us Liverpool supporters the most special moments in many of our lives and I can only say thank you. He's brought a lot of pride and joy and I hope the squad and us supporters can do our bit to help him go out on a high. He needs our energy now more than ever.  Danke schon Jurgen You'll Never Walk Alone
The boss knows best YNWA
Liverpool will struggle now get in there
Volvi a ser hincha del futbol por este club como yo queria, y me volvi creyente cuando llego klopp Gracias liverpool y jurgen por devolverme la vida de hincha. Sere rojo hasta el final Saludos desde 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????
i wish he is lying
Xavi Alonso, come on down.
I don't think I'll ever stop crying
YES YES YES We'll always remember you our Hero ❤❤❤❤
I am not prepared for this as a Liverpool fan💔
1. Xabi Alonso 2. Hans flick  3. De zerbi  I think only this 3 candidate can maintenance Liverpool standard
This Very Very Shock News for Liverpool fans 😭😭 Please Jurgen We Need you , We Love You 🥺🥺 Please Dont Do This , You’re Legend For All of Us 🥺🥺😭😭😭
I am already crying
Thank you klopp...thank you for everything you do in Liverpool....we will always remember you....
Thanks for everything gaffer! please get Xabi Alonso warmed up now!... I can see him having a year off coming back as Germany manager and winning the world cup 🇩🇪 🏆 ☕️🐸
He will forever be a legend in this club we won’t forget u YNWA🔴
Just want to say, Thank You. You really turned doubter to believers. Up the reds let’s win it all this year!
I'm uncontrollably sobbing right now.
I LOVE YOU!! YNWA❤️
Amazing coach
I am absolutely devasted by this news.  But I will eternally be grateful for what Jurgen Klopp has done for the club I love so much.  Thank you BOSS.  YNWA❣
"Let's Talk About Six, Baby" - Jurgen Klopp  01 June 2019 🫂 YWNA❣️
what are the odds this is a deepfake?
Great manager from a Forest fan. He'll be missed by all in football😮.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 all the best JK wherever you go. Now let us finish well
I can't believe this...I'm literally crying right now 😭😭
It been 8 year my happiness is never end each and every day!  But to day I am upset 😢
Finally i wont be bound to any club anymore I can chill while watching prem league..since the man who made me love liverpool has left today Ahhh it was a long and nice journey..thank you klopp❤❤❤
Man I really will miss u
Barcelona already contacted their bank manager looking for a billion ball ...
Brilliant manager, nice guy.👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
First Berrada, now Klopp. Jim making moves.
the Best on more level's, will be difficult, if not impossible to replace...😢
Goodbye legend ❤
As a uinted fan its a sad day for the league
Noooooooo!!!!!! Shocking!!! It can't be, but we have to accept that the day will eventually come. Didn't expect to be so soon. I thought Klopp would extend his contract for a couple more years. 😢 I swear I would shed rivers at the end of the season. 😭 Let's win every trophy possible for him this season ❤ YNWA!! On another note, is he opening the door for Xabi Alonso to be the next manager?
All the best Klopp ❤
This is really sad news. I'm an Arsenal fan but I like Jurgen Klopp and I've enjoyed watching the Liverpool teams he has built. I honestly thought it was a joke when I saw the video thumbnail.
No
17:05 “I will never manage a different club in England than Liverpool. That is not possible” THANK YOU KLOPP FOR EVERYTHING WE WILL MISS YOU! YNWA
😭😭😭😭
This is so sad. 😢😢😢😢😢
Is this a joke???
I hope he is in good health. Thanks for the laughs and the trophies Kloppo.   On to Xabi.
good news
🥹
so dramatic ahahahahahahaha
YNWA, he is and will do down as a legend of this club
We love you Jurgen. 😢
We understand to you, we will love you forever
Please build a statue for Jurgen 💔
My heart is broken I have no words .....he made our dreams into reality.
🥺😭😭😭
pep confirmed he will leave next season
Our generation's Shankly moment....gutted
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He is the best thing that happened to LFC in a long long time. Much respect and love ❤
welcome to barca
Arsenal fan here, but I have to admit that what Klopp has done, and accomplished with Liverpool, he is an icon of football, him and HIS team lives up there with the greats of the game. He has left his legacy.
I remember watching the first press conference in 2015, to think it's almost 10 years. We will not be the club we are without Jurgen. YNWA, you'll always be in pur hearts.
Love you Kloppo! Thank you for all these years, making us dream again! Still feeling unreal for having you as our manager.
You will never walk alone ❤
I'm still a normal guy but I don't live a normal life. LFC made him grow. He left Dortmund as a warrior, he will leave Liverpool as a leader and wise man.  Respect from a German guy. Heja BVB and YNWA
There will never be another Jurgen Klopp🥲 YNWA❤
Xabi Alonso next. Will miss you klopp. Thank you so much. ❤❤
Im greatful for this man at this team.  Its a tough one but he deserves to walk away as opposed to him getting sacked. All the best Kloppo
im crying
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
im legit sad
I am heartbroken, couldn't love Klopp more if I tried
Lets see if Liverpool can still mock Man utd once they lose Klopp 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thanks for everything Jurgen !!!! U been the best , ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm not crying you are 😢 he is a legend and he will be sorely missed. But you heard what he said it's back to business. Let's get behind the team. YNWA
Very sad news, thank you Jurgen for all you have done for the club and wishing you all the best for the future. YNWA
No No No  Please tell me this isn’t happening 😢  It’s as bad as when Shankly left, I’m absolutely gutted, but I wish him all the very best he is a legend and always will be, love this man to bits .  Jürgen Klopp you will be in our hearts forever Sir, Thankyou for everything 😢😥 🫡    “You’ll Never Walk Alone Jurgen “
Thank you for everything gaffer all the best with your future endeavors
Disappointed. He could have called Fenway out on their greed. But he never did. He's won a couple of massive trophies, but no more. Mainly down to Fenway's greed. He says he's 100% LFC, but he moves on?  Why not just have a year off every 4 or 5 years? Seems to be like he went from burning out, to completely burnt out.  Anyway, Xabi Alonso sounds like the most talked about but he's still very much a rookie.
Devastated, hoping for him to extend more year, ended up leaving at the end of season. The hardest part is accepting that the coaching staff will leave one by one after Jurgen. 💔
Devastating news .. YNWA Jurgen
Oh no 😢
Mr Klopp, thank you so much for the memories and the unforgettable moments I never thought I’d see you really turned us from doubters to believers thank you ❤️
Klopp is the best manager for Liverpool
Nooooo🥲🥲💔💔
German national team next
I wish he would consider a year-long sabbatical and leave himself the option of returning.
What an incredible manager for Liverpool. Fans of the club will remember forever what he has achieved with the club. I really hope Liverpool manage to get Xabi Alonso, he would be the perfect choice for Klopps successior for next season. Thank you Jürgen, YNWA
I have no words 😢
I’m not crying you’re crying 😢
LMAO.  WHAT A LOVELY MORNING. 😅
Please don't leave 😢😢😢
Kloppo was the best guy in England but even the best man has to finally listen to the woman and the woman always knows best. I mean the woman at home-:)   Liverpool fans can be proud of themselves and Kloppo
Im shocked, but I respect his decision, it only shows how much he cares about the club!
Build this man a statue right now. Thanks for the amazing memories.
kloop left because mbappe is joining real madrid.
I've always liked and respected Klopp. Brilliant manager. Glad he's going, because he is too good and has inflicted misery on me (us)! But sad to see someone like him leave our league, for sure.
Its like Dalglish all over again... heart breaking
NOOOOOOOOOOOO 🥺🥹🥹🥹🥹
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I already see Virgil talking to the team to give their soul to this season for the Boss. I can see Ali cry at the end, the whole team together celebrating whatever title we will win and see myself cry thinking about this journey which is just one of a kind and probably the greatest story that was ever told in modern football history. The whole build to winning the CL and PL, with all these tough loses but also great victories. Barca.. the emotions when winning the CL… Seeing Trent grow up, Robbo, Mo the everlasting king and of course guys like Nunez who will be the new faces but already are deeply connected to the spirit of this wonderful club. Thank you Klopp, thank you LFC, this truely is more than just football. YNWA
I am not in a good moment for sure.
Something going on we're not aware of, probably the owners.
You're a great man and manager. You brought lots of joy and enthusiasm to our club. It was the best of years in Liverpool's recent history. The best manager I've ever seen. You will be missed Jurgen. Best of luck to you and your family. YNWA
What a man. I love him even more after this interview, if that were possible
YNWA Jurgen, a ledgend of this game, club and now country. What ever your plans are in the future you will always have a home in Liverpool. You have bought the greatest of memories to me and many others. You are a wonderful manager and an even better person  YNWA
This is devastating, i cannot imagine anyone else managing LFC at this point, this makes me very sad, omg whyyyyyy!, on a positive note, he won't manage any other club in England out of Respect of Liverpool, please make him a statue, he reached the legend level.
Our greatest manager in the Premier league era thank you boss for the memories
So saaad 😢
It's incredibly sad and a great feeling of loss when you hear this. This man is an absolute inspiration to everyone. He has set a new standard for all managers that will never be reached. Proffessional, dedicated, never afraid to speak out and he remains positive through tough times lifting the fans, players and his staff.   It's hard to accept but after everything he has done for everyone in and around the club you can not help but listen to his words and appreciate this man.   You will be greatly missed and forever a red. Top bloke!
rather than let him leave id tell him to have a long deserved break for himself away from the club but let him no he will always have a role at the club if he wants to return.
What a man!What a legend! We’ll forsure be there at that Wolves game at the end of the season to give you a proper sendoff!🙌🏾YNWA❤
Going to keep Everton up 👆
In my eyes he done a fantastic job for Liverpool, winning cups, bringing in good players, restructuring the team, and there is nothing much more to ask from him, and hopefully win the title this year and leave the club in the best way possible. Hes done is time there and he should be proud for what he has accomplished.
I think he is going to Madrid or Barcelona
Worst news ever man... Finish your contract Jürgen come onnnnnnn
What a big and smart move full of love.
He might be the Normal One, But He'll always be the Most Special Person in our heart.  I will accept it Jurgen, I think everyone will do the same. Without you here, obviously everything's not gonna be the same.  But you will always stay in our heart. Every liverpool player, fans, staff, know it.  Hope you have a good future, good life, always stay humble, with a smile on your face, anywhere you go.
A club LEGEND! Right next to Bob Paisley and Bill Shankly. YNWA, Jürgen❤
PROPER LOVE OUR JURGEN ❤ Jurgen Klopp is a beautiful man and has looked after Liverpool, he cuddles them like they're his little boys.   I understand leaving a role, on good terms, when you have done a brilliant job, as opposed to staying longer and getting too run down, just to save face.    Sad to lose him but Liverpool can live on and we never forget his love and work
😭😭😭😭😭😭
thank you legend!! truly a great manager. We're gonna have huge shoes to fill
First time I heard this news I was like STFU  💔... He's been one of the greatest coaches in Liverpool history will definitely miss him
as a chelsea supporter i have nothing but respect for this great man, he loves the game, loves the club and has done such a tremendously brilliant job to represent the best not only for liverpool but for the whole of english football, he is truly one of the greats, build him a god damn statue
💔 YNWA
Absolute legend a like this it will stay forever. Love you Jurgen, YNWA ❤
Probably will not see the likes of this man again. Manager or gaffer doesn't describe him accurately, much more than a title. Always thought he changed the way football is played and set a benchmark for a Manager so very high even beyond Football.
Bring all tropies this season klopp :(
Didn’t expect this … but the man deserves to walk away when he wants … his loyalty his leadership his trust Jurgen Klopp thank you for 9 special years delivered what you said …. All best you and ulla and family once a red always a red YNWA ❤
Im not crying you are 😢
Klopp will be the greatest manager in my heart. Hope we will get Xabi Alonso next season and quadruple this season.
this has destroyed me. This man has brought so much hope, happiness and tears to my life. I only wish him the best in the future. YNWA
Leave when you are still wanted. This man has a fantastic exit strategy
Come to Juventus, please❤
Good luck for future.
Chibaba ichiiii..... What a legend...
Follow hendo to ajax
As a utd fan putting rivalry aside, my utmost respect to mr klopp for all he's done with liverpool- beyond the football, he's been really likeable (esp the initiatives towards your fans). I still don't think I'll hope for you to win the league, but if you do, I'll be the first to congratulate you!  I also genuinely hope your club manages his departure better than we did with SAF- although we're rivals, we respect the heck out of you and don't want to see you languishing after he leaves (like we have lol). That aside, I hope we improve our results vs you lot after he leaves, especially after recent seasons. At least no more 4-0, 5-0, 7-0 would be great 😂
Thank you JK for the decade you gave us🙏🏾. "We are Liverpool",  YNWA...🫡
We will miss you boss , always the best for you , always happy wherever you are  True Legend YNWA🔴
We are Liverpool ❤
Whelp. Let's make the rest of the season a party to celebrate the time we had and the memories to come! Statue at the end of the year
Thank you for Nine years
my best football memories in my entire life are all linked with this man. true legend of the game and what an exceptional person. with love from russia, thank you Jurgen❤
Whyyy no please don't leave
It breaks my heart to see this news... Klopp will always be apart of Liverpool. Nobody can replace him😭❤.. I just wish he would stay longer
Oh man, this a shock. I do understand that he is tired. All i can say is, thank you Jurgen. All the best in your life.
As a Gunner I remember being jealous of Liverpool landing jurgen as a coach. Huge news this. He is a genius. Will be missed
As a Chelsea fan This is emotional  But I wish you the best of luck,stay strong 💪.
okay, go give a normal life a try and if it doesn't work, we are waiting with open arms. this is a heartbreaking message.
เคารพนับถือการตัดสินใจของ เจอร์เก้น คล็อป์ ครับ รู้ว่าสักวันแบบนี้ต้องมาถึง แต่ไม่คิดจะเร็วขนาดนี้ครับ  ขอให้บอสโชคดีสุขภาพแข็งแรงครับ 4 แชมป์ ให้ชาวหงส์แดงทั่วโลกได้จดจำทีครับ
Let’s enjoy it while we can. Thank you for your honesty Jurgen
COME TO AJAX AMSTERDAM ❌❌❌
Build jurgen a statue. Liverpool John Moores Loves You Jurg <3
Let’s give everything for this man and win the quadruple, what a legend ❤
Thank you Jurgen Klopp. You deserve to live how you want. YNWA
Klopp ist einer der größten Trainer in der Welt 👍👍👍🏐
It is about you Jurgen. Greatness needs great leadership. You deserve all the respect in the world and hopefully we bring home the lot this year, but it will be about you and has always been about you.
Name the Annie road stand after him and get his statue ready !
come to Fenerbahce. We need leader manager like you.
YNWA 😭
MY MANAGER FOR LIFE..HE CHANGED ME AS A PERSON...HE CHANGED MY LIFE...YNWA JÜRGEN..YOU ARE LIVERPOOL FOR LIFE ❤
Man, am i gonna miss you Jurgen. What a guy you are. You epitomize Liverpool, not just the club but the people of the City too. You just get us. You turned us around when we needed it the most and I for one, although hard to take, will respect your wishes to experience 'life' with your family. Appreciate you, Now lets go smash the rest of the season!!! YNWA!!!
If he had given no reason - that would have been more than enough. He's earned his rest. Hopefully we will have a great end of season and he can come back to unveil his statue/renaming of a stand!  Remain Klopptimistic.
Thank you for everything Jurgen, no matter how the season ends you are a legend at this club. Enjoy your rest at the end of the season and hope you return to football soon.
I wish him the best enjoy your life you are a legend
There will be a lot of tear-soaked giros around Anfield today.
Im glad klopps a red 😭 thanks boss for evrthing you gave us soo much you will never walk alone
Part of me just died. 😢😢😢
We were extremely lucky to be graced with such a man. Build this man the biggest statue possible like he deserves..❤ Y.N.W.A. JURGEN ❤ Thanks for inspiring the belief.
We will alwayss love klopp❤

My legend my 9 years coach I am happy you coach my team Liverpool my heart is 💔 but I will not forget u in my mind love u boss I wish someone like u will take over when you go
I understand what he's saying. Still breaks my heart though more than any other relationship....
😢
Thanks boss😊
💔💔💔💔 noooooo 😭😭😭😭
I hope he wins the domestic Treble this season.
我人傻了😢😢😢，唯有祝好，感谢你带来的一切。 YNWA❤
Im tearing up. Im gutted.
Wow…Jurgen Klopp always seem to make decisions based on his feelings. He is doing the right thing by LFC. So truthful and transparent. I hope the next manager can follow the example set by Jurgen Klopp as a man and as a manager. I admire and respect him so so much for coming out to say he won’t coach any other EPL team except LFC. Jurgen Klopp to be the next German National Coach??? YNWA
I became a Liverpool fan after your arrival...and now you are going....we are definitely gonna miss you 😢
We will remember you so much ❤😢
Great fella and manager. Respect to his wishes to leave.
You can see he is shattered YNWA.  He needs time to be a man time catches us all at one point I take my hat off to him ❤
This just ruined my fking year and it's only just started
YNWA Kloppo ❤
Lets just stop and recognise how lucky we have been to live through these times. We will be telling our grand kids about Jurgen Klopp
😢😢❤
I was born in 1990, the last year Liverpool won the league. I have supported them my whole life. While we won trophies here and there, the league was always out of reach. There were times where I thought I was cursed, will I ever see my club win the league? I wanted nothing more than for Liverpool to win the league. You don’t know much much the league win in 2020 meant to me. Thank you Jurgen for everything you’ve done. You are the best thing to happen to my club 🥹🥹🥹
Heartbreaking 😢
it's hard to believe! One day we already knew that you would leave this club but couldn't believe you'd leave as soon. our heart will always be with you Jurgen. you'll never walk alone!
ผมแฟนลิเวอร์พูลจากประเทศไทย. รู้สึกเสียใจที่ได้เห็นคลิปนี้ แต่ผมก็เคราพการตัดสินใจของคุณ. ที่ประเทศไทยเรียกคุณ(คล๊อปป์)ว่า "บอส", บอส คุณจะเป็นตำนานของเราเดอะค็อปและสโมรสแห่งนี้ตลอดไป. . YNWA❤
I am a huge Milan supporter and Liverpool in particular have been a good opponent through the years. There is something special about the club. Like my club. I would love to see Klopp manage Milan after his break. I think it would be a good fit. Same passion from the fans and the history of the club is almost unmatched.
A well earned rest for the boss. There will be a gaping Klopp-shaped hole but it had to be done, and I'm grateful it's by his own hand. We are Liverpool and we are stronger because of his efforts over the years. Thank you and YNWA ♥
No way!!!
Jurgen Klopp...  The "Loved" One.
Jurgen klopp you are the best of all ,will miss you so much
We need to get Xabi Alonso or the Brighton manager
YNWA ❤❤ BUILD HIS STATUE
This hurts, love you klopp thanks for all the memories 🙏
Please if kloop leaves ,pep needs to stay😭🙏🏿 pep is the only one that can fit liverpool when kloop leaves. if they both leave us its over😢.  we need pep lindjers to stay or atleast try and get xabi alonso
Klopp you are a legend, you have won everything for us, its hard to accept that you will leave at he end of the season but at the same we will respect your decision. YNWA Jurgen!
It's the break up I never wanted to happen 😢
Thank you Jurgen for everything ❤⚽️🍻
😢
Thank you for everything you've done for this club! YNWA ❤❤
Give him the England job, only work part time then, and we get rid of that numpty Southgate.  yay
Treble is non negotiable!!!
Truly one of the greatest ❤️  It’s so sad but appreciate his farewell year. We will all miss you Boss  YNWA❤️
Người quản lý tuyệt vời cảm ơn ❤❤😢
I'm an arsenal fan, and even I am upset he is leaving. A great manager. I wish him well and his family.
Well.. that's "White January" done for me...
Klopp will always be a legend of the club and he deserves to do whatever he wants to do and I will support him in that.  But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t devastated at this news.   YNWA
One of a kind! A genius footballing brain and absolute gentleman. I have loved every minute of this man as Liverpool's manager. Good luck in the future Klopp and thank you for making Liverpool fans believe again.
One of the greatest managers ever. Will miss you 😢. Liverpool shall win this all cups this year for respect for you. We will all miss you😢😢😢
Bro, i think he is the best of the best ❤ always a Liverpool fan
You make my dream come true after 30 years of waiting.  I wish you the best and we will cheer the lung out til the end of season!
U are the man Jurgen! You will never walk alone
Thank you Jurgen from the bottom of my heart. U have taken our club which was a mid table team and made us believe again, fighting for everything every season. Every player and every fan would give everything for the badge and you have played such a huge factor in that happening. Thank you ❤
Listening to this interview. I can understand where he's coming from. But it's hard to accept. YNWA ❤
Could United be in Klopp’s immediate future? 🤔
Noooooooooo
Danke klopp
He has been INCREDIBLE. Huge thanks to him for everything that he has brought to the club - he's been absolutely transformative - but completely understand how much a job like that demands of someone.
No matter what team you support, this is sad. The Prem is losing a great manager
( Everton fan ) Wow! I was shocked to hear this to be honest he's done a great job since he arrived, but if you are leaving then it's best leaving when you are at the top. Good luck Jurgen.
Nooo. The next manager will have a big boot to fill. The manager is probably the most important position in any clubs 😢
No wonder, I can’t imagine how stressful it would be being in that position. Never ending stream of the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Good luck to Klopp, what a journey it’s been!
We love you Klopp, will never forget the joy you brought us ….
You achieved everything klopp Good luck for future.
He's the one who made me fall in love with Liverpool... I hope he can go out with a trophy cause he deserves it
A sad day for all Liverpool supporters. I will look back on his days with the club fondly. Klopp brought the club a long way from where we were when he joined. YNWA!
I found liverpool and Jurgen Klopp during a tough time in my life. He and the team gave me most of the power and hope to go on in life till now.  I can not imagine seeing a football match without him at the technical area with a stunned look on his face sometimes.  I would like to thank Jurgen Klopp from the bottom of my heart. We all would like to have a father like Jurgen.  # Heavy Metal Football # made me cry many times.  I think I am going to cry now a little bit, as if I didn't already have many reasons to do so.  I dont know if some of you can feel an emptiness; I feel depressed, like I lost a loved one. That's funny because the man is alive and he might manage another team some day.  Klopp should have won at least half the trophies that Pep got. But What Klopp has is US. Like me, who now is crying while typing this. It was hard enough to go through each day.  To the Mods: I couldn't help it with this one. I am sorry if this is violating guidelines or is a shitpost.  I just cant believe it still !
You will never be missed because you are Always With Us.YNWA
YNWA
He deserves a statue in Anfield!
I will never love another manager.  This feels like a divorce to me 😭😭😭
Love you Kloppo. 40 years a Liverpool supporter and hand on heart, you’ve been the best. Absolutely gutted to hear this but I understand. Thank you for 8 wonderful years so far, hopefully this last one is the best. 🙏 Good luck boss. ❤
So sad for us… but so happy for him YNWA❤
Na Jurgen youre getting the proof the only time I disagree with this great man. ❤ YNWA
I have been a Liverpool fan since a long time ago and nothing hurts such lik3 this😢
A million thank yous Jurgen. You're an absolute unit! We love you. Wish you the very best!! ❤
Honestly I'm sad after seeing this news. But I respect him. Probably from all he said, he reached his limit, he's burnout.  But look at positive side. We could get Xabi Alonso or nagelsmann.
a day i knew would come but hope wouldnt happen. Klopp changed the club so much and his influence will continue for years to come. what a man, what a manager, and what a journey he took us all on. now we can celebrate him and what do did for us for the rest of the season and until we meet again.
Definitely something happened and probably its the owners not supporting him financially...he said he doesn't have energy to work his magic anymore under tigh budget..
Quitter 😡🤬
What a way to go. The best ! Imagine seeing Klopp sacked one day
YANITED YANITED
I promised myself to not cry, I quickly failed.  Bring him a statue and his name for one of Anfield's stands. Thanks for everything, you were the Liverpool man, a true Scouse and you changed this club forever.  YNWA ❤
Als Dortmundfan wäre mein Wunsch klar, aber nicht realistisch! Er wird deutscher Nationaltrainer!
Not my club but I have nothing but respect for this man! Amazing manager and person.
Oh gosh, this is heartbreaking.. It least till 2026..?tried, yeah I believe he does.. But makes sure he doesn't  manage any national team or club, if not the fans wud really remember this statement and applied it towards him.. Anyways hope for the best him.. As for our club, I though Xabi Alonso wud be prefect, but he's currently doing well in bundesliga.. But still he cannot announce it yet, not in the second half of the season where we are challenging.. That wud demoralised the team and staff eventually.. Sighh klopp klopp
Xabi Alonso is the only manager the fans would want to replace him now
Don't know if I'll ever move on from this. Thankyou Jurgen for everything. 🙏😔
A legend of a manager, thank you Klopp. Now get the job done and win everything for the finale. YNWA RIP97
Noooooooo！
🥲🥲🥲. Dear Klopp! You'll never walk alone! 🥲🥹
The best manager is the world ❤
Wow... big shoes to fill.
💔
Damn, that's a farewell to any success to this club.
Noooo - this is the worst news ever
End of the legendary era. Guess I'll be watching a lot of Salah Mane Firminio highlights today. YNWA Jurgen
Thank you Mr Klopp ❤
He's rare😥... I was talking to my brother this morning and when I saw this news I immediately said to him will this change salah's mind over his contract Now... no man can replace klopp ... he's just rare
I feel totally lost, I love this man. My son is in tears. Absolutely love Jurgen 😢
I doubt if he stated the actual reasons of his leaving 😢  Bad timing for this annoucement....
Sad news. Players will look elsewhere, starters could be dropped. I'm just not seeing anything positive in this. Really really sad.
Danke Jurgen ❤❤❤
To be honest I'm very concerned for Liverpool now, we had a real issue attracting top players to the club without Klopp. He is literally irreplaceable.
Heartbreaking💔😭
Danke Jurgen Klopp
Thanks and good luck in all your future endeavours. YNWA
I'm so afraid of after klop 😢
😭😭😭
😭😭😭
Thank you Jurgen Klopp, Gonna miss you for sure but good time doesn't last forever but good memories will always stay with us Liverpool fans. You'll Never Walk Alone 🫡
Damn. Klopp will always be in our hearts. All the kloppout hatters have got nothing to say now.  😢 who is going fill his boots? Danke Klopp.YNWA  23:28 Well said !
Thank you Jürgen, you've brought the club, the fans, the city and everyone somehow involved so many unforgettable moments. Your passion for football and the reds is outstanding and YNWA  Once again, Thank you❤
His days have been numbered for a while now. It’s about time for someone fresh. His football’s just not working anymore and he’s clearly bored with the crop of players he has. Good riddance I say.
😭
This man deserves an unforgettable goodbye at the end of the season and the Anfield will do it the best way. ❤
In Klopp we trust!! Respect the man's integrity and honesty and all the on field success he has given us. Thanks Jürgen. ❤
Heart broke news
Дядя Юра... Спасибо... Спасибо за эти прекрасные 8 лет... Спасибо что вернул Ливерпуль на вершину не только Английского, но и мирового футбола. Спасибо за эмоции которые я пережил. Спасибо за моменты радости. Спасибо за все... Желаю удачи и успехов на новом месте, куда бы ты не пошел. Знай, мы, фанаты Ливерпуля никогда тебя не забудем, всегда будем тебе рады, и всегда будем благодарны тебе... Ещё раз, спасибо YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE
😭😭😭
Best coach after anchelotti
Will be absolutely missed, to not watch his reaction on the side line will be shocking. Hopefully he will return many times so fan can feel the butterflys in the stomach each time camera show him. And hopefully Xabi build even higher after Mr Klopp.
The whole English premiere league has so much to thank this man for
I have no words to describe how much that man means to me thank you so much for the memories you will always be a red ♥️
MY Gaffer, such an inspiration to everyone. Even once you leave, we will always be behind you. YNWA
Nothing else to say but a massive thank you. Truly appreciate you Boss. 😊
Thank you Klopp❤
HiS coming to UNITED haha  On all seriousness, is KLOPP OK. This is a sad day for FOOTBALL. hurts me to say but he was my favourite MANAGER.
So 2 LEGENDS LEAVING AT SAME TIME? KLOP & SALAH😮😢

Thanks for everything, Jürgen. Absolute legend. When does the statue construction start?

Absolutely shattered, but wishing him the best for his future endeavors. Cannot thank him enough for being the guiding light to our beloved club. He will always be a legend and our savior, when we needed him the most. YNWA 🫡
BUILD THIS MAN THE BIGGEST STATUE AT THE KOP PLEASE.
So sad :( but I understand
Bester Mann.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
God bless you boss...YNWA...I watched this with tears in my eyes but that relief and calm in your voice convinsed me it's the best thing for you...God be with you and the whole familly❤
I cannot imagine my life as a Liverpool supporter from now on.
This really hurts!
Worst possible news. We love you Jurgen Norbert Klopp. Your legacy will forever walk on.
this hits hard... i wasnt ready. tears
He will always be a red YNWA
I am already having such a bad week and day and now this? This one just took me out ☹️💔😭
i am sad but also deeply thankful thank you Jürgen and now lets finish this season properly :D
We love you gaffer, thank you for making our club successful again. YNWA!!
Welcome back, Xavi! 🤗❤
We need to win every trophy available for this man and build a statue outside Anfield😢❤❤. Thank you Jurgen Klopp❤❤
Even as an Arsenal fan, when this man signed for Liverpool, I knew it was a perfect match. His personality and character were a perfect fit for the Liverpool type of club.  The Premier League will definitely miss him. What a legend!
Thank you Jurgen 😢❤🔴
I've watched Klopp since dortmund days and I've always loved his character and the way he brings out the something unique in players. Like, his team building and passion he instills into others is absolutely inspiring. Thank you so much for your time in the premier league Klopp, you are a real gem of a human, not just a football manager.  West ham fan ❤️
Thank you sir for all the memories. Haven't shed tears since Stevie G left. I was a young kid back then but now this news even makes a grown man cry. Completely shocking. But YNWA❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Going to miss this man 😢😢😢 ynwa
Echoes of Shankly leaving in 1974. You've gave everything Jurgen. Let's finish on a massive high YNWA
Let's hope he wins the league to be able to celebrate properly with the fans unlike the pandemic title!! God I'm absolutely gutted😢
We'd better fucking win it for him, eh?
stop this, its not 1st of April, my heart can't handle this 😢
Welcome to Bayern München
A Momentous Statue NEEDS to be built  immediately of that man the Father Figure 🗽 💯 🙏 ..
Its nightmare 😢😢😢
From a United fan, even though you gave us a hard time in recent years, you will be remembered as one of the best managers of all time. I wish you all the best.
Jose Mourinho to Liverpool 😳
Guy is tired young!
Thank you Mr Jurgen Klopp.  The greatest manager I will ever seen in my lifetime supporting Liverpool. Thank you for restoring our club back to where we belong, at the top.  I've dreaded this news for years. Liverpool football club will never be the same without you.  YNWA
Very sad day 😢
Devastated 😢😢😢 always been anxious about this day. Thank you Jurgen for everything you have done. We love you ❤
Complete respect to our boss it’s been our honour let’s finish on a high
Love from myanmar. My Man ❤❤❤ klopp
Petition to rename the Kop to the KLOPP:
He could have left after a bad last season,  he stayed and with club transformed the team again so we can compete with the best. That's how good man he is, he prepared club for a new manager. That is how he loves Liverpool ❤
The Usain Bolt of football! Total Dominance!  We will miss you Sir
Phew!  Full respect to you, JK! Thank you for what you did for football. We will never forget you. Glad you're leaving in health.  On a lighter note... Chelsea now has a much better chance of dominating next season.  ❤ See you at Wembley... in both the Caraboa and FA cup finals.
King Klopp, you will be remembered forever. ❤❤❤❤
😢 today is a bad dark day. Will miss u so bad sir klopp
Thank you Jurgen for everything. You brought us out of our rut. We are grateful for serving this club. God bless you
We always knew one day this incredible managers tenure would end. As quick as he breezed in now comes the time where he breezes out. Golden era and I’m sure I speak for all of us… Enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks for the memories Jürgen Norbert Klopp YNWA
I've been a Liverpool fan for 10 years now, and I've been with you for 8-9 years. All the fans love you legend, thank you for everything YNWA❤❤❤❤❤❤
You are Liverpool for me. I'm sure I will miss you after you leave, but until then, we will do our best to support your team! YNWA❤
I'm an Arsenal fan and this even made me sad. True gentleman and nothing but respect for the man. He has brought so much to English football. Every single fan should thank him.
It would’ve been preferable for Jürgen Klopp to leave at the end of next season to get a second chance to win the Champions League but knowing he said a while back that he planned to take a break after 2022 season and the moment has finally arrived. Thank you for transforming Liverpool to what it is currently and for bringing an entertaining and a competitive edge to the Premier League. I hope you return sooner than later 🫡
❤
Premier league will definitely miss him!
YNWA <3
Im emotional. YNWA. Best manager Ive ever seen. The passion and love has been second to none.
I can fully understand his decision. Its draining being a supporter of this club at times so how must it be for Jurgen. Lots of pressure on him and eventually something has to give. Thank you Thank you Thank you Jurgen for everything, the memories the trophies the special nights and matches and lets hope for a few more. YNWA
❤️We are Liverpool ❤️
Best football news I've heard in ages as a utd fan but he is a Top class manager and will be a massive loss for Liverpool and the Premier league
We will miss you 😢Thank you for everything Klopp, YNWA ❤
Jesus! Fair enough he has a right to leave just funny how many players he signed to rebuild Liverpool. It looked like Liverpool were back as a force maybe he signed all those players to not leave the club in shambles, end on a high note and not a mess for the next manager that comes in. Legend!
I fully understand this decision. Klopp is doing the right thing. He is leaving on his own terms. Leaving us so much stronger than when he arrived. Now let's finish the season strong. Let's all get behind our manager and our team and bring home the quadruple!  Thank you so much for the amazing memories. We love you very much.   YNWA❤
Heard a rumour a few days ago.  Honestly thought it was just that.
Klopp is joking
Absolutely gutted! 😢
❤❤❤we love you kloop almost  a decade is a long time he has family so he has to change his life we love him im sick i hope you get every cup this season we will always love you
I hope the lads win the quadruple for him 😢
No wayyyy 😭 I love this man❤
Even if I want to I can't  accept your decision. Please rethink once, if you want a break please take it and come back.. But please please be with us. We love you.
Hes deffo going to Madrid i can smell it a mile away. FFS Jurgen.
He came in style, he performed in style, he leaves in style...      ...he will never walk alone...
No words can describe the impact this man has had on LFC and the premier league. Thank you Jurgen for everything. YNWA
I'm sick , because I know deep down we will fall off .
What a man, you will be truly missed and forever loved, YNWA
😢
COME TO FENERBAHÇE 💙💛
It is so bad news. I can not imagine this Liverpool without Jurgen. The club is more than any people, but this man is unusual.  When he signed last contract til 2026, I thought that he will resign new longer contract.  When he leaves, I hope we will get Alonso or another good manager.
Only xabi alonso can replace him
Every Premier League Official just breathed a huge sigh of relief
😭💔
Thank you for bringing happiness to my life jurgen YNWA ❤
Who's gonna be Darwizzy's mentor now? :(((
Heartbreaking 😢❤
Is Trent interviewing? YNWA Klopp, legend
Ah Jürgen, honestly you've been the best thing to happen to LFC for a long time.   We've all had hard dark days but you have given us hope and allowed us to walk on.  Through the wind or rain, you've been there.  An ultimate best friend that I'll probably never meet but I hope you and your family have happiness and good health.  YNWA.
I love this man with all my heart  Changed my club forever ynwa❤
This genuinely came out of nowhere but we support your decision no matter what YNWA Jurgen wherever you are
I am devastated
I feel like a kid his Dad is telling him he won't be home by summer. It's just a club but he is like our dad not just a manager
I am heartbroken
Is absolutely devastating that your leaving my wishes go out to your health I an praying for you ♥ thank you for all the great memories u have made
Please don't 😢😢😢😢
We call for Liverpool to build a statue for klopp YNWA😢😢
Build the statue
😢❤YNWA KLOPP
Come to barca 💙❤️
Respect your decision Jurgen, thank you for everything now let's get these trophies 🏆
Why suddenly???..just finish the contract 😢

24:20 🥲
Nooooooooooooo😂
WHAT THE HELL KLOPPY. Ok, thank you for the years....we will always love you
Love you forever Jurgen....sad to see you go. NOW LETS GET THIS TITLE!!
We love him. I am grateful for the time he was here, he changed the club's trajectory. YNWA
Pep’s broken him!!!!!
Naa, it's not the best time to announce this. Just wait till the end of the season.
The day is here😔😩…thank you for everything Klopp❤️🫶🏼 P.S. Suggest a good coach for us before going😅
Every man has two lives, and the second starts when he realises he has just one.  I know how you feel Jürgen we won't be here forever and we need time to ourselves without timetables and structure to really just go and enjoy our time here while we can ❤️ respect you you forever boss you may not live forever but you will be eternally engrained on Liverpool hearts❤️
😢
Arteta made it to hard for him
I can even watch the video after he said I’m leaving the club the end of season 😭😭😭😭
We will miss you Jurgen ❤❤❤ you'll always be a red my friend ❤❤❤
Nooooooo😭😭😭😭😭
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU ARE 😢 HE'S SUCH A CLASS ACT!! I'M NOT A LIVERPOOLFC FAN BUT THIS SUCKS FOR FOOTBALL 😢
As you said yourself Klopp from day one judge me when I leave.  What a job you have done for Liverpool FC and have left the club in a fantastic position, competing at the top.  You made me proud to be a fan again. Thanks for some beautiful memories! YNWA
Let's throw him the biggest ball in English history🎉
Danke Fur Alles, Jurgen
Football will never would be the same without Jurgen
Then guys who do you think should be our next manager...as Liverpool's and worlds one of the best coach is stepping down😥😥
Thank you! What a footprint you leave. My deepest respect. What a character and person. Thanks a million!
There is an end to everything. That's life. Thank you Mr Manager for the good times and memories since Oct 2015. Wish you all the best.
그동안 정말 고생하셨고 , 정말 리버풀에 대한 헌신 정말 너무 감사했습니다 . 앞으로 좋은 일만 있기를.. 정말 꼭 가야하시나요...ㅠㅠ YNWA
the only guy who could save ManU😂 This guy is a club changer!
Amazing manager from a city fan
One of the best that has blessed the Prem.   ~a chelsea fan
Absolute fair play to him for his honesty.  He has been unbelievable for Liverpool and we know our heroes. Good luck to him and whatever he decides to do in his long term future
Let’s go win it all for the best manager of my generation and give him the best send off last game of the season! Anfield best be bouncing for every game until the end of the season now
This makes me angry. Manchester City have cheated us out of more silverware and the best times with Jurgen. Relegate them!!
2024 is a really wild year man what the hell is happening. All the best Jurgen Klopp nothing but respect for this man.  He truly revolutionized Liverpool, with each and every season and it ended up with a lot of trophies and magical moments absolutely amazing displays from the former Dortmund coach.  He made Liverpool a genuine threat to my favourite club Manchester City just utterly amazing.  Thank you for the moments Mr. Jurgen just wow.  I hope he gets himself together mentally and gets a well deserved break maybe he may go to Dortmund again and helps them beat Bayern Munich and win a champions league idk man this is just shocking from Jurgen
Пздц …
How Klopp now😢
We knew this day will come but I still can't accept it. All the best klopp you'll never walk alone
He needn't worry about the fans reaction. I can't speak highly enough of him. Every minute he's been at the club he's been a lovable likable human being and its been refreshing to see. He's embedded his name in Liverpool history and I wish him all the best.  Go off and enjoy a year and realise who you are in this moment in your life. If you recharge your batteries and feel like you want to manage again. That's fine, you've given us everything. Literally the world even. Liverpool is better now  for having shared these years with you. Thank you, Jurgen Klopp, for everything and being the Normal one.
You will be forever remembered man...
the saddest day as a liverpool fan.
For man u fans this is the best day of their lives
Jurgen is the GOAT! Thanks for your hard work and dedication to the club. YNWA
At this point I want Liverpool to win the premier league, FA cup, Carabao Cup and the Europa league Klopp deserve it
You Sir, are the best signing we've had...
Please build this man a statue
What an amazing legend of a coach. The best to ever coach a club. We’ll always appreciate you thank you 🙏 😊
Nothing to say.  Just Thank you for everything and YNWA.  Let's hope our players just become bad out of a sudden like the BVB players when they left Dortmund or when he left himself.  Take a look at Coutinho or Mané. Only world class under Klopp.
Legend of manager
Please extend 1 last year. 😥😥😥😥😥
❤️
Arsenal fan here. Klopp is a legend of the PL and up there with the very best coaches the league has ever had. He will be missed
Gut punch
.... for me this is by far the worst and saddest news since I've been an LFC fan, you can only cry 😭
I'm 31 y.o. grown man, it's 19th minute, tears doesn't stop running down😭
💔😭
I love Jurgen Klopp❤ YNWA❤
ohh... its really sad to hear Klopp leaving ... ill miss him....  wish we lift more trophies with him ...
I feel like I've just been kicked in the guts. I knew this day would come but it's still a shock. Thank you for everything you have done Jürgen. God bless you.
100% respect this man and his decision. YNWA  - He needs time out, the pressure must be intense and we as humans just need a break......  KLOPP!!!!!!!!! Legend!!!!!
Jurgen Klopp will always be Liverpool. He gave us as supporters hope and the club. We love and support you Klopp❤❤🎉

Nothing but respect for you Jurgen. After listening to your reasons I fully understand. You have changed my life as a Liverpool fan. Some of the best nights of my life, for that I am eternally grateful.   Thank you Jurgen Y.N.W.A ❤
Hopefully Klopp is our modern day Shankly and we follow up with a modern day Paisley and go on to win everything for a decade.
Next England manager
YNWA
Thank you for the memories
Thank you. I will always remember emotions your team gave me. You will never walk alone
my heart just broke. Together with Shanks and Bob he is the best there ever was at LFC. Kloppo, you are a living legend, I cannot put into words what you did for the club,. the people and the city.
😮😮😮😮🤯
🥺🫶
please dont leave.
saddest day in the recent history of Liverpool 🥲
I am so GLAD. YNWA ❤️
1 title in 9 seasons. Alex, wenger, pep, mourinho >> klopp. All are better premier league legends
I respect his decision and appreciate all he did for Liverpool wish him all the best ❤❤❤
😭😭😭😭
YNWA
Nothing last forever,we knew this day will come and all we can say is thank you so much for all the good memories. Greatest of all time,many tried and couldn't achieve what you have
❤❤❤ Always And Forever Master Klopp, You Will Never Walk Alone
Thank you Klopp for everything ❤️
We back you Jurgen... It hurts. But we back you❤
I grew up during the golden era of Liverpool on 1980's. Without you, Boss, I didn't know when Liverpool would win the league trophy again. So far, you were the last jigsaw behind all success of the club on this modern day. I've never seen any manager who could fit well to Liverpool FC like you. Cheer up players, cheer up fans, be part of all the games   Really don't want you to leave but respect to your decision. I'll be missing you. Thank you, Boss. YNWA!!!
I'm not ready 😮
I was waiting for him to say this is a prank😢😢
❤❤❤❤คล็อป์ป  love klopp
Watching this, gets 😔💔
Only people who are happy about jurgen slopp leaving liike this
Noooooooooooooo
We love you so much  And we accept you and your decisions  I am definitely going to miss you so much ❤❤❤ You definitely have a spot in my heart and I'm going to cherish that ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow, this is absolutely heartbreaking. His Liverpool 2.0 is in full swing... Probably back in the UCL next season too... Why now 😢😢😢
‪I understand his decision and I appreciate the fact that he’s telling us now…..but it still hurts. All the best to him though. He deserves every bit of happiness and respect in the world. ‬ ‪❤️YNWA❤️ Danke, Jürgen‬
Im genuinely crying 😭
When did our gaffer decide this tragic news oh my God😢
Legend
No way. Thank you for everything please bring us a few more trophies before you move  on. All the best. Let’s pray we get Alonso now !
See you in 3 months when we actually know the truth
Devastated. Thanks for everything Jurgen. Lets win everything this season for the gaffer. YNWA.
Good luck Jurgen!! You will always be a legend of the club! Thank you for everything and good luck :)
클롭 감독님 그동안 감사했어요 ㅜㅡㅜ 너무 너무 아쉽네요 감독님과 이별을 해야한다니 ㅜㅜ
He’s been here for eight years and he’s transformed this club into a masterpiece. He will always be a legend ❤️
Whatta a manager This guy transformed Liverpool and won them every possible trophy  The premier league will miss you  Danke jurgen ❤
😭YNWA Jurgen ❤
Thank you for everything Boss❤
Future German National Team Manager?
Jurgen you leave with our love, respect, admiration and gratitude for everything you have done.
Jürgen is and has been a fantastic ambassador for this club. He's not just an amazing coach but a great human being and the kind of father figure I think we all wish to have. This is heartbreak, but that is beautiful in itself because it shows how much he means to us fans as well.   Take care of yourself Jürgen, you are my all time favorite manager and an inspiration in my own life. You will never be forgotten, YNWA and let's do our very best to make your last season something you will cherish!
Come to Besiktas 🔥
Enjoy the rest of the season 'cause come the Summer you're going right back to where you belong, mid table for the next 30 years with Conference League football if you're lucky. Salah won't be long behind him so it's all downhill from here.  Bye! 👋😂
I feel like I’ve been shot in the chest
He leaves the club in a far better state as when he came in - whoever follows will have "tremendously huge boots to fill". But ending it in this matter is Klopp through and through. Like a boss - but one that gives the club the necessary time to (hopefully) make the next "perfect" decision for the future. All the best for your future Mr. Klopp / best wishes from your place of birth.
I wish you all the best we are all going to miss you this man deserves a statue he goes down one of the greatest managers of all time.   Thank you Jurgen Klopp YNWA. ❤️
I really can't like this video my god.
💔😭😭
one of the true legends of the clubs managerial history...
I’m devastated. I can’t put into words how much I admire and respect Juergen for the person he is, what he accomplished and all he has done for Liverpool fans.  He will be missed but he has earned the right to go on his terms with the blessings of all of us.
The ONLY ACCEPTABLE REPLACEMENT IS XABI ALONSO. I am so so sad, but we must make a monster move for him asap
Make it 10 years please, after that maybe Xabi will fit to us
Sad :(
They could have replaced any  players.. and I would tell anyone we have Klopp. Now we are about to lose him?!
This is really heartbreaking 💔💔💔
Never felt so heart broken but I care about the coach's mental health and happiness more than the club success. He achieved everything he could with the means he had. Thank you for everything Boss YNWA. You deserve a break after making the dreams of the club come true
There will never be another Manager like Jurgen Klopp❤ Build the man a statue. He has single-handedly transformed the club.
thank you for everything Jürgen. you made Liverpool FC a force to be reckoned with once again. You'll Never Walk Alone
Let's win the league for this incredible individual and give him a great send-off. I'm in bits after this news. I hope everything is fine with him and his family, because this was out of the blue. The end of this season is going to be a tough one. YNWA!
Get started on a statue… and get started on getting xabi Alonso!!
What a journey it's been so far! I look forward to experiencing the final chapters. Sad to hear this news but I have nothing but respect and a mountain of appreciation for the memories Klopp has been a massive part of. YNWA
i wish this is the best AI they make
An absolute shock. A monumental effort to get Liverpool winning and challenging for trophies again after all those years of pain and disappointment. We'll definitely miss him but hopefully we send him off with what he deserves, some trophies, love and respect. Danke gaffer, YNWA.
Thank you for everything you have done King Klopp 👑 Health is way more important than football 🙏🏽
I FEEL HOME,THATS ALL. LIVERPOOL IS A REAL FAMILY💕💕👏💕
You'll never walk alone ❤
If they would have given him a bigger budget, wouldn't be leaving
From doubters to believers, Thankyou Jurgen for everything YNWA ❤
I am in shock I wish he would have stayed until he was eligible for he's pension 😢 I love Jurgen best manager in the world
YNWA klopp you are the reason i support liverpool and will miss your presence in the club😭😭❤️❤️❤️goodbye
xabi alonso to Liverpool here we go
As a United fan it’s incredible what he’s achieved with one arm behind his back against a backdrop of Pep cherry picking whatever he wants
lets hope we can part ways in the best way possible and make this season a very successful one! Im also hoping we got a replacement ready, ideally Alonso, hopefully they go and get him he would be perfect, thats the one thing I feel like makes this whole bombshell sensical, to go and get Alonso now before he is taken by somebody else and start the new process under him ASAP, but its still some time away so lets enjoy this period to the maximum!
Absolutely gutted gave me the best 9 years of memories I have as a Liverpool fan. He has done so much for the club and deserves all the respect and admiration he’ll receive
It's devastating!!!
As they say thankyou for your service❤
I’m a newcastle supporter and I want to say thank you to Klopp for what he did for Liverpool and Premier League. What a manager and what a person! Be proud!
I'll take a break from football too
Greatest Liverpool Manager, no, greatest manager I’ve seen in my lifetime.  Thank you Jurgen.
The king is dead long live the king xabi Alonso
Thank you for all of the wonderful memories, herr Klopp! Anfield will never forget the wonderful football we've seen you and the players created!
Love you Jurgen and YNWA absolutely gutted but nothing lasts forever 💔
I cried a little reading the interview and am crying much more watching this. I became a liverpool fan when we beat city in ucl after watching premier league for a year or two and I am so sad and devastated to hear this. I am ashamed I did not travel from alaska to watch a game at anfield while he was still at the helm. Thank you Jurgen it is slightly embarrassing how much you've affected my life from such a distance I can only hope I meet the man irl and get a bear hug from the one and only gaffer one day
Lets win a last title for Klopp.
Thank you for everything, Jürgen It is no overstatement to say you are the reason I fell in love with this sport and this club
Build the man a statue. He has single-handedly transformed the club. There will never be another Manager like Jurgen Klopp❤
Thank you Jürgen. You made the people happy.
Thank you for everything, every memories, every smile you've bought on all our faces Klopp. You're forever a red.. YNWA ❤️
Thank you Klopp.we´ll always remember you as our greatest coach from the 21st century
😢Just ❤Thank you Jurgen❤😢
What a guy!!! As a LFC fan... i can only say the last 8 years with him has been the single best managerial job i have ever seen. 🫡Thankyou Jürgen Klopp... YNWA🔴🔴🔴
just stop I'm crying
The most charismatic manager in history ❤
Klopp to the club "if you bring camera into the dressing room he will go" and now we are getting a documentary smh fuckkkkkkkkkl!!!!!!
Goodbye Klopp. Benitez was better.
I never thought this day would come. You have been a class act you came in when we were in turmoil and lost a great team we did not know what to do after suarez but you showed us football from day1  you are Liverpool forever i will never forget the greatest manager i believe in your football and you! To all those african coachs “senegal and egypt who took his words out of context. You lacked respect for the greatest most kind manager shame on you for making this narrative. He is a great man and will live on in Liverpool hearts forever!!! To all the Liverpool fans who complain about his team selection just remember he is jurgen kloop Liverpool manager and those fans are new fake toxic fans please go support real madrid or barcelona we don’t need you !!!!
Easily the greatest Liverpool manager in my lifetime, gave us so many moments that I will always look back to, these players already fight every game for this man. Let's end it on a high
Noooo😢
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Very gutted but thanks for everything you've done for us one last season
Love the man, moving on. Please, please, please give the job to Pep
I am not sure whether I should like this video or not. I am still feeling shocked and devastated as I expected this to happen in another 2 seasons, but not now. Anyway, all the best to our legend in your next journey. 😢
Thank you Jürgen Klopp  for everything you done and I will never forget the great journey we had  as fans with you. YNWA❤
Pep lijnders or Xabi Alonso next. We won't go into how much of a loss this is. I thought atleast another two seasons with the new team.
Simply a LEGEND! How down to earth this man is truly unbelievable! Thank you for everything!  YNWA ❤❤
Liverpool legend we can all agree and has brought us all an amazing journey and winning everything there is thank you klopp for everything
As a United fan, coming to the Liverpool channel just to comment on what this man has done, he is one of the best manager in football history I was shocked that klopp made this decision I am not even sure to celebrate that United are not gonna get bantered by Liverpool or to be sad that this legend is leaving this club 😕
What a manager. What a legend. It's a tough one to take but, We're Liverpool, this means more!
Its nothing but respect to Urgen, good luck in new projects
thank you jurgen, please come back no matter  how old you are. thank you thank you and you are worth of statue inside Anfield
Legend 😢
What a leaving present it would be for the fans if he can deliver the premier league again 👍
I’m absolutely gutted to hear your stepping down, thank you for everything you have done for our club! We love you jurgen, wish you the absolute best in your future endeavours! This man deserves a statue the absolute history he has written for this club! YNWA
Klopp, please don't do this....please ...don't make me cry
Outstanding Humility
Wow. An era has come to an end... I don't even know which manager would be good enough to fill his shoes.
Absolutely heartbroken seeing this, but it takes a big person to leave their position on their own terms. Klopp revamped this club and made us all believe again. Build him a statue outside Anfield!
tough one💔. But thanks for the great memories you gave us sir!  YNWA ❤
YNWA Jurgen!! ❤️🥛
I hope the staff stay. Upheaval will occur if Pep, Peter, Victor, Mona and all the background staff also leave.
Thanks Klopp. Legend❤
😢😢😢 we will miss you
I'm so glad that Jurgen is a red.  I'm so glad he delivered what he said.  Jurgen said to me you know we'll win the Premier league you know he said so.  I'm in love with him and I feel fine.  ❤️YNWA JURGEN❤️
Can’t believe the day will finally gonna happen . But why so soon 😢. Forever a legend.
Legend. Already.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Don't know how to react to this 💔
Biggest Legend Liverpool❤
A very sad day but Liverpool football club have dealt with many mangers and players leaving the club and Liverpool football club carry on walking on YNWA
My mate works in catering at united and apparently he’s gonna take over there. BIG NEWS!!!
I love you jurgen thank you❤
It's better you leave, Klopp. You are blind lately. You choose the old van dijk as a captain is your mistake. Van Bik Dik is in fact very slow and lazy now, then you don't have any strenght to kick him out. You better to leave now before evrything getting worse.
Don't push Klopp and all team  to much.. keep it goin ..
Klopp ❤ YNWA
As FC Bayern München fan, I want to say that this man has managed to rebuild Liverpool from downs to a club that could win Champions League title. I'm sure he is loved by fans around the world, not only Liverpool fans but those who love football, and he will remain to be loved for long time. Simply a legend. If I want to use Liverpool's motto, it's "He will never walk alone". Liverpool will always be his "Mia San Mia". Good luck in the future, Klopp! 😎
Thank you Jurgen for everything. All our lives were made much better because of you.
I'm literally crying bro. This can't be, not now. I knew this time will come, but this came from nowhere. It's like having a long term partner saying he is not happy with you anymore and wants to move. I'm shaking, but at the same time I'm super grateful for this man. He changed our club, our identity- he deserses a statue infront of Anfield. One of the greatest football managers, hope he gets his needed rest and be ready to take on Germany. YNWA Jurgen, we love you
as Arsenal fan can say that this man is an unbelievable coach and deserves only respect.
Nooooo please Jurgen 😢😢😢😢😢
What a sad, sad day for all of us liverpool supporters, thankyou for what you gave to us❤ YNWA
We love u boss
Don't let this man leave, he's one of the main reasons the premier league is the most competitive league.
I saw this coming it was just a matter of time...but was holding out for 2025 for him to go! Thank you Klopp im such a huge fan from New Zealand 🇳🇿🇨🇰👍❤️ thank u thank u!  LFC 4 eva👏
A very miserable news for Liverpool fans, nonetheless thank you for everything
This is foggin wild. We love you Klopp thank you for everything you have done and the work you put in. In 100years people will still talk about you!  YWNA❤❤
Is it just me or is his ankle really swollen
No way
Whattt, Really? 😭😭
As a Sheffield Wednesday fan klopp as done brilliant at Liverpool he’s top class and he’s made Liverpool into an incredible young team n they will win trophies with or without klopp
So much respect for this man! You never walk alone Klopp ❤ let’s give this man the greatest last season ever!
Bill Shankly, Kenny Dalglish - all over again
NOOO😢😢😢😭😭😭
Thank you for everything Jurgen. We love you a lot and as a Liverpool South African fan : I am so incredibly proud to have had you as our manager. You made us the envy of the football world and gave me the best days as a Liverpool supporter. With tears in my eyes : Danke Jurgen. We will truly miss you but forever remain grateful for what you have done..
Thanks for everything gaffer
When klopp signed for lfc it was one of the best days of my life and this interviews has got to be one of the worst
We will miss you Jurgen, 💔. You will always be in our hearts. Thank you, Thanks  to Pep as well as the management. You have transformed fully the team, led us to glory once again. 🤝🏼
Devastated, but what a human Jürgen is.  The club and supporters owe this man so much.  YNWA.
We love you Klopp
The Feeling tho...😢😢😢
Bro tell me this is a joke please
Love Klopp❤ but i think that's not all to expect. Salah'll likely be leaving, too, and hopefully, we get Xabi. Good luck to Germany though, next trophy for Klopp is the next world cup. Love Klopp❤ YNWA😢
Thank you for coming to those of us who are in endless despair  Thank you for giving us trust and walking on that path together  YNWA Klopp!
Fair play to the bloke.  Shanks knew when to go, Paisley and Kenny too.  Nothing but admiration for him as he picked the club up and transformed it.  The next manager will have massive shoes to fill.  I just hope they don't choose Stevie G.  He's a Liverpool legend but I don't think he's right for the role at this time.
devastated.... but im glad hes said it now... it will only be good for him now hes gotten it off his shoulders and the players can give their all to help him win as much as possible now...
I feel super heart broken! I think if given enough cash to sign whoever he wants to make his job easier, he will stay!
❤❤❤❤❤😢
Love u klopp. Thank you for making my club beautiful . Forever grateful ❤❤
Forever a Liverpool Legend❤
Thank you for everything Jurgen ❤
I couldn’t believe I could be this sad over football
There will be a whole in the heart of the club without this man 😢 you’ll never walk alone klopp
This man is a Liverpool legend this guy brought Liverpool back from the trenches thank you for everything klopp ❤️.
thank you jurgen. blessed to have experienced so many classic days and nights in the stadiums with you.
I just can't accept it, but 100% understand where he is coming from. Take a few years of and come back.
Cried when i saw this, love you jurgen forever
omg
YNWA
We all knew this would happen one day, he walked away from Dortmund to have a "normal life" fair play for doing it respectfully and giving the club time to react and keep moving forward. I wouldn't be surprised if a new boss has already been selected or targets narrowed down
no no no 💔💔
This man will be forever in our hearts for what he has done for our club on behalf of every liverpool fan we thank you for everything
You made me believe more than I could ever do. Thank you for everything 💔
No man, this can't be true. NO. NO NO NO
Wow this is very sad news 😭
YNWA Klopp.
FC Liverpool is always above them all, players, trainers, legends, people, fans, FC Liverpool is an institution but JESUS! Holy f***! What a shock!!! :(
You are a legend, boss❤
❤🤍❤
❤
We have loved having you as our Manager Jugen , YNWA .
Sad day im in shock that klopp is leaving 😢but understand & respect love this man what he has done for us is incredible and cant thank him enough klopp deserve a statue for what he has done ❤great man great manager hopefully we can give him best send off by winning league again for him  YNWA klopp Thank you ❤️for everything  all respect & love
Thank you for everything ❤
So gutted. Thank you for changing football. You and Pep have changed the way i watch football. I watch with enjoyment and excitement. Thank you. ❤
I cried so hard after hearing this because I was dreaming of Liverpool in the future with jurgen at the helm...with him going Liverpool will need total changes...
MOST OVERRATED MANAGER IN PL HISTORY 😂 1 LEAGUE TITLE IN 10 YEARS 😅
Why do I feel like there’s been a death in the family. YNWA Jurgen
Ну как так, Юра...... Это шок.
Someone tell me this is a nightmare. No, no, I couldn't accept it😢😢
💔💔💔
Gutted but i hope we go for Alonso
This is where the wheels come off the title bid.   Mind you, the wheels always come off in Liverpool.
Xabi alonso is the only man I will accept after klopp
Jurgen you're a hero and an absolute Liverpool legend ❤️ you will forever be in each and every Liverpool's fans heart forever . We can't express how much we love you
As United fan he is Liverpool's Ferguson,modern manager can't do what he have done for Liverpool
Well,didn't see that one coming!!Shocked to my core.Can understand his decision but devastated to hear this news.A tue Liverpool legend,brought so much to this club,will never be forgotten..Jurgen YNWA
Now if the players and him can somehow give him a send off of a league and maybe Europa league please
I feel completely lost without Klopp idk
Is it due to potential of All or Nothing like documentary type that going to take place?
That final game is gonna be BRUTAL.
Thank You For Jurgen Klopp. After Nine Years Practice For Liverpool FC (2015-2024).   Wish All The Best & Goodluck.
Thank you jurgen, please xabi alonso
Let finish strong this season. YNWA
Legend, best of luck Jürgen.
Klopp probably hopes to leave the club on a high. A quadruple at the end of the season? That would be a very nice send off...
Chef good bye we will miss you and the season 😢😢😢😢
I can't believe he's going 😭😭😭
Liverpool through and through. You found us at the bottom and took as above and beyond anything we could have dreamed for. You said we’d win the league and gave us the lot. Thank you Jürgen ❤ for everything!! And now let’s have a successful season and boss it!!
respect setinggi tingginya abangkuh menyala 3x
This was a heart breaker 😢
I am gutted absolutely.GREAT MAN!!❤❤❤ Much love

I just love his aura its unmatchable - From a Barca Fan 🤩. Nothing apart from respect & love for this man - Thank You Mr.Klopp 🙏 (my fav manager )
Thank you for everything gaffer. We can’t and never will be able to accept this but all the best to you, Legend! YNWA
Come to Barca klopp
We are going to win everything this season for Jurgen.
I'm in the wrong reality arent I
HEARTBROKEN VERY SADDD
“One thing I know for 100% is that I could never manage another club in England” the respect he has for the club I knew this day was coming I had a gut feeling he was gonna leave the end of this season. But I have a feeling xavi might come in..
Fantastic interview absolutely love Beithíoch
This was the right way to announce this. well done everyone. Of course we love Klopp and want him to do the right thing for him as he considers his decisions as the right thing for the club. The world is a better place with this man around.
Sad
😢😢😢
Thank You, you gave us so much. YNWA Jurgen
As a Chelsea fan... I'm now convinced Liverpool is going to win the season now lol... Yall can't let Klopp leave without winning it again
Please let Pep Ljinders take over I put my trust in him we love you Klopp
I was thinking last night while watching a post match interview with Rodgers that I cannot imagine a world where Jurgen is not our manager
Echoing the wisdom of George Washington who once remarked, 'I would rather be on my farm than be emperor of the world,' we recognize the humble yet profound leadership that has been the hallmark of your journey.   Thank you for making us believe again. You'll never walk alone, Klopp.
😭
Stop the world I want to get off 😢
Why 😢
So devastated man. What a time we've all had
ウソだと言ってほしい。ただただクロップが好きでした。ありがとう。絶対4冠しような👊  YNWA❤
Legend 🙏🏼
It was only last night that I got really emotional watching Klopp documentary on TAW and now he is leaving. Every club he has bin to he has left a massive positive imprint of him self. YNWA ❤
I was never ready for this 🥲😪💔
Where will he go?🥲
Always be remembered thanx for everything you’ve done for us a club legend YNWA Klopp
30 years watching the Arsenal and that man is the only rival manager which commanded 100% respect, the league will miss you skipper, hope you get everything going well and good for you again mate.
I wanna cry....
Was hoping this was some kind of clickbait, but alas....
What a man. What a legend.  I knew this day was coming but not this soon… my heart 💔

Heart Break 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Let’s win the four trophies we can for Jürgen, and finish the best way possible. Thank you Jürgen ❤
Gutted respect to klopp thinking of the club legend
As a Man City fan this is a shocking news. Klopp has been the best rival manager we could ever have, him and Pep made this league better than ever and this is not even an opinion, it's a fact. Different kinds of football but entertainment at its best. Genuine and pure rivalry. We will all miss you Jurgen, this is a sad day for English football and I can only imagine what it means for Liverpool fans. Respect ❤🤝💙
Legend ❤
Faaaaaaaakkkkkkk
I have no purpose anymore. I'm lost. I will still support Liverpool and Klopp.
This is the worst 60th birthday I could have expected to have heard 😭YNWA ♥️
Sign Xabi Alonso now.
my first heartbreak bruh kloppo :(
Thank you for everything, Jürgen ❤️
Iconic Manager, all the best Jurgen!
Y.N.W.A I can never thank you enough for what you've done and achieved and mostly restored to this club totally respecting your decision godbless take care stay safe xhugsx to Jurgen and ula godbless ❤

Lets win it all to end this era. Lets goooooo
Forever changed this club, forever a legend. Thank you for all you have done.  YNWA
I'm keep scrolling twitter to see this is just a prank or some promotion. Day ruined
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Absolutely gutted but if any manager deserves a rest its him. Watching football really won't feel the same without him ❤
I'm shocked, and this has almost brought me to tears, even when life gets bad watching my football team at least has brought me happiness and this man is a big reason why. Ynwa
Ooh Nooo 😢😢
Absolutely devastated, but we can't thank you enough Jurgen.  YNWA
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hope we win the league this season and give him the perfect send off open top bus celebration he deserves
Don't even know what to say. This weekend will be filled with crying. It feels so early even tho it's been this long😫Thanks for everything J.Klopp you are one of the best, iconic manager in this sport. YNWA♥♥
Very sad .   There is no manager to replace klopp . Can we trust the owners to get a replacement where with the current squad can continue to punch above its weight class.     Who's next then ?    Alonso ?    Not Gerrard 😮😮
Heartfelt farewell to a game-changing asset in the Premier League. 🌟 Your impact will be missed.
If teacher klopp leaves liverpool is the is end 💯
Not a great thing to admit at this stage of the season ...
YNWA J.K ❤️💔❤️
I am just gonna cry in silence
The normal one To legend Thank you
Is there any doubt why his players work so hard for him?  He can even coach the fans better than anyone!!! ❤ YNWA ❤
Our legend👏👏👏👏👏 your last day will be our 😭😭😭😭😭😭 crying day
I was not ready for this🙆🏾‍♂️, but burnout is real so I understand. He has done so much for us, wishing him all the best.
Irreplaceable ❤
You are important to all of us even if you won't say it, we will. YNWA. Once a red always a red. Good luck Sir Jurgen
My heart just broken listening to this news😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
World class manager and an even better man. All the best from a United fan ❤
I love you klopp
Move him upstairs to the Board or Technical Director... We still need him at the club in some capacity. 😢
the hardest thing in the life of new menager is to replace Jurgen❤️ klopp in all the ways Xabi Alonso is next 💪💪
I absolutely respect his decision and even in this moment, he is clearly thinking about the club. The best manager, right to the end. And with the team he has created, this might spur us on even more!! Absolute legendary bossman!!! You’ll be missed but we'll always love you!!
💔
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Very heart-breaking news for all the true lfc supporters. But at the end of Day its his decision and we respect that. He will always be one of the legend in LFC history. We all love you Klopp ❤❤❤❤❤
"This is the end... my only friend the end"
No matter who comes in, Jurgen can never be replaced😭
I can't believe Klopp wants to leave the club..
😢
Thank you Jürgen, You made every liverpool supporters believe again, you made us stronger than ever. ❤
Real madrid
give him a different role at the club!!!
The absolute best signing for Liverpool!! Thank you Klopp for everything ❤❤❤
The absolute LEGEND.... they need to rename The Kop to "The KLOPP"
Take a bow klopp 👊 honour this man with a statue.
Get xabi
We need to get the boys over the line and win the title, so we can have a proper party at the end of the season to say goodbye to Klopp.
Bring us PL trophies while you still our manager.
❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Absolutely heartbreaking. Thank you Jurgen Klopp. Your service to our club will last as long as this club does. In Klopp we trust. YNWA ❤
😭
NO! NO GOD PLEASE NO! 😢
Klopp can go to MC or Chelsea or NC which is a rich club and can buy expensive good players as he likes!
klopp 😭😭😭
YNWA 😢
Admin... April fool is few months away. Stop this
Haven't felt like this since the day the great Shanks left. Thanks for all the great memories Mr Klopp
Sad but please convince  pep linders  to take over for a seamless transition 🙏
As much as i dislike his behaviour at times i hope he returns to the epl at some point
The last dance is on.
I will follow him anywhere and support who he manages unless it’s a prem team as will always be a die hard red YNWA
😭
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
They already have his replacement, no need to go outside
You must stay till retirement,JK please don't give us broken 💔 ooo 😭😭
Xabi Alonso
I had to stop working, i'm literally crying my eyes out. YNWA Jurgen! We love you forever! Hope one day you'll come back and lead us to Champions League title again!
Absolute legend, thank you for everything! YNWA <3
Thank you for everything you have done and will continue to do for Liverpool. You will always be a part of Liverpool. Maybe become a Non Executive Director of Football. You'll Never Walk Alone Jurgen. ❤
GUTTED!
Let’s win the league for our legend Klopp
Absolute joke announcement doing that to the team half way through the season
From an Aston Villa fan, good riddance and please appoint Gerrard next.
Not  pool fan but a Klopp fan its heartbreaking to see a great coach like him go transformed Liverpool so much even won a Champions league before pep the man is decent and great cheers good luck in future endeavors
Get in
YOU"LL NEVER WALK ALONE
Thanks boss. Thank you for reigniting the fire within LFC. Beyond devastated but understand. Therebwill never be another like you.
this has broken me in so many ways i cant even speak of
I can't bring myself to give this video a thumbs up, but what a great man Jurgen Klopp is. As an armchair Liverpool fan I can certainly say having him at Liverpool and in England as a whole has been a massively positive thing and I hope he's sucessful and happy in whatever he does next.  YNWA.
OMG.
Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!!!!!
Damn... I'm not a liverpool fans but this is absolutely heartbreaking... truly   Good luck for your new journeys !
Dreaded this day. Let’s enjoy the rest of this season while he’s still here.
Massive fan, please come to Barcelona . We need someone like him desperately
He must be sick. Doesn't look that well ...
What a legend klopp you turned our club great again and thank you for that . Now go out with a bang and clean up would be great 🎉❤
As a Utd fan this guy deserves all the extravagance for his farewell
Devastated. Feels like my marriage has ended. But this man deserves everything. He has given so so much to the club, transformed us, and given the fans so much joy. Thanks Jurgen. YNWA.
Totally respect how he feels. He explains a lot of how this has come about and more than he would be expected to or we have the right to. Will miss him. Class act from start to finish.  Had to get it off his chest to be relieved and finish the season. That's how much it was weighing on him that he might upset people.  Absolute best sort of manager you can have.
Thank you klopp wish you  all the best fantastic efforts and your transparency and drive is second to none
Good decision to mention it that early. Now, we can enjoy the rest of the ride even more!  This guy brought me to the football! Tanks, mate!
Xabi alonso to liverpool...i am 100% sure...Even Fabrizio cant deny this...breaking news
We truly accept it klopp.. ❤ you deserve this. You have done the club more than proud
Love you, Jurgen❤️
One word describes klopp and that's LEGEND. Good luck Jurgen you have been incredible for the club.
Thank you for your sacrifices, commitment and sheer class. YNWA ❤
broken hearted. You could see its been weighing on him. Managing a club like Liverpool and all their interests its harrowing. He deserves a statue
Gutted by this sudden news 💔. Thank you for everything you've done for the club boss. Good luck in whatever your next move is... YNWA ❤
So sad. Stunned.
Ahh is real 😭😭
Before that he gets us the 20th championship😎 once red, always red legend! Thank you BOSS🥲
Whyyy😮😮😮😮
It is too soon 😢
what a ride! cant believe im hearing this now..😢 YNWA Jurgen❤
😢
xabi alonso in
This just broke me 😢 YNWA ❤
🫡🫡🫡 Nothing but respect. Our gaffer forever
Heart broken but 100% thankful he chose Us, will always be grateful for the memories. Finish on a high and go have a long rest!! YNWA
A total legend ❤
YNWA, Kloppo!!
"Don't sing my song too early" - J.K. *The Normal One*
Thank you for every beautiful moment, thank you for writing history, and thank you for loving me, Liverpool ❤
Legend. Incredible manager and definitely deserves the break. Massive shame to see him leave the prem.
My manager. What a legacy he's built.
Xabi loading...
Thanks for everything, he'll always be my favourite liverpool manager.  We now  need to enjoy the end of the season because this is the best we'll be for a long time. The good times are over after this season for a while I'm just disappointed.
It will be great to end his career with a trophy 😊
Didnt he sign a contract to 2026
Devastating news, absolutely heartbreaking YNWA
Thank you BOSS
Time to rebuild serie a. First will be klopp and guardiola will follow
Thank you gaffer
So sad news for me 😢
The man sees that he is starting to burn out, and wants to go out on his own terms. Sad news, but it’s understandable.
I am crying now, what can I do?
You are legend, you make Liverpool squad strong thank you Man.
wow this hurts differently
He'll be back
i remember being gutted when fernando torres left----this is far worse, thank you for EVERYTHING you brought to our club, especially your wonderful humanity, you will be desperately missed
Im crying rn , best manager in football history by far ❤
Only one word - Gutted....
Took us from doubters to believers ❤
Wow we can’t let him leave we need u
STATUE
this feels like my dad died
MY GOAT  Did everything for this club brought it from the bottom to the top   lets win it all for a final goodbye
Whaaaat..knew it was coming but didn't expect today.. this morning. Cant believe this in bad shock thought we'd have the pleasure of another 2 years 😥😰 You are a legend klopp n done so much for us. One of the best managers that ever lived. Take care of yourself and live your life you deserve it. Thank you Y.N.W.A ❤xx
This news is totally heartbreaking, worst then hearing any player leave the club 😢
Sir Kloppo You will remain one of the great legend of Liverpool😢 I wish you all the best!!
:(
Thank you jurgen❤
Good luck to you. It is a shock, as much to us non Liverpool supporters, as it must be to Liverpool. Cheers for the football.
I know you’ll never see this message Jurgen, but we send you only love. You did an amazing, amazing job. Just look at us now. The club, the fans, the staff. Look what you believed and worked and guided into being.   Doubters to believers.   The normal one.   You will be missed, and remembered, in this club’s history, as a legend.
This is a sad day. Thank you Jürgen for making Liverpool Great Again! YNWA!
Devo'd but he has to do what feels right - love his energy for LFC and he deserves to be recognised in someway xx Jurgen you will be missed - YNWA
I'M NOT READY FOR THIS :(
I wanted to win the cl with him
Just hard accepting this news as much as how inevitable it was that he’d leave. Klopp is nothing short of an exceptional human being, you made the club one unit, one family and a whole. Your job is not unnoticed, we appreciate you. May your life be filled with all that is good, we wish you well
:(
No😢 this is terrible news. What are we going to do. Please dont leave jurgen 😢 this cant be true. How jurgen , your wife said you need to stay sir. Please dont leave jurgen and announcing that now middle of such a crazy season is very spiteful. Please dont jurgen. We cant replace you with anybody... hopefully pep ljinders can step up. Jurgen we love you please dont leave , you one of the greatest managers in the history of our club and the world. If you go things will go downhill
There's more to this I think to loose your whole backroom team and manager smells fishy to me. I think we are in trouble at the moment everyone at the club seems to fit perfectly and to rebuild that is almost impossible. Players come to us to play for Klopp now hes going will we attract top players. Recruitment has been our strength I hope we carry on but i fear this is the Start of bad times coming.
Literally in tears. Hope we win the season as a great send off ♥️
❤❤❤❤
Klopp is our modern time Shankly, now we need our modern time Paisley. Enter: Xabi Alonso
Sad day for Liverpool fans 😢 I really can’t imagine how Liverpool will be without you 😭 YNWA Jurgen klopp🔴
thank you jurgen
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
I love you klopp
Klopp YNWA ❤
HERO one more prem for this man players should play out of there skin to send him out the way he deserves
I was in the middle of a meeting while I heard this news and now I'm literally crying and I don't remember a single thing inside my brain
one of the best at man managing, tactician and coaches.the great Jurgen.
Devastated, and understood. Thank you Jurgen Klopp. You have brought so many joys. Let's finish strong. YNWA
This is hard
Oh boy!
XABI ALONSO !!
OUR FANS BETTER SCREAM THE FUCKING HOUSE DOWN FROM NOW UNTIL THE END OF THE SEASON! WE’RE GUNNA WIN IT ALL!! ❤️❤️❤️❤ # YNWA
heartbroken
What a shame lol
He is Liverpool, I respect the decision but I'm devastated. YNWA Jurgen
Im in total shock and deep in the feels what he’s done for us as a club and supporters in every single aspect cannot be measured. I love this man he brought us back to the pinnacle of world football. thank you forever for all the memories I will cherish them for my lifetime. Incredible man YNWA ♾️❤️  I’m heartbroken but he’s built a mentality monster foundation for the torch to be carried forward.
Klopp at the heart ❤🙌 ynwa
it is sad and at the same time unexpected to hear that. but on the other side, liverpool right now is in right hands. everything goes smoothly, they're first in the premier league, they're in europa legue playoffs. it would be nice to win premier league in his last season, but even without this trophy, this era will be always legendary. thank you for everything, klopp. ynwa
What nooooooooooo
Fucking gutted, thanks for the memories Jurgen.   Get this man a statue ASAP

Good bye legend. Its shocking. 😢😢..
Even as a MU fan, I can say that these news make me sad. This man made Liverpool an amazing team that is just a joy to watch. To all the fans I wish you yet another great manager.
Jurgen Klopp a Liverpool Legend. We are going to miss you so much but totally respect you and your decision. Thank you for everything you have done for the club. It will never be forgotten. Whoever fills those boots better have the feet that fit because it is going to be tough. Liverpool fans have huge expectations and Jurgen certainly lived up to them and took them higher. YNWA

Klopp is a legend and a leader , he has trained pep his assistant properly.  Pep will do better because he won't make the mistakes Kloop did .
Xabi Alonso as our new boss!!

YNWA
제발 가지마
That's Liverpool back to mediocrity
dark days ahead for us Liverpool fans...  Of cos I do not wish this to be true, but fact is this man is irreplaceable
As a Korean Kop who has watched Liverpool's soccer since 2010, I was very grateful for showing me the team that went from bottom to top. The best coach, leader, father, and god of my life.
The end of an era. It's only now you recognise just how special it has been to get to live through Liverpool's transformation and success under him. Full respect to a wonderful human being. He is an inspiration in and outside of football  God knows where we go from here, though
Ahahaha 😂
Time to rename the Kop to the Klopp stand
We gotta push and press to make Klopp proud, he carried us through since 2015. The least we can do is make It special for him👊❤️
I am a Chelsea supporter, I must say I am really disappointed that Mr klopp is leaving, I think he is one of the best managers in the game, the premiership will be a worst place without him. Peace and happiness to you jurgen
My heart sank when I read that title. It was going to happen eventually but I thought he would see out his contract. He has done everything for this club. He will get an amazing send off! Danke Jürgen!❤️
I’ve never felt so upset what an absolutely amazing man. He’s put in so much work and effort into this club and we will never forget everything Klopp has done and accomplished for this club. A true legend of the sport ❤️  YNWA ❤
I don't worry about the future, but i will miss his character more than anything. What a guy.
خخخخ ؟
Come to AC Milan, as a Arigo Sacchi fan wouldn't be that amazing to coach his team?!
Sounds like hes ill
Don't worry Reds, BigSam's already sent his CV in, he's got you covered!
I always knew he would leave in the next few seasons and I would still be okay if he left the next season at least but this is so sudden... this is one of the darkest day of my life. I hope the players use this as motivation to repay him and win everything possible so he could leave on a high. I just hope we don't go through that "Hogson" era when he leaves. Thank you for the best times of my life in the past years, Klopp. Building a statue is not even enough to show how much you meant to us.
ขอรูปปั้นให้บอส ด้วยนะ ผมรักบอสสุดหัวใจ ปีนี้ขอ4แชมป์เพื่อบอสนะ❤❤❤
Klopp next Germany Coach
Devastated but the pressure and effort, especially after last season, the crazy close season.... What scares me is that all the coaches are leaving too, the entire team. Scary times. Love Klopp tho, that won't change.❤
YNWA❤
WoW. Sad news, but our love for LFC and our Coach tell us to just have you in our thoughts and wish ALL the best in your life Jurgen. Thanks for being our manager. Thanks.
Tears in my eyes. I'm absolutely gutted. What Happened?
i blame the tories..he wants out of mad culture wars uk
We will always love you Jurgen! Wish you all the luck! YNWA!❤
From a Madridista. I’m so sad for you but my dream manager is now available. And all I want is Trent and Klopp to take over the world In Madrid. Klopp is of my all time favorites. It was always a pleasure to face him. From Lewandowskis 4 goals and our two finals. The passion, the eye for talent. The courage to try new things. Man he’s everything I want as a coach. He’s a maniac and a human being. Love you Jurgen. Madrid is a beautiful city.
A huge loss to the club and to the Premier League. The 90 minutes that Pool and Jurgen gives us each week lessens the struggles of life.
SCOUSERS SOON BACK IN THE MUD 😂
YNWA, thank you for the memories Jürgen ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
그동안 진짜 고마웠습니다 감독님..  힘든시기 클럽을 최정상으로 만들어 주신건 평생 잊지 못할겁니다.  푹 쉬시고 다른 곳에서 만날 수 있길 바라겠습니다!  사랑해요 클롭 당신은 리버풀의 레전드 감독입니다!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢 Klopp you are the best manager Liverpool has and will ever have . LEGEND ❤
i thought this was click bait at first omds i’m gonna die
As one of the biggest Chelsea fans going, you can be rest assured that even I’ll miss him. Thank you for your service to this beautiful league, Jurgen.💙💙💙
This is the saddest day for all liverpool fans in 9 years..
Thank you jurgen for everything you are obiviosly one of the best manager in the world, thanks for your passion through out our journey for all this years and just remeber that wherever you go You'll Never Walk Alone ❤❤ Cheers boss
Thank you for everything boss. What a journey! I wish you the best, no matter what your plans are.
Will forever be a legend for us - as a 32 yo scouser he  brought me and many others happiness we couldnt imagine. Wish him nothing but the best  - YNWA
YNWA ❤ Klopp
Hopefully Liverpool will win the season for the gaffa.
i'm not a liverpool fan but even i'm shocked he's only 57 damn
Im so saddd and heartbroken 💔 I can't watch that interview otherwise i'll cry Love you jurgen - Danke ❤️
😢😢😢😢😢😢 This is super difficult to digest Wish you all the best
Why now!
One of the greatest managers of the modern era, what an inspiration. Whatever happens next we will always love you klopp. YNWA ❤️❤️
BEST MANAGER EVER
Liverpool will always have kloop in our hearts,  kloop shankly ❤❤ thank you for so much joy😢 ynwa
YNWA klopp  Thank you for everything you did for the club ❤
I can’t decide…
Thank you for all the good memories and trophies, we’ll all miss u 💔. You’ll never walk alone mate 🥰
I'm shuttered 🤦🏽‍♂️ but I'm more than grateful to have had this Genius as our Manager and i can't thank him enough for bringing us Joy over the years.  What an absolute Legend 💪🏽
... Not only Liverpool but whole EPL will miss you Klopp.... Camel league of Saudi Arabia is effecting the EPL
Gutted 😢
Dear Jurgen. I know you'll never read this. But thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for everything you ever did to our club. You transformed our club and made it great again. All the best.
No no no no no no no!!!! There is nobody in the world good enough to take his place. what a legend what a man what a manager!!!💔
I'm in shock, I thought he would be here till he retired
I love his integrity and his utter honesty in every cell in him. Complete respect and a heartful of deep thanks for all he has given to this our club. Words are not enough - but thank you!
Sad day. Thanks for everything Jürgen. Hopefully Pep leaves City when they get fined & relegated and he can go up M62.
❤thank you Klopp  You have done so much for the club & the fans around the world 🌎  Thanks for making us winners again   Y.N.W.A
kya yrr rula dia...kyu jaa rha 😭😭
Im crying ffs klopp our best manager ever ❤
Sad very Sad...Pls stay one more season
It's like my whole world just falling apart…
Thanks for everything, Mr. Klopp.
Please don’t 😔 . But thank you for everything, it’s been magical 🙏🏻. You made us dream.
He deserves only praise. Rebuilt the club. Returned the deserved glory to the city and the fans. Monuments should be build of him. Streets named. And he had the courage to rebuild the club again this year, and pass the torch of a young and energetic team to the next team of coaches and generation. Respect all around for Klopp, the legend.
Klopp the German Scouser forever❤❤
Klopp going, a body blow - but he deserves respect and will refuse to demonise him. YNWA Last time felt like this was when King Kenny stood down, highest praise possible.
Devastated
Come Home 🖤💛
It's a pretty shocking decision because it did come out of nowhere, but I understand it to a certain extent. He's been at the club for almost a decade now, and looking at the previous season, maybe he just feels like he's lost his edge and wants to quit while he's ahead. That being said, I am worried, because the last time a manager left a club after a rebuilding project that went on for this long, the club turned into a joke (I don't think I need to name the club, I have no vendetta against them, but that's the truth really), and has continued to be a joke for a decade now, and I don't really want that to happen to Liverpool. I think the next season will certainly be interesting.
RESPECT FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND PASSION.
by chance a video of his first press conference came up and i watched it. and now I see this. strange!! He kepts his promises. Amazing career!
Legend. I hope he stays a familiar face at Anfield.
ทิ้งตำนาน 4 แชมป์ไว้ให้ชาวเราระลึกถึงที...❤❤❤
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 I am so so so so sad
Where do we go from here??
❤
For me this is real disaster
Nooooooooooo😢 please
Very difficult news to take, 😢but I wish him nothing but the best in whatever he does next, thank you for the Memories Jurgen ❤❤❤YNWA.
You will always The klop until you died .... The normal one .... Love you JK
I am absolutely shocked and disappointed. Our club is stuffed. There are only a few top managers and they are taken and the other, Alonso who’s up and coming probably won’t come to Liverpool just yet if it’s possible
YWNWA
Thank you Jurgen! YNWA! Lets win it all this season :)
will miss you Jurgen 😢😢 all the best for future ❤❤ YNWA
We Love you Klopp and we will never stop ❤
YNWA
But why is he leaving????!!!!
gutted
This has come as a shock but it was inevitable. Thank you so much for everything you've done for us , the club, the people of Liverpool. You gave us hope , love, tears. We'll never forget Jurgen. You are by far one of the best managers this club has ever seen ❤
I'm a real madrid fan but I love the klopp Liverpool. I hope they don't get the post klopp disaster like united had with SAF
Nooooo 😭💔 can't think of Liverpool without Klopp 😢🥺
So heartbroken but we have to accept and respect his wishes YNWA
Noooo wayyyy
Please help bring in Xabi before you go.
Love the man!!! YNWA!!!
OH MY GOD, STILL UNBELIEVABLE😢😢😢
Come try a new challenge by coaching man UTD
Damn… leave on top brave man 🫡
Klopp is irreplaceable. This is so depressing
i am a Rangers fan but have lots of love and respect for this man he dragged liverpool up like gerrard done for us am gutted for liverpool hes one of the best managers i have ever seen
Without Klopp,.Pep will dominate the EPL until he retires
Well this has messed my year up! Absolutely devastated
I'm so shocked , but we will continue to love you everywhere you go, and thank you for putting our club on a higher pedestal, thank you boss
Please don’t go to Madrid
😔 YNWA ❤
Appreciate everything this great man has done. However this was not the right time to announce something of this gratitude. This could potentially be a successful season but this will cause a dip in moral amongst the team and staff. Should have waited until May.😢
Klopp to Bayern here we go...
It had to happen sometime, but it’s still a shock. One of the very best of all time. Thank you Jurgen. “I’m so glad that Jurgen is a Red” YNWA ❤
liverpool will back to default team , middle club
Wait he is leaving nah 😭
Build this man a statue. He single handedly transformed this club. YNWA❤
You will be missed dearly Boss!!! Thanks for all that you've done for the club..you passion, your results..getting the Champions league victory followed by English Premier League champions...i wish you all the best for your next endeavour in life!!! i am teary eyed!
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Alot of people went against him when he said Antivax are like drunk drivers.
What a man, what a manager. Thank you for the past 9 years YNWA
Did not think I would ever hear this, Hes 75%  of the reason why I chose Liverpool as my club and this is like a dagger to my heart man Klopp ynwa
You can't possibly imagine the football longevity Sir Alex had now.
💔
Bring on Mourinho
What a shock. Goat manager ❤ miss you 😢
I didn't like Liverpool but I've grown to adore the fans the atmosphere mostly because of klopp brilliant person brilliant manager
Thank you for everything Boss ♥️😢🥹
Living a “normal life” is massively overrated Jurgen…. 😢  Shanks couldn’t get over the heartbreak of leaving. Beware what you’re walking away from, these could very well be the greatest days of your life.   That all being said, I wish you nothing but happiness. Thank you.  - Please don’t pop up at Real in 6 months.
Build him a statue!
Lets go boys! This is the season to remember.
Damn.  Why will he leave?  Salah will go too end of season.
Let’s hope we can win everything for Klopp this season and give him the send off he deserves! YNWA
But Liverpool 2.0 just began 😢😢
He’s not leaving
NOOOOO!!!!!
Even though I'm a Chelsea fan... It's sad. Jurgen is one of the best coaches in the world. To lead the club for 9 years, to lead it to the PL Cup after 30 years... What Liverpool fans used to say? YNWA? I'll say the same. I will be rooting for you in the Premier League... But not in the Carabao Cup)
YNWA❤
To announce this in the middle of a season during a title race with a cup final coming up is a bit mad to say the least.
You’ll Never Walk Alone Klopp, so gutted to see you leave at the end of the season😞
The best deal of all time is Jürgen Klopp, a legend forever. ❤️😓
😭
Welcome Xabi Alonso
I actually feel sick.... I can't believe it
Klopp please😭😭😭😭😭😭
Something has happened behind the scenes
Thank you, Jürgen!
I really love how you managed our club you made it amazing it’s always interesting and amazing club but l swear to god we’ll miss you so much lots of times klopp  we’ll never walk alone and you we’ll never walk alone l love you and l respect you as well as l will respect you forever insha Allah and l wish you good every time it’s hard to say you bye but good bye 👋 with love and respect lots of love ❤️ we have to accept your decision and we have to respect your decision ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

The most heartbreaking news
Danke für all deine Mühen, Jürgen! ❤
“Eras come to an end”😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you for all that you have done for us. Jürgen you’ll always have a place in all Liverpool supporters hearts!
Forever a Kloppite ❤
I will never manage another club in the premier league!! Liverpool is family ❤
This is brilliant.  1 title in 8 years and he's off 😂  Give it 2 years and Heysel FC will be back to where they belong: 8th in the league and winning nothing 😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
I am stopping going to the games after this news. I will always love the club but this has knocked me out.
alonso now
As a long time MUFC fan, Klopp has done an absolutely amazing job for Liverpool, shocked and surprized, by this decision.
He pulled a Zidane!
Xabi alonso next red manager?
Ynwa klopp ynwa
he doesnt want to make the same mistake that arsene wenger made.
I am so sad …
Not looking forward to his last game, not what I wanted to hear on my Birthday, Klopp you've don't know what you have done for me in your time here, you've made me so happy. I do respect your decision, you deserve to live your life ❤️
This is so difficult but we love you Jürgen, always and forever our legend🔴
Omg
this is more than a heartbreak, he's done a lot for the team way beyond achievements he natured love within the club. He's irreplaceable we will truly miss his presence in the team. YNWA KLOPP❤
Legend of Legends, thank you for everythings, Klopp. YNWA
David Ngog coming back in
Hope liverpool can win some trophies before he leaves
❤❤legend always Y.N.W.A
Get this man a statue! Danke Jurgen. You've made us doubters into believers ❤

I love you forever
Rip
The day that I always feared is finally arrive, Thanks for everything Jürgen ❤
I miss you man 💔😞
Why in the middle of the season announce this ? Why hasnt he got the energy ? He normally elaborates alot more. Could have seen out his contract.
YNWA  Respect and understand this decision, I will cheer twice as hard for this season, Thank you for everything Jürgen ❤
IT'S still January... and i got 💔 twice😢😢😢😭😭
A statue with Klopp and Shankly shoulder to shoulder in front of Anfield Please

Liverpool going back to a mid table team 😂 YESSSSSSSS
There's something more to this
Forever loved and will always be missed once he goes. Fans will always hold a special place in our hearts for him, he brought us back after so long without success and I for one can’t thank him enough. YNWA Jürgen you’ll always be part of Liverpool.
WE LOVE YOU FOREVER 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 JURGEN ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
4,399 Love LIVERPOOL from Thailand ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂
You have been great and will always be a part of Liverpool.  Good luck at your next job ❤
My call is promises broken constantly by the owners in the market. This January window could be final straw. Why else take all the coaching staff.
You Will Never Walk Alone Klopp😢😢😢
I thot this was clickbait😢 Legend will be missed, person and gaffer❤
I'm crying
Gonna miss JK, 😭. YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE GAFFER ❤️
No matter where you go Klopp, we'll always be here for you! You came into LFC and have built a team that no one can rival! It took you time but we always stood by you even in tough times (especially during COVID and even when on a bad run of games)! You've won every title that you could dream of and you will always be part of LFC's history as one of the greatest LFC managers that the club ever had! Thank you for everything Jurgen ❤! YNWA
first owen  then xabi then torres then suarez then gerrad(could understand that) then coutinho and now the big one. I hate football
This man is legend YNWA ❤
Klopp out 🥲🥲🥲🥲
I feel like I just heard one of my family died💔😭
Thank you for everything you’ve done for the city and the club, you’ll always be loved gaffer ❤️
Will still always love this man wherever he goes next after his sabbatical. He came in and transformed this into an absolute force to be reckoned with and he gave me some of the most enjoyable moments of my life as a Liverpool supporter. Thank you Jurgen, you’ll never walk alone ❤️
YNWA jürgen
What a legendary football manager 👏👏👏
Thank you for everything you have given this club ❤ YNWA
Thanks for everything boss ❤ YNWA

아니 이게 대체 무슨 소리여
Damnnnnnnn😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
YNWA Jurgen, sad this day has come but glad this is the way it will happen, you’ve given many of us the best memories of our lives ❤
I love this guy! I really hope he’s not trying to hide a health condition? Bless him 🙏 He has done so much for the people of Liverpool and the club! 👊👊👊
I was devastated when Shankly left. This feels just the same.
It will be harder to get player's to the club now bec everyone loves klopp.
Dear Jurgen Klopp, this is a hard pill to swallow but we understand. Youve changed us from doubters to believers, you made so many of us fall in love with football again with your passion, style of play and countless silverware. But most importantly you were a great human being, a father figure for those who needed guidance. We will always support you and you'll always hold a special place in our hearts ❤  Believer LFC Fan YNWA❤ 🇸🇬
Thank you, Klopp!
Whaaat......Nooooo😢😢😢
2024, totally sucks. I'm over it. I'm done!!
God bless you Jurgen, thank you for everything ❤️❤️❤️
Terima Kasih Uncle Kloop
😢
MOST HUMBLE MAN IN FOOTBALL HISTORY
Tell me it's a April Fools 😢
I love you Jurgen Klopp
I love you man❤ Fully support you
So sad😢😢😢 I'm Egyptian but I love Liverpool because of Klopp and when I want to win the premier league I want klopp win it at first
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I refuse to believe this announcement. It must be some kind of prank to the fans to see the reaction of the news, right? Please tell me I'm right. I can't take it. 😢
Gonna miss you Boss ❤❤❤❤
this man deserves a statue. Will always follow klopp wherever he goes❤️❤️ LIVERPOOL
Go to chelsea ❤
without you i dont we can progress but we will make sure your legacy isnt ruined . YNWA
gutted
Xabi Alonso please 😢
YNWA, Thank you for all joy moments.
Thanks for the memories gaffer 😭❤️
😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭 It's thunder in daylight... He make football more advance & entertaining Danke Her Klopp
devastated doesn't even come close
I’m absolutely gutted 🥲
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😭😢
Fair do’s…. He’s won it all…Get him a statue!
Thank you for everything Klopp, I will miss you❤❤❤
Build him his statue.
I swear if he don’t get a statue before the new season
I woke up to this news
Thank you Jürgen! As a life long Liverpool fan I have loved watching Liverpool team under your management. Your achievements will be hard to match. GREAT MAN and you will be missed always. YNWA
Xabi Alonso is the only option we have , nobody else!
We need xabi alonso in summer who will not replace klopp but he will atleast lessen the forever hurt.
Thank you BOSS, you deserve the best because you gave us your best. YNWA
They better give Pep Lijnders a chance to continue with the same system and enviroment. The last thing we need is some "outsider" coming in and changing everything. We need another Shankly Paisley continuity.
YNWA Klopp
I think this is all from the news Liverpool are thinking of doing a behind the scenes documentary. Jürgen always said if the club does something like that he will leave.   I am heartbroken I love this man so much!
Love ye Jurgen. ❤
Germany job as its not full time work
Jürgen Klopp fit LFC like a glove and he has indeed become a legend. Sadly, LFC didn't fit Klopp as perfectly but I am so happy we got to have him at all.
Can someone wake me up? 😢
No 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Man now no need manager will play the presing style of football , were doomed
Respect your decision boss and thank you for everything you did for the club🙇🏻🙏🏻🫶🏻
Love you klopp❤
Forever you shall remain a scouse KLOPPO 😭😭   YNWA
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he just can’t overcome Pep, so he’s running away 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Heartbroken. Now please bring Xavi Alonso
Let's win the Prem for the last time with him this season!!!
No one will ever forget Jurgen. The greatest liverpool manager in my lifetime surely. YNWA
🤦🏾‍♂️Mannnnnnnn!!!!..... this shock this..the whole of my Friday morning and beyond.... SMH...Eow🤦🏾‍♂️.. I need time to swallow this...
Just get Alonso then
Worst news ever, build the statue now.  XABI ALONSO IS THE BEST REPLACEMENT!!!
😢
we wish u the best
Kloppo ❤
It hurts more than a heart break🥺❤️
He will be absolutely missed and needs a statue now. Thank you Jurgen for everything over the years, you are a legend and always will be. I wish you well for whatever you do next.
In the words of Ten Hag:   Eras have to come to an end 🥹
Barcelona ❤
Gutted. Ynwa.
Im so glad that Jurgen is a red! <3
Definitely did not see that coming. Words can't express how grateful I am for what this man has done. YNWA Jurgen ❤
Well now we need to finish his last season as strong as possible ❤
We've been blessed to have you so long❤.  Let's win this league!!
Aduh.. Tiber.. Demmit lah
Tears in my eyes. I'm absolutely gutted. 😢 Danke, Jurgen.
waduh sedih
Am so sad to hear 😢😢
Im so sad right now
Thank you kloop❤️ we loved and we will always love you YNWA...😢
Klopp has given me the best footballing memories that I’ve ever had as a fan, and I believe I’ll hold onto them for the rest of my life. Thank you Jurgen!
I’m a United fan. This is a genuine question. Do you lot ever feel cheated out of more success. 1. Because of city cheating and 2. because you board never invested properly. You have good recruitment but I feel like if you guys invested a lil bit more every year you could’ve competed with city more  I wouldn’t  admit this to people I know that are Liverpool fans. But I always said klop for me is the best manager in the league. And you really would’ve expected more before he left. Like I said I really think ur owners messed up by not spending more
Top manager. 🐐
Bad news ever for lfc :(
Shocker, the sad type 😞
Thank you for making me love the game and this club <3
I am a Manchester united fan and i love this Guy ... Sad day ... Sad day for EPL in general 😢
As a Manchester United fan. This guy showed and changed modern football. He brought that gegen pressing and fast flowing counter attacking football. The only person who went toe to toe with Pep's Manchester City. Probably Pep feared his time the most. When I look at Liverpool's matches sometimes. I see perfection and swift attacking football just like Manchester City. Given the fact that he didn't have much resources given. It was all his brains he developed a world class team. Absolute legend Jurgen Klopp ❤️
❤ All you need is ❤️ Jürgen Klopp ❤️ YNWA ❤️
Oh no!!!
Thank you for destroying us 7 nil unforgettable
Don't follow liverpool but love klopp .He is the best Manager and loved his passion for the game . Boom❤
I need to be alone for a bit to process the news. All I know now is that he needs the best send off at the end of the season.
At the 7 stages of grief
Omg no, I'm devastated 😭. This legend needs a statue outside the stadium. Klopp is irreplaceable and will be sorely missed.
QUADRUPLE LOADING ........❤❤❤
im bawling my eyes out currently, this was so unexpected and the biggest fear as a fan please it wouldn't affect me if all the players would leave the club rn but not this man 😢 it's always such a relief to see that we've him on the sidelines, this is very heartbreaking i love you klopp ❤
This man brought us back, brought us glory & gave us many many memories... I'm gutted, but so thankful for what he has done for us & how many managers leave when the team is doing great, so the next manager can just come in & concentrate on keeping the good form going, none!! Hate this, but we love, respect & trust in everything Jurgen has ever done & know this decision he's making, he thinks is for the best of the club. So thank you for the memories Jurgen, we love you. Now build this man a statue asap...  YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE JURGEN ❤❤❤❤❤❤
End of an Era ! He won everything possible for us. Will always be the GOAT 🐐 ❤
last time i checked its not april fools??
YNWA boss
Thank you for everything Herr Klopp, you made us all believe again, it’s been a hell of a ride…take care and good luck in the future
I'm very sad to see Klopp leave but wish him and his family all the best for the future, He came in as the "Normal One" and became a managerial legend who reconnected the fans with the club they love YNWA
❤❤❤
Nooo
Big up to jurgen klopp gentlemen lovely character. Elite manager who won it all for liverpool. The connection he has with the club and fans is beautiful to see. Good luck to him.
I dread this day would come 😢
Big respect for jurgen klopp YNWA ❤please bring xavi Alonso
He saved Liverpool football club.
Will things ever be the same ????😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
😢😢😢😢😢😢 YNWA Jurgen
Why? Why? Why? Why?😭😭😭
Un-replaceable - YNWA
Man took the club to heights we thought we wouldnt see again
Klopp is a great manager! Thank you for everything !  Liverpool should get Alonso as a manager now
A sad day for Liverpool FC. Truly end of an era!
I’m hurt😭
Thank you Jurgen from the bottom of my heart, for all the memories.
F********k. Don't go Klopp. You are the best manager in the world. Thank you for everything you have done for Liverpool Football Club.
Noooooooooo😢
Gutted. Thank you for everything, Jurgen Klopp xxx.
I’m devastated …
A premier league and statue unveiling is the only way for him to go out
KLOPP IS ENGLANDS NEXT BOSS & MEETS MESSI & ARGY IN WORLDCUP Final 2026.             AFTER COVID & LOSING BOTH PARENTS, HE NEEDS A BREAK. ALL ENGLAND FANS RESPECT him like sir Alf & Shanks & Busby & Clough (even the Manc's). 99% fans want him to go out in a blaze of glory by winning QUAD of wembly lg &  fa cups &  eufa &  prem champs. So C'mon LFC boys, destiny is calling & no one wants the ALLEGED FFS cheats of pep to win anything. Do it 4 KLOPP ❤  WE AR LIVERPOOL
This is crazy , nobody expected this to happen.  I am speechless 😢  Thank you for everything Klopp
Thank you for your dedication
It's a great loss for the REDS 😢 Do we know who will manage the REDS now😭😭😭😭
Absolutely gutted, but thank you, Klopp, for everything.
YNWA😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
YNWA Gaffer! All the best! Now let's win at least one trophy this season
My manager❤
This is sad! 😢
He will have a rest then manage the german team
From an Arsenal fan, this man is a legend. As much as he's made my life as a gooner very miserable, he will be missed. A proper gentleman and wholly decent man.
i can’t believe it, Klopp really is leaving 😢  Thank you for everything Klopp YNWA❤
no no no no noooooooooo. pleaseeee nooooooooo
Klopp = Legend. Thank you for all the memories.
Please get Xabi Alonso...please
😢😢😢😢😢
Hope I'm wrong but like when Ferguson left Man Utd I feel our club will now not be successful anymore. Thank you for everything Jurgen. One of the greatest managers in the history of our club. LFC please make sure you get the next manager correct
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭WTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTF

Time to start working on a statue of this man outside Anfield. 🙏 LEGEND.
Rokn Roll uchitel
No man no!!! This is something I wasn't ready for ! 😭
I was just about to go to bed…  oh my God… I can’t sleep!💤  No wonder the players are playing out of their skin for him. They must have known…
You have filled me with so much joy, you will always be Liverpool and as a fan, I can't thank you enough for the memories and the passion you gave to this club.
I'm numb
Xabi Alonso incoming
Hope he comes home to Dortmund was great to see him do so well with Liverpool over the last 9 years
Damn it's a really hard thing to hear. But all we as Liverpool fan can say is that we have absolutely loved your stay at Liverpool ❤️ YNWA
I can’t say I’m not sad with this decision I can’t say I’m not mad either but thank you jurgen. Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for us. Thank you for showing that this club is beyond football.. this club is a family. You’ll always be the man who made me fall in love with this sport. I love you
Welp, we're screwed.  This is the reason why I always said I never cared if Salah left, as THIS GUY is the most important person at our club.  Now we need Salah more than ever as the main man is gone and we'll need all the suport we can get.  DEVASTATING NEWS!!!
Whyyyy no Please Stayyy am I dreaming 😥😥😥😥😥😥 I wish there was a way he could do limited role, all the best Coach….
I’am really upset on this Thursday morning I am crying 😭.He is God to Liverpool who can take over from him. You’ll never walk alone.GodBless ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
감독님 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Legend. YNWA JURGEN
I'm in denial

Good luck Jurgen it takes a toll on you and it's a very stressful job so when your gone have a rest then come back when your ready. Also get a new challenge
My mentor, anywhere u go, am with u, thank u for everything u have done for this club
I'm heartbroken.  We love you klopp
😭😭😭😭😭
NOOOOOOOOO
This news broke my heart 💔…YNWA Jurgen ❤️🙏🏽
100% got cancer or something similar, this is out of no where, clearly knows he is going to be declining with his health, let’s win the quadruple for his last season, for Klopp
😢😢😢😢
This interview shows so well, why we love him.  he will be so missed, but everybody will hopefully accept his decision. and leave him to just do his job now and rest later. he earned every bit of it :D   For the future i hope Xabi alonso could be an option. or maybe Pep Ljinders could take over.
no..........................................................................................................................................................................
I feel sick😢
YNWA
No point in living anymore I reckon.
I expected it  a year or two ago when he was looking very drained and tired. But he seemed like he had gotten his energy back, so its a shock.
Xabi Alonso in please
Build him a statue, let's give him a proper send off.
No kloop,,, 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Jurgen: you have to do what is best for you and your family. To say we will miss you is an understatement, BUT we are all supportive of you. You are and will remain an adopted son of our fair city and will always be in our hearts amigo.
Noooooooo, no way, 😢😢😢😢
One of if not the greatest managers of all time. An honest man and Liverpool fans have been privileged to have him. Will be sorely missed and I am an Evertonian. Good luck Jurgen.
Gutted, but I understand. You have given me so much. You represent the highest level of character. I do love you sir. May God watch over you in all you do. YNWA
Omg omg omg….. I am devastated!!!

This is like a bomb for all liverpool fans ! I can not believe this and so upset but the life goes on so thank you Kloop for everything you done for this beloved club
I'm genuinely heartbroken all good things come to an end but I didn't expect it to happen this quick 😢 build that man a statue ❤

I literally fall from the stairs 🥺😓 somebody please tell me this is some kind of joke
Devastated, but thanks Jurgen ❤😢
my heart aches
🤣 the decline. We've been praying for this day. This man has been performing miracles there.
Klopp needs to sit down with our next manager and explain to him his thought process in matches, otherwise we are completely screwed. His man management in games in levels above anyone else in world football.
You will be missed forever, Jurgen. Thank you for everything you have done for us! 😔 ❤
nooooo nooooo !!! TT
I am honestly heart broken. Just saw the news of Jurgen Klopp leaving at the end of the season. Speechless. Thanks to you I saw LFC at the top. You turned us from doubters to believers. The best manager in the world. Thank you for everything. 🥺   YNWA, Jurgen.
Schade,aber nachvollziehbar, so ein Job kostet sehr viel Kraft
Kloppp pleaseeee noooo
NOOO 😭😭 HE IS THE BIGGEST LIVERPOOL LEGEND WITHOUT PLAYING
We will miss you, Jürgen. You are one the greatest managers this club has ever seen. One day there'll be a statue of you outside Anfield.
We LOVE you, Jurgen. YNWA.
This man deserves a quad... 😢😭🙌
Jurgen Klopp i love you. It's never the same without you. You deserve a rest though. You've given so much joy and honours to the club. I am very sad but i am support everything you do. YNWA.

We love you Jurgen. You are Liverpool family forever. Got me into tears and so sad to imagine you not here with us YNWA my hero
Absolutely shocked. What a legend. Big boots to fill... Who could manage liverpool with his character and drive and passion for the club?. 😢
Devastated
He came and built golden city from the mud.
Liverpool gonna be the new Manchester United LOL
Is he going to be Germany manager?  Also I am going to be talking about how amazing Klopp is until I die. I'm going to talk about the amazing things he's done for us.
It's very disappointing  klopp😢😢
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Feels like losing a dad
The best manager I will ever see manage Lfc. From a selfish point of view this is devastating for the club, klopp is the only reason we've won anything. Wish you well kloppo. So grateful for everything you've given us, the standard of football, everything. In total shock 😢
As a nearly 43 year old man Mr Klopp made me more proud than ever to wear the liver bird on my chest, today is devastating news but you sir deserve all the respect in the world for your decision and I wish you well with the rest of your life. Thank you Mr Klopp for all the happy memories ❤ YNWA 🫶

Thank you a for all these amazing years Jurgen. Thank you making us a believer. We love you and we wish you all the best ❤
Even us Man Utd fans must respect him as a guy.
The mannschaft are calling after your deserved break <3 , Boss Alonso or De Zerbi hopefully follows to Liverpool next summer, YNWA
YNWA👑
I can't believe my eyes. Please don't go. 😢

Xabi alonso will replace him that is the way forward
Thank you Jurgen. Sad news but YNWA.
Devastated.

Jurgen Klopp, you are a Liverpool FC legend and will remain forever. The happiness you brought, the teams you built, and the spirit took your name up there with Persley and Shankly. A heartily Thank You for everything. YNWA
WHY WHY WHY PLEASEE NO WHY WHY SO RANDOMLY BOSS
Imagine if Liverpool fall into a post-Ferguson level
You'll always be in our hearts. You'll Never Walk Alone Jurgen ❤
Take a leaf outta roy hodgsons book, cant leave a team in the middle of a process 😴quite annoyed really
Ill miss seeing lashing up and down the line,in fairness he has been outstanding liverpool to the core.
This is the saddest day in my Liverpool-life
Hopefully the club appoint a really good replacement for klopp  and not someone who wants it just because its liverpool f.c not Gerrard but would take Alonso or Jose Mourinho.
Please tell me this is an early April fools 😢
Gutting, please get Xabi Alsonso to replace him
Get this man a statue. Thank you Jurgen ❤  YNWA  "It's not important what people think when you come in, it's much more important what people think when you leave"
I am shocked and sad
xabi alonso …
Thanks you Jürgen , YNWA🔥❤️😢
Damn this is so sad to hear, I hope he enjoys whatever he goes on to do.   9 Damn good years  YNWA Klopp
Thank you sir for everything
I feel crushed but still support your decision....😢
I FEEL ILL
We got your back, do your best finish this season and then enjoy your life and live it to the fullest ❤
Thank you for making me fall in love with football and this club ❤ YNWA❤️
I filed for divorce with my wife after watching this. Kids r crying. Thanks klopp
Cant blame him being up against the cheater the last 6 years, id be absolutely exhausted fighting the impossible fight too. Thanks for everything Jurgen, you have been unbelievable.
NOOOO KLOPP NOOOOOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Please come back one day! I can't belive this :(
Thank you Jürgen ❤
Bring in Gerrard
bring xabi alonso back to anfield
Heart-wrenching. Father-figure. Leader. And statesman-esque. Remember his letter when covid hit?
Damn didn't expect this but it's understandable because being a coach takes such a huge amount of pressure and enegy. This is a job that is highly underrated and not fully understood. So all the  best coach. Long live.i don't think there will ever be a greater coach than you.
This hurts big time. You gotta love Klopp if you are a Liverpool fan. Nothing will be the same after this.
From paris down to turkey, Jurgen will never walk alone. YNWA❤
Don't mind me. Just crying in a corner 😢
So shocked am teary
BUILD.THIS.MAN.A.STATUE
Gutted...just...gutted.  Thanks for everything. YNWA

What you did for this great Club cannot be described in words, you brought us back from the doldrums of mediocrity and took us to the very top of the world.  You will always be my Bill Shankly and I will never forget the memories we shared.  You fought for us, you won for us, now you can rest.   YNWA Jurgen 🔴

If want to come back, please come back home ❤❤❤❤
Xabi Alonso 🙏
I will always accept and support Klopp's decision. He has done so much for the club and deserves to choose his own destiny. Heartbroken, but you will always be part of the LFC family. Danke schön, Jürgen.
This is a sad, sad moment but this man does have his own life.
dang
Even as a rival fan, this is heartbreaking to lose one of the greatest managers. Now Pep will be completely unrivalled
Xabi Alonso or Pep Ljinders 😭😭
No no no no no no no no no no
As A Man United Fan this man has my utmost respect transformed Liverpool and its genuinely sad to see him leave he's the only manager able to compete with Pep without him City will dominant for years
there is 100% a bigger reason for this... why announce it today? just made a cup final.. top of the league... fighting on all fronts.. something we are not being told about all this!!
Heartbroken. Forever grateful to Jürgen
This comes as a shock 😢but we accept and respect your decision. YNWA
100 statues of him couldn't even bring enough respect to what he's done for us. He's the best
That also means Salah might be heading to Saudi in the summer 🙌 ETH was right sometimes eras come to an End😢
This is the worst day of my life.
Klopp Noooooo
If you want a break we can get an interim manager and later you can join again. Jurgen we need you.
Absolutely devastated, I knew it would happen eventually but wasn’t ready for this
Unai emery
Thank you for what you did for Liverpool and still doing .I appreciate you .God bless you wherever you go .but you can leave us with a bang .thank you .
If we dont bring in Xabi Alonso am going to be very disappointed
Thanks boss and appreciate you for telling us your decision. Now let's make this another memorable season!

Devastating news...ynwa kloppo..now we have to send him out a winner.
No this cant be true.. Is it a joke???  No klopp, you cant leave
Ild take alonso personally
if he needs a break why doesn't he put his second as an interim and come back in a year. Now all the rebuild will be in danger with a new managers vision
❤👏👏Danke Jurgen
As a Gooner.. this is… a SHOCKING NEWS.. In a negative way of course. 😢
I have nothing to say, but.. Thank you Jurgen! Your the best manager Ive ever witness so far for Liverpool. You're a legend! YNWA
So this is where Mourinho comes
Thanks for everything, boss! You started from Europa League final in 2015, it 100% would be a great story to end it like that now.
I feel like one of my relatives has died😭😭😭😭
Xavi Alonso is coming to Liverpool next season then
Thank you Klopp for all those memories.

Thank you for the memories.
A living legend, up there with the greats. What a bombshell... It's like Shanks in 1974 all over again.
Oh man... He left the team in tip top state just as he said though... Maybe it's time for Xabi to come home
BOSS!!!!!❤

He knows nothing will come off the ffp allegations with city and pepdiola will continue spending billions on 2nd choice left backs
My manager.  Thank you for your dedication to our club, I never thought what you've achieved could be possible.  Doubters, to believers - Love you, Kloppo.
Why??? Why?? No!!
Xabi Alonso has to step up for us
I want to cry 😢
It is very shocking and I knew the time will come someday but didn’t expect now… I loved him and I loved his every decision he made. I loved his passion and how mange the game too.  No matter where he’ll go, I will support him and wish him the best luck.  You are one of the best managers in the world and in Liverpool history. Thank you for everything you’ve done for our club!! You’re always with us. YNWA❤
Nur Liebe für Klopp❤

Absolute legend. Gutted you are leaving but this is part of life and I'm sure the majority will wish you the absolute best.
So sad. We love you
Not a Liverpool fan but this is really really sad
Us Liverpool Fans in Japan will be forever grateful to Klopp for restoring our pride and our team identity. He deserves every right to make the decision for his future and he has put Liverpool in the best possible health for a handover to the new chapter. Domo Arigatou Gozaimasu Klopp San and we wish you great health and happiness in your next adventure, as you have provided us with a lifetime of memories! <3 YNWA
United fan sad to see a top manager go
YNWA boss ❤
This is why we should step up and win the prem, Europa league, carabao cup and FA Cup! We can do it reds! YNWA!!
Gonna miss this guy so much
💔💔
The more I want Liverpool to win this season!
Why did u have to make me cry so early
After that many years, it makes sense you lose the hunger and to stay motivated after basically winning everything. We all feel that way in life sometimes. One of the best managers to ever grace the PL.
Omg klopp.......plss Don't do that.....😢😢😢
Liverpool please win the season for Klopp.
Can't even watch the whole thing without being emotional. Where do we go from here?
This is devastating
😢
We must give him a proper farewell by winning the Premier league and the quadruple❤❤😢
No way's 😭😭😭, please stay 🙏🏿🙏🏿
please tell me Im dreaming
Devastating news 😭😭😭😭 YNWA Jürgen
once you guys lost mane it all went downhill .... that dude was playing like a animal for couple years
😭
I like klop a lot, for him to stay in the club for 8 years. More then at BD. It's i alway in my mind that klop always resign from a manager at 7 years. But still he stay one more years. Hope you find the next place. But still i hope klop still give us a hope and believe for the better Liverpool. Time for other to step up.. gerard, alonso, cara, or else.
Jeeeeez. Man City will win everything now. 😢😢😢😢
Rebuild going so well it feels premarure he is 56 years old not 65. However I get that being a manager is very hard and intense he better take 2 years off and maybe be German manager. YNWA klopp we love you thanks for everything.
FFS!!!!!
love Jurgen . Better get Xabi lined up
i don't know how to feel 💔
I still can not believe it, my fingers are crossed it is all the work of AI. How could this be happening? This hurt more than when my first gal told me it wasn't working out and needed time. I am not ready for this, please reconsider for two more years😟😟😟
Liverpool are cooked
one word: irreplaceable. 🐐❤️
Noooooooooooooo
we are so finished
Nooooooo. please take another Jurgen in South Korea
How do i end it all😢
Thank you Jürgen ❤😢
It suck that he is leaving but this man changed my life as a liverpool fan. I wish you all the best boss❤❤❤❤. Thanks for bring us back to where we belong you will be missed💪
We love u klopp❤️
Xabi Alonso to replace him thats it.
😭😭😭😭❤❤❤Love you Jurgen❤❤❤
This sucks.
Whatever happens to him, YNWA
Damn this feals like a death in the family. I never wanted this day to come. Please build this man a statue ❤
SHOCKING!!!
I am fuckin devastated
You'll never walk alone, we love you ❤😢
Great manager. But above all else an absolutely outstanding person who just understood everything about Liverpool. We will never get a manager like this again, thank you for everything Klopp ❤

hes sick of paul tierney
noooo jurgen i will forever love you . i cant believe its the end of the era
The owners have sold him out with that amazon series. He was always against it, its clear they went behind his back to do it! Its obvious those rumours come out and suddenly this happens. What a tragic and emotional day for the club, city and players. The great man, amazing person and incredible manger.
Good on LFC that its announced well before.. so this guy can get all the special tributes and farewell that he deserves. Cant imagine LFC with you Jurgen but hope you have a great life ahead. It will be emotional end to this season no matter what happens
But that will be after next season. That'll be a long one and half years.
😢😢😢😢😢 Nooooo
We love you ynwa definitely we will miss you Soo much I'm so sad 😭
😢😢😢😢very sad news, I was having a good day before this news
He is now taking a well-deserved break for 1-2 years and then maybe the German national team will come for a new challenge.
we love you jurgen build him a statue
I’ll miss him truthfully 😢
Barcelona
wait wat?
Hopefully the team gives their all and wins all 4 trophies for him. YNWA
Who will be his successor 😢. This is sad but why do I feel the management and their transfer strategy has made him to leave
Sad news but nothing but absolute respect for Jurgen as a manager and a person I wish him and his all the very best for the future YNWA

Wow! I’m a huge City fan but I got to speak with him for 10 minutes in private when they visited South Bend, IN, USA to play Dortmund and he is single-handedly the most humble high-level coach I’ve ever met.
This has to be a joke! 🤬🙁
I'm absolutely gutted but this great man has given his all to our club. Hope we can finish this season on a high its the very least he deserves ❤. YNWA Jurgen.
I appreciate him telling the truth...slightly early is always better than slightly to late
How sad. Who will take over???
Its funny that I'm a Manchester united fan and i find this really sad, i love jurgen
I am not ready for this, but still that time will come eventually...  Thanks Jurgen for anything, you lead the team and won trophies there and there, we definitely will miss you..  YNWA

Thank you for the good times jurgen
come on LIVERPOOOL lets give this fella the best send off possible......UP THE MIGHTY REDS....
Modern Premier League legend
Thank you for being our manager for this period. Devastated by the news, but the club and supporters remain. YNWA!
У меня нет слов... Спасибо за всё, что ты сделал для моего любимого клуба Юрген 🙏🏻❤️ Ты уже легенда для всех нас и на одном пъедестале с великими Биллом, Бобом и Кенни🌟 Спасибо за всё, всего самого наилучшего тебе и твоей семье
I can't believe this is real, I'm lost for words, I knew he'd leave some day but I'm still shocked, legend is not even strong enough a word to describe this man and what he's done for this club...
Well this has ruined my weekend, God damn it i wish it lasted forever T.T
YNWA JURGEN❤️
Heartbroken 💔
The time has come . A legend ❤
Damn I never comment on anything but this this deserves a comment. Thanks jurgen for taking us from Ricky lambert, balotelli, and benteke. To sadio mane Robert firmino and mo salah …. Good times ! You made Liverpool relevant again! Up the reds ! Thanks jurgen for everything
Nah this can't be real
He is already immortalised in our hearts and minds. But please I beg that the club itself somehow honours what this man has done for the Supporters, Players and Club. Name a field after him, a stand, build him a statue. The family of Liverpool Football Club will never ever forget what you have done. It has been an absolute privilege to watch you, Ive always supported you regardless of bad or good season. Jürgen you are something special. YNWA. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything. I wish you nothing but the best in your life for you and your family. Im sad to see you go, only because the time "we" shared has been so special. YNWA. Thank you Jürgen.
Well that’s my day ruined…. All the best Jurgen YNWA
You never walk alone! ❤
He gave us all his energy and time and he deserves to have some time off before going somewhere else and doing the same. he bought us success and hope and that's all we could ever ask for.
I blame the owners,Didn’t give him what he wanted!
This sucks. But I trust Jurgen's decision.
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
thank you jurgen :,) best times of my lives
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
YNWA
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 😢 but thank you jurgen wish you all the best whatever you do ❤❤❤❤
Why announce it in the middle of a season?😢
Now we need a last season to remember ❤
Who else wanted him to stay as long as Sir Alex stayed at United?!😭YNWA "Sir Klopp"❤
Thank you for everything, every bit of it, the whole journey! The wins, losses and everything else in between. YNWA 🕶
What a job klopp has done. We must have the right manager come in to build on the work klopp has done. Alonso would be great but is it too early for him or would he be willing should he win bundasligua?
Thank you Jürgen
You’ll never walk alone Klopp.
I cann't believe 😪🥹 it's shocking
Thanks for everything you have done for the club, for the team, the fans . Good luck for whatever you do in the future. Is it going to be Pep Vs Pep next season?
A Liverpool legend ❤
Sad day for LFC. But for me as a geman i hope he takes over the german national team.  And hell i hope for LFC they can get Xabi Alonso next year.
Gutting
😢
I was hoping this would be a joke but no am so sad😢😢😮 but ynwa JURGEN KLOPP❤
Klopp, thanks for everything ❤❤❤ YNWA
Thank you Kloop ❤ Legend
😭😭
Couldn’t keep up with pep
Oh, mate, Klopp's stepping down at the end of the season. End of an era, for sure. What a run he had with Liverpool – Champions League, Premier League, and all. Gonna miss his passion on the touchline. Wonder who'll take over the helm next.
It sound like a bomb... I'm so disappointed. Big thank for all u've donne for the club. I loved LFc before, I became a Jurgener Believer with u and I still love the club. God Bless you Jurgen. Ynwa from Burkina Faso west Africa.
Nooooooooooo 💔

Bayern Munich does it
My Couch ❤YNWA❤🎉🎉

Thank you for memories
This hurts a lot. What if Mo says he will leave  at the end of next season, coz it was Mane and Firmino last season, now it's Jurgen this season.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭
2024 gave me this. Holly cow
Irreplaceable ❤❤❤
Oh no. Anyway…
My country doesn't like football like other countries and only few people even play football here. I watched football from television in the mid 2010s, and fell inlove to the game. I attend camps and learn about the game, the moment I saw this club, I immediately fell inlove with it and supported it since. YNWA, Danke Jurgen!
It's so sad to see him go, it's been an amazing few years  and he has won it all for us. Thank you Klopp for everything  ❤️
YNWA
Jordan kllop ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Never left a YouTube comment before. Thank you for the memories Jürgen. YNWA❤
