I guess Sancho has been a flop, at least we have Garnacho to fire things up
Not having Reguilion are you ! , hope he proves you wrong . Cmon you Red Devils .
Mark a job well said,i know now that you have the inside scoop 😂🤣😂.But we are going to beat Arsenal "3 v 2 to  United and watch  Hojlund will score if they don't play as individuals and as a team,putting shots in the box for our up and coming star, Hojlund will burst a gut like  bruno and the balls he tries to get some one on the end of ( HOJLUND )Wat's his  name run muck Rasmus Hojlund.
Some pull Ten Hags b*lls out his throat!!!
Mark you are using too many words going back and forth. From your analysis you are sure man utd will lose. It's as simple as that, in your case. But you will be shocked. Man utd will play better
Truth is no matter how weak man utd is, we always give arsenal hell, but this time we are in a good shape. We can still get good points.
Arsenal will smash us. Ten hag doesnt give me confidence
United❤❤
We called off the Cucarella deal because Chelsea played and cup tied him.
Instead of playing Martial aka Sugar legs why dont we play Jadon in a false no.9. Martial has never been as good as he was since he first joined the club, he's passed it.
How can you be scared of arsenal they are mentally weak everybody thinks they are “world class” naaaah bro
Start rasmus hojland
ward prowse wouldve been a better replacement for erikson than mount
Welcome to supporting the most depressing team in the world
If fulham outbid utd fr amrabaat eth shd resign i would.
This has been a shocking transfer window however the only potential positive is that the Glazers are minimising their spending as the are finally preparing to sell!! Galzers OUT OUT OUT!!!
Mark, you said there players who follow your videos and programs. Do you think your negativity about some of these players help them build a coherent and confident team? If there is a 1% hope remaining  players  can become a better team, how this extreme negativity support them in increasing this percentage?
We are a sht of a club.
If they're worried about breaking the loan in january? Does that say the glazers are planning on being here in january?
Ten hag has to do something he hasn't done yet and that is beat a top 6 team away from home. I think Arsenal will win but i don't know how big of a margin. It could be a bad away day.
I love mark
Might as well not loaning any left back and use Fernandez
Hopefully the running of this club tanks the value massively, so Qatar or another super wealthy competitive owner can come in and buy the club easily.
You do realise he's not a Utd player yet!
If united get amrabat there's no way top 4 is realistic, his stats were awful at Watford, and he's been average at Fiorentina . He had a good WC thats it, statistically since then he's fell back in to average numbers. It's going to be another Mount signing, hype wit lh little out put.
Why is everyone on Eriksens case? Maybe not so much in this video  but in the last month or so it seems the feeling is he i is a second rank player 🤔I realise he is aging and i may be biased as a dane myself but he was more than integral  to last seasons results.
Mark do you think Fulham will sign Scott. Because utd would not have a enough time to sign a replacement
Hope the players heads dont  drop and play the game regardless of the situation at the club and give it their ALL.May the POWER be with MU. HERE WE GO MU>!!!!!!!!
Am I a member
Mark said that united are bad, that he doesn’t trust the team but then says a draw 😭😭 just be real pls 😂
Ten hag everyday of the week every week of the year artetas first season wasn't as good Eriks 😑🤌🏼🇿🇦
Mark's positivity/negativity balance is far more mature than it has been recently 😌🦔🇿🇦
Glazer's out full sale only
.
Now you are sounding like a hater bro take it easy🤐🙄
We are run like a midtable club now..looking for loan deals from the rejects of other clubs??as MANUTD we are supposed to buy best players of other teams not craps of other teams
Oh well this could of been a transfer window done before the transfer window shuts what a load of rubbish get rid of murtoh and Arnold
It becomes more and more apparent we will never be able to make progress with these owners. I can’t believe months ago the conversations we were having were if the takeover will happen in time for the new owners to work on this window. That seems like years ago now
I could really use some of this Mojo's , Mojo !! Whatever that may be 😅
United lose 4-1 to Arsenal on Sunday the team have gone backwards. So disillusioned by this club for the past 9 years. Every facet of this club has become shite
Mark making us click the video fully knowing we havent signed amrabat..
The squad this year is categorically better only because the squad last season was bad. We have improved, it's a fact. However we have not improved enough compared to our rival clubs so it will be difficult to have a better season than last season. The top 6 clubs have all had a better transfer window than us.
Roll on the end of this transfer window, maybe then the club will get sold maybe we were just avoiding a transfer embargo which can happen during a sale process in order to make a few average signings that we have managed
We should've signed Pavard, then we'd have another back up CB and LB
That ain't cucurella
Fulhams offered 30 mil for Amerabat
The Spurs hate is hilarious. Reguilón is now a “good player”. Why? Just because he left Tottenham? Because no one said he was good before yesterday
You’re right mark someone is going to give us a spanking. But I also think we aren’t far away from handing them out ourselves. We score as many as we concede under ten hag but that’s because of these occasional thrashings and no consistent no9.
7:23 I’ll help
Clearly these protests never work, there seem to be no urgency for the owners to leave or manage the club well. I think it's time to take this to another level, either empty o.t or pull a Liverpool in every home game. We need to hit where it hurt and make the sponsors think again.
At least we signed that young center back Johnny Evans...fml!!
I support one of the biggest clubs in the world but when it comes to transfers I feel like I support a bottom feeder
With the financial restrictions United are facing surely this is a wake up call for the owners to take the £5 billion bid on the table and sell up, it will never get any better under the current ownership
We're fucjed against arsenal.... Anthony Taylor is the ref.
6 united players in combined XI but crying about having weak team lollll
I really want Sancho starting on the right. Sancho looks better than Antony pre-season and off the bench.
Mark is the fake taxi dude
What good they have seen in Mason Mount knowing the fact that he underperformed last season in Chelsea.... Placing more importance on Mount over Amrabat just doesn't makes any sense very poor management😢
Looks like Amrabat is not coming
Also who has ten gag improved, just asking please give me answers??
Reguilón, do we have to go here? 😂
3-0 loss coming our way
maurits kjærgaard in winter would be a good addition
Want ten hag to succeed but what I don’t get is how Ange  de zerbi and Thomas frank can make a good team within months why are United worse than last season
The one thing I don't understand is. It's why doesn't ETH rate Donny now and want to try get his career back on track ?
Spurs did not even negotiate😂😂😂 they said to mufc you can take him for free😂😂😂😂
The 'beatings' Mark fears will come in the CL against Bayern, probably not against Arsenal.
Geoff here: For Fans " we are United"; for management " we are the untouchables".
It’s a literal joke that this club can’t finish anything needed to be competitive 🤷‍♂️
It has been a shitty and frustrating window. (Without the injuries) The weird thing is we might have the best squad since Ronaldo left.
Every united fans know.. we have alternative, option.... Cucu, regu, alonso
I dont know why reguilion is problem.. we signing 3rd  backup... He is not that bad
We are not going to win it’s that’s point blank.
Cuccarella played last night in the cup that's Potchy's fault, With him playing Cuccarella he's literally cup-tied our signing meaning Cuccarella wouldn't be able to play in the cup games so defeating the reason for buying him to play in all our games.
Its the hope that kills you. Fucking united hierarchy
United is truly shite… went to bed “Curcurella close”… woke up..Reguillon here we go”… 😮
What happens when onana goes away to afcon in January 😅
With the Cucurella deal falling through because United wanted to send him back in January an indication the Glazers have no intention of selling the club at all and are staying put. 😢
how on earth can martial still be starting away against arsenal, something wrong in this club
Arsenal wont humiliate United, they have themselves looked underwhelming like United have I think you guys will have an equal game with them Draw is actually very realistic
United are so inept who buys a $90 mil striker that can’t play
ETH never won against top team away.
Chelsea wanted 7milloin  loan fee
The worst part with the deadline day PR stunt is that Amrabat isn't even that good. In terms of quality I can't really distinguish between him and Mount. United is an absolute JOKE.😭
Yes people regulon very good mark just trying to back ETH up incase he's flop and then if he is banging as we all know he will be he can say ETH is magical manager lol bring in ole true fans should want a manager like Ole working under Eth to learn more tactical skills as he is very good man manager already and we need manager who loves club like Ole genuinely surly it's a united dream unfinished business
We will beat the drop  And survive  Gg mufc
We are definitely preparing for relegation
Regulon is proper decent player quick prem proven and durable at least,some will say better than corcular
Maguire will make his debut 😢
8 or 9 nil  I believe  ALL OUT NOW 😢
This club is probably the worst run business in the world only because of its name and what happened years ago it would be insolvent by now
Gizza loan …. The new Utd
No chance for Man Utd to win. If lucky, they will get a draw
Mark madrid looked at kepa
Tough game Sunday
Why not Vettai
I reckon mojo is that Nordic billionaire that wanted Utd at some point
There’s a lot of Thursday night football coming.  I don’t think we will finish top four again under Glazers.
Come on reds we were so unlucky at the Emirates last season
Regullion is made of glass. He missed 29 games for Atleti and Simeone never rated his defensive skills.
Easy win for United
How van gaal was right must be thinking ten hag
Shambles of a show this one
I knew it about amrabat, and now we’ve given Liverpool a good product that ten hag could have made an exciting midfielder, we’re done until we’re sold! How can they do a window like this and still expect 6 billion ! GLAZERS OUT! Get games cancelled!!!
The Glazers are clinging on to this club for dear life. But they can't afford to stay, if they don't sell in the next year. The club will eventually be taken off their hands when the debt collectors come calling.
HOJLUND will not play
😂😂😂😂 4:05… I peed a little laughing so hard at this 😂😂
We’ve got 99 problems and the Manager ain’t one 😡 😂 Reguillon I don’t care if I’ve spelled it wrong is the kick in the Balls I’ve been waiting for all week.
Arsenal make every team play well at the emirates
i swear the hoops and turmoil this club goes through every transfer window is the best entertainment
Bro that is too harsh on Regulion,,,he s not that bad as your making it out,,,, unbelievable
Mason Mount got the winning assist in a Champions League Final. He basically dragged Chelsea to that trophy along with Thiago Silva and Kante. You lot have short memories, there’s a fantastic player there.
Mojo needs to buy United
Hi Mark, I always respect your opinions but when Reguillion played for Spurs under Mou he was very good for them...other Managers have not used him for whatever the reason....Didnt we try to sign Reguillion in the past...I get it he has not been picked by Spurs but defensively hes better than Cucurella...I would have even prefer a different player but it is what it is.
Sorry Mark! United will get their ass kicked very badly at Emirates.
Regulon is obviously not that good if United only want to keep him till January
I can’t imagine the club ever getting sold
We didn't turn down cuccurella because of that, we turned him down cause fucking played yesterday and thats hqlf the games we would have probably used him for gone
He thinks Rashford is over martinelli🤣 and seriously considered Bruno over odeegard initially 🤣 that is blind and delusional.
Please learn to pronounce reguillon’s name right 😭😂  “Regwillon” 😂😭😂😭😂😭
Tbh I dnt see where Sancho fits in this season with Rashy and Ganacho on the left and Antony and Pellestri off the right and Martial and Hojlund up top
With Niklas Fulkrug now signing for BVB I would try to get Youssef Moukoko from BVB and let Sancho return to Dortmund
Reguiillon to score the winner on sunday? Youd love to see it 😂
Mark that 17 on your Hoijlund shirt looks a little silly now 👀
Arsenal are gonna win
I think after the transfer window has closed, that we shouldn't even mention Harry Maguire's name. He doesn't even exist anymore.
We will lose 4-0
Henderson Out. (£20m?) Mengi Out. (£?) Fred Out. (£10m?)  Surely thats enough to cover Amrabat between £22-26m?? Baffles me the business we do or don't do.
I've no idea who the new goalkeeper is, but I hope he's decent, because he's going to be busy in January.
Pellistri, Mejbri not going on loan what about Alvaro Fernandez I think Ten Hag will have to reconsider the plans for him!
We create chances but can't score ,relying on midfielders,  kane was must have signing,  murtar ,mctominay, maguire,  Man u don't need m,   just utd from now on
I don't think Reguilon is that bad, but I'd have preferred Cucurella as he can play across the back 4 and if he'd worked out he could've saved Qatar "hopefully" a few million quid next summer!
Gh
You never know which United is going to turn up anymore. Fearing the worst, we'll get pumped 4-1. Ar best, we'll scrape a 1-1 draw.
The club is just finished,I'm done with all this nonsense tbh
Fred is ten times better than mc tomminay,  Brazil International who qualify for the world Cup vs Scotland International who qualify for nothing,  selling fred will be our biggest mistake,  bring fred on at75 min to see the game out , just his smile must cheer up the lads , mctominay is a miserable b turd
How did this fella pick arteta over ten haag losing faith already
How 6 united players are making the combined eleven is ridiculous
Best thing us united fans can hope for is 5th. We're in for a shambolic season because ten hag hasn't been fully backed
Cucurella is the better transitional fullback, Regulon looks like a fullback that crosses more, i think hes had a really bad groin injury too we can only hope has an insane 1/2 season.
What a joke of club we are!!!
The owners are American.  They are turning Man U into the Oakland A's, it's just like watching the movie Moneyball
Manchester United sadly reminds me of Michael Jackson, living off reputation on what made him great, a lot like M U! We’re dead true n true and I don’t believe I support the same club anymore 😢
Rashford is fast but can’t pass and shoots from anywhere Martinelli is fast skill full gets goals and assists and helps the defence No contest
We signed amrabat?
The amrabat that Fulham have just bid for...🙈
Left overs FC
I'm holding out hope that the Glazers are being frugal and trying not to spend further as they are handing over the reigns in a sale to Qatar - pleeeeez 🙄🙏
I remember he wanted Reguilon back in the days and now he saying he is sh*t lol
I think Mount will be the 12th player in the squad.  In theory he's a bench player but as soon as someone from Eriksen all the way up to the wing needs a break or is underperforming he'll come in and fill the position well.
❤
we are finished club, we signed the worst LB in the premier league
The best we've got? It's all we've got.
Such a broken window and the Glasers wont fix it......
Glazers are selling in January, this is why they aren’t willing to invest this window.
"Never fear! Richard Arnold is here!" - Mark Goldbridge, describing the terrible transfer season, 2023
Mount is not an upgrade on eriksen! Stop saying that it’s an insult to eriksen
Tony Martial will be subbed off at 60 minutes, so Rasmus could come on then.
There can be only one
We pull off an upset Sunday, I can see it coming
How is it different with Ten Hag ? His away record is worst than any manager we had
Every season City get an easy group in the champions league.Why is it every season?something doesn't seem right to me
I think Reguilon will be decent me I'm not sure what the negativity surrounding Regulion is about tbh he was great at spurs a couple years ago for whatever reason fell out of favour went to athletico didn't get the gametime I think it's a harmless loan could be decent and I think he will be....personally
Delot starts calm down hes better than brandon williams
Regulion is a decent signing in the circumstances with the left back crisis, but overall this window has been one of the worst I can remember. Shared blame in my opinion, Ten Hag and the board not prioritising key signings.
man said arsenal have a better team then puts in 6 united players lol
United transfers are like going to a firework display thinking it would be great but all you get is sparklers
Transfer window is almost over, than God
80 million a season in interest payments … no payment of the actual debt itself.  It’s scary .. also why are the glazers and board so worried about a player leaving in January if they are selling - it worries me! 😮
Can’t believe we’ve lost Gravenberch to liverpool could’ve easily got a swap deal for mctominay done there and still got Amrabat over the line. Can see Reguillion actually doing Ok under ten Haag, quick gets down the wings and Hojlund to cross the ball to might allow us to increase our tempo down the flanks and create a bit more with a faster tempo
Saliba odegard decent???
Utd win 😊
We will win Arsenal ate bottlers
I don’t think we will have our ass handed to us … everyone thought that last season when arsenal were unbeaten and we won so have faith lads!!!
When is there going to be a video saying reguilon here we go 😊
Garnacho.....    Hoijland ......Pellestri....Let's go ⚽️😊😊😊..
I hope ETH can prove me wrong with his transfers but I would rather have  gotten gravenberch and amrabat instead of mount
Angry MARK
Why do i watch this channel again......all i see the bad new after bad new
Glazer out
The reality is that a club begging for emergency signings is not in the top 4...
I'm convinced some of Tus members who make super chats are literally 12 yrs old.
Glazers out
You don't like MU but ......
If we don’t step up in clog up the massive holes in midfield they will slice us to bits
We started to slow last season and we are to slow at starting this season.
Ambrabat wsn't  in Manchester yet but he will play against  Arsenal 😂😂😂people are thick🤭
This club makes me sick we got Regullion over cucurella not happy at all joke of a club
I’ll take Amadou Onana over Ryan Gravenberch
Amrabat will be done tomorrow
Poor Mark. He has no idea when something goes wrong for him. So self opinionated his mind  is closed
Without amrabat ,arsenal would eat united sunday
AWB OVER BEN WHITE IS ABSOLUTELY CRIMINAL, I RESPECT MARK A LOT BUT THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE
Unpopular opinion but I would rather give a surprise debut to Dan Gore.  I think he has that leadership mentality to step in like Maino would. Afterall he is the captain. I have a funny feeling we might see Hannibal.
Is Hojlund even training?
Play rasmus, martial is terrible
somberbridge
Should trust the kid at left back, he’s a United player. If not then sell him
Trashing incoming 4-0.😢
Amrabatt ain't coming to United
Scooby Doo and a packet of crisps
Actually Prefer listening to Beth, doesn’t complain endlessly about everything. Must have such high blood pressure
No way Rashford is better than Martinelli in this world.
I still believe we can get a result. My common sense says otherwise, but I still have a shred of belief left, because of ETH.
5-0 incoming.🙈🙈🙈🙈🤡
You keep moaning just support city
Nop I wouldn’t play Erikson no way
I get that mctominay is not good enough for united but its not his fault that united are asking 40 mil for him which no one is willing to pay!!
This transfer window stresses United fans more than any maths equation
Marky boy
Why are we constantly surprised with the way we conduct business in the transfer market 😂 its united after all watch as we make a panick flop buy. That dude from spurs Regulion 😂 got destroyed by that 16 year old Yamal
Reguillon is worse than Cucurella ffs this club has fallen off.
No
He is better than cuc he will be good for us I prefer Reg any day
Reguilon😂 we are officially DONE! My prediction is another youth player will step up and the fans will think he is the next superstar....
Wow Mark was so harsh on Reguilon. He was amazing @ Sevilla alot of top clubs wanted him. Spurs ruined him & I have faith ETH will discover his best football 🤞🏾
It's the perfect game for Arsenal.
Poverty FC ffs this club stresses me out
Arsenal four United nil
It another sad day for Manchester United. Glazers out
1st
