went to this match remembered Freds goal ever since
u know ronaldo did nothing that game right
I miss Ronaldo Man Utd should be ashamed
👍🏻
Greenwood ruined his career. He could of been a legend
Who's here after the tables have turned, this time crystal palace won
Still the best 30 minutes Man Utd have played all season.
I thought Telles’ and Dalot’s performances were sensational. RED ARMY
Sheesh freds a goat
Sleep,,d,d,fm I bought these two new ones I bought
1:11
1:34
I am Manchester United fan
Ronaldo
Fred
Fred has more goals then messi this season btw
Fred before the goal: meme Fred after the goal: FREDEMPTION!!!
Fred gets undermined by us so much but  if he gets that much stick from us I think Mctominay should
Telles was brilliant
Fred is better than Ronaldo
Fred dead redemption this man has come alive for Ralf
2:45 Watch Ronaldo clap....you can even hear it..as he knows that ball is hitting the back of the net.  Click again or you'll miss it.  It's like he's been waiting for his team mates to do stuff like that.   I suspect now you have a German at the wheel at least some things will change Kloppo was right about this guy.   Im a Liverpool fan but here scouting the new enemy as to be expected, only healthy!
Me when I saw the thumbnail: 😳                                              Also me after watching the match: 😅
rangnick really is a genius
what a GOAL by Fred!
IT’SSS FREEEEEEEEDDDD!!! Gives me shivers icl , noone expected it 😭😭
Freds a decent player not class but not terrible, but all those fans calling him, sancho, maguire etc out are the same ones in these comments saying they have always rated Fred and how good he is after a couple of games its so funny 😂next will be sancho
Calm down lads its only palace
Alex telles is underrated
Looks like he found his Brazilian passport just in time.
Congrats!
Everyone’s acting like he’s amazing 😅😅😅😅 first good games he’s ever had . Sad United fans
Fred did this plenty at Shaktar in the CL, he just hasn't been allowed the freedom to attack in recent seasons.
What was ronaldo trying to do when Fred shot?
still trending
I’ve watched this over 5 times
Telles is quality
Bloody hell has Fred done something decent for once
Crazy how everyone rates Fred all of a sudden
Feels like I’m watching a Championship fixture. Gotta love Gary Weaver. 🎤
jesus christ...was expecting an absolute worldy from the reports ive seen/read, thats looks like he meant to cross it to ronaldo but put to much on it and fluked it in
To think Dalot and Telles were frozen by Ole just to play his favourite players ( bissaka and Shaw) , that is sackable mistake. how on earth was Ole playing out of form Bissaka and Shaw when we had Dalot and Telles who are naturally attacking fullbacks. ?
I mean all Ralf could do was instill a formation, play his players in their favoured positions and alter their mentality. Result: we didnt concede hardly any chances from counter-attacks from one of the best counter attackin teams in the prem. Consistency is the hardest thing n its now key. To keep the momentum goin, i wudnt change the team too much vs Young Boys.
RAGNICK will improve players like Telles Dalot Sancho Fred. He has a proven record of this.
Dvb/pogba over Scott Dalot need to start
This has to be goal the month
Meant dallo auto correct
Dalloway on fire
United we do united we do united we do oh united we love yyyoooouuuu
Ronaldo ❤️
I hope Man U fans aren’t getting excited with their new manager about narrowly beating an average bottom half Palace team 😂 The way they talk about their team, they should be beating palace by 3 or 4 goals at least. Even with Ole they would have at least beat that palace team by one goal 🤷🏻‍♂️
Fred really is Brazilian
Rangnick making McFred semi competent Wow
Hahaha calm down all of a sudden he's a genius lmao Reality check it's Crystal Palace at home..
fred officially has more premier league goals than messi, haaland, mbappe and lewandowski combined. absolute class
What was the odds Fred scoring the only goal? 100000 to 1 ?
Dalot has been absoloutely terrific recently, should start over wan-bissaka imo
Big match for the start
rangnick ball simply isn't moving the needle...hassenhutl 2.0
The fact that Mike phelan is still in the coaching staff is just embarrassing
I know many United fans dont like him, but Fred has been one of the hardest working players for United. Hard work pays off. Having a manager with a plan also helps.
That is embarrassing
that ball to the face from casemiro restarted his brazilian football skills
All of a sudden everyone is Fred’s number 1 fan and acting like they weren’t saying he’s a joke two weeks ago
Lucky to scrape a 1-0 win against palace at home
He really has casemiro wonder touch . I hope his form continues
Love how’s there no video from anyone trying to criticise Ralf. They know from one game what he’s about
Palace were totally outplayed most of the game!!
why’d ronaldo try catch it
I was at this
Since ole left freds woken up......to a point that pogbas gunna have to work hard to get back in the team
Congrats folks salute big up Fred the red‼️💣🗣💯
Fred is the most useless and weak player
Good ole Fredinho
I still prefer him as the mascot
Nothing special here people acting like UNITED where going to won 7-0 ffs lol you all hyped up Ole and Carrick just relax
I placed a bet for £10 to get £220 for Fred to score and the bet didnt place 💔
Ragnick making even Fred play well. Who knew
Looks like uniteds new game plan is to just hit shots from outside the box
So now everyone loves Fred? You Man Utd fans come so different 😂😂
Oh god Fred had a good game big wow 1 game dosnt prove anythink haha.
Fred s goal from outside the box ----WOW
They've got everyone actually making decent shots. Mason Greenwood passing. Fred actually shooting and scoring. What kind of inspiration has he given them. Lmao
CR 7 is magical
I simply cannot understand WHY United cannot thump them 10 nil....jez Look at the squad we have...even without Cavani out frontline is OUTTA this world.
Ronaldo's body language when it's not him that scores is sad to watch.
Chcieliście wyjebać Freda ? Teraz Fred wyjebał was ;-)
Even Fred was surprised it went in !
What an enjoyable match to watch, good vibes coming from the new man in charge.
Just asking cuz I seem to have forgotten but where is pogba?? Injured ?
Fred playing good nowadays
yes, united are back, hammering the giants of palace at home we're on the march. with games against class teams such as Norwich, Burnley, Newcastle, Watford, Southampton, Leeds, Everton, Villa & Brighton these will create a false sense of security, like it did last season, in order for the media to hype the delisional fans into a frenzy for when they fail to beat the top 6 sides.... again..... Rangy at the wheel!
Red has scored more goals for United this season than Harry kane
Fredinho carrying us to the UCL title this year!
They played the German way , every player have the opportunity to score . Well done .
Cmon Fred
So happy for Fred...The guy's taken a lot of stick from Utd fans (from me included), but he always gives 100%. Loving Dalot & Telles...they both appear to have real quality going forwards whilst switching on to their defensive duties. Hope Shaw & AWB don't walk back into the team!
Fred has easily been United's best player past 4 games without a doubt
calm down it’s only Palace you should be beating them 4 - 0, have you seen Man Us next 10 fixtures😂? they’re games they would be winning without Rangnick anyway
man utd scores 1 goal = reds fans get excited LOL  Manchester City Scores 3 Amazing Goals = whole world stands up in awe and claps 👏🏻 *Man City for 2022 Premier League Champions*
Manchester United is very small club.
Frediniho
Sorry Fred ur the king of football u deserve a ballon dor
Darlow??
I was at the game, and United still have a lot to do. Some outstanding performances from Teles and Fred, but for me Dalot was the man of the match. Defended brilliantly and pressed well down the right when needed. Ronaldo, Rashford and Sancho were disappointing, step it up fellas. Lets hope Ralph can get the best out of his squad of stars. RED ARMY!!!!
Jimmy Mac is sorely missed.
I thought they would have called CR7 offside for deceiving the keeper
YES FRED THIS IS WHY HE IS IN MY ULTIMATE TEAM
Crystal Palace ffs
Yes well done Fred but please keep consistent like CR7 if this is just for the new manager to see …. We’ll he’s in trouble
Ralf Rangnick OUT!!
McKenna, Fletcher and Phelan must’ve told him to stick with McTominay and not sub on VDB until the 85th minute
Can tell that ole has left. Fred is literally fighting for his position now and it shows. Can see the foney united fans beginning to change their tune after hes had a couple of decent games.
fred is the goat its obvious
Fredinho finally found his Brazilian passport 👏🏽
Its only crystal palace. They get excited and get a top team and get slapped back to reality again. Mark my words
Maguire and McTominay the weak links
One star weak foot to a 5-star weak foot
they are being a bit more sensible with their shots and making sure that they can get a good shot off. Played very well
best 1-0 man utd have played in a long time
Fred man of match go Fred
Give the man the ballon dor 😂
Another false dawn
Wtf, Ronaldo self hands slap at Fred's shot like a kid! 😂
Fred🤯🤯🤯
Fred finally realised he’s Brazilian
Get in there Fred my guy
This Fred geezer has been in the news alot this season.
Fred realising he’s been used the wrong foot all these years
Here we go again. Is Fred going to be the next Brazilian super star ,stay were you belong hoovering near 4th spot 😆
All the years we’ve talked only negative about Fred, but that’s a screamer
1:27 _”Diego…wooahh. He came from Uruguay. He made the scousers cry”_ lol 😂 magic that’s still sung.
Fred with a banger 💥
(right) said Fred
Good god he done something right at last.
great performance. hopefully we can start scoring a few more.
Fred! 👏
Rangnick shouldn't have taken off Sancho. Rashford was the weak link. Drop McT!  We played well, but we are known for getting a new lease of life right after a new manager joins.  The opposition wasn't the best. Let's see how the team plays in a few months from now when the manager has enough time to make his mark on the team. 👣
i was in the staditiom.
None of this puts ole in a good light, both carrick and ragnick have got the team playing better.Same players, different team, did they really think that little of him or did he just say don’t bother closing players down and play as a unit. Baffling
Your editor still needs firing.
Imagine being a new manager and the first player to score for you is called Fred.
Go my man fred lad !! Making up for them mistakes
Last week you all wanted rid of Fred. 🥴
Haha love the morons saying United are now a different team and Fred has been completely changed. They beat Crystal Palace 1-0 and Fred has  had an average game. Calm down.
WHAT A GOAL WHAT A PLAYER CONSISTENCY IS THE PROBLEM
Well done
Fred did something good
Fred with an amazing goal, been playing amazing these past games, United as a team playing a lot better with a lot more chances and playing making scenarios into play!❤️
all these fred fans just rose from the dead
Fred is gonna be like sabitzer at leipzig
Fred looks a different player at the moment, being given the freedom to play more like a number 8 than always CDM. I think we will see the best of Fred under Ralf
Funny how Ole and Rangnick both had confidence in FRED !
Well at least one team in Manchester can beat Palace 🤣
Cool 😎
You can tell from telles's reaction that he couldn't believes that Fred had sent the ball into the net lol
United should sell fred because the good performance against crystal palace and the decent performance against arsenal isn't enough to cover up the crappy performances  since he came to united.For me to say that he is what united needs,he has to be on his game for the rest of the season.
Fred’s found his Brazilian passport
Ragnarok is coming
Fred,Telles,Dalot all of them 3 looked wonderful recently
Deffo a cross that goal
Of all people 🤣
Red Fred Redemption
Honstly. First time for a long time I have enjoyed a mufc game. From the start the players were on it. 2nd half you can tell the steam was running out. But we have to Remmber that RR only had 1 training session with them. Just think we're we be in a couple of weeks time. Lots to improve but it's a good start.
FRED. ole unearthed a gem. LolololoL. 😂😂😂♥️
Fred's been a beast since Ole left. Apart from the last minute  chance against Chelsea haha
1 decent goal and everyone thinks hes a top flight baller lol
Dalot and Telles 🔥 Porto providing good full backs to the Devils 💙
Let me say this one more time. Olly was a good player but he was not a good manager. End of.
any one else notice ronaldo not celebrating the goal
Fred for balon d’or 2023
Rangnick aka thanos will get humbled very soon 😂😂
Back in the title race 🤦🏻‍♂️💀  oh dear lord
I don't think it's the manager. The players didn't play for Olly until he was sacked. Cruel but shows players control everything
It took 5 years fred to score a goal finally he has ..he wont sleep tonight..🤣🤣
Brilliant goal Fred 👏🏽
How can people say this rangnick if a football genius if they didn’t know who he was 2 weeks ago
Fred found his birth certificate and released he’s Brazilian
CR7 offside?
I see some Liverpool movements in united.
Fred, now has more goals than Messi and Kane. Lol.
Utd were playing at the same level as a man city, Liverpool Chelsea in the first 30 mins, after that they very obviously got really tired and kinda went back to playing how they did under ole. Still really positive though and deserved the win
My man's got a result out of Fred, can't wait to see what he's got in store for us!
Telles and Dalot both brilliant today aswel
FRED THE RED
1-0 against palace and the mancs are world beaters🤣😂 If your man Ralf is the best coach ever to have existed where’s all his trophy’s?
They looked so impressive, im glad to see this side of united and ovbs for the players that havent been starting will see more game time, ive said it from day one telles makes shaw look dogwater! Telles all day long for me! Shaw needs to go!
Let us be clear about something. It’s amazing how everything going with Man Utd can show the human behaviour, in some cases in its worst shape of negativism, impatience and criticising chaos. I felt today people were on the edge to turn on the manager again which is ridiculous giving that this is his first game. Also not many think what it means to be a player of Man Utd and the amount of pressure associated with it. You can’t make 11 copies of Roy Keane unfortunately. People differ. Say what you want about Maguire but he is mentally strong, and when challenged physically he defends, speed and accuracy issues but he can surely defend. Fred is in constant move which creates sloppy mistakes but he keeps the dynamics shifting and he might be covering the most areas. I can see today Fred is a hero but you also have to support these players on their messy days/months to boost their confidence.
Fred so on form right now I love it
Right said Fred
Almost looks like Ronaldo tries to catch Fred’s shot 😂
literally said 4222 is the way to go
That’s what happens when you play Fred in the right position, same position for Brazil and he’s highly rated in the National squad 🤷🏻‍♂️ glad to see him doing well, he’s always had the heart and workrate !!
That wasn't Fred. That was Rodriguez.
Ayew should've at least hit the target. we didn't play well enough but still should've got a point.
Fredaldinho is back
Red Fred Redemption
FRED ARMY
Ronaldo distracted the keeper with a huge clap?
Red Fred Redemption
About time Fred turned up !
Já tá fazendo mais que o Anderson fez durante anos no Manchester rsrs top Fred
The football was mint to watch
Fred be banging a hatrick in the next game!
Fred has his Brazilian passport
The Fredator 💀👊
Imagine if he wraped that into top corner
I dislike fred but what a Goal son
Ralf Rangnick era begins with a victory and clean sheet. Alhamdulilah. ❤️
Manu already look a lot more proactive and creative on the attack. Even though it was a close game score wise Manu put a lot of pressure on palace throughout
Wait till united play teams who will run at defence. Nothing has changed, only fans seem very excited
Telles should've played it to Greenwood with that free kick. He had space to run into. A well weighted pass and greenwood could've taken a touch and just hit it cleanly.
I'm so happy that ralf wasn't completely satisfied he said we should have had more goals and the team had back passes that shows how detailed and professional he is
COME ON!!! WHAT A DAY TO BE BACK AT MY HOME OLD TRAFFORD!!! GGMU FOREVER!!! 🔴❤️👹
Ronaldo never celebrates when other members of the team score, just stands there like a lump
A bit of Brazilian magic !
Better performance,
United fans getting gassed. Won’t last long
I think the permier league likes swabians its now the 3. Swabian Coach 🤣
Lionel Freddi
i take it Man Utd had no Penalty shouts then... as it ended only 1-0
I knew fred was going to be great with rangnick
Imagine Man Utd win the league
As long as Fred and Harry the hoover still start the top 4 have nothing to fear.....
Rangnick got Fred to play well   😀 Alex Ferguson <rangnick
Nobody else notice Ronaldo thought about pushing it away with his hands because it had gone over him? Or did i completely misread that 🤔
Fred could of scored 3 over head kicks an a bicycle kick today and I'd still say get him out an get someone proper instead. He's not a United player
Why’s nobody talking about how well Dalot performed today great performance from the Portuguese youngster
1 million views in 6 hours 🐐🐐
WTF was Ronaldo doing? Trying to play volleyball?
And Ralf didn’t play Martial… he has sense..
Played a completely different game today, always moving, always attacking, not just sitting back and waiting for the counter. Reminds me of the old Fergie United, Ralf has barely been there but can already see what this team is going to do. Ralf invented his own complete style of playing that many have adopted including Klopp, imagine what he will do now. Let's hope it all goes to plan and he works his magic.
Anyone else notice Ronaldo just clapping before the goal went in???
2:55 Surely he was offside right?
I didnt know fred could kick the ball, thats insane
GeT DoNnY On
1 million views in 6 hours😳
It’s telling that pogba always gets criticised when he plays and we lose or draw but when ole got sacked the games around that time he wasn’t playing was he still to blame lol
This manager is good
Probably the 1st times Fred's done anything Brazilian in his life!
Don’t see Fred do that a lot
Calm down its only palace 😂
One day they hate you love you the next😪
I mean man City lost 2-0 to crystal Palace so...
Bread gets too much stick, not fair!!!
fred having one decent game in years and people acting like hes the next ballon dor winner lmao
Ragnick has managed to make Fred score he should stay
lets all calm down....under Ole at the beginning Utd played good football. watch these players throw ralf under the bus too
What's happened to Fred this week been eating his spinach this week..
Ronaldo offside and distracting the keeper when Fred shoots. Lucky not to be disallowed.
Good to see the new manager off to a winning start, seems like a nice bloke.
come back OLE  all is forgiven  the players miss your 'friendship'      YNWA
Casamero definitely has knocked something into fred
Fred finally found his brazilian passport. been cooking for past few games
I love Fred so much and I'm a Stoke fan
Ralfs at the wheel
That's the difference between a manager and an ex player that thought he was a manager.
MONSTRO
Palace are having a rough patch down to missing to key players in the new setup under Viera. This is their 3rd loss in a row after 7 unbeaten. United should have finished this off 3 or 4-0. Not much to be positive about for either side.
All United fans having been b!itching about fred for ages now hes got you 6 points in two games lol
@skysports can you PLEASE start putting the minutes on the highlights? So people who couldn't watch the match can know how early we starting attacking, what half we scored ect..
Fred again
Fred again
Disgusting how all the Manchester United fans treated Fred
Is it just me but Fred’s been on fire in these past few weeks🔥🔥🔥
Commentator saying darlow when it’s Dalot 🤦‍♂️
Man like Fred
Fred again
Right said Fred !
Ralph’s at the wheel
Dalot n telles giving shaw n AWB something to worry about
Unbelievable
Fred finally found out his Brazilian after seeing Lucas Moura score a banger
If ayew volleyes that he cant miss surely...
Lovely to see Dalot a Porto born and bred player who came through our youth academy finally getting a chance as United’s starting right back and seeing Telles, our best player when he was at Porto and such a massively adored player by all our fans finally also getting a chance and starting regularly! Nice to see the two Porto boys playing side by side at fullback at one of the best teams in the world and doing well!
Everyone's praising Rangnick so much. It's just 1-0. Against Crystal Palace. At home.  Not saying he can't be good, but don't get your hopes up too early.
I’ve backed Fred all the way even after that Leicester FA Cup game and he’s paying my faith in him back. Been unbelievable for 4 games in a row
I was so scared thinking that we would draw
Maybe Fred is Brazilian🤨
Fred the 🐐
Lionel fred
Fluke
Fred > Ronaldo
Sir Alex must sit watching games thinking I must of been even better than I thought
Well played
Crystal Palace only beat big clubs
Fred is another man. Telles and Dialo are good players who were seldom used. We seldom see MU dominate the game with so many shots.
FREDINHO ON FIRE 🔥
Ayyy Fred waved at meeee
I honestly think in terms of attacking the players were told not to shoot unless you are within the width of the 6 yard box. Which explainable why Rashford, Greenwood etc were not trying to scored from ridiculous positions.  In terms of pressing i think the 2 forwards Ronaldo and Rashford  plus 2 cdms Fred Mctominay were told to press when opposition had the ball in central area , whilst full backs and attacking mids were told to cover wide areas.
If this is what it’s like with no Varane or pogba, then I’d love to see what it would be like with them.
Did ya'll see Ronaldo jumped with his hands 🤣 distracted the keeper  ❤ Ronaldo i swear🇯🇲🇬🇧 lets win next game. Well done team✔ listened to the manager very well
Lol, see this is what happens when you use strategy and tactics. Shows how bad their last manager was
Ole back in for me
He might HV a Brazilian passport after all
Stunner !
If Rangnick does one thing - turn Fred into a decent player - he will have been a successful manager
Oh Fred.... so happy for him. So good to see the boys pressing and upping their game already - deserved 3 or 4 goals! Watching Telles dance with Fred on repeat
1-0 against Crystal Palace? Is that it? Doesn’t show much of an instant improvement does it
that was the best football that united played in a while good pressing fred been united best player in the last game 3 and this one too i love his energy high pressing as well with fred playing under rangnick is gonna be something special
GERMAN QUALITY!
Fred the next Iniesta 🐐
2 more consistent games and then Fred is on my list of certified players! What a guy, I hope he continues his amazing form
One of the most boring games I've seen in a while! The highlights should of just been Fred's goal
With the way dalot is playing, awb would find it difficult to get back into this team
good finish, but Guaita splitstep way too late
United looking dangerous for once
I know Fred isn’t the best but he puts the most effort in on the pitch even when he’s having really bad games so I’m glad to see him score
3 players i want to see play under rangnick 1. Donny Van De Beek 2. Alex Telles 3. Diogo Dalot
fred for ballon d'or
Dalot is showing how bad wan bissaka is going forward completely different having someone how can dribble ,cross and pass
The whole team was compact and solid, controlling the game, recovering lost possession, that was one fine display just lacking goals. And did anyone recognized how effective Maguire was with his long balls distributions?...damn the coming weeks look good already...GGMU
United played their socks off but Ayew should of made that ..
fredinho has returned
that's our first clean sheet for 6 years
Haha you honestly can’t right it… bloody Fred! 😂
A lot of the Fred slender from the start was illogical. He was almost never dropped by Ole or Carrick. Obviously he’s showing something in training and in the dressing room that the others aren’t. I think he was a scapegoat. It was hard for him to look good when the players had stopped running for Ole.
Gerrard has more PL wins than “the puppetmaster” ragnick 😂😂😂 Ralf the fraud
Only wins 1-0 lol 😂
Different scorers since Ole left
Fred is now becoming Brazilian
Before: lingardinho Now: fredinho
Dear commentator  His name is not Darlow, his name is Dalot.
Freddo
McTominnay getting found out that he's the weak link in that partnership
Surprise surprise Fred is playing well when he’s played in the correct position.
No one is talking about ayews miss
This style of play probably suits Fred. Quick and hectic. 😆
What a start for Rangnick! It can only get better from here! GGMU
Sancho left out again? Baffling. Absolutely baffling.
So at home to Crystal Palace you play a 4-5-1??? 😂
Dalot and telles so much better going forward than awb and shaw
Hope he gets rid of pogba
Fred > prime Fred
United fans thinking they've got another version of Klopp for a manager.  He's got no charisma, his team barely beat a poor palace side
Fred remembering hes a proffesional football player, you love to see it
Its not about the goal. See how they were playing.  A well structured team
This Ralf guy is quickly becoming the most overrated coach just in 2 games.
Fred will be a united legend
Lucky as always
Some one thinking 🤔 fred is 🐐 goat 🐐 🤣🤣🤣 lol
will the big six return
Fred literally plays like crap one match, takes out his own keeper then scores , next match scores a worldie . as a footie fan i kinda like this, as a liverpool fan yeah im not worried. well played united enjoyed the match
Great performance by FRED, but really wonder why CR7 stretched his both hands during the shot, in a similar way a brilliant goal of Dybala got cancelled last year, luckily the ball passed without touching hands, (2:44-2:47), anyways, back to back win for MU and hope to see CR7 in the scoresheet in the next match against Norwich City.  :)
What a goal expect big things from united 💪🏻
Up the freddd laaad
What a goal 🔥
dalot is so underrated, deserve to be our first rb
Fred?
Cult hero Fred!😂😂
2:46 anyone else see how Ronaldo clapped his hands? Maybe to distract the keeper or he was already celebrating the goal xD
It took Ralf one training session to implement his ideas. Dominating possession, intensity, high pressing and patterns of play. Goes to show what you can do when you have a manager with a clear idea and plan. Big shout out to Fred too who’s been unplayable past few games despite all the stick. He’s now being utilised properly like he does for Brazil as a box to box midfielder. He carries the midfield on his own when he has McTominay next to him who goes missing and offers nothing. Now we have a clear plan and way of playing the crap players are being found out. Big mention for Dalot and Telles too.
Fred scoring makes ole look smart 😂
Can't believe I'm saying this but... Well done Fred your starting to look like the player we were raving about when the club first signed him..
Fred in the last 2 games..injured the goalie, assisted to Bruno , won penalty in Arsenal game, and now win the game.
People forgetting he used to be a cam
telles, bruno and ronaldo look like brothers
A late goal against mighty Palace. Bravo
I’m making bold statement Fred will triumph under rangniik
Its hard to believe this is the same time that played under ole
Gonna be really interesting soon as to what goes off at Manchester United.
Manchester get these anonymous players you never know even played for Man U. It’s kinda wott
Said it before one man isn't gona fix man utd. The players are to blame.
Honestly, good for him. I’ve slated him relentlessly for ages, but I do think there’s a player in there. Hopefully Ralf can bring it out.
Celebrating like that after scoring to beat a team with 3 wins this season and more losses than all clubs above bottom 3 🤣 literally the definition of joke
🤣 So hold on, did Crystal Palace really have one chance the whole game? I understand why Klopp wasn't very happy that Rangnick signed a deal with United..
Absolutely well deserved
Frediniho
Are Shaw and AWB injured?
Yeah utd played well...but palace are not all that tho... What if Ayew put that in?
Fred remembered he’s Brazilian
Fred who
Nah, can we all just take a moment to appreciate the volume level of Ronaldo's clap before Fred's shot hit the back of the net? 2:46
The fact that this game was not  on sky on a sunday is a disgrace !!!
Watch all the utd fans start raving about how good fred is now. Lol
Just glad we beat the arsenal. That's a major plus in the season. Muppets
HE S FRED
Fred has now scored 1. Assisted 2. And earned 1 penalty for utd in the last 2 games
No Shaw and no AWB am definitely we have first clean sheet..  Telles and Dalot 🔥
Fred again
What sort of parallel universe have we entered?!
Ralf has already brought so much, including Freds lost brazilian passport.
Minus the mistakes, Fred is a decent player
don’t sleep on Fred !
I'm not getting carried away because ole won 5-0 in his first game.  What I will say is I was happy that we played with a high line and kept passing forwards instead of backwards and sideways all the time
Nice to see manager actually on the touch line after one game they need to play for someone and have fear solskgaer was more there mates
Dalot is a class player
Fred does make mistakes but he works so hard that he always makes up for himself, I'm looking forward to seeing how much he can improve throughout the years
omg united are back again will be all we hear now
Super Fred
Brilliant Fred. Top goal
Fred actually realized his full name isnt just fred after finding his passport and that he is brazilian, not welsh or Scottish
Fred showing hes a good player for once also alex telles had some great shots all looked like they were going in and this actually looked like a team for once, greenwood passing? and got an assist? unheard of haha
Dalot, Fred and Telles have been very good the last couple of games. Credit where it's due
The reaction of his teammates says it all
Shaw and wan bissaka should be very worried.❤️🤍🖤🇾🇪🇾🇪🇾🇪
That's more like it!! GGMU!!👊🏾👊🏾
fred the goat
Fred played amazing
Fred is a G...and always has been. Just not a 6 I think?
Well done Fred
Fred is a Legend
Ragnick is already a Legendary coach
United ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Now soon UTD will be in top 4
rangnicks at the wheel
Lol good job he meant it and wasn’t actually trying to cross it 😂
Red Fred Redemption
Fred to save man united 🙊🙊🙊
Some voodoo stuff is happening with Fred scoring a banger
Bloody Fred
What a cross Fred 😂
relife for fred i guess...
Fred had a brilliant game against Chelsea and came good again today, really playing well lately. Coming from someone who has never rated him
Baloon d or Fred
Not jumping hype train  Clean sheet is good and defending looking better hopefully rangnick can utilise all talents sitting there onwards
Fred channeling his inner Ronaldinho.
I’d still have Fabinho over Fred any day of the week
You just about beat Crystal Palace. united fans are hilarious in this comment section
fred realised he is brazilian
Way better passing and positioning smart tactics amazing game
Fred knowing he about to be history for Brazil
Please let's not get carried away with  Fred's performance ! How's he's ever still playing for Man United I do not know.
Look at Ronaldos reaction when Fred shoots😬
German Fuball Meister
Fred again
50p says Pogba has 3 good games again. £1 Says. The rest after are Souness worthy
Luke Shaw might be the best LB on the planet but no doubt he’s got good competition in Telles.
Keane humiliated
Pogba is lazy,, Rangnicks press will expose him. Time to leave me thinks
Red Fred redemption
So happy for Fred. He gets a lot of stick, but I've always liked him. Yes he hasn't always played great, but he has the ability to put in some great performances. Well done Fred, what a goal!! Some more of them please matey 👍
I’m truly happy for him tho cause he gets so much hate that I don’t think he necessarily deserves considering that he is such a nice guy and doesn’t stop smiling
Who is that player who scoreD. ….not seen him before ?? 🤭🤭☺️☺️☺️
Red Fred Fredemption
‘Fred on the scene’
Fred found his Brazillian passport
VIVA FRED!!!
McFred, you couldn't write it!
I think ragnick told them to take long shots 🤔🤔😂😂
The first half was the best first half of football I’ve seen from Man Utd since Sir Alex.
Fredinho.
My word we have an attacking RB!? Who new that the kid we signed and Ole hardly played was actually a good ATTACKING RB, like we we were trying to make AWB into...
Happy for fred
So happy for Fred 😂 👏
I just felt that the new man u coach is gonna make Man U great again. Just felt it really deep
Frednaldinho😎💪👏👏👏
Fred the Managers new favourite.
The ever evident frustration on the United players still concerns me
Bwahahahaha . Really ? Bwahahaha . 1;0 v palace ? ham shankers
fredington
Give this man the balon d'or Fred was robbed
Great going from seeing the utd fans hating Fred to loving him over a goal😂
Straight away you saw there was a proper structure to United, playing attractive football.
Why does Ronaldo never celebrate when his team mates score
Impressed untied are looking passionate again !
Dude gets so much stuck, sometimes justified, other times not so much, but I'm glad he scored a great goal like that😂
If you ask me he deserves to wear the shirt
Fred is shocking
1:12 can we just appreciate Ronaldo's leap and backwards header
The RRR: The Ralf Rangnick Revolution
Arsenal always give the worst United players careers. Lingard, Mctominay, now Fred.
United are so wasteful! They should of been 3 or 4 up at half time
Let the delusional “we’re back” chat start all over again after one win… another false dawn
And that’s just the beginning 😏
Fred’s Brazilian citizenship reinstated
i have high hopes for this new manager
Fredemption!! Fred deserve that goal he was sensational today!
So down for this redemption arc
Fred's at the wheel 😂
Dalot is so much better than awb going fwd and not a bad defender eithier he has to keep his place 😁
Man like Fred uno 😭😭😭😭
Fred is the most sideways player he give a goal one game the he scores one for United SMH
The rebirth of Fredante lol, the performance levels will start to rise again I think there will be a healthy fear factor back in the training room under Rangnick. End of season we gotta be looking at getting haidara and kalvin Philips to replace matic and mata.
Telles and Dalot more attack minded and even making the CDMs push up to CAM you love to see it 💥💥
Fred>
Goat 🐐
Fred is actually good for United he just makes a ton of mistakes
I wonder if Keano started liking Fred...
Look at Ronaldo when the goal goes in. Says it all really....
Let’s go Fred! Let’s go! Let’s go Boston Bruins!!!  Yeahhhhhh ☘️ 🇮🇪
Red Fred redemption
Interesting....... to see where this leads to
Tears of joy 😭😭😭. football with a philosophy and tactics.
Is it just me or did man u play 100% more fluent today than they have all year 🤔
Fred trying to impress rangnick to keep his 1st team place 😂
Bro if Ragnarok has fixed Fred, he deserves to be called a genius
I can’t believe it 😂
Have it all you Fred haters
Dalot and Telles 😍😍😍
When Fred scores you know Man Utd have had a lucky day.
Luke Shaw is finished.. Telles the new left back..
Rangnick Ball.
Why didn’t Ronaldo play?
Fair play to Fred 🔥 he’s been great in the last couple of games
Fred the Red
Remember them days when people were pushing to get rid of Dalot🤣
- could of done this when Ole was manager
Jesus H Christ!
Future Ronaldhinio
Just reading through the comments it's overwhelming how quickly man utd fans have once again become smug. It'll be quite a while before the Premier league title comes back to Old Trafford. Not anywhere close the City, Liverpool and Chelsea
Forget nathaniel clyne existed lmao
"And it's Fred" 😆 😂 🤣
Well done Fred gets so much abuse when he makes a mistake but I must say looks like a different player
*Keane has left the chat*
They should've shouted "Fred again" when he scored🤣🤣
How good is Telles?
Fred… this guy gives 100% week In week out, deserves so much more respect from fans.
I don’t knows anything about football but from my outside perspective I’d say that the team in the red uniforms must have had some kind of change recently causing them to play better maybe change of staff idk tho
DU DU DU DU DU S̶c̶o̶t̶t̶ ̶M̶c̶T̶o̶m̶i̶n̶a̶y̶ FRED
Man U is back!!!
Freds been our best player the last 5 games
Roy Keane must be biting his fingers.
Nice one united 👏 👍
Cant wait for the fred is the new yaya Toure  comments from united fans 🤣🤣🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
One game and United think there elite 😂😂 relax boys it's only crystal palace 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fred scoring the last goal of the ole Gunnar solskjær era and the first of the rangnick era you can’t make this up😂😂
Nice to see manchester smiling 😊
I’m pretty sure Ole had a winning start too 😂
This is why we are called the Red Devils. 👹👹
Everyone talking about how good man united is, yet they are only playing Crystal Palace…
Fred remembering he's brazilian
havent seen man u this attacking since ronaldo was previously at man u 😂   (its a joke)
Fredinho
For all his detractors Get that up ya!
Telles has some boot  on him
im not the only one who read the title wrong
Beating Crystal Palace 1-0 at home, this is our season lads!
*Fred was pushed forward into a more attacking role like what he plays for Brazil - and yes he does play for Brazil but unfairly targeted for the most when United play poorly. I think now he will really shine in his new role*
A team with a squad worth 1 billion beats a team that’s worth 9 times less by a flukey one nill win and he’s seen as a genius by the britsh media … bealsa got this treatment 2 years and and now the utd coach is this weeks internet darling
United will win the league now.
Lord Fred
1 goal doesn't justify his place in the United team he's never been good enough & never will be good enough. Maybe Rangnick can pick a decent starting 11 coz Fred certainly shouldn't be in it
Fingers to your ears Fred. Someone likes it when you do that.
WHAT A GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
FRED HATERS CARRY ON TALKING RUBBISH
FRESSI
The birth of Fredgar Davids 🤣🤣
Did penado play ?
Not been the best of fans of Fred as of recent but that was a tidy finish
Fred ended up finding his Brazilian passport
Fred is a good player, he just wasn't being put to his best use under Ole. He's Finally Brazilian again
Diego Dalot is so much better than awb
Proper attacking football well-done Ragnick. FRED has added I to his name. FRED IS FIRED UP NOW!!!;!!!!!
Fred most sleep on utd player, big baller
Just lucky win
Well Roy what are you saying to that headline ser 💚
FREDALDINIO!!!!
Had to read the title twice
We are talking about Dalot enough
Everybody: Ronaldo and messi are goat      Me: Lord Fred, lingardhino, goatwaite are da goats 😎🐐
Jesus give me strength, they beat a low division team and think they're great, I don't follow any team, very poor
Ronaldo looked disappointed 🤷🏽‍♂️
Thé commentateur commentated Portsmouth vs Sunderland
2Olegend ❤️
Look how angry Ronaldo is before he realises the ball hits the net😂
Fred is getting very good I see
Fred scored more goals than  Messi
Turns out Fred is Brazilian after all!
Fred gets too much hate, in real life he’s such a happy guy
The Fredolution
Roy Keane slowly removing the pins from his Fred voodoo doll.
🐐🤌
How Sky Sports can make this game so exciting in the highlights but in reality this game was awful. A real bore. Challenge was to stay awake.
Fredemption!
Fred  🐐
Fred again!
Seeing Fred as the thumbnail made me laugh ngl😂🤣
Fred's goal was a absolute. Beauty United look by far much better. Side under Rangnick, Attacking options that's want to see fro. United the Defence is a lot better i can United Improving under the. New manager, Telles nearly scored in the. First half United's most important thing. Is getting the three points. Onwards & Upwards, ⚽🙏
Every United fan will now say they never doubted Fred, he just needed time 😂
I must admit Fred's shooting has been improving lately, apart from his chip attempt against Chelsea. Several half decent shots on target from the edge of the box.
I swear Fred has improved massively since ole left
Fred scoring , jeez rangnick must be the best manager in the world
Soccermt u can watch for free no need for Sky
The commentator had that corny "leading man" comment in his pocket. A 1-0 win over Palace really doesn't merit that kind of adulation. But he had to get it in.
Freds time to shine
And that’s on factos👀👍
Fred Balon D’or 2022 winner 🤣🤣🤣
My guys name is Fred
Amazing  from Fred
Come on United... A good Win against the SPARROWS. I mean The Eagles. M. U. F. C.    Rule O. K.  Yeeha.  EBF never die We just simply multiply x
Dalot was great today, would like to see him start more often.
Most of all it was a clean sheet at home something we haven't seen enough of this year GGMU 🔴⚪⚫
Fred 🤩
Ill have a chicken dea gea, a bottle of fernandozade and a mcfred please
Happy for the lad! Mint goal
Fred Ballon'dor 2022 confirmed
And they said all Fred is a bad player.
Yassss fredo
not a united fan but great to see fred scoring a winning goal after all the slack he has received
Rangnick masterclass
This Fred guy seems good
Did United really dominate Palace cos they have no highlight
Man u taking long shots all game haha
Get the contract out, let him write whatever number he wants on there considering what he’s done since he come in. Ralf’s at the wheel man he’s doing his thing man united are BACK
Thought it said fred fires ragnick on debut
Always said Fred was good
Fred overall is such a bang average player how on earth he keeps his place at Manchester United of all clubs is beyond me but fair enough he scored today but he’s so average
FRED ARMY!!!
FRED I LOVE YOU🤣🤣🤣
Fred had always been overhated and underrated , he was just an easy blame , lad runs his heart out everygame
Ragnick tactics  Long shots
Mctominay has been constantly awful this season. I'm not sure why he isn't dropped for VDB.
Fred found his Brazilian passport
Fred literally getting better and better. Ever since the spurs game he's been one of our best players, he's made a couple of mistakes granted, but who hasn't. Litterally working his socks off in that midfield and now actually making the right decisions, keep it coming freddy boy !!
Fred found his passport
Yikes Fred showing he has Brazilian football magic in him.
2 assists & goal in week  not bad for scapegoat Fred
Man utd fans getting excited about beating Palace 😆
MAN LIKE FRED
Think iv watched the past 4/5 United games and Fred has been putting in such a graft every game and really performed. Definitely a key part to their team.
2 games where Fred is the man I am confused
AWB & Shaw gotta earn their spots back
Fred will shine under this manager.
Oh my fred 🤣😂👍👍
Fred and Ronaldo switching position…great tactic Rangnick
Giving Fred pure death last few months and he’s goes and does this
Alot of chances today 👍
Ayew🙀
Right said Fred...
A flukey goal and struggling to win against Crystal Palace at home and United fans lose their minds 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 this club are a laughing stock
Is it just me or is Fred getting better and better since olle left😱
Had be Fred really. I hope, this means something.
What a difference it makes having a right back that can pose a threat going forward
ralf's found fred's passport
Come on Fred you’ve been one of the worst players for a year or so let’s see how good you can finally be. GGMU
"Red Fred Redemption"
Look at all the delusional United fans in the comments as always 😭 scraped a win against Crystal Palace and think they’re a top club again fml, every single time they win their fans do this then they go on a 4 loss streak 😩😩😩😩😩😩 Ralf won’t save this team.
Good win for Manchester United!
United are still garbage.
Did Man Utd play well?
Mctominay has replaced Fred as the punching bag. He was horrific today
It wasn’t Ole that was the problem, it’s the players they have… still a finished club.
What's Ronaldo doing and why does he angrily clap or maybe try to handball it as Fred's shot is going in the net?
Great goal but let's keep the dancing for when it being produced week in week out
We have massively improved already under Rangnick
Yes my fredrin
Fred scores??!!? What next; Phil Jones gets an England call up ?!
Lol Ronaldo's furious when Fred shoots. When it goes in he has no idea what to do
fred? nah im dreaming
I loved how many chances we were creating today
Anyone who is surprised does not know football that well. Great coach will a great team Willa do great things
Fred already contender for Ballon D'or next year.
Telles is a savage
Lord Fred we salute you
Roy Keane still hates him!
fred again
FairPlay to him. Takes a lot of stick the lad. I hope his form continues.
Fred proving haters wrong 😂
Red Dead Fredemption
Go on fred lad
Dalot and Telles played really well. I hope they continue to play and able to show their talent, been on bench for far too long. Really want to see VDB getting some opportunity too. Utd for once looked really comfortable at back. 🙌🏽
Fred again
Fred really went to cross it to Ronaldo...
It’s not just FRED It’s FREDINHO Man of the match for me in uniteds last 4 matches. Been absolutely brilliant.
Scrappy 1-0's & dodgy pens...don't knock it, that's how they finished 2nd last season!
OFFSIDE RONALDO BLOCKED THE KEEPERS VEIW WHAT A DIRGRACE ITS ONLY BECAUSE ITS AT NEW TRAFFORD
Let’s not be fooled by Fred … remember when Martial had fans brainwashed thinking he was a striker
he's done enough to make rangnick  start him every game now
we're never gonna see Donny again after this... what did they put in Fred's dinner last night?
Only one that didn't celebrate was Ronaldo. His face is as miserable as martials lately
OAPRalf wins a classic 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Roy Keane...   Are you watching?
Miracles do happen , Fred scoring a banger
We’ll finish 5th this season
2 in a row United are back 😂
the first 20 odd minutes were delightful
Why does the lifestyle sport ad look like a porno
Actual goat
Cant wait to see Roy Keane slating Fred for dancing after he scored
Love how everyone praises Fred then one bad game they say he isn’t good enough for Manchester United Manchester fans are most toxic
Everyone loves Fred today till he makes his next mistakes 😂
No one thought it possible. Beating Palace 1 nil.
Give him a ten yearcontract
Celebrating wildly about one goal wins at home against lower league teams. About where they are.
Come on speccccccyyyyy
Fred is just trolling us.
rangnick really is magic if he can get fred doing something
Yesssssssssss FRED!!!
Fred is actually starting look like an asset to the club good goin👍
GGMU
Ronaldo ghosting
More league goals than Messi this year. Woooow
Rangnick only spent roughly a day with the players, before the match today. I can only imagine what he could do with 6 months - and this is supposed to be Klopp and Tuchel's tactical godfather...
I think Fred has the biggest smile in the world... Love seeing him when he's happy lol
Big fan of Ronaldo,but he need to learn to celebrate his team mates goals aswell like Rooney,then the team spirit will be high
Credit to Fred , the amount of flak he's had the last few months, just kept his head down, training hard now seeing the result s.
It could only be Fred 😂
Fred remembered he was brazillian
Fred’s starting to earn some respect at mufc
I THINK FRED MIGHT ACTUALLY BE BRAZILIAN
Fred scores the winner and Maguire helps keep a clean sheet?! What universe have I fallen into??
Great to see Dalot & Telles getting their chance,competition between players will bring results
Against Arsenal, Fred lost possession about ten times. He also got an assist and won us a penalty. He was simultaneously the best and worst player on the pitch. Today he missed some key challenges and made some hard-to-watch sliding tackles, but also placed in the winner from outside the box. Again, simultaneously good and bad. Fred, United's great oxymoron.
awww...look at united new manager bounce performance.....cute
Ole solskjaer started off well also
Fred scored 🤯
It looked like Watford vs Crystal Palace. Well done man utd
Finally the Somalian man scored
Past 3 games he’s been arguably our best player
*fred scores* “everyone liked that”
The streets may never forget!
This is obviously the Fred we seen when we signed him. Just not had the right influence, cmon fredinioho
🔥🔥🔥🔥
fred has always been under rated he does alot for the team.
Come on, it's only Crystal Palace don't get ahead of yourselves
RED FRED REDEMPTION!
An organised United is a terrifying thought. Team pressing, Fred scoring, just watch Rangnick turn Slabhead into a world class player😂
Starting to see the Fred we payed for. Brilliant
Fred aka Pele reborn
I've seen people happier at funerals than Ronaldo is when other players score.
Ronaldos header to Bruno won’t get spoken about enough
Ronaldo trying to catch Fred's goal!
I am waiting for Roy Keane's reaction
The real Fred is back.Ragnick will make the dead walk.
Fred 🔥
Was at the game scenes all round big up the reds🔴🔴🔴🔴
United are still a banter team.
I'm happy for Fred, but I feel we should find his replacement for January. I am impressed with Dalot he did his ting today hopefully that makes AWB realise his position is under threat and he needs to step us his game.
Fred silenced me today and I realised just how fit of a player he is. He is one of, if not our fittest player!  Ole openly mocked Fred, and put him into a system comparable to quick sand. Hopefully now Fred will continue to silence the nay sayers, that's including myself 👍🏽 GGMU🔴
As a united fan Fred did score a great goal but don’t get your hopes up he’s not the goat
We have all slagged off Fred, but this season he has improved a whole lot more. Let's see if he can carry on
Imagine they broadcasted QPR instead of this game.
Brazilian Kante
1-0 😂😂😂😂
What an improvment iv seen today from United specially  Dalot and Alex.
Fred again
Well done Crystal Palace for keeping this team down to 1-0 all the best for both teams this season
They could have got this guy to support Ole, instead they hung a club legend out to dry. Typical mancs
Fred has more league goals this season than the Ballon D' or winner lol
😂😱🙈🙊🙉     wot a....... ""GOAL "" fantastic win for Manchester United 6th in the league now they will be in the top 4 end of season 😱💖
Does anybody know why Ronaldo claps at 2:47 ? It's like he does it to put the keeper off or something.
fred finally found his brazilian passport
So called Biggest club in the world smashing Palace 🤣🤣
Fred playing more like Zico 😀
Fred again
Fred found his Brazilian passport
He desearves that goal. Gets alot of h8 from United fans but never shys away and always give his all for the team.
Utd seem to have their mojo back hopefully this management change is for the better now!
Lindelof was bagning today
Think this games proves Ole didn't have much of a clue
Wow A system in one game lol 😂
United fans will probably start calling Fred the best midfielder in the world soon tbh, like they do with all their players 😂
Of all people to score
All the plastic fans can pick up their tongues on the way out. Fred won us that game. Fred.
Fred be like: only joking lads time to smash it.
Wonder where the Fred statue will go?
No one would have thought fred would score in this gamr btw i was impressed how united played today we need to keep playing like this
As a Liverpool fan I’m glad Fred is becoming better
Rangnik has more energy than everybody...Good to see...now he'll pass that on...
The stupid side of things all this Rangnick stuff could have been done with Fergie ….twenty years of domination was wasted ….trophies for sure the Club lost credibility.
Small club Penchester
If only United had an upgrade on Mctominay and Matic concerning the DM Position. They could have a more balanced team
Fred is on his way to earning his brazillian citizenship.
Fred's the goat
Dalot and telles need to have a long run of games. The form of AWB has been poor of late and Dalot has look solid in his Absence as has Telles.
right said Fred.
United fans acting like they gonna win everything now 😂
nice
Pastor Fred is such a meme lmao
Go on fred
Fred suddenly realising he's Brazillian XD
fred what.
Beat palace at home 1-0 and “united are back” 🤣
Maybe Fred has been played in the wrong position for the past few years. Good to see Telles and Dalot getting game time. It's not all about new players it's about using the ones you have or at least giving them a fair chance.
A new manger all ready?
Flintstone rubble burst the bubble
Fred the red
United are back!! 😂😂😂
Be AFred, be very AFred
Honeymoon period
Mark my words, Rangnick is gonna turn Fred into a beast.
Bring it back!!
Pastor Fred. Respect him
Frednaldinho all of a sudden.
You could clearly see the way that Rangnick wants his team to play in that first half. We were very dominant. Playing a 4-2-2-2, high, organised pressing. Palace couldn’t get out and they barely created anything in the whole game. Second half we dropped off because of the players fitness levels but that will improve in time. Also I think Ralf is going to eventually replace one or two of these players because I don’t think they are all good enough to play his style of football.
Typical SKY shot count at half time was 2-2 not seen anything of Palace 🤣🤣 Sky Man U Sports Ltd
FINALLY FRED HS FINALLY PROVED HIMSELF AS MAN OF THE MATCH THIS GOAL WAS A REALLLLL  SHOCKERRRR
1 - 0 against palace and you lot in the comments are creaming yourself. Be back to factory settings soon.
More animated than ole already
Goals this season:  Fred: 2 Werner: 1
Dam I missed the game guys how was it was it a good game
Fred finally finds his Brazilian passport
If Ayew had thrown his willy at it, he would've scored that chance.
Fred is premier league paqueta
FINALLY SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUT!!! yessss
What timeline is this?
United fans getting excited after hammering world beaters palace 1 0   😂😂😂😂😂
Telles & Dalot, excellent, It seems the future doesn’t look good for Shaw & Wan Bissaka,
Fred after using his right foot and scores: Now I know how to get a shot on target
This is more like it. Other teams need to fear playing Utd again if we are to return to the glory days.
Fun fact: Fred has scored more goals than Kane and Messi combined.
Why the Man U fans keep saying Deno or something?
Palace are utter drivel.
Well done Fred, now never take a shot on goal again :D Got lucky!
It’s genuinely crazy the kind of input a good coach can make immediately. Look at Tuchel, Chelsea we’re heading for mid table, he comes in and within 2 weeks they’re nigh unstoppable and win the CL.  Lampard did lay the good groundwork for the team though so credit where it’s due.
Drop Dead! Who'd of thought it was Fred!?
It's Palace lol.  I'd EXPECT Utd to win this with their eyes closed, should've been 5 or more but nope.
Only good things for my team 🥺🥺🥺
Awsome Fred , still maguire out he was poor as always.
Fredinho at it aiming for the ballondor i see👀
Good win against a touch team
Lord Fred please continue to carry us!
Why did Ronaldo clap when the ball went over his head? Sneaky tactics to put off goal keeper no doubt lol
United had life to them today.
Big things too come from dalot💯
Why did Cristiano clap at Fred's ball on its way in? 🤣 2:46
Only just noticed how underrated telles is
Didn't expect Dalot to play this well icl
Fred again
I asked this question last time: What is Fred?
All these united fans love fred all of a sudden a few weeks ago yall were hating on him
😭😭 united beat palace 1-0 with a new manager and now think there back on form 😭😭 comical
Fred scored Rangnick is a genus
Everybody appreciate Fred from now
Was clearly a cross 😂 but I don’t care just wanted the win
Just gotta wait for the Fred again edits lol
Just wait till United lose then headline will say - WILL UNITED BE RELEGATED?!
Won’t be long till they get back to their mediocre best. New manager syndrome till jan, then the rot will set in again.
As a person who rates Fred alot, I wasnt suprised to see him score today and prove the doubters wrong!
Just showd what a change in manager does for you. Hopefully MU go back to their great form🤞🤞
It's funny how everyone used to rate him couple years back but now he's at united everyone slates him
United fans bully Fred too much he’s being carrying them for the last 4 games now
"Get the contract out. Put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him put whatever number he likes, for what he’s done since he’s come in. Let him sign the contract and go Rangnick's at the wheel man, he’s doing it, he’s doing his thing. Man Utd are back!"
Frediniho
Clean sheet at last good start and unlikely hero 🔥
Darlot is decent glad he's being fitted into the team regularly las few games we've bin better for it
Nothing wrong with that fella Fred. Leave'im alone 😝😝😝😝
Alex Telles 🔥🔥🔥
Come on you Freds
That's his job
People only have a go at Fred because he is called Fred.
Fred has 1 less goal than Lukaku this season… Let that sink in.
Fred deserves that one  The further forward he plays the better he becomes ...
From a liverpool fans prospective I’m glad to see someone like Fred do well recently
Utd best player
Better than penandes
FREDINHO!!!!
Wow its a christmas miracle
Man like Fred❤️
United fans who haven't watched Brazil play and think Fred has magically become a good player...  Bruh Ole just wasted him, let's see what he can do now, and what he could have done under Jose
Superb MAN U , long long time have not seen this team playing this  sharp . They could score 10 more goals .
Freds Brazilian instincts coming back
They beat crystal palace lol
It is time for Fredinho to develop his trademark celebration.
Tells on fire
Man U fans were slating fred 3 weeks ago the irony
A win with a *clean sheet!* Perfect. *COME ON UNITED!!! 🔴*
Thrashing the mighty Palace 1:0. Get a grip you lot.....ffs!
Greenwood could've won that young player of the year award under a better manager
why aren't these games on sky sports or BTsport??????😡😡
The title race isnt FRED yet
Dalot> AWB
3.12 of highlights is really milking it.
Couldn't watch the game today unfortunately but from the highlights telles and dalot looked like they were good for us today. Long may it continue
Keep it up fred
As lloris would say about fred... "when did he learn to shoot"
Man united
Let's go man u ited
Fair play for Fred with the hate he’s been getting that game was nothing to do with new manager Utd still looked horrendous
What was Ronaldo doing? Looked like he going to try punching it in 🤣
Im a united fan but im not even getting excited yet yh they pushed the attack but its only palace are they going to do that every week time will tell and will they do it against Liverpool city and chelsea or would it just be the defence tactics ill wait for the next 3 games
Is it just me that thinks if you pay these players these types of wages they should be able to play without a coach?
bury fred in the stretford end
Fred wins the balon dor 2022 😲
More fluid under Rangnick than they were with ole, the future is looking decent
What a goal from fred
Fred the Red
wow never seen untied play with this much intensity ralf what have you done with this team in just training session is incredible a new start for untied
Nice to Fred get turn in fortune
Well I guess donny is never gonna see the light of day now :(
Solid performance, really pleased to see a clean sheet, seems like a long time since the last one.
Fredinho
Watching these highlights makes you feel giddy again about United
Fred red redemption
Fredemption🇧🇷❤️
Reds fred redemption
This is the Brazilian Fred we needed
Fred is an enigma lol
People saying we will start playing like Liverpool or Man City, I disagree, we will start playing like the real Man Utd that won dozens of trophies
Look at these Man United fans already getting ahead of themselves. We'll see after a few games.
I have been crying for a performance with tactics thank you Ralf
Yo how
WHAT A GOAL BRUNO FREDANDES!
wondering what ronaldos reaction was about as fred takes the shot??
Fred for Ballon D'Or
That's much better, Fred, what a goal. Ragnick is the man I believe in him 👏🏿👏🏿
So that's what a Fred goal celebration looks like.
Give him respect now he is Brazilian and he is good
Looked much better with a tactician on the sidelines rather than a PE teacher/ guidance councillor
Fred finally realised he’s Brazilian
Palace robbed
We didnt concede, their is a god then theres Rangnick
Very satisfying to watch ua man United team with a clear style of play... Varane and pogba and cavani all to come back 🙏🏿💯⏲️
Yes Fred is redeeming him self. Up united
Don't forget Ragnicks only had a day of training and yet you can notice the massive impact he's has already, you can expect massive improvements in the coming weeks and months ahead..this is just the start.
Last few games he has played class, happy to see Fred succeed a goal today
I’m so glad telles and dalot are playing! They’re were better than btec English rubbish quality of Shaw and Awb!! Who can’t even cross a ball!
Fred slowly turning into prime Pirlo
Fred again
Everyone's talking about City, Liverpool or Chelsea winning the league but I bet United can win it under Rangnick 🔥📛
Rangnick is a magician.
notice how ronaldo is never happy when anyone else scores. he slips farther from the GOAT every day
Got to praise lord Fred with that fantastic goal still can't believe it. Also good team play show cased today. Give me likes today fam
Fred is beating the 'McFred' allegations
Why do we always ruin Fred's celebration. Last season, Bruno pushed him, this time Mason. 😭🐐
Why not on tv 📺 😡😡😡😡😡😡
coming from someone who doesn’t support united, they all ready seem a bigger&better squad. Its good to see
InFredible ❤️
Woe Rangnick is unbeaten! What a start. Defo would give him a 6 year contract based on this amazing start.
Well inn Fred happy for you.
Super Fred.👌
Shame on you Sky. 3 PL games on 2pm, none of them on your overcharging channels.
Big Fred back with a bang he's better then zidan now
Fred must've had some beef with ole lol
Fred has shut up all the haters now, love to see it
Let's go Fred 😀
It's 1 game. People need to chill 🤣
Comments here acting like they backed fred from the get go. The real ones know he had it in him just poor coaching. Happy for the lad
1-0 against Palace WOWWWWWW 😂
Fred again
Fred the unlikely hero today .....I’d ‘sell him’ in January, he’s a liability and not good enough to play in the premiership!
Fred scoring with his right foot from outside the box. Rangnick really is a genius.
It’s bloody Crystal Palace, watch how they fumble the next match
ja, ja, deutsche fuhrer uber alle managers
Fred scoring was probably a bigger miracle than Barcelona's comeback vs PSG
Who would have thought it Fred?
How Wan Bissaka always starts in front of Dalot is a mystery to me 🤌
Fred Again
With Dalot in the side we're always going to have more control; he's comfortable with both feet and technically more astute than Awb. I think Awb was the downfall for Ole- he spent £50m on a player who just doesn't suit a United team (he'd be a better fit for a team not expecting to win each week and who have to defend more). You can't then drop a player you paid £50m for and be like 'Oh yeah, the last manager bought a player for half the price who's better'...but paying £50m for a player of Awb's quality is a sackable offence in itself imo.
First clean sheet at home Manchester United won possession in the final third 12 times vs. Crystal Palace. That’s the most they’ve done so in a Premier League match since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. Crystal Palace [H] was Man Utd’s strongest first half of the season for: passed ending in the final third [108] -passes into the final third [48] -touches in the opposition’s box [26] -passes into the opposition’s box [26] -possession won in the final third [6] Dalot, Telles and Fred were exceptional today. Won't be surprised if McTominay gets dropped, poor yet again.
Why did ayew drag it wide
Everyone always makes comments about Fred like "unlikely hero" etc.  However o think he's been one of their best performers for last 3 or 4 weeks and he was in great form for Brazil this year
United players always play good when they get a new manager...lets hope they keep this tempo 2months from today
I don't understand what was Mctominay  doing for 90 minutes? Why Maguire playing long ball? These 2 British players are useless.
League goals: Fred - 2 Messi - 1  No more needs to be said than that.
Fred again!!
Ragnick has removed the shackles from Fred 🔥
Yes Fred aleast one
Who would've  thought the first goal under Ragnick would be introduced by Fred
Fred is world class.
Lots of people think Fred is bad but he is so underrated. He may not be good at playmaking but he’s still quite good.
When he scored that crowd was the loudest ever. MUFC
Utd defence need work big time... sort that defence out with better player I'm sure utd can challenge for the league. Otherwise no chance for titles.
Ragnick: if Roy Keane was in here I would grab him the by the shoulders and say “why don’t you like Fred?”
Fred is so overhated, he's better than McTominay and links up with Bruno much better than Pogba does. United should play Bruno, Fred and Van de Beek in midfield, then sell Pogba for lots of money and use it on another centreback to play with Varane
Wished Donny could have played but new era ahead of us great win siuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Thats more like it 😬
Fred took that lob meme personally.
Rangnick showed more passion on the touchline in one game, than ole did in 3 years
1 training session under Ralf and that first 30 mins is what he is all about.
Fred is such a likeable character
“Fred Again”
We're gonna win the league!......next year
Dalot should start every game. AWB not good enough
Fred always pulls out a yearly screamer lol
Are you Ronaldinho in disguise? 👀
We might be a serious club now tears 😭
Maybe now people can see why Ole kept playing Fred? Just maybe never had the managerial experience to recognise the nuances needed to get the best out of him
OMG FREDINHOOO
WRECK IT RALF!!!!!
yeA
Walahi Fred has been my fav player since 2019 hes finally getting some recognition
A Uefa conference league place looks like a real possibilty for Utd with results like this!
Its only crystal palace ngl
Happy to finally have a clean sheet at Old Trafford!
As much as I've enjoyed United circling the drain over the past few seasons, I miss the days when I would get nervous when we played United instead of making them look amateurish. Hopefully there are better days ahead.
United are using him wrong. Fred is the type of player u need to play in a CAM position.. he is someone who can take long range shots from that position
Idc i still hate fred
Are man u back?!  COME ON! 🔴
Waiting for pat prank pe peacher to drop the comment
No Fred again today?
FRED HATERS IN THE MUD. What you man saying now? 🤫🤫😏
Adblocked
Fred 🔴⚫️🔴 70% successful forward pass rate.  83% passing accuracy  77% tackle success rate  1 belter if a goal 🔥
Donny  over mctominay and I'll be happen amazing pressing and defence deigo telles Fred looking good
Ragnick got Fred scoring winner😳, truly might be the start of a new era 😂
1:14 Rangnick made ronaldo pass that jesus
Come on Utd ❤️🔴🔴
I love how gassed all the utd fans are with this guy just like how they was when ole came in. 🤦‍♂️
My GOAT 🐐🤩🤩🤩🤩
Uniteds best performance of the season. Deserved more goals.
We already look a better coached team after just one session with the new manager. Ole really was useless!
If dalot scored that goal after weavily in and out of 2 defenders that would have been an amazing goal
Fred is an absolute fraud in every book smh 🤦‍♂️
Hopefully the glazers reward Fred with a new lifetime £300k p/w contract
Fredgar Davids
Fred the goat
Fred dead redemption
Fred = 🐐   😂
Yes fred!
He really is Brazilian...
Fred has been good in his last 3 games
Absolutely incredible from the boys 👏🏼👏🏼
Fred dead redemption
Fred > Origi
These highlights weren’t as good as the live commentary suggests they should’ve been
Fred played really will last 3 games
lord fred has done it
When messi doesn't score he gets so much slander, when ronaldo doesn't score not a single soul mentions it, media biasy it its finest
FREDALDINHO
Jorginho 3rd ranked ballondor player yet is playing worse than Fred ATM
You would think 6 months as a manager is not enough to make an impact, look how he’s transformed United in just one day 😳
Pastor Fred had to deliver his Sunday Sermon today. 🇧🇷
FRED❤️
Not surprised his passport got stamped two weeks ago
Well that's 500 shots and 1 goal for Fred, maybe it will be 400/1 next time, that will show improvement
Fred scored this cannot be true 🤣
The scruffiest jammiest club in the world strikes again. Palace hang your heads in shame how do you get beat by these bums 🤣🤦🏼‍♂️.
3:05 Don’t let Roy see this
🔥
Fred’s played very well last few games to be fair to him
You can see how tactically structured Ralf has made Man Utd, the amount of chances Man Utd got this game is unbelievable to say the least clearly Ralf has had a positive influence
Silence them Fred
Incoming reactionary comments from people who think they understand the sport from a tactical standpoint.
dalot and telles over shaw and wan bissaka every day of the week
That guy Fred!!!
fredinhooooooooooooooooooooooooo😂
He is Brazilian after all
Honestly, Fred is a class player, his pressing is nuts and so is his commitment to the badge. We need to iron out his errors, after that he could seriously be one of the best cdm's in the world.
FREDEMPTION 🔥
Fred has more league goals than Pessi.
Fred has turned into prime vieira recently
Credit where credit’s due, Fred has been amazing these past few games.
The evolution of Fred!
banging win with ralf whos  cracking manager lets go united siuuu
Ever since he got hit in the face by Casemiro things have changed
Amazing disrepect to Ollie now that Man u players all of a sudden start playing! You should all be sacked for you lack of desire!
For all the stick he's had, Fred has done well since Ole left.
I honestly don't know what to think about Fred anymore.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Fred
never felt alive watching Man U game like today
Fred was never the problem with McFred side as these idiotic pundits were saying. Think why is it Mctominay has to start in centre back for SCOTLAND but Fred benches Fabinho and starts for BRAZIL. In 2016 i had Fred in career mode cus he was a baller 5 years later PROVEN RIGHT under the correct manager he will excel...
Fredved
Telles and Dalot have to maintain their place in the starting 11 Dalot offers so much more than AWB and has improved his defending
2 shots on target, not exactly setting the world on fire.....
Fredinho
What a banger
We're finnaly managing to control  games again and Fred's playing class
The redemption arc has begun
We can add that fred goal to the huge list of incredible goals scored against Palace..
I know it's early days but shoutout to Adam McKola's prediction that Fred is gonna be the man under Ragnick.
It’s mad how Fred is still stealing a living… turns up every other year with a goal. 99% of games he is garbage.
Fred is so goood
Lol Fred
Roy keane sitting mumbling like joe pesci in home alone
Fred again🎶🎹
This was such a statement performance...  The league might be beyond us (maybe we'll sneak second again) but I'm super confident the fa cup and champions league are in the bag... The whole of europe will be quaking on our boots after this performance!!
Varane, Cavani & Pogba still yet to come ✅
Nobody:  FlashScore: Rangick regime Fred-dy for lift-off
Fred the 🇧🇷🐐 had more league goals than messi n he plays in the pl
Rangnick SZN is underway
Why didn't ronny and Bruno celebrate freds goal? Can somebody tell me.
We actually put on a performance, you can tell there’s still so much to work on but we was dominant.
After one training session already streets ahead of ole
Finally United have keep clean sheet
Crazy how much different United already look. Promising times finally.
Hurry up with the Spurs game
Fred again🤝
As a Liverpool fan I’m happy for Fred
Fantastic finish by Fred!!! Just needs to fix up his ball control and will be a top CDM
If the the tactics can change this much after 1 training session what will happen after 10 training sessions
Fred has finally found his Brazilian passport 🙌🔥
Fred’s going to thrive under Rangnick 🔥
Roy Keane “why are you playing Fred”
Fred the red
Fred. Fred has just scored that. What is happening?
COME ON THE RED DEVILS
All of Fred's haters, please gather here😅
I told you all Fred is the best player in the world, you all laughed at me 🤬
Anyone think that Rangnick could become a permanent choice if he performs?
Dalot been looking good in the last couple of games.
Man United have changed❤️‍🩹
Ralfy
This is probably our hardest game with run of fixtures we've got atm hopefully we score more goals and improve ggmu
Best Brazilian in the League rn
am i still twisted from last night or did fred just stick one in the top bin
Freddy
It could only have been been Fred...
2:46 Ronaldo already knew it was going in
Lets go
You can definitely see glimpse of what's to come with our style of play it's definitely going to take some time to perfect but it's 100% exciting times ahead for us
Fred: I've actually been right-footed this whole time
FREDemption
Pastor Fred
What a finish to earn the three points, not sure he could've struck it much better
You are doomed to lose when Fred scored against you. It's like a goal and a half. Massive psychological blow.
Fred was their best player the season before last I have no idea how United fans flip flop so much. He’s the only good presser in the squad he’s unreal
Probably new manager bounce and he’s only had 2 sessions with them so technically it won’t be there yet but it was better all over
People expecting VDB getting game time with Ragnick (ik it's just the first game) and he scores in Ole's last game   People expecting Fred not to play under Ragnick and he scores under his first game as interim lool
keep this up lads, i love the tikki takka passing keep it up
Fred and Ralph....could be the start of something beautiful!
🤨😲
First time where I didnt feel uneasy with the defence today. Felt like were were in control. GGMU
Fredtastic
Goals in league: Fred-2 Ballon d’or winner aka PESSI-1 There’s levels to this game
Last few games fred has been outstanding,fully deserved that goal today❤❤❤
Fred the goat
I can see potential in this manager the style of football is intriguing and Man Utd look like a different team playing under him
so happy for Fred
Fred actually became Brazilan today
Lord Fred from now on
Fred has actually been Brazilian for a few weeks now👏
What a shot .
…And on the 8th day God made: Pastor Fred.
Up the RH
Ralphs at the wheel
What a goal from Fred
Fred
didnt watch the game but i'm sure we were decidedly average and got a goal in the last 10 minutes cause why not
He was so excited that he fell over
Fred actually got robbed of ballon dor he’s showing Ronaldo that he’s the best in the world
Fred > fabinho
Fred will be captain and end up with a statue soon...
Celebrating beating crystal palace 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Where did y’all watch the match? It wasn’t on bt sport or sky sport
I swear people forget when we first brought Fred where he actually played, his an attacking mid not defensive thats why he has been playing a bit better but this has always been Fred gives everything for the team!!
One game at a time. Kudos to everyone 👍
The difference in football already.....
No one cares
Fred wrote the bible because he wanted everyone to worship someone else for a change
Dalot fred and telles🔥🔥
still cant believe rangick, a united coach, signed players like Konate, Firmino, Mane, Keita, Werner and even smith rowe
Not looking good, 3 losses on the bounce
Everyone will be talking about Fred, but not the performance from united
Fred has been in unreal form recently
Turns out Fred does have a right foot
Fred Masterclass
I just realised that Fred has more goals than Messi in the league this season 😂😂😂😂😂
Wicked deflection …
Good goal Fred well done 🔥🔥🤝
Lord Fred back at it again
what a goal from fred
You couldn't even script this😭. Fred Again!!!!!
Fred :2 league goals
People acting like my Nan Couldn’t win against Crystal Palace by 1 goal
Fred found his passport.
Man Utd have never lost a game in which Fred has scored in
As a Liverpool fan go on Fred, get me a cheeky 84 totw on FIFA I beg
fred 2022 ballon d'or winner
Red Fred redemption baby
Decent goal fred
His actually been playing good recently to be fair to him congrats fred.
The most organised United have played in a long time. Loved every bit of it!
People criticise Fred but sometimes he is the reason Man Utd get back into games yes he can make mistakes that can cost them but he can also bring Man Utd back into games.
Jesus Loves You!
Balon d’Fred 🔥🔥
Fred got too much hate
Donny needs to play along side Fred he was so good when he came on
This is a FREDemption season
That’s why ole kept picking Fred
No better goalscorer than Fred to mark a new era at United. GGMU!
Ralf has the same players Ole did and had them playing like Pep’s City relentless pressing all over the pitch. Can’t wait to see more from this impressive genius of a manager
After doing a ancestory check it turns out Fred IS actually Brazilian. Great goal. Great performance.
Fredinho silencing the haters
They’re going to win the league! 😂
Everyone's talking about Fred, but no one is going to talk how well Telles has been so far
Of all the players...it was always going to be lord fred
Banter united
Fred MoM and clean sheet - two things that never happened under Ole
Ragnick found fred’s brazilian passport
Fred is actual class ngl
So how come Shaw was playin over telles??
Poetic justice for pastor Fred ❤️❤️
Telles and Dalot really performing well recently, with Rangnick on the wheel its going to be very elite
Gotta love Fred the goat
who would’ve thought that ragnicks first win would come from a fred goal
we will beat city and liverpool to the title this season imo. dont see anyone stopping us
Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. Rangnick's at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. Man United are back!!!
Fred not doing too bad
Ain't no way Fred has scored more league goals than Messi and Kane this season 🤣
Fred the 🐐  More league goals than Messi this season 🤣🤣🤣
Everyone been banging on about this guy I've never heard of like he's god and he can only just beat Palace.
I knew he wasn't that bad
Unexpected goal well done Fred!
Fred was always my no.1. never doubted him for a second. No seriously tho. I think Fred get alot of warranted criticism but also alot of unnecessary hate. Viva fred
Fred has more goals this season than the ballon d’or winner
Lord Fred scored
Fred again…
Great play fred
And that was after just one day of training with ralf
Roy Keane "WHY IS OLE PICKING FRED?"  Fred: Hold my beer
Fred I’m sorry
the size of this dub is absolutely gigantic.
Man it's redemption 🔥
I don't think anyone would have predicted Fred to score the first goal under Rangnick.
Well Done FRED and TEAM 🙏🙌👍👏🤩
Man United looking fire under Rangnick🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fred mustv’e read that note pretty well
Rangnick's at the wheel tell me how good does it feel
Rangnicks at the wheel
Waiting until all you bash on Fred when he has am off game 😃
Fred   thats it Thats the comment
Fred has been reminding me of a unknown midfielder known as zidane lately😮‍💨
Fred
Fred the goat😭
Fred again🐸
They actually looked so much more composed, rangnick set out to fix their defensive problems and we saw that today, I believe Man U can still finish top 4 👏
So Ole didn't coach Fred well..Seen FRED grown this past few games.Hope it continues!
Fred is the boss
We looked really solid today , coulda been around 5 but well done Fred 👏🏿
FRED 🇧🇷 GGMU 💥
Fred deserves the next ballon dor
92nd!
My brain still cant process the fact that fred scored
FREDINHO
The score doesn't really show how much United dominated the game. Need to put away these chances next time. Let's go United.
Fredinho
What a breath of fresh air seeing United playing tactical football once again. What a game from Telles, Dalot, Fred and Lindelof. Exciting times ahead for my fellow united fans
Tbf Freds a good player he just makes a few mistakes
"once Fred scores, anyone can score."
Fred redemption I’m so excited to see what Ralf does with this team 😄
Fred be like: “You all laughed at me. Well I have to say, ur not laughing now.”
FREDHINIO
Fred has more league goals than Lionel Messi this season.
Fred again
as you can see, for a brief fleeting moment Fred remembered he was Brazilian and got a good shot away
First clean sheet at home since march. I must be dreaming😂
Fred>Messi
74th
How has Ayew missed that
Siuuu
Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. RANGNICK'S (Ole 3.0) at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. MAN UNITED ARE BACK!!!
Man Fred been a different player since ole left
Fred=🐐
Was about as good as we could ask for. I'm surprised at just how much influence Rangnick has already had on how we play. Still a lot to learn & it'll take time but if we are picking up the points whilst progressing with the manager's ideas then you can't ask for much more.
The football we played was so good.
Great to see ferguson smiling
Fred been good recently
Pastor Fred is cooking. Ralfs at the wheel.
Ain’t no way Fred has scored the first goal
Gets played in the right position and he has these wonder games, my midfielder 🇧🇷 🐐
REVOLUTIONARY FRED!
The press was outstanding and he’s only been there one day. 🥶
