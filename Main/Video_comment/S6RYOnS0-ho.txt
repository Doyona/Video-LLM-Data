1:26  yep i remember why i hate this
m
c6 lvl one. That makes me cry.
I have heard that this was a traumatic experience for paikon.. let’s see if the legends were true  Verdict: the legends were true after all
this makes me glad I lost my nahida 50/50 witch later led me to garenteed chasca
“it’s still level one.”  bro called nahida an it😭
is this albania flag??
.
?
..
Alternate title - 4 ped@philes
“where’s a really flat place” “my @ss”
That "ahhh😩😫" on the cryo flower tho
The traveler's name?? 😭
That would be Hell for me
this video was something else
Why did you say "it's still level one" 0:11
FURRIES ONLY
AND I HAVE A NOT A 5 or a6 Star I have a 7 star and it the unknown God heheh heheh
AND LEVEL 90 BUT MY MANE IS GANYE
MY NAHADA IS C6 AND IT DOES 100 CRIT RATE
Alternate title: bullying 3 other Nahida's so they don't use their bursts and skills.😂
I see now why you always say 4 nahidas is the worst 💀
This is why she’s not meant to be dps… she’s a sub or sup. Alone she’s only good if it rains.
DreamNotFound? Have I found a Shipper?
Good lore: if you hit nahida with an electro attack she gets all her power back because she’s a plant 😂
I like how it looks like all nahida jump dancing around looks so cute 😊
20 minuit of genshin lolis moening
I want nahida so bad 😭 I desperately need a 5 star and I love how she plays!
Most chaotic clip of the week..
The moment you get Nahida, the Oceanid disappears with her skill
Nahida *
Nah Ida is so CUTE ❤
w
The only archon daring to look like radish
did anyone else notice that nahidas attacks are computer based. her light attack has her jumping on keyboard keys. and her heavy normal attack and her light elemental burst has her using a cursor to highlight her enemies
My favourite character:)
I was watching this stream so no you lost all 50/50
"this may hurt a little" _Nahida asplodes_
"its so slow" legits build EM for a mono element team
Try 4 noobhidas, I mean nahidas again with the new bosses. See if it will take 3 days to finish
1:04 “omg so little” *stares at 3120 red paper*
Shes is making a letter to your therapist but she keep cntrl + alt + delete because she keeps making mistake
i have an idea for a team comp:     hu tao, zhongli, nahida, kokomi   (if i had a 5 star)
my curent team is Scara, Yae , Bennt and Nahida and I'm pretty sure I've done over 95k with this team...
Bloom has the best reactions but dendro alone is pure ass cheeks.
12:50  17:20 😂
this is without wenut☠️☠️☠️💔
I want this be “I made world a cabbage with 4 nahida”
“oh my god, I have so little of these”       … I.. have none… at all…
is anyone gonna talk about how his traveler is named dreamnotfound? no? oh ok..
can you do klee?
ur build is bad
Abbobie: shh I have one star weapon 5:53
5:52 why was he not holding sprint?
I think all of Nahidas regular attacks is her playing hop scotch.
That guy could have been in the middle of a war and he would leave to go get his Ramen because there's no way
I thought the first person you joined in the video was me until i saw the ar and signature 💀 (im a nahida main so i use her in my pfp and i have the same name card)
NAHIDA IS SO PURE, WHOLESOME AND CUTEEEEE
It's true, I got Nahida at a SINGLE PULL on her rerun My ritual actually worked! :D
This playthrough still haunts him to this day.
Where Are you streamimg
Not you skipping the cube of dirt just use eye of blah blah blah and Eula’s artifacts
I JUST GOT NAHIDA TODAY SO I AM BACK TO WATCH THIS VIDEO!
His screams were hilarious 💀💀💀
Nahida is a best waifu in Genshin impact 😮
"Not to mention this mf lost all his 50/50's kekw"
Nah I didn't know that the dendro chicken was dendro resistant 💀 I have been fighting against it with tighnari sincerely forever and I survived
Can nahida kill the bird?
This video kinda makes me sadge, nahida is so good!! Not by herself obviously, you’d barely get a 10k with her by herself. How to use nahida!! (For a super good team, use Nahida, Beidou/shogun, kuki, and sucrose/kazuha) use nahida burst then skill swipe every enemy. Activate ur electro output. shogun/beidou skill and burst, kuki skill and burst, sucrose/kazuha skill and burst. Then the magic happens, switch back to nahida and skill swipe again, now just start attacking. Ez quicken dmg
Itspaikon: oh my god I have so little of these  Me who has 4: OMG SO MUCH
I got nahida on 1 pull :O
Can I have a nahida? I need a nahida C0
Maybe u need to level her up to 90 bc nearly all the bosses were level 90+
"Don't suck me''                     -itspaikon 2022 6:14
Paikon:NO DON’T LET ME DIE. It’s not going to be me surely *dies*
BRO I JUST LIKE THE WAY YOUR SAYING DPS DPS
Do a new 4 nahida It will be funny with the Wentz and the new boss
840 resin hurts my heart
I love how her gameplay reflects her lore she's very weak and I bet that a strong vision holder like varka can probably beat her the only impressive thing she has as an archon is her abilities and those are more supportive which is just like her gameplay but if someone is taking advantage of her abilities however they can be very strong and can go through even the toughest challenges with how good her abilities are just like her gameplay which is how her teammates take advantage of her 'all schemes to know' to constantly make dendro reactions while also getting more elemental mastery from her burst.
Suggestion: I froze the world with 4 Ayaka.                I don’t mind if c6 or not
Why do you always think that you do the most damage. And you are talking too much.
i got a nahida genshin ad for this video- love that targeted advertising
Its insane that paikon has most c6 5 stars while being f2p its insane his luck is real good
Me seeing the traveler named DreanNotFound be like:  that's sus👀📸
Really should have used Lost Prayer over Verity. I believe the one there was R3, meaning 48% DMG to all dendro damage, versus the R1 Verity's 48% for the E, and only 12% for the regular and charged attacks.  And since there's no character swapping, its big downside doesn't exist either.
1:05 omg I have so little BRO I HAVE NONE!!!!!
I asked my friend which genshin character it’s your waifu and he said nahida
So nahida came UT 4MONTHS AGO?(please correct me) feels like a year
WHY IS UR TRAVELER CALLED DREAMNOTFOUDNJFDFRGOJ
7:36
Make a video of 4 ventis
4:28- tHiS mIgHt HuRt A LiTtLe
He has 109 dream solvents i have 1.....
True! You lost all 50/50 for Nahida!
Lol I am a noob
please dont use Gods name in vain
Yes
abbobie in the caht: sHhh iHAve A 1 StaR WeaPoN On
I watched 3 of his videos and I laughed every time he says JOHNG LEEEH
Childrens vs Bosses
"DON''T SUCK ME!" 💀💀💀
Elyis is a youtuber you must subscribe now!
you didn't do electro cube
He got 6 of what-
When Rukhdevata break too many branch of irmansul:
I CANT EVEN LVL MY LVL 23 XIAO CUZ I HAVE ZERO OF DOZZZ TINGSYSSS
That was 20 minutes of child abuse
2:15  bro was gonna say tighnari
Everytime I see a whale. I am at my wits to quit genshin
wtf how did you get c6 nahida
How is nahida crit worse then my qiqi
So is abbobie a robot or like just ur best friend
The waffle house has found it’s new host
3:52 KKKKKK O Kazuha com nome Piter "Obrigado Lula" kkkkk esses br
6:21 ive never seen that attack before
U could at least be a bit nicer to everyone
Nahida got that domain expansion
the nahida gremlin army noises are just 💀
you: " i have so little of these" Me:"I dont even have five"
6:43 it took me 15 minutes to kill the anemo hypothesis tbh
15:30 They should have put a wet floor sign there so that wouldn’t have happened
paikon eat my shorts >:D
The first part: *Hyah ta! Hahm- haa-Hya wa-*
How the hell was 4 Nahidas slower than 4 Doris????
Ahem      I pulled a qiqi I’m not feeling very goodddddd I pulled a qiqi lost 50/50 not even kequing and now I am out of primojemsssss
It’s crazy how good musty is but all of his goals are so simple while dark is hitting the craziest shots like it’s nothing
Is it just more or after the ruin dragon boss my quality just went down to 0-
@itspaikon when are u online? on twitch?
^w^
the constant mispronunciation of genshin characters are so severe at this point i think hes literally forcing himself to change his dictionary
YOU FORGOT ABOUT AZHDAHA BOSS
my nahida do 14k dmg
i never thought id hear paikon say "give me the birds" on oceanid
Itspaikon: "I have 6 of these so let me just activate theses"  Me : buddy i think u haven't touch some grass in a while-
The damage and destruction would be insane if you added 1 Ei to that team😭
Oh my lord. That was hella painful to watch.
USEEEEE DPS
have you done four Sucroses' or four Dionas'?
You keep creating planets why not create a dick with amber
Tip for the dendro cube : Using pyro can deplete its hp continuously until its effects run out
day 7 of asking paikon to do 4 choldes
I can’t stop laughing when the message pop up and said”this mf just lost all his 50/50”😂😂😂😂😂
you said for some reason... what a sarcastic
i just got nahida when watching this vid this is proof that he gives free luck
Best character
I never watched this guy but the way he pronounced "John Lee" 😆
wth did I see your resin is 840? That's hurt me somehow
"STOP TIMEAS" that got me falling off my bed laughing
Still can't believe he's called John lee now     John lee Joestar
"dont suck me" -itspaikon 2022
My 50 nahida does that
7:14 - 7:16 period.
The fact that nahida stole EI’s gnosis
"RUN RUN DONT SUCK ME" **Dirty mind mode on**  Btw here is the time stamp - 6:14
paimon is the only f2p person who can C6 every character on genshin😂😂
i question how much resin this is
hi paikon! I wanted to see you try my team (: the team has Nahida Kokomi fischl and yanfei I have a tip with it too in steps: 1. take a pic with nahida 2. kokomi e 3. fischl e 4. yanfei e and attacks
i wish i could have her
if you want a dps you need 4piece gilded dreams
I found you after 1 year !!😭
What he ment by "Can u imagine not doing this with using c6 Nahida" he ment imagine not doing this by using money
after seeing the fight of the anemo cube, it clearly shows that nahidas biggest weakness is mono dendro comps she basically revolve around reaction
Y'all see what reactions does to a nahida main... IMAGINE THE POOR DMG I DID BEFORE NAHIDA WHAT THE HELL
Bruh dream not found
I just rolled nahida c6 and it doesn't seem worth it
I have Nahida but idk how to build her. I am not f2p player :(
The title for the 4 Laylas one: I slept with 4 Laylas.
I have nahida
I never let your Nahida team to farm my world)
4-player Dance Dance Revolution
What weapon was paikon using?
can totally tell when someone suffers from success or zhongli poisoning when they die so much when using a character that can't kill instantly and they're forced to dodge...
This is one of the rare moments Paikon says "Gimme more birds they are easy" 😭
yoimiya solos
Plants vs Zombies in a nutshell
Day one of asking him to join my co op : Kusanali
I guess we can say abobbie found a Hobbie besides genshin
"for some reason" huh...
Nahida is pretty good because dendro reactions are actually broken
bvkch0i : *Not to mention this mf LOST ALL HIS 50/50.*
Just lost my 50/50 to Keqing. Now I’m living vicariously through this.
BRO THAT *JJ* PERSON IS MY FRIEND OMG
Can l join
5:57 and 7:58 : xiao during that one archon quest
Hey @itspaikon, I just had this idea you might like to do. You can maybe do all four archons speed run? since Nahida's out and you have her. I thought it could be a good video idea. Great video!!!
Can you do Venti?
4 archons when????
I am gonna cry because everyone got nahida but me lost on 50/50 with diluc in 87 pity
i dont like your profile pic.
I watched the whole video but didn't see the planet he was talking about in thumbnail, waste of time
f2p
I’m like so impatient for the wanderer one
why do you kinda sound like badboyhalo? no hate hehe
the disappointment i had when he said 1010 and there’s not a wave of spams of XL among chat.
that's where my nahida went
i want nahida but i also dont want nahida
so what we can conclude from this is: dendro is extremely reliant on reactions
Does my eyes decieve me.. or did i actually see his resin was 840/160
Paikon best f2p
Looking forward to seeing this guy suffer for 5 hours or more when snezhnaya drops 😂
5:50 And it actually was LOL (2:39:37).

Zayin more like Radishin’
(I'm not jealous I'm not jealous.....) *Im jealous*
Your fcking traveler is named DreamNotFound???😂😂😂😂 I would of never expected that😂😂
The only reason I pulled for her was for the meme…Now I have a all archon team.
🤣 abbobbie is so funny
Im looking for video with 4 Nahidas doing ASMR.
5:25 that’s what she said..
Noobhida
NEXT: FOUR ARCHONS FIGHT ALL THE BOSS! INCLUDING THE WEEKLY BOSS PLS🧎🧎
5.06 bwhaha
Flamingo
:(
Just wholesome Lettuces.
NOW DO 4 ARCHON
the weapon is a god damn lamp... A FUCKING JINNI LAMP!??!?!?!
U think Nahidas burst is long? Then u should *definetily* play some Honkai Impact 3rd and use Hersherrcher of Thunder *:)*
can you imagine this realistically? i mean, imagine walking up a hill and seeing 4 little children beating the crap out of a dragon.... with finger cameras. 🤣
18:25 at this moment, *paikon became the chicken* (not like chicken as in scared, but like he made a chicken noise)
So little of them you say… I STRUGGLE TO GET 1!!!!
You just built Nahida wrong. All characters need to stack HP and DEF. :)
Alternative title: I started the biggest hopscotch campion ship of all time with 4 nahidas
What’s a good f2p build for nahida, I just got her and I need help building her 🎉
Can you do a i ruled the world with all archons
she wasn't lying when she said she isn't good at combat
C no
John li
Lol EM goblet is useful for nahida 🤣 paikon u sussy baka
I wanna b in one of your videos so bad but I can’t get the characters fast enough 😭
Everyone after meeting 4 Nahida's: OMG IS THIS WHAT FUCKING GRASS LOOKS LIKE 999 TRILLION YEARS AGO?!
4 archons when
pls do 4 ganyus im sobbing
Lmao you killing the anemo cube is what it looks like for me with elemental reactions 😭😭
Nahida alone : I do nothing Nahida with electro : I'm the dps now Nahida with blooms : Hehe die comrads
Do 4 archon it will be fun please 🥺
meanwhile my nahida doing 25 damage be like: 👁👄👁
At first I didn't want to watch this video because I was too sad that I lost my 50/50 to Mona, but here I am 🥲
4:06 multiple nahida ults can exist
Nahida is best in an elemental reaction team.  Elements: dendro (Nahida) hydro, electro, and pyro.  Best elemental reaction team.
Him:oceanid is hard Me who fought oceanid 45 times    I almost choked while making this
How it is easy pese and you always die your team had to finish it🤔🤨
Are you asia
7:40 woahhh nice transition it was so silky smooth and btw who else is waiting for "I saved the universe with all the archons" or something like that
11:20 the sound of defeat
Okay how can my man do so much damage in one minute, WHILE A LITERAL S P E C TAKES ME 5 HOURS.
Finally I actually watched atony Chenn since he didn't post vids and when he posted this I was like FINALLY I THOUGHT U WE'RE NEVER GOING TO POST A VIDEO ABOUT NAHIDAAAAA!!!!
OK hear me out-
E
6:13 💀
I wanted to join that one but I missed the stream wished I could have been there
What if you use 2pc 2x +80 em and goo full em? What is the max number of em we can shove to this cabbage?
Day 1 4 xiao’s pls

the more time passes, the longer this videos will be
HELP IVE JUST REALIZED IM NOT SUBBED YET
“DONT GET DRILLED” 💀 💀 💀
I CAME LATE NO
YOU FORGOT THE VISHAP BOSS
Note to self. When using nahida, use characters that can do amazing reactions or else it’s going to take years-
man, how do you manage to find the most incompetent players for these haha
Do scara boss
4 archons when ?
Dude here I was thinking 22 dream solvents is a lot and I just see that u have 100+ 💀💀
HOW TF DID U GET ALL THESE SOLVENT ?!!!!
_the grass is coming for you now_
bro wtf i have nahida on my alt, and im rlly close to getting her on my main.. wish me luck edit: i got her along with dori
wich build is better full em or em,dendro dmg,crit build ?
0:32 People who whale over a thousand dollars for C6 deserves to lose all 50/50s compared to those who just want a C0.
bro said touch grass on a diff level
How about next character u c6 and do this vid. How about do one boss c0 the next c1 after that c2 amd so on?
The grass you touch is virtual-
I only had Nahida for a day and a half. If anything were to happen to her, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself.
U can’t complain about anything being slow since you did 4 collei
When Nahida said she is not good in a fight she was not joking 😂
Do all archons team please!!! Ive been playing them together and they actually work LMAOOO
Me : trying my best on wishing more than 90 pulls and eventually not getting a single Nahida  This dude: c6 nahida  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I just got nehida late last night so I’m glade I got see this I’m home sick so thank you for posting
The boss looks easy to kill why a m I stuck with these twin dbeds agons 😫
Christ over half these fights look like suffering like this, despite having 1 or more C6 Nahidas on the team.
Was really hoping to get into the video but unfortunately. I did not, I did help him kill the dendro cube once tho. It felt like an honour to have Paikon in my world.  Wel, I did kind of make it into the video, the one who requested to join the world when he teleported to mondstat was me.. lol  EDIT: WAT MY TWITCH NAME COMMENT THING I SAID IN THE CHAT GOT IN!!!!!
skill issue
How to get the right builds in advance?  when doing the test run, open the character you’re testing and take a picture of their stats, constellations, artifacts, and weapons
swag like ohio
19:10 You should use the harpastum throwing balloon thing or whatever. You can knock it down and reset the resistance.
why you called dreamnotfound AHAHAHAHAH
nahida is really good as a DPS or support, that’s what I love about her! (Well and the fact she is a cuteeeee)
4 orphans play Dance dance revolution across the remains of the world
Now will be best compitition for who kills hydro Birds faster ...Lisa vs dendro archon,(electro charge vs bloom)
Basically make boss eat veggies
my Nahida erases everything with double electro double dendro team. I love her so much
Summary of this video in one word:  DODGE!
Wait, isnt her burst kinda useless in full dendro teams?? Well, if you have c1 its not that bad
i can't go in co-op for 3 months can you help please?
Hi
I only have one word for u .... Whale
4 archons!!!!
Fr who else loves abbobbie?

Now we need four archons!
when she's the strongest character on ur alt...
You guys fighting jadeplum/cryo flower example of a boss from elden ring
I love how he's still c6ing all archons
This video didnt look as long as i thought it would be. It took FOREVER in the stream, you thing im exaggerating but im not. I actually had something to do and 10 minutes later there still at it! This was prolly the longest 4 Characters lmao. but great video Poko!! Now please give me Nahida ehe<3
Nahida is the most Anti-Selfish character there is :)
Dirt and grass/plant are different though.
6:13 wait AYO
I was waiting for this
"Don't suck me","It's gonna suck"~Paikon
Nahida is a great support to my Kokomi and Lisa :o
Paikon i think you just need to tap her e to get energy. You keep holding her e thats why you dont get any energy
this is a masterpice..hope we get an archon team!!
yooooo im in the chat :D
"must be handsome too" KEKW
NOOo this is making me weak , I NEED to save for Hu Tao 😢
/one on fav, one on the prototype and you basically have a healer and a battery
Loved how your chat sold you out.
Bro if you hold nahida skill you can tank
This was so painful. cantwaitfor 4 archons..
Waiting for 4 fischls.
O br agradecendo o lula por pegar a nahida em 5 tiroskkkkkk
That “Don’t suck me” really tickles me. Do you really mean that? 👀😂
Is no one talking about his username being dream not found😃
yashiori island rains forever unless you do a quest to stop that so really you just didn't do the quest for the rain to stop and it happened to help you in this case
I just got nahida at 6 pity from single pulls and got her weapon at 20 pity
I pull for Nahida, I lost the 50/50 it's Tighnari Im sad rn but Tighnari is okay. So I took him.Bcuz its rlly worth it
Next thing you know his title is gonna be “bulling children with 4 wanderers”
I've been waiting for this video since ... Since forever . Or like when nahida got leaked
Next vid should be all 4 archons!
“Im not gonna die, surely”  *not even 2 seconds later*
why your Nahida level 79?
11:11 omg nahida have rotating star?
the very first second don't get drilled
My guy literally had 31 resin the first time he defeated it, the actual first time he didn't have Denzel or elecro lmao
You should do 4 archons
I guess thats why my nahida didnt come home..he took them all..😭😭
When they tell you to go touch grass , but grass is a loli . 🗿
u have so much 5 star compared  to my 4 5 star
“It’s still level one” please lmfao-
Say cheese or die
I'm still waiting for "I sued everyone with 4 Yanfeis"
I think you forgot the ruin serpent
I always found it funny on how he pronounce zhongli’s name
Wait, you got EM Goblet? That's legendary because I've never gotten one
1:42 literally everyone's reactions farming this boss lmao
Ar-kongs
i want to pull her so bad but im skipping her bcs itll ruin my guaranteed scara
Do 4 albedos
ya so lucky i lost 50/50 with qiqi
7:35 the sound though 😂
I'm so bad I'm ar 44 and only do 11k dmg
me: got Nahida right after she releases paikon: bro just C6 her straight away
man shrunk 3 hours of suffering to a 20 min vid
now i know where all the nahida deaths come from
I really like how you didn’t just copy and pasted the same picture of Nahida 4x, instead having all four players lined up together cause a slight shift in perspective which just makes the thumbnail feel a bit more real.
This is what I'm waiting for
paikon " omg i have so little purple books" *me with 7 of the purple ones and 547 red ones*
I got nahida way before you
I've always wondered how your graphics look so different (especially electro effects) than almost everybody playing the game. Is it because of your setup? I'm just curious about that ^-^
The front cover is perfect for once
Vid 6 of asking u to do this with Ganyu
Wha-- c6 nahida?!!
Lord knows I've been waiting forever for you to make this video ❤️
btw you can dogde the time when the are going to like ya know the platfrom use nahida's em to dodge because she floats when every she uses her em

You should recreate the archon war with the archons
I killed all 3 boss in monstad with xiangling and nahida expect andrius or adrius idk
I killed all 3 boss in monstad with xiangling and nahida expect andrius or adrius idk
5:32
I knew you would make a Video like this
and this is the longest run we seen
You can enter low level VV domain to fill yung burst faster.
as a dps nahida user, i can now say that i have a phobia of dendro cores
Still waiting for Yanfei vid😔. "Creating a new law with 4 Yanfei"
Except for paikon he has incredible luck. Talk about getting blessed by mihoyo
Why do you need characters when you have traveler with all elements. As a traveler main i am truly dissapointed in all of you p2w
Got her first 10 pull on a new account
The moral of the story is to use Nahida with reactions
EGGS
2 Nahida and 2 Klee - I burned Teyvat with Jumping Dendro Archon and Jumpy Dumpy.
Not abbobie malding in chat
Still waiting for “I put qiqi in her grave with 4 hu taos”  When hu tao re run btw I have been waiting so long lmao
Please do the 4 archons in your world 🙏🏻
14:28 "wheres the baguette GOOOO!"
The only time paikon doesnt stress when trying to kill oceanid
Paikon dying every time the geovishap spits water.  One person in chat : "B00BS" (in rainbow letters)
I can’t wait to be in his four archons video
I have a gpitch tjat my ar can't go up
Nahida is just Qiqi with a buff 😭
YESS I HAD BEEN WAITING
“I killed an npc with 4 Tsaritsa’s”
Tbh, she does more dmg then I can from taking pictures
I wasn’t planning on getting Nahida, but I caved and spent $260.  I lost my 50/50 to Jean at 80 pulls, and then at the next 80 I got a double Nahida in 1 ten pull so… I guess I got my money’s worth lol
I spend 15 dolars por 1960 genesis cristals and I got 12 pulls +the comission and the 7 f2p wishes thath I had got 20 wishes and now I am at 76 pity wish me luck on the 50/50
Tbh if there was just one raiden to use her skill so everyone can use reactions
When The Wanderer comes out : "I unleashed endless fantangos with 4 Wanderers"
Due to your video I got nahida now
PAIKON IF YOU DON'T CLAIM YOUR REPUTATION REWARDS I SWEAR TO THE GODS-  ALSO ABOBBIE HAD PROTOTYPE AMBER AND 4 PIECE CLAM SET DURING THE CHICKEN FIGHT LMAOOO
"The hardest boss for the goddess representing life are the flowers who could have guessed"
She’s amazing against the Hydro cube
I love these videos
HOW DOES YOUR NAHIDA DO SO MUCH DAMAGE?!?!?!!!!!?!!!11
Moral of the video: nahida is a wonderful reaction support, but a vegetable at everything else
That moment "Ten Ten" means Penis in Filipino HHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I lost the 50 50 early so I could get her but I won’t pull I’m saving for yelan rerun and I have a crap ton of time her banner ain’t gonna pop back up for a while
Fun fact:you cab use nahida's skill to grab far distance items so you don't use the clicks maybe you can use it to collect the orbs
Wheres All Xinyan and All Ganyu and all the other chracters can u do this with ALL Chracters plsssss
wtf makes your vfx look like that
Paikon i have an idea for the next time you do 4 characters: instead of always switching builds just do the bosses first where you have to use physical damage and then do all the bosses where you can do it with your normal build
all archons next!!!
For who doesnt know in the live after 4 nahidas paikon DID 4 ARCHON AND IT WAS 52 MINUTE RUN XD
"We reinate Archon war with 4 archon" next title maybe 🧐
Finally!i'd been waiting for this!!!!
STOP TIMAEUS
its so hilarious how long this took 😂 she really does work best as a team player instead (where she can make reactions)
Nahidas the games WORST playable charter and god
YES ALL ARCONES DO IT PLS AND LIVE ON YOUTUBE PLS
Lmao paikon always find ways to make things funny
wheres the pulling video :(
My favorite f2p YouTuber
There are only two things I look forward to when there's a new character coming out.  1. Having to pull for the character 2. itspaikon new video
next would be 4 childes or 4 scaramouche!
fight all the domen bosses too again
Should have been - i stomped the world to death with 4 nahidas
Don't get drilled! Amazing
“I see everything!” *sees search history* *”Ive seen everything.”*
Why do all the people doing coop with him are all brain dead?
Are you a whale?
Full Archon Run when?
am i the only one that realizes nahida is like a keyboard cause she presses on a key for normal attack and for charged attack you can see a mouse that drags open the box like the windows desktop
“I deleted the world with 4 archons” I think that will be the tittle for doing 4 archons
man didnt use a pyro character to farm the dirt block *WHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZEEEEEEEEEE*
I would say take a shot every time he dies but I don’t want to be responsible for people dying of alcohol poisoning
This is child paikon
The nahidas sounded like nya iya nya 😂
Watching this video to double my luck when wishing for Nahdia (hopefully)
why are you dream not found did I miss something
an our late
Me: failing to get nahida and watches this video Itspaikon: "I have 6 of these so let me just level them up" Me:**internal pain**
Me who pulled nahida in 10 pulls and jean in literally the next 10 pulls with 0 pity... Now i have Guranteed for the shogun. Thanks Mihoyo       (Anyways. That's a block of grass.)
Abobbie definitely said they went off to read smut😭 my icon.
THERES ENOUGH ARCHONS TO CREATE A WHOLE TEAM
I have a challenge only use geo traveler and venti it will be a walk in the park if you got the right artifacts and a weapons
Wait dosent nahida damage scale of elemental mastery
The burst gives a attack boost
It's funny coz if there was even a cookie in the team , the bosses would have been annihilated
Idk
I just realize someone mention on chat
Next video:I started another archon war with four archons
Yay I was waiting for this!
C'mon
paikons videos are so enjoyable they feel like 5 mins when instead they’re like 20+ mins 😭
Interesting idea: as soon as Miko came out my friends and I did an all “furries” run with Gorou, Sucrose, and Diona. You could probably replace Gorou with Tighnari and it would make a decent team
shorties x4
I love this
I'm waiting for "I killed all children with 4 Hu Tao's"
Nhida;s
watching this on twitch was so painful, i went to take a break from the stream for a bit and when i came back he was still on the same boss
since when did nahida need scaramouche boss items? 🤨
*A new character gets realised*  Bosses: *Not the four characters challenge.*
DID I HEAR A '' QUE ISSO''?
omg the amount of world bosses we alr have wirh 4 nations 😥
Nahida actually became my first 5 star at AR 41
Bro abbobbie dipped 💀
paikon, when childe reruns can you do 4 childes? :D
I’ve been waiting for this video. Like I pulled her and all I could think about is this video and when it comes out
yeee
do all dendro chrs after all archons :)
The fact the Dendro hypostasis will always be impossible
i HATE nadhia
When am i nexted?

Our little grass baby makes everyone touch grass

Noice
"With the power of f2p magic."

Watching him kill the cryo regi on stream 😭
i dont know how i managed to get here relatively early
Yes the best archon no one is better than nahida
i've been waiting for this video since nahida got released :D
26 MINS EARLY!
As Nahida main this makes me happy
If one was a Dori just for electro app it would be at least 50% faster, Nahida really is the ultimate reactor character lol
u dont know how painful it was watching you kill that cyro flower on stream
Paikon you should solo all bosses w barbara
he had ultimate skill issues here 😭
slay.

As someone who watched the stream when he did it, it was painful to just watch hp slowly decrease when it took so long💀  It is probably one if not his most longest 4 characters so far  so yea quite painful to watch it all💀
