I'm coming back yet again to watch your colorado series. Especially after seeing you're giving the house to your family is so amazing. Seeing them love the house so much back then, and now they get to live and enjoy it for you guys?!? I'm emotional for you guys, and I'm so beyond happy. I know I'm just a random person to you, but I've been following you guys for so long and can't help but let you know how much you've empacted my mental. I can't wait to see you guy's future blossom and be full of love and family 💚 can't wait to see the new studio as well!
Rewatching in 2025 🥰
Girl I'm crying
Coming into the comments 3 years later…..I love seeing all of the positive comments for Shane. He went through such a rough time and I’m so happy to see him finally getting to come out of it!! I love Shane!
Rewatching because i need some Colorado vlogs in my life. Please don’t sell this house!
Anyone else here in 2024 just in need of a good nostalgic series?? 😅
I stand by what I said. Mama Vicky should get the house in Colorado along with Bruce and grandma. It’ll be perfect for them to live out their years on a beautiful property and it stays in the family ❤ since recently you’ve been mentioning selling.
Ryland and Shane, I'm rewatching your old vlogs and seriously can't get over how GORGEOUS and dreamy this house is. THIS is your home!! Pleaaasee go back to her in Colorado ❤
Morgan’s manifestation is so strong , within the first 4 minutes  she  talks about them moving closer and this being the house they’ll move into , the neighbours llamas and becoming an aunt. Watching this three years later knowing they got the house, and the llamas and the babies
Rylands dad is such a green flag
So I’m watching this in 2024… and I wish Shane and Ryland would sit down together and watch this video… I really believe that yall are going to regret selling the Colorado house😭
Y’all cannot sell this house. ❤❤❤
Your boys need to be hear. As a mother of 2 boys, I would pick hear to raise them.
I can’t wait to see your boys here  I love both houses  I’m so happy for you both ❤
Watching this in 2024💗🫶🏼
Watching this 2 years later and am just heartwarmed at all the memories Shane and Ryland have created on this house. As they are moving around ooing and ahing, I can see Shane running down the stairs to show Ryland and us his office and making sure to twerk on the wall for us! Lol..or see Ryland desperatly try and make the Lucky Charms cheesecake or when Shane thought his jacket was on fire while he was sitting in front of the fireplace in thw loving room! Lol, these videos have been the most loving, sweet, and entertaining videos I've ever watched (including LA house 😊).  So happy for you two (now four! Squee!). ❤️
Bring those babies in Colorado
Shane"look at the swing it's the scream swing!" Classic Shane 🤷🏻‍♀️
it would be so cool to watch Ryland on show like dream home makeover! I loved watching the whole process!
Little did they know, those alpacas were gonna be theres
Little did they know those would one day become their llamas! 😊
Am I crazy (yes) or does Shane sound like Julian sometimes when he talks????
Shane has blossomed so much in this home. I know Ryland misses LA, but this home has become such an important place in their lives. Their LA house is just that, a house. This CO house is a home. So happy for them and Morgan with the place they’re at in their lives right now.
Watching old videos because I need entertainment and we dont have a new video yet
Love Colorado for you both it's been so good for you both
Little did you know that those llamas would be yours! I love seeing you guys fall in love with your home and all the excitement everyone has in buying a new home!
Y’all r making me cry 😅 seeing y’all fall in love instantly 😊 ❤
I think it's time for Shane Dawson to move to his new home la is okay but there's nothing much else in LA I think it's time for Shane Dawson to move into his new home
Awwwww I'm so proud of Ryan's dad saying "at least I'm a democrat" 😭
This house was $1,699,000.00. Their LA home was $3,400,000.00
love u guys !!!
Sold! Has the wow factor right when you walk thur the door.
In Florida that’s a Christmas tree not a pine tree . Should google what a pine tree looks like.
Your LA home cost twice as much as this?? Dang. I knew LA was expensive but THAT expensive?! It was a beautiful unique house in LA but dang. I'm happy yall decided to move to Colorado. You seem so much happier in Colorado.
THIS HAS BEEN A YEAR WTF
@9:49 shane- "this is like where you go when the tornado comes..." little did he know! [Here watching all ryland's old vlogs cause i want more shane content!
I'm so happy you get the farmhouse... That's the dream
And that house would be a third of the Colorado price in Nebraska. I couldn't believe the price difference when I moved from Colorado to Nebraska.
I am so happy for them that they ended up getting this house. Life is too short not to live in your dream home, yaaaasss queen !
this video fr changed my whole perspective on what would be my dream home. even all these months later I feel like it's still the most gorgeous house I've ever seen. the pure warm and welcoming cozy vibes the basement alone gives.. just picturing endless movie nights wrapped up in comfy blankets! genuinely this is the true definition of a dream home and I'm so happy that ryland and shane were able to make it theirs
PERIOD MR ADAMS
This was making me emotional for some reason 😭
Looking forward to them coming back here!
Love this
I love it and I'm not even living there?! can you adopt me or something so I can move in LMAO
I always forget how city slick Shane is, but it really comes out here lol. It's a nice looking place :)
As a Mile High native welcome to Colorado
it's so exciting that u all moved here to colorado❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
House goals
can I live with y’all I can be y’all’s twink 😭😖😖
Such a feel good vlog. Wishing you all the best for the future :) 😍😍😍 ( I'm also placing a preorder for an alpaca jumper and some socks - Size Medium :) 🦙😂🦙
I see a lot of youtubers and content creators moving away from LA and it shows how it's had a dang good effect on their lives and mental health. Go and be happy ❤️
Stunning home. I wish you guys didn’t show the panic room though 🤨
M so late in the game but woooooow
Omg it’s beautiful I’m so jealous!
6:03 guys... It's not even a pine... It's a spruce....
Now that’s a house!!  I would pick this everyday over LA. LA seems so toxic to me and I just don’t think it’s worth the stress now, at this stage of your careers. Get out and enjoy :-)  Life’s too short to be worrying what the vapid Courtneys from LA thinks of you at every moment of the day. Be with the normal people xx
I want to live there
Stunning
I vibe to the intro so hard 🦗
Rylands dad saying “at least I’m a democrat”
13:10 SHANET
Just an FYI Colorado is actually the least overweight and obese state in the US. Don't know what y'all are on about.
I can’t believe your Dad said he is a Democrat out loud!
Very pretty house...very big too
https://youtube.com/channel/UCeRqkr_RoDm02iNVX-82g3w
16:15 Maybe liberals in Cali are crazy when it comes to taxes?
Just fell in love with their dad when he checks to see if his cowboy hat is blue!!🤣 "Well at least I'm a Democrat!"
These vlogs are sooooo relaxing to watch :)
Feed your fishies
I love it!  And how Shane went from, “what’s going on??” To: “I wanna live here, I wanna live here!” <3
I'm so sorry but if you don't remember when Shane Dawson told us the story of him and his mom looking at houses on an open house and he grabbed a cookie and they couldn't buy the house cause they couldn't afford it and now he's walking around in a new house wondering if he should buy what a full circle moment I'm crying
I'm sooo looking forward to watching you begin your family and all the new and exciting fun on the farm!
It remind me of the neverland ranch
please let me live in the barn and take care of the farm animals that you will eventually have. 20yrs of horse/farm animal experience (and a vet tech) ;) BUT in all seriousness, congrats on finding a dream property, you guys will have so much fun growing your family there.
This is the coziest house I’ve ever seen id live the rest of my life here 💕🥺
Laughs in 2 bed 1 bath South West Sydney, Australia. Bitch even our rich houses don't look like that LMAO 😅😅😅
What a beautiful house
Ah man.. I thought Rylands dad was smarter than that
I'm crying my dream house!
I'm just here in Europe, my apartment literally smaller than your garage haha
LITERALLY my dream house. Hate you guys 😒 but congrats!!
okay but morgan is GLOWING
i'm so happy they moved. L.A. was ruining their lives, to be honest with you.
you and shane seem so happy and i'm so fucking glad you're both posting this content. i've been watching shane since 2008 and he's the happiest i've ever seen him as a youtuber viewer. keep going ya'll i support you!!
I’m obsessed with rylands dad! he’s so sweet 🥲
When they realize all Democrats do is destroy the country ....oooooof
Rylands dad is amazing
Your joy is coming through the screen.
awesome 👏 great 👍 to be around family it’s all u need in life!!
i knew i saw you guys at my local starbucks
I would help Morgan with those babies I promise 😍 I got good genes 🧬
They are building a Trader Joe's next to Costco!!!
I live 3.8 miles from you..lol!  Just off Pine Lane...
That is beautiful 😌 ❤
I think this house was also an event house if it's the house I am pretty sure they also hosted funerals
Ugh such a gorgeous house! I would kill for that house.
The second Shane said “that looks like the scream swing” I got an ad for the new scream movie! Wtf that was kinda weird lol.
I’m jealous this is something i didn’t know I needed but now I want
Watching this after I’ve watched them in the new house and I’m still excited to see this video. I was here for Shane but Ryland has stolen a little bit of my heart too 💜 Awesome video, congrats you guys !! It’s a gorgeous home 😍😍😍
😂😂 she can definitely do 7, my grandma had 13
Im black and i still love you shane😍
I get why they moved because moving and starting a new chapter in life is always amazing
that's what every californian says when they move to other states buying houses jacking up cost of living.. ugh
Ryland’s dad is the best 🥺😭
The lights in the kitchen look like the squid games pigy bank
Listen listen.... Can I come live in the barn apartment?
I'm so happy for y'all
Weird y’all chose Parker... I’d say y’all would fit in Boulder better
I’m so in love with Ryland’s dad 🥺 he’s so amazing
Love that they think it's cheap but it's actually not...California is just ridiculous.
Okay but I was so sad to see in Shane’s new video how this beautiful pond is now brown. 😭
Petition for Shane to post something... I miss him
I am LIVING for there pure joyful moments. There happiness warms my heart for the cold winters. I’m glad they are happy. 🤍🤍🤍
Awhhh your dad 🥺 he is the sweetest
Isn't she an aunt already? Their brother...
the panic room lmao how cool
Seeing the relationship between Shane and Ryland's dad is so sweet.😍
It has always been my dream to move to CO. with my dream tiny home until the time comes when we need a bigger family home. I want both to be on a farm. Your home is beautiful, I am so happy for you two. Y'all deserve the absolute world. I was honestly brought to tears seeing this. I love y'all. 💛
I would love this for them
I just exist in the dump I live in being disabled and ill I would give anything to wake up one day and say I'm going to buy a piece of heaven. I will never have that in this life. So for Shane and Ryland who can do it, if they don't then what's going on with their lives.  Half the price  they could get a small place as a LA base.
It is soooo beautiful and I’m so happy for you guys. What a dream ❤️
Me at the start of the vid: if this house has a panic room for Shane then it's definitely the one 12 mins later: shows panic room Me: 😍
I'm not super keen on the thought of Shane and Ryland owning horses. It just feels incredibly impulsive. Also Shane and Ryland don't seem to come off as horse people at all. I just can't see them waking up early in the freezing cold, and going out to pick up horse manure and picking hooves. They are so used to the luxurious lifestyle of LA, and going from that to living on a farm in Colorado with horses is such a huge change. I have a feeling they will buy some overpriced horses that never get ridden. And if they decide to ride the horses, the horses will most likely be incredibly fresh and end up bucking and bolting. My advice, stick to tractors. You don't need feed/clean after those....
Omg so fucking gorgeous. 😭 Blessing to y'all
"at least I'm a democrat" omg we stan. I love it!!!
I love how Shane interact s with the family it’s so warm and fuzzy
But like what about Shane’s mom
So proud of you and Shane
So glad y’all got OUT of Los Angeles.  Sell your LA house soon. Being around family and away from toxic LA is only for the best. Good Luck. Morgan is right. Being down the street from her with matching tractors would be amazing. Congratulations!!!!
Where’s Debbie?
It’s a sign……and a horse
So much more homey, and peaceful feeling! Better quality of life being out of LA!
Your dad is a sweetheart.
I miss you shane
Between this and Morgan's vlogs, Dad is my favorite character.
“At least I’m a Democrat”. I love this!
Where in Colorado! I’m from Colorado Springs!
There is not a more perfect house.  It's beautiful
I'm here for you two doing vids!! Also I normally don't watch vlogs, but only for you guys!
Get the house, get out of CA
This just made my whole day <3
You guys should get some ducks!
Okay be nice to dad just trying to participate and mention their friend brad lol. That was she cutest moment
Omg 😩🥺 I fuckin LOOOOOOOVE it!!!  Move already 🙏🏽. U guys r ready for this change 👏🏽👏🏽 best of luck🤞🏽🍀. Literally EVERYONE just looked so happy.  I love u guys
Never forget that most of us have been around since the beginning of Shane, and you two, and we enjoy YOU GUYS not the glitzy shmancy LA stuff - you two are the magic we come back for.  I can't wait to see kiddo vlogs and sledding down that hill and imagine the FALL VIEWS you'll have on that patio... Can't wait to see it along with you!
You need to have pigs 😍🐷
"at least im a democrat" hahahah
If yall get horses u have to let me come ride 🙄😂😂🥰
ok the outside is giving ranch but the inside is somewhat giving beach house
That house is absolutely stunning.  I can feel the calm and relaxation from seeing the video 🥰
Never ever show how much you love the property cuz then you're negotiating will go out the door
Morgan is such a little sister haha 💕
Ryland and Shane just a tip, you shouldn't vlog in 60fps. Its very dizzy if you keep moving around filming in 60fps...
HI SHANE I MISS YOU!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hi Ryland …congrats on the beautiful home. It’s so nice to See You guys again and I’m happy to see you happy! Also, can you tell Shane we miss him and we want him to come back! We need some new conspiracy videos!
Brad after watching this video: 😎
The house just fits them. To me it reminds me of their old house a lik (the inside) the office is soooo Shane’s!
Can I live in your guest house or?
Welcome to my state Colorado, by the way I miss Shane I wish he would come back to you tube! 🙏🏼😇💖
I have the same glasses as Rylands mom. I’m rich. 🤣
Okay the camera quality tho ✨🔥
Rylands dad looks so emotional watching them fall in love with this house knowing his son will finally be closer 😭❤️
May I bring to attention that in this video Shane says: This is where we go for tornados.   And the new vlog is titled: First Day in New House *Tornado warning*   Conspiracy: Shane has secret powers,  and I refuse to believe otherwise.
WTF? Really you are moving again!! WTF? Thank you for sharing!!
your mom was so funny at the end omg
650. I love that sign!!!
No hate, but was Shane born and raised in California?? 😂🤣
ok COMPLETELY unrelated but before this vid i saw an ad for jets pizza and now im starving v much craving it but i cant order bc its three in the morning where im from and everythings closed 😭 dont yall just hate when that happens?? also the new house is fucking adorable!!
Even through the screen I can just feel how peaceful it must be there
SHANE: WHAT IS THAT?  UMMM.. A POND lmfaooo "A CHRISTMAS TREE'  MORGAN: SHANE, THATS A PINE TREE .. IM DYING HAHA
The barn… can be the shed!!! 💋
If Shane wants his career back, he should cut a deal with Weight Watchers.
Would Shane's mom move out there as well?
where’s Shane’s mom? Haven’t seen her in a while hope she’s included in all the grandma honor 🤷🏼‍♀️
Excuse me but if Shane doesn’t bring back his conspiracy theory videos in that office I might just explode!!!!!
Heaven!!!
Looks beautiful definitely my dream home. I love the country life
Hire a cameraman please or a stabilizer. Couldn’t finish the video. Got wayyy too nauseous 🤢
This house is perfect!  Would love to own something half as nice 😭
I'll be your surrogate. Already did it once with twin boys. Why not again. Would love to carry for you. The house is gorgeous!
That's so crazy, the kitchen setup is so similar to your current one
Shane here?
Definitely a good decision for them to move in Colorado. Away from bad vibes and everything.
Shane really manifested his first tornado!! 9:52!
God I miss Shane. I am having such a hard time emotionally with both of my high risk parents testing positive for covid and I just needed the break that Shane gives me I haven’t had that in such a long time.
Fuck LA! This is way better.... you guys deserve better than LA
It is so so amazing 🖤🖤🖤🖤
WHAT TOWN/NEIGHBOURHOOD IS THIS? IM TRYNA MOVE THERE 😩
I love Shane and have missed him so much
I can just imagine Christmas in that house. It looks like it suits u guys so well (-,:
Sooo pretty omg
LA house, think Golden Handcuffs, Colorado House, think Family ❤️🌿
The fact that he said “If a tornado comes”, and had to use it for a tornado as soon as they moved was some crazy manifestation
Oh my gosh! I watched the “We bought the house!” Before this one and it was sooooo rewarding!!! So happy for you guys!
Does anyone know the song in the beginning? 😅
Can I just say how happy it makes me feel to know that Shane found his person? Like you can tell that Ryland makes Shane so happy. ❤️
After Shane’s career died they couldn’t afford to live in their Cali house anymore
Damn, the house is a fucking dream and amazing. I wish I was wealthy omg
So happy for you both 🥲
Omg! Shane & Ryland!!! I'm so happy for you! It's absolutely gorgeous! I hope I can have this one day! Childish Colorado is absolutely amazing! I love Colorado! Edit; I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!
Pewdiepie didn't do justice to the review
Morgan is such a mood “we’re going to have matching tractors!!”
The camera is making me dizzy
Nice house pick. 🏡 I could live there too really easy. I love the kitchen window, I like the game room, I like the washroom, the nature is beautiful and sunny! It's furnished nicely. I agree. I'd chose those house colors too on the inside. Very comfy and friendly. The knick-knacks! Lol! Amen. 🐈 Cheeto!
Is the frame rate weird on this or is it me? Seems too high maybe
lol! The room that you called a basement is called a den! The room that you called the actual basement is called a basement! XD And doors that have two pieces to them are called dutch doors! :D
That house is absolutely beautiful 😍
I thought they moved not long ago..WELL MUCH LOVE FROM MINNESOTA!
when you know you know like my hubby and me we knew. congrads
Must be nice.
Aww I love the house it's so beautifully decorated 😭 I love that Ryland's family is like Shane's surrogate family, since he doesn't seem too close with his own
So excited to see Shane again! It’s time! You too Ryland obvi!
Please dont buy a horse unless you do your research. Horses are very expensive and require a lot of work, DAILY. A lot of the times when people who dont know anything about horses buy a horse the horse ends up getting neglected, and the owner eventually sells them, but in the end a lot of horses actually end up at the kill pen.
I live in Colorado I’m so excited I hope I see you guys around maybe meet up and do fun videos
Why am I crying
is no one going to talk about rylands mom talking to shane when she sits him down and they have an amazing conversation 🥺
🖤🖤
I have never been more happy for two ppl in my life xxx go guys..
ryland HAS to have filtered comments i stg why is no one talking abt this
*me watching*  *ryland shows backyard*  "Ohhhhh the dogs are going to love that"
If shane finally posts a new conspiracy video, I‘d definitely watch that and I‘d love it but I‘d still give it a thumbs down bc he dared to come back
so happy for yall☺️
I miss Shane so much.
that kitchen looks so similar to their current kitchen with out the extra bar on the left side
Shane and his nick nacks
I love it
Meanwhile, most Americans can't pay their rent... and the moratorium is ending soon and unemployment payments are cut.
this makes my heart so happy, I feel like this is the perfect house for you both! It has everything you want, it's super peaceful unlike LA, you can have horses, the dogs can rome around, it was designed to be I teared up thinking about the beautiful things the future holds for you both and I'm so excited to see you two get married! Also I LIVE FOR THE MATCHING TRACTORS, the office is perfect for Shane it reminds me of his conspiracy theory office! Shane needs a fresh start away from everything and Colorado is the perfect place for him to do that, he seems happier in Colorado, I wish nothing but the best for you two It makes me so happy to see everyone so happy in your family! sending all of my love!
I am so fucking happy for you, your dogs are gonna be in dog heaven seriously <3
So beautiful I can feel the good energy from here sold
HES SO BIG????
Grandma just chilling 😆
let me stay in ur guys barn i’ll pay you guys and you guys won’t know i’m there lmao
It will cool one day Shane and Ryland become parents one day. And they can go sledding down the hill. It will be so awesome. The house looks stunning and the yard looks beautiful
Yay! Congratulations you two! Welcome to and back to Colorado! Hope to run into you some day and say hey!!
Hey Shane I know you won't respond to this but me and my bestie Eva loves your channel and you .🔥💋❤💯
Okay, the house is really beautiful, I am so glad you got it! Are you going to move Teresa to the guest house over the barn? 😅
Omg 😭😭 I’m so happy for you both♥️♥️🎉🎉
omg that house is SO beautiful!!
UHMMM HELLO ! THIS HOUSE IS WAYYYY BETTER THAN THE ONE IN CALI, IM SUPER HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS, I WANT TO CRY !
Pov: you’re here from that tiktok
I live super close to you… if you wanna go on some cool adventures let me know!!!!
I could fr drive to shane dawsons house,holy shit
I hate that I have to watch the most annoying person in the world's channel just to watch Shane but oh well
literally what
who else is here from that tiktok 💀
Wtf why are all of the comments supportive, did y'all forget who the monster is????
I’m here from that tiktok lmao
Are they married yet?
Why are there no hate comments?
Give me address im in Colorado, boulder to be exact.
Your family are such darlings! Seriously I feel like Morgan and I would be best friends🤣
Shane could do his conspiracy theories in that office room! If he brings it back.
What about Shane’s Mom.
not them moving 5 minutes away from my house…….
Do not get horses unless you can groom, clean , and hire someone. They are a lot of work.
hey shane 😊😋🥰 I said come to mama sit on down 😠😒👇
NO DO NOT SAY YOU LIVE IN MY TOWN
This is such peaceful home.Truthfully, I prefer them to stay in place like this compare their previous house.
Living on a farm would be EVERYTHING. I’m so happy for you guys!!!
Love ur realtor 😂
I’ve watched this vlog so many times now that most people would think it’s unhealthy. But. They bought my dream farm house! So freakin happy for them!
WOW!!!! Beautiful farmhouse w a breathtaking view!!!
Hi ryland how are you
The house is pretty but the paint is so dark. I am so glad that they got out of la and have found a happy place for them to get a fresh start. Country boys now hehe
I love his dads reaction and I love that they can experience this together as brother and sister. Beautiful
I think this move is a great idea. Even in this vlog Shane seems more comfortable and like himself. LA is toxic and everyone knows it, so I’m excited to see him away from all that and able to be out somewhere that gives y’all space to focus on each other and your family. And I’m sure you’ll be more comfortable being so close to family again, and I’m sure it’d help Morgan too. All around it seems like such a good house in a good area and a fresh start will help everyone involved. Y’all deserve to have a nice place away from the city where you can find peace 🤍
Love that y’all bring your animals with you and have a house full of animal babies 😊I’m super excited for the fall and winter Ryland Vlogs 😍👏can I rent your barn room?! I’m totally awesome and a good asset to any family 😂
Ill miss the old one 😭🥺
May I stay in your barn guest home ?! ❤🥰🤪😁
Man I want to watch shane and Ryland:the simple life lol Good luck guys!
The Adam's family is a bunch of wholesome and normal family!!!
That's awesome!!!! Happy to see you guys happy! Now you guys can do more cooking videos
NAHHHHHH I LIVE IN COLORADO THIS IS TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT
goosebumps the whole video. soooo happy for yall
Lol we all know the panic room now
Love it! That’s definitely a family home
Congratulations guys what a wonderful home you'll make and beautiful property to enjoy. Just add kiddos! In your own time of course. 💝🙏💝
What about Shane's mom?
I love seeing Shane excited and happy about life! I think it would be so beneficial for him to get out of toxic LA culture !!
What about Shane's mum 😢
Omg just finding your new channel. :)
Visit in the winter
I am SO happy y’all moved out here. it’s so nice out here, and it’ll definitely be a fresh start for you guys here. also when morgan was talking in the car I realized y’all drove right past my apartments 😭 that’s crazy!!
Is no one going to talk about Kris “The Sticks” edit casually popping up!?!? 😂😂 the best part! Lmfaooo.
THANKS!!! You paid $500k over the asking price. Yet again another example of California people ruining the housing market for hardworking people in other states. I get you worked hard for it but don’t be financially stupid and cause a ripple effect that harms all of us living here already trying to afford homes.
i’m so proud
My god I can’t wait to see the trees during fall the colors the backdrop looks so stunning and to live and experience it every day is like a fairytale 🧡🧡🧡
I am soooo in love with this place! 😍 Serious goals 🥰💕 Imagine all the fun videos you can make in this new place with all that space and all that land 🌨☃️🛷🏞🛶🏕💫🏡🌳🐶🐴
Ahhhh saoooo cute!!!
Kitchen Furnitures so dated
Get ducks for the little pond
I miss Colorado so much!! Born and raised but moved away last year. The food is definitely so much better. Specifically the Mexican food lol
Bogos binted?
They have nick-nacks...honey we're home! 😂 It's gorgeous & I love that it's surrounded by nature.
That house is absolutely gorgeous 😍😍
shane please come back we need you
Great price, great land, great for the dogs! Unfortunately I don't think they realize how much land maintenance will be nor the fact that the only negative side is that this house is a giant power bill! It's cute but I really do hope that they make the many changes that need to be made! I wish them happiness and I have a feeling that this will actually be good for the changes Shane needs to make in his personal life! Wish them the best but they really should have played it a bit more Kool! MLS price I won't reveal but could have done even better! Good luck 🤞 with everything!
Is Andrew coming with you guys?
i came from the TikTok LMAO
The fact they live half an hour away from me now 🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️
I wish Shane’s mom was included more
I love how real Shane is now
Me living in Colorado and finding out they moved to Colorado 😧🤯
13:10 shanet
I HOPE SHANE DAWSON COMES BACK I MISS THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES
I have come from a tiktok
Welcome to Parker! One of the best kept secrets in Colorado! I'm the local rattlesnake relocation expert, if you need any help reach out!
I like how it was rylands idea to look at the house and now Shane’s even more excited than he is 😂
Way to go brad!! Thank you for being a good guy!! We need more goos people!!!🎉💚💜
When there your neighbors✋✨help✨
I want Shane to post on his channel so bad !!!!! Come back !!!!
My sister lives in Colorado and loves it. Worth the move.
Can you like come back Shane, we miss you 🥲
Lol that’s my neighborhood
Who's here from that tiktok of Shane in his backyard
It's perfect 😍
NOT COLORADO 😀
pov : you’re here from the tiktok 👁👄👁
Wait okay I work for a horse rescue in Colorado (Colorado Horse Rescue in Longmont) if you move here and ever want to come see a bunch of beautiful horses who need homes! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i love living in colorado, welcome back!
Shane gonna need more skin removed soon 🤣🤣🤣
So happy for the both of you! Family is everything. Shane…so happy to see you 🥰
I just want to say i love this channel and i have missed you both so much 💜
Lmao the shittiest people have the best things in life
You used the wrong Hannah Montana flashback
The hundreds of comments saying “ I live in that neighborhood” makes me think 99% of those comments are lying
I miss him
Nah yall stay safe i live 10 mins away from araura
Not yall moving go my state- i- 🧍🏽‍♀️
im here bc of that one tiktok
I really hope they move. Shane really seems like he wants to get out of LA and I really think it’s what they need
pov: ur here from the tiktok
You live 25 minutes away from me
Someone on tiktok lives in the same neighborhood goodbye
two streets down from me. lol.
y’all broke now
Can I get the address
POV you’re here from the tiktok sighting
Shane loves it but it seemed like ryland really didn’t want to move. He likes the l.a stuck up lifestyle.
Get out of colorado
Rylands dad saying at least I’m a democrat. A king.
So weird to watch this, still love Morgan’s energy… miss her with garret. Idk just seems so sad now…
WHERE IS THIS SO I CAN RUN AWAY
I missed shane😭😭
YESSSSS SHANNEEEE IS COMING BACK INTO THE VLOGGGG
Please do not get any horses or ponies unless you have hired professionals to help you EVERYDAY AND EVERY NIGHT. I promise you will not want to put in the physical labor that horses REQUIRE to maintain their healthy, happiness, and comfort.  Horses are SOOOO MUCH WORK, EXTREMELY expensive, and easy to kill If you don’t know what you’re doing.
No words aside from WOW.
Wow
Looks like it’ll blow over with a bit of wind x
Youtube didn't recommend no Shane/Ryland vidoes for a good YEAR so why tf is this bullshit on my feed now👁👄👁
I THOUGHT SHANE WAS DEAD WTF
are we really just forgetting all the shit shane did?? who gives a fuck if he's 🥺 happy how uwu 🥺
LMFAO WHOS HERE FROM THE TIK TOK WITH THE GUY THAT LIVES IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
VERY MUCH POVERTY
he broke now so he gotta downgrade 😭
get away
please do not move here.
Hide yalls pets
It's nice Ryland would be back home, but Shane, with his reaction to everything THIS is where he's meant to be. 😭 saying he's never fished and to have their own pond😭 this, this is a home.
ew
So he is making videos again
pls
When this is 15 minutes or less from your house 😳
Moving away.
Who came from the girl saying they live in her neighborhood🧍🏽‍♀️😭
Tell SHANE to come back
1:00 pls don’t
shane don’t come back and it isn’t safe to come back
i live 12 minutes from here
Shane it's safe to come back please come back
Its gona be so beautiful, First Christmas and First snow...
its so weird hearing and seeing shane in videos again
haha broke
Here after finding out they got the house and SO HAPPY FOR THEM!!!
Did y’all see the guy who found where this house is on tiktok lmao
Glad shane is up and around ! Your too cool.. be yourself love you  Fuck the drama channels make yourself strong and happy. Mushrooms lol.
Honestly I’m so glad that a lot of YouTubers are moving away from the toxicity and having a semi online presence with less “party culture” and more finding genuine happiness.
*I love the doorknobs*     LOL You guys are so excited,  it's so fucking adorable!!!
I like that the kung fu panda squad is in the basement😂
Love my KING SHANE DAWSON.

I don’t like this house vibe, doesn’t feel like a home. More like an AirBnB farm house that you rent for a getaway weekend.
All the rich people are moving away from California because it’s turning into a lunatic, liberal shit-hole.
Omg I love this I think it’s such a good idea
Hey Ryland if you see this comment can you please tell Shane that we miss him. This video was so good and I hope that you end up with the home it would be so cool that you move to the mid-west. Wish you both the best and the animals. <3
It warms my heart seeing how happy everyone is! Shane and Ryland deserve a beautiful, quiet home. With how close they are to Rylands family it would be so good to live close
Don’t forgot that these two are awful people. Plenty of evidence online of you don’t want to take my word for it.
This made my heart so happy ❤️🥺 sending love and happiness to you Shane and Ryland
queeeeeeeen you deserve this after whats happend to shane, you and the workd you dsddeserve it. i hope you find peace   ps- we neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed shane ack
Jesus loves you all, He can heal your pain if you let Him. Please stay, do not end your life. You have so much to live for - Christ. I love you, Jesus loves you so much more. He died for you, because He can not imagine eternity without you my love. Please give Jesus a chance, He can change you. If you want to accept Him, believe in Jesus, repent of your sin, turn from sin and ask Jesus to let you live for Him. Listen to “Voice of God” on youtube, and preachers Dan Mohler, Todd white, Kathryn Kullmann and Kenneth Hagin😊❤️ I hope to see you in heaven one day❤️
I missed you guys!!!!!
I need a house update
That house is so beautiful
I see Ryland doing a bleach blonde moment
the vibe of the house is amazing & clean. LA is fucked up just move
Wow what a beautiful house
Not you guys buying the my literal dream house
this is the most perfect house and location i've ever seen, honestly! i'd move there in a heartbeat! 😍😍😍
I hope you're life is miserable in you're knew hope
Ryland, Shane, Morgan : "We are going to be farmers."  Me after getting up at 4am, trimmed hooves by 5, and having to clean stalls for hours before lunch : "mmm hmm" 👁👄👁
Can somebody tell me why Shane doesn’t make videos anymore?
Ohw my god.. I would move in a heartbeat. WHAT A DREAM ! To have a house where you can't see nor hear your neighbours . To have pond and can have Horses and goats and sheep and your pets would love it as well. Gosh ! Can you please film there the first Christmas.. i can already see the snow and the lights outside .. omg ! 😱 sorry super excited ! And so perfect for Shane as well. Breathing fresh air and see the silence and finally can relax. BTW that second basement can be changed in to a private gym. Shane his mother can be staying over and be in the Barn having her own place ( God that sounded horrorble if you didn't know what the barn looked like 😳 😅) . Can't wait to see the moving videos and things . Amazing !
Imagine them raising a kid in LA like what is that kid gonna do, dance on tiktok LMAO
Shane you don’t deserve any of this you’re a vile evil  person and u should be ashamed of what you’ve done
Omg I live in Colorado and where they’re moving to I live 5 and a half hours away!😁
If they don't buy this house I call it its mine
It’s got everything!!! Very cool
My bedroom is literally the size of the closet 😂
You have to get married here omg 🖤
The best thing you guys can do is get the hell out of LA. I hope this works out! ❤️
I love you both so much!! congratulations
When Shane Dawson moves into a house you used to party at…
So happy for you guys you’re doing great it’s good to hear how much you’ve grown
Please buy it it’s so perfect for you guys
I expected toxic comments but was pleasantly surprised <3
Who else here to look again now that we know the outcome? 😁
It was so nice to see Shane happy again! Maybe it's the fresh start you both need.
Omg, that house is amazing. Absolutely stunning at every turn. Then the patio outside and the yard, gave me chills… these people are so lucky. I can’t take it!!
They just move In AH I'm so happy 💅
What about Shane’s mom
I swear to God your Dad is the nicest person on the planet
I wish I was rich
Love it. Hope you get it xxx
I love it!!! Pine trees and green everywhere. 🥰🥰
Is Shane coming back to YouTube?
they fall for the dumbest shit.. doorknobs can be easily changed. You need to look at the bones
Omggg I live in Colorado I hope I meet u
Shane please make a come back we miss you 😢
im dying whenever kris jennr pops up🤣💖
Hahahhaha I know exactly where that is! Only an hour away from me. Wait until yall experience our Colorado winters. We'll.. Ryland... your adult life Colorado winter. I wish you both the best if luck! The secret location is safe with me.. my lips are sealed. Other Colorado viewers keep yo mouths shut too! 😉
Wait, I live in Colorado
I hope this house is haunted so Shane can make videos about it
I legit got emotional watching the walkthrough. I feel you Shane, it's perfect ❤️
Shane: "omg they have nick nacks!!!" 🤣🤣🤣 God I have missed you
I kept thinking Jessica was rylands mom at first I was like that’s not his mom then I was like wait yes it is why does her face look wrinkle oh wait that’s Jessica I’m sorry
As pretty as their LA house was it didn’t suit them but this really does! Congrats 🎉
Oh god get tf out of Colorado
Oh wow! It’s such a lovely place. So much peace and love
But like what about Shane's mom and his family? I am getting a strong type of force from Ryland and his family.
i hope you two get it!!
I would love to this a Ryland blog with Shane, Ryland and a lil Shane running around in this house 😭😭😭 mY hearts melting at the thought of it 😩✋
Gorgeous! I got goosebumps!
Ryland do you HONESTLY think you'll be able to adopt a child with Shane's Reputation? Like REALLY?
The post mastes comment was clearly a joke but check the internet availability first for sure!!
Ugh I want to save this video so I can remodel my house to look just like it
I honestly have not watched any of your channels since the drama went down and I finally tuned in and I think this is a beautiful thing but for some reason I don’t feel like Shane is on board and I think Ryland should be very cautious
For some reason you hadn’t shown up on my timeline in so long. and today I saw this. I was in tears. I’m so happy to see you both growing. You both look so happy there. I truly hope this will be your forever home. 🤍
You look like you haven’t taken a shower in weeks 🤢
I dont think there is anything in LA for y'all anymore this move seems like the best choice I think u guys will be happier there
I come here to see shane!!!
Please get married in this garden I beg
I wish Ryland and Shane were my dads!
I WISH SHANE WOULD COME BACKKK
Shane can finaly buy pigs!!
2:36 into the video and my respect for your father 📈📈📈📈
I dont know we could honestly shart louder than shreks wife
I want them to move there and start doing spooky videos again soooo bad
LOVE!!!!
Shane come back to YouTube
If you wait till 40 your kid will be 20 when you're 60....
I got motion sickness SHANE!
shane saying “its literally like dawson’s creek” made me love him 10x more
“at least im a democrat” FELTTTT
the flamingo comment was too perfect lol its meant to be
This home is too fkn perfect this is a dream
“I love everything about it! The door knobs!!!” 😂❤️❤️
Am I the only one who wouldn't have showed the mirror hide away because if one day someone broke in it wouldn't be a safe/secret place anymore.
Praying neither of you gets your hands on a kid. EVER
THIS IS LIKE THE ULTIMATE AMERICAN DREAM OMFG
WHY IS THIS HOUSE EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED? IMAGINE HOW GORGEOUS THE WINTERS THERE ARE GOING TO BE!!! GET A BIRD FEEDER AND HOLY SH** THE DEER WILL COME EAT IT! I AM OBSESSED.
IM NOT CRYING, YOU ARE! ughhh GOALS!
I missed my Shane ❤️
Please tell Shane if he can post more on his cChannel
I am so excited for them!!!! thats the dream
THE HOUSE IS PERFECT
I don’t think Shane will ever age.. lol ❤️🥰
Tbh i didnt know I would miss these vlogs but seeing you guys excited and happy joking around is really great. I’ve been watching Shane since the Fred is dead video and the complete shit storm coming your way after last year was too much. We all do mistakes and I’m happy you guys are evolving and thriving.❤️
On a side note, I miss Shane 😩😩🥺
Love ittt , love the country music
It looks so nice
Okay, now that I know y’all got the house, YAY, but also please turn that closet inside your closet into another panic room and make a vlog about it 😍😍😍😍 that would be everything. Also love y’all so much and soooo friggin happy for y’all!
im so emotional watching this
YESs love that for Shane ❤️and you!!! You guys are awesome so excited for your new possible beginning.
i SWEAR ive subscribed to his channel 927373 times and every month i have to do it againnn ! WHYYY i need ryland in my life!! 😠 ♥️🤣
Shane and his nick nacks 💞💞💞🤣
One word, beautiful
New vibes new energy this 2021
And my 5th time watching lol. Can’t wait for the updates. So freaking excited for you guys. I got bubble guts watching lmao. Jk but still.
Why does Shane always have to be so fucking disgusting & offensive?
"At least I'm a democrat" lmaooooo
I’d carry a child for them I love Shane and ryland x
I honestly am so happy Shane is starting to be more in the videos I have missed you guys so much.
Let’s hope there’s no cats around
After they moved to their current house that's when everything changed, this house feels more like home, buyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyitbuyit
I will pray for you guy's to get the house it is so beautiful and I want you both to be happy after everything you have both been through! Sending love your guy's way!!! 💖🙌
I really hope they get the House 🤞❤
Its gorgeous....you need to buy it with the decor and knick knacks
For shane and Ryland esp shane to find himself … esp all he’s been thru I’m sure his mistakes he could def find himself and be happy but doesn’t shane’s mom live in la. That would be the hard part….
Omg it is gorgeous !!!!
I so wish I could take my kitties with me when I travel! So cute to see your kitty so comfy on someone else's couch!! 💜
Omg your dad was so excited Shane asked him about the house and if it was built well! You can tell he’s excited to have you closer! 💜💜
a sledding hill!!!!
That is a beautiful house. Hate to say it but I think I like this one better than the LA one.
I am so happy for you!
This home screams happiness so happy for you both 🥰
I LOVE it!!!!!!!!
i wouldve thought they'd they look in a nicer area like cherry hills or something
When Shane calls Noahs Ark nick nacks 💀😂
It’s PERFECT😍
Ewww
Dad is already eyeing the fish lol
The house is absolutely beautiful , I hope you guys move in it , and live in a peaceful home, away from The chaos of L.A, also you’ll be srounded by real genuine people and your family will be around all the time as well , it looks like a great place to build a family
They got the house or else what’s the point in posting the vlog! Wow I’m so excited for you two!
Come check out Monument, CO!! I live here and we actually have a Dawson Creek Dr ;)
Speaking of house how’s Shane doing?
Absolutely love the house! Definitely feels like such a good vibe to get out of LA lifestyle - just gonna miss Shane’s mom 🥺 I love you guys and super  happy and excited for you both! ❤️ new chapters 🎉
Everyone is so much happier & glowing!!🥺❤️❤️  Such an amazing house!!!
All these troll accounts and 12 year olds following false accusations and making up false narratives, for what? What the reason? Why do y’all want to ruin a mans life that you don’t even know? And why is the internet allowing this? Yea. He’s made bad jokes, but he’s never harassed,raped,molested, taken advantage,praying on under age. This is Shane Yaw.. What is wrong with GenZ??? Someone help
Hey I live in Colorado and would love u meet u two one day! Love u guys! Hopefully that will be your house hopefully!
This house is not just gorgeous it’s literally perfect oh my god
And you haven’t broken up with your mad man of a fiancé (Shane)
This is genuinely my dream house.  If I planned and built a house…..The only thing I would change is the location of the house meaning I would want it down here in Texas :-)
That office is perfect for Shane conspiracy theories and spooky videos !!!!
Just hearing shane happy just makes me smile so big 😁😁
around like 18:40 Shanes skin looks so pretty
This video was so relaxing. I feel so calm right now. It made me subscribe.  Thank you <3
I miss Shane so much...His shanisms in the background are giving me life😭😭😭😭😭
Did everyone forgot what Shane did?
Not rylands dad talking about a wedding venue. Love a supporting dad 🥺♥️
Shanet
The filming made me so motion sick...
Why don’t you both move out of YouTube 🤷‍♂️
12:45 could put a salt lick out back and see even more deer regularly.
That's my dream house
Love how they brought the whole family to see the house. My favorite moment was when Shane and Ryland were already in love with the house and Morgan is like "I can babyseat!!" 🤣🤣🤣
i love it! im so excited fir you guys it looks amazing!
Omg literally my dream house in my dream location… too bad I’m a broke college student
What an amazing place , just do it !
only watched this for rylands dads comments lmao he’s golden
I look at the house and I think "oh wow I'd love to live there"  and then realize all the upkeep that has to be done and I'm like "ugh never mind" LOL.
Who needs to come out of the closet when you can come out of the mirror lol
I want Shane to make videos again :/
oh shane!!!! I'm so proud of you!!!! I've been watching you since 2012 and I've been here ever since you've grown so much!!! I'm so happy for you!!!! (I'm not crying you're crying)
Without watching the next vlog to see if you got this house or not. I so hope that you do get this house, because believe it or not you do deserve to be happy, and I'm saying this with tears in my eyes. I don't know you at all, but I wish the best for the both of you and I hope all your dreams do come true! Meaning I so hope you get the home.
As long time subscriber of Shanes, I have always just loved him with all my heart. And feel like I know him personally after all these years. Instantly fell in love with you too Ryland. You two are so perfect for each other. And this is the forever home yall need. 💜💜 Well wishes. And sending so much love and good vibes to you two.
This is the best decision for both of you & future family.
Awe im so happy for you guys!!!!!
I've watched this vlog so many times! Super excited for y'all genuinely I can sleep at night knowing y'all got the house!!!
wheres uno
That cedar closet must smell divine! Shane’s Mom could move there too in the guest house or build her a beautiful tiny house. Family is everything!
Dam yall got me liking yall again lol. I do love how close Shane is with Ryland family.
The real question are what happens to the podcast, and any other things based in California
omg i cant wait for you to become a family channel!
I would love to see you in that house!
Who else got emotional seeing them both so happy and excited for their futures here? They both deserve to be so happy
I want to go to the wedding! Beautiful house!
Can Shane please make videos again 😭😭
Shane I am handicapped and from Africa, like born there, and I never thought you were racist. You always came from a place of love and made us laugh at our differences. Thank you, I miss your videos.
When I saw the skeleton in the basement I knew.. this house is for Shane
Shane Dawson, take your power back.
Awww, I miss Shane's videos. Hope he comes back soon.
I love rylands family. They are so loving and accepting.
This is home. It feels like home.
I love city people sometimes. If you can see another house and you're not on gravel roads, you're not in "the sticks" or in "the country".  But I'm excited for you guys!  This house looks AMAZING! Plus, closer to family & lower cost of living! Also, Shane freaking out over the knick knacks was so funny.
Wow I love this house. It has that comfy home feel unlike your LA mc mansion that every *rich person* has.
I am so happy for you all. God Bless you and Shane forever and always. Love you all
Lots of land to take care of, but beautiful home!!!!
Love it 🥰 it’s beautiful home!! Now imagine it snow covered❄️we build custom fishing rods… I will bling them out for you!!!
Maybe just rent a home in Colorado for a little while to see if you want to move there permanently. My guess is once winter hits you guys are out.
I had to re watch this again since they got the house!!! I wanted to see the BEFORE again before they move their stuff in haha
I feel like this is the fresh start they need🥰
I'm so happy for yall and I love y'alls love so much that I actually leave a comment. Yall deserve all the happiness in the world!!!
I feel like u guys shouldn't sell the CA home. Rent it out or list it on Air BnB ... that's extra income it'll basically be paying for the CO house.... IDK but soooo Happy for u guys! Congratulations! We used to live in Denver, well Aurora. The houses are so cheap and big compared to CA and these prices.
Watching how excited you guys get makes me happy
Beautiful house. I live in Colorado now too!  Welcome.
I love how Shane is in the videos more! Sure do miss his channel! He sure has grown!
Shane's mom will have to move next
your dad is so awesome
Apologize to Wi110w Smith, the chi1d your bf exp1oited
Apologize to Abby, the ch1ld your bf k1ssed when she was 12
Apologize to the family of Trayv0n Mart1n
Wait no this is so cute. I love all of this
please dont crowd it up with your tacky knickknacks
I freaking love their dad!!
Lowkey jealous of their new house 😵‍💫 mine is so old and ugly and I’m too broke to fix it up 🥲
Honestly that house fits them so much better. It fits there vibe and everything
Shane worried about postmates lmao
Sooo beautiful
Seeing Shane so close to Rylands dad is awesome. I know he sort of rekindled his relationship with his father but he’s never had a “dad” relationship.
Am I the only one who hate watches them now?
I miss Shane! I love u so much Rowland ur so awesome!
I was going to buy this house but shane out bid me
Morgan's lucky hat worked!🎉🎉
As amazing as the current house is, I definitely feel that this is the right decision for you and Shane
the farmhouse looks sooooo cozy I’m in love.
That would be the best atmosphere to start a family together. LA is not it.
Your home tour video brought me to tears the house is beautiful she seems so much happier I see it in his face what he was doing before really I think he was just doing to do it but here he seems happier he doesn’t have to act he’s being himself I’m hoping 100% he comes back to YouTube and makes more beautiful videos and being himself 100% I am so happy for both of you and your families like I said you guys brought me to tears to see this beautiful home that fits you so wonderfullyI’m so happy for you
Love you two❤️
If you do not buy this home you are out of your mind it is beautiful I see the smile on your faces you need to buy this home raise your family here next to your mom and dad and sister you need to move 100%
Shane please come back to YouTube
What part of Colorado is this?
Uno jumping in the lake and coming out with a fish in his mouth 😂
Im imaging your wedding in this backyard!!
Move move move!!! It’s perfect 🥺
Am I the only that think that Shane should go back to doing videos. Yes there will still be hating people. But I also know that many people that’s support him  would love to see him back. Let the haters hate Shane. We want you back. 💕
That is my dream house.. 😍😍 I love y'all so damn much!! Follow your hearts! I have no doubt y'all will make the right decision. 🖤🖤🖤😘
So excited for you guys. What a wonderful house. The land, the outdoors. And of course the Family, the true meaning of happiness.
i miss you shane
I miss Shane so much. It really warms my heart to see him.
I need an update!!!
LA is toxic just leave
I miss you Shane 😢 wish you would make some videos 💔
It has been soooo good seeing Shane, I have been just eating up every video with him in it.  The home is beautiful guys, and I truly hope that you are able to find something outside LA.  Being away from LA and the toxic environment that is LA I think will be amazing for you both.  Best of luck in your search, I cannot wait until the next video!!
Do it do it do it!!!! Life’s too short, even if there’s a slight feeling to buy it that’s something you can’t ignore. It’s just absolutely beautiful and made for you two🤍
So many boneheads disliking this.. y'all need a Life..
I'd buy that in a heartbeat and make it a permanent resident
Miss u Shane
this house just physically SCREAMS "shane and ryland" i love this
It’s amazing to hear Shane be so happy about something considering how much of a bad place he has been in. This house is just Perfect for them.   I hate to be a party popper but, Just please remember horses are nice to look and ones that do trial rides are nice to ride, BUT it’s a completely different ball game owning one I found out the hard way it was a struggle for me even though I’ve been around them my whole life. Don’t do it just because you can afford it, but if you do learn as much as you can before hand! It is rewarding in the end but it’s hard work, but do what you love if your willing to put your heart and sole into it ❤️
That house was made for them, it's beautiful! Seeing Shane talk with Ryland's father made me wanna see Shane spend time w his father in the new house🥺 hopefully they're still in contact
Literally my dream house
That house is dreamy 😍😍😍
I really hope they get the house. As an Australian though, what makes LA so bad? 😅
I so want them to move. To get away from the toxicity so Shane can go back to being his creative self again. Just how he's so uncomfortable being on camera now breaks my heart.
congratulations you two! live your lives, grow, flourish & better your selves. YOU CAN DO IT anyone who wants to be better can be. Sending love and happiness because you and everyone else deserve to be at peace 💜
Omg I hope you do get this house, I’ll be a tuff or kinda stressful journey but I know you will get through it and imagine the amount of fun and peace you will have to be close to you family love yall
You should buy it if you really want it. You can live here full time when you are ready and still keep your other house when you feel like being in the city.
I am so happy for them and I can’t wait to see what decisions I make and how they make this their home if they do
I moved from Alabama to SC to CO and I too was excited about Christmas trees everywhere 😂
Ok would somebody just get Morgan a tractor already??! SHE NEEDS A TRACTOR.
Bro is this Chenango 😭😭😭👋👋
I know you probably getting down on yourself but you are looking good and healthy so stay working on yourself sometimes we have to revisit stages in life to reinvent our future and address fears.
I love seeing you again Shane 🥺❤️ please come back
Love the pond!
Omg I really hope y’all get the house because when you guys seen it, I seen the happiness in Shane and Rylands face
shane can live a simple life for sure... or you should buy it for your mom hahaha
Omg, you guys NEED to move there!!
cool now move off youtube
What a beautiful home
apologize to the trayv0n mart1n family
apologize to wi110w
apo1ogize to abby
someone alert the local animal shelters!!!
I'm literally about to cry, seeing you guys so happy and excited. Im so happy to the both of you may god bless your soul and heal your heart. It's time for your new chapter. Sending my love from the Philippines ❤️
“CHRISTMAS TREES” 💀 When I moved from TX to WA I said the same thing lol “There’s Christmas trees EVERYWHERE” LOL
This is not a house, its a compound, nor is it a farm. The idea of Shane with children's and animals scares me😯
SHANES MOM COUPD LIVE IN THE BARN APARTMENT UP TOP SO SHE CIUOD BE THERE TOOOOO !!!!!
I love how sweet rylands family is. So genuine.
This place is So Perfect for you guys. If I could visit I could hang out in my NEW Pig Robe that I just got, which I'm totally In Love With !!!!!   I hope you get this house. I know hat you will make it a Home. And a Great place for a Wedding.... 😉❤
STUNNING
I hope yall get it.. that house is BEAUTIFUL!
PLEASE MOVE HEREEE 😻😻😻😻
I think this is going to be for the best. LA is so toxic, get out of there and move nearby your loved ones.
Aaaaand??????
PLEASE do not get horses, you guys know nothing about them. Seeing how your last animal past away you guys aren’t even responsible for a house pet.
so many good vibes in this vid and im here for it
I feel like that’s a perfect house for a family. I think y’all should get it. Plus your closer to family which is always a plus
it makes me so happy to see how much rylands family loves shane
The closet within the closet is a cedar closet.  Cedar helps keep moths away.
I think you both should leave LA.  L.A. suxs and its sooo expensive anyway. Plus if you have a happy and loving family then your dumb for not living close to them. Plus that house omg that house. Lol
I honestly think Colorado would be the best thing for both of you.
Ok you guys have to move to Colorado!
I can't take the suspense, 🤞🤞 it truly is a dream house, I too thought your house was a dream but after seeing this one it's like 🤯🤩
seeing shane happy makes me so happy
That looks like the Colorado flag I makes I can make those
omg that house is a dream!
SHANE DOESNT HAVE TO LEAVE HIS MOM BEHIND IF SHE MOVES IN THE GUEST HOUSE
I wish shane started making vids again
The house is very beautiful.
Good I hope yall get it. You guys will have more privacy, be around people that truly love you and I think it would be great for Shane to live somewhere where he doesn't have to constantly look behind his back. I feel both of you will truly be at peace there.
U even got a mother-in-law suite for Shane’s mom ryland 💕
So which of you YouTubers are going to buy Shane and rylands house 👀👀👀
I moved from Cali when I was 4 but I have lived in that area of Colorado for 19 years and it is such an amazing place and I feel like you guys will love it!!
Hey and the guest house could work as a house for a nanny 😉
y cant we forgive and for get his cancelation ? like damn get over it ,your so sensitive
Hhhhhh sending all the positive vibes in your approval. Im getting emotional seeing how excited everyone was.the house is beautiful. The land is gorgeous!!!!! Hope you get it 💕💕💕🙌🙌🤞🤞❤❤
This house is what I've been building on the simps.. it's a dream
That place looks magical. That’s like my dream home. I hope it works out for the both of you🤍
Shane seems so happy in this video and I love that his body also looks amazing!! You can see his progress. And maybe moving to Colorado means a new start of their lives. Happier and just you know. Love you Shane and Ryland. Keep going !!
I need the next vlog Ryland!!!

Soooooooooooooo happy to see Shane!!!!!!!  Don’t you dare let this world beat you! Your a great guy and deserve happiness
Honestly this was the most comfortable I've seen you guys look in a vlog in a while!! You better have gotten that house 😂  1. Your animals alone deserve that!!!!  2. Did you see your families faces throughout that entire video? Pure joy! 3. Like you said imagine raising a family there with yours right down the street 😭 That's the dream! Fame will come and go but a solid family bond is really all you need ❤️
Where the new vloggggggg :(
The backyard!!🥺🥺
Omgggg, could you imagine? Shane on a tractor!?! Literally, John Deere could NEVER! I hope you guys get to escape California.   This house and the property are fire af 🔥
You guys have to get this place. The vibe feels so unique and special. Getting out of the city really seems like the best thing to do these days, so many people are doing it and have spoken about how much happier they are. Also, being closer to home really heals you, it’s good for the soul
I have never seen a more beautiful place in my entire life!
This house, wow, I cannot think of a better house for you two! It is first of all GORGEOUS, it is so close to family, and so close to nature (the best healer in the world). I see you two getting so much peace there, being able to be who you are but still have so much freedom and nature around you that will be so good for mental health! Wow I absolutely love the house and I honestly cried watching the tour because it is basically all I want!
i wouldn’t trust you or shane with a child
We need an update! Hope you guys got the house! xo
what area of colorado is this house at?  i am a travel nurse and would love to stay in the barn during my assignment.
that house has good vibes
I truly feel like you guys would be so happy here... away from the toxicity of LA. You can of course still visit and whatnot but to have a stable beautiful home in Colorado would be so beneficial to both of you I feel. I could tell how at peace Shane felt just being there and getting the chance at a new beginning. Plus you'll be close to family and especially Morgan because I love when you guys are together. I hope y'all bought this home because I was excited FOR YOU and I'd love to see what content it inspires from both you and Shane :)
Hope you guys get the house! My dream house too. I’m thinking of leaving California too and to Colorado. It’s beautiful there and cheaper. Hmm maybe next year after my baby is born. Cheers to new beginnings
“ at least I’m a Democrat “ I love that 😭😭
Colorado is a beautiful place, welcome!!
you guys should totally move into that house!!🤍🤍 it’s so beautiful and you both seem really happy there!
God it’s good to hear Shane’s voice.
Morgan: Oh my god, a basement with easy access! Me, a gay male: And I oop 💀
Didnt I say not to show me crap videos in my feed anymore? I swear I need a better system them “do not show videos from this channel” or are you two just that needy for attention you need more than one channel to push yourselves off in
Wtf…. How you just gonna do that
Thats def a WEDDING LAWN!!!!!!!
I absolutely love this entire family, I am up for adoption if y’all are interested in adding to the family ? I’m 28 hahaha 😂😂
I'd be painting over all that white and grey, but the house design is amazing!
Aaaaa and???
We're all waiting to see if your offer has been accepted. How about an update, guys?
please Shane and Ryland follow your dreams we will be right here behind you supporting you and Shane your mom can move into the barn
Think I will cry if you don’t get your offer accepted as this house is literally made for you both - even all the Nick-nacks as Shane calls them, they’re like the perfect sign. The pig, the office, the lights, the bling door knobs - it’s perfect 😍 x
We still don't want you back shane
I hope they make a series of the simple life. Like I would totally watch that
I’m patiently wait to see if y’all bought this house!
I honestly hope that you do get that house. It has everything you need, you can even air bnb the barn loft or rent out the stable space so you have horses on the land.   Especially after the nonsense of the psycho knocking on your windows in your current house, it just seems more like your house. the LA house feels so empty, it always has. This house actually feels like a home. It has the space you need for the dogs, an office space as well as room to make a home studio without compromising living space...   I honestly really REALLY hope you get this
Omg I need an update! Please tell me you guys got the house!!
Shane should  make more videos I miss his YouTube videos
Awe…. I love this so much!  Sooooo happy seeing Shane so happy!
I want this house!! Lol
Thank y
😕
You should be
It was so cold
I spilt water and I almost cried
They are literally going to become hillbillys ☠️
Can’t wait till the next vlog I’m so excited 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I love the house too😍😍😍
Uhhh sir 💀
Omg…
💕💕💕💕💕
This is the move they need, Shane just sounds like he fits there and the support of the family is amazing. It’s also a beautiful home - it makes me miss Colorado even more
Omg I'm so mad that you just left us with that cliff hanger. That house is beautiful and you both looked so happy there and the fact that you guys are able to picture yourselves there starting your own family is amazing
I truly think you two should move there permanently. I know you guys like LA but I think this would be a great place to kind of start fresh and really grow and expand your family you want
I love how supportive Morgan is
I hope you get it.  so prefect for you guys and animals
Just the questhouse alone  is my dreamhouse!
A ZIPLINE TOO?!?! OMG p.s I love seeing how excited Ryland's dad is too. He did his inspection and he approves! <3 the fish, the sledging hills, the lake, the perfect decor and house layout, just wow!
oh my goodness, if they move to Colorado as well I feel like this is the happy ever after of a Disney movie for the whole family <3 I really hope it all works out for the best but the suspense and concern for Ryland being upset at the end is keeping me on edge.. omg... This video was an emotional rollercoaster! Almost crying of happiness for them (the music really added a lot of emotion to this beautiful video) and then at the end feeling sincere heartache. Gosh! Also so glad to see Shane on videos more recently. What a beautiful family they all are <3
do ittttt do it do it do itttttt
Nooooooo..... please tell me you got the house!!! It's gorgeous 😍
Annnnnn what i bet yall got it
I would 100% move. Shane and ryland both need a fresh start
Yall have got to get that house look how excited the whole family is. Dad is excited to fish an yall all just seem so happy
Shittt I might just move to Colorado myself! Lol I need a house like that away from the city
That house is perfect an Shane u seem so happy there its so peaceful I would jump all over that
Shane we miss ya soooo much please make some more videos i miss watching you
“Llamas”  “Horsies😁” “✨PONIES✨” 😂
“Well ya know it’s brads friend, and if brad says she’s good, then she’s good” “Not sponsored by Brad” 😂😂
I watched this 4 times because it's my dream house! Fingers crossed yall get it!
Confused why Shane needs an office if he’s not gonna post. It just seems like a room they won’t use.
*checks hat* “well at least I’m a democrat” love ur dad
I’m so excited for them to move here I love Colorado
Cook soon again with shane!
Fingers crossed!!! Keep us in the loop you two!! Xo

Im away from my family, so i know being closer is always better. i love being able to see you do fun things with your family. love all of you, you always make me smile and laugh. i really enjoy your videos. Hope this new chapter in your adventure works out smoothly and you do get the house. Can’t wait to see your next video and update.💗 xoxo
Omg please buy and move into this house! It’s gorgeous, the property is amazing. And you both clearly look visibly happy in this setting. I feel like this would be awesome for both of your mental health!! I want to move here myself! Good luck, I hope you all the very best!
I love how the kitchen looks similar to your guys current house lol I think being out of CA will be really good for you guys
When y’all get horses. Hit ya girl up. I would love to be y’all’s horse handler and show ya the ropes on everything. Is what I do all day every day.💜💜hope y’all get it
but stoooop the dinning and kitchen area 👀😍😭
So when’s the move in date? 😂 it’s really beautiful 💕 I hope y’all get it!!
I can help you guys to move... Just get out there!!!
Wow hes moving to colorado now where actually ghetto!
I could just really see them living here. Shane has to adopt a pig tho 😂
What a beautiful property omg
Loving you and Morgan. Been watching the vlogs for a few weeks and think I'm all caught up. Your family is awesome. I live in Loveland Colorado.
The backyard with the pond is totally Dawson’s Creek vibes!! 😍
Very nice u better have a snow blower .
It feels so good to see Shane happy again ❤️
I love this house. I hope you get it .
I miss u Shane!!!❤️
It's been almost forever for Shane to come back on his  conspiracy theories low key hoping that comes back soon on his channel . When it's time its time. Hoping for the best for the both of you
This is a dream house.  I love it
oh to be rich :/
Buy it and if you don’t buy it for any other reason do it for shayne, that’s exactly what he needs to be happy and free c’mon Ryland… you won’t find that in LA
Love the house. Love y’all.
Rylands dad and Shane 🥺 so cute lol
The Washer/Dryer set is a Whirlpool Duet WED95HEDW/WFW95HEDW set. Decent, few years old probably. You don't really get to see the range very well. Looks like a Viking though. They are great.
No! The horse door like Mr. Ed!!! He did it first! B4 st*pid Hannah Montana! Lol!
I love that everyone wants land and animals! I cam from a 10 acre farm and wanted the city! Been here waaay to long! Just put our house up on the market and we are moving to the country too!!! We are driving around for a bit to find the perfect place and then we will have our own lil "farm land!"
Good luck you guys, i would be so happy for you ❤️
Beautiful home. I can't be the only mom that's like um I'd lose my toddler while I pee somewhere in that house. They are so fast and sneaky 🤣🤣. I'd need all the baby gates and such.
I think it’d be really great to get away from all the toxicity in LA. And this hours is stunning. It honestly looks like their LA house in ways.
Shane is in for a wakeup with that postmates, it looks like an area near me and its difficult for any delivery lol
I'm manifesting that house for you guys. You will live there. I already see it. 🖤
IM CRYING❤️❤️❤️ I truly hope you guys move, i am feeling Shanes excitement❤️🤭
Nobody wants to see Shane in these videos. He's canceled.
Tbh I’m so proud of you guys!! Your moving and leaving the drama behind starting new you guys are doing so well! I’m honestly so proud of y’all I hope you get your dream house ❤️
I'm soooo happy for youuuu!!!! congratulations! I just bought a big beautiful house too, closing escrow next week! this is fun!!! Lots of joy in your new dream home...
Ok but I can actually see them having their wedding there stopppp 😭🖤

Honestly the move beautiful house and property I’ve ever seen
Lemme move in with y’all
Please get it.
Shane talking with Ryland's family about the house and how excited they all are to raise their families just made my heart melt. I want so much for you all. I have my fingers crossed! <3
I love how morgan is like we are gunna have matching tractors lol!
If you buy this property please get married here
You guys totally have to live here !! It's fits you two so well and a fresh start is always good !!
i just watched & i literally wanted to cry.  if you guys get lucky to get this house, the memories that would be made would be absolutely amazing & this weirdly made me so, so happy to watch. i always wish you guys nothing but, happiness. i know i’m a fan but, i’ve been watching Shane for so long & this warmed my heart 💛
when shane said I wanna live here you could hear the truth in his voice....I hope you guys get it...congrats on the new beautiful house and land.
I need to find a place like this.  I’d move in a heartbeat. I wonder if it’s in Denver.
This is such a perfect home for you guys!!! I love it!! I hope it all works out!
Omg when is the next video?
Ahhhh what a cliffhanger! Are we neighbors or not! Fingers and toes crossed for you both!
That house was so beautiful!!!!!!! 😻❤️
Y’all want something even bigger for even less move to Kansas JS
“Not sponsored by Brad” 😂😂😂😂
Thanks YouTube. Somehow I discovered Morgan’s vlogs today and binged from her bedroom renovation. So now I’m here and I’m dying to know if you guys are going to get this house!
AND !!?? I need to know please post soon
I think it would be so healthy to move. LA is so toxic and you guys deserve better ❤️
This is the same footage as ur last vid?
It just makes my heart melt the way Shane got so excited!!!
I like hearing real Shane 🥰🥰 I remember his “Shane character” he used to play was pretty much all we got for years, and now that he’s getting back to genuine Shane, it’s comforting 😌
Link to phone holder in car??
Wow that is amazing.
Wow that is amazing.
So glad to see Shane again :)
A happy Shane! Love you both and I hope you move there. L.A. is poison and you deserve to live in a happy place surrounded by people who love you. SHINEY
Why does Shane look so girls and disgusting to me
I hope you guys get it praying that you guys get this lovely house 🤍
Shane seems so much happier in Colorado, not being surrounded by all these influencers and negative people. You can tell that he's so much more comfortable there, im so happy that Shane and Ryland like it, it will be such a great and fresh start for him.
I’m actually so excited for you guys. A fresh start is def needed
Shane could do conspiracy theories in the officeeee🥺
The sneak peak makes it seem like someone overbid. I hope it all works out.
Imagine how happy your dogs would be. That is so much land!! And growing up with your cousins!! Y’all have to move closer even if it’s not this house
I need an agent like that
Aw ryland’s mom at the end this was so precious!
This made my heart so happy! Colorado fills the two of you with so much joy, you can see it on your faces!
anyone else smiling the whole time seeing all the signs this house is meant for them?!😍🥰

Do it do it do it do it do it do it do it!!!!!!!!!

Okay what about Shane’s mom? She’s tossed to the side?
❤❤❤Everyone protect grandma!!! ❤❤❤

It's so beautiful! ! Yes if you both love go for it I think you'll be very happy there !!-♡♡

Moving is something yall may truly need and leaving all the toxicity back in LA
Nooooo don’t get up the house . I thought  house was you’re or Shane dream house
I'm a little late to the party but I love the house can't wait for them to make it their own and imagine the Christmas decorating Ryan would do 💖💖💖 (we hope)
Omg this is so exciting! I absolutely love the house, you guys have to get it 💗
You HAVE to buy this house! I know you’ll regret it so much if you don’t 🥺 especially if it’s less than half the price of your house now omg ?!?!
Tell shane to post videos on his channel or did he quit
I think you guys will be so happy if you move to Colorado. The environment is freeing & completely different from LA. Maybe this will improve Shane’s mental health.
If they don’t get the house
Their realtor is psyched!
So hope you get the house!! It's amazing!
Come to CO!!
The realtor lady could be Ryland's mom's sister!
This house is a dream. This house is like a brand new fresh start for you guys surrounded by people who actually LOVE YOU!!! God I hope yall move 🥺🤍
Please move there
that house is the definition of perfect
WTF happened to Shane?? He worked so hard to lose all that weight tho gain it all back again! Very sad
Omg I’m loving this style of blog. The best part is how happy you sound!
p.s. I am SO HAPPY to see more of you, Shane! <3
So did you get the house or not?????!
if the lighted PEACE sign is not a sign from the universe, I don't know what is!!!  I hope ya'll buy it!
LA is very toxic, I hope you guys move into this beautiful house
You BETTER GET THE HOUSE!!!!! I’m over here screaming at my phone “get the house!! Get the dam house!!!”
OMG THEY GOT THE HOUSE !!!!! You can tell because Ryland looked like he had been crying ! CONGRATS !
I’m excited just seeing you guys excited. This is exciting omg! That house is so beautiful and u can literally do so much with it and never get bored. Ryland could learn more about cooking here maybe even barbecue outside while everyone is floating out on the pool or u could get his dad to cook for you guys. Omg this is so exciting I’m literally just visualizing how amazing this would be and how I really could see you guys extremely happy here and the vlogs would be just so fun! Plus more Ryland Renovations?? Heck yeah!! Also love Shane and I see he’s slowly gettin back to bein on camera and I love seeing it! He’s amazing, ur both amazing, and this is just so heartwarming seeing you guys like this and seeing how Shane is really starting to open back up to the public again, just the baby steps and progress is beautiful. You will both always be my favorite YouTubers forever ❤️ yay!!! Also wedding vlog here frick yes! U could be like say yes to the dress Rylands addition! Obviously wedding won’t be till a bit but I just can’t stop imagining ur lives here!! Ahh! U need this house! 😂❤️
Moving to Colorado would be the best thing for you guys

Hi reland frend my drem home plese
That house is amazing and perfect for you both you should buy it
When Ryan’s dad takes his hat off to check the color and said “at least I’m a democrat” 🤣🤣🤣🤣 DEAD.
The vibe I get from this video is so nice. You need to live there, it'd be such a happy place for you.  You can hear it in Shane's voice, "I wanna live here". Much love, guys.
Loved this one!  I hope the offer is accepted!
Wait.... Shane's never been fishing?!
Yes! You guys have to buy the house in Hidden Sticks with the Peewee Herman cow door!!! 💓
I really hope you both got the place and have a fresh start!!! The place looks absolutely incredible.
Omg I’m obsessed 😍 please get it for all of us hahaha
How did they literally find the country version of their current house?
This house is perfect again like buy it or I’m gonnna buy it
This house is perfect
It’s REALLY NICE to hear Shane get excited about something again ❤️❤️👏🏼👏🏼💕💕
I missed you Shane !!!!!
Shane seemed more excited then ryland lol
“Atleast I’m a democrat,” is a mood
Im so happy to see shane so happy ❤
I love colorado minus the snow
At least I’m Democrat 😂💀
Finally I’ve been waiting for this! Woo
Awwww jus now watching the video an hoping y’all get the family dream home ❤️ I love watching u both an hope Shane comes back to making videos soon! I need a Shane laugh
What about Shane’s mom? 😕
How are property and income taxes compared to California? Because it it's a little better, it's a no brainer, you should move there, it's beautiful!
You guys need to get out of LA. I think it will be the best decision ever!!
You guys need this house for your souls!! ❤❤
Shane lives there lol same taste 🤭
that backyard is great
Ryland and Shane this is meant to be!
Yeah. Their house in l.a. is so ugly.  Maybe it’ll humble Ryland & remind him where he came from if they both decide to move to Colorado
Hearing happiness and excitement in shane voice is everything
What a Beautiful home you guys found. Both of you so excited both of you will be closer to family .
Please adopt me I’m 21 and I’m funny 😄
A million times YESSSS! Do it! ♥️♥️
No pool
This makes me so happy
I thought the real estate agent was Morgan and Roland's mom at first lol no wonder Morgan trusted her right away
I love how Ryland says my princess to Honey :,))
Instead of a horse Shane will have a herd of pigs!! That’s the dream house I’d give an organ or limb for a place like that to enjoy this short life in!!
Wow what a beautiful home
Get some security cams...a fence and some guineahens...Like the ones that chased morgan lol. They are good security.
We need to have our wedding here!
Yall should do it
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nahh, Fuck this bs video we haven’t forgot ! ! !
OMG Buy it!!!!! Ahhhh! 😩 Guys it’s meant to be!
Why am I crying 😭😭😭❤️
You have to buy it! It has Shane and Ryland written all over it!
Take me with you!!!!
This house/ property is literally breath taking! I absolutely love it!
I’m so happy for them
If you don't buy this I'm unsubbing 😂😂
That house is just………. It’s meant to be! I would leave in a HEARTBEAT!!
YES!!!
They’re on CRACK if they don’t buy it!
Coolag with chris huizar
I grew up in LA, maybe I’m just tooting my own horn but I’m normal. Lol. The thing is, the people who move here are kind of the ones that give this city a bad reputation. They try and live up to the “hollywood” version of what they think its like here. Its not really how we all are as a culture. With that being said thats a nice house! You should do it!
Happy days! So happy for you both. Lots of new vlogs to come I hope.
Why did this make me cry?! 🥲🥲🥲 OMG. It's stunning... S-T-U-N-N-I-N-G. If it was me, I'd move there tomorrow!! Totally my aesthetic too! 😍😍😍 It was so lovely to see Shane so genuinely happy and excited. Wow! What a home! ❤️
Christmas trees!!!!!!! Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! PLEASE!
Following !!
I NEED THE NEXT VLOG NOW PLEASE😂
This video made my heart happy ❤️😊 I’m so happy for you guys
Ryland is so blessed to have such a loving supportive family I think for even their mental health would be the best move to get out of super expensive super crowded super full of clout chasers in LA
this house feels like them, the vibes the personality all of it. i can just feel it not even knowing them its just right
Could you imagine just waking up one day and being able to say “hey let’s uproot and buy and nice huge house in a totally different state and start a new life”.
Dear God, please do not move here.
Get this house!!!
“At least I’m a democrat”   Preach!
Get the hell out of LA! I would if I could! You have the opportunity to do it and you 100% should with no second thoughts! I could cry for you guys!
I´m smiling since the begining of this video, I really felt like I was there with you guys, I´m really so happy for you guys, I know the house you buy will be awesome for your future family and also for your extended family. Shane is the sweetest guy and his emotion is contagious, and Ryland, you was almost floating from the amazement of the beauty around, because the property is gorgeous!  Hugs from Sonora, Mexico.
I’m gonna cry FOR you if you don’t get it lol
I haven't seen Shane so authentically happy in a long time.. hugs! This move will be such a treasure for both of your souls!
I absolutely love Mr. and Mrs. Adams I want them more in vlogs (both) They are cute couple and Mr. Adams was so happy in this one, it shows it would be lovely having Ryland and Shane around.
Y’all obviously got it stop playing 🙄
It felt so good seeing Shane laugh and smile 🥺 I miss you guys!
Omg the kitchen looks so much like their kitchen in LA
This home is stunning.
love love love it and that shane is now slowly showing himself more, could we get longer vids? xx
BUY ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
It’ll be the smartest and best thing to do.  Move out of California. Yes. If not this house, another one you’ll love will come along. Do. It.
I thought about Hannah Montana too lol🤣
Beautiful
I am in literal tears. I’m so excited for your journey and I hope you get the house. I love you and Shane so much.
Lmao when the guest house is bigger and nicer than my entire apartment
This is like really amazing honestly i think this really would be a nice change for you guys truly and it’s amazing I just hope the best for you guys truly you deserve so much
What if you guys got the house then got married in your own backyard🤩
Please get this house!
This would be perfect for you two !! Hearing the excitement is everything and seeing shane again is wonderful miss you bunches !
Sign that shit today
that’s my dream house no joke
This is ten times better than their LA home
I hope you guys get the house, it’s a beautiful property and close to your family. It’s everything, best of luck and I can’t wait to see what happens. My fingers and toes will be crossed for you guys. 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
Get that giant red swamp creature back into the murky depths.
Hearing shane so excited is just amazing! This is really a amazing place to raise the family and do lot's of activities together! It is amazing! Wishing you guys all the luck with getting this!
Why am I emotional watching this? This house is perfect
Bitch, I wanna move there! That house is gorgeous!!!
Add a pool and it’s perfect
I love this home
Lol. The kitchen set up there kinda threw me off because it's similar to their current kitchen set up. 😮🤔😂
omgggggg the house is so beautiful 😍 I said is a good move more peaceful around family LA sucks
You ended it at "and?" Uff.. I really hope you get the house. You both will be so happy. 😊
I'm on break watching this and between the music and happiness this vlog made my day ❤️🥰🥰 I hope you guys get this house it'd be amazing
This house is BEAUTIFUL!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I cried with tis video. I really loved the house, and really hope they move to that house. It made me very happy to see all of them very excited. Thanks to Morgan and Ryland i would love to visit Colorado and even live there. I would love to live in a place like that. I'm very excited for the  next video.
It was the bright PEACE sign in the Living Room for Me!! 💓✌🏻
Damn he got fat. Shane that is
I love seeing Shane in videos so much
This made me cry guys it feels so perfect for y’all. Good vibes hope you get it.
This is cute, but how are you going to secure it??
So happy for you guys 💕
honestly if you guys don't buy this house, I will! I think I just fell in love
I love this house! You guys need this house! Your supporters will support and watch you wherever you go!! I loved seeing you both so happy! It’s meant to be!
I miss Shane so much! 🤗♥️🌈✨
I almost cried seeing how happy you 2 were when checking out the house, i hope you both get it ❤️
This house was built for you guys. Take it and don’t look back.
You guys NEED to stop being so hard on yourselves!!!!! I think this would be an amazing experience for both You & Shane to get a fresh start and get out of the stale overpriced California air :() ........... I'm a Cali Girl ( Bay Area ) born and raised and I do love it BUT HONESTLY, if I had the chance to move out and get a fresh start in the actual fresh air I'd so do it!!   AND honestly, Shane sounded so happy .... you both sounded happy ... I know moving is a big decision and there's some anxiety that comes w/ it and you've both built this house and life and friends together BUT I think you and Shane will be happy wherever you plant your feet PLUS Colorado's not that far away and your friends can always come to visit.
This also my dream. The most beautiful house in this world !
Shane didn’t talk bad abt himself. He’s getting better❤️
Please move in that house. Shane would be so so so happy there. It’s like made for him.  I missed him sm:( ❤️😭 this was so him again. Pleaaaaase Ryland move there with him
the laundry room is bigger than my room
It’s an amazing house ❤️ you go boys 💕
I can just imagine the videos here 😭 like it’ll be so beautiful and house tours after moving in.
So so so excited for you guys! Colorado is such a gorgeous state (I would love to go someday, I've only seen pics and videos)! My only question is what about Shane's mom?? What's her reaction to all of this and moving away from her? She's family too, I'm sure she's sad to see you guys go but also very happy for you! I hope she can visit a lot! Anyway, can't wait for the next vlog and moving update!!
That’s a spectacular property
Get itttttt!!! Shane is so happy, omg. I'm happy watching him be happy lol
don’t move here
This video finally gives me OG Ryland Shane vibes. So so happy for them.
I love this amazing house. I think if you could afford both, at least for a little while it would be a great transition to slowly start living your life in Colorado ❤️❤️
That house is everything and more! It’s beautiful
Meanwhile we are about to see a tidal wave of evictions due to Covid. Gotta love america
If you guys don't take that opportunity and get the hell out of LA and move into literally fucking HEAVEN on earth I may never be able to watch you guys again lol honestly, I love all of you guys so much and watching you all brings me so much joy. FUCKING DO IT!!!!! I'm a 40 year old, tattooed, bearded, long haired truck driver. You guys are supported by people you may not even realize you touch. Never forget that,  and go and realize your dreams!!!
I LOVE THIS !!!!
I think you should celebrate the wedding there, this house literally is the perfect house for both of you, and also I believe it will help Shane.
It’s so beautiful like wow
You guys have to buy this house... My boyfriend of 4 years and i have been searching for months now and putting offers down and not getting out offer taken... You guys look so happy and excited about this house. Say goodbye to LA and buy this home ❤ yall deserve it.
That house just looks like a HOME. It’s perfect for a Family,
That house is a "home" it's meant for you to have a family! I pray y'all buy it! It's beyond beautiful it's my dream house !!
Love this for you guys❤
Wow the house is so beautiful
Omg! Can ya'll adopt me like honestly HHAHAHAHA
i need shane and his content
We need to know I love love that house
I feel this is a fresh start for ryland and Shane, California is too stressful for them and I feel they kept feeling like California was a reminder of his huge fall in his career, in order for new beginnings their will be new places. I’m proud of you both, even though I’m irrelevant asf
Lots of peeps moving out of California.
Must buy because of the bling door knobs
Can we take a moment to point out the Scream swing moment? 😂😂😂
The kitchen looks like the SoCal home.
I hope you guys get the house! Seeing vlogs about it would be amazing. Best of luck to you  <3
I say, tell LA goodbye! So much positivity seeing this house!
This house and vlog is even calming me in NYC!☮️❤️🌈
for everything, this is joyous and makes me so happy for them
Ahh I love seeing Shane so vocal
I love that y’all are in my state AND my city🥳🥳
BUY IT!
So happy for y’all. 🤍
What a stunning home wow.  I am with you guys colours finishes all beautiful
Damn, rylands dad is such a gem. No wonder they feel so comfortable around each other 😭♥️
I pray you guys get the house , get married , and have babies. It brings me Joy to see you both happy ! 💜💙💚💛
Why's Morgan always talking over everyone anymore lool she's sooo hyper 🤣
La houses got NOTHING on this! So homey, light, beautiful and I wanna move in myself!
Obsessed! This house tour gave me goosebumps!
you guys deserve some peace from all the drama. In the end family is always there for you.
I will miss Lizzy. Maybe find a way to do the podcast with zoom? Make it a fun way to share your new adventures with someone back in LA?
This house is EVERYTHING! It would be a great fresh new start for the both of you, I’m already imagining all the fun videos you can make there!
I hope they get the winning bid! 😁💯
Omg its so beautiful. 💕💕 wishing you all the best on whatever choice you decide. 💯💕
I would choose that over LA 1,000x's over
Please shane don't ever leave again fuck everybody's opinion please continue to be in the vlogs I missed you man😪
Tell Shane it's time to come back. I'm bored.lol
Not a fan of the house but the grounds are beautiful. We have a family country house we visit every few months and I love spending time outside. I think Shane and Ryland would be happy there.
Morgans face "WE'RE GONNA HAVE MATCHING TRACTORS😁😁😁" The biggest smiles on all yalls faces!! Love it. THIS is yalls HOME!!! SO EXCITED FOR YALL😭😭😭 even the pig on the wall in guest house. The two ROBES in the closet.. are u kidding me.. sign after sign. Lol YALL HAVE TO MOVE! Would love to watch vlogs in this home. Just stunning!!
Don’t just do that tellll me what happened. !!!

Yessss all in.  So happy for y’all 😭😭😭
this is such a dream house SO EXCITED FOR YOU GUYS!!!
I hope they get the house.  But the convo at the end, and his facial expression made me doubt that the offer will get excepted. 🙁
This house is so amazing it’s meant to be! I’m also sad that you’re moving and shane is leaving his mom in LA but also happy you guys will be really happy there
That house is a home. You can see all the love the current owners have put into it ❤️
Come on out to Colorado besties! We will do dinner 💕
Umm... Lizzy better be coming with you. Lol
oh i miss shane's content :(
hope you get it ❤️😁😁. Its literally meant to be
“At least I’m a democrat” 💀💀
Shane is a disgusting human he has done so many horrible things I don’t care if he apologized I will never forgive him
Oh I hope the took your offer that house is perfect in every way ., sending go good vibes 🙏🏻
Omg guys, this house is so perfect, I hope you guys get it 💜
Go for it, what an amazing property, u’d be mad not to! Good luck. xx
I love love love it!! Gives off such calming and serene vibes . Excellent choice guys, it’s breathtakingly beautiful and is so you  both. Blessings and congrats to both , you deserve it and a new chapter of your life🙏🥰❤️❤️❤️
The backyard is really nice, not gonna lie
where is shanes mom?
This is absolutely amazing place, you should buy it for sure! ❤ The next level!
That place is beautiful........you should buy it for sure .......being away for LA......relax ...and yes start a family ....
i love seeing how happy you both look! Seeing Shane put the camera on himself made me so happy to see him get more comfortable again <3
I adore this house
that husky is beautiful
Hey ryland, please when gettin* horses research a bunch and have a proper place for them
Seeing Shane in this video made me so happy !
Rylan and shane, this is so your house. :)  So your styles as well, and you would be so happy there together. I wish you all the best in your future!
If it costs half of what the current place costs I would sell that and get a small apartment to stay in whenever they go back to LA and then move to this one. It's literally like perfect for them
I live in Colorado and its beautiful! We would love fo round guys to be here 😩❤️❤️
Omg you guys have to get this house! As soon as I saw the pond I was like "the perfect wedding venue!" I only wish we had houses like this where I live 😍.
Ok I’m not one to comment on vids but when I seen you two in the house it just seemed so perfect!! This house is meant for you two and all of Shane’s Knick knacks 🤍
The house that keeps on going definitely beautiful imagine the stories behind that family’s home
If they don't move😡
What about Garret and Andrew? You are not friends anymore?
Not being funny, it seems like everyone has turned their backs on you and let you down in LA or just want nothing to do with you anymore </3 so screw them all. Go be happy and live freely, out in Colorado and live your lives to the fullest. Enjoy the nature and start your family and continue with YouTube if you want to (we'll still be watching! We love you all!). This is the universe sceaming this opportunity at you - please dont let it slip. out of grasp. It feels like this is meant to be. This is so perfect, it really is. You couldnt want for more <3 Wishing you both SO much luck and love!
blah blah blah Ryland you talk too much just show us
Can I please live in the prison of your barn 👉🏻👈🏻
13:09 Shenet? (i know i am not the only one seeing that)Im crazy i know
This video made my heart so warm pure excitement for yall❤
I do worry that they don’t understand how much expense and work keeping animals is
So so happy for you guys, seeing you and Shane so happy is everything🥰 wishing you all the best💕
I loved this . I hope you get the house 🤞
It literally looks like shane and rylands house
seeing them so happy with the house is everything. <3
This video makes me so happy that I´ve literally watched it 4 times already.
What’s going to happen to that creepy little podcast you do?
Y'all are adorable. Wishing you both and the family nothing but the best. Good luck. Family is everything and y'all have an amazing one. Can't wait to see what the future holds for you both. Much love from Boston
This house just fits you guys so well  And your animals would be so much happier and Shane really sounded so excited  Think this would be so good for you guys to get out of LA
This is a great house and i think it suits you guys a lot, Morgan’s house suits her too!
Me in fort Collins Colorado 🙏🙏🙏🐷 let me run into Shane so he can sign all my piggy merch 😍🙏🙏🙏
Love that your new house surroundings zen💆‍♀️🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️
I am feeling si nauseaous when Shane entered the house..Focus on one point n move the camera slow..looks like u forgot how to blog too!!
Your vlogs make me happy
That house is gorgeous 😍
What a beautiful home, my son moved to Colorado a few months ago and loves it so much good luck to them both
This is now 181 THOUSAND people's dream home
This move will be so good for Shane and Ryland, definitely time to get out of toxic L.A
Ya better get that cause I'm about to cop
yall better get this house maaaan 😂so i can live there through you guys' vlogs lol
What about Mama Dawson?
This is how I literally want to live.
Is Shane going to put in the effort to learn how to care for horses or is that going to basically land mostly on Rylands shoulders like all the other animals have?
i liked everything except the main bedroom :/
i think its a great idea to move away from all them sick fucks in California!!! All the new content and conspiracies Shane could think of and new inspiration new haunted places!!!!!!!! I so think it would be so much more healthy for all of them!!! California is not a mystical place its pure EVIL!!!!!
I LOVE ITTT😍😍
I am totally here for a Colorado move! Is moving out of LA the YouTuber 2020/21 trend? I think its awesome - I live in Tasmania and I love our "small town" vibes. Who wants to deal with traffic, unobtainable real estate prices and too many dang people anyway!!! I would be so excited for a Colorado move!!!
I think a new start and beginning is what they need. Get out of LA and live somewhere fresh.
I am in love with this house. Yeah it's big and beautiful but what I love the most about is the energy of it. It's peaceful, calming and i can see you guys being so much happier here.
Where are the ppl moving who are selling this house bc huh?? Why would you ever wanna leave lol
These blogs with Shane are getting me through my depression thank you. ❤️
Not them moving away from there problems
It's absolutely perfect. The scenery is so peaceful. So many possibilities!
LA is toxic ! I would never move back ! I can get a heck of a lot more where I am than I ever was in Cali !
LOVE THIS !!! You can put the above barn little apartment on air bnb ! Ryland can be a super host ! I'd totally stay there when I visit the U.S.
i love their current house so much but the colorado house is something else!!!
🥺 Shane should get a pet pig when they move
BUY IT BUY IT BUY ITTTTT
Shane acting like he don't have a million dollar house in LA lol
As much as I am no longer a supporter of Shane, he would be healthier here in Colorado to really think about his life and how to turn a new leaf. So would Ryland.
Is it so hard to hold the camera still?
Shane looks solo Happy, go run away to the country you'll love it !
That house is beautiful and I can’t wait to see y’all decorate & truly make it yours
I think the move is exactly what you guys need, new chapter 🥰👏🏼 this home is just perfect and the signs its meant to be are everywhere in this home 😍👏🏼👌
Okay....brilliant to end the blog with the cliffhanger.....and at the same time....AWFUL!! I'm fully invested on this life changing decision of theirs and NEED to know if they got the house or not!! Will Rylands dad get to fish in the pond? Will Mama Ryland get to sled on the hill!? Will Morgan get to come and babysit ? Will Grandma Ryland remember all this the next day!?  THINGS I NEED TO KNOW!! 😩😫😓
Fingers crossed that you guys get it!!!! I want to see all the diy vlogs and the wedding omggggg
take the house Ryland! move closer to your family!
YALL HAVE TO GET IT AHHH
Go for it!!!! You guys sooo deserve it.. I loved hearing Shane's voice!!!❤❤❤❤👍
I love this house 😍😍
Why is Shane such a weird mfkn person
The dad is legit so precious 💕💕😭😭😭 I’d be his friend hehehe
Make la the winter home and Colorado the summer home. Think temperature control
OMG! That is a beautiful home, inside and out. It seems mire like them than where they are. And Dad us so happy... Amazing,you gotta get it!
It looks so peaceful...u guys deserve it. I miss u Shane & hope you're filled with so much peace & love right now💖💖💖💖
You need to repent..
But y’all just bought a house ???
We need shane back☹️☹️☹️
Ryland I have to say, I like your current house. It's spacious, modern and had wonderful appeal. However, the Colorado home is like, a home base. It is way more cozy, lost of space for you guys to expand your family, it's more intimate which I think is something you need for a family. Love this new house
I love the house!!!!
Anyone else would be okay with Shane if he just went back to doing conspiracy theory videos? He seems to be doing well and who knows maybe he grew from his mistakes 🤷‍♀️ besides with everything has happened with Trish and how shitty of a human she was and is, Shane probably knew that side of her before us.
I think this would be a great place for you both and to be surrounded by family just seals it
Okay I don't know why but this video made me tear up? Hearing the happiness and how excited Shane and Ryland both were hit my heart. The house is gorgeous and I think a move there is what is needed. LA seems very toxic, where as Colorado has family/family vibes. The dogs would LOVE all that room to run around, hello? My gosh... plus it'll give the chance for new content as well; for Ryland and Shane (When and if Shane comes back.) Hell, even Mama Dawson can live in the guest room. Lol, gorgeous house regardless and I hope whatever choice is made makes them happy. I'd move there in a heart beat. <3
I am honestly crying at how perfect this would be for you two.   Hollywood is dead. Go be happy! I hope you get the house 🤞🏼 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
You need to buy that house... it's absolutely perfect and beautiful! The land is gorgeous! 😍
PLEASE tell me they are moving. I will move in too....from Australia...I am fully vaccinated 😂😁
I think a kid would really help morgans mental health
I watched it twice, this house is perfect!!
What about Shane's mom?
The house is a dream!!!!!!! I hope you get it!!!!!!
I'd dump that L.A. House in a hot second for this one!!!! Do it Do it Do it!!!!!!!
Wow the house is gorgeous! I’d love to see them get it. I think a fresh new start would be good for both of them. I love seeing them so happy & excited
GET THE HOUSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you please ask Shane when he’s going to start uploading again because I think we need him. Please tell him because we need some conspiracy videos and him 🤍🤎
I can’t wait to see the next video!!!!!  Super cute house!
I absolutely love the Colorado home 😍❤️
The house is beautiful and everything. But Ryland keeps saying that is better because HE is closer to home/Family and like what about Shane? He is not close to HIS family   BTW im not hating on Ryland im just giving my thoughts
You can always Air B and B your home In LA
Ryland still posting and posting Shane is an example that love doesnt go off others opinions. Shane went through brutal treatment by the internet but yet ryland stood by him and was unashamed of the person he knew grew.
I would have adored to grow up in a home and area like that.  It truly is a perfect house for a family.
Yessss move to that amazing house! Family is everything and I think it would bring so much more happiness for you both xox
This house is litterally my dream house. With the lake!!! Omg !!!!
Buy it !  It’s beautiful!! Colorado is better than Cali
Yes! This is SO Ryland and Shane! And I LOVE Grandma! Omg! ❤️
This made me so emotional. Everyone looked so happy. I really hope it works out 😭
This gives me mary kate and Ashley camp out vibes and would definitely enjoy a full series ⛺
If you don’t snatch up that house your crazy, move guys!
lol
Is anyone like actually jealous, because this house is amazing
Colorado is expensive cost of living, but you actually get what you pay for. California is atrocious comparably.
Omg. There’s skeleton here!  Shane:: I definitely want to live here🤣🤣
Welp, I'm bringing wine, I'll be over asap rotfl, that place is gorg. Total GUCCI!
PLEASE BUY THIS HOUSE!!!  This can be a fresh start for you guys.  I can honestly see that it would make you so much happier. 💯💯
Awww rylands dad is so sweet 🤣🤣 “ and it’s our friend brads referral “ 🤣❤️
For some reason I feel like your red horse statue will thrive here…
Shane: maybe just postmates is harder to get here?? 🤣
Seems like a good place for a fresh start and a free mind. If you don't buy it for yourself buy it for me 😂
I think this move needs to happen I feel like Shane will actually go outside at this house. Everything is a sign all the Knick knacks in the house, the robes etc.
Be crazy not to go for it. You can always move back. Really nothing to lose but all to gain.
Taboozing !!
If I were them, I'd buy that place in a heartbeat. Peaceful and calming compared to LA.
I truly love that Morgan followed Ryan out to LA and now Ryan is following Morgan home to Colorado. This change is going to be so good everyone.
You guys are making ME emotional with this & i don't even know the answer yet. The house is beautiful and you guys are amazing as usual. <3
Shane and rylands mom having that moment on the porch just gives a glimpse of how great their relationship is😭🥺 so wholesome
It's definitely more of an interesting house than their LA one which is really boring compared to this one
No pool tho
buy that house!!!!
I love how happy Shane is. That is the perfect place to get a fresh start. Getting out of LA will do wonders for anyone’s mental state
Watching this for some reason made me incredibly emotional. I don't even know you both, or you family but have such a great love and respect for y'all. I truly feel like this house is one you could make a home. I loved seeing how excited you and Shane were and how openly Shane felt about envisioning his life with you in Colorado. LA is great for work, but it doesn't have to be where you lie your head day in and day out to do so. With Colorado your family is so close, and it just has a more peaceful environment to it. Plus with all the signs like the robes, nick nacks, the pig wall decor, the similar colour palette and decor, it just feels so.... Shane and Ryland. This is such a dream home!! 💗💗
Love you both so much Love the House!! So excited for you two
Why is this person back in my feed? Did we not clean house?
I think that’s just what you guys need ! ❤️
"A basement with easy access" 😂😂 Morgan is me
This house is absolutely perfect for you guys! It really reflects you and Shane! Best of luck on buying it!
Wow
This house seems made for you both, but whatever you decide to do just make sure its right for yall. And I'm so happy to see more of Shane in your videos, he seems so excited and love seeing him smile more.
I'm crying so much this is so pure
I'm so happy for them
this s my dream house. i gt chills just seeing it. it would be so healthy for you and Shane to get out of LA and start fresh.
I love Morgan and Ryland’s dad!
Shane’s reaction made me sob 😭 ❤️
I think moving would be a prefect thing for you guys to do. LA seems like a unhappy place for you guys. You looks so much happier in Colorado
🥺😭❤️❤️❤️ this video is everything. I’m not crying you are
Love this for y’all & Morgan & the families. Leave LA and that drama behind 👋🏻
Incredible! Hope you got the house 🏡 ❤️ It will be life changing in so many good ways. Surrounded by family, wilderness and beauty. Congratulations 🍾
so happy for you guys! I should visit CO soon cuz a lot of my family lives out there!!
This honestly feels more like their home than their actual home now
List your home as an AirBNB or rent it out is that easy
This guy wants to be liked so bad lmao
So awesome for you guys! So happy for you! 💕💕
Okay but whats the address… I need to build this on the sims
I live in Colorado this is LITERALLY my dream home
I need to plan a group chat with my work friends to meet you guys over there for coffee sometime I love you guys so much!😎😍❤
I love you guys so much been watching Shane for 8 years now. Jump into the unknown. ❤️❤️🙏🏻
Their wedding could be there!
So cool. I need th person to come decorate my house.😊
If you guys don't get this house, I'll cry! 😆
I am in love with that house! I'm really glad you put an offer on it because you and Shane and everyone else seemed so happy and i think it would be so perfect for you guys to move. I hope you get the house, like Morgan got hers! Congrats!
Hit me up if you need any food, hike, bar, recommendations lol. moving from cali to here was definitely different but it is beautiful!
Wow. Just wow!! Stunning. Congrats ❤️
Wolfy
I live for Shane's commentary 💋💨
Thank you Ryland for being the light in Shane’s life🤍 Shane, we love you so much and I can’t explain how happy I am to see you get so excited about a possible fresh start. Been around since 2010 and have never stopped supporting you. I hope you both get this house! The memories y’all could make there would be fantastic!
i definitely think they should move they seem so happy in Colorado and shane seems so excited
Lmaooo Morgan’s pregnancy photo 🤣
And did you get the house cause I'm getting a feeling you might not have. 😢
Oh my gosh, I'm literally tearing up right now. You guys would look so at home there, this whole video is just making my heart swell. I really hope it works out for you two and your future family. Love you guys <3
What a beautiful place to raise a family! I wish you both the best! Family is EVERYTHING!
It's lovely, I really think you should go for it!
I want to live there too
Am I the only one who thinks the realtor has a similar voice to their mom? Maybe it's the Colorado accent lol
I love the pure excitement and joy Shane has with you and your family! It's bittersweet to watch the journey you guys have ahead of you!
I selfishly want y’all to move there so bad to be close to Morgan and the family. BUT I also think it would be amazing for peace and mental health. It’s truly beautiful!!
three years ago i had this weird feeling that i knew shane was going to move to colorado lol i guess i do be psychic
I'm only half way through this video but *I SWEAR IF YOU DONT BUY THIS HOUSE 🏠 I WILL BE SOOOOOOO MAD!*
You guys can redo parts of the house and make it look like a million dollars. If you add a fireplace and some benches and a table outside that is ideal so at night time if u guys have a gathering and an outdoor fireplace yall can eat and then sit around the fireplace and have smores so cute! I really hope yall get it <3 Also, Roman Atwood has a pond and his kids swim in it so that's perfect.
Omg that house is amazing. The wedding would be so beautiful there
please please please do it 🤞Shane seemed so happy,
Move! That house has Shanes name written all over it.
If I never saw Shanes again it would still be too soon!
FOR SURE U WOULD NEED GROUNDS KEEPER STABLE WORKER WHO LIVES IN BARN
Omg I am so excited for you guys! It is a beautiful home. I am going to need you guys to be friends with me though because I want to come hang out and ride horses, go zip lining and just have a blast at your new home lol🤷🏼‍♀️… I think it would be such an amazing place for you guys with family close by. Love it❤️
Grandma Is the Best 😂🤍❤️🙌
IM LOVIN' THIS HOUSE! BEST VIDEO BY FAR, SO MUCH LOVE & JOY!! THIS IS THE NEW CHAPTER,,, I SAY DO IT❤️ 💛💗🤍🌻
I find it absolutely adorable that Shane got the most excited about the knickknacks 💚 I'm a horse girl too ryland! Please just be careful with them, they're such great creatures but anything can happen! Live your dreams bitch 😭💚
I WANT THE HOUSE!!! Its so my taste!!
I have goosebumps… y’all would be so happy here
buy it!!!! its soo amazing and its definitely a forever home!
Yes yes yes! So happy for you gives me chills and makes me smile this is perfect!
WAIT WHY ARE TBEY VACK
You look in the mirror and can walk in to panic about what you saw in the mirror lmao
A place of happiness and relaxation.  Love it!
this house is huge has outbuildings, a tonne of land and is half the price of the other... no brainerrr
What about being close to Shane’s family???
Id kill for a house even half thay
I hope yall get that house it seems perfect
I wish I could move into a place like this!
"Our friend Brad's referral" LOL Good job Brad!
The fact that you can hear in shanes voice that he is already so calm there makes me so happy
Me and my boyfriend are having this talk, only it's with Missouri. The thing we're having problems with that I dont think shane and ryland realize is that most of my family is in Missouri and all of his family is here in California. It's a really big thing to leave all your family and move to another state. Just hope they think this through.
Shane still looks like he stinks of poop
so, shane is trying to come back through ryland's channel. lol shameless
I absolutely LOVED hearing the Excitement in yours and Shane's voice!  Pleeeeeeaaasseee! Let them except the Offer !
Ok I may be gayer than all get out but my southern heart got a little sad when Shane said he’d never fished before!
Shane come back
Lol I have a feeling Ryland don’t really want to move here.
That music says it all. Typed with tears from the emotion in your voice. 📖
You're better off without LA, getaway from the toxic people and city. You guys deserve to relax and do what you guys truly want💜💜
I’m beyond happy for them
this house is genuinely so beautiful. if anyone knows where to find pictures of it somewhere so i can have for inspo!!!
Move out of LA. This is a true homey comfortable place. You dont need all the glitz. Get away from it, you'll find more peace of mind. Its a simple life but a great one.
Do you know Suffolk???
Love the house, but lets see the others toooo
ANNNDDDDDDD???
I miss Shane so much 😔 it was so good to see him again, and to be a part of this special time. Thank you for sharing, and best of luck to you both. The house is so dreamy and holds so much potential!
What’s going on with Shane’s mom haven’t seen her in so long
I hope that you are blessed with that beautiful home, I hope you love the rest of your lives, even when it’s hard to love, and I hope to see you bring a beautiful baby into your new home! ❤️
The little wave Shane did in the mirror was SO CUTE ❤️❤️😂😂
The back yard reminds me of the HSM2 golf course
Ryan bb this house is so beautiful!  hope you make it your home ❤️
Im sorry when I saw the office and the couch it made me tear up as I could vision him doing conspiracy vids there😍😍
This new property is absolutely beautiful! I can see you two livng there and being truly happy, and I hope your offer for it has been accepted! Gd thoughts for both of you!
omg wow this house is perfect. i hope you guys buy it!
I hope you all get this house! This is the happiest I've heard Shane's voice since the palette release <3
Not me actually crying of happiness for them 😭
Ryland has 0 personality in here for Shane
Omg the sheer joy in Shane’s voice 💜. Shane you and Ryland have to buy this house for those of us who couldn’t ever dream of having anything close to this. It’s beautiful
Tell Shane I miss him
i can’t even express how happy this video made me!! this house was meant to be found by Ryland & Shane. Same taste, close to family, room to grow. ugh it’s just perfect. hope they get it. love following their lives. been watching Shane since the beginning many years ago ❤️❤️❤️ never stopped!!
tell me why i cried watching this??? i have watched y’all forever & i just pictured your lil babes running around the kitchen/property. you guys have worked so hard for this season of life & it’s so beautiful to watch 😭😭
Get it!!!! It’s so beautiful and perfect for you guys😍
i hope they actually move in this house I feel like they are gonna be so happy and peaceful here
Ryland, rent your old house. Do not sell it! And I hope you get the Colorado house! 🙏🏼
What about Shane’s mom?!?! Maybe she can live in the barn suite!
I would choose the Farmhouse in Colorado any day over living in L.A. Your priorities change as you get older and I think Covid really put life into perspective for a lot of us. I don't think you will ever regret relocating and raising a family in the farmhouse, but I can see future regret if you stay in L.A. Your life will be so much less stressful. Less stress equates to a happier, healthier marriage in the future. Being surrounded by people you love that can help when needed is also very important. Having a place you can escape and create memories is vital for the human soul.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
I say live in Colorado rather than California for sure
This is beautiful!
Honey.. You just made me sub!
Can we talk about how full circle it would be if Shane could get a pig????
Oh my god Shanes mum can move into the  Farmhouse so he doesn’t leave her behind
Shane's ovulating..lol
I love this so much it hurts my heart
I want so bad for you to have this.
I feel like not only do you guys need this house and this move,  but the Internet needs this. We need less L.A. toxicity!
This house is perfect for them! Certain aspects of it remind me of their old house and current house. I vote yes to Colorado!
After Shawn’s Scream swing comment, we need more paranormal/documentaries… hope you get the place
Shane is right... Those are Christmas trees 😍
Ryland is so blessed to have such a great family. They really should live close to them. They're fantastic. L.A. has absolutely nothing on that.
Good luck to both of you! I hope it works out well. You guys are all so much happier near family. Can’t wait to see the next vlog.
Congratulations guys ! I hope your dreams come true
Ummm did you rent the place for the half day or what ? That was the most non rushed viewing ever
If you can afford it you could always have this one and keep your old and then rent one as a holiday home for a longterm lease.
That place looks like HOME 🥺
Cedar closet
How many baths ???
Perfect
Love this house…
I loved when Shane said, maybe the post mates is just harder to get! 🤣😂🤣
Love that house
What about Shane’s family though?
I wish Jenna would start uploading again. I miss her dogs
So freaking pretty!!
I have to agree with the comment section that Shane has grown so much mentally. I’ve been watching for 11 years. The giddiness  is that you both have for this house is effervescent.
What about Theresa you better be bringing her with u
What about Shane’s mom? 😭 Y’all should have her buy a house out there!
That house is so you guys I love it!!! 😍😍😍
Maybe it is time to leave LA
Can I live there too ? 🥺
Here is idea! But the house and make a series about living there for a year! Raising horses, chopping wood, and sledding in the winter. Everyone will watch it!
Fetal alcohol syndrome, I'm guessing - it has to be
You should buy it! It is great to be near family!❤️
I am so excited for you guys. I can see you getting everything you need in that home.
I’m a small creator so if you want to check me out here I am :) I paint and tell juicy drama filled stories of history
I was all happy and like, "yeah. BUY THE HOUSE. Until someone mentioned the podcast. Is this the end of an era?
I think its such a good idea to move closer to family. Even if you guys don't get the exact house you want its so important to get out of toxic environments
Please buy this house…
Please dont get a horse
Drama channels: Shane returned to the internet and it’s a mess    Ryland and Shane: Just trying to get a new home with knick knacks included 😂
What an amazing property. Leave the toxic la life behind. Can I live in the guest barn apartment?
I'm crying 😭😂 I'm so happy for you guys!!!! I know you are going to get it!
*Shane pans to a spruce tree* Look a Christmas tree! Morgan: that's a pine tree Me: 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Shane needs to get rid of that spirit that's been following him to EVERY house before he moves again. Other wise it's only gonna be round 3.
Wow this house is so beautiful 😍
6:10 I thought about the house on Scream movie (1996) too!
Very nice! Appreciate your new release! : )
Imagine the Shane and Ryland backyard wedding at that house 🥺🥺
If you don’t move there I will…
Momma Vickie is the sweetest!!! Grandma Janice is down!!! i hope they really settle down in it, it seems like a nice fresh start and it’s genuinely beautiful
Yes!! Move to this house.
Shane’s mom could totally move into the guest house!!!! I am here for it
All I can think about is how much cheaper their electric bill will be with those base board heaters🤣🤣
Just to hear Shane being excited about this is literally everything...Get the paperwork signed ya'll will sleep  better live better..Happiness 😊
I looove this property!!! i'm inpired by this for my future farm house.
The house is beautiful!
It be good since they don't have to worry about having peace and quiet!
You should totally get it. It’s perfect for you guys! ❤️
Why tf is this in my recommended. Please don't come into my recommended please.
You both need to move here, it is absolutely perfect, I balled when you were walking through the house. LA is so toxic, you guys need to be free and be yourselves. ♥️
No one cares get off the internet
Nice property. Good luck and much success. Have fun
I finished setting up my channel! Wait...channel...subs...subscribe... OH. SUBSCRIBE TO HEN ALENS UNITE to unveil a gallery of weird, experimental art. Featuring some of your favorite TV and Gaming inspirations and my own original, patience breaking pieces.
Trash
I understand that you've put so much energy into the current house Ryland, with the rooms and podcast office and all, but from an outside perspective- I'll personally say that the two of you are too good for LA. LA is evidently layered in shallow beliefs, and maybe noone should stay there throughout their whole life. I'm sure all of us who have observed you for a long time can agree to feel that, the new house would give you so much that you seem to be looking for in life.
And Lizzie?
This house is gorgeous! Holy cow
Looks like a keeper!😻 tickle tickle tickle!
I can't handle the cliffhanger. They need to be against the law lol. Please hurry with the nxt vlog I can't wait xx
I think leaving LA would be good on both of you😃just watching this Vlog and seeing the views mentally relaxs me! I feel like all the calmness can really give inspiration to both you and Shane and allow you to grow spiritually❤️good luck to both of you 🍀
Love it! Good luck!❤️♥️🥰
Does anyone else feel kind of bad for Shane. Like Ryland is going on about being with his family but Shane’s family is in La.
They aren't getting this house
Ryland and Morgan’s Dad is adorable hahah the sledding hills are sending him 😂
this place is SO gorgeous, i want it
please get it. omg it's like a dream house holy ...
Ok am I the only one who thinks they could find a better house? It's cute but if its going to be your "forever" home I would want more.
Lol the freaking wholesome /sad music was making me laugh. Too cheesy but love ya Ryland lol
OMG! Thats a FOREVER house!
This house is so beautiful 😍
it has such good energy
Ryland, this blog make me so happy, warm inside 💖 it  was amazing,  you and Shane deserve this, this is so beautiful and you are growing up, I'm grateful to see your life and your new beginnings, 💖💙❤💗♥💕💖
Now we have censorship in the comment section. Well done YouTube.
Been following Shane and Ryland for a looong time and I could tell that moving away from LA to Colorado would bring so much happiness, being closer to their family  and eventually start their own in such a beautiful house. So excited for their new chapter and I can't wait too see what's next!
bruh people forget so easily, i wont forget.  shane is a creep.
☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Why am I crying
I'm about to Cry,I can Totally see that House as a New Start for Shane an Ryland new House an New Come back for Shane,Loved seeing him in this Vlog, Excited for y'all Twos Future ❤️
I cant even move out of my house... its not fair.
Educated guesses on price tag?
New subscriber from India..
Just adore this home and the land....what a great place!
It looks great, but the maintaining the house, keeping 8th clean and tidy,  HOLY GOD IT'S GONNA BE A PAIN
this feels like an absolute perfect blend of their old and new house and it truly seems meant to be🥺
Put👏in👏that👏offer ❤️
Knick knacks = Shane's sold  Let's go! 👏🏼👏🏼
I just feel like this is right for you!! I had goosebumps watching this 🥺 best of luck, can’t wait to see the next video!!
i wa teary eyed seeing the house.. its so beautiful. something i would want for me and my family.
You have to buy it. It's stunning.
I love the look of windows, but man, you'd have to wear sunscreen all hours the sun is out! lol
I’m sooo happy for you guys! Y’all deserve the best! Seeing this vid was so heart warming. I’m excited to see you guys & of y’all’s adventures in ur new home ❤️
the audacity
If Morgan ends up as their surrogate, I really hope they have triplets and  name them Frank Jr. Jr., Leslie and Chandler.
Shane can't help but exist in the internet huh
It is the best house ever!!!!  I love it for you guys and family!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
tell shane to come back neowwwwww
This made me tear up. Beautiful ❤️
I love this so much. 🤍🤍🤍 please get out of LA!!
Their LA house it’s a dream but THAT house feels like home tbh 🥰
Move there, trust me.
I WAS JUST IN COLORADO AND I DID NOT KNOW YOU TWO WERE THERE
They both immediately seemed so much happier just being in that house away from LA. ❤️
I hope and pray that you all get it. I think it's just what y'all need. It looked perfect for you guys and to start a family. 💯Luv y'all 😜
I’ve been watching Shane for like ever I feel like and I’ve been watching y’all grow together more and more as a family and your love is so genuine and so real. Getting out of LA will be the best thing for y’all I promise! Be close to family that’s what’s important
The house is absolutely gorgeous. Shane's reaction with the hill for slide is giving me life 😂🤣
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Cliffhanger!!!!😡😡😡😫😫😂
OMG BUY THAT HOUSE
The move will be so worth it
I love the Colorado vibes
AND???????
How exciting!
RYLANDS DAD IS THE MOST PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS
My be out of la your out of your mind if you don't move into that gorgeous house
SO EXCITED for you guys on this new adventure !
i can picture the wedding taking place by the lake! <3 what a beautiful home! <3 i pray you guys get what you want and everything works out exactly as you want! u guys deserve it.
I freaking love seeing Shane in videos again !❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ good luck guys !!! The house is beautiful
This house is perfect for them. There was so many signs they should get it. I hope they buy it
It is beyond beautiful there!
This is the Shane & ryland I miss!! Shane come back plz
love ur family's vibes :)))
AND.........that ending makes me sick, we need answers!!
I love the momma and Shane moment 💕💕💕
oh my god, I'm so happy for you guys! <3
this just feels sooo right
Shane will be negotiating the knickknacks into the price of the house
This is the perfect house ❤️
I miss y’all so much. I wish I can be y’all’s friends in real life! Y’all are so full of life.
Omg you did NOT do a cliff hanger to us!!!!!  I NEED to know what happened?!!!!!!!!!!!
You can't get rid of la...you have to keep both.
It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity.
I definitely think they should move
I'm almost crying, it's amazing to see how far you too have both come and I cannot wait to see how you both progress in the future in a new home with heaps of little babies running around 😭🥰🥰
The house is so homey and looks amazing! I hope the best!!! Being near family would be good for both of you and to be in a place that makes you feel happy
Aww congrats ❤️ I missed Shane. I’ve been watching him since he started on YouTube. Because of childhood trauma it is hard for me to laugh and Shane is one of the only people who can actually make me laugh, even to the point of tears sometimes
Everything happens for a reason and I seriously think this house was made for ya'll! I hope ya'll move away from the chaos in L.A. and find serenity in Colorado!
"Another house that is way too big, can you imagine what mowing the lawn is like?  You will need to hire several housekeeping servants""
Ugh! That cliffhanger!! Ryland seemed so somber. 😭🤞
I cant wait a whole week for the next part!! Please don’t make us wait!!!
And Shane’s mom could stay in the guest house!
Im sorry yall gotta buy this now !.. no question
You get so much more out of California. People catching on. Everyone wants away from people.
Love love love.
OMG I JUST GOT TO THE DEER PART!!!! I'm currently in the process of buying my families forever home, (only a little over 2 weeks from closing!!!!) and when we went out into the yard (6.67 acres, there are tons of trees in some of it) we saw a deer!!!! Granted I live in Wisconsin so it's not uncommon but to have one on that property at the moment we were touring it was incredible. This is another sign!!
Buy buy buy!!!!
I hope you two get the house...it is such a lovely house!!!! and you guys seem so happy with it
Why am I crying?!! I cried during Morgnas home tour, now this one! This SCREAMS Shane and Ryland. It also feels SO much more homey than the house in LA! It's stunning.
Love you Shane 💕.  You need to sell your LA home. To much toxic crap there. Bring your mom. She can live in the guest house. Time for a fresh start. You will the snow. No sweating for 3 months lol 😆 For real, I feel your mental state would be better. Too many bridges burnt in LA with all the kiddi pop people. Let them crash and burn. Onto bigger and better things. 🍻 to your wedding in the Fall
BUY IT,NOW!!!!
Wait is the house in evergreen????? Because I live right by there
I have never wanted something more in my life for someone WHO ISN'T ME and I also love you and your family so much I could watch you all day
I love this video...I was smiling with happiness the whole time! I hope you guys get this house!!!
You know it seems Shane feels more comfortable in Colorado just by the way he’s so vocal and “in” the vlogs. Feel like it would be a great fresh start for them.
Oh no you didn't end it like that
I think this would be such a great next chapter for the two of you i know what in the next vlog has already happened but still im sending so many good vibes ❤❤
ew not these privileged YT gays showing off their home.
Stop making videos
OMG I LIVE IN COLORADO
I think the move would be great for you guys!! 🧡
I love this for you guys. I really hope you guys get it! ❤️
We need the next vlog rn
i can really see them building a family in this house, not just in Colorado but in this specific house
Buy it and I'll pay 1k to have a mini vacation in the guest house? Jkjk 🤣
Ryland. Beautiful home. Hope you  and 🦊Shane do this. Shane we miss you. Come back to us!!!!!
I want this house!!! In love
I literally had chills watching this.  This is where you need to be and where your family can grow.  Praying it works out for you guys 🙏🏼
OMG!!!! I hope y’all move there cuz I’m be moving to Denver next year!!!!
and...
why am i crying with them 😭😭 i’m so happy i’m living through them both
19:21 Grandmas face 😂💙 I’m dead. She’s too pure
This is amazing, you’re all amazing 🥺
Did Shane edit this video?  Because the freaking music is perfect!  I can't!
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all year🥲🥲
Shout out to Brad!
Love your videos!!! Stay safe everyone ❤️❤️
I'm praying for y'all.  The home and land is absolutely beautiful. You both seemed genuinely happy yet shocked ..which I'm just so happy for you.  You'd be close to family who love and adore you. I can't wait to see when the next video posts. Anxiously awaiting.
Since y’all might moved their maybe y’all can go to the Stanley Hotel again
am so happy for them i wanna cry !! hope they get the house !! IT'S GORGEOUS !!
I say GO FOR IT!!!  Life is about taking risks and maybe just maybe this may be EXACTLY what you both need!!!  #luvyouguys🥰
The Christmas tree 💀😂 ily Shane
Omg yes 🙌🏾 it’s beautiful 😍
I am here for this next chapter!
L.A is shallow, polluted and culturally overrated, Colorado is such a gorgeous state  & your Colorado vlogs are my favs, I hope you move sis 💅💅🏞️🏞️🏞️
And what Ryland... You can't make me cry from seeing Shane soo freakin happy for 21 minutes and then leave me on such a cliffe hanger
WE WANT SHANE!!!!!
I hope you get the house! It's incredible!
Some get Morgan her damn tractor already!
I am genuinely praying that you guys get this house. It seems so perfect.
Omg. I am in love with this house! I want it! Haha.   But no, seriously. I hope you guys got it. I have a feeling you did, and I can’t wait for the next video! I want it now! 💕
I can’t wait to tour my first homes when I’m ready. I’ve always wanted to have my own place in the world, this made me even more excited!!
I’m so happy for you guys!!! 💓💓💓 BUT I have a question, how is Shane’s mom? Like is she okay? Is she healthy? How was the pandemic for her? I’m genuinely curious
I think that it’s clear that you need it and you need it now
I really hope they get the house
Yes y’all move to Colorado and say ✌️ to L.A! It’s so beautiful in Colorado
Yes!I hope you get it! And I sure hope Shane keeps getting in front of the camera more often! I miss seeing him in videos!
Can we please vote? I vote buy the house!
It's cheaper because Cali. Has a ton of taxes and shit Texas has a hell lot less
looks like the first house
Oh my gosh, I want that house!!’
If you guys move, put trackers on the dogs having so much land will help you know where they are omgggg I’m so exited!!!
omg shane just return to youtube cause i be feeling hella depressed without your videos 💅🏼😌💔
OMG YAAAAY! Beautiful house😁
I can’t imagine how pretty it would be during the winter !!
I'm literally crying on how gorgeous this farmhouse is. It will totally be a very good investment for you and Shane. I can only dream of a house like this.
You guys should deff live there... I love it and also I just seen shane happier then I've seen him in a long time...

Best wishes!!!!!!
This reminds me of the old days Shane seems so happy when his with Ryland Morgan etc. I hope he moves into that house and it will sort of be back to normal but not exactly back to normal but better then they were. 😊❤️
Oh I pray they buy this house!
I would love to get married out in the country ❤️❤️💜💜💜
Let's think.....you can show this home because you bought it....otherwise so many would want this place.  All of us leaving Cali would want this home.  So congratulations!
I love this house for them
I love this house. Super jelly
Lmao this dude Shane is still showing his face?
POV you are a horse girl and hear ✨barn tour✨
Ummm time to look into houses in there 😨

Wow that home is beautiful!!
STUN-NING!!!!!
I hope they invest in this house and do winter in la and summer in Colorado
I love watching you, Shane and Morgan because you’re honestly so real. I could see you all three being my best friends. I think Colorado will be great for you guys and allow Shane to be more himself. I hope you guys get the property and continue to produce genuine content which we all enjoy!
AAAAHHHH I CANT WAIT IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!! It’s perfect and gorgeous and everything good in this world 🤣💖👏🏼
Wait, people are still allowing Shane Dawson to show his awful face? Wow

RYLAND DAD IS INNOCENT AND GRANNY IS PRETTY
ENG PPL HOMES R CUTEST LIKE SHANE IS SO ADORABLE       THIS GAY LIFE IS THE BEST EVER  BEST COUPLE EVER
Hell Airbnb your house in LA, people would kill each other to stay there.
RYLAAAAND!!!! YOUR DAD 😭 "I just want you to be happy" 😭😭😭😭
WHAT A CUTEST HOME IN A LIL HEAVEN AREA  WOW    BETTER THAN OLD HOME SHANE CAN LIVE WITH HIS MOM DAD
BESTIE SHUTUP NOT ALL OF US MOVING BACK AHHH
And what!!!!! Omg I need more! Lol
Seeing Shane feeling more and more comfortable showing his face and talking more just melts my heart. You deserve happiness. Move to that beautiful house give yourself some beautiful memories and just live. ☺️❤️
Are they doing this cause Morgan did?
Oh to afford that 😞 i could never
i think this move is a really good idea the house and surrounding are so calming
omg i can’t wait for the we’re adopting video! that day will make me happy asfff
Oh my god, now I definitely wanna go Colorado again, if I get the chance to meet you guys 😍 ahh me and my friend took our first trip to Denver Colorado, it was the best memories for us, the snow, mountains and how beautiful it was, can’t wait to go back one day, I’ve only seen Shane in videos since 2010 to now, it makes me happy to see him with ryland and his family ❤️ I think ryland is meant to be with Shane, he’s changing Shane for the better, being there for him, god, that’s true love, you can really see in the video    Also was watching Shane’s old video, be careful of the boiler!
I fully support you to move there 🥺🖤
Miss u so much shane so nice to see u both happy x
Full body happy goosebumps. I love this
My thing is I feel like they won’t use the space
That house is GORGEOUS! Please put an offer in! We moved from the city into a similar property and it is the BEST decision we’ve ever made. Life has been so much simpler and beautiful.
I missed you guys so much.
Say goodbye to LA and enjoy your life together!!!
Absolutely beautiful home, guys. So happy for you, it would be like being in heaven. So peaceful
Love the basement
How exciting!
Oh my gosh I love everything about this house. It's exactly what you both beed. I really hope you guys get it.
I can just imagine cooking with rylands in that kitchen
As a Colorado person, please for the love of all that is good- please don’t move here. We don’t want you here.
They need this. L.A is so toxic they need to get out of there!!
I feel like you guys are slowing transitioning to more wholesome content. And I’m totally here for it.
YOUR TELLING ME I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE UPDATE!? I CANT IM TOO EXCITED FOR YALL
I keep coming back to the video from pure excitement! i really really hope you guys got it 😭
I say grab Teresa & all the furbabies and move here! I love all the Colorado vlogs and it just seems like  such an amazing place to start a family surrounded by your loved ones. Seems like more & more influencers are leaving/wanting to leave LA... I've never even been to LA and I'm over it lol.
I like the idea of them being in Colorado bc my sister and niece live near the Adams. But what about Shane’s mom 😭
if you dont get this house ima cry. i would love this house unfortunately i am broke af :)
Why am I crying
Your red horse will match wayyy better in the new house
im literally so proud of them there so successful and how a good life ahead of them and i realy do hope they have a beautiful family like my favorite people to watch and i never miss a video😂🥺
Oh my gosh this is MY dream house its stunning if you guys don't get it I'm gonna be so sad.
i fucking hate the fact that i’ll never be able to live in a house like that, you guys are so lucky <3
I love the name of the street!!  So quaint.   That price it would be an apartment on the east coast!!  Hope they buy,  still listed for sale! :-(
damn! AMAZING!
زیر نویس لطفا چون شادی و نشاط تو صحبت هاتون بود انرژی میداد 💎🤞
As a realtor, I must say this house is fantastic! Turn key and the change is exactly what you need! There’s enough space to bring Shane’s mom if that makes the move easier.
Part of growing up is watching your priorities change. I'm in a similar state of mind where I went from wanting to live/work in LA and be driven solely by my career to now I want to find someone to settle down with and be able to buy a house with someone and start a life with them. If you guys get this house, you and Shane are going to have so many new and exciting memories and experiences. I can't wait to see what's in store.
The amount of happiness in this video is unreal you guys were glowing and seeing how excited and happy that property made the two of you teared me up. You guys deserve this. 🖤
Damn its really interesting to see the millenial version of the Epstein manor being established in real time!
Privileged fucks.With that being said I really miss Shane
The house is gorgeous 😍😍😍 do it more peaceful 💓🙌
Does anyone else feel happier seeing Shane video himself more on this blog, I have missed seeing him smiling and laughing so much 🥺
RACISTS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Came here to dislike babes
i love how supportive and loving rylands dad is
This whole video gave me butterflies and I almost wanted to cry. This is the house they have a family in. It’s perfect. ❤️
I can’t stand it, I need to know NOW!!!!! I keep watching it over and over
I miss Shane’s conspiracy videos 😔😔😔
What an amazing house. You have to move, California is toxic. You guys need a new start.
God, I pray they get this house. I really am praying they get it.  Let it happen lord
I feel like the offer got rejected by that ending.. I hope not though!! I think it would be a great fresh start and that house is beyond amazing! 😍😍
This house is goals! Good 4 u guys! 💓
We put an offer on the house and......... Fuck rylanddd and what!??????  😭 dont cut it right there 💔
You guys have to buy that house
For some reason I got emotional when you first walked towards the house! I think it’s something you guys need!! This is a lot of ppls dreams that you get to live!
Omg i would loooove to live there, that house was a peaceful and calm place and omg 😍
Wait if ya don’t buy this I will sell my soul for this 😭 it’s perfect
One chapter has ended and a new one has begun......
I hope they move 💖💖
Everyone is leaving L.A.  the toxicity must be terrible
If you guys don’t buy this home it would be a crime! It’s fucking perfect 😍
Honestly I dont think it's big enough for them. Idk. Plus I dont think shane would leave LA, workwise. They would probably get bored in colorado.
Trending in the house! 😍
OMG so beautiful  😍😍😍   I Love it
Im telling you if this is not it I don’t know what is
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
im a not gonna talk on their behave, but I feel like they need this, to get away from it all and they seem so happy
Hope y'all got the house!!!!
Is such a beautiful house ! Love it! Congrats guys. ❤️
Ok so that's the perfect house for you and seeing how sad you look at the end makes me think you didn't get it. How could you leave us hanging like that!? I hope you get the house!!! But even if you don't I still hope you move to Colorado because you both look so happy there. The only thing I'm going to miss is the Sip with lizze!! But I still vote for Colorado.
move... get  that house u wil miss LA but u will probabllly grow tot llove the nature and soak in lllife a bit more where its slowed down a bit
Rylands dad ❤️❤️ I felt kinda bad when they laughed at him saying how the Realtor was recommended 🥺🥺 sweet man
Ask about 👻 ghost's.....or do you bring those with you?       Hee hee hee...Lol!
Nah. Stay off youtube.
Y’all give off the same rancid vibes you did a year ago. I see no growth.
I loveeeeeee ittttt😍😍
Chills! I’m currently moving from Orange County, CA to Minnesota! I cannot express how excited I am for you!
that is probably one of the most beautiful houses i've ever seen; and as a 14 year old who can speak from a child pov i would genuinely love to live there
YES That house is so beautiful I am tearing up just thinking of you guys living there and how comfortable the house looks I’m so happy for you guys
Did y'all forget about what this man did 🗿
I'm so excited to see more of you two and your adventures!!!
Omg that house is a dream. I really hope they get it. I feel like it would be so good for them. So much better than LA. Living on a farm myself, I 100% recommend it, it’s amazing!
It's SO RARE to find a finished house that you love where even the paint colors and hardware etc. are all YOUR STYLE. This is meant to be, guys.
I think this is a great place to start a new chapter in your life. It's gorgeous!💗
SHANES BACK!!!!!!! Make conspiracies
That house is literally made for Shane and Ryland, the signs are showing
That was really sweet when Shane called Ryland‘s grandmother… grandma.
Had to stop watching, this triggered motion sickness for me so bad.
That house has so much character!!! I've been dreaming of moving to Colorado for years. Husband even started job hunting there. But the housing prices were INSANE!
Aww good luck beauties! You deserve your happiness so much! xx
Beautiful house! They have the finances to hire a chef to make them meals/dinners to adjust to no Postmates, etc.
Am I the only one crying? Like this is a dream.
Wow this hhouse is beautiful!
This video made me tear up. Want to see you guys happy!!! After moving from a big city to a small town of 200 people, I can tell you being in the country is the best thing you can do for your mental health. Our town is obsessed with piggies and have them everywhere!
How the other half live eh'
Y’all this house omg do it!!!!! It’s so y’all it’s gorgeous fits u both on so many levels
These cliffhangers! Hope y'all get it, that end vibe was hard to read .... we will all be waiting anxiously I'm sure. lol
this is your sign: buy the house
You need to move into this house. I demand it! ❤️
Omg I hope you get the house I love you and Shane so much
Omg that house is amazing,  love the backyard 😍,  you and shane should move out there and buy that house 🏠,  it will probably do you and Shane the world of good to get out of LA. Plus perfect wedding venue too🥰
i loveeeeeeee this :)
y’all NEED that house!!! 😭😭 u guys were so happy walking through it, I think it’s destiny 🖤
I sooooo hope you guys get the house! It’s like it was made for you guys xxx
Omg the good vibes are so thicccc! This would be a great move for you all!
I think leaving LA would be so good for both of you, LA is just so toxic, there's no privacy there this new house seems like somewhere you can both just relax and be happy. As someone who moved from a busy city centre to a house in the country I can promise you that nothing is better for mental health than that. I wish you both all the best!
It's beautiful and a fresh start away from all the drama would be perfect. Never seen Shane so happy and excited.
I absolutely love the house, an you can definitely hear the excitement in Shane's voice about posible moving to this house ❤️ I think a move would definitely do all of you good. An also being closer to the fam Is something I think both of you would definitely love an need
This is his animal crossing house brought to life😌
Please move mom and dad!!! It’s perfect
That house is so beautiful!!!
Omg !! I hope and pray you two get this beautiful farm house .. 🙏♥
I got bubble guts too! 😍
I demand a video of the dogs exploring
"at least i have the democrat"
Oh wow ! Anyways
Am I the only one who thinks this is what Jenna needs as well?
Omg I hate cliffhangers! Please tell me you and Shane got the house!
I cannot begin to explain the warmth my heart was filled with seeing Shane like this. Happy!  Next step in Shane and Ryland's life: FAMILY VLOGGING CHANNEL! I would die for that! There are no big LGBT vlogging channels on Youtube!
Oh man i love that they are all so happy and excited
My mom has a contract with Zillow
Your intro song makes my day

Buy that house now!
Ok is it just me but at 16:24 the little girl sitting on the fence in a white dress and then she's gone?
What a gorgeous house, you guys should buy it. It's beautiful.
I felt the same way you did. I told my bf we’re moving to Colorado. I hope your offer was accepted. What a dream
OMG...Heaven on Earth!!!!
Can’t wait for the next vlog! 🥰🤗
I’m so happy for you guys, you both looked so happy while walking around that property ❤️
Why do they make me think of Cam and Mitch from Modern Family like their vibe
Aw I would sob with happiness if I got to live there..
I wanna see a video of Shane and Ryland get taught to fish by Ryland's Dad
Fingers crossed for you guys!!!! So excited to follow along on your new journey ❤️😊❤️
I literally started crying! This house is so perfect for you two and the vibes are sooo loving and positive 🥰
I can’t handle this kind of cliffhanger! Did you get it!?!?
i absolutely love this idea of you guys moving but i can’t stop thinking about the podcast with Lizzie i need that content in my life too 🥺
Where does Shane’s momma live though? I hope close by too 🥲🥲 so she isn’t left out of the fam bam.
Hope it's not satellite internet 😂
❤❤❤❤❤
Literal DREAM HOME!!!! I felt so much happiness watching this, you both seemed so happy and excited! Love you guys 💖
this house is so beautiful and suit you guys so much more <3 I'm so happy for you guys
Sending new house vibes!!! ♡♡
Omgoodness, do it! I’m jumping with joy for you guys
The barn guest house could be Rylands podcast room!
Morgan & Rylands dad… ugh. I cannot handle his precious self. 🖤
Nice place.  My only question is how much snow does it get in the winter?  :)  That'd be my no-go.  LOL Ry's dad will be out there every weekend catching fish!  HAHAHAHAHA
Honestly, if you get the house, you'll be the luckiest people on the planet. Not only will you be surrounded by loved ones and nature, but you'll get to escape the toxic environment of LA. It's the perfect place to grow old together
Bubble guts 😂😂
Please move to Colorado we love y’all here ❤️
Praying for you all ♥️ I hope you guys get this beautiful home. Rylands dad is just an angel
This house is gorgeous!!! I love seeing Ryland get so excited plus I can totally see some future conspiracy videos in that office 🤞.
Such a beautiful home 🏡 🧡🙌 love it
Heartland just saying
Wow it’s perfect so peaceful guys have matured so much it’s a beautiful story to watch
Rylands Dad, “At least I’m a democrat.” 😂😂😂😂
This would be such a great thing for them! I think everyone just wants them to be happy and obviously they can be happy anywhere, but  moving into this house in Colorado seems like it’s the first step for their future. So happy to see what is in store for you guys!
Shane has changed so much in 1.5 years. Also, Ryland is still as ICONIC
Shane didn’t make any negatuve comments towards himself. Props to you for growing and changing as an individual
This house is a DREAM!!!!
Omg this places is amazing! Buy it guys! Please
I have all the good vibes and goose bumps for this house. I think you all will be so much happier there
They should definitely get it!!!
Buy it please!!! The videos and everything would be so awesome to watch! Have babies and horses and a gram ugh do it for me!!!
Shane seems more happy and open around rylands family/ in Colorado. It looks to be good for him mentally and I love to see it!!   But I swear ryland  if you put us though a 3 part series about this house just for you not you get it….🔪
That’s so pretty and surrounded by so much nature
And..... You're killing me!!! Eroding yak the best,  no matter your decision!! Sending love
You don’t neeed LA. LA needs you and you belong on the farm where you can be creatively free and happy!
Ok im crying! This is your home 100% so many things about this fits for you guys.😭😭😭💕💕💕💕
The end of the video where ryland says “we put an offer on the house and” it didn’t seem too promising
I think it would be healthy for this couple to move. They'll have family and support in their lives, not affected by L.A. living. I'll even admit that sometimes I think negative thoughts and I feel like that's coming from living in L.A. for so long.
I would sell the LA home, you guys look happier with the farm.
Morgan is so cute I love her so much I wish she was my friend irl.
I absolutely love it!!!!
Zzzzzz
taxes  that's why. taxes.
LA sucks I feel like you guys would just thrive here
Being around loved ones is always the best choice.
Congratulations! So happy for you guys!!💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
This house feels like it was literally made for you two!!  I actually had tears in eyes thinking of you moving out of toxic LA!! You'd be so much happier in CO!!!
I love you rlyand but the intro music just isn’t it
Fingers crossed you guys get it! It's soooo cute!
I miss Shane so much  :(
Shane got fat
Aw I love Shane. Glad he’s back around ❤️
I miss Shane’s mom
I love that house I hope yall move there
She said a pond with fish is rare, meanwhile us in southern Colorado are like excuse me? They are normal down here 😂
I’m just curious how will the podcast still go on? Virtually? Love the house babes🧡
Your mental health would be so much better that house is a one of a kind the land and everything
I’ve been here since 2017 and i’m so emotional. watching you guys go from drunk boyfriend videos to random videos ryland made. seeing shane make jokes about never having a future but then meeting ryland and him being his future. seeing them move and joke about getting married. and now it’s almost like the end of a chapter. i’m so emotional and happy for them. supporter then and supporter now.
They house is stunning
I hope they get it! Such a beautiful property
That house is crazy perfect for y’all!! I really can’t wait to see if you buy it!!!!!!
Shane if you upgrade the barn you could have a beauty barn
I’m so so so happy for you guys :)
This is perfect for you guys😍
It would be cool if Morgan had Shane's baby. Hear me out. If the kid grew up and did an Ancestry kit, Ryland would show up as an Uncle. Which would make him Uncle Daddy Ryland.
this is SOUL SOOTHING just looking at<3
Cliffhanger at the end
What does Shane’s mom think about all this
Aw man this is actually my dream house. It’s so perfect.
I could see you guys being so happy here and building your family here. Please don’t be afraid to go for it. As your fans we will support you wherever you go. I just want to see you guys happy and healthy. Please move closer to your family and build a life you can be content with.
I want to move in! This home is beautiful and looks so serene
This is THE ONE!! Do it!! I moved away from LA last year to a more remote area and yes, I miss all the postmate options but the quality of life is just beyond. Dooooo it! DOOOO IT!! I’m so excited for you two!
If they don’t get the house I’m gonna cry 😭
AND WHAT... YOU PUT IN AN OFFER AND WHAT??!!! You did NOT just do that to me!!!! CLIFFHANGERS put me into EMOTIONAL TURMOIL RYLAND... now I'm going to be freaking out and stalking your social media until you answer AND WHAT lol
Is it just me or did you think the realtor was momma Vicky for a second
I don't think they got it, just by the last clip 😔
BUUUY IT!
This house is a DREAM HOUSE! I couldn’t walk away from that if there was even a chance. It’s so perfect!
It’s gonna be a good move
Lol @ “if we get married” and then he catches himself haha!!
We love wholesome kings!! Congrats to y’all of y’all get it!!!
I love dads!!!
This house is STUNNING! I could totally picture the wedding vlog being filmed there and all the winter time sledding and skating videos. It just seems so much more homey feeling. Love it!!
GET THIS HOUSE. GET THIS HOUSE. GET THIS HOUSE. It’s beautiful 😍
Literally holding in tears watching this vlog😭 I honestly think you’ll both be so happy and SO fulfilled in Colorado.I really hope y’all get this house❤️🤞🏼
This house is gorgeous
Oh Ryland you and Shane would be so perfect at that house! It literally brought tears to my eyes - I was so happy to see you BOTH so excited for Colorado and being around your family, the beautiful nature, and that home - *Chef’s kiss*. I was thinking that guest barn suite is perfect for when Shanes mom visits! It’s lovely. I pray pray pray you two get it!
I hope you get the house.. I can see you making so many good memories. 💗
Its so good to see Shane again. My life has felt empty without him.
Whenever I see houses like this it makes me wonder what the old owners moved into that made them want to move from this 😂
I like the video so much that I watched it twice love you guys
i seriously hope you guys move here!!! this is absolutely perfect!!!! that guest barn would be perfect for rylans podcasts
The upstairs guest room of the barn should totally be turned into the new podcast room for sure, with a ryland makeover of course.
So random… but does anyone recognize the song playing right in the beginning?? It’s on the tip of my tongue 😩
Please get Shane a pet pig 🐽 if there’s going to be a horse it’s only fair you’d start with a pig first lmao
😭💜👍
My husband and I moved into our farm two years ago and it was the best decision ever. We spend so much time outside together with the animals and garden! Farm living is a lot of work but it’s amazing!
I love this video so much!
You need this house! Fresh start and BEAUTIFUL home! Great place to start a family! Absolutely PERFECT
Seeing Shane genuinely so happy is great
That house is beautiful 😻 and compared to LA this one has the home vibes
Meow
I need conspiracy theories filmed in that office I stg
Ok shane stop ... just come back we miss you and you'r conspiracy theorys 💔
How are you going to end the video like that? lol like I’m already tearing up!!!
I want Shane back !
Not gonna lie this seems like the perfect house for y’all, just gives good vibes all around and you both look so happy
This made me happy but kinda sad too. I think the podcast would be over and that makes me hella sad
So happy for the two of you❤️❤️
THIS HOUSE IS BETTER THAN YOUR HOUSE IN LA.....THIS IS A HOUSE FOR RETIREMENT.....VERY VERY NICE....
That’s my dream house to a T
You cant leave up hanging like that......
This house is SO your and Shane's forever home. It's comfy, homey, everything a FAMILY could be in this house. Please take it and sell your LA home to someone else.
I’m pregnant so I’m alittle extra emotional but I love this 🥺💜 I’m crying lol. I feel like it would be so good for y’all. Whatever happens I’m always proud of you guys regardless of any decisions you make. I love you guys!
Cleaning and maintaining all of that is something else though. And I know Shane won't be doing it...
Time to get out of LA
I really hope that Ryland and Shane move into this house I think it would be perfect for their mental health and to relax and get out of the city and get away from the worlds most toxic people so they can have a beautiful life together in this house😍😍😍
I miss Shane this makes me so happy 😊
Why did I totally get bubble guts with you?! 🤣😂 I’m glad to know my southern self isn’t the only one who uses this! Genuinely so happy for you! And the nik nacks 😱
All the signs…… I’m shook.
Super excited for you both, this home is beautiful and I truly hope you guys get it!!
imma cry
What about Shane’s family.
I love you guys ❤️
This property is absolutely stunning and is perfect for Ryland and Shane to move forward with the next chapter in their lives... marriage and babies 😍
I hope you out an offer down and I really hope you get it! It’s lovely ❤️
I’m in love with this house
Yeah... get out of LA, it's toxic af.  As you get older and settle down family really is everything.
I have a question. What about Mama Dawson??🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
The house is BEAUTIFUL! Don’t have to change a thing. And I’m 100% sure moving away from a big city would really do good for their souls. Family is always the best when they’re closer as well.
omg do it. I love it I would buy it
People who said in the last vlog “ Ryland is making Shane move away” like bish, Shane is more excited than Ryland! 😂 Love this for them. 🤍
I love this for y’all 😭❤️
I think that moving to Colorado is a fantastic choice and that house, oh my gosh is just stunning!!!! I am happy to see you guys so happy!
From a tiny apartment to studio city to their current house to this. That's such a glow up.
This made my heart so happy… there’s more to life then California and Shane sounds so excited to have an amazing home with so much room and beautiful scenery 💕 I hope you two do it it’ll be amazing for you both
THIS IS ACTUAL HEAVEN!!!!!!!
Omg am I the only one who got “conspiracy theory” vibes from the office? Woowww!! I’m so in love with this house!! 🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️ ps: not sure why I’m crying but I am!! I think it’s because Shane and Ryland deserve this.
This makes me so happy ❤️❤️❤️
Ryland you don't have to justify yourself to anyone. You and Shane do what's best for your souls.  New chapter new energy! Good luck y'all!
I’m calling it they got the house!
OMGosh NO YOU DIDN’T ….. how could you leave us hanging like that 🤨 lol I hope you guys get it!! Time for your next season of life. Plus I hope I ‘run’ into you guys since we’re living in the same area.   Morgan’s ‘matching tractors’ sold me!!! ❤️
So happy for you guys it looks amazing
makes way more sense for them to live here rather than LA
Move move moveeee...omg im not the one buying the house, but why am i so freakin happy & excited 😭
I really hope this plan was talked with Shane because it’s sounds like YOU want to do this and not much of a WE want to this. I understand you want to be closer with your family but understand your partners decisions too.
Yeah this house is perfect. They never leave their house in LA cuz it’s toxic, this would give them space and privacy
I want to cry because this makes my heart happy. I hope you get the house. 😊
That house is stunning and screams good vibes
I am covered in goosebumps…. Nothing beats being close to your family. Especially when you are having babies of your own! And CO is (IMO) way more built for family life than LA. I hope you get it. The smiles on your faces were so genuine and same with the smiles on your families faces. Nothing but the best!
So all I'm saying is I have horses and know how to take care of them...as I have had them pretty much my whole life....so if you need help, I will move in upstairs in the barn. 😂🙂
WE NEED SHANEEEEEE BACKKKK
i LOVE that the sledding hill was Shane’s selling point 😂😂
i'm not crying you are... you all should go for it :)
This is amazing!! I can imagine the beautiful family of yours growing up and expanding right there in Colorado💙
Do it Shane. You deserve a home like this.
I was thinking they could have both houses. They live in Colorado through the year and live in California in the summer and during the year they could Airbnb it. Just a thought.
Now they need to find Shane’s mom a home out there
Cedar closet in master closet.
It made me emotional for you guys that the house is perfect for you guys, and I love that Shane is starting to come out on the vlogs. I really missed him. ❤️
I missed shane. This house is literally Shane and Ryland if they got it that would be amazing
at 9:47 I thought she said "little basement, the bodies are down there". I checked again cause no one laughed and she said "boilers". I need to stop watching too much true crime. Kendall Rae is at fault here! :0
I hope you get it!! This is an amazing house I’m jelly
I know you are canceled but please make more content, I’m willing to give u a second chance.
How happy I am to just hear shanes voice again. Ryland I LOVE your videos but please convince shane to start posting again!! I miss him so much 😭
And? and? annnd? omaygawd!!! Im super excited and happy for both of you. cant wait to see the next video!!!
Just gonna say, as much as I would love for you guys to have horses, please. Please. please. Realize they require alot of work. Don't just get horses cause they look cool. You need to do research, find farriers in the area, vets, ect
This was actually beautiful.. how your family sticks together. Congratulations you've achieved the American Dream.
This house is perfect for you both. I’m so proud of you guys and you deserve this ! I honestly could have cried watching this !
I love seeing how happy everyone is in this vid....I want this for them❤️
I think the dogs would love it. I know they have a lot of space already but this is so much more grass and things to see and smell. With Cheetos little outdoor explore area he would absolutely be in paradise. Plus I need horse content.
This is my dream home and one day I hope I have something like this
that house is just wow
I think getting out of LA will work wonders for Shane. I'm happy for them .
OMG it’s so beautiful!!! 😱 please move here! Y’all need to get away from the toxicity of LA and start a new life. It would be so good for y’all!
I hate how many people are moving to Colorado like it’s trendy. I visited the state for the first time last week on a hiking trip and these beautiful landscapes and wildlife habitats are being destroyed by new housing developments, Walmarts, highways, and storage centers. Its different for Shane, Ryland, and Morgan because they’re moving BACK, but everyone else needs to leave this beautiful state alone. Let it stay wild.
This home made ME feel all warm and fuzzy and at home. Manifesting this into a reality for you guys!!!! You deserve this & I think we all can agree it’s time to move on from California. LA served its purpose, but it’s time for your guys’ next chapter ❤️
please buy morgan a tractor 😂
Omg the Colorado house is so amazing! Perfect for you guys, but the only thing I’m wondering about is the podcast, like is Lizze gonna fly over to Colorado every week😂
Shane please start blogging again
I loved Shane's little wave in the mirror; you can tell he's really happy here. I am happy for you both! Your dreams will come true. Y'all will be farmhouse owners before you know it!
Um can I come rent your barn guesthouse and take care of your horses and gardening? 🙏🏻😂
The ending killed me! I want to know!!
I can already picture Shane returning to YouTube and filming in this house 😭😭🥺🥺🥰🥰❤️❤️ LA is extremely toxic!! This is the perfect place for you , secluded in the country!! This is a new start! Leave the past behind!
Omg!!! The house is beyond perfect!!! Omgsh I'm so happy for you guys 🥰
this house is SO good for the both of you  I can tell you are so much happier in Colorado and there’s no toxic energy there  best wishes with the (hopefully) new house !!🤞💌
Seems like destiny. Buy, sell (pocket all the extra), live a much happier life. xo
Seeing them so happy and excited about the possibility of having a family and a new home makes me hope one day I will be able to buy my own home.
What about Shane’s mom where does she live
I love this… is really cute and like a soft vintage aesthetic. Really love it
Why do I cry through all of these vlogs 😭
Please move!!! It would be so good for y’all’s mental health and the house is beautiful!!!
Can you imagine the peoples house this belonged to and they see this video like 👁️👄👁️
You put in an offer?!?!!? Prayers to you and your family!!!
you guys definitely need this. and ryland i just wanted to appreciate your intro bc i love it
I honestly hope they get it. ❤️
This video made me so so happy!!
I wish to have that house. IT is so beautiful. Love it❤️❤️❤️
Am I the only one who when I first seen the house I immediately thought of how much it looks like their current one and their old house combined. I think that’s a sign
Rich white people problems....
15:15 god Ryland you could've opened the door for everyone 🤣
It's an incredible property. Go with your heart. Space for Shane's mom to live or just visit. Good Luck on whatever journey you both take.🤞
Es very peaceful place... you should do it
Here before Jane Doe comes to bully everyone in the comments section
Screw LA! Get away from that toxic place!
I really hope they can buy it😭😭🖤🖤❤
What about Shane’s mom?
It was so good to see you, Shane!! You have been missed dearly! I can't wait for you to fully come back to YouTube. I love when you and Ryland vlog together. ♥ You both look so happy! I'm so excited for you guys and your new journey! 🥂
This is beautiful!!! Go for it guys... please, for all of us🤣🥰🥰🥰
Youuuuu bitch!! The ennnnd i was about to cryyy then it ended hahaha
Moving environment is really healthy for you. I’ve grown up by the ocean, moved near the mountains now I live in the high desert. The beautiful thing about your journey is you can pick and root them anywhere you want to bloom. ✨🌹 I hope you both find peace in where you decide to plant your roots next.
I know it's non of my business but I really think you guys should move to Colorado asap I know I would if I could ,the house is beautiful everyone's nice think about it
This is great to see. It really looks like it will fit the both of you. Y'all need to be there, the looks like that place makes the both of you very happy. The peaceful and happy look on your faces says that y'all really want and need this place.
I'm so excited for you guys😭😭😭😭🖤
I’ve never been more excited for the next vlog! DONT LEAVE ME ON A CLIFFHANGER LIKE THAT
These videos are everything please dont stop!!
That is a gorgeous house. Literally a dream home!
You guys seriously need to get this house
Change is good!!! Take the plunge
honestly, moving back to Colorado is the best thing. going up and down from LA to Colorado is a lot. you guys def 100% happier even with just the thought of moving. LA is so toxic and moving is the best choice. even for the animals.
Ugh I hope this happens!!!
Sending all good vibes to you and your family Ryland. I love watching you and if this next step  would make you and Shane happy, it would make me extremely happy as your viewer.
Seeing Shane always makes me want to cry because I want so badly for him to just be happy
You guys could Airbnb your barn house!! Or make extra income by throwing weddings there. It’s great. Do it. Fuck LA
I’m with rylands mom lol if you guys don’t buy it you guys can buy it for me 😭😂😂
G YASSBUSDBW AA LOVE IT
You guys don't need LA you need Colorado.
Honestly before the “new” house they are in currently, from what Shane said he wanted a long time ago, I’d say this is exactly more what he probably pictured. Don’t get me wrong, their place in LA is great but it doesn’t scream homey vibes and doesn’t have the more functioning farm style he originally was going for. Again for that area what they ended up with was perfect, but I think maybe this is closer to the end goal. Plus being closer to family if you have any is a big bonus. It might not have as many rooms or cathedral ceilings but it’s still pretty spacious looking and honestly you can’t compare that property to their current one. This is just its own little sanctuary retreat. Seems like a lot of people are leaving LA this year after coming to terms with many things in their lives after the wake of 2020
If you guys don’t put an offer in on this house I’ll be PISSSSED
i sweaaaar i love your dad so much 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️ i read a comment saying that even if it isn't THIS house... i think buying a house in colorado is definitely in your future and you guys are SO much happier there ❤️ i'm in tears. and i agree with the bubble gut. the house is gorgeous and perfect and amazing. and when shane sat down with vicki to talk... i can't 😭❤️
The real estate agent looks like rylands mom lol
The shane office in the basement is where he needs to do his new "return of the shane conspiracy theories" 💀👽🤖🤩
This Brad seems like a good guy. 😂
If u move what happens to the LA home
Y’all just make me so happy you have no idea. Shane waving in the mirror 😭♥️♥️ so cute. I love that house so much! Such calming and happy vibes!!
Soooo....Part 3 is when, again? I LOVE this for you guys and PLEASE leave L.A. Your souls need a restart.
They should seriously think of moving it would be so healthy for them and this place is amazing
Omg I hope you guys buy that house
“Did they build it good?” “Oh yeah, it’s solid” My dad. Always gotta check the construction
I love this 🥺
Can we talk about Shane’s relationship with rylands family ahhhhhh there so cute
I LOVE Shane! I'm so happy he's back!
no, no, no……
Wow gorgeous house! Congratulations you two!!
Move Shane’s mom into the guest house and BOOM. You’ll have everyone ❤️
I don’t know why I’m crying. 😭 K, mission leave California launched.
I like how, they said this is less than half the price of their house. HOW RICH ARE THEY- LMAO
Sending peace and blessings for your next endeavor.
I hope this works out because I think it would be so good! The house is beautiful!
I love this house! It looks so cozy <3
Aw that’s exciting! I’d buy the house if I where you. It’s beautiful, it’s next to your whole family and it’s half the price.
If Shane's mom doesn't live in the barn, can I? I'll help edit.
Ryand you better get the next part of this Vlog up right now, I LITERALLY fell in love with this house with you, i yelled at the screen when it went to black i can't deal with cliffhangers!!!!!!!!!
Seeing Shan Healy makes my soul happy this feels like a new beginning for Shane
How much is this?
I keep watching this vlog multiple times because everyone’s happiness is infectious. The property is stunning. Can’t wait for the answer to the cliff hanger. Love you guys. Miss you Shane. 😍🥰❤️🐾🐾🐾
So great to see you both so happy again! Your soul needs this!!!!
I would sell organs to buy that house!! Its beautiful and peaceful. Tons of space....Fresh air and just away from toxicity. Being near family  is a blessing when they are good family
You 2 must have that house and make it your home! It’s really everything!!
Just love Shane’s mom to the barn house lol
the barn/guest area in there, that's like the perfect work studio/content center.  Film, Vlog....make a set and do fun stage productions.  Perfect house and yard and seasons here to enjoy with the dogs.  Get out of LA as fast as you can.
moving to colorado would be so amazing for shane and ryland. being so close to family and away from all the LA craziness would do wonders for them. i’m rooting for y’all.
I’m SO stoked for you both! Welcome (back) home to Colorado Ryland! What a stunning home. Imho the Colorado house blows your Cali house out of the pond water. 💖
From a native american spirit worker I've never felt a house radiate such warm positivity through a screen
This house is beautiful! I wish I could afford a house like that! One day... I hope you guys buy it!!!
I love you guys and I’m so happy seeing Shane so happy with your family. 💕💕
Ahhhh this cliffhanger! Can’t wait to see what happens! The house is incredible!
Oh my I got so emotional at the end of this vlog, this house is absolutely beautiful ❤️ you an Shane would be so happy her an so would uno an honey they would love running around that garden even jumping in that stunning lake 😍, I'm so glad to hear at the end you put an offer in and fingers crossed 🤞 you get it because after the last 2 or so years you guys deserve happiness and the fact you get to be near your family is beyond amazing an colorado  looks beautiful it really does, I can't wait till next vlog to see if you would of got it or not, oh my god please, I love you both soo much its crazy ❤️😍😘 xoxoxox
Yall better have bought that house.. haha your fans will never forgive you if you didn't! (Only joking, slightly)
This is a DREAM

IF YALL DONT GET THIS HOUSE 😍
I think this is the best house I've ever seen 😍

John Deere needs to sponsor Morgan and the whole family before they pick a different brand lol.
I hope you guys get it🤞🏼
Fingers crossed!!! It is mint!! What a place.
I hope they get it! It looks like such a breath of fresh air!
2:35 we stan Father Adams
They talk about family but what about shanes mother?
I can’t even begin to imagine how much this would be good for Shane’s mental health 🙌
I love this for y’all!! It’s a gorgeous place in a gorgeous state
I legitimately hope you guys move here because the family vlogs are the beesssst
Shane talking to Rylands Dad was so cute “a sledding hill”
Ummm can i just move into the apartment on top the barn?? Its a beautiful place and I think you guys would be so happy there and if you didn't get this place I am sure there is a even better place just waiting for you to call home
I am so happy for you guys.
Okay, so, please buy this house so I can live through your future clogs there because.....that house is amazing.
I can already picture Shane as a ginger cowboy with suede tobacco colored Stetson, matching chaps & boots, saying howdy welcome to the farm!  I hope y'all get the house it's so beautiful. That cliffhanger was so unexpected but this is what buying a house is like, sitting on edge of your seat, to hurry up & wait while simultaneously wondering what have I done?!
They are all moving because they know CA is literally a shit hole. We should all do the same.
Shane just getting so giddy and happy about the Sledding hills😆 this new house will be amazing for the whole family
If those two robes hanging there isn't a sign... i don't know what is ! :cO This is absolutely gorgeous !! <3 <3 <3
i hope ya'll get that house!!!!
DO IT DO IT SHANE & RYLAND!!!
Omg if y'all don't get this house after putting in an offer I am going to cry! I love how happy and excited y'all seem with all of your family around!
I think this would be good for you guys ♥️
You guys will love it there it’s a life changing decision but it will be a worth it!
I really hope they get that house!! Shane seemed so happy just being there.
This house would be sooooo good for Shane’s mental health. And there is enough room for his brother and mom to have an extend stay in the barn
The house is Gorgeous!!!! Hope you guys get it!! So happy to see again Shane!!!❤ Love you Shaland!!!! (Shane + Ryland, lol) 😁
Tears of joy for you both.
DECORATING OUR PANIC ROOM VLOG PLEASE
Move out of LA I live here and I hate it I can’t wait till I’m old enough to leave really LA is just the place if you have companies or need to work for a higher raise but since you guys have YouTube I don’t know if it still pays good but Moving is definitely the move!!!
You guys really need this, I feel, so I really hope you get it.
Im literally so excited for you guys. On the road to complete and utter happiness 🥰
omg this is so much more homie than the la one
What about the podcast!!? Lizze!!!
Why does this read like a hallmark movie
I’m currently looking for a house to start our family in and struggling to save a £8,000 deposit (even copious amounts of overtime doesn’t get us any closer 😂). This is most definitely a house I can only dream of haha, so so beautiful ❤️
Ryland's dad getting so excited about this house makes me tear up :')
I just have a quick question.. What about Shanes mom? This is all perfect for Ryland and his family but Shanes mom is living alone in LA (if i am not mistaken). So I am just curious why is no one mentioning her..
(Not sponsered by Brad) 🤣🤣
i miss shane and whenever hes on camera he like tries covering his face:/ we all miss youuu come backk
The intern are gorgeous, but from outside looks like a random middle class house....
Can I come visit?  I live in kansas. Beautiful Colorado
You guys belong in that house. I've never felt more sure about anything in my life. I can already tell how much happier you both with be there.
This move would be so good for the both of you!! Family is everything, we moved from Oregon where we thought we would be forever to Minnesota ( life is too short to miss out on the most important things in life) I’m dying!! Please don’t leave us hanging on this cliff too long♥️
💜💜💜💜love this family
Ok I got goosebumps watching this. You can hear the pure joy and happiness in your voices. 🥺🥺😍
Wow, what a dream of a home 😍
I can’t tell you how happy it makes me to see more of Shane in your videos! He was very much so missed!
I LOOOVE that Dad said, “At least I’m a democrat!”
Guys the pig sign IS a sign.😂❤️ The house is beautiful and perfect for you❤️
I'm not crying
Im so excited for you guys possibly getting out of LA and more around family! I love you both!! Its a BEAUTIFUL house!!!
Rylands family is awesome! The whole property in Colorado is SO gorgeous!!
This house is absolutely gorgeous!! I hope you all get it and make the move! It will better on you all to make the move. I know how much you love your home in LA but I can also see how much you will love this one. I think being closer to your family when you start your own will be perfect. Now on to the cliffhanger that wasn't nice lol. I'm so happy and proud of you and Shane!! I'm glad Shane is slowing coming back into the world he seems much happier and healthier!!
Hopefully after they purchase the home, we will see a wedding series ❤❤❤
This is literally my dream house
I love this house 🙌💖 it’s crazy how much it doesn’t cost 😮 Mom is so funny sitting with Shane talking about how she wouldn’t be in the way….. lol
this house is so beautiful! you guys should totally move here😭❤️❤️
Y’all are so funny, you need to come to the Deep South! Come to TN!
I’ve noticed a good amount of OG YouTubers have started to finally move out of CA 😂
The house is absolutely beautiful
Good gawd what are the costs just to keep up the grounds at that place😳
This house is so stunning my goodness
This move would be so good for the both of you!! Family is everything, we moved from Oregon where we thought we would be forever to Minnesota ( life is too short to miss out on the most important things in life) I’m dying!! Please don’t leave us hanging on this cliff too long♥️
I can see the Sip new headquarters in the farm house n lizzys new home upstairs! Lol I hope you do get this house!
Me: born and raised in Colorado. Been here 28 years, working in healthcare, living with my boyfriend’s parents in 50k student debt unable to afford a house 😭
I’m not easily impressed but seriously, that house is absolutely so stunning that I literally teared up!!! 🥲❤️
I think this move needs to happen I feel like Shane will actually go outside at this house. Everything is a sign all the Knick knacks in the house, the robes etc.
It is so beautiful, I'm crying 😭😭😭😭
That house is beyond stunning and to see everyone love it so much is a great thing. I think that would be an amazing place for you to raise a family and then like you said, you would have all your family. Hope you guys get it!
I had the biggest smile on my face watching this video, so sweet! I can see you really love that house.
I love this house. So many possibilities..  I definitely can see you guys living there.  .hi Shane. Love seeing your happy face more and more. Love you guys. I'm a big fan of the whole family.
Me looking at 150k homes that are falling apart 🤣
Please dear God do not move to Colorado. I’ve lived here for two decades (born and raised in Colorado) and because of all the recent transplants from Cali and Texas coming in and buying homes in cash, people who already lived here cannot afford or find housing. It’s mainly Uber wealthy celebrities like Shane who are buying up the homes in the mountains and leaving nothing for folks who really need a home. Aspen, Breckinridge, and many other towns are seeing their locals leaving in droves because we can’t find or afford housing. Or we end up homeless which is another huge problem in Colorado
Turn the barn into a house for morgan
The house is beautiful.
I felt so happy for you guys watching this - I think the move is where you need to be. Hope it happens!
He’s always sweaty and disgusting
I am so happy for them. What I would do to just move out of the hood. I pray to God someday I xan get out of here and have little three bedroom home in the country
It looks like your house in Cali!! That island!! Omigod IM LIVING 💖💖💖💖
Beautiful home!
Shane in the country would be a series, and I am here for it 👏🏼💁🏼‍♀️
Legitimately started tearing up watching this. You can really see the peace and happiness in Shane’s face when he was there. Like he was home. I think it would be so good for them. Even if that particular house falls through, this was the confirmation they needed to make a big change. Love it.
Whether they accept your offer or not, I am genuinely excited for both of you and Morgan for new beginnings. Positive vibes that you guys got the house or something even better! The way everyone was so happy made me smile. That house is gorgeous! 🤩💖💖💖
I was planing on moving on my own and now.... I think I have to do it.😂 This video got me so excited!! 🤠🤠
Omg! If you don’t move here I’m going to!!!! Omg, you guys!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Listen shane and ryland if you are not gonna move here I WILL. Jk i am so happy for you guys and this house will be a beautiful next step in your life. Just think of all the beautiful memories that will be made here ❤❤❤
The house is so gorgeous I watched this video twice!!! So happy for you!
I would say the same like grandma, I would buy it if i could. 🥺 It's so peaceful, fresh, idk what to say anymore. It's just beautiful. Gorgeous.
"Less rooms", dude, what do you need so many rooms for? It's more than enough for a big family to live comfortably!
I just got weirdly emotional when they saw the house.  Anyone else?
Please move the best content you make is your family just being themselves, everyones a main character and we all live for it!
This would benefit them both so much
Excitiiing!!!! I really hope you will get it 😭💛
I LOVE THIS HOUSE!!!!!
The house is AMAZING!!!!
Ok so that wasnt nice, hope you put the next vlog  up soon.  You both deserve it.  You seem so much more relaxed in Colorado.
I am in tears. I genuinely wish you guys all the best. This is very wholesome and a big step. I completely understand. Words can't describe how much I love you guys and wish you the best. I am lost for words. <3
This would be such a good change. I think this suits Shane and ryland ALOT more. Even if this isn’t the exact house for them. This is one step closer to pure happiness 🥺
Not the cliffhanger omg these vids are great really!!
That house is beautiful!!!
I really love this house. I would love to be able to move into a home like that!
ahh welcome to Colorado if you move here😁
They have knick-knacks, they have knick-knacks…Shane put a ring on it.
This is a great next step I’m happy for you guys
Hearing and seeing you and Shane happy has me bawling like a baby ❤️🙌🏼 I’m so happy I can’t stand it 💯😍😘😭
Jesus someone get Morgan a tractor lol
Move and put shanes mom in the barn house they have everything they need
This video is so wholesome I'm actually crying 😭
This house is epic! For some reason I hated the idea of you moving away from your LA house. But as soon as I saw this one, it just felt like your home. I can just totally see this being your forever home, where you will get married & start your family. I really hope you get it (although I assume you do, as I wouldn’t have thought you’d bother with a cliffhanger if it was bad news). ❤️
Amazing house buy it!!!!  🏡 ❤️
Do you know that weird feeling a lot of brides have when they try their actual wedding dress? I think I just had that feeling but with a house, for you guys. So happy for you guys.
I think I was able to build a new dream just by watching this video.
You put an offer and.... WHAT !?!!!!
This house is so perfect for both of you and your future family😍
Lol a little crazy how the layout seems to be almost exactly like the LA house downstairs .🙌🏼 love this.
I hope you buy it !
I was thinking why would u want to move from ur place but this place is so nice,  i want to move in there.. 😄
Think this would be a great place to reset and start a fresh, especially for shane. I really hope you guys get it.
lmao gay asf
To see all there faces light up is what I aspire to have when I find my dream home ⭐️💫😍
Such a beautiful house! Yah you can have both house, one in la and 1 in colorado
MAJOR SLIP AND SLIDE PARTY!!!
I am literally crying guys. Idk why I am so happy🤣
Morgan crying after this video bc she chose the wrong house lmao
the fact that i know for a fact they're gonna use a woman as a surrogate and how sad it makes me feel
With the pond I thought she was talking about the frogs names😂
and what?! Don't leave me hangin' like that🥺 Hope you get the house cause both of you seemed really happy💜 I don't know if you noticed but your eyes just lit up the moment you entered the house, it is really meant to be!! Stay happy, stay safe, we love you guys💜💜
I miss shane <3 :(
Oh I hope you make this your new home! Not just a beautiful house and property, but an entirely new journey for you and your families♥️
LA sucks your soul. Just come back to the mountains.
I think yall should move away from the drama in LA. we could get happy Shane back . The new house is absolutely beautiful.  Good luck u guys.
You would be crazy NOT TO permanently take this House . There is nothing  good in LA. Most people are going off grid or moving to an acerage. Do it! Infact people better start learning to live off grid.more.
this is such an ideal place for me! they seem very happy and you can hear it in shane's voice ackkkk
This video made me so happy. PLEASE move to Colorado with your family, y’all seem so much happier there!
Noooo not a cliffhanger 😭
i honestly think this house would be so much better for everyone. 100% do it. also i miss shane, i hope he makes his return to youtube. :)
Sometimes I feel bad that it seems as if they are basically telling Morgan that she is going to be the surrogate as opposed to asking her.
AND????!!!! Ahhhhhh you both need to move away from the city even if it's for a little while
You put in an offer on the house aaaaand now you are moving to Colorado! 😁🤗
When Ryland suddenly starts making several parts to the video cutting right in the most exciting moment. Work, sis 💅
Noooo if you offer was not accepted I’m going to cry 😿 guys I hope you got it it was sounding like you didn’t tho 🙊💗
This house is gorgeous
It's sooo beautiful
Get it !!! Offer more !!!! Just get it  ....
Idk if it’s my monthly cycle or if i’m just so happy but i’m sobbing
Beautiful home! Definitely the right move (no pun intended) to make ! Colorado is gorgeous and that land/home is amazing. Congrats because i know that’s going to be your home
I don’t think they got it cos of rylands tone of voice at the end of the video (just a guess)
The ending 😭  Please please PLEASE tell me you got that house. You can finally have the garden you wanted :(
You guys HAVEEE to get this house, I get such good vibes omg!
Omg that house and that backyard is to DIE for 😍😍😍😍😍
It's perfect!! I'm so happy for you guys
I hope that living in a place outside of LA will bring y’all back down to earth.
so incredibly happy for you, endless love and support! it's an incredibly beautiful home and being close to family is always so important <3
Is shane coming back soon I miss him
At 13:12 the subtitles say shanet instead of Shane and I’m dying 💀
That house is amazing!!! It seems like a perfect place for Ryland and Shane!! LA is so toxic, moving seems like something that would be good for them.
I hope you guys got it!!! I know y’all would be so happy there!  You will realize how much fresh air and nature helps with anxiety and struggles! I’m so happy for y’all!  We need a tv show! Ryland and Shane take Colorado ☺️
Move right now.
Guys, if you're not buying that house, I dont know. It is so gorgeous!!!! My dream house
Your dad’s reaction when Morgan said she’s going to pop out 6 of her own lmaooooo
This place is amazinggggg. They NEED to move here.
I'm sooooo happy for you! This is the most perfect house for you two!
Animal crossing in real life?
Omg please do it I had literal chills the entire time and Shane couldn’t hide it behind the camera
I hope you guys get it!! Sending all the good vibes
I'm so happy for you guys, you deserve some kindness finally 💗
ahhh!!! i miss you shane and now i’m crying for you guys at 4 am. this house is meant for you guys
Loved how Ryland was so serious and Shane was so excited!!! It is meant to be your future children's home :,)))
The deer must be a good sign!
So happy to see Shane! ☀️
You have to get it your mad If you don’t guys it’s beautiful
Can’t wait for Shane to come back to his Chanel at some point o
So happy to see Shane again 😊💕
THE CLIFFHANGER!!!!!
I think it's perfect for you. You should do it, you only live once.
It's so nice to see you guys happy, the house is gorgeous :)
You need to buy this farm house it's amazing
Thise us the most beautiful and cosy home I have ever seen. GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT ♥️♥️♥️
It’s a mixture of Shane’s old house and their new house 😍
YOU HAVE TO MOVE!!!!!! This is everything!! This house is meant to be yours!
Now I wanna move to Colorado ..
THIS IS A DREAM HOUSE :,))))))
I think It would make you more happy than LA.
OMG! Its so beautiful. 😍 they can have the goats, pigs and horses on their barnnn. So happy for them if they buy it! 😊 tho I can't imagine Shane going from barn to barn. Haha. 🤣
Please get your realtors daughter a horse to keep there !!😭😍
Didn’t they move like a year ago? How come they’re moving again
This house seems so perfect for you guys. If this isn’t a sign to start a new chapter of your life then I don’t know what is. There is so much love in this video 😍❤️
I get moving closer to Ryan’s family but what happened to Shane’s mom? Theyre just gonna leave her ?
I pray that they got the house.
please PLEASE I hope you get the house <3
Omg 😍 literally living the dream!! Happy for you guys and fingers crossed 🤞
Move move u two look so happy there and house was made for u two
I would SO be here for all the colorado farm vlogs! Ideas: "teaching shane how to fish" "nature walk on our farm" "who can make the best igloo" "drunk snowball war with my family"
PLEASE get this house, I know you will be so happy! Its beautiful and perfect 🥺🥺🥺
11:22 bellagio fountain vibes
I hope they get it! That’s an amazing house, LA is over rated
PLEASE DECK OUT YOUR BARN AND GET MARRIED IN IT 😭😭😭💖
Go for it guys.💯😃👍💖🏠🇬🇧
And……? Part two better be uploaded tomorrow 😆 jk love the vlogs, hope y’all actually move cause it look so beautiful !
Buy it!!!!!! And invite me to the wedding 🥰😍
Such a stunning home and lot.
All I have to say is wowwwww it's beyond beautiful ❤️
Id move there in a milisecond
They didn't get it. Ryland's leading up to it but he seems so sad
This will be so amazingly perfect for guys!! This move won't have any effect on my life, but Ryland and Shane... I am so invested in you getting this idyllic  house. All blessings from me for you to get this! You guys deserve everything you want!
Buy the house. It’s gonna be worth it and get the hell out of the city and your gonna regret not buying the house
So according to drama channels..this is the new wave right now.. every youtuber got scandal or canceled is gonna move to the farm like a new start over..
I think this house is so YOU guys 🤩 I can so imagine you living there!
Y'all are a tease  lol hurry put next video out please lol
I hope you guys get this house, this is a video but I felt the happiness radiating from it.
I caught their Mums expression. If you moved to Colorado that be her year!
This house is gorgeous! It seems so peaceful.
today is my 5 year anniversary we got married on my family's property in pa that's been in the family 5 generations after work we are headed up there for the weekend it is our tradition to stand where we were married and have our wedding kiss all over again.i would love this for you guys its truly special to have your own wedding at your property plus the party can keep going too i totally recommend doing it, good luck guys!
YAY!!! I can't wait for the next video
I can picture their wedding happening here. It's a lovely property.
If you buy it - you’re going to have a weird humpy animal there. Something the size of a raccoon. -
Could you imagine how much fun Uno and Honey would have in that pond!  That house and land is absolutely beautiful!!! Perfect for raising a family!
AWHHH I LOVE THIS HOUSE FOR YALL! It’s Lowkey similar to the LA crib lol it’s perfect for your fam! Can’t wait to see updated videos on your new home <3
This would be the best decision y'all could make. The house is 100% Ryland and Shane and I can see you both living such a happy a full life there close to family.
I really hope you buy/get that house. It is so gorgeous and perfect. You two deserve all the happiness life has to give. Go start your family! ❤
This house is good for both of you, it will be a fresh new start. Giving that good juju vibes!
Gorgeous!
Dam I missed Shane i really really did. He truly is a good guy with a bad sense off jokes lol
In love with this house you guys should buy it
Idk I feel genuine happiness throughout the video. It feels like I’m part of the family and your journey even though I’m not ksksksksk
Say goodbye to LA you will definitely be Happer for it
I fell like you guys moving is a sign my childhood is almost over and I was crying this whole video
This house seems so perfect for you
Unpopular opinion - I’m so happy to see Shane back 🥺
This is honestly the most beautiful house I've ever seen
So happy this is that fresh start you guys need i think. Wow i absolutely love it. That's a beautiful home guys it actually feels like one to.   Also. We dont have basements here in the upper peninsula of Michigan either. But ive always had one in Pennsylvania so it was a strange thing when we moved here haha.   Edit. I was thinking just like mr adams about fishing that pond lmao.
This is definitely the house! Its so Ryland and Shane even I got emotional when they walked in
Please tell me they got the house! Omg everything about it was so beautiful ✨💕 And the yard omg the pups would be so happy roaming all over exploring. I can imagine it thought being hard to let go of LA but i think this would be good for them 🙏🏼
wow i’m so in love with this house, completely different to my usual style as well! So jealous of you and shane!😍
im so excited for these vlogs now
This whole house and the theme of it, is literally SCREAMING their names! The little knick knacks and the "farmhouse". They're always wanting a farmhouse, and yes, they kind of have one, but it's not as homey, I would say.  I think you should get the house, of course if you really like it and feels like your home. :) I fully support the decision and I think it'll be a lovely change.
I absolutely love this house!!
Y’all need pink tractors
This is soooooooo happy!!!!!!!!!
Cheeto would just love it here 😂😂 in all seriousness that haunted leather couch better stay in LA , I love this for you ryland and Shane! THIS home is LITERALLY you two put together loooooooooooove this!!
Also, Momma Adams conversation with Shane at the end, my heart melted. I can tell how happy and excited everyone is and my heart is throbbing with all the happiness, just the thought of their life here, it's so cute and so beautiful, i cannot wait for what life holds for them ahead 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️ Sending you guys all my love and hugs, this family makes my life better, they make me happy and they have my heart. I am thankful for each and everyone of you. Thankyou for coming into my life and making my heart so full and warm and happy
I hope you put an offer in before showing it on here ahh u did but the ending is going to kill me to know if you got it
I love the house and see you and specially Shane’s excitement. I live for it. I could totally see you live there and be happy ✨❤️
Leaving us hanging 😭 how dare you
This house is the freaking dream. So so happy for y'all. Hope you get it!!!
So many people in this world don't have any roof above their head. You are so lucky to be able to buy those huge mansions.
Omg buy it buy it... There's lot of signs that this is your home guys 😊😊😊Its like a movie set... ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Am gonna manifest this house for you guys 💜 Am in love with this house❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg...when Shane said "what do you think Grandma?" to Nana MacAlister I immediately thought back to when Shane's grandma used to be in his videos and how much he loved her and when she passed away. The people who have been around for years know what I'm talking about....
I think this house in Colorado is so perfect , I really hope you can buy it and be part time here and there :)
Change is as good as a holiday!
Please this house is just perfect for you two!! And the fact that Shane was so happy is just so amazing to soo! This house screens you and this house would be EVERYTHING!!!
I’m with grandma! I would buy it if I could. This is literally mine and my fiancé dream home.
The house is insane!!
Dang that place is bad ass 🔥🔥🔥
Even if u don't move fully ryt now...u should get this house ..but I feel sad for the ppl who had to sell this house ...it's like everybody's forever home ..
OMG YESSSS DO IT LITERALLY IN TEARS I LOVE THIS 💕💕💕
just have 2 houses
They have to had gotten the house. Why would they share to be disappointed and let everyone feel sad? I’m sure they waited a bit to get some sort of result before posting
What issssss the theme tune? 🕺💃
Oh that's my dream house like wow! Totally perfect! 😍😍🏡❤️
Bawl! I’m so happy for you guys! I love it!!!!!
I really do think L.A. is just too toxic. Colorado seems like the right place for them and they truly seem happy. I wish the best for them and hope they get a fresh start.
I got goosebumps looking at this house, Definitely get good vibes from it
"bubble guts" is gonna be my new word for the day. I REALLY REALLY WANT THEM TO GET THAT HOUSE
I’m really sad Shane’s not filming his experience during this time 😅🥲😪
I think a move is what they need. LA is so toxic, everyone knows them, they seem so happy there. It’s very remote, very relaxing, and perfect for starting their family.
I can't wait to see their weeding pictures near the pond😭
Omg i want to move somewhere like this
10:03 Garret got there first
This house is more homey. It’s somewhere you’d automatically find comfort. It feels like a place of love and family. Just saying.
Omg Shane’s mom should stay in the  room in the barn!
i'm so happy for you guys!!! i love you all💝
This looks like a perfect place to detox from the toxic world outside, so peacefull <3 I loooved how enthusiastic everyone sounded!  the whole house fits them perfectly !
Awww they could get married in their own backyard
Crazy how life takes different paths.. The ones you never think you will go! I wish for you two happiness peace and love.. always!
Ryland being selfish again……what about Shane and his family? Did you discuss that?
Bring mama Yaw though! Don’t leave her alone!
😍
Dream life. Amazingly beautiful!  How could you not?
I’m so sad you leaving la I know is not official but this house does look like is made for you both and I know you will leave 😭😭 but you will be happy
Did anyone notice the rug in the office MATCHES Shane's  old conspiracy shirt?!?
Pls get that house
Dont come back
Congratulations on your new home Shane and ryland - I love Morgan and your dads so sweet
You two have found your FOREVER HOME.. CONGRATS.. HOPE YOU BUY IT
Miss u shane
I literally watched over and over again I really love it
i missed hearing shanes voice
This house is sooo stunning wow! Such a homely feeling home 🥰
Whaaaaaattt you cant just cut off at and !!!!
the leather couch is a new era for conspiracy videosss >:)
I feel like this is a such a good home to being a new chapter in life , and tbh every time you guys are in Colorado you all look so much happier, LA has become such a toxic place and I’d say go for it !! Definitely will be happier there !!
I missed Shane! I understand everything that happened, but he really needs to be in more content!
I was about to start crying for them 🥺 that house is absolutely beautiful wow
Congrats! Love you guys. Happy to see Shane is more comfortable in front of the camera,
This video bring me joy
Can shane leave the internet again, please.
i have a feeling this neighborhood has almost no POC
Wow just wow love the house !!!
I got so exited watching this video like i put an offer for this house 😂
Very happy for Shane and Ryland 💕☺️
That place is incredible.
RYLAND AND SHANE!! Buy this house and move away out of LA! This will be better for the both of you! Buyy it ow and btw i need the next video asap
I have never felt emotional watching a house tour! The most perfect welcoming home I’ve ever seen 🥺❤️
Door cut in two is a Dutch door 😉♥️♥️
Omg I hope you guys get this house soooo bad! It’s the dream! The ultimate dream house! If you feel so pulled to it - do it!
🥰
Shane's little wave in the mirror was so cute. The house is beyond perfect. Loved this video so much 💖
18:46 shanes skin looks so good tho
Love this, hope you guys are super happy whatever you do x
I Love this, love moving vlogs and love this family, so happy and gives such a uplifting feel watching with all the family together. Good luck with thw house, I truly hope you get it. Please make moving vlogs if you do 🥰❤️❤️❤️👍
what a LITERAL DREAM!!! 🥰❤️❤️ you both are so blessed i cant wait to watch!
That’s it! The deer is a sign! Shane is so happy :) now just build a home in a spot somewhere there for mama dawson, she’s sooo gonna love to move to Colorado with you guys 💕
The dream
Like yeah, your mum, sister and family live there, but what about Shane's mum ..
Dad: at least I am the democrate 🤣🤣
It's literally perfect. Meant for the 2 of you completely. I hope to God you both get to move there. It's breathtaking.
I think it’s a sign with deer visiting and being this cute barn house and such. I think it’s the house to get. Lots of room in the house but land wise and privacy. The spare house could be to bring Shane’s mom so she’s nearby.
What about shanes mother?
You should move there🐸🌿🌱🌲🪵🦌🐈🦮
It has so much character 💗I love this place
somebody please get morgan her tractor 🚜
RYLANDS DAD THO😩🥺🥺🥺🥺
Baling my eyes out, this is so pretty!! 🥺😭❤️❤️
I honestly think you guys would be way happier living in colorado. You guys deserve to be happy and we all want that for you shane and Ryland :')
you….you could get a pig😳
I feel like you guys should have looked at other places. But good luck.  Also you should visit oregon sometime. Its really beautiful, but it rains a lot.
It’s great to see all this support again in the comments!
House got creepy vibes
I would get the house. Its a cute looking home thats got the vintage new vibes. It’s the perfect house with land around you so you have privacy. More room and land is better and price wise you save!
Id do almost anything for that house lol
This is so pure 🥺💛
the cliffhanger is making me think the house got sold and i reallyy hopoe not..it seems like such a good fit for you guys.
Ew shane
Omg the new house would be so perfect for y'all! I think y'all will be happier there! ❤ And the fact that y'all can have farm animals is so cool!
If the piggy above tge door isn't enough of a sign! Lol that house is EVERYTHING!!!! Im moving to CO asap!! The mountains call to me lol! Eeeeee IM SO EXCITED FOR YALL!!!! 🥳🥰💋
If you don’t buy this, DREAMS ALL ROUND!
Seeing Shane in the vlogs is soooo heartwarming to me 💗
THIS HOUSE SCREAMS SHANE AND RYLAND!!! I REALLY THINK YOU GUYS WOULD BE SO MUCH HAPPIER  IN THIS HOUSE <3<3:`)
Can we have the next vlog please!! I need to know what happens 😂
Yeah ok and what about Shane’s family?
I think this house is meant to be! Do what makes you happy guys xx
Do houses like these come furnished when you buy them? Is the furniture most likely from the previous or current owner ? Sorry I have no idea how these things work.
Please tell me you are moving!
I was shocked u thinking of moving but the house u went to is a dream land house 😍
Wow, what a beautiful house, barn and land. The owners have great taste.
Ryland's Dad and Shane. I just LOVE their bond! It's so genuine.
Congratulations to you both
If they don’t get this house I will cry…. Being so close to rylands family will be so good for them
R&S, just do it. :)  Sell the LA house and get a fab condo/apartment for when you need to be there.
I love it , I love it , I LOVE IT!😍
I'm sorry but I've lived in a small beautiful community. I know because I live in a small town I may make less. We CANNOT compete with people who have disposable incomes moving here. Yes, it's cheap for you with a CA income but local people don't stand a chance. There is no liveable wage when the housing prices you can pay seem low. People moving to small towns not paying their state's taxes and making it nearly IMPOSSIBLE for people to live there is a HUGE problem! You guys are a major part of the problem for locals.
Can I come live there with you? That is absolutely stunning! If you don’t buy it I will literally cry
Fingers crossed for you
You NEED this ❤
GUYSSSS PLEAAASEEE GET ITTTT GET UTT GET ITTTTTTT OMG SO BEAUTIFUL SUCH A DREAM I WOULD BE SAD IF YOU DIDN'T GET IT PLEASE DO GET ITTT LOVE YOU BOTHH🖤🖤🖤🖤
OMG this house is everything!!! What a dream!
You seem so happy there. Buy it. It already seems like your forever home. ❤️
What about Shane’s family I’m sure he doesn’t want to leave them behind cuz u want to be close to urs u should find something in the middle where both family’s can visit if there’s such a thing
I love this house😍 there's so many pros and although LA is where you work you can travel by plane when you need too. Or sell your LA house buy a 1 bedroom apartment for those work days.
Love this video. Not nice to end the video like you did 🤣🤣🤣 I'll be (im)patiently waiting for the next one. Lol
I smiled the whole video
I just love Shane’s relationship with Ryland’s parents and grandma:) you can tell he’s comfortable 🥰
please get this house
For a second I thought the agent lady was their mom lol
10:36 damn... Shane really put on the lbs. Getting boogie2988 vibes. Did you guys adopt a kid secretly or something, cuz that's a proper dad bod. Also - people have already found the address for this house based on the exterior and interior shots. So you can't move there; people will be camped out outside.
That house is STUNNING
Wow!!!! Amazing! Get it!!!!!!!
Dream home just all the animals you can keep thats a dream.
That house is gorgeous!
If I see shane I click on it. Love u shane
Omg!!! You'll be so close to where iam!!!
I’m sooooo happy to see you guys back and happy!!
I love how Shane isn’t just marrying Ryan he’s marrying the family. They love him and he loves them back. I’m so happy for shane. As a subscriber since the beginning I’m so glad to see him completely happy!
You guys should take this house FOR SURE!!!! It screams shane and ryland! And I think honestly yall will be much happier there.
House has been pending offer since 7/13
Oh my god I 🤬ing love this house I wish I could live here I definitely prefer this one over the current house
Ryland’s dad!! “At least I’m the good guy.” Yaaaassss 💙💙💙
I am sure they will get it. It's nice.
damn..  what i dream house!!!
When can I come visit?
I think the closet might be #jeffreestarapproved
The new house looks so perfect for you two!!! Y’all deserve so much happiness and this is clearly where it’s at
that would be such a great house to raise a family in! it doesnt look to hard to babyproof either:)
Um I wanna move there excuse you 😍
U have to get that house
That house is absolutely beautiful!
YAYYYYYYY
Shane yelling "ponies!"  is so cute! Lol.   And I vote ✅  for ya'll to move to Colorado. It's so beautiful!
Dream house
I can't believe you just made me cry then didn't finish the sentence omg 😭 💞💞💞💞
You guys could keep the house in LA and rent it out, so you get to keep it and maybe move back one day
I really hope this video is like a month old and they already got this house :o
I stopped following Shane last year after having followed him since the beginning, despite that it makes me really happy for him seeing how bright his future is, I know how much trauma and heart ache he’s had in his life, and it’s so nice to see him getting a happily ever after 💗
Can I come be your cook and house keeper? ❤ you both. Shane perfect place for you, peace and tranquility. No one to bug you.
So you guys are having a surrogate to have your tiny humans?
“At least I’m a democrat” JSKDKDKFKF ICON?
i love the house and shanes happiness
my literal dream house tbh
7:27 morgan is the funniest hahah love the  house!
Shane asking about Postmates is truly the biggest mood.
Not sponsored by brad 😂😂😂😂 I loved this video
I love the New home. I hope you get it. Nothing is better then being by your family. Good Luck.
The property agent could be sisters to Ryland’s mom 😆
I’m happy for the both of you💜
I just wish you both happiness and contentment in life, surround by people who love you amd whom you love back... ♥️♥️♥️
Omg Shane it is so good to see you in a video again like I’m crying rn you saved me so many times missed you Shane !!!
Omg. The house is breathtaking <3
I am so excited! 🥺
Ohhhh i hope you get it! THIS is where you should live, even if you dont get this house, you have to move closer to your family. It would be so good for you both, specially for Shane, with his depression, you need to move to a more homey area... And have some babys ❤️
But what about Shane's mom ? 🥺 she gonna live in California alone ?
Love the house 😍
That house made me want to move to Colorado
MOVE THERE ASAP OMG
This house is amazing 💕 get your asses out of LA.. and this is the perfect place to do that 😭💕
My actual dream house. Ughhh I dont wanna wait for the next vlog, even I teared up. lbs. Hope you guys get it!
I can see you guys skating on the baby pond with kiddos ⛸
Y’all are living my dream 🥺😘❤️🤩
.... And whaaaaaat?????.....you guys are killing me :)
yeah you've got too move in
This house is fucking gorgeous 😍  I would love to live here, I would die for that house. I can see you guys living your best lives at this place.
I feel like OG you tubers are slowly leaving LA and honestly good for them,  they need an environment where they’re at ease and they need a breather!
I feel like it would give them a fresh start and away from all the los angles influencer drama.
where's shane's mom durin all this...i wanna see his mom come back and interact with rylands family <3
I seriously STAND FOR THIS!! MOVE SHANES MOM TOO AND HAVE BABIES DAMMIT! Ily all 🥰
The house is beautiful. I can you guys raising a family there. It was so good seeing Shane. Miss seeing his videos.
WOWWWW THIS HOUSE IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF DAMMMM
this makes me so happy, like I can feel the joy through the camera 🥺
Ive been craving a country residence for so long. Been living in a tiny apartment for years and i can't wait to buy a house and have a garden space.  I just gotta say I hope you guys got your new dream farm house. It's a wonderful feeling to wake up in the morning and look out at a country veiw of a sunrise and just breathe in fresh air
Omg you guys deserve it all. That house is perfect go for it! Love u guys so much
This house is gorgeous 😍
Grandma is like soooo oblivious she’s stoned huh lol
I love the modern-industrial farmhouse look! This is definitely the sorta vibe I would want for my own future place.
Come to Colorado ☺️ joint the squad 😂
Not the cliffhanger 😭😭😭
Rylands dad is so wholesome omg
Damn..i even got bubble guts …
I am just smiling the entire time!!! I'm getting good vibes with this house <3 it's so pretty😍
Shane’s mom could totally live in that guest spot when they buy this property.
I think you guys should get the house and move out of LA
Shane is still a creep js
Your dad is so sweet
Beautiful house. Shane was so on board, more then I thought he would be.
That house is stunning! It fits you guys so well!!!
If y’all DON’T move there at least for part of the year I will be upset. You can tell you guys are happier in Colorado
but what about shane’s mom?!🥺
GUYS! if you move here, you HAVE to get married on the land ✨
I hope you get it.  You both looked so happy there.
For someone who’s been on YouTube as long as Shane, I’d expect him to be better at filming. I’m getting sick
please buy this home, this house is so beautiful. you will be so much happier in colorado, i can already see the happiness! i am so excited for you guys!!
5 minutes in & Rylands dad saying “ I want you guys to be happy, whatever you do” ❤️
that is literally my dream house. the design of the whole house, trees everywhere, a POND
i say hi :D    you need get house how  ok
Omg I love this🥺 I really hope they get this home !
I just saw your whole future play out in these clips 😭 All my love and good juju your way for whatever is to come 💜💜
*honestly haven’t seen Shane that happy in so long, you guys belong there. I’m proud of how far y’all have come over the years. Sending lots of positive energy + prayers for new adventures!!* 💜 also, I agree with rylands mom - If y’all don’t buy it, get it for her. 😂
There were so many signs that the house was meant to be theirs. The knick knacks, the skeleton, the pig, the robes etc. I hope they got it!
UGH. you have me in all the feels. Love you guys so much! I hope you it works out for you :)
I’m so happy for you guys 🥺😩❤️ hope you get the house 🤞🙏
Cliffhanger of the year!
You guys so sweet love Shane stop hiding your a Hattie the way you are stop hiding your looks
Love the house, if you don't get it my husband and I will lol.
This house is perfect for you two  💜💜💜
Ohh its such a beautiful house... plz do move... i can invision you guys staying there like forever... ❤❤❤
L.A is not it anymore. I think you moving to Colorado will be the making of you both. All LA does is suck people up then spit them out. I know you are confident ryland but Shane and Morgan will benefit greatly by the move. You could live on the moon but as long as you together you will be happy. 👍🏻❤️
Omg I would buy that house
Why you guys do  this to use lol NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT😭😭😂
Seeing other people happy make me heart go pitter patter 💛💛💛
I truly hope you guys get the house! That's what I want to hear in the next vlog! Please! That was beautiful!
What an awesome new adventure, would be amazing for you!!!
Omggggg welcome home❤️ Colorado has truly missed y’all ❤️
So happy for them that house is spectacular!!!! I hope they keep the house in LA though. Ultimately I am soooo stoked for this next chapter
Aww it's beautiful guys! :) Hi Shannnnneeee!
Let's real talk then Shane. Post on your channel.
This house took my breath away and made me cry a little. Just felt like my dream house for some reason .💕
LA is toxic.
As a Colorado person, raised almost all my life. Highly recommend. I also can’t wait for the blogs of teaching Shane how to be a functional non-LA adult. You can fish Shane!!! I believe in you!!!!
So happy for you guys! I hope everything goes through with the house ☺️
I'm really hoping you got the house! That house screams your names!
Ok but you can’t make me wait another week
i can just see all the room makeover videos that ryland can make!!
this house is beautiful!!
Awwe love this 💕
I hope all your dreams come true
How much is monthly maintenance. .. (How much did it cost to get the grounds sell ready?😳)
Buy this house and rent out your house in California, like turn it into an air b&b
Shane!!!!!!!! I’ve really missed you❤️❤️❤️ glad you’re back😍😍😍that house is sooo beautiful 🤩 I say buy it but keep your other home.y’all are smart! Good luck and congratulations ya’ll❤️🙏🏽✝️😇💙 bless y’all and your decision!👋👋👋
Can we talk about how awesome Morgan and Rylands dad is!?!!? He is the dad we all need
The kitchen is almost like the LA house 🏠 weird lol
I love this home and I hope you get it if this is really what you want. And there's room for Shane's mom in the barn apartment.
BUY THE HOUSE.  ITS BEAUTIFUL
I am genuinely excited for you both💕 I can totally see you enjoying every second of life at that amazing property. I felt all the super cozy vibes watching along in this Vlog. No word of a lie you both had me wanting to cry happy tears for you all. I pray this all works out and you guys have your forever home 💕💕💕
RYLAND this house is not right for babies with all the steps. Keep that in mind. Unless you are going to for instance adopt a 4 year old.
If they do move and if Shane comes back to YouTube who going to be his camera man
It's a beautiful house congratulations
You all HAVE to buy this absolute beautiful home!!!!
What about Shane's mom???
“Oh my god this is farmland!!” Laughs in Ohio
This house literally screams Shane&Ryland to me….IT IS GORGEOUS!!!
Ok so I see why you  are moving the house is beautiful  it like you are leaving behind Garret Andrew Lizzie and Shane’s mom like I get it you wanna be closed to rylands fam but like ya know
Do it!!!! Move! You won’t regret it
That is my dream house, my allergies would suck with all the grass, trees and plants but I wouldn’t care it’s gorgeous!
But why am i crying? 😭😭😭
Omg Im legit crying...
That property is amazing 😍😍😍
It will be so good for Shane to get out of the toxic environment of L.A and focus on his future with his family. I will be great for them to have a fresh start surrounded by family.
I hope they leave LA.  Colofornia ruined shane and make ryland jaded
I say bubble guts when I accidentally intake something with lactose or something makes me super gassy and makes my stomach feel questionable..
SHANE RYLAND, make your offer to include the furniture shane likes. 💓💓💓 Awww  this was cute.  (But shitloads of maintenance, those lawns etc. And the snow on those roof windows. Better make sure the ROOF DOESNT LEAK. ) There's a reason this is SELL SEASON. consult a psychic about leaky thingsc/ structural problems :).
if yall don't get that damn house!!!!
Why did I have a lump in my throat by the end of this video? 😭
My husband and I live in Wyoming because of his work. We want to settle in Texas but this is making me reconsider! I love Colorado already anyway ☺️
Beautiful home! I hope you guys get it!
Fuckkkkk Cali!! I say move! This house is so much better and gives off better vibes too.
Ryland and Shane and Morgan all only a state away..... blessed day
When they have a kid when they turn like 18 or something they could literally move into the barn
Omg 🧡
Move to Colorado but rent out your LA House!
This is a very nice house, (I like your current house tho and the pool haha) but if you guys think this will be better for your mental health especially for Shane, then maybe it is best to move out of LA. It is nice to have the family around when you missed them.
I need Shane back online making funny videos and conspiracy  videos cause without him my anxiety and depression is going through the roof he help me smile and be more happy with his video and not think so negative or about what people say cause I just put headphones in and watch his video
This house is GORGEOUS! I hope you guys get it♥️ it fits you two perfectly. This is a dream home to me. I love you two and want you to be the happiest you can be!
Dawson’s creek!
That house is a dream ! How stunning !!!
Stealing your sister’s house moment by one upping her.
I hope you bought it. You might not find this feeling again.  🥰🥰
This house is absolutely gorgeous! OMG I wish I could move into a house this nice. This house screams home!
this is the most amazing house wow 🤩
Ya know I was really enjoying this video until the very end! “We put an offer on the house and….” 😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬 you a**hole! 😂
I am so happy for y’all. Literally shed some tears while watching this. Happiness is all I see for y’all in this house. Good luck! I hope you get it!
THEY NEED TO GET THIS HOUSE
This place is a dream
When I saw the office I thought, “Hey, what’s up you guys?” 😎
PLS move into that house it's beyond beautiful and screams Shane & Ryland. I can literally see Shane making conspiracy videos in that office 🥺🥺💓
WOW gorgeous house gorgeous yard gorgeous barn!! It's so perfect 💯
Does anyone know what the intro song is called?
I want to like this more than once! The house, your reactions. You’re instantly happier! Love this for you guys! Hope you buy it, it’s absolutely stunning 🖤 Sending love and positivity
This ending is 😲😲
“At least I’m a democrat” lol same
Thereasa needs to move into the guest barn!
I'm not crying 😢 lol so nice omg. Perfect for you two ❤
Omg when the part with the skeleton in between the furnace came up i was like me
Yes I totally think you should move back to Colorado! I absolutely love it here and would never leave!(well maybe just for vacation lol)
i wanna watch this so bad but i know im gonna get motion sickness lmao
I need a video of Shane chopping wood that would be everything!!!!
Sooooo beautiful! This definitely gives forever home vibes. Love it so much!
10:01 OH skeleton, brings back shane squad memories.
I’m excited for you guys. I really hope you get this house!!
Awhhh the house really gives a homey vibes. Love it!
Oh my god, yesssss!  Family is everything.  Buy the house
Grandma seems high 24/7, she is my absolute fav!! If she, rock on, if she isn't still love her!!
they should let Shanes mom live in the guest house barn...
Buy it!!!!!!! It's dreamy!!
Don’t leave us like that!!!!!! I need to know!!!! Was it accepted?!? I’m on pins and needles right now!!!
Ryland did not just do that!
Morgan seems so much happier
i missed shane im glad hes back he needs to start posting again ❤️❤️❤️
What have you been using to thicken your hair?!?
I think you should move... forest fires are not going down anytime soon...
Im so happy for u guys like a fresh start 🤍
It's soo cute... but all my lazy butt see that there are ALOT of stairs lol😂
Anyone got the listing link?!,
Tell me they are buying it with all the furniture and such included. It is so them.
I love it, the snow will blow you away!!!! I love CO
I am mid way watching this and totally feel like you need to move out of LA!!
Why did I start crying at the end 😭💗
Buy it so Shane can go on nice walks around the property.
I actually teared up. I think getting away from LA and moving to this little peace of heaven would be such a wonderful fresh start for you guys. As a fan of Shane from the start and you both I want you both to be so happy and live the lives you both deserve!
Well, if Shane’s bowels are Bubbling, there’s your decision. Get to packing! The house and land is truly special!  Congratulations 🍾
Buy it nowwwwww
Omg… can’t wait for the next vlog! So happy for you and Shane. ❤️❤️❤️
Gahhhh the cliff hangerrrrr
Wow beautiful!!!!
Ryland dad make me cry when he say picture a wedding venue here?🥺🥺omg he love Ryland so much 😢n Shane too bc he was so happy if they moved there🙏💖 loved it 💖💖🥰💗
What about Shane's mom?
Oh wow. This is beautiful and so peaceful. A breath of fresh air. 💛
Please buy this house, it’s perfect. And you can rent it out until you’re there full time. I’m fully invested in this 😂🤍
I honestly think this would be amazing for the both of you fresh clean start close to those who love you the most. After my papaw passed away this year I learned to spend as much time as You can with family them. Family is everything. I love you guys
The "PONIES!" got me
That beautiful home has Shane and Ryland written all over it. It’s gorgeous!
I haven’t gotten to the end but I am reallllly hoping you guys bought the house!! It really seems like the place for self peace! From a viewers perspective that’s farrrrr more than a house. Had to hold back a tear or two can’t even lieeee lol
I got say I hope you and Shane get this house because when your dad talk about the wedding venue. I wanted to cry, that place is so beautiful, and I am praying that you guy's get it.
Cant wait to see if they get farm animals like pigs and donkeys. 💖This is my dream house to live in, the barn would be enough for me tho 😍
Did I cry watching this…YES! Do I want you guys to move into that house.. ABSOLUTELY!!
You mark my words you move to the country and Shane will be healthier in every way. Country people have a harder time adapting to the city than city people have adapting to the country. You will both be happier.
Omg I hope they got it they’d be so happy there
I feel like this is what Shane needs to become a better version of himself.... to get away of the toxic environment LA brings
Ryland’s mom is an absolute GEM
If yall make it into a wedding venue...you can hire me to plan and run the weddings and events! Would be such a dream, that location is beautiful!!
The LA house just looked like a house but this house looked like a home. I hope this makes sense lmao
Ok, but why did I get so emotional at the end. Like wow. So much love for you guys. ❤️
Oh my heck it's sooo you guys and the fur baby's would love it
Omg I cannot believe you left me hanging like that at the end! I am coming over! Lol I love that house in Colorado!
It's been a very long time since I've heard shane filled with such genuine happiness and excitement and it nearly made me tear up. 🥺
OMG OMG OMG oh did I say OMG you guys MUST BUY this house.  It’s totally a happy cozy home 🏡
Okay, now I’m dying to see if they got the house!!
This is perfect 😩
I love how their talking about being dads and growing a family when I truly feel so move love for/from them, they both feel like my own dads, I’m so happy seeing them want to move on to the next chapter in their lives, also just gotta say Shane’s commentary throughout the whole video made me tear up because of how excited he was about the house :)
congrats you deserve some peace and quiet.
And whaaaat don’t leave me hanging like that, I’m all for seeing you guys out in Colorado
Make sure you bring the red horse !!
This house screams Ryland and Shane. If y’all chose to move their 100% would support y’all. Y’all deserve the happiness with being near Rylands family. Maybe if they move we can have mama Shane move down too?
Oh my god. I’m so excited for you all. I can’t wait to see Shane fill it with knock knacks PS - Are we sure that this house wasn’t magically created for for Ryland and Shane? It’s just so perfect.
*& WHAT?* 😭 ❤
I hope you guys get that house. I cried thinking of you guys in that home. Getting married there. Having babies there. Getting all sorts of farm animals.
OMG I love this house, I hope you guys get it. It’s so beautiful. One day I hope I can go visit Colorado.
i  feel  like  it  would  be  grate   move   shane  is  down  to  move it  would   be  good  to be  close  to family  :)
I’m sorry Shane and Ryalnd, I love your Cali House but.. THIS IS HOME 🤍
House was absolutely beautiful it’s time to get out of California because that’s going in the toilet and move to beautiful country
Omg I’ve missed Shane so much
Ryland should be a wedding planner!
Shane back once again without addressing ANYTHING! Ugh. Dislike 😅😡😓
This is absolutely a fresh start. A forever home. I can picture you and shane as an old couple sitting by the pond feeding the ducks. 🥲
this house and environment would be so good for Shane, my god,
Please buy this house! It’s perfect. It’s vibes all the way and it suits the two of you perfectly. I got goose bumps for you.
if yall don't move to Colorado i will be so upset that is one nice house but i feel like yall could use the break away from la to get a breather from everything .
I’ve seen Shane move from long beach to LA, it’s gonna be so weird seeing him move that far,  but I think they will thrive in Colorado, I can’t wait to see his family grow❤️
Can you do part 3 TOMORROW? 😂 I NEED TO KNOW
When the guest room above the barn is cuter than my apartment 😬
Thank you for labeling it “main” bedroom.
Ugh the cliff hang 😭 i need to know!  This house is so perfect and i can see you guys being so happy here for so many reasons.
Oh I'm so happy and excited for what's more to come to the both of you and your family. 🥰🥰😍😍
U all r known for living in LA for so long it’s part of u
omg the house is beautiful!!!!!
I’m already excited for you guys and I don’t even know if you’re moving.
That’s definitely modern farmhouse and I love it! 😍😍
Im in love with this home!! please yes
it’s such a beautiful home, it really feels like a home 🥲
Love the house, love the family, love you Shane and ryland 💜
get it girlsss
Loved the video, but the song in the background just gave me Hobby Lobby vibes :)
This is literally my dream house. Wow. The amount of times I said “wow” during this video was insane. I’ll be manifesting this home for you guys!!!!!
I am so happy to see more Shane ❤️ that house is beautiful
You can play like hide and seek in this house and can never be seen again
That definitely isn’t a ✨barn✨ lol 😂 ❤️
That house was so beautiful guys!!! I can totally see y'all living there!! ❤❤
This house is amazing!! So prefect in every way! I hope you guys got it!! 🤞🏼♥️
I'm literally so happy for u guys 😭😭😭😭 the happiness in everyone's eyes was so genuine and it's made me teary eyed 😭
Sad that this is the only way to get my Shane fix 😅😅😅 but ik he will come back when he's good and ready to.
I’m so excited for you guys. I can just imagine your wedding there.
Joey Potter where you at girl?!? 😂
I am so excited for  you and Shane . Wow that was so beautiful 😍❤️❤️😍 keep up with your amazing videos Ryland can’t wait to see the other video.. Shane is a Iconic love you both ❤️😊❤️
Shane being excited about a sledding hill makes my heart melt! 😭🥰
And ......... me i hope: We have a new house omg its so pretty i would do it to if i was them ❤️
I have a gut feeling that this house is so good for them, and that it’s like a fresh start.
I LOVE THIS FOR THE BOTH OF YOU!!!!!!💕💕💕💕💕💕
Would be so perfect.....Morgan could move in and look after it while her place is being renovated AND you guys pack in L.A.! ❤
I lost my shit at Morgan and your dad wearing cowboy hats! 😂
Sometimes your dreams change! You both looked so happy there!!
Ok those robes, the color scheme, the price, it’s meant to be. That’s fate. That’s their “growing old” house. 😭❤️
I’ve lived in several states and Colorado (in my opinion) is by far the best 😉
YOU GOT THE HOUSE
Do what makes you happy even if it means leaving California. All the best for you both 😊
Literally could not be more excited for you all!! I love Shane’s camera work and the smile when he’s talking to mom. 🥰
I could so see the podcast here. For real though I love the house. I hope y’all get it!!
Do this Shane ! I love seeing you happy 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Congratulations….. Yesssssss !!! 💕💕
The home and property is just beautiful. I think it's an amazing next step.
I love that house for you guys 😭
AWE THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
if it were i wont wanna live anywhere near my in laws
Happy for you guys 😊
Its nice seeing shane excited over moving.
Morgan- We’ll have matching tractors! 😂😂
Christmas trees! It’s like the scream swing! 😂😂😂
Shane has made some bad decisions, just like everybody else BUT he has such a kind soul 🥺🤍.
Literally started tearing up for how beautiful this house is and how much they are going to love living there! 😭💕
THAT IS MY DREAM HOME!
California is toxic and overrated. Make the move!
Y’all need this house!! But I fell like Shane’s mom shouldn’t stay behind but should move as well
3rdx watching.... And i have to say this. There was a time i wasn't a big fan of Rylalnd. Like others, i was concerned about his character & possibly taking advantage of Shane. But let me be the first to say, i regret those thoughts in the beginning. Ryland has shown who he really is the past year & so. He has not only stood by Shane and defended him, but Ryland has picked up all the pieces for both and kept it moving, took the reigns and didn't bat an eye. You got to respect that! 💖💯I'm so happy that y'all are excited and happy over something again. Can't wait for the wedding!😁💖🥂
PLEASE MOVE HERE!!! I dk why this whole vlog made me want to cry listening to how excited shane is! They need this!
This gave me the feels so much. This is a gorgeous home and no place better to raise a family, I might be biased as a native Coloradan. This feels like a forever home.
This house is like my dream country house!! ❤️❤️❤️ I love it!
I would love you to move to Colorado but what about the podcast,Shane’s mom ?
Can you copy and paste this house on my property? ♡ this is the LIFETIME MOVIE LIFE I WANT TO LIVE ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Shane saying "horsies" is literally me
it's perfect 🌷🍀
I’m seriously obsessed that house is beautiful it’s like what I envision my house to look like
That house is amazing! Hope you guys get it.
This is annoying.  Just make longer videos. We all want it.
Morgan!!! Is so jelly🤣🤣🤣🤣
at least i have the democrat. ew.
love watching this while living in my car
I couldn't afford the guest house😭😂it's so nice, I'm in love
Oh my gosh! I am sooooo happy for you both. LA and California as a whole has just gotten way too toxic. You guys should be where you are the happiest and I know that your family (Ryland) loves Shane and accepts him so much and you guys will be so happy in Colorado. I am so excited to see what the future holds for you guys because it's going to be so wonderful! 💜💜💜💜💜💜
Do whatever make yall BOTH happy! I love that house tho!
This is my dream house! If I could afford something like this I would get it in a  heart beat.
This house has warm, happy energy.
Richey1962
I’m so excited for you guys! I hope you guys get it!  🤍🤞🏻🤞🏻
actively crying and hoping the best for them
Love seeing Shane and mama adams talking to Shane. So cute. This would be an amazing home for you. You can always do half time
SHANE “well I only have one shirt” LOL i missed him SO much he brings so much laughter to my life! my mom and I love watching videos with you and Shane 🤍💕
I feel like they both need/should take a break from LA!! Especially when trying to start a family!!
The house is beautiful. I teared up at how happy you both were looking at this house talking about your future.
This house is beautiful!
Yes! Move here! 💕
I want a house like this when I grow up .. I love it sm !! this house is giving me inspiration to work hard !
That House is EVERYTHING.....
yall better be prepared to properly care for horses and animals if you get a "farm"
Darn cliff hanger just sitting here saying “and then…” over and over like the scene in “Dude Where’s My Car”
Rylands dad is so cute ♥️
Amazing house. Luv EVERYTHING! What a great place for family and the fur babies! 😻🐶😍🥰🌟💫🇦🇺
Hell i love that house
Yesssss HERE for it. Loving the vibes.
Shane you better get back on YouTube. everyone deserves another chance:)
What about Shane's mom? 🙁
This house has a similar vibe to your current home, but also feels like a breath of fresh air. So happy for you both ❤
If shane doesnt wanna leave his mom she can live in the barn they have its so cute they can renovate it, or they can also just visit her from once in a while.
Where's the swimming pool?
I cried a little watching this. Nothing like a new home to start fresh! Seems like a perfect place
You guys seem happier always in CO. It doesn't seem like LA and the surrounding area are great for anyone. That property is stunning. Bonne chance
House is beautiful man get it 🔥
Gosh I miss hearing so much from Shane!!! This warmed my heart so much, the entire video! For two such insanely wealthy people… the humbleness and down to earth never fails to shine bright through you both!!
Think of all the makeover videos
Holy shit that house is incredible
Is any one thinking about Shane’s mom right now ?
Y’all, maybe a great big house but in the middle of town!!! Like Starbucks? Food deliveries?  That awesome home needs a serious Gardner and just the time to sweep the porches?  Too much upkeep. Best of luck !
I just want to give vicki a hug thats all
That house is beautiful and I can see them growing old there!
Papa  Adams is so precious!
Hot damn, that’s a great house. I’m very excited for you guys and I wish you luck!
Do you not have to wear seatbelts in the states?
Omg… you guys have to win that bid!!!!!  It’s THE PERFECT ESTATE for you both and your future family!!!!!!!  I’m on the edge of my seat waiting to see your next video!!!!
Come back shane fuck cancel culture
The house has that perfect Shane and ryland esk that you guys need in your lives. If you guys don’t buy this house I will be so sad
Love seeing you guys out together. What a beautiful house. Your wedding would look awesome here. Hope to see more of you in this house. Its like a dream come true.
Wait why did Shane stop making videos I. His channel
The suspense!
So ooo Shane's mom can live in the guest house in the barn?! Its perfect!!
Sometimes your dreams grow and change as you grow and change and that's ok.
A CLIFFHANGER!!!!!😭😭😭😭 OMG. I KIND OF LOVE THE HOUSE!!! I WOULD LOVE A POOL!!!!
can I just say i LOVE that shane paused to say hi in the mirror as he was passing through the bathroom..😍 happy daysss
Putting out good vibes that you guys can get that house!
Omg please do more family vlogs 💕
" at least I'm a democrat" 😭🤣
I’ve only ever said “bubble guts” when I have the runs 😂
Hoping the shane witch hunt can finally be over. I miss watching his videos so much. Literally Shane… I’m 29 and started watching you when I was in high school.  Your life journey has been so inspiring. I’ve ALWAYS been in your corner. Social media and the “norm” is constantly changing. You handle it well. Keep being you.
Go for it you only live once!! And having family around you you shouldn’t have any second thoughts!!! MOVE!!!!
AHH DO IT!!
I feel like I’m every video Morgan says “Tractor” Obviously she NEEDS a tractor
You deserve to be happy and find roots ,I know LA is amazing ,but Colorado is a wonderful place to settle down and enjoy the outdoors .Seen Shane smiles make my day !
Love your LA house, but this, this is IT. Already by the look of the house outside and the lake, this is my dream. The inside of the house is amazing and feels safe, cozy and beautiful:-)
13:09 shanet 🤩😩
Not only do they have nicknacks but they have places for more of them
Dreams change nothing wrong with that ❤️❤️
This house FEELS like you guys.
If y’all don’t don’t move in, I’m getting it for myself.
You're house is soon gonna be haunted now because shane will see and feel random things and tell us about it .
THIS HOUSE IS GOALS AND A HALF
did you get it?!??:) I’m so happy for you guys
Brooo posttt the other part NOWWWWWW
Move there, take Shane's mom with!
I wish I had this kind of loving, healthy, supportive relationship with my family. You guys are all so close and caring, it makes me so happy for you and so sad for myself at the same time. I'm stuck in los angeles right now, can't even afford to live, but if I had the opportunity to get out I would 100% take it and move to a place like that. Follow what makes you guys happy, you don't owe LA anything. I have little hope for my happy future but it still makes me happy to see others find their joy and happiness.
Buy it please
The door for your horsey to come great you is so cute! Manifesting that country girl horse life for you! 🙏  🐎 💛
Not me waving at Shane as he waves into the mirror. lmfao
I just realized I am the Morgan of the family... and I couldn't be happier :)
Oof. That cliffhanger! I hope it’s good news but I feel like it may not be. The market is nuts right now and I think there’d be stiff competition for that property.
So many signs this is meant to be yours and Shane's home. The Scream swing, the Dawson's Creek pond, the pig sign, the knick knacks...😭❤
No the cliffhanger leaving crying at the end 🥲
I'm litterally about to cry. Im moving in with you guys. You'll need a pond cleaner or something
This house is everything!! I love how Shane gets so excited about the knickknacks. 😅💗
It's a gorgeous house. Maybe you could rent it until you are ready to move? Didn't take long for Shane to be into moving!
You guys HAVE to move here.
I’d say go for it!
I love how Cookie has no issues going to new houses. Queen.
Omg this is the house of mg dreams!! BUY IT!!!
Omg! The house is gorgeous!
Hope you get this house!
This is a dream home !!!! I’m in love !!!!! I hope they buy 🥰✨
Im all for leaving LA!
I am excited for you both if you decide to buy that house and actually move in. It is not as big as your house in LA but its much more homey.
Love you! You have know idea how much you have helped me during rough times!
I can’t explain the emotions this video made me feel. I was crying almost the whole video. I have been watching Shane forever and have always love him and supported him. When he meet ryland I install fell in love with their relationship and Roland himself. I am so happy to see them both in a happy spot. They have built such a beautiful life and just continue to grow and prosper together. It just all seems so perfect and amazing. I love you all and I hope the blessing keep coming your way. ♥️
My heart felt warm this entire video I’ve been following you guys since I was 12 (Shane) and then both of you now I am 25 and I feel like you guys deserve that house and to be surrounded by family and people that truly care !!! I felt such joy, even got a little emotional ❤️❤️❤️ I’m happy you both are stronger than ever
Ahhh…don’t leave me hanging!!!
❤️💕❤️💕❤️💕❤️
Yes!!! I know exactly where this house is and it’s stunning!! Come to colorado so I can run into you at target!! Xoxo
Not a damn cliffhanger !!! 😭
Wow. Wowowowowow! I was getting teary eyed! This is everyone's dream and it makes me so happy for you  both!! Xoxxo I'm sure it's a little unsettling having to choose Co over CA as you finally begin to settled into your recent dream home but I really feel good things happening for you guys in this new property
U don’t have to move in right oway u can rent it for a year or 2
Hope you get the house
You put an offer on the house and……😭😭😭😭😭please say you got it!!!!!
i love you shane and ryland keep safe 🙏
Perfect location for a wedding
Am I the only one who listens to the podcast and basically knows they didn’t get it? Still hoping I’m wrong but Lizzie kind of gave it away.
AND WHAT???!!!! I cannot take the suspense I need to know NOW !!!
New beginnings!!! I hope you guys got the house!!!
It's illegal to leave a cliffhanger like that, just so ya know.
Love the house!! Dream house for sure!
I live rylands dad he’s so sweet
I really hope you guys get this house the whole time you guys were smiling.
Noooooo don’t end it like thattt.. I need more 😂😂
I hope it’s yours! It seems perfect. So many signs point to it being where you should all be… The wooden pig on the wall sealed it for me. Love you guys 💜 🐷
Love you Shane!!
Yea yall need to buy that house lmao if u dont i will hahahah
I just love seeing how genuinely happy and healthy Shane is lately. I’m so happy and proud for him and Ryland.
I loved that house for you guys. I hope you get it.
PETITION you get two houses for you,ryland and your mom for the price of your LA home 😭💕
I hope y’all get that house is so nice
WHAT A CLIFF HANGER But on another note, i love how happy they all seemed in Colorado. I hope it worked out 😣💖
Ahhh this made me so sad ahhh but I’m so happy for you guysssssss
Yes move! LA is toxic Shane needs this! I love how happy everyone looks.. That looks much more fitted for you both especially the fact you are going to be close to family!
You need to get this house. This house is beautiful.
It's so perfect in Colorado💖 Good luck guys.
Sell your LA house & go to CO!!! Love that house & better vibes 💙
Buy that house!
With Ryland its always, Me Me Me Me! closer to his family, back to his home. what about Shane?
The house is beautiful! Shane I can see you writing in that office!
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW GOOD SHANE IS LOOKING?? THOSE WORKOUTS HAVE DEFINITELY PAID-OFF SIR!!
You need to update this vlog like tomorrow! Y'all can't leave me hanging like that.
This is my dream home! You should buy it!
The house is beautiful!! I REALLY HOPE YOU GUYS GOT IT! 😍🤩
Glad I'm not the only one bawling after this video.  This house is Ryland and Shane's souls combined so effortlessly.  Thanks for showing us this, it has really warmed my heart. Fingers crossed for you guys.
Lowkey scared me when Ryland said “I can’t leave our house” referring to their place in LA. I think he’s always been the boujee lifestyle type and worries about losing all of that, but the vibes here were immaculate!! It just felt different, I think Colorado is good for both of them after the shit they’ve endured in LA. Change is good and being close to family who supports and loves you is even better.
IF YALL DONT MOVE ILL BE SO MAD😭😭
I just adore how Shane is very loved by Ryland's family. ❤️
Congrats!!!!! Thats a beautiful house!!! Country living is the place to be. So happy for you both!!! I bet the stars will be amazing. You will probably have a good sunrise and good sunsets. Super sweet!
This vlog almost made me cry. I could sense the excitement in your eyes. That house is somewhere you will be infinitely happy.
Oh wow the skylight 😍 so beautiful house 🏡
It’s BEAUTIFUL! Buy it and move in!!!👍🙏😄💞
A cliffhanger... I love it! 🤞🤞🤞
Wait I’m so excited for you guys! I wish you both the best life!
i just couldn’t stop saying how happy i am for you guys in my head. this is YOUR house. it truly is
The house is ahhhmaziinnggg
Omg! I’m so excited for your guys growing future🥺🥺 I just want to see your little family already 🥺♥️
my dream omg 😭😭😭😭😂
Ryland if you don't buy that house, I'm going to fly over there and buy it! It's STUNNING holy shit
If i could, i would buy that house. Take the risk or loose the chance! 😉
go Shane and Ryland <3
i think EVERYONE agrees that the house and the place is PERFECT for the life u guys want to live, i really hope it works out !.!. ❤️❤️❤️
So happy for the next chapter in your and shanes life i hope you find your forever place 💛
Wholesome! Hope you guys get it
Not a huge fan anymore, but I think this house is miles better than anything you would get in LA, just off of the vibes. It seems like a calm retreat to really find true moral. I'd be out of LA in two secinds if I could buy this lolz
Omg THIS HOUSE 😍 It’s beautiful - literally perfect!
The house and property is beautiful and LA is so toxic… Go for it!
You need this house!
What part of Colorado is this? Stunning! 💚💙💜🧡
So excited for the move!!!
I feel like the skeleton in the basement was a sign for them to move there 😂😂
This house is stunning!!!! ❤❤❤
I actually watched this vlog 5 times cos the house is too dreamy!! I command you guys to BUY IT and MOVE to Colorado already! You’ll be happier there, that’s all that matters❤️
this house is everything!!! you guys could have your wedding here!!!!😍
Stunning house!
I really hope they get this house. Omg it's so perfect for them and they seemed so genuinely happy. ❤️❤️❤️
This house made me wanna cry from how beautiful it is lol. I wish you two the best in getting the house! It looks like you guys live there already <3 Its okay to have a new dream!
But who needs a podcast shed when you can have a podcast BARN 😍😍 really hoping this works out because I love this for y’all!
BUY IT!
Wow this place is beautiful it gives me serotonin
how about shans mom
I can't wait to see shane again
It’s soo pretty I can see them raising a family in that home
Perfect ending! 😁
What about shanes mom? Would she move with you guys? Are you guys still close?
Idk but I wanted to cry with y’all for this house. I want this house so bad just as much as y’all lol. Can I move in too?
"I'm always on board to move somewhere people eat more" SAME lol Ryland geeking over the split door was so cute. You all NEED this house. It's absolutely perfect (and I am hella picky).
I’m crying for y’all😭 congratulations❤️❤️
Such a big fan can’t what till Shan Comes back
I’m happy for them starting a new chapter, but I lowkey don’t want Shane to come back after all the controversy. I watched him since the beginning and used to love him. Everyone else seems to have moved past it, but just I’m over him honestly.
LA is so toxic… good views and family always has good vibes. That house is gorgeous yall. If you don’t get it, I will!!
Shane foreshadowed all this with Animal Crossing lol. He was preparing for this!!!!!
That house & yard is amazing!! My dream house. Y’all need to get out of L.A, it’s toxic. Shane’s mom can move into the guest house too, if she wants to move also. It’s perfect for you guys!  ❤️❤️ I hope they accept your offer.
Seriously though … I pray you guys get this home.  The happiness in both yours and Shane’s voices and the excitement… that’s everything.  The fact that you both can see your future play out in this home… I really genuinely believe you guys need to move here.  Get away from the negativity that’s in LA… please please please make the right decision.
I say go for it.
This house is absolutely amazing. You guys definitely deserve something good coming your way. <3 Cant wait for the next vlog!
And plenty of room for Shane to have his mom come and stay for long periods of time…..I think it was meant to be.
Watching you two fall in love with the house was beautiful 😍
Ryan ! You can just have a small apartment in LA and move to Colorado !
Tell me why I searched “gabbie Hanna” and this video popped up as the first result lol. Can someone check the tags?
Ryland Shane ! If y’all don’t move !!! I love this house !!! Y’all would be so happy !
This is my dream house omggg 😍
Omg this is so wonderful,leaving LA is the best thing.
I found out how country I really was watching this video 😂🤦🏽‍♀️ it’s a pond.
if you all move there you could literally have your wedding in your backyard!!!!
Kind of bummed that Ryland is trying to take Morgan's moment to shine. She literally just bought her house, why not let her have her moment.  Same with Lizzie idk Ryland is coming off as a hater now idk why.
YALL BETTER GET THIS HOUSE! IT IS BREATHTAKING AND HALF THE COST OF THE OTHER HOUSE COME ON NOWWWWWWWW LAKES AND BARNS AND SKY LIGHTS AND PRIVACY AND SLEDDING HILLS IMAGINE DECORATING THE OUTSIDE AND THE PINE TREES FOR CHRISTMAS AHHHH CAN I MOVE IN lol
Yasss 💙💙
It’s the ending for me……………….
omg i cannot wait for the next vlog.. I hope you get the house it is so perfect
Born and raised 5th generation Colorado native, and it's definitely a beautiful state to live in, I approve of y'all moving 🤣🤣
Nooooooooo not a cliff hanger. That house is stunning if u don’t buy it I will. It’s perfect.
yes yes yes would be the absolute best place to grow mentally and grow as a family!
Not you leaving us thinking you didn’t get the house
I’m in love with that house!!! I’m crying because how much I love it!! You need to buy it!!!! Omg please!! It’ll make both of your lives better!!! New house fresh start!!!
As much as I love LA and the current place you and Shane have it would be a regretfull mistake if you didn't move here like it's the dream farmhouse and if you wanna leave LA and move to Colorado then I say do it
I cried watching this. So happy for you two and your future ❤️
I’m obsessed and so happy for you both!
This video is so cute and exciting because it is beautiful to see when someone thrives with their partner. Good luck with hopefully your future new home<3
Buy it, there are feelings in that house that aren’t in your other home as much.  Beautiful. Imagine it at winter with snow, wow
Please please PLEAAAAAASE GET THIS HOUSE AND MOVE HERE!! It is such a beautiful place, it has such a homey vibe and I could totally see you guys growing a family here. The LA house is GORGEOUS but I do believe that this place is filled with positive energies and so many new possibilities.
What a beautiful home... i pray you all get it...... you two belong there .... wishing you both the best
Just moveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee and take me with you please.
I think it's a marvelous idea to move from California! Lools like you guys would be happy there.
So.... is Shane Dawson back?
That house was so cute omg
Also can we all agree that Ryland’s dad is literally a vibe💀🤚🏽 your dad is so damn funny
I hope yall get it you both seem so happy, but hearing Shane that excited almost made me start to cry.  Prayers yall can get it. 😁
Get this house and lease your house in California, if you ever need to go back go you still have your beautifull house
I am so happy for them but I am so mad at Shane and Ryland - no one is talking about Teresa. Is Shane just gonna leave her behind? Why is Ryland all like my family my family what about Shane's I am so sad for Teresa.
Do it do it do it!!! This is the HAPPIEST I’ve seen Shane and you in a long time!!! Since y’all got engaged!!!🥰
I'm so happy to see all his family thriving for this house. Hope you do get it🥰
I’m so proud of y’all!
This house brought so much joy to all of you! This makes me so happy i love all the smiles on your faces this made me so happy 💕
Leave LA now!
BYEEEE L.A!!!!! This house is perfect for y’all!!!!! Omg. We need the next vlog now!!!!
OMFG ... that house is so beautiful. It's perfect and completely move in ready. I'm so hoping that you get it. Being in Colorado with all of Ryland's family will be wonderful and Shane's mom can stay in the guest house. Fingers and toes crossed that it all works out.
I’m soooooo excited for you guys that I’m crying! That house is beautiful!!!
Can you ask Morgan if I can move in with her so she’s not lonely
Now THIS feels like home!!!!
That house is a dream! 😍
SO EXCITED FOR THE NEXT VLOOOOG!!
No Postmates = Rylands food
Omgggggg I love it !!!!
The house is beautiful
Ok don’t make me jealous 🥺🥺🥺
Wishing you both all the happiness in the world on your new adventure. YOU DESERVE IT
You guys HAVE to get this place!
Even if it doesn’t end up being this house, y’all are clearly so much happier there. You can see it in your eyes. It’s okay to grow and move on. Dreams can change and that’s okay!
Can you imagine insulting the entire state you’re about to move in and have them hate you before you even get there.  Basically they’re downgrading from LA high class to Colorado lower class fat people. 😲🤭That’s basically what I hear ha ha …stay tune for another cancellation lol 😂
I hope they get this house.
while i truly have ZERO negative thoughts or feelings regarding shane and ryland, i’m not a fan anymore. i just occasionally pop in when a title in my recommended interests me. but honestly, if they don’t move into this house, i will be deeply disappointed. it would be incredible for them. life changing even.
I wish you all the best on this mew journey. You and Shane both look so happy. Cant wait for the next vlog! Follow your dreams and happiness will always follow!
Soooooo get it it's beautiful
All I could do during this whole video is smile from ear to ear and yell “BUY IT!!” at the tv😂💗
The house was meant for y’all. I see Shane living in that house with small piglets & just living life so peacefully. If I was able to afford it I would go. That’s my dream to have a farmhouse with a bunch of doggies. Honestly LA is so toxic, that home is a new peaceful beginning. I was born and raised in LA but I would definitely leave if I had the chance.
Everyone can have an opinion of them but this looks perfect and it made them so happy. I'm happy for them and Morgan to be closer to family. All the drama doesn't matter in life. Just be happy. That's all life is about. Forget everyone else and live your own life. 💜
GUYS BUY THAT HOUSE!! omg it will be so good for both of you to leave LA
I miss Shane so much !!
Guys, even if it didn't work out and yall didn't get the house, you just gotta accept that this wasn't meant for you and that something greater is coming for you. Whether you realize it or not, or whether you think it's possible or not, the universe has your back. It may just deliver you something beyond your wildest dreams.
My reaction to Ryland's dad saying "at least I'm a Democrat" -  😍😍😍😍
You have to get this house it’s a fucking dream!
I feel this House for y’all like it’s genuinely perfect for you guys. I love the way you guys both lit up as soon as you saw the whole house. It’s a beautiful start for your future and a great new experience. I hope you guys do move here it’s such a beautiful home. Full support and I love you guys so much. Be happy. ❤️❤️‍🔥
I fucking love you and your entire family!!! Wish I could be part of it hahaha so nice that you love being so close together.
Wow! Many blessings guys in your new chapter in your lives.  God bless, Be safe, Peace
When is Shane coming back
You could just feel how happy this is making Shane and it’s really so beautiful to watch. The family that you guys have created together really has some serious staying power and that’s something very rare these days. Brought a tear to my eye, happy to tear! 🥺🥰🥺
Also what about your own Marijuana strain?! Even Steve Erkul has his own strain!!!
RENT OUT YOUR OTHER HOUSE....if you can obvi...such a good investment
That house is absolutely amazing! Y’all are destined to be there!! 😍😍😍
Omg that house is beautiful!!!! Im so hoping you get it!!! Its perfect to grow a family!!! And the dogs having all that to roam!!!
Omg the house is beautiful.
I really hope you guys do get it🥺🖤
This house is Everything! I hope you guys get it! Loved seeing how happy everyone was 2!!!!
Love the house. Love the video. Love the background music.  Can I come with? I’m nice 😊 When you get settled in can you please vlog every single day for us? 🥰🙏🏻🙏🏻
Awww, what a heartfelt video, thank you for sharing, sending many blessings to all of you in your endeavors and may you reach your happiness where ever that may be! :D
This is my dream entertaining house 😩 so beautiful!!!!!!
LA suuuucks just do it guys <3
CNt wait to see if it happens for you guys. I think this move would be a great thing for the both of you. Good luck and lo e the house.
Shane returns to ...... Colorado!!! A whole Shane and Ryland in the Wild!!! Ryland bakes and Shane tries to fish!! Shane can do his makeup in a boat and Ryland gardens?! And please get chickens!!!
I can just imagine them doing a video with a swavorski blinged tractor 🚜 LOL 😂 ❤️
Buy a house in Colorado , enjoy your time with family . I’m excited for the future for you guys 💜💜
love the house but your stealing Morgan's thunder
I think moving out of LA would be amazing for them. Especially in CO near Rylands family, they are all so close, and are amazing with Shane. It would be an awesome next chapter for them.
You will be so happy there. Shane's Mum can stay in the guest house and family is so close. Get away from the toxic LA
My sister lives in Denver <3
Awwww I hope you guys get the house. You’ll be so much more happier there
I just love that Shane is back. Not even trying to take away from the beautiful house. But Shane makes the videos so much better with his questions to your family and talking to your dad. Omg. Just love both of yall
I always questioned if y’all was Christian then I heard him say he’s glad he’s a democrat now Ik they not
It literally looks like the old house and the new house all combined it’s perfect
omg that house is literally their old house b the one they have now mixed together it’s perfect 😭😂
Ahhh!!
It's Shane's wave in the mirror for me ❤️😭🤗🥲
Guys just sell your house and move here!!!!
Love It!!!! It’s gorgeous!
I'm sorry but hearing Shane freaking out makes me happy, I've been his fan for the longest, and then rylands family being so excited for them just melts my heart. I hope you guys make the move. 💗💗💗
Seriously, the barn...new podcast area with the guest house!! Like. Why would you even consider staying in California. And wth are these people doing selling that house!!!
Please please pleasssse tell me you got this house. Idk why but this feels so right for you guys
why do people have to live in a house fish live in the water they don’t need a house so, yeah
Damn. I would love a house like that. I’m planning to leave SoCA and just don’t know where to plant my roots
Ok why am I emotional 😭
I’m sure Shane would miss his mom. Unless momma Dawson is down to move to
I want to live here!!!
Ah, when you grow as a, couple you end up making decisions that are about your support system and you find bigger dreams. So happy for you in whatever happens. Shade deserves a place where he can see the seasons, away from drama and triggers. You two will marry and find your way.
THATS MY DREAM HOUSE 🏡
guys guys this is it i hope they are happy
Ryland uploads a full ad for the house *gets the house*
I'd be happy to live in the LA house for y'all while your in CO
Well, hmu if you want my mom and I to house-sit your SoCal home for you.
House is so beautiful!!!!

This video just made me so emotional. So happy for you guys!
Okay can someone make my house look like this house! This is my dream house all the way around
Only good thing in LA is Shane’s mom
I’m fucking CRYING
RYLAND! You cannot leave us with such a big cliff hanger!😂😂I need to know😂
Guys. Buy this house so I can dream that one day you will reward me for my years of support by letting me come live with you. This house is... also everything Ive ever wanted. Wow.
Gorgeous house, this is where you raise families and be closer to your own family!  Do it, do it, do it!

OKAY YESSSS!!!! This house was literally built for you two!! Like as soon as I saw it I thought to myself, yeah Shane and Ryland are going to be living here one day with a beautiful family❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I hope you get it!!!🤞🤞🤞🤞
I can see Shane making conspiracy videos in that office omg 😍😍
This is it this is the first video of there family farm vlog
This vlog made me cry! 🥺 one, cuz I was so happy to see Shane so excited and it’s so sweet how he just blends into your family! I hope you guys get the house Ryland, I think moving out of California would be good for you both it’s just too toxic.   I’ll be praying and manifesting that you two get the house ☺️
I really want you to buy that house and move. You two deserve the peace and happiness that shined through this video while touring it.
Yay! You’re new home is the PERFECT place to get married! Congratulations!
That house is dope! I’m obsessed with the kitchen and backyard. I love how it’s so big but yet it feels super cozy and “tight” in all the rooms 🥰
Awww love you shane! Your the best
That would be perfect for y’all 🤗 you even have a spot for Shane’s momma ! Bring her with you !! I love seeing Shane happy ! I miss him so much 🥺
Split level home! It’s perfect for you guys. Not as many stairs, nice and bright with lots of natural light. Lots of closet space. Lots of outdoor space for the animals. ❤️ Love it!
That house is beautiful! Dream farmhouse I’m so jealous 💕
Shane being so excited was so freaking cute. I adore you all so much. I hope you do move to Colorado! It’s the best here :)
Oh I love this for you 🥺🥺🥺 I’m from the south where you grow up with your family all around you and it’s the absolute best! ❤️
That house is gorgeous! What a perfect family home ❤️
Omg Dad. Love him.
Please buy it and leave LA
I also house sit for free!
the thing that makes me think shane is actually a good person is with how much rylands parents love him and and i trust morgan ‘s insight about being around people that care for him even tho he has a done some bad thinks in the past and if u can’t seem some kind of growth with shane then idk what y’all be looking at
Spoiler alert they didn’t get the house!
I am fucking OBSESSED with this house. 😍
I’m so happy for you guys 💜💜💜
If they don’t get it I want that house please
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH! It's amazing what the last year has done for people's priorities, and I think getting the hell out of LA and closer to people who love and support you will be a blessing for you two. The house is to die for, Colorado is amazing, and being closer to nature away from hustle and bustle is so freeing.
"Not sponsored by Brad" killed me
I’m crying I’m so happy for y’all. I have the best vibes and feelings . You are meant for this house Shane and Ryland !!!
Ryland and Morgan's dad *checks hat color* "at least I'm a democrat"
Wishing you guys get the house....Best of Luck!!!!  Sounds like the Best Family, Comfort, Fun Loving, Beautiful place to be!
Omg!!!!!! I'm SO JEALOUS!!!! It's making me think of where I live and how I would love to relocate. Moving somewhere new and better would be an awesome change.   BUY IT!!! THERES NOTHING IN LA! CONGRATS TO THE BOTH OF YOU!!! I REALLY HOPE YOU GUYS MOVE THERE!!! LOVE YOU BOTH AND GOOD LUCK! ❤❤❤❤
I am living for these vlogs Ryland.
That house looks like it was MADE for you both! I wish you luck! I hope it works out!
Ok so random, but can anyone tell me the style or name of Shane’s sunglasses? I used to have the same pair and lost them and forget what they are called. I know they are Raybans but have no idea what the style name/number is. Help a brotha out please!!
That home is breathtaking ! I wish I lived out there Bc I would totally be trying to buy it 😂😂  But I will scream if they get outbid on that house! The housing market is so crazy right now
The change of scenery would be nice for the both of you. But I feel like you won’t because of the podcast. Lol
Hey, I recognize that house! If u buy it u'll be neighbors with my good friend.
I hope you guys get the house it’s gorgeous sending good wishes 🤞it’s the perfect family home
🥰
please move! L.A is toxic af and you dont need that if you wanna settle down
You guys should definitely get the house it is beautiful and you guys look so happy just looking at it

Awe Shane’s picture at the end is so cute
😥😥😥😥 my whole emotion thru this video!
This is amazing!! I hope you move there. It’s so beautiful and peaceful. It’s everything you both need and deserve.
Colorado is boring as hell unless you’re into camping and shit.  I’ve gone a few times when I was in a long distant relationship . Didn’t work out, he was bad in bed anyways 🤣 he was super hot though
I love everything about this video! So many sweet moments. Can't wait for the next! And so happy to see move of Shane and see him so happy!
That was a bitch move with the ending, but IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU GUYS!!!! GAHHH 🙌💜❤️
Aw seeing shane so happy makes my heart warm as a resident of LA yes it so toxic here so get the house rylan and shane❤️
It's beautiful ❤️
I'm worried they're gonna get doxxed from this
Oh I hope y'all get this house. It's so beautiful!
This is SO exciting
I hope you guys get it!!!! I’m getting good vibes!!!!!!
If you guys move I will literally shit like this would be the best thing possible I wish you guys the best xoxo
OMG, that is your forever home.
I would def leave la For that house
Yasssssssssss bitchhhhh please I just moved here and need couple/kid friendsssss hmu #coisthebest
I HOPE YOU MOVE THERE!!!
What about Shane’s family?! I get ryland wants to move closer to his family but it’s not fair to Shane having to leave his mom behind 🤷🏻‍♀️
So in part 1 I thought you were going to live on the edge of a cliff lol. Now I’m left thinking maybe you lost the house to another offer. Ahh I want a spoiler so bad! 😱 I hope it works out! ❤️
Omg do it!! I think moving out of LA would be so good for you guys
❤❤❤
I really hope they move out of LA and get this house and mama Dawson can move to Colorado too.
Halfway thru the video and I’m crying for you guys 🥺
Maybe they could keep the LA house and use it maybe in the winter if it’s too cold in Colorado
Shane, i love seeing your face back on camera, i love seeing you and ryland and the commentary and just your love for each other. Just love you guys
hi
It looks a lot like their house in California.
put on your seatbelts😩
As a realtor, your realtors did an amazing job getting that house ready and showing it!!!! I think it’s the perfect match for you and this is the stuff that agents’ dreams are made of! Finding the PERFECT MATCH.
This house feels so much more like you guys. It’s homey and eclectic but still chic and stylish
They definitely bought the house. They wouldn’t show the whole house and not have it. They post these a few weeks after everything is confirmed.
Hope they move and he does THE SIP with Morgan and drops Lizzie, she's annoying.
Shane 🤩❤🙌
I really hope they get this house!!
What about Shane's mom she has know one else in la. I don't think! would love to see her more so maybe she could move with them!
You could buy the new house and turn the house in L.A. to an Airbnb and then you would make a profit of it people travel to California all the time and then you can use the L.A. house whenever you want cause it's still your house and you could hire a cleaning service to come clean it for you
I love love love it. I hope you get it. Hearing you guys so happy makes my heart happy
This house is everything 😍😍😍😍😍
I love it! I can see you guys and the fur kiddies living here happily.
I hope they keep both of those houses
that house is perfect for you guys! 🥺 i love this so much.
Hell yes so happy for u both this is a big step and I hope it all works out
Please get it 🥺
Imagine the 4th of July barbecues they could have there. ❤❤❤❤❤
Why don’t you get this house move into this house keep your house in la and rent the one in la out and make profit off of and keep it if you ever need it?
Ok but y is there barn bigger than my dream house 🏡
THIS HOUSE IS A DREAM OMFG
thank YOU so much for giving us the privilege to see this journey!! <3
With that ending they better have gotten it… I’m crying
Hope you do move, when ya do.... Welcome to Colorado
This house was literally made for you guys!
please don’t pass this house up 🥺
I really hope you did put an offer on this house cause maybe it's just time to move away from LA
i love this house
The house and land is perfect! I have horses and can't even afford to keep them on my place because we rent and can't afford an acreage rental. You are so lucky to be able to afford something so perfect. I truly hope you get it ☺️☺️❤️❤️
Shane and Rylands dad🥺🥺🥺
Please please please buy this house!!! I can feel the happiness that will come into your lives!!
You better be moving!!!! This house is all the goals!!!
This is a move you 100% need to make.  Shanes mom can stay in the guest house/barn.  This is exactly what you both have  always talked about wanting, and it's right in front of you.  DO IT!
I've lived in Colorado for a great majority of my life & recently moving to the more farmland area feels really nice & so calm. I use to want to move to California, but I'm glad to still be here.
That house was made for y'all,Its Absolutely Perfect! The air is cleaner,so it's really better for you. Not just that,but the views,like a little piece of heaven!🌷🌻🌺 I can see y'all there already,So happy,with a permanent Smile and having the best Life!😁😻💜💙💛
I will definitely be saying “bubble guts” now.
This is my fucking dream house as well, if y’all don’t get it I will cry
I'm kinda sad that garret wasn't there for this like it has so many knick knacks and a skeleton and i just-
OMG that house is perfect in every way! Honestly, I think it would be great for everyone! And like Ryan said, you don't have to sell your current house if you don't want to. I can see you both so happy in that home!
And what 😭😭 i cant wait
I could totally see you guys there honestly
morgan kills me XD
now can we have shane officially come back and make new videos
I’m going to be bummed if they didn’t get the offer 😢
This house is amazing!!!😍
Colorado is so beautiful. There's good schools, good communities, and the homes are just built different over there. I would love to buy a ranch out there if I could afford it. You should invest in real estate out there because some of the places are just one of a kind beautiful. You should look at some of the places around cherry creek, pretty great!.
i feel like if they do move there, shane’s mom would come with and live above the barn. she’d be close and shane would be with al the people he loves. honestly this whole please looks perfect for them
That house is absolutely gorgeous and perfect for you and Shane and the fur babies and human babies 🥰🥰🥰 I can’t wait for the next vlog, I’m so excited to see it!💗
I really hope they get the house !!! They will be so happy La is too toxic
Tbh I don’t like the inside…personal preference seems too small and too dark
I hope Morgan hurries to fill that house up with bodies because I bet the other 14 people who put in offers had families or at least more than 1 human going to live on that huge property. And yall lived in LA, so much homeless.
Bitch we need this moving content please and thank you you all need to move get the fuck outta LA
This video is like everything …
Dad is THE BEST! 🥰 This whole family is amazing. Shane’s mom and brother could move too and the vlog footage could be amazzzzing. 😁😁
This was such a beautiful video
Im so happy for them ..they deserve to have a new start in a gorgeous place!  Also love seeing the positivity in the comments ,its so sweet
DO IT youv one life DO IT, this place has way better vibes than your LA house.  i reckon this place will do you both the world of good.
I’m sobbing. I wish I had this family. Shit.
Getting this house should be a no brainer
Ahhhhhhh 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I really think you two should move, I just see you guys finding so much more peace away from LA
And what!!!!! Why u gotta end like that
BEST WISHES QUEENS!!!!
cliffhangers 😅
Wow 😯 beautiful
OMG Ryan and Shane, the house and property is beautiful!!!! 😩💜💜 And it’s less than the house in California, PLUS you’re close to family?!?! If your gut is telling you THIS is the house of your dreams, yall need to snatch it before someone puts a good contract.   By the way, I suggest getting a fenced area for the doggos. Obviously there’s a lot of wildlife in Colorado and it’s easy for dogs to get lost if they’re the type to get curious and chase something.   I think you guys should totally take it, how beautiful and peaceful would it be to live in a place like this? 😌✨😍  EDIT: Just saw the ending, good luck guys, I hope you have the best offer and you get the house 😭🤞🏼
Morgan and rylands dad saying “at least im a democrat” @ the hats was AMAZING.
What part of Colorado is this?
It's totally ok to own more than one house, you don't have to give up one for the other, especially if you are not ready. You have options! If you get this new one, all it's missing is a legit pool to swim in. I could see you could own two houses. I think if you can afford it, keep both houses or try it out somehow and then if you find you not happy there, at least you have another house to go back too. Or one could be a vacation house etc.
I just sat and smiled like an idiot for 20 minutes. It makes me so happy to see you guys this happy. 💗 I cried happy tears for you guys. 😢😭
Ryland seems like he wasn't into it as everyone else. It's a big step to pick up your lives and move to another state.
This house could be the beginning of the new chapter of your lives. Hope you did the deal. I had bubble guts myself watching this vídeo tho
PERIODT! My bitches movin!! Eow!!! 🤣🤣
Ryland. Shane. This is the one. This is YOUR house, dont let it go
the house and the land is beautiful .... the best thing is if your offer would be accepted is being closer to family.... good luck and hoping that you guys get the house. can't wait to see the next video/vlog to see what happens.
THIS HOUSE THOUGH!
I’m obsessed with this house, I wish Ryland uploaded a bit more often
I know I’m being picky but where’s the pool👀
Aww I hope Shane agrees with the move. But I understand your mom get her one too.
The house is amazing! Now we need Mama Dawson to move there or stay for a few months of the yr :)
Please stop hiding Shane I miss you
the energy you all projected shows it's meant to be
I literally got chills watching this. I have followed your journey's for years and this house is made for you two
That house is fabulous. It truly has so much to do that you’d never have to leave!  That would be  a beautiful home to raise a family in. As you were walking through it was very easy to see all of you in the space especially during the holidays.  Huge decision but I hope you buy it. The one good thing about your jobs … it’s mobile.  You’ll always go to LA but just not full time. I’ll say a prayer for you two to make the best decision for your family. I love you, Shane and Ryland. Let yourselves be happy. 💕💕
Ahhh you guys! You NEED that house 🥺💛 PLEASE Don’t make us wait a week to find out xx
Definitely should get the house! Hopefully you and lizzie can still do the podcast after you move!!
Wow! What a beautiful house and garden.
Oh I pray Ya'll got it ... Gorgeous Home Great Family Setting.
What a place for your wedding!!!!!!
Omg, move! Put in an offer and GOOOO! Get the fuck out of LA!
This made me so happy I watched it again 😄😊
He said that they got there for the 4th of July … what happened in between now and then ?
Seeing you two makes me so happy. I hope you guys find your home and are happy! Will support you know matter what
And what???
I hope you guys get the house and leave LA best thing I ever did.   Side note. I got so sick from watching this.. motion sickness. But the house is so beautiful it was worth it.
Luv it...

Stg if yall dont get THAT HOUSE…….its already yours!! Its perfect!
Does Shane have family?
I loveeeeeee that house, hello dream home whoever decorated it is amazing lol i hopeeeee they get it !!!!!
This video seriously solidified my love for y’all. Y’all are just precious and I love the bond that Shane has from the whole family.
I definitely prefer this house to their current one 🏡
I'm dying to know how much
I think buying the house would be the start of your new chapter in your life.  The house is beautiful I want to live there ❤
Do it buy the house
Congratulations Ryland and Shane!
Do It! you guys this house is a dream
Shane come back to your channel
There is nothing more curing to the mind and soul than nature ❤️🥰❤️
This is amazing! I’m 100% down for this! This would be great for your relationship, family, and Shane’s mental health to just be away from L.A.  I cant wait to hear more!!
I'm soo Excited for you guys! 💗
When Shane said "omg a little strip pole" I died
That house is beautiful i hope you move!
Do it do it do it! It’s so you and Shane you need a change both of you
I am so incredibly happy for both of you. Rather you get the house or not it's a journey and one you can do together. Love you both!
I love this for you both! I really hope that your offer was accepted and the next vlog will be out very very soon!
You have to take this house it’s so frickin beautiful.
I am speechless. This house is beautiful. I wish nothing but happiness, health, and love for you and Shane. This made me cry. So beautiful. Bring Shane’s mom!!!!!!
I really like this house it’s perfect, and here I am trying to convince Shane and Ryland to buy it through the TV screen 😩😩
Rylands dad got so excited when he saw the house 🥺
I feel like Ryland is so selfish. He just decides he wants to move and now that's what they have to do. And Shane was really thrown into this.
Shane could finally get pigs!
What a beautiful house I’m in love 😍 🙌🏼💚🌈
Omg 😱
I love Morgan
Wonder why owners want to sell it
This made me so happy, it's always nice to see people live out their dreams. And I've always dreamed of owning a place like this with lots of animals. This is the wholesome new direction that I think they all needs and videos are going to be amazing!
Get a couple of horses!!!! Now that Morgan is a cowgirl and has her own farm you guys could ride together… and you won’t need to buy a tractor. ( just a thought)
Morgan: can I sell my house and live in the barn
They need to say goodbye to LA! Start fresh and being happy, I really hope they get this house it fits them so perfectly
It's better then Morgan's dump, what was she thinking.
This is my dream house. It’s everything 💕
Ok but honestly live your best life ryland and shane like please buy the house 🤣
It’s yours!!!
For the record, Morgan did it on her own and paved the way.
Omg guys its "you" - do it! ❤❤
I call them Christmas trees too lol I have one
Leave LA.  Buy this home.  Start living a REAL life.  This home is so beautiful and feels like  HOME.
OMG yessssss!!!
Please shane post the second part to the demon in the house
OH MY GOODNESS....that house and property are amazing!!!!  I hope you guys get it...SO exciting and beautiful <3
It amazes me that people were so drawn and obsessed with LA to begin with. The rest of the world is so much prettier and healthier…. Let’s be real.
This makes me want to cry with joy!!!! How incredibly perfect!! The feeling of peace radiates through this video.
Amazing place, am now jealous😭
You guys need to buy this house
awwwww loved every moment of this vid ! Fingers toes and paws crossed for you
yall should keep this one and buy the other one
it could be a fresh start for you guys and just the perfect house for you two! so cozy
LOVE THIS HOUSE! I can definitely see you both having your wedding there, your dogs would be soo happy. Not only just that I feel like LA can be sooo toxic here Shane and Ryland can take a breather and have animals, and maybe grow some of your own stuff!! Shane could start a series of growing his own vegetables and stuff!! OMG!! And Ryland you can do your yoga and ofc go sledding!!
Oh my goodness, I love this property! DO IT! Grab happily ever after! Get out of L.A., it consumes souls. Morgan will be your neighbor! So much fun! 💙💙
Just the simple fact both of your mental health will definitely benefit from getting away from the hustle of LA, I'd say do it. Take the leap!
I bet they didn’t get it. Sadly. He looked too sad.
This house looks fantastically perfect to start a new chapter in a new area like Colorado! You all deserve to be happy and proud to get where you are today 🔥
Yes shane and ryland! Get the hell out of LA its a toxic wasteland now and not a good place to raise a family. Move and get everything youve had to put on hold going. You guys will be so much happier!
alternate title:  Shane being obsessed with knick-knacks for 20 minutes straight
Where were yall
Awwww!!! I really hope you guys get it! You all seemed so happy! Move Shane's mommmmmmmmm!!!!!!
It's beautiful!!! And it's lovely hearing Shane's laugh again. Awww
I have bubble guts and chills for you both 🥺 it’s so perfect
I felt like the house their in now is just a bigger version of Shane's old one. Lol or is that just me
Sell your LA place and get this NOW!!! Omg it’s amazing.  LA is too toxic, get out of there and into this stunning place!
Ughhhh I’m so happy for you guys!!And Shane you don’t need a scale to show that you’ve lost weight ! You look good lovee 🥲
You know I could live in your barn and take care of your horses. I’m just sayin
It's pretty, but I don't really feel like it's their style. Ryland would have to make it more bougie and blingy.
If you don’t buy that I’m going to riot
Please get it you guys would love it!!
I like the la house more
If that property comes with land, take it! After everything Shane went through I still ❤️ and miss him. LA is toxic so maybe it's time to move on.  Ok if they don't buy it someone will. It is gorgeous!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh I didn’t want this video to end
The house reminds me of caseys from scream
The same sq with land and half the price?!?! Heck year take that -!: see if you can sell the la house for a profit.
You can tell Ryland's parents so want them to move there.
So happy for you guys 🥰🥺
Dad: *literally takes if the hat*  Dad: thank God I'm the Democrat 🤣🙃🙂
I really hope you get this house! I get so good vibes from this. And for Shane´s mental health this would be amazing.
OMGawd what a gorgeous place. The privacy, the space. How amazingly perfect! So much to vlog about for ever. Wow!!!
The house is so beautiful 😍 it’s like out of a magazine. Feels like a dream.
Are you kidding me? You leave this with a cliffhanger, you're posting the next video like tomorrow, right? I can't handle this pressure.
That, is a such PERFECT home it hurts.
Wait but what about shanes mom
I hope u guys get it!!✨🦋😊its everything and more....
THIS IS HEALTHY !!!!!! LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!
mama yaw can live in the barn
Shane looks so happy in this video I’m loving it 🥲☺️
I couldn’t help but smile through out the entire video!! You and Shane deserve so much in this world!! I’m hoping you guys get the house!!💖💖🥺
This house is beautiful! Fingers crossed you guys get it!! I want it so bad FOR you!
Ryland has such an amazing family but I am concerned about Shane’s Mom. Where does she fit into all of this? Theresa is an amazing woman, does she get left behind?
This house is full of good vibes. Really hope you get this house, it's beautiful! I see you growing old together there ❤
RYLAND How do you leave us like that!?!?
So, put me in the barn apartment and I'll be your own personal Postmates as well as take care of your animals gentlemen.
yay
You're crazy if you don't buy that house...!!!!!
This house gives me the forever home vibe that their current house never gave me when they toured it. I knew that their current house was a nice house, but it didn’t give me “this is home” vibes. I love this and I think that they could live happily ever after in it.
I hope you guys get it!! <3 the house is amazing!!!!!
Do it move if you don't get this house you're going to regret it. Take the huge risk and get out of the city it will be so much better for both of you. I want you guys to move to Colorado so badly, you guys are growing up and maturing it's time to settle down and live your dream life, you can go to LA whenever you want. I'm hoping you guys get the house.
That house is PERFECT!
It’s such a beautiful home. The lake, the acres ….. buy buy buy sister! Lol 🧡
They got the house or we would not even be seeing it.
I think this house is PERFECT for you guys
Yessss I say do it!:,)
You could use the barn and lake as a wedding venue!
I wouldn’t think twice, it would be MINE if I could afford it.
The Real Estate Agent knows the type of fish in the pond?! She's done her research wowo
I think you should keep both homes. LA is where Shane's fam is. Colorado is where Ryland's family is. Best of both worlds.
Just to hear Shane so excited is EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!
Omg I can imagine the dogs chasing after a sled with one of y’all’s babies in it during winter 🥺
Please move to there!  the house its AMAZING!
Shane your soul needs this house
"For your backup root beer." I love you guys.
I pray the offer goes through! Absolutely gorgeous and fitting home for you guys.
You never stop dreaming, so a new dream house is possible.
I swear to you…the amount of LOVE & happiness & excitement in this video is honest to God what my soul needed after losing a dear friend this week. To see Shane & Ryland just existing and looking toward the future & just LIVING after such a crazy couple of years just made me so incredibly happy for them. Getting out of LA and surrounded by family, building your life together and sharing it instead of just building content and airing it. I live this new chapter for the both of you!
I can not! I'm so excited!! I'd love this place!!! I can't wait to see more!
Don’t wait so long to lost the next vlog!!
That house and property is beautiful!!!
BUY THIS DANG HOUSE 🥰🥰🥰
Did I miss something? Does cookie live with Shane and ryland full time?
I am screaming!!!!!! I’m here for the Colorado move just bring Lizzie & Chris for podcasts ❤️
I really hope you bought this, fresh start! Perfect house.
Omg u gotta buy that hone it’s beautiful
That house is the visual of a breathe of fresh air
god, i hope they do this!!!!!!! new beginnings...
Please leave LA!
Can I move in too????. So happy for you guys ♡♡
Colorado is love, Colorado is life ❤ from a fellow Coloradoan, I hope it works out for you. I would love to be able to afford to buy a house here some day.
I’m crying.  I’m such a sap.
That home scream you Shane 🥰🥰🥰
Such a wonderful sight to see the excitement in both of you, especially Shane. You both deserve to live in peace and harmony. Be close with positive people and start the forever life you both deserve 😘
Is it wrong that I want you guys to get that house?
*thank you* 🥺💔  *my boyfriend just passed away on Sunday and this was a beautiful escape* 😖🥺💔  *I am so happy for you guys* 💛  *you and Morgan make life a little more bearable* 🥺💔💛
I seriously hope you guys get that house and move there. I think you'll all be so happy. And I'm sooooo happy to see Shane!
i love this so much that i wish i could like it 100 times! can i live in your barn :) i loved seeing shane so happy and excited also!!!
There's a little private place for Shane's mom to come visit or even move there I think it's perfect
I LOVE this for you two.....Seriously. Chills the whole time. I feel like it would be easier to fly Shane's mom out to see you guys (and more convenient) than it is right now with your whole family having to come to Cali. to see you guys. It just feels happy, and safe, and loving and JUST what is needed right now. (from an outsiders point of view) Love you all- and hope everything works out the way it should.  <3
I was in a lowkey kind of shitty mood but seeing everyone so excited about the house and just the fact they are all happy made me happy
I really hope that Ryland and Shane realize what they are getting themselves into and what all comes with country living. I get that it looks a lot more upscale country but it's still rural and and there are pro's and con's that come with it. I seriously hope that if they decide to get horses that they do a LOT of research before commiting to that.
Beautiful house!! 💜
WHAT??? Ryland how can you do this to us??? Are you guys moving????? Also I think your parents living with you guys would be amazing!! My husband and I now live with my son in law and daughter and two granddaughters and we absolutely love it!! Life is short and at the end of the day there is nothing more important than family!!! ❤️
Whoa this is HD 😂❤️
GET THE FUCKING HOUSE FUCK LA YOU GUYS WILL THRIVE IN COLORADO IT WILL BE THE BEST DECISION OF YOUR LIVES IMMSOHAPPY FOR YOU GUYS I SWEAR TO GOD BUY THIS HOUSE
HOLY MOLY I LOVE THIS HOUSE!! YOU GUYS GOTTA JUMP ON THAT BEFORE ITS GONE!!!
This house is stunning!!! I would jump at that opportunity
The cliffhanger is killing meee
You would be stupid not to move there what is keeping you in la apart from nothing go live you life!!!!!
The house is beautiful, I hope y'all get it 💙💙💙
Because the price is so low in comparison to their LA house, they could just build a pool if they wanted.
Leaving la was the best thing I ever did now I have 23 acres a paid off home and my son has the best place to grow up
But what about Shane's mom, or Andrew...or the sip podcast?
This house is amazing
if they don’t get the house i’m going to be so mad
As someone who has been dying to get a house in Denver. Omg Ryan I hope you get the house! It looks perfect.
Aww i wish part 3 was coming today LOL
This home belongs in better homes and gardens and to be loved by you guys. So pretty
If you get this house please bring back conspiracy content in the home office!
If you guys move to Colorado can I please come visit?! Cause my brother already lives there.. so we can all hang! 🤣🥰 that house is a dream house for sure, though! ❤❤
hate how everything is cut up into 20 minute videos, you used to have like 30,40 minute videos this just feels like you’re cutting it to get more watch time out of ys
I love this so much , just seems right !
Absolutely 0 hate but I’m getting strong live laugh love vibes
How dare you cliffhanger us like that
Omg GORGEOUS HOME
I'm not crying...  But, what about mumma Dawson? Nvm, she can have the barn apartment ;-;
P.S. I live in San Diego and I will gladly say how toxic Southern California is!
It just makes me sad because the pod. I love it and i love lizze. It would be sad for it to be over
So the podcast will be shot in the barn? ❤️❤️❤️ the house.  Love you both.
i think moving out of LA would benefit you both so much!!
I seriously have chills from that home. It just seems so right!
This house and the land its on is so beautiful 😍 reminds me of my home here in Michigan. I love Colorado for you guys! Best of luck in whatever decision you make!
Yes yes yes!! It’s perfectly beautiful!! Looks so peaceful 🥺💗
I couldn’t think Ryan is more annoying why was this suggested to me
I'm crying inn broke 😫🤣 do it! Buy it! You'll love it!
This is MY DREAM HOUSE!! I’ve always imagined living on a hill , with acres upon acres. 🙏🏼🥺🥰😍 #coloradoliving
This house is everything just like when Morgan said we are gonna have matching tractors! I'm in love with this house omg. All my love from Michigan ❤️
Wanna buy me a house lol
I hope and pray this home will be yours 🏡 it’s easy to see just how beneficial it would be for the both of you in so many ways, especially for Shane, his mental health will thank him for it 🍃 #Flourishing 🤍
If you don't buy this house I will be so disappointed. This house gave ME bubble guts! It screamed your names. I swear it's meant for you guys. I'd choose that house over your LA house 10 million times.   LA is so overrated, I think you would be so much happier in CO.
Buy it! I love it
I LOVE IT!  Screw LA.  Sell the old house and move to Colorado.   Or you could buy something smaller in LA.
This is your house
ryland there’s a big arabian horseshow in denver next month!
So exciting! Beautiful house! I hope you get it. I think you would be happy in CO.
I just love your dad! He’s like the dream dad! Uber supportive and quiet 😃
At the end of the vlog with the preview of the next video I was literally tearing up with joy & excitement for them at this possibility. 🤞
They didn't get it. It was all over Ryland's face....
jelly, you got a horse barn
GET THE HOUSE! Get the house ! Get the house ! Get the house ! Get the house ! 👌🏻😏👏👏👏👏
If they don’t get this house I’ll be so sad for them! What a cliffhanger!
That house?!?😍😍 I’m literally in love with it!❤️❤️
I can literally picture the wedding here with the family!
Good for you guys. I hope it’s a breath of fresh air and you enjoy every well deserved  moment
That house is beautiful.
This house is perfect for you both I really hope you get it 🥺
That house is beautiful… I do think getting out of LA would be good for both of you
Ahhhhh that house is literally everything.
How dare you leave us on such a cliff hanger!! That’s Some real abc kind of shit 😅. I’m going to need that part 2 like yesterday please!!!!
Clearly they bought it because they cant show the footage unless they own it. But im so excited for them that place looks amazing. Im also curious because i really cant tell were thier house is and i lived in the same area as  Rylands parents. So i wanna know where that is cuz I WANNA LIVE THERE!
Oh my gosh if you get this house, you should get married in that gorgeous back yard!
Omg im right there with mom i wanna move in too🥺
shanes mom better live in the barn!!!!! lol
This seems like the perfect place for you both, and all of your fur babies.  A place to be, with space to grow and be happy with loving supportive family close by. I hope you buy it. Plus...I'm loving seeing more Shane content too.
why does the ending seem like they aren’t gonna get it ryland looks sad
am i alone in being ecstatic when  "dad" tore his hat off and said "at least i'm the democrat?"  (*wish my dad was a democrat..*)
This is absolutely heart warming. I feel so much family love in this video. Family is everything.
this is the prettiest house i’ve ever seen 😭😭😭
I would watch every second of you two at this house.  I will cry if your offer doesn't go through!  Omg.  Thanks for sharing this with us!   I love the house and property!
This house is my dream house! So beautiful.
Omg I love thissss!!!! A perfect home for settling down 🥺😍❤️
I love that house! That's perfect land for ducks.
OMG!!!! Did you get the house!!! I can’t stand the suspense.
Omg this is so exciting. My husband and I just moved from Los Angeles to Georgia and we LOVE it.
Jesus is King repent Hes coming back so so soon
I wonder why we never see Shane's family in the way they spend so much time with Ryland and Morgans?
I think you both should do it get away from the chaotic hustle and bustle of the big city and be at peace and enjoy the surroundings of country life. Colorado is a BEAUTIFUL PLACE to live I love Colorado 👌❤️
I’m so obsessed with you and Shane! You guys make me so happy when I watch your videos! I LOVE watching your whole family and how your parents an Shane seem pretty close! YOU ALL ARE AMAZING!💜💜
I feel like this would be such a healthy move for you spiritually. The excitement shown by both of you is magical. Sending you all the luck if you decide to get it. It's phenomenal.
this is literally my DREAM!! Also I seen a tiktok to manifest seeing a flamingo within 2 days and HERES THE FLAMINGO IN THE VIDEO!!! I took it as a sign to say everything is going the way it is intended... get that house! Half the price too you could literally get 2 and buy one for Teresa 🥰🥰🥰
I soooo wanna see Ryland’s dad teaching Shane how to fish…
Ahhh I need to see the next video already! You have to get this house!
I love the house buy it buy it buy it buy it
I hope you got the house!  There’s nothing like being surrounded by a close and loving family. I’m with Grandma, I’d buy it if I could.
BRUH THIS HOUSE IF MY IDEAL HOUSE ESPECIALLY THE BASEMENT
Despite all the drama around Shane and everything, and me still not knowing exactly how to feel about it all, seeing these videos truly make me hope that they are well and happy. No one deserves to be hated so harshly and I’m glad they are getting through that rough patch ❤️
omg this vid made me cry
Omg next vlog plz need to see 👌😭
I loved  every minute of this 😍  love and  best wishes from Canada 🇨🇦 xo
I low key want that house
Oh my gosh. Why am I crying? Lol. This house is meant to be yours. YOU NEED THIS HOUSE ❤️ Sending so many good vibes, prayers and love to you all. It’s perfect.
GRANDMA!
Also, what will happen to the podcast if they move?😔❤
On one hand I'm so happy that they're happy, but while I don't know the current state of their relationship, I'm sad because I know if they move to Colarado we probably won't be getting the old Shane, Ryland, Andrew, Garret, and Morgan videos.😭 Still so happy for them though.
You're killing me smalls. These cliffhanger.
I think this house was made for you guys, I know it would be a hard move but I think it’ll be worth it. I think you both need a change!! It’s absolutely perfect and fits what you guys have planned for your future! YOU COULD ALSO HAVE CHICKENS!!
Oh my gosh!! Ryland, shane… you guys should totally get this house!!
Move move move !!
Okay not to be dramatic or anything, but I full on sobbed thinking of you guys raising a family here. I’m not trying to put any pressure on y’all but I’ve been subbed to Shane since probably 2009/2010 and just to see where he’s been and this is where he could end up? Surrounded in a small, close, loving family in a peaceful farmhouse away from the madness that is LA makes my heart so so so happy for you guys.  You guys deserve this peace, happiness, STABILITY, and love. My heart is so full and I can’t stop LITERALLY SOBBING while y’all are touring this place. I just feel like THIS is it.  All my love! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The office def gives me ♤conspiracy♤ vibes shane
I don't care if you move to Colorado. I don't care if you stay in California. I don't care if you keep a place in both and go back and forth. All I want is for you both to be utterly and completely happy, wherever you are. Love and good vibes to you both from Chicago, and big wishes for clarity while choosing which option is the perfect one for you two.🌞⛰️🦄🐷❤️
Omg. This house. Is beyond words. I can see you both raising your family there. Big Christmas gatherings, Halloween parties, winter/summer fun!!!?  It has everything and more. As for LA .....sad to leave but smile cuz it happened. You both deserve a fresh start in a dream home. Being surrounded by nature like this will do WONDERS for mental health. AHHH I can’t wait for the next video. What a cliffhanger !?!!!! Luv luv luvvvvvv u both🥰
If someone else outbid you I hope they step on a lego
How great is Ryland's dad he got so excited make this move. Make moms day, month, year xxxx
So happy for use...its peaceful n beautiful xx
The more I watch Ryland the more I question how him and Shane fit together lol. Don't get me wrong I love them both, and started out as a Shane fan. They just have such different personalities.
You guys should definitely move to the Colorado house !
Ok I'm crying. They need this.
Stop I’m literally crying. You guys deserve this so much. I really hope you and Shane both decide to move there. I know it would be a huge change, but I feel like it’s best to get away from California and all the toxicity of it. I’m excited to see what happens next with you guys!💗
Dude tell your dad to wear his seat belt.  My anxiety
Get ittttttt!!!!!!!!!
I’m here for this!!!!!
This is the best house I have seen on YouTube home tour get it please  💜
Will Shane’s mom move with you guys if you move ?!
I really hope you and Shane do fine a great house in Colorado, I think it'd be great for you and Shane! And your whole family! Love this vlog
Seeing Shane this excited makes me smile! What a beautiful property!
I love this house! It is beautiful
I got such a kick out of shane getting excited about the llamas and horses😂 “PONIES!”
I love seeing Shane, Shane I love you, and it was so good to see you.  I think it's time to have a new beginning, the house is so beautiful!  It would be so nice to be close to Ryland's family.   Please keep us posted, love ya!   It even has a zipline! That is so cool!
Why is no one talking about rylands dad bonding with Shane over fish I’m just 😭😭😭😭
Ryland and Morgan’s dad is literally my favorite human on the planet.
Buy it already. That is beautiful!!!
Oh wow it’s gorgeous inside!
Oh lord that house is absolutely beautiful! You gotta get it
I think Shane and ryland should totally move to Colorado! And bring Shane’s mom!
please don't make us wait too long for the next video!! I hope you get the house!
That house is gorgeous! It has everything you could ever want. 😍
That was so special, the house is meant to be😍 You both deserve to be happy! Loved seeing Shane, can't wait for him to come back❤
Can I live in the barn upstairs? I'll pay rent 😉 LOL yeah i know I can only wish
Happy for you guys Colorado is awesome!
Rylands dad is a fucking king
Morgan, just tell him you'll have his baby if he moves to CO.
"maybe Postmates is just harder to get?"  Shane's iconic line of the year 🤣🤣
THAT ENDING THOUGH... hello cliff hanger! Lol
Plz plz plz move here it's time move away and be happy. Family is everything and your family will always be the ones who are there for u both. Just Shane's mom too move to and there is ur happily ever after. Good luck xxx
When shane said quietly to himself, I want to live here, I want to live here, got me right in the feels
To New Beginnings.... 🥂💖🌱 (To health, hospitality & happiness! Wishing y'all nothing but positive energy on your new journey! I'm so excited for you guys, make the best of it😉💖)
So who else totally bets that they already bought this house!?
And also, 🖕🏻 L.A.!!!
Ah, I genuinely hope they get this house.  It feels so perfect for them, and I definitely think leaving the toxicity of LA behind is a perfect move.
I have so much house envy right now! I hope to see you guys move out of toxic LA. ♥️
Shane actually being excited made me excited lol. I hope you guys decide to actually move and be with Rylands family!
@18:28 & like a minute or 2 after 🥺 the happiness on everyone’s face
Beautiful property!!! Omg!! PERFECT FOR YOU GUYS!!!!!!! 💙🙏🏻
I love it so soooooo much !!!!
What a beautiful house! I hope you and Shane buy it! I wish you both all the happiness in the world!❤️❤️❤️
That’s so exciting! Is to chop wood lol 😂
I Love this so much!!!
I think this house would be the best move!
Obviously I don’t know you guys personally, but this house seems like the perfect fit for you. It’s unreal 💖 p.S love seeing you Shane!!
It’s so weird seeing new Shane content after everything that happened
please move there and bring shane's mom lol
AND?? and wat damn it
THINK OF THE CONENT 😭😭
Shane! Shane! Shane! I need Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaane. Love you guys!
Did they secretly get married? Rylands new ring
I have a feeling the house was sold before they made an offer
Shane's energy in this video makes me so happy. The house is beautiful!
I love how excited Ryland and Morgan’s dad gets 😭😭😭
Idk why I’m getting so emotional for them! I’m legit crying! Happy tears tho🥺
Omg this is so sweet!! And you can do a series on your channel on decorating the house! That will def help pay for it lol
SO happy to see Shane included ♥️
First- HII GRANDMA!!! Omg I love her so much - she reminds me of my mommom and lord I miss her so much! So seeing her warms my heart! Thanks grandma ❤️  I WISH YOU AND SHANE ALL THE BEST!! The home is beautiful and it would fit ur family well!! Blessings and beauty to you! Thanks for making me smile tonight - definitely needed it! What ever you do may it be amazing! -Get the housssseeee 😂-it was made for you 2 lol
Omg this house is gorgeous! Sending positive vibes ryland and shane! I hope its you're everything and you get it!
Oh My God!! That house is FABULOUS …. I can’t believe I have to wait till next vlog to see what you guys are gonna do. ❤️❤️❤️
Spoiler alert they got it!
ANDDD…..????? 😭 please dot disappoint me
Shane asking Rylands dad “did they build it good?” Was the most precious moment 🥺😭
Buy this and have a backyard wedding! It’s beautiful!!!!!
Omg so beautiful…I would do it in a heart beat if I were you two. How fun 🤩 I’m crying! Hahaha I’m a mess, for you guys. It’s FATE guys!
I hope you two get the house ❤️
I absolutely love this house it looks so peaceful and I feel like that’s what they need, privacy and peacefulness! Plus the place is gorgeous
That house is gorgeous. I love the way Shane was talking to Ryland‘s dad about the house so cute!
Omg, omg, omg!
Shane can get a potbelly pig  🐷
I swear I'm gonna comment on every video and beg for MORE SHANE!! It's SO good to see him!! I want more I've missed you so much!!❤
I LOVE seeing all my fav youtubers leave LA. It’s so toxic there. I feel like during the pandemic people realized what really matters and what they actually want. Also this house is SO gorgeous. Ok even that RUG in the office reminds me of Shane’s conspiracy shirt! And that’s the basement door Ryland mentioned in Morgan’s vid. Omg you guys could get married in your backyard there 🥺🥺
Shane doesn't care about his mom only rylan's family and his family
LOL @ "we're going to have matching tractors!"
Leaving it on a cliffhanger like that?!?! Ugh!!! Im crying for you guys!!! I really hope you guys move and be close to your family! Teresa can live in the little apartment! Shane looks so happy there... I can't wait for the next vlog!!!! Post it soon please!!!
I'm getting a mix between the old house and newer house in this house. I love it🖤🖤🖤
I literally started crying when the deer walked across the hill. Whenever life gets hard I start to look for the deer and when I see them I know everything is going to be okay. They say that deer are a sign of good luck, good omens and that your spirit guides are watching over you. I even went as far as getting a tattoo of deer hoof prints to remind myself.   Whatever happens with your offer on this house know that you’re on the right path and that the universe is directing you where you’re supposed to be.   I wish nothing but amazing things for you both.
Hey ryland I watch to your podcast this morning from yesterday it was awesome work
Get it get it get it! Please
I’m in loveeee with this house! 😍😍
Yesss I’m here for you’s to move!
I cant even begin to explain the positive energy I feel coming for all of you. Im in tears so excited for you guys. I feel moving away from LA will dramatically impact your lives for the best.
The house is beautiful!!omg!!I'm so excited that u put a offer... 🤞
Guys chill they dont get a house
This would be great. Shane would get healthy and lose weight and spiritually grow. Get out of LA and start this new journey!
i really hope you get this house!!!
I definitely feel like you guys got the house otherwise I bet you wouldn’t have made the video! But I am soooo excited for you guys!
So beautiful..happy for yall ❤
I've never caught so many feels from a house tour Before! So exciting and their faces says it all... They look so captivated! Yay!
Bye it. Love it. Love hearing Shane so giddy. Totally see Ryland doing yoga in the yard. Bye and get married already.
Oh I am so damn excited…you need to get your ass to Colorado and bring Shane’s mom or at least make up a room for whenever she comes.. I am so happy to see Shane again. That house and the sitting is so freaking awesome!! Do it do it do it…
Ryland!!!  I can not with you right now!  You seriously cut it off there??! Ugh!  I have been in tears since half way thru the video. Happy tears. Please say you got it! Pppppplease!
Shane:  Oh my god, ponies! Oh my god, Christmas trees! They have nick-naks!  He's so precious 🥺💖
That is a great house! Get it! Get it! Get it!
I’m so happy for you guys! You should be close to family, I think it’s a beautiful opportunity for growth and change.
Congratulations 🎉 you guys deserve it.
Nice
Ughhh the cliff hanger!
I love farm houses!
I need the next VLOG LIKE NOWWWW!!! soooo beautiful 🤩🤩🤩🤩
This video made me so happy 💖  When Morgan says about the robes being a sign!  I thought the Knick knacks was the sign 💖   You can just tell how happy the both of you are with this house!! Ugh love that for you!!
I’ve been waiting for this!!! Yay!
Get out of toxic LA, get your mum a granny flat on the property.
Omg I hope you guys get the house! 🤞🤞💜💖❣️🧡💙💙💚💛💛❤️🤍🤎💓💗💗💞💕❣️💘💝💖❤️❤️💛💚💙🧡💜💕💕
Ohhhh I love this for you guys. And so happy thinking about future family ❤️
That property is 10x better holyyyyy
I love hearing Shane get more and more sure of wanting to live there. At first there was question in his tone but by the end you could tell he really wants it
THIS HOUSE WAS MEANT FOR YALL ARE U KIDDING
I JUST WANT TO KNOW! This all made me cry. Shane seemed so happy.
I love Ryland’s dad ❤️
REBIRTH!!!
Oh my gosh! You guys have to move back here! This is your home! You have to buy this house. Get married in the back yard! 🥰
wait...does it feel haunted at all??
I love this! Can I move into the loft above the barn 😂
YES! Ryland and Shane go for it! Gorgeous house! I wish I could afford to buy it.
So happy for you both!! Fabulous home!!!!! I hope they take your offer!!
Omg Ryland that house is soooo beautiful 😱😱😱 it is sooo you guys I hope this will be your 2nd home 🏡 fingers crossed 🤞
You need this house. You need to get married at this house. The happiness was just radiating off of all of you while being in it! I hope you get it, but I really hope you just do whatever is best for the both of you 💕
Yay Shane ❤️❤️❤️
I hope they get it….. I’m pretty sure they already did. 🙏🏽
😩😭😭😭 You have to get it!!! This is for you! ❤️❤️
Okay but on some real shit you guys NEED that house.
I'd buy this house. I hope you guys move here and start your family x
BRING TERESA YAW WITH YOU
🥺❤️ Literally goals. This house couldn’t be more you guys , every detail. Ryland can have his horses , it’s perfect. DO IT!! YOU CAN GET MARRIED THERE🙌🏻🙌🏻
Shane you don’t get to keep the knick knacks😂
You'd be crazy NOT to buy this beautiful and spacious home!!!
You guys should definitely move there, LA is toxic
I love Ryland's mom so much
New Home New Shane and maybe his comeback to YouTube.
I would say goodbye California! Hello Colorado!!!
This is definitely the turning point you guys both need!
Omg that’s such beautiful house I really hope you guys get it 😫
So like if y’all buy this house can I um move into the guest apartment above the barn? Lol 🥺😂
YouTube needs a LOVE button
California: golf cart Colorado: QUAD Can I live in your new barn?
Absolutely GORGEOUS HOUSEEEE it would be great to move close to family and change up your life a bit!!! Seems like everyone is so happy with this house even I love it!
Omg...i could feel Shane's energy...pure happiness at that house. I think the best thing you guys could do for your mental health is GET OUT OF LA! fingers crossed you got the house❤❤❤
That house is an amusement park
your home in LA is gorgeous but this is definatleya family home, its beautiful
Omg it's pure perfection! But, ending the vlog there though lol. Good luck 🤞 that place is just the dream forever home xo
I’m so excited for you two coming along way yes small rooms but more land to be comfortable and building on to it that’s so exciting
Fingers crossed 🤞🏻
Love this!! Love the music too! Fits the vibe and feels like a wholesome country sitcom 😂🥰
Hopefully they get this house and also it they’re forever home
I love this so much more then the LA house! I’d miss the pool but the lake and hot tub would make it worth it. It’s so much more homey and cozy!
This house is like MADE FOR YOU TWO 😩💕
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. Don’t get horses until you have at least been trained at a barn for close to a year. Trust me it’s the way to go. Because they are not some dog. They can kill you. So pls be careful and learn for a while
I’ve been waiting for this video! I’m so happy for you guys, you can just hear the sigh of relief that the house gives you guys and the comfort. I was tearing up at the end of the video when you said you put in a offer. You both deserve so much happiness and I can’t wait to see where this takes you. Now I’m going to be clutching my phone waiting for the 3rd video 😍🥰
That house is a dream!
You guys need to move out of La I think it is going to help both of your anxieties so much it's going to be a healthy decision
Ryland with the ultimate cliffhanger had me feeling like Ross from “Friends.” wondering if Rachel got off the plane
I’m so happy for you guys, I hope this works out for you! I could’ve cried watching this and hearing Shane’s happiness. You guys deserve this!!!
yep, that house is perfect in just about every way
Are you kidding me???? YOU GUYS IF YOU DONT GET IT THEN I WILL !! (jk) but It’s absolutely beautiful:) I wish a good restart for you Ryland, and Shane. You deserve to be happy and free after a rough years of internet negativity. Sounds cheesy, but it’s the beginning of a new chapter. Sending love to both of you xx
now this is the type of house I'd buy and have mountains around it. I really do hope they get the house, it's perfect for them!
That’s a real home 🏡 I love it
I hope you guys get the house! Absolutely stunning and perfect!
I don’t think they got it
It has Shane Dawson
This house has happy memories. Happy ass energy.
Moving to another place when you feel some responsibility to a parent you adore, I could see the ambivalence. I do think Shane’s mom could move there to help her own sense of self too. I can only imagine how this stuff has impacted her, let alone you two. You all deserve a fresh start.
Oh my gosh! Goosebumps!!!! This is so perfect for you guys!!!
All that beautiful house is missing is a ton of animals and a pool
This gives me vibes of their old house. I love it.
Sell the LA house and live in this house forever!
I’m obsessed with rylands dad being soooo supportive
I love how happy Shane is. It really means so much to see him happy. I hope you guys get the house. The house is nice but that yard is even better.
I kinda want them to move away from LA. It's such a toxic place for them, I feel like Colarado is much more peaceful for them and they get to be surrounded by people who support them
People that live next to me have a bus with your name on it ? Please tell me why
I just gotta say I love how shane fits in with rylans family perfect.its meant to be 100%
I really want Shane to come back to YouTube
All I needed to hear was someone had bubble guts. You guys are gonna live here and we’re gonna have episodes of The Sip from the basement 🥺 PLS
AHH. I see  more videos for Shane and Ryland!
This is such a beautiful home you guysss 🥺❤️
I feel like moving out of LA will do wonders for your mental health. I hope you get the house! It's so beautiful.
I had this big smile during the entire video, so happy to see you and your family happy like that ❤️ hope you will take this home she’s a dream  Bisous de la France 🇫🇷
Is Shane’s mom going to move to and live in the apartment above the barn?
Hope you get it! Looks like a dream and a new chapter for you all!!
I love how Shane points the camera at Ryland asking who they are meeting and Morgan is like OK SO. This just turned into Morgan’s vlog
I’m actually shocked at how perfect this house is for you two. It’s literally like it was made for you guys.
You should get married at your (New Place)
I hope u guys get it, it's so beautiful
I love the countryside! It’s all I’ve ever known and I wouldn’t ever wanna live in the city just because of how peaceful the countryside is! That’s literally my dream house and land!
Crying happy tears, this is going to be such a good move for you guys! Was smiling ear to ear the whole vlog! ❤️❤️
I just loveeeeee cliffhangers 🥲
I NEED you to move into this house!!!  If I can't have it I need you guys to be the ones to live there! I am in love with this place.
To funny dad busted her LOL
*I'm actually crying right now, it's so cute to see both of you be happy and excited*
How would we feel about a Shane Ryland,and Morgan Farm life pod cast?
So excited for ya'll love you
Buy it
I have followed Shane for 8+ years and seeing him grow, this house is honestly the move. Plus loved his reactions to the knickknacks 😂 Love you both!
Y’all should so get the hell out of L.A. and move to this Glorious Place!! ♥️
Would shane's mom go colorado too
I moved to Denver from California about 2 months ago, and it was the best decision I’ve ever made!
Wow that house is so amazing. I think the move would be great for you two being surrounded by family is the best feeling especially when raising a little one. Good luck 🤞
I’m sending every good vibes that I possibly can to y’all to get that house ❤️❤️❤️
the peacefulness and the beautiful aura surrounding that home was beautiful.
this is my actual Colorado dream house, it is STUNNNNING! Wow! Fingers crossed and all the positive vibes that you guys get this house!!🤍
Always like animal hauls ❤️
I love this you guys deserve to be happy! Love you guys and like forreal it’s like this house was made for y’all !!😍
Love it! To new beginnings! You BOTH deserve it!!!
I got the chills even looking at this house. I know this is the next adventure for you guys. Xoxoxo 555
❤️
The intro just makes me want to party every single time
I can’t wait to watch Shane learn how to fish!!
0:42 Honey went “Oop I’m in the shot!”
I felt as though in the beginning Ryland was excited and Shane was doubting it. Then it felt while the house tour was going on Ryland looked a bit down or doubtful himself where as Shane sounded excited… Ultimately in the end it’s your guy’s life and can live and love how you want! :D
✨very exciting!✨I hope you call it home..it’s beautiful! ⭐️
From the way Ryland is talking it looks like the offer was refused 🥺
This house is BEAUTIFUL! It has you and Shane written all over it! You NEED to get married here, also the barn house is perfect for Shane's Mum! ❤
Love it! Hope you got it. Imagine all the new content opportunities! Bring Shane's mum with!
Omg omg I’m obsessed 🤩
Thank you guys for sharing with us even though it may affect your privacy.. I pray if you guys move here all fans respect you and not show up
I think it would be really great for you guys to get a fresh start outside of LA. I think you both would be much happier and less stressed. Either way I’m rooting for you guys and will always support y’all no matter what you choose to do! 💗
Your house in LA is amazing but wow this one is everything!!!
Beautiful house, and Colorado seems so much better than California.
Leave the country
This house is amazing you guys should get it it is my dream home I’m sure it’s everyone’s dream home you guys deserve it I can’t wait to see what you guys do here.
While it may not be this house, you need to get out of California, and move closer to your family.  You're so lucky that you have a great relationship with the whole family, and they accept Shane as theirs also.  I agree that you don't want to raise your family in the LA area. It just seems so toxic and shallow.  DO IT!!!!
What's crazy is a house like that in california would be close to 1million, but it's more affordable there. I'd say hell yea buy it. The only that ng it's kissing is a pool.
So happy for you guys, I hope it works out! Lovely home!! Xo love seeing shane back in the vlogs too!!
Ryland, great vlog! How could you leave us hanging!!!!
It’s a beautiful home I think this would be a nice peaceful place for Shane
I spent the entirety of this video sending clips to my friend to show her how Shane and I are legit the same person lmao sooo excited for you both!!
Absolutely stunning home, a fresh start,  family OMG do it. You are so worth it
Can we meet Brad?
Ryland are you KIDDING ME. That ending 😫
I like the other house better
So excited for your new home and new adventures
You guys NEED this house 😭… I can so picture you with two Adirondack chairs sitting by the pond drinking Diet Coke 🤧
I hope they get it because it would be so good for them mentally and physically and best of all  they'd be away from LA!
You guys should start with ducks or chickens or even both. See how taking care of them goes for 6 months to a year, then if you really are down for the hard work, get a horse but it’s so different and much more work. Just similar with the stinky poop and high matience
It is so you. 💖
I feel like Shane’s mom is never involved in your big life events anymore 🥺
All the feels. And I hopped off the Shane train years ago. But hey people change. I'm fully back on the Shane train. I wanted to cry. Might go buy some merch. I'm having a Shane salvation moment. Pass the plate. Forgive us all for things we've done wrong Lord and help us all to grow and become better people. Shane I'm sincerely sorry that I judged you as harshly as I did. You are such a sweet soul.  💗
Why’d this vlog make me teary-eyed 🥺 You can’t pass up an opportunity like that house…especially with how the housing market is right now
I am so excited to see your new adventure!!!!
Do it life change is needed LA is so last year its Perfect
In the purchase agreement they need to leave Slim Skeleton!
Im gonna cry i want it
The house is gorgeous.
The house is just soo so gorgeous holy
This vlog is filled with so much love and so many good vibes. Thank you for always providing us with wholesome content that lifts our hearts 💖
Wow I can for sure seeing you guys raise your babies and animal babies here I really do hope you guys get it honestly it’s beautiful and it would be better for all you guys too be close together and stuff and ughhhhh 🥰❤️ please get ittttt ❤️❤️
Omg I’m crying🥲
This house honestly does give me Shane and Ryland vibes!!!! Yes, I think u all should buy it and stay here half the year!!!! Its perfect!!!
The little Knick knacks is a total sign! Firm believer in that ✨feeling✨ you get when you first see it. Hope you guys get it!
I think their offer might have gotten rejected.
I have goosebumps from watching this and seeing how happy you all are!!
I really hope you both end up getting it! You guys look so happy there and it gives me happy tears!
I am not even the one getting the house but seeing how beautiful it is and seeing how happy you guys were and your family made me honestly filled with pure joy! I really hope you guys get this house. ❤❤❤
This house is so SHALAND. I really hope y’all buy it. Can’t wait to find out if y’all get it.
Why am I emotional😭 so happy for you guys 💕 When I saw the guest house in the barn I genuinely cried. I can’t afford/ provide a home for me and my son and there’s just a spare apartment in this random barn in someone’s house bigger than what we have. Perspective. You’ve worked so hard for where you are in life and it’s so Inspirational! I need to find something I thrive in and grow in and work harder to get to a point I want to be at for me and my son. If you want things to change you have to change yourself. Seeing This house is motivation!! X
Omg it’s so exciting! 🤗🧚‍♀️
Ugh it’s so beautiful!!
If you don’t buy it I will!! Omg love this for you guys.
Can I move in too🤣🤣It is beautiful.
He seemed kinda sad at the end of the video so guessing they didn't get it
The Way this Video has Just Inspired me Even More!!!! Little did Little Shane Know How Beautiful His Life Would End up ❤️ It’s Never Too Late! Don’t give up on your Dreams 🙌🏽
So u should definitely buy it and u should let me live with u😂
It’s GORGEOUS  Yous haaaaave to buy it! Congrats guys, I couldn’t afford to RENT somewhere new 😅
Uh, no sir! Do not leaving me hanging like that!! This place is stunning!! Just think about Christmas time there! Magical! And all the fall and Halloween decor...I can’t even.
Even if you don't get the house, you guys should move. You seem much more happy outside of L.A.
Can y'all bring Mama Teresa with you and give her the barn guesthouse!
This already feels like a better vibe than your current house.
They have knick-knacks 😂
What a stunning home
This made me soo happy. I hope its what you want and you get it. Its beautiful!! Amazing ♡
Anyone else crying? This was such a wonderful video! I hope you guys get it
I love the house so much!! I hope you guys get that house or something similar like that some day!! 💕🏡🥰
It’s beautiful holy shot
That place is so beautiful wow, the only thing is I can't imagine them not in LA anymore, Shane probably can't even order his daily Postmates in that farm haha and his mom would be left behind in la 😔

The house is stunning and have so much space outside and they need peace and quite and to enjoy life and maybe the ghost stays in the old house lol

Kris Jenner with the cowboy hat hahaha
Ryland looks like the agent with his papers xddd
That house is amazing. Dream home for sure
Why am I crying.This clog was so amazing.God I hope you get this house.When I heard Shane say he got bubble guts my heart filled with joy.
This is my dream home I’m so hopeful that you’ll get this home. I’m so happy to see Shane smiling and hopeful. Been with him for so many years I’ll be forever proud and happy for his happiness and growth.
Beautiful area ! And trust me you guys don’t need horses yet.. they’re a HUGE commitment
Rylands dad pointing out the sledding hills and saying how well built the house is is iconic
omg I want this so much for you guys !!!! y'all deserve it !!!
This made me tear up! I can't wait to see Shane happy (obviously you too Ryland) but Shane NEEDS out of LA.
If I could I would definitely buy the house
I feel so invested in you guys moving  to Colorado for no real reason other than I LOVE Ryland’s family and watching you all together.
So so SOOOOO happy to see Shane!!!! That house is gorgeous!!!! They'd be crazy not to get it!!!
YES GET THE HOUSE ITS BEAUTIFUL
Get the house!!!! OMG 😱😱😱😱❤
Morgan - "I wanna pop six of my own I don't think I can do seven" Dad - "What?" 🤣 I swear that part got me 🤣
I LOVED the video. You both looked genuinely happy and everyone was excited for you both. I hope your offer was accepted. It’s a beautiful and tranquil home. As someone who is 28 and just bought a house and has has been watching Shane’s videos since High school, it made me happy to see Shane and how happy he was in the video. Fingers crossed for you guys!!!
I hope u guys do get it! New beginnings!
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG   I FUCKING LIIIIIIIIIIVVVVE FOR THESE TYPE OF BLOGS....😭😭😭😭😭 I MISS YOU ALL SO FUCKING MUCH....PLEASE COME BACK TO COLORADO. MY FAN OF AN ASS IS already living here in Lone Tree lol I'm currently looking for Houses that are also farm style houses. Maybe we'll be neighbours 🤣🤣🤣 highly doubt it...but a gal can dream 🤣👏🏽🤣👏🏽🤣👏🏽❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Gosh I didn’t realise how much I missed Shane! You brighten my day 🤗 wishing you both the most blessed happy future together, I could tell you were both in love with that house! Xx
What a dream home! It is perfect! I can see you both there and so happy.  💜
kay bitches i just bursted crying. f* LA. just move.
It seems to me that the older you get the positive vibe you want and this place has a good vibe in it. I have to say though, I am not from LA. I'm from Hawai'i and I don't really know much about the mainland. But this house says everything for Ryland and Shane. Hope they get it and start something fresh and awesome.
So happy for you guys!!!!!!
This house is actually beautiful 😭❤️ I hope they move their permanently or just buy it anyway
Morgan “we’re gonna have matching tractors” 🚜 😂  Edit: that cliffhanger 😖 😆
a beautiful house! and its the best living near family who u get along with very well!
I feel like this is what Shane needs !
Congrats on them accepting your offer! So exciting :)
Ok upload the next one plz 😁
Sell the la house! Get rid of that place and move on with your lives! La is toxic!
If y’all don’t get this house!!! It’s made for you 🤍🤍 a dream
I love all of this. I have a warm feeling in my heart for you two. This is definitely a great step forward for you guys!
BEAUTIFUL HOUSE.  HOPE THEY GET IT. LOVE LOVE SEEING SHANE MORE. <3 LOVED THE WHOLE FAMILY VIBE.  SUCH A BLESSING. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT.  HUGS TO ALL.
LA is lame move on to bigger and better things
Shane is so happy and it makes me so happy. He deserves to be happy.
Great vlogs can be filmed in Colorado! We’re living for Ryan and Shane family vlogs!
Wow!
That is a dream house! I hope souch that you guys get it! The best of luck to you!
Omg I’m so happy to see Shane is happy and this house is so exciting and looks so good 😊 you need to move there!!!!!!
Omg I love it 😍😍😍
I need longer videos ryland! 21 minutes wasn't enough! This house is my dream house now😍😍😂 Hope you get it 🙏
I hope they get it
I had goosebumps looking at this house! I would be happy for Ryan and Shane to have the opportunity for a more “normal” quiet life.
I’m loving the Shane and steady content. Living for it. Keep it coming we love you Shane and Ry
buy it!!!!
Get it!!!! It's amazing!
If you dont buy this.. can I have the address so I can?!!?! this is beautiful!!!!
….and??? You really gonna end it like that! Wow!
Are you bringing Teresa with you guys?
Omg where’s part 2!!! 😂😍
What would make this even better is moving Shane’s mom into the guest house, so you’re surrounded by your family. LA is so toxic and I think before you guys officially get married and start a family you should definitely move to Colorado and have a fresh start!
I really do hope yous get this house 🏠 🤞😍 it is absolutely stunning and perfect. To be able to raise your own family here, surrounded by your family will just be amazing, country life is the way to go. I can see yous being so happy. Sending yous and your family lots of love and best wishes ❤❤❤😘👶🐶🐈🐎🐖🐑🐓🐔🐣🐄🐂🦃🦢🦩🐠🌲
Gorgeous house!!!
1/3 God watching this video and seeing Shane is making me cry I miss him so much like hearing him in the back ground and stuff this house is so beautiful it’s making me wanna move to Colorado but that it’ll hand wave in the mirror of Shane just sent me and now I’m crying my makeup of I love all of yall
Omg 😱 you guys this would be the perfect place to get married fr real 🔥 this place is beautiful !! Ryland you worry too much. There were too many signs to not go !! Thank you for sharing this with us 😭 Great video 💖💖💖💯💯💯
It’s OK to say good bye to LA. I think this would be a great for both of you!!🥰
The universe Sent you to that house. How many things in and around that house did you resonate with!? Alot! You two deserve it and if being around Family is what makes you happiest! Then do it! Yolo. LA is overrated! Time to move on to BETTER things! Embrace it
The house and land is beutifull! I think you could both be very happy there, Get away from the chaos that is LA, and just grow together as a family, surrounded by family ❤️
A freaking zipline?! Omg. I really hope they accepted your offer. You both look so happy!!
Ryland- You suck(not really) for leaving us with a cliffhanger..
Idk why but this is giving me very much Reality TV vibes. I’m like eagerly waiting to see what happens. I wanna cry. I want like an hour long video of this type of content. I am manifesting this house for you (if the sale hasn’t already been finalized). My heart was so happy watching this.
Eeeeeeee I'm so excited for y'all 😍 I moved to a mini farm in the sticks this year and got goats and rabbits 😁 I highly recommend it
Stop shaking the camera!
I love the house omg!!! If you guys dont live in it... I surely will!
WOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!! This house is amazing!!! It would cost SO MUCH here in the Seattle area too…just like Cali. I WANT TO BUY A HOUSE THERE!!!!!!!!!!
With that upstairs guest room Shane’s mom could totally just move with them!
I feel bad for Morgan. Ryan copies her and I feel like he stole her thunder for buying her farm house first!!
I am soooo excited for ALL of you 🥰 😭😭🥰😭😭🥰 This is going to be AMAZING!!!!! 😁😁😁
Ugh tell me why I'm crying for you guys. This is so beautiful and sweet. I love this for you both! ❤
Shane  this is  your  place
I love 😍
I think you both deserve it 😍
Literally crying for you guys man you guys really deserve this and everything that comes after ♡ I fucking love you guys!
I love how Dad is so excited for this house, I know you can’t listen to subscribers but I would definitely buy it it’s an amazing place
the casual “oh, at least I’m a democrat”
A message to Shane: please come back. I miss the gem you are so much. You never deserved any of the hate. This video made me cry happy for you both
I just love your dad! I just started the video, but already love! Love you guys!
and what?!?!?!!??
You guys HAVE to get this house!! ♥️♥️♥️
This house is such a good mesh of both Ryland and Shane's style. It's perfect!
I literally cannot wait to see if you guys get the farm 🤍
Love this for you guys!!!! It's a gorgeous property and will bring you both peace.  ❤❤❤ I wish you both nothing but the best!
2:36 *checks hat* “oh at least im a democrat” LMAO
Yeessss , I LOVE that house and cant wait to watch all the videos  that will come from it, it's a new chapter if life, a beautiful  fun chapter I'm so excited  to watch !!!! I feel like we will have the real shane back <3
That house is gorgeous honestly what I wish I could afford :p so happy for you two :3
Why am I freaking crying watching you see this house? 😂 probably because we are house hunting (first time buyers) and can understand your excitement finding such a nice property and home!
We are all invested in this house now guys. I hope your offer was accepted.  We need this house! 😂😜
OMG YAY
and...... ryland be leaving us at a cliffhanger now!!!!!!!!!!1
You need to get this house. It is made for you both. Damn you for the cliffhanger though, you bastard!!!!
Also S/O to the REAL host of the vlog… MORGY 💖🤣 She really stole that show
That place is beyond perfection!!!  I'd chose that over LA hands down!!!!!
Ok 1 what about shanes mom? Then 2 that house was so a set for a movie!!!!!! Ahhhh shane?!
I watched this on .5x speed bcuz it's sucha vibe lol. That kitchen already looks a little similar to the current house but the whole house feels so much more elevated and cohesive. All the little things you could technically change like paint & hardware, is already tailored to Shane's taste.   This feels like the perfect house for Shane to start romanticizing his life and fall in love with himself. He can just enjoy himself & nature in the privacy of his backyard, away from the scrutiny of L.A.  ** last comment after seeing the ending lol; what does L.A even do for y'all anymore? Does it really even serve y'all anymore? It seems like you could be doing the same thing ur doing now, but in a better environment. You could move to this house & be a kid in it yourselves for a few years, you don't have to become a parent as soon as you move, enjoy it awhile. Makes memories sledding and just taking care of some animals maybe :) it really seems like a positive change any way
This house is perfect for you guys!
I would be saying 3 words "bye bye LA" Guys that house is where you lay roots-its so beautiful and you guys do not need to be in LA, you do not need 2 homes-just GO.....it is to perfect!
Omg Shane's little wave I miss him so much
Yay! Welcome to Colorado Shane!
That house looks like a mix between Shane and Ryland…. Like it’s MEANT FOR THEM!!! So beautiful
Hi Ryland 👋,  You really should buy this home 🏡.  I don't say house because a house is a place you live in. A home is a place that lives in you. I really hope you and Shane buy this home. Warm thoughts I send your way Raquel 🙋🏻‍♀️🙈🙉🙊🌬🏡🤸🏻‍♂️🤸‍♂️🐱🐕🐕
I hope you got the house it looks Amazing
I really hope you guys get this house!
*GASP* A part 2?!?!!? The audacity 🥺 I really hope you got it. It’s amazing!!
Shannedeee I’ll take what I can get. I fucking miss you omg
Shane and ryland this house is SOOO YOU GUYS please buy it follow your heart
This house was almost built for you both! It's perfect! I really hope you buy it and move away from CA. You guys seem SO MUCH HAPPIER in Colorado every time.
Ryland you left me hanging. Ugh! Best of luck, fingers crossed and prayer sent .
omg this house is PERFECT !!!
please move... say goodbye to la its time. this house is so beautiful!!
I did teared up when Ryland's mom asks Shane to sit with her. I'm sorrrrrry 😭
I’m so happy for you guys. ❤️
Why did I get emotional watching this??? 😭😭😭
I couldn’t be more excited for you and Morgan. Colorado is such an amazing place to settle. Congrats
Oh my god, this house is literally everything. 😍😍🤯
It’s gorgeous. I would think my dreams came true. I can’t believe you did that! A cliffhanger.😂
You have to buy this house it is everything anyone would want love love love 💕
Ask for some of the furniture in the offer
Omg  buy  buy  buy
Stunning and seems meant to be! If you don't want to get rid of your California house, could you turn it into an AirBnB?
SUCH A COZY HOUSE OMG ✨💖I LOVE IT!
i think this would be a fresh start and really good for you guys!!! hope you get the house!!!
I got super emotional watching this. I've followed both of your stories for a long long time. I am super excited for this next adventure! This house just feels so much like you guys and you deserve a peaceful safe place to raise your family and be close to those who love yall. LA was your dream but you've both grown and changed so much. There is nothing wrong with new dreams. 🥰
I honestly can so see them there wholeheartedly 🤍
Buy it! Buy it!
Love the house
Omg the house is soooo nice!!! I can imagine you guys living there already with the pets it’s so homey i love it buuuuy
OMG they need to buy that house. I can see them living there already. Shane was so happy and giddy. Loved hearing him that happy again.
House looks very homy and feels very light!
I honestly cried. It's amazing what you can get in Colorado compared to California!!!
I would absolutely die to be able to purchase a house like this 🙌 Its absolutely stunning and I think with what yall want in the future, it would be perfect for you! I cant believe you left us hanging on the offer 😫😫😫
SHANE WAS SO EXCITED FROM SEEING THE HOUSE HE PURPOSEFULLY PUT HIMSELF ON CAMERA AND SAID HI. not saying he couldnt regardless but it's just the excitement he had and "bubble guts" were so high he completely forgot about his uncomfortability and imma just say thats a home feeling.
I love this for y'all ❤
Me: i hope this house looks like their LA home but in Colorado  - the kitchen looks the same here!  And the rooms looks like ryland has already decorated it!!  Buuuuyyy iiittt!!
im happy for the both of you! I love you both❤
As I was watching it I thought you gotta get married there and then Shane said it 🤣🤣
Shane’s like “I’ll only buy the house if you include the knick knacks” tbh me too
Buy it, I love that house
Omgggg. I hope yall got it!!!!!!!!! It was perfect. And yall would be so much happier being close to the family. Good luck!!!
I got chills watching this?? I’m so happy for you guys, I hope it works out!
I really hope you guys get the house. You two seem so happy, and seeing Shane this happy is so nice. I think it's best to get away from L.A. it's toxic and it's nice to start fresh and be around the people you love most. Also, I hate the end clip of you saying "we but the offer on the house, and....." I wanna knowwwww!!!! <3
I like how I shed a tear because of how badly I want it 😂 I hope you guys can get this beauty, I think it’ll be your perfect forever home. I feel like a fresh start where you can be surrounded by family and nature would fill both of your hearts. 🥰
Why am I crying while watching this
momma dawson should get the guest house and call it a day, that house is MAGICAL
the fact that I live in Denver, and you wont be that far.. Want to be friends haha?
Love it!!! Thank you for calling it a main bedroom and not a master bedroom. ❤️🙏🏼
i love dad so much he’s so cute
I love how his daddy is making wedding plans 🥺🥺🥺
Shane’s mom can move with you and live in the barn apartment
So nice to see Shane I really think he needs this, he seemed to light up. Love this whole family so lovely xxx
I started to cry when dad started talking about wedding venues so casually
“For the first time I’m an after shot” MEEEE!!!
Rylands dad: “at least im a democrat”💀💀 killed me
Moveeeeee
What about Teresa ?
Honestly let’s be honest this will be the best thing for Shane mental health wise stress Shane could honestly retire if he wanted he’s been on YouTube so long it would be the best for both Shane and ryland relationship …. The only thing would be Shane’s mom ….
Really..CLIFFHANGER 🥺🥺 not cool lol
Soo happy for you guys ♡
This house would be so good for the both of y’all !!!!
I wonder if Shane’s mom would follow?❤️
oh my gosh i am sooo happy for you guys, you always seem so much happier with your family and i can really imagine you guys starting a family there!
I want this house and I’m in a different hemisphere. So happy for you guys!!
“I want you guys to be happy with whatever you do but love to have you here”  Their dad is so precious 🥺❤️
Why don't you put up the la house fort rent and not sale? That way you would have another source of income that eventually pays off your new house
I’m so excited for you guys! I hope you get it!! The new start and memories you guys will make 🥺 literally priceless
I’m in love with this house.
Ahhh! The cliffhanger. I really hope you guys got the house, it's beautiful! ❤️
OMG, I hope they take your offer. This house is beautiful. You both look so happy as you were touring it.
Aww, that guest house in the barn is a perfect place for Shanes mom to visit <3
They NEED this house!! Shane’s mom can even live in the giant guest house above the barn omg. This house is so dreamy and everything I want some day I hope they get this soooo bad
Omfg that house is so beautiful if I could buy something like that I so would. You guys so have to get it it’s perfect for you guys. 🤘🏼😊
It’s beautiful and I think you should have a fresh start!
if they don't buy this house, i will!!! it's literally perfect :)
Excuse meeeee, get back here and tell us the offer got accepted. Please and thank you.
Shane buy this house plz!!!! U need this next step in ur future marriage and family...you will not regret it.....

. What once was  " this is everything " someday ..isnt everything anymore. It's the journey of life. Happy memories boys. Let the past go. Onward n forward ...
drop the next vlog rn!!
The house is absolutely STUNNING! Literally a dream home! Prayers y’all get it 💛
That cliff hanger at the end makes me feel like they didn’t get it :-( The housing market is not leaning in the buyers favor at the moment
Where's part 2 ?!?! I need to know if we got our dream house !?!? 🥺
OMG AND.......?
That house is absolutely GORGEOUS!!! Plus it's adorable how excited Shane was!!! 💞😊🥰
Oh hellz naw! YOU need to get a REAL COWBOY HAT Mamas! Get ON IT! 🤠👱🏼‍♀️👍🏼👍🏼
Move! Make farm vlogs. I’d love watching those.
Just me dyiiing to see them get new animals at this house !!!!!
what about teresa? is she gonna stay with u guy if u move here? or maybe the barn house
Idk why but I got so emotional for you guys. I'm hoping your offer was approved and you guys can have those amazing family memories there.
Y’all should move & Theresa can move into the LA house or the guest house in the CO home.   Also Ryland’s dad has to take Shane fishing!
what about Shane's family??  😭🥺
I want to see more of Shane 🥺
So happy for you guys enjoy the next chapter of your lives ♥️
If you'all dont buy this house, I'm hoppin on a plane from Toronto and gonna smack ya.   You both would be soo happy. A loving family around you, peace for Shane's mind. All the videos Ryan can make outside.   Seriously, you live once... dont let this one go.
Love the house, Love Colorado,. both so beautiful.. We live in CA too and if we moved it would be to Colorado. Only thing is you have to live in Snow. But if you can afford the House in LA and this ones only half the price, you can afford to have someone dig out your driveway and front door when the snow comes. I hope you get the house. Being near family is important. We are near our Mothers where we live.
This house was madeeee for them !!!
I wish I could know where that homes owners got their dining table and that basement couch. I love them so much!
How far away is taco bell ??? Shane needs that!
The house and property are dreamy! Also, so happy Shane finally showed himself!
The kitchen configuration is really similar to your current LA home. I love it!
Sooo beautiful! I hope y’all get it!
Congratulation guys
Im in love!! You have to get this house! It's gorgeous!!
You better say you got that house!!! OMG you both need this so much. Get the hell out of LA and make a family. I can see how happy you will be in Colorado.
Maybe postmates is harder to get lol lol
This house I can tell will make you guys so much happier. You can tell how happy it made Shane and you and your family.
Omg !!! I would LOVE to see you guys in this house!! AHHHH I HOPE YALL GET IT!!😩❤️❤️❤️
Think of how many Christmas decorations he could store in that basement.
I think the whole family is ready for this new chapter
Your dad smiled so big when he saw the big fish in the pond! Imagine the memories you'll make with him there! ❤️❤️ I hope you guys move and stay in CO 🥰
Buy the house...buy the house...it's so beautiful
I caaaan’t with this cliffhanger Ry. I hope it’s a yessss
At the end I started crying, I really hope you all get the house it's beautiful and I think it would be a beautiful place to raise your family! 👪
That’s literally one of the most beautiful homes i’ve ever seen, really suits you two!
I hope you guys get the house !!!!
That house is amazing!  I hope you get it!
Oh my god!! That house is literally Hilary  Duff - what dreams are MADE OF yesssss💖🙌🏼  You’ve hit the jack pot guys in life & love 💝
I Love Rylands Family . His dad Planning the wedding and Mom plotting to either have her private corner OR YOU CAN BUY IT FOR ME LMAO too cute
If u can afford this place then TAKE IT! Get out of LA! Imagine ur peace of mind body n soul living there! No more drama!
They definitely don’t deserve this but ok smh wish Garrette and Andrew could be apart of this 😏
THINKING about moving??? MOVE!!!! For real..... that house is gonna make the 2 of you so happy! (look at Morgan)  Less rooms maybe but so much space to make rooms. Think out of the box!!! That house is stunning and hopefully Shane's mom can move too 😁
Christmas trees 😂 I live in the land of the pines in NC. It’s nothing but pine trees lol. You get so sick of them on occasion. Maybe if I call them Christmas trees all the time I’ll like it more.
Hearing Shane call rylands grandmother “grandma” just melts my heart
Shane: oh my gosh poniessss me: omg look it’s the devil reincarnated they want horses until they realize how much work they are and how aggravating they can be😂
So what makes you happy, if you think that you might be happier other there then LA, that's fine.
Ok, if you can afford it, you NEED to buy that house!  Seriously you all had such a visceral reaction to entire property and that kitchen? Seem identical to current home….so you obviously enjoy the style.  Just stunning property
Omg we need the next vlog now!!!!!!! 😩 love you both I hope you guys really got the house it’s so beautiful ❤️
Shane genuinely seems so happy about moving there 🥺❤️ I hope it all works out!!
How do they get the animals there too?  I love they bring them along
Everytime they get rodents they leave. They did the same thing with the last house. They're moving!
Omg its soooo beautyful
I think you need the move. I am praying you get the house.
CA is the most overrated state. I’ve lived here for a few years because my husband had employment requirements here. Two words- screw CA! Our move to TN can’t come soon enough. Hope you embrace change and make the move- leave CA and don’t look back! It’ll be the best decision you two ever made together
I really hope you guys get this house & move. The happiness both of you guys showed was truly heartwarming. I think being out of la is mentally what Shane needs as well. Love this video
really hope y’all get this house, move on to the next adventure!! ❤️❤️
Oh my gosh get this house it's perfect!
Ryland’s dad is so pure 🥺
I really hope you guys get it
hopefully Elizabeth doesn't go away if you move. or figure out a way to still do the podcast together.
Aww that would be great for you guys it's beautiful home it be nice to get away from LA ❤❤❤❤👍👍👍😍😍
God SHANE stop putting shit over your face or glasses on its annoying. I miss your uploads n wish you'd just get over it already n just come back already. I watch Morgan and ryland still.
I really really hope that you get that house or another one you like. Leaving LA would be the best decision you could make. Not only is LA and the social media influencer hub Toxic af, but you'd be close to family. And who knows, maybe you'll take Shane's mom with you with all that room.
Omg i love the house and the family moments in this vlog 😍
Imagine all the new vlogs and videos at this place
Hoping and praying for you to get this house. Family is everything and I love you all moving back to your home state.
This what families dream of.....that house is a dream
this house is beautiful. i hope you guys get it! but i also hope the podcast continues!!!
Be honest, are y’all moving because of the rats lol 😂 Just kidding, I hope you guys do buy the house.
If you don’t do it I’m convinced you’re insane
i think moving into this house could actually be good for the both of them. and maybe they can also buy a house for Momma Dawson??? GO FOR IT, GUYS!!! <3
The house is so beautiful you guys deserve everything I'm so happy for you can't wait to see what the future holds for y'all😊💙💙💙💙
OMG! This house is Everything you could ever dream of!  It is so much worth leaving CA for!!!
Shane's mom could buy a MANSION in Colorado!!!!  It's not even a factor.  Get outta that toxic city and breathe the free "Christmas tree" air my friends!  hehe
RYLAND. STOP MAKING US WAIT!!! -_-
why is no one questioning shanes return?!?!?!?!
You guys need to move there its perfect
If you don't get this house...
Loveeee it!!
This is so wholesome. I loved getting to hear Shane's laugh.
I love the house so much I want to buy it myself :D
the house is so beautiful and i hope u guys get it 🥰🥰
Use your other house as a airbnb.. hire a management company and boom
omg I'm crying
This is so exciting, loved the house it definitely has future family vibes x
'at least i'm a democrat' we love
That house is beautiful! I hope you get it Shane needs to get out of that city life and into the country living for his mental health ❤️
8:58-9:03 i was thinking the same thing 😂😂
We really trust Brad 😂
Nnnoooooo cliff hanger
I love Ryland dad! I wish my dad was liken him ♡ He look just so lovely person and support him tru every thing and he is funny! ♡   Hope you get the house ♡ I think it going   to be good for you both ♡ Hope you having a lovely summer ♡
I just love you guys love you Ryland love you Shane glad to see Shane’s face again😎🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Coming Soon Goat Yoga!
That house was built for y’all :) love it 🥰
Literally smiled through out the whole video (: I hope you guys are happy with whichever decision you guys make <3
I think them moving to Colorado would be good for them. Shane mom could always visit. Or even live there once she retires.
Beautiful home ❤️
So did you? Who edited this!? Shane!?
Omg please say you got this house 🏡 🐎 🐄 🌳
I don’t care what he goes through or what people think about any of his regretful moments. I like Shane A LOT. I think he is so funny and good hearted and I love his facial expressions and self deprecating sense of humor. I have missed him so much. Both of you.❤️ Whatever mistakes Shane has made in his life  that’s his journey that he is on. Those are his mistakes to make that’s how we grow. Get out of his way and don’t interfere with his personal business or you will interrupt his timing and progress you will throw him off. It takes a long time to realign yourself when people or issues have knocked you around.  All of my favorite people disappeared at the same time. Chris D’Elia, Bryan Callen, Shane Dawson, Jenna Marbles... knowing that you were all hurting inside was such an awful thing to feel. It was heart crushing. And the injustice of it all. And here you are now. You made your way back to us. You could have closed that door and never looked back but you grew and made yourself stronger. You made a plan and then you prepared yourself and here you are Shane. ❤️Hooray! You are so strong! Bro every single one of us has fkd up royally. Many times! There isn’t one bad bone in your body and you are just such an enormous sparkle in everyone’s eyes. So glad to have you back home where you belong. Woo Hoo! 😎👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
GOODBYE LA!! 👋🏼 Hah
Oh my.. that property is so beautiful, I wanted to cry .. (apologies to my home 🙏 I love you dearly, please don't start falling apart 🙏😬..). ...  What a cliff hanger!!! 😲😱
As you age life changes, obviously. Throughout life you’re going to have MANY different dreams and “dream houses.”I think this is perfect for the next stage of your life though 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💯 💕 🏡
I will rent out that guest house Im trying to move out of LA I’m being so serious, I love you guys
This honestly made me cry. I'm so happy for you all. This is what life about
The house was amazing! The interior is insane! Love it!🥰
Oh. My. God. That is YOUR house!! I cried looking at it. And seeing the pig in the barn???? That’s a sign. So happy for you guys. I got such good energy from that property. It is the most beautiful home I’ve ever seen
LOVE IT!!!!!! carp aren’t good though :/
Nooo you can’t just end it with we put an offer down on the house, we want to know what happens next!
I really hope you guys move 😍😍
Excuse my language but FUUUUU..k!!!! I got chills and almost cried for you both. I'm hoping your bid wins the place. This was awesome.
I am excited for Shane to be in a better place mentally
This house is so cool! I hope you guys can get it!
wait did we ever think about if Shane even wants to come back? what if he's happier not having to make videos...
Shane loves snow!!!
I literally had a panick attack at work this morning and took the day off. Then I see the new vlog is up and I watch it and I feel so much better. The whole family just seemed so happy and loving . It feels like the correct decision. I hope you can move to Colorado and be close to family . You two deserve it!!!! ♥️
I hope you guys move
The house is stunning
LIVING ME AND SHANE'S SCREAM FANTASY ! LOL loving it more than anything ! Does it come with Courtney Cox??????
Awesome!!!
This is my favorite video of all of them together, even Grandma is saying they should buy the house. I love the house and the land it's on. Christmas will be so beautiful. I can see a vlog with Ryland and Shane getting the house deco for Christmas with snow and all of those pine trees. There is so much they could do there, Shane could move his Mom there. Morgan, Mom, Dad, Grandma, are nearby down the road. The dogs and cats will love it there... Colorado is beautiful.... Ugh, not a cliffhanger.. lol
Matching pink tractors
I’m so happy to hear Shane’s laugh again.
Shane! You do not go fishing in your pond!
I LOVE YOU SHANE
I'm getting emotional looking at that beautiful house! It's so homey, cosy and feels like you're in a forest cabin. Stunning! 😀 Imagine decorating all the christmas trees
What about Shane’s family?
Let me just tell you. My cancer husband was soooooo scared to leave the city.... when I tell you a lot of his anxiety and depression and other mental health issues got SOOO MUCH BETTER after we moved... their home is TRULY in a space like that. Where they can be the best parent they can bE WITHOUT the pressures and environment of the city❤️ so happy for you both!! Hope it works out! Finally at peace and happy!
This house is anazing..you both have to move here. Just promise me tgat no matter where you live you both will continue to clog. I would miss you both so much if I couldn't watch you on YouTube. I absolutely love you both and I'm a huge fan of Morgan as well.
You guys!!! EEEEEKKKKK!!! Love this house and land! BUY IT!! I am so so so so so happy for you guys! All your hard work is paying off. I love your videos and when I see your whole family surrounding you in love, it makes me cry happy tears. I hope you guys continue to make your dreams come true and that we get to watch it. Miss you Shane and we are so happy to have you back. The world needs you!
I feel like you guys would be sooo so happy there surrounded by family and nature and just so much love! I can only imagine how hard it would be to leave that beautiful LA home but man.... Even just seeing the house on the vlog not even in person was so peaceful! I could only imagine living there. Would also be such an amazing wedding venue!
I could just feel the soothing, healing, nature vibe radiating from that place. I want this for them so badly.
Last week I was outbid for a house like a block over from this one… sad we won’t be neighbors but mazels and best wishes guys!
This makes me wanna leve California even more and I finally am in 15 days 🤩 I'm so excited for a better life and better people
I am so happy for you both! All of you really! You both really don't seem to be "city" people. I really hope your next video comes out quickly and I really hope you got the house!
its the zoom in on the door knobs for me
This makes me so happy 😊 y'all look so happy there!!!
I’ve been missing you guys ❤️
Omg! I love it! This is the perfect family home!
Move there
This property is STUNNING😍! Congratulations 🍾🚜🏡
Beautiful place! Move out of Cali and Shane would be happier getting away from all the drama!
Can someone tell me why I am crying my eyes out at this!!! The house is beyond beautiful, you and Shane seem so happy surrounded by family. Everything crossed you get it!
did yall consider shanes mom orrrrr?
Sir! How dare you, with the cliffhanger?! I need to know! The house is stunning, and I am hopeful that whatever happens, is the right move for both of you, to be able to be fully happy and recognize all your dreams! ❤️
I'm so happy ❣️❣️❣️❣️
Get Morgan the damn tractor xd
I know it’s not my bank account… but you BETTER get this house!!!!!!! BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT
Yes this needs to happen, you wouldn’t be just getting a new house, you’d be getting a wedding venue too! How perfect would that be to have the wedding at your new house! :’) ❤️ And Shane’s mom should move into the guest barn house 😄
Wow this place is awesome.  Can I move in too  ? Lol. Love it !!
I think everyone who has the chance to buy and live in their dream home will be in heaven for only a year because yes that may have been you dream but is it practical? Is it necessary? Is it what you really actually wanted? Nope, this house is their true dream home ❤️
it’s very, “retire happily with a big family” vibe ❤️❤️
Thats a healing space x very good vibes you both need it x its so good to shane back again xxxx
Wow for forst time I listened to lod cast instead of watched ot as I was at the gym so had it on and I was in stitches while on the treadmill hahaha
This is going to be life changing for you both.  Absolutely perfect to raise a family. And to be near family that loves you. I think you will both be happier there.
I felt the excitement and joy this house was giving all of you! I really hope you got it. ❤🤞❤
Awh no I’m crying! I’m going to be so happy for you all if you actually move there! It’s a beautiful house! And you and Shane seem so happy to be in that space!🥺❤️
shane live for you not ryland
What is that plant in the pot behind you in the beginning i want it ?
I want y’all to love to the new house so bad!!! It’s beautiful
❤
I’ve been watching Shane since he started (like 10 years)…while I’m so happy to see him get the goal house in LA and get engaged to a wonder man and his family - this seems more their speed. They both need to experience as much as they can while they still can. It would be so good to have everyone so close!
The house is absolutely gorgeous!
Omg guys I’m so excited for y’all, that house with that landscape is off the charts AMAZING, and it’s always great to live closer to family so y’all can raise all the future kiddos together!!! I love it!!!  P.S.  I swear I thought the women who said that her daughter rides horses was Rylands mom, I had to rewind it and get a double shot after she said that because I thought to myself she wouldn’t say that because her daughter just bought her own farm style house & land lol!!
Shane! 💕
I’m seriously so happy to see you guys living your best lives. You guys deserve to be happy
From the tone of his voice in the end when he said, "so we put an offer in the house and..." kinda sounded like maybe their offer was declined
This will be a good for both of you mentally ,physically and emotionally. You need a break from L.A . Shane is so excited and naturally happy walking in he felt like  he’s at home we love seeing him with his beautiful smile once again .  Hope you don’t pass this house up . This could lead to a much wonderful  future. That would be my dream house . 🤞🏻
🖤🖤🖤 may all good things & positive vibes come your way 🖤🖤🖤 you guys deserve it.
Can you imagine all the projects ryland could do to this house 😍😍 Lol
IM GAGGING AT HOW GORGEOUS THAT HOUSE IS! MOVE OUT OF CALIFORNIA NOW! TAKE ME WITH YOU!
I wasn’t expecting Shane to be more gung-ho on the move to Colorado but that’s awesome!! I thought ryland would have to do some convincing but it doesn’t appear that way. Congrats guys!🙂
The kitchen is so cute I can already see you and Morgan doing cooking videos there 😭❤
Ok but like I’m already ready for next vlog lmao
I hope you get it! You two deserve it!
I swear if they don’t buy that house I will move to Colorado and buy it myself
I think the best thing to do for your mental health is to move out of California!
Wait no!!! Why am I crying!?? Please say you got it! More vlogs, a baby slash family vlog, farm house, animals oh my! I'm so happy for you and Shane! 😭😭🙏🙏🙏
OMG I'm literally crying. Soooo happy 😊 for you.
I swear if you dont move in, I will <3 This house is amazing! just perfect
The most beautiful house ever ❤️ I hope you guys get it 😭

I hope you guys get this!!! THIS IS GOALS!!!!!! HONESTLY!!! IT'S EVERYTHING!!!! GAH!!!
*turns into a family vlog channel*
that view from the main bedroom is so beautiful 🥺 so much green
this seems made for both of you please do it!! it’s beautiful
Why do I feel like once they actually saw the house Shane is more gung-ho about it than Ryland
I’m so happy for you guys, I hope you’ll get it ❤️
Shane worried about Postmates 😂
WOW. That place is PURE MAGIC. I just felt so strongly that it was meant to be your house. Everything about it was stunning. I wouldn't change a THING about the decor. It's just incredible.I hope you get it! 💜
This made me cry 😭 yall HAVE to get it!!!! Get the hell out of LA and start a family .
GAHHHH YOU’RE killing me!!!! It’s such a beautiful home!!!
If yall didn't buy that house you will regret  it for the rest of your lives!!!!! How AMAZING!!!!!!
Tease!!!!!! Post the next video!!!!! You guys looked so good there and so happy! Shane especially needs some extra happiness! I hope you got it.  Can't wait for the next vlog
For Shane's mental health I hope you guys get this house. Being out of LA for the first time in his life surrounded by a big supportive family will help Shane like nothing else
Oh my gosh guys!! That house! 😲❤ How beautiful! So perfect for family and friends ❤
I don't think I've smiled for 20 minutes straight like I have just now.  Shane looks great, and you both look so happy there.  Sending super power positive vibes you get it.  A place to really settle down and be happy.
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS...😻🐶
I hope you guys got the house! I've lived in Arkansas almost my entire life, and I'm actually moving to Colorado this weekend!
I felt like I was right there with you guys.  I felt every emotion with you. I have a feeling this will be an awaking for Shane. I can see him out and about more. Enjoying mother nature.  Let me be one of the first to say CONGRATULATIONS. I see great blogs to come.
You guys are all so cuteeeee
Im Speechless 🙊 Can't wait to see the next episode! To New Beginnings 🥂 (hopefully)
Loved this vlog so much and seeing Shane smile was everything. The cliffhanger of "and" at the end... Ok so when's the next vlog so we know the answer? Lol what a beautiful house.
You guys could get married here!! This is my literal dream house 😭😭😭😭
Oh how I hope they get this house! Ryland's parents are so sweet, you can tell they love the idea of Shane and Ryland living closer.
Shane looks so good!! Ugh I love him!!
I've been struggling pretty bad lately and this video uplifted me so much.  Its so amazing to see your family all so much happier right now.  I'm so thankful to be able to watch your lives and watch you grow.  I can't wait to see what the future has in store.  Youre all incredible and deserve the best ♡♡
I got goosebumps looking at that beautiful house ❤️
A brand new start, out of LA...um...YES!  I hope you guys go for it!
Love both you guys really hope Shane makes a come back i miss all his content
i’m so jealous that’s my dream home
So many parts of this video made me tear up🥺🥺🥰🥰
Colorado is an amazing place to live...can’t recommend enough
It's the dream property lets be honest, wow. You need to make this move, it will be the best thing for you.
The pandemic has change many people’s priorities and we are still heading for bumpy hills & difficult times worldwide so it is my belief that people should be closer to family and those they hold dear to ride the storms and to rebuild a new future because what was is not anymore and a new reality is in horizon . I sensed this was there home and future .God bless you both
That place would be so good for both of your mental health. I really hope y'all buy it.
Screw LA, move.  That place is amazing.  You have to get it.  If Morgan had her eggs fertilized with Shane to have a baby for Ryland and Shane, then the baby would have Ryland and Shane's DNA and be blood related rather than one of them have a surrogate with someone outside the family.  Weird?  Maybe, but then technically both of their genes will be with their child.  I used to work with a girl who gave her eggs to her sister to have them fertilized with her sisters husband because her sister's eggs were messed up.  They wanted to have her family genes with her husband than use a stranger.
Do it! I hope you get the house, your home, and create new memories. You’re young, you obviously love this beautiful home, I sure hope you do this. When you get old, older, the worst thing is regrets. So many, too many times I think how much I regretted not saying yes to things. It really is a sucky feeling, I wish upon no one. Do it!!! Make that jump!! Wish you the best.
Shane’s laugh and happiness & presence is EVERYTHING. I love this house for you guys 😭❤️
Omg if they do move Shane’s mom could stay in the upstairs part of the barn when she visits. Unless she wants to move too
Oh they NEED this!!
Could you imagine a backyard wedding by the pond 🥰
Omg that house totally suits y’all! All of y’all are so happy together just looking at the house. New happy memories. I’m super excited and y’all haven’t even bought it yet! Can’t wait I really hope y’all get it ❤️
Pweaazzzzz say y’all bought this house because this yalls expressions were truly everything and my heart melted 💖😭
Ugh!!! Lol so are you guys moving ?! I think you guys should!😉

they need to get away from LA and just start a new life
The only bad part would be leaving Shane’s mom, Andrew and Garret and Lizzie behind in LA. I know they could all come and visit but it still wouldn’t be the same not seeing them all the time anymore in videos. However I do LOVE this house for Shane and Ryland!

I've had many many dreams about houses with secret rooms and tunnels and things like that and it kind of reminds me of my dreams. You could always get a pool put in. My dream house would have to be something that has an ocean view. I have a view of a pond in my apartment and it's very calming. Can't wait to see the next video
I can already see the red iconic horse in the entrance of the barn
Great house!

Listen.....who wouldnt love to live there? I want to live there. It so beautiful. So so so beautiful. I would love to see Shane and Ryland grow their family in such a beautiful home.
People need to stop talking down on LA. People talk so much shit about it yet always wanna be out here.  The people who make LA look bad is people who aren't even from LA & try to be someone they ain't!
Say good bye to LA dude
Your dad will never go home!!! He can sleep in the barn!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
When y’all went and saw the pond I literally started crying omfg Shane we came so farrrr
This house is so beautifull. It is the perfect house fore you 2. I hope you will get it and will be so happy.
Oh please that house was MADE for you guys ❤️
I think you should get. like it such a beautiful house  and ugh it beautiful to live in country because you all to your self with nature  and live by  yourself  and that house is perfect for yall I hope you get it 🙏 ❤ yk it hard to say bye to  your house   but I think if it a new beginning  then you should go for it and be happy on your new house

I hope you guys get it ❤️
That house is a dream 😍 i know its a huge decision moving to a whole other state. But i think getting out of the la life will be so good for you both ❤️
This made me so emotional 😭❤️ I’m so happy for you guys ❤️❤️ is honestly perfect! I feel like the house you guys have now was for your a different time in your life, but you’re getting married and moving on! And it’s just a more family home!
ima miss mama teresa though 😭
I love hearing the excitement in shane and ryland’s voices 🥺 you both deserve this!!! ❤️
I got HYPER when I saw that living room and kitchen area and then the rest of it ohmygosh. Having land like that around family is truly invaluable. Also that CLIFF HANGER - why you do this to us - my now hyper state cannot handle it!
This is giving the old house vibes when they first walked in🥺
This is your house! I can feel it ! Congrats it's beautiful

It’s worth it do it

Doooo it!! This place is AMAZING!!!!
BRB gonna convince my parents to move to Colorado😫😭
Stop itttt y’all better moveee so excited for yall
This is such the right move, LA is a toxic city with a toxic culture, yes it’s also bustling and there’s so much there but settling down, taking life slow, enjoying life, this is perfect, this is the kind of place I’d love to have with a husband if I wanted weans
JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS   Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE. Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours😊❤❤💞❤💌
Wow, that house is amazing!!!
its all about ryland ryland ryland HE whats to move out there to be with his family but what about shanes family?

💙
It’s so beautiful it has me tearing up ❤️
When Shane walked to Rylands dad and asked ''did they build it good?'' 14:53 entrusting him with house quality knowledge is such me and my dad moment. I almost cried.

Shane 😍🥰💜💜💜💜💜💜🙌🏻
Damn...cliffhanger ending.
Can we get some Shane conspiracy content next please
DO I seriously have to wait a whole week to hear what happened 😵😵😵 I hope you guys got you. You both look so happy there 😊
To think I could go to the local king soopers and see Shane and Ryland!!!! 🥳🥳🥳
I'm in Colorado! Welcome. Can we do lunch!!!
Buy the house, Shane and Ryland. That house is awesome
This house is so beautiful. Get out of LA it’s so toxic
I honestly feel like if you guys get this house you'll be so much happier... I really hope you guys get this house it's so you! ALSO could be a great place for a wedding!I'm so excited for you guys!
OMG that house is gorgeous🤭
I feel like this would be an amazing opportunity for you guys mentally, just being around family and in a place like that really makes a huge difference in mental health. Get the the hell out of California.
Moves Morgan to LA to live in your house, kicks Morgan out, moves into the office apartment with Morgan, Morgan gets her own house in Colorado, wants to move to Colorado as well. See Ryland you love your sister and want to be close to her because you really do care. It’s so cute to see and how your sibling relationship has truly changed as you have become adults.
Love it!!! I hope it all works out 😊
“Is this enough closet space?”  Shane: “I have one shirt”  I CRIEDD 🤣🤣🤣 same shane same LOL!!
I’m at 6:54 watch time and I’m CRYING BECAUSE THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU AND SHANE! It gives me family vibes and it feels like it’s meant to be for you two!♥️ I’ll come back when I finish watching. 😊  (Now after watching) I hope you guys got the house I really do! I feel like after being surrounded by family and being so excited it’s meant for you guys to live out the rest of your lives together!☺️
Los Angeles has done NOTHING but hurt and betray you and Shane with horrendous lies and hypocrisy!  I think Colorado would be a wonderful, clean new beginning for you both!  LA is such a superficial place, maybe Shane would stop hating himself when he sees that “real” people look like him.
C’mon, you wouldn’t show it unless you got it…😜
Omg I hope y’all get this house!!!
If you move you have to take your lemon tree whit you ryland 😅💞
Hopefully you guise buy that house it’s soo gorgeous omg I’m in love it looks so peaceful …. That’s house is made for you guise ☺️
I know it’s not my apology to accept but I’m really happy to see Shane getting back to himself
SO EXCITED I HOPE THE GET THIS HOUSE!!!
Aww darn don't leave us hanging! 😆
They all look so happy. I hope this happens for them
Omg u have to get this house its amazing u guys seem so happy
Just buy it you'll like it it suits you both one there and one in California both of you can be happy together when you're visiting you can stay there and if you want to go back to California what up buy it just buy it have a good day or night
This video legit made me smile...
ANYTIME YOU GUYS ARE IN  COLORADO YOU JUST SEEM SO MUCH HAPPIER!
How the hell did I get this on my recommendation though ?
Oh my gosh please buy this house
I'm literally crying with happiness for you guys. You have stood by Shane through this whole bullshit shit show. Ryland and family thank you so much for helping the man that helped me get over my daughter being taken into care. Shane you kept me alive. NOW BUY THAT HOUSE AND LEAVE LA BEHIND. Its toxic and I only know that cause I am an intuitive empath. Go for it guys... I wish you all the happiness you deserve 💜🤝💜
The barn House is perfect for lizzie!
I hope you guys get the house it is beautiful!
WoaW 😯😯😯 that house is absolutely Stunning ...!!!!! Just Amazing ...!!!! I am a city girlie ,but if I was able to afford a house like that ..!!! I would most definitely get it ...
Omg so happy for y'all ❤️😍❤️
Aww! This was such a sweet vlog! Almost had me in tears with how happy and excited ya’ll are! And what a cliff hanger!!! My fingers are crossed ya’ll will get it but if you don’t, there is always another perfect house out there!
I hope & pray you guys get this ❤️❤️❤️
It’s always nice to move back home. ❤️
Could you imagine them buying the house and then having their wedding in the backyard of their forever home?!?! Ahhhhh😍😍😍
You guys I’m so happy to finally see Shane happy and excited it’s so cute ❤️
i miss shane’s videos :( hope he is doing better
This video made me want to earn on evans
Yesss 😍😍❤️
Welcome home luv birds! XOXOXO
looks like my dream house honestly. Smaller house big land. My dream
Shane can have his mom visit and she could stay in the guest house
I love seeing Shane so happy and comfortable being on camera. Perfect home for you both, so many signs it’s meant to be your forever home 😍
Plant nerd here… Morgan called a spruce a pine tree.
AND??? AND??? You can't leave us with that! :(
Lol I bought the shirt Shane is wearing in the intro and I’m happy it looks so good on him
I love this house!!!
I personally would leave LA
Can I rent out the barn guest room? I bake, I can babysit, I clean up after myself and I don't take things/food etc without permission.
Does anyone else LIVE for grandma moments in the vlog?! YAS QUEEN. It always puts a smile on my face 😂💕
Sell LA home buy this house and use proceeds to get a surrogate and have some babies
I feel like moving there would be the best thing they would do
The joy that exuded from you all because of that house .. those are the emotions life is all about... I'm praying u guys got it and everything will work out ...
I feel that the move would be good for the two of them because they could have an actual fresh start and grow there without paparazzi or media getting in the way plus Shane seems generally happy with the idea of it as well which is also a good thing.
What a cliff hanger!!!! Hope you get it :)
I literally cried hearing the whole family being so excited for this house and hearing the family talk about having you guys closer. UGH all the feels! I wish you the best! Now I need the next vlog..!
Omggg ❤❤❤❤❤
He linked Shane's channel. Why'd he link Shane's channel? Does he always do that? Is this a sign?
Ryland- your mom is the absolute best!
Shane and Ryland need to get that house and then five a house for Shane’s mom
Lease your LA place,  get some revenue off it don't sell. Property is valuable.
LOVE LOVE LOVE THE HOUSE💝
BUY IT NOW
I wanna move to Colorado
Whyyyy do they want horses? Horses are so much work that will take over their life and I don’t think either of them ride
You guys NEED THAT HOUSE
Guys this house is perfect, I’m so happy I really hope you get it and move to Colorado. Just imagine the peaceful life that awaits for you
Please dnt make us wait please !!!!
I LOVE this house, I want one just like this
I can see them getting married in this backyard 💒
Same Shane! Lol I think that's a Cali thing we call Pine trees Christmas trees lol
I think this change will be very great for you and Shane!! I think you should just leave the toxic place and move where your family is. Of course Shane mom needs to move too. 🥺🥺 Praying for the best for you two!
I'm so happy for you and Shane!!!! You guys deserve this!
Omg I love that your dad is so supportive and loving.
THIS HOUSE IS  GORGEOUS !!! GET IT YOU DESERVE IT
SO GLAD TO SEE SHANE HAPPY
I love Rylands dad and the grandma 😍😍❤️❤️❤️
6:00 it’s a Blue Spruce!
Hope you get the house🙏🙏🙏
y0u guys NEED a change 0f scenery. it will bE GREAT!!!
Omg Ryands dad could teach shane how to fish in the pond. Honestly La is so toxic and they are so Happy in Colorado. This might be a good change if they decide to go through with it
Do it guys! Maybe keep the LA one for now. Cos his mama bear x
Omg I’m not mentally prepared for all this today 😭😭😭😢
AND...!?!?!?!
Omg beautiful you need to move
Love it but when can we see shane post on his chnl again
YOU CANT STOP LIKE THAT OMG I HOPE U MOVEEEEE TO BE WITH FAMILY
New series, morning coffee hour with Ryland's Mom.
That is your home...that boxy thing in L.A. is a house.
What a beautiful house!! Honestly love the atmosphere and vibe more than the one you have now. This is more you and Shane. And with family so close, that would be a perfect home for you two.
This place is INCREDIBLE!
If your looking for a nanny ✋🏻
I AM SOLD! lol I got all the feels @shanedawson & @Ryland_Adams. I'm crying cuz I just pictured ur babies growing here. Running around playing w the cousins. Coming to the half barn door & Ryland giving them drinks.This is ur new journey.This ur 4ever home. This ur everything home. 😍😭❤
Beautiful!!! Sooooo happy for you both.
You have to get it, You both looked so much happier even just for that little bit of time being there, imagine how happy you'd be  living a lifetime there!!  And Shane's mom could either move out there too, or visit lots !
That is actually so amazing. I hope you've got it guys. You will be so happy in Colorado, just you seem so happy with the family
I’ve watched Shane since I was growing up .. I wish there was a way to contact them I’m so so happy for their growth 🥺❤️I’d be a surrogate for them in a heartbeat
Wow that house is beautiful
Cowboy Dave hats
I LOVE THIS FAMILY
Beautiful house
I’m so happy there’s this new video today
The fires alone are reason to move. I love this house I hope your family thrives there!
Omg the suspense!! Love seeing you in the vlogs Shane. We've  missed you.🥰
God I hope they really buy this house. It’s so perfect for them
your making shane do this
Can't wait for the next video
Ryland can you make a horse rescue
Yesss😍😍.  Living now!
I hope from the bottom of my heart you 2 get that house
Matching tractors 😂😂😂 I love Morgan! ❤️
8:57 exactly what I was thinking
I like that there's a lil space for Shane's mom to come visit
Wow this was exciting to watch!
Morgan, watch the friends episode where Phoebe has her brothers babies… then you’ll want to do it for them
I feel they would be so much happier here
That is literally my fucking DREAM HOME
It’s so pretty Ryland🥴❤️❤️❤️
This is my dream home!!!  Invite me to your house warming party please! 😭🥺❤️❤️
If they leave LA how about shane`s mom? 😓
Ryland, think about Shane’s family too. This has becoming way too much you you you.
Made me cry😭 I'm so happy for both of you ❤❤
House is so amazing.  You should move.
Love you guys! please tell Shane I just was able to buy his CONSPIRACY pallet and gloss! Love to u both❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That house is so gorgeous!!! I think y'all would be so happy!! If y'all want it, I hope y'all get it!!! Y'all deserve it!!!
I'm getting such incredibly good vibes from this house. I can't really describe it. Maybe it's because I grew up surrouned by farms, but somehow the term "forever home" comes to mind.  If I were you I would strongly consider doing this. It just feels so... right.  In any case, I hope you're happy, whichever choice you'll make. <3
Dreams change and that’s OK
I’m going to cry if they don’t get this house. It seems so right for them.
I have cold chills 🥺
That house is everything. It is beautiful. I love seeing you and Shane so excited to start the next chapter of your lives together. Also seeing Shane so happy makes my heart sing 🖤🖤
Omg that is totally a shane office
Omg I hope you guys get it!
This made my heart happy! If you buy the house, please consider hiring a professional to treat the pond when needed. You can easily kill the fish if you do not know the chemicals well.
this house is literally PERFECT for shane and ryland omg
Beautiful farmhouse! I hope you bought it. 💙🇲🇽💙
You guys need a maid? That room in the barn is perfect for me!! Omg that house is life!!! Just watching the tour my blood pressure lowered!!  Just so wonderful!! That’s as close to Heaven as you can get on Earth!!! 🥰❤️😊❤️
Dad put your seatbelt on
They have to get it. That’s amazing.
how would they be able to take care that land? who will cut the grass?
I LOVE how happy Shane looks there!!! You can just tell that LA is toxic.... You guys are going to be so happy in that house near family!!!😭😭 I am so excited for this next journey we get to watch you guys go through!! I am praying this house works out for you guys!!❤❤
Absolutely gorgeous house. The LA house is fantastic, but the Colorado house is a HOME. I would move there in 2 seconds myself if i could. That house just feels like you (them). A home were 2 men could live a happy life. I hope you both get this house!
I live for your dad <3
Yassss live your best farm lives ❤️
this feels like a new era. I'm so excited for them! :,)
Seriously made me cry
Getting out of LA may be the perfect decision for them!
You guys need a new start!  Colorado is a beautiful place to do it!
No but in all reality I’m so happy for you guys I just hope we get to come with you when you do move
I’ve missed Shane in videos!!!!! 😭 but you guys that house Is perfect for you guys!!!! And honey will love Colorado winters!!!!!!!
This house is beautiful! I hope you get it! LA life is so different. Humans need nature
I'd take having that view any day over having less rooms!!!! Omg stunning!
I felt so happy watching this ☺
Y’all I’m just sayin I’ll stay in the guest house and take care of the horses and chickens and goats no problem
I hate cliffhangers lol
i want to move to Colorado :'(
The both of you finding happiness gives me such secondary joy.
The "Peace" sign was a sign to buy this house. You two need to get out of LA and have some peace! And joy in your lives!! There is nothing better than family. I hope you get it! 💖💖💖
Get. The. House.
I’m so proud and happy for both of you!!
I’m so happy for you guys 🥰 to see you both so happy it’s amazing 🤩
I have my fingers crossed for y’all!!!!
I love this for them! I wish I was the neighbor and could hang out there! It is beautiful! Congrats to the both of you.
Awwww look how gorgeous that house is before they move all their crap and clutter in! 😍
Need to move, house is great
Im crying this is my dream right now too 😭 ❤ was literally just looking to move to Colorado
I was sold at *_sledding hill_* ✌😂💓
I even want this house for my self !
I’m so happy for you guys!
We lived in the city for five years. Moved to the country.  It was the best decision that we could have ever made as a family. Best of luck. So happy for you guys.🤠❤
Move NOW! Go be happy and blessed in Colorado.
❤️🐽
also shane was so sweet in this video ahh i miss him haha <3 really appreciating your vlogs
Moving out of CA was the best decision for me. Do it guys!
I really hope you guys get that house it seems like something you guys really need / want, and it's a new adventure for all of you ❤️
I think is the best and good for both? Yes, but I also think its a little bit self centered for Ryland just bc family is so important to him but just his side, Shane’s side? Not so much and that’s scares me.
Man, what a beautiful house! Definitely my dream home. Ya’ll better buy it lol 😝
I am soooo excited for them!
Why are the owners selling this beautiful house?
That’s right come to Colorado 🤷🏻‍♀️❤️
I love your dad
So many signs pointing to the fact that this house is just meant for you guys!! I absolutely love seeing you both so happy and Shane, oh god how I’ve missed Shane! Incredibly happy to see you both thinking about such a positive future!
I'm moving to Colorado with y'all! Beautiful house!!!
Also I need your family to start an HGTV show now lol
I’m watching this on repeat because I can’t get over how beautiful the house is and how happy I can see you being here!!!
anyone found it on zillow yet? to see if it’s sold or not?👀
I am so excited that this just post. Thank you guys. I love you
"We put an offer on the house and" AND WHAT RYLAND?! POST THE NEXT VLOG NOW PLEASE
This made my heart so happy. Seeing both of you so excited and happy 😊 it was just lovely.
I am very happy for you two even if we don’t know if you guys get the property yet. It was perfect 😍
LA is so incredibly toxic, and California in general has been going downhill. Leaving LA is probably the best decision they could do for their own sanity and mental health. This makes me really happy.
I really hope they get this house it is so beautiful!
I cannot wait for the happy family vlogs and pictures in that gorgeous house (or any house)! You guys deserve all the happiness in the world! ❤️
If Shane doesn’t want to move then buy it for your mom
It seems ryland was crying when saying ge put on an offer. But my guess is its the bad kind of crying. Like they did not get it
Why am I crying over here imaging y’all raise your babies in this home 🥺🥺  I’m so in love with your journey!!  So happy for you guys
What is the price for this house?. It's gorgeous
Beautiful house! 😍🏡 However I think you'd have to take Shane's mom along too! 💞
I legit love Ryland's dad. 🥰
I'm wayyy too happy for you too!! I think it's a great decision!
Fucking Awesome 👏
I love how much Shane loves this house… I miss him so much
That house is perfect for you guys   I was crying because that’s the style of house I want
Y'all ain't buying a house there 🙄🤭😉😜
IM SO ESCITED BYE
it’s meant for you, the both of you 🤍
i really feel the colorado house is meant to be for you guys. standing by you w whatever you decide to do, seeing the way everyone lit up and got so excited was really smthn special to watch and its so fugging nice to see you guys living your dreams. can't wait until you and shane marry and start a family im sorry this video made me MEGA emo lol
This video made me so happy! 🥰
If I had that barn it would be a total time warp to a ‘73 house party, phones at the door joints at the ready it would be a 24/7 party in the past😭😭
I love the comment atleast I'm a Democrat 😂😂
This is such a gorgeous farm house I'm in love 😍
I started crying while you guys were walking through the house & the land. Such a beautiful place to raise a family 😭❤
I know you guys love LA but I feel like this house would be so good for you guys mentally and physically 💗 this made me cry
get this house get it now
If you don’t snatch up this house!!! Ima cry! It’s everything 😭😭😭😍
Oh how I miss an excited and happy Shane 🥺❤️
This vlog makes me so excited for you both!
So apparently part of the new problematic influencer rebranding strategy is moving out of la and buying a home in a rural area….
Lol Rylands dad is so excited and it’s adorable
11:33 not the Peter griffin outfit
Beautiful house! If the pig and dressing gowns weren't a sign the house should be yours I don't know what is! It would be beautiful for your wedding if you get it! I hope you guys do get the house 🤞
That house is everything! What would happen to The Sip if you moved? Either way, I hope you guys get it.
Not sponsored by Brad 🤣🤣🤣
This is honestly my dream house
HAHAHHA postmates harder to get 😂
Im i the only one who screamed when ryland said they put down a offer? Im so happy for them<3
If you guys don’t get this house I’m going to be SO FREAKIN PISSED
You can’t find the house on Zillow anymore, so praying they got the house 😍
I love you this whole family
I love seeing Shane so happy!
I literally said "and what?.....AND WHAT?!?!?!?......YOU CAN'T END THE VLOG WITH AND!" ugh the suspense now!
Ok I’m crying though
Holy cow I want this house
Wow I’m so excited and happy for u guys to wanting to take a big step for ur future together ❤️

I got bubble guys for you guys. I'm looking for a new place to live for myself my boyfriend and my nephew and are 5 cats. On a fixer income of under 1000 . It's so heard but I'm going to make it work for us . love you guys excited for you and your new adventure.
Wow, this is one of the most beautiful homes I've ever seen! The property is unreal with the little pond and hills. I really hope everything works out and they accept your offer. I'm so happy for you guys! ❤️❤️❤️
Shane’s mom can live in the barn guest house!!! 😊😊😊😊
I hope you guys get the house.  It looks amazing.

ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
Its perfect for you both!!  go for it!  xx
this reminds me of that video of Shane tasting Instagram foods and he says at one point something about places like this " go f a cow kill that chicken and marry ur brother " he's... I died
This house is meant for you, Shane and your future family! Shane literally lights up when he sees it! Rylands is totally excited too. Shane's mom can always visit and have her own little house in the barn! I can't wait to find out that you got this house.
Absolutely beautiful house 💚 I really hope you guys get the house! You both seem so excited!
Awwwwww. You guys!!!!!
The house in Colorado so beautiful, you can always take Shane’s mom with you to Vacay  and she  would have her own little home away from the guest house , good luck on the bid ❤️
U guys don’t move there I will
Love it!
Shane and your dad... so cute. I love your family. I wish I was marrying into your family... my fiances mom hates me lolol
Omg I DIEeeeeee that house is adorable omg u should do it. So happy for u guys!!!
That house is stunning! I love the instant good vibes and how perfect it is for you guys! When you know you know. ❤️ I just moved out of a big city to the country too and it was the best decision of my life so far!
If y'all move here I'm literally unsubscribing cause I'll be too jealous to watch.
I love this and everything I’m so happy for you guys but you cannot and me on a cliffhanger.
I think os shane wants he can have his mom live in the farm idk why not
Whelp that decides it. I’m moving to Colorado.
I hate you for that ending
PLEASE MOVE TO COLORADO I would be so happy just knowing I'm in the same state as you guys ♡
Could be wrong but double check with the adoption agency if that pond should be gated before they approve you. Don't want nothing to hinder your application❤
I love this for you both, it is an amazing place! It’s also close to family, which you all look so happy when you’re together. I’m so happy you all worked so hard to be able to have options like this. It’s incredibly inspiring and I can’t wait to see what’s in store 💙
I LOVE the Colorado house 🏡
19:36 Morgan spitting facts
I can't wait to see if you guys get it! A fresh start could give you both an amazing step to the next chapter in Shane and your lives. luv you guys!
This made me cry, I want them to get a fresh beginning. A new start somewhere beautiful and peaceful.
But seriously.... you guys should definitely get this house and definitely get married there.
Honestly I love this better then the house they have now.
Omg this is literally my dream house!! PLEASE GET THAT HOUSE, IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!
Love the Colorado house and the land is so beautiful.  I live in California but in Northern California.  You couldn't pay me to live in Los Angeles.
Why am I crying! 😭 That house feels like serenity 💕
the house is perfect ahhh. i can't believe you left us on that cliffhanger :') i need to know if you're movinggg
It’s so nice to see the relationship Shane has with Bruce 😭❤️
You put an offer on the house and… and WHAT!!! Omg I can’t wait for the next vlog!!!
OMG They are only in the kitchen and I already see them in that house!!!
Thank you for posting this. I know it can't be easy at times with the hate. But I and many do appreciate you still sharing stuff. Shane brings a lot of joy. It was hard to lose Jenna, thank you for still showing up in some vlogs Shane!

Am I the only one who noticed how cute it was when ryland said “a back up fridge for your root beer” ahhhh the relationship goals here !!!
Wow that house couldn't be anymore perfect!!
My question is what about Shane's mom? He be further from her.
Ryland how dare you take me on this emotional journey with you guys and you leave with a cliffhanger?!  JK,  love you both and hope the next video is out ASAP.
😍
I want to see future videos of them sledding down that hill in winter.  Lol
Hoping you guys get the house!!! It's the perfect house for you guys. I'm in love with it!
When this video started I thought right in the beginning “if there’s any kind of piggy, then that house is supposed to be for them” AND THEN THERE WAS THAT PIGGY IN THE BARN UPSTAIRS ❤️
Ryland the king of cliff hangers lolol Now I have to know! That house is absolutely beautiful,stunning !!! I really hope you guys get it!! New beginnings are the best!
This is beautiful!! Best wishes! ❤️
Hit the like button if you want Shane to come back…. I know i do!
You guys are looking at my dream house 💕 happy for you guys for all the possibilities
At first it seemed weird to imagine Shane and Ryland not living in California, but this house is perfect for them, I’m also jealous it’s not mine hahaha love you guys <3
Do it! You can always get a little apt in LA if you end up missing it!
GOD BLESS  GOD BLESS GOD BLESS!  The house was made for you guys. I am very happy for you guys. PS I love how excited Morgan is about her tractor.
I'm literally crying because I'm so excited for you guys!!!! Ahhh! I can't wait to see what this next chapter holds for you guys!!!!
I think shanes mom should have the upper barn
Ahhhh I hate cliff hangers! So happy for you guys though that house is a DREAM!
I honestly think you both would be so much happier away from LA and closer to family. Maybe Shane’s mom would want to move to??
I feel like you should
Leave my bb Shane alone 💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼💅🏼❤️
YA'LL GET THE GANG BACK TOGETHER , SHANE ! SHIT OR GET OFF DA POT!! LOV YA'LL MUCH LOV
Broke my finger clicking so fast 😄
Ok we need part 3 like now plz
My first drive through South Dakota - "There's Christmas Trees EVERYWHERE!" - I get it. 😆
If they dont buy this house I'm actually going to be so upset ! I can imagine how much their life would change for the better living here , it's such a beautiful house and land my dream
So fucking beautiful
I really hope yall get the house!!! Eeek!!! 🤞
Oh I love you 💕 guys!!!!   It’s really beautiful 😻
Yes! I really think you have found the perfect house! I hope you get it.
Maybe Shane and you need this , need a new place to start over……. To let L.A go. To feel free and alive and happy again
Why I miss Shane so much "that looks like the scream swing"
All the best to you both. I hope you get the house. You both look so happy there, and it seems perfect for you both.    ✌-N-💗
I really hope they get this house! I think they need the change and that house is perfect!! Just seeing everyone so happy made me happy!! Best of luck to you guys ♥️
Wait if he moves what will happen with the podcast?? 😭
I’m just happy to see you guys happy! What a beautiful home
Wow this my favourite ryland video EVER
If you guys don't go for this place, but still want to live in Colorado, I am working with a company to reconstruct a run down home and barn into a modern country side luxury dream house in Wheat Ridge, CO. Hit me up if you are interested to hear more about the details.
Them getting horses is going to be one of there worst decisions
I really hope you get that house. It’s so much better than your current house
I want that .. I live In the uk but I want that house
I"m literally crying of happiness for you guys. yay!!
I think that house is perfect for you guys.  You guys don't need to specifically live in LA, meetings can be done over zoom if necessary. You both seem happier when your close to your family Ryland. Shane seems more relaxed there too.
Idk they showed the panic room I hope they still buy it
shanes mom can move in the bar home its beautiful and she can be near them all the time🥰 i love this home for you guys!!!
Do it and get away from that whole circus in LA. Do it for both your mental health. Do the podcast with morgan (or with lizzie by videocall) and find a place for shanes mom and live happy ever after and dont look back. Ive moved away from the city to my old neighbourhood and even tho i was hesitant the peacefulness, happy people, family and nature made me feel happier than ever. I think the same might happen to you guys ❤️ good luck
Wow that’s a dream house 🏡
Wow I love this vlog. I hope yall move completely out of LA honestly. Best feelings and vlogs when you're in Colorado
Dang cliff hanger! I hope yall got it. You both look so happy there. 😊
Get the house… it’s beautiful, leave CA. New change
Why am I crying!?!? Ahhh I love to see Shane and Ryland so happy. I absolutely love love love that house, I hope you get it. Lizzie and Joe will need to live in the guest house so you can continue the podcast. Hmmmm now just a room for Chris and we are set!
Lovely couple, lovely family. ❤️
Finally
I’m worried because it seems like they don’t get the house the way ryland was talking at the very end :(
Nobody: Their dad: "And yuh got your sledding hill right here!"
I love it, Y’all look so happyyyy 🥰
I really hope you get the house! You guys deserve it and will love it more. 😌
And what Ryland?
Morgan “Matching Tractors”!
I so so badly want you to get it.
You can't make us wait another week!!! So excited for you guys!
Omg I’m so happy for you guys!!!!!
Mama Dawson and the animals can live in the barn
Put 2 vlogs in every week at least!
That’s a beautiful home from it seems so peaceful it would totally be good for you guys
Beautiful house!! Guys this would be such an amazing chapter for y’all 😄
Omg yesssssssssss
Move here!
This is soooooo beautiful. I’d love this for you guys if it felt right for you.
that house is SUCH A DREAM 🤩🤩 also, i would definitely get married there if i owned that house 🥺
Omg yes! This is so exciting!! I really wish for you to get it!
We really trust Brad. 😌
We put an offer on the house and ! Are you freaking kidding me ! Have I mentioned I have Anxiety. Omg when is the next vlog ? Love you 😍 but COME ON XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
WOW. That land is a dream!
I can see you guys living here and starting your family. you guys could do family vlogs and have your farm and you will be around a lot of family, which is always good.
And……  Tell me more 😭😭😭
I am crying !! Why is this so emotional but I’m a good way !!  I’m wish so badly that all your dreams come true !!!!   Please Update us ASAP !!!   That house is a Home !!
Omg I love love this house😍😍😍😍
I love your dad 🥺 Also I don't believe you, I know this video is totally sponsored by Brad™
what a beautiful house guys! fingers crossed your offer goes thru.
Omg buy that house !!!!
I think they should move there it's so beautiful and they could rent out there current house
so so sooo happy for you two! do whatever you desire, it's your life and you choose how to live it! you guys could change one of the sheds into a movie theatre, my stepdad owns a soft furnishings company and our home theatre is covered in all of his amazing fabrics that would look great if you guys were thinking of creating one out there, just let me know and I can ask him to maybe send you some to see if you like it. have the most incredible day, and thanks for entertaining me when I'm constantly bored x
You can tell by rylands reaction at the end that they didn’t get it
"Same square footage"
Omg that cliff hanger!!! This was amazing🙏🏼
Beautiful property! Wishing you both all the best.
I’m so excited for you and the whole family!!! 😭 two questions: 1: The Sip? 2: Ms. Theresa?

I wish I could like this more then once, LOVE so excited for them 💙
I'm loving this series it makes me have all the feels. I never seen you, Morgan or Shane look happier.
I’m so happy and excited for you guys!!
The cliffhanger!!! Aaaggghhhhhh!! That house in Colorado is a DREAM!!!
If you don’t move here Imma be so disappointed y’all’s
Glad to see Shane happy. Everyone is human and makes mistakes and everyone deserves happiness
Shout out to Brad, hear he's a great guy 👍
I am putting into the universe that you get this house, I am not all the way through so if they got it, Idk yet lol.... And also I have a new idea of a dream house! Beautiful
That home is so beautiful, peaceful and relaxing.. I think it's perfect for you both 💜
This house is EVERYTHING and so much MORE! What a dream!  I always tell people: if you can afford it, ALWAYS say YES to adventure! Especially if your gut is telling you to do it!
You two are amazing. Love you both
Aww I’m so happy for you guys 🥰
That house is stunning. From the decor to the landscape. It's a home. Wow. Good luck. It's everything and more.
"Anyone want some bubbly?" Shane: "I got some"  Mooood!
I loved seeing your dad so happy about the house and how excited he got! 😭🥺🥺
Cliffhanger!!!!!!!! Ahhhhhhh I NEED part 2
Fingers crossed for you guys. I loved how happy Shane was sounding thru out the whole vlog.
Ahhhhh 👏😭💓😁 I am so happy for you guys!!!!! This is amazing! (Sorry for so many comments, I'm just sooooo excited about this!!!!)
It looks like a place where you can breathe, feel good and enjoy life 😍😊😻! But I also love your LA house
Omg the cliffhanger!! I just don't know what I'm going to do now, I need to know.
Omgoodness! Yaaay! I hope and pray you guys get the house. It would be so perfect for you guys!
The biggest mistake you are about to make is altering your whole life for YOUR family. Shane will play along but he will not be happy in the end. Please just think about all this
I love it! Imagine the horror films Shane can write in that office and film on the land!
Omg wow at first I didn’t think Shane really was gonna love the idea of moving because I feel he doesn’t like change but Shane this would be so great for you and Ryland and imagine the family you guys will build.. freedom, privacy, and a beautiful CHEAPER view.. I love you guys hope it’s goes best and I’m excited for you looking hopeful Shane 🥰
The house is so beautiful 😍 You guys should buy it, I feel like you'll both be happier.
First
i so hope you guys get the house!!! although I might've screamed when the screen went black, ill be back (next week.?????) to find out!
I love this!!
seeing you two so excited made me so happy that i started tearing up! thats a beautiful house and I hope you guys got it!  perfect for lit. everything you would need and want!
Your dream is allowed to change, it means you are growing
It'll be a big move but that house is a home. Best of luck whatever you do 😊
Ok I gotta say this house suits you guys hope for you guys to move and be happy whatever you do :)
I literally got so emotional watching this! I am so happy for you! You and Shane deserve everything good in this world, I'm so excited to see what the future holds for you and your family!! <3
The house is beautiful. Wow.
I miss Shane so much!
UNBELIEVABLE!  Stunning beauty!  Where I live, that property would cost 20 million dollars, and the yearly taxes would kill!
I want this house
Please tell me you guys got the house 😭 you seemed so bummed towards the end of the video when you were talking to the camera
Thia has the positive energy and bubble guts we have been waiting for!! Also please put the other part up soon, if you can that cause that ending (cliff H anger would be pleased XD) ....Another video Chapter please
It's beautiful!!!!
Love seeing Shane so positive miss his videos so much......🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
Please get it!!! That’s sooo beautiful idk why but this video of the house made me emotional
morgan coming through with that hannah montana reference YAS QUEEN, i thought of the same thing!
I hope y'all move there so the baby/babies can be around your family!! Love you both!!
i love morgan's shades 💯 real cool
Also, I don't think the world be be right if Shane, Ryland and Morgan didn't live close to each other.
I wish they buy it. It would be the best thing ever. It looks like both of them.
Oh my, that house in Colorado is stunning.  Shanes mom can move to the barn loft apartment thing.  She could have her space.  Y'all could have yours.  Then both sides of the family would be in Colorado.... Except for Shane's bother.  I don't know where he lives.  That property in Colorado was breathtaking.  I can really picture y'all there.
This house is amazing.  DOOOO ITTTT.
I love a Animal haul those are my favorite😁😁😁
Watching people live your dreams ...
I love this for you both this is such a huge thing but trust me you guys will be so soooooooo happy there
My heart is full...
Awww I really hope you get the house! Wish you both the best! 🤞🏻♥️
i could absolutely imagine them living there. that house is beautiful and fits them so well! 🤍
Dump your house in LA and don’t look back. That house is perfect
Shanes mom could live in the guest house.. bring her with you! :)
oh wow, not one of the houses I thought you picked off Zillow at ALL....boy was I wrong.
We stan Brad!!!
Ryland you and Shane really are not L.A people. You guys are too good for that place. You both belong in Colorado.
Shane: "I love the door knobs❕❗" Now that is a mood lol
“at least i’m a democrat” 😭😭 i love that
OMG, please don't make us wait a week to see what happens!!! I'm so excited for you and your family!!

15:05 Ryland's dads face when talking about the sledding hill & fish in the pond!!!!!! 💓💓💓🙏🙏🙏please buy this place! YOU ALL DESERVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!
Awww That was incredible!! 😊🥰
🙌
Can't wait for the new podcast room
This house is made for you two ❤️🙏🏼
From someone who owns horses.. please for the love of god invest in lessons and maybe lease a horse at a professional facility. It’s not something to jump in lightly without knowledge of nutrition, health, equipment, breeds ect. They’re nice to own but it’s 100% harder than a dog
If they don’t buy this house, I’m gonna be pissed 🤣
Watching this video made me so happy I can’t wait to see what you both decide 💙 I can’t wait to look at houses with my girlfriend 🥺💙
Omgosh that clifhanger ending! DID YOU GET IT? i neeeeeeeeeeeed to know ahh <3 :)
Yay! Another video. Get out of CA you won't regret it. But I know change can be scary. Thanks for sharing.♥️💯
People who put in the work to learn and grow from their mistakes don’t deserve to be shoved in the dark and forgotten. I hope you guys see the support that is still with you ❤️
Your dad is the sweetest and he looks genuinely happy for you all. Love him! ❤
Need a live in nanny??
Wow! I can totally picture you living there, that house is so you!

Your family is just so cute!! I loved this video ❤️
I love Bruce, his so pure it melts my heart ❤️❤️❤️
I love your dad, and I love that we’re seeing more of him in both your and Morgan’s vids!
Excited for you both 😊 hope the offer goes through 🙏
RIP The Sip, they're moooovvviinnnngggggg (You can pretty much guarantee the house is a done deal otherwise I doubt they would have uploaded the video.)
The best of luck to you both. You all (including the family) lit up  . I can't wait to see your journey
What about Shane’s mom?
I love your whole family. So loving. This is a lovely video.
Its wild that some people can have all this when others are living in a tent under the freeway.
This house is...exquisite, my darlings. Get it. Get ittttt.
So so happy for you two and your family to be. I’m so happy seeing Shane back to seeming like him. Missed him so much and everything happens for a reason! You checking for houses that random moment then ironically finding such a perfect house for you two. Completely meant to be. Praying for your happiness. Love you guys!
Can you please just post the next one lol I need to know
It looks straight out of a scary movie but love it!!!
The ending has me on the edge of my seat!!!!
dudeee id do anything to be able to live in a nice house like that its sooo pretty!!
This is literally my dream house
Buy it.... ❤️ I can picture you all happy and growing there.. it will be a new chapter for you guys.. more positive, more love filled and happiest. Good luck guys.. love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I haven't finished watching the video but so far omg this is such a beautiful house! I think it fits you and Shane both really well! If you guys do end up getting it for real I'll be happy for y'all - I just want you guys to be happy 😭❤❤ also Shane's reactions to everything is so  cute! I hope he's doing ok right now but I'm manifesting this place for you for sure 🙌❤
July 4th was a whole month ago ryland.
Omg I literally had gut bubbles the whole time I watched this 🥲❤️
I feel so anxious/excited for this house!! I so so hope you get it!!!!
If you want to mentally heal or growth, move out of California 💀
Love your videos 💕
The most beautiful place ever you have to buy🤩🦋

I'm so excited for you and Shane! I hope you guys get everything you want and more!
But are we moving mama Dawson tooo ? Because you can’t leave her in la
that house's so beautiful 😭🤎
Shane's "I wanna live here. I wanna live here." 🤧🖤🖤🖤🖤
can you tell shane to post more please
Love you guys ! So glad you’re happy ❤️
Why am I crying at a house tour?!? This is a literally dream house 😭
I think it's Riley the one that you have to convince to move there it seems he doesn't want to leave a lay
Okay .. just to be clear that’s a pond… not a lake 😂   SO HAPPY FOR THEM
🥺❤️
That home is stunning! Hope yall take the plunge and move to Colorado full time. Get your money's worth!
This house gives me TV shows vibe!!
Okay buy it and get married there!!!!
Y’all should buy it and Airbnb it out! Good investment
I definitely think the room with the red barn door could definitely be the podcast room
what happened to Andrew??
I’m so excited for you guys! I think it’s such a beautiful house that’ll bring you guys so much happiness you deserve 💞💞 I’ve missed you so much Shane and it makes me so happy to see you so happy. I rewatch old videos from all of you guys when I’m having a horrible time and you all make me smile every time. I love you all so much 🥺😭😭♥️♥️
Move in now!!!! I love it so much ❤️
Suddenly I want to move to Colorado 👀
The house is so beautiful😭😭 and the wedding would be amazing there!!!
Your intro is soooo satisfying I literally find myself dancing every time
the house is so pretty! im so happy for you guys!
Everyone in la hates Shane if I was Shane I would move
omg i’m in love with the house. i want you guys to be happy, i think this will be the right move ❤️
Is just me or has Ryland changed.  Like his vlog style is more family  and he seems more calm and look older too  i can’t explain it  but  it’s captivating
I’m so EXCITED FOR Y’ALL!!! I see that most definitely y’all’s house. I can’t wait for y’all’s new beginnings there.
Oh my god! Scream vibes.
Congratulations you guys! Wishing you much love and happiness in this next endeavor! You guys look beautiful in that house and look so happy we surrounded by family! I can't wait to see those smiles again! I'm so excited for the next vlog!
Shane waving in the mirror, I am crying from happiness :')
Omg I’m so excited, I feel like being closer to your family and being out of LA, and being in Colorado is so much healthy for you guys mentally
I hope you guys buy!! This made me want to cry!! I want this for you so much!!
This house feels much more like a home than the one in LA
I FREAKING LOVE HOW DAD SAID "ATLEAST IM A DEMOCRAT!!" Periodtttttt!!!! we love a blue dad
The important thing is if this is what you want and need...change is good. Change is so important sometimes. I can hear it in your voices that you want to make the journey.
I've really been missing you AND Shane so much! Love seeing you both together and smiling ♥️
OMFG! I wanna live there!!! LOVE that house!!! And you guys!!!! x

The house is STUNNING. 😍 I hope you guys get it! Excited for part 3!!!
Move in already Ryland! The house is so pretty, your mental health would thrive and you'll be very happy near family. California had a toll on you, this place is so relaxing and nature hugging.
Clickbait you are not buying it
I really hope you guys get this house. It's absolutely perfect 💕

Been waiting for this vlog, so happy for you both! Love your videos Ryland and I miss Shane
it was so cute when shane said “ponies!” 😭
Am I the only one who has noticed how much Shane has grown mentally. Even just the slightest bit. I’ve been watching him for about 5 years. But in this video I noticed how he made no negative jokes about himself and he seemed so much happier. He’s thinking about growing a family and getting the perfect house. I feel so happy for him <3
This house is absolutely amazing!! 😍😍
Aghh I’m kinda early to rylands vlogggggg 💅👑🔥
Morgan: I'm gonna pop out 6 of my own  Bruce: wHat!? 😭😭😭 that is such a dad reaction lmao

“Oh, at least I’m a Democrat.” Lmao same
''OH ATLEAST I'M A DEMOCRAT'' we love ryland's dad
