I miss him being on TV
Whos here in 2025? Miss you Mr lock.
I’ve laughed so much in ages. Miss you mate X
Here we are, 4 years later and still he makes me laugh... "The tiger that went for  a pint"  brilliant!
Holy smokes he was way too young.
I know what happened now, Brian and Margaret have a card that says BeamRules on it.
When the 5:46 mark hits I get so sad. I wasn’t crying of laughter anymore
His comedy was unpredictable and effortless. God rest your soul you beautiful human being.
What! 4 years gone past like that???
I'm a little late for this, but I recently started re-watching videos of countdown. I had no idea Sean had passed away. He was my favorite character; very funny. What a shame.
A true comic in every sense of the word.................and a NICE BLOKE TOO..................R.I.P...........BEAUTIFUL SOUL.
He's the general 😂
I have never commented before. I got to know Sean Lock's comedy after he passed away, and I deeply feel the loss of it, RIP Mr. Lock.
Fk Jimmy! He wntt to amuse murderers and torturers!
4 years on, 6M views, says it all. What a legend.
Still miss him. Legend 👍🙂
❤️/🇸🇪
I've seen all of these jokes before, but they still crack me up. Funny funny man.
Genius, sorely missed .
Biggest achievement - "Rectum of the year"
Slick as an eel in the Thames
Man wish this man was still around his comedy was something special
Funniest man I’ve EVER heard
The card joke is possibly the best joke in history
biggest loss to comedy probably ever
Can’t believe carrot in a box wasn’t on here
You brought tears to my eyes with your madcap hilarity when you were with us ,and you brought tears to my eyes when you left us !! You were a genius and will be sadly missed, wherever you are  you will have anew audience wetting themselves with laughter, rest easy Sean. 😢😢
Miss you every day Sean 😞
Sean Lock will never be remembered, because he'll never be forgotten.
A genius. God bless the rapier wit of Sean Lock.
Even today in 2025  Sean Locke you live on
RIP Sean. You’re one missed funny man.
He was a champion
I discovered Sean really, really late, only a couple years ago. It's odd because I've been a fan of Jimmy Carr for, at this point, most of my life. I must have gone through a solid two hours of Sean-related content, howling with laughter and thinking "well, he's got a loyal fan now," only to see a comment remarking on his passing. It's an awful feeling and it still is.
It has been 3 years and I still miss Sean Lock. Some times I go through YouTube hoping to find some more of Sean Lock. And although I never do, what I find is always enough and always brings a smile to my face. Thank you for so many years of joy and laughter. Sean, you are missed.
I loved Sean’s humour. He could make me laugh so hard I cried. Will always miss him. R. I. P
RIP Sean. Thank you for all the laughs, even today I still watch and laugh at your jokes. That’s a challenging wank will always be my favourite line.
Even with his health deteriorating in that last clip he was lighting up the room
If I ever get to be a contestant on Countdown I hope in the numbers round they let me ask for a Seany special.
"I slept with a homeless woman once...." still a favourite.
Still bringing me laughs and happy moods today, Thankyou Sean x
“You can only get tapeworms from pork”  “How did the pigs get it then?”  “FROM PORK, weren’t you listening? You can only get tapeworms from pork!”  I still avoid pork. Thanks for the lesson sir 🫡
I watch this once a week and every time is like the first time.Simply brilliant
Rest in peace Shaun, his humour was original and his unpredictability made his stories even more glorious. A true legend.
Brilliant and genius. Greatly miss the man's talent.
I lost a very good friend and father-figure a few days ago. He reminded me SO MUCH of Sean Lock, with his being so effortlessly funny, purposefully corny and yet just so cool at the same time.   It’s genuinely really hard to lose people like these. It really feels like all the humor in the world has been suddenly stolen away. But never forget that people like these guys and gals were the ones who gave us the reason to laugh in the first place.   Stop fuckin crying and keep fuckin laughing. It’s truly all they really wanted ❤️
I hope you are still laughing mate, I am still bamboozled by tomorrow's leftovers today hahahahahahahahaha so many levels
"Set the sprinklers off" I was crying with laughter.
again
The blank RIP at the end is how Sean would of liked it, RIP, you are still as missed today as the day you left.
😢😢😢
Absolute. Friggin. Legend. RIP mate. You are greatly missed.
He is a great loss to all of us
I will tell you now Sean lock was a absolute bloody legend I hope his wife and his kids are well it's such a shame to lose him in 2021.
this is the man who made a fucking carrot in  box both funy and tense, RIP
I miss sean.
This man was a genius...love him ❤
The funniest man, l really loved his comedy. He randomly popped into my mind today and this brought me here. RIP Sean, legend  🙏🏻😞❣️
The fact he’s been gone for almost three and a half years (posting 1st of Jan 2025) makes me so sad. We still miss him!
Jailed for three weeks for no reason ? Those days are here.Sean the prophet.
My fave comedian EVER, his surreal original with was pure genius, I never knew what was going to come out of his mouth, and his mascots / children's books were utter genius brilliance! 😂
Literally a gift to humanity.
Legend!
Still hurts everytime he`s on the box. The Roar of laughter he gives me tho eases it a little bit. I do know that I`m coming from just a selfish fan`s point of view and the other comics Jimmy carr, Jon Richardson, Bill Bailey and all the Comics that knew him lost a dear fiend as well as one of the greatest comnedians ever. I am truly sorry for your loss. Rest In Peace Sean Lock, and thank you for a million laughs that we can all enjoy over and over again.
In these times of division only Sean Lock can unite people with laughter and give us all something to smile about.
What a loss!!!
So many laughs from him - absolutely brilliant. love that guy.
Exactly brilliant.
"If you could change one part of yourself, what would it be Sean?" Well, the front, obviously!" Such a unique talent to think as he did. So many great gags and stories as have already been commented, sorely missed.
I loved this man so much
Sean Lock is just a top tier comedian, his wit and humour are beyond skill and comprehension, he was just born to make our lives brighter through laughter. RIP Sean.
We lost a legend. Love you brother.
We lost Sean and then a month later Norm Macdonald. 2 utter geniuses. The world is worse.
Badly missed by many . Loved his humour ❤
“I beat Fearne Cotton” when talking about disgusting rectums is genuinely one of the funniest things anyone has ever said.
2:35 Self important prick Cordon on his phone?
The word legend is in my opinion allowed to be used to describe this wonderful man.
Not much of a tribute. I was hoping/expecting a special program.
Cut out the seal clubbing didn’t you.🙄
Such a loss
SucSuch
Pure comedy legend. Rest in peace Sean 💚
Sean Lock was a comedic genius.
Imagine Sean Lock, Robin Williams and Don Rickles in one room. 🥹
Nah, you missed the seal clubbing
ngl, this was a challenging wank.
Still thinking of you mate.
Lost an absolute legend, but only in his death did a lot of the world see his greatness, as is the case with many greats.
Rest in peace. And thank you.
So many hilarious moments it would be almost impossible to choose a favourite, so I won’t. Rest in peace, Sean.
Sean's Christmas card was brilliant. Don't know what Brian and Margaret made of theirs though 😀
I went through some really hard times , with physical and mental health over the past few years and still have  those now. Sean is the only comedian I watch who ALWAYS makes me laugh. Rest in Peace you funny, sarcastic legend ❤
I imagine James Corden can only dream of being held in a fraction of the admiration and love there was and is for Sean Lock. Keep dreaming Cordon, it will only ever be a dream, even if you could pull yourself away from your phone whilst sat beside a legend.
Really loved this man RIP mate
Legend; ❤
Fuck cancer!
The wonderful sean lock. What a gift he was.
Always remember that the somber photo of him at the end was when he was talking about Diego Matadona's rectum.
Ahhh miss that man
God I miss him.
Jimmy and Sean - best pair of british television <3
Funniest man that ever lived.
R.I.P 🤍🕊🙏♥️❤️
Without doubt the greatest
Love Sean Lock 🥲
@2:47 James is such a twat hes defo on his phone
What a LEGEND!!! This man was simply brilliant...
I've spent the last few days just finding videos of 8 out of 10 cats and countdown and have been loving every second Sean Lock was on screen. I had no idea he had passed, and knowing that makes me truly sad. I'll have to spend some time looking into his work now because he is a great comedian and seems like a great person the way people regard him in these panels. Wish I could have supported him in his life, but glad I stumbled upon his comedy.
Just found out. How sad.
He never died. We are still here laughing at his genius jokes. He will live forever in our happy smile
:16 - :24  Your damn right Sean… you’re loved and missed
Miss this man
He always made me laugh. Thank you. RIP
Watching Claudia absolutely lose it, glorious. RIP Sean. Genius.
I’ve got this in the bag! 🤣🤣🤣
As a South African, I still find British comedy the best in the world. And Sean was a master and brilliant at his job. Left us too soon.❤
Beamrules
2021 was a terrible year for comedy, we lost Trevor Moore, Sean Lock and Norm MacDonald. It was a horrible year. I was shocked when Moore died, and weeped when Sean died. When I heard norm died, I was devasted.
A genuinely funny guy and so greatly missed. RIP Sean.
Even now I still choke up. Hilarious man. Even when he did the 2 episodes just before he left us he was still so funny.
😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
I just discovered this show, RiP
My heart is insanly broken and my screen full of spittle
He didn't have cancer, cancer had the privilege of hanging with him! 🔥😘 And at the end, *it* died from laughter first! 👏😂
heres the second time im being emotional. love him and his humour COME BACK!
Genius
Genius
2 years and I still binge watch all of his clips, compilations, full episodes, miss the guy 😢
I still miss Sean Locke. From "Carrot in the box" to "The tiger that came in for a pint," still hilarious and unforgettable. RIP, Sean.
As an American whom has only become a fan of Sean over the past six years at most, it’s deeply saddening knowing he’s been gone for around two years now. He’d become one of my favorites on this show in very short order. Every time I watch 8/10CDCD, I deeply regret that we’ll never witness any new moments of comedic brilliance from him. Any man that can ruin the composure of people like Jimmy Carr and Jon Richardson and reduce them to tears of laughter is a man worth admiring.  It’s a bittersweet thing watching the show, watching him crack up an entire panel of comedians, but knowing his like is gone.  If I drank, I’d pour one out for him. RIP, Sean. You live on in every gasping guffaw and chuckle when you make me a giggling mess grinning like a mad fool. For as long as these clips and repeats remain, you live on in our laughter. We should all be so lucky as to make such a mark.
Rest in Peace legend :(
the best go  first.......such a funny man.....never to be forgoten
I still miss this man
Someone has to have added this to Wikipedia...
A massive and enormous loss to the world, he was an amazing man, he will forever shine though our hearts. RIP Sean Sir, you wonderful and incredibly brilliant man
It still hurts to have lost Sean.
The last couple of clips, you can tell he wasn't quite well by his voice.
What an absolute legend of a man ...I never knew the death of someone that you have never met before could hurt so much but this one certainly did....rest easy Sean
Sean’s death still really bothers me, more than a year later. Rest in peace to an absolute legend of comedy.
Thanks for all the laughs. RIP
I come back here every few months for a laugh, and probably will for the rest of my life
Oh wow, I was born same year as Sean .. he was much more brilliant than me thanks for the laughs you great man
The goat
We should have had 20 more years of his creative hilarity. The world's a poorer place without more moments like "The Tiger Who Went for a Pint" and his seal bashing competition.
The greatest honour was to get him to laugh. That's when you know that you might be funny
0:44
Ah man I miss Sean, miss seeing him on TV. One of the few comedians that genuinely had me sitting with sore ribs and tears running down my face. I should never have stole his glasses while he was signing his autograph.
should have used the "nooooooooo, you cant write tears Jimmy" in the end
Peak humour, and incredibly likeable. Sean absolutely owned 8 out of 10 cats does Countdown. Gone too soon.
James cordon used to be so funny
an absolute legend. Rest in Peace. ❤
Now he's just a carrot in a box...
best comic in my lifetime
Christ that guy was funny.
Claudia Winkleman is just all of us. Not being able to control the laughter   RIP Sean
Funny man amazing soul ❤😊
He's a legend. Me and my wife went to see Sean, think it was lockipedia, in Dunfermline. She felt too hot and a bit ill during the encore and we had to get up and leave... obviosly sean took advantage of this to crack jokes about how his jokes weren't good enough for us etc. Told us to fck off then.. had me laughing as I was tripping over people on the way out.
One of the funniest people ever!!
Big fan from Portugal.  RIP Sean Lock
To Sean from another Sean,  you are a fucking legend my mate ! The world's a much sadder place without you ❤️❤️❤️
RIP Sean lock 😢
Watching replays tonight. Sadly missed Sean xxx
Brilliant
Made me laugh harder than most others. Sorely missed. RIP Sean.
This man has made me laugh so hard that at times I could taste my own liver. His humor and delivery went down really well in Holland, where we Dutchies absolutely love this kind of straight faced absurdism. Dearly, dearly missed indeed!
Trevor Noah there wishing he had 1% of Seans comedy genius
Q - HOW did he die? thx
Not many peeps in my life have made me laugh so much. Rest in power you beautiful  funny man!
The world lost a rare talent when this guy died. RIP Sean Lock.
i bless this man. i loved his approach to comedy.
Farewell Sean, I'm sure parts of you are annoying other parts of the universe.
I've never seen anyone more funny! RIP
RIP legend ❤
Ive always loved the comical way David rolls the paper in a roll in the background of Seans vaucher joke.
One of the Best . Dry as they come .
Doesn't matter how many times I watch his clips, he cracks me up. Still can't believe he's gone.
TOSS POT...
RIP. You legend cunt.
Miss this bloke. Never met him but all the same he left a real impression on me. A real comedy legend.
What a way to end 2022 watching Sean lock
Pure genius!
Merry Christmas, Sean you tosser XxxxX
Still sad every other day over losing what to me is (was sadly) one of the very few embodiments of Humour AND an amazing man AND inspiring AND just the uncle you always wished for. It's sort of comforting there's still all this footage... :( / :)
Rear of the year with the gloves off lol
His dry delivery could not be replicated!  His house coming out of lockdown every morning - cracks me up every time
Hi Channel 4..  I need your help.  I have been looking for a bit Sean Lock did that was sooooooooooo brilliant! .. but I can't find it!!   He was on Cats Does Countdown and sang love songs from when he was kid... they were in the style of the 1940s.. (the joke being that he was so old he was alive back then.).    I remember he was in a dark suit jacket, he walked in front of the panel, and sang 2 or 3 of these old timey songs and one of them began with him starting with "Maaaaauuudddd" .. or Maud.. and the audience  just died laughing!    I am sure that was in seasons of CDC 18 or later.   It was brilliant!  (Reminded me of an old character done by David Alan Grier in America.)   Could you point me in the right direction to finding this?    (Or you could make a video of this??)
RIP FUNNY MAN. LOVE YA WORK
That such an amazing talent is somehow allowed to escape from our existence. No truer definition of tragedy. God Bless Sean. God you will be so missed..
Not only was his punchlines funny but the spontaneous creative narrative that lead you to it.  Genius.  Rest in Peace Sean and thank you for bringing so much joy and laughter to me and so many others. You are dearly missed ❤🙏
I've literally only just found out the news now.. a year later 😭  I'm angry I didnt know sooner 😟
Watching Claudia trying to breathe,while pleading with Sean to just stop talking just rules.
I’m in the US, so I don’t get to watch episodes of Cats very often. I just found out about Sean, can’t believe I didn’t see it in the news. May he Rest In Peace, a lot of nights where I couldn’t sleep I listened to the show. Such an amazing man, I hope he’s doin well upstairs
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Absolute legend 👏 🙌 💙
He won't rest in peace. Ha ha
I have know idea how many times I have come back to watch this, but i'm sure Sean would consider it inappropriate.
Watching "Rectum of The Year" story with Claudia's laughing was the best thing ever! Sean was pu comedian to make guest celebrities laugh as uncontrollably as we were at Home! My fave comedian by far, and I have most of em as shite! Genius! It's a lot for Joe Wilkinson to carry as NXT best! And Sean's Fave! 🤣🤣👏🙌🙏
Sean, you will be missed. Taken before your time, that quick wit will rarely be matched.
❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
RLAI., what's that? I've askeed before, and got an answer, I just can't remember what it is:;
Man, I was sad to find him so late in life. He is just brilliant. I love his humor so much that I had to look him and watch some of his sketches.
Sean Lock = LEGEND! A five minute tribute is an insult, but thanks Ch 4. RIP Pal x
i didn’t even know he passed, this video isn’t long enough
I used to watch the 8 out of 10 clips a lot but I find it difficult to now be honest 😞
RIP absolute legend
Sean lock a comedy legend, we miss you Sean 😢
"Challenging wank" will always be his funniest moment for me.
😔
What a guy x
Life is shite, but death is shittier. :(
No doubt ...
What a gem
It's been a year. I started watching 10 cats and other shows because of him and I stopped after his death. Not to discredit other guests. But he was a galaxy and half ahead everyone else when it came to being hilarious. He was  the favorite comedian s favorite comedian. His dear Florence love letters is hands down the best written proof of how gifted he was.
RIP - A True legend!
Laughed until the end. Beautiful personality. Amazing comedian. Missed so much
What was wrong with the seal clubbing joke???? That was just as funny as the rectum of the year award.
I cant believe I'm just hearing about this now. I'm in the states, but I loved watching him on Countdown and 8 out of 10 cats here on YouTube. What a loss 😞💔
He was my favourite I looked up to him watched every episode of a show from a country unfaimliar to me beacuse of him... I never felt hate towards a "year" as people usually say...but god damn I fucking hate 2021.
Sean as a state of mind
"This is rear of the year with the gloves off"
Legend
Fuck cancer. This amazing man had me laughing and crying on more than a few occasions.
I have discovered the brilliance of 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown few weeks ago, fell in love especially with Jon and Sean and their endless antics. Today I discovered the world have lost Sean Lock a year ago. Still feel devastated. A true legend. May you rest in peace Sean, your humor will be missed greatly.
"There's a challenging wank" was one of my favorites.
No matter how many times i watch these videos of mr lock they always have me in stitches! RIP
:(
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
'That's a challenging wank' is still my favourite
Sean "the breeze" Lock
God this world is so much darker without his dark humor in it.
Just the funniest guy ever - RIP
Rest in peace, you've brought much joy to my life during lockdown!
The world was just a better place with him in it.
I didn't know ç_ç
I only liked this for Sean! Channel 4 can stuff it!
Bit weird, but I had a dream about Sean the other day, He was chuft to bits because after he died he got his own island and he can now march round all day now pretending to be a pirate, woke up laughing , bit odd sharing that but hey the guy was a genuis and made me laugh loads.R.I.P
Anybody else still missing him? I know I never knew him personally but it makes me sad that we’ll never get any new brilliant material or quotes from this legend.
There are not enough words in the dictionary, but tarmac and flannel are. RIP
Just a wonderful comedian he made it look so easy.
Such a low key delivery, but absolutely hilarious. Still can't believe he's gone
Absolutely loved Sean's humour it's so sad we lost him R. I. P SEAN LOCK
Are the mobo awards a real thing?
Jeez that was a sad shock. Love to all his family.  Rest in Peace, Sean xxx and Thanks for everything.
Poor Claudia
So much love for him legend
Must say that this is top ten comedy I've seen. Regardless what I've previously said of Sean.
A week ago i discovered him, bingewatched his stand ups, and i just found out and googled if he's really dead. Im upset 🙂
Funny Man - RIP x
I refuse to say goodbye to him. Maybe we can clone him or something, surely they must have stuffed him or preserved him some other way
Naturally funny man who just happened to be a brilliant comedian, Your Truly missed Sean by all..
Noooooooooooooouuuu.... Aaaaaaahhhh. NOooooooooooo.   You can't write tears, Jimmy.
WHAT A GUY X
He was so damn funny! Heaven is laughing harder, today.
One of the funniest men to have ever lived rest in peace sean lock
5:54 :-O OMFG I did not know! I was just becoming a fan of him. What a waste!
Honestly miss the fact that no more new jokes will be thought up by such a genius of man and comedian. Much love Sean. RIP xxx 😇
Love you man, sorely missed..
Still crying from laughing, sadly missed, sweet dreams Sean and thank you for  bringing laughter to me when I'm feeling low.
I've put this off for 7 months, because I didn't think I could handle it. Great video, I've been crying and laughing, and then crying and laughing some more.
Legend
Absolute legend. To early sadly missed
Funniest man ever. Still devastated at his loss. Keep em laughing in heaven mate
Still can't believe we lost the "carrot in a box" master so soon.
We lost so many legends to covid and I never realised that he was one of them.  I’m really sad that I won’t see him in future shows.
You know Sean was hitting the jackpot when even he starts cracking.  I just heard this last week, through watching random Youtube videos and I'm appreciating how sad it's making me for how beautiful of a comedian and person he was. In this strange little internet world he made my pandemic a lot less miserable.
RIP mate. U were amazing and u are missed.
Wish I had been taken and not him.
I laugh everytime he opens his mouth.
Nutty as an fruits cake. Sadly missed. 😂
Well, what did he remember?
Sad that Sean has passed, but HOW LUCKY is it, there's so much material. Can only feel Blessed, and Thankful, a lot of Joy. Scott Loch., na, Professor Bandit 650i.B.T.E. out.

Rest in peace. What a true legend.
We will feel when Joe goes I loved Sean ❤️
I can't see a Christmas card without thinking "merry Christmas you pair of tossers" absolute legend
Oh my goodness. I'm Canadian and I had no idea he passed away! :( RIP Sean. You brilliant, hilarious man. <3
Nooooooooooooooooo Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Such a cracking guy.
God Bless him   I hope he runs riot in heaven
Wonder if Jon was sceptical at his funeral thinking ‘is he really in that box?’ After losing both times at Carrot in a Box
What a legend such a funny guy
F
Thoroughly enjoyed this great mans quick wit and style of comedy. Thank you sir! Fan from New Zealand.
I live in the States and only found this show and Sean Lock close to the end of 2020 during the quarantine. All of you who knew him and knew of him longer - I'm jealous of the time you got to spend with him. What a funny, funny man. Brilliant, inspired comedy and absolutely terrific delivery. I wish I'd caught onto his stuff sooner. Still so very sad about his passing.
RIP Sean, the ultimate comedian's comedian
Brilliant! Love his humour. I’ve nearly pissed in me pants from laughing, seriously
Man’ll be missed.
i was just enjoying a good ol Sean Lock videos session and at the end of this one, RIP???? WTF this fucking hilarious man died?? my word, so young ... him and Norm MacDonald were (and still are) some of the funniest guys ever, to me. If there is a heaven, please let me be able to listen to these guys when im dead.  Thank you for all the laughs Sean!! I hope you do have a full mousetrap when you get home ;)
His voice in that last clip 😢
cancer and covid taking to many of my heroes lets tell it to fu// off we had our shear
It's a nice tribute, but it should have been longer.
God bless Sean…I feel very sad to have lost a great human being and brilliant comedian…God bless you!
I’m italian and i love this man
I’m from the States and came to Sean’s party a bit late, but Rest In Peace you hilarious specimen!
Exactly what I was gonna comment,his humour was so random the stuff he came out with and yet pure genius R.I.P legend
A true gentleman.
Whaaat?? I didn't know he died I can't believe I loved his mascots on the show an absolute legend
Peace be upon a clever comedian. I enjoyed him immensely.
Its been months since Sean Passed and I miss him on Countdown and in general. RIP you grumpy old bastard!
His comedy was untouchable, Along with Rik Mayall, Sean Lock is one of Britain’s greatest achievements.
Real knows real 😉😉i'm not gay but again id like to say one of the greatest of his generation while been one of the most under rated 😎😎😎😢😢😢😢 dude watched him for 30yrs not a bad show love ❤️ man
Jimmy adored this guy. It's so clear to see he finds everything he says hilarious
Such a brilliant man.  He will be sorely missed.  The show always made me laugh, and part of it was Sean and Jon.  Such comedic instincts, wish I could think so fast like that!  RIP Sean, from a fan in Florida in the USA.
RIP Sean Lock, you were amazing.
Just been watching clips of Sean the past few weeks and then I found this clip and it ruined my day
HOW DID I ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS TODAY!! i was wondeing why so many guest captains were on lately :*(
so much missed, have a tear in my eye today, crying with laughter at this video.  RIP Sean, you fantastic man
He was one of the funniest people on earth!
A man taken far too long before his time. Rest In Peace you legend
I'm no less devastated now than the day I heard the news. Gutted
An absolute legend.
HE DIED??? Are you serious??????
To Brian and Margaret,Merry Xmas you pair of tossers haha,I'm done 🤣
God, I miss Sean Lock ❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
He left this world too soon. Rest In Peace Sean.
I can't believe he rubbed out, what a funny bloke. One of the greatest comedians that england has had
RIP legend.
This man saved me from depression. Now that he's gone, I feel like I've lost a beam of foundation. However, Sean stayed true and resilient to the end. As should I. Thank you, Sean. You will live forever...
Sean reminds me of Eustace from "Courage the Cowardly Dog", especially when he's talking about dogs like "Why would you kiss a dog? Fuck is the matter with you?" RIP Sean.
loved sean lock was so funny r.i.p
Bless him. This man was fuckin great RIP🙏🙏
We love him so much
Some of these have literally made me laugh harder than anything else in my 37 years. The "slowed down for a horse" line gets me every. fucking. time.
What a comedic legend Sean Lock truly is, the Comedian's comedian, makes everyone laugh. Not even a shock comedian, just someone that you wouldn't expect to make you laugh, but he does. Genius!
I miss him :’(
R.I.P, Sean....
The man was a LEGEND! Rest in Peace Sean Lock - two-time, undisputed, undefeated Carrot in a Box World Champion. You will be missed.
Legend
Always came out with jokes that are unexpected and original. Never knew where he'd end up when he started talking. Diego Maradona's rectum set off the sprinklers. The world is a less funny place without him.
Comedy legend 🙌🏻
The man was hilarious. And he could just keep going.
We miss you Sean! You effortlessly brought laughter to millions, love you 😂
One of my favourites. R.I.P.
I didn't know that he passed away recently. Rest in peace, legend.
Hello god it’s me. You can have every tiktoker in exchange for Sean back. Yours truly, Margaret.
Thank you Sean
"if I could reanimate everyone of the Nazi party I'd place them on their own personal Island"  -Sean Locke
I tried to thank Sean lock for his bit about crossing a road and getting fully treated to the abuse of an aggressive driver or person,,,, I had an almost identical event that left me shaken and long term unnerved,, I think of Sean lock's account of his experience and it makes it better,,, I only wish I could have conveyed that to him before he died.
RIP, discovered him recently watching 8 out of 10 cats. Loved his humour. I will always remember his Carrot in the box and “challenging wank” brought tears to my eyes. You will always be remember
I’m thinking of you and your family this Christmas, Bless you all,,,,,,,,,,
You are deceased
Comedic Legend. R.I.P.
Never thought I’d be so heartbroken about a celebrity death. I had no idea he was even ill. He will be missed ♥️
He was  funny as rest in peace ✌️✌️
Much loved much missed
Britain's leading animal cruelty humorist.
Always impressed by comedians who can be themselves in front of comedy royalty Trevor Noah
it will never be the same ... thanks for the tears RIP
Just heard, (expat in Aus) Rest in peace Sean, never again will there be a seal clubber who can swing equally well with both hands.
"So don't barbecue it you cock". I've been applying this to my life and it really works.
I keep coming back to these videos because I have a lot of time for Sean, even tho he’s passed. I will never forget him, even from the grave he continues to make me laugh. RIP Legend.
RIP Mate! now, heaven will have a taste of your Countdown Cocktail.
The funniest man there's ever been. The perfect comic.
Tell me they got his eulogy right.
😪
Beamrules is simply the best joke rip sean
I miss Sean Lock. May he rest in peace.
Very special, a huge loss.
The funniest.
Everything except Trevor Noah is great about this video
We miss you Sean what a genius
We'll miss you & your words! (Sat 04 Dec 2021 17h55)
Biggest achievement in life I avoided the tax man 😂
God bless absolute ledgend
One of a kind.
Sean Lock dying.... nobody will replace him.
Claudia's hysteria gets me every time!
I had to stop for a minute after “coming home to a full mouse trap”
Sean will live forever in Jon head
Claudia Winkleman's reaction is such a beautiful tribute to Sean
I Love comedy, from Pryor, Lee evans, Bill Burr but no one has made me laugh and cheered me up throughout the years more than Sean Locke R.I.P to a true Legend of his craft.
Leaving out “that’s a difficult wank” this a shame. RIP you legend.
:( sad he was a well like peculiar comedian = sad didnt relise he was 58 ... he looked like 40s
See you on the other side Sean!
He was the Anchor man of this show
God I miss him so much ❤️
Carrot in the box GOAT....I'll also never get the image of him hanging "brain" when he did TV heaven, telly hell.
Gwyneth Paltrow sandblasting her rectum..  Thats the one I aiways remember from Sean. R.  I.  P.
Arguably one of the greatest UK comedians of all time.   There's not a lot of comedians that have the ability to command and dictate a room full of other comedians like Sean could. Personally not a lot of comedians could make me cry with laughter like he could.  I've never really been truly bothered or upset when a celebrity passes, whether I was a big fan or not, but hearing that Sean had passed really affected me. We'll never get to hear a quick witted rebuttal of his, or one of his ridiculous takes on a subject, or an outrages answer again, and that's sad.  RIP to a UK comedy legend.
International treasure
What a talent, amongst all the horror the world has to offer, we have this gent, truly amazing, love and respect to his family.
Shame on the people who didnt like this montage. Sorry. Not shame. Cunts is what I meant.
a comedians comedian..
Nooooooooooooooo Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  I didn’t know about his death till now, god what a lose in not only the world of comedy, but the world in general. I hope he lives well in whatever place he went to with his carrots and rectum of the year award.
Such a funny man. Gone way too soon. 😔💜
Comedy won't be the same without Sean lock. Always remembered
They say you should never live life with regrets, but I do regret never seeing his stand up.  Such a funny guy.  His reverse centaur is mental
Lovely tribute!  Man, he was SO funny!
Not fair
So funny Sean rip mate.
Simply the best laughs all round when ever he was on RIP he will be sorely missed
Still can't believe he's gone 😢
We’ve lost a comedy legend in Sean Locke .
RIP Sean. Thank you for sharing your legacy with all of us. The world is a cruel mistress when we lose people like you, but thank God we live in a time where you're never truly gone.   I'll see you around on YouTube, old friend. In the meantime, rest your weary head.
So sad that he passed..such a loss
One of the truly funniest men to draw breath.
"Can't write tears, Jimmy."
What a wonderful funny man…….I would watch this show just for his opening lines and mascot…..so so fun R.I.P. Sean
It’s just cr*p that he’s gone. Such an utterly funny and unique  man.
RIP Sean Lock you hilarious man
I never thought I would miss Woking... And I dont
God I miss that genius so much. Such a lovable funny man. RIP Sean
I'm so upset rn just found out 2 months later he passed. I'm in tears. He was my fav on this show. I'm from NYC  And havent been keeping up. This fuvking sucks. RIP Sean. 💔🖤🖤🖤🖤
Only five minutes. This man deserves a whole hour.
You can't write tears Jimmy. RIP Sean, you'll be sadly missed xxx
Not the best comic out there but made a living don't know why jobs for the boys I think
The beamrules segment was pure genius  Nobody else would have thought of that  RIP Sean
Rest in peace Goat
Such a shame this man is no longer with us.. they’ll never be another quite like him RIP..
The world is now a sadder place. RIP Sean.
First Norm Mcdonald, now this hilarious, irreplaceable  and not enough words. Just found out. Too young to leave us, only 58. RIP big guy. Make the angels laugh from now on. :(
So sad to hear about his passing.
My favorite bit was when he ate an entire serving of whelks on 8 out of 10 Cats. lol. RIP, good sir.
RIP legend
If Sean had been alive to see how much people appreciated him and his humour, I bet even he would have started crying. He was in a separate league and elaborated so graphically on his jokes, a marvellous man.
Thank you for all the laughs.
Rest In Peace. Thank you for making my days just a little bit better.
Much missed
What a guy, what a loss. RIP Sean, we're far worse off without you.
Sean was truely a legend
Fcuking genius
You just assume someone like Sean will always be there - one of the few comedians who could get me into fits of laughter without hardly trying. There'll be that much less laughter now that he's gone. RIP you absolute legend.
Aw. That's sad news. What a loss.
As an American, I only discovered Sean Lock when news was posted on YouTube of his passing.  Curious about him, I started watching clips of him.  In the end, I watched everything I could find, more than once.  I am so sorry that he passed so young.  What a brilliant talent.
Beam rules.  Priceless
I came across Sean Lock through 8 out of 10 cats a few months before he sadly passed n am thoroughly enjoying going back n watching old episodes, his stand up's n the two episode US cowboy + swamp tour with Jon Richardson. He will be sorry missed. 😔🙏💙😁
Man, I just heard about his passing today. He was a legend and will remain so, especially when it came to carrots in a box!
RIP Sean. Thanks for all the laughs
Complete fuckhead. miss him already.
you missed the one of Rachel dressing up as a viking with a horned helmet and large beard and when she finished he said, " Thats a challenging wank" brilliant, he cracked me up with his humor and was one of the best, what a shame, why does he upstairs take the best from us and leave low life alone
Comedy Genius.  One of the best. RIP
Wouldve loved to be able to thank him for all the laughs. i hope he was happy; he gave so much of it. Will miss you Sean. RIP
Truly missing that guy.😢
I won't spit on you when we have sex tonight😂 Sean, too soon...too short... And Too F* Funny❤️✌️
When I watch this stuff, I wonder why I can find black-and-white TV shows on my US broadcast channels but I can't find options with this guy. I prefer the BBC over Hollywood (it's not British vs US, those are fake divisions as far as I'm concerned).
i might be a aussie but comedy is international. R.I.P Sean
The world is always a darker place when we lose another bright light - you’re one funny bastard Sean and will be sorely missed by all, condolences to your loved ones and to all who loved you, let’s raise a glass of “water “ in your memory 🍻 cheers mate
Legend.  Makes me cry for all the good reasons.
I know what my grandad would really love for Christmas, a chance to host the MOBO awards 😂
Rest in peace Sean Lock. Sincere overdue condolences to the Lock family for your loss 😞
Great man. Loyal Chelsea fan to make him even better. RIP Sean.
I suggest look for fast hair growth fortified shampoo.
R.I.P 🕊🕊
So sad we lost him.
Few weeks have passed I still can’t quite believe he’s gone. Feels a bit strange knowing we will never get to see Sean again. Best comedian in my lifetime
A word of advice: research no sulfates fast hair growth shampoo.
His comedy will be missed. May he rest in peace.
An amazing talent.  He had me in stitches on 8 out of 10 Cats.  His humour will be sorely missed
His voice has really gone at the end
"you have to stop speaking" because laughing so much, wow :D
But will the Chinese understand this kind of humour ? I don’t think so. Made in England with a face that shouts “  piss-take , banter and   humoristic brilliance. RIP ? I don’t think so . I will miss you Sean.
'Coming home to a full mouse trap' 😂😂
I so loved his humor!
What a great guy. Love "the tiger 🐅 who came for a pint". RIP. Funny man.😀🙏
So sad he's gone  He was a comedy genius  Hard act to follow
RIP! Genuinely the funniest and most quick witted on the show. Lots of love and prayers to the family
No matter what hell always be rectum of the year
He fought he lost And now he rests  Ser alliser thorn
RIP Sean
wonderful
Did 8 out of 10 Cats actually do something for him on air?
Bloody brilliant. R.I.P sir you will be missed.
One of the funniest men that ever lived! Not just funny, but he was relatable because he wasn't a stuck up celebrity, but a normal, humble man.
rachel laughing while reading seans card has to be one of the shows most golden moments for me
How is anyone disliking this video?
This is the first time I've felt grief for a celebrity death.
Sean lock wat a man a brilliant comedian much missed rip top man
You could never underestimate the genius of this man . RiP Sean your be greatly missed
Legend. Rip.
❤️
“That’s a challenging wank”
Always mad, always funny, always one syep ahead with his wit. Such a shock to lose a genuine comedian. RIP Sean, loved your humour.
Roisin is having affair with Jimmy Carr that's why she is in the show more than other celebrities
what a legend, I left uk in 2004 sort of missed him being famous, but i always loved him before when he rarely turned up.
203 thousand people like that Sean is dead???  Thought it would be higher tbh.
Sean was a humble facist Jimmy but just too you no one else . He was an enigma off a comedian .
Absolutely one of if not the funniest comics I’ve ever seen. So so sad RIP
Gone far too early. Absolutely brilliant mind.
RIP Sean Lock you were a wonderful comedian and person
so sad so many gone so soon. cancer spares none, in the end.
Imagine being one o the 749 people who gave this a thumbs down... No...Me neither.

I can't believe I found out this way. Seriously heartbroken 😞
OMG just heard. I still can't believe it. Hope you didn't suffer too much...you were great. I'm from Belgium, you'll be missed, even here in Middelkerke. You would certainly cracked a joke about that. My best wishes and condolences go out to your wife and kids. You couldn't shut up about them, could you, bastard. Sean Lock, one of the greatest...all my love....hope the UK will never forget how good you were. Also the QI people...hope you are all doing well and friends and family do too. 💞💌💝💖
Oh wow, just found out that he died through this tribute. RIP you magnificent bastard!
You know he's a well loved comedian when there are zero dodgy youtube comments and thousands just loving the man for being who he was -  absolutely hilarious and genuine good dude.
Omg I didn't know he died.
Rest easy, you hilarious great man.

Wasn't allowed to get to 60yo :(, fk off Cncr.
Missed
Never did anyone made me burst out laughing loudly.  And never did any celebrity passing make me feel like I lost a relative and a friend.
RIP, I miss you already :(
First time I've cried over a celebrity passing away. Never forget you Sean Lock and you will be missed immensely
Rest in Peace <3
744 people disliked a tribute vido to a man thats died ..... shame on them thats a disgrace. R.I.P sean u were bloody hillarious
R.I.P miss you lots
RIP mate. you have made me cry of laughing many times.
Never have I gone so quickly from crying from laughter to crying from grief.  Thank you, Sean Lock.
Wasn’t funny and now he’s dead. Oh well
743 people have no soul... This guy will be making god laugh his ass off
Hi. from a swede... Always waiting for Sean, was it eight out of ... or what ever. I feel sorry, will miss him.
Shame you couldnt string something more thought out, seems as intern and glued together as any of the other clips you have. One of the UKs shapest and top comedians. Cheers Sean
❤️
Rest in peace, you legend. Never seen a finer man eat so many whelks.
You can't unsee James Cordon staring at his phone while Sean cracks open a can of water ..
The world truly lost a legend. Rest in peace Sean, you will be missed.
LMAO.. !! Amazing comedian.. RIP.. lots of laughs 👍🙏❤️
Sean really made me laugh the real kind of laughing that has you creased over struggling for air.
Oh sean..😔
A sad loss, what a guy 😢😢 👏👏👏
You set the sprinklers off too, Sean!
RIP
Rest in piece you wonderful genius
Bless you Sean Lock. You will be missed.😢 Condolences to family and loved ones.
I've just remembered "The Riddler!" he must have been roasting hot in that suit but to pull out of the hat that final joke! pure genius. loved to watch him on QI as well as 8 out 10 cats... I think the next cat I get will be called Sean Lock in his honour!
one of the biggest regrets in my life is never seeing Sean Lock at a live gig! God bless his memory and his family with funny & happy memories of this comedic genius, the like of which we’ll never see again!  I just think of the A-Z casserole he made and Miles Jupp spoon feeding it to him!
😭😭😭😭😭😭 I loved Sean Lock! 8 out of 10 cats does countdown will never be the same without him! 💙
Very funny  man we will miss him
Biggest loss of the century
I love him. I always binge watch him when I'm feeling low and it makes me happy. I didn't realise how popular he was with everyone. I'm completely gutted that he's gone. I honestly can't think of another comedian that I've liked as much as him. I actually cried when I heard and I never do that with famous people.
Watch this show here in Australia,what a great loss,R.I.P. mate and condolences to friends and family.
Literally, the very night before his passing i was sitting with a mate, watching him and we were both saying just how hilarious and brilliant he is.... next day, the news he was gone.  Absolutely gutted...  Rest Well Sean .... Like a Mouse in a full mousetrap, as it were <3
It won’t be the same without him 💕
RIP :(
RIP
Cats countdown won’t be the same without him. Legend.
I was floored when I heard about this.
RIP legend ❤️
Who will now make jokes aboutresurect the nazis, put them on an island to fend for themselves? RIP, undefeted carrot in a box champion!
Repose en paix ! Une légende de l'humour
Cancer can go penetrate itself in the behind. If anyone has a plan for murdering cancer I’m in! Rest In Peace Sean. Wonderful tribute Channel 4 <3
Just really sad
Piss funny bloke who will sorely missed. Old school humour
RIP Sean...
RIP lovely man, condolences from the millions of fans to he’s family
RIP you legend Sean Lock.
A comedy genius, I still can't believe it
A real funny guy. RIP Sean.
I wish I could tell Sean, thanks for all the laughs and happy tears.
God dammit, Sean. You were one of the people on my "List of People Who Should Outlive Me So I Don't Go Crazy On This Stupid Planet".   Carrot in a Box was just epic.  And "Here comes Jimmy the Feeder" kills me every time.  RIP.
Damn it, I didn't know until seeing this video that he'd passed on. Genuinely funny man, a delight to watch. Sure to be greatly missed.
One of the most unique comedians ever.  Truly irreplaceable.
"Nooooooooooooooo, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, nooooooooooooooooooo!"
the people diliking this video are still in denial that he passed away
"Coming home to a full mouse trap" 🤣🤣
I was heartbroken when the news spread. Genius comedian. He’ll be sorely missed in the UK. Kept his illness very quiet. Always the professional. RIP Sean Lock. God bless your family 🖤
That's how man becomes immortal!  Share words, that even when you are no longer here, your words can be felt tingling in their bellies!
RIP Sean
they all suck ....pls stop you not funny
Why is everyone dying
He does what ?
Is there a previously overlooked small body of water in Scotland that can be named in honour of this man? Failing that, a set of gates on a waterway somewhere on the Norfolk Broads? I am sure he would have appreciated either as a fittingly monumental tribute.
How is there even one dislike on this RIP Sean  never failed to make everyone laugh
Sean Lock-a man so funny he made Jimmy Carr laugh like normal on most occasions.
Few comedians as witty and funny as this man. His delivery and timing were impeccable. What would we do without people like you who make us laugh so much? RIP Sean
Rip brother
I can't beleive he's dead. I just found out about him a couple of months ago, fell in love with his comedy straight away
Rip xxx
Rectum? Don't even know him!
Now Jon Richardson can never beat him in Carrot or No Carrot and I want to believe that would have made Sean Lock extremely happy.
I never found funny. He died far too early. Greatly missed.
Very talented man, had no idea!
Whilst the purveyors of deception make alot of money with these videos let us not forget the many cancer sufferers who have died or are not treated because of  the covid scam that is reinforced by said channels.
Thank you Sean Lock, you made me laugh so many times specially on 8 out of 10 cats. RIP
This man has made me laugh so much, like genuenly laugh until i'm hurting. Thanks Sean!
Dang. I didn't know he passed. I'm usually a guy that's hard to make chuckle, much less laugh, but this guy was like a comedy ninja that would just randomly dip in next to you and shank you right between the ribs. Godspeed you lovable munster.
Let's face it... He's just on another level. It's like this show was made for him. Utterly brilliant.
That rectum of the year joke was side splitting. Sad to hear he's gone.
A comic genius who was a comedic supremo. Taken too soon. R.I.P.
"Hot tarmac on a vet's flannel"
Completely irreplaceable 💔
Just this morning I was singing "if you wanna get a tapeworm eat some pork" under my breath and giggling to myself. I'm so saddened to know this comic genius is no longer with us. RIP.
I loved his humour bless him.
It’s sad that it is only now he isn’t alive that I am listening to him- clever humour and light heated to all he seemed
Sean Lock made my life better. R.I.P legend.
❤️❤️❤️
nice one bro
A lose beyond measure! A truly great Comedian. I raise a toast to Sean... May he not be forgotten.
RIP buddy, the Nazi island joke is the best!
I’m late in watching this man perform, but I’m glad to see it. RIP
RIP you legend
I've never cried or been as devastated by a celebrity passing as I am now. Just found out by trying to look up if there is any new content about Sean. He was the most brilliant comedian. Needless to say I do not live in UK so the news travelled slowly to Northern Europe. RIP and my condolences to everybody whose lives he has touched over the years.
As have many, been watching lots of these clips videos and generally laughing and thinking ‘Sean Lock is amazing’ but the stark reality of that final still frame really hit home.  Thank you to Sean and the best of wishes to all family and friends.
omfg i didnt know he dieddddddd :(((
RIP Sean
I remember an 8 out of 10 cats episode where someone bought him a bottle whisky, throughout the show he kept drinking it. After about quarter of the bottle Jimmy was like "I'm being told in my ear 'someone needs to take that bottle away from Sean'"
Thanks for making me laugh RIP
Huge huge huge twat. No, huge huge loss. Genius comedian. In the true sense. :( bye
Such a funny lad... RIP Sean 💙
0:05 Too bad he had to sit next to Trevor
what a legend
Goodnight Sean, you’re gonna be missed❤️
He made me laugh so much, bless him. RIP Sean.
Sean’s jokes feels like a punch out of nowhere, Can’t see it coming until it hits you in the gut, with laughter
R.I.P To the cutest comedian of all time  🙏❤🥀🕊
Gutted by Sean's death. What a marvelous man with a marvelous comedic genius. A sad loss for the human race. He brought me, and my family, many, many moments of side splitting laughter. RIP Sean.
RIP you utter legend! 🙏
I only just heard the news now, I'm properly upset, loved his sense of humour and he provided me with many laughs, you will be missed Sean
Rest in peace Sean 💔
He's literally making them cry with laughter at the end.
I never thought I'd miss someone I'd never met, but God to I miss this man and his wit and talent. RIP. 8/10 Cats won't be the same without you.
Sean isn't pushing up daisies, he'll be sprouting 2 carrots. RIP big lad.
RIP Sean.
there is so many more legendary clips of him that make me howl with laughter  just shown how amazing he was
RIP Sean, 🙏
Fucking legend
I didn't even know he had died until I saw these trending videos on YouTube. Sad news.
Rest In Peace
Do you think that Peter Cook and Sean Lock would have been friends if their ages matched?
oh no ... gonna miss his unique style of humour ... couldn't watch him and remain quiet if life itself depended on it.  "Do you like the letter or the numbers Sean?" "Well, that's like asking if you wanna be mugged or burgled really."
I loved Sean gonna miss him so much..
Tears of laughter.. Sean you will be missed. 💗
never forget on his tombstone he needs it to say OOOO NOOOOOO! you cant write tears jimmy.
Wow, A great man gone to soon! Sad to hear that we will never hear Jimmy and Sean bickering again, 😅 like an old Married Couple those two  R.I.P legend hope your at peace, and your Family is doing well, you were one of the best!
This had me crying 😢 hilarious and so sad.
R.I.P
5:35 to 5:45 - Claudia and Jimmy's laughter - that's how great Sean was. RIP.
Seans gone and Alan Davies is still walking around? How is that fair?
Legend.
RIP sean a one off .You would smile just looking a him, a mind of laughter he shared with all of us
He once said my last words will be "You cannot bribe Pigeons"
He was incredibly hilarious! RIP you will be missed by many!
Oh no! Is Sean Lock... DEAD?!?!
RIP Sean Lock, the "Carrot in a Box" champion and a mascot extraordinaire. You will be missed
Legend
It just wont be the same without you.
It wont be the same without you in all the comedic talk shows and games. RIP
Rest In Peace you legend you brought many laughs
RIP Sean. We'll miss you.
“You can’t write tears, Jimmy.” R.I.P. Sean. You’ll be sorely missed.
rest in peace sean. “i’ll tell you what. i won’t spit on you tonight when we’re having sex” made me laugh the hardest i have in a long time
These Sean Lock videos are the only ones that take from an lol to a tear at the end.
aah man, i loved this guy. no comedian quite like him, a real treasure
RIP Sean Lock
😔
Hang on... Has Sean Lock died???! Please, no....
Literally didn't know he existed until I happened upon an 8 Out of 10 Cats video. Then I fell down a rabbit hole of watching him. He made 2020-2021 a little bit brighter for me. Rest in Piers Morgan's eyes <3
RIP Sean.  Thanks for the laughs
So sad you can hear his voice getting weaker in this clip. What a fantastic bloke, a tragic loss. His comedy will live on.
A soul will never walk this earth again with the delightful scent of hot tarmac and a vets flannel
It is so sad seeing that Sean Lock has passed away. R.I.P. my friend.
'Now there's a challenging wank.'  Sean Lock at his brilliant best.
💙💙💙💙rip Sean
This man's comedy was truly like no other. Incredible. R.I.P. Sean Lock
You know you're good when even a bunch of comedians don't know what's coming! 😂😂

May this legend forever rest in peace
R.I.P.
Out of all the recent loses, this one hurt me, I even remember how years Sean Lock has made me laugh,prayers going out his family, and millions of friends. How still not really wanting to believe he's gone. Sorry for my selfishness Sean. RIP
Rip to one of the funniest comedians I’ve ever watched or listened to. Lots of laughs, Thank You Sean.
💔
"I beat Fern Cotton"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The ending. I just got to know he died. Fuck, that took the big, ugly, laughing grin right off my face. I can't believe it. WHAT a WIT, WHAT A MIND! What a shame... Gone too soon at 58. I will always regard him as the best of the best improvisational comedians. SEAN LOCK, YOU LEGEND, rest in peace! <3
Today is the only day sean didnt make me laugh
RIP through YouTube I got a huge Fan of 8 out 10 cats does countdown here in germany and reading about Sean Locke really shocked me, for me he was an essentiell Part of the Shows charme

7 billion people on this planet and Sean was the one that made me laugh the most. And laughter is surely one of the best things in our lives. Loved him, tragic loss, RIP Sean.
My throat hurts from laughing. One of the most intelligent stand ups. Goodnight sir 🤣🤣😂😂😭😭😭😭
Really enjoyed his comedy and whit, it’s too bad that he went so soon.
Wait he died!? 😭
Gutted…  What a funny bloke, the world is that much duller now he has gone.  R.I.P Sean.
I do not want to be the dude that makes the decision of who to put in Sean's seat on cats does countdown, not gonna be the same without him 🥺
Oh Jesus! I thought this was a tribute in the sense of every funny thing he’d said through a season  I didn’t realise he’d died :’( a great loss
Finally had some money for booze. Cheersed him with some Stella as I can't find Strongbow in this shit town.  Thanks for getting me through some of my worst depression, sir.
Finding 8 out 10 cats so late is a shame. Sean Lock was truly magnificent, may he rest in peace
Same age as my mum who suddenly passed last October! 58 in no age to go and to pass from a disease he had already overcome once; there's no words to convey how sore his passing is and how much he will be missed. My heart truly goes out to his partner and children. May they look back on all these hours of footage with pride and happiness in time; may they know that he will never be forgotten or that the laughter he created will never end. Xxx
What a tremendous loss , he will be missed, a true genius
Still.pouring one owt for the greatest original honest and to the point comedy of life. Genius, Sean lock . remember you forever. Rip
i love this man. RIP brother.
Do you ever show your sensitive side...  Ive shown it twice...Once for my wife and another time I slowed down for a horse

watching 8 out 10 cats with Sean , jimmy and guests was a great help though the lockdowns.  thanks for the laughs and distraction. rest easy..
As a Canadian, I first discovered Sean when I came across QI on YouTube in about 2007.  I’ve been a fan ever since.  RIP Sean,  you will always have a huge impact on comedy.  You were truly talented and hilarious.  Your presence will be missed for years to come.
Rip King your a legend
I was devestated when I heard the news I've watched this show from the very beginning and 8 outta 10 cats. It's so sad RIP to a great funny guy 🥰
Why why why is it the best of the best that unfortunately die 😔 So sad. Rest in piece Sean 💔 x
The man was and is a comedy legend and in my opinion the last of the great British comedians, no one will be like him
"I wouldn't normally with water, but it's so watery, I say cheers".  Cheers Sean.
An utter legend.
RIP
Unique & irreplaceable, such a one off comical genius with an unrivalled & hilarious dry sense of humour, still can’t believe he’s gone! RIP Sean you legend mate
Very funny and clever man, thought's with his family and freinds.
A unique library of laughter. Immortal.
What an absolute genius of a man with the ability to bring laughter to everyone.. These videos will last the test of time 💯 RIP Sean 🙏
Thank you for your genius comedy Sean. Fly high and Rest in Peace 🙏🏻
Clubbing seals and fishing with Goebbels in heaven. You’ll be missed Sean.

legend
who could possibly dislike this?
I am sure someone has mentioned it before on this thread but if you haven't watched "15 Storeys High" then well worth a watch if like Sean Lock's stuff. One  of the good ones  Sean was,
RIP Sean Lock, a true comedy genius!!
Where can i get tickets to his next stand-up show ? :-)
He works hard to be funny so he can make people smile and laugh... let's not forget that. Commiserations to his family and friends.
damn bruh what the fuck. rip.
Thank you Sean Lock. Condolences to his family and friends. I'll keep laughing, for him I had a few minutes long moment of silence for him at the end of the video. I couldn't help but think of a joke in his style, so in honor of him, I'd like to give my go:  Gave a moment of silence for the Sean Lock tribute video. My hostage chained in the corner however, didn't. Rude.
What 683 arseholes disliked this video?
One of my favourite comedians along with rik Mayall both passed, rest in peace to both of you funny fuckers, cheers for the laughs.
God rest your soul Sean, my husband and I always said you were one of the most naturally gifted comedians we had ever seen, we enjoyed so many laughs x
Rest in peace you seminal, unique, household, cross generational comedic ground-breaker   We owe you a debt than can ever be repaid
He will be hugely missed 😢😢
The thirsty giant phenotypically box because scene minimally stop across a careful geometry. mute, angry mother-in-law
Devastated. This man was the Riddler! Legend.
Jimmy Carr cry laughing says it all.  Such a loss.
Hey, at least he saved money by smoking...
Cant believe I just found out who this man was and to find out he is already gone. Its might be too late but you have a new fan. RIP Sean
Condolences from Italy. I've been watching panel shows and following Sean in particular for more than 10 years, I'm 26 now and Sean's comedy and humour shaped my personality in ways i can't even fully realize. I'm deeply saddened by his passing and i want people to know how important he was to many of us from all over the world. RIP you cute beast.
They cut out the seal clubbing part of that clip at the end??? That was brilliant
Thank you Sean!
RIP Sean. You will be missed by so many.
Crying with happiness and sadness simultaneously. Brilliant stuff.
Hot tarmac in a vet's flannel.....because you're worth it.......eau de Sean Locke.
“That’s a challenging wank” - said by the most humorous man on the planet
R I P Sean
Wow I didn't realize he died :( I loved him and his dry humor
R.I.P. Sean  Heaven just became a happier place
RIP beautiful mind and we will miss you on rectum of the year but will be remembered every year. 🙏
He seemed the sort of guy, he gave everybody stick, maybe that is why he was limited in tv work, the luvvie leftist establishment did not like that.Remember on show after ahem Carrs' tax affairs, he did that brilliantly but not totally going over top.
A wonderful amazing man just pure genius xx
RIP Sean Look
One of the best, may he live on forever through his amazing content :-)
I don't know how this news escaped me until just now; on seeing the title of this vid I thought it was a bad joke...RIP Sean, can't believe it. You've made me cry with laughter so many times 😢
Where's "I won't spit in your mouth"?!
Who on earth dislikes this video?
I didn't know, the world is a darker place without this God of a Man. R.i.P. Brov
🙏🏽 Rip Sean
What? He died? What? Noooooooo
Thank you Sean .. RIP mate.
For me Sean's death really hits home we were the same age
:(
Legend of a man. Rip Sean Locke.

Who the hell gives a thumbs down on a video about a recently passed person who’s done nothing but make people laugh.
Sean Lock is the entire reason that I got into watching British shows like Countdown and 8 out of 10 cats. I still remember the compilation video of him on countdown that made me sit there crying laughing and I was instantly sold. Even though that was only a short few years ago, Sean Lock has become one of my absolute favorite comedians, and I will sorely miss his comedic stylings.
I can’t watch the video. I’m from the US I only know him from the panel shows and only for a couple of years at that. The moments that come to mind immediately watching him lose it during  Joe Wilkinson’s naming peoples penis poem, eating the whelks and him and telling Miles he wouldn’t spit on him during sex. Obviously many other things got to me as he caused at least one stomach pain inducing laughing fit every time I watched him.
My favorite comedian and my goto for a belly full of laughs when I need it. A huge loss.
RIP Sean comedy Genius 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Watching this was so bitter sweet.
he was always a delight when he was on the show.. I enjoyed his humor and I know, he will be missed..
Just found out and my heart broke. Way too soon. Most funny man I`ve seen. All the best to his family. Love from Denmark
RIP Legend.
RIP you’ve done so much that the world has become a better place because of you
goodbye Sean Lock. you were brilliant
Look at corden on his phone at 2:38. Why do the producers let them do that?
Rip brother you made me laugh so much on my darker nights xxx I hope you are at peace and not in pain brother god bless you for all the happiness you brought to people xx
Ever since I first saw Sean on 8 out of 10 cats about 7 years ago, I fell in love with his brilliant, unique sense of humour. One of the funniest people to ever have lived. You will be sorely missed, Sean. May you rest in peace. <3
His absurd sense of humor made reality so much easier to deal with. You never knew what he would do!  I am genuinely sad that he is gone.
Shame, shame, shame. What a really funny, quick thinking comedic talent. RIP Sean ; I will miss you. But thjere will be replays (lol)
Hold a can of water, pour down a good ol pint. Theres no other than the almighty Sean.
Sean lock, gone but never forgotten. A man who bought so much laughter into the world now leaves us with his final gift, our memory of him, a true class act.  R.I.P Sean Lock
Thank you Sean for the laughs. Especially those ones about Jimmy's tax. That was classic.  RIP Mr. Lock
im not entirely sure how to feel: devastated or upset, or perhaps both. sean was to comedy what shakespeare was to the stage, and i dont think anybody could ever replace his fantastic humour and charismatic personality. hoping that his next life brings him joy and happiness
Didn't he once, at least once, mock the death of Margaret Thatcher?
I can't believe he died
Loved watching this guy over the year. Such a great comedian. Very genuine. Very witty.
Best one he said here was you want some cottage cream and some jam referring to if Micheal Jackson owned a shop
A quintessential comedic mind and persona.  He seems like family in the best sense of what that is.  You know it's coming by his face, and he's thought through his entire delivery in the instant just before.  Love everyone's comment remembrances.  TY Sean
It would be nice to have an explanation for some of the jokes. Being an American I believe some of the comedy is rooted in the British culture and popular culture. Seemed like a great comedian.
he died?!?!??! nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Comedian for comedians
Sad news, a great comedic mind now making the heavens pee themselves laughing...:) RIP 🇨🇦
NNNNOOOOOOOO!!!! WWWWWWWHHHHHYYYYY??? NNNNNNOOOOOO!!!! AAAAARRRRRRGGGHHH!
What sort of comedian does it take, to make other comedians BEG him to stop being too funny?
Super, super funny man. How he could keep such a straight face, while I'm being forced into stomach-hurting eruptions of laughter.....hats off! He always took it where it needed to go.
Thank you so so much for All the laughs and smiles over the years you truly will be missed R.I.P Sean ❤️
I want to "like" this video a thousand times. You'll be missed by a lot more people than you probably cared about
Jimmy Carrs bleached teeth are so white, that the radiation gave Sean Lock cancer
Did he die? 🙁
Classic Lock. Had me in tears of laugher.
R.I.P to a legend, one of the funniest people on the planet
A god so shit he has gone bad bad thing love him
Thank you for all the laughs. R.I.P Sean xx
Miss you Sean. The best at combining decency and inappropriateness.
Whaat he died??
You hilarious bastard. I'll miss you & I'll never forget the countless times you've cracked me up. Rest in peace Sean. One of the realest ones out there <3
He's still the reigning champ of "Carrot in a Box". He's a legend. 👍🏽
5 millions views in a week maybe  Tribute alone and shows just why and how well thought of he was. A brilliant comedian and great  person   That Brian & Margaret sketch will ever get less funny
I just found out he died... that's sad. I don't follow British comedy all that much but I loved his content... wish I could have met him. RIP
We'll miss you Sean. Thanks for the years of laughter.
Rip comedy genius
Wow
Rest in peace Sean, thank you for all the laughs.
Yeah I’m absolutely gobsmacked when I knew that something was wrong with him
Always remembered never forgotten. RIP Sean.
😂🤣 such a funny man. R.I.P, hope he is forever remembered for laughter
Rest in peace, no matter how down i was he always made me laugh.
I hope channel 4 replay all of his countdown episodes
What a superb man. I was crying with laughter by the end (not the Rectum of the Year end, the end end).
RIP Sean - thank you, we'll miss you x
R.I.P. Sean Lock. Your humor saw me through so many hard times in my own life. You were always so magical in wit and humor. Thank you. God's speed.
Love that guy. Hilarious. RIP ❤️❤️
Fuckin love you Sean Lock.  R I P you funny gentleman...
Sean Lock: I got the worst Christmas present ever, ever in my life. My sister gave me a "Grow Your Own Luffa" kit. Stephen Fry: God bless her! Sean Lock: It was a clay pot, a bag of earth and five seeds. And I think the clay pot hit her hardest. R.I.P and goodbye Sean Lock. I'm devastated.
❤️❤️❤️ On Behalf Of The World Thank You For All The Smiles You Made Come True You Will Be Missed But Never Forget May Your Soul Sore To The Heaven's And Your Body Sleep Peacefully ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful man. And now he’s gone. F*ck.
YOUR FUCKING CALLED BO-NO ALRIGHT!!
I still reckon that him referring to Rachel, in a bushy beard and a Viking helmet as, "a challenging wank," is the single funniest thing ever said on '8 out of 10 cats.'
Legend.  The show will not be the same again. The way he made us laugh will last forever
Thank you Sean
:C <3
Rest in peace you absolute legend, you're sorely missed
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A total legend and actually I think it was the best comedian ever in my opinion R.I.P thanks for the laughs
Legend!
What a man.
Sean Bustin Jimmy balls about his tax scandal first came out is the work of Genius.
He was amazing.  Fucking Shame.
going to miss legend
Gave me so many laughs and in part one of those who helped fine tune my humour, legend, R.I.P, you have given me laughter to last a life time
Ahh he was glorious RIP funny guy 💙
Absolute legend! Will be hugely missed.

RIP Sean, you had a fantastic sense of humour.
Absolutely funny man always made me laugh ,  thanks for all the laughs Sean  :-D  Godbless and R.I.P
Funny guy man. Rest in Peace bro! 💚💚💚
I was always disappointed when I tuned into the show and Sean wasn't on the panel. Such a funny man.
I wanted to play Sean Lock in his bio pic but I lacked his warmth.
Ah really. Sean's gone? Sympathies to his family. xxx
Claudia Winkleman is about to pass out at the end... RIP Sean Lock.
Nooooo… whyyyyyyyyy… nooooooo… arrrggghhhhh…  You can’t write tears, RIP Sean
RIP Sean, comedy gold. What a legend.
remembering a person who only just passed isnt for the memory but for views... this is disgusting and wrong, respect the man insted of expliting his death...
Rip you absolutely adorable loveable genius of a man. We were lucky to have you ♥
A unique voice in comedy. Will be sadly missed
R.I.P sean lock another person gone who didn't take life to seriously you will be missed sir
Brilliant man, a great loss 😞
hilarious legend!!
This is such sad news.  Here in Aust. we get re-runs and though they may be a few yrs old, he quickly became my favourite TV personality.  Cheers mate, it hurts to know you're gone but you will never be forgotten. Much love to his family and friends
Never heard or seen this man until YouTube suggested a video; now I am sad to learn he passed from cancer, but by Odin's beard he was hysterical. May he make the angels laugh as much as he made us saints & sinners laugh.
The money I embezzled from the RNLI has me crying every time.
I love comedians and Sean was one of my favourites.  If I could gift him a year of my life, i would. Always loved, never forgotten ❤️
Thank you, Sean. So many smiles.
RIp 🪦
"This is rear of the year with the gloves off!" HAHAHAHA
He simply wasnt funny. I only laughed once, and that was because he died.
bye sean,all the sympathies to channel 4 and anyone without a sense of humour
What a truly funny man. Rest easy chap.
Brilliant - just brilliant!
rest in peace man you brought everyone joy
May this lengend rest in peace!!❤️
That moment at the end when they are laughing to tears and begging him to stop! xD So fricking good!
Genuinely  funny man unlike most of the crap nowadays.
rest in peace sean lock
brilliant comedian..... trust C4 to erase the section about seal clubbing between the the RNLI and rectum of the year skit - political correctness gone mad - shame on you C4 - Sean you WILL SO be missed!!
Bloody legend mate
Rest in peace you absolute legend. You've brought me to tears from laughing so hard countless times, and now I'm brought to tears by your passing.
Comic genius in the truest sense of the word. Many a Friday night laugh thanks to this man✌️
Still gutted over seans loss...man was a legend...
In order to get into heaven you’ll have to beat him at carrot in a box, if you lose then you’re sent to hell to play carrot in a box with him forever.
man was pure gold
you can hear in the some the clips his cancer you can hear how it is changing his voice. at 4.33 minutes you can clearly hear how the cancer is affecting his voice very sad in hindsight. amazing man i think. may he rest in peace.
Fuck I'm going to miss him... another of my hero's gone... :(
Thanks Sean. The ONLY person who could make me actually laugh out loud. Loved you. xx
Such sad news 😞 Thanks for the laughs Sean..8 out 10 just won't be the same without you..R.I.P 💚

RIP sir what a LEGEND! 🥲
Wonderfully bizarre, you never second guessed his thought process.
I'm going to miss him :'(
You know what gets me the most in this video? The difference in his voice between 4:25 & 4:33. That was the moment the lump appeared in my throat. Goodnight Sean, sleep easy.  "I hear voices?" "Do you?" "Yes, but I ignore them and keep on killing."
rest in peace
RIP. :(
Help Im a small carrot stuck in a box,,,
Sean Lock is best described with a 4 letter word DEAD

I just found out Sean Lock died and quite frankly im broken to hear about this. Ive been watching 8 out of 10 cats does countdown every night before i go to bed. This makes me depressed.
Hey folks…  The complete series of both the radio and television versions of ‘15 Storeys High’ are available on the internet archive.  I’ve tried to post the links but YouTube keeps deleting them.
RIP you legend :( Much love from New Zealand
Such a brilliant comedic mind. A very clever man and extremely funny. So sad to see this news. He will be missed.
I thought this was just a compilation video of his stuff.... Damn that ending hit me like a truck
RIP Sean Lock
The bumpy barometer thirdly land because cannon increasingly continue about a nappy education. black, utopian ounce
I’m an American that loves his comedy. Truly saddened. I pray he knew the Lord.
Sad now, happy I was able to watch his genius.
What do he mean by "slowed down for a horse"?  R.I.P.
Am a Shanghainese girl. Sean is my favorite British comic. RIP Love from SF Bay Area
only time I have felt genuinely upset over a celebrity death . So sad to think there will be no more Sean jokes . No one else like him at all :(
RIP you crazy, confusing, hilarious man. Devastated
Can’t believe we lost this amazing talent. Gone too soon tbh.  He always made me laugh on Cats Countdown and Cat and I will certainly miss his humor.
Wow.. I live in the states and am surprised I didn't hear about this. He was a great comedian! RIP
He is, lovingly, such a cute.
I don't think I've ever seen anything as funny as the BEAMRULES bit
A funny bloke that you could have a pint with, great, missed but always remembered...
I genuinely cried on the day, I’m a 30 y/o married man with a family
How dare you guys not include the Nazi Island :D
Will be sorely missed. A very, very funny man. Vale Sean Lock.
Rip Sean, Given me countless laughs over the years.
Sean Lock was so funny to watch and 8 out of 10 cats won't be the same again.
Fantastic comedian xx
"When he bent over,  it set the sprinklers off"  that line makes me giggle lots lol.  Rip sean

RIP Sean
I never knew him but I loved him! Thanks for the LoLs and for being so serious all the time. 😶
Goodbye Master of Dark British Humour.
RIP the man who made me laugh harder than anyone
Absolute genius comedian. Wonderfully lived, and very sadly missed.
Last clip if you know!😢
I loved that man. He had one of the most amazing comedy brains, and never failed to make me laugh. He was a man who could make anything funny without any preparation. Just the best.  I hate having to write this all in the past tense. RIP Sean.
Noooo what the fuckkk Rip
Your comedy for me through some tough times, thank you Sean ❤️
2 of Sean's best ideas ever were #1 To bring the Nazi's back and put them all on a deserted island and #2 The low vis jacket.  Sean I still laugh at Joe's penis poem but your reaction to it is the best thing I ever seen on TV... Thank you for the laughs.
What a amazing man the Sean was the delivery of the last sketch was brilliant I don’t know who he came up with it all
He was so funny, RIP Sean I didn't know he had passed away thoughts are prayers with his family and friends 🙏
We will all miss you Sean. You fucking genius human being
Jimmy Carr wrote the perfect reply, how can you type Tears?
Rip you will be mist
I can’t believe that he’s gone. Comedy has lost the best comedians of all time.   Rest in Peace Sean Lock. 😭🙏
I am completely crushed. Absolutely love this ridiculous person.
What a guy!
From the Netherlands, thank you for the laughs Sean. You will be missed.
🥲
RIP Sean, a true comic genius.
RIP and god bless
Gone to early and will be very sadly missed by all 😥

Watching this pissing myself with laughter what a guy 😂🤣😂🤣
What a shame I didn't even no till I seen this 🙏 funny bloke 😔 . Why is it always decent people go early.
Anyone got the clip of sean when he puts his hand on his head and pretends to have a fringe?
I always feel bad when someone passes but when Sean died I was absolutely fucking gutted. One of the funniest men on the planet in my opinion and one of the few comedians I've seen live. Tge world got a hell of a lot duller without his wit. R.I.P x
oh my god this hit me SO hard. Rest in peace Sean Rest in PEACE.
Wont be the same without him
RIP
He is cute <3 RIP to an absolute legend
RIP. You’ll always be remembered by your friends, family and all those people who enjoyed your work.
An English Gentleman with the driest sense of humour, will be very sadly missed, rest in laughter Sir
I loved his comedy. Gonna miss seeing him.
I haven't even heard about this. Laughed all the way through this then the rip at the end ripped the fucking soul out of me. He is one of my favourites. I can't believe it.
Did he die within 28 days of a positive test !?
top  funny man...rest in peace mate.
612 comic geniuses mark this down…
Really love Sean locks classic comedy ways. He had me crying in laughter on many many occasions. Have all the dvds related to him and his comedy.   RIP SEAN LOCK REALLY HOPE YOU MANAGE TO MAKE GOD CRY WITH LAUGHTER JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DID EVERYONE ELSE IN LIFE.
This really hit me hard, I thought he had beaten cancer from a few years back... Gutted to lose such an amazing talent. Enjoy your next adventure mate, wherever you may be.
I only discovered Sean 18 months ago but I binged on everything I could find. A unique and very funny sense of humour. Goodbye Mr Lock. 😥
Did he have a popular experimental gene therapy procedure recently by any chance? Just heard this as i dont watch tel lie vision
🙏🙏🙏 ur so amazing and complicated and you are a sensation and you smell of hot tarmac I love u and in tribute of you I will come home to a full mouse trap 🪤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Unique mind, absolutely great loss for us all. RIP Mr.Lock.  :(
Loved every second, most of it crying with laughter.  Devastated.  RIP,  Sean.
Legend of comedy.
Found out about the show and Sean when YT started randomly recommending it, Sean was always a bit unique in his humor, I really hopped this tribute was to honor him becoming 50 years old or something like that, alas, RIP.
RIP Sean
Which absolute fucking bellwhiffs have given this the thumbs down? If you don't like Sean fair enough. But why watch a video of him?
RIP Sean
So sad, he’ll be remembered!
My Heart is Broken>
I feel blessed to have witnessed his genius, he NEVER failed to make my belly ache with laughter.... Truly ! x
Nonce
I can't believe he's gone. So sad.
A beautiful man will live forever ❤
Oh my.. RIP
Bless your soul, making people happy and laugh is a fantastic way to live your life, bringing happiness to people x
Great comedian loved his humour will be sadly missed, made me laugh many times  sad to see him go so young. Shock to say the least,  his sence of humour was incredible love his jokes love the man. God bless you Sean lock.
Always found Shaun hilarious, best one on the panel by a mile. Thanks for the laughs mate x Rest in peace
Amazing person, Unrivaled talent... RIP Sean. Cheers from the states.
He was a genius...What a loss...Very Sad !!!
Sean always seemed to completely confuse and delight Jimmy. Jimmy gave some great, genuine laughs there.  RIP in pepperoni noble funnyman. We're all poorer for the loss of the comedy you gave us. F.
Absolutely gutted to hear this - it just won't be the same without you. RIP Sean
Why not the "I won't spit on you while we're having sex tonight" video, I love that one
Rip you absolute legend! 💙
There was no1 that made me laugh harder then Sean his comedy was so unique and he will be missed by many. Fuck Cancer
Obviously a tragedy for his family and friends, but as a comedian he just wasn't funny at all. The paper listed his 10 best jokes......not one of them was funny. Not a patch on the older comedians.
You made us so happy with your hilarious comedy Sean.  God Bless xxx
loved this guy, a comedy god. made me laugh loads when some times i didn't think i could  ❤️
Just a legend. What else can you say.
My favourite episode was when Sean sat next to Miles and ate whelks. You'll be missed Sean!
I wonder
Whoever downvoted this video is devoid of the concept of pure joy.
I'm seriously laughing and crying at the same time ffs. Very sadly missed already, a real GEM.
Thankyou Sean Lock, rest in peace xxx
RIP Sean Lock, thank you for all the laughs and you will always be remembered
R.i.p
RIP Sean. I still feel a bit shocked? He was just so young it seems u fair. Thank u for making us laugh all these years x
Rest In Peace to a brilliant man. You will ever be forgotten! Your jokes brought all of us a ray of sunshine such through awful times, and I hope you’re resting easy. Always made my day when 8 out of 10 cats does countdown appeared on the TV. You will be missed so very much. Thoughts to your family as well x
RIP great Sir you will be dearly missed. Thank you for all the laughs and some of the best moments ever.
RIP Sean - you were and will always be my favourite comedian
o man he was one of the few that could acctualy make people around him cry from laughing..jimmy cried few times because of Sean...best one ever was "i wont spit on you tonight when we are having sex"  jimmy just lost it...
Fuck, I just found out. His comedic style was so unique; I always enjoyed watching him. He'll be missed greatly, by his family most of all, of course, but by many more as well.
So much love for sean lock, hes my favourite comedian who does the rounds on the panel show junk, when hes there its always such a positive uplifting form of comedy.
So sad he died so young. Bless your heart Sean. You always had me in stitches.
I’m gutted, rip dude
I live in Los Angeles California and only got to know Sean through YouTube. He always made me laugh even on days where I felt I couldn’t. He will be greatly missed.
Funniest man I've ever had the pleasure of watching do comedy. RIP Sean, you'll no doubt continue making future  generations laugh with the comedy gold you've left behind ❤️
Just the worst news.
58 o my god
A brilliant dude 👏
Loved his middle aged cranky man persona, and his stories were awesomely funny.
I was in shock when I found out about his passing.  Thank you so much for making me laugh. You will be missed. You were one of a kind.  Rest in Peace.
Thank you Sean, thank you. X
why is this man getting a tribute just because he remember something ??
"That's a challenging wank." - Sean Lock

I love that he specified any ADULT relative, the restraint was hilarious.
This is so so sad - the world just lost one of the greats😩 Rest In Peace and thanks for making the world a brighter place.
The one comedian I waited so long to see and lock down stole it from me 😭. What an absolute legend he was, will always be my favourite comedian. Jealous of those people who knew him, he seemed like a top bloke.
To a man who truly left the world a better place than when he found it. RIP Sean 🙏🏼
You will be missed by all who knew you and all of us who don’t! God bless you Sean Lock.
RIP Sean. Thanks for all the LOL's. <3
NOT FUNNY!
We will miss you😮‍💨😭 but… you left us with alot of good fun memories❤️
Sorry to lose you, Sean.
Fuck me. He's dead. He was a fucking hero. Fuck...
First I saw of Sean was on that comedy show with that really thick girl who worked in a chicken shop in one episode and in an episode where he plays a customer in a fish spa shop and the dumb girl gets piranhas instead of the fish you're meant to have in a spa.
RIP :(
legend. RIP.
What? I cant believe he died, he was my all time favourite in youtube. Loved his humour
Unique and irreplaceable. Made me cry laughing numerous times with his humerous brilliance and again when I heard the sad news. It is just wrong that he has gone. Thank you Sean.
Channel 4 ,4 million views, 4 days ago
We lost another Legend  RIP Sean.     Ya were the star ae Countdown 😊❤️
Looking back its obvious he had been doing chemo, but the way he just shrugged it off and told some of the best jokes of his career despite his personal life is pretty amazing,
Stay away from the cigarettes, folks.
only annoying thing about this is jimmy car's laugh
Sean was one of my favorite comedians. R.I.P
A comedic legend, RIP Sean

RIP Sean, you were amazing...
Loved him for years. Such a funny man and a true gentleman!!
Was wondering why suddenly there are videos of Sean popping up everywhere, clicked on one and then found out he was gone. RIP Sean
Can't believe it thoughts are with the family and friends. ❤️💐🙏
Lost a lot of bodily fluid watching Sean through the years, thankfully mostly out the eyes. Gonna be missed in my house for sure, R.I.P mate.
What kind of miserable, self-worthless people down-voted this?  I hope we all get the chance to review their pitiful lives one day.
One of my all time favorite comedians, actually sad he passed away. I don’t have that to often with people I only know from tv or internet. I’ll miss him and I’m sure he’ll be missed by many others. Thoughts go out to his loved ones.
Bless ❤️ a true funnyman 🙏⭐
R.I.P Sean Lock, an absolute Comic Genius 💜.
I can’t believe he’s gone! 😞 RIPSean
Such sad news
rip legend
Legend

RIP Sean Lock… too young, too soon, too hard an act to follow.
❤️❤️
What a waste RIP
Rip Sean, sad you're not going to be on countdown anymore. Best tv clip was carrot in a box one
R.I.P :(
Thanks Sean!
Genius, legend, unique and so ****ing funny.

​

I always had a secret crush on Sean Lock 👀 genuinely gutted
😞
The funniest 6 mins of television I've ever seen. Just crying with laughter. RIP Sean you will be sorely missed
I never used to think to Sean Lock was a comedian on the panel of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown. I just thought he was some regular nerdy contestant from the proper version of Countdown that Jimmy let on the show for a laugh, but he was actuals funny
Such a loss to the world.
Man I only just heard about this. Im devastated. RIP Sean, one of the best ever mate.
RIP! Absolute legend ❤
The humdrum thrill unquestionably sneeze because lunchroom molecularly answer despite a unadvised margaret. whimsical, unnatural relish
God speed Sean.
This video is how I found out he passed away :(
Very sad rip 🙏
GOD SPEED THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME LAUGH SO HARD
Just found out he’s gone. Loved his comedy and loved the man…
Sean Lock. Legend.
Rest in peace Sean. X
Fuck, he's really died?! I thought it was a joke. Damn, you'll be missed Sean.
Rest in peace you legend
Sean is now in the arms of Jesus.
I love this man :(
Going to have to wait to watch this. Too raw still
Comic genius, rest easy sir and make them all cry with laughter in the next life 🙏
Absolute Legend! ❤
What an absolute genius comedian. A completely original, quirky, surreal and hilarious performer. Extremely sad that this world has lost him.
I'm from the Philippines and Sean Lock's Humor has gotten me through a lot of difficult things. Thank to you Sean Lock, Rest Easy <3
Such a comic legend, they just don't make them of such calibre anymore. RIP, you will be missed by the nation and beyond
Bless his heart and wit!
RIP
❤️❤️❤️😂🥲
Finding out what happened really stung in my chest. I watched so much of Sean Lock over the years, from full episodes to compilations and had many laughs, I wish his family only the best.
I feel bad for admitting that I didn't know who this guy was until when this was announced. RIP though!
Fantastic genuinely funny man - who will be very sadly missed by many - always made me laugh
See ya Sean, going to miss you
RIP You were always my favorite to watch.
such a huge loss
A man who knew the secrets to comedy make the punch line some think unexpected. Brilliant I love playing carrot in a box.
RIP
He was utterly and totally in a class of his own....RIP
I’m sorry he died, but I personally don’t think he’s that funny. But then, comedy is very subjective.  Sleep well Mr Lock.
I will actually say, Sean Lock was my number one fav comedian. Such a shock. My fav bit was "guess whats in my box", if you have seen it you know the one.
I’ll never forget as long as I live.. Carrot in a Box (the first one)  Everyone involved with 8 out of 10 Cats will be grieving along with the rest of us. Go well Sean! ..thanks for the laughs and being such a genuine guy to be entertained by 🥳
Sean lock, an absolute genius and will be missed by so many. Never failed to make me laugh. rest easy mate
Thanks for the laughs Sean. RIP.
Bless this hilarious beautiful man.. RIP Sean
😢😢😢 Very sad news RIP.
You can see the love jimmy had for sean
A toast for the legend he was.
Wait, he died on the day of my birthday? How did I miss this?  RIP Sean
RIP you absolute legend!
I'm so sad x
My condolences to his family. His sense of humor was the best. All the love from Russia
So love this guy. God speed Sean x
No one got Jimmy laughing like Sean did.  RIP Sean and thanks for the laughs across all the years x
Ok, who the fuck thought they could dislike this?
Rest in peace Sean lock 1963-2021
Thanks for all the laughs Sean lock you will never be forgotten
No "challanging wank" joke? buuu
This man was a legend. Watching this with tears because he was so brilliant. R.I.P Sean, you will be missed
Sean Lock was legitimately one of the funniest people on the planet.  He never failed to brighten up my day and even after his death, the jokes he's left behind will continue to bring us joy.
Thank you Sean for all the laugh… All of your fans from all around the world will miss you… rest easy Sean, my thoughts and prays for Sean’s family…   A fan from Indonesia
A wonderful comedian who will be greatly missed. God bless you Sean.
Be laughing and making laughter wherever you are good sir
Never heard og him, but I wish I had. It seems he was a genius ❤️ Rip.
Rest In Peace Sean!
devastated to hear about this. He was the comedian to make other comedians laugh
The parched gym contextually detect because hearing operationally improve anenst a breezy toy. deserted, precious description
I can only assume the 583 people (at time of writing) gave this a thumbs down because they thought it mustn't have captured Sean's best work. Or perhaps they're best described in the dictionary with the letters C,T, U, S ... no E. Sean was brilliant. Legendary.
Sad, sad day. True comic genius. Quickest wit I’ve ever seen. ❤️
RIP legend. Thanks for all the laughs!
My brother passed two years ago and I buried him with an onion based on a 10 year old inside joke. Believe me when I say no disrespect but I pray they buried Sean with a carrot. Or did they?
Dude... found this man through "Carrot in a box" ... Thanks man and if anyone out there thinks they are funny... watch him and enjoy !!! RIP
I love how Claudia was just destroyed.  LOL.   RIP funny man.
thank you Sean, you'll be eternally missed.
I really hope Sean and Maradonna continue their 'rear of the year - with the gloves off' rivalry in the afterlife.  R.I.P to such a great comedian/ writer
Rip sean we'll all miss you
My God.He was incredible...My daughter bumped in2 him walking down a motorway !! R.i.p. you Lovely ,Lovely man...
the man, the myth, the legend... Sean Lock
i can't believe this is how i found out. thanks. i guess?
RIP you fucking legend
RIP
He was a very positive yet cynical and intelligent and funny Man. He was great fun.
RIP from America.
One of my favorite comics... will be sorely missed...
Oh God no! I love Sean. He was the ultimate lovable curmudgeon. One of the funniest people at anything he did. Absolutely devastated. R.I.P sir, much love from America.
Will miss your comedy Sean 😢 RIP.
❤️from New Orleans, Louisiana.  Sean you will be truly missed ❤️
I only just found out through this video that he is gone... wow!!! I will miss him
R.I.P. Sean. Only discovered you through YouTube about three years ago. I’m American so don’t get to see many comedians from across the pond. Hilarious man none the less.
i just hadn't realised how funny this bloke was.... RIP sir...
That last is such an amazing bit. It's like he was channeling Billy Connolly, and having one of the funniest women I've ever watched sitting next to him is excellent for how delivery. Great man, on an excellent show.
R.I.P Sean 😥
"Coming home to a full mousetrap" - fucking brilliant.
Totally brilliant..rip😢👍
RIP Sean. Gonna miss ya
I don't know how anyone can give this a thumbs down. He was so kind and funny and just an amazing person all around. The world is a little dimmer without Sean Lock <3
Sending love to his family. Rest In Peace Sean, what an incredible legacy youve left behind
Was only watching him the other day !!Rest in paradise Sean 🙏🏼.. One of the funniest men ever to walk this planet !!
Rest in peace Sean, I will miss you :(
In between the laughs my heart hurts. RIP, Mr. Locke.
It so strange to know that he's no longer with us. Thanks for the laughs Sean, we'll miss you buddy.
Shine on you bloody bastard, shine on in the kingdom of God.
Great comedian, I will miss him.  Lots of laughs one of my favorites.
The comedian’s comedian, if ever there was one.
I have basically unplugged from TV and only just found this out. Absolutely gutted. What a funny, funny man. RIP Mr Lock, you’ll be missed here but will make whatever others plane of existence you find yourself, a better, funnier place. A class act until the end. Didn’t announce it to the world and make a circus of it. Spent his last days with his loved ones and went out with the style and grace he exhibited during life. Top notch, top quality. RIP, you’ll be missed. And deepest condolences to his family.
Travel well on gentle breezes, Sean
RIP ❤️
Discovered cats and sean about a year ago on youtube. Watched many of these clips time and time again. Seeing the rip come up at the end of this clip really hits home. Normally i belly laugh and move on to the next. Had to pause and reflect.
Hilarious man. Breaks my heart.
What a legend.
Cannot stand Jimmy Carr ... that fake-ass laugh is enough to make a cow sigh
I still refuse to believe he’s gone. He’s faked his own death as a part of his next joke.
What a tragic loss to the world of comedy, the world is a sadder place without him, one of my all time favourites.
A fantastic sense of humour and comedian RIP .
I watched so much Cats Does Countdown at the start of the pandemic and the laughs I got from it kept me sane. Sean Lock was such an institution on the show, it's hard to imagine it without him. RIP sir.
Beamrules was fucking class!
RIP sir, love from New Zealand 🇳🇿
Rest easy Sean. You were a true legend and a brilliant comic. Forever missed❤️
Wow I can't believe it :(
Thank you for all the laughs Sean.
Wow.. I had no idea he'd passed away.  Well miss you, Sean.
I really liked him, besides being funny, he was nice and gentle.
RIP
RIP
Vale Sean. Safe travels.
RIP Sean. Never an episode I didn't piss myself because of your jokes
15 stories high was an underrated genius of a show. Keep making them laugh wherever you are Sean ☺️
5:54 is that it?  for shame!
it's hard to accept. he always seemed so healthy and lively. surely he had at least another 20 years in him!
One of ... maybe even the funniest person i ever watched. And im from germany! Rest in peace.
It is fitting that Sean made people really laugh during his life. Now they are crying out of love for him. His solo stand-up shows are a joy to watch here on YouTube. I miss him.
RIP you legend
He was brilliantly funny. It's hard to believe that he's gone. Best wishes to his family.
Damn, just learned of this. Being in the US i didn't even hear about his illness. I discovered 8 out of 10 countdown during the pandemic, immediately fell in love with Sean and his deadpan humor. Won't be the same without him RIP
fuck man this one hurts; rest easy brother you brought joy to plenty of folks around the world :)
I learnt of his death through this video's title and I really didn't want to believe it. RIP <3
I genuinely think he's the funniest British comedian there has ever been. RIP you absolute genius.
legend
Still shocked about him dying he was so fn hilarious on 8 out of ten cats and 8 out of ten cats does countdown rip Sean u will be missed
RIP
I miss him so much!😞
You cant write tears Jimmy
Bloody big F, rest in peace you legend.
the money you have made from this video, could you give it to one of Sean's charities.
Amazing funny guy. So sad he's passed.
Legend.
"Well if you win I won't spit on you tonight when we're having sex." *Jimmy Carr, dying laughing wiping away tears.* "I've just got to forget what he said." None of us are going to forget what Sean Locke has said. R.I.P.
Legends never die
Lost two absolute legends this year Paul Ritter now Sean :( may they rest in heaven 🙏
Sean Lock  "The comedian's comic" You will forever be missed  R.I.P
A great man, rest in peace.
Lol imagine being dead
An absolute genius. Fantastic comedian, even better bloke. RIP
I think Sean is the first comedian who's career I've seen from start to finish!  Humbling
RIP 💗
I worked at JFK and he was one of my favorite encounters ever at the airport. Our meeting as he walked into the lounge: Me: "Oh, hi! How are you? I haven't seen you in ages! ... Oh.... Wait.... You're not who I thought you were - I thought I used to work with you! But! I do know who you are!!" So embarrassingly stupid. (Me with no filter, as usual!) But he was absolutely lovely (surprised a Yank knew him, I think!) and stayed with me chatting for 10 or 15 minutes. Lovely guy. Always enjoyed him on 8 Out of 10 Cats. Too young, so very sad.
RIP what an absolute legend
Love Sean, hate woke ch4 news.
Thanks for the laughs Sean, you'll be missed!
I'm quite upset I didnt realise how funny this man was before. What a hero. Rip
RIP he was one of the highlights of 8 out of ten cats
Sean's passing is a bit like losing Bill Hicks,IE. So original and laughter inducing,
"I slowed down for a horse" - Sean Lock rip
One of the all time greats in comedy- a unique style which was always totally effortless.Didn’t get half the fame or credit he deserved IMO. Can’t believe he’s gone. RIP, Sean. 🙏
A very clever man. RIP ...  what a waste
Sean Lock.  A King amongst legends.
Beautiful human being. You brought joy and laughter to so many. You you will be missed :,,(
I'm sat here on a random Sunday night, completely shit-faced from red wine, I have been rewinding this video absolutely howling every time, that last sketch is completely killing me, RIP Sean Lock, legend.
RIP Funny man. You are a legend
Nooooo~ mah all time fav comedian! RIP Sean Lock. Your comedy has a special place for my rainy days.
👍❤👍
He was the human embodiment of British humour
😂😂 class him
Fucking legend. Rest in Paradise brother.
Sean you are a legend and your legacy will never die buddy !! Rip Sean 🙏🙏
what a loss rip
Rip pal respect
Legend. RIP
omg hes dead? :(
Ah, Sean. In the unlikely event of there being a YouTube you can read in an afterlife, I want to say you're the dead celebrity I'm most upset about in years. Genuinely bothered about a man I never met being dead. How weird. Anyhow...  Thanks for being great when you were alive. Sorely missed. Sparkling.✊
Amazing talent. Rip Sean. Never forget you
Such a loss to the world of comedy. Rest in peace Sean, keep them laughing wherever you are now.
Every time the "comedy is dead" conversation came up with friends or family.. Sean Lock was always brought up within seconds as the best living UK comedian. What a brave soul, battling both his cancer and the PC brigade with ease for years.
RIP buddy. You were far too young to return to the universe.
I’m so saddened
RIP would have loved to have had a laugh with him ❤️
A legend. My condolences to your family and friends
God bless ya mate
He’s not funny
Dry. Abrasive. Rude. Arrogant. Outspoken. Unrelenting. Clever. Funny. Stupid.  He was great.  Carrot in a box, laughing at joe's poem, Claude, whelks and a challenging wank... Top of a long list.
Wait...when did he pass?
Im actually confused and interested why people disliked this video tribute.
Taken too soon. Thanks for all the laughs. You will be missed. Sincere condolences to all he leaves behind at this sad time of loss and mourning.
Sean was a master
How did he die?
My heart is broken! I'll really miss you Sean! You gave kept me laughing for many years. Thanks for entertaining me, 8ootc will not be the same without you
Why would you dislike this?
“Worlds” lmfao
Still in shock... Still a challenging wank if you know you know ... thank you sir for laughs. Rest easy now
Master of dry wit that reduced an audience to tears... Expect a lot of rain folks , for those angels will be pissing themselves with laughter... RIP..
Just pure comedy genius.
❤️💔❤️💔❤️
this is going to take me a long time to process
You'll never be forgotten mate!! Keep em laughing up there.
Probably the first time I laughed till I almost died. RIP you absolute legend
RIP
RIP
Lovely Sean! Thanks mate!
Oh nooo. I absolutely adored him :( RIP my man. A boy in India was a big fan of yours.
omg i had no idea he died. this was a funny guy. too bad
This guy was a genius, rip Sean.. X
I hope Sean knew how loved he was by so many people before he passed. What an absolute legend!
I'm not one to pray often, even tho I went to Catholic primary and secondary school, and I'm hardly religious. But as soon as I heard he died, I prayed for him numerous times. Hope he's resting easy now
I was gonna come in and make a shitty comment about how the title saying "Tribute" is kinda fucked, because usually you reserve that for someone who's passed.  ...And then I read the description. If it weren't for this video, I might not have learned that we lost a legend. Thank you for sharing this, Channel 4. God speed Sean, you beautiful bastard.
Guess the bag for life won, rest easy you funny bastard. Best comedian to have ever existed.
Rest in paradise good man 🥂cheers to all the times you made me laugh 🥂
Legend
Rest in peace, such a wonderful and hilarious man. Lost of love from Spain to his friends and family. Times may be hard but we want you to know that everyone loves this man and is here with you.
Love this guy. RIP Sean.
“I won't spit on you when we are having sex tonight.” 🤣😂🤣😂  One of his best lines.
He was very very good, his dryness and delivery itself was funny, you'd be laughing long before the punchline. RIP Sean if there is a heaven, they've got a great talent up there now.
Only 5 mins, this man has made me laugh for hours on end, going to really miss Sean, absolutely gutted, thank you for all the happiness and smiles you’ve brought to millions of lives!!!! X x x
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO, WHHYYYYYYYYYYYY, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, AHHHHHHHH.  You can't write tears Jimmy.   -Sean Lock  You'll be missed.
COMEDY LEGEND! RIP
Oh my god, I'm watching this whilst having a dump, and Sean starts talking about beating fern cotton to the British rectum of the year title.  The tears are streaming down my face. What a funny man, he will be missed.
The people responsible for the 500 dislikes should have died not him
Absolute legend. Thank you for the stomach aches, cramps, tears and laughs.
Thank god he'll live on through all the recordings.
Is shawn dead🤕
Crying with laughter, followed with crying with sorrow. You truly made the world a bit less shit. We'll miss you dearly.
The carrot in a box community will never be the same again 😣
Crying with laughter by the end.
Sean Lock eating whelks and the “what word would describe you” are my two favourites of Sean.
Wait what he's dead?!!!😱😱
One of the best to ever do it! R.I.P Sean.
RIP Sean
I can’t believe he is gone
He brought so many laughs to millions. Sorry he has left us. RIP Sean.
Lol so much and instantly had a tear at the end RIP Sean an absolute genius for comedy
He tells his story's with such conviction you can't be gone 😭
Rest in peace Sean
Absolute Legend RIP SEAN "THAT'S A CHALLENGING WANK" LOCK
he has left such a mark on the world, there aren’t many like Sean Lock, I hope he knew he was loved and appreciated xx
I'll miss Sean Lock so much. He was the only ever comedian to have my exact sense of random humor...
RIP
Fan bloody Tastic bloke
Hahaha, no more words are needed, though, bloody brilliant!
Always made me laugh hard. Rip sean
God bless you wonderful happy man
Much love fella
Loved him 🙌
how is this only five minutes long? Put some respek on his name ffs!
My favourite Sean bits were his previous employment, he said once that he used to spray the smell at the top of dog food cans before the cans were sealed, and my brain just went "holy fuck, that was a weird job!" Ignoring the fact that he'd just blatantly made it up on the spot!
RIP SEAN🙏🏻😢
Sean Lock, a stand up comedian whose brilliance I discovered recently and who died a day before my birthday. I am devastated to hear he is gone and that he still tried to humor everyone even when he was battling with his cancer. He will be dearly missed!
What a legend! You wont be forgotten. RIP
So funny my love …… Rest easy xxxx
what does Sean say here Jimmy: You're just rehydrating are you? Sean: i wouldn't normally with water, __________________, cheers
Funniest man in the UK comedy scene that I’ve ever seen. Easily. Will miss him greatly. Never failed to make me smile, never afraid to test the waters of controversy and that’s what made him so great.
A global hero. RIP
RIP Sean. Legend
Cheers, Sean.
What an absolute legend
i friggin roared at the seal clubbing. but the fucking flakes at ch4 edited it out.
Could the clip of Sean singing (about ‘Maud’?) be uploaded? Hope you agree it’s worth preserving.
Damn shame, how many British Comedy shows were boosted by Sean Locke
I never laughed at any of his jokes. just not for me.
May he rest in peace 🕊️
Who the feck disliked this? I'd stab a guess simpletons who pee themselves giggling whenever Michael McIntyre is on TV.
We're blessed to know he will be making us for many more years thanks to all the awesome programmes he's been on. RIP Sir, thanks for the laughs you legend!
The clips in this video you can hear him getting sicker from his cancer :(. This guy had pure talent, he didnt even need to try make you laugh. RIP mate.
It amazes me that he was such a legend he didn't need to even speak to illicit laughter from an audience of seasoned comedians. A true legend. rest in peace Sean. Merry Christmas you pair of tossers.
R I P you were incredible.
RIP Sean, a great comedian with a unique sense of humour. 🙏❤️
We've lost a true comic genius. rest easy, Sean, thanks for all the laughs
Rip you funny man x
Legend
I’m so sad that I almost pissed myself laughing  Seriously funny guy, we will miss you so so much. Most sincere condolences to his family and friends. Sean will always be a legend, up there with Cooper, Hicks and Dave Allen
Thank You Sean! 🤩😇🤩❤️
Vaccine ?
Being here in the States I hadn’t heard anything about his passing. It will be a shame not to see him on new shows when they pop up on YouTube.   Most sincere condolences to his family from yet another fan.
RIP Sean Lock <3
He was truly taken before his time
RIP Sean Lock, "Carrot in a Box" was the funniest thing I had ever seen in 40 years on this planet.
he was my mum's(Suzzane) best friend at uni and she always tells funny stories about him and how amazing he was, he will be missed x
FAR too short.  C'mon CH4.. Do the man and the nation proud as is deserved.
Beautifuly funny rip you'll be truly  missed by many!! ❤️

I would have loved the chance to have a few beers in a pub with this legend
To make us laugh even in the bad times is so rare, thank you Sean, may your God be with you, RIP

The official Obituary of Sean Lock, 1963-2021: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWHYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAA
how terribly sad! RIP Sean LOck Loved your sense of humour!
so sad, but so happy that i happen to love british televison and discovered 8 0ut 0f 10 a few years ago.  sean lock has made me laugh out loud  through some very dark times.  the legacy of brilliance and laughter that he sent out into the world will resonate for eons.  i can not even begin to know how to say thank you for that.  i hope his spirit is soaring high as he looks down and he is laughing the way he did when Joe Wilkinson wrote a poem about naming people's penises.   thank you sean lock, i will carry you with me forever
522 dislikes. People will really dislike anything
RIP
550 People need a Sense of Humour Transplant
whats shit is so many wonderful memories of sean lock are going to be drowned out by jimmy carrs grating and awful fake laugh :( im not even joking :( surely theres a way modern technology can remove jimmys laugh so it becomes about sean? no offence to jimmy intended, in normal circumstances i would keep my thoughts to myself, theres just way too much of seans humour thats going to be lost to the world because of someone elses signature and it just doesnt feel right :(
SEAN NO! D: RIP Sean Lock You will be missed...
Oh no. Am german and not following the UK news every day so I just heard it. Am heartbroken and dont know what to say. I loved his humor so much, he made me laugh so often...RIP.
I can not accept this. 😞
He used to hang round the betting shop on Montefiore Rd in Hove and drink coffee outside out hifi shop. Always talking on his phone in that Michael Caine on acid accent. It wasn''t until years later when I started watching TV again that I realised who he was!
Oh my dear lord what a shame, god bless you pal, legend xxx
will be greatly missed around the tv world rest in peace my friend and thanks for all the tv memories
To say I'm heartbroken isn't enough to describe how I feel
Don’t mean to be rude-who was he? I’ve never heard of him.
The welks and the 'I won't spit on you.....' - my favourites
Big loss
Seans routine 'Winning a competition to have sex with Madonna' is one of the all-time great comedy moments. RIP mate.
Big loss rip 🙏
Gone way to soon.
The world is a less funny place now that Sean has gone. What a guy
RIP, you funny man.
RIP Sean Lock. I watch videos of 8 out of 10 cats only coz of you.
Goodbye Sean, thank you for all the laughter....
RIP
Dude had a huge fan here in the states. Sad day
Funniest guy ever.  When he stripped down to that riddler outfit I was in stitches haha
R.I.P your one of my top favorite comedians and always
“I beat Fearn Cotton!”….does comedy get any better than this? 🕊

The Christmas card for his next door neighbours is my favourite joke imo, loved watching him rip Sean rest easy man
The joke "a dictionairy doesn't have enough words to describe me" went over way too cold. That's genius.

The greatest comedian of all time. RIP
I for one hope they replace such a legend with some diversity intern with the knowledge of a lego movie fan! or better yet, the antithesis of Sean, who wouldn't love that!
Absolute genius.
One of the funniest men that ever lived , to make someone belly laugh is a talent that can’t be learnt
he died? WTF i watched this  thinking it was normal clips of Sean until the end.
Legendary man
:( fuck sake man
RIP....FUNNY AS FU...
This is how I find out he died? I am in awe. Thank you for the laughs.
The essence of modern dry British humor. RIP legend.
Sean’s unique wit - dry, self effacing, accessibly intelligent -  was endearing, charming, and addictive. He was singularly responsible for hooking me on UK panel shows. My condolences to his family, friends, and fans.
❤️😂❤️
have  some fkn dignity C4. "RIP"? really? not "thanks for the laughs" or actually spelling "Rest In Peace"? probably not. I bet you lot were fighting over the spelling of "Peace" and settled on "RIP". jesus fk. i was expecting a better "tribute" considering your immense library of his appearances. Did you let an intern do this? was this a college assignment and this was the product of an 18 year old who fiddled this together in 5  minutes?  I'm seriously annoyed. 5 minutes of everything you could have just left going for hours and you end it, unceromoniously or without even care, you might as well have written it in Comic Sans, since you're San Comic.
Sean will be sadly missed by so many 😢 what an amazing man, love the dry humour! Thought are with his family, RIP
Its 'rear of the year' but with the gloves off... just amazing.
One of the funniest comedians on 8 out of 10 cats.
RIP Sean you will be missed
Thank you for being a bloody Legend. Enjoyed your jokes and may you rest in peace.
RIP🕊
Love him. Truly hilarious man! Not many people have such talent to be so very funny 🤍
R.I.P. to an absolute legend
<3
RIP x
A true comedy hero. It’s been a pleasure having him in our lives.
I saw a bit of Sean's stand up a few years ago , and my ribs were aching from laughing .   Caught him briefly on eight out ten , and thought he was uniquely hilarious , but apart from the tribute of his Margate gig on channel 4 a couple of nights ago I've not seen much of him . I have alot of catching up to do . So sad that he has gone too soon .
:(((
God he was funny xxx
Laughing so much at the brilliant wit of the man & his loss, way, way, way too early…….!!!
What an amazing man. Always found the perfect witty and funny comment, and everyone clearly loved him. Rest in Peace
RIP Sean Lock, one of the funniest if not the funniest man to have ever graced national television. He'll be truly missed
Rest easy Sean, he’ll always be a true legend of comedy in everyones eyes.
such a loss! he brightened my working mornings, grumpy old.. cute :)
Well this sucks. RIP. Thoughts for his family and friends.
The challenging wank quip was someway beyond genius, it contains so many jokes within it, such a layered riposte to Rachel Riley's quite brilliant attempt to avoid being objectified on the slopes, Sean's admission that he wanked, and the hint that Rachel may well have been a useful icon in his solo efforts, but that would not prevent him from picking up the gauntlet, to Sean, that was just a hurdle to be overcome......
He will be missed
Was so gutted when I heard he died, my favourite comedian ever, nobody like him, rest easy Sean, thanks for all the laughs 😪
You’ve gone and now you’ll forever be immortalized.  “Do not feel sad for me as I have died, be happy for me that I have lived”  - idk some tosser
Funny guy... sad loss x
You will be dearly missed by the comedy world. We lost a legend. Rest in Peace Sean Lock.
R.I.P Sean lock
Whoever dislikes this video has zero humour, Seans comedy is rare and far between, truely RIP
Best thing channel 4 has done since Eurotrash
Sean Lock was a Twat. What, too early?
The puny stretch serendipitously inform because probation coherently hunt inside a labored tyvek. shocking, hateful comma
Always a great story teller!! “Nazi Island” was hilariously brilliant just as an example!
RIP legend
He will be remembered by me and my family for as long as we live. We were huge fans... I have great memories watching him...
I'm going to miss this man so damn much. He was fucking excellent.
RIP
Love you Sean. Thank you for the years of fun.♥️😇
RIP Sean, one of the best comedians to ever live
So sad, Loved his sense of comedy
Loved his comedy style - rip Legend
Seriously unfunny man!
a major suckfest. Sean was awesomely funny.
RIP brilliant comedian
“What does it feel like to win a round of countdown sean?” “It’s like finding a fiver in a jacket you havent worn in a while”
Never before have I said I love this guy, well his rear brought us home an award. And I love this guy.
amazing person. A complete stranger says he will be missed.xo
AWWWW SEAN :( I hope you rest in peace, you were well-loved <3 <3333
rip bud
The BEAMRULES sketch was just utter genius. RIP Sean, one of the funniest men ever <3
Loved '15 Storeys High'  Rest in Power Sean
He was always my favourite on the show. I cant believe hes gone. RIP Sean
Comic genius. You will be missed. ❤️
HES DEAD?!?
522 people disliked this video. There sure is some strange people out there.
If the comedians could stay and the convicts be lost. The planet would be a better place
I can't believe this very sad news. A great loss.
Sad to see that your gone sean.. rest in peace my friend. thank you for all the laughes
Dam !!! he made me laugh till I cried ;-(
Man I enjoy comedy as much as the next person but my heart aches for this loss. He was really unique. RIP.
What a legend will be missed R.I.P 🙏🏼
Great comedian!
Thanks Sean.
🤣You will be missed 🥲
Thank you for this video. You will be missed. RIP Sean.
What a fanny magnet he was.
He's such a mile above the rest.....crying with laughter at this.  He will be sorely missed.  58 is no age.  RIP Sean
There are very few comedians who can appear on stage or screen and not say a word yet he/she will have me chuckling straight away. Victoria Wood, Les Dawson, Dave Allen and Sean Lock. I say 'chuckle' but with Sean it was more of a guffaw, my jaw would ache from laughing before he'd finished his first line. What a gift to possess and he had it and then some. Sincere condolences to his family and those who were part of his life. R.I.P. Sean.
May he rest in peace ❤
who and how can give this video a thumb down ???
He was one of my favourite comedians of all time. His delivery was always spot on and he perfectly encompassed "british humour" which in my opinion is the best type of humour! May he rest in peace.
Ahhhh shit, to have a beer with Sean lock would have been absolute gold.
One of the greatest of the all time greats
Rest In Peace fella. You've earned it.
RIP legend!!
I hope his family gets to see the incredible joy he brought into the world
8oo10cdc and Big Fat Quiz Of The Year will never ever ever be as good as they were with Sean on. Fucking amazing comedian. Always the good ones that go before their time. RIP sean. 😓
A lovely funny guy. You will be missed.
his energy will surely be missed
Thank you, Thank you for all of it,  when i came home every night since this pandemic started 2019 to now  i spent nearly every night purposefully planning my night to see him on 8 out of 10 cats, and he basically became like a second father, because i saw him basically every single day in some way so hes always just felt like family, i still dont even feel right after losing Trevor another comedian, but what the beautiful thing is, he'll survive in the work he left behind and it has and will continue for years to come to entertain all of us.i like the fact he was different,  i liked that Leslie Nielsen-esque deadpan delivery, the smirks when he couldnt contain himself. The world will be just be that bit less funny now that hes no longer here.  All the love in the world to his friends and family and coworkers etc.
RIP Sean you legend
Always annoyed me.
Rest up legend
RIP Sean Lock. Thank you for ALL of the laughs
I only started watching Sean a few months back and glad I did. Hes only on "..cats does countdown " here in Australia so that's where I know him from. Devastated to hear of his passing, I found out at the end of one episode,  it had in memoriam at the very end. So sad, a truly talented man
Nothing like him. He was so unique. A real tragic loss to the industry and humanity. Thanks for everything Sean!
Life would not be the same if not for Sean. RIP and thanks for the many, MANY laughs. <3
R.I.P One Of The Great Comedians Ever,Anywhere!!
RIP Sean - you total legend
Rest in Laughter you legend..
What a legend. RIP.
Rip man. You can never be replaced
❤️❤️❤️
Now Sean and George Carlin just made G-ds day.....prepare for the Matrix to get totally absurd.... RIP mate xxx
Thank you for the laughs Sean, you'll never be forgotten!
So living in Australia i have never heard of this man till YT algorithm said you should see this….so i did, only to realise this guy is hilarious and it was a tribute video, i am a little sad as I wanted to know more but ill leave it here and may he RIP, nothing out there like quality English humour.
Loved the man on QI; sad to hear he's gone. Let's remember the laughs we had with him, then.
Gone too soon :(
Absolute champion. Thanks for the memories.
Ah man! One of my heros what a legend
rip
Thanks for all the outrageous laughs. RIP
Rip❤️
Coming home to a full mouse trap. Brian & Margaret merry Christmas you pair of tossers. Rectum of the year, I beat Fern Cotton.  PMSL     RIP
Cannot get over this brilliant man passing. He was such an inspiration to me. One of the greats of modern day humour.
I hope Sean’s family are doing ok in these difficult days, that man was a gem.
Oh God Bless him, I didn't know he had passed away <3 Praying for his family, friends and fans who will so miss his wit and humour xx
Rest easy big man thanks for the giggles
You were a sensation and the idea of watching your comedy was the best idea
One of the funniest comedians from these side of the shores. Knew exactly how to keep the audience engaged with his off the cuff imagination, classic punchlines and had incredible timing with his jokes. We were all watching Sean's world.
RIP
You will be missed.
I never found him funny at all but RIP, got to respect the dead. My condolences to his family, friends and fans
RIP
RIP Shaun.
I live near the Leeds - Liverpool Canal and Lock No 58 is a dog walk from my house anyway I was planning to tie some balloons to the Lock Gate a few months ago and send Sean a happy birthday message on Twatter but unfortunately forgot die to being a useless cute ( 😉 ) of a man. Anyhow may God bless you and your family Sean you made me smile at times when I wasn’t feeling too great and you will be fondly missed. Don’t know if putting a pack of Dreamies and a wreath on the Lock is a suitable if badly timed goodbye because 8 out of 10 cats love Dreamies as I’m sure 8 out of 10 humans love(d) you. I might take a walk down there and have a can of canal water in memory of a great comedian.  🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
What?
The man, the myth, the legend. RIP you wanker
never seen any of his work till about three weeks ago. then bang i read he is gone. what a loss to society

You made me laugh thousands of times Sleep well Seán. Sleep well 😴😴😜😜
My favourite bit of his was the cubbing seals
RIP Sean Lock We miss you.
Jimmy; "Sean, what would you want to be remembered for?" Sean; "Well, there's the money I embezzled from the RNLI..." Happy trails cowboy.
What an absolute genius! I already miss him so much. He will not be forgotten. He's brought so much laughter in his time, and I'm sure he'll still make me laugh a decade from now!
When tears of laughter turn into tears of sadness 😂😥
RIP legend.
Gone too soon.🥲Remembered with a smile🦋
What a brilliantly hilarious man. It's a huge shame he's gone.
British comedy will never be the same again.
So many people on the bandwagon. Lock was highly overrated.
“AAAAAAAhhhhhhh…. Nooooooooo!!!!! WHHHHHYYYYYY”
He will be missed.
rest easy you sean, you’re an icon, king of comedy
RIP to this LEGEND!!!
God bless you, Sean! God bless you. Thank you for the laughs. You are missed. God bless you.
Such a shame he passed away. He really was a great comedian. Rip Sean Lock
What a sad loss.
That's the good thing about the internet. You never get something off it. And Sean Lock deserves to be immortal.
I was watching some old episodes of QI, later that same day I heard about his passing. Amazingly funny guy
Going to be hugely missed!!! One of the last great comedians
Sean was a brilliant and hilarious man he always had me laughing out loud what a shame to lose him and at such a young age 58 is no age to pass in this life time rest easy Sean lock 😞
He was incredibly unique and will always will be. Loved him, was and always will be one of my favorite people. Much love to their family
Crazy wonderful guy RIP
This was one hell of a way to find out my favourite comedian passed away. I never got to see him live. Rip.
A comedy masterpiece... that was Sean Lock. A true master of delivery and timing with his dry wit sense of humour. My all time favourite comedian. Whenever I need cheering up he has always been my go to comic and I'll be watching videos like this one for years to come. Thank you Sean for all the years of laughter, a huge hole that can never be filled again. Will be dearly missed. RIP you legend 🕊.
Rectum of the year haha what a great goal
❤️❤️❤️ this really brought a tear to my eye. He’s brought so much laughter to me in times where I wasn’t happy through cats does countdown.
RIP, great comedian
Why are people saying rip? What did I miss? I love this guy don’t tell me he’s gone
How can 505 sad sacks not like this? R.I.P Sean
When Sean was whispering to Miles about Hitler 😭  Rest in peace brother
Gonna miss ya Sean. You were the reason why I loved watching 8 out of 10 cats...
Can't believe that he's passed away. RIP Sean.
Thank you for the many laughs Sean. May you rest in peace.
Rest In Peace mate 🙏🏼 one of my favourite comedians for sure! Very sorry that we’ve lost him 💔
how mad do you have to be to dislike this video :(
Funniest man on the telly… x
Rip ❤️
F
May he rest in peace. A true legend.
Truly one of  the greatest . Rip
The worlds lost an incredible person, may he Rest In Peace ❤️
At least we won't have to hear any more of your horrible cruel animal jokes.
Will miss his dry wit...funny as heck was Sean. Tigers and pints...🍺🐯
We're going miss you Sean 💗
absolute comedy genius
RIP
RIP absolute legend. C*te
That's shocking news, he was hilarious. Not much older than I am and it just makes you realise how short life really is. Rip Legend.
Fifteen stories high, was one of the best comedies I’ve ever seen. When Sean’s character has to negotiate with the children who’s terrorising him at the swimming pool, it’s just wonderful.
The penitent cut peroperatively dust because semicircle finallly scare under a gigantic carriage. long, adamant ease
These are the people who thought me English. I watched him to improve my English and obviously best way to learn awesome side of British culture.
You can definitely tell his voice had changed in recent years. Perhaps it was due to the cancer treatment.
C RIP Sean Locke. I could watch Carrot in a box on repeat.
Disliked cause they skipped the seal clubbing…  I’m gonna miss this guy though.
Such sad news my thoughts are with his family. He was a brilliant comedian and cats just won't be the same without him. I hope they do a special episode in him honour.
Absolute legend
Rip A truly great man inteagent witty quick thinking and loved by so many what more could a man say for godbless.
An icon.
Everyone better like this, you fuckers! This man was and will remain a comedic legend of epic proportions 😢 R.I.P. Sean Lock
RIP
A wonderfully funny man - RIP Sean Lock, you will deeply missed 😢
Oh no! What a strange way to hear this news. RIP to a dead set legend.
Sean Lock is my favorite kind of sociopath.
dude has the best wit in the show. whenever he wasnt around, the show wasnt as fun. he will be missed terribly :( RIP sean
A very sad day ,when I heard,  R.I.P. you funny man.. our thoughts go out to your family.  A Legend!
The world just became a little less funny. RIP :(
Is there a carrot in your box?
legend says he now haunts jimmy's fridge
Absolute legend. RIP Shaun.
What a waste, such a lovely man... Loved his sarcasm 😔R.i.p Sean
So gonna miss Sean Lock, just going through a bereavement myself and then heard of his passing. Double shock, rip funny man. 😢
Fair play to him, he lived well and made everybody happy. Fucking hilarious comedian and it’s all loving kindness, no bullshit like.
One of my all time favorites. Devastated from across the pond. 💔
Cancer was the only funny thing he ever did and that joke cost him his life. Thank fuck as he was never funny
God. Damn. It.
Sad times, too young to die. Excellent funny man. RIP
R.I.P. Sean, I am truly gutted to hear of your passing but so incredibly grateful for the laughs you have given me over the years. The greatest comedian of our generation in my opinion. Thoughts with your family and friends x
I loved this guy. such a dry and witty sense of humour. you will be missed. RIP you legend.
Who's disliked this? If you're one of them can you please tell me why...I don't get it.
Brilliant brilliant mind and execution every single time! RIP great man
Was at a bar tonight and someone brought up mead. Instantly thought of Sean. There is a clip on here, somewhere, where he is constantly asking for more mead. Jimmy had  some on set. Came home to find out this. Synchronicity can be a bitch sometimes. Again, tearing up over someone I've never met across the pond and will never be able to watch Channel 4 vids the same way again.
My favourite comendian. Sean you make me laugh so much. May your soul be free and happy.
RIP Mr Lock- you’ll be missed.
He made 8 out of 10 cats just a genuinely funny funny man,  this show will never be the same again, rip sean
When did he pass? I'm only just now finding out. RIP SEAN
How are they ever going to play carrot in the box again now that Mr Lock is gone?
R.I.P.  thanks for all the laughs
The funniest Cat on Cats. RIP
Such a gift to the world and a big loss to see you leave.  Thank you for bringing so much laughter. RIP Sean 🙏🙏
The way he made it seem like he was making it up as he goes. Nobody will do than better than him. RIP Sean Locke
I've seen Sean a couple of times,he's my absolute favourite,such a dry sense of humour. You will be greatly missed.
❤️
Rest In Peace - my absolute favourite comedian on the show. So devastated to hear of his passing.
A beautiful person and a great loss for the UK. We shall be forever thankful for his support and vollenteering for years over the weekend. Sincerely the British Parking Association
Sean, carrot in a box champion, forever.
Rip
I am shocked. Didn't know what happen till i saw the comments.
a truely tragic loss to the overall joy of peoples. Love from America. RIP Sean Lock
The definition of Sean Lock? - LEGEND.
Sean always gave me the best laughs on 8/10 Cats does countdown, he will be missed but thanks to clips like these he’ll never stop making us laugh
RIP Geeza!! Such a diamond, legend,. Funny man xx
A brilliant man. He's the ultimate carrot in the box champion. My heart  is out there for his loved one's in this very sad moment in history. He will be remembered tho RIP Sean Lock.
This man was so good, if Jimmy asked Sean an innocuous question, I was already trying to hold back a giggle just in anticipation of what this man would say. Always able to make me smile. RIP Sean, you will be missed dearly.
Such a funny Git.
I can't believe he is gone, I've never had a celebrity death hit me like this. I still think he is gonna pop out from under a panel desk somewhere in his riddler outfit laughing hysterically that he got us. I hope there is an after life just so one day I can meet him still. Fuck I'm gonna cry, rip Sean lock you are the best man I have never met hahahaha
He will be greatly missed ❤️
R.I.P Sean Lock
Me: Hysterical laughter through-out the whole video until the black and white photo at the end literally caused my heart to sink 😭💔😢 Rest In Peace, Sean ♡
One of the greatest, rest in peace Sean x
RIP sean. thanks you for all the laughs
Fuck cancer :\ I just found out he died. Fuck... RIP :(
:(
Rip Sean, you brought me countless hours of laughs and enjoyment. You will be missed. ❤️❤️
RIP.  So damn funny you will be missed greatly Sean
he was part of the reason i enjoyed 8 out if ten cats, his absence on the show is irreplacable, rest in power Legend
insanely sad. way too early
S8 Ep 7  Sean Lock  Tradies Nude Suit  ( Sean Lock In A Nude Onesie )  ( Also The Fly Eating )

Absolute legend. Rest in peace. 💔
RIP Legend
Legend
RIP to one of the funniest most entertaining comedians ever.
Thank you Mr. Sean Lock, for making me laugh, when I felt like crying, for picking me up, when I felt like dying, for making me cry, from all the smiling.  Sincerely,  A big yet saddened fan of yours. PS. Introduced the family to 'carrot in a box'. Luv you mate. Catch you on the flipside.
I still have cassette tapes of him doing his routines during The Mary Whitehouse Experience in the 90s.  RIP Sean
R.I.P Sean  Heaven has just got themselves another loveable asshole
Absolutely gutted he's gone, R.I.P Mr x.
Truly one of a kind. So sad to know we will never hear his random quips again, you never knew where they were going but it didn't matter! Thoughts to his family
Absolute legend of a guy. He is the reason I got into 8 out of 10 cats doing countdown.
Sean Lock was not one of my favorite comedians. I must admit I  did laugh at many of his remarks and I will miss him on 8 out of 10 cats. I like Jon Richardson better because I find his personality a lot closer to my own than Sean Locks'.
WAIT, WHAT THE FUCK!!!!  I was sat here watching 8 out of 10 cats, laughing my ass off, and then see "RIP Sean Lock"! What a shit way to find out someone died!  I hope that amazing man is making people laugh in heaven!
Thanks for the laughs!
What do you mean RIP?  Oh no,.........
You can't write Tears Jimmy - Sean Lock
Rest in peace, Sean.  Thank you for all the laughs.
Well done to the editor at C4 who managed the task of choosing the bits. Rather splendid.
Thank you Sean, you are a bloody legend, thank you from a kiwi fan, RIP, heaven is a lot Funnier now, loved your style, The Tiger who went for a pint...YES PUBLISH IT IN  REAL BOOK FORM PLEASE, , God bless you, ya funny funny man,  love you, RIP.
The possible millimeter contrastingly trade because silk accidentally carve without a billowy pig. square, sharp nail
I don't usually feel much when a "celebrity" dies but seriously it has really upset me when I heard about him, I even teared up. The show has helped me deal with tough times so the loss of Sean Lock won't be something I forget any time soon. I hope his family are well, he was a wonderful man who's life should be celebrated. I'll miss him.
holy rip I am shocked i thought this was fake
OMG!  I didn't know he passed.  RIP Sean
Dammit Rest In Peace Sean
You make me laugh, love your humor R.I.P❤️
RIP
Sean was a working class surrealist.  a great mix of the absurd and the ordinary
Fuck me! Sean Lock died?! Sad...
Funny fun guy legend will be sorely missed.
One of the rare “Comedians Comedian”
God, this hurts. RIP, you absolute legend.
RIP Sean
You made me laugh, RIP Sean 🙏🙏❤️❤️
Thanks for letting Sean speak for himself
Jesus! This news really hit me. Absolute respect to Sean! The world is a worse off place without him. Time to binge some Sen Lock!
8 out of 10 cats wont be the same without you Sean
absolutely class... RIP
Awwwww :(
We love you Sean
The funniest always die young, Robin Williams, Sean Locke, Jimmy Carr... Hopefully
To the zoo, you silly bollocks.
Thanks for all the laughs, Mr Lock.  You made the world a funnier place.
So sad he has been cut off in his prime
F
It was a genuine shock to hear he'd died! If there was something on TV and he was in it I'd make a point to watch no matter what it was!
Vale Sean Lock  There's never quite anyone like him.
I had the privilege to attended to Sean at hospital before he was discharged home with his condition. I did not know who he was then, but he was really lovely guy. Condolences to him and his family (I don't wish "RIP" because personally in my religious belief that is a cursed phrase for the soul of the departed)
Always loved the GOOD LOOK MASCOT bit
R.I.P
made me laugh big time R.I.P.
Sad lose of a great soul 🙏
I miss him already... he's a man who will never be replaced, the mere thought of it hurts
Rip xx
The canned laughter machine is getting some serious hammer there.
RIP YOU LEGEND
Knock knock, Who’s there? Well it ain’t Sean now is it?
I'm just finding out he died and now I don't know what to make of this.. he was the king of dad comedy 😢
one of the few who could say rude words without them sounding offensive. A skill he rarely used, I must add.
I laughed so hard, then a sad tear fell out ❤️❤️❤️😢😢😢
Well this is sad 😢
He was very funny, his sarcasm was brilliant. And fans of His should not be sad. I would say that's the last thing he would want. We should laugh at his wit and humour.
Wow only found out this sad news .  I will miss this man, funniest on 8 out of 10 cats by a long way.   RIP go give heaven a laugh or 5.
RIP Sean. My favourite comedian, we will miss you.
Rest in peace Sean, thankyou for the laughs!
Always needed a laugh when I felt depressed. Thanks for keeping my spirits up; you will be missed.
<3
As a Yank who's only just now hearing about him after his passing, I really wish I'd known about him before. He was clearly a huge talent, and his timing and quickness were impeccable. A great loss.
The guy was comedy gold. His stints with Miles Jupp were some of the funniest I've ever seen.
Sean was my favorite.
What a legend
You will be missed Sean. Another of our best loved TV personanlities taken from us far too too early in life. Thank you for the wonderful gags you left behind.
RIP
I've watched this 3 times now and it still has me in tears every time. RIP
Rest in Peace Sean Lock. Cats Down won't be the same without you. Amazing comedian
❤
I will miss you.....
I'll have a beer with you when I get up or down there. Vale Sean !!!
Is Sean actually dead or are we all collectively taking the piss out of him?
RIP Sean. Forever funny.x
He'll be missed
Absolute comedy genius. Thank you for the laughs. RIP
A funny funny man will miss him
He was the funniest comedian on TV by far
One of the most funniest people ever , it’s hard to make me laugh tbh

RIP you comedic genius.
This the single most sad and single most funny video on youtube
The best we had 🙌❤️
This makes me really sad. I absolutely love this guy.
Rip but wheres the quote of what he wanted for his eulogy?
A really unique brand of humour that I've loved since I first saw his stand up. RIP legend
Rest in peace. Thanks for the laughs.
I have tears in my eyes watching him....a mixture of sadness and overwhelming happiness watching this amazing and funny man. Bye Sean, you will always be a comedy legend.
#1 trending OMG, RIP sean lock

This world we all must leave.  May he rest in peace.
Rest in peace sean
God I'm going to miss him! I've been trying to find the Sean's Sauce bit! Has me in tears (laughing) just thinking about it! Great guy! Great seal clubber!
Such sad news. RIP. Thanks for all the laughs.
I always wondered if I'd be heartbroken at a person I never met or knew passing, the loss of this man answered that question, not ashamed to say I was, truly one of the best
This made me laugh until I cried and then I realised, Fuck, he's gone.  Goodbye and thanks you funny, funny bastard.
If you wanna get a tape worm, eat some pork. If you wanna get a tape worm, eat some pork. Lamb, chicken, beef, fish, or egg. Forget it, you wont get a tapeworm.
R.I.P. What a total legend of this planet. In a better place now... much love!
So sad he’s gone. RIP Sean.
Some people are Geniuses in sports, science or maths. Sean was genuinely a genius too, just with comedy.
Without a doubt the funniest man on television for as long as he was on
I just found out, I'm so gutted. Rest in peace
:(
One of the greats
Rest in piece you absolute Legend!
God how lucky you are and how sad we are, you will not stop laughing. Love you Sean.
Never failed to make me laugh. Such a loss. Sleep tight Sean x

So glad I discovered Sean Lock last year and his witty and cheeky humor... Like the tape worm thing, the snail eating but mostly 'that's a challenging wank' comment and many many other things he said and did. So long 'ol fella thanks for all the joy you gave me ✝️ 🌹
What a cute, RIP.
Gonna' miss you, man. Gonna' miss you.
RIP Sean my condolences go to his family and friends

I know this has been said a lot, but he was one of the people who cracked up other comedians and made Jimmy laugh different than usual. He also rarely broke. What a legend. Such a funny man. Very quick. Very witty. He truly will be missed.
You know you’ve made it as a comic when you have other comedians rolling up with laughter. This guy was on another level and will be missed. I regret not being able to see him perform live. Such a shame.

This guy was so funny man! Legend
RIP SEAN the world will miss you!! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the novel coronavirus that broke out in China last year has spread faster and wider, affecting more than 50 countries in just two months. There have also been cases in which the incubation period extends beyond 14 days and the infected patients show no symptoms, making it harder to stem the virus' spread.  Another challenge is the lack of preventive vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Although a number of companies are working or planning to work on it, the outcome remains uncertain. Remdesivir, a new drug made by Gilead Sciences, for example, is expected to work only on mild or moderate cases. The lengthy drug approval process may also mean that even before a drug is put on the market, the quick spread and mutation of the virus may have made it beyond treatment.  Some hope that the epidemic would fade like SARS as the temperature rises, but there is no evidence yet. “We absolutely don’t know that,” says Trudie Lang at the University of Oxford. “I keep asking virologist colleagues this and nobody knows.”  Millions of people are placed under quarantine as the Chinese communist regime scrambles to contain the virus. With no end of quarantine in sight, many, especially those in Wuhan, feel trapped in their own homes, and their mental health is worrisome, which may lead to another humanitarian crisis.  As China's leaders grapple with the epidemic and its devastating impact on the economy and people's physical and psychological well-being, I am writing this open letter to share my understanding of the plague. I hope that they will learn from history and find a solution that addresses the fundamental, underlying causes of the epidemic.  Plagues in Ancient Times A lot can be learned from plagues in the ancient times, whether in China or in the West. During the Ming Dynasty, for example, a plague broke out in 1580 and infected more than half of the families in Datong (in today’s Shanxi Province), and it later spread to Beijing as well as southern China. When it broke out again in Shanxi Province in 1633, many people fled and some families had no survivors. Another surge of the plague in 1641, three years before the dynasty’s end, wiped out a significant portion of the population in China.  Besides plagues, the Ming Dynasty also faced other threats, such as the rebelling forces from Li Zicheng (also known as the Dashing King). The plagues, though, seemed to infect only the Ming Dynasty’s troops, not soldiers of Li Zicheng or the invading Manchus. Moreover, after infecting China for decades and weakening the Ming forces, the plague diminished in 1644 after the Manchu established the Qing Dynasty. To some extent, this plague seemed to be a catalyst for the transition of dynasties.  In the West, the plagues in the Roman Empire were also well known in history. After Nero began to persecute Christians, several major plagues took place: the Autumn Plague in 65 AD, the Antonine Plague (165-180), the Plague of Cyprian (250-270), and the Plague of Justinian (541-542).  During the Antonine Plague, for example, there were up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome. With a mortality rate of about 25%, the total deaths were estimated at five million. The disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and weakened the Roman army, ending a relatively peaceful period of Roman history.  The plagues stopped miraculously after people awakened in 680 and began to reflect on the cruelty against Christians as well as the general moral decay of society. In 680, Roman citizens carried the bones of Saint Sebastian (256-288, killed during the persecution by Diocletian) and processed through the streets. As people repented of their wrongdoings, the plague miraculously vanished in Rome.  People in other areas of the empire heard about this and followed their example, asking for the bones of Saint Sebastian to offer repentance. When a plague broke out in Venice in 1575, about 50,000 people died. Similarly, a plague occurred in Lisbon in 1599. In both cases, people marched with the bones of holy people in repentance, and the plagues ended.  Origin of the Coronavirus Outbreak So how did the coronavirus epidemic start in Wuhan? One theory pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan, but the first documented COVID-19 cases had never been to the seafood market. Attention was soon turned to China’s only Biosafety Level 4 microbiology lab in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, known as the National Biosafety Laboratory and equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, Ebola, and other pathogens.  The New York Post published an article on February 22, 2020, warning its readers, “Don’t buy China’s story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.” The article noted, “the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.” Chen is an expert who has studied SARS, Ebola, and anthrax. The report pointed out, “This would not be her [Chen's] first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.”  Whatever the theories are, the outcome of the epidemic is disastrous to China. So many people are dying, and the economy is suffering badly.  While people are venting their distrust in the government and calling for a change of the system, I believe there is a deeper reason for everything.  History Has the Answer Much like the plagues in ancient Rome that occurred after Nero began to persecute Christians, I believe that the fundamental reason for the coronavirus outbreak is the Chinese communist regime's persecution of Falun Gong practitioners.  Falun Gong, a meditation system based on the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance, has enabled millions of its practitioners to improve both health and character since its introduction to the public in 1992. Its main teachings, Zhuan Falun, has been translated into 40 languages, and people in more than 100 countries practice the spiritual discipline.  As more and more people were drawn to Falun Gong, Jiang Zemin launched a nationwide campaign against the practice in July 1999. The scale and severity of the persecution are unprecedented.  In the past 20 years, numerous practitioners have been arrested, detained, imprisoned, tortured, or even had their organs harvested. More than 4,300 are confirmed to have died as a result of the persecution. Due to the communist regime's information blockade, the actual death toll is likely to be much higher.  Jiang’s policy of “defaming their [Falun gong practitioners’] reputation, bankrupting them financially, and destroying them physically” is no less severe than what Nero did to Christians.  One plague after another struck Rome after the persecution of Christians began. If history is any indication, could the current coronavirus outbreak be a hint from heaven to warn against the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, which has entered its 21st year in 2020?
Great man. RIP you funny fecker.
brilliant humour sadly taken too young...
Aww man, he was funny. RIP! :(
damn
He made me laugh so often. Rip
I found 8 out of 10 in the beginning of COVID and binged as much as I could, Sean was an absolute favorite. Hoping for peace for those who loved him. ❤️✌🏻
I'm going to ask God to give us back Sean in exchange for James Corden
I’m giving my next door neighbours a card that says BEAMRULES for Christmas…RIP legend
Gutted.  Such a loss.
RIP. He will certainly be missed.
outrageous
what happend to him? when did he pass?
This was fucking hilarious until the end… bit morbid.
RIP Sean Lock!! You’re definitely being missed and rightfully so, you were and always will be amazing! You’re going to tear it up, up there! God bless!!
What a shame this was a real shock when I heard seen him at live at the Apollo amazing at his job will be truly missed ✨🌟
Didnt know he passed. Sad! RIP
R.I.P. to one of the funniest people I've had the pleasure of watching on my television screen. Still hasn't really settled in that he's gone, but after that does settle in I'll always have the plethora of clips of his best bits—for that, we are all blessed.  R.I.P, Sean Lock.
RIP Sean the world is a little less funnier without your sense of humour. Rest easy legend
Funny with out trying a great loss to us all RIP sean lock heaven is a much happier place now
I really have nothing against the guy but why do people make out anyone that died was some kind of super hero god? His humour was rambling, lazy and frankly sh*t. There was no attempt to say anything really funny or clever, just nonsense.
What the hell happened? I need some context
Not PC, not woke just funny!!!
RIP Mr intellect funny man !!
Rip you hilarious man what a joy to watch you with such amazing humour
I can't believe I've just heard about this. Absolutely gutted. RIP legend of British comedy
It’s so hard to think that mad ball of energy isn’t with us anymore. A lovely tribute. Thank you.
One of the funniest guys I've ever had the pleasure of watching on TV, an amazing guy! RIP <3
I am truly broken hearted to hear of his passing I genuinely believe that most people in the entertainment industry are garbage human beings and have little need of them but this man was exceptional. The world is less funny, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.
R.I.P Sean Lock Truly a man that was too strikingly beautiful for our small pathetic world -you will be missed old friend.
RIP Sean Lock, you've made me laugh so much over the years.
R.I.P funny man
300 to 1 like ratio.  Brilliant!! Gotta wonder about that 1 though. I mean this is one of the funniest men to ever grace the planet. I'm putting them all on a list. Selling that list to the company that rings you up every day of the week to say Amazon has just charged you fifty quid for something you didn't buy That'll show 'em
You were the best comic on telly of our generation..I loved you cos you didn't give a shit! in this crap destopian nightmare world we now live in you still made us smile..RIP Shaun..we're  all worse off without you..
I often watch episodes of cats does countdown, and although everyone is quite funny, Sean made the show.  His humor, quick wit, and nonchalant attitude resonated with me in ways that I cannot even describe.  We will miss you Sean, I will miss you, but you will never be forgotten.  Go with God and rest well. You have earned your peace.  Love and prayers to his family and friends. You are not alone, a whole world grieves with you.
It is a gift to be able to make people laugh so effortlessly. RIP Sean, your gift to the world will be sorely missed.
Wtf?! I'm shocked that he died.
He can only come 2nd to Rachel ❤️
Comic genius thank you for the   laughs rest in peace

Fucking legend
The undisputed Carrot in a Box champion
Carrot 🥕 in the box champion now and forever more. Rest well Sean
I'm a lucky Yank having discovered Sean many years ago through briefly living in the UK and watching various British streaming services. He was absolutely one-of-a-kind. The best comedians are the ones who can make the other funny people laugh uncontrollably -- Sean Lock was definitely in that category (along with Bob Mortimer). So incredibly sad.
Total tragedy.
A truly magnificent person, nothing brought him down. A huge inspiration to everyone, RIP Sean, you'll be missed.
RIP Sean Lock. I have watched you for years and your humour was one of a kind. You will be so missed.
Such a brilliant man!
he never resorted to cliche, it was like he had some kind of random joke generator in his brain, you never knew what he might come up with next.
Sean Locke was a sensation
Its how inventive he was with his comedy. Genius.
no way wtf
Legend.
Rip amazing talent for his jokes
RIP to a fantastic comic.
:( I miss Sean Lock.
I'm American (unfortunately) and a few years ago YT just randomly recommended some British panel show clips and I instantly fell in love with them and since then, with so many European comedians I never would have known otherwise - and that no one around me has ever heard of. Sean has always been one of my favorites because he seems so effortlessly funny and genuinely fun to be around. my favorite moments were with him & Miles, they just couldn't stop giggling together. it must have been such an honor to be able to make him laugh. never did I dream I'd be so affected by the death of someone who randomly showed up in my recommended clips a few years ago, but my heart aches from his loss. it's so hard to believe it's real, and I can't imagine what those close to him must be going through. I'm so glad to have all these clips of him to remember him by, but my heart breaks knowing countdown could never be the same without him. I hope he's at peace, and I hope he's still laughing and telling jokes. farewell, carrot box champion. you will be so dearly missed. 💜
The world has lost another bright star to the sky. He'll always be loved, always be, remembered, and cherished. Deepest regrets for his family, friends, and us fans. He was a joy to behold. 😇🙏👼🌹
Rip sean
RIP Sean. Thanky ou for entertaining me a lot, even if I just found you lately.

This guy was hilarious. Genuinely saddened hear he passed. Got so many laughs from him.  A true legend, rest in peace.
Damn. Sean Lock made me laugh even when I was sitting alone with headphones on. There arent many people who can do that and now the list just got shorter.
Let it RIP Sean.
He's fending off attackers whilst waiting for the AA in the afterlife now. Rip a good man
Funny guy, was my favourite UK comedian by far Will be missed, and did the honourable thing and didnt once mention his illness Good man.  Sleep well
Fucking hell, he was one seriously funny man. "when he bent over, he set the sprinklers off", Jesus, how do you come even come up with a line like that? Absolute bloody comedy genius. RIP.
i was knocked for six when i heard the news, absolute gutted that my favorite comedian has passed. The comedy world lost a legend
Rectum of the year is his best bit. Claudia begging him to stop just adds the cherry on top 🤣🤣
RIP Sean, you made me cry with laughter
Rectum of the year Hahahahaha
It’s so sad RIP 🪦 💔
No words can truly describe how talented this guy was! We are lucky to have had him grace our lives RIP
RIP Sean Lock. Me and my best friend were set to see his lockipedia tour a few years back. We went to London for the day and set off for Croydon later but the snow fell hard and the trains were cancelled. I feel devistated that we never made it to the show. Still a legend though. Rip once again!
Rest Easy Sean!
Carrot in a box.. Peak Lock 👌
i'm so shocked, he went far too soon. i absolutely adore 8 out of 10 cats/would i lie to you etc and have watched sean's bits so many times. he was so effortlessly funny and warm (even though his persona was grumpy) and i can only be appreciative we got to watch him on TV!
I’m actually so sad… I traded up a little when my step dad told me… RIP. You’ll be missed in the funny man’s circle. ❤️
What devastating news! Such a funny man! Had me tearing up from laughter many times. Can’t believe he is gone.  RIP. Sean Lock.  You made us laugh. There are few, if any, better legacies than that!  Greetings from Sweden.
To make someone smile is a great achievement and Sean made a lot of us smile and laugh!
Goodnight Sean, thanks for the laughs! Cancer seriously needs to fuck off.
Sean turned the mundane into gold, a brilliant, funny, smart man. I will truly miss him
So sad! I can't believe it. I just woke up and saw this. Rest in peace mate.
What a legend, cheers for laughs Sean
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Oh no what the hell i had no idea he passed away. Im a casual and watched 8  out of 10 cats only on youtube and he was my favourite. This really made me sad...
I will really miss you Sean
Damn, he was the reason I watched this show. Fuck sake.
RIP Sean 💚
Rest in peace, Sean. Such a talented comedian. Thank you for injecting much-needed laughter into the world.

Pure genius......God bless Sean. I still haven't stopped laughing.
What a legend! Such an IMMENSE TRAGEDY! And UTTER loss to Comedy and Entertainment, TV and all who watched him but also to his poor family! He brought so much laughter to so many, to lose his life so tragically young is just the travesty of how cruel life can be.. May he rest in peace and his family take some comfort in that hes no longer suffering and the sheer amount of laughter and entertainment he brought to the nation! What a legacy, his comedy will not be forgotten! God bless! 👍❤️🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Rest in peace . My kind of funny! Thanks for the laughs!

One of the best, RIP
Does anyone else remember the Christmas special with the “carrot in the box” game. Sean VS Jon. 😂😂😂 For me, I know something is hilarious if I’m watching it on my own and I laugh out loud. That bit NEVER fails to make me laugh me laugh my f*cking ass off. He will be sorely missed 😢
I'll miss his jokes and his radiance r.i.p you beautiful funny man
RIP Sean m8 ur a safe cute
Well done BBC. Rather than an obituary, you now use the dead to make you subscribe to your channel. Seems decency has left the British Isles.
Rip
RIP Sean. What a great comedian, super sharp wit.
You will be missed Sean.......RIP funny man.

This guy seriously helped me through some of the darker times of the pandemic. When  I was missing my family (haven't seen any of them since the pandemic began) Sean Lock would always be guaranteed to make me laugh my ass off. RIP legend
You'll be missed good sir.
🙂😌👼🙏
Legend! Rest In Peace.
What a comedic genius, fuck can't believe he is no more. RIP Lock monster.  😢
So funny and will be very sadly missed. RIP.
Such a shame will be dearly missed
Thanks for years of laughter Sean Lock you will be missed!
_”is it noise? Is it noise!? Would you say something you fucking robot”_ Sean to Jimmy
Where's _"nazi island"?_
This is the first time in a long time that a celebrity death has hit me hard! The guy just seemed that down to earth, like you could sit in a pub shooting the shit over a few drinks! I raise a class to yoy sean
Unique individual who will be sorely missed. Cry laughing every time you watch him. Perfect at his craft and was the main attraction of those shows for me. Legend. Gone far too soon. I will miss you so much, Sean.
Loved the guy. Hilarious. 💙
I feel sad. He was an outstanding man and comedian.
Will be missed
RIP, Sean. Your humor always seemed so natural and joyful. You are already so very missed.
Legend 😓💙
He must have been ill in the last clip as his voice is weak.  However, didn't stop him being hilarious
What a guy!
Anyone want to see Sean in his glory check out his TV show 15 storeys high 2 seasons 12 episodes of comedy brilliance
When a comedian has a room full of comedians literally wetting themselves with laughter, you know you're dealing with a genius. Rest easy Sean. Thanks for the laughs.
I mean you could create a whole series just on a ‘Best of Sean Lock’. Absolute genius and wondered how he was not even bigger than he was... Forever the Legend of British Comedy...
hyvä että kuoli
Genuine question here….  Why has the ordinary “8 Out of 10 Cats” show almost been….erased from the public consciousness?????  Why has it’s spin off taken absolute precedent????  Its good but, if you want Sean’s “best bits” then 90% of them are on the MOTHERSHIP not the KANOE   RIP hilarious fella!   Heaven is LITERALLY having a laugh now while we’re all miserable
So sad for his family. 58 is way too young!
Great guy RIP xxxx
Hope there is a heaven and that you are there now. Thanks Sean for making us laugh, for making us forget the world for many minutes while we laughed with you.
The challenging wank.
Fucking too fucking YOUNG!!!
A distinctly mediocre comedian.
Ive only just heard about Sean's tragic passing! I didn't know he was unwell and it's come as quite a shock to me! It really makes me realise just how short life actually is and how it can all come to an end at any time! R.I.P Sean Lock.....you gave me some really good laughs and you will be missed!
Best of British comedy. RIP legend
Omg! I just found out about Sean's passing away. I think a little part inside me died post this. 😢 I loved his work! The world has lost a peculiar talent
Rip Sean.. Deadpan is the best 👌
A great selection of some of Seans best bits.  One of my favourites of his... The Tiger that came for a pint
How did he die
Not many famous deaths really bother me but dam this man was hilarious and will be sorely missed.  His comedy will live on at least.
he was by far the most entertaining person of all in 8 out of 10 cats does countdown.
RIP you legend! Xx
Just an absolutely glorious comic. Saw him at the Lowery in Manchester testing material ahead of his last live tour. Just incredible.
He’s not dead he’s just waiting in the wings..
Man responsible for one if my life long earworms
Rip to the most funny man I've ever watched on tv, you'll be sorely missed, fly high 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
A talented gentleman

Rest in piece 💔 watched him since I was a little girl 💔 so sad to hear him go

Sad times RIP
X.
To Sean's family and friends I give my wishes for comfort and really good memories.
A huge loss for comedy. Over the years if I’ve needed my spirits lifted I watched old episodes of 8 out of 10 cats with Sean, Jon and Jimmy. So many funny moments. Comedy gold! Absolute genius of a guy that will be missed.
❤️🙏
Modern comedians are shite. RIP though dude....
He never that the neediness that a lot of panel comedians had. Just relaxed and always funny in ways you don’t expect.
I didn't know Sean Lock had passed away until three minutes ago, when I came across this video. This is terrible news. I don't know what to say. He was...a master among comedians.
The world truly is a darker place without the light that this man cast
Cannot believe he is actually dead.
Unbelievably sad! A hilarious man that made this programme!. You will be missed Shaun! 😢
i already miss him so much, cancer's a cunt
😭
Cried with laughter many a time watching this genius of a man perform. Can't believe he's gone. Rest in peace Sean Lock 🙏

RIP Sean.
Just learned about his demise. RIP great man
True legend xxrip
I always remember Sean Lock talking about the countdown to Charlotte Church's 16th birthday doing this big skip. So funny.
I didn't know I could laugh and cry at the same time.... RIP you lovely funny man. ❤
This hits hard. I had no idea he had cancer. Just one day… gone. A total comedy unicorn. RIP
Fantastic comedian, such a shame he's left us, RIP Locky
My humour too a tea. Spoton
Had no idea he died until this got recommended to my. RIP to one of the funniest people in UK, from Canada

Incredible comedian! Such a loss... my heart goes out to his family and friends. He will be missed.
Comedy Gold 🤣🤣🤣

As a Pakistani fan this kills my heart
He's one of the only comedians that  never fail to make me laugh, even before the joke or punchline, rest in peace Sean 🙏
More terrible news. RIP Sean Lock ♥️
Such a sad lost to comedy, naturally funny if not a bit controversial at times. RIP Sean Lock
Pure "Legend".... Will be sorely missed by all.... I imagine he is making them all laugh on the other side.... much respect Sean
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🥃🇬🇧
My favorite comedian. Such a genius. Couldn't believe the news this week. Totally gutted. Best wishes to all of Sean's family. You will be missed Sean. Rest in peace.
The comedy world lost a true legend!! Fly high Sean 💙🙏
"That time i went seal clubbing. It was like a trolley dash."  Immortal already.
Thanks for the fun times you bastard! 😢
Died the Back-to-back, two-time, Carrot -In-A-Box World Champion. Rip Man. Can't wait to see the obituary. "Nooooooo! Whhhyyyyyyy? AAAUUGGGGHHHH!" You can't write tears Jimmy.
Sean Lock, Thank you so much. You made us cry with laughter so many times, and there’s no better feeling. We are robbed of many more years of laughter, but grateful for the ones you gave. Respect. Peace out.
One of the sharpest comedians on the planet R.I.P. Sean
RIP 😭😭😭😭 lost an amazing comedian ❤️❤️❤️
Cheers
Very sad, lovely guy
RIP 🙏 spent he's life making us all laugh
About as funny as cancer, how ironic.
One of my favourite comedians rip big man
Legend
ever laughed and cried at the same time?
What a beautiful cute.
Farewell and thank you  Rest in peace x
Omg nooooo OK.. Im sad now... 🥺 This is so sad.
The loutish oboe disturbingly amuse because jury directly claim underneath a embarrassed scent. squealing, anxious landmine
RIP. One of my favourite comedians and a great loss.
Thank you for all of the laughs.  As with so many, I've often found myself crying with laughter from his acute wit and deadpan delivery.  One of the greatest comedians I've enjoyed on tv and YouTube.  Gone too soon, he is already missed.  RIP
Yes gone far too soon - the world has less laughs in it now! Thinking of his family and friends at this time.
HE DESERVES A BETTER TRIBUTE THAN THIS IS THIS A JOKE
True comic genius. Will be sadly missed.
what a bloody legend, i can't believe some tossers disliked this video
I attempted to contact and thank Sean for his tale of the nasty man in a car that tried to run him over ("did you wank me off" story)..... I had a very similar experience with such a nasty person, but Sean's peice helped me see it less personally,,, I really wish his people had let me thank him for that before he passed
RIP
Rectum of the year.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NO NO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rest in peace old man, we love you.
RIP you absolute legend ❤️
this is fucked.. I love u mate thank you for making me and my family laugh all the time. we love u. From Australia
To Brian and Margaret.  Merry Christmas you pair of Tossers. From Sean from next door.
God damn it!!!!!
Pure comic genius gonna miss him
Heartbreaking. A comic genius and a wonderful person. Always brightened up a day whenever he was on TV. A true legend of British comedy.
RIP to a true comedy great, f
So sad to hear the news, what a warm, lovely and very funny man
Nazi island
RIP. Loved that bloody man!
Best comedian love him sooo much will miss him on 8 out of tea cat 💙
RIP
I'll never forget his imaginary friend bit he did on QI. He was the embodiment of what I love about comedy. RIP Sean
RIP
World finals🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that has to be one of the best jokes ever everyone was dying on that old Jimmy wiping those tears away 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ahhh this sucks :( he was so damn funny
Gutted
love him, so sorry Sean, RIP. thank you so much for all the laughs
Have to say Tis a shame his died. I never liked his stand up but I dislike him in these count downs. I mean coming home to a full mouse trap……. You can’t right that 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sean was right, there was no words to describe him. He was such a funny man
:(
The only word in the dictionary Sean needed to describe himself was is 'legend'. Rest In Peace Sean Lock
It was a very sad day Wednesday, I cried for a great loss. Me and my dad always laughed at his jokes and always watched 8 out of 10 cats together just to see Sean. My dad passed 5 years ago and I always watched Sean to remember the laughs I had with my dad, it hit me differently when he passed on Wednesday. I will always treasure the memories Sean gave me and my dad.
A comedy legend, he will be missed by so many. Rest in peace sean and my condolence to his family.
Absolute Legend gone way to soon. RIP
Can the 439 👎 please explain yourselves?
Never a greater comedian and obscure story teller will there be. Good bye Sean you will be missed by many
He was so clever. I will miss him and I don't usually say that about a celeb I've never met.. The repeats on dave will actually be welcomed now... I'm glad he was with his family at the end, hope he realised just how much everyone would miss him, social media is filled with nothing but kindness (I know its only social media but it shows how much he was loved)
One of the best comics ever. Unbelievably talented and unique. But most of all he came across as a really good bloke. He's had me crying with laughter so many times. God bless you.
Amazes me that this video has dislikes ?
I really don't know what to say.. 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
He had me on the floor a number of times. Such a hilarious guy. One of those people that just had “funny” in their bones. RIP ❤️
I normally enjoy a good celebrity death, but not this one RIP
Such a funny man and so down to earth. Loved the can of water.....it's from a canal 🤣🤣🤣🤣  RIP Mr Lock x
Sean Lock was mean, and being mean is tight.   Thanks for the laughs.
Rip king
Genius, nuff said!
F
One of our finest and funniest. Commiserations to his wife and kids.
Fly High Sean you brightened up many of my days & nights throughout the years Rest in Peace 🙏💙
this video should be longer :(  rip Sean Lock, thankyou for the many hours entertainment
Absolutley unique.
Rip
:(
An acquired taste given the stream of rude and lewd output.  He was less than complimentary about a long serving British prime minister at her death.. Doubtless he is now at the gate of judgement.
It was the whelks...
Rest in peace Sean you brought so much laughter to all of us you will be remembered!
R.I.P Legend
RIP Sean! Thank you for so many tears of laughter ❤️
Are you sure you don’t want that bacon? You sure? Sure? Muh? Uh? Mmm?
Sean Lock. A truly talented man, clever, witty, a man who never failed to put a smile on people's faces. RIP Sean, you will be missed so much. 🙏
im sorry but what kind of person dislikes this video??
A brilliant man he shall be missed
RIP Sean, such a talented bloke ❤️
The worlds permanently a shade darker. RIP
Noooooooooooooooooooo
God rest his soul - such a warm and funny personality, such a unique comedy talent.  Tragic news.  xx
Feels surreal
Absolutely brilliant comedian, rest in peace Sean. We’ve truly lost one of the best
Rest In Peace Sean Lock.
No! I'm not at all one to cry at a celebrity death and I'm bawling I can't believe he's gone. Absolutely devastating
What a legend was Sean Lock. Thoughts go to all the family. He kept everyone laughing right to the end!! Gone way too soon! Xx
RIP Sean. You were brilliant.
Who the hell is disliking this video?
He's More Famous now than when he was alive
Brilliant man love to all his family 🤗🤗🤗
I'm sure he would love to know that everyone loved him so much.
I was watching 8 out of 10 cats does countdown the day before, pretty much all day as I’m in isolation, and then I heard of his passing. Madness even a few days on.
Legend! The driest funny man I've met 🤣 His sense of humour is so much like my dad's it's crazy uncanny! R.I.P Sean Lock
I found 8 out of 10 cat during the pandemic and fell in love with it. Sean had some of the best jokes in the whole show and he will be missed.
Love him, understated but hilarious!
Rip real one here 👊👊
Noooooo!!! Why!!!
Who’s actually down voting a tribute video?!
RIP Mr. Lock!
Best Sean Lock joke ever: “Did you know, a shark will only attack you if you’re wet” RIP absolute legend
And we are left with the shite that is James Corden 🙄
rest in peace sean!
Sean made people laugh. That's the greatest tribute of all.
Love Love Love Sean Lock! RIP mate
What a loss when we need him most rip
Heartbroken
Brilliant! Down to earth hilarious, says what he feels comic genius RIP Sir👍😥
Rip legend
I know you don't care what we think Sean, you're dead.  But we're going to miss you
Great tribute. Thanks Channel 4.   It was very sad news to hear of Sean's death. I can only hope that he's not in pain any more, that he's making people piss themselves with laughter wherever he might be, and that his family have some sense of peace, knowing what a wonderful, clever and funny man they were able to share some of their lives with.  RIP Sean Lock.
Legend
Will be sadly missed. RIP Sean.
Rest in Peace to a legend
Absolutely gutted.
Oh man 😢 didn’t see it coming, truly saddened  Rest In Peace mate.
❤️
Vale Sean Lock
RIP Comic Genius!
Sad he died obviously especially in the way he did. But he wasn't a comedy legend. Not even close
So sad to hear that you passed, what a legend you are the funniest man I’ve ever known of! Rest in peace Sean, and thanks for everything that you have done for comedy. Xx 😭
oh my god im shocked im crying
Really? RIP. One of my favourite comedians. Always made me laugh.
Gutted
❤️
RIP Sean, you were one of the best.
My favourite Sean Lock line is “for years I have been trying to shut out the voices in my head but now I am listening to them when they say ‘ Sean you must stop killing people” 😂
RIP to a very funny  man.
Noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can not believe he passed Rest in Piece you amazing person!!!! 😢😓☠️😰😭 He can never be replaced. We have lost A TRULY AMAZING LEGEND.

True talent!

This guy was addictive. Once you start watching him, you just want more....
Time to binge watch his episodes on the show, what a hero
R.I.P Sean 🙏🏼❤️

My one regret is never getting to see him perform live. Cheers, mate.
LEGEND!
Sadly, sadly missed, they broke the mould with Sean,  I'll never be able to watch female Vikings again
underrated comedian, wasted on shows like this.
Rest forever in our hearts
We are going to miss you, mate. RIP Sean
What a legend!  Let’s hope the tiger that came for a pint gets published :) I’ll be buying one of it does :)
Legend
Where is the challening wank  !?!?! RIP
Lovely tribute. RIP Sean.
‘If you wanna get a tapeworm eat some pork. If you wanna get a tapeworm eat some pork. Not chicken, beef, fish or EGG. Forget it, you won’t get a tapeworm! :)’  ‘Tapeworms can be found in beef’  ‘I’m gonna say Google, can go fuck itself’ Gonna miss you Sean 💜
The world has lost a gem, one of the wittiest people alive has past. RIP you brilliant bastard.
If ever asked my ideal guestlist for a hypothetical dinner party Sean was always top of the list. RIP you comedy legend.
Phone addict much James? 2:34
one of a kind
Always quality jokes
Truly one of the funniest people to ever live, such a tragic loss, thanks for all the laughs Sean
Thank you for all the times you have made myself and others laugh. A talented man gone too soon. RIP
He was never funny, then world lost a dud.
oh no.. i didn't even know about this. this is incredibly sad. one of the best comedians we've had in a long while.
There are some people in this world that bring so much joy to others that they will never be forgotten. R.I.P. mate :-(
The funniest man to ever live. Period.
I think Sean is the one who made 8 Out of 10 Cats... without him even with Jimmy, it won't be the same, like when a band loses the lead singer
I took my (now) wife skiing in Mayrhofen, Austria about 7 or so years back. We had no idea that there was an English comedy festival in town, and Sean Lock was appearing. We went out for a romantic dinner to a quiet little restaurant on the outskirts of town one night, and who was there, but Sean Lock and a load of his comedian mates. We sat on a table opposite them, and they just ripped the proverbial out of us all night. He joked that he'd spoiled my chance to propose, and I replied, it's OK, the ring only cost me £9.99 from Argos, I can take it back.  He ended up buying us a bottle of wine and we had a great fun evening. RIP Sean - you were one of the best. Our sympathies to your family and friends.
I wish cancer was a person so I could kick it in the face.
comedians are gods, without them we're all fucked.
Love him.
F
still doesn’t feel real :(
So sad to see. I never even knew he had cancer it was such a shock but seeing the clips near the end you can see he looks ill but i never noticed because I was always too busy laughing or crying at how funny this man was.
RIP
i never really got upset about celeb deaths, But this one hit me hard.  Such a great comic. xx
A clever and just simply hilarious man who I will sorely miss. R.I.P legend.
Wow, what a loss! X
RIP Sean, such a funny man. My favorite line from him "Thats a challenging Wank!" :D:D:D.
One of the funniest things to come out his mouth on this show...  Rachel wearing Viking hat and beard.....That's a challenging wank.  Couldn't breathe from laughing so hard!
His voice changed towards the end
i refer to the last two years as "lock down".
will be missed by so many but i bet he cracked a joke at the pearly gates
coming home to a full mouse trap, ohh!
There was a mouse in the moustrap today. I had a thought for Sean...
Only ever watched cats for sean lock. He made the show. Great loss..
Merry Christmas Brian and Margaret 😂
Posts a tribute to Sean Lock, needs to warn people about adult humour. I think that was the only thing we were expecting to get.
Keeping it pg and still funny as fuck. Rip you legend
Thank you for the memories. RIP
RIP lad
Possibly one of the funniest people ever to exist
absolute legend
RIP brother.
What a shame he's gone . Gone but never forgotten . R.I.P Sean Lock . Best comidian ever
One of the comedy greats of not only his generation, but also of this era too. Taken away far too early. Rest in Peace Sean Lock.  Well done to Channel Four for giving him a proper and dignified tribute.  Shame on those who disliked the video by the way.
Rest In Peace Sean! I hope there are a lot of challenging wanks in heaven.
One word......... LEGEND.
Great to see James Corden texting during all of these tribute videos to Sean Lock.  We're all in the Gutter, but James Corden is texting the stars.
Will miss you greatly Sean Lock 😔
<3 V_V
I can't begin to get in the pathetic, angry, small lived heads of the 425 people that would dislike this. RIP Sean. So sad.
This news hurt my heart. Im American but Sean Locks brilliant comedy brought me into british television. He was an amazing storyteller and did hilarious improv. God bless him.
What an absolute legend!
Noooooooooo Whyyyyyyyyyyy Noooooooooo Ahhhhhhhhhh
Who are the 425 haters. What wankers   Sad people. With no soul
RIP to an absolute legend
.... no this is rear of the year with the gloves off,.. I won rectum of the year
RIP Mr. Lock.
Did he already have throat cancer by the end part there?
A great loss, a true comic star
They should send the proceeds to all these videoes to his family for services
Why would anyone thumb this down?
Legend, a comedic genius! WIll be missed.
What a shock.. one of the most spontaneously funny comedians ever .. I’m sure many of my Australian compatriots will agree with my sentiments in wishing his family ,friends and colleagues our condolences.. RIP Sean you are one of the greats and one of a kind. Will be sadly missed on 8 out of 10… you were the 10🙏🙏
Gutted to hear the news of Sean's death, he made me laugh. A lot. Thank you Sean.
Top man, top comedian rip
what a shock. he was so simple with his comedy but hilarious. God bless your soul ❤️
Greatly missed. Much loved.
He's not that funny
RIP :,(
The Comedians Comedian. FACT.
Chur Sean, what an original ✌️
RIP you funny man. Thanks for many laughs.
What a wonderful human being. Sean will be missed loads, I’m not into comedy much but Sean never failed to make me laugh. Heaven has great gained a great man. Thoughts are with his friends and family at this incredibly tough time x
"That's a challenging w*nk". What a man. R.I.P.
Sean, thanks for all the laughter. You're missed.
See you on the other side you magnificent bastard!
Just goes to show people will click thumbs down no matter what 🙄
Ffs
RIP Sean
I loved him. Such a naturally funny man. That's a challenging wank will never not have me in stitches. RIP Sean you will be greatly missed.
Sean and Jon, the big stars of 8 out of 10 cats! You are missed Sean!
His passing has hit me harder than I would have expected. He has brought so much genuine laughter in my life. Very few people can bring me to tears laughing. I'll miss this man and his comedy. I'm sure he would have matured as a fine wine, the more grumpy and decrepit the funnier he would have become. F**k you cancer.
Missing him already. RIP you mad b*****d
Had no idea. R.I.P
Nobody on any panel show was able to spin a yarn or play out a wild scenario like Sean. The rolling tears of laughter is evidence of that. Happy Trails 💚🍻
Rest well, Sean. Thanks for all the laughs.
Who the hell down voted this video?!?!
RIP you beautiful human being
Fucking hilarious compilation,. Thanks for the laughs Sean. Say hi to Rick Mayall for me
Rip the funniest man in Britain❤️
I'm actually gutted that he has passed. Easily one of my favourite comedians and will always be remembered. RIP Sean, you absolute legend
Left wing sook this bloke. One less to worry about now! Boom!
Thank you Sean for making us laugh for all these years. My mother died in the same day with two cancers as well. She was only 2 years younger than you. I can't believe how unfortunate the coincide is. Stay safe Sean, wherever you go, good luck.
No way he died, omg 😱
RIP one of my all time favourite comedians. Thank you Sean for all the laughs you have given me x
Funniest man ever bar none ! His humour was unique especially in a time when we all need a sense of mischief fun and a love of the ridiculous! We will not see his like again . A huge loss to the comedy circles!
You Will Be Greatly Missed 🌹
A true legend
Absolutely loved this guy. Can't believe he is gone 😭😭😭
Not sure any other comedian had me in tears as much as Sean Lock did. What a man, what a legend. Rest in peace, Sean
418 THUMBS DOWN???? Why? RIP Seany!
Truly a great comedian always made me laugh so much he will be so missed what will we do without his fantastic humour the world will be so much smaller without him
What?! Nooooo!!!!! 😞
"Hot tarmac in a vet's flannel"  He's awesome. He was awesome. He always will be.
♥️
R.I.P my fellow Chelsea fan. Brought me a lot of laughs on 8 out of 10 cats and Big fat quiz of the year. That rant on the kids reenactment is legendary. Never forget.
🙏  RIP, one or the greatest to do it!
You were such a brudda ❤️
A natural comedic joy. RIP 😔
Wait he’s died??
Really strange thinking we won't be seeing him with all the rest of them ever again, it's just not sinking in for me at all 🥺
A-Z list compilation please! Legend, RIP.
RIP Sean Lock. You were the last truly funny mainstream comedian.
The funniest man on telly ever! Rip Sean, you'll never be forgotten 💖 💕
I'll try and get through this video without tearing up sad and laughing in equalmeasure!  I'll never forget his stand up joke about global warming; we're scrubbing jam jars and cans to recycle...while Americans are drilling for oil in the Arctic...mopping up oil spills with dead seals 🦭
142 Thousand likes, 400 dislikes. You where a positive influence in human history Shaun. 99.9% of those who knew of you and cared enough to vote said they liked you. I only hope the rest of us can live up to such an example. You are missed. RIP
Beautiful great bloke, super funny
Disappointing, it’s a real shame he was such a funny man, gone to soon 🕊
Thanks for the laugh pals!!! Onwards onto the universe!!
Thanks for the laughs Sean Rip
Sat here crying watching this. Joy and sadness in equal measure. Probably one of the funniest comedians this country has ever produced. What a guy. Rest in Peace 🕊
Even though his life ended short what an achievement he did with his life and made a ton of people happy and smile
Wait no way..... this man was a legend. What happened ?
Absolute gold. What a deeply hilarious man he was.
So sad
I guess I'll b watching reruns of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown for the rest in my life
Gave the world a good laugh a legacy we all won’t forget
Well done channel four.
The 1 and only Carrot in a Box master!!
R.I.P Sean Lock your such an amazing human being thank you for making me laugh❤️
i hope brian and margaret are coping well :(
Literally laughing through the tears here. 2021 has been (still is) one of the shitiest years of my life. I wish Sean was still here: the planet is a less mirthful place without him x
Legend
The wit this man had. Comedy rarely makes me laugh out loud, but Sean's unexpected cracks would have me crying with laughter. His passing has made me incredibly sad. All my well wishes to his family and friends.
A superb, RARE, RARE talent. Absurdist, deadpan humour at its very finest.  RIP mate, you were a truly, genuinely funny human being. I hope Spike, Peter and Harry have a beer with you, on your arrival :)
You will be missed legend
Rest in peace Sean. Your laughter, your humour and witty remarks will be surely missed. Gonna miss you reading parts of your gritty limericks too.
Oh shit, when did this happen... just found out because this came up in recommended. Rip Sean, comedy will not be the same without you. :(
Couldn’t believe it. Such a loss. Rest in paradise
Fanatic all round  great guy and sad loss to us all RIP
😢 when I found out I was so sad
R.I.P. Sean, such a legend.
Rip sir
What a funny funny man, love his humour and to show all of the best bits of Sean from 8 out of 10 cats,  it would be a very very long video.
RIP <3
Rest in Peace.
Laughter is love
What happened? It's a real shame. Gone too soon.
RIP
I only just found out - RIP Sean - much love & support to his friends, family & loved ones - much love from Aotearoa/New Zealand
:(
Legend… will forever make me laugh… God bless you John ❤️
RIP you LEGEND xxxx
Never a time when I watched Sean that I didn't fall about laughing 🤣 RIP Sean 🙏 💔 😢 Thank you for the many laughs, you will be missed 😢
So going to miss this guy! RIP Sean......
RIP Sean lock you comedy genius
The funniest guy on TV, just loved his humour and am gutted he won't be around anymore. RIP Sean you absolute legend
How can I laugh and cry at the same time! RIP.
I still can't believe the news. This is a comedian who will always be remembered for his particular style, the crotchety old uncle we always love to have around.  Also, who are the monsters who disliked this?
I cannot believe he's gone..absolute fucking legend..may he rest in peace
Sean Lock, one in a million! He will be missed so much.
Wonderful . Great comic and great man 👍
One of the true greats of British comedy. A lightning-fast wit, and an impressario of dry humour.
😔
Thank you for everything, Sean. X
❤️🙏
I love that man so much. True genius.
Jesus Christ! :(
Farewell to a wonderfully funny man whose hilariously quirky style of humour helped make shows like “Q.I.”  and 8.o.o.t.c.d.c all the whackier. A greatly sad loss to  British Showbiz. Vale, Great Man! 👼 😢
Rip u genius
Absolute genius of a man RIP.
What a guy
What a loss, gone before his time, though he would probably say sod off I wanted to go anyway. RIP
I can imagine Sean and Rik Mayal ripping the crap out of each other “upstairs”. RIP you beautiful soul x
Hit me hard this . Never ever failed to make me laugh . On the toughest of days . May you rest in peace and keep the heavens in tears of laughter.
Lost a legend. Rest In Peace
Genuinely makes me sad that this absolute legend is gone. He has had me crying and struggling to breathe over the years, RIP mate.
RIP Mr Lock
Sean lock did a comedy TV series called 15 Storeys high (he's the main character), fully available on YouTube for free
“You can’t write tears, Jimmy” RIP 💔
What the frig.  I didn't know he died, so I was crushed at the end of this.  Brilliantly funny guy, how about we take the F out of cancer?
His nazi island idea was up there too. One of the greatest panel show comedians. RIP
A real amazing soul. Can't believe this.
Absolute legend.. RIP Sean, you will be remembered fondly.
Just found out…devastated, but thankful for all the laughs
I just have to add my little tribute to the great man. So it IS true - the good do die young.
Sleep tight Sean xx You are loved xx
If Sean had been a politician, we would have been hearing from some dour commentator about the influence he had brought to achieve the odd bit of good in his electorate. If he'd been a sportsman, we would have seen a few highlights of his best moments on the track/field. Would that have made us feel better? I suspect not. Instead, we've had the pleasure of watching, and laughing, and crying, as these clips have evidenced his supreme skill as a comedian. And we felt better afterwards. I'm sure his comedic skills have improved the lives of many more people than most politicians, because laughter is truly a tonic which should be taken at least once a day.
Such a talented man 🙏🏻💜
Rip to a legend ❤️
Shame very good comedian my condolences to his family
Carrot in a Box champion!!!
RIP you wonderful Man
Top bloke.  Rest in peace - you brought the right kind on insane humour to a totally insane world.  My heartfelt condolences to his family.  🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
My body is trying to be sad but everytime I see Sean I start pissing myself laughing.
RIP mate, you were always my favourite.
This video will be a challenging wank. RIP Sean, you hilarious bastard. I'm gonna miss you badly. 😔🙏

What a man !!
Rocked me when I heard this news. Been watching Sean for years.  Hope there's a place to listen to his gritty limericks in the afterlife 😫
One word to describe this man…. Legend!

i was shocked when i heard he had passed away...i suffer badly from anxiety and depression..Sean always cheered me up
The fact seeing this video pop up in my recommended was how I found out he passed is the worst. RIP Sean Lock, i'm not from Britain or anything, but he is one of the first comedians to introduce me to these wonderful shows.
What an absolute LEGEND!
He will be sorely missed.
mad lad. perfect.
Rip
Can’t believe this legend has left us .. thank you for making the world a slightly better place with your time you had with us … rip Sean love from the Uk 🇬🇧

No doubting he is funny as fuck!
Only 6 minutes :( we lost a beautiful comedic genius
I usually don’t feel much when a celebrity passes on but I was genuinely sad when I just learned about Sean. He always made me laugh and seemed like a genuinely nice and very funny man. RIP Sean.
Legend
Noooooooooo whhhhhyyyyyyyyyyy nnoooooooooo  aaaahhhhhhhh
Rest in peace, Sean.  Tones(yes, I spelled it the British way, out of respect for Sean) of praise and laughter from this American.  You MADE those Channel 4 shows, as far as I'm concerned.  You will be greatly missed.
And the world becomes a little more bleak.
He was my absolute favourite.. Gutted..
I will miss you Sean Locke
WHAT?! SEAN IS GONE??  I had no idea… I’ll miss him. Gone far too soon.
This guy was a legend. Rest in peace
still feeling miserable, but grateful for all the video moments we can rewatch at any time ❤️ his legacy will live on
Oh Sean. You will be missed. Always funny and having a laugh. Thank you for YouTube we will have you here
Not even the existence of James Cordon could tarnish this tribute. RIP Sean Lock.
Obviously not on this video, but my favorite Sean Lock panel show moment was when he was reacting to Stephen Fry and Rory McGrath arguing about birds on QI. The portal to the underworld is the funniest physical comedy Ive ever seen.
😢
Sadly missed, wickedly funny man.
What a guy! Crying with laughter at the end
Devastated at him passing away....my teenage son had grown up loving watching 8 out of 10 and Sean, talked about going to see him on his next tour... gutted 😞
Rest in pe
<3
Rest In Peace…thanks for all the laughs ❤️ I will never forget the carrot in a box
oh this i didn,'t know, i'm so sorry, rip
Genuinely saddened by the news of Sean passing. Rip
To all those who have disliked this video. Shame on you!
Very funny man, gone way to early... Put man on moon but can't cure cancer.... Shocking
RIP YOU ALL TIME GREAT, GONE WAY TOO SOON
R.i.p a great loss.
You will be missed! Rest in peace Sean.
I saw this video as a suggestion. I had no idea about his death. And the first word that I uttered out loud were, 'Oh no. Please no.'  Miss him. I fucking howled at his comedy. Out loud. And now I will deep inside for his death.
rest easy Sean. An absolute legend.
Shaun you flawless dry wit will be remembered forever!!..  RIP 🙏
Almost three million views in barely two days! That is how popular Sean was. He made us laugh for many years, and now some of us need to cry a little bit. 😢
Such a massive loss for the world. RIP to one of the best of all time, and winner of the next Heavenly Rectum of the Year
Such a chaotic personality. This compilation didn't even show the half of it. Let's hope he's shooting show jumpers in heavan
Shame to have lost you, Sean. You and Joe made that show worth watching.
so so sorry he has gone. rip SEAN
What hero, he’s brought me and I’m sure lots of others so many smiles. RIP
"That's a challenging wank" has got to be one of the funniest lines ever said on television. RIP Sean. You were brilliant.
The only reason i watched 8 out of 10...fucking nutter who knew what comedy was unlike Jimmy bs and the rest of them beggars, true geezer, bless one man. Fortunate to of spoken to Sean several times, lovely pro. Number 1 bruv.
National treasure. The amount of hours of laughter people have had in their lives because of this guy is priceless. He really was a naturally gifted comedian. Will be dearly missed.
He never failed to make me laugh. He will be missed. RIP
One of the only comedians to always make my sides ache with laughter RIP❤️
Carrot in a box. Funniest thing I have fucking seen. Laughed my arse off. Very sad.
RIP mate. Thanks for all the laughs.
❤ Will be missed!!
He just was , Wasn't he...
My favourite person on the show.. If you want to get a tapeworm eat some pork.
We loved your comedy down in NZ. A true and beautiful legend.
I cant believe he's gone :(
I am actually heart broken! Just a terrible loss to the world! RIP
Always liked Sean's dry humour and quips and read in Wikipedia that Andre Tarkovsky's 1979 sci-fi film Stalker greatly affected him. Never saw the film but was certainly affected when I played 3 of the Stalker PC games released where you play a stalker, a kind of nomadic wanderer in a radioactive wilderness. In Chernobyl, Fall of Pripyat, the digital artists have lovingly created a scale model of Pripyat with the iconic Ferris wheel and funfair in which you can wonder around if you choose to, the towns inhabitants had once serviced the nearby Chernobyl nuke plant. You can see why it would have affected Sean because it got me too. A few years ago watching a documentary on Pripyat the Ghost town, and I was right back into the game.  15 Storeys High, his series about the tenants of a high-rise is a classic, one of my favourite episodes was about Blue, a Polish energy drink that turned your tongue that colour.  Ed Power of the Daily Telegraph once wrote 'Sean was a Samuel Beckett trapped in a Tommy Cooper punchline.'
Absolute comedy legend. RIP Sean, we'll miss ya.
Too damn young man, too damn young :(
God bless and R.I.P Sean Lock💯💔🙏😰
RIP Sean ❤
The world just got a lot less funny 😢
As much as it's Joe's bit, his famous poem is made all the better by Sean's reaction, which is not dissimilar from Claudia's reaction in this video.   RIP Sean.
Such a fiendishly brilliantly funny man. RIP Sean.
You were a lovely man. May angels fly you to your rest.
One of my favourite people... Rest in Peace.
He was genuinely too young to go
I’m glad to see this as first on trending. I’m gonna miss seeing him on countdown
😥
It is unbelievable. Can’t understand it. You will be highly missed
Wonder if he got the jab.
Awww you can see the light in his eye when Claudia said she couldn't breathe  What a insurmountable loss
Rest in power brother
I will never look at Welks the same way
he was amazing on that show top bloke
Absolute comedy genius
A funny fucker RIP FELA
One of the most funny people, and in such an effortless way. Incredible
what horrible news to wake up to when I found out he was dead  I loved watching 8 of 10 cats/does countdown purely because of the energy this man produced
RIP Sean Lock, may the carrot eternally be in your box
The Angels are enjoying a laugh tonight. X
Sorry, I'm intrigued / astounded as to why anyone would give this the thumbs down, minor percentage or otherwise. An astonishing man and outright genius who gave people joy and would have them ask the next day 'Did you see 8 out of 10 Cats last night? And when Sean said...' Thank you for all the laughs mate, and for making my head feel a bit more of a normal place to live.
Beautiful beast.
I "RARELY EVER" GET UPSET BY A CELEBRITY DEATH BUT SEANS DEATH HAS STRUCK ME DEEPLY !!! I LIVE IN JAPAN AND I THINK I WOULD WATCH SEAN AT LEAST ONCE PER WEEK AND HIS HUMOUR BOUGHT JOY TO MY LIFE !!! ALTHOUGH I NEVER NEW HIM PERSONALLY HE TOUCHED MY LIFE ! Im SO SAD FOR HIS FAMILY !  RIP !
funny man with a kind heart
I'm Canadian and recently came across 8 out of 10 cats and had been binge watching. He makes me laugh every time I watch him  He can make me laugh out loud particularly when he made himself laugh  What a gift to make others laugh and he was good at it
God you can really tell something was up in that last clip. RIP to an absolutely hilarious and genuinely lovely guy.
RIP🕊 You will be missed.
So sad. Truly heart breaking.
Rip Sean thanks for the laughs. One of my fav comedians. ❤️ now your there with the rest. Tell robin williams he’s missed too!
He will be missed greatly.
Legend
RIP
I've watched so much 8 out of 10 cats does countdown that Sean feels like a family member. So sad.
Sean will always be my favourite comedian on a panel show, especially Cats does Countdown. Of course I'm also a fan of him outside of these shows. I still can't get over that he's no longer with us. The world lost a great comedian, and Heaven gained a LEGEND. RIP Sean, you'll NEVER be forgotten.
RIP you crazy loveable SOB ❤️
Very funny man. R.I.P.
He was a legend. Just plain and simple.
One of the all time greats, I appreciate the time I've had to listen to him.
R.i.p Sean . I had no idea he did pass away.
R.I.P > A true chuckler! Will be missed!
R.I.P
Found out today, can't believe I cried for someone I didn't know personally. Rest in peace buddy.
Wait....he passed away?
I remember stumbling across his bit on Carlsberg special brew some years ago when I was suicidal. Very special man, sadly missed. He always seemed like a friend. Love to his loved ones and mates. Sean was a one off.
RIP my condolences to sean's family been a fan for a long time . A man that always made me smile ty sean rest in peace.
Fantastic Talent. God bless his family and friends, may his funniest moments shared with his fans be enough to pull you through the dark days 💙  A stand up legend who will never be forgotten x
Bhh
Why for the 'biggest achievement in life' didn't you include the seal clubbing bit. I know it's not exactly 'pc' but it's one of his funniest moments. As is the one where he rips the piss out of kids acting in a school play.
Who remembers his book on how to start smoking?😂😂
Sean Lock.  Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  Thank you SO much xx
Brilliant man, he was always hilarious and will certainly be missed by all.
Will be dearly missed, asI told my friend, I'll eat pork in his honor.
RIP Sean, you always make me smile!
The Beamrules/Christmas card thing kills me every time. Such a great comic mind.
I can´t believe he is gone :(
Absolutely wonderful man and comedian, clearly he wasn't well in the final clip. Condolences to his family.
HE DIED?????
World just got a little less funny, RIP what a gem of a human being
Never to be defeated Carrot in a Box Champion
I discovered him over the pandemic.  I’ve been binge watching him in this show. He’s made me laugh so hard. Is it weird to feel sad?  Cause man I do about him gone.
Legend.
Interesting fact: a shark will only attack you if you're wet.
RIP M8
Sean was always the best thing about 8 out of 10 Cats and Countdown for me. A legend. Such a shame.
That a great loss, Rip my man 💔
Coming home to a full mouse trap
I can't believe he's gone, so sad. He'll be missed by so many
That man is, and will always be a comedy gem, I tear up with both laughter and sadness watching his clips, RIP Mr Lock x
So sad. There'll never be another. Thanks for all the laughs Sean.
Spent the evening binge watching 15 Storeys High.  Superb.
why do so many people think he was funny ?
Rest in Peace Legend.
RIP
Well Jesus,he's you're problem now.
I still can't believe he's gone - part of me just wanted him to live forever. Always bright and quick to make everyone laugh. Heaven's got a lot funnier now. R.I.P Sean Lock ❤
GLAD
Still can’t believe that I’ll never see this man on tv again. Such a brilliant example of British comedy
One of the best. Will be greatly missed.
Can't believe it. So sad. RIP Sean Lock
Off to the Whale Clubbing Society in the next phase.
z list at best
Just found out a huge loss for comedy
RIP Sean - Think of him and smile
RIP Sean ❤
dry as fuck RIP
Devastated by the news ..RIP Sean.. you made me laugh for years…
absolutely beautiful fly high ❤️
Best comedian in my life time.
Boring
I am left heavy in the heart hearing this news and if I may, I feel I must say: Thank you for being  You.  For that alone made a difference in making a difference in clearing away the gray, when the whelm from emotions brought more than sought and seemed to have no end.  There you stood the non hero - Hero with cheeky insights and the wry look on your face.  You made it clear "Have No Fear" and then stand clear by not getting in my way.   Indeed a Thank you!  He's Black and Blue working it Deadpan, The Funny Man Mr. Sean Lock.     He has never not once failed me when I needed a funny fix.  Ahh the good times!  So in closing fashion like The Dolphins in The Hitchhikers Guide would say "So Long and Thanks For All The Fish!"   RIP  Sean Lock..
This video made me cry with laughter and at the end cocked up with sadness. R.I.P. Mr Lock.
Big love.
I watch Cats does Countdown reruns almost daily. Sean was fantastic every single time. Rest easy, you genius x
Thank you. The world is a sadder place with one less great underrated comedian. My condolences to Sean's family.
Such a nice man. Clever, well observed comedy.  Guy was sharp.  Rest easy. Sorry you’re gone. The world is a little bleaker without you.
I never watched an episode without Sean in it.. Never will..
م   ا
WHAT HES DEAD!!!!!! Noooooo🥺 aww rest In peace… wow I’m shocked
Such a great loss
So sad, a comic legend, loved him RIP.
Will miss hearing your comedy that made me laugh no matter how much I listened to it ❤💔
Absolute legend 👏🏻  Rest in Peace Sean 🙏🏻
What a terrible loss Sean is, loved him on this show, way too young
Oh Sean!
There wasn't a comedian alive that could make Jimmy laugh more than Sean Lock. RIP Sean. There will never be one like you ever again
If you dislike the video you are either a peado/ Karen or other (all the same) comment why you disliked
❤
Only 6 minutes for a tribute, shame on you Channel 4
Funny funny fecker. Had an almost Irish sense of surreal humour (if my English friends will allow me to observe) .So sad, but what a legacy of laughs to leave behind. x
Very sad, RIP
You made me laugh for many years you funny bastard. R.I.P Sean, millions across the world will miss you, NO ONE WILL EVER FILL YOUR BOOTS. Next time we hear the thunder in the clouds above we’ll know it’s just you again, entertaining the gods above and no doubt the ones below as they stomp their feet in laughter.
Well that's a challenging wank.
Brilliant comedian will be missed ❤️
❤️
I started watching 8 out of 10 cats does Countdown clips a few months back. Binged through compilations the whole night, laughed so hard I cried sometimes.  Being from Singapore, we don't get stuff like this on our TV, obviously, so I had no idea this existed. I only found this because I searched up Jimmy Carr, having seen him on Celebrity Juice years back (another YouTube find).  I instantly fell in love with Sean Lock's character. My favourite moment of his was when Rachel Riley was donning the Viking helmet and a beard and he retorted "that's a challenging wank". I eagerly waited for new compilations.  Just two days ago, I got the news that he passed on. It really hit me like a truck even though I never knew him, because he was just such a valuable asset to British comedy and to the show.  His jokes got me through some tough times via the show, and I am eternally grateful for that. Its unfortunate the rest of us won't get to witness this man in action any more, but I'm sure he's cracking up the masses in Heaven.  Rest in peace, Sean. You will be sorely missed.
RIP Sean. ):
Look at those likes!! What a wonderful human, we were lucky to have Sean <3
It's sad knowing he died of lung cancer. You can hear in the last clip his voice wasn't right, been that way a couple years. Poor guy suffering and still bringing us entertainment. R.I.P
I have a word for people how love Sean, people with a sense of humor and love. Hit me harder than enyone we lost this year, RIP to one of the kings of brittish comedy.
made me laugh you amazing man
The guy just effortlesly made people laugh whenever someone was in and around him they were smiling and laughing, takes a special person and character to have such a talent, why is it always the good people taken too soon when the world is full of horrible bastards! RIP
372 people who’ve never laughed
This really is very sad 😢
Wow so sad he's gone, a true loss to all. Huge condolences to the family and friends.  RIP funny man
If only it had been Jimmy Carr....
May he rest in peace, and haunt Rachel Riley's dressing room forever.
You deserve to be missed
Carrot in a Box lead me to so many shows.  Thank you for that Sean.  Some of the best TV I've ever seen.
Thanks for this, a worthy collection indeed.  How did you whittle it down to 6 mins though, I would be struggling to get down to 2 hours.  How can we be sad with such incredible jokes like these.
Miss you !!!!!!!!!!!
Great example of humour being funnier when not based on politics, current affairs or race.
Another one of the showbiz greats taken far to soon. Rip Sean
A tragedy to no longer have this amazingly talented and genuine person in this world. RIP Sean, you will always be remembered.
He was a genius so so funny RIP still gutted now
The truest and saddest of facts is that the geniuses leave us early.
Rest in peace you utterly brilliant madman.
A truly funny man. RIP 😢
😢🤣😢🤣😢. What a truly hilarious human being.
RIP you absolute legend 😢
I wish they put the "challenging wank" clip in, absolute legend and one-of-a-kind comedian.
Rectum of the year makes me cry everytime
RIP Sean A truly funny man
I never knew he was ill... Ill miss him alot. RIP you cheeky bastard!
Why cut the “seal clubbing” bit? Also, Claudia reacts to Sean as I do—hysterically!
Great brain ,legend
Fantastic man on screen, sad loss to the world
Oh, I am really going to miss him :)
Bless this gent! One of the greatest in my book….. gutted.
Surely brilliant from my generation, so witty, dry and funny...those angels must be pissing them self's now🙏🤗👌😂😂😂
My thoughts go out to his family, they should take comfort in the fact that Sean was loved by so many people and fellow comedians. RIP Sean, your style of comedy will be missed, but when we’re feeling down we can look online and find your many videos and laugh once again.
Rest in paradise your beautiful beautiful man 💔💔💔
Was really shocked to hear of his passing……he was the best on Eight out of Ten Cats…..so,so sad. RIP Sean.
Devastating loss. 🕊
A man I always had time for. A wonderful astute comedian without resorting to (too much) snarky political digs.
RIP Sean. Still laughing at your jokes... what a gift x x x
Rest in peace! You have made me cry in laughter and in your passing!
OMG 😲 Just found this ...  RIP you super hilarious legend
I sincerly hope he had just a small inkling of how much he was loved and how much he'll be missed.
Will be missed. Hilarious man.
Great talent will be sorely missed. Rest in peace Sean lock.
Absolutely gutted. Loved watching Sean on cats countdown. So talented and funny
I first came across Sean after unintentionally watching an episode of 15 Storeys High (highly recommend). Became an instant fan and was startstruck when I bumped into him at my local Sainsbury's a few months later. Wish I made a better impression on him to strike up a friendship! A massive loss for comedy. Thoughts are with his young family. RIP Sean
A class act! beat that you woke crowd and snowflakes.
Gutted when I heard the news ,a very funny comedian,loved  that show 2 ,
Oh Sean. You always bring me so many laughs. You'll be truly missed :(
RIP You Legend
Broken, just broken
RIP you legend. Really gonna miss you man. <3
When Jimmy Carr ask what the definition of Sean Lock is it has to be hilarious surely  He will be missed
Such a shame, funny, but  also a lovely man, that sense of humour was unique..I loved every minute of his material..god rest his soul
Bloke was naturally hilarious loved him. RIP a true legend
Oh, well.
The Legend, will be missed.
Now I'll never get to watch Nazi Island :(
Rip Sean ❤️
What a loss! I love how Claudia is losing it in this video! Sean will be missed!  " A challeging wank" Hillarious! One of the greatest ever! Cheers from Landskrona, Sweden
Thank You for all your comedy genius you have brought to so many, my condolences to all of his family💚

Gutted! He was a very original comic. RIP 🙏
Hilarious man. RIP my good sir.

Only one word can describe him. GENIUS
What a beautiful sensation and idea! RIP
R.I.P legend 🙌 👏 ❤

RIP mr Lock. You spread laughter all over the world.
So sad hearing his voice going out. But then again, it did so not with a whimper but with a "FFFFFFFUCK YOOOOOU". We all laughed.
How can 370 people dislike this
I am genuinely gutted! One of, if not ,the funniest comedian on telly! No fucks given,will be sadly missed!
What a guy . What a loss .far to young
Rest in peace. Thank you for bringing up Jimmy’s tax controversy at every opportunity.
Well this sucks. Just wanted to listen to some music and saw this on the homepage, first thinking he left the show or something but damn...
RIP - great guy
The over 2.5 million views in such a short period of time show what a class geeza Sean was
RIP
The greatest loss to British Comedy. May the bugger rest in peace.
He’s such a goddamn comedy genius. Such a loss.
Couldn't believe it when I heard the news
RIP legend
RIP Sean, very unique humour. You will be sorely missed! Thank you for all the laughs ....
First saw him on QI, easily became one of my favourite comedians on that show and other panel shows. Excellent sense of humour - so many uniquely, funny moments. I was so surprised by his death. Was such a major part of UK comedy, that you felt you knew him.
one of the greatest again that has left us way too soon... thanx for you happiness 😘
" To Brian and Margaret, Merry Christmas you pair of tossers , From Sean next door "  Sean lock - Comedy Legend
Strong finish there Sean 👊🏼😂
Surprised to hear. Teared up. Now binge watching anything Sean Lock. Love his dry sense of humour. One of a kind❤️
Always had me in stitches, dry and very funny!! Will be missed.....
...so fuckin funny...
My favourite Sean Lock line is "That's a challenging wank" with regards to Rachel wearing her horned helmet when she wants to be incognito. God Bless Sean.
I'm sure Jennifer Metcalfe (Mercedes from Hollyoaks) remembers Sean warmly.
never funny , i wish him the same as he wished thatcher
What an incredible comedian....!!!!!!!!!!! With out a shadow of a doubt, my favourite of all time. Such a legend. Will miss him soooooooo much. Rip Sean
Great comedian, truly unique, will miss seeing him on tv, rip Sean ❤️
Brilliant man and sorely missed R. I. P
Heaven will now be a funnier place!
Was he vaxed?
Rest in peace, you wonderfully weird man ❤️❤️
Rip Sean. Comedy genius.
Is it just me, or has this still not sunk in yet? Watching clips of Sean for the past two days laughing and feeling sad,but at the same time, expecting to see him on the next season of 8 of 10.:(
One of the funniest comedians on TV. Rest in peace you legend!
Our loss, the after life’s gain.
RIP Sean
Really sad about this human 😢  I didnt know him personally but for some reason this got to me, he always seemed so healthy and full of life and he was so easy to watch and laugh along with. So so sad and that word doesn't seem to do it justice 😢
Tears of laughter running down my cheeks, pretty sure that's the way he would want it to be 🙂
I was literally watching an old episode of countdown last night I had No idea it was him who had passed
Gutted.
watching Sean Lock late at night, laughing my ass off is a great way of unwinding after a hectic day, what a wonderful man. Will miss him terribly
He always got more airtime on Cats does Countdown  I'm so glad he did now  RIP Sean
R.I.P. 😓
Who remembers the time he ate all those fucking whelks?
The scattered desert overwhelmingly return because protest similarly repair abaft a marked soccer. available, needy conga
rip
Sad news indeed. A talented comedian, he's had me in stitches. My condolences to his family and friends.
These clips just hit different now, RIP to one of the best
Love you Sean.

a sad loss, smart, happy and clever, a fun part of about a year finding these shows on youtube
Rip Sean such a loss
RIP
If you downvoted this you're a fucking turd. Rest in peace Sean.
Thank you Sean, for all the laughs and belly aches.  You will never know how many time you've helped me through dark days.  You will be greatly missed.    From, Michigan, USA
The only man that can make me piss myself laughing... and sometimes a bit of poo.
RIP you absolute legend
What a legend, will be missed by many! R.I.P Sean you were one of my favourites 😞
Legend
I thank this man for making many a dull day bloody hilarious may you rest in peace Sean 🙏
He didn’t have a funny bone , he had a whole ‘funny’ skeleton 🤩😂🙏🏼
I was actually annoyed when I heard, there's so many dickheads in public life, why do cool people who actually do something useful like make you laugh like a drain have to peg it. The title of one of his stand up videos ...'Keep it light - Sean' ... had me smiling before I even watched it. RIP Lockie. Respect to his loved ones. xx
I’m going to miss his comedy, what a loss!
What a legend 🤣🤣🤣
RIP.Gone to soon.
Rip Sean, thank you for bringing laughter and joy to our hearts. 💔
Good journey you fantastic bastard.
Will miss this man
RIP Sean
RIP 😪😪
This man is respected by many generations in the UK, and rightly so. Rest In Peace, Sean Lock
My favourite comedian for 20 years, I left work when I heard the news, no joke.
Can someone release a  hot tarmac and vets flannel candle in memory of sean to raise money to fight cancer or something
Trying to think of a time when Sean Lock appeared on a TV show and didn't make me laugh? Hmmm, nope. It was every time. RIP Shaun.
It was the whelks that killed him.
2:14 Sean has made us feel like Rachel oh so many times. rest in paradise
Rest Happy Sean. Damn you made us laugh.😇😊🤪🥸😎
Rest in peace Sean. Legend. You will be missed.
You know  when they say “what celebrities death effected you the most”  This man. His Witt and unusual humour was genius, I’ll miss seeing him on panel shows.
Brilliant man
Such a funny guy.
“I’m a sensation” you are 🥺
Your an absolute genius Sean. I don't know how many times you had me in tears, with a pain in my face from laughing so much. Now the pain is in my throat after re watering clips. There will never be another like you. Thanks for the laughs ❤
Hands down one of the best comics ever RIP Sean you will be so missed

Such sad news. RIP Sean
He can have a rematch with Maradonna in Heaven.  RIP Sean, you were absolutely hilarious!!!

When I was going through my worst times, I would watch these clips and they always made me cry with laughter.. Thank you Sean for those moments and now they're going to be laughing with you where ever you're going next..
Sad news indeed.
Claudia wet herself little right at the end there. Thanks Sean and condolences to your family x

4:59 - Was he sick here?
You were a comic genius, I and many thousands benefited from your weird and wonderful mind. You Sir shall be sorely missed. R.I.P.
My uncle use to gig with Sean...very left field and will be greatly missed!  He was a very private man and never really said anything about his cancer...to any one that followed Sean, we kinda guessed due to your voice changing. We love you and you will be greatly missed! I lost a dear neighbour to cancer last week so this is very close to my heart and support cancer research. God bless you Sean for the many years of laughter you provided.
Rest In Peace deliverer of joyous moments ❤️🙏🏼
Great comic will be greatly missed
RIP legend 👏🙌❤️
I miss him already
Look at Winkleman and Carr at 5.28. Crying tears of laughter. What a legend.
Devastated. So uniquely funny and you never knew where he was heading with a joke. R.I.P. Sir Lock
we all have a time where sean lock has made us laugh
This breaks my heart.  I love this Man. Such a deep feeling of loss. I wish I had discovered Him sooner, but I found Him when He could bring me healing through His comedy. You are a talented beautiful soul and a true Blessing.
R.I.P. Sean. Thanks for the giggles.
I remember the 1st time I saw him live in Edinburgh at the guided Balloon theatre,  he was about 24..hilarious then too..
RIP you legend of comedy.
Wait. What? When! Omg.. where tf have i been!
Can't believe it..so sad 😞
I think he’s right!  No words could describe him For me 2 Greats! Rick Mayall and Sean lock  Just brilliant
I am shocked. I did just hear it now
RIP Friday night's will never be the same x
@Azonic, and if were Piers Morgan, I'd allow it!
Rest easy big man
Fuck I didn't even know he was ill, this really sucks
Vale, brought so much joy... can someone explain 347 dislikes
RIP <3
A sad loss. X
RIP. Such a unique, genius style of humour that can't be replaced. Condolences to his family.  I hope the fact that he brought laughter to so many, and helped people through tough times, makes them very proud. I'm sure it does.
RIP, one of my favorite panel show comedians in the UK :(

RIP Sean.  A curse onto the twats that downvoted this video.
Ever since I was little and watched "To the Manor Born" and "Yes, Minister" with subtitles on Norwegian television I have loved British comedy, but no one has had me crying and roaring with laughter like Sean. So glad I got to see him perform live here in Oslo. His talent went way beyond "being funny". RIP Sean, you were the greatest.
Fern Cotton disliked this 300+ times...shame on you Fern.  We will miss you Sean!

What a treasure
I hope you found a good pub up there, Sean. And lots of people to screw with. But just in case you reincarnated, I'll keep some bird seed on me.
honestly gutted, such talent
too soon, Sean, too soon
The dictionary does have enough words. In fact, just one will do: LEGEND
RIP Mr. Lock
RIP  The OG Dad
He will be very much missed. Thanks for the small tribute to his talent.
such a funny guy, loved watching him. RIP
As a Canadian, my introduction to Sean was through clips of 8 out of 10 cats on YouTube. Since then my love for British comedy shows has been sparked and I have found that Sean was such a class act man. He will be missed by many for sure! Cheers to *with "water"* Sean!
You should've included his A-Z clothes. That was the ultimate Sean lock highlight for me! Will miss you, you wonderfully crazy man!
“When I die I want to go in my sleep like my grandfather did...  And not screaming, like his passengers were.”  RIP Sean.
Rest in peace 🙏🏻😭
Rip legend

R.I.P SIR.......
So sad 😢 tv will never be the same again, especially on 8 out of 10 cats😫
From me to his family and friends.  I loved him for his joy of life, and every thing that made me smile.
RIP
"I don't even want a funeral. I've worked out that after I die, I want to be fly-tipped. I like the idea that I'll be annoying people even after I die"
I am in shock. You will be missed and never forgotten.  Rest In Peace
The young eel phylogentically reflect because invention unintentionally guide barring a jobless animal. oafish, helpless pumpkin
I just can't believe it. I was so shocked when I saw the news. Condolences to all his family and friends x
RIP to the funniest comedian of all time. Sleep sweet, you funny bastard
Huge loss
a huge loss to the world of comedy, to smiles and laughter. R.I.P. you legend and I m sure with you there, heaven is laughing its socks off.
Legend RIP
R.I.P
Didn't think I could ever get upset about someone I have never met before. I just expected to always see him on TV making me laugh. What an utter legend. R.I.P Sean
While watching this I completely forget he died. I was thinking I would love to see some new episodes. Hard to realize that won't happen ever again. Brilliant comedian and will be missed.
what's with all the porno spamming on here??I mean wtf??  can everyone report them?
Rest in peace Sean, such a hilarious bloke, such a loss.
Going to miss him....
:*
Such a funny guy, so sad 😞 RIP
One of the funniest blokes I've ever come across. Could listen to him tell the same joke over and over and still laugh every time. Will be sorely missed.
We'll never again experience the magic of carrot in a box
Condolences  to His Wife and children Brilliant  Talent. Rest In peace.
Genuinely crying my eyes out. Our 3rd child (Silas) was conceived directly after your show in Crawley in 2019! We will always love you. Love from John, Michelle, Silas, Isla and Evelyn. They have grown up watching you too!
You can't write tears Jimmy
What an amazing man and comedian
R.i.p Sean lock 😇
What a sad time, gone to soon sadly
this is so heartbreaking, a great man and comic. rip <3
I love i.t at 5:02 onwards Claudia is crying uncontrollably and begging him to stop 🤣  even jimmy is wiping away tears of laughter. It's hard to make your fellow professionals crack up, unless you were Sean😂😂
Wtf what happened 👀
Thank you for the laughs Sean.
I didn't know he died until the video ended what the fuck and it said RIP what the fuck....
Never going to be the same without him, a true comedian who could always think on his toes. He will be missed
Sean I know you wont see this.... But i would like to tell you that "you brought more joy to my life then i did" Rest in peace! you magnificent man........
an effortlessly funny guy. Massive loss. RIP xx
RIP...comic genius
"If I could have my ashes spread anywhere I wanted, I'd have them spread in Piers Morgan's eyes."
It just won’t be the same watching 8 out of 10 cats without you. Thanks for all the laughter you brought us over the years. RIP Sean
How the fuck is this even real? Sean Lock, Helen McCrory, Paul Ritter.. Who else will this stupid year rob us of. Meanwhile, orange clowns are still alive and no brexiteers ever had to deal with fallout of the lie.
top top man.x
Comic timing genius. Now him and Maradona can pick up where they left off in rectum of the year world championship.  Go England!
Today I went to a local vet, took their flannel, and spread it on hot tarmac.  Inhaling the scent of Sean definitely helped in calming my sadness from his passing.  He was right all along.
Incredible how many clips there are of him that just make you absolutely cry with laughter, what a truly incredible comedian who's gonna be sorely missed. RIP to a one of a kind.
Absolutely hilarious and clearly loved by all whom worked with him and those of us that appreciated his comic timing and genius!!  RIP Sean 💙
RIP sean true british legend you will be missed.
I'm from the Netherlands, and know this man from TV. Sorry for his lost, he will be missed. I know I will miss him.
Its from a canal lol
He said he doesn't care what the eulogy says, but ideally he'd like it to say "Noooooooooo! Whyyyyyyyyy! Nooooooooo! Aaaaaaah!"
God may he rest well and bless his family 🙏
Rest in Peace to one of my favourite comedians. I discovered you through the Channel4 Highlight videos, as I do not see Countdown as I am Australian (We have Numbers and Letters. Same show, dumb name). I instantly got hooked and binged a bunch of Sean Videos. It truly saddens me to know we wont get any more of those. Thank you Sean. You will live on forever.
What a great man. Thankyou for always making me smile 😃 RIP
RIP Sean. You were so incredibly funny and talented. ❤
My grandma died the same day. I really hate this
Such a great comedian and a sad loss. Last week I was watching an old video on YouTube of him roasting Bruce Forsythe, absolutely brilliant. Rip sean.  His wife ask...what are you thinking Sean? I'm trying to imaging a world without any herbs. The trains ran on time...... Pmsl
NOOOO!!! AAAHHHH!!! WHYYYYYYYYYY????!!!!       You can't write tears Jimmy.   RIP Sean
"you can't write tears Jimmy"
Very sad 😢😢
Legend!
What a wonderful man, rest in peace sir 🙏🏼🍻
R I P. Thanks for all the laughs!
Wasnt aware of him having cancer at all, heart breaking, no words.
Rest in Peace
Very surprised by this, because he didn't seem very old.
Bless Rip
Always had me in stitches. RIP Sean x
I watched this vedio in trending and 🙄
Absolute Genius RIP x
I only discovered Sean and 8oo10cdc in the last couple years, but quickly grew to love the show and the entire cast. RIP Sean Lock, you will be missed.
Reminds me off my dad
When my mate told me the news of Mr Lock's passing, I hurt inside. As someone who aspires to be a funnyman of the sorts, we've all lost a great man, a legend in fact. No one can or will ever replace him.
A huge loss for comedy, one of the world's funniest people. RiP.
All he wanted was another carrot!
What a funny man. Sad times 😔
One of my favourite comedians my thoughts are with his family rip funny man 🥲🥲
Thanks
RIP Sean ,you Hilarious man. My Condolences to the Family & Friends.  (22.4.1963-18.8.2021)
He was so great! Such a loss, sending love to his wife and children 💔💔💔
You know your a great comedian when you span generations, my son loved Sean and so did I, we loved watching Countdown and both being able to relate to his humour ❤️
A genuinely funny guy who'll be missed. RIP lad.
I'm gonna miss him... RIP
What an amazing person, gone too soon :(
RIP thank you for making us laugh and giving us all so much joy.
Sean was genuinely funny and could actually make people laugh.
I woke up this morning and was signing "if you want to get a tapeworm eat some pork" 😂 Rip you amazing, funny man
Brilliant humour. Carrot in a Box is a classic. We'll all miss him.
I genuinely am so heartbroken at the loss of him - it is sad we won’t get anymore material from him, but what upsets me more is the knowledge that his family & friends won’t get any more experiences with him - Rest in Peace Sean
Absolute legend! RIP you brilliant man
Why rip
Rest in peace 💙
RIP Sean, Gonna miss your laughs
This guy made me laugh till i cried! He will be sorely missed. Comedy genius!
❤
Unbelievably sad, such a funny man - he will be missed massively, though perhaps not so much as the money he embezzled from the RNLI I wonder......genius!!! RIP
I just imagine Sean and Riy Mayall telling jokes to each and taking the piss out of us down 'ear
Timing, delivery, phrasing, storytelling, all at genius level. A serious loss to this planet. RIP, Sean.
Rest easy sweet.  💔  going to miss you and your cheeky 😜 sense of humour 😉.  Going to have to watch on demand now as it's not going to be the same 💯💔😪. You just put on the show of your life up there now fella.  You are going to be missed so dearly by everyone.  Thoughts are with your family right now at this very sad time.  Thoughts and prayers 🙏 😌 💔 guys.  Xx
God this video made me laugh! What an incredible comedian
I loved him in QI, every time he was in the programme, it was always hilarious and I had cramps from laughing.
Someone I don't know made me tear with laughter and now tear in sadness. Thank you for making me smile time and time again. The laughter just won't feel the same anymore. Rest in peace Sean x
Farewell Sean!
Legend
Rest in Peace. An absolute staple in the art of comedy!
RIP. You were a living joy.
Thanks for the laugh's Sean. RIP, Mate. A life well lived.
“I once slowed down for a horse.”  He will be missed. A one off .
Rip to a legend!
I have pissed myself laughing to this dude's fast wit and brilliant humor for the past few years and I'm genuinely heartbroken that he's gone. I guess the only way to process it is by jam packing a shit ton of his compilations into the next few hours. Where I still won't be able to comprehend that he's gone 😅 My love and condolences to his friends and family xo
RIP Sean.
So funny..genius understated comic.He'll be sadly missed.
After all the viewers and ad revenue sean has brought you, the best you can do is this, the BBC had a better tribute and he worked for you?  Disgusting!
One of the all time greats. RIP, Sean.
As soon as I heard about his passing and his cause of death I remembered him joking about the difficulty of caring for your skin whilst working on a building site “ ohhh Mick you wouldn’t be a poppet and rub some ambre solaire on my back would you” 🤣🤣🤣. In retrospect it’s a bit sad but he was a hilarious man, he would sometimes go off on a mad tangent but it was always funny. Unfortunately never got the chance to see him live though and wish I had. RIP
Always remarkable! We will miss you Sean!
So gutted Sean is gone, this is the first time in my life I’ve left genuinely sad at the passing of someone I didn’t know personally. And that shows just how incredible of a man and a comedian he was. To have such a big impact on so many people! RIP Sean
Just found out RIP. He is the goat
The mouse trap gag has me in bits every time. So simple 🤣
Provided much joy mate. Best of luck with it all an that. Let us know how you get on!✌🏽❤️
great first joke-with cannel 4 and 8 out of 10 cat  there was  a fair  chance  he  might spell the word we know hes hinting  at.a very gentle witty comedian
You will be dearly missed Sean. Rest in peace and make the people on the other side smile and laugh like you made us do.
Ah yes, what a monumental tribute. 6 minutes of random clips from one programme. What cunt put this up?
Rip
😥💔
What a gr8 loss to the comedy world.
RIP Sean. You will be missed.
R.I.P Sean 'Rectum of the Year' Lock
Legend! 🥃
So very very saddened by the loss of one of the best comedians in the world. Goodbye Sean. RIP
So good 🤣 Hope you are well in whatever comes next Sean. We take things for granted too much. Think of the millions of people who he has made laugh, its amazing
He was okay but how could he associate himself with Riley?
Absolutely brilliant comedian, his delivery on jokes was always absolutely on point. Always had me in stitches
RIP Sean. You will be missed, but always remembered.  Love goes to his wife and three children.
you were my comedy hero sean
You will be missed Sean RIP mate
So sad 😞
I was enjoying that until the tragic reminder of his passing. You'll missed by all, Mate <3
Nooooooooo.. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy... i guess he said, ill be off in the morning
Far too young, such a clever man, blessed with straight out spontaneous humourous wit. Will be missed by so many. Condolences to his family and friends.
One of the greatest British comedians. Such a shame really.
Well, that fucking sucks, doesn't it? Sean's dead?!
This is an excellent selection that would be weird and possibly inappropriate for anyone else's memorial video, but for Sean this really feels perfect - I was more saddened by the news than I expected, and this put a bittersweet smile on my face  Sean Lock was right - he WAS more of a sensation than someone that could be described with all the words in the dictionary
oh man i did,nt even know he was ill ,sad
You where good soldier real good maybe even the best… rip u glorious man
Sean was the man.  What a loss :-(
RIP Sean. Such a wonderful soul you were. Enjoyed every bit of your work❤️
Miss you Sean. Such a good comedian. Thank you for cheering us all up.
The world is a lesser place now, but I am glad to have been laughing my ar.. of, from his humor. RIP
"Carrot in a box" cured my depression. Thank you for all the laughs. May you rest in peace 💕
Why would you cut out the seal clubbing bit from the last segment, you wouldn't rip Mona Lisas gob of, would you Channel 4? Dont't do this legend dirty like that.
This man was responsible for my sense of humour and I'll never forget him for that. RIP and thanks for everything Sean
This video was no where near long enough! RIP to one of the greats! One of the funniest men to ever grace our screens and stages. The world is less funny now. And I can’t help but think how ridiculous you would find all these videos and comments!
rewatching 15 storeys high in his honour. 😔 rest in peace sean  ❤️
My sincerest condolences to Sean’s family and friends, he will be missed by many. He brought a tear to my eye through laughter many a time. Think of him and smile.
I still remember a live set from years ago with a routine about the neighbour's budgie - true genius - but it doesn't seem to be on youtube anywhere.  (And I've binged several this last couple of days.  Tears of laughter only, of course.)   Probably the greatest comic of his generation - I can't think of anyone who comes close - Alexei Sayle on a good day, Bill Bailey on occasion, but no one as consistent as Sean Lock.  He just had the instinct, the fully developed comic intelligence.
A massive loss 💔♥️♥️♥️
That’s a hard wank.
I watched last night's tribute  where Sean did stand up gig in Margate.  VERY funny!  OMG the strawberry jam and 'third wank of the day'  gag...LOL!!!  R.I.P SEAN LOCK.
The funniest man ever 🥰
Love from India, hope you reincarnate as a Viking..So wank wouldn't be challenging man!
RIP
Nooooooooo! Whyyyyyyyyy! Old geezer, I’ll miss you.
I just like to imagine that Sean, Robin Williams, Joan Rivers, Sean Hughes and George Carlin are having some kind of a comedy party, a comedy-off somewhere on the other side and it makes me a bit less sad.
RIP to a legend, British comedy will never be the same again
Will have this on repeat and never get bored and will always wind being in fits of laughter. One of the funniest people ever and will be massively missed
I've been crying for hours over this beautiful man
What a beautiful, kind, witty and funny man. Thanks for all the laughs Sean, RIP and all the best to your family and friends ❤
a stunningly clever and hilarious man... we are so fortunate to have known his humour - such a loss, for many reasons...
There wont be another Carrot in the Box with Jon :(
RIP Sean
F
Just found out, man this is beyond tragic, i remember going on countdown clip binges and Sean would never fail to make me cry laughing. RIP to the legend

RIP Sean you hilarious man, A bonafide British legend, your jokes and humor will live on through us for years to come
One of the greats. So sad to hear of his passing.
I cant believe he's gone, he was discrete about his diagnosis either because he wasn't comfortable sharing or didnt want us to worry 😭 R.I.P you bloody legend i loved your personality and comedy
Absolutely devastated, one of my favourite comedians. Gone, REST IN PEACE, friend ❤
Lock is a comedy genius. Massive loss in the comedy world. RIP LOCKY 👓
RIP to the Carrot King!❤️
A heartbreaking loss to the entire nation. We love and miss you Sean, R.I.P.
Thanks for all the laughs, mate.
RIP Sean Lock. A legend.
Such a funny man..R.I.P and thanks
RIP thanks for the laughs.
we've had enough shit this year and now this?
"If I could have my ashes spread anywhere I wanted, I'd have them spread in Piers Morgan's eyes."
Awash with emotion, actually struggling to process this.
336 people disliked a tribute to someone who has died. WTF!!!
Thank you for all the laughs Shaun, you made the world a funnier place to be.
Even though I'm older than him he was like that hilarious uncle you have. I was on the heart ward when I saw that rectum monologue. The nurses were pretty worried for few of us. Brilliant mind.
rip
Who is he talking about when he says "I have beaten....... Hers is messed up"
Seriously the only show I regularly watch. Sean Lock we salute you.
No one will forget him because no one even knew who he was.
Thanks for all the laughs, RIP
HOW CAN ANYONE DISLIKE THIS  HES A LEGEND
I didnt know he pass away until i saw this video. I love him in countdown. RIP Sean. God Bless you
Thank you for all of the laughs Sean!! We sorely miss you!!
Sean Lock was always a favourite, I loved his  boss level mastery of slapstick. Such a sad loss and way too young.
One of Britain's finest comedians such a unique character, never laughed so much watching this man will be sadly missed..... 8 out of 10 cats will never be the same .
Only found out last night, will be greatly missed, one of my favourites.
So far 335 really SAD fuckers...
RIP
RIP Benny Harvey Miss you big man
Hilarious one liners/stories. Great comic. Lovely man. Brought such joy and laughter to millions.
Rest in peace, forever missed.
Genius. RIP.
Panel shows will never be the same.
holy shit i had no idea he'd passed until i saw this, i just thought it was a different sean lock comp vid omg
RIP you legend!
Oh will be sadly missed you funny man 😢
Funny man. Will be missed.
Uniquely funny. Gone to soon but forever remembered. Thank you for the countless belly laughs Sean.
The saddest part is now Jon can never take the Carrot-in-a-box Grand Champion title away from him. Thanks for the laughs old geezer
RIP , gone too soon Sean.
"I beat Fearne Cotton"
Rest in peace
Fuck me I'm gonna miss him
One of my favourite comedians, when I saw the news I was in tears. You have gave something amazing to the world, with laughter and joy. RIP you legend
I didn’t  realise I would be so affected buy a comedian’s passing, but I’m truly saddened by this. I feel there is something so special about comedy, in that they make you feel so happy, that you feel a real connection with the artists. I have countless times watched and almost pissed myself to Sean’s effortless hysteria , that it almost seems surreal of this tragedy. I would definitely have the same reaction to some of my other comic idols , if that were to happen to them . The world is becoming ever so quickly a barrage of negativity, comedians break the mould of this sad fact. R,I,P you bloody legend, gone but never forgotten. I hope there is a carrot In your box when you get there, if there is a there. Much love xo
One of the funniest men in history r.i.p. and my thoughts are with his family God bless
A unique talent. I don't there was a moment where I DIDN'T laugh at what he came out with.  From a personal perspective I will miss him on programmes like this.  You were guaranteed laughs with him.  Rest well Sean. Thank you for the laughs.
RIP Good sir, absolute legend.
Thats a challenging wank was classic🤣🤣
2:34 James Corden addicted to his phone as usual. Does this at awards shows and commercial breaks on his show.
Rip Sean. He made us piss ourselves laughing 😂 😂 😂 ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥
I miss Sean special on count when says to Rachel in the Maths round I am watching 8 out 10 cats does countdown now on SBS viceland channel Here in Australia Tasmania R.i.p Sean
You made me laugh, Sean. Thankyou.
Such a funny man sitting next to the amazingly unfunny Trevor Noah doesn't makes sense to me
Sean was the main reason I watched the show, gutted that he’s gone.
I still can't believe it's real, I wasn't even aware he was poorly. He certainly looked younger than his age. Very funny guy, a bit loss to the comedian circuit and panel shows alike.
I dont do tributes...albeit many great people having passed on in recent times. But God....this is painful! This loss is just gut wrenching. This is guna take a while to sink in 😩.
Who ever disliked this video should go to hell
This show will not be the same without you. I'll miss you Sean
Great man truly great never know what's going to come out if his mouth very funny stand up still remember the times in this show he and miles jupp great parts very funny got me laughing uncontrollablely great man on channel 4 truly and on stand up gigs like live at the apollo.  Rest in peace you comedy legend and may other stand ups both new and old remember him
Rest In Peace Sean ✝️
When so much truth is spoken and its as funny as fcuk    Wow     RIP
Thankyou Sean for all the laughter you bought out in me. God bless and condolences to your nearest and dearest.
I loved his sense of humour .. great comedian and a great loss. R.I.P
literally crying. 8 Out of 10 Cats literally single handly got me through one of the hardest periods of my depression. Thank you for the laughs, thank you for the joy and thank you for putting a smile on my face in the hardest of times.
I just can't believe it 🥺
I watched this guy every night on 8 out of ten cats
Proof that the good die young (ish) a massive loss that will never be repeated 😪
Incredibly sad. The amount of views on this tribute says something. 2.4m in one day.
cya Sean.. you'll be missed mate :(
RIP -- that is all
God bless mate ,you were a fuking champ.
Sean will always be remembered for the immortal line of "That's a challenging wank!" directed towards Rachel Riley. Sean, we salute you!!
We need to create the Shaun lock perfume the smell essence of tarmac
Sympathies to your family and loved ones. A true legend. RIP
Legend
❤️
Thanks for posting this video, although it is very limited with regards to purely exhibiting his 8 out of 10 cats does countdown appearances, it still gives a great glimpse into Sean's special brand of comedy genius. I've been utterly saddened by the world's loss losing Sean. There haven't been many times in my life when I've cried with laughter and sadness at the same time. RIP Sean Lock, you'll be dearly missed by millions.
Comic Legend, no more & no less! R.I.P.
He passed away from cancer. R.I.P sir
A sad loss indeed, but had he had a recent jibby jibby too.
These clips of Sean makes up a great combination of tears and laughter, only this time the laughter's not there.  RIP Sean You will be missed.
His joke about beating a budgie with a spoon still has me on the floor every time 😅
R.I.P. Sean.  ‘Coming hone to a full mousetrap!’ 😂😂😂
I can't believe how moved I was when I heard about Sean's passing. Truely a funny man. My best bits were him eating the Welks and telling Rachel Riley she is a challenging wank. Thanks Sean. You're going to be missec
An absolute king of comedy. There were none like him, nor will there ever be. Thanks for the many many laughs, Sean.
Shaun Unlocked 🙏
RIP Sean  ,you have been in our living room most nights of the week 🍻
Wow 5 mines tribute... Could have done alot better than that he was a legend with hours worth of comedy to tribute too.

❤
The whelks sure took their time... Thank you for the laughs Mr Lock. Godspeed.
I stumbled upon this vid on facebook, and watched it to the end without reading the description. I cried.  I love you Sean. RIP.
The good ones go early.Proof that Jeremy Clarkson is immortal.
Been watching all his clips on YT for the last few days.... nothing new, I often watch Sean anytime I need cheering up. I still laugh but with sadness in the background. A massive loss for us all and he won't be replaced for a long long time.
Always put a smile on my face. Just noticed now, bit weird how much the audience laughs. Laugh track?
Nag Ou Grote !!
R.I.P Sean Lock, funniest man in comedy and the world is a little less funny without him. You will be missed
I'm crying as I'm laughing, what a wonderful and funny man, we've lost a true original and a really nice genuine bloke. Farewell Sean. You are already missed
I am so pissed right now.  Sean Lock was my spirit animal, he just said whatever came into that amazing mind of his.  He made a brilliant career of it, people just shift down a seat from me...
Carrot in a box.

He made me laugh so many times for years. I will miss him
rather sad that some people dislike a video like this out of spite

Hot tarmac & a vets flannel!!!  😂🤣
If you looked up the definition in a dictionary you would find LEGENDARY COMEDIAN.
RIP sean

cheers for the laughs and good fun, Sean. Made me turn shit nights in to ones where I went to bed laughing. RIP
Thanks for the endless laughs Sean. My condolences to your loved ones.
A hero of mine. This is an extremely sad loss. RIP
The last joke was the best 😂😂😂
=(
If you want to get a tapeworm eat some pork!
<3
It’s my great sadness that we lost him and 58 seems a very young age to die
Sean will surely be missed by millions of fans who are always there to support his comedy career
Yeah he had cancer which started from his skin back then when he was a builder before turning a comedian and the cancer got worse years later after 1990
Comedic legend! A very sad day it is!
Gutted.

Love sean will be sorely missed
Legend
Sean made me laugh so often. He had a positive impact on my life. Thank you.
Any up and coming comedian should aspire to this man, just effortlessly hilarious. He must have put up a great fight ,he was making us and himself laugh to the end.
I love you, man. Always have, always will.
Rest in peace man
So sad RIP Sean
A true comedy genius. He will surely be missed.
RIP Laddie.
Sean, you've left us laughing, RIP 🙏
RIP
After recently discovering Taskmaster, I always wanted to see Sean Lock on it. We will never get that now, fuck.
r.i.p. sean! I really hope his close ones know how well he was loved by us viewers
Terrible loss to the world.
Rest In Peace Brother 🙏💙
Such a funny man. A huge loss in a world that needs humour more each day
What a great & uniquely creative comedian Sean was.  RIP, we’ll all miss this great sense of humour, but fortunately we can always revisit his huge body of work.
Nazi Island was gold.
Gutted, what a legend Sean was. RIP mate
When somebody who made you laugh so much dies the world is a sadder place..
rip legend
Such a really nice guy by all accounts, it's hard to see a guy like this pass away, fucking Cancer,  there is no way a guy like this should have been taken.. RIP, Sean, may you entertain up on high.
He's a classic man, funny as hell
He will be missed , I still can’t believe that he’s gone it really broke my heart 💔
Legendary
I'm incredibly sad to find Sean's passing. May he continue to share his humour no matter where he is. Gone too soon.
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
R.I.P Sean never a dull moment when you were on the telly, thanks for the laughter.
Rest in Peace
I thought they would have included when he was with Miles and the stuffed animal
Rest in Peace, the comedians comedian. </3
Such a big loss. So sad.
Death is a sad thing, but it’s what we deserve. Even though we deserve it, that didn’t stop Jesus from dying to take our punishment, so that we could have eternal life and not suffer. He suffered for us. Know that one day it will be too late—I plead with you to find life, this can only be given to us through Jesus and His awesome love—He.Loves.You. and in Him is our only hope❤️❤️
No, no way. This guy can't be gone. What is comedy without Sean Lock? The guy was comedy, as much as Alan Rickman was Snape. I can seriously not believe this. What a serious injury this is to proper fresh comedy.
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
RIP Sean Lock one of the best comedian I have ever seen.
A legend RIP 🙏
"That's a challenging wank." - Sean Lock.
RIP you funny bastard.  I'll miss you...
Now Jon finelly can get the carrot... Heaven is full of smiles now.
World is full of arseholes, and Sean is the one to go. Un-fucking-believable. RIP, mate.
💔❤️
I’m really going to miss this man. The gut wrenching laughter he brought to every show he was on was priceless. We love you Sean RIP.
So sad.  I was only introduced to his comedy about a year ago. Such a great style of comedy. He will be missed by all .
the sadest thing is i looked him 10 hrs before he died  and yeah it hurts
RIP - I absolutely loved him playing "Carrot in the box" against Jon
R.I.P Sean, I was shocked when I heard you died at 58, thanks for all the laughs and good times. Best wishes to his family and friends.
This man made me smile and laugh often. The world needs the type of joy he brought into people's lives and he will be missed.
RIP :\
This is so sad, I'm shocked he's gone. One of my favourite comedians for sure. So good to hear the love so many have for him in these comments. Vale Sean Lock.
Brilliant and talented comedian, perfect mixture of timing and dry humour. It's sad when anyone passes, but when a person who brought so much laughter into a world where laughter is often hard to find passes away it is a tragedy.
Just the funniest guy RIP Sean
Rest easy you surly bastard. You brought this American so much joy and laughter. My heart hurts.
Absolute legend, such devastating news. R.I.P 😢
Hope you’re up there somewhere cursing out Toblerone, Sean Lock! Rest In Peace 💕
Loved you Sean!
Comic genius!  The 300 odd people who didn't like this, need to rethink their life choices.
I'd always notice when Sean wasn't on a panel for a show, something was always lacking. Pretty sobering to think it'll always be missing now. May Piers Morgan's eyes ever be gritty.
Thank you Sean
No Lock? Unacceptable!
From one Sean to another, R.I.P.
Legend
😘😘😃
RIP to the greatest carrot in a box player of all time
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Never thought he'd make cry,and it wouldn't be because of laughing so hard..R.I.P
Rectum of the year 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you'll be missed
The carrot in a box invincible champion❤
The carrot is in the box now. :(
R.I.P to an absolute legend, comedy won't be the same without you. Thank you for everything Sean.
Sean was great. First discovered him on 8 Out of 10 Cats and he is one of the reasons I became addicted to watching panel shows from the UK. Majority of the laughter I've enjoyed over the last 6-7 years is probably because of these panel shows.
Damn -I can't stop crying.
I still can’t believe it. Like I genuinely can not wrap my mind around it. Legitimately feeling exactly the same way when Chadwick Boseman passed, I am just so shocked.
What an absolute legend. I can’t think of a more unique comedian, you never knew what was going to come out of his mouth and that’s what made him so special. Rest in peace Sean
I've watched Cats Does Countdown for a few years on the YouTubes and this Canadian will miss Sean so very much.
Rest In Peace Brother.
rip
Tragic loss. Sean should have lived long enough to become one of England's most beloved curmudgeons.
Sitting here 😂😂 then 😭😭. Very funny guy and very likeable as well 🥲🥲
Truely an Absolute Legend R.I.P. <3
Absolutely gutted when I learned of Sean's passing. He had a brilliant mind. I will miss him dearly on all my favourite shows.
RIP
Vale Sean Lock; your presence and amazing humour will be greatly missed.
What a monumental loss. I don't think any comedian has ever made me laugh as hard as he did.  Rest in peace, Sean.
What a loss to the world
Absolute legend x
I feel like a good friend has died. That much I enjoyed whatching Sean Lock!
I am so devastated by this. I'm American and none of my friends even know who he is; so I'm glad I have youse guys to remember him with. 💙
“Hot tarmac and a vets flannel”.. the world has lost a helluva talent.. comedic genius and then some. God speed
does this mean we can add the definition of Sean Lock into the dictionary?
Going into this video, I just expected a compilation for a birthday or some sort of an anniversary. Never did I think it would be a tribute in the truest sense. I am heartbroken. British panel shows and comedy has been through me through my entire teens and twenties. The fact that he is no more when I just watched a panel with him last night on youtube is surreal. Gone but mever forgotten. The laughs you gave us will forever remain as wonderful memories in time. Thank you, Sean and may your soul rest in peace.
A true comic genius, he has left his mark on the world. RIP Sean Lock
Rest in peace, you glorious bastard.
Thanks for the years of laughter.
Wowowow wtf?!..that i did not see comming😢 was he sick or anything?.I only now see how much he actually looks like Uncle Stan from Gravityfalls...🥲....he must be telling them jokes up there because it's raining tears down here.....(he prob would say something like: "we lost the Euro's to Italy any way soooo..saves me another two years living in pain inn'it?!"..🤓⛅)......Best of wishes to the family and crew...must have hit home hard😞.......🇬🇧🏴
This seems like just another montage they’ve already done before. This time they just thought they could exploit his death for more views on their YouTube channel
As if the world couldn’t get any worse!  RIP Sir Sean Lock.
Thank you very much, beautiful human!
WAIT I just saw this title on the side of something else I was watching and I was looking at it like, that’s some strange wording. Maybe he’s left the show or something. Now I’m reading the comments, he’s died!? When?! How?! *sighs* I never heard about this, holy shit. This guy was always so funny to me. :(  RIP!
He will be sorely missed.
On a selfish note I was so looking forward to Sean's post pandemic take on the state of things. RIP
Wow, truly gutted. Best wishes to the family and friends he's left behind
From America.  Sean Lock and the carrot in the box was the best ever.  Watched everythink Sean did on Youtube.
so strange that hes gone.
RIP Sean. Gonna miss your slightly left field humour.
One of the best .. to bad he had to sit next to don lemon during that one episode … Sean was the guy next door the average guy drinking a beer .. he was just a great comedic genius
Rip
Came to appreciate him far to late. RIP
RIP 😓
Почивај у миру, легендо!
A massive loss always had me laughing my favourite sketch he did was when he wanted to reanimate the leaders of the nazi party 😂😂 he was at the peak of comedy greats and will be truly missed rip Sean 💙
If there is a heaven I hope this man is there laughing
A fucking legend. RIP
A madman and a legend
RIP what a man such a loss to British comedy dont make them like hi.
R.I.P 💔
Sean's death absolutely gutted me.  And it came out of nowhere, I didn't even know he was sick.  I think, more than any other comic, I just really identified with his brand of comedy... it spoke to me.  Nothing has ever made me laugh harder that Sean trying to break the other comedians on these panel shows.  Hearing Claudia, through tears of laughter, begging someone to make him stop speaking is one of the funniest bits I've ever seen.  The world is going to be a little less vibrant without him in it.  He will be sorely missed.
I didn’t realize he died… I will miss him I discovered 8 out of 10 cats on YouTube and it quickly became one of my favorite shows and Sean was my favorite panelist.
One of the greatest who ever did it.
😔 💔
Rip
the carrot in the box  RIP
love this show
you never knew where you were going with Sean but when you got there you were smiling. Rip Sean Lock.
Well shit...
Im really sad to hear of his passing. I watched a lot of 8out of 10 cats lately and he put a big smile on my face everytime. Why are the good ones always go to young. RIP Sean Lock!
R.I.P One of the most underrated comedians, first ever comedian to perform at Wembley technically.
Thanks for the laughs Sean!
Rest in Peace you amazing funny man. X
The only comedian that truly made me cry with laughter. R.I.P you funny man you.
Nooooooooooooooo.  Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy???
absolutely heartbreaking to hear he passed.
Absolute legend. R. I. P one of the funniest around. He's more like a sensation, an idea.
Funniest comedian ever..FACT
Just stumbled upon some video in my feed "Sean Lock last video" and confused immediately searched the news. I'm so shocked he's gone. He made me cry from laughter so many times. He will be missed dearly. Rest in peace
Rip Sean you absolute legend never failed to make anyone laugh
Here I sit, broken hearted 💔, paid my pennies for laughs, only to hear, that Sean has parted.....  RIP, Sean.  You’re going to be sorely missed, by lots and lots of people, especially in these times, because the loss of your ability to make people laugh, is a terrible thing........... 😪💔😪💔😪💔😪💔😪💔😪    I really hope, that he would’ve liked my simple attempt, at toilet humour............ 😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
No-one is more gutted than Fearne Cotton, she'd been working on that for over a year...
My favorite line unplanned line of his: "I promise I won't spit on you when we have sex later" ❤️
wow i didnt kno he passed away  rip great comedian
Sean if American television had people as witty and funny as you on it then I would actually watch television. R.I.P.
RIP To the Silver Medal Rectum of the Year
One of the best, rest easy.
Condolences to his family. I hope they know how many people he made laugh.
RIP Sean Lock. He was a great comedian and seemed like a top guy.
I always liked him on Countdown.  R.I.P  Sean Locke
A very funny, clever man. He leaves a wife and three children behind. Sad for us. Tragedy for them.
How can Seal Clubbing not be included? Nazi Island?
Genuinely can’t believe he’s gone! Such a legend! A true best of would be just about every clip he’s ever made! RIP
Sean Lock's death is the first time I've felt genuinely saddened by a 'celebrity' death. What a testament to a truly comedic genius and great man who is going to be missed by all who knew and watched him.
This video is not nearly long enough !    Remake it longer and re upload you you bloody idiots
That man gave me so many laughs when I needed them RIP YOU TRUE LEGEND
Definitely going to be missed. Funny man  RIP Sean Lock
I'm in Saskatchewan, Canada, and was shocked and saddened to read of Sean's passing in this morning's local newspaper - I hope he knew how well-known and loved he was ❤️ I still can't quite believe it.
Love your content!! Stay safe everyone ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️
thank you for making me laugh when i thought nothing would, sean. may you rest in peace ❤️ xx
Noooooooooooo.  Whhyyyyyyyyyyy?  Noooooooooooo!  Aaaaaauughhhh.
R.I.P Sean very funny man
My god i didn't know he died! RIP
from eating those fucking welks
"A chance to host the MOBO awards" WTF
where are the (whole virus vaccines) or has as they say trust the science walked out of the building COME ON someone answer that one
Oh Sean , rest in peace
The first time I encountered Sean was on an episode of Qi. He was talking about how his sister had bought him a "grow your own loofah" kit. He was describing all the crap bits in the kit and then he added (totally deadpan) "I think the pot hit her the hardest". I literally burst out laughing.  He got me. And I loved him from that moment.  I think his magnum opus was "That's a difficult wank".
I can't believe he's gone.  Really gonna miss him. He's wonderful!
RIP from over in America.. Loved his comedy
This man was amazing...a legend. But seriously, what filth disliked this video...
I can't believe he's gone.  Really gonna miss him. He's wonderful!
RIP Sean, thank you for filling me with laughs I'll never forget
how does this video have any dislikes? like, what?
R.i.p by far the funniest person on countdown
Legend
:(((
seal clubbing...RIP you bloody legend
Here was a man who worked hard on his craft... Prepped and workshopped his material... Then delivered every line like it was off the cuff and you were laughing in apprehension because you knew it would be good. Decent chap too. Isn't that always the way. RIP
Fuck I miss him already
R.I.P you made my childhood
Never liked him. Him and Jupitus,  very unfunny.
One of the funniest people to have ever blessed the comedy circuit, and someone who will be so goddamn missed. As a person in the comedy scene, I’ve seen so many tributes over the last couple of days and it is clear to me how many he inspired. He may be gone, but he will never be forgotten. RIP Sean Lock, thank you for making me cry with laughter more times then I can count.
I'd like to be remembered by scent.
What a shame it took his death for me to discover this funny man's life.
I met Sean at a hotel in Barnsley where I worked. He sat in the bar with a pint and socialized with people. Down to earth and an awesome guy. Thank you for bringing laughter to the world
What a legend❤️ RIP
The clip with Claudia winkleman says it all about this man she says stop talking please
I'm laughing so hard my chest hurts,what a brilliant bloke. Rectum of the year? Funniest thing ever
we were so lucky to be able to watch him though. ill always treasure the memories of watching countdown at night and just laughing non stop. we were really blessed when he was born into this world.
<3 We will sorely miss you, Sean.
One of my favorite comics loved him on the panel shows. So funny. He'll be missed.
Legend
Simply RIP Sean
Discovered him like 2 months ago... Binged watch almost everything, and now he's gone. It's the first time I feel this for someone I never knew. But damn I admired him.
🙁
I thought it was some kind of shit joke till i googled it
Unique off the cuff legend. Sean will be locked in my heart forever 💯💫
R.I.P. Sean. The world is a sadder place now that you have gone and left us all.
;( r.i.p . grew up watching countdown with my mom and we loved him, he was always so funny
I heard the sad news in the car out with my partner delivering her Avon catalogues,  Rip Sean a true legend in the world of comedy 🙏😢
This man has had me in tears for years. The whelk eating challenge, carrott in a box, a challenging w**k, ....the list goes on. I loved watching him on 8 out of cats.....plus countdown. A bloody hilarious man. R I.P Sean Lock😇😇😇.....heaven will be a funnier place tonight❤❤
Terrible that he had to go, but at least he was with his family when he went
Gutted to have heard of your passing, RIP
I picture sean kicking gates open and tell god, thank you for keeping my seat warm🤣. There is so many people hurt with sean passing, we must make change. Why is no one in world openly trying to cure cancer, my mum died to cancer, few years ago, but every day so many familys lose there love ones to cancer. It has kill more people in last 20 years than the shambles on the news just now. We can send man to space but we have all agreed cancer can not be cured. And almost every country deals with cancer the same. And every country agrees how to treat covid and travel, how is this possible, for russia to agree but covid but at same time, there was man with big bbc camara, tell us we are close to war.🤣 we all no that is ballocks. I cant be only one thinking, yous have scared everyone from covid, but we can live with Cancer. This must be change
This is an incredibly sad loss for us all and considering most of us didn't know him, I can only begin to imagine the enormity of the void he has left in the lives of his family, friends and loved ones. Genuinely one of the greats. Here's to Sean. Cheers 🍻
damn dude.  i just wasnt ever gonna be ready for this.  this man was gem n a half.  rest easy king :(
8oo10c and bfq got me into British comedy and genuinely changed my life. I still have the episodes I torrented back in like 2005. Unbelievable loss. Rip
There are really funny comedians then there is Sean Locke! RIP funny guy. I hope you can buy your tinned puffin hearts from Lidl in the sky.
That man's got me through some of the toughest shit in my lifetime. It's a hard loss to take, and I'm just glad that he went in the best possible way, and that would be surrounded by family, not cancer, like someone might believe because of the lack of context given.  Goodbye, Sean... We'll all miss you
Always the people you least expect to pass away, then when they do you realise how much you loved them when they was here
Gutted he's gone ..... one if thr funniest men to ever grace my TV screen
He made me happy. I'll miss him.
F
Have been watching old clips for the last 24 hours and laughing till I cried at times. What comic genius. What a loss. Rest in peace, Sean
Thank you Sean Lock for all the laughters. Wherever you are, I hope that you finally will beat Diego Maradona. Because that top prize belongs to you.
Absolute legend.
Just another comment paying respect to the man, the legend, the comedian and the entertainer that was the wonderful human being named Sean Lock.
I am currently at the edinburgh Fringe watching comedians. There won't be any with his timing and delivery. Absolute legend,
"I'm more like a sensation or an idea" -Sean Lock  Yes. Yes you were, my good man. A sensation we won't experience again for a long time.  Rest in Peace Mister Lock. Rest in Peace
still can't believe he's gone. he made me laugh so many times growing up & even until now.  RIP to this man. fucks sake
Comedy God 🙏
I saw this video come up a couple of times and thought naah that must be a joke. Guess I didn't wanna think about it being real. Damn. Rest in peace Sean. Your jokes made my life so much better at times that I needed to laugh. I'll be watching your jokes till I'm dead. Cheers
What??? No 😔 another one taken to early.
it's funny how you can miss someone that didn't even know you.... More than a comedic genius , he was a happy man R.I.P Mr. Lock
legend
Fair thee well oh travel or time and space.  You go to prepare for our eventual demise. Keep it funny
Sean lock was the first comedian that i actually found genuinely funny without feeling like it was scripted. What an immense loss to the comedic scene. An absolutely legend. Rest in complete paradise Sean ❤️🤴
This man was DANGEROUS (I just nearly had a heart attack).  Loved you, Sean. Thanks for making my world a happier place.
He can't be gone 😭
it feels surreal that he has passed away…
Rest in peace to the comedy legend Sean Lock <3
I'm gonna miss this man, so much
Just watched Sean... laughing out loud- then I noticed my eyes are wet.. Another great comedian lost way too soon....
We will miss you Sean. You were fucking funny. 🖤
Loved him . Such a great comedic talent.. cant be matched .
countdown wont be the same without sean gone but never forgotten rip
Man, this is going to be the most challenging wank of all :(
the judges throwing up behind me line had me choking near to death
Watching Sean really got me through the past few years, my heart goes out to everyone close to him, such a loss. He will be missed RIP
R.I.P bigger then life
Beautiful man , your legacy will live on x
What an amazing man! Whenever I feel down I always stick on a compilation of him and it never fails to lift my spirits… he will be sorely missed, RIP Sean.
On Q.I - “So, Stephen! What are you pissing through these days?” 🤣
So sad , such a loss to humanity thank you for All you done for us making us laugh and enabling us to forget our troubles with your hilarious humour rest in peace 🙏💖 💫
Rest in peace you legend
If you downvoted this video you are a tosser and everyone knows it
Without a doubt, one of the very best comedians. Rest in peace Sean 😢
I was hoping the title was a mistake like a video for a different comedian was but it's not and the world's a bit duller now. Sean Lock was so funny and without even trying. Rest in Peace.
Absolute legend never laughed at any other comedian as much as Sean. RIP
❤️ comedy has taken a big loss losing Sean lock and so has comedy fans . R.I.P
One of the funniest people on the planet. :(
My late brother was very much like Sean in humour. Both now sadly gone and both sadly missed.
Absolute legend ❤️rest up
I read tweets yesterday. the one from Piers Morgan made me cry with laughter, he wrote a quote from Sean lock- 'when I die I want to be cremated and rubbed in Piers Morgans eyes'
0:35 "It'd be like hot tarmac & a vet's flannel." Legendary. RIP
What did you want to be when you grew up Sean? ‘A fanny magnet.’ - you will be missed Sean, thanks for the laughs, you were the best.
he vanished from 8 of 10 cats does countdown a few years back, and I thought it was odd because he was good. Then he returned and his voice was different, seemed to have lost weight, seemed to be subdued from his usual or FULL self. I figured maybe he'd been seriously ill but was back because he beat it. Its sad to hear of his passing now. Very funny man. RIP
Rip Mr lock thanks for the many laughs...
Damn, that's actual sad as
i am so sorry for Sean and his family, i was not even aware that he was sick....he is simply put a genius....RIP
He always made me laugh
One of the greats in British comedy! He will be missed! Rest in peace Sean😭
In all these years, Jimmy never laughed harder for any guest than he did for Sean on a regular day
Legend! Rest in peace.
May all time favourite was 'That's a challenging wank"
I still can't believe he's gone. He'll be missed. Thank you for the laughs, Sean ❤
From across the pond, so sorry to hear about Sean passing.  Love watching YouTube videos of 8 out of 10 cats and enjoying every time he was on!!!
Damn shame. Great humour, great wit, and will be sorely missed in an increasingly humourless world.
thank you for the laughs, R.I.P
Showing off his rectum to St Peter ❤️
I will miss him. Got to know him through QI. Sincerest condoleances from Belgium.
Got me in tears... Rest in peace world champion of carrot in the box You will be missed

Damn, brought me so much joy. RIP to one of the funniest people ever!

"All the energy of a rat, trapped in a can" "Imagine that.."
Sean you will be missed.  Top comedian tell it how it is. I still can't believe it. You've left a great mark in the comedic world and life itself I believe ❤❤
A true comedic genius, even when he was unwell he still provided us with so much entertainment and laughs.   "You can't write tears Jimmy"   Thanks so much for the tears of laughter Sean, you made the world a funnier place, and you'll be remembered among the greats.
A true legend
Such a sad loss. He was excruciatingly funny, and a comic genius.
It's so watery i'd say cheers 🍻 😥

Rip Sean Lock   the master of the challenging wank
I had no clue he was sick. Was this known? My heart goes out to his family.
R.I.P. to a truly funny man.  Heaven is a much funnier place now.
Genuinely upset, great comedian

What an amazing talent. RIP. X

R.I.P 🙌
8 out of 10 cats does countdown will not be same without you Sean. Rest Easy buddy. We miss you
❤️💔
He had such a unique and rich sense of humour that nobody else on the show could ever replicate, which explains why he always had people howling. Rest in peace Sean
RIP man, Sean was one of.. if not THE best British comedian yet so underrated too, he went so soon. Always a great laugh when watching Sean
never heard of him, been watching him all night on old clips,to be honest i never heard anything remotely funny or amusing? guess not to my liking, rip
Oh CRAP we all love Sean.. sorry to hear this Great Comic mind has gone too soon .  15 stories high will always be one of my favourite shows ... blue rat!
Devastated by the news of Sean’s passing - a great loss indeed 😢
There’s good comedians & then there’s genius comedians. The ones who make it look easy. That’s a unique gift. Sean had it in abundance that’s why we all feel his passing acutely. Best wishes to his family. 😢
Described as a comedians comedian RIp❤️
Poor Claudia just couldn't cope. RIP
What an absolute legend 😇😇
Am more like a sensation an idea hahaha
Rest in peace Sean. You will be missed 😢
Who tf disliked
An unbelievable loss </3
Such a talented funny man! And from what I can see, adored by his peers.  RIP Sean, your seat on these shows will be very visibly empty.
Rachel had such a great relationship with him❤️ Seanie special ❤️😂🥲🥲🥲
Very sad heart ❤️ he was so hilarious and just brilliant. “Challenging wank” always 😂
💕 The best. He was addictive.
You probably had a small group of friends, but hundreds of millions of us out here thought you were our funny friend who kept us laughing. Thanks for the laughs.
I'm crying laughing at the saddest news ever THE funniest man ever
Nobody will come close to sean! RIP 🙏
I'm so saddened by Sean's passing 😥  Rip sean 💗
British humor   Spaced out So no one gets an overload of one- liners and puns
The best. Love you Sean x
thankyou for all the laughs you genius
Never met the guy but I feel like I've lost a friend...he's made me literally cry with laughter so so many times...my thoughts are  with his family at this time...its always the good ones  that leave us too soon. You will be forever ever missed...my friend.
*R.I.P SEAN LOCK*
How in the world is the “That’s a challenging wank!” Not in his remembrance/highlights?? Literally his best moment on the entire show
"Hot tarmac in a vet's flannel" How the *hell* did he come up with such original stuff, no one else has thought of? Genius.
he gets 5 minutes? jeez
RIP Sean you will be greatly missed 😞
283 dislikes ? Wow, just wow 😳
Rest in peace and thank you for the laughter ❤️
It’s hits different knowing he was battling cancer through all of this without saying, rip legend
Had the pleasure of seeing Sean on stage in Cardiff a while back, he was absolutely brilliant. He will have them in stitches wherever he is. Bless you Sean for all you have done.
Such a great comic. Not many make you feel like you knew them, but Sean was just so genuine and funny. This is a big loss. Thanks for all the laughs Sean.
RIP to such a great talent, very funny comedian Sean Lock
Amazing mind. Rest in peace
RIP Sean. You'll always be remembered. Thank you for all the joy you brought us.
"If I could have my ashes spread anywhere I wanted, I'd have them spread in Piers Morgan's eyes."
Rectum of the year. Claudia gets it. It's hilarious.
Rip Sean lock so sad to hear you passed away you was sooo funny 😔 xx
I used to watch 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown for his cynical remarks. And he was pretty grumpy on QI. Will (Australia)
I have no words... Too early for such a genius to pass... All that remains is what he was best at - making people laugh. You will be missed...
Rip Sean lock. Absolute legend of British comedy
Nothing says it more than that his fellow comedians are creasing themselves.  Not many professional comedians find other comedians funny because they can see where the joke is going.  He’s something else though.
Rip. But in all honesty he wasn't that funny.
💕❤
One of the greatest voices in comedy. Sean, you will be missed.
Honestly haven’t cared so much about a celebrity passing away. Gutted I never got to see him when I had the chance! One of the best by far. Rest in peace ❤️
Anyone remeber the 'lemonade, milk, lemonade, milk, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate-choreography to a Madonna performance? That number made med laugh my teeth out. Sean Lock you made us happy.
Nooooooooooo!  Whyyyyyyyyyyy?  Nooooooooooo!  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  It’s what he asked for x
What a shame
Sean Lock brought so much joy to my life when I were in my deepest darkest times. Whenever I felt down, I always watched his stuff and he made me laugh and I could forget all the crap that was going on. When I heard he had passed, I felt like someone from my family had passed. I was waiting for new post pandemic 8oo10cdc episodes.  They will have a grand time in Heaven with Sean around.  RIP Sean Lock.
Soo sad to know that we will no longer be able to enjoy his jokes on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown.Even here in Australia he will be missed by many. RIP Sean. Keep them laughing
Very sad to hear the news of Sean's passing, a rare comedian who you never grew tired of watching.  You made a nation laugh Sean, not many can say that . The champion of carrot in a box, RIP Sean,you'll be dearly missed by those who know you and those of us who just felt like we did.
🌺🌺🌺
A great loss indeed. Absurd comedy at its finest. One of the very best. You will be sorely missed Sean!
What an absolute brilliant comedian. Such a teriible loss
Sean defined British comedy. His unique style was something we’ll perhaps never come across again to this level. RIP mate thank you for the laughs
Goodbye mate. Thanks for the laughs.
Too many amazing bits, moments and interactions to even list. So many. So much laughter. Carrot in a box, Sean and Johnny Vegas playing off eachother, Sean taking the piss out of Jimmy Carr........yup. I'm ugly crying today.
It’s just not fair! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 So Much Love for all his Family, Friends, Colleagues and Fans 💕
To everyone who has missed 15 Storeys High — please do yourself a favour and watch it. It's genius.
So sad
An absolute legend, so unexpected and so sad RIP Sean Lock
Dude no. 😥 RIP
The one man I thought who couldn’t go
Thankfully channel 4 gave this epic comedian the air time. Please don't go the way of all the other's and bring us all more lefty shit.
Sucha  funny guy. "Dont know about you, but Im still ion the fence." Love it :-)
I didn't see this coming :'( We've lost a legend.
Shocked to hear the news. R.i.p sean What a legend
The bite-sized hourglass sequentially mate because male subjectively clap above a left kidney. black, romantic option
Sean Lock invented Liquid Death, send his estate those royalties immediately
rip brother gone but mabye forgotten
DAMNIT.  ALWAYS the good ones.  ALWAYS.  I'm gutted.  Sean is timeless, just simply timeless.  Love to you and yours.
What an absolute legend.  Seemed like one of the nicest guys out there and was bloody funny. RIP Sean.

Sean Lock was the best reason to watch this  Always original, always damn funny and will be sorely missed  R.I.P Sean
Well done Sean well done 😔😢
Vale, Sean Lock. Thank you for your gift of priceless comedy beyond compare.
This man was a national gem and will be dearly missed!
This video had me in tears with laughter then with sorrow, what a lost to comedy
Sean said  When he died he would like his body to be fly tipped , he liked the thought of annoying people after his death 😂  Legend
Laughing while simultaneously bein sad at the same time watching this 😶
"I won't spit on you when we're having sex tonight" followed by "...that's a nice thing!"
Such a sad loss for the the comic world. Such a huge fan of Sean lock and he will be missed. May he r.i.p
At the top of his voice “CAN I BORROW YOUR LIGHTER YOU   STUPID PRICK” had me in stitches. R.l.P Sean Lock
RIP COMEDY LEGEND.
Bless u Sean lock. You made us laugh 😂
comedy and carrot in a box genius condolensces to friends and family ❤
0:15 a dictionary don’t have enough words to describe the whole worlds feeling after such devastating news… lost a great legend.. a great comedian… such a simple calm guy and just so naturally funny… RIP Sean, your jokes will live on forever ❤️❤️
Gutted 😢RIP Sean
Oh so funny. This clip made my day. Best wishes to friends and family and RIP Sean. You legend 😂🤣😢
I think I’ve got your plough. Goodnight sir. Thanks a million ❤️
Why would you ever dislike this?
Absolutely loved him. I’m celebrating his life with love. I think the universe needed him back. Bless you my friend 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️😀😀😀😀
The comedian's comedian. The greatest compliment. I saw him live at the BBC and he told 50 puns in 20 minutes,  incredible retention. Every one made everyone laugh.
What a man. Absolutely gutted he’s gone. He leaves us with a wealth of material which we can all laugh at forever more. A personal favourite of mine was the trophy he had for the ‘worlds greatest shoplifter’. He didn’t win it of course. 😂. Genius. RIP.
8 out of 10 cays won’t be the same without him.  Prayers to his family.
loved you humour ... RIP
Rest in piece Sean you were a inspiration to me and many others. The most important thing you did was to able us all to laugh hysterically, you will never be forgotten. All the best to you're family.
A comedian genius
I’m in absolute shock i’ve only just found out. My misses basically said she didn’t want to tell me yesterday because Sean was my favourite comedian and she thought i’d take it better if I found out organically. Well… i’m crying a river Justin Timberlake style 😢
A comedy genius. A comedian other comedians loved to watch.
Oh my days, the most naturally funniest man. So so sad to hear of your passing, but your legacy live on and will make people laugh for years to come RIP Sean
I shed a tear yesterday morning, and welled up a little this morning. Didn't realise how much he meant to me. Didn't know where to post this because i don't have social media. So i posted it here. Gonna miss you Mr Lock
Gutted to hear...... Man's a legend
Such a comedic genius. He will sorely be missed
Probably the only time of hearing of a celebrity dying that actually shook me, I'm gutted, he was brilliant.
An incredibly gifted spontaneous man.  You ALWAYS made me laugh.  I hope your personal life gave you the joy that you gave to us.
This show will never be the same without Sean Lock.
Comic genius
Funny guy 😂😣😂always remember the laughter xxx
So sad couldn't believe the news, one of the few comedians that I could watch over and over again..
So sad he passed away now he's makin the angels laugh
RIP Sean ... but I never knew Trevor was on here
Heaven just got a little funnier.  Sean Lock, Robin Williams Thatcher, and Churchill are putting together a barbershop quartet as we speak.
This isn't funny.
🤍💔🤍
The seal clubbing bit was a personal favourite.  Hope whelks are not on the menu in heaven. RIP Sean, the undefeated carrot in a box champion.
Got me through some brutal and blunt times 🤣
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Gutted my favourite shame he can’t see how many people liked him
Such a funny man It’s wank he’s gone
No Covid Passports
He brought everyone so much happiness
A decade or so ago when my ex and I were homeless in London he never once walked past without showing love and putting an extra fiver in our pockets to make sure we could eat! Never forget kind gentures like that once you're back on your feet in life, u remember the times u struggled most and a man with such character stops, sees you, shows you kindness, empathy, care still exists and from the kindness of this "stranger" i would never forget. I will always feel blessed to be touched by his, seen with his kind eyes and how huge an impact he made on the millions of people who adore him. Will be so sorely missed
Oh mate, Thanks Sean ; you came here and did what you signed up to do; to Bring joy laughter, shenanigans and merriment to an otherwise rather drab world . You’ll be missed. Condolences to his family and those who knew him best . 🙏🏻
Bastard. That's another pint I won't get back...
He was so good, clips like these put a smile on my face at the worst of times , RIP Sean and condolences to his family
I didn’t know Sean had passed. What a great comedian and will sadly be missed by millions of fans. Condolences to the family and much respect from Kiwi’s around the globe. R I P.
2 MILLION plus views in a day, shows how well loved he was.Thanks for the humour that has kept me going watching so many re-runs over the past 18 months
Guess this is what happens when you reanimate the Nazis and putting them on a tropical island for a realty show
funniest man i‘ve ever witnessed. you will be missed sean 💔
I didn't even know he was sick. I'm absolutely gutted. I feel like I lost a close friend even though we'd never met. RIP you were a comic genius 😢💔
I am truly devastated, we lost a great legend. Rest in peace Sean.
such a great man, rest in piece
RIP Sean, your appearances will be making people laugh for generations.
RIP🕊🕊
Ok
Rectum of the year ,had me in tears of laughter. R.i.p sean
I remember one time when Joe on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown was reading his poem about naming willys, Sean could hardly breathe from laughing so much! To see him like that just floored me laughing Awesome guy
Honestly couldnt choose a fave bit of him to come here and comment about... he was a great comedian. Lost too early.
I am destroyed...my deepest sympathies to the Channel 4 family and everyone touched by this marvelous wit, from a cousin across the waves in the States
Carrot in a box will forever hold a place in my heart. Genius 🥕
God bless ya Sean, loved ya. Rest easy.
I never used to be able to sleep unless I had does countdown on as background noise. Even in the hardest times, Sean never failed to make me laugh, this show was my comfort. I didn’t think celebrity deaths could affect me until I heard of Sean’s. In many ways, he saved my life. RIP Sean, you have no idea how much joy you brought and how many lives you touched, just by being yourself
Absolutely gutted
RIP Sean, your comic genius is pure magic. I dont think you ever realised your greatness and that's what makes you  and your work special.  Just seen Bill Baileys tribute to you and the love he had for you as a mate is astounding. My condolences to your family.
WHY DO THE BEST GO SO YOUNG .  Go make heaven laugh . A very very very funny human being . RIP SEAN
Sean an absolute legend. Huge fan from here in Finland. May he rest in peace, hugely missed.
Gone too soon. Rest well, Sean 😔🙏🏻❤️
Oh man, just found out 😔 RIP Sean you funny legend ❤️🇬🇧✌️🥲
I’m so sad, R I P Sean Lock you’ll be missed a lot❤️
Such a funny warm human. Rest in peace Sean.
To be able to make so many people laugh, including other comedians who are also at the top of their game is the most amazing talent. Definitely feeling this one but thinking more of his family and friends. 8 out of 10 Cats and the Countdown spin off just won't be the same.
what a funny man and a nice guy god bless from peter liverpool
so sad hearing the news yesterday, he had so many more years of entertainment and happiness to give at only 58 years old.. we'll always have the hours of laughs online to look back on,  RIP one of the funniest in the business
RIP Sean.
A lot of famous comedians make me laugh but no one made me belly laugh like Sean Lock. Such a fucking shame man. Probably *the* most naturally funny comedian there was.
Super bummed
No matter what this man said he never failed to make me roll around laughing, I'm really going to miss you Sean RIP
RIP Shaun, you made my cry through laughter, now I cry through sadness and loss. You'll always be undefeated in "carrot in a box"
Awww definitely gone waaaaaay too soon . Rip so so sad 😭
Genuinely the only time a celebrity death has really effected me. Loved this man. RIP.
Rest in Peace Sean. A fantastic comedian and one of the most enjoyable people on TV.
'I beat Fern Cotton'   Best comedian I've watched live!
R.I.P.
In a world where there is always so much to bring tears to your eyes, this man brought tears of laughter. You made the world a much better place, which is all that can be asked of anyone. Thank you Sean.
So sad that Sean is no longer with us. My favorite moment was when he told Miles Jupp that he wouldn't spit on him when they made love later. Such a unique man who will be really missed.  RIP Sean.
Just watched about 4 sean best bits as he was one of my favourite comedians,All as funny as the last, laughing away at the same time feeling actual pain and sadness for someone I'd never met...big love to all his family and thanks for all the smiles and laughter you gave us,RIP🥺
Honestly hurts ma heart watching dis... What a legend Sean. Love n miss u!
Rip to the reigning Rectum of the Year and carrot in a box champion
RIP 🙏🏽
Not bloody fair. Sean Lock was just wonderful, rest in peace buddy
This man was a legend RIP ❤️
Funny my arse!
Feel like ther should be more
Rip you absolute legend . ❤
RIP.
Sad loss.  Thank God there are hours and hours of YouTube videos showing this man's comedic genius.
RIP sean <3
I have cried tears of laughter with him watching his career and now I cry tears of sadness knowing he’s no longer here. Gutted for his family. One of the funniest men in history. RIP
I haven't been this devastated since Rik Mayall died, what a loss to us all. 💔💔💔
Has to be one of, if not the funniest man that I have seen or heard. God bless you, Sean you made me laugh so much x
Bloody hell! People like Sean leave us and absolute tossers remain far beyond their expiry date or wished for expiration by me at least, only there to taunt us mercilessly with an incredible ugliness and rudeness that does nothing but cheapen our lives. Damn it Sean, come back. You honestly made me laugh.
Rest in Peace sean. Thanks for the laughs
Absolute comedic legend
True legend, very sad news
It’s an incredible gift to leave a body of work that will keep us all laughing long after he’s gone. I hope he knew how loved and admired he was. An amazing talent, it’s very sad 💙
RIP Sean, ill miss you mate.
good bye legend
What an absolute legend he was. Hilarious! Beamrules was absolute genius.
❤
Making other comedians cry🤣
So sad such a great guy and personality ...RIP
Truly he was a sensation an idea. He will never be forgotten. RIP Sean Lock Comedy Genius 🙏
I hope you'll come home to the fullest mousetraps in heaven! Rest in peace!
Man, this news is so friggin' sad. He was a true master. One of the very best. Sorely missed :-(
Been a fan for years rip mate one of the only reasons I turned on the telly
Just like that, the world becomes a little less funny. Rest in peace to one of the greatest there ever was and ever will be.
A great loss, my condolences to his friends and family. Fantastic comedian always found him hilarious no matter what I watched him on.
Rip sean lock. Great comedian
That just sucks. The whole damn thing.  What a legacy though. This man will make people's sides ache with laughter for generations. Most of the rest of us leave behind a shoddy carving in a tree and a few worthless comments on youtube.
Humour is a personal thing, so I felt that he was a weirdo and unfunny but RIP.
Lol..
A true comedy genius!  His random off-the-wall comments were the magical formula for 8 out of 10 cats and a show which will never be the same. Taken far too soon.  RIP Sean
❤️❤️❤️
Painfully funny man - such a shame. Lung cancer and smoking ? Sounds like it from his voice and cough towards the end - but anywsys..... just so funny
Sean Lock Live is one of my all-time favourite stand up shows, and he was consistently one of the best things about Cats does Countdown. Taken from us so young :( RIP
Don't like comedians but he always made me laugh
What an absolute legend.
He broke all the beamrules of traditional comedy and was so uniquely hilarious. What an inspiration, thanks for all the belly laughs ♥️
RIP legend
Wow 2M views and counting
rip Sean Lock. One of my all time favourite comedians. He will be missed greatly, particularly when im binging watching 8 out of 10 cats for the thousandth time
I don't think I've ever cried sad tears while laughing. Lots of love for Sean's family and friends from the US! He will definitely be missed!
Was in shock when I heard of his passing yesterday gone too soon! Just a natural talent was funny without even trying to be. Rest in peace and I'm sure wherever you are your continuing making others laugh prayers with him and his family ❤
“Beamrules”, “challenging wank”, carrot in a box, live from the Apollo… What a legend, and my favorite company during sleepless nights. Very sad indeed to learn about his passing. Thank you so much from Sweden, Sean!
2 million views in 2 days... a tribute indeed. RIP mate, Youtube, Netflix and more will keep your gift alive.
it was a shock
F
I miss this man so much 🥺🙏🏻❤️✨
So crazy this man won’t have another birthday or Christmas or Father’s Day, RIP to a funny man and a very good soul may you rest well up there GOD BLESS
The fact that he claimed to have embezzled money from the RNLI, knowing what I now know, makes me think that he was even more of a fuckin legend!
RIP 😞
That's a challenging w@nk 🤣🤣🤣🤣 will be truly missed x
I have never in my life cried over a famous person. Always thought people who did were pathetic and ridiculous. I’m now crying because Sean Lock gave me hours and hours of true laughter. SUCH a brilliant, unique, quick witted genius of a comedian. I’m going to miss him and his really weird, original humour. Can’t imagine what his family must be going through.
LOVE Sean Lock, so sad about jis passing. His humour was ten to none, he will be missed!
Nearly cried when I heard the news. Absolutely hilarious comedian, his humour was the best.
What a fucking loss to the world
Thank you Sean   RIP
An absolute treasure. Thanks for all the laughs Sean.
I have had depression since i was a kid.... 45 now and no joke when I heard he had gone.... I felt my stomach drop like fuck.... i have often just fell asleep listening to sean but also many others.... i honestly have come close in the past 30 years or so to leaving this place and strangely i give enourmous thanks to all comedians for the laughs and just for the moments of distraction through the years.... if there is an ultimate being... well it now has one of the best.
Damn this news got me in tears, my favourite comedian. Rest in peace and my thoughts are with everyone who was close to him.
Seemed like a nice bloke, sorry to hear of anyone dying before their time.
Rest in peace Sean
Nnnnoooooo!!!!!! Comedy lost a great!
“Coming home to a full mouse trap….. *ahhh* “  Gets me every time.
I sobbed when I heard this very sad news. Sean was the reason I watched 8 out 10 Cats does Countdown. He was so funny and I will miss him big time. My thoughts are with his family xx
He will be a big miss. Very funny and witty man RIP.
Rip
One of the best ever. Rest easy 💔
What a Legend . 🙏
RIP
RIP Sean. You made me laugh!
So hard to comment, just want to thank him for all the laughs. He will always be one of the best. His family should be so proud of him. All my thoughts are with them.
A massive loss... RiP
An absolute gift from God! Says a lot when a person will be missed by so many people who didn’t even know him! May he Rest In Peace. Heaven has gained an EXTREMELY funny man!!!
Such an amazing comedian. Sad to hear the news of his passing.

I was such a massive fan of yours and I thought it was only me that got your jokes..... But it turns out everyone did.....and amazingly you touched not only my heart but millions of others world wide.... Lots of love to your family and keep making your quirky jokes in heaven.... R.I.P.......the RIDDLER  ? LOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂
A true comedy great.
One of Britains finest. He will be missed.
This is some sad shit
An actual legend, gone too soon. Thanks for the laughs, Rest in Peace Sean Lock
Sean, may not be with us anymore,  but the laughs and smiles he gave us will last until the end of time. Thank you Sean Lock for being a bloody legend
RIP
Nazi island… absolute hero, sad times.
What a legend. Basically the sole reason I started watching UK panel shows was seeing his pitch of Nazi Island as I was searching for something WW2 related.
Runner-up rectum of the year, two times carrot in a box champion. May your mousetraps in heaven always be bountiful and may your ashes be scattered in Piers Morgan's eyes. We lost a real gem of a comedian. RIP
What a legend, a massive loss to comedy, heart felt condolences to his family and friends.
I'll never forget the infamous carrot in a box.  Always made me laugh the hardest, miss his laugh
Really gonna miss Sean's humour such a great guy in many ways, but thankfully we have all these great clips to remember him Rest In Peace Sean I hope your cracking them up wherever you are....
I have always admired this wonderful man. His mind was genius, a 'Comedians comedian' with super sharp wit. If you find it is pouring down outside, it is not rain but this man making the angels cry with laughter! A beautiful soul. RIP Sean!
The most surreal and hilarious comedian ever. RIP, a legend lost.
To have a joke about your rectum being your epitaph. Only legends could achieve such a fate.
Funny guy
Awesome comedian the guy was hilarious. R.I.P
just hope he wasn't one of them..
He's one of my favorites. I will miss him. RIP Sean Lock
One of the funniest innovative comedians of our time we have been blessed to have   Thank you Sean. Bless you x

Wow,just looked at this and could not believe this news,lost my lovely wife karen to cancer,and that horrible disease took karen away from us in weeks,my heart goes out to him and his family, nobody knows how mentally tough grief is to deal with when you are so much in love with your partner, 29years and one son and four lovely girls in the time we had together, karen passed away peacefully on June 10th 2021,I guess God wanted his angel back,and she was an angel,karen loved kids and became an excellent nurse to special needs children,God opened up the path to heaven for you, My beautiful lady,who would bend over backwards to help others, love you so much karen and miss you more and more each day. Love you babe.💔👱🌟LOVE YOU SO MUCH DARLING KAREN.R.I.P.             R.I.P. SEAN AND LET HIS LOVING FAMILY GREIVE NOW.

RIP Legend. Genius of comedy and will be missed by all 🙏
Damn we needed him longer
:/
I wonder if he'll get the send off he once said he wanted: wrapped up in a bit of old carpet and fly-tipped on a hedge in an area of outstanding natural beauty, just so he can ''annoy people even when I'm dead'.
Thank you, Sean.  Many a night through the past 18 months of 'lockdown', you made me chuckle and end the day laughing.  Your wit will be remembered.
Wait, he was a year younger than my dad? Now that hits even harder.
This is just the worst, RIP you legend
Genuinely gutted, Sean is a comedy genius. Deepest sympathy to all of his friends and family but may your memories of him bring you laughter and joy xxx
I think its finally time. Please make a compilation of each and every one of Sean Locks moments from the show. The world was shit before, but now it became a lot shittier.
... the planet , just got darker.
Kept finding myself watching Sean Lock's stuff when i was at the lowest points in my life times when i really needed something to put a smile on my face  He never let me down
Loved him. His Beamrules gag was genius.
what a wonderful guy, I think that as the family member he felt like to everyone who watched him, he won't ever really be gone. he'll be there, every time we think back and smile.
Loved Sean’s sense of humour and saddened to hear he’s passed away.  Rest in peace fella...
A fabulous man.
I dare you to say the name Sean Lock and not smile. RIP Sean.
Best comedian of this generation. my favourite. RIP.
I’m actually shocked. He was funny
love u sean
Now that's a challenging wank
RIP Sean Lock My favourite moment of his is during the big fat quiz with James corden when he told everyone that the kids Christmas performance was pretty shit it just made me laugh so much RIP you legend you will be missed
Very sad a great comedian 😢R.I.P SL ❤💯
So many laughs from Sean.. Thank you sir, you were a legend at your profession.... R.I.P.
R.I.P.  Sean .😭
A legend. Rest in peace Sean.
Rip
Rest In Peace
R.I.P Sean.. So Sad To See You Leave us..!!  We all love you ..x
Honestly I am in shock. Rest in peace sean
RIP Sean gone too soon 😢x
"Coming home to a full mouse trap" A joke and a punchline all in one. Goodbye Sean, you odd geezer.
R.I.P Found him through youtube years ago, always enjoyed his personality and humor.
Fucking legend.
Well  That's one way to find out
Will be sadly missed.
Legend , Nothing more to say . RIP Sean
Thanks for the memories. RIP
I knew something was wrong when he lost his voice for a year :(  RIP Sean Lock. One of UK's funniest comedians.
Breaks my heart every day, Sean will be missed dearly for many years to come. His comedic intelligence wasn’t matched by anyone else’s. Rest in paradise.
😂🤣😢🕊️
'challenging wank', 'rectum of the year' and 'seal clubbing' - all in one episode, - unbelievable talent- rest easy genius .
no. I only watched 9 out of 10 cats does Countdown with my mum a few times and he was hilarious and now I find out this news :( RIP
He was one very funny man 😭
My dad died of cancer last year, me and him both loved Sean. His passing has really hit home. While I was grieving my dad watching 8/10 cats was a little break for me where I'd forget for a few minutes. RIP Sean you absolute legend of comedy! You had the formula of joke telling and wit very few will ever achieve x
Rip
No!!
Worth noting that he found out he had cancer in his youth due to a one night stand. He's had it for most of his life which is surprising really!
o7
i thought this was a joke. wtf?
R.I .P. a great loss to the human race, but my heart goes out to his family.
Every time I listened to him I would have tears of laughter  running down my cheeks. ...  Too many 'funnies' to mention. R.I.P. Sean.... 'That's a challenging wank.!'
Still cant believe this, R.I.P Sean you are a legend!
Devastating funny and no one made other panellists laugh like Sean. Rest in peace
He reminds me of my uncle so much, now I'll never here the quick wit again
Sean's comedy helped me through a very difficult time in my life. Thank for all the laughter you absolute legend. Rest in Peace.
What a man
Wasn’t aware Sean was no more. A sad news for all fans of British comedy.
Thank you for the laughs in horrible times Mr. Lock. Sleep well
Seeing that endcard is so upsetting. So jovial and likeable, it's hard to believe he's gone.
A legend, gone far too soon
A genuine one off - a true comedy original. Sean’s passing is such a loss . RIP Mr Lock. Never to be forgotten x
Sean
Whats gone on in all 250 of your minds to have left a dislike on this video, shameful.
Rip Sean Lock you will be missed 🌹💐🌷
The physical soldier rarely grip because nose conceptually harm amid a workable intestine. jumpy, cynical north
Rest easy legend
One of the few people who made me laugh so much I cried. RIP
Sean lock got me through terrible times, I used to stay up watching 8 out of 10 cats and Sean never failed to make me laugh despite feeling like the whole world was against me. He’s a true British hero. May he rest in peace.
RIP Mate. Sleep well
Nooooooooooo whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy nooooooooooo aahhhhhhhhhh
Last one with Claudia and jimmy in tears is my absolute favourite, I think Sean also proudly tailed about seal clubbing there. RIP Legend.
Rest easy Sean. 💙
Heaven just welcomed a genius. Thank you for all the laughter.
Had me laughing over ten years ... Dam shame... 😢
8 out of 10 Cats become my fav show ever, 90% due to Sean Lock. Amazing comedian. Rest in Peace 😭
Rest in peace Sean. No doubt  you are now running across a beach full of baby seals with a hammer  in each hand. You made me laugh .Thanks
The carrot in the box trick with John was just pure genius! Sean made me laugh at some tough times. RIP Sean
"There is a vegetarian option: You can fuck off." 🤣🤣🤣 RIP Sean.
Absolutely legend , r.i.p .
Really upset I loved him in TV heaven TV hell
RIP Sean Lock, you will always be one of my favourite comedians
I’ll just pretend he is still here. It’s easier that way. Bless you x
I think the time that Sean Lock had me laughing more than ever was the carrot in a box segment on 8 out of 10 cats. Just a legendary moment in TV.
Who TF is down voting this video?!?
Dam, still shocked..just knew him as TV personality...
Thank you Sean Lock
Brilliantly absurd, absurdly brilliant, witty, irreverent, sarcastic... there are countless adjectives to describe how funny Sean Lock was. Was.... I hate using that term with people I admire. As an American lover of British comedy, he was one of my favorites. I put him up there with the likes of Python, Atkinson, Douglas Adams. I have no other words. Now I'm going to binge watch all things Sean Lock for awhile.
Can't believe it. He was my favourite British comedian. His quick wit was always a joy. He will be missed.
Shopping in Lidl... "i've no idea, it could be butter or mastic"     All of Sean's apparent throwaway quips and one liners were carefully hewn and developed over years. He was a fully time-served comedy craftsman RIP
WTF I'm shocked 😭😭
When Sean and miles are together that duo is to funny when they talk about hitler makes me die laughing every time. Rip Sean
An absolute god amongst men!
I’ve shown my soft side twice; Once to my wife The other time, I slowed down for a horse  Sean Lock, you will be sorely missed  edit: MY FAVOURITE JOKE OF HIS! I DIDN’T THINK IT WOULD BE INCLUDED
Yesterday was one of those days where I kept finding myself starting into space and thinking about him. Huge condolences to all his family and friends. I'm sure there is a big hole right now and they are in my thoughts. RIP Sean, legend.
No disrespect to any other celebrity that passed.. But a world where Sean Lock doesn't exist is actually upsetting to me..
😓
Beamrules ! ....................F*****G brilliant !   RIP Sean.
Such a unique and clever comedian. He became a favourite of mine after watching him for the first time. Nothing more I can say that others already haven't.
What a legend
Rip, legend
Absolute legend
Merger  Deep programing shos  And they did experiment on us by this method we did it to ourselves in the end what makes you think your children need a manmade needle to live on this planet
RIP Sean, undefeated Carrot in a Box champion...you bloody legend!
I’m more of an idea lol ! Great comedian so funny & witty will be missed. Tried to see him live a few times but couldn’t get tickets. RIP Sean lock
I think the tiger who came for a pint being published would be a great tribute. Legend of a man gone to soon..
I almost crashed my car once, because I was laughing so hard.  If it wasn't for my mate (who was also laughing his knackers off) yelling at me to stop, we would have gone over the road down a hill and injured. Sean was one of those comedians who could make people laugh just by looking at them and saying "what". Most of my favourite comedians have died and there's not many left. Bill Hicks was one of my Fav, Sean was too. RIP and deepest condolences to his friends and family.
Sean Lock, what a guy! And what joy and laughter he brought to us. The world is a little bit grayer and duller now, with him gone.
Thanks for all the laughs over the years Sean you are one of a kind RIP 😭
Rip Sean lock. Thank you for all the laughs! God bless Sean and his family ✌️
So heartbroken. RIP you splendid “sensation”‘ of a human!
Heartbreaking news... What a legend. One of the best to ever do it. Rest in utter peace Sean. See you on the other side.
A man whos made me cry many times over with laughter. One last cry, Sean. One last cry. Rest easy. <3
It's a real shane, such a talented and unique comedian.
I discovered you on QI and never looked back. RIP Mr Lock. The world certainly is duller without you.
Rest in Piece Sean. Absolute fucking legend! We’re all going to miss you mate.
Having a quick wit is a gift that can't be taught and Sean Lock had it in abundance, very sharp, very funny and my type of humour R.I.P
One of the best  dry witty comedians of the past 15 years R.I.P matey thoughts and prayers with ur friends and family
Rest in peace Sean. So sad to see such an awesome comedian pass away before reaching his golden years.
Now he's up there, terrorising angels in heaven. RIP Sean
Rest in peace Sean. So many enjoyable times laughing to your jokes
Always thought he was on the mark, cheers from the United States and Rest In Peace to Mr. Sean Lock.
Such a shame - a great talent taken too young.  RIP
The melted gladiolus delightfully injure because kendo surgically scrape around a yielding block. cultured, elated route
Gutted
Cried SOOO MANY times listening to this brilliantly funny man! Thankyou Sean RIP 🕉🙏
You will live forever in our tears and smiles .. will miss your brilliant yet effortless humour Sean!
Great comic, such a shock! Thanks for the laughs. R.I.P xx
Comment 11 I am EVERYWHERE 🙃 find my other 10 comments for a free snickers bar
RIP Sean, I would have loved to have seen N@zi Island become a reality.
Was is public knowledge that he had cancer? The news of his passing came as a shock!
The Man's comedy gave me so much joy! R.I.P. Mr Lock. It's hard to imagine a world without you (:-( Xx
I usually dont get that emotional when people i dont know die but this one really got me. Im so grateful for all the laughs and he will be remembered.
Taken from us too early, what a tragedy. His memory will live on through these videos and make us laugh and cry even harder. Thank you for being my source of laughter in the darkest of times.
Im gutted,and crying,a great talented comedian,gone way,way too soon,RIP sean,my thoughts are with your family and friends ❤️❤️❤️
Never thought he'd make cry,and it wouldn't be because of laughing so hard..R.I.P
Legend
Thanks Sean!
The undefeated carrot in a box champion
What a large loss…for the world. Made laughter, smiles and no hate.
Who downvotes a memorial video? There is a joke there somewhere I'm sure he would have found.
I will and we will miss you  humour like no other. Rip Sean
4:44 I can't stop laughing
this tribute should have been an hour long...
His wit was unique and at times very funny. RIP Sean Lock . Another talent lost far too soon.💐
Such a sad loss. RIP Sean. You were unique and incredibly funny. Now you will cheer up all those people up in heaven.
RIP Sean, I worked comedy for two years and its INSANE graft that you made look like anyone could do. Genius, timing, madness, literally the comedians comedian. 💔❤💔❤
Just epic, thanks for all the laughter
Rest in peace, you will be missed, thoughts to the family 😥
This was so unexpected. RIP Sean! 😢 The other panel shows never caught my interest for long but I kept watching this one and it was mostly due to Sean! What a legend!
A true legend of comedy. Don’t think anything will top ‘Carrot in a Box’ for me. RIP.
i would be sad but i'm giggling too much remembering the time miles jupp's mascot was just a picture of Sean that's "been in the family for years" and it just completely made him break down
This video could have been hours long and still not fully displayed his wonderful humour. Shame not to see Carrot in a Box or him promising not to spit on Miles Jupp...
I'll miss you Sean. You brightened up so many dark days. Rest in peace.
R.I.P
I will deeply miss the intelligent & inane humour of Sean Lock from down here in Australia !   My thoughts are with his family at this sad time, but they should know his humour will live on and bring joy & laughter for generations to come.  God Bless you Sean.
My friend, you will be sorely missed. Sleep well.
disgrace how this videos been disliked
From 4:40 you can see the effect cancer was having on him
Glue Sean Lock
I hope he got his wish to have his body fly tipped on a country road.
Does anybody else remember him rocking the Walter white look for a while. I think he was telling us in his own way   RIP Sean
I can't believe I had to find out like this... Rest well big guy
I can't believe he's died. One of my favourite comedians. RIP Sean Lock.
So sorry for Sean’s death. Lovely and funny man. He will be missed.
he doesnt even try to be funny. it just comes out like its nothing. R.I.P always put a smile on my face and had me laughing more than i thought i could
One of the greatest to ever do it, completely effortless in his delivery and always had me in stitches.
RIP 😭
RIP
The CCPvirus and lockdowns made me so depressed I’m crying over the memories of how this legend made me laugh in the past.. before masks and social distancing and other things imported from WuHan
Another proper comedian down.. Very sad..
“Coming home to a full mouse trap” had me howling on the train.
We shall never see the likes of him again. Funny, funny, funny. Bless to his wife and children.
There is only one time in my 66 years that I've felt this sad at the death of a comedian.  Eric Morecambe 1984.............That's how high Sean rates .  RIP  Sean.
RIP Legend
Shocked just shocked. My condolences to all his family and friends, fans and everyone that knew and loved him. A very funny man and very sad loss indeed. RIP Sean Lock
"I beat Fearne Cotton" is such an underrated line.It's that what turned it into gold.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible)    "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him "go and sin no more"-Jesus
I absolutely love that he can't keep a straight face at his own jokes.  Rest In Peace, legend.
RIP
RIP you funny comic😢😢😢
Will be missed
So sorry to see him go, legend.
Imagine if the last thing he recorded that was broadcast was that part about resurrecting the leaders of the nazi party for his tv-show "Nazi Island".
Rest in peace
Fantastic comedian and a loss to us all.  Rest in peace Sean.
R.I.P Legend that is Sean lock
What a loss, such an intelligent and amazing witty man who delivered genuine laughs and every home in this country.
Claudia's reaction to "Rectum of the Year" RIP Sean.
I can't believe he's gone RIP Sean Lock I'm going to miss him
such a naturally funny man, real loss to the world and we are all going to miss him
Rip Sean from Auckland New Zealand
Never knew who the guy was  and all.i.see his him
A true British comedy great from his generation or any generation. When I think of Sean, I think Ridiculous, a sense of the... (R); Improv (I) and Personality, unique. RIP Sean, you were great. Thanks.
Rest in peace, always.
Yet another legend gone, this ones for you Sean, rest in piece you legend.
Watching Sean Lock (and Jimmy Carr) really helped me when my dad started to decline quickly with dementia (to his eventual death). I had no one to turn too as it was just dad and myself. Those two were key to me getting through that tough time.
F
I’m so sad to hear this news. I had no idea he passed. Rip.
“Set the sprinklers off”. Just when you thought his joke come anecdote couldn’t get any funnier he drops this line in. An amazing comedians comedian. I was genuinely very sad when I heard this news yesterday. Heart felt condolences to his family and friends.
I have never been so gutted in my life... this man was a king of comedy and Ill miss him dearly😔
NOOOOOOO WHHHYYYY NOOOOOOO AHHHHHHHHH
Local hero in Chertsey my home town. Never had a chance to meet the man but my father saw some of his early performances. Devastated to hear of his passing. That rectum of the year bit is not only hilarious but also a perfect example of ramping up absurdity during a routine. A bloody legend.
Countdown cats will never be the same again.
I’m genuinely gonna fucking miss this geezer
Rest in peace big man Mad bastard <3
What an absolute legend. I can’t think of a more unique comedian, you never knew what was going to come out of his mouth and that’s what made him so special. Rest in peace Sean
“Carrot in a box?” Will always be one of my all time favorite bits
This man has had me crying with laughter literally   crying with laughter ..
Just found out Sean passed away today... Last year when the lockdowns started rolling in because of covid, I got a random clip recommended to me being Sean's funniest bits in 8oo10cdc. His banter with Miles and the whole not spitting on him during sex instantly made me a fan of his. It's because of this that I've come to know and love British panel shows especially when he's in it. Rest easy now Mr Lock. You'll undoubtedly be missed.
My two favourite Sean Lock lines are  "...but you do get stressed...like the other day, I was killing a pig with a hammer...." and the second isn't a joke so much as a simple life-fact "Well, my dad always told me to never drink in a pub with a flat roof"
We will miss you so much. Thank you.
Ohhhhhhhh.....  If you wanna get a tapeworm eat some pork!
Brilliant comic. I’m gonna really miss him not being on Cats Does Countdown.
His humour was effortless and almost ad-lib like, others who try this just aren’t funny, sad loss for all those who like to smile and have a giggle. RIP Sean
Thank you so very much Sean for all the laughter.
Sean's gone. That's a challenging wank.
It would be hard to choose my favourite Sean joke, he delivered so many that floored me. RIP Sean.
Masterpiece of a comedian and human. RIP
Thanks for all the laughs Sean! Absolute legend!
Not only was he talented and funny - he also acted like a 'real man'. Something lost in today's society.  He battled cancer and didn't make a big deal out of it on social media.   He kept his dignity and honour. Similar to Chadwick Boseman.   Prayers are with his family and friends.
Big love from down under. There are very few places in the world where he didnt make people happy.
My favourite comedian since quite a few years.... a genius who always made me laugh...sometimes until tears came out of my eyes...a bit like now but I'm not laughing this time. RIP, you will be remembered for a very long time.
"They ran my obituary underneath the alpaca story Jimmy. A fucking alPACA..."
Undefeated Carrot in a Box World Champ right there. RIP
Sad that he’s gone but lots of great memories and tears of laughter that he has given me and my wife over the years . Truely one of the great comedians of our times . RIP Sean .
THE CARROT IN A BOX!!!! WHERE????
I just found out about this!? And I'm binge watching 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown! Owh gosh, the next few episodes will just makes me cry...
Thank You for all the jokes Sean
Sean was the main reason I watched 8 out of 10 cats. An absolute legend will be sadly missed.
Only 5 minutes?
Eternal life granted onto him and may perpetual light shine upon him!
His jokes were so good, halfway through this video I forgot that he passed away. Rest in Peace.
rip good man
You know when a comedian is Great because your laughing and they are laughing and the punchline hasn't been delivered that's True Comedy Genius!
RIP Sean one of my favourite comedians
Forever will be the Banana In A Box Champion
Will truly be missed as one of Britain’s great comedians. Shame we will never get a part 3 of carrot in the box… absolute genius that gave us so many laughs.
Absolute Legend.
Me crying with laughter is how Sean wouldn't have wanted it.
Rip
RIP to a true legend
Across the pond... Wasn't aware of his battle. Loved his sense of humor and all these comedy panel shows. Will be missed even from afar. RIP
Amazing comedian. One of the greats
Im American, a few years back I stumbled across some clips from 8 out of 10 cats. I was drawn in so quickly by the humor, the wit, and the fellowship of the show. Eventually I started surfing all the clips I could of all the guests. Sean Lock was the most prolific comedian out there. His timing and delivery and mood selection was second to none. I honestly felt empty yesterday when I read about his death. RIP to a legend.
Rest in peace, bringing fun from England all the way to Costa Rica
This news genuinly made me sad. The genious and 2 time Carrot in a Box winner.. RIP you brilliant man! Now I will once again see Wilkinsons penisnamingpoem and watch Good old Sean crack up completely...
One of the best comedians! RIP 🙏🚀
I have tears of laughter and tears of sadness. I will truly miss the brightness and joy you brought to my living room.
The only person besides family that i have felt bad about when they passed, see you in the next one Sean!
RIP mate, the nazi leaders on an island joke is as funny as anything ive ever heard, thanks for the laughs ❤️🍺🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
So so sad. Incredible talent. Such a funny man and equally as silly. My kind of humour. The only comedian to make me laugh so hard it hurt. He will be deeply missed 😢 Condolences to his family, friends, colleagues and fans.
Very sad news. He's the only comic I've seen live repeatedly, when he visited our city. He is a legend RIP. Thoughts go to his family!!!
A very funny man. R.I.P. Sean.
I am here in the USA and only recently discovered him. He was funny as hell. May he rest in peace...
Sean really was a master of his art, so unbelievably funny. Such a sad loss. RIP
I will be forever grateful to Sean for all the happiness he has blessed us with
RIP Sean..N0:1 trending and so it should be.. beating rappers showing off cash.. intelligence/humour always wins over selfish shallow self-centred importance
Bugger man. I was just looking up some of your humour and great insights to cheer me up this morning.  Found you have beaten me to death. You win. Just like you did in life ya bugger.
RIP Sean, my love and condolences to your buddies at C4 and loved one’s, whom will all be feeling the loss of such a wonderful and naturally funny, soul.   Give them hell up there and fly high, heaven has gained an angel 👼 xx
What a great loss
He set my sprinklers off with laughter on numerous occasions, and even in death he still will. RIP.
Funniest man on the planet. RIP. You’ll be missed
Honestly can't stop laughing at the part about beamrules. He will be missed by many people. RIP sean
Only ever time I’ve cried when a celebrity has died
Legend.
Such a funny guy! You will be missed!
RIP Sean you were the best
An absolute brilliant comedian, his whit and random statements just crack me up everytime. He will be sorely missed. Legend.
When I read the title I thought "ohh no.." and I Googled... my heart sank...   Such a big loss for comedy...  Rest in piece
You don't realize how good someone actually is until they're gone RIP.
NOOOOOOO! WHYYYYYYYY! AHHHHHHHHH!
It’s so weird to be crying and laughing at the same time. 💔
The best ever QI was always Bill Bailey and of course Sean . Brilliant.
One of the best!!!
I’m gonna miss him <3 he was an absolute genius and one of the funniest men! RIP Sean Lock
R I P
“You can’t write tears, Jimmy.”  Sean was absolutely right. Rest In Peace.
To hell with that cancer RIP Sean I have no words
“Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo”
Sean is a damn epitome of British dry humor. Love this guy. A goddamn legend forever!
his mascots on each weeks was like a stand-alone tv series. will miss him
Noooooooooooooo! Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! Noooooooooooooo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
Such a sad lost he was on another level of comic genius.  He won’t want us to feel sad though he’ll probably say cheer up you bloody tossers!! Rip Sean you made us happy and laugh till we cried.
Made it look so effortless. Amazing
I feel this is the best way to remember him,  he always wanted to bring people laughter, so thats how he’d want to be remembered  RIP😔
I've been watching Sean since my pop has its been so many years when I seen his tribute I thought it would be a funny lil clip of his like many others I've seen now I'm in total wreck no more laughs to come but we can look back on the lock and have a giggle or two mate, love you be safe up there rip
R.I.P 😢
legend no doubt
May he rest in peace, brought some good laughter to me
RIP Sean Lock, he was a legend who made me roar with laughter, he will be sadly missed
I can't believe he's gone. He'll be missed.❤️
Can of water
Sean Locke has always been the greatest comedian. One of the few who could make me laugh hysterically. I loved watching his bits and they got me through so many tough times
He was so naturally funny
Such bullshit he's gone, he had so much more to give, whether it be laughter for us fans or love for his friends and family.
Carrot in a box game !!
I have never mourned the death of a celebrity - I've been sad, but I can't mourn for someone I've never met and didn't truly know.  Sean is different.  For those familiar with his comedy, he made the world a better, brighter place, even on his darkest journeys into the absurd.  He had a quality about him that made it seem like if you bumped into him in the street he'd gladly stop and chat.  On three separate occasions, Sean almost caused me to die in the manner second on my list of the ways I'd want to die: laughing so hard a blood vessel in my brain pops.  News of his death brought me the same pain I felt in January this year when my aunt passed, though that pain is mitigated by videos like this.  While they exist, and people still laugh, he will never truly be gone.
Sean was a gift. Rest in peace.
What a legend. RIP
RIP to one of the funniest man in the world
He was fantastic, a great loss.
Rachel a freak
Never commented on a YouTube video before, but this one I just have to, I'm absolutely gutted, R.I.P. Mr Lock, thankyou for making our lives a little more joyous everyday....memories that will never be forgotten.
The man went and nobody even knew he had cancer
Never take this video down. What a legend. Rest in Peace.
'Nothing worse than kids fucking trying to act.' RIP, Sean. You were a LEGEND.
Rip
Now he´s finding carrots in heaven :(
Sean wouldn't want us upset, he be laughing up there in heaven  saying "haha   silly twats"
Legend, will be sadly missed by many. Thoughts and prayers with your family. God bless and rest in peace.
RIP shaun
Rest in peace one off the funniest guys I've ever watched
Very sad to hear he is gone. Very lovely man and fantastic comedian
Amazing comedian, so quick and clever! Rest in peace. Xxx
I laughed, then cried, and laughed again. RIP Sean, a truly talented comedian.
RIP Sean :( Loved this guy so much
This should be much much longer. A legend sadly gone. RIP to one of the best comedians of the modern age.
How can you thumb down this? Really! Are you that cold and heartless? RIP Sean. I hope you are making them laugh their tits off up there!
Well i haven't laughed like that in a while. Proper crylaughing.
R.I.P Sean...........one of the very few humans that could have me crying with laughter.....he is and will be missed....God Bless.
Devastated hearing the news. Couldn’t care what show was on, if Sean featured then it would be take precedent before anything else. I’ve never seen a comedian with such quick wit. Some of the outrageous things this man came up with on the spot will live on in my memory forever. God bless you Sean ❤️
Prince’s passing was an ‘Oh bugger’ kind of moment and I was quite shocked when James Gandolfini and Bernie Mac died but Hearing of Sean’s passing has genuinely moved me.  I will be less sad when certain members of my family die.
Thanks for the laughters
Absolute legend.
How could anyone dislike this video??
Rest in Comedy bro. Your comedy was truly unique.
Im so sad , ive heard him almost my whole life . wow
RIP to the carrot in a box King
What a comedian 👏  sad day
I'm going to miss his voice so much
Dude wtf I had no idea he had died before that 5 second outro, that was heavy. He was one of my favourite comics. I dunno how to feel.
The world became a lot less funnier yesterday. RIP, one of the funniest men to ever live.
Amazing comedian - sad day
this.. was not the way i wanted to find out about this
RIP to the two-time champion of carrot in a box. He will be missed
5 mins? This should be 5 hours long minimum.  The guy's a genius, RIP
A truly talented comedian! Never failed to make me laugh. Will be sorely missed. RIP
RIP Sean, you were the only comedian who could always cheer me up however I was feeling. Sleep well.
His reaction to Joe Wilkinson's penis naming poem always made me smile. Watching someone in utter hysterics is always worthwhile. RIP Sean. Gone way too soon.
I am so sad. What a loss, what a big loss. I was introduced to him last year and became obsessed with his comedy
huge loss and taken far to early, rip Sean, love to your family
❤️
what devastating news :( rip
The legend that was carrot in a box. RIP Sean, you will be missed.
Sean's delivery seemed so effortless, which is a rare find with comedians these days.  A true legend that will be sorely missed.  RIP, sir.
He will be truly missed- unpretentious and a genuinely funny guy. RIP
Legend.
Absolute legend!! Rest in peace
wtf he died
Absolute goat 🐐
Who tf would dislike this
If I find any of the 200 people that disliked this video they’re getting clapped
his complete joyful confidence in whatever he was saying no matter had mad it sounded, always a crack-up.
The one where he says to Rachael Riley when she’s wearing a Viking hat “that’s a tricky w**k” 😂
Ive always been puzzled of how he is so naturally funny. Rip
I was surprised at the level of sadness I felt when I heard the news. Normally I don’t fuss too much over “celebrities” or famous people when they pass. This one caught me by surprise. R.I.P. Sean Lock.
Had no idea he was sick. Feels like losing someone you know so well. Uniquely British. Bit like Rik Mayall being gone - we miss these guys.
Had no idea he was sick. Countdown won’t be the same without him.
I think he had me on QI. "I hear voices." "Do you?" "Yeah... But I ignore them and I keep killing."
Legend.
What humorless philistines put a thumbs down to this? Piss yourselves laughing with Sean, imagine a few pints down the local with a guy like that who cheers everyone up, priceless
Shocked to hear the news about Sean. Such a great comedian and so many happy memories of watching him do his thing at stand up gigs and on the TV. Cheers Sean , RIP!
I thought it was just a tribute because he was funny and now I’m heartbroken
What a legend. I'm going to miss his dry sordid humour. RIP Sean
We love you Sean, comedy genius, RIP. X
Started watching 8/10 cats does countdown a year ago to work out the numbers & letters with my family and to get a laugh from the comedians, the show won’t be the same without Sean.
RIP
Brilliantly funny man
What an absolute loss of a legend. Rest in peace mate.
What hits me hardest with losing Sean is that I honestly won't be able to watch 8 out 10 cats does countdown anymore without shedding a tear. This man always had me laughing ever if I heard the joke 1000 times. Never in my wildest dreams could I create a joke half as funny as this great man did. Rest in peace Sean, you were a comedic genius and an around great bloke
Can’t believe they did a 5 min video to remember him. There’s random compilations that are longer
Legend
R. I. P. Sean Lock, one of the funniest comedian's in the world.
They say a lot of comedy is in the delivery, and Sean always had that absolutely nailed with such ease. An amazing comic, he's gonna be missed.
Watching this man got me through some tough times, he would always make me laugh, RIP Sean
Truly the master of panel show hilarity. Condolences to all who knew him, family, friends, fans.
Rest in peace Sean.
8 out of ten cats moments please
You know what. I’ve only just realised I’ve never heard a proper intimate interview with Sean lock. He was always ‘on’, and feel it would have been good to know of his life beyond the face of comedy!
That can of 'water' sent me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 RIP you absolute legend ❤️
Well..i dont do this stuff, write comments such as these - but this has gutted me and im sure many others - Sean brought a lot of joy & laughter, an incredibly quick unfiltered wit and far too young to go
Many years of incredible jokes miss him already. Rest In Peace Sean may you forever be screaming at pigeons from now on.
The world is a little bit less fun today
So many people will miss Sean. R.I.P.
A legacy that won't be soon forgotten. The all time greatest carrot in a box player. Rip you absolute gem of a person
Everytime Sean spoke on that show you just knew comedy gold was on it's way.I actually found myself excited waiting to hear where he was going to end up with the madness he had started lol.Honestly the man was a genius..if there was anyone more naturally funny than this guy on tv then I haven't seen them.What a tragic loss.
Thank you for the laughter sir. Too sad.
Such an underrated comedian.  Gbnf
I’ve seen him in so many videos, plenty of which i watched over and over again. Even when he just wasn’t in his usual panels, I missed him. Even living across the world and only every knowing him through videos, I’m genuinely sad he’s gone. I’ll just keep missing him. Very grateful for what he gave while he was here. RIP
Laughing through tears watching this. Can’t begin to count the amount of hours Sean’s made me feel less lonely whilst at uni or eating dinner or just sat in my room. Brilliant talent and massive loss
Noooooooo! Whyyyyyyyy! Rest in piece to a legend
I really want his tiger goes for a pint childrens book, channel 4 do it for charity.
Fucking legend.
Sean, an absolute legend. He will be sorely missed.
What a loss, may he rest in peace
Will be so missed
RIP Sean you will be missed, all the best to the family on your loss
What a comedian, what a man.  RIP.
Sean needn't be grateful to comedy, comedy should be grateful for Sean Lock. We are many millions that when we find our selves at a low point and think of one of Sean Lock's best jokes will feel better about the world. Inspired. Elevated. Happier. For the rest of our lives. Now, that's a legacy. RIP Sir and thank you for the music.
The last part hit hard :(
Brian and Margaret 🤣🤣🤣
Damn watched a few Countdown YT compilations a week ago, and people where mentioning in the comments (and id noticed as well watching episodes on TV here the last few years) about how his voice changed and how he looked etc over the last few years and everyone was saying hope its nothing bad... guess it was something to be concerned with after all (granted i had no info about him outside of the show and a few others id seen him in).  Cats does Countdown, wont be the same without him.
R.I.P Sean you will be missed
Still cant believe he is really gone.
I’ve grown up with Sean Lock and his humour. He was a staple in British comedy and to know that he’s no longer here feels too surreal. Shows like this are going to feel like something’s missing from now on, as he was one of a kind. You’ll be greatly missed, Sean, thank you for all the laughs! ❤️💔😢
My dad bought me a Sean Lock DVD when I was about 14, his humour was right up my dads street. He reminds me of my dad in a lot of ways, very clever, very dry, witty sense of humour, sort of seems to hate the world but at the same time is probably one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. We watched that DVD together all those years ago, and I remember we were both absolutely creased up laughing. I've been a big fan of his ever since. My partner and I often stick on some countdown clips if we wanna cheer up after a hard day, these clips are all brilliant but not even his best ones. He was just consistently so funny, so clever, such an excellent comic...really knew his craft. Had a little cry yesterday when I found out he had passed, had another little cry just now watching this. I've only ever cried at a celebrity dying once before in my life and that was when David Bowie died. I really held Sean in high esteem, and I am truly saddened that he's gone, and that the world will never hear more of his jokes. I hope he is at peace, and I wish his family all the best.
This is shocking.  Loved Sean on 8 out of 10.  Brilliantly funny man.  He will be missed.
Incredible comedic brain. One of my favourite comedians, definitely going to be missed.
One of the top comedians for sure. Hilarious lad shame to loose him :/ RIP
Wow I am gonna miss this man.
BRILLIANT!
a true comedy legend R.I.P
I'm truly devastated to hear this! He was a brilliant, funny soul. Can't believe he is gone. RIP Sean Lock!
Rest in peace legend!
absolutely gutted about Seans passing
RIP Sean u will be missed.
I refuse to admit his gone. Legend!
What a humour xx Enjoy your next part of the journey, you will be missed here greatly but i have no doubt you will be having them rolling where you are xxxx Don't rest in Peace, Rest in Laughter xxxxxxxx
i miss him so much, rest in peace sean, you were an amazing comedian and person. true legend x
Number 1 and 2 on trending, well done sean you deserve it RIP
.R.I.P.
Such a great comedian will be missed. Never a dull moment when he’s on tv :( miss you mate 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
From the US.  I watch Countdown religiously. Sean absolutely MADE the show.  I can not help but wonder how he would spin all the attention his passing is garnering.  I am so sadden by this, and offer my sincere condolences to his family. RIP Sean.
So very sad to he has passed on...I watched him mainly online from the States... He was hilarious! I will miss his wit and clever banter... Sending thoughts to his family, friends and many fans!
funny man
The dislikes are from Toblerone.
Well this is proof that some people will dislike absolutely anything.
To the 213 odd people that disliked this, shame on you.
I can’t believe he’s gone. Many a time I’ve laughed until I hurt because of Sean. My deepest sympathies to his family
I'm crying again now watching this
Absolute legend RIP Sean
I cried quite a lot yesterday
Shocked by this bad news. I loved to fall asleep listening to his jokes. Thank you for all the pleasure you’ve given me 🙏. RIP. 🇳🇱
is it me? Or is it that this year is getting worse and worse
Sean lock once said when I die rub my ashes in thatcher's eyes lol hahaha  He's in heaven  Maggie is in hell Sean won the after life
The Christmas card bit was amazing What a genius, what a loss Not gonna lie, binge-watching a lot of British panel show clips helped me brighten last year, and he was a big part of that
legend
Sean Lock comedy legend RIP amazing talent he had to make people laugh so hard
finally I have a chance to win rectum of the year
I willnmiss Sean Lock so much. He was incomparably funny and the world is a lesser place with out him. If one good thong can be got from this is a higher awareness of skin cancer. If you see a mole on your skin with a rough texture then go to your doctor - don't wait don't hope it will go away - just go to your doctor right away and say Sean Lock sent you.
RIP <3
I like the one where he's talking about doing his bit for the environment, then he visited America and "whats the fucking point" lol
Was literally watching his jokes hours before his death. So upset one of my favourite comedians and and around amazing person has left us. RIP sean and i send condolences to his family and friends xo
This is so sad... He was absolutely brilliant <3
RIP, mate. So many laughs. Irreplaceable.
It's such a shame, he was a great comic and will be hugely missed by all that knew him 😢
My girlfriend told me last night , made me feel so sad and brought a tear to my eye .... So sad .... I Love comedy and always found him hilarious . R.I.P and to his family , so sorry for your loss 🙏 x
What kind of 211 animals dislike this? R.I.P Sean, you made 8 out of 10 cats...nailed it every time. I for one will miss you dearly. x
God Rest In Peace you fucking legend
Definitely should of included this Christmas box with the carrot 🥕
Long live The Riddler
One of the greatest comics of all time. RIP Sean Lock

I put 8 out of 10 Cats on every night to listen to while falling asleep going to be a sad night tonight. RIP Sean Lock 🥺
"That's a challenging wank." 😥
R.I.P to a hilarious man
I wonder if he did scream in his obituary? Like he said, you can't write tears
Ive never met him but he made me laugh more times then i can begin to count. I'm also glad 8 out of 10 cats exist so his talents can be enjoyed. What a great comedian and my thoughts go out to his family.
He will be sorely missed i watched this program for his comedy. RIP sean
Watched What If.. last night with a beautiful comment from Disney paying tribute to Chadwick Bozeman, and now seen a a touching tribute to a man who has mad me laugh till I cried. Oh god my feels!!
hahaha tickle tickle tickle!😻❤️
So sad. I had no idea he was dealing with bloody cancer
Such a loss. Very clever and funny guy gone way too soon. Condolences to his family & friends.
Rip Sean. I'll truely miss you
Laughing and crying. Oh man. My favourite comedian. See you soon Sean, but not yet.
:c
Undefeated carrot in a box champ. Devasted to hear of his passing
God bless you Sean.xx
Genuinely gutted, the world is a little less fun without Sean in it.
Funniest man ever, not many others can bring tears to your eyes laughing, R. I. P.   Safe journey
What a sad and very underwhelming tribute to a great man , whoever put this together put more in to there last sh*t than this .
God bless you Sean RIP
Godbless this comedy legend i loved his dry and to the point sense of humour he will certainly be missed but never forgotten 🍻👍
This one hurts💔 Rest In Peace Sean Lock, a true comedy legend ❤️
He will be missed. Who else can tell children that they're sh*t at acting!? Genius
RIP you beautiful man.
rip sean 😢😢
Not many famous deaths cause me pain but losing Sean is both a loss to comedy and humanity we need more people like him 😢
only 6 min?
RIP
This hits different now 😢
I was genuinely heartbroken to hear he's passed- RIP to a real one
Thank you Sean, for all the laughs.
Oh shit, I had no idea. One of the funniest men in English history. Enjoy becoming worm food my man, we’ll miss you!
RIP.  You were such a great comedian.
"challenging wank" was the absolute pinnacle... First time I heard that was absolute tears.
And that is why his will be one of the greats.  One of my all time comedians.  Thanks for the laughs Sean. RIP
Sean Lock was the funniest man on TV. Everything he did was funny and he never had a dull moment. I'll remember him as a comedy legend, up there with the best the U.K has ever produced.
He's sharp, sarcastic, hilarious wit will never be matched.
Cancer is bullshite, and can fuk on off down the lane. Why do people who bring joy with their voice end up losing them? This sucks! My condolences to Sean Lock's family and friends. He was so funny, make your guts hurt funny.
That beamrules joke is pure genius.
I thought it was the bitcoin guy
RIP Sean
Hello
RIP, What a great comedy
A wonderful man, and rather a sudden loss. Struck me this is going to happen to David & Vicky Mitchell, Stephen Fry, and Richard Dawkins   :(
It's true what they say about Sean, he was a Comedian's comedian.. he never left a dry eye in the house, even with his piers. He had a natural talent for humour. His dry and sarcastic whit was a great dynamic with any of the panelists, but esp with John, Jimmy and I have to say Roisin too. 8 out of 10 Cats will never be the same again. You will be greatly missed. Heart felt condolences to his family and friends.
The first time I heard 'That's a challenging wank' I spat my tea across the room. Rest easy you legend.
rest in peace, and may your hilarious jokes live on
This video was the first I knew of Sean’s passing. I’m in shock. I’ve been weeping like I’ve lost a family member. Sean made me laugh a thousand times or more. Wicked and courageous sense of humour. One of a kind. I’m so very sad. Thank you Sean.
The dirty belt currently sparkle because stepmother etiologically bleach over a gorgeous turtle. subdued, madly softdrink
So sad. Rip SEAN. thanks for the wonderful laughs.
RIP Sean Lock 🎩 Love you man
Vale Sean Lock
Always so sad when somebody who brings so much laughter and joy passes. Sean Lock made the world a funnier place. I wonder if he will have ever known the countless people he helped through dark times. A huge loss to this country. Rest in peace Sean ❤️
"It's from a canal"
so sad ❤🎤🤣
🥕 📦  👼
nooooooooooo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah whhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyy nooooooooooooooo
Surprised you didn't put the Hitler Island gag in there.  One of his best moments imo.
Beautiful guy. Humour is amazing. Ktbffh wherever you are.
One of my all time favorites. He had so many absurd and amazing jokes where he just rambled on about something that was so obviously nonsense, but yeah, no end to it. Spine in a sack.
RIP Sean Lock you will be missed
His “challenging wank” comment had me in tears. RIP 😔
RIP you comedy legend 💔
A truly funny guy. RIP.
Does anyone know the type of cancer? I noticed his reduced breathing in more recent episodes.
Question is - will there be a carrot in his box? That round had me in stitches!!
rip sean ..so funny
A great loss. Rest In Peace.
Saw this video pop up after watching a lot of 8 out of 10 cats over the last few months. This is how I learned he passed away yesterday. Sean has quickly become one of my favourite comedians. Comedy's lost a legend. RIP.
Rest in Peace🕊
Sean Lock made me laugh when I didn't even think I could crack a smile. I wouldn't have made it out of some of my darkest periods without him, and I'm gutted he didn't have more time with his loved ones.  RIP Sean Lock. I'll think of you next time I look up cute in the dictionary.
Sad day.
Genius awesome so funny I for one will miss him thanks for making me smile and laugh until I cried         RIP funny man
Laughed so much at his humour, cried with tears with how he delivered the punch lines. Going to miss this comedy genius
A Woking Class hero
a top class act, hilarious with a super quick wit. R.I.P
Utterly brilliant, my favourite comedian, even made other comedians laugh. RIP Sean.
My absolute favourite is when he makes a bet with Miles Jupp, the prize being he won't spit on him during sex.
It must be funny when you get a genuine laugh from Jimmy Carr.
RIP Sean Lock 🙏🏾 You were amazing at what you did. Watching your countdown videos were a great joy.
The episode when Sean said Rachel (wearing a beard) was a challenging wank…. My god that was a ripper…🤣 I’ll miss Sean Locke greatly☹️.  Condolences to his family.
RIP
Shaun didn't have to try to be funny he was just a natural. You can see he even made himself laugh and couldn't keep his face straight.
A True Great
Such a sad thing to loose a great comedian way too soon. Miss you buddy..
Who the f*** are the people who gave this a thumbs-down? Very funny guy, and everyone says what a pleasure it was to know him. Cats Does Countdown will never be the same.
RIP you magnificent man
I refuse to believe in this reality, instead I create my own, where Sean Lock is still alive and kicking Jon's ass in Carrot in a Box.
Ohhh no damn, condolences to Sean’s family & friends. Only started watching Countdown at the start of this year & have almost watched every episode. Much aloha from NZ
One of the funniest faces to ever bless our screens. Rest in peace you absolute crease up
What a talent, what a loss.
Thanks for bringing so much levity into the world mr lock. You will be missed dearly
Rip legend
Amazing, absolute genius. RIP
RIP Sean ❤️
I actually loved this man, I was always disappointed when he wasn't on 8 out of 10 cats.
What a great man! RIP Sir.
RIP Sean, absolute genius and one of a kind, can't believe you're gone.
This is terrible. Going to miss watching Sean. He always cracked me up. RIP.
I'm so sad he's gone :(
RIP thanks for the laughs you legend.
What a loss. His humor was like a mix of Bob Newhart and Norm MacDonald. RIP.
Oh, Sean.
RIP a legend, I will miss you!
Saw him live,  a truly funny man. Another lost to cancer. Fuck cancer 🖕
Hilarious person, his comedy and jokes where so good. RIP Sean Lock
I still can't believe it honestly, he's left behind many fond memories of his work that I'm sure will be much more meaningful now whenever we decide to watch a clip of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown, or a segment from what of his stand ups. Rest in peace Sean, you've deserved it buddy.
Thanks for the laughs, Sean.  Quite a few have "gone too soon" in recent years, but taking him from us at just 58? Come on .... that's over the horizon of unfair.
Cant wait for him to come back as a delapitated pigeon
He’s dead?  Nooo
RIP
“Make him stop speaking” Claudia. That’s high praise for a comedian. Sean Lock will be greatly missed, with thanks from the US.
You were my favourite, Sean Lock. I’ll miss you❤️
Funniest person on the show
My favourite comedian, so heartbreaking. His poor family :(
RIP Sean, thanks for all the laughs x
Funny AF.
Devasting loss, one of the greatest comedy minds.
RIP Sean. I cried. Never knew he meant that much to me but I cant imagine how his friends, family and co workers feel. One of a kind.
A comedian who said something because he thought it was funny, and we laughed with him. Instead of making statements or dodging landmines, the new breed should take notes on this legend. He's now doing a Heavenly Tough Crowd with Patrice O'Neal, Don Rickles and Ronnie Barker.
Absolutely devastated for you and your  family I didn’t even know you was going through hard time rip Sean you legend 🙏🏼
Crying and crying with laughter at the same time. Thanks for the laughs Sean.
We will miss you Sean
Rip….
This made me happy and sad cry. RIP Sean, a truly great comedian.  And a top bloke.
I'm deeply saddened to hear of his passing. Sean was a truly brilliant comic, and his loss will be sorely felt. Vale Sean!
I didn't know him personally, but his comedy has brought me joy for many years.  He was an incredibly funny man - one of the best at his craft. I hope this gave him pride and satisfaction that he lived a good life.   He will be missed by many people, but left a lasting legacy in the comedy world.  I think that's about as much as anyone can hope to achieve when their time comes - to have made a positive impact on many people.
Rest in peace to the funniest man💙
What an individual
God broke the mold of Sean. Truly an original.  R.I.P.  You will be missed!
Horrible news 😢
His comedy was one of the things that got me through lock down. RIP Carrot in a box.
God bless his soul.
So sad. Love watching him torture Jimmy and Jon with his great wit and humour. A talent sadly gone too soon :’(
Legend
RIP you hilarious bastard! Sean regularly made me cry laughing and now I'm just crying.
8 out of 10 cats will never be the same without you. One of the greatest comedians of all time, your jokes always made a bad situation better. Rest in paradise sean, you will be greatly missed by all 😥
Sean <3
Devastated. RIP.
Damn! I have only just started to watch 8 out 10 Cats... Immediately fell in love with Sean! Rest in Peace! You would have roasted the crap out of Germany! You will be missed!
RIP Sean Lock. Thank you for making me laugh until I cry.
Thank you for being you
Proof that there is no God, all the cnuts in the world and he took this man. You will be missed.
Gut punch, for me, yesterday. Refreshed my Twitter feed, yesterday morninf and it came up, as breaking news. Took the fuckin wind out of me. I remember seeing him, when a new series of 8 Out of Ten Cats Does Countdown broadcast and he had a shaven head and a sort of beard. Shocked me a bit. Then, on a few episodes after, he had a hoarse voice. Read on Twitter, a director that worked on his last stand up tour that he was possibly afflicted in 2017. Kept it largely private. I admire that. No fuss. He didn't want it. Fuckin brilliant comedian. Nobody like him. The world is awash now with stand ups, panel shows, sitcoms. There's dedicated channels just for 'comedy'. Can't speak for other countries, but, in the UK, he was worth his weight in gold for what he brought to shows he was involved in. They style, the delivery, the creativity, that shock he sometimes brought. I liked him before, but, I remember seeing him on the Jonathan Ross Show, when it was massive and on BBC1. He told a tale about how he got skin cancer when he was 22-23. And he said something along the lines of "I used to work on building sites. So, you'd have your shirt off a lot of the time. And it's really difficult to ask an Irish foreman if he'd rub some Ambre Solaire on. 'Mick?! You wouldn't be a poppett, would you?'" He had an Irish parent, and I think he was that fine line between respectable working class and lower middle class. That tale, I'll always remember, as I'm from Irish parentage that were and some might say (due to my behavior), respectable working class/middle class. Loved him. I'm one of them people (36) that never really went along with the culture of my time. Grew up in the 90's in inner city London, when kids were either into the UK boybands or garage/happy house. Shite, to me. I was tryna get hold of vinyls to listen to the greats of rock n roll, soul, blues, country. All the comedy I was watching and still do, is stuff before I was born. I was of the the thinking, and still am to a point - "Nobody know can touch what's come before." He did. One of Britain's best. Nobody like him. Fuckin loved him. Always will.
RIP, he was a true legend and a national treasure.
F
Sad now. Will be missed.
Thank you Sean. R. I.P.
I hope he is buried with a carrot  You are a legend and youll be missed!
R.I.P ..what a loss,comedy genius.
Thank you… excuse me while I go find a clean hankie…
WAIT WTF ????? HE DIED????? fuck man..
My favourite ever Sean moment was when the Tiger went for a pint book reading
Whoever gave this the thumbs down are a bunch of pricks.
I had depression for years. I survived those darkest years by binge-watching and laughing at the absurd and outrageous things Sean has said. Rest in power, Sean. We will continue to cherish and celebrate you. And thank you for making me survive.
I will say a silent prayer for him the next time I see a fly tipped load .
a sold laugh, for those of us who loved his humour he will be remembered. Thank you for being a light on some of my darkest days.
Absolutely brilliant! What a funny funny man!!
my heart man 🙁
Rest In Peace Sean, and thanks for all the laughter
💔💔💔
Such a huge loss, RIP Sean
Got to know him 3 years ago when 8 out of 10 cats video found its ay in my recommendation. Enjoyed him thoroughly while having dinner and lunches in the hostel. What an absolute gem . Om shanti
Still can't get my head around the fact he's no Ionger with us , such a funny wonderful man R.I.P Sean x
You will be missed.  Thank you for all the laughs.
Amazin!!
Another 'Real comedian' gone from us but never forgotten. RIP.
Heaven is now a funnier place Rip to a comedy grate
Such a funny man. Have watched and re-watched Countdown during these lockdowns. Thanks for the joy, may you rest in peace 🙏
Just gobsmacked Genuinely saddened 💔 RIP sean
The female fertile segment internally paint because gondola anaerobically dream concerning a defiant cake. abject, staking sofa
A very sad day ...
This hit me pretty hard. His comedy was a welcome relief during some tough times. RIP.
Was absolutely gutted when I heard, couldn't stop thinking about him throughout the day and the amount of times he made me laugh out loud.
😢 R.I.P Mate! It's definitely a sadder world without you in it...
There will never be another Sean Lock.. RIP.
Sad day, he gave everything for his comedy. I 100% believe an autopsy would find the cause of death was the 100 welks he ate in one sitting.   RIP Sean
Noooooooo! Whyyyyyyyy! Noooooooo! Ahhhhhhhh!
What a huge loss. RIP
One of the best deliveries in comedy.
Bollocks. This is a sad day :-(
Man it's painful to laugh at this now. Glorious Comic.
RIP.  He’s brought so much joy to countless audiences. He will be greatly missed.
RIP hilarious & awesome Sean Lock
There are a lot of funny people in the world but only one Sean Lock.  A terrible loss.
RIP Sean. Thanks for the laughs and the tears. Never forgotten
Im in Australia and thought it was a joke.  Now that I realise that it's true, I'm so very sad. His humour and facial expressions made me laugh so much...I will miss him so much. RIP Sean.
I don't laugh at many things these day, but my god the times that I do are usually down to this man, going to miss any new stuff by him but what a back catalog he's left us with, cheers for the laughs mate🍻🍺
Legend
Man fuck this, life ain’t fair
Absolute legend!! Rip Sean, thanks so much for all the laughter 🐐
I love him so much
Such a shame, and what a bloke......... RIP buddy
It's quite a tribute when it's just your own jokes and everyone else enjoying them. What a talent
R.I.P Sean Lock. The Christmas card still makes me piss myself laughing along with all you comedy.
RIP Sean Lock. One of my favourire lines was "That's a challenging wank"
havent choked up at a celebrity death in a long time. keep having to dry my eyes ever since i heard the news. rest in peace sean we’ll never forget the laughs <3
I'm grateful to Sean for getting me through the rough patch I in my lifw. Although I didn't know him personally, his passing hit me as if he was a close friend. Thank you for all the laughs Sean.
So very funny and brilliant.
Wait what?! sean lock is dead?!  RIP!
❤❤❤
Too sad. A craftsman of comedy!
Rest in peace
I grew up with him, absolutely heartbroken about the news. First time I cried over a man 40 years older than me
Wow, I feel like a family member has passed. 😪
What an absolutely shocking loss. I'm absolutely speechless. Thoughts go out to his soul and his family.  I'll always remember the time he wanted to bring back the Nazis'
Love you, fly high, gone too soon 💙
So sorry to hear such sad news. My thoughts are with his family. What a funny man and that's what he wanted to be. Sad loss.
The world just got less funnier.  RIP Sean Lock.
the comedian's comedian
Usually I’m commenting on videos saying “so sad R.I.P” but I don’t really watch much of the actor/singer/comedian’s work and I move along with my life but this time with Sean I’m actually really sad,  I’ve been watching his comedy for years and sometimes for hours a day, I’m really going to miss this man 😢
Rip sean
You will be so so missed 😭😭😭
How very sad.  What a likeable & funny man we’ve lost
Another great comedy genius passed on to the great unknown!    We seem to be in the last few years losing so many rare amazing people of Media & Comedy.  So sad,   I wish to say to his family how much their loved one brightened our world with his genius of making us laugh so much.   He be missed as so many others have whom gone from our lies!    In these hard times we need more like Sean Lock to take our sadness away and make us laugh.   RIP Sean Lock you will be remembered
He was a funny guy. 'Nuff said.
Gonna really miss seeing Sean on 8 out of 10 cats. He’s one truly hilarious man. RIP Sean.
:( :( :( :(
RIP Sean 🙏🏼 you'll keep me laughing for years to come...❤️
I'm in shock I only just found out that Sean was gone.... I had no idea he was that ill, he will be sadly missed and his type of humor will be our loss .. R.I.P. SEAN, Australia will miss you very much.   :(
Really liked him.  Sympathies to his family.
*rest😥❤🙌*
One comedian I would have liked to have seen live in concert. Great tribute but where was the "challenging wank" scene! LMAO.

i already forgot who he was
Heartbroken, Watching Sean on Countdown helped me thhrough tough times. We will miss you, Sean.
Woah he's actually dead. Heavy
WTF
Jimmy Carr: If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? Sean Lock: Well, obviously the front.
RIP my favourite comedian of all time
That's shocking news😟
Please tell me it's one of his pranks. He can't be gone...
I hope Sean gets his wish to be fly-tipped in an area of outstanding natural beauty.
A genius like no other. Feeling really sad, but LMAO watching his old shows. He would have liked it, I think. RIP you funny, funny man.
And the world is a bit bleaker. The gratitude for the joy he brought remains. R.I.P Legend.
How sad.
I've been literally rewatching countdown funny moments till 4am and this morning I found this... Thanks for everything.
What a man, What a mind, What an impression! RIP
Shocked to hear of Sean's passing this morning.  He has brought me many tears of laughter in the short time I've seen his comedy.

Can't believe it,  shattered , Sean I watched your clips over and over , every time with tears in my eyes .. Nazi Island,  Classic..
There will never be a greater comedian
Well.  That just made me depressed.
Really took everyone by surprise or at least most people. One of the all time greatest and the greatest in my books. Rest in peace you treasure trove of comedy
Just a devastating loss. Crying my eyes out while laughing at all the memories.
What's the worst thing that can happen at a wedding?  Sean Lock: "The bride gets carried off by an Eagle"  Genuinely gutted to hear about this yesterday 😔
Thank you for all the laughter Sean you legend . Rest in peace 🙏
He was always the best in anything he was in, whether it was a tv quiz show, his wife, or a bake off.  R.I.P. you grumpy old man.
Coming home to a full mouse trap
I'm a little shocked to hear of Sean's passing. He was a fucking legend of a comedian. Rip. Your jokes and humour live on mate.
Hard to explain his brand of humour. Whatever it was, it landed every single time. RIP to one of the best to do it.
The comedian's comedian. Rest in peace Sean, it's hard to believe you're gone at only 58 years young
WHO DISLIKED THIS VIDEO!? WHO?? WHHOOOO?!?!? 😭
I'm very sad to read this news. The world is a little less bright now...
RIP Sean. You will always make us laugh fly high mate
Well that's annoying, who's compilations am I going to watch now? RIP mate

I forgor💀
What a man. Thanks for so many laughs Sean. Hope you're having a nice can of water in the sky.
Wow. I just now YT Sean Lock to have a bit of a laugh and have now found out he had passed away.  R.I.P Sean. my condolences to his family
Gutted they missed out the best part of his ‘greatest achievement’ …. When he went seal clubbing
Vale Sean Lock ! THANK YOU for ALL the laughs ! 😞😞😞

Such a sad loss! Rest in peace, Sean!
He made me laugh through so many difficult times in my life. May you rest in peace you beautiful soul. Thank you for the all joy and smiles you brought to me and many people like me.  Rip Sean lock
Of all of the people who you'd wished to pass, the best and top funny guy has to go this week. What a loss to comedy, and upsetting the snowflakes. RIP Sean
Sean is an actual comedic genius. How could you cut out the seal clubbing part though? That was the best bit!
He won me over with the Big Brother and Argos net joke years ago.  Fantastic comedian!
🖤🖤🖤
Damn. That's all. Just damn. 💔
This guy brightened my day so many times. Shattering news. RIP
I can't believe he's gone. I didn't even know he was ill. Rear of the Year has me in stitches like Claudia.
I had no idea, I was watching 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown tonight and at the end it had a memoriam for Sean. I went onto Safari to see what they were on about and it said Sean had passed. I just about burst into tears. RIP Sean Lock 😭😭
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I'll never get board of watching and laughing at Sean, so glad rectum of the year was amongst these clips, the first time I heard it I nearly crashed my car a was laughing so hard, Claudia could barely speak 💖🤣🤣
One of the funniest guys I've seen.  Only just seen the news after this RIP.
here in Aus. love watching this show every week night - always a bit bummed when he isn't on. Anyway noticed an in memorandum to Sean Lock at the end of tonight's episode and my heart sank. RIP Sean you transcended yourself with your incredible sense of humor.
Thank you Sean.R.I.P
RIP <3
💔💔💔💔💔

It's only fair that you had to go. We might not have had you for along as we wanted but everyone on the otherside get to enjoy your humour now

Tears of laughter running down my face...you'll be so missed, mate.
Rest in Peace, Sean Lock. Gone too soon. So many hilarious memories, he'll be missed!

RIP Sean. Thank you for all of the laughs!
I always looked forward to watching Sean on TV and have spent hours watching his best bits on here. Can’t believe I’m watching this now with both sadness and joy at the same time. Only Sean could do that. RIP amazing human being 🙏
Oh gosh what a huge loss!  It’s so incredible sad! 😢😢☹️☹️🥰

My god... Saddest day ever. RIP you legendary comedian. I never watch him and not stop laughing. Everything's amazing about him.
RIP childhood icon
Genuinely my favourite panel show comedian of all time. Him and James Acaster have had me in stitches on sooo many occasions. True Legend
RIP, RIG. Condolences to your family and friends.
God Bless
Of all the incredible comics this country has produced, Sean Lock is one of very few who truly pioneered his own unique brand of comedy.   His grumpy old man persona, ostensibly misanthropic, interlaced with a playful surrealism, induced such joyous laughter, because you knew warmth and kindness were in abundance, underpinning all of it.  RIP, we'll all miss you.
I didn’t know he was sick. I am shocked
RIP
RIP Sean. You've got me through a lot of tough times. You will be missed.
This is heartbreaking. Lucky for us your humour knew no bounds. You had the innate ability to make us laugh, even when some of us didn’t feel like laughing. You will be greatly missed. May your gentle “hilarious” soul rest in peace!  💔
you made me laugh, will miss the sick humor and funny lines.       RIP Sean.
Comedy legend. RIP Sean 🙏🙏
Miss him already. What an awesome human.
RIP Sean, thank you for the wonderful memories and endless laughs
Coming home to full mouse trap.  RIP Sean.
Love you Sean - you were the perfect mix of inappropriate and absurd. Funniest panel show guest ever. RIP
Cant believe I didn't realise he was dealing with it all this time. I always watch 8 out of 10 cats online to cheer me up wont be the same knowing he's gone.
What an absolute tragic loss. my thoughts go out to his friends and family... RIP Sean and thanks for the laughs!!!
Omg I can not believe it I love this guy, such a loss. Love and thoughts to all his family and all that knew him and will miss him greatly
RIP Sean, you made us laugh and cry. Thank you for Carrot-in-a-box.
The most amazing comedian who I've watched since I was a child. I cried with laughter so many times while watching Sean. My thoughts are with his family ❤
Loved the show, loved Sean! Such a shame, he will truly be missed. Rest In Peace.
Such a brilliant comedian, one of the best of our time. RIP you will be missed :'(
I've watched this multiple time every time that final rest in piece screen is awful
He was always dry, surely like my own two eyes, refrigerator.
I knew something was wrong after I heard his voice in the later episodes. Wished he was okay but sadly not. RIP to a funny man and I’m a sure a wonderful father
I saw this and thought it must be bad wording but nope. Damn
RIP Sean, thank you for making me laugh during my gloomy times.
Wouldn't be surprised if there's just a carrot in his coffin at his funeral. RIP Sean.
Always seemed a cracking lad, proper shocked to see this yesterday .  Live forever Mr lock ✌️
Man it sucks to hear he's no longer with us. Definitely loved his style of comedy. R.I.P 🕊🕊
RIP to a legend 💔💔
May he always be remembered as the undefeated champion of Carrot in a Box.
What a wonderful, genuinely hilarious man. RIP.
Is it bad that I still laughed at his jokes even in this video?
When Did Sean Die?????? No Way!!!!! . . . .   : 0 (
I’m just devastated. I love this guy. Not having him bounce off Jon Richardson anymore is a damn shame.
We all know that carrot in a box and his challenging wank should have been in there, but you can only fit so much of his brilliance in a remembering video.
RIP
Rest in peace Sean, you were an amazing comedian and your humour reached people all over the planet <3
One of the greatest panel show comedians. RIP Sean.
Dude is hilarious. He'll be missed. #1 ON TRENDING.
Rip Sean . Great comic , has made me cry laughing a few times not many have done that .

I don't usually get massively hit by celebrity deaths but because of the nature of panel shows and the overall rawness of good comedy, Sean Lock's death has had me paralyzed by grief all day. RIP
RIP

The World 🌍 needs laughter 😥
wait what the fuck. He died??
Too many funny bits but the burp he did trying to eat 100 Whelks is up there.
I am so very sad but cant's stop laughing at the same time. I loved his humor and wit and the way he delivered his punch lines . Rest in Peace Sean. From a fan in Macedonia.
It wasnt all that long ago i saw him live. Another great comedian gone but not forgotten. You will be missed sean and dont worry nobody will be able to fill your seat on 8 out of ten cats.
Thank you Sean for making my life full of laughter.  RIP
There should be a carrot in his coffin. RIP Sean
Horrible news
Larger than life, you will never be equaled, rest in peace ol mate.
RIP so much love and joy in one man sadly missed ,thoughts go out to his family and friends.
Such. sad time. Sean was a genius. Easily the funniest on the circuit and there are some very funny people out there. I can watch reruns over and over and still laugh out loud on my own. "That's a challenging wank" I laugh just thinking about that one. R.I.P.
really 5 fucking minutes thats all he was worth to you fucking pathetic
A master at his work, always gained attention when he spoke, always loved his work, always will, your gift to the world of comedy and beyond. Rest well.
Man was an absolute legend
I wasn't ready for this sad, sad news and it hurts like hell. He has all the carrots now and forever. Rest in peace you beautiful bastard.
What a legend of a comic.
Countdown is all I had known him from unfortunately, but was gald I know him in the first place.
He shall remain the one and only champion of carrot in a box
just found out that he passed through this video, I'll miss his humor, RIP to one of the funniest
R.I.P Sean. Thank you for all the laughs you have given us ❤
RIP Sean.
RIP Sean. One of the funniest of all time. Only wanted to make people smile and its absolutely gutting to see him go so soon ❤️
A true legend! Sleep well my friend
This video should be 1 hour long at least.
Rest in peace legend, you will be missed
Thank God that I have had the joy of being entertained by this very funny man.
A vets cloth. 🤣🤣
Sean, going to miss your poetry. Seriously funny guy. Only time I cried inside is when I heard you passed away.
l e g e n d - RIP
Oh my god. What a shock. He gave me so many laughs. Rest In Peace
i think the best compliment i could give him is that i never thought he’d make me cry from anything other than laughter, rest in peace Sean Lock
Jimmy Carr: What would you like your orbituary to say? Sean Lock: I dont care.... I'll be dead. Ideally Id like it just to say NOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOO AAAHHHHHHHH"  Me: NOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOO AAAHHHHHHHH  We cant write tears :(
Loved this man.
Cats does countdown will never be the same. RIP Sean
RIP Mr Lock, the best to ever grace 8 out of 10 cats
comedy legend
A very challenging thank!
Didn't even have to try to be funny, that was the beauty. Fly high Sean, you left an unbelievable legacy!
RIP legend
Rest in peace, television won’t be the same💙
Sean Lock RIP lost but never forgotten 😢
R.I.P such a funny chap! Sad loss 😢
When i first found 8 out of 10 cats i was immediately drawn to sean and his hilarious personality, jokes and humour. To hear that he’s gone is truly heartbreaking, he was really the reason i used to watch this. I hope he is resting easy knowing he has bought laughs ands tears (of laughter) thought out his life. Rest in peace 🕊✨
A fitting tribute for a comedy legend. This is certainly the best way for fans to remember him. Such a talent that has been taken from us all way too soon. Our thoughts and love are, of course, with his family at this difficult time. Hopefully it will bring them some comfort to see and hear the outpouring of love and admiration that the UK and beyond have for this man. RIP Sean
One of the most underrated comedians of our generation. Will be sorely missed
What a legend, taken too soon...RIP Sean.
RIP Sean.
RIP Sean. Didn't even know he was ill. I know everybody was worried about his voice in newer episodes. Really sad..
R.I.P TO THE FUCKING LEGEND THAT IS   SEAN LOCK 🙏
Legends will never be forgotten, Rest in peace Sean Lock
R.I.P you comedy genius!
When I started in my current position, I had just discovered Sean Lock. During lunch break I was watching the "BEAMRULES" episode and I was cracking so loudly with tears of laughter running on my cheek and my new colleagues thought I was 100% crazy. Greetings from Finland, you will be missed
Total legend. Hilarious man with an amazing wit. RIP mate
Just heard the news, what sad news  thinking of his family and friends.  He could banter with the best of them.
The world is now a sadder place.  Thank you Sean, for being Sean.
😭😭😭
a true comic mind and a joy to watch.  thanks for bringing us so much laughter sean.
Absolutely tragic loss, will always remember you Sean
What a legand
Sean Lock's features on 8o10CDC will remain some of the funniest material in history. I think the fact that Lock looked so average, so normal made his bizarre sets all th funnier. A very very talented man who will be forever missed.
Genuinely so gutted by his passing.
❤❤❤
My sister and I are heartbroken by this news. So very very sad. Condolences to the family and friends of Sean Lock. Honestly, he will be missed by all including his fans. x
I wonder if the producers will want to proceed without Sean.  Such a unique talent, his presence made 8/10 does Countdown something much more than the usual panel show format.
Just received this sad news. Rest in Peace
Honestly I'm absolutely devastated about his passing.  I seen someone reccomend on twitter to produce his book. "The tiger who came for a pint" and give the money raised to cancer research.
It still hasn’t properly set in. Thought I was just watching another best bits video like normal and then it got to the last frame. Rest easy, Sean.
My favourite comedian of all time, hearing the news yesterday was like I'd lost a close friend. RIP Sean ❤️
When I first watched Sean, I became an instant fan. Sean was an intelligent comedian with an auto - randomizer that kept you on your toes, my all time favorite clip from Sean was on "The Big Fat Quiz" Where he tore into the performance of the kids from Mitchell Brooke Primary School about their acting, true comedy gold that no one but Sean could have pulled off, He will be missed.   Thank You for the laughs Sean, Rest In Peace.
Thanks for all these laughters!
RIP Sean 🙏💯
I'm heartbroken
The man was a genius.
Aww, man. Such a tragedy. Can't believe this guy is no longer with us.
RIP Sean, one of the best comics. Watching you live was one of the best times I've had! The beamrules gag is still gets me whenever I watch it! A true great and will be sadly missed
Sean was brilliant. Such a terrible loss for the comedy community. RIP fella. You will be sorely missed...Especially on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown...It wont be the same.
180 downvotes? Smh he’s probably up there laughing still though. Thinking of family and friends and those he made an impression on when they met him… and all his fans… rest in peace. Legend. I’ll never forget him. (Never met him but the laughs he gave me even in the toughest times… )
Thank you Sean Lock ...
Arw what the fuck man. That sucks. RIP you grumpy genius.
Stop omg
You will be sorely missed Sean.
Always heartbreaking when a comedian passes. They bring so much joy and make life so much better for us all. Sean Lock did that tenfold!
What sad bastards down-vote a memorial video? RIP Sean, You were one of the best and helped make this show.
Nooooooooooo! Whyyyyyyyy! Aaaaaaaah!
you know someone is funny when they make other comedians laugh uncontrollably. R.I.P. Sean
Thank you Sean. RIP.
The Beamrules bit is absolute genius 👌
Damn... just damn
he looked so well and id never guess he had cancer. Sean was a great comedian and quick witted guy.
Whhaaattt??? Nooooo. Did he?!?! Literally the only reason I watched 8 out of 10 cats does countdown. May he always have the carrot.
This has had me In tears.
We're all heart broken Sean. We miss you and you will forever bring smiled and joy to us any many others in the future. Rest in peace Sean ❤
I didn't know it had happened, I thought the title was a joke :( He was the funniest guy on earth to me, no one or thing has made me cry with laughter as much as Sean, bye mate
I always found that first clip very profound and has always stuck with me "I don't think the dictionary has enough words in it to describe me".
my favourite comedian hands down!! no filter....the carrot in the box was a classic! he will never be replaced! so sad
Sean Lock was the one of the funniest comics of his generation and we're richer for having been able to witness his genius.   Condolences to his family, friends and all 8 out of 10 Cats fans
Just to let you know. 8 out of 10 cats does countdown was just a one off special, derived from the original. It was so good that it surpassed the original  and Sean Lock was an absolute integral part of it. A genius, deadpan comic that didn't pander to pc correctness. My thoughts go to his family and friends
One of your national fucking treasures.
One of the GREATS
That last picture brought a tear to my eye. May he rest in peace!
rip will be missed by millions.
Let's pray with me for all the people suffered, lost loved ones and still standing, still shining. Hat's off to those brave souls. 🙏
I've never actually cried for a stranger untill this news hit me yesterday .
Nazi Island
I have watched British Comedy for many many years and Sean was always a face I loved to see. My thoughts are with his family and everyone grieving his loss. He will be missed. Rest in peace Sean <3
2021 continuing to be a downward spiral, RIP you seal clubbing legend.
"Noooooooo Whyyyyyyyy Noooooooo"
Absolute legend world is a sadder place without your humour RIP FELLA
I live in Israel. If it weren't for youtube I wouldn't have had a chance to see this brilliant man. Even from far away, in a different country, a different culture, he will be missed. He made me cry with laughter numerous times. Thank you and RIP
sean what a lose
Incredible man, such sad news. He had an amazing way of making everyone fall apart laughing. R.I.P. Sean Lock
Condolences to his colleagues and family
Absolute legend
8 Out of 10 cats doew countdown will never be the same. Rest In Peace, Sean. You were a very funny man. Gone too soon.
Easily could have been 30 minutes long. RIP Sean.
What a great legacy of simple yet complex humour. Many years of reruns to watch :)
Heartbroken. RIP Sean
Who remembers his Spine in the Sack bit?
Rest in Peace, from a fan from the Netherlands, i discovered this channel 4 and amongst others, sean lock. Laughed my ass off. Thank you. Hope he didnt suffer.
One of the best, such a sad loss to comedy, great man
Rip you legend
RIP ,one of the greats😟
I didn’t even know he was sick
God he was a genius, so sad I'm taking the day off work, fuck em, I'm watching Sean all day, it's like loosing a family member.
Absolute legend
Rectum of the year gets me every time. Claudia almost died.
lovely x
There was no comedian stronger Who wrote limericks about Wonga From laughter we cried, Claud, Jim - almost died Now laughter we have - no longer...
The world is a little bit less bearable when you left. RIP Sean Lock.
:'(
An absolute legend. RIP
Sean Lock always always makes me laugh. Even watching this video of clips I've seen hundreds of times I was laughing just as much as the first. For a moment I had forgotten he had passed away, which is the greatest thing about comedy, it makes you forget all the bad things in life for a brief moment. Then I saw the end caption and remembered that the world has lost one of it's greatest comedians. Rest in Peace Sean.
If there is a heaven up there I promise you they’ll be pissing themselves now. Rip so glad I got to see you live 💔
❤
Sean Lock made this show - a proper unique sense of humour with perfect timing and delivery. The 'Beamrules' & Christmas Card mix up in this video and the vouchers are both absolute genius. RIP Sean
Sean is so funny...I can't believe he is no longer here. I love watching 8 out of 10 Cats and Would I Lie To You? Sincerest condolences to his family and friends.
Nooooo whyyyyyy noooooo…… 😢
Sean Lock would always, without fail, leave me in fits of laughter. Such a brilliantly funny man. RIL Sean ❤😔
Was always one of those comedians I could keep coming back to and keep laughing at the same jokes over and over. Forever will be an all time favourite of mine. Rest in peace Sean.
Sad indeed to hear that Sean has passed away will be missed very much.
Every time Sean was on this show I'd be laughing like Claudia or Miles. He was an absolute genius, I'm very sad that he's gone, such a waste! It's a shame he never got to do Taskmaster, he was absolutely made for that show. We'll miss you Sean.
Thanks for the laughs Sean, rest in peace 💙
RIP Sean.  From way Down Under, here in Australia, your dry humour and sharp wit was deeply admired and appreciated.  Thank you for the many laughs.
I’m so devastated still!
What a lovely bloke
Love you Sean!
I suppose they going to stop the show now
The God of my kind of humour.  RIP Funny man 💔
A true comedy legend. RIP Sean
Whenever I need lifting up I would search YouTube for clips and shows featuring Sean Lock as these never failed to make me laugh. Thank you. RIP.
RIP Mr Jangles. You will be greatly missed.
Your best achievement? Making so many people cry with laughter! RIP
This man helped me a lot laughing through COVID time, can't wait to watch more of the 8 out of 10 cats series (now that I finished the countdown version) A true comedic genius, a great loss. RIP and condolences to his family and friends from a french fan
Sean was one of the only comedians within the panel that made me burst out laughing with every word he uttered, jokes or otherwise. Sending love to his family in this tough times. Love from Ghana
Sooooo funny! What a legend, gone too soon. R.I.P
Can't quite believe this. He will be sorely missed. My heart breaks for his family and comedy at large.
This man ate a whole pot of whelks. May he rest in peace.
sean, you made me laugh when I could not.. rest in peace❤
Such sad news - R.I.P. Sean - I'll miss you ...
He was the best. His mind was fantastic.
He was one of my favourite comics, a true talent. He had passed too young, but he is forever immortal in memory.
I'm shocked and saddened by yesterday's awful news. RIP Sean Lock
I think my favourite moment was when him and miles talked about hitler
i hope they do more in his memory than just a youtube compilation
Sean genuinely made me laugh so hard.....such a quick mind and great sense of humour. RIP mate.
the world just got a little less funny
There will only be one sean lock RIP will be greatly missed ......BEAMRULES
If I could reanimate anyone, I'd reanimate Sean Lock and put him on a paradise island
8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown will never be the same without you Sean Lock. R.I.P.
R.I.P you legend, you will be missed by all, thank you for making us laugh so much, cheers bud.
I've kept a framed photo of Sean for several years as a joke since one was brought on as a family heirloom on the show, but I never thought the joke would outlive him. It's incredibly sad now to hear he's gone, but I am sure his style will live on, and thankfully there's years of his comedy out there to look back on and laugh to. RIP
Bloody sad news.
I noticed his voice was more strained in last year's series. I hope he wasn't in any discomfort.
Rip you legend
Lord, why did you take Sean Lock and left Rupert Murdoch alive?
The dislikes are from Americans that don't understand British humour.
You will genuinely be missed
Just heard. RIP dude. Thanks for the laughs.
I can believe this news, it feels like I'm in a wrong dimension. This is just heart breaking My thoughts and prayers to the family.
I can't believe this. Hands down the funniest person I've ever witnessed. I'm so sad. Rest in peace.
Sean Lock a rare jem of the British comedy circuit. A view of life that was so unique.  Observational comedy at the very highest level. Taken way too early.  I will miss him so much. Irreplaceable on 8 out of 10 cats does Countdown . Hope you're up there in the pub and carrying the torch for the average bloke everywhere.   Rest in peace Sean.
Legend. Very funny, gracious man.
An absolute legend!!! RIP Sean
RIP modern day sensation
Was sad to hear the news last night. RIP Sean
im am absolutely devastated i will never forget how much this amazing man has made me laugh over the years. Rest in peace Sean the impact you had on me will be with me forever
Oh the ending :'-( RIP
A comedy genius, what a shame. Another person taken too early by cancer. RIP dude.
Rip to one very funny man will be missed
Never have i laugh while crying in sadness.
Such a sad day. Thanks for all the laughs Sean.
R.i.P sean lock 👌
You could tell the later shows when he didnt look a well man but he didnt lose any of that genius humour; carrot in a box 1 & 2 one of the goats; RIP
Rest in piece carrot champ.
So sad. Life is short. Live it up whilst you can. RIP Sean
We’ll never see another master class of carrot in a box...rip Sean, absolute legend 💔
The greatest Carrot in a Box player ever IMO
RIP Sean lock. An amazing, clever,  and very funny man. Thoughts to all your family and loved ones. Your be sadly missed 👍
RIP and thank you for all the laughs you funny funny man!
Sad day for Britain, R. I. P you beautiful man, you'll be winning rectum of the years up in heaven now lool
Rest in peace, you are a sensation!
RIP
Very sad news. RIP Sean you will be missed on 8 out of10.
Oh Sean, I cried when I heard this truly heartbreaking news. You were the funniest comedian ever and I know there's thousands of grieving fans....and cats! Mega condolences to your family, your friends and your many many fans. R.I.P you absolute bloody legend. THANK YOU for the years of laughter xxxx
RIP Good Sir. You will missed.
There better be an actual proper tribute to him on channel 4 TV. He deserves it after all those years
How can people dislike a tribute to a legend?
R.I.P. Sean, thaks for all the laughs
Ah fuck this guy was hilarious.   Bring him back and we will trade in Brendan Schaub and Seinfeld.
In one vid you have a very clever and observational comedian of great worth, and then you have Trevor Noah, racebating buffoon that went to the USA and found his niche. He should have taken Ranganathan with him Noah not Sean. Sean will be really missed as someone who was funny and loveable.....
RIP Sean, the only panel show comedian who never failed to make me belly laugh. So quick, so clever, so cynical... just a brilliant comedian and writer. A lot of his throwaway comments were often funnier than another guest's best gag. He was wonderful on QI, and of course 8 out of 10 Cats he was in his element.  I didn't even know he was sick so to hear of his death this morning was heartbreaking. Thanks for all the laughs, Sean.  Also if you've never watched 15 Storeys High, there's never been a better time! Recommended for some classic Sean Lock absurdity.
What an offensive yet lovely man.  RIP to one of the best comedian's out there.
Rip. Condolances for the family, friends and the world of comedy.
Rip funny, funny man
Really going to miss him. He had a great sense of humour.
Sad news may you rest in peace you beautiful man. ❤️
"That's a challenging wank" Sean Lock

The people that make you laugh are the people you miss the most. RIP Sean
Awesome guy
Rest In Peace. May you never have to eat a pot full of whelks again.
Rip Sean you absolute specimen of a man
Comic genius, a real loss!
Take some comfort in knowing that he'll be entertaining us on the other side. See you there Sean!
Comic genius.
RIP Sean

Sean Lock will have people laughin forever ! A legend and the most impressive title... comedians comedian!
If making people laugh could keep you living, Sean Lock would’ve lived forever 💔~R.I.P Sean
Claudia’s reaction to Rectum of the Year is my favourite thing ever
I think Claudia's "please stop talking" whilst in a fit of giggles sums up how funny this guy was. He'd come out with some gems, right out of left field.  RIP Sean, I know you'll be 'jammin' wherever you may be.
So sad over this news Having a been in honour of Sean Lock, Cheer Sean!
We shared names. But I think you deserved it the most. 8 out of ten has been my favourite forever. May God Rest his soul. And may we all laugh at the man he was in the nicest way 💙💙
Brilliant funny man.  Will be missed.
It's been a long time since someone has made me laugh so hard I choked on my own saliva. RIP Sean Lock.
Another one gone. All we're going to be left with soon are people like Russell Brand and Rob Rydon.
Just so so sad. You’ll be miss 😭
RIP you beautiful genius.
Thank you for the laughs Sean ❤

So sad, love from America
"The money I embezzled from the RNLI" Pure class. R I P sir.
I had just watched the 'rectum of the year', 'seal clubbing', and 'challenging wank' clips last night. Brilliant comedian. Thoughts to his family. RIP Sean.
I shed some tears when I learned he was gone last night. And then I watched carrot in a box. Sublime
He made his mark on the world.. That’s all we can hope for.
The only comedian who has ever made me literally cry with laughter.
Mate this guy was incredibly funny he will be extremely missed 😩😢
I love the cats does countdown repeats on freeview. I loved the chemistry between him, Jon and Jimmy. Rest in peace.
<3 <3 <3
Channel 4 should donate the revenue generated by the views this video receives on the back of the sad news of Sean lock passing.  RIP Sean.  +1 to donate to cancer treatment.
The most unbelievable comedian, Laughing till I cried, that's what you did to me Sean, you were the star of 8 out of 10 cats, nothing will be the same now, totally gutted you are not with us anymore, you were funny for all the right reasons, and you will be missed beyond belief ♥️
Didn't sound the same.. was eating him... Last two clips
Brilliant! Will be missed.
I can't believe he's gone. What an absolute talent. Rip you legend, miss you already😔
"That is a challenging wank right there!" :D
god damn I loved this guy...😪
A brilliant brilliant man who pushed boundaries made us think made us laugh and Never Ever apologised…RIP Sean and sincere condolences to your loved ones…
I don't really get affected by celebrity deaths but something hit me hard yesterday with the news that Sean passed.  An incredible man. I'll miss him.
RIP SEAN. You have always managed to get a laugh out of me, mate. Your legacy will always love on.
Very sorry he's dead but he was about as funny as a drowning dog
I’d always come to these videos and end up in tears laughing. Ironic, isn’t it that now I’ll have to laugh through the tears.  R.I.P. Sean Lock. Thank you for every smile.
RIP
Rip Sean, thanks for the laughs
What a bloke. Can’t thank him enough for all the laughs he brought me. RIP
Rest in peace Sean. You will be missed!
I wish I had the chance to see him live. Truly unique and surreal. Will miss him.
Rest in peace Sean Lock. Just effortlessly talented. Could make you laugh with a single word due his unique delivery and there'll never be another like him
This hurts so much, RIP Sean ❤
😢😢😢😢
The only reason i watch cats does countdown.  The chemistry between sean and jon.  Godspeed sean
i thought i was done crying, apparently not. Rest In Peace to one of the best comedians ever known.
I'm going to embezzle some money from the RNLI in his memory . RIP you Legend .
Absolute legend
I’m so shocked 😞 rip Sean 🤍
RIP to an effortlessly funny and witty man, gone too soon.  You'll be missed Sean, thanks for the laughs mate. Gonna keep watching the videos on YouTube to keep your laughs alive.  I'll never forget what I learned from you: "If you want to get some tapeworm, eat some pork". 😂  Cheers.
Sean made comedy effortless. A real sad loss. RIP
RIP Funny man.  8 out of cats will never seem the same again.
You really was special
Oh no.  There's one less source of laughter in the world.
RIP you legend!
Sean is a deadset legend and arguably the person who made this show what it was. It is good to know he is free from the terrible grip of cancer and is out of pain. Condolences to all affected. An absolute comedy God! R.I.P Mr Jangles.
R.I.P LEGEND!
Rest in peace, rest well 🖤 you will be missed, condolences to his family and friends 💙
Noooooo wwwwhhhhyy noooooo aaaah :(
I'm really glad I found this show a few years ago, he's brought many smiles to me in much needed times.
This upset me so much more than I thought it ever could. I feel like I barely just heard about Sean when I stumbled upon a clip from Countdown maybe a year or two ago. Now I've seen almost every episode and just started his show 15 Storeys High. Wish I had a chance to see him live doing stand up, but I live in the U.S.A. and money and timing were never right  Rest in Peace. You were one of the comedians I laughed the hardest at, consistently. You will be so missed  I hope your family copes well enough at this tradegy. I will send them whatever love I can from here
I'm hoisting a pint in your honor tonight, Sean...and singing "If you want to get a tapeworm eat some pork..."
RIP Sean Lock
Noooooooo!  Whyyyyyyyyyyy?!  Noooooooo!  Ahhhhhhhhhh!
I thought the only emotion I would feel by watching Sean would be happiness, not devastation. Such a great man, R I P.
“I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex tonight” - What a thing to say. I must’ve watched that video more than 50 times. An absolute legend of comedy! I feel like a polar bear trapped in a tiny cage without his comedy. RIP
Will never forget when he ate the whole tin of welks
He’ll live on forever
Another one gone :(
What genuine side splitting, belly laughter and unexpected tangent, observation and surreal way of delivering humour, you got to be doing something right when your fellow comedians can't stop laughing at what you say, and wait in anticipation for your next line. Brilliant.  RIP
Goodbye Sean Lock. Respect.
I was hoping it was a life tribute ,not his leaving us. We have these videos thank goodness.
He was so fucking funny. Rest easy 💔  you will be missed.
RIP Sean. You will be missed. Thanks for the memories.
RIP sean 8 out of ten won’t be the same now.
He was so from the wall.  I remember most him denegrating young theater actors from  kindergarden.
Legend
R.I.P Sean, and thanks for the never ending laughs 👍❤
Nooooooooooooooooooooo
“You pair of tossers” “Bent over and set the sprinklers off”
Sean Lock in a box
Couldn't believe when Sean Lock died of cancer at 58 popped into my google feed. I thought he would be kicking on for a long, LONG time yet. Rip man
no comic out there has had me in stiches like sean, he was right all along definitely a sensation.
Absolute legend! Rip Sean Lock.
thank you so much, Sean. you will be missed. ❤️
Gonna miss you mate. Cheers for the laugh
RIP Funny man 😢
The man had funny in his bones!
I still can't believe he's not going to give us all any belly laughs any more. One of the funniest men I've ever seen with such a unique style. May almighty God rest his dear soul.
I found out about Sean Lock far too late in life. So sad to see a comedian I just got into pass so soon in his life. RIP Mr. Lock, you are severely missed.
Rest in Pisstakes, you comedy genius,
Such a sad loss of a brilliant man. I watch EOOTCDC every night and Sean's dry humour and fast wit will live on evermore in repeats and memories. Couldn't believe it when I read the news this morning, he never showed a sign of his illness on the show. RIP Sean.
Im American and just recently stumbled onto 8 out of 10 cats does countdown after watching jimmy’s specials. thats a real shame he was my favorite part of the probably sue able YouTube compilation channels. R.I.P ya silly limey.
So so so sad... Seen him live once and he was amazing
R.I.P Seemed a lovely gent and you can't knock anyone thats lifes misson was to put smiles on faces.  Brilliant, hilarious, will be missed.  Thank you for laughs
Rest in peace
Honestly, I watch "8 out of 10 cats does countdown" everyday & Sean time and time again made a bad day good. Absolute 💯 comedy genius. The world has just lost a real, true legend. RIP 🙏
He will be so missed..never failed to make you laugh
The sheer volume of tributes from comedians and other people who worked with him, not only was he such a beloved performer to the fans, he was a special talent to his peers. RIP to a legend.
Absolute legend! Will be massively missed
RIP to the comedian's comic.
I always feel for Claudia on the bit at the end.
It's really to sad to say that all good things must come to an end. Sean Lock was a comedian's comedian. A Great Man and a True legend. Prayers for his family and friends.
A memory from Harry Hill:  "I heard he was in a hospice for a bit of a rest. I called him up. “Wow!” I said. “A hospice, what’s that like?” “It’s OK,” he said “… and the sex is amazing.”"  RIP you brilliant man.
So sad wot great person x and funny always watch the show...my Love is with family friends xx sooo funny xxx Nice Good Lovely man xx
❤️‍🔥rip❤️‍🔥
R.I.P Sean. One of the first two British Comedians I came across. Never hesitated to push the boundaries of jokes. Reviving Nazis, Gritty Limericks. Carrots in boxes, How bad the acting of the kids were. Some were harsh but they were jokes and should be left at that. The smile you brought upon many saved a lot more than others were able to do for you.
Woke up to horrible news. My favourite English comedian is dead. If I could bring anything back it would be Sean Lock. Condolences from Sweden. 😢
RIP :(
oh my gosh, I love this guy, can't believe you are gone mate, RIP
we all can write a lot but one thing is for sure we will miss you Sean Lock, you made us laugh and you will be remembered by your loved ones :) Rest in peace.
Gutted. Absolutely gutted.
You’ll be sadly missed Sean.
I went from crying from laughter... to crying
Rest in peace Sean! ❤️ Iconic legend ❤️🙏
Omg.. I didn’t expect to cry in the way to work. I had no idea he was sick. RIP Sean.
Died at 58 from cancer. It's too damn early! We lost another legend.   RIP Sean Lock
RIP u absurdly hilarious man
such a sad loss. he really did make me laugh out loud. amazing person. R.I.P.
so sad
So sad to hear of Shaun’s passing, given me so many laughs over the last two decades.
Saw him all the time on QI a frequent guest on that show. How sad,
Rip Sean.... watch 8 out of 10 just to see what he would come up with next....  standups are brill. Sean The GOAT
RIP Sean, you were always awesome. Loved you on QI too!!!
Damn, doesn't seem real. A life well lived.
Rip Sean.. Thank you for your gift of laughter 🙏
Nooooo, whyyyyyyy, nooooooo, aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh
My God, so funny, sadly missed, God rest mate!
Sean got me through a tough divorce. I never met him, but I loved him anyway.
rip legend, loved the man
With all the celebrity deaths that have happened in the last few years, everyone was going ape shit over the death of this actor and that singer, Bowie and Michael, Williams and Rickman, but to be honest, I didn't really care all that much.  But hearing about Sean passing away...man. That hurts. Him and Joe were the main reason I watched 8 out of 10 Cats. Sean just absolutely cracked me up. He never came across as a try-hard. He just seemed so genuinely funny. I feel almost like I've lost a friend. Rest in peace ❤️
So much for this wonderful man. Rip dear Sean 💔
Men will never forget his famous last words: 'You can't bribe pigeons!'.
Devastating news. Undisputed world champion of carrot in a box
Oh my goodness - how sad. This comedy genius got me through some very dark times. Terrible loss.
Loved Sean Lock on Would I Lie To You from India. RIP Sean.
Very sad, but he conveyed humour at all times.
you always miss    what you take for granted             in your face  Comedy .  no i said this
I think it's time someone stepped up and released his fragrance.  I'd buy it.
Top lad rip
Rest in Peace, founder of Nazi Island
RIP Sean thanks for all the good laughs
The comedian’s comedian’s comedian.
So sad. He made me cry with laughter. Genius. Rest oh wise one
Goodbye Sean.
What?!?!?!?!!? OMG. Condolences to all, especially those that were close to Sean.
I hope so much that he gets his "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, noooooooooooooooo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaah... :("  R.I.P. one of the funniest people on this sad planet.   Give him a tribute he deserves... It should be hours long!
I was heartbroken to hear this. I love this man. Always watch him when I felt depressed.  😔 😔  R.I.P You wonderfully hilarious man
Thank you Sean! I will always remember you!
Condolences to Sean's family. Thank you Sean, for your comedic genius which made me cry with laughter on numerous occasions. Rest in peace.
You will be missed,  in a special way,  and thank you for leaving us your happiness,  and making us laugh.  RIP.  With love.
RIP 😢 thanks for the laughs.
When I was on my arse and down there, this wonderful man was the light at the end of the tunnel, he brought me to floods of laughter through the hardest of times. A true comedy genius.
We will truly miss you Sean you were one of the best
I'm in tears of laughter and sadness, what a man.
Loved him.
All them shows will be much harder to watch knowing he's never gonna be on again.
Watching him for years.. Even still had plans to see him live after we were allowed to travel again.  Rest in Peace 🙏
gonna miss this man. brilliant comedian
Completely gutted by this news. Thank you for all the moments of cry-laughter. RIP Sean.
I was crying with laughter until the end. Now, I’m just crying.
Such a consistently funny guy. Way too soon.
Gutted ! Bless him and his family. X
As an American, I have no one to explain the actual grief I feel knowing this man is no longer here.   I’ve loved watching his comedy for many years. I guess this is why I’m here.   Wherever he is now I know he’s giving the joy of humor.
RIP
Wow, hard to believe we'll never see these spontaneous, original, brilliant bits of comedy. Eating the welks, offering not to spit on Miles Jupp, bashing the children of Mitchell Brook Primary School, carrot in a box, his hilarious children's books and so much more. A true comedic talent ho wasn't afraid to think outside the box or to cross barriers. I rarely laugh out loud, but Sean could really make me crack up. Much love and strength to his family, friends, colleagues and other loved ones. Thank you for all the laughter, all the best from Belgium.
Good Night Mister Jangles.
Best in the business!  Not many can make you laugh out loud all the time!
Bloody fucking legend, god he will be missed
So sad, a comedy genius, and a nice man, condolences to his family, comedy lovers will miss him😪
So so very sad. Still watching repeats of the repeats on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown and never tire of Sean, or any of the cast. He will be sadly missed. 😢😢🙏🙏
RIP Sean you absolute legend! You helped me through my darkness and cancer battle. I have nothing but love for all who were lucky enough to have been you're friends and family. You truly are a comical treasure and I will never forget you ❤ xxxxx
🙏🏿❤️
R.I.P .... brilliant,, so funny 😂.. sadly missed 😢
I couldn'tbelive my eyes at the end of this video.   I had no idea he died.  I'm an American, so I'm  not up to date on a lot of UK news and these YouTube videos are all I see of Cats Does Countdown.  He was the best part of 8 Out of 10 Cats.    Absolutely gutted to the core.
I got hooked when i watched his nazi island idea while i was randomly scrolling in facebook. RIP legend.
161 people downvoted this video. WTF is wrong with you?!
R.I P. to the Carrot in a box undefeated champion
My dad and I were genuinely upset when we found out about his passing
An F in the comments, lads. We have lost a legend
So sad💐
Rest in peace Sean lock
R.I.P my dude.. 💔
Rip Sean 😭
I can't believe it. I never knew him but I feel really cut up. Rest in peace Sean and love to his wife and children at this devastating time.
He was the most considerate lover
What’s the name of the show?
Genius! RIP Sean, thank you for all the laughs at my lowest and highest times. You will be missed x
Such a shame. He was hilarious
The rectum joke 😂😂 rip
I can't believe this tragic news. Rest in peace.
Thank you,  Sean, for sharing your comedic genius with us all these years.
Sean, thank you, you'll be sorely missed. Your humour helped me get through a really shitty job and time in my life
This hilarious man may no longer be physically here, but good god what a legacy he leaves behind.  Vale Sean Lock - the Ultimate Carrot in a Box Genius.
It broke my heart to hear this news today, he made me laugh so much. Ugh he will be so missed.
Such sad news, R.I.P
What a legend. One of the funniest men to have lived.
Laughing through my tears. RIP, Sean.
I can’t believe he’s gone. Many a time I’ve laughed until I hurt because of Sean. My deepest sympathies to his family
Finally I know how people who had never met Diana felt. Life will never be the same without Sean.
GOD BLESS YOU SEAN. THE FUNNIEST MAN ON TV. REST WELL SIR
Oh wow. Just found out about his passing by seeing this scrolling through YouTube. One of the greatest British comedians of all time! Much love to his family from Houston, Texas!
RIP a genuinely amazing comedian
This hit hard, really going to miss Sean. rip
1st time I watched him I did laugh alot an after that he was 1 of my small amount of favorite comedians.
R.I.P legend.
RIP man you will be missed 😢
RIP Sean. Thank you for all the laughs. Taken far too soon
RIP sean the world seems a little darker without your unquie comedy
Love you mate. U cracked me up many of times.  RIP
R.I.P. Mr Sean.  I'm actually still in shock.  And what the hell happened to Reginald D. Hunter??
"That's a challenging wank" Sean Lock
I'm just pretending he's not gone.
Rest in peace man, you'll be missed
I am absolutely devastated.  Sean you have changed my life and I am so thankful and grateful for you.  God be by the sides of his family and the world of friends that are grieving the loss of this brilliant man.  Thank you Sean Lock.
R.I.P Sean terrible news
Holy shit... It sucks
Living alone, grinding through school, eating dinner in absolute silence, I can't thank Sean enough for the amount of Joy his company brought me. I hope wherever you are Sean, hope you are as happy and as carefree as you were here!
We should throw his ashes in Piers Morgan’s eyes just like he wanted. RIP
SEAN<3
The man is an absolute legend RIP
RIP Sean
RIP Sean Locke. End of an era.
😞
will definitely miss his brand of humor, kept me entertained for many a night.... RIP you cunny funt
😭😭😭😭😭
Rest in peace 😞🌹
I was laughing away in bliss just to see the last bit... not realizing its true. Just killed me.  Rest in peace. May he find carrots in a box in heaven.
R.I.P. Sean  You will be missed
Heartbroken. He was a treasure to the comedic community.
Nooooooo Whyyyyyyy Noooooooooooo Arrrrghhhh
Sean lock kept us laughing and entertained on 8/10cats, through waves and waves of the plague.  Top tier comedic mind, sadly his time is more finite than his talent.  Sorely missed in our household.
Thanks for all the Sean, Rest In Peace.
To the master of absurdity...Vale Sean Lock....Vale
Absolutely gutted hearing he passed. What a loss. Rest in peace you funny bastard.
You’ll be forever missed you glorious genius
He hated playing Countdown, and he was the biggest reason I've watched every episode. Absolute master.
😒😞😢😥😭😭😭
So sad, he was such a different comedian. Truly an original. our loss.
Sean.. biggest achievement in life?  The Money I embezzled from the RNLI...   It’s a sad day RIP legend
RIP
I am so sorry to hear this.
One of my favourite comedians ever, one par with chapelle in my eyes. The world will laugh less now hes gone
Reigning undefeated carrot in a box champion. RIP Legend, the world is a lesser place with you gone !!
My best friend always gets news ahead of me and told me of Sean's passing. I usually spend 99% of the time laughing with my best friend, but this time it was nothing but tears and grieving. Sean Lock, one of my favourite comedians of all time, up there with the likes of Bob Mortimer, Bill Bailey, Ricky Gervais...  I'll miss him greatly. Never a dull moment on 8 Out Of 10 Cats, the time he went around America with Jon Richardson, the stand up specials, talk shows.... the list goes on. We will always love you Sean!
Comedic Genius
Rip 🙏
Sean was absolutely brilliant and hilarious, and he seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He will be greatly missed. Rest In Peace 😢
Rest in Peace, you made us laugh.
8 out of 10 Cats is a show this American stumbled on randomly on YouTube. I was hooked and I've watched every episode available, lots of them multiple times. Rest in peace, Sean. You'll be missed.
È un peccato che Sean Lock morto, non è vero, dopo essere stato in Confinamento e restrizioni di blocco e poi aver sollevato restrizioni di confinamenti inoltre tu vede niente comicale. Inutile senso dell'umorismo che ha anche agitato molte persone che hanno quasi concluso la sua carriera. Quindi sono nove vite e così via etcetera. Antonio Jacqi Lucrezia. Buon fortuna.
My new nineteen year old son and I genuinely grieving today. I am reminded of Spike Milligan passing. A treasure. Much missed.
I know I'm not the only who was wondering the reason for Sean having been off the show for a while and then coming back looking much thinner and with his voice changed. I guess all is now explained and it has confirmed our worst fears at the time. It's going to be hard going for Cats Does Countdown to come back and be funny under the circumstances but, as corny as it sounds, I'm sure that Sean would want the show to go on.
Wot a legend ill never forget
He made me tearful with laughter, well done sir. I'll miss his classic natural wit.
nooooo!!!!  So sad!!!
Sean got me through some hard times and as I now fight what he fought he's even more with me. What a legend. Greetings from Finland.
Who would dislike this?
The best tribute I can think of is to say that I’ve been watching all the clips on YT, many of which I’d previously seen, & I’m still laughing to tears!….. My condolences to his family & friends  Thank you for all the laughs Sean, you will be missed
MANDY!
Great mind. Genius comedian. Thank you for all the laugh's
Carrot in a box!
I have literally spent the past week watching clips from 8OO10C and am heartbroken at this news. Prayers from America!
The night before one of the most important exams of my life, running on 30 hours awake and frantically studying, I watched a Sean Lock “best jokes” video to try and feel better, and ended up laughing for the first time in days. That little bit of joy made me pass that exam, and I will have a great job some day because I did. Thank you for being brilliant, Sean, for your wit and humour, and for eating dozens of whelks for ten grand. You will be missed very much. X
Broken hearted.  Thank you Sean ("challenging wank") Lock for much joy and laughter. The world is a bit less funny.  From the Mountains above Salt Lake City Utah, USA.
This one has affected me. Rest in comedy heaven Sean
Just a sad, sad day! Only other time I’ve been this gutted about the death of a celebrity is when Rik Mayall died. Sean was just funny to his core and his incredibly dark and dry sense of humour was a joy to watch. R.I.P Sean
Two of my favorite comedians die this close together first Trevor Moore and now Sean Lock. RIP
OMG - just looked it up after seeing this video.  RIP!  And  Eff Cancer!!!
He's was so, so good. RIP🕊
This man will always make me laugh when I need to. He’ll be sorely missed! RIP!
such a sad loss, legend
Fuck. Sean was amazing. Perfect combination of "fuck you" and "I love you". Work that paradox out!!! Life will never be the same - covid? Taliban? Stolen elections? Pffttt - all meaningless. Sean Lock has died - now THAT means something. RIP Sean 😢😢😢😢😢
Tempted to eat a 100 whelks in memory of Sean Lock. RIP.
RIP Sean from Germany
I am stunned that I have to live in a world without Sean Lock. His complete commitment to a comedic idea, however absurd, was truly beautiful to see. He made so many comedians on 8 Out of 10 cats laugh until they cried. My subscriptions to "Busty Foster Moms"  "Lapsed Catholic", and "Look at the State of Her!" magazines have ended. I'll see you forever on Youtube Sean, and I am thankful for that...
We Miss You Sean
Sean will be missed!!!
“I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex tonight” had me crying tears of laughter as did ‘that’s a challenging wank” and “The Tiger Who Came For a Pint” cheers me up whenever I see it. What’s great loss.
R I P..
Thanks for the laughs Sean. You'll be missed. RIP
I saw him doing standup in 2001 in Lewisham Yates Wine Lodge. He used to end his set by revealing he had a Riddler costume on, underneath his clothes. Check out pix of Frank Gorshin (not Jim Carrey), you'll see why. Riddle me this: why is cancer so sh*t? RIP Mr Lock
One of the funniest people on TV. You will be missed Sean. RIP
Wait a minute..why a tribute? Did he...? 😧

OH MAN he was so funny I liked him on that show.
Unbeaten carrot in a box champion
I will never forget Sean going on a tirade about how Jedward met Barack Obama, absolutely hilarious off the cuff
Gonna miss you on 8 out of 10 cats. Total legend.
Still in shock from the news. Been hooked on Sean since I started watching British television
People who dislike this video are human 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
:( he made me laugh and happy and I wish I could have told him that.
No, no, no, no NO!
Thanks for the laughs, Sean
Thoughts to his family. What a legend.
Oh man. This news is breaking hearts across the pond.
RIP sir Sean
RIP you genius man 😭❤️
Brilliant comedian rest in peace you funny funny man 🙏
I hate everything right now 😢
Terrible news to wake up to. I don't watch MSM, so I've only been notified this morning via YouTube. What a funny guy. The show won't be the same without him. R.I.P,  you funny bugger.
Carrot In A Box was one of the funniest things I have ever seen. I am terribly sorry top hear that Sean has passed. Rest Easy!
RIP you beautiful hilarious man!
The info made me so sad not gonna lie : (
Yes, Sean, I can't write tears.
I wish I hadn't found out about this before bed. Sean was the best kind of human you can be in my opinion. Didn't take life too seriously. Always looking for a joke. No better way to live, looking for a laugh. Tears coming from Austin, Texas.
Rest in peace legend 😭❤
RIP Sean. So many hours seeing you battle John Richardson.
Words……… there are no words. Deepest condolences to Sean’s family & loved ones. He will be deeply missed by a great many, including me. Thank you for all the laughs, sleep tight xx
I found 8 out of 10 cats just three weeks ago. Sean Lock was my favorite by far. This news makes me so very sad.
Don't be sad . We will all be joining him one day
One of the most underrated comedians ever. Rest in peace Sean.
Thank you, Sean. My younger years were richer for having you in them making me laugh myself silly. I'm really, really going to miss you. Tonnes of love, Locky <3
Sean lock is a national treasure he will be sorely missed He always made me laugh when I am feeling low RIP seam.
You always know you’re in for a treat the minute the camera points his way. Sean didn’t even have to talk, sometimes it was just a silly nod of the head that would get you into howls of laughter. Funny bones through and through. Only Bob Mortimer comes close, but even he will never shine as brightly as Sean Lock did. A genuinely sad day for comedy and the UK. I will forever watch these video clips. He will always be remembered.
What a legend. May he rest in peace
No!  Why?!  Aah!
RIP lock man
Coming home to a full mouse trap😂😂😂😂😂😂
such a sad lose of a great funny man. RIP Sean
Rest In Peace Eternal Sean .  Near a shady wall a rose once grew, Budded and blossomed in God's free light, Watered and fed by the morning dew, Shedding it's sweetness day and night.  As it grew and blossomed fair and tall, Slowly rising to loftier height, It came to a crevice in the wall Through which there shone a beam of light.  Onward it crept with added strength With never a thought of fear or pride, It followed the light through the crevice's length And unfolded itself on the other side.  The light, the dew, the broadening view Were found the same as they were before, And it lost itself in beauties new, Breathing it's fragrance more and more.  Shall claim of death cause us to grieve And make our courage faint and fall? Nay! Let us faith and hope receive-- The rose still grows beyond the wall,  Scattering fragrance far and wide Just as it did in days of yore, Just as it did on the other side, Just as it will forever-more.  I’ve just been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and I’m terrified. Please say something nice in a message, it would really mean so much to me . Dr.Louis 💯✌🏻🙏🏻👍
Rest In Peace, Sean. I absolutely loved him on 8 Out Of 10 Cats.
Probably one of the funniest I have ever seen on Count Down. RIP Sean Lock
How is it that people are downvoting this video. This guy was a fearless comedian who made everybody laugh, who held no punches, didn't give a shit what the lefty snowflakes said. Made his fellow guests on 8 out of 10 Cats piss themselves silly. And then, kept his Cancer to himself because he was not going to be a fucking crybaby victim. He wanted to be remembered for what he was, a funny man, a comedian who said whatever he thought would get a laugh no matter what the subject was.  He will be missed and 8 out of 10 cats will be poorer for his loss. And to those fuckers that downvoted this tribute, fuck you you dumb cunts. You wouldn't know comedy if it hit you in the face with a wet fish. Go and take your sad pathetic lives and jump into a garbage pile and die there you miserable twats. Sean Locke, you died too soon.
This sucks man, this show won't be the same without him if they decide to continue.
I’m absolutely heart broken! I had no idea and was in absolute shock when I heard the news. Forever he will be missed and forever loved. Rest In Peace our friend across the pond.
Thanks for all the laughs Sean o7
So sad. 💔 Thank you for giggles, chuckles and downright belly laughs, Sean.  Sincere sympathies to Sean’s family and friends. 💔
Genuinely funny man. RIP Sean. I think I can hear God laughing. Well... I can hear SOMEBODY laughing.
Rest in funny Pease. From NZ.
Gonna miss this man
if its truly that the good that die young, Rachel Riley will probably live forever...
A true legend, class act, gone too soon.
RIP Sean
I'm so so saddened by this news. I watched Sean for so long throughout highschool and up to now even. RIP. ❤️
Magical  Man✨His Humour was Magnificently Unique.✨🤩 ✨🤩✨Brilliant 👏
One of the greatest comedy minds ever. Rest in Peace
Gutted to hear this .rip sean
Gutted to hear about this, he was such a comic genius.  I found he'd gone within an hour of realising I needed a Covid test.  My favourite comedian is dead, and I might have Covid :(
Still in disbelief
He was a big smoker wasn't he? I haven' heard that he died, but I'm guessing its from lung cancer or something? Or throat cancer? I remember the last few years of Cats does Countdown him having problems speaking... his voice changing?
Rip💙
Thank you for the smiles, Sean.
What a legend. Genuinely hysterical guy. Really sad news
An icon and a true legend of both British comedy & humour in general.  I am saddened I never got to meet him
Noooooooooooo. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Nooooooooo. Aaaaaah. We can't write tears.
It's just brilliant the bizarre stuff he comes up with, ie, the unpredictably makes it extra funny.
Now who's going to revive the Nazis? Sean know how to push the boundaries...hilariously!
gutted..
Fucking legendary
Like so many others, I loved watching Sean and will miss him very much. He was a talented, smart and funny man that never failed to make me laugh. My deepest condolences to his family and friends.
RIP Sean Lock Forever rectum of the year
Sean Lock was a steady source of joy. Will be missed, heavily.
I'm heartbroken, RIP you mad lad!
The world is a little less funny.  Mores the pity we didn't see him Taskmaster.... imagine it.  Brilliant.
How heartbreaking. My deepest condolences to Sean's family and friends. 💔He was so funny on 8 out of 10 cats show. I will miss his humor. Prayers from Florida.🙏🙏
One of the all time greats, such an incredible shame. Rest easy Sean
This man.... this brilliant man, will be missed! Comedic genius.
RIP you brilliant bastard! I will miss him so much, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
It should've been Gemma. It should have been Gemma. The world is now darker, without Sean Lock.
I loved Sean, he was naturally funny, a true comedian.
Ready I'm peace Sean
From a fan who discovered Sean and his friends on panel shows via youtube.  He brought many an evening of joy to my life and am grateful to have found his work here.  He will be sorely missed.  Rest in peace you tosser
What a legend  Rest in Peace
Shit....just shit. RIP.
Devastating news. I have no words. We'll all miss this legend. Rest in peace Sean.
What a man.
Sean, you have brought so much laughter and happiness to our family over the years but especially during lockdown, thank you.  All our love to your family and friends. RIP.
Sean, I know you’ll not see this but wow where you a hero to me. Genuinely me of the funniest comedies in the uk, and you always will be. Thank you for making me laugh so much. Thoughts and prayers are with your family. Again Sean, that you so much.
I'm really grateful Sean to have seen you, the best. Thank you
RIP legend
Rest in peace! What an awesome comedian.
I couldn’t believe bbc news alert when it came through yesterday. Great loss to the world. My condolences to Sean’s family.
He was obviously unwell, so it isn't a huge surprise. However, he has been such an important member of Countdown that it will be tough to replace him. Along with David Mitchell and Sara Pascoe, my favourite QI lineup. Thanks for the laughs, Sean!
A shocking and tragic loss. RIP Sean Lock.
Rip
No way. I refuse to believe this. Please make me cry while laughing, Sean... please I need people like you
What a sweet and gentle soul we've lost.
Oh god. We're going to miss him.
my favourite comedian of all time, rest in peace my friend
I remember randomly wandering into 8 out of 10 cats during my dark last year of uni, and Sean Lock brought me so much joy and helped me go through all the tough time.   You will be dearly missed, Mr. Lock.
So terribly sad a loss, such a wonderful funny person whose wit and humour brightened the world. Rest in peace.
I was so sad to hear about his passing. Yet, thanks to the internet, I can still enjoy his skits for years to come. A great loss, won't be forgotten. Definitely not by me.
i never thought the untimely passing of a comedian would make me cry....how many stressful days were made better by Mr. Lock and his comrades on 8 out of 10.....
What a shock. Comedy and the Universe will miss you.  Thanks for the good times and rest peacefully.
That first clip was pure dedication to Sean. I almost teared up on how close that felt to praise and remembrance to himself.
A true legend will be missed
😢
With Sean lock now in a better place.. I have watched 8 out of 10 cats does countdown,QI. He was awesome and he made people smile and laugh. I will always remember 'carrot in the box'. R.I.P
Cancer can occur without symptoms and many die within weeks of diagnosis; RIP Sean.
A great big light has gone off in British comedy. I'm sad and gutted. RIP Sean, you funny, funny bastard.
Holy sh*tx is he dead? How and when?? Why don't you have more info Channel 4?!?!???
Undisputed Carrot in a Box Champion.
Till now I still cannot accept the fact that he has passed on. He is still so young, and he still feels so alive in my heart... 😔
Rest in Peace Sean Lock
This one hit me hard. RIP Sean 😢
Rip Sean you will truly be missed 🥺
RIP Sean, one very funny guy, who will be missed by millions.
One of our finest comics and one who will be solely missed.... Taken far too early, rest in peace Sean,  my thoughts and prayers are with your family.
VERY  FUNNY GUY ,, RIP SEAN 🙏
Thanks, Sean
One Hilarious Man! Thanks for the Laughs! RIP
Vale Sean
The Jab? No one else will ask.... May he RIP
He was brilliant, it takes a lot for me to truly like a celebrity. Sean was really easy to like, I find it hard to believe he’s gone such a tragedy. His poor family, I really feel for them, RIP Sean 😞
My absolute favourite comedian of all time. Got me through some tough times with his bizzare humour. I'll always be grateful for that. Rest in peace, legend ❤️
😭😭😭
American here. back around .... eesh, i dont even know, lemme say 2009-ish i discovered Big Fat Quiz of the Year on youtube. absolutely LOVED the 2006 quiz [?] with noel fielding and russell brand even tho i had no idea who they were really [cuz american]. kept watching those every new year and was really enjoying watching new celebs/guests from the other side of the 'pond'. a few years ago i started watching '8 out of 10 cats' and of course fell immediatly in love with rachael, roisin,  jimmie car [2 different kinds of love] but also really loved Sean. sean and miles jupp [?] was my fav team [as well as sean/roisin], really wish they had done many more episodes with those 2 together. my fav BFQOTY episodes were russell/noel and sean/corden. really wish they had sean on BFQOTY as a regular quest as well. there just wasnt enuf of him to go around maybe. he will be greatly  missed.
Rest In Peace to such a comedy icon! Sean will be missed
Absolutely heartbroken, the world lost an incredible talent.
This is was an absolute legend. His jokes were on another level. His standup, his humour, his vibes! He’ll be missed!!
Will the proceeds of this video go to his family? Seems immoral to try to profit off his death with this video
I'm gonna miss him.
You could have added not spitting on Miles Jupp and reanimating the Nazis too.
I had never heard of him previously but seeing this clip gave me an idea what he meant to others. RIP Mr. Rock
RIP Sean  My favourite comedian, and an all-round amazing person
Rest in peace Sean, I'm sure you'll be making them laugh wherever you are
R.I.P. Sean, You will be missed
🙏🙏
R.I.P. Sean Lock the King of Whelks!!!
Such a funny guy - you will be missed. RIP
Thankyou for your brilliant humour, it put me in hysterics.
🥺❤️
Thank you for the smiles and many laughs Sean. You'll be missed
R.I.P Sean, you made me laugh so much
He is going to be missed by millions
Goodbye grumpy old man. You'll be missed dearly 💛
Undisputed Carrot in a Box Champion. RIP Sean.
Genuinely devastated by this news, didn’t know it was possible to care for someone so dearly that you’d never even met. A loss to us all that it’ll take me some time to fully accept.
Sean brought a lot of joy into my home,  I thank him and his family for sharing his great talent with us all.  Bless you Sean. There are no words, so young. :(
Wow, just finding this out now through this vid as well. I thought it was just a tribute to Sean and didn't realise that he had passed away, very sad. I love his cheeky sense of humour and dry wit. His bit with Jon Richardson and the carrot in the box is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. RIP Sean, thanks for the laughs mate
RIP, Legend
A great Loss
That R.I.P at the end shocked me, I didn't know before that. God bless your beautiful soul. 😔♥️
Thanks for the laughs
The only way I'll ever be as funny as Sean Lock, is if I look in a mirror. RIP you absolute legend
I wouldn't have thought I would be sad about this, I binge him nearly every night and nothing but laughter watching the same clips over and over again. He will be missed 🥰  Thanks for always making me smile you fucking legend! ❤❤❤
Sean Lock was an absolute legend, RIP.
RIP
Milk milk lemonade, round the back chocolates made 😂
Absolutely devastated when the news broke. Sean was one of the funniest gentlemen around and I'll miss his bone dry sense of humour and fast wit. Rest in peace chap, rest in peace.
There was never a time where he failed to make me laugh. What a legend he was. He will be missed.
"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
His Nazi Island bit almost killed me. I was gasping for air when I saw that..
Someone who United people around the world bringing the gift of comedy. This Hit hard man. RIP :(
Rest in peace Sean ♥️
What did he die from?
Hello everyone I just wanted to let you know that God loves you and He is patiently waiting for you to submit to Him before it is too late we could die at any moment. I am so thankful because in my past, there were situations that happened to me that could have destroyed me forever and Jesus Christ saved me from it all. He made me realize that the way I was living and what I was being influenced by was only leading me to hell . I know for sure I am still here because of His mercy on my soul and His forgiveness, now I can help others get closer to Him. God so loved the world He gave His only begotten Son, I encourage you all today to repent of your sins, give your life fully to Jesus Christ He died for all of us, and turn away from sin the evil and idolatry of this world it will only lead you to hell and you do not want to go there. Make that decision right now while you still have time, follow The LORD in all that you do and keep His commandments always. You will not regret this decision because when it is all over your eternity will be final and forever. God bless you and your families please be safe and take care much love 💕
He *was* a sensation. Thank you for the tribute.
REal sad news Sean is still getting us thru hard times and will forever I reckon
Prayers from an American fan. His straight faced humor always had me going. Him and Jon going at it and always trying to push each other to comedic limits.🙏
Howling laughing the whole time. Forever the funniest guy in the room
One of the most genuinely funny people I have ever had the joy of watching. Cried from laughter many times watching Sean. Will be missed
So sorry to hear this..RIP Sean.
His quick wit and dry humour will always be missed. He was a true comedian the likes of which aren't there anymore in this increasingly PC world. ❤️
Was able to experience joy throughout so many tough times thanks to Sean. My all time favorite comedian by far. Thank you for everything and Rest In Peace.
A great man & funny fella. Will miss your wit Sean.
I just recently found these clips of 8/10 Cats, Countdown, etc and I've been absolutely dying in laughter.  Sucks to have just discovered Sean Lock and now he's gone. RIP
Ouch. My heart.
Life's not fair but at least you made it funny Sean. Too soon so sad
I wouldn't normally write on these things, but Sean came across as a really genuinely nice guy. I share a small portion of the pain being felt today. RIP
I was saddened by the news of his passing. I always enjoyed his comedy and his fast snap comebacks and his delivery always caught me off guard. Go on easy Mr Lock.  “I won’t spit on you when we are having sex tonight”. I lost track of time laughing at that over and over. If you know, ya know.
Will be sincerely missed. 😓
Mr BoJangles,,, the parasites are coming... Ledgend
Rest in piece Sean, you got me through many difficulties with your amazing humor <3 Keep living the dream champion :)
I can't believe it. RIP
Merry Christmas you pair of tossers....priceless! BEAMRULES
im so shocked about this, 8OO10CDC will never be the same
This breaks my heart, he just seemed like the man who would be around forever and now he is gone and it just feels like it isn’t real
Absolute comedy genius.   “That’s a challenging wank.” - Sean Lock
I love you Sean Lock, you've brought so much joy to us.Thank you for all the laughs,Rest in power,you absolute legend 😭
Gone too soon and will be missed and remembered as a superb addition to UK comedy. RIP Sean. Thank you for the laughs.
brought so many smiles to me at the worst of the times  may he rest in peace!
‘When he bent over, set the sprinklers off’
He got me through some of the worst and traumatic and painful times in my life. These people really do save lives. RIP 💛💛 grateful for such a beautiful soul to walk the earth
He was 58.  Fifty-fucking-Eight.  That's just not fair.
Woke up to see Carrot in a box trending. Thought to myself that’s odd. Then I saw the first tweet from Jon Richardson, I can’t believe it. I’m just an Aussie that watches eight out of ten cats does countdown nightly. Never knew Sean personally but the sadness today makes me feel like I did. My condolences to his wife and kids, if a man i never met could have such a profound effect on me, I can only imagine how the people that know him and love him must feel. RIP Mr Sean Lock.
I can't believe I didn't hear any coverage on this until I saw this video. The US has no idea what a huge loss this is. Sean Lock and all of the 8 Out of 10 Cats crew has helped me be happy through some dark times. Specifically countdown. I can't believe it.
❤️
Rest in peace Sean, from a portuguese fan who discovered your talent by pure chance. Lucky me. Thank you mr. Lock!!!
He was one, if not the only one, of the reasons I watched 8 out of 10 cats does countdown. A comedic genius, timing was perfect and his humour was utterly on my level. Gone too soon.
Don't think people realise the impact his humour had on people's lives!
Sean Lock’s coffin should have a carrot in it
Nothing beats coming home to a full mouse trap does it?
Too bad... I've enjoyed a lot of laughs at his wit. Hate news like this.
Rip
what an amazing man who will be sadly missed, goodbye sean rest in love and peace
Goodbye Sean
This is terrible news. One of my favourite comedians. His one liners and their delivery were unique and hilarious in equal measure. His wit was very natural and he didnt try too hard to be funny. A huge loss not only to this show but to comedy in general. May he RIP.
Many Sean Lock fans in the States.  Sad to hear the news.
Today world isn't a better place, my favourite of Sean's lines is, "I have voices in my head but I just ignore them and carry on killing".
Oh man, will he be missed. RIP
Rest in Peace to one of the funniest humans ever! You will be missed!!
Rest in peace. I don't know how many times buddy had me in tears i was laughing so hard.
He has left us far too soon. Rip.
To a great comedian....a dreadful loss to the world. Rest in Peace mate, have a can of water on me.
No no no no no no no no no
True comic talent,will never forget the 🥕 in a box game-genius. Always remembered....
The world is a lesser place.
This is the best way to remember him. The Good times he gave us.
A true national treasure no matter what I was feeling he always put a smile on my face I know but he want me to laugh at this compilation but all I can do is cry it was at least in my estimation dearly loved . Rest in peace Sean thank you for your talent and your presence
So terribly sad. Thanks for the laughs. Rest in Peace.
Rest In Peace Sean ❤️
Thank you for the laughter...
Such a sad day. He was truly one of the greats and game me and my friends so many laughs throuout the years. Thank you for all of it Sean.
Wow. This is rough. RIP my good fellow.
Rest In Peace to a true great, we will forever be grateful for the countless laughs you bought to us effortlessly. Never forgotten!
I can only imagine the jokes he's making about it now. rest in peace Sean <3
I’m an American. I only know Sean Lock from YouTube. I’m completely heartbroken for the loss of this charming man. I will miss him greatly, but I’m so glad we all have these videos to remember him by. My heart is with England, his family and friends, and cast of 8 Out of 10 for their terrible loss. ❤️
Rest in Peace Sean, what a great guy, we all already miss you
RIP Sean :(
*_These are complex tears... uncontrollable laughter followed by sympathy..._*
What the hell man, I’m too young for one of my favourite comedians to no longer be here. I was looking forward to years more of laughs. So sad, he was a legend.
I thought this was a joke when I saw someone made a memorandum for Sean Locke on YouTube today. Then I started seeing articles appear. Such an absolute shame. Rest In Peace Sean; thank you for making me love 8 out of 10 Cats (does Countdown).
Rectum of the Year was one of his best bits. Sad news.
Rest In Peace, we love you, Sean Lock!!! A brilliant comedian. 💕
This is simultaneously the best and worst way to learn this news
R I P the goat !!
My favorite Sean Lock memory is when Jon asked him how to pronounce schedule and he responded with, “I dunno, I don’t give a shit.” I’ll miss his simple, dry humour, it was simply the best!
As an American who love Sean Lock he will be incredibly missed. I watch A LOT of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown, and he is my favorite person.
I'm from the US and discovered Sean through a random episode of QI that I found on YT at least a decade ago. I'm not sure there's been a day since that I haven't watched at least a few minutes of him doing what he did so incredibly. Soar high on the wings of laughter, sir, and thanks for colouring my life so generously.
Goodbye Sean Lock. Thank you for all the years of laughter you have given us. Words truly cannot express who you were and what you mean to all of your fans.
"The best thing about being home alone?"  "Oh that's easy, using the litter tray"  Rest well, Sean
We all wanted to see him become the curmudgeonly old man he always pretended he was...
Always made me laugh, I will miss him dearly.
Rest Peacefully Sean Lock ✨🌟❤️
I am an American who mainly knows about Sean Lock because of videos here. And yet he quickly became one of my favorite comedians. RIP sir and condolences to his family.
He made it look ignorant, belligerent and predominantly male, but every gag was effortlessly timed and ingeniously executed.  A true legend and role mode who will be extremely missed
What the hell I just thought the title was in poor taste as a joke but he's actually passed I'm shocked!!
The world will never be as funny as it use to be... today just sucks 😭
The lines/bits from Sean on this show that stand out from the others is the carrot challenge with Richardson, his "Rectum of The Year" and his reply to Miles about Claude ( "I won't spit on you while we're having sex). Such sad, sad news. RIP Sean. 🙏
"Please stop" - Sean Lock  (banging the table and laughing at Wilkinson poem) Goodbye champ.
R I P,  such a funny man…I will continue watching him on the reruns! He brought so much laughter to people’s lives! You will be missed so very much Sean! 😢
I am heartbroken. I loved watching him. He was truly gifted and made me laugh so hard.
will be truly missed...such a brilliant comedian... Rest in Peace
its weird....the feeling of a comedian dying, it feels like this is just another one of his jokes and 2 weeks from now he'll go "AHHH I GOT YOU ALL" but knowing its real, knowing i will never see this comedian ever again on a new panel show, comedy show, anything is just a feeling of emptiness, rest in peace sean, clearly there will never be another extraordinary comic like you
Sean Locks greatest bit on Cats was Nazi Island... so funny. Sad thing is no more Carrot in a box...
I've never felt any way about a celeb passing until Sean died, I didn't know i could feel so sad about something like that, but I even cried RIP
Really sad day
😭
I have seen that word prediction clip at least 20 times and I crack up each time.
i'm not from the UK but the states i'm sorry to hear he passed away but i honestly i have never even heard of the guy before
Sad news, loved him from all the UK panel shows
He has brought me and so many other so much joy and laughter. He will be missed by a lot of people. My thoughts are with his family and friends now. R.i.p you legend! 💙
Rest in peace Sean 🇬🇧
This hit me harder than when Nigel from Gardeners world passed. ❤ I'm going to miss you Sean. You brought light into my life.
Sean lock has literally saved me more times than I can count, it broke me when I heard he died. Shouldn't have had his salad ciggies 😭
I’m going to miss his comedy!
I’m fucking gutted. I had no idea he was sick.
Sean Locke's comedy is all I had to lighten my days during my sting of homelessness after my abusive girlfriend absconded with my children and ruined my life. I'm happy and healthy with custody of my three children and I'm so sad for his family to lose such a positive person with all his unique wit. Shedding a tear or two writing this. Thankyou Sean for being there when no one else was, I'll appreciate Ur role in me pulling my life together forever. Thankyou and rest in peace my friend :'(
Amazing comedian, he brought me so many laughs. Rest In Peace.
You’ll be greatly missed Sean, rest easy 🤍🕊
I laughed so much I forgot for a minute that he's actually gone. RIP funny man. x
Joe Wilkinson's Poem should be on here as well, if only for Sean's reaction.
It's still hard to believe that Sean is actually gone. Anytime I had nothing to watch, I would watch 8 out of 10 cats does countdown and it always made me laugh. Sean and Jon's chemistry was unmatched, they worked so well together, even any teammate he had there was just a natural connection. I can't imagine how they're all feeling hearing this. Sean wanted to put a smile on everyone's face and he accomplished that no matter what. This is the time to look back at his work and cry of tears, both sad and laughter.   You will be missed dearly Sean, thank you for what you bought the world. The comedy scene will not be the same again.
Thanks for all the laughs Sean
The one comedian that wasn't afraid to offend as many people as possible.
Really shocked and feel genuinely upset hearing this news today. This video made me cry  I remember a "bit" that he did on something, some stand-up I think, talking about how he'd had skin cancer when working as a roofer or labourer, I'm sorry I don't remember the job exactly.  From what I recall he made light of it, told it with humour, it was a part of his show and delivered with typical Sean Lock style.  But I remember him saying about the situation, a "masculine environment"/macho culture in the workplace, and always working shirtless outdoors in the sun, and not wanting to ask the boss to rub some sun lotion on their backs etc, and you can't reach yourself so you don't bother, and as such how men are more likely to develop skin cancers on their backs.   I don't know what took him - too young.   I don't know if it was related to the above, but he brought that awareness to me that I didn't have before. And probably, hopefully to other people too, who might then have otherwise been affected by skin cancer.   But instead decided to always wear sunscreen
He went off to have his rematch with Maradona
An incredible man and comedian will be sadly missed
Stellar comedian. RIP.
In honor of Sean we should eat some pork in hopes of getting a tapeworm
Hopefully he gets his wish of his ashes being thrown in piers Morgan’s eyes
So bright, so brief. We loved him and always will.
This is a great shock - I saw this video title and had to chase up what had happened. Sean had such an effortless delivery for funny lines that came from so far left field that I used to think he had a time machine to go get them. He had so many of us in tears of laughter and I loved how he could outpace Jimmy Carr who is so fast himself.
He was so lovely.... RIP and laughter 💕
Sean Lock - undisputed "Carrot in a box" Champion forever.
Count less hours of laughter and enjoyment. You will be missed Sean...
Love the bit he did about bringing back the nazis.. the world is a little bit less funny with him gone. Very funny man.
There isn’t a joke he made I didn’t laugh at - rip sean and thanks
Shocked and gutted. Had me in tears on too many occasions. Brilliant chap. Rest well.
❤️❤️❤️
I want a 'One more appearance from Sean Lock' voucher!
This sensation/idea of a man, will be missed.
Thanks for all of the laughs.

One of a kind. RIP

I am shocked. Laughed my way through this video until I realised what was going on. Sean is one of my all-time favourites. I hope his ending was painless.
RIP Sean, you are a legend <3
Sean Lock drank water from a tall white can - before it was cool.
Nothing but love!!! RIP Sean.
RIP THE ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Gutted he is gone. Another legend RIP
R.I.P taken too soon
Unfucking believable! Too soon!
<3
The only way I can live with the fact he’s gone is pretend it hasn’t happened. That and watch everything he’s ever been in.
Taken from us far, far too soon. What an incredible comedian.
Thank you Sean <3
Thank you very much for the laughs Sean. You will be sadly missed. Rest In Peace mate. 🇦🇺

Sean Lock = Legend
an english legend from a irish follower
Very sad day..Sean was a brilliant comedian and a lovely guy,the comedy world has lost a diamond!
Such tragic news for his family and his fans🇨🇦
Sad news. I only discovered his genius a couple years ago. Bummer. R.I.P.
This is awful news. RIP, Sean. Your comedy was brilliant.
Legendary
yoou bastards. Have me crying like a bby.
RIP Sean. Watching cats does countdown and 8 out of 10 cats with you in it really got me through some weird shit in my life. Was always nice to see you pop up on QI too. You really are a legend, RIP!!
I discovered Countdown on YouTube about a year  ago and have been watching almost nightly .. was tuning in just now and saw this. This breaks my heart. RIP Sean.  Love to his family and friends from Houston Texas
💔
I watched over an hour of Sean yesterday before the news broke. A great loss to comedy.

I had no idea. I thought the title just meant he left the show biz. Oh my goodness. RIP, truly. Thank you for giving me happiness. You will be remembered.
I only learned of Sean’s passing because of this clip. Coming from Canada, may you Rest In Peace Sean.
Absolutely tragic
How can people dislike this video? Such disrespect.
He never lost his sense of humor throughout.
R.I.P SEAN LOCK MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT FROM NEW ZEALAND ❤❤❤
Prayer of comfort for your family and God Speed Sean. Thank you for the laughs.
Wow, I had no idea he was sick. RIP you fucking legend.
Never known someone to make Jimmy laugh as much as Sean
Rest in peace Sean 💔 You'll be so missed!
Sean (and Jon) got me into British chat shows with Cats Does Countdown.  The character that he played was hilarious, but it was also clear what a genuinely nice man he was.
A true man of the people and absolute legend. he will be missed.
A true national treasure
Oh man. This is too sad. I've been watching his compilations all week. RIP Sean. 😢
rest in peace he will be missed
Rip sean thanks for the laughs
Such sad news!💔💔
I love this man
So sad. Such a legend
This news came as an absolute shock to me. What a phenomenal man and comedian. He will be sorely missed, but at least we can still appreciate all of the laughs he's given us over the years.
RIP
Man.....gonna miss Sean.  Also he will always have a perfect record over Jon in 'Carrot in a box'
I am not Brittish and did not know who you were inti today, but I am sad to see you go. 58 is way to young for anyone to die. RIP
one of my top 3 favourite comedians of all time; maybe even the favourite. Absolutely gutted to hear that he's gone. Rest easy Sean, you're not suffering anymore.
RIP funny man
So very sad 😔
So truly devastating. Brought me tears of joy so many times. Sending love to anyone who's impacted by Sean's death right now.. 💖
These are great, but carrot in a box, absolutely brilliant
Sorry to see you go old mate!  RIP.
A great loss.  He was such a fanatic comedian.
Suffered a pretty long period of depression during the last sort of 6 years (gotten better), my heart will always go out to Sean for being able to put a smile on my face, no matter how impossible that felt at the time.
Rectum? Hell, he killed 'em!
why does jimmy laugh like those aliens in galaxy quest
An absolute comedy genius. They’ll never be another like him. R.I.P. Sir.
I'll miss Sean Lock so much, been watching him non stop the last couple years. Truly an amazing comedian and human being. RIP
Wtf? How? So sad :(
Tough one to take. Very funny, off-kilter, superb comedy. RIP.
My thoughts are with his friends and family. We lost an absolute legend, and he'll be sorely missed.
His comedie was so unique
Anytime someone tells me to get off their yard or when a see a whelk…I’ll think of Sean and smile.
He truly was the comedian for comedians
RIP Sean Lock - 2X Carrot in the Box winner, Rectum of the Year, so many wonderful achievements  and one of the very best in the biz
The full mouse trap will have to wait !
You brought me many laughs Mr. Lock RIP.
A legend who will forever be missed Suprised the who has carrot in the box skit wasn't included.
Rest in peace funny man. You've made me laugh many times and I think helped shape my own comedy styling. You'll be missed
The end of the clip when he reduced Claudia Winkleman to tears, that's the level of craft Sean Lock brings to the table.  Comedy genius.
Love you so much Sean. Rest in peace mate❤️
Class act
One of my favourite comics sad we lost him
It's amazing how hard the passing of someone you've not met can hit you.  This one was really hard.  Many nights have been filled watching the brilliance that will always be Sean Lock.
R.I.P Sean Lock thank you for all the laughs and bringing joy during some fairly dark times to many you will be sorely missed
My mind is blown. I didn’t know he had passed until this video!
I'd like to think that Sean is currently having a rectum of the year competition with Diego Maradona. RIP Sean
Thanks for all the laughter and smiles Mr Lock. You will be sorely missed.
An absolute legend of a comic. Unique style. Loved discovering him. Now he’s gone. RIP
Comedy genius.
I just saw his name in the recent deaths section of Wikipedia. I'm stunned. Huge loss for those of us whose lives were enriched by his comedy.
"If there isn't a carrot in there, you're a fucking Genius"  That whole section was sublime.
Wow..shocked to find this out as I'm watching this clip as I would regularly come back to have a laugh at Sean's genius,it was only with the obituary at the end that it dawned,absolutely gutted..just gutted,will be sorely missed Sean,rest in peace or raise hell
He was such a joy!!
The sad loss of a genuinely hilarious man. My heart goes out to his friends and family. 💕
What an absolute treasure of a man we lost today. This man could make me laugh like no one else could RIP.
Not sure whether to laugh or cry at this. RIP Sean.
Weirdly enough, my first thought when I heard this news last night was how will Jon Richardson cope? Can't imagine this show without Sean Lock, the strange and delightfully bitter grandfather figure we didn't know we needed until we lost him. May he float forever and irritably in Piers Morgan's eyeballs.
This man was and will always be gone of the best. RIP.
Being genuinely honest not many comedians make me laugh, let alone laugh almost every joke, this guy was a fucking legend and i hope you are welcomed in heaven with all the other legends, R.I.P Sean x
Are you fucking kidding? He passed away? Wtf, I only watched the episodes with both him and jon, I guess I won't be watching anymore :(
RIP Sean. You were a talented & incredibly funny man, and one of my favourite people on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown 😥My sincerest condolences to your family & friends. You will be missed greatly.
❤❤❤❤❤
Found Sean through browsing English comedy shows from YouTube... We will miss you Sean, love from Indonesia!
Sean made you laugh so hard you forgot yourself. I can picture him  grimacing at the very thought, but that’s generosity on a grand scale.  Thank-you, RIP
This is actually the saddest news 😭
Even in America we grieve for him.  RIP to one of my favorite comedians :(
I am so sad that this is...real. <3 What a lovely man we have lost <3
Thanks Sean, for all the laughs you gave me. A real tonic. Rest in peace.
RIP Sean …
Don’t be angry or sad he’s gone, be happy he left us a life of laughter to love.
58.. Dont know what to say. Fair well  Best thoughts to Family. Thanks for all the laughs!💐
Rip King 🙏
Tears are running down my face. I am broken hearted. So much humor, so funny, so witty. You will be remembered, my friend.
RiP 😢 "That's a challenging wank" is one of THE GREATEST lines in the history of comedy.
We never got to use the Rescind a Pensioners Bus Pass on him, what a play.  RIP Sean.
Was shocked by his passing, such a funny man 💔
How they only kept this to such a short clip he was one of the few that could match Jimmy Carr with a quick wit and joke surprised there was no clips with Harriet or Rosini in there as his interactions with them are hilarious
It's stunning to hear the passing of someone who gave me such great laughs and made some shitty days brighter than ever Rest in peace Sean lock
Well. That's a challenging wank.
BRUNCH BRUNCH BRUNCH BRUNCH BRUNCH BRUNCH
A wonderful comedian. I loved watching him, he had me crying with laughter every time! Thank you Sean!! You will be missed. R.I.P.
Thanks for so many laughs, Sean! R.I.P.
So so sad 😞 Genuinely one of the funniest people to have ever lived. My thoughts are with his family.
What kind of “cute” gives this a thumbs down?
I was so shocked seeing the horrible news this morning. A terrible loss. He's incredible, and just such a lovely soul. Rest in peace, Sean❤💔
The Beamrules card gag had me howling with laughter, such a brilliant gag. Rest in peace Sean, you will be very sadly missed 💔
Shame the Racist Rachael Riley is still breathing.
Legend
in Sean Lockdown here in NZ, woke this morning and you were dead - ate some whelks, scratched my head, I'll miss you so much mate, you were the best.
world carrot in a box champion undesputed you will be missed god speed good sir
To Sean Lockes's family...condolences to your loss...Sean was a hilarious man

Damn. RIP.
134 thumbs-down from RNLI members.
You will be surely missed Sean, and for you sake I really hope the headstone reads "NOOOOOOO WHHHHYYY"as per your wishes. Rest easy mate.
An artful and funny man. Will be forever missed.
made me laugh on days I didnt think possible. tragic loss. god bless.  :(
Say it Aint so! R.I.P Sean thank you for the Laughs!
"it's like putting a chefs hat on a walnut". Sean on Gordon Ramsay :( x
This news is heartbreaking…. This show and Sean in particular has kept me company for the 14 years of an expat life in taiwan…. I can’t believe it ….
Thanks for being you respect to his family
Those pair of tossers Brian & Margaret will miss their neighbour.
My love to you Sean. You were beyond the intellect
Still struggling to deal with this, he was simply the best. 8 out of 10 Cats will never be the same again. RIP Sean Lock.
RIP Sean, A Fan from Canada
A genius.
RIP Sean, thank you for the laughs
R.I.P Sean the comedy world won’t be the same
My favourite cats does countdown Sean Lock moment:  “I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex”   Miles Jupp “well good luck doing it without spit”
Being in America, I just discovered all this brilliant British comedy this year...I now have a playlist with 163 videos on it that I watch some of almost daily, and the majority of the videos have Sean in them....I'm gonna miss that grumpy tosspot...
Really sad to hear the passing of Sean, enjoyed his comedy.
Heartbreaking news this morning. A brilliant comedian and from the tributes also a great human being.
I had only just gotten into 8OO10CDC earlier this year, so I had only just become used to seeing Sean and his sense of humour. It feels surreal to have come to "know" someone over the course of just a few months and then learn of their loss. My condolences to everyone who had him as a part of their lives. The man was a riot. Hope he's off making his Nazi Island show now.
This guy was the best. I feel like I’ve lost a mate. They say that  laughter is the best medicine, well Sean must’ve made a lot of people feel better. What a loss! Thinking of those that knew and loved him.
Legend lost
May Sean Lock rest in Peace <3
Gone too soon.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
What the fuck?! Just learned from this video that he died!? Condolences from a Dutch fan.
Love the guy 😭
RIP ❤❤❤
This guy always made me laugh. Very sad he's gone.
Gutted , RIP Sean
Truly one of the greatest! Created happiness where there wasn’t any and allowed many of us to find a place in this world through his joke. Will surely be missed.
😭... I loved Sean on 8oo10c.... It's only appropriate that Jon Richardson leave a carrot in a box at the graveside in Sean's honor... He'd want it that way I think.
RIP.
I still can't believe he's gone. The world has lost such an incredible person. RIP Sean, I hope you're at peace now.
RIP Sean. You were hilarious and made this show a must watch for me over the last couple of years.
what a great loss for comedy...sad day
I watch your show from Canada on YouTube. It was a great disappointment to find out Sean Lock has passed. My condolences.
😢
Such a funny dude. Will be missed
One of the greatest
I’m heartbroken with this news.He had such a positive impact to me when I was down and will remain my favourite comedian. Condolences to the finally and friends to this amazing man. Rest east Sean lock ❤️❤️
One of the greatest of all time. Thank you sean
this is a horrible birthday present
we'll never get a carrot in the box episode again.... this is a sad day
Terribly sad to hear of Sean’s passing, a great talent, naturally very funny in his ideas and delivery. Biggest compliment you can pay a comedian is them being funny without really trying. That was Sean Lock. He will be sorely missed, rest easy 😔
RIP😭😭😭
Thank you for the belly laughs. Rest in peace
He gets to keep the carrot now, Vale Sean
That's a challenging wank.
He brought so much joy to everyone.  He will be missed. RIP Sean 💔
Sad to lose this comic genius. If you want to get a tapeworm, eat some pork. Google can go fuck itself.
"Brian and Margaret have got a card with beamrules written on it" 😂😂 that was perfect planning👌🏼
Goddamn... feelings from Brazil, Sean. Thanks for all the laughs
This Tribute should be 10 hours long
:'(
Gent.
RIP Sean, you were an absolute comic genius.
We'll miss your incredible spirit, Sean. Keep them laughing up there too. May God bless and keep you.
i really hope his family can see these comments and the amount of love everyone felt for him. he brought so many laughs and smiles to everyone and that’s genuinely something to be proud of
Bye Sean 🙏
Went from laughing my head off at a Greg Davies show to utter devastation when I saw a comment saying "RIP Sean Lock." Couldn't believe my eyes. Thanks for all the laughs, Sean. You never failed to get me laughing, even when I was at my absolute lowest.
Carrot in a box god
He made me laugh, he made me smile, he made me happy.
<3
:(
This world sucks. It’s only the people that make us realize how much it sucks to have people die that make this whole thing suck less, they make it blow up to greatness.  Thanks for the suck mate, and thanks for the blow.
I don't cry often, but this did it. RIP Sean. Thank you for the laughs.
When I clicked on this I thought he retired, unfortunately that assumption was wrong. He always had the best obscene jokes. I Hope the best for his loved ones.
The Beamrules gag is my favourite of all time. So good. RIP Sean. You'll be sorely missed.
I'm brokenhearted. In my mind, Sean's Obituary reads "Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo..." like he joked, once. 8 Out of 10 Cats is down a lion. Rest in peace, Sean. And, thank you from the US.
Devastated to hear about the passing of the undefeated Carrot In A Box champion.  Rest in peace.
RIP
Just found out he died today he was such a good comedian I watched almost every episode of countdown and 8 out of 10 cats he was genuinely a funny man can’t believe he’s now gone   R.I.P Sean Lock
i was praying this was just a poorly titled video. i was wrong. now i have to go cry.
I've read many comments about Sean today and didn't see one bad one, a man universally loved and respected and wow what a talent..RIP Mr Lock...
The Tiger Who Came For a Pint.
Beamrules
so sad , another legend gone
RIP Locky Lad - you will be missed
RIP Sean Lock. you were a great man and a terrible loss to the comedy world. My condolences to his family and friends.
Rip
The last time I woke up literally to find my one favourite of my celebrity’s had died, was around last year when Chadwick Boseman died, sad to happen around a year later that another favourite celebrity of mine has pasted, Rest well Sean, you where a true comic and outstanding bloke
Oh no. He cracked me up every show.
I always looked forward to watching this show knowing that Sean Lock would make me laugh saying random weird stuff 😆 Rest in Peace
He will be missed. One of my absolute favourite comedians, rest in peace 🌹
Always got comfort from being able to get home from a rough day and watch sean locks genius and witness his incredible humour. I feel empty and lost knowing ur not here anymore.
A painfully funny man, upon seeing him in the two episode series "Sean and Jon Go West" a few years ago, clearly an honorable man, not frightened but intrigued by cultural differences. I think I speak for every fan of Sean Lock's in America how sad we are to hear of his passing. Like every great comic we've ever lost, the world has become just a little bit dimmer. RIP Mr. Lock  - Buffalo, New York
Never forget seeing him live at the city hall in Newcastle. My then girlfriend had convinced me to go and I was a fan from that day on.
Here’s hoping that when he took his first step into heaven, he found a full mouse trap
Legend and joy.
This was a challenging wank
this hit me hard. i'm thinking of his children. thank you for the laughs, sean.
Sean Lock was Total Comedy R.I.P. Darcy Wimballs ❤
RIP Sean Lock. The world will miss you and your humour.
Like every other video of his, I laughed to the end of this video too only then realized again that he is gone. RIP Mr. Lock, I'll never forget all the laughters and this deep sadness that you brought.
I’d often listen to compilations of Sean’s best bits when I needed help falling asleep. Not because it was boring, but because he was one of the few comedians who I found pleasure in listening to. His grumpiness brought me such joy.
The man was a cut above most comedians!  Any time I felt like a laugh Sean lock 8 out of 10 cats would cheer me up...... Rip 🤘😢🤘
Never failed to make me laugh...Rest in Peace, Sean Lock.
not to be disrespectful but i cant help but feel this is his greatest prank yet
So funny and so missed.
🥺
Much love from Ireland 🇮🇪 you made us Paddy's laugh everytime 💚
One of the greatest, without having to be nice because he's dead.
Love you Sean!! Rest In Peace!!
RIP.  Great man
A few months ago I realised that one day I would be old enough to see Sean lock die. Pretty sad thought but I thought iv got years till that will happen. What a Fucking year. What a Fucking hero.
The mayor of fun. There will never be one quite like him ever again.   RIP Sean Lock
Wait what? What happened???
I can't believe he's gone. I didn't realise he was my favoruite comedian until now.
Sad news, thanks for sharing.
Honestly gutted that this blokes gone couldn’t tell you how many times the guy had me in stitches since I was in my teens such a funny guy and a good man. RIP king 👑
I'm going to have a pint of Water in his honor. RIP Sean.
Oh man. Though we never met. I'm going to miss you mate.
I miss him already. I loved the mad genius.
Wow, truly one of the best comedians in the world. This is a hard one to digest, did not expect him to go suddenly.
Clever and hysterical and how I am going to miss Sean Lock and his wit and silliness and acerbic joy.  Lovely man, thank you for all the laughs.  You, Sir, shall always be a LEGEND.
goint to miss your humour as i started to build the island and clone the top nazi members.
2021 really sucks
This is seriously tough to take! One of the funniest British comedians to ever grace our TV screens! A legend taken far too soon.
So many laughs. Thank you Sean. Best one-liner for me was his "That's a challenging wank" comment. I nearly hurt myself laughing.
I hope he's on an island somewhere right now, fishing with Hitler and Goebbels
Rest in peace, Sean! You've brought me much laughter over the years. You will be dearly missed.
I am American and came across 8 out of 10 cats a few years ago. I am sure glad that I did. Sean Lock was my favorite on the show. May he R.I.P.
RIP Sean, thank you for blessing us with your humor
Sean's comedy style is unparalleled. As an American, I was lucky enough to come across clips of this show and immediately fell in love with his humor. Reading about his passing when I woke up today was an incredible punch to the gut. RIP, Sean. Thanks for making me and the rest of the world laugh when we really needed it.
Frikin hell, I remembered first discovering Sean during quarantine while browsing Youtube recommendations and just instantly characterizing British Comedy to him. For me he was a prime example of what British Comedy is because of how bloody good he is, how his delivery to every joke was witty and smart, and the best moments of him is when he loses it and breaks down during extremely funny skits. All the love from Indonesia, sucks to never get the chance to meet you. RIP Sean, what a legend.
Vale Sean Lock - thanks for giving me so many belly laughs and joy over the years.
Claudia Winklemann crying, Begging him to stop talking...Very Sadly, he has. RIP Sean.
Oh no, how sad. Too soon. RIP Sean.
What I love, and why I think he was so good, was the way all the other comedians were left in stitches.  In other examples, you can see that they have no idea where he is going or what he is doing, but they are in stitches anyway.
He made me laugh until I ached.
RIP funny man, rest easy now 👑
What an absolutely brilliant human he was. RIP Sean, I bet God is laughing his tits off tonight, you funny funny man.
Still unbelievable. RIP :(
The way talks make everything and ANYthing he says even funnier
no........
RIP you very, very funny man.
Rip to the world's silver rectum medalist
RIP my main main Locke. Ive lived out of the UK for years now but lways followed his comedy. The weird and grim way he made everything into a working class joke was always top notch. Saw on reddit today that he died. I'm genuienly sad. What a legend. at least he died with his loved ones at his side. Anyway, got to go and cry a bit.... maybe alot...
"coming home to a full mouse trap"... That's certainly beautiful.
I am an American who happens to love British telly more than anything else on the screen today. I adored Sean as a comedic icon on 8 Out of 10 Cats and 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and all the other numerous shows he has appeared on. I was so shocked and heartbroken when I found out why Sean had made the news today. He was a gem. I will miss hearing is jokes. I hope he has plenty of material for Heaven.
He made me us cry with laughter for years and now the laughter will always be filled with tears. RIP Sean you were a comedy genius and prayers to your family and friends . <3 x
Rip
absolute class act, will be missed RIP.
"NOOOOO.  WHHHHYYYYY." - as requested by Sean Lock, his obituary.
And the world is - again - getting darker... See you beyond.
Vale, Sean, you funny bastard! Thanks for all the laughs. You were one funny fucker.  And, yes, it was a challenging wank, but we all got there in the end.
Sean never liked Countdown...   lol Thanks Sean, for all the laughs - honestly, you have had me in tears of laughter many, many times.
So sad
R.I.P to an amazing comedian! One of the best, he will be hugely missed! A Great British comic, R.I.P purple van man
Hello everyone. As an American in the Midwest I watched this show on YouTube from time to time. He was super funny and I sincerely enjoyed his humor. RIP and best wishes to his family and friends.
As a California American I really enjoyed his sense of humor...May he rest in peace....
So talented. Such a loss.
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
One of the few comedians I could recall by name. RIP
Best line ever was to Rachel in a skin tight dress, a beard and viking helmet... "That's a challenging wank."
Gotta say, this video was a challenging wank
i live in canada, so i found out when i woke up in the morning. i just burst into tears. his name will forever be etched in the stone of comedy.
I really thought that “RIP Sean Lock”, was the name of his new comedy tour……..I’m gutted to find out he actually passed away!  Nooooooooooooo, whyyyyyyyyyyyyy, nooooooooooooo, argh!!
Nick helm sung a song called I hate cancer in the programme uncle   I've never lost anyone from cancer until now  I've lost the man who made me laugh out loud more than I ever have done   RIP sean I love you
Sorry for y'alls loss
Sean will be missed one of the funniest people Ive seen
I've no words so fast rip Shawn Lock
Sean is one of the greatest comics I have seen. And that is not hyperbolic. Many of us will miss his wit and comic relief 😔♥️
What a wonderful man a true great and will be sadly missed by everybody and definitely including me thank you for the memories brother rest in peace we will see you again 💔💔💔💔 xx
RIP Sean🥲❤️
RIP
R.I.P. and love to Sean Lock & family from Canada.
The world will have to find another "funniest person in the world". Thank you Sean for so many years of laughter. RIP.
Wow. I am so sorry about losing him. I wish his family and friends the best and hope they get through their period of grief as smoothly as possible. I enjoyed his appearances on the English panel shows I've been watching over the years. My favorite will always be when he beat Jon in the Carrot in a Box game. That and when he referred to \Rachel as a difficult wank, when she had her beard and Viking disguise on. RIP Sean, you will be missed.
No reason to watch panel shows anymore
RIP!
Rest in peace, Cheeky chappie
The undisputed, undefeated Carrot In A Box champion. An absolute legend of comedy who will be greatly missed.
The world just got a little bit darker. No other comic has ever made me cry laughing so much.
What a comedy legend. RIP Sean.
Sean Lock, RIP from a fan in Canada.  We do not really understand how we touch the world.
He’s dead wtfff
Condolences to family and friends from a New Zealand fan.
Really gonna miss him.
Anyone else laughing and sobbing simultaneously?
Rachel Riley reading that card is all of us anytime we heard Sean speak. Absolutely cackling and breaking down in laughter, almost in tears. Rest In Peace, Sean Lock.
This is a challenging wank
Such a huge loss.  He is like no other comic I know.  His laughs either were so obvious where his continued commitment just kept making it funnier or so obscure that once you figured out where he took it you were just delighted.
One true British funny guy, thank you for the tears of laughter over the years, now tears of saddness.
I only just started watching him on tv a few weeks ago & fell in love with his humour. He’ll be so missed. Such a shame that all his future jokes won’t be heard.
Absolute legend. One of the funniest people of all time to ever be on tv.
That's very sad news. I love Sean's comedy. It won't be the same without him. Love to his family.
Rip 👑
So sad to hear.  Cannot count how many times he had me rolling.
A comic genius, a father, a cancer survivor, an enigma who brought joy to others simply by being himself. Always treasured, never forgotten. Rest in peace
Legend!
Rip Sean, you will be missed
Not fair.
Sean had a particular style... R.I.P!
I reject your reality and substitute my own, where he is not dead... He cannot be dead ffs... My life feels empty... More than before...
The bit with him lying about the carrot needed to be included. Also since I’m American this is how I found out and I’m so sorry to hear it.   10/10 person
Amazing comedian, champion at Carrot in the box, You will be missed ❤ "You can't write tears Jimmy" 😢
Old school funny.. Rip sean..
RIP Sean, but on a positive note, congrats on never letting Jon get the carrot.
2-time champion of Carrot in a Box and creator of Nazi Island. You will be dearly missed 😔
Got told by family member oh some comedian you like passed today... Genuinely had tears when found it was Sean... Condolences to family and friend... this guy was a legend who made me laugh so many times and gone well before his time... One that made me laugh was when he joked about how he got his children to bed - Mr Jangles... and of course the challenging time with Rachel on 8 out of 10 Cats when she dressed as Viking with beard to go skiing... LOL... RIP Sean you legend...Thanks for the laughs and you will live on in our memories and probably DAVE...
Claudia losing her shit & begging him to stop talking was one of his great Cats moments , now I'm gonna be miserable all day . Didn't see this coming , RIP Sean .
6 mins isn't enough man... I could watch him for hours
Hot tarmac and a vets flannel. Thanks for all the belly laughs and showing all of us a different way of seeing the wold. RIP Sean.
Gone too soon!!  Will miss his humor!!!  RIP Sean!!!
Rest in peace Sean, a true British comedy genius.
Hi humour will be sorely missed.  Genuine brilliance.
What a huge loss to the world, we'll miss him
His jokes will never get old. RIP
Sean is/was genuinely my idol. Even though we may have seen it coming 'eventually', it feels so sudden and im shocked and so incredibly sad to have heard this news - I still can't wrap my head around it.  RIP, you bloody legend. We'll miss you, but may your legacy of laughter and smiles outlive us all. 💜
The world's great fanny magnet will always be remembered. So sad 😟. Best wishes to your family, friends, loved ones and fans.
Bless this man. He has been referred to as the comedian's comedian, and rightly so. Anything Sean was on was worth watching, he was unique. He'll be missed but treasured forever.
I’m so thankful for having the opportunity to see Sean live here in Norway a few years back. I am truly heartbroken that he is no longer with us. Thanks for making me laugh thru thick and thin Sean, you will forever be in my heart and be my favorite comic that I ever saw.  Rest In Peace🕊
It’s sad hearing some clips where you can tell that he was getting sicker behind the scenes in his voice and face. Rest in Peace Sean Lock, we miss you.
Always remember, when it comes to Sean Lock...  He won't spit on you when you're having sex tonight.
Honestly gutted rip Sean lock what a funny guy just did not care
I still couldn’t believe this is actually happening.
God bless you Sean, you've made me cry no end of times (only today, it's not with laughter) 💔💔💔💔
Awful to hear. Now THAT is a challenging wank!!
Legend. So many classic moments. ‘Carrot in a box’ had me on the floor. A Brilliant wit
Sean Lock, an incredible comedian, and a better man. Rest in peace, my friend. You will be missed.
Another incredibly funny man taken from us  RIP sean thank you for all the funny moments you gave us  best wishes to your family  8 out of 10 cats wont be the same without you  gone but never forgotten
I am heartbroken 🥺 i will never forget a carrot in a box. He seemed like a lovely man to be around. Rest in peace you legend
Loved Sean, genius, Friday 8 out of 10 cats will never be the same, too soon, Rest In Peace, condolences to the family for your untimely loss, God Bless
Never thought I wake up to a message from my friend saying the great Sean Lock has passed from Cancer. Genuinely speechless.
He was in a league of his own. It hurts so bad because he was so good. He'll be remembered forever.
Vale the fabulously funny Sean - gone too soon.  8 our of 10 cats will never been the same.
Just learned of this. Another One of a Kind has left us too soon. RIP Sean. From an American Brother. 🍻
Much love from a fan in Canada. I laugh along with Sean and his cohorts every night after work and it helps me to feel better, without fail, every time. I will miss his comedy.
I cried today and then watched clips of him to cheer me up again. Thank you Sean for all of the laughs over the years 😪😪
Sean encapsulated the British sense of humour. Not the pc garbage that is forced down our throats. Genuinely funny funny man. Rest in peace mate..!
Nooooooooo
Cheers back to you Sean. You will live on in the Annals of YouTube for a VERY long long time. Maybe not in Presence on this Planet but will definitely live on in the Annals of comedy History. Sad to hear of Sean's Passing. REST IN PEACE AS YOUR COMEDY WILL HAVE US IN PIECES.....🙏🙏🙏🙏
R.i.p you will be greatly missed
Noooooooooooo! Ayyyyyyyyyyy! NOOOOOOOOO! AYYYYYYYYYY!
What a guy, full of fun and laughter and sadly missed. Rest in peace
So sorry to hear this. 😔
Some of my favorite Sean Lock moments not included here:  Telling a disguised Rachel "That's a challenging wank."  Beating Jon twice in Carrot in a Box.  And his song about How to get a Tapeworm from Pork is just chef's kiss funny.  From the States, thanks for helping me learn British comedy. Rest in Peace.
I discovered Sean Lock in the last few years and he quickly became one of my favorite comedians, rest easy natty rebel
RIP mate you will be missed
So shocked and shattered about this... honestly a treasure to entertainment. Thanks for the memories :)
They always go in threes, don’t they? So we had Una Stubbs the other day, now Sean. I reckon the other one is going to be Bob Carolgees.
RIP Bloke. So many laughs  From jokes delivered with impeccable timing...
He made me laugh too many times to count. RIP Sean.
I always watch the best bits of 8 out 10 cats does countdown on YouTube and love the dryness and quick replies even though I re watch them I still find him hilarious...he was great in a team and fab by himself - we have lost a great talent...
His laugh was the best
Rip to a real comedians comedian
rest in peace sean lock, one of the funniest to ever do it!
An absolute legend… RIP Sean. Comedy TV won’t be the same without u 😢
Claudia wankleman has to be most ungenuine creature on TV.
Such a loss
RIP LEGEND!!!! <3
I had no idea. This sucks. Of all the people, why Sean? If we needed evidence life isn't fair, there you go.
Do you think if we all refuse to believe this he will still be alive :-(
I love Sean’s humour so much and appreciated the laughter he gave me with his presence on the TV screen. We’ve lost an incredible comedian with such a witty mind. I can only hope he inspires many others to become comedians and create much needed stand ups and content that we use to cheer ourselves up when we just need to smile and have a laugh. Sad to hear of your passing Sean, RIP Sean. You will be greatly missed.
Proper f*cking weirdo for disliking this video, what a man
He provided so many hysterical teary eyed laughs for me and my wife every Friday watching 8 Out of 10 Cats does Countdown with a beer. It's impossible to forget someone who had that effect on you. He encapsulated the best aspects of British comedy. There is a deep void now due to his loss. Thanks for all the joy you gave everyone Sean.
Carrot in a box will never be the same now it means more, rip Sean
Keanu reeves said that when we die,  "the ones that love us will miss us". You were loved
Damn, y'all will really dislike anything won't you?
Aloha and Mahalo Mr. Lock.
The best comedian to ever do it.  We love and miss you already, Sean. Rest In Peace.
Rest in peace to one of the greatest comedians ever to make this world laugh
Sean Lock was super cool.  Why somebody would come here & thumb down this video is very scary.
How can 123 people dislike the passing of a comedy genius. You will be missed by those that got your humour. RIP Sean.
Hard to believe.  He brought a lot of laughter to the world.
Oh my goodness, when did this happen :(:(:(:(
Loved this man's comedy.  thanks for all the laughs rip.
I just started watching countdown a few months ago, he was my favorite. Rip
Frankie Boyle was the reason I watched Mock The Week. Sean Lock was the reason I watched 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown. The world is a poorer place, now.
One of the funniest guys I've ever seen perform! He will be very sadly missed. A small consolation for his family might be to know that for decades to come, people will still be laughing at his performances. RIP Sean.
Rest in peace, Sean. You were a rare stock
Comic legend! I hope he has a carrot in his box 💙
❤❤
Was very sad to learn that Sean had passed away. Only recently discovered him, as well. Very funny man.
its really hard to write a memorial to someone that just makes you laugh, no matter the serious subject he had something...will be missed. going seal clubbing
RIP Sean.  One of the greatest comedians I've ever watched.
THAT'S GOOD MEAD
First Trevor Moore and now Sean Lock, bad couple of days.
Goddammit. What a loss to us all....
What an amazing comedian, still can’t believe the news and am still struggling to get my head around it. Rest in peace Sean Lock 🙌
Grateful for the laughs. I'll miss you!
Him mentioning maradona at the end was quite funny and sad knowing that both are no longer with us but now in a more peaceful place😢RIP❤️♥️
Beamrules. Whaaaat.... Sean Lock the best of the best. 💜💜💜💜
RIP LEGEND
With all that is going on in the world today, it is still an infinitely sadder place without Sean Lock in it.....
RIP Sean, you were always funny.
Heartbroken to hear this. Thank you Sean Locke. Rest in peace.
Your zany humour got me through some dark times and gave me the confidence to be myself. Rest in peace Sean.
We should all eat some whelks in honour of the great Sean Lock. He'll be missed greatly! My thoughts and love with his family and those closest to him! ❤️
So heart breaking! it’s not fair.
I was alright till the end….. then the picture of Sean😢 r.i.p you absolute legend
Thanks for all the laughs! Personally, I like to think you're up there, playing carrot in the box with god... and winning! RIP
I hope Sean knew how much he was admired and loved around the world. RIP from a big fan in NZ xx
Don't think 8 out of 10 cats would be the same without him still one of the best jokes came from him when betting for claude the stuffed animal (ferret) I think R.I.P Sean
Gone too soon as always, the world sucks! 😢
RIP, Sean.
Carrot in a box will go down as one of the best moments in television history. All thanks to John Locke, the most quick witted and naturally funny comedian England has seen
RIP Mr Jangles :(
I did not find him funny however either is cancer, I just hope he has found some peace. RIP
The world has lost a lgend.
I’ll always wish I could have gone seal clubbing with him 😢
My heart goes out to Sean's wife and children and second wife, Miles Jupp.
Lovely man and a very clever and witty comedian, he won't be forgotten.
R.i.p Mr lock The British people will miss you dearly fella  Naughty funny fucker !
Too sad
The rectum of the year bit had me crying. such a loss. great comedian.
A very very sad loss to British comedy, his dry humour was unmatched , the tiger comes for a pint is a classic, one of the very few that could out wit Jimmy Carr 😂😂😂
Honestly, that has made me cry... He is one of my favourite comedians and I will always come back to those moments. Great compilation. Love it
Rip you beautiful man
Heard about this at work, we were all shocked that he died, it was really upsetting because comedy is something I can bond with my uncle over, especially Sean. I'm sure we will all miss him but I'm glad we have this so we can cry with laughter again too
"What would you like written for your obituary, Sean?"  "Urgh, I dunno, I'll be dead"
RIP
Rest in peace Sean, sad news
A big regret will be that I never was able to go see a live show of his, I wish I'd had even met him, he always seemed to be such a creative person, I'm sure he wants people to keep enjoying his work and carry on laughing, thoughts are with his family ❤️
I watched that vid and tears are coming out of my eyes. Tears of laughter. Is that not the biggest irony of all. I will miss you Sean. But I'll remember you with laughter.
Brilliant man… 🙏🏽
Comedy has lost another one of the greats!
RIP Sean lock, wake up among the stars.
Absolute legend-
A great loss.
One of the greats has left us... a huge loss! I can’t believe how heartbroken I feel. He has given me so many moments of joy. Thank you so much.
💔
Celebrity crush no. 1 Rectum of the year Pure fucking genius
I don't know what to say. I loved the crusty persona and the humour.  I will miss watching him. My deepest condolences to his family and friends.  Rest in peace.
One of the greatest comedians to ever do it
First I knew. What a sad day. He was one of the funniest men I’ve ever seen. RIP Sean, we’re all going to miss you
Long live the King. One of the biggest regrets in my life is never getting to see him live 😫💦
One Of The Funniest. RIP X
I haven't watched tv for a long time now and I'm genuinely happy to see Sean Lock getting all this love. I always thought he was criminally under rated so it's a nice surprise to see. BBC ought to show 15 Stories High season 1 and 2 on a loop for a week out of respect
Terrible news. As an American that came to know 8 Out Of 10 Cats and …Does Countdown through YouTube, I’ve turned many friends onto those shows. The biggest hit (and my favorite) was Sean. My go-to introductory clip involved four simple words from Sean, and it left everyone in hysterics: “that’s a challenging wank.” Thank you for the laughs, sir. Rest In Peace.
Absolute star of that show, no question
Beautiful sense of humour. Will miss him a lot
Rip
The Gospel of Salvation/Warnings  JESUS CHRIST is the only Lord and Savior this whole creation needs. Please turn to Jesus Christ and get saved now while his grace is still merciful for he is coming soon!   John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life”.  Isaiah 45:18 “For this is what the Lord says— he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited he says: “I am the Lord,     and there is no other”.   Deuteronomy 32:39 “See now that I myself am he!     There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life,     I have wounded and I will heal,     and no one can deliver out of my hand”.   Philippians 2:8-11 “And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”.   JESUS CHRIST WAS GOD IN THE FLESH; Son of God.   John 1:1-5 “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it”.  John 1:14  “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth”.   How to get SALVATION (be saved):  1. Admit that you are a sinner. Romans 3:32   “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God”.  Romans 6:23  “For the wages of sin is death”.  2. Believe that Jesus paid for your sin at the cross. Romans 5:8  “But God demonstrates His own love for us: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us”.  Romans 6:23  “but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus”.  Ephesians 2:8-9 “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”   3. Confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and commit your life to him.  Romans 10:9  “That if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved”.    4. Repent (What does repent mean and do? To repent is a change of mind, that leads to a change of heart, that leads to a change in actions. This “change” involves both a turning from sin and a turning to God.) Luke 13:3  “But unless you repent, you too will all perish”.  Acts 3:19  “Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord”.  2 Peter 3:9  “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance”.   Once you come to Salvation then comes baptism. (Baptism is an act in which symbolizes one’s renewal/purification and becomes a child of God with the power of the Holy Spirit through water, whether the water is poured on to the forehead or one’s body is immersed into it. This symbolizes the death of our flesh with Christ and our new life through Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit.)  Acts 2:38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.”  Galatians 2:20  “ I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”  Galatians 3:26-27 “So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.”  1 Peter 3:21  “And this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”  WARNINGS!!! Anyone who does not have Jesus Christ will always be condemned and their righteous deeds are like filthy rags.   Romans 1:8 “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit”.  Isaiah 64:6 “All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away”.   Do not worship/sacrifice to other gods; you will only bring harm to yourself.  Jeremiah 25:6 “and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm”.   Deuteronomy 8:19  “It shall come about if you ever forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish”.  1 Corinthians 10:20  “No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons”.   TAKE HEED NOW!!! Jesus Christ wants you to have a personal relationship with him. He cares and loves you more than his own life that he gave it up for you to be saved. Jesus Christ is the ultimate sacrifice for all mankind; to atoned away all of our sins with his precious life and blood, that we may share in his Kingdom (1 John 2:2 “He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world”).  Jesus Christ is not about being religious but to be in unity with him and allow him to deliver you from the bondage that this sinful body (flesh) is doomed for; eternal hell (John 3:36 “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him”).  Only through Jesus Christ will you ever get to heaven (John 10:9 “I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture”). Seek Jesus Christ only: no other gods can save you from God’s wrath. God’s wrath is not a joke or to be taken lightly (Hebrews 10:31 “It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God”). Remember he is our Creator and all things are possible with him (Matthew 19:26).   May God bless you and soften your heart to discern the truth that is in Christ Jesus, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings; the Savior of this world.
Got me through some hard times, RIP to one of the funniest people ever
"Or that time i went seal clubbing. They said they hadn't seen anything like it, it was like a trolley dash. I had 2 hammers, i was doing 4 at once" RIP Legend
What a gift he had.
Couldn't believe my eyes when I read the news this morning. I had no idea he was ill but I guess most of us didn't. One of the funniest and smartest guys on tv. Rapier wit. I didn't know him of course but the cast of 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown must be devastated.
I never watched 8 out of Ten Cats because I detest Jimmy Carr...but always loved Sean & his unique style, especially his stand up. RIP
Genuinely couldn't believe the news. Absolutely heartbreaking for his family and kids. Now he's eating welks in heaven. Rest in Power you prince
R.I.P Sean one of our best xx❤
The saddest part is he'll never know how much he meant to all of us. Whenever we were down we could rely on him to make us cry with laughter.  Thank you Sean, We miss you dearly.
I've only cried at the news of a celebrity death twice before today; when Robin Williams passed, and when David Bowie passed.  That is the type of legend I have seen from Sean Lock since I discovered 8 out of 10 Cats (and Countdown).  Much love to you, Sean!
Rest in peace, Sean. You will be sorely missed.
LEGEND! Thank you for the 100's of hours of entertainment and laughter.
So saddened by his death. Endless hours not only watching him but searching his skits and greatest moments for a good laugh and real humour.   RIP legend
RIP
Rip Sean :)
When I first heard, I was devastated. Now, it almost seems like he's still here. His memory lives on in the tear-jerking, gut-busting laughter of every panelist, host, and viewer, that he (and only he) could induce. Ta, Sean. Have a nice one 🍻
Rest easy legend
B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior. No peace without repentance and resurrection.
I found Sean through a Big Fat Quiz compilation in 2017 and fell into the world of overseas panel shows subsequently. I’ll always appreciate his very dry, Dad-brand humor. I’ll always appreciate the laughs. I’ll never watch any of these quite the same knowing he’s gone. RIP
What a legend. What a sad day.
He truly was one of a kind. RIP, Legend. ❤️
Just now finding out that Sean died… holy fuck that sucks… fuck… that really sucks. He had such a great mind, such creativity and awareness. I will miss miss his presence so much. People like him make the world a more bearable existence. Godspeed you magnificent bastard.
Cheers big man.... 🍺🍺
I was wondering where you were, and now I know. I'll miss you.
It truly is like a friend has passed away, Sean's humour always made feel comfortable, as though I were sat in a pub with him enjoying a pint. I'll miss him dearly.
Oh NOOOOOOO! He held up the show big time......i bet they will laugh their asses off in heaven! RIP. from Sweden.
RIP. What a loss. He was a great and hilarious human. ❤️
Don't mind if i pay my respects to the bloke
Sad sad news. Legend on the screen
Condolences to Sean's family. Yes, he will fondly remembered. Will be spending a lot of time on YouTube watching his clips. He shall suffer no more RIP.
Truly always a joy and a laugh. Rest in piece you absolute legend
Absolutely gutted. One of the few comedians that didn't even need to try to be hilarious. Legend
I've just cried with laughter listening to his rectum of the year bit. Genuinely gutted his gone, probably the funniest comedian of the last 20 years in this country. Fuck cancer.
That's a challenging wank.
Legend
Still making us laugh even after he has gone... Legend. You will be missed, but never forgotten. RIP
“Diego Maradona beat me. When he bent over… it set the sprinklers off.”  Put this on Sean’s headstone I reckon. Eternal rest, grant unto him o lord.
The swift stocking problematically itch because sign electrophysiologically scribble abaft a conscious christmas. nifty,  fretful milk
Immensely saddened at this. Honestly the funniest person ever to grace british television. Rest easy Sean, we all love you
His humor has filled so many hours of so many days for me. Thank you, Sean. You will be missed
Omg what?! I'm just hearing about this. Loved him! Rest easy, Sean 💚😭
I just found out, I'm so gutted. Having one for you mate! X 💔🖤
this is so upsetting I hope he is resting easy
Rip❤️
A genius that is lost too early in this world
Always astonishing - RIP Sean.
"I dunno. I thought it was shit." - Sean describing a little kids' performance on the Big Fat Quiz one time.
Rest in peace Sean
RIP. Comic genius.
🙏🙏🙏🍺
Devastating what a great person and comic he was r.i.p Sean Lock
RIP Sean. Thanks for the laughs 😢
So long Legend
A total legend in a class of his own. The epitome of comedy and a genuinely lovely bloke. Thank you for the countless moments of crippling laughter. Rest easy, Sean.
Thought we were done with 2020! It's riding on the back of 2021.
What a talent, so glad I go the chance to enjoy his wit, my thoughts for his wife and family for their loss.
I’m so sad to hear he has passed. I loved his humour. Rest In Peace Sean Lock 💜
The comedians comedian. Grew up watching him, he will be missed.
That was funny, my tummy hurts from laughing.
Heaven just got a lot funnier
such a special person, such an influence, such a tragedy. Sean is and will always be one of the most special comedians to me. I will miss him endlessly. Thank you for everything you did Sean, you did more than I could ever dream of in a lifetime, let alone a lifetime cut short. 🖤💔
I’m devastated. I can’t believe it
One of the most natural comedians to grace planet earth 😢 Such a great guy who was always consistently at it really tragic loss 🙌
now this is going to be a real test to jimmy's emotions. will he cry or is he the puppet we all know him as
What a loss.
😭😭😭
It's so sad. I didn't know he was battling cancer. I loved his humour. May he rest in peace and please forward my condolences to his family and friends.
I watched him on Mcintyre roadshow or what it was called. I liked him the best. Talented guy. Obviously very funny. I give him a huge amount of respect! 58 is too young to die. 20 more years is what everyone should get. At least.
Lost too early. RIP Sean Lock, King of Carrot in a Box.
R.I.P  Sean lock. You bought me laughter to no end!! Great video
I always watch countdown and fell in love with his humour right from the get go. To find out through an article that he passed and jimmpy put this link up. I felt devastated. We're all going to miss him and shows like this will never feel quite the same.    Ps. They need to bring out a dvd or something of his best moments cause i cant find a lot of my favs on yt. He was a genius.
Such a shame. Haven't been this sad about a celebrity death since Rik Mayall died back in 2014.  I always remember one of his bits describing how he would like to be disposed of when he dies........"Just roll me up in a length of carpet and dump me in a spot of oustanding natural beauty. That way even when i 'm dead i'll still be annoying people". R.I.P  Sean You utter Legend.
Two words. Fucking hilarious.
What a comedian may you rest in peace
Wow. Tragic loss :(
He was great!
Genuinely the funniest guy I’ve seen. Sad to see one of the good ones go!  RIP Sean Lock
The show will never be the same without Sean. R.I.P
How is it we have lost sean but still have gemma collins... i don't want to live on this planet anymore
Legend one of the best..will miss him.
An absolute legend. Hilarious every time RIP Sean lock!!
He will always live on in our memories ❤️
Now we're down to 7 out of 10 cats...
You could always have a laugh o 8 out10 when Sean showed his Mascot he will be so missed💔💔
Amazing, beautiful man. Will be missed.
I'm so sad today. Sean was the greatest. Through QI, 8/10 cats, and cats countdown, among other shows, and his stand-up Sean became my favourite comedian. Always loved when he was on. I can't believe he's gone. I'm just so sad, and I know you're all hurting too. I wish I could hug everybody, and his family. I'm so sorry. :(
This man makes me aspire to one day be "Rectum of the Year".
LEGEND!!!
didnt know he was 58 i thought he was maybe a hard 40ish years old
RIP. Thank you for the joy you brought into my life. Watching you in College and at Home was always a great time.
Fucken goddammit.
I am heartbroken! I loved that guy and he has brought me so much joy. RIP legend :(
Feels like getting gut punched! Sean had a wonderfully absurdist anarchy and unhinged spirit!  This is a significant loss to the world of humor. I will desperately miss laughing my self silly watching him reduce all the other contestants to tears on 8OOTC.  Rest easy mate!
God, what a shame!  I only learned about Sean (and the rest of the 8oo10c "family") in the past 3 years.  He was one of my favorites.  "The Tiger Who Came For A Pint" can still make me laugh so loud the neighbors pound on the wall. RIP, Sean. 💔
Legend level of funny .a true one off rip Sean
"Coming home to a full mousetrap..."  Legend.
Wow I laughed all the way though and then the end credits. Life hurts man. What a pleasure it was to watch him.
I am SO saddened by this shock news. RIP Sean. :(
Very sad
I just found this out through this video... Im shocked, what a loss. RIP
You don't realize how much you appreciate someone like Sean Locke until you hear he is gone.  Such a brilliant, gently hysterical sense of humour.
Just too sad. Love Sean, his erratic and quick wit will never be matched.
Best line ever …. “That’s a challenging wank”
Nobody has ever made me laugh harder and likely never will. I'm so grateful to have stumbled upon all of the British panel shows he starred in down the years. RIP Sean
Comedy genius. Whether it was scripted or off the cuff, he knew how to deliver a joke. He even made a silly game like carrot in a box hilarious. Hope there's a proper special soon with all his stand up, shows and 8 out of 10 cats.
oh man howd you leave out the clotted cream clip...that is hysterical....RIP
Made me laugh so much..always wished I could have a few pints with him ..rip Sean
It's very rare that laughing literally brings tears to my eyes. But Sean managed it regularly.
Being American, I'm sorry to say I didn't even know he was sick. But an absolute genius and one of my all time favorites. The world is much less funny today. Rest in peace Sean.
Loved this fella. Rest in peace Sean, bloody top notch.
Whooooa he was such a massive part of both shows. Man hard to hear
Its a sad day
He was the first comedian I gravitated to when I started watching English comedy panel shows. Even though he tried to come off as curmudgeonly, you can tell he was just a great guy. As well as riotously funny. This news hit me like a cannonball… Love from America. 🇺🇸
Im so sad sean is gone, he was such a staple of British television comedy and its weird to know he’s not with us anymore
RIP 💕
Words fail me, but the laughter doesn't. A great comedian who will be missed greatly.
Salute to you Sean. Thanks for the laughs..your jokes will live forever.
" He bent over,set the sprinklers off" God bless you Sean Lock.
laters bro
No way
Today we tragically lost an effortlessly funny, comedic genius. So sad. RIP.
Whay a lovely and hilariously funny man. RIP
Noooooooo  Whyyyyyyyyyyy?
R.I.P Sean, a great loss to the world your passing.
I hardly ever watched "8 out of 10" in real time. I couldn't have told you Sean's name if you asked me to. At the start of this week I clicked on a link for "8 out of 10" and laughed. I kept clicking and I laughed more and more. I wondered to myself how I missed a decade of this. I found myself laughing most when Sean started on some surreal nonsensical trip with no obvious ending. I'd end myself. The cast would end themselves. The audience would end themselves. Sean would sit there (mostly perfectly) composed and wondering what the fuss was about.  This morning while absently doing the dishes and listening to the radio I heard he'd died. I knew instantly that I thought I knew this guy. And then his face appeared. The big square jaw, peg teeth, square glasses, widow's peak, crinkly eyes. His beautiful sense of absurdity. So sad. I found you much too late Sean. But I found you. Go well.
RIP you funny bastard!!!....going to put lower watt bulbs through the house in remembrance! Thankyou from all of your Australian fans.
I think Sean has been my most watched comedian of all time. I see his clips and know what's coming as seen them 1000 times before but yet always watch them. My top 4 have got to be the Welks, not spitting on the other contestant, his greatest achievements and when him and Jon played carrot in a box. So many funny clips with him and his dry humour it was hard to pick.
RIP King.
Normally i never comment on things but this really hit me. The amount of nights during college i binged sean lock while i studied. The amount of times after work feeling down putting 8 out of 10 cats on to pass the time and bring a smile. Really got me through some tough times. Thank you Sean you will be missed.
Cheers! Cheers to this wonderful comedian.
A nice tribute to a really amazing man, you will be missed
RIP fella, not one for being touched by the death of a celeb but this guy was an absolute gem to watch
Every year or so an entertainment death hits me really hard, I remember being devistated when Ronie Corbett died, when Chadwick Boseman died I was flawed as it came out of nowhere, Rik Mayall, Stan Lee, Bobby ball, Barry Chuckle and Tim Brooke-Taylor not too long ago. Same with Sean Lock, one of the first panel shows I watched, QI he was by far the best panelist on there, nothing against the others but Sean Lock was amazing, in 8 out of 10 cats does countdown he was the heart of the show, I'm gutted for his family and friends, fuck cancer
Now the tears flow for a different reason. For so many years they were tears of laughter. Certainly one of the most entertaining comedians I have seen. I wish I had seen him on stage.
RIP
If there is a heaven, someone there is about to find out there is no carrot in their box. He will be missed, and I am so grateful for every laugh and the opportunity to rewatch all his funny moments again and again on YT.
Very funny man very sad news my thoughts are with his family and friends RIP Mr Lock
I don’t get how people are disliking this smh 💔
Rest In Peace man… you’ll be missed by pretty much anyone who ever witnessed your genius.
RIP Sean! What a top man
This is for Sean.  Noooooooo Whyyyyyyyyy Nooooooo Aaaaaahhhhhh  Gunna miss you pal
My heart hurts :(
I still can’t get over the news. This man was an absolute master at his craft and the world is a little less bright without him in it, but I’m forever grateful for all the laughs.
I really enjoyed his comedy.  That's all I can say for a man that I did not know.
This world is a sader place without him, RIP
RIP Sean. A great Comedian who will be sadly missed for his quick wit and humour.  I’m sure everyone upstairs is laughing out loud right now at Sean’s comedic genius, and someone who will never be beat in a game of Carrot in a Box xoxo
Damn, far far far too soon. What an absolute joy of a man 🥲 You definitely made your (funny) mark on the nation
Rest in peace you comedy legend, thank you for all the laughs.
So sorry for your loss guys. Loved Sean.
So f’in sad. An amazing comedian…he will be missed for sure. Prayers to his friends and family!
Sean lock has made me cry with laughter so hard I’ve been in pain and that is so rare to find nowadays. It’s strange for me to feel so passionately about the loss of a celebrity whom I never knew but I’ve truly been very sad at the news of his passing and he’ll live long in the memory of British heart and TV. May he rest in peace.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY?! NOOOOOOOOOOOO! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
RIP Sean. You are a legend.
I'm not British and I haven't really watched Sean much aside from some clips on Youtube, but every time he managed to crack me up and brighten my day a bit. RIP
As a Canadian, I got into 8 out of 10 Cats & other UK game-type shows because of Youtube. Sean was always the highlight & kept me exploring the other shows he was on. Absolutely gutted. A wit unlike any other. RIP
No words...
A true Legend! RIP The GOAT
moments ago I was just watching his videos and laughing. until I saw this "a tribute ...". now my eyes are wet. RIP "Genius" sean lock. because of you, I have laughed so many times. love from Iran.
A lot of people have died in my older years. Davie Bowie, George Michael, Prince Philip, Michael Jackson, Prince and so many more. And today, when it was announced on the radio in my car, that Sean Lock had died, was the first time that I let out a gasp of "No!". I was shocked. And today, I am very sad. Of course, I don't know him from Adam, but my god, he has entertained me over the years and literally makes tears run down my eyes. I laugh every time I watch him, even if I've seen the gags before. And that, that very quality in a funny man, is what I believe marks out the genius from just very funny. There aren't (or should I say weren't?) many like him and now we have one less. If there is an afterlife, where ever Sean has gone is better off and I really hope I end up there. RIP. You are a treasure that we are lucky to have recorded. May you forever win, "Carrot in a Box".
RIP Sean. One of my favorite comedians. We are so lucky to be able to enjoy your work on repeat. Thanks Youtube!
Such a pity. R.I.P.
Shit. More laughter gone. RIP Mr. Lock. I'll miss you.
No more Sean vs Jon rivalry, no more Sean & Miles bromance, still no Nazi Island, no more 2nd rectum of the year, no more the bad kid in the show, no more mr. Mistery Box. This is heartbreaking.
Consistantly made me belly laugh, and im saddened that therell be no more new deadban fuckery.
He will be missed by many. Thank you for all the laughs, sir.
RIP Sean- Sean lock will always be one of the funniest people in the world. Sending you all love ❤️ to family friends and the entire comedy world xx
Sean has been my favourite unsung hero of comedy for a very long time. What an absolute legend he was/is still.  Life is incredibly cruel but God I'm thankful his unique comedy style was shared with us while he was here.   Your comedy lives on my friend :)
Way too young.  He was so funny.
Never even knew he was ill. He was the best comedian of all time in my opinion. Totally unique and incredibly funny.
This is a sad sad day.
Glad to have a place to express my shock at hearing of Sean's passing. Thanks for the humanity and the humour, you are sorely missed.
Damn, RIP to one of the funniest people I've ever seen
Brilliant comic absolutely adored him .Just read what a shock
Sad day he is my favourite comedian
RIP Jimmy
R.I.P to a comedy legend
Miss you mate, absolutely gutted but your comedy will live on forever
Whether he was making the panel and us at home cry from laughter, or he was nearly in tears himself from truly enjoying the joke of a fellow comedian, he was always one of the best. Rest in peace.
Still doesn’t seem real. So shocking. So sad. How can someone who was so full of the joy of life …What a terrible loss. RIP.
He'll be remembered for so many things, but most of all, his crowning achievement: Nazi Island. RIP Sean, thank you so much for the laughs.
Who’s disliking the video
This one was flooring, ive never heard about a celeb passing and it hit like this news did, the funniest man in Britain gone, RIP Sean you absolute legend.
RIP mate, you were the highlight of 8 out of 10
R.I.P. Sean, Thanks for making me laugh even when I didn't want to. X
Anytime I see a full mousetrap, I will forever be reminded of Sean
Thank you for so many fits of laughter. Thanks for the hilarity. Thanks for the joy. Thank you, Sean, for being so fantastic and for bringing light and laughter to me and to many others.
Oh dear I am so sorry to hear this.  Always loved his humour. Gone far too soon.
my absolute legend, he was the blue collars comic,loved him to bits.
Tragic loss, but what a legacy to leave behind. One of the funniest ever!
Damn...
RIP 🐐
a great guy and the best thing about Cats does Countdown especially when he acted like he didn't give a shit when on lol and all his 'mascots'. The props department alone on that show came up with a lot of weird stuff for him over the years lol. I'll be interested to see if they find a permanent replacement for him on the show but it won't be the same without him
Perhaps my favourite comedian. I just can’t believe it
RIP sean, hes in a better place now :(
Just a legend…rest well
Sean Lock, never ceased to make me cry with laughter. Rest in peace sir
Nooooooo..... he hasn't died has he? I love his humour.... what a great guy he seems to be. A dreadful loss, he really will be sorely missed  Thanks for the hours of laughter Sean. Thoughts are with his family.
His videos made me go through the pandemic, his comedy and personality were truly one of a kind, rest in peace gentleman, we will always miss you
absolutely loves sean lock one of the funny comedians we had left on tv ..... such a loss .. rip sean
Sean and Claude just rocked up to Nazi island with guns akimbo and started mowing them down, all the while laughing. Godspeed
Legend rip
Wow. Can’t believe this dude is dead. A truly funny man with a heart of gold. Rip funny man👍
I’m in disbelief, this came out of no where. Rest in Peace Sean, thank you for always making me laugh
we dont get this pommy comedy stuff on holier than thou tv in New Zealand...all we get is reality crap tv shows and csi shit, so i got my almost daily laugh on you tube with Sean Lock and others....and my day or night was always brighter, and often with tears from laughing.....Good Speed Mr Lock, you will be forever remembered....YNWA.
RIP. thanks for all the laughs.
Dear Sean, thank you for all the laughs, out of all the 8ootc guys, you were the one I wanted to meet most, absolute legend of a man, you'll be up there taking the piss out of someone, well missed
Oh man. This opening with him describing himself already moved me.
R.I.P 🥺 you will be missed
This is horrible. Absolutely horrible.
I thank this man for making me laugh 1000s of times throughout the years. What a hero. Rip Sean x
It's a little absurd to learn about someone's death on YouTube. Sean would have been proud
One of the greatest and funniest of all time. RIP legend ❤️
Sean and Claude just rocked up to Nazi island with guns akimbo and started mowing them down, all the while laughing. Godspeed
God rest you. You will be sadly missed.
Seans a legend
Can't believe he is gone R.I.P Sean lock
RIP...I'll add some Bovril and whelks to my evening cocktail for you
A devastating loss. Wonderful comedic mind.
Billy Connolly once said “Political Correctness is the language of cowardice”, Sean must have been cut from the same cloth and I thank them both for that! RIP good sir and thanks for the comedy gold which was your bromance with Miles Jupp
I did not realize how impactful his death would be to me until I remembered all the joy he brought, he was truly a comedian’s comedian, he will be remembered…always
Such a great dry sense of humor. He will be missed by so many.🙏🏻
Sean Lock's' Nazi Island TV show is one the best moments on TV! RIP Sean, you bought tears of laughter to the world.
Rip... I know he would hate that we were all commenting on social media about him. He was always as funny as it could get!  Thoughts for his family..
Rest in peace dude, if there is an afterlife may you have a whale of a time entertaining them
Rest in peace Sean ❤️
Gutted RIP
A true loss. Rest in peace.
One of the best comedians England have ever produced. Very sad to hear, thoughts go to his family and friends
The last truly funny comedian on the vile BBC/ITV/C4 gravy train of unfunny hard left woke mediocrities that have infested British comedy like the cancer that killed this genius. We are tragically left with an entire generation of metrosexual tossers whose entire joke collection consists of "Thatcher bad, Boris bad, Orange man bad"  If only we were discussing Nish Kumar, Katherine Ryan and Frankie Boyle
Heartbreaking. He was truly one of the greats.
Rest in Peace, Sean. You were a great comedian and you made my life and many other's brighter having been in it.
No one has ever made me laugh as hard as he did. Pure genius. Wish I had a chance to see him live.
he will be remembered. R.I.P. Sean
Sean and Miles where too funny together. Still can't get over how he has gone so young, RIP to one of the funniest men
Great bloke Sean....always made me laugh. RIP
This man is a LEGEND
That moment when you see this, and find out sean locks passed away... "Oh! ......oh...." 😭😓
Heartbreaking 💔
I had to google it as soon as I saw this suggestion. British comedy genius!!
😭
RIP Sean, gone but never forgotten.
<3
now tears of sadness... thanks for making us laugh and feel better, RIP
I liked the episode where he did the 'cat litter tray challenge'. Hahaha
This was a challenging wank
He dedicated his life to bringing joy and happiness to us all. That gift will never be forgotten. Goodbye Sean.
I'm sure he's in heaven right now, conning some angel out of his wings.
Ledgend x
I’m so sad by this.
Cannot believe he has actually died. It seems so unreal. Only watching him last night then hear this news this morning. So devastated. RIP, Sean.
You'll be missed, sir. Thank you for making us laugh, and be reminded of not taking ourselves too seriously. May you rest in peace.
RIP Sean .
What a shame what a loss, the man always cracked me up, very smart, very very good comedian, so sorry, very funny guy
Legend
I had the honour of growing up with his genius dry and spontaneous humour and it is a great shame he has left us so soon although he is gone I will be sure to at the right time introduce my two boys hope just a little of his wit influences them as it has me rest in peace
There's infinite carrots in the boxes where you are now Sean.
Am absolutely gutted pure legend am so thankful to you for the happiness you have given to me an my family x
Loved Sean’s comic dagger-like warmth. Brilliant. It all looked so easy.. sorry you’ve gone.
I am devastated and heartbroken to hear of Sean's passing. Yesterday I was laughing hysterically while watching a compilation of Sean's appearances in 8 out of 10 cats and 8 out of 10 cats does countdown. Rest in peace and may God's Blessings be upon your family and friends during this grieving time. 🙏😭💔
R.I.P. Brother
"She's got amazing tits!" - Sean Lock
Aww man. This news really sucked. I hate that I didn't know about this show sooner. Sean made me laugh so many times. RIP you magnificent Maniac.
He was one of the best comedians to have on panel shows in the uk, made Jimmy cry laughing aswell as me. Rip Sean lock you legend
By far our best comedian of the present day. Gutted. Thanks for making me laugh so much .😪
Vey sad. Brilliant comedian and foil for Jimmy. How will he cope.
Rest in peace brother.
Forever made me laugh until now....i will miss him so much
Why would someone dislike this
:'(
What a legend. A sensation. An idea. RIP.
Shocked and disbelief.
Ah, I'm absolutely gutted for his family, his friends, his fans. What a funny guy. I didn't know he was ill. You'll be remembered fondly with a smile Sean. ❤️❤️✌️
What a loss... RIP 😭
Absolutely shocked when I heard this today. Never stopped trying to make us laugh until the end
I was wondering why Sean was trending and I wish it wasn't true. Fuck cancer. RIP Sean
My heart is beyond broken. He’s pulled me out of so many dark moments. Rest in peace Sean 💔
What a legend. He was so funny in so many ways. We lost someone special today.
The News is a Gouge in My Heart. The Hours of Howling Laughter this man has wrenched from my body, gladly. We will always have his Gritty Products on CatsDoesCountdown, A-ZCocktail A-ZStew, eating whelks 'til he was sick. Do You Appreciate How Lucky We Were? Thank you Mr. Lock.These Tears ARE For You.
The best!!
Shit, he died? =( Man, this guy was fuckin' hilarious. Thanks for all the laughs, man.
Well done C4 for doing this...I dont normally pay much attention to 'celebrity' deaths - it's not that I'm heartless I just didnt know them and many people die every day who no one except family and friends mourn. But Sean's death really upset me...one because he was only 58 and two because he seemed like a really good bloke...and very very funny. RIP 😢
What an absolute legend so so gutted RIP FAB FELLA 😢😢😢
I’m rarely star struck but on seeing Sean at a service station getting a Costa, I had to go and tell him how brilliant I thought he was. I’m so glad I did. He just grinned and said, “Cheers.” I only really watched 8/10 Cats Does Countdown for Sean, especially for his hilariously stupid mascots. A fabulously clever, quick witted, and unique comedy genius of our time and this programme won’t be the same without him.
Another treasure lost. Thank you to him for everything. My condolences to his family and everyone lucky enough to call him a friend.
this is hilarious. RIP
god no! devastated to hear, his absence will be felt  for a very long time.  thanks for your comedic contribution to our mad lives 😞  Vale Sean
I will never forget Sean Lock and the carrot. His wit and humour was all about subverting expectations.  He will be missed.
Bless him always makes me laugh when I watch him. RIP ❤️
Both 8 out of 10 cats shows can’t be the same now! Rip Sean lock 💔 gone but never forgotten
A modern day comedy legend. R.I.P.
F
There’s only one Sean.. he can never be replaced on this show.. RIP you legend and thank you for making me laugh so many times
15
Sean was never afraid to make any type of joke no matter how inappropriate or offensive, and that is why I will miss him dearly.
😢 RIP Sean Lock, Legend!
Rest In Peace
Aw man so bad maybe some will watch 5 storeys high now With benedict wong  pure Comedy
RIP Sean you legend 😢
Well, Sean, Rik Mayall, Tommy Cooper. That is some fucking party.
Absolute legend and the forever carrot in a box champion RIP
We’ve lost an Absolute Legend!! RIP fella
What a legend. Not only was he a brilliant comedian, he was also the "Undisputed, undefeated, carrot in a box champion" as stated by Jon Richardson. RIP.
How much laughter and joy has this man given us, absolutely uncountable. RIP.
god damn ..
What a funny dude,  he will be missed 😢
A great loss .. Thank you for the laughs Sean lock .
A very funny all round great guy gone too soon Rip you will keep me laughing as always
RIP
Who goes out of their way to dislike a video paying tribute to someone
He was really one of my idols and I have adored him for such a while now this really breaks my heart.
Maybe it’s my age but today I shed more than a few tears in both laughter and sadness.  RIP Sean.
I thought this was a joke at first... this is devastating Sean was hilarious and will be forever immortalised through his comedy! Rest in Peace
What a genius comedian. He stood head and shoulders above everyone else. I was hoping to see a live performance of Sean some time. Such a loss to the world of comedy. My thoughts are for his wife and children right now. So sad.
Gutted. RIP mate.  Tears of laughter and sadness.
Miss you sean
RIP (((
What did he say at 4:34?
God bless Mr Lock.  Rest in peace. Thanks for all the laughs.
Who?
RIP. Thanks for the tears of laughter.
Rip
Watching this put a smile on my face like watching him many times before RIP ❤️
I am heartbroken. First saw him on QI years ago and loved him from then on. Such a wonderful dry humour. Much love to all who loved him from Australia.
Normally on one of these ‘memorial’ clips of a passed one made me cry. I was ready to cry. But I can’t. He is just that funny.
I didn’t even know Sean was ill or anything, obviously found out the news this morning & I can’t believe it. Panel shows won’t be the same without him. Rip Sean
Adult humour disclaimer, it is a tribute to Sean Lock, self explanatory.
Best joke is when he said. I wont spit on you when we have sex today.  And Jimmy Carr is crying of laughter brilliant
RIP
Thank you Sean, so many laughs 💔
Gone but not forgotten, another comical genius taken away
First Paul Ritter and now Sean Lock…please, no more! 😢
Sean's work has got me through so many hard times in life. I can't believe he's just gone... Rest in piece, you're greatly missed
As A Yank I love accents and when I started watching the show years ago on the YouTube Sean felt like what I would love to have as like a English father figure a brilliant man.
Now he's up there with Diego Maradona having a laugh!
So in shock, what a comedy Legend,   A comedy genius, a carrot keeping champion! A comedians comedian!  will be forever missed. Thank-you Sean,  RIP
I still can't believe he passed away, i adore Sean lock and his comedic style. I've been crying like a baby because i wished for more years with this brilliant man. Rest in peace my friend. 💙
R.I.P. Sean - You left this world way to early, you crazy old goof :*(
Made me laugh my balls off, enough said, a true comic
I couldn’t believe that. I still can’t. May he Rest In Peace. 😞
Rest In Peace and love to his family and friends , god bless
Legend
Rest In Peace and God bless you Sean
What an absolute comedy legend, watching his highlights on 8 out of ten cats does countdown never failed to make me laugh out loud despite the fact I’d already watched them 100 times. Will be missed massively, RIP ❤️
Am gutted. What a legend.
Sean, thank you for all the laughter! You always behaved like ""who cares i might die in the next minute so i`m gonna have fun all the time... Just in case that happens...""    and i hope you had your fun !!!!!!! ;)
I still cant believe this the world is a shitter place without you Sean this has really devastated me. Rest Well Sean
Wonderfully funny man.  RIP.
💗✌💗
Great comic and a great mind but most of all a great human being. You’ll be missed Sean. Much love
Thank you so much for the laughs over the years Sean. You will be missed. RIP you legend!
❤️❤️❤️
British comedy TV shows has been one of my staples during lockdown and Sean was a major player and a great force in these. Thank you Sean , you will be missed
Sean's Carrot in a Box is the best example of gamesmanship ever.  Devastated that he left us so soon.
How could you not love Sean Lock? Everytime he opened his mouth someone died laughing. True comedic legend and the comedy world lost a true heavyweight.
Love to Sean's family from Ireland. What a master of his craft! R.I.P Mr lock!
Brilliant Comedian, shame he's gone, such a unique brand of humour.
Easily one of my favourite comedians. I watch clips of him almost daily. Rest in peace
RIP Sean  National treasure  Comic god  Legend
Grew up watching Sean Locke, so sad knowing that he's gone. Genuinely one of the funniest British comics to do it. Rest in Peace
Farewell. You are a fucking legend mate.
Will be sadly missed. Thank you for all the laughter
I’m so saddened by this news. Literally one of my favorite people to watch! He was amazing!
Undefeated. Undisputed. Carrot in the box champion. You will be missed, friend.
Absolutele bloody British legend.. RIP To a comedy genius
He was such a great comic that many a time he had me laughing with tears of joy but now my tears are of sorrow. RIP you legend.
Well damn
His voice sounded weak towards the end of the clips, and he was still pulling it out the bag to make us laugh. What a consummate performer, giving us joy and giving us an authenticity and real ness that was so natural. His jokes were so creative and he never had to try. I’m a bit desensitised to death notices but hearing the news today made the tears fall. RIP Sean. There will never be another comedian like you. What a legacy to leave X 💐
An amazing comedian, taken far, far too soon.
one of the funniest people i've seen...8 out of 10 cats does countdown will never be the same....R.I.P. Sean...you'll be missed
Such sad news. From an American who simply thinks that Sean Lock was one of the funniest people to exist, thank you for so many good memories. He will be missed.
I can’t watch this without crying man
Rip Sean, you'll be greatly missed.
i typed ‘8 out of 10 cats does countdown’ to find a laugh from sean..... not this
He broke Claudia Winkleman.
Im so fucking sad right now. I didnt know someone i havent met will make me feel this way. Sean you were one of the people that made my quarantine bearable. Thank you. RIP Sean you will be missed.
A sad day for comedy losing a natural talent. Take note world, laugh, be happy and kind because you just never know when it's time to leave.
He was a brilliant comedian. How can you forget about him and Miles Jupp together? Miles: "He was whispering to me about Hitler." Jimmy: "What did he say?" Miles: "I don't know about you Miles, but I'm on the fence."
Legend! My heart breaks for us all as the world looses such an amazing guy with an even better laugh. You are missed!!!
:(
R.I.P. ya smart fulla
As a foreigner and non native speaker i just cant find the words to say how devastated i am. Even if dont know him he somehow meant so much to me. The World of Comedy and these clips wont be the same without him. Rest in Peace Sean
RIP Sean  Massive talent in comedy, will be missed  Hope you have some laughs up above ❤️
One of the funniest stand up comedians of all time. Gone far too young . RIP Sean  thanks for the laughs, they will live on forever.
I like to think of Sean as The Ebenezer Scrooge of Comedy. I can’t explain why, but it just seems fitting.   R.I.P. Sean. Thank you for the laughs
Rest in peace, Sean. You have left this world too soon, however, you leave us all with smiles and laughter from your incredible wit and comedy.
It's been hours now after I saw the news but the sadness has not become any less bearable. You are so missed John 😢
R. I. P. Sean you are legend who will be greatly missed. 😢
He was a sensation
I can't believe it
Who ever the people are who put a dislike the 106 people so far are absaloutly sad individuals this guy was great sensation. To comedy and to put a smile on faces plz think again and change the thumbs down rest in peace Sean lock
So sorry for a great loss. May he rest in peace.
In stiches here 😂 Legend will keep people laughing for years.
Noooooo!!! Whyyyyy!!! Noooooo!!! Ahhhhhh!!!
Sean’s a ruddy genius. Funniest man I’ve ever seen; I could watch this over and over and never stop laughing 😂. He’ll be so very missed.
This has really saddened me. I absolutely Love Sean's comedy, All I can say is, if there is a spirit world, they're in for a treat !!. Mum..... wait til you see this guy :O)
Sean helped me through the toughest times of my life. I owe him more than I can say. He was a gift to this earth and the world will never be the same without him in it. May you rest in peace, the truest of comedy legends. You will never ever ever be forgotten. Love and peace to his friends and family, I can’t imagine the pain they feel. A star shines brighter in the night sky for you. May you find peace on your venture into the other side. Rest easy, king amongst men,
RIP Sean Lock. Absolutely adored his comedic style he brought to Cats does Countdown. I was do distraught when I heard the news today. You will be forever missed Sean ❤
Best of the best
A true legend. Rest In Peace.
Bless his family x
What an absolute legend he was, rest in peace Sean, gone but never forgotten 🙏🏾🥺😔
Was in my Google news feed earlier today. Count myself as one of his American fans. Loved his style of humor. Suppose humour would be more appropriate. Either way, definitely a bummer.
RIP Legend
What a legend. He'll be sorely missed.
What a huge loss. He'll be sorely missed
Thank you for the years of entertainment and side splitting laughter I'm absolutely gutted a true legend
Read about it today, man didn't even know he was sick ☹️
love him. what wan inspirational character
R.I.P so shocked when he died. Prayers go out to his family and friends. We have lost a lovely man who made us all Laugh. R.I.P Sean
Weve lost a legend :(
Rest in Peace you absolute legend
I don't understand why this video has 100+ dislikes
No more carrot in a box 😥.  RIP you legend
Rest in peace you funny, funny man.
Rest in piece he was one of the funniest men to ever grace tv he will be missed now heaven will be a place filled with laughter rest in piece ❤🙏
🎵 if you wanna get a tapeworm eat some pork
Such a funny and unique comedian. Great loss.😥
He was so quick: Rachel wears a Viking helmet and beard… “that’s a challenging‘….’ ” 😂😂
Rest in peace with couple of carrots you won, Sean!
Somewhere in the next life Sean Lock and Diego Maradona are having rematches in "Rectum of the year". RIP Legend
There were many reasons he was my favourite comedian, but one of them was because he reminded me a little bit of my grandad. I lost my grandad last year but watching Sean on old 8 out of 10 cats episodes helped me feel a little better. I was so shocked and sad to hear he had passed I guess it’s started making me miss my grandad again too. RIP Sean, thank you for all the tears of laughter you’ve given me.
Gonna miss you Sean you were one of a kind
Sean... thank you for all the laughs you left too early!
One of the best British comedians ever in my opinion. He stood out for his humour even amongst other great comics. R.I.P 🙏
RIP 🙏🏻💙
Thanks for all the laughs.
Oh bless his heart ❤  Thank you Sean Lock for all the laughs.
So sad....another great....gone way too soon...be at peace Sean Lock....
Was stunned to hear of his passing, no age at all. Rest well Sean.
God dammit another great person has been taken away from us but may he rest with his “carrot in a box”, one of the best comedians. Rip Sean lock 🥺
A natural. Comedic master. Sad sad day. Rest in peace Sean.
RIP Sean, life can be so cruel 💙
Brilliant comedian. Loved his comedy. RIP Sean Lock
Remember that time when Sean Lock, mimed Hitler, Shimming up a coconut tree?
RIP Sean, thanks for all the laughs
Rip 🪦 gone but not forgotten ❤️❤️
One of the greatest comedians of all times has left us today. Thanks for all the laughs, you will live on in our hearts
R.I.P Sean, one of the greats in my eyes, your work on Mock the week and Out of 10 cats has been whats got me through some tough times. legend!
Like losing the best uncle I never had.
RIP Sean
So sad that Sean's gone but he lives on in comedy we can still watch the memories of great comedy hes  left us Sean was a genuis at making someone laugh naturally funny guy he will be deeply missed rip Sean lock
Total Gem is He 💎💎💎💎 rip god rest his soul 🙌🙌🙌
I had a smile from ear to ear, which disappeared instantly as soon as it was mentioned that Sean had passed. RIP, we will all miss him.
Still can’t believe he’s gone. Genuinely heartbroken.
Sean Lock was a gifted comedian, and 8 Out of 10 Cats were some of my comfort videos when I wanted to stop thinking about the pandemic; I hope his family and friends find comfort in the wake of his passing.
That’s crazy. I’m from America and I love watching these clips from England. Sean and John are the best
RIP Sean. By far my favourite comedian. You will be missed.
I’m surprised how much Sean locks death has affected me, it’s like losing a friend. R.I.P. 🇬🇧😢
I'm already missing Sean
Thanks for all the laughs, Sean.
What a loss. Bloody funny guy. Gone way too young.
How can 105 people dislike this? RIP Sean, you had me in tears watching 8 out of 10 Cats on a good few occasions.
Damn.....that man will be missed......
A light has gone out . We are all the less for it. God bless and truly thank you.
The dislikes on this video are from all the people Sean’s already beaten at Carrot In A Box in heaven.
This tribute could be hours long full of all the weird and wonderfully hilarious bits he’s done over the years. No one could do it quite like Sean! Thank you for the laughs.
comedy legend ...
The amount of laughter this guy gave me at my lowest, RIP you absolute legend !
I'm utterly stunned and gutted in equal measure. I can't believe he'll never screw Jon Richardson over in "Carrot in a Box" ever again. 😔
One of the best there ever will be.
Next time I pour myself a glass of canal water, I’ll look up and say cheers to one of the funniest comedians of all time. Thanks for the laughs Sean.
RIP. Such a sad day. Laughed so hard watching you on this show.
I found out Sean died because of this video.  It's a very bittersweet feeling.  He was such a great comedian and it's hard to believe he'll only be seen in rebroadcasts from now on, but these clips are hilarious.  😢  Such a sad day.
I was genuinely shocked to find out Sean Lock passed away. RIP. What an amazing and funny comedian he was.
Oh crap. Rest in peace and make everyone laugh on the other side, Sean. I was in Highgate Woods a couple of years ago and realised that the Dad investing so much energy setting fun challenges for his kids, was Sean. Tried not to stare. Couldn't.
Thank you Sean for all the time you shared with us. You will always be in our hearts and I will watch at least a million other performances, clips and videos starring you!
So heartbroken
I only knew him through 8 out of 10 cats reruns on YouTube but it still feels like such a huge loss. So many great memories watching him on the show.
We're all writing tears, Sean. RIP and thank you.
Gutted. 😔 What a legend.
RIP Mr Lock.  <raises a glass of water>
I fuckin loved this guy so much. Doesn't matter how down I felt i could just watch nazi Island sketch and id be in stitches. RIP my man
Thanks you for all the laughs Sean and rest easy! Absolutely heartbroken 💔
God Bless The Family 🙏🏻 I'll Be Sure To Light A Candle And Say A Few For You All 💚🇮🇪
I’m crying now. I hadn’t realised this had happened as I’m over in Australia. This bloke is comedy
I guess we'll never see Jon win Carrot in a Box against Sean. :(
A legend in his own mind. A memory for all kind. Rest well Sean.
I was so sad to hear this news today. One of the greatest comedic minds of all time
Such a loss.
You could make an hours long compilation of Sean's best bits, he was that good. He'll be missed
actual genius and complete legend
Gutted
RIP Sean, brought so much joy to people. You will be missed
The only comedian that i can watch many times and still makes me laugh. Very underrated, and his comedy is rare.
Absolutely devastating
First time I’ve watched him with tears that aren’t from laughing.  RIP Sean 💙
Commiserations to Sean’s family. Like thousands of his fans, my family will miss him too. If you were feeling down, Sean’s humour would make you laugh tears. Godbless Sean. Xx
Whoever dislikes this video, get help frfr
I don’t usually comment on YouTube but I have to pay my respects to Sean, I have watched him for years and loved him on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown, really cheered me up during lockdown. So sad RIP
RIP Sean.  You've been entertained us and gives us laughers. You're a comedic legend. Rest easy now.
Now we'll never see Sean lock and Robin Williams together.
Oh what a Gentleman
RIP Sean Lock. His rectum of the year skit, for me, was the best. We need more of your humour, Sean. Gone but not forgotten, sir. 😭
It’s scary how fast life has past! A few years ago first time watching Sean, making me laugh to now! Passed on :(. May you rest in peace sean ❤️
Rip legend
Oh fuck off, Sean died? Man, these last couple years have been the worst. Sweet dreams buddy.
RIP.
That is very sad news. May he rest in peace.
Amazing talent, rip
R.I.P
Well thats me going to binge watch everything Sean, just so I cling to a little more of him.  Never new the man, though sure wish I did.
I'm a musician.  This came up in my notifications mid song and I started visibly tearing up on stage.  The man was a legend and will be missed beyond belief.   RIP Sean
Forever Missed, now spending lockdown re-watching sean locks greatest bits
Fuck cancer….rip Sean.
Still can't believe he's gone, one of the funniest comedians to walk this earth
The time when Sean lost it laughing at Joe's 'I named your penis poem' was soooooo funny.
Wow.
So so sad. His dry sense of humour was second to none. You will be missed. RIP Sean 😢
why is there 104 thumbs down, REALLY ffs the man was a legend
Oh no. I'll really miss Sean. Bon voyage.
Still can't believe it, not Sean there's just no way 😭 we will miss you so much, thankyou for the endless laughs you e given us, gone but never forgotten 😭😭
Rip legend you’ll never be forgotten Sean !!!
I'm so sad, I'm going to miss his humor. He was so amazing on panel shows. Rest in peace. You were one of the greats. 😢
Haven’t even watched this yet but i already know carrot in a box is by far the funniest thing I’ve ever seen, absolute legend of man!
He was genuinely one of my favorite comedians.  So sad that cancer took him so early.  He has left a treasure trove of laughter and good humor behind.
Being from outside the UK, Sean only came across my radar recently. Still, I feel like I've known about him for years. He was like your favorite naughty uncle.   You will truly be missed, sir.
Cant belive this beacon of British comedy has passed man. Such a shame. My heart gos out to his family and friends. 💯👏🏻👏🏻🤝🏻👊🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Genuinely so unbelievably sad, one of the few comedians who was able to make me laugh as hard when performing solo as he did bouncing off of others, a real, down to earth, genuinely funny person, RIP
SL was an absolute genius. He wasn't a comedian, he didn't need scripts or to rehash old material on different panel shows. He was just a naturally gifted man that could pull humour off the cuff, so underated and so intelligent. Sad loss. Rip
I’ve watched so many clips of Sean Lock today and they have all made me cry with laughter. A hilarious man that made it look so so easy. Maybe for him it was easy. His delivery was fantastic, his mannerisms won’t be matched and him laughing at himself was brilliant. It’s great to see how loved he was by everybody that had watched him on tv or seen him live.   Heaven just got a whole lot funnier.  RIP Sean Lock
Crying. Laughing. Crying.  So very sad that we will never hear him again.
Just heard about Sean, so terrible and tragic.  One of the best members of Cats does Countdown by far.  RIP Sean.
Noooooooooooooo  The man made me laugh suffering through the losses of so many dear to me these last few years.  One of the funniest people I'll never know.   Devastated.
Thank you Sean, for the chuckles and the tears of laughter.
I still can't believe it. I never thought that a celebrity death would actually affect me, but here I am all day feeling like someone punched me. RIP Sean. British comedy, panel shows, nothing will be the same without you.
RIP king
Wish they'd included "total comedy" - his box of, uh, "comedy characters" Cheeky Lionel and Darcy Wimbles. Absolute legend. RIP <3
Such a wonderful soul has left us, still making us laugh from beyond the grave...
RIP, so young
I was shocked today when I heard the news of his passing such a funny funny man! He will be greatly missed but never forgotten
Slating the kids of Mitchellbrook primary on Big Fat Quiz of The Year for there acting, telling everyone on 8 out of 10 cats does Countdown that ‘That’s a challenging wank’ talking about Rachel and his game of carrot in a box with John Richardson on 8 out of 10 cats, so many laughs and many many tears. What a comedian. What a man. He’ll be sorely missed. RIP Sean!
I grew up watching Sean Lock on 8 out of 10 cats, I always remember this bit he did with Jedward which left me in tears.  He was the best part of it and on cats does countdown he was incredibly funny.  This news really upset me today, because he seemed such a larger than life character.  RIP Sean, you brought us a lot of happiness.
I’m not sure where else to write this so I’ll write it here.Thanks for giving me years of laughter Sean, most of it through tears. I appreciate all that you’ve done, and I thank you for that. Rest easy mate, love you.
Gutted.  Brilliant comedian. One of my all time favourite comedians. RIP Sean.
OMG, I can't believe we lost Sean...    He was so so so funny.   I have really fallen in love with some of the British game shows, particularly 8OOTCDC.    In pace requiescat sir!
Legend.
You gave me, as a swede, so much laughter and comfort. Thanks for everything. I hope you get a nice stella where you are now mate. Thanks once again.
God bless, you will be amongst the best now 👍👍
<3
Sad news of Sean's passing...i shall lift a pint in his honor...RIP...
So sad, fabulously funny man.
What an absolute legend, Love you Sean RIP
The funniest man of our generation.
Rip sean
Thanks for all the laughs. You will be missed Sean. Sending lots of love from Argentina
Huge loss. A comedic genius and, from all accounts, a wonderful man. ❤️ If we could redo his 'National Treasure' bit, he would definitely go in the 'Yes' pile. RIP
So sad to hear of your passing Sean, the love shown by your peers shows how much they admired your talent, sleep well xx
pour one out to a legend today folks.
🪦 RIP
Funny man Will be missed 🥲
Will be very sadly missed
Everyone who dislikes this is going to hell.
Very unique and very brilliant.
This is a real shock, I never knew he was ill. The comedian who could bring comedians to tears...
Sean, thank you for all of the endless laughs you’ve given me over the years. I’ve loved hearing your sarcastic comments and witty demeanor. I’m genuinely gonna miss having your jokes in my life- guess I’ll simply have to watch these clips on repeat forever. RIP Sean 💔
Never knew this guy until today, he an instant legend to me
I discovered him through you tube on 8 out of 10 cats . Man was hilarious , my favorite is when he said to Miles , I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex later , I cried laughing . RIP Sean .
I was genuinely shocked and upset at the news that he's died. Far, far too soon.
Rest In Peace, comedy Legend. Famous enough to be known as far as Canada (at least).
love you bro, take care.
Thank you Sean
Sean Lock passing away, is a serious blow to me having a good day. One of my absolute fav comedians, always making me smile and laugh.  R.I.P. Sean, you will never be forgotten.
Such a cliche but there really never will be another like him. Thank you so very much for all the fun and laughs. You brightened many a moment. God bless you and rest easy
RIP Legend, you'll be missed
thank you so much Sean for the many laughs and happy moments you gave me. RIP LEGEND
I just discovered Sean and the rest of the gang in the last year. This was like a gut punch to even a new fan like myself
Who the fuck would thumbs down a video like this? The man's barely in the ground.
Rest In Peace
Even in Holland we feel the pain of Sean moving to a better place, thank you for everething Sean!🌹
I Often have tears of laughter watching Sean lock. Incredibly funny guy. R.i.p
The King of cool, sharp and quick wit. You'll be missed, fella
One of my favourites. On tele let alone all of comedy. Gutted to learn he’s passed away. I’m sure he’s got everyone up there in stitches already. Legend. And a wonderful man. Rest in Peace Sean. Love to the Lock Family at this difficult time. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I already watched all of the 8 out of 10 cats moments over 10 times this year now I have to watch them again a great loss to the world
honestly, sean has gotten me through the lockdowns. i don't normally post comments but i will miss him.
RIP 😭😭😭
😥rip sean
He was the reason I got interested in British comedy in general, forever a universal treasure.
I loved his sense of humour, i will miss him greatly
Legend
That "Greatest Achievement" story was the first thing I thought of when I heard Sean had passed. That story will ALWAYS be with me. No matter how I try to run from it.
❤️
I'm off to the shops for some hot tarmac and a vets flannel.
Very funny guy. I really liked his humor style his presence made shows like this very fun. My condolences to his family and all of his friends, over there, here, everywhere. RIP.
I saw a Tweet from Jason Manford saying that Sean Lock had died. I didn't know he was even ill. The world has lost an amazing and funny man. He will be greatly missed! Rest in peace Mr. Sean Lock.
Sad news today. Heaven got a hell of a lot funnier today though 😉🙏🏻
Devastated 😔
Rest in fucking peace man. You were truly one of the fucking greats.
When I was at uni aged 19 just a few years ago, I was so close to ending my life. I was thinking of ways to do this, I had one of Sean’s best bits videos in the background on YouTube. It gave me a sense of comfort. Suddenly I paused my brain from thinking and turned my attention to the video “What would you want your orbituary to say sean?”   “I don’t care, I’d be dead” in the severe depressive state I was this made me laugh so much because he was joking about the very thing which I could have faced, death. And laughing at my own situation was a coping mechanism for me. But that line from Sean made me realise that if I was still able to laugh even at my lowest point, then life was worth carrying on for. Sean will never know but he saved my life that day and whenever I feel shit I will always watch his clips. I have never felt this sad and broken about any celebrities death before, but to me he was more than just that, he was a hero to me and if I could have just 1 minute with him to say thank you, because without Sean in this world I may not have lived to tell this story.   Your memory will love on forever, thank you for the laughs. Comedy will never be the same, RIP to one of the greatest there will ever be 😢
Thanks for the years of laughter Sean. You won't be forgotten. Go easy brother. RIP
Gutted. Thanks vor all the laughs.
What a legend...it's heartbreaking he had to die so young 😭😭😭
''When I die.....I'd like to be flytipped'' - Seal Lock *What a legend*
Yeah Sean Lock Down was a Lad and he never lost that just down played it for Tele!......Mr Jangels
I didn’t laugh at all his jokes. Just the funny ones. He will be missed.
My lord what a horrible thing to just learn about right now - this seriously has put me in a sour mood. I'm truly upset, he was still so filled with life - FUCK CANCER - I'll miss Sean, one of my favorite British comedians of all time, his guest appearances on this show as well as QI  automatically raised the entertainment value 10-fold. His comedy legacy will live on forever. What a tragedy I swear. All my love to you Sean, all the way from Puerto Rico, Rest in Peace.
RIP to one of the funniest on TV, always had everyone laughing, taking too soon.
Pinnacle of British humor. Devastated.
R.I.P
My absolute hero. Devastated to hear the news. Much love to his family and friends. We love you Sean.
Like the uncle/neighbour I wished I’d had. One of the last greats. Rip Sean
Claudia Winkleman in tears crying, asking Sean to stop because he was making her laugh so much with his rectum of the year story, is pure gold ❤
RIP :(
Nooooooo....... Thanks for all the laughter Sean.
I thought this was a joke….I am heartbroken to hear that Sean has passed.
Absolute legend. We’re miss you mate.
he was so clever ..and i liked him ..rest in peace
god bless to this mans family
What gets me is he'd sometimes have Jimmy in hysterics, literally crying. You don't get many comedians who can do that to other comedians. RIP you Legend.
It's been some tough years, but i could always count on Sean to make me laugh no matter how many times i'd heard it before. Thank you
You know, thanks to YouTube I, as an American, and many others got to see his comedy. Thanks channel 4 for this. I don't know if he even knew how far his comedy reached bc of this. But as someone suffering ridiculous depression, watching these clips and old episodes really made me forget my problems for a while. There was no one that encapsulated the dry, sarcastic, and weird British sense of humor like him.
I love him and miss him
Bloody hell.
I am so sad to hear about his passing. I can’t tell you how many times he brought me to tear with his comedy. Loved him on 8 out of 10 cats and countdown.
Hell be sorely missed. RIP
Gutted, I absolutely loved him on cats countdown. To me that's when he was at his best, at ease just showing his talent. RIP Sean.
Rip Sean so many laughs you made the world a better and funny place
Comic genius.  RIP Sean.  Thank you for the laughs.
One of the absolute greatest. Can hear at the end that he obviously had some sort of throat/mouth issue towards the end. Will be profoundly missed.
Remembered for the countless hours of joy and laughter he has bought to the world. God bless him and his salvation.
I laughed and laughed watching this until I got to the end then remembered why I was watching it. A man so funny I forgot he died for a few minutes. What an incredible comic talent. He will be sadly missed. He once said he wanted his ashes scattered in Piers Morgan’s eyes. Let’s hope that is televised. Even in death I can’t stop laughing at him.
So so funny, what a huge loss to comedy. My thoughts are with his family & friends. RIP, a true legend .
Such a devastating day. I never knew Sean and I never even met him but he provided my life with so much joy and so much laughter, I can't help but feel desperately sad at this massive loss. What a kooky character. What a unique bloody genius of comedy. We will continue to laugh with you, Sean. Always. ❤️🍻
Damn, all that laughing and then realizing he's gone.
OMG!! What a sad sad day😭😭😭 He was really funny
Way too young to leave us, no one can beat or replace his quick witted sence of humor.
Don’t think I’d ever cried over a celebrity dying until now
I nearly cried at the end there....
I'm from Spain. I knew about him from these videos on YouTube. What an absolute force of nature, a comedy genius. I am gonna miss you. I really am.  Rest in comedy, Sean.
Such a sad day, the Michael Jackson clotted dream impression had me in stitches, very very funny man, highly entertaining… RIP sir
I just learned of these shows a couple months ago and have been watching does countdown off and on since. Laughing my ass off so hard that I have to pause the videos.  Rip you magnificent bastard
There were still so much more that could of been added to the video. Such as the tiger who went for a pint, that’s a challenging wank, carrot in a box, etc. We’re all so sad you’ve gone Sean and you made everyone laugh. Rest in peace. Thoughts are with your family and friends.💔
World Rectum of the Year finalist, Sean Lock. He’ll be sorely missed.
FUCK I woke up and this video was my first recommendation so devastated been watching countdown vids on repeat over the last 2 years of lockdown love Sean such a big loss
i’ve watched cats does countdown videos on youtube every night for years as they are a huge comfort to me, and sean lock has made me cry with laughter countless times even on my lowest of nights. he was truly a treasure and a brilliant man. my heart has ached all day since i found out the news, i will miss him so so so much. sending love and light to his family, rest in peace sean <3
Massive loss to the world we all loved him Sean will be missed rest in peace my friend
The Mayor of fun. I will miss him.
I was so shocked when I heard this morning about Sean, im devastated that Sean lost his life and for his friends and family. Fuck cancer.
He will be missed immensely.
😢 such a great guy, so sad to hear about his death…
Thank you for the joy and laughter you brought to our lives, May you rest in peace Sean.
Devastated at this news, I will really miss him.
Absolute legend. One of the greatest. Very very funny man. RIP Sean. You’ll keep us laughing for decades to come.
Brilliant comedian and so talented, a huge loss RIP 😢
Great talent lost. Thoughts for his family.
Imagine a social media comments section where everyone is completely aligned and in agreement. It can happen. It just did. And all because of Sean Lock.
sad news , rip sean
Wtf?? He died???
We studied Cats Does Countdown for my media GCSE about 7 years ago, and ever since then Sean Lock was one of the few comedians I'd watch regularly. I've never been more saddened by a celebrity passing away. Thanks for letting me grow up with laughs for the past few years.
I binged watched Sean's stand up shows and 8 out of 10 cats whilst getting clean from opioid addiction. I didn't think it was possible to laugh so much whilst feeling completely lost and sick as hell. Sean along with another couple of other comedians dragged me through that dark time, I really hope they know how much they can really turn somebodies day from the worst day of their lives, to just about bearable, which is at the time more than I could have hoped for. "Nazi Island" made me literally cry with laughter along with Jimmy! When a comedian makes other comedians laugh in the way that he did, you know they are pure gold. R.I.P Sean, thank you for the laughs, I hope one day your family can find some comfort from the absolute joy you brought to our nation. 💖💖💖
Rectum of the year, 🤣🤣🤣 im crying!!
RIP Sean. One of the best!
He was brilliant.
Keeping the tits was just greedy ...  RIP Oldmate , you were unique .
R.I.P
Damn.  That sucks.  RIP .
This is how I found Sean died. His presence on 8oo10c and CatsCountdown helped me through many dark days. He will be missed. ❤
So very sad. I'm sure he's making someone laugh whenever he is.
Gutted 😭
Not sure if this is true what im about to say, but with each clip in this compilation he sounded progressively more unwell. But despite that he still kept on pushing through, and gave me so many laughs. Ill continue to watch his highlights and re runs of his stand up shows. What an absolute legend he was. RIP Sean, you can sleep easy now
Sean what a legend he will be missed RIP
Rest in peace Sean, thanks for the laughs.
Rest in peace Sean
“I beat Fern Cotton……”. I’ve lost it. 😂 RIP Sean.
I'll miss him. Nr. One reason watching 8oo10c(dc).
A true legend, RIP Sean.
Thank you for all the great belly laughs, Sean ❤
I really couldn’t bear the news of Sean’s passing this morning. His humor will be greatly missed.
I was shocked to see on the news Sean had passed away, I didn't even realise he had cancer. Keep them all laughing in heaven. R.I.P ❤
So sad, what an absolute legend!
I’m not usually someone who feels personally affected by the death of someone I don’t know, but Sean’s passing has changed that. What an absolutely brilliant man. Funny without ever punching down, a perfect comedic partner to anyone on his team on Cats as well as a great stand up. Always felt like a fun uncle. RIP. x
Sean was a funny guy 100%. Glad they didn't use his death to push the convid narrative.
He''s an absolute legend, a one off, there's quick witted, and theirs Super Sonic Witted Sean Lock
Now seeing the full meaning of RIP... RIP Boss man🙏🏿
What an awful selection of Sean Lock's best. The man died and you choose some of his weakest material. SMH
Fucking hilarious always 😂rip mate 💔x
RIP Sir Sean Lock.
God damnit. I love Sean. WTF
I was so shocked to hear the news, absolutely shocked, such a funny person, rest in peace man.
So sad. One of my favourite comedians.
I recommend Sean’s Sitcom “15 Storeys High” its absolutely amazing and should be way more popular than it is. I loved Sean’s comedy for quite a while before finding out about it and I binged the whole thing the first time I watched it.
So sorry for his family and friends,  too soon 💜🙏
Loved the moments when he used to laugh at what he was about to say. Only he knew, but we'd all start laughing, knowing that he was about to come out with a belter! I don't think I have laughed so much, after hearing such sad news. Watching so many quality clips, he's a real loss to comedy.
I've been in a bad mood all day since hearing the news of his passing. It's really hit me hard, he will be greatly missed.
So sad.  R.I.P.  Sean Lock
I am still unable to process this tragedy...
ot fair.  Here I am laughing at Sean over breakfast, and then you tell me he passed away…..RIP Sean
rip such a legend
Cancer is the worst thing to be on this earth taking away legends like this Sean lock will be hugely missed 😢 rest in peace you incredible comic
Gutted
RIP Sean Lock,
NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loved this guy
RIP Sean
Comedy genius RIP
RiP you great man 😔😔
I rarely comment, but felt I had to here. RIP Sean. I only discovered you last year, but you've been a huge help to my morale ever since
This video is such a beautiful and tragic way to learn that he died :(
Man, this sucks. Such a tremendous amount of talent just gone. I mean he effortlessly brought comedians to tears with his jokes! He got people whose whole careers revolves around getting people to laugh to break down and literally cry with laughter. Fuck cancer.
Such a talented comedian. Sean will be very greatly missed. My condolences go out to his family and friends at this difficult time.
When he took leave from Cats Does Countdown and returned with a diminished voice for a while, all signs pointed to something being very, very wrong inside.  Lee Mack has written today that it was known that this day was coming.  Stoic, selfless and brave, Sean was just as you'd expect him to be, and kept us laughing right up to the flood of tears.
Absolute legend. Always different to everyone else and never predictable. RIP Sean. 😕♥️🥕 📦
One of the uk's best comedians rip
RIP Sean Lock
What a loss to the world. Very funny guy. 😢
He will he missed so much what a human
Huge fan from America with a broken heart here. Some of the things he came up with off the cuff were my hardest laughs ever.
fkn covid and now this.... Im done.  loved you man
A comedic genius, was so shocked to hear of his passing today 😔 R.I.P Sean, gone far too soon 😥
Comedy genius, underrated but now many people will know what's missing: Sean Lock.
I thought it was a sick joke. Very sad and a great loss. So very funny. You will be missed.
Thanks you for all of the laughs
What a fucking comedic genius Sean was! I'm going to miss the twat.
Damn
RIP  Sean lock , amazing
This doesn't feel real. Sean had such a sense of humour that nobody could match. Utterly distraught that there will be no more
I wish the best for the wife and 2 kids Sean leaves behind.
Such a sad day. I hope his tomb stone reads “ ooooooooonooooooooo whyyyyyyyyyyy noooooooo ahhhhhhjh”
The Sultan of cynicism.  The Duke of deadpan. The Mirza of miserable.  Here’s to you Mr Lock.
His delivery was the best,he made us all smile and laugh when we needed cheering up,you will be greatly missed Sean 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I send my condolences to the Lock Family in their time of grief. May he Rest in Peace and have a nice gig on Stage in the great beyond
Hoping you’ll get above fifteen stories high, you were comedic divination x 🤗😂🥲
In my opinion.. one of the funniest people of all time. I was hoping to see his stand-up one day. He will be missed dearly
Claudia Winkleman sums up watching Sean, you could not breathe for Laughing.. RIP Sean today the world a true comic genius.
I'm gutted. How he wrapped up surreal silly sharp and witty in one joke was genius. A unique talent.  RIP Mr Lock and thank you for the laughter. You will be missed.
Ach Sean, Rest in Peace fella. Rectum of the Year is one of my favourite bits of any comedian and fair play to C4 for including it. Genius.
Rip, good dude. Arguably one of the best dudes.
A ferociously funny fucker, who made me cry with laughter more times than I care to remember... RIP sir
Farewell to the undisputed world carrot in a box champion!
Always made me laugh. Carrot in a box is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I loved watching him crack Jimmy up. Rest in peace.
Gutted about Sean. One of the UK's finest ever comedians. Gone far too soon. R.I.P. undefeated world carrot-in-a-box champion.
Rip ❤️
As an Aussie I only recently found out about 8 out of 10 cars and I loved Sean's humour. The carrot in a box has to be one of the funniest things I've ever seen, no man, other than Sean, could have pulled it off.
I’m so sad to hear this. I’ll miss him on tv. He was so sharp and funny. Bless him. 🌺🌸
Rest in peace, what a guy ✨🌹 he left this earth but with such a legacy behind him
One of the greats, rest easy Sean
There will always be a carrot in his box. Rest In Peace to one of the largest inspirations out there.
Nooooooo... whyyyyyyy.... nooooooo.... aaaaahhhhhh....
Thx for the laughs x
Not all hero’s wear capes. RIP Sean
RIP Sean. We will all miss you xx
Absolute legend. Rest in peace Sean ❤️
RIP, Sean, you were unique and made me laugh so much over the years, you will be missed by so many people, another bright star has gone out in the world of comedy.
We can all celebrate his life by having a drink with Vimto and whelks in it.
Nobody like him before or ever again I think, and it seems he kept working through it for a number of years. RIP to one of the greatest.
This compilation is not long enough. 😥
This man was simply hilarious and a joy to watch. Love to his friends and family.
I very rarely if ever comment on anything but this man has brought me somuch joy over the years , he will be sorely missed. 58 is such a young age…his humour was so different from anyone else’s. I’ve never felt actual grief from a celebrity passing. If “nooooooo, Whyyyyy” is not on his headstone someone’s missed a trick
Miss him already! 😢
This should be much longer! There are so many amazing bits.
I'll have a river water for you mate. 🍻 What a shock to come off night shift and see this as soon as I open up YouTube 😲. The world is sadder without you Sean Lock 😪
Such sad news 😔 Loved watching his brand of comedy on CDC Will be missed by all Thank you Sean.
Anyone else crying and laughing tears of joy and sadness?? 😭 Sean. You are a legend. I hope your pain is gone and you are making the mandem in heaven laugh even more so x RIP x
Can't even believe he's gone!
This Is very upsetting
Legend, absolute legend comic genius - missed but not forgotten 🙏
So very sad to hear of Sean's passing. May he rest in eternal peace. Bless him, he was one of my favourite comedians. He will be sorely missed.
This really sucks, I love him on 8 out of 10 cats and 8 out or 10 cats does count down.  RIP to a truly funny man.
As an American, I didn’t know Sean on anything but from his seat on this show. I didn’t even know his last name until today.   So I guess the only reaction I can give is something as an American I’ve never said before.  “Gutted”.   RIP, man. It seems you were loved by many on your side of the pond. 58 for many comedians is just getting started. I’ll miss you from afar and wonder what if. I hope there are other Americans beside myself who appreciated your uniquely un-American wit and genuine laughter. Your laughs really came from deep within, genuine. Your laughs made me laugh even harder. You’ll be missed.
died on the same day as my nana, same year from the same cause, rest in peace sean, you will be missed x
Part of the comedy soundtrack to my life and I can't believe he's gone. Heaven just got funnier.
Phenomenal man, made us all laugh with tears over the years. Someone who's brought light into times for some that have been very dark. A debt we could never repay to him. And now all we have is tears in honour for him. Thank you Sean ❤
Legend
You'll be dearly missed my man... All I can say is; "nooooooooo....... whyyyyyyy......" The joy you brought will never be forgotten ♥️ give m hell up there... Or down there..
Sean was an incredible talent.  I’m absolutely gutted.
😔🙏 rip Sean
Such a shock to hear of his passing. Such a loss one of the few that makes me  cry laughing
Sean Lock will be hugely missed. 8 out of 10 cats will never be the same
I'm heartbroken.
Please tell me that there are dozens of new Catsdown episodes already taped with Sean as team captain.
Thank you, Sean. Laughter is priceless.
I'm devastated. Like a lot of people here, he has brought me laughs when I've been at my lowest. Rest in peace, legend.
Rest in peace mate🙏🙏
Can't imagine him not sat there with his brilliant one liners. RIP  Hope your having a great time in the sky.
A true comedy great, one of the best out there RIP Sean
I didn’t know Sean Lock the man but I like to feel as though I knew Sean lock through his Comedy, Interviews and I’m crushed but I send my sincere condolences only hope that Sean’s family and friends and those he has become close to can help each other through such an awful time. I will miss his wit, sarcasm and general brilliance but also the way he was always smiling or just about smile if you were willing to wait for the joke to finish! Be at peace Sean you will always be a funny FUNNY Man.
No 😭 RIP
He died doing what he loved - not playing Countdown. RIP to a great one!
“I’m not bothered about being a glass half full or half empty kinda guy … I’m gonna order another drink”  RIP Sean Lock you will be missed immensely!
A comedic genius. Thanks for all the laughs, Sean. God bless 💔
Thank you Sean❤️
Even with the sad news of his passing these clips still made me laugh like a fool. Thanks for all the laughs Sean.
Absolute Legend. RIP Sean.
What a legend rest in peace. Can't believe you cut the seal clubbin, "trolly dash" has me in stitches everytime.
How can 96 people give this a thumbs down???  This shocked me and having watched this montage it's just so saddening to know we'll never hear him riff like that again. Off you go you beautiful man.
Genuinely gave me tears of happiness at my lowest points. RIP you legend
heaven will be full of laughter R.I.P GENIUS
I'm really gonna miss him
"I wouldnt normally with water, but it's so watery, I'll say cheers"  Rest in peace you absolute legend
He stole every show he was on. RIP Sean
The most naturally funny man to ever live.
He never fails to bring me to tears. Today sadly for another reason than usual. He made the world less dark and grim and his legacy will carry that forward.  May his friends and family find the strength to overcome this loss.
Totally gutted by the News.  I will miss Him.
I watched this without realising he just died... So sad..
Remember when he absolutely slated the children from Mitchell brooks primary school when he was on Big fat quiz of the year… he made me laugh so hard… RIP
Thanks for all the laughs. Rest in peace.
A terrible loss. I will miss him so much.
8 out of 10 cats without Sean. That's never going to be the same. From the Netherlands, thank you Sean! You brought many smiles.
Sean who???? Oh another right on Channel 4 bore
RIP Sean. Your amazing humour will be missed.
Devestating loss for humanity. RIP Sean you legend.
I'm sure he had no idea how much he touched people.  Amazed by those who have admitted feeling depression lift because of him.  Laughter is amazing.  And sharing it even virtually, heals.  Thanks, Sean.
Rest in peace Sean. Genius of comedy. Loved seeing him of Cats and other comedy panel shows. Those kids' acting was shit 😭
One of the most gifted comedians I have ever known. RIP Sean, and my deepest condolences to his family and friends. You will be sorely missed. :-(
This is… extremely sad :( Sean was amazing, one of my favorites
I'll laugh a little less now without you. R.I.P Sean. Thanks for all the laughs
Legend
Legend, so sad ❤️ to family friends and fans
Expect lots of rain from now on cos God"s pissing Himself . Thoughts and prayers to the family of this Wonderful Man
No words can say how shocked I am. He was a genuine legend, one of the funniest people on TV. You will be dearly missed.
You could tell he wasn't well in that last clip, but none of us knew how serious it was. I haven't been as gutted about the death of a comedian since Rik Mayall died. Sean was a truly funny man, with an amazing delivery and wit. I will really miss him. RIP
he was such a treasure and will be missed dearly 🥺  rip sean
I hope miles kept that photo that had been in the family for years 😏😒  rip
Way funnier than any one man has any right being. Rest in peace.
Legend
Legend rip
Sean. You were the best. And you will be missed by so many. Thank you for the laughs. X
He will be sorely missed, especially at a time where the medicine we all need is laughter. He will be remembered and celebrated for decades to come as one of Britain’s finest comedians. Thanks for the laughs Sean. Be at peace.
What a comic genius
Making people laugh legend
RIP to an absolute legend
Carrot In A BOX!! RIP
58... To me, that's so young! I thought he was going to continue on more, but this is heartbreaking. Even if I'm not as big of an 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown now as I was back in 2020, it still has a special place in my heart, because it made me laugh so fuckin' hard!   RIP Sean Lock, you comedic legend!   I'm gonna miss you on the shows...
R.I.P sir 💔
Tiger getting pissed is definitely one thing I will remember for ages. His humor was spot on, it won't be the same without him.
I can't believe we lost Sean Lock and Diego Maradona within a year. That said it will really open up the rectum of the year world championships 2022.
Rest in peace Sean. Thank you ❤️
One of my favorites. I’m an American fan of British comedy and television and I always know I’m in for a good laugh when Sean Lock is on the bill. He will be greatly missed.
It's a mad thing, the amount of celebrity deaths there's been in my life time and this is genuinely the only one that's hit me, proper lump in your throat stuff. Great man, great comedian. R.I.P
Gone way to soon that’s for sure
We've lost one of the best comedians of our time. You will be missed Sean. Honestly.
Gutted :'( :'( RIP Sean
Totally unique & unpredictable material that was utterly brilliant !  RIP Sean.
I never write in the comments, but this hurt me so much. Rest In Peace Sean Lock, no one will ever reach your level of genius.
Gutted. Loved the bloke and his style of humour. Far too young.
Thank you, Sean.
I was shocked to hear of Sean Lock’s passing. He was so funny. I almost don’t believe it! I didn’t know he’d been sick actually. Very few of the people around me seem to know who he was, so I need to vent my feelings on the internet!
Wait a minute..what??
Devistated to hear of Sean's passing today.  A great comedian who will be missed by many,  this tribute had me crying with laughter and sadness.  My thoughts go out to his family and friends.  RIP Sean Lock
UGHHHHH!!!! So sad!  RIP, you will be missed!!!  In my best Sean Lock voice 'Well Jimmy, CANCER can go f*** itself'!!!!  FU CANCER!!!!!!!!!!!
When he told his seal clubbing and rectum of the year routine and no one could breathe laughing so much. I'd have loved a pint with the man, loved it. RIP Mate x
Great comedian will leave a big hole. RIP Sean
Rip 😢
What a huge loss to British comedy May you rest in peace Sean lock you bought joy to so many lives 🙏
So Sad, I'll miss his certain brand of humor.
So sad. Only 58.
May his soul rest in peace
What a loss. Never fails to make me belly laugh. Thanks Sean. R.I.P❤️
Very sad, RIP
Rip Sean. I'll miss him. Thanks for leaving so much laughter behind.
I truly cannot believe Sean is gone. Such an incredible comedian. Rest in peace, Sean 💔💔
Why nice people die younger? love you Sean, RIP.
I never realised how unwell he looked until seeing those clips. To still do what he did is a testament to how amazing he was. RIP Sean x
My heart sank when I saw the headline. It’s a tragedy, the world has lost a true one of a kind.  “A comedian’s comedian who took us all by surprise” — Harry Hill  RIP you legend.
Harry hill: “he was the comedians, comedian”
I gasped this morning when I saw the news, Sean Lock was an absolute comedy genius and a lovely guy. I had the pleasure of working with him 4 years ago and it’s now a memory that I cherish!   Cancer really sucks and doesn’t discriminate. I hope his passing isn’t in vain and that this news saves someone’s life.
What an amazing comedian, literally had me in tears. Such a sad loss Rip Sean
Sean Lock was absolute gold.  Incredibly sad news to hear of his loss.
Devastated.
you know an incredible comedian when other people beg them to stop talking. RIP Sean
I only recently started a marathon on the 8/10 Cats and Countdown videos, this news hits so hard now... I will forever laugh at his jokes, he will never be completely gone. Farewell Sean, give the angles above a good laugh now! 🙏🏼❤
Put out your pot of whelks for a comic genius. The 8 out 10 Cats family won't be the same. Generous with his laughter and comedy. Making seal clubbing a comedy masterpiece and playing his part in the best spit joke. R.I.P Mr.Lock
How the fuck could you dislike a video like this
I was brought up around his comedy im only 17 but him and miles in the show never once failed to make me laugh a top bloke forever missed
This hit me harder than most celebrity deaths over the last few years. RIP you grumpy hilarious bastard
I think we’re all a bit grumpier today… which I’m sure you’re loving! RIP Sean, thanks for the laughs!
My all time fave panel show comedian
he will be missed </3 there is no words truely to describe him. RIP Sean ...
Oh no! This is how I’ve just heard this news. Gutted.
What a shitty way to find out. I don't feel like watching this one just yet 😞
One of the best piss takers ever. a favorite.
Rest in peace Sean you will be missed from cats does countdown and thank you for the great laughs over the years been a pleasure watching you
;’(
Man, this genuinely stings; genuinely has me tearing up.
RIP, a true great of the comedy scene, one of our best
Oh! I’m going to miss him so much!…..RIP
R.I.P Sean
Watch this video and I don't know if he just happened to have a cold or something but his voice sounds quite different, a signal hiding in plain sight! He was right though, there's not enough words in a dictionary to describe him. RIP 😪
I'll always think of Sean as the man who made darkness brighter. R.I.P. The world will now always be a bit sadder.
Absolutely devastated at this.
Rest in peace to a true genius who I grew up watching
Noooooooo whyyyyyyyyyyyy! Aaarghhhhhhhhhhhh!  Loved his dry humour, I will forever miss him!💔
There's not many comedians who can make me laugh till I hurt, Sean Lock did it every time.  Absolute genius
Watching this whilst grinning cheek to cheek.  Thanks for the laughs Mr Lock, you were absolutely brilliant. Wish there was more to come. X
An Absolute Legend, as a family we will miss him enormously he brought so much belly aching laughter to our Lounge.
Absolute legend.
Sean lock a comic genius! He had it all fastest wit in British comedy! His absurd comic style was a pleasure to watch! Rest in peace Sean you were loved by us all.
A great bullshitter
Amazing man. RIP.
What a great legacy to leave behind.  I'm shocked to hear he's gone but so glad I got to see his humour.
Sean Lock was the first comedian to play Wembley
He had so much more to give, just so sad we'll never have a new funny moment to laugh to. What a loss, what a wonderful man.
Really sad news. Rest in peace Sean
RIP - cancer is a 4 letter word with a C a U and T as well - took my dad as well . Hugs to the family- thanks for all the laughs
A legend which will be missed, absolute legend, Sean Lock R.I.P
Genuinely outrageous off the cuff funny man. Wish I had a pint in one hand and a cigar in the other to toast him. But i don't drink or smoke so, well done Sean God bless you. I'm holding up a Yorkshire terrier in one hand and TV remote in the other.
How on earth have people left disklikes, twats.
Rest in Peace Sean. Rest in peace.
Very sad day for comedy!! Lost a legend
a sad summers day.....                                                                                                                                                and the weather was shit too.
everybody needs to start filming dolphins now because i for one want to see him ruin their reputation, R.I.P , to an absolute legend, you will be missed
What sort of twat down votes this?
This is sad :(
❤️
R.I.P you absolutely legendary Bloke
OH NO WHAT HAPPENED?! awww man. what a loss.
Thank you Sean
The actual sight of 93 people disliking this video is sickening . I watched my father slowly die from cancer and I wish no one to go through that pain . If you dislike this video,  you know nothing of pain . RIP Sean lock
<3
Such a great. RIP Sean <3
You got me through some of the most depressing years of my life with your comedy.  Rest in peace you legend. You was taken too soon <3
Carrot in a box champ 🏆
Sean was a great man, a great comedian and a great laugh, RIP
“The Comedians Comedian” - Harry Hill.   RIP Sean Lock.
Just cant drop the feeling that this is all a dream. What a fantastic comic and a fantastic human.  Im deeply saddened with his passing, may he rest in peace. Condolences to his friends and family To the true champion of “Carrot In a Box” Miss you already
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! What is going on with this year man. Why Sean, RIP Sean. Heaven has now received another great comedian  may we still be laughing in your favour. We are left with so many phrases, you can never forget the "google can go f**k it's self" and the total comedy.
genius
Loved this guy, 1 of a kind doesn't do him justice
Ughhhhh..... comedy legend. Making people laugh wherever he is now. I bow my head to you sir. Thanks for making us feel lighter and having so much fun with you.
In the next life beating all challengers to Carrot in a Box
Holy shit rip Sean lock I thought this was a troll
Oh no! How did he die!? Love him!
Thank you Sean for all the laughs.
RIP Sean , had so many laughs over the years. Thank you!
Love that boy. Gonna miss you, buddy.
I laughed so much until the end; where it just said RIP, then all of a sudden, I was so so sad.  Such a funny guy.  To make other comedians literally cry with laughter is such a big feat.  I was watching clips of him this morning while in a waiting room before the news broke.  He’ll be missed.  Thoughts are with his family,
How can you watch this amazing tribute to such an amazing man who brought tears of laughter and joy to so many people and not like the video.  RIP a true comedy legend
Great clips. Sad news. Thanks Sean. Goodbye fella.
Does anyone know the episode where he talks about being the heir to the Birds Custard company?
What a king. RIP, you will be missed.
The only one on 8 out of 10 cats that was consistently the funniest. One in a million.
Sean always reminded me of my father. Especially now that he's dead.
A truly unassuming, genuinely funny bloke. What made him different, I think, is that he always gave you the impression that he would be happy sitting beside you in the pub having a laugh. RIP Sean.
I was halfway watching this video laughing my ass off before I realized it was a tribute :( Absolutely hilarious! The show won’t be the same without you!!!! You will be missed
First celebrity death that has affected me like this. Can’t stop thinking about it. This man never failed to make me happy, even when I was my saddest. The world has lost an absolute legend. RIP Sean ❤️
Well done for Channel 4 putting this together. The work he did on  8 out of 10, was great, the big fat quiz comments on the kids acting was brilliant. I always looked forward in anticipation of what he was going to say in each show he was on. His fellow contestants always looked horrified at what he said and then would fall about laughing. I think Miles Jupp and Sean were great together.  Truely a great  comedian he will be missed. Best wishes and condolences to his family,  please know we really appreciated him and luckily we will be able to laugh along with him for years to come.
I will miss this utterly brilliant man making me laugh uncontrollably. His very unique brand of comedy that will never be carried and delivered by anyone now or in the future. Rest in peace sir 😢
Rest in peace
Can’t believe it, he brought many smiles and laughs to us all, what a legend. Will sadly miss you, RIP Sean, my heart goes out to his family and friends ❤️❤️
He was such a funny man... RIP
A truly clever comedian.  So glad he left such a legacy. Much love to his family.  RiP
Omg, when did he die? I just met that show and I love it, and I loved him. So so sad this has happened.
I still cry with laughter when I watch the Bring all the Nazi's back for "Nazi Island" What a terrible loss
Sean always made me smile. From the carrot in the box, to the countless times he made the audience laugh. Rest in Peace.
He will be missed Rip Sean 🙏x
FUCK. What a bloody legend. He will be missed.
A great selection!
RIP to an absolute legend. Brought smiles to so many people with your unbelievable personality and humour. You will be missed greatly.
One of my favourite things about Cats was just watching other people react to Sean. So many respectful laughs from other comics and just fucking bewildered ones from misc celebrities. This guy's an English legend for just how UNANIMOUS the love for his comedy was. Also did a pretty fucking good job of at least always seeming like he'd stayed down Earth.
Gutted.....but what a human being and his footprint is indelible. Thoughts to all his friends and family....I can't imagine your pain but now you know how much Sean was loved x
Rest in peace💔 Will always remember this comedic genius🕊
Legend, such a funny man. RIP sean 🙌
Comic genius!!! R I P Sean Lock :(
Fookin hell ehat a loss.  sean will be looking to file a complaint up there.. 58- rotten luck
He was awesome, rest in paradise ❤️
"15 Storeys High" - 2 seasons, 12 episodes of one of the greatest comedy productions of all time.
I am also 58, so so sad. That I am still here and he isn't. Where's the justice. RIP Sean.
Thank you for making me laugh RIP
Being from Sweden I´ve only seen the clips on Youtube from mainly the countdown-serie. I fell in love with Sean´s humor from there and have seen the clips multiple times. The Google-joke, sealclubbing, difficult wank, carrot-in-a-box, spit on Miles-joke and many, many more have made me laugh again and again. You will be deeply missed.
The man, the myth, the legend - rip Sean Lock 💙
legend
A truly brilliant man, brilliant talent, and he'll be greatly missed.
Rest in peace sean, you never failed to make me laugh
HOLY SHIT WHAT???? Oh my God, this one hurts.
The fact that he was so ill but was able to keep it a private matter just shows what a great group of family and friends he had around him, thoughts are with them, he’ll be so very missed
So so sad what a legend a naturally funny guy taken way to early 😢 thoughts are with your family and friends r.i.p 😪💔🙏
Just lovely. I like how rectum of the year made Claudia's eyes water.
RIP to a true legend of comedy ❤️
Only yesterday I was looking up, watching and laughing at some of Sean's Youtube videos and now I hear he's passed away... For me his videos have been a 'GO TO'  source for laughter for years... I'm Gutted :(  *"R.I.P MR.LOCK"*
Absolute belly laughs from this man over the years. He will definitely be missed. RIP
Legend RIP
Missing you already Sean, rest in peace mate.
R.I.P Sean, I can't believe you're gone may your humour live forever, Sean's death has legitimately gotten to me in a way I can't describe and my heart goes out to his family & friends at this difficult time "google can go fuck itself"
Keep seal clubbing. Rip.
Very sad. RIP He saved my life once, i lived across the world and never met him, but he made me laugh at just the right time.
One of the few who could actually bring tears to my eyes with such quick witted humour. We’ve lost a good one
He MADE 8 outta ten cats does Countdown.  RIP Sean.  One of the funniest men ever
Sean Lock and Rik Mayal are huge loses to comedy, not just British comedy but comedy in general. Far too young to leave us.
fuck no...not him wtf man..damn it
A fearless and bold comedian, Nazi Island anyone? Never failed to make me laugh. RIP Sean, commiserations to your family, friends, and fans.
He effortlessly upstaged everyone on Cats Countdown. His stand-up DVDs were wildly original and absolutely hilarious. And he was a comic genius of sitcom writing, as 15 Storeys High demonstrated. We’re all gonna miss him so much. RIP Sean Lock.
RIP Sean Lock, one of the finest comedians Britain has ever seen. He will be missed.
💔
The positive outpouring to this man is just a testament to how loved he was. Thinking of his family and friends who have lost an absolute hero today. RIP Sean, you great great man

I cant describe how much I wanna cry
Whatttttt?!? Shit, this sucks. So damn funny on this show.
"I'll not spit on you when we have sex tonight"   -Sean lock
Never failed to make me laugh. What a loss 🧡
Been a fan since he performed in Live at Apollo in 2007. 8 of 10 cats, Countdown spin-off. Big Fat Quiz, QI. So many great performances whenever Sean was around. Sean Locks "biggest achievement in life" is my absolute favorite along with "carrot in a box". He had so much wittiness, humour and funny quick responses. He left me in tears (laughing) many times. Thank you, Sean, for all those years of generating positive energy. You will be dearly missed.
RIP in bloody legend
I'm just wanna cry
rip John! 😢😢😢
Sean was the finest comedian. May he Rest His soul.
RIP funny man!  You will be missed.
Comedy legend,  thank you Sean.  RIP
Oh hell no,is this true,what a blow to real comedy,fucking torn up by this news,rest in peace sean
So sad. Brave comedian, effortlessly going against the tide and currents of the day
There are few people who actually deserve the title "legend". Sean Lock was one of them. May he rest easy 🙏🏻❤️
Watch and laugh even James Cordon was a spectator 👍
Still doesn't seem real :(
RIP😣😣
A comedy legend
<3
RIP Sean, you brought laughter into our lives and humor into our souls. You will be missed dearly. The world is a lesser place without you in it. 😪
RIP Sean Lock. What a legend
What a funny, funny comedian! He will be so missed 😌
Rip trully loved him on 8 out of 10 cats, such a funny natural comedian😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Panel shows won't be the same without him from 8 out of ten cats to QI... The man is a comedy legend
thanks for the laughs. I will remember Sean as one of the best comedians of my time.
Amazing sense of humour and brilliant comedian. One of my favourites. This hit hard. RIP
You made me shed a tear so many times with your beautiful mind. Now i shed my final tear for you. Thank you Sean Lock. You made this ugly world brighter. Rest in Peace.
Rip to a king 👑 known by so many and not seen by enough! Legend will always be in our minds
Rip Sean ,, comedy legend ,, he will live on for hundreds of years through clips like these
This video was a challenging wank.
RIP
His ability to compute so quickly, was in my view a true sign of a genius, funny people's brains work in magical ways, offering funny lines and observations, he was absolutely brilliant and his family can be so proud of what happiness he brought to millions He made me laugh and will still make me laugh at his view of the world and use of words and language A true genius and taken way too early Good night Mr L
This one hurt. Used to watch 8out10 with Mum and she passed recently. He made us genuinely laugh. Cheers Sean, look after her up there 🙏
Thanks for every laugh you gave us. You will be missed.
RIP. One of the finest British comics there was.
This is heartbreaking
RIP Sean.🌟 One of the funniest comedians i've had the absolute pleasure to watch. He genuinely came across with a sense of humour that you know was him in real life too, you just can't script that kind of funny. So sad he's gone. Condolences to his family.🌻
Bravo sir 👏🏻
RIP buddy
What a absolute fucking legend rip bro
“Or what about that time I went seal clubbing?”  I can’t believe that line was missed out on this reel 🤣
One of the best ❤️
Found out through this video that Sean died, don’t think I’ve ever went from laughter to complete devastation so quick. As a Dutch lover of most British gameshows I can honestly say no one has made me laugh harder than Sean has, I’ve watched every clip of him (and others) countless of times and every single time he managed to make me laugh so loud, even though I knew exactly what was coming. Dear Sean you will be missed tremendously, and I feel a tiny bit better knowing that wherever you are now, that place will now be a lot funnier. :(
RIP The mayor of fun.
10 out of 10 cats will miss this wonderful crazy man
I’m gonna miss him so much. He was one of those comedians that could have me laughing so hard I thought I would pass out! Absolutely gutted. RIP Sean Lock, thank you for the laugher.
This man made me and millions of others laugh so hard, so many times. Thanks to the Internet he will continue to do so even though he's gone.
That’s a challenging wank 😂 gonna miss this guy
Rest in Peace
He was hilarious and unique, a really original personality. A sad loss to the world.
R.I.P Sean thank you for making me pmsl on those shit nights when I needed a laugh ... you will be missed!
a true comedy genius, a genuine nice guy, you will be sorely missed. thankyou for the pleasure and joy you gave to so many <3
Seeing as you're sitting on a truckload of Sean Lock clips from different shows, would it be possible for Channel 4 to make a long video just with Sean? Talking more than an hour or so long of a video! Would truly appreciate something awesome like that. Rest in peace Sean, you beautiful, weird, dry witted, intelligent man.
I cannot wait for the left to bring up his past jokes to destroy his character in death in the coming weeks.
Rip to a true legend
Thank you all the laughs Sean.  The world is a less funny place now you are not here,  RIP.
Oh my goodness, I had no idea. May he rest in peace -- he will be sorely missed.
In stitches throughout this clip. What a wonderful tribute. Just so sad losing someone who was young. Comedy has lost one of the best comedians.  “You can’t write tears Jimmy”. You are absolutely right Sean.
I hosted his daughters birthday party and he was a really nice man, friendly and caring. Tipped me too for a service I feel I could have improved on as I was new to the job.
So sorry to hear about his passing... he was brilliant..
RIP Sean - you've made me laugh over the years and that is priceless....
Heartbreaking news.
God we are going to miss him. RIP Sean you magnificent bastard.
I'm really going to miss this guy, Made me laugh countless times, such a legend, Carrot in a box is one of my favourite Sean Lock moment, Makes me laugh everytime
RIP true legend
Such a legend! RIP... when I smell hot tarmac, I will think of him
I hope his obituary says Noooooooo Whyyyyyy Noooooo Aaaaaaaahh.  RIP Sean, you will be missed.
LOVED Sean , he was such a wonderful funny man , thanks for all the years of tearful laughter , you were one in a million mate , you'll be very much missed , R.I.P. 😢💔
Oh no... No more 'Carrot in a Box'...Thanks Sean for the 1st 2 parts
RIP Sean Lock, he was truly brilliant and will be missed. x
Legend ❤️
Sorry I never got to tell you I love you 😔
Devastating news RIP Mr Lock.
I hope he realises how much joy he brought to us
"That's a challenging wank"
What a wonderful comedian and person. Rest in peace.
RIP<\3
Rest in Peace Kind Sir.  You will be forever missed.  Kind Sir, Rest in Peace.
I've Seen Sean live and it was an hour and a half of pure gold . The tickets were like £21 !!! I couldn't believe my fave comedian making  his work so affordable. It feels like a mate has died. I think he will now get the recognition he deserves as one of Britain's best ever comedians.  Rest in peace pal.
Amazing man, gone too soon, will miss your comedy. RIP Sean :`(
you could hear his voice deteriorate during the last few years of his tv appearances but never imagined you would leave so young. I’m extremely saddened to hear of his passing. such a tragic loss, he was truly an elite comedian.
RIP Sean. Still can’t get my head around it. One of the few comedians to really make me laugh
Just cannot believe it.  Don't want to believe it is true. Thank you for so many great comic moments.   You leave behind such a void. So many never came close to you. Comic royalty.  I will continue to watch your clips and chuckle along with you as most scenes get too much and you could not keep a straight face. Shine bright in the heavens for us all to see.  Thanks for the tears of laughter.   You won't be forgotten Sean!
You will be missed Sean Lock the funniest man in world.
Sad sad day. What a guy. 😭
What a legend! Rip
undefeated carrot in a box champion, truly missed
Thursday night is Countdown night here in New Zealand. Rest easy Mr Lock
The world is a bit sadder today. You made us laugh like no other comedian, thoughts to friends and family. Absolutely shocked, says a lot about the man that the general public didn't know of his illness. x
Shocked and stunned to hear the sad news. Sincere condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.
Top bloke 👍🏻🇬🇧
I hope I never meet the people who disliked this video
Wait? He died?????
RIP Sean
The man gave happiness and laughter to us all. He made even the worst days better with his amazing jokes. He will always be remembered for the joy he gave us all. No better way to be remembered. RIP to an absolute legend. Look forward to hearing your jokes again when I see ya next. Xxx
I’m quite a miserable person and he was the only one that would make me laugh uncontrollably for hours, he had an a amazing sense of humour, will miss him greatly
R.I.P Sean. You will forever live on in our hearts and YouTube <3
... I just realized this after I watched the video... I cannot believe it... Devastated...
Genuinely shocked and saddened… so sorry for his family x
RIP
I was so saddened to learn of Sean's passing today, you will be terribly missed sir. My sincere condolences go out to your family and close friends. R.I.P.
He was quick witted and sharp as a knife absolute legend RIP 🙏  Sean Lock kind Sir! I often wonderd why he was not seen on TV Recently 2020/2021 8 out of 10 cats now we all know why!!!
Carrot in a box world champion! He is one of those who you just can’t believe is gone…
... God, this hurts. Comedy has lost its greatest today.
❤️
Sean died? No! RIP , from 🇨🇦
So unfair, fuck cancer 😫
I am an American, and Sean Lock has been part of my introduction to British comedy over the past few years. I am saddened to hear of his passing and wish his family and friends peace.
Genius ❤️❤️
Sean brought so much laughter into my life. Thank you, Sean!
Absolutely iconic, thankyou for all the laughs over the years Sean. May you rest in peace and know we will never forget you. Too many hilarious moments to count.
Irreplaceable. Fantastic comic
💔💔💔💔
Thankyou so much for the endless laughs Sean. You will be missed by millions. Many condolences to Sean’s family and friends. A comedy genius has been lost today. RIP Sean Lock.
Sean would not like all the sadness that THE WORLD feels right now.  So, what I have to say is...  ...You shouldn't have eaten all those WHELKS!  "Jimmy : Sean you are going to be VERY sick !"      It was funnier when I thought about it a few hours ago... I am still sad.
WHAT? hes gone :(. What a loss of man. :(
Goodbye Sean ❤️
Not sure how they’re going to replace him.,
It doesn't matter who you invite into your house, a plumber, a decorator, a carpet fitter, you have to have faith in their abilities. When Sean came into my house, through my TV screen, I knew I was in safe hands and that he would make me laugh.
A sad day, thanks for the laughs, RIP.
Rest In Peace.
God bless you Sean. Loved his sarcasm, wit and humour. Taken away too soon. My condolences, thoughts and prayers to his family. X
A remarkably normal looking chap  ( on the outside ) , disguising , perfectly , that he was utterly fucking funny ,  surreal ,  absurd , inventive and one-off phenomena . Unforgettable . Much love and thanks Sean xxxxxxxx
This one is a real sting 😭😭😭 I truly am upset
Well done, Channel 4. And Sean ... oh GOD, how we'll miss you.
Cancer is so shitty. RIP man you were amazing
Susie Dent said it best “I wish I had the words to describe the exceptional man that was Sean Lock. But today I don’t, and I think he might have liked it that way.” He will be sorely missed
To his family... you should be so proud.... Sean has given us so much....a true comedy legend. Absolutely gutted x
Legend
❤️ RIP you comedy legend, already so sorely missed
R.I.P 😢❤️
R.I.P. Sean. Very funny guy
The Messi of comedy. Absolute legend of laughs. “That makes for a challenging wank”. The carrot in a box. Such a list of laughs. RIP Sean.
Who dislikes a video about a guy that the only he’s ever done is make people laugh?!  Honestly there is something wrong with the world. RIP mate
My fave was the stuffed weasel pen! Claude x
So shocked to hear about his passing.  Really shocked.  RIP Sean
His stories always came so far out of left field and would have me in tears.. one of the greats and will be sadly missed 🥲
My own father passed way from cancer at 56. Really feel for his family, it's a pretty huge loss.
RIP legend. One of the most underrated comedians
What a legend that man was !!!
Legend
He DIED?! When did that happen?! *googles* Fuck, 2021 really doesn't want to be outdone by last year.
This man will go down in history as one of the greats! He shall be missed greatly
RIP to one of the greats!! Gonna miss you Sean!
this was a shock
So sad! R.I.P  Sean xxx
So sad to hear this. Such a funny man, enjoyed watching him over the years.
Rest in Peace Sean! Thank you for all the laughs!
May you rest in peace you absolute legend x
What a great comedian he was. Truly unique. He will be greatly missed.
Always made me laugh, rip
Thanks from America for bringing everyone so much laughter. You will be missed.
When my little sister messaged me saying he passed away from cancer, I knew it was true, but at the same time I wanted it to be a terrible joke. Cuz shes rubbish at telling jokes.  Googled it for myself. Felt sorry for his wife and kids, it's horrible being a single parent. But I guess Im just happy that I used to watch this guy on 8 out of ten cats & count down, when he was still alive, years ago. I used to think he was a lot older, because I could see he would get slightly upset when someone made a joke abiut him dying, this was years ago btw. Today I read he had skin cancer before and I'm guessing it took his life this time round.    He was my favourite comedian, because he always looked like he didnt give a damn. It's really hard hearing that someone you admire is no longer here. Wishing his family all the best.
RIP Sean Lock what a legend
Probably one of the funniest people to ever walk the planet. I’m always in stitches with this guy, always. RIP
Sean defined comedy for me, and inspired me through many a hard time. I’m so sad to learn of his passing, but I know he’ll be making people’s lives better for decades, like he did mine.   Thank you Sean, for everything
RIP Sean Locke. Thank you for all the laughs
Nice compilation. It was a challenging wank.
Rest easy you absolut legend. Thank you for all those laughters!
Genuinely saddened by Sean's passing. RIP fella you will be missed
Gonna miss seeing this man on my tv he is a legend of comedy! 😞 RIP Sean Lock❤️
Gutted ! Such a funny man
RIP Sean you bloody legend
Devastating news today. The guy was so dry & very clever. Rest easy fella x
When I heard the news earlier today It made me in such disbelief. I'm completely taken by this, thank you Sean for the joy and cheer you've brought to this world.  My thoughts are with your family at this time, Rip friend
It’s one thing to make people laugh it’s a true comic genius that also has other comedians crying with laughter  Rest in peace Sean
I just knew about his death from this video and i'm so heart broken. RIP Sean, thanks for the good times mate :(
RIP Sean Lock .
Sean Lock made me laugh when I needed it most. Any time I am feeling down I literally search sean lock best bits or something and I laugh every time, and be totally distracted from the world. My heart breaks for his family and his friends
Not the first time I've watched sean and been both crying and laughing. This time is a bit different though. Farewell sir
Talk about a roller-coaster... As the video ended I was thing god I love this brilliant man. For then to learn that he passed away. I'm left heartbroken.
Rest in peace Sean, We will miss you mate.

I'm in absolute shock at Sean's passing. He was pure brilliance.

I never do this, but we're talking about the legend Sean Lock. Rest in peace boy, you were, and still are amazing.  Sad that there will not be any more of Sean & Miles combo :(
Rest in peace Sean, thank you for the laughs all these years.
Who’s going to agree not to spit on Miles during sex now? 😢
So shocked to hear of his passing.  He was a wonderful comedian. One of the few that truly made me laugh out loud.
RIP Sean...you were such a funny guy ❤

An absolute brilliantly funny chap. Thanks for the laughs mate!
He's not gone just left in a taxi with Pavel.
Rest In Peace
The world has lost one of the funniest persons in history
A very sad day … RIP Sean .. I will miss you.
Blimey. Sad day. Funny funny man 🥰
This man has given me tummy and face pains for years. Massive loss
His best moment for me was calling out those kids for their shit acting 😁
I haven't stopped crying -I can't stop. you made me howl with laughter when I was trying so hard to not end my own life....i'll be eternally grateful for your existence
“That’s a challenging wank”. Will miss his humour… gone but not forgotten
Sean Lock, RIP. My sincere, honest, condolences to all his family, friends, etc etc. I could never pick a funniest moment of Sean’s. But his rant about “The Tate Worm” with Bob Mortimer had me in tears of laughter, time and time again. But I’m still in shock. I mean, so out-of-the blue. WTF happened??? Am I dreaming this, for real???
Legend!!! Never thought I would be affected in this way.
Sean will be sorely missed 😢😢
Bless him
Etched in comedy history. Thank you for every laugh, Sean. RIP.
Rest in peace Sean😞
Take a bow.  Legend.
‘15 Storeys High’....the greatest unsung British sitcom
Thanks for the laughs.  You will be sorely missed. 😔
Thank you for making a tribute to Sean Lock... but it’s bittersweet, because it’s the last video I’d ever want to see under his name. 💔
R.I.P Carrot in the box Champion
Incredibly iconic comedian
The next time I drive past hot tarmac next to the vets, or see the first bluebell of spring, or come home to a full mouse trap, I'll remember this man.
In tears right now, brilliant comedian, I remember when he was on QI and pretended something was pulling him under the desk, he will be sadly missed, RIP Sean Locke, 🙏👍
So glad I saw him live several times. So sharp and clever. 15 storeys high was genius too. I can't hear the word "challenging" without smirking now. Thank you Sean.
So sad
Cried when i saw thise today one of my favourite if not the favourite comedian always made me laugh   RIP Sean Lock
RIP
Magnificent comic, there really is noone else quite like him. This is really a gutting loss.
The absolute Undisputed KING of British TV , RIP , You absolute magnificent legend
Devastated when I heard, one of my favourite comedians, RIP
So sad he has passed, excellent comedian!...RIP Sean!
Comic genius. Rest In Peace from one of your many fans stateside!
When another comedian made Sean laugh everyone in the room laughed harder because of that.  Thats how respected Sean is. Am so sad today. RIP.
We all knew something was wrong with Sean. It was expected but no less sad.  One in a million comedian. The panel show industry will forever be worse off without you. Rest in peace.
So sorry to hear this news today my heart goes out to his family and friends. A comic genius who has made me and countless laugh Rest In Peace gone but not at all forgotten 😔
I'm truly shocked and sad end by this news. One of my all time favourites , and a true loss in a time where we all need a laugh.
I was just watching Sean Lock clips yesterday.....I'm 😯,  A remarkable comedian with a quick wit and amazing personality  He will be missed 🥺
THIS COMING UP ON MY RECs IS HOW I FOUND OUT  D'''''''''''''''''''':
such a shame he's gone
RIP ❤️
Sean has definitely cracked the best joke ever, which was the challenge to take a wank to a breaded Rachel. Jimmy Carrs Glory hole unnecessary joke comes a solid number 4.  RIP Sir Sean.
Fuck cancer. RIP to one of the greatest.
Nazi Island!!
Thank you Sean
In Pace Requiescat.
Heartbreaking news. He has been making me howl with laughter for such a long time and was always looking forward to seeing whatever he was on. RIP.
Thank-you so much for making me laugh so hard so often, Sean. I'll treasure that gift.
To the people who disliked this guess you never got a joke in your lives.
You can tell how loved he was. Look at the like to dislike ratio. Will miss how much he made me smile. Sleep easy Sean x
R.I.P…. Such a funny guy
Absolutely tragic.
Miss him already
What a great talent we've lost. Rest in peace.
It was like a trolley-dash....
He will forever be missed x
Loved this guy ! One of the best comedians in the UK, you will be missed 🥲 RIP Sean lock
Love this man
Honestly … always felt sad when celebs die.. people in general.. but for once this one hit me.. people die everyday but this was .. unexpected and very hard hitting
Robin Williams
Heartbreaking. Literally speaking about him at work on sunday. What a guy. Rip
American here. I'm a huge fan of BritComs and British game shows so I'm absolutely crestfallen to hear this news! What an incredibly clever and hilariously witty guy. He was far too young to be taken. RIP Mr. Lock. Your fans worldwide will miss you terribly.

Miss you man
RIP Sean. One of the best

He was brilliant. Will miss him
Rest in peace my man! Complete legend!
Absolute legend. I watch his videos to cheer me up.
This one really hit me. I'm in bits watching this. RIP
Comedy had lost one of the all time greats.
Being in the US, we don't have these shows. Sean Lock got me hooked on British TV shows. I gasped when I saw the RIP at the end. I didn't know he passed. I was thinking to myself last night that it would be hilarious to see him and James Acaster going at it. I guess we'll never know.  Condolences from the US. He IS a legend.
A genuinely funny man.
RIP Sean
One the greatest comedians ever RIP
Fearn cotton.....utter genius
Heartbroken. A fantastic comedian. Truly talented. My condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.
This is the first time I've seen and heard Sean, he is absolutely class 😆
Paying my respects from Mexico. You’ll live forever in our hearts Carrot in a Box Champion!!!
Valé to a great comedian.

If you want to get a tapeworm eat some pork If you want to get a tapeworm eat some pork Lamb chicken beef, fish or egg Forget it you wont get a tapeworm
RIP Sean Lock - Comedic Legend.
One of my all time favourites, thanks for the laughs - RIP
:-)
I really hope they print and make available to buy, as a tribute, Sean’s classic children’s books The Tiger That Went For A Pint and Cyril The Screw. RIP Mr Lock
Who on earth is downvoting this… what a comedian RIP
Carrot in a box, rectum of the year his Michael Jackson impersonation years ago that had James Cordon in tears. RIP you legend. I hope your enjoying an ice cold can of water up there now having a laugh with the greats.
RIP
Many a time I've sat in the living room crying with laughter in a Friday evening watching Sean Lock. Friday evenings won't be the same RIP Sean
Who in their right minds would give this a thumbs down. Will be missed…
Such a tragedy. I so admire how he continued to work, perform and make others laugh even while quietly battling such a horrid disease!
I love you Sean. Always. You've inspired giggles, belly laughs, and straight out tears of joy even in times when things were really tough and bleak. I got lost in your humour, in moments that you created.  Thank you. ❤❤❤.
Noooooooooooooooooooooo whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy noooooooooooooooooooooo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Comedic genius thanks for the gut aching laughs Sean LOCK RIP
Quite simply just a class act R.I.P Sean Lock 🙏

He made every show worth watching! RIP
Rip❤️
Had no idea he passed, was hoping for more laughs from him for years to come. Rest in peace Sean you're a legend
We are eternally grateful for every single thing he did for us. One of the absolute best comedians of all time. You will be missed more than you would ever imagine 💔
In honor of the man, I will be shutting my house down fully this evening. Removing all lightbulbs, turning off the stopcock, etc. Tomorrow I will wake and hope this was a bad dream.
He was a wonderful comedian and I will always remember how he made me laugh until I cried ♥ Brilliant comedic timing ♥♥  Condolences to his family & friends, gone to young :-(
A tremendous man. RIP Sean.
Superstar
Can the FA actually let them wear ugg boots and capes in honour of Sean Lock🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Jimmy carr lvs sean lock he'll be hit hardest outta the crew by his death really funny in these shows rip
Literally watch him every night on highlights in bed still as funny as the first time absolute legend....least he can sleep with a smile on his face knowing he is undefeated champ of carrot in a box ! RIP
RIP our favorite undefeated Carrot in a Box champion
Goodbye.
Jeremy Hardy, Linda Smith, Sean Lock - not exactly similar comics, but all stolen from us at a too-young age.  Proof life is no WIP.  RIP, Sean and your much-missed colleagues.
Wicked sense of humor and unbelievably funny. RIP
A genius that will be missed. He knew how to read a room and play it for an incredible laugh. The only light I can see is that we live in the era of the internet and can relive his brilliance as much as we like!
Well that was a challenging wank.
He was a legend. Absolutely devastated at his passing. The world of comedy has lost a star.
Sean was brilliant. RIP
So saddened to hear of his untimely death.  My condolences to his family and friends.
Love grumpy Sean, going to be much missed. RIP Sean.
Rip to a real legend ❤️
Rip
Coming home to a full mouse trap.. rip Sean we love you 😘
Rip man. Batman's gonna be pissed when he finds out the riddler is gone.
The only man capable of making Jimmy laugh like a normal human being. An absolute genius of comedy. RIP Sean Lock
I only discovered British panel shows a few months ago, but since then, I absorbed so much of it. It is weird to think that Sean is not there anymore, after Catsdown brought me many months of joy. He was truly outstanding.
😥
You look Sean Lock up on Youtube i hope you find this bloke was an extremely funny man, so sad, RIP Mr Lock
I am torn. I loved him soo much 😢 He's the man who made me fall in love with british comedy. Its such a sad news. Comedy lost one of the great. RIP my King 👑😢
a true legend. rest in peace sean
Absolute brilliant comedian had me in tears so many times, today my tears are for him..RIP Sean..
Man, I was really hoping that was just a poorly worded title. Hate to hear that he passed. His "that's a challenging wank" to Rachel on countdown is one of the funniest things ever said on tv. And who could forget fooling Jon in the carrot in the box game.
r.i.p
RIP
Absolutely gutted to hear of this. My best wishes to all who mourn his passing.
May his beams continue to rule forever.
❤️
Not only a great comedian but an even better magician.  We have lost a legend
Rest in peace, thanks for all the smiles and laughs you gave us. I'm forever grateful.
Undefeated carrot in a box grand master, RIP
True legend. Such a funny man. Love watching his old clips. RIP
Rest in peace Sean Lock 🌟🌟🌟💖💖💖
RIP mate.  Comedy genius
I genuinely thought I had read it wrong when I read the news this morning, he will be greatly missed he was such a talented comedian xxx
How can you make a tribute to this man, which is only 5min long!? If Sean could change one thing about himself, he wouldnt change the front anymore. He would make his tribute longer.
Wow, way too young and so many laughs to give, RIP Sean Lock
8 out of 10 cats is brilliant. Was so shocked to see this on Instagram. I had to search it to make sure it was legit... Deeply saddened by this. Best comedian taken too soon
I am literally tearing up. Very sad news. RIP dear Sean!!
RIP Sean 🙏
RIP Sean. Thank u for the memories.
Sadly missed
The best UK Comic. Never bad press. Never a joke ill received. Great guy, great loss.
He was an absolute genius and incredibly hilarious. He really will be missed x
Always remember, he won rectum of the year and beat Fern Cotton.
Too sad for words 💔
RIP you will be missed
Rest in peace 💚
Undefeated carrot in a box champion
Thank you for all the laughs   ❤️ RIP
RIP Sean. A legend in every sense of the word. Rest easy.
It's an absolute travesty that we've lost such a comedic gem far too soon. RIP Sean, your Michael Jackson opening a tea shop still has me in stitches to this day. Rest easy ❤️
What an mighty blow, very talented funny man rest easy Sean gone but never forgotten.
That's so sad, I'll remember his performance on this show always, RIP you legend 😥.
This is actually painful. RIP Sean 👏👏👏👏👏👏
So gutted. Such a great comedian.
As a Pakistani student living in the UK, I had only just started watching 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and I instantly became a fan of his epic comic timing. He was my favourite in the show. I thoroughly enjoyed his standups as well.   He was spot on when he wrote, "You can't write tears, Jimmy."   RIP Sean, you will be dearly missed.
RIP, you were fucking hilarious and sorely missed
Glad they finished with the last one - laughed so hard I nearly passed out on that the first time. Very funny man who will be missed.
Rest in peace Sean you will be missed
One of the world's most special comedians.
He was a grade A comedian. Such a loss.
R.I.P Sean
Netherlands here  When I was wide awake last night I watched 8 out if 10 cats does countdown, which I only recently , like 2 months or so, discovered on YouTube (no Channel 4 for us over here) . So when I turned to bed just now, I was shocked to learn Sean had died. Feel sorry for his relatives and friends. What a great sense of humor....
Thank you. RIP
Love you mate. I bet God's in stitches listening to you xxx.
Fuck me, what? Is youtube recommendations how I find out news today? RIP Sean
Sad day. In a class of his own. Rest in peace Mr. Lock 😔
Legend
He was one of the best. He will be missed. RIP Mr. Lock. My favourite bits of his were with Miles, together or against each other.
Rest in Peace 🙏
Absolute legend
Still in shock, such a terrible desease  that breaks familys apart R.I.P
Legendary... RIP Sir.
Today is a horrible day. Goodbye Sean. We've definately got a few jokes to remember you by.
Sean we are going to miss you man. Shocked dont know what else to say RIP
very sad loss. A very funny man. R.I.P.
God I loved that guy.  An utter genius and a big whole in life now
Absolutely gutted to have lost Sean. A comedian’s comedian.
RIP Sean. You were truly the greatest.
Wierd, I watched a lot of Youtube videos with him yesterday, and now I found out he's dead.  He was one of the greatest minds in comedy.  Comedy just died a little bit.
I tell you what, I’d buy the Sean Lock aftershave, it’ll sell out 👊🏻 RIP big man ❤️
His bit on the mitchel Hill Primary sch was THE best - Corbin had to be pissing his pants . Rest in Laughs and my deepest sympathy to his family.
RIP you will be mist
“The money i embezzled from RNLI”
Watching this and I'm in tears laughing!! Such a shame he's gone. A great talent! RIP Sean.
Every single comedian that went on this show though they were funny, until Sean opened his mouth then it was, "ohh there's levels to this thing, and hes way, way up there".  R.I.P. you brilliant,  brilliant man.
Thank you.
What sad news. I thought l was imagining it when l glimpsed the title of this in my YouTube feed. RIP Sean.
RIP
“Or that time I went seal clubbing….they said… they said they hadn’t seen anything like it… I had two hammers… 😂😂”
I liked it when he cracked up at Joe's rhyme about naming other people's penis's in a urinal. He was very generous when other comedians were being funny too. Class act class human being..R.I.P Sean x
Rest in peace Sean, you will be missed. Go get that carrots! ♥️
My fav. Always waited for him to speak. I am so sad. Prayers for family and friends
I found out the news from this video. Just awful. The shows and the world won't be the same without him
What f***ing awful news. An absolute legend with the uncanny ability to take you, comedically, somewhere completely unexpected. To reduce Jimmy, Claudia and countless others including myself to tears of laughter was a rare gift indeed.  Gone far too soon but never to be forgotten. Love and respect to those he leaves behind.
he makes humour seem so effortless. damn. forever in our hearts. such a sensation and idea. can smell him everywhere
Thanks for all the laughs - still the undisputed champion of Carrot in a Box. RIP
Such sad news, RIP Friday night's on Channel 4 will never be the same, paul ritter and now Sean locke :(
His passing hit me with a sadness that has lingered all day. In contrast, he has given years of good humoured quick witted comedy and I'm grateful for his existence. Sleep easy Sean and thank you for the laughter my friend.
Goodness this has me gutted 🥺. He was an amazing, gifted guy RIP
i dont normally pay much attention to celebs that die but saw the news about sean and it honeslty hit different. this man was another level of funny. RIP
Absolutely gutted to read this today, made for a very sad afternoon... RIP Sean, gave me the best laughs over the last decade or two!
One of the greatest comedians of all time. He was always my favourite and his jokes helped my get through lockdown   May he rest in peace 🙏
Can’t believe it. Such a massive loss. RIP Legend
Before I nod off every night I watch a bit of 8 out of ten cats/does count down literally for Sean lock, totally wasn't expecting this news when I turned on the radio today. RIP you total legend 🙌
So sad, I didn’t know he was unwell. I loved his wicked sense of humour. God bless his family at this difficult time
So bloody good. What a shame. RIP Sean
I've watched 8 out of 10 cats (the old version about the news) for many years and a long time ago already. I'm Dutch and loved it when Sean and Jon did that specific show.  Sean has an unique approach to his comedy, a vision even. Damn this is sad, I was genuinely shocked as it hit me from left field.
What???? What happened??
What a brilliant comedian, shocking & sad news. RIP Sean
Spent too much time watching these clips and memorising shit he's said, sad da
Absolute legend of the comedy game! You will be missed Sean 😢 and your mascots hahaha
Bowed out the true champion of carrot in a box, 2-0, forever unbeaten 🥕
You know....the Heisenberg phase makes more and more sense now. I'm sure he did cook some stuff. Would be weird if he didn't He will be missed. What a great comedian and surely a great person
Seeing the news come in I felt I lost a source of entertainment, someone I never knew I needed made me laugh when I was down and I don't think anyone can stand to him. Let him rest with the greats ❤
Heartbreaking to hear the passing of a legend. My thoughts are with his friends and family.
😪😓 we'll miss ya lock.
He was the Anti-Noel Edmonds!! I've never heard one person say they like Noel, never heard one person say they didn't like Sean. So long Cowboy.
Comedy won’t be the same without you mate, heartbroken, Here’s to a whole pot of whelks Sean
so so sad.., RIP Sean Lock
🙏🏻
A true legend rest well Sean
Never failed to make me laugh. Truly one of the best comedians. I will miss him.  R.I.P. to an absolute legend
“I want to remake Jurassic Park..but make it safe… I’ll take all their teeth and nails out”
The guy was just funny.  Cats do countdown will never be the same!!!! RIP 🙏
Rip Sean love from Scotland I’m sure your up there taking the piss journey well brother
My condolences to his family, friends and to the ones who's lives have been touched and influenced by him.  A great comedian has left us. A sad day indeed 😓🥀
Damn.. I'm from Egypt and sometimes i can't understand some of the jokes he used to say because of culture difference but i would still laugh because of his delivery and his facial expression.. i used to sleep on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown clips.. he helped me a lot with my depression, i hope his family is ok and rest in peace legend ill never forget you <3
He can go straight in the national treasures box.   A comedy genius.   Rest in peace Sean.
R.I.P Mr Lock, you will be missed pal.
Rip
What a loss such a funny guy RIP x
“To me, shoes are just a barrier between dog shit and my socks.”   Has to be my favorite quote from this comedic genius.  I mourn his passing, and will miss all the deep, genuine laughter that this man gave to me.
why him? why not Russell Brand??
I thought he'd be around forever.  A damn funny and likeable man.
Sean dieing has genuinely saddened me
Absolute comedy genius. Anything on TV with Sean Lock on was guaranteed to be entertaining. There is now a void in Channel 4 comedy panel shows, and tremendous tragic loss to British comedy. 'Rectum of the year'... 'that's a challenging wank'... 'won't spit on Miles Jupp when they're having sex that night' so so funny.  And so so funny again and again and again. I'm fucking gutted. Devastated.  Immensely grateful for his entertainment. And to have seen him live. I'll certainly be cracking a can of 'water' to Sean and saying cheers.
Rest in peace Sean, you made us all laugh with your amazing humour. Thank you.
RIP SEAN
I’ve struggled with depression for years. The fact that Sean made me laugh until I had tears in my eyes was a miracle and I am forever thankful to him. RIP legend Sean Lock.
would not surprise me if he played knock down ginger on the pearly gates just for a laugh. R.I.P Sean
Sean was my absolute favourite, I was so saddened by the news today,  RIP you comedy legend, thoughts with his family x
Let's not shed a tear of sadness, no let's shed many of them in joyous laughter. Going on a Sean Lock binge, gonna get high as fuck and laugh my tits off. RIP Sean Lock
The fact that this video's only 6 minutes long is criminal
Till we meet again, will cherish your jokes it has brought warmth when needed. Great loss, it's easy to make person cry but it's hard to make one cry of laughter and joy he made it happen.
Couldn't believe it when I saw the announcement today,  absolutely gutted that he's gone,  thanks for the great laughs Sean you'll be missed ❤️
May Mr. Lock rest peacefully.  As an American in America, I feel that 8oo10c isn't that well known, but Sean Lock is easily one of the best parts of 8oo10c and their version of Countdown.  He will always have the carrot in his box.
Definition of Sean Lock, He was so left field the Americans had to invent a sport to describe him.
Loved this genius so much have followed him for 30 years will miss his sense of humour so much rest in peace mate
Rest in peace you ruddy Legend. You will be missed. :-(
Rest in Peace. He was one of the greatest Comedians there is. He will be dearly missed.
I will miss that guy...:(
There will never be another comedian like Sean, a true British comic. RIP mate.
Rest in Peace, Carrot in a Box Champion
only ever watched the countdown bcz of Sean  sleep peacefully
He was an absolute legend and is gonna be sorely missed.
RIP Sean
A huge loss, Rest now.
Can’t even watch this without being sad. Gonna miss him on my tv ❤️ RIP Sean
Rest in peace Sean. Thank you for everything.
So funny, so sad,
Such a sad day for British comedy, RIP Sean
such sad news to hear about Sean lock, a great comedian who will be truly missed. R.I.P Sean
Rip Sean, such a unique, mad sense of humour, a great loss to british tv.
Bless that man xx
Such a incredible comic. So many moments of pure comedy gold. His dry comedy epitomises why British comedy is second to none.
Can’t believe he’s gone and they really need to put NOOOOOOOOO AGGHHHH on his grave stone 😂 R.I.P legend
Absolutely sick. What a fucking legend!!!!
I'm absolutely fucking gutted
Whenever I felt I needed a laugh I typed in Sean Lock on yt.  Sean, forever grateful for what you gave me.  RIP <3
He was one of the best just like Rik mayall
Heartbreaking x
What a wonderful man x
RIP
Absolutely gutted. A trully gifted man taken far too early. RIP a true legend.
One of the sharpest wits to ever grace a TV screen. Rest in peace, you wonderful seal clubber x
RIP to a very funny talented man 58 is no age at all 8 out of 10 cats does countdown will never be the same SO SO SAD
Bless..
What a legend, he will be sorely missed!
miss him
A national treasure to UK comedy, this won't be an easy one to get over
Devastated! He would have loved this showreel though - May have been the third time he showed his emotional side. Rest in peace 💔
I thought the title was a joke. Come to find out I was wrong this was heartbreaking. RIP Sean Lock
One of the best to ever do it, a huge loss! RIP
Is it awful that i was still laughing when RIP Sean Lock came up
Thanks for the laughter Sean .. RIP
Devastating.   Heaven's going to have to open a complaints department now.
God bless him
RIP to one of the best comedian's since Billy connelly and Jack dee. The world has lost a great.
A truly great comedian, never fails to get me laughing away.0
I came late to the Sean Lock party, unfortunately; however, it was a bloody good time just the same.  R.I.P. Sean; we hardly knew ye.
Sean Lock was probably the funniest man I've seen I can't believe he died. But I guess it just goes to show you that someone will die everyday you just don't know if it will be you or not.
There are not enough bits and shows online to keep me from missing you...hits fucking hard...RIP
I’m devastated. Not many people can make me laugh to the point of tears but Sean Lock was one of them. RIP
He makes me laugh every time. Love him. He will be missed.
RIP Sean Lock.
Rest in Peace Sean Lock, absolute comedy genius. Will be sadly missed
Absolute genius. Never went too far or was offensive to anyone, just genuinely brilliantly funny. Gutted he’s gone. I’ll be binge watching the old 8 out of 10s now. RIP Sean
I'll never forget the carrot in a box. One of the funniest men ive ever seen.   Rip sean lock.
The unnatural handball exclusively soothe because squid indisputably joke over a real underclothes. warlike, tedious bengal
Such a loss and a ahock, Really going to miss him he was a comedy genius. RIP Sean Dream well pal.
This sucks, a brilliant man with a beautiful mind. R.I.P. Sean, you are already completely missed. 😭😭😭
So, so sad. R.I.P Sean!
Sean Lock. Comical genius. Never will forget this legend. RIP Mr Lock.
What a hero this man was, the true definition of witty! The world has lost a true legend RIP
I first discovered Sean a few years ago on YouTube, and I've been hooked ever since. Though I'm saddened by his passing, I'm thankful I discovered him. He will always make me laugh.
Just sad 😞
Joe Wilkinsons poem will always be my favourite Sean clip because whilst he wasn't the one being funny, his reaction to Joe made the whole thing even funnier.  Many tears have been shed today  but so many more will be shed through the laughter of generations to come when they see these clips and so many more. Thankyou Sean!
Thank you Mr. Lock, thank you very much.
Absolutely devastated
What an absolute comedy legend.
RIP to a legend. Forever grateful for the laughs you've given me.
Very sad.
❤️😢
Sad to lose such a top comedian. Legend.
So brilliantly funny,  RIP
New Zealand tips its hat to a great man.
for me it was the Christmas show taking the piss at the small kids doing the nativity scene.. always cracks me up.. You will be missed. Thoughts and prayers to his family and friends. rip <3
RIP SEAN!  Thanks for the laughs!❤️
Condolences to Sean's family. I feel lucky to have been entertained by him. Absolute legend.
Sean Lock, more than a comedian. An extremely talented person, with the quick whit and humour which made him a pleasure to watch. You’ve earned your rest. You will be missed.
He will definitely be missed.
R.I.P man Thanks for the laughs.
Never failed to make me laugh with that almost dry sense of humour. The sketches with him and miles were top class
God Fucking Dammit. Rest in peace, Sean.
A legend who will be missed.
Absolutely gutted by the news. So many nights I've spent in pain from laughing so hard at his jokes. He will surely be missed.
May he rest in peace
Sean was a sensation as he admitted so. Rest in Peace.
he was indeed a sensation
Always the funniest man in the room
RIP Legend. You'll be dearly missed
R.I.P Sean. A man who said everything the rest hesitated to say. Your humor will be missed.
He was such a lively person. He was so funny and put so much energy to create such an ecstatic atmosphere. Such a sad loss to his family, friends and all the fans that adored him and his work. RIP ♥️
Pure natural talent. Safe travels my friend.
Can they call it 7 out of 10 cats now?
For the decide the cup uniform, I'd go doc Martin's... speedo, and a crop top.....
He once said " I don't even want a funeral. when I die I want to be fly tipped. On a country lane, I like the idea I'll be annoying people even after I've died''
Genuinely gutted, he was hilarious. Huge loss.
Loved his deadpan delivery, it was hilarious. i will miss him, he is such a loss 😔
I didnt even know he had cancer. Really sad! May he rest in peace.
One very funny man and he doesnt even have to try hard....Thanks for the belly aches and tears Sean x
American here who first came across Sean on a Facebook watch ad for your channel, and a clip of him - Carrot in a box. Sean was awesome. I saw this video on my YouTube homepage and was SHOCKED. Incredible loss. So sad.
Rest in Peace Sean, you're an amazing comedian, wish I could have seen you live!
What a great loss, he always made me smile.
one of my favourite comedians, horrible news
I'm not ready to say goodbye! Simply heartbroken. Thank you for all the joy you've given me, Sean.
I'll never forget his first "carrot in a box" trick.. Can't believe he's gone.. Rip..
Effortless.
I cannot believe this  What am I doing with my life
Wow, this is a shock. It also explains why his voice changed and sounded a bit rough a few years ago. Gonna miss him. Cheers for all the laughs mate.
Possibly the funniest guy ever
RIP 🙏🏽🕊
feel so empty today. RIP Sean thanks for all the laughs
Wonder who the unfunny comedian (woman) is furiously ringing their agent Gagging for his seat on the panel show.
Rip Sean.
Thank you Sean Lock... RIP
Rip to a legend
Rest in piece.
The funniest comedian of my life time ,such dry British humour ,rip Sean you will be missed ..
Now, watching these compilations brings me laughter and sadness.

I hope his obituary reads "Noooooooooooo arrrrrrrgghhhh".   Rest in peace to a brilliant all round guy, and a greater comedian.
Laughing and crying for two different reasons ,so many laughs over the years ..rip Sean
Sad news, he made that show his own. Always the star of any show he was on.
Glad to see Channel 4 posting this!
He will be missed. Taken to soon.  R.I.P Sean Lock.
Only discovered Sean in the last 18 months. And boy was he the tonic for boredom during lockdown! Thank you for so many laughs.
Absolute brilliant comedian and person
OMG RIP SEAN LOCK, i cant believe this :(
Absolutely loved him!  He was a class comedian.  Absurd, quick witted and extremely funny
He'd hate this  comments section.
5 minutes and 54 seconds tribute to one of the funniest men ever , now that is funny!! 🤣  Thanks for the tears  of laughter  sean  Rest in peace 😪
Funny lad, he will be missed.
Wtf?! How?
I thought I was having a bad day today, then  I heard the news. RIP dude. I ended my day laughing with a tear in my eye. You will be so remembered...funny as.
Absolutely shocked by his passing. I loved his humour. He stole the show, very subtley, every time he was on.
Funniest comedian ever R.I.P Sean lock 🕊️
Never known a comedian with such a funnily sarcastic and witty sense of humour who could make so many other professional comedians sitting around him LITERALLY cry with laughter. A true comic genius. My favourite word will always be BEAMRULES. RIP you brilliant man
RIP Sean, such a sad loss. Watching these clips, you can see just how clever he was worth his thinking although in the last clip, he didn't sound right at all when you compare it to the start. He was battling something we were all unaware off. Such a sad loss☹️☹️
I was so shocked when I heard the news ... One of the best
What kind of person gives this a thumbs down???
First saw him in wilty RIP
Crying and laughing.
I was so lucky to have come across his works on 8OO10CDC back in 2014 and ever since then, I believe I've watched every single episodes of him, whether it be his panel shows or his stand up shows and I've laughed so hard in every one of those shows, my chest hurts. Today we say goodbye to this legend and hope he can make people laugh in the other side of the world, if that's where people go after they're laid to rest. ❤️
F
Best clip to open on. There’s a lot less humour in the world without him
Will be very missed! RIP
I think he deserves all of his funny moments on the show put together into one long video. RIP
I hope somebody honors him by producing "Nazi Island"
Absolute genius
That's a shame, he was brilliant. A true champion of carrot in the box.
Such shocking, awfully sad news. Sean Lock will be dearly missed. So many laughs given to us.
RIP!! ABSOLUTELY GUTTED!! GREAT BLOKE!
I'm an American who only got to experience Sean's comedy via YT. Thanks to him for sharing his comedy with the world & thoughts & condolences to all he leaves behind 💚🖤💚
Such a legend ! Taken way to soon!
What a guy...! Such a sad loss, RIP Sean Lock
Ah no, what a horrible news!   I don't feel the urge to respond to these type of things often, but this is truly saddening news. What a loss!   Rest in peace Sean, you'll be missed by many!!
What a loss. Rest in Paradise, Sean.
This man was such a brilliant comedian and a wonderful person to boot. I'm going to miss him and seeing him steal the show each and every time.
LETS  MEET  JESUS!!!  Good comedian.
Rest in peace, legend!
so sad to hear this news. tv wont be the same for me now.
I had no idea he had cancer, this was a bit of a shock. Such a shame, he was so funny, R.I.P Sean.
The world has lost one of the few actually funny people in this world, what a man he was, gutted to hear of his passing
Rest in Peace Sean and loads of love to your family and friends at this sad time.  I truly hope there is a heaven because they will be laughter  up there tonight.   Till we all meet again, so gutted you have gone so soon.   Amazing to read the kind comments on here. Take care everyone. Love those close to you and don't sweat the small stuff. 😎👍
British humor personified He'll be remembered
No one has ever made me giggle like Sean Lock. RIP you funny, funny man.
I say ' cheers ' to you, Sean. Thank you for the laughs.
So gutted about his passing, I still can't believe it, we've lost a true comic genius here, you never failed to make me laugh. RIP Sean lock, you will be sorely missed
My heart hurts so much I’m gonna miss you Sean Lock. Gods gonna have many laughs with you up there
So sad to hear this news, what a legend and uniquely normal bloke he was. Made me cry with laughter everytime, RIP Sean.
One of the best to ever do it. UK comedy will never be the same. RIP you absolute legend.
Good bye, Sean, you were a goddamn genius and will always live on!!
Bless his heart. Such a funny guy x
Amazing Man
Rip. Legend.
Rest easy Sean .. Your quick wit remarks and dry humour will be sadly missed … Thoughts and prayers with your family at this sad time …
Loved his dry humour. You will be missed. Loved the video tribute! RIP
Out on his own bless him, sleep well mate...
No one made Jimmy laugh like Sean did.
The worlds a less happy place now you have gone. Missing you already
:( we will miss you Sean
RIP Sean……thanks for all the memories….🥰
Who ever dislikes this video is one sick puppy He was a genius and taken way too early  RIP Sean lock
Comedy genius, such sharp wit. Will miss watching him and proper belly laughing. RIP.
No words… Rest In Peace Sean, thanks for all the laughs ❤️
" It's bloody good mead"
Oh, Sean. I'm going to miss you. Love and love and love to all your family
The fact that it was so hushed that he was even ill, brings the frailty of life to the fore and makes you wonder why someone so relatively young gets taken too early. Especially someone who brings such joy to people and is incredibly talented.
He was such a legend 🧡
Laughing and crying throughout this whole video. RIP
R.i.p to a legend, One of the last truly funny comedians we had in my opinion, so sad hes passed away😭 Fuck 2021
One of those rare comedians who can’t stop being funny. Thank you Sean. Gone far too soon
Probably the last comedian that made me cry laughing, end of an era.
Has Sean Locke passed??
Superb comedic brain and came across as being genuinely good. Shite year continues with it's shiteness.
My favourite comedian! Made me sad to hear the news today.
R.I.P. Sean the comedian legend 🥺🤟
RIP Sean 💕
Legend.
Along with Eric morecambe this is the only time I’ve ever said “ oh no” out loud when I heard of his death  a true comedy genius !!! Rest in peace
Brilliant comedian, so many laughs. RIP Sean
An unfathomable loss. Rest in peace, Sean.
Sean, you will be missed. Thank you for bringing me many hours of enjoyment and distraction. Your humor was truly world-class.
I only got introduced to him two or three years ago thanks to this show, but he quickly grew to become my favourite comedian.  He will be missed.. condolences to his friends and family.
I discovered 8 out of 10 cats and cats does countdown while getting chemotherapy a few years back. Sean’s humour brought me so much laughter during difficult times.  RIP and condolences to his family
What a legend was Sean Lock! Sleep well Sean
Hearing of Seans death, didn't start my day off great. With a World like ours, we need people like Sean to offset the bad and bring us a  lot of joy. He was one of the greats in British comedy. For me he's standing along side the likes of Eric Morecambe and Ronnie Barker. RIP Sean, you will be sorely missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family.
What a wonderful mind.  I was beside myself when I heard the news, truly one of the funniest men in the game, he will be missed.
R.I.P Sean! You were fantastic!
R. I. P Sean lock 🙏 I just found out and can't believe it 😔
A legend, he'll be missed forever, much love to his family and friends.
Sad news R.I.P 😇
I can’t believe it Completely stunned and speechless   Ive had such respect for him and I know he’ll be missed
RIP and thank you. 15 storeys high is a masterpiece
Who cares people die every day .
Endlessly and effortlessly amusing Thank you sir for many hours during which, you made the world a FAR more interesting place.
RIP
Sad day for the cats team will miss mr lock rip sir
Genius comedy mind. RIP 😢
wait he’s dead???
What a loss.
Now, every time I see a Bluebell, I'm gonna think of Sean Lock and tear up.  And a full mouse trap... 😭
This guy made my last 4 years since I´ve discovered 8 out of 10 cats does countdown. Amazing comic, such a lovely sense of humour. Hope you are laughing and making jokes from above.
Heartbroken, thanks for all the laughs. RIP❤️
Most celebrity deaths don't really affect me but Sean will be missed
Hope you are making the people laugh with tears where ever you are! 😢
Rest in peace, Sean, and thank you for all the laughs ❤
Absolute legend and comedy genius whose contribution to British humour is totally undervalued. Many condolences to Sean's family, they must be devastated. I loved Sean's dryness and his sublime ability to ad-lib endlessly. "The Tiger who went for a pint" has me on the floor every time I watch it. Thank you for being you Sean, we'll all miss you tremendously....
May he rest well, a great loss.
Absolutely devastated by the news today - Sean never failed to cheer me up with his wit even after the most strenuous days. I'm not often moved by the passing of a "celebrity" however this one mattered. Panel shows won't be the same again RIP Sean.
🥕🏆
I hope he did his death rattle for effect! I imagine him loving that!
r.i.p. Sean. i may not be a brit but i will always be a fan.
I'm lost for words. Hilariously funny and will be no doubt missed by many. As a seal clubber, they had not seen anyone like him.
Love him ❤️
What a brilliant guy, he made so many people happy. Rest in peace Sean
This man's sense of humor has brought me to tears more than once.He will be missed.
I clicked on this video being a big fan of Sean in the US. I didn’t know he died until reading the comments. I binged his content for the past for years and have caught myself unintentionally cracking similar jokes to him (which none of my friends get because no one else watches him). He definitely shaped my humor in a big way and now my dream of becoming a comedian has only gotten stronger. Rip Sean
I think we all know what the legendary Sean Lock would say to all this well wishing.
Breaks my heart.
nooooooooooooooooooo whhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy nooooooooooooooooooooooo
RIP Sean... a huge loss..
Rest In Peace, Sean. Thanks for all the years of laughs.
Only man that could keep up with Jimmy’s quick wit, truly the comedians comedian best in the business rest in piece my friend😔
Such talent now gone.  RIP Sean.
Sean lock: a word from the dictionary to describe me would have the letters C,U,T in it.  Me: the sentence I would use to describe him would start with a word with the letters C,U,T.  CUT ABOVE THE REST.   Goodnight mate I’ve truly just lost some of my sense of humour.
I can't believe it what a loss he was an absolute legend 💔💔💔💔
A true comedy genius.
My favourite is his remark to Racheal Riley about a challenging wank. RIP Sean
Why did I have to find out like this?! Dammit!
People die, legend's live on, I'm sure in a hundred years from now people will be still talking about Sean lock. RIP Sean.
Never my favourite, but shall be missed all the same. Condolences to his family and friends. Also what the hell is wrong with the, at the time of writing 68 dislikes? Wrong video to give a thumbs down.
Best children’s book written by Sean “The tiger who came for a pint”
I will always remember the "challenging wank" one.
💖
RIP
Sad day for every fan and even more so his family and friends. Doesn’t feel real. He made us happy even though he was battling cancer. Bless the man the myth the legend that is Sean Lock.   Thank you!
I am going to miss in big time, the best sarcastic comedian i know of
RIP Sean, you will be so missed. So funny and one of the best parts of any show. Can't believe it
So Sad to young
Rest In peace to the undisputed champion of carrot in a box.
Wait,  what the heck. This isn't how I wanted to find out about Sean :( .   His ability to keep a straight face will never be forgotten. RIP Sean
Sean was such a unique comedian, no one cracked up everybody around him like he did, one of the greatest ever. And I'm sure he was hell of a dude to be friends with :D  Rest in peace and thank you for all the moments when I felt down but your jokes would light me up like a Christmas tree!
I was just looking up his "Nazi Island" bit when I found out he died. Very sad news. RIP
Sean, float away on the smiles and laughs you have given us
You know it’s a side splitter when Sean Lock laughs at his own joke. Legend.
Thank you Sean. ♥️😥
RIP Sean x
I just can't believe it! RIP Legend
Nazi Island always has me cracking up when Jimmy is trying to stop it. Don't know what it is about comedians passing away but I am genuinely sad he's gone same as rik mayall, Robin Williams when they passed. They put so many smiles upon my face and I'll be eternally greatful.
He had way too many laughs left to give us. Such a loss.
All his countdown gold is on all4 for us to enjoy. RIP SEAN LOCK COMEDY GENIUS.
RIP Sean
1:33 you cut the bit where he kept slipping up as he gave the card to Rachel, it makes it more hilarious, damn I'm gunna miss him.
Greatly talented and will be missed by many. Loved him on this show and how he made everyone truly laugh. RIP Sean thank you for the laughing tears and making  tough days better xx
He deserves more than a 5 minute montage
Dude is soooooooo funny. He's the greatest. RIP, fuck cancer. So sad when I told my wife. She was bummed as well.
I don’t always get emotional when a celebrity dies, but this one is tough. He had me in stitches so often. RIP Sean Locke. The world was better with you in it.
Rip
Oh no such a tragic death how did he die
The tiger who wanted a pint... brilliant. God's speed you legend
Rest In Peace Sean Lock 😔
I am lost with this news...Sean Lock no more!!! sad to the core!!!
I just heard the news. So sad to see him go.  He was an absolute joy to watch.  He will be missed.
Amazing man. Rest in peace.
Was hospitalised a couple of years ago because of mental health issues. Spent most of the time watching Cats Does Countdown clips to cheer me up. Thanks for always making me laugh Sean.
Thank you for many years of making us laugh til we cried,  a true gift, you will be missed RIP
Amazing comedian. His delivery was just superb. I've cried with laughter so many times over the years. It's your time to rest Sean.  We'll miss your humour.   My condolences to Sean's family and friends at this very sad time.  RIP Sean. 🙏
Absolutely gutted when I read that Sean had passed away. I've been watching a lot of clips on YT recently and it's sad to think that he won't be adding to them. Love his sarky humour. Like a silent assassin, one quip and you're gone.
Up there with the greats of comedy! Unbelievably funny! Met Sean a few times when he used my place for filming.  Lovely guy.  Great loss x
Who the heck thumbs down this?!
His up there in my top 5, I'll miss him, RIP
Few comedians have made me laugh like Sean Lock has. A light in the dark has gone out.
There’s only 2 celebrities I’ve ever cried over….Robin Williams….and now Sean Lock…. RIP to one of the greats ❤️
Sadness all the way from Texas. Great loss!
Just under 6 minutes for a Sean lock tribute? Surely you’re doing a longer one soon
Gutted, I can't believe that he's gone 😥
I can’t believe they allowed Trevor Noah to sit at the same table as this legend.
Comedy genius! RIP
Absolute Legend!
Great comedian, lovely human being, condolences to all his family and friends. ❤️
Was fully expecting his Nazi Island TV show idea to be in this compilation. One of my favourite comedians. RIP Sean.
this man could make me laugh and i will take a while to get over this one
Rest in peace you comic-genius.
R.I.P Sean, thanks for making me laugh all these years🙏🏼... "NOOOOOOOOOoo!! WHYYYYyy!! AHHHhhh!!"
Absolutely gutted. Rest in peace Sean.
RIP ❤️
Another great on gone, R.I.P.
Condolences to all. This is sad news indeed.
Thanks for all the laughter - Rest in peace.
Amazingly talented guy, rest in peace.
i just recently found Sean, and i am so sad to hear this. thinking of his family and costars who have lost a great man.
So sad,the funniest comedian of his generation
So sad. Rest in peace Sean.
Can someone release 'the tiger who went for a pint' for cancer related charitys? I for one would purchase such a thing and im gutted that im here commenting on his passing. RiP Sean, bloody well played Sir
I don't find many comedians all that funny. But  8 out of 10 cats has made me cry many times over the years and for me Sean Lock was the star. For someone like myself with a dark and frankly arid sense of humour he really understood the morbid and depraved side of British humour. A true talent lost. RIP Mr Lock.
a  Top Bloke who shall be missed.
Who the hell is downvoting this?! It's a memorial for fucks sake.  Sean was a genius.  I've never tired of watching him on endless repeats of cats does countdown.  Every time it's just as funny.  He will be sadly missed.
Gutted. This show got me through some lonely and unhappy times. Sean will be missed.
The reigning champion of carrot-in-a-box. The world is a poorer place today.
We will miss you, rest easy you hilarious man
Oh I’m so heartbroken 💔 I can’t get over it
😔😔
Hope you making everyone laugh up there mate :’(   Rest in peace
you can hear his voice change over the years such a horrible disease, rest in peace :(
That last clip really hit home for me, you can tell the energy levels just aren't the same. God knows what he was going through and he still made us all crack up.
Rip such a funny guy
A few years ago I met him. A man next to me dropped his change when I was on my break from work so I helped him pick it up. The man said "oh that the last thing I needed" with a kind of sarcastic huff because of dropping his change. I instantly recognised the voice and looked up to see Sean Lock smiling at me as I handed him the coins. I felt so silly after I blurted out that he was mine and my Dad's favourite on 8 of 10 cats does countdown especially when I had to continue standing next to him whilst we both waited for our drinks to be handed to us. But when I finally got my order (relief because I thought I'd come across a complete weirdo) and I walked back to work, he gave me a big friendly smile. I'm now so glad I said it to him, and even though our interaction wasn't much of an interaction he was so nice to me. I'll always remember that.
RIP Sean .Thanks for making me laugh when i wanted to cry xxx
If there is an after life then they're all in for a treat. RIP sean. unbelievably funny man and a tragic loss.
I'm gutted. This man made me laugh every time. RIP.
Tiger Who Came For A Pint was no doubt one of his best.
67 dislikes from the most horrible cunts alive! Sean lock was a comedy genius! I will miss him big time!
Nooooooooooooooo, Whhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, Nooooooooooooooo, Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  RIP Sean. He truly was one of a kind.
He was amazing, im gutted he is gone. Such a wicked sense of fun, I love him so much. I will miss him immensely.
Can’t believe it. He was one of the most gifted comedians. He always made me laugh so much!! Rip Sean❤️
R.I.P Sean
Sean, you’ve been a beacon of light in my life. Your videos and podcasts always managed to put a smile on my face at the toughest of times. Im so sad to see you go. RIP
Sean brought so many laughs .Rest in peace love to all your family and friends x
Rip Sean .  :(
Absolute legend and so sad to hear that he had passed away.  He had me in hysterics many a time for just by being  his naturally funny self. RIP Sean.
So sad, RIP
He made days brighter for so many of us. My deepest condolences to Sean's family and friends.
Honestly, gutted to lose Sean.  Tragic.
What a very funny man he will be sadly missed.
Mr Jangles is on the stairway to heaven xx
Who the fuck gives this a thumbs down?!
Beamrules will never fail to make me laugh, and I just knew it would be in this compilation. Thank you so much for the laughs Sean, you'll be sorely missed.
This show will be completely different now hes gone. Great comedian RIP Sean.
Rest in Peace to a true British icon and a icon to comedy, when I woke up this morning I couldn’t believe the news tbh - the amount of videos ive watched today reminiscing on the iconic moments is crazy. Seam has given me so many laughs especially watching 8 out of 10 cats & 8 out of 10 cats does countdown, those shows wont be the same anymore. Rip legend.
Heartbreaking stuff!
'Coming home to a full mousetrap. Uhhh!' a living legend. Well the 'living' part not true anymore😉 RIP.
RIP Sir
Only he could make Carrot in a Box something really worth watching
You will be missed.
There are very few people on this planet that make me laugh the way Sean did, he seemed just a naturally funny and down to earth guy, condolences to his friends and family. Rest in peace Sean
Bugger it!!  😞
A four letter word to describe him   Real
LEGEND.....Rest Easy
What a legend
Such a shame and such a loss.
So enjoyed Sean Lock's humor... he will be greatly missed many. Thoughts to his family at this time
Love you Sean, you were my favourite comedian. Heartbroken x
R.I.P.
He really was a unique comedian. A great loss - May he rest in piece, and his legacy live on for many years.
He was a true comedian that literally didn't give a shit if it offended anybody as he said it's just comedy if you don't like don't watch and they're very few and far between nowadays RIP
Absolute legend of this country AND comedy.
comic genius, so very funny, dry and very funny. RIP
Rip Sean Lock
There's only been 2 celebrities in 30 years i've been choked up about and genuinely upset when they passed. That's Rik Mayall and Sean Lock. Thank you for the genuine laughs you've given me over the years Sean, I hope there's plenty of whelks up there for you mate.
Such a shame. He was always on point. Should have been Michael McIntyre or someone of that calibre, that wouldn’t be missed, or be a loss to comedy… Will be missed…
RIP
Hands down one of the all time greats and one of my favourite comedians. A real gut punch to have to lose this man and his unique style. R.I.P Mr Lock you will be missed.
Remember his eulogy must be 'aaaaaaaah, aaaaaaaaaaah' You can't write tears
I just had a bad break up a week ago and I've been cheering myself up with endless 8/10 cats videos. Can't believe this has happened - thoughts with his family. Rest in Peace Sean
I came across this by accident.  That sucks.  I liked his sense of humor.
Gutted to hear this when I woke up, R.I.P. will be sorely missed, 8 of out of ten will never be the same again!!! :(
F
I'm gutted this guy was funny as fuck rip Sean you will be missed
Comedy has lost a very funny and great legend...RIP Sean, gone but not forgotten and you will always be remembered as a wonderful and hilarious person.
Sean was the best comedian I knew. So unbothered by others laughter, but when he breaks a laugh himself, it's even better. RIP
May he rest in peace I enjoyed watching him -
Pure class! Funny man, so sad today. He brought joy to the world.
Thank you for the laughs.
o7
Don't know what to say except I'm sure gonna miss this dude.  Love and prayers from Texas.  😥
I had the pleasure of working with him numerous times over the last 15 years. Incredibly funny both on and off stage. He had a Very generous character and very definitely a comedians comedian. A great loss and will be missed.
One of the best things ever was Miles feeding Sean welks.. gutted to read the news today. R.i.p Sean.. you'll be missed.
My favourite want included in that selection, I'll just say "that's a challenging wank".  RIP Sean, loved your work.
This one hurts........
He was so funny I am heartbroken at  the news
Can't believe he's gone R.I.P
Rest easy, sir.
This hit me like a ton of bricks from across the pond. This man gave me so many moments of joy.
RIP Sean Lock ❤️
I dunno whether to like or dislike this video. Love you, Sean!  May Allah have mercy on your soul
The laughs he gave, I'll never forget. Brilliant comedian, he'll surely be missed by all comedy fans
I will always remember Sean as someone who could make me laugh even at my worst times, so naturally funny and made jokes that were so relatable, I will continue to watch clips of him whenever I need a good laugh. RIP you absolute mad lad joker  Gone but never forgotten
sad day. rip sean. "challenging wank" -solid gold!!
I am so unbelievably sad. I've been less sad over the deaths of family members.
My absolute favourite comedian. 100 whelks! RIP
awww  I didn't know Shawn passed. I hope he put his trust in Jesus.
Being 21 I love this guy so much rip been watching since 3 years ago what a legend!
Top bloke, thanks for all the laughs. Maybe someone could publish The Tiger That Went For A Pint in his honour
God bless to a comic genius. He will be sadly missed by so many people.
God I'm going to miss his comedy..... and God is going to be pissing himself laughing. RIP Sean.
R.I.P we can never repay you for all the laughs you have given us.
Completely shocked, loved his comedy, he always made me laugh my head off with his one liners or his new story books, the tiger who went for a pint and the prison guard books were hilarious
Such a sad, sad loss!  Sean has kept me laughing in his stand-ups and on 8 out of ten cats does countdown for years! I’m constantly rewatching and still laughing at his jokes! I particularly loved when he played ‘Carrot in a box’ with Jon Richardson and the blindfold game with Alan Carr.  Condolences to Sean’s family. 😢 💔
Top man rest in peace x
Gutted
Anyone who can make another person laugh will always be missed. Laugh and the world laughs with you. RIP.

Sean you had me crying tears of laughter for years, you've now got me crying again! 😢😭 RIP Sean
Bless..what a funny man. Cancer is cruel
Sean Lock, one of the best comedians in the world, and one of my all time favorites if not THE favorite.   He was too young. This is so unfortunate.  Sean Lock made me smile and laugh so much, especially throughout this shit show of a year, and I'll be eternally grateful for that. Truly. Whenever I felt that my mood was down, I knew I could just pop on 8 out of 10 Cats and watch my favorite Comedian and have a laugh.  Here's a tribute video showcasing his immense talent. If you have some time, please sit down and watch it, watch his work, and smile.  Sean Lock everyone!!
Absolutely fucking gutted!! Rest in peace big man!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Too freakin' soon :(
Rest in Peace Sean. You'll be missed.
This doesn't feel real. Gone too soon. I was waiting for new 8oo10cdc episodes. Love from America. Rip Sean. You brought joy to countless people.
You brung so much joy ❤️💯

Miss him already. Who else is this funny without insulting other people. Gutted
"Or that time when I went seal clubbing..  they said it was like a trolley dash"

It still feels unreal.
Devastating💔 RIP Sean

Can't believe it can ya

He was my absolute favourite in Cats does Coundown,  so many amazing bits, Carrot in a Box, the Countdown coctail and stew, when he disrupts the show with a horn, thank you for the laughs, rest in peace Sean.
Comic genius and a complete one-off! Lucky to have met you Locky

Complete shock. This is horrible news.
I have never been sadder over the death of someone I have never met.
Man he was always the best part of the show, every single time. RIP to one of the greats
He will be missed, the world lost a genius. Thank you Sean for the great laughs
What?! I'm honestly speechless. He's given us so much joy and laughter. This is really really sad. RIP Sean Lock. Thank you for the laughs and for getting an unemployed, penniless youth through some of her tougher days, especially lately. You always had the best mascots. RIP and thank you.
You were my favourite and I will miss you on TV making me laugh so hard 😂
A legend,! RIP
Sean made our family laugh out loud on many occasions. A great comedian. RIP
such a sad day, such a brilliant entertainer, condolences to his family, was a legend of comedy we will miss you Sean
RIP Sean, you always made us laugh, you were one of the best and will always be remembered that way.
My dog  which is my profile picture died this morning,  she wasn't as hilarious as Sean but I will miss them both the same.
My god will he be missed. Watching/listening to him got me through some miserable times. It takes particularly special individuals to make people happy. He was amongst them. Rest in power you absolute legend. 💔
A proper bloke, not many of them about these days on TV.  RIP
5 min video for a legend, poor that.
We need a quote book of all his best ones, it'll be a big book but it'll be worth it. R.I.P
Thank you Sean lock, you made me laugh so loud, it tickled my stomach every time I heard you talk bro. I will miss your humour already. Love you bro 😂❤️😂❤️💯😂 RIP
I am so sad to hear this in the news today. Sean was a brilliant, funny and genuinely likeable guy. A real loss to the world of entertainment. RIP

A tiger and I are raising a pint of 'water' in the pub for you and your family tonight Sean, thanks for all the laughter!
RIP he gave a smile to everyone who watched him ❤
Utterly hilarious and a real gent. He will be sorely missed ❤️
Just woke up to the news, guttered. Living overseas i didn't know of Sean until i watched an episode of 8 out of 10 Cats and immediately I was drawn into his humour and wit and the way he controlled a room full of hilarious people. Underrated in every facet of the word. RIP Sean
I'm devastated, this guy was a comedy genius. Love to his wife and kids  RIP
A genuinely amazing talent, and wonderfully gifted comedian, let alone such a lovely man and personality. Such a devastating loss, and so young with I’m sure many hilarious years in front of him. You brought so much joy to the world Sean, rest in peace mate. Your humour will continue to delight for many, many years.
The man was… will always be  a fucking comedy legend. Cats does countdown will never be the same.
Entertaining people worldwide for years. rest in peace Sean.
Another one who has given the gift of laughter to so many has passed. The world is a little less bright without him. He will be missed.
Love love loved Sean Lock. I hope he´s resting peacefully and pissing off everyone he´s now with :)
"I knew id won when 3 of the judges threw up behind me"  such sad sad news today
He was one of my absolute favorites of the whole bunch. This really sucks.
I'll open a can of water to Sean tonight.  Playing gig's in heaven now. Rest easy.
I can't believe he's died, one of the best comedians. Rest easy Sean 💔
I only felt sad when it ended
This should of been a lot longer than 5:53. So many funny moments and will be greatly missed. Well done on winning rectum of the year!
Genuinely shocked and saddened for his family, friends and the many of us he entertained.  Too clever,  too funny, taken too soon. RIP
His sense of humour was a ray of sunshine.
Thank you Sean…on of the very best. You can’t write tears…..RIP.
Funny guy!!
Rip to a national treasure ❤️
Legend, we will miss you Sean x
So sad,  can’t believe it 🥲
"I won't spit on you when we're having sex tonight"  Rest in peace Sean
WHAT??????? Im in shock. R.I.P Sean Lock. My deepest sympathies to your loved ones on their loss. Thank you for all the laughs 😢
i cant fucking believe it... it makes me sick seeing the last picture in this video. god, you'll be missed...
Thank you for all the laughs and tears of joy, Sean. Your humour and wit were some of my few refuges in my darkest times. Rest in peace. I am sure that the work you leave behind will keep healing many more souls like mine for many years to come. THAT is some legacy, dear sir.
Hilarious man.  Not many comedians are witty of the cuff.  He was. RIP.
This one really hurts.
Can’t forget Nazi island…one of the best comics out there
It's been quite the journey, especially when I've just finished my binge watch of his shows a few days ago. I'm endlessly grateful for getting me through tough times. A new audience is awaiting. RIP.
The funniest comic to have ever lived. Easily.
rest in peace. ty for laughs sean.
RIP Sean Lock. You had me in tears of laughter over many tears, you were a proper comic.
No comedian has ever made me laugh like he has, was a real shock seeing the news today.
I can't believe he is gone, just keep thinking about all his hilarious moments.
Wholesome content.
My favourite modern day comedian by a long shot.. God bless your family at this sad time♥️
The best to ever do it. 🙌🕊
Rest in peace Sean.
From Cape Town, South Africa....you sure were one funny man, and I enjoyed watching you on 8 out of 10...RIP Sean!
How have 58 people disliked this what is wrong with them ?!?!
very funny man.sad news
I can't see them carrying on with Cats does countdown. It will not be the same, I just can't believe he's passed away. Rest In Peace Sean Lock. You are arguably one of the greatest comedians of all time. King of the carrot in the box. Taken too soon
Someone PLEASE tell me this is a fucking joke. I had this vid recommended and thought nothing of it except for the usual YouTube algorithm reminder of stuff I used to watch. I’m laughing as usual when it’s anything Sean lock till I read the comments….the life from my face drained and my smile dropped instantly no fucking way what the fuck….
A legend of a bloke, and a true genius of comedy.  He'll be sorely missed.
RIP Sean Lock. Thank you for the laughs. Your dark humor was a light in these crappy times
RIP to a legend
Rest in piece you absolute legend, you have made me laugh so much over the years such sad news to hear 😢😢
Why would anybody press thumbs down ffs
I will miss Sean Lock, didn't agree with everything he has said but he was an astounding comedian and is a loss for the craft.
Gutted to hear this today, I went through a really bad relationship split this time last year and watching Sean got me through some of the most difficult lonely times I've ever had, Chuckling away in an empty house, God bless you mate!! Thanks for all the laughs!! P.s I still read the tiger that went for a pint before bed time!!
News is hard to believe. A genius at work on cats. Rip Sean
Will he be having an open funeral? or anything of the sort where people can pay respects?    A great lose, THE funniest comedian on 8OO10CDC; right up my street kindof humour, RIP Sean
I actually can't believe this legend has passed away 😢 Gutted is an understatement, what a comedian. Rest easy Sean 🙏
Such a tragic loss, amazing and hilarious Sean
He must have been pissed off sat next to that wanker Trevor Noah
I'm simply gutted.
R.I.P nuff said
A brilliant mind, what a great loss. He will be terribly missed. ‘You can’t write tears, Jimmy’..  RIP Sean Lock 🙏
RIP big man
I always watch the show on YouTube from Belgium. We can’t watch it live, today I was choked by the tribute te Sean lock part and quickly found out that Sean has pasted away today. He was to me one of the reasons why this show is so funny. Sean you wil be missed and I will watch al the reruns remembering you. Thanks and Rest In Peace.
The funniest on 8OOTCDC.  Very sad to hear he’s has passed.  😢 RIP Sean
Rest in peace.
In accordance with Sean's wishes, I've prepared a short obituary:  *"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHYYYYYYYYY? NOOOOOOOOOO! AHHHHHHHH!!!!"*   Shocked. Such a sudden loss and far too soon. He was the most wickedly unique comedian out there - truly a one of a kind comedic mind. Now he's up there in Heaven, having a redo for Rectum of the Year with Maradona. Hope he gets to win this time.  RIP Sean, thanks for all the laughs ❤️
Still can't believe it's true. Will be missed!
Tried to think of something witty to say  but I'm just left feeling sad. 🙄
Damn, damn, damn.
Thanks  a million for the laughs. REST IN PEACE SEAN.X
It might sound silly but Sean’s work has helped me laugh when I needed it most. Rest in peace mate
"I'm more like a sensation, an idea" 😂😂
I just laid down in bed and got on YouTube and the "Sean Lock's last video" popped up. So sad. A comedian who could make me laugh out loud. R.I.P.
Rest In Peace you wonderful, wonderful man.
Rest in peace you magnificent bastard, the good times and laughs this man brought me is just immense, thank you so much and have fun with a good seal clubbing
RIP Sean
So very sorry to hear of Sean's passing.   Such a hilarious man.
I remember watching these when Sean didn't look or sound well...never thot we'd be remembering him...sad day very funny man ! RIP Sean
Have watched lots of clips today, he really was a cut above with his comedic talent. RIP Sean.
Can't believe he's gone.  RIP Sean.
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo, wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhy
Oh no way :(
RIP Sean
Wouldn't it be great to hear his comebacks on the comments to his own tributes?   Rest in Peace you beautifully twisted turnip. L.U.V.  T x
This fucker made me laugh so much. Kindest thoughts to his family and friends.
Nooooo whyyyyy nooooo ahhhhhhh
I my really upset in Sean’s passing what an amazing man rest in peace Sean x
RIP Sean. You will be missed.
So was he the riddler? 😜
The rectum of the year bit had me in tears. Funny to the end.
I can’t beleive it
The tears of laughter that Sean has sent down my face over the years far outweigh my tears of sadness I have shed for his passing . Thank you Sean and RIP give them hell in heaven 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When you can make Jimmy Car cry laughing, you're something special. Rest In Peace Sean 💛
Superb! Thanks, Sean 👍
I'm French and Sean is the one that made me discover British humor at its best.   You'll be missed, even by a frog eater like me. Hope you'll find the best seal clubbing spot in Heaven. RIP
Thank you for the laughs, RIP
Unbelievablely funny what a talent you will be hugely missed rest easy ❤
R.i.p Sean
Fucking rip, god damn, I did not expect this today.
Can't get over his desire to be "fly-tipped" on his death... That is so funny/sad a real good guy
He will be truly missed. A class act, so funny and such a nice guy. X
Absolutely gutted to hear the news today.  He was, any will always be, one of my favourite comedians.  We've lost a good one today. Thoughts are with his family and friends.
Rip a great comic 😢😢😢
He made me laugh so hard, from a small town in Northern Michigan  thank you sir  he will be missed all over the world
Can we just pretend this video stops at 5:44. So sad! RIP Sean, and thank you for years of jaw aching laughs.
Undefeated carrot champion rest in paradise sean
He will be greatly missed. What a comedic genius 👏
I come to Sean and a handful of other comedians to pick me up if I’m ever down - he has never failed me. So this news has an extra edge of sadness. RIP Sean and thank you for the laughs 😊
Will miss you Sean, thanks for all the great laughs through the years.
Top Top comedian ❤️🙏❤️
I couldn't even begin to count how many times this mad bastard has made me laugh, RIP Sean.
It's a sad day but on the bright side Rectum of the Year 2022 is anyones game now!
The greatest Comedian of my time will never forget the laughs he has given me. Rest in Peace Sir.
I will always remember Sean lock he made my lockdown so easy
Sean Made 8 out of 10 Cats Mostly , RIP !
Rest in Peace Sean
LOVE IT RIP SUCH LEGNED💜🤎
RIP - loved his humor.... he will be missed.
He will be missed! RIP Sean
Absolute legend.  His wit will be missed.
A gifted comedian. He will never be forgotten in this house. May he rest in peace.
what a legend, RIP Sean
The nation has lost someone very special. Endless laughs from a comic genius. You will be missed :(
Loved Sean’s dry sense of humour absolute brilliant. RIP you will be missed
I went from laughing my ass off to crying when I saw the last picture. Rest in peace Sean, you went too soon. A massive hole in the comedy world now.
I just discovered this man a few weeks ago..
Hearing the news today, saddened me as Sean was one of the greatest modern comics. He had given me so many laughs over the years and the loss of his humour, will be a blow to modern comedy  RIP Sean Lock and thank you for the pleasure you gave us.
Genuinely gutted today. He was naturally funny and one of very few comics who could make me cry with laughter. RIP Sean 😪
He could always make me laugh like no other on this show. RIP Sean.
Legend
😢
WHAT?! He's dead?
He really did make me cry with laughter. RIP x
RIP Locko
RIP. SO funny will be missed
You were a sensation, RIP😔
Just heard about his passing, such a legend, he will be missed greatly.
Legends never die, R.I.P Sean!
When did Sean die?
RIP Sean Lock
"I think we're dead, Jimmy"  "I've shown it twice. Once to my wife, and one time I slowed down for a horse" were my favourites. Rest easy Sean. 💞
Comedy Genius RIP 💙
I still can't believe he's gone. Such a tragic loss, he always cheered me up and made millions of people laugh. RIP Sean Lock, a master of comedy.
A great man, funny. Heard the news and was devastated
It always seemed to me like Sean Lock was the bar to which other comedians judged themselves and their material. If you could make Sean Lock properly laugh you know youre on to something good. Such a loss.
" I wanted to be a fanny magnet"
Genuinely funny guy who didn't seem to need to tweet about everything. Will be much missed.
Watching this I forgot for a couple of minutes that Sean left us today however, when it got to 5:46 and... just seeing the letters RIP before his name, man... today has been a sad day. The world was cheated at least 20 years of comedy genius. I will truly miss him.
Can we have a video with every bit of footage you have please
I feel like I knew Sean in real life somehow. Such a sad day. RIP Sean
Noooooooooo! Whhhhyyyyyyy? Noooooooooo! Aaaaggggghhhhh!
Thank you for bringing laughter into are lives....   Such a Sad Loss
What a legend will be missed x
so many evenings passed with sean lock making me laugh. RIP sean.
Such a sad loss to comedy, thoughts and condolences to his family and friends  r.i.p Mr lock
RIP </3
RIP Sean Lock, you are missed
Goddamn its weird being gutted by the news of his death and then spending the rest of the day crying with laughter browsing his life's work
So sad to hear of Sean's passing. An incredibly funny and witty man. I had just watched old 8 out of 10 Cats complications the other week and was reminded of his brilliance. Forever the Carrot in the Box champion! He will be greatly missed. Rest easy, Sean.
Made me laugh when I needed it most, thank you for everything & more. Sean lock, we thank you.
Who's unlinked this? Sean is one of the greatest of all time. He was absolutely hilarious.
💔
This man was an absolute genius. Nobody did comedy like him. Always saying exactly what was on his mind and never mixing his words to cater to anyone. We will all miss you Sean 💔
I'm 19 and love comedy it's my stress relief. Thank you Sean for making me laugh all these years whether it be a boring night or exam time. You'll be missed mate 🖤
What an absolute bloody shame :( Taken way too soon.
So sad
Thank you for this. So much laughter on such a sad day.
A good man, you pass in peace mate

This hit hard today. Will miss you Sean Lock. Positive vibes and hugs to his family!!
Fuck me man... :'(
Gutted loved Sean rip man
Thank you for all the laughs over the years Sean. Rest in peace <3
Legend.....
I can't believe this! I'm so sad for his family and friends.. Such a brilliant man... RIP sir..
Words can't even describe how much joy Sean has brought me. And how much pain I feel from his death.
A real shock to hear this sad news today . RIP Sean ,you will be sorely missed .
Makes me lol every time- and cry laughing- different tears tonight - a genuine legend I comedy - many will say that’s out- but his humour was individual
Gutted. A genuinely sad day
He and the rest of 8 out of 10 cats helped me through some tough times. He'll be missed!
Thank you Sean, for all the years of laughs. You have been a pleasure to watch and a pleasure to quote. Truly one of British Comedy’s greatest talents. I can never look at a carrot the same way.
R.i.p what a funny man 🤣👍
🙏🙏🙏
Absolutely devastated. RIP Sean. Thank you so much for the laughs
So tragic, I’m going to miss Sean so much
I hope Sean gets his wish and is fly tipped in a area of outstanding natural beauty.  Ill miss you Sean
The time Rachel put her viking ski mask on and he said that's a challenging w@nk I was in tears, what a fantastic bloke, he's going to be sorely missed. RIP Sean god bless.
One of Britain's ALL TIME greats of Comedy - Thanks for bringing so many smiles to people's lives. RIP Sean. Thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.
I'm still in shock by this sad news...😥👏
Rectum of the year was just gold!  An the RNLI gag gets me!  Comedians comedian!
RIP you legend, you will be missed x
An absolute pleasure to have been able to watch this man through the years. A true comedy genius and naturally funny. You will be sadly missed Sean and the world will be a dull place without you. RIP Sir.❤
We've lost one of the wittiest and funniest people out there, and comedy as a whole is less for it. Thank you for all the laughs.
This is so sad.... rest in peace Sean. You were always one of my favorite British comedians.
What a loss. Very sad.
One of the few comedians who could double me over with laughter when watching them on TV. Such a sad, sad loss. All reports indicate he didn't let cancer bring him down and he lived his best life possible to the end, which is wonderful to know. God speed you funny bastard.
I'm more sad about this guy passing away, than I was when my own grandad did. Honestly such a lovely and comical man it's truly sad to hear he's gone.
RIP to one of the greatest british comedians of all time </3
Absolute legend!!!!!
What an extraordinarily intelligent sense of humour, truly one of a kind. Light soils Sean, as we say around here.
Thanks for all the laughs Sean. RIP. XXX
A huge loss to British comedy. I was stunned by the news today. 8 Out Of 10 Cats will never be the same again. RIP Sean.
Funniest man on countdown
Didn’t even know who he was until now. Pretty funny.
RIP Sean.
Such a sad day for almost everybody. I was at work today and have the nurses I worked with, doctors too - were talking about how funny this man is. I’m genuinely gutted - not just as a fan - but as a human being. My thoughts genuinely go to his poor family. Remember - he was a hilariously funny and decent man💜
Disgrace if England don't wear ugg boots and a cape in Qatar.
Absolute legend! I'm off to binge watch all his stand up shows and cry 😢
RIP Sean. Condolences to your Family, Friends, & all who knew you.
It was physically impossible for me to be sad when watching this show with Sean on it. Even in my darker days, I'd put it on and within a few minutes, I would be crying with laughter. A huge loss. RIP Sean.
Rest in peace the greatest
This guy would have me falling off my sofa laughing. Love him. Thank you for uplifting me all those times. Rest in peace Sean.
RIP truly a fucking amazing comedian
Rip man its not fair such a great comedian improved so many of my bad days Thankyou shaun
"I knew I'd won then I heard three of the judges throwing up behind... That's why I knew I had it in the bag..."
I'm sorry to see him go.
This guy would have me falling off my sofa laughing. Love him. Thank you for uplifting me all those times. Rest in peace Sean.
I literally just found out sean passed away……
Swede here. Sean was my all-time favourite comedian, he's made my chest hurt out of laughter more than any Swedish comedian has even come close to doing. I hope he knew just how many fans he had worldwide. Rest in Peace
Why is it all the best ones go early but the dull lefties go on forever? There is no justice.
RIP king
Cannot believe this... Being Canadian, we do not have access to  8 out of 10 cats but, stumbled upon some clips on here a few months ago and Sean always cracked me up. He will surely be missed.
8 out 10 cats just won't be the same show. I'd be surprised if it continues. End of an era. So 😥.
If you haven’t already,watch 15 storeys high. It’s where I first saw him. Amazing. It’s also on YouTube for free.
Gutted my favourite comedian  RIP 🙏
Such an amazing comedian. R.I.P.
RIP Sean was an amazing comedian.
I don't normally miss celebrities when they die but this death really sucks. He was so brilliant. RIP
His loss is felt here in the states as well.  He was one of the main reasons I would search out bits from 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, QI, Would I Lie To You and the regular 8 Out of 10 Cats.  When I saw Sean's face, I knew I was going to get my fill of laughter and then some.  He was so funny and quick witted.  When I saw the bit of "Carrot In A Box", immediately afterward, I said to myself, "This is a guy I want to see more of and I know I'll never get tired of him."  And I never did, nor I ever will.  He is greatly missed, and I hope he is cremated and poured out into Piers Morgan's eyes, as he requested in an episode of Countdown.  Thank you Sean for so much.  We really didn't deserve as much as you gave us, but we're all so much happier in our lives that you did.
Just gutted. One of the last true great comedians.
We’ve probably lost the funniest person in the world. Bugger.
I often quote his jokes in my own real life, I'll miss him so much. Comedy Genius - more than that.
The greatest player of "carrot in a box" the game has ever seen. RIP Sean 🥺
Legend
I'm laughing... I'm crying.... It's so unfair 😭😭😭....
RIP to a legend
Sad day! RIP Sean.
An absolute comedy legend. Thank you for the laughs Sean x RIP
Rest In Peace Sean😢 Truly a brilliant comedian..
Sean, thank you.
I have been watching loads of these videos online and I thought this was some title linked to a joke he made. I never thought it was real :(
The world feels a little less bright day. Condolences to his family and his comedy family.
The world has lost it's funniest man today, RIP Sean.
RIP Sean Lock.   Very very sad news today.  Many thanks thou because you will be cracking me up for years to come.  Thoughts are with friends and family now.  I know it is a sad time but I know you must have been very proud to know him and spend time with him.
Legend
A genuinely funny man, who'll be greatly missed - Reminds me of the old days, when greats like Sid James and Benny Hill were just suddenly gone one day...There must still be a few people who don't feel the need to broadcast their every move on social media...
RIP funny man
Such a sad day, it was obvious that he was ill though, his voice completely changed, and he was looking weak at times. I was really hoping that he would beat the cancer. RIP Sean Lock, now you can compete with Maradonna once again, I was crying laughing when he told this joke.
♥️♥️♥️
“I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex.” Wish I’d met Sean )not for the reason above).  Jeez. All the troubles in the world and now this. Sympathies to his family and friends.
Sean Lock "I won't spit on your when we're having sex tonight"  Was one of the happiest times in lcckdown, can't believe channel 4 missed it out.  R.I.P.
Gone way too soon. What a talented and hilarious guy. RIP
I think making people laugh is one of the best acts a human can do, thank you Sean we will miss until we laugh again rest in peace x
Comedy hero ❤️
Somewhere there's a wonky pigeon putting people off their sandwiches at a train station, and that wonky pigeon is the reincarnation of Sean Lock. Rest easy Sean. The cheekiest bastard in Britain.
clearly a genius,nutter send our love to rik mayall and bill hicks xxxxxxxxxxxxrest in laughter xxxxx
Rip ! 😞
RIP one of the best comics ever
rest in peace u icon
Saw him live in Ireland 3 years ago and he was as funny in person as he is here, everytime he got jimmy carr to laugh in this video it just made me sad.
Seans “a challenging wank” will go down in the history of countdown.   Rest easy Sean 😢
Sad sad sad god bless you sir happy meeting with the Lord 🙏 he's going to laugh the heavens you were so awesome sean night night but happy waking in the light 💗 God bless you sir you made me cry 😭 😂 love you mate ❤️
RIP Sean you were one mad funny guy and you’ll be missed for all the insane things that you’d come out with
WAIT WHAT SEAN DIED?! HOW! NO. Holy shit I thought this was just a normal video. I'm destroyed, Sean is (was) one of the funniest people alive I can't believe it
Guess that's so much like Sean to learn about his death in the YouTube Interweb comments
😢😢
He was a national treasure. What a loss.
Shocked to see this. One of my favourite comedians!
So sad to hear this. Loved his surreal comedy and the laughter he brought
When Miles was feeding him the cockles I have genuinely never laughed so hard at a tv show. A  deeply unappreciated comedy icon, RIP Mr Lock, cheers for the laughs.
Absolutely shook finding out Sean has died, what an absolute genius of a comic, one of a kind, Abosulte great on every panel show, damn UK comedy has lost a great one
Cannot even described how shocked and saddened to hear the news. RIP you wonderfully dangerous man. Thank you for the laughs
What a pleasure it was to have have watched you over the years Sean, thank you for all the laughs!! Rest in peace to a wonderfully unique and original comic  <3
i'm sure you  have them rolling around already upstairs !! RIP Sean and thanks for all the laughs
Not gonna lie, this one really hurts. One of my comedy heroes. RIP Sean. You'll be missed greatly.
Undefeated carrot in a box champion  Rest in peace
Legend.
Such a big loss. what an incredible guy he was. Will be missed. Thank you for all the laughs over the years.
What a great man. A true legend. RIP :(
I’m gonna miss this man, glad I got the chance to see him live
Ah Sean you wonderful beauty. You’ll always be my “rear of the year”. God bless you and Rest In Peace.
Tough wank
Lov your work sir. Thanks. RIP.
I've only known Sean Lock from watching these highlights. Absolutely funny, his presence really makes the difference. It certainly sucks to lose such a genius, I wish his family the best. R.I.P ... with love from California.
will always think of him whenever i smell hot tarmac. rest in peace having bought so much laughter and joy to so many people. really hard to accept something so tragic happening to someone who has only ever made me happy.
Knowing Sean he'll take a carrot with him, but you won't know that. RIP to this wonderfully funny man.
RIP Legend! :(
I can only assume 54 people disliked this video as they’re sad Sean has died. Otherwise they’re heartless bastards....
Deeply saddened at the news of Sean’s passing earlier today. He’s an absolute legend. I’ll never forget the love letter that he retrieved from his loft , written to his girlfriend working at the abattoir. Deepest sympathies to his family. Much love from Johannesburg, South Africa 🇿🇦.
A legend gone too soon.. RIP Sean
Ahh fuck....I didnt expect this to hit so hard.....
Ahh fuck....I didnt expect this to hit so hard.....
OMG did he die. Rest in peace. What an amazingly talented guy.
Man, cant believe this. Still thought to myself, now that I love in Europe, once the pandemic is over - I'd love to go see Sean Lock live if he ever does a show again. And then this.
RIP, what a FUCKING LEGEND
When celebrities die we usually tend  to go back and watch songs/movies/compilations to remember and pay our tributes   Sean is one of those people that you read the news in between already watching them out of pure brilliance   Its a fucking net loss for comedy, and unfortunatly a huge blow for panel shows since he is almost always the highlight of the episode in many ways   Enjoy your whelks in heaven Sean! Hopefully they throw you back after you've told everyone in charge to f**k off
💖
Sean brought a lot of joy and laughter to so many people.  Even in my lowest moments, I could watch Cats does Countdown and instantly feel better listening to him and watching his antics. He was a brilliant comedic mind who will be greatly missed.
Absolutely gutted to hear Sean has left us.....! My all time favourite comedian.... fabulously funny with genius delivered gags. Fly high Sean...RIP and thank you  ❤️
One of the greatest comedy geniuses of our time... Rest in peace, you hilarious bastard! :'-(
RIP. You were my favorite comedian on the panel.
So sad. This has gutted me more than I expected. What a great comic.
The fact anyone hit the dislike button on this video genuinely astounds me. A truly unique comic who will be greatly missed
Absolutely stunned to hear this news as we all are, another of the greats taken all too soon.  My condolences to his family, terribly sad.
How on earth does he think so quickly for a joke? Comedy genius
He made me laugh so hard so many times, much love, RIP Sean
Intelligent comedy that avoids nastiness, and remains warm, sharp and witty is so rare. The measure of him must be that in an age where all seem to broadcast every open wound in their life - he kept his own mortality and horrific illness to himself. He will go down as one of the titans of his craft. Such a shame.
Funny man!! Shame it wasn't Michael Mc in a tyre!!!
He upstaged every single comedian in that show. That’s how good he was! Rip Mr Lock. You were 8 out of 10 cats does countdown.
This hit me like a truck
R.I.P what a talented comedian. Such a massive loss to comedy
This coming up in my recommendations is how I found out he passed away. Cool cool. Damn he was a great comedian. 8 out of 10 cats wont be the same
Thanks to whoever compiled this. I felt sad when I read about his passing, but watching this had me in stitches. I haven't laughed so much in ages!!
Laughed so hard at Sean's comedy...8 out of 10 cats countdown was my fave show in school.... RIP
Laughing with tears in my eyes watching this. Now THAT IS  a challenging wank.
Gutted such a young man and so funny taken to early
sharp with perspective
Extremely funny and inventive,  tons of laughs thanks to him. He will missed.
Excellent humour. Watched so much of his material. Sad to hear that this is it.
Such a great man Sean Lock. May he have a peaceful rest.
DAMN! This is truly a staggering loss. This man's curmudgeonly sarcasm thrills me so...
RIP 🙏🏼
Once a generation we have someone who is just bloody funny
Absolute genius of British comedy rest in peace sean 🙏
" You can't write tears, Jimmy" . Words of a legend.
OMG! I had no idea Sean had died. He will be truly missed.
I briefly saw Jon Richardson’s tweet this morning and genuinely thought it wasn’t real or was someone else he knew called Sean. I still can’t believe it, what a talent and presence gone far too soon. Whenever he spoke, you listened because you knew it would be comedy gold - whenever he laughed, you celebrated because you knew you were on the right track to being funny, obviously just not as funny as him. 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown won’t be the same again and I hope Channel 4 has months and months of tributes to come. What with Paul Ritter gone and now Sean Lock, two absolute heroes of Channel 4 have passed and it’s devastating. RIP Sean “Rectum of the Year” Lock
We'll miss you, Sean. :(
Sean Lock brought me laughter and escape during my A-levels. He was a true comic and a wonderful person.
Can't believe it RIP Sean 😢made countdown hilarious, the time with Miles was so funny. Will be sorely missed
I can't think of anyone that could take his place, Sean was a comedy genius and will be sadly missed.  Gone too soon
Sean has made me laugh on so many dark days, thoughts and prayers are with his family
Such a shame, brilliant comedian a real loss. RIP Sean Lock.
What the..... I didnt know he passed away... :(
Sean Lock, a god amongst men. Now sits amongst the gods.
Finniest and unique man , gonna miss you sean !
What?! No fucking way. Damn Sean, the world will miss you and your weird twisted sense of humor
Thanks for making me hurt myself laughing so many times. Bless you.
We shall never see his likes again! Peace over his memory
Absolute legend. These clips will never get old and will forever bring a smile to my face. Thank you Sean and rest easy.
R.I.P Sean. Thx for all the great laughs you have given us !
Such a gloriously disturbing, irreplaceable man. R.I.P sir, and thanks for being you.
A unique and genius style of comedy. Complete one of a kind legend.

Sean got me laughing so much over the years. You will be sorely missed.
Best British comedian, easy. What a sad loss.
My all time favorite and funniest ever comedian. RiP Sean Lock you'll bring the house down in heaven 🙏
:(
Rest In Peace Sean, a great loss to the comedic world
R.I.P LEGEND ❤❤❤
Legend
Thanks for all the laughs Sean! Comedy Genius RIP
This is why you get the hpv vaccination.
Thanks for the laughs Sean. You showed me how to be a lovable curmudgeon….Well, that’s enough emotion for the day. Pop on
A super funny one off guy that also thought brexiteer's were idiots. And how right he was so sad he had to die at such a pathetic time in history .
<3
Bloody Hell. I saw a video labeled Sean's last video. Did not know it was serious. Favorite Sean moment is the original Carrot in a Box
"Remember that time Sean mimed hitler climbing up a coconut tree" absolute genius. r.i.p
Fucking gutted...
this is how I'm finding out he's passed and I can't believe it. not Sean :(
How could you possible click the dislike button on this video? It’s a bloody tribute to a man that’s just died of cancer. I don’t understand it..
This man made some of my dark days into bright days. What a shame this is.
In accordance with Sean's wishes:  nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.
Proper gutted , he brought us so many funny jokes and funny times on countdown not sure it would be the same without him. R.I.P
I really appreciate you guys putting this video up. Sean could make me laugh so hard that I thought I was going to black out. As rough as the past few years have been, I'm grateful he was there to give us a little happiness now and then. Cheers, Sean.
True legend that will be sorely missed
He was absolutely brilliant.  Rest peacefully. 💙
RIP Sean your humour, wit and style Will be  sadly missed.
Teary watching this, great man
I'm so sad. I'm American and I honestly never heard of this show until the pandemic. I was completely alone during the lock down and I with spending a lot more time online when I discovered this show. And it really got me through that time with so much laughter. I think I've watched everything related to this show that is possibly on YouTube because I instantly loved it. I really love Sean Lock . RIP , Sean.

I honestly did not expect this news to hit me as hard as it did. Luckily I'll always have your tapeworm advice with me. Rest in peace, Sean. You were truly one of a kind.
Heartbroken & shocked over the news. So sad
My favourite comedian, personally nobody else will come close, such a unique British comedy style. One of the greats!
You fought a good fight now you sleep RIP my namesake
One of the best comedians I’ve ever seen, shame I’m not gonna be able to see him live one day. He made 8 out of 10 cats does countdown so funny and brilliant never gonna be the same without him RIP to the genius comedian Sean lock. Love and support for friends and family of Sean. X
4 words. carrot in a box.
Possible the worst news to get. Like bam, didn't know wth was going on. Thank you Sean!
I prefer to remember him as a true British sex symbol/shagging ledge.
Fucking hell I’ll really, really miss this man. RIP Sean you absolute legend
I thought he was getting better. This breaks my heart i just loved his humor. He is one of my all time favorites.
Nooooooooo 😞
Crying watching Sean & not for the normal reason.

Thank you Sean. You will be missed.
This is so sad. He was always great to listen to. Always in tears of laughter.
Rip an amazing comedian
One of a kind, i don't watch many comedians, but he's something else. Genuinely gutted
Absolutely gutted for his family rip sean you legend
"That's a challenging wank" Best line ever. Sleep well Sean, we'll miss you...
I haven't had television in years now so I didn't know he was sick. RIP.
I saw the title of this video and gasped.  I hoped it was some sort of sick joke (which wouldn’t surprise me) because I didn’t even know he was sick.  He was a bedrock of two of my favorite shows, and will be missed.
Massive comedian... brilliant sense of humour.. heart goes out to his family and his nearest and dearest. Watched these episodes hundreds of times.. RIP Sean ...
Thankyou Sean Lock for all the laughs over the years
I'm genuinely gutted about his passing
I'll raise a glass of canal water for this legend tonight!
Genuinely saddened by Sean’s passing . He was such a funny character , didn’t need to be rude just had a way of making everyone laugh. RIP Sean , comedy has lost a true great .
Of the few times Iv been brought to tears with laughter he was responsible for most of them. RIP Sean and prayers to your family. What an unbelievable loss.
Taken too early, thank you for all the laughs.
Devastated by the news. I was hoping for many years of laughs with Sean to come. Thank you Sean, you were the best!
Is it my imagination or is there a lot snuffing it from this show?
A legend RIP Sean, you will be forever missed
As you said, “You can’t write tears.” You really can’t, rest easy Sean, thanks for the laughs, I hope you got home to a full mousetrap as you always wanted. Heartbroken 💔
:'(
British legend 👌 always love the clip compilations whenever I need a laugh
Absolute legend, Sean, you were one of the funniest guy's I sadly never met.  Loved all your work but 15 Stories High is one of the best sitcoms ever.  R.I.P big man, you certainly deserve it.
So funny,he will be missed RIP
Absolutely heartbreaking💔
Everyone has their own fond memories and their best Sean moments. For me it's the carrot in a box they did... utter genius 😂 R.I.P Sean
I'll never forget him saying "That's a challenging wank" I had to spit my tea out the first time I saw that 🤣🤣 RIP Sean, you will definitely be missed ❤
I grew up French and struggled to learn English and I have to say that Sean Lock's comedy was the best gift this language brought me. Rest in Peace Legend ❤
Sean was a great comedic talent.  I was shocked to learn of his death today.  He was hilarious.  Gutted 😞
right now, he's up there, or lets be real....down there.....pitching Nazi Island.
RIP Sean. You we're a comic genius
Goodbye Mr. Lock. Thanks for everything. You’ll be missed.
From tears of laughter to whatever, thanks Sean
So very sad to learn of Sean’s passing. He was such a talented comedian. R.I.P. Sean.
6 minutes was not nearly enough for him.
I keep looking at the calendar wishing it would say April 1. Going to miss Sean so much.
Absolute comedy genius. He may be gone but will continue to put smiles on people's faces for many years to come. RIP 🙏
Sean lock is and will be forever a icon ❤️
man this dude was a legend he was so funny he reminded me of like a dads friend or funny uncle his laugh was so contagious
Weird how some deaths hurts more than others.  Sean was always my favorite on 8 out of 10 cats.
Comedy legend, a sad loss for everyone, no more so than his family and friends ❤
Only other time felt loss like this was when Rik Mayall passed. RIP Genius. So much laughter.
A fan from Malaysia. Sean Lock = Laughter. RIP.
So fucking sad and heartbreaking ❤️
"That's a challenging wank."   RIP mate.
I think this hits hard because he wasn't a huge name all over the newspapers and Twitter etc. He was just a really, really funny guy who helped make channel 4 comedy panel shows such a success. He wasn't a massive "celebrity" and didn't need to be. He made people laugh effortlessly. Just seemed like a top bloke. Thank you, Sean Lock (and a great name too).
Coming home to a full mouse trap 😂
Never used to watch 8 out of 10 cats does countdown…but the genius of Sean one evening got me hooked. The amount of times I’ve burst out laughing since then, watching him on YouTube at night (disturbing my wife’s sleep in the process) is testament to his comedic gift. RIP Sean. Condolences to your family.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What a real shock. You will always be fondly remembered, RIP Sean... You have brought us all endless laughter and I will be forever grateful for that
Rest in piece Sean
Rest In Paradise Sean Lock, you've brought me endless laughs over the years. Wherever you are, I hope you're well.
Great great man, will be sorely missed by so many people. My thoughts are with his family & friends at this tough time. Thank you for the endless laughs
Another genius gone too soon. R.I.P
RIP a legend amongst all.
This news hit hard, thanks for the proper belly laughs over the years
Fucking legend ❤️ wishes to the family. Cancers a bitch took my dad as well the universe always takes the best people first :(
Rest In Peace Mr lock, the  undefeated carrot in the box champion. His comedy and persona always made me feel better , he will be missed.
I’m genuinely so upset about his passing, always knew it was gonna be a good show if he was on it. RIP Sean Lock
Watched him all the way from Sri lanka....loved every bit of his humor
The Rectum of the Year Awards will never be the same without him.
"Rear of the year with the gloves off"  "I beat Fern Cotton"  - Sean Lock
I’ll never forget the episode he offered to “not spit on Miles Jupp when they have sex tonight” where he had Jimmy and myself In tears. Thoughts are with his family
Absolutely gutted. He was my favourite comedian. Such a genius with wit
Gutted, R.I.P sean ❤️
"That's a challenging wank" - Sean Lock, comedy genius. RIP
Oh! I didn't know. When did ha pass? That is very sad. I really enjoyed his humour.
Gutted at the news ... so many laughs given, so many laughs now lost ...
He will be dearly missed!
Requiescat in pace, Sean ...
so sad, rip...
Well that was a challenging wank.  RIP genious!
You made me laugh, thank you Sean
Utter utter legend. RIP.
A pure and kind soul that made a lot of the British public laugh and laugh along with him and the team. Much love to him and his family I wish the best to them and may he rest peacefully. He was a genuine guy with a kind heart and a brilliant sense of humour
A comedy hero, will really miss him. Videos featuring Sean Lock are on my most watched on YouTube. Will always make me laugh uncontrollably, a legend.
It still doesn't feel real,one of the first comedians i ever fully "Understood",may he rest in peace <3
I cant belive it, One of the, or the best comedian on tv. ❤️
I can't believe this fellas dead what a legend
We will miss you Sean
I will miss him.
Another one gone way too soon. A genius comic mind, never failed to make me laugh. I will truly miss him. R.I.P. Sean
Werner Herzog laughing at the RNLI joke made me giggle a lot
I can't believe this. RIP.
Carrot in a box was Sean at his absolute best I think.
Nice one mate.
Sleep tight Sean 🙏
RIP Sean Lock, one of the great pillars of youtube binge laughs. He will forever live on the occasional youtube binge
What a loss... Comedy took a big hit today.
Rest in peace. Hope you'll get a carrot in the box
You cant write tears Jimmy
I hope he's up there somewhere enjoying the tropical paradise of nazi Island. RIP Sean ❤️
Rip
I'm American so this is actually how I found out about Sean's death 😪
Hvil i fred. Tak for timer af morskab, grineflip og underholdning så det gjorde ondt af glæde.
I said “lol this makes it seem like he died” out loud then read the description and gasped. Cant believe he’s really gone. I love his comedy. Thought and prayers to his family and friends❤️
Love you Sean. So grateful we had you. What an amazing man.
Undefeated king of carrot in the box! 🥕🎁what a legend. My sister saw him in Westfields once having a meal with his kids and even then he was pulling funny faces with them and making fun of them. Rest in peace 🕊
Bloody hell this man is a world treasure.
Comic Legend!! RIP
Legend of comedy. RIP Sean ❤
Normally I wouldn’t be that sad about any old comedian passing but Sean is different, hilarious bloke. RIP.
A comedian who was actually funny .....
I was absolutely stunned by the news this morning, and I just watched Sean on TV. Definitely the best "dry' comic I've ever seen, Sean was obviously super talented, and his timing was always perfect lol. I can't even remember how many times he had me cry-laughing just at the opening of Cats does Countdown. Cancer is an asshole. Rest in peace.
What an amazing talent, gone way to early, Thanks Sean for the years of tears you’ve made me cry. You leave a comedy vacuum that will never be filled. May your ashes be spread in Piers Morgan’s eyes.
i'm heartbroken.. rest in peace legend
Literally hours spent watching Seans stuff whilst dealing with insomnia got me through some real rough nights and days just laughing R.I.P
Rip Sean. You’ve given me so many hard laughs. I will never forget you,
What a truly funny man he was
Today we have lost one of our greatest comedians. Effortlessly funny to the bone!! We love and will miss you Sean!! R.I.P. Mate X
Sooo sad....gone too soon....seemed a nice guy and yes he made you laugh.....RIP....😔😔😔👻💔
Absolute legend
Can’t believe they cut out the baby seal clubbing joke! Shame on you 4!
Loved that guy. Watched his antics on countdown over and over and he always made me laugh even though I had watched them many times before.  You will be missed by many. RIP Sean
So now he's sadly passed it's only fitting someone makes the scent he always wanted?! I love Sean so much :(
Cancer is a c**t....
The man. The myth. The Legend. Sean Lock
This should have been half an hour long what a funny guy. R.I.P
RIP to a comedy great
I will miss you Sean ❤️ I hope you are in a happy place, may your soul rest ❤️
I absolutely love Sean Lock and he will always be my favourite comedian. His presence on panel shows in unrivalled in my opinion. The news of him passing hit me hard, what an incredible guy. Feel honoured growing up and watching him <3
What a talent he was,his bit about seal clubbing and the rnli still brings me to tears of laughter…..what a sad day for comedy
Top man RIP
Feels like when Rik died.I didn't know or ever meet either of them and yet ....
When I was at my lowest, I used to watch videos of 8 out of 10 cats does countdown and I absolutely loved Sean Lock. One quote I distinctly remember is when he said: "I've only shown my sensitive side twice. Once, to my wife and once I slowed down for a horse". He had such good chemistry with the others on the show, Jimmy, Rachel, Jon, Claudia, Miles, you name them. He will be so missed. RIP Sean.
❤️RIP Sean. Happy (seal) hunting.❤️
RIP Legend
Absolute genius of comedy. Strange brain
Slowest reaction ever to a sad death. Bit formulaic also. No personal tribute. Not like it was unexpected CH4
I am literally crying with laughter right now.
Fantastically funny, was hoping for the ‘challenging wank’ joke though 🤣🤣
Rip. Honestly heartbroken ❤️
Thanks for all the laughs Sean! RIP you utter legend
Anyone who dislikes this video are just jealous of Seans rectum.
Why is life so cruel, this man was the funniest comedian I’d ever come across, you cannot mention amazing comedians without mentioning his name
No way dude, I thought this video was a joke from the title.. damn that's sad. Rip Sean, you were hilarious.
One of the greatest losses in recent English times IMO
I'm Austrian and my phone regularly gives me messages of some celebrity's death, whose name i don't even recognise. But the great Sean Lock passes on and i don't get anything? Feck off
God bless Sean, RIP.
Such a incredibly talented comedian, I'm really shocked by the news. Theres an episode I watch whenever I feel a little down, it's when Sean loses it at Joe's Poem about naming people's penis. I cry with laughter not only at how funny the poem is but Sean's reaction.. Priceless..  RIP Sean 🙏
I'm South African and have not seen much of his work but his death feels personal. What a brilliant comedian. Rest in peace Sean Locke.
Sean will be missed. Love to his family from California.
Just cry tears of laughter people,  that's what this crazy fella was all about, xxx
I’m gutted 😥
Me like funny man. Me sad now.
was at work when i read the news about his passing, my day was fine up till that point. now nazi island will never be a thing...
Miss You Already Sean
Being American I had never watched a single minute of any of the British comedy tv shows until one day it was in my feed. I hadnt laughed that hard in a while, and Sean was easily the funniest of them all. He would make the other comedians breakdown laughing, that's how funny he was. I could've got abs from all the aching.  I hope he's somewhere launching Thatcher out of cannon and having a pint with the Tiger. rip Sean
Genius.
Forever 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Such a sad loss. He made me laugh so hard many times!
Claudia W at the end look like she was gonna stop breathing at one point! Funny, funny man
Jesus man, he's up there will Billy Connolly as the best comedian ever, very sad may he rest in peace
RIP Sean Lock
He was a master of his craft. Thanks for all the laughs Sean!
Thank you Sean, or all the laughs and light moments.  Rest in Peace kind sir.
RIP🙏🙏🙏 He was such a amazing entertainer n comedian👏✊👏🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Chocking and so sad to hear that my favorite panelist has passed away! A brilliant comedian and entertainer!  RIP Sean❤️
Shaun rest in peace. You have made me cry with laughter over the years I have watched you.truely one of the most sad losses in comedy  for me.too his family my deepest sympathies a great man
One of my favourite comedians. I saw the news today at work and it was a strange empty feeling when I saw the headline.  When I was 13/14 I used to look forward to Friday nights where I would have my one bottle of coke and Mars bar of the week and watch 8 out of 10 cats and every week I knew he was gonna make me laugh. Innocent times. Glad I got to see him live. RIP to a comedy legend.
A comedy legend. RIP
:(
What a great man. Rest in peace.
The rectum of the year segment is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. Sean lock thank you for the laughter 😂😂
I was in total shock when I heard of his passing, I didnt know he had cancer... I'll miss his sarcastic dry wit 😪
You will be missed Sean....     your humour was unique, a challenging wank indeed
Legend.
Witty comedy genius you will be missed…
Nooooooooooooooooo! Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy" Nooooooooooooooooo! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  “You can’t write tears.”  RIP in peace good sir!!
RIP
RIP MAN ! He was rather dry , never really got his sense of humour ! Greetings from Portsmouth England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I thought it was a hoax when I first saw the news... Sean you have helped me more times than I can count. These montages would make any day better, I'm sure it'll continue to be. I hope his family and friends are doing ok
A truly brilliant and funny bloke, RIP Mr Lock
RIP Sean. You Will Be Missed.
The only celebrity death that truly upset me. So shocking that he died so young. My favourite comedian. Sean Lock's routines get more funny the more you watch them, not less. Many artists die long after their peak; sadly, we lost Sean Lock whilst he was still at his. He is a truly unique comedian, a unique blend of dark, surreal, physical, witty and observational comedy. He will be sorely missed.   I am not sure I ever saw any other panel show participant reduce the other members of the panel to tears so many times... Thank you for the laughs. We will miss you very much. If only we could have had you for longer.
Can't wrap my head around it. Already miss him, there isn't anybody else like him. But it's telling to his character that even though I'm sad for his death, I'm still laughing at these jokes after hearing them 100's times. This video could be 24 hours long and it still wouldn't capture the full extent of his genius. RIP Sean.
I’ve put 8 out of 10 cats and 8 out of 10 cats does countdown on my all4 list so I can watch Sean Lock as often as possible you will be missed Sean such a loss a great man and comedian RIP.
Sad news.
So sad such a legend
I still can’t quite believe the news. My boyfriend and I were big fans of his and always loved watching him on Channel 4. We loved his dry and daring sense of humour. You don’t see enough of it. Rest in peace Sean x
Legend
Man, What a Legend
So so sad and so shocking! Xx watching this is emotional to say the least! Rest in peace xxxx
Real sad when someone who brings so much laughter to others passes away. Time to pull out my Lockipedia DVD I've watched many many times and enjoy again. Thank you so much for all the laughter Sean.
Thanks for the many hours of laughter, R.I.P Sean Lock from N Z
This is so sad. I'm American and just found Sean about 3yrs ago. R.I.P.
Brilliant man.
Genius. Sad loss.
Laughed for hours because of him, a brilliant comic genius will be greatly missed by all comedy fans, RIP sean lock from all.comedy fans in Ireland.
Awww... Sean
Great comedian, he will definitely be missed.
Sean was the heart of this show. Without him it was only a pale imitation and he will be sorely missed going forward
So so sad and so shocking! Xx watching this is emotional to say the least! Rest in peace xxxx
He was the reason I watched countdown, very sad.
Oh my god, so this is happening NOW! I clicked on this video "by accident". I was shocked when I saw the "RIP" at the end! Then I checked the comments and saw that they are very-very recent!! I haven't heard this news yet, and this is unbelievable! This is a great loss!!! It leaves a vacuum inside of me. He was one of a kind. RIP
RIP
Rest in Peace
We’ll miss you, you “challenging wanker”!  😌
💋 cheers Sean
One of the absolute funniest ever
I don't typically care about celebrity deaths, as they don't impact my life much, and I feel no personal connection to them, but when I heard about Sean this morning, I was genuinely saddened. I've been obsessed with panel shows since I found them many years back. We don't have anything quite the same in the US. Sean has been a staple of the majority of my favorite panel shows since the beginning, and has always given off a hilarious uncle vibe, and it feels almost like I've lost my favorite uncle today. The world is at a loss. With everything we have to bring us down every day, we now have one less thing to bring us back to center, and that's something I feel that's desperately needed in this world. Even in the past weeks people have sent me clips of him doing "carrot in a box" and his "difficult wank" comment from 8 out of 10 cats. I'm sure his loved ones are gutted right now, but I hope they find solace in knowing how much joy he brought the world during his lifetime. RIP Sean Lock.
🙏🏾🙏🏾
Super sad thanks Sean RIP mate
That will be odd for mot people reading this but I basically learned English with this show... I did some classes in school and a course, but never really practiced, and it was when I discovered 8/10 Cats does Countdown that I started to practice the different accents and such, and then I went on to others shows, but it was Sean, Jon and Jimmy that got me hooked, and often I would watch an hour-long compilation of the show... And since I'm not from England, I don't really see news about personalities from there, so this caught me off guard 😥😥 my sentiments to the family and friends, and may he rest in peace 🕊️
Rest in paradise legend💚
WHAT!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
RIP Sean .
Absolute Legend RIP
Shocked. What an amazing comedian he was. Almost shed a tear with that final RIP Sean Lock message. So very very sad.
He is missed.
One of the very best to ever do it. My thoughts are with his family and the people he worked with on 8/10 cats and beyond, noooooo whyyyyy noooooo ahhhhh
I just discovered Sean Lock not too long ago and I was instantly hooked to his hilarious style of comedy. He could make some of the most masterful comedians die of laughter. I wish we had more Sean Locks in the world. Rest in Peace
I cried with laughter and now I cry with sadness and laughter.
Genuinely gutted to hear of his passing. His 15 Storeys High sitcom is an underrated masterpiece. Rest in peace you funny, funny man.
The acidic rainbow unprecedentedly list because antarctica visually charge off a foolish peer-to-peer. sweet, dear plain
He was one of a kind...loved this man...never knew what he was going to say next...but you could bet it was going to be hilarious...RIP mate...sadly missed....
Love this guy. One of the greatest comedians I’ve seen and watched. Your gonna be greatly missed and thanks for so many many laughs.. RIP Sean Lock☹️😢
Oh my goodness, this is awful to hear.  You'll be sorely missed, Sean. And even in death, you will continue to bring laughs for many years to come.
Nazi island will forever be my favourite Sean Lock joke on this show. Such a legend of a comedian!
An incredibly funny man. Timing, wit, delivery outstanding. A good soul :(
terribly sad news today. naturally hilarious. he could write a joke about a paprclip and it would be funny. check out his julian assange line from 8 out of 10 cats. seen it 50 times and it still makes me laugh!. rest in  peace sean.
R.I.P sir, the world of comedy has just lost one of its brightest stars
this one hits hard..... amazing comedian....
Sean will keep on cracking jokes, both to us on earth thanks to videos like this, and to those around him, wherever he’s gone to rest easy. Sleep tight Lock, we’ll keep your comedy alive.
The beginning where Jimmy tries to define Sean. Right now the most appropriate 4 letter word to describe him is inappropriate given what happened recently.
R. I. P. Sean Lock. Missing you massively.
Video should be 1 hour long. Guess 5 minutes is all he meant to channel 4. Got to push out a fucking video as fast as possible to get them clicks. Maybe I'm just a cynical asshole. But it feels disingenuous. Regardless, my heart goes out to Sean's friends and family. But for some reason, this rubbed me the wrong way.
RIP
So very sad. It's like losing a friend! I'll genuinely miss Sean Lock.
Legend……absolute LEGEND😢😢😢😢😢💔💔
Sean gave us Endless hours of laughter. Blessings to his family at this sad time. ❤
I watch him everyday.  In the USA it took me some time to find him. You will be missed. Carrot in a box makes me laugh everytime. RIP and I hope you knew how much people loved to laugh with you.
I was just watching clip of his carrot bit and now he's gone! I'm in shock
If I could like this video twice, I would! Oh and cure cancer...like this video twice and cure cancer 😅
I've watched the Carrot in a Box video so many times. He was a comedic genius. So many of my favorite moments from 8 out of 10 Cats and Countdown were from Sean Locke. He will be missed.
The world is not as good today as it was yesterday. Rest In Peace And God Bless You Sean.
Hope Jimmy does a eulogy... and puts a carrot in the box
“Mmm. Wasps cooked in their own business”. . . . I shed a tear at the news that Sean had died earlier. I haven’t done that for someone I’ve never met before. I’ll really, really miss him. Bye Sean. And thank you.
Sad to know his humor ends here.    Thanks for the laughs!
Such a one off. RIP Sean Lock.
Will be greatly missed
Rest in peace Sean.
What a sad day, a genius of the straight faced story telling comedian, slayer of audiences, has gone.. His dead-pan delivery was spot on.. Thanks for the stomaching laughter fests and witty one-liners too. Rest easy Sean, condolences to your Family and friends at this time.. :(
I just learned of his passing. Thanks for the laughs Sean! RIP!
Hard to believe we lost two rectum of the year finalists in 2021…
This is so sad. This guy has given me so much joy and happiness, so many laughs. Helped me through rough spells time and time again. I almost cried earlier
Making someone (Claudia) laugh so much she was crying and asked him to 'stop speaking', that is talent. 8 out of 10 cats does countdown will never be the same without him.  Condolences to his family and friends.
R.I.P Sean Lock... A.K.A Mr Jangles LEGEND.
my best to  his family and all  those he has brought laughter to . we have all  lost when we loose the ones that  make us laugh
Shocked by the news. A truly funny man. Hope he's wowing them upstairs.
This guy was a genius.  🥕  in the 📦  enough said  RIP Mrs lock.
😭😭😭
What a shock, & sad loss 😕
This is absolutely gutting. My dad passed away almost 2 years ago from cancer and during his final months, watching Countdown compilations helped me take my mind off what was coming. RIP Sean. Thank you for the laughs and the hilarious mascots (Claude being my favourite).
This is so sad. A great comedy genius, made it look so easy..
Sad loss. Cheers for making me laugh. R.I.P
Oh my God! I am in shock, didn’t know…
R.I.P funny man. You’ll have them pissing their pants up there. 😂
Oh Sean, all that seal clubbing and embezzling from the RNLI was bound to take it's toll....... ;)
For f**ks sake.
I can’t believe he’s dead. Rest In Peace you beautiful man
Life's so bloody short - blink and you'll miss it, really.
Rest in peace legend. He’ll be remembered by so many as the greatest comedian to have ever lived. No one can do it so effortlessly like him. His chemistry with Miles on the show was my favourite. Thank you for all the laughs over the years
He was THE Highlight in the Channel 4 lineup. I laughed so much and so hard watching him.
Wait what? Awh man... He once said "You cant write tears, Jimmy." And damn well he was right.
God bless Sean Lock. His humour and wonderful mind will live on through the internet for years to come.
Fantastic comedian. Simply a joy to watch, a huge loss.
I'm shocked and saddened by his passing. Rest in peace Sean. You were a comedic genius.
He is the reason I watch british panel shows. Just 2 days ago I randomly watched a couple of best bits with him again and nearly pissed myself laughing. The news that he passed on broke my heart, even more because its my birthday today.  I will always remember him and his wit. <3 Lots of love to his family and his friends from germany. <3
Legend
Very sad 😞will be missed
Gonna miss the bloke. So many laughs. So sad to hear the news when I woke this morning.
thank you for all the laughs sean, rest in peace 🤍
I've watched Sean Lock for years and I never realised until till now he's probably one of my favorite comedians! The thought of it being no more is a horrible feeling, and with celebrity deaths I don't usually give a sh*t 😞
What. Didn't know he died?! Damn, this put a damper on my night.
Someone said 'I'll remain grateful for the laughs you brought me' and I think that's it, grateful. I wasn't a massive follower of Sean necessarily, but everytime I did see him on TV, whether it was QI or Would I Lie to You, he'd always find a way to make you laugh. And in the grand scheme of things, I think I needed those laughs. Thank you Sean, rest easy.
One of the very best, so sad to lose him at such a young age. Condolences to his family.
RIP to another great man, taken by cancer
Because of Sean I ensure I don't get wet. That way I'll won't be attacked by a sharks. RIP Sean
Great comedian, always a real laugh - 8 Out of 10 Cats was at its best when he was one of the team captains. Thoughts with his family at this difficult time. RIP Sean.
A true legend of comedy.   Rest Easy Sean.    Never Forgotten, Always Missed
RIP 🙏🏼
You'll be missed Sean. Absolutely hilarious. Thoughts must go out to his family.
I’m fairly new to the insanity that was the Sean Lock world.  To see his panel mates not be able to control themselves when he spoke was absolutely eye watering.   This loss and Robin Williams are absolutely devastating to comedy.   May he be at peace and his loved ones absolutely be warmed by the fact that his comedy will be making people happy for a long long time.
So sad to hear about his passing, brilliant comedian. Rip fella.
Such a great comedian, will be missed!
“I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex tonight” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rip Sean,  you never failed to make me laugh and you'll be missed immensely.  My thoughts go out to any and all of his  family and friends . Fly high buddy.
He will be missed.
A bona fide genius. He could genuinely make me laugh until it hurt. As a comedian, top-draw, and always came across as a lovely guy, too.
My favourite was the naked suit,laughed til I cried.
Cheers, Sean! Thank you for the laughs.
Shawn noooooooooooo, ahhhhhhhhhhha, whyyyyyyyyyyyyy nooooooooooooooo
Carrot in the Box is how I have introduced so many friends to this Legend!!! RIP Sir…. RIP.
Devastating loss. A great comedian.
The last 18 months have hit everyone hard, seems that even God wanted a few laughs too. Love you Sean RIP
Rest in peace. Really sad news and thoughts with his family ☹️
He was one of the greatest. So quick witted and always pushing it to the agenda that everyone is scared of. We need more of Sean Locks in this world. Truly missed and best wishes to family and people who personally knew him. Such a talent. In the clouds with Rik Mayle pissing god off. RIP
Such a talented man, watching him live was fantastic as well, the way his story's just build and build was, and still is side splitting funny😂 RIP Sean, we'll miss you
Shocked and speechless. “Rectum of the year” “Seal clubbing trolley dash” “You can only get a tape worm eating pork” “Tiger that went to the pub” “Bring back the Nazi’s” Many classic comedy lines that only Sean could deliver. RIP and thanks for the laughs.
Sean's comedies had help me through the toughest time in my life.
He saved my sanity and humour in my darkest times. Forever grateful 💕
He was such a great comedian and will be sadly missed.
Rip legend.
This man has made me laugh to the point where not only my face, not only my shirt, but my waistband was wet with tears. The joyful grouch, the gleeful curmudgeon, the legend.  I thought there would be more. I was greedy.  Love to all of us who loved him, and love to all those he loved back even more.
Worse news all year. 😭
Rest in peace to a true legend of British tv
challenging wank . . . RIP
RIP Sean
Devastating loss. I challenge anyone to not cry with laughter watching any of his funniest moment reels. Thoughts are with his family. K
He was the only one of his kind and we will always love him ;*
Such sad news. He brought such laughter into our lives. RIP Sean. You will be missed.
I just can't believe this
Damn it!!!!!!!!!!!
What a loss
“Yeah, I wouldn’t get freaked out [if I was in space], cause what’s the big deal? I mean: ‘Oh, I’m in space!’ Yeah… Same shit, different view.” — Sean Lock, 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, 2017-01-13  “Laid-back, Sean is best described as ‘happy go fuck yourself’. Sean never fails to see the funny side of life—it doesn’t matter whether he’s shouting at a child or dropkicking a kitten, you always see him laughing.” — Jimmy Carr, 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, 2012-08-24  “Sean is a pessimist. In his World, the glass is very much half-empty, and also smashed and being used to threaten someone who looked at him funny.” — Jimmy Carr, 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, 2015-01-09
One of my favourite comedians and always will be. Rest easy Sean and condolences to his family. And to Brian and Margaret, you pair of tossers.
R.I.P Sean Lock, you brought much happiness to my life when it was at it's lowest pints. Thank you Sir you absolute legend.
Undisputed king, and champion of "Carrot In A Box"  Rest in peace Sean. Gone.. But NEVER EVER Forgotten
RIP
Rip Sean! One of the highlight of the cats crew!
Absolute legend. He will be sorely missed 😢
He was the funniest on 8 out of 10 cats...I don't think I can watch it anymore now  R.I.P Sean Lock 😞
I’m really gonna miss Sean Lock on this show, such a witty man, came up with some mad stories and inventions.  RIP Sean, gone too soon
RIP Sean, his comedy has helped me and probably a lot of people through tough times and will continue to do so.
All I ever wanted was to live inside of his brain.
Rip Sean
Gutted. My favourite comedian. So glad I got to see him live, albeit about 20 years ago. He was supported by Noel Fielding. I think people forget with Sean's TV work how surreal he used to be. He made Noel's material seem like standard obversational stuff. RIP Sean 😔
Extremely saddened by this premature passing of a comedic genius...his quick wit and deadpan combination will never be matched.   Thanks for the side splitting memories Sean. RIP.
Completely shocked today when I heard the news today about Sean's passing. He made me laugh to tears always. Such a fantastic comedy mind and flawless delivery. Rest easy Sean and thank you.
Would loved to have had a couple of pints with Sean down the pub.  You're already missed, Sean. Sleep well you cute man.
No one could ever replace him, and I’ll never forget him.
Why would someone remove the part with the seal clubbing? And where’s the carrot in a box?
I'm still completely shocked by this news, what an absolute legend 🙌
He got me to the point were I was struggling to breathe I was laughing so much. R.I.P.
Absolute legend
One of the greats.  Really in his element on panel shows. I'll forever be grateful for the laughs. Love to his friends and relatives Xx
I am completely gutted by this, this Video is how I learned of his passing and it was just today. He will be missed a great deal.
godspeed
What an amazing comedian he was.
Legitimately gasped. He was amazing, RIP.
Such a funny guy. Didn’t even try and yet he was the best one on every show. Such a shame he’s gone but he was such a hilarious guy he will bring joy for many years to come ❤️
RIP Sean. Thank you for all the laughs!
no carrot in a box?
Can't believe it I just saw a video of Sean Lock in  a YouTube video talking about a food bank  charity then the next video was about how he has died and I thought it was a joke thought  typical Sean I'm in shock really like him just being funny.
Legend rip
Very sorry to hear about his dead. God bless him
Thank you, Sean.
I'm so sad, he cheered me up so often. I hate getting old and seeing everything just fade away.
What a legend!! I’ve stolen that 4 letter word in a dictionary joke many a time!! You’re gonna be missed sean!!
This is terrible news. RIP Sean Lock.
Thanks Sean for all the many laughs...and the lessons in Household Efficiency that will stay with us forever...Rest In Peace...
A tremendous loss for humanity and comedy alike.
He was the reason I watched 8 out of 10 Cats, and his chaotic humour brought a laugh and a smile to my face many a time. Rest in Peace.
Sean Lock, the endless fits of laughter. Every night I tune into Countdown to get my daily dose of you before going to sleep. Tears tonight, but not with laughter. RIP my hero. Xxx
One of the best in comedy, always had me laughing. Rest in Peace
Best bit for me was when our 'shampoo ad girl' begged him to stop talking! Rest easy Sean, you ledge bag
Comedy great and inventor of Blue Rat, cheers and rest in peace Sean.
RIP Sean. A true comedic genius, and a man who will be sorely missed!
I can't believe he's passed. I saw Richard's tweet and thought, this is a real shit joke. Rest in peace, Sean
Life is legacy and may not have been personally my favourite comedian but appreciate someone who was talented and sorely missed, his laughs will make people alone remember. RIP Sean
FOOOOKING LEGEND OF A MAN!
10 years back, I binged 8oo10c when I was going through stuff.  I'm stunned.  Idk what to say really.  Thank you Sean + crew for helping me. RIP You legend.
That Carrot skit is some of the funniest stuff you'll see. A true comedy Legend RIP
I can't help but react with deep emotion. Very Sad.
So effortless and natural with it. Thank you and R.I.P..
RIP. Thanks for the laughs. x
An amazing comedian. Forever remembered💜💜
Sad to hear about this today, may he rest in peace, thoughts and prayers to the family
Wow. I didn't know he had cancer or that he had passed. I am so sorry. 8 out of 10 cats will never be the same.
Just a droll funny old bugger.  Loved his comedy.  Fecking funny.
He was by far the funniest guy on Countdown
Devastated is an understatement. I’ve always had Freeview until very recently, this show had a reminder set on it every time it was on. Sean Lock was an absolute genius and his wit is unmatchable. RIP Sean 🙏🏽
One of the best of all time! Crying laughing RIP
RIP, Sean.
I started watching the show because of him. RIP. The laughs and entertainment he’s brought and provided will be remembered forever.
RIP Sean, as usual I had tears in my eyes at the end of the Rectum of the year bit. You will be greatly missed. Condolences and love to your family. Pete
Love this man and his comedy. RIP Sean. You'll not be forgotten 🙏
Such sad news today … Sean was a legend such comic genius so quick witted I don’t think the rest of his fellow cast or comedian friends will ever forget this sad day … RIP and god bless you for your laughter you brought into our lives
A Superb Human Being. PS everyone... "15 Storeys High" was sublime.
One word. Legend🙌🏻
I've recently been on a Sean Lock marathon, so the timing of this, only doubles the pain. Loved the twisted brain of his. May he rest in peace
We zullen je missen rust zacht
Another legend we have lost to early 😔
A truly sad day in the comedy world. 😢
What a guy this is fucking horrible
Best comedian. Surely will be remembered.
RIP - thank you for the laughs
Ouch.  My age.  Way too young.
My heart is with you Britain… the first comedian to play at Wembley Stadium.
I can't fucking believe it. Rest in peace and love you absolute legend, you're one of the greatest of all.
Man...
I honestly can’t believe he’s gone, it seems surreal to me😔
RIP sean .you  will  be  rembered as one of the greatest comedain ever .many a great laff i had  listening to you .  Id be sore laffing.
One of the greatests, ever.
Death is a certainty but we all have the power to choose living over existence. The power to make people laugh was such a gift he brought home to all of us ❤
Thank you for all the laughs ❤️ rest in peace
This tribute should be hours long to do Sean justice
2:30 howling! Legend! RIP far too young.
NOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOO AAAAAAAAARGH
Well, shit.. all the best of wishes to his family. What a hilarious man.
Seen these clips so many times. Still crying with laughter now.  Rip sean, you were one of  kind.  Whoever gave this a thumbs down is definatey not a 'cute' but the other one.
I still have my Newman and Baddiel live from Wembley in the early 90's on VHS where a young Sean pops up in a few places. Since then he's NEVER failed to make my entire family fall about laughing. Love you Sean RIP
I've been watching this show for years on the internet from the U.S. and this guy never failed to make me laugh. I don't know how many times I've watched "Carrot In The Box" and "The Tiger Who Came For A Pint" and I still bust out laughing. Thank you, Sean. You will be missed here in the States.
thank you so much for the laughs you crazy hilarious man, you are going to be missed
Sometimes when you don't want something to happen. You can't comprehend that it has. Shot for the laughs Sean Lock
Thanks for the laughs 🙏🏻
What everybody else has said and more. Will be so sadly missed. Love to his family.
I miss him already
I've never seen his standup, but he is one of the best panellists I've ever seen. His savage humor was incredible. He died young, my age. RIP. Love from America.
Laughed out loud to that.  Never saw him live but always enjoyed him when he was on something I was watching.  Saddened today by the news 😢
He was well funny
Thanks for making me laugh, Sean.  Gone 30 years too early.
I’m Crying with sadness at the same time crying with laughter only Sean Lock can do that.
Shed a tear for the loss of this man, so many great moments from him. Loved everything he did. Long may he live on in the future of comedy
RIP Sean.
You genuinely amazing man. Thank you all the laughs over the years I hope the end was not too bad, wherever you are now I hope you’re making yourself smile and laugh. Be a huge miss
💔
Just gutted, what a gigantic loss to comedy
Thank you for the laughs, Sean. Rest in peace.
Venturing into the cryptocurrency world without the help of a professional trader and expecting profit is like turning water into wine,you would need a miracle,that's why I trade with Mrs Prisca Brooks. Her skills are exceptional.
That's a challenging w..k 😂😂😂
One of the best 😢👌
RIP You comedy legend. Thankyou for all the laughs you've provided for us over the years. You will be sorely missed.
Rest easy mate. Why has Channel 4 bleeped this, Sean is not for bleeping!!!
Sean was fantastic
"It's from a  canal" brilliant!😅 RIP you legend.
Heart broken! Such a gentleman and so bloody funny!
Thanks Sean.. for everything! <3
Thank you for all the laughs, even though watching old clips will make me sad, they then will make me burst out laughing which I will always be grateful for. We will miss you, the show won't be the same without you. RIP Sean <3
RIP, genius of comedy.
Oh my god. RIP.
Anyone got his 'assange' joke clip?
absolute legend, he will be greatly missed
A tragedy to hit british comedy… Growing up with QI, he was one of my favorites… May he rest in peace…
I can't think of anyone who kept me sane through lockdown more than Sean.
Sitting here watching the tribute and crying 😢 this has been a sad day
Oh why couldn't it have been Michael McIntyre ?   God is so cruel.
Both sobbing and laughing watching this.  It's so heartbreak that he's gone.  We're so lucky to have had him.
A great loss. We'll always have his smile and jokes, but damn is cancer brutal. If any of Sean's friends or family see this, we're thinking of you.
Is he dead?
You can’t name any comedian like him
RIP legend, he will be missed.
Absolutely brilliant!! often had me crying and in pain through laughing. Will be so missed.
Sorely missed. I will always laugh for Sean and his fucked thought process!! Much love xxxx
who would ever dislike this video..?
Such a sad loss, 58 is nothing. Great man. RIP Sir.
Rest in peace Sean, thanks for the many laughs.
utter legend
Absolute legend!! 💔
What? No😭😭
RIP Sean! ☹
What a man
crying brb
For a brief second while watching this, I had forgotten the sad news of his passing today. The laughter just took me to a place of everything being fine. He will be missed.
Love you Sean 😭😭😭😭
This fella was just one of the boys . Patter was 2nd to none.
A Truly brilliant person
I can't believe it! He will be missed
Rest in peace Sean, thank you for all the years of laughter you have given us.
R.I.P Sean Lock. You were unlike any other. I got into Spine-In-A-Sack because of him, and now it is my favourite game to play.
It just doesn't feel real Rest In Power
Rectum of the year is one of the funniest things I've ever heard I was literally in tears laughing my condolences to Sean's family I was shocked to hear of his passing will be sorely missed RIP
"You get it from pork. Not from anything else."  RIP Sean Lock. You will be missed.
RIP Mr. Lock. I hope you and Diego Maradona agreed to a rematch for rectum of the year in the presence of The Almighty.
LEGEND!! RIP 🙏🏽
He’s made so many laugh so often. I rewatched the bit about him not spitting on another panelist and lost it. RIP Sean, one of the greats.
man you see i don't watch much british TV but 8 out of 10 cats (+ does countdown) is something i always watched. sean never failed to make me laugh. i remember about a month ago i was going on a sean lock binge of his funny moments. this genuinely shocked me because he is so fun to watch and never failed to make me smile. Rest In Peace.
RIP, you will be missed Sean <3
I am totally shocked. I really don't know what to say, other than rest in peace 😢. My condolences to his family.
Yeah... we all loved Sean. A real bloke with a funny bone in every limb. Can say he was one if the very best of the modern day comics..... At least the fas,cist glo,balists didn't cancel him too....
Has he died?
It was such a shock when I heard, it made me so sad. He was effortlessly funny, he made it look easy and he will be sorely missed. I hope he's clubbing seals in heaven.
“The money I embezzled from the RNLI”. Absolute comic genius. RIP Sean.
Terrible day for rain. The world is just so slightly less funny without him here now, I think.
RIP Sean lock funny funny funny man very kind and generous and thoughtful and comedy gold legend
Sean never failed to cheer me up with his genius
Rest in Peace, Sean.
What a legend ...absolutely hilarious...& seemed like a nice genuine bloke
If Channel 4 was actually going to make a proper tribute, this video should be at least 3 hours long. Where's the rest of this compilation?
I found countdown on youtube december 2020, the carrot in a box clip got recommended too me. That was the darkest time in my life where my depression was worse than ever. The clip instantly got me hooked and i started binging every countdown   episode with Sean on becuase i fucking adored his type of comedy and the banter between Sean Jon and Jimmy was something i've never seen before in a comedy show before and it literally saved me. Because of laughter on a daily basis i found the strength to go the therapy and today i'm a new person that can barley comprehend how i could've ever felt the way i did and i really do think that's partly thanks to Sean.   Thank you Sean and RIP
Genuinely funny guy. So sad to hear he has passed. Ironically when I was told he died I was waiting for the punchline as I thought it was a joke. He will be massively missed by friends and fans. But our love and thought has to be with his family right now.
It is amazing how much entertainers can touch peoples lives. You didn't know me but you gave me such laughs and joy. Thank you. So sad knowing you're gone. You will be so very missed.
He will never be replaced, that's for sure.
Legend
A true comedy legend. Thank you so much for all the laughs. You will be missed by so many people. Rest in peace and go trade epic banter with God.
Being in Canada, I was only exposed to Sean through YouTube this past year, via content that is years old. Pure genius. RIP
I miss him already even though I never met him
Well, at least Jon won’t lose that Carrot in the Box game anymore.  In all seriousness, it’s surreal to find out that Sean Lock has passed. Countdown won’t be the same without him.
Everyone saying how tragic he's gone. My face is glad he's gone. This bastard left my cheeks aching for hours.    The good always die young. 58 this day and age is too young. Rest well 💜  (He did love a Scottish purrr-ple)
carrot in the box champion. undisputed.
A true comedy genius, Rest in peace sir
R.I.P. and thanks for all the laughter!
Shall we petition Hugo Boss to make an after-shave called Sean Lock?
Such a genius comedian, thank you Sean for making us laugh through all these years, R.I.P
A comedian with superb delivery. I'll miss having new laughs from him but will always look back at the old ones. RIP.
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! NOOOOOOOOO!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!  RIP THE LEGEND
what a shitty day. Just yesterday I watched one of his last 8 out of 10 episodes and was worried about him.... Can't believe he's gone. My heart goes out to his family and friends....
A unique talent gone and the world a little bleaker now. RIP
RIP. Love from Pakistan <3
Shit news...rip to a comedy great
You will be missed ❤️
Thanks for the laughs , old chap .
Rest well, C. U. T. E
Every time he stopped talking to laugh at his own jokes I laughed five times harder.
Rest In Peace to a ridiculously funny man, Comedy has a lost a great.
Genius... Sean has made me laugh more than anyone on TV. I love him.
Sadly never again will Miles Jupp have to hope that he won't be subject to spittle during post-show coitus.  Goodbye to one of the naturally funny comedians of all time.
I’m genuinely devastated.
I feel like my favourite weird uncle has passed. He'll be missed.
Guess he'll never get to grow old while driving around in his car that is a moving speaker while blaring audio books. R.I.P Sean Lock
Rest in peace Sean, brilliant comedian. You will missed. :(
"That`s a challenging wank" will go down in 8 out of 10 does countdown history
RIP
The man was a genius! 🤗
I feel like I lost a friend, honestly. I’m speechless, rest in peace Sean, you will be dearly missed 😔
You hear about famous people dying everyday..but to hear this today hit me hard, somehow. I loved his ability to make me laugh at things I thought I couldn't laugh at, his uniqueness. Condolences to his loved ones.
R.I.P , brillliant complication that displays his comedic genious !
So sorry from the U.S. Terrific guy. RIP.
3:02 Cheers, friend! May the heavens be a funnier place with your presence!
R I P Sean Lock xxx
A talented man who will be had to surpass   Laugh to us from above 👍
Really loved Sean. Watched all of his specials and how much he help me feel better every day. He will be truly missed.
Few people make me laugh out loud but this comedic genius often did and will be sorely missed. "Total comedy" *stamp*, *stamp* He's in. National treasure
Can’t believe I was unaware he was going through soo much! R.I.P Sean you brought a lot of happiness to this world ❤️
Just laughed then cried. Gutted 😢
Carrot in a box Challenging wank Won’t spit on you when we’re having sex Seal clubbing trolley dash Nazi island No one can ever replace this man’s genius. We will all miss you Mr Lock. A giant among comedians. 😢😢😢
RIP Sean. The comedy world and all its followers will miss you.   I'd like to think that you and Diego Maradona are having a Rectum of the Year rematch in the sky, do us proud.
Love you buddy, RIP
American here who never knew of him until quarantine, when the algorithm started serving me up Cats Countdown. He genuinely made a tough time more bearable, which is about the highest calling there is.
Rest in Peace Legend
What a legend 😢😢
Screw cancer, we will miss you Sean. RIP
💔💔💔
I only found out about him and this show this past year. Thanks for all the laughs, mate. You were one of a kind.
Carrot in a box surely?
He felt like a family member. I’m crying. Rest in piece Sean.
Today after a terrifying 4 weeks i basically got the news that i don't have cancer, then i found out Sean Lock died of it, cancer seriously sucks fat dick.
Can’t believe he’s gone ,
Good man,   RIP.
❤️‍🩹
Sadly taken from us far far t too soon, A true comedic genius. RIP  SEAN
The man the legend Sean lock  Rest in beautiful slumber big man Your definitely one of the greatest comedians and will never be forgotten
Sean was my saviour on so many occasions. I actually collapsed today when I heard the news. Never met him but felt he was a massive part of my life. I almost knew what he would say before he opened his mouth. His punch lines were hidden, usually within the narrative, so funny I would cry with laughter. Great atheist and human being, he was right!
Rest in peace. One of the best.
This video should have been at least two hours long. We lost a legend today.
An amazingly funny man.
So shocked at this news
So unfair. Sleep well Sean...
You’ve earned your wings Sean
Never been so sad to see someone pass. RIP to an absolute comedy icon and quick witted genius. Rest well
I can't even explain how hard this has hit me. With YouTube and sat channels I legit do not think there has been a day in the last few years where I haven't escaped the world with Cats and Sean Lock. I watch videos of people reacting to it - not only do I still get enjoyment from the bits but I get to see people react to something I love. TV Heaven Telly Hell shows the pure comedic class of Sean. I am truly heartbroken.
I am bummed. I hoped one day I will get to watch you and Jimmy Carr live. Now this just sucks, I am bummed.
RIP
Crying with laughter is the most appropriate tribute to this giant of a man. We’ll miss you Sean.
This man made me laugh numerous times. He will be remembered. RIP Sean. Greetings and respect from Iran.
that was the 511..
Now that really sucks, this guy was so funny,,   I had just discovered him a few months back,,,,,,  never heard of him or 8 out of 10 cats,  half the time I could barely figure out what they were saying or talking about but this guy had me cryin laughin",,,,, he was really really funny.. God bless !!
R.I.P Sean Lock a brilliant comedian😞
I remember when he nearly ended his career by trying to bring back the Nazis. Also, Carrot In A Box - one of the high points of British TV in the last 10 years.  He'll be sorely missed.  RIP.
Rest In Peace to the greatest Carrot in a Box champion ever.
Genuinely in tears watching this, absolutely my favourite comedian ❤
Rest in peace funny man ❤️
RIP Sean Lock. You were an absolute comedic genius with sharp acerbic wit. Thank you for 20 years of laughs in my 33 years of life.
So so so sad!!!
Absolute legend, will be very sorely lost but very fondly remembered, has had me in stitches for years
Hilarious guy. RIP 🙏
Absolutely devastated to hear this news. Sean Lock was one of the funniest, quick witted comedians to set foot on this planet. He will be sorely missed. Prayers and thoughts to his family. RIP Sean Lock 😔❤
Sean found himself a niche role in British comedy. His humour was unique and hilarious. He was the glue that held 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown together. To say he will be sorely missed is a huge underestimate. RIP.
🙏🙁
I'm pretty sure I have been watching at least 1 clip with Sean per week for the last 3 years and it doesn't look like I will stop anytime soon. I think I know the whole seal clubbing/rectum of the year bit by heart now
A great loss, will always be remembered and sadly missed❤
RIP Sean funny funny man thanks for many laughs
Was so hilarious to me, He helped cheer me up alot, will be truly missed. R.I.P SEAN LOCK
That 'Little bit of Zest' has sadly left us all. Such sadness to all who watched and laughed .
Fuck this one hurts bros
Whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy, Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. R.I.P. you curmudgeon.
This is so hard to accept! I've been following this show for the last year, this team became part of my day during the lockdown and, in a way, they helped me with their humour! And now, Sean disappears so suddenly! The _show_ will never be the same. RIP
I can’t believe this. I just found his comedy a few months ago and he was still so young. So shocking!
Literally laughing non stop throughout the whole video, this man would bring joy to so many with ease. RIP Sean, one of the best to ever do it
I'll never get  over his Michael Jackson in Devon impression rip mate
Sad 🖤
My favourite, you will be missed ❤️
💖
This is the worst news all year, such a great and funny man. He will be missed. RIP
NOOOOO!! WHY!!! NOOOOOO!!!! AAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  RIP Sean
A genuine comic genius and a massive loss to comedy.  Rest in peace you grumpy, hilarious man.
Good lad, Sean.
He was a warm and friendly ,  so sad, feel like i lost a friend today.  So sorry for the people who really new him, Great man,

I will miss his humor.
Got me through lockdown and helped carry the show for years, master of his work, RIP Sir 💔

He was the glue that held Cats Countdown together and a brilliant Stand Up. Still making me chuckle from other side and will do for a long time.
:(
Thank you for all the laughs, you will be dearly missed.
A toast of blue rat to Sean Lock. I'll be shaking some snow globes tonight.
Sean Lock was one of the funniest people I have ever watch. May he rest in peace
Damn… feels like yesterday I watched ”Carrot In a Box”😢
Rest in peace. You will be missed 💔
RIP to a legend
Just poured a nice refreshing glass of water on your behalf, cheers Sean
RIP genius
There just is no one else like Sean Lock. Hes now up clubbing seals in heaven.
🖤
I’m devastated at this news :((
Made me laugh a lot.  RIP Sean, make them laugh
This doesn’t seem real.  As one of Sean’s worldwide fans, I can only add that he will be missed in America, too.    On the bright side, the seal population is breathing a sigh of relief.
thanks for making this. he was a legend.
He deserves more than a 5-minute tribute.. 😭😭
RIP
Legend.
Gutted
Remember the national treasure bit he did? He's a yes. RIP thanks for the laughs!! Gutted!
There is less laughter in the world, without your sarcastic and dry wit. Gone too soon. RIP Sean Lock.
RIP Mr Sean
No wannabe smart comments from me...just to say thanks for all the laughs, Sean and wherever you are now make 'em laugh as hard as we did.  Gone too soon, the brilliant Mr Sean Lock.
I started watching 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown during Covid isolation and this man was the center of my laughter during this 2 years we've been locked inside. I will miss you mate.. thanks for everything
Thank you Sean for all the joy you have given us. ♡♡♡
RIP Sean Lock you cheered me up in the darkest times, when ever I felt like shit his clips on YouTube always pulled me out. Thank you for your humour 🙌
I was actually watching 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown videos yesterday on YouTube, and then I wake up to the awful news of Sean's death... It sucks... 😔☹️🥺 Rest in peace, man.
I Need a bottle of boozo to Drink the pain away
Rest in peace Sean you will always be the champion of the carrot in a box but seriously you truly will be missed and thank you so much for entertaining us and making us all laugh.
Rip 🙏
Very funny man
Noooo!!!!!!
I don't normally get sad when I hear of celebrities dying. But I'm truly sad about Sean Lock dying he gave me lots of laughs especially on 8 out of 10 cats. 💔
Rest in Peace King❤❤❤❤
Simply, thank you for the years of laughter.
I've never been bothered by a celebrity death but fuck me, when I woke up to messages of "RIP Sean Lock" I actually felt a bit sick. I have watched his standups countless times, same with both TV and Radio versions of "Fifteen Stories High" which were absolute underrated, underacclaimed genius, every single time he appeared on the screen was an absolute treat, he was ALWAYS the best thing about ANY show he was on. I have laughed until I have been in physical pain so many times while watching that great man.  The fact that he stayed silent about the struggles he was no doubt having just speaks to the mans character, he was old-school through and through, and we will probably never experience anybody as naturally hilarious as him ever again. I'm gonna spend the rest of the night watching through his legacy. Hope his family manage to recover.
RIP
Legend. Rest easy you big silly tosser ❤️❤️❤️
So heart broken. I hope God, if he's there could tell him how much Joy he had brought to pissants like me living all around the world, in times of distress. Thoughts n prayers from India.
Sean was incredibly funny.
What a legend!
Brilliant comedian😪
i never wanted that video to end
My go to for.a.good giggle... Sending love from Australia.. love this guy's humour and entertainment
You half expect this to be a big prank Sean has pulled off, with wit as dark as his! Alas, it is not. So, so sad. One of the finest comics of his generation. RIP you lovely, disgusting, hilarious, clever man. Time to watch 15 Storeys High again I think.
It won't matter at the moment but I hope his family see how loved he was. Comedy legend. We're all the poorer for his passing.
As an a Australian fan of this show and Sean Lock I was generally surprised to learn of his passing.  R.I.P. Seam Lock. You be greatly missed.
Truly gutted to hear of his death. RIP a modern British legend among comics.
Sad to hear about his passing.  Oddly enough I found out about his genius when I was recovering from cancer and spent hours on YouTube searching for something to make me laugh.
I've spent hours watching Sean Lock, stand up, writer...8 out of 10 cats, Im honestly saddened by the passing of such a comic icon...his honesty of values to his brilliant timing will leave a big hole in British Comedy...fav quote " Sean was just telling me how he's on the fence as far as the Nazis were corcerned" just dry...perfect timing...comic brilliance. RIP The Genius Sean Lock.
A genuinely hilarious master of comedy Thanks for hours of laughter Sean
Sean's passing means, among an infinity of losses, that we'll never see the hundreds of hilarious Mascots that surely remained in that fertile brain to the very end.  Thanks for the laughs, Mr. Lock; now you've brought us to tears we didn't want.
😥 So sad. Breaks my heart. R.I.P. Sean 😥
Sobbing.
Man this is painful and not gonna sink in for a while. I watch his videos on a weekly basis just to cry with laughter. The show is not gonna be the same! Legend Sean absolute legend!
Shocked…Very naturally funny man….
Thank you Sean for all the laughter.
Legend
Amazing Legend and will be greatly missed
i know he hated social media but i really wish he could see all these people; young and old who's day he brightened up every time he opened his mouth for decades now.  what a true national treasure, greatest comic and sadly no longer living but nonetheless legend.   no doubt clips of his wonderfully unique one liners that dont get nicked are still watched for many years to come.  rest in peace sean
Such a shock rest in peace mate shows how mortal we really all are!
Happy for the laughs he gave, sad to hear he is gone. 😢🥲
As the funniest panelist on this show, he's a huge reason why this show carried me through the pandemic and still gives me immense joy. He was a legend. Rest in peace, Sean Lock.
I love him, rest in peace. You knew it was going to be amazing especially when he starts to laugh before he finishes the joke & make Jimmy cry ... 5:10
Rest in peace Sean. You'll be missed.
Rip Sean,  TV won't be the same without you on cats does countdown 😢🥺
What a sad day for humour. Another great comic leaves us way too soon.
Rest in peace Sean, your humour got me through some of the worst nights of my life. I can't believe you're gone and I hope that wherever you are you have a pot of winkles and a pint on hand. Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  You can't write tears
I hope his family use the money he embezzled from the rnli to pay for his funeral
Rest in peace Sean!! You always brought me joy and I'm sure you still will. Have fun up there!!
RIP Sean.. a master comic.
Simply the greatest.
RIP
Thanks to Sean i was introduced to the art of Challenging Wanks, i will have one in his name. Maggy thatcher in high heels and a beard oòof!
RIP YOU ABSOLUTE LEGEND
WHAT THE ………….. WHAT? We have to sacrifice an other celebrity to bring him back!!
🤣😍🤣😍🤣😍🤣😍 Noooooooooooooooooooooooo! Whhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhy!
Laughing and crying at the same time whilst watching this. RIP Sean, you will be missed!
Thank You for your humour over the years. Condolences to your family & RIP 😉🥸
Rest in peace 🕊️
One of the funniest men on TV. I’m genuinely gutted with the news of today. Brilliant humour. My thoughts to his family because if I feel sad and I’ve never met him I can’t imagine how big a hole they must have. ❤️ RIP Sean
damn, just watching a compilation like many times over the past year and then see the ending and look at the title..
god. my heart sunk when i saw this and yeah.  he was a legend and cats wont be the same.
Absolute legend!
Thank you for all the laughs sean. RIP ❤
One of the King's from cats does countdown. Rest in peace Sean. I really can't believe it.
It's really really sad. 8 out of 10 cats will never be the same, I don't know how they will carry on with the show without remembering him every time....im not even from the UK but when i was there, it was my favourite show and i was a big fan of Jon and Sean.....my condolences to his family and friends. This is a really sad news....I hope everyone is heaven is having a good time with him
Rest in peace. Thank you for all the laughs
Unbeaten  "Carrot in a box" champ!
💜😢🥺💜
Too soon, far too soon.  Such a funny man.  Condolences to his family and friends.
man, this hit different, sucks, rip sean.
R. I. P you are a funny man thank you for your time
😢
RIP Sean you’ve made me laugh so bad over the years very sad day 🙁
R.I.p mr lock. You will be missed by millions of us, such a funny funny man
He wasnt funny. I did laugh at him once, but only because he died lol
40 people set the sprinklers off...
i wish a very unpleasant and painful life upon those who disliked this video
RIP Sean 'Google can go fuck itself' Lock. Much missed already. My thoughts are with his family and friends.
Fuck, that's some truly shitty news to get on a Wednesday evening (or any other time, for that matter). Such a legend; will be sorely missed.
I didn’t know he passed away! What a tragic loss. I will miss him on Countdown. A truly sad day.
I know I don’t know Sean Lock but this one really hurt. There was no other comedian quite like him and to think we’ll never get to see him again is awful.
Sean is off to the Nazi Island in the sky.  (Hitler's getting hungry!)  Cheers, Sean!
🤍
No matter which episode of 8 out of 10 Cats or Cats Does Countdown you watched, Sean would always be the highlight. If you saw Sean in one of the seats for a panel show, you knew you were in for a treat. Truly one of the greatest comedians. RIP Sean.
God damnit
RIP
Heard the news of his death on the radio on my way home from work and upon hearing it stalled me car  RIP U ABSOLUTE LEGEND 🙌 🙏 🥺
I actually can't watch this RIP
He had me in stitches many times, i will miss him.
"Nazi Island" will always make me laugh. You were a true comedian mate and i will miss you...:-(
Totally heart broken to hear the sad news. He will be missed so much. RIP Sean, condolences to Sean's family.
My 2 favourite jokes aren't in here unfortunately, the "how about I dont spit on you when were having sex later" to Miles, and the "that's that's challenging wank" to Rachel had tears streaming down my face, he was a comical genius,
Trevor Moore and Sean Lock in as many days. How cruel :(  Both will be remembered by those they've brought smiles to for so long :)
just clicked it after seeing Sean Locke on the thumbnail, laughed throughout the video and then realised at the end what had happened.
I'm genuinely sad with this news.. This show made me feel less alone and gave me so much laugh when I was alone in abroad preparing for the uni entrance exam. It'll never be the same without him. Rest in Peace Sean.
Absolute legend ..RIP Sean
I’m shattered. I am just absolutely gutted by the loss of this legend. We will miss you Sean.
He was my depressions kriptonite
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?! Just learning about Sean's passing through a Recommended video :( fuck me
I didn’t even know he was ill. I was a casual fan but was always entertained by him. He seemed like a genuinely nice person, a really sad loss. RIP
R.I.P sean lock you are going to be missed my favourite comedian you legend 🙌
Such a sad loss, he was so funny. My deepest condolences to his family.
Love you Sean.
Holy fuck as an American I have no idea what’s happened I’ve only just woke up and suddenly I want to cry what the fuck???
8 out of 10 cats does countdown just won't be the same RIP Sean Locke
A comedy legend ❤️
He was on my bucket list for go to comedy shows, Youtube will have to do. Rest well Sean x
Rest in peace Sean
I laugh at evil people. They live a good life, but they did nothing but destroy civilization. May they burn.
I usually don't care about famous people dying, but this one feels really weird. I've been watching these shows for years now and it really feels surreal looking at these clips knowing we will never see him in action again.
Never failed to make me cry with laughter, Noooooooooooooooo. RIP Sean.
I actually cried when I heard the news. Obvs I don't know him but he is my hero, what an amazing, fucking hilarious man.  POV: Sean --> sees the world of comedy --> he came he saw he conckered. Me--> my hero 😍 Rip Sean you hero
Absolute comedy genius. Rest in peace Sean.
So very sad to hear this news. One of the very best comedians on t.v.  R.i.p to a very funny normal man. One of the people. ❤
Sean Lock you snapped Me out of thinking to much you made Me laugh, forever grateful, 😢 R.I.P
A star has stopped shining. Sean, you were one of the best. I shall have  a pint on your behalf, you absolute legend. Love.
The world was better with you in it Sean. A devastating loss to your family, my heart goes out to your wife and children. You really were a bit of a legend! Thank you for the laughs RIP
Rest In Peace, Legend.
Rest in peace. Absolutely gutted what a great man.
FUCK i really just cant :(
Being in the U.S., I "discovered" Sean Lock thanks to these videos on YouTube, which led me to start watching clips of his standup and becoming a fan. It came as quite a shock when I started seeing RIP in the comments on one of them I just happened to have been watching this morning. The world is a little less absurd today and it sucks...
Rest in Peace Sean, absolute icon.
RIP Sir
:( rest in peace.
I only hope that his family can find some solace in the absolute joy that he brought to millions. I have no idea how many Cats Does Countdown videos I’ve watched but I know every one of his highlights word for word and still cry with laughter every time. One day Jon might get to beat him at ‘Carrot In The Box’
😔
Bloody legend and undefeated Carrot in a Box Champion. Rest in peace, Sean.
Best line is still "That's a challenging wank"
If you looked up Sean Lock in the dictionary, you'd find this definition: Legend!  Rest in Peace to a comedy genius! His carrot in a box is still a thing of absolute beauty!
RIP Sean.
A brilliant comedian, will be sadly missed. Rest in Peace Sean. 😥
He had cancer issues for a long long time.  Was never gonna let an inch of that to us during his career, even when it was terminal because that was his simple wish.    Before cancer, one of the most encompassing calm individuals I've ever witnessed.
"Rescind a oensioner´s bus pass".
I'm shook.  I can't believe he's gone.
What a shock and a shame. Look up 15 Storeys High for more examples of his brilliance.
One of the funniest people on TV and in stand up. I'll miss his unique mix of wistful and brutal. Genuinely gutted he's gone. RIP Sean Lock.
RIP, gone too soon: (
RIP Sean, you’ve made people cry with laughter and now with your passing. Rest easy fella xx
The profits from this video however big or small should go to a cancer research charity in my opinion
I was always disappointed when cats does countdown came on and he wasn’t in the episode, he has made me laugh since the nineties. He will be sorely missed, but never forgotten.
Truly sad to heat, thank you for all the amazing laughter and joy you brought us, you are already missed.  R.I.P
Rip sean
Legend!! Guy was unreal! Actually made other comedians belly laugh!
I was laughing so hard! Then I saw the R.I.P screen at the end... I wasn't ready for that... Thank you, Sean. Thank you for everything... 😔
Hard to believe it. Absolutely devastating
Rest easy Sean, you are missed but at least we have you on video to make us laugh again & again. The big man upstairs has plenty to laugh about now that he has you, Sean Hughes and Bill Hicks. RIP.
Rest in Peace Sean, you will be very dearly missed, thanks for the laughs
WOW I totally thought that this was going to be a joke tribute until I actually googled Sean Lock & it's real. I didn't even know he was ill .   I am so shocked right now that I honestly can't think of anything else to say except...   RIP Sean Lock. Heartfelt condolences to his Wife & Children & the rest of his Family & Friends both off screen & on.   Much love from Australia
And i thought taliban taking over afghanistan would be the worst thing to happen this week…
Very funny man, great loss to all lovers of dry comedy
A great comedian very sad
Such a dark day for comedy.. RIP Sean
And i thought taliban taking over afghanistan would be the worst thing to happen this week…
That's just fucked up :,( Rest in peace to a Legend!
Nooooooooooo whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Nooooooooooo aaaaaaaaaaaaaah
RIP Sean.
May you rest in peace Sean. Greetings from Czech rep.
Any resolutions for the new year ?  Sean - I wanna become a less considerate lover.

Legend of the comedy circuit, RIP Sean ur gonna be missed
Fantastic comedian and panellist. Never failed to make me smile or even laugh out loud. His comedy and wit will live on forever. RIP Sean Lock.
Thanks for the laughs Sean. I was totally side swiped by the news today. My heart goes out to the family.
This is how I found out he died. Man this sucks to hear 😞. RIP Sean Lock, may your boxes be filled with carrots and his rectum be remembered forever. Diego Maradona ain't got nothing on you Sean!
An incredible comic talent. He had me broken with laughter many times. Far too young, and I’ll greatly miss him. RIP Sean.
I discovered Sean Lock about 2 years ago. Nothing really made me smile in that period but I always got a laugh out of Seans jokes. Condolences to his friends and family
Devastating news. Had a tear I'm my eye hearing this today. A very funny man who never failed to make me laugh. 15 storeys high was comedy genius
Loved this man, absolute comedy genius. RIP legend.
Rest in peace. One of the greatest panel show members ever. So many laughs
gutted
Getting to see him live will always be one of the greatest moments of my life, Rest in Peace Sean
Genuinely devastated.
Sean's the uncle we all wish we had. Rest in peace
The 2 time carrot in a box champ. Rest is peace
Wonderful stuff! The way he had them in stitches/crying with laughter in that last clip is a sure sign of comedy greatness. RIP Sean.
Water I mean it’s from a canal
A comedian that could make other comedians cry with laughter , priceless .
He'll be missed, rest in peace sir
RIP 😢 legend
So sad, he bought so much pleasure to so many. RIP rectum of the year
His children’s book adaptations were comedy gold, Cyril the screw and the tiger who went for a pint  RIP Sean
Such heartbreaking news, I love this guy. One of the best comedies known!
It's so strange to think Mr. Jangles will never be coming up the stairs again. Sean was so effortlesly brilliant. What a loss.
Ah that is sad news….
Saw Sean perform at Warwick Arts centre, and for half an hour someone kept making noise and shouting out, he played it off but finally he went both barrels and said, what's the problem because I don't know if you noticed but people have paid to watch me...  The person's friend then said "tourettes'.  It was amazing to see Sean instantly react to this and handle it with care while being a funny bastard. Will miss him. RIP.
what a human being this man is and forever will be
Ah jesus 😢
One of the funniest comedians to have graced existence and his comedy and personality will be missed. RIP Sean 💕💕
This is how I found out Sean Lock died. That sucks.
Thank you Sean
We will miss u a very very funny man. God help them up there lol
Watching and listening to him was an absolute treat.
I can’t believe this.. genuinely shocked!! He was such a legend! Loved him to bits! My favourite uk comedian hands down!
RIP Sean, shocked, condolences to your family. Your humour kept our family going many a night you were the best, our loss is heavens gain. A true genius  none is better than our Sean💔💔😢😢
Truly can't describe in words ❤️
Thank You Sean, for many years of laughter with tears, But they missed out your greatest ever one liner in my opinion,  Replying to Rachel's skiing attire, with the "Thats a challenging wank" comment, makes me cry with laughing so hard every time i see it. RIP Funny Man.
RIP big guy
RIP. Absolute legend
Can't believe he's gone...
All the love and best wishes from your fans in Canada. Sean always brought tears to my eyes but this was the first time that it was due to sadness.  Thank you for all of the laughter you wonderful man
That's a challenging wank 😂 😂 RIP man. 🇦🇺 🏴‍☠️
R.I.P you legend
Such a hilarious individual who has made me cry with laughter on many an occasion! He will be sorely missed! RIP Sean Lock.
I'm gutted we list a man who makes us laugh  His family has lost his love and warmth  God bless you Sean
What? I'm American. Please tell me this isn't real.
Such a talented, funny and entertaining comedian, with a unique sense of humour. The world is a sadder place today without Sean 😔😔😔. Still can’t believe he’s gone. RIP Sean.
Just like music good comedy will die out.  It’s going to be a bleak boring future.  Glad I’ve lived it now.
I will seriously miss your daring and at times crude humor. And your timing was perfect. I loved every second of it. Thank you Mr. Lock.
Way too young
When I found out about Sean, I stayed up and watched maybe 3 to 4 hours of his stuff.. will be missed
God rest you Sean Lock.. R.I.P
He always made me laugh saw his first stand up show at the Lowry in Manchester will be greatly missed my condolences to his family and friends 😢

This guys made me belly laugh more than any comedian since I used to sit and watch lee evans dvds as a kid. Truly a phenomenal loss.
Sean lock : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! AAAAAAAHHH!
RIP Sean, one of the finest comedians Britain has ever created
My favourite comedian for a long ass time, rest up you absolute legend
Rest in peace Sean. This world became just a little bit darker today when this brilliant beam of comic genius left us. Love to his family.
Truly one of the funniest people on TV RIP Legend
Absolute legend. He'll be sorely missed, but his jokes will live on forever. RIP.

Sean Lock, thank you so much for the hilarious comedy. A brilliant comedian. Will be missed enormously.
💔
nooooooooo whhhhyyyyyyyy nooooooooooooo arrrrrrrggggghhhhh RIP Sean
That’s a challenging wank! Timeless.
Probably my favorite Sean moment was when Joe Wilkinson was reading "the" poem (you know the one...) and Sean was laughing so hard it hurt, and he could barely catch his breath.  All he could wheeze was, "Please stop."  I'd never seen him laugh so hard.  You left us far too soon, Sean, we will miss you!
Still can't believe he's gone. RIP.
Thanks for the laughs.
I literally like can't belive it. I can't picture it  rest in peace the world is in a weird place right now
As Ace Rimmer once said "What a guy" Cheers Sean
Brilliantly funny man with a sharp wit. RIP Sean.
My favourite comedian. Vale Sean Lock. a great contribution to comedic entertainment.  None of the shows will be the same without him. CONDOLENCES to family and friends from Australia. RIP Sean.

Man this is a challenging wank. Only know him from YouTube clips of all these shows and really appreciate his humor. Condolences to his family and friends.
Well that was a difficult wank but we did it... RIP Sean

A sensation, an idea ❤️ Definitely one of the greats, he'll be able to have a right good natter with Victoria wood and the gang 😘
A gem like no other💝he will be missed 💔
One of those deaths that hit harder than you would ever think. The first one for me was Robin Williams. This is almost as bad, and only not as shocking as I’d heard he was sick.  You were taken to soon Sean! I’m going to miss watching you, and I feel for your family! All the love from Sweden.
Gonna miss him so much R.I.P. Sean.
That final frame hurt soo much 😢
Definitely means a friend is gone in our household.
A compilation of Sean's best bits would be several hours long and still leave so many wonderful moments out. The man was a legend. RIP
NOOOOOOO! WHYYYYYY! AHHHHHHH!  (Sean Lock on what he wanted on his obituary)
I just don't want to believe this. A truly unique and wonderful person. RIP you crazy beautiful legend.
Proper funny guy, loved him, will miss his humour, RIP Sean
"That's a challenging wank..." - Got the be my favourite Sean Lock moment.  If you know, you know.
Isn't it sad that all the kind words and plaudits occur most when people can't hear them. Tell someone how much you admire them now because tomorrow is never promised. Rest easy Sean
RIP Mr Locke. May you always have carrot in your box
Amazing comedian. I can't believe he's gone R.I.P.
I’ve never watched a video of Sean lock and not laughed until now, awful news Rest in Peace Sean 😢💔
RIP SEAN
Sean Lock is one of my all-time favorite comedians. This was terrible news to get today. Rest in peace, Mr. Lock. You will be greatly missed and fondly remembered by a whole world.

An absolutely devastating day for the man words can't describe. RIP Sean
Thanks for the laughs, Sean. Truly one of the best.
What a legend this man has been. One of the funniest in the business and an extraordinary personality.
Rest in peace you funny man  So many laughs were had from his particular brand of wit
True absolute fucking legend, “you can’t write tears Jimmy”
Rip 🪦 Sean Lock, I appreciated his humour.
He must of been great to go drinking with. R.I.P.
What happened? He and I are the same age
Jimmy:what would you want your gravestone to say? Sean:idk I would be dead REST IN POWER
Thank you Sean, comedy and music has get me through the pandemic and also being a full time career for my dad, along with also having  arthritis, it was only on Monday I watched one of his gigs on you tube, Sean has had me in stiches when was I truly depressed, that I will be forever thankful, I still can not look a can of red bull and think of blue rat and smile ( 15 stories High, very funny sitcom ).
I hope Miles Jupp displays his Sean Lock picture family heirloom at home with pride.
RIP Sean comedy legend this programme won’t be the same without you 😔
I cannot believe this man has gone from our world… he bought so much joy to so many.. love to his wife & children, he will be missed all over the world. I hope you give them all a laugh on the other side.
That Xmas card thing gets me every time,  hilarious.  RIP Sean.
Really sad Sean a person i never met but who brought me endless joy has passed away he will be missed
Best improvised comedian there is ,u will be missed RIP!!!
We will always have carrot in a box. One of the best things ever!
I found lot of British panel shows during lockdown and Sean Lock has become one of my all time favourite comedians, I think lot of his comedic bits got me through some hard times. I just found out about his passing and I'm devastated, I will miss him and his witty humour.
We have all lost a friend , even if we never met him. The good ones die young.
Reading about his death I wish I could go cancer clubbing, just like a trolley dash! RIP SEAN LOCK P.S. Jon Richardson might finally be able to win "Carrot in a box" now. D.S.
Genuingely the world really lost one of the good ones today. A grumpy old one, but a really good one. I'm gonna miss him dearly. And in the spirit of Sean Lock, let us all remember that he won the carrot TWICE and Jon will never be able to take it back.  -I hope you're in a better place you... well you smiling genius.  Heartfelt thoughts go out to his wife and family that lost a great part of their life, but a life worths of laughter and joy.
I am seriously gutted 💔 he is a comedy legend. You will be missed Sean.
RIP legend
One of the few comedians that made me laugh with every joke. A true legend
Carrot in the box! He’s a comedy legend always in my heart ❤️ RIP Sean
Absolute legend, gone far too soon😔thanks Sean,as someone who's been pretty much bedbound the past 3years, you've given me countless hours of crying with laughter, now to be accompanied by a tear in your memory 😔💜

RIP sean such sad news 😔, not only a seriously funny guy, but he seemed such a geunine nice guy also, an underrated British comedy great if you ask me
One of the best to ever do it! RIP Mr Bo Jangles
Wow, i did not see this coming. what a punch in the heart.  I followed the 8OO10C team for a long time from the Netherlands.  I just love his / their sence of humor. Sean was idd the favorite. Did not know he was ill.   Thank you so much for all the laughs Sean. Rest in Peace.   All the best to the family.
Not many people can be called a legend, but this man is not many people. A unique mind and comedy genius. Rest is peace.
Genuinely one of the only comedians that made me laugh. His sense of humor and the delivery of his jokes were the best. Not usually affected by these things but as soon as I read about his death my heart dropped. Rest in peace sean.
Ahhhh not another one😢 RIP Sean. I’ll forever remember the “the political equivalent of ronseal” line🤣❤️
Whenever I feel down, I either watch Black Adder or 8/10 cats, British humour is amazing, and Sean lock is a huge part of it. RIP
Rest in peace good sir

Gonna miss his riddler gag
Heartbroken 💔
My thoughts are with Sean's loved ones.  He has given me a lot of laughs and joy.
RIP Sean - another amazing comic gone from this world 😔
I've shed tears of happiness so many times with Sean's humour, today they were tears of sadness.  Thank you for seal clubbing, nazi Island and my favourite rectum of the year, brilliant.
Absolutely gutted to hear of Sean's passing.  58 is way too young to go.  Thank you, Sean, for all the laughter you brought to this world.

Think he’s the only guy who could regularly bring Jimmy Carr to tears of laughter.  RIP Sean.
As per your wishes Sean: "Nnnoooooooooo, Whhhhhhyyyyyyyyy, Nnnnoooooooooo, Ahhhhhhhhhhhh" Rest in Peace you hilarious soul.
There are few people in my eyes that are funnier than Sean. He lifted my mood many times, made me absolutely cry with laughter and was honestly the best part of cats does countdown. I will sorely miss this man and I have no doubt many will miss the joy and laughter he brought into our lives. Rest in Peace Sean. A life making an entire nation laugh, is a life well spent.
Rip Sean lock
I'm an American and I first saw Sean Lock on 'Cats does Countdown',  which quickly became one of my favorite shows of all time. I love British humor and loved Seans' comedy. He will be greatly missed. I wish I could be more eloquent, but my words fail me. RIP Sean.
Such a loss 😞
Same age as my dad. That’s petrifying
Rest In Peace Sean. Thank you for the laughs
Finding this hard to believe, R.I.P thank you for laughs
Fly high legend and rest in peace. 💔
I always wanted to meet Sean Lock just so I could shout 'You look like Ian Beale' and if he replied, I'd simply shout 'Baldy'. RIP.
Devastated to hear of Sean's passing, so sad. Just spent the last 5 minutes crying with laughter watching this - RIP Sean
I fuckin' can't believe he's gone... Fuck!
Oh no!  I love seam lock
him promising not to spit on miles when they have sex is probably my favourite moment of his. what a legend, miss him already.
So saddened to hear this news today.  I’ll fondly remember 15 storeys high & his classic gags on Cats does Countdown RIP King of carrot in a box.
So sad to hear he has passed on. Genuinely one of the funniest comics ever, always the funniest on 8 out of 10. Wherever he is i bet he has them pissing themselves laughing. RIP
I was devastated to hear about Sean Lock's death this morning; he was a one-of-a-kind, brilliant comedian and he will be missed. RIP Sean.
I don't want to believe it. He had my sense of humor and his laugh always had me in tears. The way his brain worked and how he just hooked you, leading you along before punching you in the gut with funny . . . He was up there with Robin Williams as one of the funniest comedians in my mind.  Hope they're up there giving one hell of a show right now.  Rest in Peace, and may peace come to his wife and children.
Still can't believe hes gone
The beam rules joke is so simple yet so clever it gets me every single time, a master of his craft RIP legend
Legend
Rest in peace...
I’m gutted 😢 he was just brilliant
What a legend, he will live on in generations to come through he's comedy
15 storeys awesome  Sean will be sadly missed 😢
A perfect video to say goodbye to Sean. R.I.P sir.
From the Netherlands: rest in peace Sean.
RIP 🕊
So gutting. Going to miss him so much, I have depression and whenever I was really down I’d put a Sean Lock compilation on, always cheered me up. He didn’t know it but he was like a little anti depressant for me. Rest in peace comedy king. ☺️💔
Rip.
Always used to watch 8 out of 10 cats when I was stressed with school work, Sean brought many laughs and I'll continue to quote some of his stuff for a long time ❤️
R.I.P to one of my favourite comedians of all time. Thanks for making me laugh over the years.
RIP a great comedian
Brew your own soy sauce kit 👏👏👏
There is no word enough to describe this man! I'm gonna re-watch now  every episode i find on here R. I. P.
Anything he did with Miles Jupp was always hilarious too!
Truly sad news to learn this morning, however, seeing the thousands of people share how Sean brightened their day was beautiful to see. It's clear that Sean not only had a clear influence on a lot of his collegues, but had a special place in a lot of the british public's heart too. Rest in peace, Sean Lock, you will be missed.
Anyone remember Tim Conway?  Well, Tim is boring in comparison to Sean.
As an American, I enjoy British comedy. And Mr Sean Locke was one of my favorite. What a loss for comedy. Rest In Peace
What a talent. RIP
Sad loss quick witted  and funny be missed great comedian rip sean 🙏
He will be missed. RIP
"That's a challenging wank"
Fuuuuuuck cancer.
So sad to hear this - a funny, funny man... RIP
Such a sad day. My love and respect going out to his family and friends.seemed such a lovely guy on TV
Rest in peace genius. Can’t believe we even have to say rest in peace to him already, so heartbreaking. Sorry to his family. 💔
Panel shows won't be the same anymore
RIP sean lock
The black and white still at the end got me. :'(
This is not such a great day, lads. I'll tip one for Sean tonight, he will be remembered well.
Legend!
Sean's death was the first death of a celebrity, a stranger, that affects me emotionally. No tears, but I feel pain from him being weirdly funny. And I don't even live anywhere near UK. Only know the guy from uploaded videos on Youtube of British panel shows.  Thank you, Sean. Rest in Peace.
Have been watching sean on TV for as long as I can remember and his sense of humour has always been legendary. Crying my eyes out at this news. 9/10 cats and British comedy in general won't be the same without him.
I will never ever be able to look at a carrot again without giving a tear for sean❤
💔
He will be missed l've saved this in my YouTube folder to watch later a very sad day RIP Sean
Too soon, Sean! Rest In Peace!
I actually cried when I heard. Heartbroken. Mind you, I cried a lot watching him too. Will be so missed. A funny funny and kind man.
Sean you’ve left us far to early…. RIP 😢
Class act ...Nazi Island is still a classic piece ...and carrot in the box ... A sad day 😞
RIP Sean Lock. The only person able to make Jimmy Carr show his true laugh.
What a legend. R.I.P Sean.
Heart breaking news about Sean Locke. I loved him on the "8 at of 10 cats does countdown", and more. He did  always make me smile and laugh despite the time, or how shit of a day it had been. Sending love to his friends and family. May u rest in Peace Sean Lock
One of the few people that could make Jimmy completely lose it.  He will be missed.
RIP Sean. You made me laugh hard, and often. But I'm sad today.
You'll be dearly missed Sean! Thanks for the laughs.
They cut out some of the best bits of his proudest achievement gag - I can see why, but the full thing honestly had me gasping for breath I was laughing so hard the first time I heard it. Something about his innocent delivery combined with how dark his humour could be that really nailed it.  Man I'm going to miss seeing him on TV. He was one of the funniest people on it.   I know you said you don't care about your obituary as you'd be dead, but RIP Sean, and thanks for the laughs.
Rib achingly funny! will be missed
Not ready for this 😭
Legend RIP
Haven't laughed so hard in a while. RIP to this legend
what a shame, a proper comedian, always made me laugh, rip sean you will be missed
Rest in peace Sean
So shocked and saddened by this. What a great guy gone too soon. Tired of the good ones leaving. Thanks for the laughs. 💜
I wish the news of his passing was just some sort of twisted sean lock  joke (as he did from time to time)  But it's not, he really is gone 😢 rip Sean.
The very very best. Rest in peace Sean Lock.
Legend
Comedy Genius 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Good riddance, you grumpy bastard.  You'll be missed, Sean!
Horrible to read this news today.  Addicted to this show thru YouTube in the States. Big Jimmy Carr fan, and appreciate all the panelists. Brits, my condolences.
A comedic genius. RIP and with laughter Sean Lock. x
Very sad to hear about Sean's passing, he was a quality comedian who always made me laugh, RIP.
As an American, I watch enough YouTube to be familiar with some British comics, but sadly, I don't know him. However, in just this clip, I can see why he'll be missed. That dry but gentle delivery made everything he said funny. There was an element of completely undeserved positivity that made his randomness delightful.
What a funny man, a clever man... a legend ... so sad greatly missed.
RIP Sean, you showed me absurdism can be stoic. Dead stoic.
He'll be badly missed. Thanks for all the laffs Sean!
Really sad by his death he is such a funny man 💔
I am an American and we do not get much UK "telly" programing but I discovered him through Youtube. I think I've searched and watched every clip of him on the platform 10 times each. He always made me laugh with his quick wit and no fear attitude to comedy. The carrot in the box gig was one of the best skits with unbelievable acting and comedy timing. priceless.. My condolences to his family and friends.. Know his work has touched people around the world in a positive way..
Sean will be missed but the laughter won't stop, R.I.P
So sad.
Devastating news
Such sad news I'm really going to miss him he was such a brilliant comedian.
An amazingly funny man. Gone too soon.
RIP to one of the funniest people to ever grace this show and the world with their presences
A legend was lost today. Never to be forgotten. Thank you for all the laughs and the unbelievable examples of your uninterruptable selflessness... I was the horse you slowed down for. You will be missed dearly, by all of us, but your legacy will live on. R.I.P. Sean
5 minutes 53 seconds long. 😐
Thank You Sean XD <3
Thank you Sean, you are a legend
I loved him and his humour. I will miss him.
Sean will be missed. One of the most creative and original comedian's ever.
What a loss :( :( :( :( rip you legend
Fantastic comic, brought a smile with his wit and humour, god bless,
Absolute legend, didn’t even need to try be funny he just was. RIP
RIP Sean, thank you for bringing us so many smiles with your unique wit and talent!
There has only ever been one celebrity death that hit me as hard as this news today. That was the death of Chester Bennington (Linkin Park vocalist) back in 2017. Sadness doesn't even begin to cover my emotions upon hearing the news of Sean's passing.
This is painful to watch…..what a huge loss to the comedy world. Sean you made us laugh..you’ll be sorely missed
I've been watching him for 20-odd years. It's going to be shit without him around.
R.I.P Sean..Thoughts with your family.
I truly don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone make Jimmy laugh genuinely except for Sean. I’m an American, living in Denver. I’ve seen every bit of Media Sean ever put out. His incredible wit and razor sharp sharp intuition will be so missed. I’ve never found a more intelligent, quick, creative comedian or even person. Grateful for his time, thoughts are with his family.
R.I.P Sean.  You constantly and continously will bring me to tears!!
Can’t believe it Best comedian on the circuit Sadly missed
Very sad news will be missed RIP my friend 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🍻
A genuine great guy with an incredible gift of cheering those around him and us watching him on our screens!
Going to miss his sick sense of humour ..  Rest in piece Sean
RIP legendary Sean Lock😔
Thankyou for all the laughs Sean, you will be missed
Such a shame, only 58 and such a funny guy, I love him on 8 out of 10 Cats
I don’t have words to explain how saddened I am.  My sincerest condolences to his family and friends.
I love that they’ve made this tribute and rightly so!! RIP Sean lock ❤️ thank you for the laughter!!
Now we will never know what happens on Nazi Island :-(
A Real Legend! Just an icon
Thanks for the laughs, Sean. Safe travels
r.i.p sean lock one of my top 3 comedians the man had me laughing tears multiple times couldnt believe it when i heard the news you will be missed greatly but you live on through you comedy and will be remembered. LEGEND.
Will be properly missed.  What a legend. Thank you. ✌
RIP 🙏  WHAT A TALENT YOU WERE.
SAD TO LOSE ANOTHER GREAT FUNNY BRITISH TALENT.
Thank you Sean, RIP
Thanks for the laughs Sean RIP
R.I.P. Sean Lock. An incredible Comedian, with a wicked sense of humour!
RIP to a great comedian.
This video is how i found out. I am sad now.
Not every comedian has such a gift to keep the flow of full throttled laughter; some get chuckles and giggles mixed in with laughter, but Sean received full laughter at all times; which he gifted to us all. He's earned a place with the greats up there, though he'll be missed down here for always. Thank you, Sean Lock, and rest well.
Sad day. Great man
Legend
Thank you Sean for all the side splitting laughs. Thank you Channel4 for allowing his recent best to be broadcast.
Not gonna lie took me a while to get used to him, I don't like deadpan deliveries but he laughed a lot on this show and got to know him better, cats does countdown will be weird without his and Jon's rivalry 💔
This is the man who emotionally pulled me through the covid lockdowns. It feels like I've lost a dear friend. R.I.P. Sean. Thank you for everything.
RIP Sean :(
"Challenging wank".  Thanks for the laughs Sean.
R. I.P 😥
A great of comedy and one of the last few who would say anything and everything to get a laugh, he had a endless supply of waffle to say and it’s hilarious every single time RIP to a legend
I am truly gutted, Sean really was one of a kind. One of the best comedians out there, he is going to be so sorely missed.  My thoughts are with his family, RIP Sean 💔
Genuinely gutted by the news. He made  the show better by far. Such a brilliant comedian and always gave me the best laughs. I’ll miss seeing him on the show and on other things. So sad for his fellow comedic family and his own family. Truly a great person and so effortless in his use of humour. I’ll miss the dynamic he had on the show with the others. He’ll be missed sorely and I’ll always remember him for being one of the best comedic figures of his generation. We’ve lost a star and more sadder than that we’ve lost a part of ourselves that was filled us with joy for so many years. Rest in piece Sean Lock and your genius will live on long in our hearts.
Not in a disrespectful way but weirdly his passing has really upset me. Truly loved watching him and his dark humour. He will be very sadly missed by many :(
Absolutely gutted, his delivery of his jokes are perfect and funny as fuck.
Flattened by the news. Usually celebrity deaths don't phase me. I usually read the headline, think "that's unfortunate" and move on. But Sean was a breed of his own. The finest comedian of a generation, and by far my favourite person, period. This perpetually joyless world grew a little less joyful today. Rest in peace you glorious lunatic.
RIP
Really sad stuff hearing of his death.....its people like Sean that keep us laughing and struggling too breath when at times the world is in turmoil,,RIP
Don’t think anyone has made me cry with laughter as much as Sean, jaw-achingly funny.  RIP you hero of comedy.
Magic
A great comic, will be sadly missed RIP Sean
Absolute legend
RIP 🖤
That tapeworm and pork bit and song, just ad libing. Or in big fat quiz, saying kids suck at acting, brilliant.
No carrot in the box?  "If there's not a carrot in this box, you're a genius". - Jon Richardson
One of the best...rest in peace Sean.
He made me laugh so many times, he will be missed R.I.P
I got to know him only during Lockdown Youtube browsing here in South Africa. Spontaneous and sharp. I am sure his fellow comedians are in shock! Thanks to a fearless original.🤝
This has come as a complete shock to me and all fellow fans of the show in Australia. He brought true joy to all who watched across all age groups (God Bless).
Thank you for the memories Sean. We will all miss you x
😢😢 so sad... This guy has had me n tears, pure comic gold , Sean you will be sadly missed, the world has truly lost a great soul 😔
I've already been dealing with my Brother dying this month, now Sean follows. One of the Joy's of my adult life has been Sean Lock and 8 out of 10 cats. It will not be the same.
What an absolute comedy legend. RIP sean lock
Funny funny man RIP
Just glad that we live in a world where his content can be seen again and again. A brilliant man and comedian. Thoughts with his family.
Can't believe it. One of the best comedian's in the world, let alone the UK. Rest in peace Sean.
RIP Sean. Such a naturally funny guy. I’ll never forget carrot in a box and seal clubbing. This man made me genuinely belly laugh. Gutted to hear of his passing. Absolute legend
Who can't love Sean Lock? RIP
There isn't many comedians that literally have me in tears with laughter... RIP Sean Lock...... I'll be going to the fly tipping of him 😂
it was only 3 days ago i was watching back old clips of Seans stand up and i woke up to the awful news today RIP Sean thanks for the laughs
I feel lucky to have grown up watching such a great comedian. So saddened to hear the news today 💔
Such condolences,, a rare comedian who made me laugh out loud. But his family and friends foremost, and children the most. Xxxx
What a guy, it's not gonna be the same without him :/
Devastated when I heard the news earlier today. Thank you for all the laughs over the years, Sean, and for helping me through some difficult times. You will be sorely missed. I'm going to drink a can of "water" in your honour.
such an amazing comedian who never failed to bring so much laughter. ♥
This one hit hard. Rest in peace Sean lock 😪😪😪
Rip funny man... You were brilliant and will never be forgotten....  My thoughts with your family and friends....
I must confess that I never really watched Mr Lock, but after having watched only half of this, it's clear to me just how naturally funny this man was. Very sad. Condolences to his family and friends.
WTF? RIP Sean. Damn. Fuckin...damn.
Simply a legend who will be greatly missed.
Rest in peace, sad.
True comedic genius executed flawlessly every time even in the mistakes, he will be missed immensely by me and my mother who both enjoyed his stand-up and panel shower appearances a great deal and all those who bore witness to his comedy. RIP - Sean Lock
Such a funny, funny man.  Rest peacefully young man, and thank you for all the belly laughs you gave to us all.  Gonna miss you.  Huge hugs to your family and friends X
I cried when I heard.
I hate this. Everything about this. Not the video, the video is hilarious. I hate that it needs to exist. I hate this.
God damn, he really was an irreplaceable talent
"Noooooo! Whyyy! Noooooooooo! Aaaaaah... You can't write tears Jimmy."
“If I could have my ashes spread anywhere I wanted, I’d have them spread in Piers Morgan’s eyes” I think we as a community of fans should have that request honoured. We’ll miss you Sean 🖤
I'm devastated... my favorite comedian.... a great creative mind .   my condolences to his family and his friends .
A very funny man, will be missed.
RIP Sean x
So sad to hear of his passing. Sleep well Sean. You made so many laugh.
he is a sensation. absolute legend. RIP
Made me laugh when I was at my lowest, I owe him a lot. Rip Sean
Forever the carrot in a box champion. RIP
The tears of laughter and joy will be something I'll never be able to thank this comedic genius for. God bless. Rest easy, sean.
Legend
Thanks for all the laughs, Sean. Heaven just got a bit funnier. RIP.
💔 so sad that he’s gone, he was absolutely brilliant
All the energy of a rat, trapped in a can.
I got hooked on to Sean a couple of years back. Had just moved to a new country for grad school. He got me through when I was at my lowest. A guaranteed mood uplifter. Thank you, Sean. For spreading light and levity and for always reminding me that eating a thousand whelks is never a good idea. The fact that I'll never see a new Sean Lock 8/10 Cats video just breaks my heart.
Damn.  I thought he had recovered -- as much as you can recover from cancer -- from whatever it was that caused his throat problems and his unwell look a couple years back.  You were good, Sean.  Not just at being chaotic evil.
I'm glad his remembered video is this, its exactly how he would have wanted it ❤
Honestly shocked when I saw this news today lost a true comedy genius
what a legend
What a way to find out...
Thanks Sean for all the crying laughing memories what a craic so clever fast and original a one off never forgotten, Irish Mick
RIP Sean Lock. That guy was a legend. Had so many laughs. Respects to the family from the Netherlands.
Legend. RIP 😔
I've only recently gotten into British Panel Shows, but I've come to rather like Sean and his style of comedy. Genuinely saddened by this news. R.I.P Sean.
If i ever felt down which i have on many occasions i just watch Sean on YouTube and it never failed to make me laugh. If god hosts a panel show then you will surely be sat beside him.
So very sad that you're gone...way, way too soon. I'm absolutely shattered. Loved seeing you & Miles Jupp together. Rest peacefully you wonderful person 💗
I can't source it, but his bit where he kills a budgie with a spoon is still my favourite comic routine of all time. RIP
I hope Rachel kept that Christmas card, what a way to remember a truly funny man, bless you Sean
Really sad with this news, he made me laugh lots
Absolutely heartbroken, RIP Sean 🙏
One of the few people who genuinely made me cry with laughter an absolute genius.
He will be missed! 😢 Thank you for all the laughs, Sean!
R.I.P TO AN ABSOLUTE LEGEND   WILL BE MISSED BUT NEVER FORGOTTEN
Legend rip 💙
Rest in peace Sean we'll miss you mate
Sean Lock was a light in the dark, a song in the heart. He made me smile when I thought I couldn't, made me laugh when I thought I wouldn't. RIP, sir. You'll be dearly missed.
They better but Noooooooo, whyyyyyyy, noooooo, ahhhhhh on his obituary
R.I.P  I cant quite remember the words you wanted us to say after you die but I know you wanted people to say : Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The first time I discovered Sean lock  was in the comedy show  if I remember was called 15 stories high which no when ever mention Sean lock at he's driest and funniest and he's hilarious Chinese flat mate hope they repeat it soon you won't be disappointed does anyone else remember the show RIP Sean Lock
We'll miss you Sean. RIP.
A few very hilarious sean lock quotes “I hear voices. But I ignore them and just carry on killing.” “I’m not sure what my biggest fear is. It’s either me saying yes to Strictly… or them saying no.” Jimmy Carr: “Do you think British people judge others on their accent?”Sean Lock: “I judge people long before they’ve opened their mouths.” RIP Sean Lock
This man would have myself and my Dad in tears, thank you for those memories. Rest in peace Sean Lock ❤️
You cant be serious.
So heartbreakingly sad.
He won’t be reanimating any of the Nazi’s for Nazi Island anymore :(
Rip Sean, you were the best and forever undisputed champion of carrot in a box
His rectum of the year joke was one of the best. RIP ❤
NNNNOOOOOO i didnt know until now!!!!!!
Absolutely heartbreaking, an incredible man ❤️
So sad, one of my favourite comedians. Thank you for sharing these.
England has lost a legend today. Rip Sean, thanks for evey laugh.
Rip Sean king of the cats 😢
His Live at the Apollo routine about his wife buying him some bees is my absolute favourite. Heartbreaking news. Far too young to go 🖤.
lovely lovely bloke who just so happened to be one of the funniest men in the world too :(
Thank you Sean ❤️
The amount of days I've spent binging clips of Sean lock and the shows he's on it just feels unreal that he's gone ill miss him dearly
Hope you bring as much joy to everyone up there like you have here 👍
“I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex tonight”  I’m going to carry that quote with me for the rest of my life
I'm shocked by your passing...  R.I.P. Sean....
Comedic genius ,so very sad to hear of his passing , thanks for the laughs x
Basically watch these on repeat such a funny man. The sprinkler story is just wow. So sad.
I can't believe the news, R.I.P. Sean.  Thoughts and prayers for his family and friends  🙏 . Oh how he made people laugh, crazy man, he will be missed by many.
💙 Forever Sean
I must admit that I cried when I read the news about Sean passing. British comedians are very popular in Norway and Sean Lock was definently one of my (and Norways) favorites. My thoughts and condolences goes to his three children and his spouse, his close family and friends.
I will always remember Sean for that time he resurrected all the top nazis.
“I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex tonight”. 😂 RIP Sean.
RIP Sean.
Very very funny man, comic genius and a huge loss to the world of comedy. RIP
Unparalleled creativity in his humour. You never knew what wild shit he was gonna say. Absolutely my main reason for watching so many episodes, and other shows like this, as well as all the stand-up of his that I could find. We've lost a damn good one today.
Sean is in a very select band of comedians to make me cry with laughter, just funny to the core.
Absolutely loved Sean, comedy genius, condolences to his family and friends and you will be sadly missed Sean.  Thanks for continually making us laugh mate ❤️
Couldn't belive it when I was told that he died this morning. Rest in peace buddy your generally one of a kind and funny as hell.
Sean made me laugh so many times, thank you for that edge of comedy you showed us and blah blah blah I can't do you justice! Comical genius R.I.P. condolences to the family, you will be missed.
The first stand up DVD I ever bought was Sean Lock. Back in 2008 I think it came out. And I always ended up with this hilarious song stuck in my head. My stomach hurt so much from watching it on repeat. "When Johnny grows up he’ll be a soilder, When Jimmy grows up he’ll be a sailer, When Timmy grows up he’ll be a tailor, And all the girls will be wives! Washing up and cooking dinner, Washing up and cooking dinner, Washing up and cooking dinner, Wives, Wives Wives!!!" 😂😂😂
RIP legend!
Soooo sad. Will be deeply missed, but never forgotten. Cats won't ever be the same again.
Rest easy Sean.  A diamond of a man.
A really funny guy such a sad day , even although I never met him you could tell he was a real decent human being.
Something in my eye..  going to be sorely missed.. not many you will feel like this over x
Absolutely gutted, such a comedy legend. RIP
For those wondering, he died this morning from cancer
Pouring out a can of Blue Rat on the curb in Sean’s memory.
Heart broken
Rest in peace Sean.. I'll miss you. One of the greatest comedians ever..
RIP SEAN YOU WERE A VERY FUNNY BLOKE
When the "RIP Sean Lock" flashed I cried. What an amazing comedian. He got me through so many sad moments in life. I'm happy that platforms like this exist so that more and more people can enjoy the comedy Sean Lock brings. Thank you for everything Sean.
Such sad news. Rest in peace and thank you for all the laughs. My absolute favourite. 💔
Shocked and saddened to hear of Sean's passing. I had no idea he was even unwell in any way so to hear today that he's passed away was an absolute shock. I always enjoyed Sean's unique brand of humour ,as did, many many others.  Rip Sean, you will be greatly missed.
Probably 8 out of 10 cat's does countdown will never be the same! RIP.
What a wonderful comedian he was....Thanks for the laughs.
I promise I won't spit on you wasn't there 😆.  gutted for all who had the pleasure of knowing him in person 8 out of 10 cats won't be the same without his cheeky face
R.I.P and a fuck you to the 28 dislikes
Sad times, a very very funny man. RIP
Rest in peace. A sad loss of a great comedian
Wait! I live in the States did we lose Sean? What happened? “Rectum of the year” You are one funny Bastard
What a genuine talent Sean was. So so funny.
The bit about the train, where he gave up the seat and the woman told him angrily “I am NOT pregnant”.  So Sean said “well, if you lost a couple of pounds, you never know what may happen”.  And then Sean admitted that he never said that and he fucked off to another carriage
Rip Shaun  thanks for the laughter
Bloody hate to make this a bit of a debbie downer, but after my breakdown I spent 4 years indoors with agoraphobia. Can’t even begin to tell you how many reruns of 8 out of 10 cats got me through some very sh!tty dark nights on my own. I think someone in the comments below put it perfectly regarding Sean; he was never the most mind blowing, rib cracking comedian you’d come across, but put him in a team like this & he just blossomed. His one liners, cheeky sarcasm & the way he had everyone in hysterics with his random silliness will never, ever be forgotten - genuinely hilarious, lovely, humble guy, who I’m sure helped not only myself, but thousands of others through many a dark hour. Cheers Sean for the laughs, you’ll never ever be forgotten - especially by my generation. I’m sorry you lost your battle, but you won our hearts. Rest in peace & safe journey xx
The best R.I.P Sean
Such a sad loss. Literally could make a joke out of a glass of water.
Thank you Sean lock for always making me laugh. Pure genius !
When he bent over it set the sprinklers off! Legend!
Legend. Thanks for all the laughter over the years.
"milk milk lemonade..." - thanks for all of the belly laughs Sean!

My favourite comedian Along with his mate Harry Hill And Milton Jones 3 naturally funny Kings of Comedy Will be remembered dearly .
Thank you for putting him on you tube. As an American I would have never found out about this hilariously insane man. Rip
Funniest comedian ever 😥
I’m so gutted, i just found out and can’t get my head around this. God bless you Sean.
When he did his bit on Big fat quiz years ago about the child actors i cried laughing. And 15 Storeys high his  dark comedy was brilliant. Will miss seeing him on TV as i loved his humour.
“Nobody wanks me off” - Sean Lock.  Thanks for the laughs Sean, rest well sir!
Much Love Sean I miss you already man🕴
first i saw the news on facebook, at that moment , i was so hoping for it to be fake news, but after google, and the light outside going a little dimmer, i knew it was real and cried a little.
One of the few comedians to leave me gasping for breath through laughing. Rest in peace.
Noooooo..... Whyyyyyyy.... Nooooo..... Aaahhhhhh!!!!
So so sad a absolute Comedy Genius...My type of humour 🙄
A brilliant comedian. Genuinely saddened to hear of his passing. Rest in peace Sean.
Legend
Someone that can't be replaced or replicated. RIP sean
Such a tragedy; thanks for the laughs Sean and RIP.
Love him x RIP
Honestly this video of five minutes is an injustice to the man, his tribute video and best moments could easily be about 15-20 mins long
An absolutely brilliant comedian… so sad that he’s gone too soon 😢
Just found out he died, R.I.P buddy.
WTF that’s just made me almost throw up I didn’t even know he had died until the end 😢   He’s easily one of the best comedians I’ve ever seen RIP Sean Lock 🕊
R.I.P
Poor Miles sitting at home, never to be spat on by Sean again.
What an absolute gem, I wish I could have met Sean Lock. Gone far too soon. National treasure.
Absolute class act
2:35  Nice to see James Corden showing complete respect to everyone else in the room by keeping off his phone during a recording.  What a douchebag
I couldn't normally give a toss when "celebrities' pass away but I am genuinely gutted this time.
A shame they missed his best bit  on the show here -- when Rachel dawned the helmet and the viking beard -- "that's a challenging wank...."
RIP one of the best
True comedic legend, he will be greatly missed. He made that show, he made it worth watching aswell as all the highlight clips on Youtube😪 RIP Sean❤
Who would dislike this clip… like really!
I’m absolutely gutted and saddened by the news an absolute comedy genius. I really hope his last words were “ you can’t bribe pigeons 😂 “ you will be sorely missed. RIP 😢😢😢
pure comic genius  the school play comments put me on the floor
Sean was one of my biggest inspirations for comedy... I loved him, rest in peace sean
Normally celebrity deaths don’t get to me but this time it really hurt :(
Mr Lock,thank you for your world of wit. how do i accept this very,very sad news. I watch you. god bless.
Beamrules is one of my fondest memories of Sean. Along with Carrot in a Box.
RIP Sean 😢. Thanks for the laughs, and thanks for just being who you were.
He will be missed, that made me cry.
RIP, I’ll never forget the carrot in the box!
I sure as shit hope there's a place up there, rest in peace Sean Lock. Honest to god one of the funniest comedians to ever grace a panel show, never gave a shit, stuck true to his sense of humour. Legend.
Sad news... And no chance for a third "carrot in a box".
Channel 4 could of done more than a 5 minute ish video tribute
R.i.p sean locke
If they have rectum of the year in heaven, I cerainly hope he will get his revenge on Maradona.
Utter shock, heartbroken ~ thanks for the laughs mate ❤️ 🙏
Sean Lock Rectum of the year :) , R.I.P you hilarious sod.
Channel 4 need to commission ‘Nazi Island’ as a fitting remembrance.
To watch the best bits of Sean Lock would take 58 Years... legend, so many great moments... RIP and thanks 👏👏👏
Another nonce silenced just when we need a distraction. RIP
I didn't know he died until I read the comments. This is genuinely tragic.  I'm in shock.  One of the greatest. My condolences to his family and friends.
A true legend rest in peace
Genuinely one of my favourite comedians. Rip sir.
cant believe hes gone
Sleep well you incredibly funny man xx
RIP Sean.
Gone but not Fearne Cotton. RIP Sean Lock
RIP Sean.
i will always remember the day the flying ants come out
I'm shocked. Thanks for all the food times you gave us Sean. Rest in peace...
A huge loss to the comedic world. Truly obscure & stood alone. Especially on Nazi Island.
Legend.
Wow what a bummer. He brought me many laughs
Such a funny man
im really going miss sean
Absolutely gutted. RIP Sean Lock, one of the funniest men to have ever lived.
That’s a challenging wank comment will go down in history ! Thank you Sean and rest in peace 💙
My thoughts go out to Miles Jupp.
Not funny....R.I.P.
Thank you Sean for making me laugh time and time again.  Fly high mate, it just got a hell of alot more funny up there  🙏
Very sad, but knowing Sean he'd want to be remembered like this.   What a legend.
Requiescet in pace
A special man and a sad loss.
My favorite Sean line (paraphrased): "I won't spit on you when we're having sex tonight."
Are you serious? Wow. Blown away.
What a diamond geezer. RIP
RIP Sean🖤🖤
RIP 🙏
Bloke was class! You should have left in the part where he said about 1 of his biggest achievements was when he went seal clubbing
The man was a comical genius and  the king of dad humour. so many laughs over the years watching him. Big love Sean ❤ you leave a huge hole in comedy and personally.  p.s you are the best❤
RIP ❤️
His particular brand of genius will sorely be missed.
Whenever I saw Sean on TV, he would make me howl with laughter. I am so sorry that he has gone, the world needs people like him, especially at the moment. RIP
The undefeated undisputed carrot in a box champion 🤜🏼
Rip Sean lock 😞
Loved the dry humour always funny  RIP
Eau de Sean, that must be what's gotten in my eye.. RIP to one of the best ever. Man is a legend, and somewhere a horse is shedding a few tears 😔
Love,respect and prayers from nz. RIP brother 🙏
May you bless the heavens Sean 🙏
My condolences to his family and friends. I am from Guatemala in Central America, a country most likely he didnt even cared haha but he made me laugh a lot in this past years and i am thankful i was lucky to find his comedy. RIP
One of the funniest people on tv and such a lovely person
Frickin annoyed and caught off guard this morning when I heard about his passing.  Some of the comedians that do the quiz show circuit are lucky pretenders.   Not Sean Lock. Fucking sucks this.
This sad world is even sadder with your passing but I'm glad I was around to appreciate your comic genius. Thank you Sean. Cheers 🍻
RIP.
What?? you have to be kidding me. i recently found british comedy and sean became my favourite.
Shocked to hear this morning. We've lost a true gem in the comedy world. The man's dry humor and delivery never fail to make me laugh. Regards from Indiana.
Sean Lock: Sensation, Idea, comedian
Thanks for the years of laughter
One of the only people to make Jimmy Carr truly laugh. Rest in peace, you have done your service.
I'll always think of you when I'm eating pork. RIP Sean.
I'm beyond shocked. Sean Lock was absolutely my favourite comedian, this is a hammerblow. May he rest in piece.
I'm genuinely genuinely very sad and disappointed over Sean's departure. He was an outstandingly talented comedian and Cats etc will not be the same without him. He seemed like an absolutely affable chap too as so many lovely goodbyes are pouring in. You are and will be missed by so many for so long Sean, and Thank You so very much for what you gave us whilst you were with us 👍🏻😓❤
Hearing the news of Sean’s passing with such great sadness. My most favourite comedian and the most funniest guy.   RIP Sean. I think I will need to watch all my favourite 8 out of 10 cats does countdown to help me cheer up. Sean is the best.
Discovered Sean only a year ago Condolences from South Africa...... For his colleagues and fans
I was shocked to hear that Sean had passed away...a favourite moment of mine is when he said he wouldn't spit on Miles Jupp 😅.....RIP.
Still can’t believe it, even now watching this! 😔
Legend!
Rest easy Sean, thanks for all the laughs, rarely failed to put a smile on my face.
no words to describe how amazing this man is, i cant count the amount times i cried with laughter watching him, he'll be missed so much
He's been my favourite comedian since I first saw him. Condolences to his friends and family and everyone who's life hes made better. RIP funny man.
“Now that’s a challenging wank!”  😂 Gets me every time.
He will go down as a comedy legend will be greatly missed RIP SEAN
RIP Sean.
Laughs for my adult life. Thanks Sean, RIP.
A legend of comedy RIP
Sean lock a national treasure
It's so sad how you don't truly appreciate someone until they're gone. I can't express the countless hours of enjoyment that Sean Lock brought me and I didn't honestly realise myself until he was gone. All of our everyday comforts and joys are ephemeral and all of our worlds are a little colder for his passing. You will never be forgotten.
It still hasn’t sunk in that he’s gone. His death has really upset me but I can’t start to imagine the pain his close family and friends are going through.. my thoughts are with them ✊🏼
Gutted. What a legend. Sympathies to his family.
Not many celebrity deaths really affect me, but I’m genuinely gutted Sean is gone 😭  Cheers for all the laughs!
Hey Channel 4, this was awesome. Thank you! May he rest in peace. Could you do us all a favour and do a Sean Lock 1 hour supercut?
nothing ever really bothers me....but for some reason sean locks death has really hit me...king of carrot in a box ..
RIP Sean Lock! I still laugh so hard at stuff I’ve watched on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown numerous times…when Sean promises not to spit on Miles when they’re having s*x later gets me every time!! What a legend and taken too soon.
One of a kind.  R.I.P Mr. Lock 🍻🍻
How could I have forgotten about ‘rectum of the year’...he was an absolute one off.
❤️❤️❤️❤️  RIP Sean. You were the best comedian ever.
Sad news indeed.
RIP Sean, really wasn't expecting this. You will be missed :( A light has gone out in the world today.
Having HD footage of people who have passed away is so surreal. I look at footage of Amy Winehouse and to think she's dead and gone is so bizarre. To lose Sean is very strange. He's a part of comedic relief, comfort television, and now he's gone. Like Caroline Aherne, the same feeling of loss. To many people, these shows may be nonsensical, but Sean was a real talent, and the laughs, and yes, the comfort he gave millions alone on a Friday night won't be forgotten.
❤️❤️❤️
Thank you Sean for all the laughs you have provided us all when life around us gets too bloody boring and normal. Beautifully unique and truly one of the rare gods of comedy.
The wit on that man. Will miss him, he gave us all so much.
Sean made life better ....a gifted funny wittty man ...sad he is gone .....god help jesus n the pearly gates ..cause de devil dont want him .....rip sean ...
Rest In Peace, Rectum of the Year
Wow! What a talent he was! Such a shock to hear of his passing. Sean's humor was unique, dry and delivered flawlessly. Can't recall laughing any harder than when watching Sean perform. He will be sorely missed. My condolences to his family and friends. RIP, Sean, thank you for quality humor.
RIP Sean..
RIP dude loved your comedy, cannot believe the news!!!!
Sean helped me through a really crap part of my life, I think we can all say we will miss him dearly!   Thank you for all the laughs you gave us all big man!
Love you Sean!
I am officially sad. Sean Lock never failed to cheer me up.
Missed him offering not to spit on Miles Jupp
Carrot in a box is still one of the greatest pieces of tv ever
who tf is diskliking this?
sean lock dead in the words of the great man himself  i*m still processing it such a sad sad loss
Rip to a great man and great comedian, thanks for the laughs shaun.
RIP to a legend. A man who made us all laugh. Something very special about that. You will be missed Sean by all of us.
Nobody will ever be able to challenge his title of Carrot in the Box King.
What a loss.  What a legend. Thanks for the laughs and the memories Sean. You will be fondly remembered and sorely missed. Thank God for YouTube.  You will live forever...
One of the very best. We will miss you Sean x
Rip Mr Lock thank you for the laughs
Always remember Sean for the smell of hot tarmac and a vets flannel. RIP Sean lock
Pure gold
How sad . Unique talent
This one hit me hard. Have really enjoyed reading the comments section, it's so uncharacteristically wholesome. Sean would be very disappointed!
thanks for all !
Sean's Bond theme: 'Bond on a bike; Bond on a boat; Bond with his hand's round a villian's throat: SKYFALL'. Genius. R.I.P. Sean
“Coming home to a full mousetrap”. Class.  Pure class.
💔
Whoever disliked this video I hope you have a really really bad rest of the year
Heart sank when I read the news. One of the funniest men to grace the earth ❤️
R I p locky  Genius  Enough said.😢🤣
It really is all in the delivery. Such a terrible shame :(
Absolute legend. Naturally funny. The best clip is that last one how Claudia couldn't contain herself. Shows how funny he was ❤
Brilliant. R.I.P Sean Lock. You'll be missed.
Thank you for the laughs ................................
"NOOOOOOOOOO! AAAHHHHHHHHH! WWWHHHHYYYYYYY!"
i still can`t believe it when i saw the news today....speechless
Was watching the one where he makes the big cocktail last night. Very funny bloke. Cannot believe he has gone.
Thanks for the laughs. You will be dearly missed. RIP
Never forget when he described sex as a "comfy piss" hahahaha!   Rest in peace.
A comedians comedian. I cannot believe he’s gone. It’s so so sad. What was always very apparent to me was how much he was respected and idolised by other comedians who took part in Cats/Countdown and QI. I will hugely miss his wit and charm. RIP Sean.
What a man. Could always rely on Sean to make you wet yourself laughing <3
"I won't spit on you when we're having sex tonight."  Going to miss his humour. R.I.P
Gonna really miss the man who taught me what it meant to really laugh. Rest In Peace Sean in the knowledge that you have touched many lives with your comedy. ❤
For quite a moment I felt like I lost a close friend :(
What a legend, didn't give a fuck! Rest in peace.
R.I.P man. To say that he'll be missed would be a massive understatement and a massive disservice to the years of laughs he provided.
The Best
wtf,  I was just thinking "oh nice a sean lock video" and then the sad surprise at the end :(
RIP to a comedic great 😔
No "challenging wank"?
A massive shame!!!!
RIP Sean, such a funny man..💔💔
So many examples of Comedy gold. Carrot in a Box, Seal Clubbing, Rectum of the year (Claudia's reaction, priceless) so many.
RIP Shaun, made me laugh too many times. 🙏🏾
That's a challenging w*nk!  I'm off to win rectum of the year and eat 100 whelks, RIP Sean Lock you utterly mad b*****d.  And yes, you cannot write tears.........
Many laughs from our house watching Sean. Sympathies to your family and friends. Rest in Peace Sean - we never die we just move on x

Terrible loss for comedy. Rest in peace, Sean.

Heartbroken. He's made me laugh endlessly over the years! Rest in peace Sean, you will forever live on!
RIP Legend
Absolute Legend 😇

Heaven just became a hilarious place to be, rip Sean
Can't believe one man has completely defined my sense of humour. Thanks for everything! RIP Sean
LEGENDARY HUMAN
Sometimes when I get really sad, I go back and watch the clip of Sean explaining Nazi island and it never fails to make me laugh.
This should be a 6 hour video. RIP Sean there is nobody like you
So sad...
This was such a shock to read about this morn. So sad.😫
Never heard of, I guess he ain't that popular outside the UK. Rip though.
To Sean lock
Thanks for the laughs ❤️ English humour at its best
A man who will be missed by millions
Devastating news..R.I.P Sean lock, one of the greatest...😪
This breaks my heart. I found all of these shows during the quarantine in the US last year and have thoroughly enjoyed his sense of humor. My one dream was to get a chance to visit the UK, run into Sean, sit in a tree and spit at pigeons. RIP Sean.
What a loss. 58 is too young.
No, I can't believe this!!!
Genius  Rest in peace
Videos of Sean Lock and his humor in 8 out of 10 cats and it's countdown variant kept me going through pandemic. Absolute legend. Gone too soon. RIP Sean.
Beyond gutted Thanks for all the laughter Sean Rest in Peace
A favourite comedian. RIP
Rest in Peace Sean, i loved everything about you and modeled my sense of humor around you. Im beyond sad that ill never be able to thank you face to face. All my love and condolences to you family and friends.
Fuck cancer! Sean’s memory will be immortal.
This man made me laugh so much - never forget his Madonna impression on stage. A very sad day. RIP Sean.
Simply the best
I still can believe he’s gone 😭 he was my favourite, loved his stand up aswell. RIP Sean you hilarious legend ❤️
15 Storey High watch party at my place tonight
A sad moment not only for the U.K but for the world I'm an American and I'll miss his brand of humor he was truly a genius

15 story s high . The best and most original sitcom ever . RIP Sean 😢
Rest in peace legend!
Carrot in a box Rectum of the year  Nazi Island  Whelks  Challenging Wank  Joes Poem  Thank you for the endless laughs Sean Lock ❤️
Very funny man. He was brilliant on 2 out of 10 cats and his skits with Roisin Conarty had me howling with laughter.
Very sad will miss him
I only know him from the bits posted on YouTube but I'll miss him. Great comedian and he seems to have been a good person too. Such a pity fir his family. And Jon.
such a great talent and will be sorely missed, brightened up a messed up world 👏 R I P Sean
RIP sean you're one of the best comics out there
This is the most heartbreaking news I could receive. Almost daily, since the pandemic started, I watched 8OO10C. Can’t believe this… RIP legend
😥
<3
goodbye you funny fukka x love ya x miss ya x thank ya x
I hope his family respect his wishes to be fly tipped
One of the funniest of all time, few people made me laugh as hard and true, RIP Mr. Lock. Thank you for being there when I needed some relief.
brilliant comedian
Will forever miss you Sean😢one of my favourites
The World has lost a good man too soon,he was so funny.
RIP Sean! It is amazing to think that people are able to hide this kind of illness so well and you are totally oblivious to it.
He is tremendously funny... so sad to hear of his passing so young
I loved him - he will live on!
R.I.P Legend
A wonderfully funny man, thankyou for the laughs  R.I.P.
RIP. Gone but will never be forgotten. Thank you for the laughs you've given us. Thanks to YouTube we can all still bask in your comic genius  forever.
Nobody even comes close to how naturally funny sean was, absolutely world class we have lost a great man today
Brought my family to laughter over and over again. Rest in Peace Sean.
I just clicked it after seeing Sean Lock on the thumbnail, laughed throughout the video and then realised at the end what had happened. I am eternally grateful for the joy he has brought me and many others during a very hard year. Sean will live forever in our hearts.
I "discovered" 8 Out of 10 Cats two days ago, and have been binging it since. Two days ago was the 16. of August, the day Sean died. I haven't laughed in a long time the way I did watching Sean, and now I find out he has passed... Damn...
Sean Lock is a comedy legend, for as long as ive been watching 8 out of 10 cats does countdown, hes always been one of the best, its so surreal and ive been genuinely sad about it all afternoon. R.i.P to you sean
What a man. Insanely funny, easily recognisable, literally a comedic genius. He was so quick witted - not many comedians will ever have the wit he had. Always thought he was the funniest on 8 out of 10. Just a great man.   Rest in peace and thanks for all the laughs ❤️
Can't believe it. One of the best and brightest. Comedy and Britain have certainly lost a true legend. RIP.
Legend is an overused term but Sean Lock was definitely a leg end. RIP Sean 😔
This really sucks, I genuinely think Sean was one of the more underrated comedians I've seen, while simultaneously being one of the funniest. I've rewatched these clips thousands of times over the years and I still laugh even though I know the punchline. A true legend. RIP Sean😔
You’ll be missed! Love and best wishes to his family! The guy was a legend!
i can fallen asleep and watched all of his works, you will be missed, he was right, he was a sensation, an idea,  A FRAGRENCE
AHHHHHHH NOOOOOOO AHHHHHHHHH WHYYYYYYYY RIP, thanks for the laughs
Earth has lost a very funny man but Heaven has gained a very funny man. R.I.P Sean Lock.
what kind of cancer did sean have?
The 22 people who disliked this deserve to have Sean's ashes sprayed in their eyes. And pierce Morgan also.
Oh god, I can't stop laughing
I feel like crying right now, but he can still make me laugh in the time of his death as well RIP Legend
❤
Absolutely gutted. Rest easy
What a sad day been watching him for years he always had me in stitches. Thanks for all the laughs Sean.
It so sad one of the funniest men Never to be forgotten!!!
legend, he warmed up so many homes... may his family find peace
Thanks for the laughs Sean, you’ll not be forgotten
What a lovely tribute by Channel 4, Sean will be missed by everyone that knew him. RIP.
Quite unlike any other comic, 😥 ❤
Purple van man got me through many a lunch break at a crappy job I had back then. You'll be missed Sean.
This hit me about the same as when Robin Williams died. A person I never met and don’t know personally, but just the headline alone this morning floored me. The grief feels more intense than I would have expected. I cannot fathom how deep the grief and pain are for his family and friends.   Thanks for the side-splitting laughs over the years, Sean. I really feel like he gave us something we could never repay.
Rest in peace, Locky boy. You’ve brought so much happiness with your brilliant grumpy wit and excellent deadpan delivery. You’ve made me laugh till I cry. You’ll be miss by us all. 🖤 Till next time.
there arent the words to explain just how much joy this man brought into my and many other peoples lives RIP Sean
"Rectum of the year" was Sean at his best. RIP 🙏.
Too soon…
Let's all wank in his honor to rachel with a beard. R.I.P. Legend.
Thanks for all the laughs Sean. You will be sorely missed. RIP
RIP to one of the finest comedians of his time.
What a legend, gone but never forgotten Sean RIP
I am so shocked. I didn't even know he was ill. Me and the wife always watch 8 out of 10 cats. Thanks Sean for all the laughs, rest in piece sir.
Rest in peace
Thanks for all laughs mate! You’ll be missed!
Well this made me sad, just cause this is the first I heard of him dying.
Rip Sean.
Gone too soom
This guys a absolute legend hes one of the very few comedians that actually make me laugh. Hes by far my favourite comedian he will be missed R.I.P Sean lock
One of the very few that make me cry with laughter .. rip Sean 🙏
RIP 😇
absolutely hilarious British comedy at its best
A very funny man! Smart, whity and someone who always managed to put a smile on my face when ever I chanced upon him.. A loss to British comedy and to us all in the UK. Safe journey brother, you will be missed!
RIP Sean lock 💙
I'm so glad to have stumbled across this show on YT.  American's don't have access to these shows and don't have shows anywhere similar to 8OO10CDC.  Some of my hardest, headache-inducing laughs were when Sean was on.  Sean could riff off any guest and it was so much fun to watch.  I'm glad to have come across you Sean.  Thank you for the continued laughs because I'll be watching your 'Funniest Moments' videos on YT for a long, long time.  Thank you.  I'll definitely miss your wit.
Hugely funny man, who has brought smiles and laughter to so many people. RIP Sean, thoughts and prayers to his family and loved ones. Sadly missed....😔😥
Rest In Peace 🙏🙏🙏
RIP Thanks mate
I can't believe he's gone. May he rest in peace
Such a funny man, very talented.  Gone way too early...
I got through the lockdown because of him. I used to fall asleep smiling to his videos. I can’t believe it. Rest in peace, Sean. We’re all grateful for you.
Comic genius. We have been lucky!
I'm soo sad this truly funny man is gone I have been watching him on YouTube all afternoon such a legend
How you managed to edit down to 6 minutes of his work is beyond me.  This could have been hours long.  RIP Sean.
Legend ❤️
R.I.P I was ready to get my teeth into a 40 minute watch here. :(
Rip Sean sad loss for the comedy scene x
Rip Sean lock. Always would watch you when I felt sad or stressed and it was an instant escapism.
I was shocked when I saw that on the Guardian today.  RIP Sean.
One of the greatest. Rip Sean. ❤️
Sad. Funny, funny man - will be missed.
RIP legend
Truly one of the greats. Made me laugh when I was at my lowest. 😢
Every single day I watched him, every clip I know word-for-word. I can't grasp this, it is absolutely heartwrenching
No!! What happened? Can someone let me know
Awh this were so sad to hear, I love Sean Lock I used to watch 8 out of 10 cats (and countdown) for years and Sean was an amazing comedian that gave me more laughs than I can remember! RIP <3
This guy was funny as hell. I wish he was more famous here in the states
A very funny man. The world needs people like Sean Lock. Sorry to see him leave us so soon.
Thank you Sean, for continuously making me piss myself every time you were on screen. Comedy genius RIP
RIP Sir...
Rip legend
Now I'll always be wondering which box the carrot is in. Rip Sean.
What a man
I just can't believe he's gone, what a loss
Had so many laughs when I watched 8 out of 10 cats. Rip Sean...
I love that the rectum of the year sketch was pride of place near the end. Unpolished and true to life. That's Sean Lock
I have spent most nights watching episodes I could find on YouTube after discovering this last year. Sean seemed like a great man and he will be missed. Thanks for the many laughs! ❤️
Sean, you will be dearly missed.
He may have lost to Maradonna but at least he beat Fearne Cotton.
HE IS IN HELLL FOREVER#
can’t believe he’s gone 😢
Sometimes when you're feeling like shit, you have to put some comedy on. Sean was so funny and made the country laugh week after week. Thank you Sean.
I absolutely loved Sean and was really hoping to see him on Taskmaster. He was a legend
Did not expect it at all. Heartbreaking 💔
My favourite quote from Sean. “Google can go fuck itself”
RIP, thank you for all the laughs
That man has always got a carrot in his box
The world just got a little less funny. He will be missed
RIP Sean. You were a very funny man.
If I had to be bummed to death by a comedian, I'd choose Sean. I wouldn't get any pleasure from the bumming itself, nor would Sean, but I'd be be giggling as I imagine him recounting the event in a future stand up routine. Now I'll end up with a lesser comedian, probably Acaster or Widdicombe, it'll hurt less but I won't be laughing.
We have lost a true great of comedy, as this video shows. So sad....
RIP Sean Lock a genius ❤
ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? I literally just this week started getting into him and his best bits on 8 out of 10 cats. Jesus, this sucks so hard. Rip Sean
This news shook me today. So shocking. Rest in peace Sean. Comedy legend.
this video should be 5hrs not 5mins
One funny man rest in peace ❤
i loved John Richardson when he said something about Sean being carrot in a box champion , classic Sean that was.
As tribute we should all criticize a children's stage play and then compliment Katy perry's rack.
RIP SEAN FUCKING LOCK
RIP Sean, you were bloody funny mate 👍🏻
Gutted .I thought he was a really funny ,witty guy .. He will be missed ..
i didnt know he was dead . . he couldnt stop being funny or running away with himself
only 6 mins but probably as much laughter as the human body can stand in one sitting.  God bless Sean and his family
Rest in exhilarating peace! ❤️😢
The Word Best Word To Describe You Mr Sean Lock BRILLIANT God Bless
I'm off to get pissed and nick a plough.  OI!
Gonna miss him! Thanks for all the wonderful laughs.
Rip
He was absolutely one of the funniest comedians I have watched. Delighted to have been able to enjoy his comedy
Rip Will be missed on TV.
My favourite comedian and made me laugh out loud on so many occasions, was lucky enough to see him live! Will be sadly missed and I was genuinely emotional when I read he passed away, RIP Locky ❤ x
❤️
Thanks for the laughs Sean. Rest in peace ❤️
The guy was absolutely brilliant. Genuinely shocked and saddened about his death.
Nooooooooooooooooooo! 😭😢😭😢
Damn, I was so entertained I actually forgot why I watched this video by the time I got to the end.
In the world of humor, Sean was always a true original with a kind heart (and a helluva dark side). Rest in peace, mate.
Jimmy Carr; "Sean, is there anything you'd wish you could do better?"  Sean; "Ah, I wished I could be a less considerate lover"  That joke was phenomenal, like many others RIP
RIP Sean Lock.  The undisputed, undefeated carrot in a box champion.
Saddest news I could receive. Great comedian and seemed like a genuine nice guy. Thoughts and prayers towards his family.
Thanks for the laughs Sean,  you will be missed 😢
I'm not from the UK so I only just found out about it when I saw this video. So I'm really thankful you uploaded this tribute. It's incredibly sad and I wish all the best to his family and friends and for them to get through this sad time. He was a really great comedian and I will miss laughing my ass off to his comedy on YouTube. 😭 Sending love from Germany ❤️
Whelks deserve to be in this montage, but regardless it's going to be a void nobody else can fill. Thank you for the laughs Sean, your existence brightened the world.
Honestly whenever I had a shit day I would watch any of clips from his shows or stand-ups and it would make me laugh honestly he is beyond amazing he is so special in every way rip sean it won't be the same again
I hope he’s happy , He such be very happy , LOVE U SEAN
I was gutted when I heard this. The man is/was a legend ! He`ll be sorely missed RIP Sean 😢
He has made me laugh for hours on end, not a lot of people if any besides Sean did this. So sad to see such a bringer of laughs leave this world.
I got to know about Sean through the 8 out of 10 cats videos here on YouTube. I live in the middle of Russia and we don’t usually get to see British comedians over here, but even on the edge of Siberia there are people who will remember Sean Lock with a smile
Sean was one of the best naturally funny comedians this country has ever had. He was a master of his own unique style of comedy without being trashy or offensive. He will be a massive loss to the world of comedy and I hope he will not be forgotten as I don't believe he ever got the recognition he deserved. My love and sincere condolences to his family...RIP Sean🥰🥰🥰
In tears of laughter and sadness here. Thoughts and condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. "Nooooooooooo, Whyyyyyyyy, Nooooooooo, Aaaaaaahhhhh! You can't write tears."
So many laughs this man caused, he will be dearly missed
As soon as I hear his name called on the show I start to smile, absolute gutted 😢 to hear of this sad news…  Rip Sean.. thoughts and prayers to his family and friends
Nicely done Channel 4! God bless him.
What a legend never forget his mr bojangles joke I scare my kids with it..super funny gonna miss him tbf 🙏
a true legend  <3
I am genuinely sad. I'm gonna miss him. Who is gonna protect us from all the BS now? Those kids are still awful at acting.
I'm wordless. I'll miss him so much. Even laughing at his best moments feels so strange right now.
Legend.
RIP Sean. Thanks for all the funny memories 😭
Somebody up there is up for a treat! Thanks for all the laughs 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
What a legend! Great sense of humour and way of looking at the world. I'd love to have seen him live.
Who disliked this smh
RIP Sean 😔
I strangely want to send my sincerest condolences to Miles Jupp.
Bit of a shock. Too young. RIP.
damn this news hurts rip sean
He will be sadly missed, love the guy
Legend x
Being massively selfish I was gutted the legend had died because I wouldn't get to laugh at any new material. Sean Lock was a truly unique and gut achingly funny man. Can't imagine the massive gulf he'll have left in the lives that those who knew him.
it's really snotful to cry and laugh at the same time! rest in peace Sean, many thoughts with his family and friends ♡
Legendary 🥃
I'm so sad now
He had brought so much laughter in my life in grim moments, I read about his demise while watching cats does countdown compilations, and I can't still believe it.
This man had made me laugh so many times throughout the ears... rest in peace
R.I.P Sean thanks for the laughter.
Rip 😢
I was absolutely shocked when I read it. Great comedian with a ridiculous niche, amazing jokes and demeanour, awful loss.
And now I’m crying. One of the greatest comedians I’ve ever known. He is, already, extremely missed.
:(
wow Channel 4.. is 5.53 all you got for one of the greatest english comedians? Hes a legend. He deserves much more. Peace Mister Lock.
I had no idea he had cancer , I don’t think he told anyone apart from his close friends , I loved him on countdown. What a legend , so heartbreaking , I’m sure he had more humour left in him ❤️❤️
Absolute comedy legend. He was one of the only comedians that made me gasp for air from laughing. Feels weird writing about him in the past tense. RIP Sean Lock - funniest man & best rectum 💔
RIP Sean!
Shocked by this. 😪
So sad from this
Literally whenever I felt down I spent the whole day watching Sean Lock’s stand up or these 8 out of 10 Cats clips, honestly devastated but so thankful for the comedy I got to watch and get to rewatch cause of him
Rip sir ,you was one funny guy
Funny funny guy will definitely be missed
Legend
I could not believe it when I read that this morning and I was singing his "if you want to get a tape worm ear some pork" may this legend rest in peace
So tragic , so wrong 😞
Such sad news of his passing. He made me laugh so many times and he will be missed.  RIP Sean.
As an American I didn’t really know of him for long but I can say with all confidence that every moment I’ve seen of this legend was pure genius! I’ve watched hours of this show and every single time this man had me in tears! It truly is a sad loss and a sad day knowing a legend has left us. RIP Mr. Sean Lock you will be greatly missed!
Jesus, I just read it here. Makes me very sad to hear that.  Hope he left with a grin if you know what I mean.
Legends never die!  Rest in peace Sean
absolutely gutted when i heard the news , 1 of my favourite comedians  , just seemed like a great guy , i shed a tear driving on the north circular this afternoon .  R.I.P. Sean Lock
Absolute legend was top drawer in 8 of of 10 cats and the countdown version, no other comedian that appeared on both shows even came close, RIP Sean Lock
This hurts so much.
RIP Sean 😭
How can you dislike this video! Rest easy Sean ❤️
Beautiful!
Couldn’t believe this when I heard it. Thank you Sean for all the laughs❤️
I was lucky enough to see Sean live a couple of years ago after growing up watching him on the TV screen. A wonderful, surreal, insanely original personality. He is the master. RIP
One of the very best at on screen and live. Thanks for the chuckles! RIP
He’s missed already, and that feeling will only grow exponentially. RIP Sean.
comedy legend. can't believe he's gone. all though he's not with us now, i know he'll still be making us laugh for many years to come. RIP Sean Lock
Thanks for the laughs, now you can rest and have a laugh yourself.
My nephew has a hamster called Claude thanks to Sean he will be getting a second life as a bookies pen  RIP Sean Lock 💔
Cheers Sean💙
Absolutely gutted!
Hope you make the angels cry with tears of joy.  And Satan is jealous of you being in heaven
Seal clubbing - “it was like a trolley dash” 😂😂😂. RIP Sean
R.I.P To a  unique and very talented comedian.
I thought he was ace really good comedian he reminded me of one of your mates down the pub who u have beer and a good laugh with miss u shaun rip
I lost my dad to cancer at a similar age to his kids, hope they're doing okay. RIP Sean
I just can't imagine anyone filling his seat as Captain... He was so genuine and a purely natural humour, endlessly so.  I know they have a confrontational dynamic on the show, but fuck... I dread to think how Jon Richardson is going to feel during the next few recordings of whatever panel show he ends up filming after this. I don't think it would matter which show, just looking over at another Desk in any Studio would make me damned depressed.  I really can't think of anyone who is as natural and relatable as Sean Lock...  Based on his earthy wisdom and everyman style, I suppose I would want Mickey Flannigan. Based on his whimsy and commitment to absurdity, I guess only Eddie Izzard would do. Based on his exaggeration of misery, obviously Jack Dee is his closest Brother. Based on his dry and parodic treatment of dark or twisted or disgusting topics, I think Miles Jupp was a stalwart ally in a world of politically sensitive people.  The truth however, is that none of these people could ever supply me with everything that Sean Lock did, on this show, in his stand-up (Lockepedia makes me laugh out loud, uproariously, at least once per viewing, and I have viewed it around 80 times), or as a Guest on Big Fat Quiz... That year he and James Cordon were teamed together, I honestly almost pissed myself, genuine straining was needed to keep my bladder closed.  I honestly love you, Sean Lock. You did us all proud.
I’m an American that was lucky enough to find Sean Lock a couple years ago, and have enjoyed his comedy since.  I genuinely appreciate what he provided to those of us lucky enough to witness his greatness.
Rest in peace legend.
Sean you really were and always will be Britain’s funniest comedian, you gave me so many years of laughter and joy and I’m heartbroken you’ve left us! 8oo10c will never be the same without you! True British treasure
Sean Lock is the reason I discovered 8 out of 10 cats does countdown 3 years ago. Thank you Sean 🙏
Such a brilliant mind.
A fucking legend has been lost.
I like to believe we still have Sean, and that his coffin contains nothing more than a carrot.
RIP to a true legend
When I first heard Sean had passed, this morning, I said "NOOOOOOOOOOO!" so there's your obit, mate, just as you wanted. I'll miss him, he made me laugh so much.
The bit with him and Miles Jupp about Hitler is one of the funniest things I've ever heard. RIP Sean.  Miles: "He was whispering to me about Hitler." Jimmy: "Why was he whispering to you about Hitler?" Miles: "He said I don't know about you, Miles, I'm on the fence." Sean: "I'm a bit like the Swiss during the second World War. I can see the good side and the bad side."
I still remember his show TV Heaven, Telly Hell and I rewatched it all the time as a kid. Brilliant show. He'll be sorely missed.
A British comedy icon…this hit me much harder than I expected
fam i was eating up those countdown highlights during lockdown, this hit hard 😔 r.i.p. you beautiful man
An absolute legend taken too soon! Rest in peace Sean you will be missed dearly and remembered for your class sense of humour!!
Heart breaking a true comedian that will be missed by so many...forever laughing, forever smiling, always remembered 💙
Just absolutely shocked and saddened by this news. He was hilarious and seemed a lovely man. A great loss to Joe public but his poor family  😔
Seans personality got me through serious depression with his sense of humour and never ending laughter. R.I.P Sean. Deepest condolences to the Lock family.
A very high percentage of the things I've watched on Youtube have this man in them...Anyone who hasn't seen it, please seek out his tragically overlooked sitcom 15 Storeys High. The man was a genius, and felt like your mate.
'Carrot in a box' is up there with 'Dead Parrot' and 'Fork handles.'   - RIP....
A great comedian and an amazing man!
Very sad , RIP Sean.
His comedy brought me so much comfort, and belly-ache laughter for years. Such a unique comedian, and a kind human being. Heartbroken but forever grateful...
I am deeply sad by this news
Rip one of the  Greatest
Rip to both the finalists of world rectum of the year.
I miss him already. I've spent more than a few afternoons searching and watching yt for Sean Lock.  I had hoped that he'd tour America, (again, I think.) and that I could see him live.
He just made me cry again...what a funny bloke - RIP Sean
Can’t believe it… he was one of the funniest people I had ever heard and was the only reason why I watched 8 out of 10 cats does countdown. Rest in peace Sean Lock
this was quite a way to learn that Sean passed away. RIP to a real one.
❤️❤️❤️
You can't write tears, Jimmy.
Absolutely gutted, he was THE funniest comedian ever
RIP
💔
A legend among comedians.. rest easy ❤
RIP Sean Lock, one of the greatest comedians in my opinion, he will be missed, my thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family :(
I'm gonna miss him, man... R.I.P.
Sean Lock would find that grey image you have at the end of him absolutely hilarious and would rip it to shreds but thanks for this video, what a legend!
Damn, Rest In Peace Sean and thanks for all the laughs!!
What a legend. Carrot in the box is still one the best things I've ever seen. RIP.
"Sean's like a kitten. A big, angry, drunk kitten." Rest in Peace x
R. I. P 😢
Just, one of our funniest!  Will be missed.
Deeply saddening. He was everyones quirky uncle. No holds barred sense of humour.
🙏🏽🙏🏽😢😢
OMG! I'm devastated!!! I watched 8 out of ten cats and the 8oo10 cats does countdown from the US on YouTube. I LOVED SEAN. He was the funniest person on that show! Rest well, Mr. Lock! ❤
Salute.
He made me really like British comedy and made 8 out of 10 cats one of my favorite shows to watch, Thank You for the endless laughters Sean. Rest in Paradise 🙏🏼
Shall this great man rest in peace
loved him, then hated him(not really), then loved him again....you couldn't help it.....will be missed
RIP Sean, thank you for all the laughs.  You will be missed by more people than you could ever imagine.
RIP The Mayor of Fun. I shall raise a flagon of mead to you tonight
Thanks for all the laughs, Sean! Smile in peace!
RIP you absolute legend 🙏
I imagine there are thousands of people watching clips of his tonight. What an amazingly funny man RIP buddy
Haven’t cried this much over a comedian since Robin Williams. He will truly be missed. Love you Sean, Rest In Peace buddy!

Absolutely gutted !!!! Brilliant comedian terrible loss. Thoughts with his family
He was one of my favorites on 8 out of 10. He will be missed. Much love from the States.
RIP Sean. Legend.
top man....nuff said...
Fucking devastating. RIP, Sean.
😔
I’ve been going back though all the Channel 4 best bits of countdown over the last few weeks, Sean properly makes me lol like very few other comedians. Wish I could have had a pint and a laugh with him, rest in peace fella, thanks for the laughs ❤️
This hurts. I could’ve never imagined this would hurt this much. He was such a brilliant man. To think that we’ll never see him on television again, makes me cry. Rest In Peace, Sean.
Oh no, not Sean. Take Jimmy leave Sean.
WHAT?!?!?!
World champion carrot in the box has left us all today. Sean you sir was class much love to the lock  family.
A great comedian and gentleman. His jokes were kind and not demeaning to various groups in society. Other comedians can learn a lot from him. I will miss him muchly.
The world is a little less special today. I’m genuinely heart broken. This man has cheered me up and made laugh even through depression and the worst days I’ve had. A true genius and one of the funniest people ever. 😭
I cannot believe itv news 6.30pm put Nandos running out of chicken before seans death, pathetic.
Rip Sean
Today will be a truly challenging wank. RIP!
This honestly, this kicks like a mule. I had no idea he was sick, such a legend!  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam
RIP Sean, you will be missed.
R.I.P. Sean. His brand of surreal humour always drawed you in, wanting to hear more.
The "Frankie Boyle" of Cats.!!
A great comedian. So sorry to hear of his passing. 💔
The best way to remember him, remembering him for his comedy and all he joy he brought to us viewers and the people he worked with
Absolute legend! Will be missed but very well remembered
"You don't save any money from quitting smoking because you'll just end up living longer" - Sean Lock. This is the joke that came to my mind when I heard of his death from cancer.
We need to remain 8 out of 10 cats does countdown.  We lost one of the funniest cats.
Oh dear... this is such shocking news. Rest in peace.
Oh damn, I had fun until the last few seconds, didnt knew :(
No words can describe my appreciation for this man who made me cry with laughter till my sides hurt and made my day that much brighter through some of the toughest times in my life... Rest easy sean. 🥺❤️
RIP Sean countdown will never be the same and no one could fill your shoes I for one will always play Carrot in a Box.
Sean Lock - why so young while Jedward still live?
Rest in peace.  Heaven will be laughing a little louder and we'll be a little sadder.
Reginald D Hunter has got to be the most boring comedian out there….even Sean’s funny quips can’t break him into a smile.
RIP legend
RIP Sean Lock, he was one of my favourite comedians :(
Oh no! I thought the title was facetious at first. The world will miss such a brilliant comedic mind.
Goddamn this man has brought me so many laughs, he will be missed.
Horrible loss. Thoughts to his family and friends.
So sad... He was a hilarious man! The world is a little darker without him..
A true legend! U will be missed! RIP Sean
What? He died? Damn shame
RIP Sean, thanks for the laughs😢🕊
RIP. A huge loss.
Can't believe the news. You will be missed Sean
The main reason I watched 8 out of 10 cats does countdown  RIP Sean Lock.
Sean usually left me in tears because of his jokes, not this time sadly. RIP Sean
Feel like i've lost a friend, despite never meeting him. RIP Sean. You are a comedy legend.
This guy was the only person who made me laugh when I was going through tough times. What an amazing individual
Thank you for all the laughs Sean, you have brought happiness to millions of people. Rest easy 🙏🏼
My favourite sean moment was when he was describing what mornings are like in his house; 'put the lightbulbs back in' 🤣🤣 RIP Sean, legend
wait... wtf!
rip, love the random sense of humour, the best
Let your memory live on, Sean
R.i.P
I don’t believe this is true
I couldn't believe he passed away. Never saw it coming. Fuck cancer, man. Fuck.
Can't believe it. Rip Sean, thanks for all the laughs. The worlds lost another legend.
So very sad to hear of his passing, my thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
The funniest person I've ever seen. He brought a lot of joy to a lot of people. RIP.
The undefeated carrot in a box champion! Loved Sean. Truly missed
Awe man I'm gutted...Sean always had that twinkle in his eyes and you knew something brilliant was coming or something surreal...yeah gutted today to hear this..RIP Sean
So much laughter from this man. RIP
"I don't have thousands of little lights on the outside of my house at Christmas. Because I don't think it's quite annoying enough. I just have one massive bulb the size of a football that only goes off once every 15 minutes that's as bright as the sun."  This was one of my favourite Sean Lock bits from 8 out of 10 Cats. Apologise if it's not verbatim as it was a long time ago I saw the episode.
Actually shocked and saddened by this
It will take a lot of time to get to Sean Lock's level of comedy.
RIP Sean
I’m absolutely devastated
I will truly miss him.
He was my spirit animal.
I always thought he was sick i never knew he was ill, Thanks sean for years of laughs. You played the grumpy old man to perfection. You wiil be miserable sorry i meant missed. X
What a loss RIP Sean you made me cry with laughter so many times. Thoughts and prayers for your family.
This can't be true. :( Made every crowd breathless of laughter, sorely missed. RIP </3
Absolutely devastated to hear the news loved him :(
Rectum of the year 👊
Absolutely gutted. I cannot believe it. Love to family ❤️ RIP you legend
That first scene is the best way to describe him
Damn I'm so sad to hear he passed! I will always love Sean and his comedy he will be sorely missed, my favorite Sean lock line was "that's a challenging wank"
Damn, Gutted!!!
Heartbreaking 🙏
Of all his accolades i think being undefeated Carrot in a Box champion was his most prized.
Used to absolutely love 8 out of 10 cats on friday nights when it first came on our screens, sean had me in absolute stitches 😂, would just like to take this opportunity to thank him for all the laughter and smiles he brought to my life, my heart goes out to is poor family at this horrendous time, may he r.i.p and will never be forgotten sean!
Such a good laugh the guy was. We miss you Sean.
Gone too soon, thank you for the wits.
RIP Sean and thank you
What an incredible loss. He has given so much joy and laughter to so many and made me laugh even on the darkest days. He will truly be missed.
This was a nice fitting video to put out Channel 4. A man who often had many us often in stitches of laughter! Missed greatly & a tremendously funny man!
RIP Sean, you’re genuinely the only comedian to truly belly laugh. Absurdist humour, so witty, I can’t believe he’s gone. Sleep well mate xxx
RIP Sean, comedic genius.
One of a kind comedian!
Brought alot of laughter and good memories to me and my family through the years, rest in peace 🙏🙏
Carrot in a box.... no need to say more. He will be missed
I'm still struggling to comprehend the news. Sean will forever be my favourite comedian, constantly bringing me laughs when I needed them. A national treasure to be sure.
Legend. What a sad day it is knowing hes no longer with us. Rip sir, and thankyou. 😔
❤️
Next to jimmy he was my fav
The Tiger who came for a pint should now be published in his honour!
if u disliked this sym ur mum wipes her arse with weetabix boxes
Legend.
Absolutely heartbroken to hear the news this morning. Sean has made me belly laugh and question the functioning of my pelvic floor muscles on MANY an occasion. Such a dry sense of humour that I absolutely love. My heart goes out to your family and friends, but you will be missed by a nation xxxxxxx
Re invented the dry comedy style and took it to another level R. I. P Sean and condolences to his family and friends
Haven't watched TV in years, but always  watched compilations and clips of Sean here on YT.  His humour reminds me of me and my dads humour  (who is called Sean also lol)  What a legend. Rest Easy Sean! You will surely be missed.
He will be missed 🙏🏻
Never failed to make people laugh. He was such a clever man and will be missed by so many. ‘You can’t write tears’ - he was so right.
R.I.P
Not many deaths shock me, but Seans definitely hit me
This man to me had the most witty cold humour of any Comedian I have ever seen, Rest in peace Shawn your a true loss to this world 😢 P.S you made me cry with laughter 😂😂😂
THIS IS HOW I FOUND OUT. NO. NO NO NO NO NO. Dx I'M SO HURT.
RIP Sean
jon's never gunna get that carrot now is he
Such a large scale, immediate and heartfelt response to this crushing news has restored some of my faith in humanity. Thanks Sean, and i mean that.
Thanks for the laughs, Sean. Raise some hell while you're up in heaven ;)
Oh no, hell be missed. I loved his brand of un PC comedy. Caio good man.
Can't believe he's gone. Best comedian in my opinion
One of the best! So sad 😢 my thoughts are with his family and friends :( x
Ive never met him, never even been in the same country as him, still feel like i lost someone close, this hit way too hard…but we should not cry as thats not what he would want…rest in peace sean
Rip fella
The best      RIP
Thank you for making me laugh over the years. RIP Sean
An Absolute Legend. You will be missed Sean. I had the pleasure of seeing many of your gigs, and will miss you on 8 Out of 10 Cats/8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown amongst many other shows.
"That's a challenging wank" remains my all-time favourite one-line comeback.
'That's a challenging wank' - Sean Lock. His 15 Storeys High is on a par with The Office. Cheered me up no end during the last couple of years. FaF.
I’ve seen Sean live. Such a great comedian!
R.I.P you true legend. Will miss your comedy :(
Celebrity deaths don't always hit me that hard, but this felt like losing someone I knew.  I can't believe we'll never see him again. We're so unlucky to have lost him.
Thankyou Sean… you truly were Original and absolutely superb, I’m absolutely gutted and wish your family all the best and would like them to know my thoughts are with them…  RIP Sean Lock 💔 legend.
Rest In Peace, Sean. Thanks for the laughs.
I already miss the lad
He is 8 out of 10 cats. I'm not sure it's worth trying to replace him, you simply can't
He's up there with robin Williams with how much happiness and laughter he gave the world through his off the charts wit
I loved this guy ill miss his whit
Gone far too early. So funny
Such a shame, to be taken at 58yrs by cancer is so tragic. I hope his family can take solace from knowing that Sean,over the years gave so many people, laughs galore and he will be missed by his many  many fans and colleagues.  RIP Sean
I’m grateful to have laughed at and with him!
He's the main reason I started watching 8 of 10 Cats =(
RIP Shaun, and thank you for your comedy over the years.
so hard to think he's gone
I just got into 8oo10c. Now Sean’s dead. WTF. RIP you funny funny man!!
RIP to the Goat 🐐 one of the Funniest blokes I’ve ever seen
i cant bring myself to watch this yet my thoughts go out to his family and friends
Absolutely fucking gutted guy had me in fits of laughter  Rip man
Loved him .. so funny.. RIP he will be missed
Thank You Sean for being that guy and showing us  what Real Comedy is !!! Rest in Peace Sean Lock .
As a Dutch viewer I always enjoyed Sean watching 8 out of 10 cats and other shows.  He was brilliant!  Had enough times wiping the tears out of my eyes from laughing 🥲  Thanks Sean for making the world a brighter place   Wish his family a lot of strenght🌹
I’m American, and had the privilege of finding British comedy game shows when I was around 14. And while Sean was never my inherent favorite, I naturally recognized him as the glue that kept almost everything he was in together. I will miss you dearly Sean, Cats Does Countdown, and the world, will never be the same.
Well I really wasn’t expecting Sean’s death.
So sad. R.I.P. Sean, you're brilliance will live on forever.
Stage legend seen him many times ahead of his time in a sense. Top bloke .
There's been countless days and nights fill with laughter thanks to Sean. It's so sad to see such a wonderful person leave us. Rest in peace Sean!
What a LEGEND of a man. RIP Sean. I'm gutted about this.
My sides are splitting and I must have seen those clips a hundred times…..rip Shaun, and thanks so much for all the unstoppable laughter …..your are amazing.
I’m going to miss that mans humour, always had me in tears of laughter, I welled up watching that, legend
Now THIS is a challenging wank 😢 RIP
“I won’t spit on you when we’re having sex tonight” god i will miss this man so much
I hope his tombstone says “ nooooooooooo ahhhhhhhhhh nooooooooooo ahhhhhhhh ouch” what a legend RIP
Heartbreaking…the only celebrity whose death actually hit me.
Rest easy Sean thank you for the laughs thoughts and praise with his family
One of my favourite all time comedians, gone far too soon. RIP Sean x
An absolute legend. His humor got me through some difficult times. The true comedian is one that makes comedians laugh, he made them cry with laughter. You are indeed missed.  Love from Morocco
Devastated 😭❤️
Although this is such a sad loss, I couldn't help but smile at this. Sean brought us so many fun memories through his work, making us smile and laugh at his jokes and quick wit. You will be missed Sean. We all love you.
i starting watching 8 out of 10 cats when youtube was a thing. i was 13, and moved away from home and was painfully homesick. i would religiously watch the show - sean, jimmy and jon made me remember home and what being british meant; our humour. our wit. our love of laughter. i have never been so devastated by the death of any celebrity before... RIP sean. thank you for making the most difficult years of my life still radiant with your comedic genius.
0:44 that’s the “challenging wank” episode.
Hit me really hard this one has. He was an absolute legend
This is a good tribute
I miss him aready
A complete and utter genius. One of a kind. British comedy legend. RIP.
Rest in peace Sean, you were a wonderful man who spread laughter everywhere. You will be missed.
I remember lying in bed with COVID last year watching endless you tube clips of Countdown and thinking what an absolute genius this guy was - brilliant brilliant comedian - will be sadly missed
Sorely missed!!!
RIP will be missed he was so funny
Not my ideal way to find out about Sean’s passing but then again, who ever wants to find out that such a brilliant comedian has passed in the first place? RIP
A five minute tribute with "RIP Sean" then plug in all your links fucking disgusting channel 4
Rest in piece from overseas, tragic loss.
I couldn't believe it when I heard the news on the radio.. genuinely felt really sad and shocked. I didn't even know he was ill. Amazing mind, amazing comic. :( gutted.
Thanks for all the laughs mate - absolute legend.
Really am gonna miss seeing this man’s passion for just being the funniest bloody man in the room
Sean got me through a tough period of time with his comedy. I will miss you yah cunny funt.
Shame on those disliking this
15 Storeys Watch it
Rest in peace, you will be deeply missed❤️
Rest in peace legend
Actualy can’t believe this! One of the best comedians 😩 made 8 out of ten cats countdown! Such a legend rip
He'll be dearly missed. Absolute legend
Sean was my absolutely favourite comedian for so many years and he will always remain my favourite. Whenever I was feeling bad or down, only he could cheer me up in such a short time. I loved 15 Storeys and never understood why it wasn’t more widely known and loved. I have watched and re-watched his material endlessly. Hours on end. Always keep his shows offline everywhere to be able to break into tears of laughter. Today that’s just tears of sadness. So gifted, so imaginative. Irreplaceable. What he did on a panel show was beyond what any other comedian could pull off or even dare. Nazi Island, Rectum of the Year, Tried one of my Turds, Jeremy… War Criminals (from Lauscher) on QI,… hours of insanely great material. So much short answers that blew our minds. The wonderful mascots come to mind. “Keep it Light” was a piece of absolute genius. The final bit about the Talking Car defies belief! The one armed Pakistani juggler… Told in a way, one believed that it’s real. The children’s books, the boy struggling because of wearing a dress. “So he stops wearing a dress and he’s fine.” I must have watched the entire show at least 20 or 30 times.  By the way, this tribute is way too short and doesn’t do justice to his amazing body of comedic work. I will miss his voice. I can only think about all the amazing things he would have brought us in years to come. My heart goes out to his family. What an unthinkable loss. Sean is, always will be, the best hangover cure in the world!
Sean summed himself up best
awww crap a awesome lost to Comedy, Very sad
I am literally crying. 😭
He holds such a place in all our hearts
I thought my friend was playing a sick joke on me, then I googled Sean with trembling hand and burst into tears.
"I like to be more in touch with other people's feelings...so I could pinpoint their weaknesses and target them more effectively"  R.i.p Sean and Sean's tapeworm
Rip Sean. What an amazingly funny man x
What an absolute legend!! So sad he had to leave us way too soon. Since it's what he wanted: NOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAAH. You can't write tears indeed.
RIP Sean
Is it bad that I cried through this all while laughing
The carrot in the box champion. rest in piece dude , thanks for the laughs
I was so shocked to read this today. I only discovered this show 4 days back, have already seen all this clips and have been laughing hysterically because of Sean. Thanks for the laughs and your humour sean, you would have been pleased with the love and appreciation showered on you today. RIP
RIP Sean
Such a naturally gifted man who never failed to make me laugh.  You'll be sorely missed Sean.  May your memory be a blessing,
Going to miss Sean. He was a genuine comedy hero. Loved every minute he was on telly!
Such a shame his charisma and wit will be missed such a sick guyxx condolences to the family quality bloke
Watching 8 out of 10 cats clips had become a daily routine. Can't believe won't see Sean on it again. Just heartbreaking
Rest in peace Sean
You can't write tears Jimmy
RIP =( Can someone elaborate a little bit more on the cancer that he was battling?
rip sean
RIP Sean Lock. Legend.
Rest In Peace Sean. Thank you for all of the countless times you’ve made me crack up in laughter.
I'm 38 years old and today is the first time I've ever cried when a celebrity passed away. I'm in complete shock...
He will be missed. Classic absurdist British comedy. He had me in tears hundreds of times.
“You can’t write tears, Jimmy.”  Sean was absolutely right. Rest In Peace.
The only celebrity death that has ever gutted me 💔 Thanks for all the laughs Sean. He cheered me up whenever I needed it. R.I.P Sean Lock.
Literally just heard this news, what a massive loss to the world, man had a genius comic mind.
I can’t believe that he had to go so early
Truly sad news, brought a lot of joy into my life and others. Thank you Sean
Deffo not crying again… R.I.P 💔
8 out of 10 cats does Countdown will never be the same. Sean has huge shoes to fill as a genius and comedian.
R.I.P Sean, was funny asf and such a cool person
Legend. will be missed. =(
“You can’t write tears”
RIP, legendary
He was just so intuitively funny. His razor sharp wit, combined with his left of field, quirky style set him apart from his peers.  He was the backbone to both formats of 8 out of ten Cats. Whenever he was absent from the show, he left a hole. Now that he's moved on forever, it feels more like a stinging chasm. RIP the one of the funniest stars of this generation
I'm so sad. I loved this man, he was fantastic. Anyone else watching this laughing and remembering him, but forgetting what happened until that final picture of him comes up at the end ? Heartbroken for his family
Thanks for the laughs Sean! Undisputed carrot in a box champion, you will be sorely missed!
RIP
What a true legend this guy is rip Sean 🙏 you will always be remembered 💙
RIP Sean!! You have Given me countless hours and hours of laughs 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Sean Lock is and always will be an absolute legend
You didn't put "Carrot In a Box."
Incredible, incredible wit… this is such a loss. Thank you Sean.
I watch his videos almost every day and it’s weird to know someone who’s made you laugh so much in your darkest times is no more. Rest in peace Sean.
I miss him on the show already
Legend!
Rest in Peace, Sean. Gone, and never forgotten.
RIP Sean you gave me so much laughter!!
Thanks for the many laughs, Sean.
Love the fact there’s no ads on this,  class act Rip Sean
That last picture got me I'm afraid, thanks Sean xxx
This really is a challenging wank.
I'm an American who LOVES Sean Lock's wonderful, dry, lightning-fast wit. I am deeply saddened to learn he has left us.
RIP
This video could've been hours long, there's so many clips and bits to choose from. Never in my life has there been a death of a celebrity/comedian/ TV personality that has hurt me so much. Rest in peace Sean, you will be sorely missed by all.
No more challenging wanks
A true legend and a great example of comedic genius. He put his own twist on anything he could and from that he made millions of people cry of laughter. RIP Sean we will miss you forever ❤️
Rest in peace. A true legend of comedy 18/08/2021
Rip Sean Lock. He was one of the greatest comedians of all time and a great man. Also, he was king of the carrots in a box.
A great loss to the Comedy World. His Mr Beaujangles story always makes me laugh as does all of his comedy appearances. RIP.
RIP Sean. You'll be missed
A gifted comedian that brought laughter to many.
Legend!
RIP .YOU MADMAN!  "LOVED YOU N STILL DO". 😪♥️👓

F
Fabulous comic , clever and silly , always been my favourite . 15 storeys High is my fav sitcom . Very sad day , but if your legacy is making people laugh that is pretty cool . Bless him
A truly great comedian with an amazing rectum

O7
Came here to cheer myself up and stop feeling sad.  He did it again.  Thanks Sean
Sean brought so much laughter to me, this is one of the first times where I will properly miss a celeb. RIP sean x.
I had no idea...  The man was so effortlessly funny, he practically breathed humor  I'm sad to say his jokes won't continue through the future, but we can still remember him for all the smiles he brought. I'm thankful for the countless times he's brought me to chuckle until i wheezed.
Seriously a unique character, unlike any other, just himself as perfect as could be. He will never be forgotten.
Can’t believe Sados actually disliked this videos
Im so sad to hear this, what a great comedian he was. Il actually miss this man, i hope his family know how much he was loved and i wish them all the best.
Comedic legend, sheer brilliance of his delivery and jokes. I used to watch his videos for a pick me up on those tough days… never failed.  RIP Sean.
Sorely missed Sean. From West Belfast ❤️❤️🇮🇪
RIP Sean; the worlds best carrot in a box player and a true legend
I genuinely said “oh no” out loud to myself when I read of the news. The man was a genius of comedy I’ve had many a laugh thanks to him, it reminded me the way I felt when Rik Mayall left us. Rip Sean , I’m sure you’ll be making people laugh somewhere else now.
The Undefeated Carrot in a Box Champion. He brough me a ton of joy and laughs thru out the years.
He's a freaking legend he made that show I'd tune in for if he wasn't on the panel I'd skip it. 💙 RIP💙
Had me in tears of laughter every time I watched him, not today though, today my tears are for his family. R.I.P Sean, the world will be a sadder place without you
So heartbroken to hear the news today. We'll all miss you Sean. I loved when was paired with Miles Jupp. They bounced off each other so much.
Absolutely gutted!
"Rectum of the year" what a legend, RIP 💔
Cheers, Sean 🍻
Truly loved and adored by so many people i know…he will be sorely missed, he brought so much joy laughter and love to everyones lives….he will be sorely missed
RIP to one of the funniest ever
What a comedic genius. Gutted.
Thank you for the stitches over the years Sean, sleep easy.
I only recently discovered Sean and fell in love with his work. His quick wit and ability to land just about any joke with a straight face was incredible .8 out of 10 cats will never be the same without him. I am so sad to hear of his passing and my thoughts and prayers go out to all that were close to him. he's up in heaven now, fooling Jesus into thinking the banana is in his box lol.
RIP Sean, you will be remembered as one of the funniest men in the UK...
Sean was an absolute legend! RIP He will be missed.
"How do you stop a dog humping your leg? ...  Suck his cock." Sean r.i.p.
💛
Absolute genius
If this video was to contain all his moment of absolute comedic brilliance, it'd be 17 hours long. RIP Legend
I feel for all his family, friends, and fans including myself, honestly devastated and been entertained and always enjoyed his work and followed for many years. So many wonderful moments that will continue his legacy and still bring us joy as it did during his life, you will be sorely missed xx
Im still laughing as im sure most are. RIP and thankyou!
Hasn't sunk it that well never have new footage of this legend. One of the best of all time rip
Thanks to him I learned to embrace my strange sense of humour and his jokes never failed to make me belly-laugh. Absolute legend and a terrible loss. I have no words. Rest In Cat Litter, Sean Lock. We will miss you.
Rest in peace to a true comedic hereo.  You will be missed
Well … Sean finally got out of playing anymore countdown 👍🏼 RIP Sean, true comic talent, you’ll be sadly missed
RIP you absolute legend
If you were to look up the people who downvoted this in the dictionary you'd get a 4 letter word - one that has the letters C, U and T in it, but that word ISN'T cute.
Only recently discovered  the guy, but the number of laughs he has given me that have brought tears to my eyes are too many to count. His jokes will live on!
Rest in peace
A legend who got me through some of the harder times of my life. Never failed to make me laugh. A genius that will always be remembered by those he cheered up.
I can't count the times he made me laugh out loud. Love from canada
Shame he was hilarious
whos going to spit on miles now :( R.I.P bossman
One of the few people that had me in tears of laughter. RIP
Cute lol sweet dreams big man
Legend of British Comedy
Just four words describe Sean Lock to me: Carrot in a Box. 🤣😂😁
Just gutted.  One hell of a funny guy.
Just so incredibly saddened to hear of Sean's passing. He was just a joy to watch on stage or on TV. My most sincere condolences to his family and friends.
You never failed to make me laugh. Rest in peace Sean ♥ We'll always remember you.
The man was a legend
Rip he was such a joker sad to hear about this
I'd only discovered him in the last few months on these chat shows. He was always the funniest one there. And that Carrot In A Box game will stand the test of time.
Wait Sean Lock died? I didn't want to find out like this, not like this man
R.I.P To a legend. Your wit was beyond comprehension💙🕊️
I've seen Sean 4 times and watched him over and over on 8 out of 10 cats does countdown! Truly a great comedian and could turn any situation into a skit! I'm completely shocked & gutted 😢  a wonderful person, the world will be a lesser place without him.
Honestly don't believe it, he was only 58, he was and still is incredibly funny, can't believe he had cancer, man that kills me
I live in Denmark and didn’t know. Now I’m sad :-( I’m not crying! You’re crying!  RIP
You missed out one of his best moments: “If I could reanimate something, I’d reanimate all the leaders of the Nazi party… all the top Nazis..” “Just leave it there. Sean Lock everyone! Sean Lock everyone, that’s the end of his career. Roisin…” “No no no no!”
The comedian's comedian..... a true legend 👏🙌❤
The first stand-up comedian to play Wembley. RIP
The only reason I watched 8 out of 10 cats both countdown and normal version was for Sean.  Genuinely upset and hope his family get all the space they need, rest in peace you actual legend
Gutted I never got to see this genius live. One of the only comedians who has made me laugh out loud while watching alone. I will show my kids his material when they grow up so they truly understand the benchmark of a brilliant comedian. Rest easy Sean.
The Mobo awards got me. RIP Sean
Rest in peace Sean and thank you for the joy that you have given us over the years.
Every comment below is bullshit you seen him on this show all pretending he was a god  how many actually went see him
First Trevor Moore, now Sean Lock. Bad set of weeks. :/
R.I.P Sean Lock
Genuinely saddening, ffs man, no one has the sarcastic, weirdest, dry comedy edge like sean does, utterly unique  RIP Sean, you'll be remembered
Rest in Peace Sean, may you be getting pissed at how they run heaven !!!
NOOOOOOOOOOO, WHYYYYYYYYY? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Nazi Island anyone?
What dumbass decided to cut out the best part of Sean's proudest achievements?
I can’t believe this. I was so excited there was a compilation of Sean I had no idea he died or even had cancer wtf 😭 rip you hilarious asshole
I think he'd appreciate if we all said now: "That's a challenging wank."
True genius, will be sorely missed
I didn't even know he was sick...i hope he got to do it how he wanted.
:(
RIP Sean, you gave so much joy to so many people.
RIP Sean. I'm so gutted. Just like Jimmy Carr, I too am laughing and crying at the same time.
Out of respect for Sean they need to create the reality TV series of Nazi Island 😂😂😂
A titan of the British comedy scene. He will truly be missed.
R.I.P
So fucking sad. Love you sean.
He got me through some dark times with his humour. Eternally grateful. RIP Sean
I'm sad but you can't help but laugh with Shaun's jokes rip mate
Absolute legend
What a absolute legend such a funny guy you will be missed 😭
Rip  Sean,  absolute legend.
A whole 6 minutes. That's so lame. Hope there is a decent tribute made for Sean. R.I.P. and condolences to his family
Thank you for the years of belly laughs and laughing till we were crying. We will miss you Sean RIP X
Few Celebrity deaths have actually made me sad, but Sean Lock is one of them. He was robbed of so many opportunities, such as the time he said he would drive around listening to loud book tapes, but if there is one bright side to this, it's that he can't be trialled for his embezzlement. He made us all laugh at one point or another.  Rest in Peace, Sean.
RIP. He was a legend.
Very sad news, my thoughts to his family and friends.
Im so sad rn 🥺 he was my favourite
RIP Sir. Thank you for laughs.
Devastated.  This show and English comedy will never be the same.
I saw this and hoped he hadn't died but rest in peace Sean
You cant write tears Jimmy. RIP my hero.....
Hope he and his family know/knew what an impact he had on people's lives. Legend.
RIP Sean
The world is a less happy, less silly, less sarcastic place. So much irreverent joy he brought to so many.  Lit up every show he was on. Will be sorely missed.
My favourite qoute more or less is: "If you want to get a tape worn eat some pork(*finger guns) , If you want to get a tape worn eats some pork, not chicken beef or eggs.....  No luck you won't get a tape worm" I am definitely gonna miss this guy
BEAMRULES, so funny 😂
R.I.P. Sean Lock
Literally watched Sean Lock's 8 out of 10 cats best bits last night then found out the news today.  Absolutely gutted and devastated. An absolute comedic genuis, full of wit and charm. Will forever miss him.  RIP Sean Lock 😞💔
No more gems like Nazi island, his seal clubbing line, promising not to spit on miles and the book fit as a bakers dog which should be published
Rest in peace ❤️
What a loss, a sad day. He will be sorely missed,
Such sad news, what a legend
What an absolute legend. Such a sad loss.
“That’s a challenging wank”  Vale Mr Lock, you were one of the best of this era.
Wonderful man
Always looked forward to the openings of cats does countdown as you could guarantee his mascots or answers to Jimmy’s questions would have you in stitches. RIP Sean.
Half laughing, half crying. Thank you, Sean.
Brilliant man. Fuck cancer
So gutted he was one of my favourite comedian's, wherever he is now i bet he's making everyone laugh.
Can’t believe it rip
Sean was a legend, his stand up gigs were sensational and his tv appearances were hilarious, Sean will be missed greatly. RIP💙
Really liked this guy. So quick and funny. RIP. Shocked.
Why have some bell ends hit the dislike button? 🤬🤬🤬
Legend
He was so funny I teared up at the end rip sean
Noooooooooooooooo!!!!!
Wowsers. I didn't believe that final message reading RIP SEAN LOCK.
An absolute legend that will be sorely missed by so many. RIP Sean
No matter how sad we feel about Sean's passing away, and I do, but isn't it a beautiful acknowledgement that in the end we'll all be alright ... Sean is OK now. He dead. He don't care anymore. We love him anyway. Still, he's not gone .. he never will be, because he existed in his grand manner. Thank you Sean. See ya later.
He is dead?!?! :,( A TRUE comedic genious! RIP Sean
For some reason i thought sean would live forever,  one of the few comedians that was genuinely funny.
My favourite is his "Rectum of the Year" piece! RIP Sean.
He is such an embodiment of chaotic good. RIP :(
R.I.P. Sean Lock, one of my favorite comedians, was intelligent and out there in equal doses of brilliance.
God bless your Soul.  You were a very funny man.
They'll never be another like him. Rest happy in the ether Sean 🙏
When I got the chance to make it across the pond. I wanted to see Sean, and Mickey! This is just sad to know he’s gone. I can’t help but feel terrible for his family, I wish them the best and hope they know how much joy and laughter he gave to us all.
this has broken my heart. sean was an excellent comedian and played his character so, so well
This is gonna bring up some stuff.  He was a very talented man if you include tap dancing which I don't.  Absolute fucking legend.
RIP
I've spent most of my afternoon with youtube running through clips and compilations of this pure genius in the background. An absolute comedy genius, gone way too soon.
"Total comedy" 🤍
Rip ❤️❤️
So long Sean. Thanks for all the laughs.
Thanks for all the laughs, rip to a top bloke
cats and cats does countdown has been my go to place after work during the pandemic.  sean has pulled me out of some droll days many a time.  very very very smart funny man.

This was the man that kept me watching more and more Cats Does Countdown clips, absolutely gutted to have heard the news. Rest well Sean, you'll be dearly missed.

Such a sad day. RIP Sean. Thanks for the great laughs.
I didn't know he was ill, never mind terminal cancer. Absolutely shocking news. He seemed young and spritely. What an absolute shocker out of the blue.
Absolute legend. One of the few comedians who actually brought tears of joy to my eyes. RIP
I was so shocked to hear of his death. Such a legend and genuinely really funny. RIP Sean
A challenging wank
Absolutely devastated, one of my all-time favourite comics. RIP Sean Lock.
Omg what a guy 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
What a wonderfully grumpy, bitter yet witty and rip roaringly hilarious man Sean was. Spent many hours watching him and he made me laugh every time. RIP 🙏
I'm so terribly sad to hear this news. Sean was unique, a one-off, a comic genius. He will be so deeply missed. Bless you Sean, for all the laughter you gave us.❤️
An absolutely brilliant and hilarious human being, I've spent so many ours laughing at Sean's frankly wonderful sense of humour. Hopefully he's at peace, sleep well Sean and my thoughts are with your family and close ones.
Sean & 8 out of 10 Cats were all I watched when I was in my lowest points and they never failed to make me smile. Thank you Sean for all the joy you've brought the world despite being a massive grumpy sod lol. RIP Sean, your comedy will still bring laughter and joy for years to come.
R.I.P Sean u made me laugh til I cried
Thank you for the laughter
Rip
RIP
Saw he’d died when I woke up, another great gone, thoughts go out to his family and friends❤️ R.I.P Sean Lock🙏🏻

Rest in peace, Sean. I'm genuinely sad, he was a great comedian and writer. I'll miss him and his special comedic mind!
He was a great man
🙏🙏🙏
I have just recently discovered British panel shows here on YouTube and have loved getting to know comics like Sean... so sad to hear he is gone 😔
RIP Sean you will be really missed 😥😥😥😥😥
I can’t believe he’s actually dead. He’s probably the funniest person I’ve ever heard.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😔😔😔😔😔😔
Haven't been this shaken by a celebrity death since Stefan Karl Stefansson. RiP Sean, absolute pillar of comedy 💕
😔 😟 🙁 😥 😞 😿 😔 😟

This is so sad. RIP Sean!
Absolute legend. 8 out of 10 cats will never be the same without him.
Rip a legend of the trade and just a great human being. You will be missed Sean x
One hell of a comedian and these highlights prove that awesome
I can't even remember the amount of times I had tears of laughter from watching Sean Lock. His comedy and sense of humor brought me so much joy and I think everyone will miss him dearly. Rest in Peace you absolute legend.
Very sad news, such an amazing comedian. A very big loss to comedy 🙁
Absolutely in shock. Only know him since recently on YouTube and the Countdown clips. Cannot believe he is gone. Legendary humour. RIP 😢

Rectum of the year .. I haven't laughed as hard in ages. What a wonderful comedian he was.

R.I.P. to one of the funniest comedians period! Will be missed.
NOOOO! Sean Lock was one of my favorites, and still so young :(
rip
Carrot in a box. That’s all I need say. RIP Sean Lock, you absolute legend.
Im just so happy Youtube took me down the rabbit hole to British tv so I could meet this amazing man.
Incredibly funny man. So shocked to hear of his passing. The world just got a lot less funny.
Absolutely gutted that he's gone but incredibly grateful for all the time that we had him around. ❤
I have watched Sean for several years here on Youtube, and he brought many a smile to my face. RIP, Sean.
"I dont want to be buried or cremated, i want to be fly tipped" - sean lock   Forever my favourite quote from the man
what a loss for laughter everywhere
Carrot in a box , now I'm in a box ! I know you would laugh at that , going to miss you , you funny fucker! All the best to your family sean :) x
RIP Sean
Rip Mr Lock.
Made me laugh all the way from Australia. A challenging w*nk, carrot in a box, won't spit on you during s*x tonight, and the list goes on. Will be sorely missed Sean. RIP champ. 🇬🇧🇦🇺
Rest in peace my condolences to the family
:'/ Thanks for all the laughs dear man! R.I.P.
A king amongst men.
Holy shit, how did he die. He was the funniest guy on this show. Only a young guy aswell.
Everyone go and watch 15 Storeys High - they're all on youtube. And the radio show 15 Minutes Of Misery. Utter genius.
funny man RIP
He was so talented! I loved his Carrot in a box!
I don't think I've gone from a belly laugh to sobs so quickly.
Such a funny guy made me laugh countless times r.i.p sean you will be missed
I was watching an old 8ootcdc this morning, then turned on the news to see he had died. He was an absolute brilliant comic
What a bloke. Will be sadly missed.
A wonderful, funny man. Thanks for the laughs Sean RIP.
So many British comedians are over-rated, Sean wasn’t one of them. Consistently one of the funniest out there. R.I.P.
R.I.P funny man I'm absolutely gutted
Havent really cared about a celebrity death in probably a decade, but this one hit me. Also I'm not one for celebrity news so I had no idea he was sick, quite out of the blue this...  Fuck. You'll be missed, Sean.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYY NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AAAAAAAAAAA, RIP u legend
I'm an American and so I never got the exposure to British comedy as people across the ocean did. Nonetheless I randomly clicked on a 8oo10cdc video one day and I instantly fell in love with British comedy, and watching hundreds of hours of episodes and seeing Sean Lock being endlessly funny made me have a connection to this comedy, and I will be forever grateful to Sean for helping me feel connected to it. Rest in peace Sean, and up there know that you made millions laugh and smile every day, and you were a bigger part of our life than you realize.
Cheers from the US I’ve been enjoying countdown over the last year or so thanks for the laughs never forget Sean got the carrot…love!
RIP Sean. thank you for being YOU!! 🙌🙌
Thank you for all the laughs! May you rest in peace, and always find a carrot in your box.
Very sad to hear this today. Always thought he was an absolute comedy legend.
He gave smiles to anyone who watched him! A truly hilarious man! RIP to an underrated legend of British TV!
This news is hitting me so hard
Legend
I know Claudia Winckleman is an easy audience, but I think she needed oxygen in that last clip.   I was hoping for one of Sean's books like Tiger in the Pub or A Gritter's Tale
Heard about this this morning always brought alot of laughs and seemed to care for others and his family will be missed.
Sat here welling up... His take on the world will never be rivalled and he will be sorely missed. My heart goes out to his family and friends x
😪
My favourite of the bunch, so sad❤️❤️❤️
Bye Sean x
Ive been binge watching this series and i cant believe hes gone now... Will miss those hilarious speeches and mascots he delivered. RIP
Such sad news. He was a funny man. We will always have Carrot in a Box. Rest in peace.
Thank you Sean Lock 🌹🌹
What a very funny man will be missed here in Oz greatly as in the hearts of many
I'm rarely shocked by celebrity deaths, but my jaw genuinely dropped when I read this. I didn't even know he was sick. What a loss. Thanks for all the great laughs, you miserable bastard.
One of the best comedians there ever was, rest in peace sean
Gutted, loved him
What an amazing tallent, he will be missed
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"  You can't write tears, Jimmy.
So shocked to learn he’s passed. Thanks for all the laughs, Sean! R.I.P.
I've been told to "man up" a few times in life but I think myself and every other bloke who genuinely loved sean lock is allowed to shed a few tears. Only a few celebs have got me through some dark times and he is one of them. Rik mayall, karl pilkington, sean lock and george carlin are those celebs. Thanks for all of the laughs sean! RIP X
@Channel 4 Please release his fragrance!  Love ya Sean   R.I.P
This is too sad. I loved Sean Lock and will miss him. A genius comic and one of the greats. Goodbye Sean and rest in peace.
He's joining Phil Hartman as the only two celebrities whom I'll genuinely miss.
And now there's no chance Jon can redeem himself and win the carrot in a box competition instead of Sean.  Comedy legend. 8 out of 10 cats will never be the same.
The world is an infinitely less funny place with “Lock’o”.
Carrot in a box legend, going to miss him so much.
Rest in peace Sean. Thanks for the laughs.
Its still that bit on Big Fat Quiz of the Year when he has a go at those child actors which cracks me up... R.I.P Sean
Have to be honest I discovered Sean through 8 out of 10 and his delivery was just hilarious. The way he could keep his composure when telling a joke even when it sounded truly ridiculous I half thought he was telling the truth. Spent many hours watching the show in tears at just how funny he was. May he RIP - will be truly missed.
All the times this man made me laugh was a priceless gift. Thanks a lot Sean. You will be greatly missed.
Perfect opening
There will be generations of comedians to come who will cite Sean Lock as a big inspiration in their lives and what made them want to do comedy. He will be judged alongside many of the greats of British comedy and one of those comedians definitely never forgotten. Deepest sympathy for his family.
Slowed down for a horse,will miss his wit!
God fucking damn we’re gonna miss him so bad, if I ever felt down I could watch him for even a few minutes and I’d be grinning from ear to ear like an idiot, what an absolute class act.
Taken at such a young age.  Anybody that’s make people laugh is a God in my eyes.  R.I.P Sean
R.I.P Sean. Sad day 🌹
One of the best comedians ever, RIP Sean
He was the best comedian on TV by a country mile. What a loss. RIP Sean
8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown carried me through a rough time in my life - I needed to escape and have some laughs. Thank you Sean, and rest easy.
Thank you for this❤️
Absolutely gutted.. he was a genius
So sad he passed away! His videos will remain in our hearts.
Absolute Legend. RIP
such a sad loss, he made people so happy and will continue to do so forever
This needs to be at least 45 mins this guy was an absolute legend he will be missed 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Rip good guy
o7

He was ace, that stuffed ferret pen had me laughing for weeks. RIP
This guy has seen me eat breakfast for 4 years watching there highlights over and over again, he will be missed, no more carrot in the box :(
I will not see carrots the same way anymore... rest in peace Mister Sean Lock, master of poker face, gentleman of the bluff, whelk eater, best opponent of Jon Richardson and best captain ever of countdown, you have made me laugh so hard... Merci Monsieur
Absolute comedic brilliance. RIP
Properly gutted, possibly my favourite comedian. Made me laugh out loud constantly.  He was a comic genius and will be sorely missed. RIP Sean,keep them laughing up there.
Couldn't take any more than 30 seconds, how far up his own arse must he be to have an ego that size, unbelievable
Rip Sean. Such a character.
I’m an American so I had no idea he had died till just a few minutes ago. He was one of my top 3 favorite comedians. It’s really sad. He wasn’t even that old. Cancer is a bitch. Smh.
:’(
RIP to a legend
RIP Sean. A genuinely funny bloke.
Rest In Peace Sean!! You have given me so many laughs through the years. More than any other!! You helped me so much 10 years ago when my father died of cancer (at the age of 58).  Thank you for everything!!
Gutted
One of my all-time favourite comedians. A very sad loss to the entire comedy World. 😢
Lots of comments saying rest in peace...  I think it's far more fitting to say rest in cynical irritation.
Legend
What a legend... He will be missed...
RIP Sean Lock.
What a beautiful person sean was he made me laught  so much   will miss him   condolence to his family
Fucking legend.
Great loss. He'll be very missed.
Sean Lock is one of my favourite comedians. As much as he'll be missed by us all, he's made us all laugh and we'll remember him as one of the greats. Rest in Peace <3
Made me laugh more than anyone, and turned panel shows into 'event TV' when I was a teenager. It's really touching how hard this news has hit so many people. Thanks for everything Sean.
Really terrible news, and very sad. Great comedian and a genuinely nice guy.
Today i was on a bing of 8oo10c/dc for the 3000'th time this pandemic, as always still laughing at all the brilliant shenanigans. The sad news of Sean's passing hits extra hard and ruthless. Indeed tears can't be written Sean, but today all of us try our best in honor of your genius. My heartfelt condolences to his wife, young children and family. Thank you for all the laughter's Sir Lock! 💔
Still, one of my very favorite ones was Carrot In A Box (the first time they played it during the Christmas season). Utter genius! Then, of course, was Nazi Island. Brilliance made even better by Jimmy Carr and Rosin.
I’ve spent hours upon hours watching 8 out of 10 cats does countdown just to see Sean make jimmy cry with laughter. He will be sorely missed. A very sad day 💙
Living in the States, I only found 8 out of 10 cats a couple of years ago.  I have watched so many hours of episodes and clips.  Sean Lock is an amazing talent, and a hilarious part of Cats, and Cats Does Countdown.  He will be missed.  Rest in Peace, Mr. Lock.
First heard of him when the Carrot in a Box bit popped up in my recommendation. He was a legend. And forever will be.
I had no idea he was sick. Terribly sad
So sad im gonna miss him r.i.p
My favourite Sean Lock moment was his rant on Childrens acting, hysterical! RIP
R.I.P. You legend.
One of my favorite comics. His humor was and will be funny to me and many more people. RIP
I will miss him greatly
ledge!
I was shocked and saddened to hear of his death.  He was wonderfully funny and acerbic. My heart goes out to his family.
He will be missed by everyone.  RIP Sean  Nooooooooooooo Whyyyyyyyyy
One funny fu¢ker. RIP you legend 🍻
Channel 4, please publish "The Tiger Who Came for a Pint".
Very sad to hear of Sean's passing - an all time great.
NOOOOOOO WHHHYYYYYYYYY!!!!!
RIP you crazy diamond
8 people are soulless arseholes that didn’t deserve the genius of Sean Lock
There’s less laughter in the world today and that’s always something to care about. R.I.P Sean. A remarkable comedian and man.
Not bloody long enough. 🎃☠️
Thanks, Channel 4. We'd all be happy to know Sean and Diego can have a rematch now. Rest in peace, legends.
Such an incredible mind. A singular personality and one of the most talented comedians ever. I am so appreciative of the laughs he has given us over the years. God Bless you Sean and prayers to your family, you will be missed
Man, Sean Lock. What a great comedian. As an American I fell in love with him and this show, it’s a devastating loss.
legend!!
such sad news. top comedian.
<3
This man made me laugh for effing years and there was a time when i could tell he was seriously ill , but whatever issue he had (which we now know what was), was well hidden from the public. I will never forget him and the joy he has bestowed upon me RIP xxxxxx
Simply one word, 'legend'
Wait, what? Sean died?
one of the truly great comedians of our age, and I still believe not fully as appreciated as he should be. RIP
He made me laugh, right out of my personal loss last year. Too soon Sean, too 100 yrs soon 😪 🙏🏼 ॐ शांति 🙏🏼
Absolutely devastating, there'll never be another Sean Lock.
Legend.
Brilliant, original and a one off for sure........Rest in peace and thanks for all the laughs
Thank you for the many tears that I cried laughing and RiP Mr Lock. Genius.
Love from Canada.  He will be missed.
Fucking gutted I am to hear of his passing. Damn it ,man!
There's not many comedians who can make people cry laughing.  RIP.
😟
No way(((
The picture at the end is perfect!
RIP Shean, your comedy has cheered me up many a time and helped me and I'm sure a lot more through tough times, a massive loss :(
Probably one of the funniest men to have lived. RIP to a legend!
Devastated to hear this. RIP Sean
Never know what you've got til it's gone. Absolute legend, given so many headaches with laughing.
James Corden using his phone under the table and not paying attention to greatness
The best, end of.
Fantastic comedian. Will be remembered for ever. Rip Sean.
We've lost an absolute legend of comedy, condolences to his family at this very sad time.
Rip Sean, cheers for all the laughs
This one hurt. Sean will be missed. Legend
I never thought that I would be as choked up as I am about this.  A comedy legend!
I am really going to miss Sean he is such a talent. He really makes me laugh. RIP Sean
I knew this was coming for a while, but that hasn't made it easier
The man is responsible for me belly laughing more than any other comic. I will miss him. Absolute legend.
I love Seans humour, such a legendarily "try cancel me, you can't" style behind it that I really respect, his Nazi island idea alone would end anyone else's career. If I ever saw another comedian live I always hoped it would be Sean
CARROT IN A BOX!!
Such a joy to have seen him perform at the Edinburgh Playhouse. The most I have laughed at any show. And his appearances on QI and 8 Out Of 10 Cats are always memorable. Clips of his shows are always on my YouTube feed and they always made me laugh, no matter how many times I watched them. He will be sorely missed 💔  Much love to his family.  Thank you for all the laughs, Sean ❤
He really exceeded the levels of dry sarcastic humour. R.I.P Legend. I'm really trying not to be sad. I still can't come to terms with the fact he's gone.
God bless mate.
Whoever’s disliked this video you are disgusting humans🤷‍♀️ rip me lock we all love you and your Whitty personality ❤️❤️
Fucking legend. Godspeed, Sean.
Totally shocked, Rest in peace Sean & thank you for the laughs 💔💔
❤
Couldn't believe the news when I saw this. I fucking hate cancer! Thank god for CH4 compilations of him and his CH4 Cats does Countdown family, it brings a smile every time I watch one, no matter how many times I've seen it. I hope he had a "Challenging Wank" before departing (that line had me in stitches and still does). RIP Sean :(
God bless you Sean lock, you will  be so so missed
rip funny man
Really sad to hear this. Such a funny man.
When I’m down Sean was my go to guy with many other comedians I’ll forever be watching your best bits and stand up Rest easy Mr Lock  ❤️
R. I. P. Sean Lock. 8 Out Of 10 Cats (Does Countdown) will never be the same.
We are going to miss you Mr. Lock. Thanks for all you done for us.
Man, I hate it when people die. He was a right good laugh.
An absolutely amazing man. Shocked when I first heard the news. The world will never be the same without him.
Such sad news to here about Sean’s passing I will miss his comedy so much my thoughts and prayers go out to his family at this very sad time.
R.I.P. Mr Sean lock 😥
RIP Mr Lock🌹
Incredibly sadnned by the horrible news. May he rest in peace :(
What a great funny man , so sad he has moved on , but he has left us with so many funny times ,
My favorite comedians of all time. I've watched him practically daily for years, and I know I'm not alone. Normally not too bothered by celebrities passing, as I don't feel I know them. This however hit really hard. Rest in peace Sean.
As Jon Richardson said, “ Undisputed, undefeated, carrot in a box champion. I will miss him.”
We shouldn't be saying goodbye man this guy is genuinely hilarious, such a shame another lovely guy gone but never missed. <3
Comedy genius will be missed 😭
Fuckin cancer, always takes the best. RIP, Sean.
I'm absolutely sickened he's gone
thats a challenging wank - Sean Lock
Brilliantly funny. His humour was loved by many what a way to be remembered. RIP Sean you made me laugh so hard
So many laughs.  My heart goes out to his family and loved ones.  He (and his great talents) will be missed.💖
My favourite comedian - we're all gonna miss you so much
You cant write tears jimmy.
Absolutely will be missed... so many laughs especially during these last eighteen months. RIP sir! from across the pond.
Nooooooooo arrrrrrghhhhh nooooooooo
Will truly be missed. His sardonic and quick wit were remarkably brilliant. Thanks for all the laughs mate.
I thought this was just another compilation until I saw the ending shot and read the description. Not how I wanted that news to be broken but RIP.
I didn't really know Sean outside of Countdown, but always thought he was an absolute legend. He often had me in tears, especially with his greatest achievements, which included seal clubbing and winning rectum of the year (I knew I’d won when I heard three of the judges throwing up behind me). I often come back to Sean when I need cheering up, and it never fails.  The guy was a legend, and will be sorely missed. RIP, Sean, and much love to your family.
RIP Sean. It's heartbreaking that we won't be able, to see your comic genius again. Gone far too soon.😢
A legend
Rest in peace Sean Lock, you absolute legend.
What an amazing imagination!
this is just the same countdown clips that are on every other video
rest in piece, an icon of British comedy
Loved the guy a will miss him, a brilliant zany comedian, always on point RIP Sean you gave me so much pleasure over the years
Goddamit. This is a hell of a way to find out.
God damn. This sucks. He was one of the funniest guys on 8 out of 10 Cats. RIP Sean. Thank you for all the laughs you gave me and others.
Sad day for English comedy. Rest in peace. We will all miss your quick wit
rest in peace sean lock
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
I'm so happy to see how many people this mans work has touched. Truly one of the greatest of our generation, So effortless, and pure
Gutted
RIP he was real comic genius and will be missed.
Man, I’m going to miss Sean Lock.
RIP.
😢
"You can't write tears Jimmy." Sure you can. 😥😢😭
Gonna miss ya pal
Rest in peace
He is a comedic genius, he never fails to make me laugh, his sense of humor is fucking great. Fairwell to a true legend, you won't be forgotten as your genius is archived in these videos and our hearts.
Its hard to express how sad it is to lose such a brilliant guy.  RIP Sean
Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck, gutted, R. I. P. Sean. 😢🎃☠️
Well this news hit me like a tone of bricks. I was just watching a compilation of him on Cats does countdown this morning.
Ty Sean for all the laughter, RIP
RIP Sean Lock He will forever be the master of Carrot in a Box. I bet Jon still won't be able to figure out if there's a carrot in Sean's (forever)box or not. It would be brilliant if his last note to Jon was "Wanna trade boxes?"  Sean was one of my all time favorite comedians. He will definitely be missed.
RIP Sean Lock.  Someone who always has me falling off my chair with tears of laughter in my eyes.  He'll be sadly missed.  A genius.
legend
Had the pleasure of seeing him live a few times never cried with so much laughter like that thank you Sean you will be missed RIP mate
people who thumbs down this video are snowflakes RIP Sean gone too soon never forgotten fly high legend
The video is titled A Tribute To Sean Lock, but we are the ones to recieve the gift of his comedy. Thanks for all the laughs Sean. The first comedian to play Wembley.
I will seriously miss Sean. 😢😢 What a talant

RIP to the man who didn't even know me but helped me in many ways

RIP SEAN LOCK ♥️🙏🙏
First thing I did when I heard was watch the carrot in a box video. Still makes me laugh every time. RIP Sean lock. You will be missed badly
Aw no.......Damn   That's a shame   A very funny man
Yep the rectum of the year bit still sends me into tears everytime
Rest in peace, you legend.
That sucks. I love this guy. He was so funny.
Gutted beyond belief. Was so looking forward to his next live show and his take on the world around us.  RIP Sean...a LEGEND 🤣 and a Treasure 😪
I loved his laugh during Joe’s poem.
Absolute legend cracking dry sence of humour and quick witted
RIP legend
Damn! RIP Sean. Thanks for all the laughter. You're a legend.
6 min video that's funnier than most comics entire careers we need people like Sean and now he's gone..devastating
I can't imagine what his family and friends are going through at the moment. I just hope that at some point they get some comfort knowing how much joy and happiness he brought to people. I've had so many nights over the years staying up watching Sean Lock clips until 4am and I'm sure I'll have many more. What a legend and he will never be forgotten
Well that was a challenging wank. Rip Sean.
genius sad to hear of his  passing
Thank you Sean, for all the laughs & funny moments. Rest in Peace. One of the best comedians 💗
Warmest of love to his family. Thank you Sean for the laughs.
...I really hope that the BBC will re-air FIFTEEN STOREYS HIGH as a tribute to this great comedian, we'll all miss his classic left-field humour ...R.I.P Sean .
So sad.  His humour kept me going in some of my darkest days.  Wish his family the best and hope they will be alright
Gawd bless him, i set the sprinklers off at work today as a tribute. He will be much missed.
RIP Sean, and thank you for being so awesome and a huge part of my laughs in the past years
RIP to the Carrot in the Box Champion.
Another great man lost fuck cancer 😡RIP Sean, you have brought me great laughter while watching you you will be missed 🥺
Absolute legend! One of my favorites gone too soon. I am very thankful for the time we had to enjoy his laughter. Best wishes to his friends and family.
I am a absolutely shocked. Made every one look like amateurs on this show.
So sad to hear about Seans passing 😢💔 He will allways be remebered as the comic genius and just straight up god person that he was  and he will be dearly missed!! All love to his family in this hard times❤️❤️
It is so heart breaking looking back at Sean Lock videos and every one of them has that thumb lit up in blue already. Not often have I actually been personally saddened by a celebrity passing but this is different. Sean has left this world and took soo much laughter with him. A legend.
I admire anyone who’s able to make Jimmy Carr cry with laughter. Sad Sean’s passed on, however I’m happy we will all still be able to watch and laugh at all his appearances.
Umm, what the fuck? Has he actually passed away because this is the first I'm hearing of it. If it's true then RIP 🙏 Ok it is true, that's depressing.
The shameless self-promotion in the description really brings home the sincerity of your loss, channel 4. Classy.
RIP Legend
legend
who the fuck would dislike this
Funny funny man
I am completely gutted by this. Every time I am down or upset I watch clips of him. He has never failed to make me belly laugh! R.i.p :(
I didn't know he was ill so this is a shock.  He was a brilliant comedian and came across as such a genuine nice man. Life can be so unfair at times. He will be missed immensely by many I'm sure. The world was a nicer place with Sean in it.
I was concerned when I noticed his raspy voice, as it might be a symptom of paralysis of a certain nerve in lung cancer, but hoped it wasn't this in Sean's case. Alas...
Such a fitting tribute to share some of his best jokes. Definitely how he'll be remembered. Thanks for the laughs, Sean.
💔
RIP Sean, what an incredible talent taken from us too soon
Absolute legend. Such a shame.
R.I.P Sean you legend
Rest in peace, legend 🙏🏻
Can not believe he has gone  R.I.P Sean one of the best
Legends never die 🤣🤣🤣
What a guy 💔 he will be missed
Lost for words. Such a talented & natural comedian. Always associate Sean with 8 out of 10 Cats. He made the shows. Always looked forward to seeing the mascot part of the show. And he didn’t have to try being funny 😂
He was my favourite member on the panel, thank you Sean.
It never seemed like he was trying too hard to impress just effortlessly funny. He perfected his style and he will be greatly missed.
I thought the title of this video was just a tribute to Sean bc he left the show... I didn't know he passed away. RIP Sean Lock. We will miss you terribly
R.I.P Sean you absolute legend ♥️
RIP Sean, you will be sorely missed, condolences to the family.
i only just started to rewatch 8 out of ten cats countdown and its so hard to carry on watching it knowing this man was robbed of having many more amazing years. rest in piece sean you will never be forgotten
Such a shame,a very funny guy!really had me laughing out loud many times!
I just finished laughing my buttocks of on one of these videos. Went to check on a news app and found out about it. I was devastated by the news. I wish his family well, you will be missed Sean.
Guy was fearless, loved his style of comedy and will be missed! RIP
A great talent for humour taken much too early in his life.
I felt gutted when I heard the news. I have only known about Sean and 8 out of 10 cats for like 2 years but absolutely love the humour Sean provided. Rest in peace!
It doesn’t seem real. He will never ever be forgotten.
If you’re not crying while watching this, I don’t know what’s wrong with you.   Wether that’s crying with laughter or sorrow.   Rest in peace, Sean.
Sean has made me laugh. Now Sean has made me laugh with tears. Thank you for bringing joy to me over the years.
:(
My favourite comedian. Love from Iceland.
Terrible loss, he was so funny
Ahhhh what the fuck...
RIP Sean 💙💙💙💙
This is so sad. Sean is the reason i started to watch 8 out of 10 cats. He will be missed.
They should play "Sean in a box" at his funeral, with 2 coffins. Maybe Jon Richardson would finally win! But my money is still on Sean  Rest in peace Sean
Honestly the first time I've been genuinely sad about the passing of someone I didn't know. Thank you for the endless supply of laughs!
What a guy
❤️
Was fortunate enough to see him perform live in my town. Easily one of the best comedians ever.
I had no idea until i saw this.. Gutted.. Legend..
Legend
I’m just in shock. A great man has been lost today. Thanks for the laughs Sean
Very sad to see & hear this! R.I.P. Sean & thank you for all the laughs
I was hoping to see Sean Lock in a future season of Taskmaster, he would have been simply amazing at it... RIP Legend.
crying with laughter, I miss him already.
NOOOO!!! WHYYYYYYY!!!! NOOOOO!!!! AAAAHHHHHH!!!!
Thank you, you beautiful man. Rest in peace <3
R.I.P Mr Jangles
Rip Sean thank you for making me laugh always you will be sadly missed you legend my condolences 😢🙏🏽
RIP such a great witty guy
So gutted. Such a huge loss. Thank you for all the hilarious memories Sean. May you keep them laughing up there as much as you had us laughing here.
I honestly can't believe he's gone, he was truly hilarious and such a good man. Definitely a favourite of mine. I'll forever be grateful for the joy he bought to my life. RIP Sean, thank you for the endless laughs and love you bought to everyone's lives , we love you <3
Given the state of everything, we needed Sean these days more than ever, but, it's time to rest now. You came into the world with a goal, and you achieved it. Thank you for all the laughs. You will be so very missed.
I guess God needed a laugh after all this misery, so he took Sean Lock away from us.
I loved Sean.  His wit & persona was the best in comedic form that I have ever seen. He will be missed🎗️
Brilliant funny clever man
I spent the last whole summer watching him, and I was laughing every single day. R.I.P. you comedy legend.
Was truly gutted at reading the news of his passing.  Will massively miss his humour and quick wit.
Today is a national tragedy of British Comedy. He will be forever remembered
💔💔💔
In such a tragic world, he brought such joy in his best way. God, I will miss Sean. His comedy and personality was something you could never replicate.
I'm devistated... RIP funny man...
Rest in peace to the one who knew how to make us laugh through our TV screens...
Rest in peace...one of the funniest people I have ever come across. Condolences to his family
Pure Genius.....RIP Sean
This had to be one of the hardest edits ever to summarise one comedian, that's how legendary he was. RIP
total injustice  mrs brown still around too
Or the time I went seal clubbing
Oh no. way to early
Such a great comedian! Very funny, such a shame he has passed away, my thoughts go out to his family and friends.
04:42 I remember watching this episode when it aired and thought he didn't sound right now. Now we know. Such a sad day
I genuinely just can’t comprehend that he’s gone. I’ve been watching him on 8 out of 10 Cats since I was a kid 🤍 sending so much love to his family and friends 🤍
One of the greatest comedians ever and one of my person favourites fuckin sorely missed, thanks Sean mate.
Legends don't die... ❤
Was genuinely gutted when I woke up to the news this morning. Love watching his clips on YouTube and he will be missed by many for a long time to come 🥺
He was an absolutely incredible comedian. One of my favourites if not the favourite. He had a quality that nobody else had
He was a comical genius. He will be missed. May he RIP
Absolutely gutted.  He's a comic genius, from Nazi Island to rectum of the year and the carrot in a box.  I always watch his clips and he makes me laugh out  loud time after time.  RiP
Gutted ! RIP ⭐️
RIP
Man, I'm gonna miss him so much.
Cats does countdown will not be the same. RIP Sean, really loved your comedy.
Absolutely one of the greatest comedians of our time. There was never a thing he said that didn’t make people cry with laughter. Sean will be dearly missed R.I.P xx
❤❤❤
Cheers Sean... You deserved better. RIP

Now who’s going to put in the light bulbs on Christmas morning? Gutted. I loved his style of humour.
Laughing through the tears.
Och no man! This is such sad news. Rest in Peace and THANK YOU for the many times you had me in stitches.
He once said: “When I die, I’d like my ashes scattered in Piers Morgan’s eyes.”
The best. Watch the same clips over and over and still cry. I'll miss him. 🇨🇦
RIP Sean. You made the world a better place, and the pandemic easier to manage.
Been waiting for this today, thank you for this video for Sean! 🙏 He'll be missed by so many
I'm devastated.
Can’t remember ever being so upset about a celeb dying. My favorite comedian… I only watched 8/10 cats for him! 😞 😢
Damn, what a punch to the gut. I've watched so many of these clips I feel like I know the guy.
Great compilation! Rest easy Sean ! Made me belly laugh multiple times ! Sleep well
So down about this icon of comedy passing away ...he was a genius ...thoughts and love to his family and friends of which he has millions .
Undefeated carrot in a box champion. Rectum of the year. Talisman of British comedy. Irreplaceable
Comedy world lost a great one today. His first carrot in a box will always be one of my favorites.
I alway looked on this guy like that cool next door neighbour thats got jokes when his wifes back is turned .... RIP brother
Rest in peace Sean, thank you for the wonderful, wonderful time.
really think this video you shouldnt have plugged all your social links in the description...
rest in peace Legend!
From Moscow, Russia: Noooooo! Whyyyyyyy?! Noooooo! Aaaaaah!.. With love.
Just started watching these clips recently, Sean quickly became my favorite. He will be missed greatly! RIP Legend ❤️
RIP Sean 🙏
man.
Awesome 👏🏼
A great loss very funny man
Swear to God, I still can't fucking fathom this is real. I literally gasped when I read the news at work. Comedy legend, one of the best in his generation. He may be gone, but the joy he brought us will always last <3
Was honestly a crime not to feature the Carrot in a Box moment. I recommend you all look for it, was an excellent clip showing Sean Lock's comedy and genius. Gone but never forgotten.
RIP, legend
Thank you for everything, Sean.
The world   is very short of  comedians  and one of our finest have been taken from  us far to early,  He will be sadly missed  God bless you and make them all laugh up there,  By my friend.
One of the best moments in comedy show history: Miles Jupp grabbing Sean’s photo as a family piece and Sean cracking up like crazy.   Rest In Peace Sean, you were fantastic.
Rest in peace, dear Sean!
So many iconic moments that we all share.  From the 'Challenging w***' to my stand up fave of hitting a budgie with a tea spoon.   Rest in peace you totally awesome Man.
What a man
What a devastating news. Rest in Peace!
Sean was the reason i watched 8outof10cats, what a legend he was, hope his family is doing ok. A real loss for the comedy  entertainment world
A comedians comedian. RIP to a generational comedy genius.
You could honestly have a 5 hour tribute video and it would all be funny. One of the funniest comedians of this century, he'll be sorely missed
So sad. He was such a brilliant comedian. RIP
You got me through quarantine and some really hard times. Big love, you’re an absolute Legend.
As an American this hit me hard too ruined my day. I'm sure he would have liked that.
So sad hearing today Sean lock has passed away. He will really be missed for a long time to come.
"what would be the definition of sean lock?"   Legend
Rest in peace, Sean.
RIP Sean. Nothing will ever be as funny as the carrot in a box bit 😢
Fucking legend. Absolutely gutted. Can't express it.
6 minutes isn't enough. There's so much amazing stuff from him.
one of my biggest regrets is not going to see him live. genuinely gutted, RIP
NOOOOOOOOOO! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! NOOOOOOOOOO!  RIP Sean Lock 😢😢😢
Irreplaceable
RIP legend
Shocked! 😔 RIP
This is terrible news! R.I.P. Sean, 8 out of 10 won't be the same without you. 😿😿
Just can’t believe it, SL was by far the best comedian ever for me, this is a really sad day. I watched CDCD  just last night when he did his a to z drink lol. The best one is the spitting thing with Jimmy. I don’t recall anyone making JC laugh that much.
No other comedian makes me laugh quite like Sean does, rest easy man.
RIP Sean I feel so sad, the news were a shock to me I was watching clips of him and laughing my heart out the other day and today I couldn't believe that he passed away, a great natural witty comedian and a personal favorite. so sad
Most bingeable panel comedian ever!
RIP Sean
Nooooooo!!! Whyyyyyy!!! Nooooooo!!! Ahhhhhhh!!!
This could be much much longer - RIP
Who the f*** disliked this.
Never cried about a celeb before but couldnt believe this...just heart breaking. Only discovered the show half a year ago but watched every episode of it and Sean just became my favourite all time comedian...and now hes gone. RIP.
One of my favourite comedians over the years. Will miss him greatly!
Very sad to hear the news about Sean Lock passing away, will miss him dearly 😢❤️
Sean 😭
Eau de Sean Lock.
The swapped envelopes, did not see that coming. Genius. RIP
:(
I was watching him last night, just now heard RIP Sean.
RIP Sean, absolute legend
My first thought upon finding out was, "Well, that's a challenging wank!" Hey, he'd have laughed. I will greatly miss your twisted, brilliant, hilarious wit, Sean. You were one of the best.
RIP mate you was a true legend x love to all your family and friends you left behind…. Oh and to the prick that thumbs downed this video I hope your bollocks fall off or tits what ever you are x love me 😉🥰x
I'm really gonna miss him.
Completely shocked and seeing the headline this morning, my heart goes out to his family and friends. He made me laugh so much in 8outof10 a true old school comedian (please know that this is an absolute complement NOT an insult) may he be with all the greats making the rest of heaven laugh💗😓💗😓
You can bet that this video will get over 100 times more views than any of channel 4's woke Youtube videos. R.I.P Sean Lock. Legend.
Im crying
This is horrible. Gonna miss him so much ❤😢
Can everyone please stop dying. Especially If I'm fond of you. thanks x.
Celebrity deaths don't usually affect me, I mean, it's sad, but I can usually get on with my day. But hearing about Sean's passing really hit me hard, and I know it's the same for millions of others. He truly was one of our greatest comedians of all time, loved by everybody. Rest in peace Sean, you magnificent bastard. You'll be missed and remembered by pretty much the whole nation.   It's gonna take some time to get myself over this one...
He brought so much humor in the world. He will be missed.
RIP to a legend.
In actual disbelief, he helped me through some tough parts of my life without even knowing... RIP.
I was devastated I didn’t believe it at first. thank you for the many years of laughs. R.I.P Sean
Keep on keeping on❤
"that's a challenging wank" RIP.
god rest this man he was amazing and whoever disliked this video has no soul God rest you Sean Lock
RIP Sean, one of the best.
When I lived in Shanghai 3 years ago I was going through a hard time with my narcissistic mother and I remember every morning I would be so angry but whilst getting ready to go to Chinese classes I would watch  Cats does Countdown and instantly feel 100% better. Thank you Sean for all the laughs. You will always be a comedy legend.
Rest in peace Sean Lock, your genius will live on. Thank you for the years of belly aching laughter.
He will forever be one of the greatest comedians this country has ever seen extremely funny and not a fame chaser like some others oddly dignified and a pleasure to watch
