That’s technically not on tv. It’s on tinternet
Why was the ref laughing when she hit it?
12 perfect darts 🥵🔥🔥
The crowd went wild 😂😂
Why does it matter if she a woman .9 darter speacial for any dart player.your gender is second .dart player first
This is one sport men and women can play together. Trans people should learn darts lol
Seriously?  Darts televised?
Darts were great the scorer absolute melt .voice was a joke
Not Russ Bray, is he!
Simply stuuuunniiiiinnnng!!!!. 👏🥳🎉   🤩FALLON 😍
That announcer.... how to remove him?
That Caller needs sort his calling out ffs,talk about annoying.
Nine darter while a caller had his head stuck in a fish bowl ,, awesome ,,
This is the best 9 darter ever as she had to beat that annoying voice too 😂
Great darts by Fallon. Terrible ref voice !!!!!!
The Caller is a Pu...
not even the ref wanted to be there what a joke
This clip made me seriously think, what would me calling out a 180 sound like?
Ref is rather melancholy..
I agree with you about ref
Is that Keir Starmer calling the Scores out
If she had hit back-to-back 9-darters then I don’t think there would have been a moment in sports tv history where the magnitude of the occasion had been so out of sync with the environment it took place in.
Terrible announcer and commentator didn't do her justice at all, how on earth did they get their jobs! Awful
Even if I could hit a 180 I would have to  make sure I missed it so I wouldn't have to hear that announcer say 180! That is going to drone in my head all day now, I can't unlisten to it!
Awesome well done Fallon Sherrock  🙂👍
12 perfect darts....and the videos stops?!?! that's almost more disgusting than the guy on the microphone...
The woman is fallon sherrick, british player.
Sounds like this caller hasn’t hit puberty yet
Calm down on the celebrations, Fallon.
Luke did it at age 14.
Brilliant 👍👍
Sounds like he is doing the Muslim call to payer when saying 180.
vyzeras ako vajcnerka
Warum sollte eine Frau das nicht können ich gratuliere ihr
Looks like the worst darts venue ever.  The caller couldn’t sound less interested!  Imagine him with his girlfriend ….. “oh yes, oh yes, give it to me baby”!  The girl could have crawled off before he’d finished and he’d be none the wiser!!!!
Who the F*ck is that poxy commentator with a womans soppy voice...
The ref is almost like he was depressed  doing this job 😂
Luke Littler.. Have you seen this?? No pressure 😅.. just kidding!
That man’s calling voice 🤮
Where is the Audience?
Did the referee book a day off school?
The guy on the Mike sounds as enthusiastic as reverent Lovejoy on the Sampson’s
I think there was an old couple sitting in the back falling asleep
She’s a big ole bubble now😂
God it’s bleak without a crowd innit.
Wow, such poor commentating and announcing for such a historic moment. 😂😂😂
Most depressing ref ever
Caller needs to calm down a bit, almost gave himself a heart attack with his over-enthusiasm.
The calling of the 180's did it for me. 😂😂😂
Who is the mupet called a referee 😮😢❤❤🎉🎉
One hundred and eightyyyyy! 😂😂
The Choir wants the referee back.
Who the fk is the caller? Never heard anything like it.
Such a shame it wasn't in a competition live on television.
How underwhelming for her. A pathetic score caller for an amazing leg of darts.
WTF is that 180ty sounds like a muppet
Is the ref mentally ill ?
Is this a skit? No audience, referee sounds suicidal,
How can he call the scores? Awful, and for such a moment!
That guy one hundred and eiiighy. Just the worst darts announcer ever
Terrible ref and awful commentary
The referee is horrible
Why is there nobody ?
I could not listen to that referee for long, he was limp wristed in his calling 180.
You can sort of forgive the referee losing himself when she checked out so beautifully  because he saw magic happen before his eyes, the way he calls numbers was not so understandable.
Don't know who's wore the score announcer of the commentator .
My ears are bleeding with that clown.
And she was on blob at the time,  Amazing!
That ref needs a Snickers or something
Great nine darter, but that dill brain calling out the scores, needs banishing to the Canadian frozen tundra.
Worst mcs ever🤦‍♂️
A score caller sounding like a friend who's doing a p1sstake of a proper dart caller and a commentator who sounds like... well, let's just say they didn't stretch the budget on this section of the tournament😂
Poor woman deserved a better announcer and a full live audience
If it was me, I'd be jumping around the room with sheer delight. But Fallon just takes it in her stride. What a mighty woman !
I shagged fallon on a backpool pier in 2021
"They can hear us, Sid. we're quite close to the stage."
❤❤❤
great finish , shame about the ref !
best watched with mute on.
Stooop screamingg
Brilliant achievement. Flat Covid atmosphere spoils it a little, not lifted at all by that awful score caller.....
Sack that ref
The first darts tournament with a background singer I've seen so far.
No
No
....and loosely throwing three extra perfect darts after it
I thought that Stacy Bromberg got the first 9 darter by a female player in 1994,  they never had social media or so many little channels showing darts as they do these days.
Good for her!
Why does the scorer sound bored?
Must be trans...?
The ref is terrible......
It's a never miss robot for sure?!
She'd Definitely give me a flogging in darts!! That's for sure NICE..
I like this
Well done! Quality darts.
Never let the inflection of your voice go down at the the end of calling 180. Tony Green would be turning in his Bullseye proverbial.
And there's nobody there to cheer 😔
Jesus!! That is perfect arrows ❤❤
The person shouting the scores is a total b******d.
Hits a 9 darter and starts off the next leg with a 180! Crazy stuff!
Seem like an AI Production
Is he mocking her? Singing the score that.
….and the crowd went wild!
An excitement training package for the bland, boring caller please.
Who the hell is the ref sounds like AI
Damn.
Did they just get a passer by to call this ?  😮
The commentator sounded like they were at The Grand National.
I kinda feel sorry for her, getting that perfect 9, with that referee and no crowd. Feel like someone should edit this and stick an audience in. How its meant to sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Cfj5Q2MQE
It looks like a giveaway game.
Incredible achievement 😎
What the fucks wrong with that referee
Loads of atmosphere exited referee.  Brilliant 😂😂😂
Where did they get the announcer for this one usually when they say 180 it sounds like there are squeezing out a turd the size of a watermelon.
you think that easy?
hope they sacked the caller that was vile
There's a referee that just soooo does not want to be there...... awful too!!! Thank god a crowd wasn't there to witness that!!!
Yer but nobody see it as it wasn’t on main tv
Quality!
The standard of darts has increased phenomenally over the years since I was a young 'un, but by God the atmosphere has been lost to the annals of time.
She needs to get with Luke Littler! Imagine how good there child would be
Get rid of the awful referee
Wonderful to see, lovely darts. Definitely need a new caller on the scores.
Tony Green and Sid Waddell would have made it much more exciting.
"Fallon Shewwock"
The guy calling it sounds like he got molested
booooooooooooooring
Horrendous caller, get down the labour exchange....... I'd to turn the sound off!
Great 9 darter! Only spoiled by the horrific voice tone of the referee 🤬🤬🤬
That would have lifted the roof of Alexander Palace 12 perfect darts
Who employed the announcer because they both need to lose their job never heard someone make a 180 sound so boring
He should stick to working in the bingo halls but doubt people would hear their numbers been yelled at the back end of the room
_"one huuunnnndred and eigHhhtTtteEEeee"_
WOW 😮👍
what terrible commentary
This is click bait 😅😂😅... this didn't happen. How easily it is take you all in. This wasn't a televised event. No cowds, no announcers and a commentator on crack 😅😂😅
That is one bizarre and God awful 180……! Weird!
Ref nearly swallowed  mic 🎤
Well done Fallon, superb.
The first person to call 180 like this was a legend.  The others are pretenders.  This guy is a twat.
Sounds like she won the previous leg, so at least 13 perfect darts, possibly more, depending on how she checked out. What's the record number of perfect darts by any player?
This referee is fucking killing me does anyone know his name? 😂
Darts and snooker - why are these sports not open at the top to both sexes in the same competition? What possible advantage is there to being male?
No atmosphere whatsoever
Oha, stange reaction. To cool :-) This was a perfect leg. Come on: Go crazy! and... the referee sounds really stange
"Oneeeee-Hunnnnndred annnnnnd-..........80" Oh my Days i wanted to punch myself in the head listening to him. Needs more work.
I like the refs 180 tbh
This standard of darts deserves a beered-up capacity crowd, and a score-caller like Russ Bray. This berk was truly terrible.
🦋🦋 Beautiful lady, Very annoying guy 🦋🦋
When she throw a 9 darter in front of cameras she throw for sure more than a dozen in practice
Stop these Sherrock jokes! There's even no darts fallon the floor
I mean, who else would it have been but her to do it?
Awesome
Someone have a word with the ref
I really wish darts announcers would just announce. This guy sounds stupid.  The guy in the PDC worlds this year shouting “Onnnnnnnnnnnne blbrbkrbdlbmrmrllrmdbmlrm an eiiiiiiiiiiiitrmllylrly was just ridiculous”.
OoooooooooonehuuuuuuundredandEEEEEEEEEEEEighttttyyyyy ....... <depressed dog face>
the referee LMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the guy threw a good leg as well so she was under pressure the whole time. the guy on the microphone was a shambles though.
He obviously didnt attend  calling  school 😢😢😢
Not sure what was more impressive,  the 9 darter or the coolness to score a maximum directly afterwards.
I've noticed all big competition refs have weird voices, same in the world championship he needed a good old gargle 🤔
Gosh that was an underwhelming experience 😅
With her relaxed attitude you would never think she is a very good dart player
Darts is a lot less exciting without the crowd. Even the referee sounds weird without the background noise. Either way this is awesome and she did it so cooly, it's just such a shame that there wasn"t a crowd to boost her after that!
That a toss csller 😂 Fallon is no looker but a ok lady player....bombed this time at Ally pally
It’s like something from a Smith & Jones sketch (for those that remember Alas Smith & Jones). A shame for Fallon who achieved something very special but has somehow been overshadowed by an idiot🤪
Sounded like stephen hawking was calling out the scores🤫
Absolutely awful voice of ref, no charisma at all.
Garden shed challenge with drunk scorer?
Why didn't they have an audience?
0:20
The 180 in the next leg to start off 🎉fablous 👏🏼 👏🏼
Sorry, so distracted by that scorers ridiculous voice.
I love her
Wow the crowd are so stunned they’re speechless.
Then home to cook her bloke his dinner
the caller should be fired...
oneee hunred and aaaaightea
Sack that ref
Commentator and ref need to find other employment somewhere!!!
Yeah great crowd....what an atmosphere!🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣🤣
Probably one of the only games where gender is irrelevant. It shouldn't be classed as sport.
Ref needs to fix his auto-tune, holy shit.
What a horrible voice that lad has. And the voice over from the commentator is shite as well. Sounds like two kids whose balls have not dropped. ffs
If there had been a crowd here, the ROOF would have come off.
This needs an audience, just to drawn-out the referee. BLOODY HORRIBLE. "Nuff Said "
bro i watched ONE dart video and now that's all the algo sends me and i can't stop watching them and i have zero clue about darts other than bullseye good
awsome   well done fallon ??? but   that guy  has to go  he has to be the worst comintater ever ???
this video is a lot better if you mute the sound. commentator and referee both painful to listen to.
He sounds like a bingo caller in the local social club.
Can't believe her awful luck to hit a 9 darter with the worst commentator and referee combo in living memory
Big deal. About a million men have already done it.
Why do these scorers have to fuck about saying 180 or any score above 100 …. They sound fecking stupid
Is the referee drunk?
GOAT
Congratulations but my goodness how underwhelming. Terrible referee and 0 audience.
The caller is trying to sing
I wanna hear this ref say "gooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll" after a Brazilian nobody scores a tap-in.
ref just doesnt care lmao
Why is this like a school play reenactment of a darts match
Why this guy screaming like a little girl? Alse the madame that calls the score!
Is she pregnant?
Terrible caller haahahaha
Who is the te IDIOT shouting the score ? Bet a person doing drag queen storytime in a library could do a far better job.
When you get 180 but your parents are in bed
Deserved a far, far better commentary.  This guy can't spake.
fact she went straight off with a 180 after is pretty class
the commentary is golden hahahah
What a great achievement!! All i could focus on was that incredibly annoying voice, what the hell?
This historic moment.... ruined by not being able to stop laughing
when was the first mens televised 9 darter. cant remember seeing a thing about. its funny its always the women.  fair play to her but if it was a man nothing would be said.
Gotta be the weirdest calling of a significant sporting achievement I’ve ever heard!
Always an incredible feat, but my lord the quietness is very odd.
welcome to club nine darter finish fallon sherrock
12 PERFECT DATES WTF
one hundred and 888888888888tea.. haha wtf is all that about
“WORRRRRRST REF IN THE HIIIIIISOTRYYYYY OF DARRRRRRTSSSSA”
Is the score announcer retarded?
Came for history, stayed for the caller😂
Ref really fumbled lol
The darts caller sounds like he shouls be in phoenix nights 😂
Don't know who the commentator is, but at least he sounds genuinely excited and enthusiastic about the whole thing, unlike the lad who's calling! Shame there's no crowd because if this had been at Ally Pally, someone would've needed to repair the roof!
Nahhh the referee baked af
Ref needs the boot.... useless
Unbelievable.  Silence.  No celebration from her.  Just gets on with the match.
Jesus, that ref sounds like his dog just died and his wife left him
The kind of sport where its even.
Fantastic rivetting commentary
Imagine that clowns voice all the way through your match 😳
One huuundred and gaayytee
The ref ruins it. How did he get the job?
Sack that dart caller, how on earth anyone employs him ? Pathetic 😂 and annoying!
That is the gayest 180 I have ever heard from a ref!
Not even note worthy.
Lack of audience is a scandal.
The ref had one job....
Where were they playing in someones kitchen?
As was RVB saying a 9 darter is incredible but it’s just 1 leg.
Who the fuck is that referee😂😂😂
I hundred and eighty 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 talk about car crashing a moment in history !!🌟bless her 🎉
The way he says 180 is fucking hilarious😂😂
180 forced commentary cringe.
The may be a nine dart 501, but it is not the perfect nine dart. According to Bobby George it is triple twenty, triple nineteen and bull on all three visits.
Worst darts caller ever
I go weak at the knees when I see this girl throwing darts, or even just stood there tbh, she's my dream girl, the fact that she can throw darts is just a bonus. x
Friggin' awesome!!
The caller sounds autotuned
Amazing!!
wow these people know how to party!
I find incredible that the announcer can add the total up so quick anywhere round the board in darts
oooonehundreeetaaandeeeigty *yawn*
Brilliant but ruined by the worst 180 call by the guy next to the board. wtf was that all about. 😂
Outstanding!
Apart from the Darts itself the entire presentation was dire, from caller to commentators
The guy on the mike is having a mere.
Been done by "people" b4
If that caller's intention is to be the worst and most annoying in dart history then he succeeded.
why is it impressive because its womens first theyre no exactly at a disadvantage its darts      shes competing with men against men so cool but pretty mediocre lets not lie
Re the singing of "One hundred and eighty". I believe the next line is "What next is the question". 🎵🎵🤔
ooonnneee hundrreedddd and eeeiiiggghhhhtttyyy. fantastic darts by fallon but that scoring call  is a passion killer.
Brilliant darts, absolutely amazing…..  horrendous calling, made me want to stick forks in my ears. Shame there was no crowd to go wild for her.
Worst caller in history 😩
This girl is on fire dancing 💃🔥
The caller singing the score badly! 😅
wow what a nob of a compare -= really that voice     wow
She's a great player. Not a female. Recognize the person not the sex. You are all morons .
Awesome darts, awful caller!
Televised?????
and the crowd goes wild.
Sack that caller ffs.....
Terrible ref and not having 3000 drunks yelling wrecks the ambiance!
Awesome job well done 👍
ooone huuundred and eeeigh "ty 😇"
Lol “televised” …. Was this on public access tv?!?!
Who is the moron calling the scores. Is he retarded?
Plus she did it while pregnant.
This wasn’t on tv
Was there no crowd, that totally lacked any atmosphere.
The score announcer 😂
And she's easy on the eyes
Amazing arrows, but no atmosphere and a chalker that sounds like he wants to kill himself.
Could do without that idiot announcing the scores
Brilliant. And her opponent was very sporty and he also threw a damn good leg.
So papa Smurf is calling darts now.
Jaaz, that lads voice and intonation isn't suited to darts is it?
She totally looks like Ursula Ditkovich. "If promises were darts, my daughter would throw a perfect leg!"
The ref sounds as if he can't be bothered.
Id say with a crowd she might not of done it . Too much distraction .
Shocking commentary.
Fallon shewock
and the crowd went wild ...
the guy doing the scores is rubbish, no enthusiasm
Not 100% sure but did she not hit a 9 darter a couple of weeks before this in a competition,but there was no cameras present ?
The caller didn't know what planet he was on when Fallon took out the 141
Darts is often called a "Sport".....it`s no more a sport than fishing,they are both Hobbies/Pastimes.
Where were all the spectators??!! There should’ve been a crowd to cheer her for that one!! It was hardly in the middle of COVID, as they didn’t have masks on.
And the crowd goes mild
Ffs the caller was so quiet calling the 180's out
What lame '180' BY THE COMMENTATOR.
Just made it look easy unbelievable
The scorers voice, is that for real..
Worst caller in darts history.😢
whats the go with the guy or what ever it is ,doing the scores like a gay guy.
Congrats, Darts goddess!!
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!!!!! 🎯😍🤩😇🥳👏🎯
The guy calling the 180 needs to wake up a bit sent me to sleep 😴
That bloody voice of the marker.... omg one huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuunndred n eighttttttttttttttttteeeeeeeyyyyy fgs just say it normally muppet
Fuckin Amazing…what perfection!
Fallon the best.
WOW 👍 👍 👍
Guy with the mike is in the wrong job....THAT is not a voice for darts..!!
Awesome darts 🎯
Can someone please give the caller elocution lessons. He has the most annoying voice.
There are not enough superlatives to describe just how good Fallon is.
Why does the guy calling the score sing the score? lol
Well, all I can say is WHAT A BORING SCORER.
Meh, no crowd.
That caller was a fucking disgrace, get his ass outta there, imagine stepping in front of the player who's just done a niner to fucking check??  The guys voice sounded like a child trying to impersonate an adult.
No reason on earth women can't compete on an equal footing with men in darts, so have at it 👍
Wow, absolutely fantastic!! What a shame there didn't seem to be an audience there to react, and a monotone commentator.
she thinks that she needs "pressure" to function, if only she could harness her skill more easily without the bs...she's much better than she thinks she is.  She needs a good sports psychologist
Get that bloke off the mic.  Probably a lovely chap but the voice!!!
Would love to see her do it on world stage against Price
Who was the score caller boring knob jockey 😂
Pity there’s no crowd. Place would have gone bonkers!
That deserved a bigger stage than that.
That score announcer is depressing.
Bloody brilliant
Thank god Fallon played this 9-darter in an empty arena, otherwise I believe the dead-drunk crowd (as they usually are at a Darts event 🤦) who always massively boo any opponent of Fallon's would've gone completely berserk
Feminine beauty and skill combined!
Very nice. Just sad that there was no crowd to watch it all. 😅
She is amazing!
That scorer needs sacking, he could bore paint to sleep..
Who cares
👏👏👏👏👏 But sack the caller 🙄😂
The scorers voice is the most annoying thing ever......
Referee needs to find another pastime
writes history takes a sip of water what?
39 years after the great John Lowe did it.
Someone did something with darts while rocking a vagina.
This was not televised was it?
😮 12 awesome Darts 👏👏👏 but sorry uhm 🤔 referee Sound like falling asleep 🙈🤭😅
It's not a strength sport so women should compete on a level field.
If Russ Bray was commentating here, would have been most epic
Are you sure that commentator isn’t Chris Packham ?
Who would have thought darts would be the poster sport for gender equality😂, funny how some talk and force shit but darts just quietly walks the walk.
Did she actually win the match?
Why have 54 dickheads given this a thumbs down? Haters gotta hate, idiots
Nice one Fallon! Huge milestone for the ladies
What a force to be reckoned with this woman is certainly a trailblazer keep going Fallon
The commentator sounds like Chris Packham
Regardless of who you are , a nine darter is a magnificent feat.
It really was a great shame that there was no crowd there to witness the great achievement but kudos to fallon sherrock anyway 😁
That caller is soooo annoying.
Fallon SHErrock da Female Phil Taylor of Women's Darts!! Feel Her POWER!!
Exactly! Women's sports need to be cancelled. Women can beat men. Fallon Sherrock "Makes History". Yes!
Such a shame she didn't do this in a full arena. The noise would have been earshattering
Gotta love how everybody's all shocked about it... except Fallon. Her opponent is trying to congratulate her on the milestone, and she's like "yeah, your turn". That's some confidence.
On Television?! About five people watch this channel
Whatssss wronggggg with thatttt calluurrrrrrr..he wants to make noise but nothing comes out
The scorer is desperate to call on the big stage but sounds like a wet can of piss
That dude is pretty good.
just brilliant - go girl
Your shite and you know you are . Went backwards in your career lol
Imagine at ally..
Referee has very soft voice and also pretty silent.
WTF was the IDIOT on the Mic ??
What a boring  marker?
No shit Sherrock...!?
"MAKING HISTORY" again? ))) Yes, she did beat two men at the World Championships three years ago, which is still not a significant achievement among men. However, nothing else has changed since then. Women continue to be eliminated in the first round, as always. Including Fallon Sherlock So what kind of “story” is she creating? Human biology “makes history” and no -insane- “progressive” prejudices can contradict it.
the celebration was rather dull
At 10 min she still has 180... a legend says, she could not get rid of the 180 till today... poor girl😮
What a babe
(:
calling 180 like that should be banned
Horrible announcers.
That Score Announcers voice is horrible.. o.O
Such a shame this wasn't in front of a live audience!
Amazing how she did it with the numpty on the mic whining out her scores
She is so humble... Love it! 😋
Fantastic Fallon!  🙌
That ref is in pain. Tell him to take out the but plug
Too bad there wasn't a live crowd.they woulda went fkn nuts👍
Shame it wasn't infront of spectators,  it would have raised the roof off
Fallon is the queen of darts... what a magnificent 9 darter. Well done and congratulations sweetheart.🎉❤
Who is the appalling commentator???
Oooonnnnneeeeee hhhhhuuuuuuunnnnnnddddddreeeeeed and Eeeiiiiiiigggggggggtttttyyyyyyyyy👍
She deserved a crowd.... At least a hug....
That caller is awful
Ich gönne es ihr so hart ey ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a shame this wasn’t in front of a huge crowd!
When they fist bumped, the size difference of their hands lol
Super cool. But that referee must have the least inspired ’180’ call in darts history
dont shout as good as they used to , weak
That guy on the microphone calling the 180s needs some excitement in his life 😂
where they find the gimp on the mic
This is what happens when the women start playing with the men, they improve dramatically. If you want to be the best, you have to play against the best.   I hope to see more women competing in sports like darts, snooker etc where men don't have a speed or strength advantage.
Get in there! Go girl. Were is the bloody crowd??
Phenomenal darts from fallon………….but that commentary 😂😂😂
Insane!
Change the caller!!! Sounds a right numpty!🙉👎👎🤦🏻‍♂️
let's bang the caller....🤮
Did she win this match?
Brilliant game! And get rid of the referee... he sounds like he's suffering from brain damage.
How annoying is the announcer!
Is Mark Goldbridge commentating? 😅
Not being funny but if she was a bloke she’d have got a hug from the opponent for 9 darter. Strange world we live in. I digress magic darts 👏👏👏👏👏
Need a new bloke calling out the scores. His 180s were unbelievably underwhelming….he look embarrassed that she got the 180 and the 9 dart finish
Awesome
Amazing!!! Breaking records, boundaries and setting examples! Well done, I hope it inspires a lot of young female players to go on playing and wish you lots of success out there!
Why you dont let her shot another 9darter
She is so superb❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm so glad I saw that ! Congratulations to her ! Only wish it had been on a 'big' stage in front of a huge crowd.
Brilliant Darts....but what an awful scorer. Sounds like he's singing '1 hundred & eighty'....where did they drag him up from??? Xx😂xX
Happy for her. We always knew she had this level of ability, that's never been her problem.
Apparently her next score was 7. 🙂
Fantastic, Well done Fallon
Omg what’s happened to the commentators of darts….?  Dreadful
Cool
She deserved a man hug after that.....ooh, controversial. Seriously though, she is amazing and can't believe that you don't really hear stuff about her on mainstream. She is an absolute inspiration!!!!!!!
That score callers voice is bloody disgusting..😠😠! But she threw really well getting the 9 dart finish..👍👏👏
Fallon you’re so cool and awesome you Fallon. Nine darter 180, that is awesome cool, excellent superb, Fallon and that is a massive understatement.,  Hope you went on to win the game
Who the fuck is the person singing the results? Just why? It makes me cringe. Is it to satisfy some woke agenda to have a non-masculine voice say the results?
Brilliant for Fallon, but this special occasion was ruined by the worst calling I have ever heard!
Sack the ref...dreadful voice
Fucking brilliant fare play to her 👍🙂
how shit is this score announcer? sounds like frodo from lord of the rings. give it some welly like in the 80's
What’s going on with the caller’s  voice
FTLOG ... Take the microphones away from those guys.
❤❤❤
Good darts
Magic, well done.
Bet she gets paid the same as the men. Good arrows.
Ref needs a beer, sounds like he's calling the bingo.
She should have saved that for the crowds.
Shame it wasn't infront of a big crowd. I have thrown a billion darts at a dartboard and NEVER scored a 180.  Amaizing to throw 12 perfect darts in a row like that. Also ..... the worst score caller I have ever heard.  He should work for British Rail.
Yeah but..Can she bake a cake?
Where are the fans?
Well done Fallon - but hey - please up your game the scorer - what a terrible voice score call!
Was there any audience there?  That totally lacked any atmosphere which is disappointing.
Bravo and congrats Fallon, could not be happier for you. A stellar achievement that I hope spurs you on to even more tournament successes.
why have the caller do that ? in an empty room ? embarrassing
That announcer thinks his delivery is great .. trust me its shite
I remember John Lowe doing it back in the day and earning a fortune for doing  so...all she got was a fist bump !
That scorer has the most annoying voice
Lipscome throws like his whole family just died
Brilliant playing by Fallon Sherrock. Where's the crowd though? That would've been pure electricity with spectators. Also, why does the scorekeeper sound like someone's giving him a wedgie when he tells the score? Then, the summit of his achievement, Fallon pretty much has to tell him rhat she's won that game. For me, a shame that such a great moment in darts had no live audience - especially as the two players had such respect and sportsmanship between them. Though i don't think wedgie boy the scorekeeper would've lasted 5 seconds in front of a live crowd :-)
Such an inspiration for all female dart players.
Is the caller on valium?
Another milestone for Fallon. Not just a perfect game... but 12 perfect darts.  Wishing the very best for her.
Mad skills
The queen of darts
Fair play to her,just another day at the office👍🍺
can we get some new callers lol
What the hell is the scorer drinking
No particular celebration. Just like it was another leg.
But wait a minute..... the atmosphere in the room was just.....non existent!
Fantastic performance 👏👏. It's a shame there was no crowd in the background to witness it apart from it been shown on TV.
The marker made an meal of the nine-darter 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
eZ
great stuff
Superb! 👍
Wow impressive babe👌👍
I've never heard a 'one hundred and eighty' said in such a depressing manner.   Perhaps someone needs to get him some red pop.
Top dart throwing is that girl, 👌🥇well done.
Massive respect ❤️ but why does the fella with the mic have to sound like a complete moron ?
I love how humble she is afterwards.. Awesome..
She averaged over 170 for those 15 darts!
Well done Fallon brilliant darts
awesome
What on earth is the caller doing? There is no audience, who is he talking to when he says 180 as if it’s a full auditorium?
I believe Media think, women are disabled persons...its History If they can also throw a 9 darter.
Is this being played in someone's garage ?
That was brilliant. Well done, Fallon. History-maker!
Fantastic 9 darter, but no crowd, and the commenter and ref sound like weirdos
Wow, Fallon Sherrock should get a Gold Trophy for that 9 darter 🙂
Brilliant darts
What a Woman !!!
Well done., but that ref needs some serious voice training..
Good on ya fallon u go girl
Wow! Incredible throwing. Thank you for downloading this.
My fave female player.Brilliant 9 darter 👍
Yeeha , excellent stuff Fallon.
Wwwwooooowwwwww!!!    Absolutely fantastic, just wish I was that good. Well done. 😊😊
wo......
Outstanding darts. Huge congratulations to Fallon.
Shame that caller made it and awful video to watch.
That commentator is mind numbingly boring his voice drives me nuts.
She is a star...😍
I used to watch darts and snooker all the time but it then became the same old boring things to watch 9 dart finishes or 147s
Christ, i can call better than this dude. Im welsh and i do it in the old cockney accent that they used to have in the lakeside matches back in thr 80s & 90s....such a momentous moment ruined by no crowd & a dismal shouter! 😢
Amazing! Congratulation! What an incredible role model for everyone in this sport!
The noise by the crowd is Deafening😂😂😂
adams look into the camera was a "sh...imma lose to a girl" 😂😂
Why was there no crowd at this event? please don't anyone say COVID 😡
1:34 1:34
That bloke giving out the scores is bloody annoying.
congrats's - great to see !!
THE MORON singing the score !!!!! with out a doubt biggest twit ive heard and seen in years
Hope that shouter doesn’t make the premier league
Not the same without 5000 drunk people losing their minds and tossing full drinks into the air
Well done👍
$wagzilla 🦖
If there was a crowd, they would of gone crazy! I would of.
Who's the freak calling the scores?
You can’t argue with perfection. Pretty good leg for Adam Lipscombe too as any mistakes from Fallon and he would have been favourite on 101.
No disrespect but my wife beats me at darts often it's one of the few things we're men don't have a physical advantage over women.
Nice one
Imagine if this was in front of a live crowd. They would've ripped the roof off !
Imagine the crowd response if this had a live audience
Gutted this wasnt at the ally pally
That referee would be a class act calling out bingo numbers, by the time he finished there would just be a room full of skeletons zzzzzzz
Did referee Justin Bradshaw say shit before shot? LOL
Who the scobby doo is that Ref, jeez that was hard work.🙄
The caller was so motivated - don't be tired at 180 scores
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! Congratulations Fallon!!!! Such a great role model for our sport! Brilliant!!!!!!
Wow incredible 👏
💤
CONGRATULATIONS <3
Brilliant she's a class player 👍👍👍
The referee sounded absolutely awful!!
Announcer has the worst version of one hundred and eighty I've ever heard
Perfect👏👏👏👍👍👍👌👌👌👌
Darts is definitely a sport where genders shouldn't be split.
Mate she is sharpe
Why the soft speaking "180"?  Doesn't sound like the guy on British darts back when I played.  He would yell it resoundingly 180!
What did she win ???
Odd comentty. Almost singing 😅
Where was the crowd????
Good lass!❤❤❤
this better shut the haters up. this proves to me she is an amazing player, not to mention her other accomplishments...she has hit 2 9 darters and this was 12 PERFECT DARTS!!
That scorer is the worst I've ever heard.
Arrows!!
Not televised it means nothing without an audience
Holy f*** this lady is dam good 👍🏿
Stunning.
👏👏👏👏
Wankest atmosphere, score caller and commentator ever. Such a big moment marred by a cruddy surrounding. Imagine this in PDC
180,that voice.😀
Surely she gets a tour car next year? 😏
Referee is worth listening to 😂😂
BRILLIANT.. Great Arrows. Go Get Em Girl
Good darts,that guys voice is shite fairplay
Fallon doing what Beau cant😮
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
More 180's in 1.34 than I've hit in 2 year! Great to watch.
That's got to be the worst saying of 180 by the referee 😂
😴😴😴
wow amazing what a girl
I shown her how do that
Always said there is something so so sexy about Fallon. Bet she is utter filth too.
Without a crowd darts becomes completely pointless
A very elite group now with John Lowe...well done Fallon👏👏👏
I'm going to sign up for a webcam darts league so I can claim a "televised win" 😂
Very awesome from Fallon
YES great
Congratulations!!!!!!!
No need to shout!!!
The scorer sure calls it with enthusiasm ........... Not !
Hats off. That was brilliant darts❤
Fallon rocks ✌️😇❤️
And the crowd goes Mild
Absolutely unbelievable i can't speak i can't speak!!!!!!  Now is it her time to win the whole thing on Saturday night cmon Fallon you go girl!
Hopefully she can hit one at the world champs in December
Plenty of enthusiasm from that ref 😂
Hardly televised
Absolutely fantastic Fallon! You are amazing!
Many many many CONGRATULATIONS ... simply the best ... so professional in her manner ... the caller / scorer was more overjoyed than Fallon ... great performance.
Probably get given a place in the world championships for that
Can you turn comments on again
Did she win the match ?
She is awesome!!!
And the crowd goes absolutely bonkers. She has broken the glass ceiling yet again 🎯
Wow
Absolutely incredible! Go on, Fallon!!
Darts don't lie, the girl is a beast.
i never thought a lady would do it live on camera, wow she has got bottle!!
Whoever was operating the magnets behind the board did a great job
She is only getting better and better
Absolutely fantastic darts from Fallon 👍🏻🎯
it's no coincidence, it's already the second time she has played 9 darts! #FallonN1 🎯💪
Amazing! It's hard enough to hit a 180! Well done Fallon!
Amazing!! Shame there was no crowd to go crazy.
Damn, 12 perfect darts!!

This was also a highly "necessary" 9-darter, both within the leg and match as a whole.   A lot of 9-darters occur when the opponent isn't on a finish, and thus, there would have been no difference if it was 10-12 darts or more likely, even 13-15 darts. In this case, it was a break of throw when Adam Lipscombe had been scoring very well, and was on 101 after just 9 darts himself, a highly makeable out.   Moreover, a lot of 9-darters occur when one opponent is significantly ahead, not affecting the outcome of a match. In this case, Lipscombe was ahead 3-2 in a first to 4, throwing for the match. Without that 9-darter, Sherrock loses the match, while with it, she ties the score and throws for the match herself.
🎶Game changer, history maker..🎵🎶 advert.. ..Toyo Tyres..
Really brilliant stuff cause after she hit that she started with 180 in the follow decider 👍
The caller needs to go back to school.... Absolutely terrible.  Great job Fallon!
"Game- shiiiihehe Shot.. And the ...  I can't spake.."
Wow!
Nice!
Nicely done Fallon
Haha the referee didn’t know what planet he was on when Fallon hit the D12 🤣🤣🤣🎯
She's just bloomin marvelous.
Not just a nine but 12 perfect darts. Phenomenal 👏👏👏  Modus Super Series fast becoming my go-to dart viewing fix: Fresh faces,  short, competitive games, no booing or whistling & quality darts from the likes of Sherrock & Pilgrim. Whats not to like?
End off the day nobody cares what women do in sport it’s not interesting at all
So amazing! She's simply the best❤
brill,good to see this up on youtube so quickly.
Damn, that girl can play 😳🔥❤️
Referee completely lost it 😂
This commentary is awful
Bloody brilliant lass 🎉🎉
Pure 🔥
Then kicks off the next leg 180. Very nice darts indeed
Doesn’t count if there’s no crowd .   Anyone can hit a 180 in their bedroom !!
holy cow henry....calm down
Just casually throwing another 180 after the 9 darter 😂
And a 180 at the start of the next leg...nice
HISTORY MAKER
