MUS-tash? In Dublin we've always said mus-TASH.
Honestly I felt he looked like a grumpy math teacher who all his students hate. Maybe that's because all math teachers should have become used car salesmen.
I need that..😂
Rabbi! Hahahahaha 😂
In the US, a mustache denotes a truck driver.
Foil got it wrong. Arms is a natural newsreader! 😅
🌀
The end was funny, bravo 😅😅
I'm surprised that the councellor did not recommend for the man to become a a Adult Film Actor... (you know, with the mustache and all....)
He is right.
Lol “ my ex wife”
The interviewer’s diploma in the background shows he is legit at personnel assessment. I’m convinced.
He could settle for a Fake German Pop Singer with weird Europop songs about a Ding Dong. Oh you touched my Tralala mm my Ding Ding Dong. And yes it's also based on the Mustache.
Jobs according to type of mustache. Im going to search that on google now.
I'M HOLLERING
I love Arms's mustache
He should have said yes to the Civil Service job, I know three people in it and as far as I can tell all you do is work from home most days, talk shit about your coworkers to your boss who also hates everybody and probably talks shit about you, and then you get a pension. Honestly, my ideal job
This is how the career advisor found his job, it’s a continuous cycle of career advisors
The Ryan Air customer service had me in stitches 😂
This is probably inspired by a classic Monty Phyton sketch right? And I might be reading too much into it but probably the lumberjack was a reference to one of their most classical sketches (Dead Parrot followed by the Lumberjack song).  Anyway well done, I loved it!
He (career advisor) is not wrong. The mustache does define the job. We need to have the courage to admit what our facial hair makes us. Stand tall, be proud of your stache! Embrace your Bristle Baton and let it guide you to a glorious and fulfilling future!  P.S. with that lip foliage the inquisitor could also be a YouTube comedian. Na, never mind no one would fall for that. Stick with a BB coach or a used car salesman.
« That’s it, I’m leaving! » - « My ex-wife! » classic 😂
ryan air customer service😂😂
It is cute, but now go shave 🪒 it. You are too cute for that. 👍👍😍
Just love this great greetings from the Netherlands
Gaurda also
He could be a woodwork teacher.
That guy in blue shirt  looks exactly like Murray Hewitt😂
I was a dam inspector for the federal government. There was no dress code or appearance requirements, but I can attest all of us from technicians to Ph D engineers looked the same & dresses the same. Mustache or beard not required, but everyone had one. Looking back, it is funny. Also, we all carried a huge Keychain on our belts because we each needed about 15 different keys to get thru all the gates we went thru. It was common at the time, but I rarely see men with a monster bunch of keys on their belt today.
I don't understand the "ex wife" thing....could someone explain? Thanks. Otherwise great video!
How bout another show in LA?
"It's the mustache". Yep, I knew it right away.
"This conversation.... is over!" "--> RYAN AIR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"
All of his suggestions were oddly appropriate
I'm going to be honest, I looked at him and literally thought that he should be a used cars salesman
01:45 "They're mustache jobs." 🤣
These guys should go into comedy
As a priest, look, black shirts do no dandruff favours...
I grew a beard and now I’m a hipster lumberjack. Worked a treat.
Alternative Ending:  I want to talk to your manager!  Karen 👉🏽
Why not a lion tamer?😎
Why did he say his ex wife when the interviewee clearly told him drop the mustache
hvh
what about manager at a cinnabon
1:27 was a headshot!
The last line though... 🤣
Okay, so if you were to grow a beard, that would open some doors for you... 🤣
The he repeats Rabbi for added emphasis and then sits back in awe of his own suggestion at 1:55 is just gold 😂
“I wanted to work with children, you know? Teaching.”  “Whooooa. Not with that mustache…”  (When you catch it) 😂
“I don’t have time for this.”  -Civil Service “I’m leaving.” -My ex wife!  Foil, Arms, & Hog is why we need a ❤️ button on YT for truly great vids.
You lads are always hysterical!!! But, as a US American, your total funniest ever was the US immigration test!!!
I just about held it together until the Ryanair line. 🤣
The twist was perfect, it instantly killed me.
Sh*t!, just like being back at school.... 🤣
"you have an expensive yet cheap looking shirt" Perfect line xD
what about the policeman? first thing that popped in my head when i saw his facial hair qualifications. or is it no longer moustache careeer path?
How about a moderately well payed sketch comedian?
Is it strange that I find both of them quite hot rather than comedic 😂
'thats it im leaving!' *MY EX WIFE!*
Come to Brasil!!!!!
🥸😀😃😄
Foil, Arms & Hog are truly wonderful.
Machine Learning wants to join the chat
Sure he secretly wanted to be a lion tamer;)
ex wife🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ned flanders had a moustache and he opened  the left handed emporium.   "taxi"
RYNAIR CUSTOMER SERVICE AHHAHAHAHAHA
1:57 My favourite 'Rabbi' joke :  A priest, a vicar and a rabbit walk into a pub. The barman says to the rabbit "Now then sir, what would you like to drink?" The rabbit replies "I dunno, I'm only in this bloody joke because of autocorrect!"
Algorithm comment, excellent video.
“My ex-wife!” I choked on my water.
Arms should totally grow a moustache
I was sure this was headed toward "Adult Entertainment" when I saw the 'tache  :)
😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍
You haven't got any east coast spots lined up. We like a bit o craic down in the mid Atlantic region, you know.
Bank Manager was a good one.
🤣🤣🤣 . I don’t have time for this, , the civil service. It’s literally how they are hello how can you help me today
Firefighter?
I would have told him subway manager
Firefighter or Paramedic. Or Firefighter/Paramedic. Cuz they are mustache jobs.
That's a hair dresser's car lol
*nods head affirmatively*  “They’re mustache jobs.”
Huh. You know my first guess for what career he'd get was a high school math teacher. Maybe a cultural difference. I'd think a used car salesman would have a louder shirt or oilier hair.
And here I was thinking PE Teacher, silly me
I have a crush on Arms. Send help.
"This conversation is over!" "Ryan Air customer service!"
I have glasses, i like wearing flannel shirts even though i'm not Canadian, i walk around in skate shoes and my dressing style didn't change since i was 14...  ...anyone surprised i ended up doing mechanical engineering!?
I want a moustache but with a big nose it does not fit.
Sometimes I think corporate bosses promote people based on how they dress and carry themselves.
Redo it but Mustacheman shaves it off during the interview. Leaving a charley Chaplin mustache by accident. getting Recommended Dictator of Germany
Omg I looked at the thumbnail and I thought car sales. Great job!
Supermarket manager, yes!
Does it remind you of Monty Python’s “Vocation Guidance Chancellor” sketch just a slight bit?
Facial hair does choose a man's profession, very sad. (* ᴗ ᴗ)
Didn't took the bank manager, now that's on him.
mustache jobs
Autoplay is on and after that what youtube offers to listen while I paint my kitchen walls.🙂
The blonde guy looks like someone you find at a pub and he says he can get you any job you wanted. Just drunkily pressuring you into taking his advice. Sooo, wrong setting, but great appearance.
"Ex wife" is a job?"
Alternate title when you look like Pablo Escobar.
choose ex wife, you will get paid alimony for nothing only some women require it not all and not that much
man child
"The good math teacher at a public school" is the first thing that came to my mind
lol this was great
every used car salesman i've ever met has been an emotionally stunted ego-freak
"you've tried it your way!" 😂😂😂😂😭 So true
Isn't it just simpler to shave you moustache instead of continuing ask people to forget it ? And please CAN YOU JUST STOP READING MY COMMENT ?
This sounds oddly much like how I decided to study biomedical laboratory science and go into viral microbiology diagnostics... yup..
Epic.
I was thinking high school janitor...
That stach says cop, or porn star. Or, porn star playing a naughty cop. Just use your imagination
Ryanair customer service. 😂
I look like my job. I look like depression. I am a student.
Basketball coach 🏀 yes haha 😂
Revisiting this after a month. Both times, I sat up straight when Foil said "Your posture is perfect for someone from IT" to Arms.
WAIT! Dandruff shampoo commercial with a priest was also aired in Ireland?
Would you lads be willing to come to Poland on your tour by any chance?
In germany you get less money(or nothing) if you got another worldview.
It was all hilarious... but you ended that one with a hell of a bang!  You guys are great!
With me people would say... Bartender, stripper, hairdresser, store retail.
Moustache jobs 😝😝
"My ex-wife." =D
You did not say a retro por* actor 🤭
I️ think he could be Pedro Pascal if the other careers don't work
“They're moustache jobs!” 😂
"those seem like ridiculous reasons to choose a career" "well you tried it your way and you still ended up in here"  lmao
Great🙂😀😃
"this conversation is over!" "Ryan air customer service!" I lol'd so hard!
Hilarious
take that, mustache!
This conversation is over - Ryanair Customer Service!!! Yes, yes, right on point! Once again a great Sketch! and love how a Masters degree is up on the wall :P :P
Unionize y'all
really funny episode, I like it!
Hipster barber rabbi😂😂🤣
Howling with laughter! The leap from hipster barber to rabbi was pure comedy gold. You're a brilliant bunch!
What if he grew out his hair and wore an eyepatch?
If you ever tried to contact Ryanair support you will not laugh at this 🤣
Am I the only one who is counting the number of times the sketch said moustache 🥸?
I wish you guys were coming to my city!
I would have said Columbian drug lord.
stereotypes
Ryanair Customer Service by far the best
You are purely great, guys! Thank you!!! Keep on like that ❣
Every time I hear a joke about, Ryanair, I mentally replace it with Spirit and realize it all still applies
Thursdays are always a little brighter when I get the notification for one of your videos. Thanks for you hard work. Another brilliant sketch!
Hipster barber or rabbi, he could do both! 🤣🤣🤣
TBH this isn't the worst career advice I've heard XD
Thats hilarious
I must ask you to forget about the facial hair.
“Your handwriting is atrocious, you can make a good doctor” 🤣
Honestly, still better than the normal way
my ex-wife was the best one lmaoo
That reminded me of the hilarious Vocational Guidance Counsellor sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus
You guys are very underrated... 👏👏
LoL :). !!!
Love the UCD cert lads, sure I have one at home in the house myself…
2021? 2022 no?
How many of us are thinking : "pornstar" ?
God bless ya!
This is exactly how the average HR employee works. Only exactly the other way round: with this facial hair you don't fit for this job!
Basketball coach ... yep.
I miss Hog 😢
"Ryanair customer service" - Ouch this is too accurate!
That'll teach me to watch your content when waiting for my anti-wrinkle eye tightener to set....not so perfect eyes lol....😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
does anyone know how long time their shows last?
You forgot p0rnstar
My little one “Mummy please put on the Doom-dah show!”
50+ here and still not sure what I want to do when I grow up so no rush. Great video boys - Love the moustache!
I just booked tickets to your live show in NYC on March 26th. I’m so excited!!!  Love you guys!
So his ex-wife uses a moustache?
So...has he got a mustache or  moustache?
See, I keep telling you that mustaches are a bad idea!
HR Managers wear pashminas
Hey but that mustache 😂🤣
I was thinking accountant from the thumbnail.
My teenage son bought me a ticket for your show in Ottawa for my birthday as a surprise, I'm so thrilled.
You did not mention the most obvious—that is definitely a pornstache he is rocking there.  Glad it was a fun no to working with kids.
Actually, bank manager doesn't sound bad.
Anyone know if Hog's single? He's gorgeous
This is very Friday night dinner/it crowd
"Dress for the job you want."
Says, "It's an investment ". Everyone: "INVESTOR!" *high-fives all around. *bow, exits
Lol
"This conversation is over." "Ryanair customer service!" *smashes guitar in frustration* "Actually, let's put you with United instead."
I thought IT Manager right off the bat! 😁
I thought they retired the doom dahs in 2021.
I’m disappointed. You make your way all the way to Seattle but then don’t actually get to Hawai’i?? We are a part of the USA! COME TO HONOLULU!! ILL BUY YOU DRINKS!!
Dublin is expensive, so one may need to take 2-3 jobs, like lumberjack - hipster barber, and a rabbi on Saturdays.
I’ll give you the basketball coach and others but he doesn’t have enough grease and sweat for the car salesman.
That ending 🤣
Great mustaches in SLC
It's funny that I thought 'car salesman' instantaneously when I saw the 'tache
Love the payoff, the final suggestion
Highlight of our week lads. Our family of five are your biggest fans. Ever tried a sketch on what's going on in a cockpit whilst flying? Yed make great pilots
So many ideas! How could Arms not be content with any of the suggestions? Foil obviously knows what he's doing  Edit: very good use of Arms's diploma again 👍
This was a phenominally written sketch, but you guy talked so fast. I hardly had much time comprehend the jokes let alone appreciate them before you steamrolled into the next one.  Fast paced flying at the edge of your seat speeds don't always make comedy better.
Come to Manchester or roundabout!
Corporal in the army?
That's exciting
"It's much more subtle than that. It's the moustache." Bwaaa haaa! The moustache was the most jarring thing upon opening this vid. Gold!
The one with the hand writting is a stereotype. I'm a resident I'll be having an written exam (like an essay) nextI' week, and I'm actually working on my handwrittin.
Happy 2022! 🥰
My ex wife!
is Arms offering rides on that thing?
Star in Narcos
Geek squad
Great as always, happy new year lads!
100% accurate. Also, my first guess was "Pawnstar", but that would have been too obvious^^
Squatters episode 3?
I miss when Americans made comedy like this.
He just needs a tweed suit and he'd be 110% qualified to sell used cars!
here's a video of Arms other job https://youtu.be/NkJhc6GIRrU
Dandruff? Have you considered a career in the priesthood?🤣🤣🤣
It's Australia and summer and yeah. It's still raining outside. How'd you know lads?
I just wanna know who's degree is it behind foil in the office?
Brilliant! Happy new year guys, I'm looking forward to more of your fantastic skits
Today’s doomdah was especially pleasing to the ear. *chef’s kiss*
Hilarious
But does he have a Lion Tamer hat?
Absolutely hilarious
If he shaves his head he would be perfect as the dictator of Belarus
You're coming to Colorado?! Awesome!!
How much does the ex-wife job pay?
1:19 or instead of a tradesman an editor? It looks like the editor rescheduled the audio sync at 2:16 for a different time :D
Now this one was good! 😁
I want to send you my photo and have you tell me what career I should do!
So, the mustache is gone. I guess he found a job or has given up?
This was gold! XDD I gatta share this with my friends!
I'm surprised that "adult entertainment" didn't come up.  That porn 'stach would have fit in so well!  Very funny.  Thank you!
I checked out your shows in Canada. How on earth are tickets for your Vancouver show $214 plus (the cheapest!! They get even more expensive!) but Toronto is $40 ish and Ottawa is $37 ish! Doesn't make any sense! 😳
I saw the moustache and thought "coffee shop manager" 🤷‍♀️🤣 its clearly a dual purpose look
1:25 hit hard. You tried ityour way and you still ended up in here. 😅
Special treat: I forgot it was Thursday until bedtime..... 😁
I've got my tickets for Toronto in March. Can't wait!! 😀
So good
it‘s a good return on investment.
Awesome way to start the New Year, you guys are brilliant.
Oh im so happy that arms dident grow that thing
so, according to this sketch, Sean Finnegan knows about body language.
I saw the Stache and instantly thought Cop.
The mustache was real? How did he see dandruff on a white shirt? 😆 🤣 that's serious flakeage
Ryanair Ryanair?
Lol 😭😂
😂😂😂
So ex-wife is a job...  is it well paid?
A mustache only suggests one career option for me: porn actor.
Hello that was funny
This one could've been done like those start-up buisness skits
Dammit! No stop in Vegas? I really don't want to have to drive to CA! :)
Leaving school tge only time l went to career advisor, he suggested hairdresser, because of my hairstyle and gender..........
I love how much you hate RyanAir
More of this please! Soo good!! :)
Part 2: Same person, but without the mustache OR different people come in after one another and get one suggestion each or all the same suggestion for different reasons.
thank you for the wonderful videos!
That's painful... "you've tried it your way and you've still ended up here. Let's try something different." That hurt
The last line thrown in there.  "My ex wife!"  Wish it went longer and the advisee could flip it around on the advisor.  Maybe part two is in order next Thursday, eh?
Always heartening to see other UCD graduates doing anything but what we studied for 😂
Guys you never said pornstar. That's a savage pornstache🤣🤣
ugh no tour dates in florida
"You could be a truck driver, or a supermarket manager." "Because they have mustaches." "They're mustache jobs." Loved this part, the delivery seems very Seinfeld-esque.
🤣🤣🤣 This could be a whole series! Please, we need more!
I want to invest in German tour tickets
“You’re handwriting is atrocious you’d make a wonderful doctor” HAHAHSHAHAHA YESSSS
As someone in Ottawa, I'm hoping things are better when you come. Right now, the restrictions in Ontario are pretty strict.
Please go on a Europe tour and come to Switzerland 😍
Good one
That last one just... Brilliant! XD
I was going to buy tickets to the Toronto show, but I live in Buffalo and the COVID test to get into Canada costs $150-$200 😭
I was hoping he would take a face mask out of his pocket and put it on. 😂😂
2:13 "Ryanair customer service" 🤣🤣🤣Killed it😂
My ex wife!
80s porn star
I'll be seeing you when you come to the North East, USA!!! I can't wait!!!
Can’t stop laughing! Best way to start out my Thursday morning here in Canada!😀😀
Do you mean January '22?  Another amazing sketch. Can't wait to see you guys in March!!
See you on November 18th, FAH! Have a healthy, successful, and peaceful New Year!
Hey just to let you know, the times are listed wrong on your website for tour dates (at least for the canadian ones) they don't correct until you click the link and go to the purchasing website. Maybe it's a timezone thing?  eg. Toronto is listed at 4:00 pm
The degree of accuracy in this sketch! Wow 😃😃😃😃 I laughed really loud 😃😃
I've never seen a used car salesman with a moustache, in fact, if we're talking stereotypes, I'd entirely rule out people with moustaches as used care salesmen at all. This man looks more like he'd work in a dead-end office job he hates, like accountancy or processing or something. But, hey, maybe it's an Irish thing.
Funny ... but it completely ignored the fact that all HR personnel are frustrated Lesbians ... and Gay men who want to be frustrated Lesbians ... Just sayin'
I would LOVE to know what career Foil would pick for me.
“My ex-wife!!?!!” 🤣 That, my lads, made me laugh!
Brilliant!
Oh gawd I’m late
#37 on trending! Well done lads!
Wait.. Ryanair has a customer service?
I think my plumber went to this counselor 😄
Another option is a character in a Wes Anderson's movie.
Such great work! I laugh so much all the time!!
Hi
I read “when you like your job” and was expecting to see an office where people discovered that somebody there actually liked working there and were shocked and couldn’t fathom how
A face mask would help a little bit in this case :D
Happy new year lads..enjoyed that one
Growing a moustache for this was dedication 👌🏻
You could be my ex wife 😂😂😂
The rapid-fire jokes in the last 20s or so... 🔥
I just want to know whether the moustache is real. Also I wish a rabbi who looks like that. I wouldn't even mind moustache 😊
He looks so cute with the mustache! 😍
This conversation is over - Ryanair customer service :D  brilliant :D :D
Thanks for making me laugh after a miserable day!
Once again a great Thursday morning laugh!
I was thinking waiter.
Lollll I need to see this guy, careers are hard and it would be awesome to have someone tell me one😂
I am highly in favour of growing facial hair just for a YouTube video 🥸
You pussies coming to Montréal? You know, the place all actors love? Huh? How 'bout now? Now? Ah I hate facial hair, how is that not like kissing 😗 (speaking of) a 🐱?
That moustache is a bookie's moustache. Or a pervert's.
If you want to be promoted to a higher position, you need to have a more commanding mustache first. ;)
🤣🤣🤣
Guys, this is sending me into quarter life crisis hole
Canada's on lockdown. Where is this secret show???
Ryanair Customer service  🤣.
Well done lads. God bless
Mountie.
Anything non manual labour or light manual labour in the construction industry, like: Foreman Machine operator Hardware Store Guy... ...but the hardware stores that trades people go to like T&A* or Builders Providers, instead of ordinary DIY people.  *Yes, T&A is a real construction workers shop, presumably named so a long time before the slang term got popular...or maybe because the slang term got popular???  I doubt it, but I don't know.
Hahaha
dunno, looks like he'd do well in a career  in comedy
plumber, civil service, Ryanair customer service,... so perfect.   BTW Do you still use Ryanair ? Or are you on their black list?
Was January 2021 at the beginning a reference I missed?
US tour dates!!!!!  And you're playing NY the week I'm back in Ireland. Paaaaaiiinnnnn!
Best sketch of the year so far!!!
He has a point.  When you've tried the other job-seeking strategies, it's time to go with something different.
First sketch of the year is an instant banger!
That's a good mustache though.
As someone who just spent a year getting renovations and tons of fixes done, I rly felt that line about tradesmen constantly blowing u off and rescheduling like its not a job they're getting paid for...
Okay, I admit I love the idea of Arms as a rabbi. That I want to see! #futuresketchidea
I love you guys, your humor is on point every single time! Thank you for brighten up every thursday for us. Happy new year!
Were any moustaches harmed in the making of this sketch..😠😂
Brilliant! I wanna watch other versions of this(Foil and Hog version)
Brilliant!
What are the perks of being hired as an ex-wife? Are dental and transportation included?
My ex wife 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait ex-wife?!
Supermarket manager  True
Hilarious! Looks like the degree for an upgraded game as well- very distinguished.
Other jobs  Architect- if he came in with a leather satchel Teacher- if their name is in Irish on their social media
my ex wife video was reused but barely noticeable , great job
I wish you guys a great and successful new year! This is another amazing and clever sketch. Arms’ character will be a great teacher in my opinion with that sadness in his eyes! It’s only the beginning of January - it’s a little early to get depressed. The only depressing thing is that I live too far away to buy tickets for your shows.
Perfect! Used car salesman it is!
We discovered your channel with Quarantine Maths Class and are so excited to have tickets to see you in NYC!
Can we move past the mustache? No, ohhh no 😳🤣
How much does the exwife pay? Does it come with benefits?
It is hard to look past Arm's moustache. It is an unforgettable experience.
Feckin rescheduling tradesmen
"My ex wife"?!?!?! Hilarious, as always! Happy New Year, guys!
soooo accurate !!!! I thank you sooooooooooo much for this kind of sketch !!! I love your work so much ^^ <3 and so much hope you'll be more and more sucessfull !!!!! You so much deserve it!   :D
See you all in wexford, hoping for loads of secondary school irish teacher jokes
"My ex wife" absolutely killed me xD
So still no Perry Florida date? Come on, the gators ain't that big.
Ha ha.
Ryanair costumer service...that one killed me! 🤣
Another excellent video - thanks guys :)
HNY
Definitely potential for adult film star with that 'tache.
Porn actor from the 80s? Sorry, my references are a bit dated ; )
that wife joke at end, priceless xD
Hahaha, needed a laugh. Thanks guys. Been following you for many many years now (when you were just hitting the UK, now look at you 🙌) and seen you live a couple times. Not on Facebook anymore, so nice to keep watching the sketches. Have a wonderful time in the States. We'll see you on the telly-box yet.
How about Persian night-club owner?
I started following your channel in spring of 2021 and you guys helped me during anxiety attacks, haven't regretted subscribing since, keep up the good work, you're doing great !
Nice touch having Arms' real degree in the background! 😄
Great start to 2022! Well done 👏🏼
Substitute teacher as well actually!
This Rabbi approves! I actually grew a beard before my first community position so that I would look older!
Foil must have problems with the corona and masks
I always look forward to Thursdays because of you guys
This feels like the same conversation I used to have down my local Job Centre every fortnight. ☺️  Being serious though, well done lads, hilarious as always.
you guys have beautiful eyes... 😍😍😍😍
Mid 30th and still hadn’t figured it out.  It’s concerning how much I can relate to this. 😳  And hello to a new year with FAH!
What about lion tamer? Or chartered accountant?
question: what car does he drive?
Lads, why have you silenced Hog this way? We missed him  :)
0:00 januari '21? And here i thought it was '22 already
Here we see foil's inner thoughts as he judges everyone's mustache 🤣
Ah this was funny! Golden! 💕
I’d have lost it if you’d have said porn star/director. Haha. Great way to kick off new year lads.
Just the ticket, guys. U have no idea!!!!
"I wanted to work with children, you know. I was thinking maybe teaching." "Oh, no. Not with that mustache, no. Not since the 80s, sadly. If you're wiling to grow a beard, maybe you could be a rabbi?" "Ok, rabbi sounds interesting. I'm not jewish though, or even religious, is that a problem? Although I think a catholic priest would sound more interesting. Wait, did I say that out loud?"
i need to know something what came first, the mustache or the sketch?     Did you make this whole sketch around the fact he had a mustache,  or was it something he pasted on because the sketch was made first
happy new year lads! gave me a lovely chuckle amidst my revision :)
Completely unrelated: It's cracking me up that Arms is tall enough to not be covered by that link-box in the outro, while Hog looks like he's been censored out of the video. Justice for Hog! Hopefully a video starring him is coming up 😊
Car salesman was my second pick after dentist. It's obvious, really.
This must have killed Foil to not play the moustache part 😂
Laughed all the way but what does he mean "ex wife?" My dumb mind couldn't get it.😅
That is one fine moustache you have yourself there! It's time to bring them back to the mainstream, for too long now they have gotten such a bad rep.
I was thinking used car salesman as soon as I saw the thumbnail so maybe it's time to consider a new career, like... career advisor!
Mustache  jobs
I think I am early enough to warrant a like on my post. I have tried and while I may believe in myself, my new year resolution is to be realistic that I will catch your videos on day one, within three hours (lunchtime here) and that should be good enough to warrant a like since I made it!
Guys what about your acts in Germany that you recently mentioned?
Great sketch as always lads! My only new year's resolution is to catch you guys live this year in the UK or Ireland. Good luck on the North America tour!
What about 80's porn star?
"It's January, it's raining, you're miserable." Oh, wow, you know me so well!  Sooo, about my investment in future happiness... Any news on that European tour? Please? 🙏  I wonder who wrote a whole mustache sketch... Foil? But then he'd probably be the one wearing it.  There was a time I used to be mistaken as an employee at the library so many times, I was seriously worried about the way I look. Now it's when I'm buying wool. But there it's actually fun to talk to other customers and give advice and recommend yarn and talk about knitting patterns.  Can Foil use his skills backwards and tell me what I look like, based on this information? 😁  Ps: Happy New Year lads! I really hope 2022 will be a good one for you and you can do your tours without trouble and that I'll still be able to see you each Thursday!
He didn't mention 70's porn star. That surprised me!😁
The only time I kept a moustache was whilst being a traffic officer. Bummed out that you missed that career choice😄
That guy looks like he could play the Mandalorian pretty well
High school careers advisors are even worse
Bombarded with ads? Just felt like I was bombarded with GAGS
Why can't I have some sleep 😭
The ucd diploma behind ya...most useless bit of paper ever 😂😂😂
That Seventies pornstar mustache has to go, Arms! Spoils your pretty face.
As a supermarket employee with a mustache I feel targeted, it's true that it's not the 80's anymore.
Ha ha excellent, happy new year
Dandruff.... Funny cos it's true
"My ex wife" line was amazing
his ex-wife is a career path?
Come back to Germany! We're all boostered and ready to continue having a social life!
Lads... Its Jan'22 😁 Don't think anyone wants to rewind the year....
01:58 oh my gosh your priests also don't wash their hair properly XD  I thought it was just ours because they think men's care products are gay and satanic.
Foil pronouncing the words "looking past the moustache!... That must have been tough 😂I honestly don't know where you lads get your ideas from, so imaginative! This one made me laugh out loud a good few times! Brilliant! Thanks so much, lads!
Guys are going to do some central Europe shows? :)
Thanks guys, I am actually waiting to have an online call with the Careers Service, and just found this 🤣🤣 👍
The sales pitch at the end totally convinced me! I doubt the value of any investment in FAH would ever go down. Continued profits in happiness guaranteed!
Also please PLEASE let Foil grow out some 'staches in 2022....you are investing in his future happiness!
Happy new year guys. Wish you all the best... sketches in the world 😁
Lol "ex wife " is a challenging role, I hear but lots of money and future prospects  💸
My dad has a mustache and he’s had half the jobs in this video… you’re so on point it’s becoming scary LOL
😂😂😂👍❤
Welp, spies would be a hard one to do then
Now I can give a good excuse for FAHngirling in your channel and Patreon. I'm investing in my HAPPINESS 🤣 Too bad, I think it's still impossible for me to see one of your gigs 😥 Yeah, the moustache thing, I don't know why it's being called a pedostache now. Who started that anyway? 😥 (My father has a stache and is absolutely the nicest man in the world!) I think Arms would make a great teacher to children, he looks like a nice person when he's in Gerald-mode.
Arms UCD Certificate on the wall..! Why is it not hanging in ‘The Good Room’ at home like everyone else’s? 😜🤔🤣
Those eyes. Hog's specifically here (the others are grand too but got my fave). Worth buying tour tickets to see in person. Oh yeah, and for the great comedy too. 😜  Sorry to objectify!  I'll uh, take whatever punishment's suggested. 😁🥰❤️💕
The value of your investment can go up as well as down bahahha! ;-D
Ah class- started laughing on seeing the title and carried on laughing to the end
Are you still taking applications for your ex-wife?
Brilliant. So well read, I think you have a bright future ahead Arms if this comedy thing doesn't work out, you should listen to Foil.
This video reminded me of something from many years ago. I once worked in an office with multi-national employees, and one day an American guy showed up in a red suit and it was not even Halloween or Christmas. I kept my composure and quietly said  good morning as I am a polite Japanese woman 😏, but lost it when another American guy said "Hey, next time you go buy a used car, make sure you wear that suit. It'll confuse the dealer if he is selling or buying."
Just bought my ticket to the show in Boston! Looking forward to it!
Hahaha 😂
What if you came to Tenerife to do a show? Yes? Yes!!!!!
"Your handwriting is atrocious, you'll make a wonderful doctor."  Suddenly reminded me of one of the facilitators of a training seminar i attended, watching me write and commenting, "do you have any plans to become a doctor?" without taking his eyes off what i was writing. I answered, "hopefully?". He looked me in the eye and said, "You have the potential" 😩😂 lol Now, 6 years after that, i'm in my 3rd year of medschool
January '21...YUP!
Arms, is your moustache done with brown felt tip???
The title itself is hilarous, I haven't even watched it yet and I'm laughing 😂. I know this is gonna be a good one!
Any chance of a behind the scenes look at you guys... I just want to know if your worth stalking..😂😂😂
The moustache guy is too picky. Tyler Durden would have done a better job than Foil. Or quicker, anyway.
Actually, it makes more sense than all BS IQ and so shrink tests.
The barrage of jokes at the end caught me off guard, I had to stop and rewatch the bit again to properly process the jokes This was just genius ! xD
Strength to strength each week lads.. Keeps up the good work... I Can't wait until the Vicar Street gig.. Dum dah..
20 years ago, my dad had a mustache…and he was a PE teacher …I can confirm how accurate this is 😂
Pablo Escobar  That is all...
Lads, i just realized that this is your 399th video already. One more and it's 400 videos guys! So excited... 😍😍😍
Apart from witty and funny, the three of ye are wonderful actors!
Hilariously amazing. I want to thank you for making these videos. Well done 👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I really wish he had suggested Lion Tamer! 🦁😜😂
That mustache is what we call a Rotzbremse. Sorry.
how about you find another couple of guys and you could form a comedy trio? Just a thought 😉❤️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Please, oh please, come to Australia.
I guessed Plumber
Universitas Hibernia Nationalis 💀💀💀💀💀 HAPPY NEW YEAR FA&H!!! Wish you all health, happiness can't wait to attend your gigs in 2022!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 All the best and thank you for getting us through 2021!
My ex wife :D  You are awesome ♥
Ah it's good to start the year with happy Thursdays. Thank you, guys 😊
Did he weirdly propose marriage at the end? 😆
No reference to a certain political figure of the 40's? Mustache? Anyone?
My dad looks like a wrestler but he's a CTO of a company. I look like a Detective (as my friends point out), I'm an editor.   I'd sure like to find what Foil thinks of me by my looks. I think I'll be a unused car salesman...
Quite a few doctors in the family, I can read only one’s handwriting (he practices calligraphy of all things). Why is this so scarily accurate.
That was fun! But what is the typical hairdresses car? I mean, I might have to change professions now.
"You've tried it your way, okay, and you've still ended up in here."  🤣  (The mustache is also ideal for a career in adult films, but the assessor would have to see more; would you take off your clothes please?)
My exwife!! 🤣🤣🤣💀
I'm scared each week you won't post. 60 year old female yank
What a joy to wake up on a Thursday and know its a FAH day! You've kept me laughing through lockdown and I want to know...when are you coming to Birmingham?!(UK)
wonder if foil help arms with the moustache as he’s the expert.
Cant believe Foil is not the one wearing the moustache this time 🤭😂
That was brilliant lads
hahaha u totally got it thats what they do nice :)
To those who say I never used my college degree, well!  there it is right there on the wall
Now, Arms, did you grow that or is it at expense from the props department?
Loved it ! Also liked Arms’ degree in the background:) thanks !
But what if he removed the mustache all together? 🤔        Oh I know!! Comedian!
a moustache seems to be the perfect base to built up on - add a perm-porn star, add slipper shoes-bus driver, add a short-sleeved shirt with a leaking biro in the shirt pocket-geography teacher. ENDLESS job opportunities...
Arms are you back on comments? I've missed you!
Great way to start the new year lads. Thanks for making me laugh.
Ahh! that's where I've been going wrong all these years. I need to grow a beard to get more job opportunities. I'm a woman though. Do you think they'll notice a fake stick on one??🤔 Thanks so much for the first proper laugh of the year😂👌🏽🏅
After watching this video, I now know that I'm qualified for my dream job as a Hipster Barber. Thanks Guys
Now I'm truly curious what job he would recommend for me 🤔😂 Such a hilarious sketch to kick off the new year! 🥳
He rarely smiled. I'd say accounting. A senior accountant or eager auditor.
"investment in future happiness" is how I think of your patreon 😄 Thanks for a great start to the year, guys! Hope you have a wonderful one!
My husband is a supermarket manager and he has a moustache, so can confirm that this sketch is totally accurate 😂😂 Happy New Year! Wishing you health, happiness and oooodles of success!
Loved the part about the plumber and the idea of investing in the future during the ad at the end
I have a friend with a moustache that I need to send this to...  Another great sketch!  Happy New Year lads!
Oh my God, Car-Salesmen was exactly what I was thinking when seeing the thumbnail!
I want to know if this career counselor has ever successfully convinced someone to become a rabbi based on their facial hair alone.
Come on, Arms! You gotta be a Rabbi. Stop being so picky and take it. It's a chance one in a million! Rabbi with a super Irish face will blow people's minds. Thanks for making me laugh! Hugs from snowy Russia!
Is it weird that I wish I could get some career consulting like this? I mean, moustache guy got some truly unexpected tips, what better way to have a fresh start...  Anyway: Happy new year, hope you enjoyed the holidays and everything!
An excellent sketch guys 👌 Btw i think we all totally agree on the jobs that require mustache 😂
January 21?  This has taken a year in post prod?
Brilliant as always! That mustache though, Arms. Really hard to forget about it like you keep suggesting.  Oh and your Degree Certificate (or Diploma; different countries call it different names) makes an appearance, not in your files but on the wall of the Career Counselor. Hilarious. Love, Natasha.
Poor guy, going for careers advice from a man who has stolen and displayed the guy's degree certificate in his office 😔😆
I knew it was gonna be a used car salesman!!  Haha. Wish we could afford to see you😭 a bit too far of a trip from Hawaii. Good luck on your tour.
Hah! Brilliant, as usual! Happy New Year, lads!
Mustache... Plumber... Wait! There's a Mario joke waiting to happen here and I can't think of one... Well, comedy sure is a craft that I gladly leave to the pros. Here's to another great year of sketches and shows 🥂 Happy New Year everyone!
Alot of potential there. Bus driver, lollipop man/person, warehouse manager at a supermarket, civil servant at the job centre, security firm that monitors cameras from a different country and phones the police when there is a theft. The list goes on... I also just realised That's a Jim McDonald, Coronation Street Tash circa 90's  🤣
Thank god, the mustache is for the sketch and not a permanent thing, could not concentrate on anything else until it came up
Thank you
Arms! Welcome back! 😃 Hope you had a lovely time off 😊  Guess whaaat?.... Sorry what was that? I can't hear you.....*awkward silence*......... Okay I'll tell you then!   I'm trying to teach myself the mouth trumpet at the moment and I DID IT yesterday! I did it! For just a second! And then it was gone 😔  But now I know it's possible, so I'm going to keep working on it. Wish me luck! 😃
It's absolutely true about handwriting. When people see my handwriting they usually decide that I'm a doctor and surprise that I've been working in marketing more than 3 years😁
Had to rewatch the end part. “I don’t have time for this” hit me so hard.
Another job you can do with that stache: becoming a beer brewer of a brewery called The Stache ;)
I'd want to see what job does Anne Flanagan gets assigned based on her 'Appearance'
ha! never clicked so fast for a video 😁👍. first thing I thought: adult entertainment industry 🤣 🤣 🤣
they are moustache jobs! so funny, thanks for making getting out of bed today easier 😂
Loved the stache! <3 <3
I don’t get why he doesn’t want to be “my ex-wife”, sounds like a great career 😂
In South Africa, with a moustache like that, you would have to settle for a career as a traffic policeman.
So now Foil uses Arms's degree to show off although he has 2 of his own??!? Well, the way he approaches his client here, obviously his degrees are all he has and I am not sure what exactly HE learned... (Sorry, Foil! I know it's just the character you are playing!)
So in order to be sketch comedians, you have to look like total legends then right?? ;))
"your posture is perfect for someone in IT" I had to sit straight back up after hearing that, while at work.... IT work (from home tho so I still laughed out loud) 😂🤣
“It’s January. You’re bombarded with ads. The one thing you need to know is Foil Arms and Hog tickets. You’re investing in future happiness.” Honestly, the last time they came to New York, I took a photo with them and my mother said, damn, you look thrilled in this picture. So, investment in future happiness confirmed. 😁 See you lads in March.
i agree, very difficult to look past the moustache 😂
Used car salesman technique with the tickets, lol
Investing in my future happiness, I already have my Vicar Street tickets! 🤣
"not with that mustache" HAHAHAH LMFAOO
Ahh that was class. Happy new year, FAH! Now that I've got a smile on my face, I can start work. Thanks
You’re back!! Welcome to 2022!! Love this sketch! Starting off strong guys🌟
Why do I see the job he finds going like this: “welcome sir I am so glad you are hear we are squished for workers”  see moustache “well have you thought of being a car sales men?”
😂💚☘️no moustache ...🧔🧔🧔
Yay! First sketch of the year! But, I mustache you a question: why can’t these sketches be longer?! ♥️😂  PS… As an educator, I agree…not since the 80’s has a teacher had that kind of stache. If I saw someone (and I mean anyone) walk in with an 80’s stache, I’d consider them to be extremely suspicious! 😬😉 Ha!
*NOT SINCE THE 80'S*          hheheheheheh he is the spitting image of my teacher in the 80's
Great video lads-tbh i can see him working in a vintage diner with that moustache
“that’s it, i’m leaving” “my ex wife!!” had me in stitches, great job
🤭 poor career advisor, it was easier years ago - also, folks, yes! Invest in your future happiness, it definitely worth it
Is this the same character as in Annual Review Foil is playing? I def think he is wearing the same outfit...
So if "ex-wife" is a job, is getting divorced from one being hired or fired?
“My ex wife “ at that moment you got me lads😂
Adult fillum star...
Was relieved to see no mustache when you were dum dah-ing. 😅
I usually stay up until 2 am🇲🇽 on thursdays just to go to sleep in a good mood after seeing your weekly videos. Totally worth it 🤭🤭😂👌
"Career Advice recommendations: Civil service, bank manager, Ryanair customer service, ...My ex-wife" Wait what?😂😂😂
Hey guys, thanks to you we know now that a microwave is one of the most important tools in the job agent's office. 😄😄  #props.
For me, a used car salesman is a Slavic or African man.
He can't work as a teacher with that mustache. But I thought about drug cartel? 😅Damn it, I watched too much tv about narcos.   #latinamericanvibes
'You're in your mid 30s and you still haven't figured it out. It's time to try something different!'  Wow I feel called out and inspired at the same time! Not sure what job I look like though. At the moment I just look tired! It is slightly odd seeing a mustache on Arms instead of Foil! Happy New Year lads!
Hellooooo!!!! ლ(^o^ლ) Hog is the mustache 0-0
I loved the ending with the Ryanair customer service 😂 That mustache is fit to serve a craft beer founder as well 😄  Hope you had a good start into the new year!
Intersting to note your ex-wife has a mustache
I was thinking more 1970s cop
“What career am I gonna do? I haven’t figured it out yet. You’re in your mid-thirties so it’s time to try something different.” So…sketch comedy performer?
Spot on! That mustache is terrible but glorious!
happy new year guys!!! another great sketch all the best for 2022.
Oh heck yeah!!! I love the old sketch with Foil as the career counsellor 😂 stoked with this one!!
Another honored appearance of the diploma!
You look like Chris from abroad in Japan 😂
Der Sketch ist echt prima! :) Frohes neues Jahr! Ich hoffe, ihr seid gut reingekommen (oder reingerutscht, wie wir in Deutschland sagen;)). Falls ihr es letzte Woche noch nicht gelesen habt: Danke noch mal, dass ihr mir durch ein sehr schwieriges 2021 geholfen habt! –Katharina <3
'Hairdresser, because of your car.'   I thought it would be because of the hair😂 because of Arms' gorgeous hair... Still the mustache thing makes me laugh hard😂😂😂 what a wonderful treat this first Thursday of the year lads. Thank you so much!
I guess it was your turn to wear the mustache this time, eh Arms? I know it's not your favourite thing, sorry about that ... 😲 But those careers from 2:06 - hilarious! Great sketch! 👍
A teacher with that 'stache (also, was that a hidden stash of Foil's moustaches?)
Yayyyyy! New year, new beginnings, new FAH video! So happy to see you guys in 2022 😊 And yes, Canada tickets purchased 😄🎉
Gonna make "look past the moustache" my 2022 new year's resolution. It's going to make me a better person I just know it.   Some painful truths bombs dealt there by Foil, my gosh... mid-thirties here too, still haven't figured it out either *gulp*   PS I kinda want to see this sketch with Arms and Foil switching roles, I don't know why... was that ever on the table?
"I want to work with children! " "Not with that mustache." 🤣🤣🤣  How much convincing did it take for you to agree to wearing a fake mustache, Arms?
If he was willing to shave the moustache he could get a job in a card shop.  Or selling hand guns.
First of all, hope you had a wonderful celebration of the New Year and Christmas!  How the hell did you know that I have EXACTLY that on Monday?! You're some kind of magicians! (Yes yes, I don't have a job anymore, it's whatever, my contract expired and they basically wanted me to work for free...they will still call in spring...apparently) So yeah, here we are again: In front of my computer, just had a shower, the only difference it wearing my FAH hoodie now (which is the softest thing on the planet...who hasn't gotten one yet...DO!)  I also need to congratulate you on your day as it's Three Kings' Day! (It's a Catholic joke, people, just forget it xD)
Love Arms’ Mustache 😎
Ha!! That ending. Ouch. Hahaha
HAHAHAHA A  whole video just to talk about arm's mustache ? also why didn't you consider the option of getting rid of mustache ? Wish I lived in europe for your gigs :( hope to see you guys in Melbourne again soon
Always a great way to start the working day with you (especially if it's the last one for me this week)! But now wondering what career I look like? 🤔
"Ryanair customer service"... 🤣
Welcome back lads!  Strong Matchmaking Estate Agency vibes here 🤩 Nice to have another of its ilk 😜
With that moustache, no consideration for becoming a painter? Tsk tsk.
I'm back to school today and this really brightened my day thanks guys😊💖
Well Arms, moustache or no moustache, I'd buy a used car from you any day! (Or a lawnmower, if you're just trying to get rid of it at the moment)
Hipster barber 😂 Happy new year.
What a wonderful way to start the FAH year! 💝
I gotta agree, with that mustache, he'd be a perfect used car salesman.
Frohes neues Jahr Arms!  Schön dass du wieder da bist heute - wir haben dich ein bisschen vermisst letzte Woche 😊 Genießt du deinen Urlaub? Bist faul? Schläfst lange? Legst die Füße hoch?
Kinda hope I don't look like my job 😄 curious what he would advice though 🤣😬
Bring back the Christmas doom dah
No wonder I got the job for the pre-school teacher position, it's cuz I look like one!
I did not suspect the used car salesman in the beginning and was suprised how well it fitted. Well done lads. I hope the new year brings you lots and lots of joy, simmilar to how your scetches bring this joy to us.
Awesome sketch as always - especially the closing line! :'D
The career guidance guy is actually being reminded of the guy who was trying to sell him a car, back when he was a Business student.
I was slightly concerned that the poor chap used a Facebook Ad to find that careers advisor .. be wary.😆 I'm still.convinced that Arms..your new name is Sherlock Arms: Sketch Detective due to your preferred career path. Has a ring to it 😂 😁😁 now to sort out Foil and Hog lol 🤣 good way to start the new year! Loved it. Great stuff lads 😊🎊🎉
Hilarious stuff as usual and the plumber and other jobs joke haha relatable
Thank Foil it's Thursday!! I needed a good laugh, thanks lads 😘😂👏 (So glad I've invested in future happiness too ☺️)
Nice 😉😏
Absolutely fantastic! 🤣 I could do with a change of job, does Foil do appointments?
#BringBackTheMoustache
You have atrocious handwriting so you could be a doctor  Me a doctor - hey,,,,,, some pharmacists can read them
Foil must be absolutely delighted - a whole sketch about mustaches 😂
In my mid thirties I became a guidance counsellor. I don't know what that says about me...  Happy new year's lads!
Oh brilliant. This is so true. I once had a haircut that made people ask if I was a physiotherapist.
The "my ex wife" jokes, dude when there done well like here they actually kinda work
Well my Thursdays are sorted because these lads chose the right career so 😎👍
Finally mustache becomes the leading role in a sketch😂
Ok, now I’ve been called out for my hatred of facial hair. Cool start to the year, lads.
Stood at the bus stop laughing out loud to this during the school rush, brilliant 😂
omg it’s Thursday already?
2:13 laughed so hard at Ryanair customer service, you guys rocked!
aw, I have a meeting with the unemployment office today. What job will I get if I show up in a boa and feathers?
Don't think there was any doubt who was arms in this one! 😂
Thursdays are always a little brighter when I get the notification for one of your videos. Thanks for you hard work. Another brilliant sketch!
are applications for wife still open?
Mustache jobs 😆😆 hilarious!!   Love it!!
Happy New Year, happy new moustache, happy new job as a used car salesman 👍
I liked that last line more than I should have 😅
Genuinely surprised that porn star wasn’t suggested…really quite shocked. 😆😆😆😆😆 Also, aren’t you a year late? Check the year at the very start of the sketch…😊😊😊
I have no will to live. Perfectly suited to work in customer as i do atm ahah
Humans judge like this all the time! 😆😆😆😆. I’m glad it’s been brought out into the open for a good ole laugh! 😁.
This entire video is basically an assassination of Arms’ moustache.. from Foil of all people! :)
Love it!!!!! Always funny.
Happy new year from Spain.
This is scarily accurate! Best first sketch of the year ever, hope you guys had a good break! 😁😁
I'm just imagining Nigel Mansell getting turned away because his moustache adds too much drag to the F1 car hahahahaha
Funny sketch lads
"Can you forget I have a moustache for a second"... No Arms I cannot. It haunts me. Ps. The work stereotypes are spot on
Quick little storytime that might put a smile on your face Arms: So Rebecca (who've you met) and I have become best friends because of you fabulous fellas but we still haven't met (I know, crazy!) but it's gonna happen on the 25th of February as we're gonna be going to Swines in Vicar Street TOGETHER cheers lads for making my life better always! Also haven't slept in like a day so if any of that doesn't make sense blame on the jetlag😬💖💖💖 Oh congratulations on the WWCA too, I knew yous would win, totally deserved!
If only all career counsellors were this efficient.
Still waiting for a playlist called 'Cameos for Conor's degree'.
"Your handwriting is atrocious." I feel called out. xD
Happy New Year! I play this game in airport check-in queues :)
The 80s/mustache…that’s not a pron reference, is it?
Perfect used car salesman moustache 😅😂
first😌
G’day  mates! 👋
Such a joy to begin the first Thursday of this year with one of your delightful sketches :) This is absolutely spot-on!
Damn, is that Freddie Mercury?
Here's my resume.  Cool,but we won't need that. Your moustache is telling me........
That mustache, tho 🤣🤩
Nothing like a new job in 2022, I could be a rabbi
Ouch!
I want to make a witty comment about this video but unfortunately I'm only 17 so I don't know enough about jobs to make a witty comment!
MUSTACHE?!
What about for an episode viruses hold a party and great video
Love yous
