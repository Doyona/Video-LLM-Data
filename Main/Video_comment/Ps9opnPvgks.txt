3:51 aged insanely well and I’m not joking didn’t age as well this year
67
3:18 6…7?
0:22 aged really well actually
7:49 "i don't see this as a very big signing"
Watching this after Saquan going for 2000 yards and wins OPOY while winning his first superbowl: :))
Nah Zach balled out this year
Watching this a year later watching a dumpster fire of an offseason. Last year was so much more eventful
I’m watching this a actual year later
3:00
Xavier McKinney is the dpoy 7 ints at week 14
I’m a Steelers fan. I am so mad that Derek Henry went to the ravens
Saquon will not score any touchdowns cause whenever he gets down to the one Jalen will say “ TUSH PUSH!!!!!!!”
Sixty9,1!kes
Every like this comment gets= 1 push up
ummm steelers just signed justin fields
Fields to the Steelers now
I hope Saquon tears his acl in the first game again.
Justin Fields to the Steelers
We’re  Taking Caleb Williams
“Old and washed up Devin Singletary”  Bro is literally 26 years old🤣
Meags Denver actually isn’t in a bad position, went from dead to last to 7th in cap space and prepping for a total rebuild. Cant be in a much better place than they are now for what they want to accomplish
Saquon just gonna have his TDs vultured by the tush push 😭
i was doing a franchise in madden 23 last year and i was trying to make a league of only auto-generated, and then was looking back at who won the super bowl and Bryce Huff won the MVP with 48 sacks in a season
the seahawks still have Julian love who made the probowl
Steelers nation let’s ride
As I’m watching this 🚨Fields traded to Steelers. I guess they gave up on him😂
Ravens have Derrick Henry
Ekeler went from a first round fantasy pick to a 8th round pick with dat “ Shit on me O-Line”!
I am gonna try to draft Jerry Judy in fantasy maybe 4 round-6 round?
“Releasing Poyer over Hamlin is crazy” no it is not! Hamlin is getting paid 4 years for $3,640,476 and Poyer was getting paid 2 years for 19,500,000 so it is not dumb your dumb it’s called cap space
The Steelers got a massive steal for a good ( I mean at least better than Kenny Pickett like a decent QB) quarterback for 1.2 million in my opinion that is a better steal then the ravens Derick henery pick up cause of the price
The off-season for a bills fan like me were fcked
Not saying he's better or even anywhere close in talent but I'm pretty sure Devin Singletary is younger than Saquon Barkley lol
Bro d Henry to the ravens 😢😢
I am so mad, I’m a Steelers fan and Russell Wilson I always thought was soooo BAD.
sorry meags but the lions run was good but its the bears time now
I've been talking to a girl I've had my eye on for a while now. Just texted her how her day was going :)
The fact that this video is now out dated is crazy. It’s been one day this offseason has been crazy
Bears taking Marvin Harrison
Patriots also got Antonio Gibson
can confirm on your words of wisdom
11:06 omg thank u for saying this cause everyone is acting like Caleb Williams is literally god reincarnated. Like idc what the scouts are saying. Scouts said trubisky would be good and look at him now.   But with the bears getting keenan idk what we should do honestly cause now we got a super bowl contending team that just needs a hood ass qb to take the wheel
That kirko thing makes so happy and probably you to Meags because then he’ll suck way MORE
Ok but y are the insta comments on all these free agency moves just being haters fr 😂. I haven’t seen one comment actually celebrating any of these moves 😭
I love when papa pretends to know ball
it depends on what my friends post is
BEARS GOT KEENAN ALLEN!😮😮😮😮
The only reason bills will not release damar Hamlin because they will get so much hate
zappe said he signed back with the pats last year because he knew he was gonna start eventually. so he a hater
Heard your words of wisdom and decided to propose to my GF. She is my fiancee now, so words of wisdom went well!
Justin Fields to Seattle quote me on that
Texans kinda going crazy in free agency 👀
How tf did he struggle in Denver ?   42 tds 19 ints and yards were down but  Year 1: Worst head coach ever Nathaniel Hackett   Year 2: Relearned a new offense and was still doing better then most QBs
This made me think, is this sort of the same type of scenario comparing him to cmc, both come from a trash team, had an injury history in trash team cause they were force fed. Now they are both on better teams and the weight is taken off them and boom they are dynamite? Hopefully that’s the case
Btw Jordan poyer is old and tre hasn’t played in like 2 years we are good big man
Shit
Bijan allegier is the most underrated rb duo ngl
As a packers fan what I’ll say about Aaron Jones is as much as I love him and I’m gonna miss having him he was great, but he’s had injury struggles and at times he hasn’t even been the best back between him and AJ Dillon. We need a guy who’s going to be consistent and healthy. I hope Aaron Jones does well with the Vikings I’m sure he will he’s a great player I’ll always be rooting for him💯
I missed this kind of reaction videos 🙂. Thank you 🙏
Aaron 29 josh 26 yrs old makes sense replacing Aaron
im going to talk to that girl :)
Bro definitely has a headset dent he the next Jynxzi if he gets a buzz
keenan allen to the bears
Saying Jamal Adams is still a good safety is wild. Look at the stats. Dude cannot cover for his life
"Old washed up Singletary" bro is only 26 and had 900 yards on only 10 starts 💀
Aaron jones was struggling with injuries this season and has had a few other seasons while Josh Jacob’s hasn’t had many injuries which is why I think they brought him in because he’s just as good as Jones if not better but hasn’t been injury prone. That’s my guess though.
It's madden franchise mode
As a ravens fan im happy about derrick henry
JYNXZI REACTED TO YOU ON STREAM WITH ALMOST 100K VIEWERS
These games are overpriced trash that are using outdated engines that is basicly the same thing you paid for last year, buy if your dumb or hate video games cuz this trash suck mondo dik
This upcoming season is going to be cinema
I hate being a cowboys fan in the offseason
13:59 bro u said u don’t want old washed up singletary but singletary is younger than Barkley🤣
“Old washed up Devin Singletary” is like 26🤣
Russ’s last year in Seattle he was dog shit by the way
good vid but aaron jones is better than josh jacobs
Me watching the video to see his opinion on Henry at Baltimore and he doesn’t talk about it 🥲
Nerf video
Best RB duo Lamar and Derrick Henry 😂😂
Someone explain brain burns franchise tag then trading him
I would never wish this on anybody but I think saquon is due for an injury this season
Who has the habit of reading comments?  😎😊
I was wearing an eagles shirt at the gym and a day before we signed saquan and a giants fan was giving me 💩 and said “good luck against us this year” and laughed and walked away…. Who gets the last laugh now boitch
Shane topp dupe????
Saquon to the Eagles feels like the universe finally aligned. Can't wait for the season to start! 🏈✨
Next season without cousins is gonna feel different
SMH this man promoting prizepicks without even trying
Actually fuckin nuts. Teams are making huge moves already?
I still think you should not be to scared
Go falcons
16:32 this is why we love mmg
You should do words of wisdom after every video
and steelers picked up queen there gunna be a force this year for sure
Is that instagram or twitter
Alr Eagles we look stacked pls dont fold up mid season (again) Fly Eagles Fly
This free agency had been wild tbh…niners need to start making moves and resigning players
Hope he sees Derrick Henry with the ravens 😭🙏🙏
AND the steelers just got patrick queen
What does that guy mean 4 wr 2s Kirk has proven himself as a 1 and Ridley already did before the jags
got even weirder today
Mmg ima listen to your advice gonna do it
As an avid European soccer fan, it's so weird to see players move to a hated rival within a division (Saquon, Patrick Queen, etc.). In 2002 a player moved to his old team's arch rival and got a literal PIG's HEAD thrown at him while he was on the field. The NFL needs more of that energy
Raven on 🔝
basically Aaron Jones took a paycut last, we asked him to take another huge paycut his agent said it was too low Packers released him early out of respect
Calling Singltary old and washed up then saying Saquon is a good pickup when he’s older and more injury prone😭 We also got Devin for less then half of the price
Cowboys are actually cooked(I’m a cowboys fan)
Saquon with eagles will be tuff but only if he can stay healthy and if he can’t then they gonna miss swift
Go Pack Go!!!
What he doesn’t understand about the Simmons release is that he barely did a thing in the last 8 games and gave up twice the touchdowns of anyone else when in man coverage so it’s not a bad release
aron jones went to the vikings
Devin Singletary is literally younger than Saquon lmaoooo
The Jacobs jones duo would have been up there if not better then the Ingram Kamara duo
Agree - believe Bears will trade first pick
I feel like saquon signing is overrated and it won’t change the eagles down the line.
Pitts started out with 1000 yards thanks to Matt Ryan. Watch him do it again with Cousins.
Dude everyone acts like the eagles are getting rookie Saquon. He’s 27 which is old for RB and he’s injury prone. He’s also getting insanely over paid😭
not mixon on the texans
not a good day to be a giants fan at fkn all
wait till he sees where derrick Henry went to!
And we already need an update
Tee Higgins also requested a trade too
I just like that I’m a Vikings fan and we got Aron jones 😂😂😂😂😂
W words of wisdom papa meags
Derrick Henry went to the ravens
This dude just called singletary old and washed but bro is only 26……….
This is one of the most craziest off-season
Joe Nixon went to the Texans and Antonio Gibson went to the patriots
Why the hell are we getting Mac Jones he is garbage
(Hot Take) Caleb Williams will make Chicago worse
With a franchise tag it extends the time you have to negotiate a contract and if you don’t reach an agreement then they get a 1 year fully guaranteed deal. They can also be traded once signed something
The eagles released Dandre swift
According to Ian rapoport Arron Jones is coming to the Vikings
Jamal adams was trash in 2023, be lucky to even start games for team a this year
Aaron jones was on the last year of his contract, so there was 17 mil cap hit and no garrentees. So no dead cap and 17 million saved
Wait til he sees where Henry went
I miss Aaron Jones😢
Holy shi the Eagles are actually stacked! Got CJGJ back too! GGs
Saquan fantasy gonna be horrendous with hurts tush pushing for every rushing td
devin singletary is younger than saquon barkley
do another one of these with the other half of free agents Matt pleasee
Cowboys taking  Ezekiel  again
Im so happy the pack is actually making moves this offseason next season boutta be some heat
Fletcher cox has been washed for the last 3 seasons. it's not that bad of loss, and now the younger players will get more snaps.
this offseason is just me and my friends trading the good players to make sure our other friend has the punishment in fantasy
Henry and Davin😈😈😈
Henry on the ravens now which is crazy
as a bronocs fan this video is just a whole lot of pain
Do an update?
It might be a dream scenario for Barkley but a nightmare for Philly. Hes gonna get hurt again
Justin fields is my QB
Mmg it’s been crazy because I really been watching you since the madden mobile days I started watching you because you opened packs and I was broke little kid and couldn’t buy none I was 12 then and now im 20 but to see you still relevant and still making great content I hope god keeps rewarding and blessings you ❤️
My favorite part of free agency is how we all consistently say "trade" and "signing" at the exact wrong times
You’re right, it’s not a fun time to be a Giants fan 😢
The bears thing reminds me of the movie draft day. Bo Callahan is Caleb Williams , the bears are the browns in this situation, gotta feelin the bears will trade down
People that think the falcons are dangerous with Kirk 💀  Don’t forget Vikings had JJ-JA-TJ
Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ he is our only hope, just repent and have child like humble faith God bless!!!!!!.
Wait until he sees who the ravens pick up
Good time to be an eagles fan 🦅🦅🦅
It didn't mention the biggest move ever marcus davenport on the lions 😂
Eagles just slammed the window on their chances at a Superbowl,,we need CB not a hurt expensive RB we could of drafted a 3 rounder
the end of this video made me go talk to the girl I thought was cute. turns out she wanted me too. thanks papa❤
11:02  I’m also not convinced of what the bears are doing
F the Simmons release
Papa acting like this was the first time he saw the Kirk Cousins news 😂
The Chiefs should get tre’davious because they are trading lu’ures sneed
I was on suicide watch before this free agency (panthers fan) I’m going through it all after this free agency…
As a cowboys fan trading our franchised tagged running back Tony pollard and not replacing him hurts can’t lie we don’t have a running back now we haven’t done anything brooo😢
Being a giants fan rn is tough
MMG I am a titans fan and are last game in Nashville he left us with a goodbye speech so we saw this coming. LONG LIVE THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm not a firm believer in this Saqoun move because Sirianni has yet to prove he can run the ball effectively with the best o line in the league. He runs too much shotgun, which limits running options because you can't effectively run outside zones that way, which is one of the better run schemes. It makes your run game too predictable and removes the effectiveness of play action because Hurts' eyes are downfield when faking, so nobody thinks he's handing it off.
Cowboys let’s cry 😢
As a giants fan I have no words. They better sign McCarthy
I think the bears take Marvin Harrison as a WR1 for Justin Fields
I wonder if Jetas will stick around with the vikings now that cousins is with the falcons.
Pq is dead to me also I’m glad the commanders are doing something
From what I understand Jones was owed like 17 mil. The Packers gave a final offer of somewhere around 4 mil + 2 mil in incentives. Jones and his agent declined. So once that happed the Packers went to look for a new running back and landed Josh Jacobs. Then they released Jones who signed w the Vikings for 6 mil + 1 mil in incentives on a 1 year deal. The Packers were really close on the market value of Jones but he did get a little more with the vikings in that base salary and overall. As a Packers fan its sad to see him go but I hope he makes his money, and I wish him and his family the best.
Joe mixon went to the texans
Whats crazy this season is the amount of players going to rival teams
Running back shuffle
Austin ekeler is 28😂😂
Derrick Henry to the Ravens
Why would the panthers franchise tag Brian Burns if they're just gonna trade him?
As a dolphins fan, getting jordan poyer is so good, first of all, he's really good. Second of all, bills are our division rival.
Dude we need  a full run through today bro. So much more happened
Bro just didn’t talk about minshew to the raiders like that isn’t a good move for them 😭
people who want the season to start right now say here
As a pats fan if they take Marvin Harrison jr in this years draft than this 6 rounder better be the next Tom Brady😭😭😭😭
JASON COME BACK
Henry is a raven
Cjgj to the birds!
Falcon will go 9-8 and make playoffs
Deuce Vaughn Is going to be the starter for the cowboys the broncos and Vikings are gonna choice between JJ and MPJ and bears are tryna sign a lot of players to get Caleb Williams out of his diva shit
I can’t get over how little pitts does and he still has a X-Factor in Madden…
My commanders just signing people at this point😭😭
I get the point that Devin Singletary isn't th same as saquon Barkley, but Singletary is 26 years old😭 he isn't old and washed
man fuck fantasy it's all about Philly getting another Lombardi..
Need an update video
being a giants fan hurts man :(
Bro this video is the 2days old once it came out
Derrick Henry bought a house in Dallas just to troll the trash cowgirls and went to the ravens, ravens gonna be a real scary team
Words of wisdom were misinterpreted. I am now in jail...
Let’s not forget the Steelers also got Patrick Queen
So happy to be a Eagles fan cowgirls do nothing commanders do ok tinys lose all there plays.
Justin fields sucks. Stop defending him he is a horrible quarterback
The Landon Dickerson disrespect in the comments is wild one of the best young linemen in the game 😂
Packers had the best backfield for about an hour 😂
0:52 Xaiver is a D1 Hater
Biggest problem with Fields is he hasn't shown enough to get a new deal and his rookie deal ends soon. I fully expect the Bears to trade him.
Commanders lost Antonio Gibson so they replaced him with ekeler who is better than Antonio Gibson but play the same role
Steelers country, let’s ride
Might need to be a part 2 😂
Gotta make an update video
Panthers shoulda of traded burns last year would of got 2 first and 2nd so technically there dumb not smart.
So excited for this coming season
Don’t worry means have me on and I’ll explain any contract lingo
This a whole madden franchise atp
Man goes old Devin singleterry😂 man was drafted one year after saquon
FALCONS GOING TO THE SUPER BOWL MARK MY WORDS
Lets Go Eagles!
“And that shotgun on your bedside table is looking real nice right now” 😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀

Can definitely tell exactly when this was filmed yesterday 😂
as a broncos fan i think everyone that watches football should petition for the NFL to kick us out of the league because we literally have zero good players, and we wont win anything for the next 25 years, the broncos shouldnt be a football team and im tired of them being ass year after year after year, screw super bowl 50 that feels like it never even happened at this point, so honestly just ban us from the league #banthebroncos
by the way Joe Mixon is signing with the texans
I know this might seem hella casual but why is josh fallen LB "athletic" josh allen as If qb josh allen isn't either
As a packer fan I can’t believe they let jones go but then jones signed with the division rivals that’s just sick 😭
2:50 As a packer fan I thought we was about to have the best 1-2 punch with jones and Jacobs just for it to last 1 hour 😭
Lol panthers franchised brian burns and then traded him
Need a part 2 😂
Derrick Henry js went to the ravens which is crazy 💀💀
When MMg Realise he needs to film a part 2 to this video
Arron jones to Minnesota 🎉
Antonio Gibson went to the Pats
you should do a tier list at the beginning of next season for how each teams offseason went! like an L tier, a broke even tier, and a crazy upgrade tier!
This FA has been unreal. The Eagles and Texans are the 2 winners so far though
DUDE WTF THAT GIRL THING AT THE END WAS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AND SHE AGREED TO GO OUT WITH ME!!!!!!!!
How is Devin Singletary washed and old? 26 years old and coming off best season
I wish I had that duo in Green Bay but Josh Jacobs it good now I wonder how good the north is now with all what is happening
@1:26 i picked hik up at 4th this past season in PPR and finished 2nd. Hes going to go number 1 or 2 nmw now.
It's even funnier when you remember the Steelers play the Broncos in Denver this year
All these splash moves were made with the intent to try and beat a guy who loves ketchup and sounds like Kermit the Frog
15:48 i love those acc like the one of kadarioustoneyworshipper19
Who’s gonna tell him that burns got traded to the giants
I called Henry to the raven 19 weeks ago. I’m a suffering patriots fan
Kirk doesn’t scare me lmao. Dude had a great team in the Vikings and didn’t really look all that good to me.
Who here when the Vikings signed Aaron Jones👇👇💀💀💀💀💀
Jordan poyer to Miami 🐬🐬
Henry to the ravens
Lamar and Derrick Henry read option is going to be the next tush push
1 push up for every like this comment gets
as a falcons fan i’m stoked for this season
Has a Vikings I was hurting with the KC8 to ATL
Idk how much more I can take if the bears don’t pick Harrison.
The fact she is married and doing this is crazy
broncos fan here, that shotgun on my desk is looking real nice
saquon is washed, not saying he isn’t good, but not what he was, saquon isn’t much of an upgrade over swift anymore
1:03 L Xavierstarks
Brian Burns + Dexter Lawrence will cook tbh
henry to ravensss
I hope the falcons succeed
12:34   We only have 2 now   Gay.. Gabe Davis        Christian Kirk  Ridley is a free agent because if we resigned him we would have to give our second round pick for this year so we are hopefully going to get him back in free agency.   And Zay Jones is just a lot of money
Pollard is from tennese
wheres slur l
Bro I was so fuckin geeked for about 45 minutes. Now it's been a mixture of excitement and pain. WE LOST SIMONE BILES TOO, ALSO TO A DIVISION RIVAL
The Texans have had a great free agency I was pissed on Monday because it felt they weren’t trying to get a running back but I’m so happy we have Joe Nixon now
I think Brad Holmes said he was looking to use the salary cap to extend some players (Penei, Amon-Ra, Gared Goff) instead of making huge splashes in free agency, that being said, I think he should target a good corner (as of right now he has made moves to get two depth corners)
Don’t forget kirts 200+ million dollar deal 💀
Saying Kyle pitts hasn’t done anything is crazy. Bro had 1000 yards as a rookie which is more than Travis Kelce had this season. on my soul if he got a franchise QB he would be getting crazy numbers every year
Rumor goes. Aaron jones was asked to take a pay cut. He said no. They signed jacobs and that was it
No way he got the Texans Hunter in this
This is just madden auction house at this point
"Old washed up Devin Singletary" A 26 year old coming off a career year is old and washed up now?
Gotta do a part 2
Aye don’t forget Julio Jones on that Eagles Team 💀
You missed all the lions moves
Im a dolphins fan I happy for both Christian wilkins and Robert hunt
Vikings lost perk cousins and Danielle hunter to do absolutely jack shit
16:35 bro literally just talked about my biggest problem
WE DO NOT GIVE UP ON FIELDS NO SIR HES A BEAR FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR
Atlanta just picked up Mooney
Ngl if the bears have given up on Justin Fields then where is he gonna go? Atlanta is taken, Pittsburgh is taken, Raiders is likely taken by Gardner Mishew. Where will Justin go.
Aaron jones now a Viking and Joe mixon now a Texan
Ima do a push up for every dislike
As of right now Texans have Danielle Hunter and Joe Mixon finna be a crazy year
Eagles is jsut papas mut tean
I love being an eagles fan howie is literally a god
Didn't expect MMG to be the only guy on the Internet to look at the Burns trade somewhat objectively
and derrick henry to ravens
How old is this video? lol
Raiders nations to the playoffs
Henry to the ravens 🐦‍⬛ 😂😂😂
I can’t wait to see Matt reaction to where Henry went
Gotta bring this typa vid back throughout Free Agency
Derrick Henry is on the ravens we’re done for 💀
What about Derrick Henry? He went to the ravens.
NOOOOO! Juedy
Me trying to get a fantasy draft plan but from what happen today i dont even know
JUST MISSED DERRICK HENRY.
Henry with the flock now🔥🔥🔥
matt i will not talk to her, women scare me
13:56
Wassup papa
I love how the Seahawks have like no safeties or linebackers left and they’re just letting it happen. My only hope is that we can sign Patrick queen and pat surtain
This comment can't get 69 likes😏😁
11:26
"Steelers country, lets weld" - Russell Wilson probably
They paid him a three-year deal for 24 million Tony pollard
Hey daddy 👋👋👋👨👨👨
Bro don’t know CJGJ went back to Philly
U mentioned dead cap in the Jones releasing, We offered Jacobs the exact same fucking contract as Jones was already on   4 years, $48 million, like wtf were we doing bro. Dillon not resigning frees up space and with the baktiary(spelled wrong roast me) release there is so much $ available, y release him
saquon to philly is like bella to yo boy pizza
The packers are trying  to get younger guys
Nobody talking abt the fact that saquon went to the eagles of all teams… what a betrayal
Everyone been goin to their division rivals 🤣🤣🤣
Now today the Steelers got Patrick Queen from their rivals, the Ravens
8:18 I like how nobody talks about how both Josh Allens are freak athletes just because one is a QB
Raiders had to pay extra based on what I heard other teams were offering him like 25 mill a year or something like that so the raiders had to pay high to get him
Henry to the ravensssssss
Singletary being old and washed up at 26 is crazy
Who let the fastest runner and toughest runner on the same team?? 😢
Cj just went to the eagles
The Packers have made 2 big free agent signings...... What does this mean?
thoughts on derrick henry to the ravens?
Idk if you know this singletary is younger than saquon and just had a career year only paying him 5.5 per year and we added 2 oline to block
Hey papa i did what you said at the end of the vid and she didnt say anything, but i got intel from her friend saying she hates me
Nice Kitchen in the background Matt you’re awfully close to it
This went crazy insane!!!! From saquan to Eagles.To Derrick Henry to Ravens.
Old washed up Devin Singletary after his best season of his career
It Has Been Crazy.👍👍👍
Gonna have to make another just for todays😂😂😂. Power got signed, Nixon got traded, Steelers got roquan and traded deonte Johnson and a 6th for donta Jackson and a 5th. By far the best free agency off all time.(unless you are a giants fan lol)
I got a feeling that the Chiefs are gonna do something tomorrow cuz of Mahomes restructuring his contract (Chiefs could of kept Willie Gay) 😢
Athletic Josh Allen 💀
love how people thought derrick henry would go to the dallass cowboys
Sorry about cj Matt, glad to get him back tho😭😭😭
Thank you Denver! Pittsburgh really appreciates your donation!
I never will forget Robert hunt’s diving td
Bro really said old (26yo) washed up (coming off a great season one of his best) Devin singltray
Wait till bro see mixon on the texans
Swift got traded
Barkley is like cmc wasted good years with trash teams
Wait till he learns about the Giants signing Drew lock
The broncos paying Russel is like a father paying child support 😂😂😂
I can’t wait to see how Kirk does with this team. Drake will finally be able to show his full potential.
The fact the Lions gave CJGJ the exact same contract says a lot about bro...
I can't wait for a video now that CJGJ went to the Eagles
madden 25 is gonna be so fun with all these dudes on new teams and the draft class
MMGCasual moment about Mac jones. Zappe and Jones hate each other
CJGJ TO THE BIRDS
Bro why you dickriding josh Jacob's he's so fucking mid had 1 good year even if they had jones and Jacob's our duo would've been miles better
The bears are probably done with Fields. Their head coach was the only HC at Bo Nix's pro day today. They could have been scouting for other people, but they have the 1 pick in a stacked qb class. Hard to say they aren't going to draft one, but it still could be Marvin Harrison Jr. for them
Lowkey fake lions fan for thinking jacobs and jones is a better duo than Monty and Gibbs
U FORGOT KING HENRY AND…..patrick queen😭😭😭
Saquon won’t be a top 2 RB because Hurts is gonna steal all of his rushing TDs
we got rid of saquon for Devin Singletary💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
nah i cant fucking stand this shit the media has been doing and now you, the hate kirk has got including from you was already insane, but the moment he goes to the falcons its omg the falcons are now legit. HE FUCKING SUCK isnt that right?
how is devin singletary old and washed hes 26
Finally a video that isnt pre recorded like eternities prior. Still love ya papa. Prioritize that mental health.
MMG i love you but you are truly smoking that good shit if you dont think the bears take a QB pick 1. You're trading in a gamble for a new gamble sure but Williams as a prospect is significantly better than fields which is why they move on. They will probably get a decent pick out of him probably a third at least
The fact that so many players went to divisional rivals is crazy
Calls the Panthers trade a "smart" move but forgets that the Rams offered the Panthers 2 1st rd picks and the Panthers turned it down😂
W vid
As a Steelers fan I appreciate your comments on the whole Russell Wilson 👍
Cousins gonna be a thug after Atlanta
STEELERS COUNTRY LETS RIDEEE!!!
the whole reason for caleb to the bears is because do you waste the first overall pick when its handed to you and get a cheaper deal for 5 years or pay a midiocre QB that has flashes but also taking the chance on missing generational talent by skipping on Caleb
Need an update
Bro keeps skipping KTworshippers comments 😭😭
Joe to Texans
The falcons signed the ravens 3rd TE Charlie Kolar, they don’t want to use pitts
MEAGSSS LETS GOOOO NI-
don't hate on the niners for the Lance pick when we are paying our QB nothing #lovePurdy
Panthers traded cmc and Brian and got 0 round one picks out of that 😭
Wait til he sees Henry on the ravens
Cant wait for papa to see queen went to steelers😂 and we traded diontae😭
Brian Burns went to the Giants. Don’t know why it’s in franchise tagged, if nothing was set in stone.
broncos are cooked
They released Jones bc they couldn't pay him and he wouldn't take a pay cut
Can't wait for the "boys I have something to tell you" video again
Steelers got Patrick Queen
Jags be like I will give you a half a pack of gum for Mac jones
Go Birds 😊😊
I’m a packers fan and I’m happy with the pickups for us
What do u think about Henry to Baltimore and CJ GJ back to Eagles
Casual
1 hour gang
hopefully panthers get chase young
I am a packers fan you right 😂
Absolutely wild NFL Free Agency.
Henry to the ravens scary
Cj looking real good back in them Eagles uniforms
Where my Bengals at??? We doing gods work!
12:05 yes yes meags
At first the burns trade looks good for the panthers then you look back and see the turned down 2 1sts for him, 😬
So when the Vikings have kirk, Aaron jones, jj, Jordan Addison, and Hockenson, We are mid. But when Kirk moves to a team with a worse wr room, worse tight end and a sort of unproven rb, their team is the next coming of god? Nobody respects the Vikings ): love you though papa❤
Who's here after Henry gets signed to the ravens
ABSOLUTE FUCKING CINEMA
I wish Saquan well in the future, but as a Giants fan he is dead to me and many others
I knew Barkley was gonna leave us but to the eagles is crazy he’s dead to me now too
Wait till he sees Henry to the Ravens🤣🤣🤣
Wait till he finds out about henry
the ravens are looking into signing Derrick henry
Devin Singletary just put up his career high rushing yards??????????
Upload more nfl memes!!! GhettoGronk has done it again
The big thing with taking Caleb over Justin is resetting the pay clock. Justin would need an extension after this season, unless the Bears want to end up in a Dak situation. I don't think Fuelds has shown nearly enough for the Bears to consider signing him long term, so I think taking another qb and giving yourself more time to build the roster around the qb is a better move.
RAVENS GET THE KING RAHHH
im a giants fan and i want to die
1 hour club
Don’t forget Giants got a new QB
NFC north going crazy in FA
“I think the Steelers are gunna be good this year” Mmg actually said something good about the Steelers for once 😭😭😭
Derrick henry also signed with the Baltimore Ravens 😳
Derrick Henry ravens
Bro this shit wild.
Love these types of videos
This free agency is like MMG's career mode free agency
it’s nice to see matt using his brain
you missed CJ Gardner Johnson Signed with philly. So all yall haters be careful we got CJGJ, Saquon, Huff, Baun already. Eagles may have the one of the best offseason signings in the league good luck everybody else
Gotta love the coincidence of Matt yapping about Derrick Henry moments before the ravens sign him lmao
Jj to the chiefs incoming as a chifes fan 17 and 0
Meanwhile, Jerry Jones forgot about Free Agency while partying on his Yacht.
papa doesn't know henry went to the ravens😥
Wait till he finds out about the new best rb duo Henry and Jackson
8:23 "athletic josh allen"  💀
Every single grear running back is a free agent?????? Pollard Henry , Swift ,  Barkley , Ekeler  , Jones  , Jacobs and Mixon
Jones to Vikings 💪
Damar Hamlin to the hospital for free
I don’t think that the Cowboys know that this is happening
Honestly if the saquan signing never happened we would all be saying the eagles are falling apart
My raiders spelled damn hard with JJ
Just wait till we get a video on the Derrick Henry trade
Yo Derrick Henry to the ravens is crazy that offense about to be the best in the league cause now they got the tank and the speedster
I think Brian Burns signed with the Giants. Like a huge deal.
Bro people getting so heated in New York that’s a trash fanbase that’s for sure saying I hope you tear ur acl bro wth wrong with people
Singletary is younger than Barkley papa... smh
mmcasual :(
Ravens gets Derrick Henry Steelers get Patrick Queen Chargers get Gus Edwards Bengals get Geno Stone Patriots get Antonio Gibson Browns get Jameis Winston Texans get Hunter (from Vikings) and Joe Mixon  Panthers get Diontae Johnson  This Free Agency on Dr*gs

Saquon was very mid lol
I will dislike one push-up comment for every like this gets.
I know
Aaron Jones on the Packers was SOOOOO underrated
You know what I’m missing in my life? A cowboys fan to laugh at when the Cowboys do something stupid on a monthly basis.
I think that once you start bouncing around teams you become washed
Miami has signed 2 LBs now thank god
This genuinely could be the most star studded season of all time it has a built up draft class so many good teams like this could genuinely the the greatest season of all time
Howie is cooking this offseason. Just brought back CJ back where he belongs. Barkley is about to go off behind this offensive line.
Austin Ekler and Brian Robinson best rb duo (I'm A commanders fan btw)
Meags doesn't inform us on this, we're here for the amazing commentary and insite.
My commanders pick up 12 agents and still got 9 draft picks
Like to make I liked my own comment not the most liked comment
1 hour gang
As a panthers fan we have offense now but sacrificed our entire defense 😭
Signing washed saquan is crazy😂😂😂
Crazy
After seeing the Derrick Henry and the Dallas Cowboy talks for weeks and weeks you'd assume he'd be a Cowboy right? NOPE!!! JERRY JONES SAID WHAT HE WANTED WAS "TOO EXPENSIVE". SERIOUSLY?!?!?!? I hope the Cowboys go 0-17. I hate this team.
