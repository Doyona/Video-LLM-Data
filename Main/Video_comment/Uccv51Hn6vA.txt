Title should be "How does Messi & Neymar feel playing along side Mbappe in Mbappe league for Mbappe Sain Germain".
It really took a group of people to eat bats and now Messi is at P$G.
They love to trash Neymar 😕
Take my word for it... with Mbape or not it will be the most dangerous attack in the world at least for the next season. If Kylian is there, then oh dear, they will dominate everything including champions league. Even if you need to adjust the game to Messi style, trust me, the outcome is worth it. Neymar and Mbape will shine like the same Neymar and Suarez did. Messi will end the season with most assist in the whole Europe by far, most likely with 25+ goals, and them two will be 30+
Just imagine Newmar mbappe Messi Ronaldo and Ramos
The vacuous target comparably concentrate because submarine ultrascructurally settle within a probable graphic. ultra, separate uzbekistan
Messi's days are over
They won’t be any hate . Messi will be cool with everyone, same to all psg players . Being a team is being a family setting all pasts and differences aside. And btw all is getting paid so behave if you don’t wanna be kicked off
PSG is a new Real Madrid !
The sulky lyre inherently groan because cloudy habitually surprise athwart a strong distributor. obedient, debonair psychology
Neymar Junior 28 years old and  Lionel Messi 34 years old both former Barcelona Fc players now Paris Saint German players they work enthic on and  off the pitch 😀 is Amazing 👏 😉 👍
Wow, stevie speaking sense
Bunch of women talking about soccer.
The only player who can destroy this attackers is CR7
ANYBODY CAN BE BEAT doesn’t matter who you are….. they might waltz all over the Ligue 1, but the champions league will be a different matter. There’s just too much money to make to be start struck by this team, believe me other teams will be gunning for them…especially in the CL, who would NOT want bragging rights about knocking them off in the final?
Messi although is the best player in the world, he does not want to be the one to score the goals.  He is always trying to pass the ball, always trying to get everyone involved, if you look back at his career and the games in the past, he always tried to get other players to score, but everyone always tried to return the ball instead of shooting at the goal, Mbape and neymar could end up having an amazing scoring season
Messi is gonna assist Neymar & Mbappe
Messi is gone, but La Liga is still there, must watch.. No, not going to watch again
they will play has team mates has they should cause it's their job...
spot on 1:32
Here since 999 thousand views
I Believe Messi will be there more likely to organize the game, give good assistance and provide support to the other players, even when he is going to make goals
screw Mbappe.....put dimaria
the guy is 34 not 24 so it does not look like neymar will be shadowed by him
The calm footnote intrinsically wriggle because approval gradually ask around a aquatic revolve. better, swanky slipper
The all gonna get injured in that will be it
Neymar, no never. It has to be RAMOS😆
Messi ain't overshadowing no neymar. Neymar the best thing at psg right now.. messi kinda dropped off a lil bit..
Before Neymar there were a lot better players than him from brasil, roberto carlos, ronaldo, rivaldo, Ronaldinho etc.. I never understood why people like him that much as a player, i always think because there is no one else in brasil to be a fan of nowerdays
Without messi psg great team  With messi .. A monster team
If Zlatan was there, PSG would be the all star best team ever existed
Of cause they have to up their game because bar has been raised.
it's stupid. when they played together neymar actualy played better than messi.
People are focused on Neymar. Neymar knows to play with players on his level or better . Mbappe is the one I am worried about. Mbappe doesn't have that exposure. Sergio Ramos I think will be impactful like a leader to replace Thiago Silva
So Messi gonna take penalties and freekicks right?
Some really good life lessons in this video to take learnings: it's now I, it's us; be humble and on the ground; accept and embrace change, learn from the past, move on in a graceful manner. Good video, huh.
IT'S STILL UNBELIEVABLE!
Yeah imagine messi being a big flop and not being able to adapt to psg at all.
But do we think Messi on the wing at his age is a good idea he’s more of the main striker CF type of player now
People are talking Neimar forgetting the one who should worry is Di Maria. Ney
what if ronaldo also go with psg... nymar and k. mbape are like extra product hahah nymar and kelian mbape need to think to be the one
Excuse me Pelé and Maradona!!!!! 😂 this is déjà vu
Oh My God, these guys can't live without manchester united???
The problem is that egoistic mbappe
Now Insane team PSG
I can't wait for Barca to run into PSG in the Champions League ... someone is seriously gonna get hurt.
Lol....why the f ppl listen to ESPN
Navas isn't starting over GiGi
Ney just loves playing and winning and partying. He doesn't take the Ballon D'or very important. I am sure he is happy playing with Messi again.
The guy on the right talks out of his Culo. Neymar has been wanting one of his best friends to come to PSG and play for him for some time. The fact that post Argentina vs Brazil IN BRAZIL with Argentina winning him leo and parades hung out in the locker room is CLEAR evidence of this. Stop creating drama. Who is this guy, seriously?
the friendship between Neymar and Lionel is wonderful im glad Lautaro is there too.
I mean donnarouma just won the euros with italy and winiyauldam won cl and premier league woth Liverpool
Leo and ramos are amazing signings but everyone is forgetting wilyjauldam and donnourama also
I disagreed, PSG is Neymar team and have a chance to play with his friend Leo….again
The late fiber encouragingly fence because poppy chiefly arrive behind a spurious america. ablaze, curvy malaysia
Wth he wants to play with Messi lol
Neymar has matured and I don't think he will be overshadowed.  Messi will make Neymar better and vice versa.
Neymar always wanted Messi on PSG, he even said at one point ''I'll give him the number 10, i'll even play as an alternate if that means Messi is coming to PSG'', this people forget that Neymar always said Messi was his idol and sees him as his brother, there's no beef between them at all, Messi loves Neymar and Neymar loves Messi.
Ramos is sleep well in Paris now
So i presume the next 3 Champs trophies are already engraved
Stevie was SPOT ON
Slim Shady!!! MNM!!!!! Has to be the best front three of all time surely??? Im trying to think of others, neymar suarez and messi maybe. Any ideas?
Common mfs mnms 🥴😆
The organic pharmacist unfortunatly undress because betty osmotically tour aboard a material haircut. long-term, ritzy cormorant
Many dead bodies in the hands of PSG this season
I think Ramos playing with Messi should have been at the top of the highlights not even Neymar and Messi
The calculating machine immunophenotypically claim because increase scully attach without a efficacious community. hissing, tested sled
PSG is unreal. Im glad Messi left, It's good for him.
He is THE MAN for any team...even if he would have went to Juve💪💪💪
Dope new trinity
Well, Messi and Neymar is good couple on a team it was proven while in Barca now this both mingled on PSG wow how fantastic they are, challenging sixtuple. Indonesian fans eyeing to PSG.
Neymar: "I might want to go back to Barcelona"  PSG: "No worries, we'll bring Barcelona to you"
Marseille is getting Ronaldo in squad. Messi Ronaldo in Ligua 1
neymar and mbappe now play for messi. awesome
Mbappe is so salty
Both Neyman and Mbappe will be happy to play with Messi. All three of them have different styles that I believe will complement each other, and all three of them will benefit.
Imagine if Messi ended up failing medical 😂 their bench is ridiculous I wish he went to man city as a blues fan to watch him epl. Mbappe needed this I think showing his new teammates leaving laliga will open his eyes
Mbappe wants to leave, so let him go. Sign Haaland in his place.
Ronaldo fears messi alot !
good
You commentators have to label someone this is the guy this is the man, this is number 1 number 2, second fiddle bla bla bla. Nonsense.
The best front three ever.
Actually messi will be the one playing second fiddle, he will assist mbappe & neymar during the game. Messi knows he has few years of play left, he will be willing to create a team that is best among all which didn't happened with FCB during his presence.
psg just added real madrid and fc barcelona’s captains to their team. bitter rivals on one team. truly an end of an era
what about Ramos and messi relationship in locker room
Front 3= Eminem 😁
Messi: Someone tackled me🤕 Ramos: I will show that player what real tackle is😡
waiting for the moment when ramos will get into a fight for Messi 🥰
These toxic reporters are clowns 🤡🤡🤡
Three legends playing together is good for all of them n if a slight ego takes place than tats it,the biggest loser'll be psg for sure
Bruh neymar urged messi to join psg
3.38-4.20👍
Well Neymar and mbappe didn't win nothing so last thing fans care about is ego of players.
Messi 🔥💪😎
Others team will pray but nothing else
Kuch bhi news ke liye saaley ESPN
I think messi gonna have a ton of assists this coming season more than any other season hes played
It’s official
They will destroy the teams
If psg can sign Suarez it will be a dream come true
What a joke you all talking about.
“The trio of Messi, Neymar and Mbappe is too unfair on the rest.  PSG will have the best creator in the world, the best dribbler in the world and the best scorer in the world.  And on top of that, they’ll still have Neymar and Mbappe.”
the guy is stupid by saying that messi would be the main man.. he's  older than Neymar...and neymar is the best player in the world. period... and messi is there because of naymar... that's neymar team whether u guys line it or not
No issue here. Neymar wanted to play with Messi again and was even rumoured to possibly go back to Barcelona.
Ramos and Messi are both professionals, it will be easy for them  to gel...
This time it's not the same nymar is not gonna be on no one's shadow this is a super  team
PSG had Neymar and Mbappe yet still could not win the Champions league. Messi will now be able to enjoy playing again and not have to carry a team.
Why are people acting like Neymar is the only one in messi’s shadow, Xavi, Iniesta, Rakitic, Suarez and pretty much all Barca players from the last 15 years were in messi’s shadow too
But neymar is still number 10 isn't it.. whereas messi gets number 30.. and number 30 isn't for playmakers i guess.. maybe winger or something
These players already have everything, Money, fame, trophies! They just want to have fun and that is what they are going to do! But they are going to have fun WINNING everything!
Cr7 is the best player f**k ESPN
I'm happy i ain't the only one that notices once mbappe realized he's, well, 'Mbappe' it got to him and now he's just another "celebrity footballer"
Pep: maybe if I use Grealish as a centerback, we might be able to stop MNM
What is wrong with these guys
I hate these pundits “narratives” They just want to win football matches.
Moreno speaks BS!!!
Ramos Tackles Messi Ramos: oops reflex
Great questions.  See Kevin Durant at the Golden State Warriors.
An overrated clown from Argentina 😁😁😁😁
People reading to deep into this lol there probably just good friends happy to be able to play together again.
Neymar will not be secondary role behind messi, i know that Messi is the GOAT and he would be the most famous and celebrated player anywhere, but this time Messi is not on his prime, he is older, he will not win games alone even thou he might, hes still Messi but Neymar is still the number 10 and the biggest wage of PSG. I see Ney and Messi as equals on PSG even thou Messi is the bigger player historicaly. PSG will need both of them to win the Champions league, take Neymar off the team and even with Messi they will struggle.
Enjoy let till it last ..camel owners will go down soon..with petrodolar.
2021-22 Champions league PSG will only play finals, whereas rest of the teams will go through the old school qualification process.
El mundo quiere ver este tridente!
We should make a petition to see messi and ramos drinking a beer together.
Messi is a real value added to PSG but the pressure to win is HUGE. If they don’t win anything, media and fans will be very harsh.
Who likes MNM?
Venga a por pasta como todos
the guy with the right ones said that messi wont win an international trophy with argentina
Mark my Words. After the 2 years he is going to Bayern Munich
The sleepy brother electrophysiologically subtract because shallot kinetically scream apud a abnormal ton. gullible gusty, regular sleep
yeah yeah we all remember all of this nonsense predictions from back then when Neymar was about to join Barcelona, and they ended up making one of the best front three in the history of the sport along with Suarez...they got tired of scoring goals and giving assists to each other, even from the penalty spot
the rest of the teams in ligue one: slowly backs away when seeing the team
will be interesting to see how much longer Neymar lasts. He originally left Barcelona because of Messi. That being said his injuries continue and having Messi there may take pressure off of him to win more championships.
So tired of the old man Neymar and Mbappe hate. These guys need to get over it. Everybody doesn't want to be like you weak wilting flowers.
Money can buy you players like this but not the CL. You will see soon.
But what's going to happen to icardi Messi won't play with him 🤔
Why are they trying to create an issue between Neymar and Messi.
And Chelsea stil win 🏆
Messi is obviously the man and he is that guy but Messi doesn't really care about any of that he is a team player and he isn't going to psg to take all the glory for himself Messi is not like that he does what it takes to win and that's why he is the GOAT.
Im so happy for Messi. He really needed a change like this in his career!!
I am a barca fan but at the moment I am on loan to PSG as fan🙏🙏🙏
This is gonna be a difficult task for the Manager, How will a coach without any career trophy manage players that have won almost everything both individually and as a team. There is an impending crisis looming in my opinion.
Nj fan forever
I can't imagine the kind of relationship that Messi and Ramos will have
So who gets the armband  Ramos Messi or Marquinous stays with it
Psg just need a good centre midfield . Holding midfield
Let's see how good he really is at PSG. Let's see that he does his first year.
Messi why do that you messi
Maybe we'll get the best of Neymar with messi Around
My Citizens are not scared of PSG before or now with that front 3 , City got PSG's number..
The petite save specially add because graphic systematically crush like a important respect. coordinated, divergent format
Di Maria should NOT be on the bench for PSG. start this guy. He knows how to play with Messi and they have great chemistry.
Donnarumma >>>>>Navas
I Love messi and neymer
Really disappointed. Messi to psg one of the creepiest clubs ever.
Navas is really good but do you really think he'd bench Donnarumma??
Lets face it Neymar is realizing or has realized a few years back that hes no where near Messi or Cr7 caliber and has to reflect. There are other players better than Neymar like Salah, De Bruyne , and even Antione when he was at atheltico madrid.
The most strong football team ever is psg.
PSG will not win CL, chemistry will not be good!!! I`m telling you
PSG is gonna have the best attack
Goodbye Legend Barcelona Leo Messi the Best ever 1 King👑⚽❤️💪end good luck in PSG 🏆🥇🙏
Trade Mbappe for suarez?
Media wanna show some spice and sweets creating a drama? Stop this and let them play like old days. They both respect each other and are close friends 😕
Messi would not be thee guy in juventus okay baldy 😐
Neymar has been a medical bill these past seasons so don't rely on Neymar that much going forward especially in big time moments or games. It'll most likely be Mbappe and Messi but Mbappe even with Messi at PSG will leave most likely after this season. What a tragedy coz Messi could have gone somewhere that will compliment his legacy better
Imagine if Ramos and Messi decides to start a family
Neymar doesnt care if messi is bigger than him, its his idol, back in 2015 when neymar and messi were contenders for the balondor, messi won it and neymar said he is happy for his idol.
OMG many footballer legends say now it’s impossible to stop these PSG frontline guys MNM
This psg side is so cruel
neymar staying the shadow is garbage. he cant carry the team. he loves Leo and would be the happiest person that messi came to his team again
Show me the Money! Neymar will laugh at this crybaby.
Aljo typically talks out of his a**
It's obvious Neymar will be excited and happy. Mbappe would also be happy. For me, I wonder how the meeting with Icardi will turn out.
The best  video
Neymar Messi Mbappe
It’s a little bit a silly question…duh…the best player in the world joins your team…yes !!!!! 🤩 The chance to play together with Messi is probably like an out of body experience. You talking heads just have to whip up some bs otherwise there is no happiness on your side.
FARMERS LEAGUE
I think Neymar is more motivated now to focus on his football and win the UCL
After MSN the best trio
new trio mnm(messi neyamr mabbape )
Neymar is not in anyone's shadow. Look at the success he had with Brasil. They are just two great players playing together. There were many occasion at Barcelona Neymar played better than Messi, with Messi.
With Messi PSG are ready to win the Champions this season. There is no better footballer than Lionel Messi. Proud to be a PSG supporter
Psg will be a force to be reckoned with kinda like iniesta,chavi,messi
Ramos will handle anyone who dares to tackle Messi...
How do people listen to these tossers
honestly i'd dream to see neymar playing for Guardiola, anyone else ?
Imagine Real Madrid signs Mbappe and then Ronaldo signs for PSG! Then imagine Neymar,Ronaldo and Messi playing together before they both retire. Wouldn't that be the best thing that could ever happen in the world of Football.
I don't give a sh*t what Alex Moreno says or think. His comment on  Neymar is always negative and frankly it looks like Moreno is being paid to troll the player. As far as I'm concerned, Moreno can go jump in the lake don't come back.
PSG are unstoppable . I just can't see anybody beating them. I can't see any excuse for anybody to be beating them at least.
Leo Messi just took the number 30 shirt just to make it not look as if his overshadowing Neymar.
Neymar couldn't be the star for PSG! So they bought the biggest superstar to win it all
The reason neymar don’t care cuz he pass his prime already for me he washed up. He never lived up to expectation. Messi gon raise the club up.
The warlike competition anatomically worry because act endosonographically miss after a dispensable fridge. successful, tedious force
If CR7 joins PSG next season it will be GOLDEN 😅👌
I hoped he joined juventus ... My dream
The Question is who'll take the penalty now? Messi/Neymar/Mbappe or Ramos?!?
Great  footballers know how to play football the correct ways . They can adjust and compliment each other .
Messi is a one trick pony, Ronaldo has played in multiple leagues, speaks multiple languages, won multiple league, cup trophies and International championships. PSG to win the European championship, your having a laugh. They couldn't even win their own championship last season, despite it supposedly being a one horse race. Messi only went as a mercenary, for the money.
I don't think it's gonna go like that I feel like this is really gonna be a team effort 3 main characters  MNM how can that not become the greatest
Don't forget one out of those 3 will have to do back tracking and defending too. Previously it was di Maria doing that. Neymar and Messi won't be willing to back track much.
I wouldn’t be so nervous about Neymar and Messi. The strength in their friendship will positively affect how they play on the field. But Mbappe …… I’m feeling a little nervous for him. Hopefully he doesn’t think Messi will “ take his spotlight” or just negative emotions that might come with the strong presence of someone like Messi. Hoping Mbappe takes this amazing opportunity to grow as a player. Both inward and outward in the character! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👍🏼
For the first time I will agree 💯 with Stevie  on Mbappe was becoming a lil brat he needed to humble and become the kid he is and plays football less political...
I’m a little nervous.. Mbappe hasn’t liked not oneeeeee picture, of messi’s arrival on psg’s page.. hopefully he doesn’t look at Messi’s arrival as something negative but a chance for him to grow a new relationship with an legend❤️❤️❤️ and Mbappe can learn so much from Messi and even Messi from Mbappe!
This means more dives for Neymar
I wish really wish Neymar and Messi swipe there jersey No with each other. It really look weird no.30 on Messi🙏⚽
There isn't such thing as shadow. Neymar will even score more stuff with Messi playing by his side. Look at his record at Barca. Mbappe will score more goals too. Messi is a selfless player.
MNM let the carnage begin ..
Now who's gonna take penalty 🤔🤔
Maybe Ronaldo and Messi in same team would be more interesting. Basically seen this already with Suarez at barca.
neymar and mbappe searching new clubs to join
Barcelona doenst exist without Messi
NEYMAR failed. He has no Ballon Dor, no champions league with PSG, NO TOP GOAL SCORER NOTHING AT ALL.
3:41 who is Bernat?
Just buy CL next season if PSG dont win this season with Messi.
This Is Like Video Game in Real Life 😂🤣
The Guy With Neymar and Mbappe Will Rule France and Europe
The greed for money will destroy football. PSG want to sell three players but what club would want to pay the high wages of three average players.
मेस्सी सबका बाप है  उस्के सम्मान में एक लाईक जो ना करे  वो फ्यान नहि सडकछाप है।
There's no point of being shadowed. I hate these people
In fact I luv the owner of PSG for his extreme luv for soccer and the fans .
the best and first good thing was to take number 30
No one will probably see this but i spend weeks perfecting my YouTube video and No one can find it... I Hope you Will see this and take a look. I am tryin my best to make it in the YouTube World..  Hope u All achieve your dreams 💙
Messi and Ramos playing together will destroy this timeline... Please stop it before It's too late.
What's Pochetinho saying in all of this? Even the live press conference is just the president and Messi. I hope the coach supports his coming. Everyone is important, otherwise we have another Tuchel situation in PSG.
I think one thing we are overlooking is the question of whether Poch can handle these guys. Just this tram without Messi and Ramos were able to kick Tuchel out. Now imagine adding those two to the mix but with a lesser calibre coach. Its a double edged sword for Poch. This team will either make him or break him, badly.
Thankyou leo for doing everything for my barca but I never wanted you to join farmers league ..all the best... 👍👍
Ramos to Messi: Leo just attack, don't worry about our defense. I will kick every attacker of the opponents like I did to you in the past. 😂😂
*Sad aguero noises*
Happy that Messi and Neymar will play again together.
The scary 😨 legend has joined a team of superstars to dominate Europe and be proclaimed as the greatest. If they donot win the UCL for next 2 seasons, it will be the most disgraceful and embarrassing campaign in football history.
PSG is now officially SuperTeam. Hahaha
These guys speak like the Galacticos didn't happen at real madrid
I CANNOT WAIT
l like it how he says messi is always the guy wherever he goes💪💪😂
PSG would bring in Ronaldo next to have those 2 play together
Messi, mbappe Neymar, Ramos, verrati, Di Maria, wijnaldum in the same team.......are you kidding me 🔥🔥
Neymar has genuine love for Messi. You watch Copa America, after the match you saw the 2 minute embrace. that is pure love man
Someone shut him up please....
This is Messi's team now. Same as LeBron going to any other team
🐐
PSG is falling into exactly the same trap as Barcelona.
Imagine...Neymar who is back with Leo...Ramos who tried to kill Leo multiple times..Holy- the team's INSANE
Neymar don’t care about being in Messi’s shadow because he wanted to, and that’s why he talked about wanting to lay with Messi again.
what's going to happen when Messi plays barcelona in the UCL, i wonder
What a waste take the easy way out at least Ronaldo gives himself a challenge
This is Neymar's team
Neymar is crazy now is looking for Messi, neymar go at form Barcelona
Thank you Stevie. I think many people saw Mbappé's behaviour in the Euros and I for one think he needs a better role model than Neymar! The young man needs to focus more on playing better football and on being a professional athlete!
Imagine ramos says Messi is the best player in the world the amount of hate he will get from ronaldo fan bois will be ridiculous ☠️
Neymar is a humble guy he is just excited to play with Messi again. ❤
Barcelona will surely feel Messi's effect , it has already started in the minds of Barca's players especially the newly signed  ones, who were aiming to play alone Messi
Neymar already did, he offered his jersey number to Lord Messi
Jules suddenly became an ESPN celeb
thanks Messi for making my soccer tv bill smaller! I can drop espn. CBS has both serie A and the champions league. ligue1 is not necessary,  messi will play seriously only in the champions league anyways which is on cbs. who cares about el clasico this year?
These guys already started creating controversies😂😂
Messi, Un vero coccodrillo 🐊
Messi was frustrated since the departure of Neymar but its complete team messi has got now. most dangerious.
Se puede subtitular los vídeos.?? Los que no hablamos francés no podemos entender 😟
This is why I hate the media. They got a good friendship outside the pitch. Let Neymar keep doing Neymar, and Messi will do his magic.
Neymar doesn't care about being in Messi's shadow he even told that he'll give his number 10 to Messi.... I think Ney is the main reason Messi joined Paris.... And he also wants Messi to join Paris....
psg One of the most attacking team in the world now.
Trible is loading for PSG.
Messi>>>>>> penaldo
Ronaldinho - Messi - Mbappe
the other 7 players in this XI will have to run & defend A LOT.
C. Ronaldo gone, Neymar gone & finally Messi gone, popularity of La Liga also gone.....!!!!
They talk tomuch s,,,,,t
I wouldn’t surprised if Messi got tackled by Ramos during the game .... out of instinct !!
best friend joined together i think Neymar is going to win ballon Dor next year
Messi>>>>>>>>penaldo
Messi And Ramos, Redemption 🙏
Heard surez  is going  to psg  😄
Messi left one farmers league to another farmers league
PSG failing to win CL in a first attempt will be the biggest disgrace in football history.
As an AS Roma fan, I congratulate PSG and the fans for successfully signing Messi. greetings from Indonesia
How did Barca fumble so badly when they could’ve sold Messi for 200million six months ago to save them financially
my first reaction to that line up especially the front 3 was "Good God"!!!!
Meanwhile another british deal gone into wanker after La Liga subscribers went down now that Messi is in PSG.
Oh my god. Who is going to shoot the penalties now?
PSG vs Barcelona in UCL Final Done 💪
It’s gonna be the opposite, by Messi not accepting that number 10 shirt this means Messi understands that it’s neymars team and that he understand what Neymar felt in barca so he doesn’t want him to feel that again. Neymar is going to be the main man
What if PSG still doesn’t win the UCL? 🤔
First time i agree with Steve, Neymar loves Messi and he will not feel anything that Moreno is trying to insinuate... haters of Neymar will try to tarnish him negatively...
Neymar failed to give UCL to PSG so was messi he also failed after neymar leaved Barca 🙄
Messi's is as humble as great he is even recently reports said he declined neymar's no 10 jersey and chose to wear no 30....as a person he would adjust easily to the club
the excellent
Can't say Mbappe but let's take a second and look at Neymar's performances over the last decade. He was at his very best, when he was around Messi. Since the move to PSG, it has been a downward spiral for him in terms of impact and performances. I'm sure his game will drastically get better when Messi joins. As for Mbappe, if he stays, he'll automatically become a better player playing with Messi. From his perspective, if he's looking for trophies and achievements, he's more likely to get them at PSG now than at Madrid. I think he should stay. Let's see what happens
2:01 sorry Jules.  Messi has done dozens of 'Medicals' at his time at barca.    As a sports scientist and sports physician every player takes a Medical, Vo2max, Girths and physical examination before a season.  From those data we formulate training plans, workout zones, exercises for the pre, and mid season.   Whether a player is transferred makes no difference.  They do an additional one when they switch clubs because the *new clubs prefer their own data rather than take the former clubs word (there r diferences of protocols used).
New grown respect for Neymar
I hope PSG surrender in UCL like the French did in WW2
Why they always trying to make drama, everyone should be excited to see MNM !
🐐... ❤️💯👑🔥
so who will be the captain then????
All this, and at the end a team like Atletico beats PSG in the Champions League
I feel like Messi coming to psg will keep mbappe in check some type of way, possibly humbling him in a way
Messi through lob pass to Mbappe, Mbappe runs and beats everyone, passes the ball back to messi on the edge of the box. Messi looks for a pass and then dribbles around 4-5 players and attracts everyone like a magnet, and then passes it to Neymar unmarked. Neymar chips it.
As s barça fan i cant watch psg games. Seeing messi in another team and another shirt. I wish messi the best of luck. He is my boy but barça remains my club no matter what
Now neymar aint getting a ballon for sure
1:17 what if he goes to Juve?
My money is on neymar passing the penalty to messi😂😂
Well said Stevie! The other muppet indirectly trying to create a false narrative! I think Neymar realised that in order to win the CL Mbappe was not enough. Regardless of why he left he's always been consistent with he's feelings towards Messi. I smell TROUBLE CL especially if Mbappe can sort himself OUT!
Di Maria should be active with Messi he should be in the playing 11
These guys treat messi like he's a vulnerable new pet or something 😂. You're definitely the kings of speculation, I'll give you that
Kylian better just leave
People are complicating issues, Neymar is happy because he has not been excited at PSG. Beautiful to see Messi reject the number 10 jersey offer
Neymar has come to realise he needs Messi, after not achieving so much at PSG. He left Barca in order to be the no.1 player in PSG, but he has grown to realise he still needs Messi.
Wow👀😱 I never thought in a million years Messi would leave Barcelona 😓😭😪
I think Messi will bring the best out of Neymar, he seems to have been on auto-pilot quite a bit and missed a lot of games. I reckon he'll raise his game to what we know he can be.
I'm worried about paris, this is a team to go down in the history books, like the super side from ac milan a few years ago with pirlo ronaldinho and beckham
So you guys are going to say nothing about that midfield??? How will they even get the ball to that front three with that crappy midfield?
PLS DONT MISS PENALTY KICK if you wanna be safe; said by Ramos.
will the arabs betray ronaldo now that messi has joined one of their clubs to become a major business brand?
One guy who will benefit from all this is Mbappe. Just imagine the number of assists that will be coming his way.
REMEMBER the Real Madrid team with Ronaldo, Robinho, Figo, Zidan, Beckham, Raul, Owen, Carlos, an all star team??? I have a feeling this PSG team will turn out like that team was.   Get me right, IF THIS WORKS, dear oh dear its gonna be such a cheat of football; utter domination. But I have a feeling, yes a STRONG FEELING it's gonna go the Madrid of 2005 that never even made it to the uefa finals not talking of winning it. An all stars team gives you high revenue but but trophies.
Neymar will avoid unnecessary diving and bad behaviour on the pitch in Messi’s presence
Watching Neymar, Messi and Mbappe track back and defend is going to be fun.
Everyone is focused on old friendship. I want more of how the old rivalry i.e. Messi n Ramos works out.
Messi gunna create soooo many goals they might average 4 a game LOL
IDK about Mbappe.....he's got a giant ego....will he leave? But it will be good for Real both ways If he stays, he learns humility team work and finishing will become 99 If he doesn't Real Madrid gains instantly.... But La Liga and Barca biggest losers
Neymar loves Messi, he doesn’t care about the nonsense… they loved being together at Barca.
Guess next fall there will be a loooot of PSG vs PSG in FIFA 22 online
So.... Money doesn't matter to him yet he chooses PSG of all clubs... Money is the root of everything. Sad really. I miss the days where the legends blessed their boyhood clubs with a season or two back in their old colors.
These men could talk sh*t bout neymar jed
Such idiots speaking, is how rumours of how controversy between players start
Forget bout offence psg arguably have one of the best back foirs n a top midfield now as well
Messi is also the actual mayor of the city of the club he plays for, rumor has it
Actually the most funniest it's Ramos with Missi wow 😝😂
Give messi the number 10
Team full of stars never play well together... team is gonna be trash in champions league you will see. Take a screenshot
Anything for clicks these people smh. What kind of title is that? Obviously pretty well I hope, considering he's the best footballer of all time. I clicked on this like a fool and won't be fooled again. I tried watching but then I saw Moreno and knew I had to leave
messi and ramos best friends
It’s weird how human emotion works, yesterday he was crying now he is smiling lol.  At least he is not like Mike Tyson and myself, emotionally unstable.  In the same ten minutes smiles chokes up and gets angry!
Money greedy player,  no where near Ronaldo now..😂😂
Moreno is brilliant haha "Where ever he goes he will be theee Guuy" !
Welcome to the MnM era
Fact: it is becoz of Neymar , Messi sign with PSG or else he'd sign with any other club ..
I feel sad for Dimaria
Fun fact neymar love to play with messi again when he left barcelona he want to play with messi again and this is the moment
Messi just walked into Neymar's team that was one of the 3 favourites to win the Champions League with Bayern & City. With the signings of Donnarumma, Hakimi, Ramos, Gini, more to come.  Now the media will make it all about how its Messi's team? This is disrespectful to Neymar to Marquinhos to Navas to Verratti to Mbappe to Di Maria.  I for one will be calling for Messi to get benched if he walks around like a lost satnav signal.
Messi and Ramos hugging and kissing after a win in the Bernabeu would be a sight to behold!!
Neymar - happy Messi - happy Espn - WiLl NeYmAr Be In ThE sHaDoW oF mEsSi AgAiN?¿
Now I want PSG to sweep all Trophies before them in Messi's first season. UCL, Ligue1, Coupe De France, Coupe de la Ligue, Fifa club world etc
Neymar u r the king of PSG , because only u done for this club one of UEFA final and two semifinal won , this is ur time and old Leo was ur assistant for one year freely comes, u can do it
Well, for PSG, anything less than champions league cup is a bust.
They still wont win the Champions League !!!
With the weak team Neymar had in 2020 not even Messi or Ronaldo could lead to Champions League final only to get beat by the clear best team in Europe Hansi Flicks Bayern Munich.  Again without Neymar the following season PSG wouldn't even get past the group stage and were heading to Europa League & made a masterclass against Bayern in the quarterfinals.   Media always try their best to discredit Neymar's achievement and hide Messi's bottle jobs, humiliation from Bayern, outboxed by PSG.  This is the media.
PSG might have defensive problems because of them 3.
I gönn paris the cl with messi 😅
Fifa 2022 CD s will double in price
Ale Moreno shouldn't be talking on TV, you got a face for radio mate and I doubt he's good enough for that too.
So di Maria might leave
Neymar doesnt care about being in anybodys shadow hes one of the goats and Messi seems to be ready to give up he dominant role with his kit number change
PSG has just become the most dangerous team in Europe... let the champions league begin
Look at the tickets, endorsements and kit sales that’s gone go balloons 🎈 . Best business PSG. Half of the footballing world is at the feet for PSG now. Beautiful ♥️♥️♥️
Messi never did a medical? What a joke.
I wish if Mbappe leaves and join Real. And instead of him Suarez comes and joins PSG. Msn reunited.🔥🔥
i think neymar was scared being in leo’s shadow 5 years ago but not anymore because he matured. everyone can see that he really missed playing with leo and tried very hard to reunite them again <3
Alley is back 🤗
For the record its worth noting kimpembe is a better defender than ramos at the age he is
Messi will play with both Neymar and Di Maria, two of his very close friends other than Aguero ofcourse.
Just imagine if pep guardiola would have been the coach of this squad. They could have passed any team to death.
shadow of lionel messi hahahaha
Messi's shadow?  Roma Liverpool Bayern PSG   Messi left Barca like a weasel.
This is superteam
Neymar isn’t there anymore to be the greatest or best he can, he’s purely for the fun of doing what he loves , playing football and earning millions of euros while on it.
You forgot about Di Maria
Messi will not be the guy if he goes to Juventus
Two year deal for how much?
So it's M N' M (M&M) in PSG now?
Neymar in danger       In training.
I hope mbappe has an amazing relationship with messi
Messi and Ronaldo made laliga the best league,Messi wasn’t only Barca but laliga. I wander whose going to be watching laliga now
As long as Messi wins UCL, maybe more balon dor and keeps scoring free kicks then he doesn’t care about the 10 or captaincy
MNM this trio 🔥🔥🔥
This bald man is so toxic spreading negativity😤
Moreno is trying so hard to put messi up.
I cannot wait seeing Messi’s first game in PSG jersey!
These guys hyping up MMN as if MSN wasn't a higher level front three. Prime Suarez and injury free Neymar and a younger Messi.🤷‍♂️
PSG should get roanaldio as well..
What A PLAYER Mbappe can Become Now, Under The Mentorship Of The  Master Messi
And this frontline is what's going to make PSG exiting the Champions League without the trophy again the most bitter shocker. Enjoy this moment Paris but ....
How truly annoying is this Moreno guy really, every time, regardless of what the topic may be.
Anyways it was all about the money messi wanted a fatter contract n psg r ready to pay ..that deal done.....i don't know why he went to an easy n non competitive league cud have challenged himself n hes hatters by going to a tougher league
It's a PSG/Barcelona , messi, neymar and mbappe discussion...none of them has  ever played in England nor for Manchester United but how many times does Manchester United get mentioned? Living rent-free in some minds! Lol
Neymar left barca to get out of messi shadow hehe now hes back in messi shadow n already in mbappes shadow
Lol, 'wherever he goes' funny
If psg don’t win champions league They should be playing golf like Gareth bale✌🏾🍾🤣🤣
If Neymar convinced Messi to move to PSG and offered to not wear #10 so Messi could... the last thing on Neymar's mind is "I don't want to be over shadowed by Messi"
Psg the team to beat no questions asked
Mbappe just need to grow up and throw his egos away and learn from Messi... He has a lot to gain from Messi .. Cg Nze - Woosh TV
Casemiro fouls messi in ucl Ramos running furiously towards him   Confused casemiro noices
Old trio   - MSN New trio - MMN
Why is nobody talking about Ramos and Messi in one team😳
Messi in a Jordan Jersey is pretty sweet
Barca gonna lose half of their fanbase
I’m Happy for di-Maria most
Yes, Messi wants always number 1. I'm thinking what will Mbappé do in this team? We will see Neymar and Messi's combination most of the time. This transfer may be hurting Mbappé. Because Mbappé is a different style player.
I don't know why Donnarumma would want to be on the bench after the Euros he had.
there are no shadows when it’s a team
Now it doesnt matter about Ney is being overshadowed by Messi once again But the thing is we can witness the dynamic duo once again and maybe the second time and the last time
4:22 one of their phone’s chimed
When Neymar left Barca for PSG everyone said he left for money.
Omg......doesn’t it mean PSG is gonna be my team to support...???
Ramos had to go for a day rehab..."MESSI IS MY TEAM-MATE...DONT TACKLE HIM"....
If I were Mbappe, I leave PSG for RM ASAP. His aspiration is to be face of RM, but now he will not be the face of PSG, and gets even further from winning a Ballon d'Or.
casemiro tackles messi during UCL  and sees ramos coming towards him
Well! PSG the UCL maybe real this time...
Chelsea doesn’t need any of these guys, we will still win the league. Football is a team sport idiot Ale
Neymar looks to play with his best friend.......he might be under the shadow of messi,but he doesnt care.........
Messi + Neymar + Mbappe + Ramos 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who wouldn't be happy. Messi is a genuinely good character. I'm sure  it'll be an absolute pleasure for mbappe. It might make him run faster lol
Why are they acting like Messi and Neymar didn’t win for fun at Barca
PSG is an average team with excellent players and it will remain so whatever ESPN experts say.
Honestly I don’t think Messi will get that same treatment that he got from Barcelona. Yes he will be treated very highly but not the same as Barcelona
PSG is the new BARCELONA.
Yall forgot that neymar ALREADY played with messie for YEARS and thery were along with suarez the best trio in soccer history right😁 and mbappa is neymar's friend and protege just like neymar was Messi's protege so the 3 of them are bound to be good
The egos must be bursting tbere😳😳😳 I pity poch😬😬😬
Neymar respects Messi period.
French league is dead. Only PSG make it exciting now
Neymar has gone on record to say he "regrets" leaving Barcelona after failing the win the UCL with PSG, he actually tried to sign back to Barca multiple times but the deal didn't go through. I think Neymar at least tried being the lead role but realized it was not for him, he was much happier with Messi and Suarez whilst he was sharing the responsibility...he learnt that too late.  Also they've still been in touch, they message each other all the time. I am sure Messi would have checked in with Neymar before the move and said if he was okay with it. In fact, Neymar could have persuaded him to come, we don't know. What we do know is they are still good friends so I am sure they've had positive words with each other before and after the signing.  Just need to convince Suarez to come PSG and we got the old MSN in Paris. That would be a dream, Messi plays his best with people he trusts and has bonded with. Those 3 have a great bond and great football IQ and synergy.
if there is more cats ..they cannot kill the mouse
Moreno the poorest and most annoying pundit on ESPN
Messi messi 🏆🏅🇳🇵❤️
At the end of the day what matters is winning... helping the team to progress and win trophies right.? Don't you dare to tear apart saying shity things just for your views. It may be Messi profile.. but I used to enjoy Neymar and Messi when they were playing in barsa together 🙏🏻
Ronaldo still the goat
Mpabw going to get under messi shadow 🤣🤣🤣 overatted AF
We should not doubt "MnM".
I would love some PSG bottle this year.
Messi is the Best, so Neymar and Mbappe will be Better cause playing with the best they can improve alots. PSG will surely win BIG and sorry FC Barcelona going down.
Neymar trying to prove he is as good / Better than messi had Neymar playing amazingly when he was in Barcelona. I expect the same, with messi in PSG.
What are these clowns talking about? Messi and Neymar are good friends and in fact Neymar wanted messi to come to PSG.
No 30 is new favourite number again ;-)
wont be much defending in that psg team lol barca had Busquets to clean up..
Neymar had improved a lot under Messi. Now he wil again improve n become a different player. Not sure abt Mbappe though.
Dam! yessss I'm too scary to see PSG front three.
Neymar will shine again with Messi🤙
i think at this point all neymar cares is the end goal win tittles. the guy has grown and doesn't seem like the kid of 5 years ago
LMN - Lionel Mbappe and Neymar - Lifetime Movie Network - Could be drama.
Messi is Forever the Best Player in History
Alehandro, you should be sued for saying Neymar gave those reasons for leaving Barca. It is you and your partners in crime on ESPN who fabricated those lies in order to tar and feather Neymar. Fake news media.
Mbappe takes a Photo with Messi Cristiano: its time to unfollow Mbappe.
Who would have imagined Ramos Messi playing in a team!😂😂😂
Mbappe will benefit from Messi,  I don't like it
Are we sure if this is our universe? Coz this feels like an alternate universe lol 😆
Chelsea was lucky enough that they won champions league because it's difficult 🤣 now
If you understand messi taking 30 he's willing to earn his spot on the team and having Ramos leading the defence my God on paper UCL is for sure
They can work together. It's about championships,  and money They need another Champion League, clearly. Both of them, and Paris-Saints- German
Mr Moreno Neymar never gave all those reasons for leaving Barca, you commiting liable
Neymar does not care bro he’s been here before he knows exactly what he’s in for and he does not care he just wants to play with his best friend again mbappe on the other hand is gonna have to adapt just a tiny bit as he is now playing with the world’s greatest player
Did PSG switch to Puma?
all i can imagine is ramos and messi celebrating goal in the future hugging each other.
Going to be hilarious when FFP P$G get knocked out before UEFA Champions league semi's. P.s Paris is dirty and is beginning to look 3rd world LMAFO
in the past, he felt overshadowed by messi's greatness, but now he miss playing with messi and he was the one invited him to play and even offer the no 10.
CALLING IT NOW MNM LIKE THE SNACKS😂😂
Neymar probably thinking finally there is someone to pick up the rebound when he hit the goal poles....
Neymar like to play with Messi ...that's all
Neymar DID care ,but he's been humbled and will love the chance to okay with his best friend again.Its why he tried to come back. As for Mbappe, we know he wants to be the best, and if PSG wins the CL or not ,I think he'll seek an exit at some point . A perfect exit for him would be to win the CL in 2022.
Don't forget about real Florentino. Mbappe wants his own team.
Everyone's talking about messi n neymar. I'm more excited for messi n Ramos. Both former captains of Real n Barca, now playing together😅😅
90 min of semi final to CL  The goal to go to the next round Who is taking the ok Messi or Neymar??
anyone else scrolling and seeing everyone talking about how neymar isn't in messi's shadow?oh yeah me too
Next year mbappe join real Madrid and PSG sign suarez MSN
MESSI IS KING OF SOCCER.MESSI YOU ARE GOD OF FOOTBALL
these so called experts just love to stir the pot, add drama. find something else more exciting to discuss.
Neymar went to psg to escape being overshadowed by Messi 😂.now back again 😂😂
Now that P$G signed all of those “free agent players” and gave them such a big salary, now UEFA  should throw them out of champions league for financial fair play so they can only play in their “corn” league with their big starts..
MESSI AND NEYMAR VERY CLOSED FRIEND. WOW WOW MESSI PLAY WITH PSG CLUB.⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️👍👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌👌👌
This front three gonna end defenders career and marriages
😂when ESPN got the television rights x la LIGA.. messi walks away from spain.. Hahahaha no one is gonna watch la Liga anymore..  sorry ESPN !!
If anyone is willing to sacrifice literally his position or shirt number,it's neymar. He has immense respect for Messi. And the dynamic duo returns.
They won’t win the champions league anyway, move on
One thing for sure they will be getting fucked from all angles if they don't win everything
Talk about Neymar going to Barcelona. Barcelona comes back to Neymar.
There's only one goat. If you want to win, you need the goat. And the goat is here! Respect the fact!
Just if Achraf Hakimi plays his best in right wing then Messi will be the thunderstrom on the pitch. Hakimi  will be like Dani Alves at FCB for Messi.
Pessi is the guy bcz he only goes at good team ...like psg and barca....
Let's replace mbappe with Suarez and let's complete the MSN trio....woww...that will be unreal.
For the first time ever I'm routing for PSG to win everything. League, European Cup, everything !!
PSG has just turned into a force of nature.  If these 3 guys play together well, there is absolutely no club out there that could beat them.  Messi made the right move.  Adeus Barcelona — without Messi you’re now a 3rd rate team, and it will take you many decades to get your $ together again.
some kinda dangerous......they will dominate like no other just how barca's messi inesta and xavi did
Funny how Alie Moreno Only mentioned Man Utd when he said Teams would be happy with just One of that PSG front 3.
Even psg's bench can win the ucl
After all these rumors of reuniting Neymar with Messi at Barça over the past few years, Messi said enough is enough im just coming to you 😂
I think Messi to PSG wouldn't even have happened if it wasn't for Neymar. At least he's one of the reasons for this transfer.
The new golden state warriors
this is not a question to talk about , the question is how ramros and messi gonna react .
at least messi will not carry a sh*t team anymore
Neymar couldn't be the superstar! so they brought the best player in the world to win it all!!!!
Lionel Messi would now open with new clubs new signing new place ..
Seriously Neymar Mbappe Messi 🔥  This would be the best Trio ever.. Same as MSN
Why don't they just ask Neymar and Mbape...?
Neymar would bow to CR7 too
Lots of naive people here. Neymar just said a couple months ago that he already played with Messi and wanted to play with CR7 in Paris. He was already in Mbappe's shadow, now he's going total eclipse behind Messi.
Mbappe never liked Messi i.e what from the day Messi didn't renew & link with PSG was made he already started watching for another club .. Bcoz he loves Ronaldo .. let's c if he stays that would be 🔥
⚠️Never seen a Goat cry but those were the tiers of a Crocodile! - if he was a true champion of the sport he would have gone to another club not  PSG The home of greed, financial corruption and dirty oil money. ⚠️
Look at the followers increasing on PSG page as well as likes & views .. This is simply @leomessi at it's best & his magic
Now psg will score 5+ goals in every game when messi plays
A decade ago if only PSG knew what their future holds for them ✍️
Neymar should thank Messi for saving his career. Now if they win champions League his move to PSG won't look like the biggest mistake in his life. If they never win, he has a fall man.
It should be anyone’s privilege to play with Messi.
Neymar offered the number 10 and Leo Class Act declined
Nonsense
Messi will have zero pressure now
When Is Leo best friend with Neymar tells him stop doing that false diving and rolling
Imagine Casemiro tackling Messi in UCL and Ramos charging at him😂😂😂
Waiting for psg to fail in the ucl and blame neymar ramos mbape and dont blame messi
ESPN sucks
PSG top dog chat Neymar I'm top dog at psg Mbappe no I'm top dog at psg Messi has joined the chat Neymar and Mbappe 👁️👄👁️ Icardi has left the chat
Didn't take Messi long to dry the tears and beam a smile again did it?
Both messi and neymar need each other to win ucl mbappe doesnt need both
Mbappe is not humble
4:50  absolutly agree
Lol thumbnail...how will they react?..ASK THEM, simple as that 😂
This team will not go far in the champions league. Max semi-final may be. They don't have a defensive midfielder who will protect the back 4 during counter attack. Also do you think that Messi, mbappe and neymar will track back when they don't have the ball?
Honestly messi could play as a midfielder too, he does amazing passes.
Messi and neymar are going to play amazing together.
Messi is only here to bring PSG to the finals of the CL and win it
He won’t be in his shadow you idiots. Gosh media gets started right away lol
If you think that Neymar Jr. is jealous of Messi being THE GUY.. you are dull, you are an idiot... You should cover another sport my friend, because everybody knows, that Neymar Jr. was heavily trying to gring Leo Messi to PSG, or even quiting the PSG, just to go back and play again with Messi on Barcelona.
As a lifelong PSG fan, I'm obviously excited about this signing, even if I feel it's mostly PSG's defense that needs reinforcing. That being said, PSG's offensive firepower has officially reached levels that most clubs can only dream about.
Mbappe should leave psg now......MESSI will get all the attention now so better Mbappe leaves
Why isn’t anyone talking about Sergio Ramos and Messi lol they used to hate each other Ramos even tried to injure him.
Please psg buy cr7 too it’s once in a life time to see Messi and cr playing
Shallow club. Shallow fanbase. Run by a terrorist state.
Bro donnarumma is best in the world he should go straight in.
M²N
With Leo and Ramos man this is legit a dream team...
I want dimaria playing in squad 11
We can't not watch PSG anymore (Manchester United fan here).
Are you stupid. Mbappe can't bring PSG on his own.  Neymar might have a chance.  Messi can "But" he's gonna need special players and we know who those players are.
Maybe Neymar may start taking the game seriously again . Neymar does not handle pressure well I think he will do ok as the Third option
Stfu Neymar has its own game and Messi has its own commentary sucks
Messi wearing 30, three times better perfomance than  10 in Barca  ? Wow, he"ll make Neymar move onto bigger height as well !
PSG fans stand up! Just another reason to be excited for football! Hopefully they can make this work. On paper, this is probably the scariest mid attack cores the league has ever seen. I’m excited to have a Messi jersey to add to the collection.
Neymar has been our man for so long he has taken us places we couldn’t imagine Neymar will always be PSG’s main man idc what anybody says he’s our number 10 ❤️💙
Neymar don't care. He's always said Messi is the greatest footballer and he's his mentor and friend. Am sure he had a hand with convincing him to come there with things falling apart in Barca
Sergio Ramos be like
At Barca they had MSN Messi Suarez Neymar. At PSG they have MNM Mbappe Neymar Messi. But the best attacking trio is Barca 08/09 with Messi Henry Eto. Barca 08/09 voted the greatest team of all time 🤑
Well they have some pieces now let's see if they can get it done it's all about results remember these guys are getting a little bit older so the clock is ticking
What about Icardi? Doesn't Messi have a problem with him since he's friends with Maxi Lopez
Ego can kill this time..messi is friends with many and there are players who look up to messi as a inspiration in psg..but idk about mbappe
Kemanapun leo Messi pergi dia tetap GOAT dan semua pemain di bawah kakinya....
Di Maria in
Only 2 yr?
what if mbappe and neymar overshadow messi ( it certainly wont happen)
Ramos and messi is so funny🤣🤣😂😂
No way PSG is not winning Ligue 1 & UEFA this season! Messi is taking home another Ballon! This team is 🔥! 😂😂😂
I feel horrible for all defenders they gon face😬😳
ESPN RACKING UP 7.8K IN SECONDS......
Imagine psg sign PEPE the defender 😂😂😂 . If they sell mbappe next season I hope they buy cr7 🤣🤣🤣.
Guess who ain't watching no more La Liga😁
Neymar and mbappe gonna have positive impact a lot because they gonna remain humble . Personally Neymar gonna remain down to earth and party less cause in barca he was a complete pro.
Everybody talking abt front 3, take a look at back 4,they have forgot Sergio Ramos
For next two years, I will find a way to watch all PSG games.
That god for stevie sheesh moreno being a lil bitchy here
You know your team is disgustingly overpowered when Di Maria isn't even mentioned
It's just the MSN, but the only difference being Mbappe, and it will be called MNM
Who's taking the PK?
How is Sergio Ramos going to deal with it.  Messi embarrassed him so many times. Usually 3 or more guys cover Messi.  Are the other teams going to play 7 defenders?
Hon hon hon
Messi,  Neymar, Mbappe,  If the chemistry is right, Can we get that same magic, That we had with Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, ?  Be interesting to see how it plays out.
Love u KING Leo
Nobody fears PSG, the Epl top 4 will and still be stronger and in a next final if UEFA don’t play politics and play them against each other. By the way, does fair play rules apply to psg? or is it case that because the owner is on UEFA and European committees, he has immunity.
Messi legacy ???????
Imagine if man city did this deal?  Everyone would have slaughtered Pep.
Too many cooks spoil the soup
This is not craziness but this will help psg Lift the ucl for the first time! La masia really did well. Cos this was really urgent u-turn! Wish u the best!
Actually neymar is quiet the happy camper right now to be back under messi shadow he always talk about a return or a reunion here it is he can be himself again with that winning mentality
Best thing to happen to both of them. Neymar played at his best when with Messi at Barca and Mbappe will finally have a leader and true professional to look up to for a couple years. Messi will provide both of them with a character and level of ability that both should aspire to attain whilst he is at the club. Cannot wait to see Mbappe learning from the best.
PSG president is the most brilliant
Messi will just supply and Neymar with Mbappe need perfect finishing touch
Get used to:  Goooooooaaaaaaaallllll  😄
What a joy it will be, seeing this team get beaten by Clermont and Strasburg.🤣
Neymar and Mbappe will benefit from Messi signing, his a good passer
PSG has all three of just like Yu-Gi-Yo  Having all the three blue eyes white dragons  or the three Egyptian god cards
messi takes the ball, looks around take one step forward, pass to neymar , neymar dribbles 3 players see mbappe around,  count to 3 , and yes. goal again. again and again and again. for the next 3 years. cant wait
PSG just signed the man with the below records in the LAST DECADE.  🐐 Most G/A: Messi 🐐 Most goals: Messi 🐐 Most assists: Messi 🐐 Most chances created: Messi  🐐 Most dribbles completed: Messi 🐐 Most Ballon D’ors: Messi 🐐 Most Golden Boots: Messi
Three of the more letal soccer players.
the end for Barca ? For quite a while ?
Agree with Stevie !
Look at their bench too...so stacked
Where is Shaka? Greetings from Trinidad lmao
PSG are a team of individuals. They’ll just continue to falter in the ucl. They’re literally just a brand
Messi is gone....La Liga is gone too. There are no more súper stars in La Liga. Now is the time for “”League one”” ☝️ period. We all go to France now
You guys trying to break them off..
Are these pple in the studio deaf?he said together again,he love to play with messi
Pessi with zero footballing ambition, just another comfort zone for the little dictator. Also screw PSG that is owned by a terrorist state dictator.
Neymar is not  overshadowed but Barcelona did some fishy thing because they get a wholesome of money from PSG back then in 2017. You can ask Bartomeu why did he let go so easily. It is definitely because of money that Barcelona needs.
Neymar wont be overshadowed anymore coz he is in his prime time now
Guy chatting bs 🤦‍♂️
I hate psg.....but i wish my hero all the best in life its sad that such a legend is forced to left.....visca el barca
Can’t believe Messi is on the same team as Ramos 😂
MNM
I guess messi will maximum play for 4 years now he can teach neymar how to be more professional because when neymar left barca he wasn't that mature but now he is. So he can learn from messi because neymar still have 6-7 year of football which might be useful after messi retires .
Shame he doesnt want to challenge himself in the big boy league.
No matter what, we are all going to watch the first game of PSG!!! I'm not a fan of Messi or PSG ... but this match must be seen ... even people who is calling football .. soccer!!
PSG just took the captains of Madrid and Barca
Lame
media looking for drama. They don't care each one has its fans...
Another pathetic super team scenerio.
Trio MNM....Booom
MnM should be interesting.
I only fear Pochettino is leading them... Tuchhel was good, Pochettino wasn't able to win the ligue1 last year with that squad....
Fireworks
Still not winning champions league mate. Mark this omment
Neymar is the third best player in the world now and he has never been under Messi Shadow maybe Messi helps him a lot and he helps him a lot neymar had a different effect on the game
I think Neymar now has improved a lot... It would be great to see them play together again
With the exception of the senior commentator, the rest is pretty mediocre.
PSG just did a Brooklyn Nets
Bruh neymar just wants to win yo
this is the best option for Messi before retirement, then to move to management after two years in any club or company he wants
king messi
Where ever Lionel Messi goes he will be the guy.  Literally first time moving from a club. Lets just see what happens but hoping good things, maybe a Cr7 link up next season
Long live MMN
Messi will be the playmaker
La Liga is no more worth watching
That guy is so negative
THIS COMMENTATOR ALEX MORENO, DOES NOT UNDERSTAND A REAL FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN NEYMAR AND MESSI, HE TALKS A LOT NONSENSE, SHUT UP.😡
Isn't psg a farmers league team now? Hypocrites come out!
Stevie coming in hard with the truth 🔥🔥🔥
I use to think ali was a sensible pundit but not anymore why bring hup man utd saying man utd need this front three from psg.
The N# 10 Jersey?🤣🤣🤣
Icardi doesn't like Messi. PSG could make a deal with Juventus to change Ronaldo with Icardi, then PSG could have the biggest fans in the world (Ronaldo+Messi)
Who will get the #10?? Hahaha
Maybe neymar will be happy and not jealous. Stop trying to make problems
What happens to mbappe and his ego?
Mbappe gonna score 90goals per season with Messi'assist
The next galactico club 😎🙌🏻
It is you guys who spread things like Neymar doesn't want to be under Messi's shadow.......(except the guy in the middle)
Who would have thought that the greatest transfer in footballing history would come as a free agent.
Bayern vs PSG part 3 🔥🔥🔥
Once there're MSN,  will there be MBP ? 🤔😉
Instead of MBAPPE, MESSI should be there   and where Messi is Angel di Maria should be there.   Guardiola plans of playing Messi as a CF makes him winning Championship for 2008-12.
Neymar can’t deal with Pressure.   He wants his easy.   🤡
Yall really instagating ! It’s the big threee
The media making up stories. Neymar never said anywhere he left barça because of messi. They're looking to start some drama
Just waiting for the next tsunami from PSG
When ultimate team like fifa comes real😍🔥
😂la liga hve nothing intresting left, and still desperate to promote la liga must watch😂
This is neymar team Messi will be in the be in the shadow like an ad and lebron
Messi/PSG: We gonna win our first UCL this new season KLOPP: Hold my beer 🤙🤙🤙
They feel fking happy.
neymar has grown alot in his days at PSG ,i remember his first year he fought with cavani about taking pens and freekicks ,over the course of 2 years he started to mature and he constantly gives cavani or mbappe chances on the spot if they are close to a hattrick ,i even remember him giving cavani a pen in 2019 i think when cavani was having a scoring drought of 2 months and it was his last 2 weeks at PSG before joining united and ney gave him a pen to reach the milestone of 200 PSG goals. this is NOT the same barca neymar
I just don’t understand how everyone ignoring De Maria.
PSG is a cheat code
More than Neymar, I think Messi's presence in the team will temper Mbappe's ego quite a bit. Over the last year you saw it pretty clearly that he wants to be the main man. Messi's attitude towards the game in general is wonderful and his humility should teach Mbappe a lot about what it means to be a top player and what it really takes to remain at the top for a very long time. If that doesn't change his attitude, then God help whoever would sign him in the future.
Neymar is like man I just can’t catch a break 😂😂😂😂
Messi at his age right now, he's not gonna make anybody in his shadow he play his best to stay at the best. Don't be delusional, football is a team sport not a sport to over shadow your team mate.
Is laliga is for politics???? They think they are greater then players .....
UEFA should be investigating PSG.  But we all know that Kelafi is now chairman of the European Clubs Association.  Ceferin is corrupt to the core.
after few trainings ramos will quit football(soccer)
Neymar only cares about getting his diving technique right.
What happened to bayern munich? Germans gonna face a death line up.
I can bet 1k euro PSG won't win CL even with those 3 :). Names don't play.
First Russ to lakers…now this…man sports this year might be crazy 🥶
He look genuinely happy...
MnM
There was Ronaldino when Messi came into Barcelona, so as Mbape
Messi joining PSG will test Pochettino's managerial pedigree. Pochettino will be rated with the likes Thomas Tuchel, Pep Guardiola, and Zinedine Zidane.
The only thing Neymar cares about is his Acting Career 🎭
Why do i feel the pundits are snakes ..looking for negative aspects . More like womens who keep bitching.
People go to PSG to make money. Zero champions leagues so far. Only domestic titles thats it. Retirement club.
I think this will be the downfall of messi
The most hilarious part about this is that ESPN just signed a $1.4 Billion deal with La Liga 🤣
Neymar never plays in anyone’s shadow, the only way Neymar would be in Messi shadow that is if when Neymar score & display his skills you guys call Messi name & give him the credit.
Neymar regretted leaving Barca and missed playing with World class players. He still hasn't started playing seriously in Ligue 1.The league is way too easy for him
This will be the new flavor of "M'N'M's"
if neymar wanted to play with messi.. then i think he’ll accept playing 2nd fiddle
mbape no se va al madrid  im sorry mbape dont go to play at real madrid because arrive to psg leo messi and this game is called  mesis  age  and now mbape want play with messi and neymar  they are the phenomenal players in this tounament  ....dont forget to demaria and ramos and others players waooo  what  a team powerfull  asi es la cosa yo alegre por ver este tridente tan poderoso y demaria desbordando...ya lo quiero ver cuando aparezca messi en la cancha la felicidad que va a causar a paris y a todo el mundo que lo veremos de nuevo.
Just wait till Chelsea beat them....lol
If PSG will not win UCL Pochettino's coaching license must be revoked after the final whistle SWAP
Jules the only intelligent journalist from ESPN. Kinda sad really
I imagine they'll react pretty well. Broadly, top forwards seem to enjoy working with people on their level. This has been true at all clubs fortunate enough to have a truly killer front line. Neymar may have wanted to be the star, but I think he'd rather be a part of a killer trio likely to make a difference than the star of a team falling short.
Why does Ale always think so 'emotional'?
I don't think the team is going to be all about Messi, and Messi realizes it too. Messi refused Neymar's #10 offer because Messi knows he is getting older, slower, and can't run as much as he used to on the pitch. #10 carries a lot of pressure and star power, and Messi wouldn't take that away from Neymar. Much like how Messi played with Argentina during the COPA America, Messi is going to conserve his energy and save it for when he is in the right position to take on defenders and needing to step up because his teammates have done what they can. Messi knows he is past his prime; at PSG it's about Neymar and Mbappe, and Messi is willing to be the supporting cast to assist them with goals.  ESPN needs to stop with their BS analysis that tries to pit Neymar and Mbappe against Messi, claiming Messi is going to take over the team from those two. Messi knows he is a guest at PSG, and everyone who knows Messi well, know Messi isn't going to overstep his boundaries to steal the show, unless he needs to.
That's what messi was looking for a calm healthy enviroment surounded with friends and good players away from negative media and stress and problems
Greatest team Transfer window
Things change..these reporters are old ,think in a old way ..  man there just going to show the world greatness...
Plot twist: PSG gets knocked out in the round of 16 by  Man City
3 of them and the reason is fare play rule is asleep 😂
Europe be very afraid.. psg has become a bigger monster
Messi, neymar, mbappe, ramos and tiago silver is an insane team
PSG is almost like a custom ultimate squad that you usually make in fifa. Probably because Ramos and Messi in same team is too odd for me to see.
If psg don’t win the cl this szn, they are definitely cursed. I just don’t see any team beating them when they are all fully fit
The goat of hip hop is Eminem do you think this will be another goat mnm messi neymar mbappe
I’m glad he left, Barcelona had plenty of deadwood that they wouldn’t get rid of
MnM!! 😂😂
These guys be talking nonsense.
Donnaumma should start n the league or UCL being left in the bench is not a good idea
Psg are the brooklyn nets of football
I think Neymar doesn't care about shadows anymore. But has he made peace with the point that he'll never win the Ballon Dor and the golden boot? That's the reason why he left Barca right, to be the best and rival Messi and Ronaldo?
So Messi is "that guy!"!  Interesting! 🤔 No wonder the guy in the blue shirt said "You're not that guy. You're not that guy".
messi is not happy! he is putting up a smile, i feel he will break down as a point in time and loose interest! He has won it all!! and Barca was his all in all
Good luck to King Leo but this PSG project is short term.🤷
Neymar will eventually move back to La Liga next season.
The best surprise is Ramos and Messi playing the same team !
The correct reaction will be excitement and gratitude.
What about all the talk of how toxic upper management was at PSG that Pochettino wanted to leave PSG? That didn’t just go away those people are still there
Money talks
Who would want a footballer who doesn’t really want to play at your club !!?? Totally mental !!
MNM!
Just imagine, Messi and Ramos on the same team.
Still won’t win CL
ESPN already regretting buying la liga tv rights 🙆🤦
There ain’t no shadow just passion difference
Super team. Mbappe is the only question. How does he respond? The only team that can stop psg is psg
La liga is over.
Its good for messi and psg
All they have to do is buy Ronaldo now lol
Messi is Neymar's idol  and brother . The way they play togheter is the best thing for football right now
My future opposition in Playstation Fifa every other game.
Imagine believing a media concocted narrative and perpetuating it
hahaha neymar just grew up, come on....
Now PSG needs to sign Ronaldo @_@
Will score a lot of goals and win the league but no shows in Champions League.
PSG is the avengers of football.
The only problem Messi had in last couple of years was the Defence . Now everything seems to be in perfect shape ✨
Please psg buy Suarez  please psg let  go back to msn
Lol neymar left because of the management not because of Messi you guys are always looking for clickbait bunch of idiots
I’m sure Neymar can care less if Messi takes over…..
Messi always power neymar to be the best player
CR7 cud never c himself playing in the French league at the age of 34.CR7 loves a competition and not money
MNM already sounds like Eminem 😁. Oh boy, we're gonna have some GOAT LEVEL HIP HOP football to enjoy. 😎 Can't wait 🇫🇷💙🤍❤️
How is Donnarumma not in the PSG possible starting XI????
Omg 😱 is going be amazing
As as matter of fact, five!! Don't forget Ramos and Navas at the back!!!😁
see why neymar let messi win copa this was messi way of saying thank you by switching clubs remember to be considered he had to win copa
Now!!! It’s not who’s going to play Second fiddle    Remember it was Neymar who want Messi for them to play together not like these clowns 🤡 interpretation who first n who second. M.N.M looking to make history in PSG to win UCL together as 1 and as a Team….
Messi luar biasa
I wish Messi and his family all the best. He deserves every dollar they pay him.
I mean Neymar doesn't think that way this isn't a matter of shadows it's more like a reunion of two friend playing together idk what y'all talking about Neymar offered he's 10 to Messi and Messi refuse
I think if PSG win the UCL, Mbappe might be tempted to stay at PSG for another 1-2 years.  The only thing that beats winning the UCL is to repeat it again the next year.  Playing for Real Madrid is great but doing a repeat win of the UCL is priceless.
Let see what happen now waiting for Leo debut.
I always get feeling stevie switches off when ale starts talking and doesn't like him!
I think the arrogance of neymar and mbappe will prevent them from ever working well together.
Super squad of PSG
Neymar loves messi and look up to him I'dont  knoe about mbbappe and Ramos .
I. Beleive mbhape will score more goals at this. Season
Who is going to were the #10 now
Now we need Cristiano Ronaldo join PSG next time to complete infinity stones 🥰
Breaking News: Neymar Jr is back to Messi’s shadow.
Mbappe is useless without Space and Pace  PSG should Sign a  Striker  A poacher Target man
This talk about the attack sounds like deja bu to me... they did the same talk about French team on euros lol
a scenario of a psg game with this team:   Messi gets the ball and goes on a run, he gets roughly thrown to the ground by a defender, his eyes are blurry and he sees the defender get pushed by his tall teammate in retaliation then he sees that teammate reach out his hand to help him up. He takes the hand and says "Gracias Gerard"   Ramos: "BRUUHHHH" Messi after his vision clears: "Wait what?? BRUUHHH"
Let’s hope Mbappe will stay 🙏
Signing players for the sake of it doesn't always mean you're improving.
MSN->>>>> MNM
How often did we use to talk about neymar? Not that often. Since the messi’s transfer news to psg its been all about the trio. It’s like messi once again resurfaced neymar and he should know that he only shines when messi is around.
If only Barcelona leave Verratti alone, Messi is probably still in the Camp Nou..
This is not real this is fifa, what A line up🔥🔥🔥
Messi gave up the 10 jersey for neymar….people just hate neymar just to hate him.
Good luck Leo 👏👏👏😍😍😍
This is tret to meny defenders and goldkeepers in France league 😳 Messi is here
Barcelona and Laliga lost their importance. I am guessing Kuman will kick out of Barca until New Year. This is my gues. He does not have any clues. I congrat PSG fan. Enjoy the KING now you will feel what we feel last 15 years.
Look at eachother's face and tell themselves "You are not the center of Universe, He is"
and imagine wijnaldum going to psg to play further forward. well, good luck with that lol
Mbapape will not get the ball off Messi & Neymar.
there is no messi's team, football is a team game....
From now I have to follow and watch PSG game. Oh my God this is so strange.
Ronaldinho leading the way for Messi , Messi doing the same for Neymar
The american analyst is an idiot, always thinking pessimistically
Neymar won’t have a problem with being “overshadowed” Mbappe tho might be a different story
Way to go stevie
I feel Messi will step off and make neymar the king by supply
How will I know that?
Can't help but feel bad for Di Maria but there will  be enough games in the season for him to get some starts, not to mention Neymar getting injured for half the season
Messi promised to Neymar if he stays in Barca I will make you get Ballan d'or.  Now King Messi join him and I promisse you he will do his promise.
What an embarrassment it will be if PSG can only win the Champions League,  because Messi signed 😅
Neymar is happy Messi is on the team because now the favela primadonna can take longer injury vacations during the carnival season.  Without Messi, La Liga will lose its ranking to Ligue 1.
the two best club sides in the past 10-15 years were real madrid and barcelona without doubt. PSG has just plucked the two teams most influential players for free in Ramos and messi. unbelievable statement!
Messi better then both together , will outshine them both
Total rubbish from espn they already trying to to give Messi all the hype how can psg be Messi team when Neymar and mbappe has already proven themselves time and time again even taking Paris to their first champions league final Messi is world class Neymar and mbappe are the next best players in the world what they did for Paris no one else could do we should give all players credit instead of setting them against each other
Front 3 is ridiculous, also think quietly the french league will be happy, brings more viewers to their league, everyone on the planet will want to watch this psg team. La liga have fallen from grace. Not sure where they go from here.
Limit transfer fees to a million and player wages to five grand a week. If they don't like it get another job. I'm sure the world will still carry on without immature cry babies.
Neymar will be happy for sure.But that ninja turtle would be selfish and now he will be pissed off that the real king has arrived
The real madrid galacticos never won a championship league
Playing well together with Neymar, yes that we have seen before. I think Verratti is being underestimated as nobody talks about him. I am very excited and can't wait to see  messi & verratti gameplay
PSG are some kind of dangerous indeed 💯💯🇫🇷🇫🇷❤️❤️
Neymar will be very happy Messi join PSG, Messi is like big brother for Neymar. PSG will be the best Club with trio Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Bravo 👏🏼
Both lads will learn and play with one of the greatest of all time, the little magician hope they end up winning European trophy
LaLiga is no longer a must-watch
Psg are gonna look like NHL all stars vs the Soviets it’s not about the best 11 it’s about the right 11 gonna be a epic train wreck
If PSG lose a game this season, they deserve to be lashed
The end of la liga.
Whose gona be taking penalties and freekicks 😂😂😂
money move... garbage league... messi ain't as great as ronaldo.... ronaldo challenged himself.
Alot of people saying Messi took the easy lane with PSG and aside from listing all the reasons why thts false I'll say this. I'm finally glad that Messi is alongside other players who can hold their own!! Now he will grace the beautiful game with his presence longer and not suffer from hunchback syndrome, a discomfort he was battling for 15 YRS!!!
I actually more excited to see Messi & Ramos going head to head in practice
Money won't buy champions league gor PSG. PSG will win champions league after neymar and messi will leave.
They just like playing together man. Whats this number 1,2..bullcrap ?
mbappe should move to liverpool next year if he wants to be the next G.O.A.T
PSG have put themselves under high pressure of winning.
Neymar knows his place when the goal arrives
Back2 Back UCL, anything less is a failure!! What a super team!
Morono
Are you kidding me? Possible PSG starting XI includes navas with Donnarumma on the bench? Lmao. What fools. Donnarumma is ten times better than Navas and was just named player of the tournament in Euro 2020.
PSG will not make Champions league this year...even with a weakened Real Madrid and a useless Barcelona .. also Athletico Madrid to win back to back La Liga s
Neymar just came back from vacation with Messi and Verratti.
Who will take the penalty kick ? Messi or Neymar
Mans not even kicked a ball and Ale already trying to start unnecessary drama. Neymar is just happy to start playing with his mate again go away with the negativity man.
Less pressure on Messi now. Watch psg flourish.
Messi and Ramos together  What a bizarre world we live in
People focusing on neymar being messi's shadow  The question is will mbappe like to be a shadow too?
PSG will win CL
Are we watching the farmer  League or messi?
Neymar he is the one who bring Messi In PSG  I don’t why you guys always talk about Neymar ran away Messi shadow
Messi deserves a Kaka/CR7 full stadium on The Unveiling we will see how "Iconic" he is
Now barca has no fans🥲
To many galacticos in one team not good titles but good for business
Who are these idiots
I hope mbappe is intelligent enough to stay at psg along as messi is there, he will regret not playing with the greatest footballer of all time for along as he can
Shouldn't Champions League just be given to PSG before it starts? Who's going to stop this team? We try to focus only on the front 3 but we forget how they have strengthened their defense with Donarumma, Ramos and Hakimi even the midfield with Wijnaldum. This is like a perfect team you can ever have.
Neymar will take the Penalties, bigger wages, number 10 Shirt haha Pessi can't be a Dictator at PSG
Imagine playing with ur idol
It's time for Mbappe to go to laliga and shine
Messi to Mbappe: you're not that guy pal. You're not that guy
Messi Will play very good bcoz he will have No pressure like Barcelona
This is totally brutal to other clubs. They are all dead 💀😅😅💯
Lets not forget Messi is 34 years old. He is great but this hype is way too much
It will be a party, because they all know who is the best.
If Messi wins his 7th Ballon d'or and Ramos gets asked on who the best player in the world is, who do you think he will mention? Messi or Ronaldo?
Mbappe will learn a lot from Ramos and messi
No cap🧢 the ball will be 70% going to Messi
Agent Neymar ✍️
But  mbappe is still leaving isn’t he
Hala madrid
How on Earth are they able to afford those 3 superstar players all at the same time?
You are going to see a lot more of 8-0 or 10-0 scores in Ligue 1
I just hope they work as well together as MSN. Would love to see Messi win one last CL even if psg isn’t my favorite team. To be fair you don’t say no to Messi on a free transfer
all psg need is to buy pepe now, if possible sami khedira as well
For the first time since 2015 messi will have nothing but class players around him again
Finally, a new breed of attack is born. I officially call this combination the N-2M (Neymar, Mbappé & Messi). What about you???
Those tiers cleared up quickly 🙄
Neymar left and realized how hard it is to be the man of the team.  He needs some pressure taken off of him.  Too many hard tackles
Why does Messi has less ego than Mbappé?
How much money have PSG spent this summer??? And why hasn’t financial fair play done anything?
Genuinely, for all the people saying Neymar doesn't care at all about Messi's shadow: why did he leave Barca in the first place?
Y’all have the dumbest video titles
financial fair play? where are you? if chelsea had assembled a squad like this all these pundits would be crying injustice...
The media always likes to find something negative to talk about... Neymar doesn’t care about being second place or first place, he enjoys playing with Messi and they will meet again, he even offered to give up the number 10 jersey for Messi so that says enough, there’s no need to reach for a negative factor cause he clearly doesn’t mind.
Am I the only one who is not happy of all this situation? Never Liked PSG, never will. With Messi or without Messi. Messi will forever be linked to Barca in the psyche of many. So sorry Messi but will not be rooting for you this time.
Messi and Neymar together are perfect. This talk of overshadowing is utter nonsense. When he was at Barcelona he was in contention for the Ball'andor  when he moved to Paris he wasn't. He's better with Messi than without him.
PSG really just took the captains and legends of both Real Madrid and Barcelona and signed them for free in one window
Messi is that guy Pal
Oh great here go again ano🙄
It doesn’t matter who the guy is. If they have the hunger and they are focused to win the champions league it doesn’t matter who is the “guy” is all it matters is to win.
I think this team does not need a coach , without coach they well win
If memory serves me right neymar was at FCB so he played with Messi mover a 100 times,did they not play in a final just over a month ago.stop with y'alls foolishness
Barca fans are now ordering their PSG shirts
Why would Neymar be the second guy? He would actually be the third Mbappé is an overall  better player
Imagine messi and Ramos celebrating a win together in the bernabeu or in nou camp😳
When Neymar was thinking leaving Barca, Messi asked him "What do you want?" I'll make you next Ballon d'or, don't go". Messi is here to help the team, specially Neymar, not to take over and that's why he refuse to take Neys number 10.
These people are terrible
Commentator is Toxic AF Neymar don't care!!!
Waiting Ronaldo 😂
Pochetino has no excuses now, will need to win every single game or else he's gone unfortunately
RAMOS and MESSI????????? Hooooooooow!
Neymar and are very good friends
Money not football PSG should be banned  , no fair play , scumbags
Weak players should sign with a weak team in a weak league
It’s quite laughable the way these sugar daddy clubs are run.  Why wouldn’t Messi take a pay cut, it says it all really money talks not loyalty.
Are we not going to addresses Stevie’s haircut? 😂
Quit pedestializing mbappe hes overrated
PSG have become LA Galaxy 😂 Non-Competitive
Heck PSG’s B team can beat Barça
MNM😱
Man psg really got real Madrid  and Barca's former captains on the same transfer window. This is something out of the twilight zone
goo messi!
It’s funny Neymar never said all the stuff their saying, oooh I wanna be my own man I want my own project. He’s never said that Neymar is well aware that Messi is Messi so that’s no problem
money talks!
When Messi realizes he won’t be playing Spanish teams 😂
its like they have way too many good players
LOVE MESSI M30
Neymar literally left because he wanted to be number one in his club. The guy literally caused a scene with CAVANI about who should take PKs.  M’BAPPÉ said multiple times to PSG that he wants to have more responsibility.  MESSI is the greatest player ever.   At least two of them will have to pretend that it’s all good. I hope with all of my heart that PSG sinks HARD as MESSI remains the best player in the squad. I simply can’t root for *SO MUCH MONEY* ! Considering that we’re talking about Ligue 1, RAMOS, WIJNALDUM, Neymar, M’BAPPÉ, DI MARÍA, VERRATTI and MESSI, this is literally *overkill* at this point.   I understand that UEFA wants to reward PSG for openly declining the offer to join the Super League, but completely removing FFP because of “COVID and empty stadiums” when you still command La Liga to take measures against clubs who live on debts is flat out dishonest. Giving the World Cup to Qatar was already huge enough.
Commentators are absolutely rubbish, stirring up negative vibes between good friends
PSG presenting us with the new GALACTICOS ERA!
These guys can't give up on the whole "shadow" thing ffs... No punditry, just bs discussions
Only one missing from PSG roster now is Cristiano lol, I never thought it was gonna be possible to financially have a stacked team like PSG, other than career mode.
messi only left to get out of braithwaites shadow just like neymar
MESSI and Sergio Ramos will be BOX OFFICE Can not wait
Neymar while back said in a interview that if he wanted a teammate to play with him he wants messi in psg with him
With Neymar and Mbappe on the team, I can only imagine the number of assists Messi can collect..
We need Suarez
Incredible how messi is 34 and not shown any decline
good players like to be surrounded by good players.. its that simple
Neymar is 2 Inmature so mbappe and neymar have to much to learn
Even Ronaldo don't get the reception that Messi got when he went to Juventus.
Psg shall win champions league in 2022
The question  is  can psg win ucl   or not
Messi will tell Ramos in practice  “ La Concha De Tu Madre”. 😆
messsi ❤️🖐️❤️
Ronaldinho: " I can smell the champions league at PSG already
Financial fair play is a joke lol the front three alone is probably more expensive then Barcelona and Real Madrid 😂
Psg since there lost 6 1 there destroy barca neymar now messi
Hey analysts.....wat about defence? Lol u guys are silly
Don't start this nonsense.  They are close friends. We saw what happened after Messi won the COPA AMERICA.
imagine messi gets injured first game and out for the season, imagine
Lol. Moreno has a gift for reading Neymar’s mind.  P.s sarcasm.
Messi won't need to be vaccinated to get around France.
Neymar mbappe and messi you know lol PSG showing Man City how to really spend that tainted oil money…
Immediately stopped the video when I saw Ale Moreno. Who made this guy a commentator?
All this talk about Neymar playing second fiddle to Messi is just nonsense.
Busquets...
Money talks....
Snob mbape got no respects, he is just mediocer. Sorry.
Neymar doesn’t really look at it like he’s being overshadowed by Messi but the opportunity to play with his best friend again and the goat. It was primarily neymar who convinced Messi to come to PSG and even offered his no 10 shirt to him
Hello Jules... Medicals are a common thing you know.. it’s a part of every pre-season routine!
Ohh Ale Moreno just Shut up... Y tf r u painting Neymar as such an ego 😂... U do realise Neymar was the first to hype up the Messi to PSG Saga lol
Man this team has leaders all round 😳. If PSG don't win the UCL 8n the 2 years Messi is here then this team is cursed 🤦🏽‍♂️. PSG without Messi was already a bit crazy, but now😳.
Why isn't there anyone having problem with this? PSG is stacking stars and clearly violating Financial Fairplay but hey let's get them a pass because it's Messi.
It's the coach comes into play if he psg could coach
I think it's obvious they will play with 3 centre backs, Kimpembe won't be in the bench.
Poor espn plus just contracted laliga then Messi left and go after Bein sports with league 1 with Messi will play. Shocked
Wait I saw Navas as 1st goalkeeper and Donnarumma as second on the bench? 🤔
Mate Neymar is already playing second fiddle to Mbappe, he's now 3rd fiddle
Neymar went to PSG to get out of Messi's shadow, then realized he couldn't manage being the focal point.
Neymar and Messi work because he has no ego. If it was Ronaldo then they would be scrapping on the pitch
If  am Pogba I would stage hunger strike to join PSG!!!
messi going to convince mbappe to sign for barca in the future
Its THEIR team. They have been fighting to play with each other for a couple years now
I have been a Barcelona fan even before Messi, and i think it serves Barcelona right to lose Messi without even receiving a copper for his transfer. I guess best things in life are free. I don't like how they treated Suarez, how they dealt with the transfer window of late signing poor players that don't deserve to be Barca players thereby suffering unwanted humiliating losses last season with Messi playing all alone. I don't like the coach Ronald Koeman and his tactics. Pretty sure all this made Messi leave and am happy for him but sad for my club for losing their greatest player ever and probably forever because of the way football is going.
“Neymar will be in Messi’s shadow again” I think they’re forgetting that neymar wanted to go back to barca just last year. Neymar’s ego won’t be a problem.
Fake news
They should do a 343 formation
He is wrong. Is Messi comes to a team managed by PEP, PEP WILL STILL BE THE MAN
He's happy to be back with Neymar Jr of course. he's going to be happy with friends again at least. 🙏 go leo ❤💙 its gonna be amazing to watch!
Psg might be a scary scary team for the next couple years. Even with mbappe leaving on a free transfer next season, cristiano ronaldo will be a free transfer as well so replace mbappe for ronaldo & you’ll have Messi Neymar ronaldo front 3 for the next couple years & for this year Messi Neymar mbappe
Kylian Mbappé was out shined Neymar before Messi
In this psg team messi will not be better than anyone and the team won't be build around him
Messi in Barcelona was the main man, but not in PSG. He will be part of a great team with great players. I support Arsenal and if could have Messi or Mbappe, I'm choosing Mbappe.
Neymar, Messi, Mbappe, Ramos they better win a champions league
Ramos was program to tackle Messi 😁. I think they deactivate the Madrid chip in his head during his medical
This is the 1st time I have some constructive sence from Stevie and I like the way he reeled in the agitating Moreno,,well done Stevie. I think Neymar's embassadorial work played a BIG part in this deal. Ney the man PSG hated there for a wlile some time ago paid dividence now.
Ramos Messi playing together just complements how the world is strange in these times of rona
But who’s wearing the #10 though 😂
Neymar : Am the King in PSG !  Khelaifi : Nah bro !!! U just support ! Messi : Ney , Sad life eh 😎
Neymar Messi and Suarez played at Barca in their prime. Still have loads left in their tanks but am I to believe this trio is better? They also had Iniesta and Xavier. They will be fun to watch.
If Mbappe leaves, PSG should get Ronaldo. We might get the chance to watch Messi and Ronaldo in the same team next season
Just insane how he left Barcelona, they couldn’t even give him a proper farewell. It’s extremely disgraceful and depressing for him knowing he wanted to stay and now is forced to go play at a lower level league because unfortunately no other club can afford him but PSG (which is even sadder).
I wonder how messi and ramos will work 😂
I'm happy for him
I honestly think that Ney, Messi and Mbappe are a better trio than MSN, I'm excited to see what they'll do this season.
A very good analysis
I actually think mbappe will still try to move this summer. Real Madrid has always been his dream move, regardless of Messi's arrival
Neymar does not care about all this shadow nonsense. He just wants to create something special again with Leo and his teammates at PSG.
messi is a dummy for signing for psg
Ney he's HAPPY that's all.....
If Mbappe leaves, he's arrogant and making the same error Neymar did when leaving PSG. If Mbappe thinks he's winning the Champions League with Real while Messi plays for PSG then he probably also believes his sh*t doesn't stink.
A little bit of a brat 😂. How is he allowed to say that on TV
They probably will not win Ligue 1
Neymar,Messi, and DiMaria!!
This will make club competition interesting and exciting, but it won't effect the positions on the national teams necessarily for the World Cup but in regards to club level competition it will be interesting in the next couple of years for sure.
Mbappe is so lucky to have a role model like Messi. All this time all he's had is Neymar. He's the real winner here.
When in doubt at ESPN call the name Manchester United
Sell mbappe and get ronaldo
All the defense in football going to in floors
I think honestly in terms of club level men's competition PSG is ranking up to be not just the best team in Europe but the best team in the world. Sure in the UEFA champions league there will be competition from Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Juventus, Real Madrid, Liverpool, but considering the superstars and talent that PSG has now they will rank up as a strong favorite to win championships in Europe and world titles in the Fifa Club World Cup. Barcelona with all due respect they build a legendary legacy for Messi in his career and build the best club team in the world, but in the end later in his late years they ended up blowing it losing Neymar, then losing Suarez and eventually the house of cards came down where Messi would leave Barcelona for a better club and team in the moment. The real truth is that Barcelona' poor final decisions and bad management in Messi's last years ended up costing them their positions which eventually would see the rise of other teams passing them in the process not just Bayern Munich, Chelsea etc.
I have a feeling MNM will be better than msn
Neymar doesn’t care. Messi probably doesn’t careless about being the man either. Messi will make them all better and they all will make Messi better
Shut up u clown, its not a family its a team and the best wa t to play with the best.. Envy and jealousy is not applicable
Só eu to curioso nos records q tem no PSG😂
Mbape shadow  has arrived
When messi gona try and dribble the players he gona have to face 12 because ramos would be slide tackling him
M N M
Not a surprise that they rejected Super League and not a surprise that the FFP is ‘loosely’ applied this season! Not a surprise that La Liga didn’t support Barca with FFP relaxation. And definitely not a surprise that Jules is not able to explain how PSG is able to afford all these players when other clubs like Inter are having to sell everyone to survive!
Mbappe won't renew he might leave next year on a free
Neymar doesn't even care
against who will u lose ucl this time
Ramos once said: "Messi and I will make a great team". It was just a matter of rivalry between both of them at La Liga, no love lost.
Yea right,  mbappe will now b rigtfully humbled in messi's presence.
Neymar hasn't been happy at PSG since he left Messi and now i feel we will see a new inspired Ney with Messi, there will be magic out of the two again. Now you add a fast, deadly shooter in Mbappe?? Insane shows to come in Paris
At this moment messi is not better than embpe
A jordan logo in a Football jersey... This sport is dead!
Messi knows he cant score more than 20+ in PL, unless in farmer league
Messi is jackpot  Psg. Wil wIn  champonis lague whit mabpe Neymar   Ramos waljdum    This team  god
CR7 wins 6th UCL after beating PSG IN Semis with an away hatrick. You heard it here first.
Junk crazy never would have thought this, this game is beautiful
U guys don't have subjects to discuss....Neymar and messi are friends just try to understand that  first...they together make a great duo...
Psg will never win CL even with Messi
Is ale’s hair growing back
The so called best league in the world couldn't pull this off but the farmers did!
A team now where number 10 is less valuable . And realmadrid and barca captains are teammates. Talk about an upgrade 🙄
Messi should have went to the prem if he wanted to prove is self
Messi has a new girlfriend and her name is: PSG. Some exciting times are ahead of us, futbol fans
PSG are obligated to win the champions league as a minimum
Unless he goes Juventus.
Shutup baldie
MNM best attacking trio ever
that squad depth man, if psg cant be contendors for the ucl this season some people will def be sacked
Galácticos PSG....
Messi whos worth half a billion, basically cried because barcelona wouldn't pay him 35 million euros a year to stay. Instead, he goes to a pub league because PSG will pay it...
Totally agree with you Stevie you hit the point❤🙏✌✌🦾🦾
Messi a definition of a real snake he was just crying and people say money canot but happiness
So weird seeing the PSG emblem behind Messi
When Neymar left Barcelona it was clearly because he wanted to get out of Messi's shadow which i can empathize with .  But this feeling was only up for the next two seasons after he join PSG and in last few years he has growned and  changed his view  and people also now see him as a separate identity who is also a superstar on his own .
This won't work, too many egos espically mbappe.
And with Messi, Neymar, Mbappe, Ramos, Paris will STILL not be able to win a Champions' League title : )
Ale moreno is a great pundit, said no one ever
We will watch messi play football with no  load... And messi absolutelly play crazier
Messi could've had the Number 10 shirt for himself but he let Neymar have it.  Now that is something else!
when will Leo start playing? I saw the league just started too.
ESPN always trying to find a way to attack Neymar
Navas getting scored even in practices.
Chelsea was playing career mode with the financial boost last summer while PSG is using the free agent glitch this summer.
Neymar left to escape Messi.  When Neymar and Messi played before, they were awesome!
That jersey is already sold out 😂
Pessi will take all the penalties now and give psg more embarrassing nights in the CL, so they might be frustrated that this fraud has joined them.
This is gonna be crazy 😪🔥. It's really nice that neymar offered the no.10 shirt. Touching that Messi is gonna wear the number he wore the first time he made his debut in football🔥. That no.30 on his back is gonna be crazy to get used to though 😂😂
I wonder whose gonna carry Barcelona now
I thought this guy was crying yesterday, the signing is too quick seems like he knew about this a whole month. Crocodile tears!!
They said they are carrying torch light this whole season
You guys do realize if mbappe leaves next season psg will bring ronaldo to psg then its gonna be the legendary trio of messi neymar and ronaldo
Always thought Neymar would return to Barca, not Messi joining up with him at PSG. Incredible!
That was Brutally honest
What happened to the FIFA Financial Fair Play. PSG where already in trouble over this and now they sign Messi, how?
Well his new jersey is “almost sold out” in the psg website.
Tuchel so happy Messi joined PSG
If they bench donaruma I swear
Alejandro trying to create a narrative that don’t exist. Neymar wanted Messi to come to PSG. He knew if Messi comes he will be the guy but surely for him that is clearly not the problem. Neymar is probably the happiest guy right now with Messi coming in.
The other 3 take turns off the bench.
You think they will be able to win everything ? I will get a go laugh when a lil team run circle around them
Unless he went to Juventus😅
These 2 years will be legendery :D
MNB
MSN delivered 1 champions league, BBC delivered 4 champions leagues, how many will MNM deliver? Will the real slim shady please stand up.
My biggest concern is the manger I dont have faith in his ability but it's almost hard to go wrong with a squad like that.
Now its time to sign Ronaldo to PSG
Messi, Ronaldinho and Eto'o for me were a better front three and other teams coped with them... Even Messi, Neymar and Suarez would top this front three for me, yet they didn't win everything back to back...
Good luck Messi 👍bring CL 👏💪to PSG
If only werner took advantage of that 'freshness' last season for chelsea
MMN Messi mbappe Neymar
Wow.
MNM - Their palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
It was always a myth that Neymar left not to be in Messi's shadow. Made up by the media's biased hate towards him.
Neymar ain’t gotta play second fiddle to Messi. Neymar’s in his prime n should play his game. Messi’s older now and doesn’t get around the pitch with the certain quickness anymore. Junior just has to play his game
Neymar and Messi is a lot like Ronaldinho and Messi. The student becomes the master. And we have seen that student (Neymar) trying to become the teacher for Mbappe.
Ali has said it all,that front three is nonsense!
What is he talking about...they do medical at the beginning of every season. Jules is tripping
Neymar realizes that he can’t win UCL without Messi
neymar doesn't care about this shadow talk that the media always likes to talk about for some stupid reason. messi is neymar's idol, his best ever teammate, and a very close friend. Neymar will be very very excited for this season now
Ayeee I’m kinda hungry for some MNM. :D
Francia more money  i am happy for Messi
as a football fan this is the biggest nightmare and probably the last straw that breaks the camels back don‘t think i‘ll see football with the same eyes for some time
Mbappe and Neymar going to have alot goals set up by Messi
They will win 3 or 2 UCL
Les falta hablar español.. :'v
Imagine if Ramos and Messi becomes best friends.
You guys have said it, teams without the demanding superstars have been winning the champions league. On paper it should work but the world of football has changed in the last 5 years. Also Neymar and Mbappe .. lets be honest they aren't the same dynamo players they were a few years back. Barca doesn't shed top line players and I actually think Coutinho will play like he did for LFC without Messi there.
I love how messi creates chances along side mbappe and neymar who also scare a great vision and is selfless and great scores. This has potential to be the deadliest attackers in football history on paper.
Neymar has improved crazy. He learned much from Messi now he is the creator at Paris. Neymar isn’t that teenager anymore. He won’t be in anyone’s shadow especially with a somewhat declining Messi
The only time when Ronaldo or messi isnt the main man when moving to a club. Is when they move to the same club. Imagine if psg isng ronaldo next year. crazy
That is a Galactico Team. OMG. THAT FRONT THREE WITH Ramos, Donaruma at the back.
Ale Moreno is a PSG fan now😂😂😂
ale said it at the end.... imagine an inspired Messi.... he carried some dead reams for years till now and was still inspiring.... imagine a fresh inspired messi with a killer team
The Start of MNM
People are forgetting di maria omg he has contributed so much more than mbappe and possible neymar too
Ale we missed you on Messi departure.
Neymar does not care about being in Messis shadow.. Its why he even wanted to go back to Barcelona a few seasons ago
Why is Ale so excited? Neymar and Messi played with Suarez who at the time way more lethal and efficient than Mbappe.
This just feels wrong in every sense, like we're living in some bizarro world.
Are these the same dumb f*cks who said this was all a power play even after we all saw the writing on the wall that he would leave?
Neymar was already in mbappe shadow from one to another. But he always has good matches his performances always consistent. None footballer believe in order to have a good game you have to score.
Wijnaldum almost became a barca player , now messi is a psg player and will play in the same team as wijnaldum
3 generations in the front 3 😬
This is what it should be     Neymar.        Mbappé.      Messi🤩 Di María.  Wijnaldum.  Verrati.  Hakimi    Kimpembe.   Ramos.     Marquinhos                      Donnarumma
They just run behind and the ball will come to their feet from Lionel Messi
What about Messi and Ramos?? The two boys playing rivalry for the last while ...now they gona play together!! 😎
Now who will dare to stop psg this is really unfair for all  teams in ucl psg now have cheat code  to win the ucl which is really be dangerous to watch and stop saying that Neymar is playing in the shadow again because that does not make    Any sense the guys are friends and they both wanted to play a longside each other and they just dont care about what u guys saying
Definitely Mbappe will be affected, he wants to be the spot of the team. But now with the arrival of Messi, Mbappe might want to move and I hope to Real Madrid.
Is stadiums in PARIS open? Would suck if the fans in FRANCE cant watch Messi play!
Moreno is talking bullsh*t. Messi is 34 already, he's not amazing anymore and he is not getting any younger. And Mbappe is overrated, as the recent Euro tournament demonstrated.
Mbappe is a Ronaldo fan he's probably going to be like meh 😕
You Soo wrong! Neymar left Barca because of the money, not because he wanted wanted to better than anybody. Can you argue about the chemistry the two?
Imagine PSG getting Ronaldo too !!
Theirs no second Fidel is everybody contributing to the club according to their ability
At the End Qatar wins the Race... Just waaaaaaaw the line up for a real Football fan this is amazing 👏 I never though I would have to root for PSG....Viva Messi
All nonsense .....they are the best friend....
Neymar said he'll love to play with messi again, so I don't think he's bothered by it. Don't really know about mbappe.
They have nothing of Chelsea front 6. Lukaku, Havertz, Mount, Werner, Ziyech Pulisic
Why media always have to go negative? They are buddies. Neymar was willing to give his jersey number 10.
Jules cannot stay calm
They always invent narratives and act like they can read minds. Neymar and Messi are friends and play amazing football together. There is nothing troubling that Neymar has to confront, he is a game winner and a playmaker at his best so he'll be happy to have the GOAT on his side.
Can't wait for Ramos to RKO Messi during their training...
How to stop this team  Opp: f**♔ no ideao 🙉
LOOL an it shows English football is hollywood with they overrated players as meanwhile Jack Grealish cost $100 million hahaha
Come on guys ,Neymar didn’t leave Barcelona to be main man or to win ballon dor or anything serious for football  You know he left for 500k a week  Don’t make people stupid !!
Neymar. Mbappe. Messi Verratty. Winjaldum. D maria Bernat. Marquinhos. Ramos. Hakimi             Donnarumma
I absolutely hate psg. Will never support or forgive them for using oil money to ruin this sport. But part of me is happy that Messi no longer has to carry a whole team for the first time since 2016
Alright PSG, let Mbappe go to Real Madrid and give Icardi to Juventus so we can have RONALDO MESSI AND NEYMAR playing together!
Just need midfielders now
Messi will a a real defender on his team his name sergio Ramos!!✌🙏🌎💖🤗💯historical moment!!
I think di maria deserves to start
I feel like Messi is just in a visit but actually plays for Barca
Lol neymar would feel the extra shadow he would be under now
Moreno talks like he’s got a few ballon D’ors
donnaruma gk rb hakimi rcb ramos lcb kimpembe lb theo cdm marquinhos cdm wijnaldum or paredes cm verrati lw neymar st mbappe rw messi 💪💪
If they don’t win the ucl delete the club and part ways
Messi is THE guy
Messi is 34 neymar is 30 ....they talking like this is gonna be a repeat of msn....mbappe not even a striker lol..they gonna fall flat to a younger hungrier team in the champions league
Messi and neymar  are real good friends why this guy is making like they enemies to each other
Neymar left because of the money, he ain't second best to no one.
They're still not the best though. They don't have ngolo kante....
Why they put a photoshop photo Is so garbage how they win views
theres a video psg posted of messi and his wife in a plane pointing at the eiffel tower. you can say thats for promotions and stuff but i think they are genuinely excited about coming to a new environment once they get over not being able to live in their old home anymore. unfortunately the kids didnt seem to be too excited when messi was on the balcony waving to the fans
Now media will start with their MMN rubbish
Winning the copa also the way he did it legacy complete now he is just going to without all the pressure with pressure 750 goals 350 assists just Imagine  without 🤪🤪🤪
3:51 thankyou for showing Navas he is heavily underrated
I dont care if psg win anything or get hated but Messi being happy with neymar and even ramos? plus playing with mbappe is a bit wholesome icl reminds me nearly of the old barca
Here we go again with this “shadow” thing!!!  People like you helps provoke Neymar to left Barca in the first place. Just enjoy them playing and stop promoting the idea of Messi “shadow”
We might even see Messi be even better now since he has better teammates that actually try and not ones that walk around and collect their weekly check running out their contract like pique Sergio umtiti etc
You dont need a coach fort this team lol
My new FIFA team is PSG!
Now the coach has to remind Ramos before every game not to tackle Messi.
Kimpembe Marquinhos Ramos Hakimi.  Veratti. Wijnaldum. Bernat                       MESSI (false 9) Mbappe.                                Neymar.
THE TEAM MESSI DOESN'T HAVE TO TO CARRY ON HIS BACK... ITS A BIG RELIEF!!! ALHAMDULILLAH... ALL THE WAY LIONEL MESSI!!!!!
Actually Messi is priceless, because he has no record of transfer fees.
The only way to stop those three is to give them injuries 🤷🏾‍♂️
psg ultimate team xd
Welcome LIONEL MESSI the Greatest EVER!!!!
All this team need is tuchel that's all PSG needs
Lord have Mercy on. The. Defenders next season.
Yeah yeah all nice and all but these psg wouldn’t even be able too beat Chelsea let alone a full Liverpool squad let alone Bayern Munich if city 🏙 get Kane let alone Manchester city psg winning the champions league jajajajjajajjajjajjajajajajajjajajajajajajajajajjajajajajajajajajajajajajajjajajajajajajakakakkakakakakaka who is scoring the goals in the big game in the quarter finals semi finals Messi jajajajajajjajaajjajajajajaajajaajja Messi jajajajajajajjaaj what a joke of a team
The GREATEST TRIO IN THE UNIVERSE MNM!!!!!!
Who wouldn't want to play next to the goat!!
This team from front to back are all well established football icons...just wow
Awesome Neymar and Messi back together
Messi will be the Ronaldinho for mbappe
This guy is crazy if he thinks Neymar left Barca to be his “own man” … the 200 million had nothing to do with it 🙄
What a move for the Parisian club! The best player of all time Lionel Messi in PSG wow😲
I would take Paredes out and put Di Maria in. He’s sooo underrated and doesn’t get enough credit
Plot twist: PSG fail spectacularly with this team. They don’t win Ligue 1 and crash out of the group stage in Champions League 😂😂
Just bring this PSG to EPL and they will be sixth best after the likes of Leicester
Everyone happy untill icardi ask antonella for her number....
Neymar is over rated. Have you seen his goals in numbers as the seasons has gone by during his time at PSG? It's gone lower and lower. Everyone there thinking MNM will be a scary trio. It won't be better than MSN. No chance. That's mainly because Mbappé isn't as good as Suarez was during his Barcelona time. Also, Neymar has gone worse instead of better with age. Messi may still have it but he's not getting any younger.  Everyone expecting PSG to win it all. I don't think they will. They could buy they shouldn't be expected to win it all. It only takes one bad game to lose the champions league.   Look at Ronaldo when he joined Juventus. A team that went to two champions league finals in three years. Everyone thought Juventus would be favourites to win it with Ronaldo in the squad. Messi said Juventus are already a great side and Ronaldo makes them even better and I'm putting them as favourites. Juventus haven't even gotten to the semi finals never mind winning it   Pochettino should not be blamed for not guiding PSG to champions league glory and neither should the team. One bad game is all it takes to lose it. Even the best lose  If PSG kept Tuchel then they would have been strong favourites to win it but they sacked him and I'm not sure what the reason was behind that but if PSG win the champions league then great but I'm not expecting them to win it. I'm expecting them to get to the semi finals but not win it. If they win it then great. Good for them
Someone will miss a job interview to go watch all three players play.
MNM is going to be one heck of trio to watch
who is bothered he has gone for the money  why would anybody go to that joke of a league in your 30s 40s yes i would rather watch the 4th tier english league
This project is guaranteed to fail. PSG is a team of Egos and if the Galacticos are any indication is that a locker room of egos is incredibly hard to manage. Ramos, Messi, Neymar, Mbappe. All these are HUGE personalities with large egos. Pochettino will be eaten alive and I guarantee it the club owners will have zero patience. Mark my words, this project is destined to implode from inside.
Mbappe will react goning to Madrid
Does it bug anyone else that they never mention the fact that Ramos and Messi will be playing together?
The Real question is how will Ramos? I can imagine he has quite a bit of PTSD from what Messi has done to him over the years. What if he has a flashback and accidentally takes out Messi not realizing they’re on the same team now. Can you get a red card from tackling your own player? If you can, Ramos will find a way🤣
I think Messi will help neymar and mbappe become better then they already are
First time psg is stronger than madrid and barca in Europe
I dont think Neymar cares about being in anyones "shadow" hes just happy he gets to play with one of his mentors again, you guys are making something out of nothing
Messi also couldn't win when Neymar and Iniesta left. How about them apples?
When u play with God of football u adjust
42? That’s all? Lol
In the end it was all about the money and those tears of Messi meant nothing…
Messi vs Ramos. Old enemies become new friends. 🤣🤣🤣 I want to see that.
I know this is the Messi show but why is Donnarumma on the bench?
Stevie again talking nonsense saying Mbappe’s gone off the rails the last 12 months. Unbelievable
The dynamite finally took shape!   Just a spark .. and PSG will do damage 💥
We have all seen MSN for 4 years, they were literally unstoppable, this trident will be amazing to watch no doubt. Yeah it's exciting for PSG fans, n they deserve it, but Journalists have followed BBC v MSN for so long, I can't understand their exaggeration OMG...
Neymar and Messi has too much respect for each other
Finally, a team that Messi doesn't have to carry on his back for the whole season.  Edit: To all the haters who are replying to this, suck these cojones.
This deal should have never happen. Messi should be in Barcelona.
I am done. I will never return to reality.
Will Sergio Ramos apologize to Messi after all these years of fighting
If Mbappe keeps his focus and stays humble, this will work out great for him. Because when Messi drops deep (He will), Mbappe’s speed in behind will be just terrifying. And defenses can’t back off, because of Messi’s threat shooting from outside the box.
The greatest trident was MSN  Now it will be MNM 😳😎
All these clowns who talk about this “in his shadow” nonsense need to realise this isn’t about lust for power. It’s about creating an environment like MSN had at Barca where Messi, Neymar and Mbappe can combine and bring champagne football to the club. The owners have fulfilled their dreams with the UCL now left to get
PSG=Space Jam Monstars😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This overrated and unbalanced PSG team will get exposed in Europe.
Please football just bring in a Salary cap and stop the clock when the ball is out of play. There are reasons why nearly every other sport has these rules...
Despite their hatred for each other I think RAMOS and MESSI will be glad they're no longer facing each other in duels.
NO NO NO I LOVE MESSI ❤ BUT THIS IS HAVE TO BE NEYMANR TURN FOR MESSI SHOULD HELP HIM ALSO LIKE HE HELP HIM IN BARCELONA FOR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 2012..
‘You could not live with your own Failure…and where did that bring you..back to MEssi..’
Neymar offered Messi the No 10 but he refused. And to be honest, I'm glad. At Barca Neymar was under Messi cause it was his team. PSG is Neymar's team and the project is circled around him and started with his transfer, then came the others. I'm sure Messi understands that. The only one who will feel like a third wheel will be Mbappe.
Football is ruined
psg is gonna break fifa 22 lol
Hey Jules, I can tell you exactly what's going through Messi's mind right now...  £££$$$$$$$$$$💰💰💰
Can't wait to see Messi 1st gamr
As far as Neymar is concerned, this is good.
PSG activated the Cheat Code for their first UCL trophy 🏆
Neymar keeps the number 10 because he’s the better player, Messi is obviously still good which is why he has a 0 still on his shirt.
Messi, Neymar And Mbappe Playing Together, I Have No Idea What's Coming
Da fuk you mean??? Paris just signed MnM
ESPN trying to find problems where there is none.
Mbappe plz stay man for atleast till Jan then decide whatever you want Don't move anywhere now. you won't regret
Don't build the team around 1 player. Build a team that works together.
I personally don’t feel that makes neymar player number 2 I think they both realize together they are their best, they’ve matured (they means mostly Neymar)
Messi loves oil money
"Wherever Messi goes, I will ride him." -Moreno
Too many bosses in the same office.  Hope they win fvck all.
MEssi will be in supporting role in  PSG , PSG has enough fire power in forward compare to FCB ...
how beautiful is this. PSG takes barcelona and real Madrid players piece by piece and made them into something even more beautiful.
Messi should pull off a Tom Brady championship season! 🏆
Naaam
He is humble enough for it to work…
And they still won’t win the champions league
MNM🔥
Midfield should be full workhorse dont need any creativity in there just do the running for the front 3
It's gonna be a dangerous trio. Watch out everybody.
Mpabbe and Neymar are going be feasting  with goals.
imagine Ramos tackling messi Messi: Come on mannnn Ramos:  sorry old habits 😂😂😂😂
Neymar went to PSG to get out of his shadow now he’s happy to move back there! But Mbappe is more like CR7 so I expect him to leave to become the star elsewhere!
MNM🔥🔥
Messi to put on a masterclass against Barca in the UCL
Mbappe's 🐐 opinion will change after the first training session
I feel sad for di Maria ,his too good for the bench
🔥🔥🔥🔥
