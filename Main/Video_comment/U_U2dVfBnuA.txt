Taylor lost both thrse fights and and serrano 1 and 2.
Both were phenomenal
head...is that a kinda strategy? then i have no interest in boxing...i just better go watch mma
The Only Real boxing Is Women's Now
I like katie Taylor but she hit every opponent with her head 😭😂😂
KT pulled this one out
Cameron winer
For the sore loser Serrano fans, Katie Taylor just beat her a 3rd time...with no headbutts ;]
The head butting is a joke. I've only seen the last 4 fights of Katie and its been every fight. How has Taylor managed to get away with it for so long🤷
Stup^dity, why same color of gloves , sandos and shorts
Kati was hurt a couple times in this fight .
This is a robbery !!!!! How Katie when this fight she lost almost all the rounds
Clash of the Headbutts 😂
This is why shields is the goat , the only female boxer that sets up and sits on her punches 😂
Katie Taylor lost both Serrano fights and both Cameron fights. She should be 21-4
So Katie after getting hit bangers and If she feels like she gonna loose she resorts to headButts noted
What a battle. Both women giving it everything and swinging at each other after the bell on a few occasions. Taylor wanted to turn it into a street fight, lots of holding, grappling and butting of heads. I think Cameron is the better technical boxer and was unlucky not to be awarded a knockdown on the first round. Next fight has to be at Wembley. Come on Chantelle 🥊🥊
Katey is a cheater-every time Chantelle starts landing clean shots she gets held, and the ref allows it!?!  This was one of the worst decisions ever-even if the ref doesn’t earn his keep-the judges could see what was happening in the ring.  You should not reward a fighter that clinches in every exchange thru-out the entire fight.
Serrano beat her. They need to wind it back.
It's truly wonderful to see women's boxing, especially a main fight with a sell out crowd. Both amazing boxers with courage and skill. Well done to them both 👏 inspirational
Cameron is a bigger puncher but I would bet on Katie taking her down in arm wrestle . It would surprise people to realise that Katie could be the physically stronger woman.
Love both these fighters better than the men much love true warriors ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great fight
People talk about Katie's seeming lack of power vs. others she's fought. But she more than makes up for that with her super fast hand speed and combos..
YESY
And a shot after the bell by cameroon great sportsmanship
When you fight Katie Taylor, you're fighting head butts, elbows grappling pushing, pulling, the announcers, and the referee
Cameron is the overall superior boxer by a decent margin imo, but Taylor is a great counter-puncher and her combinations are beautiful.
They’re both great fighters and i dont know any rules about boxing but it is strange that most of Katie’s opponents end up with deep cuts on the head and face ?
Esa mentada Katie es muy tramposa. Se la pasa abrazando y dando cabezazos en todas sus peleas y es muy raro que la amonesten. Todo mundo se da cuenta menos los árbitros y los jueces. Está raro no?
Me gusta como boxea katye taylor❤❤❤ la mejor ..
Who came here after the fight from Netflix? 💀
Katie the headbutt taylor and the hugger 😂😂😂😂😂
100 to both ladies they we're the best of the night 💯
Came back to clarify her fighting style she a head budder for sure
Cameron is literally having to push her off the whole fight crazy to see that now
Cameron is one of the ladies who made me respect women’s boxing. She’s a warrior
Would you look at that  another fight that Katie lost they be counting when Katie punches the air 😂boxing is nothing but a joke and a circus 🎪
its crazy nobody doesn’t see When she start to get tired she started leading with her head.
Katie Taylor reminds me of Greg Haugen,,, Greg's nickname was MUT!  He had a lot of DOG in him...So too, does Katie. Like him, she relies on fighting IQ. With dogged determination ... Look up Greg Haugen see what I mean.
Taylor holds all the time not really fighting .
What is it with taylor and hugging and headbutting.
Cameron was robbed, this was a draw at the best for Taylor at homeground
4:03 headbutt
2:04 If that was a knock down (according to that one Co-commentator) that would be the lamest and weakest knock down i've ever heard of in Women Boxing..
Fukin Women Canelo of Boxing Katie Freakin Taylor...
Katie sure do know how to use her head
Insane. Go to 3:30 and slow it down to .25, it was a near miss.. but tell me she wasn’t looking for that contact..
Just here counting the headbutts
Watching after seeing serrano fight🤦🏾‍♀️ idc to watch anymore of her fights when she cheats anyways I WANNA SEE HER GO TOE TO TOE WITH CLARISSA SHIELDS THO😤
She loves to head but then locks in afterwards
Headbutts oh my daze
Tryna see if Katie really out here head butting
Amanda defeat Taylor Twice and get Robbed. This is mubb.
And it’s true she gets a cut at 4:37 on the video. Katie Taylor is a cheat
Serrano fight was fixed
Katie holds to much and head butts way to much she should have veen deducted. Booo this was a robbery
Después de ver la pelea con Amanda serrano vine a checar las peleas anteriores de Taylor, que sucio pelea
Who is here after watching the fight on Netflix?
she do be head butting lol they was right 🤷🏽‍♂️
Who here from Serrano fight
Katie is leading with her head........
Exeptionalx
Katie was holding a lot. And got knocked down.
Robbery
She got knocked down and she lost on points. What a joke
KT Number 1
Katie won,  much better boxer. In saying that serious respect to Cameron coming to the lions Den,  great fighters
For me Cameron win not Taylor because Taylor always run and hug. Cameron is aggressive .I'm not believe Taylor always hug.
Boxing still fake as you can get fish & chips, how can there be one judge seeing it a draw and two have big margins in the win?
Chantelle was the better fighter specially in the late rounds. In the end Katie was holding and holding ...
Jab jab jab jab
Cameron box box Box box box Box box on abs
Puch
Box
Box cameron box
Hey a hours kate
Not a knock down?😮 Whattt
😮the hugging is ridiculous and the always let her get away with it. Thw fight was close. I wish i could see it all to see who really won.
Crazy Fighters 💯
Strong performance from Taylor it is well deserved, but I don't agree with one of the judges scores of 98-92.
Katie held too much. I thought she lost.
2025🎉 TAYLOR VS MONEO ??? (THE LITTLE PANTHER MAIRA MONEO, from Uruguay ) interim champion WBC ETC ETC.. Come on Taylor!!
Just keep punching
Just punch on jab
katie taylor is magic
Taylor lost the first bout WAY worse than the judges scores. I am not totally convinced she won this one either.
These women are warriors!!! Love Katie!
Biased highlight reel didn't include the intentional headbutting from Katie taylor
Wow taylor lucky theyfidnt count the knock down she wouldvs lost
Hope Amanda watching and wo t let her hug her all night
Tyler siempre ha sido una m***** se aguanta demasiado pura m***** y la hacen una buena boxeadora
Was does it have so few views?
Katy needs to start upper cuts
Robo
Uhmmm draw
Cameron won this fight..
Two great Amazon warriors and I honor both of youl 🌝🌛🌈🇺🇸
For me, even fight. No winner 🥊
Erh, what was that about?
Now with the scheduled rematch in July 20 with Amanda Serrano, Katie will know that the first fight was a robbery. Amanda have to KO Taylor in order to not get robbed again. GO AMANDA 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
The judging was bizarre
GWOAT
GO KATIE GO
Boxeo en Europa son tranposos y escojen a los perdedores como ganadores,Amanda Serrano le dio pela a k Taylor y se vendieron los jueces.
Katie Taylor was bailed out by the knocked down not being called and most of her punches weren’t landing and the crowd cheered
That was a knock down without question.
Cameron won the 1st fight, the 2nd fight  you could argue was a draw, but if I had to give it to anyone, the 2nd fight  would  have to go to Cameron.
Cannot believe!!! a world contest where two athletes wear the same colors....
Fake
Taylor lost that fight rigged
You go KatieTaylor🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Dna love it amen ❤❤❤
Amennnn❤❤❤
Katie, what a fighter!!!She's the best.
Rate them both but Taylor was holding way too much. Feel sorry for Cameron
brutal :p
Women's boxing is where the best fight the best. No ducking. Taylor could have hung around for the second Serrano fight but instead took on two wars with Cameron.
Jamás la Taylor peleará con amanda, la Taylor está muy favorecida, no le quito es muy buena, pero está  favorecida
headbutting competition
👍👌👏👏👏👏💯💌💌😃👀❗   G~G.
This could of went either way
Home town decision
Katie is the boss
Agree to the decission but katie needs to improve her stamina.
I think they both are great! A draw in my humble opinion.
I don't understand how 2 judges had Katie winning and one of them had her winning by a hug margin and then have a third judge have them even? Boxing is corrupt at every level.
In a real fight between women they go for the hair !
Chantelle dominated the first fight, this fight was way closer. A trilogy must be done
from the highlights to me katie lost anyway what do i know i didn't actually watch the full fight.
Great win katie
Taylor is a wrapper in this one. They robbed you Cameron! 🏆
Easy win
THE PRIDE OF IRELAND
Up the fighting irish 💯❤️🇮🇪
Katie beats most men fighters tday hahha 💯 the realist will agree ❤
I don’t get how you can get away with that many hits to the back of the head
Shakur should learn from this ladies  how to fight and have some cojones
Katie Taylor Vs  Floyd Mayweather next
Annoucers are super biased.
Baum vs Taylor would be a nice matchup.
I can't that big mouthed commentator they should get some who is honest  his big annoying  mouth  is way over the top no sport needs bias commentators
Better off watching the full fight and with the volume off if you want to see the result
Cameron got robbed!
Why was Katie hugging Cameron to death 🤔
100% knckdown
Wow what a fight!! Katie was as sharp as a samurai sword ⚔
This a better fight than Shakur Stevenson last fight 😂
Call me old fashioned but ..I find ladies beating the Schitff out of each other a bit unnerving. Probably , maybe my mother's fault , I was brought up with the notion that women were the civilising influence on society.
Great fight.  Two class acts.
Cameron hitting back of the head and after the bell. Then she whines and storms out of the ring at the end.
As an Irishman having not seen the full fight first round was a knock down Katie maybe of Balance but still her opponents hand hit her she went down
best weapon was her head, most biased commentary i have ever heard
What a battle, no backward steps  on this  rematch. Well done  Katie great right hand  Rocket  punches 🙂👍
Im worried for Katie in her later life with all the unnecessary punishment she takes to her head
Two times id seen cameron should have had a point deduction for hitting katie on the back of the head.
Clear Knockdown 😮
Women just don’t have the form that men do. They don’t throw with crispness like men do. They barely hit each other in this fight. If Rod Salka decided he wanted to be a woman and compete, he’d win every fight and get all the belts.
Great fight, very close.
Brilliant night and outstanding atmosphere...toilets were painted white too as every powder dealer and runner in the country were out in force
95-95 Draw
I had it 95-95 draw. And I had first round 10-8 for Cameron, was clearly a knockdown
Camerons head is in front of her hands pretty much most of the time - any fighter deploying uppercuts is gonna send her to sleep
The Pride of Ireland ❤
Watched this one several times now. Gee I wonder who the first judge wanted to win.. was a very close fight both fought tremendous. Huge bias for for Katie  Taylor though was a shame to see. Love Katie Taylor though what a woman
That was a knockdown. Rigged robbery
No one likes a cheat
Taylor needs a lot of hugs apparently.  Disgraceful
The first fight Chantelle Cameron throws a  lot of fast punches this fight she looks slow  that the side effects of steroids
Katie❤
Man this fight was bias AF. From the commentary to the ref. That was a knockdown not a slip. Katie kept coming in with her head  also. Ref was protecting Taylor. They want her to win so bad.
Holding, head going in, clear knock down. Feel for Chantelle, robbed. Bent ref bent judges
Kate lose man Cameron won 100%
So what is next for Taylor?
Great boxer.
One question. If Taylor had stayed with SKY? Still the best though.
6:17 what was this commentator watching?
What a fighter ❤☘️
Ronda rousey would box circles around these women
Wanted Katie to win and glad she won but she was doing way too much grabbing after letting her hands go from what I saw. Great fight tho
She got knockdown with a jab and they rescue her. The level of corruption in this sport is ridiculous. I feel terrible for Chantelle. Her team sold her belt. No rematch clause and the loser of the first fight got a rematch in her hometown. The commentators were the worst. They should never be allowed to speak on anything boxing.
95 /95  who was that cheat  of a judge?
These woman gave us a better fight then ksi and fury
THAT WAS CLEAR A KNOCKDOWN.
I'm a fan of Taylor bless her
The favt thay they didnt even show the knowckdown reply made me not wanna watch the rest of the video 😒
That was a knock down 😂😂😂
FIXED. SCRIPTED BOTH FIGHTS.
This fight was a credit to both those ladies. Katie Taylor is a class act. Trained hard and fought brilliantly she deserves this victory. We shall not see another Irish fighter like her. Chantelle Cameron is a true warrior who kept going until the final bell. A third contest would be fitting for both these combatants. This is the best fight I’ve seen in years.
What a battle took me back to when the men at the top gave the  same sort of performances, True wariors total respect. Best fight I have seen for many a year
No knockdown, play it half speed and you can see Taylor just was off balence and the punch thrown landed on the chest of Taylor.
Wow, Katie got knocked down in the 1st round and they didn’t call it. Katie, holding the whole fight and didn’t get any warnings or points taken away. Unbelievably POOR AND DISGUSTING performance by referee and judges… SMH
Trilogy
Im a fan but she didn't win. It's a circus not a sport.
Well done to Katie but really 98-92 that’s nonsense
Taylor se agarra mucho, no pelea limpio.
Katie won,all the people saying she lost are just bitter. To take the championship from a reigning champ you must clearly win.
Phenomenal. The true Katie Taylor. Serrano wouldn't survive against this version.
that was such an entertaining fight
A Definite knockdown. Wow, how did he not give that? I always find the womens fights a bit sloppy, but you cannot argue with the effort of these 2. I think that deserves another fight. The knockdown would have put that result right on a knife edge....
C'mon guys Taylor was knocked down and the ref bottled it, she was hit, went backwards and down 10-8 round.
Those judges scorecards where all over the place haha.. but katie won for sure.. no doubt
The UK commentary always being bias
English girl was robbed
Taylor lost that by a miles.... no way she won!
The greatest Irish sports person of, All time.....!  Probably the best boxer of all time......🎉❤ And there's a long list...
Fighting Katie in Ireland is a lopsided affair, you're fighting her the ref the crowd and the judges. Clear knockdown nothing made of it and the commentator bias AF too. Ridiculous
How was that not a knock down ... square on got popped and dropped .
My hitta katie she’s back 💜
Very clear that the location gave her the decision. she never won that and must know it.
BETTER THAN THE MENS BY FAR..
Taylor lost but given the fight by political judges
Remarkable fight from both.  If I am Katie's mother however, I am insisting she only fights girls of her own size from here on in.
Personally that was a knockout and she kept grabbing. Chantelle will definitely bounce back
Great match. I would question if a three-minute round would be better for this level of fighter? the two-minute rounds are non-stop action but the extra minute would create a bit more distinction between the close rounds
best women’s boxing match of all time! katie taylor is the GOAT
I really like Taylor but she loss this fight
How was that not ruled a knockdown 🤯
NOW THEY SHOULD HAVE A THIRD FIGHT.
Cameron got robbed. The ref let Katie do excessive illegal holding all fight and also didn't call that clear knockdown.
Katie was much better at the art of boxing.
Bit of a fashion faux pas both of them turning up in basically the same outfit … 😮.. chase me 😅 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Cameron looking at her corner and ref everytime Katie hanged on to her.  Cameron is pathetic and not a champ.  A champ can adapt, change and fight.  It was frustrating to watch, as she could have at least tried.  She threw her chance away.  Silly woman
Cameron all your chat about how your the best and Katie is finished well your eating your words 😂😂 I seen people coming out of car crashes and wouldn't look like you after that fight Katie absolutely schooled you   😂😂😂😂😂
Fight more exiting then watching canela fight
absolute war no defence , I just want to know what's going to happen when all these girls start slurring their speech etc
Taylor does not have any more fight in her.  She can’t even dream of 12 3 minute rounds.  She always ends in a chaotic way throwing Hail Marie’s to try to score…. And only wins if it’s in her Homelands because … she really can’t win anywhere else.  Pitiful to hear broadcasting being so one sided and blind it’s remarkable.
clear knock down smh katie still wins in my opinion but need to stop all da corruption in boxing
Gotta go up again in weight class now
Draw from the highlights considering the knockdown at the start.
Both women were awesome! Great match!
How was that not a knockdown?
Really are we saying that wasn't a knock down ?
What a great fight. Taylor defines her legacy by reversing the defeat, Cameron still growing as a fighter, and loses nothing in dropping a close one to one of the greatest of all time. Sets up the trilogy,
What a great fight both fighters left it all in the ring
I’d like to see Katie retire now
Sorry but why the F wasn’t that a knockdown ?   Imagine this was 3mi. Rounds Katie would be finished
Unless Cameron knocked katie clean out she was never gonna win that fight.
Katie Taylor was holding a lot.
Thought a draw was fair imo😮
Taylor got schooled, this is clear robbery!
As much as I like Taylor, she lost this fight. She was floored with a clear punch that was deemed a slip, and for most of the fight wanted to charge in and hold on. She should have had points deducted for constant use of the head as well. The damage done to Cameron was from Taylor head not hands, and this happened all through the fight. The fight should not have been in Dublin as Taylor was the challenger not the champion. Shambles
Absolute killings from both from the 1st bell - like two freakin cats going at it hahaha. Amazing fight more of this please wow talk about standards lol. What is it about Katie that brings that roaring of the crowd. They will be fighting over who gets to share the ring with her in Croke Park next.
The judge who had it EVEN was paid.
Two great boxer's so glad katie won top notch 👌🥊
In fairness, who’s idea was to have both the fighters wearing exactly the same clothes and hair style.  It’s like watching Link Vs Shadow Link.
Warriors the both of them! Of course, each needs to stop leading with her head.
Cameron got robbed clearly  The ref even took a knockdown away  The cards were rigged  Great fight
Katie gassed all the way through the fight, hugging holding. Plus she got Knocked down
commentating on this match was atrocious, so biased towards katie, everytime she threw those flurries that miss btw you were glowing about her, i was actually disgusted watching it, one judge had it by 5 or 6 rounds???just beacause the crowsd scream doesntr mean she connected. and I like Katie Taylor and i still think it was bad
Katie just hugged 24/7
Wow two warriors!!! However... The scorecards?? One judge had it even, no problem. Another judge had it 98-92? HOW? Katie very lucky to win that. Cameron landed most of the best shots and never took a backward step. The home crowd won that fight. Against boxing is a mess. We should be able to see the score at the end of each round!!!
If I’m being honest I saw Cameron win this fight. Based on rounds won.
1st round that was a knockdown
Were these two purposely made to look like identical twins fighting over the last serve of pudding😅
Katie is a beast… Unstoppable Irish legend.. What a legacy and her career will be unmatched!
it should be a draw and points should have been taken off Katie for holding consistently.  Poor refereeing but respect to both fighters.  96-94 or 98-92 ,I DISAGREE 100%.The judge must be watching something else. There should be a trilogy Cameron fights like a Mexican goddess.I like her style of fighting . She brings war to you right in
As someone born in the UK from an Irish family, it warms the cockles of my heart to see the English and Irish on here arguing over something as insignificant as a boxing match that's done and dusted! 😄.... If only they could have talked about real issues in life just as easily instead of silence.
Poor officiating, Taylor did not WIN this. Cameron remains a better boxer. Taylor gased out and Boxing embraces a bit of make-believe.
If these highlights are representative of the whole fight, then there is no way I can see a Taylor victory here. She got a draw at best. Once again she was on the back foot all night. And I can only suppose the crowd swayed the judges.  It won't be the first time a mob influenced an outcome in sport and it probably won't be the last.
Terrific heart from both fighters.  👏  There were some even exchanges but the better shots came from the smaller lady, Taylor. She was a clear winner. The judge who scored  this a draw, needs to be checked out.
All of the holding, punches behind the head, clear knockdown ruled a slip,  this fight was a draw at worst, Cameron was robbed. Taylor is bang average. Lost twice to Persoon and now twice to Cameron, but only 1 loss on her record, joke!
Both with lion hearts👍👍👏👏
Taylor lost.
Katie Taylor being the irish combats success story really makes it up for us having the likes of conor mcggregor and ian garry. THE GREATEST IRISH ATHLETE OF ALL TIME
Katie has more favours from judges , refs commentators than any fighter I’ve ever seen.
🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮♥️
Katie is just a great person and  custodian to the sport.
Great fight, great fighters. I also loves these commentators but they are so biased towards Katie.
To be beaten like she was last time by Chantelle and then put on this sort of preformance… dofferent gravy
It looked like a legitimate knockdown to me
The juges scoring was wild? I had it a draw but coukd of gone either way.
It's like watching twins different colours needed night mare if you in stadium
Congratulations Katie epic display ❤
Commentator saying great work from Katie when she’s getting battered should have been a knockdown aswel
2 Great boxer's whitin themselves & put a better fight than men 🤗 👊
She still has to run it back with Amanda.
Champions are created . Shes the best ever
Taylor lost that
2 great fighters, think the result was fair. However what struck me was how gracious Cameron was in defeat. She'll be around for a while I think👍
Katie did not win that fight , and they didn’t count Cam knock down , commentary was also bias
1st round knock down Big mystake
Look.....understand that when I say this im a former boxer myself,  I love the sport,  always have....but...I really don't know why women want to do it. It's...in my opinion at least....the polar opposite of what a woman is supposed to be, what  female's are naturally  built for.
Look carefully all of you who are saying that it was a knockdown. Clearly Cameron has stepped on  Katie's foot then landed the punch, it's very fast but it's Cameron stepping on Katie's!
Past prime at 37 moves up in weight and gets revenge
Irish Taylor gets revenege.first fight should been a draw
Close fight and a great fight.
One judge has it 95-95 another 98-92. That’s quite a different view of it that two of the three judges had. You would have to question what they are looking at sometimes.
Katie ❤
Congratulations Katie taylor ❤
Worriors
Taylor lost clearly. She was gassed by the end of the fight. The crowd, commentators, referee and judges were very biased. Chantelle went and fought like a warrior. This reminds me a lot of Taylor Serrano but this was even more of a robbery than that!
Great boxing, well done Katie T you are truly amazing 🎉
How didn’t they count that as a knockdown? This fight was definitely rigged
All the salty comments saying robbery lol. Katie won more rounds  Landed more shots  Landed cleaner shots  Landed more power shots. Where was the robbery? Katie held a lot and smothered Chantelle’s work yes. Chantelle was hitting the back of her and using her elbows illegally. It’s a fight great scrap from Both ladies but Katie won no robbery.
andy lee fake limerick man
1st round "slip"? That's a knock down. That fixed decision cost Cameron the fight. Should have been an 10-8 round
Even or draw
Chantelle Cameron was robbed.
the gulf in technical ability is as big as the grand canyon, katie by a mile.
Katie has given the best wars in female boxing history. Truly a legend of Ireland unlike any other.
Katie Taylor simply the Best.
Woman fighting is just rancid.
Jonas is boring to watch. Taylor is fun to watch.
Doesn’t seem like I’ve watched the same fight as the commentators
What’s scary is not one person is talking about the decision … that’s what makes it crooked. That clear knock down in the first round 😅
Protected fighter
Maybe shaker stevenson should watch this and learn how to figjt
Ok let me talk about the real deal taylor lost this fight fight if u a real boxing fan you guys can see at first round one knockout  Them taylor was holding this ladies arm, the whole fight she loss big time somebody let me know if im wrong
I thought that was a lot closer than the commentary and judges opinion. Katie is always the best for work rate, but I thought Cameron was more composed and landed the more meaningful punches, some great uppercuts. Overall maybe Katie edged it but only just. I think the years and battles are catching up with her and she'll lose the third fight.
Still a knock down end of
What a fix.....set up nicely for Croke Park.....seen that win coming 6months ago €€€€€€€€€.....Thanks Eddie
Fantastic performance by katie taylor , ill be honest i thought cameron was to big and fresh for her at 37 but she proved me wrong and im glad she did UP KATIE TAYLOR 💯💯👌👌👌
those girls are better at fighting than shakur....pure boxing no running...
Chantelle was aggressor and always had an answer and wasn't trying g to grab
Chantelle won that
Why is the commentator talking like the fight was over and Katie had delivered when needed the most meanwhile entire rounds are ongoing with Katie doing nothing but clinching without any fight in her
Katie taylor gets punched in the face 4 times  The commentators:   what a great flurry by katie taylor
This fight was so frustrating to watch. Way too much grabbing and holding. Let’s have a 3rd fight, but Taylor isn’t allowed to grab and hold every nano second
Fellas take note. This is what we pay to see. Heart, guts and will!  Epic.
The best thing to do when watching a female bout on YouTube is skip to the judges scorecard, saves you alot of time
AWESOME PURELY AWESOME .
Amanda Serrano se las gana a las dos.  Katie Taylor perdió esa pelea, al igual que la anterior.  También perdió contra Amanda Serrano.
98-92?
There should be 8 officials, 2 at each side of the ring to get a more accurate judgement.
KATIE TAYLOR LOST!!!!!!!!!!! ROBBERY
I'm confused here perhaps a re-watch of this bout is in order because it looked like Cameron won.
Pride ,humble, legend, champ-champ 👊
What a mess 😅😅 women boxing, back in the kitchen please..
Nice 👍
What about the boxers wearing different colours next time???
Katie is a goat 🐐
Great fight but struggled to tell who was who with same colours
Katie Taylor held the last 4 rds and purposely head butted Cameron
Katie Taylor is a fraud who got wins throughout her career she didn't deserve!
Cameron and all her mouthing  , she is very quiet now
Hon Katie!
Didn't like Camerons punches to the back of the head. Dangerous
The heart women boxers show is relentless
No interest here.
Was defo a knockdown
Cameron won the rematch in my opinion
An Irish protestant girl and Irish citizen like Taylor being so warmly embraced by the Irish public helps make a united island more likely.
Appalling commentary all favouring Katie they should be ashamed of their bias and their unprofessionalism and I don’t think that KT won. KT is over rated in my opinion and unexciting.
she held the whole fight. she is overrated.
Total respect for chantelle cameron for taking the loss well and chapping at the result👍 . Them woman boxers show the men how it should be taken with  Dignity and respect ❤
I don't watch men's boxing anymore  . The woman are much better to watch 👍👍👍
Great win for Katie Taylor but looking at fight both boxers fought well Cameron will be back
The knockdown was absolutely LEGIT and so this was a draw. Great fight.  They need to go again.
Chantelle would of won if the knockdown was counted, as it should of been. No way was it a slip.
Wow! We need the 3rd fight
Big rob, chamtelle won this fight in my opinion!!!
Chantelle won that fight
A poor fight too much hugging
A Irish living legend 🙌 👏 👌
That just made her that much greater avenging a loss to the bigger Chantelle
Brilliant performance by katie taylor.
And people say women's boxing is boring
Taylor has lose Most of her Fight in carrer  Even against the puertican Woman  Where everyone knows die wantet 3 Minutes round  Katie has No condition notjing
The Fight is a joke Katie was Holding every Rouen After she punchs  A not buy reffere has Made Same Points off  But didnt happen he only Talks to caneron   He was 100 % paid for Katie   So it was Not fair In a Woman Boxing Knockout nesr impossible   So she lose from Round 1
These two ladies making women’s sport great again 🫡
Katie didn't do enough to take those titles back
U beat her all day long katie jst box her stop brawling ur makin it hard for urself
Katie fond of the headbutts 😂
Like 2 amatures winging it , keep boxing katie stop brawling
Well done ladies, what a fight.  Katie did enough to win, fantastic.  Chantelle is also a true champ.
retire with the win she looked old, hesitation, legs are going, slow on the trigger
Absolute robbery the knock down was a knock down that would have made the fight a draw based on the score card read. Two the holding not even a warning disgusting referee. Another gifted win for Katie Taylor.
Was a set up for sure. 100% a clear as day knockdown. But Chantelle didn’t really have a plan B and it cost her. Looking forward to the trilogy, but if it’s in croke park then chantelle might aswell just turn up for the pay day, because she ain’t getting no decision unless KT is pinned to the canvas.
Katie Taylor clearly the Best Woman Boxer ever in the World.  Well Done Katie and Ireland 🇮🇪
By the looks of these highlights Katie LOST
Taylor looked sloppy and fought like she was holding on by a thread. She lost. Announcers are extremely unprofessional. Did someone tell them katie is not fighting a punching bag? These didnt speak her opponents name once!
Keren
Those 2 fighters are absolutely incredible . They fight harder than some of the Men s bouts . My utmost respect for both of them  true champions .  Absolutely AMAZING
That’s a draw 💯
Cameron deserves to keep her belts Katie didn’t do nearly enough plus the commentators was crazy bias
Thought Cameron just edged it by winning the last 3 rounds, but a draw wouldn't have upset anyone, great fight. Don't know what fight the "98-92" Judge was watching, but it certainly wasn't the fight others were watching ! Bring on No3 !!!
☘️🙌☘️🇮🇪👊🏻🇮🇪The Pride Of Ireland 🇮🇪 🙌☘️💚🇮🇪
Taylor looks like she put on serious meat for that fighr
2 minute rounds a big No No , it has to change to 3 minute rounds, then it’s real boxing
100% legit knockdown in round 1 for Cameron but ref ruled it a slip. 10-8 round. Taylor should have been warned and deducted a point for excessive holding and head use also. Terrible ref and messy fight as a result.
Taylor ❤️🙏
I’m sorry Katie Taylor gotten beat up in her last couple of fights including this fight. I just started watching Taylor but I seen her get beat up and nearly knocked out against Amanda Serrano but they robbed Serrano and she lost to Cameron and this fight Cameron was robbed honestly. They even robbed Cameron of her knocked down. Cameron knocked her down with a punch the obvious robberies need to stop it’s crazy
Cameron won that
Fire the commentators they sound so biased
They cheated for Taylor - clearly a knock down
Fight of the year, they should do drug tests on the commentators...
Neither of them have any defence,, every time i watch women' fighting, they never think about the art of hitting without being hit...
WRONG RESULT .Like always the commentator was only shouting for Taylor
Great fight from both BUT… was a definite knock down. The ref was bias. Cameron would have lost a point if she had held onto Taylor’s arm (constantly) like Katie did. Second fight should not have been in Ireland for the 2nd time. Would love to see the 3rd fight scored fairly and on mutual ground (if not Cameron’s choice).
How was that not a knockdown in round 1?
Fantastic fight. Both ladies should be proud.
98 to 92 huh
Wow what a fight!!!!!
punch didn't even land on the head if you watch it hits her collar bone so its arguable
ZZZ, Like slow motion boxing
Noooo  Chantelle was much better
MFN Katie got her lick back!
Alot of Holding from Taylor 🗑🗑🚮 Fight.
Katie is so overrated and privileged it’s disgusting
Fight in london cameron knocks her out
More money for the third fight wat a setup
The  best Boxer Eddie Taylor🎉🎉
Chantelle was robbed !!
Katie is a Irish legend man! I absolutely love this woman
There’s no way she won that fight she was getting hammered
Another robbery for Taylor to steal again just like when Hearn gave Serrano a robbery loss.  That WAS a huge KNOCK DIWN RD1.  Hearn had judges in the bag. The scores were as such that a myriad of options to Rob it were on Eddie hearns table.   What a travesty.  I’m SICK  IM FKN SICK ! Of this BS.   ITS SO UNJUST.  EDDIE HEARN RIGGS THE CARDS MORE THAN DON KING.  ITS A DAMM SHAME.
Seriously one of the best fights iv ever seen, what an atmosphere best supporter's in the world, football, boxing, mma any sport they are unbelievable supporter's
Katie really puched the head off her . Well done katie
For anyone saying it was a knockdown you need to rewatch it. Cameron caught taylor with a jab but not enough to knock her down,  Cameron didnt tread on her foot either. As Taylor moves back from the shot their feet cross and Taylor's left foot clips Camerons Left and rolls which causes the fall. Watch it at 1/4 speed, its clear as day. Wasnt a knockdown but a trip more than a slip.
SERRANO SE LAS GANA A LAS 2
Katie didn’t win. I think a draw would be fair on both fighters. But judges have their favourites
Great contest, very evenly matched but I think Katie wanted it more and deserved it
I guess this is the best time for Serrano rematch
Ref is a scumbag, robbed Cameron of the clear knockdown, which would've had a draw ruling.
Thank you Referi👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Boxing should be banned
Knockdown would’ve made it a draw. This is boxing people.
Am a Cameron fan but could see Taylor was the stronger fighter in this one
Katie Taylor is one of the most electric, intense, entertaining women in all of Boxing!!
Twas a draw
There is (( NO WAY ))  That was a slip in round one (( NO WAY )) Taylor got knocked down by Cameron ..........  A lot of head butting and holding ........ The fix was in .
Could not have been more pleased to see Katie get revenge. It was a close fight, but Katie did enough to clearly win.
If there's a 3rd fight and there should be, it should be in a neutral country.
Very close fight could have gone either way, but the judge who scored it 98-92 must have been watching a different fight, disgraceful scoring.
A very close fight well done to the both of them
What a fight! Toe to toe action from the first to the last round!
Cameron should have won
Complete and utter bias commentary and scoring, exciting fight.
Katie's conditioning needs to be looked at more. Shes like bambi in the 1st few rounds
That was a knock down the ref a cheat
Drunken fight
If Katie lost it would have been a bad look for her country.
Get the third fight locked in for 2024
Where were all the English fans for Chantelle. She got robbed here
why same colour kit both gwomen look similar too - had a hard time working out who was who
I don't agree with the verdict. Chantelle has shown that she is not inferior to Kate, if the winner doesn't use the trick of keeping her opponent in the melee she almost certainly won't finish the match.
How can these judges be so far apart on the scoring
How bias was this commentary?!
I remember when women fight their way to have womens boxing. And now were 3.7M watching.❤
2 massive stars
Handbags n feathers reminds me of Tommy fury fights
Enjoyed this more than any heavyweight fight in the past 10 years. Slug fest till the bell! I'd even watch a 3rd tbf.
Only mentioning Katie Taylor the whole fight. How bias is this. Cameron was getting the better of her
This fight was bs how that wasn’t a knockdown in round one they robbed that poor girl 🤦🏾‍♂️
Robery
Katie is a true Irish, world champion, tough, skill, heart, she's got it all.
Cameron was robbed.. Outrageous...
Cooking show
Wow, incredible!! Great work, Katie!
Taylor definitely lost this fight 😂.  A lot of holding but lost.  Cameron should have known a home cooking was coming.  I would have made Taylor fight in my country and for her belts.
Brave fighters. If you were there, you got your money's worth. Fantastic.
Taylor boring fighter...
Katie is the goat of women’s boxing
you can win a fight by grabbing and hoilding all night.. B.S.
Love Katie, but I'm sorry I didn't see the fight as hers🤔
Why does noone talk about how much Taylor hugs to avoid exchanges??
98_92 what was that referee smoking? 🤡
Upload the full fight please
Great fight better than mens boxing not affraid to stand and trade blows
It was a knock down period
Now I think that Katie Taylor should retire on this high note. She's one of the few champions I know of who wasn't the cocky POS that most newly minted champions tend to become after winning a championship belt.
Awful standard
somewhat biased commentating
🍀💚👍
No3 is gonna be naughty!!
Two ambassadors of women’s boxing. Superstars even.
It was a pretty close fight but I am agree with the 96-94 that was the  right call but Taylor was in survivor mode the las 2 rounds
Easy for Taylor
That was a knockdown in round one
Great fight. But that was a 100% a knockdown. But we all know how boxing has gone..
I love home cooking
Its really sad the great jimmy mcgee isn't alive to see it
lol love all the salty tears saying this wasn’t Katie’s fight, she made the adjustments it was clear as day
Great fight and the announcer at the end maxed out the tension when reading out the results.  Hairs on the back of the neck. The great Katie Taylor!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮
Sad to see the fer determining that was a huuhhh off balance slip up,reminds me of Martínez- Pavlik same situation a punch,off balance down to the floor but they rule it as a knockdown
It is more entertaining to watch the gals fight than the men these days. They give it their all.
Fue una gran pelea, siempre favorecen a taylor creo qué perdió por puntos.
Are commentators allowed to be obviously biased in boxing 😂
It's all about the money! Of course Hearn wants the trilogy - Croke Park, BIG bikkies. The commentators toe the line, whatever fast Eddie wants. I had Taylor winning 96-94 but definitely a knockdown - poor ref. Cameron will rue going back to Ireland - now she has to for a third time.
Commentators very biased
First round was a knockdown but in the end Katie won fair and square on points decision. The second judge who scored the fight 98-92 is a corrupted boxing judge he deserves to be punished he should never ever work as a boxing judge again. Now its 1-1, now a trilogy needs to happen both fighters deserves it. Womens boxing needs a first trilogy fight  to make history and now is a perfect time to do it. The trilogy fight must happen in Croke Park if that is not possible then the fight has to happen in England in a stadium fight. Huge Respect to both fighters. The fight was magnificent and what a magnificent  atmosphere it was. Congratulations Katie Taylor on your win. 👊🥊
Women should not be boxing absolutely ridiculous
Amanda needs to rematch Taylor
Headbutting contest?
When did headbutting and hugging become acceptable?  Also the commentary are shocking u couldn't make it any more blatant
Respect to both ladies - taking the sport onto next level.   Personally I’d love to see the trilogy - both deserve it.
So much brain damage.. is awful.. no defense just punching balls
Should never work again that was a clean knock down
Im katie fan looks like Cameron won
Lots of sore, sore losers commenting here, who obviously don't have much of a clue about boxing. Taylor outclassed, outworked and beat a bigger fighter... In the same way Shields did to Marshall.
Scorecards corruption right there
Excessive clinching and holding in every round but apparently match of the year. Ok then.
How was that not a knockdown 😅
Bias commentators
For me cameron win the fight because taylor is always hug and hug
Better performance by Katie tonight. Congrats..
From what I’ve heard, 98-92 is ridiculous. Still haven’t scored it yet tho
😂😂😂the fighter is always hug and hug win😅😅
I have no idea what people are complaining about Katie Taylor clearly one no doubt about it like what are you complaining about
98-92 is a crazy decision
What a comeback after that 1st fight. Hats off to both girls for that display of boxing.
I could only see that as a draw tbh
Shield's would destroy them both
Well done Katie, be blessed be blessed 🙌.
Not interested in women's boxing 👎👎
Great fight,Cameron was so strong but Katies ring IQ was on point. Well done both.
Hows that not a knockdown
I'm just wondering is this was wrestling or boxing ? Coz from start to end just hugging  🫂
That was some fight that
That knockdown though
How was that not a knockdown on Taylor?
Chantelle won that fight for me maybe by 1 round. She controlled the fight from start to finish. Katie looked scared in the exchanges, and Chantelle was so confident in that fight. She will be thinking how did she beat me. I won that fight.
That was a draw at best
Katie taylors jab is a work of art.
Lot of English tears on hear they'll  end up flooding the sea well deserved win Katie lass from a 37 year old some grit 🍀
Not a subscriber to D.A.Z.N. [Too much money.] No need for a third fight. Katie the best woman boxer in the world no doubt.
No U.K. Lottery funding for Katie. No need when you work so hard.
Certain Bookmakers need to cough up for that knockdown kmt
Great fight 🥊
Katie Taylor The legend confirmed.
Taylor need fight Serrano again
One of the best fights in many years.. 🤛👊
True and the ref was biased against Cameron he called a clear knockdown a slip yea right. If anything it should've been a draw kaity looked gased and was holding on you got to show better to win the belt. Alot of homecoming in this one.
Not to mention The Judge Score Card 💳 98-92 what Fight he Was Watching 😮😮  The Championship Rounds for a Fight Like This is The Last 2 Rounds and Katie Only Succeeded by Holding and throwing a few Punches here and there but Holding Huh
Why is DAZN commentary team so biased it’s pathetic
🎉 KT🍀
Ireland stand up. Another two-weight world champion in combat sports, this time a woman. One of the greatest athletes to ever come out of this country and the greatest female boxer in history.
What a brilliant fight shame the men don’t give so much heart!
Taylor is 🗑
Heart of a lion has katie against a bigger, stronger fighter. Congratulations.
Deffo a knockdown in R1
Hometown decision without any doubt whatsoever.
Gutted for Cameron. It’s 1:1 now. Hope we get to see a trilogy bout.
Can we have a moment for the atmosphere, Saudi doesn't give us this
How is that not a knock down????????
The atmosphere in the 3 arena last night was something else, what a woman,  incredible fight
Chantelle consistently threw shots after the bell
Katie's hit and hold worked in this fight, but didn't deserve the wide points victory, except in Ireland.
What a fix you can tell it was in Ireland  I must have watched a different fight....
That was a flash knockdown 😢🤦🏿‍♂️cheated on that one
whose idea was it to dress them both in black?????? 🤷‍♀🤷‍♀
Oh and I forgot about The Referee Allowed to many Headbutt  Few Unintended but way to many clashed Headbutt SUSPICIOUS
Questionable result considering the ref didn't acknowledge the knockdown!
Sorry but you knock your opponent down and totally dominate with jabs and yet you lose because the script was already written WHAT A JOKE AND A DISGRACE CAMERON CLEARLY WON
This gave me absolute goosebumps great fight both champs
Katie is hot aswell.
I didn't see that coming. Respect to the heart she has.
This was a joke Cameron dominated
Cameron won this.
Someone explain to me how that wasn't a knock down. Minutes 2:04
Rematch with amanda
Katie got more heart then shakur both these women FIGHT LIKE WARRIORS While alot of the men running & dancing around smh  Im start Coving for Women Fights Because seem! They the ones who actually want to give the fans A SHOW!
Cameron won
Well done Katie!! Raising the spirits of our nation ❤
What a champ , katie taylor.
That was a draw in my opinion from the highlights, one of the rounds should’ve been a 10-8 for Cameron that was a knock down caught Taylor with that stiff jab, other than that what a fight kudos to both ladies 🥊🔥🔥
Both women were unbelievable.. Warriors..
Part 3 is waving... slugfest figth..
Awesome KATİE...So much Thanks Katıe...For nice movıe...
First round was definitely a 10-8 to Cameron..
What counts as a knock down these days 🤔
Love you katie ❤💕
Bias commentators...great crowd great fight
Great fight. Close and difficult to score. Congratulations to both but much respect to Cameron for the proud acceptance of the result...
I will have to watch the whole fight, from these highlights I could not see a case for a Taylor win, all I heard was the commentators saying KT name all the time. KT clearly lost to Serrano, lost to CC first time round and from these highlights did not seem dominant at all. But as said need to see the whole fight first.
WOW Katie Taylor is SPECIAL , its no defeat/failure that defines us - ITS HOW WE GET BACK UP
Wow!, what a fight from start to finish, best women's boxing match for a long time, toughest opponent of Katie by far. Will there be a 3rd fight? If Katie retire now Cameron will hold that belt for long time.
The crooked boxing game.  The punters are being taken for ride.
Bias commentary as f*ck man
why are they putting fake sound effect from the crowd on this fight?
Bad referee, biased scoring won out last night . 97-94 Cameron easy . Taylor threw judge impressing flurries which were ineffective. Scoring is supposed to be based on four factors one of which is Clean Effective Punching . Just because the crowd hometown crowd cheers doesn’t necessarily mean that the punches were landing cleanly. Taylor should’ve been deducted at least a point for excessive holding and the ref clearly missed ruling a knockdown for Cameron in round 1 . I am surprised at how Cameron supported the decision at the end . Maybe she protested later in the post fight but I didn’t watch any of the interviews afterwards. I’d like to see the trilogy match . Imo unfinished business.🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Katie Taylor is the goat.
Knockdown called a slip 💀
How was that not scored a knockdown? 😮
Same hair, same top, same shorts FFS
Chantell is a much stronger fighter katie lands a combo then holds straight after because chantell keeps coming for her
When her career is over Netflix 100% need to do a documentary about her life! What a champion what a fighter!
Well done girl, couldn’t be prouder 🇮🇪💯💪
Cameron stood on Katie's foot in round one it wasn't a Knockdown
Nice Christmas gift Taylor from DAZN😜👍
Two warriors.
Katie taylor should have had points taken off for holding it’s insane how the ref just ignored it
98-92🤔
Dazn fight nights very poor. What do you expect from Eddie Hearn?
10 2 minute rounds is such a cop out
Serrano better not fight katie in Ireland. Serrano deserved the win in NY but 8-2 for katie after this fight? That judge belongs in a woodchipper. I can't think of a single scorecard in any of Taylor's fights that weren't generous, kind of like every canelo card. What boxer doesn't get low cards occasionally? The math is impossible. Always a criminal card and the rest are all generous.
Finally some decent boxing 👏🏻
What a fight! Best I’ve seen this year! So proud of them both. Compare that to the men’s heavyweight scene!! 🙄 HUGE RESPECT 🙏❤️🙏
Please retire now Katie you have proved  your a great
Well, I wanted Talor to win but  I thought the knockdown was legitimate. After watching the replay several times over it seems that Cameron stood on Taylor`s foot as the punch landed on her shoulder area which may have contributed to the knockdown. A very debatable incident.
Taylor wins by holding on and scores points for head butts and running away, she is an absolute disgrace, time to retire taylor............
Big heart from Taylor, but Cameron wins number 3, better fighter
Definitely  a knockdown, dubious clash of heads, Taylor roughed Cameron up. Rematch Cameron wins.
Great fight.  There will be a rubber match but I think she owes serrano a rematch first .
I prayed u win .
Hope u get ur belts bsck
Well done cathy very happy for u .well done
Watching these high lights looks like katie taylor lost
Definitely one of boxing's superstars.  Not just women's boxing but boxing in general, like Serena Williams in tennis.  Clarissa Shields is also on her way with just 14 fights.
What a great fight
Katie was holding,and nothing done by the referee. Just awful. Run it back!
🤣🤣🤣🤣 The brits are crying again 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪💣
All these comments make me sick because u are all the reason Taylor wont fight Serrano again. Scared and knowing we do not bend....... history will never change between us lol 😂✌🏾
To much holding from taylor.
98-92?????
Don't change the fact that Taylor and her team don't want Serrano no more!😂
How was that a slip in round 1 🤷🏼‍♂️ defo punch n knocked off her feet 🤷🏼‍♂️
Katie is magnificent, of that there is no doubt. Two division, undisputed! However, the ref robbing Cameron of the knockdown is unforgivable.
A pretty close fight. It certainly sets up a big Pay Day for both of them in the 3rd and final fight.
How was that not a knock down in the first,  may not have hurt her but was not a slip
Absolutely incredible fight! Let’s have the trilogy.
Rip boxing
No way she won that fight,  home result and a fix 😢 and the knock down in the frist round what a joke😢
Both ladies should be extremely proud of their performances. Two absolute warriors. Well done.
DEFINITE KNOCK DOWN!!!!!
98 to 92 ???????
The best women’s boxer of all time. Congratulations to Katie a true warrior and champion and now a two weight champion. Better pony up for Croke Park now Eddie no excuses after these two showed they’re worth it twice now
Not one mention of Taylor’s blatant head work or incessant clinching cowardly biased commentary  🤬🤬🤬
The judge who scored the fight a draw should be sanctioned a disgrace.💪💪💪💪
The most biased commentary I’ve ever witnessed 🤣
Taylor looks half the size of her opponent, great fight
Key example of " taking 1 to be able to give a few " 🔥
What about the knock down the ref is f
got to be a third fight surely !
Rigged. 98-92??? She looked gassed the entire time and hugged every round. She's whack.
Well done Katie that was epic
No knockdown? Katie has Fury privilege
Shakur needs to take notes . Even the ladies had a better performance
Great fight
Looked like a legit knockdown and, from the highlights at least, like a Cameron win?
Serious bias towards Taylor even though the fight was close. She also got dropped in the first with a legit jab no question.
Great fight and Well deserved Win for Katie
Clinching Clinching !
Come on 👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Boxing stinks of corruption
Never thought women's boxing would reach this level, what a fight  both hard as granite hope Kate retires nothing to prove anymore.
2 of thee best female boxers in the world ❤❤❤
Home town decision
Not to much skill on show, Taylor wants  to hug all night and the rest is basically a brawling contest.
Fair play to both men 👏
98/92????  Robbed On That Card.... Smh...
Great fight. Annoying they were both wearing black.
Knocked down in first round 😅
Great fight....thought Katie won, albeit one of the cards was way off IMO. Also thought that it was a knockdown in R1, but that wouldn't change the outcome.  Chantelle , like Katie is a warrior.
Could They Hug Anymore???
I thought Cameron should of had her armed raised! And the commentary was disgusting,
I thought 96 v 94 was too close and the judge who scored it a draw was delusional. Cameron was put back in her place...out worked and outclassed by a much smaller fighter. She knew this an resorted to throwing shoulders and elbows, punching after the bell and constantly whinging (a trait passed on from Jamie Moore.
Unfortunately, Cameron was robbed, definitely a knockdown. Although Taylor made adjustments and has the heart of the lion, Cameron is the superior boxer and adged this fight. Even the Dazn highlights couldn't make it look  like a win for Taylor. Extremely bias commentating from Dazn.
Brilliant from both fighters but Katie Taylor is special
Shocking commentary. Just listen. At the beginning Taylor was getting punched up. Bad. Battered. They said nothing. Taylor lands a little shot. They start praising her and go mad. All you hear from them is Katie this and Taylor that. Embarrassing. Close fight. Taylor may of knicked it by a point. Fair play to her in the later rounds. If you know boxing. Then you already know it's bought and paid for.  But that biased commentary has me laughing so hard. Then you add the crowd in with it.  Business as usual.
That was CLEARLY a knock down in the first..😂😂😂😂
Taylor with another gift from referee and judges. Commentators might as well be paid by her camp 😂
Disgusting commentary, which was so one-sided. Even going by the highlights, it was clear Cameron's punches had way more affect than Taylor's. Credit to both women & a great fight. A blatant knockdown was ignored. I can see an argument for a draw, but not a Taylor win. Hopefully we get a trilogy.
Great fight but that was defo not a slip in the earlier rounds 😂
Go on girls what a fight!
Picked Chantelle to win again but have to congratulate Katie on turning it around and becoming a 2 weight undisputed champion,  maybe they should have another fight for the trilogy.
How many times is this woman gonna burst my heart with pride!!!! 💚💚💚💚🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Why was the knockdown not counted???? Very strange
I think the ladies leave their soul and heart in the ring than most of the men.  Fight of the year right there for me!!!! Katie and Cameron I LOVE YOU
That’s no champion. It’s all about the hype. Taylor needs a new boyfriend. Majority decision? 😂😂😂🫵🫵
If you swapped the performances of the fighters around, Taylor would still have won the fight on the scorecards
Cheated out Cameron had little chance. It’s sad to see everything stacked against her. I love both fighters but it’s sad to see
Well done Katie what a night ☘️
98-92 what? 😂  Also that was a knockdown.   Otherwise, close fight and great fight!
Even though it was a great fight, I thought Cameron look a bit off. All she did the whole fight was march straight into tailor hands up.
who says girls cant fight wow what a fight!
Commentators only spoke about Taylor's moments, they were very one sided. 98 - 92 was a joke. Taylor just about took that fight.
Pay CASH EVERYWHERE you go, NO kard or phone payment whatsoever people, ditch the phones and JUST SAY NOOO.
Corrupt, that was a knockdown
I got to puuuuuuup
Looked like Cameron won to me very biased commentary
Deffo knockdown
Biased commentary
98-92 !!!!!!! Stevie Wonders scorecard 🤔🤔🤔
Wait until they go up against men!....i mean shemales LoL
This was a close fight but lets be honest, Taylor had a lot of controversial victories... Boxing is corrupt
👏👏👏👏🥊🥊🎉🎉
Taylor holding all night,  poor performance by the referee letting it go, she should have been deducted points.
Absolute garbage. Can't punch for toffee.. Freak show
Those scorecards were filled in before the fight started
Hace falta un tercero antes de ver la pella pensaba en una victoria por los puntos de taylor y viendo lo mejor del combate esperando verlo completo sigo pensando lo mismo los golpes de taylor son mas claros aunque golpeé menos
What a brilliant fight. 👊🏻
This is not boxing this is brawling
Rematch should of been in England ,biased commentators and that was a knock down .
What a fight! 💯 And what a great immediate response from Cameron, when the "sentence" was pronounced.  Two champions in one ring.
I sat here for a second or two when the score cards were read out. Great fight, respect to both.
Proper old school style boxing a real pleasure to watch two gladiatrix's of the sport
Katie clinch taylor wins again if she never held so much shed be on the canvas lovely women tho tbf
That knock down should’ve been counted
Cameron very sloppy puncher
98-92  ridiculous. Great fight. Had taylor winning in really close fight. Shame about another corrupt/incompetent judge tho
Cant score the fight of them highlights only sore 40 seconds a round
Taylor lost that fight judges in hearns pocket absolutely disgusting
Fixed, how can one judge be 6 points ahead and another call it a draw.
Chantelle won 8-10 , but that's all. Great fight from both
😮that was a real War Millions 💰and Millions 💰now for a decider 👏👏👏🥊🥊☘️☘️☘️
I had it as a draw but congratulations to both fighters. Amazing contest and well done Katie Taylor.
Totally biased commentary because it’s DAZN. it was a knockdown also. The head clashes. They were awful. I don’t like to see that but hey where’s there’s a lot of money theres letting things slide. Cameron won the last 3 rounds for me.
Strong performance from both Fighters and well deserved win for K Taylor. Tho I definitely don’t agree with one of the judges scoring 98-92 for KT and one of the judges scoring a draw thefuq he been smoking?
Awful fight this too watch
I hope Taylor is OK after all though punches to the back of the head in the clinches
Taylor did not win that fight no way
I'm completely stalled in women's boxing now into they did 12x3 rounds at this level.
Amazing, she should call it day now.
Run it again 3rd time
I would have easily given this to Cameron, a lot of hugging from Katie she was gassed towards the end. That scorecard was an embarrassment
Don't really care or have any allegiance to either fighter but the two things I saw clearly are it WAS a knockdown and the commentary was ridiculously bias , both fighters absolute warriors and imo it was a draw
Heart doesn't score points 😞 but it does for her😂😂😂😂😂She got downed round one
Cameron was robbed...that was a knock down in round 1
Why did the referee not say nothing about Taylor holding?
Never seen two women beat the hill outta each other like that !
Respect lady’s awesome fight credit to you both the real deal ❤️🥊🙏😱👋🏻👋🏻
Taylor has lost atleast 3 fights. The partizan crowds, judges and commentators are getting her these wins.
Never a knockdown, she stood.on KT foot
I see that all the negative comments are being removed. Utter disgrace of a decision. You are destroying boxing with this garbage.
That’s what you call , doing your homework.
I'm a KT fan but that commentary was shockingly biased
Cameron won the fight
True champion ❤
Very close defo was a knock dwn
Great fight that, looked like a legit knock down in the beginning
Give it up to the Brave Women Fighting. Applause!
It should have been a Split Draw
Atleast make them wear different outfits. Hard following who's who.
I love Katie Taylor but she didn't win that fight. The 98-92 judge may as well have handed in the card before the fight and gone to the pub.
Superb, close fight. Taylor always going to clinch the decision in Dublin…
Hard to believe so many watched this cat fight...
We all know watching that Taylor barely survived, not sure that's a convincing win for me and she grabbed a lot just to stay In there, you take away the grabbing and I think she gets stopped
It was very different to the first fight. Last time, Cameron was dominant but also clean and tidy, this time she was inaccurate and at times sloppy. Just didn't look as slick and on point. I agree with other comments about Taylor holding, it's a disgrace, she's got away with it for years. I think the result was fair as an outcome though how the judge who scored massively in Taylor's favour was scoring it, I have no idea. I do think it's now time that Taylor hung up the gloves. Yes, she's done a lot and been a warrior, but she also is 37 and has taken a lot of beatings over many fights.
Wasn’t a legal knockdown slow it down and pause it Cameron was standing on top of her foot Wich caused her to not be able to balance
*PUNCH STATS [Compubox]*                       *Jab*      *Power*     *Total*   *Taylor*      15/88      74/200      89/288  *Cameron* 26/108    57/147     83/255
Disgusting commentary yet again
Shame she didnt have her belts on line first fight
Katie lost that fight and that knock down was a knock down from a punch! That should have been a round for Cameron but the ref cheated her of the knock down, you don't knock somebody off their feet and the ref waves it off! Something was afoot!
Wat a robbery
This was not camerron. She was 30%
Puts male boxing to shame.❤
Well done Katie, you did'nt get bullied this time, Has to be a third and deciding fight  Katie after you win that one time for you to retire!
The fight should have been in England, Camerons home ground. Great fight but don't know what the 2nd judges score was
Que basura se ha vuelto el boxeo 🥊🥊 Cameron Win
couldnt even find highlights to make it look like katie won this 🤦‍♂same thing every exchange, swings wildly - takes more damage - initiates the clinch. Effective punches HAS to mean something in boxing, not just shots landed. Serrano and now Cameron havent looked phased in any of their fights with Katie, yet Katies holding on for dear life nearly every round. Judges and commentators swayed by the crowd and Eddie's future plans. Do better boxing 😩
She will 🦆 Caroline Dubois 💯
Throw 3 quick jabs and hold all fight that style is not for me Cameron is better and never looked in trouble all fight
It is bad enough seeing a guy battered after a long fight, but seeing a woman is just too much. What does it say about our society that we pack an arena to see women brawling? Katie would make a lovely mother. I hope she retires and focuses on making a family.
Maybe a draw. Commentary was crazy bias here. Great fight though.
Third fight in Chantelle Camerons hometown
Two 'real' world champions, women boxers who can actually fight. More than I can say for the other pathetic excuses for boxers who have won belts recently.  Cameron looked 2 weight classes above Taylor, which made the win even more impressive. CONGRATULATIONS KATIE TAYLOR!!
Class the one judge was way off she clearly won well done Katie 👍🦊
This was a terrible fight. Entertaining, yes. But not the form you'd expect from 'the best ladies fighter'.
What a war, what a legend, Katie Taylor. I feel she's had the Hollywood finish there if she were to sensibly retire now at 37 being a double undisputed champ.
Well done Katie warrior 👏👏
Watch without sound
Joshua and fury would do well to watch this
Taylor lost !!!! Again !!!
Can Taylor now be considered the best ever women fighter…?
how wasnt that a knock down in round 1? :S
Some engine on those ladies, great fight
You can see by the comments that most fans didn't even see the fight. It was a terrible fight and Katie Taylor looked horrible. Non-stop clinching and at least 3 headbutts. It was obvious Fast Eddie had sorted out everything with Judges, Referees and Commentators.
Fight of the year nomination
Coaching a lady must be very challanging, her emotions can easily lead her away from the game plan.
I’m sorry but Katie did not win 🏆 that fight. Cameroon should scored a knockdown and the judges were swayed only the blood on Cameron’s face
Goosebumps what a warrior Katie is for ireland well done you make ireland proud. Katie irelands number one daughter
👏🏻👏🏻🇮🇪
Unbelievable
Taylor takes one straight on the chin and the commentators are like look at how Taylor blocked that with her face. So biased.
Lot of Katie Taylor haters about .She outclassed and won by a mile .up the Irish .
Better than the men...well done Katie you're amazing 👏
Well done Katie. I had you written off, how wrong was I. 👏👌
Ridiculous that wasn’t called a knockdown by the way
Nothing bit hugs and butts from Taylor
As always massively biased towards Katie😂, the coverage, the officials, the commentary etc She’s been great for women’s boxing but has been on the end of some very questionable scoring in the past, but she’s a course professional. This wasn’t a great fight at all, despite what the commentary team were implying, it was scruffy and very tight.
The amount of holding by Taylor is unbelievable
I thought Katie was well beaten in the first fight but she was phenomenol last night, nobody is beating her when shes in that form, credit too Chantelle Cameron aswel, a warrior
After the recent riots in Dublin, the powers that be weren't going to risk  inciting another. Barring a Cameron  knockout, the referees were not letting Taylor lose this fight.
Unbelievable bias commentary.
Katie did brilliant preformance, but hope she retires now on a high.
Haha that 98-92 score card is absolutely scandalous. Fight was epic, both going at it. Cameron the better fighter imo and that was definitely a first round knockdown. Draw may have beek the fair result but i was leaning towards Cameron.
Robed, Robed , Robed
1st round knock-down not counted. Agree fight should be in neutral areana.
They were never going to let Taylor lose that. Not to say it was a robbery, it was a close fight that could go either way. But when the ref doesnt call a clear kd and you get an horrendous card that was so wide it doesnt do her any favours. That refs been swayed by the crowd or paid off, shocking.  Very unlucky for Cameron, could easily have won that fight. But fighting taylor there is like fighting canelo in mexico, you're gonna start 3 or 4 rounds down without the first punch being thrown.
What a fight two animals
Corrupt that was a defo knockdown in the first that would make the fight a draw
that was a knockdown. smh
All I see is an exausted Taylor who hugs constantly. I also hear bias commentator. Sheessh
Forget Irish or men's boxing, that was one of the best most exciting fights EVER!
What were the commentators watching? Thought Taylor was hanging on for dear life in the later rounds
Cameron had relentless pressure but kept walking into combinations!! Which loss her the fight !! Katie looses gas in the last rounds .. that’s when fighters need to capitalize!!
Absolute robbery. Chantelle won. Also she is hotter than Cameron so that is at least +2 on the scorecards.
Taylor is getting tired so fast and she is not strong
Tyson Fury watch and learn! Thats real boxing. Not pantomine pretending to be boxing. Your a Fraud.
Fixed no way you can tell me taylor outboxed her opponent
Knockdown should have counted.
Congratulations Katie your our Hero and I don’t think RTE give you the Recognition you deserve.👏👏❤️🇮🇪
The commentary is absolutely awful! So biased.
She deserved this win 🔥
This is like two football teams wearing the same kit.
Can’t wait for the trilogy
Cameron IS best she Always attack
Nah man…. I thought it was a draw. No horse in the race . Unbiased. That was dead even
Really scrappy fight , the only one throwing correct punches was Cameron, pitter patter , hold from Taylor every round .  Commentary was an absolute joke and only saw one fighter in there , a draw about right , point off for holding and the kd scored a win for Cameron. It wasn't a classic , don't pretend it was.
I guess we just always come back strong you will never beat the irish ❤ 🇮🇪
Awesome Katie. Women’s boxing skill is catching up with men’s.
Why dont these female boxers trans and fight the men? They don't have bo0bs anyway.
What a clown this ref is how the f**k can that NOT be a knock down. If your off balance it has NO relevance. Get rid of this idiot he is a proper useless waste of space. Cameron was robbed here boxing is so CORRUPT.
Couldn’t tell who was who in the ring, both black and gold colours
Wot a tear up wow
When Eddie earn a fortune on a 2 averige fighters,promotion hype is everything I don't see much talent there!
What a barn stormer!!! Great, close fight! 1 each now
Katies neck muscles unreal
Since you are all Irish in the comments and clearly bias, just firstly let me say I wanted Katie to win but she clearly should have had a point taken for consistent holding and that was not a win it was a draw I think. Glad she gets the win though.
Taylor got dropped an was just hugging an head butting all night long .. awful fight to watch Taylor is massively overrated she gets so lucky wonder why hills 😬😂
Most biased commentary I’ve ever heard Cameron never had a chance
I need to watch the whole fight because these highlights look like the fight was a draw. It wasn't clear to me that Katie won. The crowd was going crazy every time Katie landed a punch but she getting hit at the same time, and all that grabbing was unnecessary.
What a horrible display from Taylor. Looked alright for the first 4 rounds (despite the knockdown) then all she did was hug at every opportunity and go in head first. Should’ve been a draw or if anything Cameron to win. I always thought the challenger needs to show a convincing display of dominance to get the nod over the champion….oh not Katie Taylor in Ireland 😂
Taylor is a well-on-target puncher esp with the combinations and that makes her a well deserved match winner....respect for both Women though 🥊
Amazing fight. Both was amazing to watch, well done Katie 🤛🏽
See the knockdown at 2:02 in super slow motion by going to settings cog and playback speed, then choose like 0.5 speed. Their feet are nowhere near each other. Well done to Katie but that was a knockdown!
If you turn down the annoying noise of the crowd and the biased commentary, I had Cameron winning, she got a legit knockdown too.
Better than most men I've seen fight this year. Great fight.
суди позор😡
The judges definitely on the take for one to be so far out shows it was a rort and not saying she didn’t deserve victory but was guaranteed
Couks you get the commentary any more bias
I thought Taylor should  have retired 3 fights ago, but the Taylor who turned up last night was different class.  That wasn't fight of the year, it was one of the very best woman's bouts I've ever watched.
What a pair of warriors, fantastic!!!!
Firstly, great to see the women want to take on the best, unlike the  men who keep ducking one another. Secondly, Katie's hand speed was unreal and given she insisted this rematch was still at super lightweight, that's to be applauded. Finally, if there was ever an argument for 12, 3 minute rounds, this was it. It would reduce the chances of the head clashes and cuts, given they feel they have to stand toe to toe when it's only 2 minutes. Let's see their boxing skills too! Plus it's for undisputed! Come on! Hope they get the trilogy fight and it's 12, 3 minute rounds. That would be class. Well done to both fighters.
What an amazing fight!
Honestly, I'm finding myself enjoying Women's Boxing more than Men's Boxing lately.
Clear to see kt plan run rounf the ring all night she comes close hold then hold again feel for caneron commentators didnt praise her at all hardly and the knockdown was legit watch it slow mo clear to see
Now that's a fight.
Another very close fight. Katie did enough to edge this one. Well done Katie Taylor, great role model.
Awesome fight. Both fighters deserve all the accolades they will be receiving. Personally I couldn’t call it either way. Looking forward to the decider if and when it happens.
Well done Katie, I wish Andy Lee would relax stop interrupting in commentary and let the main commentator get on with it.
Both looked identical hard to be a judge even the commentator said great 3 punch combo by Katie but it wasn't her who threw them proves a point shouldn't be allowed to wear same outfit
Am i one of the small few who thinks katie should be undisputed cuddle champion constantly holding and was a clear knock down the ref was awful last night
The ref was terrible in this fight. Taylors holding was excessive and was not even warned.
Shocking comms, so incredibly biased for Taylor. I had her just winning but it was ridiculous at times, not one mention of her constant holding. In the US she might have had two or three points taken off.
Taylor was sensational fair play to the woman.  A true Irish great
I’ll call that a fix Taylor head-butts all the time referee don’t do nothing about it. Cameron one all day long boxing is fixed.
Clear to say reff was a bad and changed the motivation on Cameron clear to days
Credit to both  Awesome fight, sound be nice to see the women doing 12x3 now as would be interesting to see the result. Cameron looked like she had more in the tank
Fair play to Cameron for fighting Taylor twice in Ireland..I mean Cameron was the champ and surely one fight should be in her backyard🤔 Not sure i agree with the decision but seems taylor always gets them..remember the serrano fight when she got spanked. Nevermind croke Park for the next one, how about England somewhere..fairs fair. Oh thats right its Eddie and dazn..always the same.
People genuinely think they could do this for 36 minutes. No chance.
Crowd, ref bias commentary everything was against Cameron. She done so well and watch with the sound down it becomes such a different fight. Taylor actually lunged a few times with her head and didn’t once get told to stop holding. Her flurries were just touching the outside of Cameron’s gloves a lot and not hitting Cameron. I hope Taylor has to come to Cameron’s backyard next.
The bias of the commentators towards Klinchie Taylor was hilarious
I’m an Englishman and glad we saw Katie win. Humble and inspirational woman. I also don’t like what Chantelle Cameron done in first fight in preventing the other girl fighting for world title because Shane McGuigan was training her. Go on Katie!
Shouldve been a draw, too many dodgt decisions of recent. This, Fury Ngannou, Usyk Dubois, Catterall Taylor.. i could go on. The sport is rigged and promoters cashcows always get the benefit.
Was such a shame the commentator tried to it about himself and the Malcom x level speech
Katie brings respect, grace and viewership to womens boxing. Heart of a lion, well deserved champ.
The commentary 😂 they think theyre watchiing ali vs frazier 2.
Most bias comentary I’ve ever heard
Cameron, as expected, was robbed. The writing was on the wall as soon as the ref refused to count that legit knockdown in the 1st round. No way was Cameron getting this on the scorecards. Taylor was allowed to clinch excessively throughout the fight without penalty. Ridiculously Taylor-biased commentary. Cameron's own fault really - she should have insisted on having this fight anywhere other than in Ireland. I bet she doesn't get the rubber match!!
Great fight. Respect to these warriors. One small thing, I can’t agree with the judge who scored it 98-92. Also, the first round, I saw it as a knock out, I wonder if anybody else saw that? I can’t see it as a slipping 🤷
2:02 Knockdown 😮???
Great fight the first judge had it about right could have gone either way though 96-92 is laughable and yes commentary was rather biased I thought.
98/92 🤐
Another fix
Very proud of you Katie. You did your homework and got an A+. Bualadh Bos 🥊
Wow
2 women at the very top of their game, and a credit to their sport. 👌🏼
Great fight but if this was Lawrence okolie, he would have heen docked points for all the holding Katie was doing. Plus the denied knock down. But looking forward to round 3
You are amazing Katie. I'd rather watch you fight than any male boxer.
I have my doubts about the referee.  How come he didn't make the countdown after KT fell down to the punch of CC?
Great fight, but I wish the commentators would PULL THEIR TONGUES OUT OF TAYLORS BACKSIDE
Katie lost if you as me
Someone sort out the ring gear next time. The only diference was the boots and you rarely see them in a fight.
Commentary was biased af. Cameron is a beast at 37 years of age
hitting after the match ending gong is defeat cameron admitted defeat there👎
Congratulations, perfect match. Congratulations to the two athletes. Taylor is the champion👊😎
Wow.. What a fight! Those engines on both fighters are crazy.
Neither fighter deserved to lose that fight. First judge had it spot on, second judge was watching another fight
Congratulations to Katie, but how was that not a knockdown.
Well deserved!!!
Fight number 3 am all for it let these women fight every year 🔥🔥
1-1 now lets get it on in engkand its only fair. Commentary was shockimg. Camerom was tryijg to hard imo.That was a kmockdown too.
Most biased commentary ever tbh I think she nicked it but never by 6 rounds
Great fight. Was a knockdown. Commentary bias. Taylor holding a lot. Not a clear victory.
Katie boxed the head off her different class
That was a knockdown
Waw, two amazon great fights. So Cameron is very here your time is came champ. Congratulations Taylor.
Great fight but chantelle robbed of a knock down
A lot of headbutting by Taylor
TRILOGY ANYONE ??
98-92?
She won by holding and headbutting.
A fix ,Kate Taylor didn't win the fight.
This fight looks like it got for fans than the benavidez vs Andrade 🤣🤣
Katie Taylor has heart, what a fighter she’s ✊🏿. Trilogy would do it, big up to Cameron as well, she gave it all too, Taylor’s defence and movement made it difficult for her to land.
Great woman of Al time Katie your the best and you deserve it
Great fight but clear knock down, what is wrong with these refs today 😂
Better than the male heavy weight fights have been for a long long time.
That was a robbery 🔫🥊
These ladies be fighting way better than the men
Yessssssss katie ❤ ireland 🇮🇪
Cameron deserves another chance this was way too close a draw was meaningful to me
Wow just wow ima pul that straight back to the start
A lot of boxing fan boys in these comments saying this was a great fight or fight of the year just because it’s women’s boxing the fight was scrappy and boring no knock downs nothing really exciting but let’s just say what everybody else is saying so it looks like I no about boxing 😂😂
Should fight for the third time
Very biased commentary
The right decision was made… not sure about the scores but overall decision 👌🏻
Undisputed champ in two weight classes. How is she not the Greatest woman boxer alive
Corruption at its best
Gwan Katie, props to Cameron too great fight .
Robbery !
Best boxing match av seen aw year 👌🤣
96-94 Taylor or 95-95 that’s fine. Taylor very tired in final rounds, that happened vs Serrano too. She needs work on her physical condition
Trilogy
Cameron is a dog what a fighter!!she always keep coming forward ..
Eddie Hearn does it again ... hahahaha ,
Ermmmm something fishy about this fight, I wonder what...😅😢
Now that was a fight. Respect.
Anyone thinking same as me about that fight it might just save boxing 😅
What a fight well done both 🤜🤛
Womens boxing is just brawling. No skill
However, Cameron has taken away all the certainties of Taylor as a perfect boxer... Taylor suffers a lot from even not too strong attacks, she is constantly in the clinch and often staggers. He has always fought at home and never in England where obviously he would lose. The commentator is shameful. I think Cameron is a smarter and tidier boxer than Taylor
Katie keep getting xmas presents from corrupt boxing companies
What a fight thats boxing at its best well done to both
in 10 years of watching boxing ive never heard such a biased commentary. I know they want their fighter to win but while katie looked exhausted after the 6th round, just tried to clinge hold and hang on. They made it look she dominated every single seccond. Every punch katie threw was commented like she threw a knockout punch. 98 to 92 ?? Events like this are the reason boxing cant be taking serious.
What a fight!!
This is much better than charlo vs Benavides .  Give these girls more money.
Terrible ref. How can anyone claim that was not a knock down. Absolutely ridiculous
That was a tear up
These dude are tough!
No knockdown. Katie got stepped on & when she pulled back she fell. Yes she was hit when she pulled away & so it looks like a knockdown
Wow brilliant fight from these 2
Taylor is a puzxy Camerón was the winner
Absolute class  Puts the men's classes to shame a proper scrap , heart , skill and the crowd cheering every punch  OUTSTANDING
If the Refs going to score the knock down a slip you suspect the script has already been written! Highlights suggest Cameron entitled to feel a bit hard done by for me partisan crowd & commentary nicked it.
Way more entertaining than shakur fight 😂
British judges are wack!!!
Chantelle won that fight clearly
Home town decision 👌👌
Not been funny but fight of the year boxing is at rock Bottom at least the queen of boxing takes back her crown what a fight Katie Taylor is a warrior
Ref was absolutely shocking! That was a clean punch that knocked Katie off balance, he rules it a slip. Katie was excessively holding the entire fight and also coming In with headbutts. Not even a single warning let alone a point taken off. Big up Katie, but that was far from a convincing and clean win and had the knockdown counted and a point taken off (which I've seen Refs deduct for less) maybe the outcome would have been different.
Talk about Fury. Talk  about AJ. these two girls put the both to shame . Katie wasn't up for the first fight but she certainly  was for this one. A great fight AGreat Fight. Well done Katie.
Women boxers have such little power
CC was robbed of a knockdown
If they would have counted that as a knock down, it might have toasted her motivation for the remainder of the fight. It was clearly a fixed fight folks 😞
What a fight...!!!super exciting match compared to haney,mayweather,and shakur
Cameron abandoned his most potent punch that does the most damage to Taylor. Body punch. It’s totally absent tonight.
I thought Cameron got that, but I'm happy for Katie.
The commentators are so biased it crazy.
Judge scoring 98-92 should be kicked by a mule!!! It was a great fight but really biased including the announcers. Cameron did enough to retain her title as the aggressor. Looking forward to the Trilogy! 👍🏻👊
Another call for the looser
2:03 clean knockdown, don’t think Katie won this fight.
SERRANO WILL BEAT TAYLORAND CAMERON.   REMATCH I WOULD LIKE.    THEY KNOW
Terrible watch
To all the haters,  dont ever doubt Katie again.... respect to both fighters.... Katie,  welcome to the two weight undisputed club with Crawford and Clarissa
Katie, the queen of gift decisions, wins
Going by these highlights I don't see how 2 judges gave it so convincingly to Taylor.
98-92? Shameful. And it was a genuine knockdown…
KATIE LOST….BUT THEY HAD TO GIVE HER THE WIN…ANOTHER ROBBERY
Incredible effort from both boxers a real credit. I had trouble telling who was who as they both gave 100% and looked very similar wearing the same colours.  Surely fight three will be next. Puts mens heavyweight boxing to shame.
I’ve been saying it for years, anything involving Eddie Hearn is corruption, obvious and blatant ref and judging tampering, everyone, come over to showtime
Katy lost that fight just clitching and got hurt multiple times but it was in her backyard so what did we expect
Def was a knockdown and no warning for clinches? The commentators were extremely bias letting headbutts go knockdowns
98-92 ridiculous scorecard! And that knockdown that wasn't counted would of changed the fight!!
Well done Katie
I think chantelle was a little hard done by. That was 100 per cent knockdown katie was holding the whole fight. But great performence from katie. Brilliant fight
They keep allowing Katie to clinch constantly
❤ así se boxea ,. Felicidades desde México ❤❤
Katie Katie Katie 🎉❤😂!
Taylor, Amanda the Puerto Rican wainting for you 3 minutes for round, when, What is she waiting for she is old
Score cards all over the place. Only bad thing about this fight is I didn't get to see the whole thing.
She really got hurt, fought and won with the help of the last round. Both fighters should spend a really long time to recover.
2 of the best fights ive ever seen man or woman. Fatastic fights. No losers for me
How can u have a draw then a 98/92 scorecard 😂
Taylor was dropped out muscled and not once warned about coming in with her head and not to mention how many times she was holding,  that was a case of bias ref and the luck of the Irish
Refere vendido
Well deserved but these commentators are so biased it’s insane. Shouldn’t be allowed at all
Commentary team can’t hide their bias
Get in katie, that gobsh1te had a huge chip on her shoulder in the build up.
what a battle ...wow!!!
Great fight closer then one of the judges had it tho
Katie Taylor is such a grimy fighter, and it's crazy that the ref didn't take points for the amount of holding.  This was honestly really embarrassing embarrassing for women's boxing.
Both of their heads hurt, they have massive headaches and most likely permanent brain damage. Is it all worth it though? 🤔 🤔
One judge even and another 92 98 are both disgracefull. Both should not be judging boxing
How can one judge have it even and the 2nd judge so far apart??
Ain’t no way Katie Taylor won this , HOW!????, even the person all the way at the back can see she was holding for her life all the way through, i giver her the first and MAYBE SECOND ROUNDS but the rest NEVER& and that jab Knockdown on Katie was STIFF & accurate . Chantelle Won AND THAT’S A FACT.
FOTY🙏🏿
And there were those who thought she was done!, "NOT JUST YET! She's got a re-mach to win....and win she will!!!.
I would have had it a draw, but I guess everybody wanted Taylor to win..
Katie showed that you can’t be taught CLASS ❤
Taylor lost that fight.
Nah no ways fu.. Cameron won here
The ref needs glasses, that was a fair knock down.
That was a complete knockdown, no to waste about that, why are referees cheating fighters like that, and no one picks this issue up . NOT FAIR😢😢
Where are the haters?!
I wish they didnt look so similar 😂
Great fight.
Clear KD called a none KD LOL and the amount of holding Taylor did towards the end! 🤦🏻‍♂️ but saying that it was a Great fight though and I’d love to see the trilogy! Respect to both fighters and congratulations to KT 🥊🥊
Chantelle never owned the belt...Katie was just letting her mind it for a while 🤣🤣
Well done Katie amazing ❤
Katie will be knocked out soon. She has to retire soon. Lots of loops in her game.
The trilogy needs to happen
You wouldn't want to forget to put the bins out if you lived with her 😮
Legit KD in first Rd, 98-92😂 never seen a boxer get as many close/dodgy calls as Taylor.
Some amount of rabbit punches off that traveller
Wow what a fight. Thank you to both women hats off to both
😢😢Taylor lost it!  fraud!
well done katie but the holding was a joke. every other punch. yet commentators talking about fight of the year😂😂😂😂 these guys man... give me richie woodhall or paulie malignagi any day of the week
Katie gives me tears of pride every time 🇮🇪🥊🥊
Pfff trilogie !!!
Love the toe to toe style the women have 🎉
Amazing achievement but can’t see how she won any of the first 6/7 rounds lol
Setelah nonton video full nya penilaian sy kety Taylor menang tipis  dgn nilai 97 banding 95 .
Head butting and holding the whole fight and the knock down bias Irish ref don’t say nothing score cards as well corruption protect Eddie’s cash cow. Chantelle must be devastated losing her belts. I say it how it is. Money talks boxing 🥊
We love you katie
2 elite fighters
Eddie had to let her win hes loosing to much money atm
Majority decision?
The greatest 🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪
The hole wilder wilder trilogy. Didn't fill that many seats 😂 💯
Great result by Taylor but I think a third fight will go against her. This was a war and that coupled with her age might just see things catch up with her. It's happened to the best of fighters. These two has shown the advancement of women's boxing unlike fights of yesteryear.
What an absolute war. Katie is an absolute Legend 🙌🇮🇪
taylor mükemmel boks yaptı cameron ise kavga  bu yüzden kondisyonu biten tayloru yenemedi
What an amazing fight! Better then most heavyweight fights lately!
I believe it was a draw if anything
Women’s boxing looks like more exciting than men’s boxing
Very exciting fight 👏👏👏👏👏. One of the most exciting
That round 1 is big-time robbery 😑😑😑
OUR HEROINE. After a tough week in Dublin, Ireland, for the Irish people, Katie pulled off an absolute heroic feat. Proud is an understatement.
Taylor was clinching for life and she WAS KNOCKED DOWN! Cameron won this fight.
So who paid off the judge that scored it so wide to Taylor? Tited of matchrooms fight fixing
I have not smiled in a long time when it comes to Boxing . Thank you Katie for putting a smile on my face 🥲 you are a true champion ❤
*Katie Taylor is a Living Legend!* *Incredible performance, she can retire on top knowing she achieved it all!*
Katie Taylor Vs mikayla Mayer would be bonkers
Taylor spent more time golding then fighting
Congratulations Katie ! A great performance and a great victory✊️
Tarzan in the ring amazing
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Sham.Taylor has no power,just a headless chicken throwing flurries of swinging hit and hope shots and clinching.Also sounds like she’s been punched in the throat one too many times,has damaged her Clacker.
How can you have 98-92, 95-95 and 96-94  What an earth is going on…..
That was a knockdown imo they need a III FIGHT
Katie Taylor: you proved all the doubters wrong. You’ve shown the world what the power of belief and faith can accomplish and proved to everyone that you are the GWOAT! 👏👏👏
Fantastic fight, a credit to both. I wouldn’t have had an issue with a decision either way but 98/92 was diabolical. 8 round to 2?!!
Agree with 98/92.? Forget that what about 95/95..? What a joke.
Very very close , one judge was well away on the cards , another terrible opinion as a professional judge getting paid for that ! Shame on you ! But Taylor deserved that on the other cards!
Katie Teylor, Esta mujer es Impresionante de otro universo..... Cameron tremenda guerrera tremendo combate ambas Grandes ......
Katie’s a machine….Taylor abú👏🏻
People keep raving about womens boxing but all I see are glorified slug fests tbh 🤨
It seems the winner was decided by vote of the audiences. Katie is too popular to be defeated.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Absolute legend. Such a lovely girl as well. Humble and so much warmth coming from her. Well done Katie 💪🏼
Home cooking. The first knock down was legit. Biased referee, biased commentaors, biased judges, biased spectators  ... a disgrace. Chantelle needed a knock down or a near perfect fight to retain her belts.
give amanda serrano her well deserve rematch ....btw serrano win the first fight
The Dazn commentator had a Katie Taylor tshirt on 😂 absolutely embarrassing.
This is better than watching today's heavyweight division lol.
Don't get the 98-92 score glad Katie won but it was a definite knock down in the 1st
100% a knockdown
Katie was doing a lot of holding
Buena  😋 pelea 🥊😎🙏👍👋
Katie as always pure class. She deserved the win. So proud of her. She is the best female boxer and a true legend. The better fighter won. Simple as!!
Taylor holds too much
Terrific fight. Katie made great changes which really showed up in the first half dozen rounds. Head movement, never being on the ropes. The uppercuts from Chantelle and her stamina got her back into it, but Katie closed strong. I can't wait for the rubber match. What a year for boxing.
So many people counted Katie out and acted like it was a forgone conclusion that she’d lose. Glad she proved them wrong.
Get up Katie!! Katie and Shields are female boxing legends. Serrano too. Respect
Not a knock down in rd 1. Feet tangled. Look again.
LET'S GO BRAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!
I AM 46 YEARS OLD AND A MASSIVE FIGHT FAN I GREW UP WATCHING THE GREATS IN MY OPINION, BERRERA V MORRALES   MICKY WARD V ATURO GATTI  BIG DADDY BOWE V HOLYFIELD  BUT SWEET JESUS THAT FIGHT TONIGHT WILL STAND UP WITH THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN HATS OFF WOW
Big Spanish crowd!
That was a knockdown and the clinching was crazy.
Well done Katy, what an absolute legend and inspiration.
Now let’s get the rubber match for 12, 3 minute rounds!
One judge had it a draw 😂 must of been watching the old fight 😂
Taylor's a mix breed of Warrington and Okolie.
Katie hit n hold Taylor. Should have had 1 point deduction at the very least
Honestly Katie lost that fight 4 to 6 rounds
The commentary is so biased. You’ve to watch these fights with the sound off. The legit knockdown was mad. And 98-92 wild! Well done to Taylor.
I have to say the reff did   a horrible job and Let Cameron hit Katy in the back of the head every round and never Said a word every time he had to break them  up  Camera was hit katy in the back of the head and nobody said anything
Hugging all the time 😂
Katie banyak ngetangkul cancham,pererakan lengan chancam d kunci trus,tp bisa menang poin,🤔🤔
amazing fighter, what a come back
Katie brings it back to Ireland 🇮🇪 !!!!!!!
As a Highligh,How Taylor win?
Amazing fight 👍
Well desreved win 🇮🇪👊🏽🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅
Excellent fight a right war look forward to the trilogy yeah boi.
Brilliant fight, probably best female fight I’ve ever seen. No way did Katy Taylor win 98-92 on 1 of judges scorecards though, much closer than that but Katy Taylor the deserved victory and there has to be a 3rd contest now in a neutral venue to decide who is better overall.  That was outstanding entertainment and commitment from both fighters 👏🏻
Katie was brilliant at getting out of range of Chantelle’s Jab, massive respect for both fighters.  Let’s get number 3 booked!
Katie fought better this time. Trilogy to determine the outcome of these two for sure
taylor was lucky in that 9th round, her legs had gone and she was being held up
Lotta head butts…
Cracking Fight, well done Ladies your a credit to Boxing, Trilogy has to happen
37 years old and going up a weight and fighting like that can't be understated, amazing fighter! Amazing fight! Well done to both fighters.
way more entertaining and exciting than any clarissa shields fight.
💪☘️💚💪
🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪  Go on home
Nah, this is nonsense. Taylor got battered.  And that's only in the highlights!!!
Well done, Katie!!! ❤
Why did Cameron have her hand up the clown.
Best fight since ali v frazier 3 , unbelievable,  hard to pick a winner for the non boxing community,  bet more uk people glad taylor won , won a few quid on it , lol,  dont like to see girls bleeding like this but that is real boxing , no fix just to get 3 rd fight but bring it on at croke pk where each girl can retire loaded and well deserved
Corrupt judges , it is boxing business for investors ,because of they invest more money toward to Katie so , they will make her win . It is the bottom .😂line .
3.
👎👎👎👎
Trilogy or Serrano again?
Chantelle won that fight, it could have been a draw also
This commentary was very biased towards Katie Taylor. This commentary favoured Katie Taylor.
Rematch needs to happen that was exciting, shame about the biased commentary they both fought well but katie would get praised whilst getting punched in the face quality fight.
They stay pulling bs in europe
These girls put most of the men to shame these days.
Up the rish easy fight
Not sure about that it seemed pretty even to me
At that age and she still on top respect
That was a knockdown
Wow they both put on a show, I said thus isn't women's boxing this is boxing at a high level. Love from Brooklyn NY
I like Taylor but hearing the commentators and the crowd I knew right away she would be gifted the W if the fight was close. Put the fight on mute and watch it. If your Taylor fan you’ve already convinced yourself she deserved to win. As a non bias fan watch the fight on mute, I had Cameron winning.
Otro robo
I have never heard such biased commentary. Even from these "highlights" there is no way that Taylor ran away with the fight like the commentary and two of the judges claim - absolutely ridiculous.  Don't forget that three minute, twelve rounds, was also done a couple of weeks ago...
Katie Flailer flailed to win that. British boxing is circus nowadays
How the Ref miss that knock down 🤦🏾‍♂️
wow
Ref needs to be fired. That was a knockdown in the first. What an idiot lol
Katie should change her team
Ganó Katy Taylor. Por caer a la lona y agarrarse espero que pelees con Amanda Serrano a ver si de verdad  eres la mejor claro sin pagarle a los juese
Cameron won to me
Cameron stood on Katie's foot which caused the knock down
Tight fight....Taylor edges it. Not sure why people are disputing that it was a knockdown when it clearly wasn't. She was caught off balance and was unhurt.
Cameron lands a shot on Taylor's face  Commentary team:   Taylor lands a shot on Cameron's face  Commentary team: "That's brilliant work from Katie."
Cameron robbed - taylor was badly beaten up and relied on holding to survive. More corruption is sport this week
Cameron won this fight!
She should fight Cameron in England. She would get smashed.
🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Well done Katie!! Eddie, she was our superstar long before you, don't ever thank us , ur needed, not wanted
All boxing matches should be 2 minute rounds makes it way better
Katie 🇮🇪 ❤️
this was alot more better and entertaining compared to that snoozefest shakira twitterson vs edwin de los santos bout😂😮
I thought Taylor edge the fight out
Super fight
The holding taylor did was ridiculous
That was a knock down 😢
That commentating was annoyingly bias.
Well done KT
This woman held all fight
ROBBERY
That was a knockdown.
Congratulations Katie Taylor.
Those scorecards are an absolute joke 😂😂
I must have the irish blinkers on. For me, katie won that handy 🤷🏻‍♂️🟢⚪️🟠
Que peleón estas son si son peleas grandes peleadorazas WoW me pongo de pie y me quito el sombrero estás si son peleas no las estupideces de shakur vs de los santos
Come on man lst rd was knock down  from stiff jab caught  her square on😄
I had Cameron on points
That knockdown is the clearest knockdown I have seen in my life 😂
So many sore losers on here, just take it on the chin, pardon the pun 😂. Well done our Katie, So proud of you 💕🍀.
My farts are more exciting than this
Stood on her toes for the knockdown
Well done to both fighter's I thought Katie fought like she's in trench war fear both did to be fear speed was key first in best dressed.
Dazn so corrupt and biased. Don't show the blatant headbutt that causes the cut. So bad. Just like the ref and commentary
💤💤💤💤
Katie hugged all night just like Ricky Hatton
Should of been a knockdown
That was a knockdown
If you watched the fight on mute, Chantelle won
DAZN production team did a poor job on this fight. They never gave us a slow motion replay of the non-knockdown, which was a crucial call.
Epic display from both   Grit n determination  Hats off to the both of them   Congratulations Katie Taylor 👏 ❤
Far better than shakur fights
Taylor should of lost that fight. Kept hugging in the last rounds.
8:15 we are witnessing greatness as Taylor gets ragdolled 😅
Well done Katie 💚💚💚😊
Katie lost again  sad too see this
Unbelievable performance from Katie. She can feel a bit hard done by with that score line.
A competitive bout partly ruined by dreadful commentators!
The Paddies would be throwing their pints of Guinness if Taylor was denied a legit knockdown.
Wo brilliant boxers🎉🎉🎉
Katie...you are an inspiration. Im an old man,but lady,you had me alive again tonight. Well done sweet lady.
The Referee was H O R R I B L E
So fixed disgusting to have a clear knock down ruled out that’s so wrong. Looks like Eddie been spending again him and frank warren pair of fight fixers
Katie still won for sure but the 98-92 guy def got bribed 😂.
Fair play to Katie in terms of the career she’s forged and life she’s lived. But she’s really not amazing nor is Cameron, hopefully though with the light this brings to women’s boxing the next crop can really push on. This level of fight was poor. You look at the likes of Crawford to this. I think the same waiting guy as a journeymen would dust these women
Class girl fair play
Katie still fights like an amateur in the Olympics..... plus that knockdown was legit... sad that they had to rob Chantelle like that... another gift decision for the hometown girl... smh
The crying from saltiness is unreal! Mainly from jake Paul fans.
Taylor light robbery.
Taylor won by the number of punches landed
To beat Taylor you have to do what Marquez did to Pacquiao, knock her out cold because if it goes the distance the judges will give her the win.
we have seen it  B4 we will see it again Home town decision And i'm Irish
Usual brown envelope job, i had it a draw but Chantelle had a nockdown which even a blind man could see. so she should of nipped it but hey,  matchroom show, matchroom fighter, Ireland what did we expect?  usual boxing shadiness..
Robbery! And that was a knock down in the first.
Rigged as always.
Definitely a knockdown but the powers at be were taking no chances tonight, get the Ref, 2 Judges and the commentary team on your side and you can't lose.
What a fight it was the best fight both girls gave there all it will go down in history as one if not greatest women's boxing match and as a proud iresh women Katie Taylor won this fair and square 🎉🎉🎉❤ Olay Olay Olay Olay 🎉🎉trileagy on the way 😊
Serrano would obliterate her in a rematch
These two need to go again
Cameron won that fight respectfully 👏🏼
Wow just wow
Amanda Serrano would beat both of them.Katty did a lot of holding and the ref didn't call it.
Wow
I’m sorry but as close as this was the referee to the commentators is really poor, the other way around that 1st round knock down counts. The commentary is so one sided. Really sad to see
Congratulations Katie, you are the most successful female boxer and you will be remembered as one of the best in history.
Corruption again in boxing, referees like this should be banned from boxing. He favoured Katie all the way.
98-92??? Is this judge been real, or did he watch a different fight?😅
Banger of a fight.
Well done to both ❤ saving boxing x
This needs a trilogy to set the score
KT is our national pride and our greatest ever athlete. 🇮🇪
Cameron is filth - behind the head, after the bell - well done Katie
Different result if the knockdown was scored as it should have been.
It was a close fight. If you remove the influence of the partisan crowd and include the knockdown as legitimate, you can argue Cameron edged it.
How’s that not a knockdown ???
One word and call me out distance 🎉🎉🎉🎉 well done katy fair play.    Ps 1st round was deffo a knock down.
Will her body at the age of 37 be able....? Do you hear yer man? Most boxers are in their sweet spot in their late 30s
Dear DAZN Basically all you need to do is have one camera shot where we can see the whole body. Having the camera move with the fighter loses perspective. Doing quick edits while the fighters are in motion loses perspective Having close ups loses perspective Having a camera moving above their heads loses perspective. etc etc etc Go back and watch old footage. What we want as much as possible is a stable shot as that allows us to see the movement from the watchers perspective. How can you not understand this?
Amazing fight, the heart and bravery shown by both women should be applauded. Croke Park has to happen, Katie won't retire until it does. Let's not make her fight into her forties, give her the venue and swansong she deserves and has more than earned at this stage.
I had KT taking all 4 of the opening rds, also never a KD in the 1st, Cameron steps on KTs foot as the punch lands and thats why KT couldnt catch her footing. Cameron rallied really well in the 5th but KT answered in the 6th, 789 were all Cameron rds and i thought she was on course for a draw. Possibly even drop KT and rally for a win, but KT showed the heart and the spirit tbat makes her an all time great in that 10th, momentum against her, dog tired and starting to feel the power of Cameron, but she dug in and won Possibly the most important rd of he career. Shes an absolute legend and the pride of Ireland no doubt.
these 2 put on better fights than Tommy fury
We lovvv katie.a legend irish and honest.tnx kt.
Katie never won that
Fk did Katie win , more like she was gifted that fight because it was in her back yard.
What a set up by  Eddie the fixer Hearn
Chantelle clearly won the fight, Great for Re matchroom boxing
Unprofessional when you see 2 fighters exchanging punches but commentators mention only the fighters they promote 😢
I thought the other girl won, i dont understand what everyone else was watching, she should of had a knock-down, she landed the better punches she was pushing the fight, Taylor was constantly clinching and only real damage was from headbutts, but whatever 98-92 aha yh sure😂
98-92 smh
Katie is a legend. It's a pleasure to watch her box. Greetings from Spain Irish brothers 🇪🇸🤝🇮🇪.  Props to both fighters.
The clinching is ridiculous
Katie was spent after 8
KATIE TAYLOR the best 👌  great fight! 👊
That knockdown that wasnt counted should have been the difference maker........
Cameron can fight alot better and she will be kicking herself, as for Taylors was one of her best fights. Be nice to see a rematch in England and not in Taylors home country again , but as we know Taylor wont fight cameron outside of ireland.
Cameron was so basic, by the 7th and 8th round she resorted to wrestling. Katie fought brilliantly and edged the fight. All the sweeter as I was there witness a great performance from the greatest Irish boxer ever. 4-0 against the Brits 😂😂 dont be salty lads.
Go Katie! What a fight!
No way katie won that
Credit to both fighters.. women boxing has come a long long way. This was one of the best fights I've ever seen. Taylor is the goat. Camerons time is coming
katie is the biggest trash in female boxing trash
Katie Taylor the biggest trash ever. Winning by Paying the Ref and Judges Again 1st agains serrano then this time trash
Forget gender, great fighters , great fight. Brilliant watch.
Jab knock down, and rest of fight cameron won again, 7-3 Taylor gets a gift decision again in her backyard
Cameron dropped her and pressed her the whole fight.
Trilogy?
From the highlights,Taylor was hugging the majority of the time,from  what I've seen.
Katie clearly won it
More exciting than Tyson vs Holyfield‼️😜💯
Taylor is prettier but  I like Cameron style better.
96-93 Taylor for me, Close fight but taylor edged it even if you count the knock down.
Robbery👎This is why MMA will always triumph lol
I am no expert,  But Katie lost that fight , She kept holding on half the fight exhausted , Plus the crowd would have gone ballistic ! Would there be a third on the cards maybe, More money !
If you score the robbed knockdown in round 1 the fights a draw. Hope they both make some bank in the 3rd fight.
A very close fight could have gone either way imo should have been given to undefeated defending champion who was strong and landed bigger punches even though I like great Katie
Sorry, I thought Cameron won that. Taylor's shots had nothing behind them, headbutts caused the cuts.
🐐
To the people saying robbery, what fight were you guys watching. Katie clearly won that fight
Trilogy
Strong performance from Taylor it is well deserved 👏🏿, but I don't agree with one of the judges scores of 98-92 😂
That's why she is the Goat 🐐
95-95 was BS!!
So proud ♥️🇮🇪
I found the face off abit creepy
Greatest off all
How did Katie Taylor win this fight? Even from the carefully selected clips here, Cameron had the better moments.
Looks like Taylor just wanted to cuddle more than anything 🤷‍♂️
Robbery Chantal is the true champion not Katie headbutter Taylor
Katie is the biggest inspiration to any women or man, this women’s life is truly remarkable.
what a difference in fight compared to Skye Nicolson and her amateur style  point scoring
K Taylor uses her head as  weapon
What a figh unreal one very tough woman Well done Katie . 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 You had that all the way . A true fighter .
Katie Taylor - You are a true superstar - A real World Champion - Doing Ireland proud.
Amanda whooped katie. This fight draw at best cuz cameron had a knockdown.Cameron had the biggest punches. Alot of taylors shots did t land and the ones that did didnt phase cameron
Robbery!!
They said the crowd affects the judges.. if that's true it should be changed
Cameron looking at her corner and ref everytime Katie hanged on to her.  Cameron is pathetic and not a champ.  A champ can adapt, change and fight.  It was frustrating to watch, as she could have at least tried.  She threw her chance away.  Silly woman.
Same as the Serrano fight... Taylor lost but...since it was in Taylor's house she got the decision
GOAT
98 - 92 and an even? Who scores these fights??
Hometown decision
96-94 Taylor.
They need to change women's boxing to 3 minute rounds. If they are concerned about safety make it 8 3 minute rounds
Boxing is BS most corrupt sport on the planet
better fight than shakur hahaha
Well done katie 🇮🇪
Katie won but there was too much hugging from her. I don’t blame her tbh, age is getting to her.   However, those headbutts weren’t great.  Great win though and fair play to her for coming back and winning undisputed champion at super lightweight division.  She did this at 37 years of age!  I would say leave it at high and retire!   Honestly, what more is there to prove?
women’s boxing is actually a lot of fun with these two
Clear win for Katie. Hats off to her!
Katie clearly won but idk ab 98-92
Chantelle robbed
