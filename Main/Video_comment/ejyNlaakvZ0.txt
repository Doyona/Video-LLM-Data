23:43 Jokingly says "I'll put my face just over the fueled fire" ... then proceeds to do exactly that :D
My dad had one when I was a kid. It was a5 speed. The thing would run 70 down the interstate no problem. It even got like 14mpg
didnt know opossums where cool like that
did you sell this?
too bad I'm poor I'd sure like to have that.. I need a home
"I've never smelt BTU before" followed up by "We might die tonight" and taking the smoke detector off the ceiling in one swift motion still gets me. Like how can you have such a perfect sequence of events unscripted.
That’s great!
Take it from an old guy with glasses. Take a picture of your book. Then blow it up on your phone.
I fuckin love it when Ezra shows up.
This engine sound like lawnmower  engine
puddinsfabshop would love this
The best thing about fixing cars is when something fixes itself and you have no idea how or why and last forever, it shows that magic is real and angus is a genie
I’ve watch this episode. The three wheeler video. And couple others ezeri videos you two are great together
That possum looks very pleaced ! :) @28.20
Nicest Motorhome I've seen so far on your channel.
wasn't even suprised thats a yota right there
31:19 this made me laught out my bed! 😂😂😂😂🤣
Make mor kamper videos  Kevin it is fun and enjoyable learning alot
I want to buy that camper if you're interested
I had a 1992 Toyota 4x4 truck several years ago. 22R-E 4 popper with an automatic transmission, manual locking hubs. Never missed a tick and never burned oil. Reliable as the sun.
Always wanted one of those or a similar Datsun/Nissan version.
first time i smell btu's 🤣LOL!
There are two common 'smiley face looking' Japanese characters. Neither have any explicit meaning since they were created to represent sounds in a foreign language. The first is ツ - Tsu ('tsoo) and it just looks like a smiley face. The other is シ - Shi (she) and it looks like someone about to say "shit would you look at that!"
Just curious cause I'm looking for one,do you still have it and if so how much?
I like how he just picked up a random possum and was cuddling it
This is like if my camry had a camper strapped to the back of it. Its underpowered as is and i cant even imagine how slow that would be
22RE is a legend
@31:17 🤣 that's the reason y I'm HERE!
Merry Christmas where is the uncle Eddie robe and cigar 😂
OMG!  the Possum!  ahah,   Bro you-re a savage!  ahah funny!
I remember as a kid in new england every once in a while seeing a dually toyota with a homemade flatbed and i always thought they were so cool , I always like fords and rams but the toyota was so rare and different looking they were cool ! My buddy got his hands on one when we were older and put a 4bt in it thing was awesome
I’d love to find me one of the old Toyota RVs
I bet Kevin’s first pet was a Possum instead of a dog because he loves possums so much
I need to buy one of these and rebuild it 😁. Looks like my kind of "pain"
Top tip , put the Lucas in the microwave for 3 mins to thin it down before pouring , for best results make sure the cooks not in the kitchen at the time
Older Toyotas also dont prime the fuel pump when you turn the key on, they only do it when cranking.
I will be looking for this same camper I. A few months
I would drive it every day
My family had one of these and every summer wed pack in and drive it 14 hours through the mountains of British Columbia to our camping spot. its about a 6 hours drive in a regular car, the thing would barely hit 100kph on flat. Fuckin mountains.
1st day into 2025 and this video is great😂😂
Do more toyotas plzz
A friend's Dad purched a used RV, think I recall it to be a Chevy or GMC chassis. The thing had all kinds of simple issues that needed to be addressed but ran well. He went over it, fixed all the tics and he and his better half drove it from SE Looziana out to California down the coast and back. Then he sold it for a profit. The guy was Mr. Wizard when it came to making schit work.
When will Kevin stop being surprised that old Japanese cars are unkillable?
GREG TWOOOOOOO
Ezra is a comedic genius. His quips and timing are always perfect.
32:03 when he slams the hood the bumper just heals itself, ive witnessed the toyota miracle of healing.
OMG thank you for saying water heater and not “hot” water heater
I would absolutely love a little camper like that, especially since its a toyota.
Didn’t know opossums were docile
There was a possum that was raised by our cats pretty cool
Damm the perfect size for me how cute free right
Foreshadowing for the Possum Van episode at 25:45
Only thing your missing is Dawton and Angus there to make it a 4 man camping trip😂
Shit them little Toyota pickups/Campers are good for at least 68mph 72 if your going downHill 😂😂
What type of camper is this ? I wonder if i can buy one.
I got one of those campers
it seems like the noise is a convination of the valve regulators being shot, the exaust leaking at the manifold and the engine that got a broken oil seal on the cilinder (thats why it clears after reving it) but yeah this is going to be hell for driving with all that camper on the back must be ultra low on torque
15:00 the idle screw is above your hand there just need a flat head screwdriver...and those 22re idle down after they warm up so after 3 or five minutes or more depending how cold it is
Junkyard digs relizing why people love the 22r and 22re... can find them sitting for years and some starting fliud and battery will fire up and run... i have a 1994 pickup 22re with 291k miles
I love  what  you  are  doing  mat
Looks good
Ngl that engine sounds like a weedwacker
Humberto Mission
Valentine Burgs
i love the old hooptie camper revivals/campouts lmao
Aditya Lights
Omg o literally just said that Ted Green quote to my boss.. 'Uf woman don't find u handsome at least they can find u handy' 😂😅😮😊
Altenwerth Estates
These Toyota campers are popular. This will sell easily.
Is the Toyota motorhome  for sale ?
Opossums are wild. I was surprised to see a opossum on my porch one time trying to take a deer leg I had put in the trash from that deer season. I let it be but it never could figure out how to get it off my porch to eat in peace somewhere else.
"why does this drive so much better than the chevys?"  cuz toyota
So he got around liking possums from the fiat episode way back.
when you stepped on it at the beginning to get going it sounded like a lawn mower
I can not believe its just a 4 cylinder it cant have any power at all with all that weight
😊😊❤😊❤😊😊❤😊😊❤
teach this man to shave safely
Expect nothing less from a Toyota
hahaahh  fire Beavis and Butt-Head FX LOL
Kevin you said that part about Eagle scout wrong, you say it I am an Eagle scout, because once an Eagle's scout always an Eagle scout. This comes from an Eagle scout of 40 years
Nascar is waiting
You should try to find a vehicle to fix
That’s so frickin clean!!
9:11 Have the motor running just like a song!
"Don't shoot opossums. They're clearly awesome. " -Kevin
One of these made it's way to a camper lot in England. We were looking for a vehicle to use for our honeymoon, and we had a look at it, but turned it down as it was a bit over budget. I really wish we'd pushed and bought it.
I just discovered this channel last night and it's very interesting
Would it be better or worth it putting a bigger/stronger engine in it?
@12:35 take a picture with your phone and just zoom in...
Bro is cuddling a WILD Opossum. Twisted tea is some good shit. I want to camp with these guys.
Hit in the head by a Bible Only on your channel lol
You guys need to get yourself a "power probe", its way better than a basic test light you cqn send power to things with it or ground them or both to test parts and find bad wires and connections ❤❤❤
yo quiero una de esas¡¡
Cars you old
Take the Camper kansas speedway
Is it still available?
The end of may is a hell of a time to find out christmas is in a month im going to have to clean my house up for santa
This wasn’t really a “revival” . It was more just starting a toyota
This wasn’t really a “revival” . It was more just starting a toyota
Nice! I picked up an 87 toyota RV with 70k miles for $300 thats been sitting for a few years, Dropped the fuel tank and installed a new pump, engine wise a simple tune up and it runs like a champ. Passed smog here in CA with flying colors. RV body though I rebuilt the roof and fully redid all the wiring and electronics, solar and lithium battery, and full renovation. After a couple thousand in have a great mini motorhome. These mini toyota RV's are a gem!
Heck yeah, 80s Toyota Pickup Camper
They're great.... until you have to go up a hill lol.
maaan I want that thing so bad, its like the perfect little camper. Keep up the good work
29:20 Just....Kevin cuddling with a possum is peak vibes. I love it lmao.
That possum stuff was some Florida man crazy … you and pole barn garage need to come to Florida
Kevin turned off the water heater while Ezra was showering.
First 10 minutes didn't see these guys checked the oil or water...not even the fuel level....probably drives 100 miles with oil or water
This thing is really cool. The fact that it goes faster than 40 is really impressive.
Kevin should have taken that camper to NASCAR. Or maybe a couple of campers.
iv heard the lucas stop slip will disolve away all the rubber seals in the transmission over time.  Wonder if thats true ?
It's a toyota ?!  no wonder it has 100 thousand miles on it. Toyota's are some of the longest lasting vehicles out there, That thing could be an amazing camper when fully restored.
I have no idea how this turned out, i just started watching the video, but that is one pretty rare, cool camper with the more car like front end.. DRUEL.. that thing could be really nice.
This thing is awesome, everything I would need in a camper.
Me: Doesn’t like possums Kevin: “This guy’s name is Greg” 😂 So cute though
Best episode ever!!!
Loved the episode!! Is the camper still for sale?  I’m interested
I’m interested in buying if it’s for sell and runs
Dude... That is an ideal little model I would love having. Not that the bills that go with it would be wanted, ya know?   And if you thought the heater going on and off was bad... I may have ya beat. I had the "joy" of sleeping on the fold down dining area in a 27 footer... The heater was under one bench and the water heater under the other. Toasty spot, but the oxygen concentrator my dad had was worse noise...
I really want one so I can go across country and visit my family comfortably. Like I really don't like airplane economy flights anymore. I want a nice space to wind down in, and shit in.
0:01  mary Christmas the shitter is full
My names Ezra. I have a 87 Toyota pickup. Kinda crazy to hear your name I don’t hear it often. Awesome video
Red Green Reference! lol
From.july 2015 to 2 2022 i lived in my 1987 toyota 🐬 dolphin n saved money big time n slept comfortable here in northern calif 🇺🇲
You got it toyota 🇺🇲
29:04 possum content
Clock from the Titanic? Way too soon. It still feels like yesterday that the news announced it sunk.
What are u pou going to do with the camper is it for sale good luck
Don't know why but the camper vids are my favorite
I'm so sad that I don't own this thing.
We love Toyota's!!! 🙂
For a vehicle that's been sitting in the woods for a year or so, it's a GREAT weed killer (don't see any tall weeds around the vehicle)/tires that holds air for life a great CONTENT VID for the unexpected...good to get commercials watched by few people or so
I'd rather see Ezra over Angus, Angus drives me nuts. He's not funny and just irritating.
This is all staged. 😂 come on guys. This is totally staged😂 everything so clean for sitting awhile in the middle of the woods
"Do you know Japanese because i dont know English" 😂😂😂
I ❤ your videos!!   Thanks for doing these revival posts. 👍
Reviving a Toyota is usually simple.
Would you happen to still have this thing??
I almost bought one of these.  In fact It was nearly identical.  However, I asked to look inside and the guy was hesitant.  but reluctantly opened it up.   there was no refrigerator, thus just an open hole with that grate to the outside,  The table bench seats were gone, replaced by some salvaged city-bus seats. And when I opened the cabinets is where it got really "good".   Along the ceiling where the back of the cabinet meets the ceiling, I could see daylight coming in and the wood was wet and delaminating. It was like this in two of the overhead cabinets.  Open gaps that drained water directly into the cabinets.   Hard pass.  Maybe for 2 or 3 hundred,  then I would fix it up.  But the seller (a little local used car lot)  wanted 10,000 for it!   No friggin way.   I eventually bought a 1986, 27ft Coachmen Classic on a Ford E350 chassis (with a 460) for 5,000 bucks.   Everything works, (except the aftermarket dash AC)  Plus it has a separate shower room and toilet room and a private Master bedroom in the rear. In addition to the table-bench and a HUGE over-cab bed that's like a king-size bed. Needs some TLC but the roof doesn't leak. I did some work to it,  bought a new full atress for the bed in the back,  curtains,  LED bulbs in the interior. (warm white,  not those gray-blue LED's)  It hauls ass,  (uphill doing 74, passing a shitbox with a fart-can.)  Drive like a tanker ship,  but is comfortable and smooth. Still has a voltage regulator hiccups so the chassis lights flicker a bit.  But overall,  It's my first RV, and I'm satisfied.   If you want a change of routine, Get an RV.  Make it reliable, Go somewhere.  It's awesome!
Why does this run and drive so well?  It's a Toyota.
@ 29:06 I thought that " Instead " of " The " Awesome 'O' Possum " There would be a Bear Breaking in Or Even a " Wolf "  at the door, and Berk would say " Oh "... " Dude " !
wwow
"AHHHH! IT'S THE BIBLE!"
*AWESOME POSSUM* OFFICALLY TRADEMARKED DOMESTICALLY & INTERNATIONALLY.. 🧾
AWESOME POSSUM SHOULD BE UOR OFFICIAL MASCOT.. LUV THE P.S.A. ON POSSUM.. WE CITY FOLK NEED SOME RURAL KNOWLEDGE.. KEEP THE VIDZ ROLLING.. 🧠
If its a toyota, it aint dying
wow that's a shook camper i haven't  seen one in years
Nice girly bun
Deep in the woods of Kevin and Michas Back yard.
27:30-27:36 appreciate the Red Green Show reference 🫡
now i want one
I feel like Kevin should do some Toyota revivals
For some reason a lot of people think that those little Toyota caint pull anything but yet there a camper there pretty strong
Me and my kid would love to own one of these!
I'm jelly, thats a fun 2/3 person camper with good gas millage and super easy to fix! SCORE!
My uncle had the 4x4 Sunrader. He drove that thing everywhere, and I mean everywhere. From NY to California to Alaska. Those engines were absolutely indestructible.
dont forget to check the tire presure
This was a fun one.
that possum was thinking, I wish i had Rabies right now!
This is the first video I have seen on your channel . Pretty awesome adventure !
Not gonna lie yous are pretty funny to be honest
Great episode! I'm a little bit behind, so this is one of the newer ones for me. So funny thing,  thought while watching the 'used parts blue GMC truck tuning'-video yesterday : I would really like this guy take on a four cylinder, something different! So :  Yay, a Toyota! 😁  Still wondering though, why does Toyotas always surprise people? I mean, I'm more surprised when they don't work!
I want it!
Yep I like the old cars
The truck don't want to crank because it's tired and wants to go to bed
What are you going to do with it? As a disabled woman I would’ve loved this. I wanted to travel after my husband died, but there’s just nothing out there for disabled people unless I spend my fortune I don’t have. 🥴 Loved the possum.
Der Motor klingt genau wie ein Rasenmäher 😮😅😂
You kill a toyota boys
Camper for sale
The opossums here in Texas are ratchet
How much do you want for this unit if you still have it?
That is such a cool camper I’d go 100,000 miles in it
I lived in one of these with 2 other dudes for over a year, I took the top bed, they got the bed at the back. No heat, or ac. Except my buddy did let us run a cord from his house for electricity, and had a spare space heater he let us borrow for winter. We had a little kitchenette and a smaller bathroom, but still had running water and electricity so we were okay.
Not gonna lie, I kinda want one of these *edit* after seeing a total of 1 on marketplace in Iowa for $10k, decided I didn’t like it that much😂
Caviartots!
These campers have a cult following. Like the Chinook and sunraiders. There are c Toyota camper clubs everywhere. This one is in very nice shape and may sell fast for 6k.
That shit is epic...
Hey  Kevin, do you still have  that sun raider from the woods  in one  of your episodes, would like to  purchase  if it's still available  , I would  love  to make  it 4x4. Sincerely  Nate from  Oregon, and follower
I’ve had to fast-forward some of this because I’m late for work, i’m not impressed you got the truck running in. The Kamper works because those old campers are awesome, used to have one what impressed me the most was when I saw the old-school Three Wheeler around the campfire lol. Love those old-school three wheelers, didn’t have them when I was a kid, and have been indulging myself as an adult, have a 85 big red 250 right now
At 29:06 killed me....because Kevin just kidnapped an Opussom from a tree that it was living in 😂.....(I don't think opossums get Rabies....so he was Fine)
Straight up, I would love this camper. I would love to travel the USA in this. Maybe even Canada if they would let me in.
Toy's wont turn on the fuel pump until it sees a signal from the crank sensor.
This is by far the funniest episode I’ve ever watched. Bro y’all need to do this all the time 😂
This might be my favorite episode. I've definitely been on this camping trip
i like your episodes
How cool
engagement
This is one of the best things I've ever watched, Ezra is hilarious and perfectly complements Kevin's chaotic antics. Now I want to go on a camping trip in one of these old campers!
Time for a 2J
I have two friends that each have one of these and live out of them. Super cool trucks, i feel like they are all individually unique.
those 80s yota trucks are badass
28:56 oh my gosh this guy is so funny
any chance this one is for sale?
That opossum looks like she wants less than none of what you have to offer lmao
Always loved those Toyota duallys.
The "oh!" Ezra made when it first almost started made me cackle lmaooo
My father in law had 1 of those Toyota campers I nearly knocked myself out Everytime I got out lol
What? You never heard o blackened tots.
Yeah Toyota's are from Japan, but don't knock em.  Majority of Toyota engines are built like a fucking tank, and you keep up with maintenance, they can go for a long, long, LONG time.
I laughed my ass off seeing you two around that campfire, great video with a great result, nice work.
Is that the possum from the fiat video
“I’d rather it was manual “ I felt that
This thing is so cool I want one!
The Steve Smith Red Green Quotes are spectacular
jesus..
Get the exuast fixed
I swear old Toyotas have problems and somehow fix themselves. It’s happened on mine more times than I can remember
Quando Omni Flunkus Moritati. Okay, sit down.
Awesome 😎 little camping trip truck ❤❤❤❤ can’t kill a Japanese vehicle 🚗 they run forever!!!!!!
Nice to see ya give some love to some Japanese brands! Cool little camper truck to. Awesome video!
toyota so reliable it fixes itself and does not need oil 👍
Who leaves that in the woods
This doesn't seem real
I don't really care for Japanese vehicles in general (let alone campers), but I mean - come on, of course they are going to drive better than a Chevy alternative! You don't buy a Chevy for it to drive well, only to get a V8 sound.
Please Twin Turbocharged this camper.
i hope you lovebirds had a good time!
Those Toyota based campers are so freaking cool. You’d be pleasantly surprised what that little 4 banger can do. Way to go guys👍👍👍
I've been looking to buy one of these interested in selling will pay good for it. ????????
Im guessing its kina flat around there... Where i live we have hils and mountains.  My buddy had a dolphin toyota camper like this one and it lived in 2nd and 3rd gear... and it was a 5 speed
Wish QA1 made suspension components for these old Toyotas
More Angus videos!!!!
I would like it if you could tell how much you got these vehicles for in the videos.
Toyota, they refuse to die and I love em
Not gonna lie, I'd love to get me one of these, restore it while I finish my bachelor's and go on a 1 year tour around the country before I start my masters. BUT I'm 6' 4" so I wouldn't fit in there comfortably.
I want a older little camper like that Soo bad!
27:33 redgreen reference 😂
21:34 bevus and butthead reference 😂
This is like the third "camper" you've done..y'all should be getting good at it. And maybe finding one ya wanna keep & use. Wish I could find one that not completely rotted out. Or completely trashed. I'm 6'4" so this one wouldn't work 🤔
You need to go find a mook and ressurect one.  Havnt seen one revived in ages!
How much did you pay for the camper?? Frank Toledo ohio
I'd buy that thing off your. Pity I live in Australia. Toyota camper, perfect grey nomad wagon.
what model toyotas are used for the chassis of this type of campers?
I have a friend that owns one of these campers.  It's off the road because the transmission is not working.   I'd like to buy it however he claims it cannot be repaired or replaced.  Have a good day, Johnny Boy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Loved the Possum part and that you treated it well, unlike other "people"! Even though it didn't seem to like it a lot! 😅 You are good guys!
Yes it will it's a Toyota just very simple parts.
Dude I've been trying to look for something like that and you guys are lucky to find a camper that looks that good inside and out. I mean come on. I've been looking for something like that on OfferUp and these people that are trying to sell them or ridiculous they're so raggedy inside. There's it's not what it seems like what it says on the description. Man I hope you guys get this running good and sell it cuz that's a gym right there. Good fine great video. Thank you guys for showing what you guys found❤
id love to have something like this even if its auto. id clean it all out rip out the interior and fix the shell cut the top off and make it a few inches taller then get fresh paint. tune up on the motor. give it a 6 or 8 inch lift and 22 or 24 inch offroad tires and just leave the world behind  the dream. i would love a 80s toyota camper
Hi dig very disappointed u got nice finds only engine trouble but outside and camper better condition.... Mine engine good runs and drive outside and inside needs works
I wonder if the camper has some kind of auto shutdown relay that is preventing the fuel pump from engaging properly.
theres 2 types of weird people in this world, weird scary and weird cool Isrha? is definitly the later
Australia and NZ are 2 Western country that just don't have any motorhomes that are pre 2000 except coaster buses im guessing the price of sending a Winabago from the USA to AUS was too much to be worth it or one of our super ridiculous laws, anything fun that has the tiniest danger is banned here and things these guys get for $500 would sell for 10 to 20 times that im serious you would get 20k for this camper in a good running condition
My favorite camper
at 33:33 you fixed the bumper by slamming the hood.
That’s literally a Toyota for ya It just starts after an unknown amount of years sitting and the motor isn’t having a hard time running either
great video made me laugh alot.
Hey man thank you for the video I enjoyed it and I have a serious question for you if you didn't sell this camper yet would you be willing to do a trade because I could surely use it the vehicle that I have I have no use for and I am homeless and I would definitely Shirley used that camper
The sun visor DVD players are still available new but are not cheap.
Ill ride along,  maybe one day Ill be doing the same.    Cheers , safe travels.  Ron from Nova Scotia
That thing sounds like the 80s John deere lawnmower I used to cut grass with
lol, these 4cyl toyota rv is a mistake, that engine works way too hard for that motorhome.
It drives better than Chevy's. Toyota = Chevy Motors Mazda = Ford Motors..
What do you guys do with all these vehicles you guys find and fix up and make them run you guys ever sell them
I love the quirky campers but not so many toy campers hear in the uk think the smallest i have ever seen is a ford escort chairman converted to a camper haha
Thank you for being nice to the local wildlife.....possums eat grubs, and I think them grubs turn into bumble bees....(I just 'googled' bumble bee larvae and that is what grubs look like to me)
Ore gen
It sounds like the motor has a Rod Knock LM A O
The possum reminded me of the fiat video
32:48, Ezra's Gregorian dustpan chant drove me straight to the "like" button.
Hey, if U-Haul ran these as moving trucks, surely it'll haul that camper....  slowly but with Toyota reliability?   Actually this thing is pretty functional and surprisingly clean.  You and Mook could have fun with it.
22RE=Legend
I must try your hot dogs on a long stick, awesome! Well done guys. Always a good laugh!
Glad the heater didn’t monoxide you and glad the possum didn’t take a chunk out of you.
U guys are  alittle crazy to do things like that stuff but i like it fun to watch to two do
This camper that's been sitting in the woods, yet it looks like it's been garage kept.
Cool, little camper. :)
My check engine light gas been on since I got my car in 2018. It's a plug.
You gotta winner.  Sell...
100k miles is nothing for an old (pre-Tachoma) Toyota truck.  You can go 200,000 more miles before you need engine work.
Running crapygas thru carb ?
If it wasn't for the potty mouth I'm sure you'd have more subscribers
Awesome cars great saves too bad you couldn't get through an episode without foul language for that reason I don't watch. Potty mouth
Ezra and the dust pan had me laugh out loud.
I'm a bit envious. My grandparents drove one of those Toyota RVs all over the country, and I'd love one. Certainly easier to get around in than my 34' Winnebago Superchief, and probably in better shape, too.
I think 🤔 it will run 🏃
You should put some mmo in the oil to clean up the varnish in the lifters.
I had possums killing my chickens.
💪👊👏
That looked painfully slow, or is it impression? I really don't know anything about campers, but maintain high rpm for long periods at a highway to keep thr pace does not seem very safe or healthy 😮
my dad used to have one of these and drive 5 hours to work from wv to ohio and he just stayed in it through the work week and came home on the weekends, always thought they was super cool tiny camper
Yeeehaaw!  Fantastic fix and so much fun with you guys. I would love to own that camper ❤.  Wishing you all, the very best for 2024. From Shropshire/North Wales Borders UK xxxxxx🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧
Are you going to sell the camper?
It sounds like a lawnmower
Anyone else see the glowing eyes at 28:05?
timming chain life i about 100k on these early toyota 22r engines. ask me how i know
Never dying Toyota engine..
OMG HAHAHA SO FUNNY!!! Just came across the add for this on marketplace lmao so awesome
Most of those aren't legal to drive with 3 people and all of your needed gear to go camping...
Is rv for sale?
Man I wish I could find these deals on campers / RV's that you seem to be soo good at finding I need to find one to live in because we'll, life lol but the only things I ever find are far far worse condition. I guess it could  be that there's just nothing decent where I'm located. I just know Everytime I see you or Matt from demo ranch come across something like this I'm like damn I could live in that. Anyway love your videos I was raised to be a bit of a shade tree  mechanic myself so I enjoy watching y'all 👍
Kevin now: Possums are awesome. You shouldn’t shoot them.   Kevin a few years ago: “I can shoot you, but I don’t wanna damage the car..” while talking to a possum
awsome video kevin didnt take long to get going lol helps if you add tran fuild you should go camping in that one lol wood love to see that and try out the stove thumbs up and shared
Love this old camper I want to get one like this
7:12 Imagine how good of a segue that would be for a language learning app sponsorship...
I thought those would be top heavy. Nice to know that they aren't.
"It's like tv but live" 😂
I love how cute these campers are
hay is that camper  for sale ?
Aaaah…yeah, is that a face/person on the door 27:54..smiling???…or is it just me having too much of the ‘Don’t Watch This Video Alone’ moments?
U guys are so funny ❤
That 1980s style shore-power DC and Fuse unit is prone to regulation and filtration type failures, double-check voltages.
Could of swore i seen this thing driving south of colo towards collins over the summer.
GOD.    J               CH         .
Totota never die and healing it self lol😅
Watch that possum. He might be playing himself.
You made me want one of those. It would be badass to make it 4wd and lift it a little. A straight axle and transfer case. It would run forever
Love those old Yota campers
You can't go wrong with a 80"s toyota engine! They were the only small engines on the market that had a timing "chain" . All the American cars had timing belts at that time which would break at 60,000 miles and destroy your motor. So it's a keeper!
Don’t act surprised a Toyota runs
Solid axel swap it and put an atlas transfer case in it to make it a BIVOUAC vehicle
Kevin wants a Toyota don’t ya Kevin
I never cared for Toyota until I was forced into buying an 03 Corolla because it was cheap and needed wheels. They just work and are the easiest thing to work on. They even have base line specs and clearances on the underside of the hood, like the valve lash for example.
Did you just try putting it in neutral to start ?
How much for the camper
Is this for sale?
Old fuel is not as good as new.
The fuel pump is turned on when the MAF is pulling air while cranking.
Too fun. Love the possum!😂
Nice episode
Id buy it hahaha that thing goes
"Braxon the dog™"
Why did the possum look just like Bevis or Butthead ? 😂😂😂
Awesome duo. The most enjoyable video so far, and a cool retro camper.
🍻🍻👍
100K miles?! Thats barely broke in by someone's standards. Great find, Kevin! That camper is MINT yet. She's a keeper!
Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis is caused when a opossum poops on grass/feed for horses and cows. I will continue to blam them for the rest of my days
so glad you could find a Toyota for less then 10g. welcome to the yota gang
I actually own one from 1987 and I've done two 3500 to 4000 miles trips with it and it's awesome. 15mpg and doesn't like going above 55mph, but super solid and reliable campers
i have a very good friend who has the manual diesel version of it, with a brush guard on the front and a spoiler fitted to the top of the brush guard to help deflect the wind up and over it, its a very surprising vehicle, he towed a car behind it one day and i thought we were just gonna crawl home in 2nd gear but nope once it got up to 60mph it held it just fine!
love the content u guys make what brand of gopro do u use and what do u use what editing software do u use let me know please
Gotta get some more foreign cars on the channel, love it
I would of been out in the woods for months trying to figure this out
27:33 thanks for the canada shout out. Long live Red Green. Remember to kerl your stick on tbe ice.🇨🇦
sweet little camper would love to find a small one like it to restrmod
Hi guys for safety please check the grill on the outside for the furnace intake and exhaust. Mud daubers and hornets can block the air flow and sometimes build nests that can stop the furnace fan from being able to turn . Ask me how i know  ha ha. Use a strong flashlight to look into the outside grill to check. Have a nice day. Tom up in Canada
Hi guys on the freezer door in the frig that keeps falling down. The simple fix is to install a small "turn button" out of a thin piece of aluminum  about 1/2 inch by 1inch with a pivot screw that is just  snug enough to keep it in position to hold the freezer door closed except when you want to open it. Have a nice day. Tom up in Canada in the Maritimes at the NB-NS border
Hi guys when you need a mag glass to read print-----use your phone to take a pic and then enlarge it on the phone  to view  Tom up in Canada in the Maritimes at the NB-NS border Have a nice day.
I am Desperate for a camper like this 😢.  I am trapped in a hoarders house with out the financial means to get out.  I am waiting for Housing but they have a waiting list of 5 year waiting list. 8m disabled and on disability so my finances are under $1,000 a month.
I really enjoy your videos most of the time.   lol
You know youre just drunk enough when you pull a possum off a tree
I love the way you quote Rd Green. Keep your stick on the ice!
That would be really cool to have worthy of road tripping again
Gotta invest in a power probe. Its a lifesaver for electrical
I call major BS. On that thing having sat right there for more than a year.  Weeds would have been grown up differently around and under it. Also the tires didnt even look like they left a dead spit where they sat. Also any camper with 100,000 miles of use and then parked closed up in the woods is not going to smell just fine. Anyway .a guy needs to make content i guess.
A keeper
Great vid guys. Love the “ admission” that this old toad actually impressed you.   It looked like junk but you actually noted it might just be worth someone’s effort to suck a little more simple fun out of it
How much for it I need a place for me and my little girl please I really need it
Very popular C class conversion on a Toyota one ton frame. I’ve seen examples in good condition going for over $10,000. Underpowered but reliable AF.
😂😂 Comedy gold this episode
always good to see a well behaved dog. seemed like a sweetheart
I love my old Toyota pickup. I’ve been very close to getting the blue version of that thing 😂
Was that Mook lurking in the doorway
Not a bad little camper at all. The camper body looks quite good too. It could do with some modernization, perhaps with a couple of solar panels, new upholstery and things like that, and a good inspection of the technical aspects (chassis, suspension, brakes, etc.). I like it 👍
Yoter power!
Just discovered y'all's channel yesterday morning with the "c10hhh" video. I've loved every video I've seen so far. Love what y'all do!
Never seen yall work on a Toyota before, but im not complaining! Btw let me say Ezra is a great addition to the channel! Dude seems very chill
Is that Clark Duke? 😂
Im a simple man, I see Ezra, I like video. And 32:48 had me 💀💀
Why would you say most were standard when the opposite is true. I guess that may be because most that make it on-line(for sale) are standard. Automatics are usually sold as soon as the owner thinks about selling them. I waited three years to get mine, 91, V6 FI, 4A. 160k klicks $17000 15 years ago, put another 100k klicks on it with normal maintenance.  If in good working order  Those older 4 bangers go for $5k to $15k depending on condition and if it has the upgraded axel.
Possum's are great,their nature's garbage disposal,plus they eat alot of ticks!!
Tbh I'd buy this from him if you'd let me
The drunken adventures are always the best, dude strait up adopted a possum
Spooky Mook (pause at min 27:53) in the screen door scared the tater tots out of me!
The amount of ads on this video makes it nearly unwatchable. Plus you have a separate sponsor. I want to support creators, but there is a limit to everything. Hard Pass..
I just barely found out about your channel right now and this is Awesome
Do you really need an ad every two minutes.. Shit.. And you have a sponsor.. Freakin' greedy as hell.
I'd love to see you or someone do a "will it run" and resurrection of a minivan.
Awesome toyota!
AHAH Great
Thank you and Ezra for a very funny video. It was hard not to laugh too hard and wake the wife. The bit with the possum and the references to our home town hero Red Green, made my day. Hope you made a good deal on the sale of the camper. It looks awesome.
One of your best videos ever
I've always liked the little Toyota campers. I had a 22R and my 81. Toyota ran like a champ 4x4 It went anywhere I told it to. But once it blew the top radiator hose that took about Less than five minutes to warp the head After that it never ran right.
Oreagone? Ummm...thats Orygun.
Would love something just like this for my upcoming honeymoon. Good find and buy. Thanks for the video!
did you sell it yet?
I always admired those RVs and recall seeing more than a few on the road and in campgrounds. I may have year models/manufacturers wrong, but I seem to recall a federally mandated recall because of rear axle failures back when the RVs were new production. Sadly, the RV industry and truck manufacturers have forgotten those of us who don't want or need every bell and whistle know to automotive science and just want an RV that we can drive to the beach or hill country for a weekend outing and have opted for $200,000+ and up houses on wheels that only a few folks want or can afford. If the Lovely Bride and I were to stumble up on a well-maintained Toyota based RV like yours, we would buy it and utilize it every chance we got.
11:00 sounds like a airplane
how does this guy keep finding these cars
Also all the lights come on when starting when it’s running u should be worried if there still there
Also there should be a sticker on the front end of the valve cover saying 22re or etc
Most likely it has a inline 4 the 22-r or the 22r-e
Hey
Make a vid on the foxbody
if you accepted 4 to 6 merch i will buy when it comes to 7 PM Central Time
How long did it take to sell this Kevin ? This had to be the fastest sell in channel history
So Kevin jumps on the toyota bandwagon 25 years later than everyone else
U seriously under estimate these .I had one and loved it
1. That engine sounds like a lawnmower.  2. Ezra is a pretty man!
I’d crap in the woods. There is no ticks or chiggars out in late November
damn my VW 1.9tdi is almost as fast as this
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!!!  CHECK YOUR REAR AXLE!!!  TOYOTA WAS SUED BECAUSE OF THE REAR AXLES LITERALLY COMING OUT COMPLETELY CREATING AN ~~oh shite~!~ moment!!!!!  THEY MADE TOYOTA COMPANY PROVIDE A FREE  DUALLY REAR AXLE TO ANYONE OWNING A CLASS-C TOYOTA CAMPER!!!!!!  MY 86 TOY MINNI-WINNEBAGO WARRIOR  HAS THE DUALLY AXLE!!!
Sunland Express. I had one. Made me a nervous wreck every time i drove it. Ended up selling it. 62 mph was all it had.
Can you deliver to Newfoundland Canada? I want some of your merch
Ezra has strong Clark Duke vibes.
I was surprised that you were so surprised at how well those old Toyotas just keep on running. Toyotas in the era were so solidly built. As you saw. I never buy domestics, it's always gonna be a Toyota, Honda, or Mazda for me. Some cars you just can't kill
I think this deserves a tune up and some fresh tires its pretty good!
Our Blessed Hope, our Savior Jesus Christ. Do you know him? Do "you", ("whoever" is reading this), know Jesus? Even more, are you "Saved"? If Jesus were to return today, "now", would you be ready? Are you ready? That is the one question that you, and everyone, better know the answer to, because that is the most important decision you will ever make. Jesus is the "ONLY WAY TO SALVATION". There is no other way, "none". This "life" that you are living now, is a "limited" existence. The life after this is "ETERNAL", which brings us to another question: "Where do you want to spend eternity?" Well, you have only "two" choices: either "HEAVEN" or "HELL"! Not everyone will go to Heaven and likewise not everyone will go to Hell. It's your choice! It's always been your choice. Have you ever wondered why we all don't go to Heaven? Well, it's because of just one thing. But that "one" thing "separates" us all from God, and that one thing, is "SIN"! We are all born into sin, everyone is, and the Bible says that the wages (penalty) of sin is "Death". You see, because of our sins, when we all die, we are all "eternally separated" from God. But you know what? God Loves you so much that he made a way for you, for all of us. The Bible also teaches us that even though the penalty (wages) for our sins is death, we can gain SALVATION (a GIFT FROM GOD) through his only begotten son, Jesus Christ. God made a way! He sacrificed his only son, for "you"! That's how much he Loves you.   ROMANS 6:23 kjv For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   Here's the GOOD NEWS, (THE GOSPEL) Jesus took your sins and paid your sin debt in full. He took all your sins, past, present and future, to the Cross, shed his Blood and literally DIED for your sins, was buried and then God raised him from the dead three days later. Anyone who believes in the finished work of Jesus Christ will be Saved. That's THE GOSPEL (which means GOOD NEWS).  1 CORINTHIANS 15:1-4 kjv 15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.  He paid the price so you don't have to. Jesus is the ONLY ONE who could. He is the ONLY WAY.  JOHN 14:6 kjv  6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  God gives you, all of us, this "GIFT", because he Loves you. How much does God Love you? Well, let me ask you this: "Could you sacrifice your only child?" That is exactly what our Heavenly Father did. He gave (sacrificed) his only begotten son, Jesus, for "you", for the "WHOLE WORLD"!  JOHN 3:16-18 kjv  16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  Please, don't let Gods "sacrifice" (for you) be in vain. Jesus "died" for you. Please "Live" (eternally) for him.
you can use your phone camera as a magnify glass just zoom in
I got a buddy that uses a corndog stick to work a relay on the passenger side of one of those trucks not an rv but the same truck idve never found that myself works the power for the whole truck to itll turn on but wont do anything till you put the stick in the relay don't know why he don't just buy one but hey if it works it works
So I'm assuming you figured out the issue broke it again so you can drag it out into your backyard behind the tree line so you can pretend to fix it on camera
Can you deliver to Newfoundland Canada? I want some of your merch.
👍😁
Cheers fam
overall a very good one  quite   lucky
It sounds like a push mower lmao
How much would you want for it, I've been looking for one
Hilarious video😂😂
Merry Christmas the shitter is full....aaahhh nostalgia 👌👌👌👌
"Don't worry. I was an Eagle Scout." He says as he uses carb cleaner as lighter fluid. You sir were 100% a scout. I never made it to Eagle, but I was in a troop that would burn all wood that wasn't nailed down...yes we used two cans of lighter fluid during a week of scout camp/summer camp.
P.s. , knew a man back in early 70s , he had a Daihatsu 3 wheeler with " notso hotso " on the sides 🛺 👍
Ezra , you are a cool guy with a cool name👍
As for the fuel pump situation, I had a similar problem with an old Mazda, the pump won't run and prime the system, you had to jump it much like you did just to build initial pressure, then it will run no issues unless you lose prime again
Fun video!  Best to make sure there are no nests or debris at furnace vent.
Is everyone in Iowa this weird?
Ezra needs to be on the channel more often. 😂😂
Just for those who aren't in the know the "mass airflow sensor" "the flappy door thingy that basically just tells the truck that the motor is sucking" controls everything all of the communication to and from the ECU run through the mass then through the TPS if either of those are bad the whole truck just stops working
I want this thing
is there a way to spice up the 22re?
Toyota strong
Serious question is it a viable business to fix and sell the cars like you do or do you sell them to just make room
Did you sell it yet...i live in iowa
I cant believe what great shape that is in.
SUMMIT RACING V8 BARBECUE!!!!
LS swap it
That toyota looks really cool. Japanese  cars never die, its proven again.
Dude would love to see you do like a toyota hilux (pickup) from the early 80s the were a mint little off roader
lol yes please come to Oregon and Hit me up lol
Fun fact in the early 90s the ecm was built in such a way you need a radio to allow signal pass through because it was first gen they used duel fuze boxes they thought this would be good they forgot that those radios break easily they were wired weird and needed the radio for pass through and signal regulation it was the so called easy method tho it just made it harder on the mechanic cause normally a radio didnt matter
Id kill for a camper like this planning to travel in spring hopefully ill find a gem
Damn, a Toyota pickup based camper is like the holy grail of campers in my opinion. This one seems to be a great condition and the added bonus of it being new enough to have EFI rather than the carb.
I love this channel...
Did you even check the oil??
How do we contact you about your RV's
How can we try and buy the campers you  show
These little 22RE  Motor homes are legendary and have quite the cult following.  You'll probably find that it's practically impossible to kill the engine. The only downfall I remember was that they are gutless and 55 mph is about their max speed and only achieved on flat smooth roads. Going over mountains will take forever.
Not the blower motor bet mice brought acorns into it happens every year to my wife’s Mazda
The red green comments surprised me from young men
the fact its on a toyota lol
Had a little Dolphin for a while; got it for $300 as a fixer.  Tried my damndest to kill it and failed miserably.  Good find.
22R motors are indestructible, and the 80s Toyotas are tanks.
Toyotas do indeed fix themselves, i have a 96 starlet i paid £50 for. Done 11k miles in it now and other than basic maintenance its only got better.. interior light fixed itself, dashboard clock fixed itself, horn fixed itself.. its marvellous
These campers where ledgends in the 80s
Just an FYI: On the early Toyota pickup and van fuel systems with the 'door-type' airflow meter, the engine needs to be cranking to activate the fuel pump solenoid. Once the air door is pulled open by engine vacuum, it will continue to feed power to the pump relay and maintain fuel pressure. That's why when you taped up the tube between the throttle body and the AFM, it would continue to run. BTW, the big fat screw sticking out of the top of the throttle body about 1/4" or so is the base idle speed screw. In most cases it will be about level with the throttle body or a little below, which would equate to about 750 rpm. With the odometer at 100,000+ miles, it would be a good idea to do the timing chain and gears, if it hasn't been changed already!😉
The "R"series engines Toyota had from the late 70's into the early 90's were second to none. They were Toyota's answer to Ford's 302 and 4.6 V8's. They're just a workhorse of an engine.
Is Ezra Canadian? 🇨🇦
Where is Mook?
Aren’t you going to take Mook camping in it?
If I lived anywhere close to Iowa, I would come and take it off your hands. All it needs is a timing chain and guide replacement, a transmission service and new coolant and it is ready for the next 100K miles. At 200K, that is the "broken in" point for those 22R-E's.
Old Toyotas never die lol
this content is golden!
Gosh you guys make that look so easy. I would love to be able to come along on one of these (mis)adventures one day; looks like a lot of fun!
Kevin great vid
it's a good candidate to throw a 4 banger diesel engine 4 speed manual Trany
Is that a 22-RE?
Red green references :)
Sounds like one of dem arow ay
Thats a sweet little rv. They go for big bucks in the northwest.
that might even be 100.000km instead of miles
That’s what I’m talking about merry Christmas 🌲Tater 💥💥
It may have already been mentioned, but the AFM (similar function to a MAF sensor) triggers the fuel pump. Basically, it needs to see enough air flow to send power to the fuel pump relay. The ripped boot was likely the biggest problem the PO faced when trying to get it running. Your problem now may just be slow cranking/low air flow when cold. You didn’t do it any favors by closing the throttle to lower the idle and vacuum leaks just add to the problem.  Cool little RV though. A good tune up, timing chain (check for for excess wear on the timing cover), and it’ll be good for another 100k miles. Those engines never made much power, but their long life is directly attributed to that.
1000000 she’s just run in ! Bulletproof motors !
This is truly something i miss from my youth. No, not the camping per se, i´ve done that many times. But when you get old you get comfy. I have a hard time beliving that i could lie on that sofa, much less sleep on it a full night. These young (oh, well, -ish..) men have no problem whatsoever. I would have lying there thinking about the bugs, pubic hair, milldue, sars and aids thats roaming around in the fabric.. So, it´s not just fun to wacht because the car repair, but to see how boundries are no problem for these guys. More videos, pls!
Willie E Coyote is currently trying to sue ACME
Perfectly honest here, are y'all selling this? This model range of Toyota truck has huge childhood factor to it, and this thing seems in overall good nick!
Best way to fix things hold it to the floor.  Smh
lose Man-bun and bring back Mook.
The intake manifold reminds me of one side of a TPI  manifold. lol
Check the codes. On live test, check for fluctuating timing advance readings indicating worn timing belt or chain.
When you come across cars like that, check battery drain first. Pour Marvel Mystery Oil in the cylinders to remove rust. Let it sit and then crank the engine to remove it. Change the oil.
how much you selling for
Lucky I did my Christmas tree  shopping  already I got a tree and decorations for free  and a few other things
"thats a nic fookin kitty right there"😂😂😂
My first vehicle was an 86 Toyota 22r. Le sigh I miss it
😮
It's not every day you hear a Red green reference
You guys need to team up for some more Fargo accent dialogue!
Just wanted to chime in with this; NEVER use MAF sensor cleaner on older japanese cars until you know for sure that it is an actual MAF sensor. A lot of these use what's known as a Karman Vortex Flow Meter, which is a really fancy way of saying "small piece of tinfoil in a tube." IIRC somehow the frequency of the piece of foil vibrating is measured and that's how it determines flow rate. If you shoot high-pressure *anything* at the right spot on the sensor it'll kill it instantly.
swap it out for an LS 🤣🤣 fast as funk.
I love your bids man
What about watching Shrek?
21:34 - Hail Cornholio! 🤣
Not every car maker needs a v8 with 7 litres to make 150 bhp
Best opening line ever!
I smell a rat. Nevermind it's a possum. Ezra I'd a good sidekick. Your a regular Laurel & Hardley.
I want to buy this camper if possible how do i message you?
Wheres the spicy nova?!!  Pl3ase update!
35:39 i died 😂
Gets reminded of fiat possum
ha ha, this really brings back memories. i owned one of these, 79 i believe. forget what it was, as they made them with different names like dolphin,etc. the 20r i think, or 22r, whatever it had had a hard life when it was rolling. the thing barely got to 55-60mph on the highway (if it was flat), and got as slow as 45 mph climbing grades. it was too slow in my opinion to be on the highway. and i dont want to scare you, it looks like you have the duel axle. these were made with a tandem axle too. i forget the specifics, but some years that had the duel axle were prone to a wheel snapping off .but i forget the story behind the duel axle and tandem axle. but tandem axle was a bit safer. good luck with it, and if you get on the highway, better put some high powered amber strobelights on the rear and get used to cars and 18 wheelers flying by you so fast . no, i would never own another. it did have the coldest ac .. good luck with it! its a truck thats better to park in a field somewhere on like a remote camping ground and leave it,  20 years ago when i owned it, there was a yahoo group of these owners that discussed these trucks, if its still there. but i think you should research the axle situation.
If you dont like that bible you can gift it to me then 😇 i also got a toyota hilux camper 😊 also if you’re going to sell it let me know
the shitters full
How is mook doing I haven't seen her in a while
The last time my blower motor vibrated like that, it was a dead mouse in the fan.....
My oldest grandson is named Ezra. He 💩's the toilet full too 🤣
never worked on perfect ingenuity and reliability?
you could drive to LA and set up camp. In fact i have seen one of these in Australia and I reckon it could make a great home. Idle screw was above that thing you bent with the pliers....
Man this channel gives me the giggles!!!😂😂
ha made 5 bucks betting u would get it running in under 10 mins thank u sir great video
That is the largest weed wacker motor I've ever seen🤣😂🤣😂
the intro is gold pure gold
That was awesome! I've seen a few of these campers on marketplace but passed over them. I'm going to reconsider. If I had the money, I'd buy that one off of you today!
I love possums. That one was very conflicted on whether or not to be scared. On one hand, danger monkey, on the other, rubs and warmth.
Interested in buying. Price?
I saw one of those on the Parkway in the NC mountains that had a license plate "TURTLE".
I love those little campers I been trying to find one like that
ticking is probably timing chain slapping the cover. the guides are plastic and break around that mileage.
I want to buy the camper I been looking  for one in the shape that one is
A lot of people take the axels and make mini duallies with s10’s and rangers they look especially good if they are a square body ranger/ s10. Edit: Not suggesting that just giving a little bit of random facts
🎄
Holy cow. Those are some of the most sought after . Hopefully you can revive her. Those RE 22 4 cylinder engines are some of most reliable. Bullet proof
Fun fact about 80s license built Bosch L Jettronic systems. The fuel pump doesn't prime with the key. It runs off the AFM "barn door" circuit. Took me like 2 weeks to figure that golden nugget out when I first got my Mk2 Celica Supra.
You may not be old enough to know that U-haul used to have a fleet of those they rented for moving(they weren't campers but box vans).
He needs to go to church LOL
U should take it to Ur next nascar trip. Better than the poopmobile.
/relays
I want to buy it. Seriously I got cash in hand.
holy crap! Red Green references!
Years ago we had a 1984 version of this camper, ours was a 4 speed carbureted version. Still wish we'd saved it because it ran well.
A Buick V6 will bolt right into those old Toyota's with very few modifications. A friend had a 1 ton dump truck and he said it was an easy swap.
This episode reminds me so much of Top Gear. Just need a narrator and Stig. I laughed so hard at the possum clip!
I could use that me and my wife are sleeping  in my little van
I would love to buy this camper been looking for one for a while
4:08 pm  it is dark here in NH
I want it haha. What would sell it for?
I suggest a proper oil check/change!
Funny enough as soon as this video was posted I seen an identical camper and my state for sale.
Toyota 4 cylinders are obnoxiously adequate…  never great, but adequate.
Sounds like it needs a diesel swap
Toyotas never die. ❤
I would love to own that thing
More mini trucks!!!!
The issue I have with tiny wallet's is they are easy to lose and loosing a wallet sucks
Great video as usual my friend!
Does that truck have the 22R in it? if it does they are a good little engine and Toyota used them for many years the 22R is the carb model and the 22R-E was with EFI. if it has a 100 thousand miles it's a good idea to replace the timing chain because that's right around when they start to get loose and cause issues anyway that is a cool rig and should be good on gas
What in the Brokeback Camping is this?
Y'know, they say if you let a transmission sit for over 10 years, you should run it briefly without fluid, helps give the gears some grab again.     (This is a joke)
Saweeeet camper video, definitely not a zzzzzzzzer video, loved your off the tree pet possum...
Nice
I love watching your camper/rv revivals. I just wish you would do more improvements/restoration on em like sleeperdude does.
Old Toyota's are the greatest cars ever built
Proof Toyotas are immortal. Removing parts made it run better haha
AS soon as you said it was a Toyota, I knew it'd start up no problem, but seeing your guys' reaction to it was amusing. Now y'all understand the hype round these trucks and the overall brand
Ezra is funny, can we keep him?....
hey what happened to the Beans? Farming with old equipment was my favourite series!
So I've figured out why I wasn't seeing new videos...I was no longer subscribed after years of following.
Clean it up, put a timing chain in it because it was common on these to wear and eat through the cover.(i think that sound is the dreaded chain failure.) it'll sell for 5-6k rust free.
Broke back mountain😬😳
Till you have Opossums in the ceiling of the garage,then they chew their way into the rest of the house...
SOOOOO my driveway would LOVE  that beauty sitting in it AKA I really fuqing want it ❤❤❤❤❤😢
hey if i buy 4 merch for myself and buy 10 more for the people around me will it let me do that much when it comes to my taxes
My dad drives a toyota hilux with over 400k km on it, he's just now considering re-doing the engine as its never been done before, just re-did the transmission on it though, it was very loose. think its a 99 model.
That thing is in really good shape for being almost 40 years old.  Glad you got it running and gave it a second chance at life.
That possum got a lot friendlier since the Fiat 850…hey buddy!
Omg the dust pan prayer 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Matt @ Demoranch is wearing your hat on today’s episode!!!   Please oh please be his return guest!  🙏 I am hoping the hat is a hint lol ❤
Hell yeah! I learned working on Japanese engines, so it's pretty cool to see you working on a Japanese truck. Love to see it.
That thing gonna sell quick
Damn Kevin sir, once again you find an amazing find on marketplace. That camper is in really good shape for its age. I’m going to have to keep an eye out for it when you post it up again. I was really impressed also that everything still work. Iron out the bugs in it and you’ve got yourself a great buy! Looked like you guys had a fun night with beers, dogs and tots!!! Great video guys!!! 👍🏻
Run, drive, make up your mind man!
Mooks transition went great!
I really wish I was there to help you guys cuz I have a 1986 toyota pickup and know the ins and outs of it
Kevin PLEASE take care of this camper! It's a Toyota and will last forever if you just show it some maintenance love! My uncle daily drives a 5 speed 1987 Corolla that is still going strong with just routine maintenance!
wish i was a camping kind of guy..those are great rigs
If you have hi self esteem do you find yourself being better than Ezra? 😂😂
Now that you're certified Toyota Master Technicians, come to Ohio and help me figure out my 85 22RE pickup.
i wish i could have such car
Is that a guy or a chick?
Simple and sweet opossums kill tics more than any animal.
Had a 22RE in an 89 4 runner. Lasted over 300k, no overhaul, just regular maintenance. Rest of the truck rotted out, but was still running strong when I sold it. Best engine Toyota ever made, probably why they stopped making it. By the way, those are great little campers. A friend had one back in the 80s and got about 15 mpg with it.
I would love to live in this camper Kevin be it I ain't going to have a home during Christmas this year it's looking?
Look at this guy! He's here, cuddling with a possum, quoting red green and trailer park Boys... he's damn near a Canadian!
Spray brake clean at the vacuum lines when it revs up you found the leak.
I have a little crappy microwave in my garage and when it's cold and I need Lucas Trans fix, I nuke the thing for half a minute, it comes RIGHT out!!
5 speed way more fun...
That's so ugly it's awesome lol
Shiters full!!  😂😂😂
just saw a yota camper for sale by me in ohio on marketplace, made me think some youtuber should revive one and boom i see this 🤣
Kevin I got a ford camper that was going to try get it going the problem is there is no power any where except at the battery and starter from celaniod?
I can't believe he took a possum  off the tree  started pet it like a cat I wish I could have watch it right came out. Kevin great video buddy.
Yay Ezra
Ole' possum county hot dogs
I love those Toyota Dolphins
Its a dam shame we didnt get theese in Denmark...... Its all coverted old peugeot small flat bed trucks
Great video!
Ezra is awesome,  need to have him on more often.
Do you have any plans to rebuild the wagon engine?
I was sitting there slack-jawed when I saw you holding that possum! That was the epitome of drinking shenanigans! So awesome!
The timing chain guides are pretty much the only failure point on the 22R-E’s. I miss my ‘94 4wd 😢
32:49😂
When they get drunk i have some of my favorite laughs,just like when john make a cone into a bong
Just to throw this out there I guarantee there is a dead mouse in the blower motor lol
🇦🇺👍
I am lmaf 😂😂
Ahhh yeah, funky wires running from the positive cable is pretty common on RV's though.
I need this in my life always wanted one
💯🤍 HANDSOME👱🏻✨💪🏻🔥❤️
WARNING do not pick up wild animals and pet them if you don't know what your doing.  Kevin is a professional!
I’ve always wanted one of those compact Toyota camper. How much do you want for it?
very impressed with the lil guy, really surprised me with your luck on campers lol
Get in touch with Puddin's Fab Shop, I think he's got one just like it - you could have spares.
wana take a stab at my 78 dodge travco sometime
I want one of those campers.
"Thats it??"  It's a Toyota.  You could throw that whole thing into the sea, pull it out a year later, fill the engine with nutella and it would run.
I like that little camper
Does that mean next nascar race y’all taking the yota?
Man I love those little campers. I always wanted to throw a 4cyl diesel in one.
TO THE RACES!!!!
If you knew how possums eat dead cows you’d be putting that thing down.
Toyotas Are Epic🦾🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boo, that was too easy lol
The 22RE starts on a half turn .
Which dog bread was that braxton!
You’re working on my dream home❤ great job as always
Y'all should do video on bicycles cuz that's all y'all know probably
3SGTE swap it.
How in the world do you do videos YouTube
You don't even know what a good vehicle is that vehicle probably Outlast anything that you ever owned
If you pull the dip stick half way out, you can pour the trans fluid down the dipstick to fill it
Yall sure that ain't yall valves making all that noise?
If you explode, it would be a shame if it WASN'T on camera.
Random comment
I would love to find one for me and my mom so we could camp sometimes
LOL - "Ahhhh! The bible!"
I think I saw this on fb marketplace last year, cause I almost bought 😂 glad you got it and got it running!!
It would be smart to get the battery and use like a jackery battery module to get some more power into the system.
You guys are nuts. But i am too. LOL
You have lots of fun, much love
Can you say as·phyx·i·a·tion
Two things I love most, RV's and tater tots!  Fun Fact:  Tater tots invented by 2 Mormon brothers here is Ontario, Oregon.....who knew?
Hey Kev, Make sure you check the lug number, they made a 5 lug and 6 lug.. the 5 lugs had a big issue with the floating rear.. there's toyota TSB's all over the place.. nice find otherwise..
Twisted ice tea and hot dogs. Now that is roughing it. :)
DaiTOTsu
21:34 - Heh, heh, heh...
the dirty windows irritate me so much haha
opossums are awesome.North America's only marsupial.
Ight ima need a Toyota RV shirt with a possum made up, so I can buy one please, that rig needs a cool name too lol
Had one but be very careful and never forget to chock the wheels or the automatic trans will pop out of gear and youll find yer RV down in the bottom of the lake.
I shoulda brought deodorant 😂
Man this is wild, never seen these before, then i saw one on fb marketplace. A week later, 3 more. A week later, JYD uploads a video on one 😂 where the heck did these all come from
Were you really an eagle scout?
those 22r motors were junk from day one i blew up 4  of them before i gave up all the while people talking about how great those trucks were
Whoa an Opossum friend ❤😊
Wow a Red Green line!  Impressive, maybe you got yourself some Canadian in ya!
That thing is in great shape! Whatcha got her priced?
Love Ezra's sense of humour.
couple relays and your good to go.
nunkdard yigs
You know its been a mighty good hydration session when you end up cuddling with a possum.
Can't beat the old Toyota camper. Runs tiptop shape. Also The possum got me. That was pretty funny.
Possum King and his Toyota 😂 you guys didn't fix anything other than hot dogs and beers, oh wait maybe a hole in the roof 😂 awesome video guys 👍✌️🇺🇲
I’ve had 4 different cars / trucks with 22R and 22RE motors. Also worked Toyota full time for years. Alot of times these would come in with a blown head-gasket complaint only to find the worn timing chain / broken plastic guides would eat threw the front cover coolant jacket.
Drunk guy holds a forest kitty. Adorable.
Puddins Fab shop had one of those but somebody took the camper off of it and put a flatbed on it and it was actually a dually so I thought that was pretty cool great content keep up the good work
The mass air flow sensor has a switch that activities the fuel pump as soon as vacuum is detected.
🔥🔥👍
Little known fact: If you rev the crap out of a Toyota Hilux it fixes itself.
The Mini Trucks were very popular back in the 60's &  70's, when I got out of the military the first time I had a nice Datsun Mini truck for a few years. Nice to see another video, but ? No MOOK ?
The Bible fell
We definitely need to see more Toyota content 🤠
The opossum was too cute I have them in my yard so adorable ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hi sir I've been a subscriber for a little bit now and I wanted to know if you would be willing to donate that Toyota RV to me and my dog I ran into a string of bad luck and my vehicle impounded due to no insurance and bad tags I can't get it out cuz I lost my job when that happened and now I'm about to be homeless that would be a perfect vehicle for me and my dog I would say I'd see about buying it but I barely have a dollar to my name I'm sorry I'm even asking about this but if not I understand
Good.job Nice camper congratulations you show 😄👍👍👍👏👏
Ever since I can remember I remember seeing those campers and I realize they’re gutless wonders but I’ve always wanted one but up here and Canuckida  Everybody seems to be asking a premium even for piece of shit clapped out jalopies
Woah woah woah WAS an Eagle Scout?? Once an Eagle always an Eagle bud. 8/28/12
Love to see a Toyota on the channel. My 1997 T-100 pickup has about 251k miles on it and is showing no signs of giving up (yet)
I forget how noisy the 22re is. It does sound like a bottom end knock but like we know it's not
Hay Kevin,  I used to live in waterloo Iowa, my parents moved back home. U know any Backes, Andsons, Weber,  Gathoffs, or maybe Good?? Love u videos,  I love iowa to. Now in Wichita, ks lol
Why does that sound like a lawn mower
well you got this thing running pretty good. needs some cleaning lol, might be a good camper at some time. messing with possums not advised here in SC they dont carry rabies but have razor sharp teeth and make a bad day for those who mess with them. thanks for the video. quite enjoyable
Please keep this camper and make it better
Love the vids. Hope you keep the backyard mechanic vibes and relatable content as things get bigger and bigger.
My 4 girls, myself and their mom all slept in my buddies dolphin for almost a month in NY 8 years ago.  Thing was comfy.
Can i pet that dawg? @29:05  In all seriousness, the thumbnail should be you cuddling Greg
Fusible links
How much for it
The opossum was hilarious!
How much you wanting for it? I lowkey might be interested 😂
If that rig has a 22R-E engine, it will accelerate like a comatose sea slug. You will not be able to break that engine though, they are Toyota bulletproof.
lol nice one of first motors i worked on simple
23:32 one of my dream truck body styles..
what kind of toyota is it? a Hilux? Tacoma? or is it called the camper
that's actually a great looking little camper in what looks to be pretty great shape.  I bet there would be quite a few people who would pay to have that.  great video guys!
Toyota it just works
Love the Christmas vacation reference at the start of the video😂
More Toyotas!
Ask  George to sing you a song.
Missed opportunity to call it the "Possom Lodge"  edit: #15 on trending and he says s*itters full within the first minute 😂
I have a suggestion: even though the 22re is an absolute bulletproof engine, you could slap a 350 sbc in that sucker and take it to the races next year! That would be something to see. Thanks for the great content, Kevin! (And Mooker) Keep it up, y’all! God bless!
Mook not doing videos anymore???
How much are we talking price wise
i love these camper videos. by far the better of the videos
Funny enough there was an old couple that drove one of these to my church. Ed and Lonnie.
I would guess a wire cut under the dash for the neutral safety. Love the content man
2JZ
lol when i saw the thumbnail i knew this would be the easiest revival ever, 22RE never die!!
YouTube is doing some weird shit, second time I was unsubbed from the channel.
Keep it for next years nascar race
Does he need to ease up on the happy juice
My first truck was a 77 hilux with the 20r these engines are literally impossible to break
Used to work on these old toyota trucks at the dealership true that the 22re is a remarkable engine but has allot of vacuum lines and emissions crap that 20+ years later can turn it into a non efficient vehicle if you don’t know what your doing but still a thoroughbred workhorse
thanks for making all of these great videos! are yall planning on working more on that early bronco soon? I have a 74 I'm restoring at the moment.
Will Greg join you on revivals from now on?
yay finally an 80s toyota. the rheostat behind the glovebox is for the aftermarket air conditioning. the fuel pump is triggered off the flapper door in the AFM. that thing also desperately needs a timing chain.
I love that camper and year shenanigans! Awesome 👍
Man I love key want to fly down there buy it and drive it back to Canada
that's toyota for you.
@2:53 you could probably fit a Lexus 1UZ  4.3 in there!!  She'll be a lil RIPPER wagon!!😂🥃
I always thought that one of these would be great for a v8 swap
That's an easy $10k+ in California
115 horse motor. Cannot even hold speed up a slight grade.  That rear axle was also very weak.
"Merry Christmas, the shitter's full!!!!"
Just Looking at the idle air adjustment screw on the throttle body at 14:57 makes me think that the high idle is being caused by that. When I compare it to how my fathers' 85 toyota truck looks like, yours is out my at least a quarter inch in comparison. Just know that if you ever do a timing chain, you need to remove the distributor in order to get at a bolt hiding underneath. Love the content as always.
Kevin had from what i can tell always loved opossums 😂a lot of videos have his wild friends in them lol
If you’re selling the ole girl I might be interested
Awesome Kevin! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Dear lord that possum would scare me to death with that open mouth toothiness...  I would never shoot or hurt one, just not going to grab one out in the woods.    A friends brothers had a toyota based camper similar to that one, called a Dolphin if i remember right.  It was a basic machine, and i recall it taking forever to stop.  :)
I think if you tried to pull a feral cat out of a tree and held it you would get fucked up, possums are not like cats.
Ezra had me laughing a few times. Always a great addition to an adventure.
Once an Eagle always an Eagle! 🦅
I have to say I've seen a few of your videos with campers in them but this one truly is a collection piece I absolutely love these old Toyota campers besides being underpowered they were fantastic little vehicles and the one that you got seems to be just about in mint condition please take care of her
This is why I like Toyotas if you take care of them they run forever
Sounds like my 03 echo!!!!
I always love c n these old rides put back to use good score Kevin. enjoy the content u put out💯
I had an '84 Hilux (that's before they were called Tacomas). It had the 22ARRR pirate motor. It was carbureted, and what a great little truck. It was all white, with that same tan interior. It developed a vacuum leak one day. I went to the parts store and bought 20 feet of vacuum line. I guess the kid behind the counter wondered what I was going to do with all that vacuum line, but I replaced every one in the truck. One at a time. Pull one, cut new line to fit, replace. Repeat. That little truck was my daily for about ten years, and I drove it coast to coast. It had the five speed, and some days I still miss that little truck. It's about impossible to kill them unless you run them out of oil. All the best to you, and thanks for bringing back a bunch of great memories.
we nead a camper like that lol
Wish you would work on more yotas
I love seeing one of these trucks on the channel, but next let’s see a 22R 4x4 revival!!!
EZRA <3 & it drives better because its Toyota obvs
You two together are a hoot ! Please make more crazy fun content. Maybe a wee turbo would make it interesting?
Junkyard digs always gets an instant like on his videos, but bonus points for Ezra! The entire JYD crew is awesome, but we dont get to see Ezra nearly enough!
Best video I have seen in a long time. Two guys having a binge.
What a coincidence. I literally saw one of these things sitting in the local auto shop parking lot just yesterday.
a few years ago I was up by Mt Rushmore and saw several of these still being used
I find it funny that you are surprised that a 80s toyota works, like, the one thing they do is work
I love watching kevin and his camper adventures
Love the Trailer park boys reference.
Is beautiful caravan❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Which carburator for more horsepowers without destroying stuff can i use on a 1980 368 v8 cadillac?
That's the Nascar camper for this year if it's not I will be sad
Rad little camper! My manual '84 Celica is slow, I can't even imagine how slow that thing is lol
going on a "christmas vacation " kevin?
I love the videos with Ezra. Would love to see you guys do more stuff together. You guys are funny and it seems like you are just bro building shit. Love it
lmaof  top program mates
How much is it worth to you right now
Years ago when forums were still a relevant thing I followed a thread that must have been like 20 pages long of a guy that 1UZ swapped one of these, it was before YouTube so I never got to see it run but the way he described sounded like it was a match made in heaven. I think he got the engine and trans out of an old Lexus LS400, and being that it's only four cylinders long it fit in there perfectly!
First vehicle you've worked on that I actually want.
I haven't started the video yet, but I'd bet my left nut it'll run. I love those trucks! I always wondered how the mighty mini 22R did with a small house strapped to it though.
you cant beat Toyota all there trucks are better than the rest
A lifeless Toyota in the dark corners of the woods? Truly it must be the evil doing of the Blair Wrench.
I live in Oregon... Come on!!  Lol😊
find a 440 mopar big block dodge camper lol
Those 22re engines were bulletproof, I had 2 Celica gt's that had well over 300000 km on them and they always ran even after the body had rotted to nothing.
Yeeey a wild Mook appears
I've never smelt btu before😂😂😂
what do you want for this i might be interested in it. what state you in?
Love the Red Green reference
1000000 is nothing for a Toyota my tundra has almost 1/2 million miles on it, I have had to replace one coil pack and the o2 sencers but thats all , mine is a 03 and a v8 not the 22r
Mobile Possum Lodge nice.
I'm late to the game - this is the first video I've seen. I'll be working on catching up. This is primo content.
Great Lady Gaga reference
I want it lol
Trans is marked in pints, low... Four pints to a quart.
I guess you checked out the frame, These were known for bending in half.
that's a sweet camper!
Thats awesome, i need it! :) Japanese stuff is the Best, my favourite is Nissan Atlas, but its only right hand drive:(
Not even gonna lie I thought you had a weed eater going when you first started it😂
When you first started the engine after getting the fuel pump to work it sounded like a lawnmower
What a gem! In an alternative life, I'd love to own that thing and give it some TLC.
We love all the friends of junkyard digs but Ezra is absolutely killing it. Literally need his comments on every episode and the accent just tops it off 😂😂
If the timing chain is making noise, don't ignore. The chain guides are plastic and broke which it lets it slap the cover and will ware a whole in it and there is a coolant jacket it will rub into and cause problems
Omg. I'am want that old Toyota camper❤but i livin in the far A way In finland😢
How nice to see the young folk enjoying themselves!! Or, two overgrown schoolboys on the loose!! Great fun!@
That is the EFI Edition that puppy makes about 105 horsepower 47.4 miles per hour if you're going downhill
When you are used to American cars, anything else drives good...
Kevin, you and Ezra had me rolling... eyes watering.  So much fun.
A true Toyota, fires right up.
Idk which I enjoyed more, the pet possum or quoting Red Green
Ezra needs his own channel. Kid has a quick wit!
I like the Red Green show quote used to watch it all the time with my grandma growing up if you can't be handsome you can always be handy and carry a roll of duct tape. Love watching your videos
Kevin, got any imports laying around? id be interested if you come across any.
I was seriously concerned that you were gonna gas yourself with that propane heater
Good old boys, when a man finds a panel with switches the first thing he does is press them all, then talks about where to take a poo. Lol Sick video boys
If its anything like any Toyota ive owned, itll run and run for a long time.
22:30 Probably the only time in a video you yelled "Fire!" and it wasn't bad
Msn's heroine family keeps trying to epstine me to cover up there dope they keep trying to steal my kid any way shape or form for 30 years judge heroine Randolphe uses my brother as a pin cushion for 25 yeas and now judge lee is tryi g to epstine me. And there the homos from the big brother program. Me and my brother and there drugs arnt enough of an issue now they need to angle my kid. It's there drugs and she's only 10
Hey gooder is not a word 😂
How much Kevin?
Hello Kevin and Mook
Best part about these engines is when they do finally wear out to do all the ring, bearings, timing chain, and gaskets to freshen it up it under like 300 bucks
You need oil
Puddin’s Fab Shop needs this.
How much?
ide love to see you guys take it to a "rescue" but please fix that exaust leak.
Ezra is a great addition to the vids.
The best thing about this episode is Mook starring longingly at Brexton the dog Tm from behind the screen door
It's a Toyota! One of the best vehicles ever. Imo
If i had the money I'll buy that camper from you . But I'll let y'all work on it first  This mechanical maintenance
candidate for an LS swap LOL
Will this Old Camper RUN & DRIVE Out of the Woods?   it's toyota so yes
Reviving a Toyota is no fun, they never die
Im amazed at how the camper really didn't "fight you" about wanting to work again (..and i want it!)  Probably my all-time favorite video you guys have done so far! ..........Shoulda took the possum home and made it your mascot. LOL!  Love your content dude!
I was going to ask. Have you ever worked on a Toyota?
AS I JUST CAME BACK FROM CAMPING AAAAAAAAAAAA I CANT EXCAPE
One of the best vids!
How funny is Ezra?  So fun to watch the two of you.  Thanks!
I want something like this, maybe not exactly this one but one of similar style.
I was waiting for you to do the Toyota jump from the commercial jingle I love what you do for me 😂 Toyota .
Loved the possum part I knew you and I would get along but the possum sold it. I once had a possum that lived in my backyard named Oppy he used to eat my barf
"I never smelled BTU before" lol
Question: Will it run? Answer: It's an old Toyota, so yes it will. Question: Are you sure? it's been sitting in the woods for years and the electrical is all screwed up. Answer: You said it was an old Toyota right? Then yes, I'm sure...😉
21:27 Kevin, if you fill the camper with propane and explode I absolutely want it on camera. 😄
After half a bottle of whiskey I might ever hung an opossum 😂
Cool 😎
Nice Camper
those 22R and 22RE engines are easily the best and most reliable gas engines. they can easily hit 700k-1million miles with routine maintenance. and if it blows? put in a turbo diesel OM617 from Mercedes to swap.
that's what i'm saying possums have bin my favurite animal for two years
That is keep machine, the insides are better then anything else you took on the road lol.
The reason it drives better than the chevies is because it has a better engine. Once you look at something that's not American you can get the same power out of a straight 4 than your v6 will ever produce.
👍👍
HOW DO  I BUY THIS?!
Wish I were closer to the area and your FB Marketplace. That lil thing looks pretty decent for its year! Always wanted one since I was a kid..(strange pick, I know). Got a nice hit of nostalgia on this one. Good pick for a video guys!
Kev  Love to buy camp, and make a video of me driving it home. 5000 km away,  sorry 3100 miles. and a 16 hour ferry.     look up and as far east as you can go. small rock in the Atlantic Ocean. Newfoundland and Labrador. Love the channel. and love to Mook and all PBG families..  ONLY 3 things stopping me..   $  $ and $.
Here is a toast to the tater tots!!  🤣🤣 you guys are a riot!!   Oh and GREG!!
Anytime i see opossum i always think that it truly does look like kitten with down syndrome (as one wise man pointed out(and no i dont remember who it was)
These drunken camper videos are always a treat. Making friends with Opossums, what more could you ask for.
Very cool
One time i accidentally pepper sprayed a possum spraying my trash can with bear spray to keep the critters out. I felt terrible and tried to help but it was not having it and just bit me and ran away. 😅
Well now you just have to name the camper Possum Lodge!
For sale? ill even film it on its way back to texas?
Bro please do a video with puddin from puddins fab shop he loves toys
The camping part was a 10/10 😂The possum, the hotdogs 😅
I owned 4 of those trucks from about 1970 to the mid-90's; whenever they discontinued the Hi-Lux and introduced the Tacoma. You couldn't kill the drivetrains with a hydrogen bomb but unfortunately the bodies were made of papier-mache. I drove every one of my trucks to the crusher, but I could have just put my feet through the holes in the body and Flinstoned my way there too.  Probably never should have taken those trucks to an environment with snow, ice, and road salt. They might have lasted forever.
The engine is so tappety noisy, did you even change the engine oil?
Your idle issue is caused from the flat head plug located on top of your throttle body. That plug is almost all the way backed out, that should be about 1 turn out from fully closed.
Ha ha 4 banger. Welcome to our world!
Watching from over the pond 🇬🇧 great video we never got that type of toyota  camper over here
I like your possum but that camper in minty
Dang wasnt expecting the 4 cylinder. Ive worked on one that had a 4.7 V8 in it i figured they all were outfitted like that
turbo charge the sucker
Might be worth noting many residential propane values only seal when they are completely open or completely closed
A Toyota 3.4 swap into one of these would be perfect.
Lmao how much for the camper
Not a bad camper. Kevin should keep there possum!
Where you selling er?
Those 22re motors are unstoppable
Hi,Kevin- I saw that video and it was very good- didn’t you have a camper a while back that was older than that one? It was used not just for camping-anyway loved seeing you with the possum and treating it like scat a cat-that line about not having any delta   Deodorant cracked me up!! You are funny for words !😂😂😂😂
Duh, I always keep my dust pan on the roof of my camper. I don't know where else you would ever keep it.
I did not know a posssum was harmless.
Great Job, but it was a bit cringe-worthy watching you work on it. That old Toyota did gain your respect, but in the beginning you were just a tad harder on it that normal.  Being a Toyota super fan, it hurt just a little... But I got over it when you rescued that strange looking cat :-P  1986 was a strange year for the Toyota RV's kinda 1/2 a 1-ton version ... It would be worth removing the rear hub caps and checking for the full floating axle. a LOT of weight if its not.
What market place r u on still have it
I'll give ya 5k if you get it here to EU for me :D I love that thingy!
if you want to live the meth experience live in one of these
Should contact puddins fab shop and sell it to him
great little camper is it 4x4 i know some where
the red green quote was great
Between kevins friends and auto alex, idk who id want to hangout with more
Good 👍 job y'all you rock
Correct me if I'm wrong but the fuel pump on these trucks only run once they see a crank position sensor signal. These trucks don't prime the system when you turn the key on
Possum? WTF?😂😅
My dad had a 2004ish Chevy 3500 4x4 Double Cab 8’ bed Dually with the 8.1L and it got way better gas milage than a 2500 with a 6.0L.
Theres nothing better, then eating a roastet bear and flushing it down wih a nice cold Hotdog 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Awsome camper guys, love that movie and laugh a lot in this video, gold😅👏🎄🎅🍿🔥
Look at the European classic Camper scene, it's mostly First Gen FIAT Ducatos with 1.9 or 2,5 (Turbo-)Diesels Transverse FWD with a 5 Speed Manual on the Tree, 67 to 95hp. And if they run right, they aren't fast, but easily cruise at 75mph with 20mpg. They are definetly holding up with any American V8 Full Size Camper.  It's all down to the enormous Transmission and Drivetrain Losses that you simply don't have in a Manual Transverse FWD.
Amazing how clean everything is considering it sat in the woods for god knows how long……no mice or wild life nests either…..hmmmmmm
I love these little yotas.
Super fun and satisfying vid.  I've owned 3 different 1st gen 4Runners over the past 20 years - all with 22REI motors.  As many comments have said, it's a legendary engine.  The cab interior is remarkably good on your rig...
That possum will bite the hell out of you.they are nasty tempered creatures
Oh wow, my grandfather had one. In this type in 1983. He was in 63 years old then!
It will run even better after fixing that exhaust!
👍👍😎
When are you going to get back on Mook's stuff?
That little camper is in great shape
Should I be expecting to see this fine vehicle next week???  Better start now!  Fun video!  A+++++
where was this filmed? i recognise that camper and its paint patterns.
26:27 Paparazzi by Lady Gaga is a goated song lol 🐐 💯
I love that you guys quoted Red Green haha
where is Mook
Do you know Japanese? Cause I don't know English. 😂
Great little camper. Does what is was meant to do. Perfik.
More 80s Yotas content please sir!
I do sir thunk i lost the redneck test. cuddling a possum while drinking beer and cooking hot dogs. my hat is off to you sir.
Carhartt shirt.  Carhartt pants.  Carhartt socks.  Carhartt undies.
I do enjoy watching Kevin bringing all those cars back to life. But recently, I think this channel has given us a nice extra with all that comedy.
28:15 looked like Ezra was bringing a buddy a long, thought he was carrying another person beside him.
Is it still for sale? I want one of these things bad.
That intro in the beginning  😂
I see Ziebart rust protection plugs too!
so have you ever had opossum grits ?
Those are hard to find and sell really fast. One of the better engines period.
Seriously it’s a Toyota what we’re you expecting it to not turn key and go
Adapt a 2.7 from a later Tacoma. 159 HP stock
I want one of these!
its a toyota wat do yo think🚗
That truck is awesome! And the colour scheme is really, really good!
I sold these new back in the day. They were awesome
It’s Toyota! That’s why it’s awesome!
I appreciated the Sick Puppy 4x4 reference.
I love it. Asking price with opossum?
tell your gay friend BUNS are out 10 years ago...
It drives better because it is a Toyota.  35 years of driving AMC/Dodge/GM products, last 10 years Toyota's, won't go back
Beware of the rear axle
Average Midwest camping trip
I've put a like just for the possum. They are frens.
Hey on the old Toyotas you do actually adjust the idle with the screw on the throttle body! And on this one it is screwed almost all the way out which would cause crazy high idle. As I've fixed parts of my 22re over the last 2 years I've had to adjust the screw at different times to achieve proper idle rpms.
Shoot stick a manifold gasket at it and take it to your next track event.
At ten minutes in I was thinking maybe the oil pressure switch wire was loose. That used to kill the fuel pump and ignition on some of these 80s-90s models
Way back when those where new I was going to buy one to live in and travel, luckily I didn't, LOL
I need that camper
My grandpa owns one of these, be careful of mold in the ac and the front seats, we had black mold
Hey I know this isn't Your thing but You should go storm chasing for a video with someone because it would make for really good content looking at the surrounding and the animals in the area and capturing the tornado and meeting new friends along the way. Even if it was once, you would gain knowledge from this  and potentially learn how to act if you are in that kind of situation(ps I have been watching for over 4 years and discovered your channel 8 years ago and Im proud of what you are able to achieve and now I'm in the process of restoring a 74 nova hatchback! I'm 16 by the way)
A leaf blower has more horsepower lol
Great video once again. What happened to the farm with all the abandon vehicles? The one where you did the two square bodies
It shouldn't be a shock that Japanese engineering is leagues ahead of American engineering, especially back when this thing was made. That 4 banger probably has as much power as an American V8 of its time, just with considerably less torque. 😂
Wanna sell it?? I love this.
I lost it when Ezra reached up and snatched the smoke detector off the ceiling lol
In California, that’s a 2 bedroom condo!
12:12 no way! The fuel pump in my subaru did something like that, it was dead but when a trusted mechanic I know gave it power it suddenly revived and now it works. The japanese made cars that fix themselves if you give them a push.
Hey let's revive a Toyota == Shortest revival ever
I would put a 4.3 v6 in it
my like  dream rv how much? :D
The fuel pump won't work without the maf plugged in and air flowing through it. Pretty much anything with a flapper door afm works the same way.  Don't want the fuel pump dumping gas out in a wreck.
these are actually quite valuable. you should clean it up and sell it
if you plan to keep it, be on the lookout for a 1987 and up rear-end, the pre 87 ( 5lug) are a flange and dually adapter...tend to snap, the 87 and up ( 6 on 7.25 bolt) are a full floating rear axle.
Finally the video is here
35:43 the truck is like “it’s about time someone threw the book at you”
That….. was so entertaining 😂👌
I had one of these back in the early 80s brings back memories LOL it was a dog no power but it was a 5 speed and would only go about 55 mph going down hill but it ran well and ever thing worked .
They only came with a four-speed manual. I found myself always wanting a fifth gear. The problem is with the four cylinder there's no way it would stay in fifth gear
I like the no lines, bothered face  Mookeo 😂
My mom had one I took it camping to Letchworth.Wr had a ball but on the way home it would barely move. Ten mph home on the shoulder of the NYS THRUWAY.Took it to the dealer and all it needed was a fuel filter
That video title was SO close to being perfect.   Will this Old Camper RUN & Drive. Are We Out Of The Woods (Taylors Version).
Big fan frome pakistan❤❤
It’s a Toyota boys Reliable not an American made POs
Who else thought Greg was adorable?
❤toyota ❤
possums also keep other pesty critters away, like skunks!
I think that little R22E runs to a 1 ton dually axle.  That is why is rides better than the Chev campers.  That and no suspension or power.
i love my ridge wallet! i love old camper videos too :)
I never thought I would have ever seen Kevin stroking a possum
It’s a Toyota you will have no problem getting that back on the rd
By now It’s safe to say that Kevin’s spirit animal is a opossum 😂
I want to see more blanket races😂 28:30
Toyota never die cool find 😎
Oh, it's a Toyota Landcruiser. That's pretty neat
Nice rescue
Sickpuppies only said hydration session Red Green quote
My '77 Corolla 1600 had a 2TC engine.
That auto is in some ways a better option for something of that weight, the G52 five speed will blow top gear if using under load, I’ve killed a few in my time. That interior has been well protected by the camper body, real time capsule
Got to love that revers grounding Toyota was always known for,  I am glad I still have the 22R not the RE.
If a feller decided he didn't want the camper, he could just rip it off, do a cab swap, and put a flatbed on it. Then you have a dually Toyota pick em up truck.
YESSSSSS A TOYOTAAAAA THANK YOU
Thats literally a remake of trailerpark boys 😂😂😂😂❤
Do you know Japanese? I don’t know English…. 🤣
Where's Mook? I haven't seen her for a while.
Little bit of clean up on the interior and square away the vacuum leaks and a new thermostat for the furnace this would be a fun little rig. Definitely beats a tent. By Kevin taking the opossum off the tree does that mean he unofficially adopted it?
Yay he’s back!!!’n
It was a long time since I seen these on the road.
hope you do more videos fixing up this bute
always automatic nobody does manuel.
I still think you should gut the Poopmobile and turn it into a mobile workshop so you can drive to revivals with a full stock of tools and a bench to work on.
Man bun has gotta go.
Love the camper videos dude
Red Green is TRAGICALLY under appreciated in the states! ❤
1980s Toyota 22re WILL run yes. My Celica sat in a field in wisconsin for 12 years 200k on the clock and spark plug wires + a fuel pump made it run. It ate a chain guide and never skipped time and the cyl walls survived the metal shavings no problem. Theyre insane engines.
Put a 2JZ in it and send it 😂😂😂
Why do you need a magnifying glass when you have a camera on your iPhone
Swap out all your incandescent interior lights for LED for less drawon the system.
The dust pan tennis racket thing hahah
LS swap it.
great camper
A carbon monoxide detector might not be a bad idea.
Que camper tan bueno aun después de tantos años, se ve que lo cuidaron muy bien hasta que fue abandonado, como lo disfrutaría yo aquí
Is this still for sale?
Must say, I do love Ezras personality, brilliant addition to your adventures!
I had a 97 Hilux ute with same motor 22r but had a carburettor with an auto 😅 They are amazing little things. I miss mine dearly.
Remove that camper and you have a farm truck. Toyotas never die!...
I've seen a few of these campers in my life and they seem to run forever until someone parks it in their back yard!
awesome rig
I think  your selling  the wrong  camper I'd sell the other one and  keep the Toyota
It's a Toyota
can I beg you guys to get LAV mics? With those you can compress and turn down the engine and ambient sounds differentially than your voices, meaning we can actually hear you over the engines xD
Epic video!
Great video
I'd love to have that camper that's awesome
It works because it's a Toyota.
Kitty smells like cigarettes
Sweet Ride.
Factory stated towing capacity is zero on these rigs.
Haven't watched the video yet, but considering that its a Toyota, I'm 99% certain that it will run and drive.
When's the trip to astraya to do videos with cody and bam bam
Hydration session Australia 🇦🇺 ????
oh man I wish I wasn't broke. Saw one of these rigs done up all fancy like with a lift and some nice offroad tires, looked friggin incredible.
Always heard of Toyota's legendary engines. Had the pleasure of getting a 2003 Camry for my first car a couple years ago and don't see myself ever getting rid of it. I honestly love the thing to pieces. So happy to see this little truck come to life for another chapter in its existence!
Did you bring the kitty home with you?
You should keep it
Kevin don't need no cat he just finds a possum
Let's go to the races!
Was that a monty python reference @33:00 ???
no son we are not going to oregon.
That was great stuff boys! 😂😂😂
That's just cool
All mammals can get rabies, including, though rare, opossums. Also, the mouth being open is a defensive reaction to fear, so you are really torturing the animal by forcing it into a constant state of fear and not allowing it to escape.
I love a toyota. I've got a 1990 2wd Hilux with a petrol 2Y (1.8l) engine and a carb.  Great truck but the salted roads in England haven't been kind to the chassis.   It has a fast idle when you start it in cold weather. Manual says to flick the pedal after a minute and the idle will go back to normal.
Anti-theft devise. Just run a push button under the dash and attach it directly to the battery. What could happen with a short to the battery running the fuel pump?
Would that be considered the extended cab Toyota?!?  Lol!      Thanx !
damn. i would love to have this thing. but i life in europe. i might move next year to america. could i store it on ypur yard for that time?
I would keep the camper there so rare nowdays
Just a short one but what a find im sure yiy can fix it to sell     crack on
Cool little camper would be interesting to swap something like a 7m-gte or a 1uz into one of those
So all y'all did was a faith healing!  You too good!!!
Jesse, it’s cold. We have to fix the heater.
@junkyard digs how were the tater tots? I work at the plant that makes them 😂.
😅 100.000 Miles that's just getting broke in hell a timing chain adjustment and now she'll make some power😂
Something else sounds odd with the way it's running I am not so sure it's just vacuum leak.  I don't know my aunt's 85 2.4L 22R carb X Extra cab I had it at 75 mph on the freeway but it was a pickup.  22R carb 100hp range 22RE & EFI 110-118hp range
Up the hilux!
Kevin read up on how overbuilt the frames on those Toyota trucks are and you'll see why it is so rock solid compared to the poop mobile on the road
I'm looking forward to all the snarky comments from the "smart people" about Leptospirosis. 🤣
I had a late 1970's Mini Winnie. It had a carb and an automatic trans and I want to say it was only a 1.8 liter and it was so gutless. But as long as you weren't in a rush to get anywhere it was a great little camper. I had a lot of fun in it.
Of course it’s gonna run it’s a Toyota
Now I thought that it will be a repeat of the old $500 Camper poop mobile :) Still one of the funniest
Love Opossums, wish we had them here in Australia. Our brushtails are boring AF and are assholes 😂😂😂😂
So when can I buy it and come get it. Been looking for one a long time? I want to do Route 66 with it.
Been watching this for over 4 years, I gotta say, I like the sober content better than "drunk and silly" content. Sober up Kevin.
Wanna have blanket races? Yeah but on 3wheelers
Ezra would make quite an attractive woman...
I don't know about you guys, but I could totally see Puddins fab shop cruising this thing through pot county
Those little Toyota campers are awesome. Definitely a keeper...
Whenever i see a JYD or JYM upload I immediately stop what I am doing to watch :)   great video and ... i have to admit i didn't expect to see that possum clip lol
Too much weight for a four- banger to move at normal traffic flow. You'll get as many honking horns and middle fingers as those bicyclists and prius drivers.
I love your vids
This thing is so awesome
Ezra always brings a smile to my face. Seems like a great guy to have a beer with
My dad had a Mallard Camper and it had the same clock in the cabinet.  I believe it was and early 90's model camper.
That power converter in the back is what Luke Skywalker was going to pick up at Tosche Station.
That thing is in great shape! Fuqqin mint!
As an rv master technician, it makes me happy seeing you save this old piece of shit. It also makes me happy that you have at least some semblance of an idea of waht youre doing with the appliances and everything lol Good shit Kevin
Awesome video! I guess thats why people say toyotas are immortal. This rig might be a keeper, no?
Ahhh...I see you have a non professional Iowa carry permit as well!
the realisation when he drives it is fantastic , the reason the japanese took over the automotive world was because they made sure there products were at least as good as there compeditors so they would beat them on price or just better quality did the job
Time to put a turbo in it
They love to eat ticks
KEVIN,  DO NOT ......I REPEAT.....DO NOT , IN JUNKYARD DIGS FASHION , DESTROY THIS CAMPER..... TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THESE.. ..AND THIS MOTOR AND TRANS CAN BE MODIFIED FOR MORE POWER........   THANK YOU.....CONTACT ME IF YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE IT AWAY TO A SUBSCRIBER......
This video was definitely the funniest one yet
opossums in our country will take your hand off! 😆
You guys rock.  Takes my mind off my truck and issues. Always good to see you guys enjoy your adventures.  Ha
It’s a Toyota of course everything is gonna end up working lol
I owned an 83 Toyota Celica with fuel injection and a carbureted 85 pickup both with 22R engines. The only time one broke down was when the Celica broke a cam chain, a new cam chain and it ran like it was brand new. I owned the Celica for 10 yrs. and the truck for 15 yrs.
You and Ezra together always gives me a good laugh 😂
I vote to boost it until she blows 😂
I've always wanted one of those. I live up here in Idaho they're kind of hard to find. I'd really like one that's four-wheel drive. I think you should hang on to that and fix it up
I’d biy it in a heartbeat if you can help ship it to Norway, this is my dreamrig👍🏻❤️ Toyotalife👍🏻
LMFAO, the shifter's full.
Farmboys and yall ignore the number one rule of all outdoorsman 😔. You always carry a bic lighter even empty you can start a 🔥. Look it up.
That thing would be cool with a turbo
Thanks for naming the dog after me :')
22RE's have turbo kits available for non-turbo models...just saying...
that intro lol
Is this camper the Iowa section Possum Lodge?
Lol the drunk shenanigans at night is why I love the rural areas
34:50  Dirt dobber in the blower fan?
i think its amusing that kevin and most americans think its only 4 cylinders its underpowered , whereas in europe we look at the power output of our vehicals and know in general its american cars that r , especially in the 70s and 80s  when 5.7 trans ams could barely beat a mini in a race
Well The possum is the only critter that is backwards    In Australia possums are cute and wont kill you. For real wont kill you. Just about the only bloody thing that wont.  In the US possums are “What the actual Fuck” look like they will kill your dog and eat your cat?  What the hell. They must have got switched at creation or something!
ohhh what a nice small camper i hope you give it some love toyotas are beasts ive had 2 of them both coldstrated in -35c with no preheating..daily.. entire winters.for years..never had that happen with other brands
It's a toyota.. Of course it will run and drive out of the woods.
15on exhaust 12 or 13 on intake. Google it
Adjust valves
Where is this listed? I want to buy it
Awesome
Blood pressure lights on.....lmao
He told you radio was taken so wiring ish is wires under dadh. 💀💀💀
Those 22r and 22re motors were undestructable..net to the 3tc from Toyota  they were the shift...the 22r started in the early celica if i remember correctly. Strong and dependable...I can understand why they shoved it in that camper...
Yall should revive every old camper that would be cool to see different kinds of campers like this
Idle on a 22re is controlled by the coolant temp.  It will rev at around 1500-1700rpm until the engine starts to warm up.  It will also start surging if you run it low on coolant.
Man Kevin this is the nicest camper you’ve had on your channel. Why are you not keeping this and taking it the race track? Lol
Only thing that has bothered me is that a possum got to be on JYD before me. I'm not jealous...
You do answer your own questions. How can some one drive 100 000 miles with this? Now you know. There are more of these. Citroen c 15, volkswagen etc. Some company s made these home s that fit on pickups. They where within weight specs. Only thing the height makes them ,,wobly,,.
One of your best videos yet fun and entertaining!
When it is an oven with a stove top  it is a range.
That’s how Japanese cars are build!
Imagine somehow cramming a 4.7 i force into this
The fact that all the gas-powered propane fridge, stove, heater work makes the unit very usable, propane fridges are very efficient, and 4banger Toyota makes perfect.
Just an FYI, the AFM needs to see vacuum from the TB to switch the fuel pump on.  You can manually switch the pump on by manually opening the flapper door with the key on.
You've got ADD projects. Luke what happened to the dozen you haven't finished yet??
I tell you what I know who would buy that puddins fab shop on you tube he's the king of mini tucks
My dad hauled a 5th wheel in an 1982 Toyota pickup up to Alaska. Did it no problem. I now own the truck, 30 years later. Still runs great . 180k
Ezra you have a great mane!!  Let that bitch free every now and then in the films.
Also wanted to say it's funny how these campers can sit for a while but once you hook electric to them and play with them they usually seem to come around
I was stuck behind one of these on the highway just a 2 days ago, barely could do 50.  now im wandering, whats the chances?
Nice little camper,U-haul used to have Toyota trucks for moving they ran pretty well. I don't know what engine they had in them, but they were pretty good.Oh yeah,is Mook going to make any more videos about her Burnt Nova or not because it's been awhile since she's had a video out about it & her last video was 5 months ago about a  cutlass like the one that you gave your dad,so I hope that she has some more videos coming up soon about the burnt Nova or anything & I  hope that she makes you stand in the corner,Lol😅😂🤣,just kidding about that, let me know something okay, I would Appreciate it very much if you can okay thanks
That jumper wire is a normal Toyota thing my Supra has been like that for years lol
Kevin this is one fine Japanese made unit. Lol I can say that and be proud of half my heritage. Glad you got it running and driving again.
I live in Oregon...I think you SHOULD come here!  LOL!
when they have seen people go boom IT IS NOT A DEADPOOL movie shit goes you are covered I KNOW I spoke to a lot or squaddie's in the the suck got blowed up in a apc  flipped lost a buddy rolled on a building of worship found  30 40 burning you come back dead eyed took me three bottles o jacks finest and a fight to the death I won he were drunk more than me cause if he won't Id be deaded but I weight more and kissed his hurt away like a littlie brother should and made him laugh till  that shit was gone then I cried cuase he hurt more
If I want to look up that camper on marketplace how can I find your site
Didn't mean to hit you in the head with my wiener.  lmao
they make good little flatbed trucks if you pull the camper off and close off the back of the cab.
One of these sat in Fulton Illinois forever.  I think dirt reclaimed it after 40 years.
u haul's smallest box trucks used to be toyota based like the camper. they did the job just fine
For sale? How much lol
Take it to Alaska
Kevin, I'd keep it, maybe swap it to a manual, and possibly upgrade to the 22R-TE turbocharged engine.  If you do keep it and leave it as an  autotragic, then the overdrive solenoid on the left side of the transmssion goes out, buy one for a 1985 Volvo 240 with the Aw70 automatic.  Same part, but about half the cost.
kev how much do you want for it?
Toyota always works ❤
I have to be honest, until last year I did not know these type of campers existed, that said, this is not the first time I saw one, about a block up from where i live a guy acquired one earlier this year and it's been sitting ever since.
it was like 2 min after i wrote that the video said u check the switch was bad    but you can try to shift into neutral instead of park to see if it starts too
Dude they should totally put a JYD car in CSR 2 like the AMC or THE VAN lol
It's a Toyota. They'll run forever.
thats a sweet camper, i dont think it could work its way out of a wet paper sack but its super 80s haha. it did act very toyota like, you touched it and it decided alright ill work as they usually do...
hey kevin check the NEUTRAL safety switch since its a automatic to key start ????
Anyone else like counting how many times Kevin says ' Sucker ' 😁
I’d drive that camper around.
29:41, Kevin what you did is more Florida man than me.....and I AM A FLORIDA MAN!!!
The name I always heard those little toyota campers called was a Honey. I think they are neat.  Good job!
Wow that seems actually really nice. I don’t know how you find this stuff man you’re so lucky I swear😂
Pull 22re and transmission, sell for lots of $ and add a 4.3 with overdrive.
At 37:22, is that red #1 keychain on the dashboard a logo for R-Tours out of Eugene?
I’m calling it. This channel’s mascot needs to be a possum wearing a Busch light shirt.
I have an old chevy transvan that has been sitting for way too long that I need to rebuild (gutted interior)
Im totally gonna do all this looks so fun
going to NASCAR race camper ??
I need this camper, where's the link to market place
I posted this because i wanted to no body talk a bout war and what happens to the people coming home  wife's girlfriends moms dad excta  are going to get there boy / girls  back NO and I repeat FUCK NO you are FUCKED what you get back is a scared to shit version of your loved one what you do with is treat it like a abused cat or dog one that has been in crack house and had full beer cans lob at it they will want no one but mother every one will have to FUCK RIGHT OFF OUT OF IT they will need QUIET and the mother to tell them to get a bath NOT a shower a bath the pink smelly the better I AM not posting this cause I KNOW but hat i have heard and seen
omg that dvd visor is awesome
Man.. I’d love to have that! Cool as hell!
I am surprised at how surprised you are about how good a Toyota truck really is.
Toyota? Will it run?  ... of course it does.
I think your missing your key prime.
Wow rare to find I would keep if if possible
On Some of those toyota engines .  If the timing chain was sloppy it would wear a hole in the front cover.  Also some of the rear ends were 1/4 ton with simple clamp on duals and wore out wheel Bearings
22R(E) are one of the most indestructible engines created.  I had one in a 79 Celica I boutght for $50 w/ 402k miles.  One day I had a leaky radiator that sprayed over to the coil and killed the ignition every couple miles.  I pulled over about 5 times to dry things off and get back on the road before I decided to just drain the radiator and try to make it 5 miles home.  I made it 4.5ish and it just quit.  Temp gauge pegged, it was knockin like a diesel, floored doing about 3 mph, and i thought I drove it to its death.  I had towed home by a buddy and rode my bike to work for a couple weeks.  That sucked so I put a junkyard radiator in it, filled it up, 2 pumps of the gas and that thing fired up like it was 1979.  Drove it to 454k miles and sold it turn key for $400.  Oh what a feelin.
cant sleep yet new jyd vid dropped
He's explaining how the electrical works but you don't know what a cold start high idle is
I love when you have Ezra on!
That engine sounds like a herd of chipmunks munching on nuts lol
Can’t wait for y’all to go to Kansas City Speedway
35:40 Ezra  "moses" Kev, "it's the bible!"
hey @deadpun1776 English person speaking my forefather did not give a flying fuck  about you WE re to busy fighting ww1 and ww2 with the help of CANDA and every one else for 4 yrs before what they blew up your paradise Island  NOW do not get me wrong and I mean you slam me Now MY grand dad was a dessert rat in ww2 got shot in the head in battle and  marched 200 hundred men back to camp 300 mls because he was the only n c o left nearly got court marshaled cause some dick head amerian office told them to stay and fight to the last man against tanks that were rolling over dying men while he was having fresh brewed coffee well he snapped and punch said fuck wit in the face livid dick head screaming for the head of said grand father  gf sits down looks at monty and say I have a headache BOSS you got some morpheme then feinted never got a medal it just makes me sad for all those warriors now and then and what they when through and are still going through  we have to help them from the 30's 60's 70's 80's 90's 00's and further
Those 22fe engines are hemi head engines
Why didn't you check all the main fuses first since they're all missing
Its like a toyota  With another toyota ontop 😂😂
I remember seeing something kinda like this on marketplace, and thinking what the hell.
Mook sighting
Lots of opossums here!!! Had 10 little ones 2 yrs ago munching dwn some dry cat food and watermelons. Yeah opossums are pretty cool animals. I need a little RV like that. Great price on that one for  2,000.
Wow that possum was pretty chill.
I’d love to own one of them Toyota campers thst fella seems pretty good. Need lil love a it would be awesome
2:25 That mileage is nothing for how little that camper body probably weights. My Uncle owned a gas station/auto repair shop/uhaul rental facility from 1980-2016. Back in the 80s/90s these little trucks were the platform for 10' Uhaul's, ironically I learned a lot abut how to drive from moving these around the lot when I was 13 or 14 lol.
That's a great little camper especially with a full shower. Us taller folks would have an issue, but I've seen one with 400k on it, and it looked mint. I would love to throw that camper on my Tacoma.
Hilarious...the longer the video is the more hammered they got
28:18 why is Ezra's blanket wearing a g-string?
I wonder if Greg also lived in a barn find fiat
I was going to say more Toyota's please, but then I realized that might be really boring
I could live in one of those, I do night security so I'd park at work and live in it.
Dang to think i was going to bed, oh well time to watch the new video lol
Its the graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaandson of the fiat possum
As I drive my Toyota pickup to work today, I have never related so much to one of your videos! 🤣 the 22re really is a impressive unit. The timing guides are about to only thing that I’ve known to be an issue but once they’re replaced with newer style metal guides they’re solid. Would love to snatch this one up
It will run forever if its a Toyota
I had a 86 4x4 with that motor and I absolutely hated it. Yeah they are durable, but head gaskets and timing chains are commonly bad over 150,000 miles. It’s myth that they run forever. And they are dogs. Even worse is they put that motor into a Sports car which is the main reason I never bought a RWD Celica.
Man i love all your vids but the motorhome/camper vids are my fav.
If thats the timing chain that cover is cooked and can let water in teh oil
so happy you got your 2 week video out
With working horn and windshield wipers, you are in the lap of luxury.
I caught a possum about twice that size a few weeks ago and was just chillin with him petting it
Awesome Video..
Why is it so good?......It's an old Toyota!  They just don't care, damn near fix themselves and when you're only making about 50hp per liter nothing really wears out.
Wasnt there one of these Toyota campers on Top Gear or somewhere? Only other one I've ever seen.
I'm glad you found the appeal of these little guys. They're well made vehicles that are actually quite sought after. Thankfully not all your videos are Toyota related tho, or they would certainly be a lot shorter lol. Nice one, Kev and Ezra.
as someone with an 88 4 runner same engine trust me oil and power it will run till the rear main seal goes out and she will still run
Probably gets like 12gpm  Gallons per mile  😂😂
Awesome.  Those lil campers are nice
My first vehicle was a brand new 1986 Toyota pick up 22re carbureted 4 speed manual no ac no radio no carpet no passenger side mirror all for around 6 grand great little truck some of them came with efi in 86
I'm 6'4" I definitely ain't fitting
Best motor Toyota made!
I'm sure its been said. But on old toyotas the maf turns on the fuel pump. When the flap is open. I'm only 9 mins into the video. If you figure it out later in the video sorry for the stupid comment
And I believe that's a 1 ton chassis  likely fully boxed and that dif is good Size they are pretty heavy
Cool possum, not a big fan of the camper. Definitely needs a complete tuneup and maintenance service done. Not sure this camper is really intended for cross country excursions, especially in the mountains.
"What? It's fixed already?"  Yep. it's a Toyota.
From what I have seen, the 22re was prone to head issues. I had to replace one in the truck out front here, same engine.
This is literally my dream car!! I have been obsessed with these and it's many variations for like 10 years!!
Toyota? 22re? The new junkyard digs expansion pack is something else.
Those Toyota motorhomes are cool as crap.  Save that one, Kevin.
The v8s back then probably had about the same power to be honest
Awesome video
That motorhome is really pretty nice from the looks of it. There might be leaks we can’t see in the video, but from what we’ve seen, looks like it’s worth working on and fixing up.
Holy shit, that dog is me, wtf
V6 swap it
Does it have something to do with I'm watching this on my cell phone or did that sound like it had a little tiny mechanic in there with ball pein hammers pounding on the block
They were built for efficiency, and if anything, to show you didn't need a huge expensive motorhome.  I think though a lot of mechanics did say that the 4 cylinder (while more reliable) was underpowered compared to the V6 versions obviously.  I can't remember but it looks like that has dual rear wheels so that may have helped with handling, and the weight likely meant that as long as you didn't corner too hard or fast, it wouldn't sway plus the center of gravity is much lower on that, plus the over-cab bunk probably helps with putting some weight on the front.   Travel trailers, on the other hand, and larger RVs are less aerodynamic, higher off the ground usually, which is probably why you thought it would sway more.
If it is for sale let me know. these campers are awesome thanks for the revival!
It's a Toyota. Of course it'll run!!
I'd love to find one of these to cruise with the family. Mini truck + retro rv = awesomesauce
Most reliable trucks ever made. Loved this episode, i absolutely lost it at the opossum.
Well I was going to go to sleep but now not for another 41 minutes
Great video, as always, Kevin. Glad to have ordered a C10hhh shirt.
Bruh 27:53 had me dead 💀
I wanna see Mooks face when Kevin told her he caught a possum without her
Are we going to ignore how the Toyota got into your back yard in the first place ???
POSSUM CARE WAS CLASSIC.
That possum is so cute.  He is very gentle and love the pets.
is it just me or does ezra talk like an amish person? hes friggin hilarious; merry christmas, the shitters full! had me dyin', great vids keep em comin!
Id buy a ridge wallet if they weren't totally  overpriced. even on sale they are $70 at the very cheapest. If they reduced it down to like 40 ish that'd be about what its worth! I'm not spending 70-200 on a fancy money clip.
As an avid toyota fan, I need this camper in my life
29:04 BROOOOOOOO LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Moook would love him
The fuses under the hood.
Awesome video guys.  👍👍👍
That's a cool campin rig there. Just love the oddball stuff you find!
It's a Toyota, they are nearly impossible to kill.
Please make another video
We built a mud boat around a 22r, put a 65 mustang radiator on it. It was amazing!! Got us to many great duck hunts.
What a great starting point.
I bet you could probably pop the Lucas in the microwave (maybe not the kitchen one but a cheap spare) for 20-30 seconds n it'd pour out nice n quick. Just make sure you remove the foil seal.
I was just thinking last night it's been a while since Kevin uploaded
nothing can beat the 22R
How much are you asking for it?
Thank you good to hear from you. Hope your thanksgiving break was a happy time with family and friends.
Love my little beat up 93 toyota pickup I got for $2400. Needs a lot of work still but drives well.
Excellent video  Junkyard Digs Kevin   :) , Ersa :) yes those Toyota  pick up camper vechiles  are cool one school friend  of mine father has one it 1984 to and very dependentable  too ! He use 91 octane gas in his with 10w30 engine oil no synthetic type  and fuel tank only 25 gallon  one ! Yes those 4 cylinder  motor get 18 local and 35 highway mpg on fuel mileage  when tune up! Great camping machine also some are gas , Propane, Desiel motor  in yes there 4 speed Automatic transmission  and 4 or 5 speed Manual transmission floor shifter  and top speed 125 mph ! Rear end gears heard are 345 ratio!
I need that uncracked dashboard for my Dad's 86 Toyota. Wanna swap?
My old boss an 85 5 speed with 800,000 miles on it and we used is as a service truck for on and off road tires. service
Hey Kevin you should have a t-shirt made with a dopey looking you smiling holding a can of break cleaner standing in front of an old piece of junk car with the caption break cleaner does more than just clean break parts.
I would love to know what it's like racing a pair of three-wheelers at midnight while holding blankets and pillows after having consumed some quantity of teas.
This rig is in such a nice condition that it deserves a restoration. I own a 94 fiat ducato hobby camper which was rouch in electrical systems i janked it all out and fully rewired it. This deserves that as well
You know it gets saucy when Kevin just randomly pops in with a possum and is like he’s names Greg I found him on the tree
dude that is a sweet camper that gas stove is sick!
A 22RE with 100k? That thing ain’t even broke in yet.
What part of the country is that in? Sorry new to channel.
Yeah.. possums (opossums) will kill your cats. Plus side is they eat ticks. "Yep she's lit.." So are you. Now could you imagine that thing turbocharged? Judging by the kits available I think you could make your own kit using a factory Mini S turbocharger pretty easily, the big thing would be the Holley or HalTech ECU you'd need to control it and all the sensors and a scavenge pump.
I had one that did the same thing with the fuel pump  Ended up being there is a flapper in the air box that had to pull in with vacuum to turn the fuel pump on
I want that thing so bad
I need to know if the sun visor dvd player works lol
these RVs werent great when climbing hills and inclines due to the engines they had! Most ppl swap a V6 under the hood.
Kevin the broken air intake hose will set off the engine check light . To find trouble codes  look around the engine bay for a small grey box with diagnosis on the top. Unclip the lid and connect a wire between T1 and E1 this will make the eng check light on the dash flash. It also stop the ignition advance while connected so you can check the spark timing.. The flashes are coded. EG 1 flash a gap and 3 flashes then repeats or displays another code. That was code 13. Look up the codes on the net. Its a basic system. If you need to check the fuel pump relay its beside the computer either under the centre of the dash down low or behind the drivers kick panel .
It's a Toyota, you could drown it for 24 hours and it'd still start.
That was based on the Toyota 1 ton dually.  I wish they still made them, they were awesome trucks.  U-Haul used them for rentals, and the older ones were popular for service trucks.
These videos are easily my favorite.
So you watch Red Green too !
If it’s cold out most Toyotas will idle at 2000 rpm for a decent amount of time before idling down
Nice Intro.💩
I think the timing chain guides might have broke, and the chain is slapping against the block , for my toyota did the same thing.
It would be funny if you guys made a 80s era skit of a used car and camper salesman.
Very interesting 🤔 content. If you was many many miles closer to me I'd make a offer on that little camper. Thanks 👍 for sharing.
Gotta love old 22re toyotas.  My current daily is a 91 pickup (22re 5spd 4wd ext cab)   It was used as a trail truck for years and then parked for about 6 years.  Threw a battery in it and it fired up and ran beautifully. Had to replace fuel pump and then brake/suspension parts but its been the best truck I could ever want.
Toyota campers are the best. That one in that condition would sell for 5k.
I have wanted one of these campers for so damn long
One of my mom's friend has a group called the Red Hat Society and one of the members has a pet possum that she brings to all the meetings.
where was last weeks video ?... possum will eat your face....
maza nae aaia ji
I need more of Kevin fixing old Toyotas.
This is the definition of roughing it😂😂
Better with Ezra
Ezra hair is majestic
My Aunt and Uncle bought the Dolphin Model with Toyota drive train was reliable and did great for what they needed.
Those Possums will attack Chickens and known to eat Turkey eggs, not just bugs.
I'm pretty sure this is my favourite JYD vehicle thus far~
I’ve always liked these Toyota front end campers
Nice.
Let me know if you wanna sell that. I've always wanted a Toyota camper.
Camper for sale
I love 80s Toyota campers
How much do you want for it? I would buy it!
Toyota's are best! That thing seemed effortless for y'all to get it running. Impressive how everything still works. Well done guys.
“If your like me and busy as heck” as he’s out playing with junk campers lol 23:22
"Don't shoot possums, they're awesome"
I took one look at the thumbnail and went "Oh God, another camper...this is gonna be good."  Now I'm gonna watch the video.  😂  Edit: Just remembered this.  I'm taking classes to be a mechanic (getting REALLY TIRED of the MILLIONS of wires in the newer cars we learn on); early in the quarter some dude drove his little Toyota truck in and shook the rafters.  He Supra-swapped it 🤯
I started watching the video then seen Ezra's hat and was like now freaking way, I am out of town on a job for the same company. (Veit)
uhhh wtf? You just casually have a opossum that you found in the tree? That does not happen to sober people.
Absolutely love these Camper Revival videos!!
So great to see Ezra again!
I like it it's a Toyota will last a life time
Thats why Toyotas exist in the worlds worst conditions, they are cockroaches.
I don't know if it's a good or bad thing I had to like the video before the 4 second mark because that was hilarious
Most motor homes have an annoying exhaust leak.
That Ezra girl is absolutely hideous
In today's episode, we take you to Broke Truck Mountain. No cattle, only a handful of tools. They climb into this tightly spaced Toyota that smells a little musky but not quite a comfortable taco. Two boys, lovers, or just friends stay tuned to find out.
Greg 2 what's to bite you.
That thing is going to sell so damned fast. but I'm worried that sound was actually the dreaded timing chain eating through the timing cover (right behind the water pum as a bonus) that is so common on 22re engines
Drunk Kevin is best Kevin
Toyotas are tanks. thats a keeper. Put work into that and junk your chevys.
Ive always thought of these to be neat little setups
Wish I lived closer and had the money. What a gem. Awesome video
Now small block swap it😂.  I bet a 350 or 400 would make this thing feel powerful
Kevin should get a modern car and leave it in the woods for 20+ and fix it like a sort of time capsule
That Fire Alarm removal was too smooth.
That's quite a find
Pete's Palace....the best bunk in the North Woods.  You two are hilarious. More collabs, please!
I've always wanted one of those little Yota campers.
I love the very beginning where you said Merry Christmas the shitor is full if you don't know what that is from first of all you didn't have it a childhood and that is from Christmas vacation national lanpoons
29:50  was that an awesome possum video game reference? He kicked dr machino’s butt!
Ezra a great addition to the videos. He needs to be in more videos.
I'm still waiting on more content with that old Ford wagon, and a tooned shirt to match. An idea for it, a trail of oil behind it, or a trail of oil jugs behind it.
Good stuff kevin, i enjoy your trouble shooting style. Plus that campers in pretty good condition aside from wire mess under hood
3/4 ton chassis makes the difference. My plumber had a box truck like that and did 400k. Painlessly! Great constant
Ive been a die hard Toyota guy for 20+ years. We took my brother's 1985 4runner to emissions testing (thanks commiefornia) and his 22Re passed smog with a rod knock. He abused that motor for 2 more weeks before we pulled the motor and replaced it. He sold it to his buddy, he put bearings in it and the damn thing ran for another 3 years before it finally died.
Those are so great 👍
I must of been tripping but I swear I heard the pump
I’m impressed 😂Kevin always improving his goofiness
That’s a nice fuckin kitty!
Not sorry, not following limp wrist kwwp it up, loose another bud light ass hat.
It's good it was a camper. Revival videos on Honda and Toyota are called tiktoks or shorts.
Not only were those Toyota campers rad as hell, they were hella durable, as you clearly saw! Honestly, no surprises anywhere in this video, it's an old Toyota, and the the campers build around them were also well made. This one is a great example for being put out to pasture. Obviously, the axle was geared crazy high for all the extra weight, so the venerable 22RE handled it pretty well, considering they were already fairly torquey little suckers to begin with. Strip all the emissions crap out of it, give it a solid tuneup, and it will continue to run forever. It handles well because that Toyota """1 ton""" chassis was built well, and the whole thing has a crazy low center of gravity, despite the whole camper being added on top of it.
Bh humbug f Christmas
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING ONE OF THESE, FOR A LONG TIME.  ACTUALLY,  ONE WITH A 10FT ALUMINIUM BOX
How much do you want for that thing?
Are you taking this camper too a nascar race next year? Or buying another piece of crap camper to the races? Those are my favorite videos!
love to have this to continue to work on it problem I live in Washington State thanks for all of the Great videos keep them coming Kraig from Washington State
You found a possum? Mook's gona be jealous if you dont bring her one too.
Similar to the Chrysler's wildly popular hemi engine Toyota's 22re boasted an innovative swirl-inducing hemispherical combustion chamber. These engines featured efficient cross flow heads and long 3.5-inch strokes to produce impressive torque
I have a really awesome recipe for campfire possum 😋
You make a reference to the Red Green show.  HIlarious but the name of the lodge in the show is literally the Possum Lodge and you end up cudding one!
Had a really rough shitty and depressing day. Thank you Kevin and Esmeralda for allowing me to escape my head and laugh for a bit
LETS GO EZRA CLAP X2 👏👏
Toyota 22R-E is a legendary engine. If you fixed the exhaust leak it would run awesome. Had multiple Toyotas with a variation of this engine 18R, 20R and 22R-E all had well over 100,000 miles and were going strong. Usually the body would rust out before the engine gave a problem
More Ezra he’s hilarious
The Red Green Show reference is definitely underrated
Awesome video 👍🇺🇲🇺🇲
Quiet Iowa Night: Kevin: Petting a wild possum, named Greg, by a campfire
Good stuff Kevin... had me laughing, the best cut ever "WELCOME TO THE BLANKET RACES!"
Good god that intro!  1st, I love that movie.  2nd, when I was a child, I remember coming home from school to see my grandfather walking up the street to to our house with a five gallon bucket and wearing rubber gloves. I asked him what he was doing, and he said he was emptying the black tank.  I asked well what did you do with it? He said he poured it in a storm drain.  God I miss him.
The way he said Oregon so bad! 😂😂😂
Get exhaust leak fixed and timing chain replaced.  New heater thermostat replaced.  A real gem.
9:52, it sounds like a gas weed eater, probably the same amount of power as well, being a Toyota. 12:24, this is what you call Toyota things. No wonder why people love Toyota’s, they fix themselves while you sleep. 4 types of power, battery under the hood, house battery, shore power and most have generators. Also, in most RV’s and Campers, all the lights are DC, they use an AC to DC Inverter. When plugged in the inverter charges and battery under the hood and runs all of the lights.
If you want a manual, let me know
Gezz, that drive in the dark with ATVs is some BLAIR WITCH shit right there! lol
Lol carburator is sooo much better and EFI, EFI one of the quickest will it start and run cars you've done 😂
love the C1ohhhh shirt brother! almost wanna buy that camper from you.....😬
Opossums eating ticks is a myth
The toyOHHHHta
💥💥🛠️
These things are usually quite sought after. All the scammers have figured it out and list them for ridiculously low prices. I didn't care this was an easy fix. I most enjoyed the fun you two had.
I think Mook was wanting to adopt that big old dog... A St Bernard is what it looked like to me.
Oh boy a Toyota! 🤞
That engine noise is glorious! ❤ sounds like ITB’s 😂
It's your first revival on a Toyota 🎉
Take this to the dump. It’ll end up being a crack heads house…
That engine sounds like a weedeater or a chainsaw.
One of the best engines ever made
Hahaha "by the time you get em in your mouth their gunna be cold
I’ve done lots of camping and never have I seen tots on a campfire😂
31:14 I need to know how you fail that bad to face the couch the other way trying to fold it down.
Dude, I wanna pet a possum.  They always look super fucking angry.  I guess its resting bitch face
Those engines are basically indestructible in their stock form
Put a Toyota straight 6 in it and a taller gear. Off you go
Fuel injection?  My damn 90 or 91 was carbureted. And a lousy one at that!
Kevin, thank you for these videos. I swear you and Ezra are a wonderful combo. 3 wheelers, opossums and a janky old camper, thats whats it all about. Dont forget the beer! Keep up the good work, i look forward to your videos every week, cant get enough.
I dont know why your shocked you liked it Kevin..... Its a Toyota! There's a reason I sold my chevy and bought 6 toyota's this year. I did keep my cummins tho, as good as toyota trucks are they aint no tow pigs.
Or you could have just started it in neutral
I want that, your my favorite YouTuber btw
I loved the red green show
That interior is beautiful.  What a find.  It was well cared for.
was wondering how those drove nice!!
Hell yea Ezra
Yess another camper 💀💀 love these kinds of revivals 💙
I love the epiphany of when a non Toyota guy suddenly realizes why some people really like their Toyota's.    Shouldn't have a problem selling,  these have a cult following.
Cool video.  I save Opossums when they are in need.  :)  They are cool as shit!
My dad use to have a camper like this is it for sale junk yard digs
Your friends voice is almost more soothing than Bob Ross.
Good job 👏 👍 👌 🙌 😄 😅
Screw Camping THAT'S HOME IN THE MARXIST WONDERLAND OF OZ!!!
This is exactly what im looking for.
19:40 there is a light switch by the door so when you enter your RV in the dark, you don't have to fumble around to find the light on the ceiling. Most RVs will have this feature.
Just consider jumping the fuel pump as an " Anti Theft Device"
iirc the fuel pump runs of a contact in the MAF sensor, when the engine does the SUCC the pump goes
Loved this! I daily drive a 78 toyota pickup and I put around 10,000 miles a year on it. I would love to see you rescue an older toyota truck! They're pretty bulletproof and a lot of fun to mess around with off road.
MOOK !  @ 27:53 :-)
The toyota camper probably rides than the limo 😂
i own a 94 pickup with the same engine and it runs like a pos after doing the headgasket. like the fuel mix is all fucked, BANE OF MY EXISTANCE, because its my favorite vehicle
We need more videos of you fixing and making the camper nicer and better
Ezra is awesome.  Include him in every video.
I can see why not many toyotas are done for these will it run videos. It started and ran totally fine in the first 9 minutes of the vid lol
Honda kswap.
Campers, duct tape, opossums what else could you ask for.
sorry un sub you all weird beard knows why
Thanks for the video.
I’m loyal to Toyota lol just can’t kill them.
Lol the immortal 22re they are extremely unbreakeable
A 305/5-speed stick swap would get that thing cruising interstates too!
Greg!🐈‍⬛
I seen one just like this on marketplace I wanted to buy so bad
You should make that thing a pet 😂
How that little Hilux can drag that bigass Campersetup? Hiluxes seem to be stout af
You should do more on Toyotas and keep them
From the passenger side the intake looks like half a plenum from a tuned port 350 or 305... This theory makes that half a 3rd Gen Camaro 😉
That timing chain is loud.
Now, to drive this to BRISTOL for some Tom-Foolery!
What are you asking for it
we used to have one of those toyota campers. I think it was an '87 but i could be wrong. We had big intentions for it, but it ended up just sitting in the yard and rotting (the walls behind the cabinets were all rotting out. We sold it though for a bit more than we paid for it, and the person who got it was going to restore it, so that is good.
You should 1) keep it and 2) replace the timing chain. You can do the whole thing for $100 easy, and it will probably drastically improve the drive quality and resale value. Also, if I'm correctly remembering the fuse box from my '87, you are missing the fuel pump relay. Also, check the frame for rust before you try to sell it. Without frame rot, you might be looking at 3-5k for that thing.
Because it's a Toyota!! They never die.. and it's better then GM&Ford& Chrysler.. should take it too the races or you & Mook go on your honeymoon with it...
keven  ya have to have steve smith over to possum lodge for handsome and handy lessons  maybe a round of make him say this word. thanks for the videos
That Lucas oil and transmission are great products. By the way those little campers are pretty tough.
Drive it to Kansas City for the nascar race
SUM BISHHHHĤ
How much are you selling it for.
Cool episode Kevin, the RV looks like it is in pretty nice shape considering how old it is. It seems as though the little 4 banger and automatic moves it along pretty well.👌🤘👍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kevin holding a  possum had me dieing laughing.
sounds like a weed wacker
Send it to Los Angeles so a family of 6 can live in it!  Love the videos!  Way to go Ezra!
Plz more vids with Ezra! 😂
Nothing a L.S and a 480le won’t fix.
would u buy a 1970s ford f350
My aunt & uncle had one with the 6 cylinder in it... They lived in it & traveled from Arizona to scattered family on the east coast & deep south.. I rode in it from Tenn to the mtns of Arizone as a kid... It was a blast ... The bed over the cab with the big window out over the hood was a trip for a 10 yr old ... It was like a carnival ride... They drove it til it was slap worn out . It had 200k when the parked it.
How many teas did you have before you found Greg??
I laughed hard at the Bubbles "kitty" reference.
Without watching, I can tell this Toyota is going to run! I recently revived an 83 Celica Supra that was in a similar situation for a decade. Rats ate a ton of wires and ruined the interior but she's a wonderful running project now.
"It's like tv but live"
Theres one of these in my local junk yard, asked about it and apparently the 300,000 mile driveline ran and drove perfect but the frame was totally rotten. Someone pulled the driveline and the corpse of the camper is just sitting there. I bet that 22re is still running.
The heater is lit and so are you Kevin!
I have never in my life seen anything as ridiculous as a grown man grabbing a wild possum and cuddling it.😂😂
How much you asking for it. Looking for something to move my son and I into for awhile. Loosing our house.
Stop with the God damn brake cleaner use 2 smoke gas for the love of god
...."Sh*tter WAS full
It would probably be pretty sweet with a chevy small block and tyranny in should be this year's new Nascar trip rig
Ladies and gentleman Toyota
full red green experience. even got the Opossum!
Years ago i got one that had the truck frame and not the camper and put a flat bed on it. It was a good truck
as a proud owner of a 88 toyota camper with more miles than yours, 22re are indestructible and yes almost fun to drive.
I had a possum almost bite my finger off im not sure if i can say they're "friendly"...
That is the most chill opossum I've ever seen.
Turbo that bad boi, I’d crack up. Or nitrous lol
You know it's going to be a good video when Ezra's involved.
This thing is so good!
My neighbor has one of these and it looks brand new. Parks it in his paved driveway with wheel covers and tarp over the roof in the winters.
Wow, not a bad lil camper! Runs good the interior is actually in pretty good condition. Nice job totsie rotsie😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂!!!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Pro tip, use your phone for the magnify glass.  I've also noticed if you struggle with colors and if you're in bad lighting taking a picture with the phone or video makes the image 10x clearer
Putting a new timing chain set. oil pump and water pump and drive it another 150.000 to 200.000 miles and maybe just a timing chain set and done
You guys should more aften Japanese cars . I'm in Los Angeles they're all over.
It's a Toyota 22R of course it's going to run and drive out of there.  But I will watch to see. :-)
My parents had a used one of these when I was young, it went back and forth from DC to Florida multiple times and never had a single issue.
How much 👍
Did anyone else experience an insane amount of ads during this video??
Fuel pumps on the 22re engines don't come on until the vane air meter registers air coming through it. Another way to check the fuel pump is to take the air box and push the vane air door open with you hand
Nice I get to sit back with my few joints and watch this, perfect timing lol
Me: looks away to check on my dog  Kevin: here’s a possum  Me: what the actual fuck 🤣🤣🤣
13:31 Oh only a bible camp kid would make that joke! (BEEBlay or Bibb LEE depending on your flavor). What did you turn your back on THE LORD as a n adult now??!!! You know your Grandma's prayin for ya!! Just surrender!!
The possum 😂
Og digs fans🎉
Is this the first Toyota revival on the channel??? I'm all for it!
That's Toyota for you
Would this be the first non American vehicle in the channel, other than mopar since they are now italian
Possums eat wood ticks.
Have to say this somewhere, but why has the ads gotten LOUDER. Feckin' christ they will wake my neighbors up at this point.
Possums are my spirit animal.
OMG yes! Another video!! Where have you been my friend!!
Kevin thank you for your service man much love man u keep us laughing and tech us how to keep going ❤
I had a 93 Toy pickup with 22R carburetor ran like the Dickens spun crank bearing racing a Beamer downhill 😂
You know you drove that thing out there
Is Ezra a chick?  What’s up with the hair?  Weird.
"Just like this, that's it?".......yup, it's a Toyota. And just an FYI, you can make fun ALL YOU want but in the 80's those Toyota mini motorhomes, especially the Dolphin, were BY FAR the most popular motorhome model sold. If you don't believe me, compare a Dolphin on the market today with ANY other motorhome, in the same condition, from the 80's. You shouldn't poke fun at greatness.
Jyd when are you going to work on a impala hopefully a 1958-1970
Welcome to Old Toyota trucks guys, they're small, quirky, and weird. They're also majorly awesome. Really enjoyed the oppossum as well lmao, great video.
Seriously, is Ezra the funniest guy you know?
How much are you selling it for?
LETS GOOOOO BABE WAKE UP NEW JYD REVIVAL
My dad had this exact model. It was a total dog. 55 mph top speed on flats. Would take a half hour to get there too. It was a sweet little camper though.
Kevin man you’re a genius when it comes to anything with an engine !! I like Toyotas a lot please keep making these style vids !! I have a 2000 4Runner lifted 5 inches on 33s with 286k miles runs  like new !!!
My old neighbor had one of these that was turned into a flatbed it was so cool
JYD doing literally anything automotive related? Yes please
The old toyota small truck campers have a solid axle and break very often causing catastrophic damage locking up and rolling camper equals death, not a good idea.
God bless that campers soul. It didn't have mice and rats destroy it within a year of sitting untouched.❤
awesome red green reference (:
If i only new i could have been rescuing opossums instead  cats all these years.
Possum+kevin=possum cat and happy kevin😂
Puddin  needs that camper.
I would totally buy this!!! We just had to get rid of our Winnebago because we couldn't get it running and had lost our only place to store it.
The much coveted Toyota Dolphin.   I'd love to have one of these.
How’s the inside.  I need a place to live
I’d give it a good once over and drive it.
NASCAR season already? 😂. Thats when I’m used to seeing you work on campers. And you cuddling with a random possum 💀
NEXT DRAG RACE: camper vs go-kart
Toyotas will eventually just fix themselves
Yeah Toyota's there is Mortal as they come I have a 2006 4 cylinder one it has an high idle and then eventually it dies down after a couple of minutes
best motor ever made
You forgot to check the oil😢
22 r is the best 4 banger was the best
So jealous. Of course it will run its a yota
Would love to have one of those. I'm retired on limited income and would like to do some inexpressive traveling. My only question is I ride a Harley Heritage and would it pull a single bike trailer ( preferably Enclosed)
There's one of these listed on marketplace in arkansas for the last year, not running
Just asking why don’t you Mook finish your project’s that are in the shop like the Nova??????   I know you all won’t answer but just asking
Did the possum say, "Why did you harass my dad in the Fiat?"
I love how Kevin is an expert with campers know
Is it for sale is the real question 😜
I want that camper....
I absolutely love these videos, real content.
KEVIN, its a toyota!
Cold start injector is likely the issue with the initial start. 😊
I wonder if you can LS swap that Toyota I4?
On older EFI vehicles with a vane style mass air flow sensor they needed to see air flow through the vane sensor before it would trigger the fuel pump. That's why you weren't getting power to the pump simply turning key on you have to crank engine with VAF connected to intake and plugged in for the pump to kick on.
Mega classic toyota fan here: OF COURSE IT RUNS AND DRIVES ITS A YOTA BABY RAAAHHHHH
Finally a Toyota on the channel
what a friendly looking cat
The original timing chain guides for the 22r are plastic, and do stretch overtime, they do make metal replacements and duel row timing chain and gear upgrades
The 22re is an enigma of an engine it runs without complaint against all odds and only gets 2hp less than the 3vz v6 being the best engine for economy and hauling I've always been just as confused as you guys were
Kevin, you petting the possum was priceless.
We need a Greg the Opossum shirt
Most cause of the light is prob the smog in it same issue with mine so i just taken the light out of the dashboard
MURRAAY CHRYSLTER
So just buy Toyota Vehicles because they are immortal
100,000 miles on the clock? It's barely broken in!
I would love to have that camper.
if you cant get a 24r toyota running you may as well give up..a lot to do about nothing here
"Oh what a feeling to drive! TOY-OTA!" (I'm probably the only one old enough to remember that commercial) 😊
My dad had an '87 Toyota pickup from the mid-2000s to the mid-2010s. Good little shitbox but it loooved rust.
Camping
Junkyard camper is a good thing
Just remember an armadillo is a up armored possum.
One of the best series on YouTube. Y’all & pole barn are always the best…
You just have to hit a bump because when I was when my mom was driving you just hit a bump in the engine never go off or or you could just hit a tree cuz they almost said I'd treat it and you went right off so we don't know what happened never heard My dad even freaked out The angel I went off
Fuel injected 22re say no more even though it’s automatic rear gear the rear and to at least 4:10 and you will be surprised how well it goes
Damn, drunk Kevin with a possum is next level.
I just wanted to say I love your videos! Thank you for sending out the shirts with a little extra special gift with it. That made my day! Love you guys thanks again!
I like ole better than Ezra ! He’s cool .
IAs a Candian , i am impressed you used a Red Green reference correctly
Hit me up if you want to sell it!
That's a Possum?  Wow.....  I always thought Possums were flat animals that lived on country roads and wore their guts on the outside......
No spooning guys😅😅😅😅
What Toyota content can’t click fast enough !!!
Toyota was great back in the day then they turned to shit.
Opossum I only ever knew them as hissing snarling, ugly and toothy !
29:05 😭😭
Her name is Chitty-Chitty RV. So cool. Great episode! O u should  totally change the engine rev in ur opening to Citty-Chitties engine revs!!! LOL seriously please don't!
thanks
Brake light and battery light on is alternator issue usually but mine is a carburetor so idk about the efi
So, how much are you selling that $500 camper for? Cause I wanna buy from you for $499.99! Not a penny less nor a dime more. Oh, and could you do a complete detail to it before I pick it up please? I'll be going straight to camping in the backwoods of Montana in it and won't have time ta clean da bitch. Preciate Y'all!
Antitheft fuel pump
You bring that thing to Vancouver British Columbia Canada and you can get yourself 12 Grand easy. I wish I was kidding!
As a Canadian, I appreciate the Red Green reference.
I have an 87 pickup with an automatic its not great towing stuff but with the overdrive off it gets it done
Ooow, hotdogs and tater tots! Thanks for taking us camping!
Theres literally nothing better than a junkyard digs vid on an old toyota.
It's about damn time you make another video most of them make at least one video a week I like it when you and mook are together making a video
I was wondering what year is it
Word of advice ,never depend on anything that says ACME !  That sh.t never worked out well for the coyote  !!!😅
Way cool I like to go camping 😊 was fun thanks 👍😊
I used to have a 85 Toyota truck like this with a Sunraider camper on it. With a little 4 banger.
This thing is SUPER sweet, please make it nice.
Toyota lives forever
20r and 22r POWER! love these  motors so easy and reliable 😍
Priorities fix your camper crack open some beers a pet a opossum
Ezra is funny as crap!
Ezra with the perfectly timed beavis fire
"Why does this drive better than the Chevys"   uh, because it's a Toyota, lol.  They're awesome.
Seen the thumbnail and said out loud this is going to be good!!!!
The 22r is the Nokia of engines. ❤
omw to go get a opossum rq
35:00 the blower motor in my 97 Camry turned into a vibrator this season the dash shakes past 50% speed. Toyota makes sure their shit works no matter what.
Just in time, i was about to search your videos, but there you were on my main page. I hate security work.
I laughed so much on this video, then a lot of them. That is a good little camper, even surprise me. Thank you for sharing!
"I should probably start to slee..Hey! A new video!" 😁 😂 very good and fun episode, more please!
Convert it to manual you'll be much happier with it
Ezra literally offered to have Shreks with Kevin in the camper. Remember that. (Sorry English isn't my second language).
Daily Driver - as long as you don't go up hill.
Restore it!
This made my night. My dad said someone in our family had one of these. I wonder if Greg the Opossum is related or knows the Opossum you evicted from the Fiat😂
Man that RV is in great shape it’s a Yota with the 22re she’s a runner !
puddins fab shop ) would lose his mind for that one
Sounds like it needs the timing chain tensioner replaced (that tap tap tap) if it's not replaced when it starts making that noise it will eat a hole in the cover. Love to have one of these campers
Good Lord, that things on life-support😂
My dad used to own a 1980(?) toyota sunrader Exactly like this just worse, It had either the 20R or 22R and a 4 Speed Manual. He cut the Camper part off and turned it into a rad looking flatbed. without camper is still STRUGGLED to do 50.
Just discovered this channel yesterday. Needless to say I have watched about 8 hours since yesterday morning.. subscribed of course. amazing channel and very entertaining. From one Iowan to another, keep up the great work.
Happy holidays!
Just got the pleasure of teaching myself to use bondo to cover a couple of drilled holes in my front bumper
I want it
That camper is so minty I can smell it from here.
27:52 MOOOOOOOOK
Didn’t know this was the video I needed in my life lol. Awesome video!
my shitters full too thanks for the laugh jeff
Nice 3WC. Hope it's me! 😅
$4500 for something that you might of paid $800 for and literally did nothing to it. Hold on while i laugh 😂😂😂 you a scammer.
I’ll be honest I didn’t see the Segway to Kevin holding a possum coming
27:52  Mook is literally a floating head right there, straight up nightmare fuel
Your squirrel cage probably has mouse debris in it, that’s why it’s shaking so badly. Been there before
Will the Toyota camper be attending a Nascar event this coming year 🤔
very cool camper!!
28:52 Fits like a top! 😅
Merry Christmas the shitters full😂😂😂
If you're cold, they're cold. Bring them inside!
Oh yah, I love the videos with Ezera. Dont'cha know.
A lot of them campers have v6s in them them little Toyota campers they have four cylinders but they got six cylinders too V6
Drives great! In Iowa. Try a state with mountains 😂
4.3/4.8 swap it, would be a heck of a camper truck. Love those things. I bought a 72 g3500 camper for the drivetrain, sweet rig, but sadly the roof is trashed. She's destined for the scrapper now, but I really wouldn't mind something like this for easy family excursions.
I have never seen anyone just grab a possum off a tree and cuddle with it like a kitten..and it looked so excited ctfu
How much you asking? Been looking for one of these for years.
22REs are bulletproof
The possum thing was wild. Alcohol is a powerful drug.
We Toyota guys do love the 22R and 22RE.  Tough little engines.
Later that night they turn into foaming eye bleeding zombies after possum cuddling 😂
I’m pretty sure I saw this one on marketplace lol. Or there’s a second one rotting around.
Drunk Kevin is best Kevin
Should have bought a his and hers deodorant 😂
Long story short,a toyota is inmortal and wil never die😮😊 This is why this video is very short😂
Camper adventures and Ezra. Its a good day.
kevin almost smacked him in the head with both of his weiners.
Sounds like the SX has an air filter delete mod.
Hey a toyota! Love those old 22r trucks. Slow but go forever.
The air flow meter is at the end of the duct you removed from the throttle body. I'm sure you'd figured that by now. I want this motor home. Please have it delivered. LoL
How can I find you listening for it might like to buy it
Always great videos, thank you for the great content
Kevin I guess you can add possum whisperer to your resume. 🤣🤣 I actually had the opportunity to buy a camper very similar to the one in this video and after watching this I'm pretty much kicking myself for not doing that. 😬😬
I want to remember most of the switches and stuff in early toyotas ground things instead of power them. 22re is a great engine.
hes not friend!! :D
I have an 88 toyota 4x4 with the efi 4 cylinder and 5 speed.  What it lacks in top end, it will try to pull your house down the street in 2nd gear.  Fun little truck.  I actually pulled a Casita camper from denver to phoenix with it earlier this year.  Managed to do 35 mph over Raton pass and up Mt. Ord in Arizona.  Tough little bastard.
It sounds like a weedeater
The fact it's a yota makes it so much better
maybe you could do a V8 conversion and tranny upgrade. that would be funny and great at the same time
you should save this camper and restore it because almost everything you turned on  worked
Wow..I remember this guy😉
Possums also have dual tipped penises because the females have dual setups as well.
Every week you never disappoint how really dumb you are I love it
When your buddy stepped out of the camper, the next day, your eye contact was a little different hahahaha
Time for breaking bad camper in woods time cook some meth when YouTube doest work
Cool episode, that camper is really kind of cool.  I had it playing on one monitor, while trying to invoice customers on the other. Needless to say, I did not get any invoices done. LOL
Hey Kevin you need to do a trip in the camper it would be a sick video
I love the videos that turn into the Kevin Vlog
It’s a Toyota put a battery and gas in it it hit the key it will start
I was like fukk when I seen this because I had another video to watch but that can wait
Ezra is always fun to watch!!!! Thanks for including him on another camper will it run and drive adventure👍🏻 How much are you going to sell that little Dolphin for? I’d love to buy it🙂
Good video I can't believe that possum did not bite you
Once you get it started and running it may take a year or two to make it home.
You and possums. WTF?
Fuel pump relay is the metal cylinder under the fuse box lid on the passenger side fender well.
the maf sensor has a flap in it that closes the circuit for the fuel pump. So if that engine isn’t sucking any air your fuel pump ain’t pumping. Found that out myself a few years ago working on an old Toyota truck that had been sitting in a storage locker since 1997. Took me 3 days of stress to learn that.
Not your best work. Thanks for your time to make it
Gotta have the air flow monitor see g air come past it to make it run proper. It’s the module above the air box.
This was a different type of video I really that I am 6ft 3in tall I wouldn't fit to well in their.
how did i know this was gonna be on the next video? I was just walking my german shepherd and saw a toyota camper in my apartments like its broken down and I thought what if that had a revival done on it on lubetube? Bam I see this shit! its weird how that happens!
Great ! Sell it to me !
Well you equal about three of the normal sized people who invented that thing so for them it probably sleeps about six or so.😁
Started on the Nascar camper early
It has a 22R. It will live forever. '86 was the first year with plastic timing chain guides, so it would be best to do the metal guide swap if you want to keep it for long term. Sounds like chain slap to me.
Here I was thinking Kevin forgot about YouTube😂
How drunk do you have to be to hold a wild possum on camera like a kitten. Dude your probably insane
Fuel pump is triggered by the air flow meter, on top of the air box. It works with suction. If the intake tube is unhooked, it will not work.  You can jump the B+ and fp terminals to power the pump
If its a Toyota and it won't run....Its not a Toyota.👍
I'd be keeping that toyota and selling the GM junk lmao
Gotta love the camper videos
Please keep doing stuff with Ezra.
Those were good motors
The mighty 22R, can take all forms of abuse right up until catastrophic failure (and probably some more after that)
very noice
This is the most redneck episode bahahahahah Where is fucking polebarn garage when you need him
the engine will only run for a few second with the AFM disconnected because the COR allows power to the fuel pump during cranking (key in start position) and when the key is in the RUN position the AFM needs to be open (sucking air) to send power to the COR to run the Fuel Pump.  If the AFM is unhooked, then the engine will just run until the fuel supply provided during cranking is exhausted (couple of seconds)  In your case, with the fuel pump getting power from an independent source, none of that should be an issue.  The AFM does a couple other things as well, it primarily contains a potentiometer that measures physical air flow for the ECM as well as measuring the AIR TEMPERATURE, both of those things will help it run properly and are probably why it doesn't run well with the AFM disconnected.  So long as your fuel pump is set up completely independent of the old wiring circuit, then fuel delivery shouldn't be the issue. You may have a lean condition. common example is issues with the intake tube before the throttle body but after the AFM cracking or not sealing and letting in too much unmetered air.
I'm supposed to be sleeping but you had to post this video now.
I need that, drive it to Rapid City.
Funny thing about modern RV’s- they do not have inverters 😂
0 to 60 in a day!😅😅
Possums also glow pink under UV light
Are we going to ignore how Kevin just took a possum off a tree and treated it like a cat? That killed me.
Heck yea
Yesssss finally a Toyota….
It's a Toyota
Awesome video 👍👏
Few of these on marketplace in the Pittsburgh area.
Call Scotty! He'll buy it. LOL!
Points for the Red Green reference!!
Yesss! Been waiting for some fresh jyd!! +Ezra
Possum kingdom.....  That's the name of the RV
Opossum are nasty. They eat the inside of dead animals.
Kevin loosing weight!!??
0:00 gotta love the National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation reference! 😂
Just what u needed today y'all rock 🤘
I concur my friend.
Its Toyota so its just gonna run
Went from "Stop drooling on my chrome" to "I'm gonna cuddle you all night in our crap camper!" We love opossums here!
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Great video!!
22re is probably the best engine ever built
5 seconds in and Im belly laughing..
It's oregun  , not oregone. Wow.
I'm dead serious Kevin is that thing for sale I've been looking for one of those Toyota RVs longer than I can even remember
It's a Toyota that's why
22RE engines are really reliable, but under powered especially in that application.  Timing chain guides and noisy valves are the only issues I’ve experienced.
Great red green rewind.
Oh my god I want it. I saw a guy on Instagram with something like this, dumped on its nuts with 3 piece wheels. All white. Looked so sick.
Check the fusible link wires in the fuse box I had a 84 solica that somebody ripped the system out of it and it popped the fusible link wires
That thing most DEFINITELY needs a bumper sticker with the name "Stabbin Cabin" on the back.
another hilarious episode
NASCAR race? Eventually?
Fuel pump is active when air is being sucked past the MAF sensor.
22re are not immortal. ive own a RA65 Celica GT-S worst P.O.S. ive ever own. sold it for scrap metal after i blew up a headgasket the 2nd time. i would never own of those ever again! lots of issue unreliable junk. its the only time in my life i almost froze at -30°C waiting for the tow truck at 3AM.
Удивительно много места внутри. Классная машинка!👍👍👍
Let the shenanigans ensue
molesting that opossum was not what i expected to see
Nobody is Better Than Ezra
Toyota is the best always
“Can you read Japanese, I can’t English” 😂
These always pop head gaskets. Every time you went up to the mountains in the 90s and early 2000s, there would be a dolphin camper billowing white smoke out the exhaust strugling to do 35 mph with 20 cars behind it.
too small for jyd but just right for mrs. mook.
Never seen a Toyota on this channel that’s new what do you do to find these project vehicles and also how are you doing
Check out LC Engineering. They make a lot of performance parts for those engines.
I sawnone of these two days ago, and thought it would be cool to see a revival with one of those 2jz motors?
19:49
Bro, I am REALLY digging the bugshield and the wire plastic rims. DEFINITELY pimpacular!
can't see Ezra without thinking of his bubbles impersonation from TPB
The scene when he petted a possum.  😂😂😂
Best will it run a and drive channel onnnnnnn the interwebs..
junkyard digs maybe you should take the Toyota camper to the Kansas Speedway next year
That interior is really in good condition. This is overall a pretty dang nice example of one of these.
You've accrued quite a collection of campers.
Bro I would live in that thing. A 4 cylinder one bedroom apartment would be like what my dream retirement would be.
Some how I never get tired of crapy campers great content JYD 😁👍
Bout time they threw wrenches at an old Toyota truck
them toyota campers are getting pretty rare
Immediately clicked on the notification I love this channel and learning from ya man my favorite channel
Digs u always find the most interesting projects lol
I believe the fuel pump only works when the airflow meter moves and the ignition powered
These Toyota RVs are really climbing in desirability and price.
just got off work, right on time
My idle I hope I get to be like you when I’m an afult
Funny story, I have a 1986 Toyota pickup, it's a California edition extra cab 4x4, it has a 22re and a 5 speed, it only runs on 3 of the 4 cylinders, but I drive it down my driveway and through the woods at 30 mph in reverse, I just recently blew the head gasket but I will say that these trucks are indestructible
Yes yes yes yes yes yes. So glad you posted!
Love the videos they do inspire me I hope to do this stuff to one day
First 100 comments awesome
Going to be really honest here:  its shitty outside, i feel shitty inside, and this is exactly what i needed.   Im already feeling better 1:20 in.  “No fire? Well no electrical problems then!” And “we have a bible!” And its a chiltons.    😂😂
It always makes me incredibly happy when Kevin posts.
Within 20 minutes i got to comment😂😂😂😂
Don't you know... Toyota's fix themselves when they get love...  Those 22RE's are in 4Runners that will pretty much go anywhere.  My brother had an 87'.  -Another 6'2" Kevin.
Fun fact, that sun visor DVD player is like 125 dollars.
A new JYD video as I'm getting ready to eat some dinner, timing couldn't be better
Really like those good call. Kinda jealous
Mini truck mafia is starting Kevin
Yes it’s a Toyota!
Claim your here in an hour ticket her 👇🏼
OMG I LOVE THESE, i want one so bad!
Those old Toyotas are IMMORTAL
How was the video posted eight minutes ago and the videos 45 minutes long and it already has 2000 views?
Hi
used to have that same model. so slow
click, click click, click click click
8 minutes has to be a record for me
It's got a 22r it'll run
I have wanted one of these for 20 years. Love the 22re motor. Definitely underpowered for this application, but a bullet proof motor. I had one in my 86 4runner with 367,000 miles and it ran great.
Yayyy jyd camper video
72 comments in 5 mins lmao 🤣. I actually thought I might be first 😂
I just got my c10hh shirt and I love it. I wore it two days straight and I am planning on getting a sweatshirt soon.
When's Mook gonna finish the burnt Nova????
Deliverance ?
i love your vids but you should try finding a jeepster commando
Woot
So excited for another camper
Goddamn i should of been 1st comment started watching it on my tv 1st oh well lol Happy Holidays everyone
When I was in Boy Scouts, my friend's dad had a camper just like this.
Stupid sexy JYD! 🤘
Mint 👌
These are neat. Someone in my town has one sitting behind the house who also has or had a eagle. Also it would be a neat idea to do a revive revival like revive the eagle wagon you have by sticking a (modern) 4.0 engine in it
Ezera is back!!!
This is what I was missing out of my day
love it when i catch my favorite youtuber upload right as i reset the page
ANOTHER TRAILER VIDIO YESSSS
wheres MOOK !!!
Finally a new video! Love all the minty shit you guys do on the channel keep it up boys 🤘
I'm in Florida rn and I'm camping this is perfect lol I lover ur vids I'm from Michigan originally
first
Everytime I get the idea to chop off the camper shell and make a flatbed dually out of one of these, I remember Roadkill trying and failing to chop up that camper for the 454. Also, please for the love of god make a roadtrip wagon follow up vid!
Holy shit, I recognize a thay body style. My roommate had an almost identical one. Completely gutted and redone. They’re known for the septic tanks cracking and leaking rancid air into the cab. Also, those poor 22RE’s hauling that load |D
Ooh, cool!
Look what Top Gear did to one of these
Love the videos
Thanks for making the day just a tiny bit better, digs.
38th
I've always wanted one of these
