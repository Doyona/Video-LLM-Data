is this rizz
my favorite champion in the game, by far.
the new jinx? or... her nemesis?? fool V/S crazy?
The cleaning guy is the luckiest mf ever ong
I love my psycho little glutton ❤
after 2 years, still an underrated champ
When you're a monster but harmless to "Friend" and you scare everyone.... even friend... 😥 I felt that.
Epic. Friend....The only thing that stops the blood rage 😥
Two things:   First, Briar exploding out of her cell with a "NYAR!" sound is very silly and on-point for her personality.   Second, I paused the video just as hey eyes glowed pink in the darkness. Now, I'm in Mobile, so I get the option of "previous video", "pause/play", and "next video". Unfortunately, with the spacing of the "previous" and "next" buttons in tandem with the separation between Briar's eyes, I for a moment accidentally and very funnily have her the worst vision alignment of any champion in any trailer of LoL. It was a good chuckle.

Does the name of this video make anyone else hungry?
kawai
pretty delicious way to show violence! i like her
PLEASE BRIAR BE IN THE NOXUS SERIES BY FORTIIICHE
Tai Lung escape scene inspired and I love it.
PERIOD!!!
I hope she becomes a character in a spin off show
I love this champ
Delicious. 😋
ahhhh, the "feeding frenzy" reference.🗿🗿🗿🗿
Ah You must be another Vladimir's revolting experience
god im so jealous of that janitor
Close enough, Welcome back dead Isha
August definitely needs to be raided and checked. Bs champ that wins a duel with any other champ
I can fix her...
0:18
Some good bandage cosplay coming up
My ex looks like briar LMAO
0:35 Reminds me of Nimona hehe
Riot continuing to go after the lucrative I Can Fix Her Goonmarket
Hear me out..
feeding frenzy double frenzy tripple frenzy
Briar feet >>>
It kinda does look like vladimir's castle..
look like took her design from the anime Overlord.
bro she such a baddie 😭
she's so cute and funny  she can eat me
"I can fix her"
She’s like knuckles if jinx is sonic
Perfect gf doesnt exi--
omg its nimona🤯🤯🤯
Briar reminds me about Gyutaro from Demon Slayer
Just started this game and I'm already having Briar withdrawals because shes off rotation and I'm saving for Mel 🥲
The dynamic she could have with the janitor ought to be similar to Curious George and the Man in the Yellow Hat in the first animated movie where she keeps following him, curious about him and the world, and he is simply trying to get out of the situation.
I love this champ. Got with it from hardstock Iron 4 mostly 0 LP to higher silver within weeks
This is very similar to Tai Lung escape scene.
Are you TRYING to give me a heart attack? Thumbnail looks like evil Mylo
this was cool.
Here before they reveal Isha as Briar in a future arcane spinoff
A year later and this trailer is still giving "What if Arcane was also Nimona?"
Strangely reminds me of Nimona
jinx wipe love it
How dare they hurt escape buddy!
IT SHOULD’VE ME NOT HIM
Feels like they made her with Arcane spinoff in mind since the show left us hanging with so much mystery surrounding Black Rose and her release it's between Arcane 1 & 2.
SHE SO CUTE I LOVE HER
All the backseat is yours my lord 🙏
Genocidal Jack reference idk
Very nimona aesthetic
HEAR ME OUT
ISHA
Basically a Jinx and Warwick hybrid
Honestly she looks like mylo from arcane now that I think of it
She’s so Nimona coded
still would
SMASH
Smash
the first meeting between briar and the janitor makes me think of what happens when an extrovert meet an introvert for the first time.
nimona is that you honey
sup
Idk why but her in game walk kinda cute...
After watching Arcane Season 2 I have a huge coping mechanism that just like certain man got turned into Warwick, certain small girl got turned into Briar. 😂
It's not fortiche but another studio Brunch Eddy
Anyone else get fooled into thinking this was Fortiche and not Brunch?
Jinx's new friend😅
I would
I really hope she’s in the Noxus show
Guys I love her 🥹
They should've been a full time animation and music studio instead of a game developing company they're so good with these
Wonder if she'll be in the new league show
She’s like if you gave Jinx the powers of the Tasmanian Devil with vampire powers on top of it
Isha? 😅
Interesting how a champion, who is technically a child, has a "Mild Suggestive Themes" warning in her trailer.
When this trailer first came out I was rather new to League lore.   Felt bad for the guards until I learned they were from Noxus
I nust saw a theory that Isha becomes Briar, at first I was not sure but after seeing that she was a vampire which bit people to gain strength from their blood and how Isha bites ALOT plus the chance a Wild Rune was made from those three hex gems she had, not to mention how her personality is similar to Isha's hero, Jinx it's starting to see less unbelievable
So she a demon that goes crazy once she lose from her binds but the second they come back she gets a semi normal self
nimona????
Reminds me when I have too much coffee
it's been over a year and I'm still confused which body part the blackberry was supposed to represent...
Love how she uses her scream ability to end her frenzy early so she doesn’t accidentally kill her buddy, just like in the game
Briar and Jinx together would be total mayhem.
1:17
Who’s her voice actor it sounds like Kari Wahlgren
Ok can someone explain to me how she was in the sun at the head I mean she's a vampire right ???😅
Because the world can always use more manic pixie dream girls! ❤
The ping on guards😂😂😂
I'm glad non of you in the comments are on the lol lore team
Honestly, if LoL comes out with more shows (like Arcane), having one with Briar as one of the main characters would be fun… Her personality is equal parts sweet and TERRIFYING, so she’d a really fun protagonist I think!
stop my name i briar
Nimona vibes
Is this for the game or is this going to be in a series like a movie or something or the League of Legends show
She cute though
Seems like they stole inspiration from nimona
Briar mains here👇
I know nothing about LoL, I'm just here because I randomly stumbled upon a fanfiction about this beast girl and her escape buddy 🖤
You know what normally I saw smash but this violent cinnamon bun needs a hug and more friends
I have a feeling that Briar and Jinx would make great friends 😅 🩷💙
Why it has to be that guy? its supposed to be me!!
Feeding frenzy league if legends vs feeding frenzy warhammer
Im sorry but can only think two things "I can fix her" "Smash"
Wife.
Girls during “these days” be like
Fandom: Make a character crazier than Jinx. Creators: Say no more.
If the styles of Arcane and Nimona fused together, the only result is an absolute masterpiece! It's funny that Briar is extremely strong and dangerous but also, in my opinion, cute! 🤩  Amazing work, as always! Have a good day! 😊
Calling it, nimona would think briar is the coolest person alive
LET THE FANART/fanfiction BEGIN (Evil Laugh)
I can fix her
The animation is giving nimona vibes
What are those fire wing things on her back at 0:33 ?
0:58 THE PINGS ARE SUCH A GREAT TOUCH LMAOOO this is exactly how my team be when briar ult somebody
"But officer, she chasing me" "yes that's exactly why, now get in the car"
Collette from Brawl Stars 💀💀
I’d watch a show like that!!
Wish I could be that guy
Carol.
0:06 see i cant tell if this is the most replayed part of the video because it starts from the beginning of the cinematic, or its because its the scene where she licks her lips  personally, im in the latter category
I have a feeling that Briar and Jinx would be the best of friends.
Why does she sound like a jinx tho, any way love this camp.
Would.
Weirdo
Nom nom nom nom
Something, something, something, she wins!
She is so underrated.
She's cute. I can fix her
I feel like she has a bit of nimona in her and I love it
You know it grips
Oshiete oshiete yo sono shikumi wo...
Dhwoeuhdue
She wuld be great in arcane
I can fix her…
I dont fully understand.. what is briar.. is she human who just went mad or is she some type of vampire ?
Gives me nimona vibes
BROKEEN
How many frames are there in this animation?
Would.
All that Jinx was the crazy one good grief 😮
that Janitor bout to get the most dangerous head in all of runeterra
i love how she cares so much for someone she met legit 11 seconds ago
She can fix me
why do people hate this character? she seems rlly fun 😭
Can we get briar for wild rift pls ❤️
She looks very huggable
I can fix her guys
Love it
Cool hero, cool skills, cool story, cringe animation
Brair following the janitor around the world, I'd watch that anime.
*feeting frenzy
Omg Warwick they've turned you into an anime girl
Sick But Cool 🤟🔥
He came
If Valkyr and Nimona had an Arcane child.
The janitor is the personification of how every squishy feels against assassins
Parallel reality shalltear where Ainz locks her up for being too horny
1:15 briar can sit on me like that all day
Bootleg Nimona looking interesting.
This animation reminds me of Spider-Punk
Rule 34 artist: draw this down! Draw this down!
Would
I could fix her
:))
jinx but on meth
0:57 Bait ping. Congrats, you won't be unable to hear/see it.
The title is very accurate to in game briars.
"I can fix her"
I haven't played League in forever. When i came back, she was already out and i kept stomping her so badly as Yorick and was picked really rarely. am i assuming peoples doesnt like her?
Briar should be in Pentakill
oh nice gene simmons made it into league LMAO
MCR called, they want their Black Parade manager back.
God, I love that cold whisper at the end of the vid
feet
What animation app do you use?
Briar looks like Shalltear's Lamprey form from Overlord
i can fix her
Is this arcane?
the only thing i hated in the animation is that briar's lips were a little too thick
so she's half Nikocado Avocado, half Yandere Simulator?
I want the next season of arcane to happen in Noxus, just for Briar
Would
Briar is my Main 🎉🎉
hey look its shalltear
So this is basically Jinx X Warwick but inferior to both
Another pedobear dream lolly , cool, all these femboys so happy , YEY ANOTHER PINKY CHAMP YEEEY
I CAN FIX HER
Escape Buddy needs to be in the game with her somehow!
feet
Is Nimona. ....
Okay hear me out guys
would
Those restraints are freckin useless
This is basically Shalltear haha i like her
I hope she gets to be in arcane
Nobody shoves Escape Buddy and lives to tell about it. XD
Wtf is this? Where're the badass champs at?
Another crazy chick to add to the runeterra lore ... When are we getting a water elemental as a champion bruh ResidentSleepers
Nimona.
That's fun😂
Noxus is built different. (dubious morals)
This makes me want a new season of arcane
Man needs to chill, "Escape buddy" "That's my escape buddy and you're food!" I would understand real-quick that it was be escape buddy and actually escape or stop being alive. lol
Imagine if her and Jinx met they would be an awesome duo 😂 👏
She seem nice. Crazy, but nice.
OMG I LOVE HER  I'm a BIG FAN of characters whos theme is hunger or canibbalism, and she looks and acts so cool! :D  Happy to have made a jungler acc recenntly lol
After Watching  this Video i download  wild rift
SHE IS PERFECT I LIKE HER! (Main Fiora)
Feeding frenzy is an apt name for this title as that’s exactly what you’re going to be doing first timing Briar
Purple blood again. Thanks to east.
I can fix her
Jinx 2
Looks awesome. Makes me wish I still played the game… oh well! Still staying tuned for Arcane Season 2!!
She went on top of the first boy she sees, probably havent quench her thirst for a long time. That chicken is gonna get real wet
Nimona Vibes
yes doc this is my type of women
So basically Tai Lung escaping prison but change out the ducks feather for some blood and the duck being allowed to live for a janitor being allowed to live
Love the animation style
She's insane, i like her.
Yay, Jinx 2.0
Shalltear Bloodallen flashbacks :))
Ark door sound
Ainz: Shalltear, she stole your do! Shalltear: I'll kill her!
i like her
I feel 10% dumber, thank you
shes special and a cute vamp goth girl
Riot... please stop adding overpowered champs please
Make this cute girl looks so weird ,why？ Let me guess ,political correct again ？
morbius
Briar:And that kids, is how i met your father.  Escape Buddy: Yeah, and i still have nightmares about that day.😢
this is not cute or quirky she just killed like 15 innocent people
la de ponerle onda no se la saben?
this is just jinx but a vampire girl. like legit same trope personality.
Or her first 'accidental' conversion, like usually, she drains them dry, but this survivor for what reason became one because she stopped drinking him. Just cool boyfriend-girlfriend logic or brother-and-sister logic if you go the separated at birth route. Just food for thought..... mwahahaha
Kay so hear me out.... what if Briar had a brother or there was a boy that had the same experiments placed on him.
okie
I want Orphea! We have Orphea at home. Orphea at home:
feel like nimona
Good animation, uninspired writing. Basically vampire jinx. Can't fault them too much though I guess, they've got so maby champions that there is bound to be thematic overlap at this point.
It’s like Nimona but Firelight style and I am fucking loving it
The animation style reminds me of ATSV and Puss in boots:The last wish
Shaltear from OverLord 😮
Ah a crazy champion. haven't had one of those in a while.
Ya know, those teeth are scary, but her mouth sill has me thinking.....
I think she and Jinx would get along
1:14 *insert skull emojis* the lenght people go just to influence children's mind and attracts P into their works lmfao
Easily the worst cinematic in so long. Made a really cool design into something silly and goofy idk
43 seconds of my life that ill never get back. Another Comics cinematic, thanks alot riot
Twitter Finna have a field day
Wow so quirky, never seen that trope before.
briar and jinx....hmmmm
FINALLY A YANDERE, NOW I COULD GO BACK TO LEAGUE!
This character is definitely going to be as crazy and fun as Jinx.
nimona vibes
Well after coming back here after playing against this creature for a couple weeks I can officially say. Riot pulled out their good ol fashion autism once again. Never in my 10 plus years of playing this game have I seen a champion take so little brain power to play yet absolutely annihilate everything on the map. 50% increased healing, damage reduction lumped in with a knockback/stun that does way more damage then it should, movement speed, gap closer that stuns and breaks armor, and a global ult that's just a re-run of a vex ult. It's mind blowing to me that all I see every game that she is picked is everyone in the game complaining about how unplayable it is the face her. So congrats Riot. Not only have you done the classic re-skinned abilities on a different looking champion. You've also made one that takes so little IQ to play that you can literally press one button, take your hands off the keyboard, and kill everyone within a 2 mile radius of you. Hats off to you for doing gods work. Lets be honest I would say I'm surprised but with the track record you guys have I would be lying.
She and Jinx should team up.
"i can fix her"
i love this champion the lore the personallaty i really hop shes in arcane season 2 somwhere
this is every girl ever in a relationship when shes hungry.
THE PING NOISE 😂😂😂
Jinx + Briar = BFFS!!!
Riot, can you make more realistic champs again! and trailers pls
Nimona
EXTENDED VERSION OF THIS PLS
Animation team binged Tokyo Ghoul guess before this
i miss those days when riot actually made good budget cinematics
rule 43 is going to have fun with this..
Nerf it Rito idiots
Getting Tai Lung escape vibes
The ping sounds LOL
i love how they’re using the same theme and design as the Arcane series. That’s what prompted me to watch this lmao
idk but it's screaming nimona😂😂😂😂
Seems like Daughter of Alucard. Could be fun
Ah yes, a cinematic for *Female DIO*
literally obsessed with her (i have never played this game and i have no idea who she is)
Kinda sounds like jinx
Wtf man these people have some of the best animation.
Iam prolly one of 10 ppl but i dont like the animation style at all xd
can we talk about the most viewed part of this video?
How to not make a horror trailer by Riot ! Step 1 make blood, pink ! Step 2 censor gore with cartoon stuff or show grape fruit sliced. Step 3 Profit from kids ?!? Step 4 Be a wuss, and tremble at Youtube's rules.
She looks cool, makes me want to play.
wow another Riot stupid champion coming out
cringe for virgins
Not even goku pulling me out
Man, good animation is back in full swing, huh? Now we just need a tons of good writters and we're golden
Riot... Why do you keep making seemingly young girl characters? I'm not the one to play the oversexualized card. But for goodness sake she looks like she's 16, and she's in a bondage piece WTH
kidna giving me Shalltear Bloodfallen vibes.
i have one of this things irl
ok but.. this is giving nimona x arcane vibes!!!
Danger game MOBILE LEGEND BANG BANG copy again
It's giving Nimona vibes
imagine having a friend who will kill everyone but you
This is Jinx's new BFF
look like shalltear bloodfallen
I’m so sad;( I thought this was a movie
arcane animation style, I want jinx meet briar
I can fix her..
Is it weird that she reminds me of a hyena? 😭
First Jinx, now this one....yay.
wow very very nice
perfect cinematic, perfect theme, mechanics? not perfect in my opinion, i main ivern btw
faagh me.
Overlord writing their lawsuit for copyrights for Shelltear /s since it's 1:1 copy but without  👗
Cant wait tor ecape buddies champion release
Kinda got that KungFu Panda Tai Lung prison escape feel.
FIX THE CLIENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really hope she appears in Arcane
too bloody......
Nimona 2 looking crazy
Sounds like a vampire infected Jinx. Meh
Do I play league of legends? No, never. Will I watch every single cinematic you release? Yes, always.
That's exactly like my girlfriend as a champion. I'm the guy running.
She's the most interesting champ in SO long!
meh....
that was cool
Is she a cannibal? am I falling in love yet? I think I am...
Wait.... Is she wearing a pillory willingly? Does she want to control herself so much that she accepts that she has to wear it?
Jinx going to get a kick out of her!
Nice
Amazing Video Nice Content
HDVR
Nimona? Really?
📊📈⚖️📡🤖
again Riot making champs to make the pervs wet their pants. I am so sick of the anime looking characters in league of legens, i wants Cho Gaths, Renektons, Xeraths, not dolls or men like Action man like Sett o K'Sante
Cool......
I don't play league but I think she's neat😌
She sort of reminds me of nimona from Netflix!
If jinx got Reworked be like:
👣
Me like
We need her in arcane season two
I Can Fix Her
This champ is literally Shalltear Bloodfallen from the anime Overlord
Cartoon yang cukup menarik
RIOT can you please just put all the people who constantly spam surrender in their own little sandbox ranked mode, make it so that if someone surrenders they lose three times the elo points and if they continue to surrender they outright get banned from ranked mode.  I'm tired of carrying these absolute careless individuals who give up as soon as they get behind.
the artstyle is so ugly
HAHAHAH yall really thought you did something with this trailer lmao huh, yall thing you're the spiderman movie lmao
I think briar would have a good pairing with sett
OH MY GOSH! She is so GORGEOUS❤❤❤
Welcome everyone! If you like League of Legends Content I'm Doing and Trying my best posting regularly videos. If you visit thank you a lot means everything to me !
@LeagueofLegends Rengar Prestige/Legendary/Ultimate when?
Cute 🥰
We want league of legand in INDIA
Interesting :x
riot entertaiment company
I'm sorry, but your new champion is garbage. No offence
Arreglen el mmr.
I love this video,just wow
Skip
Those legs DAYUM
this game is dying
Cannibalism is so quirky and fun!
Her theme reminds me of the Batman Beyond theme and I love that.
Again a " cute anime girl"... Surprise surprise 😴... ... Where are my urgots, malphites and ugly monsters? -, -
Another lgqtbhtv hentai anime bs champ....
that was pretty sick, also a surprisingly horrifying design
Riot Games, after watching Nimona: "Okay, but what if she actually got to kill people?"
She’s literally me
The preview of her was like a horror, as it was with fiddlesticks, i was intrigued, then goes the trailer - totally opposite of what i expected. It was like "look guys, going berserk is so fun" with more like jinx vibe all over it. My disappointment was immeasurable, and my day was ruined.
I like seen
Very nice
A alguien más le recordo a Nimona?
Well, she looks fun
Ooh look...Shalltear Bloodfallen...
Nimona style's
cant wait for a moment when they decide to release champion with they/them pronouns .
Nice work
I was so excited to watch a League of Legends Cinematic... But they just keep getting worst and worst every year.. This one was super short compared to others. And I wont be adding this song to my spotify either... Stop trying to save so much money on these and produce better Annual Cinematics
Wonder if they’re going to make a series out of her too
A cannibal in a game.  Yikes.
I can fix her
getting Nimona vibes
I'm getting Nimona Vibes from this one 🔥 🔥 🔥
so its vampire jinx i love it
I can fix her
Woww i need a friend like that ! 😅
👍👍👍
She seems nice.
I like her already 💖💖💖💖
Nimona inspiration?
This is like a zombie... keep in mid this guys go with their agenda... to show you what would happen in real life. With people going frenzy and can't control their bodies and kill others... as amazon sayd in their delivery policy, in case of zombie invasion...
Yall I’m begging you to release an isolated version of the song from this PLEAAAAASEEEEEE
Awesome video. The real question is whether she's any good or not. I still remember the Jinx hype, lol.
Hold on they already did this one...twice. Sylas Jinx coming soon.
Is it bad that I want the guy to be her 'friend' because of this incident.
I'm getting a low-key Tokyo Ghoul-vibe
Wonderful. Another possibly busted champion.
Jinx: Relax, I'm not that crazy Riot: Ok, let's make someone who is, and also hungrier too
she looks like nimona
Add here to arcane please i love her already
Noxus land of broken champs :)
She wouldn't be a real threat to any innocent people as long as she can make her sanity return at will after the battle is over.
them punk rock vibes
idk why but this reminds me of Nimona but with an arcane twist to it
So, feral goblin child who actually wants to be something greater than what she was created to be?   I love her already.
Everyone mentioning Nimona, but if Briar is league’s Nimona, then who is league’s Ballister?
Why instead of releasing new champions, don't they fix the mmr thing?  I win a game + 17 pl.  I lose a game and they take -37 pl their game is tiring me, I feel cheated, no matter how much I want to advance I feel stagnant, I play mentally well and I think their rating system is unfair, for God's sake it's rubbish, until when are they going to Continue ignoring the community, everyone has the same complaint. Please, colleagues, give it a like and see if those from Ríot are moved even if they read it.

oh great another crazy chick in the roster of crazier champions 😅
Really wanna know the reactions from Kog'Maw (Hunger of the Void/mouth of the abyss) meets another hunger based champ like Briar
I want to see what the outcome will be for that guy and her or is he just a stepping stone for her to escape.😊
1:13 it should have been ME, not HIM!
this reminds me of shaltear ngl
So looks like a ww 2.0 and and eve
Basically nimona but blood crazed with apparently infinite hunger briars awesome
welcome to rule34 club
лдлд
ll
Mesmerizing. love this!
Wow very very amazing
she sounds like jinx.... at least hire a new voice actor......................................................
When Jinx was not crazy enough
Anyone else see this coward guy and want to see more of him?
so it’s basically nimona
I can see the resemblance of her and Nimona.
so we're just combining jinx and warwick?
Strong Nimona vibes
Ridiotcity at its best
Giga cringe, can we stop catering to 10 year olds and go back to old league where the characters are taken seriously ? thanks.
I love her
I Dont like it
she looks like a ripoff of Andariel from Diablo...
I will never play L o L but dam animaters just go crazy everytime
Please tell me that the Janitor sticks around. I love the idea of her constantly following him because she genuinelly thinks they are friends
Fruit ninja was popular years ago, smh... Jokes aside, looks pretty cool :D
Nimona energy.
She’s like Nimona but crazier and frenzied
Kolejna Żeńska postać psychopatki, jakie to prawdziwe.
Dang, Nimona really got messed up after her stint in prison.
Me encanta la forma ingeniosa de censurar el gore, pero que se entienda perfectamente que pasa
Ni siquiera la habían puesto en el juego y ya tuvieron que censurarla porque mostraba mucho los pies... En fin... Internet
i can fix her.
Nimona inspired. I don't know if it is a homage or if they were just lazy.
apaisio !!!
Anyone have the sources for the music? I can't seem to find anything.
nimona vibes
i seems like from all the promo done and the client music that this music won't be briar's theme. thats a freaking letdown because it slaps so hard
She’s basically Jinx’s cousin, except she has a boyfriend with her.
Totally Nimona in LOL
Well that’s one way to know not to mess with her friend 💀💀💀
Shell rebel against Nox when she met Sylas
I love how the animation changed its style when Briar unleashed her hunger. It's a nicely done detail.
Just like that I love her.
Oh dear god it's a vampire Jinx.
can’t wait for the community to be very normal about this champ
vampire jinx?!
powder 2.0
welcome back after 9000+ years
I know that animation takes waaaaay too long for this to have ‘copied’ Nimona, but there MUST have been cross-contamination, right?
C'mon guys....this is just an attempt to make another jinx Looks like nimona or whatnot
I feel like her and Jinx would be great friends.
Ummmmmmm Im staying far away from that person.  Teddy bears are more my Speed.  ^^
Reminds me of Nimona
I love this, Its like vampire tiny tina haha
I like the way she's saying "Hi"
PATAAAAAAAAAS
He came at the end 😂
Shalltear is that you?
Friend champion spotlight pls
you know its plasma pink
Huh cool. What's the issue? Twitter just being dumb? I understand
I would love to see her ik arcane
she is baby I must protect her
As rammus player another ez champ to fight
Disgusting combination of Jinx and Qiyana seasoned with Naafiri... Sad to see nothing new.. and league ruining itself more and more. Absolutely 0 apeal of a character... Absolute sadness beacause it reminds of a beauty of Arcane... which was so amazing... and now to see this trailer is like a joke on how long we should wait for another season. Only Arcane will give me calamity after such a horrible "new" champion. Even calling it a champion is a joke itself...
Where her feet at
this game is HORRIBLE
Totally didn't jack this character straight out of a recently popular animated movie. Riot would never steal IP.
Thumbs
THEY PULLED A NIMONA
reminds me of "Get Jinxed"
Good
Dayum she's so fine 😍Sorry Jinx i think i got a new girl lmao and it's perfect i can pick her and choose it for farm 💯
Nimona rip-off
is it just me or this video have a very Jinx / Nimona vibe to it?
Now we need team global ult. Jinx, Ashe, Pantheon, Fiddlesticks, etc. Enemy team is gonna cry lol
new character should be the janitor. he got the moves
I dont even play LoL but i do love these
Man, Nimona has seen bright days.
Nimona
i didnt hear the pings for the guards being alerted until just now, so did you. enjoy
where season 2
I can fix her.
reminded me of Arcane
nimona:
so.. crazy can get crazier
BRING BACK BAREFOOT
I’m getting some Nimona vibe 😅
Reminds me a lot of Nimona.
Dirk gently's Bart?
Needs more interactions
WHAT HAPPENED TO KDA
when you think this game cannot get any gayer...
👍
CZY TO FREDDY FAZBEAR?  AR AR, OU OU OU OUUU OU OŁ OŁ OŁ OŁŁŁ  AR AR Ar AR
i want her in WR so badddd!!! hahah
not to say that ennglish dub is bad but man the portuguese one gives briar so much more character
Uninspired design
She’s so much better than jinx
99,9% of the guys: I can fix her
_Certain_ members of the community will have a field day with this one, and i cant wait for it.
_wasn't that fun :B_
I’m getting Nimona vibes from the art style. Beautiful works from the animators
WHERE IS HELMET BRO?!
Can already find rule34 of her lol
Jinx but Vampire
Hey look it's Harley Quinn but a vampire. As opposed to Harley Quinn with a gun (jinx)
smash
i hope that janitor guy ends up getting dragged along by her
i just need one update from this game stop showings peoples rank in the start of the game. and stop out side apps to show our way of playing or match history  in the game .....
This is definitely JINX's sister right?
Jinx hit puberty , pog
Can’t wait for both versions of the theme to come out officially. I wanna hear this music
I need the music playing in the background ONLY and NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!4
Okay, just one question : WHAT THE FRIED DUCK IS SHE !?
This cinematic would be so epic if it was filmed like a movie (Rated R) and not this cartoon-style animation.
👀
Why Riot, Why?
What a disgusting crazy person
Oh no, I always knew Riot will turn the new Warwick into a friendly pink-haired femboy one day.
she escaped into the sunlight so i guess she dies?
Mini d4 Andariel.   Still not a fan.   Another superpowered 20 years old edgy woman. This is just uninteresting.
Giving Nemona vibes and im here for it
Respect the janitors! or Briar will eat you
Super❤❤❤
Please add this character in Arcane 🥹
Who's great idea was it to give her a cell.. WITH WINDOWS IN IT!?!?
So Jinx apparently decided to try PCP for the first time?
Seriously exceptional work! Love the design and execution.
He’s just like me fr fr (I came)
i know where this is going
why do i get jinx vibes from her
OH MY GOD, MY NEW FAVOURITE GREMLIN
I can hear thousand zipper
Another bloodlust champ I like it
Wow suddenly i remembering fruit ninja
Wow, that was AWESOME
She's officially one of my favorite characters of the franchise.
Ah. Yes. The newest vore champion. She's an undead monster who's perpectually starving.  So of course she's a young woman/child? With sharp teeth. At least she's not conventionally pretty.
Like how in game she got "fed" by you knocking on the door and she got you.
"I need my headpats, Onii-chan"
oh great another hyper mobile assassin with lifesteal that will be pick or ban for months
Aw, they made a new friend for Jinx!  Jinx: At last, a worthy opponent! Our shenanigans will be legendary!
feet
idk little weird they keep making these little girl champs....
I don’t know anything about LOL but this animatic has me excited for Arcane S2
the random flashing art style has to be inspired from nimona. thats not just me right. Even sorta felt like the time when nimona was helping the knight dude escape the castle? except in this in this scenario its based on a misunderstanding with a janitor
Riot should stop making games and just make animated shows, i feel like they would be better at it.
you have to find Jinx hurry up girl
Jinx and briar look like they would be great friends and would probably destroy the world together
Same vibe as when Tai Lung escaped the jail
She sound like jinx  In the most insane way 😅
Ah yes, another champ to make ADC a more useless role... just what we needed... not like its hard enough for us... add another assassin to the mix. Great.
This feels like the love child of Evelynn and Jinx
nice content
poor design, poor boring copy kit and nothing new, low as company it self
ONE OF BEST CINEMATICS AFTER FIDDLE REWORK
Lazy company. Lore>>>Animation.
Overly clingy, crazy and in restraints...   Oh boy *opens rule 34*
I swear riot got lazy and just combined Evelyn and Jinx
Vampire jinx for Dan Schneider mfkers... I miss monster/ugly champions...
rule34 gonna be crazy with this one yo
"Feeding Frenzy" is what happens after riot balances the champ reducing the 340 % ratio to a normal 60-120%.
Huh
demon slayer?? upper rank 6?
So now we got "tokyo ghoul-based" champion?
So Nimona coded heheheh VERY CUTEEEEEE~
Why does this cinematic look like she'd be a part of arcane
Cant wait for Nsfw artist to make Vore with her 💀
Bondage vampire, how original 😒 Wish yall would make original designs again. But the incels make you too much money
cringe
Ребенок Джинкс и Владимира 😅
The art direction reminds me so much of Nimona, even how Briar's written, so cute!
Nemona done right...😂😂😂
I can fix her
Good
Well she looks fun.
jinx 2.0
League of legends
Oh gr8 another high mobility 16 dashes champion. Cant wait to see how op the damage scaling is!
Big Nimona, first a movie, now champ in lol
riolu aweonao
Why do I have a feeling that briar is going to end up being a star guardian
let me guess, shes a lgbt as well?
wow very good
I always wondered what a vampire/demon with the personality of jinx would be like. It's perfection.
Great cinematography, champ is definitely interesting. I'm just not sure why all of the blood is portrayed pink, it makes this feel very sesame street.
Dude I would totally love Arkane season 2 to be about her and this janitor guy!
Jinx v2
Vampire jinx. Im game.
Nimona!
0:35 she literally got cooked XD
Blood champ back then: Vladimir. Now: Briar. I'd be disapponted if it didn't have at least 2 dashes though so it's fine.
Lol she looked like Shaltear from Overlord at first..
Nimona?
офигеть на русском озвучка лучше
Kinda getting nimona vibes from brair.
Briar just playing Fruit Ninja in her head.
Same voice actress from Jinx in Arcane?
Blender r34 artists hop to it
A vampire w powers that can go berserk 🥹🫶
I really really wish the focus on League Of Legends was to make it an eternal show using all of these characters with such animations quality like these cinematics and the actual show itself. Nothing against the game i just have no interest in it but these cinematics are always incredible
0:35 she literally got cooked XD
To me, Briar is like "Morbius," while Jinx is like "Harley Quinn."
Mfs on Runaterra really put some eldrich and powerful creature behind a wooden door and then get surprise when escape...
Shalltear Bloodfallen
Nice hoodoo
Mike: "I invoke the 5th." Internet: I invoke the 34th; 35th.
Yo am I weird or shes Hot
It gave me Arcane vibes
So basically, they added female lifestealer.
It's really similar with Tai Lung prison escape scene from Kungfu Panda
the arcane graphics in this video ouuuuu
니모나?
When my team feeds briar ends like this 🤣
Another anime girl. I'm happy to quit this game. now i'm on my way to play genshin impact
Most ugly looking champ up to date in League.
Nimona energy
Now, I think jinx finally gets a real friend
someone wacthed Nimona
Shalltear is that you
MASSIVE Nimona energy
Oh cute
SMAHS... uhh what
The ⚠ ping sound, cherry on top
You know, I just realized... Briar called the Janitor "Escape Buddy."  It makes me wonder: in the past, did she also have a Stick Buddy, or a Rock Buddy? Perhaps even a... Bubble Buddy? XD
what melissa in mobile legend doing here???
she's nimona coded
Another assassin?
It must be the lowest-budget cinematic ever made by Rito. The cut scenes are terrible and childish, the voice acting doesn't sound natural, and the music is terrible.
I wonder what happened to the janitor after this
bring back zzrot 40 arommer  40 magic resistant
Does anyone knows the name of the studio behind this animation? 😅
Bruh I would be her escape buddy
Can't wait to 0-12 this champ
R34 artist: 😏
Absolute W animation better than Pixar nowadays
New Jinx dropped.
And just like that I unlocked a new kink
Yall have completely run out of originality huh?
Ok now I want the gore version...
It’s giving nimona
gross, stop giving us disney remake champions
👍
Smash.
You must be very thankful about all this anime extravaganza, isn't it, riot?
Why they had to make vampire jinx, they could have gone with more dark theme(very very dark) rather than another goofy character
I wish I liked any of riots games because their animations are dope
Briar and Jinx are bffs and that's cannon
Arcane season 2 or 3?
vampire gawr gura
I CAN FIX HER
Cant show that in a Christian manga, buddy.
feet
Make zoe x me Canon
So, the new Jinx? Because you turned the old Jinx into a giant ball of depression.
Ooook...so Vampire Nimona with a personality similar to Tiny Tina....Cool!
I searched up feeding frenzy and i see an old fashioned fish eating game 😅😂 what has that to do with this character lawl
she reminds me of nimona
i love the arcane animation
where is Arcane 2 s ?
league of legend wild rift When will this champion be added? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Fish are friends, not food.. wait, wrong anime-- animation
duuude this gives me nimona vibesss
Girl's on period be like
Nimona vibe !
And now, ML saw this video and decided to revamp moskov.
Riot games really has no originality left in the company. Another rip of a preexisting character of another franchise. Tina from borderlands. Couldn't be more obvious where they ripped the idea for this one from.
bet this will become the most hated champion in the game 😂
I can fix her
Great champion but... They ripped off Nimona with the animation...
I think i found my new champion to main B)
I would totally watch a show of her like arcane
Add new 'FRAMES', level 750 , 1000. Add crown mastery(first place), CHALLENGES, display during match !!
Finally another demon comes after Fiddlesticks... here comes Demon of Frenzy
Strong Nimona vibes here
hot
She looks like a yassified Gollum
I like her vibes!
Jinx VA? Ella Purnell or Sarah Williams?
Why am I reminded of Nimona if she was just slightly more unhinged?
vampire jinx?
my new main
Reminds me of nimona but without the gore
Nimona is that U?
does she have the SAME, EXACT kit as NAFARI??? like fr riot?????
I can fix her.
A jinx mood <3
it's weird, but I'd lke her to be my wife 🥺🥺
Bro that’s literally vampire Jinx
1:09 it should have been me not him
Literally a copy paste from overlord in design, and yet another crazy broken copy and paste of champs that already exist for gameplay.
bet that guy can fix her
Love her design
I already want her to be the next story covered by arcane
🚨ARCANE  SEASON 2 NEWS!!! COMING WINTER 2024!🚨
gg nice china moment
That's definitely a reference of Shalltear from Overload.They both got a rampage mode.
She's just a silly fella doing goofy things 🥺🥺🥺
I can fix her.
Jinx 2.0
What happen to melissa mlbb?
Feeding Frenzy : Eat Fish Game 🗿🤔
Nimona vibes.
It should have been me not him.
Feet + Crazy + Vore  Well done Riot, very well done
cringe, how many times are they going to make jinx type crazy quirky girls
my mans busted a nut so hard he passed out
Pixar needs to take notes on animation
duuuuuuuuude this was awesome
Tai Lung's escape anyone?
This reminds me so much of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated!
Can't defend her from those artist
is it jst me or does she sound like jinx?
Nimona and puss and boots style inspiration
this style reminds me of Nimona so hard
Nimona who?
Wow, a female champion with a temporarily ugly face? That's new.
Please make it possible for players to play from other countries such as India. Forget about the play store. Even after installing the game we still can't play it.
Nimona? But cooler
She definitely makes me think of Nimona
amazing fight animation style!
dang- the way she speaks is just like jinx but more bloodthirsty (literally) 😂
I can definitely fix her 😁
Fantastic
Copy of nisha laby from elsword... yeah -___-, inspired...... i mean..., 80% inspired
She's so adorable ❤❤❤
It gives jinx but make it jungle and melee
she feels very reminiscent of Nimona
When is escape buddy getting added to league
IDK why people are so pissed about this character. I think its a pretty cool concept for a character introduction, the way she was either born or has a tragic background. I think she’s cool!
Anyone else thinks that she kinda have a similarity to Shalltear from Overlord?
Shalltear Bloodfallen
"I can fix her."
nimona???
Fix your game its to easy
wife material
It's funny how having her want to protect her "escape buddy" immediately makes her likeable. Silly human brain.
"we have Nimona at home" Nimona at home:
Wow the new character for rule34! Nice work, RIOT 👏
when everyone is manic pixie dreamgirl, no-one is manic pixie dreamgirl
oh look it is a redesigned jinx
I assume this is what every clingy girlfriend is like💀
shalltear from overlord
Her berserk form reminds of venom with the sharp teeth and the tongue   The animation was fire too!
Someone really like into the spiderverse in the LoL team.
Not the danger pings lmao
Excellent
Good video
A nimona- jynx vampire character and all the community cares about is her feet. Thats LOL.
Can't explain it but it but the art direction reminds me of nimona
I miss arcane..... Why don't you just.......
The fact that Briar is gonna get copied again by montoon makes my blood boil 😭
this girl is nimona but in LOL universeeeeee
whenn arcane s2 coming??
Why is riot so obsessive over little girl characters? Weird
Disgustingly cringe crazy rly how creativity is dead in this company
Didn’t we just get a stabby assassin champ….
1:10 god i wish that was me
Bro why are they keeping her behind such a normal looking cell with a reinforced Wooden door?
Her voice is just like jinx'a in Arcane
I swear briar and jinx. If she crazy in the head than she amazing in the bed. That's all I gotta say 🤷‍♂️
That sequence where her silhouette briefly resembles a bat as she leaps with the restraints turned daggers is so good
cringe
I can fix her.
I wish that was me
i hate the voice acting. Reminds me of one of the sisters from resident evil 8 when she says "fresh meat." bad voice acting.
Nimona ❤
Hey look its Nimoa
What? Where is the fish?
Rito is making trolling easier for trolls. Now they just need to click W and game will do the rest.
can she and mumu become besties?
God dammit Riot, are you trying to make me play this game again? I admit, its almost working.
What a childish game
I'm gonna main Briar.
Ok but bring back arena mode
Seems like riot is hiring mentally sick people
I love her
SOOOOO COOL
Nice
FEET
nimona is that yoou
They kept on complain how violent our trailers are.   Animators: Yes
Katarina+Jinx
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
wher feet
*F E E T*
Kinda looks like Tai Lung escaping Chorh-Gom
The animation seems familiar to me, it's like the movie I just watch its called Nimona.
would be nice if she followed that guy around
Actually first time I like champ skillset even if its beyond broken as it is in PBE, likely need way higher cd on her W or berserk should be less prolonged or less powerfull bcd she is just too strong if pressed, simply dominating everything 1v1 if you can't stomp her fast.   But I don't like art concept. Those shacles are simply too massive, should be something...less hanging and dominating whole look for a crazy/jovial type of character vibe.
Wow
Bring back old good cinematics
Nimona vibes, I love it!
While clearly not Jinx... gives off Jinx..
looks like Evelin has a new cousin
Nemona?
好酷
Too OP
Me: She's gonna say something edgy...  Briar: Hi 👋 😊  Me: Oh, a murder cupcake... glad to be wrong.
Ah so this is why we're getting season 2 Arcane in 2024, well played Rito
really cool champ!
Crazy like Jinx.Thats why i like.
Vander became a wolf and now powder is a vampire
so shalltear
it's like if nimona and genocide jack were fused.
So basically, mega lifesteal?
Soldier every time seeing new champions  -is time to go home
1:13 *IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME, NOT HIM!!*
It’s giving extra coo coo jinx
It would be awesome if this music played in the background when you kill 0:53
League nimona that's all I'm gonna say
Mommy. Sorry I meant mommy. Sorry I wanted to say mommy. Sorry what I actually meant was mommy.
she's f*king cute!!!
Nimona vibes
waiting on the rulebook of Le internet*
Geezus! Another insane character.
Nice
She looks like Nimonaaaaaa
she needs more food
e no balanceamento se garante ?
Would.
😮 The Comics Style on Cinematic
Actually he Jinx demons versions 😅
My mains in order: -Jinx -Vex ...thank you RIOT, for creating a combination of the two
She's weirdly adorable and wholesome.
Upload the full soundtrack!
Another "Meh" champ with a totally over the moon video.. Basic Rito brainworm.
in demacia we have helmet bro,now  in noxus we have the janitor guy
I think they would get along with Nimona
Gamehouse moment
the animation look alot from wild rift even thought is part of riot team
She sound like jinx
She reminds me of the witch from left 4 dead. Does anyone else get these vibes too?
So, basically a Jinx Vladimir?
Could you guys make item haste work on mobility boots?
So she is basically the child of Vladimir and Evelynn, raised by Jinx and Gnar? cool!
she has nomina's vibe and I liked it
wow nimona feels but a little more unhinged
So this is basically just a trailer where Briar is Tai-lung and the guy escaping is that goose
Well that slaps.
She is so cute
Okay, please add the janitor guy as a support champion. His abilities would include being fast, summoning guards, cleaning the lanes and if Briar is in his team she goes completely bananas if someone hits him.
Where's the briar's themeeee broooo
its warwick but appealing to pedophiles, love it.
Is this just nimona? But vampire ?
I can fix her
Riot has forgotten how to do monsters
I can fix her
Who cares? This is pay to win. If you dont donate they match you with absolute zero skill teamates. And they allow scripting in bronze and silver anyway... im pro level player and its absolute impossible to promote.
new waifu acquired
Riot designers: so Nimona but more edge??  Riot: yes
would
spiderverse art style nice
Meh
Lowkey reminds me of Nimona.
Epic
She need correction 😭😭😭😭😭💢💢💢💢💢💢😭😭💢💢💢💢
Now it's not exactly the same but the Animation is giving Arcane and I love it!
this is so me ngl
This is not the Feeding Frenzy that I know.
She transformed reminds me of those Brutalism style characters on phonk song covers
Shaltear bloodfallen?
RULE34
Its giving me Nimona vibes
I think we all need an escape buddy like Briar from time to time
I LOVE her design and how she just gies psycho mode.
Briar: Vex's Sister
I swear a woman designed this champ. Seriously why is she a loli?
She can make me worse
yeah id let Brair feed on me any time no cap og fr fr glizzy
Selena in ML vibes
Tailung Vibes
Oh man, TBSkyen is not going to be happy about this...
oh man, Feet AND Vore? I can't wait for the fanart XD
Basically a shark with those ugly teeth, and her face looks like it has less detail then all the other characters. This is just too cringey for me man.
Well hello new Jinx
Uhh... What was this kid's show? Where's my Warwick-like brutality? Where's the Aatrox and Rhaast-like slaughter? I'm usually head-over-heels for LoL cinematics, but this was way too timid...
who tf is this jinx wannabe
i feel Zero-2 vibes.
Why am I getting serious nimona vibes
Why did you do this to me
Can't wait for rumba.34 to show up 🗿🗿
He dead by snu snu
"i can fix her "
si si, muchos personajes nuevos, pero pocos arreglos y castigos a gente tramposa... ya he reportado 3 veces a una persona por uso de hacks, hice un video de ello y lo publiqué y ni caso, y, para colmo, ahora mismo en el juego estoy castigado porque el juego me bloqueó la pc, tuve que reiniciarla y me contaron como inactivo. Arreglen más, añadan menos, que hasta ahora sois bastante inútiles y no le hacen caso a la comunidad que les a dado de comer
Reminds me of Nimona.
It’s like a combination of Nimona, the comic-y art style of Spider-Man and fruit ninja.
Riot please!! its been 6 years since you released a good darkin champ! we dont want another quirky white girl with daddy issues again :(
nojo.
What in the Donganronpa did I just watch?
Shalltear in OverLord ?😂😅
rip escape buddy
Another one of these champs huh?
ironmouse multiverse
Honestly the first thing that came to mind involving Briar is Wendigol
This cinematic is cool, Love the new champion coming out even, but can we talk about the buff lux got? Why is CC becoming king instead of skill-based chess. it's just a game of who can make the other player stop playing first. I get it. But to the point where if I add up all the time I have been stunned in the game, its probably somewhere in the range of 300+ hours of CC, just waiting. I bet that time could be used honing my skills in a game where you CAN play 100% of the time. (face palm stun lock) P.S. -  I will quit forever if Lux gets another buff.
Cute <3
she is given off nimona vibes
I'm gonna say it.... I'm gonna do it...  . . . . Don't try to stop me . . . I can fix her
Need some more Arcane
Jinx from the Upside Down
"I can fix her."
jinx voice?
Don't even play league, but now I watch trailers to see how that person might play in Project L.
Riot saw nimona
Did Riot really spend all their time, money and effort to give Jinx a genuine friend?       Rule 34 is gonna have field day with this one...
Is this a we can fix her?
nimona meets into the spiderverse
PLEASE WE NEED ARENA 2X2X2 BACK
crazy in the head, crazy in the bed
we got jinx as a vampire.
Well mark me down as scared and horny
amazing as always but at this point it´s boring lol, should make movies
Briar enter the spiderverse.
Cringe
0:59 Did I hear the ping sound? It couldn't have just been me.
Every game ban till the nerf comes
Shes reminding me so much of Nimona lol
Nimona
makes me wish the game was as fun as this video
The f with her lips
I hope there a animation where she just summons the janitor just to hug and he’s in different states so like she just pulls him out of his daily tasks
This is giving so much Naomi wibes.
It's giving Nimona. Love it
her character reminds me of entrapta from she-ra abit, dunno probably just a little bit autistic undertones lol
Jinx but better you say, why don't mind if I do
Geez i wish i had a full version of her theme...
But why does she act like Jinx tho? Couldn't she have been a bit more mature and less annoying "uwu"?
Was this another Fortiche production? Really seems like it.
So Warwick spent a night with Tristana in jungle without using protection and now we get this ?
I’m in love
Homies heart stopped coz of the fear [redacted] Rest In Peace bro
so how you make this champion able to play in china? what is this champion and wtf is this cinematic anyway? is this some freaky anime scene? i miss the league of legends cinematics. I still remember the cinematic for ekko in good way and this is just blood sheet
0:08 this mouth sooo juice ❤
Can’t wait for the lore to be released. Hope the champion theme is just as awesome as this!😁😁
Feets
If the devs can't fix her, i will
so what is the amount of dash
Jaw been dropped for ten minutes str8
smash
New Jinx's bestie?😂😅
this gives me mad nimona vibes
Jinx 2.0
they really did their best to make this as cringe as possible, imagine if we got another fiddlesticks trailer instead we get this anime dogshit
YESS RIOT GAMES NIMONA
WOULD !
🤦🏽‍♂🤦🏽‍♂drugs
God, I wish she'd mount me like that
It would of been cool if she met someone who can infinitely regenerate and they go on adventures together.
Jinx, briar, vex and amumu should hang out together 😂
This would be so good as an actual tv show
Respect essential workers around Brair
It feels like they're trying to create another goofy jokey Jinx, but it comes off as cringy. Riot does horror way better and considering that this is some kind of psychopathic cannibal type character, horror would've been a better route.
I can fix her
Your feet
another cringe champ by riot, nice
Kind of reminds me of Nimona
Feeding frenzy is a demon now? I thought it was a fish 😂
Ew.
Game is dead af
Im not gonna lie, im disapointed. It's not that I don't like the animation, my problem is they teased that it would be a vampire. I was tired if hearing people saying Vladimir was a vampire while he is not but he will still be the closest thing we will ever get from a vampire. Im sorry but she is no true vampire, she is just cannibal Jinx...
If Gen Z was a champ
I really want to see more of her in cinematic versions. like in Arcane for expample! because that WAS fun...
Smash
oh we have an even crazier and cooler version of powder
Briar looks awesome, she really stands out in her own way amongst the rest of the characters
her frenzy form reminds me of Shalltears bloodlust form from Overlord
pls have the mercy Reddit r/34, but fr tho whats her lore
Voiced by jinx i see😂😂😂😂 when does she hit wild rift
lucky guy I say. She pays for her own food is instantly loyal, and is literally riding you within the first minute.
CORONA TIMEEEEEEEEEEEEE~~~
amumu here is your chance for a friend
I first time played lol in my pc day before yesterday and when i clicked that warning menu she came out and she creeped me out with the hungry stuff and friends stuff i thought this was normal in lol and i thought this was a story line , funny i got bullied heavily by an intermediate mid lane bots 🥲🥲 i would other way if it was in mobile tho the game was good
She's precious
Idk man, at the same time that I loved the design of this character, I HATED how it looks
Her personality its basically nimona
jinx from noxus
0:36 I hope that's her theme song
What a waste of potential, if only they have some dark champions with brutality would be great but unfortunately we are living in 2023 which brutality and blood is pink colors …..
*feet*
Bit of jinx in there but she 100 potraying nimona energy
Atleast She's Honest to Friend :)
I know this game is for various ages but I still wish to see more blood and gore
Kind of scary but still love this, can't wait to see this champion in official fights at LCK, LPL,VCS, LEC, etc. or Worlds haha
That was awesome. I love the style to hide the gore. Looked awesome :)
i love her
shalltear is that you?
yeaaaah another cringe jinx/harley queen like character
Gives off Shrek vibes
Some of you finding her hot... yet shes like a 5 year old girl... sick
I get the feeling she and Jinx would get along pretty well!
WHAT'S THE SONG I NEED THE SONG
"You are my frien now."
Wasn't that fun? 😂😂😂
I don't know why but i hear a bit of mileena from this character...
it's sluuuuuurp time
League needs to chill with the crazy chick kinks
Perdoname por todo leacue of legends
Collabo with fruit ninja?
Where is the fish?
Expectation - A manic vampire child beast wreaks havoc in her breakout, Nimona-style.  Reality - A prison janitor meets his girlfriend.
I can already tell she's gonna be amazing, and that animation was just everything!! She's kinda reminding me of Nimona.
At first I thought this was a little boy character, and I'm honestly pretty disappointed it isnt. Imagine how creepy it would be if a little boy ran around and ate people. 🙊  But I guess this is just Jinx 2, but mpee homicidal.
Oh Briar is def gonna hit it off with Vex 🧛‍♀️👩‍🎤
Rule 34 will have a field day with this
I imagine this will be fun against Master Yi
Smash, next
kinda reminds me of Nimona
shalltear bloodfallen from overlord
I can fix her
they got steel against magic dawg LMAOOO
If anything else gets leaked, I hope it's the full version of the Theme song.
Jinx 2.0
She looks like Powder ,isn't she? Take a look at here? 1:20
I can fix her
jinx？
smash, definitely smash... no questions asked
Is this another jinx charater Eww
Nimona just did too well huh
0:36 they really only gave her a helmet where the eyes are visible just to see her expression when she was getting cooked xd
Nimona vibes
She looks like shelter blood fallen from over lord
This Scuffed Qiyana scares me!! lmao
Best thing Ive seen from Riot since Arcane hands down
Sion 2.0 ?
"No definitely giving undead for sure, you reek."
jinx but in a slightly pedo bai form, how wonderfull! (ATENTION: This comment contains IRONY/SARCASM)
This feeding frenzy is insane. Briar gives you that feeling you couldn't easily get rid off your chest. It just stays with you for an explicably long time.
The medieval village of Chillingbourne would have made an amazing backdrop.
Nimona with the arcane animation style is really doing it for me, i love this so much.
The champion that gives AUTO attack  its definition
Amazing
I can’t believe I finally have some common ground to stand on with modern Sonic fans. I disowned you all in my 20s & now that I’m almost 40… I understand you brothers, I understand you. 👁️ 👃 👁️ 👣 Praise be Prophetic Great One Tarantino!
If this is a support im gonna cream
I like to think that the janitor just gets dragged along with Briar. And she wouldn't even be threatening him she would just be very insistent. He just doesn't get paid enough to say no.
woah they added Shalltear Bloodfallen from overlord
This character looks like the vampire girl in the overlord. Shalltear bloodfallen.
you really just add nimona to lol huh
stupid movie
Soooooo does this mean a new friend fro jinx in season 2 of arcane?! please
I think she, Rell, and Jinx would all get along.
Jinx bff
Well hello there, Lisa Trevor.
...Nimona?
Anyone ever notice the same pronouns being used between League and destiny 2. Like briar briars contempt and feeding frenzy, there’s been others I’ve noticed too I just can’t remember at the moment.
Voice sounded like jinx, and even how she phrases things sound like jinx
Great another losescrews added to the list.
Keep the friend in the lore with this character Riot Games.
she's like nimona
Well, escape buddy in fact did know the way out
i can fix her
Goblin mode activated!
If she teams up with Brand it can be Shark Girl and Lava Boy
She's basically Shalltear Bloodfallen from Overlord who goes berserk when she gets enough blood. Her hair, appearance and transformation resembles her! Thanks riot!!
Briar is the deastatetor women? I had a dream that there was a woman and i was a prisoner and i guess i killed the king? I can't remember but i wrote it down though. But anyhow i was in the tower with the deavastetor woman and there were traps and we were heading down the tower and there were 2 additional prisoners like zombie's and they were trying to stop us but. No i can't remember how my dream went. Im sorry that i cannot remember.
Riot teaming up with fortiche was literally like Kobe and shaq. I’ve never seen a miss from the two of them together
Shalltear Bloodfallen in league of legends
Can't wait for more of her lore. She has some great potential to it
wait a sec, isn't it her frenzy gonna stop if she scream?
That's jinx BFF
...I like her!
So riot just made shaltear from overlord
i need me a loyal femboy like her
Nimona goes hard
What if Jinx was a vampire? ;)
where is the dragon warrior
So.. Jinx 2.0 Electric Boogaloo?
Would.
Spider punk
the guards got question mark pinged
I’m the only who instantly thought nimona 😭definitely giving that
Vex : why do you this to me riooot? They all will forget my R ability Crying in the corner😅
it's giving selena
i can fix her
Reminds me so much of tai lung escaping in kungfu panda
No disrespect to the voice actor but riot, you should’ve take the step to keeping the “scary” theme of the champs design. Again lots of potential to be something much more amazing and just gets half-assed with the little things
That ping sound when she proceed to full clear the minion 🗿
🦶🦶🦶
😭
jinx without a gun
1:23 awesome
Flandre? Is that you?
Riot couldn’t make a horror to save their life so idk why some people expected horror
Apparently her who thing is not wanting to lose control of herself this trailer does not do that justice all we learn is that she is dangerous. I mean it would have been better if the dude let her out because she asked him to and tried to help her escape but they get caught guards start beating on him. She begs them to stop and she will go back if they do but they don’t leaving her no choice she kicks away the jewel in her bindings keeping her sane and she kills them all. After wards she is horrified by what she has done that would have been better to fit the fear of losing control of herself riot said they were going for
Jinx got a new friend. Cray cray friend.
So.. is she a vampire? I mean a real vampire this time?
Vampire JInx
Another Darkin?
looks cringe
the music sound like the intro of batman beyond, thats cool
I feel,something of a SPIDER-PUNK,vibe,with the animation,AND the character all together.
Please be for worlds 2024 🤗🤗
step 1 to counter frenzy : dont fed her step 2 if step 1 did not work : report jg, uninstall game
I just watched this and I'm already in love with her. The animation of the trailer alone was so good and vibrant. I can't wait to play her
Are we getting a new champion? I could’ve sworn we recently just got one a few weeks ago
Baiting. No
This cinematic proves (IMO) that when she is in Berserker mode she will attack Allies and Enemies. I think this makes sense since Renata’s ultimate put the “berserker” on top of the enemy team and they attack each other.
oh well, now I want escape-buddy in the game too
what's is this, jinx blood/vampire? what's wrong, riot? that's amazing!
Dude looks like shalltear from overlord
I checked the lore etc and i can only say that's she was a very well done character
Guys, I’m horny
Lol fans:New word: Pillory  Meanwhile Destiny lore enthusiasts: Oh god THEY HUMANISED SOLTERIA.
this is so cute and horrific at the same time.
Can’t wait for this champ to nerfed to the ground and not picked at all only my otps
the music resembles the hades boss music "the unseen ones"
I feel a nimona vibe from her
I guess the design team really liked Nimona lol
Void Version of Jinx...
revert morde
Honestly i appreciate they didnt make her just Super evil wants to eat everyone, she atleast tries not to kill people she sorta likes, much more interesting than  the unending appetite trope
Gotta wait for Chilling Smite, Challenging Smite, Dabuin, and many others to make fun of this champion. 😂
0:35-0:50How would Mortal Kombat would look like if it were for children...
New word learned: Pillory
Look at her FEET! Look at her THIGHS! O_O
i feel like just looks like “powder” with hips
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE? BUENISIMOOOOOOOOOOO
Animation team is the very best of Riot.  I can't wait for the next season of Arcaneeeeee!!!
Would Jinx want to best friends or feel threatened? Yknow new girl being psycho and all
Arcane season 2 be like.    Also I can't wait to beat her with kled. Cause he's the best no changing my mind
IT SHOULD BE ME NOT HIM!
*Totaly not Nimona*
she looks fun to play!
So... Vampire Goth Girl Jinx?
I loved this!
Rule 34...
It's funny how they thought one enchanted restraint and a normal jail door was gonna hold her
Woahhhh
smash
idk why but the inside of this Noxian prison looked like Zaun lol
Designer is without doubt not an anime lover and foot fetishist.
Oh wow, somebody watched Nimona recently.
0:58 when the guards see her you can hear the sound of the ping of caution
parece un asesino anti tankes
No one talks about how thick she is tho
Once again animation is crazy
So when do we get the janitor as a new champ? Dude showed more competence kiting than most early game ADC I support.
I liked the video
Nimona vibes <3
Annnnd another assassin
The lack of feet comments is disgusting
this is just Nimona
Imagine still playing this game in its current state lol
i want a vampire escape buddy too
LOL içeriğini hangi ekip üretiyorsa.. artık işi bırakıp gidip ölene kadar tatil yapsın.. Bir şeyler yapmak için çöpleri kullanan şirkete TENCENT denir.!
All right, now with her trailer and bio, Briar is awesome... and Thicc
At 0:57 we can hear the warning ping.  But i like to imagen a tilted player spamming 😂
hey anyone watch nimona?
Nimona de LoL
i can fix her
Keep spamming out Disney characters RetardGames, oh and i also love when you mutilate the lore for your new champs. 🙂🔫
Hear me out...
Все хуже и хуже синиматики. Набор спрайтов
getting heavy Nimona vibes....... and i'm all for it, fookin love that movie 😂
I really like the art style
Briar's Lullaby is my favorite part about her honestly
I like characters like briar. I call them ravengers. Characters that come in and just start ripping things up and gaining health back like nocturn or classic Evelyn. Or Warwick.
Nimona: Metal
Briar... WAIT TF IS A DANGER PING DOING IN-
So basically Jinx+Vlad?
Def inspired by Nimona, at least somewhat
She’s got such Nimona vibes it’s not even funny. I love it, and can’t wait to see what she’s like from someone who isn’t as clearly insane as she is.
xd
It's weird knowing her eyes is based on cataract patients.
Jinx meets Alucard
I honestly think that more serious vibe, something like ww trailer, would fit better.
This amination rules!!
shes kinda Jinx crazy but looking forward to Jinx - Briar interactions
What in the Tai Lung was this escape?
wow another harley queen probably 1000 years old but looks like a child champ yay
Man why she's wearing a shoe
Amazing
Really good animation. riot should really make a series            Its been so long. Arcane season 2 pls rito
I'm getting major "Nimona" vibes from the animation style and I absolutely love it
Just imagine if she and jinx met.
I didn't know Meruccubus was in league now, now it all makes sense!
Love the fact that every move that she use to fight the guards is actually in the champion kit.
Oh hey there Orin from BG3
focused to the amazing cinematic
Can you remind me of Naomi?
Dont play league but I will be waiting till the lor release in a few years. Looks pretty cool
Tai lung anyone?
I want her to get on top of me too
I like her! She NUTS!! Like Nimona!!!
to quote my favorite lore-tuber, Necrit. "She's dummy thicc on purpose!"
This might be the least matching voice in the entire series
she got that anime jinx voice lmao cool trailer
Jinx's new best friend
why she wear shoes? This is the biggest crime in the history of art
Excellent
I <3 Nimona 2.0
When your 'Escape Buddy' turns out to be the final boss 😂💀
I love the music in the elevator chase part so much
Jinx's sister?
oh yes, she will be fed. ggwp
만약 이 바보들이 이 비디오에서처럼 좋은 그래픽으로 게임을 흥미롭게 만들 수 있다면 모두가 플레이할 것입니다.
she bad asf
Would love to see gore next time 😂 Idk what's wrong with me😂
A leake from riot, nice
Escape buddy didn't collapse because of fear briar smashed his whole head through the gate made of only god knows
a friend for jinx?
I can fix her
Escape buddy now has a vampire friend who would massacre a village to protect him.  He gets to be the voice of reason she rarely listens to and can never escape.
twitter (or now X) is out for blood on her character design, but when has twitter ever been a place of levelheaded people, its a place filled with all kinds of odd people.
So Vladimir is the sophisticated vampire and Briar is like a newly birthed ghoul? I’m actually excited to play her though she looks absolutely goofy
riot, cool vid. But we wanna see the feet!!!
1:16 i can see the "art" already... IMAGINE  IMAGINE IMAGINE  IMAGINE
The animation is crazy good in this trailer
My favourite part is the signature color being raspberry and they actually included one fruit ninja style. Such a fun combo 🍓 need a new emoji 🥰
I bet she's got the same VA as Jinx 👀.
UUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH
She feels so much like a Guilty Gear character
i like it!
That’s gotta be Jinx’s voice actress, right?
hypermobile assasin again rip
what an amazing concept.
Whoa!! Nimona in League of legends now
What if Jinx…but vampire?
dude legit looks so fun, leagues becoming good again
This maybe Riot's shortest cinematic to date, but crazy powerful nonetheless.
the design is very Nimona, I love it
that comic-graffiti style looks so good!
Please Riot I can't stand soloq, bring back Arena
cringe
animation like spiderverse movie, I mean look like comic
Uuuhhh... Nimona?  Are you ok?
Jinx's voice?
Bootleg lifestealer got it
Sylas and briar will make great friends.
Jinx vibes
I can fix her
She’s Harley-Quinn meets Nemona.
So wait.   The block her arms are kept in  Just... Comes apart.   And no one, at any point in time, thought they should put something slightly more permanent on there?  If this is because she's a sort of secret weapon, that actually makes it worse. Especially if these Noxians or their superiors engineered that block.  That means they would most likely have the know how to work around it?   The Runeforge material isn't common, either, so that's a deliberate, invested effort.  I guess this is another "LeBlanc is up to schemes that are going to be dangled out of reach forever" story.  I actually like briar, but i don't think Noxus needs to look like a bunch of drooling braindead-on-arrival simpletons to make the character look competent.
gives me Nimona vibes. but just a tad more crazy
Jinx at home.
The animations are good but her voice acting is terrible
would
Ok, who fed Briar? Insta report
Shalltear Bloodfallen 100%
Fruit ninja+jinx
Made me wonder if she was support until she started a murder spree ngl
She's super pretty :P pfhheeettt
MedMen Stock Running Up Now! Health Services Directs DEA to Reschedule  Marijuana! Buy MedMen Stock! Mmnff.........
that animation is sick
hey can i be your friend ?
Riot pls contact the cringe hedgehog
<<<jungle main here :D
I can fix her
Nimona?
New champ brah
Wild rift pls launch on india
like a Disney movie
What if vampire, but she Jinx...😮‍💨 I hope she at least plays well.
This feels like nemona with extra steps
I wonder how many times she's going to be banned before people start playing her...
甜妹！甜甜甜❤❤❤想被briar骑在身下😊
5 terrible champs for this. Maybe they are back on the right track.
League of animes 🤷🏻‍♂️
She seems cute ❤
Very Jinx energy
WHAT?!?
Nimona Inspo fr, it's also giving jinx so I hope she does pop up in the second season of Arcane as well, she'd fit as a quick cameo running from the under city goons trying to keep her as a pet fr😂
one word: thornmail
Tai lung in league wtf
Calling it now. I bet whatever rage mode her ultimate/passive provides will be extended after its set duration by the travel time the shackles take from the point of cast to her current location.
I CAN FIX HER GUYS, HEAR ME OUT
I can fix her fr fr.......
Is that a world rune in her hand cuffs?
It should have been me not him
Al i see is the Tai Lung escape scene from kungfu panda, and i love it
She Is nimona
Reminds me of that movie, nimona
I can fix her.
Cringe
Ngl i wouldn't mind waiting if this champ dropped on October for Halloween.
Brair and Jynx would be best friends imo...
Ah evil Nimona vibes, love it. Metal. >:3
Millenial hero
she sounds and looks like Nemona from Netflix, cool!
I don't how I like the jinx two personality.
shalltear ?
Ehemm 🫢, I can fix her 🫣
MOMMY
I can fix her
Jinx but eats people.
Cool trailer and all but I didnt see her feet/toes like the splash art. Maybe Riot is doing some rethinking about it. Hopefully they keep it as is with the lil piggies out. Throw a bone to the foot fetish ppl 😂
Im in love
cool!
I can fix her.
oh yay another champion already
GIGA based cinematic ngl
Again. Fantastic work by the animation team. 100/10
This is the most violent non-violent movie I have ever seen and I cannot express how much I love it.
Why no blood?
She looks more crazier than Jinx lol
Rule 34 is coming hard !
SHES SO CUTE
its giving nimona
I like how it's full-on violence but with a suppressor
Is this Jinx? She sounds like Jinx. She's related to Jinx, right?
Don't feed
Spider-who?
I don't know why people are simping on this abomination💀
Oh, Jinx with pink hair et no guns.
thighs
This is absolute garbage
Ngl briar remind me shalltear from overlord
Giving those Nimona vibes with that wildchild personality
Where's the feet
Riot wtf guys why u do this
A great design ruined by a "pick me" personality with meh voice acting. Pretty much if Zoe became a vampire...hype immediately ruined
I think the character's voice and personality is identical to Jinx.
Huh neat
Jinx?
Easily my fave champ yet. Im a sucker for vampires and she is such an oddball, cuteykins.   Her predicament is perfect for a romance story too. Like a Twilight mixed with Rapunzel. Briar and Janitor, ship em!
She's giving me Nimona vibes
Im guessing when she transforms thats her ultimate
It’s reminding me of Nimona. I love this so much. Briar looks awesome
if she won't maul me to death, slice me n dice me I DO NOT WANT IT
Кринжово аж до мурашек
An animation so good, it almost makes me forget about their AI-generated LatAm video… Almost.
just when you thought arcane was peak style
obviously a Champ with a million dashes, what else do you expect? 😂
anyone have no life n wanna play league of legends w me? Im currently emerald 2,  16 years old, male and student.
soo good\
Scream once if friend  Scream twice if food 😂
I’ve seen this somewhere before I can’t remember where
She's equally addicted to blood like League players are addicted to League.
Ah yes r34 incoming
Yay... Jinx 2.0... so exciting... not
So just a Noxian Jinx
I CAN FIX HER
Goddammit rule 34 artists are fast af.
jinx's sister for sure
Another mascot for girls who think they are edgy, bad, and cool but have too much social anxiety to tell a waitress they got their order wrong.
Voice choice is teribe . I hope ıt wıll be better ın  Turkısh dub
I am living for this animation style ❤❤ so much life and story
She gives the same energy as nimona
0:02 - 0:06 is literally common infected sounds in L4D2, anyone?
Isn't she blind, why she said "wow" looking ahead? If only there was a 18+ cinematic version with real blood 😮
Gorillaz girl confirmed? Xd
So by the way she was protecting the janitor... I'm guessing she's a support? :)
someone in riot saw Nimona
She reminds me of nim… she is also very cute…
I like her :)
Great video but what kind of vampire can withstand the sunlight?
Another 400 year champ
I wonder if she will have 15 dashes?
Y'all still want heer feet?😂
That's a pretty badass character design.  Well done.   I was always hoping you'd expand the lore a bit, include more mythological beings (vampires, werewolves, etc).  Excellent.  Btw, can we get a playable family member for Rengar, and also expand the lore for Nocturne?  Cheers
Why the hype music?
Can't wait for the theme!!!
Vampire Jinx, right.
I think, she is like Jinx 3.0
Why does I remember her of  shaltier from overlord...
She-Suigetsu 🌊💪
Ah ok shes not nimona
Another jinx, fun i guess
We already have Jinx we don’t need one more
Riot trying too hard to make another Jinx. It's not working - feels weird and forced
Briar in frenzy mode kind of reminds me of old Korean art of Dokkaebi(korean goblins)
She's my type of woman..
Not gonna lie, I enjoyed that way more than i expcted. Well done to the people who made it.
Reminds me so much of Shalltear from Overlord.
We get it, you watched across the Spider-Verse & thought Hobie was cool.
So that was her ult ? Or maybe an activated passive ?
Riot literally made a champion that will get stronger if it's been fed in Game. 😂
This is absolutely Nimona themed
evelynn 2.0
BRING BACK THE GRIPPERS PLEASE
Briar wants to be friends........ Amumu looking for friends.......     ......I wonder what kind of interaction they would have on each other
"I can fix her"
I love the danger ping sound in 0:59
I swear to god this is Shalltear from Overlord
Nimona is that you but an actual monster? OwO
Im starting to think no one noticed the ?? ping at 0:59 i like to think the first guys that died are pinging them from fountain
She makes jinx look like a Girl Scout
Why does this animation makes me think about Nimona 😭
Now moonton please copy this one
RIOT always horny😂
Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life!!!✝️🤍
Shaltear Bloodfallen's twin sister :flush:
this has borderland vibes. love it  also, imagine what she smells like
Nimona, is that you? Also Tai Lung escape scene <3
Ah yes, a female champion with a high pitch voice, cute at first but deadly later vibe , loose cannon personality and pink aesthetics.
reminds me of Nimona
would
League wtf, y’all stay cooking with these animations lol
All this animations and character design just for them to nerf Akali once again
I'm starting to be a little tired of the psychotic and destructive yet  innocent, hyperactive child like character. But the trailer really did her a good introduction tbh, amazing animation
It should've been me not him!
"I can fix her", sure you can.
Feet
While i love the design and such, her personality kinda feels...samey? Its pretty much just Jinx with some naivity of neeko.
Nimona vibes
Would
Is this a Nimona Sequel?
"Escape Buddy" 😅
they add Gawr Gura)) cool
Nimona vibe and i love it🫶❤️‍🔥
I can fix her
cringe
Beautiful 😍
Trash bring me back the Good Old Days with champions with normal kits I haven't yet understood how Aphelios works and yet these out of the box champs keeps racking up and i swear it's gonna be anothet broken champ everyone will hate  Mark my words
we love a vampire jinx moment
THE WHISTLING THEME AND THE ROCK-OUT THEME HAVE THE SAME MELODY TO SIGNIFY HER CHANGE IN CHARACTER WHEN SHE GOES BERSERK
Sensing some Nimona vibe right now!
What if Jinx and Nimora had a kid?
Looks so amazing ❤😂
not me frantically worried i had a league game going because of the danger pings in the trailer
Yeah, I can fix her.
Great... again a crazy in the rift. 🥱 Should call the game League of Crazy. It becomes a crazy hospital. 🥱
Fruit Ninja yeah?
The alert ping tho 0:59 good touch riot
I imagine this is what the minions see.
Jinx 2.0?
rule 34, i'm co(u)mming
0:58 the pings 🤣🤣🤣🤣
more jumps
Тупо Тайлунг из тюрьмы вылез😮
I'm getting Nimona vibes and I like it
She's a big old Nimona reference! Those teeth don't lie!
shes giving me jinx from arcane, insane, but sweet <3
I think she have a same as sylas
If jinx become vampire
Another op champ? ._.
Briar in Arcane 2?
Did the voice actor jinx voiced this- sounds very much like her 😭😭
Jinx have 3 friend now ,1 more champ and we have team " Hyper crazy explosion team"  Jinx ,ziggs, kled ,Briar
man this animation gets me excited for arcane season 2!
1:17 "THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN ME, NOT HIM!! "
jinx/vex/qiyana new champ?
At this point u might as well change the game name to League of Ladies as 8 out of 9 recent characters are all female lmao. rito games L glad I left this cringe feministic game long time ago.
Simona lookin ahh
This is Jinx if she went to prison
Why does this look like Nemona?
oh alright so she can tell who is friends of hers in that state, thats good to know...
Fun fact the chamo is not even out yet and theres already 70+ results on r34
omg can you hear "be careful" ping too?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1 million view in 18 hours!!!!!! lol more than doja cat....
Hymmmm this animation is soo clouse to something but i like it
I HEAR JINX THOU
Darius walks Up combos her and then use r
I was hoping for more gorey and scary vibe, but we got another jinx, cool i guess
This had a nimona vibe, and i love it
Ok.. hear me out
Briar is almost like Nimona.
Looks like somebody watched nimona ;)
So she's a noxian /vastaya/vampire (group of vladimr)  ?
warwick e girl what??
close enough, drop arcane already
It looks like the love child of nimona and jinx😂
Hahahah the fruit ninja reference
Am I the only one who notice a Fruit Ninja reference in there (0:49)? Naafiri trailer completely obscure this trailer in comparison... about the champion... another young anime character... so much that they could've done with the vampire thematic, this looks like a waste.
Someone watched Nimona and liked it   And I cannot blame them cause I liked it too
Jinx my ♥love ♥ you have competition now.
Nimona it’s you?
:O and now I'm wondering if she'll make it to LoR (or TFT I suppose)  Gotta love psychos with a weird soft spot. Dude is going to be PTSD AF when he wakes up.
I don't like this cartoon style. I was hoping for fiddlesticks vibe
fix game MORONS
UUUUOOOOOHHHH!!! 😭
Woe very friendly cinematic, amazing. Great work devs
Amazing
Despite not seeing actual violence, I like how this is her perspective when she goes frenzy. It’s like a kid who eats and play with her food.
¨wasn't that fun???????????¨:DDD
I like it
december 2022 : riot has the best  trailers and cinematics  januar 2023 : riot has the worst cinematics august 2023 : riot has definitly the best cinematics  Am I alone thinking about this netflix film ? something like nimona or mnemona with a demon girl and futurist knights ?
Isn't this just a bity version of Jinx? With the same voice?
bro I wish this is pg 18
Jinx 2.0
Personality wise she's just Jinx... They even took the same voice actor lol
shes running to see me guys. I'm her boyfriend.
Nimona?????
The animation style just screams Nimona and I'm here for it <3
Fortiche does it again
Briar similar to mellisa from mlbb
League of tanks update
so cute😍😍😍😍
Just counter with Malphite and say goodbye to those teeth
There is nothing to fix here, she's perfect 😍
She cut that man's grapes.
They did not Had to Go That Hard for a trailer.
Unkillable sion with built in life steal + Global ults coming back? Those Who Do Not Learn History Are Doomed To Repeat It.
So jinx basically but vampire like and without guns
wow! the chinese must of been mad with the black and fujo pandering done at Riot games california . thank you tencent for giving us this cute loli!
She’s just like Nimona.
i expected the jumpscare from the client but it still got me💀🤦
How to show gore without showing gore.
She's like the bloodthirsty female version of Sylas, except she's on a pillory and not on chains🙃
A noxian huh? What are they putting in the water there? 💀
I love that she thinks he's escaping too so she treats him as a friend LOL
It reminds me Monster High somehow 😂
Sylas: Soo...?  Okey thanks for ult
Animation team saw spider-man and were like 🤔🤔🤔
Love the exclamation mark pings in the video lool
this is actually good not expected but wow!!!
Nimona is that you? xD
Oh, I can see some Nimona inspiration here 😂
3rd vore character
Reminds me a lot of Nimona
Come on Riot. Thats literally just jinx. Wtf is this character design? Mobile legends? Bullsh*t
Am I tripping or is that the same voice actor that voices Jinx
Yoooooo!!!! What happened to Jinx?????????????
Jinx got captured by the Noxians and gave her blood magic
I can feed her!
Nie rozumiem trochę projektu tej postaci. Posiada ona coś w rodzaju "kajdan"? Nie jestem nawet pewna czy ten metal ją pęta, gdyż w umiejętnościach nagle są zrywane i skądś pojawiają się sztylety (lepsze byłby tasaki, podkreślające cechę postaci), którymi atakuje - następnie pęto wraca. W momencie, gdy kajdany są zrywane nie sądzę, aby bohater chciał znowu dać się związać... Czy jest to gdzieś wyjaśnione w jej lore? Czy to jest coś na zasadzie blokady, która temperuje jej obżarstwo i na jakiej zasadzie do niej wraca?

i want kiss her 😍😍😍😍
She reminds me of Shalltear from Overlord
Did she just pull a Tai Lung jailbreak?
She's got JINX VIBES !!! I love her... XD  Also..... Every League Player Ever Heard this sound... 0:57 XD
Sorry Jinx, but in my mind this is the new League poster girl
Kinda has some Nimona vibes
I love Briar ❤
The voice reminds me too much of Arcane Jinx tho. Needs some time to get used to it
Reminds me of venom
Looks breedable though 😳
The alarm pings 😂
R34 gonna have a blast with this one
Sylas getting a gf
Lame!  No restraint mouth guard when you know she is aroused and empowered with blood?
dude i thought it was another season of arcane
ok jhinx demon
If she plays to ninja fruit with guards as she plays to ninja fruits with champions I want to play her. Fast.
god new champs feel like a kid saying:"and then it also can do thit and that and these too!"
cool
GOOD LORD
she's just like laby, my waifu. my new waifu uwu
Yay, we got Nimona that actually kills people🎉
Jaja pinguearon a los guardias por estar bien piedras!
Another character that was not able to be stopped by anything. Another 200 years of powercreep
I saw at least 5 dashes
Same voice actor as Jinx?
This looks like Shalltear from overlord
So she’s like Nimona and jinx had a baby.
ARA ARA hmmmmm!
holy
Shalltear Bloodfallen has arrived in runeterra
Jinx goes melee?
I can fix her.
An even more psycho Jinx.  This champ will be balanced
This champion looks like shes going to have _so many dashes_ Can't wait! Maybe they will give her some sort of shielding and life steal. Ohh boy! It would be great if she scales off of kills so that she snowballs impossibly high. Wow! She kinda sounds like Jinx from Arcane
Such a cool aesthetic
Just jinx in a different body
Giving me Nimona vibes
Какой классный синематик. Мне так понравился. Уже хочется поиграть ❤
new champion?
"She's been feed".... Yup, never heard that
Feels very Nimona
very lame champ.
She reminds me of Shaltear from Overload
She remainsme of Nimona
Shalltear in LoL Kingdom
She reminds me of jinx
She's uglier than her splash art. I love it.
This reminds me of the blood rage in Wet
Wow, she kinda reminds me of Shallteat Bloodfallen from Overlord anime. A vampire, that is nice and chill until she starts fighting and feeding on blood. Nice one!!!
the animation was amazing, glad to see more work done by the league team, its been such a while they haven't teased stuff like that with great animations and art, although i feel the gore part quite necessary for this champ, to feel the psycho part and how scary she is and mostly to bring back that mature part of league
Pero no fuera el evento del Rey Arruinado porque ni ganas le echan
I wish i was lucky like that cleaner 😕
Yuki?
WoAH another unoriginal female character? Next will be a boring dude with his shirt off.
Haruko from FLCL reimagined !!!
Holyyyyy
Arcane vibes. She would be best friends with Jinx.
Jinx personality? Zzzzzz 😴
How did they manage to subdue her and lock her up to begin with? And if they managed to do that once, why didn't they take away her weapons?
Jinx and Sylas got together it seems.
Would
She sounds like Jinx, and Awkwafina too.
Didn't league say she wasn't going to be a femme fatal cause there are already so many but they literally just made Jinx again...
She seems more like a ghoul than a Vampire... But also she reminds me a bit of Hellsing's (The anime with Alucard) vampires,  her powers could fit that universe, bit whatever
1:15 God I wish I was him! its not fair! ☺🥵😳😳
Oh look, it's Jinx v2
ITS SUPPOSED TO BE ME !!! NOT HIM 😢
Her and jinx team up
Smash
This animation reminds me a lot of Borderlands and Tiny Tina XD
i'm getting nimona vibes off this chick
Yeay... Another mindless killer...
She's like, Jinx if she was a vampire. 👍
SHEEEESHHHHH
new champion that can dash 100x times again 😥
Why do i see SHALLTEAR from Overlord in her like shalltear's lamprey form
Jungler?
My review is a generic anime with high quality animation.
Now if you told me THIS was who Jinx's sister is, I would believe you lol. But even if they're not, I hope they become friends :)
I hope she's AP ... I'm tired of AD champions ...
Vampire Jinx
Please get rid of the sexual innuendos when it’s character that is child coded. Not acceptable. Like I get you are trying to market to peds in your largest region but that is not a good idea.
smash
Woo she's cool.
0:58 those question mark ping are from other guards who have died: "what are you doing?"
Heavy nimona vibes
Its really giving a Nimona vibe
Would...
Nimona, is that you
gorillaz?
I can fix her
Guys hear me out, i can fix her
Vampire that turns into a goblin, that's a new one...
Harley Quinn if she was a vampire
Where the feet are XD
Boring..
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The animation team took inspiration from spiderman into the spider verse, and I'm loving it.
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
new main. i cant wait!
She reminds me to Shaltear bloodfallen from Overlord
take my money briar$$$,she looks AWESOME!!!
Am I the only one who’s getting flashbacks from the Nimona movie?
Ugly champion. Not gonna use
not as horror/scary as id hope  melee jinx ig
So she has a LOT of mobility and and "Unleashed" Ult.   Neat
i can fix her
Feet monster
STRYGWYR
oh my God lol Jeez that was dope. makes me really want more seasons of Arcane! please League more Arcane!
Same voice actor as jinx, to familiar, could actually hear jinx's voice in her from time to time
I can fix her
You can't tell me this isn't heavily inspired from "NIMONA" :)
reminds me of jinx
What an absolute Goblin.
its giving nimona vibes
wheres the feet though
THE PING SOUND WHEN GUARDS SAW HER I'M DYING
I'm having some Nimona flash backs with this. She seems nice
Is that you nimona?
shes so cool...
that's so hot
**GASPS** Is that Shalltear Bloodfallen form the Overlord anime???!?!!???!!?? **Gasps Again**  Jk. But I have to give it them though, her design looks so familiar with Shalltear everytine she goes blood frenzy.
This is done in the arcane art style, just saying
and the r34 is going to make the "breeding frenzy"
So tou can be friends with her? 🥰
Getting Nimona vibes from her…
Qiyana vampire version?😂
So this is why their other AI generated cinematic was so trash, they spent everything on the Briar cinematic💀💀
At least the animation team do more effort than the balance team
looks great. love all the animation following into the spiderverse. also sounds like jinx
are we all in agreement that we dont wear boots on Briar?
They should really stop making league, they seem to be better at literally everything else they do
0:58 that ping sound
Bro what in the anime fan service Waifu undead “small girl” is this
Would...
This got some Nimona vibe to it
This is Nimona from Nimona.
Another weaponized superhuman escaped... average Noxus monday.
I'd be your friend babygirl hmu
Would.
Her theme 😍
I guess blood is just pink now in Runeterra.
Jinx plus Evelyn?
jinx vibes
i thought i was watching a Vex animation this caught me so off guard 😢
I'M STILL NOT HAPPY ARENA IS GONE! But.... <3 I hella love you because vampire girl and the maturity went up! Thank you for recognizing that Diablo IV is in the marketplace! Now we can compete! Let's do this!
Like for the metal soundtrack
Would
she's like if nimona was more criminally insane
🙋‍♂️Who wants to take the role of the guy?
actually better than dagger husky's
I can fix her
This new crazy cinematic made me freakin' hungry nomnomnomnomnom 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
bro downloaded the wrong jinx
"i can fix her"
0:59 that int ping lol
So this is Arcane s2 Art will look like
nimona
The guy she saved has the perfect setup to be a parody of Renfield lmao.
I get the feeling a certain Netflix show helped inspire this character.
would
I bet she's gonna have some sort of armor penetration ability, and dash ability most likely would be able to go through walls. And her ult would probably be a scream that knocks back enemies.
Apart from jinx maybe
Imagine having her in season 2 of the show she would body everyone
1:14 IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME NOT HIM!!!
Is this not just reskinned Ty long escaping prison?
เธอก็น่ารักดีนะ😂
League could very easily be a top 10 game if it wasn't the most boring gameplay in human history
Smash, next
Is the escape buddy a part of the champion?
I can fix her
She has the same vibes as Shalltear Bloodfallen
Possibly scary champ ruined. Neat, another cringe “yordle”
if only people didnt leak the kit and the splash without spoiler warnings....
I can fix her
Jinx as a vampire? did the writers forget to write a new character?
BAD LOOK AT STARRAIL ANIMATIONS!!!
se viene paja, chavales
This is cool
so bad look at starrail terrible animation LOL
She makes me think she could be Jinx’s cousin
Wow love it
I can’t wait for the community to do absolutely nothing weird with this champ!!!!
Now someone has to make a comic of Jinx, Zoe and Briar having a world tour together.
She is fittingly named.
Tell me she is Jinx's mad cousin. Love her!!!!
0:59 ! !
feet
cool cool
Noxian Jinx I guess
I'm calling out to dear Riot Game from here. Please make at least a 3-episode anime or movie for each character, or turn all the events in the lol universe into a long movie, anime or series. But I think the animated ones are the most beautiful ones. If you do it, it will be watched and I think it will attract a lot of people who play lol.
Jinx 2.0 😂
Why do i see nimona 😭
Feels like borderlands tbh.
who let riot watch Nimona
MAN Leblanc sure has been on a huge Loss streak lately
She's so nimona
I want a friend like her
0:58 I love that ping sound detail
Youtube she just slicing a fruit.
So, she's jinx? as a vampire?
I love how she says “Hiiiiieee” 😂😂
Fairly certain that's animators from Arcane and that's the voice of Jinx.
She reminds me of shalltear from overlord
Between FLESH and BLOOD
My friend said It’s like Jinx and Nimona combined And honestly that’s 100% accurate
Make escape buddy a *CHAMPION NOW*
where my urf
She sounds like Arcane's Jinx. same VA?
Just finna get this theme song
I'm going to be her best friend
jinx + warwick?
oh look, Jinx but from noxus
FEET FEET FEET FEET
Don't know why but, I feel like jinx just got a new friend.
RELEASE THE THEME ALREADYY
This champ looks awesome, reminds me of Warwick though
I don't get why they reworked Jinx. They need to stick to reworking champs that actually need a rework. Signed, a Jinx main.
WOW.
She's literally just Jinx, but a vampire. She even kinda sounds like Jinx I hope her gameplay is super fun, because the personality being Jinx 2.0 is a bummer
When Nimona is more violent than even her graphic novel version
She sounds just like jinx…
she reminds me of that vampire from overlord
So WW/Jinx. So inspiring....
Why i feel she like nimona Huh... strange
where feet
stun, taunt, knock, flee.. qwer as the champion pool with cc has still shortage! Another version of gaelo/sion.. Animation is super cool though!
Blind Zoe with Warwick mode. . .Wow,just. . .Wow
Hellsing vibe...love it
Nimona ??
How can you make something brutal and NOT brutal at the same time???  Also I don't know what anyone says about her, this champion is adorable and I want to hug her.
1:17 omg she gave him the cardiovascular arrest, i need her now
Nimona 2 rated R.
Not what I was hoping for when seeing the splash art
Nimoma It's you?
Soooooooo she’s just…. Vampire jinx?
Well someone really liked Nimona.
escape buddy! hahahaha
Character design similar like shalltear bloodfallen from overlord anime😅😅
Wait, isn't this just.. Nimona? The sounds, the animation, and even her visual style is totally Nimona.
Riot animation team being the absolute goats of all time
Foota
Is this LOL or Nimona XD
I remember Nimona heheh
Love the style! It reminds me of Netflix's Nimona
First you give us cyborg legs with Camille now you give us vampire feet
i would drag my nuts through 10 miles of lemon juice and broken glass to see the fortiche peoples methods
Wat ever happened to lolyourprincess 😅 asking for a friend
Is it just me who imagine her with a boney/super skinny body? That thick body seems out of place.
she gives off beeg Nimona vibes i love it
It's the league pings that got me 😂
Long lost sister of Nimora?
would
i can fix her
Seems like a bloodthirsty version of Powder to me
Yes feet
Nimona animation vibes
Vampire Jinx, that's cute..her music for this cinematic wasn't nearly as good though
ayo the pizza's here
Of Kled and Vlad had a kid
got that Nimona vibes
Calling it now, if Briar and Jinx meet. They gonna be bbfs without question
She's adorable
PLZ DONT MAKE A WARWICK RIPOFF
Oh look, it's Shalltear Bloodfallen.
Show toes u cowards
ripping off nimona now
she make jinx look sane lol
aaaand another lame female champ.
Briar gives me the "Nimona" Vive, the trailer is artwork, how the violence it handles is amazing
would
So she is like Jinx if she was Noxian... pretty cool but where Kled interactions.....
breeding frenzy
Here comes... The 🌟Corn🌟... Welcome.
I can fix her
Wish they would have kept the animation style a little more close to the fiddle sticks video or Warwick. But this was still amazing.
What if her gameplay is that she starts off as ridicoulously high offense and she gets progressively weaker but with higher defense as she levels up. LoL.
RIOT went Fruit Ninja on this one
FEETing frenzy
Nimona better animation
Is her voice actress the same as Jinx? They sound very similar.
I can fix her.
Oh great. More rule 34.
Reminds me of R-rated Nimona.
is she the real jinx sister?
Amazing animation and violence-non-violence too !!
Jinx & Kled, combined Nice!
warwick x jinx
When Riot watched Nimona and thought: "She needs more psychopath, then it makes sense."
0:58 that ping soubd cracked me up
Ok Tai Lung has escaped
Nimona there are you?
its literally just a vampire version of jinx.
i want to see her fight warwick
if tiny Tina was born in Rune Terra
shaltear  is that you?
Riot creating and releasing red-crazed woman lately, i think i see a pattern here
I LOVE IT
great.....another champ to perma-ban/pick for the next 2 months till ANOTHER new champ shows up....the cycle continues
Shalltear vibes
Please god let her be in the fighting game
lmao they used the "WARNING!" ping noise
Me: "Mom I want Jinx" Mom: "We have Jinx at home"  Jinx at home:
So this is why Arcane season 2 hasnt come out yet
Nimona vibes
assassin type I see hmmmm
"Escape Buddy..." HAHAHAHA
Ah yes "feeding frenzy" my favourite chilhood fish game😂
So jinx went blind and became a blood-lusted vampire? Makes sense 😂
I can fix her
when did jinx get bitten by vampire
She reminds me Shalltear Bloodfallen from Overlord
Arcane Jinx VA ???
the splash is better than this calarts level garbage
ngl, i can't lie, idk if someone from LOL was on board with this but the vibe of this is totally Nimona from netflix, is this even legal?
SHE'S A BORDERLANDS CHARACTER
So I take it she counters Vladimir?
Gives a whole 'nother meaning to feeding the midlaner.
Nice OST from the hellsinger guys
Good warwick power creep
smash
"Jinx is such a popular character we're going to make another one"
Why she sounds familiar?
Omg Jinx and her would have destruction
Bro, she lowkey reminds me of Nimona.
I want to breed her
I thought vampires only go at night
'I Can Fix Her "
I feel like this was inspired by nimona with the art style and character personality.
He definitely missed shooting his shot. Could've gotten a crazy vampire GF!
10/10 god animation and trialer
So, are you lot paying Nimona royalties for this or what?
Nimona?
Insane! The style kind of looks like Nimona
they put her shoes 😔
I see someone was inspired by Nimona jejeje great video!
Omg
make movies man 💲💲
Vampire Nimona unsure whether to say ugh about lack of imagination or be horrified at the prospect of jinx having a little sister.
All the guards died not because they tried to stop Briar, but because one guard in particular shoved aside the janitor and Briar was not having it.
The Frenzy Mode, It's Kinda Remember Me Of Shaltear Bloodfallen From Overlord
Well what’s his face seems a bit on edge lol
Would
Getting serious Nimona vibes.
she gives off strong nimona vibes
Vampire jinx
Nimona?
Getting some Nimona vibes from this champ
so... melee jinx?
Jinx but Noxus?
now i wanna see her special interactions with jinx, they're so similar
Yes noxus jinx is all i needed 😊
Oh, hi Nimona
See going berserk :  Slice and dices  See grape slices : oh god no she didn't
I also eat people
It's pink instead of red 'cause , you know...  China
Its jinx but from noxus
this is literally shalltear bloodfallen from overlord anime
that ping was for teamfight that went wrong
Jinx but Mundo
Who else came for feet?
She reminds me of nimona ❤ so cool 🔥
she is Shallthear Bloodfallen HAHAHAHAHAH
This champ will have tons of memes. First blood, she got fed.... Animation was great as usual from the riot carry team 😂
why make it friendly,just show us gore plz once an  time.. not hurt right?
I can fix her
im so excited for her
At last so funny 😂😂😂
Is her voice actress the same that plays adult Jinx in Arcane?
FINISH ARCANE FIRST
Arcane art style ❤❤❤
😭😭😭 uwhooo
Yo, is that a KungFu Panda reference?
Nemona on League hahaha love it
Wish I was escape buddy
Her vibes feels like it is someone from Nimona
... soo Noxian Jinx?  I can't help but hear Jinx in her voice.
2 personalitys :o
Praying for Arcane season 2
The way she goes “Huh? Escape buddy!” makes me wanna give her a pat
id love it if in her lore she just follows that one guy around calling him friend as he desperately tries to get away from her
ok who let Carnage make out with Jinx??
solteira?
Ok anybody getting "OverLord - Shalltear Bloodfallen" here?
bootleg shalltear
I love it when [danger ping]
Tell me you love Nimona without telling me you love Nimona
Anyone else getting major Nimona vibes from her?
Nimona but adult version
lets goooo!!!
She's giving Spider Punk vibes 😅
I can fix her
So.... Vampre Jinx? Neat.
Whole cinematic looked like it came straight out of Arcane's S2.  Let them cook! 🗣️ 🔥
Does this remind anyone of Gawr Gura? Is it just me?
So.... Dota's bloodseeker...?
so... you guys needed a new Jinx huh? Don't get me wrong, she seems great, but come on now, I see you.
Reminds me of Laby, from elsword, but far more evil than she is
No feet?
Was kind of hoping for less jinx and more feral monster/sadistic killer if I'm being honest but could be fun gameplay wise
Voice reminds me of Haruko Haruhara from FLCL. Nice
Sick animation, not a fan of the personality just being nimona jinx
Riot Games is an animation company and they probably have a branch in Spider Punk's universe with that kind of animation
My new girlfriend
Releasing the Vampire champion during a super blue moon (which is a very rare occasion) is classy Riot, well done.
Someone at Riot really liked Nimoma
The animation looks like a combination of Nimona and Across The Spider-Verse
them fruit ninja cuts were nice
Ok I was informed by a friend briar is a Eastern European inspired vampire. The western ones are the ones that transform so I guess she is a vampire or  not because she wasn't one to begin with and she only needs blood to live because of the black rose so idk . She is either based on ones like Nosferatu or just needs blood to live
Shaltear bloodfallen from overlord, I'm glad to see someone else using that kinda design
So.. basically this is vampire Jinx from Noxus...            K'
Long lost sister of Nimona
this is much cooler than i expected imagine if the leak didnt happen this would be a much cooler more interesting. Btw is it me or theres some jinx in her?
It's giving NIMONA vibes
The sequence 100% reminded me of Tai Lung in prison 💥
Soooo briar just really likes playing fruit ninja?
reminds me of evelynn and im here for it
At least they didn't use AI to make this cinematic...
"god i wish that were me"
Nimona
Le cambiaron la Nariz ahora parece un tomate
Smash 😩
That give some borderlands vibe
R34 artists.. What that mouth do? 😏
another garbage disney champ
Sounds like the VA for jinx from Arcane
Now we just need a trio of travesty about Briar, Ziggs and Jinx. A cinematic poem - “An Ode to Oops” I am inspired
Look like shaltear from overlord in true form
So she's vampire Nimona?
As a vampire Briar has any relationship with Vladimir??? I wander....
She sounds nimona from netflix😂
ah yes, Nimona, but if the PG rating was thrown out the window
Needs some Vlad lore
nimona
Why do I feel like she is voiced by Jinx but actually a better Jinx/Warwick character
NIMONA WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
yall are fans of Hobie Brown i see. Cool!
Who put shalltear in league
jinx PagMan
SMAAAAAAAAAAAAASH
so vampire jinx......
Another 'Edgy' champion, another L of a cinematic. Shocker
why does riot hare white men so much? literally every cinematic they do is about white men getting murdered or rescued by women. you never see a cinematic like this with the genders reversed
Bring back the Grippers!!!
Holy sheep! Riot teams are the best, except their balance team, they're crazy..
Reminds me of nimona lol love her vibe
They added Gura to League of Legends.
She was created by the Black Rose as a living weapon but since she was always in her frenzy mode they considered her a failure, in her final mission (which she failed) they gave her the pillory (the giant thing she has on) but was captured by Swain's forces and put into jail. The pillory gave her control over her own mind so now she wants to live and discover the world. And drink blood.   Also she is in a way the daughter of Leblanc and Swain. I love her so much already
Whistles at the end, is Swain orchestrated the jailbreak?
Man if only they put this kinda effort into the actual game engine and balance.
Just seems like jinx
"feeding frenzy" is exactly what most briar players will be described as
I thought its Nimona
You have the music when she’s in frenzy mode, but what about the music when she’s calm, is there a mystery coming up with the lord of this fun vampire? XD
The guards represent your team past 5 mins.
I can fix her
Finally, a champ thats not either a minority/LGBTQ
fInAlLy a cHaMpIoN WoRtH CoMiNg bAcK To lEaGuE
Vampire Jinx? fine i guess
We’ve found Nimona’s evil twin
The litteraly mixed Nimona with Laby from Elsword, Riot is really out of ideas...
Just like Tai Lung but just PINK this time lol
It should've been me NOT HIM!
What happened to the color red? Could it be the influence of Chinese culture?
Thought she would become more monstrous when she turns but hey, not bad- Riot is usually good with their scary champs. Let’s hope they can keep this train moving and in the right direction. Also thank god for her having her knee on “escape buddy” at the end and not her entire, *cough,* body.
I like the animation and all, but I do have a question... wasn't she supposed to be blind? Or was that just a leak that never got confirmed?
Vampire Jinx???
demacia?
riot please dont censore her feet
Feet
SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL THEM TO STOP MAKING NEW CHARACTERS EVERY 2 WEEKS
To me she's a more psycho version of TIny Tina...well more than usual
Instead of a vampire you tell me she is based on Piranha 3D and I'll believe it. When you remake too much a concept strange things happen.
Animation team has NEVER missed. 🔥
Briar is cute.😅
i'm sure i'll enjoy her a lot, but original or outstanding she ain't.  it's just "safe" which is understandable on a pg13 "please all" game. But it is also enjoyable, which is riot's primary aim.  they took inspiration from flandre and remilia scarlet and the bunch of anime and games that have done variations on the concept since then (Mina from dance in the vampire bund, Evangelin from negima, krul tepes from seraph, hazuki from tsukuyomi, lilia vanrouge from twisted wonderland, nimona, etc, can't possibly name them all)  but hey, riot knew this, plenty of people (myself included) will enjoy this archtype being in the game. is it original or pushing any boundaries? NO. is it wasted potential and on the safer side of things? OF COURSE!   But filling this popular niche (vampire/monster jinx lo) means tons of money ahead: There are a LOT of players who would love to play as a character like this, reminding them of other media they enjoy and are fans of. and i just mentiod very few examples, there are plenty and you don't have to dig deep to find them.Original? she isn't. and i wouldn't be surprised if the inspiration from the witch's collar had to be "kidified" because...obviously....they will never give us the real bloody and painful deal on a pg13 game. Of course she was gonna be perfectly fine, clean, and pretty even while wearing a torture device that 9 times out of ten lead to death lol. That said, she looks fun, i'm sure i'll enjoy her kit!  but i'm not looking for originality or "art" in league, just some fun. it's popcorn basically, no nutrionious food here lol.
Ah yes the classic "I'm not like other girls" character.
So we have a caniable gremlin champ now
So, She's just Shalltear Bloodfalllen.
smash
when did jinx turn vampire
0:58 "???" signal caught my guard off lmao 😂😂
I bet she’ll be a part of Project L
So jett nerfed so hard she became a League character?
Come up with a new champion already. you guys are literally just putting old champions together it's insane.
Me in the beggining:hmmm monster girl that feeds on blood and actually looks nosferatu level of scary,okay i hear yeah! Her:"shows dumb anime character like behavior." Me:NEVER MIND! I TAKE IT BACK!
Reminds me a lot of Nimona
Another jinx personality WOOOO...
Now hear me out…
I am down bad for this girl already, shes so hot lmao
I can fix her
The new tiny tina game is a massive disappointment to be honest.
Looks like she'd be a cool friend to have. Bit terrifying, but cool
Hella goofy
No more feet??
So just...nimona...ok then
Certified FRIEND material 👌
Giving me Nimona vibes the animation
Omg, power from chainsaw man!
wow! I like her,like Jinx 1:13
Chogath has some competition.
cmon shoot faster
I absolutely love the danger ping lmao!
Whereee isss theee???? PEETT??
Don't worry guys I can fix her
Riot releases a literal cannibal The comments section: "Omg yaassss, eat meeeee <3"
Jax crying
this is straight pog
¿Spider-Punk + Nimona?
Vladimir added to Wild Rift with new cinematic. New champion that thirsts for blood. _(inhales copium)_ ARE WE FINALLY EXPANDING ON VLAD'S LORE?!
Sigh, they're out of ideas.  No original champ after Ornn.
good
Is this not the same voice actress as jinx?
What is going on with this champion?
Briar infos: She’s a hungry demon and totally insane How Briar is: funny and kinda friendly girl that can distinguish between “good and bad” but will absolutely wreck havoc
Loved the fruit ninja reference 👌👌
That was a suprising amount of energy and personality within just 1 minute and 32 seconds. Hopefully Riot can continue this quality… unlike last time.
When nimona actually when dark xD
I really liked it BUT why did they NERF HER FEET?  This question isn't even for me (I prefer thighs 🙏) but it's for my podolatra friends that I DEMAND AN EXPLANATION.
THAT'S SO COOL
Her and Jinx are gonna be good friends I think
So would her blades work kinda like Irelia's?
the danger pings at 1:00 XDD
"Bro this might be balance."  Riot said before making sylas 4 years ago:
sooooo - vampire Jinx?
Amumu wants a friend. Briar just adopts them.
Big Nimona Energy
She would be best buddies with Jinx , if they do not kill each other. Looking forward to her int the WR ,though, I like her.
Nimona?
Nimona vibes
She thinks she's Tai Lung
Love her and how it's arcane and nimona film from Netfilx
Netflix Nemona inspired?
NGL to you Riot, this won’t make people forget about the AI cinematic.
Nimona?
FOR SOME REASON THIS CHAMPION GIVES ME NIMONA VIBES LOL
she realy make me think of nimona
Absolutely love Briar and cant wait to main her
He had a girl with nice feet and he ran from her. What a loser... just like me.
No os pasa que...  ✨Jinx vibes ✨
Fun fact, Briar is left-handed! In her teaser she did her handstand and cartwheel on her left side, and in this one, her primary landing and slashing hand was her left!
Can we all take a moment to appreciate not just the animation but the incredibly great uses of analogies for the gore and violence? I am really impressed!
Necrit in the psychiatrist chair after this one🤭
So another Assassin…………………Assassin supremacy continues I guess
Nimona?!
Well someone watched Nemona
Honestly, I expected something better, it's not bad... but that pink simulating blood, please....  all because of the pegi 12 and a culture where skulls and real blood,  the ones we see with a dark reddish tone, are all really bad but the lolis are fine and they move millions...  Honestly you can do much better.
i can fix her.
Eww
I think jinx has a bestie now
Jinx 2.0
I think there is an anime with (pink blood) 😑 What was it name again?
Its giving Nimona
Hey Jinx worked once before right?
She actually earned me! It's charming that she immediately recognizes the cleaning guy as her friend!
noxus Jinx 😂
finally, my girlfriend reveal 😍
Maybe, rework yone please
Look I get that league and riot itself is a broken mess most of the time as their a company that just admitted their only goal is money and making a quality game comes second to them, but don’t any of you DARE judge their animation team cause they always go CRAXY
0:58 nice touch with the ping sounds
Her feet live on in this cinematic.
Pog
Will be a cool champ but if I’m honest, the ‘vampire jungler’ had me hoping for something a bit more dark/scary and less comical.
i want the be that guy ngl
GUYS GUYS GUYS HEAR ME OUT   *I CAN FIX HER*
Is this the announcement of vlad 2.0?
I love her so much!!!
No one... Not one person... LITERALLY NO ONE...  Riot Animation Crew: ... ... *LET'S BREAK THE INTERNET AGAIN*
Nimona Who?
Soooooo……. Warwick’s gf?
Is that a lvl 1 gyat?
Nimona that's you?
built like an IV bag 😂
Why censor de violence?
Someone on the Riot team definitely watched Nimona.
Animation slaps as per usual from the amazing team. However y'all gotta fire whoever made the splash art
So in her feral form everything is food but chained is back to friendly please don't eat me mode
Built in counter heal and self healing, dash Point and click stun, additional heal and wave clear, take less dmg+qyianna ult, aoe fear😅😅😅😂😂😂
Yesyesyes, crazy jinx 2.0
reminds me a little bit of painwheel from skullgirls
It's Jinx the cannibal
Again I'm saying this, Riot good animation company but very bad game company
"*gasp escape buddy! *growl"  How can she turn from creepy to hilarious haha
"Who wants to finally add rex." Intern then replies. "Make Rex an egirl."
This is.... Unironically a great way of just giving us a straight up vampire, like literally theres no real subversion in her design but I guess the story can be where it is
"Escape buddy, I'm stuck!"     I like the Campion. I find her unique
Hehe
ㅈ간지
Oh great, another dash champ
The 34 is gonna go crazy with this one
Another champion with 5 dashes resets selfheal and shield? yay so unusual
Someone's been watching Nimona.
Thats so cute
are thoseee fruit ninja references?
Can we please stop getting more assassins ffs .
Nice feet
So, Sylas+Jinx+Vlad?
leagl
Anyone having Nimona vibes, just a bit more violent and bloody? Loving it
"You think I'm crazy? You should see my sister." -Evelynn
This champion should've been such a W if her splash art wouldn't have her be happy innocent loli
Rioters watched the episode where Carrie possessed Gumball and made this champ
Pero sie dta está sacada de la peli esa rara no?
After a really long time im actually hyped for a new champion release! Riot animation team delivers yet again yet another amazing cinematic.. looking forward to play her in rift!
We need some escape buddy lines in there
ok hear me out
0:14 Wow this new champ looks great. I wonder if he uses an odd weapon like Jax?
Warwick has a friend
Funny thing is I'm not a league of legends fan, but I love her already and I want more of her.  I'll be ur friend Briar! Just pls dont eat me. 😅
I hope she can be in legend of runeterra game add her please riot
love the arcane style in the new champions cinematics latelly
I love her
Briar and Jinx are gonna be friends
Uhh smash
Damm the guards got pinged for not ganking
Finally the true cinematic of the year 2023🧐
1:24 cant wait to hear her champion theme, its gonna go crazy
When you have to keep things pg13
I really like this champ! While there may not be a lot of "depth" to Briar (honestly, not every character has to be a novel's worth of lore anyhow), there's a lot of little details that make her design pretty neat, especially with how they've incorporated her pillory into it. The cute-feral-vampire look is super fun, and I think her outlook on life is pretty unique, for what her archetype is-- It's nice to see a monster character not blame themselves for being a monster, you know?
Riots way of censoring the true horrors of League of Legends. It's like if Spider-Verse or Nimona directed a fight in Warhammer lol.
its like nimona and jinx had a baby
Noxian Jinx, time to join another crazy girl fanclub
hear me out tho what that tounge do
cringe
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ❤
I wanna be her friend (in game)
I love the visuals on this one, it's really stunning
i love her
It literally reminds me of tai lung because she somehow escapes even with all the restraints keeping her completely immobilized she still escapes a heavily guarded facility
Finally an interesting champ, I haven't been impressed with any since Seraphine
0:59 adc who see his supp running and then die by briar berserk mode
Even though I stopped playing League, Briar is still pretty cool. She _does_ have a bit of overlap with her personality/vibe with Jinx...but I'm okay with it.
She needs correction and mating press 😭😭😭💢💢💢
The animation team have someone "feet on face" desire
Nimona Vibes
what a trash champ
When you have the munchies and don't know where to go You chase your Hunger Buddy and where there's food, they'll know!
this is why you always respect the janitorial staff
I only met her for 2 minutes, but if something happens to her I will kill everyone in this room and then myself
would
Looked good, but why did she need to talk? We already have Jinx. Don't need Jinx 2
I haven't been this excited for a champion since jhin. I really hopes she comes to WR
Nimona vibes
dont let me down rule34
She's gurl dinner Jinx
That's Jinx if she was Warwick and from Noxus.
MORE CHARACTERS MORE LORE!!!! FEEED ME RIOT FEED ME FUN LITTLE FANATASY STORIES.
Oh god it's Nimona's Noxian sister
Ninoma ???
0:59 bros really said "?" "?"
Jinx's 3rd sister
She can fix me
Riot animation never ceases to impress me
I can tell that her Rule 34 is going to be popular
those ping sounds at 0:58 lmao
Nimonaaa with hobie animation style
Crazier than Jinx, nice...
THAT WAS INDEED FUN!!!
would
To really bring out Briar's violent and brutal nature, the scene could use some realistic blood instead of going for a more playful Danganronpa style. This would make the whole vibe much creepier and less funny. By showing the violence in a more raw and intense way, the audience would definitely feel the seriousness of Briar's character and the fierce hunger driving them.
She kind of looks like Tiny Tina
She kind of looks like Tiny Tina
I though it was shaltear from overlord hahahah
I'll have a feeding frenzy on them feet ngl.
Step on me please
Heavy Nimona vibes and I love it
If Fruit Ninja were a League character.
I wish they would have just made her the freak gnoll thing, not a new thing for discord kitten weirdos to make their profile pic
Why does her face look so drastically different? This and the splash art look like 2 different characters.
Why no blood? they censored everyhting
Jinx upgrades?
I see a younger, feral Noxian version of Sylas and I am HERE FOR IT
Yawn
Nimona vibes
Tai lung has  changed a lot since the last time he escaped 😂😂😂
This goes HARD
I need her whistle to be in her soundtrack
Toga-chan vibes..
LMAO THE PING 😂😂😂
Man I like feet
is this just Nimona  ripped and edited to fit League?
zuado e mal feito, igual o jogo.
Like the design, do wish the voice was a bit rougher and scarier to sell the "misunderstood thing we fear" harder. Her soft side is fine but her Agro state should be as different as gnar is to MEGA GNAR.
The animation team at riot is incredible.
Goofy ahh
So Jinx captured by the Black Rose?
Anyone else kinda get some Nimona vibes from the video?
League of Legends once more proving that they’re just a media company that happens to have some game in their portfolio
Why is she wearing shoes. I saw a teaser where it was only her feet. I am disappointed
I ship her and Escape Buddy
Nimona XD
mating press. NOW. GET PREGNANT GET PREGNANT GET PREGNANT
Definitely seems like there's some inspiration drawn from Nimona here, love it!
Це виглядає офігезно
I love how she instantly goes your my escape buddy 😂
Riot watched Nimona and said " we can make a champion out of this"
stop making champs fix all the old ones.
Another stupid dash dash dash champ and egirl ofc
Necrit would be happy
Huge Nimona vibes
Lack of feet downvoted
This animation reminds me sooooo much of the movie Nimona!!! ❤❤
Animatiors been watching Nimona on repeat :D
Borderka nowym championem, nice try
Bet.... So I won't get eaten if im her escape buddy ? Nice!
00:35 nobody's talking about this sick bass line ? 🤘 TUDUDUM TUDUDUM TUDUDUM TUDUDUM
new champ?
Add another to the Roster of Crazy chick who will instantly get a lot of R34 art!!!!!
I bet her and jinx would be great friends
Nooooice.
Am i the only one getting massive arcane vibes from this
Shalltear Bloodfallen coded
I can fix her
…-sigh- am I gonna get back into league after years of not playing, all for the weird fish/goblin girl? Maybe 😒
SHE IS TOO HOT!!!!!!!!! MAKE HER ACTUALLY SCARY PLZ AND THANKYOU!!!!!!!!!!!
She reminds me so much of Nimona in this trailer.
The Gorillaz called, they want their design back.
Jinx and her would get along so well.
I loved the animation and the slightly more explicit way of showing the rawness of the violence, since the game is supposed to be for teenagers and adults and not for children.
They gave her Nimona vibes haha
I can fix her
So basicaly Sett, Jinx, Warwick and Gnar combined.
No feet ? Dislike
man i love nimona
POV: When you're playing fruit ninja
Nice use of the Alert sounds.
what is this? i mean  a new garbage champ?
Someone on the team seems to have watch Nimona XD
I was hoping she would be a bit more unsettling or horrific.
think im in love
Looking at the original original painting: "Isn't she a loli?"
kinda like the vibe of it. a bit similar to nimona.
ooohhhhhhhhh another anime character what original.
ngl that ping caught me off guard
Nimonan't(?
This makes me crave for Arcane 2
200 years
The Cinamatic looks amazing, but honestly killed the hype for the character for me. Felt like a jinx clone that has a rage mode. Was hoping a hungry pyscho like WW, feeds.
Giving me heavy Tai Lung prison escape vibes
When I imagine a vampire who's been denied blood for years, I think of a feral beast that's barely a person. Not a kid with anger management issues.  She's not nearly insane enough for what she's supposed to be.
feet
DID ANYONE NOTICE THE PINGING SOUND AT 0:59 LMFAO
I already love that girl <3
im just here for the feet 👍
you know, taking Little Tina from borderlands and making it into lol char is kinda meh
Animation is kinda childish but cool, the champion is cringe
animation remind me of nimona
NImona+Gawa Gura
Ugh
It's giving Nimona
Wow, a loli vampire...
Oh great... another crazy
Her voice sounds like jinx from arcane !! And i love it
PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP PLAP GET PREGNANT GET PREGNANT GET PREGNANT GET PREGNANT GET PREGNANT SHES SO TIGHT 😭😭😭😭😭😭💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢💢
FEET!
anyone else get Nimona vibes? Like Nimona if she was a bloodthirsty villian that actually kills. I love that ahaha!
This is a really good character trailer. I love how stylistic it is so that it can hide the obvious gore that Briar would cause.
im guessing a jg or top lane bruiser
Damnit! This one of the best things I've seen lately!
Nimona vibes
Se ve bonita tiene una pinta de lokura con ternura xD
This is giving me Nimona vibes. Can’t wait to see her in game
I'm getting some "nimona" vibes here   (Except for the eating part)
i see some nice Nimona/Puss in boots 2 references
Im so disappointed by her personality
"I can fix her."
they covered her feet xD
Her design looks like Warwick
at least they cut out the jump scare in the youtube version. I dont know why there is a jump scare in a game for 12+ years old
I can fix her🥵
Nimona aura
Briar in the splash art and in the cinematics are different
Rammus : Ok
fusion de vladimir  y jinx
Ah yess.... A loli vampire girl with wild personality
Kinda gives me Nimona vibes with that artstyle
Ill take this instead of this year's cinematic
I can fix her.
The fact that the ping noise is used.
I just imagine her dragging that dude around doing what dogs do to their young
You know I'm actually happy with how briar turned out
clearly stolen from overlord...
Wait, Sultur? Is this a Sultur origin from LoR?
YOW the animation just reminds me of Nimona its soooo cool
This ain't it chief
That ping sound gives me PTSD
It's going to feel so good when you land a Sett w on her , just like when Jotaro caved DIO's skull with his stand
Can't wait for necrit to do a video on this and tracks down where she was being held
She's adorable
oh cool, jinx but melee, was hoping she would a quiet creepy character and not just jinx again, disappointed
Riot saw nimona and liked it so much that they made her a champion
New Nimona trailer goes hard 🔥🔥🔥
I've only had Briar for a day and a half, but if anything happened to her, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself
Nimona inspiration i see
Makes me think of Nimona weirdly enough
Why is Briar a woman? Nobody wants to play female champs bro. Stop making female characters. Make more manly champs please. My fkn God. Jesus Christ man.
I can't belive they bring Nimona to LOL.
I can fix her
Is it only me or this champ looks alot like Shalltear from overlord?
Super creative! What a treat to the eyes!
0:58 THE PING SOUND PLSSS- Also, am i the only one who tought of nimona at the start?
League is just better!
Not league using the danger pings at 1:00. 😂
Shes such a baddie i cant stop rewatching
Okay someone watched Nimona
the ping at 0:58 lmao
I can fix her...
so at the end LoL its like to play with barbies, all the last champions are females :/
Makes me think of Nimona
thanks for fiddlesticks 2 my frends
God i just love the Arcane style,her gorkiness,skill showcase throughout the video and personality 🥴 gj rito i hope you don't downgrade her so much so that i can main her and please nerf other unnecessary champs like irelia or volibear etc
What theeee...I mean word
At least we know she don’t just eat everything
Amazing!
her 2nd form is like shalltear's (overlord)
That’s a lot of dashes
Never forget they use IA to do the 10 year anniversary for LATAM, but have the budget to animate the feet loli.
This cinematic reminded me a lot of Blue Sky's recent animated movie Nimona with how artsy the violence looked. Another amazing cinematic by the animation team at Riot
Nimona Vibes, I'm already in love with her 🫵🗿
ate
Why is her frenzy, supposedly a violent occurrence, presented in such a cartoonish way? I don't understand the thought process... Is it fear of  scaring away a younger audience ? or maybe Chinese weird rules regarding fictional works again?
To me she remind me more of shalltear bloodfallen (lamprey) when she is berserk.
vibes of nimona
The whole "shes got blood" thing gives me Himiko Toga vibes from MHA with a dash of Nimona.
Yooooo Where's Arcane season 2 at!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Its giving Nimona 😂 I LOVE IT!!!
was this internal Rito cinematic or outsourced? either way it was great!
So ... they knew EXACTLY what she was able to do and she stayed in a normal cell able to move?  And no blood mage in the team to try to subdue\weak her?  Was a question of days before she run away.
nimona?
Someone liked the Nimona movie, I see XD
Giving me Nimona vibes with the art style
I like how she started playing fruit ninja mid fight
Cinematic is great! Sadly, this was not quite what I was hoping for when I heard "female vampire champion with unsatiable bloodlust". Oh well.
you guys remember ww cinematic? yeah, that was peak league back then...
The ? Ping noises on the guards😂😂
She's absolutely adorable!
love her 💞
I want Briar to sit on my face tf
Colette from Brawl Stars
"Shalltear Bloodfallen Cinematic"
As for me it looks like riot was definitely inspired by nimona
Shes jinx in powder foam i swear to god
Ah i miss league so much. 2 years not playing 😭
The animation feels like I'm watching nimona
Seems to be as out of place as seraphine
Imagine how cool this would have been if it wasn't all leaked
Jinx got a friend now
i love this animation
looks like nimona. . .
cool how you can hear the caution ping sound at 0:58
nah thats just milo
Nimona esque
gives me nimona vibes!! i absolutely loved the cinematic and animation style choice. i thought i was going to get disappointed but honestly? i’m beyond surprised.
Loved the question mark pings. Nice touch
The animation is crazy
@ :30 nobody got the finding Nemo reference? “ fishes are friends not food” however Blair says “ that’s my friend and your food”
Yup im going to instalock her in blick pick all the way to lvl 7
Nemona vibes
Where's 4K graphic though
Am I the only one that was reminded of Nimona after watching this?
Aww, so... It's been a long time since Rito created a hotty, and instead they created a lunatic like Jinx.... Sad, sad... Only really like 4 hotties in the game, Ahri, Sona, Miss Fortune, and.... Urgot.
must be hella broken if they had remove base hp regen from her
diooooooos
i can fix her
nimona would get along well with her
BIG Nimona energy, I love it
Remind me of nimona
Crazy girl! New main? 🤭
Imagine if they spent 1/4th the effort from this cinematic into the LLA 10 year celebration animation instead of making an AI mess lol
Someone liked Nimona
They prepare this champ for counter the perma ban of Naafiri
i would give everyone single person in this animation a godamn cookie personally wtf was that
can't wait to use her
bruh wtf, riot rlly copied nimona 💀
Sakin beyler ayakkabının önü kapalı değil, sonunda...
i loved this till it went full manga
Scape buddy! she won me there, great writing
.....huh. Somebody even more crazy than Jinx.  You don't see that every day.
im sry but briar isnt a vampire to me . where is a the bat transformation. thats  a main vampire thing , they also dont use wepeons , when i think of a vampire i think of dracula or anyone from castlevania.  like just cause u scream and drink blood doesnt mean u are a vampire she more seems like blade, has vampire things but isnt a full on vampire,
Personality feels half-assed made, or quickly thrown together on short notice. Why is a tortured, starved, and experimented on creature so trusting, positive, and happy?
Честно? Нет. Это выглядит как новая Джинкс...
A Jinx ripoff in terms of personality except being a literal vampire and melee.  EDIT: The animation feels... VERY Jinx. How original, Riot.
Now, hear me out…  I can fix her.
Feet where?
Rule34 Artists: I/We are also your friend 😊😏
so basically jinx of noxus eh?
Why are you running meme 🤣
At first i though i was Zombie Jinx 😄
literally warwick
The embodiment of Riots Hunger for money
Nimona that you?
Nimona,if she was an vimpire
Shalltear bloodfallen in league of legend ? I'm for it !
hahaha i like this kid
Waaait.... is her va the jinx from arcane?
Why does her soundtrack sound so much like golden winds theme
Oh hi Powder
she will probably have a gnar similar mecanic also every body is trying to be into the spider verse
Surprised they didn’t show off her feet as much as they did in her leaked splash art 😂😂😂 rito said lemme get the foot people rq watch
Like the teen punk. Feels oddly nostalgic…
So disgusting gamedes.
The question ping sounds is just spot on! 😂
good animation
i hate this animation style sorry
Where are those guys who wants to lick her feet now?
This guy is in prison and has handcuffs so he's kind of like crazy vampire Silas.
0:59 those ingame alert sounds actually made me laugh
Maaaan! I cant wait until season 2 of Arcane.
Riot is so unmatched when it comed to these cinematics i would love go see this char in arcane this universe is just so dam good
she couldve gone actually berserk with her ulti like mundo
Someone call Ains sama! Shalltear lost it again😂
Bro she caught me off guard while I was listening to chill music and then she suddenly appeared from the Prison door giving me a jumpscare xD
Man... Now Im hungry for some grub too
Is that Nimona? 😂
Ok, so the Budget went here it seems. lol
Bro💀
Jinx, Zoe, Annie and Briar deserves the 4 horsegirls of the apocalypse skinline 😁😆
This... entire thing was repulsive.
She's basically a cute girl who turns yandere
Great animation! Can’t wait to get one shot by her
oh yeah i'd let her chop me up into little pieces
Gz Rito
For those who thought jinx was crazy, this one is another level
Jinx finally has someone as crazy as she is lmao
We need the full song 😢
Almost looks like a Gorillaz colab
On my way to look for people saying that it should've been them when she was on  top of that guy.
Jinx 2
So basically: her vampire theme is about using health as resource like vladimir, having built-in omnivamp in her abilities her passive is a revamp of warwicks passive her q is a pantheon w her w is a ravenous hydra with a re-activation of a warwick q her e is a mixture of aurelion sol's and quinoa's ult with built-in omnivamp and her r is a more agressive vex ult but without shield.  so.. Vladimir decided to have a child with Warwick but Asol, Pantheon, Quiyana and Vex wanted to be part of the fun.  but hey, the design feels somewhat unique, like a female adaptation of sylas in a silent hill game.
vampire tiny tina got it
mommy?
Nimona2 trailer
Nah are u thinking what im thinking ?
Rule34 will go crazy on her
Yes.
Nemona?!?! Jk, I reckon they'd be best friends tho.
1:22 Briar whistling the "Keepers of the Gate" from DUSK?
yey champ for pedos and perverts
So we have a gnar/jinx/vlad
Feels like someone was watching Nemona
Better than the yearly cinematic
she reminds me of nemona
i know she is besties with nimona
aka Shalltear Bloodfallen
If Jinx and Morbius had a kid.
nice another crazy girl xd
it's a busting feeding frenzy, stay out of the waterrrrrr
the fight animation feels inspired my nimona and i am living for it
kids are playing this game. don'T you think it's a little creepy for them? :D
ultra cringe, but great animation as always
Someone watched Nemona
If Jinx is so great, why isn't there a Jinx 2?
Kinda reminds me of Nimona.
I can see how Nimona influenced the art style of this cinematic. Very metal 🤘🏾
YESSSSSS LET'S GO BERSERK!!!!!!!!
the animation giving me Nimona vibes
Oh yeah Jinx would love this girl. New best friend let's goo
Hmmm maybe its just bc I'm a jinx main but I don't like how similar they are in personality, voice, & aesthetic. At least in animation. The way it stylizes into what she sees instead of reality, not like her style.
... okay Riot, real talk: how many of your developer staff had watched Nimona? That's nothing to be ashamed of. I just won't to know the percentage.
Animation is amazing. But dude why she sounds in her crazy form like an angry teen ??? Where is the horror RIOT ???
She really said Friends are not food 😂😂😂
this animation feels like nemora
she reminds me of shalltear bloodfallen from overlord
Will he be friends with amumu?
Just my type fr
Anyone else getting Nimona vibes for some reason? 🤔
Also wasn't she  suppose to be blind?  but she sees the guy just fine? wouldn't be a character development error then 0:13 ?
THE FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
Across the Nimonaverse looking good
Is she blind ?
Soo... another champ with a dash? And a frenzy mode?
It’s giving Nimona
ahhhh warwick + jinx
The vibe of the champion reminds me of Nimona.
Shalltear Bloodfallen looking good.
Bro is so lucky
she really reminds me of nimona
Vampire cunny lets goooooo!!!
Nimona Is that you?
See? THIS is why people get mad at you for Feeding!
Okay, now I'm going to want fan art of her and the dude having an ice cream together lol, damnit riot
Jinx
Why does this feel like Nimona? xD
Briar from Arcane!
I both love and hate this character. I love the design, her frenzy, and all that... But she isn't actually a creepy character. At all. I was seriously hoping for another horror champion like post-rework Fiddlesticks but we got "vampire" Jinx instead.
Is Brunch that French studio that just absolutely never misses with their animations? Cause if so, add another zinger to their ever growing list of hits.
i heard people had a problem with her voice. what problem they have? come on dont "look" for problems.
Poor choice for a voice
Freckles 😢
Dont be scared my friends, Gangplank can one-shot everything. So we can deal with she.
Rule34 on the end part of the clip.
Sick dude, sick.
so um. uuuhhh... the toes are back
No one hears the Minecraft door sound effect? Just me?
Of course she’s quircky can’t just be a dark character
dev team took one look at Nimona and said "yea"
Disappointing design and voice--I was hoping for a mature vampire jungler not Jinx
you guys promised gothic loli vamprie, but instead gave us gremlin teenager in Arcane stylistic
>:3 RAWR XD
SO THE VERY POWERFUL CREATED WITH DARK AND BLOOD MAGIC EXPERIMENT WAS INPRISONED IN A REGULAR PRISON? ARE U TREEPING? WHERE DARK ROSE MAGICAL PRISON COME ON
Nah bro you didn't just make her barefoot and put her in bondage 💀💀💀💀💀
Great visuals for the cinematic, but I hate her personality.
0:59 bruh even the ping sounds
This style reminds me of that Netflix show Nimona
Arcane type of animation always is insane
big tiny tina vibes from this one
i've been disapointed before, was execting a lot, don't say it's bad, just saying it's really differant from what i was expecting, hope to see something more of this champ in the future, as the design posses a lot of potential.
my boy warwick curled up in a corner
Nimona
Shalltear Bloodfallen Join to League Of Legends!
what's this music genre? some kind of metal? can someone tell?
i was just waiting for her to shout "I WILL NOT YEALD" when she transformed
Briar, The Vore Fetish
nemona flashbacks
Was that helmet bro?
Its like someone crossed Nimona with Jinx
nimona came to league of legends💀💀☠️☠️☠️
Love the Arcane-like animation
Finally a cinematic where the innocent guy isn't murdered
The guardswoman at the beginning has strong "Let me see what you have. A knife! No!" energy.
shalltear inspiration is heavy XD
the entire community be like "i can fix her"
30 Ağustos Türkiye bağımsızlık Zafer gelişim günümüz Bayramı kutlu olsun Yunanistanı yendik topraklarımızı koruduk kazandık kırmızı en sevdiğimiz renk mavi sevmeyiz heryerde bayrağımızı dalgalandırırız herkese kendimizi tanıtırız konserlerde bayrağımızı açarız her ülkede rahatça gezeriz Türkler çok mutlu böyle kanlı şampiyona sahibiz bayrağımız kanı simgeler seni seviyorum Riot Games 29 Ekim Türkiye kuruluş tarihi Lonia şampiyon bekleriz sana gençliğimizi verdik League Of Legends Arcane Jinx çocukluğu ve Mylo sinyal gönderme  ❤️🇹🇷⚔️🇬🇷💙 🇹🇷❤️🇪🇺💚🇬🇷
Bro She is just playing Fruit Ninja IRL XD
Yeah that's definetly NOT Nimona ...
Hear me out
It's a dark Nimona... 😅
kind of feels like a different version of jinx
Smash, Next.
Anyone else getting Nimona vibes. (If you watched that movie)
Next great champ and design and this video is masterpiece too. Finally we are not getting more seraphines, zeris and these boring Chinese champs
release this champion on wildrift with naafiri🤭please
Thought this was Arcane 2 teaser
Now this is what I'm talking about! 👌
animation team needs such a huge raise omfg
Ok so basically she got Darius' passive, her Q is Pantheon's W, her W is Warwick's W, her E is Megagnar's R, her R is Vex's R and uses her restraints as weapons just like Sylas, very original
Move over Jinx. There's a new face of chaos and cartoon violence in Runeterra.  For serious, Briar is giving me major Tiny Tina vibes.
Another wannabe Jinx kiddo champ so booring... Riot really messed up already!
Collection of crazy females is getting bigger adn im happy for that
ummmm im so lost in this character i cant wait to play her XD
wow look at her! Quem ela pensa que é, o Dracula ? Eu acho que nao!
Give me the champion them. Now.
So we went from dommy mommy design to loli foot fetish to this abombination.
I AM SPEAKING FOR EVERYONE NOW, i wish the team had the creative liberty to use actual gore
is she imprisoned in... Torghast?
no  way they made Jinx 2
OMG THE PUNK AESTHETIC ON THIS IS INSANELY GOOD!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!
Everything about the trailer is amazing except the fact that it's just Jinx again
Jinx knock-off? Riot running out of ideas
That dude definitely need a new pair of underpants.
Lmao this man is about to get the treatment of a lifetime thanks to sfm… I want patiently my brothers for the content.
Animation team goes crazy!!!!
Is it weird that I hope Briar and escape-buddy can somehow become good friends? 🥺  Also, I find it interesting that escape-buddy somehow had the speed and reflexes to outrun some of her attacks.
sylas but from noxus
SHES SO COOL
Can't believe someone at Riot watched Nimona once then decided to make a new champ about it
As usual 10 thousand dash's
Supprised to see no "I can fix her" comments
Now we got vampire Jinx, when do we get vampire Vi?
Hi Nimona! :D
Isn't that Jinx voice actress
i wanna be friend
That familiar art style.. Is this the same french animation and art team that worked on Arcane?
wow another quirky, over tuned goth female champion..
oh wow they watched the new Nimona movie!
dang jinx might have lost her title as the most craziest champ
finally someone matches jinx's energy
Oooh, so that's where the pillory comes into play, she's hungry 24/7 the pillory is so that she can have at least some self control while still being able to break it, I think she'd need to slaughter a few dozen or so first before she can gradually regain some sanity back so she can seal herself back
Briar and Nimona would be a great team up.
I swear they could've made a short of her cutting her nails and it'd be viral with over 5million views in 24 hours
Cool! Mileena is now in League of Legends.
Sadly no more feet
As an adc player - I am wetting my pants from this cinematic.
Well, I guess I was hoping for her to be more serious and dark. Buuut they gave her the silly cringe cRaZy GiRl voice that Jinx has. Bleh...
Dear god after arcane that is the kind of writing you are coming out with?
Can't wait for her theme to drop.
Shalltear Bloodfallen anybody?
Borderlands vibes... Ilike it Bv
I was curious and looked at the naughty website to see if people are really that no life. Theres already 65 posts. 65. Its been 4 hours. Please.
Well…someone saw nemona
Pretty much Nimona
The art style is so nice actually, I love this! Also, I swear, with every bit of content we're getting, Im more and more mad about the leaks, I think this reaching us "as intended" would have been so much more effective 😩
She's playing Fruit Ninja IRL
Nimona
i can fix her
The funniest censorship I've seen in a while. Escape Buddy got lucky the bloodlust ended in time or he was a goner as well!
Looks like Vladimir and Jinx had a kid...then Sylas and Katarina raised it.
I've loved her design from day 1, and even though I was hoping for a different personality, I don't hate what we got. My only complaint is her voice. If it was more feral/growly/raspy to contrast her bubbly personality and add a bit more creepiness to her I think that would've been better. Just my 2 cents
alguna desarrollador le gusto la peli de nimona
Nimona vibes
wow i lovvve her
Nimona vibes
nimona vibes
Extreme violent and extreme bi polar  tendency good vibes gothic vampiric horror
This scene reminds me of thw across the spiderverse
would be cooler if she was drenched in blood by the end of the cinematic
league of Crazy Women.
Thought we would get another majestic vampire but we get another Jinx/Zeri/Vex kind of character...
Now Jinx has a friend 🤣
Chinese friendly product censorship.
this whole thing reminds me of nimonia
Interesting to release this the same time as "Song of Nunu". Thematic clash is good  Her voice reminds me a LOT of Jinx... which is ok but idk. Kind of wish she was more frightening as opposed to playful or feisty.   I think she seems pretty cool we'll see how she is in the game, I do like how she can form those little weights apparently as she wants to.
she inspired by shalltear or what?
Animation style is really giving Nimona
"HAII ^_^"
Sooo... Vladimir fluffing Jinx is canon now?
Devs after they see niamona
I really love the art style!!! And the music complements well with the slice and dice animation
So they casually decided to bring shalltear bloodfallen in the game
tai long wants a fistbump
the implied gore haha nice touch
She’s got that jinx and Warwick vibe, love it
i can fix her
That's her new buddy!!!
smash. next champ pls.
Someone in the animation team watched Nimona... Sick.
I can relate. I really like food too.
Not the personality I expected.
Not the most interesting design, we've covered this quirky crazy girl archetype already. However, Riot knows they can capitalize on the easy-to-please weeb community, and here we are.
0:58 somebody spammed a ping bruh💀
"Run, she was fed!" - Soon in all SoloQs.
Ah so Vampire Jinx, got it. It's interesting she's the first champion you voluntarily lose control of.
Patas
did roit rep off Overlord anime wtf
I thought she would have the same personality as Shalltear from Overlord but I guess not.
I love her
best trailer ever
Imagine what an very intresting she have interaction with champions Like fidlesticks
None pulling me out
So, after years getting more and more "other lux" champions, we now get an "other jinx" one... NICE!
Lmao she sounds like Harley Quinn and Jinx all in one XD
This is giving off nemona vibes
Is it just me, or Blair witch her feet exposed was a referance to Avatar The Last airbender and charackter Toph Beifong?
many people wanted to be her friend ... screaming "that should be me not him!" ( ͡͡ ° ͜ ʖ ͡ °)
she giving jinx vibes...
"-in collaboration with BRUNCH Eddy"
I love everything about her ♥
Briar feet supremacy
You can tell they watched spiderverse
Bro, I was looking for a popcap fish game but found this instead.
Jinx and her can be real good friends! 😂😂
r34 artists rubbing their hands
so... its just Jinx but with blood instead of explosive huh creative
yay another hot champ
She reminds me of my ex. Minus the calabalism part.
ah yes, crazy, just my type
the league devs watched nimona I see
why does she sound like jinx?
If you all wanted to make a edgy jinx just had to say so 😂
Love her but not a fan of how much she sounds like Jinx
I wonder when we're getting new episodes on Netflix
I'm sorry...did they just ripped off "Nimona"? 🤔🧐
I think we found a new bestie for Jinx
Something tells me that both the champion and the animation of this was inspired by Nimona...
hm why is it again this comic style and not the cinematic style from the awaken or the fall videos
She's so Nimona
Jinx is going to get a new best friend.
Honestly she looks older here than her splash art
She is so crazy... I love her <3
she looks like tiny tinda and act like her too
Another champ with multiple dashes or crowd control
Riot finally figuring out you can make the most ultra giga cool woman champ without making her look like a manequin who made 175491 plastic surgery
the dialog is extremely outdated.
Okey. a champ with a lot dashed... I assume
I can fix her
I can fix her.
The community will definitely not take out of context the last part where Briar is ontop of the janitor saying "¿wasn't that fun?" and the guy just gasps and moans to then lay back down completely gassed out!!1!!
Looks good but the animation method used lately (e.g., the Naafiri animation) gives me a headache/eyeache.  (Too many skipped frames?)
sun plus vampire = die
cringe
She actually rly reminds me of nimona from that Netflix movie
jinx 2.0
She has boots now
So the Pillory appears to be runeforged like Riven’s blade, if I had to guess on how it worked, there’s an internal timer on the pillory’s runes, and the Pillory itself can have the timer set as well as the mechanism released remotely.  That leads me to think that someone may have helped her get out, someone with access to the controls in the pillory
I'm getting Nimona vibes tbh and I like that chaotic  energy.
Escape buddy? Please don’t die
I just hear Jinx if you close your eyes.
To me this is a 100% fail on making a "terrifying unhinged" champ she's just jinx but a vampire?? Not even a vampire just a little girl NEXT
not bad
This is surprisingly cringe
I just wish this vampire had actual vampire traits, shes just a yandere with a vampire slapped on it, no bat wings, no bat form, no blood sucking just a crazy yandere that stabs, I, guess her W does have  a recast chomp, no blood magic either, they couldve done so much more with this concept, its a cool champion just not a vampire one
She reminds me of nimona a lot
Shalltear, is that you?
Biggest dissapointment this year by far
I LOVE HER!
i love how shes genuinely a nice person, but was turned into a monster by her inhumane conditions
I love that League is getting back to creating true monster characters and if you have insecurities about Briar, never play another game rated above E for the rest of your LIFE!!! 🤣🤣🤣😈🩸 she's here to make friends, but anyone that hurts her or them are FOOD!!!
Telong
briar's character design is so cool
Jinx 2
The tone of this kinda ruins the fear in the client teaser.
jinx 2.0
folks gonna freak when they see 0:32
Its if jinx and vladimir would have a baby
Gorillaz finally entered the roster
Nimona its you?
Friend dont need to dead. Food 100% dead. 😂
Another goofy ahh anime looking champion added in league. Thank you riot for making the game even worse than it is right now
What happened to evelynn??
Someone at riot watched overlord
Can you please make it so when Jax encounters Briar he says: "Do you want me to show you my real weapons?" ;)
Oh, look, Nimona on League of Legends. . .
So the animation team really watched Nemona and said “oh yeah we can rip that off.”
So she's noxian jinx
pp hard
Nimona, but now a vampire
Really cool, reminds me a lot of nimona
This looks fantastick!!!
Am I tripping, or she looks and sounds like Jinx?
Ngl it’s just nemona in league
why she exist when we have Warwick ? she was can be one of Vladimir Follovers from LOR. Why we got litle girl Ww ?😩
Sooo vampire jinx?😅
nimona releasing again? dope.
She reminds me of nimona so much because of the rock music playing in the background while shes fighting the soldiers and the art style while she does so it's alike to nimonas artstyle, riot must've loved nimona and I really can't blame them I did too! I hope we can see more of her janitor friend too!
Pls dont have overloaded kit Pls dont have overloaded kit Pls dont have overloaded kit
I can't wait to play Fruit Ninja in game!
yo who's her va? cuz i can definitely hear jinx va
cool girl.
this has Nimona vibes all over love it :D
Wow is that Nimona
peak design
Very interesting
She's basically if Nimona went off the deep end
Warwick + vladimir
At least the cinematic was made before the feet nerfs
jinx 2.0
Strong nimona vibe from her
Wow... just wow
okay, she honestly just feels like a crazier jinx
Holly Balls I loved it.
Shalltier. Riot lo haces de nuevo :´V
oh woooow, Rito, you made jinx into a vampire? SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO original... -_-  couldntn you just made her....idk, more animalistic? inhumane? manipulative? anything but a Jinx clone?
that guy has quite the new friend
Such a beautiful cinematic, bravo 👏
She's such an unhinged little goblin, I love it.
Pinky
ThaiLung 2.0
Genial, otro champ roto
Amumu has been waiting his entire life for a friend...
Why is jinx a vampire now
So nemona as a vampire
I love Nimona
Ah yes... Riot also saw Nimona I guess
Feeet😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩🥶🥶🥶🥵🥵😫🤑🤑
0:57 The question mark ping is wild
the new janitor champion reveal is fire 🔥🔥
The graphics remind me a lot like Jinx, along with her voice and crazyness.
So she basically has Shalltear Bloodfallen vampire transformation ; Thank you Riot!
The animation isss crazy good!! also... re-using jinx concept (cause she got the community's love) but make it goth
is that jinx's voice actress?
So it's jinx 2
This remind me of a Netflix movie eh...
hear me out
i see a copy paste ... briar -> tai lung
Dear Riot, Jinx would like her identity back
imagine her and jinx being friends lol
more and more dashes.....
how much time it takes to Riot to realize that they make weird weapons i mean we already have K'Sante,Nilah,Gwen and probably others.This one have weird weapons too,at least she looks nice.
okey... i love this
I can fix her
Did somebody said nimona?
Let me see them dogs guuurl
Thats an actual good design!
One word: Horrible.
Jinx would love to play with her
feet
NGL the do not feed on the launcher jumpscared me a wee bit
It s rly cool and all but man... I hoped so much that she would not just be a jinx 2.0 I hoped for a beast and not a psycho goofy girl
I imagined something more terrifying, not a champ with marvel type of humor
Eyy she was honest about not killing her friend, that’s pretty wholesome
It seems League of Hentai has a new tab once again
Nimona's animation hurt bad, huh?
Briar looks like a combo of Shalltear + Gura .
Its Jinx pt. 2... Cant wait for the depressing backstory on this lovable marketable psychopath...
Love the art and the animation, was hoping she'd be well , not vampire jinx we already have a zany young lady buuuut now that it's here I demand they be buddies and cause mayhem together !! Also they drag good ole background character guy around the whole time assigning him thousands of names and swearing up and down they're friends
i didn't think they could do it but riot actually made a character that is even more crazy then jinx.
1:13 can she do the same thing to me??? pleaaaase
o not another balancing mess! plz riot you said you were goin to focus on balance and not new champs! nafiri was nerfed at least 10 time by now and she is still broken ! no more champs just figure balancing out ! stop buffing dmg you been doing this for 2 years.
Feeding frenzy? That's my teammates every game
Nimona, is that you?
She can go feral on me yessir!
Is this the same rioter who made sylas? Cause if so the meme of   "Creators barely disguised fetish" applies to this
vengo por las patas
👌👌
need more feet pic
cool cinematic. cool champ design, but she sounds a bit too much like Jinx...
Anything after 12 is lunch 😈🔥
Seeing a lot of Nimona similarities. Love it
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN ME, NOT HIM
She make me think of the vampire in overlord
Put her in the mobile phone zone, please🥺🥺🖤
meh, jinx clone
Ever since the cinematic disaster last year both this cinematic and the one for soul fighter have been incredible. Ty Riot
The VA is a bit unexpected... But not bad, just not "nail on the head" for me personally. Other than that Briar's design is perfect.   Maybe the VA will grow on me.  Also the music in this cinematic 10/10
Oh No, Raluca is a champion now.
Alright I'm hyped now
Someone is whistling at the end there, but it cant be swain, right??? 🤔
I’m getting the vague feeling that Briar might be slightly deranged.
Welp, she's definitely my new main
Anyone remember Ayla from Awesomenauts? Yeah, i see where they got inspiration.
Yo... new assassin!
But...where feet?
Reminds me of Shalltear from Overlord, minus the elegance when she's not in a feral, blood-hungry craze.
Idk why, but she is giving nimona vibes like okay, maybe not really, but her attitude resembles nimona kinda
When Will She be out on pbe?
I feel a normal amount abut this champ.
It's warwick but as an anime girl.
If you look closely, you can see they patched another thing up that the community called strange. See guys Riot does notice what the community hollers about and is concerned about it. Other than that gonna miss the Jordan memes
Hear me out guys I can fix her
so she's like Gnar but w/ warwick abilities; and is scary
1:16  god I wish that was me
Is that nimona art style
Cyberpunk vampire. Cringe
She protected him from guards. What a nice girlfriend he has.
I wanted more horror... But I suppose Noxus-Jinx is fine too
so this is vampire neoma?
What is with noxians champions been escape experiments
NOOOOOOO!!!! they Covered her Feet LMAO
So it's jinx 2?
someone clearly watched Nimona
wait its crazy how much this trailer reminds me of Nimona
No offense to the voice actress, but the voice really doesn't fit the character, it makes her just another crazy girl, I can't feel the hunger at all. Plus, I was expecting her to be creepy, and a bit goth.
Blood? That looks like grape juice 🍇
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER ON GREEN PAGE 💀💀💀💀
I would
0:58 omg i just realized they used the freakin retreat ping sound effect😭😭
Tai Lung's escape but with Nimona Vibes. AND I LOVE IT
Finally another champ that represents perfectly the sanity of the average league of legends player. Amazing animation tho
literally cruel
At the end, I thought he would ask her if she wants to ride him xd
They watched Nimona once 🙄
Aesthetic looks dope asf. But comparing this to Warwick trailer chase sequence with much tenser feeling and photorealistic graphics, this one seems bit lazy, although being six years later.
This feels like Jinx 2 And I love it.
Needs more feral dog energy
loving the Nimona energy in this design XD
Jinx got a haircut. Nothing original about her so far. Disappointing.
Jinx: Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!
looks like shalltear bloodfallen in  true vampire form
Wuld  be better with Buffy soundtrack
Leblanc- "If I had a nickel for every time one of our teenage supersoldier experiments broke out and went on a rampage I'd have 2 nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird it happened twice right?"
While I really enjoyed the animation, does Briar have the same voice actress as Jinx? Even if not, they sound far too alike. I thought it might be fun for her and Jinx to meet, but you'd never tell them apart.
Nice Shalltear from Overlord copy
I recorded something to Evelynn
Nimona, is it you? 😈🥲
Comic horror ? I don't think i like this but the champion seem great
So much similarities between Orin from Baldur's Gate 3
Big nimona vibes here!
Why's she wearing shoes ?
Cant wait for escape buddy to be added as a champ
tell me the animation team had watched Nimona without saying they watched nimona:
Lol reminds me of Nimona
Im sure im not the only one but i expected her voice to be creepier when i first saw her splashart, it wouldve been nice if it was somewhat creepy low voice (but not too low) and not sound like a 14 year old
I am so excited to play her! Are there any infos when she will get released? It will probably take a bit of time right?
Jinx and Evelynns love-child
We NEED to see her team up with Rell at some point to attack a Noxian stronghold or some such
0:58 When you ping your lanes the enemy JNG is on the way but they still get ganked. 😅
personality is neeko x jinx..might be fun to play but not really bringing much to the game thats unique. cute cinematic though!
I'm convinced the people in this comment section are just bots. Everyone is apparently so excited for Feet and completely ignoring the fact that she has the same personality as jinx. and the whole design is just trash.
Nimona 2 is looking amazing!
Well didn't we already had a crazy chick Rito invested on whole a lot?
Jinx 2: vampiric boogaloo looking pretty funky. Especially makes a nice change from YET ANOTHER pretty korean MMO character, not quite a full monster character but a definite step up!
She can catch my big crystally claws. Skarner is the apex predator of the jungle.
Cringe design
Real Nimona vibes, Love it
i can fix her
Least she didnt kill her new friend eh lol
So a B version of jinx
Now give us the uncensored version
See i know everybody here is saying “Jinx!” But I’m out here saying Gnar. They’d have a field day causing havoc
She just feels like another version of Jinx, pass
I am so sick of "Bloodthirsty murder but actually it's a super silly quirky random lol xD rawr!" We LITERALLY already had this exact same personality with Jinx more than a decade ago!
another jinx?
Reminds me of Nimona
i was expecting nothing and i'm still disappointed
Was cool until her transformation.  Kinda goofy imo
That's just Jinx, but vampire.. I mean, Jinx is awesome so I understand why the decided to copy their own champion but.. that's just Jinx but a vampire..
I love the animation However i do not like character design
shalltear?
animation has gone wild but why she has to looks like a child, just whyyyyyyyyyyy
vampire jinx
Nimona on drugs xD
Shalltear is that you ?
buff the feet back, ty
Noo.. it's Shoes
Does she have a billion dashes like the last twenty champions?
Ah yes. Quirky Anime girl is exactly what the first vampire in league needed
Cool, a new support
Nimoma vibes
Yay! Another champion with 60 dashes per minute, that's exactly what we needed!! 200 Years.
'Humnn... i like this one.'' Jinx
Would
Briar Cinematic: "I need more food"  Briar in Game: 0/17 report for feed.
Toes
Riot employees have a interesting foot fetish with lolis
Woww :0 Both her design and abilities look absolutely incredible and so so much fun, i love that her gameplay seems to complement her character so much. It all seems very unique and simplistic at the same time i just LOVE it!!! Cant wait to play her, thank you RIOT <3
Feeding frenzy no es un juego de pecesitos?
jinx 2 looking good
Hopefully they finally made a fun champ.
Riot: Make copy paste from Nimona.
Shalltear vibes
It feels like, they made Jinx 2.0 and it'll probably work.
So Shalltear Bloodfallen?
NOOOOOOO SHE HAS BOOTS😭😭😭
Escape buddy
Seems friendly and protecting her escape-buddy.
Never would I think Nimona and Tai Lung in the same thought space but here we are.
Is this supposed to be the “scary” champ? She looks like a mobile legends character
Thought she was supposed to be scary. Oh, nvm then.
Ok. So she seems like ww but I honestly love her hair changing reminding me of old Evelyn. Guess I got a new main.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO SHE HAS SHOES 😭😭😭
It remembers me shalltear blood fallen
Not the danger pings 😭😭
“That Janitor is definitely Stuck with Briar has Her Best Friend”! That Would Be Like Amazing 🤩
Another very cool cinematic well done rito
So she's jinx with Vlad's powers and Sylas's backstory?
Ok, who let the art directors from nimona into riots office?
Wow, thanks riot, league realy was in need of a new "monster" champion
Sorry but meh
THAT STYLE GAWDAAAAAMN
Shalltear Mode Blood Blood frenzy ? 😅
Jinx 2 Electric Boogaloo
Okay so.. the first trailer for her was.. disappointing and embarassing.. like.. really.. this one however.. OHH MY LORD.. I AM IN LOVE
Friends are not food.
No way they pulled the danger ping out at 0:58
How the duck did they make a more feral warwick, but cuter?
hrrrnnng need soft briar feet in my mouth
And twitter freaks called her a loli and the players the p word
Nimona? Dat you?
I'm really looking forward to how she looks on some sites
She wanna be Jinx sooooo bad
i still can’t see the child in her design she looks like she’s just a young adult
Wow
Garbage aesthetic.. “people loved how unhinged jinx was lets just do that again but harder!”
Wtf, this has Nimona written all over it.
Seeing this makes me want more Riot animation series, music and animation is something Riot will never stop surprising me with
soo...assassin mid? or a jungler? xd
W
this gives me tai lung escaping his prison vibes
Evil neeko
Legit nimona without shapeshifting
The danger ping sound effect is comedy gold
Nimona?🧐
At least this isn’t ai generated
... oh another jinx... U people almost  convinced me you were committed to a horror character with literally everything up to this, but yeah, hard pass
It’s so sweet how she spared/saved the guy
ngl this is lowkey Shalltear from Overlord in her Vampire form haha
I like their creativity with the cinematic
Isn't her Escape Buddy the janitor?
this style of art reminds me of nimona
pretty cool character, not much behind it, simple. Wonder if they will make her a very deep character, jinx started out like just a crazy pixie girl too.
Self Taunted….. oh the videos That are sure to come of her W!!! I can’t wait to try try out. 😊
It's like a mix of power from chainsaw man and nimona fused into vampires kinda I LOVE ITTT
1:00 I pinged, not my fault ok xD
que sicenmaitca en la pelea mas balurda
Wish she was actually scary.
Looks like the champion design team ran out of ideas and are now just smashing 2 champs together and calling it new.
Voice doesn't fit the character but cool animation.
WOW that was cool
She hongry
That's literally my wife when she's hungry
The JINX vibes are insaneeeeeeeeeee.... could this be her ACTUAL crazy sister jinx reffers to in her voice lines ?!?!
Really like her innocent crazy serial killing vibe
she's jinx but with blood instead of runeterran meth!
Unhinged Female Character Fans feasting rn
🎶 Detonate the new noise!  🎶 Sounds from the underground, loud, proud!  🎶 Doing what I please! When I leave, I'm a rude boy!  🎶 Future on my mind... I'm leaving the past behind...  ✨ CAN'T STOP ME NOW! CAN'T STOP ME NOW! ✨   (T-Rex, from the netflix film "Nimona").
SHE IS SO BAD
isnt that Nimona?
This trailer is very cringe, and I mean; very. The whole champion concept seems dope asf tho
Would,next question
Of course, RIOT continues to produce horror and ugliness, with the chance ot playing it and watching it for hours during growing up. LoL could be nice game, but better create something disgusting and NOT fix anything inside the game, like AP Shyvana or broken "fixed" Syndra's Q+E that deals double dmg for both spells and not just E's dmg. Sad dying company.
i... i.. I... I CAN FIX HER
Vex 2.0 looks fun
I just love how no one is talking about that the noxians got flamed by LeBlanc for feeding the enemy Briat (0:58)
Yooo they added nimona to league
So when she kill Humans they become fruit and meat its like she playning Fruit Ninja just with meat to
It would have been so nice to get another horror Champ like fiddle...now we got the cursed child of Vladimir and jinx...
I guess with Arcane making Jinx more tragic than entertaining, Riot needed a new psycho girl to fill the void.
neeko: firts time? nimon... briar: what?
The ping sound is such a nice touch lmao
So how many dashes will she get? 20? no mana?
she like jinx
Next Champion confirmed: Escape Buddy (Enchanter)
Oh... so... let's count psychopathic girls we have in league, and mention their gimmick: Nilah, because just by the cinematic you can see she's insane, she has a water sword and some sort of... god/demon curse or whatever? Ye, that.  Our favorite, Jinx, the broken child of Zaun, could be great engineer that could possibly create amusement parks and such... But basically, due to root of all problems, crime and all other type of cruelties and such in Zaun, which basically is the division between wealthy and poor... She became a great gunsmith, demolitionist, pyrotechnician, pyro maniac and of course, a psychopath with a minigun, electric pistol, rocket launcher and grenades.  I think that it's fair to call demon of lust, Evelyn, a psychopath too... As basically, she enjoys bdsm a bit too much...  And bow we have some sort of vampire punkish teen, gremlin crazed on food which for her, are none other than humans... Blaire. In custody of Noxus... which, quite frankly... did not go so well. Also, i do suspect blood magic experiment gone wrong, which in that or other way, might be related to none other, than Vladimir.  I think that wraps it up, perhaps im missing someone, but i can't quite remember right now.
Didn't they just recently released the furry darkin ?
Is that you Nimona??      Oh and obligatory FEET comment on the splash art
o jogo virou putaria
I'm already mentally preparing for people to ruin my ranked games. Income the first-time player feeders T_T
Jinx's new friend?
Loli warwick is not what i expected
The ping sounds at 0:58 😆
I love the VFX!! and animation general
loli champ zzzzzzzzzzz
Cant wait to play Shalltear Bloodfallen in League 😊 ❤❤
1:18 New wallpaper, can't wait to open my pc with one hand everyday
She reminds me A LOT of Nemona if they have the same energy it would be pretty fun !  Oh and please keep it down she's a child
Already looking for exe files
This is the most violent non-violent cinematic i've ever seen and i can't express how much i love it.
is it just me or this giving off Nimona trailer energy?
LA CREATURA
So she had an awesome aesthetic in the spoiler and now she is just a ripoff of nimona sad ^^'
shes kinda ugly but not in the cool monster way lol... she kinda like naarf mixed with like vlad or something
how many times have you watched this?  *yes*
i can fix her
It's vampire jinx
This chick is nuts lol.
wow they actually gave her shoes :DD
I want to be her friend, maybe can be more 😍
am i watching nimona rn
Vampire jinx, very inspired riot
I whoud let her eat me , if she lets me eat her
this looks awesome!!!
Smell the feet
great.... another girl champ with mental issues.....nice....
She feels like a supernatural Jinx  But less crazy
0:58 enemies are missing ping ???????
Oh look jinx has a new friend to play with
I can fix her
Seems cool but the personality and voice actor are the same as jinx..
anyone else think her face so weird in this cinematic compared to the splash?
It give me the same feeling as tai lung prison escape from kungfu panda .Even the elevator .
escape buddy was a legend too bad the guards were so mean to him
omg the voice acting on her is just *chef's kiss*
didnt you just release nefiriy, at least i gotta admit, lol comes with new 2 new champs a year, i cant imagine how much they need to work to do that
....Why does she feel like Jinx as a Child Vampire...?
I dig the music and the video itself is great but her sounding exactly like Jinx is just immersion-breaking.
foot pls
This is cringe
It's not the direction I wanted this champ to go in, but the animation is smooth af so props where props is due
Is she daughter of Sylas?
Nimona wtf
Vlad and Jinx had a kid.
Where is Lute?
Very cool animation of Briar - The Feeting Frenzy - I mean Feeding Frenzy.
fish are friends not food
Broo i love everything  about her my new main
so jinx 2.0
Bro theres already r34
Was not generated by ai hahaha
Stupid me. It was me who fed her, I was too curious when her cell showed up on the LOL client. :(
Creator of this champion watches Overlord. Inspired by Shaltear Bloodfallen lmao
she's so cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
feet pls ayak istiyoruz
Where is scarner rework?
Briar and Jinx are going to be great friends.
Is this the most gruesome cinematic we've gotten??  Also, seems to be not at ALLL a vampire which is ok.  Psycho cannibal is honestly perfect.
Gives me huge Nimona vibes and I love it
Horrible character design, try again riot
Remember guys there's an alternative universe out there where this is the original Jinx
This animation- YES YES YES YES YES
She gives me Nimona vibes.
Sternritter "G" Liltotto Lamperd finally in League
Briar, meet Amumu... I hope you two get along great!
Well... That escalated quickly. 😮
I'll be her escape buddy 🥺👉👈
wellcome to silent hill  leage of legend 😂
So we get a champ thats an ever hungry girl with some permanent handcuffs? I dont see any problems here 🙃
Ok... that's just Nimona... well... guess i got a new main.
League has become a horror game... I like it!
Gives Jinx vibes I love it
was this fortiche?
Jinx + Gollum = Briar
… why does she sound like she’s also voiced by Sarah Williams (Jinx)?
Giving me HEAVY Nimona vibes
Is that Vlads daughter or something?
So vampire jinx?
shalltear briarfallen
i like briars design, cant wait to play her in game
edgy champs classic riot
Budget Namona lmaooo
nimona??
would
Jinx + Nimona + Vampire = Briar
Ah yes another gremlin for the collection.
The Bro opened a Minecraft door 😳
thats just cleveland jinx lmao
strong nimona vibes
Made by Brunch studio for those who are interested. (Btw: it looks à little bite like arcane, and it's also a French animation studio)
so they started making criminal characters again. very interesting, especially this character looks very wild and brutal.
Vampire Jinx. Yandere girlfriend edition. 2edgy5me
I can fix her
Is she Alukard?🤔
It was amazing when she said ITS BRIARING TIME and started to briar all enemies around!!!
Puffy Ami Yumi vibes
ah yes probably another hyper mobile assassin. we ain't got enough of them already riot! keep it coming!
Yeah the pedos gonna enjoy this one
melee jinx.
I WAS PRMOISED SOME FEET FIGHT I DON'T SEE IT !!!!!
Absolutely dies of cringe. What is this lmao.
Definitely Arcane style animation Where is my season 2 Riot!!!!  Liked the trailer though
She looks like Nimona.
Cant wait to have an assassin with 2 million dashes and aatrox level of healing
No way! Riot leaked the new champion!
Jinx 2
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME! NOT HIM
relly like her personality so far.
Isn't briar a boy's name?
Yeah~ we have Shalltear but not smart enough😂
My new waifu
Ok... This cinematic is so good, and i loved this jinx 2.0
what with riot and overly ctue looking girls ?
It's... it's just Jinx...
why is this just pink jinx?
I like the idea of her dragging mop boy around wherever she goes as her "escape buddy".
I ship them. I hope that they continue to be escape buddies
would
Anyone else getting Nimona vibes?
Awesome
*quietly summon r34 artists
I hoped she would be scary, not ugly Her splash art is so good, unlike her model in cinematic
....ok I'm interested
Press F for those people,who got jumpscared before this cinematic💀
Honestly, seeing this and her ingame model makes how they drew her splash art so much weirder.
God, i love the noxian armour
the warning ping sounds lmao
Warwick 2.0  she is nice hehehehee I can't wait to play her in game .
The ? sounds tho xD
Im getting jungler vibes...
I love the visuals of this cinematic so much. She gives off jinx vibes which I don't know how I feel about cause she could've been taken a scarier route but oh well.
For the love of Riot please may she not be a Jungler.
The trailer summarized: Schizophrenia and stylized gore.
Tbh this is very good trailer.
Jinx meet Fruit Ninja?
So where's the fish? I can see no fish around
Rule 34 artists *approves*
ill be honest I was hoping something more along the lines of castlevania and less... whatever this is
Nimona?
I'm not going to lie, her voice sounds way too much like Jinx and the animation style is too much like Jinx' energy. Was expecting more of a Shalltear thing. All in all, kind of weak.
I can fix her.
Well someone at Riot enjoyed Nimona...
Чувствуете? чувствуете где здесь попахивает Нимоной)
Funny how so many people were hating on her looks based on the leaked splash art, but now with a cinematic and proper introduction the aesthetic actually looks good and people like it.
Yay another cutesie boring emo psycho crazy girl, basically Jinx if she had a baby with Warwick, very creative.
I bet her and amumu wpuld get along
Someone watched nimona
WOW
Could you stop with this feminisation please ?? C'mon give us something like Morde ! Something brutal asf !
This is what you get when you hire actual artists.
Makes weapons out of blood; my fave ability. That's ability I would want other than shapeshifting. (PS. She's THICC! 🥸🙊)
Another Broken Champ in the making ❤
jiinx got comeptition
This trailer is sick
Rule34 artists are fast I perdict some NSFW  stuff should be ready by now XD
"Feeding Frenzy"  yep, I knew she was a fish  ah I miss those times playing that game
Rule 34 is coming
Is it just me or is it giving Nimona vibes?
I can fix her
Amazing
god I wish I was him.
THIS IS SO COOL WTF
this is the same voice as jinx . sounds a little too similar imo
we need a witcher for this monster
the aesthetic is cool but man..her kit is BORING. they straight up just gave her vex ult with the fear built in.
Is someone feels NIMONA vibe or its just me
ZAAAAAAMN she got bunda
i can fix her
the retreat ping got me laughing lmao.
Why does she remind me of shalltear.
Seems like she is going to get along well with a certain blue haired individual.
Just match the level of animation in the game, and we're home.
Looks like a melee type jinx, still looks cool though
This Champ looks like it will be fun to play
I am now a briar main for no specific reason at all
1:13 Mandatory: It should have been me not him !
Yea, the League champions are just gonna get worse I guess.
The danger pings at 0:59 are killing me
Ohh yesss thank goodness I thought we lost those dawgs 🤧😭
Imagine she looked normally, like a chad mordekaiser for example, instead of being an anime tsundere that emo girls can relate to. This champ is for girls that say they will murder someone when in reality are too scared to ask in mcdonalds for an extra ketchup. Im truly disappointed about the direction, new champions are being created.
No feet at all ????????? Shame 😕
I love her
She remind about shalltear bloodfallen 😂
So Noxian Jinx when it comes to personality?
An Assassin with a ranged attack and probably multiple dashes
OHHH she uses the cage thing to restrain herself!
Someone took heavy inspiration from the Nimona aesthetic
*Jinx 2.0 Cannibal Edition*
If Nimona were a gremlin... I LOVE HER
I love her
Should be some cool cosplay ideas coming with this champ 👀
Her act looks like a girl in Ninoma on Netflix 😂
is this the fruit ninja collab event
Well she has some restraint
I can fix her
I'm here for the feet jokes..
WOAH NELLY
Gosh she's adorable! Riot, as always, made a style. God bless them soulz
it reminded me of Arcane XD
Yay jinx finally has a friend
Be careful with your flesh aroud this one, fellas! Very nice video! I have not seen much of LoL cinematics, maybe I should buck that trend.
And she's just Jinx from Borderlands rather than creepy horror child. Oh well, there is always the next 200 years to look forward too. At least he feet are more covered lmao
Vampire Gnar, nice
0:35 this has so meany Nimona vibes or it's just me?
Danger Jinx... Got it.
Shalltear Bloodfallen is it you?
I kinda see Shalltear
I’m glad she isn’t totally bait and has some horror to her, she strikes a good balance imo
Legs...
I can explain...
why does every female champ have like mental health issues lmao?
why does she remind me a lot of Nimona for some reason?
I think riot games should make an animated tv show about league of legends because thier IP is very cool.
That's MY escape buddyy
N-NIMONA???
cringe dog champion
Ok, now we know that she isnt blind
I can fix her.
Kled got a new enemy, now who can rival in psycho energy.
Just what nobody needed in league: ANOTHER champion. is there ever going to be LoL Classic? this new age dog fairy cat spam nonsense has been unfun to play for years now- I only check up in hopes for classic?
This is where the biggest budget of the year went to
that's a trailer my friends :) now we r talking xD
Please tell me she might appear in arcane
so.....jinx but on cocaine xD
Spoiler: Powder had a twin sister called Briar who went missing and became a Darkin Champ XD
Oh boy another jinx. Cool.
Nimona vibe. awesome :)
Boys in lol: 😇 Girls in lol: 😈
I see Warwick and Jinx have had some fun ;D
Probably not a coincidence that Vladimir came out on Wild Rift just recently. He/She looks like a lost kid of his. The way they made the video family friendly is amusing and also impressive! Standard Riot quality!
nueva asesina señores
Mmmm este video me párese la imaginación de un niño 🤔🤔🤔 ya no me atrae como antes en su época de gloria 😞
Oh my…
Sacrier goddess from Dofus/wakfu
why no feet shown
lowkey jinx💀💀
WILD RIFT WHEN?
Potential: Badass vampire prisoner who turns into a monster   Reality: Jinx wannabe, teenager playing vampire
Nimona in League of Legends?!?!
I CAN FIX HER!
Finally a champ to get behind, compared to recent releases.< Though I do was hoping for one that is "pro Noxus triumvirate" last one of those we had was back in 2012 with Darius and Draven been a decade since getting a new champion that would fight for Swain
Shalltear, is that you ?
I loved the animation so much, but I am also so disappointed that we got another cutesy champion instead of a horror one, just a vampire teen who's hungry
This is Tai Lung escaping from the prison but 15 years later. I love it
(sees feet) *sighs*
reminds me of the nemona art style a bit
arcane vibes every where..she has jinx personality traits as well
Yes Briar, that was very fun.
Guys does anyone else see the similarities between this character and Ninmona netflix movie???
Nimona vibes
Feet
Shalltear in LoL be like
What a great new champion to the rift. Can't wait to test her new kit, really !  This seems so refreshing...🙄 Another OP assassin on the rift, can't wait !
Is it just me or this look exactly like a Nimona trailer?
Feet
Jinx 2.0
Jinx+SUIIIlas
ouuuu that was not a hat in the splash art then..
No way Noxian Jinx
Nimona on league of legends
oh no, cringe
THEY JUST USED THE QUESTION MARK PING SOUND 💀
This what happens when u turn jinx into vampire.. she'll go bat crazy frenzy
She reminds me of Nimona - from the movie with the same name
I'm Getting Nimona vibes~
Yo isnt this just like the Tai lung Escape?
Great Cinematic :D
She has a vibe of that 1 friend who dont stop talking
Shes cool but sounds to much like jinx , could  have used a different voice  actor at least in my own opinion,  still  cool nonetheless
New Jinx
ths is my new wife
so jinx 3.0, gotcha
Looks good, i do miss the creep-factor on her though. Too wholesome.
Give me the 2 season of arcane already
So it is the feet champ trailer
Vampire Jinx has instantly become a favorite of mine!
Animation amazing but she us just giving another jinx energy they can make her personality more diffrent kind of crazy
Nimona? Is that you?
this reminds me of nimona for some reason
It's like melee jinx wtf
OOOOOOUUUHHHHHH 😭😭😭
Beautiful friendship
r34 no exceptions
VAMPIRE NIMONA LETS GOOOO
She gives of Nimona energy
Is it just me or shes giving nimona vibes
I would love for her to meet jinx.
hm yes, the iconic color of blood, pink
I CAN FIX HER
An escape prisoner?  Looks like sylas isnt alone
So glad to see they added Power from Chainsaw Man to League of Legends
Nimona?
Vlad: can we makes babies Lee sin: sure
Ains sama, I already found Miss Shalltear!
I can fix her
She sounds an awful lot like Jinx.
Can't wait for Briar to jump over 6 walls and oneshot me! Such a vibe man!
Nimona energy check ❤
Qyana and Annie had a child somhow
I expected horror vampire, We got demented Nimona. Im sold
Gremlins in League????? What????
she`s adorable ... and absolute phycopath ... but adorable
wooow amazin and coolest one i like this one ❤
Fruit Ninja has returned!!!! 🍓🍎🍍🍌🥥
mmmm quirky toessss
Goblin
feet 🤤
Vampire jinx
I can't wait for the feet...
Where is the BLOOD?!? ( Pink collored watermellon juice?)
Well, close enough to monsters at least
Сюда
soo... melee jinx?
Nimona??
💀
goooooooood
design looks like she belongs to a different game like  skullgirls or s000mthing  good music and animation was very JINX like
I guess since they're trying to make Jinx emo and gritty now, they had to roll out a replacement wacky/psychotic character.
Seems we’ve found Jinx’s Noxian counterpart.
WHERE ARE THE FEET
would
She’s perfect for Arcane season 2. Also she’s giving me nimona vibes 👹
I see this champ can one-shot everyone
im getting the Gorillaz vibes from the artwork
Idk, I just remember Shaltear from Overlord when I saw this.
Nimona aesthetic
Jinx vibes
Isn’t this just jinx 2.0 ??
She's basically Ironmouse the champion!
So...a Noxus Jinx,right?
She looks like the type of person to randomly go GOBLIN MODE.
Otro berserker descerebrado? Ya estaban Mundo y Sión para eso...
fajna dupeczka, polecam gorąco, włożyłbym mimo że zimna pewnie jest xoxo
Would
ARCANE SEASON 2 WHEN
Those guards sure be pingin
Oh god, its Nimona if she was allowed to eat people
It’s giving Nimona
The short conversation with her inside the cell was really creepy, 10/10
And other anime girl...
cant wait for another champ with dashes and blinks   Oh wait i quited a while ago  anyways looks cool
Reminds me of FLCL
Shalltear Bloodfallen
Nice "vampire" champion. Again Rito with a new and interesting twist to subvert our expectations.  in the wise words of a wise kid: "I expected nothing and i'm still disappointed"
Another Jinx... meh
Having her weapon basically be both a restraining pillory and blades is actually a really neat design. It really sells the "become the monster they see you as" aesthetic they went for.
LETS GOOOOOOO
Ok but can she become Jinx's best friend?
0:59 that danger ping XD
Someone's been watching Nimona...
Mom can we have Shalltear? We already have gotic loli from overlord anime series at home Gotic loli from overlord at home:
OK call me crazy but I think that whistling at the end is the same as the one Fiddlesticks does in his voice lines. And I've listened to both like 20 times now and they are almost exactly the same length and sound kinda similar. The only problem is that Fiddles is a little hard to properly understand.
Briar casually just playing fruit ninja with the guards
I can fix her...
Need monster again 😅champions
eh its jinx with gremlin look  8[ would have loved more boddy horror theme or a some husk lookin creature  but eh gotta do dat design for the hornibaitz yo  idk man for me she dosent look very league of legendzy   idk man maybe im just sour boy for wanting my fav character themes
She's fun and easily my new favourite character just imagine a conversation with her and jinx how will it go
Not trying to be toxic but regardless the work and effort behind this I still have my opinion about her, basically  we just got another anime rule34 material, so far the in-game model and animations are terrible, honestly the goofiest I've seen so far since I started playing League, those are legit at the level of old Udyr. The idea is there but the execution is just awful, another pretty face, even if they would make a human character who is for example 52 years old that mf would have the face of a k-pop idol.
CUNNY!!! 😭😭😭😭
I'm getting Nimona vibes
Crazy aesthetict, and also love the ping-alert noises, some soldiers there are for sure flamers. x'D
Uglyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Jinx 2.0. Wow. Yeah, I'll pass, sounds and behaves like jinx and warwick had an illegitimate child.
Thanks. I hate it.
It’d be amazing if she only communicated through maniacal rawrs while on her unleashed form, but you can still hear her normal voice translating
Danger ping pdst
Getting Nimona vibes lmao
would
wonder if she'll be best buddies with jinx
a jinx character with a warwick playstyle it seems. interesting
"Monster champion".. we got a dog and a rocker girl on drugs..
Pink jynx? nice.
Holy BASED
So a copy of Shalltear Bloodfallen lmao
is that you Shalltear?
So like a jinx and Warwick mix… lame.
BOOOOOORIIINNGGGG
Design looks great, as always. Just please don't give her 5 jumps and an execute...
Lame champ, malphite better
This is Shalltear Bloodfallen 😍😍😍😍
Big Nimona vibe !
fix your game
cinda bland for league
Love the contrast of her appearance vs. voice/personality.   She literally looks like the stuff of horrors then just "Hi~ 😃" Also, her eyes really remind me of Shalltear's true form. That said, they're both vampires 😂
Nimona vibes... Like It💖💖
She's in Arcane Season 2
oh yeah new loli
Wtf Nimona
Feet
jinx resurrected
Looks like borderlands 😂 i like it
So werewolf Jinx? Wekcome, join the waifu line..i know, i know , its massive. The horror line? Aha, not with those curves. You're a monster? Sorry hun, our large furry demographic disagrees. And don't get me started on our bdsm fans with these shakles you got going on. You're textbook waifu, but Nimona is adored everywhere so you can ride that wave! Welcome to Rule-- i mean Riot!
people who like bricks get even worse
Nimona?
its nice, but where are feet?
oh boy... another female champ. who's seemingly mentally unstable.  yay.  I guess this would have been treading on Vlad's coattails; but, wouldn't a youthful guy/boy with the same vibe be more interesting or unique? I dunno, if I'm wrong do go ahead and point it out.
So basically the design team watched Nimona and said “yea we can work with this”
wish she did that to me
Gremlin yandere GF?????? Now thats something else.
Okay jinx 2.0 wow :/
Nimona is that you?
Nimona
Glad the janitor lives
I can fix her
Is it just me or she look inspired from Shalltear Bloodfallen ?
Another crazy girl
personality is just jinx lol, voice even sounds like her too.
Someone at Riot really liked Nimona huh? XD I LOVE THIS!! Voice is a little too close to jinx, but hey, I'm looking forward to release regardless! Also, as soon as I saw that neck device I was thinking about how it would be weaponized and splitting in half at the crystal was just what I was thinking about! So cool.
Very jinx like, almost gives me a reskin vibe
evelyn 2.0
Nerfed before released, she has shoes now.
She sounds more like jinx voice not gonna lie.
Nimona but will actually kill you if you cross her
Awesome cinematic, very cool artistic directions
Isn't she Nimona but Vampire in this cinematic?
Good to know there is still a team within RIOT to still do animations/cinematic considering the fact that of the obvious....
The style in which the graphical violence was handled was excellent, I wanna see a whole movie like this
anyone know if this is going to be a new champion or somthing?
Meh it's ok, the animation is a 10/10 as always but the character is just missing something.
❤
Sooo Vampire Jinx? Ight i rock with that.
Um is that....Powder?
Its definitely jinx 😆🤣
Daymn, she really is noxian.  Also, nice idea of including a warning sound from the  game
MY VLAD FINDS HIS MATCH! ALRIGHT SHE'S GOING TO BE MY SECOND MAIN!
<3
She remind me of Jinx😊
sooooo Shalltear Bloodfallen + Nimona ? got it
Shalltear  Bloodfallen?
so another edgy girl ? original
Discount Tiny Tina ?
Briarussy
Nerf please
I can't wait to see the community complain about this character not being some weird monster ugly as fack that no one would play because it's disgusting to even look at it and instead it's a normal looking vampire!
It can't beat Jax can it?
They did a champion reveal trailer better than the season start video. Go figure Riot...
So did Riot ever try to make her scary at all? Cause the splash art shows her with a cute face and now in the cinematic she's just straight up goofy. Like Jinx Lil sister.
i hope we can get this champ on Halloween how fitting
Saquen el rework de skarner
Nimona, anyone?
We don't need a new Jinx....
ok ok question does this champ remind anyone of shalltier from overlord
Nimona rated R I love it
The most frightening part is that it makes sense that there is no blood shown. She’s consuming it all….       🩸🧃🤤
If Jinx was so cool how come there's no Jinx 2?
noooo not a bunch of hot emo goth girls on the timeline doing briar cosplays ohhhh nooooo!
I hate riot, but their cinematics are the best button
Ok hear me out...
Vlad and Jinx got busy it seems
Pretty cool cinematic, I like the changing of the animation
Jinx personality version 2 is crazy
"She's been fed!" Imagine if Briar is late-game type champ this would be one of those "famous last words" moments
No gore 🙄
league of assassins?
Soo basically just feral Jinx
so jinx and evelynn had a baby...
I almost hear jinx... Same VA?
Reminds me of tiny tina from Borderlands lol
Basically  Warwick+Jinx+some vampire stuff
Indeed that was fun.
I was totally right, she does have a Shaltear berserk mode. Love the champ good design at least visually, hope it looks just as good in game.
It’s always some cutesy anime stuff lately. Lol.
Muy nimona vampiro, pero no me quejo lol siempre fue "copiare tus personajes y le pondre my copyright ". Jejejeje
jinx vibe ?
*I CAN FIX HER*
The poor janitor bro . . .
Little sad they reused jinx's pink punk asthetic...
Man like why waste the animation? We got nothing about the "creepy mass destruction monster", I would fear Nunu more than this
a cyborg shalltear bloodfallen
cringe
I can fix her.
Jinx's inner demon finally escaped
i can fix her
yall known shitpost this is riot doing that with champs
Justice league is awesome
Ok but like shes the perfect combo of adorable and creepy It works really well
Hi nimona
Shaltear Bloodfallen + Jinx, you can't deny the resemblance in design
Will every League Cinematic have this type of animatic? It's cool, but it really doesnt fit the league vibe...
This gives me Nimona vibes for some reason
Loved Nimona, it was such a good movie
more weeb trash zzz
Yeah Riot, you are absolutely right. Arcane DID mellow Jinx too much, It's time to massively overcorrect on the manic crazy.
She can fix me
Cringe
0:59  Is it just me or am I hearing some SFX that most people hear about?       (For those wondering where are my comment, yes YouTube got shadowbanned for no reason)
She actually sounds like Spinel from Steven Universe movie. Not to mention act like her.
I wish I was him 😂😂😂😂
This is so similar to nimona i love it!!!
A Certain vampire from overlord
Hear me out
Across the Runeterraverse
So…melee blood mage jinx?
CARAKHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Art style reminds me of Nimona
Reminds me of jinx
Yo no quiero champs quiero la segunda temporada de arcane y la quiero ya!!! O exploto su edificio en los angeles  malditos!!!
League cinematic getting more out of hand
This kind of reminds me of that one escape scene from Nimona, and the style as well
god new champion designs are so boring....
Tailong(?
Such a cool animation!!
she's gonna be my new main
Tailong(?
Hmm I expected something different, but let's see how she turns out.
trash
Obviously the team doesn't listen to pings.
Tailong(?
She Is giving me nimona vibes🙇
WHAT
Well, someone at Riot enjoyed the Nimona movie, huh?  Cool trailer, nice champion :)
So, Nimona as a champion?
jinx on drugs (even more drugs)
Please give me a general from the iolia region
hello...now im otp Briar 😎👍
she’s clearly an cannibal not an vampire lol
HOLD ON a minute, get our top men to analyze those gripper shots. I want a report by tomorrow.
Am I getting too old for LoL?
Nimona vibe
that was impressive
I bet there's already hentai of her
finally we see jinx sister?
Anyone else getting Nimona vibes?
Is she a demon?
she just like me fr
Hello loli Vladimir with Jinx personality. Aren't you... original.
1:12 "ma'am this is the scariest and hottest moment of my life."
This would be cooler with ai tbh
Briar's and Naafiri's cinematics are so cool.
lucky guy at the end, bro had briar on top of him 👀
i thought she was gonna have abit maturer voice or so, but hey this jinx voice works too
Gurl be playing fruit ninja
Me recuerda a Stitch. «Eres vil, eres feo. ¡Defecto! . Y... ¡tierno y esponjoso!»
Nice they put Ironmouse in the game.
She sounds like Jinx, I love gremlin girls. Perfection.
adorable
Would have bet money this was same VA as Jinx from Arcane Ella Purnell, but turns out it is Julie Nathansson 🤯
Its like the same abilities than chogath
Where her feet at???
The art these last two cinematics have been amazing, please dont let off the gas!!
First time in a long time a cinematic gives me the chills!
Can't wait for TBSkyen to break down this 1:32min cinematic into a 65min animation analysis video.
Who is that? Jinx inner demon mixed with eve?
BDSM fantasy intensified 😮
Feels inspired by Arcane.
0:58 question mark ping sounds?
Feeting Frenzy
Ay its Nimona
Im 100% convince that people on the design team. took inspiration from the movie Nimona!!! I love this so much!!
I feel like this is jinx if she actually went to prison. It could be the same voice actor if they wanted
Rule 34
This is drug addict jinx, that has vex abilities
This cinematic was legit fun
so shes just Jinx but a vampire
I like her! i think i will pop back in on league and try her out for a few games
If I had a nickel for every Noxian girl in League whose powers are the results of experiments from the Black Rose, I would have three nickels (Rell and technically Annie).  Come on Riot, you can be more original!
Bro fainted when she got on top 😂
Jinx's vocal from Arcane?
the ping sound effect
Hopefully her kit is as cool as her design. And hopefully she isnt a female warwick
well thats boring
BallinCat43
Nimona 👀
I'm just going to say... NIMONA
Omg i love her personality
i swear they've made her less cute so we don't sexualize her but you can't stop me i do what must be done
I find it hilarious that the twitter freaks made a big deal out of her Splash art and now we got her Cinematic that shows how vampiric she is more than Vladimir.  Wonder how those twittards are reacting now.
Someone absolutely watched Nimona. I thought this was going to be an horror movie. This was so punk!
She gives me nimona vibes and she has such a good look and aesthetic ngl
Ok, let me just get it out for some of you guys POV and by you guys, I'm included.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME, NOT HIM.
I would definitely prefer to be her friend than not. Once again they smash the character cinematics!
0:32 the jet like wings on her back gives me Valstrax vibe and i love it
I hate her so much worst champ this year
Looked like a teaser video for the next season of Arcane. I wouldn't really mind though XD
Give us the feet back
The internet is fast 😂
Noxian Jinx
Nimone can turn into anything,  So she turned into a vampire.
Nimona is that you?
this gives jinx vibes but in red
This is where League's whole budget went.
How old is she
So they made a melee Jinx huh?
Ok so... Jinx part 2?
😭😭😭
Not a fan of nemone artstyle
i can fix her
Nimona ???????
Nimona vibes im here for it !! ❤
sooo excited
Watched this trailer like 20 times and I got to give it to rito. They made one of the best trailer from animation to music. This champion deserve a clap with no hands for this one. 🙂
I guess we should invest in Snickers and keep her well feed.
Vampire jinx
i've seen this scene, it was Tai Lung escaping!
yall think i didnt peep the fact that u used the danger ping but i did nice touch
Feet
*Would*
She needs to find amumu
Me when i'm blind.
So Jinx and Nimona as a vampire? I like it, but seems like another Zeri and Neon situation. Check the creative teams palms, someone's been copying homework.
Cringe.
Quest : Is she gonna kill that person or not, just curious 🤔
Her design is interesting but her personality is just so boring... Jinx 2.0
She reminds me of shalltear bloodfallen from overlord anime lol
This is so Nimona vibe, i like that
Finally nice, not copied character design, hope mechanically, too. If yes ... then Riot is going awake from their ashes!
Nimona?
great, another mobile champ with built in sustain and cc with no cooldown.
I want to be her escape buddy
I cringe every single time Riot censores blood.
its remind me nimona
League of anime girls
Another Noxian champion that doesnt fight for Noxus XD
I get a jinx vibe from her. That just me?
ало нимона выйди и зайди нормально
sound like rainbow dash ! qwq
Briar come home to Wild Rift.
Rito please make her and that guy friends
-1/10
I like how they tried to imply the gore without actually showing any of it. Nicely animated
no longer breedable
This has the same vibes as spiderverse. I like it
" She can fix me "
💀the feet got nerfed lmao
She is so cute and funny 😭😭😭😭
La grande question maintenant c'est : Est-ce vraiment Netflix qui nous respectent ou bien juste Oda qui a vraiment supervisé tout ça ?
Punk af
Sounds way too much like jinx here lol wtf
So... basically a vampire Gura?
Personality consept reminded me Jinx a bit
Nice to see a loli in this game can't wait to see how the weirdos online go crazy for her and put these 😂 emojis out
The arcane vibes tho!  Riot is this your way of telling that arcane season 2 production is in works (which we know) but want to keep us hyped about animation huh?
Kinda reminded me of Shalltear Bloodfallen from Overlord
Feet.
Wonder how long it will take for her to get a wiki feet page
0:41 My man really said "Would"
Hi Female Warwick
I thot that she was a loli
Cleaning guy champ when?
I feel like they really took inspiration from Nimona. Same type of voice, a "frenzy" transformation, very colorful and hyped animation.
Oh she's not evil crazy she's pyro from tf2 crazy
smash next question ?
The two "danger" pings at 0:58, Am I alone to noticed them? 😂😂
on the weak side this one, had potential to be a brilliant horror short
Shalltear Bloodfallen It's not even her.
Anyone else getting Nimona vibes?
Fantastic! Just bummed out that they cannot make a serious champion out of her. None of the marvel comedy voicelines ect.
Just Great....Another Psycho. Girl...
They watched to much into the spider verse.   But I do love like she's like " escape buddy! He's a friend ! And you are food !" Lol
They made sure to make the mouth lick at the start 60frames 👍
Hands down, amazing cinematic as always
Her and jinx would be besties for sure
Nimona ripoff?
Jinx with powers
until its red
Copy paste jinxes character boooring
Ah yes, the bootleg foot fetish nimona
Vladimir's trailer looked better.
A watered down Shaltear Bloodfallen, nice cinematic and overall decent vibe. The way it played out you could almost assume the transformation is similar to Gnar's with the scream being her ult instead of wallop
Well Damacia, what this says about your methods of handling mages?
When can I play herrrr??
What a disappoiting design
I get it someone likes lolis but GUYS REMEMBER, DONT STICK IN CRAZY
Alright who put jinx software on the vampire hardware
The title reminds me of a certain fish game
vibe: Vampire Jinx
someone liked nimona
And always the chars from the game themself are not there and too if this is a trailer if thats canon thats stupid but gg go forward kill more noxians
The music and the demon form reminded me of Mirajane's demon from Fairy Tail 🤔
She looks super dope! wonder what her login screen music will be! maybe we'll see her meet vladimir and other buddies in the future!
Are we not gonna talk about riot not teasing us with her feet?
I dunno, I expected her to be more *feral* and not jinx 2. I can't wait to see her concept arts and try her out on pbe.
Alright that was cool.
Cute
My last name is Briar and I love her already 😩❤
Smash, i mean cant wait to see her abilities 😅
It is very similar to nimona i like it :)
How to make family friendly a gory scene:
Jinx voice actor?
What a wholesome man eating gremlingirl. Even spared her escape buddy
FALL BACK PINGS!!! 00:59
The way she reminds me of Nimona and even the whole aesthetic of this trailer
Nimona what happend to you?
As a jinx player. If she not from an asylum, I don't want her.
kinda gives me eve vibes
jinx vibe
yep, def Shaltear
She ain’t bad I guess she is a little jinx but knows what she doing
That was a super cool trailer. Escape buddy, lol.  But i wish she wasn't wearing shorts on design. The design SCREAMS for anything but shorts.
Someone watched Nimona
I support women's wrongs.
To whoever made the theory that she lulls people around with her child like personality, i appreciate the attempt but now we know briar indeed just wants friends!  ...but she seems to go really feral and maybe can't get many.
Big nimona vibes on this one
Like like rito staff watched nimona
I absolutely love the art style of this cinematic, its fresh and energetic!
jinx 2?
Someone just saw Netflix Nemona
i can fix her
Great aesthetics and animation overall, really interesting champ...  (I thought tencent were trying to remove the "bloodiness" of the game and now we have another vampire lol)
ok.. basically it's Nimona
Someone on the Riot team loved Nimona a bit too much.
cool cinematic, still a feet coomer champ
Great Soundtrack
League rule 84: If it’s a female champ there’s already a nsfw subreddit
tell me the artist watched Nimona without telling me the artist watched Nimona
akli.... nvm
Her voice sounds similar to Ella Purnell's, wonder if it's her VA
I dunno... she sounds like Jinx from Arcane. So I just feel it's vampire Jinx. Also kinda bummed her shackles break open, it's kind of like, what is even the point of them??
Hmmm... Did they get Sarah Anne Williams for her?
I loved Nimona!
She's got BIG Niomona vibes  I love it
Gives me Nimona vibes 🥹
that animation is disgusting
They saw andareal from diabo and said we want
Good for her to soon finally taste otber flavors~
Cool, Nimona's in League of Legends!
Pitch meeting : People loved arcane so ... lets make another Jinx but with more JINX !
So freaking cute 🥰
So she's basicall another jinx
This is juat Nimona tho
1:12 it should've been me, not him!
She is what would come out if Vladimir and jinx had a child
“I think Jinx just got  competition with Briar” Awesomeness a Ghoul Character!!
Nimona if she lost her morals and I’m so here for it
Havent been so hyped about a champion since Pyke!
Honestly, it gives pretty big Nimona vibes. Not like, the characters or art are that similar, I don't know how to describe it, lmao. Glad they do lean into a little bit more monstrousness here at least, even if they don't in-game.
Not bad riot (slow clap)….not bad at all😎
Bruh, someone watched Nimona a lot
her and nimona would be friends. METALLL
Would
I think her and Jinx would be good friends
FEEEEEET
I'm honestly disappointed, I expected more psychotic personality in comparison to Jinx.
So, she's jinx if she was a loli vampire...
Is that Shalltear from overlord?
Soo...Warwick but loli?
I would, next question.
I love the Danger ping sound effect.
It's literally Jinx 2.0, same VA even?
Feet timestamp: 0:32 0:35 0:38 0:42 0:47 0:48 0:51 0:55 1:06 1:08 1:13
not a fan was hopeing for a more grim vampire than a teenage girl tbh could been women but they went for this teenage girl approach weird feels tacky its just trying to hit that anime market i guess
what if she meets jinx,
great
Nice moral of the story is b***es be trippen when they hungry
new main
So now riot is scared of showing blood? The splash art convey a very different vibes.
She kinda reminds me of nimona
Is that the same voice actress from Arcane Jinx or am i tripping?
so a movement ability a melee ability a shout ((aoe) likely steroid)) a reset ability that ties with her passive (healing)  i'm betting on a jungle assassin  the one thing i don't vibe with is that it feels like warwicks video but without the terror due to her personality she might be fun though we will see how she plays
i d love to have a wife like that
thsi feels like jinx v2 with warwick behaviour
I don't know why but this cinematic feels so rushed overall.
OH boi, Jinx will like her a lot XD
She has a baby face but a woman's legs, that is so weird.
arcane? 🤨
Vou me divertir pra caralho jogando de gollum
I WANT TO BE HER ESCAPE BUDDY ME ME ME ME ME ME 🤚🏾🤚🏾🤚🏾🤚🏾🤚🏾🤚🏾🤚🏾🤚🏾🤚🏾 PLEEASE PLEASE WOOF WOOF BARK BARK MUNCH MUNCH GOBBLE GOBBLE, THE MONSTER IN ME IS GETTING BIGGER, I CANT HOLD BACK THE DOG ARF ARF ARFFF
Nimona?¿?¿?
Tai Long aah escape
Welp, she gave me Nimona's vibes
I retract all my previous critisism based on the leaked art, she's cool af
1. jinx can have a friend on her wavelength  2. vayne is having a cold shiver in her spine somewhere 3 kinda hot
Nimona in all the Word
amazing champion,  am I the only one who thinks he looks more like a ghoul or wendigo than a vampire?
Hardcore Nimona energy right there
She wants me fr
Sounds like Jinx's voice actor
FEET
I would love to see the interaction between Swain and LeBlans when he finds out... :D
overlord shalltear
She is playing Fruit Ninja with the guards :D
jinx rip of with warwick kit cool comunity lieks it tho XD
I need a friend like her.
It's giving Nimona
Haha. I can smell the R34 and at that, I'm worried. Cool Champion. Wish the voice would be more scarier but I ain't complaining.
You've got the METAL HELLSINGER composer for this champ, i'm hyped
I feel like it have the same touch as ARCANE and it made me feel nostalgic
very nice
why she wearing shoes?
I like her  but her personality it's too much Jynx
feed on me
must protecc at all cost
this animation reminded me that Lol has blood and death
I did think the next champion cinematic after Naafiris will feel much weaker in comparison but man this is also reeaally good
Some veeeeeeeery strong Nimona vibes in here....
Shalltear Bloodfallen?
Oh noo, it's our fault, we feed her through the client
Giving jinx a run for her money
I CAN FIX HER
Why this cinematic, the teaser in-client and her splash art have different vibes..? They're, like, 3 different champs
no because her and escape buddy better be best friends
how come the champion looks worse and worse everytime? 😑
so it's power
0:59 Danger Ping
Can't wait to see how tasty everyone will be to her.
She gave me full nimona vibes
Shalltear Bloodfallen
more adult themed Nimona
One more highly mobile assassin to run around one shotting everyone. How cool...
Nimona! You're not you when your hungry. Have some fresh blood.
A cannibal Nimona. Love it!
Nimona?
Hear me out I CAN FIX HER
It's vampire Jinx.
so she's basically jinxdimir
Did you just make Jinx again
friend will never recover from that
I can fix her
New Anime Riot Girl:  Lolli Edition, incredibly lame
This champ reminds me of Shalltear
I love her and can't wait to play her!!! <3 But her voice gives me jinx vibes
cant believe they made nimona a league champion
I can't believe their "scary" champion is a barefoot vampire loli lmaoooo
What a creepy cutie. <3
Stranger: be you friend or food? The mark is Her measure: show us the brand of the Absolute.
Bruh isnt this nimona 😂
Nimona in league of legends
... this is just Shalltear
Casually just gets a high score in irl fruit ninja
she does look crazy when she go ...crazy. that is good. the voice not creepy as I hope when she be in the crazy form.
Yeah, definitely NOT the personality i was expecting, she's basically what if Jinx was noxian, a vampire and didn't use guns. I expected her to be more creepy rather than just chaotic 😂
Am I the only one that got HUGE Nimona vibes from the cinematic and the champ?
Ah, so it's just Nimona without the shape-shifting. How original.
Wait nimona sister?
There was a ton of simulators I think taken from Spider Verse both cinematically and musically. Very interesting. Looks cool all the same!
Okay i dont love her voice but i really like her design and this animation
its giving, vampire Jinx
Well, that's what I call a SICK cinematic. Well done!
Frenzy looks like R. Scream/Shockwave maybe W. Q is maybe just enchanced AA and E looks like normal dash :)
Oh boy I’m sure the community will do nothing weird with her
I CAN T SEE FEET  NOOOO RIOT
... Nimona, right? Cool
ale sraka
You know what? I’m in
so Evelynn and Vladimir got freaky and made this ?
Cute
Omg they added Nimona to League???
Vs cell buddy
Foot fetish incarnate
If Jinx were a vampire 😂
Feet.
I can fix her
Double frenzy, triple frenzy,super frenzy, mega frenzy        who know he get it
once again a pretty face... and annoying aswell
All i saw is toph
Riot, nerf her at least 3 times before you realse her.
Is this Fortiche animation? Arcane vibes
E - E Bel'Veth + R Qiyana  R = R+W Vex Passive - Passive Darius.  Wtf rito
Cant believe they added nimona in the game
Expected more feral I think, idk, something feels off, its like vampire jinx and they said ye its done
Why am I getting Jinx energy?
A fighter assassin
i feel like her and jinx could be besties XD
Ahhh yeess with this new champion, I bet Felix of Stray Kids will enjoy this too, as a fan one can hope that they get to be on Riot's Music team as well!! 🥹🍀
Never forget what they took from us
I thought the champion looked cool until I saw this.
So something similar to Shalltear's blood frenzy. A caster that switches to melee, I wonder if it's going to be uncontrollable like gnat. Should have gone with a different personality though. A personality gap would have been better.
this is just vampire jinx
Thought this was a red Gura thing for a second
Parente de jinxed?
Finally, a new nuts that can rival Jinx
She's so hot
Is this what happens when you feed Jinx after midnight?
Nimona Vibes
She looks related to sylas all chained up
shut up and take my moneyy
That guy is so lucky bro had briar standing on top of him
Shalltear?
overlord Shalltear??
Ahora si podre decir soy main briar desde la beta
Jinx 2.0 🎉
love  the chmp, but not a fan of the voice
Definitely gonna sp this,,,, just to annoy my adc hahhaa
very well made. awesome
jinx from arcane and briar sound exactly alike, but theyre not the same voice actress? im finding this hard to believe
Nimona vibes
The animation team goes absolutely crazy once again
So she’s Jinx, but crazier
Is it just me or this animation look kinda similar to Nimona. 😮
...I can fix her.
I was umhh... expecting a complete animal.
Jinx rework?
is it morbin time?
Shalltear Bloodfallen 😮😮
Oh a melee Jinx
Wow anime vampire with Jinx personality what a orginal idea
i cant wait for the wonderful and tasteful art the community will surely make
Can't wait
So someone high up on the design team saw nimona and wanted to just make that Daring today arent we?
0:59 Is it just me or am I hearing a ping?
she is giving me some nimona vibes and i dont know why
ADC: No more💀 😂
Nimona?
Nimona shapeshifts onto the scene!
giving Nimona vibes i love it
She could be the boss of vampire's dungeon in Waven
?
I feel like the champ has nothing new to offer, wierd mix of warwick, evelyn and jinx
Imagine her and Jinx meet up 💀
It's really lame that they built her up as a horror champ only for this to be the turnout.
Oh a young girl with thick thighs; definitely something that was missing!!!!
Another socially akward super special secret lethal weapon from noxus who escaped. Cool i guess.
Okay I was worried at first but she's genuinely terrifying
Jinx 2.0
Someone fed Jinx after midnight and now its everyones problem.
Rule 34 artists unite!
Darius: noxus can i have Warwick ? Noxus: we got Warwick at home  Warwick at home:
She's so cute and funny
when it is available In India For Android Users 😢😢
Briar : "Look at me, I'm the crazy now"  Jinx : TRIGGERED
The censorship, I can't 💀💀
fix the game
I thou they gonna make it more scary
lo-ve-ly
I dont like her voice
:(
jinx 2.0
Shalltear flash back :'3
Somebody watched Nimona
i wanna hear the japanes voice line for her soooooo badly
She has an install super!
Better fix mmr system
Sounds like Jinx in Arcane
Riot really saw the success of jinx and made every champion after a multiversal version of her
She kinda gives me a feeling like I just saw Shalltear from Overlord. I love her already!
Jinx but a Vampire
pues se ve muy bacansita la animación
cringe
Jinx rip-off??
that should be me
NIMONA ?
"Hot take....I think she's 300 years old above..." - Jax main
BloodSeeker
well someone watched overlord
0:59 tf were they pinging
I can't believe Riot made Mylo come back from the dead and infect jinx with his likeness. Like some sort of...Radioactive Mylo.... MyloJinx
Buenisima la animación
Anyone else ready for a new main?
hear me out..
Fruit ninja looking ah champ 💀
ah they finally made a champ for 2010 tumblr
Shalltear?
I can fix her
Melee Jinx seems cool
great, Nimona's here
i think i fell in love
Now someone has to make a comic of Jinx, Zoe and Briar having a world tour together.
Nimona Energy, i dig it!
oh yay. cant wait for warwick 2. woo.
Characters with similar vibes can be neat, but the exact same style of presentation for two characters in the same setting gets awkward fast.
They finally did it JINX 2
thanks for leaving the toes. And you guys made me realize i have foot fetish so thx?
nimona came back
This is a love letter to Nimona, they would be besties
Bad consept
F E E T
NIMONA/20
So far we had splash and teaser what have horror atmosfer such Fidelsticks or better. Now we here... idk it's a joke? Jinx + Nimona????
nimona?
That cinematic was awesome but im shocked this is coming out so quick after Nafiri was juat released
me initially: omg she has bare feet!  me now: what is wrong with thins unhinged goblin lady
In before every girl I know:  She's just like me fr!
Wow… literally Vampire Jinx personality.
Its like a member of Gorillaz came to league
Nimona is that you?
league cinematics are good again!
Gives off the vibe "Jinx ... but what if she was a vampire?"  AND I LOVE IT!
Nimona be like
I can fix her
This reminds me of Nimona
getting some Kung Du Panda - Tai Lung escape vibes :D
wow Annie and Lulu have now been replaced as being my favourite character
They made a vampire flavor Jinx
I wish she was more creepy. Oh well
Riot: How do we show blood and gore without getting demonetized? Animation Team:
A another crazy chick in a row.
Our 3D animators are already researching.  2D illustrators are already posting their fabulous works.
Yvonne's new main
I can fix her.
Has Jinx energy in a vampire goblin, very cool though I was expecting less sanity xD
She sounds a whole lot morre sane than i thought she would
Nimona?
I dislike her so much, The arm pillory is such a terrible design choice, the disgusting blind eyes and punctured teeth, with the kiddie voice, i hate it
crazier would have been good, she just seems joyful in the slaughter. a beast which is denied sustenance for an elongated period of time would go mad. aside of that the i liked it.
feet.
i can fix her
i have a feeling jinx and her would get along XD
Nimona? Is that you?
would
reminds of me of that Elfen Lied sequence...
So bad ngl
Noxian jinx
finally we get a vampire-sylas-jinx!
Initiate rule 34
She beautiful and cute
Another dashing assasin
Footjob GODDESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* achievement unlocked* New kink of waifu
So she has a huge aoe and more dash than Akali. Seem's plenty balanced to me
Nimona.
It's like hearing jinx from arcane speaking.
I love her that my psycho friend
People, what is the name of THE RULE ?
Now the real question for you guys   Would you let her top you? 🤔
Very similar to jinx
Riot IS fan of nimona
I gotta say, Cringe, dude it's Cringe.
I can fix her
Nimona, but on steroids and blood lust
who keeps locking ppl with supernatural power behind a *WOODEN DOOR*
i need rule34
She looks amazing BUT RIOT PLS!!! Let her break pillory after 6 and walk like that.
It feels like news champions are being released very week with how often they come out
well.. "artists" are on their way now....
Scary jinx
Is that Jinx's voice ???
I love her already
She's playing Fruit Ninja
Necrit called it with how her ability would work
Welp, Here we go again. *Unzips pants*
IT HAD TO BE ME NOT HIM, IT'S NOT FAIR
Got that Nimona felling
Nice FruitNinja
that's completely her ult
smash next question
Riot needs to drop the "games" and just become an animation studio
3/10 not enough feet
Hear me out
😮
they really used the missing ping on the guards XD
I feel like the mood changed? At first it felted like we were going to see a more creepy gruesome type of champion with the asylum eerie feeling. This video gives, albeit a scary mood, more of a funny and playful approach.  Still I am exited to play the new champ soon.
Thank god this wan not AI generated
Nom noms?
0:21 "She's been fed" thanks to my usual noob team, thanks riot!!
alguien mas le recordo a nimona esta wea?
Sorry As a Destiny 2 player, I liked the video immediately after I saw "Feeding frenzy".
LEEEEEEEETSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The flashy art kind of reminds me of Nimona and I'm all here for it
love the jinx and nimona vibes. heard people on twitter were going nuts about her being a loli, but to me it seems like shes bigger than the adult men. love them ticc thighs tho
is tthat.. is that a.. is that a fruit ninja reference
Looks like someone really liked Nimona, huh
💀 dang riot got rated R quick I like this
Briar’s pop up in the client scared me. 🤣
Firdst!
someone on the animation team really liked hobie in atsv
feeting frenzy
That's just melissa from mobile legends bruh
Not a huge fan of the uwu quirky borderlands teen girl voice but the champ design otherwise seems cool.
not da minecraft door sound effect 💀
Reminds me so much of Nimona but more bloody murdery.
0:08 hear me out guys...
would have expected noxus to try and convince a vampire to join their army rather than lock up in maximum security and leave mostly alone
Dang and i just uninstalled after the removal of Arena. The game is too toxic for me to play with 9 other people. No thanks.
referencia a nimona? xd
it reminds me greatly of shalltear bloodfallen. in ALL the ways, smh.
she gives me nimona vibes and i love it
NIMONA?!
Sylas + Jinx had a babygirl
why does she sound so weird
bro they gave her boots 💀 fr boots xd WHERE FEET
Uh... Nimona...? Is that you..?
Cinematic before were better ....
Very... Nimona-esque  Me likey
WTF happened with Evelyn?
NIMONAAAAAAAAAAAA
0:58 is that the question mark ping I'm hearing??
This is totally inspire from Ninoma😅
Noxian jinx vibe going on
🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶
cant wait to see what ctrl+c ctrl+v they made for this champ
I can fix her
This is a canon event
you still have a scorpion to rework...
I can fix her.
When I watch it I see Nimona in my head
Sweet but psycho ❤️
jinx so crazy
Cool Character.
She looks pretty Teen-ish, which is nice from the impressions she initially gave hahah
Hope she release in wr too we need more like this champ in wr
love this new champ "jinx2"
Meanwhile in Piltover...
Vampire Nimona? 0.o
Sooo... Nimona meets Shalltear Bloodfallen?
Jungle?
the sound effects when chasing the elevator better be in the game. that was crisp asf
i dont play league but the character designs and cinematics are flawless
I love it when they tried to hide the gruesome part with fruits, pinks and doodles.
Weirdo.
i was loading in to the game when the 0:57 pings came in
NIMONAAAAA??????
Apperently Jinx and Qiyana had a child
I swear, I love that personality.
Oh look it's vex + jinx, how creative 🙄
She gives me VERY strong Nimona vines
That was so metal!
So she's basically Nimona?
gonna be op with fleet footwork
Pretty much tokyo ghoul here
Mommy
kinda looks like shalltear when shes in blood frenzy
Ok so vampire jinx?
The design team totally watched Nimona on a friday night and said "we got this"
Nah 💀💀💀
I hate her already. Don't wanna fight against this champ so I'm going to play this champ
Is it me or does she have the air of Nimona but crazier
Is that a demon, hemomancer, or vampire?! Either way, cool.
Vampire jinx with a fruit ninja theme
Glad they finally added Jack to the main game!
For those who have seen the movie Nimona: That, that vibw she is giving me, lovit
Tai lung?  Is it your scape scene?
this is worst champion cinematic ever u made. Wp riot
Even though she looks kinda ugly in this cinematic, I'm glad that she doesn't look like a kid
Random Riot employee : guys I just finished a comic book by the name of Nimona can we make a champion like her Riot : Okay what's her personality like Random Riot employee : Like Jinx Riot : Say no more It will be a kid vampire Random Riot employee : But I wanted her to be like a shapeshifter Riot : We already have one now go make the champion
Epic Nimona plagiarism!
She looks like Shalltear's true vampire form :v
Another hyper mobile champ that can hit me from across the map with a single move and execute their whole combo off of it and delete my team? I expect nothing less than fun and engaging gameplay from our friends at RiOt GaMeS
Is it me? Or does Briar sound like Ella Purnell?
no guys you cant fix her
I think she and Jinx might understand each other
I like her yup I like her
reminds me of shalltears demon form from overlord
Eve and Vlad’s child?
Nimona vibes
she's very similar to tiny tina from borderlands, similar voice too
mehhh...😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
spiderman across the spiderverse style animation
Friend?
Looking so insane! Briar is really a menace. I'd be a friend to her.
i'm the only one that think that this animation is like the movie Nimona. Even the character is like her
LOL Her: raaah🤪. Arcane her: RAAAH😥
lol, need to see more of escape buddy the janitor and her. Love the cinematic
Wait I've seen this type of vampire.... This is bloddy Shalltear Bloodfallen
welp, these character could have been an impressive one. too bad i guess
THE PING NOISES AHAHAHA
i loved this trailer, the art direction was pretty cool
Did i just heard a danger ping sound?
Indie company.
I was expecting a crewpy child from the splash art but i ended up with nimona instead
Another dashing around assassin
she thinks she's nimona
Basiically sylas but femal and with vampire powers
who was that voice actor? kinda reminded me of nimona
Господи Риоты я вас и ваших художников просто обожаю. Вы лучшие
you think im playing? legally off course
Star guardian Briar waiting room
Ahhh great another yi
Whats the point of her lock if she can willingly removed it, so it would seem?
I dislike the direction they took, I personally would've preferred a starved vampire that went insane due to her lack of nutrition. I really like the non-insane character design, especially the weird eyes and chains, but they really missed the mark in the end. At least we can call it an improvement to Kai'Sa and Seraphine.
Well someone watched Nimona
.
she give me so much of Nimora vibe
this champion remind me another game named "Soulstice" . the protagonist also have the same name : Briar ... what a coincidence...
Riot sua linda
So vampirre jinx?
i like her personality
this is for those with foot fetish
white melee jinx
Can we have Nimona? We have nimona at home.
Thanks I hate it
My favorite part is when she came out and was like "Thats my friend, its morbin time"
Anyone else think of Nemona while watching this? The chaotic energy, the pink energy, the seeing a random guy as their friend and helping them out in a very random and violent way?
no feet?
"Alright my name's Hobie, Hobie Brown. I was bitten by a- wouldn't you like to know, get what I mean? And for the last three years I've been the one and only- wait, wait, waitwaitwait wait wait. You think I'm gonna show my secret identity? Come out of it. That is when I'm not playing shows, antagonising facists, staging unpermitted political action/performing art pieces. OR, having a laugh at the pub with the mandem. I'm not a role model, I was briefly a runway model. I hate the AM, I hate the PM, I hate labels, I'm not a hero, because calling yourself a hero makes you a self-mythologizing narcissistic autocrat." Ahh animation
When i saw her transformation i tought abot Primal, the ps2 game
she can drink my blood too if she wants to
It gave me full Nimona from Netflix vibes
Bet there's already a rule34 page
it looks like nimona
Awesome
This champ will definitely not be getting a weird welcome because of her feet, personality and appearance !
Yes. That's my queen
OMG Tiny Tina Vibes
WTH JINX?
Is this champion Jungle, Top or Mid?🤔🤔🤔
Maybe rework skarner
It's givin nimona vibes. I love it!!!
League needed a Cannibal ! She's got the Sakura eyes🥴😏  We dont have enough mentally ill champions🎉 🏳️‍🌈🌈k Sante  Singed Annie Pyke Jinx Viktor ...  all of these aint ill enough😅 We needed somebody even more crazy anyway
Great Design, absolutely stunning cinematic but why does she need to have that bubbly slightly stupid personality? I don't want her to be edgy either. She could have been just a good monster with reasons to be on. Not another jinx type or even vex.   We desperately need more serious champs in LoL.  The "ohhhh I'm kinda quirky" stuff is a bit too much latley
aaaa ok nimona then
Riot animation team: how do we make this family friedly?
Loooooove it!
on god this comment section is filled with bots praising this video like we weren't scammed
the splash art reminded me to watch nimona, and now here I am watching more nimona I guess
*SHE'S MORBING*
Tiny Tina energy
0:59 teammates when yosuo spam level 7 mastery get 1 kill after 12 death:
... did some one at riot watch Nimona?😂
So basically: "What if: Jinx from Noxus"
Briar and jinx are gonna be best friends, i already know it
That sh** will have 3 dashes and will execute you  when riot makes a support they give you a boy with shield
Wouldnt mind a series of mini eps featuring frenzy and friend going on adventures
A'right so nobody's gonna mention the Kongfu Panda vibes right here. A'right.
Is this the new Warwick update ?
Am I the only one who’s getting Jinx 2.0 vibes with her personality?
I hope the community does nothing out of the norm
Dont know why but my brain thought LOL collab with that fish game 😂
feet
If you know, you know
She's Giving Nimona Vibes
This has Nimona vibes, I love it!
i cant wait for briar otps to put feet in their name, imagine getting inted by feet warrior
Qiyana on her first period :/
Vladimir daughter? ;D
Si she is a crazy lady with the same voice actrees as Jinx? That its another crazy lady? Mmmmm i dont like iiit😅😅
I did not LIKE that.
its like a mix between nimona and jinx lol
Nimona on drugs
Nimona get out of there, thats not ur movie
100 dashes and counting…
Getting serious Nimona and Death (Puss and Boots: TLW) vibes.
¿Y lo vampiro esta donde?
I can fix her😂
Nimona
where are her feet ?
I can fix her
Netflix Nimona?
BUENARDOOO
Feet
WOULD
So coooollll. I wonder if she’ll have a eating mechanic like Cho.
I love that nimona vibe
I have a feeling the rioters who made this cinematic are fans of Nimona lmaooo
wait, is that, jinx voice actress?
Oh god Another crazy girl on my list. 😏
I can´t wait for rule34
wait wheres McQueens crocks?
it's like nimona without shapeshifting and jinx crazy...
So we get jinx from noxus.🤣
R34 artists gonna be crazy with this one 💀
Looks like someone really liked  Nimona
so...  is she a jinx for genshin impact players ?
I want to be that guy
Let me guess, she has at least 3 dashes
r34 artist on his way alr
FEET FEET FEET FEET FEET FEEEEEEEETTTTT 🔥🔥🔥
When Jinx and vex useing the fusion technique
These people so annoying comparing her with that "Nimona" bro wtf
Would
Shalltear + Jinx ?
she definitely looks like she doesn’t need to equip a bloodthirster…
I loved the energy this trailer had to offer. I usually don't get hyped for champions, but I'm looking forward to play her
Then something just snapped, something inside of me.
i think she can go with amumu, be friend forever
Ngl this design is kinda trash, no hate though, just an offbrand Jinx
Nimona??????
So we got a Jinx 2.0
from a creepy vampire champion to a crazy young jinx 2.0
I can fix her or she will ruin me, either way it's a W
Skarners rework after a couple of years- of course not.Release another  piece of sh69it, of course yes.  Judging by the comments, this world is doomed-there are too many idiots.
I feel like Briar and Jinx could be besties 🤣
Shalltear from Overlord , nice
Nimona fazendo escola
see? now this is good.
beautifull animation as allways...cant wait too see her story....looks like the style on nimonas trailer...awesome....her personality and syle looks like shaltear from overlord + nimona
someone should ask leaague charectar designer what he has been looking at recently
As a Chogat main, i have found somting new too now people
Her growls and grunts sound just like Mileena from Mortal Kombat. No wonder I like her so much. Oh, and cause she's a vampire
She stuck with Escape Buddy until the very end :D
So.... Nimona
Jinx energy.
Why is Jinx eating people now?
JinXXXXX Fans Will Be Happy
Is it just me or the beginning sounds like medic from tf2 saying “soldier”
Oh look, we found the creepy girl who shows up in all of those XQC meme spooks.
i really like the aesthetic of this cinematic but again... she is just "ANOTHER JINX"
Is this jinx from future
Bro why Gollum from mist mountains there
she really pulled a Tai Lung there
Reminds me of more Naive, less bitter Jinx for some reason.
nice, i like that.
On her way to Zaun to meet Jinx
sit on my face pls
looks nothing like the splashart.Kinda happy to be honest its not that way,wouldnt want another loli
This is a literal gremlin. The don't feed sign included
Oh no, another champ with countless jumps and other bs mechanics that you can't escape from... Edit: After i saw what she does, it's even more fked up than i thought and i was kinda on point😅💀
Give me Spotify
She hangry gremlin! Love it 😊
She has big nimona energy~
I loved the aesthetics, I expected something more creepy but it was a kind of "Jinx" trailer, Briar's look is nice, nothing special, but not bad either
MORBING CUNNY UOHHH 😭  (I don't play the game.)
She gives Nimona vibes
Literally just Netflix's "Nimona" as a League of Legends character...   10/10, I want to play as her now.
Super punk rock! I'm loving it!
Noxus Jinx
Meh..? Like ok but like no? Its like having cheese frozen or melted. Its just not it...
me gusta el pan
Where foot ?
Cool to see how riot has improved their direction and cinematics post arcane
Huh, yet another well done Cinematic, very well done, reminds me a bit about Arcane, I wonder if that means anything? Anyway, interesting Character, are she supposed to be the Jinx of Noxus? Actually, kind of reminds me of a mix between Jinx and Nimona, for some reason.  So, she’s been locked up all this time? I wonder for how long? And if her escape was an accident or planned? And most of all, i wonder what her escape will mean for the Lore of Runeterra?
"Rawr" -briar
Briar is like if Jinx and Nimona are mixed together to form her.
She's remind me to Gorillaz 😂😂😂
glad they didnt use ai for this one
Briar can i be also your friend  😭 👉👈
she reminds me of nimona ! so cute i love her
Who is her friend? We need answears
JINX.... BUT MEELE ???  lol i kinda liked her dseign on the splash art now i just think its pretty UNORIGINAL... its just "ANOTHER JINX". i was Really expecting a BLOOD THIRSTY CRAZY AND DARK GIRL but k
Why the pink blood again riot?
Feeding Frenzy???? Is that the name of the game from Capcon?
Jinx's voice Warwick Mobility
IT SHOULDVE BEEN ME
Jinx 2.0 Someone has problem with new idea
It's undead jinxs vibe
Its like nimona
Maybe im to old for league but i really see a big diferences between new and old champs. Like u cant compare this with ekko, aurelion, velkoz cinematics. In the past was so hype but i didnt feel the same way today.
Major Nimona vibes. I LOVE her 😂
She needs to be in Project L
So... she's basically jinx that has blood lust. My wish of having her someone as close to as lenore from castlevania or any of the vampire queens from van helsing has been crushed.. but at this point, I no longer care. I now get what you mean Necrit....
shalltear type vibes
Big jinx energy
Warframe,Valkyr .....
It's just a Vampire jinx
Nemona at home:
its like the netflix adaptation of Nimona.
This animation better than whole lol community
She went goblin mode
Arcane boutta be crazy
I love her, she's perfect.
I need her in League of legend wild Rift  please give me this champion there she's me Type of the Dark Chaos top!!
12+  wher is old good , blood , death and fighting scenes this is chinese censorship  i dont like that
Shalltear overlord
The way her weapon reforms looks so cool!
Pure Nimona vibe
Riot's obsession with female champions is unbelievable.
Big Nemona vibes.
Mobile legends is better
She really doesnt come of as creepy... kinda edgy more like it...
I wonder if he's just as crazy as Jinx I think I think they look a lot alike Barbarians / Laughing and Likes to ruckus 😂
Watchu doing escape buddy?
I would appreaciate Riot making less of these anime children champs. I sometimes dont know if i play some cringe sketchy comedy parody or a normal game. Ive been so hyped when ive heard some dark vampire character is joining, like Vladimir but real vampire, and we end up getting this champ for 9yo children.
Vampire Jinx
This is it! 🐾
why does she look like Shalltear from Overlord?
ty Fortiche
I can fix her.
Jinx 2.0
Holy, this is a really cool style, like Hobie Brown's style
it feels like nimona
Is this Jinx's voice actor from Arcane?
This feels like a blatant ripoff of nimona
lại tướng 2000 năm nữa rồi
reminds me a lot of shalltear from the anime Overlord
She looks very cute and funny            😭
Expected Witch noises from L4D got a more degraded-psycho version of the original Jinx, honestly wish she was actually a really dark champion similar to FIddle.. this feels like they turned an amazing horror concept into another colorful weirdo type of character even with her murdering everyone
top teir animation 👌
“We will be releasing new champions less often and focus on champion updates and reworks.” Also riot:
Movie = Reality 0/10
Silas+Jinx=
worst champion ever
So Just Noxus Jinx cant lie a lil disappointed in that
Cinematic giving nimona and hobie vibes. Anyway XD love the cinematic!
como que el trailer se fue a lo aestheic demaciado  en si se nota la falta de trama a un personaje que pudo tener buen lore  poner esas imagenes   para censurar sangre y muerte  muy mal cuando siempre en las cinematicas te muestra lo crudo que es como la cinematica de trhes  hasta la de jinx  tenia mejor forma de mostrar la locura
❤❤
everything is cool but why is the blood pink
She sounds like Rebecca from Cyberpunk
First jinx and now briar
"Neeeed more fooood"....quality writing.
love the crazy  champs ^^ they are weard af and  cute  at the same time :D thats why i cant get girlfriend ;(
Jinx 2.0
What if briar and jinx meet? It would be chaos
Why it isn’t me ??????? That should’ve been me!!!!!
There goes my hope of another cool horror champion 🤷‍♂
Here is every time you can see her feet 0:32 0:35 0:38 0:42 0:47 0:54 1:06 1:14 1:18
mt fofinha qnd sai da forma de vampiro
Rule 34 is gonna have a field day with this one.
Is like nimina and More caos wujuuuu nice champ 😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Hands up, who else got mad Nimona vibes from this trailer? 🙋
Good
New champ : *Breathes* Riot : Giga nerf that champ
Feet
WW's kid?
so vampire nimoma?
I hate nimonia
Man, i love Brian
Man I just hope there won't be any rules for this champ😏
why do i simp for her already?
Nimona?
When did Jinx become a vampire?
@necrit should be happy :)
futa briar
Feet
i can fix her
WOULD
This reminds me of Nimona and im here for it
Perderam a chance de fazer um trailer assustador, brutal e sombrio
Nimona vibes 100%
This is giving me massive Nimona vibes lol, great cinematic
Noxian Gwen. Yeaaah they nailed it
Me recordó a nimona de por la música y las escenas de pelea
kungfu panda reference noice
Jinx got new friends
SHE IS BRUTAL AND GORE ITS SPECTACULAR CANT WAIT TO SEE HER IN ACTION😈😈😈☠️☠️☠️
Where feet?
I don’t like the jinx vibes because feels redundant.
Dumbest attitude and dumbest voice acting! This is another potential totally wasted. Most disappointing
Nimona vibes
She's less vampire, more Ghoul like
"Welcome to the death realm.  And get BONKED"
THICC THIGHS
Great, another 14 year old.
I kinda see the inspiration from Nimona from this new champ
okok not baddd at alll
its briar time
I LOVE HER SO MUCH
She remind me of MK Mileena and Venom
Sooooooo... Legal??
I think I might need to start maining Jax
Looks like Nimona, fights like Warwick.
She's giving Nimona
Report prison guards for feeding enemy Briar
Reminds me of shalltear in her second form
The danger pings were a nice touch. lmao
definitely not inspired by Nimona
další kokotská broken postavička
"U sure she's a vampire?"  - Top mains, probably
Oooooh...Nimona
feet 😋😋
¿Nimona? Is you?
Literally just Jinx but in Noxus👍🏻
Suddenly I want to draw her.
POV: Shalltear Bloodfallen has enterend LoL
Yo I can't believe they added a gawr gura to the game.
twitter e women will for sure not use this character for their very modest cosplays!
Just saw the gameplay, this looks like another 400 ys kit, this champ can be only busted or so bad that she is not in the game, hope for the second one
Blood-starved machine in a feeding frenzy
She looks neat.
TE AMO BRIAR, YA ERES MI MAIN ANTES DESDE Q SALGAS
nooooooooooooo she has sandal
Developers barely disguised foot fetish:
Darkinfolk is eating good tonight bois
whoever made this champ definitely was a big fan of Nimona
I need her and Jinx to become friends in Arcane RNN
arcane style
so generic
epic
Jinx +  Warwick 🥱
She gives jinx vibes honestly
Rule 34: mi name is barry allen
Her crazy state reminds me of nimona movie.
So every one have pink blood?
looks like league was inspired by the nimona movie huh
BEST CINEMATIC IN AGES!!!
FODA!
Give me the mmorpg.
feels like Jinx?
Sooo the noxus version of jinx?
GIVE US THE FEET BACK
Sooooo fon 🔥
Great... another assassin. Just was was needed.
rawr XD
This cinematic looks like it comes from Nimona
Briar and Jinx would be best of friends, but you gotta wonder who's more insane a literal vampire or a blue haired chick
The Vampire Nimona awake something in my inside 😳
Thanks I hate it
Jinx has a new sister!
Crazy and adorable, i love her 😍 !!!
If Nimona was rated R haha
She is giving Jinx but Noxus and I love it
She has that Nimona vibe. I love it
All we get is new champions and no new contents. I really hope that League of Legends gets a big update for the game's main screen and some cool changes to the map. I've been a bit tired of seeing the same green map for such a long time.
Everyone act surprised!
Riot must have watched Nimona lol.
i need her to make me worse
"she's been fed" already setting the tone for ranked lul
What a cool new champ, I'm sure the community will do nothing twisted or perverse with this champ
yay akali samira combo so fun
I though it would be Irelia again xD
Creepy thirsty prisoner feet vampire gf <3
I really dislike listening to jinx in another champ that is so similar in body type perhaps. Gets me totally out of the fantasy of the vamp. Maybe a filter or summat.
Oh my, someone decided to combine Jinx and Evelynn! With a pinch of Warwick. Fun indeed!
Rule 34 😂😋😋😋
Riot clearly has favorites and theyre all the champions designed by august
Champ for the girls and femboys cosplay it.
So cute
IS THIS THE STUDIO THAT DID NIMONA????? HELLO??????????
She literraly sounds like jinx
yup, this cinematic made me change my mind. i love her now
Nimona
She looks awesome, but I wish her voice was scarier, darker, demonic, etc. Its still just a little girl voice. I wish they went a bit harder on the horror aspect.
Huh. A vampire that doesn't get burned by the sun.scary
I'm here for the FEET
Goblin Jinx goes hard
So yall watched Nimona huh ?
Too much Jinx vibes
So Briar is, what if "Nimona" was a Gremlin? I like it.
this video has got to be one of the coolest things riot has done in a while
she's like Shalltear hhaha
My Queen
So you guys watched Nimona too. Cool.
yes, i am that down bad.
This is missing someting, I cant quite put my toe on it tho
VERY fun cinematic
Root might have been thinking Should we add another crazy crazy champion like Jynx Or it may affect Jynx's fan base.
They pulling off another Jinx 😭😭
seem related to blood magic (vlad)
Not what I thought at all
Wait, a new champ? Naafiri just got released. Cool!!!
This has Nimona vibe written all over it and I’m all here for it!
am I the only one who thought of V from Murder Drones when I saw this video?
Smesh
great, just what we needed, another blood thirsty, psychotic female Harley Quinn like character. I mean we dont already have like 15 in the pool. But hey, Riot has a type.
I can fix her
is it just me or her face looks so much like Powder ?
my new main, evelynn and briar
Trailer looks good, however I hate that they did a Jinx 2.0 out of this champ. Her voice doesn't fit her at all either.
Didn't knew they would put Nimona on LoL
Jinx and her could be good friends hahahah
really like the cinematic, the aestetic makes me think of Nimona
rule has already 9805 posts about it
The janitor on the lift scene reminds me a lot of Tai Lungs escape sequence
when does she reach pbe?
When I see New lol cinematic. I click as fast than The Flash 😂
it's giving borderlands vibes
man imagine how broken she ll be
From cute vampire to psychopath in a second
shalltear?
So jinx watched twilight and now is a Vampire?
I liked her better when she was Jinx
1:13 It should've been me not him
For some reason she reminds me of nimona.
I see the Riot team watched Nimona!
But how broken will she be, is the bad broken of aurelion, the bs broken of every new champ or will she just be a fun one to play once in a while and fall into the mediocrity of half the roster
Weren’t we supposed to get a monster champ? Or did I miss that one?
So league IS cringe now...i thought it was just a rumors.....
Warwick if was a girl
that not funny ;-;
So im guessing she is another champ that has a dash xd cant wait
I am not that much into Vtubers, but I can't be the only one who thought Gawrrura was being added to the game, looking at the thumbnail, right?
She looks so good on this and in the splashart (not the feet lol) but in game she looks so booooooring Like genshin impact booring
Nimona. . . .
Who decided to clone jinx and combine her with Vlad?
"I can fix her"
So she’s Jinx but a vampire? Theme wise at least
Jinx wtf 😢😂
Jinx’s rival???? You’ll never be her!
she is SO Jinx coded
Even though we got all spoiled, this was EXCITING AND SO GOOD ! NOW THAT'S HYPE     Pls don't make her weird, she just an innocent lady :(
is that Jinx  voice actor?
I wish vayne kills her
Gotta Say... Jg Diff
Oh, so its Jinx But She's A Vampire
Nimona ?
Nimonaaaa
That's probably her ult, breaking the chains or w.e those are and just going full on blood hungry
Jinx 2.0
gotta hate chinese politics when blood is pink
So she is Noxus Jinx?
Doesn't really live up to her bio in terms of creepiness honestly. She's literally just kinda jinx 2 in terms of personality if you ignore her character development in arcane
Nimona animation vibes 👌
''Escape BUDDYY?!'' LMAO🤣
Big nimona energy
league took the two most popular champion types, monsters and lolis, and put them together. This is why they pay you the big bucks, Riot August. 10/10
Shalltear bloodfall
It's fine but kinda underwhelming compared to nafiri cinematic. Better than in game model cinematic urgh let's not go back to that
Literally Nimona Character
Shalltear Bloodfallen - Overlord
Has a lot of Nimona vibes
0:40 I like this. I thought this was creative
Briar is literally your crazy ex girlfriend that is going to hunt you down to the ends of the Earth just to get revenge on you.
It's like Warwick and Jinx have a baby together. Crazy like Jinx and it has Warwick's bloodlust.
VLADIMIR and JINX have some explaining to do.
Alright, who was the concept creator who watched Nimona before submitting their idea.
So what you're saying is the brace does nothing
As an Evelynn main, I think I found my new babe to main ❤
Nimona ispired this character and I'm here for it!
In the leaked splash art, she looked cute, here she is just ugly
I do like her vibe a lot. A complete gremlin, just what league was missing!
blood is pink now? to sell to china ?
If Death Wolf taught me one thing, it's that whistling is a baaaaad sign...
I'm don't like seeing these many dashes on a teaser
Cant wait to perma ban it
Huh. When I see the leaked splash at the first time, I was worry. But I really like her personality, craziness, and the way she show some of abilities and frenzy.
we could've gotten a ancient vampire but instead we got jinx 2.0
Meh, dissapointed
So she's like shalltears from overlord? That's literally amazing!! I wish they would put her in wildrift since I don't have pc
i love this style
lord forgive me
lol
Nimona
Man, they could have gone with something A LOT cooler. Instead we got another manic pixie dream girl like Jinx...... cooooool
Briar is Tai lung reincarnated as loli vampire
Her and Jinx have a lot of similarities and I love it
Arcane animation style, top.
major nimona vibes
jinx in chain
Where's her grippers
Surely this community won't do anything weird when it comes to fan arts of her.  Also thank you for not turning her into an actual child.
In my opinion she's more of a monster than a vampire. Not interested anymore tbh.
Let me guess... She's quirky
Its a cool aesthetic but also everything i didnt want this champion to be, and frankly feels massively out of place
So...they bassicaly made Nimona a League of Legends champion?
wtf is this childish bs
I can fix her
She makes Jinx look like an innocent schoolgirl who goes to catholic school
Jinx became a vampire.
So Jinx plus Zoe plus Vladimir. I like it.
This gives heavy Nimona vibes, I love it
Did they just use Jinx VA?
cring
My wife!
That's the first time since Jinx that I really like the crazyness. Hope she is fun to play.
Bro can't believe they added Nimona as a league champion. She's so cool and refreshing, kinda disapointed at her not sounding scarier. But I feel like she and Jinx would get along very well.
it reminds me of Nimona
Thanks Riot, now a Jinx but hunger, its so original!
Oh that's a nice artistic direction
...No AI generated cinematic this time? What happened? ;)
Shalltear... hmmmm.
We were robbed of what could have been one of the best reveals in league of legends.
So she is jinx attitude,Warwick game mechanic and sylas background?
This has a jinx feel to it
Crazy? I was crazy once, they locked me in a room, a rubber room , a rubber room with rats, Rats make me crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once, they locked me in a room, a rubber room , a rubber room with rats, Rats make me crazy. Crazy? I was crazy once, they locked me in a room, a rubber room , a rubber room with rats, Rats make me crazy. ......
another broken champ i cant wait
cool vampire champ is xd so random girl? its literally jinx in a cosplay but cinematic os amazing ofc. Just design is really genshin
Where feet?
Hey you know what the game needs ? a crazier jinx!
this is reallllyy cool i adore how she looks in frenzy, I just hope her personality gets different enough from jinx
Jinx new friend?
hope jinx 3.0 will be better then 2.0
I can fix her
so much blood, and so much speed, and maybe so much bug ...
the cutscene evelynn deserved
She protects her friends.
why yes Riot, I too watched Nimona....
Looking forward to seeing her on the rift (not looking forward tôt eh first two weeks of fighting everyone to play her)
crazy?
I love her😢
Where feet?
is she suppose to be the new jinx!?!? there is only one jinx in my life aand thats jinx!
え、なんかコレジャナイ感……。
Nimona going berserker?
She's like Tai Lung and Nimona child
Anime loli vampire Jinx
it look like Shalltear from Overlord and i love it
She gives me harley queen vibes
0:58 when you spam ping your team not to fight but they do anyways:
The animation is Mind-blowing!!!! I already love her, definitely gonna be one of my favorites 😃😃💙💙
This is just Jinx but vampire...
Arcane Vibez !
rule 34 artist i call upon thee
Don't Starve
What
the cinématique is banger
Am i the only one who think riot should keep new champs to a maximum of 1 per year and just focus on existing champs cause they all deserve more love
morbius X league is wild
Sickk
I can fix her
Gorillaz Jinx with Qiyana silhouette
Would be funny if that escape buddy traveled with her in lore lol. Some cartoony duo type of dynamic
Why does this animation remind me of Nimona?
YES YES YES YES
Jax mains drooling
Love the ping go back sound when the soldiers saw her!!
new simp mode activate
Virei mono
i really love the rock style music when she berserk then goes back to a whistle melody when she calm also a rocksatr vampire is new to mee and super cool
Mfs (me included) be like I can fix her
Idk who is crazier jinx or her 💀
Ela parece o Curupira 😂
This looks like Jinx meets Warwick meets Vladimir mixed with Spiderman into the spiderverse... And I LOVE IT!
literal nimona analog
Men encanta como no todo se filtra 🤗🤗🤗
Riot that is litearly Shaltear From Overlord💀❤️🔥
bari-bari gusha-gusha baki-baki gokun  (if you have the reference you're a beautiful person)
Very dumb
why no feet
Riot give me this now !!
Oh! Come on!! where's that hot mommy briar splash art that was the one i was expecting riot! Why??? Just whyyyy? I thought we finally have a rival for lady demitrescu but no you guys just go with a loli design!!!
I summon thee, Skyen, to over-annalize every frame of this  sorry for bad english, lov u
Yeah league is geared so heavy toward horny , nonsocial people it's so cringy. "haha that's my friend i kill now". is some middle school boys view of a women
Whoa totally unexpected that her ult puts her ina  frenzy
She is crazy but i can fix her
She gives me cave pirhana vibes ngl
Nimona on the rift
Another crazy biach
To make such a character creepy, with gloomy cinematics as it was with Warwick - no. To make such a creature another stupid, funny teenager with a childlike spontaneity, but very dangerous? - yes. It seems that we have begun to forget about what real darkness looks like.
melee jinx
Players: We want more monster champions. Riot: We gotchu! Here is a MONSTER loli cute ayaya girl champion! Bruh, i swear to god the devs are weirdos and the players who like this are too.
trash cinematic
Конфу панда?
well since I haven't liked any new champ lately, hello new main.
Thank you Riot for new Jinx. I m really waiting for new "content" with her.
Dentro 👍🏽
liike the use of in game pings in the guards
Kinda annoying that almost every champion Riot releases is either waifu/husbando or some quirky/whimsical character (and in this case it seems they tried to go for both).
She looks like Nimona
Her voice reminds me of Arcane Jinx!
They just keep cooking so much f****** good theme
She doesn´t feel very unique as she´s basically Jinx
So what do you guys think?  Will she scare Jinx?  Or will they be best buddies?
Feet!
Wow another character that you didn't even try to make it interesting. Thank you riot for making this game more for dogs (naafiri best example).
lo veo: esta rotaaa NOOOOO NERFENLA al segundo 000000.1 cuando salga, *lo nerfean* NOOOOOOOOO el campeon no sirve para nada que aburrimiento MEJOR juego YI
So just... Jinx again?
I really wished it was more a horror creepy vibe champion rather than Jinx 2.0 in term of first impression
Please dont make her woke
totally a wife material like jinx
can any one please tell me why her whistling reminds me of Rammstein
Another cartoon looking character with 'Marvel hero (funny)' personality. Do people really like this?
Wish they made her less talkative and more scary.. Anyways, would.
Jinx 2.0
R34 here I come
Shalltear copied xd
Idk whay we did to deserve the two last banger trailers but pls riot keep cooking
after this my apetite on her rule34 has disappeared...
Vampire girl and the escape friend she's emotionally dependent on.
Ok riot. You win this time.
IS SHE AP OR AD?
WHY PINK BLOOD, RIOT WE ARE NOT KIDS GIVE US RED BLOOD
I was hoping she will be creepy but  she's just cute :/
good old jinxwick
heyo nimona ?
So the new champ is the un-targetable friend that runs places to get Briar to attack? Perfect champion to introduce new friends to LOL.
WE gave her blood .. or she took our blood. dont click her too many times on the client monkaS
banned until 3 nerfs updates comes
Omg riot that danger sound whahahaha
good to see riot still got it
Gives off Nimona vibes
Hello Shaltear XD
Jinx and sylas fusion
So my guess is she is either in the Bloodstone line or the Fright night
She gives off Nimona vibes XD
Little goose and Tai Lung vibes
Still think a Blood Lust Beast would be cooler then a LOLI, tho you do you Genshin Impact... Oh... Wrong Game... LEAGUE OF WEEBS
So we have to buy anti healing items on all games now and forever
this can be the single charater ya'll did good in a long time after the leavers
okay this reminds me a lot of arcane
Yo guys did you see it? on 0:31 you can see that Briar have the Shard of Violence :o
Jinx 2.0
Que clase de nimona es esta jajaja
SHOULDVE BEEN ME AT THE END
Shalltear???
she got shoes?!?!? COWARDS.
This champ remindds me of Shaltear Bloodfallen
Omg shee issss cuteeeeeeeee
She is taller than i thought
She gives me huge Nimona vibes
looks like someone been watching Nimona huh
another crazy champ, I love her already.
man these new champs doesnt stay true to the lore anymore
Loving the Fruit Ninja vibes
This is Tai Lung's escape all over again lmao
This animation is cringe
its giving tiny tina
OMG😮😮❤❤
another cringe edge lord champion designed for 14 yo who just discovered sao... great
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT OMG THIS ANIMATION IS AMAZING
is anyone getting sum nimona vibes on this one?
this giving me a nimona kinda vibes
It will be a champ that needs a charge for her like shyvanna.
Nimona vibes
This champ make jinx looks normal
cool now bring her to pbe
She sounds and act like nimona🤧
so bad
One of the best, ever
LOOOOOVEEEE it
What in the overlord Shaltear.
😭😭😭😭😭😭 Finally, Gawr Gura Red in LoL 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I really wish she was more animalistic than crazy like jinx. It would make her a lot scarier than goofy. Also her voice is like Jinx/Zoe with Vex's tones and honestly creepier Annie with high pitch screechy girly voice would do wonders. Kinda dissapointed.
Nimona?
Thank you So Much😢😊 Riot for The New Character not being vampire, Thank GOD not being vampire
I see I see
Nimona in literal bloodlust. I love it
Rule 34 Artist like this video!
lol it reminds me kinda of nimona XD looks interesting, cant wait for the release
Disney Riot finally transformed back to the good old Darksiders.
Amazing weird girl come to wild ridt
why is this so family freindly? also where r the feet
She reminds me of Nimona rofl.
Jinx from noxus
THE PING NOISE LMAO
so that thing she carries is a weapon? probably created in noxus. it cursed her in the process. she seems sympathetic to other "prisoners". she knows her enemy. cool.
i love her.. she my new main now
wow so fuuuuuuun! ky5 riot games ret@rd company
I likes the mutiple slash thingy, just like Rengar's old Q.
She got a very unique design, for sure
This is what happen when Vander impregnated powder.
She sounds like Jinx.
FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
Reminds of a certain vampire that worships a max leveled lich...
This reminded me of Spiderpunk's entrance, it's just so goood. Props to the animators 💯🔥
Is she the new "champ for pedos" everyone keeps talking about?
I'm sensing some Nimona inspration, which is not the direction I'd expected but go off I guess
i would
love it
I hope Cassiopeia will be reworked in 2024 and I hope they will make the following innovations.   1- Do not switch between the human and the snake state.  2-Having a weapon in hand (For example, a snake-shaped staff or the knife that Sivir is trying to kill.)  3-And finally, having snake hair like medusa.
Reminds me of Shalltear Bloodfallen from Overlord
She's so cool 😂
epic trailer
00:59 the pings sent shivers of ptsd down my spine
Idk what everyone else expected, but when I saw her in the first teasers, I already thought "crazy goblin girl" and that's what I see now! And I already love her, she's like the nightmare child of Vladimir <3
ah vampire jinx. It will take 34 milisecond until it's on rule... oh it's already there.
booba
SHE'S PERFECT
They really did an Arcane-style trailer for a new champ? ... I'm not eager for the champ but somehow feel excited for something else. I get the feeling Season 2 is close at hand :D
This gives off heavy Nimona vibes and I am here for it
0:59 the ping sounds
Hery, look at that... jinx and evelynn got a waifu baby... To be honest: I would lie if I say i am not ..."interested" in briar. But why, oh why riot does every female champion of yours look like a waifu? And sound like the charakter of a chibi anime... I dont get it. Another chance to create a scary and unique charakter flushed down the toilett.
She and Jinx would be the absolute best of friends.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEEEE!!!!
Jinx looks different here!
Shalltear getting isekaid to Runeterra lol
china cant show blood rip
I can imagine how much the dev team is scrambling because of the leaks. Must be rough.
ballanced
Dudee this was sickkk
that should be me, not him
Jinx "now eating humans" vibes. Good!
love all the crazy in league!
She's more crazy than Jinx
The Style really reminds me of Hobie from Across The Spiderverse, great work done
PLEASE SHE IS LITERALLY EVIL NIMONA
She sounds wayyyy too much like Jinx
Can i have a refund pls Thought jinx was a nutnub but this one ooooh  On another scale
200 Years and perfectly balanced
Great. Jinx and Nocturne had a baby.
It hasnt been so long since naafiri release and new legend already? So hyped!
jinx and evelynn have a child?
You're not you when you're hungry.
why is this gonna be warwick 2.0 but a cute anime girl.
Cannibalism 😋
Been try so hard to avoid all the leaks, worth it. This goes hard.
these ,,!'' ping sounds XDDD 0:58
Worse design in the world, anime fans will be happy
Jinx 2.0
Added to the list of hollow characters.
Isn't this Fortiche?
jinx wick
big L for giving her shoes
reminds me of shalltear bloodfallen from overlord
jinx²
Boa ela faz meu tipo, e parece meu nome tbm
the only feeding frenzy i know is about a fish
Another Silly Character with some fcked up lore
Nimona 2.0
GUYS SHE IS MINE PLEASE BACK OFF
meh sorry rito but no
Do not bring this guy into Wild Rift before Azir, Viktor, Viego and Gnar, I wait for these 4 since the game launch cause their are my main on LoL pc, but still seem like it impossible, if you bring this guy before those 4 i'll quit Wild Rift.
So its Warwick with Jinx' brain.
looks like arcane season 2 tease with that animation
Dam it Warwick use protection next time
Nimona?
so is she blind or what?
so... looks like I'm about to break my 7 year abstinence from league of legends...
Pumba… “SHES GONNA EAT ME!!!”
Could she be Jinx's sister? when she says in game "You think I'm Crazy? You Should﻿ See My Sister.." could be referring to her? :V
Nimona, is that you?
Somehow riot found a way to make a worst iteration of this champion imaginable.
Netflix Adaptation
Jinx has become the reverse
WE WILL PLAY BRIAR
epic
E - Briar dashes
she kinda remind me of "shalltear Bloodfallen" from the anime overlord
I like the fact that there is gore but also no gore at the same time...
jinx 2 eletric boogaloo
This reminded me a lot of Nimona, a movie that I absolutely loved!! I love the style chosen for this and Legends of Runeterra cinematics too. The Arcane look is truly gorgeous.
the grapes representing brains is brilliant
*riot release a new female champion* r34 artist : i am speed
I love herrrr 😍
More feet please😢
Dude that only watched nimona: mh im getting some nimona vibes.
Eu amo ela muito, eu amo ela demais
Apparently, one crazy, quirky girl is not enough for Riot
Where is the foot
It's very hard to not make her LIKE other people. But I wish they made her a fully feral being, who tries to save the slivers of humanity pitted against endless hunger.
Arcane/Jinx vibes
Nimona?
damm. that was a nice trailer
So its Vampire Jinx. Yawn. Also...this reveal does nothing to tell us about her lore.   That said, it is well made.
Solid 8/10 vampire gremlin, needs more creepy but otherwise she's great!
Jinx Part 2
Patas.
Cute
Personaje sacado de Nimona no puede ser aaaaa
Briar's trailer has Spiderverse animation and Lol Arcane Vibes Love it
This champion is literally designed to feed, my team can't even flame me for it anymore
YES YES YES YESSSSSSSS🎉
But she is not a little girl alright lol
Nimona
Blood magic is a helluva drug kids.
Wow. Nimona looks different.
She sound like Jinx.
JAK?
Very Good.
Okay the trailer is sick, her animations in this is SICK. just not a fan of the voice directing
Im getting ready for rule34
Im actually pretty hyped about this champ she looks pretty cool
What the... What happen to Jinx!!!??? Is she Vampire now!?
Nimona looks a little off
i can fix her
She is basically Zoe + Jinx + Vex
Arcane mood
Wow riot actually spent more than $10 to make a cinematic?
I can fix her!
Is this vampire Jinx?
naprawcie gre najpierw
basically she's Nimona?
Feels like Nimona.
I finally realized that Briar is based off of piranhas. Not proud it took me THAT long.
I can already see TB skyen admiring this animation
cool, more dashing assassins (y)
Oh my god I also watch nimona good to know I'm not the only one riot weres the new lore.
Briar's lore: Misery (probably) Briar's body: CPR Briar's face and personality: Reese's Puffs Perfectly balanced, as all waifus should be.
Attleast this one wasnt AI generated
RITO
isnt more voice actress who can play a crazy character than the jinx one?
this cinematic is absolutely amazing, kudos to every single person that worked behind this animation.
RIOT: hey can I copy your homework? NIMONA: Sure but make it a little different so no one will know. RIOT:
Idk why, all i can think is zombie jinx 🥱😴
i might be more excited for briar then i was for naafiri
At last, another Jinx-level unhinged character.
She's blood Jinx
wow totally didn't see her coming! what a surprise this champ is!
10/10 Cinematic, she looks lovely. I can't wait to see  her interactions with Evelynn or Jinx lol.   By the way at 58 seconds, are those the pinging sounds from the minimap in game? XD
FEEDING FRENZY?!?!?! Riot buying the rights?? lmao jk
Wait why i got chilling vibes when i heard whistling at the end, the same vibes i got from puss in the boots
I have a Rule34 feeling for this one
She's like Jinx on max steriods. lol
She seems like if Jinx was more unstable. Didnt think that could happen.
BRIAR MY BELOVED
She gives me hard Tokyo Ghoul vibes
Cookielol is eating good rn 😂
she doesnt seem as crazy as i was hoping her to be but its still great
How many dashes will she have
Crazy friend for Jynx
She could have been so creepy and cool. This is just Noxus Jinx
Tahm Kench has competition on the gluttony
1:13 NO, it should've been me, not him! That's not fair!
But in Indonesia not many people play this game
Reminds me of Tiny Tina.  Also this ain't leaked right? :)
shes not jinx crazy, shes medicated crazy <3 relatable
Wheres the feets riot 😔
Just beautiful. Love the stylization.
It's giving Nimona and Jinx vibes, not sure if I dig it...
Two banger cinematics in a row, Rito is coming back
She's literally nimona
seems as stupid as every other champ that has come out in the past year
It's giving Nemona!
Okay that is cool
Name of this hero
Such a cool aesthetic
What if Jinx was born in noxus
lmfao the spam pinging sounds
As much as I love the psycho crazy chick trope, I swear its overused. The voicelines will seal the deal for me. Cuz right now she ain't much.
Very Nimona-esque, i approve
God I wish that were me
I adore the aesthetics going absolutely nuts when she goes berserk and then snapping back after she calms down. It's not anywhere as creepy as the Warwick trailer, but I love how much energy she has.
noxus has a warwick too, neat
i think Shaltear Bloodfallen from Overlord hahaha😂
We love a feral queen
Ok she's cool u got me !
jinx after vi locked her up:
new op champ i see
Aba meets demon slayer lol
Her cinematic is so familiar...  Tai Lung:  "Finally! A Worthy Opponent! Our Battle Will Be Legendary!"
Nimona if it wasn't PG
Riot don't do this to me. I'm already weak to Jinx, if you add another crazy girl I'm done for
So Jinx but it's a vampire?
Very good riot
This ist actially a pretty Bad or unfitting Animation style
She: i want meat He: gotchu Also He: pulls out 🍆
This is so good wtf
aw what a cutie kinda like a noxian jinx :D
Ooooo shaltear is in the game
I can fix her
I CAN FIX HER
A cutieeee
I can fix her
i thought she will be more  like eve  plus she dont look like a vampire at all
Literally Nimona lol.
Primero
Change lol wild rift  name to lol mobile
So her personality is Jinx and her kit is Warwick... okay. The whole giant eyes / anime look / crazy punk rocker girl feels so out of place in Runeterra though... oh well.
what should Nimona have been like
I love it how they censored the gore and replace it with foods XD
Fun, and craazyyy
Nhe ...😒
So not a monster just Jinx 2.0.... Kinda disapontied.
Spiderverse like artstyle nice
New fruit ninja ad... CooL!
Oop another FLOP! 🎉
Thirsty MFs be like : "I can fix her"
Cho'gath: i like this tiny thing it understands me and my hunger.
Omg bro, can't believe they added Nimona as a league champion.
Is that Nimona refference?
Bro, i wanna be that guy.
100% inspired by Nimona.
would
Can't wait to eat
Oh wow another jinx 😦
First time I'm excited for a new champion in a while.. really love that she has the same vibes as Jinx tbh..
reminds me so much of nimona, i love it
I'm so proud of all of you! This animation is dope! And, tbh, I think I've just changed my mind, Briar is my new fav champ, she's adorable <3
She's Jinx x Zoe x Annie lol
cant wait to see her  ̶f̶e̶e̶t̶  gameplay
“She’s been fed!”, I appreciate the the transparency from now that she’ll be overturned and OP upon release LMAO
She is the kid of Jinx and Nimona😅😅
All I see is Jinx x Gear 5
No barefoot? Noooo0ooo i hate you riot!!!
me recuerda a mi ex cuando ve una oferta
Hi Briar🖤❤️ Ready to hunt on the battlefield! She has that hint of Jinx in her voice and I love her blood hungry personality
Yeah... You definitively can't feed this one!
i love laby
Shalltear Bloodfallen!
cartoon
WHERE ARE HER FEET, LIKE ON THAT PICTURE? WHEEERE?
make her cuter
Overlord, Shalltear when she turned into Honyopenyo
można dobry cinematic ? można.
waw...
Voice kinda off for this
OMG  ELLLA ES INCREIBLE , ME ENCANTA
Jinx in arcane season 3😩👍
She reminds me of Nimona, from a Nimona movie
Nueva mainnnnnnn, uffff que preciosura de campeón
glad to see the ripples of spider-man
Nimona 2.0
love it
God wish that Janitor was me
She has gremlin energy, and I am 100% here for it.
I thought Teemo it's the monster in game but this is... More
Evelyn 2000 . cool design
This is so bad
Jinx???
Interesante...
looks broken  nice
Riot her seferinde dandik çar çıkarmayı nasıl başarıyorsun anlatsana biraz kanka
shes awesome, fiddlesticks x jinx
So someone watched Overlord and thought shaltear should be in the game?
ATE
Okay my new queen, time to simp
Nimona likes too ❤
Wow gg
I need this !
Nimonaaaaa
Glad to see nobody is aking where's her barefeet.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is this jinx??? OMG
so basically, Jinx's bestfriend?
muito obm
If i had a nickel for every League champ that broke out of jail and used their shackels as their weapon, id have 2 nickels. which isnt a lot but its strange that it happened twice
Increíble
Briar really looks amazing and the cinematic is so cool 🦇❤
Gorillaz level of censored gore
I can fix her
dudeeeee i want her foot
Saw plenty of fan art of her before her reveal. Everybody love the crazy ones.
Loved the pings at the almost end 😂
OMG THAT'S AMAZING
A complete chaos gremlin, I love it
He’s one luck dude to be her friend :D
If Mary Jane succumb to her demonic self
Prestige Illaoi ? :(
😂 She's unhinged. I love her. ❤
She and Jinx could be besties!
Looks nothing like vampire
Interesting, now i cant wait for the champion Spotlight.
I can fix her
Necrit guessed the ult thing.
Riot be playing Fruit Ninja 🍓 🍉
No way that even vampire nimona is in the League 💀
Reminds me of nimona i love it!!
New crazy waifu?
This reminds me so much of Arcane and I love it!
Ok nimona
So basically they remade Jinx
jinx have a friend now XD
If I had a nickel for every female crazy psychopathic murderer in league that shows their murder in cool art styles I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice
No fue lo que me esperaba del campeón pero espero que haga algo parecido almenos en partidas
Mhh patas
literally Jinx
Interesting. Can't wait to see her gameplay
Exactly how I'd picture her.  The kind of people you highly prefer to have by your side and that you LITERALLY can have by your side. But... You gotta have some guts
Man i missed cinematics, beautiful cinematics...
Dayum she crazy 😍
It's alternative universe Jinx!
rip high quality trailer...
Façam uma animação de início de temporada tão boa quanto essa , por favor
No feet?
Shes so cuteeeee
Pretty sure Jinx and Briar would be good friends
k so... when can i play her on pbe
I can’t wait for the community to do absolutely nothing weird with this champ!!!!
Gahhh danm
Is she supposed to be young or something
oh my god that's gorgeous. i'm not sure if i'm completly down with the kind of childlike way of acting but i am so down to learn more she looks amazing design wise and very interesting with the blood magic.
Cinematic: Hungry and censored blood Fans: were is her foots?
This champion is terrible. But let's hope the Ink Mage will be unique and will have a real personality in desing and in game.
Just melee jinx. Boring and unoriginal.
Thanks for the jumpscare Briar lol
So nice!
1. Loving the Jinx vibes! 2. The "Fall Back" pings at 0:59 😂
Jinx x vex be like :v
Stylish
Love her personality when she is containt. That contrast gives her a certain creepyness but also charisma.
Someone in the dev team watched nimona xD.   I love it!
Briar, the Fruit Ninja
Vampire Jinx let's go
Would Leona ult one shot her? or what kinda vampire we dealing with here?
Am I tripping or does she kinda sound like Jinx too. Feels a lil too Harley Quinn but I'm open another Jinx style crazy character
Scene girl of my youth
girl dinner
She protecc she atacc and most importantly she SUCC
I think this girl and Jinx should be friends, they’ll destroy the world together
Foot yumy 🤤
"Feeding Frenzy"?! Call that my solo queue games
Wait a minute. Is Nimona a major inspiration on Briar?
The ping noises got me tbh.
Ah yes nice of you to OFFICIALLY release it XD
oh boy oh boy oh boy
I thought she would act less feral, like vladimir or something, but I like this more
Feet
Me every time i get hungry
i thought she was another demacian prisoner but that's noxus armor on the jailers
ыааа резняяяя
Will it be wild rift too
So she has some form of sentience (like Jinx ig), but when see goes berserk it;s like a mental blackout
Okey she is cool and creepy. But still, It gives me jinx vibes.
I can fix her!
eve buff incoming
The fact that she didn't kill her "friend" was so wholesome
Briar, Jinx and Zoe would get along together very well
Is this a new champion?
POV: Your over clingy girlfriend be like
But that's just nimona like omg so obvious
Is that what happens to jinx after arcane?
People that like BRIAR!! 😁😁 👇
Honestly she is very similar to Jinx, which is very interesting but not what I expected
"We cannot show gore because chinese daddy gets angry"
Nimona?🫂
Ugh...and I thought Jinx is the only one who was Crazy
Spoopy.  Edit: She seems like a nice person.
No feet this time Riot?
ฮาเคน 2 รออยู่ครับ ไม่มีไฟเล่นเกม เติมไฟ ให้ผมด้วย อาเคน2 ด้วยครับ
YOYOYOYOYO
Shalltear Bloodfallen from Overlord anime vibe 😂😂
Update như concac vậy
Reminds me a lot of Tai Lungs prison escape lol
For some reasons, she reminds me of nimona from nimona movie
she T H I C C 🙏 GOD BLESS
I can see the nimona influence
eae
Put an epilepsy warning in either the title or the start of the video.
Love this sound lmao 00:59
At least she has shoes in this one
Seems extremely Nimona inspired, which is GOOD
WAIT BUT THAT IS THE VOICE OF POWDER
Finally, The Opium Girl
Sus
I don't understand the PG3 Cartoon Network style of exaggerated animation seemingly catered towards young children. Her story is dark, this animation is contradicting...
Noxian Arcane Jinx
Ngl, looks like the design team watched Nimona once and said lets redo Jinx but exactly like that
I can fix her
Riot just watched Nimona's trailer didn't they ?
When Jinx goes melee
BRO they did not hold back with this XD. Brutal
breedeable
I really love the wisthles at the end
Them noxians have some mad prisoners like tf soon even a sol gonna be in there
Didn't expect her to be this crazy but its okay
So much helmet bros...........
Jinx 2.0…
so just jinx again but as a vampire?
First
Briar bloodfallen
Sooooooooo, jinx but vampire????
She makes me think of Gorillaz, and that's a compliment. Excited for her😍❤️
Ayoooo
Kungfu panda?
The pings 💀
I love her (not in that way) but I'm not going to play her. I'm a adc main. Who is the voice actress?
what are thooooooose
Finally, a decent animation 🎉
After arcane, blood lust Jinx went to Noxian jail?
its this nimona?
A Noxus Vampire Jinx? Yeah i can dig that. I mean ofc i wish that she was darker when she goes crazy with more voice,personality and physical changes,but at least personality wise she seems to be a Noxus Jinx,and who doesn’t love Jinx’ personality?
I was expecting her to have a different voice, but she sorta sounds like Jinx.
Use this comment like dislike
League of Legends's Nimona. 😊
The Jinx vibes she has fit her  very well
What a boring design. Instead of being creepy she's just Jinx 2. What a dissapointment.
I dont like her voice but shes pretty cool
feet? 😢
BRO SHE REMINDS ME OF NIMONA
Ngl that was fun! 🤪👍 Now give her some fitting lore PLEASE!?
Love her design!
what a dayum
She looks very fish
I tought she was silent-type haunt
Yeah this is just another really bad intemp to get lolis into the game sad league is becoming genshin impact at this point even have a gocha system. Let me guess shes also like 10000 years old but looks like a child wtf riot freaking pedos.
😍🍄🍄🍄🍄🍄😘
New Jinx just dropped
i see they putting the arcane team to work on cinematics now
they keep the feet kinda
So happy to see Not Safe For Work Nimona in this game XD
Spider Punk type beat
briar should've been all feral sounds from someone who went crazy after years of being locked up without nothing to eat but I must admit this trailer really got me hype lol
I JUST LOVE IT
The best league cinematic for jinx 2, dont get me wrong i like her, but fellas it really is jinx down to the pronunciation of words hahahaha, but spectacular
The fe-
Such ugly animation as usual Just release gameplay
Why is this giving me Nimona vibes ?
Reminds me of hobie's animation style from the latest spiderverse movie
Why is jinx a vampire now
really cool animation style
shes so cute i love her
Looks cool aside from the voice imo
How to make a not r-rated massacre
same jinx
She's kinda cute and pretty scary at the same time.
She look like kid , she can't hurt you That one kid
Shes so cute
im excited to act unhinged as i play her :D
Nimona
Nimona vibes
The Animation style of her gives me Gorillaz vibes :D
She is really cool but I was expecting something more "horror like" and not... Jinx 2.0 Because she lowkey sounds like Jinx, acts like Jinx, is "crazy" like Jinx etc.. Every horror aspects have been "nerfed" or censored.
wilt rifte ne zaman gelirrr
She's a lot different then I thought she would be but still very interesting
I mean the animation is cool but I dont know if it makes her any different from jinx
Nimona Vibes
Looks and acts like a nimona
Nimona?
Sheesh
Jinx + Briar = Chaos
smash
She reminds me Nimona <3
animasyon cok iyi
This makes me cringe
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
HER TRAILER GIVES SUCH NIMONA VIBES I LOVE IT
Gives off Jynx vibes.
briar about to suffocate me with these hips help
I lover her
have. my. babies
ah yes, grape juice blood
SHES HEREEEE
“She’s been fed” Oh so they’re just gonna release her busted like that ok
we're here
Woa, that's so nice that she didn't kill him at the end
Woah
its just jinx but shes a cannibal
I can’t wait kill her in game.
Sad how all the leaks killed the hype for me
Mimona ?  Thats so lazy :/
Glad to see Jinx moved away from all of Piltover/Zaun's drama
Nimona joins league of legends
nimona vibes
Jinx?
Cool! Very cool!
oha lan
no epileptics warning?
she’s amazing
WOAW
Looks so different than I thought she would be
New champ?
Fun
Primeiro
