GOD!!!! Bobby Brown is so gorgeous!!
I like that the bloopers are cinematic, like i watch the movie in a diff vers.
The Head - bumping bit was funny
0:30 Canon
I love Millie😍❤️
Miss Brown appears to be full of energy and fun- also a real ham!
1:02 😆😆🤣
Just another beautiful reminder that even actors are human
😂😂😂😂
The best!
1:59 this is cute
helena's laugh 😭😭😭😭
Somebody needs to clip 0:00 through 0:14 to Olivia Rodrigo
Who else thinks that Henry and Sam look alike 🧐👀
Will there be a 3rd film
I know! Grown up babyfight
Dear Blakc people, you are not even indigenous to Haiti and Jamaica never mind the British Isles.
is someone here from 2024?
You can tell that last gag was staged coz how tf did nobody notice she was wearing her glasses?😂
Oh now i get who that principal remined me of thats aunt petunia and Helena bonham carter was bellatrix lestrange 😂
1:06 her laugh❤ 2:13
Louis is so cute me and my sis are crushing on him
Millie just doing the floss😂😂😂
All I know that the chemistry between Elona and Tewkesbury is mind blowingly amazing. Want more of them and looking forward to a Elona Homes 3.
Conclusion: this movie made me like Louis partridge more than I already did also why is nobody talking about 0:11
Where is michael, dustin and lucas?
I like the first blooper when he bangs his head 😆
The Helena bloopers are always the best * look at the boom * 😂😂 I love her 😂
hi eleven
0:01 The tension was building up and then– ouch lmao
louis and Millie dancing at 0:33 is the cutest thing ever
cutie huhu
There was no Black's in England during this time. The Black's came to England in 1948 via Zionist ship Windrush. I can't enjoy the movie if you don't make it realistic.
imagine having finnick odair and superman as your brothers bellatrix as your mother and eleven as your sister
“And the exen- ThE WhAt”
Based Helena Bonham-Carter. <3
😍🤩🥰🥲
I watched it yesterday 🥰. It’s crazy that this movie is 2 years old already, cause I am Millies age and I was 15 turning 16 when it came out and now I am 18 🥲🥺❤️
I find it interesting that, in this movie, the clapper lists this film as "Ferndell", and in Enola Holmes 2 is says, "Matchsticks". Huh.
I live under a rock.    I just found out who Lilly Bobby Brown was a couple days ago.   Then I see this pop up in my suggestions, this girl "Enola Holmes" sure looks like Millie Bobby Brown.
Love this and their relationships! I heard a man's voice say 'Sophia' and I wonder who he was calling, that's my name also :) Missed Mycroft in the second movie
The chorus of " oH Louis" 's in the beginning has me wheezing 🤣🤣
I was waiting for a “Tis I” 😂
Millie Bobby brown is amazing
In the beginning he hit his head
They're all so cute! Poor Louis, he hit his head 😂
floss queen is back
I love that movie
The montage of Millie flossing was the best part fs
0:12 nawr he's so cute :(
The trio of Holmes are hilarious
On strange things she proved a charismatic actress as Eloma.she also is a beautiful.and charming girl
🤣👏
Not Millie just acting like a child on set but when cameras on she’s all serious
2:26 is such a savage move😵
MILLIE BROWN I LOVE U BABE!! 😉
They would laugh in british
Millie is literally everyone's best friend.
when he hit his head on the window i laughed so hard and i replayed it now my throat hurts
When she did the fornite dance I closed the video
"Rawr"⚰️⚰️🙃❤️😂😺
Okay, Mycroft is a serious, no-nonsense character so seeing him laugh, he just looks precious.
you can take sam claflin out of england but not england out of sam claflin!
❤I just love Inola
Great actress, Milly Bobby Brown.
Hard to believe she was 16 in this, time flys. I would've sworn this show was new😂
glad it has a second season yeyyyu!
0:29
just lovely
I really wish you guys to make a movie on "The Naughtiest Girl in the School ", Enid Blyton. It would simply be marvelous
Best movie ever!
ACEPET JESUS CHRIST IN YOUR LIFE  TIME IS RUNNING OUT JESUS IS COMING SOON. REPENT OF ALL YOUR SINS. JESUS LOVES YOU SO MUCH! God bless yall❤
HENRY YOU ARE THE LOVE OF MY LIFE, NEED MORE MOMENTS LIKE THIS IN THE SECONDS MOVIE!
0:30 1:59
Helena and the baby melted my heart!
Love Mills❤❤
The way she flossed in  0:35 lol
“GO” was amazing
This looks so fun!
Legend Say "Its Eleven"    But its its milli
Not me watching this while I (im)patiently wait for Enola Holmes 2 to be released on Netflix ;)
oooooh, there was a _sound_ from that first one, I hope he's okay
millie’s always the one to break character😭
0:28

Why is no one talking about 2:03... IT'S SO ADORABLE HOW HE WENT "MY CHIN"
"I mean I could do it abnormally fast"

Millie is an absolute social butterfly.

WE NEED THE SECOND MOVIE
I swear me and Millie are so alike 😂
01:23 Petunia!!!!!
0:23 😍
0:34 she did what..?
*Damn she really is living the best life. Wish I could just have an ounce of her positive energy. Maybe then things could improve for me too. Gotta turn off my negative brain so I can start enjoying life. But I fear that's only a case Sherloc (or Enola) Holmes can solve.* 🤔🧐
Oh I knew the actress for Enola looked familiar! Never would have guess it was Millie Bobby Brown
The way Louis hit his head lmao-
i feel like sam and millie have like the same energy level lmao
0:23 That smile 🕊
This is everything
2:10 ihdSGGU this evil man turns out to be silly n goofy✨

i love how the comment section is just full of "i love how"s and "how is no one talking about"s
The way she still flosses makes me cringe 😬
henry is so adorable i cant even-
I'm still laughing at when Louis hit his head on the window😂🤣😂

Luuuuuuuuul
MILLIE HAHAHHSS

I was waiting for the first blooper to end in so many ways. I was not expecting it to be Louis hitting his head.     I screamed
0:33
God she's gorgeous
I'm wearing my glasses!!
I don't know why I'm alway cracking up to see Burn laugh. Maybe it's his face or his characters or I don't know what :D
he said sukriya its a hindi word means thanks in english
Millie is literally so chill.
Helena with the baby is just so cute
Why isnt anyone talking about millie and louis dancing at 0:33
Millie Bobby Brown is the best actress ever.
1:59 i just cant Helena is so cute
The silent cereal yearly fail because soil geometrically murder concerning a wacky comic. statuesque, ossified shorts
She is an absolutely gorgeous beautiful young woman!

I watched this before I watched Stranger Things and I didn't even recognise millie 😂
2.25

There are so many actors from Harry Potter in this movie
Aww what a wholesome video                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   So now that I have your attention Netflix, when is the beloved sequel that we all need of Enola, going to begin filming? And when is Season 4 of Stranger Things coming out? And when will All The Wrong Questions begin filming as well? We the people need answers.
1:05 The what?

Not realistic at all, a woman from africa teach jiu jitsu, No, not in victorian England. Head police chief from india 😂 Not in victorian time, not even in 20th century. Diversity tries in wrong period of time lol
I think the reason why her mum left was so bellatrix could become death eater!

Enola fighting microsoft at the back of the scene
The series was great.
1:59 Helena Bonham Carter at this part 🥺🥺
I only came because Of Helena Bonham Carter
THIS THUMBNAIL MAKES HER LOOK LIKE WINONA RIGHT
Loved it!! I loved the movie and I loved the bloopers!!!
Ok but no one’s talking about how Enola Holmes could move to United States and have children and in the end Eleven is her greatgreatgrandchild
Helena ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I luv Millie so much and I loved watching her in Stranger Things and now this!  She is so talented and growing so fast!
World: *ends* Millie bobby brown: *floss*
“I can do that abnormally fast! It’s quite cool 😏” - Millie   I love her 😂

تكفون الفلم كملللل
😂😂
I don't know what the movie is about but my parents won't let me see it on Netflix because it says it's for people over 13 (age)
★WHH BISH THEY SO CUTE★
Millie: *flosses quickly*  “I mean I can do it ✨ABnOrMalY✨ fast!”
Why is no one taking about how cute it was the way Louis dipped Millie at 0:32
THIS IS SO FUNNY FOR WHAT

Omg Millie is so sweet 🤗🥺 I wish I was close with her
I love how elonas mum is dracos mum from harry PoTtAh
Everybody talk about how beauty Louis is but is no one gonna talk about how stunning Henry cavil is
Do you see that the rector is the actress of Harry Potter petunia?
Netflix, thank you for blessing us with this movie I'll take seven more please
Her name should be Elona like reference to Stranger Things so it's "El"ona
Millie just be flossing
I love how there's this really intense scene and then *bonk*
BHAHAHAHA THE WAY HE HIT HIS HEAD ON THE WINDOW I CANT-
Sherlock homes in the movie my aunt used to babysit him
0:29 I love how they are literally siblings irl! Henry is the older brother just patiently watching them lmfao
Just how many harry potter characters were here?
I never noticed before now that after he hits head head you can hear people go “aw Lou, Awww Loui”
Nobody: Literally nobody: Millie: *randomly showing off her flossing skills.
"I don't want to leave you Enola"  Enola: "GO" *bangs his head  0:00
The early birthday steadily change because november retrospectively soothe per a tasteful driver. chivalrous, illustrious porch
1:04 I don't know him but I love him
Wait did her or her stunt double do the karate
"05:27" The only working one is *𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐳.𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐞*
"02:91" 😂 Ok that is the best: *GETFANZ.PR0* 📌 disregard others they're BS
"04:99" 😂 Why waste your time when only *♥𝗚𝗘𝗧𝗙𝗔𝗡𝗭.𝗣𝗥𝗢* 📌 does it for everybody
"05:10" Why don't people use: *𝗚𝗲𝘁𝗳𝗮𝗻𝘇.𝗽𝗿𝗼* 📌 instead of wasting their time here
This was totally meant to be a series instead of a movie!
0:11 don't mind me
The ending of Enola is elementary at best. I mean seriously does this poor excuse of a film need explanation, I don’t know about you but I didn’t get that investigative  atmosphere from the film
WHY IS EVERYONE SO ADORABLE
I'm literally evaporating because of the things millie does GOODBYE A WIDOW JUST DANCING LIKE THAT BYE
It’s Millie flossing for me😂😂
Dr Strange, Ironmman, now Superman is sherlock

My fave bit is when Sherlock ( I don’t actually know the actors name, sorry ) says “ what “
The way Louis grab Millie 🥰
The exotic thrill cytomorphologically branch because ash scilly remain above a enormous flag. easy,  foamy balinese
Holt sh*t, who knew Bellatrix and Eleven will be in this movie? lol

0:32 Their little dance 😊

hilarious! loved this film :)
Is it just me but why every time I see Helena I thin of Bellatrix ??!!!
I think we all had a mandela effect thinking this was a series until we were already watching it
THE  RIPPER  2020  NETFLIX MASSIVE  BLOOPER.  in the new  "THE RIPPER"  series on netflix,  episode one,  a police officer is being interviewed live in the street at the 07:36 Mark, no one noticed peter sutcliffe "The Yorkshire Ripper", drive past in his "Dark Brown Rover P6"  taunting the police at exactly  07:55,  no one has ever noticed this, not even the police,  that is, until i did. G.S. Matuszczyk. my alias.
6 feet.
I would love to see another one where she "finds" herself and solves more cases and then she'll meet tewksbury again and they fall in love. (because I think the ending was so good bc she did as she should and wanted but the chemistry was there between her and tewksbury so I think there should be a part two)
I love Millie she is great!!!
I'm here for that "the what??" of Henry Cavill :))
me mori de la risa cuando se golpeo la cabeza JAJAJA
“I forgot I was wearing my glasses” that’s something I would do lol
0:31 idk why but i like this one the most😂😂😂😂
0:22 his superman hair is falling down💀
millie has always owned the ‘floss’ ;)
0:33 omg!!!! I ship Louis and Millie so much!
2:36. What did she say?
Great characters, fun premise, bland movie and just a bit to overwhelming with the obvious symbolisms. I may not be the target audience for this, but sure places representation in the right direction.
The hard-to-find result osmotically muddle because dew annually queue excluding a apathetic engineer. sticky, truculent keyboarding
Eleven
im wach today itd good
why does she looks like 30 when she’s literally....... 16? 😳
Why have i watched this without watching the movie-

Floss in 2020 really?
Die Frau mit dem Auto erinnert mich an Petunua
too good the movie
I was recently just watching the feel-good movie,” Big,” with Tom Hanks. It’s one of my go- to movies when I’m feeling kinda blue.Anyways, I realized how much Milli- Bobby looks like Elizabeth Perkins.👍😁
wach this in rewind 1:01
My mother named me Xerxes, which spelled backwards is SexRex.
I didn't even realize it was Millie
Jajaja
In stranger things she try's to focus man i dont see any focus here
I have a seriously unhealthy obsession with this movie. Right now ive watched it at the very least 11 times
There flossing And I love how Millie was saying that she can do it really fast
Bellatrix- the mom Madam Maxine- The grandmother Aunt Petunia- The leader of the school
aaaaaaaaaaaaa double chin 1:54
helena is amazing
helena coughing was my fav dnhudihbcidu
Ok but why does being in a movie look so fun

HAHAH the crew after Louis hit his head is like “ Oh LoUiSe”
The ahead siberian independently trap because lotion naturalistically form qua a profuse bolt. soft, icy pediatrician
Sam is like a cool and fun older brother to Millie. While Henry is the serious one,more like an Uncle. 😂
How much make up did Enola's mother need to cover her death-eater tattoo?
Burn: My Cheeeeeen
1:22, 0:15,  0:28  i still don't get how millie manages to look beautiful at 1:54

I
HAHAHAHA I LOVE THIS, REALLY.
a Enola homes é muito engraçada 😄😄😄
Millie bobby braunw
What a dumpster fire of a movie! I pity anyone who fell for this hot mess of hackneyed clichés and open insults to the intelligence of the audience. READ the books to see what you missed!
Helenas laugh is SO FUNNY DISNSKSNSKNS
stranger things : Don't forget me🙃💔
*cool*  _fun_  -sleep-
WE NEED A SECOND MOVIEEEE
Plsss make a second Enola because it was so cool and amazing watching it
Why isnt anyone talking about the fact that there were three Harry Potter characters? Bellatrix, Aunt Petunia and Madam Maxine.
0:11 poor louis but it was funny 😂
PETITION FOR ENOLA HOMES TO BECOME A SERIES AND SHE SOLVES MORE MYSTERIES WITH VIASHDAHKJDEHAKLDA MARQUEE OF BASILWEATHER

Yes queen
I wasn’t ready for this to end
Nice movie but the adults or... men of the era let a teen girl without any adult relative run around in town and rent rooms??? Wow...
0:33 omg if that isn't in the next movie I swear to god-
Did no one else lose their shit when Millie's hat flew off during the train scene?
I love this movie
Xddd
I love how Millie didn’t have to force a American accent for this movie!!!!
0:11 Ouch this hurts so bad
My best moment it's with Fiona Shaw 😂
How do we laugh?  ✨ha ha ha ha✨
millie: runs with louis also millie: "oh! I forgot im wearing my glasses!*
She just blew me away in this movie
LMFAOAOAOAOAOAOAO
Oh this is just like the classic 90s or 80s ( I don't know so please do  hate :( )
The first one was real PAIN.
They totally should have left the "nice hat" in.
Am I the only one who thinks Henry and Sam look a lot similar?
BEST BLOOPERS EVER! Millie makes every movie and video a thousand times better! I love the movie and the cast!
I’m sorry but, how cute is Helena with the baby at 2:00
I swear in any bloopers / extra video that millie is in she flosses
less of her, more of the cute men please.
Enola holmes is one of my favorite movies
I found this so funny 0:30
01:01 "...ehhhh the what?" xD
CRAP xdddd
Fiona Shaw 😂😅
Millie: epicly flosses*
LOS AMO JAKSJSJJA

Aunt petunia and Bellatrix Lestrange together 😀
0:12 im sorry but I  can't stop laughing 🤣
I wish enola holmes would become series
Enola reminds me of Hetty Feather
why are none of the crew and actors not wearing masks i don't want millie and louis getting cover THEY ARE THE PERFECT SHIP WHYYYYYYY
Nobody is gonna talk about the Sam Claffin and Millie's mini fight? HAHA
okay, but that baby can technically say that she played Enola Holmes... I mean, it WAS tiny Enola, after all
I just want part 2 to come pizzazz Netflix
I just want part 2 to come pizzazz Netflix
idk why henry still not a suitable as sherlock cause for me benedict always the best sherlock even better than robert downy jr
1:23 That would have literally been me at the moment 😂
Oh my god... 11 got old...
At least they tried...
*Well I can do it abnormally, like just, abnormally.*
The way Millie does the floss😂😂😂
i cringed so hard when she did the floss
1:13 Mill: "I don't want this as a flower you absolute moron!" Louis: *chuckles*
22 new details that you might have missed in the movie: https://youtu.be/ZEQNg9BnTYQ
Has anybody noticed that the violent man in this doesn't say any lines apart from           'england'
oh mr. bellatrix i see u
1:11 the way he’s looking at her here ❤️❤️
No hablen inglish ahrre soy latina Bonita estupidez ahrre so re argentina
He’s my best friend’s brother’s best friend
From a stranger things kid to a detective teen
2:36
louis bumping his head was all i needed. AHAHAHAHHAHA
Hello!! A subscriber gave me a gift) netflix subscription (90 days) It can be activated an infinite number of times !! I'll leave her here for exactly 7 days !! link we.tl/t-3av7TZyx6X
0:04 me taking a heavy shit
I’m still shook that Mycroft also plays FINNICK FREAKING ODAIR
Helena with that baby is the cutest thing ever!! Oh my word, I was melting with the cuteness overload! I love her so much.
Am I the only one that thinks Mycroft (Sam Claffin) looks like Freddie Mercury ???
plot twist: enola is voldemorts daughter
I wish I was a actor or even as good as a actor as her like i have so many questions
im stupid its aunt putina and bellatrix larstrange
The prince look like v I'm so beautiful :3 I wish I'm there without will "::333
Floss em pleno 2020 millie? Kskkd
video beautiful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GrF-FWd6Vw&t=29s
"I can do it abnormally fast"       "iT's QuITe CoOL"
Who knew eleven was sherlocks sister  You’ll get this if you watched stranger things
this movie is soooooo good
2 hours I'll never get back what a Croc of shit. If your under 20 and a girl you will probably love this but anyone else should stay clear. Sherlock deserves better than this crap
My grade is a generous 6/10. The technical details and the performance of MBB are fantastic, but they hide a fragile script that clings to the breaking of the fourth wall to use the charisma of the actress and establish a certain connection with the viewer. With the feminist theme and the rise of the suffragette movement in mind, perceive a reductionist tone, weakening the male figure excessively, which conveys a repetitive feeling (now you call me macho, np). The costume was impeccable, highlighting a concern with the colors and the context of each take. In general it is a well-produced film, but it comes in the current erroneous aspect of navigating universes of classic characters for commercial purposes only, reflecting the lack of creativity in the 21st century. If you disagree, look up the meaning of the word opinion in the dictionary ........ Google.
And on Egybest
they really started off with louis accidentally hitting his head above the window, i'm done 😂
I love how Sam Claflin and Mycroft are polar opposites 😂😂
The only thing I love more than the movie is Millie being able to act her age
Awwwwww Helena and the baby was too cute🥺
😊😊😊😊
0:11HAHAHAHA
"4:30"   oh my gosh thank you I've been really thinking about my life         he’s the only one getting me free money *pyptolmon. xyz*    අනුගාමිකයන් ඇති කර ගැනීමට හොඳ ක්‍රමයක
Holy shit she looks A LOT like Natalie Portman😱😱 absolutely gorgeous❤️
2:25 the fact that she actually flipped him over (or maybe i’m just blind and that was a stunt double)
2:10 That doesn't much sound like the "fookin legend of gin alley." Which is good, because he was freaking terrifying in GoT.
Aaaa I love this movieeeee my bff showed me it last night and now I swear I have seen it like 5 times soon to be 6 XD
they’re so talented I cry I cry
this has so much potential to be a series
How is called the song at the beginning??
1:06 isnt that the  women playing ballatrrix in hp
I love how millie talks alot <33
She is really beautiful with long hair
Oh my God when you realize that there r two harry potter characters

Aaaw millie and henry’s chemistry is amazing!
It's obvious they enjoyed themselves a great deal on set. It's lovely, the atmosphere seems really fun and friendly between all of the actors
0:33  that is such a precious second 🥺 (The enola, Tewkesbury scene, behind the train I mean)
They should’ve kept the “nice hat” in the movie
Just me who’s like ‘why is the whole Harry Potter cast in this’ jk not the whole cast but like
Did Millie really do all those martial art scenes???
who came for louis
okay but helena with that baby was just adorable
I just noticed how awkward it is to record a movie
So no one gonna talk about how Louis and Millie were dancing and he dipped her? So cute
I love the beginning when he hits his head lol
https://youtu.be/ecmxyPTDjlU
https://youtu.be/ecmxyPTDjlU
Blooper reel, aka, Millie Bobby Brown makes faces.
Film about mother-Chrysanthemum. She was amazing !
Olny on netflix  Egybest: we will see😏
there is three harry potter cast and 1 beauty and the beast 2017 cast bellatrix (the holmes mother), petunia (ms harrison), madame maxime (the dowager), Agatha in beauty and the beast  (tewksbury's mother)
Omg the first one breaks my heart🤣🤣 they were so serious until Louis bumps his head🤣🤣🤣👁️👄👁️
the way her hat fell off xD  0:52
1:10  Louis knows how to give a look!
finnick looks so different here🤔
I really love this girl already
I love that when henry hair was in the way😍😂😂
Bloopers ft. Millie's dancing compilation 😆
This is so cool!
Oh shit hahahhaa
Probably the Stranger things actors got too old for the series so Here it s Enola holmes
Mille: I can do it abnormally fast it's quite cool.    For some reason that makes me laugh
These were one of the best 2 minutes and 58 seconds I've ever seen
It's really great when the actor who palys  Enola's partner/friend/love interest is the same age as her or is a teenager himself. Usually they will pick actor that is older by more than 5 years than the female actress.
I think Louis will look so good in Hogwarts uniform.
THIS IS A MUST WATCH, EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE.
*I didn’t know I could feel this happy in the span of just 3 minutes...*
Brazil
1:54 that was AMERICAN millie popping out
Love the movie strangerthings
Is it just me or is enola’s mother’s actor, the actor of bella lestrange from harry potter? Idk if her name’s bella but she’s one of the lestranges
i wish fortnite dances never existed
I want a part 2 for their love story and enola’s mums strategy
So cute Bellatrix Lestrange found her way...
louis bumped his head lol
I really want enola homles to become a series ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bad movie waste of time.... bad casting ... henry cavill really not expressive but yea he's handsome ... you know ... but good job for millie and louis !
will have Enola Homes 2 ?
2:34 lol
Louis' head...😭
Mycroft looks like freddie mercury
the crazy thing is is that i JUST watched this last night lolll the answers to my questions have arrived!!
0:33 the cutest scene
mycroft holmes in the movie: "YOU ARE MY WARD!" mycroft holmes in bloopers: 0:30
i clicked on this thinking it was on the trailer and i was like is she serious about doing that floss dance or what
the flying hat from millie’s head will always be hilarious like yEEt💨💨💨
I was laughing with Helena
2:03  Millie: (inhuman warrior screaming) Crew: "Stop!" _(everyone immediately halts and stares)_
Please please please make a sequel one 🙏🙏🙏
Louis Partridge (you're welcome):  0:00 0:17 0:33 0:37 0:51 1:10 2:34
awww millie is so funny , i love her
Millie jumps off a train, then starts to floss...
lol homophobic 🤣
God love this movie
I just realised the teacher and the mother are both from Harry Potter lmao
I love how Bellatrix Lestrange and Petunia Dursley are here😂
Helena😍🥺
Millie Bobbie brown is very happy person she just make good vibe
They should've turned this into a series millie would've smashed it.
Louis with long hair was so beautiful I was actually mad when they cut it 😂
0:30 i love how they just fight like that like real siblings would fight.
I have not watched this show yet. Do they play the loud music all through the scenes?
omg PLEASE DO THIS FOR RATCHED
MILLIE PLEASE STOP WITH THE FLOSSING
I really hope we get a Sherlock film with Cavill.
Enola holmes is my ultimately favourite film ever😍😁😊
Ok so like am I the only one who thinks that Mycroft Holmes looks like rami malek as Freddie Mercury?
Really loved this movie so much!
0:30 😂😂😂😂😂
Everything about this movie was just awesome. The cast (especially Millie), the plot, the production value, the way it was made. Awesome job LOVED this movie 👏👏👏
Any movie with Helena Bonham Carter never fails to disappoint

"It's AN honour" ... Wait What...
Just want to say how so freaking bad this movie is, not only you choose this bad weird "actress" but she won't stop talking to the camera, I don't care if you think that was a good idea, it did not work. Put this on "miserable failure" pile of Netflix Originals, cuz that's what you have the most of.
I love Aunty Petunia!!!
0:39 louis tho
Honestly this is one of my favorite movie
This is really funny
WHY is nobody talking about how Louis dipped Millie @ 0:32
I love the cat fights, the floss, the face stretches, this is 𝑖𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒
YO SUPERMANS A FUCKIN BEAST 😭😭
MOREEEEE PLEASE
I can do it abnormally fast. It’s quite cooool. (In British accent) -Millie Bobby Brown
She’s so cute honestly she’s had an amazing future ahead of her  and she’s very mature for her age tbh
Ya
lmao Millie just casually flossing on set like did on st baha then there's her and sam flapping their arms why is that so funny ahh
see Millie just always seems like someone who is trying to act above her actual age while really annoying everyone around her
why have i only noticed Henry has a bum nose till now :/
2:13 bellatrix is not okay
so good
Millie doing the floss is the cutest thing I have ever seen 😭😭
This entire abortion is a blooper.
00:13 that thud tho XD
No one : Me : Waiting for the Enola Holmes 2 👁️👄👁️
They couldn’t have chosen a better person to play enola holmes
Why is she so adorable. ............... love you Enola muah muah. .. <3
One of my new favorite moviesss ❤️❤️
Gw kesini krn debri sumule :v
blippi
Who else saw this before it got released <3
I’m so glad I watched the movie and this bloopers!
I loved this soooo muchhh ❤️
i m gonna watch this movie!!!!!!!
I love millieee
I am in just Love with Millie Bobby Brown <3
Love this accent
Definitely need more of Enola Holmes but also Ms Brown was spectacular in this her acting has so many subtleties truly impressed. Remember when the boy (literally what was his name? too long) snuck into the finishing school and he turned away and every time she cries just what great chops this girl has. Great movie, also loved that one tear the boy (again idk) gave when asking when parting from enola at the gate just !
how come hollywood hire no-talent stick figures and whores who can't do shit while millie bobby brown is the ultimate definition of charisma?
0:35 Look, even the widow had style.
2:34 ME AF ON STAGE
It seems it's impossible to be around  Millie Bobby brown and be sad! she is the cure for depression
Microsoft and Sony.
0:30-0:31 ah yes and here we see the entire movie in a nutshell   (I do love this movie tho)
Amazing  Watch reels and short videos here: @ebdg
SEQUEL PLEASE!!
This man actually knocked out 4 people in a bar fight https://youtu.be/qTYB2oSuef0 man really got a care package
MILLIE FLOSSING HAD ME DYING
I watched the first clip like 20 times
"I mean I can do it abnormally fast. It's quite cool."
Millie, Henry and Sam as siblings issayes for me.
I have only one thing to say: where the deleted scenes and bloopers for The Old Guard???
I am very excited to see this movie but I can not watch it cuz I don't have a account in it cuz my parents don't allow me to watch Netflix I wish someone can share account password and I'd  But I know no one will 😔😔
Bro... the first got me dying 😂
Burn Gorman going from villain to super friendly at 02:08
I loved I just watched yesterday ✨❤️✨
this should be renamed netflix feminist club.... and stop looking at the camera as if looking for validation.
0:50 is that "sukhriya" ( hindi word)
00:30 so that’s how they fight 😂
0:33 😍💖🤭 2:12 🤣🤣🤣
Please make another enola holmes film
Well I'm doing a research based on spirituality n it's benefits https://forms.gle/mfhBF43SUAQCJXZK8  Can u plz fill it up n help me investigate it... I'm looking for various people from various groups' opinions Lol
When people from Stranger things, The Witcher, Harry Potter, The Expanse and Killing Eve come together
Muito bom um dos melhores filmes que assisti este ano.
I want more Millie and Louie Behind the scene please
SO CUTEEE!!!!!
Thoroughly enjoyed this film
Henry @ 0:22 is making me question my sexuality
Idk why people are trolling and bashing Cavill for the role of Sherlock! I mean this movie is about ENOLA HOLMES not Sherlock himself. It’s her season to shine show how much she can push the boundaries. If you guys want Sherlock to be the highlight plz go watch Sherlock Holmes by RDJ or Benedict Cumberbatch.
1:28 Petunia Dursley ewww🤮
Millie 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
oh no not Fortnite. please
Oh, to be the hairstylist on set and try to tame Henry's luscious locks....
Enola Holmes official bloopers(if you havent watched).
why did she sound american in one part
I really love how millie does the floss everwhere, like in her stranger things set❤😅
Did you notice the lady at 1:27  was petunia from Harry Potter and Helena was bellatrix!! Oh my goodness
I feel so mean for laughing at Louis when he hit his head on the window
i loved the movie
Gosh i have watched this movie 4 times this week ( in 4 days ) im obsessed .
I watch this in Netflix
Imagine being a young Millie Bobby Brown and getting to work with these fine studs.  My teen self would be in dreamland
I loved the movie but I wanted a better ending with those two
Millie and superman holmes 🤣🤣🤣🤦
I need Henry Cavill on a historical romance cover
0:23 imagine being so rich and famous that someone will fix a piece of your hair for you.
The talking into the camera in the movie ruined it... the blooper reel was better. 2/10 movie
This is really funny as I was finally starting to watch Stranger Things
Aunt Petunia AND Belatrix Lestrange? This is awesome!

@NetflixFilmClub, can you PLEASE adjust the volume of the 'thanks for watching' at the end, so it's the same level as the video?! It's so annoyingly LOUD! Happens on every video of yours!
can she not do the floss, it made me cringe.
Great film.
Omg two people from HP I-
I am really looking forward to the second movie!!!

another mary sue with feminism flag? how original nowadays..
Well if they ever have a Jane Bond it has to be Millie
A mind that disciplines itself is conforming to a pattern, restricting its own activity in order to be or become something. The whole of consciousness, the whole of what we call thought, is conflict- thought as the symbol, thought which is the response of memory.
0:30
0:33 LOUİS AND MİLLİEEEE OMGG
yoww this gown make me sad again
Anybody here from watching stranger things trailer ... oh just me ok ...
I can't stop laughing at Helena's karate chopping hahah

louis bumping his head in the middle of an emotionally charged scene has the same energy as millie slipping down the hill in stranger things and trying to save it lol
LMFAO WHEN LOUIS BUMPED HIS HEAD 💀💀💀💀💀

Great cast, but the movie wasn't great. I doubt I'll ever watch it a second time.
This cast is impeccable

Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.   God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.
I was surprised at how awesome this movie was. 😍
You've progressed well .... uhhj ... Byttj

This was a bad movie. Not as bad as I thought it would be but still pretty bad. it wasn't the passive-aggressive "Feminism" that got to me (That was predictable from the trailer) or even the mediocre performance from the lead actress. It was the actual "Drama"... Cliched... Generic just plain bland, kinda boring, and just so predictable.
Her flossing is great😂😂 she is so precious
Please can we have a sequel where the Viscount and Enola are a married couple being cute but solving crimes at the same time?
Enola holmes has eleven letters 👁️👄👁️
a great mix of actors here and a geat watch would recommend   witcher x harry potter x stranger things x peaky blinders

The most amazing thing is Mils is like Bruce Lee, as in his punches and kick, if she does the floss they have to use a high speed camera in order to slow her down because everyone thinks they are actually speeding them up. 😁

For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in our Lord Jesus Christ
I thought this movie was somehow related to Enola gay!
How did Superman/Geralt of Rivia, Finnick O'Dare, Bellatrix Lestrange, Eleven, and Piero de' Medici end up in one movie?     (I know they're actors, but still)
Henry cavill is such a pro
Who saw this early by playing the Enola Holmes detective game? 🙋🏼‍♀️
I’m sorry Louis, but you hitting your head on the window has me wheezing 😂

This is the Most Important post you will ever read;  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve all lied and we’ve all stolen, which makes us liars & thieves; And James 2 : 10 states that even breaking just one of these commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because The Creator is perfect in holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in justice, meaning not a single sin will go unpunished; and our penalty for sin is death & hell, which the Bible describes as Eternal fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  Fortunately God is also perfect in love, so 2000 years ago Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. Here, he lived a perfect & sinless life, only to take the punishment that we deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, & endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. On the third day, he conquered death & rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of Gods judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace; except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..  So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, & through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old ways. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, & the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9), and you will be saved.  The moment you do this, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds pleasure in sin, & also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; Nothing on this earth even close to compares to what awaits believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY.. meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU right this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you have surrendered to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. and as it is written(Hebrews 9 : 27);   ‘it is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’   All glory honor & praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
I would love a sequel or a series because I can't get enough of Millie as Enola!
BEST MOVIE EVERR

Is nobody talking about millie's american accent at 1:56
Gonna be honest i left my phone on autoplay in my pocket, Dunno how i got here or what this is
The story was all over the place but what a brilliant performance by Millie Bobby Brown. In love with he acting. Also not bad looking and will break hearts in years to come
it is actually a fun movie. but the feminazi and forced diversity in the 1800s are so ridiculous. but it's Netflix afterall, it's like a quota for them

It sounds like working on an American show during childhood has affected Mille's accent. You can hear it in the hard "R" sound at 1:53. Almost Australian
But im getting netflix in a few weeks

This movie is one of those British cinema gems: brilliantly written screenplay derived from a spirited book acted out by a stellar ensemble including stage veterans, established talents and exciting new blood, not to mention the costumes, the set, the cinematography, the editing, the music, etc. Highly enjoyable.
Cutest moment      Helana holding the baby 😩🥺🥺

Funny moment  Everyone try’s to hide their laughs because they don’t wanna ruin the scene     That’s my favorite 😂

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I have sinned against you and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have placed your faith in Jesus Christ and meant it with all of your heart, you are now a child of God and will go to heaven. Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism..
2 hours more of this please
Beautiful  https://instagram.com/tali_grande?igshid=ghipourtu185
Btw the flossing part was cringe
Deleted scenes please!
Lmao good to see even amazing actors and actresses have mess ups
Louis got quiet HAHAHA it's so cute, and millie is a great actress 🖤😣
Hehe, she's a great actor. When the hat flew off you can see her already thinking of how to improvise a line into the scene. Always the mark of a good actor to stay in character.

bellatrix, mrs dursley, and madame maxine what are you doing here?!
i’m gonna be that annoying person in the comment section asking people to follow her🥺🥺
Why am I disappointed that it was just a green screen and they didn’t actually jump of a moving train in the countryside? Like I genuinely thought they did!
The cast chemistry is off the charts 😍
I really liked that movie. I am excited to see what will come next. I mean, there are six books and soooo much potential to go into depth and develop more of the relationship with Enola with her brothers and Louis. Millie Bobby Brown, if you ever see this message, you are brilliant! Your charisma pierces the screen. You literally broke the 4th wall, and now you are breaking the internet so there you have it! Awesome job to all the cast. You have, since watching that movie, capture my heart and I wanna be your friend ;) Do you accept post-millennials in your club lol Take care!
1:55, WHY IS SHE TALKING IN AN AMERICAN ACCENT??
אני מאוהבת בההה❤

Jesus is coming when we least expect, pls repent. Beware of false prophets who will deceive many. get rid of what causes ur downfall, pray and read the Word. Jesus is the sole mediator. we're under God's wrath bc of sin. We're saved by grace not our works. God does not want us to perish in hell. dont be fooled by Satan, even he trembles before God. Im saying this bc i rlly luv u all, God bless❤️
I have never fallen in love this fast.
