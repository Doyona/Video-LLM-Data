I couldn't get out of our allotments the other day because of a dodgy padlock. After fiddling for a min I said to myself f this, you've seen geowizard! So I climbed a barbed wired metal gate for the 1st time in my life. Felt like a right accomplishment! Thanks GW!
This video deserves 1 million views, only 2K to go! I've just recently discovered GeoWizard's adventures, and I find it hilarious how he's scared of cows, sheep and farmers whilst having very little problems with climbing over the roof of a shopping centre of wading through dirty bushes and canals.
What kind of a fetish do people have who pick up their dogs‘ shit only to throw out the bag in nature? Is it that they just enjoy touching it through a plastic bag for some reason?
So been watching London and I'm hooked so I'm watching the backlog, even small places like this seems pretty hard
Fkn youtube deleting comments again man... its so infuriating! I'm 100% staying within guidlines!  It was about my dads advice of walking with a stick! Especially in water of unknown depth. And bravo for not letting life very you down and meeting it head on. Bit crappy of them to delete that.
Verity is a god damn saint
This is how you earn a million subs
2:05 just like my sx life 😂😂😂😂
is that a black country, new road reference
You may want to consider some sunglasses of safety glasses, Better than loosing an eye on a branch.
The old square used to do the best roast pork sandwiches.
Why do you Britishers bother with those trident spiky fences as you can just slide your foot between the pointy bits? Are they there to impale parachutists? Here in Belgium they have the omnipresent green steel wire Betafence of West Flanders fame with or without the razor wire side order.
BCNR MENTIONED
3:30 bro time stamped it as ''Leaving Warsaw'' LMAO legend
Laughing stock on the works stage?  Tell me a country that has it right then?
gg
AnWerrAmYowAGooin?ArDowFinkSo!
I know this an old vid now but I watch the series quite often as a black country lad myself, what about a canal only challenge where you go for the longest distance possible using only canals?
7:24 I love how Tom straightens his hair after knocking like waiting for a job interview 😆
why running though?
I don't think he could've stuck out more if he tried lmao, running in camo gear on a hot day in a city! Also yelling greetings to strangers, they all looked so confused why this lost soldier was addressing them. I think the only person that actually responded to him was the McDonalds worker, who is paid to do so lmao
I applaud your bravery 👏🏼
I think I might like you man, you are my level of dumb.
some of the best content on youtube
just wear black man.....
Eww 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮. why in the tunnel
I hope you dosed on bilharzia meds after that water course. I'd take 30 miles of sheep sh*t any day over that.
Oh I do miss a pint of bank's
19:19 "ye ye"
16:42 "Dead body? No."
I could see you on SAS or something like that, think you'd smash it!
can you do more no roads challenges? they r my favorite!
Your gf must think it’s strange what u do
Title should have been "💩A Bag Of Dogshit Just Landed On Me 💩"
My two worlds colliding, Black Country, New Road and silly geowizard wandering
Fascinating as an American  to discover that the UK is home to Mordor but not entirely surprising
Is that title a Black Country, New Road reference?
Brilliant ..as I come from the Black Country myself this series is what makes this extra special... your hard work has paid off for me... absolutely well done...New subscriber due to watching Storrror..😊
So the big question is the old squate shopping centre still there?
Tom you are just mad with these ideas. Very enjoyable to watch though.
Also - when you upload part 2 can you please go back to part one and give a link to the next part - yeah yeah I know I'm a right moaning bastard - but honestly it would get more hits  and I need to watch it instead of relying on youtube algo
Also - welcome to a whole new world of nappies and congrats x
Love the way you adjust your hair whilst waiting reponse from a door on a property you are trespassing on! 😂😂😂Alright mate?
This whole video fills my heart with joy cos I'm from Walsall (Pelsall) and we used to drink down by the polluted streams in Gosgote when we should have been at school.Infact I was drawn there and the railway became derelict while I was at school - I'd walk to school down the abandoned railway - and get greeted with 50% gamble - go up the bank into school or just carry on along the railway track like I'm in 'Stand By Me'.Guess what I often did.For me - best video on youtube and thats coming from a FilthyFrank fan 🤘Oh and Tom - walking down live railway lines is our British version of Jaywalking - I live in the lakes now,but used to jaywalk from Silverdale to Arnside at the age of 52 (well 47 then) - but the result is the same - girlfriend: "are you fucking mad?" - nah mate just free.(and a bit mad) 😂 I get quite emotional when you say 'we're leaving Walsall ay we kid' - makes we gonna go back and live in Clayhanger woods - I lived there for 6 months on an abandoned council dump - where I remember our dad dumping shit but it was overgrown by now - I even had a bath - I'd use it now,didnt use it then.£1000 dumping fine but all the shit they dumped I dragged into the woods and made a hut from - I had carseats as a sofa,a dining table,a firewood store . Got some Newcastle Brown - I did have an address,used my parents so during summer put some Black Sabbath on tape cassette on a ghetto blaster,kick back and   . Happy Days!
Watching a man in cammo jumping a fence and running onto the road: "Is that Raoul Moat, luv?"
If I was a security guy at that Primark area, I wouldve only found you suspicious because of the constant running. Just casually stroll when stuck somewhere, theyll probably gladly help you out a backdoor :D
"ain't we kid" gets me every time
SCHOOL BOY ERA WITH THE TRAINER'S BRO,🤔I HATE SOGGY SOCK'S.LOVE THE VIDEOS.ONELOVE, MANCHESTER, UK ✌️
I love that there are all of these really useful gates hanging around the place but they al turn out to be locked.
You need a machete, but then again, you would get arrested for having one in urban areas, so... maybe not. Pair of sheers maybe?
10:30 Maybe it's because I'm from Canada but if I saw a guy in the parking lot of a shopping center dressed in full camo grabbing stuff out of his truck I'd probably feel a little uneasy 😂
I like to imagine watching these that he is in some postapocalyptic world being chased by bounty hunters.
30:27 Anyone see the graffiti? how charming
Going on the roof of the Old Square and going thru the shopping centres was very unecerarry 🤔
This man has no embarrassment
You didn't show us what Monopoly stickers you got!!
You didn't show us what fucking Monopoly stickers you got!!!
"Knock knock knocking on Greggers door" although Slash is from Stoke, not Walsall 😅
It’s been a years time! Is the shopping mall a still operating?
It's basically Mirror's Age
i thought this urban version finally no need getting wet , just 5 mins later you wet again , i thought no more bramble fcker , then bramble got you finger.
It’s incredible those spiky fences are legal
Maybe geowizard was a rat in a previous life
I do enjoy your videos but it's ironic you mock the BC way of talking while talking with a pretty strong version yourself! 😆 (from Wolves originally but now live in that little village of Upper Tean you had the joy of visiting!)
This is amazing 😊 Reminds me of playing mirrors edge many years ago
Such a cool series!!
Believe in Jesus Christ, trust in Him for your eternal salvation and repent of your sins!
30:57 RODNEY THROBBER!!!!!!🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
10:30 Would be a little suspicious seeing someone changing into that on a parking lot, looks like you‘d take a semi-automatic next and going for it in the mall..
Haha i had an uncontrollable fit of giggles when you were in that brook 😂
24:11 for fcking god sake how did you just jump into the absolute sewer I know people in england have drank contaminated water but that was in the victorian era, and it wasnt even close to this amount of, literally, shit jesus
Black country, new road
has he ever confirmed or denied if this was a black country, new road reference?
Half expected you to bump into Martin Zero lol
você é bem desocupado né?
No way, I was just looking at that region on Google Maps yesterday. It did seem like a relic of the industrial revolution and I know Black Country is in the Midlands near Birmingham but wasn't sure this was it. Definitely a great place for an adventure like this one!
I love toms sense of humour and how he says things with such a straight face, for example the random "twat" or the junkie camp. 😂
I can’t find the lockdown one, did it get removed or something?
Black Country, New Road reference???????
Ever since this came out I've wondered if the title of this is a reference to the band called Black Country, New Road
I feel like some light parkour training would be beneficial. Especially if it was a competitive sport.  I love the idea of competitive trespassing lololol! 😂  Can't do that in the US, might get shot.  It's cool tho, I love it! 😀
can't believe you walked through sewage
In America if you switch into camo gear in a mall parking lot ... well don't.
The old square is still alive and kicking to this day with about 3 shops 😂 its been re done and everything
i'm surprises how he hasn't been arrested yet
Your videos have given me much more confidence in life and the bravery to improve myself, i now regularly trespass into old canal tunnels to get a closer glimpse of a used condom
3:08 I live just over the southern edge of the map. Yes, that village just north really is called Bell End. Adjacent to (I'm not making this up) Lickey End.
How about across West Midlands Safari Park in a straight line? >:]
Poor-kour
Absolutely fascinating, and also kind of depressing just how disused and vile the River Rea is. Did you ever get an answer to the orange goo? I understand as part of regeneration, Birmingham City Council are looking to open up the River Rea a bit more.
What a waste of time and life
Im buddy enjoying your adventures but it just shows what a absolute shit tip the the black country is 😡
Ya gotta love us black country lot ay ya 😅
When you’re crossing the road after the playing field🤣🤣 thumbs up a random bloke and instantly call him a twat after!😭 that’s absolutely class and being a brummie is the most typical thing we do
It’s so weird seeing a YouTuber of decent notoriety walking through where I live, it would be cool to see you around town. Gew on kidda.
Shite I missed this video Black Country arms is one of me locals 😂 how’d you find the terrible town of Walsall ?
Do you get spiders on your when you crawl through bushes
That lovely bit of nature at the 14 minute mark is Sheepwash Nature Reserve, it used to be and still is a toxic swamp. 😅
Haha love how he in camo and climbing thru stuff yeah that dont look strange 😂😂...  Quite addict to theys straight challenges just watched the Birmingham one yesterday
Found this channel by total luck, I had to laugh as I've lived in The Black Country all my life in many parts.  How you got across the roof of the shopping centre is beyond me, I got into The Service Entry part of Merry Hill one day when drunk by mistake & the security were on me like I was a master criminal!!!!
33:45 crazy to see what walsall looked like before the tesco. What year would this footage even be from?
As a Yam-yam from Dudley, I loved watching this and agree with your points about Black Country people, they are hilarious! Great work Geo
No man should ever have to walk round The Black Country for our entertainment - I can say that becsuse I live here.
I love how you whent through Walsall like a maniac 😂
Why are you running? Would walking through the shopping centres be too boring or were you concerned that someone might be after you?
19:45 I've never seen someone look this happy moments after saying a bag of dog poop fell on them.   Love GeoWizard.
Still amazed Storror picked a 26 mile straight line mission rather than the almost made for them No Roads Mission.   I'm assuming Toby's love of nature.
When Rodders is such a plonker that you hit him with the 31:55
I wish I had no social anxiety
your urban adventures are my favourite videos of yours, its facinating watching you travel through the areas we dont normally see.
Growing up around dudley this was a fun video to watch
Love all the challenges and missions, reminds me of some of the things I used to get up to with friends when we were younger. One of our summer activities was 'burn walking' - basically starting at the source of a small river and trying to walk as far as possible down the river without leaving the water in the local hills close to where I stay
BLACK COUNTRY NEW ROAD REFERENCE????
9:56 “you’re wrong! it’s not a road. i make the rules on this channel” is just like my grade 7 teacher constantly saying “I AM THE LAW” whenever we disagreed with him
5:40 when you show her a GeoWizard video
As a fellow yam yam this channel and especially this series brings me joy
please DO NOT impale yourself, sir!
the trash everywhere is just sad
Would love to see the storro boys try something like this
Not a lot of ticks or what? America you would be covered
I hope that title is a Black country New Roads reference
My cousin lives in the Black Country I love their accent
Screw it… if he’s not dead I will be perfectly fine 😂
This guy needs a Vessi sponsorship
am ya
black country, no road????
Would love to see more of these. plenty of Urban shitholes in the UK you could cross...
Gotta love the algorithm, just wrote on your newest video how it inspired me to not take my Bangkok for granted. And then an actual urban video plops up! Brilliant. This is what my 38-year-old ass surely needs! They always told me us millennials wouldn't grow up, well, let's prove them right in the best possible way!
I got a mate who lives in Walsall. Haven't been round there in years as I'm not willing to spend nearly 2 hours on three buses just to end up in Walsall.
I live in walsall , near the routes your taking, this is amazing already,  and seeing all our lingo and different meanings is hilarious 😂😂👍👍
Birthplace of heavy metal that is!
Awesome
So I’m sat on my settee at 1am in Michigan USA and after watching all the others I star to watch this.  You get to Macdonalds and what did I see .. yep Mansfiled Town football fans sat out side. Only my bloody home town ain’t it. Cosmic !  I let out a little whoop and realised I might have been a bit loud so early in morning!
The raw edit is perfect for the pacing of this one-day series.
I'm going to try this literally right now
best channel on youtube
As an American if I saw a man putting on camo outside a mall I'd start running lol 🤪 I'm laughing because otherwise I'd cry
When I've been in 'areas I shouldn't have strictly been in' (and no, I'm not a thief!) I usually go with the 'more is better' option; Hi-viz jacket, hard hat, still camera, clipboard with sheets of paper relating to where I am, and pockets full of pens, tape measures, etc. And walk with the air of authority and 'I'm supposed to be here'. A suit underneath helps to sell it. It's truly astounding how many people will totally ignore you especially if you start taking pictures of drainage channels, making sketches, pretending to be on the phone etc There are nuances to doing this and I must add this isn't something I've done in the last fifteen years or more (and again; I never did anything illegal apart from mild trespassing), but it does work!
I really hope you were up to date with all your tetanus and hepatitis jabs before doing this 🤣🤢
30:27 Someone graffitied the N word on the left brick wall LOL
Please make a new no roads mission Tom! Im craving more
thought he was talking about Warsaw for a while, i was very confused
"Some of you will argue this this ramp, is a road, but it's not, it's just a ramp" Lots to think about.
Very exciting, but the shaky camera along with your running gave me motion sickness. I can only watch this in 10 min segments or so. ^^
Om frum Kiddy! May not be in the Black Country proper but same accent and culture and everything else, even down to the Banks’s. Good to hear the accent again since I’ve lived up north for a while (This is my girlfriends profile though, and she is not from there btw)
I got an axiety attack jist watching you go into that water. I guess i have a phobia of shit water
Hello again me from a month ago!
Nice to see you going through greater Birmingham
Britain 2022 is absolutely fucked.
When they said Europe has walkable cities they weren’t joking around
So "pretty much legal" is code for "I'm fine so long as I don't get caught", right? lol
B*rmingham 🤢🤢🤢
Imagine the amount of used needles out there that youre stepping on
big up the black country
Keeping with the urban theme, I would have worn coveralls with a random name tag.  If you also carry a cardboard box, you'll have them holding open the gates and doors for you to walk through.  No questions asked.
Honestly how did he not find a dead body
I live in wednesbury this was amazing seeing you do this
Nice Oregon shirt.
Humans are the filth of the earth. Dear God
27:50 he thinks a bench for players is a 'stand' but he does recognise something used for heroin? maybe play a bit more sports
This was a great video Black Country Bear Grylls! Always wanted to know what is out there beyond the convrete paths. Missed out on the title of "Black Country Down" though.
Isn't your first mission and you still haven't brought gloves smh🤔
There’s a certain irony that the body of water you’re traversing is called Ford Brook. Where you would normally ford the river and travel on the streets, this time you are “fording” the streets and traveling on the river.
BLACK COUNTRY, NEW ROAD
"I'm not sure why this is so... heavily fortified. It's only a playing field over there." *is standing in a heroin den*
You should do a straight line across sweden
Mirror's Edge, British Edition.
Mind the used needles!
Fucking hell mate what you been stuffing up your nose 👃😆
oh god I know every place on this
American cops when they find out there is a place called black country: 💥💥💥🔫
21 minutes in looks like a sewage pumping station…….  Only discovered your channel yesterday and didn’t know straight lining was a thing but now I’m hooked! Definitely want to plan my own adventures 💪🏻 Thanks for sharing yours Tom!
Im a bit late but wear a yellow vest when youre somewhere where youre not supposed to be
TBE
It's black country out there
The Rodney Throbber comment caught me so off guard. I could NOT stop laughing!
Great fun. Watching from Ontario Canada
Wicked stuff, mate. Absolutely love these adventures. My God, one never imagines Britain a certain way. The brook, for instance. Happy adventuring, friend, and keep up these lovely videos! :)
That first drone shot is from the flats at the end of the street I grew up on. Fancy that. Haha.
19:15 had me creasing 😂
Don't England metro or taxi???
When you started, it felt like watching Faith from Mirror's Edge. Cool!
Hey Tom, I hate to be that guy but I think you made a typo on your disclaimer in the beginning of the vid. No worries though, I could be wrong
@5:39 how excited were you at that exact moment?
Im no electrician but if i see wires in water like on that roof i am not walking through that lol, good video tho
Wading through trash and brambles... dressed in army gear... in summer. And then walks into a McDonalds smelling of sewage water. Absolute madlad. Honestly though, seeing all that trash is depressing. People are disgusting. Imagine how beautiful that brook must've been before humans came and built an ugly city around it.. :(
Damn, this is so ugly and dirty. How anyone voluntarily lives in a city is beyond me
When I saw your TikToks I was gonna say I've got a few bandos I've been trying to find that I bet you'd find in like 3 minutes. Haha. Great work.
Would love to see more straight line urban missions! the best.
so terrible how we treat our precious waterways.
Bothered about looking stupid after running through a shopping centre blabbing away to a camera
*Thumbs up* “Twat”
The little mini map was such a cute touch
Tom's running through town greeting random people, while commiting crimes, like hes trying to get his honor back up in Red Dead Redemption 2.
Tom looked like an average american in his camo poncho
Mirrors edge wallsal edition
2:58 whoa dude....dont include Stourbridge, you'll piss off the real Black Country folk.   Our official location is "just under the B in Brum on the weather" 😁
What is this aspect ration 4:3 or something? What on earth is it that for!
Should of put a high vis on you'd have been golden
You're allowed to drink as soon as the pub allows you to drink
As a Great Barr lad this was even more enjoyable being able to recognise a lot of these places! You. Sir have gained a new Subscriber.
I always eat when I watch Tom's videos. This time, I shouldn't have 🤢
Great video
Love this
Somehow the McDonald's didn't fit in with the organic nature of the adventure!
Can’t believe YouTube didn’t show me this when I’ve literally got notifs on for your channel
Camo in the countyside works really well but camo in a town center looks like you're about to commit terrorism.
10:45 “Look through carefully” - said every girlfriend and wife in the world 😄
This doesn't feel right without the Army gear on...
Mirror's Edge: Engerland Edition
I LIVE THERE!
I despise the use of 4:3 for YouTube. I make an exception for these because you're British and you guys still make T.V. shows in this incredibly outdated format.
West Midlands Conurbation County
best part is all of England will be like that in 100 years time.  i've only been to wales once in the past 15 years but its such a refreshing change from buckinghamshire / oxfordshire / northamptonshire area.  You can actually see the stars there !
Walsall!
Finally a video of the best town in England (lol) Dudley
i loved this series
As a graffity guy and former pot smoker I feel reminded of my youth xD
9:33 it's not a road because the car park belongs to the shops, "road" only counts for public streets maintained by the government
COVID wasn't enough. Looks like you're trying to catch cholera now!
If I was doing this I'd have to wear work style clothes dickies trousers hi Vis vest PPE style. No one would look at you strange it's the urban commo
Love how Tom became more YamYam when ever he saw people YAM ALRIIIIIGHT
If you think that brook is bad, you should see some of the streams in my city. Even the rats avoid 'em.
Now we need to find a good camera that he can use so we can watch it in VR
Those stairwells that smell of faeces is on purpose. It keeps vagrants from loitering or setting up camp in those locations.
VERY big fan of that title
You could have just shimmied across on the grate instead of going in the nasty ditch water :D
27:50 im pretty sure thats the bench for the substitutes not a grandstand
Running across roof tops now...is this turning into a madness?
If I look outside my window right now, I can see the abandoned railway which u passed over right at the start behind home bargains.
I'm imagining your narration just echoing in through the shopping centre roof like the voice of god
Mate there is NO amount of money somebody could have paid me to go into that brook 😂
that brook was so polluted i could smell it from just watching it 🤢
Love the use of Little Britain's music
Bro hard had high vis and clip board will take u anywhere
This is the path my parents had to take to get to McDonald's when they were children
Please do more of these would be interesting doing it through random towns/cities you never know what you might come across is the bit I like about these videos.
I have to say that i love your videos, i really enjoy watching. But the people are really a shit throwing so much garbage near the street..
It’s mad lived in Walsall for 25 years and never knew about half the stuff in this series 😅
"I'm not sure why this is so heavily fortified" he says while standing in the middle of a heroin pit bordering a kid's playing field
Dude never wears gloves. Introducing the "Avoiding another skin infection on my hands" ..a very urban adventrue [PART 1] (Already got hurt with a branch)
Cardiff Bangor or  Llangefni will be the same apart from funny sounds Welsh people
31:04 I can just imagine being above and hearing "Rodney Throbber" echoes from below lol
wow, what a show!
Was this timed or just running through the non danger areas like the Victorian shopping centre just because 😂
bro we used to do shit like this as kids, not to this extent but you brought back so many memories and i'm from birmingham
Everytime I think he says "Warshaw"
IDEA ! Play a map of a country or region and you have to go irl where you guessed. You get a limited amount of time (1min say). From there on you need to get to where the actual location shown on GeoGuessr was.
Oh shit I didnt even know we had some new missions! Hell yeah!
8:40 is that joe musk?!?
Mate you need to wear gloves
your channel = your rules
why isnt anybody mentioning how this entire thing is just one big Black Country, New Road reference
Just found this channel while reading the comments of an Australian survival guys page . 😀  Mate I hope your up to date with your tetanus and hep b shouts.. mad lad. 👍
Up for real life Mirrors Edge anyone?
The Drainage tunnel felt very much like the Game INFRA!
That's crazy!
So he is on a spikey fence and is about to yolo drop into a thicket of brambles. And his comment: "please dont try that at home"  No shit, i dont think there is ANYONE who thinks that is a brilliant idea and will copy you xDDD (Anyone who does, actually will have a giod enough reason that he does not need the Video to give them this idea ;-) )
These types of videos feel more and more like Tom just wanting to have an excuse to go places he shouldnt
Really appreciate these adventures, man.  Utterly fascinating to watch.  And better you, than me.
The spoilers are so annoying, we're watching the video, we don't need to see the parts coming up... it's much better to see them for the first time as we get to them. Really good video though.
More interesting than driving through the black country, for sure.
why the fuck are you running lmao
0:29 - It's also truly awful urban planning. A disgrace to behold.
I reckon Storror would be great at this, a collab with them would be unfathomable. Not only can they move, but they have a certain amount of expertise in getting kicked off of private property
Question (theoretical): I'm from BBC and I think people would love your content on television. I offer you a good sum of money and facilities to do a Crossing Great Britain In (The Longest) Straight Line television series. Would you do it?
I love how writes "certain amount of expertise", it's humble choice of words considering other disclaimer options that are more frequently used.
This is brilliant, great new mission idea
most of this video i spent going. “OMG THATS WHERE THIS HAPPENED IN MY LIFE”
10:00 "Into this car park. Which also isn't a road." He says while crossing a road.
I once made it between the east coast of England to the west coast without touching a single dual carriageway. (All be it, it was in the north) I thought that was tricky but this looks like on a different level. Kudos 👍
Omg, that pub at the start is my local. That black gate used to literally be my front door. You started this right outside my old flat. The service yard you walked down was basically my front drive.   Edit: at one point in the video you walk right by my new house too, but I'm not telling you where that is haha
Quite romantic these desolate brownfield sites considering the price of land in this country. I'll never forget when they found a decomposed corpse on a roundabout in Wolverhampton, had lain undiscovered for years apparently
why is no one talking about how he walked through sewer water?????  like plz tell me everyone thinks thats disturbing and its not just bc im studying env
"guys please dont climb a fence lile this at home im very experienced" *walks through fucking sewer water*
Lol for this whole challenge did you say there's just a regular trail you could've taken? Haha well you're right about one thing, trespassing and sewage diving makes for more entertaining content
I love your channel so much mate
Please dont do the following at home: Climb security fences, tresspass, use overflow tunnels and for goodness sake - never vist Walsall
Why the fuck do people actually throw away bags of dogshit!? They do it around here as well, but it doesn't make any sense! It'd be better to just leave the shit there and let it decompose, meanwhile in a plastic bag it'll take forever to break down and the plastic even longer!
Can't get my head around the fact that you don't have to go in a straight line.
Wow that, that is disgusting. Have fun.
Haha Tom is a Black Country, New Road fan nice
Even if it's not a challenge, I love these videos because of the storytelling and editing.
Best one yet! Great content like always.
30:28 Is that the N-word spray-painted on that wall?
So happy there are more missions! They are so fun to watch and they inspire me greatly
Dude, you have covid and you are running around without a mask or anything? Thats reckless.
Perhaps your most daring feat yet
Not proud to say I live in this shithole but good to see it get some attention
You should do a link up with the Storror boys if you want to do urban missions. Rooftops and security evasion? No problem..
Absolutely mental to go into that dirty ass brook
All your real life vlog challenges are amazing
do you want amoebas in your urethra? 'cause that's how you get amoebas in your urethra...
This video highlights how depressing and dreary most of the scenery is here...
I love these type of videos from GeoWizard, I can't find any of these pure content anywhere else <3
I grew up in Smethwick, Oldbury, and Wednesbury. Great to see some familiar sights! Also I feel like the guy in Maccy's was a fantastic example of UK vs US customer service. Less pretense and over the top fake happiness. He even used the classic answer to being asked how he is "not too bad". Should honestly be the catchphrase of Britain. There's always at least some degree of things being shit, but it's not too bad.
Sees plastic sheet. "Dead Body, no" 🤣🤣🤣
please make the vids 1920x1080
Oy mahyt, thurrs a blawwk in camaw dahwn thurrr
Yes.
at round 21min, that's an area where they rinse off equipment and machinery that have worked with chemicals. The water can't just drain into the soil because it would poison the soils, so they make those areas where all the water spillage can be collected and later on processed and cleaned up
Tom wearing an Oregon shirt always warms my heart as an Oregonian.
Another amazing concept for a challenge! Please do more!
at 30:29 the graffiti on the wall says the no no word
Do more of these!  Great new format, and can be appreciated in so many ways.  Seeing the hidden corners of urban areas and all the ugliness and beauty.  Good times!  Thanks from USA
12:20 - What does this man have against wearing tough gloves when jumping into brambles??? 😂  Edit : 17:50 - HAHAHAHHAHAAHHAHA HE KNOWS HE SHOULD BE WEARING GLOVES 😂😂😂  Edit 2 : OMG and he even has gloves with him, he doesn't even have them on!!  Edit 3 : Eating those nuggets without taking the jacket off is the bravest thing in this whole video.
...is the emphasis on the FIRST syllable of 'McDonald's' in the UK?    ...really?
Welcome to TICK country.
DAMN!  Wet shoes RIGHT out of the box!
Did Verity not bring a spare t-shirt on the second meetup?
Urban no roads was staple for me in my daily life 10 years ago and I enjoyed it a lot
How is that, although he is using modern equipment, it looks like it was filmed in the early 10s
23:48 a rotten bunch of a rat king ?

This is my favourite thing you've done, Tom. I didn't know how much I needed this in my life until it arrived.
straight line mission north korea to south korea
Black Country; New Road.
Dude is playing video games irl.
You are very British. I’m just saying in case you forgot.
weyam Wolves
If you want a real challenge, do a straight line across Ukraine
ur such a legend
Respect for jumping in that sewer
The google maps view hurts, so car centric
Have you ever gotten really injured doing this sort of thing?  I'd hate to see you step on a beartrap or something
This is and is going to be like The Whitewicks and Trekking Ant crossed with Bear Grylls!   #NotSpon  #TheyAreMyFellowsandFellowette
I wonder if Tom is a fan of BCNR
Get some sunglasses bro, you will be invincible in them.
Bringing the content back home, I've always got love for my home town walsall too
I really like this almost videogame style adventure!
Most beautiful nature preserve in Bongistan
Not gonna lie this one didn't do it for me personally, I appreciate the boy trying something new though. Looking forward to the next straight line mission.
I would hate to do this in AU with all the things that want to bite you.
Oh my gosh we're only 8 minutes in and I'm already nervous
Tom really went lets play GTA in real life and get 5 stars wanted
You were very fortunate when you got to the club house , that is the railway club , I clean the windows there and have a drink before watching Walsall matches . The grass pitched you went through are also where West Midlands police train their dogs and they are there very frequently . You would have preferred to be arrested than those canines getting after you !
Finest clobber
LETS GOO
Good thing he calls it a railway and not a railroad.
Very cool to finally have urban area adventures.
Mate I haven’t smelled anything since February because of covid and honestly it is kind of blessing. When you think about it humans are a stinky bunch.
I recall you jumping a fence and to almost get hit by a car on your first wild hike.   Cheers bud, stay safe, keep calm, stay clear of guard dogs.
i gotta say a video in such an urban environment is a welcome change ;)
What is a heroin?
So much litter - the human race is fucked :(
It makes me sad to see the amount of litter in Britain
that small stand is a subs bench not a stand
Only Tom could make a walk through a Black Country sewer brook, look and feel like a casual stroll through an Amazonian river 😅
Tom reminds me more and more of Bear Grylls at this pace. Might be drinking some odd water soon?
black country, no road? did this whole video just happen because the band black country, new road´s name kinda sounded close to a good video idea?
TBE
verity the real tireless MVP
23:53 What is that, I ask you?  Matter.
ima watch this to see if I see anywhere ik in it cause I live in a northern section of the black country
“Lovely little disgusting burger” was an underrated joke
so its a ramp, alright. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
My man rediscovered parcours
black country, new road reference!
ii fuckin love this channell
A simple definition for a road would be "a place where traffic regulations apply"
That water your walking through is where raw sewage is released! at 24:20 where you are walking through the water those long green strands you can see underwater only form where sewerage is frequently outflowed! The Environment Agency says that Sewage discharge is continuous in there, I hope you washed well afterwards, or at least your hands before you ate those Chicken Nuggets.
Dude you have got to get some goggles for those bramble patches, it's so nervracking watching all those twigs and shit smacking your face
This should be shown to people who think England is all tea rooms, red phone boxes and downton abbeys.
Easy for him this time. As long as there's no (angry) farmer!
“Dead body? Nope.” Oh the normal every day questions.
Should do one of these in Mansfield another proper shithole🤣
Nice Oregon shirt! Since watching Straight Line Mission #3 I've played with the idea of crossing Lane County in a straight line. Absolutely love the content!
How not to touch filthy shit? How to avoid getting hurt by brambles? GLOVES!
The old rail line bits reminded be of Beau Miles: Run the Line! You're both similar in some ways, sound guys full of wisdom and witticisms, reinventing the idea of adventuring.
Surprised you didnt find a body
Nice one.
hey mate, if you've ever found a pair of gloves that are blackberry/bramble proof, let me know, I need a pair...
Rather it be a bag of dogshit then human shit lol
If you walked this route in the 90s you’d have probably found yourself 30-40 porn mags.
I love watching all this as I’m from the Black Country this to me is hilarious imagining people who don’t know it that well watching you climbing the old shopping centre 😂😂 keep it up Loving the vids ❤️
Could I come here and just fix some of the brook so its an epic hangout spot, stuff looks 'orible..
Love this challenge, the urban areas or our.. lovely country.. make an intersting backdrop.
23:02 You can hear the echo from the tunnel!
Goofy ahh geoguessr
When people talk about Bri’ish “pe’ull” they be talking bout this
And here I was wanting an unscripted "Security guard chases parkourist across roof"
I wish I could speak with British accent
We got chan running our cash converters in New Jersey
"Do you know what? I saw a fish..." LOL
Your such a legend brother,your videos give me nostalgia
It's horrific how dirty some places are because people are too lazy to bin it. still another great adventure.
"Very very black country people, might I add, or polish" "That looks like rat central. oh well, let's go through."
jay a new mission :D :D f yeah getting the popcorn and soda right now!
26:29, mate no one is going near the guy who just emerged out of the sanitary waste industrial runoff gutter waters.
Can you redub "security" with "Farmer" please
Loving the Black Country, New Road reference. Keep it up, Tommy boy!
That babbling brook looked majestic
I hope you've got all the shots ie Tetanus, hepatitis.
Man channeled every part of the Black Country with that alright 😂
Why does he run??
I dont know what I'd do if it weren't for Tom existing.
Ah... good to see GeoWizard has bumped into one of the wild dog shit trees that sprout up in the great british countryside.
You really are just making shit up now mate
Walsall in all its glory
When you said it's just about legal you didn't really believe it did you? lol I mean clearly, it's trespassing all the way through
geowizard meets ally law  6:01 he even almost said it!  also this just feels like a kaizo version of a straight line mission
hey Tom, great video! What camera are you using?
Recognising the BCNR reference in the thumbnail: "Nice".
Кто с тик тока?
Good video!
The pinnacle of Britishness is truly giving someone a thumbs up 👍 and muttering “twat” under your breath 😂
Without Verity you'd be a hollow man.
Take gloves next time 👍🏾
I can’t believe you got into that water, I don’t even think it was necessary. You’re a crazy guy.
Where can someone buy all the kit you have
You should find some completely abandoned land, put a claim in for it and create GeoHQ
At 11:57 the double yellow lines indicate that it's a road?
Womb
Bc, nr is a good band.
Ah, the ever patient Verity! What a legend.
when is new episode arriving
dont think anyone on the planet has ever given off geography a level energy more than tom
Black Country, New Road is amazing
Mirror's Edge GeoWizard
Should of took a hiviz jacket
Haha your nuts mate, quality original idea again!
This feels like a bonus level on Crash Bandicoot.
You know the old adage to check if water if safe: "if you see fish, water's delish!"  This isn't an actual saying please nobody take this as actual advice and drink dodgy water and get poisoned and make me liable for it, thank you.
LOVE this idea!!
Adventure and a half that amazing
May or may not be able to claim one of the tags in that storm drain...
Widescreen when?!
what date was this recorded? your just walking with a tshirt in april?
Apologies in advance... 5:38 Thats what she said
Makes me cringe seeing you climb over the security fencing, a few years back I got my foot caught as I jumped off and my weight caused the spikes to go through my shoe in to my foot as I was hanging upside down by my foot…
This is even more exciting as it feels more risky :D L0ve it!
Still no gloves
You're gonna stumble across a dead body one day 100%
GeoWizard out here creating drug smuggling routs through Birmingham
9:50 What defines a 'road' has absolutely nothing to do with whether it takes car traffic.
Nice to see Walsall in any other video than night out fights or on the news cause somebody got stabbed.
at 19:21 when he says yehyeh
This is so weirdly entertaining
Watching this before Police makes Tom delete this video
4:50 this storror video looks a little different
Why is high quality content in the year 2022 dragged down by being 4:3...?
i have dreams about doing stuff like this, but in more dirty places like sewer systems.
25:06 minecraft sound effect
"It's not a road it's just a really wide, multilaned ramp" - Tom, probably, one day :P
Can someone explain the laws. How can’t the police arrest Tom after posting evidence of trespassing, multiple times.  I mean, I am a huge fan and love Tom, but damn is the police just that incompetent?
Is the title a Black Country, New Road reference??
The sounds of the shopping centre are so eerie haha
loving this challenge already!
black country is Indiana without the good people
black country, no roads
you should have gotten a orange vest for the ultimate camouflage
Mate me walking around the roads in black country makes me want to commit sudoku and you walking through all that garbage and bushland. I applause your bravery. Now go get checked for every possible disease in the world.
Mans just running through buildings and streets while talking to him self like a mad man
Proper good urbexing this is
if you brought a hi-vis jacket this would've been the easiest challenge yet
I feel like ww1 putties on your boots would of been very useful here  Oh and some bug spray
why are you running the entire time haha
I was just thinking about a gta 5 challenge run in which you never touched a road
Walsall looks absolutely beautiful this time of year
Been watching 2 minutes and im already strapped in for this
Tom in adventure mood and gear is quite hot. Wondering if Verity ever asks for some role play 😅👀
I like how this series slowly progressed from crossing the odd farmers field or back-garden to this. I do question what we have driven Tom to do for our entertainment!
The brook seems to be the local areas sewage pipe and the empty space under the asphalt is for sewage and rain storage for pumps to pump further for example into that brook. Nice vid tho, nice you didnt drink it
i am only 2 minutes in and this editing is already sooo fucking good, love it, keep it up man ✌
I love how your wife is okay with all this and even helps.
Reminds me of missions me and my mates did through the scrublands in Essex
bro really said "heroin apparatus"
This might be the most miserable video yet…a great introduction to England!
It seems Birmingham is far more dirty than London from what I have seen. We have litter down here around London but not to that high degree you showed in this video in Walsall
This was definitely not the best advert for Walsall😂😂😂
Imagine being an animal in an urban area. We are so filthy, it is dreadful. Leaving our trash and gunk everywhere. Thank god you didn't have a fully intact sense of smell...
Im from the south and often use these words out of the black country dialect sheet ye put up Ya Giya Ta Summat Ay? Scran I also use wench too but thats more of an insult
you really need some less suspicious gear to wear, running around in baggy camo makes me so nervous for you.
This looks as if it's filmed from the perspective of a wild animal, that is afraid of roads and needs to cross the town avoiding all human contact.
I love the Little Britain Intro!
You should do more videos of you just going on a journey, it doesn’t have to be a challenge it would be entertaining to simply watch you adventure through beautiful landscapes
I like the musical reference
why would you do this to yourself? lmao but man its actually sad watching this and seeing jsut how shit your home is. full of litter and crap.
dude u should collab with storror, make them a line and they cant touch the ground or something cool like that like the floor is lava
You know so much cool places you should do a collab with Storror
For anyone wondering why the video is 4:3 instead of fully widescreen 16:9 like I was, it appears he is just trying to show the most accurate visual perspective. I didn't know this but GoPro (and most cameras) use a 4:3 sensor, it can only 'fake' widescreen by cutting off the top and bottom of the image and zooming in. So you're losing out on some quality and a lot visual information that could be important just to fill in the sides the screen. This isn't a big deal if you can actually see what you're filming and frame your shots, but when using a headmount it's not possible and the top/bottom of the image becomes more important; better to show more of the horizon and what you're walking towards as well as the ground.
Oh my god those little shopping centres in Walsall at the beginning took me vividly back to shopping centres around Birmingham I haven't thought about in well over a decade.
GLOVES Tom, buy some gloves!
Advice for trespassing on security managed areas, walk like you own the place. Running around is sketchy and alerts security that you are not supposed to be there. Lastly you can easily tell them you are a photographer if caught, much easier to explain and nobody really questions it
4:3?
Man crosses rat-infested sewers for some nuggets
According to Google: "Road. Noun. A wide way leading from one place to another, especially one with a specially prepared surface for vehicles."  By this definition, your entire mission is a failure, because the ramp is a road.  Google also provides a second definition: "A series of events or a course of action that will lead to a particular outcome."  By this definition, the entire mission is also a failure, because you follow the course of action (or road) of not using roads to reach Dudley (your intended outcome).  Google also provides a third definition: "A partly sheltered stretch of water near the shore in which ships can ride at anchor."  By this definition, assuming a sufficiently small ship, the mission is, once again, a failure, since a small enough ship could fit in the brook, making the brook a "road."  The moral of the story? Fuck Google.
This'll be an interesting series to see you do, I've always been interested in urban environments, just like you.. I even urbex sometimes, and it's so fun.
You're a legend, mate. Thanks for being you! :)
Geoff Marshall could probably give you a full run down of the history of that abandoned train station.  I mean, Google is a thing, so I probably could too, but let's leave it to the professional :)
But will he title his next Geoguessr vid Ants From Up There?
"I know, gloves, I know. I'll put them on in a minute."  Tom reading my mind like a boss.
Absolute pinnacle of british engineering
Lived here my whole life! <3
this guys going to random places in random countries while i thought getting lost on the bus home was adventurous
Great video, but if ya cant smell coz of covid but can smell poop then you can smell. covid is in the head more than anything.
That was pretty tense when you first went into the water.
As someone who lives in Wolverhampton, as much as I don't care whether I'm part of the Black Country or not I will accept it! Still, at least you showed off the..."best?" parts of Walsall!
YES  !!!!!   was just thinking will there be another epic mission  😀👍
Black Country, New Road tribute???
i need the next ep asap this is so addictive
“No one was ever there” …except for the 34+ minute record of it viewed by thousands on YouTube 😂  PS I will be surprised if you dress like that and someone doesn’t think you are some sort of terrorist
22:48 fatberg
What's up with those gnarly barbed fences? Wouldn't a normal chain link fence suffice?
Has anyone ever seen GeoWizard and Mike Skinner in the same room at the same time?!
wow
00:48 Oh, Bramble, Old Fiend, we meet again... Things are going to get brambly.
Do one with @tgfbro, that would be hilarious
Always love you challenges! Of course car parks aren't roads, they're car parks!
Tom’s becoming the next Ally Law???!!
a shame your line doesnt cut through my hometown bilston, you probably would've had a bost nose and twenty stab wounds in your chest (also most industrial estates are "fortified" due to teenagers and smackheads, robbers etc.)
You dont see this anywhere else ladies and gents, this is the internet at it finest
Black Country, No Road, nice
no one getting the Black Country, New Road reference
No way The man innovates again
Mate, why didn't you just wear a hi-vis vest and WALK not run with a notepad and you'd get away with anything
this is cracking news for myself this morning
I love your missions, they are so entertaining! 😬 Can‘t wait, to see the next bit.
Just don't get why you are running?? 😕😕 Is there a time limit?
That fox could teach him a thing or two about avoiding roads.
If I buy your music can I use it with your permission in my own travel-themed videos on TravelBugs?
Love that I got an advert for West Midlands Railways while watching this 😆
Trains every half hour from Wallsall to Dudley change Birmingham New St...duh...not the brightest spark in the fire are we ?
Gew on the black county
I LOVE THESE VIDEOS and I think you do too even tho ur in pain u probably still love it
Should buy some tradesmen gear so you fit in a bit more but you’ll still be protected
Was the title on the thumbnail a nod to the band Black Country, New Road?
16:08 oh for fox sake!
I missed your Journey type content, love that you got back out there so fast! Keep up the great work.
7:55 fortune favours the bold
Hey where did u get ur camo gear.
21:49 to 22:08 hmmmmm
Love the bcnr reference in the thumbnail!!
Boom! And the guy produces another winner. Already looking forward to part two. Both 'Live' narration and voiceover stuff is top notch and professional, yet relatable. Bostin! 😁👍
He should try this in Grimsby next.
That wasn't dog shit.
Black Country, new road reference?
I love the Oregon shirt :)
You should do a livestream where people pick your routes
Yeah another adventure!  I guess Tom has never seen the Jamie Oliver episode about pink slime and McDonald's chicken nuggets.  I've never ate a chicken nugget since, and that's about 15 years!
For some reason this just starts playing every time I turn my tv on!
Is there Poison Ivy in England?
why are you running
Loved this tom. Wonderful in the black country ay it xd
Don't know which is worse, the retail parks or the brambles and bags of dog shit.  Welcome to Walsall.
This is my absolute favorite youtube channel.  The geoguessr content is great but the mission content is absolutely GOLD. Keep it up Tom and I'll buy you a drink if you're ever in North Carolina... although I don't recommend any straight line missions through private property here.
into a carpark thats also not a road?? as he crosses a road?????
My family moved from Walsall to Canada in 1957. I'm glad ahaha
Wholesome content
ANOTHER BANGER
Yes, i dont try to climb a fence at home. :D
As a Tamworth lad born and bred, I’d been to Walsall plenty as a youth, this brings back such nostalgia vibes… can’t believe that first shopping centre is still open!!!
Any clue if he's gonna do Geoguesser Duels?
how is this only part 1 can't wait for part2
I would love it if in this format you stick with the camera on your head because the constant perception swaps (atleast in the first section) gets to be a little jarring, the google maps overhead view is a nice addition (could be added to any camera speedup footage in the future, but editing these probably takes ages already)
the Black Country, New Road reference in the thumbnail was unexpected
Yay. Thank you for making me feel at home. Hate being here most of the time but thanks all the same.
Straight line mission across Monaco soon ?
"Yeah, yeah :)"
Waiting for the Super GT comment 👀
Genius!
I need that part 2 juice Tom, squirt it right into my eye veins
This is so fun! Crazy to think malls were the place to go in the 80's and 90's and now most people shop from home. All the malls shut down here in Cali
Rodney Throbber
“Good chance of seeing people now, very very Black Country people might I add….or Polish” 😂😂
black country new road
0:11 "Britain! Britain! Britain!" ...i really miss Little Britain
What a wonderfully adventurous episode again. Also, that brook was surprisingly nice with all the river water-crowfoot considering all the industry.
black country, no road
Is the thumbnail "Black Country, No Roads" a reference to the band or is the band name referencing something else?
This video is pretty PEPEGA!!!
this channel is a gift that keeps on giving, absolutely love your work man!
I love your geoguesser videos but I could truly watch 100s of videos like this and the straight line mission and be soo happy. Cheers! Can’t wait for the next one!
This is fucking barmy ahahah fair play lad
“I can always run back down into the river” :)
Why is he running all the time? haha
looking forward to this one. I like the idea of getting to see some of the locals as well. being British I've always had a fair interest in some of the crooked slangs other places have
Love the Black Country, New Road reference in the thumbnail. I see you Tom
Parkour Parkour
Amazing work, looking forward to your next video
just take the 4H
HALESOWEN PRIDE
Big main character energy in this video.
Joining storror soon
10:20 let's get ready to brambleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Who needs a city walk I've got Tom running through Walsall
Adventuring on nature is nice and I honestly enjoy it, but walking alone in a public place, not wanting to be seen feels way so good
10:16 Crossing Iceland in a straight line
when your walking through yards and private car parks you should just whip a high viz out of your pocket and throw it on, nobody would bat an eye lid at you.
Being from the black country (Wolverhampton) myself this was fun to watch 😂.
Should start wearing a high vis when your on roofs or in industrial areas you'd go unnoticed.
"bag of dog shit just fell on me" yeah sounds like the black country
Awesome, so gripping.
That's festy as lol
wait how did you guys beat covid?
It's so lovely to follow this on Google Maps. It really allows you to follow the path from landmark to landmark ... well, "landmark". It's an adventure on a small scale, but an adventure nonetheless. Even the smallest crossroads becomes a defining moment. Every parking lot is a biome in itself. Every stretch of drainage ditch is a dungeon. The McDonald's a mile and a half from where you started is like a well-deserved house of respite after a long trek through wilderness. Every building you pass feels like it has significance.  The storytelling is superb here. It really feels like a grand adventure deserving of a multi-chapter saga, despite covering a stretch you could comfortably walk (along conventional routes) in three hours.  I'm eagerly awaiting the continuation, already wondering how the mighty obstacle of the railroads underneath the M6 will be overcome. I can see one possible route, but how will he get there from the McDonald's? The suspense is nerve-raking.
Tom - how can i add gross into missions, Do it in the City!
love him doing this by my local area
Loved the warning at the middle. But we all know, if you can do it,  the average 5 year old will sail through.
Great mission. I don't like the map though!
Guy. I LOVE that you are keeping that 16/9 style. ^^ It gives me kind of the same feelings, as if I am returning to my grandparents house there everything is still like 20 years ago. ^^  I mean in a positive way. But it kind of looks good. The 16/9 format wasn´t that bad. even today.
I Love that your from round where I am just makes me love your channel even more pure class
you should do a shirt that says "this is one of the worst things i've ever done"
I though it was reference to Black Country, New Road
im really hoping this title is also a nod to black country new road
Parkour
Non-aggressive parkour
These missions are so great. I love em.
Black Country, New Road❌ Black Country, No Road✅
black country, no roads lmaooo
its so funny to see tom complaining about the litter and loads of carparks when this just looks normal to me as an american, minus the sidewalks, we don't really have those
Call of duty 4 modern warfarmer
I hope there’s a security chase in the next episode along the rooftops like those old videos from 2015 that people used to make
Definitely an idea for you to consider in the future, is getting a safety vest/high visibility vest, especially if you plan to do more of these urban type missions! There has been tests done and the results are that people become very ignorant of you once you're wearing the vest, as they immediately think you're a worker of some sort and go about their business. It won't of course work whilst crossing some farmers land in possible future straight line missions, but as you're going through shop' service areas and climbing on roofs of shopping centers, it might divert everyones attention from you for just a tiny bit at least.
I did the same things up until I turned 18, used to also like climbing buildings but stopped before it could land me in jail. Best of luck.
Man please start wearing gloves on the reg. matey of mine was climbing an Astro fence he did all the time, then his foot slipped and he de-gloves his hand. Nasty stuff
mans has just become storror lol
Sent this in to Walsall Tourism Council, eh? 😂
Useful tip: get a luminiscent safety west and safety helmet to cross construction sites, roofs and most urban areas. Everyone will think you're supposed to be there and won't "cop" you. It works here in Russia with "Diggers" (underground research enthusiasts) who can just walk up to any manhole, open it and get inside undetected.
i could have had 15 guesses how you where gonna pass that gate at 4:56 and none of them would have been right
cant tell if the black country, no road is a reference to black country, new road or not… i’d like to think tom is a fan
23:00 meanwhile fish winks 4th eye and waves a mandible as it swims away
If I saw a guy dressed in camo gear come out of the bushes waving to everybody like he's the center of the world, I'd assume he's a serial killer
this made me feel dirty
I love this man so much idk how he does it
did anyone else think he was saying Warsaw until he showed the spelling?
I love how when you say "black dountry" so casually its sounds like your saying something racist casually
this gives me secondhand embarrassment
Who do i have to talk to to get these videos in a reasonable aspect ratio
why not just walk next to the roads? on the sidewalk? a sidewalk counts as a road but a parking lot doesn't?
Change your name to Tom Brambles or Tom Bramblesworth, already.
You really should have teamed up with Ally Law for this.
Black Country, No Road
I met some of your friends at vandy they told me about good luck on your music nd journey mate
This was a dedicated classic in the day of uploading already
This is fuckin hilarious🤣 hilarious stoned 🤣
black country new road reference 😁
did geowizard have to sprint through this? lmao
Welcome to the best new six-part Danish crime drama
Is it from last year? Because everything is already so green. Much greener than here in southern Germany even so it's much further north.
As if I live in Walsall and did not realise your local, should have recognised by the accent!!
Nice Black Country, New Road reference xd
Interesting even if you're still filming in that weird and annoying 4:3 ratio
I love this video being from Stourbridge in the Black Country and watching this channel for about 2 years i live about 15 mins from Dudley and it’s great to see the Black Country being recognised
Fantastic new challenge with loads of potential for future routes!
Disgusting areas.
this could really be a tv series.   get the producers to say "ok, you give us the go-ahead to go through your town, and in exchange, part of the crew will clean up the trash along the path we take."   do a public service wherever you go, and they'll thank you instead of saying "hey mate you cant be here!"
It could be super interesting to have a route like this through a city in a collab with the storror guys maybe :D
I'm defenetly not an expert but the algae you encountered when crossing the river seems to me to be "green algae" (thats its name in french at least, i don't know its name in english) which is higly poisonous and comes from agriculture and chemical wastes. This type of algae has killed several pets like dogs and given terminal cancer to people who have touched it. I would suggest going to an expert or somebody who knows algae better than me and see if what I'm saying is tangible. If so, please be careful and take appropriate actions. Stay safe mate!
7:22 I wonder what the plan was if someone actually came to open the door, lol.
'no roads' indeed XD
did not expect the little Britain theme but it was nice
Man, get your hi-vis and a clipboard on you. Gets you anywhere.
Tom i feel like you put alot of faith into some of your climbs, as an example at 31:36 i would've given the gate a good little tug before putting my weight on it If u fall backwards there that's a bit scary..... You certainly have more experience than me in this kind of stuff and it's not a great example as the gate looks in good shape, but stay safe :)
Does Tom do this professionally or work and do this on the side? Would love him to do uploads 2 or 3 times a week and do it full time with patreon
Love the Little Britain style intro XD
Another brilliant series idea Tom. I love your content.
Black Country, No Road
This is great
I've heard its new road is very experimental
Collab with Storror on one of these except don't pick a route thru the area beforehand.
Walking into a security guard seems less frightening than walking into a random farmer somewhere in wales, because you can kind of expect how the security will handle the situation, wheras the farmer ...

“…if anyone sees me they’re going to think I’m absolutely mad, and I may well be” 😂 💜
Such a great idea for a mission.
I'd love for you to do a challenge in stoke at some point in the future, although the real challenge might be trying to figure out what would be entertaining to do in stoke lol
TOM! You should keep a light high vis vest in your camo jacket, would be useful in the factory areas and urban areas in general. A retractable ladder could also help but its hefty.
appreciate the oregon shirt it's quite nice
Need to get yerself some big gardening gloves next time to hel with the brambles.
I think this is your best series yet. You have taken an area that people would not have thought of as being difficult to navigate and created a great challenge. Im sure people often pass by these seemingly abandoned urban areas and wonder what would happen if they jumped the fence.  Well, now we know!
Im really looking forward towards this series.
It is completely disorienting watching Tom NOT walk in a straight line.
I live in brownhills so watching this is hilarious as Walsall is so close and I’m 5 mins from Aldridge
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.   (Romans 12:1) - Jesus Christ is our only Savior.
24:37 We see you.  We think you're absolutely mad.
Black country ay we
Thinking of an epic crossover... Tom vs Storror - Race Across Walsall Challenge.
Looks like Tom is a fan of Black Country, New Road!
LOL I know it's a catch phrase but you should probably stop using 'get in!' while sneaking around like a thief :P
Could always just tell people you are on a tv show when you are having to hide and run from people
Such a weird video lol, expected from geowizard haha
do more urban straight lines
Nice trip, thanks for sharing !
Southampton would be good for this, lots of roof tops, tunnels etc
Where are your gloves mate ?
Crazy new idea and I love it, I can't wait for episode 2, see you there!
The editing was really funny on this one
Shoutout to Verity for supporting all your crazy-ass ideas <3 she's a true hero
Like how you wear a bright yellow t-shirt at the start to make you visible to everyone 💪 I'll assume you're doing this on hard difficulty 👍
Black Country, No Road
I enjoy the GeoGussr stuff but the real reason I am subbed is for this sort of content. Great series so far, if has a new layer of uncertainty and immersive dread at what is around the next corner. Looking forward to episode 2
9:59 thats a road
POV Your mom when she sees me 5:40
not scared of swinepox >.<
"juuuust about legal"  only because it's a civil issue, right? :D
Amazing new series! Thank you for this!
I think Tom Davies would be the perfect Taskmaster contestant.
A few months ago I found myself searching google maps for a driving route from Market Harborough, Leicestershire to Petersfield, Hampshire without using any roundabouts. I now recognise that this is a result of what YOU have done to me Tom.  Good going, love the mission.
Once again I thank you for the excellent subtitles. Just so you know all this hard work isn't going unnoticed. One of my neighbors is busy mowing their lawn right now, and since it's pretty warm in my appartment I really can't close the windows. So the subtitles actually help a lot. :)
Was really hoping Tom would make his way past dudley to the mighty Stourbridge/Brierley Hill
ANND He'S BacK With Another BANGER!
Literally just out a sewage infested river then strolls  into Macdonalds. How hygienic.
Tom is just constantly being chased by volatiles and that is why he is running during the video
the road is lava
What is the genre of songs he uses in his outro ??
What a great idea!
Tom: *Says a car park isn't a road* Also Tom: *Calls leaving a car park "going off road"*
Good old Dudlayyyy.
I don't know many times you are going to get this exact comment but there's no fuckin way you could do this in America.
Hello chicken nugget!
This video has Billie Eilish style
Bro told the fox to shut up😂
I'm not too far away in Warwickshire and would kill myself if I had to live in this god forsaken shit hole of a region.
As someone who has lived in Walsall (specifically New Invention) all my life, it really is so entertaining watching you wade over the roof of the Old Square and almost surreal just seeing you sprint through the town centre that I've walked through probably thousands of times 😂  Cheers for putting the Black Country into the fold with these videos, its really cool seeing a lad from Aldridge spreading bits of the culture to the wider YouTube audience - been a fan since the first Wales mission but this really is so interesting to me as a local. Next time I do my weekly shop at ASDA in Walsall with my flatmates I'll imagine you Sam Fishering your way over the Old Square - hope to catch you in spoons sometime soon!  Ta cocka
Did you see any Ants From Up There?
Get in!
you ally lawed the first part!
probably already been suggested but Id recommend dressing like a construction worker with high vis and all that so you can fit in a bit better climbing out of sewers and jogging through lots
In the parking lot getting dressed in fatigues looking like a man who's just delivered his "manifesto" to a lawyer and is gearing up for his final stand... Ahh it's just Tom being a cheeky explorer
That wasn't a fish, the condoms have just mutated into lifeforms.
so. goooood.  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for putting up with this twat, Verity.
Appreciate the BCNR reference in the thumbnail
Tom you should give 10sec NMPZ a try again soon. Loved watching that series, but then again, I enjoy all your videos. Cheers!
Absolutely love your work man. Thank you. Was wondering what boots you wear? Some friends and I are doing a long walk this summer and am in need of sturdy gear.
I love these videos so much
Car revs engine  Tom: Oh Shut Up!
Continuing to live my adventures through you. Amazing.
33:12 what is this exchange?  mcd: jus a 4 piece? tom: yeah cheers mcd: **my yurts** tom: yeahareyou? mcd: yeahnottoobadbuddy
Forgot I wasn't watching storror at parts .
I knew this was going to be fucking mental when the first obstacle was a shopping mall roof.
"It's primark I'm worried about now" - Tom, 2022
Hot tip: wear a high vis. nobody will bat an eyelid.
You are going through parts of civilization and vegetation where i'd hide a body.
It's quite stark to witness just how horrible the environment is in city Vs your straight line missions. Imagine if anyone who ever thought it was a bit grim just spent a day doing some community clean up work...
absolutely love this, would be fun to see more challenges similar to this one
Proper mucky mission this is mate! Wouldn't want to be a human but scaled down to 5mm height and living inbetween ur toes for this one mate!
21:00 looks like a pumping station/storage tank for sewage or fresh water
Isn't the first music from little Britain?
I think I speak for a lot of people when I say how much I love your content Tom and how interesting all of these challenges are to me and my friends. We are big walkers/adventurers but the level you work at is just legendary 🙌
I know there are lots of comments on this video but you would LOVE a board game called who knows where! there is a map and you have to put a counter thing in the square where you think the answer of the question is. there are also picture rounds where you locate the location of the picture like geoguessr!!
Grand theft Walsall
When I thought Tom’s videos couldn’t get any better, queue little Britain themed intro
Yeye
Using a massively dialled-up midlands accent in the hope it would detract from the  sight of a man in full camou running down a high street. Brilliant. A proper 9/10 on the Frank Skinner scale.
You going to catch all the hepatitis, all the STDs and a new corona
What is the classical song you used at the beginning ?
everything you say is so quotable, bloody brilliant stuff
"Oh that's really nice, what was I worried about?" Said the first man to grow nipples on his knees after contact with the Black Country swamp
If you're using the true definition of "Road" under the Road Traffic Act 1935, then car parks, alleys, ramps and anything not a thoroughfare such as cl de sacs are NOT roads...
Carol Thompson said that J. R. R. Tolkien's description of the grim region of Mordor "resonates strongly with contemporary accounts of the Black Country" & in Elvish Sindarin language, Mor-Dor means Dark (or Black) Land.
we need a round of applause for Verity on these trips. Can't wait for part 2
Assassins Creed 2022
5:35-5:45 copyright and a treat
Black country, no roads
This is amazing!! I've been hoping you would do something like this for a while, so glad to see this! Looking forward to more
You should invite one of the storror boys to teach you some urban trekking!
cant wait for pt 2!!
That football club that you walked through by the brook, I used to play there and the team I played for still plays there now
21:00 I would guess that's a stormwater tank due to it's close location to that water course. It would have a restricted outlet so that during storms the stream isn't overwhelmed by the increase runoff coming from impermeable surfaces due to development.
The editing on this one is (as always) top notch
Does this guy not wear a watch?
maybe following the border of a country is a nice idea for a new series?
i am so glad he got to the brook after id finished eating my dinner...
*see's Smethwick on the map*  "COME DOWN SMETHWICK YEA, ASK FOR DANNY G. I'LL COME OUT MA HOUSE N BREAK YA FCKIN LEGS" better stay clear of there Tom, i've heard its a bit of a nasty place..
I love all you videos, but as another proud black country boy, this excites me alot. Just seeing Kingswinford on a big you tubers video warms my heart.  If yow ever be in kford me mon, I'll get ya a pint, a cob and a bag of scratchins
umm.... have you ever heard of weils disease???
23:45 "What is that?" That is Walsall's version of a coral reef
The urban adventure is looking exiting too! :P  Sad how much garbage there is around tho.
I'm gonna call them "The Farmer". Ye, I'm tense, waiting for a Farmer to call you out. "Hey you, you can't be there! Come here!"
why is tom running so much? lol
It's nice when he starts uploading a mission he's been threatening for a while and you think "oh good, he didn't die this time"
Just realised that the reason Tom uploads these missions months after he does them is because the statute of limitations on  non-serious criminal cases in the UK is about six months 😄
normal day in britain: Tom: "okay the start is going to be easy, I'm gonna climb a roof and drop into Primark" ... okay  tom
Haha, I bet you smelled great going into that McDonald's
I like how you get dressed for the brambles, but still no gloves.
"that looks like rat central, oh well, lets go through" (30:54)
Can of polish "Dębowe" was there under the fence. Why the fuck would someone export that piss, but I guess it's a good thing, less of it in here.
26:12 The health advice of this man is legendary
"McDonalds, where I can get myself a lovely little disgusting burger"                                                                                                                          (29:30)
british gordan freeman
The game has gotten more exiting, it even has NPC's this time!
Storror would smash this 😅
looks like an abandoned reservoir storage for drinking water. Don't know the area, but that would be my guess for what you were standing on.  Awesome video too :D
No farmers. Feels strange...
that's why Walsall is so nice, it's inhabitants are all NPC's!
This dude is playing life with NPC's this time
Love Walsall to be fair because it reminds me of my childhood doing Ju-Jitsu competitions there representing Ferndown. 👍 Nostalgic
I legit think that in this kind of expedition, a high viz vest with a hard hat would have make you blend in more than camo.
This is even more mental than usual!
I love the content, but please make the aspect ratio better fited for a screen please
Your video and mission are fantastic tom! However, the town looks like grade a shithole 😄
A book rec for people in the comment section: "Access All Areas".
this was super cool can't wait for the next one
can't go a miss with some good old orienteering 👏
Tell you what Tom, don't even worry about editing the videos.  I think I speak for a lot of your fans when I say I'd happily sit and watch hours of this, even if there's not much going on. Just your commentary as you're walking is entertaining enough.
When's the next vid? Love it!
Take a grabber and a bag and claim you are litter picking when caught. You could even do some actual litter picking.
f-IN GET INNN MATEEE
why are you running? do you have a time limit on the challenge?
Why don't you buy construction type clothing for the urban walks. It is as rugged as the army stuff and fits in better with the urban landscape... Oye! what are you doing there mate? Just surveying sir... see my construction type cloths?
can i suggest just wearing a high vis vest noone will question shit
every time I go thorough a bit woodland cant help but think Toms probably do this right now
You Sir are a ducking leg end
Don't you wanna do a mission across Ukraine? We have a diversity of mines and other threats across the forests and fields that's going to make your journey unforgettable))
This is so funny to watch especially because I know the area😂
Brilliant fair play!!
"Eurhh ooo, a bag of dog shit just landed on me"
I'm pretty sure this isn't legal in any way shape or form. But oh well. At least it was entertaining. Especially the parts where he's running past people and 'greeting' them or commenting on the local shops, like the total nutter. That was pretty hilarious.
Tom is goated 🐐
you're turning into ally law
This is so creative. Please more but don't hurt yourself lol
really enjoyable video, thanks
Instant like!
That moment where it cuts from him saying he need to change his clothes, to being in full military gear had me in hysterics.
Me and the misses are from Cannock. We were howling when you said a bag of dogshit landed on you. Too funny
New Subscriber 🍿
*_"I'm wet"_*_ - GeoWizard_
I bursted out laughing "a lovely little disgusting burger"
Urban adventures are the most fun
This is a fantastic video. I've never seen a video that connects so directly with the geography of modern britain.  The straight line videos are fun and they show us the countryside and deliberately very little of where people live. With this video Tom disregards the highways and byways, rules and restrictions that we all obey and as a consequence tears down barriers of the environment where most British people live and work. And by doing so he documents the exact, unpolished version of British urban geography.   No one else is doing this as far as I can see. The video is reminiscent to me of some of the chapters in Professor Alastair Bonnett's brilliant book Off The Map where he explores urban no-man's land.   It's not a relaxing watch and you can almost smell the dog shit and fly tipping, fear the used needles and feel the barriers we construct all around us. But this is how we live.  Great work Tom!
Tom: "What's that fox doing there?" Fox: "Wtf is that human doing here"
20:19 sounded like a gunshot lol had to remind myself this isn’t the U.S.
Love how he's wearing an "Oregon" shirt for his famous bumbling of it's pronunciation in an older video
"Black Country, No Road doesn't exist, it can't hurt you." Black Country, No Road:
love this new type of mission mate! can't wait to see more
Would love to see you do an adventure like this in Newcastle!!
The start looks like you're auditioning for Storrer Tom!😁
I always get a bit worried when I see you whacking through the bramble with your eyes fully exposed. You really ought to look into some safety glasses if you do this again, there are some 3M ones that can be had for about a pound and I think you'd much rather spend a pound than risk losing eyesight in an eye.  Stay safe, love seeing the content!
As always, this was masterfully put together and compelling to watch - loved it!
Up the Saddlers! :)
Seeing this guy in an extreme close-up while he walks through bushes and trash is somehow the best content on YouTube. Keep it up , much love from Spain.
Being from the countryside, I always admired the straight line missions. But the urban side of things always intrigued me. I'm excited to see how this one pans out.
I love how you are using 'How you doin', y'alright' to justify you running like a mad man to the black country locals
Mirror's Edge UK
The bloody confidence you have mate is insane. Keep it up.
When i first watched one of your videos on Geoguesser I had not Idea you had even the slightest of edge, but this here, this is sharp
6:40 storror and geowizard colab ???
I live on Yew Tree, maybe you’ll pass by in part 2 😂
Mirrors Edge 4 was such an underrated game, weird location choice though..
Great video! Would love some more background music like in the straight line missions
I'm a black country native and I loved the bit about the black country dialect, I use so many of those words in my day to day speak and it's just funny seeing them written down
I love when he converses his brummy accent is so strong
The moving tracker map with your face on it was great!! nice new touch!👍
This might honestly be my favorite of all the missions, the vibe is more chill, yet the mission itself seems just as (if not more) treacherous than the straight line missions
I can smell this video
insanity
Tom, for missions like these you need a tactical high vis jacket, with something like Cadent or BT on. Most people wont question you if youre in areas that arent publically accessible.
nice bc,nr reference hahah
Holy sht, you are not minding your eyeballs. Put your hood on both your forearms forward similar like boxers do (or at least one horizontally) when going through vegetation to protect your face (did my fair share of wild woods back in the days).  You don't want to get branches away you with you palms, they'll snap back and you'd get yourself a nice eyepatch one day. You want to clamp down and wade through them with your body so they graze cloth protected sides, not the face and be off.
I hope the type of person to through a plastic bag full of shit into the woods gets a bag of shit thrown into their window.
i got out of breath from watching this
Tom, future trip check out Brave Dave's Big Fat Freight Hop - Part 1, and anything  from Shiey for train hopping adventures.
Love the new idea! Can't wait for the next one!
Anyone wonders why it is in 4:3 aspect ratio ?
Aah, another video of casually trespassing, breaking the law and making money from it on youtube. Calling it "obstacles" doesn't make it less stupid, still dont get the popularity....
is this a black country new road reference?
You've outdone yourself again Tom
Tom's gone mad 😂
I love this, it's an exact idea that I've had before. I live on the outskirts of a city in Sweden and untill recently I could walk through a small forest in my backyard and through a bunch of patches of small woods into the huge wild forests of Sweden. But now they have built a couple of new residential areas which makes it impossible to do that anymore. I've found a way that leads me to only cross 2 roads but still makes me sad that we are destroying so much of nature. Keep up the interesting content with creative ideas!
“It’s not a road. You’re wrong. It’s not a road. I make the rules on this channel.”  God love ya, Tom 🤣 Great vibes all around on this video
Bringing back memories of exploring down the creek as a kiddo
These challenges would be a whole lot easier if you were wearing a orange reflective jacket like construction workers. People would probably just assume you’re with storm and water
Such a good episode!! I especially loved when you ran through the mall and went into the McDonald’s. I got a taste of Walsall!
When you said you didn’t want stuff in your bloodstream and then continued to get in the sewage stream
I did not expect this to be this entertaining! The chill atmosphere is a welcome change to the existing format.
When is the GeoWizard, Storror cross-over happening?
You should have worn a hi visibility vest
Certainly the most risky mission idea you’ve ever done, but yet again an incredible idea; unbelievably entertaining and the editing is absolutely on point!
no way id go anywhere near that level of vegetation here in australia. id be neck deep in spiders and snakes within seconds. walking on established trails in the bush is fine, diving into waist deep vegetation where you cant even see the bottom is another.
Dude should just wear a high vis jacket and hard hat. He'd be left alone.
Mate, a carpark contains roads.
You should involve Storror somehow in one of these missions!
I love that these are one of those rare videos that actually nicely fills up my iPad Pro screen because of the unusual aspect ratio
8:40 I’m pretty sure he ran past professor X from the X-men.  I’m surprised Geo Wizard wasn’t recruited for his super human geography skills!
You should just wear a high visibility yellow vest, carry a rake and bucket, and have an id with your picture on it. Don't think anyone will question it.
This channel is Youtube gold these missions are the best.
100% keep up these kind of new adventures! I love this type of real world challenge content, like the straight line missions.
thank you for the subtitles I needed them at times.
I love these videos, but why is the aspect ratio like this?
Really interesting, urban exploring is always entertaining
It feel really weird watching you not walk in a straight line. I love this new concept tho!
as a American its crazy to see how popular Mc Ds is over the pond. I dont recall the last time Ill ever seen anyone outside of one unless its a group of teens being cool.
This video is a future British YouTube classic
Im sorry but this is a road 10:00
Yes Tom!!
More Battle Royale please!!! :)
She had Billie Eilish Style
I pressed like already while watching the ad before the video.
27:03 nasi tu byli
As if he thought the dugout on the football pitch was a stand for fans 😂 bless you Tom that made me laugh
“Babe wake up. Tom uploaded another video of him doing weird shit again”
The UK is so depressing. Trash and crap everywhere.
100% car parks count as roads
You’ll get yourself arrested at this rate.
This guy keeps bettering his terrible ideas with even worse ones
Parkour, Parkour!!
I'M MORE THAN ADEQUATE, LEAVE ROADS OUT OF THIS!!!
Why don't they get the young offenders and prisoners to clean up this shit? Our local Councils are the biggest thieves on the planet. They receive Billions and do fuck all with it. WHERE ARE THE COUNCIL WORKERS KEEPING THINGS CLEAN? The Councils are run by lazy fat-arsed self-serving jobsworth, middle-aged losers, who only care about themselves and getting their monthly salary.
I understand the point in the camo but litterly anywhere iv been seen or iv seen you been caught you would have been better off in "everyday clothes". Caught in camo people expect things. Caught in a tracksuit people expect lost 😂👌 true stories.
Of all the things to land on me, that wasn't the one I wanted!
I feel like parkour training and a small amount of climbing gear would have been useful here. Just a T-shirt and trainers is a bit under prepared.
This is GOLD! Get in ! one thing that could help you move through restricted areas is a "maintenance vest".. so if someone see you at a distance, they may don't even bother to check if you have permission to walk in a restricted place!
As somebody who was born in Walsall and lived in the area my entire life, this is amazing to see, can't wait for more!
Mission across the Midlands without getting stabbed
Walking across the black country is more dangerous than when you walked through that bog in norway
Class
Please Tom, you gotta change the video format, it’s too square. Other than that don’t change anything, this adventure was loads of fun to watch!
Beard: ✔️ Camo: ✔️ GPS(looks like a detonator): ✔️ Running in the city centre: ✔️  Ladies & Gentlemen.... We Got Him!
This felt a lot like City 17.
The 'smallest capacity stand' you've ever seen was the dugout for the home team. The away teams' dugout is next to it, but no roof cause har har
wow, this looks like a tv show from 1990. :) Love it!
This is great man, keep it up!
absolutely love it Tom! Great content as usuak
Verity looks like she's lost quite a bit of weight. Good for her.
Amazing! Miss the voice over though
For urban missions u could wear trade-mans workwear as you could blend in more. If u wore like work trousers they’ve got loads of pockets for stuff and can put knee pads and stuff in them too
amazing
17:39 He loves brambles just about as much as he loves wearing gloves.
This video was sponsored by Visit Wonderful Walsall.
Was that a clip of gary powndland I saw at the start? Legend!
Mad to see such a big YouTuber recording close by my home cuz I live in an estate right next to bescot and I’m always going to that McDonald’s and retail park lmao
Now that kids no longer explore the nooks & crannies of our land, our soldiers are no longer familiar with them, so that in the event of an invasion, the home-field advantage is lessened.
This 100% reminds me of the video game "Mirror's Edge".
Ah England
These mission are fantastic, cannot wait for the next episode!
Sometimes I wish the industrial revolution never happened. But here we are. Great.
Absolutely love it! Haven’t seen all episodes of Black Country Mission yet, but already hope that you will do more urban missions in the future!
Stalker into the Forbidden Zone...
for a christmas present a few years ago I got a present to go to dudley zoo and actually go in and feed the animals it was great fun
I'll watch whatever you make, but this is just magnificent! Hats off to you Tom!
That fish probably had 3 heads and glows in the dark!
Just out of interest does anyone know why the videos are in 4:3 (the old fashioned ‘square’ video)when GoPros can film like 16:9(the normal film and screen size)
Your brummy accent seems to go up a few notches when talking to the locals lol
Really should have thought about supplies a tad bit more, should have had extra socks, water, and a blade.
INSTANT CLASSIC.
Chicken Nuggets Here We Come
Love the flamboyancy in this video😂😂
Tom fights The Sorrow 24:18
Commenting before I watch, Lower Gornal resident here, I can’t wait!
Sick of beautiful countryside of Wales, Scotland or Norway? Do no-road challenge in industrial area :D
I've also always been fascinated by these kind of sh!tholes. I've long admired the Black Country, in particular, for the dump this area is. Few places on this planet can rival the sheer dereliction of Corby - where I've been cataloguing a photographic memoire of various filthy locations for 23 years.
Bro It really bothered me that you didn’t have any eye protection going ghtpugh all those brambles. Please consider wearing clear saftey glasses on future missions. Was a very enjoyable video otherwise.
At this rate feel like you’ll stumble apon a dead body or something goodness or serial killer oooo
Wait but can u cross roads then?? U did wtf
32:13
the way you climbed over all those buildings was like a hidden path in a video game also Greggs cameo, 10/10 video
Isn’t the brook you refer to in fact the river Tame?
From someone who lives in Oregon I liked seeing you cherish that yellow shirt. Is there a story behind it?
You should have worn a high viz jacket and then just casually walked the bits through Primark, nobody would have suspected you
Alternate title: Tom goes to McDonald's
“In Birmingham, now, there’s more miles of canals than there is rats.” -Stewart Lee
Why exactly did you run through the shopping centres at the start? You had done nothing wrong and had no reason to escape the area!
Cross one Island in a .....
The little nooks and crannies of British towns are like cracks in the system, places proving that the all-encompassing concrete commercial regime isn't quite as monolithic as we think. That's why they're so exciting and comfy, to me anyway.
If anyone reads this, Storror army should get Storror to do this challenge.
Walsall's not in the Black Country mush.
These comments will likely not been seen by many people but i feel i just cant leave without saying how much i love these vids and series. by far the best vids on youtube and should get a deal with netflix. best shit ever. big love
for the love of god please put gloves on
Constantly worried that you were going to pierce your foot on a spiike!!
This is actually quite a coincidence. Inspired by your straight-line missions I decided to walk around the island I live on following the shore as well as I could. After six hard days on the road I finished where I started. Later I started to plan for new challenges and one of my ideas was to walk to my grandparents place while not using roads. That mission is still being planned though. It's funny how I plan a mission and then later on you show up and do one using the same rules.
typo in disclaimer
one big dump
Maybe if there's future urban missions, throwing on a lightweight hi-vis for work yards, back area's,  loading docks etc could be a good idea. People are going to be much less likely to question you wandering through one of those area's in a hi-vis, unless they've actively seen you hop a fence, camera may be a bit conspicious though haha.
Tom: I need to move fast because I'm on schedule... Also Tom, just 10 secs later: *stops to just talk for 5 minutes*
I wanna watch this but I can't deal with the aspect ratio
12:42 - Me: No worries Tom. I don't have a spikey fence at home.
very enjoyable use of 'cretinous' in the sign off :D
Unsubbed, I joined for the Geoguessr content, and it's getting less and less since 6mt in preparation for the Wales thing.
DUDLEYYYY, THATS MY HOMETOWN WHAT A SHITHOLE 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Can't wait for this one! - I can literally see Dudley Castle from my Bedroom window.
gosh, these are always so incredibly exciting
Just lovely
I’m so used to the straight line missions that I’m always worried for some seconds when he turns left or right - until I realize that it’s no problem this time
I like how to communicate with the locals you go "deep" black country, then back to your "lighter" black country accent
This reminds me of David Choe's hitchhiking series a bit 😀 love it
This is interesting change of pace but I kinda miss your voiceover throughout the videos and also miss the straight line mission style editing where future tom explains the map with 16-bit soundtrack in the background.
love the Oregon shirt, that's where I live. Have you been Tom??
UK looks so cool. Great country
Proposed metrics for making this a regular challenge and scoring results.  (In order of priority) - Distance traveled along a road  - Number of road crossings - [Straight line distance / actual distance traveled] (helps emulate the straight line challenges)    -- OR [time of trip/ straight line distance] (encourages short routes as well as easier faster routes)  The goal in all metrics is the lowest score possible.  Thoughts?
Great, we are a Parkour channel now...
Another great video!
Hey cool reference in the thumbnail
Another amazing adventure! Great idea, interesting to see urban environment from a different angle. Good luck! Waiting for more!
I will watch 1000 of these man, great content!
Tom you should try out the Dji action 2 as a substitute for your current setup
i will from now on worship you as a mighty god for that BCNR reference.
These missions are so interesting and compelling. Making an adventure in the most mundane of environments.👍
so good!!
This is so pointless... I love it.
Such an interesting enviroment to do this challenge in! I really look forward to these missions :) Really appreciate the little map in the corner of the video, hope this stays for future missions!
I feel like you should have some safety glasses as well as gloves when going through all the thorns and brambles. Not fearing a stick in your eye is a great thing.
How about you call it no pavement mission.
Minimap is key
You should check out the band Black Country new road lol
“A little junkie camp” hahaha
I don’t know why, but the risk of you getting caught by security stresses me out. I’m such a conformist.
Hahaha oh man I think this is the best one yet. Thank you so much for suffering for our light entertainment Tom.   Minor criticism: what happened to the wholesome 90s video game soundtrack?!
am ya
Heroin apparatus
Loved this new style of video. It complements the straight line missions really well.
👌
8:39 is a true case of accidental renaissance, just like that infamous New Year in Manchester photo.
More entertaining than any nights Cape video ever released
"We have Storror at home."
32:46 Some Mansfield Town guys out in the wild
Seeing this POV makes me realise how much Tom sounds like Drew from Storror
Tom in Walsall! What a delight, gew on kidda
That was just rank, not quite the same as the straight-line missions 🤢
algorithm gang
Amazing! Never stop, Tom, never stop.
SHould go with a hi-vis vest! People dont look twice then!
if only you had the exact same clothes but in black or something it would've been so different
Tom "Yeahyeah" Davies
Only watched 5 mins and already so hooked!
Man these videos give me flashbacks to things I've never even done.
Cool
Isn't it ironic how people who have dogs wants to look so proper and caring, so they pick up the turds.. then wrap it in non-degradable plastic and throw it into the bushes when no one is looking.  If they just left it, even how stigmatized that is, it would be gone in a few days or weeks.. instead of "never". Or you know, just throw it in a bin, it's not rocket science...
saw u uploaded and suddenly my holidays have a purpose again
Bristol to Bath? ;)
Tom its April, It was snowing last week, Its not summer :(
That was fun viewing, thanks for putting yourself through that, lol!
walk from sunderland to newcastle!
Fucking amazing that your going on a new adventure Tom, can't wait to see the other episodes!
Proposal for the rules of this magnificent challenge: everything can be used as long as it doesn’t have an official name to to it. Every street and most paths have names but most of what you are aiming for doesn’t. Its  clear, straight forward and easy to check.
Lovely content
Christmas came early, again!
Great to see this content again
I find this urban mission funnier than the straight line mission. It's like getting chased by an angry farmer every five minutes. And also all those disgusting things that you found is definitely an icing on the cake
You mentioned that following the canals would be a bit boring… but not for me. Yes, it doesn’t hit the adventuring spirit you look for, but I’d absolutely watch you stroll through a “guided” hike
Back Country, No Road
Nice play on words there. Are you a fan of the Band?
Absolutely love this concept! There's something weirdly nice about exploring little pockets of nature and hidden locations of urban environments. Can't wait for more!
This man will break the internet.
being a black country local this is ace
20 advertisements later I have arrived at the end of the video lol
I love how you care what workers or security guards might do.. No one cares. Just do it!
stunning work sir. and I'm only 1 minute 15 in
Im British and have never even heard of that place. it must be a serious shit hole
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait to next week for episode 2 😭 lol. This man's adventures are the best content on YouTube 👍🤜
STOROR colab ?
add a pair of secateurs to your kit will help with some of the brambles
I love you putting on the accent every time you spoke to people
He really needs to do this with a high viz jacket and a white helmet both for his own safety and for people to think that he's an inspector.  Just have a clipboard that he can pull out if anyone suspicious comes by.
Luv a bit of classic GeoWizard! Good on ya cock!
Excellent!
Just brilliant! Thank you!!
So happy to see GW is BACK!!
Should you be worrying about the landmines, its kinda scary now that i think about it.
Really loved the video and all hard work 👍 Also into filming similar projects and just wonder if is good enough for a beginner https://youtu.be/xKv0T4GUAM8 Please, you all invited to check it out and help emerging channel as we put lots of work and time and passion , thank you (link to our latest video above) Thanks for inspiration  b
wouldn't it be stunning if Tom knew BN,CR the band?
Tipton born and bred! Checking in.
17:21 coolant, Tom. Smells like old, bad fish :) Also, did you film this almost a year ago?
The comedy element of this for anyone from the Black Country area is sensational. Can't wait for part 2
Little Britain!
cool idea!
I dare say a man that just came out of the sewers was not the most disgusting thing in that McDonald's.
You went through the tunnel underneath⁉️Never been more proud.
Quite frankly one of the absolute best channels on Youtube. Love these adventures!
id rather see rural exploring videos but i enjoyed this video aswell
Amazing
Tom feels like a personal friend by this point. GET IN! buddy
Should do a collab with Bear Grylls on this one.
GeoWizard: Fucking hell kid... Lol
id love to do a walk like that. recon you should walk in a straight line through Amsterdam ;)
mirrors edge
This reminds me a lot of vagrant holiday
Now do it again but in a straight line.
"this looks alright"  two seconds later...  "this is a literal junkie camp"
Setting off in a t-shirt and trainers, I'm already worried.
18th on trending here in the UK atm (13:56 BST, 18/04/2022)
"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."
ramps in parking lots are private land and therefore not a road
The amount of trash there is sad
i mean the canal video wouldn't be as boring as you think, atleast as a Q&A video
There was absolutely no reason to tread in the brook :') Just use the horizontal parts of the fence and climb to the other side
I hope you got your tetanus jabs after this. Wading through sludge-filled drainage pipes and traipsing through junkie dens does not seem healthy.
Such a good idea to go through a stinky drain pipe! I love the content!
I really enjoy the editing, especially the little map. But why was he running at the start?
What an absoluteeee shit hole. You should come to cornwall, everywhere else in England is a shit pit.
Man how haven't you at least encountered ONE junkie in your travels??
After seeing you traverse a town in this way, I really wanna see a collab with you and STORROR so they can teach you some basic parkour techniques for getting around and over buildings easier lol
I love the way Tom goes full Walsall whenever he runs into another human being 😂
it's actually so depressing how much rubbish there is everywhere
I just now realized why these videos come out 6 months after the deed. Cause of the statue of limitations on trespassing. I don’t know why I hadn’t realized this before 😂
I know the UK has been going back in time because of the brexit but that doesn't mean the rest of the world should suffer to watch these square videos
So that's what parkour is like if you take all the fun bits out.
Nice challenge, but Verity is the real MVP here. How does she take all these challenges... She's a keeper!
can't wait for the "Only Roads Mission" 🤣🤣🤣
Looking for a good mission, which will get a lot of views, and be a great experience?   Look up "Megatron" in Sheffield it's a series of huge tunnels that go under Sheffield city center. just need to go when rain has not just been/is not forecast
"this is not good..." Deboonked! This is in fact top quality content! <3
Stop the idling and do Wales! :)
I wasn't sold on this at the start but at the end I found it brilliant. It doesn't have a strict structure like the straight line missions and is more open to adventure. Although you haven't painted the black country in a good light!!
There he is again, the bloke we'd even watch attempting to cross an ocean in completely straight line...
cool idea but man what a shithole, I prefer the challenges to be natural that looks great to spend time, not piles of used needles
As a yamyam, it's a shame this will end at Dudley Zoo, would be great to see you going further south of there, might even go through some more familiar stuff for me.
"dya know what I just saw a fish imma go for it" had me dying
Wonder what people think as they drive by and see a fully camo clad man climbing out of the bushes
Wow, the attention to detail syncing the subscribe card and the patreon link card to the rhythm of the music at the end is next-level!
Honestly this was really cool to see as someone from the states. It makes sense that they do - but I didn't know that England had the same not-quite-urban/not-quite-rural strip mall/shopping districts like we do in the US. All we see of England in media is idyllic countryside, villages of 100 people with picturesque houses and gardens and pubs older than our country, and London. Until this video I could never picture big parking lots and chain stores, there's a passive assumption that the only two settings are "tiny village" and "city".
the black country: new road reference is making me giggle. I'm excited to see how this goes
That "Little Britain"-style intro lmao 😂 - Brilliant! The only thing that's missing is "Oooh, Black Country... I love you!" 😁.
As a fellow yam yam, this was essentially injecting serotonin into my veins. Just hearing so many yam yam accents and so much slang, and also seeing so many places and going "I know where that is!!" with the energy of an overexcited toddler.
I have proof this is faked and it was actually filmed in Iceland. just look at 11:05
You should contact Storror! They'd probably be up for a challange like this one.
You crossed a road.
You are a legend Tom!
nice
Have you not got any ticks over on the British Isles? Most people would've gotten Lyme disease a hundred times over from that, good work
soon we'll see a storror geowizard collab lol
This is undervalued social commentary.
Next episode: Attempting to cross the Pentagon in a straight line
"But as I was saying. Yeah, I'm wet. I'm really wet." 😆
What is with all the litter? Every city has garbage lying around but how does a shopping cart get into a bush, behind a series of fences within an isolated area?
why is he jogging ? xD
I swear i would even watch you walking on a treadmill
"black country, no road" Genius.
black country, no road is hilarious
8:37 - "How is everyone doing? Alright, alright, alright, alright ..." Gee, Tom is not only entertaining in his videos, but also in real life.  The look on those faces, haha.
Running through Walsall like that you know everyone thought you were a shop lifter running from security.
How about crossing a city while avoiding roads entirely? Surely you could find footbridges, tunnels, train tracks etc. to make this possible, potentially. You may need to look through a few cities to find one that this would be doable in, similar to what you do to select countries for the straight line missioning.
MORE ! MORE!
"Ellow! Ya royte?"
I'd love to see you attempt to travel the furthest distance without anything. Start with absolute basics and no money. Hitchhike, hop trains, etc. Track the number of miles you've travelled with no resources.
He had geowizard style, going to Dudley for a while
Super fun video! I’m hooked
great vid mate
I'd love to see at least an 80% increase in "Hows it goin? Yawright?" to strangers as you jog about
just a tip, if attempting this kind of thing again, wear a hi vis vest. you'd probably be best wearing some black army surplus combat trousers and some boots too. wearing casual clothes like that just makes you look like you're trying to rob places 😂
Not recommending kids to climb spiked fences is a bit of an understatement. Spiked fences are not for cosmetic reasons. Those spikes are supposed to impale you if you slip, most of the time catching your upper body or head. Alot of people have seriously injured themselves cause they look like scalable, it can be deadly, Ive seen it be deadly.
Holy shite don’t go in the brook…
My man's doing parkour now
Wowie
This is quality! Even better when you live in the Black Country🤣 love the thumbnail mucka - “Dudley Zoo”😂
i never thought i would find a youtuber as funny and interesting to watch as you tom Excellent content as always 😊😊
Would be crazy if the adventure ends in 5 minutes because fucking Primark isn't open haha
A high-vis and dried muddy boots will gain you access to virtually anywhere
It looked like ya just nicked something the way you were running through those shop in the beginning 😂
This content is criminally underrated.
Great video as always Mr Bernardo Silva 👍
The "Think i'll have some chicken nuggets and be on my way i think... Cock?" Made me giggle.
That's not a stand... that's a dugout!
bro how do you just... say hi to people that you dont know... when you look incredibly suspicious running through a shopping centre
10/10 content Tom, fucking love it
These are amazing! we're so blessed to have Tom gracing our screens
Where we're going... we don't need roads
i appreciate the uk post punk name pun, intended or not
all the blue paint looks like something out of mirrors edge
she had tom davies style
it looks like so much fun actually
Mate when the bag of dog shit landed on you and you screamed I was in tears 😂 love your content very original stuff, keep it up
Great stuff, love this new series!
Love this content thanks Tom 👍
it is so exciting to watch your path
love this new format Tom!!! keep going strong my dude
Up the yam yams
It is all good and dandy - but why do you shoot your adventure videos in 4:3 resolution, instead of 16:9, you surely don't think that we got 80's TV's :)
what would you do without Verity, treasure her
I like this more than the straight line.
This mission is kind of weird tbh but great to see more content.  Also, damn UK cities can be real ugly man 😅 what industrialization does to a mf
Is that thumbnail title supposed to be a dry black country new road pun?
SOME OF THE FEATS CARRIED OUT IN THIS SERIES AND DANGEROUS
Dangers of Wales : Angry Welsh farmers Dangers of West Midlands : STDs
“I make the rules on this channel”-tom 2022
Seriously hoping you don't get tetanus from any of those rogue needles 🤞
I’ve been watching since your first Wales video man. Amazing. Would love to go on an adventure like this, it’s been way too long.
You're such a legend
There should really be a collab between you and STORROR
Why do allthe fences look the same lol?
"Can I just say yet again that I'm very experienced at climbing spikey fences and such obsticles. Please don't try this at home."   My home hasn't got these spikey fences and such obsticles you talk of, so I would therefore be leaving my home to get to any. Does this mean I can climb them?  Why am I even asking you, I'm an adult! Come see my impaled corpse on the 9'oclock news later.
The video quality is so high now!
The first ten minutes almost felt like an Ally Law video. lmao.
Your are nuts, mate! haha
This actually reminds me of my childhood when we followed the stream through our village as long as possible without deviating more than 3 m to either side. Great memories! Thank you for that and the great entertainment on top 😊
At the start I was gonna suggest you should have contacted the Storror boys for a colab going over roofs and carparks. But although they do love a water challenge I'm not sure they would be into that bramble mess
There's no way he came out of that stream without several STDs
i only read the title and i already know that this is gonna be fuckin awesome
Sure the entire area is full of decay, pollution, desolation and misery but you have to weigh that against a few people making a lot of money for themselves.
Im from walsall, this is so funny
The line missions were crazy specific to certain locations... You could literally do this in any town or city that you like and it will be entertaining!
When was this shot? It's too hot to be recent right?
But I got one question: Why 4:3?
Funny how you just ran through 3 shopping centers but have seemingly no way of replacing that tee.
great use of little brittiain theme
British fences are so scary omg
Love it, keep up the great work and stay safe! <3
"Its Primark I'm really worried about now" The words of every child when they get taken shopping with their mum
Edgelands adventurising - I like it! Have you created something new? Venturing on the line between rural and urban areas…
High-vis jacket and a hard hat next time. Easy mode!
Thank you, enjoyed to a great extend! Honestly, I dread ever living there, seems horrible on multiple fronts. Breaks my heart to see people & city in such a state.
You should go on an adventure together with Verity
Yeah I agree, if roads in car parks are roads, then by analogy, isles in shopping centers are roads too, because they both do the same thing. I think a road has to take you somewhere to count as a road, just like the paths along the canals take you somewhere, so they're also restricted even though they're not roads!
I am invincible in this camo jacket, I am Ray Mears, I am the Jack of Hearts
Bostin..., my family (on mums side) are Black Country folk,  proper "peaky blinder" bargees from way back. (Not often spoke about tho) Got loads of uncles and aunts who use Black Country dialect, our kidder..  I was born in Queen Elizabeths Hospital on the Hagley Rd.  Mum comes from Smethwick/Oldbury  we lived in Tipton and Coseley  and at the bottom of our garden was a huge hole in the ground, I can't remember what we called it - maybe "the tip" - I'm old - no 'health and safety then we played in it all day - even though I was 4 or 5 I can remember the rag and bone men coming around on a horse and cart and the butcher's van delivering, he always gave me a slice of Black Pudding if I was waiting on the gate - I must've been 4 or 5. So nice to see you going through the Black Country and skirting Coesely and Tipton..  Me? Ive been outta there a long time, first to the Brummie Rivera of  Weston-Super-Mare where I was mainly bought up and now as an old fart a zillion miles away from the Black Country in China. Enjoy your videos immensely (and your accent)
Great content, and great to see a different side to the black country 👍
Very well done minimap kid!
i mean you definitely did go on a couple roads tho
He sounds like a goofy gordon ramsay
Loved this! Not going to lie, I would rather do a wales trip compared to this one 😂😂
“That looks like rat central, oh well let’s go through” 😂
beautiful! I still reallyu would like a straight line mission in england xD or atleast an atempt. I understand the issues with the bigger roads. Anyway this new series im looking forward to, sofar so good!
The "no roads mission" is a brilliant concept -- combining urban exploration and straight line missions. Looking forward to more. I suggest wearing more appropriate urban attire though; walking around in full camo in the summer in the city isn't exactly discreet.
I’m curious, what day of the week did you do this? Great video!!
10:56 – No spare t-shirt? No less-conspicuous jacket in non-camouflage colours? Shame you're not near a shopping centre with a bunch of cheap clothing shops then huh... 😂
This is grim as hell. And, what a great mission! I have seen you had someone 'spotting' you on the shopping centre roof...or have I? In the glass reflection, a scary-looking backpack-wearing hooded person at 6:11.
You could define a road as having a street name.
11:04 *Dons full military technical gear* "And on we go, down past the bingo hall..."
Another home run. Next a mission to just find most disgusting places people wouldn't go and how you walk thru there
I understand that you are running when you are somewhere you aren't supposed to be but why are you running inside the mall and up sthe stairs?  Did I miss something about the mission being timed? Or are you just too fit to walk?  Edit: nevermind you mention it is timed later
Sadly, I don't have any spikey fences at home to try climbing over
I have never been in England. Is this a good video to study how people are living there?
You know you're in for a treat when the video starts with a disclaimer. Can't wait for part 2!
This honestly seems less desirable to do than the straight line missions to me...
when Tom and Verity get married   Walking down the aisle in a straight line challenge
Awesome well done sir
MacDonalds v McDonalds. which r u??
Trespassing:  Geography edition
'it's primark im worried about now' - topshop circa 2019
so stoked for a new mission
Eye protection is a good call too tbh
Oh my God this channel is pure adventure and quality content
I love how the closed captions keep confusing Walsall with Warsaw. I’m pretty certain that’s the biggest compliment ever received by the former, and the most hurtful insult ever dealt to the latter.
Typo in opening warning screen: ARE* DANGEROUS...
"how to find dead bodies" [PART 1]
Wass 9:59 not a road?
You need a pair of Vessi shoes mate.
I love this type of content man. Reason why I love this channel.
That “Cock” explainer was perfect. Can’t wait for part two.
Roads are lava XD
Wow, didn't expect another adventure from you for a while, very well done and truly entertaining. Can't wait for part 2.
He is giving off main character energy, treating everyone like NPC’s 😂
The ratio fits perfect on the Fold, thanks for future proofing this vid Tom
I thought by "Black country" he meant a country in Africa 💀💀💀
comming out strong with the mirrors edge gameplay
I'm glad Verity is around to keep it all sane.
you know you'd look a lot less suspicious if you weren't wearing camo. it really doesn't hide you at all in the brush.
As a native Oregonian, I love the Oregon shirt!!
This really does just exemplify how utterly disgusting urban environments are. A veneer of cleanliness on top of a literal rubbish dump.
*GeoWizard Walking Missions: "It's fun because it's not illegal trespassing"* (...probably.)
I feel like the military style camo is a poor choice in my opinion. Olive and khaki coloured hunters clothing would provide all the same pocket and protection (from bramble and the like) options, as well as 90% of the camouflage. And you look less like a terrorist....which is a bonus.
This new Mirrors Edge game looks so realistic!
I don't need you to confirm or deny, but speaking as an aquatic scientist, I really hope you plugged every single orifice before you got in that water...
Super interesting video, mate. Cheers from Germany.
I’d be running out of Walsall as well tbh
The intro was great. Love the idea
The urban stuff is my favourite! dangerous though but awesome because it’s more relatable and interesting going in places we all think about going but never do
OMG waking up to another adventure is absoluitely amazing, made me so happy to see this
Black Country words. Of all of them you mentioned, you somehow didn’t mention bab…
I could never do this. The chance of encountering spiders would kill me
Didn’t expect going from ‘Countryside Tom’ to ‘Parkour Tom’
Surrounded by old heroin stuff "I wonder why this area is so fortified" I think the answer is kinda obvious lol. They gotta try and keep the junkies out.  On another note I have never seen those little spoon things before and that took me down a rabbit hole of needle exchanges and learning that people shootup cocaine that they dissolve in citric acid and vitamin c which just sounds insane to me.
I used to live in the background for 16 years. I got really excited when I saw places I recognised haha, can't wait for more.
lol wearing jeans, regardless its great content
Indiana Jones of the Urban Lands
Tom I'm 99% sure security were sat on their arse not giving a shit (maybe they were having one).
Seems like if a robber just films himself, talking to himself no ones gonna bat an eye he's running from coppers.
Would be sick to see Storror attempt this challenge
Stellar content mate, 10/10 <3
I’m always astonished at how you go through the rustiest, most putrid water without freaking out like I do 😭
Great content!
Love the Black Country, New Road reference in the thumbnail, haha. If it is even intentional :D
Oh damn this is going to be so fun!
So excited for this series. Geowizard + urban exploration is great.
Surprised you still had an appetite to eat at Macca’s after all that.
Commenting for engagement cuz this needs attention
Thank you Thomas. It's a great distraction from my everyday duties. *Thank you.*
I live down the road from the Zoo… Man wish had known.  Damn Monopoly on McDonalds, this was a while ago then.
I was expecting a collab with the band Black Country, New Road
I love this idea for a video! Definitely a nice turn on your traditional expedition videos. I love the urban and lots of abandoned aesthetic to it.   Also, is the Black Country like the south of the UK? 😂
This is straight up MTV content
Great video
This is so brilliant mate
Shit! If it isn't dogshit it's sheepshit mate! Next time, put on a dodgy prisoners outfit and run along the streets from point A to point B without "getting caught" ;D. If you have to stop and explain, you lose. If that isn't difficult enough, put on a pink jumpsuit and a long blond wig with bangs. XD
Next time wear a high vis jacket and pretend like you're supposed to be there, might help you with your anxiety levels haha
Tom, you’ve officially gone mad and I’m here for it
Why the hell did you run for the first 10 minutes of the video
Good lord, this was disgusting lol amazing freaking content
Ah, it's nice to see someone who travels off the beaten path.
great video you're one of my favorite youtubers, love the real life routes and paths you choose
Absolute mad lad. Got me giggling like a kookaburra.
I feel like I'm watching Shiey. This is great keep it up.
Thank you for exposing us to some awesome environments. Love the cheeky upsides of the urban world.
oh boy don't you just love the contemporary experimental rock outfit black country, no roads
The Shackleton of our times.
I have an interesting idea, what about a follow the coast line trip around wales or something? That might be just difficult and interesting enough. Make some distance like 2km max from water and follow it
his next series: crossing military base in a straight line without getting shot at pt 1
Guys I think he's gone insane
"Dogshit" yeah, sure, besides a brown water filled bucket lmao
made my day 10 times better thank you.
was waiting for this videos only
Thanks for 4:3, really nice to watch with an IPad
Didnt know this was going to be a Storror video 😆
“Anyone who sees me will probably think I’m a mad man, and I very well may be.”
No roads? But you crossed a road
Really need a hi viz best and a clipboard
i like your oh reagan shirt
I bet it was nice not having to worry about a line
beautiful as always, thank you tom.
Couldn’t do this in Australia 🇦🇺 you would have snakes and spiders hanging off u!
Black Country, No Road is gonna be the hottest new geography themed band
This was really fun! Looking forward to the next parts
This video series is sick, really good video!
gross
im here or it
He mentioned it being Summer, does this mean it was actually before the Mission Across Wales?  Didn't expect to see it now if that is the case, but glad it didn't get discarded, because it is really interesting.
came for weird adventure, stayed for "Get in!!"
I know this is said a lot but this is seriously some of the best content I’ve ever watched on YouTube.
Tremble, parkour video makers!!
Absolutely loving the Oregon shirt
that structure around 20min could possibly be a bunker, but I could be wrong I am pretty retarded
Now you need to get an urban camo lol.
Verity is amazingly supportive.
how does bro know what a heroin "apaerotis" look like?
either this dudes a scitza[hrenic or british peple are overthinkers. probs the 2nd
True to the core of the term "urban exploration"
Best content on the internet.  Thanks, Tom!
All those NPCs standing there "doing shopping" while white CJ is just running through the entire map
It took all of 200 meters for Tom to get stuck on the planned route and needing an alternative way of progressing.  I have a feeling this will be good.
You would make for a great surveyor Tom
Something to consider for the next mission; in the Urban Environment, overalls, a high vis vest and a hard hat might offer better camoflauge. You're less likely to get challenged if security or a worker spots you.
the Black Country, New Road refference made me smile
Tom confirmed BCNR fan?
Black Country, No Road
Black Country, No Road
Black Country, No Road is my favourite post punk band
Ah I see British post-industrial hellscapes aren’t much different than Canadian post-industrial hellscapes. It’s fun to have things in common.
wow Tom has become an urbexer this is mad
You seem to know a lot about heroin
Straight line across the Ukraine when?
A road is something that the city or county has to maintain. If it’s private, it’s fair game.
There’s something about you running in the mall that made me laugh so much 😂
Needs more Verity... only kidding. These videos are the best thing on YouTube.
Another banger adventure! Love it and can't wait for the next installment.
I am entertained
More
In my own city I've done a sort of mission of my own, to make a "circle" that passes through every neighborhood without passing by the same point twice, without plotting it out beforehand and mostly making up the route as you go. Since I did that by bike, I stayed on roads and in alleyways. This is almost like the opposite of that. I wonder if it's possible to pass through my city without going down a road.
You should cross the Isthmus of Catanzaro on  foot, it’s 40km iirc
Crazy how many fences there is over there...
do this in a straight line you coward!
this might be the most random video i’ve ever watched
Didn't bring a spare T shirt. If only there was a local establishment with clothing for sale...
2 minutes in thought I wasn't gonna like this mission concept... now here I am 10 mins in hoping he makes this a new series. Your content creation is just too good Tom...
legend
Now that's a mission I can get behind. Entertainment after my fashion :) I was skeptical when I saw the title at first but I forgot whom I was watching. Of course this was gonna be entertaining. And it is! Looking forward to the next episode.
When he said Rodney I lost it
Geowizard: This is the black country  Guilty Americans: 👀👀
u lost the plot m8?
please marry veridy
should wear  a hi-vis next time no one with question you
Tom is the lost camper from Shaun the Sheep lmao
Tom ran around in that shopping mall like he was playing GTA
Loved this adventure, Tom. Being from Wolverhampton, took me back to the good old days as a kid, exploring the canals and abandoned industrial parks of the Black Country. What a shit hole.
Is it just me, or does this series deserve its own unique music score and narration style like the straight line missions?
Love british sardonic-ness
Lets go ! Very nice. Love your channel and I support it. Love when the video played and I didn’t want it to end. I love helping your channel by subscribing and liking even before I watch the video. Much love from USA east coast.
I like this idea, I'm sure there are some similar type journeys you can find throughout the UK
Always without gloves, this guy 😂
I bet a lot of American city’s you can cross 80% underground in sewer/drainage pipes  But that also brings the risk factor up 80% and the interesting factor down 80%
this feels like a video game im watching, i love it
Fab - Great content!
Black Country, No Roads
This is what Breath of the Wild looks like in real life
man
YESSSSSSS TY TY TY
This is such a breath of fresh air!
Introducing me to the Black Country for the first time by showing those overhead photos in the intro makes all of the people look like ants from up there
Wear a bright construction vest and no one will question you
Yes! I'm not a fan of geoguessr videos but i still check your channel after every upload in hopes of some kind of mission. My excitement is immeasurable and my day has been made.
I love how his accent changes when he talks to varity compared to camera.
what about black country new road?
This could be a very interesting type of video to collaborate with storror on
Don't ever change Tom. You being yourself has brought us all here. Cheers
BRO IM LITERALLY FROM WEST BROM 😭😭😭😭
"That looks like rat central...  ...oh well, let's go through"
The way hes just running past people im screaming😭😭😭
Seeing you do rooftop POV makes me want to see a GeoWizard x Storror collab vid
Dude! Seriously...
6:35 I though you might run into Ally Law.
All those wires in that water made me so nervous
at least you dont have to worry about staying on line this time!
this was gold comedy at its peak.
This is absolutely mad lmao
Should've worn better shoes and not a yellow shirt cause that draws attention. Like the straight line missions more though. More nature and scenery.
Pretty sure you'd find a third eye on that fish if you caught it.
Amazing content as always, but shouldn't have watched it while eating ;)
‘Trespassing with Tom’ gotta be some of my favourite videos
Finally these missions are back! 😊
Yay! Another mission series!  Just curious if there is any reason for this very square aspect ratio? (It does fit my iPad well though haha)
loving these scenes of our hero running through shopping centres yelling "alright, mate?" at strangers lmao
Surely you should have worn high viz, then people would assume you were doing some work.
love this and the straight line missions. looking forward to more :^)
Thanks for wearing that Oregon shirt representing my home state Tom!
"Why did I do this in summer?!"
I'm only 4 minutes in and I was trying to figure out what felt off to me. Then I realised I've only ever pictured you in camo gear.
32:41 First time I have ever seen a table like that used for a bed
I like that you call them "railways" instead of "railroads". Almost fooled me
I wonder how many people thought he'd just shoplifted when he was jogging through the shopping centers.
I must say this is a high IQ move by you. A seriously perfect new edition to the GeoWizard channel. I can't quite imagine exactly how you came up with this video idea but uhm its genius!
Me seeing a new GeoWizard mission: https://youtu.be/pDU9BOtX80A?t=1824
ffs, I'd rather do a straight line accross mfing Russia from east to west than this one.
Honestly brilliant production and simplification for dumbasses like me, assuming you mostly did all the editing and stuff himself.
Did you buy your girlfriend a new car? The last one was silver.
YouTubers always talk about how its awkward to film in public. Meanwhile Toms out here running around with a camera, yelling at pedestrians. Love it
What a beautiful first impression of Birmingham b😂
8:39 what's up jonjo shelvey
That overflow route was the best place
This is my new favorite video
Let's Goooo!
incredible
I fucking love these videos
I live in Australia and I could smell the green tub water by the car bumper from here.
Imagine being in that car and just seeing a camo clad man plop out of a tree onto the side of the road 😂
Great great youtube
Feel like Tom and Mrs should think about kids before he lands on one of those spikes...
This is incredibly dangerous Tom. WAY more dangerous than the straight line missions mainly due to the increased chance of running into man-made chemicals/substances that could make you incredibly sick.
All about this
This is like every 80's and 90's kids summer adventures, before computer games took over the world 🤣🤣 I used to get breakfast and was told to be home for when the streetlights came on when I left the house shortly after. We used to go for miles on our bikes or go exploring the areas around us, kids today will only see such activities in videos like this.
Black country, no road
We need a Storror x Geowizard collab
if this is your idea of an inconspicuous outfit for the city and you stick out like a sore thumb as a city boy during the straight line challenges, i can only conclude you’re a space alien who failed out of space college for intellectual reasons and got quarantined here as one of us
Haven't even watched the video, but I know this is gonna be good. It's like GeoWizard crossed with Storror.
Why r u running ?
I came to this channel to watch your geoguesser videos while I had nothing to do during the initial covid lockdowns. I still very much enjoy watching those videos, but these missions are the things that get me excited to click on when I see them in my feed.
This looks like "Try not to vomit from all the disgusting shit laying around challenge". If UK looks like this now, imagine it in 50 years from now, assuming people won't bother to clean this random garbage.
I'm about 95% certain the director of my department at work is sitting at the table at 8:38
Really mate, the most excited I get on Youtube is seeing a new mission video! And this one is an absolute beaut!
Good to see you starting the series properly, a beautiful Banks's Mild. It was only the other day I was at that maccies only by coincidence. Look forward to future episodes. From sunny Wolverhampton, Wolves ay We
One of the best channels going
The PIP GPA view is hilarious. Just like GTA lol
Maybe just me wanting this but I’d love to see you walk from Crystal Palace fc to Brighton fc, I believe it’s the biggest distance between two football clubs considered a rivalry in the premier league 🤳🏿
Pure gold as always tom! Keep it up!
I love Verity.
Wow!! A whole new type of mission!! I couldn’t be more excited!
Abandoned Railways? Say no more Fam, Im in
Top quality video as usual Tom, can't wait for the next video. Keep em coming.
Oddly I was way more nervous watching this than any of the straight line missions. Some of the industrial areas just had a really dodgy feel to them for me
Hilarious, maybe you should wear a HiViz jacket and hard hat next time, make it look like you're supposed to be there!
Tom really just said: "Let me figure out a way to do a mission where I can stop at a McDonald's" lol
Hold on to Verity...I'm not sure you could find another woman that would put up with your crazy hobby like she does.
a mission for @storror
whats with this square format?
It's certainly weird to hear the British "just about" because the American "just about" means "almost".  To say you "just about" made it, in America, means you didn't make it, but you came close. Apparently, the British "just about" is more like the American "barely".
You should start wearing a hi viz jacket because no one will question you
- there's no way out! **finds a door to get out** - GET IIIIIIIIINNNN!!!!
its truly an awful setting....... for a straight line mission hahahah
32:01 "shoulda just crossed the friggin' road" that sums up this whole video honestly
"It's  primark  im  worried  about now" ~Tom Davies.  Apr  2022
Oh my god it's red brick hell
Im sorry guys but there will be no episode 2 unfortunately Tom got arrested 😢
Black Country, No Road
Keep doing what you do Tom, you're videos are amazing.
I love the raw footage approach honestly i love seeing and hearing every part of your adventures  I dont know how to describe it exactly but these quests you go on bring back a sense of childhood magic and adventure
I live for these videos mate!
Here goes Johnny yet again..
I’m absolutely sick of how good his content is! Why can’t all of YouTube be like this
I would of not gone in that water! Fuck that
I love these series, I've watched the Wales/Scotland/Norway missions at least twice each.. just brilliant stuff!
"It's not a road.I make the rules on this channel." 👍 Edit: still refuses gloves till after getting thorn attacked.
urban exploration, my fav. initially got "into it" when i was homeless, but kept it up as a hobby even after getting my life in order
You’re absolutely mad man the content is always so class
You are a bloody legend man. Great idea, great implementation
my king 👑
Next time you gotta just throw on an orange worker vest !
Always love the irl adventures
Just wondering, but why is he running trough the shopping center?
Why would you go for a 4/3 video instead of a 16/9
walsall sounds like warsaw lmao
yess
Roads?  Where GeoWizard is going, he don't need...roads.
The mind set of 'everyone is a copper'. One day, just one day you'll just act like you own the place. It's Britain - no one cares. If anything it's like cows in a field, they all look, are any of them going to stop you - no.
Love to see you do an adventure in Wolverhampton, so many green areas to explore in west side :)
ъЪ
On this episode of "Let's go trespassing..."
when its room temperature outside the british start melting
Already excited for more of these.
Storror has GOT to hear about this challenge!
shoutout to tom for always finding another amazing video idea
Love the content as ever Tom, just wanted to say the was we treat the little bits of nature we leave in the gaps between our machines makes me so sad. I hope we can all do better so the fish and you can survive for more missions in the future.
Loving this one so far, a nice break from the open countryside in Wales. Looks fun to do a bit of urban exploration in dirty overgrown places than no one goes to. I've always had a fascination with abandoned railway lines too!
Tom, please, wear eye protection. it looks super sketchy when you're walking through thick brambles with your eyes exposed like that. its very risky and you can easily have your eye poked with something
I hope the thumbnail is a reference to the band to Black Country, New Road
Please get into Parcour, Tom!
I will say it feels a bit whack to me that you are using all these roads, which technically arent roads, but it sure feels like they are. Not trying to discredit this, just wish it could be done without them, or using them sparingly. Maybe the concept just didnt hit that well to me, as straight line missions did.
Love this type of video, and recognise a good few of the locations, Halesowen born and bred. Keep up the good work!
Whenever I see something like this, I wonder how we navigated the world before roads and civilization. This guy can barely move through any of this stuff. How did the early hunter gatherers make any forward progress to, you know, hunt or gather?
Missed you man
This reminds me of the beginning of Half Life 2, a whole lot lol. Thanks for putting your life on the line for us for content, and Happy Easter!
ladies and gentleman. white privilege.  lol!
I can smell this video
I feel like I need a shower after watching this video
Great mission idea and brilliant first episode. Coincidentally, I am visiting the Black Country tomorrow and will be going to a point on your route!
I really do love this channel. Bring me joy with every video
Man I just live in Glasgow and I've spent a fair amount of time in England traveling about but I barely recognise any of the shops there, but I will say some of the words on your list are straight up Scottish
Tom, I was full on expecting you to start at a Weatherspoons.
Something that he still hasn't learned is not bringing a pair of gloves ahahaha  Spoke to soon.  You did start wearing them ahaha
walking around a city in full army surplus gear makes you look like you're about to pull a Raoul Moat
BCNR fan Tom?
Major W
Truly the grimiest GeoWizard experience
IT'S BLACK COUNTRY OUT THERE
why did he go into the sewers lmao
Nobody:  Absolutely nobody:  Tom: "Let's jump in the shit stream then go to McDonald's!"
Do you have poison ivy, sumac, or oak in the U.K. or other plants that can produce blisters on contact?
Tom, ur a legend
McDonald's was the most dangerous part so far!
I thought one of the main reasons I love the straight line challenges is that anyone can take the same route and attempt it themselves, but doing something like this is garunteed a different process everytime. Love it
Watching this from the northeast US makes me cringe so hard being so used to the risk of Lyme disease.
This reminds me of a guerilla tourism technique where you find the first and last streets alphabetical on a map and make the shortest path between them. Good way to see non traditional parts of any city.
Myself being a lad from Dudley, this is great to see. Looking forward to the next episode :D
I don't know about this series... I don't want to be a detractor but sometimes it seems like he's purposely doing things that are more ridiculous because it might be better content than just going around.. In straight line missions it makes sense, but this its like "just go around, why are you going this way."
You crossed the road at 18.30
Urban exploring with intentional destination is such a dreamy premise.
Awesome content like always
As a man from Birmingham I appreciate this content
I just absolutely love the adventure content. Does anyone know if there's any other channels that do similar content?
Yes
How to catch a venereal disease part 1. Thanks Tom for risking it all for our entertainment!
Why is he running through shopping centres lmaooo
10:00 crosses a ROAD
Get in
This was really fun, can’t wait to see more. :)
Honestly best youtube channel around
"This time on 'Avoiding confrontations': not even trying to have a chat with the workers to see if you can just pop through, instead get in the horrid urban waters!"  I mean, it's not like the water option is gone, were they to say no. Work on the socials a bit, not saying to go full social engineering, just ask some blokes if it's alright.
If you listen only but dont watch from around 5:38 to 5:48 you might think this is GeoWizard's sextape
It’s 12am on Easter Monday, but I’ve been waiting for this
It's black country out there
BORING!
I think next he should do a no walk mission. Hop, skip or crawl. No exceptions
Feels like some Storror training could have helped.
This is some great stuff mate, very entertaining!
<3
You are = you am.
consider wearing a heart rate monitor to add to the video
Really selling the Black country there, looks like a lovely place to visit !
Was wondering where you were Tom. I know you have a beautiful girlfriend but I literally love you. Your content is THE best :)
@16:43 Is that marijuana plants growing there?
I could walk over 5 miles in my town and not walk down a road, I can cross many, but not walk down one. Trouble is, it would be easy as its a national cycle path going throughout the town!! So I could cycle it too lol.
Great use of “mooping” 4:24.
I think you should take a parkour course with this content in mind, no roads urban adventure looks cool for the content and we won't mind you styling a bit!
"Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads."
Luckily everyone watching is a law abiding citizen and absolutley not taking any notes about the first 10 mins.
Cross ireland in a straight line! Dublin to Galway would be a serious trip!
this country really is disgusting
Just had a big joint and thought there'd be fuck all on youtube. And there was this.
Could he be wearing a brighter t shirt?
MissionWizard
I need to know what you got on the McDonald's monopoly thing
This is a really stupid idea, I love it.
The livemap on the side is a great feature! It really enhances the viewing experience.
i just checked hoping for a new mission last night, geowizard was just watching out for my bed time
Tom, do be very careful of needles! All it takes is accidentally getting poked by one on the ground and you could end up with hepatitis, hiv, or worse for the rest of your life! Stay safe, use gloves!
Brilliant
That was done last year summertime? Causd today is Easter and April so. This was 2021?
This is a classic way of journeying the country. It pays homage to the land and the parts that are still accessible where water can flow. I love the history photos at the start. Got a bit motion sick watching this epi but stuck it out.
I love watching this content. You are doing a very good job... Keep it up
Love seeing some black country content, can't wait til you get towards my ends and I recognise more stuff haha
I've been to Walsall once... once...
Ally law meets geography nerd
Storror would ace this.
Should have invited the Storror boys on this one Tom! 😂 Great video
very nice
How does he run that fast with balls that big?
Should bring a hi-vis and clipboard next time, and just walk through everything like you belong. Not sure if jogging in full camo is the best way to not get noticed haha.
32:40 casually walks up to Mcdonalds wearing full camo military gear stinking of sewer water.   what a king
British man in his natural habitat
"I'm not sure why this is so heavily fortified." said the man standing in junkie grove.
You should go through the catacombs of Paris
Tom you King. You've blessed us all with another beauty ✨️
Love the whole vibe of this one. Almost as if it could be a 'pick your own adventure' where you are the playable character. Do we go down used condom alley, or risk incarceration, you decide!
Up to your nuts in that beck after miles n miles of city run-off collected in that water 🤮🤮🤮
Black country is bostin ay it
Love the BC, NR reference
How long till you get a message from the police? Ahaha good video but it’s coming
This is great the best part of the line missions is the technical bits, not the open meadows and moors. And the technical bits in this are much more varied.
10:48 do I look really stupid? We can barely see you
Great video Tom. Wear a high visibility vest and a clipboard next time you're somewhere you're not supposed to be at. They'll think your just a service worker.
Black country no road vs Black country new road
I mean, you walking down a canal and talking about what your plans for the future are would be a different kind of video but still interesting
Car wait to see ya gew thru wednesbury, yow deffo was close ta fallin in the cut where it woz full of shit perpa   and in english: Can't wait to see you go through wednesbury, you certainly was close to falling in the brook where it was full of toilet paper
really good
I have even harder one for you: Get to a walmart without using a car in USA
"im going to stop by a few pubs along the way, just to refule, you know with beer" funny would have thought you would drink milk
When you tried to knock on the back door of greggs you had me rolling
Worra dive the black country is mush
Oooooo
Seriously though how did u find angel verity
I'm so excited for this 🥰
This is a fantastic review of Walsall. Really makes me want to go. 😂
Shoulda worn gloves my man
Shame you couldn’t go through Wolverhampton on your route! Then again you probably would have been stabbed
The “how’s everyone doing, alright?” bit @8:39 was pure partridge! Love the content!
5:41 : when its 4:30pm on a Christmas Eve and you've yet to do your shopping
Cant get enough of this Chanel , this man is a legend
Going 10 miles through terrain like that in 5 hours sounds near impossible
I like how he speaks about "we" to the camera. As in, "we" just need to cross here and such. So yes Tom, I am here in bed staring at my phone while you are marching through rat heaven, but "We" are doing well. :')
got to say, I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would, and I thought I'd enjoy it a fair bit, good job! Also I can totally see this being a parkour challenge on some parkour channels xD
I remember the first missions when climbing a fence seemed risky. Now he just runs through a service area and starts climbing between rooftops, in casual gear too. What a legend.
Absolutely Nobody:   Tom in military fatigues : "HELLO Y'ORITE HOW YA DOIN?"
is that the first GTA VI official gameplay?  beautiful
Tom’s videos are like if Merry/Pippin were the main characters in lord of the rings
Appreciate your effort on the subtitles
I wonder if Geowizard ever played Half-life 2? I'm specifically thinking of the canal mission.
What a coincidence, tomorrow I'm going on an expedition in the UK for 3days/2nights  Love your videos, very entertaining and encouraging!
This is... so incredibly cool, I don't know what to say
28:00 it's not a stand, it's a substitutes bench lol. I enjoy these so much. Almost 35 minutes video, goes in a blink of an eye. Don't keep us waiting too long for other parts.
Can't watch this just now but I'm so excited to catch it tommorow when I'm home from work.
😳
It's missions! Hooray missions!!
You need some safety glasses.
I'm from a town just north of the Black Country (Stafford), and this video has cemented my view that the Black Country is a pretty shit place to live, even in the more secluded areas there's litter everywhere  Edit: This will be a very entertaining series to watch though, good job in that aspect
Bro, this is excellent. I love that you’re changing up your content.
love :) from great barr
I feel like this is the type of thing to do with Storror
Late April's fool or not, this was awesome.
This would have been a great collab with Ally Law.
do you know that you can capture 16:9 footage with gopro?
why are we running?
Damn another banger serie
Loving the Oregon PNW shirt!
@0:01 "...feats carried out in this series *ARE* dangerous and require..." Just in case it's legally important to get the grammar right. @GeoWizard you're the best. You've brought great joy to many in dark times and inspired countless to go back to their roots and tackle nature.
Where's your f*cking gloves? Straight into brambles and not gloves. Lol. Why?!?
Watching this early before he has to take it down and cut things out, I remember how you crossed the rails :P
New title: “How many diseases can I catch within 3 miles?”
The start straight on a roof is hilarious 😂😂
4:48 STORROR!
not enough of your songs
Not going to lie, it’s weird seeing you turn
After me hearing Warsaw all this time - now is the time to cross Poland in a straight line. Can cross my land no problem.
What is it about britain and spiky fences all over the place, somtimes in double rows combined with that spiky evil shrubbery? It seems to be absolutely everywhere?
omfg yes bcnr reference
banger
epic!
I saw this video pop up and yelled "YESSSSSSS" because I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED AH I LOVE THESE VIDEOS WITH MY WHOLE HEART
Mate the shit you do for content is the reason I keep watching, keep it up
Camo in a city parking lot. Verrry unobtrusive. You'd be better off with a clipboard and a reflective vest. Or maybe a pram and a beehive wig.
Well that’s just dandy. WONDERFUL…      No, I need to be that side.      Ah SHIT
man should've just YECGAA-ed
As an Australian these missions make me so anxious, because I just assume every single brambley off-road patch is full of snakes. 😂 I wish I lived in Britain. So excited for this new series, you're the best Tom! Actually second-best; Verity is obviously #1 on this channel!
Does this count as Parkour?
Have you considered parkour as a past time?
Thank you! Stay healthy and safe o7
Funny disclaimer about fences cos about a month ago I did try and climb over a spikey fence and tragically failed, impaled my leg and had to go to major trauma to get it all sorted, fine now tho so dw
Tom: "What's that fox doing there?" Fox: "Wtf is that human doing here"
Hooray!
8:55 oh, "saddler’s" centre - could have sworn you said "sadness" centre at the start of the vid lol
This guy lives in the town next to me, it's so cool seeing so many places I know on a YouTube challenge like this
How did you come up with this one? Great stuff. Nice to showcase another part of the UK to the world too
Black Country No Road aka the world's second best ButthoIe Surfers tribute act
I kinda miss the old soundtrack, but I also associate it so intimately with the straight line missions, so I totally get why you didn't use it here.
That was awesome! But how can there be so much trash.
the next video is going to be one of those parkour police chases😂
Somewhat strange to see you making turns
"How you doin mate oroit?"
Love your irl adventures
This is soo fun to watch.  Though I’d appreciate it more if the video was on YouTube resolution. Instead of it being blocky
This has made my weekend
It is shocking how much trash there is. Honestly, next mission is "How much trash can I collect in x-amount of time". If you can inspire people to go on straight line missions, I'm sure you can inspire them to collect rubbish as well. Either way, it was amazing as always, can't wait for part 2!!
Black Country, New Road reference in the thumbnail?
Dudlayyyyy
It's so funny to me when Tom says 'don't try this at home.' The whole reason I love this channel is because everything he does is so far out of my comfort zone, I would never ever even think of trying any of this.
It's interesting how certain activities could be interpreted differently depending on the location.. Running in the countryside: bloke getting exercise Running in a shopping centre: thief Wearing full camo in the countryside: army-related training Wearing full camo in a town centre: local nutcase Climbing through woodland in rural Wales: camper / rambler Climbing through woodland in Walsall: smack head.
You should take a high vis jacket and hat with you for the trespass-y bits. Hide in plain site. Just Look like you belong there
funniest vid yet, the commentary gave me a good few laughs
It's so sad to see the amount of rubbish people throw into these natural areas.
I absolutely love the minimap! Super excited for this series.
Its only a road if it has a name
Lynne, I've just pierced me foot on a spike.
19:14 ok that was pretty funny
Lovely, I would love to see you do something like “how not to travel Europe” it was absolutely class
Omg haha we have one of these in my suburb "Mt Roskill" in Auckland, not as deep , and when I was say 12 or younger, I walked and biked through the whole thing with my  bro haha, was well over 40mins 🖤💯
05:40 that’s what she said
Fun fact - if you travel from Kidderminster to Birmingham by train at night, the glimmering lights of the Black Country look pretty from the relative comfort of the train. It's one of nature's great illusions.
Super appreciate you not crossing the train tracks :)
I can hear the smile on his face while explaining the rules! so good!
3:18 very first thoughts: "Yes, bright yellow t-shirt is a perfect choice for not getting caught" 😅😅😂😂😂
I love your adventures so much!!!
IM INVINCIBLE IN THESE CAMO PANTS
Straight line or otherwise these missions are some of the best content on YouTube.
such a fun video, looking forward to the upcoming parts :D
that little britain intro was absolutely amazing. i love you so much, tom
My favourite psychogeographer
Great video but might I suggest fixing the spelling error in the disclaimer? It says "and" dangerous instead of "are" dangerous.
The reference to “black country, new road” makes me very happy Tom, thank you
Best cold-open to a series EVER! Superbly sets up the totally different environment you are dealing with and also the mood of these adventures! Genius!
Glad to see you back out exploring especially after the events in your recent mission
i just want more outdoor content it being a straight line doesnt matter. just less geoguesser bruh
It is really horrible to see how much rubbish is lying around everywhere, even in places where (thanks to the blackberries) there are hardly ever people. Guys, throw your rubbish in a bin!
This is just brilliant. I know the black country vest well and fully expected a secret life form to be living in those areas
Wonderful
Fuck, I was searching for a part 2 thinking this was uploaded a while ago untill I noticed it was only uploaded an hour ago
great excuse to use if you ever get caught is that you've lost your drone and it ran out of battery where you are
Tom Davies is my hero
You’re awesome Tom!
That went by so quick, can't wait for the next one.
Anyone else thinks it's strange to see him make actual turns? It's like the rook became a queen. I really had to adjust to this.
Remember some of these places as I have been and Erasmus student in Wolverhampton for six months. As a great fan of GeoWizard, this makes me smile.  Saluti dall'Italia
tom: *Worried about getting caught by security in shopping malls*  also tom: *runs through talking to camera in most suspicious way*
This has got to be the most difficult way of getting to McDonald's I've ever seen.
I know I'm being THAT guy, but in case you care, Tom, the disclaimer at the start has a typo - you put "AND" instead of "ARE."
Like all your other challenges...why don't you do them at night?...
I recommend Coventry for another series of this
20:19 Sounded like gunfire lol
Brilliant
This is the exact road my parents took to school every day
Love the accent change when greeting the other locals 😂😂
I think the best strategy for this would honestly be to take a hi-vis vest and a hard hat. With all the places he's going through if anyone saw him in an outfit like that they'd just assume he worked there or was someone from the city doing maintenance.
Forgot to pack the gloves again!! By the way, this is the sort of sniffing around urban places that I never did as a well-behaved kid.
You nutter. Great content. Alright Skip
Crossing Chernobyl in a straight line 😂
As someone from Telford it’s nice to see the rest of the West Midlands is just as lovely 👌🏻
ITS BLACK COUNTRY OUT THERE
This is amazing. Right up my street. Literally. Grew up in willenhall and now live in Dudley.
What's the Song from the intro? I remember it from somewhere haha.
I feel like he's getting more and more addicted to this stuff, soon enough its gonna be rooftops only
This seems like the sort of thing you should team up with Storror on.
I find it interesting how Tom decides to wear a yellow top to attempt this mission
Is there a parallel time Verity video ?
Imagine some junkie just chilling near that fence, seeing Tom in full camo gear and trying to tell his friends. No way anyone would believe that shit
Tom, I live near Walsall. What day did you do this?
Thanks, I'm 20 minutes in and I've already come down with dysentery from just looking at the water. 😂
This one is honestly one where I feared for your life. I'm not sure highly urban areas are the right path.
Absolutely disgusting... I love it :D
The city tried to remove the brambles and overgrowth but the junkie's union stopped it.
Not necessarily a fan of urban exploration, but an awesome video non the less!
If Shiey was from Birmingham and stopped for a pint between climbing a shitty warehouse.😉😂
Should pass through Cannock Chase next time!
Are you from the Black Country?
was this filmed last summer
This made me proud to be British
You’ve no idea how excited I am for this, your're my favorite content creator in recent memory and l and I was just expecting geoguessr!
Pretty sure i spotted my house in the beginning lol
I could watch Tom do a 'Walk to Tesco for a pint of milk adventure' and still be enthralled.  Love from Wales ( No relation to Welsh Greg....I think)
You're greeting people on the street like Arthur Morgan farming for karma
Babe, wake up. New GeoWizard challenge just dropped...
That was the best intro to one of your videos yet!
Just as I thought it would never come... buzzing to watch this.
Be careful of syringes
this came out of the blue
I wonder what something like this would be like in a more historic town. Or perhaps a region that is depopulating heavily. There's such a wild variety of urban environments and this is such a unique and cool concept. Its like a more flexible version of the line mission, where you get to explore niche little areas of places most of us find mundane.
Exciting video, looking forward to the next one
Every time you ran I felt like I was playing GTA
black country, no road i love this band
Is that thumbnail 'Black country, no roads' a reference to a certain band?
The absolute pinnacle of British navigation
Wow literally stole it from BlackCountry, New Road smh.
Great video one of my favourites! Are they coming weekly?
8:52 super brummie accent
I love this type of off the path urban/industrial exploration! It's almost like a kind of strange inhospitable world hidden right in plain sight in the middle of everything. Love this!
Couldn't Verity have just bought you another T-shirt real quick since you were around all those shops? lol
Do it via Iraq and Syria. Gerrup
The smallest capacity stand? That would be a dugout for the players Tom 😂
Questioning why you chose to run haha, good job
Yo, STORROR needs to do one of these!!
Why do I get so anxious when hes trespassing 😂
Not since you were stuck in the bog, have I feared for your life more. Plus I'm going to assume that the tourist board for Walsall,  should there be one, will file a takedown notice on this vid, before it's seen by the rest of the world.
The full camo yet no shirt underneath makes you blend in quite nicely with the local junkies.
Decided to look at sub box and noticed this. Great to see you adventure again!. Love these types of videos from you
It's not a proper adventure until you've donned the camo
crazy how much trash there is just everywhere
Tom: "It is possible to get from Walsall to Dudley along canals, but that would make a pretty boring video" Me: "But would it"
banger band reference??
4:47 Assassin’s Creed Black Country
Roooodney! Rodney Throbber.
8:00 'oi you cant park there mate'
Words from the black country dialect: Female = wench... that had me going! Perfectly placed on that list Tom!
Tom"That looks like Rat Central!"  Tom again"Let's go through.
imagining poeples thoughts when tom just runs by them in the shopping mall brings me great joy
The straight line missions are great, but this variation adds so much diversity and intensity on top of that. Awesome job man!
Humanity is feral
Tom, why do you always use squared screens like you're still in the 80s xD
Brilliant Tom
Looking forward to this I liked your straight line missions. I'll watch this tonight when u get home👌👌👍
5:03 i guess you could say the people in the shop look like "ants from up there"
Tom keeps making this next level content, someday he'll walk to africa
Parkour!
Good old walsall 😭
"What was I worried about?" Leptospirosis possibly?
i have just watched a man trudge through mud, sludge and shit for 30 minutes to get to a mcdonalds (and i thoroughly enjoyed it)
I love how chill the vibe is in this challenge. Like crossing Wales was a huge ordeal but this is so relaxed by comparison.
22:32 Post10 has entered the chat..
Gary Powndland!!! No way, used to watch him at the Hollybush in Cradley.
Storror x geowizard? 🤔
This video was awesome :) Very excited for this series!
but a lovely video
calm down lad
Half a minute into a new straight line video and Tom is saying "This is one of the worst things I have ever done", that's when you know it's gonna be a good one.
7:51 "Get in" Technically, more like "get out"... 9:41 "Wonder if they'll let me down here." Good thing Rick Astley isn't in charge of security there. He would just say "Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down... 12:51 "I won't be going on any train tracks today, don't worry." You mean "No teleporting today, don't worry." 26:53 Rule number 1: Tom never stops thinking about footie.
I feel like I've learnt a lot about the various kinds of refuse the british leave in their waterways!
wonderwhy collab when
"How ya doin' mate y'aroit?" Ah yes, using the local lingo like a pro. They'll never suspect a thing.
No gloves.. again
This was absolutely amazing. Can't wait for more
You should really do this with some sort of sun/safety glasses. Other than that this is wild!
one for the farmers.
The concept looks cool on paper, but what I feel watching it is mostly disgust. So much waste, shit, garbage, it just feels so much more stressful to watch than any of the straight line missions.
I clicked like before watching in the first time of my life.
A cool twist on this sort of mission, would be that you are allowed to use roads etc, but its about not being seen by anyone :P  imagine a multi day mission in the city and having to find a place to stealth camp as well.
Getting some Storror vibes from this haha. And only a couple of minutes into the adventure, I'm stressing out at your potential run-ins with security in the same way that, occasionally in your straight line missions, I stress out about farmers. But that's a rare occasion, whereas I'm sure the chance of running into security on this mission is much higher, especially with CCTV cameras all about in urban areas too.
You don't look stupid, you've just gotten the wrong sizes! Great looking gear though!
The part in the sewage water made my skin crawl. Good stuff
I love it. Amazing how we've just completely built our cities around cars and roads and just trying to get around without them is like a subversive act.
Still refuses to bring gloves 🙄🙄 omg mad lad pulls out a pair of gloves.
⛄️قال لي
You have to love Verity for putting up with these crazy missions lol
No way, a 'no roads mission' was an idea I'd had after watching the straight line missions! Awesome, this will be fun :D
what I learned from this video is, that british like to throw bags filled with junk over fences.
britain is such a beautiful country isnt it
Alternate title: Watch me Trespass
I'd love to see you do some videos like Shiey's train jumping across Europe, I feel like that would be super entertaining!
YEEEEESSSSS DUDE I LIVE FOR THIS CONTENT I’m so fucking happy right now 😂
lol it's crazy to see a youtuber i like to watch in walsall.  i live in walsall, and there is many people who don't know walsall exists but live in england.
I would rather die than live there
Perhaps the first video from Tom I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I didn't realize the role played by the beautiful backdrop of nature in the straight line missions. Absolutely appreciate the effort put in to make this possible though, and Tom's commentary was lovely as usual. Just my opinion, don't let that stop you from more "No roads missions" if majority of the audience enjoys it.
yeah yeah¨
Loved the little Tom progress map in the bottom right
this is what i like
Awesome mission! I’ve lived in the UK 13 years and love a lot of things about it. But the amount of rubbish and crap on the sides of roads, in canals, undergrowth etc is just awful. It’s sad to see.
nice music reference in the thumbnail tom
Favorite videos on YouTube. Your originality with types of geography videos is unmatched. Reminds me of MrBeast in  how extreme you are willing to go for your quests.
You should get the new MTP kit, its lots better than DPMs, as it has loads of pockets and is more comfy, however, not the best at camoflauge due to its tan nature.
I have now decided to never visit Walsall
Rodney? Rodney Throbber? 31:04
black country, no road
U R stark raving mad, man
This is so great
Odds on I'm expecting for tom to find a body.
You're right by the shopping centre, you should have nipped in to buy an emergency t-shirt!
i love you tom
comfiest youtube content in this era
I hate when people say they hate McDonald's, except they actually love McDonald's. It's hard not to. It's chemically engineered for it to taste good to us.    I hate that I love it.
This is the best content on YouTube
16:16 I'm getting some serious Paul and Rebecca Whitewick vibes here!
Mate if you didnt do youtube, god know what youd get up to. In the event of an apocalypse, I'm landing at yours.
Holy fuck you are mad, great content.
Was fun to watch
Fish be like this is home has been since great granpa was abandoned here
should have worn a high vis vest. nobody would have questioned you then, urban camo
Love your work!
This is what I subscribed for. Thank you Tom, for representing our little shithole, Dudley and the Black Country. (yes you do read that with the accent)
When I’m older and have kids, I’m gonna show them these Straight Line Missions. They’re some of the most intriguing authentic content on YouTube and I feel a sense of comfort whenever I watch them.
I think this may be your best mission yet. Fantastic concept and a perfect place to do it, can’t wait for the rest
YES what a great easter sunday surprise
As someone from this area, this video makes me feel so exposed 😭
shiey collab?
Im from kingswinford and the fact that i am familiar with the area makes this mission sooo much more fun to watch 😆
This dude is cray
Simply A Class stuff Tom, so entertaining!
just incase my comment can help anyone else, photosensitivity warning for a couple seconds at 9:12, 9:26
love your content!
Awesome!
The amount of industrial waste is just saddening. What are we doing to "La belle verde"?!
dropping a comment for the algorithm and to support our lad tom, what legend. get in!
It's really annoying being badly in need of a t-shirt, but you're stuck in the middle of a town centre surrounded by shops
Does this thumbnail mean Tom is a BC,NR fan??
Amazing!!!
another banger video
Fuck yeah
Protip: high-vis vest gives you access anywhere, no questions asked.
Absolute chaos in this video, love it
Black Country, No Road.
Love you Bear Grills on Sterioids !!
Road is lava! I do love these videos, but oh god, they give me so much anxiety!
Yesssss
Yes! A new idea that will make a nice addition to your other adventures.
I first thought you said "Shut up" to the fox xD 16:24
I found it so difficult to not be like “that’s not a straight line!". But this is class man
this type of urban mission is so much more unnerving, and it is fantastic
Stoke > Black Country
Dude running dressed like a terrorist
Just watched the Sidemen race from London to the Eiffel Tower, but Tom Davies climbing shopping centres, knocking on the back door of Walsall's finest Greggs and running through multi-storey car parks is the most thrilling thing I've seen in a while.
Honestly the strait line missions were getting boring
We dont deserve you tom ! Big love from a solihull lad
Forget Black Country, New Road  From now on it is Black Country, No Road
ow am ya?
Ally Law who. This is the man we want
yo, black country new road reference? probably not but like cool
"sewage fungus" that's what the grey stuff growing on the plants was when you were in the brook. Very common at sewage works outfalls and sewer storm overflows.
You’re insane Tom
ive been watching mostly geoguessr stuff just a bit of your straight line missions but i must sayTHIS IS SOME SERIOUS FUCKING CONTENT..very much enjoyed this, pls keep it going
This was fun :D  I kept forgetting that it wasn't a strait line mission. XD  Well done with the mini map. Very easy to follow. Looking forward to the next episode!
It’s an easter miracle!
Honestly i would enjoy like a normal hiking vlog lol
Absolutely lovely this
You should join forces with Storror and do a challenge with them! Imagine an urban parkour route!
Another great adventure.
The Black Country Tourist Board have been in touch to ask for the video to be taken down I am guessing.
I've lived in both Bham and Dudley, you're mental for doing this and I love it 😂
awesome
YES! This is so good so far :)
Mans natural enemy, Primark.
Love these type of videos tom they're brilliant 💪
A hi-vis jacket would serve you well in these urban challenges
Urban wild foliage is some of a nastiest toughest foliage out there.
He isn't coming dahn far enough to my area! Boo
What! No Scratchings?!?
Get in!
Wow this is a great idea and I can’t wait for part 2!
What a start! Little bit of rooftop parkour, dogshit dodging, some stinky water wading, on through the rat tunels, junkie camp bonanza and McDonald breakfast just in time :)
Ah my "lovely" hometown,  Looking forward to rest of this!
6:10 *everyone suddenly sells their shares in the shopping centre*
Mate, you better go see the doctor for a full series of shots, lol 😆
I'd love it if somehow you managed to accumulate and compile all CCTV from that day into one big alternative supercut. Of course that isn't possible but a man can dream
GeoParkour ? Interesting
Got lost with my 5yo on a hike and had to go round way around farm fields to go back to the car. Seen a nice opening in a fence and I thought to myself 'Tom would of loved that' 😂
31:46 "No unauthorized access" Put that on a t-shirt and sell it lol.
I was curious when was this filmed?
this sure was something new. This is a nice mission too. Did you think about it yourself? Great effort into all the work of doing it.
what about some old roman roads
I had so much nostalgia watching this for being a kid and just exploring every last inch of my hometown
30:29 The N-word is written on the wall on the right.  Has anyone noticed that Tom's accent changes depending on whether he is talking to people or to the camera? It's more Birmingham when talking to people and more refined when talking to the camera.
The start of this felt a lot like this French guy called Vintage Tran who goes to all sorts of places in Paris he's definitely not supposed to be.
I`m loving it…
USA and Canada, etc. speak English. But, I can’t get over how amazingly funny and sarcastic the British can make the language sound. I grew up on Monty Python, etc. Tom, you’re absolutely hilarious. Don’t let it stop being natural. You’re crazy too, but that goes without saying… love your videos!
Walsall  looks like a dream holiday  destination
I'd rather be knee deep in river shit than eating mcdonalds chicken nuggets, my god there horrible 😂😂😂😂😂
Another mission.... yeaaaaaaah boiiiiiiii
Tom about once a month: Alright, how can i best torture myself Also, good job on that first bit
England really is beautiful
Cool, this one is like a 1st person video game.
Fuck yes, new adventures with my favorite geography guy (or geodude)
"Why did I do this in summer" Tom, it's April.
This is actully him just training for his Primark heist
Running looks super suspicious XD everyone will think you're a pickpocket or shoplifter
I miss doing this sort of thing as a kid.  The wild/abandoned places that I used to roam have mostly been replaced by crappy new builds now.
There isn’t a YouTuber that I’d want to crack a beer open with more than Tom
It’s weird seeing you voluntarily going round corners hahaha
Is Tom a Black Country, New Road fan?
This is the worst Storror video ever.
As a bit of a germophobe, this was a nightmare to watch. Fucking legend Tom.
Comforting video as always. This sort of feels like a British version of Shiey.
is this a Black Country New Road reference??
On an urban mission you want to look like a building inspector. Safety west and hard hat and the world is your oyster
YEEESS! More adventures! And it's varying content, you really are one of the most entertaining youtubers!
hey
starting with parkour, omg...
Bloody bosstin ar'kid.
That first bit was like watching someone play Mirror's Edge. The next bit then turned into Fallout 4.
Incredible, can't wait to see the other parts of this adventure
best. mission. ever
This is the coolest mission yet
I am so happy that Tom keep getting crazy ideas!. Here is a toast to many many future crazy ideas from Tom, which i will look forward to watching! :D
Retail Parkour
makes stoke look good
I've been watching your videos with my American girlfriend ever since you attempted crossing Wales for the first time, and now I get to show her where I live through your lens. This is going to get interesting. Thank you, Tom!
U abit cracy!!! but a good video
Oh mate, this series is gonna be a banger. Pretty sketchy though, with all those junkie-locations. Don't wanna step on a needle by accident.
arent we kid? :D
Can't believe you didn't get stabbed, innit
How Tom caught Hepatitis, part one.
Got to get yourself a hi-vis and clipboard for passing through all these factory yards and secure areas like the mall roof. Nobody questions a guy in hi-vis with a clipboard.
i really prefer this aspect ratio for content like this
this is something that would be fun to do, there are less problems (maybe?) that can occur than the straight line and the only main problem is security guards. I know you said not to try something like this but I may have to give this a go at some point, idk where tho, in my area its just boring suburbs
just noticed the black country, new road joke in the thumbnail. heck yeah
10:40 is he talking in another dialect all of a sudden?
It's so weird seeing my home area as the setting for this. Good luck fellow yam yam.
Our Straight Line Mission across Scotland:  https://youtu.be/jjDWpKLtjZU
one of these days dude is going to end in jail ...
To me, watching this, it's like a movie almost. It is so amazing what your doing, and I love this kind of content. Travelling through an area, gathering new experiences, etc. As somebody who grew up in a ghetto, I understand a few of the places you went to. I grew up going on trips like this, and still do things like this, for the same reasons as you. Wonderful content!
Always look forward to these IRL adventures
This video makes me want to visit Walsall. It looks like a lovely place
you would never have gotten me into that brook. could not believe you went in.
I love that you keep innovating! I love this concept, it’s a bit sketch but that’s what makes it great!
I’m from walsall so watching you do this is a lot of fun for me 😅
Very much liking the black country new road reference in the thumbnail
I grew up in a post-industrial town and spent my childhood exploring weird non-spaces like that brook, all those fenced off areas that only adventurous kids and junkies knew about. This is one of the best videos you've put out and I can't wait to see more.
This calls for a STORROR collab!
Cool new video concept. Do be careful though, I would hate for this series to get you the attention of some coppers and then that to make it harder for you to do straight line missions in the future. I've followed train hoppers on YT, who because their videos got enough attention got banned from going back to other countries.
Underground tunnel system mission next, please.
You said you've done this in the summer. So it's like 10 months ago?
Tom Davies will be the first Cholera case in the UK in 100 years
This is so good. And funny!
"It's Primark I'm worried about now."
I would recommend wearing a yellow west in these industrial areas. yellow west = no one will give  a shit
Do you think there's risk of electrocution on top of some of those buildings? Some of those power lines scared me a bit.
you act like a escaped prisoner on the run
hell yeah brother
Just what I needed on a Sunday evening. Love it!
Find Isaac and tell him to go back!
Why does Tom say “Rodney!” As an exclamation? Who is Rodney?
Dude that thumbnail is a reference to Black Country, New Road. Please tell me at least someone else noticed?!
Good shit, Tom! Shared it to a friend! Hello from Finland! 😊 🇫🇮
Love it!!!
Yo its my brother in the video at 33:55 I'm not joking it actually my brother 😂
Happy to see you at you best so this was going to be a solo run ur was nobody up for it
Have these videos always had black bars? Not sure if I'm going crazy or they've always been there.
Such a great man Tom. Would bloody love to go on a mission with you one day. Your second wales mission started a few miles from where I live, made me want to piss off farmers and walk across their fields
Straight line across Yorkshire when???
Fucking brilliant content
black country, no road
I used to do No Road challenges with my friend in my city. I live in quite a major city in the UK, but a suburban area, quite difficult really.
Thought there might be a few Alan Partridge 'foot on a spike' moments at times. Well played.
how is no one commenting on the little britain style intro. pure genius
Roads? Where we're going we won't need roads 😎
I can't stop hearing "Warsaw" so now I want to see you crossing Warsaw.
Hey Tom, I was reading a couple days back, an army captain is doing a straight line mission of his own. From Lands End to John O' Groats.
This may actually top the Wales Straight Line
Hey Tom, I do water quality monitoring and that looks like sewage fungus, good indicator of frequent untreated sewage discharges. Probably glad you didn't know at the time 😂
This is exactly what i subscribed for, love these series, hope you wont run out of things like thise soon
This is, probably, a stupid question, but wouldn't your face be on every CCTV camera along your route? And wouldn't it be possible to press charges of trespasing basing on those videos?
I find it so funny how you don't say there's a time limit for the first 15 minutes or anything, and you're just dashing around Walsall like you're on the run
Roads?! Where we're going we don't need Roads!!!
Never realised I lived in such a shithole til I saw it in third person 👌
How many bodies and murder weapons are in this brook?
The little Britain music at the start is perfect!
I'm two minutes in and he mentions that it "might" be legal!!!!!    Iove it!  Loving the heads up display map.... And he is wearing a Or-ray-gun shirt!    This may be the most GeoWizard post of all time....now waiting for the "Are we filming?"
Didn't expect a parkour mission. This is even better
This is a really weird BCNR song
Really needs a high vis
19:18 lmaoooo
Sees a heroin junky camp then wonders "Not sure why this is so heavily fortified?" re: childrens playing field next to it. Excellent glove use though.
Whilst you did look a bit ridiculous, I suppose no one is going to approach a man dressed fully in camo in a town centre during hot weather. I would cross the road to avoid you!
Nightscape collab coming soon?
I don't understand why you were running the whole time
Tom is the last person on earth that still uses 4:3 format. And he probably doesn't even know why himself.
Oh, nice! I was born and raised in the Black country! Nice to see some familiar sights! I wonder how close you'll get to the place i lived at for 30 years...
I wonder if saying “I’m on the tv show Hunted and I need to go through this shop” type line would do any good
This makes me want to go pick up trash in nature. So gross.
oh shit walsall is where gayry newbman lives creator of the worst game of all time: rust
Just wear a high-vis and you'll be fine anywhere lol.
Amazing concept...
Love that this channel has gone from an obscure (great) browser game to the best adventure channel on Youtube!
löve it
5:37 Me when a GeoWizard video drops.
People copying you my come across some big troble like drug needles or drug lords, mafia or something like you already mentioned. But interesting content anyways
Still. No. Gloves.
Awesome. Inspiring, however I’ll keep to watching you  do yours. Hoping for a ‘no road’ review with all the planning etc.
I LOVE the minimap edit, but it spoils where you end up going! It should be the predicted path or just the yellow you've already shown on camera (if that's possible) so it doesn't spoil the rest on screen
me when i see tom’s uploaded a new video 05:39
LET’S GO!!!!
Sure the most general definition of a road could include the parking garage ramp, (although if we use that definition literally everything connecting two points that a car can drive on is a road) but most people would agree that the ramp is a part of the actual parking garage, making it a feature of the building rather than a separate thing.
Tom what’d you think of Ants From Up There?
lfg
Tom you should poke the water with a stick to check depth before hopping straight in
Hint for the future high viz vest and a clipboard will get you most places!
The dreaded Farmers have been replaced by the worker in this one
"And I'm gonna stop off at a couple of pubs along the way, ahhh, just to refuel, you know, with beer" - and there we have it. It's really just a big glorified pub-crawl. "Very experienced at climbing spiky fences and such obstacles" - there's a good one for the resume.
Loved it!
grammatical error in the disclaimer, no big deal, noboady read it anyway
oh, tom. no gloves again?
Haha great vid! I’m from rowley regis and work all over the Black Country to it’s nice to see some familiar places. Keep up the good work! Thanks
Amazing
I love the variety of adventures on this channel. Always keeping it fresh.
This is kinda weird. I liked the straight line missions there was a clear simple objective and the natural obstacles were challenging, but this feels a bit stupid, just a grown man running through an urban area for no reason, and grabbing beers along the way ? Just not that great of content in my opinion.
Is that a back country new road reference?
I lived in the black country for 4 years Tom and this is just insane to see!
Does this count as parkour? I say yes. You should do another mission like this with Storror or something lol. Great vid!
This is how our parents described how they got to school everyday
i am invincible in these sunglasses
Use me as a thank you Verity for keeping up with this idiot button
That’s tank is likely a sewage transfer station, and the pumps are likely unattended.
Been really looking forward to a new mission! I am wondering though if the "How not to travel Europe" series will ever make a comeback. It was my favourite thing on youtube by far
“Get in!” count: 1  @7:50 and @8:16 1000 Luck stat let’s goooooo
Love the idea of doing a more urban/city based challenge. Adds in new things you need to think about as opposed to maniacal Welshmen and sheer cliffs.
This looks interesting
i was hoping this was a black country, new road band tribute video but i guess i’ll take this masterpiece instead
Tom actually having permission to go through somewhere is a twist
Do one in London
Please invest in a 4k60 GoPro.
This was amazing! It was like a mix of GTA exploring and those 'being chased' dreams I always have =D
you forgot the yellow vest
7:51 get in 😂👌
hello guys
maybe if you would have worn a high vis it would have been easier
you need to learn parkour, would be so epic
in this series AND dangerous
I’ve been so hungover today thank you for this upload, im pretty sure he uploads on Sundays just to appeal to that hungover in bed category of viewers ahaha
13:35 *Stops in the middle of climbing the spike fence I've been climbing*
What a treat! I didn't expect the next mission until the end of the year!
Well the classic "wear gloves!" never gets old
Tom and everyone else asks "Oy, what's the Fox doing?" but no one asks "HOWS the fox doing?"
Have you tried wearing gators on your missions, they are very good at keeping water out of boots!
Parkour parkour
A true legend of the game.
the absolute pinnacle of british orienteering
Great video, thanks for sharing. Did you complete the route in wet boots after wading through that water? Must have felt pretty gross, squelching as you walked!
10:15 that's not Walsall that's Iceland
Why all the concern about security?  Is that normal for the UK or is that just drama for filming?   I can't see why anyone would care.   Around here no one would say boo to you except maybe the train people that don't like people crossing the tracks except where designated.
You can say it's not a public road or highway, as a way of distinguishing car parks and ramps etc.
Feel like I'm watching Stalker II by Andrei Tarkovsky.
Wow, literally going through so many brambles where people took tactical poops.
I absolutely love your adventures! I have been watching your travelling around europe in as many ways as possible series with my mum and we're huge fans! Keep it up!
Tom is my favorite Brit since King Arthur, what a guy
would you like a genuine austrian military jacket ? i buy and sell stuff for a living and have come by load of them , very thick heavy and warm and there green. let me know happy to send you one if you like.
Tom gets caught speeding on an on ramp to a motorway and gets pulled over  He says to the officer: It’s not a road mate it’s not a road it’s a ramp I make the rules round here
I really hope the "black country, no road" is a Black country, new road reference
Sweet video, how come you were running?
I have nothing to say really, but I appreciate your content, and wish to help with the yt-algorithms.
Ahhhh iev been waiting for this ,Watching from zimbabwe🇿🇼🇿🇼🇿🇼
8:51 Christ don’t do that mate you’ll get stabbed
Look at Tom's parkour skills
Tom sneaking around a city and mumbling to himself while being dressed like an insane person/paramilitary/terrorist. This says a lot about the English. In another country he would have been shot. 😂
Just watching this gives me anxiety. I'm way too socially anxious to ever even think of doing this haha, it's mad.
To any Americans, this is urban England, not London
Love the little Britain music at the start!!!!! ☺️
Anyone else feel strange that he’s not walking in a straight line or is it just me!? 😂😂
Other youtubers: "Dont try this at home (I dont want to be legally liable for your injury)"  good guy Tom: "Dont try this at home, I dont want you to get hurt"
Let's be honest...... England is a fucking dump.  I felt sick watching most of that.
Love your videos. Hope you won't suffer from your covid infection in future
"it's not a road. I make the rules on this channel." Fuckin love you dude lmao
OIII I'm from wolverhampton
A+ series name. Did the idea for this video just come from the band's name or is it a happy coincidence.
can someone explain the 4:3 ratio on the video? his google searches are normally 16:9
After seeing all the other straight line missions seeing a line that isn’t straight throughs me off
this is like ally law meets geowizard
Last time I was this early Tom was still in Wales for the first attempt
Please promote the band 'Black country, new road' for having such a similar name to your title. (unless he actually referenced it)
It's a road.     Still, nice adventure.
why are you running ?
was the pun in the name "black country, no road" intentional because it sounds like the band "black country, new road" and if it was, great music tase and also great video
Me seeing a mission video from Tom in my Sub-Box: OH YEAH. BRING IT ON! brb, getting popcorn!
Awesome adventure! I really enjoy the urban setting, and it's very interesting to learn about the Black Country!
Represent, big up shithole
Nice
Is that title a play on the band 'Black country, new road'? They're one of my favourite bands!
Been looking forward to this, I’m from Bilston!
That beginning was like watching Storror but bad, going across the roofs
Next challenge should be : go into a straight line in Ukraine and try not getting killed or captured.
Amazing!
I was gonna say ‘why would you head to Dudley’, but then I realised your travelling from Walsall so I’m not entirely certain which is worse 😜
This is legendary
Your missions always keep me watching with bated breath! Very nice to get a new one
Ohh boy here we go!!
BCNR in the title is that?
(not Welsh Greg) cracked me up XD Great video as always!
now that's one of the most interesting 15 seconds of a video ive ever seen and im immediately hooked
That Bingo hall is huge
Been waiting for another adventure, love to see it
Ah my hometown.
There is a spelling mistake in your Disclamer 0:05. Should say "Are dangerous" on the second line instead of "And dangerous". Just letting you know
One day he'll figure how to record in 16:9
Wow, this seems like something I would enjoy, as for your straight lines missions. I've always been fascinated by traveling atop roofs and buildings in a densely populated area. I haven't watched the video yet, but I imagine you are going to have to do all sorts of stuff to travel forward, like balancing on fences and walking on balconies. Edit: I might have overlooked the amount of bushiness and greenery in this area. Edit 2: My assumption that I overlooked the amount of greenery and forest he would be using immediately got proven wrong in the first clip where he literally mentioned that he would be climbing over a literal roof.
This is like the slowest parkour video ever and I love it
Damn this just became a lot more illegal
Goin’ round the Wreckin, eh Tom? 😉
So excited.
Looks like this will be a fun series, can’t wait for the next episode. BTW can I recommend a straight line across the Netherlands. It’s not too long on some stretches and provides a new challenge with no places to hide in the flatness and endless farmers plus many ditches full of water
5:38 lmao.. a solid “that’s what she said”
Kind of reminds me of half life 2.
@5:12  OREGON!!!!!!
Your video title should be 'BLACK COUNTRY, NO ROAD'. Just saying :-)
Curious as to the aspect ratio of this video? Is it because of the GoPro?
New series, sweet!!!
So excited for this!
Finally!!
Black Country, No Road
Yeaaaaaaaa
Can not appreciate Tom enough for making us such good content!
Certainly one of the Top 5 British lads ever
I love your videos! Keep going, man.
Typo on the warning screen, happens to the best of us 😅
Tom you're a natural. Your instinct for what's entertaining is dead on the money. I love you
Black country, new road reference in the thumbnail?
With that opening scene, I know it’s going to be a laugh 😂
this legend. i’m so glad i found this channel on that first straight line mission. thanks for all the entertainment. here’s to many more years of it!
A wicked idea for a new adventure, proper enthusiastic especially being just up the road from the Birmingham/West Midlands area! Stoked, mate!
It's not a question of if, but when Tom gets tetanus
Let's gooo! I'm so excited. Your straight line missions are some of the best content on Youtube and I imagine this will be on the same level!
I'm from Old Hill (which for some reason gets classed as part of Cradley Heath) and am born and bred Black Country
Black Country, No Road
Oh my fuck i just realised this is a real challenge and not geoguessr! I love it but now I'm far more excited
I love your adventures
Varying content with a certain theme is hard to pull off but somehow he manages to do it perfectly
I've just been binge watching your old videos from across the years across the past days. In fact i was watching your debut twitch stream right as i got this notification. I've also legitimately watched all of the straight line challenges at least 10 times each. Sometimes i just put them in the background or fall asleep to them
i love to commit crime -burger40
The absolute pinnacle of british content
I've never clicked so fast on a video in my entire life!!

All your irl vids are fire Im sure this one is no exception
Yes!! He's back.
I've been waiting for this!! Commenting even before  watch it eeeek ♥️
What a mission. Thank you

“Babe wake up Geo uploaded”
Yet another great one
Hi

Btw Airrack stole your idea
I once went to a Black Country pub, I needed a translator.
Straight line mission cold opens: "Will Tom be caught by a farmer?!"  Black country mission cold open: "Will Tom step in the bag of dog shit?!"
You are such a legend Tom, so glad the YouTube stuff has been working out and I can't wait for more of the best content on YouTube. Cheers and I'd love to buy you a pint someday, verity too(the real mvp of the channel!
Awesome editing
