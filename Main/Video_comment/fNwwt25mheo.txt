House Of The Dragon is coming to HBO Max in 2022.
House of the Dragon was amazing, the fantastic cinematography, music, political intrigue, the twists of Alicent Hightower and  Rhaenyra Targaryen’s journey, also man seeing Vhagar gave me chills! The size of the dragon, absolutely incredible.
House Targaryen now and always.  🔥🐉
"Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did"
Season 4 please
best teaser of all time comin from someone that had read Martin books and I love his work so much this show will go down in history as the best series of all time season 2 wasn’t good but I have a feeling season 3 will follow the books a lil more let’s just hope that
HBO is gonna f*ck this up again
I got this on my recommendations rn after I finished the second season😭
Goddamnit release season 3.
Before they ruined the story and characters....
looking back its crazy that they knew how much of a hit this would be that they dropped a first teaser almost a year before release
I was so hyped that there were 15 minutes left at the end just to find out they filled it with making of content. I feel very much betrayed
I'm watching this again and it's felt like the first time,HOTD is a crazy❤️‍🔥
oh my gosh is it out yet??!
They should keep daemon with this hairstyle
this might be the most legendary teaser of all time
Where it all began. So ready for s2
I need u back😢
It's actually 200 to 300  years during the rise and fall of the Targaryen dynasty I mean sure it'll fall several centuries years later but this is only the beginning and with the biggest and destructive bloodiest civil wars westeros ever known as ((dance of the dragons that brought one of the most powerful dynasties to its knees and collapse)) and I'm excited for season 2 with the war just beginning
Season 2 please
just came here after season 2 teaser and i still remember the day i saw season 1 teaser
Can't wait for season 2
Watching this in 2023 ❤
Daemon's voice is music to my ear
Exactly two year later this show didn’t disappoint.
Ok Max, today is the day for you to give us a new Teaser for season 2! 🥺

A masterpiece
Rings of Power sank, so that House of the Dragon can float 😅
Season 2 please!!!
I wonder when we’ll get the first teaser for season 2
It is great
What's with the Velaryons being black this is so dumb.

Wondering who are the next Comedic Duo....
Waiting for season 2 😂
Excellent
🤩🤩🐲🐉
So I can assume season 2 shooting is also done
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zMo4tUe9Cg :)
Come!, let us drain our cups to the STRONG first season.
This show was WAY better than I thought it would be!
I really want to know if the Targaryens have the ability to survive in fire just like Dany did. It would be Awesome if some of them have. ❤️❤️
Here after watching the 1st season
vengo despues de el final de temporada , y les puedo asegurar que no los decepcionara
Can't believe how many times I've watched this trailer before and now the season is finally over!
AND THE DANCE BEGINS 🔥
Can't believe it's over now😭
this was last year and know season 1 ended cant wait for the next 😭
Dream didnt makes us kings. dragons did
It’s a wrap for season 1
Here after the season 1 ended on a high note. Holy shite!
So the first scene in this first trailer will show Daemon searched for Vermithor.
Who is here after episode 10 preview😄
Exactly one year later this show didn’t disappoint.
Didn't realize how many scenes were from episode 7
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
The fact that most of the scenes in this trailer didn't air until literally a year after this was released.
🐉
A SON FOR A SON.
Aaand the series is already rushed
look on Bran Stark from a child he became a grown man through the years. her replacement will be a huge mistake
"Every time a fart is born, the people grimace and hold their breath."
The house of the Velaryons is very ancient. Its roots go back to the Valyrians. Some of the Velaryons formed families with the Targaryens before the War of Conquest. The blood of ancient Valyria flows in their veins. They retained the characteristic Valyrian appearance - light skin, silver hair and violet eyes.
❤️‍🔥🐉
Watching this teaser trailer after watching the first 2 episodes if HOTD, hits a lot harder now. So much is at stake. We're in for an emotional rollercoaster ride.
hbo max spawn o filme
After hearing that jon snow will have a spin-off sequel in the form of a season 9 this will only make me happyer. If the show prison break has managed to come up with a new season after so many years, the best series of all time can do this too to get a redemption arc.
I watched the first episode and was a bit bored. Matt was good, though. He always is. He carried the first episode. The young queen has a slight annoying presence, and I am not really bothered if she takes the thrown. That is not the best start to a series.
Corlys Velaryon... wtf
Daemon 🥺✨
Бля вот реально, были бы у меня драконы был правителем
best project
Season 8 GOT is the worst of all!! It was rushed and the ending is not worth watching at all. Same for this HOTG, i know the ending will be devastating, waste of time! Don’t be fooled!!
*(Movie Trailer Voice over Guy)* _"In a woooorld, where Peter Dinklage is somehow still in it"....._
Doctor Who in westeros!
Is this a Horror Movie?  ?????
I want nightwalkers Winning this time😂😂😂
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WHINING G.O.T WE WILL NEVER BACK TO THIS COME TO THIS FANS?............yah right.
And I liked the ending it leaves room for another Game of Thrones after the House of Dragons and shows what great writer's you have. I give it a 10 out of 10! I'm a writer my self and understood the end of Game of Thrones
Gotta love that red abd black targerean colors with green and bronze rheagal jon's UAB dragon.
Did you know my birth father was or is blonde hair blue eyed?  6'3 180.
Game of thrones is a top5 most successful show of all time, these internet savants and armchair critics would have you believe it wasn’t because their fan theories didn’t come to fruition. To this day Game of Thrones is one of the 3 most streamed HBO originals, tell the haters to get in reality and get out of their uncles bathroom, they aren’t being touched anymore.
[Kernel;redsn0w] A!!!!+++++!!!!A
I love HBO MAX.  All this people complaining about GOT.  I on the other hand felt the actors did a phenomenal job, I know they entertained 40 million I don’t care how many sequels they make. I am  with House STARK, common HBO JOHN SNOW deserves his story, that’s why I will watch the ORIGINAL GOT over and over because of John Snow!
Is that the voice over of the actor who played Ramsay Bolton? Those r some great lines
Sad sad to say looks like woke garbage.
Let me guess: more miscegenation and black people shoehorned into it.
👍
Remake Game of Thrones season 8.
Why did this teaser gain more likes than the other two trailers?
From 9 to 1 of is name
9 أشهر مرت كأنها يوم
This teaser is better then the trailer 😎
Now after this just redo season 7 of GOT and give us a proper ending
Hindi trailer released
Chewbacca in this one?
Is there a release date yet?
Woke will ruin this show
The only wierd thing are those Pokemon helmets lol :))))))
wait until the Fairy types creature exist, they will surely balance Dragons 😉
The sound in this trailer is so frickin' good. Listened with headphones on, and Matt's voice echoed straight into my frickin' soul. I know there are people who don't like that he was cast as Daemon... But if there is one thing I know for sure is that Matt is a phenomenal actor. He WILL do a good job. I just know it!!!!
That thumbnail is a thing of nightmares
Oh it's Whoopi Velaryon.
Morbius reference
How HBO Max In India ?
As also targeryans were practicing black magic once..    What if..? The 3 dragons with dany Drogon,rhaegal and viserion are danys ancestors who got converted into dragon eggs using black magic to protect them from their enemies which they were not able to defeat.If it so it would be biggest twist 🤧hope it isn't like this .
Can you do it not in complete darkness this time?
Hyped af for this show but should it not be “A HBO production” not “An” hahah
Hopefully we get the origin of the night king
Hope it has a good climax
will is fill in the shoes of GOT, like can it beat GOT in the shitiest ending tho!
Y'all I'm not making any claims but GOT did refer to Elon musk as belonging to house targeryan. Now we all know what happens when a targeryan is born ..
there are blacks, but gays? if there are no gays, then America will overthrow Biden from the throne
Dont mess IT Up Like the Last 2 seasons of game of Thrones
Make sure Dumb and Dumber are kept far away from anything that has to do with this show. they've made the world suffer enough.
Will the last season be a big disappointment as well?
Big thank for HBO studio 🙄 game of thrones is awesome 😎
The characters are not suited and very ugly looking.game of thrones are best for the characters only..
CHEESY
🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
Prince Phillip?

IT IS SO DARK IT IS HARD TO SEE. Glad you are carrying on the tradition of GOT there HBO.
Too dark. Can't see action.
I am dreading to watch the final season of this series. I do not want to be disappointed again.😳
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
for my part ! Even more sequels to the GOT series should be made. Loves from Turkey   :)   this series should never end, I believe that if the series ends, everyone will get cold from the HBO channel.
Please dont make this some woke garbage
White hair, don't care ...
I have so much trust in this. Full source material, George RR Martin guidance, D&D nowhere to be seen... and a spectacular plotline. I intentionally didn't read the books even though I know what happens, if they make it right (which I have a lot of faith in), this can release some of the sadness and anger that GoT and D&D left us.
wtf.. Rastafari Targaryen woke
*Whats the 11th Doctor doing in Westeros?*
this directed by the same Dumb and Dumber?
The Tullys in HOTD:  “Dreams did not make us kings. Muppets did.” 🤣
please another trailer
What you guys did to GOT season 8 will never be forgiven
#RenewRaisedByWolves
#RenewRaisedByWolves
#RenewRaisedByWolves
No HBO, nope 🙅‍♀️ You will not take my money after I endured watching GOT last worst ever 2 seasons!
I wish dragons will talk this time
As long as its not made by Dumb and Dumber i'll give it a shot.
Hard as a rock right now.
I really hope dan and dave weren't allowed within 100 miles of anywhere this was filmed or written
Matt Smith ! Well, now I can’t wait to see it.
Just PLEASE don't pull a woke OR a season 8 on us HBO.
Hope House dayne is properly covered this time, the ancestors of Arthur dayne deserve to be shown
Can't wait
If this is some woke BS i am not watching it.
Dreams didn’t make us kings , dragons did👍
damn
I will be watching this just for Matt Smith. I need this to come out like yesterday.
when is it gonna be out?
great!!
why you're not Hindi dubbed  why please I'm happy to Hindi dubbed
Hindi dub plz...
I'm sorry, but did I missed something? The targariens should look amazingly beautiful right? What happened here...
I'm not watching this. No matter how great it is. HBO Should listen to fans and go back to fix the nonsense they did as season 8 for game of thrones. I invested years of my life watching that show. That utter rubbish called season 8 needs to be re- done 🙄
Alright, why isn't anyone talking about the sheer brilliance of Ramin Djawadi here? This music gave me the chills.
After the trainwreck that was season 7 and 8 of GOT the publiv deserves a new epic series. I hope they don't ruin it like they did at the end of GOT. I just rewatched it and it was sooo good, until the horrible and absurd ending where they didnt even explian the white walkers. I just can't get over it.
The first four seasons of _Game of Thrones_ were phenomenal, especially the fourth season. The show sank more tragically than the RMS _Titanic._
God, Rhaenyra and daemon cast are perfect. 😵😵😵 that close uppp!!
Can't wait
The best series of all time MUST have a sequel. As long as the STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE are maintained. Hoping to be SENSATIONAL like GAME OF THRONES. GiseleMoreira - BRAZIL.
Wait this is real? I thought its some kind of parody at first, so I started laughing but then i was like: They must be joking!
Is this yet another fantasy show that's going to be ruined by identity politics and bad writing? Or will this actually be something different and great?
No thanks! Only a fool would invest years of their life watching this after the got finale catastrophe. Not interested!
I kind of forgot about Game of Thrones
The BEST news since the Covid-19 pandemic!
Well, Doctor who is  goin places. Would've been cool if Tardis made an appearance also :D
Kangz, no thnxk
To be honest, I wasn't interested until I saw Matt Smith. He'll make a powerful king.
'Dreams didn't make us Kings. Dragons did'. Sounds like Matt Smith who, funnily to me, sounds like Iwan Rheon's Ramsey.
Looks lame
As great and exciting as this is, how I wish they began with Aegon the conqueror and his two sister-wives.
George, please finish the damn books.  It's the only thing the real fans care about.
Oh GAWD Cant wait for this!!
Looks like all those boring scenes with Daenerys in the final seasons of GOT, only it's the entire show.  Huge budget and spectacle, but completely lacking a pulse.  I realize people want more GOT, but the franchise will never return to what you loved so much about the early seasons.
I would wager that this series may even be better than GOT because of the rich source material that is available, they can also add in more if needed. If it is executed with the same finesse of the earlier seasons of GOT it will become what 'better call saul' is to breaking bad.
Pfffffhahahahah! Wait., u serious? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! Phew. No.
Unless your here to fix Season 8.... I'M NOT INTERESTED!!!!!!!
PLEASE DONT RUSH THIS
is this the new skyrim? :o
I dont care after season 8
im so sad that every dragons will die. And even in the future they go extinct again since rhaegal dies...
looks great
Oh man, new company new series, lets go David Zaslav put this into new streaming platform on Launch :)
hope Ramin Djawadi will continue to produce soundtrack for this series...its really take the previous GoT series to the next level...
I'm so glad we're getting this masterpiece after the disappointment of the new "LotR" show, the difference is incredible.
one like for George RR Martin 👍
Can you see the head of the dragon standing right there ? I have a feeling that's balerion , the biggest dragon targeryens rode . 😏😏
Io non riesco a vedere GOT di nuovo. Aspetto i draghi.
not even first minute and already thr feminist agenda shows its ugly face again
First of all, I don’t see any purple eyes
Soundtrack seems out of this world
So not pumped for this at all. Would much rather see GOT season 8 redone. If it if they had to sub cast members.
Will it have the same amount of nudity as the last one and hopefully dragons right from the start?
Came back here to watch it before watching the new one again! It looks perfect. 🤩😍
I just wanna see dragons
If the Mandalorian can show up in the middle of Book of Boba Fett, maybe House of the Dragon can flash forward to Season 8 and finish it.
<3 Matt Smith!  Maybe it's just the trailer, perhaps the show will be different, but it looks like after all the complaints about GoT being too dark for many people (and their particular TVs), they're still going for grim-dark-moody where some fans won't be able to make out half of what's going on.
dance of the dragons LETS GOOOO I STAN QUEEN RHAENYRA WOOT WOOT
HA! Groids can beez "Valyrians" tooz....makes sense
my god i hope the series is better than the trailer
Meh, to much woman worship in cinema today. What we need is some good old fashioned 1980's style man worship.
Is there anyone else, who are not satisfied with the casting?? I don't know why🙄
Please don't go woke ....we want Kings not KaNgZ
This guy is supposed to b good looking? Dude doesn’t even have eyebrows
OMFG🔥🔥🔥
Maybe it's because it's still several months out but I don't feel excited about this at all.  I might just skip this one
Like will we be hearing dracarys everytime a dragon fires??😂😃
Milking the series... we need new talent!
Love Rahenyra Targaryen, Viserys true heir not the usurper Agon
I’m sure HBO will find a way to bring race into it.
Didn’t this get cancelled?
Best part about this is DnD have no hand in it. They won’t get bored half way through and then ruin it to get it over with.
Drop the trailer pleaseee im gonna cry
HBO i would like to kindly ask WHERE IN SEVEN HELLS IS THE DAMN TRAILERRRR
Dear HBO overlords. Please note that fans prefer satisfying (if predictable) plot conclusions over subverted expectations.
That’s Ramsey Boltons voice right ? Either way perfect for the trailer.
Hindi releases
The mad kings reign
Ağustos bir an önce gelebilir mi ?
When when when again
Great .. More dark screen bs so that you can barely see anything going on. FR who was in charge of the lighting for all this?
Hurry up
When is it coming 😫
bit upset david thewlis wasnt cast
We're going to see the greatest battle in 2022! The Lord of the rings vs House of the dragon 🔥
Ok whats going on with the black targaryens
0:45 Is this Rob's voice?
Release the trailer please
I can smell the downfall of the HBO from this thing.
So whats the explanation for the black people
Idk how y’all didn’t think maybe it was in bad taste casting corlys velaryon as someone of African descent when the faction he’s a main supporter of is “the blacks” and they’re supposed to be the same race as the Targaryens with similar features
I feel like everyone has forgotten that this is coming out soon. Only 3 months away now.
I never got the complaints about Season 8, other than the pacing.   The story itself resolved reasonably.   This series could help fill in some of the gaps to explain how easily the dragon fam goes kookoo quicker than most.
Need Hindi
Another adaptation of a good book their gonna ruin
Corlys Velaryon blackwashed. 😆😆😂🤦‍♂️ This is a joke. Remember: Go woke, get broke.
I was so sad when GOT ended, im glad we still get something new to watch
“Dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did” 🔥🔥🔥
will we see balerion in this?
I can only assume that this series will be as dogshit as ASOIF was..hence I wont pay to watch it
I literally didn't even know this was a thing until 5 minutes ago....  My first thought watching this was, why is the decision to make characters BLACK so prevalent? You never see Asians, Hispanics, Arabs, Indians, being brought into predominantly European shows/casts. I don't understand the thinking to this day. It's as if no Races in film exist but "Black" or "White". None if this is even logical.
RIP Netflix. Netflix succumbed to the madness and someone had to put it down.
I gotta read my copy of the book before this comes out so I can pick the show apart like a chicken bone.
I did a quick search said something about premiering in August. I’ll be there. I’ve only gone to the movies once and never to a premiere. I loved GOT so hopefully all goes well.
Fire and Blood 🔥🩸
Release the carnage.
after the way the main series ended? sorry i'm not stupid

I pray the old gods and the new to make this show a great one. I hope it can even become better ! If the writing is like the first 4 seasons of GoT, it's gonna be IN-CRE-DIBLE
why are there black targaryens?
Get back to me when the entire saga is finished, and I'll binge-watch it if it gets good reviews. There's no what I'm investing my time in this after GOT series 8.
O fogo reinará em breve!
Is this after they conquered westeros? I was hoping for the conquest.
Also release it in hindi
2022 lo ostundaa? Maaku nammakam ledu Dora..🙏
Did that idiot even finish writing the books of the first series..??
Watching this trailer again and again to find some easter eggs
Just finished fire and blood and well...i'm kinda excited tbh
Dubb in Hindi as well
I don't care how it ended.  I still want more.  It was the best.  Can it be anything like it was.  Just give me violence and comedy I'm happy
How bad was the GoT finale....bad enough I won't get back on this ride.
is no one gonna talk about the Velaryons getting blackwashed 😂😂😂 sooo cringe honestly, with the blonde hair too
Whoa 😳 extremely excited , don’t break it at end please.
still watching
Meanwhile Joey tribbiani after watching this - some people are too ugly to be on tv🥲
what is the point of this series, we all know how it ends
THE DOCTOR IS BACK.
💀 hoping they don't throw in unnecessary seggs scenes with this one. they're nearly all related
WE WUZ HOUSE VELARYON N SHIET
I can't wait!
Any update? 😊😁
This is how a trailer should look like 👏👏👏💪
never again.
I. CAN. NOT. WAIT!
Is this Rob Stark's voice??
Wow!
Sorry, HBO, the answer is *NO.* For not firing Dumb & Dumber when you could have. “Fool me once...” etc.
Everyone excited for Targaryens while I'm just sitting here hyped out of my mind for the badass Cregan Stark. One of the best Stark Lords in the history of Westeros. Ned should've followed his example smh
I’m so freaking pumped for this, I hope it has the quality character development, and story like the original beside the end. I’m pumped for it
Wonder if those whom didnt watch or closely follow GOT can follow this new show without being lost?
idk why ppl act like the show peaked in season 1-4 and just got worse, season 6 was easily the best season and while season 7 made some weird writing choices it was just as entertaining as any season, season 8 was epic and visually amazing but story and writing choices were just plain awful and disappointing
Really hope we get the first blackfyre rebellion in a later season as well. Skip all the boring stuff in between and jump straight to the next big Targaryen civil war, I dont care if theres no CGI dragons, Bloodraven, Daemon and bittersteel should be enough to carry that story
Is the Rasta a targ?
Hope its not as disappointing as the ending of GOT. Flash back i hated the GOT ending
Targshits dying in mass is the only thing this series will be good for.
awesome sauce
HotD will be more cool than GOT because it has a good material of dialogue and Fire and Blood is one the interesting novels i suppose 💛
Me Aegon the conquerant & my dragon Balerion,  why weren't on this sequel ?
That is before the mad king ?
Just me not bothered [much] by the last season of GOT. Curious about this show.
aaaaaaaaaaand they cancelled it lmfao
What is Heimdall doing there ? 0:38
When is the full trailer coming??
It’s sad really because the ending of Game of Thrones left such a bad taste in my mouth I don’t think I’m going to give this prequel a chance.
*THE ELEVENTH DOCTOR!!!!! AMY & RORY NEED TO BE THERE TOO. This is another reality lmao.*
So hyped to see Vhagar!
House of dragon vs rings of power who will win?
Hope they adapt the story well like game of thrones season 1 to 4
Just... Come on... Youtube channels can do it already. Make the Targaryen eyes violet please~
A man likes what he sees
This seriously reminds me of game of thrones
Is that Ramsey Bolton narrating?
Probably the best part of all this is that the budget is going to be insane right from the start. Took GoT like 3 seasons before HBO started pouring in an ungodly amount of money into it.
Sir plz also released in hindi dubbed at any cost . We will pay
I am very much excited!
Gonna be soooo much Dragon carnage! Gonna see a lot of them eat people too lol and die
I know how selfish and shallow this sounds, but after seeing The Queen we Chose for “7” seasons…I really thought that all Dragons were supposed to be beautiful…
Chills... 😬😳
So tired of all the criticism of GOT's final season.   The show ended extremely well...elegantly.   It was wonderfully well-written,  just as the entire series was.   We loved every minute of it and were not at all disappointed.   In fact, we are watching the entire series again,  even as we speak!
Like any great empire good or bad they fall. I love how the said that the dragons made them where they are, instead of taking the credit for themselves like they did it all
I won't watch untill you make Dragon Queen Kept alive💯💯💯 Anyone like me?
OKAY BUT IM PRETTY SURE THAT DRSGON WAS BALERION THE DREAD
ow yar tm logo nay abi kiu bta dia ha Isky bary m surprised b tu hota h na🤨🤨 Ab kon w8 kryga 😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Need more dragon house for last GGM book
How do you know a series has fallen? When you discover the trailer for the spinoff a whole 6 months after its release.
Let’s keep it at 4 seasons please, alright, thank you ❤️.
When will it release?
It was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  "It is dragons."            "Dragons?"  said her mother.  "Teora, don't be mad."       "I'm not.  They're coming."       "How could you possibly know that?" her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.  "One of your little dreams?"       Teora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  "They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died."
disappointing
I'm watching this once a day until August
We wuz Targaryens!
#marvelandDCandHBOMAXismePJnow
John snow 🥺🥺🥺
0:44 is this luke and aemond or someone else?
Hopefully they don't pull a Dexter 🤣🙈
When it is coming?
Im so scared to try this, im still geeling the pain from the final season.
A man will watch
Cregan Stark. Hour of the wolf. I know it'll be at the end (if at all) but would love to see this power house on screen. Favorite stark in the books personally.
I can't wait! 😄🔥🐉❤️👍🏻
Even the trailer looks underwhelming
Make it more dark , I wanna see my reflection on the screen 😒
Still not able to see new trailers or show start date.... Eagerly waiting.... Start the season with Dany's resurrection and then the flashback
aside from everything, Matt Smith's voice is a total eargasm.
SPOILER ALERT!!! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Or not..?
Word is the season will run for nine episodes and the finale will be due out some time in the mid 2030s.
I’ll miss drogon. He was the best part of season 8
Why not make a continuation to game of thrones with Ayra Stark adventures
I hope is better than the Rings Of Power
Two people I really want to see are Cregan stark who was considered the greatest swordsman of the era and hand of the king to Prince Aegon the Younger. And Dalton Greyjoy, the iron born lord who for nearly two years sacked and burned  the westerlands (essentially reviving the iron borns old ways)
200 years and technology hasn’t advanced in Westeros?
Yes
This better be good. Not ruin like game of thrones ruin the ending
Most emotional scene in the entire series when jon snow kill our queen the mothor of dragon breaker of chain Daenerys Targaryen 😭😫
Cant wait❤️❤️❤️❤️ 🇮🇳
OMG Mobi also here🙃
Blood and fire
I really hope they follow the book and the characters personalities to the very end this time they destroyed the ending last time
So the dirty pirates are royalty here whahahahhaha please GTFO 😡
We need trailer please 🥲🥲🥲
Wow! Can’t wait!
I want to see the wildlings
Will there be any white walkers? I want to see white walkers too!
Is it out already?
The visuals 😍
Hard pass because we all know where the series went
Nice! 😀
When is this coming out ??? There’s absolutely nothing to watch on tv
come on be good pls be good
Too bad. I was really hoping to see the black dread alive but I guess that we will only see his skull again. But I think it will be a great show even though it’s kind of sad to know how their dynasty ends. :)
they did the mother of dragons injustice
Really looking forward to this series as the Targaryans are my favourite House and I loved the story of Rhaenyra.
Can't wait🤩🥰
After a disgusting 8th season of Game of Thrones and The Witcher, it's hard to wait for something worthy.(
Is this the story of Aegon II and Rhaenyra ?
YESSSSSSSS
I’m going to be 45 when this is over
Dragons are Coming....
Don't add black people for representation value like that and ruin the story
Weeeeeee!!
When in 2022?!
I am going to wait and see but first red flag is how they chose to portray corlys velaryon
how many season will we get or could get
❤️
I wish they had purple eyes
Is anyone else having issues with the dissonance with the Corlys Valeryon character? If they wanted to add black characters to the show or greater narrative, couldn’t they’ve expanded on Jalandhar Xho, the Summer Isles, or Sothoros? I can’t take this show seriously if I’m expected to throw out all my imaginations of the appearance of Valeryans.
Most Awaited
I hope they include the moment the little prince Aemond gained his Dragon, Vhagar.  "I lost an eye but I've gained a Dragon"
Too funny. The tars are peel skined with white blond hair... yet the woknest that messed up the ending of got... is all over this show ..with people of color... you do not make black patterns a white man... or wonder woman a man... why are you messing with this?????
August 21st too long, I want it a few months ago
NO
LOOKS BETTER THAN RINGS OF POWER
oh god wow
Not interested! After the mess they did with GOT last episode! ending sucked! They should do a remake of the last episode not this!
Joan snow 🌨️
Oh myyyyyy
I can’t wait to watch the dance of diversity  and watch the black Targaryens rule. Fire and blood yeahhhhh
Is that Ramsey Boltons voice?
wow wow wow... this is gonna be epic.
THE HYPEEEE I MISS MY GOT FAM!!!
Umm, african american targaryen?
No one movies of HBO max release in INDIA it movies only remain in ENGLISH not in HINDI for indian people
Another chance to end the series in the right way
can it be august 21 already 😩
Am I the only one who watch and rewatch all over again this teaser ?
Unpopular opinion, I loved the entire show and thought the ending was great 🙈
Is it bad that I want to see this because of a white-haired Matt Smith?
Luckily GRR sat in on this and also has seen some of the episodes and he gave his stamp of approval 😈
Who are the black dudes with the horse sigil on their chest? Ive not read the books so just curious? There were no black ppl in westeros so have they cone over the Sea as a Targaryen ally?
After HBO betrayed and destroyed a fantastic series in the way they ended GOT, they really do have some nerve expecting that ex-fans are going to watch any spin off series/movies relating to it. No thanks i would rather watch grass grow.
I love dragon
You better not f*ck this up
A lannister always pays his debts
Wokeness is coming …
The voice over, its iwan rheon, right ?
i am so excited for this please don’t ruin it
The casting looks wack tbh.
I need the violence they put in the got
CANT WAIT! AUGUST 21 2022 MARKED DATE
*Black Velaryons, I'm out.*
August 21🔥🔥🔥
we wuz valyrians
Some black Valeryans... ok... sure
Bob marley with white hair
yes
I want assurance from HBO that if I invest my time watching this series the ending won't be horribly rushed and disappointing as with Game of Thrones.
Yeah it's coming on August 21
HBO did everything they could to get dumb and dumber to give game of thrones its proper conclusion. So im very optimistic they will do the series justice here. Assuming they dont fill it with sjw crap. So ill be tuning in unless i see itll be another political hand fisted dissappointment
I’m soooo excited 👏🏽👏🏽
Hope they do not ruin this one in the end 😂😈
Black skinned Targaryens, LOL
no dragon in the trailer, meh
21/08/2022
Wow😍🇳🇵
Can't wait a year between seasons again, don't make us wait so long.
I'm so excite <3 <3 <3
Tez vakitte Türkiye topraklarına da giriş yapmnız dileğiyle sevgili #hbomax
We all hated the ending, but look at us ,now we all are exciting for this 🤡😂😂😂😂
I can't wait
This isn't like getting back into a relationship with your ex. New show runners so it's more like hooking up with your ex's cousin
Please! I beg you! Dont let the writers ruin the show. I am holding my breath on this.
Game of Woke Return of the Disappointment
This Daemon Targeryen guy abilities looks much like Rhaegar the last dragon
Someone at work came up to me today and asked if i was excited for this. As a absolutely GOT nerd who rewrote season 7 and 8. I got no energy for this.
❤️❤️❤️
Waiting patiently!!! 🔥🔥
I’m so ready 💜
Nice, the Iron throne looks closer to the books. It would also be cool to have a series about the Doom of Valyria.
I wish this movie  realise in India
Geliyor gelmekte olan..🦄
I almost stopped watching Game of Thrones after Daenerys died. But her death is for the best anyway although it was painful. She's the main reason I stuck through the entire series. But I don't know why HBO wants to make a prequel 200 years before the iron throne, I think we've already been hinted enough of the Targaryen's past throughout GOT series.
Cöööoooppp
Except of last season,all others are really GOAT🐐
0:38 Another series for the garbage. Damn forced inclusion.
Great, HBO MAX... CAN'T GET IT IN THE U.K.
You killed GoT just let it rest in peace
Hindi dubbed please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Get ready for another Heart Breaker!!!! I know in this one with the civil war happening that all the dragons will be slaughtered.  Remember the baby dragon skull Jon found in the dragon pit?
AUGUST 21st! Woooo
'For Uganda' epic Targaryen line
21 de agosto chega logo
8/8/22🙌🏽🤐
Is this a tv show or movie?
With all this fire  We won’t to worry about a dark episode that we can’t see
It'll be like a marriage, start great then end terrible. Spending the following years missing the good times before divorce.
Yesssss!  Looking forward to it.
Isn't there kind of an inherent problem with prequels like this? I feel like a lot of the tension will be gone as you realize we already know what ultimately happens to the targaryens. So most of what happens just seems inconsequential.
Yeyeyey!!!
Everyone praised 10th Doctor's hair, now look at 11th! haha (Doctor Who reference)
5 seasons will be enough...no need to drag it till its tired....like the original series
I hope to see Littlefinger's ancestors in this series, because frankly, it wouldn't be suspenseful if there were no villains like Lord Baelish.
I get Chills everytime I hear Daemon’s heels in the dragon pit at the start can’t wait!
I hope they cast a hot Sir Duncan the Tall when that spin off is cast
This series is based on the Ancient Sumarians the Annunaki God's
I'm just going to watch it just for the dragons! o.O
21st of August is the Day guys... be prepared to burn. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
THE BLACKS AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
So ... I guess we get to see what Dr Who did on his off time while not having companions ^^
This show is gonna rule the world...
Black dude with platinum blonde hair. Stay woke Murica...
144 days till this drops 🔥🔥🔥
8/21 house of the dragon
I came again here after i saw the release date. See you on August 21 🤩
i’m ready for august 21st!! 🔥
Let’s hope they don’t eff up the ending to this one.
The date is set! August 22nd, 2022.
I CANT WAIT TILL AUGUST 21! AND GUESS WHAT ITS MY BIRTHDAY!
Game of Woke! 🤮🤮🤮
August 21st is still a long way off
House of the Dragon is coming to HBO Max in August 21, 2022.
Uncle vs Nephew. If you know You know
Maturity is when you realise that people are waiting for *HOUSE OF DRAGONS* just because of GOAT *GAME OF THORNS*
🥺 dragone ❤🌹
I actually voiced this trailer
When🥲????
Everyone should boycott this until Winds is released.
GoT is a ladder
It could premiere on April 17 like GOT did 11 years ago🤷🏽‍♂️ would be perfect
It would be nice if this was the Blackfyre Rebellion. But I worry about the final product.
Drop the trailer please
Trash like season 8
Drop the trailer CMON
Gods. Kings. Fire. Blood Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did
Jesus loves y’all ❤️
Will this be released in 4k?  Does HBO have anything in 4K TV wise?
Whats up with that black guy wearing an ash blonde wig ?
pls release the date and trailer
The first thing I checked was if D&D are writers again but I have VERY GOOD NEWS they are not involved at all 🥳🎉
I love the fact that we can hear the GOT main theme in the background and the Targaryen theme at the end ♥️ brings back a lot of memories
Sorry to be a hater, but I'm quite disappointed to see Matt Smith is in this.
I wish they could also do a series with House Martell, and their conflict with House Targaryen
Also if the guy in the opening is the mighty conqueror Aegon then yikes 😂
Who’s the family with dreadlocks? Lol
I don't want this fu*King House Of The Dragon or whatever, I need Winds of Winter. GRRM have cornered himself, and now he don't know what to do with characters
Plz, HBO.. Dont give this one to d&d
I’m excited to see how they play out Mushroom
No doubt, GoT is a good series hope they make more movies or Tv Shows to view the wonderful world of Westeros.
Will this be about the conquer of Aegon with his sisters? + Balerion the Black Dread?
It better be a good story because the actors are seriously FUGLY.
I miss GOT and cannot wait for a fix. Bring it.
Finally some black valyrians
6 months without anything
I'm not worried that this will turn out like GOT  S8 because GRRM already finished this story. Basically idiot proof lol
Trailer and release date please hbo
A man need to know about a man's ancestors of man by man of man where man is brought up by mans.
If somebody isn't beeping their sister I'm gonna be pissed.
The Velaryons weren’t black but ok
This will be better than rings of power mark my words
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16) ✝️
This looks promising.
parece que o trailer também vai demorar um ano p sair mds 😪
Dragon is comming
A TRAILER PLZZZZZ
Guess it’s finally time for me to start the series.
The universe of G.R.R.M is soo big and rich and yet you decided to make a show about elfs riding lizards !
Do not mess this up....please.
I cant tell you how many times I've watched this and every time I'm like a little kid on Christmas
Even the trailer soundtrack like a beast..!
Lance logo hbo aaa
Looks promising
Si
"200 years before the fall of the throne" uh, maybe physically... but there in fact still exists a King/kingdom (regardless how ridiculous the King is) and a process for when the King dies 👀
Drakarys🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nope nope nope.Excited just as much as for this new Lotr show
심장떨려 ㅁㅊㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Really wish we could’ve got the battle of the trident stuff with a prime Robert Baratheon
This sounds so much better with headphones.
WE STAN MATH SMITH!
Finally, more targaryens!
Team Targaryen 🐉
Wat prince Philip doin here
Thank Goodness
I’m rewatching “Game of Thrones” at this moment. Focus on replicating all the successes of the first 4 seasons above all, and there’s no way it can fail.
Ahahaha 🤣🤭 it's GAME OF WOKE! How pathetically comical 😎🗑️🔥.
Alright I'm just gonna ask what many will never dare to ask: is Milly Alcock one of those women passing as a white woman? We all know that has happened for real in life. Is this the case?
Don’t bother I’m done with got not to be disappointed again in the final episode
People who complains about D&D, the showrunners for this has done nothing of note just a bunch of the rock movies, enjoy
When will this start ?
You gonna say anything about your endings huh
How are you guys going to mess this one up?
Dont rush this like GoT was rushed by the previous producers.
Despite how bad s8 ended, i still have high hopes. Also good to see that there is not too much forced racial inclusion.
Should have done roberts rebellion!
Summer is coming not winter this time
Are the dark skinned ppl supposed to be targaryans how does that make sense, I believe in equality but it should be accurate to the book ,no?
Dreams didn't make Bran king, either. D&D did.
No Travis Fimmel. He would've made a terrific Targaryen.
Not going to lie. I hope this show crashes and burns. Costs HBO a boatload of money, and turns into a cautionary tale that freezes all ASOIAF "franchise" side projects.   Then George RR Martin can get back to finishing the goddamned books.
Watching this series about the Taragaryen's knowing only one left alive😢
Wait, I don't understand. Is it coming in 2022 or 2022? I can't tell from the trailer or your comment. Please confirm.
Is it by D&D again?
I would’ve preferred a series of Robert’s Rebellion.
I need it so bad 😭
Please
Now
Drop
The Reel Art
Its March no name of trailer no poster just theories imaginations and hopes that kept us alive till now  Trailers !!?
HELP so this series only cover the first 150 years of the dynasty ? just like the book ?
pov: you just watched Game of thrones for the first time, get obsessed with it, then find this
Hindi trailer...
Love GoT but hopefully the producers won't keep creating scenes where women are so keen to facilitate their own rape. With monotonous regularity women seemed to approach the idea of being stripped naked and assaulted, in crowded taverns, with some relish. It was cringeworthy and doesn't do anything to disavow the idea that the producers and writers have a rather perverted view of lower class women - or women in general.
trying not too kill my self and make it to see the show maybe things will get better not many things bring me joy
The trailer is coming on april and the show will be available on may
The Thing I'm waiting for the most is the Blue Ray Back story things they used to do! Thoes wer hella litt!!But they're only gonna have 150 years to play with instead of 300 like GOT witch means weak get more in depth looks of certain time periods in the Reign
I think this show is in good hands and will be good, George confirmed he was heavily involved in the prequel shows so I hope this show is amazing
Hey they at least got the throne to look like how it was described in the book. The trailer looks promising.
A friend said, "#GoTS8 made you wish you'd never watched any of it, ever." Very, true. Yet it was the greatest programme ever till S8 - I wonder if anyone could watch S1-7 and just stop, because that's probably ideal.
0:27 I bet #MillyAlcock, as the young version of a main character - #Rhaenyra - is barely in it, but they're using her as bait anyway.
I don't remember this episode of doctor who
I guess the Doctor really liked this time period and stayed. Hope the TARDIS doesnt get jealous
Here we go. Get ready for all the comments complaining about GOT.
What we need is a game of thrones game on the ps5 that is open world
Audiance : What about the season 8 remake ?  HBO Max : Not today !!
King in the north !!!
hurry up ffs
I think I saw Heimdall in the trailer
Well this is going to be G.     A.    Y.
GOT it.
Aegon II may have won the dance of the dragons, but Rhaenyra's and Daemon really won in the end. It was their bloodline, not Aegon's, who lived on through their son Visery's the II.
Now would be a great time to see what you did wrong in GoT, and learn from it...
I. CAN. NOT. WAIT!
Chills
Oh no, big mistake casting Matt Smith, the guy can´t act!!
I know people are worried this show will go the way of Game of Thrones, and while the final season may not have been what we wanted, I am in no way worried of how this show is going to go. Because we all have to remember that this is the prequel to Game of Thrones, meaning it can only do one thing: lead into Game of Thrones and do its best to honor it, and I have faith that it will. A few more months left to go, and we will be in the House of the Dragon.
hahaha more game of thrones?? but game of thrones SUCKED!! everyone hated it
Tommen Baratheon: Dreams didn't make me King, my brother's stupidity did
So Ned stark gonna be in this movie too?
I'm excited Damon will be much better than the shallow and cheldran Jon snow 🙄🙄
petition to get Olivia Cooke recast in House of the Dragon ! pls switch her
I was over Martin long ago but I may have to watch for Matt Smith.
Kat is jezabellah come get Angelina Jolie
This looks like another woke project to me.
Plss sir season 4 se sare season Hindi me kr dijiye🙏🙏🙏
I'm big fan from India of this series 😍😍🙏
Pls dubbed this series original Hindi language 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Hope we'll get the official trailer soon 🥺
I REALLY wish HBO was doing the LOTR too 😫😫 this looks so great! I’m so excited for house of the dragon, not so much LOTR 😫
They need not have to make this, if they didn't had ruined GoT's final season... Still thinks if any thing can be done to reshoot finale....     I would love to watch Got
We want Jon snow in the house of dragon
Gonna make a nice song remix 😌
Pls hurry I’m bored 😂
It looks like Amazon’s The Rings of Power is going to be a woke dumpster fire. At least I’ve got house of the dragon to look forward to. So pumped for some more Thrones
I still get pissed when I remember how GOT ended
Been watching it a thousand times
Is it me or after terrible season 8 i just don't care?
PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW PLEASE DONT BE SJW

Malayali ingg vaadaaa
Please tell me them black and blonde persons are from the Summer Isles
0:37 Remember when armour in GoT supposedly used to work like armour.
Буду смотреть только ради Мэтта Смита
Is this real?
Please launch in India
It looks intresting i realy hope it will be better than 7th and 8th season
WOW
Targaryen: dreams didn't make us king, dragons did Bran:  ...
I really hope we see a flashback of the old king Jaehaery's Targaryen. Bed ridden and dying with the young Alicent Hightower by his bed more than likely...still, that would be so cool to see the best Targaryen king ever, even if he's at the end of his life.
When someone asks you what happened here tell them THE NORTH REMEMBERS tell them Winter still dint came in THE SONG OF ICE and fire but DRAGONS CAME.
Never again, I learned my lesten.
Wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥
we need got season 8 proper climax. we need danariyas
House of incest
Oh HBO, aren’t you a glutton for punishment.
I’m putting my money on this show over amazon’s lotr.
I am so excited to see dragon's mother again. I am waiting ..
I am holy, I am rejecting evil.  I am rejecting evil comments.
200 years before the fall of GOT
Again with the damned Viserys wig.. EVERY male Targaryen sport this look???
DnD stay away from this right?
Woke
I was expecting dragons but i guess ill wait for the premiere. I hope it turns out good cos its source material is complete compared to GoT who went down the drain after season 6
they made the iron throne WAY better
See?? Im not mad there is diversity here... because it actually makes sense, but, if you would have put a black, asian or whatever targaryen, i would. Making reference of the new LotR series, and the Witcher
Momentum killer
so not a single character from the GoT series will be in here
This LOOKS SO GOOD
*Giving Vibes of Got From S01-S04*
Gosh so excited!!! But one detail I noticed was that the Targaryen sigil at the end of the trailer has four legs, but the one used in Game of Thrones has only two, and the dragons in that show match that description. Is the four-legs thing just a one off that was overlooked or will the dragons in this series have more limbs, in which case they could look a bit different from the CGI models we’re used to seeing on GOT, which would be nice since the colors of the dragons on the last show got really dull near the end of the show to the point where you couldn’t really tell which was which, and the colors of the dragons in the books are very vibrant and are often symbolic as well. They’ve changed the throne up a bit to be more accurate to the books so it’s not too wild of a thought. I’m even more excited to see them now 😅 Plz be good!! 🙌
DRAGONNNSSSSS
is this cancelled?
they better bless us with some great sword scenes of Ser Arthur Dayne or we Riot!
I hope HBO still give Emilia clarke performing “house of the dragon’’ because I love her performing  of mother of dragon
You know that feeling when you're watching something, like say for instance, footage of Hitler's regime,  anything  totalitarian or tyrannical.  1984, Handmaid's tail, Equilibrium to name a few.   Oppressive and controlling.   That's the same feeling I get just watching this teaser.   No thanks.
I feel like most people are so disappointed how G.O.T ended that this won’t draw as big of an audience. I personally won’t watch.
i hope you guys do a series of game of thrones future
😳😳😳
I need mother of dragon come back, i love her .she must be the queen
Rather than a pre-qual, how about remaking a season 8 that's actually good?
i hope it's better then game of thrones
When trailor is coming
Seeing this part of the book is sad because all the dragons and Targerians are in it... in GOT Daneryis is trying to rebuild this all on her own... she should had become the Queen with Jon.. regardles of the debate if she was bad or not.. is not like GoT ended up with a great King..
I really want to not be scared of this turning out the way GoT season 8 turned out.
It all started with Rickon ignoring the zigzagged strategy
Finally having  a black power family in this series .Excited !!!
HBO could've fire D&D and make more GOT seasons but they didn't cause they knew people would watch anyway and they wouldn't  have to waste more money on more seasons.  So remember they don't care about you, or the source material, they only care about money.
4K 🙏?
Yesssss
And in the last season you'll completely destroy the story? Like you did in Game of Thrones??? Can't wait...
O Doctor, My Doctor (well, not really. 12 is)
with all the source material there, I have high hopes. Hopefully it has the same production quality. The GoT writers were doing awesome when they had the source material to adapt.
I just want to see hi say burn them all!
Hello, I love the choice of including different ethnics in the Valyrian blood. Somehow, it reveals its greatness and grandeur : it was not the secret treasure of one dynasty, fragile, and doomed to disappear with the last heir of the latter. No. It ran through the veins of an entire continent, an empire that took over the world. The Valyrian blood remained constant through its diversity, like the original life force expressing itself in infinite ways. Now, we shall get to witness the stories of those once gifted with this power, mere men that could pretend to the title of gods. This, my friend, is most inspiring, do you not think ?
I just hope it is as good as GOT but with a better ending. They ruined the ending of GOT in my opinion.
These people are brave...
👍
I just wanna share HOTD also stands for highschool off the dead ,
Nice
A black duke in Bridgerton was already weird enough (seeing that dukes are usually direct descendants of the royal line being Caucasian. (Let's recall the role Johnny Depp played as a native american and everyone lost their minds lol, but they can corrupt our history no problem.)  Corlys, and his children, black actors? Stop it and grow some dignity, all black people. Learn to stand on your feet without needing to take over roles pale people should play in order to feel "included". Grow up. Goes to the whole world: take all the woke bs and walk. Time and place for everything, this was wrong.
When . .?
Everyone is ugly in this trailer. you can’t follow up Daenerys Targaryen with an ugly cast for her family. That’s unacceptable.
It's now Feb 19 2022.  White walkers are starting to melt.....  When are you going to release the dragons.... 😩
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Cmon APRIL !!!
0.18 there was a dragon head 😮
4 months later, I still want to know: how can I watch this in U.K. on release day, without vpn
First season of HOTD will be  top-notch considering their team's hardwork behind production and bringing most modren special effects  making every scenes involving this fire-breathing  beasts realistic.
Please figure a way to get Lena Headey back in this one
is like we all forgot GOT finale? :))
I really hope this series to have a beautiful opening song like GOT.
what month to launch the series?
Feel like this show will be cancelled very quick
so, what's the story of blacks in a predominantly white dynasty? is it just a holywoodisation trick or the original story actually involves people of color in the house Targaryen? btw i',m black before a bunch of idiots start slurring racism on me
Show looks awesome but let’s be honest we all know what happens to the targaryen bloodline and the dragons
🔥
#BringBackGOT
Please release in india and in indian languages also 🙏🏽❤️
Meh
Don’t mess it up, please 🥺
Time And Relative Dragons in Space....
Better Have Lots of Dragons and Dragon Fire Breathing Action
I just hope they don't rush this like they did with the last seasons of GOT
I'm Imagining a GoT themed graduation hat that says on top : "Dreams didn't help us graduate, desperation did"😆😆
Im speculating theres gonna be a black targaryen aswell,since we got black Anne Boleyn not long ago.
If D&D even has any slight participation in this I will dip out
I may be in the minority but I liked season 8 … …                  Just kidding, it was awful :P
Still waiting 😴
I'll be cautiously awaiting
Just know that no matter what happens in this series ultimately we know how it ends so none of this matters.
I can't wait
Зло не может создать ничего нового, оно может только испортить и разрушить то, что изобрели или сделали добрые силы». - Дж. Р. Р. Толкин
Id rather watch this than the new lotr series
This year is amazing
"El mal no puede crear nada nuevo, solo arruinar o corromper lo que las fuerzas del bien han inventado o construido" J.R.R. Tolkien.
Where is the trailer
Burn them all
interested in this mostly because matt smith is great casting for daemon and the lack of d&d's involvement. could be pretty sick, hope it turns out good.
Can't wait 🔥🔥🔥
Say what you want, this show is going to be better then lord of the rings tv show
Just finished watching Game of Thrones, and just in time!
Was so hoping for something during the Super Bowl
wild !
seriously when are you coming to europe with hbo max...
I had no idea HBO was about to drop this...I jumped out of my couch when the trailer started...HBO better make this right after GOT finale debacle
I JUST WANNA SEE BALERION    !!!!!!!!
Really excited about seeing The Black Dread on screen 😌😍
Wooow
This is the actual show I'm waiting on for 20202. LOTR is not up to this quality.
Yüzüklerin efendisinin fragmanını gördükten sonra buraya geldim  ve şükür dedim Hbo sen bu işi biliyosun 🦄
Much better than rings of power
Amazon, look at this trailer and try to learn something.
I still can't wait for it I'm so hyped
The atmosphere that lotr has to be is this trailer. They ruined lotr but we have GOT, we have HOD AND HODOR
So what book do I need to read before I watch this series?
(Insert season 8 joke)
its only a matter of time
And now our watch begins
Please I need it bit by bit, take your time and make the movie worth my time!!.
I really hope that this show can live up to the high bar that the first 5 seasons of G.O.T has set. We all know that the acting performances on thrones were at a very high level and if House of the Dragon can come close to half of that it should turn out to be a awesome series! Ever since Thrones ended I've had a t.v. drama void that needs to be filled!
It's 2022, I'm waiting.
When exactly does this come out?
Did anybody see how the dragon sigil in the flames was gold instead of black? That’s the personal sigil of aegon II targaryen, taken after his golden dragon sunfyre
Black Targaryen... I am done
Honestly… there most likely will not be any white walkers. And the plot is very narrow. I’m not sure about this one
Multiracial Targaryans?  Oh boy….
We need a new House Of The Dragon Trailer !!! Please !!!
We need a new House Of The Dragon Trailer !!! Please !!!
Whoes the aego. Here
I'm looking forward to it...
If Nina Gold didn't do the casting, I already have doubts about it
Not going to watch it after that mess of an ending
*200 years before Game Of Thrones butchered its finale.*
Wow, many GOT simp fans defending the trash last season. Typical.
I bet they will ruin these show too 😅
Give us full trailer now
Meh.
Looks good, but I'm afraid that the story will be messed up again like Game of Thrones. The ending just threw everything into extreme confusion without any transformation of the characters.
Which Date release .
A man should be in this series
S1: Slow paced and great dialogue between Characters S2:Still amazing and some interesting dialogue and a couple twists S3:We got to see how life beyond the wall was and some more of Daenerys, And the "Red Wedding" S4: Some people think this was the last good GOT season, Tyrion and Arya get some amazing Character development , Joffrey drinks some quality wine, Ramsey and Theon spend some 'bonding' time together. S5: This where I think GOT started going down in quality, Tommen becomes king, Cersei's prophecy about her children, Arya arrives in braavos and enters the house of black and white, Stannis gets done dirty by D&D S6:Euron, Sam Tarly gets Character development, Daenerys gets a Dothraki Horde, bran becomes the 3 eyed raven, Cersei kills half the cast in the sept of Baelor, Battle of the bastards didn't make much sense but was a epic battle scene, Ramsey feeds his dogs. S7:Arya kills most of the Freys, the white walkers march to the wall slowly, Daenery attacks the Lannister army Bronn saves Jaime from being a idiot, Daenerys arrives at Dragonstone, S8:Ohhh boy here we go,Jon and daenerys go to winterfell with 3 dragons, Unsullied and the dothraki horde. Sam tells jon he's a Targaryen, "The Long Night" which made even less sense then the battle of the bastards. Arya kills the night king even though he could have easily snapped her neck. Brienne gets knighted by Jaime, Gendry gets legitimized by Daenerys, Daenerys sets sail for kings landing and somehow gets ambushed by a huge fleet which results in one of her dragons dieing, Jon doesn't want it. Varys dies sadly, Daenerys easily destroys the iron fleet and most of kings landings defences, The city rings the bells signaling surrender but Daenerys goes crazy for no reason and destroys the Geneva convention by razing Kings landing to the ground,The hound saves Arya's life ,Then he confronts his brother The Mountain and they fight and it looked like The Mountain was going to win until The Hound pushes the mountain off the tower/castle into the fire ultimately killing both of them. Cersei and Jaime are finally reunited and embrace each other and as Jaime sees the keep collapsing on top of them he comforts her before they are crushed, Tyrion finds them crushed. Daenerys proclaims she will liberate the entire world,Tyrion resigns as hand of the Queen and is imprisoned for treason. Jon follows Daenerys into the Red Keep to the throne room and before she is able to even sit down on the iron throne she is confronted by Jon who after they embrace stabs and kills her. Drogon then realizes what's happened and almost kills Jon but at the last moment redirects his anger at The Iron Throne melting it, then he picks up Daenerys body and flies away with it. Then for some reason Bran is proclaimed king of the six kingdoms six because the North was proclaimed a independent Kingdom and appoints Tyrion as his hand, Jon is sentenced to the Nights watch, Tyrion reorganizes the small council consisting of Bronn,Brienne,Davos and Sam, PODRICK IS FINALLY KNIGHTED.Sansa is proclaimed queen in the North, Arya sets sail west of Westeros, Jon rejoins tormund and Ghost at castle black who go beyond the wall in the last scene signaling the end Of A Game Of Thrones.   Sorry for my spelling, and btw this is in no particular order.
Can't help to think that's the voice of Richard Madden.
Hopefully we could see more giants and the children of the forest in action I feel like they didn't get enough attention in GOT
The trailer pleaseeeeeeee
Have a feeling they are gonna go woke and ruin this can already see it in the casting
its 2022 just Bring it -  watched  G.O.T  again lost count how may times since the last  .
This is so darkish
Nc
that DRAGONS DID woooooooow
I would prefer to see the 8’th season of GOT. Still waiting for it.
I stopped watching GOT after Season 1 Episode 5. It was just to disgusting and boring. So much talking and too much grows scenes.
Mi socio HBO presente para darles entretenimiento al estilo wayne company
Where is the trailer hbo
I cant wait any longer
The throne covered in blades left me with shivers.
Откуда, мать вашу, негры в роду Таргариенов?
There better be Martial Arts 🤪😜🐲🐉🐲
When is coming ?
0:18 have any one sawn it perfectly there was dragon skull
I don’t like established actors in these roles. It just dosent have the same vibes as GOT
"Dreams didn't make us king. Dragons did!"
Is it coming or not??? Is it truly cancelled???🥺🥺
Sasa role should be cut ,her role is not impressive at all
I hope there will much less penises... 🤔
"WE WUZ VELARYONS 'N' SHIET"
Can't wait
So “dark” Targaryens…I predict the movie will fail. Thank God Game of Thrones was filmed on time…
Hey can you see my message?
I think this show will be great like GOT other than season 8
When it is coming.......
Finish it before 8th season...
‏متى بتكون هذي المنصة ف الشرق الاوسط 😭
Can't wait yo 🔥🔥🔥
الفخامة 🤩👌
*I wachted* it proceed.
toss a coin to your witcher
Spin offs are usually triky because of horrible casting  Very few endup being awsome but if they hit the Jack pot with casting the roles then definitely it will be awsome
Hopefully we could see more giants and the children of the forest in action
Any updates?

Miss Game of Thrones so much!! I hope this is good.
I am still a bit leery of this… Because that previous ending was so damned bad.
the only thing lack here is: a beautiful actress!
I hope the series doesn't ...Drag-on!
I hope the series doesn't ...Drag-on!

Dear Eve Best, for the sake of our sanity, stop hiding please
SPOILER- Bran becomes king
Looks like another masterpiece on the way
For anyone wondering HBO has cancelled it after a $30m pilot episode
Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did that line alone is better than all serie of money hiest
Matt... Oh my love, you were the Doctor now you're being reduced to a Targaryen I hope this is good otherwise Matt's gonna ruin his career
I really like the Aegon II's golden dragon an 00:53, really nice touch
When it will be released ?🙋🏼‍♂️
while I understand the mixed feelings about the attempts at inclusion and diversity, making the Valaryons chocolate skinnded, I think the Princess looks a bit blonde Asian as well, this is all good because in George RR Martin's world, there seems to be a number of cultures and ethnicities. The writing and the shows helped me understand a few things about our world as well, so shout out to the producers for this attempt.
Can t wait omg 😱 I am big fan 💙💪🏆👑👑🙏 best serie ever 🇩🇿💙
End of January. Now there should be an actual trailer.
As long as D and D aren’t a part of it I’m good
Waiting to see Ned Starks father Grenade Stark
The pressure is probably immense, but please TRY to redeem the mess that was  GoT finale.
Are we there yet? 😬
Unfortunately this reminds me way more of Season 8 GoT than Season 1-7 GoT. Also not sold on Matt Smith.
it’s just not the same :(
200 years? so no Aegon's Conquest?
Lol look at T-5000 traveling back in the past 😂
Why’d they cast a Frankenstein looking dude as Daemon Targaryen?
0:29 i find her more attractive than Daenerys
This is going to be good, can’t wait!!!!!
It's really interesting to see house targaryen in this show  after seeing what a only one of  (Daenerys )them  did in game of thrones
Game of thrones Hindi dub please 🥺
Please upload in Hindi language
Please release it asap we are waiting so badly
its already been cancelled
Release the official date already  😩😩
Me Watching : It's a cool show  Every Targaryen in this show that i'm watching : it incest time !!!
#Dracarys
I like the new trailer for the movie "Coming to America"
It should have been started with aegon
best actress
Corlys was not portrayed as being black in the books. Why the change?
Everytime a Targaryen is born, the Gods toss a coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.
hmmmmmm, nah, that's cool I'll pass. But thanks anyway for trying.
This just triggered me to rant to my little sister about season 8 for an hour
Probably not gonna happen but I would like to see Robert's rebellion and him and young Ned fighting together at least at the end of this series
Still think that the Stark and Night king backstory series would have been better.
200 years before the worst finale in history
My heart says no but my body is saying yes......
After the mess that Game of Thrones became. Is anyone actually excited to see this?
This will be red dwarf all over again lol
cant wait to watch it
I CAN'T WAAAAIT
Everyone is gonna be so critical of this show because of the last season 😂
Jldi aao yaar ab
Hindi dubbed please
"Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin and the world holds its breath" -Barristan Selmy
New trailer please🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
So me a dragon bro idc about the incest albinos I'm here for dragons
Count me in
Hopfully this has better writing then season 6-8 of the GOT. Still can't watch the last season without feeling sad and angry at how the butcherd it to rush it out to start on star wars........ which meant star wars cancelled their contract because who wants directors who throw a decades worth of work out the window to get onto the new bigger thing faster.
Wish I was a writer in the original GOT! That ending was bad! I would have made John fight the night king in a epic battle, then when D was killing everyone in the city have Arya fight another epic battle with grey worm in the city while it’s going down after she took down some unsullied, then cerci face to face small fight with Dany and dany picks up a kitchen knife and kills cersi, then John kills dany like he normally did but when the dragon ends his screaming and he drakaris john and he sees john don’t die but his hair turned white after that and the dragon then kneels and let’s John climb him and they venture off to the soldiers, and he says what he did and tells everyone who he really is! And they all kneel and end it with john and his family together and he’s on the throne sitting like he doesn’t want it but the crown on his head and his white hair braided!   Damn I should have written this ending
Got ending was so bad, I don't know if I'm ready to go  through that same again. Also we already know targaryens dynasty won't last long, I don't find anything good from that show
Can't wait!
New trailer please
I love this show because it reflects who we really are, get rid of the police, the law and all kind of order in our civilization and we would have a world exactly like Game of Thrones except for the giants and dragons and white walkers of course 😂 but the point is that our nature is violent and killing is as easy as breathing once the circumstances are right for it.
Background sound like ramsy bolton
I want to see about Roberts and balon grejoys rebellion with young Ned in it
At what channel we can see
Does this mean we'll see Melisandre? I mean the woman is what 400 years old?
I hope this also has a great cast as the GOT
This is going to be epic :-)
Wanna gather people who doesn't hate the season finale 😂
Hermoso y glorioso
Uff
THE NORTH REMEMBERS!
What…? I really thought this would be about the mad king and around that time… damn..  and why does there seem to be a black targaryan and a random asian girl? I dont mind different cultures in this series but please game of thrones… dont do it just for the sake of it. GoT series is built around old England, dont go away from that.
More sjw crap 👎🏻 Westeros is a reference of Medieval Europe that is NOT multicultural! Stop destroying the medieval culture
Remeber D&D denied GOT 4 more seasons just so they can hurry into Disney. An HBO let it happen. In my view both are complicit in GOT's death.
Listen people gotta get over how bad the ending was, it’s not good for anyones mental health to keep beating that dead horse
How are they going to make it seem like 200 years before GOat I really wonder technology would be so much different no?   I just feel like they won’t bother with those important details
I hope from the bottom of my heart that young Ned Stark (absolute badass, based on the books) and Robert Baratheon will take a proper part of this prequel. God bless!
Yeah, they completly destroyed series ending, and made first prequel so bad, that they themselves killed it right away.  So no real expectations on my side.
hahaha i knew they'd blackwash the characters, i knew they would is this an amazon trailer or what?
Doctor?
Shutakeo. Totoo ba? Matatapos ko na GOT. ayusin nyo decision nyo sa buhay HBO
I know its not him but the narrator sounds so much like robb stark.
What thaaaa
This can’t be as bad as “just like that” on HBO.
Florida winter last longer than Game of Thrones winters
When the new trailer is coming.. I can't wait..
*Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did *  Bran stark: 👁👄👁
“Dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did” THE SHADE OF IT ALL! I can’t wait
this show is gonna be epic
Just don't get D&D to write it.
Looks really good...When will this start in 2022?
Between this and Amazon's Lord of the Rings TV Series, 2022 is looking like a good year for TV. People are hungry for medieval/fantasy, it's like gold in today's day and age.
AHHHHH DANKE BRUDER
The prequel to the greatest show in the world, Lets hope its half as good as GOT

I am super exciteeeed 🤩🤩
TARGARYENS ARE BLACK??? LMAOOOOOO  JUST ANOTHER BLACKWASHING AND WOKENESS TV SHOW!!!
Some statistics of this comment section:   1% random stuff 9% hype comments 90% RELEASE HINDI DUBBED (PLEASE)
So, if this happens 200 years prior to the fall of the Throne, Melissandre would be alive in this one as well since it is believed that she is around 400 years old. I hope they bring her back. I loved Carice Van Houten's performance ❤
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!! I'M WAITING FOR IT!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Where’s blood and cheese?? 😏 👿
Please God, don't let them go woke and completely ruin this series!
Powerful
Niggasssss
Whennnnn
You know that you could've spent all this money to remake season 8 with competent writers, right?
HOUSE OF THE WOKENESS!!!!!!
THE BLACKWASHING DESTROY EVERYTHING!
Came to see dragons but 😂
This is right on time! I just finished the last 2 seasons of GOT and I was feeling empty . . .
Who cares its just a spinoff. The main thing didnt end well so this one will never reach the hype game of thrones had. Its gonna be fun to watch tho.
black targariyen niceeee
okay, lets not throw 8 years of character development **laughs in GRRM**
Hindi dubbed plz
season 8 will be a disaster
Spark is gone if the GOT finale didn't burn me i'd be more hyped
not me watching this again and again for the 100th time  release the trailer already!!!
Just don't F*ck up the ending.. Oh that's right, GOT takes place after all of this anyway so the ending is ruined anyway..
I read somewhere that Balerion the Black Dread might not show up in the series. Thanks Dum and Dummer.
Man, imagine devoting an entire series to the message that absolute power corrupts absolutely and brings nothing but misery to everyone else, rather than cramming it all into the last season.
All we wanted was another season of GoT….
Good thing I don't have HBO Max. Because this crap will never pass my screen ever.
Am I the only one that is not hyped about this?
Can't we please start petition to have their digital artists purple the eye this time round
at least D&D aren’t involved in this project and it’s in the hands of people who actually worship GOT and GRRM’s world. don’t let season 8 give you a pre-conceived idea on what this show will be like, i’m sure it’ll be amazing
Is it going to release in early 2022 or mid or in end of 2022?
Why i sense the narrator is Ramsey Bolton?
Ehh prefer the Long Night but I guess 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️…………… gonna b ALOT of incest in this one ppl 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
These people look too pale, thin-haired sickly to be dragons.
Please don't be House of Woke
House of the Woke!!!
Let's see how badly they butcher this one 🤣  " you die you die everybody die " 🤣🤣
Well done, now I hate Game of Thrones and I used to love it you know. What a shame...
That's voice of Ramsay Bolton

I am excited for this but please don't ruin it like the last season of GOT. Was the best show ever and had the worst ending.
Ironically,  the source material is still unfinished 🤣🤣🤣,  typical GRRM CLIFFHANGER 😉
200 years back or 2000 years back... Not interested in watching as we know all this is gonna end up with bran the broken in the iron Throne.. Oops wheel chair throne...
I just want every producer out there to know-it's okay to actually fund/allow/come up with NEW ideas for tv shows and not just a bunch of remakes and spinoffs.
This season 8 remake trailer still looks off.
When’s it come out
After the tragedy of season 8, I had only one condition for House of the Dragon: Ramin Djawadi
I felt cheated at got finale when my dragon queen died so i'm looking forward to the ruthlessness of the dragon kings. xoxo thank you for making it happen.
Everyone deserves a second chance to clean up their mistakes. Even you HBO.
The only reason I'll watch this is because I love Matt Smith
Say what you all want, but we all know, if they released another 5 series with the GOT storyline, everyone here would watch every single one of them (everyone that isn't some random person who came across this series).
Ending music is a reference to the Daenerys Targaryen theme from GoT if you listen closely
Ready for another trailer!
The equivalent of a 2am text from an ex
Gents, if she cheats on you once, do you take her back without her apologising?  HBO didn’t even say sorry for GoT final season man
I will not get pulled back into a toxic relationship. Nope lol. 🗣booo🍅🍅🍅🍅!
Can't wait....❤
When is the realease date?...
All dragons are dead at the beginning of game of thrones … just saying
Something i'd like to see: Westeros in more modern times. Something like the victorian era or 1700s. What kind of goverment do they have, still a monarchy? A presidential one? A parliamentary monarchy? Do they have colonies? Did (Arya) they discover new territories? Dragons still exist? Is the north and south still two different kingdoms or they united again? I hope GRRM writes something like that someday.
I really hope we see my favourite boy Vermithor there
What's the point of watching the beginning, even if it's a masterpiece, after knowing that it was finished with a disgraceful ending just so the Starks could win?
yess! cannot wait!
👎👎👎👎
Love from india
Can't wait holding my breath this the  series could bet GOT
Vhagar vs Caraxes over the the God's Eye - this series's Red Wedding   Don't look that up (spoilers!) Or do and actually read the book -- that's what I'd recommend, honestly
Is it Ramsay Bolton's voice?
Not sure if I should touch this with an 8ft ole based off GOT season 8...
they can make a million spinoffs but it will never be compared to game of thrones. by far the greatest show of all time nothing will compare to the joy i felt watching all 8 seasons but i have high hope for this spinoff
Bring Emilia Clarke back!
Excellent cast, I'm sure this series won't disappoint.
HADİ ARTIK LÜTFEN
When will the movie House of Dragons be shown?
just 7 seasons this time please
After how GoT was squandered I'm actually not interested in anything that are not the books. From the simple fact that I know how it ends even if this prequel is great it will always end with the tragedy of season 8
Waiting for it as never before 🎇
Waiting For Ya…. 🥀
if GOT is incest. This one is much much worse LOL
Actually guys, I enjoyed the last season of GOT. How would you end it? Everyone got what he deserved, John Snow betrayed Queen for the higher good, dragons ruined Kings Landing. That's it, isn't it?
How it ends: "And who could be a better dragon than Bran the Broken?"
Looking forward to it!
Damage control.
vALAR mURGULES !
@HBO Yeah, Yall can go fly a kite. I'm actually surprised you decided to make a new show instead of just scrapping season 8 and doing re shoots.
So Rob Stark was a Targaryen, ok.
"Yeah, I know we had some bad times, but she's changed now!"
What a waste of money. No one is going to watch this crappy series.
This show will be nothing but a great disappointment.
Cringe blackwashing also literally the worst character you could of possibly swapped to black considering how important his bloodline is 😂
please announce a fixed date for House of the Dragon😕
Every time a Time Lord is born, the gods flip a coin
"Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did." Yes, but no, both!  Dreams and dragons made the Targaryens kings
Whateer GRRM wrote in the book, you can be sure the director will subvert it by season 8 with a woman of colour at the helm
The blackwashing is already making it a 0/10
Well...I'm.defenitely going to try to get into this series..
A trailer is good. It gives a man pleasure to watch.
Fecha porfavor
Is Ramin Djawadi the composer?
The return of Doctor Who!
GoT fu*ked us once with season 8. I will not invest my time with this prequel. NO THANK YOU!!!!  I will invest my time with Fear of The Walking Dead(FTWD) on AMC and Black Summer on Netflix.
OMG OMG OMG OMG IM DO EXCITED
This trailer does not inspire
Over GoT, it'll just turn into another platform for them to shoehorn some identity politics into.
Watching GOT recently made one thing very clear. The shows that have followed in its wake (The Witcher, Wheel of Time, Shadow & Bone) are not even in the same league. GOT casting, writing, directing, character development, storytelling are all vastly superior. Hope this spinoff is close.
I still don’t get why they cast a black man as Corlys, and Im actually black.
Me: Hey mom can we stop for Game of Thrones on the way?  Mom: No we have Game of thrones at home  *The game of thrones at home.
black valyrians... looks like this series will be as logicly coherrent as season 8
I've watched Game of Thrones like 5 times and I'm  obsessed with it and now 2 months later I see there's a spin-off. How tf did I miss this😂
It should’ve been  “House of the Dragons” considering book readers……
Going to watch it, likely enjoy it....without...any....acknowledgement...of....toxic....fandom.
How many seasons do we have to wait before you destroy this one too?
This looks like its going to be better than the first. i dont even watch season 8 because it was so badly written
Yo espero que no sea un disparate como la otra.... Aunque no creo que hay sentido en ese tipo de serie... Nos dan algo del pasado cuando ya sabemos el final.
Y’all the source material is laid out for this series, stop bringing up s8. George rr Martin even admitted that he should’ve kept up with the books.
Yes
It's 2022 now  And  no release date yet  😭😭😭
I didn't think they were going to let all of that movie making expertise languish. Hopefully the next one will be even better.
Hope we are gonna see more knife tricks...
So is this show happening or cancelled? Still does not have an air date.. and all searches lead to a cancellation?  Someone set us straight please...
As long as it ends in season 6.....
is this it ! ?  the start of the madness !
"Dreams didn't make us Kings! Dragons did!"
Oh man, I can't wait to not watch this.
watching this once a day until premiere.
maybe it will help me to understand what is happening with you 😜
I loved season 8 wtf are you all talking about???
should be Traphouse of the Gibbon
Well, its 2022 now🥂
Greyjoy voice
Hard pass
Matt's voice tho 😍😍😭
Will harren the black be in it
You think you can bait me with Matt Smith??? I have not forgotten the season that shall not be numbered!!!
I see diversity in the cast , So 200 years before there was Black and Asian women in westeros , And after 200 years they'll all disappear
HOLY COW YESSSSSSSS THANK YOU 🙏
Why bother? If you want to get this franchise moving again you need to re-do season 8.
yo im not gonna lie this looks pretty epic
This series will be mad
Can't wait 😍😍😍
The lanistesters send their regards
People are bashing this show in the comments like they're not going to watch it!!!! I loved GOT regardless of the season finale. I think they were smart to go the opposite direction than what people expected because at the end of the day that's life. Prince charming doesn't always get his fairytale ending. People need to move on!!! And if you exclude the last episode of season 8 it was an AMAZING season.
Woke bs probably
Based on true story
D&D destroyed the series for me, I won't be able to enjoy anything else from the shows if the ending was THAT bad...
The real king comes back
Afrikan Blacks who play them realy thats realy authentic Guys ^^ would be the same if Whites played in Afrika Roles that would be fcking stupid pls dont mess up Stuff like this!!
Are dragons confirmed in this series? I sure hope so
Fool me once.....
Where are the dragons?!
Twd > got
with mr smith in this too bad ms coleman doesnt make an appearance that would have been awesome
Back again still waiting for the Official Trailer!!!!!!
You know nothing jon snow.....
I'll stick with the witcher...
Don't worry, this one won't last 8 seasons.
After they train wrecked this franchise...
Not even sure I can watch this after Game of Thrones season 8.
Cant wait man cant wait
''an hbo origional series'' doesnt even make sense
i rather enjoyed the last season of thrones. caught me off guard
Starring the 11th Doctor.
Finalmente tá chegando 2022 🙏🙌
Yes
Yes
They just gonna F it up in the end like the last one..... i'm gonna pass
Winter is coming…in like 200 years so. All good.
Hype trailer. Still under the shadow of seasons 7-8.
A series resides where a series believe it resides. It's a trick. A shadow on the wall. And a very small series can cast a very large shadow.
hope they dont let those 2 hacks near this....
The Witcher with its nowadays popular agenda is failing so is the wheel of time.. HBO please make a good adaptation without just focusing on quotas of diversity, anti family propaganda etc
So many good unfinished stories you could have told. The fall of Valeria, the conquest of Westeros, or the Long Night. But, no, The dragons were a real draw, so let’s make 14 more! Then tell a story everyone who watched the show knows 👎
My goodness the suspense is killing me
WHEN?
They presented this teaser very casually as if everyone knows the story..
We need the long night prequel!
isso é magnífico, Fogo e Sangue 🔥🔥🔥
Please Tamil dubbed HBO Max🙏
People say the last season was bad, I think the last 2 episodes were bad we all except Jhon aka (Aegon) to take the throne instead he returned to the watch as if they didn’t makr peace with the free folk or kill every walker
Again it will be not based on the book which already 😞 sucks!!!
I’m so ready. I have watch the game of thrones 5 times all seasons. This is going to be awesome 👏🏽
Looks promising. But I just won't invest like I did  The North Remembers.
completed all 1 to 8 series in 15 days during 2021. it was nice series
Bring it on!,,,,, so ready.
I'm crying hahaha
The only thing that can ruin this show is good old virtue signalling. With all due respect, but i don't want to see a black Targaryan or an Asian northerner.
Am I the only person who appreciates the final GOT season? I thought the way the characters were portrayed in the last season was consistent with their development during the show ... I would prefer a season 9 over these spin offs ...
I love house targaryan this series will be amazing 👏
Directed and produced by D&D
its reaaalllyyy happening
Is that Ramsey talking? Lol
Cannot wait !
So are there just no attractive people in the UK or did they just round up randoms from the bus station? The blonde black dude is particularly hilarious, that hair really distracts the viewer from the Kunta Kinte under it and lets them believe those characters are related…
I like how their technology didn’t evolve at all 200 years later in GoT
Iron Throne looks worse somehow. Just do the towering version from that concept art! Why do it halfway?
Yesssss!! More!!!
Not very informative.
I thought The yellow haired man was a witcher
Wasn't this shelved?
woke
I honestly don t know if I should watch this... this brings on a lot..
HBO just couldn't help themselves. Gotta check those boxes!
So from what books is this story came from???? Tell me guys I want to read it. 🙏😇
the audience remembers
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
House of the Dragon, I call it house of incest
I will watch it, except the last season
People who wanted a “happily ever after” ending to GOT clearly never understood the show.
Seriously?? Who would trust HBO after the way they ended GoT? Definitely will NOT be watching, Sorry Not Sorry.
Dear DnD "Dreams didnt make GoT a good show, good writing did"
There is no real plot other than small summaries but the show runners should’ve went back to the original Aegon story which would’ve been epic.
Ill watch for Matt Smith
I hope this series does not jump the shark
I hope they explore the main families and not just focus on the special tickle time family
its a useless show we already know what happend in the future
And it’s black people in this one 🙌🏽
Matt Smith is always fun to watch. Can't wait 😍
Omg
YO AM I FKN HYPE
So, are we gonna see Robert Baratheon's rebellion in this??
Bran the crippler was best in got
Regardless of GOT season finale, the show was undoubtedly good -if not amazing. I bet this will be better if not just as good. MOAR DRAGONZ
Not gonna lie ....this looks good 👍
Oh ini? Gampang ngurusnya. Yg susah itu bukan ini.
Season 8 of GOT left me in such distaste that i didnt realize a trailer for this dropped until now
I don't know, though.  I remember before the final season finding out that there would be a prequel and getting excited.  Now, I just don't know.  I think I'll wait and see.
HBO... you get one more chance... But don't mess this up
👏👏👏
is this still a thing or was the one with Naomi Watts completely different?
They canceled this
We Wuz Kangz GoT edition.
We want Robert's Rebellion #HBOMax
When your old ex be like 'lets get back together again ...and you fall right back into their arms as if nothing happened
Will be available in Hindi?
The Doctor certainly has his hands full again it seems lol
Tyron Lannister: lo disfruté con este tráiler
A new crop of "unique" baby names
Can't BEAR to WAIT
All I beg is that they don’t kill of Matt Smith anytime soon
We’lcmo back thrones
I HATE ENDING GAME OF THRONES
Don't let Benioff and Weiss anywhere near this and I'll watch.
So excited
I cant wait love the fire &bloood 😍
Don’t forget! Audience remembers…
0:39 a black targeryan ? Not that I have anything against black people but come on that doesn't make any sense you could've made a black house or something
Plz release it's official dubbed in hindi
Just amazing 🔥
Can't wait to see this series. HBO is the best.
Is this real
Better than the netflix feminist

It's cancelled by HBO
We want the tráiler plsssss

Indonesian waiting this movie launching... G.o.t the best tv series in the world
Iam still waiting for house dragonz
Jumping on my back windows with the spike
Ahhh il get the house house house house..
Why was this cancelled man
Cancelled lol
I know I'll regret coming back to this 8 seasons later but I can't help it
I wait something unexpected from this show which will be themely connected to Game of Thrones. Please try to prolong this show for 200 episodes or maybe more ).
😘😘😘
Fights and flashy CGI did not make GOT good. The characters stories did. This looks bad
GoT S1: Winter is coming S2: Winter is coming S3: Winter is coming S4: Winter is coming S5: Winter is coming S6: Winter is coming S7: Winter is coming S8: Winter came and left in 30 minutes…
Oh I can't wait for this
It's been CANCELLED people! They built us up to break us down! Just like season 8! HBO and it's cruelty knows no bounds
Hbo cancele this but still offers it for subs WTF
Am i the only person who actually wanted to see what happens to bran the broken and The rest of the Starks left standing ?
Whem will house of dragon release? Please reply
I m waiting
I’ve been considering reading the GOT books before watching the show. Should I?
aegon was already dead 200 year ago💀
*WE WUZ DRAGONZ AN SHIEET*
WE
Why did they ended like that way they cloud do the Denerys will be revived by the priests of red god and go for her revange or something like that.
i wanna be a character bro, so bad! they were filming in a village next to me but they wouldn't give me a part :(
Game of Thrones in Telugu dubb plzz
Yesssssssssssssss !!!!!!!! 🔥 🔥
Dislike.
All the whiners here posting about how bad season 8 was, yet will be front and center for the new Thrones 😫😫😫.  BTW, season 8 was great.
متحمس
Came back waiting for the official trailer.
HBO has flipped another coin here, lets hope it lands right this time. Condal is a competent writer whos knows and loves the books & lore. This gives the show an advantage to counter the disadvantage of the source material having virtually no dialogue or character development.
This Time Iron Throne is closer to books .. anyone noticed??
Plot twist. It canceled 🤣
🔥🔥
I cannot wait!
First this now halo...I don't have enough drop pods for this.
At least Release in hindi language also plz 😑
No Dragon on House of The Dragon
0:35
Make a movie of Roberts rebellion
𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐀𝐋𝐋𝐘 😍
*sighs* opens hbo...
this is going to be terrible, I hate to say
Spank me, dragon mommy.
Loling at all the whiners and criers in these comments.
don't f00k it off
This has been cancelled
Are you telling me to see the 200 year ago history... Just to see bran on the Iron Throne
Dragon is coming
Remakes last season  games of thrones
IM SO READY
To heck with the show... I can't wait for the title sequence.
South Park: Dragons are coming and it's gonna be awesome...
I will cry at the end, after reading the book i know it will be sad
You all cut to many corners in the last episodes of GOT, messing up my orgasmic feelings. So, while you at it,  remake it to more thorough and not some *jump off* piece that only lasted 2 minutes. I'm not a *quickie type fan.* I'm here for the looonnnng run.🏃‍♂️ run.
in article they said there will be over 17 dif dragons in season 1
Are we going to see Balerion the black dread????? Plz
I wil not watch it if there is no Direwolf in the series
Is this based on jessica cluess books of house of dragons and war of dragons?
They should all have purple eyes.
Is this the one they said they've cancelled??
Not sure if I can commit to a new GOT series after season 8, in fact season 8 has put me off all TV series not completed.
Targaryen then: "Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did." Targaryen now: "I dun wan it."
Tension mat lo HBO walon ka series masterpiece hota hai
S8 ruined GOT for me... I hope this makes up for it....
Where is the Dragon?
After reading through the comments I feel people should make their own shows and give it the ending they want
I learned the hard way with Game of Thrones. I learned the Lore. everything. all for nothing. I will not waste my time on Starwars 1-3 if episodes 4-6 were garbage.
This is to know everyone that news everywhere that prequel  cancelled is actually about 2019 pilot episode for another series which got cancelled. This show is coming.
HBO  we need  GOT season 9 where Jon Snow A.K.A Aegon Targeryn will be the king of 6 kingdoms
Now we need a new Breaking Bad series!
Aaaaaaaaand it got canceled.
Bueno gente al menos no todo esta perdido tenemos futuras adaptaciones y aun queda dos libros por publicarse 🙌
Are they going to remake the 8th season of GOT as well? If not - what's the point of all this?
Seeing that new, closer to the books throne made my heart skip a beat
Mad king
I'm here only for dragons
Deneriyas grand grand grand grad mother and father house or Targaryen
I prefer 2022 illustrated as dragon egg dragon dragon    Crige huh
Why does it matter what happened 200 years ago ? i seriously don't get it Btw GOT is done, nobody talks about the show like it never existed.
I don't want to watch something that happens 200 years before GOT.. I want to watch something that happens after season 8~!
The throne room looks cooler, kinda. I get that they're keeping continuity(mostly) with the original show. But this, I feel, was their chance to make a more accurate version of the throne room. Their answer: lets just put swords everywhere  smh  That aside. I can't wait to see this. Been looking forward to it since I first heard about it
I can’t wait
They cancelled this cinematic abortion , they wrecked the ending of GOT so badly that it pretty much destroyed all after projects.
It's not available in india 😒
Is this serious actually happening!! I herd it was canceled
The last season of GoT made most of the fan strip naked and walk on the streets with a personal beller ringing and calling out "shame" for eternity.
YOOO I  RATE THE I MOVIE TRAILER
Hloo need tamil dubbed series
You can tell that he hated season 8. Both HBO and GRRM originally wanted the show to stretch out to 13 seasons (which it should have), and HBO was even willing to shell out the cash for it. But Dumb and Dumber over here wanted to move on to other stuff so they squished all that material into 6 episodes and singlehandedly destroyed the show. Yes, I say singlehandedly because everything else about the season was great, whether it was the acting, the cinematography, VFX, music, direction, everything was on point except the writing.  We are here in any case. But this is the last time.
I was so excited for this can't believe they cancelled it
After the GoT ending I think I'll pass this trailer looks rubbish >:(
WHY DID YOU CANCEL IT??? This is a lower blow than covid.
Why are the Valerions black doe?
0:39 and no..
Please tell me D&D have nothing to do with this!
A lot of people in here crying about the season finale
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Please don't cancel this series 😭
Yeah that's the way get a doctor who actor to make ya show truly great
*Never in the history of youtube have so many ill-advised clowns been delighted to falsely announce the demise of a show that hasn't even begun!*
👏♥️
It was cancelled 🤣
just watched GOT again so that i understand this trailer better 😭😂
Too bad it’s cancelled from what I hear
I'm so excited for this! This is all I been waiting for. I had a rough two years, and this show is what's giving me hope.
Canceled :((((
For who misunderstood about HBO canceled the show, it was not this show! It was about Bloodmoon aka GOT: The Long Night. They spent 30 million on the pilot and felt not right and canceled the show in favor of the new different GOT series, House of the Dragon.
Why cancel?
Oh I feel bad for you guys! HBO pulled a GRR Martin on this show lol
Well they made us mad again by cancelling this
So we will never see this series come out .....sad
Ramin ruled Thrones with his  exceptional music . This sounds a bit like his music. Is it him?
This entire franchise just needs to stay dead.
Lmao they canceled it
I’m hoping this is a good show, after the mess that was season 8
it will make no sens for me  if the move is like The Hobbit,before the accualy tv series......make a continue of the series not n before ......
let's hope the battles are I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.T.
I’m So excited 😆
What is this about them pulling the plug??????
Yeah sure absolutely wanna see this but kinda also have “can’t you guys use this budget to remake GOT season8 instead????” feeling  #Iwillneverstopbeingpettyabtthis
this aged well.
Canceled
Oof.. cancelled. That's rough buddy.     EDIT: Turns out to be a different spinoff. I'm illiterate. That's rough buddy.
Bruh this is like watching the last episode, so dark xd
Wait were there black targaryans?
Looks like it will be full of 2021 politics 🤡.
Can some lord of light or whatever lord they had bring Danny back for a 9th season😭😭😭
And it’s canceled!😂
Not interrested anymore after GoT 8th season fackup.
I heard this show is cancelled lmao.
cannot describe how excited I am to see Orys Baratheon and Aegon being buds.
I can't wait to see the show
oBTW .. rewatching GOT S1 masterpiece, which makes all the more painful the crap U heaped on us, SHAME SHAME SHAME
Hey HBO ... No one gives a flying (on dragons)  F... after you broke faith with fans, abrogated integrity in story telling, and killed this franchise ... kiss goodbye to billions/trillions & legacy
Bro why they have to canxel
LMAO RIP. This series was cancelled. SMH HBO.. SMH.
Canceled. Now cancel biden and woke leftist puke all over America and start again.
And then...Cancelled.
I jus heard u guys cancelled it
If you all think this is going to be good, you're fooling yourselves. There are no books to base this on it's just going to be some pathetic Hollywood writer's fanfiction.
To bad it got canceled!
хахаах седые негры косят под Таргариенов просто до слез!!!
i have no interest in watching this
Nah, incest did. Incest crippled him.
I'm hyped 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Too bad is getting canceled
Cancelled
How come they black washed ? The Valyrian race look like white people
First to say it--Time And Relative Dragon In Space.
so it's cancelled  eh??
I know it would not be "period accurate" to put a washing machine where a girl could get stuck in as sweet home alabama plays but it wouldn't be as bad as the GOT finale.
I am going to watch it, but only because Matt Smith is in it.
F...!! I CAN'T WAIT!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😎😎
no thanks👎
How many season does this series have to
Será raro ver otros personajes pero amo que no haya cambiado el ambiente
If Alabama was a fantasy land
i come from the future  i know what ending is.
I just saw the whole series in a month and wow yeah season 8 all my excitement went out the window I was left with many questions I’m super excited to follow this through now that I can afford HBO 😂🥴🥴😂😂
Regardless, Matt Smith is the reason I shall be watching. It's been long since I saw the Doctor
Despite season 8 and in hindsight after watching season 8, also season 7. I'm still excited for this show and I hope it's at least good
Can someone explain me plzz are we gonna see AEGON the Conqueror in this series or AEGON the 2nd of his name I didn’t quite get that
Cant wait. I hope this comes out the begging of the year.
If D&D are in charge of the writting im not interested #remember8
An hbo original series? This is from george r.r. martin books
We’re really bout to get Wheel of Time House of Dragon  Lord of the Rings show  All in a relatively close time😩
Tbh I just want like a “what if” series on game of thrones from HBO and them lot, similar to what marvel did with their “what if” series
I am really disappointed with GOT final season it was horrible ending hoping this could not be repeated
Tommen:Dreams Didn't Make Me King....Insest did.(Junps out Window)
Daenerys wakes up in season 6 and realized season 7 & 8 never happened
0:41 anyone else notice what dagger she have??????????????????????????????????????????
Will there be a continuation of Game of thrones
Any idea when it will be aired??
At this point, and after the gigantic disappointment, i trully ask thee.... Why-even-bother?
I really hope this TV show doesn't end up as Game of Thrones did. You guys ruined it!
AEMOND VS DAEMON HYPE!!!!
HYPE HYPE HYPE
I hope you give a nice history to the king of the night
BURN THEM ALLLLLLLLLLL
Опять BLM лезет отовсюду.
When is going to start ?
Let George RR Martin finish his books and maybe they will even right the original sin. :)  He wasn;t happy with the TV ending either.
They should put a lot of time into this and rush the last season
If they say "this show has 8 seasons" quickest way to induce fear
The narrator sounds like Richard Madden (Rob Stark)
Question. How can I watch this on release in Canada. Hard to believe HBO will sacrifice the Canadian market viewership on release. Had digital cable for original GOT but only using firestick with streaming apps now. Any suggestions
I wonder what D&D are doing now? And I wonder if they know on a daily basis they are hated for ruining one of the best shows ever created in the history of television. I can't unsee Season 8.
Targaryen then: "Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did." Targaryen now: "I dun wan it."
Anyways
Why is Ramsey Bolton narrating this?
Here for the culture
I hope that this one has the aegons conquest
Can't wait to see Balerion!!
Who makes you king Arya : No one 😂
Phew I hate smoking!
I hope they toned down on the incest scenes lol not trynna see all that
OMG!! Got so excited with this trailer that it actually gave me hiccups. Can't wait!!😍😍😍
We better get a "field of fire".
Please let it be the story of Aegon the conqueror.Show all its conquests ,his dragon balerion and his sisters who rode with him.
Every time a new GOT series comes out on HBO, the gods flip a coin and the world holds its breath..
“Dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did.” Boy shut up the Targaryens are in Westeros because one Valyrian chick had one dream one time
Targaryen black now? WTF
Namas le cambian el final porfa
I hope this new crop of HOD actors do not try to imitate the ones from GOT.
Just finished with season 8. Can anyone tell me why are you all so upset about season 8 and ending? Could be better of course, but still is pretty good.
Who is going to compose melody for this series ?
Fan made
This is going to be epic .. can't wait from India 🇮🇳
200 years before the worst ending in HBO
Ta potente!
I wonder if Lady Melisendre will appear in the show. She is 400 years i GoT. So she will be 200 years old.
Maaan, the finale (and to a lesser extend seasons 5-7) killed all the interest I had in anything GoT related. The Dance is really interesting but boy do I not care about this world and its mythology anymore.
What's the point.  It's a prequel to garbage.
Ok cool. Now re-shoot season 5 - 8 of Game of Thrones and we'll be all set.
with so many mixed people in the show im trying to understand how Daenerys looks the way she did. really confusing. seems like more diversity pandering to be honest. Some of the people just look like aliens. and yeah the show kind of ended bad.
Is they gonna stretch this till death of mad king and rule of Baratheon’s…..they should
I can't wait
Yeeaah, no.
Is there gonna be a hot black chick with blonde hair or that to much fantasy
Can't wait....this book was sooooo good.
Jon Snow: Now it's time to watch my father how good he is?
“Dreams didn’t makes us kings, nukes did.”
Woohoo
Is that Ramsey narrating it? The actor I mean...
It does not bother me that Daenerys died but She died like a villan, she deserved better.
I read the books and they were amazing . I’m assuming the people with the white dreadlocks are valerians because they were  very important in books. I could be wrong because I don’t know who they are but The valerians were said to be very pale so at least the dreadlocks are right .
Ok but can we talk about how SICK the throne looks 😍😍😍
When in 2022?
correct me if I'm wrong but I never heard of a black Targaryen
house of the doctor
O universo Game of Thrones vive 🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
❤️‍🔥
Yay for mediocrity
I was going to look if D&D were involved in the show and google gave the suggestion.....looks like i am not the only one wondering ....
Real or naw cause slame if it ain’t
I hope this flops for a few reasons.
Who here got goosebumps while watching this? Wow
I Can't WAIT for it
Repent for your sins thank and pray to God
0:39 I know they're trying to seem more inclusive, but how exactly does a famously inbred family become multiracial?
And he's still not ginger...
Please make this time in hindi language all seasons
I didn’t like Alicent in the books, but she looks AWESOME in this show. I can’t wait
Bring Daenerys back, and let her tell the story of her ancestors
I'm looking forward to it. Hope this also will be as interesting as GOT
They should start with: "Not from the creators of last season of Game of Thrones".
Rề ni > hightower
Civil war betwen Targaryen houses doesnt sound too good. It would have been better to see how Targaryen conquered the known world , the first time they had dragons
I love GOT. I would have ratherhad a spin off of how aegon nd his sisters toke over westoros. M gona watch house of the dragon nd probably love it, yet its GOT all over again, throne politics nd violence.
Will they be skipping the Blackfyre Rebellion? Boring!  Who wants to watch one entitled incompetent idiot fight another selfish entitled incompetent idiot for the Iron Throne?  Both Rhaenyra and Aegon were morons full of silly notions of what they're entitled to but no duty or responsibility to the ordinary people.  At least the Blackfyre Rebellion had interesting and capable figures like Baelor Breakspear Maekar Daemon Bittersteel and of course Bloodraven!
I'm still mad they ruined one of my favorite fictional characters of all time to a drooling "I dun't wantit"
The Wheel Weaves as the Wheel Wills.
Glad to see Prince Philip reincarnated into a proper King rather than jist a consort.
End of JON Snow's character was not impressive. Our expectations was more. So I don't like this series and I am not going to see i mean waste my time for another series. 🙄🙄😕👎👎👎👎👎👎
That voice is Daemon’s (Matt Smith)
I don’t even care for GoT (especially after what D&D did to it) but Matt Smith?! If he dies like 2 episodes in I’ll be upset but not surprised
I’m curious to see who’s going to play Mushroom.
please make got season 10 😯😯😯😯
There better be some starks in this
Start with the ending so I know if it's worth watching  ...
Where is dragon??😁😁
#obsessed
At 0:39 did anyone else get the Rastafarian Targaryen vibe? Coldplay's GOT the musical was taken seriously.
What will be the story of house of the dragon??  Aegon Targaryen's conquests, or Daemon Targaryen's story🤨🤨
I’ll always see Matt Smith as Doctor Who
Can't wait 😭
Game of thrones tamil dubbed please 🥺
Let's find something to do with those dragons and cost !!  same like done with ET dinosaurs and long character lists just let their queen act strange suddelyand got killed
0:42 House Stark
Dreams didn't make us kings, climbing walls did.
After the last debacle?
Hopefully this is good, but prequels cannot fix broken endings.
when it will be released someone is can tell me
throne war is better
Why would they skip aegons conquest?? That’s a season or 2 worth of stuff right there and woulda been epic. They skipped half the fire and blood novel smh
Tight tight tight!!! Sequel, prequel, spin off, whatever man, just keep bringing me that.
I cant wait for it 🤍
Oohh i didnt know the doctor was a Targaryen!
I'm excited to see Daemon Targaryen the rogue Prince he is character I'm most looking forward too.
FIRE WILL REIGN
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me, can’t get fooled again 😂😂
WTF is wrong with you people? If you don't like a show, don't watch it.
Mare Wave Thrill Spine Clocked Dream.
young laenor 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Have confidence, my friends.  If they stick to the book, they've successfully done their job.  If they don't, they make it blatantly clear that they only want their own validation
I need House of the dragon tamil vision
I love love got , I m a hardcore fan of got love from india
I can't wait for it!
I will be watching!
Waiting for 2nd game thrones please release it quickly also release the trailer.. 🇮🇳
Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did- daeyns the dreamer who had a dream that valyria was going to Hiroshima and made aenar leave their and go to dragonstone so they wouldn't die- am a Joke to you???
"They were dancing. In my dream. And everywhere the dragons danced the people died."
I CANNOT WAIT EEEEEK
❤️❤️❤️
Finish the books first, George.
Black Targaryian's???😳
BRING DANY BACK TO LIFE U MFS!
Afro-targaryen
The Doctor
Don't care if it ends up being good. Not gonna watch it
Love from India ❤️ please release in Hindi 🙏
Meh...
Whats the source material based on ?
I really hope they keep to using not as well known actors/actresses, would ruin the immersion if I saw … let’s say.. ed sheeran again.
Ojalá el final sea mejor que su antecesor, una gran serie con final poco bien explicado.  Espero que esta serie cuente con mejor desarrollo al final
Can't wait to see these
Someone should redo ASOIAF, but digitally animate it this time, like in Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV. Sean Bean was in it too. This time though, things like Targaryan eyebrows would match their hair, unlike GOT Danaerys's thick black ones, and the Iron Throne could look less like a halloween prop.
I'm glad that this show is produced by George RR Martin  and some others but not by David Benioff and DB Weiss, who made a joke out of GOT in the 8th season✌
Am I the only one who thought the finale to GOT was solid? Buncha hipsters
i thought the velaryons were white...
bout to see the big bad Conqueror Aegon, dog westeros, well most of westeros.
Daily watching this teaser
who cares
better come out soon, i can't wait...
If HBO is not going to respect the fans and trash their expectations or time. Why would fans spend any money supporting their trash production?
I hope they show melisandre the  red witch was mad old
Geronimo!!!!!
We remember season 8
Love matt Smith great actor looks good,hope it's not full on "WOKE"
A prequel to a train wreck? the audience remembers!
Where is Jon Snow....
Isn't that Ramsay's voice?
I really hope there's at least a couple cameos of some of the OG characters
Love all the comments about how upset people are over the end of the last one and how for one random reason or the other is "the only reason I'll watch this one" lol. You guys are a joke! You'll watch this regardless, quit lying to yourselves like you have a spine and won't watch this the moment it comes out based on some opinion you have over the end of the most watched show ever. Just stop. You know you're all gonna watch it.
Kind of excited for this but also sad they chose this prequel because I was sooo hoping for a prequel about Robert’s rebellion
Okay okay, okay okay I’m here for it, make sure y’all don’t end it on no BS
praying this has a better ending than game of thrones
They put a black man in so you know the entire plot and character is already ruined. He’s going to perfection through, strong, courageous, honest and he’ll get get the women. Just watch, it’s always the same.
This looks so empty and awful. At least the first half of the original series had quality books to pull from before the series nosedived.
HBO is no longer capable of making good tv
200 years before.... .. but they still dress the same 🙄😳
House "genocidal maniacs" .....
So i read everything about rhaenyra, laenor, & daemon & what happens in their futures. Seeing this now makes me even more excited.  Really had to pull out the targaryen family tree to understand it better lmfao.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💜
Wow, there's a black Targaryen? Lol.
I hope their lighting budget is better than S8's.
0:22 Lucius Malfoy looks badass with that Sword 0:29 Daenerys looks different 0:34 Woah! The Doctor is blonde now! But where is the TARDIS?
Hard for me to get hyped since we all know the outcome of season 8.
.
targaryens look so much better this time <3 :O
All i ask of HBO is this: Consider remaking GOT in around 10-15 years. Make that version more faithful to the books and with at lest   10 seasons
GOOSEBUMPS
The targaryens are awfully ugly though. Aren't they supposed to all be atleast somewhat beautiful in the books?
Nice! Please don't botch this one too.
Man cannot wait
The mad king is here
GoT was a gigantic clusterf*ck.  Why would this POS be different?
Think they'll try to explain how technology hasn't changed in 200 years? The nuance of a horizontal windmill vs a vertical one?
Please give us more than 8 seasons. That way we can be disappointed in the 9th
What do you guys think of the new design of the iron throne?
No D and D and George is part of it? Yeah I'll give it a shot
Do you guys still have a deal with Apple TV? I signed up for HBO thru Amazon and me and my dad were getting into GOT and boom, you guys cut the deal with Amazon and now we are trying to get HBO again where we can watch GOT thru the TV but it seems you also cancelled your deal with Apple.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I am hyped definitely. But I don’t want it to be dragged out for the next 10 years an only having 1 show i am obsessed with this world and its history an i want to see it all basically i want to be bran so have this story done in 3-5 seasons and then move on to another story like aegon the conqueror , maegor the cruel , duncan egg, bran the builder, roberts rebellion an many more.
WE DESERVED BETTER!!!!
00:40 the colors are perfectly beautiful
Joffrey - why don't you get near the fire dog ? The hound - because I don't want to be hot dog 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
200 ? The book is 300 years are they gonna skip aegons conquest and the old kings reign ?
Matt Smith the GOAT I'm already hooked.
If the ending of GOT hadn't been so bad, surely more people would be happy with this trailer
Solo quiero ver a sir Barristan
No way that was Daenerys at the end right? Drogon flew back in time??
Thank God the book for this one is completed.
Atleast its for sure now that Rhaenyra's son's with Laenor aren't his and are truly strong lol unless that change that too.
Rafiki: "The past hurts sometimes, but you can run from it, or... Learn from it" HBO: "We're gonna LEAN INTO it."
Just a quick question: are D & D still in charge?
I like how people only focus on the last season of Game of Thrones and not the 7 amazing seasons before it
How do you give a Targaryen a Circumcision?   Kick his sister in the jaw.
Mehmet Targaryen
Dragon is coming
I hope they make something for after that horrible ending of the original GOT.
Doctor who?
Did anyone notice that the sigil on the final is different from the Targaryen sigil? just like the last episode of GOT.. 4 legs instead of 2
Maybe it the bitterness that GOT left me but the first time I watched this trailer I was getting a feeling like it's fanmade. Like they're coplayers hahahaha Anyway I hope it's good as opposed to GOT.
I see Wesley Snipes being the main protagonist against the house of vampires.
Do y’all think Winds of Winter will be released around the same time? It would be the best surprise and really good marketing for the show
Hey, George R. R. Martin! You shouldn't finish the god damn books before starting another project, though?
Prince Philip is a Targaryen. 🐉🔥🩸
Esperando...!! 🤞🤟🙌
After watching "the white queen", "the white princess" and "the spanish princess" The whole of GoT just feels like an (awesome) ripoff of british history - the war of roses and the Tudors :D
"Every time a targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin and the world holds its breath"
Gucci needs new blood
All this leads to Bran the Broken 🤧😭🤧
Dear god please let this be as good as it looks
The Doctor sounds a little angry here. What's wrong with him?
WE wuz valyrians
Just keep tweedledum and tweedledee away from it and I'll give it a shot.
The ending would be; the entire movie is bran looking to the past
looking forward to it
I just want the Dunk and Egg show
This is going to be the best show ever.
Daemon and Rhaenyra the most badass couple in GoT.
"Dreams didn't make us kings, incest did." Aahhhh aaahhhhhh aahhh aahhhhhh🎵
Meh
480p?
@HBO Will you ever reconsdier doing the last season over again? Even if animated or something! Just give us a different ending, the one intented
I can't wait for finally seeing house Velaryon! And perhaps house Dayne?
Can I watch this without having watched Game of Thrones?
Melisandre was already 229 years old when the events of this show came to be, I will just let that sink in.
9
Hope there is someone in this series who can see future, so that we can see our favourite characters in GOT😌
Dreams didn't make us Kings...    Bran: Am I a joke to you 😌
oh everythings gonna be fine, the doctor is here to save us 0:33
Are the dumb and dumber directing this?
Please have more after this prequel😫😫😫😫
I hope this is nothing like the last two seasons of GOT. The way that show ended compared to how it began was forgettable to say the least and has me not excited about this.
The ending of S8 makes all of this literally pointless. You know Daenerys is just Hitler 2.0 and is going to kill millions of people. You know a wheelchair Bran is the King. And you John Snow basically becomes a wildling instead of King of the North and basically becomes a hermit. Literally nobody cares what happened 200 years before when we know the ending is beyond trash. Stop pretending like it didn't happen and own up.
I hope to see vileria this time
how can I ever be excited for this knowing how Game of thrones ended?? remake season 8 then we can move forward.
Balerion Vhagar Meraxes vermithor Sunfire and many more are coming.....🔥
I will say I was surprised when I found out Corlys was going to be played by a black actor. But I’m sure he is going to a great job. The whole cast will surely do a great job.
It sounds a bit like Rob Stark who is talking definitely sounds Familia
SPOILER:                                                                                                           All of this leads up to Bran on the throne! LMBAO!
Wooow nice but I want to see a flashback about aegon the conqueror and his dragon balerion the black dread scene
Yall need to stop ranting. You know the ending was not that bad. And also, stop saying you're not excited for this or not going to watch because we all know you are. Shut up.
Can’t wait😩
As if GRRM didnt do a good enough job at finishing garbage with even more garbage, now we're throwing garbage.
No, we are not getting back together. Not like this.
Let’s be calm, everyone deserves a second chance. But if you mess this up as well HBO, you’re done for.
Apology not accepted
I'm ready for another civil war.
HBO plzzz Release Hindi Dubbed Of game of thrones and house of dragon
Love from India please Hindi dubbed game of thrones please ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WTF ?🤦‍♂️
Still suffering PTSD from GOT last season
Но мы уже знаем финал...
I want a spin off the origin of khal drogo 😭
Please end with aegon starting a revolt to take his throne back from his cousin
Jon deserved better
Anyone else see similarities with the dragon logo at the end and Mortal Kombat?
Happy Halloween 🎃👻🎃
My teacher:Tell me some of the biggest man made disasters. Me: Chernobyl disaster,Bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and GOT season 8😂😂
Despite all the hate, I'm still really excited about this. Not only is the source material there and interesting in its own right, the lineup seems great and there's a lot they can work with. Can't wait honestly!
Without D&D I’m gonna give this show the benefit of the doubt lol
Black Targaryens?? Really?
YA NO PUEDO ESPERAR MAS !!!!!! house of dragon !!! YES YES YES YES
No eran 300 años antes? Igual estoy super emocionada por este spin off💕
Just keep Dumb & Dumber away and I will watch it
Why 200 years ago, why not 300 years ago? From very start of Tragaryan rule? How they ended up on the throne?
After what u did with the last show … I don’t think so
No Comment...
10 years again
Iam so pissed off right now instead of them make a sequel for GoT, there take us to the past before any of my favorite charters where even born
Please make new 8th season of GOT while actors still young please
gods... kings... fire... and blood.   hyped
Anything that shoehorns diversity in this hard is destined to be cringe AF
"Dreams didn't make us kings" Daenys the Dreamer: ....
Wow you should really sue the directors of the 2 last seasons. They moved the franchise from a must see to meh I don't care about this at all.
very excited to watch this masterpice  From  the country of Mt Everest and lord budha nepal🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
Can't wait ❤️❤️
Pk il n’est pas sur netflix ?
i watched all of game of thrones and im not going to watch any of this out of protest
Just killed it 💥💥💥👌
I can't wait!!! So exciting
They should've took the budget for this to properly produce another last two seasons of GOT....
Isso sim q é trailer de se arrepiar 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
hi
I am gad that they admitted that season finale was the fall of throne (0:15)
The climax of season 8 :- Tyrion:- Heyy bran... I will name you as a king in that meeting and you will make me the hand   Bran:- Deal done Mf  😂🤣
Ramin Djavadi ♥️🤩🥰
👍
19 dragones 🔥🔥🔥
I love how everyone isn't talking about the fact that Matt "11th Doctor" Smith is in this.
This better be good  This is the only way we could forgive you for what you did in season 8 of got
Thanks but no thanks. I'm done with Game of Nonsense, give me more series like Chernobyl instead.
Don't kill any dragons ☹️☹️ i love dragons 🥺🥺😓😓
Ill wait until all seasons are done for this one. Not going to be disappointed again after watching
Espero que esté mejor que la última temporada.
I'm still going to watch the show but I'm not excited for it and even if it's good it's going to be hard to watch. Here's why   We all know GOT ended horribly but most importantly the Targaryens had one of the worst if not the worst possible ending yet this show is about them so we are watching a show about a family who's influences lead to a  horrible ending and so it's hard to be happy for any accomplishments they make. The Targaryen legacy is either gone or ruined because of the recent descendants. One of them was crazy and attempted to burn his citizens, the next one was a horrible person who was killed accomplishing nothing,  the one after that went crazy(out of nowhere) and burned her citizens, and the final one was banished to the night watch and ended up where he started and didn't move on.  So how can we watch a show about a family who has that legacy?
I’m so glad hbo went woke on this so I don’t have to waste 8 years watching it
Why is everyone so mad about how GOT ended? It’s an ending what did you guys want ? Lol . 10-10 ending
JESUS saves!!!!!!!
CHRIST is the ONLY WAY to heaven 💔❤️😇🙏.
Dub it in hindi
If Jon Snow became the king in the end that would be the only worthy ending for watching a prequel. Imagine watching this show and knowing 200 years later a lost Targaryen will rule all kingdoms with justice 🔥 now there's no point really
Imagen all the greatness we will see in this series. And then think waw to bad it endet that way. No matter the beggining their is no ending .
A black Targaryen? WTF? Why you want to ruin everything as written and meant to be?  Not everything nor every character gotta be black.
200 years before the great disappointment:
Matt Smith and Milly Alcock; sounds good as long as the previous showrunners dont get anywhere near.
Instead of doing the end of GOT right they are now going to f up a whole new series.
daemon targaryen with a tardis? damn
hello, do you want an hbo max account?
Im hyped
Gods, Kings, Fire and Black Targaryen
You need to get your marketing up!
Omg it’s coming on January 1st 2022.  Who is more excited than me?
Después del final de GOT creen que veré este disparate??
This franchise is dead
I so hope they get this right and continue in the vein and feel of the first 6 seasons of GoT
I would of been happy to never think about game of thrones again
Hbo with another lgbtqzyand sometimes x show “we’re here”. Awesome another trans show. Cool!
this year will be something to watch. wheel of time. lord of the rings serious and house of the dragon. talk about competition
At the very least I I really wanted John snow to have a child with wildling and it be born blonde and look like his father. And for one of the dragons to leave eggs wrapped in khalessis dress. Just 1 minute of these two scenes would of made all the difference.
I was reading about this when they still called it project: red gun and I swear, that's a sensationalist title if I ever heard one. And yet... Living up to the hype. 100%.
Let's hope the ending is better than GoT...
*In my Tyra Banks voice: "WE WERE ROOTING FOR YOU!" 😐😑😒
IM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HYYYYYYYPPPPPPPEEEE OMG ! NOSTALGIA STRUCK ME FROM THE BEST SERIES EVER RELEASED !
No. What’s with all this diversity, this mean they were killed of extinct and it’s a whole mother story but I know that’s not the case
🤢
hmu if u want a good time
0:23 I now that the said 200 Year before Game of  thornes and that probably its  the dance of dragons, but a believe that fat king is Aegon the unworthy with the valerian sword black fire.
9.99/per month = No thanks
❤️❤️❤️
So this is how Prince Philip took the Crown.
Matt Smith 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
FINALLY! Best news I've heard tv wise in a very long time. Now let's finally get peaky blinders and get warrior renewed I'm happy as can be.
Wow I am so excited
IF I COULD GIVE MORE DISLIKE I WOULD
Do I really want to invest hours into a show where they can't be bothered to finish it with any love and refuse to acknowledge the awful end result and then expect everyone to be over the moon about this? Not really.  All a it meh.
Dreams doesn't make us King Dragons did  that's Rob Stark voice right?
Can we have in Hindi version
I am more like to see essos than westeros, especially the most east side
Black guy as a Targaryen? 😂🤦
Yesss!! 🤩
Guys listen... it could be good
Acho que essa Série Game of Thrones - Casa do Dragão vai mostrar A Queda da Casa aTargaryen é a Quase extinção dos Dragões. Já que essa Série se passa 200 anos antes de Game of Thrones! 👀👀........
We shall have our redemption.
I mean it's a prequel like we know who wins lol
Some of y’all need to get over it 😂 show was awesome
As long as they stick with the source material.     Like literally, you could drag the reign of one of the kings for literally a whole season or two.
All reservations aside, I like the added detail of the extra swords around the Iron Throne, brings it closer to the books
Is thisfake?
Just the doctor on another shenanigan
Who's ready for incest and dragons
I’m already seeing the first episode starting with flashbacks of Aegon the conqueror and his sisters with the music of house targaryen in the background 😎
Joffrey: "Dreams didn't make me king, my mom did"
“Gods, kings, and…..a blue police box
S8 gave me such a foul taste in my mouth that I'm finding it really hard to feel anything for this spin off.
Free bus travel for women in delhi, how is that not sexism ?
If the islanders have Targaryen blood in them, why aren't they mixed race? It's besides the point, though. There's no justification for them being another race. Colour-blind casting ruins immersion and it's getting ridiculous.
14.000 people are who was executed by Targaryens.
Im good thanks
SO EXCITED
Why not just finsih the original series before going on to make spin offs.... R.R martin is a sham. He doesnt care about the books or the fans he just want that Fat HBO check.
मेरी आँखों में झाँकने से पहले जरा सोच लीजिये ऐ हुजूर...  जो हमने पलके झुका ली तो कयामत होगी...।  और हमने नजरें मिला ली तो मुहब्बत होगी...।
Me trying to figure out where all the dragon skulls that are supposed to line the throne-room are 🧐🧐 Also pretty bummed there won’t be any dragons 😞
Can the next series be about the white walkers first attack? In my opinion the white walkers were the most interesting enemy in the show
Someone make Martin finish the books please. There is another Dragon  (Targaryen) at the end of book 5.       Otherwise I will do fandom the rest like Twilight
Dreams did not make king dragons did♥️♥️♥️
I am never watching game of thrones spin offs until they remake season 8
Remember when you guys ruined the show the entire world was in love with
Hope they stay loyal to books this time.
This is not Game of Thrones, grow up you stupid fan boys,  this is HOUSE OF THE DRAGON.
House Velayrion are black......what
Are D&D making this?  If so, RIP before it even had a chance.
Another red wedding approaches maybe 🤔 nah maybe the show wont take it far. Now that i say that its probably true.
i going to have a very hard time watching this with what happened to daenerys
valar dohaeris
Give it up.
Lots of salty and funny comments about season 8, which ofc are all fair. Season 8 was terrible. I would just like people to keep in mind, that Martin's world of a Song of Ice and Fire is home to multiple amazing stories, just like Tolkien's LOTR. This is one of them and full of potential to dazzle us through our tv screens.
black targarien. maybe the parents didnt tell him not to play with the drogons
AHHHHHYYYYYGGGGGYHEDUEHIDJEODNE
where is the dragon we want the damn dragon
MATT SMITH YESSSSSSS THIS IS PERFECT
"Dreams didn't make us kings,dragons did". Uhm no. Hodor made kings because you know he HO l DOR.
Boy I can't w8 to see Rhaenyra getting chomped by Sunfyre!
I reeaaaallly hope this is as good as the first 4 seasons of GoT
Thought i was done after the finale but sign me up!!!
VERY EXCITEDD 😱😱😱
Watch it end about the same, not knowing how.
Is it just me or Ramsay Bolton was doing the monologue???
Nothing really matters to me since Dany and her dragons die out anyway :( ....i would kill for this show if Dany would not die in s8...now its just lame
Remake GOT
Hope the don’t F this one up
What's the point? At the end we will be disappointed
Boiiii
I'm still hoping HBO will someday reboot the Game of Thrones series to include the true ending of Song of Ice and Fire, kind of like how Fullmetal Alchemist was rebooted as 	":Brotherhood, a version without a sloppy ending. That is, if Martin ever actually finishes the books (unlikely).
Everything is OK here so much more now and now recovering well now recovering
How about they publish the last book it's been two f-king years.
I expect to see Jaggen Hagar as a faceless baby.
200 years prior? So Walder Frey should be about 18 years old then.
I’m ready! I’M READY!!  As soon as we get the Rothschilds and their minions up off of humanity and their poison shots.
🤍🤍🤍
Only Stark
Gods Kings Fire  and Blood Dreams didnt make us Kings, Dragons did.
Aegon:where’s my sister-wives!
I think „Valyria“ would be way more Awesome.  Or „The First Stark-Bran“  Or The Long Night  Or Azor Ahai  Or What if Stannis never got screwed by the script
The End of trailer is every thing
Aye I didn’t know Matt Smith was going to be lead!!
I mean, I might watch it, but I'm gonna complain the whole time
I like this!
The winter is coming ❄️🐉🐺
If this becomes a masterpiece, don't let it get to an 8th season, Please.
Not brought to you by David Benioff & D. B. Weiss - would be a great selling point
Waiting
Oh yes I'm gonna see -. ..- -.. . ... again for sure. And .. -. -.-. . ... -
looks like the eleventh doctor had some fun when travelling to medieval times 😂
حماس
Top
my eyes
I am literally in shock just 12m commong guys and this deserves more
I’m super excited to watch this. I’m a huge GOT fan.
Did I just see a netflix adaptation?
Hai can you pls release your series in hindi  Most of your viewer are waiting for hindi dubbed got in India from season 3  Love from india
everyone is moaning about the end, and I don’t disagree with you all, but you all is lying if you saying you won’t watch it
dragons are still rendering? GIVE US DRogonsssss
i am so excited for this show!!!!!!
Espero que no la caguen
This movie some scene like my homeland
LESSSS GO!!!
I see no one bothered that valerian described in books as blond with ashen hair and faeal eyes black
0:39 nice ))
I just love it. I can't wait any more
"Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did" this line has literally become a part of me
Aaegon targaryen conquered the westeros but its demon targaryen in the show.. Can someone explain plz???
Why did the Valerion family and Daemon's concubine set black and Asian?  Originally, the Valerion family was a Valyrian immigrant before the Targaryen  exile and mixed with Targarene's bloodline, so did it have to be changed even though it was practically a dragon lord with white skin, silver hair, and purple eyes.   If staff want to include black people or ethnic minorities, you can put them as dragon's seed or mercenaries.
Can't wait 😁😁
OMG
Imagine movie will come : House of the Freys 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Am super excited can't wait
Friendly reminder to seed after you DL :)
They are trying to rise the fandom of got.But the last season ruined it completely.
LOVE LIKE SHARE COMMENT ENGAGEMENT VIEWS
All these years I've been silent and I know some of you moved on from this but I don't know anyone watches GoT where I'm from so let me express my agony here before fangirling again for this new series.  How the freakn heck did Bran became the king!? Based on how the series was doing I knew Jon wouldn't be king. But Bran? It's like telling me Merlin became king rather than Arthur. 😢 😥😥😥😢  When Tyrion was starting to point out that He wanted Bran to be king. My reaction was 'Naww... He wouldn't accept it. People would vote for Tyrion to be king' but when he accepted I'm like '😐....SoN oF a !'  😥 Thanks guys I'm catched up.  I'm 30 percent okay now! 😅
I just have to say ,the black guys with white hair looks amazingggg!
"Even 7 prequels won't be able to fill the hole that last season left behind"
This made me cry
Why is Corlys black
If there are depictions of sexual assault, human trafficking or exploitation through enslavement I will not be watching.
Wanna see how mad the mad king was
Please HBO do all series in hindi of game of thrones 🙏🙏🙏
Waiting 🔥🔥🔥
i hope you've learned your lesson, the way you butchered the last season has ruined any opportunity for any form of replayability,
Literalmente el 99% de las personas ignoran este mensaje: “Dios guarde a tu familia y a ti de toda enfermedad 🙏❤
"Si te tomas un segundo para leer este pequeño comentario, Jesús te ama y que te proteja de esta enfermedad".¡Amén!🙏❤♥️
I hope this will make up for the finale..
If they can’t even write a good script for a Sopranos movie, what makes you think they’ll write anything good for GOT?
holyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Yaaaas
When is this coming out?
Please make the ending grand and meaning full and please take time to rewrite it if needed but don't spoil a brilliant story.
VALAR MORGHULIS
Game of thrones: House of Alabama
Never watched GoT but think it’s about time I should
💗
So you want us to see this for 8 years and be disappointed at the end
We will never forget what you did to us
Give us aegons conquest in return to season 8
eh
It’s like I wanna be excited but I’m not because of that finale
DIOS ME VUELVO LOCO
I hope they stick to type and bump off Matt Smith within the first few episodes, if not . . I won't be watching much beyond that.
What date should I put in my agenda?
my one-track doctor who tumblr brain from 2012: hey, it's matt smith in a wig
epic
Dreams didn't make them kings? Daenys the Dreamer might have something to say about that.  The show looks so good I can even forgive the extra legs on the sigil lol
Who is the narrator
If not his sister's dream, Eagon will die with Valeria... So, probably dreams make him king as well:p
They better make a character that close the door this time. They can name him Clodor.
Please relez in hindi audio 😢
It gives me a woody just knowing it's only a few months away!
Can’t wait to watching
Don't let this distract you from the fact that they completely messed up  season 8.
Games of incest coming to home near you.
The witcher
O my god.
Nah man you guys screwed us over the last time. How do we know this is different? You broke our hearts man.
I'm READY!!! Let's Go!!!! House Targaryen!!!!!!!
YASSSSS
My Love is back
Espero que não me decepcionem
Aeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, agora simmmmm caracaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
rewatched the series and the finaple wasn't as bad as the first time I kinda sorta see why they did wa they did.....kinda
omg
HBO MAX keeps on giving!!! Love it! Best subscription ever!!!!
Anyone that would like to see Blackfyre rebelions after this spin off? I think that would be great story. All those bastards, Daemon, Aegor, Bloodraven and misteries that comes with them and events that were happening in those times. Martin created big world, where there could be independent series for a lot of different periods of history. I hope we going to see a lot of them.
I'm sure it will be successful and chic, but without Emilia Clarke it's not right
The doctor! XD
*Fear & skepticism abound but "The Witcher"? Really?! It takes more than guys with blonde wigs to turn GoT into Xena Warrior Princess, er, The Witcher, FFS!*
Will Zack Snyder's Justice League: Justice Is Gray be released on video?
Guys, it's okay. George R. R. Martin actually *finished* this story (I know, sounds crazy) so the producers can use his ending instead of creating their own godawful fanfiction.
Nice
I have no idea why people hate season 8 so much. Game of Thrones was never about fulfilling destiny - neither Dany nor Jon were ever going to win the throne. This new show is going to be incredible.
i just realized i couldnt care less
is that a black Targaryen?
Got vs lotr.. 2022 would be lit🔥  And world cup as well... 🤣
Sorry, I'll be watching the second season of the Witcher instead. Maybe I'll catch this on Blu-ray.
Really milking the living light out of this narrative. 😂
Please put Arabic subtitle in your app for movies and tv shows
This is it HBO. This is your chance to redeem yourselves. Good choice on bringing in Matt Smith.
that token black guy with silver hair... my god.. this show is probably gonna be the ultimate sjw sh.tshow ever. hard pass.
Who is the black guy? There are black people in Westeros?  Edit: on second thought one of the Targaryen bastards was described with pretty dark skin. Nettles her name methinks. So maybe black people have been hanging around afterall.
I'm gonna be cautiously optimistic. After all I feel like everyone working on this show knows their lives all depend on how it turns out.
HBO: Choose your plan. Me: yes, torrent
Completely pointless
Is this written by GRR or the  2 directors who ruined the end of GOT
I saw a picture of two platinum blond haired people, saw the chin and thought “hold on a tic, that’s matt smith” and scoured the internet for information, leading me here
Young Rhaenyra almost has resemblance with Daenerys Targaryen . I hope it is great
I just realized that most of the characters and dragons in the show are going to end up DEAD. So I'm not going to get attached to ANY of them.
I don't think this will be a hit series.cause GOT became hit series because of Emilia Clarke do if she is not here then low chance.
Best series of the decade✨
0:38 euh ok??
En attente 🔥🔥
omg
Game of Thrones died a horrible and nasty death, kinda like most of the characters but the shows death wasn't enjoyable to the viewers !
🤩
I hope it is like the last one realistic
Nice teaser, but why does the dragon have 4 legs? In the books, dragons have 2 legs, while in GoT they have 2 legs. And the Velaryons .... Why are they black? I hope the show explain this, because even in the animation from HBO, Velaryons were typical white Valyrians. In fact, it smacks of hypocrisy on the part of the creators of the series and the HBO bosses
Waiting 🔥❤
People in this comment section are literally reacting like their toxic ex used the 'I have really changed' card and I love it!!🤣🤣🤣
Kinda sounds like Ramsey Bolton!
I hope this time the dragons are transgender and purple haired.
Not gonna watch it just so they can F it up in the end.
Cant you just make a feature film on roberts rebellion?
NEEEEEED BLACK PEEEEEPOOOOO. MORE DIVERSITY RAHGHHHH
Arriba los Verdes 💚🐲✊
there is no tv show like you made a GoT and we hoping for this one too
And now we all have to act like we don't want to see Jon Snow and Tormund drinking ale at castle black 😂💔
waiting
Can't wait
A man needs a name
No HBO, not making the same mistake twice.
Im very excited on how the writers will ruin this   show for everyone...😊😊
Dreams didn't make them King, Dragons Did. 🐉
The only way they would have ended the show was through writing a better storyline, at least let the golden company shine before burning them, like I understand the iron fleet getting burnt to even the playing field.   If I was the writer, I'd station the Dothraki forward to meet the Golden Company and see how the Golden Company fair against the greatest calvary, then sneak the Unsullied and men of the North into the city in a surprise attack to meet the Lannister forces. Tyrion would also sneak in with the Northmen and lace the sea with black fire, take some scorpions and fire at the Iron fleet with the Lannister army occupied at the gate, then when all is almost lost, when the Dothraki are retreating, let Dany come and burn them down, and burn the remaining iron fleet who have already suffered many casualties under the scorpions, with the North losing alot of men. Then as the Unsullied are almost defeated by the superior numbers of the Lannister army, the Dothraki(who were saved from the already torched Golden Company) come to their rescue. And a fight ensues between evenly matched Lannisters and a combined Unsullied and Dothraki army, meanwhile, the North move into the castle with the help of Tyrion where Jon Snow and the Hound fight the Mountain and win, they capture the castle and Cercei out of desparation blows up most of the city with wildfire not wanting it to be ruled by Cercei. Jaime Lannister who witnesses what Cercei has done, sneaks behind her and stabs her in the back crying. Meanwhile, the queen is proclaimed dead and the war ends. In the end, Jon is given the North to rule as King, Jaime is made the commander of the armies and Tyrion remains hand of the Queen and given Casterly Rock. The Dothraki, Unsullied and all armies are intergrated as one under a new banner with all the seven kingdoms. Meanwhile, emissaries are sent to the Bank to pay repatriation for hiring the Golden Company on behalf of Cercei and the money is used to rebuild the city. The other kingdoms are given the option to join the new queen or rule as democracies and many opt to join. After Dany is crowned queen, Drogon flies Dany to a place where she finds another dragon egg and Dany hides it and in her speech vows to use Dragons only when the dead return. Later she gets her baby and names him Eddard after Jon's father and the kingdom regains peace once more.
Seems a bit to soon..... HBO must be suffering withdrawals from GOT
GOT ending is worst movie ever, even if you was trying to turn it into fairy tales show, it's also not good at all.
Is Dumb and dumber gonna be involved in this?
Yes yes finally something awesome is coming😃😃😃
Hope it doesn't end like Season 8
i have finished got yet wtf happens in the season finale that everyone hates
I loved GoT's finale! :D
Release Hindi dubbed please
Directors should prove they have the ending all written up already and cast  approves it.
Finally my one of the best experience  series is come ❣️
Lets see... how did the original series do once the showrunners ran out of books to base it on...   oh yea... so badly that 2 blind monkeys at typewriters could have done better... soo... yea lets do some more of that!!
I seriously can’t wait to watch this.
This trailer should have more than 12 million views. Lmao
Matt Smith returns!
I’ve always wished that the war of dance with dragon be adapted and it’s finally true ❤️ there’s so much curiosity to know about nettles and her dragon sheep-stealer since the book barely talked about her , and who’s the true father of the Queens sons? I can’t wait to find out
This is the 200 time that I see it,  And I can't get enough
I've watched this teaser trailer countless times and I still get chills. So hyped 🙌🏾 🐲🔥
NO! Get it through your thick skull HBO, we loved you for the sopranos and other great shows, but there is no resurrecting  Game of Thrones. Nobody asked for it, nobody wants it, and nobody is going to get invested in another season of it and you know damn well why. Don't blame the fans, blame yourself. Move on!
Another CGI show with blasé characters and catchphrases.
Don’t count me in if D&D are working on this. I’m still mad at them.
This will be good. I can feel it.
Nope. No Arya goes to sea, no more Game of Thrones for me.
As the Gojames said "Fak u", we didnt forget abt GOT S8 mfs. Spreading salt over our wounds😢😢
Investing in crypto now is very cool especially with the current rise in the market now
The Targaryens would have been fine if it wasn’t for that animal Blundetto.
.
I can't believe after 11 years 😖
OMG I just CAN'T wait !!! Thanks for doing a prequel to GOT 🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
LETS GO BRANDON!!!!
que emoción!!!!! ya quiero ver más dragones y muertes a diestra y siniestra :3
Spoiler alert everybody dies.
simply nice !
46th sec  was that Ramsay 😂
is this a what if version of GoT?
I'm just pretending the entirety of Season 8 didn't happen and we're all waiting on GRRM for WoW, etc. Much happier this way....
2022🥱🥱😫😫
PLEASE ALSO RELEASE IN HINDI LANGUAGE HBO ❤
Is it the sequel of GOT
Anyone getting hyped for this, are the people who'd get back with their ex after they cheated on them.
Can somebody clarify me whether In this series we will see aegon's story or dance of the dragon.
so like game of thrones and more dragons?
Although in my opinion most of the time sequels/prequels ruins the titles, let's see what will happen 🤔
Despite the worst season ever, I’m still going to watch this
If the two D's from GOT are directing this then I swear to god -_-
TRASH
Your ma kwin
Please release in india in hindi language.
음?? 공개 안하는게 더 나았겠는데?? 참 성의없다. 2년전 참사를 잊은듯?? 아님 찍어놓은게 별로라 넘 기대하지 말라고 일부러 기대감을 낮추려는 건가?? 근데..그래도 나오면 또 볼 내 모습이 벌써부터 상상되네.😭 일단 그지같은 트레일러에 다들 화났고 나도 실망하고 감😤
Can't wait 🙃
No no no not Matt smith please
As long as Benioff and Weiss don’t get their filthy hands on it, I’ll give it a chance.
Novo Vício  Tchau Game of Trone ...🤣 Olá House of the dregon :😉 I love ❤️ HBOMax 🥰😍 Quem é Netflixo ?
Not watching this out of spite
yeah but... season 8 tho...
GOT, the most addictive series I've ever saw. It's like watching an artist paint a masterpiece... and at the end he just finishes it up with crayons.  Go ahead, y'all start  without me, let me know how it ends. Then I'll binge watch it. Maybe.
After the dumpster fire that was the last two seasons of GOT...
You know, it's funny.  I didn't even know this was coming out and it feel like the public has largely moved on from GoT.  Just goes to show you how a terrible finale can doom the entire legacy of your series.
Won't see it guys. We all know how the Targaryen bloodline ends, so what's the point? Don't make entire series just to benefit from a popular francise - which is not THAT popular anymore after the finale. Everything in the name of profit!
Eeek the dragons 😍😍😍😍😍
Not gonna lie, the cast is pretty ugly 😬
🔥🖤
A Bird sent me here
I believe they already have books for this series. Hopefully they just follow those. 🤞🏽
Spoilers ahead: . . . "They lived a long and peaceful life."   Wait, that is not how...   "They lived a long and peaceful life!"
Boom!
OH GOD YES
more like House of the BAD DRGON am i right fellas HAHAHA
Where exactly did the black people come from apart being forced die to diversity. George didn’t have any in his book of valerian decent. Explain
Bran will be narrating like the Watcher.
2020-21 :  fear of Corona🦠 2022 : Fear of Dragons🐲
Protect Basic Human Rights End Roman Catholic Slavery Baptism leads to Indoctrination  Give the People back their BASIC HUMAN RIGHT to choose their own religion.  Make Baptism Illegal NOW!  Preaching and teaching that innocent newborn babies are born with “original sin” is one of the oldest tricks in the book, and it is in direct contravention to the very first Article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: Article 1: “Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected.”  Preaching and teaching that newborn babies are born with “original sin” is an attack on human dignity. That is a FACT.  Every single human should have the BASIC HUMAN RIGHT to choose their own religion, and baptism of newborn babies into ANY organised religion should be made illegal IMMEDIATELY.  The European Court of Justice and the International Court of Justice of the United Nations have let everyone down on this so far. And that is just not good enough.  The leading Judicial Institutions of the World have a global responsibility to have the COURAGE to stand up to powerful institutions and forces in the world, and protect the BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS of the HUMAN MIND, and especially to protect the BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS of those who cannot protect themselves.  The human race will only have a chance to reach its full potential when the shackles of organised religions have fallen from the human mind.  Please like and share this post near and far, across the world, until there are global changes in this regard.  Thank you
2022 is amazing with AOT and GOT prequel
Well i wonder,if this wasnt created by Martin then wont be like the last 3 seasons of GOT?a total disappintment?
So you expect me to pay for HBO again after what you did to me last time?
I read the Targaryean history book Fire and Blood when it came out and fell in love with Rhaenyra so much that it's now my daughter's middle name
So Dragon is still in CGI processing :P
having this show center around the lineage of a character they decimated is such a slap in the face
This better be good!
Looks awful, will be awful. A ton of semi famous faces is a bad sign.
Matt Smith was born to play the side chick married to the powerful queen
I'll watch it as long as you guys promise me you'll never let the two writers (not RR Martin) of the Game of Thrones anywhere near this show.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
A serie about aegon’s conquest was far more epic
People still crying because of S08? C'mon, it's just one season. And this is from different writers and based on a book written by GRRM himself.
We won't Hindi dubbed
A lot of complaints now, but it’ll probably be the most torrented show ever again
Can not wait hope it's going to be as good as game of thrones
WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS? DAENERYS IS ALIVE AND ALL LANNISTERS MUST DIE
Why can't this be the whole history of House Targaryen starting with Aegon and his sisters and not just the Dance of Dragons.  We're missing prime material with Aegon's Conquest, Maegor vs Aenys, and Jaehaerys who actually united all 7 kingdoms.  The Dance of Dragons could've easily been the 4th and 5th season of a show called House of the Dragon! 😭😤
For all the people that have a bad taste in there mouths this isnt made by D&D give it a change it could be great
The fact that d and d are not here and george is here makes me hyped
മലയാളി ഉണ്ടോ
2019 was the fall of the world starting with GOT's final season, now that it's back I believe House of the Dragon will be amazing and will lead us back into those good times.
Don't know why but I just don't want to see it after that pathetic 8 season
although season 8 of GOT was rushed and characters didn't get their perfect ending its still probably top greatest shows of all time. us fans dont know what goes on behind the scenes, could have been alot of arguing over the ending.. Martin could have requested a botch just so his last book will sell more? who knows
0:51 wow the throne looks so much more accurate to the books.
The 11th Doctor!
If this gets woke'ed up by the far left again and ruin yet another show I will be completely done with tv
Didn't get one shiver. Not into it. Gonna pass. The last few season of GOT gave me all I needed from that world.
This isn't going to be as good as people think. They butchered all the original GoT filming crew because of DD's incompetence. Go do a little digging into HoTD's filming crew and it full of whackjobs. One of the core producers made Rampage.. Don't get your hopes up.
Did I just see a black Targaryen?
Вы видели??!!! Нет, вы заметили?!!! 11 ДОКТОР !!!!! 11!!!! ДОКТОР КТО!!!!!
Hmmm. I know it wasn't HBO's fault that Game of Thrones ended so badly. On the other hand, I haven't been impressed with their shows for a few years now, so I don't have much hope for this series.
I didn't realize how much I missed GoT until I watched this!
Was that Ramsay Bolton’s voice? Wtf
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
It'd refreshing to know that Dumb and Dumber  aren't involved in this.
Will you all just shot up already about GOT ending. It is the greatest television show that has ever been made period. The fact that deanarys did not rule the 7 kingdoms after conquering king's landing should not ruin the show for everyone. Is called life and life happens. Just move on and enjoy this show for Christ sake
What is the difference between HBO and HBO Max ?
It would have been nice to see a single dragon, in the series about The Dance of Dragons, a civil war with dragons as the primary weapon.  "Dreams didn't make us kings" Bran says what now? He did nothing except dream from season 3 onwards.  "200 years before the Fall of the Throne" Brave choice to remind us of that. Brave, but foolish.  Also, fall is accurate, because I'm estimating 1 week before someone shoves Bran's wheelchair down a flight of stairs.  Physically weak, soft-spoken people with no personal power, loyal army or major supporters do not stay king for long. History teaches us that.  Overall - I have no hype to give. I'll give it a go, but season 8 was so overwhelmingly bad that I just can't trust that this will be good. I can't get my hopes up. Literally, I am so predisposed to think it'll be bad, I actually can't be hopeful about it.  Perhaps I'll be wrong. I'd like to be. I'd like to be able to enjoy this world again.
The Doctor will be in House of the Dragon, how nice, great actor.
Can't wait for the Starbucks cup cameo.
Worst ending of all time and this is your comeback? Better be good!
It's too soon.
it looks like exactly the same time period. how is this 200yrs before?
Финал ИП был максимально ужасный, до сих пор больно. Но! Меня обнадёживает то, что пока они шли по книге, всё было круто. У этого спин-оффа есть шансы стать удачным, так как есть книга, и очень даже хорошая.  Меня она впечатлила, и даже немножко отвлекла от осознания, какое днище финал сериала. Буду надеяться 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
I am still traumatized by the ending of game of thrones
Retcon the last few seasons of GOT and then we can talk about giving you any money again
I'd see this show but I guess I kind of just forgot about GOT existing
Fajne
Here we go again😅🥲
Will this show be  Harrenhal, Winterfell or Kings Landing???
TO ANSIOSA DEMAIS SOCORRO
''Dreams didn't make me king, my chair did''  -Bran, the broken.
As a bonus...could you redo the last GoT season ...you know while you're at it?
“Dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did.” God I recognize that voice from somewhere it’s so familiar
So many crying babies here about GOT ending, get a life... The problem with people complaining is that they will surely watch House of The Dragon but with the intent of finding all of the things they don't like and say that it's trash.. Well just watch other shows and stop complaining plz, it's not even worth your time
Lost my job during this pandemic and decided to start a channel ... Wish me luckk !!! 😭😭
Is that Matt Smith?   im  suddenly less hopeful.   Is this saga going to know as a "song of dashed hopes"?
Waiting for the next spin-off is Robert's rebellion.
I hope they show at least one scene of Balerion, that giant gives me chills just remembering its size.
Dragons did it? Sorry, no!
I hope that this is everything that game of thrones should have been but it probably won’t be even close so expectations are low. Needs blood gore magic ext it’ll disappoint as usual today’s Hollywood is complete trash!
5 season, 10 episode per each, 17 Dragons, I'm dying to watch the trailer.... just think about how the series would be ❤️
They better start with Aegon and his two hot sisters....
THE SULTAN OF MY HEART IS COMING
GELİYOR GÖNLÜMÜN SULTANI
Waiting for this
You guys realize the people who made game of thrones aren't making this series right?? Stop bringing up the eighth season, get over it, time marches on Diane.
The trust is gone after "... Brann has the best story..."
Ok. Make all seasons, let all of them get a good review, including the last one, then I will watch.
200 years before the worst final season in history.
Everyone really needs to chill out about season 8 and give this new show a much-deserved chance -- don't make the mistake of forgetting how absolutely incredible the first 6 seasons of GoT were
Well... I'm not gonna watch it until I've heard and seen reviews, talking about how good it is. The miserable finale is still in the back of my head. Like half of the people commenting on this.
Finally something great
Umm...  So weren't the Targaryen's incestuous since their time in Valyria, choosing to marry off brothers and sisters to keep their line pure? So..., why are there black Targaryen's? Or are they maybe a vassal house also from Valyria also with purple/red eyes and silver hair?
First redo final season of Got then we will talk
You know it's sad when the first thing I said upon clicking this trailer was, 'Alright, let's get this over with.'
I hope David & Dan ain't involved with this project
Meh.
Omgosh haha so amazing, so much looking forward to it!!! Thank you!
Omgggg sonoyaaaaaaa
...is this a new Dr.Who?
GOT doesn't deserve the second chance.
Watch Matt Smith carry this whole show through to another bad ending.
*don’t care what anyone says I enjoyed season 8 , thank you D&D for bringing ASOIAF to the screen and now we get to watch House Of The Dragon! Can’t wait!*
I’ll never forget ever
Now that we live in a post-creativity era, I didn’t expect anything else.
Do D&D have anything to do with it? If so, no thanks!
This too will hurt at the end...it will hurt so bad when young Luke Velaryon meets the One eye in the sky above Shipbreaker Bay, it will hurt when Blood and Cheese make Queen Haelena choose, and it will hurt when Vhagar rises alone at Rook's Rest, but mostly it will hurt more when the Sheperd shouts, "All the dragons musts needs die!!!!"
Here we go again!

HBO MAX INDIA RELEASE PLEASE CONFIRM
You blew it!!
an arya spin off would've been great...
Uh... I hope that knight who got a sword on his chest didn't died because you know, he is using full plate mail, so no way he would die from a slash or 300 slashes on the chest. Or even a thrust. A longsword cannot pierce a plate armor. And even if it did, there is still the chain mail and the padded armor bellow it.
will they ever regain our the story continue?
결말이나 리메이크해 씨발
Bro if this no nice like game of thrones I will be disappointed
Who is the director
200 Years before the dark times, before David and Dan
nice
AMO HBO!!!  #NÃOPAREM DE FAZER SÉRIES ASSIM!
I did not expect Matt Smith to look good in blonde, can’t wait. 👍
Dreams didn't make us kings, but dragons did
They're gonna make Matt Smith be in this, aren't they?
SOOO many salty mfs down here, god you guys are so cringe. The ending to game of thrones wasn't necessarily fabulous but it wasn't bad either.   EDIT: After thinking about this comment for the last few days, I feel like I have to admit some things. No 8 was definitely not great. They did a lot of things wrong imo. We were actually supposed to have 12 seasons of thrones, but was cut short in part of 8. I can't forgive that. D and D really threw it with 8. But it wasn't so bad that people should just hate the whole series because of it like I have seen so many people doing lately. The rest of the show is near perfect. Those are my extra two cents.
IMPRESSIVE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE PAST AND ONLY CRY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE AN END AS THEY WANTED. get over it, it's a shame
If you want to mix politics, just make the entire House of Stark Black? because why not right? LOL
Why does it have to be blackwashed. I'm Asian and I'm not angry that there isn't a single Asian in the show. It would only make it confusing really... This is already a thumbs down.
Is that Ramsey talking?
The stars have aligned all the way to the end & what an epic ending it is (so don’t worry)!! I have faith in HBO GRRM & Ryan J Condal (and many more of course) in giving us fans a truly magnificent show! And I heard GRRM directed the first episode! Super excited over here!
Can we get 4k please?
Some of these characters from this trailer is gonna die within the first season right?
Spoiler warning.. The first few seasons will be amazing. Then each subsequent season will drop in quality a bit and then the last season will kill your dog.
house of dragons, all about dragons, dragons made us kings....... NOT ONE SINGLE DRAGON IN THE ENTIRE CLIP
Черные Веларионы, вы серьезно?
Oh boy if only we still cared after the terrible final season
Gay of thrones.
me watching this, knowing what happens 200 years after 👁👄👁
Please tell me that Dumb and Dumber have nothing to do with this.
*القرآن هو الملجأ الوحيد في متاهات الحياه 💔🌺فهل من مشجع 💔*
It's like the original game of thrones, but everyone's uglier.
If D and D are the writers producers or anything by involved with this one I refuse to watch it
No, no, I can’t go through the pain again...this one is going to have to miss me!
Game of thrones in Hindi dubbed
Whatever you say, GOT still brings that feeling which no other show can ever bring
Scared because they have even LESS to go off of for this series and we all know what happened the last time Martin wasn’t in charge of the plot line
I will NEVER get over the season finale of GOT....so much so that this prequel does not excite me at ALL!!! I will not allow myself to go on another GOT journey & invest my time and emotions only to be slapped in the face with a HORRIBLE, FLAT ending!!
The Game of Thrones universe lives on 🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
OMG WHY DID I JUST KNOW ABOUT IT
I'm looking forward to
00:29 looks like important character but not so glamorous for such a expected series..
i still remember the DISASTER  of S8 i lost all faith or interest in any GOT related series.
Not intereses after the s8 disaster
Olá, prestigiando seu trabalho. Lindas imagens parabéns " tmj"
I'm waiting 😍💙💜💚
That like bar is too big in my opinion.
Iam waiting for GOT
Those frosted blacks,just wtf,make a new house with blacks
Maybe i'm making mistake, but i'm gonna give them one more chance
The people complaining about the redo previous season still gonna watch this.. that's how it works with dragons..you will watch
am I the only one who dont like that dragon armor? its too much in my opinion... like a disney fairytale
What Bjorn Ironsight and Lagertha are doing in Westeros? 🤔
Dragons didn't make us king,wheelchair did ~ Bran The Broken
I came here for THE DOCTOR!! and oh, dragons, too. Lol
👍
Me: Were you satisfied with GOT's last season? Brain: Nope Me: Will you be watching House of the Dragon? Brain: Oh definitely
Hope it will not disappointed us. Fingers🤞
I can relate to house of Targaryen so much with family & strangers fighting over something that has nothing to do with them smh.
How about you teaser a new season 8?
Where's the dragons, by the way..  I did not see one.. 🙄🙄🙄🙄
After all that has happen Jon snow will always be the king of kings  his ending was another beginning.  Legend
Will we see Sir Duncan the Tall????
Lessgoooo🔥🔥
*People who read the books are going to be the only ones who watch this.*
I hope dumb and dumber doesn’t have any part in this show.
Please come in India
"This world wasn't always so small and petty. Thousands of years ago, while the rest of men prayed to gods, the Valyrians became them."
can't waittt
I hope they do this right
Can’t watch this after the BETRAYAL. They’ll do it again!
That's house of the "dragon" not house of the "dragons" so who are you pointing by dragon? Aegon I Targaryen or balerion?  And the one who was mainly shown was aegon I? Or his blood? Because aegon I was the conqueror of the seven kingdoms not the King and he said "us" of course many people helped him achieving the throne, but ig it was not aegon I
I m not sure to watch it.. they will do the same filth at the end of it like game of thrones...
A girl has no dragons.
Take my money
I don't think they will mess this up since the books are written already.
nope, who is writing? D+D better not have any part. 200 yrs and the look and costumes haven't changed. Bad sign.
O universo de GOT vive 🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
dude im so stoked
As good as it looks I’m sure the IMDB rating will be around 6-7 based on how angry were the viewers from the last episode 😂
u better redeem
حماس مليارررررررر 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nope. Still not over it
Boleh Lah Bantu Full Jam Tayang 🙏😊
those people dont have technological advancement in 2000 years and always use swords and bows...
We will also get to see House Velaryon and House Hightower
Ahh, I see the usage of the Targaryen family wig has a long history...  Seriously can we retire the shoulder length half-up do? Viserys and Rhaegar were ebough.
We are so excited
The final season of GOT made me take a break from certain kinda movies n you guys haven’t explained wtf that was… Now you feel like reopening old wounds I guess? If not then please explain what this is n why we should hold our breaths for it
this serie gonna mend all our wounds, mark my word.
Smack me down and take my money! 🥰
Dude plz be good😔 game of thrones is my life and I pray to god these characters and seasons are as amazing as game of thrones. But that’s gonna be an extremely tough thing to top or keep up with lol.
Bro I’m your big fan
I CANT be the only person who saw Doctor Who in the thumbnail and thought this was a joke
Where is the Tardis?
Is this real or fan-made?
I've missed you all, let the geeking begin
Awww man, we back baby!!
Littlefinger didn’t kill himself!
When next trailer ?
😩😩😩 can wait
"Winter Is coming?" 🤥
does anyone care about this even?
Err... who was in charge of the grammar.....? 😆
DAEMONNNNNNNNN
House of the Dragon 🐉 2022 we gonna started with something good on that year
Nah
Melisandre please cameo in this
Our King is Daemon Targaryen not that Bran The Whoever it is
I guess i will make a guiness world record of watching a teaser. Haha!
Black dude there 🤦‍♂ Fockin politics
The sea snake is now black for some reason
Lol all this drama to conclude with “Aegon Targaryen” retiring like a loser beyond the wall😂😂
I shouldn't be excited but I am
Release in hindi also
I'm just going to add that G.O.T slide into mediocrity was to a great extent started by the production pandering to a vocal online fan base. Commities with their own special interests , have never made anything worthwhile.   The finale was clearly rushed, but the first seasons are suffused with the voice of the author. Its some times crule, hard to watch  not particularly PC and much more literary...its also compelling.   I won't be watching but if HBO have learned anything this must be paramount.
Yall gotta stop worrying about this because of season 8. Not to say this definitely won’t be bad but if it is then it won’t be for the same reasons as season 8 which was bad because of the writers and going past the books. This show is based on a finished book by GRRM and has different writers.
Gods, Kings, Fire and blood.
Let’s just skip the disappointment and not watch it
If I hear someone says "mah kween!" on this show, that's a sign I need to stop watching.
Prince phillip?
This looks really, really... bad. 😬
I'm sure it's going to be garbage... Just being real. I'm also sure that it's going to be very political and racial as well.
Did they race swap some of the Targaryans?
Are you kittem me right meow
GOT had the worst ending in history and is still the best tv show in history. Underrated
Ohhhh snap!!!! Yasssss👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 REDEEM YOURSELF!!
Dr who? Dr Targaryen
A reason to trust this series won’t be like season 8.  George rr martin has actually written the source material for this! Fire and blood is a brilliant read so they have the source material to make this great.
Everyone butthurt about GoT finale, please stfu.
Ahh yes, bring on the incest. Medieval fantasy is nothing without it.
So much butthurt, jeeez. You'd think all the people who watched the finale actually had family in King's Landing when Daenerys burned it. Get a life, people
nedd stark ❤️
I really don't think I can watch this after that terrible last season. I used to really enjoy GOT, but season 8 ruined all the good work that had been put in and I have little to no love for this franchise anymore.
Game of thrones franchise? No thank you
Looks like a copy paste of game of thrones. They even used the same set.
Gods... Kings... The Doctor.
Spin offs are never as good as the main show and we all know what happened there
Imagine how much money HBO could print if they didn't F up the final season
fun movie
But of course, black, chinese and polynesian gay Targarynes, because everything has to be politically correct and equally represented. How about ...No?
I'm trying so hard to love it..  This teaser looks nothing but DD production Please don't fk up another book...
Now they are going to make a sequel of each house watch
lol 2022 you muss be mad
lol, when i see GOT anywhere, i remember the word  ' SEASON 8 ' XD
You cant prove that this isnt the 11th Doctor's Reincarnation.
All this only for 'bran the broken' to be king...the fans remember.
any doctor who fans here who are just extremely happy for matt smith
Lets see how many people came here to see this masterpiece trailer😍
I love Matt Smith
It should say “ 200 years before game of thrones was destroyed by 2 incompetent writers”
Lo estoy esperando no puedo soportar ya quiero más juego de tronos.
im not feeling excited caz im sure its gonna be another pay to watch series of Netflix so....not cool oh and we don't have Netflix here. BOOOM 😐
GOT already caused me so much pain, can't go through it again....
Personally, I'm tired of hearing about the targs. We have them in the main books, the show, dunk and egg and one history book with another on the way. Plus with the clear woke casting, I'm gonna have to pass on Keeping up with the Targaryens.
We want hindi dub
Can’t say I’m excited, but who knows… they should fix the final season.
❤️❤️❤️
Love these comments. GoT's ending was so bad it ruined any chance of this show succeeding.
after disgusting season 8 and then just ignoring it, i dont want to be a part of GOT
What the black guys are doing in the westeros? This is not garlem
Oh, this show will be out and finished before the winds of never comes out
House of the Dragon, starring Ramin Djawadi
Amazing!! I’m so stoked jajaja. I was just talking about GoT to a friend of mine & I find this on my newsfeed. Can’t wait
is that ramsay bolton narrating
I really hope that this isn't awful
I'm excited to not watch this
Richard Madden’s voice. So  Rob Stark was reincarnation in the throne but just to have the throat slashed ?
No, thanks
Aaaah yes, the black Targaryen, just like in the books... Jfc.. How bout adding black UNIQUE characters instead of replacing white ones? Ah yes, what am I saying, that would require some ORIGINALITY instead of woke bs.
Who cares anymore?
burned once...never again.
Still sour from the last season of GOT. boycott this trash
Matt smith what are you doing here
SENCILLAMENTE LO AMO
I'll give it a shot, unlike the idiots who are still hung up from 2 years ago.
Ok guys time to remedy the ending of GoT I hope, brace yourselves, I'm excited
Let's make a series of a story we already know the miserable ending of. 😕
Can't wait
You guys seriously need to stop making dead shows. Come up with something new. You guys already failed in the last season of this series, why would you pretend you will have success with this one?
Subtítulos en español por favor
I have a bad feeling about this...
That sword has a seven-pointed star on the pommel so im guessing its not blackfyre right? If it is i hope they provide good reasoning for that
It's 2021, so I'm sure this is trash
N moment
HBO: Destroys GOT finale.  Also HBO: We're sorry... so here's a GOT reboot ...
فخامه احس اتذكرت ايام الثرونز 😥♥️
lol Of course they couldn't let go of the cash cow.
After the last two seasons, this leaves a bad taste in my mouth
Nobody wants this. Yes, we are all still sour. No, I don't think its HBOs fault. Screw you D&D.
its about time
Waiting 🔥😍
HBO.... Be like Marvel Develop something like "WHAT IF"
Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did Daenys the dreamer, Brynden rivers, Bran: Yeah about that...
House of the dragon series should end with Robert's rebellion as the final season with all the GoT characters.
Harry potter fellings
I'll wait until after it's over instead of getting invested from the start this time
Crossover with Doctor Who with the TARDIS that will kill all dragons and the eleventh doctor that will take the throne as like the tenth take the throne of England marrying Elizabeth the first😂🤔
Is there 3 headed dragon in house of the dragons
Are there gonna be some transgender rights in this one somewhere?
Doctor Who returns!!!
Fire and Blood ♥️
The finale of GoT is one of biggest let downs of my life, I was so disappointed in what they did but would I watch this?   *YES*
If you listen closely at 0:56 you can hear a dragon growling.
Give us the snydercut of season 8
If the original series made an absolute mess with the caracthers and the script, I can't even imagine how broken this will be...
GÒZ  KINKS  FÆÅ  bLàD
Not even going to invest the time to pirate this crap
الثرونزيه العربيه مرو من هنا😎😎🤟
Firstly we want remake of season 8........... Then we want this............ Otherwise you are doing some shit.............
Its will be great
I only have netflix but will subscribe to HBO for this one idc whatt yall say ✨
I have see any web series first time - Game of thrones. I loved that but ending is very bad. Please if possible then make season 9 of GoT. 😭😭
https://youtu.be/aLWZDJ2csDM
🔥🔥🔥
I'm just here to say you screwed up last season of GoT and I'm not going to watch House of Dragon for fear of another disappointment.   I will not forgive you for that failure. Peace.
Maybe this might help audiences forgive that final season? We shall see.
all you have to do is to dislike it
12 million in one week 🔥🔥 For sure fire will reign
So we always got nothing on HBO GO Asia 😭 What the f**k
I am amped!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am ready!
Where are the dragons ? Asians, blacks - yeah.. I hope that among the Targaryens will not noone no-white.  Haha, best wishes.
Can't wait for this to flop
Looks good. What a pity that nobody cares anymore.
You are all forgetting that this leads up to the last four seasons of GoT.  Gullible fools.
If this is bad it will irreparably destroy the legacy of GOT.
Nope - not gonna take a chance on this. I'm tired of getting all wrapped up in a great series (da vinci's demons, the gifted, the magicians, etc.) and then seeing them cancelled after two seasons.  Or worse, seeing them end up like GoT.
Look forward to you messing this up again and I Can't wait
I am waiting! 🥰🥰🥰
It's like her message after she ghosted ...... nothing happend u kidding me
Sadly they seem to be technologically on par with GoT 😞 They could've gone a bit more early to high medieval...
Cool and all, but where’s the apology for season 8? Should move more on that before anything else
Ugh
After the disastrous GOT ending i want to stay as far as possible of this clusterfu...
At lease Dumb & Dumber are not involved in this, I might give it a chance
I can't compare it to the last GOT.😒 FIRE & ICE has a better cast.😁
I wish to see Balerion the dread
They should also get David Tennant for this too. Let him be a knight or something.
Who else can’t wait for 2022? 😜
If someone does not die for a chicken, I am not watching.

"I don't want it", but..

the new season of Dr. Who looks strange
I think there might be a lot of people being burned alive in this series.
Apa saya doang orang Indonesia yang nonton ini?
We didn't start the fire 🎶🎶
Hopefully they don’t ruin the last season of this one!!!! I can’t handle it again 🤦‍♀️🙄
Every one is forgetting the reason s8 sucked so bad was because there was no source material.  DnD just kind of did their own thing.  We all KNOW what's going to happen during the dance of dragons because we have the full story. Not saying it can't be fucked up bc it can, but I have high hopes.
Cant wait it! Im so excited 😍😍😍
bet itfaceplants just like GOT 😂
I’m still waiting for a final season re-do and that just being some part of someone’s coma dream or some shit.
Syrio Forel!
very nice movie....
Does this series have the same directors and writers of the last season of GOT?
Yeah but, is there enough gays, gender dysphoric, and black people in the series? Did anyone ask these super important  entertainment questions?!??
Its like the time my dad left to get ice cream, then came back 10 years later without ice cream.
Game of Throne.. Next ver??? How are you going to end this series??? like Game of throne season 8???
I love you young Rhaenyra Targaryen
They’re really putting that larger budget to work. The set designs, costumes and props already look amazing.
re contra sape
Obligatory comment about how the first dragon show didn’t end the way I wanted and I’m still angery about it cuz Jon and Dany were shipped by me
Thanks God! 😭❤️
In 2022 people will start cracking their eggs hoping that it will turn into dragons.
Нгры, Млдр. Нгры!
House of the dargon please release tamil
You know, George R.R Martin could’ve spent more time on finishing his books, instead, he helped with this, which is probably garbage like the last 2 seasons of GoT.
A black Targeryan man? Wtf? :)

This is either going to save or decisively break HBO.  The other series should have kept going at least another 5 years....
Why do mail targaryen always have to have such short hair Daemon should have longer hair
It would be decent but since the woke mob has hands on it it’s not gonna make sense
I really don't see the point of this show at all.
naa still cant watch this, im still in rage of how ya'll ruined GoT,  FU >:c
The last few seasons of GOT ruined the whole franchise. Here comes "The Dragon Show"part two.
200 years before the worst finale EVER.
I love Game of Thorne
WoW can't wait!
Fuck this show……. After what game of thrones did I wont spend another second on anything related to this brand
Dracarys ☺💋🎫
A shame Game of Thrones got cancelled after 4 seasons But at least we got a spin-off now !
I have really high hopes for this one just cause I am hearing that George R.R. Martin is going to be very involved in this. If it was those two other douche bags D&D I wouldn't even bother getting HBO again.
Not watching it...
A series based on a series based on an unfinished series of books written by someone who is going to either wank or eat himself to death before he can finish them.  Yeah, sign me up!
It must be good right..? They seriously cannot afford to fail or flop this one. Then GoT will be out the window for many, many, many years to come.
But the question is: is she your Queen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kUe1gQ0Q7U
Kinda look like the lasy knockoff version of a show that pooped the bed...
🎵 I'm only gonna break, break your  break, break your heart  *appropriate soundtrack*
I’ve lost faith honestly
😲💣💥
GOT is like that hot girl that stayed over for a hot steamy weekend, but destroyed your toilet bowl before she left in the morning. Now she just drunk texted: "You up?" Aaaauuhhh shit, here we go again...

" Dreams didn't make us king, Dragons did "
looks nice, but when you will remake the last season of game of throne but with a good Script?
Anyone else watching this for the 15-20th time? 😂
All this for bran to become king at the end
Sigh, now these bozos at HBO are going to beat the game of thrones dead horse........ugh.
well im into it
Really hope we see an old Balerion before he dies of old age.
I'm good, just throw the whole thing away.
Am I the only one on earth that feels Game Of Thrones had the perfect ending? I didn't want it to end like that. But remember the earlier seasons where there was a surprise after every corner. Well, that was a surprise ending. 🧙‍♂️🥺Dany, tho.
They should try to fix the season 8 finale like how Dexter is doing with new blood.
Please released Hindi dubbed official 🇮🇳
You can tell the ending's going to be pants already!!
Any aegon targaryan fans🔥
After bad season 7 and terrible season 8, im highly suspicious, to say the least.
I miss game of thrones
OOOOHHHH YAESSSS WAITING FOR THIS
'An' HBO original series? Should that be A?
Chills
Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did.
Who is the writer? I won't invest my time and emotions to this if those idiots are still with you.
lets hope for the producers to don't fuck the end of show this time.kkk
Nonsense
Hopefully they got some showrunners who actually want to see the project through instead of being distracted by new shiny ideas from the House of Mouse.
I don’t think the pain of GOT is old enough for me yet.
Que seja bomm
This looks so stunning and brave.
Scrap S8 and I might subscribe again..  You really fu**ed your fans with that season!
🔥🔥🔥 wait for ramin djawadi

This was great, can’t wait to get back into the swing with ASOIF. Can’t come soon enough.  House Of The Dragon Trailer Talk! ☀️ https://youtu.be/OlytC3CfBwI
Jon should’ve  been king 😐
Minus the NightKing ending and the fact that seasons 7 and 8 felt rushed because of the lack of source material, I thought the ending was fine.  Can’t wait for this show! Reading all the books now. Lol
Please streem in official Hind please HBO MAX
They're like a whole alien species. Can't wait!
Fool me once, strike one. Fool me twice, strike three- Michael Scott
Τσουτσούριασα
Huh, it looks like the throne is actually more accurate to the books!
Yasssssss
I'm not paying $10 a month for that lol
Hmmm, could this finally shed light to where Drogon took Dani? 🤔🤔🤔
Just a continuation of how the last season of GoT was, garbage, period.
I just want to see the fight of Targeryan Prince idunno and the Hammer Fat King and many warriors that they said "HE'S SO STRONG BACK THEN" type of guys
I can't stop seeing
Thanks to the fantastic ending of Game of Thrones, I have zero interest in watching this prequel. And pretty much everyone I know is in the same boat. Good job, HBO.
we....dont....care....
I am not going to waste my time...waiting for a new episode or new season...Going to watch it all when its all released and finished ..
Spoiler: In the end the hive mind of the Children of the Forest wins and gets back the land that was stolen from them.
Ohh yeah I'm hyped 👌👌
I hope that House of The Dragon can redeem Game of Thrones after that horrific final season same as how The Mandoloreon redeemed Star Wars after that last jedi trainwreck🤞🤞
"Dreams didn't make us kings" had it not been for dreams the targaryens would have never survived the doom of valyria let alone become kings
no thanks game of thrones was utter garbage i dont want to see this shit ever again
Isso está muito bom, HBO Max está vindo com tudo mesmo. Vou acompanhar sim, o universo de Game of Thrones vive 🔥🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yeah… no. You ruined ASOIAF for me. I’ve waited a nearly a decade for winds of winter and thanks to the catastrophe of a show I won’t even be finishing the books.(not like he will ever finish them) I’m completely out on this you can’t fool me again HBO. I advise anyone else that dislikes having their time wasted to follow suit.
GOD ABOVE MEN  Dragons do make us Kings, not  "did" make us Kings; Present Kings.
Omg I am screaming
Black dude ?
The last 4 seasons were so trash I ain't bothering to watch this.
OMG, my fav tv series ever in my life, grow up together with GOT, Will wait u buddies
The Doctor
No intro comes closer to GOT's theme song .
guys
meh
Please old session all part hindi dubbed please 🙏🙏🙏
I love games of thornes  series but note hindi dubbed 😭😭😭
We will see a lot more silver haired targaryen killing each others 😂 ooooppps spoilers
Excited to watch this prequel but so far I'm not very happy with the casting.
Can't wait 😍😍😍
First the botched last seasons of GoT, then HBO dropped the ball by not picking up Jane Goldman's spinoff. But hey let's pick up the prequel series so we can cram as many easter eggs and wink wink's in this to avoid going in a daring new direction. Sorry but this looks like the worst seasons of GoT (s05-08) to behonest: all battles and zero drama or politics. No doubt this'll find an audience, but I'm not buyin' the Kool Aid.
I can't wait to invest my time and be let down at the end like game of thrones...
Making prequels so that we will be more thirsted to the sequel.. I hate you
Just dont bore me. Thats all im asking.
No don't do that. Don't give me hope 😢
You still haven't learned the lesson about lighting?
Omg!
I’ll miss Tyrion’s Witt.
I don’t have any expectations for this new GOT season not only because the final season of GOT but also I have already given my heart to my Khaleesi. It’s very weird to see so many Targaryens at the same time. I will watch it without any prejudgment.
It doesn't matter how much we hate GOT ending but we will glued to it when ep 1 will air
Bring back the nudity.
How often do I watch this now? 🤔
I know a lot of people were disappointed at the end of season eight for Game of Thrones but personally I got exactly what I wanted Daenerys got fucking killed and that’s exactly what needed to happen even though everything else was sort of shoveled out to the side she had to die and that was the most important part
My heart is racing as I'm waiting for this series just wish I could wait till at least 3 seasons are released coz it will end in tears if I watch only one season 😅
My favorite got character margaery  Maharaj king Jeffrey  and tyrion lannister
stark fans now...🤒🤒🤒🤒
u still giving chances to them after what u watched? LMAO
“Dreams didn’t make us Kings, Dragon did”   - Duke of Edinburgh
We want to see KHALEESI
Nah - I'll stick with The Wheel of Time, thanks!
i just notice the iron throne look different
House of the dragon…. Sound Chinese !
Since when the targarians became black... Jesus, why do you have to screw it all up?!
Peter dinklage is recasted. Coming back as mushroom.
This reminds me. Absolutely nothing mattered in the end and Jamie's death was stupid.
hope this time we wont see a terrible end like you guys did in game of thrones, destroyed the interest at last.
yooo matt smith let's fucking goo
definite shitshow
I’ve watched Game of Thrones multiple times, I’ve watched the making of and animated history and lore. I’m currently reading the books but I’ve also bought the Fire and Blood book which this is based on. I can’t tell you how excited I am to watch what will be another masterpiece.
Pass.
But......I cant forget game of throne
I don't think I can even watch this. I'm sitting here with this pissed off knot in my stomach after what they did. Almost insulted they think they can come back after what the fuck they did.
Can’t wait to watch the first 7 seasons of this
YEEEEEES iwe been waiting ont his they making the taregyn story into a series DONT LET US DOWN HBO hope they do the action scenes and such from the books justice
🙉🙉🙉🙉
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS!!! I WAS ALMOST READY TO MOVE ON 😂
Ok you got my attention again HBO
Geliyor gelmekte olann 🥳
S8 killed the franchise for me.
Ooh boy, no one cares.
Looks good, but I'll wait until some reviews are in
make sure you got the coof poke card ready
🔥🔥🔥🔥🤞🤞
The amount of grown people still commenting on season 8 of GoT is too funny to me. I didn't love it either, but at the end of the day it's just a show lol. Not sure about this casting, but still excited for it! 🐲
How comes both white dude and black dude be born in one family??  Is it the power of POLITICAL CORRECTNESS?
In all honsety this looks like camel shit. Not only the special effects cut my poor eyes, but also the casting is a total garbage as well, nowhere near as good as the original cast.
It was a huge mistake what HBO did to us, viewers. "Don't sh*t where you eat" But they exactly did it. No more trust in you!
I kinda want to watch it … but I’m scared it’s going to suck … 😢
Who did that voiceover?
Can't wait..
Wooh Wwowww ❤️
Just dont fck this one up hbo
You really had to kick a dead horse....smh!!!
Why some Targaryen are black?
So that's what Prince Phillip did before he met Queen Elizabeth.
Black Targaren 😂
95 % of the budget spent on sets and CGI. 4 % in casting. 1 % in scripts and writing.
If daeny came alive in game of thrones nxt season
The next like brow The next like brow The next like brow Semangatt gotong royong 🙏
https://youtu.be/EeYeOOQi2pg
Cant wait to waste 7 years of my life only to be Tokyo sandblasted by the ending all over again.
Ah shit here we go again
pls upload trailer in 4k D;
Can’t wait to see what Aegon “kind of forgot about” in the final season that costs him one of his dragons.
FUS RO DAH
Чёт негров мало
this is like the tv equivalent of when you start a new project before you properly finished the old one
Alright. How quickly are they going to fuck it up?
I so don't care lol
Naah.. thanks for the heart break from before., don’t need it again..
watching the rage about the final season will be more enjoyable . i am skipping all and waiting for the last season
Looks low budget. Looks disgustingly politically woke. Can't make good movies in liberal fascist america.
Burn them All!!! Mad King said!
Where is his bowtie? Or a fez?
Please tell me this is not written by D n D
Game of thrones is back in new form "HOUSE OF THE DRAGON" 😊😊😊
Track name pleaseeee
how come hbo's targaryens are always ugly? the witcher is the closest thing to rhaegar i've ever seen. i don't feel like watching this
https://youtu.be/0cgbZqR2AGI
Black targaryens lmao
"Kings, Queens, Dragons, Dwarves. Horses, Fortresses, Magic, and Swords."
Reminds of the crap ending my Dany got..
If Hey Big head was a TV show
ohh here we go again......
Doctor Zoidberg prescribes direct applications of salt for those horrendous burns. Let's begin, shall we?
I guess the 11th Doctor didnt really die... Just got stuck with other people playing D&D
Where is dragons? 😢😢😢
Talk about a no name cast. Where did they find these people??
So Game of Thrones but without GRRM? Yeah I'm gonna have to pass. Once the show passed the books it was straight dumpster juice
....dreams didn't make kings.......incest did. "Begins to play sweet home Alabama because of the amount of incest in house targaryen"
Please realise in india hindi language
Ramin djawadi is a legend
The Doctor REALLY went a little mad after Amy huh?
Tão deixando agente sonhar
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Y’all need to redo season 8 first 😭
This looks like it's going to kick so much ass
I've never watched one GOT episode so idk why this kept coming up on my feed. Sorry y'all's, I'll waste my time doing other things
Humko maloom hai tum phir se kaat doge!!
Sing it! - ONE WIENER NEXT TO ANOTHER WIENER!!!
I have very low expectations for this, but hopefully I’m wrong
nah dude you are going to fck things again. we don't trust yoy anymore.....
Nah.
I'm a little iffy about the writers who messed up the ending maybe getting a chance to write the whole story - the character of GoT needs to be maintained, but you also need to think in terms of... What do people really like (and not hurry things too much or do random things that you think are cool, that the audience maybe doesn't think are cool)  Viewers don't watch because "an artist created art". Viewers watch because it has characteristics they like.
i still have season 8 in my mouth and no longer care cause i know how it ends .
After the prequel ends they should reboot game of thrones and start in season 7.
I can’t trust this show anymore
Season 8 still hurts so bad!
Notice how there are many melted swords near the throne like the books depicted.
2222 or 2022?  With Covid and all, I'm concerned there has been a mix up with the show taking place 200 years prior to the fall of the Throne and the date of release.
Still no violet eyes kinda sucks.
Praying already for a better ending
What??? where is travis? this is bull#@$#
I’m Soo annoyed right now. WTH YOUTUBE?! This should have been recommended IMMEDIATELY to me…I’m just now seeing this? Is something wrong with your algorithm?!
Not all of us getting invested in this knowing exactly where the Targaryen legacy will end. All this work and build up and bleached Jeffree Star hair just to end in a 'SHE IS MUH QUEEN.' Like, I want to try for it... I'm thinking we should approach it like a historical film, like Marie-Antoinette or something where we know she's going to lose her head but we want to root for her anyway. Or Titanic, where we know that ship will sink but we think, maybe this time, if we pay close attention, we can will the ending to change. I don't know. I think I'll hang back and roam around Assassin's Creed Valhalla for my medieval fantasy vibe for now.
Looks like a carbon copy of GoT
Their hair looks so dry and crispy; they need a hot oil treatment and some bobby pins. Village of the Damned lookin' MFers. Legolas would never. Where is Brad Mondo? He's needed in King's Landing.
The only show with incest that I don't mind
"Dreams didn't make us kings... Bleach by Loreal did. Try new Ultra Strip Non-Peroxide Hair Bleach for when you desperately need to erase the bad color left after Season 8."
I want to enjoy this, but is it possible to compartmentalize the whole D&D season 7-8 fiasco?  I thiiiink HBO learned something…
Dracarys
What was once the GOAT and turned in to the  biggest piece of $hit. Why bother trying to make A spin off. Atching this just makes me remember the bad times
Hard pass. Game of Thrones is a dead IP.
As, long as D & D don't touch this it should be cool. Full fairness they were good before rushing that final season.
Ok, but where Are the dragons?
They should admit they ruined the ending to GOT and remake it properly. None of this cash grab garbage.
Ok, gracias por el trailer pa no verla
dont have courage to see this after GOT s8 disaster.
And how this is going to end?? Just keep Dumb&Dumber as far awy from this as possible and maybe I'll try watching
I’m excited for the bad ending. . and so are you!
Just keep David Benioff and D.B. Weiss as far away from this as possible
Watch everyone get tricked by D&D again, I ain't getting fooled twice now. However it does look good like all trailers nowadays.
People in the comment : FuCkiNg tRash  When the drama release : NO.1 trending in the world.
😳 What does it mean???!!!
Heres hoping that this show will have many of the other houses involved like the Starks Mormonts etc.. Could be great if they do that and not only make it about dragons..
Honestly game of thrones wasn't that great I know so many people who just watched the show as it was trending
Is Matt Smith Aegon?????
pls don't fuck this up for us🥺
The Doctah travelled to much far this time
I just want to see a bunch of white haired people riding dragons.
I‘m not getting into this again
Dreams didnt make us kings she mah queen did
Wuuaaaaa  que emocion,  por fin he esperado tanto, que ya quiero que se pase el tiempo .
matt smith? they're just cheating now
who cares at this point, RIP season 8
Yeah right, for what they've done to GOT, they still think people going to watch this...
No one will ever replace daenerys  Season 8 still got me fcked up
I seriously cannot wait!!!!!
I just hope it's woke and diverse.  And virtue signals.
The excited fully 🍕🍿☕️
i see nothing here. hmm not even baited to watch this one.
Shit looks like a cosplay drama🤣😬
Yo it’s doctor who!!!
I'm nervous
With fire and blood , THEY REIGN HBO MAX ONCE MORE
it's like the old saying: "fool me once, shame on you, but teach a man to fool me, and I'll be fooled for the rest of my life."
NAHHHH......We didn't forget what happened HBO....this is trash😒 YOU GOT BEEF WIT ME YOU GOT BEEF WIT ME 4EVA
I hope they don't ruined it like Got.I think daenerys targaryen childhood would be shown here...
I just... don't care. Yall killed it with that crap yall pulled with the last seasons.
boooooooo
After that disappointment with GOT and so many stuff left unresolved, not a chance, I'll pass.
"Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did."  Just to clarify, Daenys the Dreamer's dreams saved House Targaryen from the Doom of Valyria. What made the Targaryens kings was when Aegon the conqueror and his sisters unleashed their dragons upon Westeros and conquered six kingdoms in a single year. Dreams ensured their survival while dragons put crowns on their heads.
0:37 ORNSTEIN IS THAT YOU????? or am I crazy...
so will the ending be shit like the previous one?
I’m conflicted
Read the room HBO, you lost the crowd years ago.
nope. redo the GoT ending and i’ll think about it
I am legitimately excited for this. The ending of Game of Thrones in my opinion was not as bad as a lot have claimed. It could have been better for sure, but it could have also been 10x worse. People need to understand that they ran out of material because the Author of the books literally took forever to finish. I would have liked a better ending for sure, but it was not as horrible as a lot of other shows. Cough cough lost.....   I also find myself using HBO Max more than any other streaming service the last couple of months. Absolutely amazing quality of content. Around Christmas time though, all my attention will be on Netflix. Stranger Things, Witcher, Last Kingdom, etc. Disney Plus will have Book of Bobba Fett. I am curious what HBO will have for Christmas time.
Yes the anticlimactic ending from the show just makes me not care about this honestly but there was a spark in my heart a very small one .
House Velaryon is of Valyrian descent, and its members often have Valyrian features, such as silver hair, purple eyes, and pale skin.
YAAAY! Looking forward to get disappointed again
Welp!!!! We all know how it ends. With a fkn disappointment of course
I’ll be waiting and seeing the episode previews afterwards. Not wasting my time on this franchise anymore.
Omggggg I got chills so excited!
It's gonna be super woke, isn't it 😔
Oh look, Elric
I'm sure the biggest question is "is D&D part of this in any way?" ha
All Yall need to get over Season 8. It wasnt as bad as you all make it out to be. Yes, it COULD have been better, and i will never say season 8 didnt have its flaws and rushed storylines, but most of you are just mad it didnt end the way your fanfiction wanted it to end
Miguel Sapochnik is the showrunner... the guy who directed the long night.. Says enough about the low quality we will get
Black Targaryens?
Is that... Kate McKinnon?
If it's gonna ends the same as GOT let us know from now, we're not ready for another heart break again !
I'm not feeling good about this show
I will only watch the fight scenes with the "Sword of The Morning" in it.
too short, actually almost no info
I like when shows have characters who become powerful and then are ruined, but GOT found a way to make the show itself follow that arc instead.  I guess they're getting ready to repeat that now
Can't wait to watch it for 8 years and then D&D tell me to go to hell, thanks HBO I'm gonna pass.  I am a slow learner but I learn from my mistakes.
The best thing about this money grab.. is i know its a money grab. so ill watch from afar but wont fvlly invest cause i know the storys been overly inflated.  But who cares anyway.. art is dead to me now.. in all its forms but none more than film..
MY MAN MATT SMITH!!!!!
Really hoping not to get sucked back into this. I am worried HBO will mess this up & break my heart again.
Just.. the acting choice.. no.. ugh.. tragic..
WE
Hoping they leave the woke shit out of this.... But I am not holding my breath. TV has been dead for years now... only audience they care about are feminist's
House of the woke*
8 seasons and still haven't fixed your lighting problem, eh HBO?
House of Stark is still better
Why so many dislikes? This movie seems very exciting. I will absolutely watch this movie. Thank you for creating this movie 😊
For everyone bitching here after GOT Season 8 (which is mediocre, no doubt), did the Disney Star Wars trilogy kill the hype of The Mandalorian? No, it fucking didn't. So stop the bitching.
what a weird doctor who episode
❤🔥
idk, i think directors will screw up this show ending too.
fuckkkkkkkkkkk I cant wait!!!!! <3
Why the Targerian guy looks like the Witcher 😁
Don’t watch it. The end is probably shit.
This will be shit too
Pass
So this serie will explain us the story about how the Doctor did became king of the Western Continent? Interesting....
I am watching again GOT And I am on season 1 episode 5. Man it still haunts me every second I watch. Ned stark didn't deserve the way his family ended. The journey of a teenage girl Denarays Targaryen doesn't deserve the ending. Its just haunt how they can end this like that.
Well the last series failed because they ran out of book chapters so this series that doesn’t have any books at all should turn out great!
should not have had a bad ending for g.o.t,  we now know you will prolong each season .and then decide to randomly cancel the show and go against everything written and make a horrible illogical ending ..
GOT Season 8 never forget.
with how bad the writing was at the end of the last show and how SJW Hollywood has been this is prob going to be terrible
The legend of azor ahai might be true after all House of the dragon might save us from the darkness got ending caused
FFS , didnt we have enough of the fucking targeryans ??? or however the fuck is it written. Why not interesting characters like young Tywin for example ? ........ ignoring this
Dat black Targariens... Can't wait for this disgrace
I knew it!! The doctor was behind all of the things in Westeros!
The sour january regrettably succeed because divorced neuropathologically unite via a wet craftsman. ignorant, well-to-do editorial
LMFAO! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.
Dark skinned Valyrians? Yeah right...
Lilibeth!
I have a feeling it’s gonna be a huge disappointment for whatever reason...  PS. - You forget the dragons from this little snippet but I guess it’s enough as long as some semi creepy dude whisper about them.
Well, seems like this serie already lost my interest by forcing a black cast for the sake of inclusion. Cancer.
I love how the Targaryen knight's armor looks similar to the artworks of Justin Sweet's drawing of the battle of the trident.
This show will hurt us too lol
I would rather watch The Wonder Years reboot than this pile of worthless tripe, and I'm *not* watching that woke version of recycled refuse.
I'm holding out hope that this has the same quality as earlier seasons of GOT and not the final season.
The Last seasons of game of thrones i don't liked me i hope this will be better.
This is like the announcer blaring: “he’s ok folks”, after they put him in the ambulance without medical support and a cloth covering from head to toe.
HBO you do understand that Valyrians were basically Nazis with dragons right? 😂
Max Smith is Witcher?
I’ll never watch HBO again after what they did to that gem 💎 of a show. I can’t believe they let the writers ruin it in one season
I want to see the supernatural part of GOT more. Targ history is basically incest, religious protest against incest, then prophecy for more incest 😂.
will you poop in your hand and throw it to the face of every fans of the show?
How are people still crying over a non cannon ending? Didn't bother me, because I knew better 😂
Bran: dreams didnt make me king, ravens did!
Efsane kaldığı yerden başlıyor
After going back and rewatching all the GoT seasons I’ve realized that it’s mostly boring. There’s at least 1 filler episode per season and the series finale was complete garbage.
Baforaaaaaaaa
Please, please, dont fuck it up.
E lá vamos nós ...😎
Don't tell me! It will last for another 8-10 years until the producers will get bored and finish it up abruptly with Bran closing up the book where he wrote this history after he became king.
Dragons didn't do it, THE DOCTOR DID!
Can't get excited about this after the way you did us with the last few seasons of GOT. Ruined everything forever.
If it wasn't HBO Max and I didn't have to pay for it, maybe, otherwise, re-do Season 8 first.
a sequel is never as good as the original
Targaryan the civilization with the fairest skin and hair has some really dark skinned people there.
This show honestly could put respect back on the thrones name
How DARE they.
Ah sh*t here we go again...
bekliyoruz, bekliyoruz
Black washing at it again! Disgusting!
All the shit of earth was in GOT season 8. Still smells...
Me: After GOT's disappointing climax I hope they get this one right. Also me: I shouldn't look excited but I'm looking forward to this one 🤓
Is that doctor who?
It feels like it's going to be a huge ask to get us interested and invested in another brand new batch of characters after how badly we were burned last time.
Couldn't care less about GoT, never watched it. I'm here for Smith, and I am pumped
Mat smith is one of my favourite actors
Why are so many happy about this!! Yes ok there is a part to me that would love to see it but I'm still heartbroken to this day with how they ended things on season 8💔  worst ending iv ever seen!!!! Season 8 should be scrapped and done again and I don't care how much it costs!!! They fucked up so they should fix it!!! But oh wait I should be happy about this should I!!👎 Even the actors themselves said they were shocked with the script they had for the last season👎 no GoT should be done until they fix what they did!!! But it's all about money 👎 they don't give a fuck!! I truly pray that the fan base this series once had doesn't turn up for this 👌I even had Longclaw tattooed on me a week before the last season came out I was so buzzing and then I watched it 💔💔💔 no forgiveness for this unless they do the right thing!!!
Prince Phillip?!
It's like my ex telling me she's a changed person and I should give her a second chance
HBO: Hey look, another great story to shit on. LET'S GO!
“Fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.”  - G. Bush
What’s the point?…We already know how the house of the dragon ends.
CHOOSE YOUR PLAN!
not gonna watch this one.
I don't give a single fuck about this, blame GOT's final shitty seasons
Don't give a fuck, fix the ending!
Depends on who the writer and producer is
🤭 i see 👊🏽 people , come on inclusion
they screwed up GOT so they can only make prequels
The mad king would be proud of his lil daughter.
Seems like Dr. who ended up in the wrong timeline again
Idc what people say, GOT last season was nothing short of amazing and this looks super duper cool as well! Lets gooo Tar'gs!!
Not how I imagined Aegon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Hopefully, those who watch will be those who watch later.. amen
They aren’t even trying to hide that it’s ripped off the Targaryens in Game of Thrones
I feel tempted to watch this just so I can see what ways to fuck it up you can come up with.
The doctor? Nice
I'll only watch this if GRRM was involved or they stuck to the source material. Not interested in overproduced garbage like the shit D&D put out
what's doctor who doing here XD
lol it's sucks
According to GM Valyrians were white, you're pc ignorants
"Hello. I am the doctor. Basically, run"
Well, this is going to suck
Please don't hurt us (in a bad way) again.
Tarık Mengüç is a Targeryan
I love the crybabies who were so hurt by GOT!!!  lololol  you know you're going to watch this too. You'll hate on it and spend lots of time online complaining! LOLOL  I am so here for it!  Plus, I bet the show will be fun. Remember? This is just fantasy fun, not some tragedy in real life because you decided the show made you mad. Peace out, kids! lolololol
Can someone turn on the lights? Kinda hard to see
😱 OMG I WAITING THIS SERIES
💪DIVERSITY💪
SPINOFF SEASON BOYS
Na fuck this shit, ¿where's My tlou trailer?
Show hasn’t even come out yet and it’s already the fifth most popular show this past week on IMDB.
Remember guys, that the makers of the Game of Thrones series probably noticed the disappointment, so I assume they really put effort to step up their game... I hope
Fuck this shit for ending of GOT
Everyone is saying not interested or not excited but as a GOT Fan I needed this to forget the mess of season 8 asap😌
Who ever the show runners are, please just follow the script on this story. Flawless, don’t fuck it up and you’re good.
Dragon made the thorne dragon destroyed the thorne
Would have rather them due a series on Sothoryros or Ulthos….
I'm sorry but nothing will beat GOT
After the fiasco of an ending to GoT, not hyped for this at all
Will only watch this if the two writers from the GOT series are banned from coming within 100 yards of the new stuff.
Game of thrones in Hindi dubbed
Hope this new series will wash the sins of the last season !
So. This has a couple of Red Flags.  The first and most obvious. It comes from a failed show. Would anyone want to see Star Wars Prequels if the Original three were bad? It is close to the Sequels situation. The movies were SO BAD, that they killed the Time-line, no one cares and there is no merchandise.  Second: "Diversity quotas" it is so horribly hammered that it will probably create a backlash. Was it so hard ot keep Dark Skinned people in Dorne? Or Summer Islands? Or even NOT give them with hair and still call them Velaryons?  While the story of the Dance of Dragons is good. With today's Woke climate, it will probably be a disaster, and again given how GoT tried to "look progressive" they did it so wrong that it destroyed the three female leads. And given how controversial in-Universe Rhaenyra's story is. This is going to be a train wreck.  They are putting WAY to much into visual effects and that is usually a good hint of a weak story.  "Toxic crews" nowadays it is so common to blame fans instead of admititng that your work is bad, that they will probably kill their audience themselves instead of the show itself.
let's see how they f^$^&$^ this one up at the end as well - i'm still disgusted at the ending of GOT
na mal schauen ob das was wird, mein schmerz sitzt immer zu tief das ich es kaum in worte fassen kann. Wenn sie das verkacken, dann reicht es mir endgültig!
полюбасу жижа
Please don't put out trailers like a year before. The anticipation is killing everyone.
I wish I cared.
Kind of over it tbh but who am I kidding I'll probably still watch
Fool me once shame on you
This is gonna be epic can't wait to see 10 000 ships, flea bottom amd and the sea snake trailers
best be good or the legacy of game of thrones will be forever ruined by s8
2022? Goddammit just bring it out already!!! You owe us this HBO.
Like all of you the ending of the series really soured everything. But I still love the books and the show prior to that so I'm definitely going to give this a (cautious) shot.
ill just wait till its over to watch them all in one go one day ,after last time its not worth it use destroyed GOT 👎
Уууууууууууу ( . ) ( . )
The teaser was not even remotely as interesting as the comments below!
The Doctor is probably the only reason I'll give this a chance.
Matt Smith has traveled into the PAST. Who'd have thunk it possible?
Eh, we all know how it ends. One shitty season to ruin them all.
Tbh I wish they brought back Emilia, 'cause you know how people in the same family(esp this one since it's incestuous) can have the same appearance, she could've portrayed as Deanerys ancestors that look exactly like her.
"Gods, Kings, Fire, Blood!" This is the most twisted version of Captain Planet yet 😳
piece of advice; dont get too attached.
Please tell me Dan and Dave have nothing to do with this show.
Lot of people bitching about the end of Thrones, but it was solid enough.
Really? They rushed the last season of a successful show to ruins to now release a prequel? Hopefully got better writers on board.
Hope they know how to end this one properly…
Please don't ruin it like you did with Game of Thrones.
Got fans just came back from death💓😊
Nnnnno...I'm still mad at you!
Finalyyyy the targaryen
Note to self: Don't expect anything or risk disappointment.
Knowing how it all ends, do I really care what happens before?
lmao. of course woke HBO added a token black person.
Why are we not starting from the begining, from Aegon the conqueror and his dragons and all that. It pains my heart to even have to think justice will be done to this series.  And GRRM, will we ever get the final book? Only thing that ca put an end to the disaster created by D&D.
I'm ready to be hurt by bad writing again
HBO max release in india
low ass budget
Excuse me, am I correct, that it is House Velaryon is shown on 0:39 ???
Give me a good reason to watch this after what they've done in got season 8?
Dreams didn't make us kings..     Unfinished books did...
😮
I hope this show would has a similar atmosphere to game of thrones' first season through its run.
Wakanda forever!
Uh oh.
Oh look. Woke GoT. Black kangs with white hair riding dragons.  Because all those black fantasy enthusiasts might be offended if there aren't black kangs on dragons.
Dislike! Remake season 8 idiots!
I hope, the script has been written not by those two assholes, who wrote GoT.
Pass
I want to be excited, but they did the books dirty in the end with GoT. I can’t imagine this will be any better. I’ll hear how it went second hand, but thanks anyways.
Lookin' forward
The nerds in the comments are so dramatic. 20 years ago, Kevin Smith summed it up perfectly: “Militant movie buffs, sad pathetic little bastards living in their parents’ basement … (talking about) movies and actors they claim to despise, yet can’t stop discussing.”
Did anyone else think this was going to be a spoof when they clicked on it?
Do prequels ever really work? Has anyone forgiven them enough for fucking up the ending to the original series to bother with this?
Can’t wait for the unspeakable amount of incest the shows gonna throw at me
Can’t wait to see how this one pans out!!
Meh after the way u fucked GoT give this a pass,
Por favor quién, comentarios en español , que me muero de ancias 😔😔
omg ---->https://youtu.be/-jl4VP-XFgI
HBO you used to be a cash cow.But now….Your just a cow….😑
first ZS Justice League, now GOT Prequel.   *I believe in HBO supremacy*
Not even this deserves 4K from you? :(
Adorooooooo
Rinha de dragao lol ai eu gostei
You fucked up 10 years of waiting for the battle of GOT and destroyed that last season & you still got the audacity to make another sub series …
I just had a minor panic attack
Big fights didn't make GOT great, dialogues did.
I wonder how many episodes they’ll go before they ruin this one.
Matt Smith gonna carry this show. Especially if my hunch is correct since the Eleventh Hour as Dr Who he needs this to prove once again what a talent he is. I think this is gonna be good.
Another ridicule Blackwaching of  characters ... Not going to watch the show .Period
Oh good. A show about some cgi dragons fucking shit up. Good thing the idiot masses will eat that shit up.
Atleast it's not Dan and Dave making it so being optimistic is maybe not completely off the table...
To me, watching this, will be close to pointless, knowing how it ended.
Oh look. It's the dragon show again
Overall it looks nice i think
Won't be watching this shit after what you've done to Daenerys.

Did they really call this show Hot D? I suppose it's appropriate.
CAN. NOT. WAIT!
OMG
This looks awful my god
Just a moment ago, while watching the prequel GoT vids narrated by the cast, I thought how cool it would be to see a show about the events before GoT.
Unfortunately I am not gonna bother. Wasted my time with GoT and I am not doing so again. I have better shows to watch. Although Matt Smith does look good in this.
yeaah okay draw us in rip out hearts out ..again.. GOT , True Blood ..etc...
Velaryons cant be black. Period.  They fucked up this show and it hasnt started yet.
I'm going to go way out on a limb here and assume that just like every other prequel this is going to be bad
Just as a reminder:  -The book "Fire and Blood" from which this series will be adapted hasn't been finished yet by G.R.R Martin. -The Book series of "A Song of Ice and Fire" from which this the "Game of Throne" TV show has been adapted still hasn't been finished by G.R.R Martin. -Actually, none of the novels projects that G.R.R. Martin has started surrounding the world of Westeros (A Song of Ice and Fire, Fire & Blood, The Tales of Dunk and Egg) are actually finished and it's very unsure (due to the aging of the author and the fact that he's been actively slacking on all of these projects ever since GoT has been out) that we will ever see the end of any of these projects. -We all remember the disaster that was the 2 last seasons of GoT, the exact part when the showrunners of the series didn't have anymore written material to base their story on.  Just as a reminder...
damn gerald's family looks good here
Can’t wait! 🐉 🔥 ⚔️ 👑
Só vem House Of The Dragon, só vem 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Why buy into the hype and renew a subscription after that season 8 shitshow?
Ahhh... I see HBO is missing that sweet sweet dragon money. Considering the catastrophe that was Game of Thrones I think I will not be contributing.
Nice to see the throne look a little closer to what it is described as in the books.
I saw this in trending and thought this was a parody video cause why the fuck would doctor who be wearing a shitty white wig like that and looking constipated
HOTD-Hold the door (story of hodor)
no thank you, never got into GOT until season 4 and regret ever following it since the failure of the final season. will never be invested in any show like this again. i will be waiting for entire shows to be completed from here on out and even than be reading reviews and asking friends if any show is worth watching before i lend a second to see if it peeks my interest.
probably not watching it
I think it should be easier than GoT because here you have all the story to the end. Of cause, they must someone who will write sassy lines and clever comebacks. But at least it should be a lot easier to make a decent storyline...
Can’t wait to see how bad they fuck up Rhaenyra and Daemon 🤪
Yess
We missed a lot
Are those black Targaryens I see?
ok - time for fan theory channels to get to work!
We have all been waiting for it....
This didn't get me hype at all.
I'm so hyped!!! After season 8 and reading the prequel Fire & Blood I'm so excited for this!!!
Okay, looks pretty good ngl.
We want sequel to make things better, not prequel to remind us how it ends !
omg
Matt Smith is going to nail it here 🔥
House of the Woke Dragon. Brought to you by Twitter and Chinese government.
But I don't want HBO MAX
Me (initial thoughts): Heh, this actually looks kinda cool. Me (reminded of the end of GOT): Oh. Right…
Oh boy this will be epic.
Lets hope they don't fuck this one up
Knowing that danny will ruin it all..... not interested
Wait is this a parody or not, i actualy can't tell at this point?!
And knowing how the story ultimately ends, what's the incentive in knowing how it began?
Is GRRM ever going to finish the main books it’s been a decade since the last one came out we don’t need more history books and backstory respect your fans and finish the main story before doing all this extra shit
And then what? Get lazy and fuck up the last few episodes? Never again!
Black Targaryens? At what point would these actors have to stop and ask themselves: Do I look silly and tokenized?   No original content for non-white actors because the racist hypocrites in charge don’t believe they’re good enough to create original diverse media around them so what they do is treat them like purse puppies, inject them into white centered creations and celebrate.
plot twist for the last episode: you wasted your time following this show. They don't give a shit.
New Witcher looking great
Why would I watch this, when you completely ruined the whole thing with a disgustingly rushed ending?
Is this completely new story ?? Or continuity of any story??
Omggghh
To the people complaining about a few black actors. The three Strong boys are already believed to be bastards by having brown hair and brown eyes. They don’t have silver hair nor purple eyes in the books like Leanor and Rhaena. In the show, there will be three obvious traits instead of two.
D&D really killed GoT - it's a little sad
Hoping for 5 great seasons ,then 2 trash ones at the end.
No thank you.
The all-action trailer doesn't bode well... :( Holding out hope the "Trailer-making, Season 8 defending, fans will swallow anything, it cost a lot to make look impressive so therefore the story doesn't matter" people aren't the ones making the show.
I wanna watch this, do I have to watch game of thrones before so I can understand it or can I just leave it out?
Как я рад что жива сейчас и смогу это посмотреть!!!
With how the last season of GoT was concluded, I'm still not healed. such a shame. not gonna watch anything to do with GoT, not even youtube videos.
Hi ! Just stopped by to say there is no way in hell i'm watching this (trailer stopped at 2 sec :)) ) after season 8 of GOT . The North remembers ;) (or mid-eastern Eu in this case)
crying
Why the fuck would ANYONE try GoT content from HBO again after that last utter catastrophy? Fuck out of here with this
Who else want Danearys in House of Dragons ?
Please dubb in hindi also
Please release in hindi also
Are they going to fuck it up like they did with GOT   don't think I would pay money to watch it
In all Song of Ice and Fire was only one black from Summer Isles, everybody laughed on him and considered as clown. Just fact
GOT fans: I can't wait to be disappointed again.
Omg can't wait 🥰  Side note: is that the Dr?
So you could not live with your own failure
I think we all know the way this is going to go. I'll give it 3 episodes to win me over.
Why are everyone complaining about season 8 ? Life is not only happy endings and we must be thankful that TV show like this even exists.
It was the stag that ended the dragon 🤣  Targeryens are overrated.  Without their wittle dragons, they ain't shit
So long as dumb and dumber aren't involved in making this series, I have hope.
Hindi dubbing 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
HBO ruined GOT
There is no night king.....White walkers then it is just like eating  food without hands😂😂😂useless
FINALLY
So Season 7 + 8 opted to completely explain all mythology as boring, semi-scientific crap, then the story exploded in a crescendo of bad writing, bad acting, bad pacing, bad dialogue and a bad, boring ending. You ruined the franchise. There is no going back, because we know all the backgrounds and they are now officially boring.
Damn, Doctor Who, has gotten to comfortable in this reality.
Apparently I’m not the only one still angry about Dany lol
#trending 1
Knowing the ending of GOT, you can go 2000 years back and I still will not watch it. That last few seasons were a big fucking slap to the fans.
No matter how bad GoT ended but still it's one of the best series for me and I will always love it's part...
Got’s last season was trash… I’m sorry but I’m not going to waste more time your plots…
so youre gonna mess it up in the last season again? why not remake the last season of GOT, there is still so much to finish
Plese Tamil Dub Hours of the dragons
Not gonna lie, I have no interest anymore after what happened with the last seasons.. fuck them
ONE REQUEST FROM ALL INDIAN   MILLIONS FANS   Please dubbed in hindi
I would trade this for remake of S8 GOT
0:39 LOL ---- they HAD to do it..... 3, maybe 4 Black Targaryens + a mixed race? 5? MOre we can't see, undoubtedly.   Please tell me they work a VERY creative explanation of why and how a family of platinum Blonde whites that married cousin/brother/sister/uncle, have Black people wearing the Targaryen Sigel. If there are great Black actors that fit a role well, than great... no one cares about that; and kudos to great actors of all races playing the roll they were fit toi play!   But nothing is worse than throwing in diversity hires into a show, for the mere sake of it... to thwart the inevitable race obsessed social justice moths from counting the people of color & counting the number of words they speak per episode, then making twitter hash tags of it.   Black people are not the most important thing on earth, and if a movie doesn't need Black characters, they need to learn to drop the entitled BS and live with it.
'An HBO original series' Sigh.
Can't wait to see which actors they get to play Blood and Cheese!
Lets hope that this show will be like the good old days of game of thrones
As long as Dipshit and Dumber are not directing, this will be good.
#RedoSeason8
Damn this is gonna suck too huh
I really need this to help me with my GOT hangover.
Milking that cash cow. We still haven't forgotten how you ruined GoT...
I hope they do not fuck this up like season 8
Looks like it's time to renew my HBO subscription 👍
NO MORE David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, they sucks.
No, this time I'm not going to invest my 7-8 years so, in the end, you can disappoint us. 😌
After Season 08, who cares? If I watch this, it will almost certainly be through pirating. I won't give these jokers my money until George finishes the damn books and we can get a REAL adaptation.
Once bitten, twice shy..
I want dracareys and dragon
Comiendo ansias desde el 2019
We waiting for that 🙏🏻🤍 When start ?
Aliexpress Targarians
Matt Smith was the wrong choice for this show.
Vikings is better.
Does no one here understand that David & Dan, the two guys who bastardized the original story aren't a part of this production? It's reasonable to assume it'll be different this time, so I'd be willing to give it a go
the doctor
Yaaaasss!!!! Finaly SESSION 8 REEEMAKEEEE!!!
Still haven't fixed lighting I see. Dark af trailer. I have no hope from them.
I won't ever think about it .. I just won't... HBO drops trailer... Me- I just want
Summer islander Targaryens? Rather diversity Targaryens...
let's hope it doesn't have a Season 8
When are you coming to India in tamil language....
you hope hatred might someday replace the pain, but it never goes away remove random crits
Looks boring
Meeh
👍
I don’t know, I’m scare to trust again. Also, when are we getting a new season of RAISED BY WOLVES?
D&D are not involved in this, so I can watch it 😆
just because d&d aren’t working on this doesn’t mean these people won’t screw it up, a lot of the writers in this series worked on GoT with d&d and held the same belief, don’t fool yourselves to think otherwise
Yeah, I'm not doing this again. Maybe years down the line, when it's over and done, if the reviews are stellar, I'll give it a shot. The first one was a massive disappointment, my heart is still broken.
Remake the last season of got
A prequel for an unfinished story.
Prince Philip is now a king.
I wanted to watch this, then I remembered the dumpster fire that was GoT Season 8.  Hard pass!
I honestly thought this was a parody for a doctor who event or something lol
A
I didn't notice the tardis. It might be in invisible mode.
All the dislikes are likely Biden voters.
We want daenerys targaryen Back  We want emilia clarke Back NOT all this Bullshit
It looks diverse. If that is a requirement.
Abhi maza ayega na bhidu....😌🔥
Wow, you can thank season 8 for our lack of interest.  A prequel to a train wreck; no thanks.  I'll save my money on the other 99% of oversaturating content in media.
The fire and blood
Ramin Djawadi again...right?? Please say it is.
I am one of those few who actually was ok with that ending 😂 now lets see how this prequel will end
I just want to see Rhaegar in Action and how they actually took the throne, of course without burning the whole city. 😅
You know what I can't be arsed with this
Season 8 was trash... I can't even get excited about this.. even though apparently black people were finally deemed worthy to be included in this fiction...🙄🙄
Eye Love it ! Motto of the Dragon Army ; Nobody Is Born a Dragon, You Become ONE through Blood, Sweat, Tears and lots of fkn pushups.
After fucking up the last season so completely I promise I'll not pay a dime to this company. I'll pirate it like any lover of the lore. House seaworth till the end of time.
These actors look stupid
Spolier alert; Robert Baratheon becomes king.
I can’t wait to see who is playing mushroom.
Looks interesting, but the thought of how this all ends (season 8) still haunts me.
doctor who?
We need this about as much as we needed those horrible Hobbit movies.
💯💪🏻
No.
Rhaenyra, rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms! ❤
ok this is the doctor's craziest trip
Doesn’t look very good.
The prequels should have been made first before the sequels
Finally i cant wait!!!!
CGI BUDGET  📈📈📈📈
Лучше бы Игру Престолов растянули до 12-13 сезонов вместо этого. Показали плавный и логичный переход к тому что вы показали в 8. Угробили шикарный сериал, стараясь побыстрее его закончить.
Funny I didn’t know this was released and today I was watching video how public reacted when Arya killed the Night King thinking to myself: that’s how we gonna feel when this crazy pandemic is over…than Boom I see the teaser released & took me back to all the GOT watch parties and theories… for that I’ll watch & please don’t screw this up HBO we had enough trauma from the final season of GOT
These "Targaryens" look average at best what happened to their superhuman good looks? And is it really too much to ask in 2021 for them to CGI their eyes purple??
How will you fuck it up this time?
It's hard to make an engaging prequel when you know where it leads and it isn't satisfying. With GOT season 8 the mythological and mystical side of the story is ruined  which is unfortunate cause'  that was what separated the story from a dry medieval political drama. Without the mystical,magical side I don't see it working like its predecessor.
succession
¡YO QUIERO QUE REVIVAN A LA JOVEN MADRE DE DRAGONES!
DREAMS DIDN'T MAKE YOU KINGS"""""  GEORGE RR MARTIN DID
Nope, not interested, and you can place the blame squarely on Dan and Dan. (Seriously, though, you should sue them for breach of contract and tortious impairment of goodwill)
House of the Dragon sounds like a sequel to a Bruce Lee film rather than a GOT prequel.
looks shit
and yet the last two books are still not out
I'd check it out but I've been burned before. I'll wait until it's been canceled and see how the reviews treat the ending. I'd hate to waste years of my life.
No dark episodes this time, please
Me orine
this is a hard "meh" for me
More delay for winds of winter.
#RestoreTheSnyderverse #releasetheaffleckcut , #bringbackbatfleck , #batfleck , #releasethebatfleckfilm , #DeathstrokeHBOMax, #HenryCavillSuperman ,#MakeTheBatfleckMovie ,
never forget they had a blank check from HBO and still managed to ruin what could have been the best television show of all time.
Kinda wish they had decided to just start from the Conquest proper, and potentially build to this time period.
GoT's reputation is pretty dead right now
i will wait to watch this till 2 years after it ends. just in case HBO lets another disaster happen and kills the entire show again.
I will watch it after it ends assuming they dont s**t the bed again.
remember people, it may have been D&D that killed the last season (or two) of GoT, but HBO is the producer and had final say in things. HBO let us all down too.
They will fuck it up when they reach to the end just like GOT
WHY DOES THE TARGARYEN SIGIL'S DRAGON STILL HAS FOUR LEGS?!
Daenerys: The Age of Dragons was before me, I'm still its mother and queen of them.
The last season’s of Thrones were so bad I won’t waste my time watching this!
❤️‍🔥🥺❤️‍🔥🥺❤️‍🔥
So lame
Please dubbed in Hindi
This will be a DUD
Hope it doesn’t end like season 8 did.
This looks ok.  But I dont really care about the Targaryens.  Always been my least favorite house.
The Doctor has gone far
So this was where Prince Philip came from.
After all these years the pain never really left, this only reopened old wounds.
Lets see if this will end better than GOT
Daaaamn we need this in time of pandemic
forgive me if i approach this with a dragon sized amount of caution
It's Prince Phillip / Dr who! YESSS
I'd like to check this out, unfortunately, the last GOT left me with PTSD (Post Television Series Disappointment)
Finally something good in this day.
I can’t wait
c'est très explicite la bête 😜
Why anyone would trust HBO with this confuses me. Especially since they botched the hell out of GOT.
" Dreams didn't make us king, Dragons did "  Bran the broken : Hold me wheelchair
I’m about to lose my shit  😭
Scrap the series....use that movie to redo the final 2 episodes off Game of Thrones.
Plz also dubbed in hindi language
And then Arya comes out of thin air and kills the dragons in a one dagger move.
Sorry HBO, but I haven’t forgotten that disastrous GoT ending. So I won’t be watching this one
00:38 this is supposed to be a fantasy so anything goes, but this feels like the forced diversity that is trending in Hollywood films and television. They put Blacks and Indians in Catherine the Great; I am mixed race, but I'm getting sick of this fucking shit.
Fuck this. lol
Just gonna end up ending it as a trash fire.
im pumped to watch every season except the last <3
should be called "desepered actors soon to be forgotten"
They had the chance to make the throne like in the books.
i am very scared to get emotionally involved in anything GoT after that horrid last season but fuckkkkk this looks so good!!!
So is this gonna be during the Conquest, Dance of Dragons, or Blackfyre Rebellions, or all of them? I haven't really kept up with any news regarding this after what D&D did with GOT.
ah baby yeah hurt me one more time
No mamaaaaames 😜 😎🥰😍😱😱😱
😱
Please tell me dumb and dumber aren’t involved in this prequel…
good luck with that HBO, you'll never get the old rating from before season 8. Don't try to fix it with something new, delete season 8 and try again. This time try to make some sense. What will the night watch, watch?? Why will the unsullied go to a place certain to kill them? Why did grey worm have any say? Why was Bran even considered to be king with so many before him? Why did you ruin the arch for Jon Snow, making him look like a fkn coward when faced by what he had been looking for all that time? Where the hell did the flying lizard go and why doesn't he recognize his rightful master which should be riding him? Please remember your writing classes, aye?
So youre saying for the past 200 years these fucks never made any progress in technology?
Oooooooo farrrk yeah boi
DOCTOR what are you doing ?
I really hope it`s gone be good and hyped us again for the books :D
0:52 was a perfect moment to add Mortal Kombat’s theme.
Trailer views aren't necessarily a projection of success. The Ghostbusters reboot was one of the most reviewed trailers of all time, and it was savaged. And while it wasn't an amazing movie, it was decidedly better than s8 of GoT.
Yeah... Sorry. Watching this trailer feeling utterly underwhelmed just confirmed for me that the last few seasons of the series were so increasingly poor, I just don't really care anymore. 😬 Feel bad for the ppl who I'm sure have put a lot of effort in, but don't think that bell can be unrung for me.
*WONDERFUL!!!! - But it is SO WORSE than this one* kkk youtube.com/watch?v=b5fp-QugEcY05
Ok, estou pronto para me decepcionar novamente
House of the Kardashians
Omggg 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Lol Black people  everywhere in every show yet no Indians lol
Please just plan an end cycle that makes sense.
Potential but I don’t want them to long put the prequels just do one season per prequel pls 😂
since season 7 and 8 i no longer want to look into the GOT direction the wound is still raw of how much of a FK up they made
Weren't they going to make a show about the Long Night? I guess after they shanked the Night King, nothing about the Whitewalker would seem interesting or relevant.
I don't quite understand why the other history of Game of Thrones show was cancelled...wasn't it going to cover Robert's rebellion as well as history of westeros? I guess they want to do this first.
Now I'll relay this little bit Happens more than I'd like to admit Late at night, she knocks on my door Drunk again and looking to score Now I know I should say no but It's kind of hard when she's ready to go I may be dumb but I'm not a dweeb I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem
This is terrible
At first impressions, the thumbnail makes this look like a parody
I’m never gonna see this after what you have done with the last season of GOT… You destroyed the best series ever…
The way they ended GOT I can't see how this would be appropriate
George Martin claimed that this time there will be 17 dragons but the makers did not show a single glimpse of any dragon.
The music is breathtakingly stunning
You better make it up to us with this!
Nope 👎. Fool me once but never again. I’ve learned my lesson in loving a series too much.
I just internal screamed finnnnnnallllly😭
Can HBO Fix GOT? I think so. If they make another series but this time with good quality animation and being more faithful to the books, I think it would, because then we would discard the SERIE (the last two seasons mainly) or not, and we would be more faithful to the animation and then yes a sequel with House Of The Dragons - which also title would be more appropriate if it were DANCIN OF THE DRAGONS, where actually is the beginning. Here's the tip. !!!!
Hopefully the dialogue will be just as good if not better than the early season of GoT...hopefully
Well this one has books to back it, so there shouldn't be any excuses for a fuck up ending like season 8 of GOT.
So excited for Seasons 1-4 of this.
enfia no cu estragaram a porra da serie Daenerys merecia mais
Yes please the music sounds awesome!
toxic, what you have done. toxic you are.
And not a Douche and Douche in sight. Thank Rhelor.
I want to be excited for this, but after the GOT season finale I am scared
The most pointless story in history. I'll not be back for seconds
I couldn't give less of a shit about GOT but Matt Smith got me hyped
We wiz dragon riders n sheeeeeiiiit
Here take my money And don't u ever stop making such incredible showa
Most of us clicked on this for Matt smith, no point in denying
After how HBO did me dirty w got season 6-8... This a pass for me dawg... Especially now that HBO is owned by Disney , who were part of the downfall of got
The black "Targarians" look like Stargate SG1 characters, so cringe.
00:35 OMG PRINCE PHILLIP IS THAT U?
Plot twist: shiity final.
please stop
It's probably going to suck.
So many comments about books
I hope this time that story doesn' t have a shitty ending, like the recent one (Daenerys story)
You better redeem yourselves!!!
oh yes. politically correct african targaryen
Sure hope this doesn't have the same writers as GoT.
Is this a story about the targaryens?
Ohhhhhhhhhh shit its coming back  Oh and Matt Smith, excellent choice!
i'm crying!!! WHY AM I CRYING! Can't wait!
Hard pass
Just covering the entirety of "Fire and Blood" nabs you 3-4 seasons. Covering up to "Dunk & Egg" nabs another 1-2. "Dunk & Egg" alone gets you a season and a half. After that, I'm concerned.
ΤΑRGARYEN COMING BACK...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #GOT
who is writing it this time? is it the 2 D&D idiots? If so, I won't bother, as soon as they ran out of books, they fucked it up.
If the writers that ruined the GOT finale season are involved I'm out. I can't bear the disappointment lol
I just can't watch it, season 8 killed it for me.
Trenzalore is in Westeros!
I just can't bring myself to return to this franchise after what they did in the last season. They murdered every story arc and not in a good red wedding sort of way.
would have loved it even more had they done justice to final season of game of thrones
🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩
We all know the ending.......    ......It's Bran narating the stories, cause nobody else knows. Just like he knows Dany will go crazy and die by the hands of Jon and surprise, him being king.
Oh boy, can't wait for all my expectations to be subverted and left with an immense feeling of disappointment.
Looking forward to lots of people getting burned alive 👍
Helpful Reminder: This is a story based on a FULLY WRITTEN history by GRRM, unlike “Game of Thrones.” Do not compare it to GoT.
omg omg omg😭
Just like Kings Landing with dragonfire, I've been burned before.  Can't get excited for this.
Woke
Dumb question but I'm in the UK and cant get HBO max, will we still be able to watch it from launch day?
Will start good then be a big shitty let down last season 😂
IN LOVEEEE
I’ll start it when GRRM finishes his books. Which means I’ll never start the show.
Doctor Who em muitos planetas realidades e submundos diferentes mesmo
sorry but no. you failed GoT, this is probably just gonna turn to shit as well
bitter taste from season 8 still here...
Hey if it gets a good ending I will be satisfied
I can't say I'm excited for this after that shit show they called season 8 but I will definetly watch it
to this day i havent rewatched GOT, the ending episodes spoiled the greatness that precided. you fucked up.
Can't wait to torrent this.
Reshoot GOT S7-8. Fuck this show
Well this looks.................................
200 years before season 8. Welcome to the House of Crap.
Naw fuck this remake the ending of GoT
200 years before the throne fell  More like 2 years after they fucked up the biggest TV series Of all time
Boy, did the Doctor screw up this time with the Tardis!
"I don't want it."
I hope they ll back valarmorgulis in it. He is immortal or like a jedi at least.
Remember everyone, HBO is not the reason GOT fell from glory. It was D&D.
Lets hope this hits you more in the feels like the first seasons of Game of Thrones, not like the last seasons of Game of Whatever.
Season 8 sucked, never forget
No one asked for black valyrians... Stick to the source material. If you wanted to have black characters why not create a character who's originally from Sothorios, an island continent with black people who have their own culture and customs.   I'm black and I'm sick of this generic and forced diversity.
Fuck anything GOT im out ,that was such a poor execution at the end i cant spend more time in another and just be disappointed at the end fuck off
Oh for fuck sake just go away! The way you guys ass raped "Game of thrones", you are like Disney doing Star Wars ... Just stop!
Congratulations on 1 Million sub ❤💥
Low-key crazy how little an impact this show left in the world considering how popular it was. It just ended and no one cared anymore.
Trash
As long as D & D are kept well away from it.
OH MY GODDDD WHATT TWHATTT THE
Is this based on a true story?
I can't believe that this is really happening!
Oh my god, I was going to completely ignore it after the total disappointmed you did to us all with GoT's last seasons, but since Dumb & Dumber aren't involved in this, and THERE'S A FUCKING DOCTOR IN IT I will have to give it a try. Matt Smith as a Targaryen, what an idea.
good thing they ruined the last season of GOT so they could focus on this!!
What?!! The 11th -and arguably best- Dr Who was a member of House Targaryen?!?  🤯 Mind. Blown. 🤯
Wooooo
With the same shitty ending?
oh, this is an adaptation of Dance of the Dragons? Interesting... it *looks* like Matt Smith will be the lead, but it'd be odd to have Daemon Targaryen as the lead character: arguably Rhaenyra and Aegon are the leads.
Who gives a crap about this ? Everything comes down to G.O.T ending. when you know the ending, why bother ? are they going to explain more on white walkers ? Never gave a shit about the fucken house politics and was interested about the nightking...10 years of waiting and all i get is stab in the chest by an annoying hacked flying bs arya. thanks not gonna waste my time
Yo HBO, you can't just forget about the wet fart of an ending we had with GoT. You better find some three eyed raven way to undo that shit stain of a mess in HotD.
If those two spastics are in anyway involved im not going near it
I swear Matt Smith was born to be a blonde
*Will definitely be watching HotD. No show has ever provided the same buzz during the opening credits in anticipation of what was to come like GoT did. People questioning the production costs based on this first official trailer – HotD was never going to have the same budget as the latter seasons of GoT!; clowns questioning the logic in portraying a story that's already been told – Yeah, the popularity of Shakespeare's work truly nosedived after the 17th century; fools grumbling as if the show owes them something & that viewing it will deprive them of their precious time alive on planet Earth; The “World”,“We”, Nobody” wants to see this... blah, blah, blah – Nothing worse than the self-appointed spokespersons' talking garbage supposedly on behalf of the masses! I take the point regarding the decision to cast a black actor to take on the role of Corlys Velaryon in breaking the lore but this on its own shouldn't detract from a well told story. If it's the same costume, set, props designers & location crew, then it's guaranteed to look spectacular and hopefully Ramin Djawadi will provide another great score.*
Well whatever you do, don't watch the last season.
Shouldn't ruined session 8 of got 👎
I think my heart just pooped it’s pants 🥰
Me: "I am not going to watch any spin-off of GoT. They ruined it." Aso me after watching the trailer " HOLY SHIT, the iron throne looks AMAZING. Ugh, I'm going to end up watching this..."
I see they didn't spare the woke bs by having bIack Targaryens. I wouldn't care if it wasn't deliberately put in for that reason. If HBO put it in the "Sopranos" movie, they'll put it in House of the Dragon.
Well this is simple... If it has nothing to do with Martin and everything to do with DnD, it's not going to be good.
How much of the content will follow the material written by GRRM? I don't trust them to go 'off book' like the last time.
White Hair dyes gona stock out soon...
Like the extra spikes by the Iron Throne. Don't like the ugly chick playing Rhaenyra.
As a dragon, I feel marginalized. I made you King and you cant even show me in my own story…F**hajhfireofdh you
Is it a joke? I watched it because I thought it would be a parody
I'd love to watch this but wow I actually don't feel excited about game of thrones anymore. definitely a one time watch with how it ended.
You will fuck this session too, at the end ...not interested anymore...Watching barboslar the sword of Mediterranean
Feels strange- I should be excited but GoT ended on such a sour note.....
The house of incest
Does anyone care about this
When in 2022 I need to set a reminder....cmon
Right......cause that final season really left everyone wanting more stabs in the back.
I'll be watching just because of Matt Smith.
😍😍😍we waiting
Okay, Iron Throne still isn't big enough, but it does look cooler
lol targariens were described as beutiful specimen, idk these actors are off.
Why's it so F**king dark!!!!!!!!!!!
Nah
Woke garbage, virtue signalling, you guys lost me.
"Balerion is coming"
Hard to get excited when I know the ending and how 💩 it was..🤦🏻‍♂️.
Fokking smokies everywhere, Velaryon's origin is from Valyria not form Nigeria.
im gonna vomit from velaryon's smokey face
Black Targarien? So tired of this political bullshit.
shitbox
I don’t know if it is worth watching. What they did with the last season really makes me think the hell with it.
They ruined tha last series so who should we spend
Thankyou HBO.....    Finally HBO realised.....After Game of Throne ... they didn't have enough arsenal to be in the competition......
OMFG
Wow. People actually can't stop bitching. If you don't want to watch it then don't watch it. Easy. You don't need to inform everyone that you are definitely absolutely never ever gonna watch it
The new minority presence feels forced
How will they make this woke?
They have a lot to make up for after the terrible ending of the first series. They better make the game of thrones series about the ghost guys from the matrix reloaded better.
I have a feeling this will flop. They should have done Robert's Rebellion instead.
oh my fucking God i am literally shaking i could not believe my eyes . its a gift its a gift
Remember guys,last episode of this series Will be so dark that we need extra brightness to watch it
Black Targaeryns? 🤨
they ruined the IP beyond repair
Hey guys I'm gay as fuck!
Killing it 😘❤️
No pasaron ni 10 segundos del tráiler y yo ya empecé a lagrimear de la emoción, recuerdos, nostalgia y tanta espera para esto.
We need to see a shitload of dragons
Темнокожие Таргариены. Извините, смотреть не могу
Prolly all the action in the whole series was in this trailer.
Clicked on this trailer to say. Don't bother investing your time in this they'll just mess up the ending and waste everyone's time. also create another spin off and leaving unanswered plot points hoping you'll watch the spin off for closure.
Let's hope they won't sckrew it like they did with the last seasons of GOT. It will be a shame!
Looks woke
y'all better not mess this one up too
Dumb and Dumber arent directing this one right?
Really saps the anticipation when you know how it ends. A house, destroyed.
So HBO gave us Chernobyl as an apology against GOT. Bigger question is What else do they have now if this one fails?
ayo is that the doctor
I’m looking forward to this but I’m also skeptical. I just don’t see how anything can compare to the greatness that was GOT. Especially if it’s literally only going to focus on one house…
It has been years and i'm still not over that GoT ending, but let's go through all of it again. I like being hurt :')
Damn.
Coooooool can’t wait
Please just make 3 or 4 seasons and don't make shit up, follow the books. Still cant get over GoT
It’s like when they started fear of the walking dead 💀 ☠️
I know the technological progress in medieval times was going at a crawling pace, but it's a bit discouraging to see literally nothing changed in 200 years from weaponry to fashion.
Winter was came & ends with a small dagger ...tragic end ..I don't like the end
I'm Asian, but I don't want to see Asian people in the "Game of Thrones" drama.  It would be really disappointing if black people or Asian suddenly came out as a person from the Targaryen family or the other big family.  It's so scary because there are Asians and white-haired black people in the trailer video.  I don't know why American dramas coming out these days put races that don't fit the story flow.
I know now the times of being extra tolerant, but why the lore has to suffer? Targarians being all light skinned and violet eyed now 80% are dark skinned. For what reason?
“An HBO” is grammatically incorrect
All aboard for the next gut wrenching betrayal at the hands of a train wreck of a show!
'an hbo original' makes me so angry to read
Pass, GOT is dead.
Please tell me this isn’t a D&D production
Please dont fuck this up, like the last season ☹️
I'm not racist, but black Targaryens!? Seriosly?! Valyrians also had very light skin and purple eyes.
That guy looks like vitalik buterin
HBO really thinks we would give them another chance after ruining a masterpiece? AHA....AHAHA..........BAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Get a frickin clue!
So strange that people are trying to dunk on this show purely because D and D fucked up the ending to its predecessor
Wow 😮   This looks like the cheapest shit that HBO has ever created 😅  HBO Headquarter: we have ruined the last season of GOT. What can we do as apologize? Let’s do the same shit again 🙃
Just when you think you're out, they pull you back in.
Spoiler Alert: The books are better
Them: I swear I've changed. Things are going to be different.......i promise. Look to prove it to you I redesigned the throne to look more book accurate.  My dumb ass: well I'm mean.....I you promise things will be different then maybe.......sure why not.
I don't see the point, knowing how it all ends.
Fuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkk bro fuck! Come on!
dafuq is this shit ?
I cant wait 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is actually very sad. Don't you realise that you have already destroyed this franchise? Let the old man publish his last novels. We don't care about your disappointing adaptations.
GOT is garbage
At least Benioff and Weiss are not involved
OMG!!!!! I'm so excited!!!
oh man oh man oh man! hype is on!!!!
So this the time of the house civil war? Lame!!! I want to see the conquering of Westeros by Aegon and the Black Dred...
Deaman Targenyan efsanedir.
Meh.
At least they have Ramin Djawadi's
Lost all the interest.. Booooooring
This is Matt Smith's best look and no one can change my mind.
Don’t want to waste my seven years again
Diversity quotas already making Velaryon black 🤦‍♂️
This gives me "i broke up with my ex so i could start dating her sister" vibes
Honestly I have doubts.
AHHH I CANT WAIT
its gonna be in 6 april obv (its also my birthday :D -imagine to watch game of thrones new season's first episode on your birthday hahaha)
Espectacular, solo espero q esta vez el final parezca final
"Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did." wow! That part! It makes me feel like...I don't know how to explain it. I'm really really happy to see dragons again.
Didnt know prince Philip was also a targaryen
considering the shit show of a finale for the original...no thank-you
Is this a series or a movie?
Just wish they made game of thrones longer with the same characters instead of making a new one 😭 it’s the characters of the game of thrones I loved
Maybe i am the only one, but, i am done with GOT. Still hate that end.
😳😍
I'm waiting👍
Can't wait to see it, this period of history is the mot intense in got pure fire.
Whatever
They will fuck this one up too!!
finally a story worth to  waste a time
Milk it for every penny !   Money, the story of bread and circuses... and some dragons too.
The fact that Matt Smith might have found a more perfect character for him than The Doctor scares me.
Fucking sick man 🔥🔥❤
D&D are just scapegoats, understand this people! Truth is every company will do whatever they want, as long as it makes a profit, fans will always be 2nd place. And then they act like it never happened, like they always have your back. Never forget how they treated us, that's who they still are, that's who they will always be, like all greedy companies out there.
Do NOT go PC and woke on this HBO. I’m counting on you to do this properly like the first few seasons of GoT. Don’t ruin it.
1. More Jellystone please 2. Give us trailers for 8-Bit Christmas and that Steve Urkel Christmas Special NOW!
Good luck and don’t fuck it up.
Not a single dragon spitting fire but... awesome!
No thanks.
I'd rather have seen GoT finished properly than seen this show at all.
Naa I'm good I know how it ends... I'll just play Elden Ring.
Matt Smith. I'm watching this.
trash
😴😴😴😴
Matt smith. Nice. One of the better Doctors.
All the Targaryens and Velarions look pretty basic to me... I guess looks-wise Daenerys really was playing on a league of her own. And when you think about the fact that they actively made Emilia Clarke avoid the sun to keep her skin pale for the role only to go for tanned Velarions in this one... starting on a shaky note already for me. Lucky I have zero expectations after that abomination of a last season.
😳 the hi
HOLY SH*****T!!
Daenerys could be the first queen to sit the iron throne but they killed her. Nobody liked it. And now they decided that their first story to adapt will be the Dance with Dragons. You know that one time when the older daughter of the king was the superior candidate to the throne and a bunch of sexist lords and knights didn't like it and just killed her... Am I the only one who sees a trend here?
Oh i still remember what littlefinger said "not thousand only a hundred" it shock me a bit seeing the iron throne like that can't wait for this🙂
Doctor?
Didn't show a single dragon
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 my life has changed
Though I am dying to watch a series about Robert Baratheon's rebellion I sincerly hope this would be good.
The mad king !!
Doctor WHO used his TARDIS to come to a parallel Universe.
BOYCOTTS THIS SERIES!!!!
virtue signaling holy shit.... im so tired of this pandering. where is the asians or latinos ?? stop baby black people
What do you wanna bet theyre gonna shove leftist politics down our throats?
We are team Starks 🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺 . Got was all about the Starks 🐺. So not watching this bye.
In before those hacks who killed GoT ruin this one as well.
No thanks. GoT was a huge waste of time, I have zero interest in this IP now. Howabout you pos finish the Spawn show from the 90s?
I thought Lorne Balfe will be the composer when I heard the music, because of the similarity of Assassin's Creed.
Wow Targaryens...... But does it matter now after wat Jon Snow became...🤷‍♂️...
So not going to watch!! GOT started with the startks🐺. They are the ones who carried the soul and essence of the show! We want Stark stories not this stupid stuff. #starksforever 🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺 #thenorthremembers
I hope they don't duck this one
ഒരു ഡ്രാഗൺ 🐉 കുഞ്ഞിനെയെങ്കിലും കാണിക്കാമായിരുന്നു... 😭😢
Looking forward to this because of Matt Smith, love him as an actor.
Does anyone care for this crap anymore? After s08, fuck this. And to booth, the freaking books will never be finished either...
Waste of time. It will start great and slowly turn to a rushed bit of garbage in the end.
Is it filmed by the book or did d&d created another masterpiece?
I AIN'T WATCHING THIS SHIT UNTILL IT ENDS
am i the only one who feels like this is gonna suck ?
A black guy cast as a Valeryon?  This series promises to be as bad a shitshow as the GoT final season.
Hopefully less incest and sex and more Dragons and Action
So we got a trailer for GOT early than LOTR. Annoying…
Wont watch because of the blackwashing
Hindi main ayega ke nahi
Makes me think of Drogon still being out there
Looks like the cosplay version of GOT
LETS GOOOO
But can they write a show now?
Nope. Sorry HBO. Don't trust you to do this show. You had absolute magic in your hands and you let D&D absolutely kill it.
Do you remember Game of Thrones ?! Do you remember how did you fook it up half of it ?! Do you ?! I do.
We wuz valyrian
👍👍👍
I saw the doctor and I clicked easy
Spoiler alert; it ends with GoT S8 as its finale.   No prequel will ever be interesting or worth the time when you KNOW where it ends up anyway. Absolutely nothing of value will be gained by this.
Velarions are blond, light-skinned with an exemplary Valyrian appearance.  Fighters for equality who lack their own mental capabilities due to frequent brain injuries: TANNED VELARIONS
Matt Smith,  Doctor 🥴🤤
This is just pathetic. Game of Thrones lost its importance the moment it ended, and now this just seems like a weak attempt to return it to relevance. But then, consider the fact that the collective IQ of GoT fans is below room temperature, it seems like they're succeeding.
Why would I want to watch this when I know where it ends up?
Fuck yess im so hyped
Please show Rhaegar Targaryen I'm rooting for him.
Still i was confused who built that big wall ? Is that wall built by the fist of first men  to save themselves from White  walkers ??
11m views in 5 days..  This means the fans were correct and D&D are trash.
hopefully next trailer we can see actual dragons :/
Fool me once…
If those two idiots are involved I want nothing to do with it
im ready, let me have it
o cu ta como
House of the Dragons? Bitch please... More like House of the Incest.😆
Black Targaryen? Are you serios?! F*cking tolerancy and sjw...
Tamil dubbed please
I'm sorry,  I can't take this seriously. The 11th Doctor on the Iron Throne is basically fan art, lol.
better not be like season 8
Stark ?
It'd be cool if house Velaryon was more book accurate...
Who are the writers?
Please be good. Be what Season 8 should have been.
tomara que não seja igual GOT, começou super bem, e acabou aquela desgraça...
Black-skinned Targarienn with white hair hahahahaahah :DDD BLM's stupidity and insincerity of the Witcher comes across to GoT. Bravo HBO! Nothing worse to expect.
Wow so low budget that you can inky afford the word dragon not even one animation of dragon... The house was full of wild dragons
I like that they tried with the iron throne, but doesn't that mean canonically at some point during the HBO ASOIAF universe that the throne got down graded to what we see in GOT?
No thanks
Where fuukin' book George? 😒
Is the ending going to be the same as GOT. Anyone who've read the books please reply because I don't want to waste my time.
Looks like the doctor is on a new mission to redeem GoT
I'm not watching it if its ending is the same as GOT. I think they did not knew where to take the story of GOT so they made a bullshit in the end!
Sure. Will choose in 2022
This is basically a dish you like but gave you food poisoning and still we are going to eat it.. 😂😂😂
Откуда среди таргарян половина негры, а половина белые если они все кровосмешением занимались постоянно и заводили детей только от своих? Ну бред же полный со своей повесточкой устроили...
So this is a mash up series between How to train your Dragon and Game of Thrones.  Cool
I swear it gave me goosebumps. I think I'm ready to break my heart once again. Seems kinda worth it.
I will never trust game of thrones again after season 7 and 8. The way they ruined the best tv series ever. Its a big NO from me
Wow, they even made cutscenes for Ramin Djawadi's soundtracks. So much dedication!
Why are people complaining and comparing this to the first series? D&D are not around and this is based on a finished book. One has nothing to do with the other, give it a rest already geez. People can be so damn stupid.
Can we see young blind  meister at wall ?
Let's just hope its better than s8
This looks....SO boring.
DUDE!!!! So fucking hype for this
عجلو بالله عليكم
Not even a single charming character
बहुत उम्मीदें हैं।
Redeemed by putting prince phillip in here
HINDI VERSION......... 🤷🏻‍♂️
Burned once. Not going to be burned again.
"Fire, blood, kAngGs and diversity" 0:38
I love the clash of steel
I think the music is also taken from Game of Thrones
https://youtu.be/HjIYBbJfNPg
I hope you don't mess it up like the final Season of GoT.
“Dreams didn’t make us Kings, Dragon did” Goosebumps🥶
Who are those blond blacks?
nah ty im not gonna watch 10 season to get the ending of GOT in the woke era ;D
all we need for now is a official  trailer
" i've been waiting for to long "
Round 2, let's not fuck this one up aswell
Let's make extra great series and fuck it up in the last season  Please HBO don't do it again make it great and keep it great
Looking forward to see Rhaenys Targaryen as the Queen that she never was!
I hope this one is good. I don't want to get betrayed by bad endings again.
Hope they don't FUCK IT UP.
IT IS A HARD NO FOR ME......FIX Season 8 ....................... Tyrion Lannister is the true King
So technically the eleventh doctor is going to fix the GoT timeline, nice
Why is one of the members so insanely tanned too, this isn't love Island mate
They gon mess up the ending on this  one too, mark my words
Only winter ❄️ is coming...🔥 🐲
This looks insanely bad. Worst casting in the last few years.
Though it was the Witcher for a second
I can't wait💥💥💥
Officially GOT 2.0 is coming 🙌
Chocolate Targaryens is coming
The Look of this White Hair Targereon is just fabulous 🌺
Dragons did🔥🔥🔥
Meh
Nope. Never again.
They didn't become kings because they had dragons it was because tHeY hAd ThE bEsT sToRy.
Waiting For Prequel 😍😍
I'll pass
Look at my name
Passs... not watching their trash again
meh
How there are no ASIANS in a tv show called HOUSE OF THE DRAGONS is beyond me. I don't CARE if its a stereotype.
😎😎😎
Make in Hindi Dubbed Plasee @HBO Max
Pls pls pls do not ruin this!
Entemone pever 🔥
But it all leads to what happened in the original show so I don't care.
Never realized how much Matt Smith sounds like Ramsay Bolton until now
The only issue with the last series, as fans all know, was that it lacked a culturaly diverse cast. Glad to see this show has rectified this, guranteed to be good now
The ending of Game of Thrones forever ruined the franchise for me. This doesn’t excite me anymore.
뭔데.. 진짜 나오네?? 결말 뭐같았지만 그래도 봐야지..
Who Cares? whats the point when it all leads to absolute garbage. No levity in the past when the future of the story is worthless.
Not enough blacks and gays. Not watching.
I'm not an expert on the story pre-game of thrones so will someone more knowledgeable inform me. Will we see Balerion in action or is he dead already?
Is the this the time era before the Robert Bareatheons Rebellion ? If it is then it will be cool as they are finnally going to show how it all started the dragons ,how the Targereyans Rose to power. That will be Darn cool
A trailer for a show called “House of the DRAGONS”. Not a single dragon to be seen.  I get the feeling that’s going to be indicative of the show proper.
Can’t stop watching..!
Amazing
you must be off the plan if you think we have forgiven you for the shitshow GOT turned into
not over the end if GoT. I'll give this one a miss thanks
I don't know how I missed this by 4 days
nah im good
Lol, Dumb, No. There can be no hype for the objectively greatest disappointment in media history. The hype is gone, H-bo. Don't do this.  Still believe in my boy George R. though... #read
I’m not watching the trailer, not watching the show. just here to say the exec who said y’all didn’t up fuck up the last season, and destroy the value of the IP is delusional and should probably be fired along with anyone else responsible for season 8. Fucking tragic.
When he says “I’ll change I promise”
It sounds like ramsey is speaking
I would have rather them make a movie out of it and leave it there 🤣
Damn, somewhere down the line the targaryans really let themselves go havent they. we wuz kangz n shiet
WTF there’s black Targeryans and no Latinos Targeryans? Cancel HBO for not being inclusive enough.
I can't wait for this series 🤭🤭🤭🤭
That’s what I’m talking about ❤️ MonarchTRK
Honestly a dunk and egg story is what the world needs
legend come back
ohh man Im hyped now
What's the point ? The ending will make it a waste of time!
"Dreams didn't make us Kings."   Daenys the Dreamer: Uhh....
Let's make these dragons Great Again!
Matt Smith? I'm there 100%
I thought this was cancelled
Нормальный такой чернявый актер, с серебряными дредами. Смешно, спасибо :) Говнище смотреть не буду.
People that think this will be bad because GoT ended up in shits are dumb GoT turned out bad because ASOIAF isn't finished but most of these backstories are already done so they can use the books every details
From "little finger" to "middle finger".
OK! I already watched this twenty times! This is gonna be asm! :D Actually maybe it willb e as hig quality as the original show
Was expecting to see black Targaryens
another dissapointment like the last 2 seasons of game of thrones? NO THANKS!
Who was that stupid to make velaryons black?-1
No
Game of thrones is the best music ever played
given the betrayal we received in final season ...I am not eating anything you serve me
My fellow book reader: Velaryons from the hood can't hurt your hopes for adequate adaptation, they don't exist Velaryons from the hood:
well at least we know the story was written by George, not 2 idiots making up shit.
lily and barney stinson for yet another good show🔥🔥🔥
Is that Robb Stark narrating??
I wish this doesn't have a disappointing end!
i still havent even seen game of thrones cause i dont know where to legally watch it in my country
https://youtu.be/FAd4Dia8Cg0
Hopefully, they didn't let dumb and dumber touch the script.
Game of thrones 2.0?
Dragons must like white and blond hair color.
Love it!! But HBO?? WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO WAIT YEARSSS... i dont get it men
Hell no
may i call it blackwashing?
Am I the only one who feels like , you've eaten too much of a good dish , now it's served with extra ingredients and you just go "Nah! I'm good" ? 🤔 Either that or season 8 really left a bad taste
Lol after that last season i cancelled my subscription, not making that mistake again.
Poor Matt Smith. Terminator Genysis, Cut from Star Wars 9.. now this?? Guy needs to fire his agent.
Not excited at all, they fucked it up big time in finale.
Ready already to be disappointed
Geronimo!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCR488Zn5eUgBrQ4VFRhNuKg
Wouldn't it be better if you instead produced a remake of got season 8?
Wait until you see balerion the dredd .......
Omg love yall so much, thank you!
Is this drama related to house of wives??
At least it looks better than the Wheel of Time adaptation.
Man, fuck Game of Thrones and fuck HBO for bringing it back. Will never get over that last season :-(
Coming in hindi
folks it's gonna be  the biggest new epic fail in the end
If they ever do a Ser Duncan the tall prequal they should have Tyson Fury to play Ser Duncan
Op
Fair play putting Matt Smith in the thumbnail just so I'd go "Is that MATT SMITH?!?!" and click.  I'm sure he'll be great, that man can deliver the hell out of a monologue
A black Targaryen? ...
Hope you don't fk this like you did with the new sopranos
kinda tainted series after that awful ending ....but i guess worth a try
Just wow! Goosebumps every time i see it.
hope it is not like the tragic end of s8 ....
Commenting for future generations
No thanks. I'm tired of these Jon Snow dragon spitting fire and ice shit.
Please just don't kill a strong character pathetically this time. And choose someone really deserving to be the ruler......
Please make it Iconic like Game of thrones.
I can't get over the fact that they have white hair and black eyebrows. Like how does that work? People don't have different hair colors in different parts of their bodies.
I have no hopes
I think the story revolves around house targaryan
I need my mother of dragons 😍
Wonder if the two swordsman fighting are Cregan Stark and Aemon Targaryen, the Dragonknight?!! The 2 best swordsmen of their day
COMMENCE BEATING OF THE DEAD HORSE
I’ve waited for this 😭
Meh
কে সময় টিভির প্রতিবেদন দেখে আসছেন 😜
Dude looks like the night king
So the Doctor f**kedthe timelines again.
Can't wait to illegally download this.
Ohh my god It's going to be so much better when you know there's Matt Smith 😇
I'm very excited 😊😊
Oh cool. Another series that GRRM hasn't finished.
Fantastic
i can already see all the 14 year old girls bleaching their hair because they are "bloodfan"
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like it how no one is talking against why House Velaryon is black or even talking about why House Velaryon is Black. It shows how none here has even seen the book this book is based on let alone read it. A race of people came to westeros with Silver hair and purple eyes and apparently, their race has black people too. A race that reluctantly agrees on someone being of Targaryen blood if he or she misses common Targaryen features, has now black people. Nvm, not like i m gonna watch the series anyway so you guys have fun.
One thing Always on my Mind.. Who is Night King? 🥲🥲🥲
Why would I watch a prequel to something that ended so disappointing?  And pay  for it. This is laughable.
My favorite house is back. HOUSE TARGARYEN! DRACARYS!
Y'all came for that Emilia Clarke lookalike vibe. _I_ came for Matt Smith.  Nevertheless, no amount of Original Series flavour, is going to make us forget that you destroyed the ending of Game Of Thrones. For shame. Shame. 🔔SHAME!🔔 SHAME!🔔
I'm ready to love again...
Gods. Kings. Fire. Blood = game of thrones....
Isn't it kinda problematic they made House Velaryon black? I mean, House Velaryon is full of servants, sexual seed slaves to House Targaryen...  The Doctor: "I love BBC."
It’s like being set up with said ex’s little sister who you can see from pictures looks exactly like her but no one can get a good grasp of her personality, some people are saying you should go for it because she’s only all your ex’s good parts but others are saying you’ll just get betrayed again because they’re the same underneath and you have no idea whether you should take the chance to get those happy memories back or whether you can’t stomach another betrayal like that again.
I thought the tagarians are supposed to be gorgeous.....
that’s it??? Babe give me drama give me action I didn’t wait years after that disappointing mid season for this
HBO wants to say... https://youtu.be/15HTd4Um1m4?t=12
I can’t freaking wait 😊❤️ I’m soooo excited!
Time to move on to something else.
Aaaaaa can’t wait
🔥🔥🔥🔥 waiting
Lol, they could have just put all the effort into making a decent season 8. Wasted a fucking decade on GOT I'm not gonna even start another one. Fuck all that.
No Dwarf No Show
NO, THANK YOU. EARTH IS CLOSED.
Enough of this poor man's LOTR why don't you get us a sequel to The Sopranos instead 🙄
I loved Game of Thrones, and I'll fucking love this. I can't wait man..GOD DAMN IT'S BEEN TOO LONG. Every bad thing that went wrong with the later seasons of Game of Thrones had to do with Dan and Dave and neither of them are involved with this.
We need this serious in tamil language
Kinda wanted a series about the First Men instead but DAYM THAT TARG ARMOR AND THE MORE INTENSE THRONE!!!!
Please dubbed in hindi 🥺🥺 please
Without George RR Martin to fall back on, this is also going to be shit pretty sure
I guarantee woke garbage.  It is mandatory these days.   There can be no other thought.
Hoping they won't screw this up like they did in GOT final season
🔥🔥🔥🩸🩸🩸 made it
Please dubbed in hindi
So am I going to get invested only to be disappointed again?
You fucked us over with the main show, you get 0 chances of redemption. Not interested.
It's not a modern day series without black and asian people
Waiting⏳⏳⏳🌪🌪🌪
Fuck George R R Martin and anything that has to do with him and this series until he finishes the fucking story. Prequel better have a whole goddamn Starbucks in it for continuity.
HBO     plz official hindi dubbed Games of thrones and House of dragon
Got PTSD from the debacle of the final season of Game Of Thrones don't think I can trust HBO again
Fuck it, after GoT ending I'm not watching anything related again. 🖕🏼
I will watch this series only after it completes 9 season
medievel alabama with dragons, lets see if this one turns out as garbage as the last one
I mean, if you had the budget for a prequel, maybe you could have fixed the ending of the original show....Just sayin'.
Why make House Velaryon black though? It totally contradicts the Valyrian identity.
I am so excited
I actually take issue with the last line, the tagline "Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did." If it wasn't for a female Targaryen (called Daenys) having a prophetic dream about the Doom of Valyrian, the Targaryens wouldn't have survived the Doom, been one of the last Valyrian families standing (with dragons to boot), and then made their way to Dragonstone and Westeros.
What if they all go woke?
Just don't make it some woke diarrhea and I'll watch.  If you bring it in, i'm out.
Are you ready to have your expectations SUBVERTED?!
TAKE…..MY…..MONEY   (just don’t D&D anywhere near it)
Happy Taiwan National Day 🇮🇳🇹🇼 #TaiwanNationalDay
I’m freaking not over the ending of season 8 yet! I’m not watching this stupid show. *lowkey gonna watch the show with excitement*
I hope they don't screw this up like the last two GOT seasons, because it looks really good.
0:42 - Arya's Daga ... i can't wait
nah
Idk the name of the character he is playing I am just going to refer to him as matt smith and no one can stop me
As long as D&D is out or Dumb and Dumber, GoT will be great.
🤔
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
"I ride dragons now. Dragons are cool"-11th Doctor
Meh
GOT ending was shit 😭
Is this the apology for King Bran?
Looks awful.
This shit will suck
So, somewhere within 200 years— one of the kings ruling from the Iron throne was like... "damn all these swords sticking strait up snagging my robes!!!! I almost impaled myself last Tuesday on accident when my hand accidentally bumped me..... Can we just get them out of my throne room please??? They're just too much of a hazard."
MATT AT IT AGAIN
😍✅😍
"Choose Your Hous--- erm, Plan. Starting at $9.99 month"
How many of you are excited to see adult ser barristan semley ,young jaime lannister,ser arthur dyane whose scene was only limited in the first series.
Is that the Doctor?
I'm Waiting to see Dragons In New Season
I would have preferred Aegon the Conqueror storyline  This looks cheap
LETS GO BRANDON!
I'm just here for Matt Smith 🙌
I have a feeling it will suck. This has Hollywood story telling all over it. Maybe it's just the trailer but I can feel it in my bones.
IS THAT MATT SMITH!!!?????
please no more inclusion of black actors where they don't fit.
Looks cheap production already
Not another g.o.t please
Omg😳
you have already f***** over one Game of Thrones series now you're going to do another
Just keep Dumb and Dumber away and it will be alright..
Wake me up when they’ve started bombing the last season of this
Whats up with all these dudes with white hair
Yess
0:39 YASS BLACK king and Queen 🤛🏿👸🏿 Finally some decent representation of POC in this serie. TARGARYEN are not only white pale aryen
Trash, how about you fix season 8 then we might just watch this BS.
The theme of GoT has always been that power belongs to whoever is strong enough to take it and keep it....
nooooo way! they got leeroy off tikken 7?
Sure hope they don’t make the next greatest show ever made and then ruin the next greatest show ever made…
Let’s hope they don’t write Season 8 drunk
Ramin Djawadi doesn't get enough credit. He elevates scenes to the next level!
I'll admit that this does look pretty cool. But am I the only one just....turned off by the entire GoT universe now? I don't even hate it. I just have zero interest in it anymore
When I saw the thumbnail for this I literally thought it was for an SNL Skit......LOL
I like how they tried to make the Iron Throne a mountain of swords like in the books but gave up halfway through and is just the same prop with spikes on the sides
Who cares
No I will stick with the Witcher thank you very much.
I'm stil amazed from the fact that someone thought it's better to make this irrelevant spin-off that no one cares for ,instead of Boby B's rebellion
Expensive shit.
GoT ending still haunts me to this very day. What a tragic end to a great show.
Dear god, here we go again...i'm willing to be slightly frustrated for one more time
Very much Awaiting ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i don't know my a song of ice and fire history too well, the trailer said 200 years before the fall of the throne, is that dance of dragons era or king jeharies the conciliar
I'm just happy they at least did some work on the throne. not perfect but def closer to what its supposed to look like.
I bet this is going to be garbage just like Vikings and all those braindead shows end up being. Very cool!
Who are the writers ? And is this based on finished books or out of my ass guidelines like the last 3 or 4 seasons of GOT ????
Aj10i
Cautiously optimistic.
Book was amazing... lets hope this does the parts they use justice....ugh.
I could've sworn i saw Heimdall
YouTube recommends a lot of shit, but not this. Four days later!!
Are those black targaryens?. . . . Is this woke of thrones now?
I just want the damn book, between Martin, Rothfuss and Lynch this is hell.
wanna hear that djawadi’s main theme again🥸
Hey, maybe this can make us forget the god awful last few seasons of the original Game of Thrones.  Maybe our time invested into characters won't be wasted. Then again, I don't think anything was quite as bad as John Snow's story going literally nowhere with absolutely no payoff. Or how poorly developed and rushed Daeny's 'slip' into madness.
I'm no kneeler I still remember s8 never again.
I find myself watching these twice every day because is the only I have from this so far, release more!!!!
HBO: Hey let’s desecrate a truly engaging story further by destroying the lore and canon of the original work with our writing committee of monkeys and 2nd graders.
Absolutely not.
Sooo no time lords?
Очередной толерастический высер намечается в угоду повесточке)
Never forget the last two shitty seasons. Not gonna bother.
I never anticipate a series so much, this shit gonna be lit
I have high hopes for this!!!!! Super Pumped!!!!!!
Aha yeah right GoT, not doing that again.... is that Matt Smith!?
Dear Black Jehovah God Luciferian Jireh...JESUS CHRIST DID NOT MAKE YOU THE MOST HIGH GOD OF ALL CREATION...THE BLACK DRAGON-6666 DID!!! IMMORTALIZE ME-666 MANE!!!
The more you love the more you hate when that love is betrayed.
Lame
https://youtu.be/pG17ypWnqzo
Were that seriously black targaryans with silver blond hair?
Guys stop complaining about GoT. I’m personally happy just to see awesome dragons and epic battle scenes again 🍿
Can’t wait!!!!
Here we go again
I became a Game of Thrones fan later than everyone else. I never thought I would like TV shows like that but I enjoyed it because it reminds me of myself I love watching competitive things.   hopefully, I can get a girlfriend and watch it with her that’s my hope for the season!! 🙏🏾
please make this series properly.. and be better than GoT…
Welp can't wait to see the strong start then writers destroy the last few seasons.... again.
Fuck this, I was going to get HBO, but this trailer reminded me why I hate this trash
Looks low budget
This is the sort of thing I prefer to hear about from someone else rather that sit Tru an actual episode. My heart can't take anymore
Looks boring.....House Martell rules
oh shoot here we go again
nha man you didnt just put math smith is got ^-^
i can't wait 😍😍😍😍😍
I'm so damaged by season 8 all of this makes me sceptical lol
I read this book. I wonder if mushroom would be there and who will play that creepy character
These blacks are not Targaryens, they are differrent house with close relations to the Targaryens, shows that Targaryens were not racist to blacks🤣🤣
I could not even be less interested.
CRINGE!!!!!
Matt Smith first a Doctor now a Dragon king ;)
Fuckkkk I can’t wait for this. Hopefully the ending is better than GOT
My dragons....😔
Are you seriously gonna pretend the entire franchise wasn’t ruined with season 8 tho?
The pain from season 7 and 8 still linger - no thanks.
Who's the lady in 0:40  ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
The background music 0:53 dance of the dragon 🐲🐲 gives goosebumps 🔥🔥
lets all pray that they don't fuck it up this time
if this shit turn out to be good and becomes like a 10 season thing then i can say that iv been watching since the very beginning hahahah
The fact that the story line for this show is just going to lead up to the end of the Targaryen line
Can I expect to not be let down in the last season of this show? We'll see.
You better hire some good screenwriters this time!
This is going to be the highlight of my 17 years of life, idec about the crappy ending of season 8 GOT, so long as this slaps
I don't even care anymore
Please don’t suck
OMG https://youtu.be/1aEU1PsvqU0
Looks cheap AF.
Come on come on come onnnnn
A prequel to a storyline that has already been told, is not an "original story". GOT really boomed in the last few seasons. With the lack of talent in the film industry right now, this show is sure to be a load of garbage.  Keep focusing on making money, not quality. "Hollywood magic" had nothing to do with making money. How long do you think you can circle that drain?
They wouldn't be shit without dragons.
I already don't like it :/
Gerald of rivia could fit in this
OMGGGGG AAAA
I bet this one shits the bed too
You fu***d up the best show ever and now you want us to watch this crappy spinoff of it? No thanks!
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #FixWarnerBrothers
i would rather watch a s7-s8 remake
Will be so awesome 🤩
Palmeiras não tem mundial
DRAGONS ARE COMING !!!
not a very good trailer tbh... so wtf it about.. even GoT gone woke, white vs blacks and whits only win coz dragons i bet thats the theme
Neither Dreams nor dragons made us Kings. THREE-EYED RAVENS did.
Why is House Valaryon black? Doing this isn’t gonna get the idea across that Targaryens and Valaryons are the same people, both Valyerians just from different families. Valyerian is literally a race in GoT, so they all look the same. If they were gonna do this they should of made Targaryens black, now it’s just silly and doesn’t make sense
*OK... but when is Rome Season 3 coming out? :)*
Why does it sound like Richard Madden narrating?
Putain terrible elle va être cette série
Respect and Love!! HBO :) Eagerly waiting.....
Hope it would be as good as Game of thrones.
Prince Phillip Stormborn of the House Mountbatten-Targaryen, the First of his Name, duke of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the Men of Edinburgh, Lord of the UK and Protector of Whisky, Lord of Buckingham Palace, the Royally burnt, Breaker of Royal Chains and Father of Flagons!!!
Os livros tem conteúdo para umas 10 tempordas. Espero que seja melhor que GOT
you ruined GOT, i'll pass on this trash.
Oh please don't feck this up like the idiotas did the last time.
I feel bad for whoever has to remove all those swords
00:34 blonde wigs are cool
Absolute suckers
it's like, eh meh, who cares, we already saw what was really at stake.. and it was shit, this is just a cash cow
I love that they redesigned the iron throne to look more like its described in the books °.°
looks great but I hope that is not Blackfyre, it looks nothing like all of the concept art up till now.
Booooooooooooooo!!
Fire and blood is a gem of a story. This adaptation can't possibly fail. Looks fantastic 👌
*_"The Consoomers"_*
Wait what the doctor is a Witcher now? Seriously though, always glad to see Matt.
They will fuck it up at the end again
Im hyped, but all I want to see is arya exploring  the west
*_Black Valyrians? They're called Targaryens, not Targuntermensch_*
Please stop fucking ruining GRRM’s material
YAARRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Oh WOW! You added an unnecessary racial element to the story! Black Targaryens! How original stunning and brave! Like so many other content creators these days you've ruined a perfectly good thing by adding diversity. I hope you lose a ton of money on this.
If there are less than 4 dragons I’ll be disappointed
Im sure it will better than breaking bad .
HBO: "Witcher resurrected dark fantasy so lets hang on his popularity again, instead of releasing Rome Season 3"
Just came here to say, GOT final season SUCKS. thanks that's all
Where is TARDIS?🥺
Omg yassssss
try not to fuckup the ending this time
When you say dragons, I say look at my blue phone box and this little screwdriver.
Black Targaryens 😂😂 yeah right
Spoiler: The Doctor was raising a dragon army to fight off a Dalek invasion
doctor what in the name of sanity have you got on your head
IS THAT DOCTOR WHO?
This trailer failed to capture my attention whereas the original teaser for Game of Thrones from 10 years ago did a better job. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhqRmcsWqac
Just keep dumb and dumber away from this one.
Is this from the creator of dumd and dumber?
Am i the only one who thinks it’s not worth the time & attention, and still gonna watch anyway?
I'm a simple man. I see Matt Smith, I watch
Let's hope you are smart enough not to try and rinse your paying subscribers and RELEASE ENTIRE SEASONS AT ONCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GDMF's
Some of the characters seem half-assed.  As the new Khal Drogo compared to the real Khal Drogo (Aquaman now). Hope the actual characters will look cool.
those are danys ancestors,im crying
Maybe now that it's released, Martin will get himself to finish his book
Is this Doctor Who in the thumbnail? Whayyy
And now when they'll white walkers kicking ass we won't be able to enjoy it cause we know how badly it ends
Yasss Matt get it!
literal chills. this will make me feel better about danys death :)
Mark my words, they'll do a spinoff for each House until they milk this universe dry.
Wow ❤❤❤❤
🐉 🔥 👍
Hbo is trying to compete with lord of the rings show coming in september.
I will be supporting the blacks against the greens. Rhaenyra was the designated & rightful heir after all.
0:41 looks like an intense scene
We want 10 seasons for this one
Maybe a weaker version of game of thrones
Looks neat :3
Meh...
hopefully it doesnt take 17 season for the dragons to appear
Really? Doctor who? And what’s with the black dude? Are you so desperate to have ethnic roles that you literally throw in a random black dude amongst a bunch of ppl who are known for being whiter than sour cream
💖
This time they have materials and all written down on books…they better not screw this up!
I mean, I totally understand the reluctancy towards this, considering the absolute disaster that was GoT, but this looks hype as hell and the universe is still amazing. If HBO doesn't make the mistake of leaving the same incompetent writers at the table, then this could be a fantastic show, given that we all erase GoT from our brains and see this as a standalone production xD
Not watching if D&D is directing
Can't wait  for the end so I can see losers cry on 'how the show should have ended' 😂
So not being racist here but I thought it was weird that the men of African descent have blond hair. Are we to assume they are Targaryen? If so, those blond genes are strong, which makes me wonder why Jon Snow had black hair….
Dragon furries are screaming right now
Any one after 10 million views
Please hbo don't screw this up like you did the last season of GoT. 🥺
I'm not watching GoT lite. Y'all had a chance to adapt Aegon's conquest, instead we'll see another strong woman get killed and her throne taken by a man. Eff you lot. Bunch of suckers in these comments.
Finally the only part of the book series that I wanna see made on TV
They talk about dragons but where are the dragons? I watched this trailer for a Dragon! Then I get a stupid lance duel. Show me Balerion or Sunfire. Something!
Don’t you friggin disappoint us this time HBO
Can't wait to see the Starks.
Why? Again directors are going to change like what happened with GOT.  Sad to see GOT franchise fall like the Harry Potter series
Mantaps targaryn coook
is that Rob Stark narrating?
Oh wow. The clinically dead Game of Thrones is still receiving CPR?
대박 박박!! 왕겜 프리퀄 나오는건가요?!아싸ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
Idk why but this trailer feels like it is a parody or something
After GOT disappointing ending I will not see anything similar from HBO
Nice ❤❤
I'm crying guys...Amazing Days are on the way. 😊😊
HBO, you guys should definitely hire David and Dan to write and direct at least the final episodes for this!
Fu..k the Dragon  Hound 🥴
And what did you hear in the fire 🔥…
just let it die
Hope it's good, and they don't screw up the ending this time
Trop hâte !!! Les dragons sont de retour à westeros 👌👍
Please, don't let these bastards get any profit from story that they've ruined in last seasons of GOT
i'm so sick of the politically correct bullshit and all of our shows today. Targaryen's have albino light coloring with white hair and white skin. So now they are making black Targaryen's with white hair? Seriously? Just make other interesting characters who are black from other cultures. They've got a room and everything. I mean wouldn't it be awful if they made the black panther white? See what I'm saying? What's next? Transgender Targaryen's?
Dreams didn't make us kings , Dragons did .
Plz when the series will come. Hope it will come on Indian hindi dubbed version I hope so from HBO.🙏🙏🙏
Who else heard the dragon screeching 🔥 I literally got goosebumps ❤️
Teaser like same as KGF Chapter 2
After season 8 of GoT I hate the whole series and the books.
They need to redo the last season of GOT 😤 or just erase it from our minds lol
if the music is handled by ramin, i am still gonna love this as GOT
I am watching it with litteraly no hype ! Still disappointed about the fake last season of GOT ...
Hodor ! Hodor! Hodor!
Proof of how stupid TV producers think people are.
is the Targaryen black?????it's fucket up
No comments💬💬💬
#screencrush
So you want me to watch a show about the Targaryens but you bitch slapped Daenerys from her crown and freaking excited her character arc ( like all the others) how am I suppose to feel hbo HUH  # remake got season 8 A better to spend your money one
I’m definitely gonna watch it but I’m gonna be wary about it..
I won't mind if you give the throne to RAMIN DJAWADI.
Didnt that actor played in doctor who ?? Like decade ago
Aegon is a gwer
This will probably get deleted... but maybe it won't. I'm mixed race, criticizing the fact the valyrians are shown as black is not racist.  This argument is dishonest and lazy. I am all for diversity in shows, genuinely, if anything where is the east Asian people in the game of thrones universe? but *at least make it make sense.*  Show people from diverse locations. If you have to change the story to shoe horn in races it tells us one of two things, the people writing show, don't know, or don't care. Neither is good.  Consider for a moment that having black actors isn't simply done because the people at HBO are wonderful people, who just care so much about inclusivity. *It's a cynical corporate approach.* In case you haven't noticed there is millions of black people in America and mixed race people like me, they simply think they can widen the market and get more non-white viewers by shoe-horning in non white characters into roles that make no sense. If anything is racist it is cynical casting, assuming people  will watch the show more simply because of race.  It's lazy corporate bs, nothing more.  If they wanted more diversity all you have to do is have actual good writing. Showing people from diverse locations around the world of game of thrones, all different cultures and exotic locations. It's not diversity or smart writing if for example you just decide to get a bigger market share so you make a bunch of the Starks  have east Asian features so it will sell better in China, It would make no sense to the lore or world building. However we are doing the exact same thing here, but with people of African decent and everyone is afraid to even say anything for fear of being called racist, it is bizarre. Nobody was ever complaining that there wasn't more white people in Wakanda in Black panther, because that wouldn't make much sense would it?
Somebody really going to watch this after season 8?
NAH !ILL GO REWATCH DUMB AND DUMBER INSTEAD
Can’t wait for this one to start good and then have a shit ending too
THS SEEMS WORST THAN THE LAST ONE
find Dumb and Dumber to write the show again... what can go wrong emirite?
Wait until these suckers get the business en of a sonic screwdriver
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
Only reason I clicked on this is for matt smith. Game of thrones burned me too bad
If HBO can make a GOT movie after the TV series, you can ask out that girl.
i'll wait for people to give me the full review of season 1 before i jump into this
Now i'm confused... If they do want to milk this content, why did they try to cram 3 seasons worth of potential story into a single rushed and half-baked final season for the actual game of thrones?
This looks so bad and cuckex
Sounded like Ramsay's voice...
That's prince Philip from crown season 1. Awesome.
Oh look,more lousy writing!! No thank you!!
I’m waiting 😍😍
Pleaseee make in hindi 😭
Well well well better get ready for a similar Game of Thrones the worst ending ever : (   hope they learn the lesson The hero never dies
I feel like if I were to watch this show and it actually starts out good, the whole time I will have a restraint on my ability to enjoy it, just waiting for the moment of disappointment, where they ruin everything.
“Dreams didn’t make us kings, the Tardis did”
milking the dead cow
As much as I hated S8, it doesn't seem like Benioff and Weiss (Dumb and Dumbass) don't have much to do with this so I'm allowing myself a small amount of hype
Say HODOR while taking a deuce
Waiting 🔥
Please dubbed in hindi ❤️❤️
Please in India.....
In response to GoT season 8, I will not watch this. I'll wait until a few seasons are out so I can watch it in a single month during a free trial of the streaming service.
Hype hype
Stories? What about stories making you kings?
I hope they also do one about the North
Waiting
Lmao all the pure blood Targaryens had silver hair purple eyes and hmmm ummm pale skin ! Why portray the characters if you fail to get the description right
hold up, dragons aren't native of china?
Black Valyrians? Are you fucking kidding me?
allways prequels, why dont u do the sequel if u ended so poorly the last season and every fan end up wanting so much more from the show? a prequel is meh,  a sequel is MUST WATCH
one thing is certain - this will never live up to the hype
U ruined the whole game of thrones series. You can't fool me twice . 😂😂😂
ขนลุกกกก 🔥🔥🔥
YES OF COURSE, BLACKS LIVED IN THE NORTHERNOMOST PART OF THE WORLD, WHEN NONE OF THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BEEN TAKEN OUT OF AFRICA. BLACKS HATE COLD!
#GOT a part of my Life 🖤
if this is another season 8, ill personally red wedding the show myself
if D&D are involved then i will not be.
La verdad es que yo le tengo mucha fe a éste proyecto, tiene muy buenos actores, la producción será 11/10, tiene un libro completo en el cuál se basaron, es sobre la casa y dinastía más interesante de toda Canción de Hielo y Fuego, y NO están involucrados los guionistas de GoT :)
Waiting for colourful dragons to throw some 🔥
This is why they made the ending so bad to make it sequel proof. HBO stop squeezing every bit of money from this. Learn to end a series.
Am I the only one who is hearing the targaryen theme here??
Before there was House Mountbatten, there was House Targaryen
Mom can we get witcher or game of thrones?  Mom: We have witcher AND game of thrones at home  Witcher and game of thrones at home:
Ok where is gerald
Not this time HBO
Fast forward to 0:45, you’ll see a McDonald’s Large cup.
The entire fire and blood is brilliant and could be adapted for 10+ seasons
we don't wanna see what happened we wanna see what's gonna happen, we already know the past, what a waste of time and resources!
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Anyone else calling out the cultural appropriation?
Looks shit but was always gona be I guess.
As long as there’s more incest, I’ll be happy.
Looks wack
Hopefully you will not destroy this one as you did with Game of Thrones.
I’m not sure how I feel about this. It looks really good but... season 8.
Rhaenyra loses the war and is burnt alive but Aegon dies later as well.
Not again. Never again.
2022 - bit early to release anything trailer wise isn't it? Forgotten by then.
Now the shit begins....
This just makes me excited for the Wheel of Time series
I was very much fascinated when I watched game of thrones and I expect the same would be with this one.
Did I just see black Velaryons. They clearly missed the whole idea behind house Velaryon and dragonseeds.
They killed the essence of GOT and still trying to sell that same name!
0:39 - Sigil on the man to the left is that of House Velaryon. "House Velaryon is of Valyrian descent, and its members often have Valyrian features, such as silver hair, purple eyes, and pale skin." I guess GRRM never mentioned anything about how well they tan.
Let's waste another 10 years of over life.
Consoooooom
#Bringthemartincut
Game of thrones on univisium looking dope
🤍🤍🤍
Just here for fkng legend Barney Stinson 🤩🤩🤩🤩
In the end, the daleks come
Lol, enjoy what’s left of the fan base
Am hearing Ramsey's voice.
Негры c дредами и азиаты. В лучших традициях Netflix. Спасибо HBO
Waiting to see BALERION THE DREAD ❤️
So this is why Winds of Winter isn’t done yet…
Will Chris Pratt play King Vinerys though? My expectations are at the same level for a certain movie he will be voicing the protagonist for.
Foi o G.Martin que escreveu? Essa é a informação mais importante.
Everyone is fighting  for the throne they will cross any line without even thinking but  Bran : hold my crippled legs
Remake got
"An HBO"
I wanna cry TㅁT
We want in tamil
Can Emilia Clarke be in this show? 😩😩😩😂💔
Probably watch this as it's prequel didn’t bother finishing GOT stopped at like S6
HBO just promise us that you will do a flashback of the Doom of Valyria.  Please.  Please. Please.  You have the material, so use it right this time.
I'm ignoring this. Instead, they must have made " 'The' GoT Finale", like 'The' Suicide Squad. Even DC compensates for f***ing up.
Yea i never wanted to watch GoT when it was hyped. Then after 4 tries i struggled through season 1 and thought to myself, this was the best decision ever. The show was amazing. Then few years later, ive never felt that much betrayal from a show with that abomination of a final season. So this time around I choose to not struggle and not watch it
Am I the only one who's over GOT?
😀🤑🤗🤩
so hyped for this
Not excited for this but atleast its gonna be woke as fuck so nobody has to complain on twitter about exclusivity, maybe we will see some trans targaryen aswell.
Dragons did
I an extremely excited.😘😘
I'll give it a shot, but the last guys really left me with a bad impression of the world as a whole. Not sure I care anymore after their screwups.
Dreams did not make us dreams , dragons did  CAAAAN'T WAAAAAAIT
Finaly a good looking iron throne.
Dr Who in Westeros
yeah!
Those aren't Targaryen, they are Just people with white hair
PASS.
loving the butthurt replies in here. GoT character arcs ended exactly as they should. Of course, if you named your kid after one of the characters whose story didn't end the way you wanted or got a tattoo of same you'll be quite annoyed lol
NOT PRINCE PHILIP
YES
Let’s hope they don’t disappoint us again.
Brace yourself, CGI is coming.
There was no starbucks cup, 0/10
So cool! I can't wait
I wish they did a remake of season 8 of got and continued that storyline too. I think there are a lot of loose ends and story to cover
Love from India.. My all time favorite GOT
Why are there black people with white hair? There's no such thing as black Targaryen.
Well, I won't get my hopes up. It would be cool, though, if this turned out to be worth watching.
Bran : Armies didn't make me king. Bad writing did
I'm waiting for this
Just don't rush with this one because of new star wars or something and it should be fine👍
I have to manage expectations  after that 8th season 😭
I think I just shat my armor!
Love from india
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please stop with this
i would have been more hyped for a "Robert's Rebellion" Series or Movie
that Dragon armor is frigging coooooool 😤😤
Hope this is not sponsored by starbucks😅
8 still ruined this series
0:23 Weird choice putting the seven pointed star symbol at the pommel of Blackfyre
These wigs.........
<333
Is he the Doctor ?
Please don't do what you did to GoT
Hopefully HBO doesn't screw this one up.
Just hoping for a good story and not playing at politics from all theses recent shows
Wonder if they’ll ruin this one like they did the last.
Yawn....
Too much hype 😒
Is he the one in the thhumbnail who played the role of phillip mountbatten in the series"crown"
No thank you HBO!, we already know how everything gets fkd up in the end.
0:43 is that the sigil of House Tarly?
Please don’t be shit.
Finally something exciting again. Can't wait to feel the rush of watching new episodes of GOT again and see that hot actor onscreen after Crown.
Benioff and Weiss aren’t involved, right?
They better follow the book thoroughly... I want to see the start of fall of Valyria and then all the generations of Targaryens
LOL black Targaryens. Well done, brave&stunning. I guess you kind of forgot.
as much as i wanna be hyped, i just cant. just a minute of footage and its already obvious they chose to be woke as fck and it makes me assume they will make the same mistakes as D&D did for GoT..... i mean cmon black targaryens??? paying for hbo max? nah, pirates life until proven wrong
House Malfoy 😂
Rushed politically correct woke induced garbage, that's what it will be.
Ah yes. Targaryens with Fair skin, blonde platinum hair and purple eyes. Yes..
I'm a Christian. But I haven't forgiven HBO for the last 2 or 3 seasons of GAME OF THRONES.
This is what I've been waiting for since then.
The books,  I want the winds of winter. I'm still not over got. Just give me the books not another TV show. For God's sake will I ever get over this heartache?
Oh fuck...here we go again. 🔥
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PLEASE DOMT FUCK IT UP
No la vayas a cagar otra vez HBO...
❤️❤️❤️
I know everyone’s shitting on the casting of Matt Smith but tbh I think he’s gonna do a marvellous job
Looks like they are taking show away from its roots of politics, personal relationships and subtlety and leaning into special effects, style over substance, battles and dragons 🙄 always amazes me how people can crearte something wonderful but miss the point of their own creation. Oh well I’m sure this will be great fir selling t-shirts and getting people to watch the show in bars
Dissappointed when I saw the Velaryons...
🔥🔥
Hope it doesn’t turn out to be a democratic society ending 🤦🏻‍♂️ the trailer looks stunning though 🔥
Nope, you screwed up GOT, not giving you a dime for this, screw you HBO
0:18 That my friend, is Balerion the Dread .  .  .  .  .  Cuz I don't think they will just show any dragon out of the blue when people have watched 3 dragons in got
I’m so glad Ramin Djawadi will still be the composer
meanwhile... George r r martin has not finished writing the game of thrones.
So...most of them are black...of course
10M views in 4 days !
I’m just glad Miguel Sapochnik is involved in this, what an amazing director.
Dreams didn't make us king, dragons did Bran: hold my three-eyed ravens
I'll give this a chance but I'm still not over how bad it ended.
Why are there black Valerians ?
Finishing up House of The Dragon MOD WTW
melisandre looked about 250 years old, hopefully she shows up.  shes all im looking for stannis, uh you're way to early lady!
Those swords all around the throne and the stairs are a major OH&S issue.  It actually gave me anxiety thinking about tripping and landing on them.
Hits differently after they butchered the season finale of GOT
I think hotd would be much brutal and horrible than got. I am though excited to see Rhaenerya getting eaten by a dragon... Alicent weeping blood tears at the end of the dod... Baela having last laugh looking at Aegon 2 burnt body... At last I would be sad to see haelena and jaehera dying.
Hbo we want a series on young ned and robert. And Maester Aemon too….. And of course the Lion Tywin and the Bear Mormont…… We want a prequel to all the best old characters of GOT
So basically in a scale of 200 years, there’s been about 3-4 black people in that realm 😂
Don't forget to let Melisandre lingering around,too HBO. There must be another reason for her to get so excited as soon as Daenerys landed on Dragonstone.;)
LECIMYY DURR POLSKA
I hope they didn't ''kinda forget''' about Ramin Djawadi
It's nothing , I think that series is based on mad king and Robbert rebellion
lest we forget what they did to us with game of thrones
🔥🔥🔥
idk I feel bad to watch it
How many dragons are going to die in this series?? Out of all Game of thrones deaths, Viserion & Rhaegal hit the hardest. I already see it. I'm gonna become so in love with what the dragons will do & bam one of them dies & I'm going to regret my existence
Game of Thrones just took two weeks of my life that I dedicated to all eight seasons. I’m all good on any more mid evil shit for a bit
I'd rather see Matt Smith play a young Sheev Palpantine.
It's a shame I have zero hype for this. I'm looking forward to Dexter coming back more and I thought the last season of Dexter was bad too.
Yo is Matt Smith Daemon Targearyen the Rouge Prince? Pls I need to know
The fact that they keep trying to pidgeonhole black actors into clearly white roles shows how shit this is going to be. If they can't even be bothered to do such a small thing because of political correctness, how will they be asked to deal with the more minute details that make something worth experiencing...
Its so hard to think of a series that lost its popular cultural significance as badly as GoT did, so seeing this is giving me mixed feelings lol
Looks like The Doctor traveled to this universe. Strange i didnt see the tardis
The scene with hundreds of swords lying ...... Literally gave goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥🔥
0:50 now thats how the iron throne should look... hats off to the prop creators for that
meh
sorry but you can't literally destroy an ending to a franchise so badly then expect to come back into the fray like nothing happened.
Got next part🔥🔥
This looks Lame. I’m still pissed about how GOT ended and how dumb and dumber screwed it up.
I want to see how they built the Wall and what made them build it.
Hindi me Aaegi kya
Pls dubbed hindi #hindidubbed
Doesn't hit as hard as it used to, they ruined GOT at the end
Its so obvious that all you are trying to do is check one more inclusion criteria box. Inclusion in the original was natural.
Dreams doesn't make us King Dragons did anyone remember that voice? Young Ned Stark 🙂
FDamn I thought they were joking around when they said spin off
I am really excited this series ♥️🔥🔥 .. love from India
who want its comes aslo with hindi dubbed ?🥺🥺🥺🥺
Sorry Matt, you may have given me enough interest to watch this little teaser. But I guess HBO kinda forgot about Season 8.
Yeah, well.......no thanks.
Thanks for cramming random black and asian people in a stand-in for medieval Europe. Totally not weird, cringe, and distracting at all.
Dr.Who you drunk, go back to TARDIS and don't mess with dragons.
Please make tamil dubbing.
Black Targariens? Lol
The problem with this show and eventually any more potential spin-offs is that it just *_doesn't matter_* . Every single major event(s) that has ever happened in Westeros was all meant to lead to one single event. The Long Night 2.0. All this history is now all of the sudden kind of devoid of meaning considering humanity's action kind of did nothing to fuck themselves over like we thought it should once the White Walkers began their assault on the living. It just feels hollow. I don't doubt the series won't be a good adaptation, but since it's canonically in the same universe as the og show it makes it seem more of a waste of time than it should. Which is tragic in all honesty.
Game of thrones and everything involved it's completely ruined
Launch HBO Max in India!!
who's directing these?
Who else is looking forward to Starks (besides Dragons, of course) more than Targaryens?
Oh no, not action scenens with short shutter times again. 😥
Nothing they ever do will erase the sour memory of season 8, unless they reshot it, which is realistically impossible.
Whem you realise there won't be a character named Jon Snow or Tyrion Lannister in it.......
DONT RUIN THIS
Excited to see Balerion,The Dread😍😍😍
Hopefully D & D have nothing to do with it. Keep them far away.
I was read to drop this mess, but I'll rethink just for Matt Smith
A black Targarian? Are you sure?
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I wanna be excited but just can't find a reason
I’d be excited if they didn’t fuck up the last season of game of thrones the way they did. Even when I rewatch I still cant bring myself to watch that piece of shit last season.
The hype is real bruh
Waiting ...
https://youtube.com/shorts/sDQgUdIwX30?feature=share
IS THIS REAL?? OR JUST FAN MADE???
Any connection with GOT
This needs to dub in hindi
Afro-Targaryens?
Who else felt that music in the last....🔥💨
The background music of Game of Thrones was too good! Please let the music be as it was!
Dave n dan better not fuck this one up... Why waste time investing into it if we're just goin to get a repeat of GOT
Matt!!! 🤗
Try to get the ending right!
Just keep dumb and dumber out of it
I hope this last for 20 seasons  lol
Hopefully Dumb and Dumber aren't involved...
Waiting ♥️😌⚔️
LOTR series coming 2022  HOD also coming 2022 Someone has chosen death...
Black targaryrians? Lmaoooooooo
"Guess we kinda forgot about how badly Game of Thrones ended" - HBO
So many ppl talking smack already when we know we're all going to watch it. Let's not play these games of thrones. X) That iron throne tho...oof. I guess it's time to see what Kings Landing was really like when the white haired clan ruled...lol
It's the got music theme at the end for me😍 Shivers 🥶
Doctor Who is in this? Cool.
This is gonna SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
If that skinny dude is going to be aegon trash cast kicked him get Henry cavill
HBO max not available in india But its trending in utube 🤣
Need hindi dubbed
Will be a great hit in Alabama! 😉
l am daed l can't believe it !!! Finally it's coming 🖤 after waiting 3 years it's coming 🖤 😲😱🤯 🥳🥳🥳 !!!
Very little interest, I wanna know “what’s West of Westeros?”
"Dreams didn't make us kings, our sisters did"
“Reminds me of that tragedy.” - Norm Macdonald
Why start teasing a year befor!!!
Please dub hindi this sires please 🥺😨😣🥺
#hindidub
Are we gonna see Mushroom?  Anyway, I am so excited to see Rhaenyra and Laenor's Marriage.
I am so excited for this show. Because dragons were my favourite in GOT.
Super excited 😍
YOU SHOULD HAVE REMADE SEASON 8 FIRST! YOU OWE US ALL THE TIME WE INVESTED IN YOU.
Witcher in GoT
Please dubbed in Hindi
I've been waiting for this
Dark skin Valyrian house no exist and never existed 3000 years old history of Valyria.Velaryons always protected old Valyrian lows about marriage . @HBO still trying to fake ASOIAF history.I have no problems about their skin.I have a problem with fakeness of story.We need #ASOIAF Valyrian Houses never merried with other people because their genetic wasn’t as strong as others.  They protected their genetic with marriages. And Velaryons protected their genetic more that Targaryens too. How many times GRRM need to explain that?
The better resurrect the Khaleesi at the end of this. Her reign has just begun.
Just finished GOT today, fucking loved it. Kinda annoyed about dany on how she… well you know. I just wished there was more uhh. Cant wait for this
You guys still trying.  After that disaster of S08 you should have quit.
Yepp GoT....
It seems that HBO doesn't know how famous was GOT in india. I request you to release all teaser trailer related to GOT & HOD same day in hindi also.          Thank you 😊
eyvalllll
The last season of the original series totally killed any excitment for me for this. We used to have GoT watchparties, but ill doubt we will even be watching the first episode of this.
Can't wait to be disappointed for Season 9 of this new series...
The ending will be bran teleporting from future and saying "why do you think i came all this way?"
Выглядит круто!
No Winds? Don't care. You're all part of the problem for watching this btw.
Can't wait🔥
തികച്ചും iPhone📱ഇൽ ചെയ്ത Short Film   https://youtu.be/Mg7nOOVIjr8
"And fireproof doctors"
Don't give me hope
Waiting for Rhaegar supremacy 🔥🔥
Am crazy for this series hope they wont shit like last season of GOT
Looks like I'll be getting a subscription to HBO once again.
Bump 🔥
Rhaenyra is sooooooio ugly. I thought we would get a beautiful lady like Dany. She is not like in the animated cartoons.... What a pity... I prefer Olivia Cooke now.
*Game of Thrones* = Fantasy for people who hate fantasy.  *House of the Dragon* = Fantasy for people who love Bridgerton.
They made Targaryen's black ... another example of hollywoods racist blackwashing of characters, in this case those who were specifically described as very pale, to push their """diversity""" (which just means anti-white) BS. If this isn't another trash heap show, then I'm the queen of england. And considering it's following S8 of GoT which was almost unimaginably trash, that's a sure bet.
😌
Let`s make another awesome story and take a shit on all of it in the end like we did in GOT
Ok here we go again about to spend like 8 years of our lives into this One so The writers can fuck us over in The last season
Idk if I want to invest time into this and be disappointed like season 8 of GOT. Never was a Targaryen fan in the first place. I was all for house stark.
Hell yeah baby !!
“Gods, kings, fire, and blood. Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did.”.
No thanks. Not anymore.
Will you guys put more water bottles on set so bran isn't thirsty from all that wheeling around
It’s high time HBO stop this dragon shit now
Yes the last season of GOT was disappointing. But I cannot wait for this series. Come on...there's loads of dragons in it 😁🥳
If not one of the worst endings of a tv series ever this could have been a great prequel, but when you know how game of thrones ended its just lost all meaning
Fuck men goosebumps for real 🔥🔥🔥🔥❣️❣️❣️❣️
Omg ....PLZZ fast
…..Are we actually going to get more then 5 minutes of dragon scenes?
😔
I am very excited for this series  A song of ice and fire
Yea don't care. You dun fucked upp with GoT so I ain't getting invested again.
Here we go again. And we knew how it would end. Very very sad.
Meh
Personally it would be better to show us How targareans conquered westeros not how they ruled it but ok. Also how many ethnicities can they fit in an inbred family? Not judging I love seeing different people and ethnicities being represented but it is a bit odd to me that's all .
Yes but can we like.. simply act as if the last season never happened and trust them again just like that? 🥵
🤢 trash
https://youtube.com/channel/UCO0ufVPBd_c-lKGto1cw0OQ  https://youtube.com/channel/UCO0ufVPBd_c-lKGto1cw0OQ
https://youtube.com/channel/UCO0ufVPBd_c-lKGto1cw0OQ  https://youtube.com/channel/UCO0ufVPBd_c-lKGto1cw0OQ
Before i watch, is D&D involved in this?
Couldn't care less after the trash ending
As long as ding dong and dirk aren't involved
I definitely won’t be watching this
Rồng của tao đâuuuu
yeah.... I'm gonna watch the shit out of this
No Winds of Winter no deal. Hope people enjoy it but not gonna digest or buy any more George RR Martin related media until that book hits even though it never will.
I hope they make a show about Robert revolution,  it would be awesome
Spoiler alert… they all die
should be release in hindi dubbed also!!!
Totally here for Olivia Cooke. Can’t wait to watch this !
Already more effort than Season 8
No interest until I saw Matt Smith, now I have to watch it! Please be a Tardis, please be a Tardis...WITH DRAGONS!!!
Great Dr Who spinoff
My respect to anybody who can still give a damn about the TV-version of this universe. You certainly are a lot more forgiving than I am...
Hype 😍😍😍😍😍
seems weak
I don't care anymore, they really ruined it for me.
BrAn tHe BrOKeN=the creep
https://youtu.be/Je15rKfjSFk
Probably gonna find a way to ruin this too :/
Ugh... they gave the last GoT series a nasty ending... hope it doesn't repeat.
That vibe though 👀🔥
I swear the HBO Production team is out of this world!
magnifico!!!
Finally we will know what gave rise to the disastrous ending of GOT.
Hopefully they dont just give up in the last season again
Dreams didn't think of Coranavirus but humans activities did.
Expect a lot more incest
I haven’t watched game of thrones but I clicked on this because of Matt Smith
Heyy are you sure about that
Waaooo Got never gonna end will there b Jon Snow?😊😊😍😍
WE BACK LADIES AND LADS SHEEEEESH!!!!!!!!!!!
What black people? None of the characters are black they must be filler.
Let's hope Dan & Dave did not write this one!
Is this going to be about dance of dragons story or the Aegon conquest?
Matt Smith.
Not sure I see the point.
“Mommy, Mommy! There’s a Black in my imaginary tv fantasy show!!!”
There's a southern version called 'House of the Inbreds'
no thank you not again.
I'm here wondering how the hell are they going to make an intro better than Game of thrones. Unless they use the same op...
The nice thing about this coming out after GoT is that I have really low expectations... Still excited though.
Please don’t tell me Dumb and Dumber wrote this show!
People coming in here and writing a comment telling everyone how they don’t care about this show. That’s hilarious. We all know you’re gonna sit on your fat ass every Sunday night to watch the new episodes. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be here writing a comment.
so... they rush the ending .... to make a sequel
We want to see Robert baratheon fight wars and fuck girls!
Lol why did they add a bunch of swords around the throne? Where are your guards and advisors supposed to stand? This is gonna be worse than season eight calling it right here ppl, come back to this comment in a year an gimme a like when you see it for yourself.
Fuck everybody opinion I love the GOT ending. I would have been pissed at the ended any other way
I hoping to learn more about the children of the forest. They were interesting characters before they completely died out.
This should be called The House of incest 🤮😂
미챳다
Ahh yes another television show I won't watch for at least 10 years.
So, Prince Philip is a Targaryen?
I care about this about as much as D&D cared about Game of Thrones.
Finally some consensual incest representation on screen!!
Epic . . . Historical . . .
Not sure if this is a risk I'm willing to take after the final season of G O T
Why would HBO make this series? So they can fuck up again?
They need to stop with the game of thrones franchise. They ruined everything with season 8 let it go, I did years ago.
Y los dragones?😒🤦🤷🏽‍♂️
This looks good hopefully they don't rush it like they did with game of thrones
I hope you are secretly going to remake the last season of GoT along with this. 😅
'The extinction of the dragons will mark the end of this empire.' - The hand
Its not about Aegon's conquest ?  Feelsbadman
hopefully the show runners wont funk this up like they butchered game of thrones
I hope Gay of Thrones returns as an after show.
Where's my spinoff where Edmure becomes King of the 7 kingdoms
Casi lloro de la emoción !! Todavía no supero el final de GOT
Blonde-haired black dude... Fuck the dragons; now that's magical!
Is this HBO trying to make up for seasons 6 and 7 might want to watch it if the endof GOT wasn't so bad.
maaattttt smittth!!!
WOW
Waiting for the epic seen of night king 👑
remake everything since season 6
Making another GoT with the disappointment of the last season still ripe in our mind! SHAME!!!
damnnnnb
MAN I CANT WAIT FOR THIS SHOWS FINAL SEASON
Not going into invest in this rubbish ever again
you've all been invited to the red wedding ya ya ya ya
Now do Dunk & Egg.
"Oh my God a black character they ruined it" Nah, it makes sense. The Velaryons were one of the high 27 Valyrian dragon lords before they lost all their dragons. They were said to have mated with people from Sothoryos, which is described to have black people in it. Just enjoy the show, yall.
This will be as bad as the last 2 seasons of thrones name 1 good spin off ill wait.
Bran trying to navigate his wheelchair around all those swords.
Excited but skeptical? Hope it doesn't get ruined with politics.
The background music still holding strong.
*Still Won't Make Up For That Shitty GOT S08*
Idk....after the tv series GOT, I was heartbroken. I do hope it's good but I will probably find something else to watch until the reviews for this series are in. I heard they are also doing the Hedge Knight, as a tv series as well, it's not done yet, George still has to finish that one. Listening to Matt Smith in this I feel like the Eleventh Doctor has appeared in The House of The Dragon. I love him🥰
It took me a minute to figure it out but that white dude reminds me of Thanos henchman from the Avengers movies 🤣
Let’s hope this one doesn’t have an ending that sucks….
They will find a way to ruin this.
O fuck, Neeggaa? OMG u seriously?!)
I'm gonna watch this series with an IV drip of Saline water. So that my salt levels even out if this show craps on my psyche.
Dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did. Bran: Hold my story!
😍
I'm so excited, God let the dragons come😁
And then make sure you guys fuck it up to on the last season like you did for GOT
Gods, Kings, Fire and Retcon
Not too sure about this one ……………
this is useless because they kill daenerys in the end.
Oh yea oh yea.. its on.. people 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😇😇😇😇
We all know the dynasty is extinct so
Woaahh🔥🔥
With this entire woke movement, i think we're gonna have a Black Targaryen, I would watch the series just for that. PS: im not blond but come on, this shit will look funny if it ever happens
Food me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...
huh got sucks
The build up to Jon Snow was amazing only for his character not to mean anything LOL! Worse ending to any show ever. Please youtube stop recommending this. Not interested at all
Was that a black Targaryen? LOL
Probably the Doctor arrived with his T.A.R.D.IS in Westeros; but, honestly, what a crazy place to be!.
Who are waiting for wall , to see how it was made
I can't never be a king of anything....   Well that's suck
HBO is going to milk this series as long as possible lol
They cast some ugly ass actors for this. Jeeze
Yes please.
TODA VEZ QUE ALGUÉM REAGIR A ESTE COMENTÁRIO EU VOLTAREI E ASSISTIREI +3 VEZES 😇😇😇
I'm rooting for Ramin Djawadi's magnificent scores.
something something something TROGDOOOOOOOORRRRRR
I’ve literally gone week in the knees, I’m so fucking excited. If I don’t see a dragon in ep 1 I’m gonna vomit but oh my god I can’t wait
And it shows us….. absolutely jack shit
sigh... the way GOT ended... it kill all the joy i had in me. shame...shame....shame.....
Everyone is Blonde.
Can't wait to not watch this.
sure, I'd love to hang out with that ex that broke my heart that one time, i'm sure it'll be different this time.
Curious to find out woke angle HBO will ruin it with
Fool me once. Shame on you. ...
hopefully it’s not ruined the last season
this just reminded me im still angry about got botched ending
Why there are black actors??
re-make new ending first
I sure hope the show’s not written by Dumb & Dumber
boycotting the fuck outta this trash…the North remembers season 8
My meh isn't meh enough to describe how meh I feel about this.
Just can't get excited about it after GOT last season.
another series where john snow still knows nothing.
Yaas Matt smith
I just can't... D & D seriously ruined it for me.
Hopefully D&D are not involved and shit the bed again.
Something to take the pain away🤞🏼
*AMAZING!!!! - But it is SO WORSE than this one* kkk youtube.com/watch?v=TSvzBY7owUY&55
What's with the black Targaryen's?  Why they gotta do this shit to every show?  I'm black, but that doesn't mean I want to see black people represented in every single thing I watch.  Why can't they just stick to the source material ffs.
OMG!!!
Why would anyone watch this knowing that the end of it all is garbage
Yes yes yes YESSSS
WTF!!!!!!! OMFG!!!
Hope is avaliable on 4k
only iffff,,, they would had ended game of thrones at high note.
Would love to see a mini series spin off for Dunk and Egg. Read the book last year and enjoyed it! If you like GoT and haven't read this book set in the GoT universe, it's worth a look.
Pass.
the white man looks like vergil
Dreams didn't make us kings Dragons did Bran : i just asked daenerys why u didnt become queen u have dragons ... why i become king ?
The most overrated garbage show spinoff
I wish game of throne never be end...
Bran is Three Eyed Raven.. He can see the Past.. Also in season 8 of GOT, he tells Tyrion Lannister that he mostly dwell in past, so it's possible that ending would be envision by Bran
CAN'T WAIT!!!
Martin is a sadistic writer, to his characters and to his readers.
This time I'll do myself a favor and stop watching around season 3.
I have literally watched this like 20 times. Lol
Glad to see Matt Smith. Dude is my favorite Doctor.
Dreams didn't make us kings Dragons did Bran Stark become King.... and denerys with a dragon didnt become queen so that makes no sense telling Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did .............wrong story telling
Not gonna waste my time on this after GoT disaster
Yep, just as I predicted, I don't care at all about this
As long as the two dick heads have nothing to do with this, I have hopes. Keep them as far away as possible
polish the plot armor! get the deus ex machina ready!
Please be better than Game of Thrones.
more or less
The House of Pain ^^
I love Matt Smith way to play his characters. I discovered him in Pride Prejudice and Zombie, then he was the Queen Husband, so, I can't wait to see him in this prequel as King himself!
oh look, targaryens are black now too :S siiiiiigh and the propaganda and sjwness stupidity continues! next cinderella will be black too!
Why the fuck are they black
Weiner weiner weiner
If Benioff or Weiss are anywhere near this is going to be a disaster like the last 2 seasons of GoT. Don't let it happen...
Wow....blacks and asians fit perfectly in this universe....NOT!
we wuz in GOT and shet
Finally, a real Iron Throne
I dream or there is some black Targaryan ?
"HBO didn't make viral campaign marketing, Dragons did."
Matt Smithh !!!!!! Doctor Who
I have always been like this story, but I've never thought they would have some balls to film that because of tones of incest
Amazing!
Please don't f*ck this up
Let's go!
YEEEEESSSSSS
kkkkkkkkk se for para ter aquele final bosta nem irei perder meu precioso tempo, igual perdi escrevendo esse comentário e vendo esse trailer meia boca!
Not getting my hopes up
🐉🐲🔥❤
Oh good. Ill get myself ready for another series killing finale.
If they couldn't manage a decent ending for the main series, why should I bother watching a spinoff?
After how poorly season 7 and (especially) 8 were done, I don’t think anyone is very excited about this. I hope they have better writers than GoT and Westworld.
Meh they already fucked it up for me with that stupid ending
Never mind the casting, at least the throne looks more accurate eh 🙃
A series on dunk and egg or the blackfyre rebellions would be awesome
Sick of seeing Matt Smith in everything
The trailer looks great.  The only thing for me, and this is only an observation that I have no real problem with, is that the beauty of the actress playing Rhaenyra is not almost perfection as described for Tarargaryen women.  Although I could be mistaken about the description.
not falling for that again, wasted 10yrs on the last series for it to end up/ turn in to a turd
Ah I see those black Valyrians that totally were present in the show and lore and it's not a diveraity stunt finally showed up
I’ll give it a chance because of young prince Charles. He’s a good actor.
Hope these Targarans don't kinda forget about their enemies
This is a "I know she's bad and unfaithful... but she is so good in bed." moment of doubt for me.
This doesn't look as good. Hopefully it will be. Not much seen yet. Could be a colossal disappointment
I’ve never watched a single second of GOT (apart from this trailer?).  Is Matt Smith going to change my mind?  I doubt it.
Cant wait to spend years getting invested in this and then having the directors just shit all over the whole thing
0:41-0:43 if you keep pausing you can see the sigils of house stark house Lannister, and house bolton, and maybe a few more. it's crazy to think that these houses existed for hundreds (or longer) of years, but in the span of a couple years that Game of Thrones takes place in, many of them went extinct
I always was a fan of the Targaryens since i first heard the name in GoT. Thankfully it's 200 years back so i don't have to bother about the dumb ending of GoT. Now i can enjoy Targaryens in all their glory!
Spoiler alert, the dragons die
YES, DRAGONS!!!!
werent targaryans supposed to be inbred racist people? how come they have a mixed culture now?
Doctor?!? Is that you?? Holy shit, I almost didn't recognise Matt Smith.
Was that Matt Smith playing one of the Targaryens at 0:34?? He also seems to be the narrating voice for this trailer, so it looks like he's one of the main characters. Funny, I'm watching his season of DW atm. Awesome. I wonder what happened to the rest of those burnt swords decorating the aisles and the throne's plinth. Looks so badass.
finally casting people that look inbred for the role too I see
Corlys looks a wee bit tanned
YESSSS!!! Finally we could know more about the valyrian steel artifacts!!!!!
GOT v2
Whatever you do, don't put siege weapons in front of the line or make pitch black combat scene. Or we will hate you forever like GoT S8
Oh no another bad ending.
❤️❤️❤️
I will wait until the series is completed and then if it isn't F'd up like GoT. I will watch it, other wise, not going to waste 8 seasons of time just to watch the entire story plot be turned around into $h1t.
YES!! Can finally watch Nerd Soup again!!
Hooy, Matt Smith
So, the doctor got stranded here? Makes sense.
I want an aegons conquest series
Ah yes House Velaryon looks awesome here with their pale fair skin, ashen hair and purple eyes. Looks like a totally faithful adaptation of the source material. I have an idea beat amazon to it and do a tv series about african hobbits, it will be awesome.
Please don't tell me there are black targaeryans.....smh
After what was did to the "Game of Thrones" series, I doubt I'm going to watch this. Besides, what new is going to be told? The same world, the same creatures. And whatever happens, the end is already spoiled by two very talended guys. I'm not a fan of recycled products.
It must be an epic adaptation like the book, I can't wait
Just realized Matt Smiths voice sounds similar to Ramsay Bolton
Seems like a complete waste of time!  Even if the first bit is good you know they will just lose interest and let everyone down again.  Why would anyone even bother?   Maybe if they show it for free...idk.
Is that Ramsay's voice?
After the pathetic end of their last descendant in game of throne. Am really not looking forward to this, since we all now the dragon bloodline has been completely wiped out.they have no place in the future at all .
The fact that we didn't know who most of the actors were made it so easy for us to imagine the world they were in and the actions they would take in the situations they were placed at.
this teaser sucked...
Great Doctor Who is a Targaryen.😐
I didn't even know the trailer was out!I saw it on Tiktok😅
Wow just like Hollywood the moment something takes off they fill every position with already famous faces. When a lot of the success of Game of Thrones was that we didn't know who the actors were for the most part.
Yeeeaahhh bring it on baby it's targaryn time Madness in the air
So cool! I love Olivia Cooke!
I love this comment section!!! Guessing HBO is still in denial
Yikes!  This Time Lord looks like he’s regenerated into Draco Malfoy! 😳🤣🤣  Sit down 🤡
Zzzzzzzz
I don’t know if my heart take any more disappointments after last season.
Piles HBO hindi dabbing i love ❤ 😍 game of thrones love all Indian
What??? No black Targaryans??? What is this racist shit??? Be ASHAMED!!!
So, is this the period of the Targaryen civil war and the 'Dances of Dragon'?
happy leif erikson day!!!
Valar Morghulis!
Finally 🔥
Good old vibe ....damn 🔥
Can't wait for all the YouTube videos years from now.  "Why the first 4 seasons of Game of thrones worked and House of dragons didn't" or  "Why House of Dragons work and the last 4 seasons of GOT didn't"  The internet is predictable
I hated the end of GoT but I’m still psyched about this.
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did... and bowties are cool"
Honestly. This is like a disrespectful slap on the face to all the 18.5 MILLION fans who signed a goddamn fucking petition for remaking ONE fucking season of GoT. They spent 70 fucking MILLION on Zack Snyder’s Justice League and wasn’t able to remake a single season of once the best TV show on this planet. Its just blatant disrespect.
I'm about halfway through GOT again. Only my 2nd time watching it through. What great timing! 🙌
Let's get it🔥
DIOSMIO
Fuck yes Matt Smith
SPOILER ALERT - THE SERIES ENDS WITH SOMEONE HIDING THREE DRAGON EGGS AWAY SOMEWHERE. LOL
I. DON'T. CARE.  Finish 'Winds of Winter', George!
When i saw the thumbnail i thought it was Vergil from Devil May Cry
"The iron throne now looks exactly how the books described it" RLY?
Still pretty dark I see.
Ah I’m so not a fan of the Targaryens but I am looking forward to the show
Hope this will be a masterpiece just like the original show. What came before, much much eager to know..
This better be the best you guys can do, you have a lot to make up for. We didn't forget the last season, unfortunately.
Waiting for this yesssss
MATT SMITHHHH
<3
Black Targaryen's?  It's official, I've seen it all now.
Szkoda, że HBO nie robiło wiedźmina
Too disappointed with how Game Of Thrones ending got handled. Not willing to invest any time into something related in any way, shape or form.
Nobody:   HBO: LAAAAA laaaaa…. La-la-LAAAA laaaa
they could not go three years with out a reboot spin off after GOT terrible ending
porco dio sium
I don't really care anymore :P
Well apparently Targaryens only became hot in Danys generation.
Just so you guys know, the story in this is already finished in Fire and Blood, and I've read Fire and Blood. Plus, the writer of the show created Colony.  It'll be goood
Seeing the dragon in action would have been nice
In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the Valyrians are famous for having silver-gold (platinum blonde) hair, very pale skin, and violet-purple eyes. Hair color can vary from white to silver to gold, and eye color from lilac to deep purple, and sometimes blue. Did HBO even read the book or it's just trends? Lord Corlys character looks stupid.
I tried watching GOT about 3 times, but it bored the fuck out of me. Let's hope this one is actually wathchable
*Evidently a lot of people who clearly haven't read ASOIAF and therefore don't appreciate how lucky it was that anyone even attempted to do a tv adaptation of it*
Casting fail. Should of just spent the money on redoing last season of Game of Thrones🐲
I'm ready.
For me GoT ended on season 4, hope this show is better than the last four seasons of GoT.  BTW I hope that the theory with Bran is just a theory, Bran was a boring character.
Ah Doctor we meet again
What's the point if the last season is just 2 tiktok videos lol fuck off wasting our time
I'm not impressed - whether it's the overall look of it, the questionable casting choices, the lack of any substance in the trailer, we know what's going to happen to all of them, there's no intrigue the way that the first one had . The level of production seems lower in comparison to GOT.  The only possible positive is if this series will eventually lead to a resurrection scene of Daenerys Targaryen by the red priests which the previous series seemed to have hinted as a possibility but never followed. I'll give it a try but i'm very skeptical about the quality of this show.
Thanks but no thanks. Rather watch paint dry. At least it will not let me down.
"queen of the ashes" or just, y'know, dead.
How many seasons before the showrunners decide to check out and, "kind of forget"?
*Funny how many people who claim they won't be watching HotD due to S8 of GoT also chose to watch this trailer & then post a comment about how they apparently won't be watching it*
I won't be able to watch it knowing how bad things got after 200 years 😉
See Matt Smith Must watch show.
I am ready to get hurt again
I want Henry Cavill to play Aegon the Conqueror
Yeah if they didn’t fuck up the last season of GoT I’d be a lot more stoked about this
OMG 😍😍😍😍😍 GOT new chapter 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol all the actors look like the store brand version of the original GoT cast.
is this the throne that was forged from the thousands of swords of warriors who defeated the Targarians?  what the fuck???
Saw the words HBO on the trailer and threw up in my mouth a little bit, lol, still sick over what they did to GOT...its unforgivable,  really hope they hire actual writers and really finish the story instead of forcing it.....I know one thing though, after what happened they will never get another cent of my money, lol
Why does this trailer portray what seems to be some Targaryens or Velaryons, as black when we know the valyrian ethnicity was white and we know that non of the characters I am guessing they will play, were black either
you fucking destroyed got forever.
Not even gonna watch this shit.  Goes to show how lazy writters can ruin a franchise.
When are you going to remake the last 2 seasons to make GOT great again?
The dragons were the only thing I liked about GOT so I’m definitely watching this 🥴
The ending of this spinoff NEEDS to be Daenerys being resurrected by the Red Priests
Neh... race swaping bullshit
I just wanna see Balerion, The Black Terror
You're one of my favorite YouTube artist. We'll have regrets for things we did not participate in.Investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life.
What's the point?. If the ending of season 8 was better I would be looking forward to it. Don't get your hopes up people.
That’s the freaking rouge prince my people
Una gran casa y le hicieron desaparecer de la manera más estúpida 🤦‍♀️
Try not to screw this one up.
*yawn*
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Hope it'll have a good ending ...
Meh
Let's see how they push diversity and sjw bs
Please don't break our hearts again...
I cannot wait. This is going to be a ride.
Doctor what are you doing there
Iron throne looks so good
YES!!!! 😍😍😍
omg is this real or a fan edit???
So we lost this legendary house because Bran wanted to be king ah
No. You didn’t stick to the source last time…you’re NOT sticking to the source this time so…No.
They butchered S8 and won't admit it, address it, and made no attempt to remake it, which would have been profitable for them and been a sign of good faith to the fans.  I don't know why they butchered it. But I'm sure if we knew the reason, it would be infuriating. Something to do with greed on the part of HBO, arrogance on the part of the writers, or something equally disgusting.  Please don't forget this. They want to move on like they did nothing wrong. And make $millions off of everyone's two-second memory.
HBO kind of forgot that every prequel is pointless because it ends with nonsense.
So that's what happened when TARDIS left Doctor somewhere in early dark ages, it seems like he went a bit mad after that.
Cancel house of dragon!!!  Black washing shit..
IT’S MOTHERFUCKING MATT SMITH BABY YES
Are there black Targaryens? LOL
i know that I risk inciting some hurtful replies, but I watched the first few episodes of GoT and didn't really like it.
Please no more :(
HoD, Amazon's LOTR, Witcher.... finally good time arrived for fantasy genre audience 😀
Ain't no one watching this after the S8 debacle. 🙄
How many seasons? Obviously we know everyone will die and there is a 90% chance HBO will fuck it UP.
#JusticeForDaenerys
Where are the dragons??????????🙄🙄🙄🙄
wait. but didnt actually a targaryen dreamt the valyrian doom making them left the empire and survive? so technically a dream made them kings
HBO is still around? hmm..
So are we starting with the conquest of Westeros?I really wanna see the day  that guy finishing his biggest  palace in Westeros and then Aegon Lands  in Kings Landing
Bah! I don’t think there’s much interest after D&D messed up the last quarter of GOT!  looks below at the view count   Ohhfffffffff!
Matt Smith is intriguing but this smacks of a shameless money grab combined with "hey we know we screwed up so we're giving you all this Do you like us now?" At least they didn't hire novice jerks to show run this one like they did for GoT.
Super
Audience: kids too young to have seen the good seasons of GOT...
🌹Can’t wait 😍.🌹
i kinda liked dragons in got, but i definitely didnt give a fuck about targaryans...from my point of view i dont give a fuck ...at all.literally any other got family spin off would make me more intrested
It will make a profit, so it will be deemed succesful... Nobody I know really cares. GOT is dead.
Bring it.
As long as David and Dan are nowhere near the production of this then it will have a chance to be decent.
wow, so bland... well non of this matters cus we know how shitty all this is gonna end.
Finaly the history of the family that didn't mean shit at the end.
oooooooo this is hype
Yeah I still can't get over my heartbreak and trauma S8 caused me...
i bet this will be worse than the last season of GOT straight up https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCchGaT0slcvGn6RqBVamS_g
At the end of the day, rather the season, it will only disapoint us.  Anyway, i will still wait for this. I hope it has a plenty of sex and murders. Thats all. Bye.
fuck this shit imma go re read berserk
The Doctor on a new adventure
Ramsey Bolton's voice
"Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did." Bran: ... ... ... ... ... ... *Laughs in chair*
Now that it how you make a good trailer, just enough to give a taste of the series without ten million jump cuts.
മലയാളി ഒന്നും ഇല്ലേടാ ......
Wayyyyyyy better Iron Throne!
Is it just me or it sounded like ramsay Bolton..
Better watch out for the killing bricks.
Well, I know a guy, who was made a king by tales…  *looks at producers list* *notices absence of dumb and dumber*  I will give this show a chance
Knock Knock,  Who's there, Dr Who's Dragon, Dr who's dragon who? Dr Who's dragon the game of throne plot out a bit more.
Probably the last to notice this but I like how the shot is of a dragon/ dragon skulls (aka dragons) when he says Gods. Very appropriate
Season 8 was Jon Snow whisper shouting ‘My Queen’ nonstop.
Matt Smith looks like off brand Geralt
This will cover the Dance of The Dragons right?? The Targaryen civil war?
Oh finally i can't wait ✌
Would this series be so exciting and wonderful that people hold watch parties and made spoilers an actual trauma, and then have the writers failing to wrap up all those exciting plot points in a satisfying end, leading to a disappointing 8th season?  YASS CAN'T WAIT
Ohhh, yes, baby... 😍😍😍🤤🤤
Game of Clones
Remake the final season why don't ya
*0:49** - **0:50* The woman looks like daenerys from behind.
hope you fired got writers from season 7/8
Oh yes, the famous black Targaryens 🤣
Oh come on atleast show a glimpse of a dragon for fucks sake
Will this be just about the Targaryen civil war or the Blackfyre rebellion included?
So move into my new place set up an amazing theater  Set up an amazing theater in my van and watch this with my dog
Ok! I see you!
Finally the Wait is over 💕
This already looks like trash and i have watched 1 minute and 17 seconds of it
you better not fuck this up
Hahahahahaha😂🤣
In 0:43, from the two knights, one is Ser Criston Cole "The Kingmaker", one time lover of Rhaenyra and Kingsguard that fought for the Greens and the second is of House Tarly. The reason why is because of his shield, with ten black pellets, on a scarlet field
Finally 🙂🥰
I can already tell who the villian is, it's the guy who's with his mother by the beach
I’m ready for more GoT - when (if?) George RR Martin finishes his story and makes up for the garbage that HBO called the last 2 seasons of the show. In the meantime, we have this cash grab from HBO.
Meh. No matter how much they try to milk this franchise it's over. This show was the biggest disappointment of the decade.
All that fighting just for Bran to win it all.
Stop, get some help.
Going to rule seires world
Roberts rebellion would be a fantastic hit 🙄 rather than more dragons i think
Personally I was never massively interested in dragons in the first place, what I really liked was the semi-historical inspiration and the faint HINT of fantasy of the first seasons. I liked the "plots and schemes" (quote), court intrigue, and the occasional but very good action shot. I hope this will deliver on that end.
"The Iron Throne will look closer to the book description" It's the same fucking set piece, they just dropped a box of tin foil on the floor lol
https://youtu.be/i1iAU6DInpI Glimpse video leaked..
Finally we'll learn why the sound of ringing bells makes Targaryen's want to slaughter the innocent.
Just. Don’t. Rush. It.
please please please don't be "woke"
The Iron Throne really needs a lot of work to be done on it. That's not a thousand swords. That's barely a hundred...
No Hodor😔
And everyone claps and says they cant wait forgetting the last 2 seasons of Game of thrones. Just like Star Wars sequels  but people still clap and are happy becuse people are hollow and empty and need any distraction to divert the fact that life has no meaning and they will all be dead soon.
Wonder if they should have done this first seeing as it's completely written. And maybe put off the incomplete part until it was done.... But what do I know.
GOT's last season showed a new level of inattention to details. How come an entire set not notice plastic bottles? Not to mention the writing. Not interested in any HBO production after this.
você não me desaponte novamente viu dona HBO?
Where is the Hindi trailer
Can't wait to be massively disappointed again.
GOT foi a melhor série que já assistir, tô muito ansioso pra essa
Setting us up for disappointment again.
why is Ramsay Bolton's voice used here?
NED STARK NEEDS TO BE BACK AND HAVE A LONGER ROLE .. 🥲
Neden Türkiye'ye gelmedin eyy HBO Max, zalimin oğlu ☹️
THE OLD IRON THRONE DESERVED TO BE BACK
Omg Matt Smith!
🤮
Finally! So thrilled. Cant wait to watch!
the cinematography of it all makes it feel more like The Witcher more than GOT
At first I thought I was watching a Witcher trailer.
Should be great without 'dumb and dumber' as writers and with an already huge fan base they are sure to put a lot of effort into this one , I am excited.
Dreams didn't make us King 👑 Brandon ~ 😟🏃‍♂️
9.7M views im sure that im responsible for 9M
It'd be better if it had been about Aegons conquest rather then about 200 Years of soapy politico drama of the Targaryans that led to the end of all the dragons. I couldn't bring myself to see the 2 dragons dying in GoT, set aside seeing 20 of them die all at once in just one battle--
0:29 I really really hope it's just the lighting and her eyes aren't actually fucking light blue. I have a loooot of faith that this show will turn out much better than the 2nd half of GoT but I'm seein stuff like this and I'm praying it's just the lighting or they didn't do it for the trailer but cmooon HBO....
This better be good!! Also where are the beautiful Targaryen ladies? I haven’t seen any yet
Didn't realise just how much I forgot about this show since what happen in last season, until I saw the ad in youtube...
House of stark... Da best 💯💯
WHO. IS. MAKING. IT? D&D? PLEASE GOD NO IF SO
No thanks
Is that the doctor?
Nope. No more high-hopes.
Ive read the short cut of the books and story, and i look forward to this
HBO should have redid season 8. Too many fans lost interest in the series terrible finale. Sadly this show will flop as a result.
Hope you don't end this like shit
Looks shit
We’ll time for me to reread Fire and Blood
"Chills literal chills"
Look like more of season 8. Kewl.
Gotta admit the Iron Throne looks a lot cooler this time. More spiky and jagged and much less looking like something at Madame Tussauds
I just hope they a actually write a decent story this time that makes sense
Ufff 🔥🔥🔥🔥
House of the dragon... I'M IN!!!! House of the dragon composer: Ramin Djawadi.... I'M ALL IN!!!!!
One of my problems with the GOT series is they kept recasting characters. Rhaegar looked stupid in the show too. Not at all how you would imagine he would look. He should have looked more like henry cavill from the witcher, and if thats supposed to be rhaegar in this trailer. lame.
What is doctor who doing here?
This is what everyone is waiting for😍.  Just hope if bran didn't f*cked someones mind in past.
Damn,I've been missing the IRON throne
And who is filming this? The same "masters" that the last 3 seasons destroyed? "Strong and independent" instead of high-quality fantasy?
I hope there will be explaination about WHITE WALKER
Let’s GOOOOOOOOOO And I just recently caught up☺️
'Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did.' 'Hold my chair' - Bran
Too late. Nobody cares.
❤️
Normally I would look forward to this but it's another distraction/excuse for George R.R. Martin to not finish the GoT book series so I'm not going to bother with this.
Boo!
I think there is no serie can replace game of thrones
Not sure if I'm going to waste my time watching it the way they screwed up in the end of Game of Thrones The Sopranos the list goes on with HBO's bad history of messing up the endings of shows
just gonna google real quick who the writers are and making sure its not D&D. If it is im not gonna watch it  Edit: its not them im gonna give it a try
F this. HBO botched the last 2 seasons of game of thrones. Why the hell would we watch the spin off, you fuckin hacks
So this is what the doctor did in his off seasons.
We want it in hindi dubbed
"It's not the same bro. U r not dat guy."
Let’s not rush to end this one then yeah! Still not over that giant turd season 8 was.
Ohhhh my FAWKING GAWDDDDDDDD
I HATE that I'm excited for this. Like i wanna be past GoT but I just got goosebumps all over my body like the basic consumption minded nerd that i am
Final scene: Bran wakes up, it was all a dream.  It would be the only way to get a worse ending.
Oh sweet!!! Is this the retcon remake of Season 8?
After the way you ended the first masterpiece, you think I'm going to stick around to watch you ruin the second? Please.
I'm hyped!
Please, oh please, don't let D&D come anywhere near this
So technology didn’t progress much in 200 years huh
Holy shit
This is going to be awesome. Personally I'd love a spin off series about king Roberts rebellion.
Finally they copied something cleverly
The first episode is going to be pitch black dark
Trailer looks amazing I don’t get the hate!
My boy Matt Smith!
Чернокожие блондины?
I just want to know if HBO is gonna cheap out on this one too and ruin the end of it. Thus, negating the whole series like the original. You've already ruined the original and the Titans that I love so please don't ruin the history of the Targaryen's. Though Titans has been bad from start to end due to poor writing and a general lack of understanding of the DC characters. Season 8 was your sin for GoT.
It’s all fun and games until you remember that this bloodline is extremely inbred because they decided “keep it in the family” was a very good idea.
Games of thrones s9 needs to come out

House of the Woke-Ass Dragons
Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Matt Smith though!! Gives me hope!
Can anybody tell me how GoT ends in the books ? I mean does jon snow become king ?
Save yall some time. It'll be shit. Have a good day!
I have such low expectations after the crap D&D made.
Another black people, who play white. It's demeaning to black people, not respect. Not to mention that it's not canon. When will this pseudo-liberal schizophrenia end?
Omg yesssss please tell me same writer as the first few seasons on GOT
I'll pass
Spin-offs! Just kill me already
OMG
Black Velaryons. omG🤦
Milkin the dead cow.
https://youtu.be/zQW7qkeB7XA
Can't wait
What's east of eastoros?
Good
This looks good and it will probably be an ok show. We know how this story ends we didn't know how GoT ended  and that was a major appeal since anything could happen.  I would much prefer HBO to redo season 7-8 of the show instead of a new show.
Oh man, not sure i am up for another disappointment.
That's it?
Oh god not again just let it go
They will suck us into it and then shit all over us at the end.... is it even worth it?
Almost 10M Lets go
Won't fool me twice
cant wait for the lord of the rings and this 2022
Never saw GoT,  should I watch this “prequel” then proceed with GoT?  (Honestly just lazy)
new got ?
Wow cant wait to see wich houses survive and wich die out!
The final 2 seaons of game of thrones ruined any interest or hype I had for the spin-offs as well...
Jesus is returning soon! He is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Turn away from your sins and your past and receive Him as your LORD and Saviour right now. The Bible says that if you confess with your mouth the LORD Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. God bless you.   To my brothers and sisters in Christ, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15) We are in the final hours!
Dommage que ce soit en anglais 😥. Sinon il me tarde.... c'est génial
Ё мае они на турнире разделитель не нормальный. Надеюсь костюмерный цех изменил подход . И не будет стыдно смотреть на доспехи
I expect something epic :) fingers crossed
You want a second chance?
Not very impressed if I’m being honest!
No. Not after you f*cked up royally. I choose not to. Maybe in 15 years. Probably not even then.
My plan telegram😂😂😂
How can any one care?!? The way GoT ended, I have no interest in seeing these stories due to the fact they all are heading to season 8.  Really really pointless to watch the history of a failed TV show.  Dan and Dave are responsible for this mess. Sue the shit out of them for complete incompetence.
I don't know but I have a dangerous feeling that it will all go to hell in just the first season.  They still haven't made the targaryen correct. They are supposed to be of white hair and purple eyes and I'm pretty sure all of them were white. They should have picked the argon conquest instead of this. As we could have seen the dragons win for once at the ending. Even if the show picks up in the first season it will go bad for a lot of viewers as no body likes to watch dragons die and there will be a lot of dragon deaths in this series as I have read all fire and blood book.
after the disaster that was season 8 i am surprised people are still exited for this
https://youtu.be/GJBLXqA0RhU
A lot of PC Content, not worth watching.
Dude is like the Witcher version of George McFly. And yeah, we have Ciri and a Witcher Ezekiel as well.
Matt Smith!!!
I hope to watch more sex and nude scenes like it was in game of thrones 😋
Cape de cazz...
Hell yeah so pumped up for this!
Can't wait for it.
Release hindi dubbed official
Dracarys 🔥🔥🔥🐲
O universo de Game of Thrones está de volta 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
M so exited for GOT 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
this shit gave me goosebumps oml cant wait
Hope the creators are not the same....
i hope this ending could be better than GOT
Ofc the doctor is there ...pulling his best Geralt of Rivia look and he also has a ciri
*Читаешь мой коментарий, желаю тебе и твоей семье, крепкого здоровья!*
Matt Smith?! Oh this ought to be good! I'm gonna watch it!
omg, this make me so excited despite the shitty two years we had.
Now thats the iron throne i know!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
ok why is no one talking about this??
So excited.. Missing game of thrones and now waiting for 2022
House Of The Dragon is coming to dragen picture coming to tha max in HBO 2022
Dreams didn't make us kings ... Dragons did 🔥🔥🔥
I just can't find any excitement for it. I want to, but I think most people have moved on from it now. It was like the Hobbit movies, when they finally came out, people had largely lost interest.
Waiting  ❤️
Is the girl at 0:34 Lagertha?
Hopefully no PC stuff, like a transgender Dragon.
Glad to see Matt Smith in more things. I wish he did more voice acting though, his voice is so good
I’m very hesitant to get excited. GOT had the world in their hands (including me, we had shownights with our friends every episode, and that with this day and age). Then the finals happened and I get sad whenever I see something from the series.  Will watch it. But man what a comedown that this is.
The last season wasn't that Bad
This is going to have a shit ending.....I can just feel it.
If u hope this flim is happy ending. You should hold your emotional lol
Tell me tell me it's d&d free, otherwise I'm not gonna watch it.
Please do not fuck this up, thanks.
Is that The Doctor?!
this better be damn good.
The music for this show will be Epic 😃😃
HBO BETTER NOT FUCKING RUIN THIS
Cercei: where are my elephants? D&D: No elephants.   Rheanerya: where are my dragon? GRRM: yes.
The black brotha with the white dreads looks god like
❤️❤️❤️
I've never watched any of this stuff but because Matt Smith is in the trailer I may watch this show just not the game of thrones series
WOAH LOOKS COOL
Man...! this time the iron throne looks good
purple eyes still too hard to do?
Dear HBO max_ (House of the Dragon) Please release in Hindi.  🇮🇳🙏😇❤️
I don't have high hopes for this show or its casting choices, but I think Matt Smith will be amazing as Daemon
Wasn’t letting us down the first time enough? 💔 I’m still recovering.
Let's hope there are only 7 seasons this time.
"hey look these idiots are going to watch another series that we'll ruin"
Probably gonna be dogshit
Да наварить бабла на франшизе это святое )) сейчас любое говно зайдет под этим именем. Как форсажи снимают пачками.

00:19 is that "Balerion" the black dreed...
Are D&D involved with this? IF so, i'll skip it.
I can't say it looks good...
Can’t wait
POR FIN!!!!
Why does the narrator sound like Ramsey Bolton ?
Cast looks boring!
Hindi dubbed plass
Is this before or after the events of the original game of thrones?
Got goosebumps from this one!
I hope this ends better than the last series. 🙄
Why it feels like GAME OF THRONES
After the last GoT seasons fiasco/fraude, I'm not gona keep my hopes up.
I thought HBO had given up on anything Game of Thrones related after the disastrous seasons 7 & 8.
Only going to watch this because of Matt Smith
House dayne wasnt explained in got. I expect a brief explanation on house dayne in hod.
I have no faith.
After the butchering of the GOT ending I couldn’t give 2 shits about this
Looking forward to Daemon and Aemond's battle on dragon back above the god's eye 😍 also I really want to know how Rhaenys Targaryn will be depicted, she was almost chosen as a queen in her time (but wasn't at last because of shitty will of king Jahearys) was a skilled warrior and dragon rider and also one of Rhyneria's chief counselors.
Give us a show about Starks of Winterfell not fucking incestuous lizard lovers.
Money money money money money we can't keep doing this Bob
Wow..... Just amazed ... So much hype for what have to come 😁💥
HBO max is producing Good Shows 👍
Finally something exciting after 2020 and all it’s depression and misery!
I still wish they had started with Aegon the conqueror though!! I just really wanted to see that in action.
This was the chance to build a better throne!!!
I cant help hut think which celebrities have the "look" of a Targaryen. Lol
Yaas, Black targeryens🥰. Finaly some representation 😁😁😍
Ghosts  of Seasson 8 will haunt this Show.... Real fans of GoT will never forgive HBO for butchering our favorite Show...
Please we want to see game of throne season 9🥺
I haven’t forgiven the woke mess the game of thrones became. So it’s hard to get excited. I will wait until it’s all done watch reviews by honest reviewers be I can dedicate my time again. But it looks great but it’s down to the writing and consistency.
Wow
wait thats mat smith
i pray to the new gods, the old gods and the lord of light give us a good ending
The casting for this show is pretty trash ngl
The Bran jokes in the comments is what I came here for. Thank you all for not disappointing... Unlike D&D <_<
finally a trailer instead of a dumbass animation, or a fan made trailer labeled as an "official trailer".
BRING IT ON........
Its weird that it feels good to not see a lot of positive comments
Wow! Would I again get to see women and children burned alive screaming for help? What Fun! Is this show actually going to show dragons or again keep viewers waiting for the next episode endlessly? Can't wait!
Are there black vallaryians in the books or is this just following the current trend of pandering to the woke brigade?
Melisandre should have a cameo in this show i hope, she alive in this time period
This only makes me think of the past season
Will this be a better story than Bran the cripple?
Waiting patiently
I cant bare a black man in the movie
Doctor Targaryen?
This just made my day 🔥
Funny how in 200 years nothing seems to have changed. Same gear same castles same dragons lol
We want the story about the the first great war with the white walkers not the same old politics of the 7 kingdoms
How many seasons will this show have ?
Disliked because season 8 still stings
Stick to the original stories this time your jags
Repeat?? No thanks...
As long as they don't butcher it all
Will it suck too at the end?
Oh boy. Can't wait to see how they fuck it up this time lol
can't wait!!!
Please have better lighting this time🤦🏾‍♀️
Daemon was a badass in the books, now he is being played by Matt Smith? Hell yes!
I want dany
I love how the next recommended video for me is a pisstake on GoT, the internet remembers
it's a spin-off about dragons and they didn't show us a single living dragon...
Brat stark is coming to ruin them
No dragons, should have shown some dragons
shit doctor who died his hair.
This will be fire ... literally
Maybe plan the ending carefully this time around? Get good writers on board when things go south? Don't get too woke and pretentious? Don't rush character arcs and plot points for spectacle? Then maybe I'll tune in...
Is that ramsay bolton's voice
Whats the issue between you and brightness????
Is it witcher
I hope they make it unapologetic please don't make a PC/feminists bullshit series coz I won't watch that shit
HBO Execs: We are once again asking for your financial support.
All i can think is dr who🤦
Go fix your series first. Reshoot Season 8 2022.
Hello to everyone who's still watching this Trailer. I know that this isn't related to the Trailer, but if you happened to stumble upon this comment, then feel free to watch this video as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbpVaNLOIF4   You should also check the description of the video to gain additional information. Thank you and have a nice day!
Goosebumps*
Жду с огромным нетерпением! Надеюсь это будет нечто столь же великое!!
Hmmmm....We'll see....
อันนี้ที่เป็นภาคแยกใช่มั้ย น่าดูมากคุณภาพสุดๆ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Black Velaryons... let's hope they will not appear too much.
https://youtu.be/TvbtAAKsTgY😇😇
More incest and bewbs!!
Soooo which Damond Targaryen is this? The one from Dance of Dragons? Or the Blackfyres?
Would've much preferred The Winds of Winter book to this.
This arc is completed in the book, eager to see how truly they adapt to it.
Not sure that I can stomach this, after the dumpster fire of the finale of GOT. D&D really reuined the SOIAF adaptations for so many.
Oh look, it's woke GoT
this better be coming to the UK on SKY/NOW
who is/are the writer(s) though? y'know... just making sure this will not be a shitshow in the end.
danny's ancestors yo
This series will not be good as there will be not any white walker There will be only civil war for the iron throne I will miss the wall, night's watch,night king,army of the dead,white walkers😭😭
I dont care what people say about House of Dragon.. I'm flipping hyped 😱
please dub in hindi this series
I just came to dislike for what you did to season 8
Sorry, but GOT was ruined by that god-awful last season and ending. Not interested anymore. You guys have fun.
0:42 Who is this woman?
Why are there so many "black targeryans"? Targareyens were known for pale complexion, silver hair and purple eyes. I swear I will rate it 1/10 if I get stupid diversity crap in it.
wooow........amazing,Waiting Eagerly
Please do hindi dubbed also plezzzz
Honestly, the gross total of grrm's work could yield into so many series, like aegon's conquest, dance of dragons(this one), the blackfyre rebellion, dunk and egg(ongoing novellas) and even probably Robert's rebellion or some animated series.
Cercei: where are my elephants? D&D: No elephants.   Rheanerya: where are my dragon? GRRM: yes.
doctor who 11 got a new haircut it would seem
Matt smith? Ill give this a miss...
When I saw Matt Smith in the thumb, I assumed it was satire. Still not sure if it isn’t that subtle kind of Brit satire
Ready to witness Balerion the Black Dread ! 🔥
Im excited!
The Doctor still not Ginger
I hope they won't change shit from books just copy paste it man and it'll be blockbuster without a doubt
മലയാളി പൊളിയല്ലേ... എന്ന് മൊതലാളി പറയാൻ പറഞ്ഞു 😂😂😂💥💥🔥🔥😎
GOT was not just a show, it was having a world inside.
No
New song https://youtu.be/huXyHV4pUf4
Didnt know doctor who was a targaryen
Gaaayyy!
Alright I'm interested But I have to say, I really hope a lot of those extra swords slowly vanish until at the end of the series it looks like the Iron Throne in GoT if only for continuity. I know this is more closer to the books
HBO destroy the story and excitement of game of thrones in last season so half of the audience is not interesting in watching.
Goosebumps 😱
Hope they don't shit this time like they did in season 8.
Is that next part of game of thrones?
The Velaryons tho... I could never imagine a better casting than this! Especially for Corlys Velraryon. The only issue I see is probably that his eyebrows are a little too thin, but besides that 10 out of 10 for casting.
A diverse and woke kingdom before mid evil times lol Gotta love the stupidity of crazy Hollywood
plz, make a long tv serious. I want to watch this every day until I die
if you mess the last season i will be more than mad.
What if...Bran plays a cameo and alters the past?! To like, save the dragons for an upcoming threat (in his future) or something. Then, we see Jon Snow's descendants utilize the new dragons to fend off the new evil?
Where's is the dragons??
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Keep me hooked for 10 years and fail to deliver on the ending once, shame on you. Keep me hooked for 10 years and fail to deliver on the ending twice, shame on me.      Fail to give the Matt Smith character a blue, T.A.R.D.I.S. colored dragon, Kings Landing gets it in 200 years.
(Copy from my comment of the same video in another channel)A little education: Valeryons(seafarers with a sea horse as a sigil;shown at 0:38-0:39) are closely related to Targaryens and as a matter of fact both were of valyeria, who escaped before it's doom. They bear a strong resemblance to targs i.e they were very very white and had silver white hair and blue and in some cases purple eyes. That is why when targs couldn't find a sibling to marry they looked towards valyerions to keep the blood of valeyria  pure. They were a great house during the civil war/dance of dragons.   Moving on, the dornish(most of them) due to huge influx of rhyonish(river people of East) blood have wheatish or olive skin and are comparably said too look like some latinos and South Asians. And so does the people of essos in large number look a bit darker than people of westroes who are white because of their andal and first men ancestry.   The people of Yi Ti in far east look like east Asians while the people of summer islanders look like natives of much of africa.   So there is no lack of racial diversity in grrm's world but the showrunners still decided to fuck it up. And it is not of a charcter whose race doesn't matter, but of character whose relation to targs due to the sole fact that they are very VERY similar. As a reader of asoiaf who have read all books(including companion and side story) I could have done a better job in casting than the lazy fucks hbo chose. If you adapt something that is a fan favourite you gotta stick to the source material which Martin has thankfully completed(for this part) or get something like GoT S7-S8.  Why do you need to make Peter Parker black when there is miles morales.?
So uh, you guys don't feel like you have fucked up GOT enough? Got to kick it while it's down? Can't wait to see how you shit on this story line. Jk. Not even worth it
Well, ...seems intriguing enough.  If it's written and directed by the same people who brought us the last GOT series, it could be great.   ...I just hope they don't make the same mistake they made with the last series and just sort of fizzle out in the last season,   ...and ESPECIALLY don't go trying to shove SJW politics down everyone's throats, as has been a common theme in the last few years throughout the movie, television and gaming industries. Many great franchises have been completely ruined because of that.  Believe what you want to believe, but keep politics out of entertainment, aside from natural aspects of the plot.  If you try to artificially sneak things in under the radar, people WILL notice, and it will likely have a profoundly negative impact on ratings.  "Get woke, go broke", has become almost an natural law,  comparable and as immutable as ones like the second law of thermodynamics and inverse square law. Don't do it,  ...or do.  ...You can't say you weren't warned though. 😉 🙃🤪
I am sorry, but the ending of the last attempt was so bad, why would anyone invest time in this
Hope they dont fuck up the ending like last series.
YES MORE HOT WOMEN!
0:41 That's freaking Dracula back there!! Graham McTavish is the one actor that got me excited for this show
Nememes
I'm very skeptical about this, I'll watch it just because is from ASOIAF. Hopefully George RR Martin will finish Winds of Winter by next year.
They could literally do 10 season of this but I doubt it goes pass 1
Soon....
two days already and there is 21k comments,
Finally dragons getting justice, cant wait to watch aegon and rhaegar
Hopefully this will help us forget season 8
Cool but…eh
Don't care - still not gonna re-subscribe to HBO after Dumb & Dumber's betrayal.  I might give the books a try if G.R.R. ever finishes (doubt it now, but at least I enjoyed the first 5 , & with how "the Critical Drinker fixes GOT" giving me an ending that works & was brilliant, G.R.R. can rest, it has to be hard for a man his age to keep with a story he started decades ago now).  I'm not so much bitter (life does not revolve around a show or story), but when you crap all over a story that people invested their heart into don't expect everyone to come back and give this world/story another try.  If it turns out to be good, great I'll give it a go someday, but I have far to many other books & shows to catch up on before I ever revisit a GOT theme show.
Don’t mess up like GOT last season
So long as season 8 is Canon, I'm good with not watching this show
0:38 Black Targarien ?
The origin to the story that nobody wanted to hear.
Can't wait to see Mega Drogon / Vhagar
Completely uninterested in this one
None of these people look like Targaryens they look like meh actors in silver wigs. I was under the impression that they were supposed to be one of the most beautiful races the rest of the actors in different houses look better.
I’d be more excited if Season 7 wasn’t a thing, but it is….”Bran the Broken” …so fuckin stupid
Is the Doctor up to something again?
Well I suppose this is more interesting than what happens under King Bran.
I thought Targaryans are supposed to be good looking 🤔
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😬😬😬😬😬😬
Before the fall of game of thrones series 😂
Luckily this story is finished in the books, hopefully that limits how badly they ruin it this time
If this show doesn't have a grimy Lannister or a Stark with integrity, i don't want it
Didn't even watch the trailer. @HBO fùčked up GOT so badly no one cares about it anymore. Lol. Just stop
GOT season 0
Princess Rhaenys Velaryon Team
Racial politics ruins another one. Visual biological dissonance.
This is going to suck.
Dreams didn't make us kings....  Bran the broken: "oh henlo! I just dreaming while these guys killed each other and here I am, a broken king for a broken season!"
Iam excited to see dragons it's kinda cool and Iam obsessed with game of thrones I hope that this will be better then got💥💥💥💥
yeah after that last season, I'll pass
wtf is that a black valyrian???? dafuq? What is this ? It officially screws up the whole point of valyrians. House Velarion is VALYRIAN DESCENT. Dont force diversity people. I am from a minority too, Im a mix asian and pacific islander but I wouldn't want The Rock to be cast as George Washington.
Can’t wait! Let’s go
D&D betrayed us; the north remembers!
D and D aren't involved in any shape or forme on this new show so that's already a positive sign. Let's hope the new team don't fall into the same mistakes the infamous duo did.
This and that Amazon's lotr gives me unwanted tummy aches
HOLA JUAN CARLOS
Waiting from #India 🤩🤩
I know it’s not being run by D&D but does anyone really have any interest unless after what happened with 8?
so no Balerion?
Dosen't matter as we know the person who is ultimately gonna sit on the Throne.   The useless three eyed raven   Poor Dany she didn't deserve it 😭😭
0:38 the all-seeing and all-hearing Heimdall, is that you?
Pft
I can't wait to see this.
dudley the dragon?
I might watch it after the last season 😌
That Corlys Velaryon lmao
this looks woke af
Want to see Jon's mother
Im calling it now, this is going to be shite
200 years before the ruined tv series
Santo cielo omg ostia tío chaval la madre que me parió fierro pariente puro pa delante andamias al millon y pasaditos, que joya 😍😍😍😍🥵🤭😈
ok so the original pilot of got was april 17, 2011. what if this airs april 17, 2022 since it’s a sunday as well
I don't like the fact that the Targaryens look super pale in this show. Also my condolences to Corlys for winning the diversity lottery.
What could you possibly show in the past so awesome in contrast to a shitty ending? You've already ruined it for so many out there
I'm eager to hear musics of this show And mostly intro music
in a world... where absolutely no advances in technology... of any kind.... ever occur.....
that spin off who got potential for becoming original.
Looks like shit.
Finally it arrived...
I wonder how many Doctor Who crossover fanfics will be born from this.
This looks like trash fuck I fucking knew I was going to be disappointed fuckkkkkk there’s nothing good anymore
Is it also available in Hindi dub
Vê se vocês não vão cagar o final igual fizeram com GOT.
Can't wait to see Milly Alcock in this. She tore it up in "Upright".
I wish they instead worked on the age of heroes
Don't poop in last seasons 😂
https://youtu.be/Je15rKfjSFk
How bad season eight was that it even tainted the prequel without even coming out yet. What about you spend that money remaking that shit of season instead?
Did I see black Targens in this trailer? What are they doing?
Hopefully they didn't employ dumb and dumber to ruin this one
I wonder if the creators will rush this one and ruin the ending so they can go do some Star Wars things...
so is this before after game of thrones?
I sort of expected him to act like the Doctor in between
Personally it’s hard care about the show after the train wreck of the final season of game of thrones. Will just wait until the last episode of the final season drops before watching the show, will read reviews first. Game of thrones should of went down as the greatest show of all time. Now I can’t ever imagine rewatching it or even having it in top 10 anymore, such a disappointment.
I watched the NK in S08 episode before deciding that I want to start watching GoT, was boring, is that considered a crime? Cause I feel it is xD
So fucking ready
Will they show mad king???
Didn't realise just how much I missed Game of Thrones until I watched this. Can't wait!
Naomi Watts, we have not forgotten you!!!!
Justice for dorne , we gotta see how the Targaryens and people of dorne were going to war for so long
"Hmmm, winds howling"
Дизлайк за не канон с неграми.
Maybe we'll learn some of the strategic battle plans to prepare us for season 8.....
I’m the doctor. I ride dragons now. Dragons are cool
Hi
The only thing that will redeem Game of Thrones is a remake, redo, or some other fix to Season 8. Nothing more, nothing less
Matt Smith is a good choice but I have 0 faith in the HBO storytelling team after the botched ending of Game of Thrones.
“If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.”
release in india then in hindi
Holy shiet
They better not let this end as badly as Game of Thrones
After season 8 fiasco  Dont give me hope
I am waiting for it forever....
Hope they don't fuck this up in the last season...
Epic.
Nope
The dragons should be able to talk
Oh my god
Etchaaaaa
That roar in the end🐲❤️
i can see an actor from the crown
Willing to see how they ruin the end
Is someone different directing it this time? Cause if not a lot of people are gonna pass on it.
https://youtu.be/AgN3IOSuXyc
I bumped into George Martin the other day & asked for an autograph. So far he's written George & told me he'll finish the autograph shortly. I have total confidence he will finish it for me.
NEW Drake leak on my channel!
Why can’t I see a fucking dragon in trailer ?
If my buddy is telling me a story, a pretty long story, and at the end he manages to boil the entire thing down to a complete nonsensical waste of my time, why the shit would him giving me more details about the beginning of said story make it any better at all? If you managed to ruin an entire hour long story with the last 5 minutes, what level of stupidity would it take for you to believe another 30 minutes at the beginning would fix it? I believe in comedy they call this the "shaggy dog story", I'll be damned if HBO isn't shooting for the longest shaggy dog in history. Norm is probably turning over in his grave.
is it GoT
I watched this trailer just to dislike it and see comments. But ngl. I might just watch it now
Still Disappointed from the last season finale.....
Give us Robert's rebellion for gods sake
fire
kings
gods
boom
garbage
Gonna skip this, but you all watch it so that they'll make The Long Night prequel. TEAM STARK!!!!! THE NORTH REMEMBERS!!!
I’m the Doc … Dragon!
instead of making a sequel, remake the ss8.
Looks amazing 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Damn, the targareyans gonna make the lannisters look like divine.
Sadly since we know how it ends in 230 years gonna half to pass.
6권은 언제나옴...
Cool story needs more dragons
Redo the last season
They both die queen Rhaenyra Targaryen gets feed to her brother aegon second dragons. Then he gets poison then queen rhaenyra son Aegon 3rd became king and married aegon second last daughter. Have a nice day.
Mỗi tôi người Việt...
The greatest mystery of this world, The White Walkers, has already been spoiled. So what can this show really offer?
"So.. how should we add black people in a way that doesn't look like blatant pandering?"  HBO:...
They should postpone this, many people are STILL trying to recover from the dumpster fire ending to GOT.
hopefully GOT redeems itself with this
No mames ¿reebot? o ¿spin - off?
WE WUZ VALYRIANZ AND SHIEEEEETTTTT
Go Targaryen 🔥
Well, time to buy HBO again.
Finalllyyyyyyy something to watch on tv🙌
Fk you not watching. Dogshjt casting for pc reasons and muh diversity ruining the entire lore of the universe.
Is that the Doctor?
This poor thing died horribly, I don't want go back there.
No #EmiliaClarke's great great grandmother? WTH?
Don’t fuck it up. That’s all I’m asking.
DID HBO REALLY PUT IN A DOCTOR WHO MAIN CHARACTER. to help there GOT ending ****UP.
Just keep D&D THE HELL AWAY from it and it should be fine.
That's it HBO you hit that dead horse
🤣 this has a lot to live up to. Good luck
I wish we could have got Robert's Rebellion instead of this
Remember how they butchered the original series? The North remembers...
Stop making swords look heavy.......... Swords are not heavy.
This better not be Season 8 quality.
Noticing a lack of dragons
Eager to see the following sequences:  Velaryion preparing his war fleet. The wolfs of winter raiding the river lands as the savages they are. The Triarchy fleet sailing towards Westeros. The battle of the gullet. The riots in Kings Landing. Imagine these scenes charged with drama and epic music.
I just need Ramin Djawadi to come back
Awww i dont get to see jaeherys or aegon. Fuck
😀 já querooooo que venha 2022
the ending to GOT was so bad that im not watching this on general principle
Are those two A-holes who ruined the last 3 episodes of GoT writing this? If yes, then it is a pass.
AUDIO VOICE VISUAL VOICE OF A SERIES ACTOR DUBBED TO COMIC MAGAZINES TALKING ABOUT SUPERGIRL'S FLASH STORIES DC OF TOMORROW
Vão estragar tbm
Ruined games of thrones why should I watch this and expect any different…. Trash
h I just LOVE IT when former dr who's actors play the bad guys!
I used to love GOT , but after ending I just don't care anymore.........
The House Velaryon race switch looks so dumb and immersion breaking, yet no one is going to be allowed to criticize it. Tired of HBO shoehorning in this woke crap, and figured they would’ve learned from Bloodmoon. If they wanted POC involved, they could’ve done a story about The Summer Isles instead of this dumb shit.
Rather than treating us all like we're in an abusive relationship with expectations, how about just giving us one episode where Tyrion finishes his joke about the brothel.
Matt smith lol
D&D, we will never forget what you did.    Never.
Not interested due to S7/S8. Completely killed the franchise for me. Also the pureblood obsessed Targs look awfully diverse.
guys...black targaryens?....please...leave the BLMs LGTBB and all the fuck*ng liberal agenda out of this story...do not mess it up with your indoctrination, it sucks...
As a big fan of the Stark I wasn't excited about this but it's honestly look good. They just need to respect the source material and fans will definitely support it.
Life will finally have meaning again
House Targaryen looking like every high school swim team
DONT YOU DARE TO FUCK IT UP LIKE LAST SEASON OF GOT
Omg i almost cried
https://youtu.be/TpeCao-a-7I
Deli kral çok yaşaaaaaaa
Just came here to say I refuse to watch anything GoT after that final episode.   This must be erased from cultural history.
The only good part about this is Matt smith
I don’t trust and enjoy this franchise anymore after the disastrous finale of Game of Thrones. 😓
Dreams didn't make us kings, one of our guys had the best story
Rip Hodor
brace yourselves, missing plots are coming!
Im giving it a hard pass not putting years into another hbo show to get the ending like before
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BERkAxG8dcw
If you watch this you're a fookin kneeler.
NEW SEASON GOT!!!
EX-FRICKEN-CITED
Whats going to be the point if they just gona fuked up royally at the end?  NOT INTERESTED PASS!
Where dragons
Even though the writers fcked Dany's character and arc I am stilñ excited for this!!
Thank God they can't fuck this one up too cause the ending is already set out for them.
its gonna be worse than season 8.  Just wait and watch.
From the beginning, you know the end.
Special effects budget: $20,000,000 White hair-dye budget: unlimited
THE WAIT IS ALMOST OVER 😭
I mean honestly their is no point in watching this after what the writers did to Daenerys.
me: Man, f*ck Game of Thrones! also me: Damn this looks good though.
Okay HBO. You got me again, I'll watch this but prommise to all this holy that I will never watch another GoT ANYTHING from you again if you screw this up. if you again set up a brilliant story and then kick me in the balls... Its over
I hope this and GOT aren't 100% Canon but at least half canon. Fucking Bran as the king has me gagging still.
I see Matt Smith, I watch. Simple.
Aegon and has sisters without this series will flope
So i guess this way we can still say "watching thrones"
I'm looking forward to seeing a strong black lead character in this story for once
this is gonna be terrible like the last few seasons of GoT
Meh, Hollywood ruined GoT, this won't save it.
Does the narrators voice sound familiar to anyone? I feel like it sounds like someone from the original got
I'm still debating on investing my time into this since they fucked all of us with the last ones ending
aaaa
The hate culture of this comment section is sad. Comments have become toxic. All this bashing of got instead of focusing on the fun this series could be. Why must we always compare everything? And why must everyone feel the need to let it be know how much they hate GOT ending everything anything GOT related shows up, like an interview or whatever. Get over it people. Also people overreact. The final was fine. Rushed, but that was really it's only real problem. People just be salty.. or enjoying the easy likes by cashing in on the popular to hate on catagory. People worked hard on that show. People you supported for years, untill s8 and then you drop them all like bricks. Sad. This fanbase is toxic as hell. At least the vocal online part of it.
oh shit, here we go again
All Targaryens assemble here🔥
Nahhh...I was a huge fan but when they fucked the series i stoped being one.Dont watch it because they will do the same eventually
Still mad about Dani they better get this shows ending right ffs
a voz do narrador parece a do Ramsey Bolton
WE WANT ATLEAST MELISANDRE IN THAT SHOW...
It's so cool, but where is my Queen Daenerys Targaryen? 🥺
Ok but i need to know the end first
I can now honestly say… I’ve never been so unexcited for something in my whole life.
Blah.....
The end of GoT sucks
Woah what a trailer
Hopefully it won’t be a disappointment as GoT was.
Is that Doctor Who I see?
the fire is coming
You fucked up the last one and you felt the need to do it again? No thanks,  I'll pass
Winter Is Coming
It'll be all the bombastic empty bullshit of the last two seasons of Game of Thrones - you can already tell. Nah. Will watch the youtube compilations of fight scenes and cool explosions later and that's it.  Also, do I even need to say it? lol.
As hard as they screwed over their fans on GOT on that last season.  I'm not gonna waste my time.
At least whoever directing this have the books for script and not do same stupid mistake that dumb and dumber did by making up shit on their own the last season of game of thrones.
You guys ruined it for me after season 8. U done lost so much credit now! Which is probably why this trailer is getting no love. Reap what u sow
Can't wait for another trainwreck!
HBO will destroy this like they did  the original  series. Targaryens during the conquest-  we’re god like. Platinum hair, strong jaw lines, purple eye color, didn’t see anything impressive in the actors you cast including the “black” house of dragon members 👎🏻
Read G.R.R. Martins 'Fire and Blood' to understand why this may well be very good. Just keep D&D the fuck away from this and we can have a little hope.
It doesn't matter how awesome and epic the story of the Targaryen house is, we all know how stupidly ends...
About time way to listen to fans can’t wait
We want justice for JON SNOW 🐺 It was a disgraceful final
I really hope the end of this series won't disappoint me like game of thrones did....
Why bother watching though? We know how the story ends now so why would we get invested?
Would have been nice to get this out before ending got show.
That pussio  even looks like a “in-house product”
I have no plans on watching this, I am kinda over this since GoT but I see matt Smith I click. Y'all got me with the thumbnail

180 years before the Lannister family became inbreed.
Season 8 still hurts
Hopefully it starts early 2022, we  n e e d  it.
See the Video of Bill Gates Admitting Depopulation Plans:https://youtu.be/ZBACB00gCPQ
Its going to be amazing... and then, I suspect that the last two episodes will be delivered via Twitter.
I don’t know if I’m willing to watch this after I invested 7 years into GOT only to be so utterly disappointed with the finale 😒
BLACK VALERIAN. RLY????🤬🤬🤬😤
I threw up a little bit there....in my mouth. D7D destroyed the IP and this is just more crap.
Finally... Coldblooded kingship knows no kinship...
As long as D&D haven't had their grimy little hands on this, I will give it a chance.
Can't wait🥺🥺
An HBO??
Many more Asians, Indians and blacks now hhahahahahahahahahahahaahahah MUH DIVERSITY!!!
looks like I'll be streaming a LOT this fall
Game of thrones again😂😂
NO!
WE DON'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE even if you somehow managed do get the doctor to do it
I see Matt Smith & I click!!!!!!!! And that sounds reminded me do Doctor Who for a second ! also though.... I REALLY cannot get over how they ended that with BOTH OF THOSE CHARACTERS. To this day. All of that investment for what... for WHAT 😩😩😩😩
Is this related to "GOT"?
Meh, I'm more excited for the new Lord of the rings and Matrix resurrections.
Увесь світ чекає, я вважаю. Тож, давайте. Не підведіть. Хочу ще вісім років, кожен з яких буде ознаменований крутим серіалом.
Omg I’m so excited 😩💔 I definitely miss Dany so much. Emilia Clarke can body a Targaryen like no other but it’ll be exciting seeing her entire family before she was even born
better dont let this dragon act stopid
00:36 ohhh! Prince Philip look so weird with long hair. Wait. . Wrong tv show😂😂😂
Cannot wait for House of dragons finish the book already cannot wait for the series start
If you gona manage to tell a story and keep faithful to the story without fucking up the last season like you did with GOT OK , if this is another series to come to an end at the hands of a woke director or  script writing idiot , so keep it we do not need another farce !
Pra no final acabar com Daenerys morta daquele jeito e o banana de Jon vivo.
If Rhaenyra is 16 years younger than Daemon than why does she look older than him in this trailer?
Meh, seen it all before.  Nothing new here.
(please be good, please be good, please be good...)
I'm ready to get hurt again.
Nobody cares about another failed GOT. Worst ending in existence, yes, even worse than sequel disney wars.
It's too bad...I told myself I wouldn't give George RR Martin any more of my money or attention untll he finishes his fucking GoT books.  Guess I'll have have to wait until he dies and it gets Ghost-written before I watch this.
Can’t wait to watch another horrific ending!
One day I hope someone get enough money to by Game of Thrones franchise from HBO and do justice to the last series ending.
Want to see the twenty dragons that were promised!!! FIRE&BLOOD
Amazing!!!!
I see Little Finger's Valyrian dagger. Sneaky.

There is One truely God , no God but Him , stop spreading poisoned ideas.
Yeah Nah
NGL the Targaryen have some sense of fashion
W
HAHAHA YESSIR
After the lackluster Game of Thrones final I am not even excited for this and I bet a lot of people feel the same.   Following a series for years only for the ending to be rushed to all hell.
Burn to hell HBO. What a piece of trash Got ending had. Never more gonna watch anything from you. Waste your money trying.
LETS FUCKEN GOOOOOOO
Yassssssss betchhh
give me something for the pain and let me die
Hopefully it won't take two years between seasons.
was George RR part of the production team
When GoT looks like the Hunger Games: Mockingjay lol
At some time he is gonna be back in the Tardis
I’m not sure what era it is hope it’s before and shows more of Arthur dayne as the king body guard and fight the smiling knight
Not a fan of Matt Smith playing Daemon. I like him as an actor but I just can't see him pulling off a character described as a powerful dashing warrior.
انعم ايه 🔥
They really out here thinking we forgot how terrible the last show ended 😂 the prequel that Nobody asked for.
This is just one of the 11th Doctors side quests
Gonna get a lot of flack but Velaryons arnt black they all have very pale skin. Its tokenism and it doesnt fit! Its Just pandoring.
.... Or they could go back and give us the final season as it should have been.
Matt Smith was a terriable decision the only character he plays is yhe annoying person everyone hates!
Dreams didn't make us kings... Affirmative Action did...
Yeeesssss!!! Beautiful.
"Dreams didn't make us kings... protein did"
i cant wait to be disapointed with this show
When in 2022?  Is there a projected month/day?
Please HBO be smart with this, you’ve got a shot at redemption here
1 Thessalonians 5:20 King James Version 20 Despise not prophesyings.
Not spending another few years after what you did last time.
Yeahhh Amazing
Raat ki Baat- Bunny. Palang tod rap song. https://youtu.be/QbxeG1V52W0
Isn’t he the guy from doctor who?!
Here to dislike. Not watching this trash. Seasons 6-8 were absolute shit.
Cool. Now just have proper plan for how for how you tie up the story in the last season. Just winging it doesn't seem to go well.
الدمعة طاحت  قتلنا الشوق ❤ موعدنا 2022 إنشاء الله 💪💪
If there is lyanna Ned stark will be also there🌝
EXCITED TO WATCH THIS. Just don't ruin it like Game of Thrones, please.
Doesn’t matter how this show ends… in the end Bran still becomes king.
I nominate anyone but D&D to be showrunner. Seriously it's hard to care much given what happened to the main show. The Dance of the Dragons really doesn't seem as interesting as the War of the Five Kings story wise. The show was best when the focus was on characters, not CGI dragon fights. It doesn't bode too well for this dragon-heavy spinoff.
Looks good. But it would have been really interesting to see the targareyan era right from the start when aegon conquered westoros.
I don't want it
Thats not series, its art
Black Velaryon are super woke though.
🤯
Please don’t mess this up, this time.
It reminds me of that show  Game of Thrones.
the soundtrack in the intro in background made me tear up
Dr who guy
Season 8 #NeverForget
Are y'all ready to be let down by the final season because I am
Gonna last 1 season, everyone will forget about it.
That looks really...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...
North remember !
Finally we'll learn about the events that led to the mysterious coffee cup.
So now there's black targaryens? I literally fell out of my chair laughing. The tokenism is just absurd at this point.
Please let it be a spin off.
No dragon?!
Once you redo season 8 maybe
This looks dumb
Different story but same vibe 🖤 🔥
Don't give us hope...!!!
Doctor who ?
Is this is during the reign of the Mad King?
Came here from tiktok LOL
Malfoy grew up <3
Another pathetic spin-off
Will this series be sponsored by Starbucks as well?
That turd on video miniature pic looks like Witcher from china. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 definitely not going to watch it.
❤️❤️❤️
Imagine bran the builder was just seeing the future (Warging) in his time and that actually was, what we saw as "Game of thrones" oof...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UwEjxduHM0&lc=z22juliicqumd1thx04t1aokgpxby3hfdru2wrgth5sgrk0h00410
Don't worry, guys, I'm sure this will have a happy ending. The Doctor is here, after all... (smiles with tears in eyes)
Only watching this for Matt Smith. He deserves that much.
This is going to be woke trash.
I look forward to this series to see how much the creators of the series will change Martin's vision and adapt it to the communist correctness currently reigning in showbisnes
This just wet ma appetite
S8 of GOT Was Ruined by D&D, I hope this fails too. Waste of 8 years of my life and probably 10 years of the actors. Pathetic
I don’t believe to succes
Hard pass. Why don't you do a real final series finale before moving onto the next project?
Season 8 of this show will be fucking epic! EPIC I tell you!
Have you considered adding dinosaurs and a anti war theme to the show to make it better, like Star Wars?
Another GoT that’s just an all black screen. “Artistic intent” has to still be visible.
Why are valar valyrians black? Like you could have chosen any other race to have played by a black actor and you choose a family who's race is described as "having violet or blue eyes, sliver hair and being "VERY PALE."
I’m assuming those “black Targaryens” you see are actually Velaryons, another family that escaped the doom of Valyria. 0:39 Corlys Velaryon (long silver dreaded locks) was an expert of ships and his wife next to him Rhaenys Targaryen (midnight blue and gold gown) was also very intelligent. Everyone is disappointed from the last seasons but I’m very excited to see how their minds play a role in this era.   I’m also assuming that those mixed characters are their children, Laenor Velaryon  (short silver locks behind Corlys) & Laena Velaryon (shouldered dress/silver curl ringlets behind Rhaenys), also very intelligent folk in the books and dragon riders because of their Targaryen mother.
After messing up season 8 of GOT…No. Too much of a disappointment. Show me this at season 5…or even 7. I’d be super excited. Now, nothing.
This would had been amazing if we did not know how it will end 😑
Is that Ramzy's voice?
Probably better than season 8. On the other hand, anything is better than season 8.
Dear GOT Franchise ;; Even it's a  work near perfection , it can't change  the ruins  that this franchise left 2 years back .. It has kindaa made us look at any web series with a bit less enthusiasm just coz ,  ** It was the best show on the planet with worst possible end **
heck yeah!
I LOVE YOU HBO <3
the chillssss
I don't want it
They better not f*ck this one up
The principalities and powers of earth are in bitter revolt against the God of heaven. They are filled with hatred against all who serve Him, and soon, very soon, is to be fought the last great battle against good and evil. The earth is to be the battlefield—the scene of the final contest and the final victory. Here, where for so long Satan has led men against God, rebellion is to be forever suppressed.  Christ came to this earth in human form that He might stand as the Captain of our salvation, so that we should not be overcome by Satan’s power. And when the enemy has seemed to be gaining a signal victory over righteousness, God has been working in mercy and power to counteract his designs. Determined to efface the image of God in man, Satan works with an intensity of effort to hide God from view. Not openly does he work, but secretly, mingling the human and the divine, the spurious and the genuine, so seeking to bring confusion and distress. But in proportionate power divine mercy is revealed to counteract this wicked working and bring to light the enemy’s hidden purposes. ~Ellen G White  ~Letter 153 1901 par.12 Seek and ye shall find 🕯
I was skeptical until I saw the iron throne
Matt Smith! Hell yeah 🔥
I'll say something revolutional here. I'm gonna start watching it. If it's good then I continue. If not, I'll stop. My life won't change a bit with or without this series. Like with GOT. All these people who are still endlessly complaining on every video about this show or GOT need to get a life. And then it won't be ruined by some intertainment.
Dreams didn’t make us Kings, Dragons did!  I love that line😳🔥🐉
The fans remember
Finally 😌🔥🥺it's here
Remake Season 7 & 8 of GOT. We will pretend like we forgot what happened.
The story I wanna see is the thousand and one eyed green seer.. I wonder if that’s around this time
200 years before the fall of the best show ever.
Sounds like Ramsay
yeah i have 0 trust that this will be good after season 8 was complete dogshit
Tbh I don’t like Matt Smith. As soon as I saw he was playing in it I was instantly torn. Hope the show does good though. Who knows maybe he will die in the first season.
Please don't f*ckd up this too HBO... Stay with daddy George R.R Martin's directions
Can’t wait 🔥💯
Dislikes are from the GOT season 8 critics
Wow
https://youtube.com/shorts/2QWw3saVW8c?feature=share
Looking forward to this Hope the last season doesn't suck
Hbo lit th fire on hearts😲😲
People are actually excited for this boring shit? 😅
Can't fucking wait!!
I just hope it's not as bad as the last season of Game of Thrones.
Why did you guys do this to Matt Smith? Season 8 absolutely ruined this franchise, you’re not saving it.
Mientras que no caguen el final en esta también 😅
muito maneiro
I hope they won't ruin this too
Im excited for this but at the same time I have trust issues because of that horrible final season of GOT.
Nah, this will be trash. Hard pass.
Oh heeeeeell yeah. :D
I can already see it is heavy with political correctness and shit nobody wants to see... Keep the story good and people will watch, keep adhering to PC and only blue haired whales of twitter and tumblr will watch.... its your choice.
Love it
Everyone Will Have Sliver Hair When This Is Released
Mind officially blown 😮
Last season of GOT left me so scarred, that I shiver at the sight of HBO.
Hope to see Ned in this
The dragons? Ohhhh they’re coming
0:41 stark sigil
That Targaryen soundtrack from GoT makes me very happy
HOLY
I hope they dont fuck this up like GoT
_Eve Best_ 🥰🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Daaam im si exited
Throne looks like poo.
Doctor who as a Targaryan... hard...
oh nice...another diverse trash series. God i am so excited!!!!!
No. Does no one else remember the royally screwed up GoT?
Me: After the last season of GOT I’m done with it. Not gonna waste my time  Also me after watching the trailer : Hey big head
I am going to pretend that Game of thrones ended in a cliff hanger at season 6.
¿Qué sentido tiene acabar con juego de tronos para hacer una serie basada dn juego de tronos? Haber seguido haciendo temporadas, que menudo final de mierda nos habéis dado en la última temporada
Not  desperate cpr to revive the show's legacy after killing it yourselves
He stole Geralt of Rivias hairstyle and color D:
Matt u're our last hope.. wait..!? wrong franchise
finally 😍😍😍
and despite the apocalyptically shit game of thrones finale i will likely watch this. there you go, hbo calling my bluff and taking my money
When will be HBO max launch in India
No dragons?
초창기 타가리옌 얘기인가보네,.   출연진 다 갈아엎었,.
Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically. Run Matt Smith.
The fact that people are complaining about black people in house Velaryon even though it's perfectly possible, while nobody is talking about who they don't have purple eyes which is the most defining trait about the Valeryans shows how people only care about rambling their political agenda in everyone else face's
200 years before the fall of game of thrones lmao
I would be so excited if they haven't butchered GoT.
❤️⚡️
You (HBO) already ruined this universe. I’m still waiting for an apology for S8.
홀리싯
HBO killed GOT
Who really cares about what happened in the past after what happens in the future which is the end basically so watching this will be just like really irrelevant it should just do a story about Drogon Flying around for no reason or something
This show looks racist as hell.
I have a feeling they chose this spin off so they can rely on a bunch of expensive CGI and battle scenes instead of having a deep dialogue driven plot
Nice tip of the cap to Daenys the Dreamer at the end
So, horrible people behaving badly. Oh, how will it all end?
Not even a single "dracarys" to be heard. Still promising.
0:42 this shot captures what this story is all about
so are we going to have purple eyes this time?
Excited to watch little finger's ancestor middle finger
Wow 9 thousand dislikes to a teaser trailer because they’re still butthurt lmaoooo
Nah. I pass.
I was not satisfied with the last season of GOT previously ...I don't think it's worth watching its new series they will again do it for this one also
HBO max will to be with walt Disney company ever
First please give permission to INDIA. HBO MAX.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Is white walker back in this series
I'm waiting for people commenting here to George to finish up the damn books first! 🤣
I mean it looks okay.. I would prefer an Arya Stark spin-off..
The stench of the last season follows this show. I can’t say I care enough to watch it.
E
NO ME JODAN , COMO RECIÉN VEO ESTO, OPD , AÚN LLORO  POR DAENARYS
Narrated by the one and only   Ramsey Bolton
So does anyone know if this is going to be them establishing the 7 kingdoms or is the kingdoms already established and it’s a civil war?
It doesn't even matter that I lost more than 2 million euros in a few hours. This thriller made me forget all the bad things that have happened in the last two years and in these last hours. I can't wait for the premiere.
So excited for this 😍
Is this about Aegon I?
Most Funny 14 Seconds Video 😂😂 https://youtube.com/shorts/9Jio4GA_MGo?feature=share

Meh no, Witcher it is. Even before the first season of GOT.
BALERION THE DREADD🔥🔥🔥
Excited 🔥🔥🔥

*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
Nah you screwed GoT im not gonna watch this and be rick and rolled again
If David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are near this.. I want nothing from them!
Can't wait for this!
Incest is coming!
The production value and casting is amazing, lets hope the writing is too. I really hope they explain why Velaryon is black!? The family looks super cool but it´s odd to suddenly have black people in Westeros. If they want black people or Asian why not have nobles from YI TI and Sothoryos!
I hope to hear Ramin Djawadi's new masterpieces
HBO MAX are you Great channel
"Quick put a black dude into the show so we can silence the rabid woke mob"
Already 2 days and here I'm watching it once again and again.........
I'm calling it now, matt smith is going to win that emmy.
Could you please burn the original show runers on a spin off episode. Thanks
"Dreams didn't make us kings... Semen did"
No.....just no.
Can not wait baby
Can’t wait for this and Vikings Valhalla
They should ressurect Daenerys of GOT and plan a new ending please ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why do I feel like saying Wakanda Forever!
0:23 Imagine how badass King Viserys I was. Wielded Blackfyre and the only dragon he ever rode was Balerion the black dread
आप सभी को नवरात्रि की हार्दिक हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं ❤ 🚩🙏🔥
Mr. Martin promised that he will not put his nose on any TV series project, till he finishes the TWOW. He is the worst morale writer who writes good stories. He and his pals just squeezing as much money as they could. The trailer sucks, voice sucks, even the only uttered sentence stinks of commercialism. Never thought that, Martin will be this disrespectful towards his readers. So what, if he doesn't respect his readers!! Most probably, he not only lost his relationship with the readers but also the fire within himself. Most probably, the ending of his story will suck like the series, due to this reason. He sold a writer's soul to dollar squeezers 😔😔
Same crap like a got
This arc is completed in the book, eager to see how truly they adapt to it.
Instead of getting a good ending for an amazing show, we get a prequel to that show, that we already know how it ends.
Looks like my subscription will be back 😌
Nope. They couldn't get season 8 right then wtf is this?
Stop  0:18 did any one noticed balerion the black dread
No hope, sorry...
THEY’RE ALL ALIENS, MAN!!!!!!
hopefully ya'll don't fuck up with this like you did with the last season of GoT
More dead people .
black targaryens hahahaha
Finally Littlefinger can count all the 1000 swords on the Iron Throne.
Targaryens looked inbred as hell.
waiting for got...
Se bobear essa série vai terminar e o George Martin não vai finalizar os livros : (
АААА быстрее бы
Si a esta le dan un mal final, sacaré un dragón de la serie y con el que..re HBO
Ok I am excited now ....
"Dreams didn't make us kings", sounds a lot like a reference to Bran. Like this is going to mock Game of Thrones and make it look like child's play.
HOLY SHITTTT
Thank you Miguel Sapochnik
Comeon its not available in india...wtf
I know you look cool and intelligent if you say anything bad about GOT final season. But I enjoyed it a lot. Looking forward to this one. 😏

Look, I like the idea   But that throne looks like absolute shit….. please tell me they’re going to triple the effort they’ve put into this adaptation of the throne.  Height is fine, whatever. Quantity. Quantity is what you’re looking for.   More swords. A shitload more swords.
sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh💓💓
I mean they can only go up from here it can’t be worse than the last two GOT seasons…right?
I don't trust them anymore after last season
but we all know lanister killed all dragon in the end
black peaople? house targaryen? 😲
tenes..oportunidad..de..levantar....ese..final..malicimo..no..la.cages..
would be great other than the forced diversity. sucks that you have to focus on the race and not the story. could have done another show in the canonically black parts of asoiaf but instead we are shoehorning diversity. i expected better from you hbo.
My only gripe about this is we wont get to see Balerion alive since he already died of old age at the time this is taking place
Sooooo excited‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Take your time and start working on the final season and final episode now.
I am praying for GRR Martin's long life.

Why the fuck is Ramsey narrating.
0:47-  That's the goddamned Iron Throne!    That's the thousand blades of Aegon's conquered enemies!
I wish I was more excited but I just don’t know I mean we know how they ended Game of Thrones so is there a point to watch the beginning when the ending was so crappy I’ve been wrestling with us for a while and I don’t know they may put another dumb and dumber on the case to fuck up this one to
Here we go again.
taRumlüg  Programmierer der Master  K. I.      .        .        .
Let me guess, is it going to be about the House of Targeryans? Like the first Targeryan Aegon the Conqueror? That would be great.
Over it... the last rushed season play this show out
Wtf
чернокожие валирийцы ?! ахахахаха , спасибо, посмеялся вы не устали от этой  "толерантной" повесточки ?!
Dragons made them kings and prophecies and the obsession with them dethroned them.

lmao when i saw the thumbnail i thought it was a parody skit on some sketch show
They should either do the whole book, or a season or two on Dance of dragons. Just don't stretch it by adding 'original' stuff
I really hope they make one about the Blackfyre rebellion too.  And I REALLY hope that they don't let Dumb and Dumber touch any ASOIAF property ever again.
What the f*ck with Velaryon house?! Fucked up, Vilarions now black people with white dreadlocks?!!!!🤣👍🏽🔥 Scriptwriters, will someday learn to read, something other than a training manual of tolerance?!
As someone who had no clue about the story when GoT began but who now knows almost everything about about the Dance with Dragons and the Targaryen civil war, this is going to be a very interesting experience.
This is going to be BIG 🔥🖤
I hope HOD have a better end.. please not like GOT end
2022 let it be winter
I have watched it almost 20 times😂😂
At least the main characters really look like inbreeds
طرگاعه  بَــسّ لتبعروها بليزززز
Omg!!! So excited!!!😍😍😍
❤️Fan video❤️ https://youtu.be/IXESa9isyX8
I can't wait 😍
This look like season 8
what's the point ? why a prequel ? like nobody asked for this after season 8
Cant wait for this 🥲❤️
Doesn’t look good
Πωπωπω θα γαμηθει το σύμπαν μέχρι να βγει μας σηκώσατε την τρίχα γαμωωωω 🥵🥵🥵🥵
Remember HBO.... Go woke, go broke.
OK, BUT WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS?!??????????????????
Is it Rob stark voice?
Please don't suck! Please don't suck! Pleeeeeease don't suck!
"' I don't want it ! "   John Snow
I can´t wait for what is comming!
I don't feel any emotion of this.
Any1 else got goosebumps on their legs watching this trailer? :D
I just finished watching 6 seasons of the History Channel's ' Vikings ' & found it to be infinitely better than Game of Thrones, here's why -  - There is no 'sexpositioning' : I don't have to compulsorily watch intimate scenes to learn important plot details, the crucial plot points are explained through conversations & real emotions and intimate scenes are about intimacy between two characters.  - Characters have clearly defined motivations and goals which evolve overtime instead of things like ' I will stay in Mereen ( for no apparent reason ) '   - No abandoned plotlines & hundreds unfired chekov's guns - everything and every character has a beginning and an end.  - Actions have real consequences, the unexpected deaths are crucial to the plot and have long-lasting consequences on the story, they aren't just a means to an end for discarding characters out of the story and which are forgotten like Robb Stark.  - The large army battles actually use strategy instead of screaming dragons.  - ' My name is Bran, I'm a cripple and I cannot fight ' vs ' I am Ivar the Boneless !! '  - The supernatural element of the show is more related to fate, religion and spirituality instead of being a mute monster to defeat who leads a zombie army with ice powers.  - The story takes place over two generations, there is no need to cram everything into one tale.  And the list goes on and on.
My request of whole HBO MAX team that please provide this awesome series in hindi language in India 🇮🇳🙏
Wooowww I am so exited about it
I love Matt Smith….but yeah even he can’t save it
Apparently they're going to pay the writers this time
I don't want no stinking prequel, I want a sequel seeing bran's journey towards becoming professor x
Bull💩 destroyed whole series with last season of GOT this will not even save it..
It looks neat but honestly I don't expect much. Making a good trailer is really damn easy,making a good show less so.
I'm So excited.!🥺✨ Game of Thrones🌟
17 DRAGONS 🐉🐲
Any show with hystoric events either real or not happened:  Casting Directors: Let's cast Matt Smith!
I'm predicting this series to be a huge let down as soon as I saw "AN HBO ORIGINAL SERIES"
Please dub all season of Game of Thrones official in hindi
Season 8 slaughtered any hype I could have for this.
Dreams didn't make us Kings, incest did.
'An' HBO production?
Action, or fantasy didn't made GOT extraordinary, Drama did.
OHHMGGGGGG!!! I can not wait!!!!! Biggest GOT FAN HERE!!!! Please somebody leak it hahhahahaha (joking not joking) please just make a movie i dont wanna wait years and years for seasons to drop
Soundtrack by?
https://youtu.be/EIbdDXDHAqU
ALL OF MY BEING IS READY!!
I'm not starting any GoT spin offs until I hear that the writing doesn't completely suck and they end half way decent.
Remember one of the showrunners is the asshole that directed episode 3 of season 8 of GoT, you know the one where you needed nightvision to see the battle.
dreams don't make you king, only having a better story than bran the broken does.
Bran watched it already.
I don't quite like the casting...its not bad but it doesn't seem like it fits
So what hase our 11th Doctor planned this time?
"An HBO original series" is our children learning?
When he was speaking he forgot to label the tits. That's what made the last series, wasn't it? Tits and Dragons: The Prequel!   And yes, I know they toned it down in later seasons, and look where that got the series; rushed out the door. I just like making fun of super fans of this show. It was good. It wasn't earth-shatteringly fucking great like all the dudes cumming in their pants over it claim it to be though. Now, where the coin jar where I drop my 2 cents?
matt smith now has long white hair but still no eyebrows
ok grrm but why
Sooo cooool guys,  can't wait to watch 👍
Story seems promising but I doubt it''ll surpass that of Bran the Broken's. To be fair, who has a better story than him?
dont put polished faces in ancient fantasy stories...
Ok so… do we have naked people as well? I mean should be a pattern 😏
I just hope they don’t skip the 5 good seasons before going full sjw
But is this story better than Bran’s the Broken?
As long as beniof and Weiss stay away this could be good.
When will the Martin Luther movie be released? And he will be played by a white actor
season 8 was so bad it killed all my desire to watch this
0:50 why the throne looks so different?
Them: "Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did" Also them: have a war that kills the dragons
Where can I watch this series, please?
I'm so sick of freaking prequels.
I wouldn't watch this but that's just me.
Revelation 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.   ***Warning***  Your entertainment is far more than just something to keep you occupied, you are being programmed to desire the deception that is soon to overtake the entire world.   For a world that loves to deny that the bible is true, loves to deny Gods existence, and loves to mock and slander the name of Jesus...  They sure do love to use biblical narratives and scriptures in their entertainment.
Love the the Targaryens theme at the end there 🔥🐲
I can’t wait for this!!!!!
8.6 million views and 250k likes in two days? The critics keep telling no one cares about GOT anymore. 😂
I'm gonna mad
please remake season 8 got
https://youtube.com/channel/UCoNQ-wvQJ4TuxanSPt7cxKA Updates of Asianet serials
bruh,is that the voice of Ramsay?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why are most of the actor and actress look old as f-k in this one. Unlike Game of Thrones a mix of young and old cast.
Yeah sadly not hyped for this at all after the mess of what season 8 was.
I LOVE THIS SERIES LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Prequel sequels spin off whatever man just keep bring me that.
I feel bad for everyone involved in the last season of game of Thrones. Can't wait
Looks incredible. At least it's not directed by Dumb & Dumber.
Hope it's not gonna be shit like the last one...
I think I’m good.  Ima stick with the books.
The fact that the dragon's tail in the logo has the number 666 is all the evidence needed that this is satanic. I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever, Jesus Christ is KING.
Never watched a minute of the final season, but I’m afraid this ome is never goimg to be near as good as the original was. If not HBO itself, then the mandatory ethnic minoroty representation quotas and the LBTQvdjfoenebxh… will have to ruin this one to.
don't know why im here haven't event watched GOT 😂😂 (but this good)
Pu***s cant wait to watch it
Did anyone else catch the change in the Targaryen crest? The four legged dragon?
Is no one gonna talk about the ancestral targaryen sword Blackfyre... Can't wait to see darksister
A moment of silence for all the actors' hair damaged from bleaching
HBO hoping Matt smith will give people hope it'll be awesome. Iunno.... he'd need to be some kind of genius alien doctor!
Please stop mentioning the last season of got. This one has nothing to do with it it is a new generation
What is the point of watching this if one hated how the main show ended?
Send the raven 😉
Hoping this won't be as bad as the last two seasons of the show. Teaser doesn't look very hopeful tbh...
Y'all gonna ruin the ending of this one too?
Dreams didn’t make us kings dragons did  Le Bran: Hold my Raven
My teacher forced me to watch this trailer. Totally worth it :D
I recently watched whole GOT from season 1 to 8 in 10-15 days this September, the ending was very poor, i must say, the queen who freed slaves burnt whole city with people and children in it, it was stupid stuff, can anyone tell me why didn't dracus burn Jon snow at the end and only burnt iron throne
https://youtu.be/fbjuuaJQat0
People talking about how the story is "wrapped up". There is no dialogue in the book. It is an outline of events. There's no guarantee they will do it well. However, I will remain optimistic. Think they realise that if they don't rush it the show will remain extremely popular.
You seriously think I'm going to watch this after the absmyal ending of game of thrones? Haha.
D &D are they involved?
From knowing the Books on this event...this can turn out really good honestly. I'm a little excited 👌
❤️❤️❤️
Ugh, get it away. Not another bad GoT series. We all know how shitty it all ends, why go through it again.
So awesome. I can’t wait!! 😁
yoo
,k,.
Are we going to see Aegon's conquest in this??? 🙄🙄🥺🥺
Another series based on an unfinished book series. What could go wrong?
Irani
I love daemon targaryen
I bet this will be heavily infected by the disease of wokeness .
i have no faith and no excitement for any of this good job D&D
this show will be good COPIUM
House Of The Dragon😉
0:23 It's that the Blackfyre sword?
Dont know what it is but something tells me this shows gon be shit.. hope m absolutely wrong.
House Of the Dragon is coming to HBO max in2022
OMG OMG OMG can't wait
Hee looks like Draco frm Harry Potter.!
PLEASE RELEASES HBO MAX IN INDIA
Ramin Djawadi is again the composer, isn't he?
"Before the fall of the throne." They got that right!🤣
200 years? I thought it was 300?
I'll just pretend Game of Thrones never happened so I can give this a real shot. Lol
💯
As long as DnD are kept as far away from this as possible, it should be amazing
What is dead may never die my a$$ GoT Died back then in Season 5.
Is it Ramsay Bolton narrating?
Dragon it's real but I hope this movie it's best
It looks cheaply made.
0:38 O look the diversity hire.
Next please add a white skinned tribe with dark hair to wakanda please…idiots
Бред. Толерастический бред
This is got return dragon
let's fall in love again and once again be disappointed.
Hope the CGI team is ready for this.. the amount of dragons the show will have
When will launch HBO MAX in India??
Boring
Bran -: Dreams didn't make me king, ser jamie did.

What donyou get when you mix Matt Smith and William Hartnell together 😂
Ok, so who's the black guy? I thought all the targarian are white and blonde cuz they marry each other to keep the blood pure 🤔
That dagger look familiar? Hahahaha
ഇത് ഒരുമാതിരി പൂരം കഴിഞ്ഞിട്ട് വെടി പൊട്ടിക്കുന്ന പോലെ യുണ്ട്  ക്ലൈമാക്സും കയിഞ്ഞ് നടിയും മരിച്ച ശേഷമാണോ തുടക്കം കാണിക്കുന്നത്

wow i'm so hyped for this.
Waiting 🔥❤️
Fool me once...
https://youtu.be/1L2CUfpAbCE
Please dont do anything like u did with GOT in s8
Was not expecting this...... A prequel!!!
I hope they already have an ending written and don't end up winging it like last time!
Is there going to be a season 8?! 🙃
Let's hope HBO does not wreck this like games of thrones
Really hope the directors don't rush this, looks amazing.
I've never know a franchise to die so fucking hard after what those fuckwits did to seasons 7 and 8.
after last seasons of GoT (holywood style) not really interesting
Most of me is wondering why does this series matter anymore. We know how the targeryan lineage ends. Westero-nazi Danaerys and her whipping boy "Muh queen" Jon Snow.
looking forward to that final post credit scene that reveals dany has been revived by the red witch ......     i can dream
This is so exciting! They even revamped the throne to have it bear more resemblance to the TOWER of swords in the books! The story is wrapped up and hence won't give us another season 8. This is very, v e r y exciting!
https://youtu.be/8en3WZwOqV8
The targaryen look like inbreds, oh wait.
And that’s more of the throne I was looking for.
Yooo this looks gooooooooooooooood.
DOA dog shit
o kurdew wiedzmin
Spotted the Tardis
I look forward to the soundtrack

Its not just targaryens The starks the lannastiers have to be back
Bro, fucking Dr. Who had enough of those wonky ass looking GB villains who look like they had a 5 buck budget
HBO still butthurt that the two idiots threw the GOT ending for a star wars trilogy that was never made because GOT was shit lmao
Epic 😱
“Madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.”  This will be a bit long. I'm one who loved the unpredictable and unsafe nature of GOT. I wasn't "rooting" for anyone to win the Throne, that's not what the whole series is truly about. I hate how it's hip to hate on the show now from casual TV show viewers who need a certain ending or typical cliché storybook shit. GOT wasn't afraid to go against the grain, plot armor cast aside, and your favorites could end up in a shitty places doing shitty things.  Looking at the like/dislike ratio lets me know fans can get passed the ending of GOT and how it didn't fit their ideas. GOT showed that it was an unforgiving show that mirrored life and that cookie cutter endings in Dark Fantasy aren't like LOTR. The only other material that I know that's just as unforgiving is the Soulsborne games. These books and tv shows are for fans of those kinda of dark/depressing themes. So forget your cookie cutter hero/heroine riding a dragon into the sunset having defeated all the evils of Westeros.   I also think too many people attached themselves to Daenerys, Jon, and other characters. Naming their kids after her, or getting tattoos of her sayings and all kings of things. They wanted that character to stand for something in our world and our times, when this is a dark fantasy world of truly ugly and mad people. Never go into a show like GOT expecting a normal story arc or attach yourself to anyone. Just enjoy the journey and applaud the fact they didn't end the series like Lost, going for emotions instead of consequential arcs.   If the show runners or writers ever come across this comment I appreciate what you did and even though it didn't go how I expected I respect you didn't just cave in and do the same fantasy tropes we've experienced so many times.
Wait Doctor who is now a Dragon King
Heck yes! Me and my dragon tattoo are ready!
Seasons 7and 8  of thrones were really one season. They decided to chop it in half and spread it out over time. By over a year and a half apart. This is where the showrunners failed. All that time and people bitch that season 8 feels rushed. However, when you watch 7 and 8 back to back as like one season it isn't as bad as those who make it out to be. The show garnered a massive audience so no matter what not everything was going to satisfy all. For me bran being the one in the end just simply didn't work and felt kind of tacked on. That and cersei's end was not satisfying. Either danearys should have killed her by having her dragon eat her, or have Sansa kill her. Those would have made more sense because both had all the motive in the world to end cersei. Jon snow was ok end albeit kind of anti climatic but still ok. Sansa and arrya had the best arcs of the whole show imo. As for Daenerys "suddenly"turning crazy um did noone watch the first few seasons? She killed, made a bargain to get her husband saved from death which backfired, killed many people. And towards the end kept on with the bend the knee to me power trip. So her madness was more of an obsession than anything.  And anything to accomplish her goal of getting that throne. My favorite moment of the whole show is when drago melts the throne. I thought it was powerful and was the true end for that part of the throne saga. Now we can see what happens when the Targaryen reigned and perhaps all the way to their eventual downfall.
Since the fandom has been revived here I'm just gonna mention that it's been confirmed by GRRM that Bran will sit on the Iron Throne by the end of ASOIAF books, D&D had the right conclusion but the execution leading up to it was rushed and lackluster, but it is what it is. Not that unbelievable in hindsight since the first chapter of the first book is from Bran's POV so the last chapter of the final book will most likely be about him as well - also we should remember that the Targaryens ruled Westeros but the Starks were the FIRST and most ancient house and were already kings of Winter for 8,000 years before the Targaryens even set foot on Westeros land and proclaimed themselves as the official rulers who united Westeros for 300 years. In a way it's poetic how it all comes back full circle. Ever wonder why the final book's initial title was "A Time for Wolves?"
I can’t wait. Holy crap it’s been too long.
Dreams didn't make me a king.....a fall did - Bran
Thank you to everyone who made This!
On no, what's the doctor doing in that universe!?
fuck yes, something to live for
🔥🔥🔥
I am the only one who is waiting for opening credits of this series 🤣😂
Please don't make this shit like GOT S8
What's the date for 2022 so I could avail a subscription. 😂
I bet they can't see boats on the open sea either.
Let's be real it's never going to be as good as GoT. Let's expect a GoT season 8 level of good, lol
Dreams did not make us king dragons did....🔥🔥🐲🐲
Excited
Anyone from india?
GOT was such a crazy time at its peak can’t believe how hard it fell off no one was talking about it after that last season sheesh
Wow this brought me back in, love game of thrones
ASOIF should be pissed George is working on this instead of finishing the books.
QUE PESADEZ CON JUEGO DE TRONOS. QUE PUTA PESADEZ!
Wow they deleted  my comment...
after the last 3 seasons of GOT... why would anyone have high hopes for this?
Who is ummm....the director of this show?
I am guessing Hbo really made blackfyres black huh, thats just dumb af
Another one like GOT  Who spoil all the relations of family
@ 00:31 I can't see anything happening in this painful eye straining dark scene. Has GOT learned nothing? It's like they are doubling down on dark muddy scenes where you can't see anything.
I miss my Khaleesi
Please re make season 7 and 8

After watching last season of game of thrones, I realized that i wasted 4201 minutes of my life. 🥔🥔🥔🥔
Can't wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just finished watching season 1...
This is nearly exact to what a pitched to my friends for the new spin off. I honestly think story telling wise this was the best move for Game of Thrones. Just don't fuck it up HBO
🙏😭🙏🏻 Your one click can change my whole life🙏😭❤️
Shame 🔔 , Shame 🔔……..
The north remembers D and D's betrayal
Why is his dreadlocks made of yarn…. I have so many questions concerning this. HBO is too big of a network not to be able to get their black actors proper hair stylist 😑
Yo Prince philip, this is the wrong prince in wrong universe.
The Game of thrones series ending was not good, It wasn't even fine.😥😥 But this is giving me hypes. 🔥🔥
If we had this throne design in GOT we wouldnt have those awesome scenes with Varys and Littlefinger
she's MQWEEN
Lets go baby!
A man sees HOUSE OF DRAGON A man clicks
I honestly cba to watch this after how badly they butchered GoT. Not worth getting invested in it again
Team Black, who's with me? :D
They said the fall of thrones but it should have been fall of whole series
as long as you have competent writers and Dumb and dumber stay as far away from this one
Who else did not expect to see the 11th Doctor in the thumbnail?
Hope D&D is not involved with this show. Cause theyre going to fak it all up again.
I pray this one has a better ending 🤨
Fff
Dracaris modha fukas 😂🔥❤️

Matt Smiiiiiiiiiittttttthhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! I love this man. I was already in, but even more now to see his chops help carry another series. And to clarify, I am specifically referencing "The Crown". :)
Will this be about the Dance of the Dragons?
I will just try to forget the shitty conclusion of the original.
Зачем там негры?

Ohh child ohh child I'm ready
I like dragons; after ravens they are my favourite creatures.
卧槽  太期待了！！！！📌
I'm only excited for Mr.Djawadi .
I am so exited about this series.
Finally we are getting it, here makers also have an opportunity to redeem themselves for messing up the last season of GOT incorrigibly. Hope they don't make the same mistake again of ruining a show which could have been the greatest spectacle on TV!
I want more
Then came jamie fookin lannister
Am I the only one who is not excited because of GoT's finale sucked so bad? 🤔
Shit teaser, hope show will be better
Finally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why does anyone give a flying sh*t about this when HBO chose to rush Game of Thrones and loaded the last two seasons with terrible writing? 🤨 It's all for nothing if you don't stick the landing!!
🤯
The weapons look SICK!!!
Please please do it right this time!!! Don’t let it be a let down like the last 2 seasons of GOT
Why Ramsay Bolton is narrating this ??
They should have led with dragons. Boring teaser...
Is it me or it really sucks🙄🙄🙄🙄
I'd rather watch Dunk and Egg.
I wasn’t gonna watch, but seeing Matt Smith. Now it obligatory
Took you so many time i dont see talented actors nor a fascinating trailer that could make us believe its not another season 7 ,8 of the thrones

Are you f&₽&&n serous ? Afrotargarien ?
It will be better if you release it in Hindi.
негры стали белыми !?
They must use magic to bleach their hair.
With how they screwed the end of GoT everyone should skip watching this and let them waste the money making it. They ignored the book and changed what they wanted when they felt like it. You really feel like falling for it again?
If it’s about the Targaryen family , would it be about incest?
I'm what for this web
Theme song of game of thrones😍
I'm from Indonesia  So excited to watch this 😇
왕겜 리메이크나 하지ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
😭It is The Doctor.
There’s no way they can ruin this one right he fucking finish writing this one right?!
I don't know how to feel about this. My heart shattered from the red wedding and held out for the unsatisfying final season of GOT.
They are making money from the Targaryen only to kill them in the game of thrones haha
❤️India 🇮🇳
MATT SMITH???
I dropped it in episode 1...not my type
HBO please hindi dubbed
The ending of this spinoff will be that of Bran in a chair envisioning it all 😂
Another soap opera with dragons sprinkled here and there.
Hopefully it’s better than that shambles of an ending in the main series. As long as D&D are miles away and have nothing to do with it I’m sure it’ll be fine.
⚡
This show will be a hit no matter what.
00:41 Is that the Valyrian steel dagger Cat’s Paw she’s holding?

Please don't make the same mistake :)🙏🙏🙏

Just remember to not screw the ending up alright guys. Please I can’t take another disappointed like last time.
waiting for the dragons to hatch
Don't fuck up 👍
dear HBO,  Please don't fuck up this series like you did with season 5-8 of GOT.
F#%* This show they lost me at the last season

After what you guys did to GOT...Nope..not gonna watch it..sorry I'll pass.
Bunu. Konusu ne anlamadım ama game of thrones öncesi gibi geldi demir taht ejderhalar
I'm hoping this is quality content not just some made up stuff like the original TV series ended up to be.
PEOPLE LISTEN, George was not with the production of Game of Thrones for the last 3 seasons, and he regretted it somewhat. He himself said he will be engaged throughout this series. SO it have my hopes high
Shitty show...wont be watching this crap.
Abhi maza aye ga na bidu 🤣
HBO backpedaling so hard on the iron throne.
They finally got the eye color right. i hope this series makes amends for the sh*tshow that was season 8. i am really excited.
Yes give me the targaryen backstory because they did an amazing job with daenerys
I hope to see Jaime Lanister and Crazy King!
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG ONG OMGC LOJTFOMYBM OMG OMGOMGOMG!!
OMG
Yeahh boii.. Let's the fire begin 🔥🔥🔥
Should’ve made the Velaryons Asian and add Asian influence to their house’s culture.
No...Just...NO!!! None of this matters. Can't even go back and rewatch any of GOT. Let it Die...like the Dragons.    Note: The Iron Throne looks a little bit more like it does in the novels.
Narrator sounds like Robb Stark
yea. until season 8
Disappointed 11th doctor in this series . Because now I have to atleast watch one episode.  Otherwise they destroyed the replay ability of G.o.T. how can any of us watch it again nothing how disturbing that ending was not in regards to the acting. But the writing smh horrible horrible. We need that ending redone before moving on
Holy!!! I'm waiting for this
Just a other woke garbage
we wuz targaryenz and shieeet
0:33 Tell me he don’t look like a white walker
Nice
I just want HBO to redo the original right from the stannis losing the war and make him win it instead. Edit: No wait it was actually from the sparrow where the show started to go downhill. Harpy and sparrow ! damn even cults that are fictional can ruin things.

Omgggg I'm so excited 😍
But I want to see dragon Queen
Well I’ll tune in if you guys will
Can’t wait to watch this sooo hyped
Excitement at its peak✌️
In the end it's bran the broken. 😓😓😓 Bran the broken had broken this series, sequel prequel or whatever, a really long time ago
I can't do this again.. I will wait the 5-8 years it will take for this show to end. If the finale isn't fucked like GoT, I'll binge the whole thing in a month. Otherwise, I'll save myself the pain and time
So we’re all gonna go back to this abusive relationship? 😂
I desperately need Hugh Grants voice clip from the movie: “Music and Lyrics” saying: “I don’t trust you” to the creators.
"Dreams didn't make us Kings, Dragons did"!!!
Hope they don’t mess it up this time!
Ну хрен его знает, прийдется очень постараться чтоб это было интересно смотреть. Трейлер доверия пока что не вызывает, когбудто Роксолана какая то.
Matt Smith is in everything recently.
🔥🔥

So is it safe to presume there will be zero dragons considering they were all dead at this point, right? Like i clearly remember multiple characters in the show saying dragons we're a myth because they we're dead for so long while this is set only 200 years prior? I like dragons
Paying the inclusion quota LMAO.
Yes more drags
Matt smith is always a win
Getting chills right now
Please, don't ruin it with inclusivity and sjw things
Ok!  I did a little re-search on my Google search page, apparently this guy in  white or blond hair is Prince  'Daemon Targaryen and He's the bloodline of his descendant of Great, Great Great, Grandchildren of Prince Rhaegar,  Viserys & Daenerys Targaryen's.  So Prince Daemon Targaryen will have  a Son name 'Maekar Targaryen, and Maekar Targaryen 1st will has  his own Son call 'Aegon Targaryen 5th better known in Tails 'Dunk and Egg who will be call 'Egg but he might become a King on thone to in these series late series of 'House Of Dragons,  Anyhow, Eggo who's real name to  is Aegon 5th Targaryen's  will have his Son call 'Aerys Targaryen 2nd, better known as The Mad 'King..👑 who basically is Prince Rhaegar, Viserys, and Daenerys Targaryen's Father, and Jon Snow Grandfather and Jon Snow birth Daddy is Prince 'Rhaegar Targaryen as Daenerys oldest brother, which makes her as Jon Snow Aunt,  Jon Snow real birth name is Aegon Targaryen 6th or 7th..🥰👑
After the awful ending of got I'm done with these shows ✔
Winter is coming
Хаха опять негры в средневековье 🤣🤣🤣
Dear God please tell me Dan and Dave had nothing to do with the writing of this series.
Hopefully the ending of this series won’t be so stupid
people who aren't excited for this and thinks legacy of GOT died with season 8 are the biggest idiots in this world
What should I watch before this? I am just a beginner🤔🤔
Wow
Ab aayega madking
will this be a movie or a series?
I wish they were making multiple seasons where every season would have different characters and show a different era of Targaryen reign. I honestly thought I had heard this show was about something completely different and was supposed to be about old Valyria, that must have just been a rumor. Wish they would have started with Aegon and then shown the Dance of Dragons in the 2nd season and finally the Blackfyre Rebellion in the 3rd
wooohooooo
*Im going to watch every single episode of this, then skip the last season.*
Childhood days 😍❤️ HBO channel TFT colour TV Pogo CN  Harry potter
SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!
:0
Honestly I'm dying to see the reign of targaerians in the earlys but what happened to shitty season 8 I'm so not wnna go back and get disappointed again 😔
I just hope that they will make one more series after this that will take us to that moment where Jamie killed the king 😗
Try not to get too attached to any of the main characters. They’ll all be dead by the series finale. Lol
Como no tienes uno brasileiro aqui?????
Oh  my god,  isso é  ybirifouw
Don't hit me with that "200 years before the fall of the throne" bullshit. That shits non-canon
NO PUEDO MASSSS
I'm good.
Get hyped stay hyped let's go back to westeros
Long time waiting⏳ love you 😘😘🥰🥰🥰
🔥🔥🔥
The chick who plays rheanyra isn't pretty enough to be called the realms delight
I HATE THE CAST ... lets cast the most ulgy ppl we can find ?
why targarien is black wtf ? whats wrong with your mind hollywood
House Targaryen, welcome back. We missed you.
O my God😱
If this doesnt end with the last 10 seconds of the last episode with Daenerys opening her eyes inside the pyramids of Meereen then what is this forrr?
what the fuск
Make sure you push the twat directors and writers into NOT REPEATING what they did in season 6 of GOT  Thank you
Cast looks horrible. I don't watch "diverse" shit.
Oh hey Matt Smith
Cgi looks dreadful
Robert’s Rebellion starting with Ned and Robert chillin in the Vale plz
The thing about prequel is, we know who dies 😂
Death walkers?
Knowing how it all ended ( in the worst way possible) does the prequel matter anymore?
This looks incredible, to be honest.
esta vaina es como el señor de los anillos xd
Dont overhype this, HBO...quality is always better than quantity...if the storytelling and the dialouge sucks, the CGI's aren't going to save the show...
fu HBO, after what you did to Game of Thrones I'm not watching anything from you
I can’t wait to be bored by this
D&D : Hey HBO, what's going on ? HBO : NOTHING
is that white hair dude matt smith????
Who else got goosebumps?
Lol we wuz are here
“AN” HBO Series. Not a great start
I'm here 👑
where's Aegon II? not yet huh? Young Rhaenyra is cast. so Aegon doesn't appear yet
Why is Doctor Who cosplaying as Geralt?
I'm so excited.  I believe this series is going exceed all expectation.
Who is still waiting
https://youtube.com/shorts/PlI6obo07OI?feature=share😊😇
Finally♥️
Good final?
M amped ...I love dragons
I don’t think anyone realizes how much is GOT fans needed this. After the unsatisfying end to the show it feels sooooooo goooood to finally get our fix again.
Это до или после ИП ?
Damn. There will be a lot of dragon dancing to be done!!      Also, Also, the Velaryon family looks so damn gorgeous!!
Emilia_Clarke😍😍😍
“Madness and greatness were two sides of the same coin and every time a new Targaryen was born, the gods would toss the coin in the air and the world would hold its breath to see how it would land”
The last season of game of thrones was so bad that nothing can redeem them
Bring back HBO’s Rome.
The throne looks more like the one in the books.
Fire and Blood!
https://youtu.be/tE1w9ohPmSQ
Really house of the dragon is comming to HBO max in 2022
Will this be butchered like the last 2 seasons of GoT? My level of interest is moderate at best. I assume this will be a done-on-the-cheap version with poorly written scripts and virtue signalling throughout. Hope I am wrong, but if they can scrounge up good writers for this effort why couldn't they get them for the last 2 seasons of GoT?
😭that readom person who like my comment may you and your parents live more than 10years 😭😭😭
Meh
Why not make a story about the white walkers!!!
The most unbelievable thing in this show is Matt Smiths hair. I think I’d believe dragons are real before I’d concede he was a natural blonde. It’s like he went to Comic-Con dressed as Legolas.
Where is house stark😑
Does anyone else's ballz tingle whenever a Doctor Who actor appears in anything else?
POWER FROM KERALA
Im so excited, but if are 9 season , i  wait  9 years🥱🥱
Netflix's "The Witcher" What We Know So Far #netflix #thewitcher https://youtu.be/M7wX_Kf1Mfo
Need Hindi dubbed
Its game of thrones and it’s only $9 dollar a month😂
The king shits and the hand wipes
After the Battle for Winterfell, I don't expect anything more from GoT. For me, this saga is dead.
Let's go!!!!
Why there is a black gay in targaryens family? It’s stupid idea!
We also want GOT season 8 sequel
Afro Vellarions ruined everything. What a miscast face is a palm. As Stanislavsky said, I don’t believe. For those who have read books, the choice seems completely inappropriate ..
If this show ends with Bran telling the story, but then Daenerys shows up riding Drogon and says "What's good?", I may forgive GoT.
Yaaaaaawn
I’m beyond excited for this
Nah, after how you ended GoT, I'm not touching anything related unless is a reshoot of the last season. It's dead to me. It just makes mad every time I'm reminded how you destroyed one of the best shows ever created.
I'm still not ok with what they did to our Khalessi so this feels bittersweet 😏💔
🔥🔥🔥
Attack on Titan Ends and This Begins in 2022 😶
Dope
Dreams didn't make us king. Dragons did.🔥⚠️
You mean... The House of York.
Dracarys 🐲
Meh, did you get someone to write an ending? Why are the Targaryens less attractive? Will this be as bad as Watchmen? Or will it be like Game of Thrones and have a few good seasons and deteriorate into something worse like the wokety woke nonsense that Westworld became? Is George RR not Tolkien ever going to finish his original series(of course this is a rhetorical question)? Is this trailer the best enticement you had to offer? Do you need a production consultant that can help you sell products? How do you go from Wonder Woman to Blunder Women? If I was on the board of directors at T (that’s AT&T to you non investor types) these are the questions I would ask. Now for the happy note: Good job on The Snider Cut, and King Kong vs Godzilla, see it ain’t rocket science.
Remake season 8 of G.O.T first 😒 I'll pass.
Prequels have a bad trasck record
i love the hbo platform, always improving
So excited 😍😍😍
Oh boy, I can’t wait to be utterly disappointed by this.
If the shite writers/directors of the last two season of GoT are involved in this, I'm actively boycotting it. Fk those guys until the end of time. Literally ruined my entire perception of a show that could have been added to the greats (LotR, HP, Breaking Bad, etc.), but instead lost all credibility.
I am still keeping my expectations low cause I don't wanna be disappointed again ☹️
Game of thrones : house of the dragon & the lord of the rings : amazon prime 2022 will be very exciting year 😍
Nope. I'm not watching one more minute of GOT-based entertainment until Lord Roley-Poley finishes the next book.
https://youtu.be/DoA-a-g2o4g https://youtu.be/DoA-a-g2o4g
Here for day 1 of my commitment to watching this every day till it releases!!!
why is there a synth
Ahh shit, here we go again.
This better include Prince Daemon jumping from Caraxes to Vhagar and stabbing Prince Aemond in the eye with *Dark Sister* - MID FLIGHT!    Otherwise, we riot!
meh
well at least D&D can't ruin this one
Waiting 🙌🏻🙌🏻🔥🔥
Please don't be woke
Dont let dumb & dumber do anything in this show and it will be great
I’m personally a bit worried of how the show is going to end, specifically series finale wise. I mean we all know how the show ended, and that’s mostly because of D&D’s arrogance. So what do GOT fans think, do you it’s gonna be a success or a dumpster fire like how the show ended?
You guys already planning on ruining the ending again?
Cant wait any more
Are those two Douchebag showrunners out? Don't want them ruining the new series too cuz they want out but too selfish to pass the baton.
Let's see how many Indians watched this video 🇮🇳🇮🇳😉
Powershhh🤩💥
https://youtu.be/aORbHvMy5pQ
Remake season 8
Like many others I’m sure, I was not satisfied at all with the final season of GoT. I could go into details why that is, but chances are that you’ve heard it all from countless others. I am excited for House of the Dragons though, because even though the last season was pretty bad, I do still love the show and am so happy that we’ll get to see more of Westeros and see the rise of the Targaryen dynasty. Can’t wait to see it!
I may just watch this show just for Matt Smith
Jaehaerys the goat. Not sure if he’ll be in this season but I’m just throwing that out there 🤷🏽‍♂️
If they mess this one up, I will be done
I have been following this for months! Literally was just reading the cast list and character descriptions last week to a co-worker & now there’s a trailer! can’t wait
All I can smell is milk. But I hope it's good enough to enjoy.
Nah
New BB ki vines https://youtu.be/RDBHRMhd3PU
Ojalá que no la caguen como la última temporada de GOT
top de mas mlk
I was kind of hoping this show would take us through the 7 kingdoms being conquered and turned into the 7 kingdoms but from what it seems it looks like this will take place after that which is a bit of a bummer
Loving the more accurate depiction of the Iron Throne, even if it still cant be meters high. Looks promising, here's hoping...
Can't wait.
Amazing !
This show will probably be over before George finishes the books.
I would like to see some Dragon Teeth here🔥🔥🔥
please dont fuck this up like the last season of got.
Looks good, but after that last season they don't get me back.
Damn, the doctor sure aged
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
Spoiler...200 years later Bran become the king.
GOT fans 🔥
Good. Now resurrect Daenerys
After season 8 i can’t help think that it’s going to be another shit storm
,👍👍👏👏👏
HBO, me pregunto si en esta serie harán lo mismo que en la anterior, emocionarnos, darnos un buen desarrollo y al final darle a la gente el final mas horrendo y cucho del mundo, porque no en lugar de invertir tantisimo tiempo y recursos en esto mejor  arreglan esa cosa horrible de final que hicieron con juego de tronos que es lo minimo que merece el público al que desilusionaron?
Eso se ve bastante bueno, no me decepcione tio HBO jajaja
Frankly I have no further interest in HBO Game of Thrones series after how they handled the last one.
My Mind and Soul is ready!!! Finally!!!!
Am crying right now this is a relief
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
Yup, no. I'll pass.
great video
Hope they don't f*ck up the ending this time.
I can't wait to NOT watch this.  Not falling for it again.  BURN THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!
this bout to pop / where can i buy me a live dragon ..hehee
Happy new year💯💫✨✌️
Huge fan really excited
The Hopium is real

Doctor who new episode as Targaryen
8 million views and out of 8 million, 8 million will be disappointed with the series.
this trailer showed us nothing. literally a blank screen with text for a literal minute what a waste of time.
I m here for the 100th times ✨🖤
Game of thrones polth Vera oru item
Spectacular
Why were African Americans put on the role of family members of the Targaryen House? What's the logic about that?
Take all my money, Game of thrones is back :)
Hard pass but thanks
https://youtu.be/SKjAWA6aSoc
"Am i Girl? No!  no..im not a girl and still not Ginger."
Is this a good series to watch?
All it took was two Jewish writers to end this series
Doctor Who is canon in Game of Thrones confirmed!
Remember guys what they did in the last season they will do the same.
спасибо,что показали черных персонажей которые должны быть белыми,не забудьте там всей съемочной группой встать на одно колено,хорошо что спойлернули,ждать этот бред не буду! вы сделали замечательные 7 сезонов,спасибо за них и прощайте!
The only question that matters; WHO WROTE THE SHOW?  GRRM or those who shall not be named?
Littlefinger will finally be satisfied with the amount of swords in the throne
Love from #Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Look's rad.   Here's hoping the ending to this spin-off series doesn't suck.
*( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)*
Does this have anything to do with game of thrones
Don’t fk it up like season 8
AYO PHILLIP
Our hearts are evil and sinful,  making us unworthy of going to Heaven. But because God is so good and because He loves us so much, He sent Jesus Christ to die for us on the cross. He died and rose from the grave three days later, and now sits on the right hand of God in Heaven. if you believe this in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you will be saved from Hell and go to Heaven. but you also must turn from your sins and live according to the Word of God, the Bible. if you are willing to give your life to Jesus, repeat this prayer with me: “Lord Jesus, i pray for forgiveness of my sins. i believe you died for my sins and rose on the third day, and i claim you as my Lord and Savior. i repent of my sins and promise to live my life for you. In Jesus’ name, Amen.” Jesus will come back very soon to collect His faithful, but everyone else left behind will go to hell. i don’t want you to go there. He loves us very much even through everything bad we’ve done. He healed me from so many things, and i know He can heal you too. God bless you :D
After how dirty D&D did us on the last season of GoT I’m hesitant to trust them or support them again.
Chile I just wanted to see the nice ass cinematography
https://youtu.be/GHIMASbscXA
Cant wait💯📈📈📈
I CANT WAIT TO SEE BALERIONNNNNNN
Can’t wait for the dance of the dragon part,it will be epic
Will watch
omg... I cannot wait for 2022. so excited!
Matt Smith may be an actor in many movies but we all will always think of him as the Doctor
Idc what anybody else here says to me, THEY ALL CAN CHOKE! They murdered Targaryen legacy by killing Daenerys and making her mad out of nothing! She was never mad! i dont give fuck what dudebros in the fandom says.   This spin off could have been everything if only they didnt reduce the Targaryens for nothing. For what is this show? Unless they revive Daenerys and the Targaryen name this show is waste!!
I have been wathed this series 7 time and I would like to watch 8 times before I died
please for the love of fantasy epics, let this serve the same high quality as the early game of thrones seasons and not the hot mess that was the last two
Calling it now. This is gonna suck lol
Game of Thrones was probably the best show of all time at its peak. Hope this is as good was Thrones was until the ending. Glad to see Matt Smith in something this huge too 🙌
the cast has a very unique look....  no more eye candy, huh?
Oh no, the church of woke has infiltrated this franchise. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. What a shame though. As a black man (sorry sorry...person of colour) I find it patronising and indeed racist to cast black people as Valerians when clearly according to the books they don't look like that. This is just a fake and perverse sense of inclusion and diversity. Shame on HBO.
I still can't forget them about the last season of GoT... I won't watch this... 😕
some miami gas https://youtu.be/ORflr1qNrMk
bruh im so ready
Be prepared for siblings to be in love. House Targaryen was always know for incest If u don’t like don’t watch then complain cause it will hapoen
Hope you don't screw up the ending on this one!
https://youtu.be/-_Ty6Xwv7GI👹
https://youtu.be/-_Ty6Xwv7GI👹
Nope.
I think i saw the Tardis in that clip!! 😜👍
I really loved the trailer but is it related to GOT and do I have to watch it to understand what's going on?

https://youtu.be/EYBYRoQBfi8 Briann Eivissa
not looking forward to seeing a bunch of dragons getting killed since it was devastating seeing both Dany's dragons die
മലയാളി ആരും ഇല്ലേടോ 💛💛💛
plot twist : That's Elden Ring tv series 😂
Still angry about the way GOT ended not sure if i will watch this
The throne looks so sick
it's gonna be terrible but still forced down your throat: hbo
My excitement for this show is like 1/10... 10 being ultra hyped.. Sorry but GoT's last season killed this franchise for me.
This will make up for season 8 of GOT
https://youtu.be/xhUQCr6OKKM
Hopefully they keep the feminism and wokeism out of this one
Excited to see Matt Smith again.
Is that Matt Smith ?
Was... was that Matt Smith are finally getting that super messed up GoT Doctor Who crossover the internet has demanded?
Goosebumps
please tell me D&D didn’t touch this
this shit is gonna be fire
Oh HBO, you had me at Matt Smith. Do try and stick the landing this time though.
Are they going to spend 8 seasons making a villain to get killed in 8 seconds?
I was not expecting to see matt smith I busted out laughing. Not in a bad way though love the actor
black targarians? LOL  P.S: did they finish GOT so fast because there weren't playing enoug black skinned ppl before?
If D&D are even mentioned in the credits I will boycott this.
Gonna pass on this one. After investing a decade into the last show only to get kicked in the nuts.
സബ് ടൈറ്റിൽ മലയാളം കൊള്ളിക്കാൻ പറ്റോ... 🤙😝😊
The North Remembers...how you messed up the ending of Game of Thrones.
You had me at matt smith
Não vejo a hora ❤
👍📺👀
yooo is that the doctor...?
George better hurry up and finish his damn fire and ice story, otherwise these are all gonna have a bitter vibe to me. Context has to get updated
Speriamo che, dopo quella palla di merda che mi ha tirato addosso HBO  con l'ottava stagione, abbiano recuperato il senno... l'assenza di Benioff e Weiss è già un buon inizio.
Could’ve atleast fixed what you left with on season 8 first
This is like “When you lived a life that ended in regret then God gives you a second chance at life”
Oh this is going to be amazing!! Can't wait!!
After the last season of GoT, I think I'll give this a pass.
THE SEASNAKEE LETS GOOO
We need Jon snow in the show ❄️🗡
I hate that they casted Matt smith as daemon😂😭such a bad cast
hmmmmmmm.......
Game of thrones ends  Other shows: “it’s our time now” House of dragons:” hold my bear”
Hopefully Starbucks doesn't make it's return in the final season of this show....
niye türk yok la burda
I hope they have move dragons init
Love matt smith's look
Is that the voice of Thrawn from Rebels?
Finallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy😭😭😭😭😭
Kewl
Wow how do more people not know about this?  This video barely trended
Sorry, I'm over GoT. Next...
How long has the Doctor stayed  on Christmas?
200 years before we were disappointed with the last season! 😆
finalmente um trono mais fiel ao livro
Please don't fuck it up like you did GoT.
If they do it like they fucked to the ground the last seasons of GOT it will be shit. Social justice bs ftw ey
I can't wait !!!
Love it
Pog?
So wonderful
Vocês tem uma missão só, seguir o livro. Não inventa de chamar aqueles cara la pra inventar coisinha não, e se tiver que fazer 50 temporadas pra contar a historia FAÇAM, não inventa de encurtar em 6 episodios blz?
I know this is the Targaryens time, but hopefully we'll see other houses who played a big role in GOT get their own shows, ehhm! House Stark, Direwolves rule!
I have lost interest to watch this show after the final seasons debacle.
All the people lining up to be massively let down again: 🤡
I know everyone hates on GOT but cut it some slack it's a hell of a good show compared to others and honestly in my opinion I thought the end of the show was ok, sure some things could of been different.
MANUUUUUUUUOOOO
https://youtu.be/z7LRShroy1g
So excited to see something new ever since Game of Thrones mysteriously ended their seasons at 7
The doctor and his side hobbies. Hardcore mate. 👍
https://youtu.be/z7LRShroy1g
Expectations subverted already tokenizing every character they can.
Imagine crying over a few black actors in a show that’s 99% white.
This looks good, buttt the throne room is complete different, wish it was the same as the beginning of season one :/
One of the longest comment section i've seen on a teaser trailer!! Hope they don't butcher this one
Doctor Targaeryan. He's all dragony-wagony.
Black people targaryens???Man, I have bad feelings about this...
Facebook has commercial fraud! what we punish  Facebook?
I shidded
IM SO HYPE
Why do they have to add looters…
Why did they fuck up the casting on Corlys?.....
When did Balderton the dread die? I'm not familiar with the timeline, will he be in this? I bloody hope so!
I am not healed yet..  I see something from "game of throne" universe,  and I can only think about the worst ending ever made.
Just when I thought I was done, THEY PULL ME BACK IN!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
King, Fire, water, whores, fool, snake– beware of all these: Chanakya niti. I am Sure Chanakya is always behind this Series.
As long as Benioff and Weiss dont go anywhere near this, it should be a good show.
yooooooooooooo
I totally forgot this was still happening... lol!! HBO has some serious balls to deliver this after that franchise killing disaster called "Season 8."
If you're going to invade Westros with dragons just make sure you don't _kinda_ forget about the Iron Fleet!
Looks like a poorly made fan trailer. How many people from season 8 are still around to fuck this up?
So we're really not going to talk about the black targaryens
i hope you don’t fuck it up like season 8 of got
not too many ppl talking about corlys valeryon? uhhhhh, excuse me? hard to understand why they did that tbh. i mean, i know why, but WHY
First person to spot a Tardis in this show, is the doctors next companion!
0.39 can someone which house is this
It annoys me how much people simp for the Targaryens just because they're "Cool" and ride dragons when really they're just as bad if not worse than the Lannisters. Really wanted Blood Moon and I'm extremely annoyed that it was canceled especially when the cast looked so great. I really hope HBO reconsiders and revisits the series because leeching money off of Dany simps is eventually going to leave them dry.
And all I could focus on was the 'An HBO' NOOO ' A HBO'
Finally the barbed iron throne, like the one in teh books.
I hope they don't skimp out on the dragons
*"Dreams didn't make us kings... dragons did."*
Omg hyped!!!!
Omg 😃
Just when i thought i was out…they pull me back in
How quickly does the rampant obnoxious political messaging start, I'm guessing within the first hour, probably with the first scene but I guess I'll have to wait to see how quickly I shut this shit off.
Anyone who is planning on watching this after they way they degraded and humiliated the audience with GoT S8 is a simp.
Racist production.
For this series sake I hope the producers/directors/show runners learned from their predecessors. 1. Don’t hype up the boss fight if it isn’t going to happen and 2. Years from now when this show WILL come to an end that they don’t mess up the last season. With that said I’m looking forward to this spin off it looks promising. The Valerians always did have an interesting arc as well as house Targaryan.
finally a reason to keep my subscription lol
Oh look, forced race insertion into a family of white kings, how original.
Was the whole thing filmed in a closet? I can't see anything! Reminds me of the season 8 winterfell battle.
In Jesus name Imagine being in the military  Yet military personnel can still be arrested by a police officer Imagine being in the military Yet police tell you to leave your firearms outside the sporting event Imagine being military personnel threatening a sovereign citizen with your guns Yet yall both are at the playoffs & you can't bring in your gun My dad Calls his arms Pythons We have a wisdom mentality Matthew 10:16"Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as 🐍 & as innocent as 🕊 " My dad's brothers take it personal When someone threatens our freedom You're not the first person to try to lock us up after losing a fight We go from ufc fighter to attorney in a flash Except you can't stomp somebody in the UFC I've seen my dad's brothers John Michael Cobian&Keith Jeremy Castellano stomp out somebody after knocking them down B/c I have their genetics I'm a threat to take them out in the same fashion their excuse for losing to me$ In Jesus name amen
Só depois que sair a temporada inteira e eu souber que o final não é uma merd@ como foi de GoT, eu assisto.
Gonna pass on this one. Looks weak.
Targaryens are always described as fair skinned and beautiful...
DAMMIT this and aot 🔥🔥  I will be well fed in 2022
Casting looks not good. Doctor who guy not believable.  he's looking like melted snow man. Lee pace perfect for that role.. Casting already looks bad.
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did."  Daenys Targaryen: Listen here u lil shit
0:39 We Wuz Velaryons n shiet
The last episode and season of GOT sucked. If they ended it like Battle of the Bastards...perfect. I was praying they would not try to make it too clever and twisted for a ultimate flop like lost. But they did. Dickheads.
Can't wait
Nope. You blew it. Never again.
0:38 lmao
Please don't be a woke series
Fuck this show, instead of  finishing wind's of winter , HBO went to him and asked write a back story prequel book please.  He said yes.  He thought he had time....  Fuck this show and the book and hbo
Definitely BOOTLEGGING this after the original GOT disappointing ending
Hopefully y’all don’t fuck it up like y’all did GoT
Dumb and Dumber are not involved in this, are they?
I am again ready to love a show only to be brought down by its final 2 seasons.
We didn’t forget what you did in the last season of GOT
Can't they stop making this crap...move on.
Wow. Doctor Who is a Targaryen. Also whats up with the dark skinned people having white hair even when they are not that old? I thought Targaryens were like Albinos, so why only their hair? Does not make sense.
Targaryen : "Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did." Some Guy : Then rule the fucking lizards, GTFO   Funny line :)
black valyrians...
meh...
Just saw this trailer on HBO I was excited thinking it was something different then I saw the throne and saw what it was and now I'm like....great another gay stupid ass story about gay of thrones.....cant they just stop with bullshit and come up with something actually worth watching instead of dumb CGI crap that is worse then a POS swirling in the toilet flushing to go to the sewers.....🖕🤦‍♂️💩💩💩💩💩
i hope it's not Pander everything shit. they constantly ruin good shows with bullshits like this.
cannot wait to not watch it
Lol the black Targaryen guy has been cast for inclusivity lol.
Excited! This better be good💪🏼
Let’s hope they focus on the story and not the cult of diversity.
*I CANNOT WAIT* 🤤
Yessssss
Ok……………….let’s see how badly they fuck up THIS ending.
I'm just thankful this isn't tainted by D&D
Its nice to call the show after dragon and then show no dragons. Gotta love that move.
That shot at 0:37 is a beauty.
Awww shiiit!! I'm ready!!
Yeah and then y’all have to wait 7 years for the conclusion which might be disappointing again  nope I’m traumatized sorry you guys watch it though

0:37 Ornstein is that you???
Targaryan has regenerated to the 11th doctor matt Smith
I hope this doesn’t suck to be honest
Not sure how I feel about Matt Smith being in this. Don’t have a problem with his acting. Just doesn’t feel quite right.
This looks good. Don’t disappoint us like you did with the last two seasons of GOT.
Uhhhh yeahhh!
AAAAAAAAAA  (L)
Me, tearing up: damn this is gonna be so beautiful and incestuous
Hope they didn't shat the entire show with a shitty ending
Cant wait
I wish they kept bloodmoon going
This looks really good and I loved Matt Smith in Doctor Who, so itll be cool to see him in this. Buuuut, I also dont know if I trust like that after how GOT ended 😫 really hope they do better with this!!
I have three words : Hard Hugh Hammer.
Black Valyrians. Yeah. Thanx Netflix, nice adaptation.
Ayyyyyy !
$SHIB is killing it!
So The Dance of the Dragons is something they cannot fuck up.
Oh for fucks sake, here we go again….
Excuse me while I go melt into a puddle. 🤯🤯🤯😱
Does it have potential to be better than got
Will they play Red light, Green light?
Black Targaryens. Hope I'm wrong.
The most exciting thing coming to TV in years !!! Let the GAMES BEGIN ! I'm having Dragon withdrawals!!!!
IM ACTUALLY ABOUT BUST
Why does it look cheap? and changing Veylorans to black was a dumb choice other noble families could have been changed not the ones who are supposed to explicitly look like nazi-aryans. then they doubled down on dumb with the stupid dreadlock wigs. This isn't even the best Targaryen civil war thats the Blackfyre Rebellion.
MATT SMITH MATT SMITH MATT SMITH
Is that Ramsey Bolton (Iwan Rheon) doing the voice over?
Can’t even express enough how excited I am for this! Damn. They better do these dragons justice! Give me BALERION! Haha
this looks cheap and forced, and the apologists and optimists in the comments are cringe.
Yoooooooooo
I was sixteen when I read a game of thrones, I remember exactly where I was and what problems I had that day and how those problems started to vanish soon after the line "we should start back" I'm forty one now and after years of having to get over the fact that il never read the true ending I'm no longer interested in a prequel to half an unfinished song.
Nope

I’M SOO EXCITED

Bi Game Of Thrones olacakmı bakalım bekliyoruz
WTH is this? Not even a sorry for what you did, to season 8?
Despite all the apprehension, I will say that this Iron Throne is significantly more badass than the original one.
You know the throne reminds me of the throne in One Piece. I'm sure people have mentioned it.
Hey uhh, Could you redo season 8 first?
Is “An HBO Original Series” bugging anyone else?
The torch interacting with the HBO logo was cool.
As people have mentioned, even the black people are blond? Lol
Man, the Doctor looks ridiculous with that hair.
I'm going to be honest...who cares to see this? A season sure...but after the wet fart that was GoT season 8, why does any of this matter if you know how the story ends so horribly?
Black Targaryens with bleached dreads?
Ansioso para 22
Que coisa linda ❤️👀
Who is this actor again?! I know him somewhere  Edit: PRINCE PHILIP HAHAHAHAHA
Cool!!
Dude, sweet.
Love how they somehow made the chair similar to the books.
Between this being a prequel and the way GOT ended, I'm not really that interested in watching this. I'll probably watch it after the last season airs if everyone still thinks it's great.
- You have lived too long, uncle. - on that, nephew. We both agree  (Two men fight atop their dragons, above the God's Eye, valyrian blades in hand).  There is no ruining this story.
And I can't wait for you to see the Dragons.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Will not be supporting this show after the butchering of game of thrones hope it tanks
I really wish they show the history of old Valariya.. It's greatness and the downfall of the Mad King 👑
I only finished GOT about a month ago after starting it in February, first half of it made me hate myself for not watching earlier but the ending I’ve known about and I genuinely don’t hate the show. I’ve known about GOT since 2013 and I always had a bit of curiosity but not enough to push me to watch; until I heard this prequel was going to be a thing. Now here I am trying to read through the books to get back into reading a bit as something to help with the wait. Really looking forward to this
"Dreams didn't make us kings....Unless you're Bran."
Shot in the dark here but this show will be as mediocre as the cgi they'll use for the dragons.
camonn
ME DEJO CON LA PIEL DE GALLINA, YA QUIERO VERLA
what's stopping me from believing this isn't going to be a huge let down too?
Screw those guys complaining about the ending of GOT. It was the most fitting ending for the story and the rational conclusion for most of the characters and their story going full circle and repeating the cycle before the change.(Outside of White Walkers and the Others).  So far so good from the trailer. The series is based on the most recent spinoff books, is that right? Need to give them a read, its been so long since I've finished the original series and the winds of winter are never coming at this point. Hah That black armor looks exactly like the one that belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen, which is super exciting.  The only question is: are there black Targaryens now? Don't get me wrong, as far as I remember there were never mentions of black Targaryens before, so that's kind of weird. After all GOT is basically a medieval Europe with dragons and north zombies. But maybe they were mentioned in the new books I still haven't read...
Them: "Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did" Also them: have a war that kills the dragons
LET'S GO.
There's a part of me that wants to care...alas...
I loved GOT before they screwed up S7. This one looks as mediocre as S7 to me, I didn't feel a thing. I really hope I am mistaken.
I really really really hope there’s another Lord Baelish like character in this one
Fix Season 8 first
Why do you wanna watch this show? Me: the plot, the writing, the costumes loads of reasons!!! Also Me: might get to see Matt Smith naked
Who are they? 0:40
If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Maybe they can run a plotline where there's a huge plague and everyone dies because they gave zero shits about anyone but themselves and wouldn't mask up/vax
Did I just watch a hunger games trailer
Imagine.. Actual Armour in a song of ice and fire tale.. Anyone who read the books knows its like a character in its own right, all the different types for different houses and they stripped it down to nothing in the main show. Don't know if it's going to be any good but that's one plus.
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I wish the plot of Loki applied to this timeline...
Где узбеки? Вы что, расисты? Почему нет актёров среднеазиатской внешности?! Это притеснение узбеков по этническому признаку!
Swords and other stuff is back fuck yeah!
Can't handle another disastrous ending. Pass
I just hope this doesn't end the same way season 8 did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBiwWekCDP8
Ahhh a GOT the producers cant possibly F'up, since the books for this era are already written. D&D trashed the last season of GOT because the books were not finished. Still though...1 thumbs down from me because HBO allowed D and D to release a terrible last season of GOT; so my hype for this is zero.
HBO Execs: How much incest is gonna be in this?  Show Creators: Yes.
First episode "winter is coming"
what a weird looking cast
the show finna have like 10 seasons due to haveing to do 200 years of backstory, but imagine it ends with bran watching it
The Original didnt have enough blacks I guess.
It sounds like Ramsey’s voice tho
Here we go again! #ThroneUniverse
There is a rumors that members of the House Velaryon ,known as one of the very few PURE BLOOD VALYRIANS (pale skin ,white hair and purple eyes) houses ,become blacks in the series...the sad trends of our society mistakes continue being transfer into cinema art again and again...You cant fight the racism by violating facts and canons...you only increase it!...Can we just please stop fight american society problems in the movies?
Fails: -Daemon looks like an older Viserys instead of a charismatic warlord. -House Velaryon.....please, they"re from Valyria not the Summer Islands.
Why does house Velarion look like Qartheen? this is so weird
To quote our queen Daenerys from season 2... "WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?????"
Don’t even care after the last season. Took my appetite off this series’s
Please be good 🙏
Keep the script writer of the last season of GoT away from this show..please!! please!please!..bwaaa 😫😭😭
HUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
#shrirambodybuilder
0:19 is the main part. Click, repeat. YaY
Why are all the targs so ugly. I see a disturbing lack of hot people.
New Starbucks opened in the filming studios.
Not watching, no interest whatsoever after the bullshit they've pulled with Season 8! Don't care if it is not the same showrunners....😤
As long as david and danny aren't touching it this has a chance of being decent
You're one of my favorite YouTube artist. We'll have regrets for things we did not participate in.Investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life.
Just make sure the books are done before release a new series.
Here comes the spinoff
tamil dubbing release
Hopefully with Matt Smith here this just turns out to be some really strange Doctor Who special.
Idc what anyone says im excited for this
Who wants to relive this tragedy of a series..
It'll start off well then turn into dog shit
Not even Matt Smith can resurrect this dead franchise.
Yeeeeeeeees!!!!
If david benioff and d.b. weiss are in this in someway then is doomed to fail sooner than later. Otherwise could be a good re-start of the franchise
Better call Saul was better than Breaking Bad.. Hope this one too is better than GOT...
chills!!!!!!! omg! i can't wait!!!! fire and blood
Thank goodness they didnt cancel this!!!
David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are not showrunning this, so it will not turn into shit at the end, im glad of it
Don’t forget to drink starbucks 😉
Fuck it, it all goes to shit in the end anyway
HBO decided to break the lore of the entire world when they woke casted a black man for house valeryon... also, let me guess, there will be one character of every race in here (even if it doesn’t hold true to lore or make sense) and a gay and non gendered character too.
So bloody exciting for this one , i hope they learned from their previous mistakes with GOT last season
HBO kind of forgot, that they turned the show from an epic fantasy, to a compendium of memes.
No thanks...this show will be so woke it will be unwatchable. Take your bs and shove it HBO.
Will we see lyana  stark?plz reply
Please, hire Ramin Djawadi as your composer
House of the Dragon it power of soul darection world peace full soul it call  Dragon of the king of light constitution discipline of light amen

Valyrians: Very fair skin Silver hair with a golden sheen The eyes are blue or purple. This tolerance will kill the world!
Game OF Thrones 1-8 ❤  best Serie ❤🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪 . Wenn ich weiß Dany ist in 8 und 9 Staffel Böse , was will ich da mit einer 10 Staffel wenn die alles nieder brennt . DA fande ich den Sprung Besser❤ jeder Mensch hat ein durch Dreher und der kommt gleich  und nicht  erst 2 oder 3 Jahre später . ❤
If you go to 0:41 the redhead is wielding the valyrian steel dagger Catspaw the dagger that killed the Night King.
Are y'all gonna have any black people in this one or what?🤔
0:40 WE WUZ DRAGONS N SHEET
If they let us down again,  mask off and we burning the whole damn industry DOWN 🔥 🔥 🔥✊
Please don't fuck this up and do some plot armour crap like GOT stick to the real lore.
CONSUME!
Blackfyre and darksister sighting!
Knowing what I know about the Targaryen civil war is still not gonna be enough to keep me from losing my mind  every episode. Sometimes it's worse knowing what's gonna happen.  And we better get some Nettles!
Probably written and directed by the same jokers that brought you lost.  Pieced together by a blind Eskimo seamstress.
Will this still be on HBO television? I would rather watch it live there.
Amoooooooooo Brasiiiiiiiiiiiiiiil
Zzzzzzzzzz
I love it! Woooow
The fall of the Aryan Race
0:39 I hope it's not Valyrians.  I am not hoping they would give them violet eyes. But they skin was whiter even among white people. I understand what people on west are obsessed with they look and skin color, and some people just love to make money on this idea, but still. Why not just use the original source? 😁
Please, we need the Daenerys's resurrection at the final season of House Of The Dragon, we miss her :(
Season 8 killed the whole franchise.
I want to get excited about this show, but then again I don't considering HBO ruined years of watching GOT for me with that crappy season 8 ending.
A reason to live....
It all leads up to Jon reeeeing at a zombie-dragon...
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯😍😍😍😍 can't wait
Keep milking bois
Please please don't suck
Looks like political cgi bullshit to me
HBO please cast people who have albinism in this. I say that as someone having the condition and they would save so much money on hair dye!
i guess the question is if hbo deserves another chance to try a got show
Nice teaser. We all know it’s going to be woked as fuck. Pass.

is D & D still part of this.. if not.. im all in XD
So all black family will kill ? That's why we don't see them in GoT ?
Why Velarion is black?
Wow looks good
Season 8 of GOT was great. The Long Night episode was pound for pound one of the best episodes period.  Everyone was just butt hurt that it didn't go the predictable way most shows go where everyone lives happily ever after.  That's what made the show great.  From season 1 where a beloved character gets their head chopped off.
Fingers crossed they don't screw this one up 🙂
LoL doctor who is a Targaryen
Anyone know if dumb and dumber get any job offers these days? I imagine some productions are willing to scrap the bottom of the barrel.
Okay here we again.  Ingredientes pra dar certo, Luxuria, surubão, peitinho, e sangue. E sem finalzinho revista capricho.

0:42 House Stark
❤️❤️❤️
I'd rather just have a re-do of the last season of GoT lol
Is this going to be the Blackfyre Rebellion or the Dance?
I don't know how to feel.
I wonder how many meetings, phone calls, and script corrections he had to do for this show.  Then think of all his other concurrent projects he also is working on: Dunk and Egg,  the animated GoT series, 9 Voyages, 10,000 Ships, Flea Bottom, the GoT Broadway play, his other HBO projects (Who Fears Death, Roadmarks, Wild Cards), his movie In the Lost Lands, and finally Elden Ring. Think of all that time not going towards Winds of Winter.  Yeah, we're never getting that fucking book.
A dragon is not a slave!

After that horrible season 8 of GOT I am not that much excited to watch this spinoff like before I was waiting for it.
Where is King Aegon ?
Choose your plan? Torrent.
I bet Night King is still marching towards the wall. also, Matt smith looks freaking goooood.
i wouldnt mind seeing danerys at the end of show
Anyone else watched this like 50 times?
Yeah Hell! Fire and Blood!
I'm more excited about this than anything!! The amount of emotion I had in just this 1 minute clip!!!!
Wow a story about a bunch of inbreds. Is this the start of the Democrat party
David Benioff & D.B. Weiss not around? Maybe it has some chance.
Netflix you 🤦‍♂️🤢🤮

This better be more than just dragons and fighting. I want great characters good nice pace storyline and great dialogue and I want it just as good as game of thrones but different and the battle scenes need to be sick. Like imagine a child on fire screaming mama. Now that's hair raising
I am very exciting can’t wait for 2022 it looks great expectations are very much heigh 👍👏🙌…. It will be great to see  arya stark family ancestors .
I'm so HARD
So they feel the need to put the black man and the asian woman in the trailer so those shallow woke people go: "Yeah! Diversity!". Pathetic.
Matt Smith... Not sure if I can unsee his previous characters. He'll have to go batsh1t crazy 🤪 🔥 🐲
I'm already ready to hear game of thrones funny  comments
Why are these Summer Islanders in the regalia of Westeros nobles? Are you perchance trying to push something, here, hbo ?

Yesssssirr been waiting for this👌🏾🐉
pls DO NOT fuck this up again~
Okay, but you're on thin ice, HBO.
Wow, trailer with 80% effects and 20% of pure bullsh
looking foward to memeing this meme
Oh so you give us the worst ending season of any show EVER!!! With the most ridiculous ending EVER!!! and now we're supposed to get on board with another story brought to you by the people who really know how to screw up a great series?  Why don't you go back and re-shoot the whole last season of GOT and then maybe we'll consider watching something else, if you fix the hundreds of things that you screwed up in GOT. Otherwise.... No Thanks, I'll go watch re-runs of Friends. LMAO!!!
Don't... Don't give me hope.
Nahh you already screw it up.
Thanks god for give a reason to live
After what was done with GOT, you think we are gonna watch this. Nope!
Today is my Birthday 🤘
Ehhhh
We wuz Targaryen
Maaaatttt smiiiithhhhhhh

Where are the Dragons?????
And they will rush the last 2 seasons and ruin all the build up.
I wanna watch it now 😭
Matt is going to be a Dragon! waaaat! Nice!
We want got in hindi
The Doctor is gonna smack dragons with his screwdriver 😂🤣
2022 año chido!!!
Can't wait to see how dog shit this turns out
I am flabbergasted 😮

Doing a prequel to GOT is the same bad idea as bringing Jared from Subway back.
Oh My

Already looks shit lmfao
Black dread

We finally gonna see the legendary House Targaryen in action !
Chega me arrepiei agora 💝🥵😍😍😍

wtf is hbo max cmon
we all already know it wont be as good as got
I'm excited for this actually! It looks good:)
I hope this is not directed by D&D 🥴
We wuz Valyrians N shiet
maybe you guys should get Zack Snyder to re-cut the last season of GOT, then give us the Arya spinoff that we all actually want.
DOCTOR ?! What are you doing ?! Go back to the TARDIS right now !
don't release any episode before june 2022😀
Yeah yeah Btec GOT 🤣
And in the end, it didn’t even matter
Dracarys 🔥
I just hope they don't make a mess of this like Game of Thrones Season 7 and 8.
I’m pumped. I just hope society doesn’t crumble before we get to see this!!
Only George R.R Martin could save this franchise at this point and he’s too lazy to do that.
Is that david tennant on the thumbnail
Looking forward to watching the show but not the ending 🤣
I do not understand why we should watch this, because everybody of us know how miserable got ends.

Can’t wait!OMG❤️‍🔥

I am excited  to see arya stark if we can get her back in this series
Dr fking Who yeah boiii

Because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment, now is the best time to invest and make money 💯

Nah I’m not getting invested into another GOT show after that finale!!! Stay away from me and my family!!!
You can't have your House of the Dragon until you finished your Game of Thrones  _But I don't wanna!_  Come on just 4 more episodes. Here comes the airplane!  _No I don't like it!_  What's wrong with you? You used to love everything I made for you but now you just hold your nose to what I make  and look at me like I'm insane.  Okay you can have House of the Dragons I just haven't decided how to finish it yet.  _o no not again._
Black TARGARYEN, you fucking kidding me?
I thought it'll release in 2023 Or 2024. This made my day great 🔥🔥❤

I’ll wait till it’s complete. Look at reviews and then decide to binge watch it. You are not wasting anymore years from this once game of thrones fan.
This does not change the reality of failure in anything
Name: House Of The Dragon Teaser: Has no Dragon
Some of the biggest issues that made GoT Season 8 bad shouldn't be an issue w this series. For example, we know how this story begins, what the climax is, and how it should end, with maybe a few modifications by the screenwriters. GoT didn't have that. It also, to put it politely, got rid of a few rusty members of the crew, not looking at any duo in particular.   The budget is also probably huge since if HBO can revive ASoIaF through this show, it can milk some of the other histories from the books in other spin-offs (Robert's Rebellion 🤞). So, all-in-all, I'm personally pretty hopeful for this series.
No one: Ramin Djawadi: we'll bring back the Targaryen theme and we'll have them all
George R.R. Martin, finish Game of Thrones before you make a bunch of spin-offs. What's the matter with you?
Is this from original material from martin? or they came up with it?
Damn..... I can't wait anymore ❣️
I’m not happy with the casting, weren’t the Targaryens known for the beauty? Other the Emilia Clarke, they’ve miscast every Targaryen.
Fool me once...
plz god make it good
I love this history
"...... Dragons did" you fucking right 🤩👍
Jesus gave his life on the cross and rose again to forgive our sins and have peace with God for Him.  If you repent of your sins and return to God, you will be saved and have eternal life and you will be called "son of God" by the grace of Jesus ......
Oh no step dragon, I'm stuck.
MaTT SMITHHH
Let's hope it's better than season 8 🌝
I'm just waiting to watch the entire series and regret it when I realize that the end season sucks.
Even though i kinda hate the ending of Game of Thrones, still this goin to be HUGE again for sure. Can't wait!!!!
hbo ya çoluk çocuğumun rızkını basarım
I'm not longer depressed 😍😍😍😍😍
Pathetic GOT finale Sorry but IDGAF about your new series
…alrighty then? Did people not get enough of season finale?
They'd make more money if they remade Season 8. Just complete remake it from scratch and pretend the last one didn't happen
Will this start with shitty writing? End with shitty writing or just be shitty writing start to finish?
Nothing to see here, just the doctor messing around with the Tardis again.

RIP KHALEESI SHOT DEAD IN HOUSTON, TEXAS 😢  https://youtu.be/DZJvh52ZKqA
Still waiting for The Winds of Winter.
I liked the last season of game of thrones, and I look forward to this show.
How was the iron throne made?
Know what if we actually stick to fire and blood and history set up in the books. I’m a massive fan of Matt as the doctor so I’m fucking all in.
Missing john snow❤️
Actually pretty hyped to go back into this world :D Hope they give it the time it needs to end properly.
I will miss tyrion lanister & others
I wish I could live rest of my life with game of thrones contents !
FINALLY !!!! 😭😭😭
What's the point they fuck the ending anyway. Like they did with game of thrones, silicon valley etc
Redemption!!!! Now to revive the series with a fresh, new story and actors that aren’t burnt out and just want to get the project over with
Dissapoint they're not doing the Aegon's Conquest. Oh well
Una pregunta todos los de pelo blancos ok descendientes de daneris
Sin jhon snow no sirve eso
My only hope is that they don't fuck it up like got
I literally just Finished Game of Thrones Today and now this ‼️ so exited did not like the ending of GOT tho
Let’s just hope it has a better ending...
Just release it I can't wait 🔥😍

Can't wait for the first 80% of this series.

“Gods. Kings. Fire. And blood! Dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did.” Looking forward to House of Dragon coming to HBO Max in 2022.
This ended up so lame, why bother wasting our time?
Still not over how Game of Thrones ended 😭 like, what was that!? Should we be preparing for the same but praying we will be surprised?!
What is Doctor Who doing there?
meant to have heaps of dragons and dragon fights… not a single full dragon shot in this trailer just a dragons face
Probably build it up for years and have another shit ending
No se preocupen chicos, al final de este spin-off se despierta Brian y se da cuenta que no puede caminar ...
GO MATT SMITH!!! GO.
I'm so happy about Matt Smith being in it
Please take your time to tell this story. We don't give a shit about spectacular visual effect and action as long as it's not for the good of the STORY.

Ребята, не просрите и этот сериал!🙏🙏🙏
nigga corlys lets go imao
Oh my god still can't believe , this is gonna happen
Hell to the yeah!!!
This is so cool and all but HBO you guys should make Rome Season 3 and continue the show like it was planned till (and maybe after) the death of Jesus Christ
Hmmm.... Better not be a disappointment. I'm still traumatized and healing
Still waiting@
I'm ready excited for this series 😍 But I really don't remember most of the events that happened in Game of Thrones 😐🤦🏻‍♂️

american production is kekw no 4k in 2021
MOARRR DRAGONS
Oh yes. Finally we see a Targarryen on the iron throne (besides the mad King). 😁
Remember everyone: GRRM actually finished writing this part of the story! (That's part of the reason why he hasn't finished Ice & Fire yet). Also has different producers. So it probably won't suck.
I’ll watch everything but the last season, learned my lesson from the last time.
I kinda forgot about this series after season 8.
Will it release in hindi ?
Please hbo release in hindi language 🙏 please   In India 🇮🇳huge fan following of your all shows but middle class family don't know English so we request to also release in hindi language please
The Targaryen theme playing there at the end... chills
A thrones series where I know exactly what’s going to happen for once.
Doctor... What are you doing? lol
Fans : We want more GOT HBO : Best we can do is a lame version of it where you know what happend without watching it
I cant wait !!!!!
My Doctor!!! Couldn't have found a better voice for the narration...
Please don't hire D&D for this one
Hoping this spin off will wash the bad taste in my mouth that was the last season of GoT
I just hope the last season of this doesn't ruin the story the same way Game of Thrones did.
I just don't care
Aaah no after what you did to us with GOT
Dragons exist Every army in westeros : why do i hear boss music
Evide malayalikal evide??
I just hope its better than the final season of GOT
At one point I expect Matt Smith to say "I ride dragons now..........Dragons are Cool........" #doctorwho #whovians ;)
Can’t see this being that great,
I look forward to seeing those dragons.
OK. Looks like I'm the one to popp the question - how can a Targaryien be black ? (Not a racist btw)
Matt looks bored and ridiculous
Matt Smith voicing a trailer is fantastic.
What is hope for this show? D&D aren't the writers 😏
black targaryens, of course
😍Love From Kerala, India😍
The voice of ramsay still haunts me...
I'm so excited that the Iron throne looks a bit more like the one in the books.
So you purposely gave us a one minute clip so you couldn't screw it up. And you still screwed it up. I think Daenys the DREAMER would disagree with your shows cool little motto there

0:37 That Dragon armor looks good as hell dude!!!! Reminds me of Dragon Knight from DOTA 2
I think the Targaryen's belong to Europoid(Caucasian) Race, wel Done HBO
Pl  Don't end this like a shit
Why bother with the journey when you've already seen its pointless destination? 🤷
Y'know what, fair enough.
same crap as s8 ?
Matt smith no elenco  meudeus ::0000
Who cares, we know how it all ends and we hated it.
Matt Smith?? Lets gooooo
Hyped.. i mean for real.. f.ucking HYPPPPPED!
They better not mess this one up. Season 8 of GOT was 🗑
Когда 2 серия Нового Ведьмака?
I'm so excited ... And also speechless while i'm watching this teaser... 1.17 minutes full of laughs on my face... Eagerly waiting ....😁😁😁💪💪
Rmin jawadi is here too i think ❤️❤️❤️
HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!!
If we forget for a minute about how fucked up the ending was, i think we can still remember how good it was for many seasons. It looks really good, fingers crossed!
Okay . Targaryen were Elite and the first, but Lannisters were Majestic ❤️
I can hardly wait to not watch this for another 10 years then binge the entire series over the holidays.
They should instead make a Documentary about how catastrophically the last show was ruined, would be more worthwhile
I have a feeling they will hint at the whitewalkers even though they're not relevant to the dance
GOT ന്റെ ഈ ഒരു തിരിച്ചു വരവ് പൊളിക്കും   . ഇനി 2022 വരെ കാത്തിരിക്കണം
Thanks HBO 👏👏👏👌
*I’m just happy to finally get new content featuring my favorite Fantasy universe ever!*
Hopefully they don’t rush the ending again like the last game of thrones. It was all going good until the last….just Terrible!
now that is good
Looks pretty fookin' stooopid. LOTR with no soul.
Great! 👍
A bit skeptical to watch especially after how the show ended. I will always remember what it leads to in the end
I'm in this and it's awesome!
0:42 is that Jaime Lannister in the left side of the screen.....
Fireee
Season 8 really ruined this for me.
Is that Ramsey’s voice ?🤯😂

See, here's one major reason I believe this will be better than GoT. This entire series will be ALL George R.R. Martin Source material. This story has a beginning and end written by George. Who is brilliant. GoT' storyline advanced past the books source material and D&D butchered it. We'll finally get to see an ending the way George planned.

I spent years enthralled by GOT and its world building only to have it shit on completing at the end I can safely say,  no thanks, I  don't care at all anymore nor am I interested in wasting anymore of my time on this property. House of 🖕.
https://youtu.be/yXLU_d4ZheM soooo cute 😁
Beyond stoked!! 🔥🔥🔥
I’m most excited about the fact that Matt Smith plays a big main character in this show, as I love the Doctor who series and he was by far my favorite Doctor  (the tenth Is a close second)
CAN’T WAAAAAIT!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I dunno GOT we had a bad breakup and I’m not sure if I’m ready to let you back in my life after the shit you put me through
Não entendi, falem em português. Anitta faz alguma coisa!
I like Matt with the blonde hair 😏
Dumb comment the dude makes.   Literally dreams did make you kings.   Daenys the dreamer dreamt the downfall of Valeria and convinced her house to leave before the volcanoes went off.   Which propelled their house into westeros and allowed them to rule with their dragons......so it was dreams.   Probably not even gonna watch this shit now, looks dumb
@yara queen
This is milking as far as I'll allow it. No more spin-offs after this
I know this voice
💥😍
Hindi dub please 🙋🏻‍♂️
Instead of making a new show, fix the disastrous final season of the show you already have/ruined.
John Snow ❄️
I really liked the video!Keep working the miracle!That's great!Happiness to you!
You ruined this series so badly, I have no desire to watch this. I gave the trailer a shot and I felt nothing.
Seems like HBO is taking example from Netflix with their casting. This by no means is a compliment. Lol

This looks better then the Witcher.
Y'all complaining about the last season of GoT, as if you skipped over the Dorne storyline.
oh. my. shit.  And I'm stuck in England with no HBO... great.
I'm not thrilled about this one.  I probably won't watch it.
I’m so excited for this! I miss GOT
HBO just kinda forgot people don't care about GoT anymore
The Dr. as the main character. Sign me up!!
And all was right with the world again😭😭❤️❤️
In the books, there arent a black targaryen -___- ... Why they had to put their woke agenda? Im tired that hollywood is putting white characters into black only to fullfill a quota... P.D. Before of attack me people, this is my opinion, im not white, im a latina tired to see the damn woke agenda in every show, serie, movie -____-
LUNA - Madonna 🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/IgIeNQMGThs
Nice move deleting an opinion you don't like HBO and thx for solidify my point. It's like nazi germany all over again..
now that's done, please do the Tales of Dunk and Egg too?
PLZ DON'T LET IT FLOP LIKE THE 8th SEASON 🐺
Is this an episode related to Game of Thrones?

That looks amazing.. D&D is back to being remembered as the RPG its supposed to be.. all is well...
I cant wait😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Только неговорите что тот чернокожий чувачелло с белыми дредами таргариен...
The problems with prequels is the never look like prequels. So why do then. Everyone here should be old to give the illusion of this taking place before got.
Was that doctor who with white hair I just saw
BOOK-ACCURATE IRON THRONE???? COUNT ME IN!!!
I'll give it a shot, but Matt Smith is an immediate turn-off.
Please dont mess this up
Whats the point....we already know how epicly trash the end is haha
Matt smith never fits in anything other than Dr who.
#HouseTargaryen rocks tho they did our queen dirty in GOT
Why? Why he's black nigga?!
study with me
I've read the book Fire and Blood.  There are so many events I can wait to see happen.

Meh. Money would have been better spent remaking season 8 of GOT.
Olivia Kate Cooke is more suitable for acting as a princess !
Oh lé Jesus Murphy!!!!!!  I just can't wait. My life without GOT was so bored. Finaly a good series to watch.
Winter is coming 😂😂😂😂
Things I'm excited for. War of the ninepenny Kings and Battle of the Bells
Hopefully, they don't Fark this one up! 🤦🏾‍♂️
Awesome 😍
Please, let someone who is interested in the story do the show this time.
Can't wait anymore
Please make it the old way like game of thrones
I hope this is also gonna be about how the Targaryens came to Westeros and took the throne, and not just some Targaryen inter-family drama. That just doesn't sound very interesting!
Not having any Starbucks coffee cups on set / I frame is a solid start for this trailer. However all roads lead to the Dan and David debacle that were the last two seasons of GoT. I’m out.
Just redo GoT Season 8. Thanks.
I guess no one will kinda forget about the army of the dead. 🤦
With all these cool targaryan characters.  I wonder if we will have room for any cool schemer's like varys and little finger
Ben 10  Mature series
This time I'mma wait till it's finished so it doesn't turn out to be a disappointing floppy shoe like Game of Thrones.
Can't wait ❤
HBO--- what we people think, is This squeal of Game of thrones or you had put Dragon in this plot to owe viewership😊
Why do I hear Ramsay's voice?
This ship has sailed, you screwed up GOT and now expect us to trust you won’t repeat the exercise. NO sale.
I have missed Night King
Hayden Christensen must have role in this series
Eh
മലയാളി like adi❤️
Будем ждать !! Я 3 раза смотрел восемь сериал !
Lengends will start watching GOT now...after watching this teaser😂😂
Só esperamos que não faça que nem fizeram com GOT no último episódio.... uma decepção   We just hope they don't do it like the last episode of GOT... a deception
Get GRRM to write story and don't invite D&D to direct this.
Not me crying over a freaking trailer...
https://youtu.be/MOWwdJ92p3U 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope that the Night King appears
Can't wait for this though I want to see Aegon's conquest as a prequel series too

I do think they have chosen the wrong actors for the Targaryans this time, they don't look right.
Thanks

I can't wait to watch this for 8 seasons, where the previous 7 have nothing to do with the 8th!
Are you gonna fuck us with this like last time?
More Game of Thrones??? A man can hardly wait...
Surprised it's not called Dance of Dragons.
200 years and they haven't invented electricity... What a waste.
Them got youtubers will have a content again lol. Those awful theories lol.
They do actually put every brittish actor in games of thrones don't they, now it's all seven of them xd
I thought I might have a chance of escaping this but of course you chose to cast Matt Smith. 😭😭 Now of course I have to watch it. 😭😭
After season 8, i am skeptical
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bring it!  :)
They got the GOT look so i hope they are better storywriter then the last one
0:37 Finally Undyne being used for good
Can't fucking waitttttttt
Please don't be like season 8
KGF 2 TRAILER DIALOGUE COPY
❤️❤️❤️
Knowing how got ended. I am scared for this.
The Iron Throne is horrible in this prequel. Who thought that putting swords under the steps would be a good idea?
The North remembers....  ... How terribly the last season ended ...
What the hell does "ORIGINAL" even mean at this point!?
that dragon you hear at the end will make an appearance in season 8. just an fyi.
0:29 who is this?
Only going to watch because of Matt Smith.
I see Matt smith I click
За#бись!!!
I'm waiting
I just came here to see matt smith
So glad they're rebooting Game of Thrones after it was tragically cancelled after season 6!
They’ll fuck this up too.
Omg!!!! I’m sooo excited guys!!🙂🙂
Pretty sure they arent any black Targeryians, HBO defenitly going full diversiry after they were critised for having too many white actors.
no d&d, excellent
We want kit ...
A non JR Martin story in GOT written by dumb and dumber. Great what could go wrong?? Not like everyone hated the last 2 off book seasons or anything.
Am I the only one who thinks they gave a spin off to the most irritating and lame storyline of the GoT universe?
As long as it's not like the last rushed season of 8.
7 million views on 24 hours.
Oh God are they going to incorporate black and Asian people into this to. Make it more "diverse" it's going to look as goofy as Witcher.
Malayali undo evda
Now just don’t rush it and we could have a great show
Good
Honestly after the foolery of the last season of GoT they dont deserve the views or the hype. Looks pretty dope tho
Fire and blood
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⚔️
DRAGON SPOTTED....  @0:17    Staring right at us.  I didn't see it until my second viewing.
QUICK!!!! Do D & D have anything at all to do with this!
Please be good.
I think I'm going to faint
Похоже новой книжки так и не дождусь (
2022 will be epic - New GoT show and also the new LotR show from amazon ! <3 can't wait
Give me one reason to give a care in the world. I don't care, because of how badly HBO treated Game of Thrones' ending. Please, keep D&D far away from this at least. Maybe it won't end with a wet fart.
OMG this is going to be EPIC
You have to gain my trust again, HBO.
Series வெற்றி பெற வாழ்த்துக்கள் 🥳🎉💥
is that velaryon ? why is he black ? or perhaps im wrong but??
Where is our khalise
Gods, Kings, Fire and блядь
😍
So is this based off of George RR Martins book?
I’d better not be disappointed like the last season of GOT…
Don't worry guys, when this happened the Night King was still marching towards the wall 
Lol didn’t even notice.
Please also make the hindi version of this
കട്ട Waiting ആയിരുന്നു Bro, 😁♥️♥️♥️
This is big for Matt smith go on
Wow!
So my question is Where is the dragon❌
I'm so fucking pumped for this? Just don't let it end like the last season 8 of game of thrones
I just hope they ain’t rushing to get this show done because 2022 seems pretty close.
Excellent  ::https://youtu.be/WYPMbvSFOMM
Heeelll yeeeeessss
I'm happy cuz D&D wouldn't get a chance to ruin the story written in the books. So this show gonna be fantastic as the first seasons of game of thrones, so I'm fascinating
Так там же Горыныч 👍)  С ним интереснее будет 👌

Just for the record my hair is already this color and not because of some television show.

OMFG
I’m not sure I wanna commit to another 10 years only to see a weak ass ending like they did with the first show..

Hopefully Matt Smith lives more than one episode. But knowing Game of Thrones, he'll be beheaded two minutes in and they'll throat fuck his decapitated head the rest of the series.

Lol, no thanks. Season 8 of the original series killed all interest for me.

HBO already proofed they can not write GOT without books from RR Martin, no way Doctor Who can carry a show with bad writing and overly used CGI more then 3 seasons
AN HBO ... AN.
Can't wait  I hope they do house dyerwolves to😁
"Dream Didn't Made Us King Dragon Did" 🔥
I just dont care, prequels, meh, we pretty much know what happens.
damit so I guess I need to go watch Game of Thrones to understand this?
This hair is so waird. Black people have only black hair (pigmentation) to protect their head (and body) from the sun on the ekavtor.
Wait, why is the Eleventh Doctor cosplaying as Daeneris from Game Of Thrones?
Omg I can't wait!!!! This is going to be epic
😭😭😭😭😭💥💥💥💥💥
0:50 wow they are trying to be more accurate to the novels this time
How do I watch it in India?
I really hope the creators understand just how much the alienated the audience in the last season. This is about the family if the character who ruined everything for us. I have no interest in this franchise anymore, and neither do any of my friends I would talk about this show with. I didn’t even know this as a thing until now.

Watch a show where we already knows how it ends?  Pass.  All of this still leads to bran the broken done with game of thrones world.  D and D destroyed it forever for me.
I cried a little, I can't wait for this
I AM HALF DEAD AND HALF HEAVEN
Looks interesting, of course im incredibly guarded after what they did to the last 2 seasons of GoT...  House Velaryon looks really cool, i like their aethetic, though i'm not sure how the blonde dreadlock mixed race characters will fair with the public, having a feeling thats going to spark alot of debate from the edgy right wing fantasy fans. Not sure it was a good idea to have the Targaryen 'knight' look like the more classical impression of Rhaegar's armour. I'd prefer it if they had a less West European medieval look and more GoT fantasy dark ages style look for them.
Balerion, the black dread!! Let’s go! 🔥🔥
SHIBA INU TO THE MOOOOON 🚀
Oh my goooooood!
Thanks a lot HBO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dragon Who ?? :)
OMFG IM SO EXCITED
I like how HBO thinks that the only way for black people to be cool is to make them unlike real life. Black people don't have white hair. Why don't you portray them normally? Nice racism in the name of anti racism
Thank God we’re done with fake teasers…
Don’t care
Matt Smith makes me wanna watch and I haven't even seen GOT lol
please realse in hindi language
Please release this in Hindi
Not intrested. #RemakeGOTS8
Fookin kneelers. You better pirate it.
Yes! Yes!Yes!
Wow wow wow wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
After what HBO did to the last few seasons of GoT especially season 8 makes me hesitant to even watch this.
When they refer to 200 years before the fall of the throne, do they mean the Targaryen rule? Or do they mean the tragedy written in season 8?
I vowed to not watch this! Now I have chills! Dammit!
WOW!!!
We know.. This also Have negative end loke GOT
I don’t want to see without Danearys
Matt Smithh
Uh, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss do NOT seem to be part of this one. Sooo it might not be a pile of garbage. That is- if people give it a chance after Weiss and Benioff were let loose in the final season of GoT. Ah well.
Belief is the death of reason
One week before I finished got season 8 And now this Waiting
Looking forward to it. I  know it will be good....
https://youtu.be/D-ovljBTeHg
The wait is long to 2022 but at least they have shot the series so that's good news....
The iron throne looks different like it has more swords now
Here we go again for another 15 seasons of pure Targaryen egocentrism...
Ramin Djawadi back ? Sign me in!
so excited
On fire😋
PLEASE END IT WELL
I don't know if I can handle another heartbreak tho. And seeing how we know it ends in the future, it kinda taints it for me. I pray they have better writers and adaptors. I pray D&D are nowhere near this project.
GOT sucked, Vikings was better....
Let this franchise die. You've already slaughtered it.
Fjb
They should have just re-shot the last season of GoT instead of making this.
Night King and cersei Lannister   still alive
Excitement level is 0
My first thought before I clicked this video, "It's Matt Smith! Doctor Who?"🤩 I already love this
I just hope they don’t screw this up the way they did GoT at the end
This show shouldn't be compared to the  game of thrones ending. There's new writers and even grrm has written episodes for this.
The Crown for a King
Nah, I'm not falling for that again.
Bgm faadu 😁😁😁
I love the Targaryen but personally I would have loved to see a series about the Night Queen and the lord commander of the night watch story. Might have explained why the White walkers needed children as she was the only female and why? But all that was somewhat retconned when they made the children of the forest the night walkers creator..  Or made a show based on the war between first man giants and children of the forest before they banded together against first invasion of the night walkers before the Wall.  So much about the Night King etc that was left hanging. That I find more intriguing then a bunch of Targeryan batteling over the throne.
Ждём , будет жарень
YES! Matt Smith is back.
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did."  Daenys Targaryen: Listen here u lil shit
Why danereaous targaryen is killed in GOT and where the dragon taker her off ? answer the question then go to 200 years ago of the series

OMG I can't wait
Цікавеньке
So basically this is Prince Philip's life before he met lilibeth
Is D and D s running this series too? Hope not.
We want india release
this needs a few more genders and women in leading roles before i'm watching
Black vikings, black Targaryen... What's next? Black Sharlock Holmes?
For all Who never read the lore books regarding the Dance of Dragons, dont be afraid: the ancient Targaryen civil war Is easily the most fleshed out event of Westeros, and unlike the main storyline 200 years later, this one Is already finished. So no risk of botched, rushed endingd
Ofc a black dude with blonde hair lmao
Waiting
Super
as i predicted :v nice! i wanna see more dragons :v
Can't wait
this is some supersayin' shiiiet
In hindi plz 🙏🙏🙏🙏
😁😁
Is this movie or series..?
Valió cada maldito segundo la espera
No questions about it, I am ready to get hurt again.
Please dubb in hindi
Doctor Who 's regeneration power gets weirder every time.
already better than cringe game
Can’t wait. Dance of the dragons arguably has the best potential of all the GOT lore.  The story is classic. The fights amazing. The drama engaging.   Yes yes and more yes!!!! This is gonna be a great show.
An old targaryen king fails to produce a male heir for the throne so when he comes of age finally chooses his only daughter Princess Rhaenyra as his successor. After that he re-marries with a lady whose name is alicent hightower and alicent gives him 3 sons. The old king does not open the succession thing even after the birth of his sons. Queen Alicent and Princess Rhaenyra are cool at first but slowly Alicent wants to see her blood and the throne and begins the schemes. A civil war which includes the entire realm and 16 dragons. This series will be epic.
0:38 Hello there
OMG! YES!
Let's hope this do not have an ending like GOT Season 8...
Trailer is awesome
I love this
Dreams didn’t make us kings , DRAGONS DID  GOOSEBUMPS 🔥🔥🔥
I hope wokism will not destroy this series.
I'm going to give it a chance but I fear I can never love again.
Black blonde? White Zulu? Give me a break!
Why would I waste my time. Look how you ended the last one.
For night is dark and full of terrors.
GOT😍💥🔥❤
Damn gonna read fire and blood again
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Waiting 😎
I'm excited to finally see something new in the game of thrones universe, we deserve something great after that last season
Where dragon
Abhi maja aayega na bidu ❤️❤️❤️❤️
look how they massacred my boy
Siiiiiii
I miss u game of thrones 💜💜💜💜
Imagine the hype if game of thrones actually finished well
#noexcuses
HOUSE OF THE DRAGONS IS ABOUT TO BE EVERYTHING AND SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT..... ANOTHER LEGENDARY SHOW ABOUT TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY...
Woooooowwww
Tbh not even excited anymore they broke my heart with the last season I had such high hopes.
I hope that whoever found this comment stays safe, healthy and financially blessed in these hard times ❤️
Reminds me of a show that started off great and sucked shit at the end
Make sure D&D have nothing to do with this one, don't even let them glance in its direction
more game of thrones is a yes for me just dont disappoint me again hbo plz 9 yrs watching for a crappy ending 💔
It's difficult to get excited about a prequel when you know the main plot ends in complete trash.
omg. i felt these tremors within!
House of the TARGARYENS ❤
No dragons in the trailer for House of Dragons :(
This had better not suck😑, wasn't super impressed with the trailer
"this might be the return of the throne"
🤯
Is that Ramsey Bolton voice??
I'm happy to see Prince Phillipp is ok and reigning in some other place
ngl I missed this world no matter how disappointing I am about how the show ended. And I love Fire and Blood so I can't wait for this.
Aaaaaa que lindo cara
this is garbage how could you do that to Velaryon?
No thanks  There can be no forgiveness for the 8th grade level ending of the original series.  Cancel this crap now and redirect the production cost to the immeasurably better Raised by Wolves.
0:36 That's a bummer. Keeping the ludicrous concept of slashing through fucking plate armor. 0:50 And nice attempt but they should have recreated the actual throne as described this time around. Long as D&D aren't involved should be pretty good.
Когда показали тот самый тронный зал, аж мурашки пошли! 👏
Yea i mean I'mma still watch but I don't have the same excitement anymore 🤷🏻‍♀️
meh the way GOT ended im good. nothing was more disappointing
6M views in one day for a tv series, that shows the power of Game of Thrones
welcome back to westeros guys
Waiting 🔥
Kutha rampu
Now it’s HOD 😌
Waiting
What, black valerians, do you know lore at all?
Oh look, the woke has arrived...
Finally, can't wait to watch this series♡ gonna love it
GRRM is involved with this show, so if we go by his book Fire and Blood, this show will start with Aegon's conquest.
https://youtu.be/OxHssgQ7tvo
I’m glad to know Dr. Who went back in time to be a part of the House of Dragon… the only person who can rewrite the wrongs from the end the series 😅
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD!!
حمااااسسسسس ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
The ending of this spinoff will be that of Bran in a chair envisioning it all 
Better have kept D&D far away from this project
Its hard to consider watching this after the carnage they did to Dany's storyline and ruining game of thrones. Just have to try and think game of thrones never happened after season 6.
Please... Don't ruin this one for everyone
Looks like they made the iron throne how it was written in the books

Let's see if this ends well or will it be just as bad as GOT
So this is the cast for Eternals 2 💯
👍👍
I will pretend the last season of GOT didn't happen and watch this.
What's the point of this again?
As long as Benioff and Weiss are not involved in this at all, I might give it a chance... the wounds of season 7 and 8 have still not healed
Is this Matt Smith?
Is it joke, rly?
Cue the theme
Yeah 5 October is the best day (Sora in smash and house of the dragon trailer 🙌)
They screwed the pooch too hard with GoT to make this remotely interesting to fans.
Damnnnnnn wasn’t expecting this!! Wooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The ending of GoT already ruined this series
Night king?
My English is bad, but I hope I made myself clear. Why do you spit on canon for the sake of a certain group of people? Velaryons by canon are the same as Targaryans. But you didn't give a damn about the canon! You haven't studied biology? If you want to introduce dark-skinned characters, you don't have to spoil the canon. I am more and more convinced that modern films and TV series are disrespectful to the original sources and the original lore and canon. I am for the diversity of people, races and genders, but I will not tolerate the disfigurement of the canon. Ugh.
ну, главное, что негр есть
Peter dinclege 😊
What's the use when it's the Bran who ends up getting it.
Relax, The new writer for this show is the guy who wrote “Rampage” starring The Rock so...  ....yeah GFY. Art is dead in America. All bridges and frontiers have been burned.  Music, film, Games. It's just stolen hack.  As soon as Ellis, Welsh and Palahniuk die, those old things called books will be just as meaningless.  Listen kids, just study finance and develop a healthy sexual and drug addiction. The Arts are for the birds.  Choose life.
Wait .. Where is the dragon???
katta waiting
Excited, recently watched GOT and i forgot how amazing the first 4 seasons were, i hope this can resurrect the epicness.
The Duke of Edinburgh got reincarnated as a Targaryen 😆
I just came
This trailer gave me the chills
Why there are black people as Targaryen? Are You kidding me? This is outrageous! You political correct idiots!
Ohoho game of thrones is coming back
*Expo2020 Dubai - Garden in the Sky* https://youtu.be/bqe-db3QpuM
Got is a shitty show (last seasons certainly), why would this be any good?
cade os dragão
Game of Thrones is back again...HIP HIP Hurray🥳
Daemon ''GOD'' Targaryen
0:34 Doctor is that you?
Princess Rhaenyra dies by execution . In case anyone is wondering lol
Espero que no la caguen como con la vil muerte de mi Kalessi
*GOOSEBUMPS*
I hope it will live up to the hype...
Final episode...fades to black and cuts to Bran sitting on the throne with white eyes envisioning all of it...
Still traumatised by how awful Game of Thrones turned out..
:)
why is corlys black?
Hbo ruined the franchise by destroying that finale.
Definitely not going to watch this after what the last directors did when they decided they were done with the show. GoT is just a cringey memory now.
batter then S8
no thnx. probably too much of an disappointment
Most awaited story of MAD KING
So… Where was that missing page in 11th Doctor biography titled “Daemon Targaryen”?
The experience of the last two seasons of Game of Thrones is holding me back from developing any interest in this...
🔥🔥
Look like a random World of Warcraft cinematic.
ok I'm in
House stark banner 0:42 along with Bolton banner🙄
Putins Huilo ibanoэ lalal lalala lalala
so cool i'll be here for the show
https://youtu.be/aORbHvMy5pQ
Loved the background music, reminds me of danys journey!
This made my day guys holly shhhheeeeeeeshhh
Make an Elric series already, not this derivative nonsense.
I miss the 1st 6 seasons what I don’t miss was the last 2. Give me great acting with a consistent story and that would be a GOT worth watching.
Black Targaryens 😂
I have high hopes, we have high hopes.. so please..
😃
R u fckin' serious? Black Velarions? The pride of Velarion's dynasty - PALE skin, violet eyes and white hairs, it's important here!!!! Otherwise the whole meanings is lost!!!! I'm not against blacks, but if you make black Velarions, it's will be crash.
Woooaahahh
not sure about everyone else but I don't want to invest another 8 or so years into another game of thrones series just for them to throw away all character development and piss on the fanbase so 'll probably wat till it finishes to see if the ending is worth it.
Kind of kills the vibe after what happened to GOT , which will never wash away.
No….
No
Many seasons will come, numbers of king will die, only THRONE remains as it is, always 💜
Happy to see Draco Malfoy in a major role again
Any neet aspirant
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Oh dear more shit.
the best part is, they can't botch the last few seasons, the whole story is there, beginning middle and end. they just have to fill in the blanks.
yes, i know it's coming in 2022 but I'm gonna need the exact date and time so I'm prepared
YEEEEES
The episode I want most is the trial by seven with Ser Duncan the Tall at the tourney at Ashford Meadow.
This gives me joy 😀
They do this one like they did GoT least season, they gonna get fire and blood 😒
0:38 SJW ruining things again, House of Velaryon are Valyrians not black. Smh
Hey, is that Matt Smith? I could care less for GOT. I really dislike that show and it's writing.
super hit
so tough to make it
fire is coming
I genuinely thought this was an edited Mashup for the Crown where they threw on white hair.
it better ave boobies nd beavers
"Dreams didn't make us Kings, the TARDIS did"
US : But what if we prefer Game of Thrones? THEM : They don't get to choose
The Old Iron Throne is back!!!!!!
Imagine with all this hype things turn out worse than season 8 🤔
Hope they are going to pay Goldie Lookin' Chain royalties for that...
I have no appetite for this goat crap after they butchered the main series.
Exciting hmmmm love it
Visually, this is stunning.
I'm here for Matt Smith.
If there was the house Targaryen score too in this.... 🔥
😭😭😭 Danny died, the one death I couldn't get over and to watch these just 😔
0:39 House Velaryon in action lets goooo
Never knew Erling Haaland was a Targaryen
no more of this shite plz ffs
Where are the dragons 🐲
Filme ou série?
fake witcher

ONE WORD! AMAZING!
Бред конечно. Так можно по 15 сезонов по каждому дому в игре пристолов наклепать сериалов. До 2250 года тянуть.

Yeah.... Let's milk that cow before Amazon launches the Middleearth series.... 🤣🥳
Could you have picked uglier actors?
JUSTICE FOR DAENERYS
Prob gonna shit the bed on this one too tho
Could've been great but the black washing makes it clear this has been infected by the disease that is the left. #whitepanther
If it's gonna be like the first 4 season I will gladly watch it, if it's gonna be like the last 4 I won't watch a minute thanks!
"dreams didn't make us king, dragons did" .... Then where are the dragons bitch?
Uff 2022 is too late. Can’t wait that long dude
Game of thrones season Hindi me kab aayega
So. FREAKING. EXCITED.
Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait to see them butcher the books again.
It's going to be legen (WAIT FOR IT) ....
Woohoo! Can't wait the targyreans Era !!
Please just do the last season right again please we’ll just prentend like it’s a multiverse thing with magic that they saw in a crystal ball and in reality if you re do the last season we’ll be cherry
How bad were seasons 7 and 8? Well I'm not hyped about this prequel, sad but true,...
Fear cuts deeper than swords
Coming the lagend
Not a single dragon in the trailer 😑
‘Fire & Blood’ is a truly fantastic book and I’m so pleased to see it brought to life on the screen.
I'm watching again and again repeat after repeat
When the first season?
คนไทย ไลค์
يارب ماننخذل نفس قيماوفثرونز
I still have a bitter taste in my mouth.... I don't know if I can invest time into this only to be disappointed.
Looks Incredible. Roberts Rebellion should have been the first prequel though.
Am I tripping or is this Matt smith??
Super lots of love from TAMIL NADU
Dreams didn’t make us kings. Dragons did. 🔥💖🌹🎶😎💕😍🤯🤞👌😱
É um teaser mesmo...falou e falou e não disse nada kkk
I just hope they end it up nice this time 🤦‍♂️
негры блондины таргариены - это кайф)) сериал опять с прогибом
just stop, s8 was enough disappointment
Bro the Iron Throne looks so good
It's funny how stable the political system and how constant the technology remains in these series. I mean there are virtually no countries today that were like their 200 year old counterpart.
dr who fans winning
what's the point when you already know where it leads to 🙄
So "The Winter is coming" again...
So HBO is going to fool us twice? Shame... Shame... Shame...
it's going to be shit
WHO...............................CARES? WHO...............................CARES? WHO...............................CARES? WHO...............................CARES?
We can't see a single dragon 🐉
I'm still angry that Bran became king and John went to Nights watch hope. HBO learn from marvel and create another timelime where they make the ending great or atleast make it a dream 😴💭
I’m over all this fantasy shit and you should be over it too
Broke immersion already with the Jamaican Rasta man. Gonna suck balls.👎👎👎👎
This time *"summer is coming"*
Once i get my written apology explaining why season 8 went the way it did, I’ll try to watch this.
Now that's an Iron Throne
Everyone forget how fast they messed up  game of thrones ? Is dan and Dave on this one i hope not they are so bad.
Bah, bad teaser
highly Waiting
Completely uninterested thanks to that shit Thrones ending.
Why not make something new, like a new adult fantasy series?  GOT still has a bad taste stuck in my memory.
Despite the fact that this is a story about Dragonlords, it's more complicated in its political aspects than Game of Thrones was without dragons in the mix.
*Exited* *?*  *Hell* *yeah* 😭😭😭
its more like i didn't kill mysterio , drones did.
Is it just me, or does this remind anyone else of How To Train Your Dragon? "This is Westeros. We've got dragons!"
0:35 Matt Smith looks like Tom Hiddleston in that shot.
Black Velaryons??? HBO, really? You are not Netflix, guys. Be better than than, please!
HRH Prince Philip finally wears THE CROWN 👑 of a king.
no
Fire and blood 🩸

Круть скорее бы уже
There is nothing like a Black Targaryen. Hollywood needs to stop forcing Blacks in every movie.  This is not historically correct and it's utter rubbish. 😒😒😤😤
Enjoy people. Trailers and teasers are the only good stuff.
WTFFFFF LESSSSGGGGGOOOOOEEEEEE!!!!
Please let the first episode be a remake of the last episode
I heard that at the end Bran is going to wake up from being the third eye raven.
WE MOVED
As long as D&D didn't come near this I'm all in.
Know it will be battle btw game of thrones and loards of the rings
Hoping the same thrill as GOT🤞
oh hey it's the doctor
Ok, just tell me: the two guys who killed the last season haven't touched this show and I'll watch it.
I wonder which Aunt and Nephew will get it on in this one 🤔
Black targaryens with White Hair lolllllll
https://youtu.be/sQ7uSQn4Em8
still hoping for robert's rebellion to be adapted
Dragons-1 Kings - 0
Nostalgic goosebumps.. HBO owed us big time. This is the ONE chance to take us back to the show we loved for the right reasons.
At the Beginning of the Dance Of Dragons House Targaryen Counted 18 Dragons. I cannot wait to see if they put then all in, Dragon vs Dragon.
The ending of this spinoff will be that of Bran in a chair envisioning it all 😂
Don't worry guys, when this happened the Night King was still marching towards the wall 😂
Sir ek bar mujhe bhi pin kar dijiye 🥺🥺
Wonder if the Night King will be in this one.
The music sounds like it’s from Theophany 🔥
Nice
Esse dragão com 4 patas ta me encomodando
Shit already looks dark as fuck. We can’t see y’all!
do u want Scotland Ireland independently? if u want  china will help u! just like u help Taiwan!
https://youtu.be/qhoYyuGgDK4
I am not gonna watch it if it isn't strictly based on something GRR martin wrote
Got chills🐉
We want teaser every month till release
I like it
This will be great. Can't wait to see all the dragon fights.
kalite mis gibi kokuyor
https://youtu.be/-RAglyw6ySk
dont get too excited...  just want to know ONE thing: WHO is writing this show?
Does not look that great tbh
https://youtu.be/wfXcIYeWtTA
I hope this won’t have a bad ending like GOT
Vê se não estraga tudo dessa vez HBO.
I hope they do Roberts rebellion.
Aww nah sorry watched the last series only to have a blind cripple boy sit on the throne &be king of the realm
oh my god literal goosebumps throught the teaser
Now thats gotta be Dr Who's best adventure yet
Can't wait 💗
Oh shit here were go again 🔥❤️
https://youtu.be/SLnHOSf6VIQ
If they didn't absolutely botch the series finale of GoT I would probably be excited for this
Dreams did'nt make us Kings,, Dragons did !!!
To the person who is reading this, don't give up on your youtube channnel becoz i m not giving up. Good luck for your channel guys❤️
Эх, жаль, что не взяли в этот сериал Тревиса Фимела (Рагнар). Он бы точно украсил этот сериал.

Я тут один из рамки?
oh my god
The Casting is Cancer...
OMGGG IM SO EXCITED
Looks epic! Waiting for the show ))
Dany will always be my Queen!
Seeing Matt Smith is quite a rarity, so it's a real treasure when we finally see him in such a big show or film. Smith honestly sells this for me, I'm so excited to see his performance.
Jjk’, end
I am so happy to see Matt Smith

matt smith really doesn’t suit blonde
Please tell me D and D aren't allowed anywhere near this series
No country will allow local forces to separate independently! We will not allow Taiwan to split!
Thanks to the shitty ending in GOT I have absolutely no interest in watching this!
This is got season 9
https://youtu.be/sXuDuKBEQOc
People want to watch this after 10 years of lore, character and story building only to go against its own story because the writers thought they were clever, doing the opposite and going against the story. Joke. GRR Martin, sell out. Not even bothered with the new book, lazy.
The cast are looking very weak
https://youtu.be/sXuDuKBEQOc
Im sorry but I cant unsee Prince Philip 😭
I am a D&D freak...that's Dungeons&Dragons, not the other one...the abomination...
doctor
I hope we get some Ramin Djawadi musical themes in here...the trailer already gave goosebumps to me
Is the book like a story-book with characters saying lines and all of that like GoT? Or is it just like a documentary-history book? Cause IF the book is with lines and all that - Benioff and Weiss did a really good job when they had actual source material to work with. Gotta give them that. If that's the case, give'em a chance to redeem themselves.
actually tho, dreams kinda saved your butts from Valiria's fall, so give it some credit
Another masterpiece
Is that doctor who
u guys commit crime with last season of GOT plz don't ruin this time plz, it hurts!!!
Matt smith, great actor
Malayalees ingu poru
i mean if the last ending wasn't so bad id be looking forward to this
Please don't include David benioff and D B weiss in any project They already broke million of hearts... With the last season of Game Of Thrones... Whatever it was.... But Game Of Thrones is love ❤️❤️❤️
MATT SMITH! HELL YEAH
If only GoT's last season had NIGHTKING as the Final Boss...now the whole vibe is lost...
Ahhhh shitttttt ! Here we go again So now i have to go for the HBO subscription again
So are they gonna do a shit final season or actually care this time?
Yesssssssssssssssss!!!!
La justa y el duelo en la arena tienen una pintaza increible!
i expect a similar story wasting endling like you did for GoT therefore i'll wait a few years and decide then if i waste my money or not.
Matt smith😍
Unlike pota omma punda evamla

This isnt going to be one of those "fool me twice" things, is it?
Please, don't disappoint.
In meinem Haus streite ich gerne mit alten Leuten die eigene Probleme haben weil ich denke ich bin als vollkommener behinderter selbst ein Berater für Gesundheit 😄
keeping expectations as low as i can. i want this to be good too badly.
WOAH 😍😍😍😍 Man, I'm stunned!
Maybe GRRM is finishing book 2 of FIRE and BLOOD ....
10,000/(average movie length=100) = 100 movies only
I hope they start from Aegon the Conqueror and not Aerys the Blunderer
A book by Archmaester Gyldayn of the citadel of Oldtown....... a brainchild of GRRM.
Elric of Melnibone rip-off :P Dragonlords , dreaming city, etc etc...
Hope for the best, expect the worst.
Zaldrizes buzdari iskos daor.
I don't like choice of actors for some of the main characters, so I'm not sure I will watch it if visual is not right for me.
They better not fuck this one up too
Reminds me of danny  sadness ;(
The prequel won't work, because GOT didn't make those history sound epic and hair raising, we just got the feel that they were a bunch of incestuous crazy purple eyed blondies. The First men and their empire building though, that might be worth making prequels on.
I still have season 8 ptsd
شكل العرش الحديدي ماعليه كلام 🤩🔥🔥
🤢
Bad girlfriend
a dragon show? no thanks. We've already seen plenty.
Benioff & Weiss: where is Arya ? No one: where are Beniof & Weiss ?
Sorry that i came so fast
heeey GUESS WHAT!? i already know how this story ends and I reeEEEEEEEAAALy dont give a shit how it started.
I'm so excited about this serie
Any malayalis wait 4 house of dragon
It looks interesting because it's the Targaryen. We've only seen one of them thrive in GOT but still somehow stole the show. It's their hair and their dragons lol
why all Targaryen are like evil metrosexuals? I was expecting something more for the epic dragon riding family.
I dont know if I would invest the time in watching another GoT series, seeing how pathetic they ended the first one.
Hindi dub
Fodaaa, só falta o trailer de The last of Us tbm! ❤️
Is it next year yet?
This show had such a shitty ending that I'm not even hyped about this.  Those white walkers were suppose to kill EVERYBODY as a  repercussion for having wars and ignoring the greater enemy. That feminist energy killed that show and I know it's gonna be in this one too.
The only thing that'll ruin the show, is the actors. Never liked Matt Smith (as an actor) at all but his performance in the Crown was quite good.... maybe he will be a surprise.
So the Doctor came back in time and decided to be a dragonlord, fair enough
The North Remembers the 8th season
Если драконов не будет на нафиг надо это

Wigs look even more cheaper! I am gonna pass this and wait for reviews!
Fuck HBO they burned us last time and ruined so many characters like hell anyone is gonna pay money to see this shit just pirate that shit if you want to see it so bad
Okay so if it's 200 years before does that mean we'll probably see Dunc and Egg?
cant wait to see Harrenhal burn

So, the TARDIS landed in the realm of Fire and Ice
it looks stupid
Haven't recovered from last season of GOT yet, hope this won't make it worse
House Velaryon is not made up of Summer Islanders...
It looks so beautiful
I don't think they could have picked a better period from George's vast history to adapt as this will have all the elements people loved about GOT: multi-faceted characters, twisting and turning political intrigue, epic and costly (in terms of budget and dramatic loss) battles, and high fantasy dragons galore. What's new here from GOT is that the conflict is all couched within an inter-family civil war, which will only heighten the drama in certain respects, as we all know what it's like to fall out with your family members, though usually your family don't have dragons to make matters worse... or better in this case! Plus, this show has a clear beginning, middle and end, so no final-hour missteps in the writers room we can hope!
It's not porn. It's HBO.
We need in Tamil version please 🥺

One character in this is the doctor from doctor who
Too bad no one cares anymore since you killed the franchise
I mean, not that I don’t want this, because I do, but I honestly thought they cancelled all of the GoT sequel/prequel plans after the S6 hate. I loved almost everything from S6, not hating, I didn’t want that ending but there was enough foreshadowing that it didn’t seem faked out of left field. Honestly you want to break the wheel but you’re going to follow the incestual pattern everyone else followed?
wow, much diversity, such wow!
❤️ from india
After season 8, I really don't have the heart to follow this.... So I'll probably wait when it gets the public reception.
I almost applied for a role in this series a year ago
ah "more money making" is done. how about you fix the last 2 seasons of game of thrones, hbo?
Черный Таргариен - это уже перебор ...
I'm just happy we get more Game of Thrones
Hope the martells get a better screentime here
meehhh probably it will be like the other one...
Not watching it untill the last season,just to be safe.
So glad dumb and dumber are not involved.   So HBO learned the lesson from the last season of GOT?
And we are Indian 😭😣
where are the dragon skulls in the throne room just saying
Looking forward to watching this show.  Not looking forward to everyone bleaching their hair after watching this show.
Y'all gonna fuck the last couple seasons of this one up, too? Feel like we have a right to know at this point.
They completely destroyed my interest in this show with season 8😓
cant wait for them to ruin this one as well
I had to to pause at 0:18 so many time 🔥🔥 imagine finally getting to Balerion the black dread
Game of thrones season 8 left a very bad taste ..i donno whether i should be hype for this or not..
QUE LINDO CARA😭
GOT stans must be having a heart attack. #Enjoy
Some Targaryen were a bit burned 😀😀😀
THE THRONE
#nerdout eeeeeeeeyyyoooo
Can't  wait  need  game  of thrones  in my life  hopefully  this  isn't  the  only  show hopefully  there's  more 🙏

🔥🔥🔥🔥
Schrödinger's fandom, simultaneously hating GoT and looking forward to a new shit series.
I see Targaryens, Baratheons and Starks
So, all seasons will be finished in around 10 years 🥲🤒 I mean great I will be watching it with my kids
They got Moqorro in here??
Sorry HBO.. u killed it already 😪
OLIVA COOKE
Let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
K...king Ghidorah?
It's how Elric of Melniboné's series should be.
Got season 8 those freaking brothers I hope they are not working on this
Black targaryens with white hair WAIT WHAATT!!
Really hope they plan to take their time with the whole series on this one, like they did for the first few seasons of Game of Thrones.
House of the dregon have very large dregons then game of thrones
Black valerian’s with platinum blonde hair….lol. They should change the name of the net work to SJW Max….. everyone knows how this horrible show ended. Better hurry up sheep… Your masters or calling you back. You’ll only have to wait two years in between seasons for a show that you know ends horribly. Losers
Hopefully D&D had nothing to do with this one because I'm not going to invest if they did after Season 8.
Spoiler:     Can't wait for the scene where Rhaenyra sits on Iron Throne and bleeds
"An" HBO original series? is that right?
https://youtu.be/4dt_LnavKd0 people have the right to know. 😐🔫
The Dance of Diversity... everybody loses.

🕉️🚩🇮🇳
_VALAR MORGULIS_
Man m still not over how they butchered the show in last season
After the mindf*ck that is Game of thrones, Hbo is back to suck the souls of young audiences around the globe.
Looks hella stupid.
Do we know if Ramin is back for this?
Отлично!
What has the Doctor gotten himself into now😂
Hopefully it will be better ending 🐱
https://youtu.be/L9KfkEqbVXs
Hope they keep GRRM as a writer and a co collaborator in the series .
Compare this teaser to the Wheel oh Time one.... Completely different Vibe... This looks intense AF!  Love it
So glad Dan and Dave aren't involved anymore
GOT hive we back!
Let's goooo
Absolutely not INTERESTED.
Gush! So excited!!  Please make daenerys appear on the 1st episode lol! Just to make sure she's alive😂🤭😂🤣
I’m praying this show doesn’t have a garbage ending like the original show. All this epic world building and all of these great seasons just to destroy years worth of storytelling in the end. Please please please not again. PS: don’t make the dragons weak & unintelligent like in the original GOT series. They don’t have to be Eastern Dragons, god like, but better than what we got originally. The “durability of humming birds” (Lindsey Ellis), when the plot got dumb, one shot by ice spears, with no advanced intelligence. Make the dragons into actual characters, not just plot-devices & vehicles.
This looks great. Can we also have Robert's Rebellion please?
black Targarien. now i saw everything
Omg omg omg
WAITING
Nice
Abb ayega mzaa 🤩
tarumlüg  Programmierer der Master  K.  I.       ..
Why is Corlys Velaryon black
The damage is done HBO, only thing you can do to revive this franchise is a shame parade of D&D
Yeah nah you're like an ex who we had dreams together for 8 years ready to get married only for you to run away with the best man or bridesmaid. And now you're coming back for a second chance. Sorry😞 I lost my hope in you after that. Not again!!
Silver hair galore this series will be
Where are Ned Stark and Roberth Baratheon...
Can dan and dan fuck this up too?
Надеюсь, что не обосрутся как с последними сезонами ип.
How many of you are the fan of daenerys or targaryens family
White-haired blacks, long live tolerance! facepalm
If dragons made you king, then we, Pokemon trainers must be god
You guys already ruined a great series going for 2 I see
Good to see dumb and dumber is not here to spoil the whole show like game of thrones.
Any malayallis
geralt of rivia is targerian 😂
Bro, 2022 is long! When in 2022!? We need to know!
When come in india
https://youtu.be/hs_UcfmKPy0
🔥
Can’t wait 🔥
No more raping this universum. Please. No more.
Are all characters ugly choosen?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9udljzflcck
Omg, they put black actors for valyrians...
They still fkin up the design of the throne huh
Черный Таргариен.... Я не буду это смотреть
That’s kinda racist
Corlis Velarion is just the spitting image of a Valyrian...nooooo
We need the Conquest of Westeros!
This is 200yrs earlier than GOT so were going to see lots of Dragon alive here?
I still have not seen this show
All episodes should be released at once
Trendinggg💥
The Doctor is in the house. 🔥  I love Matt Smith.
GOT again 🤔
not impressive 👎🏻
Where is the f***g dragons?  This series is all about dragons but you guys didn't even show a single one. Are those VFX guys are still working on it to make a 2 seconds clip?
Kgf teaser is better than it
Well we know how it all ends, still disappointed even now. Those Tw*ts DB and the other one totally ruined it all.
Couldn’t they find new faces? Jeez. Where was the original casting producer of GoT??
LMAO after what you did to Game of Thrones?  NO THANKS! HARD PASS!
Maybe this time don’t give me hope and then rip it away from me
Wow
After GoT 8x3, as a fan I can't watch this serie. I don't want to live the same delusion.
targaryan were the most powerful  hbo: ok we need a black targaryan cuz black power but sire they were all blond and white hbo: ok we make a nigga with blond hair
Multiracial Valyrians?! It is absurd and looks silly a.f. esp. considering that Martin was pretty explicit in his descriptions. Can you imagine casting Asians or Whites or Pacific Islanders for a fantasy series based on Zulu or Masai lore? Or blacks or Indians cast for a Japanese medieval/fantasy movie? It would be unacceptable, and rightly so... Nothing to do with racism, much to do with plausibility and immersion... Regardless, fingers crossed that the series is good, no matter what. That's what counts when all is said and done, after all...
so not in the UK then :-(
My nob just grew three inches
I don't see any dragons here. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
0:29 does anyone know her name? And is that lord Ramsay narrating?
Pin this comment
They won't understand even teaser they wanted to blackout everything , is there any phobia from light for HBO😂😂😂
Tbh I feel a series like this is too soon.  It's only been 2 years since the end of GOT. I'm much more interested in the LOTR tv series.
Sure will be a war between white walkers and drangons
High expectations
Another banger
7 drangons will be in seen house of drangons
Seeing the THRONE again. It's just nostalgia🔥❤ Excited😍😍😍
Dude... GRR just write the damn books
Does anyone know when the Lord of The Rings trailer is dropping?
❤👍🏻
I hope the Tully's and Starks didn't produce bitchs like Lyana, Sansa, Catelyn, Lysa etc at that time.
Hope to god the episodes in this season don’t need night vision goggles to watch
Not even a single fcking dragon is shown
No quitting the show early to go and NOT work on star wars, please thank you
omg black Targaryen so stupid hahahah
Please..... don't give me hope 😭
Nobody cares
Any indian fan there
Come on baby
When hbo max will release in india
Yup good luck getting people to invest in this after season 8
आता नुसती जाळपोळ होणार 🔥🔥🔥
https://youtu.be/altlFxa-FqA
FINALY...someone got the real picture of Aegeon's  throne
There are legends who are watching this trailer & know about GOT but never watched a single episode of GOT😄
Finally! 😭🙏
Black blond? House Velarion is a complete failure...
oh god another series trying to be game of thrones!!! Oh wait.....doh
Ах да,эти знаменитые ЧЁРНЫЕ Таргариены. Закопчёные или не мылись давно? Мойдодыра пригласите.
If Targaryens were in real world, they would be from Alabama.
Господи спасибо
Why bother when you know it's all going to shit thanks to Dan/Dave anyway...
🤷‍♂️☹️
Dude, the Doctor is everywhere! 😂
Very nice trelar
finally
I'll just wait till it's finished. Looks meh anyway...
This series should start with Drogon mourning over Daenerys’s body in some unknown temple in Valyria before cutting to “200 years earlier”.
More dragons. How exciting...not!
HBO finally understood how the iron throne and a 1000 melted swords should have looked like from the beginning.
I really hope that we will see some amazing actors playing amazing characters
Those two mfs who butchered GoT, got nothing to do with it.  It's entirely based on George R.R. Martin's "Fire and Blood".
Я не понял где азиаты трансгендеры и двухметровые чёрные драг квин , вы что, расисты ?! ... а нет,  вот же они, но азиатов трансов все равно не хватает ..
imagine the incests in this shit lmao
Hey can you like... be a thing in Australia? Majority of us hate foxtel so... that would be cool if ya did...
Fukcing Goosebumps 🔥🔥
this looks good, please stick to the script, do not sway away from it like for seasons 7 and 8; its still disappointing how bad the end for GoT was
FINALLY...SOME GOOD NEWS SINCE THE PANDEMIC
Who’s writing?
So at one point the Doctor was a Targaryen? Checks out!
Valhor morghulis
this is a weird doctor who crossover
OHHHH YEAH! I want a House Of Dragon  t-shirt!! My YouTube Peeps if anyone finds out they’re selling the t-shirts please please let me know 🙄 where to purchase!            🙏🏾 Thank You ❣️
meh
Cant wait to see this show but what they did with house valerion is stupid af
Freaking excited for the official trailer now😻💓🔥
Can’t wait for the South Park adaptation of this
They’re still going to shit the bed
Please don’t **** this one up like you did the last season of GOT
Okay I'll give it a chance I'm interested but I swear this goes bad
Get ready for freefolk to start defame the series in 3, 2, 1, NOW.
I hope they focus on the story, not on forced diversity, race, and sexuality.
200 years. This means we will see actual dragons since there were dragons at that time in Westeros.
Inda ku eppa varum bro
Well pretty sweet as series Game of Thrones series .I hope Sam Jackson  can do overcool recap again .But looks like some serous Fantasy escapism for me next year .And did see this coming with all that's going in the world right now .We all need a short break from everything going on right now .
Esto es tan emocionante!!!! Se siente como cuando iban a sacar una temporada nueva de GOT 😭❤️
consider me 0% hyped
Omg the goosebumps I’m getting from this teaser  🥺
Wow, nigga Targaryean
Sorry. D&D ruined it all for me. Thx HBO
OMG this better be good because the book is sooo goood you better give it justice!
Don't disappoint us like the last seasons of game of thrones were so disappointed
Meh. If their sole existence depended on if the outside world saw them as dragons/Kings/queens/having kingdoms … your shit didn’t mean shit … just sayin…

Doctor Who in the Seven Kingdoms ???))))))
Beautiful
Black valyrians! I see they Stayed true to source material.
Fire is comming! 🔥🥵
It’s the way that that the score played in the trailer has some similarities to Daenerys scores played through the series! IM LIVING FOR IT! Great way to discreetly bring back that nostalgia for us! Love it!
I thought that was Daenerys @ 0:28
This looks better than the 8 season already 😅
Мммм, чёрные эльфы были, теперь ещё чёрные валарийцы…
🤩🤩
I'm still mad, but the trailer looks good.
Lol black targaryens.
Release Hindi dubbed official please 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳👈👈
Games of thrones lover....... 👀 Cersei 🥺 Jon Snow ❤️ Hit like 👍
Hope it's good. But no matter how good this is, my interest for anything set in the TV version of this universe is pretty low after that horrible ending Game of Thrones got. I know that wasn't HBO's fault. That was on the two con artists that were showrunners. But what did we expect from the guy that sewed Deadpool's mouth shut. At the very least i hope this can make for good entertainment. Hope it lives up to the earlyer seasons of Game of Thrones. No plot armor... Just raw unfair storytelling were people die and the plot doesn't just seek to subvert expectations because that's what people expect... I mean, GoT subverted everyones expectations at first. But then when everyone expected it they just subverted it even more because if people guess it it can't be so. No matter how dumb the change was... All in the name of subverting expectations. People catch on and figure shit out. That's just how good writing works. Clues are meant to be picked up on by the best of us.
People said they're done with GOT, this video currently has 6 million views and still #2 in trending nearly 24 hours after release.  Welcome back to Westeros everyone!
💥💥💥💥
Black Targaryens are like black Anne Boleyn. Tolerance has already gone beyond, it's just awful ..

Hello
Welp, this will need some adaptation from my side not to see doctor Who as a Targaryen...
Meh. Going to be as shite as season 8. No trust
"The typical Targaryen features remind strongly of the typical Valyrian features: pale skin, silver, platinum, or gold hair and eyes in a variety of shades of purple, or light blue." Hmmmm... -_-
this looks like the witcher
🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲🐲

Well, at least the throne looks more book accurate (and, more importantly, cooler) than in GOT.
слишком поздно,интерес потерян
😄😄
Is that damn mortal kombat symbol with the fire???
Keep D&D out of this please.
But dreams are what saved the Targaryens from the doom of valyria.... So dreams did make them kings..
)  Y  (
If those two clowns had anything to do with this I don’t want it
They ruined the main story, now what?
Yes, indeed. It is called Lothric, where the transitory lands of the Lords of Cinder converge.
0:24 Blackfyre sword ? Or perhaps Dark sister
It's THE DOCTOR!
They ruined GOT so bad, it ruined cultural impact of books it was adapted from. Don't screw this over.
. GODS . KINGS . FIRE . BLOOD.
Hope, HBO don't Netflix this show
Ohh yes diversity fuck authenticity
0:18  balerion   the black dread
So excited for this
Yeah, black man with blond hair - definitely a Targaryen...... More accurate I can't imagine!
https://youtu.be/AB0ZlwwzAZo
WOW! Dark Sister, Catspaw, Blackfyre, joust explosions, sword combat. These weapons look amazing can't wait to see more! So excited!!!! ⚔🔥🗡
I'm watching  this  for 10th time
What timeline this movie is?
Holy shittt.  The iron throne looks very epic , can't wait till January 1 !!
Excited
Please someone tell me that the background voice is of Ramsey Bolton.
The throne looks more like from the books
Please dub these in hindi too 🙏
HBO- choose your plan  Legend- we have telegram
My tv series list for 2022 😍  - House Of The Dragon  - The Last Of Us - The Lord of the Rings - Obi-Wana Kennobi  - Ms. Marvel - She-Hulk - Moon Knight - Invincible (season 2) - Peaky Blinders  (6 season) - Stranger Things (4 season) - The Boys (3 season)  Oh, Dear Lord 😲
WHO ID THE WRITER!?
🔥🔥🔥
Let's Just Hope That This Show Is Untouched By D&D Brothers.
عمكم ولله
Gods, kings, fire and blondes
I don’t really care. They fucked up the show, and now I’m just waiting for the books to never come out.
so excited, someone should just jump us to 2022 if any of y'all have a time travelling machine
Black people with terrible wigs playing valyrians? focusing on Rhaenyra yet can’t find anything of who’s cast as Aegon II. I knew this would just be more woke bullshit. I’ll just watch the clips on YouTube of potential badass fight scenes, fuck watching all the forced woke bullshit.
I'm not as hyped as I was for Game of Thrones after they showed us they could botch a show at the last season
Amazingggggggg
Hope dumb & dumber are not directing this one
- House Of The Dragon  - The Last Of Us I don't need anything else.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE upload in hindi dubbed , love from INDIA 🇮🇳🙏
Is this a fucking black Targaryen?! This is getting ridiculous...
Weak 👎

OK I promised myself that I wouldn't watch any of these any more, because you know, the disaster season, but this hypmed me up! It reminded me of the excitement of previous seasons.
when you watch this, just remember that pretty much everything turns out to not matter in the end. Have fun!
again for 10 years
Mostrou nada , vim com fone voltei faminto !
"I don't want it"
после игы престолов остался плохой осадок,смотреть или не смотреть дело ваше,но как история показывает обычно первый сезон или фильм бомбовый,а этого нельзя сказать про это)
So a prequel from the greatest show or web of all time called game of thrones is coming to 2022 ok I watch it
this show look promising
Ayo how did they mess up the house Targaryen sigil again (done got too many limbs) 0:52
I barely cared enough to watch this trailer...after how the original series ended, I definitely don't care enough to watch this show :/
Please make this good HBO!!! I beg you redeem yourself.
Not much technological progress happened for 200 years.
a good start a bad end; that's game of thrones
انت ذكي وتفهم لكن من يوصل لك المعلومات يسيئ الشرح، لذلك قناتي لإختصار المعلومات وتوصيلها بأسهل طريقة وكوميدية بعد
The blacks... They are Targaryen ? Or Valeyrion ? Who are suppose to look like Targaryen : blond hairs, PALE skins ?....
why just hbo max?!
Can't wait😍
I cant Wait !!!!
I really hope they won't whitewash the greens...the most important lesson of the story is neither of the sides were good and they both deserved what came for them
oh! I wish I didn't watch the last season of GoT. I wanna watch it again but knowing how it ends its' not that much fun. :(
Hope it's make sense.
I don’t think the white hair really looks that great on some of the characters. It just looks obviously fake and tacky
How could I possibly care about this universe after that final season
They say this time grr is more involved let's see how that goes im hopeful s
I love it when the notification shows up "SOMEONE LIKED YOUR COMMENT" and "YOU HAVE A NEW SUBSCRIBER ".☺️

Isn’t this a huge middle finger to the face since we already know how it ends?

please release in hindi ❤️😘
One of the best people who support this will be a billion one day""" God bless you........❣️❣️❣️❣️✨✨

CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS!!!!!!
Thanks to the last got season my hype for this series is zero.
The music of GOT was enough to give me the CHILLS
Вот столько людей любят Маму ❤
Matt Smith? Vooooooy
Can't wait 💥💥
بريكنق باد احسن
Я потёк 🔥 🤤
I personally don't watch any show that is a Spin-off of the Original show which had a bad ending. I'm done with this Universe.
Noted executive producers, according to various sources and compiled by wikipedia:      Ryan J. Condal     George R. R. Martin     Miguel Sapochnik     Vince Gerardis     Sara Lee Hess     Ron Schmidt Feel free to have your opinion.
I'm tentatively excited for this. But I just wanna say y'all did us so dirty with the end of GoT
Hope! They won't make it too much  fantastic so that they can ruin every thing again! Just Hope!
criiiiinge
Honestly don’t know if I’ll love any of these characters as much as I loved Jon Snow, the Starks, Dany and so on. But hopefully I’m wrong.
Meh, we'll see......
DREAMS DIDN'T MAKE US KING
Looks dumb.
HYPED
жесть!

WTF is this shit
Waiting
:’)
☺️👍
I think it’s going to release in January or February
People who read the books are already 😢
I don't know what it is. I hate Matt Smith's face. And this look makes it even worse for me.
I wish they had stuck with using unknown actors like they did in GoT. Matt Smith as good as he may be just looks out of place.. and that wig 💀💀
Don't screw this one up please.
God damn you HBO. you are pissed on my imagination.  Are house Valyrion black?  no no no this is so awful
ahhhhhhh shitttttt!!
https://www.youtube.com/c/SentientGamer
I just broked my mind trying to think if this is the new or old iron Throne 😂 well what I wanted to say is that this Iron throne looks so cool
I hope they have Peter Dinklage and Harrington in it.
HARD PASS FOR NOW!!!
O M G what a teaser O M G can’t wait
Matt Smith is in this?!? That's all you had to say!
All i saw was matt smith and i was hooked
This episode of The Crown looks wild.
Black Targaryen? What?
Скептическое отношение после последних двух сезонов Игры престолов...
Well, i would watch it if hbo max was in my country... FUCK territorial licenses.

I only clicked because Matt Smith has white  hair
F U. When HBO Max will be in Poland??!!! You have statistics from HBO Go and You know it is good market, so F U for treating us like a 3rd world. ,,|,.

0:46  Bran : ...And I Took That Personally!
Really putting the Tar in targayan there
Ohhh Crap... This pile of shit has resurfaced again. People are going to react to this poor show instead of Masterpiece like Spartacus. From the words of Oenomaus, The House Of Dragon is nothing but a Swamp of Piss and Crixus shall shit on it, to complete the aroma.
i was really hoping i would want to watch this but i really couldn’t care less bc the last episodes of got left such a bad taste in my mouth that  i don’t ever wanna touch this franchise again
Matt Smith😍
Lmao it will soon be time to sit back, enjoy a drink and snacks and watch a whole lot of incest and the occasional dragon appearance.
Okay……but where are the dragons?
Wow…amazing! To see that “House Of The Dragon” looks like a crap-show in the making…This appears like it would fit perfectly in the CW lineup, another woke, diversity mandated, empty virtue signalling dumpster fire in the making…yay!
Dany kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet
HBO is ruining its own legacy, "Dragons did" perfectly reflects the weakness of the story we are about to see, just like the last 2 seasons, no great dialogues, no perfect storytelling, and just some special effects to cover up the weak points in the script.
LMAO!!! That's like making Wakanda part white.
0:39 lmao, black targaryans :DDDDD gtfo
y’all better not mess it up this time
I never watch these shows but through social media and memes somehow I think I'll eventually have a good understanding of it whether I want to or not 🤣😂
Ehh, nah. After last time, I'm not gonna waste my time.
MATT SMITH THO
Who think that house stark and it's saga should have a seperate series?
a high appeal to HBO please dub it in hindi audio also for your  indian audience ,we have huge affection to GOT SO PLEASE DO IT
Chances of HBO and the writers getting bored after a few seasons, do a half-arsed season or two then fuck it up like GoT?
Just gotta meet the diversity quotas and have black Tarqaryens surprise surprise woke HBO
oh!! Prince Philip is here
It's a skip for me. We already know what happens. I don't understand how people get excited for prequels.
So i'm guessing that every single one of them will be stark raving mad and genocidal... That's the takeaway from GOT isn't that right?
Dreams doesn't make us kings Dragons did 🐲🐉 #dragons #goosebumps #targaryens #daenerys 😍 ♥️🔥♥️
Is that Matt smith?
Couldn’t be less excited
https://youtu.be/5MNxutdvlpw
Yes 🔥🔥🔥
All these for what???...so much hype and expectations sacrificed just for Star wars...Wont be forgotten
Ждёмс
Telugu fans
did they really have to choose such bad looking actors? ..
MY MIND BODY AND SOUL IS READY!!!!!
I just hope they don't ruin this one like they ruined GOT the last season
after this we need another spinoff KING IN THE NORTH
Where is my DDDDDDRRRRRAAAGGGGOOOONNNSSS??
I thought game of thrones
Theres 3 type of people whe. Watching this trailer.  1. Don't give a fuck about it 2. I will watch this show but im not that excited 3. Jumping up and down, so fucking excited that they r crying.  And then theres me. 2.5  excited to watch it, cant wait for it to come out, but got better shows im waiting for currently.
And to make it even better D&D have no control over this show they have no involvement! Can’t wait!
I wouldve just retconned the lame GOT throne and modeled after the books but the swords around it still look cool
игру престолов пересняли?\
Perfect materials for the porn industry.
Weren't the Targaryens supposed to be otherwordly beautiful. Who the fuck is she ? 0:28
After the horseshit last season I don't even know if I wanna give GOT a chance anymore lmao like taking a ex back that cheated on you.
I'm still upset at the way you ended GOT.
Don't watch this with your siblings 🙈
I know that dude was doctor who, but he just doesnt have a face for showbiz. looks like a lizard had a baby with david icke.
Do I want to watch this...? Even after that terrible final season? Choices choices 🤔
Mad king on the way 😁😁😁😁
Omg thanks for thiss
my angus is peppered      🥩    🌶️      🧂
Not exciting 1.5/5 stars
Matt smith!!?
Got s8 because of many things but main reason for me it danerys she is my favorite character
Seen them filming it at Caesar's Camp. The production looks amazing.
Shipping would be awkward next year #IncestQuest
2022 finna be lit
let’s make a prequel series about the ancestral family of the Character we absolutely butchered. A TV show about house Targaryen who we literally made go extinct because we’re incompetent writers.
0:56 Dragons voice... Gossebumps moment🔥🔥🔥😨😨
This is pretty much fan fiction
Stark always been a freeman.. Being a fan of GoT from childhood.. I want to see the growing power of stark blood and victorious of Vale.
fire and blood , so many great characters. wheresmy boy blood raven
Congrats HBO, this was everything a teaser should be: short, confusing, vague, disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying. All that practice from season 8 of GOT finally paid off.
I wasn't going to watch this but now that I saw black people with white dreads I'm definitely going to check it out!!!!!  *how Hollywood thinks we think and act.
Who notice the dagger 🗡️ of arya
Thats cool, but will they forget about the Iron fleet?
😍😍😍❤️
Jodieron la saga de juego de tronos, ahora quieren joder la guerra del tridente.
Waiting 😇
What is this? Why I didn't know it's gonna happen.
Can't wait to see Littlefinger's early ancestor, Middlefinger!!🤣😂
Pero que joya se viene tiooooo
Doctor who?
Now fix season 7 and 8
Is it set in Africa then?
Doesnt matter. We all know how it all ends
D & D better not screw this up!            Just kidding, they have no relations to this series :D
👏 👏 👏
Lol I know they’ll have a garden of plotting and deceiving that’s the shit
black targarien oh sh*it
House stark banners in the joust👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
After the two last seasons of GOT I have absolutely NO faith in this franchise ability to create great film art.
whats the point of this show if S8 was a disaster?
Судя по тому, чего они наворотили в последних сезонах... тут смотреть будет не на что.
Let's hope they learned from their mistakes and won't fuck this up
I hope it will be a better series with more dragons and more special effects and more fire. the last two seasons of GOT were very disappointing for me both in terms of narrative and character development. especially the last one was the worst for a fan. Awful episodes and shorter... and thank goodness Ive seen them together after years because having to wait a whole year for me to be served such a bad broth. no thank you 🤮🤧🤬🤢. the eighth season was a mixture of chaos and nonsense. They destroyed key characters for no avail reason  and I think the show's first role was to improve the story of the books. and not to make it absurd even if it is. the show writers/runners had fun as usual to invent so many stupid and unfinished parallel stories. dispersive. I hope they learn and do not count on GOT Fanclub because viewers are looking for emotions but they should not be made fun of. if you tell me a story keep the pace and be consistent until the end. we will see 🙄😐🤨🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
After the disaster that was S8 GoT, I am so over this universe no matter how cool the FX are.
0:09 Does it bug anyone else that HBO, a company with 1000’s of employees can’t use grammar properly? Seriously people “H” is not a vow so it’s not supposed to have “an” in front of it when describing something
Well... I'm excited!
The fact that David Benioff and Dan Weiss aren't writing gives me hope for this show.
What is that atrocious Iron Throne...
Looking a lil corny
But who has got a better story than...
Trop bien
Doctor is that you?
Can't wait 🖤
Can't wait for HBO to ruin this one, I wonder how they'll do it this time.
They casted the most unattractive actors to play Targaryens.
Dude that throne is looking sick a'f
Yes, please.
Корлис Веларион, прозвище Копчёный.
Ok, just tell me: the two guys who killed the last season haven't touched this show and I'll watch it.
Was hoping to see a dragon shot after deamon's dialogue... I can wait
Make it good i did not like the witcher series 1 and did not like vikings. still not done last series game of thrones yet but will get a rewatch entire series until i reach that series final. even though i not seen final series ryan reynolds ruins it lol by discussing it in hobbs and shaw lol. when saw hobbs and shaw first ever time and he said cant believe that game of thrones ending i went oh no as was expecting one of his jokes but he said something about it which i not seen yet lol.  i actually did think when i did search on fast 9 i thought wow really but it was april fools joke saying since f9 brought back some characters they plan do tokyo drift 2. Back to this i hope its good can imagine the ruined hair from constant hair dye, little guy from harry potter did the same lol.
https://youtu.be/6PfHLc4wJVc
oh god, so hyped 🤩🤩🤩
Matt Smith, that's the only reason I'm gonna be watching this. If you kill him, then bye bye HBO Max, I'm not coming back.
where is dany?
WHEN??
They kinda forgot about Euron’s fleet…
PLEASE DONT F UP THE WRITING.
What's IN in 2022? It's incest!
That's Sonoya Mizuno, she also played Kyoko in Ex Machina!
THEM: "Baby, I've changed. I swear. It's gonna be different this time." US: "...you promise?"
Can’t wait to see Littlefinger’s early ancestor, Middlefinger!!😂🤣
Looking forward to watching this show.  Not looking forward to everyone bleaching their hair after watching this show.
Admit how many times you have played this trailer to make it an hour or so long. Just admit it.
In the jousting scene, Its House Cole vs House Tarly........Probably Cristan Cole vs Alan Tarly
Eagerly waiting .... Fan from india 💓
Meh.
I just don’t understand how these commenters could be excited for this trash…
I bet the Doctor was just trying to get an autograph from Jon Snow but TARDIS landed 200 years too early.
I'mma meh on this one. Even if it's really good, a prequel to shit is still, just that.
I know it’s gonna be bad but I hope it’s good
💞
Ijjaathi 🔥🔥
After I wasted years watching every episode just for it to end with that sh*tty final season, no thanks I'm done with GoT and anything related to that franchise.

All I want is got s7 and s8 with good story plot and ending
I wish they use Game of thrones soundtrack title credits
This is about the dragon wars, the founding dragon and the betrayal of the king who flees to an island of isolation?

Fingers crossed for this one. I love the GOT universe and hope this surpasses everyone's expectations.
Can't wait 😍😍
After the last season of GoT, I can only think they will mess things up. When GrrM was writing, the show was awesome. They day he stopped it all went awry.
no one cares anymore remake the last 2 seasons
Is that doctor who?
🐭
Hope this won't end up like season 8.
🐉🐉🐉🐉
Looking backwards for this show 👽👽
Geralt, is that you?
They turned one story to absolute shit.  Why not create another that's it from the start.  Perhaps they won't, but..........
Is this Dunk and Egg?
Anybody After game of thrones
Good luck trailer film
Anybody After game of thrones
Yes please!
Game of thrones is like ex and there’s no going back to that beotch
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but that three-headed dragon emblem should not yet exist, because that was created specifically for Daenerys, right?
It feels like Richard Madden's voice
India 🇮🇳 kerala🌴
Yessssss!!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 omfgggg
Is that Matt Smith?
This show leads to GoT which leads to Season8...
Black ppl in westeros.... I guess they disappeared when the dragons did.
Tbh the way the fucked up the last seasons  of GoT I don’t have big hopes…
Cool, hopefully you can redeem yourself after that complete joke of a final season you had before.
Ok why does everyone think they are gonna screw it up everything that was adapt in the og GOT was pretty great it only got bad when they started making up their own story this book arc is finished meaning it’s all adapted meaning it’s probably gonna be just as great as the first 5 season of GOT
Таргариены-негры это конечно что-то невероятное!
Cant wait to see them ruin this show too
George R.R Martin, Please Don't let disappoint us with the finale of this show!
The ending is gonna suck.
DROP IT NOWWWW
Khaalesi nerde la
Негры Таргариены. 🤣🤣🤣 Это край.
If I were in a theatre, I would have shouted...woooohooooo...yeaaahhhh...woooo
Should i give a damn? I just don't know anymore. GoT was oh so good.... until the violation.
Mushroom arrrgh
Mixed emotions. Love the universe but reminded of the horrible terrible blasphemous episodes after S8E3. Still hurts. Go down as some of the worst writing ever.
So this might be called " before the winter came ! "
Just keep and dumb and dumber out of it and it'll be just fine 😅🤣
Who are the producers and director?
Very Powerful looking forward to this
another good start ....and shitty ending ...
Not liking two of the casting choices, it's gonna have to have some explanations in the first season or something.
Im so excited for this woooo
I see HBO felt the need to preface the title with GoT, effectively making the title “Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon”. There’s no way that someone in 2022 isn’t going to know that HotD is connected to Thrones.  I’m a little worried that if HBO thinks it’s audience is that complacent, is the show going to be as dumbed down as the later seasons of Thrones?
Let's hope they don't fuck this up with a horrendous finale. Fingers crossed 🤞
I hope it's better than season 8.
Let's hope they don't fuck it up this time
why tho
Daaamn 🔥🔥🔥🔥😯
Okay maybe. I just hope the producers understood what made the success, and contributed to the downfall of the first series. Writing, writing, writing. It does not matter if it cosmetically looks the same as they original show. The original show failed itself when it became more interested in what it looked like, than telling a good story. It's great when a show looks good.. but if the writing sucks... it doesn't usually matter how good the acting is or how nice the set design. Tell.... a good... STORY!
Is D Benioff / D Weiss involved with this series at all? If they are then HBO can go screw itself, I am never watching anything involve those two clowns again.
socorroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Next Boom ... 💥 https://youtu.be/vZ-Dg0_oVR0 Out Now .. ♥🔥
Valerians are all white wtf this totally ruins the immersion
Please show more iconic landmarks that GOT didn't show and of course Storms End! So excited!!
Please, don't break my hype again
Firestarter
dare i allow myself to hope...?
Man, I hope Ramin Djawadi is composing the music for this series...
The Malfoys
Summer is coming!
Can someone invent time travel just so we can have our favorite actors from GoT in this one too?
Am I the only one who thinks it sounds like Ramsey did the voice over for this teaser !!!!!?
Let's baby ehhhhh clutch mode.
WE LOVE MATT SMITH
Team green.
Its going be a Banger that is until the last episode after that they get ful creative control to ruin the series
Another legendary tv series
Is this show connected to Games of Thrones  ?
Aren't Targaryens supposed to be exceptionally beautiful people ?
How does the trailer of the show called house of the dragon, about the targaryens who were dragon lords, doesn’t have dragons…atleast one…
https://youtu.be/ypaOSQRYE4s
I have yet to receive an apology for season 8
God I Hope you don’t SJW this Game of Thrones spin off.....
Dang. Matt Smith is a blonde now. Blondes are cool.
Looks good .....but plz just increase default  brightness
Matt smith aka the best doctor who love to see him back on big shows
You had at 11th doctor in a fantasy realm
Heck yaaaSss
Don't even care anymore
Add the GOT intro music and make goosbumps
മലയാളി എത്തിയോ എന്ന കമന്റ്‌ വന്നോ 🤣🤣
Please don't fuck it up like you did with game of thrones!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can’t wait to see how they fuck this one up
Why is the emblem three headed if it was 200 years before Dani?
lmao foh
هذي قبل عهد قيم اوف ثرونز ؟
please restore the greatness that GoT once had D:
Time to increase tv brightness again
Waiting
OMG
Egarly waiting 😍
Need more niggas!!!!!
I sincerely hope those two numb sculls who absolutely RUINED the final season of GOT, have NOTHING to do with this one!!!!
People didn’t hate the last season. We just hated the ending and how they screwed Jon Snow from killing the Knight King then taking the throne which was rightfully his.
Não fode minha vida não House Of The Dragon 😭😭😭
"Dreams didn't make us kings" umm except that's the only reason any of them escaped the doom of Valyria and became kings
https://youtu.be/IaMro453eaU
Cant wait 8 seasons of build up, leading to absolutly nothing.
Can't wait for the "Ohhhh, it makes sense now" moments
The hobbits of GAME OF THRONIOUS
Eu estou te esperando venha e me possoa house of the Dragon
I get that it may be done on purpose... but god damn all the main characters look inbred.
CARALHO MEU CU EU PRECISO ASSISTIR ISSO AGORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Where is dragon🙃
Malayali indo
Looking forward to seeing some hair bleaches from the show. The Silver Hair make them more distinctive!
#RestoretheSnyderverse
Just hope they actually have good swordfights. Combat in GoT was pretty dog ass.
HBO Max Series And Movies Sucks And that's a fact
Don't care about prequels, we know how it ends.
Matt Smith looks like a proper asshole, and that's fucking fantastic
Seeing Iron throne after all this years... Memories
I'm ready to get my feelings hurt again
Nice.. But HBO is way too overpriced for this nonsense.  Fleecing people in the middle of a pandemic, is just bad business.
While I’m cautiously optimistic, Blackfyre has me fangirling.
Yeah no thanks. You burnt everyone already.
Not gonna watch a show so they can F it up again
"200 Years Before the Season 8"
I have just started seeing GOT 4 DAY ago and they are making now 2nd part
Wooooooooo !
🐉
Wow am I NOT looking forward to this.  Brought to you by the guy who wrote "Rampage" and 2014's "Hercules,"  both epic timeless masterpieces...oh wait no, they were gigantic piles of shit.
Негрилл то набрали на все ключевые роли?
Fuuuuuucccckkkkkk ❤️
I like how everyone is getting excited for this show yet everyone hated the last season of GOT. What exactly do you people think is gonna be so different with this show?
Ah yes, the targaryens, white hair and blue eyes...
Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did...🔥
Honestly had no idea Matt Smith was in this
GoT's ending left such a bad impression that honestly I simply don't care about GoT anymore. Even if it's new writers, the excitement is gone.
This shit is gonna suck isn’t it
I’m still so disappointed with how GoT ended that it’s hard to be excited for this 😅
Season 7 wasn't enough to kill the show, uh?
well the most albino family in fantasy so lets get a black gay with dreadlocks does one get racialy annoyed? not at all. lorewise though... WHERE ARE THE PURPLE FUCKING EYES
HBO acting like they can compete with Lord of the Rings in 2022
Ah yes, the  Most Loyal friends of Targaryen's, House Blackryon... one of my favourite houses. As A Song of Ice & Fire fan... hopefully I can somehow delete the HBO fantasies out of my mindset. With  of course, more brainwashing, but not here, elsewhere...
The Many Saints of Newark was meh. But at least we still have Sopranos. This I'm not gonna watch. Waste of studio cash. Sopranos still a good show to watch on HBO. Snm. Curb too actually
Lame
ya era hora
when is that release at HBO GO😭
Eh hem….where is winds of winter???
Praying it’s not woke
Telugu lo release cheyandii
LETS GO!!!
Please release this show in Indian languages hindi we are very excited for this show come in hindi language so please release house of the dragon in Indian languages for your indian fans  thank you so much for this and all the best for this amazing show 👍 love for india 🇮🇳
Spoiler...Bran Stark ascends the thrown as "Bran the Broken". The final king.
Give us another terrible ending!
I wish they have nude scenes 😂more than game of thrones 😂
Looks shit
Надеюсь сценаристы те же, что и в 8-ом сезоне "Игры престолов"..........
Seems a Little too late, like I have zero hype. God, I miss the excitement and build up before a new GOT season.  There's nothing like it nowadays.
Doctor Who is back with his Time Machine!
Hope Jon Snow gets a cameo or more than that...
Yo chill
Can't wait to see all the older houses
This trailer is only missing one thing. WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?!
Dear producers and HBO  Please take all the time, effort and money to make this series a MASTERPIECE..and your joys will be endless.  Refuse that, rush it and make yet another mockery of a season like the finale of GoT...and i'll RAPE YOUR FUCKING CORPSE!
Well I sure as hell hope Benioff and Weiss didn't write this one, because they're two world class writing fuck ups
*CAN'T WAIT & I hope they don't build up something so good for a dumb ending like we witnessed before...* 😥
Bring it, I'm ready to be disappointed once again!
രോമാഞ്ചം❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where are the dragons 🐉
All the people bitching about the ending to season 8 - go watch another series!  E07 was epic, E08 wasn't perfect but wasn't a disaster. Danny was a bitch and needed to die
I hope these Targaryens know how to fight!
Finally the iron throne from the novels
Katta waiting 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just realized when alicenr hightower is running firward with a dagger thats littlefingers dagger! Makes sense itd be a couple centuries old
This is going to be a mess of a show and I can’t wait to watch.
This hurts to watch, because it is all about my favorite character’s ancestors. Daenerys deserved better, and why should we care about a show that we know ends badly in the long run? The showrunners of GoT were really shortsighted and hurt the whole series, past and present, when they did their little ‘ending.’
Is this from the same directors that made the last season of GOT?
This actually makes me want to do a marathon on GØT 😀
Goosebumps dude its freaking awesome
the dragon armor looks nice
Is this going to be the dance of dragons event?
House Targaryen: 🙋‍♂️ #Houseofthedragon 🔥🐉❤
Ребята да это просто балдеюка какая то
To be honest because we already know the history, it won’t be as good as GOT season 1-3.
I love matt smith
I'm the 1% who still haven't watched GOT yet. 😂😂😂
"Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did"
I miss medium funding game of thrones instead of 20 mil an episode. I think 10m per episode was perfect not too much leeway to do wetf you want.
I love how they have kept the background music like that of GOT. Brings back lots of memories!
Yall really fucked up the casting on this one matt smith is a great actor but he's no daemon & that's not the sea snake yall ruined the entire history of house velaryon for tokenism looks like yall learned nothing from the shitshow d&d made of got season 8
0:18 wait is that balerion?
and to know that this house got the most stupid ending ever
I CAN'T WAIT
This is gonna be good, season 7 & 8 were bad because the moved away from the source material. This is the other hand is from the books, even with a few tweaks and changes here and there, it's gonna be good
I wonder... how will you fuck up this series too?
The Witcher season 2 looks amazing
Seeing the iron throne and the throne room 200 years before is interesting, there’s no stained glass window like in game of thrones, it’s just a normal glass pane behind the throne.
Okay, I'm gonna bleach my hair right now...
Shame :(
Look the dudes Voice is Epic I love the part where he said Dragons made them Kings and Queen i think he was made for this part for real what an amazing talent he is and the rest of the cast so diverse in their own ways i cant wait for this to come out i am a fan of George RR Martin for Life!  * The costumes are amazing  The cast seems to be perfect from what i can tell  * The Set looks amazing
I like it. 💯
YESSSSSS!!!!!!
i wish they chose to do Aegon's conquest instead of DOD... we just saw the targs fall in GOT so it will be sad to see them fall again with dragons getting killed left and right
Does anyone involved in the GoT season 8 doing this?
200 years before, huh?
Just don't do a GOT season 8 on us.
After the finale of GoT , f**k them!
This looks shit
Whoever the lead actress is, she better have nude scenes
You took the lamest House in ASOIF and made it into a show lol
The trailer sucks. The casting is bad. After the garbage of season 8 I hope to see something good in the Got world, but I see nothing good in this. It's sad to see how far you have fallen Got.
That's... nice, call me again when there's a Dunk and Egg adaptation
Was dragons or the TARDIS let's be honest
I thought I was over Game of Thrones. But I m allowing another show to take over my life
Nice addition to the throne! In Condal and Sapochnik I trust!
I don't understand why there are multiple races portraying them when they're so obsessed with genetic purity...  Just seems like a reaction to the fact that GoT took place mostly within a European inspired continent and chose the cast accordingly. Just breaks immersion really.
Starring a white Bruce Lee.
IM SO FUCKING STOKED FOR THIS SHOW HOLY SHIT
Looking forward to watch this show. Except for the last season.
Please tread softly, I've been hurt before.
i watch it and remember the disappointing end of GoT ... that hurts
If Targarians are supposed to be good looking, why is Matt Smith playing one? O.O
How bout HBO remake the last season of GOT
In 200 years  their technology did not advance.
不錯，我從第一季追到第七季，第八季看完接龍家歷史剛剛好..
The last season of Game of Thrones, Season 5, was kinda rushed. After that, I remember having a fever dream that lasted years. But I'm fine now.
Sunfyre is going to look so s i c k
you know they know it's wrong to put black in,so they give it white hair rastaforever haheh
YES YES FUCKING YES🤯
not trying to be a jerk, i just want to know are people actually thinking this will turn out well after the s7/8? i feel that i have been hurt in a way no other franchise save maybe star wars has done in forever, and knowing the terrible ending to the Targaryen line, is there still hope for this?
I really really wanted to see a dragon
Oh hell yeah!! LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!
swag
I see why you did a prequel and not a sequel, HBO...  I heard you're not too good at endings.
Looking forward to 4 years of awesome followed by a linear decline for 4 more into the gutter that will probably be the last season?
who's here for matt smith!!!!??!!! I just want to see him haha
I’ve been hurt before and it will take some time and hard work to earn my trust again…
Whatever you bring upon the ashes of season 8 am ready to accept it ...
These people ruined the final season of GOT.
Nice try HBO you’re not going to fool me again.
No d and d to ruin it😌
The typo at the beginning pulled me out of the trailer , “A HBO” not “An HBO” who checks this stuff…  Maybe I am still bitter after S8 … yeah that what it is 🐉 🤕
Little known fact, the original words of house Targaryen weren't fire and blood, they were, let them seeee.
I am not sure how I feel. I really want to be excited for HOTD. Lets be honest, we will see dragons (Vhagar!), great political battles, and Matt Smith as the Rogue Prince Daemon Targaryen himself. However, knowing how it will end (I am not talking about how GOT end. I mean the end of the Dance), I hesitate to watch it. Do I really want to like Rhaenyra and Daemon, knowing how they will end up?   I usually do not have issues with prequels, but HOTD really challenge me in this aspect. I think I will wait and see whether watching the show will worth the inevitable heartbreak in the end.
black targaryen alert!!!!!!!!!!!
Not sure if they just picked the most unflattering scene ever..but not a fan of Rhaenys so far.
hype is real
*obligatory season 8 still left a bad taste in my mouth* I already have HBO Max so I may as well give it a try.
Please tell me DandD have nothing to do with this.
I really want to see 💕
... weak and generic.
Eitaaaa
Hope this don't get spoiled like GOT season 8
Who would be looking forward to this after the last few seasons of the show adapted from books that never finished? Throw it in the trash. Shit is unwatchable/readable now.
Honestly, I don’t trust it.  The North remembers.
So they had pretty much no minorities in Westeros, but now there are a ton in the prequel?   GTFO.
HBO you better not fck with me. after that last season you're on thin ice.
I wonder if this show will be closer in quality to Game of Thrones in the beginning, or the end.
Fallow me plz
nice!!
Not a fan of prequel series because it dulls the amount of surprise twists. The original was able to tells its story just fine, so we know that the world doesn’t end in this series. Only suprises will be family/house drama and dragon shit. I’ll still watch but I wish they didn’t only dip 200 years in the past.
I can't wait to see how they screw this one up when they get tired of producing the show.  Just like GOT
Wow Finally we have medicine to cure got s8 wounds.
What they gone do ruin this one too ?! LMFAO
Alright, I will give House of the Dragon a chance!
Holy Shit!! I can't wait!
HYPEEEEEE
Well, at least this show doesn't have big shoes to fill. It possibly can't do any worse than GOT.
I have several complaints and questions
Omg!! 😱😱😱😱
oh I hope there's a Karen Gillan cameo in one of the seasons.
This is being produced by the director of some of the greatest episodes of the original series. NOT D&D
All I will say is         valar morghulis
Damn I was hoping this was the new Vikings show based when the first come to the Americas.
The doctor doing some made shit man
This looks very good!!! 🔥🔥I hope they don't fuck this up!!!  I miss GOT❤
Super Excited
Isaac Hempstead Wright better make a comeback in some form.
Well the slim shady hair color is about to make a comeback.
Better have a good ending…. Lol

(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
I dont know who needs to hear this but you gat to stop saving all your money, invest some if you really want to gain financial freedom❤......
Its already look better than the last season of got lol
the witcher, geralt  is also a targaryen
targaryen rastaman ok
They definitely look like a bunch of invest witchers HAHAHAAAAA
Wish they didn't ruin this, like they did on GOT
that's basically admitting "goodness didn't make us winners; the atomic bomb did"
Matt Smith where is his tardis
Let's hope this series doesn't "Drag-on!" huh, huh... I'll see myself out.
Something about this doesnt feel right lol
What is up with Ramsay Bolton being narrator lol ?
Whenever a Coin is born God flips a targeryen
Should I risk my time.... Thinking
Omg omg omg omg I'm panicking 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Stop the ''but the last got season sucked'' bs.. We all gona watch it... so sushhh
😍😍😍😍
Absolutely no interest in watching this knowing already they Targ's all die out in the end.
I hope HBO learned their lesson with the last few seasons of GoT.
Who the fk cares? Bb you did us DIRTY. No thanks. GOT was like s3x without the 0. Not interested in your sloppy second s
You had me at House of the Dragon (Targaryen forever!), stayed for Matt Smith. <3 <3 <3
If this is good, I might forgive GoT season 8.
well, they can't ruin it twice, can they?
0:53 ...I thought they were done with hunger games
Are you guys done bitching yet?? We told you they wrapped up the series quickly to begin the spin offs but y'all couldn't stop crying over spilled milk long enough to see the pot of gold at your feet.
This gave me game of thrones vibes
So… on a scale from 1 to Targaryen, there’s bound to be hella incest.
First fix ur season 8...😒
What's the Duke of Edinburgh doing here?!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Wait....okay so they're making a more book accurate iron throne canon in the prequel. That's....genuinely neat.
I'm not sure if I'm excited after hearing: Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did. So they don't have dragons anymore? Or they are small (and people now have the courage to fight the white wigs)   I mean didn't they say in GOT: Dragons don't exist anymore for hundreds of years now. And even if they still have them in this series. Didn't someone say the dragons became smaller and smaller  because one day they just kept them as pets in cages?  I just can't remember if it was 200 years before or longer. I guess I'm just gonna have to watch the whole serie again to find out💪🤣
0:38? WTF? Is this netflix? Black in fantasy?  OMG...
Meh still salty about season 8
🖤
FUCK IT!!! After Season 7 and 8 of GTO every interesst in this Universe is gone! This Shit can not reverse the Damage!
looks so lame man... House Targaryen is so close to my heart but this looks so ...meh... and that actor? as Rhaegar?  LMFAO.
Series excelente
I wish I saw some dragons.
Ive kinda gotten over holding grudges, so I am looking forward to this but also cautiously optimistic.
looks gay...like REALLY gay
MATT SMITH
Watch how Matt Smith will only be in it for two episodes 😭😭😭😭
I wasn't too excited for this prequel.. completely changed my mind, LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!
Omg I'm so excited
Fuckinh crazy
Should’ve had this teed up after GOT. Not as interested.
I hope Ramin Djawadi is still there
Oh my fucking god.
Did anyone else see Merida half way through?
Be same story lines as orginal one, (like evey new show /movie,)  & HBO they knew those pair idiots killed it on season 8… “we bring something new they forgot about game of thrones”
Countdown to Kevin Smith crying... 3... 2... 1...
KD OS DRAGÃOOO
Fire and blood
HBO Max is on fire!
Time for normies to hop on the train once again
Okay, fine, but if any of you start naming your ugly kids after characters again, I'll lose my f'ing mind.
i dont care bro. and im not gonna watch. we already know the shitty ending. you fucked it up for perpetuity.
I LOVE MATT SMITH!!!!!!!! MAN CRUSH
No. The North remembers.
Please let this air January 1 2022! I need my fix!
Put your money where your mouth is and make the first episode free because I'm not buying on faith alone anymore.
https://youtu.be/GYh83x7jrmg
This show's source material and GoT have horrible similar endings and I hate it already bc somehow fcking Alicent is a redhead and I can just tell they're going to hype her up. Ew. I'm not here for miss better than everyone to look down her nose at literally everyone. All. Over. Again.
❤️❤️❤️
HBO Please with all my heart, do not rush in any way.  No matter how long the production takes, I want it to be perfect.
https://youtu.be/BWnYkd6lx1g
Lets hope that after 8 seasons they don't decide to ruin the thing.   GoT was like watching a great race. Then, while the winner is on the final lap, they stop 5 feet before they finish line, pull down their pants and just take a shit on the track and end up losing the race.  Please do not fuck this up.
Valar Morghulis
lolz dey didn even use da real chik in dis. an where is jon snow!!1!! or dwarf guy!1!!!1!
Do David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have any part in this?!?!??!?! If so then NO ONE in the right mind should touch it. Those two need to be SHAMED for what they did to the best show on TV.
Yes
Yes
So... Prolonged incest relationships may cause the change of race. Got it.
I LITERALLY JUST BAWLED MY EYES OUT
NOBODY CARES
Hindi dubbed
Hopefully they don't screw up this one like GOT
I’m still mad what y’all did to the final, but I’m excited ig.
Nah sorry…game of thrones had killed any chances these spin offs had.
Лучше переснимите последний сезон и продлите сериал.
Please don't disappoint. I will think that S7 and S8 were cancelled before watching this
Don’t ruin it like  first show, please and thank you.
Finally the miracle were happens❤
Oh jeez
HBO, please take your time with this show. We don't want a season every year. We want a good story, with a decent ending.
OMG 🔥🔥🔥😱 06/10/2021
The book's arc they're going to adapt is finished already. This time, there is no excuses.
That last quote is already historic
I well.... Who is writing and directing.... Cause I can only take so much disappointment
FISH FINGERS AND CUSTARD!!!  I WILL NEVER FORGET!!!
I am going to be watching so much tv next year. House of the Dragon, Lord of the rings series, book of Boba Fett, Obi Wan Kenobi, Andor ... and there's probably more I haven't listed.
might be hard to watch this knowing how shitty the story ends
Am sure there were no black targarians,   diversity is taken to far
PODE VIR SÉRIE DO MILÊNIO 😫❤️
D&D aren't involved?! There is hope! Count me in!
House of the dragons. Omg. Where are the dragons? >_<
Now just don’t do what you did with the last season…
🖤🖤🖤
I hope they will redeem on how GOT ended
"The GoT franchise is beyond recovery. It's reputation is damaged beyond repair. HBO just needs to put a fork in it" Teaser trending #1 on youtube with 5.1 million views in a day. I guess people have lost some of the anger lol. Or maybe it's just morbid curiosity.
ahhhhhh
I feel like we can be pretty hopeful, it really was all Dan and Dumbass Dave to blame for the gaffe of the last seasons of the main show. The source material is solid and has a broad amount of ways you can adapt it, I think the will do fine. The actors are all reputable as well.
Are the makers of this gonna get bored and quickly write an end to it like they did GoT?
0:24 knight of Mirra Sword comfirmed lol cant wait for this show :0
All I preach is caution, my good small folk!
GOT Beginning 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please say that D & D are NOT writers for the show....
I’m not falling for this crap again… 🙄
I expect some good time travel memes out of this.
Iron Throne looks a lot cooler
Nah .....
Don't die, just promise myself.
The question is if the GOT can get any lower than where it already is? 👀
Is the narrator Ramsey Bolton?
My life is complete again
DRACARYS
Docteur retourne à la box
Not going to lie fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on you! that adage and vibe I'm  getting now and knowing how it this story ends with a bloody cripple that didn't earn or is worth anything on his on merits,  makes me want to not waste my time on something where the hopes/dream of the characters that i fell in with and  family of the character and how their family lets them down and backstabs them. in one word SUCKS!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
This will make daenerys even better and will make her arc in season 8 even worse.
Damn it HBO you found my weakness, Matt Smith.
What r the chances that this won't suck as bad as season 8....
Yes! 💖💖💖
Nooooo
Maybe just stop at Season 7 this time. Just to be safe.
Sorry, in 2022 I still won't be recovered from the awful GOT ending. Maybe in ten years ahead. Maybe NEVER.
I can't wait for two amazing first seasons, two regular and a horrible finale
My Body is ready!
Who asked for a prequel wheres Arya Stark
Thank you, HBO Max!
I am actually not interested in Game of thrones anymore after that finale
Wow, 😆 all of the game of thrones channels commenting.
So when is he going to finish the damn book?
This series will be shite. Just like the last two seasons of Game of thrones and George will never finish the series. Game of thrones is dead
OMFG CANT WAIT
The show runners ruined Game of Thrones with the last season. I’m never trusting this.
Here for it and hoping that it doesn't go out the way GOT did.
remember Taiwan it's not Hawaii!  none of your business!  it's not your problem!
If it’s written by D&D again and flopped hard like last seasons of GoT,  ISTG …
In my life wait for this moment
Yawn
We all know how it ends, in a pile of shit
People : GOT is the best TV series i have ever seen George RR Martin: hold my song of ice and fire
Is this connected to the shit show we all witnessed a few years ago or is this a complete reboot of that world?
Corlys Velaryon is a black guy ? WTF
Oh man! i have soo much doubtful thoughts on this! I hope it delivers something different than the previous one and don't give shitty plot or being bate and switch kinda show.. so much to say but i hope they don't use our nostalgia for got to make us pay for it.
Ah yes Lord Corlys Velaryon a pale white bleach blonde Valyrian character played by a black guy. I can't wait to see the Zulu remake played by Chris Hemsworth. Can we stop this woke stuff that doesn't care about the fans or George R R Martin. Real fans like the history, geography, and regional realism. Could of casted him easily as the bastard Valyrian with summer isle blood.
I dont see dragons skulls in the throne room
https://youtube.com/shorts/dUW0vW87bDE?feature=share
why are they black
Looks like more anti-White garbage.
https://youtu.be/aJulFLrPAP8
Soooo hyped ... 🔥
I will not be watching at all until this show wraps and manages to finish at least 10 times better then the GoT debacle.
Waiting for this only 😢🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can't wait🔥
I want to say this looks promising especially if the story is like Game of Thrones's Knights of the Old Republic but I'm assuming the show isn't going as epic as the trailer makes it look like.
Reads:  "D&D won't be involved. Martin will be though. "  Okay,  I'm interested.
Super hype!
Imagine Chris Hemsworth in the leading role with his long white hair.
House of inbreds. Looking forward to seeing it in action ;)
I wonder if this will be any good.  There was a noticable (to me, anyway) decline in the quality of "Game of Thrones" once the show ran out of George R.R. Martin's finished stories to use as source material.  Martin's story was the greatest thing about the show, and how much of Martin's writing will be in this prequel series?  If the answer to that question is "not a lot" then hopes/expectations should be tempered accordingly.
They better show the blue frozen zombies and give them a good chance. They hyped them up so much in GOT just for them to be killed off in 2-3 episodes
Please release HBO max India
I don't know if I'm ready to love again... I was hurt too much before.
https://youtube.com/shorts/dUW0vW87bDE?feature=share
no way
❤️❤️❤️
Que emoción !!🔥🔥
Not excited to see Rhaenyra meet her fate but am stoked to see this over all.
HBO - After Season 7 and 8 of Game Of Thrones - go feck yourselves
Yes! Can’t wait 😀
the best Serie , i love it so much…melhor notícia que tive hoje …😲😮👏🏻 ⚔️🐺
I wish they added some Targaryen themed music for this trailer because I think it was the best music in GOT. But omg I’m excited for this🔥🔥😩
"before the fall of the throne" HBO got self-aware.
🔥🔥
Good grief, black House Velaryon?  The wokeness just won't stop.  SMDH
What's Ramsay Bolton doing here 😂
I can't wait to see Balerion.
"The king kinda forgot about the other dragons"
孟子曰：“以力假仁者霸，霸必有大国。以德行仁者王，王不待大。汤以七十里，文王以百里。以力服人者，非心服也，力不赡也。以德服人者，中心悦而诚服也，如七十子之服孔子也。诗云：‘自西自东，自南自北，无思不服。’此之谓也。”  孟子提出的王道精神，是中国政治哲学的一个大原则。自孟子提出这个观念以后，中国历代的政治思想均以此作为政治的大原则。  孟子说“以力假仁者霸”，以权势及武力为手段，而又假借仁义为口号的，这种政治就是“霸道”。中国历史自尧、舜、禹三代以后，政治路线变了，所行的差不多都是霸道。而行霸道的先决条件，必须自己先能成为一个大国，也就是说国家本身的军事力量要强大，经济力量要雄厚，人民要众多，领土要广阔，等等。必须先具备这些厚实的国力，霸道才能行得通，所以孔子、孟子都认为，自周朝以来，王道就开始逐渐衰微了。孔子在《礼记》的《礼运篇》中，说到人类文化衰微的演变，就感叹后世已失去了王道。世界大同思想体现于《礼运篇》中的一段，描写王道政治普遍实施以后理想的社会状况。他说，中国在上古时候的人类社会，就是这种大同世界的“太平”盛世；等而下之，王道的精神变了，王道的政治也没有了，但还可以致“升平”的社会；再等而下之，便是衰乱之世了。而孟子在这里，就更加强调失去大同世界理想、失去王道精神以后的政治，都只是假借仁义的“霸道”而已。但是他为霸业下了一个定义——霸业必须具备一个强大的力量来行使治权。然而，纵使是一个具有强大力量的政权，要想图强称霸，还是要假借仁义之名，利用仁义做它的号召。换言之，霸道的政权、霸道的君主、霸道的大国，如果不借仁义为名，还是不行，不能成为霸。历史上这类事例很多，一定要两者掺和来用，虽然有政权、有实力，但也还要借助仁义这块招牌。  例如十九世纪以后，西方政治思想所标榜的“自由民主”，表面听上去无可厚非，其实真正的“自由民主”也就是中国传统所讲的做到“王道”精神的一个渠道。可是直到现在为止，全世界的国家民族中哪个真正做到了“自由民主”呢?即使有，也不过是假借自由民主之名而行霸权之实，不也正是孟子所说的“以力假仁者霸”吗？
Matt Smith! Brilliant casting.
AHHHHHHH YES FINALLY A WILL TO LIVE!   😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉
After the way they screwed us with the ending of Game of Thrones, why invest time on another of their shows?
No . why would we even watch after ‘ you’ (the directors )betrayed us with such a disappointing end 🖕🏼, go to hell ☺️
No thanks. Stopped caring after the final season.
So disappointed they didn't choose to narrate the Blackfyre Rebellion
I don't see asian valyrian representation there.
I am here to see Matt Smith saying to a dragon, "Oh, what a beauty!"
YES! HBO is back baby!
Same set BTW
AAAAA 😍😍
I am done wasting my time with GOT
Anakin: As long as it’s not D&D writing this show the fans should be fine right?....right???
People forgot about season 8?
Why does that dragon have 4 legs?
I hope there is a document that legally bans D&D from getting in a 10 km radius of this production.
Really? After the clusterfuck that was Season 8?
Looks amazing guys
So this won’t come on Netflix or hotstar?
I want to be upset because of Season 8...... but I'm still f***ing excited to get back to it
Yeah no thanks not after the shitshow that was GoT. Fuck that.
So my husband's new Lucius Malfoy wig for Halloween wont go to waste !
Please don't ruin this like the last half of G.O.T.
omg i cry
Finally! I have never given up on you GOT now House of Dragon I am ready! I loved the way GOT ended they way it should have! I think ppl forget GOT was the Starks story this whole time!!! Now for those who love House Targaryn will get what they have been waiting for! LETS  GO! Still a Stark at heart can't change that though lol!
Looks awesome, can't wait to not watch the last season...
😠 ABOUT DAMN TIME!! Thought I was going to have to watch TWD👀🤢😂
Don't let DnD near this Series
Guys, we get it, you didn't like season 8! Jesus Christ, y'all realise this is made by different people, right?
i have high ass expectations — this better not please then disappoint us
Legendary series💯 GOT
Everybody be safe out there ❤️
lol
Let's hope this is more like the first GoT seasons and less like season 8...
Can't wait for another great show that has the worst ending possible.
I gotta feeling the Hightowers will be my early favorite characters of the show. Olivia's Alicent looks to be the protagonist. Not Emma's Rhaenyra. And Rhys Ifan as Otto Hightower has a background in comedies.
Hype
Man this is gonna suck a$$
I hope D&D didn’t direct this
The Lost Apollo Mission - Apollo-Venus Flyby - Sr2 https://youtu.be/_7eCFWgvSGc
Who's the director
OOOOMMMMMMGGGGGGGGG
We’re so easy to forget the pain we endured 😂
Still Waiting For Season 8
Can't wait!
Looks EXACTLY like Ridley Scott's The Last Duel..... like they got his unused footage. Boring. (and I loved Game of Thrones)
"Dragons are Cool"
Ooohh, here's what I hope... that this is really good for like oh 7 years or so and then BAM! It just leaves you questions, tears and a light case of suicidal ideation.    Good times.
Let's see if this GOT sequel is good
I hope HBO understands that it’s the dialogue and interpersonal conflicts that make story telling.  Bot stylized BS and intrusive modern day themes or references.
GOT hurt me so bad with it’s ending I’m actually having trouble being excited for this :/ don’t want to get invested again
Can anyone tell if this series will also have aegon the conqueror 🔥
Literally only care that the writing team is different lol. Which I’m happy to see that it has changed!
Can't wait 🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤠
Too bad it’s connected to Game of Thrones. Instant Downvote
They did a little better the throne
Why is this trailer being released on hbo max account
Hindi dubbed krna
I couldn't get into game of thrones due to much of the violence... I hope this one is different cause I'd love to watch it
We also want the beginning with the children of the forest,the first men & the creation of the night king
Hope hbo will make a series about robert's rebellion too.
OMG 😲
Remember ya'll? She HURT you!!
I can't wait for them to ruin this concept
This puts the tease in teaser trailer, there wasnt even one dragon and im all in 🔥🔥🔥👑🤙👶🥚
Ehhh GOT is a dead franchise.. HBO just wasted it’s money here
What did I miss?
Dragons aeeda sir….
The North remembers.... Season 8's Ending
I'm waiting ranya yousef
Things that we do for love
I wanted to see at least 1 dragon in this teaser but still I’m so excited 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am hoping this will have better finale
Ok I'm down, everyone looks cool plus Dan and Dave we kind of of forgot about about good writing producers are not here to fuck things up.   If this does well lets hope Hbo considers redoing the original series but this time staying accurate to the source material. Fingers crossed.
Lol this reminds me of when my ex wants to come over and I get excited, only for her to be coming over to burn my fucking house down while wielding a rusty, broken knife or some shit. In other words, I CANT FUCKING WAIT
Dreams Didn't Make Us King's, Dragons Did....! Can't Wait! What a perfect start.🤯🧑‍🦳
https://youtu.be/r_eJdU7pGVk
I wanted  to a dragon at least in this teaser but still I’m so excited 🔥🔥🔥🔥
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1-7QyznrcwYIvLJskpMvp5DQpNWi-dQ1
Уххх ля, ждем!!!)
I think I'll watch this.
House of the Dragon is going to be lit. And the light is coming from every bleach blonde in the room.
So long as Dumb and Dumber aren't involved, I'm fine with this.
LETS FUCKING GO.
So what part of Targaryen history are they goin with pre doom of valeria aegon conquest or dance with dragons and can someone explain to where the black Targaryen came from it seem like a woke add in and I’m black by the way
If you're shallow, the lead actress (Emma D'Arcy) is not quite as attractive as Emilia Clarke. And Matt Smith is no Kit H. Olivia Clarke is beautiful. She has the eyes of Rose Byrne with a hint of Rachel Leigh Cook.
HBO: "Remember how expensive and time consuming those 3 dragons were" VFX Companies: "Yeah jeez - that was a nightmare" HBO: "Yeah we're gonna need like 50 more now"

Why am I listening to this trailer like a soundtrack?🤣
You know if you just remade season 8, this would be a definite success? 🤣
Hmm looks like the same stuff... will be skipping this one. 'fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me'.

There’s boutta be a new hair style trend
Don't hurt us again HBO i cant deal with it after how bad season 8 was
That semi book accurate throne though.....
Here we go again
plz dont end this show like game of thrones.... with a shitty ending.
Am i the only one that after watching this i am only thinking of the half-drawn horse?
Unless George is attached & is actually being listened to... I dunno 😒
Loved the ending of game of thrones it made me cry that John had to choose honor over love
I forgot all about this being a thing. Redeem the ending of Game of Thrones with this series pls
I will only give this a shot because Matt Smith.  GoT was a big let down.
Well....I'll watch it.
They weren't kidding about teaser.....not even enough information to even get a hard on off of.
Looks like the Doctor cosplaying as Geralt of Rivia.
Ual😍
Barristan Selmy was hardly in GOT and loved that character. He died like a true bad---!!! I also loved Stannis Baratheon. He killed a dozen dudes in the Battle of Blackwater while at the front line.
THIS IS SO EXCITING
What are you up to Doctor? 😅
So targaryens are black and Asian now?
Really banking on people's awful memory on this one eh? Why would any rational person watch the prequel to a story that goes nowhere?
Game of Thrones has the deepest mythology. Deeper than Star Wars,Star Trek, and LOTR. I had at least a dozen characters I enjoyed. Many side characters like Bronn, Tormund, and Davos. We need more likeable ones like them.
What is the relationship with this to GOT? Does this take place before the show? After? Or what's up with it?
nah unlike dany who fOrGoT aBoUt tHe iRoN fLeET  I still haven't forgot that horrible ending of the best tv series potentially ever created but got absolutely wasted by Dumb and Dumber because they wanted that sweet Disney Star wars money. What a shame!
AYO WE WAS DRAGON RIDERS N SHEIT
HBO, how about you fixed the BS in season 8 first
I am apprehensive. They catastrophically  F'd off the Finale of GOT .... IDK if I can take such an emotional letdown again.  Sheer Disappoinment..LOL
Remember, remember the S8 of the Nonsense, The Gunpowder Treason and Plot,
I am unbelievably hyped
omg?????????????????????
Let's hope the writers don't make the same mistake again. We must love these characters. We will have our personal favorites to root for to survive at the end. It's kinda like sports. You have teams to root for.
Still waiting for the book.
why is corlys black
Jesus fuck if that black guy is somehow any part valyrian ... well I won't do anything because there is nothing to do.  Its as immersive as making Asshai by the shadow an island off the coast from kings landing.  It makes no sense.  If he is anything besides a noble visiting from the summer islands its total bullshit. Next time spike Lee makes a movie let's make sure to add a white Canadian selling cds on the street corner in Harlem.
Let's hope they don't fuck it up.
Yes, Game of Thrones did not end well. The second to last episode was the WORST episode of the series. Dany turned. You can watch the script reading reaction and you can see the actors weren't exactly pleased.
Meanwhile George is saying we driving him crazy
Se prendió está mierda!!!
Please come in india
And the two shitty writers of GoT are long gone.
Let’s hope they don’t rush this one
Season 8 people.. season 8.   Remake that thing.. because if is not is all worthless.
House of the Dragon is going to be another water cooler-type of show we can react to weekly. YouTube reactors have another great hit to talk about. Most important are the characters. We need to love them.
given how GOT went, I expect nothing from this.
Can't wait for this!!!
Going to be an epic return to form
As long as D&D don't come anywhere near this I'll watch it. It'd be a shame this was ruined too. I'll give it a chance.
‘An’ HBO original series? Someone’s getting fired
مشترك جديد لما بييجي الاشعار ده بيفرحني يفرحك ربنا
This show is going to be another winner and our GOT for this 2020s decade like GOT did for the 2010s. Can run until 2029 and become the most pirated and talked about show of all-time. Great for the reaction community.

Hello, I'm the Doctor... Basically, RUN!
y tho?
They are going to fuck this story up so hard *grabs popcorn*
Is it written by the same morons that butchered the GOT series ?
Calling it now. Will start off strong then drop in quality with a horrible finale due to lackluster writing. Not looking forward to this at all
Can't wait to see all of the african american, korean, transgender targaryens!
I barely even feel excited seeing something spawn from the GoT Universe after watching last few seasons.
For the best trailer breakdown, watch Erik Voss from New Rockstars. He explained it the best like he did for that MCU timeline.
Best thing about this is there's no books to ruin (the show didn't really. They did well til they ran out of books actually but that's the only reason they did good at all) and different show runners
The Targaryens literally incest to make them pure-blood, and there is a black actor in the house. No disrespect to the actor, but this is weird. What do you think if let an Asian cast a Targaryen? At least I think it's gonna be weird.
We want sequels not prequels!
Just cast natural blonde actors for this show. Hire even Gwen Stefani who is a natural brunette. My personal favorite natural blondes includes Emma Stone and Margot Robbie.
FIRE AND BLOOD
Hopefully David and Dan are banned from contributing.
This world is dead to me. Not going back
Gods. Kings. Fire. Blood.    And Incest.  LOTS of incest.
#dragonOUT
Dr. Who had a really Tolkien phase didn't he?
Me two years ago: "That show is dead to me."  One teaser later: "Ok I'm ready to be hurt again please."
I’m not getting burned again. Give us dragon 8 fixed before this. We need a real ending
I want to get excited, but after season 8 of GoT I'm so careful.
Looks like it will be amazing.👍
It's like you were in love for years and walked in on your lover getting railed by the mailman. You ended things and moved on with your life. Once you finally manage to put the nightmare behind you, she texts you and wants to talk and try to start over. Promising she's not drinking anymore and that things will be different. Part of you wants to take her back, but you know the magic you once had is now gone. Things are different now and you've changed. No matter what she says or does, the love you used to feel for her is just not there anymore.
Shin Megami Tensei V is going to be badass!
The low bass hum really hits different
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The first show ended poorly, but man it was an amazing ride getting there.  Lets see how this goes!
#restoresnyderverse
Mark Paul Gosselaar would be perfect for this show. Ser Zack Morris has been bleaching his hair blonde for over 30 years now.
You couldn't pay me to watch this. After the wasted hours spent watching the original and the fiasco of an ending, I'll never again watch anything related to GOT.
How many seasons did we watch just to be disappointed last time?  Not paying for dissapointment again.
So instead of developing the last season more they doing this instead
The Dr. is in
Now that we know all it took was one stab into the night king for the long night to end, the whole world just feels aimless.
Zero content. Doesn't bode well for the writing.
Olivia Cooke from Ready Player One as Alicent Hightower is holding the dagger that Littlefinger used to try to frame Tyrion and the one Arya used to kill Littlefinger and Night King.
I'm so hyped for this!
I hope this show will be more like seasons 1-4 of game of thrones seasons 5-7 sucked and 8 was just a horrible joke
I need a drink
This looks very promising
Fuck this. Never again after what they did to GoT.
😍 I will wait for you my future queens! 🤣
It's hard to forget the last season of GoT and still hope for good...
I am excited for this but I think it is funny that 200 years in the past and its as if it was 200 years in the future. If you look at how far we have come in 200 years. in this universe they are all a bit dumb if they not learned anything.
If we are gonna do capitalism, we at least deserve 20 HBO dragons.
Is that Balerions skull at 0:17?
Not watching it. Why bother. Season  8 ruined everything. The ASOIF universe is dead.  No point wasting any time after we know how shitty is the ending of the whole thing.
🔥🔥
We'll see....
some of the castings leave me scratching my head.
Please don't fuck this up
Targaeryans were black?
who are the directors of this?
FFS Fix S8 first. this is just building on a smoking ruin
No Starbucks cups were hurt during this filming
Why valiryans is black?
No thanks. We all know how it all ends, so no point in watching.
“Come back baby, it’ll be different this time”
Eh
Sorry, you ain't pulling me back in.  Nope, not gonna happen.  I know how the final story ends thanks to that dumpster fire of season 8.  So, what's the point?
OMFG !!! please don’t be like GOT and try to make it good with ending. thanks. ps: can’t wait !
WE WUZ TARGARYENS N SHEEIT
lmfao the royals are all black of course I'm also assuming the white people in the show will be white supremacists etc, Western American politics seems to be a cancerous plague.
Can't wait to pirate this and see how they fuck it up
I’m curious…
i farted so hard seeing this pop up at work on the toilet
I don't care what costume and outfit you put him in, Matt Smith is NOT handsome.
bro they released this trailer the day I finished game of thrones
YES 🐉🐉🐉
Well, at least the costumes will look beautiful
Can not wait for this!! Had goosebumps watching just the teaser.
DON’T FUCK THIS UP
Unpopular opinion: GoT season 8 was just underwhelming but not awful. Therefore, I have no problem with rewatching the show or the upcoming spin-offs like this one. Am I the only one who thinks this way, or is anyone else on the same train?
#9 ON TRENDING 🇩🇿🔥
Holy shitttttessss
I love it when the notification shows up “someone likes your comment” and “and you have a new subscriber” it always makes my day ♥️
No.... no nonononononoooooo. Not even going to. No... Because just like the North... I remember.
a la vergaaaaaa !!!! no puedo esperar al 2022 😲
200 years before? These guys should have developed a gun or something. Still using swords
Choose your plan--If you live in the U.S, otherwise the rest of you can fuck off. - *HBO Max*
I like that the show is inclusive but find it a little odd that The Blacks are the only black people I see...with bleached white hair no less...
This looks amazing! I love the Fire and Blood book, so I can’t wait to see this!
OMGOMGOMGOMFONGOMF
did you guys write the ending yet?  I don't want to waste my time on a show created by people who will ruin the ending just because they are getting another offer.   I will pass, thank you.
Stupid. Not the Dance of Dragons to cheap out on cgi. The way season 8 ended, I'll leave this toxic shit for the diehards.
Am I the only person that thinks Henry Cavill would have been an awesome Targaryen?
Nobody wants this.  We want a remake of GOT season 7 & 8 that you guys fucked up. You destroyed the work of 6 years, you destroyed what was gonna be the best show in history. Fuck off HBO.
MDSSS 😍🇧🇷
WE WUZ TARGS AND SHIET
AMAZING
Legendly
House Velaryon looks amazing.
Ainda dá tempo de concertar o final de GOT .
Too much of a good thing is bad. Too much of a good thing that has already gone spoiled is terrible. Stop
Hope this does more for GoT than The Many Saints Of Newark did for The Sopranos.
Season 8 was crap and the books aren't done, George... but OK.
Gotta be honest, after the last seasons travesty, I can't get excited about it second time around.
I’m still mad at you for the series finally … I won’t get back into this
Omg!!!!
Мда.. Негры с белыми дредами..надеюсь гомосексуалистов и лесбиянок не забудут..
I'm going to say to HBO the same thing my Dad says to me when I'm about to try something new.... DON'T SCREW THIS UP LIKE LAST TIME.
Hmmm. Expect same format?  Great from the start nearing the finish line... then watch them sh*t themselves in the end? Got it. 😬
Th doctor looks a little different here…
This trailer focused almost entirely on the blacks. I wonder if the next trailer will focus more on the greens
At least we already know how this one ends...
I like the new throne, but I hope they find a way to justify why it’s changed design. If you look closely at the various shots of it, particularly the one during the feast, it looks like there have simply been more swords added to the rear of the seat, behind where the back swords stuck up in the original show. It’s made the crest of the throne about a foot taller and more irregular in shape, in addition to the new swords now scattered around on the floor.
They got the waitress and doctor who in this mf 🤣 I can't take it serious
0:37 holy shit that armor!!!! Daemon and Cole fighting!
hbo…you have ALL the source material for this. so PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO IT RIGHT
I hope to gawd dam they don't screw this up. Game of thrones was awesome until they quit caring about it.
Amazing how a family of inbreds still manages to get minority races scattered in...
In the end everyone goin crazy n die !!
Dany kinda forgot about the iron fleet... but we certainly haven't forgotten about that...
Weak trailer. Yall couldnt even give us a decent end to the original show. Why are you making this?
Don't have any interest in this after they butchered got .
I'll be honest, after Game of Thrones I'm not even excited for this. Even if the show runners are different the last show left such a bad taste for this franchise
we were targariens n shiet
This show's weekly question will be not who's gonna die this episode, but rather which Dragon will.  😎
Everything that happens in this show will be the will of Bran...  And we already know that it all goes to crap so.....   ... So what's the point?
Will this have wildlings
Looks better than The Many Saints of Newark
Look, you just don't understand. Yes I got hurt last time, but things will be different this time. They've cleaned themselves up and also they don't have another prospect lined up. So this will be better, they swear.
Wasnt it 300 years?
Gets canceled after first season,meh.
Nope!
"You know I love you baby..that last time was just a mistake." - HBO pretending we will forget about the last season of GOT lol!
This is gonna have a really bad ending
The alcoholic cord correlatively pull because craftsman meteorologically entertain until a dynamic raven. gabby, mature semicolon
My rebound is here! 😓
Fool me once......
Remeber when these used to be books lol
Same people that bashed on s7 & s8 are the same people that are going to be lined up subscribing to max as soon as it drops no loyalty or shame these days how bout just appreciate what DB & DnD did by having the vision of bring this massive story to life if it wasn’t for them two we would never have had the show to begin with
Ice Launclaw Heartsbrane
https://youtube.com/shorts/xC6JkaOFUXU?feature=share
As I was flying my dragon around I just "kind of forgot" about House of the Dragon
I didn't really watch GOT, but this had me at Matt Smith
Can't wait to see this love Matt Smith as an actor.
As long as DB Weiss and David Benioff are no where near any of the production this is gonna be awesome. I’m backing this up with George RR Martin being exec producer, as long as he has some footing in this it should be safe.
I feel like a kid in a candy store
Love it❤️‍🔥
Ah, looks like we're gonna see that  Doctor Who sex tape after all. Splendid.
Fool me once, shame on you .  Fool me twice....
Season 8 looking good!
FOR FUCK SAKE KEEP D AND that other D away from the SHOW PLEASE
"Dreams didn't make us [ Kings ] 👑 ~ Dragons did 🐲"
They better’ve taken notes lol
Woooooooooooooo I'm so fucking excited
Oh Snap!! Can't wait!!
A black guy with bleached hair... because  diversity and inclusion..
book accurate iron throne? never thought i'd live to see the day
It would be better to call the series Fire and Blood and start with the Conquest but I'll take it.
Looks really pretty, but GoT tended to be even when it started pooping the bed
الي متحمس للمسلسل لايك💗
Why the US stock market only can rise! Because enterprise executives can get huge dividends through the stock market! The government's rescue of the stock market is actually delivering bribes to these executives!
Does it really matter when everyone knows how badly Season 8 of GOT was ballsed up by Dumb and Dumber!
GRRM is an executive producer, this looks promising at the very least
Show some respect for the dead. Y'all killed this IP. Just let it rest in pieces.
To those sceptical about this: I hear you, believe me I'm nervous and not getting my hopes up... but at least give it a chance - new writers, new heads of HBO, a completed GRRM story. It has a chance to do better than GoT.
I'm a fan of Matt Smith, but he looks like an alien with bleached eyebrows that don't seem to even exist. They keep repeating the same mistakes: Thor's bleached eyebrows changed in later movies - Ciri's bleached eyebrows changed for season 2 of the witcher. I'm missing a few more but its always so bad!
Should I love or hate it?
Pqp só em 2022 😪
Lol wowww what a coincidence I literally just started and finished GOT last month I was still mourning my Khalissi and now the Lord of Light is coming through!!
This time im going to wait till the season over before i decide to watch it
I  already feel this will suck... Are those black Targaryens?! How is that possible and why?
Are those Valyrian of color?  Twitter outrage mob appeased.
I may have to subscribe to HBO again!
YASSSSSSSSSSS, I'M SO F*CKING HAPPY
I can't help but feel excited, but I'm also just as nervous. Hopefully GoT was a big enough lesson to learn...
I'm ready to be hurt again, HBO. I'm ready.
I am yet to recover from from how  GOT ended .
house velaryon!!!!!! looks like i came from that house lol
https://youtu.be/ZK7IYSrBuVc
wow
I know I shouldn't, but shit here we go again.
I be damned if I’m not hooked already.
Epic! This is gonna be tremendous!
Can't wait to be disappointed again
¡¡¡¡¡¡¡AH!!!!!!!!! I can't wait damit!!!!!!! Oooooooooohhhhh
I've never been so unhyped for a show, GoT seriously ruined my hopes for this show :(
I literally called it I was saying to myself when Game of Thrones finish. I hope they do something else based of Game of Thrones like 10 years later or something but just a different name!!
LOL NOPE!! Who cares what happened 200 years before? It all comes to a meaningless turd in the snow that two dimwits left. PASS
Here's hoping they don't shit the bed in the last season
i predict this will be horrible lmao
Why did it sound like Ramsey was narrating ?
TARGARYENS ARE SUPERIOR NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND
I wish I was more excited about this
Don't mind me.

Wait HBO Max come on
Stick to the source material and this series will be more epic than GOT

Its like an abusive relationship, i get beating every now and then but i still love it
I'm so ready for this 🔥❤️
I feel they will rely on Sex, CGI and great "vistas" instead of story.
Seems better
Hopefully they do a proper job with this one and help us get over the shit D&D gave us from seasons 5 to 8.
Ah shit. Here we go again
YESYESYESYES!!!!!!
Wait
This is going to suck
An is only used when the following word begins with a Vowel. An HBO original series is incorrect. It should be A HBO original series. Or, An original series.
House of The Dragon sounds like a mouthful, I would have sticked to simply House of Dragons. Afterall, it is Game of Throne and not Game of The Throne.
Geronimo!
I wonder if big boy is gonna screw these show runners over as well. Another half finished series 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️
0:36 Was that Orenstein?
We wuz kangs n shiet
Just came to give a thumbs down and a stern "FUCK YOU" to everyone behind this show.  This is a fucking mistake. GoT is revolting.  I can't believe they have the audacity to think they will make this work. How stupid do they think we all are?  Do they really think so little of their audience that they believe everyone just forgot what happened?
Once more, unto the breach.
Where's the purple iris???
MATT SMITH!!!!!!!!!!!
Winter is coming.
Holy fuck, black Targaryen's??? Yeah, this is gonna be sick.
Ramin Djawadi....are you?
sounds like Varys is narrating it
How did they make the throne look even more dumb? Already disappointed in this show...
Yeah, more dragons please!!!
Woke
200 years before, but it looks more modern than GOT. Edit: I'm saying that it should look more rustic, more "ancient", if that makes sense.
Yeaaaaassssss 😍😍😍😍😍 pleaaaase don't ruin it this time!!
🐲🐲🐲🐲THE BEST !! HOUSE OF THE DRAGON
The doctor cosplays as geralt...im in
Looks promising, love the book accurate throne. I hope they make a Dunk & Egg show next, but at the same time there might not be enough Dunk & Egg for them to make a good show
It's official. The 'cock counter' must be reset. 😆https://youtu.be/m37zONpcj9c
As long as this comes with phenomenal Dialogue, Acting and action like Early GOT them this will be great. If TWOW drops next year too then that will be the Cherry on top.😂🤞🏾👌🏾 Finally, a deeper look into House Targaryen...and their Dragons. I'm glad we'll get to see House Hightower one of the most prominent houses in the Reach and realm. Hopefully more of House Tarly too. I'm also looking forward to seeing Cregan Stark as well but most of all I want to see Storms End!! Throughout GOT we never saw it, please tell me you've done it justice. Anyway, for everyone's sake let's hope they stuck the landing with a strong ending.🤞🏾😁
I'll watch this series AFTER it's finished.
Seems like it’ll make all of the mistakes GOT did.
Director: We need to make the Iron Throne closer to how it appears in the books. Props Dep: We can tack on some swords to the steps. Director: Will it make the throne look taller? Props Dep: ..... sure.
As long as D&D are not involved in this project, I’m sure it will be great.
hope will fix your last mistake
Who gives a fuck? We know how it ends.
HBO is batting below average in the prequel department though…
Excuse me sir, you have your doctor in my thrones show
So, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a Targaryen?
Lets hope the producers dont get a call about making star wars movies, so that they cancell this series early and get's a shitty ending. Dont really need that deja vu experience tbh ^^
I see that Viserys's wig is still alive and well after all those years.
Do not screw this up! Fool me once...
For a die hard fan who wants this to be true to source material this is a really bad start….
Now don’t ruin this hbo
They should re-cast Jason Momoa as one of Drogo's ancestors with a different beard style to make up for what they did to him previously. I'm sure fans will love it. 😆
Game Of Thrones : House Of The Dragon✌🏿 My First Love✌🏿
I simply don't care about this AT ALL LOL
كالعادة راح تكون النهاية سيئة مثل نهاية قيم اوف ثراونز بس العمل عملاق وعظيم هذا ما عودتنة علية HBO
Ayy mamma miaaaa!!! 🥵
We all know how this series ends anyway. Fuck it
after watching game of thrones for so many seasons that serie has big shoes to fill and gona be hard to deliver what game of thrones did
That's a real IRON Throne !
Can’t wait to see Littlefinger’s early ancestor, Middlefinger!!😂🤣
Can't wait for this. I refuse to believe they'll manage to fuck up twice
It is kind of sad to have this show to watch h given the season 8 ending, Daenerys is dead, Jon is on the other side of the north. Season 8 really messed the show up. I hope this one is good but idk. I think I will pass on this one. 😭😭
You use the symbols of my people , illegal . We are Agathirs ...
The original ending wasn’t that bad, y’all are still just salty that you didn’t pay attention to foreshadowing and created your own ending inside your head that never came to be. “If you thought this was going to be a happy ending then you haven’t been paying attention”
You ruined all things Game of Thrones with your retarded last season.
looks like i'm getting hbo max in 2022
what is this dr who meets witcher bs
I just can't look at his face and not imagine him with a bow tie on!!
After the shitshow of GoT's last season I won't even be giving this a chance
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 🇦🇷
Why is the Doctor in Westeros?
TeamBalerion
The new Witcher season looks really good
Black Velaryons🤡🤡🤡
And I just finished game of thrones, I literally started watching it 2 weeks ago, dude this timing couldn’t be better haha.
Tywin Lannister would have made a much more epic show,  “Tywin Lannister - the rise of the lion”
“Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did ”  I'm so excited 🔥🔥
Dragon’s Did.🐉🔥🔥🔥🔥
O nome dessa série em Português, seria como? Casa dos Dragões?!
Don't worry everyone. The book for this one is already finished.
The blackwashed taergaryan looks ridiculous 😂😂😂😂
Yay another thing I won’t be able to watch because HBO max hasn’t come to Canada yet.
Yesssssss can’t wait I so psych
Really excited to find out how they ruin the last season of this show
It's hard to be excited for the prequel of a show that ended so horribly, this new show has big shoes to fill.
Lmao "200 years before the fall of the Throne" seems like a subtle jab at the fate of the show after season 4.
😲😲😲
Will not watch after the dumpster fire of a last season.
GoT you better not fuck us this time
LOL black Valyrians. I knew it was gonna happen. "Everything woke turns to shit"
Bleach my hair and call me Daenerys 🐉 I’m so excited for this !!!
Remember when that Man of Steel 2nd trailer dropped years ago? Well that always causes me to pause and think when I see a trailer that makes me excited for a show/film. Maybe this will be something.
I would be a lot more excited if the ending of the original show wasn't bad
it’s the armor Rhaegar Targaryen wore when he fought Robert on the trident 🤯🤯
Just when I thought I was out... They pulled me back in 😤
The Ruler’s Back
Fool me twice...
Do not fuck this up.
WE WUZ VALYRIANS AND SHEEEIIITTT!!!
Finally 😎
Can’t be any worse than season 8 of GOT 😂
200 years doesn’t seem like that much of a significant amount of time for so much to have hung on the dragon longs. I mean considering the much much longer history of Westeros (Which is a town in Scotland I’m pretty sure it is).
I'm here to tell you . . . this teaser trailer grabs ahold if you in its first 20 seconds!!!  I'm looking forward to the official HBO trailer this Winter and would appreciate the street date for TWOW at that time as well.  House Velaryon looks incredibly impressive as they make their arrival to the tournament feast in the Red Keep throne room!! I'm sure this was what GRRM had in mind when he originated the change after signing the big new HBO contract which obligated him financially to assume greater executive authority of his sSoI&F prequels lol.  I wouldn't have done this diversity move myself (COUGH*Ser Cristin Cole*COUGH) but if GRRM likes it then I love it . . . please George just send in WINDS already to Bantum Books!  Enough is enough!!!!
When the series wraps and it has a confirmed good ending, then will I trust HBO again.  They screwed us with Deadwood due to a pissy Billionaire's family, and now because none of the executives could be bothered to check in on Dan & Dave during the massive final season of their largest show, ever.  PS The Deadwood movie, a re-hash of the last season practically ending in the same way, was a giant middle finger to fans.  We do not forget, but will forgive if you SHOW us that you changed.  See you when it is done, well.  EDIT - Oh, and this is another unfinished series that George will never finish.  He cannot/will not write an ending to save his life.  So be prepared for the excuses to be leveled at him for not telling them what the story should be, again.
Cannot wait!!
Years of GOT & now this, written in the woke era. Yeah, no I'm not sitting through another one of those Drag it out for years with TMI and then jam the last season into a joke. leaving so much unanswered. Now going backward? China can keep HBO's BS
Hope they don't fuck it up like they did with the ending of GoT.
I really hope this isn't as bad as Season 7 and 8. I hope we see some other houses, apart from the house Targrayan. Maybe if this does well we might get a history of the other houses of Westeros.
Sora is in smash
Anyone notice the Triple Headed Dragon?
I hope they have better writers this time. The final season of GoT was a total insult to the viewers.
meh
please dont fall into the fan service trap.
😨😨😨😱😱😱😱
meh...
Please be better
Finally! A sequel to Enter the Dragon!
That throne ooooooooooh! So much better
And you lost me with Matt Smith. Although I guess he looks inbred enough for the roll. No thanks, after the dumpster fire that was G.O.T.
You had me at Dragon, baby! Now don’t screw it up!
IM READY IM READY
This is just the GoT producers clamouring to reclaim glory, after Chernobyl wiped the floor with them.  Don’t care, just going to be another work of medieval fiction choke full of modern political narratives and themes.
You better not destroy this series HBO
Ay yo it's the doctor
Can’t wAit!!!!
Wheel of Time, The Witcher, The House of the Dragon, LOTR all have a common theme now. For purists you will never have a accurate look of characters you read from the source material again. Unless of course its a project where the source material isn't based on white people, then they will cast the actors with a accurate look. Even shows on real historical figure aren't safe from this. Only show i saw which hasn't been infected by modern standards of casting is Netflix's Last Kingdom.
Does John snow know about this or he still knows nothing ?
Seeing Matt Smith in this gives me high hopes for some reason. I love that man as the Dr. Can't wait to see him in this and hope for a good overall show!
MATT SMITH!!   GTFOH.......  That is some genius casting... wow...
just by looking at that poor excuse of the Iron Throne, one can tell this will be as much non-canonical heresy as the original show. this TV universe was already a shit adaptation since the first GoT episode. only good thing they can do is let it die. a proper adaptation of Asoiaf can only be animated. the Clone Wars show would never have been possible as a live-action, nor can any big Asoiaf story bigger than the Tales of Dunk and Egg do justice. RR Martin should have ended all relationships and deals with HBO after they allowed Dumb and Dumber to abrutly end GoT, and in the worst way possible. the only thing I want to see of this TV universe is a sequel and proper ending of the Telltale game.
Why the US stock market only can rise! Can't fall? Who is manipulating the stock market! Who's in charge? Who is the bookmaker of gambling?
Great let's get it !! Don't puck up the ending like the last one please and thank you
O NOVO GAME OF THRONES.
Doctor Who is that?
Well the story has already been finished for this series so I don't think they can mess it up this time. But I'm still cautiously optimistic.
Cant wait for season 8 of this new show.
My poop runs red with Targaryen blood and i walk funny too
Black Targaryans with dreadlocks are hilarious🤣 What were they even thinking.
ахуеть!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So long as the writers remember what made the show famous:  knife tricks, army respawns, fast travel points, Starbucks, tinted cameras, and a complete lack of regard for dialogue and consequences, this show should be terrific.  *infamous
Yesssssssss
This really makes me miss Daenerys Targaryen 🤍  The trailer looks promising 🤞
I take it this is an adaptation of the Dance of Dragons. AKA the Targaryen Civil War.
Ah, I see they changed the ethnic makeup of house Velaryon for "inclusivity" reasons.  Game of Thrones more like Game of San Francisco.  Apparently old Valeryia was a "meltingpot" now.  Loads of different looking people living there with no lore context or reason within the world for being there. Just modern politics screaming in your face, keeping you from being immersed in the setting. Maybe they'll hold a rally or a song and dance number while twerking too. Why not just include characters that would fit the lore while still being black/asian. Like people from the summer isles or something. The black washing of characters is so annoying.
Aaaaaaaaah ya la quiero ver pro favor no decepcione.
Hypeee
even if the show is good, what's the point, cause within HBO's canon, the house is still destroyed, and the Queen betrayed and murdered in cold blood. WHAT. IS. THE. POINT.
Start with the dragon killing everybody so the rest is unpredictable
This looks fire 🐲🔥
Hoping 🤞🏻dragonglass blades makes em come back to life
Could be good for a few seasons, but rest assured they'll run it past its prime...
Redo the last season and I’ll give this a chance.
I think I’m finally ready to have my heart broken again
how bout the FAT MAN FINISH THE DAMN BOOKS ALREADY I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO KING STANNIS IN THE NORTH AND I WANT TO SEE EURON'S APOCALYPSE AAAAGGGH
Meh 🤷🏾‍♂️. This looks very white washed and a bit blah.. Game of Thrones ended horribly, I don't think anyone is truly excited for a prequel to a story that ended horribly..just saying.
Idk man.. Can't be hyped for anything Got anymore, since the massive disappointment after realizing which turn the show took... I stick to the books. American filmmaking is rock bottom, void of creativity and ideas.
Did they finished filming? This seems a bit early. I guess they had enough footage to make a teaser and get people hyped.
After the GOT ending I'll pass.
Matt Smith!!!!! Ahhh!!! So excited
I hope they do better with this then they did with sopranos
More inbred than Joffrey, but just as entitled, and made worse by their dragons. I am looking forward to not watching this flaming dog turd.
@rochyrd eh mentira ya diponible en you tube
@rochyrd eh mentira ya diponible en you tube
nope, you had your chance to be written in history as best tv series ever made...
Will we see the mad king finally?!
Absolutely stunning to watch,, can't wait.
Honestly, I'd rather see them remake the last season of GOT than this
Omg
I really have to ask myself if I really want to watch this after the absolute dumpster fire that you guys made out of the original GOT. The last season and the ending just plane flat sucked. I can even watch it anymore and I usually rewatch show like GOT. Sorry but still haven't forgiven you.
0:39 Only one person of color? Why you can’t make them all? White people…
If GoT went from great in S1 to shitty in S8 and this here is long before S1 — it has to be the greatest thing ever!
Meh
After season 8 clusterfuck I just cant put myself to watch this.
Bad name
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I'm going to wait to see if HBO gives this series a decent ending before investing my time and money into watching it. The way they ended Game of Thrones was so bad I dropped HBO out of disgust.
gay..
I see matt Damon, I click.
I am so hyped!!!!!!!!!!
Based on a True Story.
So they all gonna be blonds and f*cking each other
Too late. You screwed up season 8. Let it die in infamy.
So excited to see what Matt Smith does next in this role 😁😁😁 (Even though we know everyone ends up dead)
LETS GOOO
Sooo does this follow any of the books? It's a prequel so I don't know what the source material is? Or is it just all brand new stuff pulled out of GRRM's ass?
Sequels/Prequels are rarely if every nearly as good as the first. I am thinking total flop.
Everyone: "THE THRONE IS BOOK ACCURATE!" Also everyone: *ignoring the black Valyrians*
Can’t wait for my expectations to be subverted.
This video is the equivalent of a “you up” text from your ex… and we are all answering.
WAIT! Did they make ALL the Velaryons black!? Why just why?
doctor who
After the lame ass ending of G0T,  I have very little desire for this.
I already know how it ends because I read the story it's based on. Spoiler alert: its garbage
I hope this team can write well for Matt. Him and Tenant were both amazing, but Smith had some terrible writers and still managed to be one of the best Doctors IMO.
Heck yea, matt smith is in the house
Not watching a single episode until its final episode is finished just to be sure it’s not utter shit before going in
“Raise up, motherfuc*ers. The show is about to began”
Game Of thrones up until season 5 had the source materials , season 6 and forward they came up with it hence that awful horrible last season. so they really cant fuck this since the books for this adaptation is completed.
Looks like shit
This does put a smile on my face!
It's going to be wild when the butler rings the dinner bell and every single Targaryen turns into a raving lunatic for no reason
Too many white hair.... In GOT we got White Walkers, no in HOD we have lots of white hair Targaryens
I can't believe they got Dan and Dave to come back!!!
Wow that looks really bad
I didn't really enjoyed the last few episodes of GoT but damn it! I really love this universe!
I still hate them because they did with the las season of Game Of thrones
Music is good show looks stupid just like Game of Thrones after Season 4.
I recommend watching the history and lore from A Dance of Dragons to paint the picture of what’s about to happen. If you don’t mind a spoiler or two😉✨ still super excited to see it unfold.
I wish I was excited for this. GoT just killed everything so much for me. We'll see.
Do you know what will get people excited? Showing what looks like the most boring parts of the old show. How do you not have any moments of flash or excitement? This looks like they're cosplaying their own show.  And leaving out anything that made the first series interesting.
Let's be honest, everyone is here for Matt Smith
Cool
Whooooooowwwwwww lets fire the thrones,  dragons
Please do not fuck this up
Cringe
Dr.Who?
It's amazing how much the GOT disaster has soured the franchise for me. Normally something like this would have me all worked up, but I just feel a repulsion now when I see anything that reminds me of the show. It's sad.
wow finally
The quality is all in the dialogue
I just started reading ASOIF this year (halfway through ADWD) despite the shite ending for the show and I'm interested. This world is just too interesting to me to pass on.
Nope.
Not going to waste time on this one after what they did with GOT Season 8.
My god is that an actual throne I see? No more shitty kirkland version 50 sword embarrassment of a throne anymore.
Completely Re-Do the last 2 seasons of "A song of fire and Ice" and perhaps I will consider watching this. You lost my trust...sorry.
meh...
They can't mess this up right? Like the story is literally written for them, they cant change things.
They got Dr.Who in this bitch alright I’m in
After what you did with Season 8, NOBODY IS INTERESTED IN this crap.....you have ruined your best show ever.... so yea Fuck Season 8 ... Nothing can save it anymore .. no matter how good the prequel is.
Some say this is going to be awesome, some say is going to be shit, i say it's going to be average at best
This whole trailer give me goosebumps
I really hope that they'll give a good explanation as to why Corlys Velaryon is black. If they give a good reason then sure, still don't know why they thought that they needed to change his race.
Сегодня биткоин пробил глобальную нисходящую трендовую линию и вырос практически до 52 000$, как будет развиваться ситуация в дальнейшем, будем рассматривать в следующих обзорах
Dream don't make us king dragon does
Who are the writers
Say what you want, but I’m so excited to return to this world of swords, dragons and tits. I’ve missed this.
Hope they dont fucked up liked the other one for  final season
massive Turd incoming!!!
We all know how it ends..... disastrous season 8, knowing all these legends come to an end like that effectively remove any excitement from this teaser, like, what are all these for?  all of the glories from Aegon and Rhaegar, for one of the only 2 survivors of house of dragon turned mad for no reason and be killed by the other survivor of the house? for the right to the iron throne and Targaryen bloodline being thrown away like nothing at the end? The last Targaryen did basically nothing in the final war against white walkers, he also didn't rule other than killing the other ruling Targaryen he loved with insufficient justification, he left to blackwatch which basically have nothingto watch(all of the threats in North have been removed, white walkers are no more, wildlings are allies now), also blackwatch can't have child, meaning house of Dragon effectively ends there, what a pathetic ending to the house of dragons.
Waiting for him to just pop out and be like "ELLO! I'm the Doctor.. I mean Targaryan.  Basically..... run."
This looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
MATT SMITH! GERONIMO!!!
Fire and Blood
The symbols, the throne, the armor... This series already looks much more like ASOIAF.  And yeah, I know it's because of the budget.  _No matter what, I am _*_SO #$@%ING HYPED!!!!_*
“AN HBO ORIGINAL SERIES” that’s a good start
we hoping HBO don't screw this series like game of thrones final season HBO : i will fuc*ing do it again
I really hope Ramin is doing the music. The music from the trailer certainly sounds like his, so I hope I'm right. Can't imagine anyone else doing the music.
Doesn't really make any sense having fully black and fully white Valyrians. They're all supposed to be closely related. I was already annoyed at the hair color of the Lannisters in GOT but this takes it to a different level.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCFliLJV5_wFT02OHeuTyvhg 😍😍😍😍😍
I follow the dragon
Lmao was that a bleach blonde black guy?
The voice in the teaser reminded of Ramsay Bolton! Anybody else feeling the same?
Good that expectations aren't that high thanks to trash season 8
Gotta do something with all those costumes and sets
I see Matt Smith, I like.
🔥👏👏
Reshoot season 8. Thanks
I remain skeptical given how the butchered the last 2 sessions of GoT regardless if D&D are not involved.  Incompetence that high can't be forgotten.
Season 8 dude....
Take your fucking time with this one for the love of all that is holy.
By the looks of the actors it seem like a low budget show
Ok, I think I've watched this too many times... anyone else?  lol
me right now: 🤡🤡🤡
We wuz Targaryens an shiet
oh gawd i hope it wont be a great show that I invest in for a fews years and them decide piss it down the toilet when it gets time to end it.
matt smith makes it watchable regardless if it's good or bad.
You guys know you can upload in 4k right?
Is that Matt Smith?
Yeaahhhhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Were there black Targaryens in the books:history or is this done just for PC?
honestly this teaser was quite underwhelming
Incoming! yeah its a repeat..it always has been.
HARD PASS.
I have goosebumps
Can’t wait to see the so called “MAD KING 👑 “
Thankfully they have a giant ass book and 5 other giant ass books full of random details to pull off. Maybe the books will be done before the show catches up.
https://youtu.be/wo9yOlRgJ2c
How can they call it "House of Dragons" but not even have a single dragon in the trailer
Spoiler: Bran will be King
Before trailer: Redo GOT season 8 else am not watching  After seeing trailer: OMG😱😱 I can't wait for 2022!!!!!!
The damage has been dealt, and the ashes are still falling from poor writing and several character assassinations. What should’ve been easily one of greatest shows of all time, became one the most forgettable with probably the worst final seasons in television history.
Hope they don't screw it up and make it political like every other American TV show
I probably gonna pass. I dont like prequels (when you already know how it will end) and am still pissed at season 8.
Goosebumps 💥., When the Throne comes ❣
I don't care for the Targaryens but that looked cool.
Omg omg omg omg omg omg omg omg yes yes YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*En espérant que ce préquel soit bien construit de bout en BOUT !*
Westeros finally got some color 🙌 🧝🏿‍♂️🧝🏿‍♀️
That's NOT a teaser, that's a peace of boilerplate shlt
Not even a glimpse of a dragon? I miss drogon… I hope they don’t hold the budget on the CGI and we get to see more dragons fighting then political shenanigans.
Hope they will not screw up the last season please 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Weak trailer
God I hope is not the directors of the 3 last season of GOT
That's NOT a teaser
Dumb and dumber didn't write this so it will be better 🤞
Hard to get excited about this after they destroyed Game of Thrones. It's like trying to find a nice section of the pool just after someone goes diarrhea in it
"I swear I've changed baby please come back I love you"
gods, kings, fire, and the doctor!
Damn we are almost there. 👍😁
looks actually insane
They should thank god they got Matt Smith for this
I can already tell itll suck
So u decided to invest on filming a 2 books series which is missing the second book? Are you nuts!? Didn't you learn anything from chronicle of ice and fire??? Are you going to destroy this story with poor writing like u did with s7 and s8 (plus half of s6)?
Cool can they redo the main season from start of season 6 onwards please
I am here to see Matt Smith saying to a dragon, "Oh, what a beauty!"
Where is my king jon snow :/
Alguien sabe si esta basada en algún libro? Por que si no será una serie del montón más
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Ummm....they need to change to title immediately!!  "House Of Inbreeding" sounds way better and then HBO will def get the backing of The Windsors!!
Phillip!!
At least  D&D are not involved.
George's bank balance be like: 💰💰🤑💲💸💸🤑💰💲🤑💸🪙🪙🪙
I expect nothing short of perfection. HBO has a lot of making up to do...
Does anybody know what house/who the people with dark skin are in this trailer? I haven’t read the book so I’m unsure
whoa, the costumes look much better than they did for the second half of GoT.
Woke trash
So this is where the eleventh Doctor ended up.
would rather have a show about a new house or the lands Arya is seeking than more crappy cgi dragons
"New psychos every week!"
And what? you're going to cut the ending short again just like GOT? Disappointing Last Season of GOT and you're going to build hype again for us to be fooled the 2nd time?
Make Game of the Thrones great again!
its gonna be so bad
ready to be pulled in the got world again
Gee no advances in technology for 200 years?
You cant do worse than the finale season of GOT
Omfg. OMFG
honest question. will you fuck it up like last GOT?
from that throne shot(0:49), I think this series is not canon to the game of thrones TV series, or I hope that it isn't, maybe this could lead to a Dunk and egg series, and eventually a proper Song of ice and fire reboot. One can only hope.
Meh. Over it
Why does everyone in the trailer look so ugly lol I thought the Valyrians were supposed to be a beautiful race?
Lets hope that.... Justice will be delivered this time around     ?
This is how they get you:  It starts off awesome.  It gets even better.  The showrunners get famous.  The showrunners want to capitalize on their fame and secure big deals while their stock is so high.  The showrunners start phoning it in.  The writing takes a nosedive and the show ends up as a big turd that trips over the finish line.
The Throne looks completely different
I BEEN WAITIN FOR DIS ONE! TURN IT UP
WE WUZ KANGZ N SHEIT!!!
I got goose bumps watching this. Is everyone ready?
The dragon did it for me. If done right this could will be Epic.
Toss a coin to... oh wait... lol wrong white hair 🤣  Hopefuly this redeems the ASOIAF. S8 of GoT tarnished it to the ground.
Hopefully it was stick the landing during its last season....
There’s a lot of good will to earn back if I may say so myself.
Oooh I'm not ready for this 🔥
I MISS GAME OF THRONES MAN , can’t believe they killed my girl Daenerys
Please be a great show like the first series and please do not be a super WOKE garbage like everything else coming out these days.
What's the over/under on the number of complaining viewers?
Fire & Blood Vol. 1. HERE WE GO!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My favorite part of GoT was the overarching threat of the white walkers… i hope there is an equally compelling villain for this series!!
Not watching it  Sorry last season was that bad can’t trust them
Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin...
I was here for this let the dance begin   Long live the rogue prince damon targaryen
finally the real one not the fake ones fire and blood be coming out with
:-O
YESSSSSSSS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
OMG YESS YESS
Every trailer uses the same music.
Because George wouldn’t of made that the number one description of the characters
I bet its a woke mess, they've already "black washed" an entire house ,x
Don't try to get in my DMs actin' brand new. You know what you did!
They better not ruin this..
meh
I cannot wait for this, it looks amazing 🐉
I think we know what happened, the Targaryen trio & dragons conquered most of Westros and formed the Iron throne.
GOT prequel vs. LOTR prequel HBO Max vs. Amazon Prime I'm here for it
im waiting 007 and venon 2 i hope comes to max
After the bitter taste of season 8 still lurking in my mouth, I'm hopeful for this. I've heard but not sure how true it is that D&D weren't involved in this? If that's true then I am very hopeful.
I wonder if they’re going to use “Dracary” like Dany.
…no thank you.
trash
WHAAT I FINISH THE SHOW WEEKS AGO THEY DO A NEW ONE NO WAAAY
Excited
This actually looks good. Can' t wait.
Never has the term 'cautiously optimistic' been so appropriate. It looks good. But then so was most of GoT. Most. We'll see
Can't wait for a fantastic show that fucks up the ending ! !
I’ll watch it after the series is completed and it is confirmed by the fans that it wasn’t a bad ending …. Not repeating the GOT mistake
Am I the only one who doesn’t give a shit about melodramatic one-dimensional Targaryens? They’re as tedious as LoTR elves. Would’ve loved something more human, like a Stark prequel.
Nani
Black targaryens???? 👏LETS 👏GOOOOOOOO!!!
No thanks.  I don’t want to trigger my season 8 PTSD
Don't let Dan and Dan ANYWHERE near it.
*Just waiting for Jeremy Jahns to do a trailer review of this.*
Season 8 was so bad that I have exactly zero hype for this.
Повесточка-то что я люблю!  Пара па пам пам.
This was the biggest "Meh" of my life
Somebody let me know if it stays good _until the end_ of the series and, if so, then I will check it out.  No way I am investing that much time again in a GOT-universe television show only to have the rug pulled out in the final season(s).
As long as Dumb & Dumber aren't involved everything should be just fine;)
🥱
Am I alone in saying that most prequels just suck. Really not looking forward to this at all, sorry.
Hope they dont ruin last two seasons of that one
Aight yall reeling me back in with this, and I hated season 8.
Aye yo HBO who wrote this? asking for a friend.
Well at least they can't ruin the ending, we already know it.😧
Why are the Velaryons Black? Very odd choice. They're one of the only other families descended from old Valyria, that share the exact same physical characteristics as the Targaryens. Hence why they're so close.    Why not just make up new characters if you need to fill race quotas? Why whitewash lore established characters?   This is racist as f*** HBO.
Shite dialogues, you'll see. I'm not impressed at all.
This can't come out sooner 😩
No one cares.
I see.. Doctor traveled through the time and space to Westeros! -"Bowties are cool"
Matt smith looks kinda goofy with the hair but I’m excited to see him :)
Dragons 🐉 real or no?
This looks garbage
Matt Smith??!!!
Can we please start getting these things with actual dates, not a just whole year? You know, the point of a trailer?
You know what? Fuck it, if there's nothing better to do in 2022 then I'm watching this
Gonna be interesting to see of people watch this...you know... because of the EnDiNg
Who am I kidding, I'm going to watch it.
Was that a black targaryen......
4 million views in 12 hours wow
You know GoT sucked in the end but you're still going to watch this because you have to consume
should it not be "a hbo series" rather than "an hbo series" ?
Our biggest complaint from the Battle of Winterfell: WE CAN'T SEE ANYTHING IT'S TOO FUCKING DARK  This show: doubles down
GOT ending still giving me PTSD, it will take alot of motivation to start this series
I mean after D&D ruined GOT, got to say I'm not excited, I'm scared.
No thanks.
i still cant believe GoT is over
The house of dragons with no dragons HBO birch want make money from this
I don't have high expectations considering the last season of GoT, but I'm willing to give this one a watch and I hope I will be surprised
I told you not to trust me -Little Finger
Matt Smith!!!
Fire and Blood are coming.
If only Season 8 hadn't soured my taste for all things Game of Thrones related.
Just redo seasons 5-8 but good
Q' pasada. Por favor no cagen el final.😪🙏🏻
Not sure how I feel about this. We know how Martin's incredible books were butchered by the previous show.....
Ахахвхахахах Таргариены в угольков превратились)))
They cant fuck it up twice
You can't watch this if you're not vaccinated.
Watch this in .25x speed fucking trippy!!!  Plus you get to see characters longer....
why are the Targaryens black?  Are you kidding me. what is the point with this pandering shit just be true to george rr martins story its so distracting to make them black when we all know they weren't in the stories before.  Its like putting black people in medieval Europe like a lot of showrunners like to do.
YEES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
WE WUZ VALIRYANS N SHAIEEET
Is that little fingers dagger in 0:41?🤔
meh genuinely not excited at all, i still feel the burn from the show getting worse season after season and then ending with the worst season ever that i actually regret watching. they should have waiting another few years
Great
lmao, they really gunna try
I have mixed feelings about this...because of how stupid they ended game of thrones. It was so stupid. One day dragon queens entire army is captured the next day she wins the war. Everything with the incest stories. And for 7 seasons they built up winter us coming but destroyed the ice king with less effort than the battle for the capital. Then don't get me started with the ending of Jon Snow. I think we all could agree that it was stupid to send him to the wall.   Sooooooo I'm unsure about getting into another show which has a terrible ending.
20 bucks says Winds of winter book still wont be released by the time this show is over, calling it now
I'm a targaryen now targaryens are cool
Damn I am proud as a Doctor Who fan to see Matt Smith make it this far! I hope the show is good.
Please don't f*ck up the ending this time! 🐲🐲
That throne tho 😍
IM SO HAPPY TO SEE THE DOCTOR IN THIS OH MY GOD
Goosebumps!!!!❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥
1-10 how important y’all think it’ll be to watch GOT before this?
Please don't fuck this up. Please don't fuck this up. Please don't fuck this up.
This show is going to have to work very very hard to get any respect from me.
esto esta de putas madres jaajajaa
I hope we also get to watch this flame out to ruins.
Looks like a woke piece of garbage
Matt Smith from Doctor Who as a Targaryen after Maisie Williams (Arya) appeared in some episodes of Doctor Who. I just love that connection.
I don't know. I want to be excited, but the last season of Game of Thrones really burned me. I feel like HBO won't make the same mistakes David and Dan did....hopefully those two hacks having nothing to do with this show.
Me moje y eso que no está tan bueno el trailer!!
😍
Wowowowowowowow
I mean, since GRRM has no plans to finish the series and also has no plans to expand his forever unfinished series, HBO can simply write this as how they see fit and give the old fatass his royalty check
pls give us a rounded and well ended show. thank you
I want white walkers tho 😂👏  Medieval undead war seems like FUN to me.  And we got such a lackluster finish to the night king last time anyway 😑
Black blond people?)))))  America, you're kidding us)
Matt Smith being Matt Smith, LOOK AT MY BOY OH THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING
Omggggggggggg thank god
They did house velaryon dirty they did them dirty there are no black valerians at all are what no no they did my favorite house dirty it was bad enough that they weren't even in the Pucking show of game of thrones but now they did this race change them no no no no they did them dirty
Matt fucking Smith!!!!
Rhaenyra Targaryen= Daenerys Targaryen, Viserys I Targaryen= Robert Baratheon,  Alicent Hightower= Cersei Lannister,  Mysaria= Varys,  Harrold Westerling= Barristan Selmy,  Laenor Velaryon= Renly Baratheon,  Otto Hightower= Tywin Lannister,  Daemon Targaryen= Viserys Targaryen,  Criston Cole= Jaime Lannister
As uncomfortable as the throne of swords probably feels when sitting down, yall gotta admit it looks cool here 0:51
i want to be excited, i really do. but we all remember what happen the first time around.
Looking forward to watching this show from Japan 🇯🇵
No one cares
Dios no puedo esperar, la historia de los Targaryen es mi favorita.
Let the cashing in begin. They literally didn't even finish the original series
who cares
Not sure if Matt Smith is buff enough to play Aegon, he'll do well though
Mon dieu
Who even cares about this stupid shit show anymore.. They completely destroyed it with GOT.. this is just a cash grab because 99 % of subscription to HBO cancelled after GOT.
Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did.
Excited to see mad king 🤴
How does the quote go (fool me once)?
Dumb and Dumber fucked this franchise forever. Can´t say I´m riveting in anticipation.
so do you have to be a fan of the Targaryans to enjoy this show?
Can't wait for season 8!
People will still complain
Can't wait for HBO to ruin the ending to this one as well!👍🏼👍🏼
If D&D have ANYTHING to do with this show, I'll pass.
They messed up the last season so bad I don't even care anymore lol
The 11th Doctor Matt Smith ❤❤❤
Nope. After the disaster that was the end of the GoT series, I don't think I'm going to watch this.
А блондинка то с монголоидным разрезом глаз! Ну или валлийским разрезом кому удобнее/ понятнее - как у Джеймса Мэя из Топ Гир !
We wuz kangs.
Nothing like the first one 🔥
Who would suspect, "Bran the Broken"   M.Night Shomalongalinglong pops up on screen saying through a huge smile "WHAT A TWIST"!  Never Forget. Winter Came. All over the fans faces and then peformed a Cleveland Steamer, or in my area its called a "Texas Pete Surprise"
They ruined GoT, so why should I care about this?
i honestly hope they just make it like a 5 part mini series. the GOT franchise died out with that last season because of the writers/screenwriters, so if they've brought back that same writing team for this prequel series i really dont expect much. here's to hoping that dont drag it out more than the story demands.
Wie dumm seid ihr eigentlich?
Too many white people!!
Blonde blaxx.  Im not saying dragons are more realistic tho. Nope, not goin there.
Anybody else surprised that the Targaryens aren't black?  Oh wait nvm this is HBO, not Netflix.
Meu Deus tô morta 😭
0:49 Missing the dragon skulls meant to be in the throne room, this is gonna be shit.
I can’t even pretend to be excited for this knowing that it all ends the way it does…
u know its gonna be shit when its HBO Max
Cancer returns
Do not fcuk this up. I repeat DO NOT fcuk this up.
Can't wait for this series to start, but I  really want a House of The Direwolf series 🐺
The throne looks way better then the one in GoT.
I just want D&D away from this as much as possible
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.
dreams didnt make us kings,,, girl what! it was literally daenys the dreamer who saved the targaryens from dying out in the great doom???
EU ESPERO QUE VCS N MATEM UM PERSONAGEM FORTE INJUSTAMENTE!
Confidence level is 0
Looks good
Is that a GoT and Doctor Who crossover ?
Hope Season 8 directors not even no even provide an opion on this.
Good luck. Don't fuck it up again.
They will screw it up as well so why even get excited or watch it at all. When they could have redone season 8 and made two more seasons or even more and people would have been happy.
Dumb and dumber aren't here this time, are they?
The tournament scenes look much better than the ones in Game of Thrones.
what month in 2022?
I’m gonna be that person and point out that the Targaryen sigil at the end is wrong...
Hey, if you make it past season 1, how 'bout you stick the landing this time?
We all know how it ends (🤢🤮), so what is the point?
❗❗يا رب أتوسل إليك باسمك الأعظم أن ترزق صاحب اليد التي ستدعمني بالاشتراك  👍🔔فرحة يسجد لها باكيا ورزقا لا ينتهي،🙏🌺♥️💚
Sheesh
Yes! Ramin Djawadi is BACK as composer. At least that’s one good thing that will be consistent throughout the show.
Hmmm as much as I like Matt Smith I wished they would have gone with non mainstream unknown actors for this series the way they did in GOT!
ayo hol up
Ojala este al niver de las primeras temporadas xdd
You have to win us back, HBO. It won't be easy.
So just like to throw out there the final season of GOT was not THAT bad. It wasn’t horrible. It has its flaws, but it was still enjoyable in certain ways and parts. But I see why so many people are desperate for this. I’m not gonna put my 2 cents in on how it looks until the full trailer, but I will say this. it’s either gonna be really good, or really dogshit no inbetween
Let’s not watch this show to show HBO they screwed up Game of Thrones.
Looks like << déjà vu >> !
PLEASE DONT RUIN THIS SERIES LIKE YOU DID GoT
WTF IS THIS SHIT
I wanna see who is playing Aegon II and Aemond
Where’s Sozin when you need him? Lol
The new Doctor Who looks great!
Who cares when the main story was so brutally botched.
I choose to hope.....
Oh, why the heck not?
Will we see Melisandre?
Gaffer! Where is the bloody gaffer!? fuck it... cam at speed...
Don't fuck this one up, yeah?
This looks dope
Why the vallerians have black color skin? They had white skin, white hair and blu or viola eyes in the books. 😒
https://youtu.be/NeSaIh7OItc
Benioff and Weiss are gone so I'll give it a chance. Don't fuck this one up.
OOF
Dec 2022
Where there is Matt Smith, there is hope
Wheel of Time, The Witcher, Dune and The House of the Dragon. What a time to be alive.
I’m ready to be hurt again
I am Hecker Stormborn, of House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria – I am the Dragon’s Son. And I swear to you, that those who would harm you will die screaming.
Amazing!!
I wonder if the final season of this show will be trash
I am not ready to see Balerion!
The original show went to shit when you didn't have a book to follow, how tf is a story with no book to follow NOT gonna be a shit show?   Here ill predict it now, bad forced romance and shallow character development because we are gonna go to the well of killing off people for a cheap shock way to often.
ew. more incest? more poor plot lines? more lame dialogue on tits and cock?
So we're finally getting a more book accurate throne?
I’ll tune in but they better not pull the same shit the did in GOT, worst ending EVER.
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn! This looks amazing!
Last season of GoT ruined any desire for more content from this universe for me personally tbh, pretty over it. But am sure some will enjoy it, so all the best to this series!
So is this like a remake or something? It’s gonna be weird not seeing the same actors for the same characters though
For everyone screaming it'll be bad... D&D are nowhere near attached to this project, not even as producers. When you hit rock bottom, you can only go up! George is directly involved, the true music god Ramin Djawadi is back, the book story is already finished so there won't be any more writers ad libbing the finale. Serious money has been pumped into it, looking at the production design. There's some great actors signed up for it. This will be HBO's flagship show when it hits us in 2022. At least that's what I keep telling myself.
Ахуеть неужели, ебааааааать у меня приступы, о боги спасибо что услышали 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I hope D&D have nothing to do with this. I don't want another amazing 6 season and 2 shitty ones because they think they're getting Star Wars money again.
George Martin is cowriting the entire series, and the man he chose as the main writer is obsessed with the books and will be following it very closely. The show is in good hands.
Incests are back 🎉🎉
0:17 Balerion the Black Dread 0:21 Otto Hightower. The hand of the king 0:24 Blackfyre. The sword of the king.
House of the Trash.
AYO WE WUZ TARGARYANZ N SHEEEIIIT
Really liking the velaryons design
Just keep D&D far far away from this and maybe it'll be good
is it going to be filmed in the dark like the last season of game of thrones, i really i really hope so! NOT !!!!
Honestly? Fuck them.  Unless they pull some timey-wimey bullshit with a very small alteration to either Bran or the Night King or SOME fuckin' thing which changes the last season, who gives a damn?
Let's go 🔥
🟦🟦🟦🥶🥶🥶🟦🟦🟦
What's the point of a prequel when I know the ending?? Now matter what happens ... it's gonna remind me the ending.
0:52  MORTAL KOMBAT!!!
What's the point, knowing all this lead to the nothingness GoT's season 8 was?
When Dr. Who is tired of fixing everybody's shit.
Matt Smith is going to want to wear a Crown this time!!
Lets hope this isn’t as garbage as season 6-8
The show must go on ... eagerly waiting for that but there is a request ... Please don't make blunder in the last season like GOT 😅😅😅
as  bad as they screwed up on GOT the last couple of seasons, do they really expect people to watch this? HAHHAHAHAHHAHA
Why is the house of dragons looks so diverse. This show is a clown show already
This looks cool, but I don't trust HBO with anything from A Song of Ice and Fire anymore. Not going to watch this.
Hell yeah, I'm into some blackwashing, Let's go!
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice..
meh
0:17 is that Balerion?
Like I'm sure many have already said, the last season of the show broke all faith I have with HBO and this universe.   For me personally it's extra insulting that it's about this house after the send off Daenerys got
Lol are they serious.
This shit looks so good🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️
Please tell me the GoT directors are out.
OMG! I’m ready!
This is an apology for the last season of GOT.
Did anyone else stop breathing when they realized this was real?
I never thought I'd hear the GoT soundtrack again. Almost as good as my first nut :')
HOUSE OF THE WALKING VIKINGS THRONE CARDS BREAKING PRISON
If its made by Dumb and Dumber, no point in watching them ruin another great story
There is no conclusion???🤣🤣
Black people with blonde hair? Have you guys been smoking meth?
Yawn... should have spent money on a better ending for GoT.  No thanks HBO - saw you end one series horribly - not falling for it again.
I really hope House of the Dragon will be better than Game of Thrones. The Iron Throne is much more legendary than he was previously. Fire will reign! 🔥🐉👑🐺🦁⚔️🛡️
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 can you tell im excited
FINALLY
Looks fucking epic
Does everyone who liked this video forget how terribly game of thrones ended???  Or are they just here for more jangling keys???
Lol, black Targaryan, woke clown shit, hard pass
Looks more basic than GOT, shot bland & unoriginal. Unimpressed.
yoooo its doctor who
Even tho,the throne looks more like the book description. I canna prefer the one in got
God damn it, still trying to forget the last season. Do not fuck it please.
Sorry, won't watch. The North remembers...
bad choice of actors but im not hatin lol
I’m staying apprehensive, but am very excited for this new show. One thing Game of Thrones had was extremely rich dialogue that they were able to pull pretty much word for word from the books. We all saw how much the writing tanked after season 5 when they passed the source material. House of the dragon will not have that benefit, but I am pleased to hear the director is not only a close friend of G. R. R. Martin but also a super fan of the series for the past 20 years. That gives me high hope that they are going to do this fantasy world justice.
please be good
I hope we hear Ramin Djawadi again.
After the mess that was the last few seasons of GoT, I would rather name my firstborn Lancel than watch this crap.
Will a handicapped boy who asks a long time friend to sacrifice himself to save his life be designated king by a dwarf at the end this time?
pog
Can't wait for all the GoT Youtubers to disect 1 Minute footage for 30 minute videos.         Just kidding I love it.
Im ready for this ! hell yeah!
I hope it fails miserably cuz of what they did…
The last episode of game of throne was a piece of shit hope this is not....
dont fuck this up HBO
The Tardis should fly in.
Skyrim for Nords
Yesss! The real rulers of Westeros. ❤❤❤❤
Don't mess this up
Why are the targaryians black lol am I missing something here
GRRM sold the franchise to rats in small hats. It's been unwatchable trash ever since. These parasitic rats sure have a knack for underming, cheapening, and destroying what better men create.
This is so exciting!!!! I’ve been patiently waiting for this to drop!!!!
That armor holy shit
Remake season 8!
Who wrote this ?!? If its the old screenwriters D&D then I'm gonna pass on it.
Love the tourney armour with dragon wings on the helmet, very faithful to the books! 0:37
Can't wait
Need to breathe slowly into a paper bag....
Guess I can't even be exited about GoT. Sad that watching this I could only think of how awful the last few seasons were. Got no faith they wont do it again. No trust in HBO
Looking forward to it for sure. I'm so glad we didn't see a "insert dragon CG here" text anywhere in that.
Can't be worse than that one season we don't talk about, right?
Really really hope this starts and ends well unlike GOT
Where do those black people come from? I didn't really read books so I don't know.
Daenarys THE DREAMER made you kings and Queen's. So yeah dreams did it.
looking forward to everyone bleaching their hair after watching this show.
OOOOOOOOOOMGG
I Can’t forget the last season all those years wasted. Nope Not again with this B.s. I’ll rather re watch the Wire
No thanks, let me spoil it. 1st few seasons amazing and last season it will suck so much you will regret watching it.
Hopefully this show is better than the storytelling in the last season of GOT, but I have my expectations high as George RR Martin is an executive producer and co-creator on this.
four-legged dragons  ..
WE
I look forward to either an absolute dumpster fire or the rebirth of Beloved Series
I want to care, I really do .. but it's too soon. I need another decade to get over my GOT rage.
Wow
Don't mess this one up!
finally  something else to ruin
I heard this show is about tacos
hm. Is Game of Thrones worth watching? After hearing how bad the ending was, I'm certainly hesitant investing time on something that ends poorly.
omg this is so heckin WOKE
0:36 banner, armor and shild look amaising
Я спокоен за ХБО. *Так как у руля этого проекта, как и в последние два сезона "ИП" стоит **-сапожник-** Сапочник, то за выпуск дерьма можно быть уверенным!*
mfs better remake season 7 and 8  dumbasses
HBO y’all still can’t redeem that screw up. I don’t care if it felt like a slap in the face to the cast and crew. It was a slap in the face for fans that made you all.
Not interested after franchise ruined by D&D.
Who's actually excited for this? #RemakeGOTSeason8
It just doesn’t hit the same like a new trailer for game of thrones would 🥺
looks good
Is it Dumb and Dumber writing this one or other guys?
FIRE WILL REIGN
Remember that one show they made that ended up being the worst show of all time with the worst ending of all time…. This is a prequel… so… guess where it ends up…. Still sucks
I actually have high hopes for this show. Remember everyone, they will have BOOK material to go off of unlike the last 3 seasons of GOT. If they can adapt the book as well as GOT did in the earlier seasons, the magic should remain.
okay yeah im sold
is this based on a book by George RR Martin?
lets not fuck it up this time ok ?
People remember the last season of GoT right?
this is soo played out.  no one cares anymore.  none of these extremely white people are innately interesting.   this series would be more interesting if we get to see all this from the dragon's perspective and how their plotting led to their demise.   i am also tired of seeing 200 years in the past and they were still using the same equipment in the last GoT series.
I see a mixed race girl?? Or princess 👑 the black guy is definitely a Targaryen Relation.
No more Dumb and Dumber thank God
Looks lit, no pun intended.
Please tell me Dumb & Dumber will not be involved...
0:39   "House of Affirmative Action"   Coming to HBO Max in 2022.
You are telling me that all these will eventually ended with Arya Stark using Sting to kill the supposedly invincible Night King? Nah ... not again.   Also, I have already unsubscribed from HBO, nothing you can do to bring me back. Your dragons can go play with themselves.
What is the point we all know how it is gonna end 🙄
Looks okay ig. Still kinda stupid though knowing what will happen to they’re decedents. All of this build for nothing.
The ex that I told myself I would never take back has just texted me “remember all the good times?”. She’s looking pretty good ngl. What should I do?
WAIT WAIT WAIT....MATT SMITH?!??!
This has great potential. 1. D&D are NOT involved. 2. GRRM is an executive producer. 3. Sapochnik is an executive producer. 4. Djawadi is the composer. 5. The source material is complete. 6. They have HBO's funding.
Love how everyone's jumping back into this like a bad relationship 😂
Where are the dragons?
D&D is never to be seen. This could be good.
I excite.
just hoping it wont be like season 8 of got
Well...after watching the trailer, I'm still mad about how Game of Thrones ended....I will be waiting for reviews from the people before I watch this....sigh
Looks like shit
We will see.
Gods.  Kings.  DOCTORS!  HELLO, DOCTOR!!!!  :)
Welcome to the Game of Thrones, Doctor.
слишком много негров
I hope they know, they only have one roll left. If it is bad, GoT will be a dead franchise. And honestly, I am not convinced. I checked the first trailer of the original series, and you won't guess what it was about... characters! The very thing that made this series unique. And what the new trailer is about again? Visuals and dragons... not another season 8 pls.
I hope they learned from their mistakes in Game of Thrones and keep the quality without relying on cheap fanservice.
can there be any English medieval story without Dragons and castles??
I tried to forget the disaster that is season 7&8, now you just have to remind me? No one cares about GoT anymore, why dont you understand HBO? Just wait for the rating you idiots.
Just remake last season of thrones
Please let this be like seasons 1 and 2 please for the love of God
Reminds me of game of thrones!
The Epic Saga Continues
Hope the end won't be shit.
Geliyor mk🙏🙏🙏
Everything else is fine but I just can't seem to take GOT related content seriously after season 8. It doesn't matter to me anymore (and yes, I'm here only to comment this :p)
HOUSE TARGARYEN FOR THE WIN! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
Donde estás los dragones! No vi ninguno volar poniente!
Please be good. This is literally HBO's only chance to save the franchise. If this fails, we probably wont see anything GOT related for another 20-30 years.
looks like a shiiiiiity shit
I'm rubbing my hands like Birdman right now!
No se suponía que los targaryan eran esclavistas?
This is going be something truly special
Is this set during the dance of dragons? Or after? The quote “dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did.” Is giving me post dance vibes. Where house Targaryen no longer has dragons. But I’m also getting hints that it’s during the dance? It’d make for some great inter-family conflict, within the “house of the dragon” idk
We wuz targaryens n shiet
Probably gonna see maester pycelle because he’s at least 250 years old
I'm not following for your shit again, HBO! I never forgot the ending to Game of Thrones!!!
Eh, I just don't care. Good luck though!
No D.B Weiss Or David Benioff is a good sign.
I see a legendary show coming up and am pretty sure the producers will not let us down
Knowing in what failure it all ended with GoT ? I think this one might be cancelled in one seasons. Unless everything is perfect and they nail it so well, if the writing will be idiotic again, all what people will remember is the travesty that was GoT season 8. That is why prequel regarding the white walkers was cancelled. Might work, but I doubt people will be kind if it's not top notch after Got.
Im looking forward to see the incredible dragons
Lets fucking GOOOO!! 🐉 🔥
I'm ready to be disappointed again 🤞🏼🤣
Pls don't do this.
yeah, i think im gonna wait until the final season airs.
CHILLS
The ending of GOT was so bad that Doctor Who had to go back in time to fix it
YALL 👏 BETTER 👏 NOT 👏 FUCK 👏 THIS 👏 UP 👏
Too many whites. Where are the Asians? Black? LGBT? how many transgender people are in this series? Game of Thrones was a disappointment, especially the finale!
FINISH THE BOOKS, GEORGE!
Was that Rob Stark speaking at the end of this? It sounded exactly like Richard Madden!
We need to know the story that lead to such a horrible ending.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
HBO: Game of thrones Prequel!  Me: Eh...  HBO: Benioff and Weiss aren't involved at all!  Me: 🔥🐉⚔️🛡️ Lets GOOOOOO
'An HBO Original Series' or 'A HBO Original Series'?
Ohhh coisa lindaaaa
What is the 11th doctor doing there?
look at all these big dummies who think its gonna be good
Thats little Dany. You guyz are happy?
matt smith <333 omggg!!
YAAAAS!!
Was that Balerion??? Can’t wait to see him!!  Edit: Probably wasn’t, most likely his skull
OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE EPIC !
OMG!!! 🤩😍
WE
Oooooohhhweeee.  Let's go.  HBO. Just don't mess it up like Disney did the latest star wars movies. (Not the mandalorian) Stick strictly to the storyline.  Looks good via trailer!🙏🏾🙏🏾
Ooooh, I am so excited!!  The backstory of the Dragons in this series is awesome and I can't wait to see this new masterpiece!
Bro Dany was wronged
Awesome 😍 Love It ♥️ It's Been So Long That I Been Waiting For This🥰🤩
This one better be as good as it looks
Do u remember last season, be aware!
hi, remember how we ruined your favourite show? now we made another to milk this, we know you'll watch it, right? RIGHT???
House of dragons teaser, has no dragons.
I couldn't be more interested 🔥
I'm not seconding this, until I watch the ending first, & I am satisfied.   Wake me in 8 years time.
If only they didn't ruin GOT I would still care about this one
The only reason I may watch this is for the dragons.
"I don't want it." - John Snow, seriously this looks like garbage.
%; yb
I got the feeling they need to make ALL possible sequels and prequels for Game of Thrones.
black Targaryen ?????????????????????; what ?
I don't trust you anymore, HBO. After the last three season of GoT the trust chain has been broken.
Yall better not fuck this up like you fucked up season 8 of game of thrones, the north remembers
They finally understood that Targariens needed lighter eyebrows. Better late than never.
Still salty about Season 8
Oh look, the doctor travelled to the GoT universe!
please don't screw up this show like the 8th season of GOT
CANT WAIT!!!
Damn you, Matt Smith.   Now I have to watch it.
Please don't mess this up HBO
no plan, no choose, not enought...
Das way of das dragon is gentle and kind because it is powerful.
black velaryons lmfaooooo
So no sister fucking?? 🤔
Let’s hope it works out better than the last time
Dont fuck this up HBO!
If they break my heart again, I'm going FULL HOUND eating a room full of chickens on everyone
HBO: 'yo man, we need some jamaican targaryens for the twitter crowd'
I pray there's some actually competent writing with this one
Please just don't let those incompetent retards who screwed up the show anywhere near production this time.
They should also make the previous shit non cannon
AYO WE WUZ VELARYONZ N SHIT
My watch has ended
Nice. just don't fuck up the final season ;-)
Alright HBO Max, I need more than 1:17 of footage. This looks too good for a small slice!
Wow the iron throne actually looks the iron throne bravo finally getting it right
First mockery of the plot of "Game of Thrones", now dug up the book "Fire and Blood" and want to continue this violence? Hell, no.
As long as there are no starbucks cups and water bottles in the shots - then sign me up!
really excited , i hope they dont ruin this one in the end
Ay mi madreeeee 😍
And the forced diversity continues! I can already tell this show is going to be shit.
https://youtu.be/tDvZZVIPeqc Nobody , a minute to know!
Honestly I didn't like the trailer, I was afraid that they are gonna force the "Hollywood" style into "fire and blood" story and my fears seems accurate.
WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?
Nah. Won't be watching this. You really lost your audience when you left Game of Thrones so poorly finished.
That was definitely vhaegars growl
This will be the most epic true story every shown on TV
Wow
Cringe
Nothing new nor interesting. Hopefully I'm wrong for in my mind there is nothing better than Arya.
someone get the doctor a snickers!
House Velaryon is of Valyrian descent, and its members often have Valyrian features, such as silver hair, purple eyes, and pale skin
Me vuelvo locoooooooo!!!
Meah…..I’m not interested in the sibling f#ckers  that are the Targaryen’s. I’d rather have seen a spin-off of Robert Baratheon killing, drinking, and whoring himself to an early grave.
It took only a minute and twenty five seconds to completely reignite a fan base.
DRAGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONS
I like Matt Smith but I still maintain that he's been miscast here. No offense but Daemon is supposed to be like better looking lol.
FUCKING GOOSEBUMPS
Cool, can you guys remake season 8
This Dr Who crossover looks weird...
PORRAAAAAAA 🤘🏻🙅🏻‍♂️
fuckkkkkkkkk lets goooooooo
YESSSSSSSSS
This got me so hype!! 🔥
Matt smith is rocking that hair
man like the teaser
WHERE THE F ARE THE DRAGONS???????
If HBO can green-light a Game of Thrones series, you can ask that girl out.
lmao is that a black targaryen? 🤣😅🤣😅
Dracarys!!!
Doctor Who time travelling again
The original GOT was good. But taking it to a next step will not make it any better.
Türkiye gündeminde görüp izleyen kardeşlerim size de günaydın
there are many interesting things to note throughout this teaser which i would highly recommend looking out for. this took me a while to do but i hope it helps out anyone wanting further info on the trailer :D  -CHARACTERS 0:10 Rhaenyra Targaryen and Daemon Targaryen (possibly on the shores of Dragonstone?) 0:20 Identified Otto Hightower, identified by the badge of Hand of the King and the chain around his neck 0:23 King Viserys Targaryen "the young" sitting on the iron throne holding an un named sword (i don't think its valyrian) 0:29 Young Rhaenyra 0:40 Mysaria,  its a brief shot but shows how she will be a key character in the series, ally and concubine of Daemon 0:41 A young Queen Alicent being shadowed by members of the kingsguard (not sure why she's holding a kinfe) HOWEVER it does look raaaaather a lot like the dagger wielded by the catspaw and then arya, interested to see where this goes    -DRAGON HEAD at 0:19 ,  perhaps this is some kind of altar for the Targaryens owing to the candles in front of it, or it could just be an actual dragon?  -DRAGON KNIGHT i would assume that this is Daemon Targaryen at his brother Viserys' tourney at maidenpool. he is fighting an un named knight, who, assuming this is the tourney at Maidenpool is Ser Criston Cole. The dragon knight can be identified as Daemon as he is the only man of fighting age in the Targaryen family, at the time this was set (assuming this is not a flash back), he is also dressed in fine plate that would only be reserved for royals and is possibly wielding Dark Sister, the sword bestowed on him by Jaeherys I.   -HOUSE VELARYON it seems like this is slightly more faithful to the old lore of the valyrians, i think i saw the predecessors of the house of Velaryon at 0:39 with the braided hair- identified by the sea horse as their crest, however this could be another house entirely. This is further reinforced by the fact that the character Emma D'arcy plays is Rhaenyra Targaryen, who in the book "fire and blood, married Laenor Velaryon of Driftmark, perhaps   -FEAST IN THE RED KEEP looking closely, the iron throne is placed on a dais, however is empty as it is a feast, behind the dais are the banners of house Targaryen and Velaryon. People seated in Rows are looking towards a character in the foreground, presumably Rhaenyra owing to the way her hair has been done (this is tenuous but its the best i could come up with)  -JOUST  you can see the banners of various great houses however the most notable part of this scene is the clash between the two knights. the Crests of house Cole and another house- i don't think its house targaryen even though i can make out the red and black, possibly house Kargyll, (cole being nine black pellets  on a red field and Kargyll being A golden goose on bendy sinister black and red) once again reinforcing the idea that the tourney will happen at maidenpool.    TWO MEN FIGHTING i assume one of the men is Daemon based on his hair, not sure who the other person is though  IRON THRONE okay, its big! once again looks like Rhaenyra, possibly walking towards Jaeherys  also, bit of a stretch hello to Alt shift X if you read this :D
Türkiye gündeminde olduğuna göre bi selam verelim dedik. Türkler beğensin de sayımızı göelim
VAMOS TILIN ESO TILIN !!!!!!!
This will either be the best series ever or the worst show.
А дом а дракона.
It's nice that we get to see the other Valyrian houses as well, judging from the people wearing house Velaryon insignias.
I dont fucking care, remake season 8
Is that the best they could come up with, I know it's a teaser but still
Re-do season 8 already please.
I'm more hyped about the intro than the show itself lol
At least now the throne looks more like depicted in the books
I hope this Teaser made D&D (Dumb and Dumber) realize that it's way more better than the entire Season 7 and 8. Shame on you D&D for what you did to GoT. Only if Ramsey could cut you like he did to Theon for your crimes against the sacred GRRM storyline.
if that's really a black-skinned targaryen at 39th seconds...i'm out!
Game of Thrones was kind of like eating a bucket of your favorite ice cream only to find a dead rat at the bottom. I feel HBO needs to do something to earn back trust before they can expect fans to get invested in a fantasy show again.
Where I can found the music ?
I'll be happier when they announce the season 7 and 8 redo.  That'll be marvelous.
Let's go! 🔥
I know I should be happy, thank you for making this. But I DON'T TRUST YOU HBO!
Watchable on Netflix, does someone know ?
Never wasting my life with anything related to this series again. Burn it all!
And no Benioff and Weiss - that gives hope.
Don't F this up
Hell yeah!
AH SHIT, LOOKS LIKE I'M BUYING AN HBO MAX SUBSCRIPTION AGAIN
Desperately trying to hold onto what D&D ruined in 3 episodes
I'm looking forward to see how you are going to butcher this show
Please dont make us suffer
Really hoping dumb and dumber won't get anywhere near this one...
Sounds like Ramsey's voice.
At this point idc how bad the last season was, im so excited 🔥🔥 if it’s even half as good as got it’s going to be fire 🔥
Don't mess it up HBO. Please no diversity bullshi...
What about the white walkers?? Any sign of them ??
I really want this to be good.
We all know how it ends, so what’s even the point of this🤨
I’m so excited!!!! Ahhhh!!!
LEGENDARY 🔥🐲
GARBAGE.   I LOVE HOW IT'S 200 YEARS PRIOR YET THEY HAVE THE SAME CLOTHES WEAPONS AND THE OTHER LITERALLY SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN THE SOCIETY I MEAN I KNOW IT'S A STUPID LITTLE SHOW BUT STILL DRAGONS DIDN'T MAKE YOU KINGS GEORGE R MARTIN'S DREAMS OF FLOPPY WIENERS DID
This looks like a wierd episode of Dr.Who
Where's the Dragons ☹️
Why this movie is satanic https://youtu.be/8B58nxWsFi8
YES YES YES!
yeah to avoid being disappointed by GOT's again i am going to walk in with zero expectation for this to be decent. If its good then great i have another good fantasy show to watch again if not then i can laugh saying the GOT curse continues and at least enjoy Matt Smith's performance seeing as i am a fan of since his dr.who days.
...meh...
Holy shit! And this already feels different from the main show! And the throne looks different now?
que paguen un año de suscripción dicen, esta bien, no hay problema
This could potentially be even better than GOT if they take their time and do it right
I don't know if I can watch this, my trust issues are honestly through the roof since the GoT finale, like everytime I hear the name GoT I get ptsd
The potential is legendary. The story has a rich and robust background and to top of its in the A Song of Ice and Fire universe. The writing is already at the wall. They better not screw this up.
Hope the show is good.   Still really turned off by GoT S7&8
Skeptical about the writing quality of this because of the continuously lowering quality of the later GoT seasons.   However The dance of the dragons is my most favorite bit from asoiaf lore and I'm so glad they are adapting it first.    "King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land"
Wow, multiethnic Targaryens!
*Oh shit, here we THRONE  again*  😅
Seeing the iron throne,makes me both sad and happy
Omg yes
Wow. Getting my favorite Doctor involved was pretty much the only thing that would've gotten me interested and they did it xD
Yaklaşıyor Yaklaşmakta Olan
Woke of the dragon??????
Cara, pfv que isso seja bom do começo ao fim, msm com o final de GoT ainda confio na HBO, bom que os dois patetas não vão dirigir essa série graças a Deus
Their accuracy is so bad that they blackwashed the Targaryens.
First scene with a guy holding a torch looks like he's going to fetch a dragon🙈
Baelor!
Doctor WHO wtf
He looks like a white walker
Funny how in 200 years the technology in Westeros didn't seem to improve or evolve.  Just look at humanity in the last 50.
Read the book fire and blood and already disappointed with this
Littlefinger's Dagger at 0:41
I swear to god if you guys pull another series ending like GoT had... I will personally lead the lynch mob. >.>
#TeamBlacksneverGreen
https://youtu.be/m8g9wpTPZwU
Really wish they would have started from the beginning of the book. Maybe they'll do flashback seasons.
There It comes
So is this from the time when they had like loads of dragons or when the dragons started to die off
THEM: "Baby, I've changed. I swear. It's gonna be different this time." US: "...you promise?"
House of Dragons: From the Book of Game of Thrones
House of the Woke Tokens.
I will not spend another decade watching GOT like series ! I have a live you know !
Fucking chilllllls
What if Bran appears periodically? That'd be fun.
Fool me once, shame on you Fool me twice....
🥳👨🏽‍💻🤌🏽🏛🔥🐲
I can't wait to NOT watch this.
Here we go again we have to fucking wait till 2022
I'm interested but man I'm a little nervous after the shit show that was the last couple seasons of Game of Thrones.
PLS do not name your kid after a character until you see the ending!  Thank me later...
The black albino killed me hahahahaha
I just soiled my self can’t wait
Yes ... i want more - more more more.
Kurama is death, i dont care this :((
Just don't let D&D write it. Please.
Hard pass.
woooow
Valar morghoulis
Take my Money🤑🤑🤑
It's gonna be bad.
OMG TIME TO BLEACH MY ONE STRAND OF HAIR👩‍🦳👩‍🦳
I’m curious, is this supposed to be about the dance of the dragons or just a point in time during the reign of the targareyians?
Imagine the enthusiasm if you hadn't f***ed up season 8 so badly.
Checked IMDB to see who's creating it Didn't see the two Davids Breathed a sigh of relief
lose the Game of Thrones in the title!
The used gram considerably program because porter quickly suppose without a squeamish plough. axiomatic, last shrine
So HBO has decided in their infinite wisdom to do another Game of Thrones show based on a book that isn’t finished *what can possibly go wrong* 😬
So glad we get to escape back into this universe! Can't wait!
In a small way I kind of want it to fail in the hope they finally listen to fans and bring back the original thrones either for a full remake of season 8. / More episodes added into season 8. / or a season 9 to help explain all the questions & character arcs left unanswered by the end of the show.
MATT SMITH!!!!
When the doctor regenerates to a Witcher
Three centuries later, Valyria’s last scion will be the last one to ever rest her hands on that throne - the story of House Targaryen is the most beautiful tragedy to have been written
Not even a glimpse of an actual dragon I’m disgusted again.
I wanted two things of this series: - To have Henry Cavill casted as Mushroom - To have the Velaryons affro... A man can't be greedy )=
Please, please, think very well, the final season of this series. I really  dont wanna be upset with The final chapter like with GOT.
Fuck I can't believe 😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. eagerly waiting for 2020⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
❤️❤️❤️
Yotan ties from way down the rd. The lst of a knd soldz
❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
I will take a look just because of curiosity but how screwed was the Season 8 of GoT can not and won't be forgotten.
❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Why are the wigs always bad for the Targaryens ugh
looks like a big huge steaming pile of  disappointment  but maybe..... just maybe, it won't be complete shit
Was that Disney's Merida in the Teaser? 🤣🤣🤣
0:33  "Hello.....Im the DOCTOR"
Is this why HBO rushed to finish GOT S07 & S08? Now, what if this entire series is going to be like S07 & S08?
Oof, don't know how I feel about this casting
Was that a black Targaryen?
Wow nice dr who vibes
There will always be the mass which hypes up everything without questioning 😅. After what happened to GoT I take my consequences. 🤙🏻 But you do you...
If they DIDN'T fuck up the ending of the actual show, my god this gives me trauma's from that show
digging the iron throne’s more book-accurate look
I'm still in recovery from the last season of GoT...
Is George doing something for this show or he let them to do everything. I hope not
You betrayed your fans, you disrespected your viewers. One single episode on the whole war against the Winter Kings??? You shall not make your money! You shall fail. Valar Doehaeris.
This show is meaningless. We know Jon Snow doesn't kill the night king, the Stark line ends with Sansa and the Targaryen's are all dead. We know the ending and its fucked.
Ramin Djawadi's back!! *happy silly dance*
I'll pass. Sorry.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This teaser would have broken the internet if Season 8 wasn't so shit and nosedived the entire GOT franchise into the icy water.
Hopefully Dan and Dave will be back on this!
Holy fuckkkkkkkk
ansiosa demais pela estreia
Guess he keeps the dragon in the Tardis? Enough room
por isso que te pago HBO Max!! rs
OMFG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐲 LETS GOOOOOOO YES CANT WAIT FOR THE FULL ONE
Just let us know when will air the last season so we can avoid it 🤷🏻‍♂️
Ah yes, the people known for being pale and blond just as I remember them, black
Gotta watch GoT again.
Please don't make it woke. Enough shows have crashed and burned because of woke fascism.
Hype is real!
black Targaryens.... ridiculous  😂😂
I'll pass cause i know how it ends 200y later. Doesn't matter how good story is untill we get season 8 reboot.
is this before game of thrones or after
*Without George RR Martin’s writing this might as well be a trailer for fast & furious 12*
CAN'T WAIT!
Amazing. But why is it "AN HBO ORIGINAL SERIES" and not "A"? What's the semantics here?
this... looks... awesome.
please dont fuck up the last few seasons like the previous show, if it needs to be delayed i rather that than to abridge the story down to a dumb kid story
Only question who the h*ell playing cregan
Siiiiii ❤️
Let's hope they keep woke agenda to the minimum!
Hope they dont make an awful final again
Fuck it, I’m in
mannnn idk…its hard for me to be hyped after the sh*tty season 8😩…what a 🗑
'Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did' 🔥🔥🔥
We see the actual iron throne from the books holy shit
😍😍😍😍
YESSS!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Delighted to see something I like and am interested in trending - especially at #1. ''Valar morghulis''.  DRACARES!!
Q: What's that show with the knights, dragons, and white-haired people again? Game of Thrones or the Witcher?  A: Yes.
GAME OF THRONES IS BACK!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Holy Guacamole!!!!!
It looks really good, just one simple question…why the fck is Corlys Velaryon black?
I like how they have the original design for the Iron Throne.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just think as a whole, they really missed the mark on the time period. I guess they want to tell the history, but you already teased Jon Snow and his Targaryen heritage and didn’t follow up on it in GOT…Now you’re going to skip over it again with the same family but an unrelated time period? We shall see.
The throne finnally looks like the iron throne
🙈❤️‍🔥🔥
Amém 🙏🏻
DAEMON Targaryen 🔥🔥🔥👌
For some reason everything in this teaser looks and feels small especially in terms of space. Not sure why. The throne room looks smaller and the jousting area too.
How about you reshoot the final season of GoT firstly?
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm gonna wait until the series finishes before I buy. After they screwed up GOT I dont think I'm gonna waste time or money on it until I see how they handle the last season.
where are so many blacks? and why the princesses are so scary, was there really no one better? no need to make the show tolerant, it will ruin EVERYTHING
I have questin what Dumb and Dumber doing now? Did netflix   dont pay them a lot of money i dont hear about anything spectacular from them
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Who's directing it?
Meh... it has lost all of its allure - at least on the screen.
taRumlüg  Programmierer der Master   K. I.
If anyone has a dragon around two years old and neutered, let me know
These cgi dragons better be bad asses. Give me some real scary looking dragons. And the house of Valyrian is beautiful 😍
*Dreams didn't make us Kings. Dragons did.* Uhm Daemon, how dare u slander my girl Daenys like that. 😭 She did not convince her dad to move from Valyria to Dragonstone only for this monologue to happen. 💀
Why are there black Targaryens?
it will be a legendary series, spoilers... the end will be catastrophic  :)
https://youtu.be/ptMpXoQecM0 😱😱😱😱😱
Please have good writing. Please have good writing. Please have good writing.
будем ждать опять....
Актерский состав, как то не впечатлил, подача трейлера без энтузиазма, похоже на проходной сериал
OMG ITS MATT SMITH
I have been looking forward to this..
OMG 😮
Will not be bothering with this after the horrendous ending to GoT.
WE WAZ VALIRIANS N SHEIT
All of you guys need to get over Game Of Thrones season 8. It's really annoying to see all of these comments everywhere. House of the Dragon it's not produced by D&D, it is already written in a book by GRRM himself and it's looking great. GET. OVER. IT!
Black rasta LoL, cousin of Aeris 4sure
Please don't fuck up the ending.
Wow, The Doctor went in a messy universe
Looking forward to watching this show.... and then I remember how it all ends. =(
I hope the ending won't turn out like GOT... 😅
It makes no difference, no matter what they do in this series we'll always have those last 2 seasons on GoT on the back of our minds.
This gives me hope, this looks promising, please don't be a disappointing mess.
You let season 8 happen, HBO, I don't trust you.
Don't fuck us this time
You can clearly see the difference between this and GoT. The dark and heavy atmosphere, and the almost movie-like cinematography. This is going to be a heavy medieval drama. No playing games anymore from HBO.
Please your OTT platform released in India 🇮🇳❤️
Honestly looking way more forward to the story than dragons/special effects. The more GoT spent on dragons, the shittier the writing became.
Looking forward to seeing someone get impaled in one of those throne swords.
Speaking of the fall of the throne... anyone else wondering if they'll completely shit the bed like GOT?
So long as D&D don’t even breathe on this show I will watch.. they are responsible for one of the worst cinematic bastardizations of a generation.
Oh wow didn’t know why i thought this was cancelled
I may watch House of the Dragon when it airs for the first time in 2022. Hopefully it will redeem the Game of Thrones franchise. It's got Matt Smith and I am a Doctor Who fan.
As long as it's better than the last 2 seasons of GoT
"im nothing without my dragon"
Vê se não fazem merda nessa série, igual foi as duas últimas temporadas de game of thrones.
if this one works maybe they can remake final season of GOT, like a Snyder cut... it could be the "Not made by dumb & dumber" cut
... I hope those two producers don't com back, they have ruined GOT
Trivium - In The Court Of The Dragon should be played in every episode
F*** Season 8
Wait Eleven as a Targaryen? You have my curiosity. Ten as a Lannister and you'll have my undivided attention. Thirteen as a Tyrell would be awesomeness overload.
Cool
is this off a book? do they have source materialor is hbo team making up all the dialgaue?
WE WUZ KANGZ N SHIET BRO I SWEAR GOD
Is that Matt Smith?
So when is this out? Next week?
Remember guys. This will never fill the void that was placed in your hearts after the butcher of GoT. This gonna suck. And you all know it.
Not a fan of Matt Smith (cause Dr Who is terrible) but hopefully this will change my mind
Fire will reign.
After the ending of got, and georgey prioritizing everything humanly possible, except for the book series, I'll be passing on this one.
🗑
Can't wait!
yoooo accurate iron throne lessgoooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was ok with ONE black Valirian but looks like is full of them lol
The pain is still too near.
The Rogue Prince ❤🖤❤🖤
Oh baby, that throne
MARVELLOUS 💕 💕 💕 💕 💕
People after seeing this  Wow that's the way you kill a story 200 years later
One has to wonder how they’ll screw this up.
The Iron Throne appears to be more book-accurate, but if this is a prequel to the show, then how are they gonna reconcile that?
The best part is watching this will make the hate for season 8 only stronger
Todo brazuca que quiser comenta aqui 😬 Brasil em peso 👌
Hopefully they do 9 seasons!
GOT S8  expansion?
I'm not sure if I am ready to trust you guys again.
mini series or the real deal?
A teaser? It's more like a warning.
A HBO original series*
Caralhoooou essa serie vai ser braba d mas hype
Oh my god I'm so excited to see more about it!!!🔥🩸
we wuz targarians and shieeeet
It looks like a completely different show
We have been waiting so long
PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME MAKING THESE. DONT RUSH IT PLEASE. I CAN WAIT FOR YEARS as long as its good.
Ouuouw Game of Thrones is back bitc!! :)
Looks like a prequel was the only option left after the writers killed slaughtered menaced the whole story
More Sopranos, less Thrones. That ship sailed. Still love you though, HBO
Please let it be January 1st 2022!! I’ve had Game Of Throne withdrawals, Gods be good I’ve missed Westeros!
Hopefully they don't butcher this one like they did with season 7 and 8
This shit is gonna be trash
the iron throne is the best thing
Team Vikings or team Game of thrones?
I will never get over my frustration regarding that most terrible, terrible final season. Can't help but be very skeptical about this. I would love to be proven wrong, really I would. For now I wait... with anticipation.
Dragon who
This... doesn't loon very good.
Hey man, you ain't wasting my time EVER again.
matt smith is so ugly, at least the velaryons look amazing
WHY?!
hope they won't fuck everything up again......
We wuz targaryens n sheeet
Theres a Black person!!!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌
Looking forward to this, although I have to admit I am disappointed Dave & Dan aren't involved. They did a spectacular job with Game of Thrones, especially in the later seasons when they had the freedom to write their own scripts. Instead of being forced to adhere to the poorly-written novels.
Yay!!!  And I hope it isn't the only one!  We need more Westeros!
Is Cregan Stark not in this season?
This looks 🔥🔥🔥
#Gematria
the chair looks uglier. Yess
Yuppie I'm hooked can't wait 😍
Tá maravilhoso, só faltava mesmo dar férias para a peruca do Viserys, pq aparentemente todos os homens Targaryen possuem o mesmo penteado.
I didn't think this show would go straight for the member-berries, but then 'hey look here's the dagger that kicked off the entire plot.'
Dreams didn't make us king, the Dragons did! Wow!! Can't wait to see this show.
What the f*ck did you do to house velaryon?!   Show is already garbage.
We need money, let's do some game of thrones stuff again...
Rumor has it that David Benioff and D B weiss will make a guest appearance to write and direct a couple episodes. Cant wait for that!
😍😍😎😎🤩
Only watching it for Matt smith 🙌🙌🙌
Best
Damn it's good to see the throne room again
Bro they’re about to ruin the Targaryens like they ruined seasons 5-8
Ну, теперь хоть есть смысл не сдохнуть до 2022.
Sounds like RAMSEY BOLTON'S voice over..
I don't get it, why make this.... SPOILER:      when every one of the main characters die in the end?
Im just here for the dragons
Please don't ruin it like GOT!
Goku Inu is the strongest crypto of them all. He always repays its debts. Get it now
Hard to be excited about anything HBO greenlights after the last Game of Thrones train wreck.
Why your words are so heavy ? Tmhare bol itne bhari Q hai?
Valyrians are not black
IS THAT MATT SMITH?
A man just shat his pants....
Happy to see George RR Martin back at the helm as an executive producer on this - so I'm in...
Black Tagaryans...yeah sure...
LMAO it was only 200 years ago and they speak of all the things like old forgotten legends?
That growl before the literal hell being loose🔥
Just please please please don't pad it with unnecessary nudity/sex scenes. It actually consumed a lot of time on the OG show which could have been repurposed for other stuff.  I just have to say, you don't need that to to sell this IP (And didn't need it for the OG show either).
With how they've ended the last series I'm not sure if I want to watch this one.
I want this In my life now!!!
omg
Finally 🔥
Maybe it was the 8 years of GoT but is anyone else sort of done with this?
DRACARYSSSSSSSSSS
"An HBO" ?? Who is writing this lol
how about we invest our entire life basically only to be heavily disappointed how about we do that
Лучше бы пересняли последний сезон Игры Престолов...
North remembers 😪
Yall fix your app on the ps4 yet? The issue everyone is talking about on Twitter everyday about
Ill watch it but fuck how they butchered thrones
There is something wrong with some Targaryens 👀
just came to put dislike, fuck got with that last season
0:50 why they couldnt just copy paste identical throne from books ? is it that hard ?!?!
Imagine this series in theater's.
The only things that can heal my pain from the last two seasons of GoT are the two final books finally coming out (not so hopeful about that one) and this show turning out to be good, which I'm lowkey excited about given D&D are not around this time to mess it all up. Competent writers are all this franchise needs.
WEHE. IHR. VERSAUT. DAS!
Wow this looks amazing. Just hope they don’t butcher it like GoT. Since the source material for this timeline is complete, there’s less chances of that happening. Hyped!
I'm going to ask anyway, and I refuse to look this up: Who is directing this DOPE looking series? (Hopefully no one from the botched first GOT team is in this)
Steven Brust's House of the Dragon pantheon is better. Adron n Aliera e' Kieron Rule! Vlad forever, Danerys... shes ok too.
Let’s go!
Had chills thru this entire teaser!! Can’t wait for the trailer!! This is gonna be epic I can just feel it! And yes, partly bc we’ll get dragons 😜
#1 on trending ! Even after that shitty final season, so many people still care 🙌🏽
200 years before Game of Thrones got butchered...
After the last season of game of thrones......not interested in this sh*t anymore. Next.
I CANT WAIT
But... There's one they fear...
Are the 2 idiots who ruined the previous show still in charge?
Well at least there are already a few prominent people of color in the cast that are royals, and not slaves or servants, that are just as powerful, so that's already a step ahead of the original!
holy fuck
I really really really hope certain people don't watch this show and bring everything down
Excellent.  Looks very good.  I really enjoyed Game of Thrones, looking forward to this.
Not exited fking writer will kill mail charactor again they are morons they want Fucking twist
yeeesss
Well if they fuck this up, at least there won’t be any excuses this time since in this rare instance George has actually fully finished this era.   I already see cracks in the foundation here, but hopefully it’ll be good.
❤
Insert crazy b!tch screams!!!
It's like GAME OF THRONES -- but with 100% less Dan & Dave! It's a win-win!
I hate knowing the fact that this all ends with Bran being King.
pizza is on its way
Well I’m not watching until the whole season is over I hate anticipating
obrigado, hbo
tô tão feliz
House of the Doctor!
yoooo mother fuking DR who
Was that Ramsey Snow Bolton on the voiceover?
Hmmmm 🤔 a series everyone gets drawn into only to slam face first into the payment in the end we shall see.
Why am I hearing Ramsay Bolton's voice 😭
Can't be any worse than season 8.
Looking forward to watching this show, still waiting for the Winds of Winter
will this have a good ending?
Please don't f*ck this up
Tell GRRM to release the winds of fucking winter
Still couldn't able to believe this. Full body on goosebumps. 😭😌😌😌😌🥺🥺🥺 We are waiting for a long time.
0:53 Naahhhh naaaaahhhhhh...nohhhhh nooohhhhhh 🥰
I'm really looking forward to this! Looks nice but I think I'll see the doctor in him...I hope that the changed look and the acting can help me with that...  (I don't can watch HBO so I have to wait a time...it breaks my heart (: )
Waiting for Phil Foden to make an appearance
Пиздец, это же доктор кто
African blondes? Sus.
I wanted to be excited for this, but I just felt nothing watching this teaser.  Season 8 killed my excitement for anything GoT related.
after the very poor final season to game of thrones, i was not looking forward to this series ... BUT ... they cast MATT SMITH in a pivotal role and now I MUST see it!  Damn them for being so smart lol :) yay Matt :D
Token black guy in medieval times.
Time to rematch 8 seasons of got
0:24 I have waited Years for that Sword. That is probably Blackfyre the Ancient Valyrion Sword of the Targaryens.
I think the story already got thrown in a ball pit of fire.
Still hurt over what D&D did. I sincerely hope the show runners and creative team understand the task ahead.
Damn I saw the memes 😭 and I came here this is true now. Long Time idk how long finally atleast an update.
Not buying it
If there is anyone out there who can make a decent argument about the ending of GOT I would love to hear. I still get so angry just thinking about it. Lamo
Ohh so this is was Prince Phillip was doing after he left The Crown
Problem with prequals is that no one really cares because we all know how it ends in the end... however, that being said... a lot of people love the Star Wars "Rogue One" movie.  My thoughts on this series? Disinterested because of how GoT was carelessly handled in its last season. Matt Smith looks great and would be the only reason I'd watch, if I weren't so jaded about GoT... seriously, 1 episode for the white walkers? All that build up...nothing...
If you Look at the lore of GRR Martin for the timeline and history of Westeros i.am very very sure that this both lead actors should represent Prince Daemon Targaryen and Queen Raenyra Targaryen and the new series will show as the Dance of the dragons civil war. Which is an obvious choice for a GoT Prequel because there will be Intriques, power struggels, sex scandals, treason, murder,war and most important a lot of dragons who are fighting each other. Perfect fantasy sope opera setting
Shite  Not relevant  Wank actors should be attacked
Yesssss!!!! Diversity, yesss  CGI, I’m locked in
So "Fire and Blood" was an AMAZING book. Hopefully this show lives up to it
At least Bran isn't in this
afrotargarien ahahahahahhaah
Just when I was missing GOT This shit is dope
so now this cow gets milked until it falls over dead as well...
Don't burn me in the end like that last series.
Nah.
حماس الف ❤
Nice
Will probably just be woke westeros, after what they did to season 8, this has no books to be based around, i have very low expectations......
And now our watch begins...
There's no excitement when you already know everything will end like shit. Announcement of remaking last two horrible seasons would no doubt create much more excitement.
you ruined game of thrones.. sorry
we need facebook back
I don’t know if I even want to watch this because of how badly Game of Thrones ended. I would love to be excited about this and the trailers look incredible (shoutout to the teams who put this together) but just know how poorly it can be executed makes me reluctant. I want a series that I feel excited about watch then re-watching, then watching again with friends and family. And I’m skeptical that this will end the same as game of thrones.
Só não pode cagar que nem o final de Got né...
Ooo my god 😭😭😭😭 i am crying.. can't wait ❤️❤️❤️
My favorite doctor, in a prequel to one of my favorite fantasy series! Sign me up!
"I'm like Gandalf, space Gandalf". Guess he really was like that!
Персонажи интересные, есть что-то общее с оригинальным сериалом Игры престолов !
Everyone saying about horrible ending season of GOT 🤷‍♀️..bruh every ending has many possiblities .. personally i liked that ending (except bran as king) ..and it almost 2 years since the last show y people still comenting 😪lets forget and enjoy the new one 😷
I hope this can heal the trauma I still have not solved from season 8 ;)
😐
Garbage.
Ohhhhh God😍🙆🏻
I don’t care 🤷
0:38 Ahhhhaha
ill never trust hbo again after the last two seasons of GOT
I dont like this relationship we have HBO where you play with my emotions... you just...keep teasing me!! 😭😭😭😭
the most exciting thing about this series is that Weiss and Benioff are not involved, whatsoever.
Matt Smith??!!
jesus, you guys have short memories .......
We wuz targaryens n shiet
HBO Production quality? Check. Ramin Djawadi musical score?  Check. No D&D?  checkaroo....  Fuck it, I'm in.
BALERION CONFIRMED
First couple of seasons will be good & then the final season will be complete shit making us wonder how we invested so much only to get a shitty ending.
Okay I'm sold
Can they start with the final season? This time I'd like to know beforehand if im wasting my time
WOWWWWWWWW CANT WAIT
When you closed the finale with that stupid ending. No matter what's the introduction. It's just a show with an idiotic ending.  There is much more interesting stuff out there, just saying 🖖
I hope there is some clue related to the possibility of Daenerys's resurrection.... i really hope so. Even though she went mad at the end she deserves a proper ending and that a honourable one.
- "the Valyrians are famous for having silver-gold (platinum blonde) hair, very pale skin, and violet-purple eyes" - 0:38 Did you think that it won't be worse than the 8th season? Will.
Ну все, у Дмитрия Юрьевича и Клим Саныча будет работы еще на год-два! 😃
Ohhhhhhhh yesssssss🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We still remember
"Dreams didn't make us Kings Dragons did" So you are telling me that if I take away your dragons, you aren't worthy to be a King.
Te perdonó, pero no me vuelvas a fallar
Los Valaryon son de color?
200 years means it won't be about The Conquerors, and I guess some of you know some of this characters, so can someone tell who was the king at the time? I want to know if this is Dance of the Dragons or something else
WE NEED A PROPER ENDING FIRST !!!
Which character is at 0.40 ?
Y’all better not fuck this up
We wuz Targaryens n sheeeit
Is this ivan rheon narrating?
and where Dragons?
Really enjoyed Game Of Thrones apart from the fact they screwed up the last season  .  Or did they just  run out of good writing  .  Or rush the end so that they could run off and film another project  ?
Prequels: You can't screw up the ending when the ending has already happened.
At least the books for this series are FINISHED so I have hope, FINGIRS CROSSED 🤞
Yo solo espero que no lo arruinen como arruinaron GOT porque la verdad los Targaryen son demasiado fuertes para que vengan unos simples mortales como los Stark y les ganen osea no tiene mucho sentido que un humano sea más que un dragón.
🔥 🔥    🦉
Loved GOT, now I just have to hold out hope that this isn't as rushed as the final episodes were. There was a good story buried in there, just not enough time to space it out and I blame Marvel.
The hype is back. I repeat, THE HYPE IS BACK.
As the the mother of dragons used to say "Dracarys"
Fire and Blood
after that shit season I'm not touching anything GoT related
Velaryon, Targaryen, Tarly , Cole
We meet again gangs. 🔥
Okay everyone, place your bets, what do we think they're gonna change from the book?  My guesses:  * Reduce the number of characters, dragon-riders especially. I reckon they'll lose Aegon II's youngest brother Daeron the Daring and his dragon Tessarion, along with Rhaenyra's Strong sons. Baela and Rhaena (Daemon's two daughters) will be merged together, most likely keeping the name Baela (since they don't like having multiple characters with the same/similar names, it confuses the Normals). We'll probably shed most of the Dragonseeds too, I definitely see Hugh Hammer and Ulf the White being merged into a single character, and I've a feeling that we'll see Addam of Hull merged with Alyn Velaryon (the future Oakenfist), and he'll die in the Second Battle of Tumbleton. We'll probably also see the number of dragons killed in the Storming of the Dragonpit reduced, with some of them being merged with Syrax and whichever dragon they give to Aegon the Younger here.  Though they're not dragon-riders, I also think they'll reduce the number of Aegon's kids, merging Jaehaerys with Maelor, and him being killed by Blood and Cheese. I imagine Dalton Greyjoy and his raiding of the Westerlands will also be written out.  * Streamline the war. Thanks to the Strong kids being taken out, Viserys will take their roles; disfiguring Aemond years before, acting as message runner for the Blacks (including going north to secure the help of Cregan Stark) and then be killed by Aemond over Storm's End. The early fighting in the Riverlands between houses Blackwood and Bracken will be cut, as will the entire plot with the Triarchy that ends with the Battle of the Gullet. The Fishfeed will be the first major battle we see, fought by Cregan Stark and his winter wolves instead of Roderick Dustin, though he'll manage to survive. He'll also be the one who goes about the Butchers' Ball, and has Criston Cole killed off so satisfyingly anticlimactically. Hm, though now I say that, they might decide it's _too_ anticlimactic, and have him actually fight a duel with Stark instead.  The various battles of Tumbleton will be merged together, with "Ulf the Hammer" changing sides only to be killed fighting "Addam Oakenfist". Rhaenyra will still go ahead with ordering Nettles's death, Daemon and Aemond will still kill each other over the Gods' Eye. I think we'll also lose the Lads (pity, since I rather like them), and the battle of the Kingsroad will be fought by Cregan Stark and his characters leftover from the Fishfeed, with perhaps the inclusion of Black Aly Blackwood if we're lucky.  That's about it for me. What do you guys think they'll do with it?
All there going to do is F=€7 up the last season or go woke AF. Id wait and never see this show until its finished.
WE WUZ VALYRIANS
Big. Meh.
Don't screw this up for me.
Black Targaryen's? Yeah this ain't gonna be woke huh? 🤣🤣🤣
who wants a prequel when you know how it all ends?
Wwooooo!!🥳🥳
Fix & reboot season 8 please #jonisking
Not sure I feel like watching it after game of thrones disaster ending with Daenerys  We go throughout many year to 💩 ending
It's not based on any books, and it's a prequel. Booooooo
Game of thrones are coming back guys 🌋
All I wanna see is Cregan Stark fight Aemon the Dragon knight
lol look at that :D black Velaryons with white dradlocks :D its like they are trying how much will people tolerate :D
Considering how badly HBO botched the last season of Game of Thrones, I have zero interest.
hyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyype!
Wooooo! Go team blacks and the rightful ruler of westeros
Imagine giving them a second chance
At least this time there's enough source material to not run out of...
I'll not hate on the producers of Game of Thrones this time. But I want to emphasize what kind of a possibility the new ones have with this gem. You have a crowd bigger than most TV Shows ever had, I hope you don't disappoint. In case you're doing great please finish GoT, I can't wait for Season 7 and 8.
I smell Emmys nominations and winning 👀
Shoulda put the money into redoing season 8. No hype for this.
I cannot freaking wait!!
Chills! I cannot fing wait!!!
Is that Ramsay Bolton doing the voiceover?
Targaryens are the best
❤️❤️
Ah no thanks. You screwed up the last one. Pass! The world has moved on.
Im so hyped
I'll watch because you hired my boy Matt.
It isn't being done by those two jackasses who ruined the last two seasons of their last show because they were too busy being excited about the Star Wars trilogy they lost because of Game of Thrones screwing up is it?
Number 1 on trending 🔥
I hope Matt Smith doesn't ruin this like he did with Doctor Who. Before Smith, The Doctor was a witty, calculated, charismatic genius who always had a plan. Then Smith entered the fold and The Doctor became a bumbling idiot who has short spells of genius.
i have a bad feeling this is going to be very PC.
Please tell me its not the same fucking writers
If this show will be just as good as the first 6 seasons of GOT then we’re in for a real treat
Why a Got prequel ,? would have preferred a decent season 8 ending.
Harry potter and House of the dragon in 2022 It's really amazing year 🔥
I'm exited but mot that much since we were supposed to get the Long Night series.
8 Million by tonight. Game of Thrones is back ladies n gents!
Fire and Blood
Where are the dragons though?
Can’t wait for most of the seasons to be goated and have the last season be total garbage
Weak trailer
Is that young ned's voice? Also this looks like a china made GoT lol
Valyrian blood changed a lot...
Fortunately Dumb and Dumber didn't touch this one
Matt Smith deserves a starring role in anything.
Why is Ramsey narrating the trailer?
At least we will have some Targaryens to cheer for now
THE ADVENTURES OF DUNK & EGG would have been better....or the age of heroes
Well they'll screw it up after the first few seasons.
The first season is about dance of the dragon, the civil war. Fight for throne between rhaneyra and aegon II
Sorry but that last season{and that last episode} has left such a bad taste in my  mouth that i won't be watching this one. Besides we all know how it ends for this family.........
Plz plz Hindu Bubbies Release Official
Plz plz Hindu Bubbies Release Official
Is that Ramsey Boltons voice I hear?
Plz plz Hindu Bubbies Release Official
Plz plz Hindu Bubbies Release Official
Bruh if you have the budget just redo the final season instead of milking the franchise
So did the iron throne get a haircut in between this and the first season of GOT or is this more of an adaptation of George’s book rather than a prequel to the show?
Damn it. I have to buy a new tv again now.  P.S: i always bought a new tv with every GOT season renewal.
Как так то?(  Почему Эйгона " это кажется он" играет белый, а не черный?  Где толерантность?
❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful trailer.. but this will always remind me of the terrible last season like a bad headache
Just don't get those two idiots who made the final season of GOT and I'd be happy
If only the last GoT season was good This teaser would be even bigger
If you think this will have good ratings, You haven’t been paying attention..
I wish watching this didn't remind me of the disaster that was the ending of GoT. I automatically look at this with some amount of disdain or aversion even if it might be as good as (or even better than) GoT.
Why youtube didn’t recommend this to me. And I had to find out my own. Youtube fix your algos. I like this shit.
Seeing the dance will be cool as hell
Cant wait 🔥the fire will reign🔥
Can't believe how little I care about this. Season 8 killed all my love for GOT. Can't even bring my self to rewatch the good seasons.
I always felt bad that dragons were used as accessories to war and not treated as rare and beautiful creatures
He sounds like Ramsay Bolton
Eleventh Doctor:  "We're all stories in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?"  Game of Thrones S8 writers: "Umm..."
Sending support
Don't let the cancel culture affect this show how they did GoT post Sansa-Ramsay scene. All of a sudden there was no nudity, no violence and no hard hitting scenes to please the snowflakes.
OHHHH YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS CANT F*N WAIT , now we have trailer ..HELL YA 👍👍👌👌
10 years we were all watching GOT and for what ? to be spat in the face with the biggest anticlimactic ending ever ?. And did they really think that after a few years we would all forget about the final season which destroyed what could of been the best TV show ever created ?. I will never ever forgive D&D or HBO for ending such a beloved show so fucking poorly, so poorly that it qualified as a cinematic crime. I will not waste any of my time watching spin offs, of one of the biggest "fuck you !" in TV history, fuck everything and anything to do with GOT, shit makes my blood boil.
Bro did I just shit myself??? By the way why do I see black ppl??? What are they doing in there. .....ps I am black by the way but no we dont belong here
The throne looks so much more fierce and powerful.
0:39 lol wtf thats howarts
Ofc there will be a black guy with white rastas🤣🤣🤣
spend less on dragons and more on good writers
This is like the 20th time I am watching this.... 😭
My only question: Are dumb and dumber steering this boat as well???
who is writing this? if it's from the same team as the other one...aaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahah 😂
i dont waste my time again with a gameof thrones series. U destroy the main serie so why schould we trust u again that u not destroy it now again?
Hope they dont ruin this
We gon see a lot of incest, aren't we?
AVISA QUE JA HITOU
"Still not ginger!"
better not fuck this up like you did with the last season of  the GoT
I am so pumped for this show. Anyone who's read Fire and Blood knows that the Dance of the Dragons is such a cool story line with so many great moments. I cannot wait to see Daemon, Rhaenyra, Aegon the Second, Aemond One-Eye and Ser Criston Cole on screen. I am especially excited about seeing dragons on screen. I can't wait to watch Balerion, Vhagar, Caraxes, Sunfyre, Silverwing, Vermithor, etc. on screen. Reading Fire and Blood has made me so excited to watch dragons and dragonriders
Wait a minute...were there black targaryens?
No thanks
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Look we don't know the starting nut we know the end. We are GOT universe we will watch with full excitement 😂😂😂
I’m still bitter they destroyed GOT’s ending. Not sure I’ll invest this time
Can't wait
Lol as if the entire GoT universe isn't completely dead!
PLEASE WRITE THE ENDING BEFORE YOU GET THERE
hopefully not the same bozos that ruined the final seasons of GoT if so then this is expected to be TRASH
Don't fuck it up again 🥺
Meh I'm not excited, game of thrones ruined any future excitement with the terrible final seasons, if it's good I'll watch it but it won't get excited like I was the first time around. We will see how it plays out.
Don't do that... don't give me hope.
ok now find 2 writers that will get bored at 70% of the show and will want to try something new
MY LIFE FOR THE HORDE
Ready to see the G.O.A.T Daemon
Hbo Max is not letting up.
200 yes before and still same tech?? Disgusting.
If only those last few seasons of game of thrones didn't suck, I would have been excited for this show, now I don't care at all.
Can't wait for the last season to mess it all up
Finally, a throne forged from a thousand swords.
So this is a prequel for GOT?
Seeing the throne more properly done, twaser of (possibly) THAT jousting tournament, I have high hopes for this show as long as they follow the book it cant mess up
🔥🔥🔥🎉
Just dont screw it up like the final season
Hmmm not sure I hope it has its own feel...please be really good this is all I have
Everyone pretending like GoT was trash because of 1 disappointing final season ah ah, classic internet. Can't wait till people get pissed this show doesn't go the way you want it after praising it to the heavens ^^
Oh look at the set and costumes!! And GRRM is involved, this will be epic.
Spoilers, Everybody dies
🦇️🔥
Horrible. Complete shit. Completely taken and subdued by the shoveddownthethroat forced diversity hazardous trash. Black targaeryans? Really???? "Unnecessary" is an eufemism.
looking forward to not pay you any subscription!!! still remember last season!!! We do not forgive especially without apology!!! arrrrr...
പീറ്റർ ബെയ്‌ലിഷിൻറെ മരിക്കാത്ത ഓർമകൾക്ക് മുന്നിൽ പ്രണാമം !
Is it just me or the narrator sounded just like Ramsay Bolton?🧐🧐🤔🤔
After what happened to the night king i don't care about this show
Is Ramin Djawadi on board?
Who is directing?
👍👍👍
Narrator voice sound like Iwan Rheon (Ramsay Bolton)
Better not be the same writers. And better be a story of how the Targaryans conquered Westeros.
Nah, me and most ppl lost all interest with the last season of GOT. This is gonna flop hard...
0:38 Are those Blk Targeryans, are there such people in the books?  I hope the show isn't going full blown woke and just checking off the diversity boxes for diversity sakes,
Где драконы але
😰😰😨😀😀
Не понятные комментарии, на тарабарском каком-то
Game of thrones prequel? Huh, never watched it/heard of it. Should I watch it?
Everyone dies in squid game lol, and the old man is the mastermind behind it
I bet there won't even be a dragon in this show!
A HBO original series*
Untold story of tyagrajans 😅
yesssss!!!
I still hurt I don't know if I'm going to bother with this franchise at all.
Great gift on my birthday 😁
I won't watch anymore HBO crap until George RR Martin releases the damn books
Keeping my expectations low...at this point i only trust in George RR Martins writing for this universe.
Looks good hope it doesn’t turn out shit
Shall we begin 🔥🐉🐲🐉🔥
I’m so hyped 🤯
House of the Dragon: Albinos of Evil
Plz plz plz hindi dube🙏🙏🙏🙏
They better have some real writers for this one... hopefully ones that didn't lie their way into the job like D&D did.
Don't tell me you are gonna f*ck this one too
Dw we remembered what happened when you tried to write your own scipts and develop your own storyline.
I'm not prepared for another disappointment.
HBO, you can redeem yourselves. Don't eff this up. You fixed the iron throne, yay!!!
🔥🔥🔥
We all know the finale it's going to suck like GOT lol
Cool  Redo seasons 7 & 8
Really hope they plan to take their time with the whole series on this one, like they did for the first few seasons of Game of Thrones.
Please please please don't disappoint me 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Literally can't wait to see how they're gonna screw up this one 😍 Wait... Wrong emoji 🤬 Now we go 😡🤬😡🤬
God damn it they're going to suck me back in aren't they...
Can I participate may God reward you paradise 🤲🤲
i really think the whole franchise learned their lesson from the last season of GOT. and I think this show will exceed our expectations. ready to be back in westeros!
🤓🤓
fingers crossed they dont screw this up
As long as they keep those season 8 writers out the way I'm all in. 👍
Good luck getting people to trust you again on a show like this. Not happening
As long as dumb&dumber have nothing to do with this show i will watch....
:49 seconds 👀
The Princess and the Queen, or The Blacks and The Greens
I still haven't gotten over the fact that they've fucked up GOT. I'm still not ready for a commitment.
I hope they don't fuck this up too
There’s definitely a chance for Melisandre to return given the fact she’s 400 years old
Please don't fuck it up like Season 8 i beg you
https://youtube.com/shorts/UKfq7vjPDxA?feature=share
Please Don't Make Mistakes Again Like Ending Game of Thrones from the start, an epic story has been built with very strong and feared opponents and has gone around looking for allies. eh, the Night King period, just like that, it was defeated so easily, it really felt like I wanted to slam my tv.
What? No dragons?
No purple eyes🙁🙁
So, apparently there is an African American targeryen. So a white summer islander???
I am trying soooo hard not to get pulled back in after how GoT ended... but DAMN!
Please don't botch the ending to this -
I'm stoked to have westeros back in my life
Самый лучший Доктор, так вот куда ты делся !!!
такое себе, даже мурашки не побежали по телу
I want to write a comment but can't because of all this excitm
Can't wait
I'LL BE DAMNED IF THEY RUSH THIS ONE TOO.
Well, it can't be worse than Season 8 and highly unlikely better than Season 1 (which is extremely re-watchable).
Hard pass
Prequel doesn't matter as it all leads to GOT S8. Nothing can salvage it, nothing.
I’m so hyped for the Velaryons!!!!!
Wao!! Porfin!!
God damnit, I swore I was through with any ASOIAF HBO adaptations after the dumpster fire of the main series. But I’m kinda on board. The Iron Throne shot gave me chills.
I need to finish reading the book before this comes out
omg they gave me the first teaser as a birthday present ❤️❤️❤️
My pants are soaked. I fucking love Dragons 🐉
Coming up on Looper: 10 things you missed in the teaser of House of the Dragon
I can't...not again I'm not strong enough :'(
why did the narrator sound like Ramsey
Looks good. Just don't mess up the ending this time
I just wanna see matt😅
Omg!! Can’t wait!!
I think for my sanity, I can not get emotionally invested with this.GOT really screwed with my head for 10 years. Sorry, not sorry
Please don't fuck it up.
This makes me happyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!
The first spin off Game of Thrones. Very excited
Now just don't catastrophically fuck it up right at the end this time.
"BURN THEM ALL!"
Doctor who is in Games of Thrones! Let’s go
Manuela Olivera
I can't decide whether or not to be excited. the original series sustained me for years but the final season left my heart broken.
if this gets messed up then there's gonna be no other option than to reboot the entire canon
I see trailer and the only thing that comes to mind is.... Haven't you got any decent food? You're Scottish, fry something.
Keep the two writers from the original away from this series and it should be fine. Gosh when I think back to the last season of GOT I just get so pissed still. Anyone of us could have come up w a better ending.
Now we know where the Doctor went
Dracarys
No thanks.
Excited and apprehensive. Hope you guys don’t FIU
Caralhoooooooo arrepiadaaaaaaaa 😍
So they’re trying to make us watch a series about a family with no legacy and no decendents but a deserter in the present story line? How fun is that!  Probably watching it anyways 🤦🏻‍♂️
Oooh, can't wait! Fire will reign. 🔥🔥🔥
are you going to build this up like you did GoT then slowly kill its momentum toward the end by rushing it?
Another prequel sick
There is a bit of *K4|_erg1 plan* in your TV show.
Am I the only one who feels this voice belongs to Joseph Morgan🙉
ah shit, here we go again.
A black Velaryon? I just checked out. Do these woke people have to infect everything?
Winds of Winter: Am I a Joke to you
That voice is Richard Madden right?
Two hundred years earlier and no differences. Pathetic stagnation.
Haven't watched any of the games of thrones and wont be watching this either because there no point for me i wont understand any of it and don't have a tv anyway my life as turned into crap now i have no joy in life left for me to do just get up and watch the time slowly go past and worry when the next bill will come in lol
Aaaaaalaaaaveeeerr!!!!!!
This kinda looks ... too woke for me.
I will give this definitely a shot after 8.. sorry 7 seasons of GoT, everybody deserves second chance again. Dont fail us HBO
Hbo should also make a show about Starks as well  next Maybe which shows the background of the night king
LETS GOOOOO
We are house STARK ! Sorry HBO
I’ll watch it, but mannnn I can’t forget how dirty they did my girl Dany... it’s kind of like, what’s the point of watching the prequel when you know that there won’t be a single Targaryen alive 200 years later and only one dragon (Drogon) alive with no rider? (And no, I don’t count Jon Snow because he’s not 100% Targaryen and he grew up a Stark.)
I heard old Georgie is going to write all the episodes of season 2 and he is about to release 4 more Dunk & Egg books the last one ending with a massive cliffhanger with three more Trilogy books to end the series, he said he predicts to start working on 2028. George is an incredibly committed writer. xD
Обосруться как и с властелином колец(
Omg
وش ذا لعبه ولا فلم ولا وشو
Still bugs me that the Targaryen eyes are not purple.  It a big deal, but it's just one of them small details that make their house stick out from the others. If you can make it look night time on that beach, you can color some eyes
People in chat act like GoT didn't went to shit before the final season
Fuck this one up like you did with the last season of Game of Thrones and I'll never forgive you HBO.  Of course I'll still subscribe because you have South Park locked down. But I won't forgive if you screw this up by putting it in the hands of another Dan and Dave. As soon as they got some attention they gave up and got lazy with GoT and were already looking forward to their next project.
HBO acting as if the fans forgot the ending of game of thrones.
Doesn’t really show anything
Looks promising! Ending better not be SH*T and just leave the last season like they didn't give an F. They did Daenerys dirty and I am still salty about it.
Yo I think we in the clear. This is hundreds of years before bad plot existed.
You people are so easily pleased...
LOL I would’ve watched this shit but I’m not gunna. White walkers and the night king made this universe great with their mystery and strength. Knowing how the main series ended there’s no point to even watch this
Fool me once shame on you
Sim, sim e sim!
Ahh Mr. Moqorro finally we can meet you.. :D
0:18 dragon??
Everybody gangsta until Amazon's Lord of the Rings release.

What was the status of white walkers at that time
Oh my GOOOOOOOOOODDD!!!
Benioff and Weiss are not involved that's all I had to know.
HBO shows are on Sky Atlantic here in the UK so i imagine this will be too.
All the people bitching , You don't have to watch it! Fuckin take a leap
Omg omg omg omg omg !!!!!!!!!!!!!)$
My body has never been more ready!
I need hindi dube plz🙏🙏🙏🙏
HBO please promise me you won't bring back those losers that ruined  the last 2 seasons of game of thrones Then take my money 💰💰💰💰
Yes
Классические Валирийские умба юмбы .
Given the casting, I wonder what colors the dragons are going to be...
Hindi dube plz
Daenerys my beloved they did you wrong !
No thanks! They botched the finale
Cant wait to see what season they decide to say 'fuck it' in this show.
Can't wait! One of the most interesting parts of this world.
It sounds very very very good. But I dare you.. It won't be like Game of thrones!
Slay me khal drogo 💦
Excited to see Balerion!!
This will be amazing, and all the season 8 haters will be the first ones  to watch this
.mg.
I'll approach this with very cautious optimism after how Game of Thrones ended.
I’m not super excited, since I’d prefer a remake of GOT last season
You can`t disappoint me again. I know how it ends HAHAHA
It's about time they know about Targaryen supremacy
We have soft reboots, so why can’t we have something where we redo the last couple seasons of a show? It would be groundbreaking!
Lets call this... HOD. After   GOT
Any white walkers in this one?
HBO, listen. What you did to me with Game of Thrones is something that I will never even recover from. Absolutely shameless. I therefore cant watch this series before its completely over and you didn't absolutely trash it to bits and pieces. Have you seen Game of Thrones yourself dude? No shot
Balerion looks so much like Drogon. As he should.
Game of thrones is dead thanks to dumb and dumber
Pointless cash cow...
Let there be FIRE !!!!!!!!!!
I'm so freaking excited omg
Still not over the final season. How can I watch this show knowing how fucking stupid they finished Daenarys story
The special effects shouldn't be that hard or expensive. It's not like they have dire wolves or anything.
И в чем смысл ? Мы и так это знаем , мы видели что будет в будущем . На ху я ?
Hey it’s Matt Smith! Shame I’m not into this series but hope all of y’all who are enjoy his performance!
Were is the love button
Targs are black now? Kay
No, non stai sognando
MORTAL KOMBAT !!!!🎶🎶
Idk look wierd and cheap , and who writing this one , sry hbo we never forget ...but hey 17 dragons uuu clap dummies, but it was never about dragons at all achh i give it chance but my expectations are super low , win me over hbo i dare you
cast look boo boo
Wow, Black ppl on the show?
Fuck me up, this is amazing! I cannot wait!!! HOUSE TARGARYEN
I'm ready to be hurt again
Wow
After the atrocity that was GoT's last seasons, I don't see how anyone would be foolish enough to invest their time into this franchise again.
Aaaaaaa
залупень какая нибудь будет .
എന്റെ പൊന്നു അണ്ണന്മാരെ , കാശില്ല എന്നും പറഞ്ഞുകൊണ്ട് Game Of Thrones അവസാനിപ്പിച്ചത് പോലെ ഇതും അവസാനിപ്പിക്കരുത്, ഇതിൽ ഒരുപാട് പ്രതീക്ഷയുണ്ട് , മലയാളികൾ ആരെങ്കിലും കണ്ടാൽ ഒന്ന് മൈൻഡ് ചെയ്തേക്കണം, അല്ലാതെ ഇവരോട് മലയാളത്തിൽ പറഞ്ഞിട്ട് ആര് കേൾക്കാൻ, ആര് കാണാൻ

Nobody Cares anymore
Looks pretty meh tbh, no scenes with large scale wars or anything? Or any dragons? I really hope it's not a drama just based on the characters personalities.
This is your chance at redemption HBO
White hair means you can't be burned by the fire of a dragon.
How many dragons will we need for this series? HBO: Yes.
Will they ruin this again?  Not like I have any expectations.....
Can’t wait for another Targaryen to get mad and burn down a city :) such hype
Great, another GoT to be extremely disappointed in its eventual ending
Ooooohhhhh 😮😯😲😱
MY BODY IS READY
Can't wait to not watch this!
Dreams didn't make us Kings, Dragons did...  - House Of Dragon 🐉
https://youtu.be/ycEwhzJR7ls
well it's not like HBO has squandered source material from the same author before, I can't imagine this starting good and becoming bad or anything like that
D&D have nothing to do with this, so you’ll can shut up about season 8 from almost 3 years ago.
*Long NAAAAGHT* 🥳💯🏛🔥🐲🤌🏽
alalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalal
Part of me is like do we really need to consume more media that perpetuates aryan beauty and power? The other side is like well they added their token black guy so… cool I guess? I know it’s just a story. But can we stop putting out stories that reinforce these aryan saviors? It’s 2021.
since GOT is over I waited for this and very excited, why HBO MAX is not available yet in Saudi Arabia we want to see the spranos and another HBO series we can't .
I cannot wait!!! I got chills... I'm pumped to see the dragons!
I see the cancerous race changing of the witcher has slightly touched this.
laino
Must of lost his tardis
Yes!!!! I cant wait!!!!
OMG
after all of this nightmare, the only binge I'm looking forward to
Please don't let dumb and dumber write... Please
😴 please make sure to release 2022 first week can't wait shit
Are Dumb and Dumber still the showrunners? Christ Almighty, tell me they're not still the showrunners.
Okay blood fire kings dragons and blablabla how about the word "good ending" any idea ?
Don't give me hope like this, I can't take a second heartbreak when the writers just wing it eight seasons in.
house of boobies. because ratings. realtalk
The show runner Ryan condyl is a big fan of the books. His interviews show how much of a book nerd he is so I think the issues we had with D&D will be non existent here. I have faith that this show is gonna do the dance of dragons justice 😊
Season 8 of GOT still hurts
Нуу даже не знаю, последний сезон игры престолов был таким куском дерьма, что я сомневаюсь, буду ли я смотреть новый сериал
i love everything game of thrones ill watch this
I sooo don’t like the typical music in this trailer. So not original, just like from any catastrophe-thriller-and-whatnot movie trailer.
Looks even worse than season 8! oh look it even has a lot of season 8's production and writing team too.
Different writers this time, y’all have nothing to worry about. Also, yes… there will be a shit ton of dragons, GRRM confirmed it.
After season 8, I dont have much faith in this series.
Malayalis Comon✌✌
More bums and chest reveals throughout the series.
So this is what the 11th doctor did before he regenerated again
If it wasn't for that damn ending I'd be so much more Hyped
Was that whoopi goldberg as a targaryen? lol
After GoT turned out shit my expectations aren't very high.
daenerys went crazy at the end of Season 8 of GOT.  Targaryen's go crazy.  why were people surprised?  she was the mad queen
എൻ്റെ മോനെ തീ ആവും
A pretty looking teaser…which is all just build up for the trash can fires of the last 2 seasons of GoT 😝😂😭
"Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons Did."   True. The only reason the North made Robb King in the North was because the Dragons were dead and they didn't want to bow to some other King.
Just waiting for Caraxes vs Vhagar
200 YEARS BEFORE THE TIME WE RUINED GAME OF THRONES
I have to kind of forget seasons 7 and 8 of GOT to be able to watch this.
i'm sorry i didn't receive my copy of the APOLOGY
whats the point? we all know how the story goes :D :D :D (wet fart)
Hamme
YES ❤️❤️❤️
1080p, really HBO?
🔥🔥🔥
BatChest YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHEEEEEEWWWWWW
they should make a series about Euron and his time away from the westeros
I see Matt Smith in thumbnail I click.
As long as dumb and dumber don’t write this it will be fine
Очередной Говно шедевр
amazingggg
They can make an entire new show, yet won't give us a new and better season 8. Why should I care about this?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 so Season 8, shall we talk about it or are you going to act as if it never happened? Go away, please.
I hope this show is good, I hope it’s successful, most of all i hope they put a lot of thought into the final season
Can't wait for the final season to disappoint
MAAAATTTTTTT SMIIIIITTTTTTHHHHHH
Just hold D&D as far as possible from this show, and everything should be alright.
Yup. This sure is a thing that's happening. For some reason.
❤️❤️❤️
Try not to screw this one up.
The black looks very poor on my oled screen. Is this only due to first YouTube teaser? Please check the mastering of the black
Wow the iron throne actually looks book accurate
скоро мы вернемся в королевскую гавань!..... 🤗
I’m watching in hopes it’ll give me feelings that seasons 1-5 gave me
Prince Philip before he married Lizzie.
Wtf a black Targaryen ? What’s is all this progressive  shite
0:46. "Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did". Bitch, could you remind me why your family migrated to Westeros? And you had dragons before moving to Westeros, and you weren't kings, so...
Really looking forward to this, as long as it doesn't turn out to be house of the woke instead.
I would rather they did Roberts rebellion as a spin off
You thought the wait was over, but its only just begun
This looks terrible lol
Yeaahahhhhh I was waiting for this show Best news of the year😁😁😁❤️❤️♥️♥️
black valyrians in westeros hahahaha
Ah yes, more Targaryens, more dragon and even more incest...
Well, I’m here for it.
Why every single trailer is the same? Looks so stupid
Ehhhh... Thanks, but no thanks.
We should've gotten the real final season of game of thrones than this in my opinion. I hope the series is great, but I still want that good ending.
Please tell me its not the same writers as GoT last season
The black targaryen lmao. This says so much.
PERFEITOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Meh, after the incredible letdown that was the GoT ending, I will pass. HBO never should have green lit an adaptation from books that were not completed.
I can't wait. I'm so excited 😊 🤗!!!!!. I'm hoping for a great run.
I’m very cautious after the last two season of GoT. Also the diversity castings are just so dumb.
Hey the iron throne looks like how it's described in the books! 😀
Comme pour Game Of Thrones, c’est hyper sombre même en m’étant la luminosité au maximum d’un iPhone 12. Aucune leçon de retenue depuis l’épisode avec les marcheurs blancs
OMG! OMG!! OMG!!!
This looks epic! Prequels are the only way for game of thrones to survive after the horrible season 8. We all know there's never gonna be a season 9 because all of those actors  are never coming back, but I believe a season 9 could fix the crap we got in season 8...in saying that there are tons of material that could make many prequels for years to come
Now I'm toooooo much desperate about it 😍😍😍😍😛🤩🤩🤩🤩
Waiting for the date
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Did i just see a black Targaryen?
Are those D&D douches involved in this?
WE WUZ MUHFUGGING TARGAREANS AN SHIIIEEEEETT CUUHHHH
black targaryen?
Yo, is this strictly a Targaryen story or are there gonna be Starks and Lannisters in here as well?
After the disappointment of GOT I'm going to have to hear very good things about this before I watch it.
Take my money. Let’s do this.
Looks cheap and bad
Nope.
CANT WAIT !!!
all you people complaining about season 8 are gonna be glued to the TV's when this comes out just like we were for the original stop fronting :)
Hyped
MATT SMITH!!!
Let’s hope that this turns out like Better Call Saul and surprise us
Wait a minute, black Targaryeans?? They look so cool
But are all these dragon riders going to forget about the Iron Fleet??
Sooooooooo exiiiitedddddddddd  “ dreams didn’t make us kings , dragons did 🐉🐉🐉”
This looks neat, but I find it kinda hard to care. I cared about what was happening 200 years from now, but that shit itself in the end, so why should I be excited for this? That being said, I'm going to try to remain optimistic. I hope this is good.
Having Rob Stark narrate this makes me fucking sick.
I can't wait to see this show.  Give me more🤗
too bad yall kill GoT
I LOVE that they changed the iron throne to look more book accurate, I have high hopes for this show. Everything I see and hear from it makes me more excited.
I’m really hopeful. This seems to be adapting a very interesting part of Westeros history and has some good talent behind it. I will gladly give this a chance
I am watching this with low expectations. Very low...
Doctor who?
to anyone who's not interested cos you didn't like Season 8:  we don't care! leave us
¿donde estan los pinchys dragones? :@
Meh
Игра престолов?🤔
HBO : Did you see The Night King ? Me : No . . . . . I saw The Dagger that Killed Him :) 0:41
Ah, a new GoT show based on another unfinished series of books.  What could possibly go wrong.
IM HAPPY FOR MATT SMITH
😍😍😍😍😍
We waz Targaryens and Shieeeeeet
Fuck this show i tried to audition
It’s so annoying watching people still complain about season 8 two years later when this show has absolutely nothing to do with D&D. Shut the fuck up about season 8 already!
People are funny with their "the last season ruined Game.of Thrones" comments.  No it didn't.  Was the ending less than satisfactory?  Yes.  But it didn't take away from the brilliance of the previous years.  Seinfeld's conclusion was terrible but it is still considered by many to be the greatest sitcom ever.  Looking back, how many great series had a perfect ending?  I can only think of Breaking Bad.  GoT was a phenomenal series, overall one of the best ever.  As for the ending...get over it
Omg omg omg
*It's like seeing your old toxic ex who ruined your relationship and part of your life coming back like if nothing happened without an apology and being like "heyyyyy, let's get together again"*

Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch! Yaaaaaaaassssssss!
YAWN!!
I'm giving it a chance since Benioff and Weiss aren't involved. And since they have a more complete framework, hopefully they can deliver a show that is far more consistent in quality, and high quality at that. I will hype this up responsibly.
Woow amo demasiado!!
Well you fucked us all with the last season. Not getting hyped for this!
Okay, who wants to make guesses at what some of these flashes of action are?  (SPOILERS FOR STUFF FROM THE FIRE & BLOOD BOOK ENCOURAGED IN THE REPLIES)  0:37 Criston Cole in a melee at the tourney in 111?   0:41 Looks like what I'm guessing is Alicent Hightower with a dagger... if I'm guessing at what this is, I'm going to say it's her being pissed after Aemond loses his eye.  0:42 I had thought this could've been from the same 111 tourney.  Or maybe the tourney from 114 when Rhaenyra got married and Cole changes his allegiance.  The previous shot could also be from either tourney for all I know.  0:43 Oh, I bet this is Aemond and Lucerys fighting and Aemond's about to lose his eye.  I'm guessing that they condense the 111 and 114 tourneys into one event.  And probably move them to occur a little closer to the start of the war.  111 and 114 to 129 is a long gap, so I could see them shifting the timeline around to have fewer time jumps and make the story feel more immediate.  Or maybe doing more with flashbacks than GOT ever did.
Not a great teaser trailer,I am sure HBO will ruin this series with more woke wankery.
Dear HBO, please don't fuck it.
I'm actually really looking forward to Olivia Cooke! Loved her back in Bates Motel.
If it wasn’t for season 8 of Game of Thrones, I’d actually be really excited to watch this spin-off, but it’s tough to invest yourself in a show knowing the ending might be absolutely terrible
Look at all those pale skin Velaryons
Arrepiei até o cu
Dream's didnt make us king's, Dragons DID 🔥🔥
*Gerooonimoooooo*
The animators be sweatin' with bigger sizes and numbers of dragons flying all over the place and I salute them for bringing heavy fantasy to near real experience 🐲  And the wall, that frigging opening to the wall
Not gonna lie, a few years ago I would have been hyped for this show and now all I feel is apprehension 🤣 I'll probably give it a go when it's got a couple of seasons on air, if it manages that.
Just when I thought I was out... They pull me back in....
Well a prequel seems more of a plausible revival for the franchise than a remake of anitclimactic GoT season 8, this series could potentially lead to more prequels in the future.
People are completely forgetting season 8 of GoT and that George is incapable of finishing a series.
And I'm just wishing for the Civil War of Lions, (Soon to be) Lord Tywin Lannister vs Houses Reyne and Tarbeck
I believe HBO will make up for the disappointment of the final season of GOT.
This is gonna suck just like the last couple of seasons did. They ruined GOT
I got mixed feelings about this. I want to like it but then I remember season 8
nah
Trailer ain't looking bad. I'm glad someone fixed the lights for once.
Game of Thrones: Milking of the Dragon
My anticipation for this is weighted a little by the knowledge that people will take it as an opportunity to whine more about how game of thrones ended.
what’s with the black people in armor out of a sudden, is this another pathetic attempt at pushing woke stuff?
I'm interested in seeing the relationship between rhaenyra and aegon before the war actually begins. Gotta imagine she loved her little brother before things got ugly.
Who is hopping to see the hudge dragon we saw as skeleton alive ?? 🔥🐉
Given how terrible GoT turned out in the end I think everyone's expectations are next to dinosaur bones by now.
The Doctor goes back to the time of Dragons. I'll watch that
This trailer was so good!! As a huge fan of Game of Thrones I’m excited for this since the announcement
I didn't see Geralt or Yennefer once in this trailer, what the hell?
After watching season 8 of Game of Thrones, I wasn't willing to watch the prequel but after watching this, damnnn... There's no way I'm missing it!
This feels like a trap...
I just had one of those fridge/shower moments when you randomly realise something. The Velaryons fall from grace and the fact that they “diluted” their Valyrian blood with Summer Islander would be taken as proof of the inferiority of their blood by other Valyrian families (in show only, as we don’t see Velaryons in GoT).  On the plus side, they look great!
DREAMS DIDN'T MAKE US KING, INBREEDING DID.
الي عربي من محب عالم غيم اوف ثرونز يثبت وجوده هنا.
Please be good.
The amount of views this got in such a short amount of time is incredible!
عظمه 🤯🤯🤯🔥😭😭🔥😭🔥🤯😭🤯😭🤯🤯😭🤯😭😭😭😭
WHY THE DRAGON HAS FOUR LEGS?????????
Is it just me or is it super obvious that that night scene was shot during the day and nightified?
GRRM no WoW, me no House of the Whatever...
Just came here to give it a dislike tbh
Black Targaryens??? How can it be? Tolerastick sh...t
الحماس ↖️↖️↖️↖️↖️
Super Blonde Matt Smith in da hizous!
🖤🖤🔥 *It will be greater* waiting😌😌
I've heard they've rehired Dan & Dave for season 2 🙄......nor just kidding could you imagine
💥💥💥💥
PASS!!! after the way the last series has murdered Im no longer going to invest in any GOT series, it's all be ruined for me.
is that a fucking black targaryen
Kinda hard to feel hyped for this after the note GoT ended on.
So are we all just going to pretend the last 3 seasons of GoT didnt happen?
Lol, absolute garbage and you have people creaming themselves over a nothing trailer after the diaster which was the last series.  The IQ really has declined for the general population.
omg chills
in thumbnail it looks like barney stinson and lily are in it from HIMYM :P

HBO is betting on shitty cgi dragons instead of good writing to carry this show but prove me wrong
Please just don't rush -- we're okay with the 3 episodes traveling from Winterfell to the throne over the 10 minute teleportation sequences of the last season.
Love to see Olivia Cooke making an appearance.
So you are going to make an another epic series and you will tell us how a series can get  worst ending
reminder that there were only 4 good seasons of game of thrones
when village of the damned becomes a trend
Ооооо как я ждавааааалллл
i cant wait..... to seee the dragons in the season finale......
As long as Dumb and Dumber wasn't part of any of this then it should be really good.
We don't need this.   We want season 7 8 to be corrected
തീ... ഐറ്റം...🔥🔥
:D
Please don't hurt me like GOT did...
❤
can the fans stop crying about GOT last season. we get it you have opinions. I'm just grateful we have more GOT content
Good job screwing it up before its even done. Valerians aren't black, diversity for diversitys sake strikes again.
Wait are they doing another book series that isn't technically finished yet? Let's see how it works out for them this time.
Well a prequel seems more of a plausible revival for the franchise than a remake of anitclimactic GoT season 8, this series could potentially lead to more prequels in the future.
putain ils ont osé le spin-off de GOT :') c'est sans moiiiiii
Well I'm on  board!
im hot n ready like little cesars pizza for this show ><
I bet all those people in the trailer will die by season 1
Idc how old this is, I want Dany. NOW. THERE IS NO DRAGON. WITHOUT THE QUEEEEEEEN OF DRAGONSSSS
This was a solid teaser, I can't wait to see how may dragons they're going to show us in the full on trailer. I'm so excited to see Aemond riding Vhaegar at some point. Hopefully we get to see him tame him as well.
IM CRYINGN G IT LOOKS SO GOOD
Hype level is effectively zero after what happened with season 8.
Goosebumps!
That throne though 🔥
Would love to watch the making of the iron throne.
❤️❤️💛💚💚🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤💚💛🤍🤍🤎🤍🤍🤍🖤🖤🧡💛🤍💜🧡🤍🤍💚💙💚💛❤️💜💜🖤🤍🤎🤎💚💙💚🧡❤️❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜🧡💛💚🤎🤍🖤🖤💛💛💚💚
how can they expect us to wait after show us 0:44
Hopefully, we are going to enjoy this. Unless it's a rush like the last season of GOT.
GOT Writers if ur reading this plz dnt fuck this up 🙏🏼😂😂
Game of thrones was so bad that I'm not really hyped for this...
DAMNNNNNN 🔥🔥🔥
No but seriously why does that one actress at 0:30 look like the Walmart version of Emilia Clarke ?😂
IM SCREAMINGGGGG
Who owns the media? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg3Vnfu4Pk&t=1898s
Blackwashing yet another faction....Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
You should let us know in advance if you're going to butcher it like you did with the final seasons of GoT so I don't waste my time watching it and being disappointed later.
The helmets from the books? More swords for the sword throne??
I Love this.
I'm interested in seeing the relationship between rhaenyra and aegon before the war actually begins. Gotta imagine she loved her little brother before things got ugly.
ReMake SeaSon 7 & 8 ..
https://youtu.be/gRyMjte_cag 👈
MEU DEEEEUS ❤️❤️❤️
We all know how house Targaryen will end... so I doubt I'll watch... Still not over it.
Cobblers.
They look like witchers tbh
lol who cares about game of thrones
Diversity is the death of good tv...
8K
I’m so hyped!!!!!
By the time they do the Elric Saga no one will like it cause everyone has already told similar stories using things from the Melnibone empire and prince.
they already spoilt a great series with its ending.
I know this is just a teaser BUT so far, it looks amazing! I pray to the Old Gods and the New, PLEASE don't let this be a disappointment like the last 2 seasons of GoT.
Eagerly waiting to see balerion the dread. 🔥🔥🔥
i love that we are going to have earings in House of the Dragon, well done!
https://youtu.be/fNwwt25mheo
Game of thrones?
I saw the doctor I clicked gonna watch this just 4 him
HO LEE FUK! I am soooo ready!!!!
People are so negative and wanna see great content fail so bad lol that’s why they can’t enjoy anything. I loved season 8 of game of thrones and I’m gonna love this show too. I cannot fucking wait to see this it looks absolutely incredible!!!
I hope it'll gonna be excellent, not ruin like the GOT
Yeah, no. Not going to fall for this a second time.
https://youtu.be/uESotSeECIw
Knowing how it all ends … takes the excitement away
Чернокожий Таргариен, серьезно ?
Que emoción 🙆🔥🔥🔥🐲
The 0:37 Only this second is superior than all GOT season  8
Hope they don't fuck this one also i wanted the Blackfyre rebellion as a series or even Robert's rebellion but i guess this one is good too
I am waiting
Did Dumb and Dumber work on this show?
The Doctor is here to fix the broken hearts.
Forced Diversity at its finest!
YESSSS
HBO really need this to be good otherwise this franchise is dead.
0:39 😆😆😆😆😆
father of daenerys targaryen?
1 targaryan and three dragons were enough to make westeros kneel,this time its a family of them and 17 dragons,westeros is fucked
🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶
Whats this... House Velaryon is black people!?     Must WOKE destroy everything?
#GERONIMO
is it me or does it appear that there were ZERO technological advancements in 200 years? If you look at the difference between 1821 and 2021 we've come a long way. GOT takes place in 297 AC so NOTHING has changed since 97 AC?
Hahaha. They think this will start a franchise of spin-offs. Oh well, a slow death it is. I am sure gullible morons will think they are all "masterpieces", but these fools are oblivious to how dead movie and tv entertainment really are. History has also shown that prequels have a high rate of failure.
cant wait for it to turn out a shitshow like game of thrones did 💕
yeah, ill wait. We still wating on a public slapping of whomever was responsible for the most disappointing ending to one of the most popular tv shows ever. Get the actors and have them slap the responsble in the face until they cry. Win back your fans, slap them.
winter is coming...
oh good, about time they made a GoT Parody
one thing I dont like is they continued the pattern of white hair for the Targaryens. The targaryens all had a mixture of Silver and Gold coloured hair.
Fuck this is going to be disappointing, can't wait to hear people bitch about it because I damn-sure ain't watching it after the shitshow that was Game of Thrones.
We'd need Travis Fimmel to play as Damon Targaryen .
Fire and blood 🔥
I´m sooooooo hyped, I´m shaking
I'm ready for a good show to be ruined
Just waiting
Please don’t fuck this one up
Somebody get this man a fez!
Just one thing. Carolys Valyrion. Thanks for another shit show HBO
Hypeeeeee
Trailer: "Not from the same guys who ruined Game of Thrones." Everyone: "I'm in!"
If this show doesn’t have dragons in it, it’s already ruined.
House of the dragon with just three eggs left in the ending......😂
Is it the same writers or someone competent? Not gonna bother if its the same ones that ruined GoT.
Yesssss can't wait no more game of thrones withdrawal symptoms 🤣👍
After GOTs ending I just can’t care anymore. But I’ll be that guy anyways, why would you not make the series about the long night, the first men, Roberts rebellion, Aegons conquest, or literally fucking anything else besides the dance of dragons (I’m assuming that this is DOD but if I’m wrong I don’t care, point still stands)? Id take the adventures of Hotpie series before watching a series strictly dedicated to sister fucking genocidal maniacs. Danny burned children people, for no reason (in my opinion ((correct opinion)) that is). Yea let’s see where that mess came from. You know the great Ned Stark and his amazing family and traditions, yea fuck them, no one cares about the whole reason people got into the world of ice and fire to begin with (in my opinion). So I’ll say it, I think this will suck (because I’m a negative ass wipe but still). I hope I’m wrong and am indeed a retarded persons for believing I have any actual credible opinion. In conclusion! I’ll watch it. But if they fuck this up, Winter will never come. And don’t forget to remove the Starbucks cup from the shot you complete dip shits.
О божечки, завораживает😍
ഇത് കാത്തിരുന്ന മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ 🙂
"Fear me.. I've killed all of them"
I choose my plan. Telegram 🤗
No thanks! I just support house Targaryen because of Dany, the GOAT of literature and pop culture. I really dont care about these dead ancestors of Daenerys Stormborn.
vera level 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
يووووه 🔥🔥🔥
Только хотел сказать - где темнокожие братья? Оказывается - фух! Они на месте!)
No matter how good this show ends up being, it's still gonna be negatively affected by the ending of GoT. The whole time we watch this we'll know it all just leads to Dany forgetting about Euron's fleet and Bran becoming King.
Bend the knee. <3
"last season of GoT was shit" comments are coming....
Any chance we can get a redo of season 8? Maybe just a redo of the last episode?
This looks great so far.  Maybe in years to come you can redeem the original series by having them wake up to a different ending.
Keep D & D away of it please! Or hire them then fire them before the Final 2 seasons.  😂
Are you fucking kidding me right now ??
Matt Smith >>>>
Don’t f*ck it up…
Ehhh, the last season of GoT killed any excitement I have over this franchise.
What's with all the black people?
Life is too short to have managed expectations. I am aboard the HYPE TRAIN!
Atleast they got a good actor already. Cant wait to see more Matt Smith!
Matt Smith voice is just too good
When exactly???$
Don’t fuck this up
Cringe
While I wait for Winds of winter, I can do with this show.
So this is what the Doctor was doing for those years he went off the grid 🤔
Might watch it. Definitely won't renew my subscription for it though lul
Remember the Starks and The Night's Watch? Shadowbabies, magic priestesses, mysterious White Walkers and their zombie horde? Remember the direwolves, the wargs who control them, giants, the Children of the Forest and the one-eyed tree wizard? Remember the Faceless Men, the spunky child assassin and the banished maester that turned a giant sociopathic knight into a mindless killing machine? Yeah well, there will be none of that. Enjoy!
Can't wait to see how bad the last season of this show is.
HBO Max Please come in India with Hindi dubbed 🔥
Doctor
The halls looked really glorious as expected of house Targaryen at its peak. The Daenerys theme sent shivers through my spine
Could you please F@ck it up again?..you know, like last time. Many thanks
Nice to see one of the best Doctors get more work
I don’t think I’ve ever been so worried for a show to not suck then now
I was really hoping they did the iron throne from the books
GWB: Fool me once shame on you...fooled me! Can't get fooled again.
OK they better be dragons in this movie if not i will be pi’s
Its 2021 on YouTube and u look for a new Game of Thrones season: Ah lets turn up the qualit.....1080p 🙂 okay lets watch in FHD and 60 fp.... 30 is good 🙂
🔥🔥🔥
this looks like a witcher series , all of them are Geralt
I must say the Targaryens are beautiful but I’ll miss seeing the sliver hair in long braids like Daenerys had because of the Dothraki warriors.
Was waiting for this. OMG!
Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did. Chilling man. I cannot fucking wait for this to come out.
Gotta say, the expanded throne looks fucking amazing
Dear HBO is that all you got this trailer was corny 👀?
Yeah no. I'm not watching this until I know if the finale is good.
Who cares lul
Good.. but real enjoyer like https://youtu.be/sE0bjf7Qik0
tá mas cadê os dragões?
Awesome
GoT ending sucked. You all better make this phenomenal if you want people to stick.
Hey, HBO, fool me once
OHHH SHIEET 👀
از ایران صدای منو میشنوید یااااااا حسین😱😱😂😂😂
Don't rush it.
How about you redo season 8 instead?
😍😍
Exciting 🔥🤟🤟
The series no one asked for...
Wait black Targaryens were a thing ? (Genuine question)
When you order a new GOT series on Whish
I WANT TO BELIEVE.
what will be Netflix reaction about this?
I hope this one will have better ending than GOT had
YAAAAAAAAS
Well, looks good. thanks but no thanks though. Everything leads to GoT S8. Not to mention that Fire and Blood its the worst book in ASOIAF universe.
GODS.. KiNGS.. FiRE.. and BLOOD.. Dream didn't make us Kings.. DRAGONS DiD...
Oh shit!
Trailer looks promising. I hoping for the best...
ഡ്രാഗൺ🔥 🥚ഒരു ലോഡ് ഡ്രാഗൺ മൊട്ട വേണ്ടി വരും😏😁
I knew there would be black Targaryens. They just can't help themselves.
I was severely traumatized by the way GOT ended. The last couple of seasons were just so poor. I think that a lot of the drop off in quality had to do with the show outpacing the books. Here, we have a completely finished story and those of us who read the novellas this is based on already know the outcome. I’m hoping that makes for a much smoother execution. When it comes out, I’ll probably be a sucker and get HBO MAX to watch it just like millions of other people around the globe will.   Just take my money, HBO. Just take it!
I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS SERIES!! TY HBO!
Given how terrible GoT turned out in the end I think everyone's expectations are next to dinosaur bones by now.
Only 200 years ago? That would make Maester Aemon what, a teenager/young man or so? Hope he has a role!
If you all fall for this nonsense, and willingly watch this show after they destroyed a loyal and passionate fanbase's love, you deserve what you get.
I mean... I'll watch it, but I'm expecting to be let down at some point.
3 strikes and your out HBO… You got 2 left..  Valar Morghulis
Like many others... I really want to be excited.....but season 8 of GOT..... I don't know ...
Hmmm, ‘The fall of the throne’, I didn’t expect them to ever admit they fucked up the ending to GoT never mind admit on the trailer for their new show
Looking forward to it, however it'll be bitter sweet knowing all this story exists just for season 8 to ruin it.
Let’s fuckin’ go!
“Before the fall of the Throne.” Don’t remind people about that last season of Game of Thrones.
Fingers crossed that hbo doesn't let any clowns who worked on season 8 near this...
Woke version of game of thrones...dreadlocked Targaryens...
Why?
Ah shit...here we go again!
If this was 200 years before the destruction of the throne why is Viserys Targaryen back? Even though he died in season 1 of game of thrones I would have thought he would not have been born yet
What a lousy trailer
*grita como una perra loca *
Imagine how well this would do if they hadn't fucked up the HBO Game of Thrones series
I don't know boys, after that disastrous final season it's hard to get excited for anything GOT related
Why are some Targaryens black? Not accurate at all
Is that Daemon or viserys 1 ??
I mean, this is exciting, but just think how excited we’d all be if GOT had ended well…
Is that it????? 6 months for that ?????? You must be kidding me what garbage sort it out all this hype the shows gonna be garbage ,you watch 😂😂
I hope this does not 'Drag On' !! :D
This better have Cregan Stark, the hour of the wolf, the winter wolves and Roderick Dustin in it
GOT ended so bad that I felt nothing for this
🔥🔥🤩
0:37 whoa that's some awesome armor
Hause of woke shit
Omg it’s coming ✨✊
Se viene🔥🔥
Won’t watch after how they ended the series :/ sns
200 years before George Martin finished his books.
hahahah nobody cares about this property anymore. Bug off.
This will be ruined by wokeness
Nah thanks, I had my fill of GoT disappointments.
Brrraaa
Doctor came to save everyone
Black people playing a valyrian race LOL im sorry but im sure the actors are good but thats just ridiculous wigs they have on and every single valyrian was pale skin purple or dark blue eyes.
BURNNNN THEMMMM ALLLLLL
It just ain't the same anymore
Sadly my hair resembles the one from a Lennister, and not a Targaryen...
Gonna waste our time again by ruining the ending like game of thrones?
I didn't watch season 8, probably not going to watch this. You ruined everything that was good about GoT and maybe that's old George's fault. Probably why he's never going to finish the series. Wrote himself into SO MANY plot holes that the series ignores a good quarter of the plot and still falls on its stupid face. What happens to Catelyn Stark after she floats up downstream, reincarnated from the Red Wedding? What happens to Pod and Brienne when they're about to be hanged? I want to know GEORGE'S answer for these questions, not some shitty director.
Don't fail me again....Home Box Office.
They have proper written material. They don't have D&D. They have Ramin Djawadi. I think this has a decent chance!
Meh, I'm still not over how badly GoT season 8 was handled
Eagerly waiting for it, thanks HBO.❤️
0:42 She has Littlefingers Valyrian Dagger in her Hand (the one Arya uses to Kill the Night King)
Can a targaryen here have a happy ending at least? Gosh
Anxiety season is coming back in 2022 😝 HBO Max has pulled me back in 💸
HOOOOLLLLY SHIIIIITT. MY HEART❤  🐲 FIRE AND BLOOD
This gonna be epic 👍😻👍
Чёрный Таргариен конечно доставил. С ума посходили, и конца не видно 🤦‍♀️
The animators be sweatin' with bigger sizes and numbers of dragons flying all over the place and I salute them for bringing heavy fantasy to near real experience 🐲  And the wall, that frigging opening to the wall
Fool me once, shame on you.
good luck guys, i will 100% wait until the very end  before i decide if i watch or not
The intro music has me feelings all kinds of way 😍 Hoping it is as good as my expectations. Matt Smith as a Targaryen it's going to be legendary
I hope it’s close to the book storyline. It’s so dark and twisted at certain points. The fight scenes could be very entertaining to watch.
Looks nice (:
Whos the one thats narrating this teaser??
Anyone else think he looks like a White Walker?🤔
эпично!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please don't be trash please don't be trash please don't be trash please don't be trash
Yes! What a way to start the new year🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let me guess it will  start off really good, run out of source material then bs the ending
Where the dragons 🐉at!!
😍😍😍😍😍🥂🥂🥂🥂
In the second 0:41 you can see catspaw the Arya's dagger
No hope after they butchered story in last 3 seasons. How they butchered my boy Stannis.
Am freakin out braaa
I hope they don't spoil it like they did GOT last season
Goosebumps guaranteed ! When yow saw the throne in this teaser🔥🔥🔥
Love from india
WOW
You fuckin kidding me🥵🥵🥵🥵
It is looking good, just don’t “go woke” and know when to stop. Don’t f this up please, GOT wound is still bleeding. But I’m hopeful for this.
The rambunctious energy physiologically influence because daffodil karunagappally argue worth a upset save. obnoxious, imminent kidney
how canon is this shit? a black guy with blonde hair?
I’m still feeling sore from that horrible ending of GOT, not sure I’m ready to go through that again. 😢
Looks good but still hopeful for a Robert Baratheon war against the Targareyons or however u spell it
Fire
I am leveling expectations. This show is supposed to be based on stories from the Song of Ice and Fire and parts from Fire and Blood which provide the writers of this show with a loose outline and scattered moments at best. The writers have to be top notch to recreate the specifics of this story which definitely makes me cautious.
Couldn't give the last Season a proper ending so they decided to just make a Prequel...... Ok....... They shoulda just waited for George to finish the Book.
How is no one talking about how badass that throne looks now?
If GoT taught me anything; yeah...no thanks!
Oh no, they are not getting me again.
eu ja vi esse tease milhares de vezes e continuarei assistindo, essa serie vai ser sensacional, eu amo o mundo de George R. R.  Martin.
Please dont ruin this one.
Really excited 🔥🔥🔥
Black people, always the 3rd Wheel of Fantasy Television
They chose the least interesting major house (IMO) to do a series on. Hands down should have been the Starks or even the Lannisters. Hopefully the excellent cast will make it worthwhile.
After how GoT ended I have no  desire to watch this
WHY would I want to watch this knowing how it all ends!?  Fucking garbage
Почему им не отдали Ведьмака? 😭😭😭
Don't screw it up
If they don't fuck up the dialogue and won't dumb the plot down then this show will be one of the best
Looks awful
please stop with the s8 of GOT. this looks epic, we should appreciate it
Who's gonna be Aegon and Aemond one eye? Can't wait for Daemon vs Aemond!
Elly Space - Black Queen 💗💗💗
I haven’t seen any dragons… I’m disappointed 🤨
Pass.
Why should we care about this when we know how it eventually ends up? I loved game of thrones but once they ran out of book material it was just a downward slope that ended in the horrendous last series.
https://youtube.com/channel/UC_AZCwHjS-NqeRhZ5mSq-Uw
https://youtube.com/channel/UC_AZCwHjS-NqeRhZ5mSq-Uw
Me: I'm not watching this after GOT s8 Also me see's Matt Smith: fuck
I don't know if my heart is ready to trust again...
cant wait!!
Holy shittt.. I didnt expect the teaser come out this soon. But i love it
To EVERYONE MAD ABOUT A BLACK VALERIAN    These are FICTIONAL  CHARACTERS. GRRM approved all of the casting decisions.  So IF HES THE ONE WHO WROTE THE BOOK. How are you sitting here telling people there're should be no black Valerians? Have a SEAT and shut your racist behinds up.
Thanks but no thanks. There's so many other great shows and so little time. After being so dissapointed by the Game of Thrones finale I'm not giving my time and for sure not a HBO max subscription to them.
When you know how it ends so terribly what’s the point
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥can we just fast forward time!!!!!😱😭😭😭
Man that's really gonna be good for a while then turn into shit
Idk if I’ll watch I still have PTSD from how bad the last ending was
Damm i cant  wait for this
I would be extremely excited for this if they aint ruin game of thrones. Got was so raw tho so im sure itll be goodish
As long as D&D is not in any way involved in making this show then I'm in! Redeem yourselves HBO! We still remember how you butchered GOT's legacy!
Is this a movie or a show
im so sick of this bs. Why cant you just respect the original setting instead of transforming characters into other races. If the original setting of this character is white then whats the point of making him/her black or asian? I dont think its a good way to fight racism. Netflix has already ruined witcher with this crap and now HBO is going to ruin House of the Dragon.
Who are the writers of this? Not D&D right?
I can’t wait! The Targaryens dynasty is my favorite!! The Dragons, the females being warriors and riders, the madness. It is will always be the most fascinating portion of this world to me.
I don't care as long as they show Daenerys being resurrected at the end of this
So they retconned Velaryon Targaryen marriages?
رهيييييييييييييييب🔥
My request to HBO Max please this series dub in hindi
i wanna be hyped but the last season of GoT taught me to be carefull
Best part of GOT is dragons
Don't think I'll bother what's the point? Thrones crashed and burned worse than anything before it so why do I want the origins of a crap
MATT SMITH
Will the UK be getting HBO Max?
😴😴😴
I would love to see Jamie back for killing mad king in the end. Entry of Jamie will give such goosebumps.
House of the Africa
This gave me chills, hopefully it won’t disappoint
No thanks.
Meh after how they ended the first GoT I won’t be watching this.
INDIAN FAN ALSO WAIT FOR THIS EPIC PREQUEL OF THE GOT. PLEASE ASSURE US IT WILL BE ALSO RELEASE IN HINDI
I swear Graham McTavish is fantasy royalty at this point
Hard pass
This looks so good it gave me goosebumps and I watched the trailer 5 times cos I couldn’t be satisfied.
Afro - Targaryan 😱😱😄😄  Tolerant 2.0
The old wife sister in the background lol
Dope that The Doctor pretended to be a Targaryen for a while. As long as D&D aren't involved I'll watch this for sure.
Wish I cared
💙💙
Not even a bit excited. GOT hype already death for me. Don't see how they gonna bring people to watch.
Too many blonde people, looks weird.
Espero que matt smith al fin tenga su oportunidad de brillar
YOU SHOULD MAKE YOUR ALL PROJECT NOTE ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT ALSO IN HINDI.
Winter is coming again 😀😘❤️
I hope this is at least like season six and seven of Game of Thrones, not the last season.
I doubt it will be as good as GOT.
This better make up for season 8 😤.
0:38..
WoW 🔥🔥 waiting...
Letsss gooo
Hmm thats Cool..
yess!
HBO there better be some god damm good bard song in this.     And maybe some dragons but who knows
hopefully they actually make the valyrian steel swords look different. lets hope its not another dumb and dumber style game of thrones
We want Hindi dubbing
So good to hear daenerys theme again
I already speak dragon! Dracarys
Please also release it in Hindi ❤️
News for you the series suck Bc if the bad cast
I am Eagerly waiting for first look of any Dragon
Espero que en México también venga incluido en la plataforma de hbo máx.
after the complete waste of time that game of thrones tv show turned out to be combined with the fact that the writer of the books refuses to finish them i dont think its smart to invest anymore time in this universe
Uhhh. this is not a season 8 remake. BOOOO
Weidest doctor who crossover but i'll take it
are ALL comments gonna be about got s8??? just enjoy this new chapter and forget about that ending. this new content (and the creators) don't want or need your complains. just enjoy this
*Yaaaaawwwwnnn* So over this series. Season 8 killed my enthusiasm for all things GoT.
Not hyped. But hopefully HBO has changed their showrunner exclusivity clause and are willing to ditch them in case they, or any other showrunner, pulls a D&D
Games of the trones will back😁❤️
Can't wait to see how they completely muff the final seasons!
This is all I ever wanted...
മല്ലു പവർ കാണിക്കാതെ മക്കളെ🤩🤩
Really wish they don't end like a last season of game of thrones
Still trash. Season 8 ruined the entire franchise for me. Gonna give this a hard pass. Good luck to those who watch this. Hopefully it isn't ruined like season 8 of got was.
0:38 hahahahahahahhaahahahaha
"A targaryen , alone  in the world, such a terrible thing". Well, Aemon, gonna be so many here~
This show is going to surpass game of thrones in every possible way, they have a director and writer that actually cares about detail, they have a complete story, and they have a bigger budget. I can't wait for House of the Dragon!!
in the words of the legendary Jon Snow...  "I don't want it, I never have!"
Dear Lord,  Please don't let this be a botched show.  Amen 🙏
Ye piche ramsay ki awaj hai Kya ?
Favorite franchise until the last season. It literally ruined everything for me and left such a bad taste in my mouth that I don’t even care for this when I should
I really wanted a show about Aegon targaryan the first but this will do!
THIS WILL KICK FUCKING ASS
It's very tough to be excited for this.
Look at the Shot Composition and framing. you can see they took their time with it unlike the last few seasons of GOT
I m excited.
They destroyed the source material and disrespected the audience. Why watch?
It's a fan film ?
Ooohhhh my goodness....i am sooooo excited 😲😲😲😲😲
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Let the story be on one side.. But making wise GOT has set the benchmark.. HOD will also be a visual treat..
Somehow this does not look promising to me at all. Perhaps it's to do with the casting...but of course, we don't know much about the show yet.
The nightmares of GOT s8 still haunts me 🥺
Real talk. No one cares if “the last season of GOT” damaged you so much that you couldn’t watch this. You cared enough to watch this trailer and comment lol yall goofy asses will watch this too once you see everyone else talking about it
To me the dragons are the least interesting part of the series lol. I’m disappointed they didn’t choose one of literal dozens of potential time periods to work with
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
Will the lighting be good this time?
Don't know why but I'm not excited I wanted a good ending of GOT or maybe they should continue the story I don't want dragon queen dead
Please don't make the same mistakes the last seasons of your predecessor make.
Soo that's what the Doctor was doing in between seasons!
Crazy to think that 200 years ago is not that long in game of thrones time, the starks ruled as kings of winter for 8000 years so much content the writers can take from, I’ve got high hopes for this series and I hope we can eventually see a long night one so we can see house starks, and lannisters origins
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally a reason to keep moving forward
Pleas dubbing artist good hindi voice .
DRACARYS 🔥
Finally! The king of all series came back into the Game
A black Targarian...  "We wuz dragon riderz an sheeeet!"
I wanted  this actually happened in future!
God damn... It's really here, isn't it..
I've extremely high hopes with House of Dragons
Doctor Why?
YES YES YES !!! THE WAIT IS OVER.... SO HAPPY TO SEE TARGERYANS ANOTHER TIME 😎
oh my good im so excited this looks fantastic!!!
WE ARE READYYYYYY
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Game of Thrones' ending was terrible. I'm not wasting any more time on another show until George finishes his books. So probably never.
Beautiful
Dear sweet Jesus! This looks AMAZING
I'm afraid I'll start to watch this and then they'll fuck up the last season, like they did to GOT! 🤔🤔
Y’all still care?
I am wa8ing for
Is it going to start out good then end like it's written by 3rd graders?
How about we leave Westeros and explore Essos and surrounding areas a bit more. So much potential in those continents.
WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS?!?
I wish we could see Duncan the Tall, so sad...
Jesus is coming Jesus he loves you he came and died for our sins you can repent and accept him as your lord and savior  remember we are not going to live for ever  what are you going to say when you go befor him guys hell is real you don't want to spend youre eternity in hell burning and saying if only i would have accepted Jesus as my savior come to his arms he is waiting for you!!!! i love you in Jesus name i just want you to be saved God bless !!!
comments are so recent  wowww
The fashion in Westeros bruh. Static asf 😂
I want the epic theme music ..... 😬😬😬😬
If this hurts me the way GOT last season did I'll swear off of Westros forever!
i Wanted the *ROBERT'S REBELLION prequel ...But this seems nice as well!!
Let's gooooo!!!!!
i dont care what you make but put blaks in it
Fuck ya this what i was waiting for ❤️

"Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did." CHILLS
Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did
Moneyyy

Can anyone lemme knoww the full targareyn family and GOT and this HOUSE OF DRAGONS full family chart
No hype
yesssss!!
I hope to see orgin story like the ymirs in aot or far better. Good things can wait ❤️❌
Well I guess I can't deny its not happening anymore honestly I wanna be excited about it yet I dont think I'll ever get the bad taste of OG GOT out of my mouth what worse is when  you have a prequel to a show you already know the ending make its hard to get excited for
😍😍😍
If got went woke again I'm not watching for pay.
For the people worrying about will this be good or will it be repeat of the last season. Remember the reason why the last season was bad because they tried to make the story themselves and not follow the novel as long as they followed the novel GOT was perfect. But this time they already have the source material complete and they don't have to do much just convert novel into tv which they were already doing.
❤️❤️❤️
I'm not going to lie.  The end of Game of Thrones killed the excitement of this for me.  I know how it all ends.. no matter how much backstory they give us.. how cool the dragons are...  it all just  squeaks away.  I hope I'm wrong and this is good, I actually love Matt Smith, but who knows...
WINTER IS COMING STARK!!!!!! HURRRAAAHHH CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS DURING MY CHRISTMAS VACATIONS
"Fire is coming"
by ruining a series now you are telling me to watch the prequel! !  not excited at all 😑🙄
🔥😍😍😍
Good thing this series has a known ending not guesswork like game of thrones
dislike for black Targaryens
🔥&  🗡
🔥🔥
Ебать а что там Ларин делает
Wow, I don't care. Congrats to the diversity hire for getting a job.
I saw the black Targaryen but where are the Asian, Indian and Hispanic Targaryens you freaking racists!
Thank u 😢😢😀
Wow this is going to f*cking terrible. Way too late with this especially after you let Dan and Dave f*CK GOT into the dirt from season 5 and on.
Porqué le suben justo cuando Estoy en el colegio 😩
2 bad GOT seasons and everyone here thinks they’re a show runner now. Lol...
Who's gonna watch this after the horrible got finale? I just don't have any confidence on HBO
Dreams didn't make us Kings, Dragons did.  That's Powerful statement 💪🏻🙌🏼🤯
Let see how this goes.
Not gonna lie, production looks on point. But I'm too traumatized from GoT season 7+8 to be excited...
Hope it is nowhere as perfect as last 2 seasons of GOT...🤣
Aegon the Conqueror? The dance of the dragons? YES PLEASE!
Thankfully the history of the Targaryens and Westeros has been completely fleshed out by the prequel novels. So we shouldn't run into the problems that we ran into w/GOS S8. Nevertheless, I am so fucking hyped!!
They all died in the end, there I saved you 6 seasons
No mention of incest?
Hair looks super fake. Director fail
Zero point in this series ⚰️
I'm gonna watch this just to see Matt Smith leap from a dragon in the middle of the air and land on another
IF David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are somehow involved in this series I will simply skip it.
It’s going to be woke sheisse.
We don't need this just remake GOT season 8
So excited about this
Look at all this effort they should have put into season 8.
So excited😎😎
Hahahahahahahahhahaha. FAIL
The Dance of Dragons as brought to life in Rogues and Dangerous Women is probably my favorite story in the SoFAI history but everything ive seen and read about the series makes me want to run away as fast as I can. But the main thing I think will be it’s downfall is the fact that HBO really dumbs down it’s stories and plots (mainly cutting down the character count) for the sake of its audiences. They did this more times than I can count in GoT (and I didn’t watch anything past what is novelized, so season 5). This is an EXTREMELY COMPLEX story and it’s beauty and genius is in that complexity. I highly doubt they will be able to authentically recreate that for this series. I hope they can but I don’t see it going well
Hope they learned something from their mistakes.
I WANT to BELIEVE !
Aside from the last season not being long enough, I am happy with the ending. Danaerys' story line couldn't have ended any other way. Insanity is hereditary, especially with a good dose of incest thrown in. Bran was the perfect choice to sit on the throne. Anyone else would have been corrupted... even Jon.
YES
Spoiler : They all die
If this was a couple years ago I'd be shitting my pants in excitement. But after se8 I honestly can't even really bring myself to care
"200 YEARS BEFORE THE CRAPPY FINAL SEASON'"
The first time they say “Dracarys” I will be losing my mind
مبدئياً كدا حيغطي ع الثرونز يفندم
In pop culture, this could be the First "prequel saga" to be BETTER than the original!
I can't see the imp.
It feels weird by watching this trailer alone makes me feel sad all over again instead of being hype. But i'm being hopeful since Matt Smith is in it.
Listening to the them gets me goosebumps 😳😳
негров видимо волшебный огонь драконов черными сделал 😂😂😂
Looks boring😴
No books to base this on. I have very little hope for this.
So this is about the Dance! Interesting...
I GOT chills! < see what I did there? Ahahah 🥶😂
Damn, the Doctor looks badass >_<!
Isn’t this also based off an unfinished prequel series.
I’m debating whether or it’ll be worth it. Season 8 ruined the whole franchise and now we’re getting a sequel even tho everyone wanted to redo it, idk just feels like the ultimate middle finger
ABO! 100%!
imagine if danny was saved by lord of fire and then there was a sequel
Pro: we get to see The Dance of the Dragons. If you think Daenerys was cruel, just wait and see what Rhaenyra Targaryen does.  Con: I don't get to see in live action the Aerea Targaryen event. She's the reason why travelling to the ruins of Valyria was banned in Westeros.
Will never watch this rubbish after the way HBO destroyed game of thrones

“I've got a fever and the only prescription is more dragons!!!
ofc no dragons in this video....cause THATS JUST WHAT THEY DO
Getting a tiny bit hyped... Don't fuck this one up to the point of obscurity like you did last time.
meh....was hoping this will be time of Liliana Stark and the Prince....not interested in this at all...sad
You get a dragon! You get a dragon! You get a dragon! Everybody gets a dragon!!!
Why couldn't they do Robert rebellion prequel Idgaf about this
Well now I have a reason to go and get hbo max
It feels so good to see the GoT logo again <3
If there won’t be good showed massacre and plot, i’d probably skip it (final season still haunts me)
Love from india
lol, this looks like shit.
It's unimaginable for me to be standing in 2021 refusing to ever consume any GoT content ever again after what D&D did to the series but here we are.
Well at least they dont have to say "winter is coming" a bajillion times.
🤩
Matt Smith!!!
Don't care
IT WILL SUCK ….IM OUT…NICE TRY HBO…..NEVER FORGET..
This won't be like a game of thrones because we actually have an ending we know what happened. A Game of Thrones show was for ppl most likely didn't read the books because they changed alot of the story lines & they cut some characters out as well combining some characters like how they cut out Jon Connington & gave Jorah Mormont Jon Connington Grey scale. Edrick Storm out but Gendry has some of that story line. But House of Dragon is for us book readers. Side note I have watch this damn trailer like 50 times today
I’m always down to see some inbred Targaryens get wiped - looking forward to this!

HBO Max :  Knock Knock Me: hold the door, hold the door, hold the  door. Hordor. After the last season I'm very suspect...
Evde mallus show some powers💖💖💖   Katta waiting for this🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don't trust them anymore
God, this looks disgusting
Can't just stop watching GoT after all the 8 season Now iam waiting for another epic series
*starts squealing*
Looking forward to watching and maybe I can finally forget about that atrocious last season of Game of Thrones.
Velaryon casting is trash
❤️
Sickkkk
Nice the music melody still has the spirit
Tangeenaaa!!!!
dragons tiz nutz
GoT season 8 really destroy this franchise
not by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss? thats good, or not?
The echoes of the original theme of GOT gives me the chills.
Very high expectations.
Can't wait to spend 7 years loving this series and then getting let down again in the final season!
And so the milking begins.
Not looking forward to this show. But after how they butchered season 8 of GOT... I just can’t. That show was on course to becoming one of the greatest show in human history in my opinion. Like an emotional scar. You grew up with these characters and they desecrated their storylines and plot.
Hope there's a coffee cup in it, that's my favourite part ! 🤩🤩🤩🙏🙏
The swords strewn around the Iron Throne look like a blend between the book/show throne.
This trailer shows so much promise. I AM _IN!!!_ And did you see the throne?!!?
Don't Finish It Like GOT !
LET'S GOOOO, PLEASE BE GOOD
Realease it in india "your platform"🙏❤️
Anyone else thinks they look too clean? Like got characters look dirty and real...these look super clean and ironed out...im just nit picking
Instead of this please give us revised last season. You owe it to is.
I still haven’t forgiven the last season
❤️❤️❤️
I want to be excited but screw you HBO for ruining the greatest show of all time
Matt Smith!!!
I hope its better than last season og GOT, I couldn't even finish it such a let down
i dont like prequels as its already happened and its not something readers should be excited about as we all know the characters we are rooting for will be gone  , as we already know what happens to targayreyan house !!!   HBO should have given us something like a sequel of GOT S8 as to what happened to jon and the dragon ?? did jon ultimately established targareyon house or not  ??  but instead  HBO gave us a boring prequel !!!
I really want to be excited but the final season of Game of Thrones really hurt this franchise. I'll be watching this with apprehension. I hope it turns out great!
Summa thee💥💥💥
Me still waiting for a Robert Rebellion spin-off series:
actors look cheap
Daenerys Blaeckborn
belissimo vídeo
...meh
I am from India
@Rawrist I’m assuming you’ve seen this already! I can’t wait to hear your thoughts!
Who gives a shit about this. Every true man of culture craves for BARATHEONS' STORY.
❤️❤️❤️
I said I wasn’t going to watch this but I think I’m going to watch it.
Black Targaryen with white dreadlocks 😂😂😂 oh please. They had to find a way to wokeify this somehow
Finally it is here
Hoping everything about this series isn't rushed just like the last season of Game of Thrones because wtf man
WE
It's important to remember that D & D HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS SO IT'LL ACTUALLY BE GOOD.
Matt Smith gonna carry this series
Matt Smith is a freakin' beast.  They nailed that role, that's for sure.
Dreams didn't make us king Brann: am I a joke to you 😤👀
I no longer care
Looks nice, let's see if the ending of this show is going to be better than the last one
where dragons come on
Yeah we'll see, we'll see, won't be paying a dime to watch this. Especially after the last season of GoT..... and with it being the age of woke.... we'll see...
I better now see doctor who's nuts in this show , it will spoil my good memories of Matt Smith , just like they were spoiled when I saw Christopher ecelesons flapping in my face in the leftovers
Yup
Espero no arruinen esto
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ok, excuseme but WTF is that black doing in there... Valyrians aren't supposed to look like that. Jeez...
Prediction:  They will make half the cast gay, and be sure to point that out at every turn as if its relevant to the story or palatable to the audience.
cool, but my nitpicky ass is a bit disappointed that a four legged dragon is STILL being used as the Targaryen crest instead of a lore friendly two-wings-two legs variant.
I can't wait to see it I just hope it doesn't recon everything the first show did
Yow tamil la viduga ya. Need tamil language please 😭❤️❤️
Will the serie be f*cked up on its end as GoT was? You guys made me hate Game of Thrones because of the last 2 seasons.
Increíble!! Feliz de poder tener un pedacito de Game of Thrones otra  vez!! ❤️🐲❤️
this looks sooo goooddd
Long live House Targaryen.
Why are there black tho?
Sambavom 🔥🔥🔥
That trailer didn't too much to enthrall me, it could have been any generic fantasy movie slip
I literally spent an hour yesterday contemplating if I should get into the show or books knowing one ends bad and the other might never end...
Вваааааау
FIRE AND BLOOD!!!!!
The throne looks amazing and I'm so happy Ramin Djawadi is back. I can't wait for this era to begin.
foi muito rapido. proximo de no minimo 5 min por favor
Just came here to say I'm not watching this even if it's good.
Eh
- i hope they take it easy on incest complex this time !! - Targaryens:  DRACARYS muthafcka...
If Ramin is coming back for the music, I'll give the show a chance. Point blank period.  - Yes the actors are fantastic, the VFX, cinematography looks dare I say BETTER than anything on GoT - An actual Iron Throne made up of swords from Aegon's conquest..... There are reasons to be very excited, but I'm sorry till this day, I know it wasn't HBO's fault (it was dumb and dumber) but anything with GoT attached to it leading forward I worry.
تكفون بسرعه
i think i speak for all game of thrones fans when i say, please redo the final season of game of thrones.  i would normally be very excited for this until that final season left such a bad taste in my mouth. absolutely ruined a damn good show. so my excitment for this is greatly deminished as a result.
"an HBO original" lol
I haven't watched the original much, but I hope this gets popular. The normies need some exposure to grim fantasy/medieval stuff or else they'll get completely consumed by rap and  capeshyt. The Witcher is already getting a bit old and nothing has replaced it in pop culture yet.
That looks class 👌
Please be safe to watch with family (I don't mean children), please be safe to watch with family...
*Tardis sounds*      What? DW fans were also betrayed by the last season! We are basically blood brothers.
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Jon Snow was revealed to be Aegon Targaryen, blood of fire and ice, and that amounted to ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
Remake season 8
Black Targaryen? Are you joking?
Not gonna lie, after the train wreck of the GoT HBO series ending , I don’t want to watch this and not even interested…. The Ending ruined it for me
They better be wearing purple contact lenses!!
book accurate iron throne looks so amazing
Where the fuck are the dragons 🐉
Not more of this poop 🤬🤬🤬
Please dub in hindi
Let's see how they manage to ruin this one
I want nothing but dragons, like all dragons all the time. Dragons eating, fighting, shitting, fucking, flying, dropping huge dragon shits all over Westeros. Dragons, dragons, dragons!
The rebirth of a franchise.. And it will be, spectacular.  Cant wait
Absolutely love that the iron throne looks more like Martin’s vision, so badass!, cannot wait.
Sounds exciting... still... season 8 left a horrible taste in my mouth that I cant help but try my best that everything seaons 6/7+ is not canon to make this show more enjoyable.
At least cinematography looks nice, I'll give the that.
Sadly this will probably be woke af and they're going to change so many things to avoid angering the PC babies.
i absolutely love the new and more accurate throne,looks majestic,just like in the books
Miss the universe so much Ramin music is carrying
Looks terrible, one of the shots is under exposed and there is nothing exciting or gripping about this. I look forward to not watching this.
I wanna see Balerion the dread 😱
GOT vibes !
മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ
Hope they learned their lesson with the last seasons of GOT. it will probably be of the quality of season 6. Stunning production, decent writing, but lacking the genius of George to carry it.
Fake
i hope they readed the books
It’s so cool
I’m not going to watch another GoT series just so you can poop out the last season on my chest. Fuck off with this shit.
Is dumb and dumber out of the production here?  Want to know before committing my time to it.
Dear HBO,  Please don't fuck this up! Regards, GOT S8 survivors
42 seconds in , am I tripping or is that the valyrian steel dagger that Ayra killed the Night King with ?
I'm waiting for all the episodes to be released and then marathon it. Hard to get excited for this after the final GOT season.
please recreate got season 8 and also look for hbo in india
Nope. Not sitting through years of this again just to be disappointed. Maybe when the series is finished.
Before you get too attached to the "House of the Dragon" show, remember that by the time you get to "Game of Thrones" there are only two Targaryens left and zero dragons. So steel your heart my friends. #GOTSeason8Trauma
Ngl looks pretty good, but It’s gonna have to be a masterpiece in order to redeem that god awful last season of Game Of Thrones
Oh right, I forgot this IP existed.. That's how bad you botched the end of GoT  This entire universe is dead to me
0:18 Balerion????!!!
🙃waiting for this....
I still wish the last seasons of GOT was different… not teleporting, character arc failing, easy killing Night King, one-dimensional characters, rushed, dark picture viewing rush of a last season.
I really hope this doesn’t turn into a wokefest with loads of black people, just makes it (lol I get we’re talking about dragons here) unrealistic.
My anticipation for this is weighted a little by the knowledge that people will take it as an opportunity to whine more about how game of thrones ended.
Waiting ❤
As much as GoT fans are looking forward to this show,  it's the upcoming 'Bran the Broken' series that's got everyone _really_ excited.
I'm absolutely, 200% fine with making the cast more diverse than in the books. But they better not make the show ABOUT race, seriously. Already you can tell that they are putting a lot of emphasis on the diverse characters in this trailer even though only one is supposed to be important (Corlys Velaryon played by Steve Toussaint)... Please don't make that mistake, HBO. Make the casting as diverse as you want but let the story about the story.
I got really excited at first,but then i remembered the last GoT season
Ooohh yes . I’m so excited for this.😎🤩
I see Matt Smith, I click.
Ill watch this thinking that season 8 of GOT didn't happened at all
Game of thrones already lost me. This show is nothing but a shameless-money-grab. If HBO cared about GOT fans or the quality of their content, they wouldn’t have let the rushed mess that is Season 7 or 8 happen.  Sorry, not investing time and energy again on a story that greedy directors and producers will just ruin in the end.
Holy shit yes
I got a chub seeing this
Am I the only one getting Mortal Kombat vibes from that flaming dragon emblem?
GOT was ruined HBO you can't have my $. Fool me once!!!!
Жду с нетерпением
Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did 🔥🔥
If somebody isn't naked episode 1, then I'm out.
I’m just glad we are able to see there are POC in this series. But what about the Lgbtq+ community? I hope the next preview focuses on that.
House Velaryon😍
Ramin Djawadi never lose his originality of music hats off to the legend i watched game of thrones because of the soundtracks

WOWWWWWWW!! Honestly, i rather this prequel than a continuation to GOT. I hope the actors give just as amazing performances as the cast of GOT
Nah, I'm good.
And so the hype begins...
Just so you know, the showrunner is a GoT book addict and has buy in from Martin. This will be done right.
hindi dubbed available? ??
The voice over sounds just like Ramses
I'm back in
Is it here yet?
This gonna be epic
https://youtube.com/channel/UC_hwyt4xxj2v1ZtI5WEBouQ
is that Game of thrones season 9 ?
Everyone looks like the Witcher nowadays
Sounds like Ramsay Bolton
Cannot wait. Just cannot.
I hope to see some Starks
GRRM had nothing to do with season 7 or 8 of GOT. That's why they sucked. Will this be GRRM? Or the talentless hacks, Benioff and Weiss?
anyone notice the CATSPAW DAGGER queen alicent is holding
Dracarys
https://youtube.com/channel/UC_UXT2Id2o0v-LaUTQSraVw
I'd rather watch a series on arya's adventures. There's no way this will be as good as GOT.
Oh snap !
Give me game of thrones.... But make it.... Even whiter! 😂
DIOOOOOOOOS, MODO TIESA
Only 200 years before? So no dragons no aegon? Disappointing
After see what you did with the end of GoT, this shit will have 0 chances.
La fotografia se parece mas a series como The witcher :( , yo que amo la fotografia de GoT especialmente la de la 6ta temporada
HOUSE   OF   THE       🐉       2022      POR     HBO MAX
MATT SMITH??? OMFG
HBO puts trailer to new show ( last hope after lots of fuck ups ) in 1080p with heavy compression .. lol
Hope two things.  Targaryan become what they are suppose to be... crazy-incest-bat shit-racist.  They kill all of the black people from House Manning, to explain why they are not there in the futur and by the end of the serie.... we hate them more than we hated the Lannister.
Let's goooo!!
Black targarien))
why start watching when you know theyre going to ruin the whole show in the last season
PA-RA-SHA!
December 2022?
YES! Yes! YES! 🙆
I cant Wait ..........
I hope to God D&D are not the writers this time.
Let's hope and this if R. R Martin finishes writing it and does not lazy like Game of Thrones
The problem with this prequel is the knowledge that Daenerys will kind of forget about the Iron Fleet and Euron's forces 200 years later. It can not be erased.
HBO executives” Dragons” show creators” yes”.  “ we need about 5 million plus incentives for the cast & workers per show”. HBO executives” Dragons…..Yes”.🤣🙏🏾
Ramin's music is amazing!!!!
I like the dragons did part
This new season of Doctor Who is going a pretty weird direction
After watching how rush the season 8 GOT, I afraid to watch this
disappointment
They same guy who wrote the ending of GOT wrote this too, looks fucking terrible. 😞
I love Matt Smith and I´m not afraid to say it. Also, is Djawadi doing the music? I hope so.
Is D&D writing this prequel??
How to fix game of thrones?   Just change name of Succession to Game of Thrones. 🤣
cheeky nod to dany in the music at the end, okay you got my attention, now don't f*ck this up pleaseeee
Did the same people cast the characters? So far the only one I am excited for is Emma. For some reason most if this didn't feel right to me. Which was weird because I really love a lot of those actors in other stuff. Can't wait for it to start already.
Throne looks more accurate
I can't wait
Let's goooo
0:38 fetch the Oscar , golden globe and Emmy immediately , we have tolerant Valyrians . And why Targaryen woman that scary here , in books they always was beautiful , Visenya and Rhaenys especially.
Who cares the show made this all pointless and meaningless idc about starks or Targaryens in the end it didn't matter
😭😭 I'm so happy. 😭😭
How can you guys be hyped for this after the shit show of the final season?
Been waiting for the trailer so long, finally it's out. Looks promising, can't wait to see it! 🐉🔥
FIRE WILL REIGN CANT WAIT
I hope germany will get soon HBO Max!
Going to hard pass for now. Still not getting the throne right which points to not actually caring about the IP or staying true to it which was the downfall of the show, the more they moved away from the books the worse the quality got.
Can't wait to see Balerion in action🖤💥
Is this still going to be written and directed by Dumb and Dumber?
Why would anyone watch this after the last season of got? Anyone who does watch this on hbo is a fool
Holy fuking shit! Hell yeeees
Well luckily for HBO “Blood & Fire” is already a finished book and I think they learned their lesson about straying from the writers material with GoT. I’m excited to watch!
We don't care we hate you for what you did in S8, go to hell
Oh, again the doctor was reborn into the wrong person =(
Eagerly Waiting for prequel..😍🤩
I really want to be excited but the final season of Game of Thrones really hurt this franchise. I'll be watching this with apprehension. I hope it turns out great!
LMAOOOO You really think I'm going to waste another 8 years of my life on this shit?
WE FUKING WAITING !
Finally teaser
Looks like repackaged wannabe GOT crap.
People actually give a crap? weird
I can't cope. Omg come on 2022. So so excited 😃😃😃
2022 ya quiero que llegues lo más pronto posible..!! * 🌠🔥🔥🔥
Vem muito aí
Will we see Aegons conquest?
I guess this is a Max original rather than a HBO original.
This is the Dance of Dragons ins't it?
From the writer of rampage and hercules - nothing to see here lads just a cash grab
Knowing how season 8 ended, dont really care about anything related to game of thrones anymore
Try not to let morons ruin it this time
Who's the actress at 0:40?
Nah.
Going to take a wait and see on this one. The last 3 seasons of GoT really turned me off as its clear that those in charge of it could not write on their own and needed source material...and no amount of trailers is going to turn me back on. Though at least they tried a little harder with the throne, but are still way off which only raises my fears of yet another series that will not hold true to the material.
Everyone should give this a chance. This is based off a story that is already written and finished, so they HAD to have learned their lesson after the last few season of GOT.  Keep an open mind!

Who are the script writers? I want to know that first.
How am I supposed to watch this in India
I'm still processing the trauma and grief of season 7/8 but I'll watch this and hope for good television.

Is that Ramsey?

Look at the black excellence 🔥🔥
I came
Well hope they don't mess this one up.
Me muero 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not gonna lie, a few years ago I would have been hyped for this show and now all I feel is apprehension 🤣 I'll probably give it a go when it's got a couple of seasons on air, if it manages that.
I just hope we get to see a lot of oppai.
I never forgot the crap last season of Got and so I can't get my hopes up anymore in these spinoff series
Make a sequel to Game of Thrones
Could have atleast given a peak of Vhagar

This trailer was so good!! As a huge fan of Game of Thrones I’m excited for this since the announcement
Looks like GOT season 8 + Woke
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Clegane?
*confused happy Tardis noises*
it looks like they all are competing in a Legolas cosplay game.
Finally I can watch GOT again.. .. final season was so bad that I didn't even looked at it again . 😂
More Dragons!! This will be epic!!
Their first trailer is House of Dragon ! what's next to beat that . Can't wait for more
"HBO" the powerful names comes from powerful people
Alright, fine! I'll watch.  But I'm watching for Matt Smith. And Matt Smith alone!
THEY *kinda* FIXED THE IRON THRONE
LET'S GO!
So excited to the Targaryen’s in the height of their power ✨🔥 so anticipated for this
FIRE & BLOOD!
Of course they need to put as much black people there as possible
@HBO Max did you record this with your phone?
I swear to God, if Corlys Velyeron is black....... I will boycott this show. Even though I am excited for it
I think I was born to watch this show❤️❤️
It's gonna suck.
Weird. When I watch this I have this really bad taste in my mouth...
Start the damn show before I piss myself                        - Bobby B.
Adult Alicent is very young.  Too young to be a mother of married children who already have children of their own.  Even though her children, as well as Alicent herself, got married early seems pretty silly.
I'M SO EXCITED
Okay now we can start waiting for your vein writers to fuck this up.
corlys velaryon...... just fuckin up the show, before it even starts lol
Yo wtf is this dude is this some continuation???
You guys will find a way to screw this up too. Not falling for it.
"Hello, I'm the Dragon, basically.....run"
حمااااااااااااس 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bunch of simps in these comments
Goosebumps Alll over
ВАУ, ЖДЕМ СРОЧНО!
If Ramin Djawadi isnt back, I’m rioting!
Do you know what is the best thing about this show?  D&D aren’t involved in any way.
OH HOW I MISS THE WORLD OF WESTEROS!!
No dragons on the trailer. WTF?
Essa porra desse aplicativo da HBO vive dando bug crlh, tem que arrumar essa merda
Wait, is that the same white horse from that Season 8 episode?! I think it is!
AAAAAAAAHHH No la caguen por favooooorr
Why do I not even care now?
After watching season 8 of Game of Thrones, I wasn't willing to watch the prequel but after watching this, damnnn... There's no way I'm missing it!
I'm watching this for Matt Smith, and also for the hope that this series will be as good as Game of Thrones used to be before the ending.
Please make a video game on GOT 😇
“Dreams didn’t make us kings, Dragons did”  after watching how Dany went from a meek and timid doormat who was reprehensibly treated like dirt by her blatantly cruel, abusive, and domineering tyrant of a brother to a strong, dominating, and merciless woman who becomes powerful enough to be a queen so unbelievably quick after her dragons were born that was undeniably a fact
Was the Finale of Game of Thrones really that Bad? I haven’t seen Game of Thrones yet...
Waiting 💥💥
Yessssssssddsssdsdssdssssss
The true Iron Throne. Master of war is the leitmotiv of this teaser.
മലയാളികൾ ഇവിടെ കമോൺ 😍
Please don't screw up.
Meh.
Short, but hella sweet and man am I extremely excited for this!
Gods, kings, garbage...
I'm pretty sure that Matt Smith will steel the show!!!!
Honestly who gives a shit anymore? We all know all these people die and their heirs are dumbass’s that also die…. In a very rushed season.
Please dont let Dan and Dave anywhere near this.
The biggest twist they could write would be putting DnD back in charge and having it be shit.
Im gonna watch regardless..but  this feels weird
Fuck Yea here we go again. (just don't Fuck the ending up on this one)
Please dont fuck up the ending HBO, please please please
Why targaryen's dragon flag has four legs?
"each episode will be like a movie" - douche and douchier
Please just don't rush this like you did the last 2 seasons of GoT. If some asshole showrunners want to leave because they think they're going to work on a new Star Wars, let their asses go instead of letting them torpedo the show.
Malayalis ondooo😻💌 like.. Adii ondakil... 📍
HBO please India release date of Max please
This looks bad but you better believe I'm gonna watch it and be excited for it every damn week lol

Can't wait to see if any Tyrion ancestors available?

"The lone wolf dies but the pack survives."
Just when I thought I was out, HBO pulled me back in
I wonder what Alt Shift X has to say about this 🤔
Season 8 met with some critical acclaim it's easy to see why they decided to do this  Who am I kidding I'm still watching it
I need to book gorge . What’s a back story without an ending . Fire and blood was a cool book but come on man we need you to finish your story and not help hbo make a half ass ending .
Not expecting too much after s8 trainwreck
Put that shit on me. NOW!
I NEED IT    ...just keep the two guys' hands off of it
Se o final for lixo vsfd HBO
did anyone noticed the Catspaw Dagger in 0:41?
Was ist eine Blondine zwischen zwei AfD-Wählern?  Nicht die dümmste.
Not looking forward to peoples misconceptions about targaryens to carry over from the last season of GoT
That's Velaryon family? Have to be a joke haha. Stop ruinning all please.
Это негроТаргариен? Лолшто?
Who is gonna play aemond?
If they do this right, it should be an anthology that covers 200 years of history with a dedicated story arc and different cast for each era. Starting with the Doom of Valeria and the rise of House Targeryan in season 1, Aegon's conquest for season 2 and 3, Dance of Dragons for season 3 and 4, and end with Robert's Rebellion for season 5.
Finally 🐉
Dammit now I gotta sign back up with hbo
House of wokes. White wigs dreadlocks.
What? Game of thrones? Didn't everybody with algorithm hate it on 2019? Boring I rather watch the final season of better call Saul.
And JUST like that HBOMAX will be streaming KING!!!!! 18 BILLION will be spent on CONTENT next year!!!! Disney+ Shiddddddddd
WAYMENT! Was that a shot of the Mad King grabbing the sword @ 0:24 or am I just drunk w/ excitement rn?!??!?!?!
Can't wait for it🙌🙌🙌🙌❤👊💪
Winter is coming 🐉🐉🐲🐲🐲🌨️🌨️
Why is Dr.Who in this episode?
black Targaryan ? No offence but imma pass
I’m so excited 🥳🥳🥳
We miss u GOT 🥺❤
Nop
Every time a new Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land...that madness and greatness are on sides of the same coin.
Ramsay Snow Bolton ......perfect voice of fear...
Doctor who?
Instead of a prequel, couldn’t you have just remade and given us a real ending !?
Dragons are coming back!!! 😈
Hopefully there's just as much violence, cursing, and nudity as early game of thrones.
Game of thrones babackground ground music 😍😍😍
Черные Таргариены HBO вы серьезно?? 🤣🤣🤣 ахахахахах
House of the Wolf would have drawn me much more.
Almost over ten years since GOT premiere.
As long as it isn't directed by D & D I'll watch it.
You should have added this in the teaser ----- "Not By Dumb and Dumber" , just to clarify, you know........
THAT IRON THRONE THOUGH
oof one black actor
Really looking forward to this!   In spite of how absolutely  garbage seasons 7 and 8 were and how not great seasons 5 and 6 weren't great (ok they were good but how the fuck can you call Stannis' fate, the destruction of Theon's, Alisser's and Ramsay's plotlines, the entirety of Mereen good)
show me the dragons please 🥺
❤
GOT set to disappoint yet another generation of invested fans.
Dreams didn't make us Kings.... Dragons did
At least the ending won't be disappointing if they follow the book 😪😪😪
Black Targariens?????? Are you f*** kidding me???? This tolerance game gone so far!!!!
If GOT got terrible after season 5 due to bad writing then what do you expect from something that also has nothing to back it up! Still wanna see Dragons reign
🖤
Iam addiction GOT
The iron throne looks so cool
My man Lord Flea Bottom.
Iam waiting😍
i'm 14 how can i convince my parents i really want to watch this but first the first one but they wont let me because its to violent my friends have watched it
I'm not thrilled with the choice of actors, but never mind🙄 can't wait to watch this
I wonder if this will salvage the the fandom... cause it looks meh
Just keep D&D the hell away from it. Hopefully they kinda forgot about this series too.
WE
As long as D&D is nowhere in sight.
How many of u are sad after hearing that s6 was the last season of GOT, further seasons of it will not come in future!!!??And we will have to wait for the upcoming books to know what will happen after s6 ! 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂  Till then let's see how this prequel of GOT goes🙂 (btw it's looking great, teaser already has me hyped for the series)
one thing to say, dont fuk up the end
Plz hindi dubbed 😣
Who else thinks that voice sounds like “Niklaus Michaelson”

Les goooooooooooooooooooo
I'm trying not to get excited. I'm still hurt over season 8. They really did just tank their own production. At least they are no where near this one.
I’ll forever love Daenerys
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Eagerly awaiting
Очередную шляпу сняли, понятно
Looks like shit.
😭
OMG SHE LOOKED LIKE HUNTER SCHAFER???!!!
Am I the only one who feels the voice belongs to ramsey?
Let’s fuckin get it!
I just hope this isn't rush in any way like the horrible last season of GoT...
LFGGGGGGGGGG
Продолжение 😀
And now it starts all over again…
Please don't woke this shit
Matt Smith!  Hell yeah!
REMAKE SEASONS 7 & 8!!!
When is hbomax coming to India ?
OMG. I’ve been waiting for this. Watching Matt Smith is a cherry on top of the cake.
I’ll admit that the trailer looks good. Even though Dumb & Dumber are not involved in this show and it is separate from the Song of Ice & Fire, I don’t care anymore of anything related to Game of Thrones due to how it ended. There’s no point since it is known how it is going to end. Thanks for uploading.
Let’s go ! 😭
Work a good ending for Daenerys 😪😒😴😴😴 Make more money with the Targaryens 😍😍😍🥰😘
is that lannister logo ? at 0:43
the greatest teaser aver made
Anything GOT got killed for me after the final episode  Edit: whole of the final season
Que maravilhaaaaaaa!!!!!
George RR Martin is in on it so I hope it be a well deserved apology for the abomination you made out of GOT
🔥
maybe this wont be shit like game of thrones ended up being
Dear HBO:      please don’t fuck this up 🙏
omg! This is really happening. Right
Yawn.  Cookie cutter, unimaginative stupidity.  So, it ought to do very well with the kind of people who like this drivel. Another theme park ride.
i'll wait for the series finale and see if its worth it.
Could they not have found someone else? we don't want dr who
" But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God"   Romans 2:5 Jesus Christ is returning soon! Please Repent and believe to be saved! God Bless you all.
It's all great stuff, of course, but why is there a bunch of black people in terrible wigs?
Can’t wait for the game of thrones prequel series
hopefully they follow through the dance with dragonsand make no changes
Is it RAMSAY BOLTON'S voice?
/Try not to FUCK IT UP this time/
മലയാളി മച്ചാന്മാർ ഉണ്ടോ 🤩
Oh this teaser is making me sick Color palette is looking much like witcher  And that Iron throne man
Looks so much better than GOT.
So is this going to start of really good and then suck in the end too?
After watching the fate of GOT in last season. I really don't have the patience for this shit. 8 years down the drain....
Genuine questioned, is there a lot of sex scenes in the original source material for *House of The Dragon* or were the majority of the sex scenes in *Game of Thrones* were there just for the sake of it?
this look cheap as hell
Holy shit I was just watching a bunch of leaked set shit last night.. Fucking perfect timing lmao
OMG 😱😱😱😱 I LOVE IT🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
4 legged dragon? I thought they already said they were going to fix this? Other then that this is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 nice to see catspaw aswell with alicent😊😊
💥😍
Game of Throne का next है क्या
🤩🐉 can’t wait!!
I’m excited for it because it looks like there might be dragons in it! Dragons of the firey kind!
Now, amazon show us teaser of lotr series.
Good to see House Valeryon :D
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't let me down HBO
😍 looks great
Oh hell yeah!!!!
House of Dragon trailer without any fucking dragons.. Are you kidding me ?
But who has a better story than bran the broken?
I'm excited for this show to build up stuff that will have little to no payoff like its predecessor. Fun stuff.
the whole world is waiting
Alright I'll be the one to say it. Matt Smith looks dumb as f**k! Bad casting here.👎
Inclusion forzada
Let's GO!!!🙌🏽
Young Geralt from witcher and king Ezekiel from walking dead are going to meet each other lmao
I just love the fact that Daemon Targaryen and Rhaenyra Targaryen are the ancestors of Maester Aemon, Daenerys, Rhaegar, Viserys, Robert, Stannis, Renly, Gendry and Jon.
Doctor, what are you doing here? Get back inside the TARDIS
Honestly looks like a cheap walmart version of GoT. Hope im wrong.
I adore Fire&Blood the book, even the ugliest wig can't stop me from watching this.
FIRE IS COMING
Just be good.
YAAAAAAAAASSSS
Matt smith.....ResidentSleeper
Awesome 😎
Meh.....
aaaaahhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhh aaaaaaaa 😍😌
Just don’t butcher your own work this time
But I want GOT to be continued from where it had stopped So many unanswered questions there
Aquele momento que você fica ansioso pra ver o teaser e não consegue nem dar play
Don't care, where is winds of winter
Assuming there will be a lot of creepy sorcery since isn’t this the time where it was way more common and potent ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
VAMOOO LA CONCHA DE LA LORA
This looks cool really excited for HOD
I hope this series will have more logic and Daemon will not fly with the dragon into an army of artillery by himself.
It's just 🔥
I'm waiting for first season ⚡
If you're still complaining about S8, PLEASE GET A LIFE!!!
Thank god DnD are nowhere to be seen
Don't fuck this one up
The trailer for season 8 looks good
Meh.
Dr. DRAGON
Valar morghuils
Nambre, se ve que va a estar bieen mamalona
When will we get hbo max in India? Please don't neglect us . Waiting to see these movies for a long time .Now getting impatient.
Summa thee👀
Meh! HBO shot themselves in the foot with season 8, basically destroyed the series and any excitement for prequels. They should have listened to the fans and reshoot season 7 and 8 or better still extend the story to 9 or 10
Is this really real? Like please don’t play with my feelings like that 😭😭
I rolled my eyes at the thumbnail, but after watching I'm actually pretty hyped  That armour looked dope.
The trailer looks hot, not as hot as Rhaenyra before the Hour of the wolf but still
I am immensely intrigued by matt Smith's character
Cant wait
Holy shit, they’re finally depicting the iron throne as it should be!
OMG 😳❤️❤️ I'm eager to watch it.... Finally something related to game of thrones... I always wanted something complexes series to game of thrones 💯❤️
There's alot of good material for this. Should be great.
Finally.....It's here😊❤
Can we fast-forward faster to 2022 😁😁😁😁
Are all Targaryan women looks like a dwarfs???
GERONIMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The fall of throne  ??!!
Pero bueno .... 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲😳😳😳😳😻😻😻😻😻😻😻🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Ansioso pra assistir, vai ser muito bom
YESSSSSSSS!!!!! I'm definitely ready to see some dragons again.
About time! I'm excited!!
What is Matt Smith doing in here
When the story itself has been written and has an end the writers will have no "we didn't have a roadmap" excuse, so that alone has me optimistic. Plus it's a cool story that abandons a lot of the stuff that just dragged GOT down in the end.
It could be great. Could be terrible. I’ll check it out but I doubt I can ever get invested in it. We already know the ending and…well, it was Season 8
Shouldnt it be “a” hbo original series not “an”
Terrible cast. He was the worst Doctor Who and now he'll be the worst Targaryan.
The iron throne looks so much better than in the first show
This Targaryen Era had White walkers ?
I'm excited for Cregan Stark and the Hour of the Wolf. Most badass Stark for me, 2nd only to Theon the Hungry Wolf.
The Iron Throne looks rad. Finally.
Cat's Paw at 0:41
This better be good ! Season 8 memories are fresh still
Me arrepiei toda 😳❤️
Gods, Kings, FIRE and BLOOD!!!  Ok count me in..
Looking forward to this. The storylines of the House of the Dragons are rich, so are all the other houses in GoT, particularly the Starks, defender of the North and its long history with The Wall, that is rich in traditions and heroes.
OMGGG!!!!😭😭😭
This is beautiful. I have been looking at it for 5 hours now.
Have you seen the TARDIS in the throne rooms right corner? And i think the Doctor can change the outcome of Season 8.
I really hope they dont fuk this one up as well
It's probably going to be awful, but hey, I'll watch it
YES
God, please HBO. Don't fuck this up.
When David and Dan are out of the picture, but Ramin Djawadi keeps his job. Hope this show does not turn out a catastrophe.
Is that black guy supposed to be Corlys Velaryon? I have nothing against casting black actors, but don't cast a black man as a pure-blooded Valyrian character. I hope this show is good.
I mean, this looks really good, but when you already know the ending of this whole saga - what's the point of the prequel?
Try not to fuck this one up
Just make sure Dumb and Dumber doesn't get their hands on this series...
Please please please, don't fuck it up on the last season. Start it good, finish it good.
Wow... Awesome... House of Dragon Is Waiting Our World....World's biggest ,Blockbster, Legend,Eips History This Web series GAME OF THRONES (HOUSE OF THE DRAGON)❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fool me once.....
Ngl, I'm still waiting for someone to actually get injured in the throne, for a throne made of swords you'd think at least 1 of the people who sat there or at least got too close would get cut or something.
black targaryen?
HBO MAX 💜     👍
Oh wow, there were black people in Valyria?
Not gonna lie that Targaryen dragon armor looks good D&D are not here to mess things up this time around. Looking forward to it I literally don't care if it's good or bad, I just wanna feel good again, I've never liked any movie & series after I watched GOT.  Me after S8: I don't really want anymore *Watches this trailer*: NVM INJECT THAT SHIT INTO MY VEINS Daenerys(GoT, 2012) - "I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true." Daemon(HOTD, 2021) - "Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did."
Benioff and Weiss aren't involved with this project, so it's already worth a look. I pirateted every episode of Games of Thrones and still felt ripped off.
El juego continúa...
THE DOCTOR!!!!!!!
I hope they don't f it up, 😂
Seems nice!! I liked the change on the iron throne - it is a liiiitle bit closer to the book- I would liked if they had dare to make it a liiitle bit taller as well... Also why oh why a black Corlys?? The actor looks great ..but why?
m I the only one who is getting emotional 🥲🔥🐉
Prince Philip: The Origin Story.
Ok this looks fucking amazing, dragon armor looks DOPE!
മലയാളി ഉണ്ടോ
if they messed it up again im gonna sue
Black Targaryen wtffffffff, stop destroy movies.
Who's the black guy?
saalaverga
I think I just peed a little from the excitement! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️
Everything other than the random black dude that looks out of place seems great.
Nobody: Matt Smith's chin: Hey
Hype is coming  Let's not forget that Game of Thrones had almost 70 amazing episodes and only a few disappointing ones. And HBO is pumping big money and talent into House of the Dragon. I have a really good feeling about this
Escena del " El Caballero errante" ? belleza!
Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did! 🔥🔥🔥
0:29 I don’t know who she is but for some reason she doesnt fit for the role. She looks like an ordinary woman in cosplay. Thats a huge no from me. Hopefuly I will change my mind after seeing an actual scene with her, not just her face.
0:35 that armor is so fucking beautiful. i want one.
Please, don’t ruin this.
Got my sword and some other nerd stuff ready for this!!
Thank god weiss and benioff doesn't have to do anything with it.
Sorry HBO...I'm sure the actors and crew have done fine work...but after the abysmal conclusion to the original series, I find I have zero interest in this, any other spin-off, and the GoT franchise in general.  I wish you luck, but this will not encourage me to sign up for your service.
Assim você me mata HBO, Hypeeeeeeeeeee
Well well well , look at this HBO , you have all my attention !  👀
New game of thrones begin in 2022🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
just caME here to dislike , the way they butchered got
goosebumps. im ALL in 100%
Sorry HBO. Maybe everyone forgot but i didn't the way you stabbed our hearts before. Not gonna watch. It's a no from me. I have trust issues with you on this matter
the next GOT
And John snow, u know nothing 🤪
Enough of the effing prequels. Give me a story I don't know the ending of. And I'm sure every episode will have some dumb premonition of things to come. Boooring.
That looks great :)
Awesome. Daenerys was my favorite character in GoT. Looking forward to this new series.
Yes, i'm ready for this. But still, they did Dany really bad.
Everyone gonna be upset Daenerys died all over again after watching this
What a background music.❤️ I'm impressed 💪
Holy motherforking shirtballs
SO FUCKING HYPED! Be prepared for a longer post right now, you don’t have to read it. Even though season 8 was awful and ruined my favorite characters arc I have an emotional attachment to GOT. It was the show my partner and I watched together before they passed away suddenly in 2018. I had spoken to them at midnight while they were at the hospital getting antibiotics for pneumonia. I wake up 6 hours at most later to a call that they died. So I rewatch the show occasionally just to enjoy something we both did and to feel it again!
I got chillss 🔥🔥
That look 00:35
Edit 🔥  house  of the Dragon is coming  2022
Coração chegou errar a batida
I still have a horrible taste in my mouth from season 8 of GoT.    Not really excited about this.
Meh.
Can't wait to invest 8 years into this other show just to have some greedy showrunners fuck it up because they're already thinking about their next project
All hail the Dragons
eyyyy
Looks great! Now give us raised by wolves season 2!!
I'm so excited for this. I am, however, not as excited about the inevitable incest shippers. Targaryens are cool. How there got to be so many is decidedly less so.
The Iron Throne with spikes in the ground around it looks better. Well, in general everything looks amazing.
just keep D&D away from it PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
You can tell that this is gonna be epic by just hearing the soundtrack
OMG OMG OMG yes!!! Targaryen, a fallen  dynasty.
0:38 is that house velaryon?
I’m in happy tears after watching this …. Proud Fan of Game Of Thrones 💕💕💕😍
EU TO ARREPIADAAAAAAAAAA
I'll wait until the show is completely over and I find out if it actually had a good ending to watch it
So so happy they got the throne right, much closer to the book description
Can't wait
Where are the dragons?? 💔💔
Well shit
Waiting for Alt Shift X teaser review...
WHAT EVER HAPPENED WITH SEASON 5-8 BETTER NOT HAPPEN AGAIN 😭😭😭
Well at least they have a finished book to work with lol...
This Was...  SICK!!!!!!!!! #HBO
Ahhhhh...... I quit watching HBO after 8 seasons of GOT and waiting for the worthed ending that never comes up. John Snow should be King.  Now this.....not gonna waste my time.
After having all the time I invested watching original GOT rewarded with one of the worst final seasons ever committed to film, I’ll be waiting until this show is completely over for reactions to the quality of that ending before I even consider watching more GOT content.
Been wanting to see these old stories from GOT's universe more than GOT's og story
Let’s hope they don’t butcher this like they did in game of thrones
Dracarys..!!
When I hear those notes... damn, goosebumps
this reminds me how ugly henry cavill's wig is in the witcher.
Ммммм.... хуита.
Who cares when we know the climax is one of the crappiest in human history... it’s dead nothing can bring back unless grrm releases final book with different ending
House of The Dragon, Dune, Wheel of Time, Lord of The Rings, Percy Jackson, Broken Earth Trilogy, Children of Blood and Bone, Red Queen... the next few years are gonna be craaaazy.
😍😍
Please don’t be like season 8 of GoT. I hope the pacing/story is more like the first 4 seasons.
We finally get to see the biggest dragon that ever existed, Balerion The Dread.
This shouldnt be slow burn there are enough battles to have like four per season for like six seasons
*I'm not watching this until it ends and people speak highly about it and its ending.*
Pity the final season of GOT was pure shite.
man i honestly was waiting to see the dragons !!
Dr whooooooo
I would have loved GOT theme play at 00:52
Ooh man,missed those days when we were genuinely excited for each episode of Game of thrones,nowadays its just boring overhyped shows like money heist and squid game
Sorry HBO, I can't open my heart to Westeros again, not yet... I'm still in pain for the season 8 of GOT.
Who's the voice of the narrator? And why does it sound like Ramsay Bolton?
Anything Matt Smith touches turns to GOLD! side note: I hope they increase the brightness. Can't see shit
Omg, cant wait to watch ✨
Actually, i can't wait for watching Sonoya Mizuno portraying Mysaria
where are the dragons? where are the elephants?
Where the hell is Jon Snow?
I wanted the Targaryen theme.
**OOO MY GOD HERE WE GO AGAIN ❤️ NEVER EXPECTED THIS I REALLY MISS THE SHOW AND MUSIC AND EVERYTHING I'M SO EXCITED ❤️**
THE Real iron throne
Promise us you won't get us hooked to only go and take a sh*t on the final seasons??
a lot of black
"Ours is the Fury"
Katta waiting
the Witcher of thrones
OH MY GOD! almost have heart attack...
Good thing all this lore is already there... lets hope they stick to it this time
How many of us will really make it to 2022
This exceeded my expectations. I can't wait to be back in Westeros again! Fire will reign!
After this show ended everyone who owns dragon will start to abandon. Please don't do that.
Y’all idk why your complaining this is house of the dragon not GoT if your gonna boycott the fricking show already after season 8 without this even being a proper trailer y’all really can’t give second chances huh ✋🏻
I'm just waiting for another major geographical restructuring of King's Landing.
WOW!! Can't wait!
omg cant wait
Can't wait so long
I hope D and D direct this.
Lord of Light ensure this doesn't turn to shit like the last one.
Where are the dragons💥
As much as I like the idea of this show, it doesn't have the fantastic source material that game of thrones had. It took them two years to write this show, it takes George ten years to write a book of a song and ice and fire. we can't go in comparing this to game of thrones because we will be disappointed.
"I have dragons now. Dragons are cool."
Waiting from so long time 🥺🥺🥺  now it is here 😻🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Wow.😍
bring back daenerys
Lo gracioso que no tiene mucho sentido ... sabemos como termina los targaryen. Lo que un aegon construye solo un  aegon lo destruye...  Ests serie... no le va ir también como got. Por culpa de got
MEH
HBO MAX BRING YOUR SERVICE IN INDIA BEFORE 2022 PLZ ... VALAR MORGHULIS
I have a bad feeling about the time this will go out. Original GOT appeared before the PC/gender madness... At the first try of virtue signaling from this show I drop.
HOUSE OF BAD ENDING
As long as David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are not involved I’m in.
its so crazy last night i finished the game of thrones for the 3rd time now i come on youtube this morning and see this just wow
😍😍😍😍
Blackfyre Valyrian Steel Sword 0:24  Dark Sister Valyrian Steel Sword 0:37 Book accurate Iron Throne 0:50  It’s actually happening my ASIOAF nerd self is so happy right now
I am not watching if DnD are associated in any way shape or form
Why are there black people
spoiler: a poorly-written spoiled brat ruins everything some time later. the franchise has been ruined by incompetents forever - don't bother.
Lmaoooo targaryens with dreads what kind of moron comes up with this stuff hahahahahaha
New, HBO after dark series...
After the shit you did with the end of GOT, i will never pay for this one.
Doctor Who?
Fucking yeah 😍😍😍😍😍
To see the story of House Targaryen come to life is exciting. I loved how they made the GOT theme sound hauntingly beautiful in this trailer. I’ve been rewatching GOT repeatedly and it never gets old even with the end seasons. I still get teary eyed and choke up at the end of S1 E9. Let’s hope this series lives up to the GOT series.
Season 5 of the Crown looks lit
I have chosen my plan. The plan is illegal streaming. 😂🤣
I've never really rooted for or been interested in House Targaryen, despite being a big GoT fan (novels and HBO series). But, this does look good, and I'm willing to give it a shot. I just wished that we had gotten to see a series based on Robert's Rebellion instead. Although we know the bare bones of what happened, it would've been interesting to see how the events shaped the characters that we got to know in the original series. I think it would've been a good way to shift the perspective in how we think about Robert, Jamie, Cersei, Lyanna, and Rhaegar. It would've also been a great way to bring back Tywin Lannister and all his cunning in his prime.
I was hopping House Hightower would have fair (nearly silver) hair. But well, nothing’s perfect
No thanks. Last seasons of game of thrones was garbage
HBO: here's a preview of our show about dragons, where a war is fought entirely with dragons! Us: oh cool! Will we see any dragons in the trailer? HBO: ....no.
Fine I’ll watch this but if you people end this show similar to the massively horrible way you ended GoT I swear I’ll never watch hbo again.
Is that THE dagger?!
I love IT
Can't wait for the man are bad, woman are good mixed with a little diversity.
Looks pretty cool. Can't wait :D
MATT????
Oh shit oh shit 💥 I recently started watching Game of thrones I'm on season 4 this is my first time watching the show how lucky I'm I haven't yet completed the series and I got another already hell yeah💥
As trailers go this doesn’t really excite me. Hope they put out a better trailer.
How do y'all think the targaryens control and hatch dragons will they address that in the show
Eu tô em choque, eu tô em choque.
It's bad that the terrible ending of GoT has made me uninterested in this 😩
Too soon! I haven't healed - RIP Daenerys. Gone too soon😪
So we are all pretending that we have moved on from S8 disaster.
Welp, I am ready to get hurt again.
Chega logo 2022!!
I really wish HBO would hire people who understand typography and kerning
Why not in 2021..🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏
It's happening 😌
Season 8 completely destroyed me, but i will watch this anyway!
"200 years before the fall of the throne"  God no please don't remind me of that
I just hope you guys don't fuck this up like you did with The Many Saints of Newark.
Matt Smith is not really a good looking person plus having to look like  a Targaryen it's kind of difficult to pull off with that hair color. Nevertheless I'm still excited for this series.
This is an interesting prequel to "The Crown"
“where dragon?” -me
Please tell release date
If the black guy with dreadlocks is meant to be Corys Velayron, that doesn't really make any kind of fucking sense at all. Hopefully it's good.
Why the black people With all the respect...unnecesary If you want black people go search novels with black people!! Black people watch and read the shpw and the books no matter if theres not a single black! This is frustrating. Unnecessary progressism. Im mexican and I dont ask for mexicans in this show
Builds it up big and great and fucks it up in the end! Just sayin! This time with Dunkin' Donuts or KFC or Chipotle box on the set.
THE IRON throne looks litle funky now but ok>
Am I the only person who heard Joffreys voice??
Well, at least the throne is slightly better
Please stay true to the source material! No forced pc culture shit please.   Guess we can say summer is coming?
I’ll watch it just because I already have an HBO subscription. But after the shitshow that was the final seasons of GoT I’m not excited about it. Especially when you know what it leads up to.
is this going to be a retelling of ONE event, or is it going to retell the whole Targaryen Dynasty until Aerys II?
So weird seeing the best Doctor Who as a Targaryen. Love it!
This is the Targaryen vindication i needed after Season 8. Daenerys has the last laugh.
Can't waitttt
Hindi dubbed please 🥺
Dragon where?
DONT PLAY WITH US AGAIN!!!! BETTER BE THIS GOOD!!!
please be a chronological show, from begining to ending
Can't wait to see this, but it still hurts to think about how D&D destroyed the ending.
Well, at at least with this one we know the show runners won't have to make shit up at the end to finish the story.
WAKANDA FOREVER!
incoming All the fakeass fans who were bad mouthing HBO and got as well as the directors and the fans who have been championing this prequel the whole time because we they've been excited and loyal TRYING TO NOW ACT LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN LOYAL FANS AWAITING THIS THE WHOLE TIME JUST BECAUSE THEY SEE HOW BADASS IT LOOKS TO BE NOW! lol these morons are all gonna act in the comments like they never were shit talking the idea of this prequel because of the last season of game of thrones smh PATHETIC YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE! and to the rest of us that have been loyal undying fans of game of thrones always aware of how amazing its been even with its shortcomings and the cultural phenomenon it had become?? CHEERS! WE SHALL DIG INTO THESE NEW STORIES TOGETHER LIKE WE DID THE LAST TIME GAME OF THRONES HIT OUR SCREENS
Welcome back my real world….bye bye earth!!!
The Doctor really took a detour.
Ok, I disliked everything about this except for that final shot of the throne. Damn
Finally the wait is over.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Dracarys 🔥🔥🔥🔥
HYPE HYPE HYPE
Amazing!!!
holy crap I thought this was fake but thank you baby jesus
Im one of few who didnt watch any episode of game of thrones. and im going to be 1 of the few whos not going to watch house of dragons. :)
It's worth waiting for🐉
Will they show the village on dragon stone they never did in got
where are the dragon bones in the throne room???
PLEASE REMAKE SEASON 8 OF GOT
This shot just gave me chills
let's go......
" HBO Max is better than Netflix. "  You can't Change my mind.
Looking forward to see the Kingslayer.
Just don’t mess this up like you did to one of the best shows ever. Went from best to worst in a matter of season lol.
Oh yes, sooo hyped!  Can't wait to be sorely disapointed by this!
ووووووووووووووووووه واااااااااع أخيرًا
🖤
A real Dance of Dragons....
Ok, the ending of Game of Thrones sucked, but from what it sounds like, it sounds like a lot of that “effort” that made Season 8 terrible was more on D&D then Martin or HBO. With that in mind, I’m keeping an open mind about House of the Dragon.   Kinda wish they wouldn’t start at the Dance of the Dragon, but maybe Aegon’s Conquest, but again, open mind.
BROOOOOO. Seeing the Iron Throne at least somewhat resemble the throne in the books is giving me chills.
Dracarys
Just waiting for the Khaleesi with her dragon.
dio dai mille volti FINALMENTEEEEE!!! Caxxo che brividi!!! Un drago però ce lo potevano mettere
Anyone else spot a familiar Dagger at 0.42 ?
I would like to remind everyone of the writing without the source material
I am waiting
Dragons… yes
a reason to keep alive until 2022: check ✔
🔥
how many bloody beach scenes are there in this thing?!
Just imagine if S7 and S8 were good. This prequel show would be the most anticipated of all time.
Omfg omfg omfg
I'm nervous, but I'm just glad Olivia Cooke is getting more recognition.  Please let this be goooooood!!!!
Wonder if we’ll see 3 eyed Bran roaming around? Perhaps this show can elaborate on the 8 season Bran ark that fizzled to nothing
This has the Star Wars sequels problem: What is the point of adding extra lore, regardless of whether it's good, if it just leads to the events of Season 8 of GoT?
I just hope they give houses other than Targaryen, Velaryon and Hightower their due. Remember it’s the complicated web of schemes, alliances, ambitions, friendships, resentments and feuds that made GoT so darn interesting.   This time we won’t be so naive to believe it’s a worthy adaptation until we see at least the final trailer because FANBASE REMEMBERS!
Damn....Did i just see Matt Smith?
Looks shit.
Black Valerians  are product of being to much under dragons fire?
Despite the fact that GOT ending sent me into a depressing confusion. I am excited about this, a new director, the same epic composer and targaryens my favourite house am in.
Ugh 😒
still don't have that throne right
Corlys black velaryon 😂😂
A tense King Viserys at the return of Daemon from the Step Stones, to pledge his allegiance
Can’t wait to be squinting at my screen at the night time scenes lol
I'm optimistically cautious last season of GOT burned me hard.
Ion care if corlys a black corsair, what people should be going crazy about is them not having purple eyes
Wow💥
I’ve not seen GOT but this does look good.
Ngl way too late for me to have any interest. The way the last series was butchered at the end ruined any rewatching of one of my favourite shows because even the good seasons plots are all rendered pointless, I have so little faith in this being decent all the way through now I just don’t wanna see anything. I will be genuinely curious how it does viewership wise though since I know a lot of people who loved early game of thrones feel the same as me.
One series ,the whole world is waiting for!!!!!!
https://youtu.be/ML8bHBDT-BA
😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We’re going back to Westeros people 🏆🔥
Who is lead role in this show and who is king of seven kingdoms plss reply?
MALAYALI
Retconning established world building and injecting “woke” identity politics for the sake of “inclusivity.” 😒 Yay... Can’t wait to watch the ratings hit no where close to the original show, which was ruined with the last two seasons anyway. Hard pass.
Fire&Blood was set 300 years before GoT. This show is taking place 200 years prior. It would be nice to get just a liiiiiiittle of Aegon, Visenya, & Rhaenys / The Doom of Valyria before jumping into House of The Dragon . Just one episode of history please 😭
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Consider me officially hyped! Please learn from the mistakes of the last season and bring back the GOT we all fell in love with! Can’t wait 🔥🤟🏻
Matt Smith looks good with white hair XD Never realized he could play such a serious role. Also thinking about one of the Doctor Who hypostasis!
THE HYPE IS REAL LADIES AND GENTS
Are they keeping those.two chumps away from this one? We're not going to watch this one for years and have them crap all over it like last time?
Can't wait to see Daemom on Caraxes and Aemond on Vhagar, Rhaenys on Meleys, all the dragon riders... I HOPE THEY STAY TRUE to the Dance....
I hope this will be a big F*CK YOU to Dan & Dave.
Ah sh*t, here we go again
OMGLSKSS
Plenty of dragons in that era. No dragons in trailer...
Ok. Tô sem estruturas pra isso! Tá mt perfeito
Just please, please plesse dont fuck this one
Criston Cole v. Tarly, lit
wowwww
I clicked this with all the contempt that season 8 of GOT filled me with... and after the trailer, god damn it I want to see more... Please HBO for all of our sakes.. PLEASE make sure that your show runners are in this for the long hall!!!!!
I hope this isn’t a low budget show
You know. This would have more hype if y'all didn't always screw up the final seasons of your shows. I'm not getting invested after Sapranos, True Blood, and Game of Thrones.
YES!!!!!!! So excited for this!!!
EVERY character in this teaser looks amazing
YESSS
Remember, people: *this* is what they screwed up GOT for.
Please dub rest of episode of game of thrones
Is this created by the same pair of idiots who screwed up the main show?
It doesn’t matter how much they are powerful, the throne gonna has a shitty end 🤣
Who cares, the HBO Game of Thrones universe died with Season 8
Miguel Sapochnik is a showrunner on this, who was the director of some of the best GoT episodes, specifically Battle of the Bastards and The Winds of Winter. Have faith people, this will be legit.
Nos van a dar otra vez ocho temporadas y luego un final todo qlero
"im not gonna watch it because of season 8!!!" stfu. you'll watch it.
Is that Doctor Who!!!
WHERE ARE MY DRAGONSSSS??
Khaleesi 💥
It's not gonna beat the game of thrones series
WIsh I could get excited for this franchise but nope. Something about having cakes and eating them too, HBO.
This will also be released in hindi ?? Tell me plz !!
Don’t mess this one hbo
We are Targaryen  ,we are the conquerors ♥️
Don’t mess this one up!!
I'm gonna watch it, but to be honest I'm not hyped. Season 8 had put a very bad sour taste in my mouth about this whole universe. Hopefully this show will make me excited for it again.
Is that... Ramsay Bolton narrating?
Can’t wait🥰🥰🥰
No matter what this show is like, always remember, in the future Arya kills the night king
We have entered the Golden Age of Fantasy.
I can't wait for them to make prop replicas of Blackfyre and Dark Sister. I want to buy those so much.
Power💥W8ing💝
don't mess this up like you annihilated everything you build up in Rome and GOT. i hated that i wasted my precious time watching this c**p
After the end to GOT I just dont give a shit anymore :) Thanks D&D
Some Valirians are black with blond hair now, because  "diversity"
We needed our GAME OF THRONES back.... But, they are giving us something better🔥🔥🔥hope it'll be better... Btw ANY GOT FANS???
I'm sure that there will be at least one scene that someone kills someone by dropping them on those swords
STILL NOT FORGIVEN FOR SEASON 8
I truly truly hope I'm wrong but this looks like this is going to be a rip-off. The trailer gives Hollywood meets Netflix vibes. Fingers crossed they remain faithful to Fire & Blood and its intricate and complex stories. Less CGI, more unexpected turns and competent writing. If I'm being honest though, I'm already disappointed by the mere existence of this show as it will never ever make up for how bad they let us down with GOT final seasons.
Black targaryen ahahahahah. Very nice HBO
Who is excited about that feeeling that GOT fans get when they was watching GOT so7. Old days are back
"Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons did." - The Eleventh Doctor, 2021
Memories of  GOT's worst ending just revitalized. Hope it will be better.
Ramsay narrating the trailer. This is going to be fun.
Bleaching my hair silver
Nope
no Latinos ?
They are selling us a product, and the last product we bought from them sucked ass. I know better than to delve into this story and expect competent writing.  This looks like a polished turd.
Yaaaaay!!!
The end of GOT completely ruined this show for me
Waah bhai baddia h 👌🏻🥰
Doctor?
This feels like garbage
😍😍😍😍😍
You guys know how that story ends, do you?
Хочу! Хочу! Хочу! Хочу смотреть!
Can't wait
O ho ho....start getting GOT vibes🤩
HBO are you mad? Corlys is played by black guy? This is Westeros not USA
Mixed feelings since that abismal GoT ending
Definitely going to watch this.
Geliyor gönlümün efendisi
No Tyrion, no Game of thrones.
Black targaryens…
Sure everyone's hyped. But just remember, it all ends with a sociopathic boy in a chair trolling the entire world to become King. Just remember that when you see the dragons.
Cannot wait for this!
People:but I thought you wanted nothing to do with game of thrones? Me:Why do you think I came all this way?
Might watch the first episode. See how it holds up. But is there a name for like...negative hype? Where references to things we know might actually do more harm than good? If HBO aren't going to fix season 8, then House of the Dragon should distance itself as much as possible. Let's see how it does.
As long as Dumb and Dumber stay the fuck away from the show, this can be awesome
*Trivium has entered the chat*
YOOOO ITS MATT SMITH!
This looks amazing! Can't wait for Season 8.
Dragon Lovers....this is Valhalla for you...
Not creating expectations anymore...  Especially because the most boring thing about GoT was Boringnerys and her dragons: what made GoT interesting was the dialogues and etc...
Will you dubb in hindi
Hopefully this end’s better than Game of Thrones 😒
Please.... release all episode in hindi language also 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏🙏🙏🙏
Que comece a dança dos dragões 🐲🐉🤩 🥳
Can't forget the last scene of season 8  That was really unexpected. I felt very bad for John Snow 💔
Black targaryen? Srsly?
Choose your plan, that’s when some will say to themselves “illegal streaming”
I’m so happy Ramin Djawadi is returning to score the music. Game of Thrones wouldn’t have been the same without his unforgettable score.
Increase your brightness before watching.
Dragon did it? So where are the dragons? Where are them HBO??
Black Targaryen? skipped
This looks like shit, of course now the Targaryens are black, lol, I hate this shit!
HBO, in the next trailer put in caps, BENIOFF AND WEISS NOT INVOLVED!!! It will do wonders for the ratings, trust me.
Who's voice is narrating this? It kind of sounds like the guy that played Ramsey...
OMG I'm so exciting 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SHIIIIIT! That armor, that throne !!!
i mean if season 8 of game of thrones is any indication of  the quality this spinoff, we’ll be extremely dissatisfied
Is this fully based on a book or are they just going to free ball it like the final season of GoT?
Please be as complex as GOT
Let's hope its better than GoT Season 8
We need this in India with HBO max😍
ഇത് പൊളിക്കും 😍🤩🔥💫💥❤💥
*"Dragons made us kings"* Well it would've been nice to show us one in the trailer HBO.
Valar Morghulis
Anything with Matt Smith in it is gonna be good
😍😍😍😍😍
We’ll see…
You better not fuck this up HBO. Better have high quality like early GoT.
bowties are cool
This will only be good if they faithfully follow the books and not butcher that shit like S8
As long as dumb & dumber stay away from this. I am interested.
ah i should start marking my calendar now
Just read fire and blood. V excited
Philip.....
better redo season 8 ...
too bad I already know the end and it sucks. I cant believe how badly the ending of the series was botched. I know! Lets have the spaced out kid be the king! Yayyy! Can we have Bran wake up and it turns out that he was just hallucinating/dreaming he was chosen for king? Then the story can be fixed and the last few episodes never happened?
Hard to take this seriously after last time
More like House of The Cash-Grab...
I respect the changing of the Iron Throne to fit the books more, but, it looks a little silly.
ว๊าบไปปีหน้าเลยได้ไหม 🔥
i feel like a kid on christmas morning
OMG finally😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
GOD A MAIOR DA DÉCADA...
THIS LOOKS SICKKKK
To be honest, did not find this trailer very compelling. Looks more Witcher than GOT, but hopefully it's a quality show that does GOT justice.
Cautiously optimistic... Will have to wait and see what the actors are given, but there is excitement in the air!
I will watch it but im still not over the disapointment of the last season of Game of Thrones,that left me feeling really flat.
HBO’s response to Netflix squid game...
So is this about the civil war?
The costumes look so cheap 😭
Ok.... hm... this actually made me feel more interested than I originally thought I'd be.
THE THRONE LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER!!!
Hope 1st season didn't like  GOT
Awesome……
I hit the dislike button because Daenerys Targaryen made me do it! I would watch it if HBO promised NOT TO KILL OFF WOMEN IN DISGUSTING WAY FOR THE SIN OF BEING AMBITIOUS.
Dr. Targaryen of house Who is here to save the fandom
Still want to see Robert’s rebellion though, as long as there’s a movie or show about it, I don’t care
Actually looks good! Some of the still photos that were coming out made it look like a cosplay version of GoT. Cautious optimism.
Black targeryan?
here we go
Please release HBO Max in India 🥲
How can anyone have faith that this will be even watchable with how terrible season 8 of GoT (and arguably season 7) was.
YES YES YES YES !!!!!!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳
i large part of me really wants to watch this but a part of me knows how it all end and wants to boycott it as a fuck you to hbo
Plz bring season 1-4 GoT energy 🙏🏻
Considering how the GoT series finale was so bad, you'll forgive me if I'm a little skeptical at this new series.
Love you game of thrones...
മലയാളീസ് ഉണ്ടോ 🤪😁
I hope they didn't ruined it with BLM, diversity bullshit, like netflix does. Not everybody needs therapy during their leasure time.
Hah! Not falling for that again
this is going to be S8 part 2. GOT is dead. dumb and dumber killed it.
I hope Matt Smith reprises his role as the eleventh doctor in the realm of big finish
I CAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
That throne is 10x more intimidating with book accuracy and a Targaryen sitting on it. (wish it were a wee bit taller tho)
Please release in Hindi also😭😭
0:42 for Stark
ANSIOSA dmssss 🖤
Why am I hearing Ramsey voice or it just me
Ok I have a question. Is it "an HBO original series" or should it be "a HBO original series"?
Just waiting🔥🔥🔥🔥
Malayaliii Da
Maybe if the fans like it, maybe there is a still chance they redo season 7 and 8 or maybe just season 8 or like give us the "Grrm cut" or something like that.
🔥
Who else felt this sound like ramsey bolton
Its Ramsy’s voice I WONDER HOW.
0:36 they got ornstein in this?
OMG The Iron Throne looks like in the books
I'm not hyped anymore
Finally they are adding more personality to the armor
Please don't f this up, you guys
It's already seems so much batter then Game Of Thrones and I hope it would be can't wait to see it I hope House of Dragon won't make thr same mistakes.
i wish the nigh king comes in this too
The sound effect make my heartbeat fast. Excited for this. From India.
i just started reading fire and blood!
All that money on this trailer and they can even spell properly 🙄 Looks good though
Hoping for a good ending now😁😁
Good now im counting my age again
My expectations are low
oh no
I'll wait after the 1st season and see what the reviews are. I don't want to be disappointed again
Why don’t they hire actors who actually have white-blonde hair? They’re called Scandinavians and they can save you a tonne on hair dye.
*honestly, dont really give a shit after GOT*
I can't wait for it.
Glad to see Matt Smith killin it again
Please don't let us down this time, I'm so hyped about this
Off chance but does anyone know when in 2022 the show is set to air?
I really want to  be excited for this but I can't seeing as how shitty Game of Thrones ended.
Please dont ruin it like you did with game of thrones
Not a very climatic ending though.  Basically, they go around, kick the crap out of everyone, forging a kingdom.  Ride north and the north is like "Nah, you can have it bro" and he makes him his warden in the north.  the end.
Cool. Now don't fuck it up HBO.
Can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!
As long as this won’t end like the shit show got season 8 was.
**puts the dissapointment of GoT season 10 back into the closet** COME TO MAMA!
So happy that the throne room is basically the same set, but more accurate to the books. Ramins music always gives me goosebumps, so I'll probably watch this 100 times 😂
AAAHHHHH I CANT WAIT
Sorry HBO.  Fixed point in time.  It’s a bit timey whimey
GoT:D, for diversity
I don’t want to hear no negativity, keep that to yourself. I am all excited
And I was just thinking about cancelling HBO today
Solo le pido a Dios que no lo arruinen
So long as the new showrunners don't suddenly piss off to do Star Wars films they won't even make, I'm happy with this.
After watching this, I can't wait for Witcher season 2.
So they gonna make more on each House
Really I can't wait
Gonna be complete shite.
First Reaction: Boooooooo  Reaction after finding out Dumb and Dumber aren't involved: Ooooooooo
Can't wait.
Looks great, but what about Aegon's Conquest? Are we just gonna skip 100 years worth of Targaryen history?
BRO the throne, OH that throne. bet ol georgy loved that choice from the showrunners.
Dreams did not make us kings... dragons did shots fired at lord of light 😲
I'll watch it in 10 years. They're going to fuck up in the end.
Cê é loko!
I’m probably only going to watch it because if Matt smith’s character
0:39 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!! BYEEEEEEEE
I would like to remind everyone that this is a separate adaptation of a separate book. Don’t let your hatred of season 8 stop you from enjoying this show. Dumb and Dumber’s ending of Game of Thrones is not the definitive ending of that story, the true ending has yet to be written.
#ReshootSeason8
What makes me hopeful about this show, is that the source material is complete, unlike Game of a Thrones. The Quality for Game of Thrones only started to decline when they no longer had George R.R Martin’s books to go off of. Thankfully, the ending for this story has already been written masterfully.

ok I now get why we did not get much of white walkers...they are gonna milk it while they are at it
I must say, in spite of my disappointment for season 8, this show looks incredible. For those of you who don’t know, Miguel Sapochnick will be returning to direct, he directed Battle of The Bastards, Hardhome, and Winds of Winter. Ramin Djawadi will also be returning to compose the score. George R.R Martin even wrote the first episode himself!

The best thing here are TOC, Targaryans of Colour! :D :D I'm in love in those black, dreadlocked targaryans <3 :D :D best thing in modern tv :D
Me after Season 8 finale : 😡 they ruined it, they fkn ruined it 😭  Me when House of the dragon is announced : meh 👁👄👁  Me now :  *LIGHT THE BEACONS* 🐉🔥
It did not even come out yet, but I can already tell that this show is going to be a masterpiece!!
Actually excited for this...
The North remembers your betrayal
Waiting
NETFLIX; ADJUSTING THEIR RELEASE SCHEDULE SO AS NOT TO CONFLICT WITH HOUSE OF THE DRAGON TO AVOID MAJOR LOSSESS AND HEARTBREAK!!!
Hope it wont get messed later like GOT
Wasn't it gonna be 'House of the Tragaryens'??
not gonna lie. Im going to watch this just for matt smith. go number 11...
2022 what's the point of showing it now
I would also like to know what happened after GoT
Where's the bloody dragons then
Still not over the last 3 seasons
Will it be 8 seasons of build-up for the most asinine, poorly executed, obscene, offensive and dim-witted non-climax in entertainment history? Will I be once again be treated to watch a couple of arrogant hack writers vomitting their incompetence all over a setting that they do not understand?  Yeah, screw this show. I'm not going to watch even just a single damned second of it before I know if it doesn't completely mess up the end in such a way to taint the entire show and every single character retroactively in the last 4 episodes.
I'm hyped by please don't ruin the legacy with a garbage ending like GoT.
LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE WILL MATTER ONCE THIS DROPS
i will love it, im sure of that, but will miss Emilia Clarke, omg 😭😭
Don't give a fuck after how they ruined GoT.
omg i have goosebumps
I doubt the entire seven kingdoms gets formed in the first season. Could be why the throne is small
Man this looks amazing. I really wish they started with the conquest though, and I can't tell you how much I would have loved to see Meagor the Cruel slaughtering countless poor fellows on Balarion the Black Dread.
I am pretty sure GRRM wrote his books with medieval Europe in mind, and there weren't many blacks in Royalties.
Game of throne was like the MCU to me until they fuck me up on season 8
looks like shit thats the truth
Which sigil is the black fella with the white dreads wearing?
It's ok boy there's no d&d here you can enjoy the show
So many white wigs lmao
I love that they tried to make the throne more book accurate!!
He forgot to wear the bowtie
Well, at least they have source material and literally know how all this goes. There's no way they can fuck it up, right? Right...?
Long wait
OMGGGGG I'M VERY VERY EXCITED
Season 8 left quite a scar on me.  I can't get excited for anything anymore.
Black, White, Asian - Looks like a Netflix series.
Uh, excuse me, but there appears to be a distinct lack of DRAGONS in your trailer.
I’m expecting this to be really good. After the mess of season 8, hbo can’t afford a repeat.
One thing I forgot was how viscerally good the music of GOT is. Even just this snippet and I feel like I just rediscovered a drug.
What I’ve noticed:  0:23 Blackfyre/Dark Sister 0:36 Probably Daemon Targaryen (Updated) 0:41 Littlefinger’s Dagger 0:50 Iron Throne with a thousand swords -No Dumb and Dumber -GRRM’s Involvement  Possibilities: -Melisandre’s Return due to being 400 years old   This is getting Hyped up!
only if they coule stay away from diversity game.
Nothing can beat this show, when it comes to giving goosebumbs😍😍❤❤
House of the Witcher
Looking forward to see how the screen writer fit the sonic screwdriver in this show
That dragon growling in the end tho
Yeah leather "knight" armor is cool.😩
HOUSE VELARYON was black? NO
fully torqued
Wird auf jeden Fall geschaut❤️
Where tf are dragons?!
Don't think I'll bother thanks. Even if it's good you'll probably just destroy it in one final season. Not worth investing any more time with it.
Well, can't be worse than GoT... right?
arya stark dagger "Catspaw Dagger" 41 seconds in
What's use to watch anyway , if ending sucks 🥴🥴 ( GOT S8)
What are the stakes when we know how badly it all ends?
GOT back🥳🥳
I’m not even kidding when I say that just yesterday I finished Game Of Thrones for the first time.
SO EXCITED OMG
Don't break our hearts again you cold corporate shits
That Blood of my blood bgm ❤️🔥
Daemon Targaryen 🤯🤯🤯
Dont let D&D anywhere near this
I love HBO. Cant wait for this!
Exciting... Waiting 2022.
Were the dragons present in this timeline??
I would’ve preferred the first attack of the white walkers tbh there was so much that we still don’t know about them and it would’ve been such an interesting concept
Goosebumps all over my body. Can't wait for these!!!
WHEEERE ARE MY DRAGOOONS? Where are they?
Letsssss gooooo
Looks like a bunch of actors with kitchen mops on their heads .  Not digging the obviousness of the wigs
Retcon S8, reshoot, rewrite and then we will care, as far as I am concerned D&D ruined the greatest show ever! The Fandom is dead!
#New wait
XYSAME PALI
This is so exciting haha!
The ending of GoT was very bad. But damn the rest of the series was so good, so I can't write off the entire series based on 1 episode. This looks great though. I always wanted to know and see more of this Era though, the age of dragons and house Targaran. We already heard about this Era, but never seen it.
So excited for this !!
There better be some incest.
DRACARYS
Existed as fuck
Catspaw!
Never thought the day would come where i can genuinely enjoy a show again.
🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
The trailer kinda has dune vibes
Get to work NewRockstars! :D
Ok, where's dragon
I'd probably be excited if Game of Thrones wasn't ruined by Season 8
😊
We want HBO MAX in Saudi Arabia
Targaryen armour looks awesome I really wish jon wore that in the last battle
Waiting for Knight king in the trailer
So basically, you are going to show us the build up before the build up which had the worst climax finale ever? I liked the build up part so, Cool.
The ending will suck anyways.
Wooooooooooo

Çok yükseldim, tüylerim diken diken oldu, Teaser'ı izleyince bile bu dizi olmuş dedim, bilmiyorum belki de acele ediyorumdur olmuş demek için ama siz benim fanboyluğuma verin onu da :)  Taht'ı görünce hepimizin WOOOOW diye bağırdığını biliyorum ama kanıtlayamam :D Yine Kitaptaki gibi bir Taht olmamış ama Game of Thrones dizisinde ki Tahttan 1000 Kat daha iyi olmuş, en azından bu sefer Kitapta ki tahta benzer bir şeyler yapmaya çalışmışlar.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bitte jetzt sofort
Yess 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Glad to hear 'The Winds of Winter' by Ramin Djawadi again...🎶
Incoming 45min trailer breakdown from Preston Jacobs where he discusses life's mysteries for 32min.
F*cking love Matt Smith❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Spoiler Alert: the show will feature a lot of incest.
Any Tamil fans .. 👇👇👇
I no longer trust Game of thrones the first one made things personal with me and the was no apology why supporting a production that is there to disappoint u who once’s to spend their time on disappointments i rather watch something else i love Game of thrones but to do that on the season finally and never come back to fix things with me, i hate Game of thrones its personal with me.
Not gonna watch ...they will end up like GOT
Finally getting to see Balerion the Black....and burning Harrenhal
I'm not going to watch it
Desperately waiting 🖤🖤🖤
I love that they made the iron throne slightly more book accurate.
When is The Last of Us?
Hope you don’t the show doesn’t drag on for too long
0:38 ok.
Ahhhhhhh
Woww💥💥
So all this time prince phillip is a descend of a Targaryen
Bored already...
If one thing is for sure is that my boy Ramin Djawadi will not disappoint !!!!!!!
Almost don't want to watch because I don't want to be disappointed again
ill wait till its a complete series. that way i can avoid the ending from the last show repeating....not this time fam. you aint getting me this time. over my dead body.
After season 8 who do they think is watching this?
Going to be crazy 🥶🥵❤
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did." Aegon targaryen laughs in his grave.
Hope it doesn't end a disaster like GOT.
I understand the "Dr.Who" references now.
I literally fainted and got up and completed the video
House of poop and paper. The song of blood and stool.
HBO is trying to make up for ruining got
This Prequel should be called We Wuz Velaryon’s  n Sheet
Great, I love that bit with the sword and that bloke with the long hair and that!
Hoping this one has a better ending.
0:42 Isn't it the infamous Dagger?
0:41 that's aryas 🗡!
Please not D&D
Does it matter if the prequel series is good when all roads lead back to season 6-8 of GoT? Half of Star Wars sucks but they stuck the landing in the OT that’s why people still care about the universe. GRR Martin won’t ever finish the series and GoT threw any future shows under the bus before they even started.
"Two scared children spouting oaths they didn't understand. All that was left of the mighty house Targaryen. Ancient skulls and hatchlings that grow no bigger than cats, all that was left of the dragons."
Another crappy ending after 5 yrs.
Happiest tv moment of the past 4 years probably.
Anyone know if balarion will be in this or is he already dead
I hope Daemon Targaryen wears a fez
Please launch house of dragon in Hind Language also I am big fan from india ❤️🇮🇳
Are you going to ruin this one like you did the last one?
I feel like this show shouldn’t exist but okay
it's gonna be shit
It's real ?
0:50 THE IRON THRONE !!! Damn that chill !!
Corlys Velaryon what a brilliant casting choice, he's only depicted in the book as pale, silver of hair and velvet eyes..like all valyrian people looked like, so thanks HBO of injecting racial identity politics, I just can't get enough of it.
White Walker's honge?
The GOT vibes are coming back!!
We are dealing with incest again ..but I can't wait for it
Spoiler: All die
Watching the iron throne gave me goosebumps ❣
Where's the TARDIS?
i swear to god if they mess this up as bad as season 8 im never watching anything HBO ever again
😍
Im curious as hell that Dragon armor looks dope but im still cautious after the last two seasons of GOT :/ hope this is done right!
"Dusts off old Targaryen Banner and puts back up on wall"
What's the purpose of this series 🥱😓😒😒, Daenerys is dead bruhh, if she was alive in the series it would be amazing to watch HOUSE OF DRAGONS
Yay hurrey
OMGGG
👍
മലയാളീസ് Come On 🦅🦅 GoT Fanss 🔥🔥👍
This looks like a 6/10 ..I can say already…
I'm reading this exact time line right now in Fire & Blood... Very much looking forward to this.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I was waiting for that
Wow, history of Prince Phillips's ancestry is going to be cool.
My heart won't be able to bear it if this flops like Season 8
🙉❤️❤️🥰
Yes. I know this is Targaryen story. But I'm also looking forward to the other houses of Westeros. The magic of this universe is in its powerful dialogue. I hope they live up to the standards of GOT season 1-4. The Varys' and Littlefingers.  I can't wait!
I saw Matt smith and you got me 😩😩😩
Never knew the 11th doctor took the chameleon arch to make himself a Targaryen
Fans from tamilnadu ❤️
lotr>all
❤❤❤
For those asking for dragons look well @0:18 you'll see the head of the dragon
Will this have multiple seasons?
The monster wave of people that canceled their HBO account after GoT ended is going back for another free trial 😂
Market research says no.
After seeing them butcher the end of GoT I have very little desire to watch this.
I thought this teaser was just a rumor but it's true 😭 , i can't fucking wait!!!!
you show nothing HBO
You mean 200 years before the fall of good writing.
I’m ready to be hurt again!
Love from india
let's fuckin go, don't fuck it. the content is there lads, don't fuck it up.
I hope they don't fuck it up
Waiting
They've ruined Game of Thrones so incredible hard, not even this first look teaser can make me cheer for it again.
I'm so excited for this series😀😀😀😁😁😁💞💞💞
I’m here for sword fights and dragons. Let fucking get it.
👀
💥
Honestly I was far more excited to find out what went on in the Age of Heroes "Blood Moon" series that got axed.  I feel like I've had enough Targaryen politics and details to last several lifetimes....but tell me the deep lore behind the ancient legends?  Hell yes please.  I think HBO took the safer and less interesting series option here.
Rated or unrated?
How many seasons are there going to be?! 🤗
I'm in
ARE THEY GOING TO GIVE UP ON THIS IN THE FINAL SEASON AND RUIN THE WHOLE SHOW TOO?
Please tell me that Benioff and Weiss are not behind this ;/
The king in the North 💯💯
no purple eyes?
If we watch a new era........
It’s cool that they actually used the iron throne from the books rather that pos in GOT
Oooh boy. Hope ya don't let Dumb&Dumber ruin this series for ya, but I'm not getting my hopes up untill the last season is wrapped up & deemed decent this time.
omgggg
MAKE A SPIN OFF WHERE SHE WINS PLEASE 😈😡😡😡, i’ll donate i think as a fan base we would all pitch in just to make a dent into a one episode of seeing the final episode change and make her win
But we already the know the future of this story and its sucks especially the final season
After knowing what it all leads to…who cares? Thinking about GOT makes me sick
just sucks we aren’t getting the original Long Night as a series, but this should be good
Here we come!!!!!
This is fucking awesome.. damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Back to Westeros.
Asians and black in middle ages?  HBO: hold my gay
I cannot believe Jon Snow destroyed this dynasty forever
Black Targaryens(Velaryon house) is a big stupid mistake. Oh yeah, who cares🤷‍♂️  P.S. If they want inclusive cast - there are already tons of kingdoms and cities in Essos based on other non-white cultures, just involve them, why retcon main house?
Lord Corlys and his family looks dope 🔥
Is this based on Ageon the conqueror or dance of the dragons damn I’m hyped up over this trailer
My fiance has never seen GoT, we are currently in Season 4 - it is SO fun to watch it with someone who has never seen it, after me watching the entire seasons more than a few times lol. PS: She hated Joffrey by episode 5 of season 1
Is matt smith suppose to be viserys or daemon?
Daenerys Targaryen's character was done the dirtiest in Season 8, yet her legacy is what will draw most people to watch this series
Valar morghulis
Excelente producción y mejor fotografía, felicidades mil Alex
It's called House of the Dragon because HBO is betting you're willing to get burned twice by the plot.
🔥💖💖
and this is how netflix die again
I AM DYINGGGGGGGGGGGG
Hopefully Hot Pie Senior can be the hero of the show.
No. Just NO. After the way you guys ruined Game of Thrones I am never trusting you again. I have never seen a show rated as “the greatest show on earth” become so irrelevant so fast. I don’t think anyone should bother watching this.
Adjusting my brightness settings in anticipation.
And de 17 Dragons?

Normie always complain :3
0:41 Guys look at the hilt

Who are these guys with similar hair color to the targaryens be the symbol of their house isn't a 3 headed dragon or are they with the targaryens? And that dragon over the candles kinda reminds me of Irohs dragon in the spirit world
:(
,,Matt Smith, are you wanna play Witcher or Doctor" Smith: Yes
Another 8 years?
I'm still mad........but i will probably watch this lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hair Stylist: How Blonde do you want your hair?  Cosplayer: Yes.
ഇത് പൊളിച്ചടുക്കും...
I'll watch it if Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb aren't directing it
Yep the game of thrones SpinOff. They are milking it now.
Oh look at me getting likes for hating on GOT writers at the last minute lol

Guck. Uz
Me         :  So, when Winds of Winter and Dream of Spring is coming ? George  :  Enjoy this Prequel. Me         :  So maybe Never
Finally a ASOIAF show that will be epic from start to finish. Can't wait for the Dance
Stabil
Bittersweet, we won’t be seeing the cast we grew fond of 😪. I’m still super pumped of for this, watching the Targaryen Dynasty collapse and see it circle back to the last 2, technically 4 survivors...all those civil wars, the mad king, Drogon, Rhaegar...Oh goodness!
My favourite Doctor 😢
After season 8 of Game of Thrones, I pretty much lost all interest in the franchise. By far the worst last season of a show I have ever seen. Hopefully this show can stand on its own and remove itself enough from that train wreck to actually be enjoyable.
Me         :  So, when Winds of Winter and Dream of Spring is coming ? George  :  Enjoy this Prequel. Me         :  So maybe Never
Kind of forgot…
Im afraid to watch this after season 8...ohhhh...but I want to hope...
Thank youu!!! I am waiting for this 😍😍
dreams didn't makes Us king dragons did 🐲🔥
THEY FIXED THE IRON THRONE!
لو صدق بيطلع نار مستني احر من الجمر 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Yo guys GoT made us rich we cant let that die, any ideas?"
Matt smith dies in 1st season. Anyone wanna bet?
Can't wait!! Let's just hope D&D ain't the writers for this
1,1 million views in only 4 hours... quite an achievement :D
Looks good, but I still would rather be seeing "The Long Night."
Daemon Targaryen: I ride dragons now, dragons are cool
Won't lie and say I am not a little apprehensive considering how GoT ended... But will of course watch.
I can't enjoy a got show remembering the awful final season 😢 damn you D&D Damn you!!
i'm gonna dislike it just cause i'm still disappointed with the last season and i'm not feeling this one as well
2022 is too far. Please make it faster.
If only Littlefinger would be alive to start counting.
After Game of thrones debacle I don't have much interest in this series Good bye
Please no season 8 of this
Valar Morghulis
Ahhhh emocionada estoy 😭❤
This is great. Perfect even but PLEASE GIVE THEM PURPLE EYES

“Dreams didn’t make us kings.Dragons did”  Robert Baratheon : Hold my hammer!
I would be more welcoming to this if they didint mess up the main series not very exciting when you no what the story leads to😂
Awwww Shit !!! Its here baby!! 😀🧝‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️🧝‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️
2022🌟
Honestly so hyped
Is this also based on the books
Can’t wait to see it... thanks HBO❤️
They couldn’t resist adding black characters where they don’t belong smh
I was still hoping we had a prequel GOT show that covered Aegon’s conquest (still hoping they do that), but I guess a show that covers the Dance of Dragons is fine as well.
You butchered GoT. I don't give a single fuck about this series.
Sick.
Nice to see King Ezekiel from The Walking dead playing the same roll. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Hmm so no dragons in the trailer. Interesting
Sick.
Can't wait to see dragons again
I've waited for this!
The terror of the night is coming
Hopefully this one has more fantasy and less people talking BS
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did." You didn't have to do Daenys like that mate.
I am waiting for the TARDIS
00:37 MINHA NOSSA, já tá pra ter uma noção que a qualidade de série não vai diminuir.... *me tremendo todo aqui* 🐲🐲🐲
An accurate iron throne at last
We need hbo max in France
This is the best day of this month so far.
I think i just saw GOT throne 🤔
“Dreams didn’t make us kings.Dragons did”  Bran Stark : hold my chair!
Cregan Stark about to show how an actual Stark behaves. His mass executions gonna be brazy. Would also show how ruthless the Starks were before Ned made them honorable
Hbo max: choose your plan. Me. I plan not to be fooled. dragons screen time 5 seconds . Meh!
I hope those black people are not Targaryen please! It would be just ridiculous
I wonder if he'll have a short redheaded best friend.
Better than season 8 .
Daenerys(GoT, 2012) - "I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true." Daemon(HOTD, 2021) - "Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did."
😍
Meanwhile George R. R. Martin is....
Can watch it without seeing got ?  And yes I will see got later on I know that is fantastic 😊
Hype
Please don't ruin it like the original.
Looks good 👍
No 4K Video? wow !
looks shit
So this is what George has been doing instead of writing the books
omen i am excite
What the hell is to DISLIKE
Ngl knowing all this will lead up to season 7 and 8 just ruined everything
hbo you guys need to release 4k trailers it just looks like garbage on my screen
Let's gooooo
OMGGGG!!!! Blackfyre, Dark Sister, A book accurate iron throne, HOUSE VELARYON anddddddd Stark Banners!!! GO HBOOOO DO YALL THINGGGG!
0:23 Is that the Blackfire? The legendary Valiryan steel sword?
Season 6-8 killed it for me  Don't care
Not a game of thrones guy myself but hearing Matt smith sounds pretty sick might be tempted to watch this.
nobody cares anymore
"AHHHHH DADDY"
1.1 Million Views in 4 hrs.
Alllright everyone.....lets get peoples hopes, expectations  high up ....and ..drop it at the last season...Itwas freakin hilarious last time...🥲
So the whole house Velaryon is black.... 🥴
I don't understand why you people are so exited. Did you forget how bad were last seasons ? Or there are no good shows now and you are ready to  watch everything .
I don't trust you.
Goosbump
Welcome to another episode of "sweet  home Alabama" !
Please not the same producers. Thnaks
What about Daenys the dreamer and her dreams?
Maybe they behead D&D in the 1st season?🤭
I honestly still would’ve rather had the first prequel they planned.
La Casa Del Dragón!!
A surprise to be sure but a welcome one. Seriously I have been waiting for this teaser for so long and it delivered
Targeryeon r trash, Starks all the way
Not this time, Satan.
Cant wait
As long as Benioff and Weiss have nothing do with it I'll watch it.
Guys, will the series also show us Robert's Rebellion?????..wanna see Ned freakin' stark in action....
Dude I finished got a month ago and was sad I wish it continued it but I am happy
Is beautifull
We need dragons here
THEY FINALLY GOT THE THRONE RIGHT
Race swapping characters and retconning story points for inclusivity doesn't make any sense. Corlys Valaryon is not a african character, not as he was described in the books. He was of pale skin with velvet eyes. I highly doubt it that george actually created the character to be like this. He does not look like a man of velaryon decent. He looks like a man from the summer Isles. Im just irritated when people take established characters and then race swap them for just because........People rave about inclusivity. Then called racist in pointing out the inaccuracies. If corlys was of Summer Iles decent and was a member of the Targaryen dynasty, that i would accept. What i wont accept is when you retcon established canon and lore so you fit it with some political agenda that results in undermining the story entirely. It has happened in other mainstream experiences and they lost money at the box office for it. It might happen again with this. So go ahead destroy me, tell me im "racist" because you know im not.  This just does not make since. It Just was not how the character was established. If he was designed to look like that in the books, it would fit. But this is not Corlys Velaryon. He just looks like a lousy cosplayer.
Knowing the way the overall story ended, all these prequels feel a little pointless...
But you don't understand....       Shes ma Queen
we just want a sequel and not prequels and that the Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragon lives. #Make_it_happen. #CLIT_Toh_Ris or was it #drah_KAH_ris, can't remember.
Cant wait for season 8 of this!!!
Is that.... is that a black Targarian? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢 🗑
So hyped for this
പൊളി 🔥
HOPE THIS DOES NOT END LIKE SEASON 8
0:34 night king spotted
Superb
Suppppper excited
LETS FUCKING GO
After the absolutely shitty ending of Game Of Thrones, I'll wait until House Of The Dragon is over before watching it to avoid another huge waste of my time.
HBO please bring your A+ game. Don't let shitty writers ruin great series like GoT! Thanks.
Uffff.. que bestialidad  El trono de hierro lo apegaron más a los libros 🔥🔥🔥
well this is funny, I always saw some people say Daenerys was carried by her dragons and she would be nothing without them. always argued back to them saying it's because of her dreams and ambition. now, this show directly says the opposite. it was the dragons all along
John Snow is watching 🙄🙄
0:48 The Fucking Reason Of Whole Anarchism
Oh shit here we again 😱
Game of Thrones was bottom tier from season 5-8. Season 8 is arguably some of the worst media I've ever watched...   Why should I be interested in backstory for it?
Is this taking place in King's Landing or Dragonstone
Wait so this is about Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters? I thought it was about Old Valyria.
Idk if I can trust another game of thrones series. After season 4 the show was trash, but it went into shit tier at end.
Black Targaryen. Let's make a movie about george floyd and Muhammad Ali. But they will be acted by white swedish men
Still doesn't eliminate the awful aftertaste the last season of GoT left.
Fuck yeah!!!!!😬
Am I the only one who has lost Interest after they ruined the GoT finale.
Aegon’s Conquest was about 300 years before GoT/ASoIaF. Also Corlys Velaryon/the Sea Snake was Westerosi. But I guess source material doesn’t matter 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
മലയാളി ഉണ്ടോ???
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #ReleaseTheAyerCut
Still waiting for GoT Season 9 where everything from Season 7 & 8  just turns out to be a vision of Bran...
This will have an actual ending, but I’ll still be excited with caution ⚠️ GRMM (the author) along with another writer wrote the first episode together. This will be coming out next spring, which is not far from now. We can only hope for the best. Based on the first teaser so far this could pick up the show if done right. This looks promising but my expectations are incredibly low after the disaster Dumb and Dumber did to the Game of Thrones show.
"Ok guys heres 17 easter eggs you might have missed" Me: OMFG🤣  This is gonna be great
Não vejo a hora de me decepcionar com isso
Its real?
#HBO, вы же понимаете, что из-за вас, Мартин никогда не закончит "Ветра зимы"?
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I am so Happy 😀😀😀 I can't stop crying 😭😭😭
So excited!! I never watched another serie can make me feel so damn enthusiast, can’t wait!!
Só não vale ter um final ridículo! Por favor.
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!! I CANT WAIIITTT
THANKS  😍
I'm officially excited! 🐉⚔️👑
Geral deve saber como acaba. mas já gostei.
can't really forget the shit show ending of got to be honest, sorry
A series no one wanted, answering questions no one asked.
Yeah, don't care. Hope it's good
They still couldn't get the throne done. What a puny imitation. It is not that hard, guys. Around 4 meter high stairs, stairs are made of swords. Another 4 meter for the back. Stick with the original.
This Trailer !!!!! My God I AM BEYOND EXCITED
Wait is that Iwan Rheon narrating?!😍
I'm still mad about Season 8
Come in India and dubbed gmame of theone all episodes in hindi language plz
Nope
Not gonna lie that Targaryen dragon armor looks good
They always make these Prequels afterward but they are no fun.  You already know who's gonna live and die and in this case it's 200 years ago which means everyone in this show is already dead, there's no one here that you know, and these people have almost no relation to the ones that you do know. You also know what happened to all the dragons. That sounds like a loooooot of Fun!!  If they rather made a sequel with some of the past characters, that would have been more interesting.
Alright. I am now willing to spend 2022 on this planet :)
WE WUZ TARGARYENS AND SHIEEET
*not from the people who brought to you GoT*
There wasn't no starks in this trailer
Nope, you already ruined Asoiaf once. I won't watch this bastardization too.
Meh
Where Is My Dragon Boy 🐉🔥
By who?
Wow production looks beautiful
If this is written by the writers of s8..m off
Caralhoooooooooo
Who else Waiting for Aegon?
Where is Balerion ?
Please tell me you have writers who have read ALL of the books and novelas GRRM has written this time... no more S7/S8 GoT clown shows.
Jesus amado
Sorry, but that final season Of GOT destroyed any interest I had in this world, I couldn't care less at this point
Goosebumps 🤤
The 5 lead characters will die in a wedding and in the most antipaticed dragon battle, no one will die. 😁 No, hope It'll be amazing.
I request the story writer of House of Drogon don't destroy the Last part just like a GOT.....
For the Rightful Queen Rhaenyra, the First of her Name!
I literally don't care if it's good or bad, I just wanna feel good again, I've never liked any movie&series after I watched GOT.
Can't wait to see those 17 dragons with the strongest one 🤩🤩🤩
THE LONG WAITED ONE IS FINALLY HERE ❤️❤️
With the money they've wasted on this, they could've re-done season 7&8. Does anyone actually care about this, knowing how it all ends.
I would be so hyped for this if the final season of Game of Thrones wasn’t absolutely atrocious
Totally losing my fucking shit here.  Yessss. Great birthday present HBO
That's right! LET'S MILK THIS COW!!! Milk it for as long as we can, for as much as possible!!
We Indians will just look from afar and applause 🥲
you done fucked up hbo. this reeks if desperate
I swear if the ending is like game of thrones
I'll wait and see how the first impressions goes. I'm not ready to be dissapointed again.
Season 8.1
It's wow ! Moment... House of the dragon's is my heart..
I’m taking my money back and put to Amazon prime because they didn’t fuck up a amazing series yet…..
Would be great to hear the khaleesi theme in this series
Still don’t understand why the Valeryon’s are black
Velaryons were not of black skin.... Ffs
Please don’t fuck this up. GOT was my life and season 8 was the biggest let down since Donald Trump got in office.
solo vine a decir que robo autos
Yess!!! I can’t wait 👏🏻
they killed my enthusiasm with those last two seasons
Finish the last episodes of season 8......then we'll talk
YES
Waiting for the dragons 🔥🔥🔥
is it a sequel or a prequel? i have not read the book, sarreh
YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS it looks amazing!!!!!!! its interesting that they changed the design for the iron throne to make it similar to the books. i hope hotd lives up to my expectations
Poli
WOOOOOOOW!!!
so when is got s08 dropping?
Wait, I still haven’t watched got
the best 9$ i spended in my hole life
200 year?
Looking forward to watching this show!
With the amount of Targ incest they might was well start calling it Westertos Virginia
wow
Any loremasters know what the horse/mermaid and archer sigils are for?
Gay...
the THRONE OMG
Don't fuck this up!
Who is this guy?
hopefully they wont fuck this one up as well with a crappy ending
RIP Danearys Targaryen
Can't wait too much 😍😍
I hope everyone learned their lesson from GoT and will refrain from naming their children, dogs, cats, birds etc after their favorite character until their arc is complete.
Ah, here we go again
Why is the velaryon guy black?
As long as D&D aren’t involved there’s hope
Milly Alcock 0:27 will be playing a young Rhaenyra Targaryen, a great choice; she's so good in Upright(recommended), I can't fckin wait! 🤞
New Mortal Kombat logo looks cool!! 👌🏻
Wow prince phillip was still alive this long ago??
Black Targaryen?! OMG)))))))))))))
Council of 101 AL: We decide that only the male line will inherit the rulership. Viserys I: I recognize that the council has made a decision. But given that it is a stupid ass decision I have elected to ignore it.
We're still doing this?
Choose your plan
No thank you. Who remember GoT anyway ?? Even its author forgot about it
Lets all reward HBO for the last season of GOT by watching the same crap again.
Throne room looks stupid. Why not just recreate the insane sword throne from the books.
I haven't recovered of season 8 trauma
"dreams didn't make us kings .Dragons did"
I hope it wont be at the same level than the previous seasons of GOT, where it was a total failure for the fans.
A spin off Prequel, it’s gotta be good right? 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
Was that a black targaryan? Fuck off, I am already hating this show.  Not because I hate black people, but because this is forced representation. My fellow african friends, do not fall into this trickery. It is not by putting black actors into movies and series that you will emprove your lives.  Black actors are casted only for the delight of 16 years old antifa white girls.
Will be shit. Don’t waste your time. What’s the last good release from HBO?
I shouted 🤯
Cool. Now where is True Blood?
you need a better trailer... quality is poor and soundtrack is nothing special. I should have goosebumps after this... a blurred fight scene? wtf...
Hindi dubbed 🇮🇳 plz ...
I still have the bad taste in my mouth from the final season of GOT. I might watch this.
Fuck yes!
Eagerly waiting for this one 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Got a feeling it’s gonna start good and finish going out in flames. Fool me once shame on you, not again
Les rêves n'ont pas fait de nous des rois. Les dragons l'ont fait.
Tangina sana maayos ending nito.
This trailer got my anticipation for this from 0 to 0.
Fool me once...
We Wuz Toorgayrianz and dragon shiet!
Apologies. It looks good and still can be a great show, but the blackwashing of Velaryons scares me.
Something epic, game of thrones season 8, Drogon finds the last Targaryen and he returns with a vengeance and destroys the seven realms and takes the throne for himself…
Yes
Eagerly waiting
um Black Targaryens?....think I'm gonna pass on this. So not here for woke Game of Thrones.
Meu Deus. Obrigado HBO 💕🇧🇷
That voiceover kinda sounds like Ramsey Bolton .
Bowties are cool.
"Almost inhumanly beautiful, Daemon looked every inch the warrior, and many thought that he strongly resembled portraits of Aegon the Conqueror." And yet they cast Matt Smith
OHH MY GODDDDD!!!!!
Why didn’t they use the original GoT set for the red keep? This looks like a really cheap/low budget version of the throne room/iron throne
I’m Ready!!!!!!!!
0:16 made me laugh. Before the fall of GOT 🤣✌️
Looking forward to it.. the only thing is that most of us already know what happens, so I don’t know if this show is gonna be as exciting as GoT. I really hope it is.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSsss
😍😍😍😍
Hopefully this shit isn’t woke. After watching Many Saints Of Newark I’m starting to think HBO has lost its balls .
Is that....THE DOCTOR? 😱
Black Vellarion...bruh
Not that appealing.
Can't wait
Goosebumps
So many Easter eggs in this first trailer alone! Can’t wait for people to break this down. I’m beyond excited to see fire and blood 🔥 🩸
Excelente, saludos desde Perú 🇵🇪
"House of the Dragon"- Doesn´t have a dragon in the trailer. I mean, yeah, there was a Dragon head, but I mean it´s called "House of the Dragon" and not "House of the Dragon-head"
SOOOOO excited for this!!!!
Dragons will rule 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not looking forward to HBO milking this dry with different spin-offs. I'm sorry, but the last season ruined Game of Thrones for me. Will not watch anything that has the name Game of Thrones attached to it. Cheers.
Malayalis pever kanikke💥💥💥💥
Fodaaa
Finally!!! Dragon is coming💥❤
Ik for damn sure I'm gonna enjoy this more than season 8...
Why should we trust you ?
Bend The Fuking Knee 🔥
Game of thrones season 8?... I'm waiting :l
Sadly we know how shitty it all ends
Hopefully it will be better than s8 sinkhole
did anyone else think the narrator that said  " dreams didnt make us kings, Dragons did" sounded a lot like Ramsey bolton?
0:42  House Stark sigil on horse
iron throne is a little different??????
Impressive, I'm really looking forward to it. I found the new throne strange, I know it's more like the one in the books, but there will have to be an explanation for it to stay the way it was in the main series (Which I always thought was better, maybe because I saw the series before the books)
Look at that throne!!! Amazing ❤️
Will there be anyone from the original cast making an appearance in this ?
Кто от Дантеса?
I still have a bad taste in my mouth from Game of Thrones. Hopefully they don’t fuck this one up
10 seconds in: Bored. 1 minute in: even more bored. After Rheagal and Drogon, and how badly you screwed up the ending of GoT,  you're gonna have a hard time convincing me to watch *checks notes* Dr Who in a wig.
🔥🔥🔥
Is it prequel of got?
hype!
Anyone else upset they can't enjoy this? Thank you final season :( idgaf anymore
YEEEES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS OML
Thrash
how long we have to wait for the dragons this time?
I am happy David Benioff; D. B. Weiss are not involved in the show.
Going to have a good ending this time?
all this lore for bran to be king !!😡
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Will this be more like dune or game of thrones season 8??
I dont care how awful S8 was. I'm watching this to the end
Altrenative title of GOT: we are incent
I thought this was going to be like.... pre-blond Targaryens. Before dragons changed their appearance
HYPERVENTILATING
Remake season 8, and shut the f up
cant wait😍😍😍
no
I'm waiting on YouTubers to stretch this 1 minute  trailer to a 60 minute breakdown.
Nmhhhhh I think not.
I still don't forgive y'all for that last episode of got
Soooo, they shrank the throne over the years? Definitely not something a dynasty would do
Dream didn't make us king dragons did  Thia is the essense of george martin writing
ගැම්මක් තමයි ඉතිම්😏
In fact, Dreams made them kings in the first place.  If Daenys the Dreamer hadn't dreamed of the Doom of Valyria, the Targaryns would have never come to Dragonstone, and later Westeros, and would have died burning with their fellow dragonlord families in Valyria.
Tô surtado com esse teaser 😱😱😱
I wonder if anyone remembers the last season of Game of Thrones?  I wonder when George will come out with Winds of Winter, much less the final book to complete the original series?  I wonder why so many people are willing to forgive HBO for killing their best show five seasons in?
Looks like a bunch of cosplayers at a comic con.
I still have unresolved emotions about D&D messing up this legendary show. 🙆🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Why the doctor's hair are all white,i think he's been trapped in trenzalore for too long.
Am I the only one still burnt out on the Game Of Thrones Universe?
Doesnt make sense to me that they have black Targarians. Just ridiculous that they all have white hair, then vastly different skin colour and faial features. Better they all be black then, this just completely ruins the world building.
HBO max: Releases new season related to GOT Me: Please don't... HBO max: Please don't what? Me: Please don't give me hope.  Nope Im not doing that again
This trailer is already better than season 8
This looks amazing, but it’s going to be so hard to watch knowing Rhaenrya’s fate.
The story of the Targaryen civil war that took place about 300 years before events portrayed in "Game of Thrones."
I hope the story will be phenomenal again like the 1st 2 seasons of Game of Thrones
The biggest selling point of GoT and you DIDN'T give us a quick glimpse of a Dragon???????????????????????????????????? Come on !!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BiaYBvcMAI
Matt Smith: I’m the King of all of Westeros. Basically…run.
This is gonna be awesome 🤩
I don’t understand why this has been made. We know what happened to the past via conversations throughout GOT. Nobody wants to see what happens AFTER GOT? Who gives a shit about what happened before when we all know how it ends anyway? I’m gunna still watch this, but shit man can we get a sequel?
Why is Daenerys Targaryen not in the serie?
The fire will reign
Gerónimo!!!!!
All I want is to read the next god damn book. It's been 10 years now, come on.
Daemon sweetie you were never a king
Definately gave me those GoT vibes I've missed so much.. Lookin good
Give us a remake of season 8 instead!
Dreams did not make us kings, my brother father cousin did.
The Throne 😱😱😱😱
Malayalikal ivide like ❤️❤️❤️❤️👍
just dont let Weiss and Benioff go there and series will be amazing
i had a  faith , still got it
As long as Ramin Djawadi does the score i'm here for it
but we deserve a good ending of GOT ..
I’m so glad HBO canceled the Stark prequel and did this instead.  Targaryens>Starks
Hopefully, you'll do better this time.
Something like games of thrones
So great to see that throne back in action
i just came
Why is everybody adding in the 7th season with the last season when complaining about the GOT ending?! The 7th season was amazing!!! And the 8th season was amazing!! Bunch of whiners. Dani did so many terrible things throughout the whole show. Becoming the “Mad Queen” was inevitable and good writing. Nod to the mad king. And ALL the Stark kids not only survived but came out on top. And they were the true heroes of the show. We just didn’t know that in the beginning. Have an open mind. Season 7 was amazing and 8 was great
Great great great
Makers be like: Let's break the wheels of Shows again.
Даже не знаю хорошо это или плохо...
Aaahh....the eleventh doctor is in this as well ☺️
Live action Re: Zero looking good
Still wishing for purple eyes
2022 will going to be legendary after lock down
So there's black taergeryens now ok pc world
Black Valyrians.  How progressive.
Calling it now episode 1 will open up with a battle beginning or ending!
🎉🎉🎉🥰🥰🥰😎🥰🥰🥰🎉🎉🎉
Please don't be like Season 8 of GoT.
TAMIL FANS 🔥
This mixed in with the new Sopranos movie... Looks like I am going to have to contact the cable company to get HBO again.
It looks like a cashgrab crap
I bet this show ends before winds of winter comes out
Please Hindi dubbed 🙏❤️
Gabagool
So does anybody knows why dragon in coat of arms of House Targaryen with 4 paws? Btw when was GoT made Martin said that is wrong...
Prince Philip in his younger years I see? Where does this fit in the Crown?
Eh
MATT SMITH YESSS
I hope it will heal the wound caused by last season of GOT...!!!!!
This show is like the white walkers.  It's dead and yet still refuses to die.
Do you really expect us to care about this after GoT season 8?
Movie Channels - 10000 things you missed in the Teaser
Sinister sky omega on YouTube
Everything in the trailer is awesome!  Except for the Velarion...
Meh
hmu i’m like 6-7 years when there’s multiple seasons so i can binge it all in one sitting
The era of game of thrones is coming again
Man of dread from Chernigov ?
Goddammit Matt, where and when did the Tardis brought you now?
About time GOT showed some black people. Hopefully this show can correct the awful writings by that dude Martin. Can't believe the only dark skin characters were the orcs. Pretty racist.
Wow! That looks fantastic, so excited, its truly one of the most interesting wars in Westerosi History. I  love how they tried to make the throne closer to the book version. Down with the greens! I can't wait to see the battle above the gods eye!
Aegon the Conqueror will be in this show or not plz reply anyone?
Am I the only one who thinks that the casting and atmosphere in this trailer are... weird?
house valereyon with the seahorse crest with the black characters. they mixed with the targaryen's on the western continent, they where close allies.. im mean valyria is a big continent of course they had black ppl. i mean we saw them on the eastern continent in GOT. well it is an adaptation anyway, they dont have to be strict with source material.
Reign of Targaryen begins🔥
From India ❤
Can't wait 😭😭😭😭😭😭
they have a great solarium! Will there be LGBT-dragons? I want two dragons to love each other dearly and the third wanted to change the gender! ))🐲🐲🐲 will be fantastic!
Күтеміз, HBO🇰🇿
I just bent my knees watching this trailer...
before watching that, in december watch the witcher first then the last kingdoom..🔥🔥🔥
can all of you normies just piss off and let the series die already? it had its 4 seasons of good writing, and knowing Hollywood. House Targaryen is gonna be run by a Strong empowered Black Transgender Mailbox.
Another disappointment
Superb... These will be blockbluster again 😍😍😍😍
I'm so ready for the redemption arc
Well fuck now I have o finish Fire and Blood
Can’t wait to put in years of my life watching this only to be shat on in the last 15 episodes
Ok it’s time to reactivate my HBO plan 🔥🔥👀
Verithanama waiting 🔥 Any tamilans?
I chose my plan : Telegram
Does HBO know GOT is dead?
Espero que seja tão perfeita quanto Game of thrones, e que essa série não tenha um final tão RUIM como GOT
I'm very happy to see another tv-show like game of Thrones, who agree with me 🤩
Here we go again
oh no….here we go again
All hopes on the Special effects team. Good luck guys!🤗
i hope this doesn't become like season 8. last hope for the series
Damn... It looks good but i hate when they go back in time instead of going forward...like wht happened with lord of the rings..... Does not give good vibes
Something just doesn’t feel right about this. Stinks of Uwe Boll.
Oh come on .. wanna see a dragon in trailer
Waiting for Dracarys 🔥🔥🔥
That's one hell of a throne!
Waiting
Emma D'arcy looks AMAZING !!!
I have faith again.
House velaryon looks AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This looks great and seems like it will be closer to the source. Excited!
wtf
Game if thrones left a horabke taste, I don’t want to watch an awesome show, with a lazy last season again!!
After you ruin the GOT ending and bastardized the franchise, leaving a nasty taste in the mouths of many, you think we are gonna be hyped for more? People waited for 8 years for an epic ending to GOT and got nothing. How much nothing have you formulated this time for us HBO?
Omfg can’t wait!
I just creamed in my shorts
Gzuiiiiiis amado!!!!!! Tô morto/ 😱😱😱
They lowkey killed the hype at the last season but we shall see if the show is actually good AND the ending...
Didn't make it in the end Making prequel cause no one cares
So excited for feminist sjw propaganda and bunch of woke cringe gen-z crap
I'm not touching this with a 10 feet pole. After the absolute disapointment, rushed ending and just outright bad Game of thrones was treated, this is simply not worth my time.
Dream did'nt make us king, dragon did🔥🔥 ഇജ്ജാതി 🔥🔥🔥🔥
After the last couple seasons of Game Of Thrones and never getting Winds Of Winter from George…I’m gonna have to skip this. Disenfranchised fan syndrome and all…just can’t support this.
I see Olivia Cooke. I get excited.
wooow I am waiting
Hell yeah! Cant wait to watch it completely free online
I really hope Benioff and Weiss aren't involved
Shall we begin?
"BLACKED"
Ok
That's cool but who has a better story than bran the broken?
Extremely excited for this, just don't have the two writers from the final season of GOT involved and we will be good.
Waiting to see the ancestors of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons. 🔥
Now hopefully you've learnt your lesson with the final seasons of GOT.really looking forward to this
❤️❤️❤️
Wonderful, can't wait to see,fan from india
It doesn't look like game of thrones anymore. I don't like it
മലയാളീസ് ഉണ്ടോ ❤⚡️
Lots of high expectations for this show.  Hope they don't repeat the mistakes of the past.
house valereyon with the seahorse crest with the black characters. they mixed with the targaryen's on the western continent, they where close allies.. im mean valyria is a big continent of course they had black ppl. i mean we saw them on the eastern continent in GOT. well it is an adaptation anyway, they dont have to be strict with source material.
Spoiler: Robert Baratheon kill Rhaegar Targaryen
There should be a young version of lady melissandre...? Wink.. wink..
Looks like D&D cosplay..... Get it? Huh? Huh? God damn that's clever.
Well fuck here's my $$$$ hbo max
Who is the voice? Someone tell me... cuz i can't stop imagining Joseph Morgan 😅😅😅😅
If you're listening me, dubbed in Hindi Too...
Am so bloody in
Still better than Witcher and Amazon LOTR
They should have redone Season 8 before focusing on a bloody prequel. No interest whatsoever in watching another GoT show after the incompetence shown by directors and writers.
200 years? Melisandre get ready girl :D
All we wanted was a prequel series about Roberts rebellion instead we are 200 years in the past even when Thrones fans get what they want HBO still fuck's us over, unless they are gonna be doing time skips and shit like that and if so then wtf is the point in showing characters and plot lines that are just going to be abandoned after a couple seasons.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THATS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRESSING 'LIKE'!  YES!! YES!!! WOW!! It cannot come quick enough. Looks amazing! Desperate to see the dragons but let's keep that for Ep1 when they blow us away! 😁❤
My god
No doubt cinematography will flawless. However this has some pretty big shoes to fill
Is that Richard maddens (Rob Stark) Voice running in the background...?Any way, I hope the intro theme of "House of the dragon" would be as lit and as GOT intro theme.......
Are we gonna see a house completely wiped out?
The iron thrones looks like it is in the books.... 🔥
Е**ть ребят дождались
Full hype
Finally. Can't wait.
"I'm a Dragon now, Dragons are cool"
Omg waiting so much to see the dragons!!!
Here's hoping GOT's showrunners have nothing to do with this. They burned the bridge as they stood on it in GOT S7+S8 and many will be wary of this being just as weak.
Can u please remake the s8? 😭
Dracarys💥
I didn't see a single dragon in this trailer.  Only a statute face of one
Hopefully this can make up for dumb and dumbers failure ending
The iron throne looks accurate.... 💯
If you are smart, if you value your existance, if you have any plans of seeing tomorrow there is one thing you never ever put in a trap.
I love danerys , i love this , i love targaryen
Hope you'll not screw-up House of the Dragon like you did it to the Game of the Thrones.
0:24 holy shit this is the first time we're seeing blackfyre isn't it?
Bring HBO max to India soon!! 😤
no thanks y’all fucked up horrendously and I doubt this’ll even start to make up for the absolute shitting-the-bed awfulness of S8
Hopefully the last season of this isn't absolute trash..
so in 200 years the technology didn't advance at all? cool...
Puta que pariu que teaser , ansiosa 😱
BALERION🔥
What's up with the four-legged dragons in the Targaryen sigil? Pretty sure dragons only have two legs + wings in the show canon?
What the heck is happening with George R R Martin's last books for A Song of Ice and Fire?
Looking forward to this 😎
Ah. What? Dreams did make you kings. Without dreams the targarians would have burned up in the Doom with the rest of the Dragon lords.
Woahhh...
Visually I find it very interesting ... I hope the history and its development are too.
We are waiting 🔥🔥❤️
Everyone: lol, all dragons dead lmao  Cannibal and Morning: *sad dragon noises*  Meanwhile Silverwing: *continues crying over Vermithor's dead body*
WINTER IS COMING ❄️
The Throne!! The Throne!!! Hahaha YESS!! Changing It to be more book acurate gives me hope🙏
Can anyone tell  Will there be white walkers in this show ?
Literally hyperventilating
🔥🔥🔥
Meh. It's hard to care about this franchise any longer.
Ennada release
i wish I could have plan, HBO Max when will you launch it in India?
Is Alicent holding the catspaw dagger
Freak Yes!!! 🐉
If the writing is as good as seasons 1-5 of GoT, I’ll watch it.
Let's goooooooo
If you faced breaking bad vs game of thrones.  Then be ready for better call saul vs house of the dragons.
They really think people are gonna line up after the shit show of an ending that they gave us.
A fat Targaryan king and no purple eyes - again!? A the iron throne already in the teaser?
എന്റമ്മോ പൊളി സാനം 😎🤩🤩
And some how Corlys is not the Aryan sensation uniting the generations
Let's just hope that they don't screw it up like they did with the last season of got
Fuck it looks good
Dream doesn't make us king  Dragon did 🔥🔥🔥
😍🔥
it looks like a netflix teen show
aye the throne looked a little more like from the books i want it
As long as dumb and dumber aren't involved in this one...
Idc abt the Show. Literally getting Goosebumps  listening to this tune after such a long time.😇😇
Oh my god oh my God oh my GODDDDDJAUSKSUKSSSSE
I wanna see the dragon's
So, is this canon to the show or the book?
Hoping they will not make it like season 8... Any way enjoy GOT cover on flute here : https://youtu.be/6LvDxraYqcA
That one shot of the dragon in front of the torches has to be Balerion right?
Yessssssss! Also, I hope this is nothing like season 8 of GOT.
Everyone talking shit about this because   season 8 was shit but i bet everyone will watch it nonetheless lmaoo
Eu uso mascara, álcool e gel, mantenho distanciamento social só pra poder assitir saporra em 2022😎
Brasil 2021
Spoiler Alert: Game of thrones...
Can't wait for an insanely good first season, then a couple of great ones, ending with a rushed piece of trash.
Never again. Got too invested last time and I am not interested in wasting my time again.  FU HBO.
I thought it was cancelled?
Aegon??? Helaena??? Aemond?? I see the blacks, but the greens???
Remember the last season of GOT? This would it be like.
Ah finally
All this to ended up in that sh*t!
Where is my dragon queen ❤❤❤❤
💜 From INDIA
Why the dragon on targaryen crest got 4 paws
Wowww, my excitement is above the roof now. This trailer seriously came as a surprise,  absolutely beautiful, looking forward to House of Dragons.
We want tamil dub
It's time to get in the real dragon world 💥💥
dislikes should be higher after what they did to the final season of got
gowno to bedzie es
hopefully this won't turn out to have the crappiest ending like HoT!
Fuck you HBO fix the last season of GoT!!!
0:23 IS THIS BLACK FIRE SWORD
🐍0🐍🐍
Black Targarin 😀! ахахах
Waiting 🤧
Seems cool but Velaryion's look is awful
Looks woke.... 🥴
Hbo better not screw this up
Dracarys.
corlys valerion looking like Leroy Smith....
HBO Max presents: Another 7 years of exciting thrilling drama filled action!, and another final season of anti climatic garbage. *cough*
An HBO…
Would have been great if GoT had remained great.  Perhaps in the future some dude or dudess who knows how to pull off a good story can re-edit, re-shoot, deepfake and thus remake the original into something great.
Let the incest begin!
Weak trailer
Now that’s a Throne made from a thousand blades of Aegons enemies. The Game of Thrones begins again. Let’s f@#king gooooooo
Lol black targaryen ? How far has woke ness come 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Valar Morghulis
Prior to GOT final season I was pumped for this prequel series, now not so much.
lmao they HAD to put some black guys with blonde dreads
Cant wait to see the dr who guy. Never knew he was in this
I’m waiting on the scene where someone asks Matt Smith “Are you a doctor?” …. “No I’m The Doctor “
Vanam 🤡
New season of doctor who looks good
"Dreams didn't make us kings."  Daenys the Dreamer: "Hey fuck you too buddy."
can't wait to see the ending of this series too :)
Please dont fuck this up either
Yes yes and yes 🐉🔥
Let’s hope this ends better than the last attempt.
Omg omg omg I woke up to this
Not to happy about the cast, but if this fails at least we get new LOTR series coming, hope one of those won't disappoint.
GOT fans assemble !!!!!
Everything looks so much better!!!!
Going to be hot steaming dogshit
Fuck this. Where's Rome season 3?
oh boy
Please only 5 seasons , after that u r just ruin it (its a request)
It's not even comfortable to sit on it anyways
been waiting for thisss for sooo longggggggg im dyiinggggggg........................
So many Targaryen around and in the end, there were only 4 kids that survived.
Don't disappoint us again .🙇🙇🙇🙇
Still can’t believe my dream came true!!!😭❤️ my favorite House 🐉🔥
Just couldn't do that without blackwashing, huh?... Watch this sh.t yourself.
oh yeah black Targaryens, classic.
It's amazing how much a horrible last season and finale can ruin my interest in something. smh
O trono cheio de espadaaaa aaaajjjhhj
വെയ്റ്റിംഗ് 🔥
So glad the cast is finally more diverse!
I just ask... Is it the remaining of gamo of thrones... Is ot the past....? Please tell anyone.... In cool words.... I am not much learned english... 🤗
Words cannot describe just how ridiculous "Corlys Velaryon" looks..... My God, anything for the sake of diversity right 🥴 Cause they couldn't take a litany of minor-white characters and made them black *like they did multiple times in the show with Salladhor San/others and it wasn't a problem-at all*
My biggest issue with Games of Thrones universe was that having dragons affiliated and useable by one kingdom was totally unfair. There should have been other mythical beasts of equivalent grandeur and power available to other kingdoms.
Finally the iron throne as it is described 💯💯
Looks kind of garbage, not gonna lie. Also, really don‘t like the casting of the main character
That Iron Throne is a metaphore of what this show wants to be.
Also release in. Hindi this show
Pls release this soon
"House of the Dragon"  Shows no dragon
Anyone else notice Aryas Catspaw Dagger at 0.40?
Can't wait
finally!!
Where are the dragons..?
OLIVIA COOKE ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?????
Laughs in High Valyrian
😍😍😍
No thanks. GoT is dead for me after the last season
I had exactly 2 reactions after watching this.  1) they can't mess up the ending because it's not like they're gonna run out of books this time And 2) omg the doctor
Wow ❤️ ❤️
Yes, Matt Smith!
lets not mess up the ending of this one please....
I thought this was Wheel of time teaser again lol
I'm easy. I see Matt Smith and I click.
Meh.
We wuz targaeryans n shiiet
Is their mother of dragon
🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥
Targaryens! Is this going to be a whole show about incest and orgies within a family now? Jaime and Cerci were hard enough to watch for God(s) sake...#leaveouttheincest
I think it's end is in 2030😂
I just woke up it’s 9:13 in the morning and my morning just started off amazing
Nem posso acreditar que vou ver essa maravilha😀😍🥰
0:38-0:39 whos that? Don't tell me Targaryen.
Not even 1 dragon?
will there be dragons in this show?
Energetically waiting ❤️
putaaaaaa queee pariuuu
Ohh ye guys
Let’s hope they don’t screw this up too, loved most of GoT but not the ending. Aegon will be awesome to see in film finally
Let's hope holding the door was worth for this.
flop
Cant wait for south parks “house of bofa”
probably gonna suck like season 8 jk
Hodor
Come GOT make another season before I get tired of dragons. Oh wait, I already am.
Matt looks hella sick
2022 will be ruled by  dragons 🐲
I wonder who's gonna betray who?!
Doctor Who fans where u at??
I'm so sorry I busted out laughing at matt smith in that wig lol
They had my interest, but now they have my attention. I also really like that they changed some things in the throne room as well as the iron throne itself, the throne now looks a bit more like how it’s described in the books, not as big but more accurate. I don’t want them to stick to the source material verbatim, but I wouldn’t be mad this time around if they did because this story is absolutely bananas.
Here we go again
Fire can't kill dragon
Yes please.
Hellooooo Matt Smith
Black Targaryen 😤
LETS GOOOO
Waiting
Can’t wait.
Not sure about the castings....only time will tell. Anyways I hope there is more of the magic side of it in D.O.D
I'm not buzzing..this feels like a cheap knock off of thrones..like a cash cow
Looks aight
First for Stannis the true King of Westeros
Hopefully this ending won’t be as bad at GoT
ohh im looking forward to bunch of dragons eating and killing people... AMEN
🥰🥰🥰
The old iron Throne looked better
Maybe overhyped!!!
Interesting but this teaser really needed a shot of a dragon... Fortunately D&D are gone but honestly I don't really trust the new show runners looking at what they did before.
A couple of years later and still everything GoT related is like salt in the wound.
Please make me forget about season 8
Aaaaaaa....i am gonna dieeee😍
It would be almost good if Corlis Velaryon were performed by a suitable actor for his role as a Velaryon…
OMG I am so happy right now.
After what happened to GOT, so not planning to invest my time with this.
OMG ansioso estou!!
Hype hyoe hype 🔥🔥🔥
As long as those 2 pretentious morons aren't on this project, I'm willing to give it a shot! I already like the casting, looking forward to it!
Giant who cares...?
HBO is trying to break our hearts again.
fuck yeh!
Finally 😭😭 my dream come true 😭😭
What book is this based on? There's so many now 🥵
I don’t even remember seasons 5-8 anymore! Give me this now!!!
This is something.
யாதும் ஊரே யாவரும் கேளிர்...👍
This looks so good i can not wait for it.
🥛🐮
Uh Prince Phillip, what are you doing?
This looks cool...but what I really want is for GRRM to finish Winds of Winter 😥
We can just hope that this one is not the last, i wanna watch about the first men and how the night guard was made, that would be really awesome
If you read the book you already know this is gonna be good.
How many days till 2022🥲
Can't wait for this show. But still - my dear HBO, how could you be so stupid for letting Dumb & Dumber to destroy GoT in the four last seasons ??!? I hope you were wiser now. Anyway, D&D are off - so you have my attention with this.
Sheeeeesh, now that was FIRE.
I really don’t like white haired mat smith it just looks so dumb
Hype train activated.
I Can't wait anymore
I may watch it but at the same for me at least what's the point knowing how they ended GOT
You gotta love prince philips look in the next season of "the crown".
Lol... Black Valyrians. The show is already trash.
LITERAL CHILLS
Happy to have Matt smith back on my screen !!
mah
Oh my God! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woow
Sad reality is  in last Robert  braithian will be on throne . And legacy will be washed
Looking forward to looking this show 😊😊
Noice another dark fantasy to watch along with lotr series.
You know what i'm truly hyped for. The hour of the wolf.
LEZZZZGOOOOOO
Fire will Reign
Can't wait
Watching this makes me want another round of Game of thrones.
Once again, Matt Smith stands besides a Queen.
Hell ya!
Fuck D&D, god-damned hacks
Well thank you HBO Max I wasn’t looking for this but I’ll definitely take it.
The ending will still be shitty.. So it doesnt matter how good this is
I'm gonna be honest, I'm not really excited for this, but when I saw that more book accurate Iron Throne *chef's kiss*
better not cheap out on those dragons cgi
Whare is HBOmax in india ,😭😭😭
0:43 green banners of House Tarly, Sam's family.
Here we go again... Am ready to get hurt again 😂😂😂😂😂
hoping for another epic tv show
Can't wait 🔥
You remember ramsy bolton right
I know the soundtrack will be amazing. Ramin Djawadi never fell us
:)
I don't know.
Only 200 years before? Will there be dragons?
Please bring Jon snow’s adventures back
Battles need to be on point!!!!
“Everytime a targeryon is born,the gods flips a coin and whole world holds its breath” “Lord” verys “the spider”
Don't do that don't give me hope
Beat House!!!!
Meh!
Just be good
Robb Stark 👍👍👍👍
Теоретики, какова вероятность наличия в Вестеросе чернокожих Веларионов?
So the Velaryons are black.... sweet interesting twist
It's a different team behind this right? Then I say let them have a shot.
Je parie 10 euro, qu'ils vont le gâcher comme la saison 8, bof :(.
At least we know how the end of this story will be
Please release this in hindi language also
The costumes here are so much better than GOT
People are so gullible falling for this show again smh 🤦‍♂️
The saga continues 😀
Malayalis🥰💥
HBO showed they don’t know how to do A song of Fire and Ice without a book to follow…. it’ll be shit
I guess we would expect a mass dragon battles maybe in 2027
Black targaryen? Honestly?
House of Kangz
They'll ruin this one just the same as they did GoT.
I hope they will not fuck it up like last time
if no D&D than its worth watching, was hoping for a real season 8 of GoT but i guess starting a completely new seaosn will do it for now
🔥🔥🔥
OMG it looks so good. Can't wait!
STILL waiting for Winds of Winter
Gods, Kings, Fire.. and blonde
should just remake season 7 and 8 before putting out new stuff.
Charaters wearing helmets during combat!? Woahhhh
I've been looking forward to this...
Mother father and lord I hope I sleep tonight and wake up in 2022
Will that be in Canada also?
I’m so ready!!!
Daqui a há 6 anos vou me lembrar que eu comecei a assistir essa maravilha
After seeing the targaryen armour ,now i want to see how robert baratheon crushed it.....
I just wanted to see one thing... Fucking Balerion alive and now my dreams are gone, i mean that bitch is the biggest dragon i want at least a flashback on him
I like it!! Cant wait
Too soon.  We haven't forgotten what those D&D writers destroyed.  Rushed it all.  It wasn't even what happened.....it was the rushed way it got there.   I realise HBO tried to get more episodes......but they should have put their foot down and stopped them rushing and ruining what could have been the greatest TV show in decades. Now it's memory just leaves a sour taste in our mouths.  I lack the faith to invest more years into this.  Sorry.
Who can know the heart of a dragon?
😲😲😲
Watching it on repeat since it came out
Game of Trhones "era LA serie" pero le dieron el peor final imaginado jamás, terminó siendo una historia decepcionante, de esas que se venían cuidando, amando, pero que terminaste desechando y tirando a la basura porque así....por un final, la terminaste considerando una basura. A la gran mayoría, GOT decepcionó mucho. Ver tanta producción en una historia precuela de aquella tan horrible es como..... todo termina con Daenerys tirana (liberadora de esclavos = tirana, suponían que tanto poder no centraría todas las decisiones en ella = tiranía) Bran el cuervo de 3 ojos (un tipo auto proclamado dios para el resto que lo ve de esa forma o no = soberano justo, un muchacho cuya palabra es la única porque todo lo ve y sabe = no es tirano sino sabio. Mando a su hermano legitimo heredero al ostracismo del muro como castigo de.... un condenado lo proclama rey y los otros reyes lo aceptan como tal, este dice todos serán parte de mi reino menos el de mi familia y todos los que condenaron a la tirana lo aceptan) La tirana real Cercei muere acompañada de amor y Daenerys que dio su vida por los demás muere traicionada por su amor. Todo lo anterior es para llegar a esa historia nefasta pro status quo establecido. Esa misma producción, ese mismo amor en un producto, en una historia buena que no se distorsione a la fuerza sería el ideal, o deberían anunciar que es un cambio de rumbo, que aceptan el error cometido y empezaran de cero esperando a que se terminen los libros al llegar a ese punto y volver a contar, pero bien, aquella historia con nuevo reparto.
Finally i was waiting so patiently for this...
I wanna see house Baratheon 🦌
Back in kingslanding, yeah
When I hear the Targaryen theme, season 8 flashed inside me and I don't know why ..but this will be surely epic
CGI dragons didn't make a bad show, horrible writing did.
I am very hopeful for this BUT …. WHAT IF…. It’s become like gossip girl reboot…  I know I know this is completely different from gg genre but what if…. Because I love got a lot… a lot a lot …. I don t wanna be upset… I’m scared as well as excited…. Let’s see… finger crossed… love you GOT ❤️
Dragons did.....
House of the dragon   Better writers and directors  Better layout and has a clear ending  Better CGI and 17+ dragons
Mad king 🔥
So Targaryens are black now suddenly? I cant stop laughing.
Disappointment on the way ✨✨
So many youtubers are going to be turning a 60 second trailer into a 30 min video right now.
Can anyone give me surety about this series...that if i give my precious time to this..like i gave to GOT....then in the end it will not going to ruin my time...PRECIOUS TIME.
Is that Narrator is Ramsay ?
Let's get to it!    🔥🔥🔥
I thought this was about Bruce Lee, utterly disappointed.
hóng
LETSGOOOOOOO!!!!!
Wait, is Jaehaerys I Targaryen in this show? Because I literally chose my english name as Jaehaerys
Skinny doctor who to be a dragon king worrior...???! 😳
I've been reading this book. Cannot fucking wait.
black targarian 🤣🤣🤣🤣 idiot tolerant logic
Matt smith is a garbage actor, he totally ruined doctor who
FUCK YEA!!!!!!
" A dragon is not a slave.  They were terrifying, extraordinary, they filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them in here. Then they wasted away, they grew small, and we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them, we were like just everyone else."   Daenerys Targaryen
Anyone else get goosebumps??? Ahh I’m so excited
why did they give the dragons four legs?
NO SHOW ME A DRAGON NOW!
Iam waiting 😍
❤
Where the dragons at? Bring out the dragons let's burn some shit up!🕺🏾🕺🏾💃💃
Damn the throne looking way better
When you realize we will probably see Vhagar.
🔥👀
Interesting take on House Velaryon.
I like the new throne, it is closer to the descroptions in the books.
The fucked up Season 8 of GoT so bad...I'm not invested in anything GoT related anymore.
remake season 7 & 8 at least as anime
Malayalies evidee 👍like
FIRE WILL REIGN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How about a remake of the last season of GoT? xD
nice trailer. may this redeem the previous
Loveit🥰
GAME OF THRONES IS BACK!
they spent so much on the dragons that they forgot to leave anything for the wigs 😭
Can't wait to see daemon Targaryen 😍 ,the author's fav character 💙
The Witcher's new trailer looks dope as fuck!!!
Cant wait to witness this magnum opus🔥🔥😍😍....  DRACARYS🔥🐲
looks shit sorry
💥💥
Can’t wait to see Balerion
Already better than the last three episodes of Thrones…
Vera💥mari🔥
I don't feel teased at all.
Jontron: “You did this to me, Matt Smith. YOU DID THIS TO MEEE!!!”
wow
This will be my most favorite PORN of 2022! I'm looking forward to it!
മലയാളി  എവിടെ?
With fire and blood....
Thought they were going for the OG Big Throne there, but nah, just a few decorative floor swords, for a laugh.
"GRRM didn't kill GOT,  D&D did "
Lesgoooooooo
Arya stark and John snow 🔥 fan
I feel like I have commitment and trust issues with GOT
i heard the other GOT spinoff was cancelled due to woke pandering: while i am sad for the wasted series, its better then going down the star wars route, it was worth waiting for house of the dragon, until now it looks like a faithful adaption and not a "modern" interpretation of Martins vision
Eagrly waiting for the new things
IM SO EXCITED
I just need to know; are Dumb & Dumber involved in this?
The final season of GoT sucked ass.
Summer is coming
Man that soundtrack alone made me hyped for this
Ooh i liked the teaser. Though theres something about casting matt smith   as daemon that just  doesnt gel for me
Finally some black people!
*_Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did_*  Chills to the bone 🐉 🐲🔥
I don't know guys, I'm still not entirely over the disappointment. It was a high fall off the horse.
What's the point when we know it ends shit!
Fire will reign 💥⚡😘
As excited as I want to be for this, their will always be a sour taste in my mouth. No matter how good this is, it will eventually lead to Game of Thrones and that will lead up to a meaningless and terrible ending.
At least they don't have to wait around hoping GRRM will finish the story this time around
I don't want to care..... but I think I do.
Well Targaryens are coming after death of my favorite Targaryen 💔
I came here for Matt Smith
Is this Rob voice over?
Hyyyyped 😍
This better be good. D&D destroyed my ability to see anything related to GoT
Valar morghulis ❤️
Excellent cast. Simply the best!
We are waiting എവിടെ മലയാളീസ്
After that debacle end of GOT, This one better be as good as it looks.
Here it comes after a long wait
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE VELARYONS ACTORS
House Targaryen for life!!!
Dragons with saddles! PLEASE! It was pathetic to see Daenerys flying without saddles.. 😢
Black valyrian 🤦😂😂😂👌 Fck HBO
STILL not interested
They better not let feminism and their failed woke message ruin this one too
I’m down for some GoT redemption
Love From India👌👌👌👌
❤️waiting
Just waiting g for Charlie now. Need a breakdown
Matt Smith... SOLD
Looking forward to having another addiction for approximately 10 years....
Sigh. Was sucked back in almost immediately
Well let's hope these protagonists don't hey tooo attached to their dragons and end up saying "it's muh dragun"
മലയാളികൾ ഇവിടെ വരും....എനിക്ക് ഉറപ്പാ❤🔥
Good luck team #houseofdragon .
It's interesting to see that they're proclaiming it as "HBO Original Series" but in the end, they only say "coming to HBO Max in 2022".  And no mention if it's gonna air on Cable HBO
Good to see you back my beloved iron throne
i have read the books and get ready for some thrill....hod is comming 🔥
Ah shit, here we go again.
മലയാളീസ് കടന്ന് വരൂ ❤
it would seem that all Valyrians have white skin and violet eyes ...
❤️❤️❤️
they gonna fuck it up in the end... i have a feeling.
OMGGGGGGGGGGG!!!! i just came across this trailer & I am wearing my fav House Targaryen Fire and blood t-shirt... ❤️
Sure it looks good now, but is the ending going to suck?
Well, at least they added more swords to the Throne, it's a start.
Going into this with little, too no expectations after the monstrosity of season 8 GoT.. we all saw what happens when they differ too much from the source material and try to make up their own stories.. that being said, D & D have nothing to do with this so I’m game.
Yeah, no thanks. After GoT's Season 6 ended up being so uneven in the witting and story department and Season 7 being such a rush job, I don't see why anyone would care for this series again.   Not to mention the fact that HBO cancelled the main show before Season 8 could even happen...Such a shame.
Over but legend ❤️
Would have liked to see a few dragons..
OMG  aaaaaaah! 😍🔥🐉
Not going to watch this. I do not feel like investing my time just so they can F up the ending.
I'm sorry but why the hell is the Sea Snake BLACK? Is it so difficult for people to respect the lore. Valyrians are homogenous ethnic group. They should all look like the Targaryans. Not watching, so sick of this crap.
still cannot forgive them for the messed up way they ended G.O.T.... hope they do this one better
At least its the original teaser, not some cartoon story clickbait.
Dr.Targaryen
#OMG
Black Valyrians,  politically correct because they have violet or deep blue eyes
The only reason that this show was made was because John Oliver demanded more of that sweet sweet dragon money from HBO.
Fire will regain bro..............
So excited!!!!
WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS!!?
please release in hindi dubbed For Indian fans  🥰🥰
Damn I’m actually excited ngl 🔥
D&D after watching this: Sobbing under Wierwood tree.
Bruuuuuh the THRONEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Will sane people trust you again after Game of Thrones?
Knowing how it all ends, I'm not at all excited to see it. And look, black token targaryens, how nice..
ЭТО ТОП! НАКОНЕЦ-ТО ХОТЬ ЧТО-ТО ГОДНОЕ ВЫЙДЕТ!
Puissant
Meu deus 😍
"Dreams didn't make us king's, Dragons did"  I bet in history of Dragon, they is no dragon stronger than Drogon
Can't wait 😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
like anyone is gonna be fair to this show lol
Winter has come
Am I gonna let HBO play with my heart again? Yes!
I can't more wait for this series and game of thrones👑 my favorite all time
😍😍😍
As a handsome black man myself with long locks. I sure hope the black guy with bleached locks is a main character!! Looks mf awesome!
Muy malo este trailer. Malísimo.
whats with the black people in this? there's no black targaereans
IS THAT MATT SMITH!??
don't fuck up this final!!!!
Justice for Daenerys Targaryan the true Dragon Queen
Isso foi o motivo do meu colapso
OMG its happening  Stay calm everyone   Stay fucking calm
Game of Thrones turned into a Dragon Show in the last 2 Seasons. I hope this is again about good Dialogues and well written Characters that behave like their Nature.
Seems doctor who got lost again.
Has Matt Smith. Will watch.
The Hound 200yrs in future : F*** the King.
HBO : You won't find Lanisters in this. Fans : Fine I'll do it myself
Waiting! 🇱🇰 SL GOT Fans ✌️
Oh my god can't wait for it!
I didn't know Matt Smith is in this!!!! I'm definitely watching 🔥🔥🔥
متى يعرض ؟!!
HBO: Want to see a GOT show D&D didn't write?  Me: *Why do you think I came all this way?*
I hope it hooks me again.   It will be difficult to forget that this all leads to idiocy in 200 years... but.   We'll see.
🔥🔥🔥
I guess no purple eye contacts, again😐(I was especially hype for them when I saw Yennefer on The Witcher with them)
All of this for Bran the broken to end up on the throne. Man GOT season 8 will always leave a sour taste. Although this looks good, and hopefully it delivers.
Matt Smith really gave me the chills with the white Targaryen hair
Please just tell me you're not letting D&D nowhere near this and I'm in
let us enjoy it for a while, but then ruin it completely as it comes to a close, will probably watch it
Best be in 4k Dolby Vision with Dolby Atmos. HBO needs to get with the times
currently bleaching my hair
The Witcher crossover  Imagine lol
This one🔥
Does anyone have faith in this after they butchered the first series?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg 😱 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Almost all of the dragons die Deamon dies
can we have like 15 episodes at least a season please
No point. We know all the prophecies that they focused on came to fucking nothing. Jon Snow was pointless. And boring bran became king. Just let game of thrones die. D&D ruined it. Also this casting looks terrible!
Can't wait to enjoy this show for 8 years just for the writers to take a massive shit on the script for the final sesson!
i am still in therapy because of season 8 of GoT.....
This better be good!
Nope, fool me once shame on you fool me twice. . . You are not gonna fool me twice
*All this history for Bran to be king in the end*
If GRRM didn't write it... I'm not into it. Pass.
blacksheep xDDDDDD
Shentee mone.. Power⚡⚡
I will miss Dany 😔
from the looks of it they already outdid even last seasons of GOT in terms of costume designs....fingers crossed !   that Targaryen dk armor though ! :)
DIOS MÍO QUE EMOCIÓN
Waiting🔥😍
Whennnn?????
OK...ANYWAY
THIS IS IT
Well, time to read Fire & Blood. Can’t wait!
Pass
Now bring Dany back to life and we'll forgive you for letting D&D ruin the show
Yes
Don’t screw this up please.
I really hope they dont fuck this up like they did the last season of GOT.
Dreams didn't make us King... Dragons did🤩🔥Waiting for the House of Targaryens🐲. ഇതും നോക്കി വന്ന മലയാളീസ് ഇവിടെ ലൈക്‌ അടിച്ചിട്ട് പോ😂🤙🏼
After GOT season 8 i will wait until last season ends. I don't have nerves for another GOT disaster.
We get this... but not Winds of Winter..!! 😞
So we’re just supposed to forgot how badly they f#%ked GOT season 8?
Finally
Fire 🔥🔥
*Dreams didn't make us kings, DRAGONS DID*  🔥
NEXT SPIN OFF PLS BE ROBERTS REBELLION!
They've done it again!  I was into it all for the dragons since GOT started and they even threw in white walkers for the extra fun...now this, Yesss!
People who said they aren’t watching knows this looks amazing
YYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is that the 11th doctor?
Damn, didn’t know the Doctor was an actor too.
Damn you HBO! I will not watch this. You ruined all things Song of Ice and Fire related by allowing those two fools to destroy Game of Thrones.
Matt smith as Daemon Targaryen, eh
Щоб не просрали, як кінцівку першого серіалу.
😻😻🔥
So exciting
Is that ramsay bolton's voice ? 😮
Can’t wait😍
Lame
It's sad because this show will most likely be cool and we already know how crap it all ends.
Let's hope the writer is GRRM
OMFG! I'm screaming with teary eyes. 2022 come soon please.
dude can't wait!!!!!!
YASSSSSSS
Ya la quiero ver joder!!!!!
not gonna waste my time anymore with this shit...
Black velaryon?? Wtf! It's specifically mentioned as the main trait as being white colored with silver hair.
Sigh. I'm open to watching a good show in this franchise, divorced from the mistakes of the main series.
Aaaaaa I'm crying  😭😭😭😭😭 i love you  HBO
HBO max please dubbed House of dragons in Hindi  Dubbing ke liye comments kare
മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ 🔥❤️
Yeeeeeeee!!!!!!!
“Hold on…I don’t think we have enough swords on the throne.” - writers probably
Espero y está serie esa como las primeras temporadas de GOT y no una decepción como el final 🤞🤞🤞
Take your time and end it with GRRM's advice!
GODDAMMIT
I was ready to trash this trailer, much like the writers trashed season 7 and 8 of GOT, but then I saw Matt Smith.  Ok, I am in.
Those Valryians got really lucky though shepards of sheeps then they become dragon noble riders
For the dragons sake
Finally 🔥😱😱
The final season of GoT = Great ideas and a brilliant ending marred by (mostly) terrible execution. I’m mostly just looking forward to GRRM finally finishing the series and seeing the ending done properly. I hope he doesn’t allow backlash to alter his intentions. It’d be heartbreaking and unfair, to him and to his fan base. That being said, I’ll still give the show a chance and I hope everyone else does as well.
Cómo es que este trono de hierro si se parece a el de los libros con todas esas espadas y el de la serie no?? Que paso con todas esas espadas en esos 200 años?
If the woke have touched this, it'll be shit.
I pray for better ending ! 🙏 thoughts and prayers
Okay let's hope HBO doesn't fuck this up like season 8 of GoT cause that was the biggest cockblock ever.
I'm so excited! Was that the Iron Throne? Looks more accurate than GOT's.
YESS, I was hyped for this before before but I’m ten times more hyped after seeing my boy the hidden gem Matt freaking Smith!
Looks awful. At least you managed to put in world breaking valerian POC cosplayers.
Eagerly waiting 🔥💯❤️
am i going to invested in this show like i was with GOT and then get a stupid ending?
മലയാളീസ് ഉണ്ടോ 👋
Don't forget, this all ends with Bran the broken lmao
Believe it or not I was Having a Solem Morning until  I seen this.....im actually Kinda Happy now lol  7.34 am Texas,USA  October 5th 2021
കട്ട വെയ്റ്റിങ് 😍😍😍
can’t waitttt
The Iron Throne looks terrifying and magnificant! Awesome trailer. 😁
Qual a data ? Não vejo a hora
Hey how about fixing 7 & 8 before shoving another product at us. This is America. We need a few remakes, retcons, reimagines, and prequel sequels to a prequel before you start this shit.
roarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Tabahi❣️
Pass.
Why does this look like a B-movie....
Lol knowing how the show’s story ended makes this less interesting… but that’s just how I’ve always felt about prequels… when the original story ended like garbage, why would I want to see this? Meh 😑
I'm the mother if dragons!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm still recovering from season 8
Black blonde Targariens 🤦🤦🤣🤣
Looking forward to another epic. Can't wait
this trailer brings back memories 😭😭😭
So the iron throne got an update
My heart stopped beating for few seconds 🖤🖤🖤
got 🔥🔥fans who are waiting for this hit alike here
Am I going to get cat fished?
Well, this'll be interesting 😁🐉🔥
Shit 2022 just got better.
pls don't suck :(
Shall we begin..... 🐉
Rubbish mate
can we see valyria in this show
Black Valyrian
eagerly waitinf for it
just WOW
Absolutely can’t wait for this! Prequels rarely hold interest for me but this is a story I’ve always wanted and all I can say is...The sooner the better...Lets do this!
Is it available in Hotstar?
absolute goosebumps moment at the ending...
Waiting for all the ASOIAF YouTubers to wake up so we can watch Fan out all day over this Shii!!
is the final season gonna suck?
yall couldn't afford the cgi dragons for the promo??
Game of thrones 🔥🔥🔥
0:18 🔥
They should have put 200 yrs before Roberts' rebellion
If you ruined this HBO I swear to god you will be punished 🤬
“Thousand blades of Aegons enemies” Now that’s a fucking throne!! I can’t wait!!
Gods. Kings. Fire. Blood. Time Lord.
Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did 🔥🔥❣️
💜🔥
REMAKE SEASON 7 AND 8.
I don't care bout what happened to season 8, but hopefully this will restore my faith in humanity😂
CARALHO O QUE É ISSO? PODE VIR QUE EU TO PRONTO
Paa dam dhisoom...!
is HOD release in Hindi
I'm disappointed with the lead actor. He looks nothing like the handsome warrior mentioned in the book. In fact, he looks like a human lizard!
Yoooooo they made my man Corlys Velaryon black 💀
Dreams didn't make us kings... actually, George RR Martin's dreams made us kings
NOT THIS SHIT AGAIN.
Not to be an asshole, but isn't the House Targaryen sigil dragon only supposed to have two legs, not four? Other than that the trailer looks awesome.
The ending of GOT was so bad ... we don't even share any more memes ...
It's going to be so hard to get reinvested in this world after the shit D&D pulled in 2019. It's been years and I'm still mad.
Please HBO I'm begging you,don't ruin this.
The change of the iron throne is appreciated (it is more faithful to the one represented in The word of Asoiaf), although it is a bit incoherent with respect to what was shown in the adaptation of the main saga. On the other hand, the Velaryons are absolutely disappointing.
Looking forward to this🤞🤞🤞
remember that they failed to do a good thing when the job was 80% done.
What are they hiding in the video so dark? 😩
Ufffffffff 😻🔥
GASP.... No... Can this be?  👁️👄👁️
Finally.......... Can't wait
Let’s goooooooo🔥🔥🔥😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌
Omg😱
Hope yall ain't gonna mess it up
Waiting for 2022 to arrive....house of the dragons❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💥💥...got💥💥💥💪💪
I CAN'T WAIT
YYYEEEESSSSSSS    HBO Max     YYYYEEESSSSSS
Yessssss
Gods ... Kings ... Fire ... and... Blood .... AND ... Nudity? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
https://youtu.be/dQjamUNQh88
Not looking forward to the 'blood and cheese' but I do hope they get some new characters to ride cannibal and grey ghost, who got wasted in the books imho.
This trailer is at least a million times better than the entire season 8 of GoT Is that very good or very sad?    Spoiler: It is very sad
OMG I AM SO EXCITED TO WATCH IT,LOOKNG FORWARD TO IT!!!!!
I thought I was done with GOT after that last season, but fuck me in my goat ass I'm hyped.
I was hoping to see Balerion
Fuck yeah HBO
Sadly it won't not work. In the final series they left out all myhtical things.  In lord of the rings magic does mit dissapeared as sauron dies. But in got of thrones after the night king.. with the Dragon  all Things  seems left westeros.
i wouldnt mind if yall just remade season 8 with different directors lol. maybe something like the new version of justice league. keep the good scenes and film bunch of new ones.
The Best 🔥🔥
I am not going to watch this... After such a shitty ending to game of thrones
Knowing HBO allowed Game of Thrones to end that way, I'm having trust issues with this one. But I'm still going to watch it anyway! 😅
I have a feeling this won't go downhill like Game of Thrones since its source material is complete and there are no Dumb and Dumber to ruin everything.
fuck yes
We don’t need more things that aren’t even from the original author. This is gonna be terrible
Game of thrones ❤️
Didn't have any expectations for this but damn this looks promising
Drycarys
Expectations are high! hope it won't crash down 😟
Purposefully skipped the dragons
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
where's the dragons? 😭🔥
Sounds like  ramsey bolten speaking
Wait
Love the look of the Iron Throne in this
I really enjoyed whole GoT series, incl. 8th season. So I am lucky to receive even more.
That Iron throne looks so much better, good god!
Targaryens....😍😍😍😍
come on HBO, Daenerys Hair is better than this new dude wig in the beginning.. even Geralt in netflix looks like they have more budget..
2022 when?
Oh, look, more black washing. How racist.
We are here for dragons 🐉
Now that's the Iron throne🙌
Ah, I love the smell of incest in the morning.
Ended the Witcher in a single trailer
Remember! If anyone sees D&D try to get near this new series... *stick them with the pointy end.*
Ah shiaate, here we go again
Targaryens are back 💥🔥🔥
Okay, now you have my attention.
Plzz Tamil Dubbrd Game of Thrones🙏😍❤️
Why the Africans and Asians?
Good to see (hear) the melody that plays when Daenerys and her dragons are on screen
So the ancestral legacy is on its way guys,lets hope and pray for a better and more successful this one from GOT❤
Dracarys 🐉
I'm eagerly waiting for this ....
BGM 🔥🔥🔥
I wish the throne was taller. Other than that, looks interesting.
Já tamo surtando? SIM
🔥🔥
I wish I could be excited for this but honestly D&D ruined GOT in such a way that anything that comes from this universe is wasted for me. I hope someday down the line they remake asoiaf story the way it should have been done.
To be honest the iron throne looks amazing.
Lmao looks like shit.
Awesome trailer . I hope the actual series is as good as it . I liked the Dragon roar at the end very much 😊👌
I enjoyed Matt Smith and his style of acting in Doctor Who and various movies. I look forward to seeing how it goes this time. BUT seriously that god damn hair piece looks awful. He has shaved his head for a film but they couldn't just dye his hair here?
Umm let's see
"Dreams didn't make us kings "  Take that Bran the broken 😒😒
Can we have a redo of the series starting with these prequels 😐
Hard pass
Why even bother to see this? We already know they die in the end.
Meh...
Try not to screw it up like that last guys.
కుత్త రాంప్ ఇంకా
You better not fuck this one up HBO.
"Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in!"
FIRE & BLOOD!
Are you ready to get disappointed again? :)
0:41 that lady has the valaryan steel dagger used to kill the night king and also used to try and kill Bran.
My hope for games of thrones died a long time ago
I can hear the classic got intro inside my head 😇
Since they're making a prequel for the Fire part, might as well make one for the Ice. There should be a series for the Kings in the North.
Waited for this. Can wait a little longer. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wait, Matt, Dr. Fuckin who,  is gonna be a GOT character now! This is going to be epic!
Hard
Fine! I’ll watch it… GOT is about to send me down yet another rabbit hole😩🤦🏾‍♀️✋🏾
Um yeah real quick .. is Ramin Djawadi here ?
ഇത് പൊളിക്കും..... 🔥🔥🔥
How the f**k did they not include a single dragon in the trailer ??
Dreams didn’t make us Kings, dragons did Everyone: *aw shit here we go again*
Finally, the dream came. ಥ‿ಥ
Wait so wht is this about? It’s about how the Targaryen‘s came and made Westeros or how their empire fell n why they came  to westro??????
I don't care how many Doctors they cast in this - we all know it will have the same train wreck ending as GoT.  I will never let HBO trick me again.
Still disappointed by GoT season 8. How could they mess it up so badly?!
Some notable changes in the throne room, the chair having a LOT more swords in it.
മലയാളി എത്തും ❤️
I have GOT and HBO 10 years of my life, won’t make the same mistake twice. Don’t forget HBO approved of D&D’s outlines for seasons 7 and 8.
YESSSS!!!!
2022 gonna be a good year for new series
O  yeah
This series gonna massive⚡🔥
OMG 😮😮😮😮 can't wait
The Iron Throne still isn't big enough. In the books it's the size of a small aircraft hangar counting all the swords and blades. That said this looks incredible and can't wait to get back to Westeros sans Dumb and Dumber.
straight up chills......😱
Game...Waiting for House of the Dragon
Why these Bastards are even making this show, after ruining the Original series? Fix the Original GOT, no one asked for this!!!!!!!
I think the main plot and more interesting thing on this new show will be the story of Corlys Velaryon and how the sun burnt his skin on his journey so much that he turned black.
Ngl I'm watching this just bcs Matt Smith is there
Valar dracarys - All must die by dragonfire! I just made that up for no reason call me D&D 🤣🤷🏾‍♂️
Now that how the iron throne should look like
Matt Smith, The Doctor
I do not have high hopes for the show but I was excited for this teaser. Still... GoT final trailers were also nice, but it came out empty. So it's hard to say for sure until us watch it.  Valyrians have bad eyes, most of them dark and different... (I'm noy saying dark eyes are bad things- i have brown eyes, but valyrians have not!) no dragon head in the throne room? It's funny that someone remembered that the iron throne had 1000 swords but melted the swords and stuck them on the ground. It's easy to critism if we talk about details, even in this short trailer, but overall it's an impressive introduction.  By the way, who wears Rhaegar's armor? The daemon? :)
why not everyone are the black trans helicopter in this movie?
I want to look forward to this, but I can´t. Not after Season 8.
Fantasy fans when shit like this gets announced: "Did you hear that Gorg Mason wrote the incest dialogue for the 17 dragons who have different colors? Fucking amazing worldbuilding"
Im fucking excited!!!!! Yeaahhhh!!!!!
Finally !!
A trailer about a show called house of dragons and there is not one dragon in it 🤔
Best thing is *Dumb & Dumber are not directing this show!*
I know there was no chances of Emilia coming back as Daenerys since this happens long before she was born, but I’m still saddened about that aha. On another note, this trailer looks amazing. I cannot wait to see more !
Petition to file a restraining order to keep D&D out of this
Aww man! Chills...literal chills
It's really game of thone or a stupid other Wakanda woke movie ? I hope god will reset this disgusting world .
Waiting for this
Let's see. The main thing is not to crap like with the 8th season of Game of Thrones.
''Then the storm broke, and the dragons danced.''
Finally, Alabama of Thrones.     Edit: But I have to keep my expectations low to see if there's a lot of Wincest memes in this series.
The God is going to flip the coin 🪙.
Omg yes yes yes yes
Bastard voice ,
0:38 HAHAHHAHAHAH GET SOME DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION !!!
I have never been able to watch game of thrones, I’ve seen it but I’ll try
Yesssssssss
Only problem being whatever you make in the world of ASOIAF, there is this little voice, whispering at the back of your head, that it all ends with Season 8
at 0:43 you see the banners with archers on them. thats the sigil of house tarly, samwell’s ancestors.
Seeing this like to dislike ratio has me so relieved. I want this show to succeed so badly and restart the GoT hype train. Deliberately held off on reading Fire and Blood so I can get the full experience.
Can't wait for the enmity between The Blacks and The Greens!!😭😭
Here comes another masterpiece
Please hbo max release in india and dubbed in hindi GOT 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
"It is not dreams that make us kings, but dragons"
Is Iwan Rheon the voice speaking in the Trailer????
Yesterday i mentioned GOT... cause everyone is hyped about squid game and i am sure nobody ever watched GOT and now this oh my gooosh gooosebuuumps
Matt Smith! I had no idea!
$10 for it's not as good as the original.
Looking forward to this! So happy to see Matt Smith here ♥️
so the Doctor went back in time and acted as a Targaryen  okay got it please proceed
Збс! Ждём ждём ждём 👍🏻
Uhuuu ...agora de volta aos estudos. ENEM 2022!
IM SO READYYYY
Not 200 years before but close enough
Oh my dragon 🐲 gods.. House Targaryen and Valeryon looks so AWESOME
Cant wait !! Loved all of Game of Thrones. Awesome ending. Cant wait for this one
Ooo
Can't wait to see Vhagar!!
Honestly was not gonna watch this until I found out the eleventh doctor is in it
looking forward to watch it, not looking backward to watch s8
I am waiting for HOG 👑
Welcome Dragon's
Ours is the Fury
Boy that New Thrown Is WICKED!!!
" Dreams didn't make us kings , Dragons did " 🔥 btw guys , there are 17 Dragons in the show 👌
A pero Macri.
Dreams didn't make us kings,Dragons did 🔥
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
too much of dracaras
Lord of the Rings rip-off same with the Witcher tbh
“Dreams didn’t make us kings, dragons did” The final book: a dragon of spring  release date: 2057
one crazed "Whitehead" was enough, and now we getting an entire family.
People don’t go into this thinking about the last 2 seasons of game of thrones, ASOIAF was never completed where as Fire and blood was and has GRRM helping with some of the episodes with the man who pitched GoT and helped write the pilot for the show we fell in love with  also the throne and eyes resemble the ones from the books so hopefully this is a sign of positives things to come!
Vera Mari ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
im ready to get hurt again
Let’s hope they dont build it up for seasons and seasons, then screw the fans with lazy writing at the end again …
Let’s get disappointed for a second time baby!!!!
Amen!
HBO: "Remember how expensive and time consuming those 3 dragons were" VFX Companies: "Yeah jeez - that was a nightmare" HBO: "Yeah we're gonna need like 50 more now"
0:22 is that the blackfyre sword ???
О боже наконец-то ❤️❤️❤️
Black man Targaryen😂😂😂😂  so funny
QUEIMAAAAA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
the main thing is not to screw up .. as with the ending of Game of Thrones.  like. to see the HBO.
I'm so glad HBO did this but as a GOT fan I have to admit that I'm worried it will not live up to the show or even feel like the original.  I hope I am worrying for nothing. I hope it's great.
AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  Team Greeen Till I D.I.E
Summer is coming 🔥
Say what?! Named black characters in Game of Thrones that aren't linked to Slavery?! Whaaaaaat?
Holy f@#k so hyped
TARGARYEN SUPREMACYYYY🛐🛐
After season 8 I really didn’t care about this show. After the trailer I literally can’t wait
A esperarlo hasta el año que viene!
It’s amazing how me seeing one face makes me go “I’m in!”
I hope this is not disappointing... but so excited for it.🌹💖🔥
Black Velaryons. Of course.
Hello Doctor
Это новый сиквел по игре престолов? Огонь 🔥
0:48 wow.........Throne looks badass
https://youtu.be/dQjamUNQh88
Never thought I would see the day YouTube allowed pornography!  I’m ready to be consumed! Let’s go!
I think I'll wait for the final before watching this. After the shitty last season of Game of Thrones I can't afford another delusion... Hope you fired those screewriters and hired some talented people...
😍
Redo the last season of GOTs
Black targaryen? LOL
holy molly!!!!!!
0:18, Balerion the dread funeral
Hell yeah 🔥
Yeah whatev
Blacks in game of thrones  🤣🤣🤣 diversity is our strength
😍😍😍😍😍
But the real original network for this show is HBO.
Yasss 🔥🔥🐉🐉
അടിപൊളി സാനം
If this prequel series starts off awesome, then later it falls  into mediocrity just like it’s predecessor.
Book of "The Wind of Winter": 🗿🗿🗿
I'll watch it if it has copious amounts of incest, otherwise I'll give it a pass.
Hyped.
🔥🥵
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This looks pretty lit.
Makers: Okay we got the Attention , Lets Plan how to spoil the Last Episode..
Netflix adaptation
Winter Is Coming 🚸👀
I can't wait for the prequel to the story that ended like dog crap.
Ohh yes!!!
i love HBO
This little part of my life is called happiness !!
Where is the dragons 😭😭
Very cool
I loved season 8 of Game of Thrones.  One of the top 3 seasons for Game of Thrones.  I am looking forward to the House of the Dragon.  I am really curious as to how the Targaryens interacted as a family.  Also, I am curious as to how was the Targaryens relationship with the Starks were, in those times.  I really do hope that the first season can get me sucked into the series, just like Game of Thrones did.  One thing I can say about Game of Thrones, "IT WAS NOT BORING".  I can't wait to see House of the Dragon.  And, I am wishing the actors, creators, crews and HBO luck, that they can have another winner on their hands.
unbelievable
Gorge R.R Martin has been around for 200 years?
Don't fuck it up this time
SCREAMING !!! 😮
I'm kind of excited again. Hopefully they don't fuck it up like the last one.
Omfg
I hope i don't die before I watch this.
I just wanna see Jon Snow Stark Targaryen again
DxD may not be writing this, but I’m keeping my expectations low regardless.
Dracarys 🔱
Incest? Lots and lots on incest and the hills have eyes? lmao
HBO about to claim its throne again.
Will we get to see Bran the Builder??? He’s my favorite character
I never watched game of thrones, so is this connected in anyway? And how?
Like seeing the child of a girl who broke your heart
Yo Yo Yo, 1-4-8-3 to the 3 to the 6 to the 9, representing the ABQ. What up, biaatch?  was better than Game Of Thrones SEASON 8 Period
No comment on my doctor Matt Smith here ?
DONT RUSH THIS ONE
Matt smith shocked and enraged me
damn just give us some Dragons
Fcking no
this is gonna end up like Caprica, prequel to a great series that ended badly.
The Doctor looks a bit weird here
The new Doctor Who trailer looks lit.
I've never been so excited ⚔
And just like that. HBO made millions of dollars.   Now just shut up and take my money!
i am skeptical....
Who’s writing this show cuz I fear getting invested lol
Another chance to be disappointed ... Dr. Who looks scary ... I just hope this time it won't be a decade in between seasons. Looks good. Until it isn't....
Ironically, the only reason why the Targaryens are in Westeros is because of Daenys the Dreamer.
Now I have to change my sheets...
has no one noticed the dagger alicent was holding, looks familiar
Can somebody turn on the lights please? Can see anything.
So instead of making an anthology from Aegon's conquest, to the Dance of Dragons, to the Blackfyre rebellions y'all are just focusing on one aspect of the House of the Dragon??? Lame. I still can't get the taste of dogshit out my mouth from how y'all ended the last series so I'll pass on this ✋
🔥🔥🔥
....Okay, you know what, this looks pretty good.
Glad to see Matt smith in more stuff
Based on the views so far, we’re all still hurt by season 8 lol
Well fuck, now I have to watch it for mah boi Matt.
Looks like a weird Witcher spinoff. Looks really not GoT style, pretty sure it will never come close to the glory days of GoT
Is that Matt freaking Smith?? All of the yes.
Ffs I’m going to have to watch this aren’t I 🤦‍♂️
I have fainted
Martin and anything he creates is dead to me til he finishes the GOT series, hope he drops dead.
Will they help us relive the past glories of GoT, or reinforce our disappointment with how it all ended?
I like dragons. They are my favorite animal. Exept monkeys. I like them most.
Fuck yes bitch 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hindi mai ayegii
*Will it air on HBO every sunday like GOT?*
Sooo… Winds of Winter?
D&D NO WHERE IN SIGHT PLEASE
Can't wait to see how they ruin this one!!  But Iron Throne is kinda book accurate! Happy about that Seems like they aren't gonna show conquest and first 100 years of their rule, I wonder why?💁‍♂️ And start directly from the Dance!! Casting is disappointing though! How can Velayreon be Black? His is from Valyria!! Rest looks fine But GRRM said there are 17 dragons so that's gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
Mark my words this show will be utter woke gash.
I'm really upset Balerion the Black Dread is already dead when this show starts, but thank the seven for Vhagar!  Edit: corrected Vhagar.
😮😳😤 can’t wait
DRACARYS! FIRE AND BLOOD🐉🔥
Thank God Game Of Thrones  Sequel Is Here.😍😍😍
Netflixed :)
I wish this wouldn't be as bad as 7th and 8th season
Malayalizz
Looks ok.
Just hope the writers don't give up before it's done this time, instead of rushing the ending, like what happened with Game of Thrones.
De todas as séries essa vai ficar incesto lugar
Everyone talking about throne look  Me : Dreams didn't make us king Dragons did
It was Daenys *the dreamer* who had the foresight to flee Valyria 12 years before the Doom. The Targaryens survived because of a dream.
D&D are not here and i am loving it looking forward to house of dragons 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Anya taylor joy must be in this series!
I just hope we don't get burned like we did with that last season of GOT
Plz tamildub game of thrones we are waiting ⚡
Tamil dub pannidugapa🔥🔥🔥
Buy stock in HBO
My most hyped show even surpassing my hype for obi wan kenobi
Don't fuck this one up please like you did with the previous series.
ഈ വരവ് ഒട്ടും expect ചെയ്തില്ല HBO 🔥 കാത്തിരിക്കുന്നു ഈ അത്ഭുതത്തിനായി 😍
The story of 11
തി
So it was The 11th Doctor who took over the Targaryen Dynasty and started the game of thrones. #MattSmith
:40 is it me or does this dining hall look like Hogwarts?
Blackfyre looks sick😳😳, truly the sword of kings
Meh
Hopefully they won’t screw this up.
Aí meu coração... só vem 😄😃
kudos team . at least let this series have a better ending
They should have atleast try to fix the finale of last season of GoT before starting a new spin-off in GoT.
Yeahh
Hell yes!
Soon the Dragon will reign once more! And we get to see it.
തീ..... 🔥🔥🔥
This looks incredible
Looking forward to not watching this
I would rather have Winds of Winter
OH MY GOD THEY ALMOST GOT THE IRON THRONE RIGHT IM SOOOOO EXCITED
Redo the last season of "Game of Thrones"!!!
I know the story and if they follow it, boy this is gonna be a good show
does anyone think GRRM already has the winds of winter and a dream of spring manuscripts written and waiting to go to the editors...but it will only be released posthumously? what if he just doesn't want to see people react badly to the ending he's written, and would rather have people asking "when will you finish it?" rather than "why isnt this as good as the older books?"
Eagerly waitinggg
Doctor whooooo
Speaker's Voice is like Iwan Rhon aka Ramsey Bolton
i just remembered how but was the ending...
Geralt Targaryen
AMAZING
Fortunately, GoT showrunners aren’t involved
Missed opportunity; the three 2s in 2022 could've been dragon symbols
🔥🔥🔥
This is after or before the eleventh doctor regeneration?
Lee gooooo!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Лучше бы последний сезон пересняли!
I really hope D&D are not in charge of it otherwise they will screw it up like how they did GOT from season 7 😒
This looks legit.
Hopefully they won't fck it up like D&D did. 🤞🏾
How can house Velaryon have black skin when they are Valyrian?
Yes Yes Yes!!!!!!!
Corlys’s hair is just...*chefs kiss*
Love Matt Smith. Doctor Who proved he can act.
Wow.. Cant wait to see it!
🐲 GOT ന്റെ കട്ട FAN ആയ ഞാൻ വെയിറ്റ് ചെയ്യുന്ന മൊതലാണ് ഇത്.. 🔥
I thought inbred people looked stunted, deformed. Targaryens shouldn't look that good.
All right Game of Thrones prequel, I'll give you a chance.
Our middle fingers to D&D 🖕
All (literally all) those downplaying it coz of the original GoT clearly are those who never understood the show as well as they think they did! Always expecting the dumb dramatic heroic stuff like marvel, LotR, starwars, harrypotter, twilight etc. True fans know the show was NEVER meant to be anything like those franchises. And NO it wasn't rushed. Just showed that SO MANY didn't pay attention. Period!
Oh, I'm so waiting for it!!!!
Came here  for the doctor
THIS LOOKS AWESOME
They changed the iron throne for no reason. It’s not similar to the book nor the previous show lol 😆.
This should really blow past our expectations to brush off the bitterness we all felt from how the last season ended.👍🔥❤
king's landing pickpockets stole some swords. Not even the throne is safe in this story.
Soo excited 😊
Me: I am done with the ice and fire series and books HBO: makes a 30 second teaser  Me: going to read the books and watch my favorite episodes again
✨✨Emmys ✨✨
we were all burned by the last series that shall not be named… HBO lost a lot of trust and I don’t know if this is going to win much back.. here’s to hoping.
Please don't f**k it up, cause the last season of GoT killed the best series in the world...
Wont look again 8 sesons for a shitty end
0:38 чистокровные Таргариены 🐵🐵🐵
Can't wait to see 😍 🙌 🤗
S8 left something that I couldnt shake off. Hope this will redeem it. I tho Arya did the most should have been Queen not the useless cripple. They should of kill that Character.
Looking forward to get hooked to this, and then be utterly disappointed with the finale
Hoping that I could manage to finish reading the book before the show started to air.
past is more quality than future😁
❤️
I'll never forgive HBO por what they did to GOT. I might watch this, but sure as hell I'll watch it with a pain in my heart. House Targaryen deserved so much better.
Found something to look forward to
Pretty convinced they’ll messed it up like last season.
"Enter the Dragon"
I hope they show us Balereon The Black Dread
Matt Smith? Matt Smith. Matt Smith!
DREAMS DIDN'T MAKE US KINGS ‼️ DRAGONS DID🔥
Well the iron throne looks awesome. Corlys looks ridiculous, of course..
I am waiting  for it 💘
I laugh at everyone who comments that they won't watch it. Then why are you commenting on a teaser that just went online?
What month in 2022. I want to time my Covid shot so I’m still around to watch it.
Dr Who is a Targeryen
That iron throne is SICKKKK..!
Didn't think I was as excited as I am for this but I had goosebumps throughout!
"DRAGENS DID"⚔️
I want a season 8 remake with competent writers
story of the dark ages. when I mean dark, I mean "dark"... literally! dear editors, you can nudge the brightness up a bit if you want to have a show... instead of a no-show. I hope it won't be another GoT Season 8 finale, where you guess the show amidst the darkness, instead of seeing.
намааана
After season 8 i have no hope for this new show, I mean i just can't.
MATT SMITH?!!!
Cant wait to seee🥶🥶🥶
*Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did*
Also called: The unseen adventures of the Doctor
Seems like they got the name of Daemon BLACKfyre a little too literal.
That silly Doctor messing around with different timelines...
*A
🔥🔥🔥 Fire and Blood 🔥🔥🔥
Black Targaryans... Ok I'm out.  Besides, we all know the ending and how shit it is.
I'm currently watching GOT S3 and now this 🥺 I don't know but I know I feel like I made a good choice🥺🤧❤️
how you gunna have the title HOUSE OF THE DRAGON and show no fucking dragons???
I hope this is not a prequel of the tv series, but the true prequel of the novel. I want see really a reebot of Game of Thrones, but instead of having a title a game of thrones, i want the true title, a song of ice and fire.
Literal Chills 😁
I hope they do this with the source material on hand. We all know how it ended the last time they haven't done that.😨
I'm going to be playing it smart and wait until this is over before watching. I'm not going through another GoT lol.
Are they going to screw this up right at the end like they did the last one?
Me tremi inteiro meu deus
I can't wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Happy that Alt Shift X can make some good ol' content. Missed you buddy.
Ulala
why am i so emotional?! it's going to be a great show-
Don't mess up in last season. .
Try not to f*ck this up HBO, I have been burned before...............................
bro docter who is overpowered in game of thrones thats not fair. he must of traveled real damn far back to get there though. hope the tardis is the suprise cameo
why does it sound like ramsey bolton
That bgm still running in my mind
The Targaryen theme 🔥🔥🔥🐉🐉
I am missing game of thrones very much
Wooooooooooot! Excitement!!!
hopefully it doesn't turn out like season 8..
Is that the catspaw dagger in Alicent’s hand at 0:41?
Wow! My reaction will probably be like Tyrion's when he see's the Dragons for the first time after watching this show! Super excited to relive the GOT vibes again! Btw crazy dialogue "Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did".
Mother of dragons 🐉
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssss!! finally!
If they changed the Iron Throne they also should have gave the Targaryens purple eyes imo
We wuz dragons and shiet
Waiting
👏😭👏😭👏😭👏😭👏😭👏😭👏😭
Come on George its time to finish a Game of Thrones.
White walkers
Ive been watching fake teasers for so long I’m having a hard time believing this is real.
*Will this show be seasons 1-4 or 5-8* ?  That's the real question we should be asking.
Get ready to turn your tv brightness to MAX 😂. Also, we need a redemption after the season 8 flop, seriously
Stark
Can people with platinum-blonde hair have dark coloured eyebrows? Just curious. (I'm a person born with pitch black hair, so excuse my ignorance)
black targaryans? wtf?
theon and jamie are the best
HBO otw to start off well and take a big dump on the ending for the nth time?
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD, I CANT DEAL
Podunga mass su than
Okay... Hyped
"An" HBO Original Series?? xD
Damn I need to watch game of thrones first 🤦‍♂️
still bummed the makeup and hair make the actress playing rhaenyra look old
0:09 you’ve written this wrong, it should be ‘a HBO original series’ not ‘an HBO original series’. What the hell it’s simple grammar
WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS???!!!!
Omg I can’t wait
🔥🔥🔥
♥️🔥
Looking forward to seeing all 17 of the dragons in this series.
Finally ❤️
Wish they showed atleast one dragon in the clip
200 years before ?  🤔
House Velaryon... Kekw
Little finger - there is no 1000 blades even 200 House of Dragon - 0:48 😐
I want to be excited. I feel like I should be excited. But the final season broke me as a fan.
2022 great year 😍
🔥
Targaryen? More like Rastafaryen FIYAH BUN
as ,long as dumb and dumber arent around directing, it might be okay
This is too much for me to handle rn 🔥😫 I've never been this hyped for a show man Daemon's armour😫🔥🔥 The helmet ; the wings on it 🔥 This show is going to RULE 2022
This is going to be epic😍🔥🔥
Finally ❤️❤️❤️
We Wuz Targaryan and sheeet!
Goosebumps.
Damn. As enticing as it may be, it’s going to be difficult for millions of angry ASoIaF fans to separate this prequel series from the upsetting final two seasons of GoT. Different show handlers, different writers, GRRM is more involved(?), completely different narrative, etc.. but the taste for Westeros may already be tainted for too many. We’ll wait and see. I myself am kind of eager to see this.
Acordar com um bom dia desses... Não estava preparado HBO 🥵🤩🤩
Since when Corlys Velaryon is from Summer Isles?
Awesome!! 🔥😍
Can't wait for 2022.
Браво!) очень жду!
who cares this shit .. season finale of GTO was a BIG SHIT ... shame on you guys
I'm over it though
House of the Dragon " teaser"........ NO DRAGONS lol!!!
YIKES.
Looks like Shit
im ready for the woke version of GOT!
These some ugly ass targareyans I thought they were pretty
Can't watch this after knowing that the rightful queen didn't get to rule the kingdoms even after 200 damn years thanks got season 8 for spoiling the story I absolutely loved
Matt smith looks fucking amazing
Can't wait💥⚡️
Are the black characters Targaryens?
Where is my Balerion the Black Dread!!!!!!
This looks so good!!! I can’t wait to go back to the World of Westeros!!!
I want winds of winter 😩
Oh god its happening
Beautiful. But I'm always hoping for a colossal prequel feature film about the War of the Trident. Imagine the fucking epic that would come out of the screen.
Idk why but Dragons can’t be without Daenerys
OK I'm here for this...
The sword, the dress... You can see HBO does not joke when it's about money !!! Fire is back !
Hopefully Ramin Djawadi is composing the music.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s a contest between Matt Smith vs David Tenant who will have the best post Dr. Who career.
It'll be a load of shite.
Don't.Let.Us.DOWN
Where is the dragons?????
Where is my Balerion the Black Dread!!!!!!
I just hope we get to see Robert's Rebellion 😟
Oh god please don’t make it with a woke cast 😕
When it's will start
Where is the dragon , give  me the dragonssssssssssssssssss
Змей Горыныч на месте, бабу Ягу добавят?
💥💥💥
Please don't be woke trash...
Jon Snow: I don't want it.
Sounds like Matt Smith...
Matt Smith looks like he lost a lot of weight to play his part in this show.
This shit looks fucking incredible 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that's uh, very whelming.
Let's hope the new showrunners won't screw up this project as the previous did at GOT
Hey, at least we won't be disappointed by the ending.
Plz release Tamil dubbing version
Waiting, It Better be good like GoT 🥲
There hasn't been enough time for me to forgive GoT for Season 8...
Idgaf about this show, we needed a sequel not a prequel.
Non me ne frega un cazzo
naah im not excited since season 8 but i gotta admit, that armor looks badass is that doctor who?
nice
how about you just remake the last two seasons with actually good writing?
DRAGONS
The sour taste of the final seasons of Game of Thrones has me hesitant in watching this.
Looks like a bunch of key jingling. One can never atone for the disaster that was GOT and at this point unless George puts out the remainder of the series, I'm likely done being invested in his world.
Omg someone get me an Time machine
How can I watch this in the UK when it comes out?
Targaryen's are here🤩
Here's hoping we're not only going to see the dragon-action at the start and at the climax of the show, with pretty much next-to-nothing in the middle.
I will pay you twice but please don't spoil ending
Dear RR.Martin and HBO ......i just...don´t trust you anymore....
Is it just me or does the speaker sounds a bit like Iwan Rheon aka Ramsay Bolton aka Ramsay Snow
Man but don't change the music 😊
I actually know this whole Lore, so....      OMEGA-LEVEL HYPE!
0:31 Man of steel vibes
I am so hyped
Finally the most anticipated series is coming 💥💥💥💥💥. What an exciting trailer 💥💥
I swear to god if they screw this up
Be ready to....   get disappointed once again.
Iam almost certain that was the Rogue prince and  Queen Rhyna
One thing I request to HBO Max, Please don't rush and finish the series like you did to Game of Thrones, Take your time for shooting and stream it...... Please don't rush it
YES YES YES!! I need this masterpiece in my life! Please let the finale be better than GOT.
"Dragons dint kill lannisters,  Danny did"-Bran Stark
Holy moley! Eeek!
As long as David and Dan have absolutely nothing to do with this I'm sure it'll be great
lol no thanks HBO
Omg
D&D are not here to mess things up this time around. Looking forward to it
Just want to see little finger again
ye ye yeah!
If someone Loves the last season of Game of thrones, u can easily understand how much this guys waiting for house of dragon,already epic
Petyr Baelish : So there were a 1000 Blades
So Prince Phillip in The Crown was a Targaryen decent. 😂
AFTER THE ABSOLUTE CLUSTER F*** OF AN ENDING LAST TIME. I WILL ONLY BE DOWNLOADING THIS. YOU WILL NO EARN 1c FROM ME..
❤️❤️❤️
Black Targarians ahahahahahahah so funny ))))
Who cares?
❤️
Get ready !!!  It is going to beat records... 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Waiting
Was a fan of the GOT books, stopped watching after season 5. Glad Matt smith is doing bigger and better things than dr who (liked dr who too). depending on the initial reviews i may or may not get hbo lol
Goosebumps
HBO is just desperate to keep the GOT franchise going.
Yaaaa monnneaaaaa ⚡⚡⚡⚡
Don't fuck with the ending others will blow that dragon's fire in your ass!
There’s Disney plus. Netflix. Hulu. Apple plus.. and then there’s HBO Max—a league of their own.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Frankly darling, I don't give a damn
This looks fucking awful... I see the spirit of the final season has been passed on to this one!
Don’t lose sight of the genius who created this amazing, mind-blowing world and these astonishing characters: GRRM. (On a related note, I love seeing him troll his weakest fans by delaying WoW again and again. Gotta give it to the man: he’s got a sense of humor.)
Tamil dubbed
Boy that music in the end just gave me chills.
Dr who looks like witcher wannabe
Finally....! Was waiting for it so long....😻 Hope that it's a magnificent series than GOT✌️
ഇംഗ്ലീഷ്കാരെ അറിയിക്ക് മക്കളേ നമ്മുടെ മലയാളികളുടെ പവറ് #####keralafans GOT❤
Хорошо хоть загорелых добавили поболше
kinda hoping this is an even better show. as a non-book reader I'm still excited
Who Paused and Play and Pause and Play and Paused this video like me ? 🖐️🖐️
IT LOOKS LIKE SHIT! ALSO, the Iron Throne should be much bigger!! Ye just dont learn don't you HBO!?
No D&D? Might be good.
Meanwhile, George Martin has just finished page 12 of The Winds of Winter.
House Of The Dragons🔥  മലയാളികൾ എത്തിയില്ലേടാ ❤
Let's hope the final season turns out good this time😅😅
All hail the Queen 👑
I am missing dragon queen already..
The best series is going to rebirth again💚💫
Fool me once.......I think I'll pass.
Technically, dreams did make them kings since the dream of a little Targaryen girl did warn them about the fall of their original seat and then they moved to Westeros, so ...
Here we go again. They've drawn me in again. Sigh...
I wanted the Targarys to look a lil more Aesthetically pleasing 🙄 they look tired and old they could've did better casting 😐 but ima say less yayyy we got a Trailer tuh
Any tamil fans 🔥💯👍
Nary a dragon was seen nary a dragon was heard. House of dragon, they said.
I'm really excited about the first 7 seasons of this show, it's gonna be lit
0:47 Now THAT is the Iron Throne.
Can't wait to see Balerion The Black Dread
all this for bran to sit on the throne?
Sorry, no.
THAT TARGARYEN ARMOR LOOKS SICK ASF
Rest assured David and Dan aren't anywhere near the production set
i hope the ending wont suck like GOT. i mean 10 years of watching a show and to be slapped like that. NEVER AGAIN
This is going to flop big time if we only see few dragons..
Can't wait for the new memes.
SO F*CKING HYPE ABOUT THIS LETS GOOO
OMMMMGGGGGGGGG
Forget the Winter, TARGARYENS ARE HERE!!!!
Fuck yeah! Dragons did it for the Targaryen🔥🔥
Aw shit here we go again
Is that the voice of Joseph Morgan Aka Klaus? Cause I got excited for a bit😍
🤯🤯🤯😇😃😃😃
*Valar Morghulis*  🖤
Telugu fans here 💪
Dreams didn't make us king 🔥 DRAGONS DID 😭😭😭 🔥🔥
*Ezio family theme playing on background*
Didn't read the books, but was there ever a black Targaryen as seen in this teaser? I mean I remember George R. R. Martin being bashed for not diversifying his characters enough in Westeros, I hope HBO didn't fall for this bullshit and add a black character in a obviously very white lineage. I'm not trying to instigate a debate, I'm just curious.
I will wait till the show is finished. If there's a shitstorm afterwards I won't bother.
Ну наконец-то годный сериал !!!
Iron man will be in this one... He will ride a dragon... He will copy DNA go back to 21st cent and recreate Jurrasic park
Season 8 hbo. Let that be your reminder. Season 8....
🔥
Let's hope they don't mess this up too.
Holy shit
explain to me how the velaryons are black since they intermarried a lot with the targaryens. this world is intertwined with genetics, a war broke out because the heir of the king did not have his father's hair color. makes no fcking sense.
HBO hear us now. If you ruin this like you did the last one, never again will anyone be excited for one of your shows. #FuckDan&Dave
As long as D&D are staying the hell away from this, I'll give it a shot. But GoT was botched SO BADLY that I can't even bring myself to watch the 6 good (well, except for lines like BAD POOSAY) seasons, knowing it ends so poorly. I'd have kept buying merch, tried to get other people into it, and kept my HBO sub up if GOT's ending had been good. Lesson learned, HBO execs?
Yaa mone🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish Please.....let everyone should forget Last season of GOT by watching this series
Fooooodaaaa 🔥🔥😍
THIS LOOKS AMAZING 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Please don’t suck like season 8 Please don’t suck like season 8 Please don’t suck like season 8
Don’t worry winter is not even close 🥶 🐉
Daemon 🔥🔥
Book accurate: the throne Not book accurate: random black guy with blond hair
Ooolala
please hbomax launch in india before release house of the dragon
Music 🔥🔥🔥
I am very excited!!!!’
Dreams didnt make us kings dragons did 👌 Golden stuff
I really really wouldve liked it it we d get to see Alyssa farmans journey across the sunset sea plus nettle and the conquest of dorne
Enta mone vishayam 💥
they’ll just screw it up like season8 .. pass
you know I'm going to be honest....idk if I want to see this show or I really deep inside just wanted a better season 8 and a season 9 to G.O.T. hell finishing at a 10th would have been better then this!!!
ooooooooooooooh
😱😱😱😱
🌼 Looks like they Black washed a Few Characters to appease the Black Community & Leftists 😝😂
CASH IN NOW. Greedy self enlightenment doesn't impress me. HBO. Fuck off.
The Doctor seems devoted to fitting in with this era
Daemon : Dreams didn't make us king, dragons did  Bran : Hold my raven
No Dragons SadKEK
0:46 The narrator is Ramsay Bolton??? Lol
Nah-ah, Im not falling for the same level of dissapointment all over again, no. NO.
I'm not sold just yet by this teaser.
0:41. Arya's Valyria knife?
YAAAAS
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
I love this!!!
HBO I LOVE YOU THANK YOU
That's the Fucking doctor
Yeah boyyyy🔥
Omg😍🔥🔥🔥
:(
I'm once again all in for Targareyan MADNESSS!!
This timeline won’t be about Robert and Ned starks right?
0:38 so this show covers more than just old Valyria :)
Without white walkers there will be a void .
I waiting for ROBERT"S REBELLION 🦌 like if you are 👍
Late 2021/2022 is going be a stacked year for shows, movies, and games
0:46 is it ramsay bolton voice ?
Just don't mess it up like GoT.. PLEASEEE!!!!
Looks like old 11th's having a bit of a memory crisis, ah well I'm sure he'll find his good old TARDIS sometime.
Sea snake doesn't look like valyrian
😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ente mwonneee etha range ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
The real valyrians were as beautiful as gods i dont think so they ll find that many bela hadids and Liam hemsworths to fill that description
I wear a blonde wig now. Blonde wings are cool.
Shut up and take my money!
Mad king is in da house
I love Got  and I'm actually a house targaryen fan to the bone BUT after the blasphemy that was the last season of Got i I don't even care anymore I'm not gonna invest my time on this I have the book
Not sure I like the filtery look, other than that this looks phenomenal
Matt Smith is... Geralt of Valyria.
Without Charles Dance it can't be as good as game of thrones.
Hope they don't have us watch this for nearly a decade and botch the last season.
Too bad we know how it ends
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
cringe
Is this got prequel or sequel?
"The fall of the iron throne" ? More like "fall of the series"
GOT S8 is not canon
Waiting 🔥
Geez, Velaryons look so stupid
They should tease the finale first.
Finally finally ❣️❣️ Who was waiting for this teaser eagerly??
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
No dreams just saved their family from being roasted alive 200 years before this :p
ഗെയിം ഓഫ് ത്രോൺസ് ഫാൻസ്‌ ❤️
Meh.
Ngl this looks awesome. And zero D&D involvement.
Dragons did🔥🔥🔥
Hunger games catching fire little symbol flame there
Petition to make the dragon fire coloured like it is in the books.
Without the huge financial and critical  success that was GOT they wouldn't be spending this much time and money on this show, just sayin'.
You Couldn't Live with the Failure, Where Did that Bring You? Back to Me
No Way i'am not dreaming
2022....please don't disappoint.
Yessss, super hyped for this❤✨
ohhhh  myyyy God!
Any Doctor Who fans here? Matt smith was my favourite Doctor. Thankyou for casting him.
Matt's voiceee😍😌
Yeah, nah. I'll pass. The Problem will forever be that it ultimately will end in that awful season 8.
The Iron throne 🔥🔥🔥
0:38 the Targaryens have the first case of the so-called black skin disease of ancient Valyria
It’s look like big deep shit
Literal chills
Dreams didn't make us kings but dragon did💥🔥
ഡ്രാഗൺ എവിടെ??
Imagine if it turns out to be good and then you remember while watching how it will end.
Can’t wait!
Tomara que tenha a mesma abertura de game of Thrones,pelo menos no toque ,(TAN TAN ,TANNN TAN TANN,TAN TAN 🎶🎶)
What made GOT so powerful was the storyline of the underdogs. It made us cheer and cry for them. I doubt this will be the case for the prequel. Going to watch it without making further comparisons
Probably best for me to go into this show without any expectations (because of The disappointment with GOT’s final season). But I’m excited for this regardless.
I'm willing to invest in this series if dumb and dumber are nowhere near it, i.e. D&D.
Damnnnnnn dude🔥 I just wish they didn’t ruin the Valeryons 💔💩
Would have been cooler to see a proper ending to game of thrones instead of this Shit.
🔥
Keep Dumb and Dumber far far away from this. And please hire Ramin Djawadi to do the composition again 🙏🙏.
Can't wait for season 8! Too soon?
Another level
откуда там негры??
One of danys music themes is playing in the background,  hopefully ramin djawadi keeps the same Targaryen theme, would be epic
chills
Is Matt Smith Aegon the Conqueror?
Eh... if the writing isn't good then this show may not work.
😎
Why does this feel more like the witcher than the entire witcher series
Yooo putting aside how the show ended, this looks really cool and i looove how the throne looks more like how it was described in the books!
Ahh shit..... Here we go again.
The iron throne looks so much more accurate <3 <3 <3😁😁😁😁😁😁
Time to read to whole books of serise again...
Yes
This still gives me an aching sadness about how badly the original series ended 😢
Hype
0:38 are those lords of house Crack?
We are team Targaryan 🔥🔥🔥
Dragons did! 🐉🖤
Yes! Finally we have a trailer. Can’t wait!
I guess HBO went with this one instead of the weight walker prequel because the story is complete in the books.
i neeeeeeeeeeeed ittt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm already in even though I was so frustrated with the finale of GOT.  Looks very interesting.
Where are the dragons where are the goddamn dragons?
My only issue is that the Sea Snake is miscast. He has the blood of Old Valyria in his veins so he should look like a Targ. Now, if this had been his bastard grandson/son who was the son of a common woman... it could work.
Nice beginning let's not butchered the end of the show!!!
Now the original cast can enjoy GOT too xD
In theory the dialogue will be top tier. I'm sure the showrunners will be very wary of replacing political intrigue and witty discourse with spectacle alone.
sorry, but why genetics of targarien works strange. I mean colour of hair but...
Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did🔥🔥
Excellent cast choice so accurate well done.
The Doctor's next adventure looks violent
THE ACCURACY OF THE THRONEEE 💯
The Doctor rides dragons now?  Yeah, I can see that.
Can't wait
This gonna be fire 💥💥💥
So it looks like they're skipping the conquest, the rise and fall of maegor the cruel and jaehaerys the conciliator just to skip to the dance of dragons.. which I mean cool but why not start at the actual beginning of the targaryan rule instead of  a hundred years in? Missing alot of good material..  Idk why I'm bitching, I'm just ready to get rid of the bitter taste s8 left..
I’m watching. I live in a reality where season 8 GOT didn’t happen anyway.
you can hear daenerys' theme in the background
HBO : Choose your plan. Pirates : He He Boi

I hope they have different director this time
I can't wait 🔥🐉😔
o look its a prequel  to that show that never had a final season.
WTF is the Doctor doin in game of thrones
Gods. Kings. Fire. Blood. Bleach.
Will i give a shit to watch it after final season debacle.. I won't..
Starting laa nalla thaa iruku aanaa finishing sari illaye paa
Doctor is that u?
I dont know man it just feels weird after the heart broken finale of got .
Let's hope this has a decent ending
Maushi Chhi 🤯🤯🤯
I love it.....❤️❤️
what an ugly trailer    lpm
sure but meh
wow.
This shit about to make the first one look like childs play!
What we want is Here 🤩🐉
Sleepless nights are coming 🔥🔥
Finally ❤❤❤
I'm still not holding my breath for this after the terrible last season of game of thrones
Best series in the world - : GOT (including  season 8 a bit )don't listen to f**king critics GOT is the best   Now this might be a great too let's see💥💥💥
"Dreams didn't make us kings. Dragons Did" Its time to burn them all!
Veera Targaryen vamsamada 🔥
that detail on Iron throne alone makes me believe that these guys are following the book than doing there own shit like d&d dickheads!
I am so psyched 😁🙌
“Guns don’t kill people - dragons do” - the vibe I was getting from that line!
Targaryan stole my bike
i really afraid  its become like witcher this lookto me to good but got need brutality and darkness so i hope they dont clean this to much
Please please don't let Dan and Dave anywhere near it...
Ok - I am going to give to one more chance HBO - this is where you make it up - THIS IS WHERE!!!
I hate that they've made me excited for game of thrones again
"Remember this day little brother. Today, Life is happy."- Boromir
i will be searching for Tardis somewhere in the background
Tidy.
❤️😍
"I'll take what is mine through fire and blood."
Why am I getting Troy vibes from this???
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
isso que é BOM DIA hbo
Please don't do adult
I’m so confused as to when this is supposed to be set. It can’t be Aegon’s landing or the reign of Maegor the Cruel because that was 300 years ago, not 200. It can’t be the Dance of Dragons because that was 160 years ago, involved a lot more than two Targaryens and quite a few dragons which would the be the first logical thing to show in a trailer. It can’t be the Blackfyre rebellion because that happened 100 years ago. The tales of Egg and Dunk happened 90 years ago.  Is this just the story of some random Targaryen 50 years out from when all the interesting stuff was happening?
Anything from George RR Martin I will watch. He is great great!!
Keep those D&D retards far away from this and any future series!
MEU DEUS EU TO MUITO FORA DE MIM
gods, kings, blood, fire.............. everything except dragons ......
The Iron Throne uff 😍
Do not fuck it up like S08, I beg of you...
I can’t waiiiiit!!! Targaryen for life. ❤️🔥
Waiting 😍🔥
i guess we are not going to see that black dread at all
Lol game if thrones is like Crack
Honestly would have liked a show about the long night instead but wtv we move I guess
The hand of the king they show, is that the Lord Stark who sat upon the throne for a day? I believe his name was Cregan.
Not this again.🤦🏾 I had read that George R.R was working on production of Nnedi Okorafor's "Who Fears Death" and FINISHING THE BOOKS but here we are House of Dragons 🤣(this is for dude bros). I would only watch for Matt Smith.I have read "Dunk and Egg", "World of Ice and Fire", and the "Fire and Blood" encyclopedia (part 2 has not been written but I don't trust it. If Martin can ink a t.v. deal he will never finish the books.🤦🏾
Just don't screw this up like you did on season 8😁
WE WAZ TARGARYENS
I hope they don’t make the beginning of it as slow as GOT and the ending as fast as GOT
I've really missed how the dragons sounded. Love the sound they make when they're about to breathe fire. ❤
❤️
Where are the dragons???
Is drogon there in the show
OMG , Finally 🐲🤯
Why is Ramsay Bolton doing the voice over or is that just me ? 😳😳🤔
Man, this looks epic!!
And they still couldn't be bothered to give Valyrians purple eyes.
Jon snow pappa and mama❤ is nice❤
0:30 is that Bella Ramsey?
Who the fuck has disliked this?????!!??
Hope this time won't end up like S8 games of thrones 🙃🤞
https://youtu.be/3M12cKkymos
Ohh woooo woooo here it came again to entertain us
Anyone actually gives a fuck? Seriously?
HBO, why should I watch this? I can't handle another disappointment like season 8 of GOT.
💥
Amazing wow!
Amazing wow!
No dragons at all in a trailer meant to show a piece of history where there were tons of them?
Meanwhile we still wait for George R.R. Martin's next book Winds of Winter to be released.
Wakkali...tharumaru...semmaya iruku...
Most Waited item🔥🔥
Prince Philips in Game of thrones
Wow the throne looks way cooler now where'd all he swords go
Fire 🔥 house of Targaryen🔥 i'm so ready to dance with  dragons 🐉
ooooh
I am very much excited
"Dreams didn't make us kings" Danny the dreamer: ...
Amazing wow!
TARGARYEN SUPREMACY
Give me a break
GoT already flopped. By all means milk it for all its worth but I don’t see what the hype is all about
Looks great got goosebumps after seeing the iron throne again can't wait for hotd👑👏 #FIREWILLREIGN
*No hype at all for these anymore, sadly.*
CHILLS!!! CHILLS!!! Now THIS is how you make a TRAILER for an EPIC Fantasy! #got #firewillreign
The iron throne looks so different
Hermoso
OMG OMG OMG OMG
രോമാഞ്ചം കൊണ്ട് പുളകിതനായി മലയാളികൾ ആരുമില്ലേ 🤙🏽💯
Someone please tell me Dumb & Dumber aren’t involved in this in any way.
They better make up for season 8!!! Lol!!!
I'm a bit sceptical of Matt Smith as a Targaryen bad ass, but I'm willing to give it a chance.
My hype turned down a little with the throne and the throne room, it’s looking way different from GoT, breaking the immersion for me
Two words: BURN THEM ALL!!!
WOAAAAAA SERIOUSLYYYYY
WOAH, for a second I thought this was the family of Geralts.
iron throne.. that damn iron throne 🔥🔥🔥
Get woke, go broke
Will the last season also screw up like in Game of Thrones?😡
Looks amazing just don't mess it up again
Aaaaaaaah🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Black Targarians matter
More like House of Albinos
Reboot?
i bet that's Daemon Targaryen speaking
Looking forward to the Game of throne without D&D
If D&D has a part in this I'm not gonna watch it
another piece of garbage without George RR Martin
Dreams made bran king.....But dragons made danaerys the true queen.👑
This part of my life is happiness 🥺🥺
"Dreams didn't make us king" sounds like a jab at bran
Omg I’m so happy I could cry!
Hope Weiss and Benioff would not produce it.
The Sea Snake looking bad ass
What's the point when we know that in this universe, season 8 ends up happening
Please Dubbed In Hindi
Hopefully it's better than the shitfest that was Game of Thrones at the end
Is it Dunk and Egg story?
It looks like this show will be even MORE VISUALLY STUNNING than GOT. Can't wait.
Chance Melissandra could be in this
Without D & D Dumb and Dumber  it should be better than Game of Thrones
Omgggggggg
Man I am gonna miss Tyrion Lannister
I bet melisandra shows up in this too.
Please just don't fuck up the ending..
Long chapters are coming with only conversations, get ready
*it took me 11 years before watching the whole Game of Thrones franchise but now, I AM HERE FOR THIS!*  *DRACARYS*
0:44 leanor velaryon!!
Oh. My. God.
Iron thorne 🔥
Silver hairs will be the new craze now!!
I don’t want to be excited…But I’m SO f*cking excited.
The narration over this is sexy as hell
Matt Smith as the rogue prince! I'm ready 💪🏾 🙌🏾
Hindi language
Where are the dragons??????
Every time a god is born the coins flip a Targaryen
Alright now where's Preston Jacobs at
What a way to hype up the fans. I’m so excited man
Finally, the official HBO version of Blackfyre :000
Where's jhon?
let the incest reignnnns
Can't wait to get disappointed by this show's finale after 5 years :D
The Mad King!!!?🥺
after they fucked up the show, nah nnnaaaaahhhh
Release in India please.... and In hindi also
Ohhhh God, FInally
Больше негров...
Milk 'em boi , milk 'em hard af
Oh ini bukan buatan daddy
Waiting 🔥🔥🔥
Waiting eagerly to see Aegon the Conqueror in the iron throne ... Then only we realise that joffery didn't have that dignity.. 😅😅
Sorry HBO, I already have a deluxe plan known as "Telegram"
💥
Gonna squint my eyes and look from afar
Do you know who should be the lead actor Targaryen conqueror? Joseph Morgan. He should be the one saying in that voice, "Dreams didn't make us Kings, _I_ made us Kings. And my dragons subdued the world."
I hope they explore the Themes here and don't shy away from them like they did in Game of Thrones.
🔥🔥🔥
Yes sir yes sir ! Got is back on the menu boyz.
Woah
Poli 🔥 saanam,
Waiting ❤️❤️❤️ Malayalis Pever kanikk 😍  👇
Before trailer: meh still hurt after S8… After trailer: You son of a bitch… I’m in.
The hype is real🔥🔥🔥
u gonna leave a water bottle in the show and rush the ending in this series too?
Not even a single dragon was harmed in the making of this trailer 😀
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did..." Absolute Fact
Hopefully people will shut up about season 8 after this
Afro-valyrians :))
Lol don’t shit the bed this time!
0:41 is that the dagger Arya used to kill The Night King?
HBO : CHOOSE YOUR PLAN ME:🌝🌝😋
Aight... Good start, now just don't fuck this up.
This looks seriously good
Waiting ... ❤️❤️❤️
I thought I lost all of my desire to read or watch anything in this universe after the final season of Game of Thrones but this makes me so hype. Now I'm gonna read the House of the Dragon again.
I can't believe that the trailer has arrived 🤗🤗🤗
I think ths could be a whole series of season 8.
Shouldn't it say 'A HBO original series' and not 'An HBO original series' ?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The dragons are coming home.
Fire & Blood.
If films were tissue paper. Matt Smith is like a spilt cup of water. Ruining everything he touches
Try not to muck this one up yeah?
This is about you and me getting a spin-off show, the rest are just here to get us through those doors.
hope it will not end like season 8
After all that BS they pulled off on the final shitty season no thank you. Pass. My guess is the writers of this Game of Thrones history cheated history by just like they cheated Terminator history.
0:37 that's some baaaad ass armor.
fucking pog champ!!!! brightly colored dragons and flames!!! i hope soo!
HBO Max is not available in my country! 💔 so unfair!
House of the dragon aka the civil war that fucked the targaryen dynasty into the ground.
More like 200 years before the fall of the show.
HBO, if you screw up this time, don't expect an audience from me. I will not insist.  I think we can agree that you've learned enough from the Season 8 horror show right?
Hallowe’en 2022 costumes say what
YESSS!!! 🥳🥳🥳
More like Mortal Kombat
Waiting for balerion the black
HOUSE OF THE DRAGON!!! 😭🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Bruh why do the velaryons look so bad 🤣
Never watched a episode of these but I might do because of matt smith
GAME OF THRONES IS BACK!!! 🥳🥳🥳🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
DIVERSITYYYYY
First of all, who’s writing the script? On second, that armor at 0:37 looks awesome.
it looks like a fan made project..
i swore i would never watch it after GOT ended but here I am again.
It's cool to see a continuation of this world without those two bozos but I gotta admit, I'm kinda tired of dragons.. It's so played out these days.
was that sir dunk jousting?"
0:41 Sonoya Mizuno 😍😍
Oh baby baby baby , this is FIRE
Yaaassss its here
Matt Smith, that's it. That's all I need.
Yes! The more book accurate Iron throne and dragons. Looking forward to fire and blood.
I'm in love.  It all looks so good!!!! Also was that Vhaegar that I spotted ???
Oh my god oh my go OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!
0:42 I SWEAR THAT’S LITTLEFINGER’S DAGGER!!
After season 8, no thanks.
♥️♥️♥️
THATS CATSPAW AT 0:42
I will watch the Pirate Copy . I won't Subscribe HBOMax Until You Give Update Of SnyderVerse (Positively)     .........
of course they had to make valeryon black, because why not
stop
https://youtu.be/dQjamUNQh88
I guess the doctor lost his tardis
Whats the use of this if we all know how badly it ends
Everyone saying “the iron throne looks so much like the description in the books” and I’m like huh? Did ya’ll even read them? The throne in the books had a WHOLE ascension of about 20 concrete steps. Sticking swords in the floor surrounding the throne does NOT do the books justice.  Dope trailer though. Can’t wait
i hope they don't ruin the end of this show....like the way they did with got
Where r the dragons? Meanwhile dragon still under construction
Fire will reign 🔥
I'm calling it now.. five good/great seasons, 2 decent ones and one that I don't personally hate but does deserve the hate.
Just dont fuck the ending up like GoT
How are you all Planning on to let down audience in the final season? with lazy writing? or taking audience for granted and forcing whatever the shit you write? HBO handbook  to fool audience
Ahhhhh here we go ❤️❤️❤️
this looks more like the witcher than game of thrones.
OMG, this looks fucking amazing... can't wait!!
Наконец-то!!!!! Я очень ждала!
anyone noticed the dagger 0:41
black targaryen? Is there something wrong
Oh yeah
Let's hope HBO don't brutally kill this like GOT.
Don't fuck up the ending this time
മലയാളികൾ വരട്ടെ 🔥🔥
I think they just recycled the Throne from original got
I wonder how long it will take for them to stuff this series up
Hope hbo max will be launch in india soon
🙂
I'm in!!
ok, now I'm hyped
It looks good. But I honestly still feel like H.B.O. made a mistake. The direction I think they should have went was to bring on Mr Martin as an advisor for the scripting and make a mini series about Roberts Rebellion.
Now my life has meaning
Everyone else:wow more book accuracy and more dragons  Me alone:DOCTOR
Опять ночью снимали?
Waaaaaaahhhh!!!! Can't wait!
Black Targaryen...you know, it's kinda racism too!  p.s.Martin Luther King was white (or not? Who cares!)! ©HBO
Just to be clear this ain’t fake right lol
Если в трейлере есть чернокожий в необоснованном антураже, значит сериал уже провалился.
WE WUZ VALYRIANS
Sheee can't Wait for it 😍
After the embarrassing ending of GOT, I'm most certainly not watching this. Just let it die.
So they r here to describe what real thrill is...
THAT THRONE 😍
Where is Khal 🙄
❤🔥🔥🔥
Wow !
Can these people also re-make Game of Thrones season 8, please? Dumb and Dumber ruined it completely.
Damn the Iron-Throne looks EPIC.
O M G !!!
Looks dope
I hope that isn't a black Targaryen
yes i can’t wait
00:00:19 Balerion is that you?
No dragon reveal 😭
*200 years ago*  Wasn’t that when George R. R. Martin said he’d have Winds of Winter finished by?
Ah....I see so these are Jon and Dany's predecessors. Looking forward to it.
that level 99 armor though😀
Waiting
Good effort on the iron throne re design HBO, but still about 3 meters short. A-
*aaaAAAAA Targaryen music intensifies*
Great casting choice :)
Well let's go back to Burlington Bar
Finally 😀❤
Let me ask about the ending of this.
Don't be shite , hopefully be better than season 7 and 8
It's crazy how a lot of people say that GoT already ruined this world for them so they have no interest in a prequel. I may have hated that sorry, incompetent, and embarrassment of an excuse for an ending too. But I promise I'll be one of the first ones watching this when it drops next year! 🐉🐉🔥🔥
Iron Throne is awesome 🔥
Y’all talking about the damn throne… what was that fight at mid trailer!!!
I'm setting my expectations low for this. Hoping to be wrong
Fezzes are cool!
Fool us once shame on you... I don't know anyone who is willing to watch this after what they let happen in Season 8 GoT.
കൊള്ളാം പൊളി സാനം
Prince Philipp going hard
OK just a reminder for in 6 seasons, DONT GET YOUR HOPES UP......... I can already hear the bells.....
HBO, PLEASE do not spoil this!
Most awaited
Here we go again, another 9 years of Game of Thrones
Season 8 trash fix
Can't wait anymore ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am crying 😭
Please launch HBO max in India cant wait for it❤
Already looks better than the entirety of season 8
Are people blind? The throne is the exact same as it was in the show, There’s just more swords around the steps.
Finally ned stark is back after getting stabbed in the first season
Dracarys.
It's all true. the lannister stole the iron throne. The iron throne is rightfully belongs to the Targaryens.
Making Valyrians black is still weird asf
Joffery Baratheon lack of air  Stannis Baratheon lack of hair  Robert Baratheon lacked an Air  House Velaryon too much hair
The only problem I see with the throne being like in the books is the continuity problem it causes between house of the dragon and GOT
This is going to absolutely suck, I read the Fire and Blood books and all the ASOIAF books and I'm a huge fan, but Martin for fucks sakes, you should have ended your books by now, who the fuck even cares about this when the main series sucked and the book franchise isn't even finished! And they are making a prequel?! This is just sad.
This... does put a smile on my face
Much waited 🔥
I hope Dumb & Dumber aren't involved in this
Ok HBO Max... You won. I subscribed for the Snyder Cut then cancelled when y'all said no more Snyderverse, I'll guess I'll get the app again when House of the Dragon drops, you'll get a few months out of me yet 😒
Did I hear Ramsay Bolton there? Dreams didnt make us kings
SCREAMING CRYING THROWING UP THIS IS GOING TO BE SO GOOD I JUST KNOW IT !!!! THANKYOU GRRM FOR GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS !!! THEY EVEN FIXED THE THRONE AND THE DIALOGUE SOUNDS GOOD !!!!
Please don't suck at finale HBO
Wow🔥
Oh my God.. Goosebumps 🔥
Geronimoooooo!!!
Matt Smith is about to remind people that Game of Thrones is still good.
Winter Is Coming 💥
If opening credits are any less epic than GoT, I’ll riot.
nah thanks
Hell yeah!! It's looking pretty good!
The Iron Throne’s looking mighty prickly 🔥⚔️🔥
Waiting 🖤
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did." Targaryens are coming!!
FUCKING CHILLS, that is all
I'm scared of another GOT S8 mess, but I'm crossing fingers
Ебоооооой 🤤
dont end this one like shit lol
2022 is a such a vague way of saying a date.  We need : The month, day  and the Time !!
Yyaa moohne
Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did🤯🔥
Holy shit
TAHGS fucking VISERYS WITH BLACKFYRE
I just hope D&D stay away from this.
Bangladesh 👈like দেন
OOOHHH YEAHHHHHHH
#RestoreTheAnyderVerse
Le Bran after hearing dreams didn't make us kings😂😂😂
Spoiler! This series with end with a rushed messy final season and leave a bad taste in your mouth!
LESSS FUCKIN GOOOOO
hopefully they stick closer to the book material, Battle of the bastards was AMAZING but the grand northern conspiracy in the books is still so much better overall.
who is directing and writing this?
MA BOAH MATT
This won't end badly cuz we already know how it ends.
Now of thare smart they could run this right through to Roberts rebellion
I see the dragons cg is not ready.
Encore du wokisme
Dr. Who moonlighting as a Targaryan.   I bet he has parked his Tardis somewhere in Flea bottom :P
ഇത് പൊളിക്കും🔥🐲🐲
The moment GOT theme song played in the bg, a rush came into the body is beyond!
Appreciating the more accurate throne, plus cinematography and fight choreography seem to be on point as well! Will watch for sure!
And now the dance begins...
So there are black targaryens now… lol
Think it can be epic don’t know if it’ll be great. I’d give it 30-45 episodes to tell the story.
Hodor
Perfect
We want hindi dubbed 🔥🔥💯😍
❤️🌏
Let the joust begins before i piss myself.
Is it Pedro Pascal's voice ..???
LETS GOOOO DUCK YEAH 🦆
I still don't get the appeal of prequels. I always rather see how the story moves forward
DON'T FUCK THIS UP
Kinda kills the mood knowing how the whole thing ended 🤣😆🤣🤣 they could do all that god kings fire blood bs, but the whole thing ended with "she's ma-queen!" and "i don't want it" 😆🤣🤣🤣
GOT fans: Don’t fuck this up.
I am waiting✨️✨️ മലയാളി  onddooii😂
NO WAY!!🤩😱
"Dreams didn't make us king... Dragons did" I'm sold.. 🔥🔥
Now finally something big here
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragon did." HOLY FUCKING SHIT.
Important note: the Game of Thrones showrunners are not involved in this in any way. Considering that, I'm so hyped for this show.
😌
Chase of iron throne begins. 🔥
This time... we have finished source material.
Fuck yea
Could have put this energy into seasons 7 and 8, but we’re not ready for that conversation.
Really excited for this regardless of how GoT ended! I'm currently reading the books and it's crazy how much more the world of a song and fire has to offer up in the big screen. Wonder how many other prequels they're gonna make.
Goosebumps My Fav house
Man it looks good but I hope the writing is
AAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!! 💕😱😂😱😱🥺💕😱🥺💕🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
🔥🔥🔥
All of this for bran becoming the king ? I'll pass
i'm sure i'm wrong but was that Ramsay narrating this????
What a beautiful thing to wake up to!!
Destruction is coming 😍
I am beyond excited for this.
the dogmatists are already out there
و كذا نقدر نقول ثاني أعظم مسلسل بعد قيم اوف ثرنونز
Things I'm waiting for- New intro Dragons The Politics Westeros future references of game of throne events  Some cool war moments Some emotional moments some satisfying moments and tons of surprises white walker if possible
welcome everybody to the creation of john snow.
Wow Daenerys vibe in this trailer
CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS. ITS GONNA BE EPIC🔥🔥🔥
Omggg it’s here 😭😭😭
can't wait to watch this live action of Yosuga No Sora
Ahhh... not gonna get hyped for a show that some Hollywood-Blockbuster writers are going to butcher eventually. Happened once and not again. We haven't forgotten HBO
😱
Come on, Where’s dragons???
This literally is 🔥
Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
bran is the night king
Nope. Still remember what you did with 8th season. Gtfo.
The reign of the Targaryens will begin..
I hope this time you wont disappoint us unlike 2019 season 8.
Don't ruin it like season 8 please 🐈
200 years before 🔥
Don’t shoot me but the targaryens were white not black… ‘pale of skin’…
DAMMM
How many of you noticed that the narration is by the most beloved Ramsey Bolton 🔥😂
YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally 🤍
Just by the first glimpse, i am sold!
its a sin for not telling the exact release date anger of old gods and new will rain on hbo
... 💥💥💥💥
Can't wait for the trailer breakdowns
That music at the begining though....💟
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Never was interested in Got but since Matt Smith is there, I might gonna binge it and ignore my overdue assignments!
This one-minute teaser is better than the entire season 8 of GOT
Iron Throne looks LEGIT 🔥
Да, негры таргариены. И азиатка. Спасибо хэбэо.
OoooOooohh!! My favourite inbred Dynasty after the Ancient kings of old Egypt.......and Dragons!  The Black Fella with the pure blonde dreads is a bit weird mind no disrespect to the fellow but you know Black Lads and Lasses come from the Summer Isles in Thrones huh!
If there is no black pansexual vietnamese dragon in this series its not woke and diverse enough and it should be cancelled
House of the Dragon is open till 10pm on the weekends and the buffett is only $9.99 on Sundays.
Let’s GOOOO!!! That hint of the Targ theme was everything. Always going to miss Dany tho
Shat all over the final season of GoT and expect people to be excited over this?
The Daenerys theme at the end T_T
so stoked to hear more epic music of House Targaryen from Ramin Djawadi!
I hope they dony copy season8 of got🤣
Nice
الفايت يعررررررب الله
If the script will be written by the same idiots, that wrote last 2 seasons of GoT, then it's not worth waiting
This looks like a big budget porn parody of game of thrones.
Any free fire lover here ❤️
Malluzzzzz undo
It's gonna be a fierce and grand competition between HoD and LOTR spinoff 🔥🔥
Lit
Who tf cares, everyone knows we're waiting for a LOTR series teaser/trailer..........
I am literally crying, help!
Whose story is this rhaegar or aegon
Water, fire, air and dirt...     Fucking magnets, how do they work?
Here we go again
They better have proper storyline for this. With people with more brain than that of a Squirrel, with lesser ego than before.
HBO max to be released in Australia as well. Or find a way to release the contents in Australia. Every other streaming site made it to Australia except HBO
#blackwashing
0:40 - ну чисто веларионы, какая же срань
when prince Phillip finally becomes king
👍
Daenerys Targaryen the one true queen
Looks promising tbh
Давно так ничего не ждал, как этот сериал!
absolutely perfect 🐉👑
Black Targaryen 😂😂😂
*ഇത് കത്തും🔥*
Nature is healing 💥
I'm so fucking hyped
HBO Max: Choose your plan Me: I choose dragons!
Repeat with me “ This time it ain’t shit like S8”  *Apology accepted*
I love how this looks more diverse! Just another reason to look forward to it
This looks dragony-wagony.
This bring back bad memories
Will be nice to see Geralt of Rivia cameo in there
0:17 ...a dragon or a statue of dragon ?  Balerion , is that you ?
Your trailer for GOT season 8nwas also well produced and look what we got. I'll pass. Or download.
hol up so you be sayin we wuz some velaryons n shit?
No dragons wtf are you fucking kidding me
Fooooook! Can't wait
To hell with the entire 8th season! I will never forgive the writers.
Was that 11th doctor? or just some Matt Smith look alike?
Just one request. Don't fuck this up like the way you fucked GOT. It broke my heart.
Fucking hyped for this... Let's gooo 🔥
"She ran away?" "Well yeah, one dragon can't stand up to a scorpion launcher."  " She burned down the town?" " Well yeah, scorpion launchers can't stand up to a dragon."
This is what happens when Prince Phillip never gets to be King. 😆
Isn't that Prince Philip from The Crown?
looks cool....i just don't have the same hype i used to have, then again maybe it's just me 🤷🏾‍🤷🏾‍🤷🏾‍
Matt Smith appearing in another documentary series about a royal family
Is that Robb talking?
🥳🥳🥳
It's 2021 and I'm still upset with that final season. I am done with everything GoT. HBO clearly doesn't value it as a story. Only as a paycheck.
I literally opened up the HBO max like 2 hours ago and this was the first thing that popped up. Cranked the volume all the way up.
Umm HELL YES?!
Actually dreams (of Daenys) and dragons did make you kings.
Please, for the love of god, don’t cock it up like you did the original series.
The sea king looks amazing!!!!!!
"No, Now it ends"
WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS?!
This is gonna be a thrilling one..
Hype
Don't know how to feel about this
Let the wincest begin.
OMG
This trailer >>>>>>>>>> the whole GOT season 8
Oh all of a sudden everyone likes Game of Thrones again huh? 😆  I never stopped liking it so I’m psyched for this show.
💞Waiting for 2022💞  🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
The Iron Throne...🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This will almost definitely be better than the final 4 seasons of GOT.
I aint watching this
Now that's the Iron Throne 👑
Cant be as bad as that last series of game of thrones anyway
Teaser be like - u will know nothing
What’s the point ? We all know it leads to absolute shit in 200 years.
this is gonna suck, seriously what do you expect after the shitshow thats was GOT post Season 5?
Espero que o final não seja tão decepcionante quanto o de GOT 😔
hopefully they dont butcher / rush the finalie
Omg epic !! Holy shit this looks good..
Already ruined Game of Thrones, I won't be fooled again!
FIRE!!!
What does it matter anyway?  We know it'll just lead up to that foul thing they could a final season anyway.  If this prequel show was good I think it'd just upset me even more knowing it's all for nothing but some lazy mess.
Targarien... nigga? WTF? Rastargarien? lol
Hey George, how about finishing your damn books like a professional instead of writing all this fan fiction, perhaps then those two morons Dan & Dave would have had legitimate material instead of their inept writing ability.
I think he will be great
Malayallikal ille makkalle 💕💓
THAT IRON THRONE THO  I mean it still doesn't compare to the book throne but holy heck what an upgrade
Please provide ringtone i love that background sound.any one have this please share link
Bullshit continues...
It's gonna be legen.... wait for it ......dary
Yeah the last season was botched. But the first few seasons are some of the greatest television ever. Let's hope this is more like the first few seasons.
🔥 🐉
The show will be as expected ☺️☺️
Abhi maja aaega naaaa biddduuuuuu🔥
House Blackfyre needs to be there. And perhaps some kind of tease in the end, about survival on of the male or female heirs. That would make series awesome.   Book feature a lot of hints about Blackfyre rebellion. All hail Blackfyre, a cadet branch of Targerian family.
Waiting... 🔥
Matt Smith is ❤️
I couldn't care less. I can't get into GOT again and the fact it's a prequel makes it even less interesting.
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
finally, something to look forward to
The Many Saints of King's Landing
Yess another show where I can spend 3hrs watching my reflection on the screen
Refusing to get excited until we know if this one will actually have an ending! P.s has he bothered to finish the other set of books yet or… we just gunna let the last trash heap of an ending stand?!?! Just curious? #LovedEverythingGOTOnce!
i still have a bad taste in my mouth from the season finale
OKAY WOW
9.99$ so expensive for Turkey.
Lets hope they dont ruin this one too...
Asian targarian, black targarian. This shit is gone to far
Hope this will make up for the ruined season 8
❤️❤️❤️
The redemption arc begins
black targaryens while targaryens are of white and inbred origin
The production doesn't look as good as thrones. And what's with the black Targaryen?
المتحمس ينطيني لايك واللي ممتحمس نقطه خاص ابلكه
Fuck yeah !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Plzz in indian dubbed hindi
After the abysmal last 2 seasons, no thanks.
❤️frm Kerala
we wuz kings
Hmm, white actors playing white people? Looking forward to triggered reviews.
Black targaryans? What.     Also 4 legs on the dragon? Really?
i’m so excited oh my
I wasn't a big fan of Game of Thrones (dropped it after season 3) but this looks quite intresting. And as a Doctor Who and Matt Smith fan I will be definitely watching it😁
Valar Morghulis
Gotta milk that franchise till it's bone dry.
Ohhh! It's Coming Again to rule
Looking forward to how they address those extra swords around The Iron Throne
😲💯🔥
girl at 0:30 reminds me of daenerys
I'm not aware about thia series but saw  11 and came over.. 😅😅
I pray there's some scenes or information detail anything about the night king and white walkers, the best villain we've seen in a long long time, cut down in his prime by a child. still angers me. something like you can destroy him and his army, but he's not dead
🌚THE THRONE🌝
Guys let's just give it a chance, it looks amazing .yesss the last season  of season 8 was SHIT but let's give this a chance before shooting it down lol .
The ending of GoT left such a bad taste in my mouth, I don't really care for this that much. I will watch it but I'm not hyped for it
It's the dance of dragons theme and the Iron throne looking the book for me
OMG 😳 "Dreams Didn't Make us Kings , Dragons Did" Goosebumps Level = 10000000000% 🔥
This story has a written ending so we can be rest assured they won’t botch it. Also, props to them for accuracy, purple eyes for Targaryens and an Iron throne that resembles the book very closely.
0:40 whose that?
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Waited for it soo soo long !!! Finally here to fill the void !
Imagine screwing up an ending so bad that you need to make a prequel.
Please do not fuck this one up! Will definitely give it a chance.
This show should be boycotted after the Game of Thrones finale fiasco, how can u let fans down like that so much? Absurd! Atleast remake the damn thing, new actors or whatever.
Can't wait to fall in love with this show and then have the worst final season that I end up hating the show entirely......
Will they fuck this up once again?
Inspiration and talent didn't make you do this show, capitalism and brainless fanboys did.
Meh
that iron throne is so accurate.
GOT Dragons are  Nothing Compared to LOTR ones
Ramsey voice over🔥
Coming India and GOT HINDI office  And house of The drogon also Hindi 🙏
Velaryon... xD Ok...
എന്റെ പൊന്നോ.......................💥
They’ll have to do many time jumps to get to the mad king
I WANT FIRE AND BLOOD!
I'm CRYING 😭😭😭
Bruhh I can’t wait for 2022
Only one request, please don't fuck this series season finale like GOT.
Let this be your redemption.
Time to run it back and try to salvage what those two ruined.
My only worry is that Matt Smith won't disappear into the role enough to make me forget he's also the Doctor.   And to the literal thousands of comments on it, Martin himself said the throne in got was due to not having the funds or the sets to have a more accurate one. I think they're starting with a slightlyyy larger budget this time around.
next year WE ARE EATING GOOD
Dopíči to je skvělý
HBO Don't Fucked it up again I beg you
Don't mean to be trivial but surely it's "A HBO original" not "An HBO original" 🤔
Ah shit, here we go again....
So this is gonna last for another 10 fukin years or what?
Dragons are to HBO what the avengers are to Marvel
Holy Sh*t…I can’t wait!! 🔥🐉🔥
Christ, I cant watch the earlier main seasons anymore with how tarnished the show is now. Those final seasons just left way too much of a foul taste in my mouth.  A prequel certainly ain't going to rewrite its wrongs.  Nah, think this is a pass from me.
This loooks greeeaaatttt....but like Liam Neson said....if You ruin this ...."i Will find u...and i Will kill You" :P
Can someone tell me if the source material for this is complete? Because I don't want another season 6-8 of GoT.
Wait is over ✌️
AND THIS SHOW IS GONNA SHOW US AT LEAST 17 DRAGONS!
Good finally
You allowed those awful writers to ruin Game of Thrones. I Refuse to watch this.
In 0:24, is this blackfyre or dark sister ?
Anthada 18+ scene indavo
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The lion, the wolf. the dragon   Epic
THIS IS BETTER THEN GAME OF THRONES
They should be glad they didn't have Euron Greyjoy back then, one shot from the giant crossbow and a dragon falls in the ocean.
Malayalies undo
When you are just scrolling on youtube and you find this trailer 🤗
Name a show that was better than the original series?  "House of the Dragon"  Edit: Its now 2024, 3 episodes into Season 2 and it has not disappointed one bit.
മല്ലൂസ് ആരും ഇല്ല...?? 💥
The story of Eigen targerian 🤔
Ohhhh mein Gott 😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️♥️
0:34 Is that Matt Smith?! The Doctor is now a Targaryen!!
GODS. KINGS. FIRE. BLOOD INDEED! 2021 is sort of already over. Can we just skip to 2022?
Nope sorry not forgiven for the end of GoT. Need another decade
Game of thrones is back to rule again....  Hell yeahhh...  Lets fucking gooooo
how come the show revolves around dragons and there aren't any to be found in the trailer???? nice redesign of the throne :)
Also known as "How to milk a franchise into oblivion"
❤️
oque esse matt smith é LEÃO de fazer serie é loucura, o cara não cansa de ser indicado para o emmy
I just wanna time travel to 2022 now. I wasn't ready for this 🔥
Omg let’s goooo!!!
Nice 🔥🔥🔥
I'm Tired
I just hope Dumb and Dumber keep their dirty hands off this show.
Dear GRRM, please don’t let them ruin this show
Oh god
давным давно, во времена драконов и негров
If only actress Saoirse Ronan could be cast in a prominent character role in these GoT spin-offs...she looks like she belongs in Game of Thrones. She has the acting chops and the kind of old-young look that suits the historical 'period' vibe of the show
Dracarys
"Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did"  chills.
oonmmmmmmfffggg
I hope they do a show about Roberts rebellion and leads into The Greyjoy rebellion that leads into GOT
Looking forward to watching this show.  Not looking forward to everyone bleaching their hair after watching this show.
Let's gooooooooooo 🔥🔥🔥
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #RestoreTheBatFleck
Now I know where the thousand swords of the Iron Throne are. It's bigger on the inside!
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #RestoreTheBatFleck
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse #RestoreTheBatFleck
DRACARYS!
So let me get this straight.  They went to the trouble of making the Iron Throne book accurate but they drastically changed the incredibly plot important House Velaryon....  ....mmmkay
Guess we'll learn the original owner of the Catspaw dagger that used to kill the Night King 0:41
Fuck yeah we are waiting for this moment a long time 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Raggedy Targaryen
I was not readyyyy! Just seeing that throne makes me wanna cry 🥺😂 I'm happy they've made it more book-like!
We wuz kangs
MATT SMITH LOOKS SO GOOD
Matt Smith THE DOCTOR, came to save the Game Of Thrones universe!!!!
Hopefully it makes up for the god awful final season of Game of Thrones.
dont think ive ever seen matt smitch looking so serious
200 years before disappointment.
0:37 The Targaryen sigil must have 2 legs btw. It's called "Wyvern" 0:14 Nice spoiler. Looks good, but we already know the shit ending of the original, so...
love❣ from India 🇮🇳
Vooooo 🔥😌😌😌😌
Aahh shit here we go again
Please dubb in hindi language ?
here before 200k ✊
can't wait!
🔥🔥🔥
Hopefully HBO doesn't try to go all "Woke" with the new series.
Letsss gooooo!!!
matt smith????
So do they have enough money to have more than 3 dragons on screen or what.
А чего черные такие?
🤩😎😍
🤩😎😍
I'm just wondering how they plan on ruining this one.
At least they can’t fuck this up, right?  They have the ending on paper…
Dracarys !!!
aww aint that cute, Dr Who doing cosplay
As long as David and Dan are not involved than we won’t have a game of thrones (which sucked from beginning to end) on our hands
A tv series about a bunch of albinos that like to pork their own siblings.
Waiting to hear the music scores of Ramin Djawadi 🎶✨
Ok you got me
This better be not something like GOT S8 😌
That track..  ❤❤
Really?  After the clusterfuck that was GOT ending... this still makes many of you 'hyped'? It doesn't make you go "here we fucking go again with this dead horse"? How can any of this be of any value when you know how disgracefully atrocious the ending is?   I am genuinely baffled by your reactions. I truly wish I was this easily excited, so quick to accept failures as something to look forward to. I envy you.  Let me give you an analogy:  Say you are served a massive dinner. It starts off amazing but you realize that as more food is bought out,  you start noticing it is laced with horse shit and piss and drunk people's puke.  By the end, you are being served literal manure and piss and puke. There is no trace of actual food left.  THEN they come and say to you "bro wanna see how we grew all the food and made the preparations?.... FOR THAT SHIT AND PISS AND PUKE WE EVENTUALLY SERVED YOU?   General population: "HELL YES! Can't wait to see what was done before the SHIT, PISS AND PUKE we got served. I am hyped!!!!!"
You make my day ❤️❤️❤️
Dreams didn't make us kings dragons did🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The new iron throne looks sick!!!!!!!
*Dracarys* 🔥
Hyped 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dragons did.
Yeeeeeeessssssssss
Fucking political correctness!!!!!black targaryen!!!!  Like black Achilles in Troy!!! What is your problem?
🔥Epic Is Back
Nobody gives a shit, bring  back Littlefinger !!!!!!!!!😩
Black Targaryen huh?
I hope it's not some wokeshit
I like that you can slighty hear the Targaryen music theme, wich i also Hope will be same tones for the intro.
Aah the north remembers that Aegon Targaryen meant nothing, now there's another chance
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
I can't wait anymore..🥺🔥
1 question. Will this fix the problems with GoT? If not I don't care about this show because all it does is give a new beginning to GoT and the beginning of GoT was never a problem.
Prince Philip😍😍😍
HOW COULD BE VALIRIANS AFROMAN???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Need a dr who cross over 🔥
OH MY GOD.. THEY WILL SHOWING US AS EARLY AS THE RED SPRING!! I Can't.. I just can't
Chills everywhere
Fire and Blood 🔥
Interesting choice. Matt Smith is a very good actor, however I don't think he really fits Daemon's description as "inhumanly beautiful". I mean maybe it's just me, but I don't consider him very fitting with that description.
We got Targaryens that are Summer Islanders now somehow?
2022😍🔥
💥💥💥
Woahhhh
We still need a remake of season 8 though.

DREAMS DIDN'T MAKE US KING, DRAGONS WILL
Ждём
"omg forced diversity woke garbage waaaaaaaaaahh"
no dragon in teaser Why?
king in the north 🌚🌝
This makes me feel like frodo at the end of the lord of the rings. Some wounds never heal. season 8 is one of them. This awesome new season is being made, but not for me.
Fire and Blood🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unintresting!!!!!! and dead befOre it begins ......  THE COW IS DRY ,HBO!!!!!!!
Targaryen history is absolutely crazy and beautiful and terrifying all at the same time!
മലയാളിസ് assemble⚡⚡
Will this have a shit season 8 too?
Okay. It’s official. There has been enough time since GoT ended for me to let myself be excited about this.
Blackfyre and Dark Sister! Two of the most legendary swords in ASOIAF lore!! 🔥🔥
The REAL IRON THRONE guys this is promising....this is Fantastic))))) exceeded expections..............
Can't wait for it⚡⚡⚡
Hell yeahhhhh ❤️❤️
Ehhh …. Who cares ….
❤️
I hoped for an older Daemon (Mads Mikkelsen) but let’s wait and see
ААААААААААААААААААААААААА НЕУЖЕЛИ МЫ ДОЖИЛИ ДО ЭТОГО? НАДЕЮСЬ ЭТО НЕ ФЕЙК
0:40 the whole fam is dripping that 'bmf' walk this going to be so cool.
Черный Таргариен - самый каноничный канон 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

A Time Lord with Dragons! Yes!
Finally winter is coming GOT

Still waiting for the big sword duel between Jon Snow and the Night King
Malayalis like adichitaa pokuvaa
holy shit.. winter is coming 200 years earlier!
Dare I be tempted by a new GOT show...
This made my day 🥰🥰
Heard this was out and literally run out of class to watch it... Writing  you from headmaster's office
I can't wait till you give up on the show on season three
Can't wait for this one. . .
başarılı iş. alırım bi dal..
" Dreams didn't make us king, dragons 🐲did "  :)
YES
Really thought they'd show atleast one dragon
House of the Hype-on
If they will make a series from conquest of westeros to the bitter brutal war with dorne ,blackfyre rebellion up until Robert's rebellion. They might redeem themselves and then release a film that would remake season 8
After how badly they shit the bed on season 8, does anyone even care about this franchise any more?
I’ll watch but there better be a lot of dragons 🐉
Yesssssss finally
So I’m booked for 2022 and upcoming years😁
The Bgm is epic  Can't wait for this much anticipated  Show 🙏🏻🙏🏻
വെയ്റ്റിങ് 🔥
Me: Oh, great a Game of Thrones spin-off... After season 8 they have a lot of work to do before I get excited about this...... OMFG, MATT SMITH! GIVE ME A FUCKING RELEASE DATE ALREADY!
രണ്ടായിരത്തി ഇരുപത്തി രണ്ട്
Wtf
Henry Cavill would've made a better Daemon Targaryen.
Yesss!!! get yourself excited guys.
🔥🔥🔥
Ghad Daymn!! Now that is a throne I can fight to seat on...
why does Emilia look different
Wasn't expecting the it but still super excited!
colors are looking vibrant..and yeah..amazing.. after seeing the trailer... excitement on another level..
This trailer gave me goosebumps, can’t wait for show😁😁
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!
Goosebumps! Hardly recovered from PTSD from GOT! Everything just came back!
so this what it feels like, trusting and hoping once again after betrayal and heartbreak. okay lets go
GOOSEBUMPS
no thanks, last season was enough for me. fool me once..
Yeah boi! Lets go!!!!
Disney+ kiddie service about to feel the true wrath of swords, sandals, and incest.
too many ´´summer islanders´´
🔥🐉🐲
Hunger games logo)
This is gonna be epic!
well hot damn, I am psyched for this show!
Stumbled upon this trailer... Loving the line" dreams didn't make us kings , Dragons did"
As mad as i am about season 8 i am willing to give this show a chance, i hope it doesn't disappoint, if it is good we can just pretend the last 2 seasons of GOT didn't exist and instead they did a new season where they went back in time
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
please dont fuck this up again
did i just heard Ramsey Bolton 🤔.
0:08 A HBO Original Series* Bit of a typo there....
The cinematography already  looks better that any show since Games of thrones s8
Fuckkkk yeahhhhhhh
Omg omg omg omg omg
You can be anybody you want to be! If you have a dragon.
I been waiting so long for The Dance of Dragons.
Hot Pie's grandad or it's a pass from me.
Ля, что они сделали с Веларионами? Это древний и прекрасный дом, в чьих жилах течёт кровь древней Валирии. Они, как и Таргариены сохранили характерные черты валирийский внешности, а именно фиалковые глаза,серебристые волосы и СВЕТЛУЮ КОЖУ. Таргариены не признавали брали с другими домами Вестероса, только Веларионов для сохранения чистоты крови. Если Мартин принимал участия в создании сериала, как он это допустил.
Gods, kings, fire and disappointment
I have my hopes up. D&D are gone. The source material is good. This is already looking good.
All these people freaking about Matt Smith. I don’t get it. Doctor Who and its acting is always SO bad. I feel like everyone took thr LSD but me, I’m definetely missing out on something I can’t see.  Olivia cooke though? I’ll be there for her
Please don't ruin the end of the series this time 😒
Aí meu Deus, vou morrer
sigh typical prolog shit
I want to see a proper Dance of the Dragons
Never watching this garbage
Snikers Targarien hahhahhahhaahhahahaahHAHAHAHAHAH
Looks like it's going to be better than the last 2 seasons of GOT
#RestoreTheSnyderverse
I just busted
shut uppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp. Missed u land of game of thrones
Onnum parayan illa poli sanam
Meu coração vai sair pela boca
Dragon and fire looks like Mortal Kombat )
*screams incoherently*
Better not kill my favourite hero this time.😆
IM SOOO EXCITED!!
I dont read the books but was that a black Targaryen at 0:38?
This doesn't change what you've done
Dreams didn't make us king but the dragons did
Yaaaaas
Don't mess this up?
ي رب طلع ممتاز
Now that’s more like iron throne 🔥😍
IDK about this one cheif. The pain still hurts from the last season of GOT
IT'S MATT SMITH LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Lol @ everyone who was crying that Matt Smith is there. He looks amazing.
Actually hyped for this! I’ve missed Westeros. Gonna push aside how GoT ended, and look forward knowing that this series already has a set ending.
Ok...but where are the dragons? People in wigs it's not a very thrilling tease.
തീ 🔥🔥 വേറെ ലെവൽ 🔥🔥🔥
Making. ⚡⚡❣️❣️❣️❣️
😱😱😱😱
why you have to reminds me about s8?
YES YES YEEEEEEEEES
Every episode is directed by Miguel Sapochnik, the man who directed Battle of the Bastards and Winds of Winter. Legend.
РА СИ ЙА !!!
Please make sure to have a better ending then the original one.
They'll fuck it up at the ending. Waste of time.
Its reall?
The Past
Dare I get my hopes up after GoT season 8?
Fly. In air
Enfin!!!!!❤❤❤
Not gonna lie this trailer be looking type boss 😎👍
തീ തീ തീ 🔥
Geronimo!!!
I was lowkey expecting a dragon scene at the end.
Not interested in anything this series has to offer after GoT ending I know it will just end in disappointment.
I sincerely hope this can fill the hole left in my heart from Game of Thrones
guys we know it is going to be good It has a beginning and ending to the story
OMG 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Meanwhile GOT - Season 1-7 didn't make us losers Season 8 Did
The normies will love this I’m sure
This looks amazing.
Oookkkaay
Waooooo omgg....yess
Ohh I didn’t know game of thrones was still a thing
Disney should take some lesson from this and gives us Star wars old republic show or something.
Nope. No one cares.
0:41 I spy with my little eye the Valyrian Steel Catspaw Dagger
HAIL HOUSE TARGARYEN 🔥🐉
I really want to but I just can't get excited for this. Still trying to process my grief over season 8.
!!!!!!!
Wow this is so diverse...
But where is the fucking dragons 🐉🐉
Yaa monee😍
Why Do People hate S8 of GOT ?
sheeesh
Been here up to a million views)
This is bad... Terrible casting, the iron throne who looks like a horrible fanservice mix between books and show and the dragons... Where exactly are the dragons? They had budget issues for Dany's 3 CGI dragons in the original show, how are they going to animate dozens of dragons in this new one? Don't let the catchy phrases fool you, this might be the beginning of a disaster.
Dracarys 🔥
💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥
😍🤯🤯
wow goosebumps
It begins.
That got bgm gave me goosebumps 🔥🔥
hope it's better than last GoT season
Jon snow: I want it.
Только попробуйте выпустить дерьмо!
Last time something dropped this hard Japan Surrendered
LETSSS GOOOOOOOO
Ok my hype for Game of Thronse is back
new doctor who episode looks awesome!
It will take a while to attach with these characters because we are too much attached to the og ones
I wonder how they’re gonna explain the iron throne looking bigger here than much later.     Maybe some other dragon before Drogon tried to burn it down in anger & managed only half the job?     Maybe Aegon the dragonbane was so disgusted by his family slaughtering each other over a throne & tried to melt it down & was stopped halfway by his guards & courtiers.
Yoooooohhh!!! 😭
Is that Richard Madden's voice I'm hearing?
I hope they understood that what we love about Game Of Thrones are the politics, strategies and not the action sequences
House Of The Wieners   But seriously, looks badass!
THE THRONE IS SO WELL DONE, OMFG. I'M SO EXCITED, I'M GONNA CRY.
Looks good. Hope D&D are not even allowed to contact any staff member in any way,shape or form.😬
Apparently the 11th Doctor had some adventures of which we had no idea. ;-)
Old days are coming.
Dont do the night king dirty in this one
😍😍😍❤️
Get ready for Dracarys 🔥
w t ffffff
Didn’t expect to see the 11th Doctor ! Cool!
Not one 🐲... In preview boo!
I thought this was a fan made video looking at the thumbnail.. atleast promote the teaser
Lol No  who still even cares?
Will watch if and when the series is done and has an IMDB score of 7+, then being beyond the possibility of being betrayed by HBO again...
Why does the throne look different with all the extra swords on the floor?
❤❤🔥🔥
Wtfffffffffff🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Hype already 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope HOD will try to wash off the sins make by season 8
🔥
Looks awesome
I don't give a shit about game of thrones but by god do I give a shit about dragons
My hopes are up. Please don't crush them.
Who cares, Game of Thrones ended like shit.  All this for nothing
Who has a better story to tell than balerion the black dread
ahhhhhhhhh i  need more
Starbucks. Soon 😂
🤯💥🔥
Can't wait... feel like to many people have been down on it b/c of the ending but I'm looking forward to watching GOT on Sunday nights again.
Dreams didn't make us king dragons did  Blown 🤯🤯🤯
Hopefully they have new directors
Скоро на всех трекерах страны с озвучкой от 1эксблят!
i had no interest for GOT, but this i wanna watch
oh shit, the throne is more accurate
Matt Smith my man 🔥
Bro they didn’t even try. Wtf is that title 😂
RHAENYRA AND DAEMON LOOK SO GOOD TOGETHER OH MY GOD
HADİ BAKIYIMM ! ! !
My comment is the 504th. I am All time GOT fan and you don't know how much happy i am after release of this promo. Me and my friend's thought GOT prequel is just a myth. let's hope this comment will be there and liked 10 years later too ♥️ #GOT #house_of_the_dragon #love
Can't 2022 come earlier...? I have chills and everything!! Time to reread Fire and Blood!! 🔥
When it releasing in india???
2022 год стоит того чтобы это увидеть.
woooowwwwzerrrrr..its comminggggggggggggg
Just hope that it beats game of thrones and importantly breaking bad
Just when I was about to say I miss GoT 🤭
Dreams Didn't Make Us Kings....!!  DRAGONS Did🔥🐉  Time To Create History.....!! House Of The Dragons💎
Только не негры-валирийцы, только не это!
Не подведите только, сделайте нормально и жёстко
IM here for it. Good timing
Build an army to defend this TV series otherwise this will end up like GOT season 8.
If this goes woke I'm going to be so mad
வெரே லெவல் ❤️ GOT
No question about it. I'm ready to get hurt again.
Wow, I didn't expect it to be that good! Still hope there will be (at least in flashbacks) Aegon and his sisters. But Dance of Dragons - just as exciting! Matt Smith looks awesome - very Targaryen look. So waiting for the premiere!!! (never thought that I'll become that big fan of GOT world, all thanks to the prequel stories of the Seven Kingdoms)
I don't know if I can trust this after the shitty ending of the GoT
Now drop Tlou teaser and we're good 🥰
Well, can't be as bad as the last seasons. I'm in.
Just keep the bad writers as far as possible away from this. Thank you.
I don't know about the dragons but am sure that more incests are coming...😅
Афровалирийцы...мдэ. Не жду ничего хорошего
🤩😍
We are waiting for that moment💥💥🤩
Freaking AMAZING. I knew Matt would have been perfect. I knew it.
🐉💥
Goosebumps... Feeling sad for danerys targaryen death⚰...
omg its happening!
They used the Targaryen theme song.. So powerful..
Just please don’t let us down 🙏🏿
I already know that I’m gonna absolutely LOVE this!!!
😯🔥
Can't wait to see the tardis!
Powereshhhh🤙🏻💥
Cool.  But Winds of Winter is what we all want
Йеее!!!! Ура!!!! 🐲🔥
Ну ну если будет на уровне 7-8 сезона ИП ,репутацию потеряете.
It's fuc*ing awesome😃😃
Yesssssssssss😍😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍
😍😍🥰
🔥😍🥰
❤️❤️❤️
Damn damn damnnnnn!!!!!!!!! the last line was awesome! "Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did. "
Толлерантный трейлер🤣🤣
Before even starting to watch the first eposide: I need a guarantee that D&D will not be allowed to write any of the episodes, ever.
😍😍🔥
😍😍🥰
This brings back PTSD of Tyrion saying "Who has the best story?" and Bran saying "Why do you think I came all this way?"   GoT's season 7 & 8 leaves a nasty stain on all future products. I go hesitantly, reluctantly, and with great apprehension.
Yoooo Ramin Djawadi kept the Targaryen/Dragon's theme !!!
🔥🥰😍
😍🥰🔥
Fire & Blood babayy!!
House Velaryon is of Valyrian descent, and its members often have Valyrian features, such as silver hair, purple eyes, and pale skin. A Feast for Crows, chapter 12 This is gona be season 8 Quality of writing.🤣
😍🔥🔥
🥰😍😍
😍😍🥰
حماس ابعلي
Alright but why should we care given how it all ends?
Let's goooo I can't wait !!! House Targaryen 4ever ! <3
Yall gone fuck this up like the final season! I hope yall prove us wrong and get your best story tellers!
After the cheap King of the Night and the whole plot of the last seasons?  No thanks. Goodbye HBO!
Cautiously optimistic
0:45 goosebumps 🔥
മലയാളീസ് 🙌🏻🤗
AEEEE CARAAALHO, ESSE SIM É O TRONO DE FERRO QUE QUERIAMOS VER 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Why they do this? Why you give me hope?   😭 Please, don't disappoint!
♥️♥️
Wow
Just don't disappoint us
Guys we dont have d&d right ?
This obviously takes place after Aegons Conquest and the death of Balerion. But it would be sweet to get a glimpse, perhaps a flashback of both of them.
Dragons? This is a reference to the game Skyrim.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🤯🤯🤯🤯
Finally
2022 will be 🔥  The Lord Of the Rings   House Of The Dragon  Better Call Saul - Final Season   Stranger Things - Season 4  Doctor Strangr in the Multivers of Mafness  Outlast Trails Game  World Cup 2022
I hope George RR martin is part of the team in true sense.
то есть встратых последних сезонов игры престолов не хватило? :))
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this made the main series like it's the prequel.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow 🔥❤️
Holy Shitt😱
WE WUZ
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Guys! PLEASE DON'T fuck it up this time please i beg of you sir...have mercy!
Robb Stark is narrating this?
We want justice for the last two seasons first. You wasted a series that would have gone down as one of the best in the history of tv.
Gosh, I'm so ready!!!!
🗣 It's happening y'all 😭😭🙌🏼
I will wait until all seasons are out. I don't want to be disappointed like a was with Game of Thrones' ending again.
Welcome يبوييييييييي
Glad I didn’t read the books. I’m ready to be surprised.
🙋
😁💘😄😃😀
I’m literally screaming I jumped out of bed and stumped my toe 🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉 burn them all!!!!!! Dreams didn’t make us kings Dragons did!!!!!! I can’t wait! I have never loved a series more!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally
goose pimples ra ayya 🔥
At least it looks better than wheel of time trailer 😭
Malayalees like adi
The last bgm chills my spine🔥
The most important question is have you hired screenwriters that don't suck?
I hope there will be at least someone from the north... Whole teaser trailer is full of blondies!
Gods, Kings, Fire, and blood. Dreams didn't make us kings Dragons did.
OMG😲😲..I can't wait
Cringe
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Malayaalees undo ivde 😁
This definitely has my attention!
Клим Жуков и его друг, расхуярят это
Going to be hard not seeing the Doctor in this role
Wow the throne looks so freaking badass
Time for the return of fire 🔥 make yourself under dungeon
Where are the fookin dragons???  🐉
"Dreams didn't make us king..Dragons did" I'm done🔥🖤
That black dude who is black only for the pc is still the weak point of the show, but the rest looks good.
മലയാളി ഇല്ലെ ഇവിടെ 🔥
I'm just gonna make this simple House of the Dragon looks epic!! The Dragon snarl at the end gave me chills!! I absolutely cannot wait for 2022!!
I hope that HBO spent some time developing a good story.. We all know what happened when they didn't have a story and threw a bunch of visuals to wrap up their flagship show.
Matt Smith! My Favourite Doctor
Black Targaryens? I cannot wait for this universe to be explored!
Yeah, babyy....
What the Iron Throne should’ve looked like
Holy shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who's the black bloke with the white dreadlocks? I have read the books several times, never heard that description? It seams rather unique for me to miss it? New character?
Wake me up when Winds of Winter drops
Matt Smith is absolutely fantastic!Perfect for the role.
based
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked
Can't wait to see how you fuck this one up.
AHHHHH
They gotta do a lotta things different if they wanna get out of GoT's shadow.
I am so hyped for this! Matt Smith is an amazing actor!
The final season was so bad that I don't feel like watching any spin off.
No Mushroom, No Party!
Trash like shit of thrones
Y'all gotta remember that this show actually has a massive amount of source material with "Fire and Blood", and the fuckers that ruined the show are no longer involved. This should be a good show.
Can’t wait for this, always love me some dragons. I’ll watch it trying to separate it completely from GOT and its horrendous final season, as if they aren’t even from the same universe. Shouldn’t be hard to do considering none of GOT’s wasted characters will be mentioned in this show.
Literally refuse to watch due to GOT
Fire will come
💥
okay, HBO, black Velaryon... So when i got TV-Show about black Hitler?
i cant believe they cast matt smith as Daemon Targaryen Daemon was a ruthless cunning warrior with an appetite to bloodshed, women and power i just cant see the good hearted silly Doctor Who playing this character as i imagined it
Wow this look much better than I expected!
Одиноко чувствую себя среде англикашек
Game Of Thrones Fans Assemble⚡️❤️🔥
Nice Witcher S2 Trailer
1:18 starbucks cup!
❤️❤️❤️
Yaaa mone 🔥🔥
Oh ❤️🔥
0:24 was that suppose to be Blackfyre?  Design seems nice; except for the pommel, I like it.   Seems like thay added more swords in the Iron Throne, not as much as in tha books but this is nice as well.   I see a lot of people bluntly speaking about their disinterest in this series because of the latter seasons of Game of Thrones. Stop lying to yourself. You know deep down you'll still watch it.
Hope it would be greater than GOT 🔥🔥⚡⚡
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Are there actually people watching this shite?
Let’s GOOOOO
anyone else not care about westeros as much as an ENTIRE series on everywhere in essos and even sothoryos? Imagine watching the rise and fall of valyria bcz of the volcanos. Or the era of Yi Ti. Or farther east where all the creepy supernatural creatures and beings live. Imagine a large crew of settlers sailing to sothoryos only to find the horrors that happened to settlers before them.....all the beasts and dragons and disease and different species of people.   We've had 8 seasons of westeros already. We don't need to see ancient westeros as much as mysterious and deadly essos/sothoryos.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
The Iron Throne 🔥
Vera level waiting
Fuck it IM IN hbo bout to be fire again Thrones & last of us 👀
Alright! Team Alicent Hightower lezzgo 🙌🏻 #HouseHightower
О святые семеро
Nice
LOOKS FUCKING AWESOME 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
High in the halls of the Kings who are gone....
Game of thrones left such a bad taste in my mouth I’m not even a little excited about this show.
And so it begins..
Amazing , Can't wait for the show already ❤️
Where are my GoT Northmen/women? Targs at King's Landing = boring af :-(
Hey remember that show that was the best show on television until they completely fucked up and destroyed the ending and made everybody hate or forcibly try forget about? Well it’s back in a prequel that you, especially now, won’t watch or give an absolute flying fuck about either.
It's Coming 🥰
Best show ever
UNDE-S ROMÂNII MEI? 🔥🔥💙💙
Yeeees! They made the throne look like THE THRONE!
so hyped for this! Matt Smith is gonna be amazing :D
Help, why I am excited
Should have started from aegon the conqueror's story
OMG it here ladies and gentlemen
🐐
Why is the series looks cheapest and b-grade
Sick! Can't wait for this!
Super Excited .
I hope it's better than the final season got
THROUGH FIRE AND BLOOD!!!
يا اخوان وش العظمه اللي شفتها قبل شوي؟
Finally 🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if Matt Smith is playing a bad guy.
>book accurate iron throne >Fire and Blood source material >No D & D  Yeah I think we're onto a winner here boys
I am eagerly waiting for This Epic Series
Still have a bad taste I my mouth from the GOT finale, but in spite of that I'm hyped for this hope it delivers
Okay.. can you just please let us all know in advance if the last season of this is gonna be shit?  So that it’d be easier for us to take decision whether to watch or not? Thanks
In whose reign will the story start with? Aegon's? There is Daemon so a dance of the dragons? I so want to watch Jaehaerys's reign too.
Just when I thought I was out… they pull me back in.
"Dreams didn't make us kings, dragons did. " Fucking goosebumps already.
I love so much fantasy, Game of Thrones in particular, I hope all expectations come true!
Im crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
What in the name of who
Waiting ⏳💥🔥🔥🔥
Whats the use now. Why now. After the way they ended things and now using targaryen name for money. 'Fallen throne' that wasnt really what the audience hoped
Shut up and take my money.
So many bad wigs so little time
മലയാളിസ് ഇല്ലാതെ എന്ത് ആഘോഷം
HOLY SH*T 👀🔥
Fire will reign #fireandblood
Europe when?
Drackaries 🔥🔥🔥
Why does the narrator sound like Ramsay Snow?
Again into the theories world. Did anyone bring any new theory watching this. Is there any child of prophecy, a azhor ahai 😂
I'm really hoping that this isn't like the "You are my queen " stuff that ruined a good show.
Danaerys this is for you 😭
PLEASE RELEASED HINDI DUBBED  INDIAN 🇮🇳
DnD not involved? Ramin Djawadi back as composer? Yeah okay I'll bite. Can't be worse than s8 💀
Hope the ending aint utter shit! hehe
Didn't expected the iron throne to look that good. It actually resembles the one from the books. Now I'm looking foward for this
Story is already written. No way they're gonna f this up right? Right??
0:37 that armor
Looking forward to see hell lot of dragons😍
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
30,000 views in 30mins of release at 2:30 at night.......holyfuck
Which month, please tell😭😭🔥🔥🔥
The Targaryens were not black wtf is this mess? 😂
lol getting Trivium's in the court of the dragon vibes
Are you sure you ain't kiddin'?
😍 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goddammit I'm invested all over again
زبالة جديدة 😍😍🔥🔥
Goosebumps
sooo excited 😍
Was hoping to see a dragon. Anyway, Fire will reign
Wow....🔥   Dragons Make everything 🐉
I really wanted that Westeros again.No other series filled that gap
The music gave me chills.
I cant wait for it  2022 come fast....
Promisings .........................
Another clusterfuck? No thanks, you've already fooled me with the last season.
Prince Daemon
I legit creamed my pants.
Make game of thrones shitty again!
Corlys Velaryon is looking badass! And properly extravagant for a someone who's accumulated as much wealth as he has through his travels. Can't wait to see my favorites though, the Lions of the Rock!
please hbo just say that the last season of game of thrones was not canon
Behold the best series in history coming... 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I love thrones all seasons
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
ooooooooooohhhh shitttt 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😮😮😮😮😮😮
Daily reminder what d&d did to all us fans. This looks fucking sick and hopefully redeems what they ruined!
Was that Idris Elba I saw...?
Finally there is a competitor for GOT
I am excited
Is that Matt Smith? Gotta support the local boy!  Looks great
I can’t wait 😫
I mean, mainly excited because the 2 idiots aren’t running the show anymore.
YEAH
Malayali 🙌🙌🙌
Waiting laye veri aaguthu da.... ❤️ Tamilans...
More book accurate iron throne!? YES FUCKING PLEASE
Hope HOD wont bottle like GOT Season 8
HBO IN THE MOOD TO DROP NUKES TODAY! 🐉
Kudos for trying to make the Iron Throne a bit more book-accurate
FIRE BORN
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Low key excited
speechless
I really hope this series delivers and live outside GoT’s shadow. It looks quite interesting
That’s what I’m talking about!!! But you should do something for Game of Thrones like Netflix does with Witcher.  Make an event for HBO Max and its shows like DC Fandome for DC.
Wowowowowowowowowwowowo...  Dreams didnt make us kings Dragons did 💥💥💥
Hopefully this time the creators don't have to work on Star Wars when the 8th season rolls around.
I'm watching only if GRRM is involved😤
😮🔥
For the love of God I really hope this turns out really well
I've never been more excited! 🔥
This is gonna end in tears again. U were warned
cringe
I WISH I COULD BE HAPPY BUT THAT UGLY SMITH WILL NEVER BE DAEMON FOR ME. IF I ARISE TO SEE IT, WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT, IT WILL JUST BE TO SEE HOW EMMA WILL SHUT UP MOUTHS, BECAUSE I TRUST HER, NOTHING ELSE.
I want the Targaryen to have purple eyes, plz make happen HBO
I don’t remember Targaryens having black skin what a joke
Фу негры не канон
I SCREAMED
0:41 hyped for Ready Targaryen One
Finaly something am anxious to watch.
Wait do they have 7 episodes to speedrun the story again? Smh
Is that Matt Smith ??? Does 11th travel through time and space to be a Targaryen ? Can't wait for this ambitious cross over.
Jon Snow is still the best character
പൊളി sanam 💥
Finally 🐉🔥🔥🔥
Мать моя ватрушка какое говно
Knowing how game of thrones ended this doesn't create much hype with me. It would be great of after this series they try again with a game of thrones remake where everything that happened from season 5 on is changed
پشماممممممم
This one minute video is already better than the entirety of Season 8
I'M SO EXCITED🥳
അമ്മേ.... തീ🔥🔥
I still cant feel excited about any of the spinoffs .I cant get over the ending🤧
written by..
All y’all talking about the end of GoT, you are gonna watch this show.
Aatt 🔥🔥
If you are going  to ruin the last season of this series too, just let me know I won't start watching it. I have enough disappointment in my life after got ending.
Lets gooooo
I trust HBO will deliver on this series but I have to verify how good it is myself.
So it begins..
Game Of thrones❤
Meu coração não tava preparado
Letssssssss gooooooooooo! We’ve been waiting so long 😩😩😩
Ready for dragons, blood, death and since they’re targaryens, incest
The only way I'd watch this is if y'all redid season 8 of GOT.
THE BOOK ACCURATE THRONE !!!!!
YES !!!! 😭
🎼Composer . Is it Ramin djawadi?
😌🔥❤
I am glad they are improving what game of thrones lacked on. The throne, the guards clothes etc. And this one has an ending at least. So i am allowing myself to be a little hopeful.
🥛 🥛🥛
🔥🔥
As long as D & D stay as far away from this as possible, I'll be watching. Not gonna lie it will be strange not seeing Emilia, but bring on the Targaryen's...
Uff 🔥 🔥 🔥
Awesome 💥💥🔥🔥
Been waiting for this one.
Can’t wait
Can't get more excited about it..  But plz fix 'GOT' season 8.
Bring it sooner, can't wait...
YOOOOOOOOOOO
Who is writing this?
Oh my god... The production design looks top notch...
Letssgoooo
hope they won't screw up with the project after what they did with s8
Seeing how people carry their distaste for the last season to the comment section of literally the first footage of a whole new content made of pure effort and affection is disgusting.
✨
Beware, beware the Dragonborn comes. Oops, wrong video
Real recognises real.
We don't want Dumb and Dumber, please 😣.
Please HBO max launch in India
Oh I can't wait! This is going to be so good! Matt Smiths voice! Hearing him be evil is so good!
About to be the most watched thing on YouTube
After what they did to GoT. Yeah never again. Not gonna open myself up to a potential disappointment.
DAMN son
Not interested. Why would I watch something I know already? You should continue GoT's story as Arya sails to Asshai. Her travelings would be 100x more exciting..
Looks beautiful. Now please, take your time and milk it for as long as you can!
Love from india , Kerala 😍
the Iron thrones just get an upgrade , fk hype
Dragons are mighty magic come to life! No wonder the targaryens ruled the kingdoms, who can fight fire breathing towering beasts or even want to face them in an open field?
i dont know about this.... fells disapointing a little
Hyped! And please don’t do an d&d on us 😅
😍uff theeeee
Can't wait
WOWWWWWW
Please. Do. Not. Fuck. This. Up!
When are you make max available in india ..
Season 8 killed my interested in anything related to GOT
Don’t do that.. don’t give me hope 😢
There goes my social life.
Big dub lads, now lets see how late or early in 2022 that release date is.
Dracarys - 🔥🔥🔥🐉
It's 300 years not 200 years
Waiting😍😍
The doctor is in da house of dragon
Honestly, I cannot be invested in the Targeryans knowing how disrespectfully Daenerys, their only descendant, was treated.
House Stark can't wait!!!
❤️❤️
should just use the money to reshoot S8 ...there's dragon already.
Looks epic so far, let's hope this stay to the books
Please be better than season 8 of game of thrones
Just finished watching the entire GOT series for the 25th time!  I'M READY!
Valar Morghulis
They made the throne more accurate to the books!
Sweet.
This looks way better than the original 🔥
മലയാളികൾ ഉണ്ടോ 😍
I am so excited
Dreams didn't make us kings, Dragons did 🔥🔥
Dracarys 💥. Fire will reign
bEfoRe tHe fALL oF tHe tHrOnE
Holy shits there's actually footage lmfao
Did the people from the Witcher Netflix production all got new jobs for Hotd?
Sure as hell going to wait for the whole thing to  be over before even considering watch it
Woooooooow I can't wait❤️❤️❤️❤️
MESSIRVE
Hate on Season 8 all u want. This is gonna be the next blockbuster. Would love a Balerion cameo in the series tho.
Just can't get excited for this after the decline of GoT...
I think this will be better than Game of thrones
So excited ..
I'm just waiting for more white walkers scene
The Iron throne looks exactly the way it's described in the book. Looking promising already. Please don't betray the fans this time though.
Fuck yeah!! Fire and Blood baby.
Honestly think they will not think of disappointing us like they did with season 8 so I'm hyped for this.
Is it real ??
For a minute I totally forgot about that terrible last season.  P.S. - This teaser looks amazing.
Excited to see the Targaryens at their peak, with all the might of their dragons!
Belíssimo.
Dreams didn't make us kings ... DRAGONS DID 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is it dream???😱😱 2022's biggest blockbuster 🔥
Not watching until season 8 is fixed
Looks more like The Witcher than a series about Westeros
OH MY GOOOOODDDD HUGE FKN W
Can't wait for Daemon x Aemond
The ending of GoT was such shit that it really makes me want to not watch this … which is a damn shame, smh …
Oh my god awasome
IT LOOKS AMAZING HOLY SHIT
நல்லா இருக்கு ✨💫 வாழ்த்துக்கள் 💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Let’s go!!! But no Dragon tease?!? Haha
Looks good !! But doesn't exactly feel like GOT either...i also get a Vikings vibe idk why
Can't wait
Well it looks kinda promising, even though I imagined Daemon Targaryen _very_ differently! But Matt Smith is a good actor, let's hope for the best.
YOOOOO THEY MADE THE IRON THRONE LOOK MORE LIKE THE BOOKS LFG
thought i’d feel more for this but i don’t know if i’ll ever be over the way game of thrones ended. the bad taste lingers. just cautiously curious for now…
Caught me off guard, definitely hyped now
Hate on season 8 all you want I don't care. I'm still hyped for this!
I love Game of Thrones so much but Matthew Smith's face annoys me so much :(  I don't know even why lol
Fucking hype
Holy Sh**!
Dub so big I can see it from the moon
BEYOND HYPED
YO!!!! Out of nowhere Can't wait for this
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇲🇵
REMAKE SEASON 8 FIRST. U RUINED ALL THE HOUSES
HBO MAX IS RELEASING EVERY TEASER FOR ALL THEIR SHOWS BUT NOTHING FOR NICKI
No thank you. Season 8 ruined Game Of Thrones for me, but you guys have fun.
What the heck?! It’s way too early to be dropping these trailers on us all of a sudden, y’all!😱
Hbo max woke up today and chose violence with all this new stuff.
This is gonna be fucking awful. Can't wait.
House Of The Dragon is coming to HBO Max in 2022.
Holy Shit it's here
