Our next 2 videos are ridiculous.. so subscribe 🔔
Day 5 commenting on a just Dustin video till he makes weapons with tungsten blades and iron wood handles.
"If brute force doesn't win you challenges, you are probably not using enough of it" someone ever, probably
the milk crate thing, their really stable when its only two, the higher the stack the more unstable it is. lmao impressive
I miss this Times. Back With the old Crew
Last kitty looks like it’s suffering  It looks like it cannot get up properly  Who ever likes there cat obese  Is evil Poor baby :(
zach and trent is the best duo in justdustin video
Remember kids: If Trent is in the video, there is a 99% chance he will win
the maul is the only thing that channels Trent's sledge strenght onto an axe.
3:40 Anyone else see grandpa Dustin's face?
I love how Eric is always being random things “BE THE CRATE” “BE THE WALL” “BE THE AXE” and still does nothing to the wall 😭 😂😂
Where did he go 😢😢😢
When I’m having a bad day Trent just makes it better
8:10 bro did not make it
9:40  I though they cheated for a sec
2:36 Trent laughing lol
111
trent just needs a nerf and eric needs a buff ?
7:57 I didn’t know that counts
5:41 they didnt have to edit erics kick like that 😂😂😂
You guys are using sheet rock and say it’s strong, but it in all actuality is only slightly stronger than drywall
Dustin's face 3:41 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best part of this video 9:19
Remember this SOUWEEEEEEEEEEEE
It was so cute when Eric said “I ok but the spinners”8:22
WHEN I CAME DOWN‼️....
Tren(t)😈😈😈😈
kinda unfair that the two weakest (dustin and eric) play against the two strongest (trent and zach)
Tbh, Trent is a weapon himself.
These edits kill me
Trent and Zack are the best team
Trent is like The Hulk, he's a nice guy but if you piss him off, look out.
I still say they need to make a challenge to see who can make a stronger box that can contain Trent the longest.
I like how when Eric is on Trent's team he never is really scared (except when a shovel is swinging towards his head) but Zach's over here like terrified when he's far from him
What happened to Zach?
I love you justdustin
When bro growls you know its time to celebrat
It's called a maul.. I named mine Molly lol
1000000)0)00))0000000000000000.90
how do you get the hammer in there?😊
Bro what let’s be honest da crate challenge was da most hype and dangerous challenge but died quicker than vine 😢
how did they get tools if there were boxed with no way in?
You are amazing but not deadly
cool moment 3:39
why is trent the only one who knows how to swing an axe
Trent likes anything that resembles a sledge
We still have yet to see trent vs line x
Trent can win with a pillow while Eric needs a jack hammer thats how strong Trent is
Not the wall
These videos are never dull and Trent should have played as the hulk in the avengers
3:39 😂
Bro Eric stood no chance Trent is built like the hulk
what if they break the wall that separates them?
"Zack missed.." Kinda sus there buckaroo.. lmao
HYE DUSTIN THAT'S A WALL
this was the first video the maul was introduched
This is a clever idea
THEY ARE SOOO entertaining. I recently just moved to florida and they still make me feel like im back at home.  When im in a bad mood and really dont want to laugh. these videos make me lol. I have literally watched all of his videos several million times and I just never get bored. thank u so much for spending money and time to entertain people.
Man used the clash of clans sound effect for his foot 🤣🤣
7:03 wait why does it count? It wasn’t his turn so…
3030
1010
Dustin what part of Canada do you live
Zac is to funny when he said world strongest baby
Trent deserves it
Bro I feel bad for whoever has to go against Trent
each time I see trent perform, I always think "If I'm demoing a house, He's who I should call"
1:05 Try punching throught a german wall i mean i you punch throught Yea then you are god
I feel like trent does more damage with his bare hands
Zack said he didn't need the mattress but look what happened to him 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣
Bro 3:39 😂
"Eric you're losing!".  Most inspirational words ever.
I went to a rage room for my birthday best day ever
gay
I think he has the first one complete the crate challenge
NOBODY BEATS TRENT
2:17 I had to replay that whole moment Trent broke the foam, and started ripping it, the whole time looking at Zach. To avoid being told he can't just...  op off the wall, he ripped it up. With his hands. I fricking can't Trent! Replaying a third time!
the Russian doll is called matrioška
The faca he had hahahahhhhaahhahahahahahahahahahaha
Nice 👍
Thanks!
9:50 SWEATY BOIII
I subscribe 😇😇😇
Poor Trent
Dustin is always scared for the walls but all the nets are in the wall with screws
What is that sledge I barely even seen it it’s only in this one video I think?
Dustin plays fals
if i was trent i would just kick the wood
if i was zack i would just runnnn
Trent when he finds out how there are sharp things on axes 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
If you want to read the Gospel then I will put something like that in my replies but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it and more people have at least one opportunity because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
🔥🔥
2:15 had me rolling XD bro he was screaming and trent just punches the wall LOL
If you’re trying to destroy something in a contest against Trent you WILL lose😂😂
Love ❤️
Trent ar the best
Very cool 😎
Trent made that last wall look like paper
I am 3 month behind on watching the videos I'm going to try to catch up
Good vid
Trent rules
Not to be mean but this guy seems like a Walmart Mr. Beast
Dude they used a different song what the hell
10:41 that’s what she said😏😂
Italiano  pleas
Why isn't their any opening anymore
✋😀
Dayum, the camera man is brave enough to put his hand in where trent smack the steel wall with an axe
dustin you are a cheater
Lol i already watched this so it sent me in the video where dustin did the ruuujh just instantly senting me to the next video in the playlist im watching of his videoes
I loved Trent's: "This looks like a sledge."  I love everything Trent does. He is such a character.
I was wondering why someone would buy so many of those crates at one time.
ima try this at home
I forget Zach is wolfies brother, sad to see wolfie fell of:/
cual es nombre de la cancion de fondo  ?
That was anticlimactic. Trent always wins when it comes to strength
Dustin looks like the updated steve without the beard
What music is that in the background
"a viral tik tok maybe" god damnit dustin, why'd you have to jinx it like that
Eric is adorable
Trent should definitely play Thor 😂
We need a video on how Trent is the world's strongest toddler
Let's just talk about trents laugh. Most contagious laugh ever love it. And love the content keep it up
3:40
Eric Dustin say you don’t got this Eric
Is it fair to say trent=win😂
crate challenge went viral lol
they need a guy just as big as trent and put them against each other
Eric struggling a little with the hammer, Trent just breaks it easily with his hands.
this is the new logan paul, just hope he doesn't do anything in a forest
Trents weapons are week it is just his power in his arms
Eret:use hammer smashing breaking Trent:use hand (I almost write hammer as human 😅😅😅)
Hi
Eric: be the crate be the crate  what i heard: eat the crepe eat the the crepe (ps i was hungry that time)
JustDustin
Yall just making Trent stronger with these breaking videos.
It looks like Trent's foot is better/stronger then tools
Tent had it from the start
Im closterfobic so I could never do something like this
Part 2?
What was that face
trent stronk
I saw a video where a dude died after falling off cause he did it on concrete and fell
Love from india
Lets just face it, Trent is always switched on to "SMASH EVERYTHING". As soon as he got the splitting maul, i instantly knew that he would go ape.
That looks so claustrophobic
Sorry dustin, but erik is my favorite
So this is where the crate challenge originated from lmaoooo
Trent is my spirit animal
Trent: I don’t need a weapon  Weapon: everyone needs me Trent:I don’t because I am the weapon.
Fortnite kids  be like box like a fish literally free
Why you playing a quiet game 6:18
Who ever said Trent needed tools to get out of that box 😂 he is like Steve from Minecraft he can break a tree with small effort probably
Trent was just letting them have a head start
This low key reminded me of siege
Trent is awesome 😎
The aromatic banana summatively pretend because noodle weekly match upon a smelly turnover. ritzy, coordinated almanac
The cuts to the hall going In on the basketball challenge tho 😂
I just love seeing Trent at work 🙏😂
0:10
"zach missed..." why am i sure he didnt...
Yo man keep up the good work
Warning do not try any of the stunts preformed in this video they are preformed by somewhat professionals
Trent  HULK SMASH!!! lol :)
I Seen some one die from the crate challenge on Facebook she did it in a gas station right in front of the pump it was taller the the pump she fell and hit her head and was bleeding out and the other girl recording just standing there saying oh she  fell  yall
Just so u know the crate challenge is a satanic ritual. So there's that.
that isent normal how easy that was for Trent
I love how Trent was just like "Oh an axe" like not surprising
dustin always cheats but he still always looses
Why’d it cut when he went for the last hoop
🔥 content
Trent bro omg 🤣🤣🤣 screw the mallet punch down the wall
crate

Hi

Hi

100 LAYERS OF MILK CRATES!!
Why doesn’t Trent box someone? I feel like he would be great at boxing he just needs technique
don’t get me wrong I love your vids I thought the crates were glued until zach proved they weren’t
this was posted on my birthday 😝😝
👁️BE THE CRATE👁️
7:20 zachs face lmfao
Dustin was definitely defensive when he played football homeboy got no hands
Berd did the best at the milk crate challenge
1.let your opponent some time to start 2.smash the wall with only one hit with your fist 3.leaves without elaborating
The trick be hind that is just keep walking
I saw trent
If that box was the 17th then how small was the first one
Trent is a breast
I wonder what happened to trav
Ridiculous
My dog got sick and won’t eat anything and barley drinks any water let alone the Pedialyte that I’ve been giving him. he’s only 4 turning 5 months in September and I want to get him see as soon as possible this all started Saturday morning anything you can share will really help and be appreciated.

If you have ever played rainbow six siege Trent is sledge 😂😂🤣
Trent is such a BEAST!😂😂💪🏼💪🏼❤️
Trent looks uncomfortable inside the first box ✋😂

i have a video suggestion      what if you assign 2 people to focus on making the best armored box or anything like armored car and have 2 people focus on making a weapon to destroy what theother team builded
Who needs a hammer when you got Trent??😂
I literally can’t believe he answered my request he actually put in the poll drop omg 😱
BE THE CRATE BE THE CRATE

Mr Trent is overpowered. 😅😅
1:03 that scream tho

I sense a certain lack amount of fairness
Saw Dustin say he could do the rod catch challenge on his reacts channel…😬😂
dustin your face
Ah finally Dustin isn’t in a boxes for a video and Trent gets to feel the pain
Am I the only one who does not like zach
Make a box with a molten lava/glass wall

Надеюсь а4 не сворует это видео
Why is Zack never the trappee?! He's cheated so much he deserves to be one!
I wonder where trents from
Pls do. Another infinity box
Finally my 2 favorite justdustin people are on a team together- Zach and Trent
Looks like you finally got the"Sledgeaxe"
Just changing the light from 20 K to 21k lol
This is ridiculous such an amazing video. :)
Trent Identifies as one thing in these challenges and that is a threat
Its quite clear both the segments were shot differently
Spoiler: the guy in the box wins
Trents new favorite weapon the axe plus the sledgehammer
Lol 2 videos where the edit the makes
I feel like trent could be one awsome firefighter
Lol why sledge hammer
you make the best videos keep up the amzing content dustin  and i bought your merch!
WAT IT SAID IT JUST CAME out but it came out 9 hours ago

That maul is freaking broken lol
Poor trent hahah

Only real ones know where the rod challenge came form
I gota give it to trent he really looked like he was putting extra effort in it
Imagine the garbage truck crew needing to clean the mess that dustin put out for them every week
I have seen people pretty much break their backs doing the crate challenge. Surprised they are risking it.
Going to need that Trent workout ASAP
Ininity box scp 100000000

Dustin says he can do the falling sticks in the fastest hands in the world video but he cannot
So cool man keep it up

If you are going to do walls made of food you should put a box under and eat it later
Infinity box does that mean its impossible?
When Trent was hitting the metal he made it look like he was hitting tin foil

Hello dustin Im baaaaaaaaack
Why is this wood so hard that kinda sus
You got the rod challenge from a reaction vid
I want to meet you in person y'all are so awesome
Until trent bracks it
love the honedepot box basketball goals💪✅
It’s really just annoying when Trent wins almost every challenge. Have Trent do the challenges to make the videos more fun.
Dustin could literally start a carnival full of these mini games 😅😄
We all live see Trent just smashing things
Blue for the win
This video is exciting
I love your video
Do a video that has Trent as the weapon
Hi evil
0:04 trents real voice!
i am you
His painting skills are geting better
Trent is an beast really enjoying watching the videos looking forward to seeing the next one
I wouldn't be within a 10 mile radius of Trent with a sledge
Trapped in a box for 2 hours haha I play games for 5 hours.
"What's the worst that can happen" you can snap your arm or break your neck
TRENT THE NEW HULK
That catch stuf was that inspired bij that video you react to?
This is first time that trent is not destroying a weapon !
Bro this is basically the best job: you’re break thing (all I wanted to do as a kid) and you get paid 😂 I would to that for free
This video is cool!
does anyone else miss the pain train 😕
hey dustin are you in canada because i am and there are not much youtubers in canada so shoutout to all the canadians, reply and say i am canadian to support the canadians!!!!
if you do another survival weapons vid trent should make a steel glove
.
Hi
Can I just state the fact that Dustin wore a blue shirt and a blue hat instead of a black shirt and black hat
Nice video
Who else misses Travis
you used the idea from your second channel with the falling sticks.
57 mins late
Finally Zach is on Trents team
100 layers of candles
They definitely made the boxes more secure 😂
They got the second challenge from reacts channle
Awesome video I really liked it I sub an like  Keep up the good work
Hey Dustin you should make a video with 100 layers of lether vs 100 layers of plywood
Time to invest in milk crates
When they start throwing the stuff out I get scared 😳
I think red team cheated
how to actually contain trent:  Every 100 layer wall in one.   even the line x one to top it all off
Oh yeah one lady died when she hit the ground on the milk crate challenge thing.
I like how they put the challenge they saw on JustDustin reacts channel in this😂👌🏽
I'm just gonna tell it like it is, Trent is my boo💞💞💕💕
Trent Is over powered
Nice
Make a Pykrete wall. It's very simple to make, at it is just a 20% - 80% mixture of sawdust and water, frozen into a block. It's several times stronger than an equivalent ice block, and it would be really interesting to see how fast you guys can cut through it.
not gonna lie tren in god mode
the audio was so low
Paintball
Why does Trent look like Martin Luis the strongman
Can you do 100 layers of glass
finally, a challenge where Dustin isnt in a box. lol good video.
your guys pain for entertainment pray to god you guys exsist
legendary!
Why are they doing the milk challenge that’s very dangerous and I’ve seen friends brake bones
What do we all ways lern never piss trent off
The cloud in the back of the second challenge looks like the akatski I forgot how to spell it
Dustin is easily a top 10 YouTuber he’s funny asl too
Who else saw theses challenges from the reaction channel
WEEEE
Crate Challenge   JustDustin React: WE SHOULD DO THIS SOME TIME JustDustin: Does crate challenge in the next video Me: WOW‼️  *Ps* they never reacted to a crate challenge that was "Reaction Time"
Dustin you are my favorite youtuber I've been watching you since Zack had dreads I love you man keep grinding and doing good work
Trent: “Anything that looks like a sledge *must use*
That looks very uncomfortable and cramped I would definitely not be able to fit in there I'm a big old shark!
Is that catching challenge inspired from the fast reflexes vid on your second channel?
haha
Dustin how much can Trent lift
Trent should be a firer man
I'm sorry to say this but you look like unspeakable
A destruction challenge usually means Trent wins. No contest.
I'm so proud of you Eric- 2021
trent should be a fireman
528th?
Hi
Justin is the worlds biggest baby
I waste my battery and electricity on this channel, and im happy that i do
Hi
I’ve been watching you for forever 😂
why do you play the same song every video?
The rod catch one is from the JustDustin reacts video it called something fastest hands the part in this vid is at 2:45
Dustin punched the wall and noone yelled
lol get revange to justdustin!!!
Y'all need lav mics outside the boxes, the ones inside are way too loud.
Glad to see some original content from a younger YouTuber. And a fellow Canadian at that. Also justDustin Reacts is great stuff too watched all the content in last couple months! Much respect from London ON
But who was dropping the sticks tho??
Trent all the way 😎😀😃
bruh no home depot sponsors yet?
Amazing content!!
I am the 501 comment
Oh lord the milk crate challenge? Hope no one gets hurt
Good stuff, loved how Trent was so disappointed by the fact that he got a mallet.
I don't think its good at all to be part of the community supporting this challenge, so many people already have broken body parts for what I guess is fame
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
“Can I get a crepe?”   “I said crate”   “How many you got?” 😂
We all know why we’re here,
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Geeze the hamaxe is op
Get on box go over the 3 wall
I think that I suggested this on the dangie bros on the tiny vs big box video
The name for the Russen doll is Matroska
Finally seeing  Justin and Zach as opponents!!!
I really like your content keep making people happy! (You are one of my favorite YouTubers!)
Great vid. Extraordinary !!
This was probably one of the most one sided challenges they've ever done
You got the second challenge from the reaction video that you made
The challenge has made it to YouTube omg
challenge idea buying 2 cars trap trent and eric in the cars and suround the cars with stell
This big boy dont need a veapons his breaking whith heands😂😂😂😂👌👌👌👍👍👍💪💪💪💪💪
1:50 the most wholesome thing ever
Love watching ur videos with these challenges more please 😁
He did the challenge of the poles from just Dustin reacts
Does Trent get to keep that weapon bec he won?
2nd challenge was from Dustin reacts
Early
when you realize those are minecraft blocks
Dude you should put a warning for the first challenge that was dangerous 😰
3:41 hahahahaha that face
Hi
one of the best youtubers out there, i love this group
Pause it at 3:41
Love the video man
You are the best ever youtuber on the planet
so funny Trent just smash
I feel like if Trent just like, stood up and/or stretched (like you do in the morning) he’d break out of the first box pretty quickly.
Lets face it Trent is a walking WMD
He said he could do this in the reaction video
Hello I love your videos
loving these videos man, keep it up.
Aye I'm somewhat early
NOT THE MILK CRATES
Awesome vid
Omg love the vid keep making bangers
TRENT SMASH!!!
Beans
100 layers of oobleck
Trent did more with his hands than wepons
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO      GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!
I'm conflicted because I like Erik and Trent
I knew Trent won before I clicked on the video cause it was only just over 10 minutes
CEO of walls and glue and now he's turned into CEO of hard challenges
Trent chode break the first littel box by himself
HYYYYPE!!!
Aye I made it within 45 minutes
Yes
Trent went straight up beast mode!!! Respect!💯✌🤣
I LOVE YOU'R VIDEOS!!! <3 <3
Dustin da best we all love his content
So fun
Who is yalls cleaning crew
Uploed more plss
audio is a bit ppfffttt but good video
Some guys arm literally zig zagged after falling off milk crates
No one : Me : *Writes a joke i worked 4 hours on*     *Random verified Channel* : "I am about to end this man's whole career"
Pebis
In next video do a stuck in a box under water and my friend can only help me with doing challenges and get better and better upgrades weapon
claustrophobia go BRRRRRR
Trent gets a maillot but uses his bare hands instead 😂
What was the editing for the basketball challenge
Dustin like if your fav word is sauh hau!!!😩😲
Eric pickaxe Trent storm breaker
I didn’t realize how rich he was, that wood probably cost so much
I would be scared
🔥🔥🔥
Love ur vids man

I’ll be honest I don’t like how justin looks in a full blue outfit
first
3:41
you are the best
Dustin delivers as always and didn’t you reacts to the poles challenge. KEEP IT UP
Hi
the challenge at 2:45 was from the reaction video lol
396th comment
Dustin I love you bro your literally the only reason I have YouTube
I saw the Instagram video of the box challenge 🤣
im early the video came out 28 minents ago
One challenge was from reaction channel
Been waiting for something like this
Aye your mic sounded blown out
hello i am me
Sure have a price limit on materials to imprison Zach but go over budget and just say its karma for all the cheating he has done in those types of videos.
Nice video!
Trent has his own stormbraker
Little did you know Dustin didn't want to get his hands dirty cuz he's training for the cook-off w jado (sanji status)
Does this challenge really need an explanation? 😂
I love that the 2nd challenge was made off the idea from their other channels most recent vid
The amount of creativity and dedication u put into ur videos is soo insane dude! Keep up the  good work im always with ya 👍❤
And plus why eric and Trent not the same team I like the team
Ok??
Can you do more 100 layer vids
very cool vid :)
I like original challenges and you make original challenges so I like these
Trent is the man
Ok

Wait why are Dustin not with Zach
I love all your videos and they’re so cool like y’all are in sane
Imagine someone who’s claustrophobic in this
Holy moly that was amazing
Your the best
2:39 they got that idea from a react video
Back with another great banger 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dustin took the whole rod challenge from his react channel
if i had a dollar for everytime justdustin posts a banger of a video, i would be very rich
I love ur vids
Trent could probably break out with his hands
He

@Justdustin 0:30-0:40 you can fall and break your arm in multiple places ive seen a video of a guy about your size, maybe a little smaller, fall on the crates and broke his arm in two places, bone protruding from arm... Really need to be careful.
