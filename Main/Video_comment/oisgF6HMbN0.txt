what a weird landlord. how rude.
Are you from the uk? Like born and or raised
If you really care about what's on those drives, back them up online!
you dont have to let go of clothes. if you love them, keep them. read marie kondo.
love the robotic sarcastic comments!
"the walls itchy" -taz 2021
I haven’t looked at your channel for a while and can I just say you look so much happier??? Like I don’t know you personally but like between when I last looked and now you just seem lighter! If that’s the case that’s awesome and I’m super happy for you!
Taz , may I know how old are u? Seems like you achieved a lot in such young age. Proud of you, girl🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMG! We got the same way of cleaning! 😅😅
Hey taz where’s moon we’ve missed her... is she coming back? 🥺❤️❤️
hi i am new on your channel....and really confused....do you study in London or you finishde studying and now you work?
girl I think you might benefit from an ADHD assessment
3:11 same. we never know when it'll become handy and who knows also save our life while at it XD
You travelled the depths of your soul for the quarenteen season of your life. 😁
I felt you when you said “just can’t let go of clothes”. I keep them thinking someday I would have an event where I’d need to wear it. If I ever get a xyz job I’d need this outfit and I never let go of clothes.
Uhhhh... taz, I might've been on one of them planes not even lying, I mean, if you recorded this on the 12th of march
I also have problems using most manufactured facial skincare products.  I've tried so many natural products, and even some of those weren't right... and very expensive too.  In the last couple of years I've been using a few drops of Argan oil as a moisturiser.  I use 'Arganic Culinary Argan Oil' which I buy from Ocado, it's a food grade oil, works so well on skin, leaves it soft but doesn't clog pores at all.  Beware of fake Argan Oil... I bought one last year... the seller on Ebay had a perfect sales rating but their so called organic Argan oil was mixed with another oil, it had a weird petroleum fragrance to it and left my skin really itchy and red... an expensive mistake... I'm now using that on my hair... it's fine on hair!  That's why I stick to buying the oil from a supermarket, it's more reliable.  You can also use three drops of Argan oil on a folded piece of damp kitchen towel... it makes a brilliant make remover, especially for the eye area... won't sting eyes or make vision blurry. I also only cleanse my skin once in 24 hours (night time cleanse). Over cleansing was causing my skin to turn dry and breakouts occurred.  I also love using 'Earth Friendly Baby Wipes' as a cleanser they are very cool and gentle, oil and citric acid free.  They do a wonderful job of removing all traces of make up.  The cloths are a soft biodegradable natural fibre, so don't cause friction burns on the skin, but they have enough texture to grab all the make up (no pointless sliding around on the face!)  I buy the baby wipes from my local health food store, or a bulk buy from Ebay and Amazon.  I never get breakouts, rashes or dry skin now... perfect skin with no high costs!☺️
she moved a month ago 0o0
My friend when is opens my closet: hey ! Is this a black hole??? Me : no , these are my black baggy pants and black over sized t- shirts. You really don't know me??? You know your friend is a baddie.  My mind: ummm...well...I can't scold her for that,because even my best friend don't know I am a baddie.
Nana lunch
Beans collection nice
I think maybe you should have renewed the tenancy and then redoecorated because you have done all the work for the landlord and they probably saw that its now cleaned and decorated with new fridgefreezer,surfaces and hob and has saved them a goodly amount of money which they will now cash in on.  Good thing you bounce back with positivity!
Panoramic?
SELL YOUR CLOTHES ON DEPOP
If u are gonna throw away the skincare pls give it to me cause I can't afford it, I am a jobless college student
Honestly thought she meant she had to be on the phone for a month. pls-
There is no such thing as to many beans. You WILL eat them 💓
Taz: Do y'all think 2020 went really quick or really slow Me: Yes
Tax: walks through the window me: oh my gawd
i'm so happy for you!
Finally got the flat together and BAM we moving
✋👋👇☝✊👎👉👊👇☝👏🐰🐔🐇🐔🐥🐏🐤🐏🐔🐇🐇🐹
If the owner has not renewed your rental agreement as they intend to sell it, how come a new tenent is coming to see it?
Imagine the new tenant of her old flat finding her videos and seeing what happened in their new flat before they moved in. Must be so weird when you consider a space to be yours but see what it meant to someone else
✨ beans stash ✨
No matter how bad the first is, it will always cause you nostalgia.  I guess it's almost like an unwritten rule
I was worried that Taz was jumping out the window at 13:37
Taz is such a water sign!!! I also can't seem to get rid of unnecessary items and haaaaate letting go of a place:(
I found taz showing her random stuff the most entertaining video of my week
Shata shata shata shata shata shata shataaaaaaaaaa 😠🤬☹️😡😠
I saw that tata mask!! Omfg how did I not know you were an army!!!
Tax has changed and friends as a person so much and I love her so much for it.
I have the same tiger tshirt <3 8:25
I agree! 2020 flew by like crazy!
when taz tries explaining her feelings and emotions and I’m  just there understanding and  nodding my hand like it’s ok taz lol
Taz did not live in a flat without double glazing omg
I adore you. we're the same person, but your braver. and funnier.
I don’t think I have related to someone so much in my life, just wanting to buy clothes and never wear them...
Love that you donated the food!! :) xx
BRO I just left for one year of this channel is growing sooooo much I Been watching her since  hit 1k
I can totally relate to that point bro where you said for a place to be clean you had to empty and deep clutter it ✨. I do the same but it takes Humugous amount of my time that I schedule for the day 😂
And all the charity shops are shut - I've got bags of stuff too  and nowhere to take them to.
Welcome to London, Taz, where you have no idea when you need a new flat...  On average I move to a new flat every 1.5 years, job location, my landlord wanted the flat back for renovation (basically wanted me out for 2 months with all my stuff and moved back) and so on...
Taz, thanks for this video, it's perfect timing as I'm moving out of my flat and this somehow helps me process it 💕
You said panoramic at the end 😂😂
No one:  Me: Taz is tommyinnit in the first outfit
If you want to make sure your hard drives survive a fire (hope that never happens) but put them in a metal box
Taz you should try minimilism. Just a video suggestion
Does anybody know what the name of the song is at 1:25? I have tried Googleng the lyrics but nothing comes up. Please, I need to know, it's so beautiful!!  Edit : Even Shazam couldn't find it 😭
Your old place was crap glad you found a nice one x
random but does anyone know where Taz got her mask from?? (Or anything similar)   I've been wanting to know for ages now
I really hope she doesnt end like haley pham who started changing for the worse after getting more famous and getting financial independent. I hope money wont change her great personality
Ahh Taz, probably did the thing I did and used all new products at once, which your skin will not respond well tooo lol. Gotta go like one product at a time if any at all
tazinnit
Taz showing off her beans collection like its her baby!!
the...♡bean cupboard♡
I HOPE THAT WASNT THE FRAGILE BOX
Taz, you have to backup those hard drives ! HDD reliability is basically a lottery, especially for units older than 3 years. For content creators like you, the best solution for backup will be device called NAS (from company like Synology) which has better cost to data volume ratio than cloud solutions like Drop Box or Google Drive (in long term).  This is not cheap, but data recovery from failed drive cost at least few times more than one time investment in good backup solution.  Remember that memories stored on those portable drives are priceless for you.
2020 went by very quick. I agree.
You're so relatable 😆
I kept seeing taetae merch..... I think her bias  is V 😂😅
Are you Asian? You look like one.
Incredible Work ✌️
Do y'all remember the polish family
omg.. I stop watching u for a while after you move into the new apartment and now I'm back and u are moving lol what a coincidence
Having just moved house I can 100% relate to the having too much stuff.
the normal person in me : oo a red and white top the mcyt person in me : SHE HAS THE TOMMYINNIT TOP
moving is organized chaos.
Hey taz what do you do for a living cause u made 16$ out of this video or more, and I don't think that's enough to lay rent, bills, food etc-
Tbh, I watch Taz's video because she proves that "It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's not but it's fine in the end" motivates me to do so much, like start a baked beans collection and cook more even though I don't really seem to enjoy it that much.
New tenant? Thought the landlord was going to sell it? And giving you only a few weeks to move out doesn't seem legal.
i used to just use water on my face and my skin was rlly clear but it comes back to bite u because i now get pimples out of no where 😂
the walls itchy-
I’m so sad Taz is leaving her first place
she said panoramic not pandemic lmaoo
The bay window is beautiful! Also my mum had a friend who's skin was really bad and she tried so much skin care but a doctor told her she didn't have bad skin she just had sensitive skin and t he skin care wasn't helping So the doctor had her only rinse her face for about a month and it cured her skin 😁
13:35 omg my heart
2020 went so fast I’ve got two months of college left n Dno what I’m doing with my life anymore
Whoa! You are wearing a T.SHIRT...THAT FITS😉I'm confused am I on the right channel? Loving the monkey😁💖oh!spare boxes..I have some..how many do you want?..50?..100...OK! I can probably spare you about 200 at a squeeze.😂YOU DON'T have a lot of STUFF...I.. HAVE a lot of stuff.😂💖
Taz did not have to move , unless she wanted to. In normal times after the initial AST lease expires the rental becomes a rolling monthly rental with 2 months notice from the landlord and 1 months notice from the tenant. The landlord MUST give the tenant a section 21 notice to quit.  However in these pandemic times, the S21 notice is not enforceable for 6 months.  Many S21 notices fail because the landlord/agent did not comply with the many regulations on either moving in or giving notice.  Having said that, the new flat is much nicer.
Taz you are wrong here. You only wear I've hit a new low hoodie
I had 9 ads in the first 9 minutes of this video.
https://youtu.be/bNxqSEUWm3A
Taz r u from sylhet?
I was also planning to rent my place for another year and found out by chance that the landlady is selling the place... So I'm also moving in a rush, I found a bigger place but is a bit run down... I'm packing everything, the movers come on Saturday, but everything is so hard to do, I'm always tired :( do not move while being 8 months pregnant
i keep in my bill expanding file a notebook that contains my account numbers, what company i'm with, a contact number for that company, any reference numbers i'm given etc. all simplified. that way i don't have to scramble around as much if i move or have any issues - i learned this from my mum.
Welll this came out of nowhere....
Taz I'm trying to find the right way to say this because I don't want to alarm you but I scarily related to this way too much... The thing you said about understanding but not processing/comprehending it. I think it might be something called dissociation and I get it a lot. my therapist has been explaining it to me. But I also found out I have ADHD and that is what it feels like Like feeling and thinking way too much  but not being able to process that its really happening
You need a podcast!! I could listen to you talk for hours <3
is that legal to only give 2 weeks notice???
please get cloud storage if thats the only backup you have omg
so are we going to just ignore the fact that she said panoramic instead of pandemic
Next new tenant? So the person who wants to buy this flat or a new renter and all this was for not?
We love when we moving and we try to get the whole deposit back 😂
Landlord didn’t give much notice, it seems. I had a place sold out from under me and uncomfortable as it was, I had 3 months notice. It doesn’t sound right. Anyway, it’s always disturbing to have to move. You’re putting on a very, very brave show of it.
TAZ I HOPE YOU SEE THIS AS ITS REALLY IMPORTANT!   YOUR HARD DRIVES!!   Hard drives degrade over time and so you need to move your backups online onto like Google photos or a similar service as one day those hard drives will just die and you'll lose the stuff on there!
I love YOUR ACCENT
Your lovely too taz good luck in your new appartament
Haha imo you made moving look SOOOO EASY!!!! I just moved too. 2 weeks ago. And, so that coincidence doesn't stop here, last year on the 9th of March, I moved countries... one week later BOOM! lockdown. But moving is a bi%*#&%#. I keep moving since 2004 and it never got easier. Never will. I hate it. But... yeah.... we have moving in common lol and in the same month of the year... ONE YEAR lol I did not expect that :)  btw, new subscriber here. You rock, girl!
Let's get taz to 2M!!
Was I the only person who heard panoramic?
Lots of love, may the new house you are moving into brings happiness and joy in your life. Stay blessed.
Water ur skin, love .. Thats all u need
she has the tata cushion.... are you an army?
Did she get her deposit back tho? I need to know 😅
So I'm watching this getting excited for the new flat video 😁 then I realise that it's only 3 mins away!
nobody: me: oh hey I have the same shirt :D
Can someone please tell me is she Indian? I mean i feel like she is but.....is she?
Happy move-in! Good luck!
sees Qatar Airways, people living in Qatar:👁👄👁
Have been waitinggggg
S21 means you get 6 months to move when a s21 notice is given. Because of the pandemic they’ve made the notice longer.
I feel like she's trying really hard to be positive. Her eyes look so sad! Better days await you Taz. Hang in there <3
I live in Australia I don’t meet anyone like you
I would love to be with you!!! I’m Mark from Sydney Australia
Same here where moving to an another country :((((((
Wating for the apartment tour video!
In a panaramic 😂love Taz
Omg wow it’s gone so fast! It was lovely too see you blossom into who you are now! 🖤🖤🖤 What about all your furniture? Or did that come with the flat lol
Landlord has to give at least 6 months notice now to move, why not tak your time to move Taz and which would give you time to find a place to move into
Ya landlord won’t complain about a likkal paint job hahaa
It doesn’t sink in sometimes haha
Ugh that bill anxiety. I feel you girl
I knew living in rent is a big problem also living in your own house is a problem.. I used to say I would love to live in my own house but the freaking problems 😭😭😭 and unpacking 😭😭 I recently move to my new house and I am so lazy 😭😭😭
You say you're not organised but your harddrives are labelled and you've been backing everything up. That's way better than most people.
Lv taz
Typical London landlords.... Handled it like a pro, Taz!
I moved once and packed everything myself. The next time I moved i payed the extra and the moving guys packed everything up for me! Stress free
ngl i'm hella confused as to why you donated your food. Its great you donated it but...you can just eat it. Better yet you'll just buy it again since you need it...
I'm a simple person. If i'm moving that week no one is viewing the place. They can wait a few more days. If they HAVE to come they can accept it in whatever state it is. I'm not gonna move things for something that takes 15 minutes.
when you realize taz fixed this place for the new tenant
We're same hahahahha I tried skin care this quarantine and it give me pimples so I stop and cried on what I did to my skin hahahhahaha
Olio is a great app for passing on stuff that you no longer need when moving or just decluttering and can be of great use to others and avoids landfill!
Taz in the future with Multi-Million Euro Mansion: Welcome to the Beans Room and its just filled with with beans
2020 was Both.. It went by fast but it also felt slow
I just imagine you are visiting an apartment and meeting Taz
My skin also started breaking out from trying to much new skin care
2:56  this is soooo much relatable
BYE IM SO EXCITED FOR THE TOUR
I'm crying 😭
She's crying from inside...
I'm not going to lie.. I thought this was a late vlog from when you moved into this flat! 😂
Skincare routine should start with the basic first, i'll breakout if i used entirely different routines in one day, i should tried new product with like once a week and build it up for a month to knew if my skin accept it or not
Taz is a different breed😳
I know this sounds counterintuitive but my skincare routine is super basic. Just cleanser and moisturiser but I've been using elf's supertoner or whatever in the yelloe bottle and it's really helping my hyperpigmenstion. I was always someone who had naturally clear skin too :(
04:36 that hoodie really represents your struggle rn 😂😂😂
Wait.. did she say panoramic?? 😳😅
Omg i keep every box from new anything I buy *incase I need them again* WHYYYYY do I do this 🤦‍♀️
You made the landlord do so much work on the flat he realized he could sell it. Kinda pisses me off you got the boot!
Hey in terms of acne , aloe vera gel is helping me aLOT
not me remembering when she moved in and decorated her flat
17:35 “moving by yourself, especially in a *panoramic*” love that 😂
I just use water on my face and skincare makes me break out tooo!
It good to know that I'm not the only one with the problem of hoarding dozens of articles of clothing that I know I'm not going to wear or only rarely wear 🤣
Jesus is our lord and savior
Taz literally love moving vlogs. I hope your new flat is a beaut. Defo keep your desk! I love your desk so much!!
I can't wait to watch the "flat makeover" videos for this new flat
your videos helped me get through quarantine and even I'M gonna miss your flat :(((((
Csnt wait for a room toour
Taz THANK YOU FOR BEING YOU! You are so real, so relatable and so inspiring that watching your videos gives me hope for myself! I've been feeling very down, hopeless and have felt like just ending my suffering (physically and mentally... I'm dealing with some major health problems and severe depression) to make all the pain go away but then I watch 1 of your videos with your beautiful, smiling face and I see how you have difficult times also but you always push through and it gives me hope that I'll be able to continue doing the same. Honestly Taz, you have saved my life on more than 1 account! I live all the way across the pond in a state called Pennsylvania, USA you have no idea who I am, I'll unfortunately never meet you to thank you in person for saving my life, you get so many msgs and comments that you'll probably never see this but YOU TAZ, YOU have been helping me to keep living! THANK YOU! I hope this does not sound crazy but I LOVE YOU & I LOVE YOU FOR BEING YOU! Sending lots of love 🖤 and GREAT BIG HUGS 🤗 to you wishing you continued success and happiness in your new flat and life in general! You're seriously my life saver just about daily 😘❤🤗
Girl, you should have told the people who wanted to show you apartment NO!  They screwed you over only giving you a month notice and then they want to show your apartment?
What agency did you get in touch with to find a new place???
Same, I had skincare products for a long time and I always broke out, then I used soap in Corentin... clean skin.  It's so nice to watch your vlogs, very calming. 🙂 Beans collection..😁
Hold on.. you had to move out because they are selling, but yet they have new tenants anyway..   Why couldn’t you just stay?!
Are you staying in London or moving back to Wales?
The last year has both zoomed by and been going backwards at the same times it’s weird
I'm so excited for your new '' fresh time ''
What a great video🤗I really hope you enjoy living in your new flat🙏sending love and wishing you good luck in your new flat🎊🎉🌸🕊xx
My good.. why are there so many ads? :(
tommyinnit
Taz all u need is sunscreen !!
Whaa... It literally feels like as if she moved in just a few weeks ago and now she is moving out already?!
17:35 panoramic or you mean pandemic lmao
The landlord used you. You improved the flat, he wants to sell it now. Very sus
This short time frame seems sketchy, borderline illegal
2020 was over so quick, I don't feel like I have developed at all. Forever fourteen. I have even forgotten everything from school. Maybe I have a problem.
17:34 did she say panoramic or am I tripping u_u
i've been watching you for years and i feel so privileged to have seen you grow over the years, i'm so proud of you taz!
She was just finished with the decorations
Lookes  likes  too me like an 🇮🇳Indian🇮🇳. #ProudlyIndian
the way you talk about processing things and events at 4:53 is EXACTLY how I feel. I know what is happening but I somehow can't realize and process it on some level. Been going through some huge changes, long planned events and such and it all feels so unreal ??? I thought I was alone with that, thankfully I'm not. Hopefully you'll soon feel at home in your new flat!
you just explained the way i clean in the most perfect way possible 7:49
I moved to a new flat last year as well and had to buy all the furniture new which was not so easy, because all the stores were closed for weeks 🙈. Thankfully at least the kitchen was build-up one day before everything closed 😅
I remember you from Bombay begums
nah sometimes you realise your skin had a good natural chemistry like playing around with skincare just for fun was a bad idea 😭😭😭
With the skincare taz, it’s important to have one even your skin doesn’t show immediate results it’s still beneficial and good. Breaking could also be from your bad diet but I’m not a skincare expert just suggesting 🤍
🥺 taz I’ve been watching you since 2018
1:51 BTS 💜
heck i'll miss that flat and i never was there
TOMMYINIT SHIRT 0:22
When yr only hear to see taz in stress
I remember 2020 had 3 months in total which I lived Jan, Feb & March....Lol the rest went blank blank and a blank thn I realized it's 2021 and okay hey I'm still alive. Breathing check 😂😂😂
Did I hear right??... Taz: “moving in a panoramic”
Now its my time to move out from parents house. Scary but exciting
Tip:::: do a swatch before you use a product
oh no why did you leave the tree there
Am I the only one who just figured out tax has a nose piercing?  Just me? Ok
Beans beans their good for your heart the more you eat the more you fart 🤪
PANORAMIC 🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's so taz
omg the shirt!!!!! Tommyinnt
Poor taz, what happen? Praying
If the Landlord is going to sell, how come you have other tenants viewing it?
I love the progress that you've made this past year! I've always loved your content, but it truly shows how much you have grown into a wonderful human being x thank you for taking us on this journey. Can't wait to see where life takes you next!
“In a panoramic” 😂
If ur landlord wants to sell the flat. Why is there new tenants? Oh they wanna buy it.?
I don't know how I got through this panoramic either
I think the fact that the day after she moved in to her new flat, her TV was finally fixed, is a very good sign. Also I think her new flat looks very nice!
Imagine moving in a panoramic
Sell your clothes on Depop and Vinted
Taz:decorates her apartment  Also taz:moves out
AGAIN???
Look, almost 40, 2 kids, a husband, 9 pets, still winging it. You're doing fine.
About the clothes, its sooooo me!💯
🤗
Awww Taz I just love how you explain things! Your just the best!
Not me watching this instead of packing my own flat to move 👀
Hey
Taz could and could not be the most relatable human on earth
Are gonna get married soon???
Breakouts after starting a skin care is most likely your skin purging.
Now watching :D on my lunch break the more you know lmao
"in a panoramic" XD HAHAHAHAHAHA omg Taz I love you!!!
well done! i feel ya! I just moved alone from my flat in Prague to Portugal. and was telling myself all the time -what a stupid timing to do that :) hope your new flat will make you as happy as the old one :)
I CANT WAIT FOR THE TOUR 😩😩😩
Already moving that was quick
this flat was Taz's fermentation station 😉
since u hv clear skin, maybe u can just stick with cleanser, sunscreen and moisturizer , just 3 is enough bcs mybe ur skin is sensitive to active ingredients, just a suggestion, love ya btw
I feel bad for Taz moving out just because of that shitty landlord. Just the fact that the flat were left with a lot of unmaintained equipments already proves that landlord is a shit. It's a struggle but good for you Taz. You deserve better. Sending you hugs
Taz: why do i keep collecting empty boxes and stuff  Ans: that's so normal when you're from Britain Jk no offenses
17:35 panoramic???? 😂
You did it, succeeded, and your new place has so many beautiful windows!
Oi, do more food videos. These vids r good as well but i feel like i like watching u cook and eat more!!!!!!!!
Couple lil tips if the landlord is gonna be an arse: They aren't allowed to keep any deposit to render the flat in a better condition than how you found it. Contest it or contact Shelter (charity that helped us when we dealt with a dodgy landlord)  I'm fairly sure that it's like a month's notice in writing MINIMUM that they need to give you, two weeks seems sus for a no-fault eviction which is what this sounds like it was.  Take pictures of everything when moving out - like walls and floors, just in case they make some crap up. It's such a stressful time and you're dealing with it wayyyy better than I did
Oof this happened to us, but our landlord was INFINITELY better with it.  We knew they were selling as they were showing people the property but they were selling to someone else who would continue to rent it out, so we stay put, right?  Well the person they ended up selling to blindsided them and revealed that, actually, they're turning the flats (we lived in a block of four) into monitored housing, meaning we all had to move out.  We were absolutely gutted cause we'd just got it how we liked it, but the landlord did us all a solid and was like 'we're giving you two months, so double what we are supposed to, AND since they bought the place as seen we can leave it however' (like not a tip but just don't worry about painting and mould) and can get our full deposit back EARLY!  We miss that place so much, I hate the house we had to quickly move to, but it could've been much worse.
love the bean cupboard! my friend had a bean advent calendar last year... literally just tins of beans each day..
Excellent adulting! Sending well wishes xo
you don't hear it from me but taz's new flat looks way cozier than her old one! wishing u luck and happiness in your new home taz <3
Oh my god that thing about struggling with processing changes... I relate on another level.. thank you for putting that into words 😭❤️
2020 was quiickkkkk I am still in shock like how are we in 2021
10:10 Tata💜💜
i am so happy to see her grow so much ❤
I love you and this channel!!!!!
TATA is in the video
Cant wait for the apartment tour 😁😀
Thought the laptop was a bath tile :))
2020 for me went soooo quickly so i feel u
I wish I had a friend like taz
Month ago : EXTREME FLAT TRANSFORMATION Now           :  IM MOVING!😃👍
don't you just finnish decorating your house? but anyway i so proud of you 👏🏻
Did anyone else notice that Taz got emotional so many times in the video talking about moving out....Love you Taz❤️
2020 didn't even really happen in my memory. Cause nothing really happened so when I think about last atumn I think about autumn 2019...
Of course the landlord is trying to sell the flat. U completed a full renovation! U have done so many things, painting, decorating, turning that place into a lovely home! I'm so sorry u had to leave. I hope the landlord is thankful for you because you have done more for his flat than he did for his own property! On the positive note, I'm looking forward to the new videos at your new place. Hopefully less drama and disaster this time 😅😂
Amazing
Best of luck Taz, love you! Can't wait for Wednesday.
Ur my twin🤣🤣🤣🤣
Welcome to adulthood. Imagine emptying a house you’d lived in for 20 years. lol
Taz a month ago - extreme apartment makeover Taz now - moving out
im kinda glad you’re moving out from that house coz I think it kinda cursed. hahaha so many things broken
Taz in a 'stud' tee <3 vibes
Very nicey videos Love from pakistan Pls visit my channel too Need your support Kind regards aisha&brother
This is the weirdest thing....that you have to renew a lease....
I love you Taz. Thank you for being so open, you've got me through a lot :)
Can someone be an angel pumpkin and tell me what the song at 1:30 is called?
TOMMY SHIRT TOMMY SHIRT
There was one photo from the photo wall.. She blurred out the other person's face in the video where she put up the photo wall. But she didn't blur it in this video. I am confused..
Can’t wait to be an adult and suffer from being an independent adult 🙂.
Let a new journey begin 🎉🎉🎉
IM EXCITED TO SEE THE NEW PLACEEEEEEE AAAHHHHHHH
You live near meeeeeeee omggggggg
HOL UP- TAZ IM SUCH A BIG FAN IVE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR YEARS IN SO PROUD OF YOU
i feel so bad :(( she spent so much moeney and time repairing this place
2020 felt like it was 10 years long
Can’t wait for the apartment tour! aaaaaah 😱🤩🤯
🤍🤍
My landlord just sold my house so I’m moving next week!
Time flew by fast
I really feel like i went to sleep one day in march of 2020 and suddenly its march 2021
I've also grown during lock down. But sadly more in a belt notch, horizontal growth kind of way.   When the experts say wash your hands and wear a mask, I hear eat a whole packet of Jaffa cakes in one sitting with someCadbury mini eggs as a side dish.
i would’ve been stressed af if i had to find a new place in a short amount of time
panoramic. 17:34 :(
I thought my house owner is rude and crazy but taz your owner is worst
You should check those hard drives every couple years. they can fail with time. So you might need a backup for your backup. Super annoying but sadly, fact.
I'm so sorry Taz to hear that, jeezuz i hope you'll find somewhere more convenient and a better place to live in omg this is so last minute! After all you've done they could Ave at least informed earlier
TL;DR Taz fixed her TV by leaving the bad luck flat
Your tenant just wanted you to renovate it for them 😂
If command strips ruin paint work then it’s not your fault, it means the landlord has cut corners with painting and it shouldn’t affect your deposit if you bring it up with them. They’ll try it but when you mention it they can’t say much...
London was a bad decision.
i'm currently moving for the exact same reason D:
Taz is like future me and is giving me updates of the future how shit is gonna go xD
17:32 "panoramic"?... w-was that intentional? i couldn't tell, but either way, i laughed
For me 2020 went really quick
Will miss this place 😭
Please make agreement this time ❤️
Change of address is a nightmare, worth getting a P.O. Box instead haha
Soo excited for the apartment tour! And getting a fresh new start! And you get to buy your own furniture now!
I start watching your videos when you move to your frist apartment now you are moveing out
Everyone- “More Room Transformations!!”   Me - “Yay! But not for another year proba lmao”
I would NEVER do anything to add to the value of a place I don’t own. The landlord is getting something out of you for free while you’re actually paying them to improve their own property. My sister and brother in law have done the same, I don’t get it! If anything is broken, the landlord needs to fix that. I wouldn’t paint walls even. I’m only getting aesthetics out of it lol. Maybe it’s a British thing? My brother in law is from England so idk but damn, I’d save my money towards a deposit of my own place I can do anything to
I have the hardest time getting rid of clothes!  Especially if it's a unique looking item...even if I don't wear it...I get paranoid that I'll never find it again!
I had bad acne and i used soo many products for my skin but after seeing taz talk abt skin and her skin being clear i switched to using water only and its awesome I have such clear skin now  I'm soo happy
Yayyy!!! Love a thriving queen! Go Taz!!!
It's weird, in Canada you must be given at least 30-60 days notice to move out.  Also glad she's moving out of there tho cuz everything was always breaking!
I hope you get right with this new home you're getting in! Xx 😚 PPK / www.instagram.com/pikpakpokcom/
ive been at my current flat since last year march haha ive been at work but am deffo gonna call this my quarantine flat !
You mention that you are not the most adult in the world, and that you are figuring it out as you go along.  I hate to tell you, I am pretty sure that is what adulting is.  I am quite a bit older than you, and I still wing it and try to figure out stuff as I go.
The landlord owes so much to her for renovating, decorating and even fixing all those appliances, kitchen counter and what not! It was a disaster and Taz made it lovely 🤗🤗

Did she just say panaramic @17:35 ?!
Taz, you’ve been amazing during this weird year! Congratulations on your new home! It looks amazing. Love your work ❤️🤗
Tazzz im moving out on the 1st of april im streeeesssingggg 🥺
I miss glasses taz
I feel like time isent fast or slow it’s just like less relevant so it feels slow but in reality it’s so fast like weeks feel like days and months feel like weeks
I can't wait for the new flat tour!
Feels like you didn't get alot of notice. The new flat looks nice from what we can see though. Seems like it looks alot nicer then your old flat.
I felt that. People used to ask me why my skin is so clear I just say I used water. Then I have to use makeup for performance and my mom I ask me use a skin care cream. N I started breaking out lol sad times
Hey Taz, I don’t know if this helps anyone else but I recommend if your overwhelmed or scared or sad, you just sit in the sun. If it’s sunny where you are just sit outside, out a window, by yourself and just smile at the sky. It helps me and I hope it helps you, and anyone else reading this. 💕
it feels like 2020 is repeating itself !
Taz, I have to apologise to you. I don’t like beans. I’m sorry. 💔
Panoramic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t believe It’s been almost an year since you Moved Out
i can’t wait to be apart of this journey omg- also why am i not surprised that Taz fell down the stairs 😂
Wohooo! Taz has upgraded to a new home. Can't wait to watch the house tour video soon 😆
queen <3
I’m so exited for Wednesday
Your videos are so entertaining! :)
THANK GOD.   BECAUSE THAT FLAT WAS GETTING ON MY DAMN NERVES.
Offer got accepted!!!????Taz did you BUY a new home????? Caught that at the end!!!!!
I Feel like this is going to be me.... been here for a whole year and now i want to decor, but probably not going to stay long...............
😍😍😍
You move out because they want to sell the place but there was a showing for a next tenant?
LMAOAAOO YOU SAID "in a paneramic" at the end LNAOOOA it's a pandemic taz those beans a getting to your brain
2020 was both ridiculously slow and fast. Every day was long and melded into each other which meant when I looked at the date again it was like 2 months later than I remember it being
Good work!
SURPRISE: taz isn’t organised 🤣🤣
I just did a move out of my childhood home into my first apartment I know how you feel Taz ❤️
I discovered the non skin care when young. I too only used water . I figured out soap is what broke me out . I am wayy older so i do need some now but only use organic if i can.
I'm about to move out of my first apartment too, I'm 22 and it was weird when I moved in cause I had to figure everything out like how to get water and electricity, and bills and the deposit and everything. Now that I'm about to move out I'm freaking out because I've got to do it al again, and sometime Im like "Dude, you're an adult, you're supposed to be okay doing this" and It's just refreshing seing that I'm not supposedly adult who's still just trying to figure things out. Also, I hated my apartment when I moved in because I was broke it was kinda gross and all, but now I'm moving out, I'm feeling all nostalgic because it's been my first place on my own. Where I did everything by myself, and also where I spent all the lockdowns and all. Anyways, can't wait for the new apartment tour !!!!! Much love from France, thanks for making me feel like I'm not the only award girl in the world since I started following you a few years ago :)
Taz, I think it's a good idea to rent a small warehouse/studio where you can store your masterpieces, and utilize the space to create more.
Taz is a chaotic yet calm person. It's a talent.
I love how relatable you are! I have an equally hard time getting rid of clothes I know I will probably rarely or ever wear
why is she dressed like Tommyinnit lmaoooo t-t
she said PANORAMIC LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Moving in a panoramic ...I howled😅🤣😂🤣♥️♥️
goodbye old flat 👋 scuffed, but on brand.
Make apartment hunting videos
So sorry Taz. I would be devastated and stressed with such short notice.
“moving in the middle of a panorama” HAHAHhha
girl figuring things out as you go IS adulthood noone knows what they're doing
Ngl I feel like 2020 just doesn't exist in my brain. Like what happened that year? I don't know
Now that Taz spent a year staging the old flat, it'll (hopefully) be a breeze to set up the new place! Good luck & many happy years in the new flat!
Was that moon🥰🥰🥰
Taz: moving in a panoramic! 😁17:34
im learning English but i don't understand the half she's saying
Taz got beanz :0
Didn't you just like- Redecorate and everything?
whyy is she moving
Lol your hard drives....your data center!!! Have you heard of the CLOUD??
My fellow bean cupboard person ❤️
We want diy room decor vids
The place was breaking down as much at the start of her channel 🙂
Moving again nuuu but also YESSSS LETS GOO😭
SKINKEEERE  :D
She reminds me so much of (?/Naomi?🤔) Scott 😅😅
Taz I just wanted to say your videos have made me smile over the last year and realise we are so similar in wanting to make the best out of not so great situations. You have grown and changed in an amazing way and I hope you can continue to make the best out of life and enjoy your new place 😊
I'm wishing that nothing is broken in the new flat ❤️
You can't just throw a bunch of products on your face at once. One you need to get the right products and two introduce them slowly. This is why the videos of 'Did.... For a week.' doesn't work. You don't get results like that.
this actually made me feel sad :( I said to myself that I felt bad for you! you invested sooo much into your old flat - time, energy, money ect, and as soon as everything is coming to finish you have to move out :( I hope you are able to make a ton of new memories in your new apartment now and hopefully it doesn't need as much money spent on it xx spend the money on yourself 🙂 you deserve it Taz. you really do deserve it. ilove you and keep inspiring meee :) ❤️
2:55 I love Taz T-shirt. Lol just sayin'
Glad she is moving ! The landlord of that place should be ashamed of himself !!
Hey Taz! what’s your most favourite hard-drive brand? I want one to store pictures on but am scared it might malfunction and I’ll lose all my pictures😬
Congratulations I am so happy for you!!!! God bless
Sorry to hear you had to move babe💗 you put in so much hard work. Think you added value to the property and wanted to rent again for more money 💰💰💰💯💯💯 idk. Some people are asses.. but nice to see your sorted a new flat, and I bin there changing electric gas phone and just hard work lol.. hope your in this flat for longer this time, and good evening! 😉😏💗Xx
Taz, please can you make a video about how you actually go about setting up gas, electric, internet etc in a new flat?🥰
I just realised i’m a fan of yours for more than a year now wow. I thought it was like a week.
When do you plan on buying a place?
Taz your channel is a very happy place :) It's so nice to see you doing all these adult things, but still being so bubbly and crazy!
Did u say panoramic instead of pandemic    Only taz   Lol
*Taz moves into a flat where everything is broken*  *Taz breaks the wall removing LED lights*  Does this mean you lose the deposit, or can you keep it due to the previously broken stuff?  Good luck in your new home. Wishing you so much joy and thank you for packing us up and taking us with you 💜
Taz don’t use random skincare products use ones like you actually need like a cleanser , moisturiser, a sunscreen and a serum that’s all you need 🥰
Taz, if you don't already, you should depop like all the products you don't use i.e. skincare stuff!!
Good luck on your new venture, Taz ❤
Moving is stressful
Hang on - if the landlord is selling, why is there someone coming to view the flat?
Hey Taz, I really loved the mindset x Personal development section. I hope the best for you sis
I see that you cried/felt sad Taz, don’t be🥺It’s gonna be ok, you are sooooo strong!🌹❤️
What i understood from this video: taz keeps everything because why not
Can’t wait for the moving vlogs taz xx
Taz: "Moving alone... In a Panoramic" Me: wait wut? 😂    17:30
ur shit in the beginning is giving me troy bolton vibes :')
Love ur vids😍😍
“Moving by yourself, especially in a panoramic”😂
This is why I never wanted to rent private. It was always in the back of mind, ‘what if these people want their flat back’
Taz is literally me. Through and through /:. Taz what is your personality type?   Advocate?  Intj-t?
Who else thinks the new apartment is going to be better than the previous one
Oh my gosh Taz, because your moving anyway, you should try the minimalism thing where you have everything you own in moving boxes and you only keep the things that you actively need to unpack to use. It's so brilliant. You do it for like a month or two and then at the end of that, you just get rid of whatever you didn't have to get out of the boxes Xx
Taz you are an amazing woman. You are such a kind person to donate your own food to the food bank.  Your old flat was a stepping stone to the next stage in your life.  Keep up the fantastic videos and we all send our love. x
That’s trash lol.  To just sell up.
Taz you just redecorated 😂😂😂😂😂
11:53 I just noticed that I have the same necklace as Taz!😊
taz maybe do a giveaway for the unused skincare products :)
Can we just acknowledge the fact that taz  has had a glow up over the past year! 💕
Not sure if taz watches the dream smp but the red and white shirt is really reminding me of Tommy XD
17:33 she says panoramic instead of pandemic 😂
Frick I feel you on the timing, I moved countries to the UK Feb 2020 literally a month before the pandemic... I feel that I've grown so much this past year but I can echo the isolating/anxious feelings 1000%
She looks so happy yall I can't
Take the fride and everything u fixed with your money!!!
Why would you save everything on hardrives when things like dropbox exist xD
HER TV WORKS!!! FINALLY!!!
''I'm just a human and I'm just winging it'' could not relate more HAHA I'm 24 now and I'm just going with the flow lol
I always felt so connected to taz 🤗
I hope the kitchen appliances won't break as quickly in the new apartment as in the last one. ;-)
An empty box.... with a MAGNET "lock"..... for harddrives?
Panoramic
Love the new flat! In my opinon better than the old one :) ^-^
How’s moon? <3
I have a serious question.. so like.. everybody knows beans cause gas and bloating... do British people get it too or are you guys immune to the side effects of eating beans?
Even tho it’s sad you had to move your new place do looks prettier and cleaner
SHE SAID IN A PANARAMIC AT 17:33 FJDFHGXK
The fact that the house was a disaster when she moved in and it took her months to make it a home for herself just makes me cry 😭
Wow I'm not late
Silver lining of having a low paid job in an expensive area? Flatmates who take care of the bills and adult stuff :D I'm in charge of the internet and it's stressful enough.
taz is like an older sister fr like she shows us the reality of adulting ly taz
Did Taz just give away food for no reason? Okay okay I know it might go to people who need it(I dont know were she gave it or how it works there) But why didn`t she just bring it to the new flat...
Taz I love you so much, no matter what you always make me smile
PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU MATTER TAZ
17:19 i love that mirror!
the tv knew it was time to move so it broke until you got a new place
Best of luck in the new place taz!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Taz is adulting so well I'm so proud :")
So she is 2 weeks already in the new flat. Can't wait for the new adventures 🤗
i loved all the appearances of Tata/BT21 merch throughout this video haha❤️. congrats on the move!
I keep empty boxes too😂😂
Lmao I know the struggle... came to London 6 months ago with one suitcase and I was living in a flat share, I moved places literally last week and I was shocked at how many things I managed to gather in one  tiny room in that short period of time
Haha the way she said panoramic instead of pandemic at the end... I’m dead😂😵
I feel like this flat is better idk thoooo
5:31 lmao I thought you were just holding a slab of marble then
why was there a viewing of the apartment when the owner wanted to sell the property? O.o who's lying?
Why you just purchase a house ,it's better rent to own
I feel part of your journey, thank you for taking us along with you! I‘m looking forward for the videos in your new place🤩
panoramic?// ;)))
please decorate your new flat more than the old one 😊 e.g making your photo wall a bit nicer. you could create a pinterest board for inspo
17:34 did she just say panaramic ?!?!?!?
My landlord has just said the same that they’re selling so we have to move and find somewhere new, I feel the stress 😭
I will miss the first flat but here is to even more growth for your fans and you!! Love you lots
I just recently moved into my own place and it’s honestly the perfect place for me. I dread the idea of moving out 😪
Good luck in your new flat!
I love your videos so incredibly much Taz!!! 🤎
Loving the new flat so far, the windows are really pretty and it seems really bright!!
Moving in a panoramic 😂  Excited for the house tour tho, the new place looks beautiful and brighht 😍
I love you taz
She's doing the Annitheduck move xD   (Pls someone here who understands)
I love you  so so much 💜💜💜💜
Yay!!! Working TV!!
Am i the only one who doesn't like this landlord?  Super excited to see the new apartment Taz! :)
Ur moving!!! Can h do more transformation videos plsss I loved ur room transformation and yellow is my fav colour as well soo  And btw, it’s a mattress pump well at least I think so
New year, new flat. Congratulations Taz!
Wasn't it in last video that Taz discovered a new light in her flat? I cannot wait for her to discover so much things about this new place!
Just as she started getting comfortable....
Your previous landlord is sus! Doesnt sound genuine to me....
It's just to comforting to know that we're about the same age and that I'm not the only one who's in that akward ''not really knowing how to be an adult, but I'm trying'' phase. All of my friends seem to have their stuff together, and I'm still over here like winging iiiittttt
Everyone needs a Taz in their lives. How could you not be so happy with someone like her around!
"Moving in a PANARAMIC". :P
Taz I wanted to tell you how much your videos inspire me to be better and get out of my comfort zone, and also make my own videos and sharing my story. Thank you!
girl, I feel you! after living in this flat for almost a year, where I almost never legt bcs of lockdown, we're finally cleaning and buying some decoration etc. This is also my first flat, it has seen me complete my master's, find a PhD position and many other things, it's just crazy how time flew by this year!!
You are such an inspiration, you don't even understand! Cant wait for the apartment tour!
TAZZZ. Get a safe for your hard drives. Fireproof locked box.
Taz don't forget to update address on your car insurance.
The Skin care thing happened to me, I never used anything but water, and when I started , my skin broke out, I’m still recovering from it now 😂
Ok but like her new flat looks so much better than the older one
Can't wait to see the apartment tour! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
tax you should get a dog or a cat if its a pet friendly place 😂
I didn't realizw how much I relate to Taz until this video... the maybe-it-will-be-useful-once boxes, the pilling of stuff, the mess-before-order-after method of cleaning, not knowing how to 'adult'...there's just so much stuff That new flat looks soooo good
Awww🥺🥺🥺 Thanks for positive videos Taz
Did anybody notice that she put the "it's fine" mug upside down on the shelf..?
I'm sorry I haven't been catching up on your videos but I am so proud of you hun you are doing fantastic x
I actually think this flat is better
May it be blessed and filled with now happy memories 💙💙💙
"I have way too many beans!" New merch?
The new apartment has so much natural lighting! I love it! Seriously, everything is happening for a reason🥰
What a bs landlord. Smh. 🤬
i discovered Taz last year in  march 2020...and i've gone from just looking at Taz drinking water to putting the video on pause, going to the kitchen, filling a glass of water for myself, back into my room and finally drinking it together with Taz...and yes im proud of how much she's grown...and with her, even i've grown and i am still learning how to grow and Taz is one of my biggest inspirations ( no pressure , no expectations, just be yourself Taz)  and thank you so much... also Taz, if you see the comment,  please like it just so i know you've read it...because i dont usually comment much   :')
Yayyyyy
It definitely feels like you just moved in a week ago as well! Time definitely flew by because I myself, can't believe my 1st year moving into my place is coming up.
I always used to use water and a boots your good skin face wash once a week, as soon as I started using more products I broke out so back to water and a sensitive skin face wash 😂
New house tour plz😂🐼🐨🐼🐼
Thats very normal tazz having different Esthetic clothers its a normal thing
i relate to you so much o.m.g.
already moving? :( you loved your place so much !
SO PROUD OF YOU TAZ😭❤️
I cant wait for Wednesday
Why are you so relatable?!
taz's landlord:ok shes made this dump amazing -  lets sell it - its like hiring a home designer!
This is so weird! I moved out of my first flat on March 1st too😂
your new place has amazing lighting
I move in about 1 1/2 month that will be my 4 th flat within the last 5 years.  its the first one i feel like i will be living in for a couple of years i am already so exited
It really does feel like yesterday when I found out you were moving. I can just remember so vividly watching you look for a flat with moon or just complain about your broken ass fridge.
haha kinda random but you look like cristina from divergent
Goodbye Pandemic apartments and hello to the new apartments which by the way looks wow ❤️💪🏼Go Taz
Sorry to be nosey but if the landlord is planning to sell then why is there going to be a tenant potentially moving in after you leave? Love you by the way and wish you all the happiness in your new place❤️
Can u please give out shout outs because we all love u 💟
For like a sec I thought u dicided to move cuz not having a good time. But good you feel better and like how u are.  Like seeing organize and declutter and stuff like that
Are you moving in with your bf
Why the fuck am I emotional? I don't know why this house has so much sentimental value to ME. I did not even live in this house! Please someone assure me that it's not just me with the weird feelings.
Panoramic 🤣
What’s the song at 1:40?
Thank you for always being yourself. Your channel was truly a happy and safe place for me
17:33 uhhh??? panoramic? you mean... pandemic??
I can relate so much to not being able to let go of clothes 😂😂💙
Looooove watching you beautiful Taz😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
"moving, especially by yourself, in a panoramic...is quite the experience" I bet it is 😂 Love the vlog Taz. A bit sus that your landlord claims to be selling but is immediately booking viewings though. 😬
We will always remember the pandemic apartment 😔✊ ( too many memories 😪)
The standards for leasing in the uk seem low. The condition of things in your apartment would not fly in the us.. panel’s falling off walls appliances not working properly last minute move out notification. Yikes!
Tap congrats moving again! You can do it
2020 went so fast, I feel like it didn't even exist..
Wait...didnt she say that the owner wanted to "sell" the flat...but then later she mentions that the new "tenant" was gonna come see the flat...?....i m confused
Are you a Tommy in it fan?
I’m moving soon and this is my motivation to clean and pack. Bless Taz!
Congrats on your new adventure Taz 💙💙💙
I moved last year in the first Lockdown from Belgium. It was nervewrecking. Only 1 person could come help. And it was so hard to rent a van. Everything was closed. And k don't own a car. It was so stressfull. Never again. Next time i move and their might be a pandemic again. I cancel everything.
Can you tell me where you got that space blanket from pleaseeeeeees Also I hope you love your new flat 😃
Your plant! 😢
Taz: this is the most important box My brain: more important than the TARDIS?!
dang when you were on the roof part talking i nearly started crying. i am so happy about how far you have come taz you deserve every piece of love you get. love you and your videos so much.
What a beautiful room you have in your new flat! It's lovely.
I GOT THE BIGGEST CRUSH ON HER SO BEAUTIFUL
12 People who downvoted: Skincare product CEO's
It made a good video :) :) :)
Omg it was Qatar Airways I’m from Qatar ☺️
Wow... you really bought a shit ton of clothes.
She just discovered the new light in the kitchen
It's crazy to think that about a year ago, taz moved into her flat, it literally feels like yesterday!
17:34 in a panoramic...? pandemic? congrats for moving and adulting !! <33
I think u meant pandemic lol instead of panoramic 😆
❤💞👍
Lucky the landlord didn't sell out from underneath you and give you 24 hours to move all of your YouTube purchases out on the street
Are you sure your landlord can do that to you?
Oooh excited to see your new flat!! I hope the new place brings you joy like your last place!! 🥰
Hey Taz, me myself is also in the process of moving and i am always stressed out with how chaotic everything was.. seeing how you portrayed everything in this video so truthfully makes me feel a lot better, just wanna say thanks for being true with who you are.. I rarely post comments although i have been watching your videos for quite sometimes, but this video hits quite close to home for me so yeah.. have a great day!
Why am I emotional, I don't know I love the look of the new apartment already but the old one was so special
From what I’ve seen the flat was a fucking nightmare lol
The big box stores in the US (like Walmart) sell portable wardrobes/closets that are about 4-5 feet tall that have a rack or two for hangers and shelves on the bottom, covered in fabric or vinyl with zipper or click closures. They're usually about $20-25 US dollars. You could probably order one online and have it shipped to you. Have you tried Bush beans? So good.
The new house actually looks really beautiful
Oh my gosh, yes I feel 2020 went super quick but I also felt that I was so busy... Doing nothing 😅
I am soooo happy for taz💟💟💓💓💓💜💜💜
I feel like the landlord owes you a lot for all the much needed renovations you did to the place to make it livable
I used to only use witch hazel and some dove face soap and I think my face was also clearer 😳 before discovering Hyram and stuff. Now I’m in a rabbit hole of buying more and more skin care to fix problems it most likely caused
Cant wait for Wednesday 🥰
Ur videos remember me of my childhood alot  idk why , its very warm and  loving  there's something about u something very pure  💜 I just wanted to to tell u that 💜
Does Taz support lgbtq? 🧝🏻‍♀️
I moved out of our first ever house (that we bought) after 10 years of living there 2 years ago, to move to a different country. I HAD to get organised in advance and the best advice I can give is to write numbers on boxes and colour code them very visibly (eg, pink for kitchen, blue for bedroom etc). Jot down a list of main items comprised in the boxes (that are numbered). This helps A LOT!
the video where you moved to this flat feels like it's been uploaded 2 months ago i just can't believe how a year has passed and i feel scared and intimidated by time
instead of spending weeks on math theories that i have never had to use in my adult life, I'm 53. i wish we could have had a class my senior year called adulthood 101.  what laws change when you turn 18 and then at 21. how to do taxes( what to keep and what to trash). how to move. what contracts and leases are and the laws binding them. how banking works. how to be a tenant, what you can and can't do and what the landlord can and can't do.  labor laws. how to deal with law enforcement. there are 1000s of lessons that would have been used everyday that no one covered.  my parents tried but...ya adulthood 101 public schools need to make it a thing.   would student loans big such a problem if high schools taught loans and interest?
Anyone happy for her but still kinda sad??? just me? and tbh i feel as if   she only just started to feel comfy in her own flat im really excited to see how she grows more as a person!
Two videos this week ..hurray
You left your fake tree behind!! No!! I love that tree! PS please say you bought that desk it is soooo cute
Ima get me a girl like taz
I'm moving out this week aswell so I feel your pain. Also my flat decided to have a mouse infestation so now I've gotta deal with that b4 I move out bruh
Thank you so much for this video, I have watched all your videos but this one resonated with me so much. I've recently moved out from my husbands house and we are separating after 7 years. I'm now going through the roller-coaster of emotions that you described.
Now I guess taz can decorated her new room again, 7:38 "It's completely my life on a hard drive"... Finally the tv got fixed 😄
I can officially say I witnessed Taz move in and out of her first flat!
Love you lots!
you know it hurts watching her move out but i guess its for the better
She's moving
I love when u upload man, thank u so much for entertaining us all!!💓💓💓💓💓
I've been watching for 2 years now, it's so crazy to see you grow as a person
Are we just ignoring that she said "moving in a panoramic" ???? yes, okay..
Moved 3 months ago haha I feel your struggles
*Who else can relate to taz?..* 🤨  *No I don’t mean relating to her moving out* 😑    *I mean struggles at doing everything and is sooo confused 24/7,* *oh but still trying to do tingz* 😐  Nope, just me.. I figured...  😔✌️
Panoramic hhahhha
Taz pls make video and featur a blast from the past. Memories from all those hard drive!!!
Finally !!! Someone said it. I have been noticing that skincare products are actually breaking out good skins. Thanks Taz. No beauty guru will accept that as for them money(sponsor) is more important than giving out true information.
I feel like finishing decorating just before moving out is very on brand for Taz 😂
i had to do a double take bc i thought this was an old video recommended to me, then i saw the title and i got a bit :c bc i've grown attached to your flat as well. but i'm hoping to see more of your new content in your new flat uwu take care, taz!! <3
Setting a reminder for Wednesday for the video
The new flat looks so nice!!
Taz what type of tape did u use for hanging those photo frames? I desperately need them
17:34 "panoramic" 😂
He wont be selling it he just be saying it so he can rent it to someone for more they just dont wanna say it to you because of pandemic. I was told the same thing so was someone else i know literally same story. its mad they either raise the price just like that like no one cares or lie so they can make money of of someone else ....
Watching your videos makes me happy... And less anxious...❤️😊👍
SO EXCITED FOR THE NEW FLAT TOUR
Learning so much by watching your videos
I have moved 5 times in the past six years and I still don't know what I'm doing when it comes to switching utilities 😬
Love your videos and you,, thank you 💝
Im so glad that moving bills is not a thing in my country if you are renting, except for phone/tv/internet
I remember when u first moved in you complained about the hob haha
Please do a meal prep
LMAO Taz alone probably donated a week's worth of food 😂😂😂
Taz!! Please use a sunscreen for the hyperpigmentation. I am guessing you got pimples because you might have over-exfoliated your skin. Just use a sunscreen in the morning and a very basic moisturizer in the night (no exfoliants)
Hey taz id love if you tried libyan food for 24 hours no one really knows libyans and if you usally look up libya you will just see photos of war. id really appricate if you did so ❤
your skin also depends on the food u eat and changing your diet a lot.
My skincare routine is focusing on my diet, and the nutrition I choose to put in my body. I used to think i needed a skincare routine. Then I started a health journey 2 years ago, and transformed my life and health 💞 my skin, not just on my face but overall, has been the best it's ever been in my life. And I have eczema 😊
I love the honesty that you share in your videos. Continue to grow and blossom into the beautiful human you are meant to be.
The more I stare at Taz ...the more I find her pretty ❤️❤️❤️
Sending all the positive vibes to the new Taz pad!! 💞💞
wishing you all the best in the new flat. I'm moving in just over a month and can't  be arsed packing 🤦🏻😅
I'm so proud of taz, for getting through that ‘lonely’ phase and facing everything w absolute optimism. Much power to u, girl❤️
You save the empty boxes bcoz that's what we've been taught to do as asians😂
<3
Yaayy looking forward to the tour!!! 😍😍
3:16 Taz describing me in a nutshell and me watching like 👁️👄👁️
I relate to much to the moving part, i moved out to my first own place a week before your first apartment video was posten. And i agree with you! It doesn't feel like a year at all! And all the personal development you feel you have gotten, i can see myself in everything you are saying. Good luck in your new flat 💕
Panoramic? Get some sleep Taz...
Taz I think you mean't pandemic not panoramic haha
Note to self: never skip ads on taz’s videos  She is an amazing human being and one of the only you tubers who deserves it Also, I know what I’m watching on Wednesday
Why didnt you take with you, all the food you had in storage (since you will be needing it in order to Feed-and beans are always welcomed) and why did you let that plant (saw it when the door was closing) in your old flat? :/
this was my sign to start packing again lol
I can't wait for your apartment decorating videos!!!!!
Awww...I kinda feel like I am attached to this place too. So so proud of you Taz.  Love ya 💛
My girl movin I’m so happy for her and by the way it’s amazing you get 3.2k in one hour take care every one
Good bye Photo wall!!! We hope we see you again!!!!😔😢
i’m at school right now but this video is more important lol
17:34 Taz did you just say “iN a PanOrAmIC?” Do you mean pandemic by any chance? ❤️
I‘m so excited for the content that is coming up 🙆🏼‍♀️
i read the title and I said noooo so many memories were made in this flat
17:34 she said “...in a panoramic...” instead of in a pandemic
:0 the tommyinnit shirt at the start but long sleeved :0
i love ur personality 😌✨
I'm in a weird mood right now, so that made me cry, but IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU TAZ!!! <3 <3 <3
So happy your moving up girl ❤️☺️
I love moving vlogs! Yeeeey
As they are selling everything in West London... Especially that area you in ( I assume I know where it is cuz I lived near there for a while) still sad I never seen u 😢
10:50 you legit look like ur gonna fall off ur chair lmaoooo cue disaster
I love that Taz is happy. She makes me happy 😊
Congratulations Taz!!!!! I am so happy for you and so proud of you!!!!😭😭😭😭❤
I LOVE YOU
Love you so much, Taz. 😘
omg I'm so excited for you tazzzz
She actually did do it  Okay soo she didn't really plan for it, but it is actually starting all over again
Love you so much
When i move, i start packing about 10 days before move. Just start with odds and sods you wont need until your moved into new place. When you get to about 7 days from move, concentrate on packing up a room per day. Its really easy this way and avoids panic and anxiety of last minute packing.  PS @ClickForTaz ......Branston Beans are way tastier than Heinz beans ;)
Loved this vid taz!    The last couple of videos you seemed ever so slightly off?  Like not your completely positive happy self and I imagine this was probably why now 😅 it’s completely fine to feel not 100% btw as I’m sure you know.  Just hope you’re taking breaks if you need too ❤️  Love from a longtime fan xxx
Taz we Stan your beers collection
3:33 sammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmme
You moving info the new house on the first of march, girl its 15th and u upload a moving vlog. I see u have a buzy life xD 👽🤙🏿
pls pin my comment, im a huge fan
17:31 moving in a panoramic. haha
also good bye taz's firsts flat
I cant wait to see the new flat videos, makes me excited for my move too. Good luck with it all Taz
omg hi taz i love ur vids
✨
right when im moving back to uni
never been so early!
The growth !!!🔥 So proud ❤️❤️
can someone explain to me what she means by panormic
The old flat was fine but this one seems BOMB
17:44 panoramic, pandemic
Taz, I think you shouldn't give up on having a skincare routine. The problem probably was trying a looot of different products and changing them too often ( it kinda happen to me lol). But now I just stick to cleansing, moisturizing and sunscreen and everything if fine
Did she say panoramic or was it just the subs?
Ohhhh  I have a bad behaviour that I hate when my life details change I can handle it like easily but in deep of my head it's just too annoying I don't even like to see my pictures often  right now I'm missing you ex house 😂😂😂 Hope you could have a better ideal house suitable with your thoughts
pandemic  taz: a panoramic
Hopefully this year solo travel taz can make a comeback 😂🥳🙏🏼
At least your new flat should have a working kitchen ahaha
bro I’m so proud of you  Literally watched you grow up for the past 3 nearly 4 years. Sad taz Solo travel taz  Independent taz Just know that I love you and keep your head up queen xx 💛
Strong independent women rule 💪❤️
Love you taz so much and i hope you enjoy your new apartment
Wait the potential new tenant coming but the flats being sold 😕
new flat tour! :)
Plot twist: Taz was *actually* evicted because she flooded the kitchen with Heinz Beanz
She first say “the landlord wants to SELL the flat” then a bit later  she is like “someone wants to come and see the flat like the next tenant” ?!?!?
You know it's not taz without her featuring beans mostly in all her videos
Moving by yourself sucks. Period.
Can't wait for the apartment transformation in 9 months Love you taz
“Adulting for the win” I love you so much💗💗💗
Aawwe tazzz... Sorry, but this is London.. it's harsh.. we're planning to move to the countryside because London is just too much about the money.. anyway, chin up! You'll be fine! ;)
I saw taz say on her caption on Instagram something about moving and it got me soooooo hyped yk
I think boxes are the only things I don't throw away, cos I like to keep things off sight, so you never know where it might get useful!
Taz just make me feel like a proud mum, proud sister, proud friend, proud daughter and everything proud. I'm gonna meet her one day ❤️
This is the real women power not to brag but to do the stuf in background and telling everyone that u did it already and no one can say that u can't do it   More power to you taz we all love you coz of this attitude of your, to never give up 😎😎😎 all the best on your new apartment with new beginning and more dreams
It is so amusing to watch how everyone is moving this feb/march. I will hve to move to two place within a week!
The same thing happened to me 😭😭
I downsized and used minimalism to declutter incase I have to move, moving makes you understand what you want and don't want. I've moved twice in ten years
I moved my flats back in 2014 it was the easy process because I used to box all my clothes, just would do swap over from winter clothes to summer clothes, 👍 But it was HELL helping my friend (plus 4 children) move from her two bedroom house to a bigger house in two weeks (this was during the Christmas holidays and we work in school), she had so many stuff, thank god she had tow teen sons.
just a reminder, landlords don't contribute anything to society and are leaches 🤪
Why am I so attached to this house thats not even mine 😭😭😭 She grew so much here in this space. So many first times and a whole lot of memories were made. Seriously a whole year went by so fast.
sorry am I the only one who heard her say 'panoramic' instead of pandemic 😂
They just wanted someone to ckme in qnd fix everything then kick you out smh.... im sure they knew they wanted to sell 🙄 but failed to mention that when renting smh.... im glad your moving i never liked that run down place lol
I love that you took a moment to reflect about how you have grown Taz. Huge reason why I love your channel and honesty. You did it! So proud and hopeful for your future 🥰🥰💙💙
Taz - for your hard drives - you should buy a fireproof safe. Put your important documents in there as well. That way you won't lose them if there is a fire...
You should use benzoyl peroxide  on pimples it really helps because it dries out the pimple and it stop growing bigger and please message it in and don't leave it on because i BURNT my skin and use benzoyl peroxide 2.5%
All the girl wants is to create a cosy place to chill and then the universe is like "nah you gotta move out hun"
Taz: finishes decorating  also Taz: moves out
Finally I could say im early!!! Taz you kinda remind me of Lisa from blackpink, you guys both share the same type of humor💕
i  have never been so early [she only been living there for only month ] the simple fact she collect a year worth of clothes during the pandemic
Curious ques!!.In the movie divergent, which faction would taz get sorted into. I relate a lot to taz and i think i would get into abnegation... Someone let me know your thoughts
Taz have you ever considered having an autism assessment?!! (not being at all rude or meaning to assume) just some things you experience x
hiiii looking forward to seeing your new flattttt
Where is moon? Sorry if I didn't get her name right😅 (Her friend)
Omg I have never been this early on taz’ videos and seeing taz just really cheers me up! Thanks for being such a sunshine in our lives! ☀️ I am really excited for you and the next videos that’ll hopefully be about you decorating your new place! When one door closes, another one opens!!!❤️
Taz has become my favorite YouTuber and Im HERE FOR IT, love uuu❤
I really felt you Taz when you were talking about your attachments to that place.  Before the pandemic, I have been living with my boyfriend in a 12 m2 dorm room. Everyone was saying that it must be horrible for two people to have such a tiny place, even tho we tried to bring the most out of it. But as the pandemic came, we were told to move out in the span of 2 days. I couldn't even process it until the next day I woke up in my family home, feeling devastated.  My point is that it is so special to have a place you can call your own. And that you can make any place special by filling it with memories.
moving in a panoramic- classic taz!
Your videos give us so much comfort...I can't even explain
17:34 We are in a "PANORAMIC".  🤔🤣
OMG SHE'S MOVING AGAIINNNN
The place you've been living at has SCREAMED first apartment (I can definitely relate), so been waiting for you to find another place hahah! I also feel like it will be extra nice seeing as you've been spending like 90% of your time inside the past year!
You made your house look so nice and then you had to move 😂
Watching your videos make me feel like I’m caching up with a friend lol
17:34 in a panoramic 😭😭😭 Love your videos 😆
Can't believe you are moving again, especially after you just gave it a makeover!! (What a shame about your landlord changing his mind) but maybe be good to be away from the bad memories of lockdown and things breaking down in the flat (including you) 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️ Good luck in your new home Taz xx
Anybody else clock on that she firstly says her landlords selling and then says the next tenant possible tenant is going to view tomorrow? Or is that just my over thinking brain 🤣 LOVE YOU TAZ CLICKED SO FAST X
Wait wait DIDNT you just decorate your apartment? When did moving come in
Woo new video! Cant wait for a new decorating video 😎
The top that she was wearing in the first 14 seconds just made me think about tommyinit.
Yayyyy
Puts up decorations, then takes them down in the process 🌠destroys🌠 apartment. 😂
Taz: (11:50) life stoped Me: umm.. that means you died
Give us a flat tour
Love u taz ❤️
You moved in a year ago??? I swear that was 2 months ago damn
Everyone: getting likes for their good comment Me: thinking what comment will be good
Can't wait for the apartment tour video😁😁
Taz you were just decorating the flat, now you’re moving! Time flies by so fast! I hope you enjoy your new home :)
In a panoramic? Is that what people call the pandemic now? Accurate. Never ending.
5:46 yep all that "fun" adult stuff. I moved out in January with my mum and im only 15 and i had to do all that adult stuff myself since my mum cant speak English. And lets say i struggled alot but managed on my own. 😔😔
Taz repping the tommyinnit shirt
You are strong taz....and you made me strong...love you loads...make us smile more👍you are rocking
17:31 Taz: moving, especially by yourself in a "panormic".... Me: ??? do you mean pandemic? xxx
I just hope you took a longer lease this time :-)
taz you said paranaramic instead of pandemic lol
Blink of an eye and 2020 is gone  If yes then like if no then comment
We are all "just wingin' it" dear Taz lol
Taz you should really invest in storing your photos/videos into the cloud just incase something happens to your hard drives!
Why you moving
landlords are such trash
4:49 3:17 why is she so relatable
*sees that taz has uploaded a new video* happiness restored ❤️
I am moving at the end of this month and I started preparing weeks ago and I still don't feel ready at all. I hate packing and moving and everything around it. I have bags and bags of things to take to Recycling Centre to throw away. I have also accumulated a lot of boxes from work to pack into. I wanted all of it to be organised but I think I will end up throwing everything from my drawers and shelves into random boxes. I wonder if anyone will be able carry it tho.
2020 went extremely fast. Great video Miss Taz
Lovely vibes of the new apartment tho 💗
If you have to move because the landlord is selling, why is there potential tenants coming to view the flat?
In regards to skincare - you might have been using too much things at the same time that have been breaking you out.  Try one product at a time- that will help a lot more
i don't even know why because i have never been to this flat or paid much attention to it but i will miss it
Taz just decorated her apartment and its time to MOVE!!🌼
Good job! Ya did it 👍
hang on, the landlord wanted taz out because they wanted to sell the flat, then a potential new tenant is coming to view.  Sounds like the lordland just wanted Taz out.
Taz, you just finished decorating, how are you moving??? I am so confused
17:35 panoramic? Lol I think you meant pandemic but tax I’m so happy for you and I’m happy your mindset has changed hope mine will to
Awesome! Moving is so fun *tears stream down* ... I love the FINE mug. Mine is my friend during essay time.
very proud of you
No no no no no no no, PLEASE don’t keep your memories and data on hard drives! If you insist on keeping that old stuff, PLEASE make sure to upload it to some cloud provider (one with proper security measures). I learned this the hard way and had to painstakingly recover thousands of photos from a hard drive that was failing.
Such a British thing to have full cupboard of baked beans ❤️
THE REACTION I HAD WHEN I SAW THIS VIDEO- im so happy for u , cus that apartment is just not it- im so happy u moved!!!!! :> . Just finished watching ur vid , ur new flat is literally such a good place its so natural and cute! Ahhh im so exicteddd for ur new apartment
marie kondo had a heart attack watching this video :D
17:34 in a panomaric
I live for taz honestly she’s the only thing keeping me going x
It is just soo amazing that I have saw Taz grow up and get out of her depression in front of my eyes I am in  love with her💕
Aww taz I hope the new apartment is even better and more memorable than the last one ❤️
i have a very good reason for all the beans its because you're British, we all have a collection
So proud of you Taz , big life changing moment and you handled it like a champ :)
But you just redecorated your house !!!!;
I clicked faster than Taz could regret the decision of decorating her apartment 😪
Taz you should just buy a house I’m sure your parents would help you
Taz moved out !!!! It feels like it was just  yesterday that she just got the flat 😅
2020 felt short and long at the same time
L
an empty box is never useless... you never know when a cat needs it!
U did great taz!!  I'm so proud of u💜💜💜💜
The first time we've seen her in a shop in a year..
I just love how well she is coping with all of this, like I would have just start to cry at every point. YOU ARE A TRUE INSPIRATION TAZZZ!!!!!!
I love how she just a breaks something and tries doing he save because she wanna be cheap 😌
Dude just have a cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. Oh and exfoliate. That's all you need, Paula's choice, the Inkey list and CeraVe have amazing products and I suggest you follow SkinCare by Hyram, or a dermatologist. No need to overdo your skincare routine
I love that tas is British like me so she post at a normal time and not when I'm sleeping
I HAVE THE SAME BDY
The new landlord is so lucky..
WAIT TAZ YOU HAVE THE PROCESSING THING TOO?? ITS LITERALLY THE ONLY WAY MY MIND WORKS 💀
Omggg tazzz i'm moving too but for the first time ever! (At least if they give me the studio) 🤣
Im so produkt of you taz
Hey, I love how much art you have and I'd like to gift you my art book I did at the beginning of this year! I feel like you'd really appreciate it <3
17:30 moving in a PANORAMIC hey? that's a new one ;)
This is just sad. When Taz was decorating she did say then when I’m done it’ll be time to move again and that’s what happened 😣😓
Taz literally forgot about hoddies 3:35
the fact you redecorated a month ago- I'd be so mad
I just wanna comment something nice for Taz..
Finally moving out of that house, literally everything was breaking 😭. And you were just getting comfy too 😩
Nooo.. not the Heinz bean collection.. :(
Okay but can we just talk about Taz's character development
Can't wait for a tour of the new place ♥️♥️♥️
ily taz
The way I just fiinished watching your home makeover series and now you're moving 😅
Hey take u should know u are so special and u moving out of ur flat is going to be a big roller coaster so I want to say from the taz army we love you
TAZ i love you so much
That flat had a lot of issues but just to let you know that unless your landlord has given you a section 21 eviction notice, you don’t have to leave. Plus you can deny access to viewings. It’s the law that you get quiet enjoyment of your space. And if your landlord tries to deduct money, dispute it through the deposit protection scheme. Do not agree to give him any money. Feel free to message me if you need more advice. Best of luck in your new place ❤️
👍
A lot of people are allergic to fragrance in skincare products. Maybe you are also
so excited to see the new flat
From completely useless to probably the most important box .... Levels
Ahh taz !! Will miss this flat, although the new flat might be exciting...
This is currently so relatable for me omg, I'm going into my final year of uni this summer and I've been sorting out a new place to live, WHICH HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL. And I'm feeling so much doubt and am absolutely terrified by how much stuff I've built up over lockdown. But you made feel a bit less stressed about it all. Now I wait for two days for the flat tour.
what? a year? really? we spent a year in the flat? doesnt feel like it omg
Me: Sees the title Also me: Didn't she just redecorate like a month ago
@ 7:06 I mean to be fair, I would keep that box as well. It's a good box!!!
@17:32 moving in a panoramic?
Made my sister watch this and now she's gonna watch you all the time now. Congrats one the move💕💕
She’s got soo much cash from YouTube I think she’s gonna move to Mayfair
im so proud of you for dealing with this so well, you go girl
did you mean to say panoramic instead of pandemic..? haha
Have courage Taz! Moving (on) is hard so I'm proud of you! You go girl, you got this!
I think u should use bio oil for your skin to get rid your acne cus i use that for my acne and it works well
pov: ur early bc you were stalking her
Looks like u ll like living in the new apartment 😁
Can't wait  for ur wednesday video!
*casually has a baked bean collection* - girl your so iconic I can’t  ✋🤠✨
Hyped for the upcoming Wednesday flat tour!! 🙌🏻
This was an unexpected video
Omg why did you leave but I hope it's for the best
who helped you in moving out coz i don't think so you can do all this moving out stuff alone😂
17:35
Loveeeeeeeee = taz❤❤
Okay okay everyone knows the truth that the landlord made taz fix all the problems like the sink/broken window etc, now they're kicking her out LOL no hate omg but I'm so happy for u and how confident you've becomee!! 🥺💖
Omg I clicked so fast😭
Your so cute
Congratulations Taaaaz! 🎊🎉💐
omg ur apartment has so many memories. BUT IM SOOO HAPPYYY FOR UUUU!!!❤️❤️❤️
Skincare is a scam. My skin always gets horrible when I try to improve it smh...
Taz’s videos are the ones I can just drop everything and watch it immediately for the full length ❤️ Best of luck in your new flat and thank you for sharing your memories and thoughts from your ‘pandemic flat’! 😊
I just hope all the work you done was fully covered by your landlord, or at least be reimbursed. Man... the work you put into that "crappy apt where everything had to go wrong"  But hey, this also means new adventure ahead of you! ❤
you should try cerve
I completely agree about having so much stuff-moving between home and uni/moving rental flats made me realise how much unnecessary stuff we have!
why is everyone i watch moving houses??!? like, can i move too lol
wut hello?! im early?!
This legit broke my heart after all the hard work you put into improving that flat...I was screaming NOOOOO when you took down the photo wall! But can't wait for a tour of the new place xox
I’ve so many screenshots of your videos. I don’t know why.
I feel the same way about clothes. On the off day i need it, i won't have it
Omg omg omg I'm early
guys I think she likes beans
HELLOOOO
Oh I can't wait to see where life will take you next! New flat, new opportunities!
Hopefully the stove in the new kitchen works
The one thumbs down is from the landlord 👀
taz is so me
She worked so hard on the decoration and now she's moving haha
ma’am you gave us no warning
Hi taz, My emna and im from Tunisia i just hope that you notice me you are my favorite youtuber and i hope someday i become like you i think that sosial media in genaral needs more people like you because every where i look i just see people that are trying hard to look perfect and that's the main reason that made me like you💜💜💜
Have you ever felt that your so excited that you came early, but then doesn't know what to comment 😕😕.  But anyway love you loads Taz, all the best with the new flat 😍❤️❤️
buy another wardrobe. That solves the issue. Then you can keep your clothes. 🤣🤣👌🙈  seriously though, for all the face care stuff. the skin care, if the box is unopened, sell it for a cheaper cost. as a full set. So say if for a total set you paid £120 sell it as a whole lot for £70. Someone is going to realize that your giving them a deal. I know you won't get all the money back but getting most the money is better than getting none of the money back.
Taz how can I send u art I made ? Should I contact ur insta or business email ?
nice
I am beginning to think that I and Taz are literally the same person😂 Congrats on the new flat and love you by the way❤❤
