You should maybe get decent tyres for the equipment you use
parfait le nouveau plateau de charge
WAS THE PERSON DRIVING THAT THING DRUNK!
"who needs a rock crusher when you got a roller" that aged like a open container of milk in florida.
Just like Austin powers😂😂😂
......and it tried to kill him. LOL - good instints Andrew
با موتور همین وسایل که خراب میکنی میشه وسایلی ساخت که زمستان به کار بیاد
I think Andrew has mower issues
Thank you for making Videos while Diving, Take Care of you.😮
LAWNMOVER HAD IT COMMING!
Thanks!
Yes I like watching these video's on our TV and This Laptop Thumbs up DAILY
Did you ever find someone who could fix your lawn mowers?
ROAD ROLLER DA!! WRYYYY!
En vez de romper destruir no construyes realizas caminos casas algo constructivo... Todo es destrucción y daño ..
I think the mowers pretty flat
😅❤😂🎉😢😮😮😊😊😅Fututi. Tktitii😂😂❤😊😅
Even after watching his videos I learn new things. Keep doing more.😮
cool roller
Andrew you are the best and separate from the rest. You're one of a kind so  always  keep that in mind.
Please you have how many son & doughter..andru...?
Andru how many son you have..?
It’s often frightening to watch you deal with weight and vehicles.  You go-fast atv, UTV, snowmobile guys are dangerous playing games with a big road roller.  Down the hill in the woods is where it belongs.  Keep you from any number of clownish games for a while.
Camarata Tree Removal service has become a pretty sophisticated operation.
"alright, that's how that looks"  🤣
what  was your purpose of crushing things?
What type of tester you used?
Is that a New Loader from last year?
No doubt the next video will reverse the situation with you winching away from the embankment but downhill 😊keep up the good work Andrew I'm a keen fan 😅
Its been a while since I recovered tanks so I'm no expert but looking at your roller situation two things came to mind.. Not only were you winching up a steep embankment but you were also winching up a steep grade..
Bro i really needed a mower but there u go destroying 2 😂😂
When you have a bad feeling about a piece of equipment even before you drive it off the trailer, you know it's going to go south 😂
I love skid steers. The newer New Holland C245 is a badass but Wayyyyyyyyy overpriced like all big name machines!
If I were to buy a roller I think I would have done the same stuff Andrew did only I would have crushed a junk 4wheeler because I don’t have a junk mower. Lol  It’s scary how much this guy and I think alike! 😂 😂 😂
Супер! Но нет умения в данной обстановке!(
Phá
Well getting the roller up the hill was a total cluster ! Wrong equipment all the way when you have bulldozers !  In the cable pull you should have had 2 snatch blocks , “1” at the roller & another on a second tree above the road !
Ok after watching you use your dump truck & dumping that shale on the road 2’ deep (a total waste) 6”” would have been plenty , I said you should have a -SHEEP foot roller to bust up the rock & pound it in , then use your dozer  or grader !  So is it possible to change to smooth roller for a sheep foot ??
superjamesmccluskey
Andrew Its COOL Video
I saw a roller with an enclosed cabin. Andrew do a little video content on that and maybe other acquisitions you haven't filmed, if you can.
He needs sum MILK!
What do you do with all these machines
Between Water-based Engine Oil, Liquid Metal Gear Oil, and this merry bunch sending her down a cliff…. this Roller has 9 lives. Absolutely unkillable.
Ignorable fire😂
TRADUIRE EN FRANCAIS C'EST IMPéRATIF..merci
Has anyone seen my lawnmower, I left it round here somewhere, but for the life of me, I can't remember where.
joke @ 12:18 made my day :)
Outstanding job!!!
You don't set priorities on this video. Fix the brakes first then have fun crushing mowers.
Boys will be boys with their new toy.😂😂😂😂😂🥰🥰🥰🥰
а где у вас был бульдозер с лебёдкой тот тяжелее и лебёдка мощней
where's the video from our ride on the 4th
مبدع جدا بس ياليت بدون موسيقي  صوت المعدات طرب والمعدات الصناعية
Andrew what would happen if a truck speed past and chopped your arm off never stick your arm out the window of a vehicle even if it's parked
12:21  Andrew should have cut to a shot of him using the circuit tester on the mower and mumbling to himself "I don't know why it won't start".
what did the lawn mower ever do to you? lol
You wont be happy until you hurt or kill some body be more careful.
dum
That gradall looked cool, I like the ones with tires and 2 cabs they look like very useful machines
Great use of those self propagating Deer Poles!
Chuck norris isn’t the winner of the badas competition anymore. Andrew is the one and only nr 1💪🏻👑
More money than sense!
I want to see the video where they took that push mower to the repair shop 😂
it’s a good practice to open the fill before the drain just in case the fill is seized shut
Are they all smoking crack while trying to get that roller up the hill? Like watching Homer Simpson. Nature keeps reminding them every 30 seconds gravity pulls down hill, yet they keep forgetting and do little to block behind any of the vehicles.
Pull it out down the path not up.
Your roller tires need one of these ... 400w Truck Tire Grooving Blades Groover Iron Truck Trailer Tire Rubber Grooving Iron
I guess I could be steering…lol
and that ice situation, ladies and gentleman, is why you don't leave your hitch in when you aren't towing.
Reminds me of that Steve Martin skit from a long time ago... When he took his steamroller out lol
$8,000 dollars of nothing but troubles. Live and learn 😂,  Andrew Camarata
Should have bought all drive unit especially for steep roads ways. This will give you nightmares.  Running a Roller can be very dangerous,  you will see.
You gonna have one of everything someday. I would LOVE to be doing it too...
A good strap is stringer than a chain.  Chains have a weak point at the welds.
Who needs OSHA when you got Andrew.
Gøy med ny leker 🌞👍
I like how Andrew showed his inner whistlin diesel for once 😂
The title should be how to get somebody killed with junk construction equipment.
I miss you and Sam doing stuff together.  I hope someday,  you'll be friends.
Time to do some sketchy shit do daa do daaa
minute 36.24 of the video, wooww
What does a roller this size weigh, 20,000 lbs?
thats my push mower :(
The eternal problem with technology, someone from the team has bad karma...
When are you gonna do a live video of your new truck bumper
You added the new bumper onto your Dodge ram
that's  so cool
Damn, someone could have benefited from that push mower.
I would say Andrew is a complete air-head !  Why?  Anyone risking other's lives for the "fun" of it really can't be all there.  Too much of a macho man in order to do it right and have a wrecking crew that would come out and drag the roller out in no time.  I guess Andrew just wants to always prove himself?
the roller with bald tires going up the hill lol
I remember a while back a few years you were working on saws and mowers and skidoos? Now look at what your doing! Moving on up to bigger and better machines LOL!
Awesome video Andrew, a new tool
Should drop one of those in your rock crusher. 😊
That tracked grader machine could have been cool for something like shaping the slopes on ponds etc....
Always comical watching you wreck stuff
Boys and their toys.
Stopped watching when the mower was run over.  Pointless.
I hate when I comment before watching whole video. Hes pure entertainment
I love and hate how the dogs are smarter than my kids. He never has to yell "get the hell out of the way."
Great video as always, but i was very sad when i see you destroyed that tractor lawn mower, because i need one :(
Why’d they take off the chupa?
God i love this guy. He buys a roller and immediately starts running over and flattening lawns mowers and stuff. Like a big kid at heart. Keep it up!!
It’s not delivery it’s Digiorno
Yeah, fuck pressed metal machines
👍👍👍!!!
Comedy of errors. Over and under on serious bodily harm?
shoulda, woulda, coulda
'Will the mower run?'
Rock&Roll
For a very intelligent guy, that was a very stupid way of trying to get the roller out ! Ice, winch from small tree,ice, too small of chain. Did I mention ice. All that risk , for a non important job.😢
I'm glad I don't live downhill from Andrew.
It's  not  good  , put your shirt  men
Damn, this is entertaining stuff. Andrew, you are a man of action and I like it. Sure there may be some uh-oh moments, but you deal with them as they arise. Is that a liquid filled drum? Does it have liquid in it? If so, pump it into barrels and refill when you get to the top of mountain.
I guess if Americans are going to put men on Mars,Andrew will not be on the team
almost dies....."I don't like this" bahahahaha OMG this is the most chill guy i've ever had the pleasure of watching.
I think old push mowers will fill potholes now
Fixed up dump truck, new trailer and clean looking "new" roller... makes for  a satisfying picture Andrew.
I enjoy your videos, but the dogs running around while you guys work gives me anxiety. I watched a nice lady at a church function let her labs out to run next to her truck just like she’d done a thousand times. The black one rounded the front of her slow moving truck and slipped on ice. It was horrible to see. worse to hear. God bless. Keep the videos coming.
47:35 WOW
Yer going to have a hell of a time starting that mower come spring ya know.
Has it 5 minutes and puts it to work. Then almost loses it down the side of the mountain !!!
Same color as Vodka.😮
Brother. Im not criticizing and I'm not your father. But your jumping off that roller while its in reverse, rolling down that trailer is tempting fate. Then you did it again by climbing back on.. Yes, you can probably get away with it many more times- until the one time you dont. Catch a pant leg, trip on the trailer or get stuck and it will be a slow motion painful ending. Happens hundreds of times a year to people who never thought it was an issue.. Views aren't worth it.
Is Andrews lady friend (?) still around, I don't think I've seen her for a while. Shame if she has gone as she was a Kindred spirit for Andrew
UFR, Andrew are you trying to kill your buddy's, and your self? Sketchy!
First mulching mowers to now flattening them 🙀🔥🥳
almost took out the whole crew to make gravel for youtube
Andrew, I don't see the point of crushing items, we all know what that machine is capable of so what's the point. I would be more interested in you repairing the brake system.
Was most liked before Messi&#39;s invasion 落
When the grease is released to put new tracks on, does the old grease just stay in the housing or where does it go? Seems so weird to me.
Labas 🤗🇱🇹
Some Midday Distruction! And that’s quite all right!
That is a deal. Proud to see the new Vids. You do a fine job Sir.
Please buy a shredder to destroy  something!!!!
First thing you should've done was roll over protection , and fancy risking driving it up hill bald tires on ice ,Just remember you all only got one Life and you are a long time DEAD no coming back from that
Ывхмапыхвыпхвысххвыпвысхвыхывхпыпыывмыыхввсхвсвысхы
So Andrew’s plans to open a towing and recovery business are in doubt.  I was hoping they would try a couple more times so I could see both pieces of equipment 150’ off the road on their side.    Much heavier chain, larger diameter pulley, heavy cable to secure pulling vehicle and think much more about where your attaching the pulley and cable and the geometry of it.  Stop at any church you pass on the way home and pray nobody got hurt.  No safety equipment and no one in charge of keeping people out of the bite of the cable and chains
O no !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool to see that old Ford still kickin’ ass. Love your videos!
What a novel idea.  Filling potholes with old lawn mowers.
A "Sheep's Foot" roller head would help you a lot on settling and cracking that slate rock. Well... after watching the vid... maybe it's best as it is with s flat roller. Seems like it's breaking the rock a bit.
lmao. "Buying a roller" is literally the most underated title Ive ever seen, holy crap! You could have seriously hurt yourself or even died when that thing dragged you :o
Is that Samantha on that mover,!? is she back 😄Great if so, maybe a guest apperance,..Great anyways. Cheers💚
Andrew, wouldn’t you want to flush those gearboxes? Or is changing the oil ‘good enough’?
Now how that guy was able to keep that roller on the road for that long with  that speed amazes me
I have come to realize Andrew really hates mowers.
35:57 man everything just started to down hill (pun intended)
Should’ve bought the gradall, I only say that bc I work on them haha
Hands-free driving please
It definitely wanted to be free and live in the woods with its own kind.
Are you printing money?? Bee honest.🤨
Use a park brake you M**** OMG what a bunch of M****ns
36:25 that "okay" lol
Definitely need roll over protection on the roller. I have seen several roll over.
Next week's video, fixing a lawnmower that's been run over with a roller. Using only a chainsaw and cutting torch
Next time this happens, and someone I know there will be a next time, put the pulley on a stout tree ABOVE the stuck implement and drive the skidder downhill. Then your weight will be working with you, not against your and you can control both forward and reverse with the vehicle as much as the winch controls.  Also, stop and take a second and tie it off to captor progress. You started with a bad situation and progressively made it worse by trying to just yank on it.
Its only a matter of time before this idiot kills himself or one of his buddies. Absolutely no planning, no regard for loading on those chains, he just dogs his machinery until something breaks. It would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous. Like tying a 20 ton roller to a fucking twig haha. When he finally got the roller moving in the right direction he was far too close to the edge to be able to pull the roller onto the road. What does he do... keep hauling until the chain breaks. Its beyond me why on earth he didn't just tie the winch machine to a strong tree with proper sturdy chains at the start, when he was being dragged towards the roller.  Really love his content but when he finally kills himself or someone else that'll be the end of him.
“Based off of that we are realizing this isn’t very much fun anymore” 😂
Lol I could have used that deck on that Murray lawn tractor. That was awesome to see!
I think all the push mower needs is a carburetor kit!  💪👍🏼
You could have just used the push mower to fill the pot hole!
leave it to Camarata to only attempt to get this roller up the mountain in cold, snowy, muddy weather!!! HA!
WHISLINDIESEL?
I have been watching your videos forever, and I seem to remember that years ago you would create content of jobs that you performed for customers. I haven't seen any in quite some time. Do you ever think of doing those again?
The amount of machinery that has gotten stuck on this mountain...
some one neefs to get him a camera mount for the outside of that truck
Great video.  I'd worm the 🐕
I've owned all the work trucks, Chevy Ford, but by far, the best work truck is Dodge and underrated at that... love Dodge trucks
Grab a bigger chain, and fire up the D-7...
You should turn the fuel up on that dump truck….
The roller drum is hollow so it can be filled with water to give it weight for work, and drain it for easier transport of the machine. You forgot to fill it, you operate an empty drum
Greetings from New Zealand..... just a thought..... modern art.....I think there's a market for flat lawnmower wall hangings......step 1, flatten mower ....step 2 , secure any loose parts with a good glue......step 3, write a descriptive explanation of how you feel about this peice..... step 4, decide on a suitably eye watering price...... step 4, find the biggest flashest art gallery and hang it on their wall........ Good luck !!!......and go safe 😎
This is the most sketchy thing I have seen you do yet!
Anybody else see big foot watching from down in the woods at the 47:45 marker? It's when Andrew said " at least it still right side up".
Andrew's Channel is always good for a laugh at Andrew's expense, unfortunately. LOL😂
Mustie1 would be shaking his head seeing those mowers crushed :-)
44:32 I just busted out laughing. This recovery was "sketchy" comedy, so on brand....🤣🤣
I don’t think a roller is meant to run over garden tractors all you’re doing is destroying the equipment...
I like the small detail of mentioning how much it costs, I was watching older videos and noticed you always mentioned it before. I think It gives a reference point for someone who might  wanna do what you do
Man the moment Andrew says he doesnt like it at all and stops the recovery .... We all know he is not joking. I saw the previous one already and  the roller mad it. Really challeging conditions to get your heavy equipment to the top.
I would turn riding mower over to mustie1 and se if he can fix it. 🙂
Is this roller cylinder filled with water for weight?
Boa tarde Andrew  muito ótimo  esse trabalho máquina meu amigo
How many times have we ever said " I knew I should have"?  I had a dollar for every time I said that...
It's all fun and games until someone loses an arm or is killed. Many farmers and others are killed by tractor roll overs. Keep on playing.
Camarata, you idiot!You're also setting an example for other idiots!
As hard as he works I’d like to see him get Atleast one skid steer with heat and ac lol
Never seen anyone tear so much shit up.
18:43 I’m sure I’m not the first to comment, Andrew you need to get a double flare tool. Only double flares on brake lines.
Just saying .. that roller recovery was a shit show .. f*cking useless .. I expect more of you Andrew :(
My only suggestion would to put a blanket on that cable.
Andrew loves to take equipment up that road in the worst time of the year. It makes for great content.
Wouldn't chaining the roller tires and backing up the hills work?
Hi Andrew, do you ever SELL anything.?
Mower pancakes.  Obviously the first priority!  Another classic.  On to the next video.  Thanks Andrew, glad to see you guys all made it out in one piece.
12:18 please do that and make a video.
Just buy a crusher
How much of your life thus far has been spent battling this mountain you bought? lol..Would it have made better sense to spend a lil more for better ground?
. . . total respect for this sensual man
Wow, who's the manufacturer and model of those battery connector spreaders? Very nice. Thanks for posting!
Sorry for your accident. I'm glad everyone is OK.  It's going to make for a great video!
"Oh, that's worse"
That ending was very entertaining. Frustrating for you I’m sure but thanks for giving us enjoyment.
Lol this has 20 mil now
I'm 56 years old and that is the first set of battery terminal spreader pliers I've ever seen !  That was worth the price of admission !
Should have called in Post 10 for that culvert unclogging.
Ghost Rider !!!!!!!!!!!!!... lol
Might have to put a tire on her.😂
If you slow down it will pack better
Wi-Fi steering lol
I thought you were going to be like that guy on Austin powers! lol
That was fun!
This was that best video yet, but please be careful brother ! We don’t want anything happening to you!
Good stuff AC.. Have you looked into printers and decal cutting machines yet?
I like when Andrew is putting the new track on the skid steer the other dude is standing in the background just chillin 😄
Wow! what an action! this episode is called "rescue hippo from the swamp"👍
Breakin’ stuff reminds me of Andrews early videos👍
Prime example towards the end , if not to put off a move that should have been done in warmer weather, and not wait to the last min, i am shocked no one was hurt, but we watch this little feeler and made him a multi millionaire,  lol
Andrew is the definition of “this is why we can’t have nice things”😂😂😂. My man did with that roller what all of us would have wanted to do lol
dude i wana do a concrete colab w u! i only have 11k but we are def the same type of people. im from indiana and hire homeless guys and x addicts to help and get them on their feet
Jumping on and off moving equipment. Ask Jeremy Renner how smart that is.
🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
Death of the lawnmower, the movie!
They are going to title your autobiography "Shaking Hands with Danger; The Andrew Camarata story"
Mower ran when last parked, make me an offer I know what I got here. My loss your gain
You could just fill in the pot holes with old mowers
You should have had more brains than to tow it up the hill with a pissy little ute,  use the D4 at least.
You might want to finally invest in some pipe bumpers for your truck. They'll hold up better than the tin foil OE stuff.   Also, look into Skookum logging pulleys. Much better quality & higher load capacity than the cheap ones that you're picking up locally. They're designed to take the abuse.  Keep up the great videos!
Ok!   I think you killed the mowers already!   I think Andrew is going buy a huge car crusher squishing machine and go into the metal recovery business!   That mountaintop dirt road is beyond sketchy!   But you guys are creative on solving the extraction/recovery process.  You just need several, bigger, and stronger both trees and chains.   I have full confidence you'll get it out without hurting anyone or any equipment.
Time to call Heavy D
Crushing mowers with a roller is not what you’re supposed to use them for but definitely the content I’m here for 😂😂
Another cool video can’t wait to see part two about the role of coming out of the hill
New tires?
Ma perché 😡😡😡😡
"Alright, thats how that looks" 🤣🤣
Andrew hope your using Copper Nickel for Brake Line and not Copper.
Just leave it there for somebody to come along in 35 years and make a video “lost in the woods will it run” 😊
Leave the mowers at the end of your drive, Matt @dieselcreek will pick them up and get them running. 🤣
Cuidado com as armadilha do demônio  Destruir as coisas por prazer  é uma delas  Ele gosta muito de iludir pessoas trabalhadora dedicada e esforcada como a sua pessoa  Muia fé 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👊👍
Because your other one didn't quite manage to kill you? ;) [Edited to add] Oh, I see. This _was_ the one.
where is Caption  why not every day put on the CC please thanks
my favorite is FORKLIFT !!!
See now that's like that... 😆
What kind of boots you rockin right now brotha?
These videos make me wanna do stuff
The black truck was interesting. I've seen them like that but always for cargo containers, open top dumpsters or large tanks.  Never seen one used with a flat bed to haul equipment around.
Wakey Bakey If Andrew Jackson gets rolled over like a 20 dollar bill😁
Wow, that was painful to watch
You should have pulled it by the tire side only to begin with
Look up diesel Creek he has dealt with Galion
10:00 They brought his little dog bed out!
Ask Jeramy Renner!
This reminds me of Hal from Malcom in the middle winning the lottery and not telling his family.  He rented a roller and a parking lot and spent the day crushing things.
ROADA ROLLA DA!!!
Andrew  There should be a vent on top of the axle.  If it is damaged or knocked off water can get in the  differential gearbox.  I've seen this happen.
I think that was a bad day to try to move the roller up the hill. Maybe just my thought though
Well, THAT did not go as planned.  :D Andrew is so non plussed...just casually says "I don't like this."  after he almost gets pulled down the hill by the roller.  Ford slides backwards into the Dodge : > D
I thought Andrew had been watching whistlen Diesel
I would have filled those with ATF or diesel and run it around the yard a bit and then put in the good stuff.
“Alright we’ll that’s how that looks” - Andrew 😂
What a great video, verrry interesting…
I was right you're are dicks -🤣🤣👍
I’ve never seen that much water come out of an engine and still be good
Wouldn’t be an Andrew Camarata video without a lawnmower being crushed
that can be one way to fix a shop lifter  =O
Do a car
Now you can store all your scrap in 1 place and take it in once or twice a year. Feel better
Hammer time!
"...and ask them if they can fix it" lol
Should have took the big dozer to get it.
Built a few of those Galion rollers Graders and cranes
New T-Shirt on the Camarata Store: "At least it's still right side up"           /\ 🚜 /\
What auction site do you use for heavy machinery??
Honestly, how many times did you shit your pants doing this hahaha, stay safe dude :D
You are so lucky to still be alive, I wish you the best of luck getting it out of that spot, but you wanna take this puzzle a lot more seriously than you did, I don't think your next video should be this is how he died and I have the greatest admiration for you and all the years of wonderful videos but this shit is serious shit. You never tie off to anything that is not 5 times the load your trying to recover as well the steepness of the hill your trying to recover over also has to be factored in, you cannot have cables taking impacts like your skidder is because its now compromised. Having said that its a better day that your cable breaks and you lose the roller uncontrolled down that mountain because as you almost found out being dragged backward off that road is something you are not likely to survive, even if you have a seat belt and you don't get dragged out then you're likely to get something come through the cabin. I wish you the best of luck with this puzzle, but your gear is way to small like your snatch block pullies and the chains your using for those loads, you would do much better to anchor the front of the Skidder to something that won't allow you to be pulled off the road but again it must be so big and its chain so strong that nothing can break or none of the tie off points can be torn out because those failures will also get you or someone else killed. Its not often we see the real fear in Andrews eyes but its real when you bearly stopped going backwards off the cliff. Cheers Brother, stay safe
Its like  a scene in the movie " Die Hard" except this happened in real time 🤣🤣
Have you ever cross threaded something by starting it with the impact?
You should have called @Mattsoffroadrecovery
Ahhhh...they just don't make lawn mowers like back in the old days...
This part of pizza at 21:06 waited for me !!!! Thanks Andrew !!!!
is this a mf jojo's reference
👍🙏👍
Seems like you’ve got yourself in a little bit of a pickle🇬🇧
"i guess i could be steering it"
Awesome video Andrew.
Andrews obsession with turning big rocks into small rocks has been an interesting journey.  😄
Andrew, you should have titled this fixing pot holes with push mowers
"At least it's still right side up" - the consistently positive attitude in the face of adversity is always an inspiration!
In the skidder there is a rear blade that avoid that the machine will back, and they didn't use. Secondly when the wheight is a high and hard or slippery terrain, it's better to go forward without nothing pull and after some meters put down the rear blade and pull the loads just with the winches.  They seriously risked injuries to recover an heavy machine like that. During the recover an heavy machine it's necessary to act as an elevator as a 	counterweight when is possible so the recovery machine have to get in opposite direction of the slope and the main recover rope have to use an anchoring like a big stable rock or big tree, or more trees and better to use pulley with double or more sheaves to lighten the loads so if the machine recovered go down the other don't follow that in the same direction but as long as the recovery rope is attached, in case of problems, if the Heavy machine go down, the other recover machine will not follow that because have to climb the slope and his weight will help for the stablity and during recover.  Sorry for my english, but anyway here is the scheme                                                       O   ->  Anchor Point                                                 /        \                                              /               \                                           _                     \                                        /_/                          \           Recovery Machine                             \ In opposite direction to the slope.               \                                                                               \                                                                                 |                                                                                 |                                                                               ⌗                                                                        Heavy Load
Well that sucks.   Buy, fix, stuck.
16:37 "It looked like an ignorable fire" Andrew Camarata
Wowza man that's was a white knuckle ride for sure
Safety first = less people falling down and less time and money repairing equipment. A few lessons in the laws of physics and basic civil engineering might help as well.
Lol "at least its still upright"🙃
Hey bud I get it man I wouldn't want a pinch point be coming from me either scrapper
"Atleast it's still right side up" he says as his new roller sides down a hill. Never change Andrew haha
Should have been us[ng your huge bulldozer for a sure pull but these trials do make a more entertaining video. Love every minute of it.
Thanks for filming
I think if u had gone one step further and pressed the track adjuster in all the way it would have been an even quicker track change. Thanks for posting
try down hill
I wonder how it is possible that you are still alive man :D God bless you brother
i honestly woulkd of fired the compactor up and have it help its self out
My wife asked me what I wanted for my birthday and I told her I want to spend a weekend with Andrew doing bulldozer stuff.  I got some socks instead.  I know you’re probably pulling down some decent scratch but a heavy equipment camp for boring dads could create some serious revenue.  Call it Camp Camarata.  I’d pay 5k to bust rocks and ride ATVs.
YESSSSSSS VIOLENT LAWNMOWER CRUSHING SESSION FTW
My guy, this is next level ASMR. I love your videos man!
So stupid
🤣😂
The law mower crushing part is boring ...
Broke Everything Mountain! Glad no one was hurt.
I really can’t believe how fuckin stupid you really are
ON DAVES VIDEO I SAW THAT YOU ARE GETTING NEW TIRES. I KNOW CHAINS THAT YOU HAVE ON THE SKIDDER ARE EXPENSIVE BUT A SET OF THOSE TYPE CHAINS ON THE ROLLER MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO HELP THAT ROLLER TO GET AROUND BETTER AND THE CHSINS WOULD ALSO HELP BREAK UP THE ROCKS. mIGHT BE WORTH A TRU INSTEAD OF GETTING ANOTHER ONE WITH A DRIVE ROLLER.
Tell us when you sell equipment too..........
Was there a lot of movement in the joint where it pivots in the middle when you unloaded it off the trailer it looks like it moves a lot
So sketchy lol
You paid 8 grand for that P o s
Well, at least it's still upright.
40:19 even Kody knows something aint right.  As always great video Andrew!
By the time Andrew is finished, he can start his own road building company with all the latest toys he purchased!
every now and then you find some good stuff on the trending page
36:22 that was the most nonchalant "Oh that's way worse" I've ever heard while watching an $8k piece of equipment almost roll down a mountain. Oh right I'm watching Camarata.
The engine on that mower was a Briggs & Flatten
I think it's very nice that Andrew has his little brother to assist him in various endeavors.
Did you sell the 10 wheeler international?
That was the "okay" of someone who knows how much worse it could have been. (36:25)
“Alright.  That’s how that looks.” LMAO!
Sooperskketch
I've never seen anything like this before.
I feel its only a matter of time before he tries to pave a road with lawn mowers instead of rock
10:10 AC may be 37 but he still has the teenage impulses..
Wow Drew an friends you al were not expecting the ice being a factor of the Trucks not being able to help the vibration crusher all the way up the mountain with out any mishaps you guys were very blessed to come out unscathed the skidded is a serious grown man but needed some stronger trees an chains that was another great idea to put skidded behind a tree but I didn’t see a tree strong enough to keep the skidder in place should have chained skidder to a tree at the push blade but later on in the next video I see the Lord placed that thought in your ideas of how to get it the vibrator back on the road way , we’re was the big dozer would have worked perfectly together on that recovery job anyway glad everyone is ok take care.
Get rid of that roller. It is not going to do anything you want and  is dangerous and not suited to your terrain. Take the skidder back, no sense in abusing it. Recovery is more of a job for a D7E and winch.
He was telling you.  You should of bought this one.
Mustie1 could revive it!!!!!!
Lawn Mower decals, made while you wait.
Brakes are over rated. Always wanted to roll my yard with one.
Herrlich, Danke.
Why remove the seat protection (from the elements) is beyond me.  Need bigger chains.  Need bigger trees.  Need multi part pulleys. How did the water get into the gear box? Ron W4BIN
Super sketchy
That mountain road is going to be so smooth.
Looks like a busy road building this spring and summer
A roller with angle irons welded on would break up road ice
Because no one else said it...  @10:24 ...that's what she said last night.
Is there nothing you can’t do. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Can you add water to the front drum of the roller? Is obviously a vibratory roller.
"that's how that looks" 😂😂
30:15 - needed a POST10 cameo :)
Does this mean you aren't going to fix that mower I sent?   Hard to fix it when it is now 2D.
👍
Move up the skidder chain the skidder to a solid tree run cable through one or two snatch blocks doubling your power that machine and skidder should be as far away from each other as possible so you are using the entirety of your cable and any time you needed to re rig or Change positing or anything where it involves letting go of the roller it needed to be achored before release I work in the woods for 20 years and I've worked a few towing companies too that skidder will get it but your just going about things wrong regroup and come back with more tools chains snatch blocks and things to put under the tires of both machines
Bunch of boys playin' with toys. Doesn't make much sense climbing of hill of with a roller compacting large rocks?? Good way of screwing up the vibratory wheel. $$$$$
I remember when Andrew used to fix lawn mowers, and crush cars.
May be a stoopid question but can the roller be filled with water 💧
Holy smokes  that's  for real glad you guys are safe .  Thank you for bringing us along
I guess those were the "problem mowers" of the fleet. That's definitely one way to deal with idle surge, I suppose!
At 7:05;  Is that what I think it is, a metal battery hold down? If it is, how is it Not grounding out?
Haven't seen the next video yet but I'm thinking Ron Pratt would be useful. 🤔👍 Next video in 3, 2, 1.
What the heck did that lawnmower do to deserve such a fate?  I would have stopped once flattened, and hung on wall, as a warning for any stubborn equipment!
🤍🤎🧡
Camarata tree service
It's CCCCCCarl come to KKKKKKKKilll me
i've changed thousands of diff's oil and never seen it that bad.
4:41 I could feel my laptop shaking
@46:13 :D liked that line.
That will come in very Handy Andrew 👍🏻
“At least it’s still right side up.”  Made for good entertainment but can’t help wondering if up a mountain isn’t really the best place for a roller.
icebug boots from Sweden for personal traction
Damn not only did the roller go into the ditch the trucks hit each other too
44:34 that moment after that you should let it be… go home and try it next day. Right decision 👍
What??  The mower...are you like 12 years old or something??
How is it so hot where you are?
Buying "stump remover"
A new pull start handle and it will still cut like a dream lol
Lol
Dayum, you got a much better deal than Diesel Creek!
How many lawnmowers would you need to make the whole driveway lawnmowers?
Andrew if I was you I would change those back tiers it looks like no enough traction on it.
41:43 😅
This video was freaking fantastic. From crushing mowers to several people almost dying multiple times. Awesome 😂
Hey Andrew, just want to say its great that your friends are in the videos. You are a BEAST but having friends help out with projects always makes it worth it.
Just a tip Andrew. Never vibrate the drum when the machine is stationary. It hammers the bearings in the vibrator housings on one area. I worked for Galion many years ago. All the best.
Admittedly one of the more creative ways I've seen Andrew remove undesirable trees
Well one down and one to go. What fun , had nothing else to do anyway.
Daaamn it, Andrew! I thought You're a smart guy 🙂
Andrew now that's not what the roller is for but I  Can see ur all kid at heart. Love watching ur videos.
No idea why those dudes were laughing.  Nothing funny about that. Holy Crap!   Friction... Too much, not good.  Not enough, not good.
20:02 I like how Andrew doesn’t treat people like shit. He just says ok that’s how that looks. But we all know his better than new standards.
44:41 I may have pooped a little. I doubt I was the only one.
Running over lawnmowers is stupid.
Andrew Camarata has help fixing equipment? A totally new concept for this channel. (Almost)
I'm sure many have mentioned it and not something overlooked by y'all, but standing behind that with that wire under tension seemed supremely dangerous. Glad you're ok, what an adventure! Best
🤠
That mower is gonna need a new carb if he ever hopes to get it cranked.
Как ты живешь без мозгов???Ты думаешь прежде чем что то сделать??
Just build another road under the roller.
This a new f Roller I seen  one he did  before
Something about Mack Trucks that just look fucking bad ass.
i think we got a new saying flat as a lawnmower crushed by andrew
hello !!! good video! sei proprio un casinaro pero'
жаль технику
At 7:46 Cody sits in the water he drank out of.Typical Lab. Brings back memories of my labs. Loved it.
Tread on those who tread on you
Que mala pata como se ha caído la máquina por el barranco💪💪💪💪💪😭😭
Andrew, ya got a monster dozer. Use the dozer uphill of the skidder both pulling it.  Skim off the ice first.
I wouldn't try and winch as close as you are.  Try and winch further away to create more leverage.  Just stand clear of the cable The lower the center of gravity is always better for control
Странно, что не предусмотрен залив и слив воды в тело груза-барабана.
Interesting situation ?. David UK.
The amount of dumb sht you get away with is mind boggling.
OSHA Approved :)
Bad idea to single flare brake lines.
🤔 yep. Roller much heavier than the skid. Lucky roller didn't take ya for an adventurous down hill ride.
為了什麽？！又證明了什麽？！
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Nothing better than doing stupid shit in the woods with your friends!
This is the best entertainment ever
35:45 Onwards... Idiocy at it finest.
he almost died there lol
Why you hete landmovers so much? O.o
turn on the caption.. omg.. 😪
I bet someone chit in their pants at 44:39.
Couldn't ask for a more perfect, icy, snowy, cold day, to move heavy equipment.....SMH🤦‍♂
Yes Andrew this time you did scare me!!! Could have turned out way worse.
Got all the equipment make a damn roadway already I would of the first accident nevermind like the 10th lol your friend almost got crushes and killed your road is lower than all the rest so water just gonna follow it like a stream and freeze up
Now watching that lawn mower get flattened out was fun stuff, thanks.
The drums on rollers are full of oil aswell might want to check that front drum out
Nothings ever easy huh. But at least it made a funny video.
Bruh
Looks like a rescue job for HeavyDSparks.  It's a little far from  Utah though.
Pull down the road.....
I thought you were draining the engine oil when it was water!! I was thinking welp now it needs a motor too. Glad it was not in the motor!
Go down hill
You should be going down hill🍀
Another good video 👍👍
Dude has a graveyard tan! lol
one step closer to a 4 lane paved highway leading to the conex box castle!!
Slicks and a smooth steel drum in Winter.....  :(
Problems with stuck gear? Not really, next Camarata depot isn’t far away…
Time to bring in the dozer.
I hope your insurance agent isn't a subscriber!
That's a strange battery hold down plate- steel just under the positive terminal on a machine that vibrates .
2:32 "I guess I could be steering it" as the several ton vehicle slowly rolls off the back while hes holding a camera. That's just great! I needed a good laugh after a crappy day yesterday. Thank you for that :)
cool
What a f****** fiasco
Andrew probably has one of the only houses in which it's possible to have "an ignorable fire" 😂
41:43 undying optimism
The best part about this channel is the showcase of how TERRIBLE people are at maintaining old equipment. Good thing our boy Andrew picks up these old rigs and gives them some love.
you make WhistinDiesel look like a 4th grader . . must be that crazy Italian blood.
that was great. nice to see jen in a good l mood.
Das kann nur besser werden, es ist ärgerlich, wenn es passiert, du solltest wirklich etwas  in den Straßenausbau machen, oder ein kräftiger Hubschrauber oder eine Lastenseilbahn, das Wetter wird besser und du kannst wenigstens einige Tage mit Ruhe verbringen, du wirst sehen es wird besser!
?????????? And that would be why
Perché i sottotitoli non sono quasi mai disponibili ???
what are you guys doing. looks like a mess. why are you not using a dozer to pull it out of there that skid loader just ain't working.
make a new road down the mountain with the roller, problem solved
Another good way to repair potholes….throw push mower in it.
I think you have way to much money ...
30:13 Post10 just creamed his pants at that
Fark!
Oops... At least the side of the hill will be nicely compacted...
Andrew’s next video. Buying a 100 ton winch
Andrew you r sad lol
Your clips always have so much more than the title.  Was on the edge of my seat 👏
Is that a boy or a girl working with you..
Where's the cabover for the roller, you could have killed the driver trying to get up that icy road to your camp.
I never like rollers. The rocks you crushed took multiple passes. You could have done it manually In about 30 seconds.
Starving kids could've eaten that mower!  Lol
I hope your friend compensated you for the body damage to the front of your truck. 😂.  Nice to have a true work truck where you don’t have to worry about putting a dent in it.
You are going to end up like Jeremy Renner if you don’t stop playing around with all of those broken machines on ice.
I think that Andrew could repair the crack of dawn if he had to. It is such a plus that he can fix all of these monsters without having to outsource the repairs. The costs would be astronomical, I would imagine.
Should've saved them mower wheels. For another project
Great video but I’d take a look at the intercooler on your truck after taking that pintle to the bumper, the common rail intercoolers go down to the bottom of the frame rails and if damaged you’ll notice a significant loss of power…. Ask me how I know 😂
Running over lawn mowers is a plus. Gives you some more room on the trailer when you do a scrap run.
The pucker factor at the end is off the charts.
Cody recons start building  new road below the roller and drive it out, she doesnt want to come up to the old road !!
My Father was fined £5.00 in 1947, after brake failure on a road roller at the top of a long hill in town Court had reduced the fine due to riding on it and sounding the horn untill it crashed.
I want a roller..
I bet Sam has a lot of fun on the equipment.
Towards the end of the video yer 2 dogs showed they are very alert to strange creaking chain sounds.
Andy is kind of hard on the merchandise
Andrew sure knows how to have a fun day!
Sketch!  Been a minute since Ive seen someone jump off a piece of equipment like that
LOL...attempt to recover roller with "mickey mouse" chains and snatch blocks, looking like a bunch of clowns trying to f*** a football. Get some 1/2" grade 100 chains and some 20 ton Crosby/McKissick snatch blocks and your recovery might be accomplished assuming 'clowns' know how to rig everything!  Don't flirt with death, you will lose!
As soon as he said look how flat that is after running over the lawn mower I said to myself I wonder what he’s gonna smash next….here comes the ride on. Hahahaha
Andrew, you need to stop, think and then act. Also be careful with your dogs, here in my town, being around heavy machinery they get crushed all the time.
Sweet tricycle man, don't tip it!
Haha wow. What a shit show! Love it
Looks like it might be time to give ol' Heavy D a call! lol
Try using a calculator. Every piece of equipment has a weight label, and every chain comes with a breaking point. Now take the weight of what you're pulling plus add the force needed, and add that into the calculator. Now purchase a chain or cable that can withstand that weight and forces. It's not rocket science. You will either kill someone or yourself. I can guarantee you that you soiled yourself when that roller tossed you and the skidder around like you were a Tonka toy. You tried to look "cool" but I know your underwear needed to be changed. There are times to be a cowboy and there are times to be an adult.
I am just surprised you couldn’t get a roller up a mountain behind a small truck on a frozen dirt road. 🤷‍♂️
When I saw this one machine that you bought I was just thinking about you rolling over something never thought you would be rolling on a lawnmower bahahaha I love all your videos wish I could be working for you you seem like the best boss and I know that I can learn from a master like you.
if i was closer i got two rideon mowers id love to fix with this thing lolllll
🤣🤣🤣
Me and my family log for a living here,  in NW Montana.  We own 48,    Western Star 4900 X SERIES. With 600 HP And 2050 in TORQUE. This is the most  heavy duty models made and then we converted 27 of them over to front axle 4x4. I could keep going and going and tooting my own horn about our Company and the several millions of dollars worth of equipment we own…. But,  that would be a complete waste of time.  The point I’m getting at is when I talk I talk from experience concerning things that I know about. Just like log skidders,  I know a little bit about them.   Whoever sold this piece of junk to Andy ripped him off big time. They also know that the chains that are on that skitter are not worth nothing they’re nothing but old worn out trash and I have sent  him on 3 different occasions the kind of chains that he needs for muddy conditions, and the same ones that we buy.  By the crate-full.   But I guess Andy  doesn’t listen. I like this guy a lot, but he has a propensity not to listen to anybody and to him every piece of equipment is not worth nothing unless it can handle all the abuse that he puts out. And then when it cannot,   , it’s all about how bad it was engineered.      Just like this road he was on he doesn’t really know a whole lot because common sense would’ve told him not to start up that road the way that his equipment was not dressed out to handle it.  PROPERLY.  I could’ve told you everything that happened Could have happened but he wouldn’t listen to nobody, and the person that was steering the roller could have gotten killed!!    HE COULD HAVE GOTTEN CRUSHED!!!!    You always plan from a safety perspective on things that can happen. But he never plans anything from a safety perspective.
i mean after doing that skidsteer track did you ever consider like, adding grease and actually tensioning it correctly?
Hay get a new seat in that truck there is absolutely no reason to ever have a seat like than and still spending money on other stuff
brilliant, never laughed so much, keep it up.
Might just have to drive the roller out, find the level match to the road and make a path.
I thought of 2 way more successful recoveries.  The first being that you could have backed up to the roller and winched some weight onto the rear tires which would have helped it bite more traction.   2. Being that someone should have powered that roller so it wasn't dead weight?
Use the Green Cat. You can tie that thing off to the mountain and alter the rotation of the Earth 👌🏼
Lawn mower for sale,,, lightly used,,, compression problem... lollolololol
lol
Think I would have used the dozer. A guy got killed near where I live doing a similar job. Stay safe, take your time. That skidder could have been dragged over the edge. Dodged a bullet there.
ありがとうございます！
I actually posted a couple comments earlier but after what happened at @39:46 In...I just deleted them and am settling on this one: With all due respect to Andrew and his crew in New York.....after watching this I'm real sure that if anyone from NY ever feels like calling anyone from West Virginia a "Hoopty Hillbilly"......they'd best make sure that West Virginia hillbilly isn't aware of this footage.  All dental work related issues aside.
Andy, the dog you call Buddy,   I guarantee you this about him.  He has worms.  Look at his sides.  His ribs are showing easily.   By Far.    All dogs that spend the vast majority of there time out-doors,   Need to be “wormed”.     Once a year.  I de-worm our 2 Rottweilers twice a year.    And they don’t spend near the amount of time outdoors like your dogs do. Suffice to say your dogs all but live outside.   And it might surprise you to know exactly what they eat and swallow during the day if you could actually follow them around and any vet tell you this.      Furthermore, any vet will ask you when is the last time you dewormed your dogs.  If you say never, he’s going to give them a pill that looks like the size of a horse and the next time your dogs go to poop,  every bit of their poop is gonna be full of worms.    And,    it will be for sometime,every time they take a dump and you’re going to see just how much weight they put on.  Both of them will fill out and,    their coat will  look so good 😊 so shiny!!
👌🤓
Effing Clown!
What is an Andy Camarata video without him,   Destroying something that belongs to him.  Lol 😆
Flat pack lawnmower 😆
titl?
It seems like the Skidder is the most useful wrecker of choice . Always a pleasure . Andrew has the tenacity unlike any normal human being .
there’s a new project farm lawnmower test subject
Awesome .... Cody and Blue know more about recovery than most companies.
Just  like a bid kid with a new Toy⚠ LOL
We’ll It’s about time that you came out with another video Andy!!!    It’s been 2 long long,   WEEKS!!
Glad to see Andrews lady friend back, adds a touch of sweetness to the show.
Where else on YouTube would you get content like Andrew's
Where’s the big dozer?
very cool, enjoyed it   Jim
I think now we can establish a rule that if Andrew asks you to drive something for him, something sketchy is going to happen and the wise move would be to refrain from accepting..
Watching this and thinking, “That’s how they roll.”
The definition of “deferred maintenance”
Those gear boxes and differential need to be completely flushed.
Was I the only one singing, "Time to do some sketchy shit, do dah do dah. Hope I get a way with it?"
A request - if it’s not too much of a PIA, when using some of those funky 1-off tools, like the brake line forming tools, maybe y’all could provide a bit of context - what’s the tool, material, etc?
Wow!  Talk about a cliff hanger!
Andrew needs to see if someone can make a heavy recovery vehicle from a HEMMT or something so that he can use it on his mountain.
11:57 nice way of fixing potholes - you just put there a lawn mower. :D
Don’t understand the junk lawnmower crushing? Y’er just gonna have to pick up all them pieces and parts, so why bother?
I don't know.....glad nobody got killed.
Good content. 👍
Well that went well then 😂🤣😂
I guessing that Andrew is going to get his dozer with its heavy winch next. And/or Will Andrew buy a heap (Bunch) of cable and multi sheave snatch blocks... and use the forest forwarder as well. Anyway, a truck with stuff from 'jhina', with a new belt repair kit for his crusher will arrive. Then Andrew fixes the crusher, with some new hydraulic thingamajig belt puller-installer. Saying 'It's amazing what you can find on that internet nowadays'.
Get some heat in there. That way you can work comfortably.
More content to vicariously entertain us!
Dude I been waiting for you to get a compactor for so long
Waw. First time ever I've seen so many extreme actions in one single Video.
So if it's like that with lawn mowers bruh, I'd feed them to the rock crusher 😎
I was wondering why you didn't winch it out backwards?? Have a little help from gravity and be able to steer the drum a little easier. Just curious
Small engine repair shop
Ya, moving a multi ton roller up a frozen mountain road in the winter, what could go wrong? Luckily no one died...!
At least it remained upright! LMMAO! I admire you guys! If it were me, I'd wait till Spring! Lol. Thanks for updates!
Did anyone notice what seemed like an electrical flash up the hill,  when the tree got pulled out just before 40.48?   I  woke up at 4.30am  (UK time) I thought  just have a look on the iPad check the news, see what’s on YouTube.  AC has a video out, so I watched it (with no sound ). I’ll watch it properly tonight. Great entertainment as always.
Oh wow so much for the tree.
shake n bake all gas no brake
What is this new mountain project going to become a home or something else??  Also how long is the driveway?
The service part went well , the rest didn't do anything for me.
36:39 - Cody was like - "Why are you all doing this? I dont get it" 😀
I don’t understand why andrews property being up on a mountain why it is so dam muddy and wet all the time ?
That sort of reminded me of the scene in Roger Rabbit. Glad no one got hurt.
"Almost", almost as bad as when the crane tipped over !
Man...throw that beaten up RAM off a cliff, that thing is now a trash can. Buy yourself a newer one. :) Cody looks kinda thin, what's up with this guy?
Andrew I think you need to look into yankum recovery ropes. I watch several people that use them for heavy farm machinery, they make like a 3 inch recovery rope incase you want to move a recover a mountain.
beeuuuty mate, always wondering when you are going to get around to getting something or finding a new way to do things and being able to record it all on vids for us to enjoy
Not sure but wouldn't make the put alot easier if someone was on it trying to drive it forward as you pull on it just a thought
What a cluster that turned into. The drone footage makes for some great shots.
Did anyone catch why they removed the roof?? If they said it I missed it
Nice Galion roller! A bit of a pucker moment trying to recover it from the icy slope!
Things turn to shit pretty quick sometimes you can be lucky.
As for the lawnmower, I think we can rub that out! As for the tractor, now thats just wasteful!
You're a glutton for punishment. 👍👍🙂🇨🇦
Is it hydrostatic drive do you need the engine running and in gear to move the wheels ? Dead pull ? Cheers from Aus
Now he needs a black hawk to lift the roller from the woods.
Is that Andrews little brother?
That is a good friend if he comes up the mountain with his new truck and the slides into your truck and keeps on helping you even afterwards and doesn't leave
“It ain’t fun anymore” 😂🤣 Andrew is lying 🤥
Need to get some bigger trees
At least it didn't flip.
I can’t remember the brand, maybe toro, of the mower Andrew used and the manufacturer didn’t like the video, well I bet that brand would flatten the easiest.
Damn couple of times I thought everything was going over the side that got rid of all the dead trees
Safety sam does not approve of this video 🤣  god dayum you guys need to watch some general safety videos. Poor anchor points, improper sized chains, people and dogs standing in whip zones of chains and cables. Come on guys, you know better than to shake hands with danger
Just curious, how much does that roller weigh?
Pretty much an all-time high for pucker's per video
Yeah, the Skidder is made to pull trees to it. you chain the skidder to some (more than 1) trees and then pull logs (or rollers lol) to you. You also need chains that are rated for the weight and tinsel strength of load.  I'll give you one thing, my butt would have sold it all after it started pulling me over the hill! LOL
wow video
Just glad no one was hurt my have to get out the dozer one pulling and one pushing just be safe Andrew thanks 🙏👍
😂 NEVER a dull moment with Andrew. I’ve been waiting for a new upload for a lil bit. So good.
You may want to try two winches next time. That ice is slick, but the view at the end was beautiful.
#8 on trending? Been watching for a few years and it is crazy how well your channel has done Andrew
Andrew, you should have anchored the log skidder to a tree in front of it so you could use the log skidder to pull....
Weld corks on the big dozer, it’ll pull the roller up the hill
Need to bring out your dozer for that job
So that how machines get stuck in the woods and people walk away...
Are the rear wheels turning slower than the drum? Maybe tires are wrong size?, maybe why diff was full of “anti seize “
37:48 - I yelled at the screen - *_now there's the tool for the job.._*
What. Only a million OSHA violations, but oh what a ball. I almost pissed .myself when both machines came crashing down. Excellent video my friend.😎
"its an ignorable fire" LOL!!!
Muito bom!! (Brazil)
No one has considered the danger that is posed to Cody and Blue. Given how much you love your canines, I am shocked that you do not consider the danger they are in as is apparent in this situation. I would hate to see one of those dudes get injured. You made some bad decisions in this video, both for you, you helpers, and your dogs. It is unbelievable that people find this amusing. It is incredibly dangerous; and negligent.
If you don't know anything about Rigging don't assume you know what you are doing
Never a dull moment!
Take those mowers to Taryl.  What do you do with all the old grease from track adjusters?
That's a nice looking mack Rd..great video as always!
You made a few mistakes right off the bat. 1. Trying to pull that up that hill with a pick up truck. 2. You need bigger stronger chains. 3. You need to pick a tie off point stronger than a dead tree the first time for the snatch block and 4. The biggest mistake of all not tieing off that skidder to a point up the road on the initial winch pull. A little planning and proper equipment and no one gets hurt. You got lucky.
Just now watching this video and he just post recovering a stuck roller great timing
He helped me realize that I was in danger of HELL and Judgement.   Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                           ,/..///////////////.,.,/.
Awesome😊
just when it was getting good to ! !
Wow that’s a very interesting way to make potholes in the shape of lawnmowers….😂
Its like watching the Motley Crew in Action....... trying to deliver a roller up a icy muddy track , what could go wrong...... thank god for the trees.
Playing kid games with man sized machines. Cost time, diesel and money. Thank God no one got hurt.
ANDREW COME ON BRO WE NEED YOU GUYS ALIVE NOT DEAD THANK GOD NOBODY WAS HURT OR KILLED I THINK THE COLD GOT TO YOUR GUYS BRAINS OR WHAT?
Pucker factor certainly increased there a little bit.
Seems to me he needs to figure out how the water got in the thing or next time it rains he still has a problem
“Alright, that’s how that looks” 🤣🤣
Where's Roger Rabbit when you need him?
andrew : now you have better resting area , vi-bro
32:30 Never seen a roll back on a dumpster truck before. Very cool. Wonder if Dumpster Dave built that himself?
Never a dull moment
Why didn't you use your D7 with the winch.
Hope you still have that dozer w the cable hoist.   bring that up there to pulll it out.  If the road up isnt frozen it should have the bite to get up or down the road and drag the roller up the hill
Hahahahaha I'm dying laughing, Andrew says " I don't know why I got in this " as the roller pulling the jeep with . Oh man your a gem Andrew, keep up the fun and success, 👍
Camarata: ok class, this is how you run a compression test on lawn mowers
You might need a wrecker recovery team.
Talk about a cliff hanger lol
Great video Andrew! They get better and better. Maybe the dozer can pull it out? Good luck.
Pure entertainment!
Thank god you posted a video…. I was going into withdrawal
Make that a t shirt "At least it's still right side up"😊
Dude... you sure you're not from the South?
Sign and sell the mower on Ebay.
u dogs never listen to you
That was intense.
I would have to grade this exercise as a really dumb video.  Not only have you endangered other lives but your own.
LMAO.    Surprised someone didn't get hurt.
The big dozer and wheel loader
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 for 47:46
Good video ..real tense moments  in the end ..👍👍
This is a fine mess you've gotten us into, Ollie
Wow time to replan the best way to get it back on the road. I have total confidence you will do just that!! Good luck! Stay safe a nd be well will be watching for the next update Take  care.   Bob Bitchin!!
Every time it rolled further down...I kept thinking that's much better!!! 😏
Couldn't the big excavator and/or the block & tackle inch it up the embankment and back on the road? Take the chainsaw and cut some fat wedges/blocks out of stumps and block the big tires when you get to a stopping point, then reset, and pull it farther up, block again, and pull again? It's always easier in hindsight, eh?
.
Take that lawnmower back on warranty.  Tell them you don't know what's wrong with it.  Video their response for us.  Lol
One of these days we are my gonna be reading about Andrew being dead from an equipment accident.  Thousands of people watch him and think he does things the way everyone else with equipment does it, when sadly it couldn't be further from the truth
Easy way to crush your beer cans.
Ending better than expected, and good luck on the next chapter. Some heavier chains maybe, some better anchor points maybe, and some good planning. But great video content.
SHOULD'VE CALLED THIS ONE SHENANIGANS.  10:14 ALL THE POOR KIDS IN VIETNAM WHO GO TO SLEEP WITH NO LAWNMOWERS. 36:24 THAT'S WORSE.....OH WELL!! 41:25 THIS'LL GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY OF FACE-IN-PALM FROM YOU TUBE'S VIRAL VIDS........   WOW JUST WOW!!!!!!!!!!
@HeavyDSparks recovery!
Wow that really sucks probably wait until spring time to get that moved. Keep making videos there all great.
"Hopefully, that's.. probably going to be interesting" - No kidding, haha! If you haven't already pulled it off, I'd be thinking of bringing an excavator or track loader down (or up) to build a good berm behind and try to smooth its re-entry path onto the road out also. Could probably benefit from some of those mega straps and/or kinetic straps/ropes rated for industrial/farm machinery! Those jolts are a high shock load blowing those chains apart - system could use a little 'give' to ease peak loading - same principal for climbing ropes.  Recovery part of this video was pucker factor 11 - Cody/Blue going at it right in the middle of it all - best content on youtube!
time to bring the dozer :D
ALL RESPECT FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO. I,VE BEEN A FAN FROM THE BEGINNING. THANK YOU,👍👍👍👍👍💙💛❤👍👍👍
YouTube wants CONTENT - HOPE they enjoy this  "CANDID"  content!!! You know, some of this 'content' is edge of your seat because no matter how we reach for the screen or yell.  "WE"  just cannot help!  (A real Cliff Hanger"!)  Thanks all!
You should start it up and have it help climb no vibration
Did you add water to the drum?
Number 8 on trending!
I've skidded lots of logs and pulled fully loaded log trucks with that skidder machine, you have all you need in power just use more shives in your block-and-tackle set up.  That was a real "hold my beer " situation if I ever saw one! Great stuff. Work out your problem like always and stay alive.
What a cliff hanger…! 🥴
Cody: "I think it's a shit show"
Andrew you left us and the roller literally both hanging...Cant wait till part 2 (the rescue)
Andrew, i truly hurt for you after all the preparation you performed on the roller and now find it "abandoned" here. I gotta tell you though I have NEVER been entertained like this EVER! You work very hard and have lots of talent and a great thinking mind. Videos are excellent but i'm sorry what you are experiencing now, I will "stay tuned."  Please, you and your crew stay safe!
Bringing your large excavator down from the blast site is definitely necessary for recovering that roller....
He usually goes and gets the right tool for the job.  Musta been far for a bigger recovery equipment
Andrew, you  have an update on that rock crusher anytime soon?
Need some heavy machines as anchor and with atleast 2-4 snatch-blocks.
My, you fellows have certainly gotten yourselves in a pickle!  Can't wait for the next episode of this cliffhanger.
Diesel Creek style while not admitting it.
😛😛🦾🦾🦴🦴👍👍👍👍
This is one of the all time great AC videos!!!!
andrew you need to get some proper recovery gear. check out matts offroad recovery! get some yankum ropes!
Andrew likes sending thing into the 2D world a lot.
I lost it laughing when the roller goes backwards and "ohhh that's WAY worse"
What a sweet machine!
Andrew: the Master of understatement.
Mower for sale. Ran when parked
Love it brother, doing exactly what every little boy insides us thinks and wants to do when getting a new toy. Proper disposal of that lawn equipment, so roadside freebies are safe in Upstate NY. =)
Dozer
Hey can I borrow your roller? I have a few lawnmowers to take care of.
Andrew get a backhoe or a dozer cut in a shallow road bring the roller out  replace the road work  those light chains were a disaster waiting to happen lucky you did not lose the roller. Good luck my friend.
36:16. That whole, truck slides, he hops in, camera stabilizes, wonders why he hopped in, then you see the roller going in the mirror. That whole segment has me dying 😂
Hope Justin is ok!
👌
I wanna know where is the international paystar 5000 dump truck that was built for heavy hauling
I want an $8000 lawn mower crusher too
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Driving it up the road like that was dumber than dumb, hard lesson learned, but you'll do it again :-P
The camera is always deceptive about the steepness of the road. Can you do a video showing the grade , very steep.  We live for these videos
Put out the HEAVY D BAT SIGNAL!!!
Absolutely loved the video as always! But I think you put too much trust into chains and steel cables :/
That could have gone better lol... But it could have also gone Way worse.
If potholes are that easy to fix there should never be any.
@36:18  Was just thinking, dude looks relaxed on that roller. And the part, how does the door open.
Definitely on the edge of your seat viewing!!! Better than Yellowstone!!!! Lol
Grade A+ video. Absolutely amazing. Can't wait for the next one.  that water was cleaner than what comes out of my taps. Oh, I know what it was... the previous owner ran moonshine whisky in that roller. Hid the whisky in the oil pan...
Andrew, I really glad you called it before something bad happened or someone might have gotten hurt, injured or worse, I've been in those situations myself on logging sites with hilly steep ground it's not fun like you said. As always God bless yah from Gaffney South Carolina viewer 🙏❤️💯
#9 on trending this channel has gone so far. Go check out the rest of Andrews videos lost of great stuff for those of you who are new I recommend watching him building the compound he is at now.
He done told me he was gunna get one, for to pound all that rock road base down, and save the chains and sprockets on his crawlers.   Glad to see this!
Sketchy Sh!t song is playing in my head
YO YOUR TRENDING !!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A bull dozer it isn’t!
Roller 1, lawnmower 0
The mower can sell as wall art.
That’s good work, but it’s mighty dirty work.
Wow that is definitely a sketchy situation be careful love the videos
We went from nail biting tense cable pulls at the end to a temporary save resting place and then the beauty of the snow covered mountains.  Well done Andrew!!
Andrews videos have more exciting and more drama than Bollywood films.
I always wondered how old equipment was found in the middle of nowhere. 😂 love the videos! They are so entertaining.
Send that mower over to Taryl and say “there’s your dinner”!
What's even more mind boggling is, even with all that equipment he still can't build/maintain a driveway worth a darn. Rookie for life!!!
OMG so glad no one died. This video brings a whole new meaning to “ sketchy”. AF.  Look after the dogs! Love your videos, but this one had me on the edge. Better than a Hollywood horror movie!
oh dear.
Maybe cut in a new road lower then the roller.
I settled in with my plate of fried Vienna sausages to see if you could compete with my redneck hillbilly southern brothers. You could be a proud member!
This iz much better than watching a tank or bulldozer run over some thing again !!!
Use that D7 winch it will pull it out.
That's some sketchy shit
This problem will require the Bell and a couple of dozers.
Oh man I think I shit myself
I was happily shocked to see one of your videos trending #9. Congrats!
"Shoulda put tire chains on" Truer words, my man...
At least it’s still right side up!!  😆😂😂😂
30:00 A little post10 action!
Trying to make due. Instead of going big. Going big would of save a big problem and probably saved some time and money in the long run. We learn from our mistakes. --- Great New Year video, any New Year resolutions from this?
44:35 bloody hell!
Lardy, lardy Andrew!  Had me a bundle of nerves watching the last 15 minutes of this one. Can’t wait for the follow on video to see how you get that roller back in the road!  Be safe guys!
Does New York have some kind of lawn mower problem where they need to have old lawn mowers crushed?
❤️🇺🇸GREAT VIDEO❤️🇺🇸 glad you’re all safe! I never realized the weight of a roller and tell it started pulling the SKIDDER BACKWARDS with chains on ALL FOUR💩💩
This kids brain is dying very fast
Didja break it?  Edit after watching: kinda.
You're gonna need your bulldozer
Maybe use the CAT buldozer winch and the skidder together.  Like a Really BFH
He'll probably get into asphalt paving before too much longer.
Andrew shakes hands with danger!
He used that machine for so long running on water for lubricant lmao.
One of my co-workers died when a roller tipped over.  Name was Shane.  Be safe!
Crazy video ..I loved it. Thanks for the thrills Andrew.
For sale : Riding mower for parts only. No low ballers, I know what I have!
Well, that was a cluster.
Please, please, please bring the mower to a repair shop and film it!!!
the shot at 37:49 is so cool
‘That looked like an ignorable fire’ Really needs to be on a t shirt!
Came here to see carnage, was not disappointed. 👍
More fun than a barrel full of monkeys, on a more serious note this man has worked hard to get where he is today, I just hope that someday someone doesn't get seriously hurt or maimed and he loses everything he worked so hard for.
At 44:30, when the roller and skidder started rolling downhill, I puckered!
Really really love the videos just don't get hurt!!! That was awesome!
Nothing a dozer and winch won’t pull out! 😊
I think someone is going to be spending a metric fu*k ton on mass quantities of 5/8 chain
This guy gets dumber every damn video
When is Andrew gonna replace his ram? I think a new daily driver would be another truck but a ram 3500 brand new in my opinion and keep the 2500 for a plow truck just my thought
That was a job for a big dozer, PERIOD!
On the next video can we see a lawnmower repair? HMMM
My thoughts regarding the Roller.  Chock it in place so it's safe.  Wait until spring, not that far off really!  Once you've got some dry soil to work with get your dozer with the Hyster 80K winch on it and position yourself in the most advantages position using the cable and come alongside if needed and retrieve the machine.  Another thought I just had which might make it easier?  Pull the roller out backwards so your pulling against the tires and in the center of the machine while the roller just follows behind.
Wish I lived closer to you would love to help fix your stuff
another scammer
Andrew you needed to build a road.behind the roller to get it out
This was a high quality pucker factor video.
Should have gotten one of your buddies on there to articulate it back out straight again Instead of leaving it turned
Two things: glad everyone's ok. Second thank goodness for a skidded, that Fords Hitch and a 24 valve stout steel bumper.
Always an adventure with you for sure. 😊
i wanna see more cheapest things on market place.
You're going to have to get yourself some kind of six-by-six sanding device you got all the other toys
wild ride, glad  everyone is ok and safe
If you can't say "luckily no one got hurt" after telling the story about one of your adventures it wasn't an adventure
Expecting a easy going video.  Sitting on the edge of my seat here.
That was nuts, I was figuring we were going to find out how you broke your Leg!!!
Would love to see the castle finished.
19:52 stop eating food with greased fingers.  A guy at work used to do that. He dies of liver cancer.
Oh that’s way worse  Classic
You best line, delivery and inflection, all in one: 45:15
That was getting interesting!
Andrew I like all your content,  but what's up with so many commercials.
Boy that turned into a shit shit right fast at the end.. id say a parking brake for roller be a must in near future working in the hills
@Andrew,You did double flare the brake line, off camera ?
"Be careful doing what I'm doing" - what a classic Camarata tagline! (9:36)
Ok  the mowers , interesting, impressive, and cringe able.  Impressive machine,. congratulations
Kind giving off those Whistln Diesel vibes
What the hell was he thinking of ???,  - that machine must weigh  15 ton  easy,  the only thing capable of pulling something that heavy up and out of there will be a D8 with short doubled up chains ,     pulling a machine  that kind of weight up a bumpy one in four slope doubles its dead weight  so a thirty ton machine in my estimation would be the only way of doing it without killing anybody  - as  almost evidenced several times there where it came very close.     the only other way I can see would be to track it DOWN the hill onto flatter ground if that is possible. Although he nearly had it at one point-  if he had taken that rock lip off the top first it may have done it.
Call Triple AAA....
No clickbate here, most youtubers would have the title as 'WE ALMOST DIE 5 TIMES!!!'
ROAD ROLLER DA
need to fix a pothole? just put a lawnmower in it and vibe it.
bring down the large excavator and a dump but have fun hilarious to watch. stay safe
You guys are getting crazier with each video.😮😟.
The things you do to keep us on the edge of our seats.
*Andrew, how long a drive is it from your first property to your new maintain-top property ?*
Andrew it was awesome to see the Castle garage home base again, in the video. Still looking forward to the garage addition build where your truck lift is.
Back the skider up to a big tree
Question - If it can't make it up the road, how will it roll the road?
Hi Andrew from northwest Missouri you should totally take the mowers in and see if they can fixem lol and video it all bud
Andrew you should really service the vibratory unit up front if the rest of that roller was in that shape
As of right now I am unsubscribing from this channel! The incident shown here could have been deadly!! It was preventable!
That mower will buff out
What!?  Blasphemy!   No use, or mention of a Yankum rope?   What kind of roller recovery was that anyways?
It looks like you need another heavy machine. Anything heavy to anchor the skidder. The winch seems plenty strong. Might even punch a little driveway for the roller to come up, lessening the grade.
You need a good block in tackle and 3 to 4  Anchor points
Dude seriously, watching you attempt to recover that roller when it went downhill…you have some of the biggest dozers and loaders caterpillar makes, use them. Y’all are lucky you didn’t get killed
You going to get killed .. God help you ..
One thing for sure it isn’t going beat Andrew!!!!!!!
I laughed. I cried. It became a part of me.
Well that was the most nerve racking video I watched on YouTube in a long time…or ever
Battle of TITANS!
Andrew tuh Buldoser end Skida and des Maschin gou raut
So dangerous but fun to watch
They say that genius and insanity sometimes look similar but here we have no such thing. Just Andrew being Andrew, nothing to see here, next video please.
No need for the rock crusher.  It flattens crushes all in one go
21:50, Now thats what i call maintenance comedy.  heres your glass of pure engine water 😂😂!!!
I guess mowing the yard this summer is out of the question.
Don't leave your lawnmower at Andrew's place!
Man you jumped out and the big machine with no brakes was rolling.... had me going for a sec.
Well, not that one .
nearly drags a skidder over a bank, hops out, "meh I don't like that" ... ya nobody in their right mind thinks thats a good time my dude. get one of them big dozers you have up there on it, drag it right up on to the road.
12:19 😂😆😂😆😂
I can still fix it !!
Incredibly interesting .
The roller that keeps on rolling.
That’s a different way to lower the blade on that mower. And then there was that damn mountain…
Next episode, Andrew fixes lawnmowers.
What a predicament. That roller was fight them every step of the way. The video does not do justice to the extent of the terrain but you can tell things are steep and slick. I believe it is time for bigger chains and another piece of equipment to secure the skidder
I think he needs the dozer with the wench and the skidder working together to get that roller outta there.
You should have had Youtuber Post 10 clean that culvert.
i appreciate that Andrew finds time for other projects amidst his busy schedule of replacing skid steer tracks
👍👍👍😁
Is that the first time Andrew says he's not having fun anymore, just a little skechy.
Excellent p
You built your channel by doing jobs for others!  It was entertaining.  Now you just buy machines and build your road.  Like to see you do jobs for customers and plow snow.
Mowers are tuffer than I expected...
Out of all your videos and dangerous shit you do this is the worst,  this is the dumbest thing you’ve done yet, keep it up and your gonna buy the farm !
Камарата классно !
it ends on a cliff hanger damn my week is going to be all stress out lol
Can anyone fill me in, is there a big project Andrew is building up for? I've seen the last few machines and blowing up the rock, but is there a big goal?
When lives are put in harms way, it's time to throttle back. It just ain't worth it, Andrew.
A N G E R   M A N A G E M E N T   ? ? ?   LOL
Next Video - Building a road to save a roller.
45:47 why he not just turn on the roller and help is self  out ?
Betting call Mats Off Road recovery!
just your normal roller experience right here
"That looks like an ignorable fire"  I love it.
44:35 god damn never had anything that stuck before
Always awesome drama with Andrew can’t wait to see the rest of this one
Surprised you chose the skidder over the dozer
holy shit that was crazy. the recovery  is going to be intense. wounder if the big wheel loader would pick it up out of there. hmmmm.
all the gear and NO idea
Need to call Rory of Moab Motor Sports and Matt from Matt’s Off Road Recovery for technical assistance!
well son i would say you had to change your skivies more than one on this video
What brand is the roller and what motor?
I have watched this channel for several years now. Andrew I am very concerned about your safety! Your video today was over-the-top! It was the sketchiest thing I've ever seen you do. This compact roller and the way you took it up the mountain is not child's play this is serious stuff. Andrew you are a very smart person. Moving heavy equipment like that is a very serious proposition. You are going to need that bulldozer and other heavy equipment to stabilize that roller to get it up on the incline.
You're going to need to fire up that D7....
when are you going to make a video of buying something so large it will crush the largest piece of equipment you have?
I thought you have big machines at your mountain top? That skidder probably weighs 1/2 of that roller
I think I identified what is wrong with that lawn tractor; it has  flat battery.
Watching that chain stretch at 44:12 with .25 playback speed wow
Andrew does his own stunts…..   honestly I was worried a bit watching this roller nearly kill a few people
I'm going to come right out and say it, there is no way in hell Andrew lives to a ripe old age. He does far too many stupid things and unfortunately will end up killing himself. I am sad to say this but it is unfortunately becoming quite obvious.
Use the skidder and the d7 wench to get it out
C L I F F H A N G E R
That's exactly what you need for up at the camp! Nice and slow turn the vibration all the way up and just let everything settle right into every little crevice!
this went bad fast
I guess the engine on the ,power was a flathead.
Next video starts with a safety meeting? :)
a padfoot is better at breaking up rock, just saying.
You left us with a cliffhanger ending?
Another great video . Only Andrew can make the crushing of rocks into a dramatic saga , totally interesting and entertaining , love it !
Looks like a side road is in order.
No wonder peoples equipment breaks down, no manitance. Must of been sitting in a flood zone to get all that water 💧.  Good luck.
um.. build a "recovery road"?... I mean.. you have the machines.. the land.. maybe not the time... but I'd hate to see that new toy get broke....  good luck!  I wanna know what happens next...
Shouldve called Heavy D Sparks for recovery
Are you buy a rock hammer for the big excavator
That roll off flatbed setup is really damn cool
Love watching the rigging expertise.
The tail was wagging the dog on that mountain.  Glad nobody got hurt.
Lucky you guys don't get killed!
Dang that differential oil looked a little metallic.
If they made a netflix collection for Andrew it would be like a never ending series after series and kids and adults just binge watching and learning stuff
44:22 😳
That track change was impressive. Never seen it done almost 100 percent  with machines
Goes from bad to worse to worser to worserer to worserest!!!!! Why the heck would you continue to make the same mistake over and over and over again!! Needed to contribute some of it's power to assist it's way out. Thanks for the entertainment value of this video!!! More!! More!!! They chanted!!! 😄😃😂
Can’t wait to show my dad this video , he loves hassle and awkward jobs
Ended this episode on a real cliff-hanger.
Total wild man, so much fun to watch. All your videos seem to fly by like all good things in life.
Wow you gotts problem there ! Hope it all works out OK, am certain it will. This (I believe) is the three mile road up to the Mountain top. A rough road that improves every video. Some task. Geez you got some gear now ! Will there be a wood processing outfit coming soon ? Perhaps a helicopter landing spot too ? Looks brilliant for the future Andrew, thanks :)
Well, did he git it out of there? I could not watch any longer. To many things wrong there!!
We know someone with 2 D7's and both of them have monster winches. That's what I'd be using. (But I'll admit I don't know shit compared to Andrew.)
Your all safe that's the main thing . Stay safe guys
Be careful making sparks around batteries they emit hydrogen gas. I've seen two of my young  mechanics have batteries blow up in their face and get acid in their eyes. Great deal on your new equipment, take care, Mike
“Who needs a rock crusher when you have a roller” lol see how that worked
I am shore no one wants to watch your funeral yet
Damn!!!!!
You need to look at the "F" around and find out chart, before you find out........Sketchy hooking a 6000lb truck to a 20,000lb ice skate, that could have gone real bad.
Didn’t think anyone else had a pipe flaring tool that old. I still use the one I have like it but anyway. 👍
Whenever I see equipment just left in the woods, I always wondered why someone would ever do that.  Well that question was answered today
Well that escalated quickly! The job's probably done by now, but if one snatch block is good two may be better. There's a name for four of them. (Block and Tackle for those who didn't know) Your gear is only as good as your anchor point. Sorry trees! LOL! "Give me a place to stand and a lever long enough and I can move the world" Looking forward to the resolution of this "situation"!
It's the dumb and dumber show.
When you work with heavy equipment you know it's no mucking about start being bit more serious
use the bulldozer to create an on ramp
I guess driving it thru the trees at the shallow part is NOT possible ?
D7?
Like that you teach your friends & not keep all experiences for yourself.
I think that almost qualified as an incident pit. It's good you walked away.
You guys are p pkaying with your life safety first you know it's ice on the mountain  but you still take chances untill you do something bad to somone
Ребята, очень хороший контент! Смотрю прям, нарадоваться не могу! Специально так портачить можно только на камеру!
“Alright, that’s how that looks” lmao
Always scarier than a horror flick. Good luck and be careful.
Wow, that metal bar holding the battery in place looks like a incredibly bad design!
Andrew, I thought you had a large Cat?
With a couple of more pulleys you ca double the power of the wench .
Andrew, check out the Goodall 10,000amp jump box, i have a break down service in Tennessee and dude you need one for them dozers and equipment's you have  i just got mine it will make the starter jump off the motor but it's safe, check it out on YouTube on j.c smith projects he has a good review.
When I video pops up and starts playing then you hear the voice you haven't heard in a while.  Your like oh that's Andrew!!!
I can't wait to see how you end up getting that roller out. I'd probably throw a couple more chains on it to keep it in one place then grab it once it warms back up. I guess thats why we're watching you do stuff and not the other way around.
Is there a machine you don't have yet that you would like to have Andrew?
Is the Roller still sitting there?
Andrew's one of the few dudes that it doesn't really have to worry about getting burned at an auction...he can fix it anyways
Best use of a cheap lawnmower I've ever seen
Shame them dogs will fetch but weren't taught give it to me.
Laughed a bit
Surely better off giving them to Mustie to fix.
You probably figured it out by now but you need some snatch blocks to give you at least a 4:1 advantage.
What are you gonna do, ka,ka,ka, Ken? You gonna ka, ka, ka, kill me? (a Fish Called Wanda movie reference for those who don't get it)
You would not want to run over your scheisse esser with that....
Time to get the dozer and skidder with bigger chains and cables.
Try to find a coyote to run over!
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin, move em out round em up RAWHIDEEEE!!
The machine at some time was in deep water,a flood or something, and probably a bad seal, so check the vibrating drum, hey these machines are at auction sometimes for a reason other than ( a company update ), just a thought,iam not an expert.
your the only one that dose not put sub son please every time as a lot can not hear you and need to read one day you may be the same and why you buy in winter but in summer then you not have ice
Wow, look at all that greenery!..Spring has come awfully early to New York State!😆
Ok I see a lot of things on you tube but a steel mounting bracket under the battery positive cable?
OOOOOPPPPS Guess I should have put on the chains.....too late Andrew.
Use a big bull dozer and pull that compactor back up and out off that hole and up the mountain!!!
What is that thing he holds out the window while driving
I wonder when the roller got stuck does Andrew think,  "Crap this sucks!", or does he think "This video is going to be awesome!".  Great video Andrew!
Free mower, run when parked.
When you start wrong it never goes right
TANK RETRIVER!! That's what you need. If I see a M-88 or 88A1 for sale at a show, do you want to know?
@Andrew Camarata: just build a small road kind of downhill but backwards to the original road instead of trying to pull the roller uphill
The last 10 minutes had some excitement - nobody got hurt
I can’t wait for you to upload the getting it unstuck video. That’ll be epic!
Those gradalls are some slick machines, I’m a real big fan of them
Who doesn’t like watching this. There is no drought that roller will be pulled out.
The next video will b the cat hooked to the roller getting done lol great video man Ice is dangerous for sure
Anybody get the impression that Andrew doesn't like lawnmowers?
Dam dude posting cliff hangers now huh,… it started out with the ghost ride lol …come on part two 👍👍👍👍
Dude use your Excavator already WTF.
the definition of f* round and find out...
stupide that andrew you no better
Send it to Steves Small Engine Saloon...
Either the big dump truck or take the roller off and pull it out in two pieces......(professional YTube sofa expert)
I think that andrew should all new vehicles so he doesn't have to fix them all of the time, although it would be expensive I think he could afford it.
D7 dozer to pull that roller out
You will have the best roads in America Andrew 🇺🇸 lol
Bro he did not part 2 this im already invested
How many miles on that Ford now? It just keeps on going...
This was great
I watched half of it, switched it off. Too many adverts.
OMG, IT'S like watching a train wreck in slow motion.
This could be something an epic collab video if he chain up the roller with the assistance of a seasoned YT Recovery Pro, ie *Matt's Offroad Recovery.* Or maybe he needs to call HeavyDSparks?
They have gravity up there in New York as well......whodathunkit?
Sucks to get stuck, really would have benefitted from new tires😢
Chatgpt will NEVER replace the Camaratas of the world.
This may have been the first Andrew Camarata video where I was seriously nervous. Need the D8 with the wench. Always appreciated!
Roller's gonna roll...
And I thought I was having a rough day 😂😂
Any other YouTuber would put some crazy thumbnail and title on this vid to attract all the viewers. Andrew puts a modest pic and title on it and STILL brings in all the views!
"It looked like an ignorable fire." New quote just dropped.
That's not delivery.  That's DiGiorno.
Its ok that you bought equipment without brakes because at least you made sure it had the auto-unload feature.
Nice
A question for someone in the know - why did the roller drum not freewheel when the unit was being towed (almost) up the bank? On the flip side, the fact that it didn't probably prevented the whole thing careering down the hill.  Next indoor project - a drive motor & pulley for that roller-door chain.
10:17 lawn mower broke for no reason. They really need to engineer them better. It should be able to withstand that.
Has anyone ever heard Andrew say “I dont like this” when it comes to pulling heavy equipment around with little chains?
Apparently, you gave that roller free reign for saying ghost ride in the beginning of the video. Sucks where it lies. You know tho.
The only Girl that almost made a roller jump! and that's just off a mower..  Nice work !!  EDIT* And then Andrew has to better it and see what he can do using a sit on mower as a ramp !!  ;)
It looks like a rotator wrecker is needed. Fear not, Adrew will pick one up, else the roller will be at the bottom of the mountain. Have good days!
i dont like watching you destroy things i like watching you fix things cause your good at it and do things the way i would just to get the job dun
To what end Andrew?? To prevent pot holes??? If it is its genius
Bulldozer
Andrew those FLAT DRUM ROLLERS are designed for heavy compaction of relatively smaller materials like crushed gravel, for that wonderful shaley rock you seem to have plenty of, a PAD FOOT ROLLER would break up easily in no time, flat drums will do a half job but it's not good for them, and please don't vibrate static it will destroy the machine, I have had 40 years experience around both types of machines, All the best, Al
Acs wall art
Never a dull moment when Andrew comes on
Other YouTubers: ALMOST CRUSHED BY MY NEW ROLLER FALLING OFF A MOUNTAIN!!! Raw footage.  Andrew: buries the most stressful and honest content in a video.  I love this channel.
Wow, sorry about the stressful mess you got into in the end with your awesome, new roller. Great cliffhanger though. Looking forward to the next episode!  -----  One lawnmower I can kind of understand. But two lawn mowers is a pattern, I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the BLMA - bureau of lawn mower abuse. 🙂😆😅😂
Endless dumbness makes good content
Can’t wait for Part 2
Wow you had me WHOA  IN MY CHAIR I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING OVER
I thought I'm gonna watch a road beautification video, but it quickly escalates into apocalypses "Man and his war Machines" kind of movie! Wow.
Over two years in the making!
It probably wouldn't hurt for you to get some professional assistance because it's obvious you don't know what you're doing and are in way over you pay grade.
I think if you install a schrader valve on that mower you can blow it back up with the air compressor.
OMG scary or what. Be interesting to see the next video.
This whole time I'm like BRUH! Go get your damn dozer!
It's not often Andrew ends videos without conclusions
12:47 Cody: "Andrew breaks stuff all the time but shits gettin real with the roller"
She has the physique of a teenage boy. Strange. Never seen anything like it
Can you lower the roller down to a different area? or at least get it to a spot where it isn't so steep?
Facebook Market place.....  Used Lawnmower for sale, great condition, runs a lil flat., MINOR SCRATCHES.
I'll call that mower fixed!
I respect your effort not to quit Get the D7 out this spring and fix the road Or should I say trail That Mountain  is not going to give up Eventually you’re gonna want to get cement trucks up there
Great video!! Felt like I was in the thick of it with you. Looking forward to the resolution!!
Omg, that made me pucker multiple times! Just glad no one got hurt.
Andrew I don't understand why there is no electric door opener on your shop. instead you pull a chain.
I was on the edge of my chair watching all the sketchy going on here. I was really worried for the dogs hoping one of those cables didn’t break! When I was younger I had a freak accident where I was pulling a homemade box trap on a wagon. My German Shepard was running around playing as I relocated the box trap. Trap fell off wagon and landed on his head in the middle of a wide open field. Ended up needing put down 😢. It really just takes a second. And Anchor tow vehicle so you don’t get yanked off the Mt. Lol I bet that puckered the ole cheeks 😂 Cheers 🍻
Andrew you're getting careless. One of these days ....
put it on ebay...like new
Wow bro best video yet can't wait for more like this
Love your content and humor. Keep up the great work!
Holy shit that was entertaining. That driveway is bringing awesome content. Good job guys.
Talk about giving your peeps a stir up.  You certainly know how.
No wayyy it had that much water
Glad I subscribed. I want to see the upcoming rescue video!  Maybe bring in a couple of your bulldozers pulling and winching in unison.
Have ever thought of a hammer mill to work with your crusher. Buy a old cement truck use the cement mixer off the truck throw in 12 -16 pound steal balls roll them around inside and crush your bigger rock down to small stuff.
I'm glad you didn't kill your friend, really stupid to put him in danger.
"At least its still right side up" LMAOOOO
I gather that lawnmower was a product review 😂👍✌️
yikes.  early finalist of for the craziest badass of 2023.  love it.
try getting a Kenworth w900   I would love to see one on the channel
lmao
🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😩😩😥.    MY MAN  ANDREW 😟💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻😲😵😊
Time to bring out the D7
Don't you have a dozer with a winch?
WHAT !!!!!!! Andrew failed   !!    NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
“HEY!!!” It’s dumpster Dave?!!🤙🏼😁
The best video ever on Youtube  Andrew is the craziest guy on here had me jumping off the chair a few times that i thought was going to be the end of Andrew sure glad nobody got hurt but it was close cant wait for the second pat of this video.
we can't wait till the sequel !!!
Steproller is stuck 🥵
Time for the D8 on a warmer no ice day to pull it out
Pretty soon you can have your own auction
Poor boy must really have been hot to run under the truck instead of into it for a car ride. 😅😅
Andy, simply you're going to get someone killed.
AC definitely needs to watch episodes of "Highway Through Hell' to understand heavy recovery. This was a disaster from start to finish
i want a roll off truck like that
Andrew Andrew: "I'd like to return this lawnmower, it's defective" "Man, they don't make them good anymore" 😆
As a joke, Call "Matt's Off Road Recovery"
That poor Murray riding mower-I have the same model, and it's been running dependably for well over 30 years.
@ 42:00 never ever a dull moment when Andrew is around LMAO at least it's upright lol
I woulda started the roller up so it can help drive as you were winching.
You might be better off pushing the roller up the mountain with the skidder.  More control.
The most dangerous and irresponsible video that I have seen in a long time. Fortunately, everyone is alive and in one piece.
I have been watching AC videos since the early days and something I have often said to myself over the years is, “One day this guy is going to get himself, or someone else, killed.” Don’t get me wrong. I mean, it makes for great entertainment, and all but… someday your luck is gonna run out with all this sketchy equipment on steep terrain. I pray for you.
exciting. There's a reason you have over a million subs. I hope nobody ever gets hurt or they will take everything you worked for. Happens allll the time
I lose interest when Andrew has too much help or arrives at that mountain. Not knowing to not try something or not knowing when to quit is how people get killed or maimed.
cut across the hill and  build a spur and drive it out
post 10 would like the scene, cleaning out the culvert in the ditch.
One thing for sure. Never a dull moment with Andrew. He is definitely Mr. Adventure. Keep up the good work. God Bless.
My boss lost his life on a vibratory roller working a logging road on the coast of Oregon. Lost control somehow and went down the mountain side.  I think if you straighten out the roller and pull from the downhill direction of the road it will be less strain on the bull line and chains.
Andrew just bought the last piece of the,” How to Start Your Own County” puzzle!
camarata means 'dormitory'in italian, fyi
This video reminds me of old times. Working on a rigging gang and breaking stuff. It was a miracle nobody was killed. A few casualties but most got home at night. I love Andrew figuring things out. Does my soul good watching these kids.
Hello Jamie Davis....
Maybe turn it on and leave in gear so you aren’t pulling dead weight. It seemed like it wasn’t able to articulate and the tires seemed locked up.
I thought the tree roller was a great buy
I think the cat d7 with the pto driven winch will have no problem getting that out
Always wanted a low-profile mower. To get to those hard to reach spots.
If Andrew ever offers a packing service, maybe don’t ship your good stuff. 😊
I seen what was gonna happen before he did it. No knowledge.
OHH OHH THATS WAY WORSE!!!  I bout chitted myself !!!  hahaha
Like how dumb do you feel. What was the need to take it up a hill in the winter. 😄 🤣 😂
Non capisco il tuo inutile accanimento distruttivo nei confronti del tagliaerba e del trattorino.  E ancora di più non capisco come fai ad essere ancora vivo, visto quello che è successo nel trasferimento del rullo compattatore, e come hai provato a recuperarlo peggiorando solo la situazione.
I mean how many times do you need to roll a mower over with a roller?
It's nice to see a summer video in winter 😎❄
Any other YouTuber would have titled this "Runaway 10ton Roller almost kills us!!!" And made a nutty thumbnail with them grabbing their faces in fear.  Not Andrew.  He totally buries the lead :)
put some crushed stone down on that road before you go recover that thing
Where the hell are you that in January it's like summer time??
Never a dull moment
Time to fire up the D7”s those winches won’t care at all or perhaps walk big orange down the mountain and yank her out no sweat either way this will be an easy job for you with all the iron you have can’t wait to see it come out and get back to rolling crushed stone !! I wanna come up there so bad dude
Me watching this video 🥱🙂🤣😅🤔😁😄🤨🤔😲🫣🙀😅👏 bulldozer time
A pair of visegrips and a hammer you can fix anything.
Cool video Andrew. A little scary but cool.
Pull it down the road instead of up
At least it has fresh oil now! 🤣
Can’t wait for part 2!
You'll need two dozers in tandem, it's too steep and slippery
Andrew why just mount gopro on top bottom and sides  and use the footage
I enjoy watching clowns in action
It's just $8,000 dollars!!!!!
new toy for andrew!
Should've gone to the top and used the cat crawler to tow it up instead of the pick up truck....
If you hadn't smashed some things with the roller after purchase, I think you would have lost followers! Bravo sir 😂
kind of starting to see why sometimes you just see machines abandoned in the woods lol
isnt the battery holddown all metal and thus grounded to the minus pole of the battery? seeing that positive terminal block just mm apart from it makees me nervouse :)
nice
Hey Andrew, that was entertaining. Maybe pull the roller back down the hill until you get it back on the road.
Love the Cartoon Lawnmower .... Looked like a Acme product. Great machine
Lol awe video!!
Use the big bull dozer to pull the roller up and out?
You should just rename the channel "Andrew vs Gravity"
Only way to realise your alive is to do sketchy stuff.
Andrew does the things I imagine I would do behind the wheel of a steel roller  🤣😄👍
The next load of scrap metal you hall to the scrap yard will weigh triple now you can flatten the metal down to maximise load capacity.
Why keep loosening the cable?
do you check "pass" lots , we've done well with them.
Turn the Vib off when you switch directions
Try parking the skidder on the downhill side and rig the winch line off the tree.  Gravity is your friend.  Pull it straight across the lane and spin it 90 degrees once you get it on the flat
It's really sad. But also hilarious!  And finally, come on man 3/8 and chain, are you kidding me!
Andrew,  you needed just one more pulley. One at the tree one at the roller. Amazing chain reaction of crap going wrong.
Nice to see you have a great girlfriend who likes getting her hands dirty
Is Jesse Mueller going to end up with this roller Too ?
Get some stronger chains, and drive that skidder a few meter up the hill, anker the skidder to 2 big trees. That should do it! 👍🇸🇪
The D-7
PLEASE PLEASE don’t wait 3 weeks until the update
Drum seems light? can it be filled with water?
a real cliffhanger
Good parking spot. And I’m glad nobody rolled. ❤❤❤
Can't wait to see the D7 in action!
This is WAY more drama then I was expecting 😂😂😂😂
you have no idea how satisfying and therapeutic it was  to witness you Full Send on them mowers. lol Feeling a little sick at the moment but this helped. lolol
I guess there will a rescueway be built?
Need that big dump truck fill it full of rocks. Use that as anchor for the winch.
Andy you've got  almost as much equipment in your yard as  a Ritchie Brothers Auction site
Andrew sometimes you are your worst enemy. That roller has no business in the mts this time of the year. The guy riding the roller probably needs to change his pants. Good luck, buy some bigger chains and hook to a tree at least 50-60 feet higher up above the road. Chain the skidder  to a tree so it doesn’t slide.
Stay safe Andrew.  U get urself into some spooky situations.
I generally defer to your experience and trust your judgement, but I have to throw a flag at 21.48.  Agree it is water, but  please don't drink it or try to serve it in a restaurant.
" At least it is right side up"............... Brilliant.................... Andrews yardstick of a successful day. LOL
Boy what a pickle! Got your largest bulldozer on it with the winch you fixed up some time back. I don't know if he ever reads these things but that skidder is too light for the job.
is cody okay? he looks so skinny
Did your pal at 36:25 trip over the cable, bale out of the roller or just fall down?
That went well. 🙄
You know it's a good day when Andrew smashes something
GD… IF THAT ISN’T THE DEFINITION OF DISTRACTED DRIVING, I DON’T KNOW WHAT IS!!!🤕
I feel like you need some new friends. A good friend would have said, driving a heavy piece of equipment with no resemblance of having any traction up an icy steep mountain train was a bad idea. But it makes for a great video!!!
please bring it to a small engine shop. "cant get the thing to pull and i put gas in it". hahahaha.
sorry for the temporary loss of the roller...maybe it felt it was being abused running over lawnmowers and yard tractors and decided to fight back, in concert with Mother  Nature.  But it yielded some of the best content in a long time.  I'm sure this is only temporary.
Don’t you still have that big dozer with the winch line? Wouldn’t that be a better machine to use?
Wow!  Scary. ❤❤❤❤
You are so adventurous -- no one can guess what you are going to do next !!! Great videos Andrew  !! Keep up the great work !!
Am so glad none of you guys got hurt.  Take care and stay safe.
I'm glad no body was injured!!! Stay safe!
Did that lawnmower flatten out for no reason? Everything today is just made so cheaply.
That roller was built in my town Andrew, Galion Ohio...
Ima buy Cody and blue a OSHA hard hat and vest to keep you on your toes 🤣
I couldn’t help but notice you gas gauge was below E.
Holly crap! 😮
i love how you didnt put the crushing lawnmowers bit in the title, good way to reward the true fans :)
Holey roller batman !
10:30 are you finished servicing my gray push mower?
I recommend getting your big dog (largest excavator) to build a ramp which allows for a gradual pull up to the road at an angle.  You can always return the road to its current form.     Second step would be to create a block system to hold the roller when you need a stopping point and also to prevent a run away.     To get your max pull strength, maybe anchor your excavator as needed and use the boom to pull it forward to its next rest stop…rinse and repeat until you’re out.  I would seriously recommend the pull straps that Heavy D uses and save your chains for times that won’t snap them.
Was that Dumpster Dave helping Andrew fix some things on that roller ?
If your threw some oil and a new plug in that murray mower it would probably run
9:45 shake hands with danger
dang man, not a great day.  Im glad you shared it with us, and hope you can get it all back together.  it looks like you have a couple stout trees above you on the hill, so that may be an option, to pull from the trees.  your other option is to take another look at the placement of the road and see if theres a less steep option before you put all the stone in.  This could be a good sign that its time to move the road to a better place.  make it longer and less steep?
hook the  skidder to  a tree in the front and then hook a chain to the roller and  wrench it on  the road
No fixin that mowers motor
From funny to sketchy to dangerous. This was very entertaining. Squished lawn mowers available in the merch store !!
Video covers all bases, buying, compaction, flating recyclable goods and fixing 🤣👌with a little PUCKER Factor also 🤏
That could have been a hell of a ride be careful out their Andrew we all want to see u on the next one healthily 👍
Hey Andrew do you have a class A cdl here in fl your setup that your hauling has to be class A
Andrew’s off-road recovery
LOL .. Crusher!!  🤣  If you can walk away .. it's a good landing!!!
You might be a redneck if you crush lawnmowers with a roller packer
Wow! This episode became way more exciting then i thought it would be. Glad everyone is OK, that looked really sketchy when everything started to roll backwards. Good luck in episode 2.
You take too many chances and end up having failures like this. I really think if you would have had someone power up the roller and assisted, you would not have broken the chains.
Has anyone an old lawnmower for sale, anyone?
Without a doubt the most entertaining part of my afternoon thumbs up keep up the good work. 😎🇺🇸
We need to get you to 10million subs, this is way better than any Hollywood action movie, right from the start when you ghost unloaded it to the suicide trail climb. You Rock!
Never saw a vibrating roller used to pull tree stumps, till now!
How thick is the concrete floor in your shop?
You have spent a lot time fighting gravity on this hill and it is not over yet.
That white dodge is looking real banged up
Should've used the bulldozer to pull the smoother up the hill .
Hi Drew , Dozer a path to it and drive it right out ! head down hill towards the driveway . We know you got this dude !
Now the squirrels own it.
Wow, what a moron. The next time try to tow it with your lawn mower, to see if you can do it.
Hey Andrew, just want to say its great that your friends are in the videos. You are a BEAST but having friends help out with projects always makes it worth it.
Be  careful boys,  that roller is not worth dying over
I don't know where the back of the roller leads to, but if you have access to a road behind it, I would cut a few trees out of the way!
Maybe make a new road to the roller than you can drive off the beaten path!!!
You cant make that stuff up.
Yeah that was a little dangerous. You know how to Camarata something is basically a verb at this point - that's the kind of thing people usually expect to happen ;) Multiple large anchor points, not one rotten tree ;) NGL, were it me, because it needs a soft touch I'd be using a hand puller or probably more than one of them. Can't wait to find out what the real answer is :) Also somebody totally put water in there rather than oil intentionally, I'd flush that out completely :s
I understand the desire to make content and possibly “create” situations but WTF! Reminded me of my father moving us up from Long Island in a 1957 Chevy Belair with chains attempting to drive to the end of SilverHollow Road in Willow NY to our 210 acre homestead. We naturally got stuck in over 2 feet of snow. 1962……
Bro @whistlindiesel needs to get on your level.
But did you die?
Y'all are laughing as you're bailing off equipment. You can't get a truck with six wheel drive to the top so why not try a roller??!  Behind a pickup?? No one got killed. Even plan F was very poorly executed. Thankfully an F is all that you got. Dude you guys have to be more careful. Put the whole damn road on hold for the winter before someone gets seriously injured or killed. Because that's where you're at. You're right there. This is absolutely horrifying to watch. And beyond cringy. PLEASE shut the road down for warmer weather. Please. What is the hurry?? Slow down... swallow your egos. It's not funny at all. And it's also not entertaining. It's dangerous. Extremely. Please chill. 💯🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
"runs and operates but no brakes" lmfao bro this is why i will always watch you. straight legend
Maybe a D-11 dozer with winch could pull it out.
And here we have Young ANDREW rocking and rolling all day- sorry, I had to do it..thanks - Ian -Uk
Andrew, look up some recvovery missions videos where they pull-out 40t trucks or tanks and learn from it, or just hire a professional recovery team if you don´t want to buy the neccessary gear like capable cables, rollers etc. Anyways it´s an interesting video again, but stay safe!
Do they make any road rollers with trackes, not wheels/tyres.  For better traction?
We all love watching The AC Way ! The way Andrew does it !
This is by far the best video that you put out. You actually show when things go South, and you do whatever you can to fix it. When the weather is extreme and shuts you down, you are determined to go back later to resolve the issue. Can't wait to see your next video on this.
Had they pulled the lighter BACK END of the roller out from the down hill side that might have worked as the heavy end was at the top of the slope though not for much longer! The amount of mechanicl force needed to overcome  M x G x Sin(theta) to pull that machine up that slope is beyond the equipment in play here. By sheer dumb lucky no one died!
This mountain doesn’t give in
Call Heavy D next time for the rescue
12:19 I can image the repair guy's face after seeing this wonder mess Andrew created!😁😁😁😁😁😁🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would have preferred one of the larger track loaders squash the riding lawn mower. Or a dozer.
I remember back when this was a good channel to watch....now it seems like it´s all about being "cool". Really does not look like what the channel used to be. Dissapointing.
It will be interesting to see how you get the roller out Andrew. Great video as usually keep up the good work
how many disasters have we seen on the mountain road?....  How much damage?....  If only you had road construction equip....
So glad that you have gone from fixing lawnmowers to flattening them. It shows just how far you have come. Even though I am a lawnmower mechanic, all I care about is that you are doing the things that you love to do. Thank you so much Andrew
what a clown show on that recovery
Unhitch the roller and pull the two sections up the hill separately
I always enjoy watching you FIX machinery. These days people are always in so much of a hurry to just replace it and throw out the old. A FEW scary moments there, sure a change of pants was needed,lol. But glad you were all unhurt
Call Mars Mars )))
You can't park there sir.
Another Cruncher ! ' Biscuit !!!!!! ' - Colin furze dixit.
Hi Andrew!  You are really gearing up for road construction now.  I know it is just for yourself at the moment, but if you have all the equipment and you can demonstrate that you can fortify your mountain road, I think you have the experience to bid for road construction in your area as well. Good Luck!
I can't believe I'm passively criticizing you Andrew, but at this point you already know where you F'd up. You made that situation much more worse than it should have been. Slow down! Think it out! Not every radio needs to replaced with a chainsaw.
This is a side of Andrew I have never seen. Him and his buddies playing in the snow and ice on the side of his mountain. Best of LUCK. 44:07
LOL! Runs and operates... no brakes. Foreshadowing.
Jamais déçu avec andrew 😊 J'espère vraiment que tu vas ramener ça sur la route sans casse.
Look ma NO HANDS
Nice to see him with his mates, they all get stuck in as well which is really nice however it was a real FUBAR moment with the roller. Nice that Codie and Blue were keeping an eye on preceding's as well. 🤗
Jesus, not that lawnmowers lucky day. Probably never figured he'd come back as a frisbee.
Looks like a rotator is in order for that one, be careful
Could you  use the old track off skid steer as a raised garden bed, look good full of flowers.
Let's use that big toes are you got it's got a good winch on it back give me more grip underground
I bet that hill was a lot steeper than it looks on camera , too dangerous. Wait for better weather and bigger equipment 😉
Why are you not using the d9 to winch it out?
To say my ass clenched multiple times in this video would be accurate
Maybe chain the front of Skidder to tree and use the winch
i think its time to invest in some big big chains
Have you thought of using the dozer with half inch chain
I think I need my pills again!!!  🙂
On retrospect a pair of new tires for the roller would have given more traction while running over stuff and on the hill.  The skidder is great but doesn't a large bulldozer or tracked-loader bring more grip and strength to the party? Can't wait for the recovery 🙂
Andrew it's time for an electric door opener on the shop
There’s Samantha
Andrew, you really had me laughing! How I enjoy watching you!☺️
That's how you fill in potholes you crush lawnmowers
Amazed they didnt get killed
What a cliffhanger...
That mower has a Flat head engine
Have to be careful near Houses with that !! theylle all be out complain !! Bah Wah Wah !- youve vibrated all my crocks of the shelf !!😆
Superb filming !  Every thing normal  if it could happen it probably wiil ,
How does the camera rod shadow show but not the stick ??
Maybe cut in a short section of road to just behind where the roller is now so it can back up back to the road
I said Roll the Lawn !!!!!!!!!!! Not the fricking Lawn Mower !!😆
GO GET HER BACK!
I'm a retired Project Superintendent with over 40 years of this shiitt. Some of you may know what a Manirowoc 4800 is. We were building a coal mine for Utah Power and Light up in Rangely, Colorado an eon ago. During the winter months the tracks on the 4800 would freeze in the mud that was churned up from the day before. This was a Monday which meant the crane had sat for three days and was frozen in almost a foot of mud. The equipment foreman was there and they had tried everything from pouring diesel on the tracks and lighting them on fire to you name it. Finally the Foreman tells the operator to swing the cab perpendicular to the tracks and try lowering the boom from vertical to about twenty degrees and tickle the boom control. After trying this three times the operator told the foreman it was too dangerous to go any further and got out of the cab. YOU got it, as there was a 30 ton operator that had been dying to run the 4800, so the foreman told him to get in and try it. As the senior quality control engineer on site I could always see and go as i pleased and i watched the whole spectacle unfold from about fifty feet away. The assssbutttt wanltabe operator got in the cab and no sooner touched the boom control when the entire crane tipped over. It was kinda humorous right up till the the cab came crashing back down and the counterweight ripped off the back and went tumbling almost twenty yards into a lunch shack which fortunately was unoccupied. The counterweight had to be every bit of 100,000 lbs. OHHHHH those were the days. Enjoy Andrew, as it looks like you've got another forty years of fun(or not, ha ha hah)in front of you.
Andrew really hates lawnmowers.
That Steel Battery clamp aint the best idea with all the Vibe going on !! if it moves it could short out and have it on fire
Nobody was hurt and this is a miracle. So many things decided too late ...
Won't be any grass growing in that pothole
It’s just gets better 💪🏻 stay safe 👍🏻
That lawn mower broke for no reason
the rubber tires look to have done a better job then the roller itself lol. I love your Weimaraner
Please can you change that other track so they match, then use the old one as a spare . Cheers mate
Sounds Well !!!!!!!
the issue is you need stronger chains hahahahabhahahahahahahaha
What didn't you put the R.O.P.S back on
I love watching your vids Andrew but the doggy's is definitely a plus when there in it love your style it's just simple as hell and I enjoy simple thanks for all your time and effort into YouTube!
👍👍👍
Was I the only one thinking. "You REALLY need a BIG bulldozer to pull that out."?
Sooner or later you're going to hurt somebody really bad or I hope you don't kill somebody
Hi there a dicy moment or two , and a long overdue service , please service the drum/vibratory system it is also likely in very poor fettle
All that crushing should rid Andrew of whatever angst was bothering him. Wish I could unload a bothersome demon or two with such ease.
Asıl ezdiğin o çim biçme makinesini imzalayıp satmalısın , Ankara'dan selamlar✌
Lol those are some patriotic rags!
Should be able to get a much closer cut with that lawmover at 10:45 now.
Wanted to buy - lawnmowers for "demonstration purposes"
You need your D8 dozer with the big winch and then you will get out of there
Should  be able to fill that drum with water to help with compaction...
Even the dogs were looking worried. Scared of what Andrew was doing.
good video
Watching andrew more interesting than watching mr. Beast
Tune in next week kids to see Andrew fix a lawnmower,,that may have been in an accident.
44:30 is the ultimate, oh crap moment...  lol  That could have gone much worse, I thought the skidder was going for a ride too!
Put the mower out on the street with a “Free” sign on it. Ha!
Bulldozer, how much is that bulldozer in the window.  The weight and conditions seem best. D7 with winch on the next video!
Time to build a ROPS for your Roller?
Good way to get a flat front tire! The men ain't n the USA would believe that!
idiot.... keep lettin off the tension and it keeps rollin down the mountain.... watchin dummies play
Path of least resistense.... pull it down towards the road. Cut trees and pull it diagonal down. Easyer....
Hey Andrew I like ur videos . I have a question how come u do to any landscaping jobs at people houses anymore?
Man you had me on the edge of my seat fearing for all of your lives!
Wow Andrew can't wait until the next instalment.
Is that a flat earth mower
Rolling tips from a professional rolled operator.   Shit happens, no I'm joking don't know anything about rolling, but entertaining video as always!
* shake hands with danger start sounding *
Great entertainment 4sure!
I think that's the closest any AC videos has come to real danger. Sheesh kebab.
Dozer up in the woods on the high right side in a dug out and chained to other heavy equipment and trees. Use the dozer winch. Two dozers would be even better so you had one to hold the roller while you reset the chains.
wtf dat small engine hold up for the roller i whought it would do it in small pieces
Some sanguine observations:  1: It's ok to kill or injure yourself, but not ok to kill or injure others. 2: Regarding 1. I guess no harm no foul! 3: THe massive tree root stuffed up the backside of that articulated chain clad machine is a nice touch. 4: 44:42  I saw that coming from a mile away. 5: Great video!
Go to plan B..........calling Ron Pratt !!!.
I have a mower that will get the same treatment soon.  While the roller was at right angles to the road and on the chains I would have started the roller rolling and bailed out. Look forward to your solution.
Maybe make a resin coffee table around that mower.
Why would keep the canopy off ?
going to take that bad boy to the mountain retreat?
...bottom line, he's fortunate,  no, he's damn lucky no one was hurt...luck, just pure luck.
Run your winch line through a snatch block then down to the roller where it goes through another snatch block (hooked to roller) back to dead head the winch line at the first snatch block (first snatch and dead head attached to several trees, not just one), then winch the roller back up on the road....easy peasy
First time I have seen a flat pack lawn mower lol😊
the companion, is it he or she? I just can't guess again.
Like many viewers, I'm always looking forward to your new videos.  One thing about this video that leaves me perplexed.  At 1:12, your camera's boom casts its shadow on the road but I can't see the boom extending from  your hand.  I've noticed this same thing on other videos of yours.  Why?
@Andrew I love watching you content.  I can relate with you trying to get things done on a budget.  Some advise from a guy who's been there.  I spent a few summers on stone and asphalt rollers.  You should always turn off the vibrator when changing directions.  Leaving it on create depressions in the material where the drum is in the one spot while you change directions.  On the Dynapac I operated, you could break the counter balance inside the drum the creates the vibration by not turning off the vibration while changing directions.  The most deaths on road construction equipment is from rollers, where operators try to jump off and get crushed or run over.  Just from the weight alone, and design, there's little control when they start to slide or get knocked out of gear.  You should invest in a ROP and seatbelt to keep the operator in the chair should a rollover occur.  Stay safe young man.
"We are realizing this isn't very much fun anymore"

👋🏻
Absolutely impressed with the shear power of that JD winch on that skidder.All our logging roads up here look just like that,not much room for error.
Several oh shit moments i mean my adrenaline is flowing i can't emagin what each of you guys went through. Wow
As usual - another interesting moment with Andrew...
looked like amature!
You should probably build a short, flat road from where the roller is now to a lower part of the road you want it to be on. It will be a lot easier than trying to pull it straight up that steep slope back onto the road. That's of course assuming you didn't already get it out lol
Well.. At least it doesn't stand in the way of traffic, you could say.. ☺👍
Looks like the easiest way is down. Andrew hold my beer 😎
Water-cooled gearboxes
That was a tense video to watch towards the end. Please stay safe when getting that out next summer.
Andrew use the cat 973 tracked loader to retrieve the roller
Wow, thought you lost that Roller for good...... will be watching to see you get it out, on top of the mountain
There's a kamaratakazi loose on Walton's mountain😱.... At least the new stump removing equipment works fine😁
I guess its true ..  regardless how stupid  you are you'll be scuessfull no matter what aslong as  you keep trying .
I hate to be a keyboard engineer but a bit of advise, i always wrap chains in that situation with black electrical tape. Works like a charm so after its right sided the hook doesn’t slip off and your shit don’t roll away. Love the videos
I miss the days of you against the world so to speak. Now it’s you and a crew of folks who want to be on YouTube.  Sure has changed.  😞 when are you going to start doing large commercial jobs?
Never seen a roller with brakes. Just a forward and reverse lever with your vibe button on top
"SO how exactly did you flip your roller?!" "YES"
Be safe, guys!
No dog can outrun a broken un secure chain.  If one donkey won't hunt go get 10 more👍

Dozer with the winch
Buying or bought?
Always jonesing for your next video, rock and roll, family friendly and educational, thks again for being you.
"I guess I could be steering it..."  absolutely the best!
"Ghostriding" should be on the next batch of merch, lol! Note to self: lawnmowers make remarkably effective wheel chocks!
Just another Academy Award video from the King! I have been following AC for years now and this one is the best for nail biting action!!!!! I can't wait to see the outcome! Thanks Andrew for all you have done for all of your viewers through the years! Take care!
Hey Andrew have you ever thought about buying a bigger truck and trailer to transport your own equipment around so you don't have to hire someone to move them for you
EPIC!!!!
I mean Andrew likes problems.. he sees it as a challenge. Man vs Machine. Snow-free conditions could help.  If not then like I said "Man vs Machine." 🤭Andrews big excavator handles this problem even in icy weather.... 👍🏻
All Andrew needs now is a garbage truck so he can crush everything lol
Why didn't u start it and have it help itself out
That’s what happens living on a mountain nothing goes as planned.
Creating wall art. Sell for thousands!!!!
Can't wait for the outcome!!
Quand on est idiot,on est idiot…on casse tout,fallait aller moins vite avec le remorquage!
Well that was different 😮
That guy you have working for you and running over lawnmowers must be on a low budget
Andrew 🔝🔝🔝💪💪💪
You need one of those rollback trucks. Lol
I kept hoping these childish acts  with the roller would cause the rubber tires to pop.
Buying a new Andrew? Or buying a second roller?
On this episode of "Will it roll"...
Call Thunderbirds, they will know what to do!😄
Put those lawnmowers in rice for a few days.  Then try them out, should be good.
Any other youtuber makes a whole video just of the recovery of the ROller, Andrew does not. He is a jewel in this world of YouTube.
Aren't these meant have water pumped into the roller?
12:58 just your average andrew camerata activities
did you give that dog a choc chip cookie?
Just Cut a road parallel with the one that you're on so you're not trying to pull it up a steep Bank
I am vary cerious why he wants the roller at the top of the mountain. Did he buy to make money? Or for personal use and is going to live up there?
Oh that’s bad, oh that’s way worse hahaha
But did you die seems to be the theme...
Good luck getting the roller out Andrew
I'd put a GPS tracker on that thing, you never know in what county it will stop if it starts moving...
Might be time to bring "THE BIG TOY " ---" THE DOZER " out to join in as the weight of the dozer is more then the roller plus it has a winch on it as well. It will be interesting for sure..
lol
What? Defeated?
A real life cliff hanger
Ends on a cliff hanger …
you must do things like this just for the views 🤣
I lost my breath one time, ...
Time for the Cat !!!! Cheers
Most suspense episode from long time guys 💪💪👍
I think you might want to fire up the D8!
Bei solch einem Wetter so eine Aktion zu starten,ist  "komisch"  u  etwas   idio.......  !!!!😵‍💫🤒🤔😅
Pull downhill?
Andrew- Soewhere, way, way way back in the annals of bad TV, David Letterman ran over a BOWLING BALL with a STEAMROLLER.....  It's time we see that again!  Be THAT guy!   (if not the Bowling ball, a strofoam cooler full of Schaefer's beer.....  I KNOW I am not the only one that remembers this stuff!
Damn what a deal ....But thanks Andrew for the awesome video my friend 👍                                                               Shoe🇺🇸
hahaha, why is smashing stuff so much fun, whistling diesel getting rich on it 😁
Damn, the last part of the video went haywire really fast. Lucky nobody got seriusly injured..
Now you cab offer asphalt paving
That's a lot of water.
11:37 Guggenheim called - they want you to stop stepping on their "art".
Looks like fun ;)
That's a typical no more mowing sign.  ;-)
Can't wait for the recovery.
Sketchy under rated rigging is going to get someone hurt or killed.
Incredible work, incredible power machines, "Mr. Incredible" Andrew Camarata !
You can do it Andrew give it hell!
Lets live on a mountain! It'll be great!
Some days the Equipment wants Blood and takes it. Slow your roll. Heat it up and as it cools it will pop. You've got some Cool Tool's . Start a operator School if you dare. Besides doing good work for good price.
Damn!!
Nothing wrong with driving the roller through those woods to an easier stretch of road to recover on.
Just throw the rubbish in a bin
My guess is the dozer with the winch and the skidder together get it out.
Lets see what we learned today: Things that like to roll, often roll downhill direction. Beautiful mountains. Still avoiding injury/death happily.
Funny how them electrons want to go in a circle.
damn it jim😤
And that’s how you stumble across abandoned equipment in the woods 😆
46:29 Cody has his ribs showing. if he doesn't have an appetite could be some underlying health issue.
If you have never seen one of Andrews videos this would be the one to watch!🚜🚜🚜🚜🚜🚜
ONLY YOU WOULD RUN OVER ODD BALL ITEMS. WE LOVE IT! SAD TO SEE THE RIDINF LAWN MOVER GET  FLATTEN. BUT LOVE IT ANYWAYS.
Great vid Andrew, waiting for the "we will get it out"!!
You and that roller going round and round. He don’t want to go to the top of the mountain 😂
Great interesting vid. Hey question for you , what can you do with old tracks, recycle, or property ground fill ??
Love to see the machinery AC buys and uses. We know that will make the finished surface on all of the mountain gravel roadway(s). Was that the mower that Sam got running a while back? Let the ice thaw and bring the dozer with bigger chains.
Écraser ces machines avec le rouleau compresseur,c’est stupide 🥴👎🏾
your final drive has a better water flow rate than my second bathroom sink
I love the optimism, "At least it's still right side up"
why not add the power of the roller ? i'm sure that would help tons to at at least get it back on the road... no ?
"oh, that's way worse" LMAO
This has to be one of the sketches things I've ever seen you do . Great job though
Feels like a Superhero movie!  Time and time again our heroes do the impossible and WIN Bigly!!! Except this one.  But it isn't over yet. Dumpster Dave is a Treasure and a handy guy to have around when things go Pear-shaped...
I think with the old D7 and big Chains this roller will come out of there without too much trouble you just need a Kamikaze to get on it to help, and that roller doesn't vibrate too much I find.
Gotta spend that Youtube money on something before the government takes it all......Congrats Andrew....Well deserved, well earned
Loss for words
well that was at least $8000 sketchy and funny, so I'd say that roller was a good buy
A little knowledge is sometimes more dangerous than none at all, but at least you knew when to stop 👍🏻
7:44 something incredible. Only Americans can come up with such shit. The two opposing battery poles were connected with a piece of sheet metal, like a short circuit. But when the poles are mounted on the poles, they both almost touch this sheet! Thanks to this short circuit is inevitable! How can you!
Is the surname Camarata of Italian origin?
Lucky someone did not get killed or loose the compactor down the hill
Instead of you trying to pull it up the hill you are going to have to pull it down the hill just to get it back up on the road. Also you may need another machine as a deadman.  You may need to go to a double snatch block instead of a single. Have you thought about making another access road  from the roller going down hill merging into the existing road ?
With three or four more snatch blocks and heavier chain it will come out. Get one (or two) of the dozers to use as an anchor incase it tries to run away again.   It will come up and out and it will be a great vid.
Hi mate.  your not very bright  ey?😉
Эндрю временами распиздяй похлеще наших 😂 В горах зима, внизу лето?
Your Excavator will get it out!
Have you put water in the barrel? I've seen all kinds of material for weight. Ball bearings, Sand, River Rock, on and on.
Moutain 0.5, Roller 1 Andrew 0. But we know for sure this is not an end. Where is the big Cat dozer and its big winch ???
Quite the cliffhanger. That shit was some of the most sketchy shit he’s ever posted.
Well ... ... thats what i call "Camarata-Style" ;)  Thumbs up!
Home Depot (Made in Taiwan) lawn mower ? LoL !
Brake's? I worked for a auction company that had used equipment. Maybe 1 or 2 out of 10 would have brake's. Many a Tree has saved the day from something bad happening.  Good luck and God bless y'all
Once upon a time there was an Andrew Camarata that would have made a whole video out of fixing that lawn mower
Your Dozer and a small link a chain or yank that thing right out of there and wouldn't been screwing around
Time to order best grip studs you will be amazed not like noysy crap chains
D.O.T. must love these videos.
you always prepare your vehicles before a big move, you are smart at what you do, but this time you fu*ked up. glad no one got hurt
Andrew as I watch some of your recent video,s older you get more reckless and dumb you are acting. I hopeyou will reflect on your begining, more money does not mean more common sense or inteligence. The guys arround youn are no help in common sense. God help you.
try using a couple of snatch blocks one at each machine and run the cable through each one it"ll increase your pulling power a larger chain will help too.
that last 10mins was pretty intense!
Holy cow! That was gnarley! Take care!
Drew, meet FLAIR.  FLAIR has lots of money and likes breaking things.  Oh well it's only money and I gotta keep my fans coming back for more.  Drew has great ideas and doesn't like breaking things, but, his things are much cheaper, because they are broken when he buys them.  Diesel Creek is cheap too, but he doesn't do risky things.
Good luck recovering it.
Down goes Frazier! Pulling that roller up the mountain was the best. It had it all, smooth sailing, tipsy turvy, I’m balin’, camera casualties and of course great video work. Even a minor front end bender! Thanks!😅😊
„At least it‘s still right side up“ 😅
I'm surprised you have anything that is actually, kind of new, or actually works!! PS love your channel and thoroughly enjoy watching you and yours...!
Andrew is just Polish guy in USA, in Poland we do work like this every day witch Bottle of beer. good wideo    cheers🍻
Despite those mowers being crushed and broken, they are still more use than Joe Biden!
I live vicariously threw Andrews channel, and I am sure I am not alone. I am also self employed and I find so much inspiration from his work ethic and positive attitude! Thanks for everything Andrew, you deserve to be recognized bro!
I love to watch him break stuff.
Yeah, it’ll buff out 15:02
i see a bad ending coming !!!
All those repairs and service “ oil changes “ wait till you have too go work on the counter weights inside the drum ! Keep your fingers clear of rotating parts ? 🤔 ask me how I know
J'espère qu'il y aura une suite. 🤞
you'd think of all the crap he has he'd invest in a drop in sand/salt spreader for the bed of his truck
Excellent job fixing the Roller Andrew And a little bit of a predicament the rollers in right now I think you need one of your Big bulldozes for Annika
For those viewes who got already scared when watching the roller drive off the trailer unmanned at the beginning: wait until you see the last 10 min of the video. "Safety third..." when you look up the dictionary for "sketchy" you'll find a picture of those guys... wow.
Might need to call Ron Pratt on youtube for this rescue🤣
This video is literally a cliff hanger! Can't wait to see the next episode!
Now, why did I think this was going to go south towing this roller up the mountain with no chains on the vehicles.  And even then you needed a dozer or skidder to get the job done..
Note to self: don't haul heavy things up a mountain in winter
If invited to play with Camarata, you better get your mind right 🙂.
Theses guys seem to create their own problems.
I love that he's teaching her all the tips and tricks of running and fixing equipment but also teaching the fact to always have fun and be safe while doing  it
Lots of pucker moments on Andrew’s videos lately!
Running over a mower that is not working, is one way of dealing with a problem.  I like that idea of then taking the flattened mower to a repair shop.  Would be interesting to see their faces!  As for flattening everything -- well, that is a bit overboard!
I was wondering where I would need to send a condolences card and with who's name on it? Most inept video you have released!
What are the push points for it? Can you take teh skidder up the hill, get the dozer behind it and push while winching, or will the dozer slide off the mountain too? I know the easy way to get it up there, it is called spring, but you got work to do,  that dont help.
Lots more enjoyable where I am sitting. Thanks for taking me along
Keep on Rolling Brother,,
So - you crushed the mower, then the yard tractor. Then at 26:30 you rolled out the skid steer, and I had a moment of panic thinking IT was next!! Phew!!  I agree with others: I think the roller is supposed to drive as well as the wheels.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇲🇦🇲🇦🇺🇸🇺🇸🇲🇦🇲🇦🇺🇸🇺🇸🇲🇦🇲🇦❤❤❤❤❤
That's funny. I watched a video of yours where you resurfacing a driveway 4 years ago. And I thought, he needs a Roller to really finish that job!  Voilá, there it is. For you it might have been 4 years but for me only 3 or 4 days... 😎
Damned
Hello, I follow you from 🇲🇦 Morocco, I love your work, you are amazing, and I always like you
Damned
null😄
Cody and Blue are used to the action...while the roller is sliding down the hill, Cody and Blue are wrestling in the snow.  I bet nothing Andrew does scares them anymore!
Yeah man it's been really interesting
Close call  glad everyone is ok
New standard of quality for roller compacters: how many links does it take to get to the center of a riding mower?
Perhaps use the dozer to cut a new ramp up to the road.  Not too steep, obviously, so a long(ish) ramp, but more important, keep it level.  Use the big dozer to pull the roller, and the skidder winch to apply side load to keep it upright.  Use multiple anchor points in case of another failure, and wait till things have dried out so the ground is harder and the tree roots have a better hold.  Wrap the anchor points as close to the ground as possible to avoid applying leverage to the tree.  Maybe time to invest in a heavy duty Yankum Rope of the size that Zach Millennial Farmer uses.  I'd suggest asking Alan (of Yankum ropes) to sponsor Andrew, but I suspect he wouldn't want to support Andrew's ever more sketchy work practices.  Note how he said 'Time to put on the wheel chains' AFTER the near disaster.  A lot of hill farmers and forestry works are killed by being crushed under rolled equipment they are operating.  Make sure you have at least one person standing back far enough to not get hurt so they can call 911.
Que lio
Beginning of next video…So I bought this Sikorsky S-64 heavy lift Skycrane helicopter.
Don't seem to much luck moving plants machinery to the mountain, always seem to break them.
Admittedly one of the more creative ways I've seen Andrew remove undesirable trees
Andrew is like that old US Army ad for those old enough to remember, "We do more by 6 a.m. than most people do all day".On another note, I think its safe to say that thing will turn you into a real-life Flat Stanley if you get too close.
Love all your videos Andrew but you really need to think about safety when you're doing things driving your big trucks with trailers and big equipment on the back while you've got your drone going with the arm sticking out the window same thing going up in the hills to your other property and now this with that roller someone's going to get seriously hurt or killed and there goes your property or your business hate to see something bad happen
I've always thought you needed a Ground Roller Packer.  Similar to this one but has the big stub's sticking out all around the roller wheel (no clue technical name).  That should bust up the slate pretty good.
Good luck for the recovery 🤞💪
DANGER Will Robinson!
Geez Andrew, what did that poor mower ever do to you? LOL!
Brand new ford needs a new Crome bumper
Thanks!
12:27 is that covered by the warranty?
Where's Blue ?????
Always enjoy watching your videos!!!!!!!!!
So what did everyone else do for fun, today?
How many ton is the roller
Unnecessary lawnmower carnage, gotta love it!
NOW he doesn't like this!
A proper sketchy video to watch.  Andrew you need an Ex army combat engineering tractor. Something around 50 ton with tracks, a bucket and super massive winch  Pack up turn around and go home before someone gets killed or the dogs get injured
I like the flattened push lawn mower, you should hang it on the wall - Wall Art!
like a movie where its the bad guy versus the bad guy my heart sank every time the the chain let go. I thought that thing will go all the way down this time
Make some stuff!! Don’t smash it. Please!!! Love your show 🎉 Fan Sweden 🇸🇪.
On this episode of Gardening with Andrew....
I appreciate the video.
I was chasing a mower for my collection exactly like that one Lol 😆
Maybe more pulleys for more advantage, bigger chains and cables
Years ago, my Dad (after drinking a few brewskies,15?) had stuck the Bobcat halfway over the hill where he was digging. He tried for hours to get it back on the road. I came several days later, assessed the situation (over one beer) and got in, started it up and drove it down the hill and around and ended back on the road further down. He looked at me and stated "Never thought of that!"  I think you need to go with gravity while making your way back to the road. That Skidder is huge! Neat, Thanks
Andrew, be serious, do you have issues? 🙂
When it comes to ice, it pays to stay home.
Wow. 36 minutes into the video and he’s already smashing things. Are we surprised?
Always interesting.   I'm anxious to see the next video.
Call HeavyDSparks, YouTuber!
Wise decision to leave the roller behind and resume it at a better time when it can be done safely.
The things you get into jezz
looks like a vw oil change 23:27
Dog's in the mud underneath. Andrew: "C'mon boy..." Dog: "Fuck you, boss. It's hot out there."
Working load limit of 3/8" chains is about 6600 lbs, which I believe is intended simply to hold the object steady. If your intent is to put significant pulling force on the object I highly recommend either doubling/tripling up chains, or using something with a much higher working load limit. Simply going to a 1/2" chain increases the WLL to 11,300 lbs. The snatch blocks are good, double up if you need to, leverage is great for this sort of thing. With enough snatch blocks you can pull a tree out of the ground with a pickup truck.   Lastly, I am not familiar with rollers, but why not use it to help push itself out of the situation?

AC - Buying alot of larger, heavy equipment. All for you or are you expanding your biz. services? Just curious...
you're gonna need a bigger boat!
Yup, the bigger the machines, the bigger the danger. No surprise your Dad didnt want you involved in Heavy Plant. Don't worry after watching this, you will wreck yourself.
The YouTube Channel “Ron Pratt” might help you out regarding getting the roller back on the road.
You guys got lucky. Too much cowboy going on. Get the dozer and excavator and push in a decent road before you either lose the roller or get hurt. Get behind and push with the dozer and excavator so you have a safety catch. Don't hook anything to it that you don't want to roll down the mountain with it. I love an AC video just as much as the next person, but I don't want to see anyone get killed trying to do it. Not trying to be safety Sally here, but I have been in a couple sticky situations with equipment like this and know what can happen. I learned that lesson many years ago. Be careful.
This is the funniest video you have made 😂😂
When are you ever gonna put a garage door opener on that thing your killing me!! Lol
I enjoy your  ideas but ruining something. That's something a 10 year old would do. Or two 10 year olds. Just ridiculous
a new pathway to create to get it!
44:43 'i don't like this ' don't like this ' 😂I'm sure no-one would either like to be in the driver seat🤣😜
Even mustie couldn't get that mower running now.
Back in my Marine Corps days we use to do the same thing, but with tanks and cars.
You are disrespecting that lawn mower...why??? I do not like to see things destroyed for no reason
Is there anybody in that group got any sense just a little would help
nice m8, break a legg with the roller
A new business: Blasting, all kind of demolitions and sinking construction machinery in the woods.
They use steel brake lines, 'cos they're cheap, like a budgie''
Looking forward to seeing you get the roller out of that spot.  Hope its more fun.  Might wanna wait till spring.  I know you would rather be riding your sled, me too.
One thing about you Andrew you don’t mess around do you haha can’t wait for next vlog 👍
AWESOME !!!!!
Holy cow! That was close. LOL!
"Ran when parked!"
‘So, tell me again how your pets got sliced in half by a steel cable..’
...so, you gonna run Judge Doom over with that thing or not?
That was getting to the point of a risk of getting hurt😳 When you having to jump off machinery while it's out of control is a recipe for disaster. Be safe 🙏
When Andrew mentioned that it was a hot day, I thought: aha, first clip is already half a year old. But noooo, it is already one and a half years old :-)  Andrew must have a huge pile of clips from which he is working off.... Maybe meanwhile he has built a paved two lane road up to his mountain refugium and finished a second castle up there :-)
I think you got to maintain your road little better
Now get someting heavyer like D7 and winch  or a D9 .
"Safety Third"- Mike Rowe
How anyone didn't die on this one is beyond me! Luck of the Dutch and Irish i guess!  I  bet you couldn't have drove a ten penny nail in that man's Ass that was hanging on for dear life on that Roller going up that icy road! 😆😂
" Hell, even Noo York  State empire builders get bored "
if like the wizard of oz
At least they can laugh about it!
Just a tip Andrew. Never vibrate the drum when the machine is stationary. It hammers the bearings in the vibrator housings on one area. I worked for Galion many years ago. All the best.
It appears that we are seeing your destructive side today Andrew!!!
Why is there no one on the roller just a question ,other wise well done
Video  👍   Trying to climb an ice covered trail  👎
Man   or    women/??????????????????????????????????
" Camarata has lorst his mind, he started filling pot holes with lawn mowers "
“At least its still right side up”
Might be easier to disassemble. Detach the roller, pull the two parts out and reassemble.
$8k for that was an amazing deal.  Wish I could find one for that.  I'm glad the roller stayed right side up.  Had my doubts for a minute.  Plus even I had high sphincter tone when it started pulling the skidder over the edge.  Did you have to change your shorts?  Look forward to part 2.
Hi Andrew, wy dont you call Matt´s offroad recovery service?  they will get it out  Sorry, best regards from Germany, Thomas
Nobody told me I needed a fix steer to fix a skid steer!
you need loggers chains the big ones that dont break
This is a not what to do video.
Hello.andrew
16:37 a pot fire? 🌿
Great Video Andrew.  Good luck on getting her out.  Loved what you did with the lawn mowers.  Next time you wanta try it again may I send up my  ex wife? (only kidding.lol)
Good way to get someone killed of badly hurt wow!!
Use your dozer, it's a lot heavier than the skidder, to pull the roller back on the road.
36:20 Ouch! Sketchy - Maybe put a big pile of logs behind the roller so it doesn't go any further downhill, and wait for a dry spell? And/or build a new road below/to it!
If you are angry, take this machine and get your frustrations out lol
Wow....the excitement doesn't stop!
So glad no one was injured
Very interesting video, Thanks for sharing. Looking forward how you get the roller out!
Best comedy show on u tube. No brains.
I would get rid of that battery hold down. Just  looking at it makes me cringe!  Solid steel to short across terminals.
Ice.... It's changes everything! Be careful, be smart! More snatch blocks double, up the cable. Tie the skidder to a big tree. Good luck!
seen that coming, havent laughed that much in years thanks andrew, that was classic!!!!!!
Well that looked fun!! Wish I had the money and time to come and help!!
Man just got it really going and now its stuck on the side of a mountain :0
How many people can say their driveway is paved with lawn mowers?
Was questioning Why the skidder wasn't anchored? Or using a second snatch block and another Heavy vehicle or two
Thats the best F^*ked up video I've ever seen, Awesome footage as ever Andrew, Love it
Thank goodness everyone is alright... 🙂
why do they have a tensioning system where you need to refill it? as opposed ot a mechanical system.
That got really hairy at the end. You nearly knocked yourself out with the rollcage following the big tug. You put a lot of money on those 3/8 chains too, shockloading them with a runaway roller while it was still hooked to the free spooling winch. That scene had lots of eerie signs about it ... glad you walked away from it Andrew.
It's not fun if it's easy.
USA NJ the trail Builder
DUDE!!!!.... As much as I enjoy your videos.. I am glad you are not in the rescue business..
Wear I work we ran old rollers for years and the best units were the old bomags they seemed like you couldn't kill them
You’re going to have to change some of these titles. Maybe something like “Destroying stuff with my new roller” 😂
Needs more pulleys 👍
Will it crush!!!
oh shit never mind
USA NJ great by hope it works great HANS
Good thing you took the canopy off for emergency exits!! LOL
Hydraulic oil?
Mower enters the shot...I literally giggled like a kid. Hahaha
Looking forward to see a motor grader as well.
14:00 did you guys watch Stephen King's Christine a few too many times? :D
Does your Ford dump truck have the 6.6 or the 7.8 liter engine?
Поздравляю с приобретением. Супер! Берегите себя.
words from an old rigger, use gravity and pull that roller downhill not uphill
Oh and another thing, you seem to want to use that winch for as power out also,, find one for it.
I feel like that one lawnmower steer tire deserves to live on after surviving that onslaught!! Like on another piece of equipment. 🤣
Always interesting.  Great show. ✅🇺🇸
Oh man... can't wait for the next installment with the roller back on the straight and narrow! Stronger chains, maybe?
Hi Andrew ❤❤❤❤❤
go get the seven and make a path then use weight of seven and winch. Got to have weight. Love the show!!!!!!
Yikes that was sketchy even for AC. I am glad you decide to let the roller sit until the ice thaws.  Mother nature was fighting back hard on this one.
Had me fooled. I didn,t realize you had it in gear as it was coming off the trailer. :) WOW. The end was more exciting than the beginning. CAMRATA, never disappoints. STAY SAFE.
Um???? How come it wasn’t running when you were tugging it. & in gear/w someone driving. The safety officer said no when he seen it going up the golden road. Don’t wreck that fuchker that was a brilliant find well besides the five gal ov water “wow” man gees. I laughed the whole time…. Lawnmower pizza was cool that’s for shur. Yup,,, I said that’s going to be bad newZ
Hang one of those mowers on the wall! Lol
No lawnmowers were harmed in the making of this video...oh wait...😛
Wtf remove the ROPS ?????
1/2" chain  & dig ramp onto "road", select good deadman!!
Hmmm…well, I guess I would have thought by now that Andrew would have known to NOT take shortcuts when hauling/towing stuff up his mountain road.  Very thankful someone didn’t lose their life or get seriously injured because of poor judgment!
Best thing too say almost bid ! That grade all will hurt your feelings
do you ever think about what the dog would say ( OH SHIT  Dad bought a new toy whats he gonna do now OH BOY - yep im his doggo
thats some sketchy stuff....I'm glad no one got hurt...
Lots of interesting comments.  Andrew:  Have ever wondered why you try to move very heavy equipment up the hill during wet or icy weather???  I can see chaining the skidder and dozer to geather to get the roller out.  I'm sure you have retrieved it by now.
This reminds me a time when we had a roller at our shop.  After fixing it,  we immediately started crushing sh*t.  Nothing as big as a riding mower tho!! LOL
They should make them hollow so you can fill them up with water
Dig out a sloping road from the roller gradually down to the road up your property , and It could also be used as a passing place 😀.
I thought I was the only one smart enough to have a flatbed for their rolloff truck. I haven't seen anyone around me with one.  So glad everyone survived. I almost needed a new undergarment when the skidder started to go over the hill. I can't imagine how you felt.   Understatement of the year......  "We're starting to think this isn't fun anymore."
At the Mower reparations shop. Something's wrong with this mower, i think it's the carburetor
No Roll Over Protection structure. Winging it when you know better will KILL YOU or somebody else. GET SMART or GET SUED SAFETY FIRST
why didn''t he take the big dozer, he might have done it
YIKES!!! Been there :-/  about  40 years ago. I quit  moving Heavy equipment  after November.  We had a Crusher in the ditch. I said No more
Hahahahahahaha they have it chained to a sapling hahahahahahaha
lol
drugs are bad m'kay lol
Do wheelie!
go and get the big dozer and the 977, chain, lots of chain...
That ice was no joke. great video, glad nobody was hurt. Looking forward to the next video.
Not to be a stick in the mud but my stomach turned a bit when i saw you pulling that roller without a cab, or even rollover protection up an icey mountain. that could have gone waaay worse.
Great video, waiting for the next one for sure. My guess another piece of equipment will be hooked up with the skidder to pull this off.
I could have fixed that mower for you,,,Well pre rolled
Tuck and roll bro. Glad your buddy didn’t die on the roller.
42:16 Parallel Parking 101 or How to Install a Garden Feature.
Already two moments on this video where he feels being mortal :) is Andrew getting old?
D7 time.
How to clear the land of trees, up by the roots,  quick and easy. Good video Andrew.
butt pucker factor 10
Great video.  Andrew, don't keep us hanging.  Drop the video of rescuing the roller as soon as it's done.  Want to see you beat gravity and the hill.
who was that wearing the portland air freight shirt
Thanks DB nice to get a reply other than a troll. One of these day ill do a total recap of all the videos. 😝 when I retire.
What about that magnificent PANTHER BODY!
Thank you  ,  Andrew  .
Maximum sketchy shit.
Good luck on getting the roller up the mountain. Dang.
this is the antithesis of clickbait. The most thrilling content on youtube, but hidden behind a rather mondane titel at the end of a video. This is for the conisseurs. Cheers Andrew
aww, you finally got new barrel of grease ,was convinced that thing was going to go on forever  😁
Landscaping at its best
Is Cody okay? Looks like he's lost a lot of weight
Awesome episode, im guessing its bulldozer time in the next video.
get a decent size pulley!!! that thing is for 4x4's!!!  this fucks up your winch cable.
I am looking at some 4 ton mini excavators. Which brand do you recommend. I am buying used.
Andrew has always been a little reckless! 😂
Another good way to fill a pothole,  throw a lawnmower in it ! ! LOL 😆
That stuff is suppose to be yard art not driveway art
Andrew... you live on a mountain of shale... your new mountaintop is on a mountain of shale. You crush it with the crusher or the roller it turns into dust while you are watching it. And the dust turns into mud as soon as it rains. You need tho put real rock on your roads... not this bad stuff!
what happened to the skid steer roller attachment?
woah now
Woohoo new video
This man is gonna buy earth eventually lol
lets hook up to a rotten stump of a tree. nice rigging job at the end. bidens brother
Who's needs a rock crusher when you can throw a lawnmower in a pot hole.
fun &games!  why not use one of your D7 s great content god bless &stay safe!
Just an FYI, chocolate is toxic for dogs, so make sure cookies don't have that....  Grapes/raisins as well.
omg! ive been a long time subscriber and watched you do some pretty stupid and unsafe things but this video is hands down the worst, you almost got somebody killed!
Damn!  Lmao  At 22:10 !   Once you open the other bolt !  That's holding the air!.   It Just gushed right out !  Lol  damn though
I hate to say it but you're going to have to grow up someday
The dog looks skinny..
you need to use the dozer as an anchor
only Andrew could use a roller as a monster truck. I laughed so hard, great stuff man!
Always a must-watch moment whenever Andrew gets a new machine!
What's on fire?  (no one seems concerned lol )
Thanks Andrew for sharing.    Take care, and all the best. 🇺🇸🗽🌊⛴
Watching the guy jump from the roller was scary. Note to self: steel pretty much slides on any surface if not level.
Now roll over the dump truck!!! Lol . Cool video
Matt's off road recovery would get that out with two harbor freight winches and a jeep.. 🤣 jk.
Towing Troubles would be a good name for this channel. Cheers
😂😂😂🤣Another toy!  Boy that mountain keeps fighting! Andrew will conquer like he always does!
Just curious but can the roller be filled with water for added weight?  Don't know if it would be enough to really make a difference though.  I imagine anything would be beneficial.
looks like a job for the dozer
It becomes a statue
Needs the shake hands with danger soundtrack.
Now that's truly living on the edge! Awesome video!
Andrew ice and steel never mix
Some days it pays better to stay home.
Too late now but I think my first pull would have been from the other end, the motor end.  It puts the drive wheels back on solid ground and it's downhill.  Once the tires are down you could have used them to help pull.  But as usual Andrew will figure out a way to get it done, one way or another.
Instead of taping the drive, you should have been driving the vehicle
LOL!!!
Your dog check it out and said yeah that'll work
Videos always good for a laugh
Опасная у вас работа ребята. Удачи.
Don't quit your day job and take up off road recovery. Hinesight is great but pull down hill next time instead of up hill. Enjoyed the show. Thank you.
Not fun for Andrew and crew but lots of fun on this end. Good luck, I'll be tuning in next time.
TIM from Canada Time do use your bulldozer use both of your bulldozer and your log skitter together your bulldozer should have more power with that winch on the back icy roads in the back country not very good
something bigger and with tracks will work
Take a picture of the lawn mower and have an artist make a painting for one of those modern art picture galleries!
Yeah you put little work in that it'll come in handy
maybe get a strap for those trees, thowing chain around them is going to kill them and you kinda need them all right now
If you need a fresh machined head and rebuilt injectors and fuel pump let me know I have them the block is junk though btw that's a really hard to come by rare ih engine now can't find anything for them now
Now your talking my language.. I live sleep and die by the roller unfortunately.. for 8 grand  you stoll that thing 🤣
Watching you roll over lawnmowers does nothing for me. I’d rather see things working real work.
Ive said and some other people have said i think before..............................................you need to buy one of them big big big helicopters so you can airlift stuff out.
Never a dull moment with Andrew    parked in the ditch it must be done as well
Will you be getting new tires and check roller to see if it is still filled with basalt it doesn't look like it when it's vibrating and going over stones and rocks.
send the compacted lawnmower to Mustie1 in NH and  he'll make a V ideo  "will it run".....!
There'sa  pot hole fix just throw a lawn mower in it  hahaha I hate rollers and hills.  That was bitchin man always havin fun!!
Dude the iron bar across both battery terminals though ? Wtf
Dude your driving a skidder , you should have driven the skidder straight up over the hill then wedged it Infront of a large tree to anchor the skidder then winched the roller up to the road , once on the road you can then reposition the skidder back down on the road rehook the roller to the skidder and tow up the hill , it surprises me with all the heavy equipment you own that you don't have at least 100'  of 5/8 chain on hand for these types of situations .
well parked, noone will steal it.
I'm just waiting for Andrew to say it wasn't dangerous.
The fastest roller ever pulled uphill. I'm sad it got slightly stuck for no reason........
The D7 will bring er outa there! Lol 👌
Not having fun anymore was initiated by pickup pulling a roller. Talk about snowball effect like a roller lol.
Glad your friend has more sense than you & jumped off, this has to be the sketchiest video you've shared with us to date. Maybe you need to put a roll bar /cage on everything you own. Double yikes.
Damn !!!!!  Can't wait till the next installment.
wow the cringe levels. surprised you didnt try pull the roller backwards onto the road (at around 40 mins). would have been easier since its down hill instead of up but then she slid further and i thought "too late" lol. entertaining but deadly
13:40 Christine (Plymouth Fury) getting crushed by a bulldozer.
I really liked this vid!
Wonder what the compression is on that riding lawn mower now ??
Who needs a trash truck when you can take your garbage toss it in a hole and run it over with a roller . PS if you have any free lawn equipment any size bring it to the castle Andrew's has future plans for it !!! Andrew I would like to bid or buy on a signed piece of one of those flattened fine lawnmowers .....
Sometimes that's how things roll
Is this video pre Blue ?
Da, the roller is a biotch when it slides.. My dad worked for a construction company and they had it slide down the slope, but it was steeper than yours, also it was heading towards a cliff of 61 meters free fall. Then he arranged two loaded trucks, one up the road, one down and an ex to help. They succeeded and saved the situation. Rollers have little side grip, especially on the rocky and icey surface.. It's fun to crush stuff, but take care on what you do, since fun can fast change in serious troubles. I hope you save it in the next attempt. Cheers.😎
try a cat pulling sideways as skid pulls up hill ??????
Why didn't you drive it up with the  skid er  running that was to much weigh for it to pull get some balls lol
My mom would say  "He has alot of growing up to do"     at 14:44
Andrew! You need a responsible adult with you!!!
aww man what a cliff-hanger😅
that got sketchy real fast 😮hope you got it recovered safely.
Mustie1 could fix that mower
Tim from Canada this is what happens when you go fast on the ice you go off ROADI G
What track do you like on your TL 10 after putting on the new one compared To the other side which track pattern do you like better?
using under rated chains , scary as hell boys .
What an influencer there Cam, I just sent the wife to the store to pick up a Digiorno pizza for lunch.
Any The Rock crushing pigs feet roller
Sorry - here goes---"Reeeevvvengeeeee"   (FCWanda)
A dozer will slide sideways off that ice also. Seen dad do it. 🍿
Great job Andrew (not). Another good example of a  "bad example". Play stupid games and win stupid prizes. Ever think about maybe picking up the phone and asking someone who  knows how to run a new piece of  equipment, maybe someone with years of experience, just for the hell of it before you go out and attempt to kill or mame yourself or damage it  beyond repair?
That's a clean looking Ford Crown Victoria in the background.
That could have ended up in the next county! Thankfully the trees held it!
Andrew, you could sell that mower as a puzzle.😉
Glad it did not go down the hill more. Love watching the dogs having fun. Keep it up and stay safe.
give the lawnmower to mustie1 i bet he gets it up and running again lol
I haven't laughed out loud so many times in a row!
Andrew buys equipment and destroys it before using it properly and almost dies.....?
Best battery tester made. The new electronic/calculate loads are crap. Good Ole Resistance.
Use your D9 instead, it has thicker wire and more weight.  Secure in the front too..
Makes you think if that mountain wanted an ornament on the side of it... As for the safety keyboards: Safety Rule 1) Stop tapping on the keyboard.
''I guess I could be steering it '' - that has to be your next tshirt!
So danger.
Holly Roller that was close 😄
Andrew keeps rolling with the punch's!!!!!
You know, I think that Andrew might just be like some of us regular folk !! He jumped when the sparks flew off the starter connections. Still knows a lot more than me though. But, that, I don’t mind !!
it's hydrostatic, who needs brakes ? oh yeah you live on a mountain... maybe you should have brakes
I think the  chain you're using always to small, and what about the roll-cage, safety first. you don't want to kill any of your friends. LOL
One more thing. Cholesterol medication, statins, cause age related symptoms also. Arthritis, joint pain, tendentious, muscle cramps and pain.
Those ribs on those post pliers are to clean inside the battery cable ends, great job flushing out that watered-down oil WATCH THE THREE STOOGES AT THEIR BEST
TARYL FIXES ALL COULD WORK ON IT.
I think the cap will protect it better you should put it back on that's why it's in good shape you got it and wrecked it why.???
Hey Andrew Have you though of Branching out, If so You have Heavy Rescue Down Patt. no Job Too small, No job to Large. Have Chains will travel. LOL
Winch dozer to the rescue.
I think we all need to admire the strength of root system of that last tree.. 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
That was pretty scary.  Glad nobody got hurt.
weight pulls weight
Someone needs to get Andrew a matt off road recovery rope lol
Thanks for the cliffhanger.... on the edge of my seat here 👍
When are you gonna fix the D7?
Diesel Creek would be envious over that roller he got a junk one for twice the money you made out on that deal.
Another great video Andrew! Man, when you went for the roller, you took me back to my old road and parking lot days working for an asphalt contractor. It was tough in the Northeast - sunup to sundown from April to November but I don't have a bad memory as the tanned skinny laborer that could put down a lot of food and never gain a pound. I drove a roller similar to this one, along with dozers and dumps but also swung pickaxes, sledges, pounded in pins, shoveled and excavated. Never did much equipment repairs but maintenance was part of the job. On the debacle with the skidder and roller hi-siding off the road - you're not the only one with the problem. When that happened to us we actually had to cut a road/pathway like an offramp in a gradual grade and towed out that way. Best to leave stoning like your environment for the summer.
all that lawn mower needs is  a little oil. it should crank right up. 🤣
Adamant not going, it’s hot. Hahaha come on
YOU'RE PULLING IT UP THE HILL WHEN YOU SHOULD BE PULLING IT DOWN THE HILL
You should dig a hole at the tube and make the ditch deeper.
muito bom seus vídeos camarata, estou aqui do Brasil, São Paulo te acompanhando, parabéns pelo seu conteúdo.
it won't start...............can you fix it......
podran habilitar los subtitulos en español
I wonder why all my stuff brakes
Lmao... It wouldn't be a "proper" video without some sort of Destruction
Don't ever let your insurance agent hear you say  "ignorable fire!"
36:35 “watch this watch this watch this watch this dam” HAHAHA
Awesome Toys - for the Big Boys!
I'd get your old cat dozer with the wench...hard to do anything on ice though
I didn't realize we needed a "can it crush a riding mower" test.  But now, I am going to need to see the crushing abilities of all your other equipment in video form.  lmfao.
This is like the jokers show
Do you flush those at all when you find all that muck in there? ATF/diesel would work great. Is that a new way to pull stumps? Straighten the roller out and chain it so it won't roll farther down.
i was scared for you all watching that
Just get the Dozer.
That was a nail-biter! You might have to rent a Chinook!
Dozer with the unstoppable winch? Maybe have to wait until not so icy to move the dozer.
So many handshakes with Mr. danger.
Andrew, catch the bigger rocks with the edge of the roller to shatter them.
So i have a question. When you where trying to pull it out would not have made sense to have someone attempt drive it as your pulling it and or had some one hold the breaks ro reposition your self.
I think I'd use your biggest dozer/ trackloader, and a much bigger chain
Rock n Roll hahahaah
Try chaining the skidder blade to a tree. This way skidder won't slide back, as long as the chain and tree holds. Then run your line out from the skidder. As long as the cable winch has the power it should work.
8:10 you’re supposed to turn the cable clamp into plate oval hole to lower the likelyhood of shorting the pole to ground. That’s very sketchy way to clamp a battery. Lukily it’s so thick steel to stand the +600A current when it happens so machine will lit up elsewhere or explode the battery :)
Let’s see how this roller does. Hmmm. Let’s rollover a cpl of mowers to break it in.
Can't believe it ended like that I hope the next part comes out soon
If you had watched the adventures on this road you might not have thought you could pull that roller up the mountain with a half ton pickup    If you get killed will Youtube  make an announcement  or will your videos just stop?
Andrew has a eye for deals. Hey maybe grind up old tires and spread them it help pave the road , government funding to deal the tires and you got a paved road. The mow , you could have filled the divot in the lawn , what were you thinking !? Wall art . who thinks they are big enough to tell Andrew , "that is not a toy and not made to crush things with "  well any one ? Got to like Andrews Grand exits  Stay safe guys good luck.
Why are you destroying a lawn mower? Give it to a needy person they could use it. Think of other people, not just yourself... I just unsubscribed from your channel.
Major puckering
If you have ever wondered why you come across rotten old machinery deep in the woods in the middle of nowhere and ask yourself "how in the hell did that get here?"............. This. Who woulda thunk something with as little grip as a Roller with bald drive tires couldn't drive up a mountain? Lol. Looking forward to see how you get this out. I'm guessing all the chains and winches, at least one tracked excavator, the Skidder and a bunch of sheaves/pulleys to gear down the winch and increase mechanical advantage? It'll be slow and take lots of resets, but it's probably the only way.
Hi You need 3/4 chain that is rated for lifting, you need at least 3 preferably 5 twelve inch diameter pulleys that are for more than one inch cable And when pulling you need several trees tethered to a pulley with chains that do not run trough when one tree fails With enough cable and pulleys you can pull to two or more directions with one winch cable at the same time
Nothing like driving on a public highway giving the road your full attention...(NOT)
Andrew your scared me, I'm thinking you can put another road in from the road your at a less steep incline to pull her out .be careful love your vids.
Don't be an idiot.
Whenever goes up the mountain in winter time is always entertaining
Need the dozer winch and skidder winch together my friend! They should pull it up with ease Andrew, good luck brother! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🤙🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸
Best video so far. Looks like you may have to make a new road from the roller gradually back up to the road.
First I was thinking why is he not getting better tires for that thing. Now I am thinking maybe that was a good thing, I mean if it rolls down that hill.
You need a semi
🔥🔥🔥👍😆
close call with the roller... they are unforgiving,
this is definitely not a video on how to fix a lawn mower.
You are having too much fun, just too much fun with that roller. I would have salvaged the wheels off that riding lawnmower. With your inginuity you would figure out a way to use them .Thanks for the video. Jon
What could possibly go wrong?
that is indeed like that
Nice to see you back to doing video's you used to do.
Sooo, you hate cutting grass!
You can't leave it there... What if someone steals it! ? 🤣
Holy bat shit Robin!
Andrew , do you need to replace sprocket when you replace with new track.  why do you choose the track pattern you have and where do you shop for quality and value for product
You are going to come unstuck with your hap hazard dumbfuck ideas of working with heavy equipment. At least put your fookin dogs out of harms way, as one of them if not both are going to suffer at some point!!
Entertaining to say the least.
What happened to her long hair
ragazzi, non prendete esempio da questi......ogni tanto gli succede di incastrarsi da qualche parte, o come oggi, che qualche mezzo gli si sfrena e gli prende via......come diceva mio nonno........guarda che la tua mamma non ti partorisce di nuovo........cavolo, ha la ruspa cingolata con il varicello, perché non e andato giù con quella?????? poi sono troppo spericolati,  in questi casi le cose vanno fatte con calma e bene.......a parte che trainare un mezzo con trasmissione idraulica, spento, si fa tirare il triplo......se non la accendi e fai girare le ruote, anche se hanno pochissima aderenza, ma aiuta tantissimo........questi credevano di tirarla su da spenta..........se guardate il video, nel momento in qui la tirano su, le ruote dietro girano, il rullo anteriore resta bloccato....... ripeto, ragazzi fate le cose con calma, se vedete che e pericoloso, aspettate, chiamate aiuto, e sopratutto, non lasciate mai il mezzo in discesa in quel modo........magari sterzate, fate appoggiare una ruota contro un ceppo......o contro la terra dal lato superiore......non vi fidate mai del freno......questi oggi gli e andata bene......metti nel momento che il rullo gli ha preso via, qualcuno era dietro il fuoristrada, o dietro il rullo....magari che faceva Pipì, ecco pronto il funerale...........
Bald tires + no rollbars + winter + hills + + + = fail  but we get to learn, so thanks for not editing
Hope this ends better than season 8 of game of thrones
Why the hell didn't you just use a dozer to recover the roller?
Use a couple of your heavy dozers it may work
Shit you guys are sketchy
lawn mower conversion for mowing into rock cresvests lol
Funniest episode ever!!!
YANKUM FAT STRAPS!!!!!
Get a dozer down behind the roller and help assist it up the hill while pulling with the skidder
This is exactly what I need for my driveway!
Am I the only guy thinking to add that big dozer with the winch?
Time traveling, Andew?  Does not look like January in NY.
More thought is needed or just more brute force.
Whistlin' Andrew at it again
Always interesting to watch  … a real cliff hanger at times had me at the edge of my seat … (no pun intended)  That sinking feeling … I’m sure was felt by all … Just a personal observation but looks like you need a bull dozer now (or anything with great weight and tracks) to figure this all out or to be your anchor if nothing else for the logging winch … kind of the one - two punch required “maybe” … Great content Thank You
I can't believe the battery strap that's on that thing.  An accident waiting to happen!
oh my......
I don't understand what's so funny.That they create this situation what did they expect to hapend get this roller up there with no problems in winter?Sometimes it's better to think before acting stupid
Andrew could you make a leaf grill/trap over that culvert?? Nice to see Dave giving you plenty of help there 👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧
I guess those mowers will take up less space in scap pile 👌
10:00 The Rolling -Stones- Lawnmower part of the video was very funny, usual Camaratantics...would've been disappointed had he not rolled something flat!
Time to bring the big iron 💪 out.
Heavy equipment repairs. My favorite kind of AC content❤
Too bad you live too far from @tarylfixesall. This would be an awesome skit.
Andrew Danger, the vehicle recovery channel
With the title I thought this was another diesel creek video😂 both my favorite YouTubers like buying rollers lol
2 year video. This guy is way organized I would’ve lost all that footage. He’s the only YouTuber I watch that makes a video that sometimes takes this long or a lot longer I’ve seen before. I love this channel. I would love to meet Andrew!
You should send it to Taryl fixes all, tell him you have a challenge for him
oh my god that was a great upload, thanks, makes Sparks motors stuff look like lego recoverys. ✊
Dam it, Camarata I need that engine; 😂
This lawnmower means nothing to me.
Ok. So I guess I like squish video's.
LMAZZOFF! FLATTEN THAT LAWN MOWER!   ..... HOLY CRAP ! you need 2 rigs to pull that bad boy!
real prepper work 😂👍👌Nice 👌👌👌
Dang that went side ways
2:48 into the video and Andrew has already coined another classic one liner😂 I’m just gonna ghost ride it…. Followed up by… I guess I could be steering it🤷‍♂️
well ,, one thing is forsure youre parents didnt raise no scared kids . cant wait for the follow up on this  doozy'!!
In the next vid..........Andrew buys a new roller, a bigger one!!!  ✌️😁
I was yelling "MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE, USE IT"at my monitor.
Přemku to je hovado co? 😂🤣🙂👏👏👏👍
I stopped at 23 seconds to say "Yes" a fix it video.
no way in this world I would let you do anything on my property no way! I would rather a blind man do my construction work!
Of all the Camarata things that could happen, this was the most Camarata. I anticipated the dialog at one point to include "Well, it IS a roller after all."
Pretty hairy situation. Looking forward to the sequal.
Never, ever stand anywhere near a cable or chain that is under tension. We lost two workers this summer to snapping cables.
Think I would have pulled the other end up first then staying behind it snatched roller up  , then helped push him up the hill . Ever notice cat always push scapers not pull them , there's a reason for that!! Sorry no thumbs up on this one .
May need you big dozer and the cat 973 loader to push and pull the roller up the mountain heck you may need 2 big dozer to pull it. Man y'all be safe out there. Have a great day be safe
Like a scary cartoon, a "steam roller" with no brakes.
Pull downhill
If you are an old piece of equipment or vehicle and Andrew just bought you, one of two things will happen. He will fix you up and use you as intended, or he will smash you the f* up with the chance of being thrown off a hill.
i would say the log skidder is your most important machine
And I bet that lawn mower place would say "Bring it to Andrew Camarata and ask him to reverse a roller over it. :)
@Andrew Camarata I dont see the problem, you can use the big D7 dozer, it got a winch, awesome work on the road by the way  also you could profile the drumm with hardface welds for some grip
aaa  I just love this channel ,,,, Team work !!  Keeping it reall!1Cheers!1;-)!1  lol!!
Cool 😎
ANDREW, Happy new year, new toy, new fit session, and...Beware the trees...I'm waiting for the next video...
OMG!  I'm looking forward to the next installment!
The new youtube trend: crushing things with a roller.
Can't wait to see how you get out of this mess.
Why, why are you using chains. Straps have so much more strength.
Do you do any jobs anymore besides your own?
Andrew with his personal tomboy in action.
You are bloody mentall
That was one of your craziest videos ever! Glad no one got hurt. I bet the cat bulldozer with the winch get it back on the road. I knew it would be a battle to get the roller to the top of the mountain! Good luck
LMFHO Andrew wow never a dull moment in your vlogs 🙈🙈🙉🙉🙊🙊🤔🤔🙏🙏👏👏😎😎😂😂🤣🤣🎉🎉✨✨🎆🎆🥤🥤🍻🍻sit back and watch the party ☘☘you must Irish roots cos you got a lot of luck in your movement of machines🚙🚙🚛🚛🚜🚜🛵🛵🚤🚤💞💞
I needed a laugh.  I bought $50,000 worth of Party City stock.  It then fell in price and they said they were going to file bankruptcy. The SEC halted trading.  Today it's selling for about 13 cents a share, so my investment is worth around $7,000 and falling. So there goes $50k out the window.  I chose poorly.
Time for the D 6
Adding more blocks of pullys will multiply your pull force. As well as serious (pounding in spikes into your wedging) of the back tires of your skid steer to make it stay when pulling. It can happen.
That ending is a real cliff hanger, get it 😅
inventive way to pull trees lol
Good stuff 🏁 shake hands with danger 😂😂
Fixing potholes with Andrew.  Step one: Apply lawnmower to pothole
I really love all your videos but I m afraid that you will get hurt one day doing all this. Please, be carefull because we all care about you !
Did you cut a ramp down to it and drive it out?   I know little about this but was concerned that there was no rollover protection as it was loaded on transporter.  A bit sketchy  No harm no foul?
Every machine that sits outside takes on water sooner or later
objective interrupted by gravitational mayhem,,maybe the spirits of those two lawnmowers had something to do do with it..excelent show ...
👍👍👀
Always entertaining..
i don't understand why he did not take the big dozer to pull it.
Surprised you didn't bitch about how cheaply the push mower was made after watching your video after watching the video of you bitching about your truck not being able to withstand impacts
Was expecting a Nantucket Sleigh-ride at the end there.  Glad no body and no pups were hurt.  Could've been much worse.  Can't wait to see the extraction.
Always  put a metal  coffee can on exhaust  pipe
Kept wanting Andrew to say those mowers were broken for no reason at all! :)
No brakes must be a requirement for Andrew to buy a piece of equipment.
Clearly You have never truely grown up ,just a big kid with  even bigger toys lol Getting quite a bit of good iron.
Andrew's version of Roller Derby.
41:43 "At least it's still right side up!"
eposodic season cliff hanger. Be sure to tune in next time...
What are those two incompetents?
Le montage pour les chenilles a revoir il faut commencer par le barbotin et finir par la roue folle tu auras plus facile à monter la chenille voilà mon garçon
Dozer time with the winch
Still waiting for the video "buying and fixing a Zamboni" lol
Them rollers are like salt, they just make everything better.
I appear to be the only descending vote but I enjoyed the channel much more before you went weird!
Another day in the life of our AC. Initial evaluation:  AC tested, AC approved. Briggs & Stratton, not so much. It’s not officially added to the fleet till it proves it can paddywhack a mower till it becomes part of the driveway. ✅. As for the icy mountain road saga, I was screaming don’t try it without a set of tire chains on that roller drum. The extraction will make good content but I’m sure we both wish it hadn’t come to this. As much as we love wild and crazy AC antics, that moment has passed. Please be safe and sensible till she’s back on the road. 🥸👍✅
Holy shit. I've done some sketchy shit before but that roller situation is something else.
The roller has to be running and in drive  to get it out.  You are just dragging dead weight.  You also need the dozer to use as an anchor.
I wonder if mustie1 could repair that flattened mower? And be careful you don't want to pop a hole in that drum it might go flat
This video was freaking fantastic. From crushing mowers to several people almost dying multiple times. Awesome 😂
How drunk are you guys when this stuff happens?
Roller makes nice yard art.
*"And that kids is why there's a roller on the side of Grandpa's road!"*
Beautiful drone shots.
Forget pulling!  You have all the equipment and stone that you need to cut in a little road and drive it out.
Can't wait for next video, getting it unstuck
A minute of 8 lb sledge hammer action on the big rock slabs would dramatically improve the finished product with the roller
8000.00 to crush lawn mowers lmao he is too funny
44.34 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Guess you didn't have enough chain (1/2") to spool out the Skidder Winch and chain the front of the Skidder to a large (non rotten) tree?
I've seen this man do some sketchy stuff before but this takes the cake!  🤯😬❗️
Isn't your dozer up on that hill. The one with the huge winch ??
It would have helped so much if someone would have got on the roller and drove it when it turned parallel to the hill while he pulled it. It would have been a little dangerous but with it pulling itself aswell as being pulled that would have cut down on the danger factor just a tiny bit I think. Everyone that wants to freak and tell me how wrong I am think about this, I have done this same type work Andrew does for going on 15 years now so I know a little bit about how these machines work and the dangers of being around them on a daily basis. If I'd have been there I would have for sure got on it and drove it while he pulled it once it turned parallel to the hill.
20:01 "alright, that's how that looks..."  ima ded 😹
Anchor the tractor. way up the road to a good tree and then just use the winch to pull it up. be care ful and stay safe........Peace.
Where is that D7.? You guys sure like to mess around. It’s a wonder that nobody got hurt or killed
gotta love the way the dogs just look at him like - WTF is he doing now 🙄😂
This is almost reaching AYO fishing levels of predictability.
I would have titled this video, ‘putting my new roller in winter storage.’ 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ glad it didn’t end any worse…
Wow, I nearly had a heart attack when it let loose, and the skidder started following it almost down the slope, and I bet the washing machine was on high-temp to remove any stains that evening. 🤔😧 This lad Camarata will do anything for content. 😁
Best video yet
Why don’t you use the winch on the dozer?
You definitely need a DPF filter on this roller. Especialy if you operate it in your garage/living room.
Hello from wet California , Andrew, your dogs are so active, have they ever been injured by any of the equipment ? Great videos Thank you
Wile E. Coyote's lawn mower lol.
And he wonders why things break for no reason. Thanks for sharing.
I must admit, without the roof the roller looks better. XD Well, maybe adding some roll-over protection that has a roof. Whould look better and protect you.  And heck, Andrew should really get a truck like Dave! That thing is SO useful its incredible!  But DAMN! That momend when the roller slid backwards it was just creepy! Just like some other moments there. Glad that nothing more happened. And the Skidder is once again the most versatile vehicle on the mountain. XD
I just reran your 1 Year on the mountain video and your right you do need a better roller. Cheers. Best of luck
In the beginning it looked like the hydraulic drive on the roller wheel wasn't working. Looks great now.
andrew looks like its cat time. lol
I like boys but I still want the clam relationship
Nice roller but kinda hard on lawnmowers
Wee rolling we go!
You have enough equipment to build the new New York interstate  And when you die you will have enough stuff too be the winner hopefully many years away
Now ready for part two.
Holy cow…!   Is your roller driver ok..?    That was a near miss on a grand scale…, scared the hell out of me…   I don’t think that roller is coming out till after the spring thaw.., and that might be a good thing. Great video, Thank you sir.
Future Andrew Camarata' museum is waiting for you))
Sheesh, my butt pucker muscles were cramping there at the end.
Recommend a ropes/roll bar be installed. Enjoying the channel. Tks for sharing.
Childish running over the mower😡
Pothole-Fix 2.0: Just stuff a mower in it..
Time to bring the tracked  equipment I and heaver chain.
On this episode. Andrew will show u how to fix a pot hile with a lawnmower.
YES! haha love it what's work without fun idk I think the rollers no match for the bulldozer as for carnage but still make great wall art 👍
Somebody is going to get hurt.
Directed by Wile E. Coyote ? Pro tip : Never hook to any tree you do not want on top of you or whatever equipment you are towing /  towing with  . Another pro tip : Point the skidder DOWNHILL and use gravity as much as possible  instead of having to fight it with both pieces of equipment . You might need the excavator now , but , probably be a good idea to wait until most of that ice is gone .  That's enough fuckery for one day without trying to play on the ice with tracked equipment , lol . Never a dull moment .
Think you might need the D7 to get that out...
You're the king of entertainment, Andrew! Keep up the great work. 👍👍from Canada.
...Beep beep! Wyle E. Lawnmower...
36:14 that was scary
I guess I could be steering it... Meh. 🤣
Interesting video , stay safe folks
That D7/8 will rescue the Roller no problem.
This is the most funniest video I've seen thischeer have a good one Andrew hope you get it out
your idea of safety blows my mind. one day your going to kill some one
Oh fok, very Big problem 😮😮😮😮😮
Guess Andrew will be getting a "new" used 75 ton rotator for his next toy.
Now that was some good footage. Like every one of your videos. Glad no one got hurt. The Governor
Bring the 977 down
Andrew is just Raw the real deal, just my cup of tea, ik like him and his effortless workflow!
Don't know if its pure stupidity or determination of getting roller up mountain top. 🤔
WOW!
Wow, that ending escalated quickly
Ice , gravity and heavy equipment where going to need a bigger boat !
And then it broke for no reason :)
Thanks for bringing us along for the ride, glad nobody got hurt.  Kinda hard to work on the roads when the roads are fighting back.
12:01... " And an estimate is..."...😁🤑...
That small enclosed black trailer that I have seen at your place for a long time. Is that a travel trailer or some type of specialty trailer?
That was sketchy! Need stronger chains, and the big dozer, or big track loader, or the big excavator. At least stuff like this makes good content as long as no one gets hurt or killed.
a couple 5/8 chains and 3 or 4 snatch blocks and you can pull just about anything
safety is not first on that hill....
Plant Hire machinery is very expensive, so 8K for that roller was quite a bargain! Andrew puts down some nice driveways, it'll be ideal by rolling them even nicer!
I guess single flares okay for offroad.
"Hi! Troy Poulan? Yes, your lawn tractor and push mower are done. You can come pick them up anytime. Oh, and you may want to bring a ridiculously large cartoon spatula. Yes, spatula. You're welcome."   😂
Hello Mr. Camarata, do you have courses in the area of ​​mechanics, hydraulics, bodywork, painting... anyway all these maintenance that are presented on your channel??? They're so good, I love watching them!! You and the girl (daughter? or wife??) are to be congratulated!!!
And this is why we can't have nice things.
Cool
You need thicker chains and a Habegger Cable Hoists. They're worth their weight in gold for this type of work.
Start up the doozers...
So I’m laughing at the ride on lawn mower scene and that scene in Austin Powers came into my mind and it somehow made everything funnier.
Note to self:  Always bring stronger chains.  Lots of stronger chains ---- especially when the job at hand is trying to get a very heavy machine up an icy, steep road.  Funny thing about that tho --- Andrew always seemed to do ok by himself, but with a bunch of 'buddies' egging the job on when it was time to stop and reconnoiter, things seemed to go ----- downhill.....  Anyways,  always a great show!!!
AC not at all thrilled with the crushed lawnmower! But, I mostly enjoy your channel.
Hope you get the roller out soon before the weather gets even worse. You and your friends have tried very hard to get it unstuck down the ravine I just hope you guys can do it
dozer with winch will do it!!!
I'm noticing the title of this video....'Buying a roller' kind of over simplifies the real subject matter.  How about renaming it... 'buying and repairing a roller then doing some sketchy recovery s***'.  LOL  Glad you guys are safe.  This one had some shocking moments.
Haven’t you heard of the new water-lubricated drives? 😂 22:00
Just why?
Ya glue that lawnmower together somehow and you got Andrews wall art. Somone with more money than brains would probably buy it for thousands of dollars. 😊
Andrew U Killing Me to make me wait your video
44:47 First time I think I've ever heard Andrew utter that phrase😆
это начало новой санной трассы с горы !🎿🎿🦽🦽🤣🤣
And I thought how exciting could a roller video be ? Knowing Andrew just watch and see. And Andrew delivered again 😄
sketchy, sketchier, Camarata :)
Amazing video !
I bet you Andrew gets that lawn mower working again.
Could you not have waited till you had six feet of snow and then tried to get it to the top of the mountain???????????
That could've been $8,000.00 down the drain.
Add a dozer in front of the slider.
You should do a Heavy D collaboration and he will probably send up a ex military heavy recovery truck 🤣
The push mower left me shocked, the rider left me shook. Lol
That job will require a case of beer and a dozer to anchor that skidder!  Sketchy redneck stuff, I like it!
be careful man. we love you
Just go ahead and made it Andrew you want a car crusher really really bad.
Is the roller without power at this time?
Best entertainment that I had in a long time  lol
Best of luck!
Thanks for your vid 😇💟💟💟 Love us all.
You should have brought your big toes are down there to begin with you just pulled it out instead of trying to do the skitter phone the Skidders to light it was pretty obvious it wasn't thought out very well was it
How is it legal to be filming while driving? Dot just don’t care? Police don’t care? Strange.
I like the way you were able to render a lawnmower from 3D to 2D.
"..oh that's wayyy worse.." 🤣🤣
Isn't that redundant? That lawnmower was _already_ a flathead!!  🤣
Curly, Larry and Moe at their finest........
Well. Dont know what you were thinking but that was never gona work. Always do everything to prevent something going wrong. Chains ? Pffff who even uses those....
That moment when the roller & skidder both make a break for it & start sliding down the mountain & Andrew gets off & casually says “i don’t like this”  I swear i nearly wet myself !
ТРИ ДЕБИЛА-ЭТО СИЛА!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Excellent
What did he achieve by destroying  perfectly  rebuildable  machines?
Why didn't somebody have some balls and be in that and drive it as it's being pulled
😱😱😱 2) I say that it would definitely be a miracle if all involved guys will become 40 years old (at least if they don't change their typical behaviour).
Hi Andrew, Just wondering, why did you wait until winter to move it to the mountain? I think it you went to get the dozer to anchor the skidder, you would have it on the road. Stay safe.
That was absolutely insane wow!
id use those snatch block to get some mechanical advantages
Andrew I know you want to get a job done but please be careful and fix it if you can  And I have seen you  fix most of your equipment .
The wires in the wire clamp right above the started arched at 8:30 like there was a wire that had the coating rubbed off and was touching metal. It's the clamp with several wires that's hooked to the sheet metal side panel. He found the bare wire a 15:58.
Дурная голова , ногам покоя не даёт, зато весело , удачи
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👍👍👍👍
WE DO NOT SELL METAL PASSATS FOR THOSE LOADERS
2023, the year Andrew gets someone killed?
People will be confused when they come up your driveway and see all of the potholes filled with old appliances and mowers.. lol
Now that's a cliff hanger
This video is a perfect example why you have 1.2M subs
Who else hits the "like" button as soon as one of AC videos shows up in subs?  LOL
I ate like you do and it caught up with me. All the stiffness and soreness and joint pain I thought was age related. Nope. It was sugar, processed foods, high carb diet, seed oils that were causing it. If you get to that point and you think its age. Change your diet to nutrient dense real food and in 90 days all that crap will be gone. I am in better shape today than I was at 60. Maybe 55. Im 68 and I take no aspirin or any pain or inflammation drugs. Just HBP 1/2 tab a day. That's it. I was on 7 prescriptions in 2018 for what I thought was getting old stuff. Doctors will never talk about diet. I wanted to tell you. Just in case.
K can anybody tell me if this is a new video or a year old one. When he changed the air filter he dated 1/23 so if its 1/23/2022 and not 1/23/2023 did he and his girlfriend get back together. Because a while back I had mentioned that I hadn't seen her in a while. Some troll answered me that they had separated and bashed me for not watching. Well not everybody can sit in front of a computer all day long. I work I am on the road 10 months out of a year. How about that trolls. I dont have every day to watch vlogs. Im sure you spend most of your time watching porn. So If somebody could let me know it would be very much appreciated before I go back on the road if they got back together. No Im not a truck drive. Please no trolls giving stupid statements.
Keep safe dude.
Wonder how many sponsors Andrew has turned down? (Not that it's a bad thing)
"it's water from a restaurant, you could drink that" 😂😂
When Andrew is doing LSD you never know what you’re gonna get! LOL
At least he kept a positive attitude when something bad happened ( I didn't want to ruin what happened to anyone)
This was a fantastic literal cliff hanger ending. Can't wait to see how you get it out.
Hey Andrew If I was on the steamroller when that rolled off the road I would have to use your shower Then your washing machine and dryer.
Looks like you may have to build a road down to it.?  Can't wait for next video!
It's on fire....."Figured is was an ignorable fire" - Andrew Camarata
Certainly got my attention wow very very butt clenching rather you than me lol great content
This is getting interesting
That tree was junk anyway.
Living life dangerously plenty of excitement.
Andrew the more I watch you the more dangerous you get...you need to be more careful man video content isn't worth someone's life.
I was glad to see you stop and admit it was time to leave it for another day, mainly because of the slippery conditions and that it was getting very sketchy like you said.. If I was there I would have suggested having your D7 dozer with the winch on there as well, even if you just used it as an anchor while you reset the cable on the skidder...
The Rolling Stones song “Under my thumb” comes to mind when seeing it squish the mower.
Need a big dozer with a winch for that, calling it now
Please open subtitle  greek
I think Andrew wins the kid with the coolest toys on the block
Next epsode ... cut a new road to the roller probably esier than pulling it up
What the hell is with all the water in the gear boxes/hubs?? Wow.
Samantha: Whats for breakfast Andrew?  Andrew: How about push mower pancakes?
andrew those battery terminals are ether very close or touching the steal hold down band that is grounded.
I think that d7 would be better pulling that
Вы с такими темпами скоро асфальт положите там
Andrew I like your videos but you are really stupid trying to pull that up that hill in the winter. If the guy would have got killed that was driving that machine your ass would be grass getting sued big time. Not to mention having to live with that the rest of your life knowing you did something really stupid got somebody killed
That's like caught between a rock and a hard spot ,I know you'll get it out with some Bigger chains and better anchor points .
Put the mower at the curb. [FREE WON'T  START]
Yikes!!!
Looks like you picked the wrong push mower to mess with!
The dog is hot in the middle of January, when was this filmed
Letsdig18 and dirt perfect eat your heart out LOL. You know you guys always wanted to do this since the first time you seen Coyote on Roadrunner ran over by a steamroller
Never a dull moment on the mountain
Awesome. Andrew is bringing “sketchy” back and violating engineered limits everywhere. Love the content.
It might be better to drive  the roller up backwards while pulling it with the truck .
Parking brakes are overrated
To be continued...
That battery hold down in a joke!
So all that maintenance To wind up being Yard Art?  I feel so unresolved
You needed the weight of the dozer not the skidder
I think you need the D7 to pull that out.
18:05 to make the next guy's life hell, why would anyone use steel brake lines for any other reason? It's because a specific group of rich douchebags are allowed to control the copper market creating artificial scarcity to rise the price. That's why. We have enough copper floating about to build a fleet to rival that of a small country, making the boats entirely out of copper. And that's just copper floating about, in junk yards, sitting about etc. You'd think that ever since the last time we had artificial manipulation, we'd stop allowing it. Nope. We're still letting them do as they please.
dog and pony show.someone is gonna get killed if you carry on like this
Ну вы даёте🥹🥹
Is she the lady from the  E-BAY auto commercial? You know the one Harley then Aquacar then “lets ride!”
"no brakes.  This is so sketchy.  I'm gonna ghost ride it"   🤣
Doesn't the dozer have a winch on it ??
Abandoning the roller was a great decision. Don’t throw effort after foolishness.
The dogs know when to shift out the way!
Except lawnmowers
This is the first time I've ever seen Andrew leave something stuck! (at least until the next video..)
Podes traducir al español ....
Be careful good luck
Sorry ..aber Idiotisch mit den Rasenmäher!!
Better wheeled down, than we’ll up……and everybody safe and sound.. time to build a road now
You are scary, enjoy
Every time I see a new video posted I get exited . ANDREW is the best yter in my book
Complete chaos there towards the end lol
WHUUT !!! WHAT A TEASER FOR PART 2 OF THE ROLLER ENDEVORS 👍YOU GOT ME SITTING ON NEDELS 😀 AND IM NOT THERE
Andrews name must be on a national list of car rental agencies, "Do Not Rent to This Man!"
you where crushing it
The damage to those mowers seemed fairly minor. Should buff out.
" I guess I could be steering it" 🤣
Oddly enough, i woke today wondering what a road roller would do to a mini tractor.
Shit happens...  Hang tough and work safe Brother.
You could start a whole new YouTube channel.  Crushing with Camarata and just run over shit with the roller.  ;o)
You pushed too close to the limits on this one. That thing is just a big toboggan.
You should of known that the mountain was slippery it ice  up be more careful than that equipment can be replaced people cannot take care
Time to bring the dozers with some 1 inch chains
30k vues in 1 hr  that's great
sh/t happends
great way to start off my day off
The battery hold down bracket is ...."sketchy"... to be polite ! I would NOT use this model.😐😑
Why fight gravity by pulling it up the road? When one could have tried pulling it down the road?
that last 15 minutes of the video was a movie
Labs......one bite.............two bites........GONZO
That was some serious reckless shit. Happy to see no one died or got maimed.
how stupid you are some times is just fun
I am thinking you damn near had it! If it was running and you idle self drove it while the skidder was pulling it would have come up!  maybe? probably at this point digging a new road over to it at its leave would work!
Nothing like a cliffhanger to end the video! 😁 Like you said, at least it’s still upright.
When that thing about jerked you and the skidder down the hill I about crapped myself so I’m sure you probably needed to change the ole drawers. Crazy.
Looks like quite the adventure Andrew.  I'd be using the skidder and your D9 with the winch cable. Roller won't be pulling bot irves down the hill.
That was a bit of on the edge of the seat! I can't wait for part two!!
Wouldn’t be a roller video without a lawnmower getting destroyed
Whew, best and craziest video yet.  Can't wait for the next one to see how Andrew and his team gets the roller out.  I like Andrews comment, "At least its upright".  But I will bet he is able to do it.
Hello
20:01 "alright, that's how that looks" 😂😭
That's either a D361 or D407 IH engine.
At least it can't be stolen.
For goodness sake put the ROPs back on before you kill yourself or someone else.
Some yankum ropes would be a good tool for your collection
Imagine how much monet he would have if he stopped buying stuff. He a junk collector.
Holy crap!
No rock is safe when Andrew is around
The only things to survive the Nuclear holocaust will be Cher, Keith Richards, and Briggs & Stratton !
todays lesson... dont try to drive a roller up a mountain in winter ..lol great vid!!
Never ever boring 😂😳😓😲💪👍
That video deserves the best YouTube entertainment award! That was dangerous but awesome!
Andrew Camarata  - A brilliant man with 🎱🎱 of steel!
Gee Wizz so much fun
You need to build a new road to get the roller out 😂🙆
Andrew, being Andrew
A classic episode
YIKES!
I'm very surprised Andrew didn't anchor the skid when winching?
You are the best, but fix the roads as you know the problems, it must be easier in summer time or
Best channel on YouTube is at it again!
I noticed it's slide show not movie, no 60 fps?
Never a dull moment AC. Couple of close calls. Be careful man. Who’s gonna entertain us if you’re gone? Sorry I’m being selfish from my warm dry recliner.
Parte 2
It's shaking the ground like it needs a sticky bomb. Lol
Would be curious to see how a roller like that would perform if you replaced the flat roller by one with nubs.
42:28 The lab inspectors dont look that confident with that operation. But what choice is there when all the good winch/ pulley point rip out one after the other? :)
I was gritting my teeth watching those small chains the entire time.  I've seen them break under much less stress.  Glad you guys are ok!  Can you drive it down into the woods and hook up with a road?
It isn’t speed over the roadway, it’s consistency of vibration that crushes the rock,er, object of intention. Go slower, Sam!
по распиздяйству Вы переплюнули даже Российских дорожников )))) техника безопасности прежде всего !!!
Maybe drag the roller going downhill rather trying to bring it up hill.  Use gravity as a tool.  Chainsaw out a path.
41:44 Always the positive outlook "at least it is still right side up"
WAS IT DELIVERY , OR WAS IT DIGIORNO.
Andrew. We can clearly see you have a hatred for lawn maintenance and anything associated with lawn maintenance. And I love it!!
Dig a ramp at a shallower angle up & along the hill?
watching that fiasco with the stuck roller is like watching the movie Fargo all over again: It just gets worse and worse! Respect, Mr Camarata for taking the time to film this - it must have been a huge additional PITA!
Sliding backward on an icy slope is a very intense event.
Hay why don't you just get the dozer with the winch line on it. That dozer seems like nothing can stop it and I'd would just back down to it and hook up to the dozer and winch it up a Lil bit to get the roller off the ground and pull it up the hill with you .This was a great video and it was fun till you said that you figured it out and its not no fun no more. Hopefully you can get it out with out it ending on its top
Little does past Andrew know, future andrew will have a rock crusher 6:41
Man, at what point is it easier to just build another road from where the roller is to where you need it than try to get it up to the road you have?
"All right that's how this looks" 😂
"Well Ollie, this is another fine mess you've gotten us into  .  .  .  "  More pucker factor on an icy road.
Wouldn't the bulldozer been a better option !!! Just saying. LOL
Now that's what I call a cliff hanger of a show :)
Yep, buy a roller....start smashing old mowers. LOL. Classic Andrew. Is there a car in there somewhere?
What’s happening wae the rock crusher?
Truthfully you need to pull it up the side of the hill facing towards the down side of the road. And try again . Damn you guys are freaking me out. Someone's going to get hurt ! Try my suggestion. Please 🙏👍
انت عبقري وفنان انت بصمه
Cripes, lol
Justin had a close one!  maybe fit that roll cage back on.   go0nna need the big dozers winch for that i guess.   great footage tho!
Why take the roof off? Height limitations? 🤷‍♂️
What’s the story with that old cub cadet in the background at 27:51
Thanks for crushing the lawnmower 😅😂😂😂
Just use the dozers that would be better to use
You guys getting that roller up the mountain is by far the best content I've ever seen anywhere!! love it! Andrew you're the best dude!
Looks dangerous as hell. Looking forward to the next one!
Never new you could use a roller to create modern art!?
Fun
Cut trees and pull it downhill.
Can't wait for the recovery video haha
That got pretty SCARY at the end!! I thought both machines were going down hill 🫣 You guys need to slow down and think things through a bit !!
I swore I saw the live leak watermark on this video
WHAT are you going to do with all this equipment Andrew.
Man that was sqeaky butt time, need to go to the john.
One of the most exciting videos you have ever made Andrew!! I was holding my breath many times!
Fiiiinaaly
get the yellow cat
12:17 See if MUSTIE1 can fix it!! lol
It's not fun anymore? When is it fun? When someone gets killed?
I do believe that lawnmower will fit in a no 3 fedex box😂
Take that lawnmower to Benton, Arkansas and find Karl Childers.
Well, if nothing else, you figured out a new way to remove trees!
I guess no tribute to a dead friend at the end of the vid is a good sign. Yeesh!
That roller is wanting to be woods art
*insert Rollin by Limp Bizkit
Did the man fix the mower?
Hi Andrew. You need more than one big snatch-block. Hook one to the tree and one to the roller. then run the cable through the block attached to the tree, down to the one attached to the roller, then back up to the tree.
Put the skidder up the hill and chain the front to a tree. Winch away.
Vitro tro Porto  ✌👍😎🐕🇵🇹👑🇺🇸🤳
Slick drum and slick tires on ice. You were not thinking when you decided to go up the mointain. Glad no body got hurt.
That roller is wanting to be woods art
I would think the big dozer would have been a better choice to recover the roller then the tree hauler.
Way to end the video on a "cliff hanger" :)
jesus what a thriller, almost turned blue
Rolling over stuff once, maybe twice is ok but what Andrew is doing is playing with it. Edit: after watching to the end 'interesting' is an understatement.
skidder doesnt have enough weight  does your caterpillar not have a winch also
It was just getting good for it to end like that.  Cody and Blue what do you think about that?
I don’t know why this is so funny to me, but whem Samantha and Andrew run over that mower was hilarious 😂 Andrew has the most fun running over and crushing stuff with heavy equipment 😄👍
Limp Bizkit style
Never a dull moment with Andrew. Its not the first time the mountain fought back. Good luck.
You could cascade enough pulleys and you will be able to drag it up, no problem. Just as long as the chain and steel wire holds and you don't just rip out your anchoring points. But with cascaded pulleys you can take the advantage of multiple trees to share the load, the chains will also share the load depending on how you cascade the pulleys.
Prob gonna need to use the dozer with the winch
11:00 The lawn mower broke for no reason 😉 like someone else said " Excellent job not dying on this one "
The BIG doozer with the winch should move it as it has the weight and grip to hold it
Wasp, not a bee
What happened to the speed ratchets, why are you not using them?    Getting new rubber on the roller anytime soon? Can't Wait to see the next roller video !!!!!!!!!!!
skip to 36:20
not trying to be that guy but you knew it was the same spot as before with the ice . maybe different timing
You need a HD snatchblock
Enjoyed video. Thanks. Glad nobody got hurt.
дизлайк и разочерование. технику уничтожать...
My only problem is the dogs being in the middle of all of this.
Only Andrew can "hump" a riding mower, with a vibratory roller
“I don’t like this”. I don’t either!  Hehe. That looked very scary. Glad everyone is alright.  Did you figure out or have any theories on how so much water got inside the diff? At least I think that was the diff.
Andrews invitations always suggests to tuck and roll.
From Roller to Moauntain Ornament
What do you do about tires on this big equipment? They’re pretty worn when you buy used it seems. Have you replaced any of these huge tires? Cost?
39:30 well that aged me a bit more!
is cody okay? he is looking like he has lost weight. hope he is. 46:29
Best rescue video ever.  Better than tow truck rescue.
starting to get worried about Andrew
Empty the roll, then use your excavator to make the slope that it’s stuck on more level and pull at a 45.
Who is the girl that is helping him fix stuff?
Love U!
Nemokat
I'm sure if you got the D7 and the Koehring that far down the road, they could get that thing out of the tree easily.
"who needs a rock crusher..." Well you, of course! Lol
awesome
Andrew did EXACTLY what I and every man child would do after buying a roller…smash everything in sight!
Yall need a skidder operator 🤣🤣🤣🤣we take skidders up and down mountains way worse then that go up the hill and put it against a giant tree and then use chokers to grab the roller pull it back up it will be a real problem but you can get it the ice is real problem but the skidder can deal with it
A cliff HANGER for sure.
So, I guess there are potholes and lawnmower holes!  Ha Ha
part2 ????
That was one of your best videos and very entertaining to say the least. Can’t wait for part-2
Who'd a thought you would need rollover protection for vibratory roller?
Need more pullies and I am glad that nobody got hurt!!
great drone shots going down the road to the mountain place
Sorry that happened... I jumped out of my seat at the point both vehicals slipped.  I really like the way you end your videos with the drone getting the arial view.
A lot of angels on your side!
3/8 Chain?  Really?  Wow - I would of thought it would require much larger.  Give us a talk about chain size during one of your next videos,  This was great Andrew.
Dozer in front pulling the log skidder maybe that's enough to get it back on the road. That roller weighs a lot and the fact the roller is not turning while pulling it makes it worse. Too much resistance.
Andrew, you teach us in a beautiful and special way how to solve complex things in a pleasant and humane way.  Thank you Love from Israel
Y'all SHOULDA just got your track loader out and cut a new road to run that roller out with, altho you should have just got it or your dozer to pull it with in the first place.  I knew [and you SHOULD have] that there was no way that dinky little log skidder was gunna do the job, it lacked the weight and the traction, even if it had the power.  By the time this is aired you may done have it out of there, but if not, MY advice is to come up from below it some, and find a spot you can break over, and cut a new trail to drive it out going down hill and while you are on the way down to get it, shave all that darned the ice off your road so you don't have such a suicide slide going on to deal with.  If it had been ME and MY equipment, 1, I would have never even been out there in that kinda weather, but 2, if I had no choice in the matter, I would have chained up the truck and just drove to the top of the hill and got a tracked machine to use.  There's no way you'da caught me trying to pull a 6 or 7 ton piece of equipment with a little pickup like that!
Wow two gigantic dozers with two gigantic winches 5/8 1-in chain snatch blocks easy peasy
during winter i really look forward to these looks back to summer to see what Andrew was doing
That certainly took a twist
Andrew always makes it interesting!
Definitely got my ab work out from all the "oh shit!!" jump reactions, haha! Im excited to see how you got it out!
I would say if you had a way to chalk the wheels as you pulled it up and reset the pulleys, you could move the skidder to better ground and get that beast up on the road
You messed that right up
Was that digiorno's?
Андрев привет ну ты молодец, и кузнец и жнец и на всей техники ездец✋😉🤩
Couldve use that lawn mower seat for the ol roller ... wouldve been best to use it before you smashed it but im sure itll still work
I bought a Bomag with blade on front Deutz engine. Smooth drum will not climb hills and slide sideways if vibration is on going up a hill. Try to go down hill when compacting. I have sheep's foot drum .  Front and rear Power drive also. Nice channel 👍
I  can say one thing andrew is struggling to day
Holy hell that's a scary day what a pain in the ass.
Good deal. I needed this break to change my underwear.
I would have been singing my theme song on this one, “I’m off to do some sketchy shit do dah, I hope I get away with it, all the do dah day”  and hoping I wore my brown pants that day 😂
Camarata lawn mower service..  We will straighten out any problem..  We flatout have the best prices in town...
Who needs a rock crusher when you have a roller
That gradall would be nice
every video you break something up😂😂😂😂 I LOVE IT Very entertaining channel
Last few minutes, pure anxiety watching those tiny chains strain.
I was waiting on the ending to be, well got the roller to it’s winter storage spot
Andrew does this roller use an IH motor?
πάλι χωρίς υπότιτλοι👇👇
Time to call in Matt's off-road rescue
I hope you put the translation property of the clip????????
*ghost rides thee whip *   - the whip :
🤣Я давно, так, не смеялся! 👍 Ну хохмачи!!!
Now al he needs is a road grader
Man that battery hold down worries me    Looke like being on a massive vibrating machine it would make contact....    and it def looks like steel..
16:42 New Andrew quote to put on a t-shirt: - "Uhm.. It looks like an ignorable fire."
I say get the roller out with the D7 w/winch!
At least it’s still upright is the best statement of the entire video.
Need to get you one of those big ol dirty twin steer 8x8 western star flatbeds
Everytime there is something new that can chrush something, theirs allways a lawnmower under it.
Lawnmower karma 😂😂
You might be better off using a sheep's foot roller in the vibratory mode to brake up the larger flat rock !!
pretty sure ur just hoarding stuff u dont even need because you've already got it
With all this equipment kicking around, you're gonna need to hire an on-call mechanic 😆
A day at the amusement park
⭐🙂👍
Andrew and his merry men and Lady.😉
Rolling tips from a professional roller operator.   1. Only use vibe going up hill. It you use vibe on a steep downhill you will start sliding and loose control.    2. Sweet spot for compaction is 12 strikes (vibes) per linear foot. 3. If you do loose control immediately turn the vibe off. Also you got the roller so cheap because the drum is not driving like it's supposed to.
Be Careful..... No second chances if that rolls over you or the dog.
Enjoyed the video Andrew
This video brings back memories of when I first come across Andrew's channel all them years ago, when this is all him and his friends did was destroy different things.
After seeing the lawnmower segment it reminded me to click the thumbs up button!😊
Excellent job not dying on this one. Keep up the good work 👍
send them mowers to mustie 1 he will get em going if he thinks he is going to make a buck or 2
HiYa AC, Just wondering if a automatic roll up door opener with remote in the castle would make a great addition?
If Andrew ever opens a restaurant, don't drink the water.
Oops
I think we first saw this in the video of the 0turn mower.? Good to see the video on it.
When you buy your grease by the barrel, you’re in deep.  Not as deep as that roller ended up. A real cliff-hanger!
Hey Andrew love your videos. God has blessed you so much. Your so smart. Thank you showing us your life. ❤️
I was talking to a couple of my buddies and we’re sick of watching the travel part of all videos from all the channels that we watch. We just want to watch the repairs being made. That’s what we want to see.
Slm türkiye
Woah what an ending! I'm sure you fixed it in the end. We all have faith in you.
Who is🙃 the Boy toy
Andrew, ótimo trabalho o seu em manutenção de seus veículos, dou um conselho para evitar a ferrugem nas suas máquinas, pulverizar elas com diesel. Proteja muito o ferro.
20:15 reminds me of the film A Fish Named Wanda !
" that's an ignorable fire"
"it looked like igonrable fire" LOL 😀
Are you planning to pave the road with lawnmowers
you soon have more machines than the dealer you buy them from
Most thrilling entertainment since the mulching lawnmower video.  There is only one way for anything to survive the Camarata test:  don’t be part of a Camarata test.
Should have brought that Ferrari mate.
Suprised everyone survived at the end
I wanna see ya fix that. 😆😆😆
Like everything else, buys sight unseen, turns out to be a POS, buys new. Over the years I’ve seen this guy waste more money than even Heath from RPR.  very entertaining.
Make the call, call up Matts Towing and Recovery see if the Banana will come pull it up :D
I love the side by side up on the container. Basically everything I would be doing if I had access to this equipment.
Lol I was waiting for the trip up the mountain you should make a compilation of everything going up the mountain, it’s the most entertaining thing on YouTube
Well .... That did not go well! Got a handy D8... or two?
Blue is a grown up puppy. Now that I see you working on it, I can understand why you got it cheap. Time to get the heavy chains and the dosser.
Hi! Joe's Flat Rate Mower Repair? Can you fix this? LOL
Someones having fun.. Gunshot at 3:44
Son: dad we need a roller Dad: we won't gonna buy a roller  Dad with roller after 5 min  12:50
Let's Get Rolling!
That thing is just Rolling all over u there at the end. Lol
8K? Oy Vey..
She has a little bit of play in the articulation joint but for what it cost.
Fill potholes with rocks or old lawn mowers!
Coming soon: Camarata Equipment Rentals
who made that battery hold down ?
That lawn mower should be a lot easier to post now?
Roller needs a water tank to stop tar sticking
That's not quiet what you do with those but exactly what I'd do
hahaha lol dumb and dumberer
This brings back memories of old letterman segments (before everything was politics)    Great vid. Enjoy the purchase.
Buying the old stuff is better. Too many electronics on new equipment plus the prices are over the top. I'll stick with my old case 1835c.
I thought you would be using the 10 wheel dump to haul equipment
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🍻🍻🍻☕️☕️☕️👍👍👍👀👀👀🥃🥃🥃🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Shop wall art
Poor lawnmower.  Lol
those mowers are such garbage - they broke for no reason.  You roll over them one time and they get all smashed up.
Anderw!! The word of the day for U is Roll bar!
*buys roller. "first job is to destroy some lawnmowers". Love it.
12:20 bring it to taryl fixes all haha 😂
That's really going to flatten out them roads in the rocks you crushed crush Stone in your rock crusher
Pretty stuck
"ignorable fire" 🤣
And that's why a cast iron block is better.
“It looks like an ignorable fire”. Lol.
Hi Andrew. Are there any wild animals you need to be wary of around your property?
What was that excavator you almost bought? Never seen one of them before? What's it for?
Who needs a shredder when you have a roller? 12:46. 😂
"Who needs a rock crusher when you've got a roller"   (buys rock crusher shortly after) lol classic
Rolling rolling got to keep the roller rolling roll on there Andrew
Reminds me of the video when you talked about your little bulldozer going down the hill😂
You got your moneys worth out of the Ford dump truck, thanks for posting a new video
When was this back in the summer?
As soon as I saw the lawn mower in front of the roller I started laughing good times lol 😆 🤣
That's going to come in handy on the new road !
Andrew is aiming to own one of everything by the time he’s 40 I guess 🙂
atleast its still right side up lol
Rocking and Rolling
Варвары..
Rock & Roll Pot Hole Patrol
It shouldn't have brakes if it's hydrostatic you just go from forward to reverse. Also the drum should be spinning
292nd!!!
Got me wondering...what's the longest video you're working on? You got some content you have saved up from like 15 years ago or something like that? Most channels put out 50 videos to tell a story but not my man Andrew Camerata. This man gives you the story in one telling.   Stay golden ponyboy
Dam* you Camarata.  I was about to go outside and do stuff.
Is Andrew a shopoholic? He buys machines as I buy socks.
wow! thats a deal for 8k! hope it does what you want.
Was expected😂
Finally a new video! we've been waiting for it! Thanks for that Andrew! Greetings from Braunschweig Germany
Look at the curves on that rolla ! Lookin goooood..
Nice looking yellow trike!
But is it heavier than your 6 wheeler if not how can it pack better
I've wondered when u were gna get one
Brakes, you do not need brakes on a mountain, they just slow down production LOL. Wish you would post videos daily.
Sweet!! Been wondering when we would see a video on this.
You don't need any brakes.
Hey Andrew, love the uploads mate, keep up the good work. And I was wondering If you could mention me in 1 of your videos please
cheers! :-)
Oh boy, eat you’re heart out Mike Morgan..
You don't need to tell us "no brakes". Pretty much understood at this point.
I wish I had 8 grand Id be on cloud 99
I don't believe it I got the first like in Right on thank you again for an awesome video Andrew
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😎
Hello!🙂 It would have been better if he went backwards up the hill.  The drum is not propelled.  That's a pretty good roller.  I hope Andrew doesn't destroy it.
Тбырат очин рощий вио
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍.
Хороший прицеп 👍
That will be first comment then
I’m early
😎 what's up Andrew 👍
❤
