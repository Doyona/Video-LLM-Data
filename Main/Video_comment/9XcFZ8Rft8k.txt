Politicians will Secrafice anyone if it's in the interests of the politicians to do so. It was easier to send this cop to jail for 20 years than deal with riots as a result of an acquittal
This judge was a joke!! The way the prosecution was questioning they're witnesses, it was like the witnesses had to think about the question to answer. Even when Derek Chauvin attorney was cross examining the prosecution witnesses. Same thing!! The witnesses had to have a good memory to tell the truth. The judge and juries we're obviously clueless. We need judges like judge judy. Because like judge judy always says " if you're telling the truth, you don't need a good memory ".
he should do jail time for being a corrupt and a bully police...  but not murder Floyd killed himself with drugs
Hope you enjoy living in he--😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬
I don't think he is come out of jail other than  in a death bag
Derek Chauvin is a scary individual!! Just the look on his face scares the hell out of me!!! He won’t last 5 years in prison I bet!!
Justice definitely served!!! 👊👊👊👊👊🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈
I can’t breathe ! 🥺🥺🥺 it was traumatizing to watch G.Floyd die like this. So cruel.
It must be rather annoying for that guy in the background who is trying to study or write his work email.  Looks like this trial was in a coffee shop
We hope the officers deserved a second chance and truth revealed, but the black lives matter made a big whoops for defend wrong people.  Until this year memorial square into safe haven for culture gangsters's fair rights.
What's with the video of the rioters on the left how is that relevant. Fucking low IQ news organization
Mob law. It was either charg him or have the city burned.
So bad that this case was dragged into racism. It had nothing to do with that. This wouldn't have happened if GF had done what the cops  told him to do.
He looks genuinely confused...justice is served
BLM, you will have the same. Your time is coming. What you sow, you will get 7 times more.
Hope u have a good rest of your life 👍
His reaction reminds me of Colm O'Driscoll from RDR2 when he knew he was gonna get hanged at the gallows with no chance of escaping
#defundthepolice #fuck12
One of the biggest travesties of justice ever. Chauvin is a hero that simply rid our sick society of a low-life thug - and is now paying for his action due to the thugs and criminals taking over the media and political agenda. America and Americans need to take back their country from the gangs and thugs and stop this sort of madness. Like Duterte is  doing in the Philipines. Rid the streets of all these scum!
GF was evil anyway.
You can tell that even the judge wanted him to be guilty as well.
Finally. All we were asking. ACCOUNTABILITY
Enjoy prison asshole. I am sure you will be popular.
He is a heartless, HORRIBLE MAN….  HAS NO MORALS OR FEELINGS☠️
Every racist rat has its day! Today was yours Chauvin!! I pray they don’t do to you what you did to Floyd…
Democrat's are going to have a stroke when all the investigation is over and they start putting these sorry corrupt politicians in jail where they belong they who they are just watch they can't answer questions that are asked to them sign of guilt to me if trump had of not run for president they would still be screwing the American people including you my friend.
If sitting there looking dumb was a person
RIP dawg we noe you is in heavin smilin down wit a fat blunt today, GF.  Just kidding. Oh my goodness, what if I really talked like that? 😆
Don't drop the soap in there 😂🤣😅 and if he thinks that somebody will protect him in there he's got it all wrong they do not like cops in prison have fun in there you racist murderous cop 😂🤣
Bye bye scumbag
X served
That nigga Derek Chauvin eyes doing mortal kombats fatality’s. ↘️➡️⬅️↙️↘️⬆️⬇️🔀🔁🔄🔃
He has NO emotion! No regret! No remorse!
He is going to spend the rest his natural life in prison. This isn't the first time he's done something like this. He held a 14 year old boy down on the ground with his knee on his back for 17 minutes, and hit him in the head with his flashlight several times. A 14 YEAR OLD MINOR. There is a special place in Hell for this coward.
It was a setup all along. Brandon Mitchell( one of the jurys) was from BLM movement. This just shows you how biased this trial really was. Innocent man will be put in prison for their safety. America law system is a joke.
I think the police academy needs to start making some serious adjustments with their teachings in order to prevent more of what Chauvin did
idiot things the judge is talking to him when he nods his head
Job is not gonna be in office for long
enjoy the cells
Maybe his wife will be happier spending all that cash on a chocolate bar now🤣🤣🤣🤣 This could had been prevented by just telling the man to go home.
Of course you have shit verdicts when you have a bunch of sub 20 IQ liberals as the fucking jury. The jury isn't competent enough to make a verdict
One year ago today...🙏🏿
No one is talking about thousands of deaths caused by the mRNA poison.  See for yourself https://youtu.be/pWQ-DTr_fGw
The moment when hear hears the guilty verdict on all three counts and starts looking around frantically like a frightened trapped animal as it sinks in that he took his own life when he took George Floyd's life is so deeply satisfying. I rewatch it often, not just to see Derek Chauvin panicking internally, but to hear the verdict that is without a doubt the biggest step and sacrifice for racial equality in decades.
nothing is better than seeing Derek Chauvin put in cuffs!!!!
He should have been charged with 1st degree murder since he just suffocated him for 10 minutes thats premaditated murder and he dont seem like he is sorry he should get at least 40 years for being a dirty racist cop smh
Shouldve listened to the bystanders
With him facing up to 75 years for state charges, and who knows how long for the federal charges, I highly doubt he’ll ever walk free again. April 19, 2021 will always remembered as the last day this man ever walked free.
What a fall from grace lost his wife lost his job lost money lost his freedom. Federal civil right charges to going to lose his house. If he could go back in time and just take his knee off.
threw his life.away.bet he regrets it idiot
George Floyd deserved to have spent a lot longer in prison. That. Wing said he didn’t deserve to die just to maybe be beaten senseless because holding a gun to a pregnant woman’s stomach is pure fucking evil and she will never not have ptsd
He will be wearing the famous jumpsuit and jesus slippers next time we see him
Hahaha, finally a case where the slob gets to go to prison
George Floyd OD'd on Fentanyl and suffocated due to it. It was partially the police officers fault for making him stressed out as he was clearly intoxicated but it was his fault for taking Fentanyl. He also wasn't a "gentle giant" he has committed more crimes than the average person in his lifetime including armed robbery. Including the fact that his death caused 40 people to die and hundreds injured. And over 2 billion in property damage not even owned by the government. Civilian property damaged over George Floyd's death. Pretty ridiculous, and the fact that Derek Chauvin is the one who kneed on his neck. But at the same time there were 3 other officers in the vicinity that could have stopped him. Why arent they getting the spotlight as well? The minorities want someone to blame. Be aware of what you see in the media and why they want you to see it.
Put his ass in prison. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Yellow shirt girl wearing a blazer.😋.
Judge is drunk. Plastered.😂.
Blaming the police officers for Floyd’s death is like blaming the fighter fighters for the collapses of the Twin Towers.
I hope the inmates kneel on his neck while he cries for his mom, passes out and pisses himself. Then continue to kneel on his neck for another 10 minutes then when people call them out they should just say he was coming off of crack. Hopefully all the other cops there that day get the same fate.
POS!!!!!
God should give one chance to the police man..  Chauvin
Mans really just looked so fucking shocked with every yes. SIR it’s been a YEAR you know this would happen
And  this black  boom will  be  Saint  soon........US and A  became a funny  country
Horray
This is crazy, I feel sorry for Derek and his family. Because Floyd does have a HuGE criminal record. Im pretty sure all officers check your license and info in their computer before taking actions. Floyd should not be praised or looked uo to, he is a criminal. I watch the video footage numerous of times of him resistanting arrest, its simple,corporate with the officers, dont try to get off the police car or move. Sit, chill, have an attorney represent you if anything. No need for lives to be lost or taken.
Honestly,  I really pity this man! He never imagined that he would ever be where he is today. I don't think he meant to kill George Floyd but, he did mean to demean him, disrespect him, and to treat him as if he wasn't a human being. He consciously decided to over step his boundaries as an officer; feeling like the law didn't apply to him and ultimately, it cost George Floyd his life and also his own's. Just sad! A lack of common respect for others will cause you to do the unimaginable!  People had better learn how to listen to God when he's speaking!!
I have a feeling he’s going to disappear. The FBI IS going to “move” him and he will never be heard of again.
You Made Your Bed Chauvin, Now You Gotta Lay In That Sh**!💯 I Imagine That Ppl In Prison Are Patiently Waiting On Your A**! Too Late 2 Say Sorry 2!  #PUNISHMENT The STORM Is Coming 4 Ya!!!     R.I.P George Floyd
His face says, "Guilty??! But...but...I'm a white man!"
The jury was threatened, they had no choice.
ive never broken the law I AM THE LAW!
Almost forgot to watch this today
he's not worried..... he knows he's going to "white jail" hence the calm relaxed look in his eyes.
the judge taking his sweet time
I disagree
G. Floyd ceased to be connected to the low frequencies of universal energy, but D. Chauvin will continue to be connected to the lowest frequencies of the low frequencies of universal energy until the day he gets shanked up in prison. My point is that both individuals are /were and will always be remembered as scumbags.
There’s no way this guy got a fair trail !  He was a scape goat first! Was he guilty I don’t know but not having his trail moved .  Floyd had under lying health issues that in know way was of knowledge to the police.   He had a warrant for his arrest had he complied he would be alive.  What gave him the right to resist?    There are lots of unknowns.   I do believe that that officer himself had some sort of mental problems!
FREE THIS MAN PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
Get his racist murderer ass outta here bye 👋
I held a party when he was charged  He a monster
he was really trying to process everything 💀
Jury: 2nd degree murder Chauvin: 👀
Derek wants to press his knee on the judge's neck here.
Every white American know the laws, what is the difference of the white racist cops back in the days wrongly arrest a black man which was illegal kidnapping, drive by the woods opened the car door and tell him to go, as he walked away he shot him in the back and killed and said he was trying to run away and that cop was not help accountable  The laws of today is the same laws in the 1700s that was designed against black people, the laws will not change until the cops start killing white people, those laws are set by federal government and local government thats why white people do not protest against them like they do for illegal immigrants and gun laws  How many states file law suits against Trump for the conditioned of the illegal immigrants even though they broke the laws and he also warned them not to broke the law, how come they never warned us that the white cops there to kill instead of protecting us like they do the white community, the gay community and the jewish community.  Every white person are okay with those laws thats why they never changed, they are just pretending that they are sorry for black people, if they did they would stand up as strong as they do for the gun laws that they always fighting for every time there is a mass shooting in their community  You can put a mask over racism to hide your involvement but you cannot hide your action and black blood in your hand we see it every day we wake up, corporate America control racism and the negros they hired are there to help them promote it, thats why none of them can stand up to their corporation, they are too weak, they dont hold no authorities they are just collecting a check from the white bosses to play the game of diversity.  Dont delete the comments, let the world read about the reality of hate.
The girl in the yellow shirt wearing a blazer is pretty.😊.
Been crying for monthts for this. I,m mother for three from Finland. I.m non violent but this individual should be dissmissed from this planet
Pee in is pants you listen when the people tell u get off is neck u never listen
🤣🤣🤣🤣 HE WAS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER SIDE BAR TO TELL HIM IT WAS A JOKE LOL
I wish he had no mask on to see his full reaction..
Glad that murderous cop is behind bar's!! Now we need to do the same to any other corrupt cop out there!!
Number 27 was Mexican
If they were to put your cowardly a** in general population, you would have those same darting  eyes for about 6 hours or so, until they harmed/ killed you !!!!!
He is going to be in isolation for the rest of his life in prison. He could have made a better choice Derek Chauvin let his ego, pride and anger get the better of him. He was a cop with a badge now he's an EX COP going to Prison. RIP GEORGE FLOYD JUSTICE WAS SERVED!
Don't drop the soap, Derek.
He didn't get away with murder.  Times up!
Parole after 7 Years.. no one is talking bout that..
That racist bastard,pardon language literally thought he'd get away with it,for Gods sake it's not 1965 he should rot in prison😦😦😦😦
Heureusement qu'il a était filmer sinon il serait pas coupable
Best 4/20 ever
I would like to know what does the color of chauvin has to do with what he did. This cop is just like other cops of any color out there. I’ve been a victim of police brutality. I’m white and the cops were black, white, Hispanic, and even a Chinese cop. Cops are cops. What this dope did was because he was a cop that was a bad cop and not trained properly. I don’t believe he did what he did because the perpetrator was black. There are no good cops and maybe good cops. He’s a bad cop. To bring racism into this is really not fair for the population because he was a bad cop. There is not one person on this planet that likes what this cop did yet the family of Floyd is bringing race up.  It’s true the blacks are targeted a lot. But it’s also true that black youth hang out in the streets a lot. So please don’t bring race into this for this particular incident that is irrelevant and unfair.
*Well, well, well, how the turntables...*
Cheer up old chap, I still have my freedom    :)
I wish the judge had ordered him to remove his mask.
i missed something: there had not been any mention of racism and institutional racism - are we made to believe it is just an individual killer?
I really do like the judge, seems like a cool dude.
No remorse whatsoever 😤😤
5:15 - What did Eric Nelson say to Chauvin, that's puzzling to me that Chauvin just nodded.
Now is not the time to be  celebrating and dancing in the streets! The man hasn't been sentenced yet! His  sentencing may just be a slap in the face!!!!!
Guilty guilty guilty..murderer 👎
He is a monster look at his eyes I feel fear when I look at that pose, So sad that he has ruined not only Mr floyd but his too and both families God have mercy on him that he will ask for forgiveness 👹
Lord see his crime and punish him in prison like they did Sandra Bland 🙏🏾 Amen
This is good for America ..lot of people do not know this country have improved a lot on race relationship but this area of policing is the remaining obstacle to that journey .
Same name, different actor. All dummies believing in the Floyd psyop got fooled
The sentencing was about as high as George floyds Fentanyl levels.
I can't help to wonder if they planned this because they were afraid of the reaction of the country... because he is way too calm like his attorney said don't worry you are not going to prison... you know.. us marchalls change his identity i dont know may be I watch too many movies lol
Cypress College Athletic Councilor Dana Bedard low bids the state bond for the buildings.  Dana Bedard has allot of homes,  boats and jet skies from stealing from the taxes. Dana Bedard is at Cypress College phone number 714 484 7387
He thought he was gonna get off dough he couldn't believe it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why is their favoritism in law enforcement.  Cypress College phone number 714 484 7387 or 714 484 7455.  Retired LA County Sheriff Captain Ralph Webb extorted me from my job and bank account.  Ralph Webb is Cypress College Director.
He’s shocked 😳... he can’t believe it.
What is his sentence?
Say goodbye to your wife and kids, your guns, and your right to vote, Derek. Forever.
Guilty
They had to find him guilty. Think of what would’ve happened if the verdict came back not guilty. Riots in every city. 🔥
asesino desvergonzado...    y como si nada hubiera pasado
He was clearly guilty.
This kind of videos shouldn,t allow comments.
Sweet dreams asshole
He's panicking. Just look at his eyes. He really thought he was gonna be set free.
And it was at 1:59 that DC realized he fucked up lol
In 20 years, it'll be illegal to be white in the United States.😐
most of you ass holes standing outside wouldn't have pissed on Floyds head if it was on fire
Chauvin’s eyes were darting around like ours do when we be staring at our crush across the room and they glance back at us 😭😭😭  #UnexpectedEyeContactMoments
He took the verdict like a man and didn't resist arrest .......he knows he's getting a mistrial on appeal or a sentence of 12 years .he will be in his 50's when let out . still alot of life to live .
Looking at these videos now, if that was a relative of mine on the ground like that no way I could stand there and say they can't breathe..that other cop guarding him needs the same sentence
It’s the confused worried look for me 🤣
The Guards in that prison need to ask for pay hikes right now, because they gonna work overtime trying to protect this a*shole. Looking shook as hell right now huh, Chauvin?!!🤔
Just a friendly message not related to this video☺️God loves you, no matter who you are, where you’re from or what you’ve done. He’s waiting with open arms for you to accept Him into your lives. Please repent of your sins and ask God for forgiveness. He loves and cares for you. Jesus has already paid the price for all of our sins, you just need to believe in Him that he’s our saviour and begin to live right with God. I love you and hope you have a lovely day. God Bless You☁️🙌
Nice.
This guy never stood a chance for a fair trial, this whole situation is terrible and saddens me. 2 lives lost at one time.
They checked his pulse and still stood on him when they didn’t find it. They stayed there even when the paramedics got there and told them to stay back. Fuck Chauvin and fuck the cops with him who allowed him to kill Floyd.  Really wish he had a courtroom freak out because he is already going in the history of infamy.
I go back and look at the George Floyd video and I don’t feel no remorse for this sick man
Into Bidens New and Safe America where everybody is equal as whole and not judged because of race religion political views or where you come from it's time to embrace this moment people and celebrate
Fuck America's justice.
Race war is absolutely raging in the USA. The same people who love the lockdowns, the destruction of the economy, the people losing jobs and who have been enjoying the Covid tragedy for more than a year are the same people who hate America so much that they want to destroy the country as we know it. They want to destroy white people, white culture, white history.  All evil will get back. This is your moment. It is not going to last forever.
Did anyone else notice what Derek Chauvin did after his conviction on three counts of murder, had his bail revoked, and was remanded to the police for incarceration? Chauvin calmly stood, put his hands behind his back, and allowed himself to be handcuffed, and quietly led away. Chauvin was likely VERY distressed by the outcome of the VERY SHORT trial, and yet he was completely cooperative. Where might we be today, if George Floyd had acted in a similar manner, while being arrested by Chauvin / the Minneapolis police? Pretty interesting contrast in behavior I would sa
In the UK we have heros called Dale Cregan. Harry Roberts. And Raoul Moat
Chauvin was just doing his job now he's been used as a scapegoat
He killed many people before something the media never talk about
Lol that will hold him.
Hats off to the white Jurists who convicted Chauvin on the evidence, Compre that with the racist black Jurists who cleared OJ Sipson.
Not so “cocky” now eh?       X
It's a shame this trial didn't follow the rule of law and was heavily politicised, here is to hoping he gets a mistrial.
Chauvinist.
He looks so confused; if he didn’t kill anyone this situation never would have happened
okay USA
How many years does he have in prison?
Derek Chauvik lives matter.🙌
I must say he did handle it like a man and showed respect to the court. min 5.05
Finally a court that does the right thing. Let his be a lesson to the hot headed power cops that their reign is OVER and you can and will go to prison!
No emotion whatsoever......smh Oh well.  In a uniform 1 day. Jumpsuit the next. Think about your actions at all times.  #georgefloyd
I hate him when he killed George floyd, but I'm here now feeling sad about his execution.
My prayer for Derek: Dear God, we know Derek did tremendous damage by committing a murder. You said that murderers should are not allowed in the kingdom of heaven. As much as I wanted him to be found guilty, as a broken sinner myself, I do feel some grief and sadness to see Derek in jail now. The punishment fits the crime and even though he may not know you or be found repentant now, I sure hope that he may find forgiveness in Jesus. For George and Derek, if they both find victory in coming into your kingdom we hope there will be a moment of reconciliation, peace, love, and forgiveness.  The ultimate sin is that our own sins how small or big has caused you to be murdered on the cross over 2000 years ago on the cross.  We are glad Justice prevailed today but we also hope and pray Derek finds salvation in you O Lord. Amen. 🙏
Total waste of tax dollars.  Obey the law, comply with Police and don't do drugs. You'll live longer.
This is sad. Chauvin has turned into a fallen hero well...at least he was a hero protecting citizen until he made a wrong decision and ended up in jail. He probably did not think he can kill a big man by putting his knee on the neck. Whatever he had in mind I don’t think he wanted to harm George, he misjudge things because of distraction from the crowd but I don’t think anyone would but that excuse. No one wins here such a sad circumstance. The law can charge you in murder even if you did not mean to harm anyone but the result was death. It does not make him a true murderer his action were that of a confused individual.
I see a lot of people saying justice was served, but they're all missing a key word from that sentence. I'll fix it for you all: "Mob justice was served". The man was simply found "guilty" because people would riot otherwise. Just the usual sacrifising the scapegoat.
The fact that i saw businesses boarding up there buildings for there safety is really fucking sad .. Hes guilty thats awesome now go home..
Give him at least 20 years in PRISON!
May this ring loud through every police station and officers head that the people will no longer stand for these unjustices they've been getting away with.
I don't know why many people rejoice at a wrong verdict: this is a FIRST DEGREE MURDER + AGGRAVATED BY RACISM!  This killer has murdered intentionally a "black" innocent man, because he's clearly a racist. And moreover, he cowardly took advantage of the fact that he was a police officer; he took advantage of the fact that they were the four of them against a single, handcuffed, immobilised man that couldn't be able to BREATHE!  This is not justice, this is the failure of the American justice! People started to rejoice even before knowing how many DECADES of prison is going to have this "white" killer... This is clearly the failure of American justice, and I'm sure they had to find him guilty just because the case was so evident and the whole world's eyes were on that court. Therefore, be ready to prepare a bloody revolution in this fascist country with the rest of the world.
Let's just hope he actually stays in jail!😒😒😒😒😒😒everybody knows how the system can work!!!
There are certain exceptions to the right to use force in response to excessive force by the police. Self-defense against the use of excessive force during an arrest will not apply if the officer is using excessive force because of the actions of the person being arrested. As with other forms of self-defense, an individual must stop using force against the officer if the officer stops using excessive force. In other words, they cannot retaliate. They also must stop resisting the arrest with force if they have reason to believe that stopping resistance will cause the officer to stop using excessive force.
So glad that we got footage of a "black Friday outside of Walmart....wait, what's that you say? It's not black Friday? Well then let's just all stand around nut to butt and act like covid never happened....
It truly amazes me people watch this stuff A: actually believe all of it, every word, as if its reality B: Still believe that theres a thing called justice in this world C: And are completely clueless they live in a fake programmed fantasy land called REALITY TV!  I PROMISE if anyone has the balls to just shut their tv off and walk away from it for at least 1 month they will be blown away and forever grateful their brains dont belong to the media, corporations, and their ever so loving Governments anymore! You arent even you anymore! You havent had an original idea or one of your own thoughts for probably your hole life! Your reality is work and propaganda and it's truly sad you're ok with that.
0:38 he's getting used to having his hands behind his back 😂
He will definitly be using that knee alot in prison.
Chauvin did this to himself at the end of the day!
Even though he’s going to prison he will be in protective custody
Bye bye 👋😗
Merciless..for a handcuffed ..breathless human being
I really wished he would had burst into tears like Daniel Holzclaw during his guilty sentencing.
Your opinion sucksz
I’m not saying what Chauvin did was a acceptable in any way at all in fact it was completely disgraceful but this story has taken away from the fact that George Floyd was a life long criminal for example holding a gun to a pregnant woman as he robbed her, George Floyd was charged of this and this woman probably was left with dramatic side effects after this incident, so please don’t wash over the fact George Floyd was a criminal to
Free my guy he’s innocent
The Start of something new, 🙌🏾
It’s Derek eyes for me 😂😂😂😂😂 tht orange jumpsuit looks good on you Derek have fun in jail byyyyyeeeee ✌🏽✌🏽
He will take his own life inside of a week. Or ask for a retrial or house arrest or desk duty.  Not a good soul in that particular unit.
Invest heavily in vasilene you dirty rogue murdering cop.so long! enjoy your stay as reality shatters your fantasy blue line ego. Never bite the hand that feeds you.
Bad cop. Fuck him.   There are good people who work in the police and this murderer deserves his time in jail.
He will get out in 15 years for “good behavior”.. he won’t do life like he should. I’m a firm believer in the death penalty and this is what chauvin should of gotten is the death penalty. I also don’t care about how anyone feels about it either. Eye for an eye. He knew what he was doing. Death penalty does not get used enough. This is a perfect time to change that
I almost feel bad for the guy... Almost.
he prob be dead after 2 weeks
Dam are some white people slow because they will rather see a black person die just for being black wow I can't stand some white people but killing them because I don't like them is stupid I have a family and no way I would do something to fuck that up over petty shit even if he don't serve alot of time in prison he still will be miserable .....smh
My heart dropped just watching this. I know he was sick listening to the verdict
Good job avoiding a riot. Bet you never hear or see him again. He will be put in protective custody in some far away place with a new name and new look
wooohooo bye bye murderer
To those saying he is gonna get fucked up in prison etc, he will be sheltered and kept away from people that would fuck with him for the probable 8 years he will serve
Lock Chauvin up with some black dudes in one cell
I'm glad he got a fair trial.  I agree with their verdict.
this black lives matter shit is finally over now right???
Ooouuu I love this song!
When you live by the 🗡 sword...You die by the sword.
My thoughts are with Derek and his family.  I don't like the police in any shape or form but he was doing his job and protecting the public from a junked up scumbag who would have driven off to plow his car, or whoever's car he may have car-jacked or stolen, into innocent people.
He knew what he was doing, he knew what he has done, and now he knows what he will go through...
sum wite fokes mAd
People say he had no reaction. His eyes were darting back and forth and you could see his expression under his mask. He knew it was coming but it hit him like a ton of bricks. Now he sits at Oak Park until sentencing and he is moved. I can only imagine the fear he has even though he is in PC. Well, perhaps he shouldn’t of murdered a human being!! George can Rest In Peace with his mama now!!
I KNOW A MAN WHO PAYD SOMEONE TO KILL HIS BABYS MOTHER AND HE GOT 20 YEARS FOR CONSPIRACY SMH HES GETTING 15 YEARS FOR KILLING A MAN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE WHY BECAUSE HE WAS A OFFICER OF THE LAW NO OTHER REASON ONLY EXPLINATION IS THEY FEEL HE DOESNT DESERVE FIRST DEGREE MURDER CHARGES BECAUSE HE WAS A OFFICER OF THE LAW... IF ANY AVERAGE AMERICAN WHO DIDNT HAVE A STATUS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD DID THIS THEY WOULD BE FACING 25-LIFE OR LIFE WITHOUT NO QUESTIONS ASKED THIS TRIAL TOOK 15 DAYZ THE LONGEST IVE EVER SEEN GIVEN TO ANY DEFENDANT AND HE HAD EVERY TOOL A DEFENDANT COULD ASK FOR AT HIS FINGERTIPS YOU WILL NEVER IN THIS LIFETIME SEE A MAN FROM  POVERTY HAVE A DEFENSE THIS MAN GOT UNLESS IT GETS NATIONAL MEDIA AND A BIG ATTORNEY TAKES HIS CASE PROBONO FOR THE PUBLICITY ITS JUST CRAZY THIS MAN DESERVES OTHJING LESS THEN LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE!!!!💯💯💯
Thank GOD to the one's that recorded it all taking place.
Gloating over this makes you no better than Chauvin
I came to see this video, to see the look on his face as he realises that his badge is no longer there to protect him. While he’s still breathing, a luxury he didn’t afford his victim, I hope he finds peace deep within his rotten soul because the things he did was unforgivable.
If I was a cop I’d just hand in my badge and gun and say good luck when it all crumbles
Was it was it worth it , Yes it was in his shifty little eyes 👀🙄😳🥺😵😏🧐🤓☹️😆☺️😉😝🤩🥸😎😱🤫
I feel bad for George Floyd but at the same time the trial brought to light something I never knew.  I thought George Floyd was some kind of saint or something but in the trial it came out he was using fentanyl every 20 minutes.  Fentanyl is only given at the hospital and the fact this guy was using so much of it makes me think he was buying it from the black market or from some kind of cartel or cartel associate.  I don't get why people burned down the town of a man using fentanyl every 20 minutes.
This is the big Macher gucken of the World sheer eöetrk sher
We Smokin that Derek Chauvin PACK TONIGHT 😈
He will be out in a year, right a bok and be a millionaire. Sell his story to oprah and make another million and retire in barbados. ONLY IN AMERICA.
I’m so glad that they wasn’t persuaded by either side and was able to see the case without bias. All black people want is Justice!!!! A fair shot in the legal system. Chauvin was given justice and Floyd was given death.. Somethings just doesn’t seem fair. I wish George Floyd could see how much his death impacted all of us. And we’re sorry that his transition to the next life was so brutal and hard to watch.   Rest Well George ♥️
Chauvin's reaction may have been silent, but it did not seem stoic to me, as I watched his eyes when the verdicts were read. I saw raw fear in his eyes.
He already had him cuffed and restrained, he wasn't going anywhere, there was no need to kneel on him.  He clearly said he couldn't breathe.  American police need to seriously look at themselves, heavy handed, gun crazy, up their own back sides.... We could go on.... The world is watching for a decent sentence now......
FINALLY JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD. REST IN POWER
I saw that man suffer and my heart broke  things  must change we all human beings.
Great news for the Faimly and friends of George Floyd and the community.My prayers are with you all 🗽✌😁!!
I'm not here to back up the cop but two wrongs don't make it right either.  WHY THE F@!# DO PEOPLE KEEP DOING THE DUMBEST SHIT WHEN THEY'RE BEING DETAINED BY OFFICERS?? REALLY THOUGH! SMH FOOLS WANNA GO AGAINST THE GRAIN AND WHEN SHIT HITS THE FAN THEY WANNA BITCH ABOUT IT...NOW FLOYD IS SEEN AS THE GOOD FATHER TO HIS YOUNG DAUGHTER WHO CAN LOOK UP TO HIM AS A ROLE MODEL "SO THEY SAY"...GTFOH THE GUY WAS PUSHIN' FAKE MONEY AND    GETTING HIGH ALL THE TIME WITH A RAP SHEET A MILE LONG.
Took long but at least George Floyd finally got his justice all we need is to wait for his sentencing
I'm confused about how do people get murdered during peaceful protests? lol, At least stats are showing BLM for the destructive group they are.
Good shit
This is so wrong the only answer here is God to come back that's wont  be rigged
Politically Motivated Lynching to Appease Savages ................
I give him a week before he's in a gutter! Ex-cop/killer wont do well behind bars!
"I love his eyes; I bet he has a tight butt too. He's going to be wife for me." -Bubba
He has fear in his eyes just like his victim had!! Thank you to the jury!🙌🙏
Tbh he looks like Zuckerberg(no hate)🤣🤣🤣🤣
i actually kind of feel bad for him........ had he thought before doing what he did, we would have 2 more happy souls today
Yeh fuck u dickhead
Key word "UNINTENTIONAL"
Now what will the rioters blame their riots on?
Can he face death penalty ?
UK Commenter Jury just handed justice over to mob rule
anyone wanna stand on my damn neck or something illo get you 27 millys on god
Have fun in prison piece of 💩🙌👏
This needs to happen more often , the UK police are also getting too heavy handed , also breaking the law on many occasions , Chauvin is not so cocky or clever now is he , justice served .
Maybe our Nation should recruit more Black Police Officers to police minorities and people of color.
The guilty party killed a man. The  Justice prevailed.
The look on Derrick's face was like "WTF". 😂
That look when your white privilege had been revoked
Actually, for one heart stopping moment, Floyd now has the grand distinction and ignominy of being the most celebrated criminal on the lower astral Plane as countless spooks have possessed BLM'S bodies and have vicariously enjoyed extreme violence without consequences. And they are there to stay ; which is very bad news for BLM and Antifa activists..
DEREK CHAUVIN. NOW YOU WILL BE. SOMEBODY'S BITCH! 😁😁
Brand new lamborghini
The knee resting on Floyd's neck was a light restraining  force.  It had nothing to do with Floyd's death.  His buddies sharing his (Floyd's)  body were responsible. Just look at the family after the money if you don't believe.
I feel bad for the man but that's what you get
Boy do he feel stupid....got emmmmm
Beginning of mob rule.  Check the French Revolution for reference, folks.  I wouldn't sound so cocky if I were you.
He did not kill anyone. It was Floyd's spooky friend's  (parked up in their partner in crime's astral body)  who stopped his heart. They knew the consequences which their action would provoke,  in corrupt American politics,  and,  that it would lead to the democrats hi jacking the death,  to support violence against the President Trump administration which is why Pelosi promptly scooted over to Minneapolis's  city centre and  (with the media filming) with BLM  soldiers went down on her knee and swore undying allegiance to  BLM  and Antifa's cause.
The fact that he’s shocked says a lot. You literally killed someone, like what 😂
I'm drinking his tears and loving his shock when they announce it
Hoping this pig of a cop gets the same treatment in prison he gave to George Floyd.
The people have a voice and it is resonating with the great Liberty Bell  , Let my poeple go ! God bless America ,the land of the brave
Hey Alexa play Ice Cube Today Was A Good Day🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
It must be very sad to be arrested by your own officers/comrades for his such decisions.
Hey Alexa play N.W.A Fuck The Police🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶
The name's Tobin. Martin Tobin and I'm here to kick ass and take names. For FREE.
I TOLD BEFORE AND I SAY AFTER, ALL MUST WEARING SUIT OR TAXEDO AND POLICE NOT TOO MUCH VIOLENCE NOMORE, QUILTY IS WHAT YOU WEARING, BELIEVE ME, TAXEDO HELP
Time to make driving a right end all traffic stops
This is fake its all been planned
1 murderous cop down, 999 to go!
I don’t know what the world is coming to...🤢💩
L
The verdict took my breath away!
While Dereck chauvin ll be going to jail, I guess the entire police department he represents should be ashamed of them selves..
Can someone please analyze and read chauvin’s body language and eye expressions ?
Stoic and unemotional.  Same exact look as when George Floyd's life was ending.
He was only found guilty to prevent more riots or looting and more murders of those riots and looting.  We all saw the videos, he was not guilty of murder. George murdered himself. The media manipulated everything and they are the only guilty ones here. They manipulated the riots and then Manipulated the verdict.  Anyone and everyone that thinks the cop is guilty is the racist ones. Only them. Mob mass hysteria. They just want to see someone die. For the thrill of it. Not for justice. It has nothing to do with justice.
This verdict is the result of pressure from the BLM.
Derek know from is heart that he is guilty  so he make up is mind for what verdicts come they should take im to the doctor he looking confuse it seam like im don't know what going on im just just nod is head an leave
Hit thumbs up if you AGREE that if George Floyd was white, we would never hear about this.
Praise GOD
As a taxpayer i feel screwed. 26 million dollars of tax payer money went to a drug dealers/ addicts family(George Floyd), then the cop gets arrested so im gonna be footing his bill for food and housing. How does that effect any common working man?!? This trial was just one big show so citys wouldnt burn. 😒
So is it too late to indict all the cops that have killed multiple people the exact same way now, and in the future? or is this just a one off news special
Justice
You do the crime.  You do the time.
Nevermind the mob of blm threatening to destroy our cities...   this is a gross case of jurist intimidation.  Oh... and funny how Maxine can very intentionally tell a crowd to riot, if they dont like the verdict.. and its not inciting violence. The double standards of democrats never ceases to amaze.
Jailbait
We got to wait 8 weeks for the sentencing it feels like an eternity
Circus Continues....
Justice finally served. It is sad that this officer showed no remorse during any off these proceedings. Mr Floyd never should have been treated like he did for a. $20 fake bill that he was given to purchase something for something else. Then to be tortured to death while pleading for his life. Maybe other officers will think twice before they play with peoples lives like they are not human. My son was a victim as well of false arrest and broken jaw.
Thy have discussed the conditions of this prolific theatre tricks, this is seemingly a facade and a well thought out display for fear of america condescending to a post lybian apocalypse at the mercy of BLM apologist.
Derek Chauvin in shock to realize he is a "victim" of his own racism...
Why he looking stupid like he not supposed to get in trouble for murder -_-
Why?  This man was on his stomach, hands cuffed behind him on the ground. Why did he have to lose his life?  Because you have some white supremacist and KKK on the police force. Though its never been brought up, it is true.  Sad world we live in.
Now what about the little girl shot and killed by the other cop
1:26 this is definitely going to become a meme 😂
His eyes just moving 👀😐👀🙄
🥳🥳🥳
How many years he was sentenced? That guy deserves a life time sentence
Judge , sentencing in 8 weeks  Chauv ,  I'm getting more than 8 wks ...?
I hope a black guy in the cel, make you feel the real pain as George Floyd as felt it..you nazi cop..
WE WILL MISS YOU LEGEND🙏🙏
Don't worry once it gets to an actual Court that's not judged by feelings, he will be acquitted.
We need to lock all these pigs up 🐷
Since when do they charge and convict on lower levels of felonious acts? It use to be that you were charged for the highest level of felony crime. Strange times indeed!
A politically motivated verdict. Imagine the riots if the verdict was different ! Racism works both ways.
Ladies and gentlman, we got him
Imagine the riots if he was acquitted...
He deserves everything he has got coming to him! He is a murderer!
THIS is a total mis-trial.  It's about race, and not about law!  The deliberations outside of court are one of a score for blacks.  THAT IS NOT JUSTICE !!!!!!
Do Chauvin have a wife and children? If so, how did they handle this last year, and did they distance themselves from him or his actions?
Being an officer and watching this trial, I’d just have to get myself a new job. I saw what this man did, and it wasn’t just, and he did literally kill a man in the street. I know I saw, but having this job would put you in situations where bad things are more likely to happen and if I was an officer that fact would scare the shit out of me and make me get a different job, wouldn’t have taken this one to begin with lol. Not only could you end up killed, what if you accidentally hurt someone else and got a charge for trying to do a stupid job just to keep bills paid and food on your table? It just wouldn’t be worth the risk for me. Either way glad they made him pay the price for his actions. Had he took his knee out of Floyd’s neck when Floyd said he couldn’t breathe, when other pedestrians started panicking for Floyd, begging for the officer to remove his knee, or when Floyd had stopped moving and breathing all together, I think he wouldn’t have been given a murder charge. Yet he didn’t, he just stayed with his knee still on his neck even after the paramedics arrived, so here he is with his murder charges. I’m glad he didn’t just get to walk away from this, I couldn’t imagine Floyd being my family member. Then people bringing up Floyd’s past, I mean seriously? Just because someone has a violent past doesn’t justify killing them today, especially when they’ve been locked up and served time for that crime already. I’m just glad his family got him some sort of justice, even though it won’t bring him back, it’s making a huge statement to officers all over the US, and it’s changing history as we speak. When books teach of this pandemic, Floyd’s name along with Rayshard Brooks will be brought up along with it, just watch. Kids will learn of them in their history books before we know it.
No way it was going to be any different due to fear from the jury and the people in the state the trial was held.
This shit was set up tho was meant to cause division its all part of a bigger agenda. The part I hate is how they make it a white / black issue thats bs.  Its a policing problem that effects all of us. Its the culture within certain police departments and leadership issue. This may be a shock to the msm but there are more races then white / black but the media seems to think those 2 are the only ones that matter. Now thats being racist. The media cause more damage to blacks than anything. They instill this mentality in them that their problems are more important than anything or any1 else problems. That causes resentment from all other races. The funny thing is majority of white people don’t really have an issue with blacks but most other ethnic groups really do hate blacks. I have friends from many different regions of the world and the ones who talk most crap of blacks are not white Americans. Im not those crazy de fund the police dumb ass liberals but there is a problem with policing in this country. There are many good cops out there but they bring this crap onto themselves with that never rat on a cop us vs them mentality. Im white n asian but been harassed many times by cops who think im hispanic. They always change their attitude when they realize im not hispanic so yeah absolutely cops profile and assume a stereotype when they see someone. The biggest problem with the police are police unions. In most other labor forces management is separate from labor. Management is most often non Union. In police unions they are all union. This creates a lack of accountability. The first step in improving police department should be to separate the leadership from non leadership. This way leadership can be held accountable and forces them to hold their subordinates accountable for fear of losing their jobs. That just my 2 cents. With all that being said people are individuals and im not trying to group anyone by race or ethnicity. Im just being general.
KARMAS a BITCH 😆😆😆👍👍👍
They should of let George family member put the cuffs on him.
Wait until the appeals process. Unfortunately the jury is going to be used to create a mistrial due to the media doxing their identities, and the jury not being sequestered. They have a very good case for appeal. Think of it this way. If you lived in that city, could you avoid the influence of Floyd? How many people see it on the walls and public transit, or just on their smartphones without looking on their social media feeds? Then you have it on TV shows, music, etc Let's not forget politicians. The judge even allowed it to be on the record as grounds for a appeal plus the prosecution doing a bit of misconduct. My point is this is far from over.
Should be NOT guilty! George floyd was a junkie!
This shit will happen again. Probably soon.  Not much ever changes.
Every time the judge read a guilty verdict and watching Chauvins facial response for some reason I kept hearing the Law and Order: Dong Dong....lol
Thank God
George Floyd, drug addict and serial criminal. It was gonna happen sooner or later. Served 5 years in prison for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Not an angel.  The policeman should be put away for 15 years max, but a whole lifetime? Scapegoating, mob rule and ignorance. Media and wokedom don't air the information and a man loses his life. All done to calm riots.
F E N T A N Y L
when will fentanyl and all the other fucking drugs be charged for the actual murder ?
I wonder if this didn't have so much controversy behind this case whether he would of been charged or got away with it I'm thinking the latter...
Justice won today.
Commandment #6: " Thou shall not kill!". God had the final word!
If he didn’t get found guilty we would of turnt the world into a triangle rot in jail
white privilege card got revoked
WE GOT JUSTICE
This cop had tons of abuse report under his belt, it was just a matter of time.
Virtual signalling again. So Bad when a criminal high on drugs and heart condition from his drug abuse that overdosed weeks before out committing crime get accidentally killed whilst resisting arrest gets put on a pedestal and police man doing his job gets found guilty of a crime that you shouldn’t get found guilty of. No one is talking about Justine diamond when she was killed by a black cop in the same city.   Virtual signalling again
A prison is a cops worst nightmare...even worse than death....nothing like getting cooped up in a room  with men personally damned by you...
I don´t want to be in his shoes. He´ll be marked murderer for life.
No emotion, he knew it and apparently looking forward too doing nothing for the next 12 or so years just in time for retirement, if he can survive prison 🤔
Let’s just pray that sentencing goes good and if so any appeals he makes gets denied! I guarantee when he was found guilty his lawyer told him not to worry because he can fight this on appeals! Once things calm down with the public in the US let’s pray he doesn’t win any of these appeals! Because you know he’s gunna file!  Today’s a good day! I’m praying this guilty verdict will be upheld!
Take care because in life you never know where you're going to end up
Solitary confinement won't save him from the fact that other inmates will prepare and deliver his meals. They will make his food "special." I can tell u this from "inside" knowledge.
Am black but am sorry ,I feel sorry for him.What made him do that? I don't think he intended to kill him.May God forgive him..Am sure he is sorry
he will be out in two years for good behavior
What a shithole.
He not finna have a nice time in prison🥵
Who knew you could be guilty of unintentional homicide and intentional homicide at the same time! Anyone who thinks the jury came to this decision other than the fact that they were threatened is a moron. The judge should have sequestered them, and kept them anonymous from the beginning.
Also look forward to watching his fellow cop buddies be sentenced to prison, which they will be. There’s no place for racist cops that feel as if they can murder unarmed people of color with impunity while they hide behind their badges like the cowards that they are. Federal and state laws MUST be changed in order to reform a system that has long been steeped in systemic racism. Enough is enough.
They only found him guilty to avoid riots. Don’t let this deceive you into thinking they actually care.
Hahahahahahhahahahahahahhahah
I HOPE ALL COPS LEARN FROM THIS.
He was so obviously guilty. The jury did a good job
Don't drop the soap 😒🙄
We are supposed to drop our humanity and become docile and obedient the instant some other human who went to advanced gym class to get a badge tells us to.  This is unnatural and often undignified, so they are trained in pain compliance and lethality to guarantee immediate obedience.  This is life on every street for every man woman and child. We need to be a country FULL of people who are better than this. Who deserve better.  Order at all costs is worse than slavery, no slave is asked to believe his toil is for his own benefit.
I thought it would be too much to watch but with each yes from the jury were weights lifted off my chest. George Floyd deserved better but this is the LEAST we can do
Why am I feeling sorry for him? You can see how much I hate this guy by all my old comments but now I am feeling sorry, it started to change when I found out it was not him who said "get up and get in the car"
justice is served.
Dude looking like 😬...what the hell.
That's not the guy from the George floyd video.
Two birds with one stone. A dirty cop (chauvin) and a worthless violent criminal (floyd) off the streets. Justice.
Let's not let Amy Klobuchar off the hook ... as the County Prosecutor, she ignored one dozen allegations of excessive force by Derek Chauvin and chose to not prosecute him!
Great Job Erick Nelson! You had a hunch that the jury was watching the case through their phones and computers, and instead of using that opportunity to sweet talk them indirectly, you instead tried to take away privileges from them. Pissing them off.. while making Chauvin look even guiltier and hiding secrets.    Prosecution always spoke to the jury as if they were BFF's and connected with them as if they were already part of their own team. And as bad as you tried to paint out Floyd to be they were never intimidated by anything the jury could find on their own. Great Job Nelson🏆🏆
Yay
He gonna get his cheeks clapped
Hope he rots in hell!! And everyone who supported him rot in hell as well!!!!!!
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
They don’t even need a trial. The video is enough evidence. You clearly see the man murder the poor guy.
Will he be murdered in American prison?
Trust me HE LOOKS LIKE he doesn't kno what's hit him  HE FEELS LIFELESS  his freedom taken away  He will never see the streets again  He will never walk down to the local shop  He will never see his home or bed again  Trust me HE FEELS EVERY BIT OF IT  AND WHAT A HORRIBLE THOUGHT
Thank goodness the Jury used logic and evidence to come to a fair verdict.
3:41 lizard people confirmed
I think that here there is nothing to celebrate the victim was not a saint and was a victim if of a police negligence but followed by a disrespect for the laws and police procedures and if they get to see they are seen in many recent cases such as that of a young man  that when they were going to arrest him for being requested, he pushed the police, got into his car to flee and that caused an involuntary error by the officer due to the speed of the moment in using the real gun instead of the electric one, there is no need to fear for  tell the truth, tell whoever hurts, whoever protests, where I come from I faced the negligent mafia of the motorized Whips of society that did not respect the channel for motorized vehicles in Indian line as we say there they circulated through the fast channel and there were so many that  They did not allow those of us who were outside in the car to be able to deviate to take an exit and if by mistake and their fault an accident occurred between all of them they fell on you I always faced  them despite the consequences because I am one of those who think that when you are right you should not cower.  In the case of the United States here, something is happening that outrages me and that is to see that just like the motorists in Venezuela do that they do not respect even a woman to demand that they pay for an engine that was damaged because of the same in-law of the motorcycle itself with threat of  even hit him or destroy his car, here the same pattern is being repeated defending people who do not respect the law police procedures let the police do their job and leave those stupid excuses of racism because the same thing that happened to george floyd,  It has happened to hundreds of thousands of American citizens of white Chinese or Latino race and these communities do not threaten society with looting among other things or go out to protest for them less if they are not saints such as a history of drugs or drug trafficking, etc.  Because it is the right thing to do, the only thing to do if demand is some punishment or compensation for police negligence, but what I am trying to say is that the black race in the US, on the day that it abides by the law, leaves  n to speak beaten and stop trying to hit or flee from the police authorities at a given moment these things also in GREAT MEASURE will stop happening who does not owe it does not fear it and whoever owes it and knows it, should avoid fleeing even if they are  responsible because they are doing as in Venezuela that the law of motorized gangsters prevails over the law heat that with the government of Maduro the law is over but it is still a good example of what you will be responsible for continuing to celebrate without awareness of the cases  and better reflect and detail better before acting, I hope they do it for the good of all and society and that the law does not feel self-conscious before the black race just for fear that they do not like their verdict, whether it is fair or not ...  Amen
Watching this clip gives me so much joy! I've watched it so many times. 😁
I know he had done wrong but at this point of time, I could only say sorry for him. I guess he would be one of the best person on planet when he comes out from jail. 😔😔
Lol Derek looked a little baffled there after hearing the verdict.
When the verdict was read the arrogance just fell from his face he was very arrogant. The whole trial he just knew he was going home but when they got to reading that verdict his eyes were like 👇👈👐👎👍👆👉👉👆👇👈👉👈👉👇👆👐👐👍👎😂😂😂 he is now drinking from the cup of the wrath of God!!!
His face while the verdict was being read.......he couldn't believe what he was hearing.....face like wow they actually convicted ME! YES, AND YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING TO YOU!! 💯🎯
If 👀 was a person
Funny that this is not trending...
Yesssss
That's the verdict w/o bail, what's the term of sentencing? If there is an appeal, will it be considered and approved?
Of course he was, no matter if he was innocent they were not gonna have him walk because riots would happen in every city so basically  Dude was delt a horrible hand no matter how you look at it.
This was a verdict by a politically manufactured jury, and not representative of the whole country.  Just in case you wondered, if there were to be a general referendum on the outcome, I suggest that he would  be found to be innocent.   He was doing his job!    Anyway, time for talking is long over.   Either you start the civil war that is taking so fucking long to come, or just give up, and admit your country is an invaded shithole.
Excellent!!!!! 👏👏👏😍
ok COPS. You got it. Let the criminals just run off, all drugged up, and let them do whatever. Maxine Watrers calling for violence and a pigs head on a jurors lawn, and a burned down church didnt affect this right?
After the verdict,  eye  movements anyone?
Sad day for America
This country dodged Martial law! It was a real possibility!
He is a cop, no way he is going to a prison for actual criminals, he will possibly be taken to several of the US s prison facilities that only hold other officers charged with different crimes
Welp!
derek still wins, he's alive, fentanyl floyd is not 1:0 for derek
If floyd was white this guy would not spend a second in jail
Man I’m telling y’all they ain’t sending dude to no prison with Black People, they know better. Cuz we gon give him what he deserves, the Death sentence.   Probably going to a predominately white prison with hella guards by his side...
I love how this is being televised all over the world but its an American issue. This is a police officer using excessive force  to subdue a known criminal. Was his intent to kill a man? I don't know. Should he be punished? 100%. Does this need to be a world issue? No. The amount of racial incitement by the media is disgusting and this is the issue. People crying 😢 over the verdict but they will move on to next 'trend'. They think they're 'woke' but you are playing the game they want you to play. If you truly believe in justice then the rioters and looters need punishing for the violence they created last year.
Great result  for the family and to the BLM movement,,
Ha ha poor boy cha cha cha chauvin lol
DC spent his whole career locking people up, now he gets the live with all of them forever
I don't know why he did it but I don't think he wanted to do it
This is a result of vengeance this man will remember his actions for the rest of his Natural Life. He will not be in a happy place mr. Floyd is may he find Mercy in the eyes of God
I hope this man gets the worst treatment in prison. Make him feel the pain George went through!
White privileged card is getting expired
Good
A Great day for justice What you witnessed was a murder in plain sight, no ifs or buts about it Now the murderer is going to jail and America rejoices
*What does it say* about how well Black life has not been protected, when George *Floyd's help* came from a *girl* who used her *camera* *under threatened attack by violent Police,* because she was recording George Floyd being murdered by Police?   And *she is heart-broken* because that was and IS *all she could do* to help; standing nearby like *only watching,* when she was *powerless* to stop Police from murdering George.  Where are our protectors really? *Who are they?*  While we have to *protect ourselves* and the *Government Is attacking us* because we are being *forced to protect ourselves* from our government protectors.   *Yes!!!!!! Ride the coat-tails* of this young girls courage. Because *Black life is in danger* by the lack of protection we have been getting *from government lawmakers, cops, and organizations.*   Black people are *armed with cameras* and under *cops threatened attacks.*  And after using her courage to try and *record a true record* catching our protectors murdering us.       Then all the *so-called protectors" come out and stand in *front and pretend* to act like they did something; besides being *caught in the act* of failing and attacking us.    Watch it *here they come* now!  *If only* George Floyd could give *thanks to the young girl,* and they could be together *now* and *give thanks to The Most High YAH.*  But George is dead.
All you had to do was do you job the right way. You could of been drinking a glass of wine and eating a slice of pizza instead your going to jail.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤❤❤❤❤
Chauvin will be placed in special (soft) confinement for his safety during his stay and provided with extra conveniences thanks to the tax payers.
Guilty Guilty Guilty an anybody that dont hinl
Good luck America, as you are going to need it . This is going to be the norm intimidating at its best.
Finally, justice is served for Black American. I can’t help but wonder, how about the racism towards Asian American? Spanish American?
The false cop got what he freaking deserve.
God bless us all justice for all
I would love to read his mind if he would know that hundreds of millions of people around the globe despise him
Nah, this man already knew they were going to convict him.
Typical Psychopath (Military + Police Recruits)... Probably abused by his family!!... Happens all the time
Look how he was looking when they read the verdict, his eyes told the whole story 👉🏾 I KNOW YA’LL DID’NT FIND ME GUILTY 👈🏾 🤣😂🤣😂 oh yes they did 🤣💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Justice has been served
My favorite part of the trial 😃🙌
I hope the final sentencing won't be light ... would lead to some serious protests in the US. And rightly so.
Why did Chauvin not get off Floyd's neck? The video suggests he's being contemptuous towards the witnesses begging him to stop. Did he continue smothering the life out of George Floyd to show the witnesses the power a little man had over a big powerful black man? Chauvin will never be honest about why he didn't stop..he'll remain in denial, but from what I saw, Chauvin was focused on looking powerful over his prey.
There was no other possible verdict. Guilty as
Derek Chauvin  looks around in disbelief. He  was used to get away committing, torture and murder, but this time he was caught. One less evil 👿 in the police force.
While reading the verdict his eyes were saying.... I don't understand, I thought I was white??.
Finally we see justice doing its best against the criminals police officers who think they can get away with abuse, tortures and murder of the citizens who pay their fat salary.
He like but your horror I’m white
He probably gone commit suicide! He looks a little unstable! He did the crime now he gotta do the time.
But but but I’m white with a badge, this couldn’t be, no no no I want a retrial.. Nah buddy you’re about to walk the green mile and meet your roommate Bubba, whose going to treat you real nice and love you long time. Bye sir 👋🏾
Let's keep the cameras rolling 📸on all cops
We need TRUMP . GO TRUMP 2024 WE LOVE YOU.
I am sure the inmates will give him a very warm welcome and hopefully a lot more...
Now to pick up the soap! Good luck from uk
@ 2:32 when judge asks jury if the verdicts are  true and correct you then see that POS look over just  to see if they have made a mistake lmfao NO MOFO they hadn’t made a mistake you’re QUILTY QUILTY QUILTY Oh lord oh lord I’m crying right now 😭😭😭 finally Justice for Mr Floyd R.I.P and Congratulations to his family friends and people who fought for this BLM ✊🏿 ✊🏾 ✊🏽
Idk why but he seems so unbothered, there's no remorse in him, nothing. So horrible
May God have mercy on his soul. But he's arseholes done that's for sure
Good u are guilty
Today our lives matter thanks to Beden government.
The look on his face was priceless buddy thought he was gonna beat this case.... I bet he wishes he could take back his actions
@1:25 The moment this dirty cop starts to realize his life is over! This is karma.
❤❤❤
Floyd got justice...  he’s dead
Thank you Heavenly Father 🙏🙏
The courts are partisan. There's no way their going to embarrass Pelosi rushing to the side of BLM in the city of Minneapolis and going down on her knee to swear undying allegiance to BLM'S cause.
He did not kill anyone. It was Floyd's spooky friend's parked up in their partner in crime's astral body who stopped his heart. They knew the consequences their action would provoke in corrupt American politics and that it would lead to the democrats hi jacking the death to support violence against the President Trump administration.
This was 1st degree murder wtf
Race War
#JusticeForFloyd
When you know what you did was wrong "Chauvin" the arrogance in the video from your camera to your arrogance in the courtroom I didn't expect any reaction from a coward "Chauvin".
Ho many years in prison ?
The look of shock and bewilderment on Derek Chauvin's face when the verdict is read out. "But we stormed the Capitol!"
1/4 officers in jail/prison If we can get one, we can get them all
Don't expect a 40 years sentence because he hasn't been previously convicted   He won't get the maximum penalty
What would have happened to the jury if they found him innocent, it doesnt bear thinking about, violence is the justice in the USA today, mob rule
he is not  a criminal.......and he knows it.....
Weird feeling, almost sympathy knowing that a persons life has now changed forever as they knew it. However, because he felt like he was protected by his badge, he took a life that could have been avoided. Sad but wouldn't want a cop like him on the streets influencing other cops
These comments prove that some people only believe in justice as long as POC are out of the picture. Chauvin being guilty is the first sign of justice. And America is lucky that POC are looking for justice, and not revenge.
That's right chauvin, everyone's hands in front, yours in the back lmao indeed!
The sacrificial lamb.
Finally!!!! It ain't over yet y'all the rest of them need to get theirs to
Why does he look shocked??? That’s the most emotion he’s EVER shown.
At this moment home boy realized he f**led up , it's a wrap dude enjoy prison
I loved watching this
Sad times. He should not have been found guilty.
And that Mr "officer" is what we call JUSTICE. BY THE FUCKING BOOK!!!!
Finally, America! 🇺🇸
GOT EM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Judge did not like Chavin.
The head dirt bag is heading to prison for awhile... get some of that prison justice coming for you... let's see if he can still breathe ...
One down....thousands upon thousands to go...yet the public seems content. They feed you crumbs and you take it. Tomorrow it’s starting all over again. So the struggle continues....
May he rot in prison 🎉
This trial should have been held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as the jurors knew anything short of 'guilty verdict' would burn Minneapolis down to the ground! Maybe other cities, too?! Chauvin was innocent. Mr. Floyd’s blood was oxygenated' to the tune of 98% when paramedics arrived - he didn't suffocate! It was drug overdose! Below oxygen level of 60% it starts being critical and the person is in need of ‘oxygenation’ - Mr. Floyd was at 98% so no suffocation.
Bass Hassan haaaaa haaaaa
Too bad they don't put them in general population he lost about 9 minutes and 24 seconds
He showed no remorse. I have no sympathy for this man
Hopefully he lands in a prison with the majority of the prisoners being coloured   Sayonara boy
Weisel
Pig
Rot in hell
He gonna find out what a shank is.
He’s saying “incorrect” verdict?
Welp, there goes the rule of law.
Ok now ghasline maxwell
Witness protection
God is good
Sad day for the justice system in America.
Rest In Peace, George Floyd.
Flo6d was a criminal
Justice got served. Take that mask off and let us see the horror on his face!
The ENTIRE WORLD saw this man take the life of George Floyd, and from the beginning of him killing him, through the trail....smh. Derek Chauvin showed absolutely ZERO emotion, ZERO remorse.  When the judge read that verdict, his heart was racing, eyes were blinking excessively, honestly I didn't know a psychopath was even capable of blinking fast. He was really shocked like a dummy.  He should be scared and glad he showed that expression of being scared.  🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼❤❤❤RIP GEORGE FLOYD!!still so very very sorry this happened to you 😥
Wow when a man calls for his mother it’s over and that’s what George Floyd did
Don't worry my people from the caucus mountains you get your chance to riot when the next Stanley cup is won or when trump gives another war cry of fake claims.
Thank god now how did these other white people get away. block people get convicted of the back this was something that was obvious from the beginning u can’t take someone’s life
Justice 🙏
God rest George Floyd's soul🙏justice was served 💯
And the media dont speak jack shit about the white dude who got killed by the cops exactly the same way as poor old floyd, probably wount get a foot note in the papers
Alot of sick fucks in the comment section
The fucker looking like he don’t know what he did. Imagine doing what made the WORLD riot , no one supports you
Im going to play NWA F#&@ the police.
Yeah! yeah ✊ the jury got it right.The Attorneys General team nailed it from the very start of the trial .they nailed it When they said: use your common sense believe your eyes ,what you saw.  Wow so power. Thanks to all the police &  police of chief"When Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy," Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo testified. "It is not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics or values." Wow. That is so rare for their own police department to go up against when their own that took courage. thanks for all the witnesses that were there that came forward seeking truth and justice for the victim. and 9 year girls that said get off his neck..The whole trial was raw and powerful from the beginning . Yelling out 📢loud  yeh, yeh, yeh, that jury got it right. Guilty guilty guilty on all three counts .NOW LETS GO GET THE OTHER TWO OFFICERS ::Former officer Kim Potter allegedly mistook her handgun for a stun gun.AND THE OTHER OFFICER  Eric Stillman’s the Chicago police shooting of a 13-year-old boy ADAM TOLEDO shows the youth appearing to drop a handgun and begin raising his hands less than a second before an officer fires his gun and kills him.
Is anybody  looking at this man not even  a sign of emotion dame  life in prison would be to good for him
Dear Kyle rittenhouse you are next, I hope this keeps you up at night
He is the ruthless murderer and he deserves the verdict and hopefully will get a long prison sentence.  God help him.......
Please forgive Derek Chauvin. I respectfully ask Floyd's family to forgive Derek Chauvin for sake of humanity and let him be released from the jail. Thank you so much.
How can you be convicted of both accidently killing someone and also intentionally murdering someone? The definitions of manslaughter and murder contradict each other. Is this a kangaroo court?
I think we should arrest all the blm rioters that have killed innocent black people during their riots
Lol, he’ll be out in 6 months and do 1 year house arrest after that. It’s no big deal.
He will walk free when this will be overturned for stuff like Waters comments for example. 2 counts for murder is a joke, manslaughter maybe yes. The jury is woke and this was a political trial.  They just had to calm down the mob for now
There was no way he was going to get a fair trial so he already knew this was coming.
Prediction:  he gets 10 years. Writes a book and earns millions. See all those notes he was taking?  Did u think that was for fun?  Nope. I’m glad he was convicted so we can show that NO COP IS ABOVE the law. But let’s look at the laws. DeSantis just passed a Bill in Florida that u can run someone over with ur car if u are a protester. So much needs to be done in this messed up country. But at least today JUSTICE was served.  Say his name...GEORGE FLOYD.
Its impossible that the jury was not aware of the threath of riots. They dont live on the moon. Nevertheless if justice has been done the verdicts have to be accepted.
He's just a sacrifice to quite down the black community in America. Because you never see cops go against cops.
I would love to have the cop that sent me to prison in their with me.. Mop wig and a bed sheet dress.... Who's the bitch now pmsl
Derek was innocent, America supports whyt hating naz!s
It take 10 minutes to kill George Floyd and it take the real Judge 10 minutes to read the Guilty charge of Officer Derek Chauvin. What a sad life.☹️
His eyes darting around in confusion. This person is truly sick. A person with No Remorse. Give him the Full 75.
Congratulations to the black community  I as a white person will always stand with you together as 1 . RIP George floyd
I can't  wait until the race war comes and the biased Biden and  Administration  are put out of office.
Freee chauvinnnn
Why is there 492 dislikes?
Thrown under the bus , Just to appease the "No good violent trash".
I wouldn't like to be him....
He took notes during the entire trial ..so i was waiting for him to write down guilty on all three charges on his little note pad 🤣🤣
Do you see how quickly the police were ready to lie and cover up a murder? They put out that statement, that piece of bad fiction ready to sweep that man's murder under their already dusty carpet.  But the people said "no." The people said, "like hell, you are going to murder a man in cold blood in front of our eyes and think you are going to keep us silent." They took their pain, their disbelief, their anger, their truth into open court and dumped it into his lap. Rest in peace George Floyd.
All because a 17 year old girl got her phone out.
he's gonna see a lot o necks
The maximum is 75 years, what's the minimum?
Just wait till these people really need the law ain't going to be none get you some of that
Guilty
look at that look on his face
Why can't the black people of this country see that the problem is the black and white people of this country don't think they have to comply is nobody brave enough to call out the real problem of what's going on in this country when did people not have to comply and not have to answer to the law hell just tell all American people that they don't have to answer to the law's of the land he was found guilty of doing what he was trained to do let's show people what has happened to hundreds of law officer's in this country when they didn't react fast enough and lost their life the police officer's in this country should quiet and then they will see how its going to get bad bad bad bad just watch America
Everyone is celebrating when he's in protective custody. And when it's possible he only has 30 years prison
A lot of upset people outside the court. They wanted to burn the streets. Just shows the mentality of the people of Minneapolis. How many would have been arrested or killed if an innocent verdict was brought forward.  If the streets were burning, the police should surround the city and slide the rioters in and force them into the flames. But as a guilty finding was brought forward, the city can breathe. But no thanks to the people. The jury saved a lot of people's distress. Shame on the people who think black lives matter. ALL lives matter you Muppets
I didnt expect any other verdict....regards Tony
Justice
YES ...YES....YES...YES...YEEEEESSS.KARMA GETS HIM ...HE MUST PAY FOR TAKING GEORGE FLOYD LIFE ...NOW HIS SOUL IS RESTING IN HEAVEN ...GOD TAKE CARE GEORGE FLOYD...RESTS IN PEACE  AMEN ....HOPE NO MORE KILLINGS FROM THE POLICE ...THEY SUPOSE TO TAKE CARE OUR SAFETY NO TAKING LIVES WE ARE SONS OF THE SAME HOLLY GOD ...FOR GOD THERE ARE NO SKIN COLORS WE ARE BROTHERS..
On the ITV news YouTube video of the verdict it has 225k views. And they expect you to believe out of THAT MANY people the video only collected 600+ dislikes? Go check it out they are literally purging dislikes from videos about this. When our opinions are being silenced you should be very concerned. Also I wonder why a lot of these videos have comments turned off? Must not want to hear all the opinions that don’t fit the narrative...Anyways thanks for letting us comment
These white officers are conditioned to think they can kill black people without consequences  That's why he pleaded not guilty he thought he would get away with it...the shock in his eyes prove this
He looks like he as about to shit his pants enjoy jail
It'll be overturned and you'll be crying and looting.
The Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman is a racist and would never have charged any of the cops, had the tape not hit world news! Let us never forget: George Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died after 3 police officers pinned him down, one with his knee on his neck for more than 9 minutes, while George Floyd was pleading “I can’t breathe”. His lifeless body was removed from the scene by paramedics and taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead!  All 4 cops have now been arrested for murder! Derek Chauvin 4/20/19, found guilty for 2nd Degree Murder, 3rd Degree Murder, and 2nd Degree Man Slaughter, for which he should spend the rest of his life in prison!  Now it is time for the other 3 to stand trial for murder! It is time to end qualified immunity!
All cops should quit thier jobs.....18 years of service down the drain for a drug addict and a criminal ....sad
Whos laughing now bitch !!!
Free the man
Weird see up murder and case...our country is weird to set things up like this
Political decision. The whole world knows that. It won't bring any peace.
I want to feel for this dude but the cold smugness on his face just reminds one that he's  getting justice handed to him for the murder of a defenseless person
America has nothing but cowards in positions of power
He thought he was going to get the George Zimmerman walk free card
This guy isn't going to have a fun time in prison
Guilty is not enough!! It depends on what punishment he will get!!
Mob rule
So is he going to jail?
If he was really surprised, he may have had a sad reaction. He doesn't appear to have reacted much to it.
Surely this guilty verdict will smackdown Mr Eric Nelson's confidence. His ''reasonable police officer"' is now a guilty murderer. This is grand justice and it has been served meticulously and swiftly.
Guess the justice system in America is dead. When you can get an innocent man convicted by intimidating the jury. Am I glad I live in Europe.
EVERY PRISONER IN THE COUNTRY is watching this and loving it.
God Bless the Great Human being Judge AND ALL The great Human Beings of the Jury ; let THIS Vercict be a LESSON to the Alien Killers in DISGUISE  Living among us and killing Humans , BURN these Alien KIllers once and for all,
Lovely to see that now it’s a crime to be a cop, that sure helps things Professor. (Sarcasm) If you can’t actually breath, you can’t say you can’t breath. But clearly truth doesn’t matter. Leftist Libtards have no conception of reality. George Floyd was on drugs, he died because of those drugs, he just made sure (being the criminal he was) that the cops got involved. Apparently him dyeing from an overdose, means the cop is guilty. Please explain how that makes sense. O wait that’s right, the Libtards want to get rid of all police, That’s right. Excuse me I forgot, Liberals think there Gods an are above the law. You have to love Liberal privilege. Should we start burning the country’s cities down now, o wait that’s what Liberals do.
The systemic racism in this country has to end. The cop graduated to murdering a black man in broad daylight with everyone watching because he was hardened to mistreating people with impunity over 19 years. This impunity has to end.
Holy shit that poor guy.
I’m sure in every prison in the country inmates are watching this trial.
Yes!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
hearing each member of the jury say yes is so powerful
You could literally see in his eyes the shock that the blue line gang hadn't protected him..after all the despicable acts he done in its name!
Chauvin took the life of an innocent man, after being found guilty they should deprive the life of Chauvin!
Off to oak park heights Derek. The way he was just looking at the camera with his hands in his pockets while murdering this man is just scary.
Furious George would have been dead from drugs within hours.  Chauvin is innocent
This guilty verdict was necessary. History didn't repeat itself this time and this cop obviously can't believe he was just convicted. Reality will set in once he hears those prison doors slam behind him as he enters a world where he no longer has a badge and gun to hide behind.
So should we THE PEOPLE let them know US citizen don't go by that Blue Shield code or by that white privilege....asking for people of color btw
No way!!! This is such a crime. He is not guilty in any way!!
I was watching this with a weird feeling in my stomach and my hands shaking but I almost lost faith in America but it came out great and I’m happy we all happy comrades now we hope it’s a good sentence
This is NOT justice.  Morality; what is ir right and wrong is decaying faster as days go by in the U.S.  Marks of the beginning signs of the end of an era.
This entire situation is just sad and should have never happened. So sad for all involved.
YES!!!!!! GOD BLESS DEMOCRACY
Hope he rots in jail forever
Thank God for each and every person who recorded this heinous  crime on their phone!!!! Proof of this murder! 💯 Have mercy! Blessings and condolences again to George Floyd's family.🕊
Alhamdhulillah finally the justices has been saved well.
His eyes went ↙️↘️⬇️↩↪↔️↕️↩↔️🔃↪↩
Don’t drop the soap 💀😂
The World held its breath in this moment and let out a collective sigh.  This is not the end, it’s the beginning.  Be careful what you teach your children.  This is where they may end up.
Floyd family 27 Million richer and only cared about their family member now they got the money, when he was alive they never gave two turds
There could be no other verdict otherwise America would have been burned to the ground . Crime will rise now ....police won’t remove their guns from their holsters . Chauvin while guilty has an element of sacrificial lamb about him and Biden was absolutely wrong to contact the family and express his opinion on what the verdict should be .
If George had been white you would have never known his name. If George had been a Trump supporter or conservative they would have celebrated and cheered, black or white
justice serves right!!!! 😊
He was innocent
Got emm
THANK GOODNESS!!! FOR ONCE The justice has properly been served! Now let's get all the cops responsible for black lives wrongfully taken, like Breonna Taylor!!!! Thank goodness!!
He still shows no remorse
his eyes be like 👀👁👀👀👁👀👁👀👀👁👁👁👀👁👁👀👁
Hold a pregnant lady at gun point???? Pay with fake money???  Be a criminal..... Resist law enforcement. It's ok.... They will hold pictures of you. Dam my life is messed up. Come in this is a joke right???
This is what blows my mind about law enforcement of today...they choose EGO above all reason and morality. Qualified immunity needs to be done away with.
Let's face it folks, as harsh as I may sound, the only reason why he was tried and convicted,  turned on by his fellow officers and thrown to the wolves( and he deserved it) is because he went against police norms when he killed Mr Floyd. By that I mean if he had used a gun and shot him in the back or chest to murder him it would have been  normal police behavior and they would have found a way to justify what he did. This verdict in no way fixes the problem with the pandemic of police brutality against people of color. But man did it feel good to see justice served. To the good cops out there,  thank you for your service.  To the bad ones,  take notice.
Free Derek!!
The inmates awaite him Ha that look on his face , :)
He blatantly killed him. That was very clear
Charge the other cops too for not doing a single thing as they watched this guy murder Mr. Floyd and if they can’t be charged they should all be fired for not upholding what they swore to do which is serve and protect.
How about giving money to all the people George Floyd committed crimes against????
Great, if only everyone else got put in the same spotlight instead of glorified for fucking each other up regardless of whether they're the same race or not...
With the money from the wrongful sue. Can the cities get paid for alllllllll the property damage??? Nope!!!! The BLM will have the Floyd's all dolled up saying he was the best human being. This is all a fraud. Family will be broke in two years or less.
Well America has set a dangerous president. BLM and Antifa have no fear of cops now... Prepare for more riots and looting because that cop was an innocent scapegoat. Any judge worth their salt would have seen that based on every evidence.
Those jurers are some real ones✋
California news on channel 9 throwing money at his place of death???? Since BLM matters. Let's see how much of that wrongful death money goes to the movement???? Nothing 🤣🤣🤣
I bet he got a cold feeling running through body when he heard that first “Guilty” verdict.  His eyes are twitching like crazy.
This won't stop Burn Loot Murder riots from happening.
He's eyes are saying..... Hahaha you guys can't loot now 🤣🤣🤣.  So alot of people are pissed off now that they can get stuff while blaming him.
I read a lot of the comments . I think there are a lot of crazy irrational white and black people in the United States . There is also too much pre trial publicity etc. in every high profile case . I even wondered if the Prosecutors could be overreaching in the Derek Chauvin case with some of the charges . Remember Casey Anthony and the fiasco the  Prosecutors  caused by asking for the death penalty ? Anyway a long time ago I questioned a retired Detective about the OJ Simpson case and that absurd n word questioning of Mark Fuhrman . . The Detective said , “ Maybe it was and really had nothing to do with the case but that boy ( Fuhrman) effed up ! “  No Chauvin didn’t intentionally set out out to kill George Floyd but he effed up !
He is so calm, not a tear.
All we ask for is accountability. If you kill or hurt someone, we want justice no matter what color you are
In my heart I knew this cop did wrong. As a nurse, as a father and as a reasonable man. Many times these incidents by police are justified and the crowd just wants blood, but not this time. What he did was wrong and I too think he is guilty.
I dont feel this was a fair judgement, not defending him but i dont think it was fair but oh well
I'm so glad this maniac is behind bars, but Im scared that the African American group will still find something to riot about.
Blm still not gonna stop.....
I think he thought he would be granted bail.....lol No.....put him in jail. He can say goodnight through glass. He never gave George the opportunity!
It's amazing how humble and meek these men become when you take away the uniform, badge and gun.   When You take that away they realize they are not gods,  their just men like the rest of us
Guilty? 2021 Opinions over evidence. Race conquerors evidence.
He's guilty, and hopefully scared. Maybe even wondering if being a smug power hungry coward for 9 minutes was worth it. Hopefully the rest of his  life is in lockup. George Floyd got his justice......but.... it won't bring him back or fully heal his family's heartache.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
YEAAAAAAAAAAASSSSS
Goodbye murderer! Red" prison life ain't no fairytale, George floyd put up his last fight I hope Derek spends the rest of his days and nights knowing what he did to an entire generation.  More importantly what George did for a generation as well as the indifference in humanity.  God bless you floyd family! Most importantly god bless you George  As a caucasian I thank you for opening my eyes to the cruelty and my ignorance there in! This is a fantastic day for all of us! Especially my black sisters and brothers out there! Us ignorant people hear you! We are listening.  And I personally have your back! God bless  Much love
You sure that is "Theeeee Derrick Chauvin?" He sure looked like an older man when he was kneeling on the Brother's neck.
Political verdicts? Doesnt matter. Both thugs are gone.
For those who think the police deserve this crap...i hope when youre home is invaded by a 200lb huge guy in the dark... no one comes to help you.  Keep it up.  Thats where we are headed.
I guarantee you as soon as he steps foot in prison. Automatic protective custody.
I think chauvin just snapped. Dealing with scum everyday for 20yrs must change a person. Too bad chauvin didn't get some therapy even 5 years ago. Unfortunately crimes going to be unbearable for the upcoming future so its time for citizens to stock up on guns and ammunition. Its not worth it for the police to show up for any crimes especially in black neighbourhoods. Unfortunately for black seniors and black children your lives are going to be very much at risk in the neighbourhoods that are run by gangs. Congratulations to the gangs, you will be able to go on an do what gangs do without any hassle. Bang Bang.
Chauvin is a hero.  We will never know how many women will not have a gun pointed at their unborn, nor how many store owners will not be robbed or stolen from.  We will never know how many people are now safe from this dead criminal, who cared not one whit about others.   This country is F'ed up..criminals celebrated while men n women w the toughest jobs become their victims.
THAT WAS NOT UNINTENTIONAL. WHITE PRIVILEDGE PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS VERDICT.
01:34  *“What do you mean my white privilege card has been declined?”*
A cop going to prison 😂😂😂
what a fucked a world. ppl cry when a "colored" man dies and then cheers and hollers like a female cartman when another "colored" man gets sentenced to death pretty much.
The butthurt of the alt-right is insane.
This is bull shit.. fuck George Floyd and anyone who supports him
What a beautiful site! Chauvin in cuffs and off to prison yahoo! It can only be improved by seening soneones knee on his neck for 9 and a half minutes! Love and prayers to the Floyd family from Australia
Whys he keep looking everywhere like someone is going to save him now? Lmao
Appeal this trial, Maxine's big mouth played a big part in this .
Watching the Defendant during closing arguments I thought he was sure he would be acquitted- let’s hope appellate procedure hols firm
I expected Derek Chauvin to celebrate this since he's safer in prison than outside
DAmn on Hitler birthday 😂🎂
Legends say Derek is now using his eyes to continue writing ✍️ he discovered his hidden talent to write with his 👀
We need justice like this in Trinidad and Tobago against our police officers
Great. Accountability is the first step towards justice.
Let the homie free he didn’t do shit
So there’s a lesson in this.. when cops act wild, cause enough civil uproar to send their ass to court... like Captain Planet said... The Power is Yours... the more noise you make... the better
*NEXT UP:* The "cop" who claimed she thought her gun was a taser....😒 *KIMBERLY  POTTER..... C'MON DOWN!!!!*
WE SMOKIN THAT CHAUVIN PACK TONIGHT BOYS
Jury# 11 Let's all say he's guilty so we can get this over with
So, Cities will not burning down to the ground at least tonight!!
So how many years he is going for ?
The verdict took my breath away.
Justice hell half tooth for half eye fuck the system
Now let's try OJ for murdering 2 white people by a non african racist jury
This shows what is wrong with the US justice system. No justice at all.
For all the white folks upset over this verdict and afraid of what awaits chauvin in prison,  listen guys, you have nothing to worry about.  Nothing at all.  The *BLACK CO's*  are gonna take REAL GOOD CARE OF HIM, most likely with the help of some *BLACK INMATES* if the CO's can pull it off. Chauvin will be fine. When he is released,  provided he isn't killed in prison,  he's gonna be so much *SWEETER....IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN* 😂🧁
Buckle up son your off to jail you douche bag !
Shout out to whoever was operating the camera. The framing of the clock at the end was on point.
451 racist were here
Some of the comments here are so deeply racist and horrifying. You people should be ashamed of yourself.
And what about his enablers?
do you guys want to see real racism?
I DON'T CARE WHAT COLOR YOU ARE WRONG IS WRONG AND THEY KILLED THAT MAN.  THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.  DON'T GET MAD BCZ WE ARE AS A PEOPLE FINALLY GETTING BACK AT  BENEVOLENT PEOLPLE DOING HARM TO ANYONE ELSE.  HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVES AND TBH MY PUNISHMENT WOULD'VE BEEN WORSE.  YOU KILLED A INNOCENT MAN FOR NO REASON AS WELL AS THE OTHERS THAT WE HAVE NOT MENTIONED.  IT NEEDS TO STOP AND IT WILL!! I'M JUST MAD IT TOOK YOUR LONG TO CONVICT A GUILTY MAN WHEN IT WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE.  THE OTHER OFFICERS NEED THEIR DAY ALSO IN JAIL WITH HIM.  LET THE INMATES TAKE CARE OF HIM.
The guilty verdicts on all counts saved walmart, and basically life as we know it.
Notice how he didn’t cry like a bitch like Floyd did when being handcuffed. Took that shit like a man
Why is he looking like hes confused😂
We now live in a society that the mob can get away with threatening the jury and using fear to manipulate the outcome. Blm has destroyed the American way and now allows criminals to get away with crimes. While ignoring plain evidence.  Disgusting. This is just mob justice or justice by popularity contest. Anyone that looks at the criteria to meet murder 2 or 3 easily understands the criteria was not met and these charges don’t apply. This is a shameful tragedy of justice.
He will try to appeal...and go for the lesser charge. But will it work if he is found guilty on all 3? But i love the unity
I'm glad they gave george floyd family justices may allah bless his family 😘
Those 451 people who thumbs down this video can go kick rocks!!
He'll get protected custody. The inmates will never be able to get him, unfortunately. 😐
Justice was served  for Mr George Floyd and his family. No one is above the law and that was  proven with this verdict.
As a punishment for his heinous crime an executioner gets to kneel on Derek Chauvin's pirate thuggish bad-apple neck perpetually forever until justice is served.
This guy is joining the neo-Nazi gang in prison.
Why are they wearing masks like they a doctor?
It’s not like the illegal drugs in Floyd’s system had anything to do with him dying 🤦🏻‍♂️
Finally justice has been served. Unfortunately, some looters and violent chaps are disappointed for they saw the opportunity to bring chaos to the USA.
Haha he really thought he was going to get off
The IRS should've been there
Get use to grabbing them ankles playa remember don’t the 🧼 ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Str8 Highway Robbery!!!!!!
chauvin i got 4 words for you before you go to jail    dont drop the soap
The one thing about all of this WRONGFUL conviction is that you won’t find the Republicans rioting over this because we know it’s BS! Know why that is? We aren’t whiny little bitches that throw temper tantrum’s when we don’t get our way. The Demtards keep on crying and threatening to stir up and cause more violence in this country. I’m glad Florida got smart and said if there are protesters surrounding your car, that you can’t be held liable for driving through the crowd. I’m sorry but I don’t deal to well with stupid people.
Good good bye bye murder
Beginning of destruction of Police. Next step - private companies gonna help with their private police/armies. And then we came back to Total Slavery of all Humanity. Good Job, plebs. Your kids won't forget what ya'll prepared for them. Stupid sheeps.
Let’s goooooooooooo
Ahhhhhh....the sound of angry white people in the comments section over the verdict.  Next to an orgasm,  I don't know what else could be better....ahhhhhh❤🖤💚😜😂
Don't drop the soap
Rot in hell Derek Chauvinist
Thats what you fu#n get LMAO punk muhhh fuhhhh
Each yes is like a nail in the coffin
Fuck you dereck
It shows cops are not above the law
This case was determined months ago because if they said not guilty the city would have been burned to the ground.
He was going to be guilty no matter what the lawyers said. No one on the jury would ever be safe again if they said no
Yes sir. His life is over. #JusticeIsServed
Yes yes yes and yes 👏🏽
Hate destroys..he too hateful n wicked n now he lost his freedom n ended another man's life.
Lol. He will get an appeal and win. That verdict was to calm the morons down that are burning our cities.
He shows no remorse but these are the people who become officers heartless unworthy human being now its your turn to feel George Floyd pain now u can't breath !!!!guilty guilty quilty
He aint going nowhere. I bet this was a false court session just to please the crowds, i bet he's in a protection program right now.
He's used to the police and law covering for each other by any means necessary. But what he failed to realize is that once you cause an international scandal... they aren't gonna do that anymore.
It’s sad of the idea that if this wasn’t so publicized his actions would’ve been swept under the rug...
the charges dosnt mean anything until sentencing , accidental death charge and manslaughter do not inflict harsh penalties for years and years. he is a cop yes did he intetnielny mean to kill George Floyd no but he is certainly at fault but it will be filed and handled accordingly
His eyes said it all! My privilege has expired and I don't know what the hell is going on! 😯
With ALL that's transpired over the past year, today I am PROUD to witness this verdict. Even after serving 23 years as a Marine I had lost faith in what this country called Justice. Thank you America for showing this sign of humanity. I am an Afrikan and Retired Marine living in America. Ma'at Hotep Ase'🇬🇼
I was CHOKEHOLD at Sturdy Memorial hospital attleboro, Massachusetts.  I can't breathe!!! Not very safe hospital!!
Least in this case the mob would have been right to ya know...mob
Is he really guilty or the Court has to give him a guilty verdit to make the public happy?
Mob law
There was no option. Convict or suffer a destroyed city
Thank you Jesus. I can breath now
George Floyds death was one of the most heartless ruthless cold blooded things we as a nation has had to witness. Chauvin literally had no regard for Floyds life, and acted like not only did he have a right to take his life, but he had that stupid defiant smirk on his face literally like he enjoyed killing him! I appreciate this guilty verdict and all... but he should have been charged with FIRST DEGREE MURDER... what he did was not only a gross abuse of power, but it was a monstrous act! His sentencing should match the crime!!! .... and his police buddies who just stood there and let Chauvin MURDER Mr. Floyd... all need to be on their way to jail to!!! ALL OF THEM... and especially the Asian cop... he was as bad as Chauvin!!!!
See those shifty eyes. That convict could not believe what he heard. All along he thought he was going to get away with murder scot free.
I hope they lock this ass hole under the prison!
It’s The head nod before the cuffs for me 😅5:00 say goodbye simple
LETS GOOOOO
Watching the George Floyd video and seeing him begging for his life being totally honest here and I wish I could go back in time and save George Floyd I would tackle the shit out of the officer that killed him ik I would get tased but in that moment I would give a fat rats ass
🅰️Epstein ℹ️didn’t kill himself 🅰️
🤣
Man took that like a g. 2 years he’ll be out on appeal!
He’s some ones woman now in prison
He knew he was guilty. He didn’t seem surprised. He expected it.
Also George Zimmerman should be found guilty.
Cops still underpaid and incompetent.   Nothing changes.
He’s getting killed in prison lol
The look on his face,  PRICELESS 😳
That’s so awesome he’s gonna be in jail for a long time
John walker got his shield tooken away and Derek chauvin is guilty to the charges 🙌🏾 justice
Wow
Hes a legend
https://youtube.com/shorts/RmKoz52SRhw?feature=share ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Praise God for justice. Great job jury.
✊🏻✊🏾🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
This man served the public for 19 years dealing with assholes on a daily basis. He was called into help other officers with a lifelong criminal that was resisting arrest and now he gets to spend the rest of his life in prison.  This country has become a fucking joke.
General population not a special place let punishment fit the crime
Chauvin will get his first viewing of the BBC in prison and I am not talking about the network
chauvin is innocent lmao
If he was found innocent, that town would have been a pile of ash by morning
The day trump ruined America! F that guy for what he did! Terrible!!! Have fun in the cell!
Pogggggggggg
It didn't Hit him until his Bond was revoked 🤣😂
Kid movin his eyes like that’s not what I payed u for “ Ur honor I object
Wheres blm rioting and looting tonight for thier celebration?
Just glad it ain’t me #beatdacase
Let this be a warning to all you fake cops hiding behind a real badge this kind of behavior will not be tolerated
Time to load up on guns and ammo. Pretty soon the police will not be able to help when ever your homes broken into because of cases like this.
C.Os will make sure his cellie is someone he arrested..
LMAOAOAAOAO DONT DROP THE SOAP
Praise God
Justice is over in USA.
This is not about racism , but about respect for human lives!! Not even nurses aides, nurses, or doctors get strong protection compared to the police. Time for police unions to be dismantled. Mostly Caucasian men who are the leaders of the unions , if it was more diverse with black men and women and other minorities this situation wouldn't of occurred
Good, for decent and humane American citizen's on all spectrum's.
Leaked video from CCP. China CCP is the enemy causing division and racial hate among Americans.  CCP's strategy according  to Jin Can Rong  金灿荣 ~ foreign affairs expert  中国人民大学国际关系学院副院长。 "苛政比老虎还要区猛" 5 "Evil Tricks" of the CCP.  中共“国师”金灿荣自曝 “邪招” 称将美国管起来 5 Strategic Plans of the CCP to control America:  1. Control the U.S. elections.  2. Deceive the U.S. on the South China Sea and win the strategic advantage of encircling Taiwan in the Western Pacific  3. Actively create multiple enemies for the U.S., even in the U.S. backyard (causing racial hate and division among Americans). Make friends with U.S. enemies like North Korea, Iran, and Russia.  4. Deeply infiltrate the U.S., thus making the U.S. internally confused and unable to watch out for China.  5. Cultivate anti-American ideology and tactics in the next generation in China, so that the next generation can continue these strategies.
He really thought he was going to get away with it.. that confused says it all
I feel for this guy. The officer had no way of knowing that man had drugs in his system. Tell me again how a knee on the neck doesn’t let you breathe. It’s total BS, Walters needs to be FIRED for inciting riots!  Attached is a demonstration video. Fuck the jury and any fucktard who thinks this is good news!!!  https://youtu.be/cLelanQ8mRc
well well well if it isn’t the consequences of his own actions
Remember when YouTube was mad that crowder had his neck/upper back kneeled on for 9 minutes plus and didn’t die? Oh wait, you probably didn’t see that
He was so bewildered, like if he didn’t see it coming.
Does anyone see his forehead getting red? His horns were coming out
I loved getting to see him slowly realize his pathetic life is over. The beginning of justice.
We can now finally all breathe. Rest in peace  George ☹
Verdict: Guilty  His eyes *(°) (•)*
The people crying......-_-  Get a life
ALL FOUR OF THOSE OFFICERS SHOULD BE ROTTING IN JAIL RIGHT NOW. Fuck them.
He was looking for someone to help him more than likely another cop but no one was there, make him wear blue prison clothes !!!!
I don’t understand why anyone would want to be a police officer
Better lucky next time pal 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So wrong criminals are criminal and don’t deserve any blessing
Imagine if he wasn't guilty. Imagine what would happen on the streets... they sacrificed him for peace.
I know the cop was wrong and guilty but let’s never make fun of anyone’s pain . Never know when you or me can be in his shoes or worst case.
Let this be a lesson for all those racists cops out there! This punishment was light. He needed to get life!!! Its still not just!!
His eyes are panicked. He was probably trying to find a way out.
#FREEDEREKCHAUVIN
How disgusting we have cold blooded murderers as cops here in the USA , throw him in the slammer where he belongs. All the other privileged brats too
Chauvin pack EXTRAVAGANT
Floyd was a career violent FELON. Officer Chauvin should be acquitted of ALL charges! What a sham of a trail convicting an innocent man.
This is very sad I don't think he intended that morning when he woke up to say I'm going to kill George Floyd this whole thing is very very sad....😔
If y’all I don’t know believe this is real ur dumb
The murderer should spend the rest of his life in jail.
Get recked noob
Teach your sons and daughters  to be good citizens and teach them respect to this society and authority and good values  and then YOU WILL HAVE THE MORAL AUTHORITY TO CLAIM JUSTICE TO SOCIETYIN FRONT OF A CAMERA  WHEN YOU DODNT HAVE IT WHILE RAISING YOUR KIDS ....and this goes for mothers of all races . ...  true like it or not
On another note, who else thought that was dust or cobwebs in the upper right on the computer screen? I literally tried to wipe it off....
Ruined a white man's life smh. Let's blame the death due to an OD on a cop doing his job. Social justice is cancer along with the democratic regime.
I'm sure cops won't learn from this but let this be a warning. Ya'll can't get  away everytime taking people's lives playing God 😝
I didn’t expect anything else.  The prosecution could’ve rested their case after playing the video and the testimony of the woman who took it.  I only watched it once and I couldn’t watch again.  Just heartbreaking to hear this man beg for his life.
Chauvin's probably rethinking his decision to become a racist murderer tonight.
LATAAAAA BITCH   Happy 4/20 y’all
It’s really sad no one is protecting this police officer ....
COMPLY AND OBEY AND YOU WILL BE OK....👍
Push ups & bible
Even Jesus would have convicted this man of murder.
The problem is the people who allowed him to remain employed after all the incidents he has had that have led to complaints filed against him.
Saint George was such a pillar of the community.lmao
His eyes rolling back, and forth, that’s the code they use to beg for white privileged🤣🤣🤣not today Derek, you gonna get a boyfriend in prison, Battyman police boy.
Dude is absolutely fucked in prison lol
Rest in power George Floyd. This is just the beginning. The justice system is next, we will keep on fighting.
The fact he hasn’t been sentenced yet bothers me, also he will probably spend time in a protected space by himself rather than walking amongst other inmates. What a scumbag
Fuck em, hope he gets what’s coming to him in prison
Derek's eyes: 👀↕️↖️↗️↖️↖️↗️↗️⏯️
The fact that strangers are overly emotional about this verdict , you know a recorded MURDER and him actually being convicted speaks volumes about this system !  RIP Floyd ❤️ I’m sorry
I hope he get life but that's to good to be truth.. But to be found guilty is blessing🙏
Being a former convict myself I know exactly what it feels like to have that verdict read and those cuffs go “clank clank”. I love that he has to go through that🥰
good
If other murders can get 25-life in prison then he can as well. Give him the max he murdered a man right in front of our eyes, an unarmed defenseless man. Derek is going to burn in hell for what he did, he will have no kind of peace in his life.
Now arrest and convict all of the people who were rioting and destroying buildings. Wait sorry I forgot that it’s legal to do that now if it’s for a sensitive cause.
Thank you this is a a relief guilty guilty guilty manslaughter he deserves to feel every single seconds of the actions and choices he made on that day.  Next police officer please ? There was more then one  No Mercy to the arresting police officers,  " I hope you find hard to breath  today "
I bet these punk ass cops will listen now when somebody say they can’t breathe ✊🏾
He seems confused. I'd love to be the one to explain it to him.
Chauvin has no response. How very psychopathic of him.
Only people upset about the verdict are the looters. You know they went out looking today to see what shows they wanted and big screens.
America needs better training for these police officers.
The guy died because he was a dope fiend. If it didn’t rule this way, the juror’s would’ve been doxed. It’s good to know that our judicial system can be influenced to heavily by emotion rather than fact. What he did was approved by the handbook of the police department. His knee was on his back. Not his neck. Facts and evidence weren’t taken into consideration here. He was on the verge of an overdose and that was his own fault. Chauvin should’ve called an ambulance, but he did not kill him. Ridiculous.
Free my nigga
The only sad thought I have on this matter is that at the end of the day george floyd is still laying in his grave and to watch Chauvin handcuffed and watch his life thrown away over his extremely poor actions during his duty which all both events could have been avoided drastically but sad as it comes it came down to this and it had to be done... He is no longer entitled to freedom and must stay behind bars until he dies
Bitch ass pig cops. Lock his ass up.
This is almost as bad the tim heidecker trial
I’m surprised I only thought the lesser manslaughter charge would stick( I think he can appeal the others.
Although I’m glad justice was served, I do feel bad for him. But not nearly as bad as I felt for Floyd.
I feel sorry for chauvin
If there was no video of the incident, he would have simply received a paid administrative leave.
I'm not a racist because some black ppl are cool and nice but alot of black ppl are difficult to deal with
YAY.  Thank God. That's all I can say.
Now he's thinking about that long ride to prison.
Wait for sentencing.
I actually feel really bad for chauvin. Floyd was being really difficult and didn't want to cooperate, they couldn't get his big ass into that cop car so it had kissed chauvin off wasnt his intention to kill he just lost it and went too far....
I watched it 10 times back to back. This is satisfying. Hope they do this to every piece of shit cop that think they can get away with anything
American Justice perverted by "The Mob" !
He looking like he surprised or confused at the verdict smh! #justicehavebeenserved THANK YOU 🙏🏽
If I were him, even if I were completely innocent, I would chose to sacrifice myself just so the riots, violence and revenge against Police men would stop. I would be glad for this verdict. I never imagined that a people can cause so much harm to their own country and people just to avenge the death of one man. Let alone a man who had pointed a gun at pregnant woman once and who is now considered a hero. This is a fact and people seem to blindfold themselves to facts lately. So many people died or suffered because of the hate and violence on the streets. If I were Floyd and could look down I would just burst into tears for the monster that my death awakened in my fellow citizens. Violence will never be healed by violence.
No one: Chauvin’s eyes: ➡️⬅️↖️↗️➡️⬅️↘️↙️➡️⬅️
Man he so scared😂😂😂👀
:) :) :) :) :) ❤️😎
Justice😎/👌
👏Well done. I respect and support our police, but I do not support police who think they are above the law. Today Ex policeman Derrick Chauvin got served. Rightfully so.
“KARMA  IS A BITCH” IN THE NAME OF “GEORGE FLOYD” 🙌🏽
Hes locked up now😂
A very sad day in America when an innocent man is convicted because he is white. The blacks are happy to take a white man down. This is so wrong and so sick.
No more free donuts for you buddy 😁
Serve your time , don't take your own life like a coward , rather have forgiveness with God but not by taking your own life , stay safe in there.  Justice was served n continue will be
THEY HAD THIER VERDICTS SET AS SOON AS THEY WALKED IN THE JURY ROOM. THEY JUST WAITED 10HRS TO NOT MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY THOUGHT IT OUT!
As a last hoorah for 420 day i ask of you to join me in smoking that   Derek chauvin pack 🚬 So long bozo You will not be missed
why do people lick their fucking nasty fingers when going through papers? i mean, i know why they do it but hands are fucking nasty. ugh!
The tables is now turning and things are changing. Things like this is not going to fly anymore and their will be consequences! All you peace officers that's suppose to serve and protect should be scared to lose your job and jail time. That should make you think about your action next time!
The Iron Sheik Tweeted: “FUCK THE DEREK CHAUVIN FOREVER!”
HAHAHA ... Chavin scared sh**less 😂🤣  #GUILTYASF   #RIPBIGFLOYD 👏🏽🙌🏽
Use your badge now to cover your but as shole...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don’t think he comprehended the first verdict he was searching around for clarification😂😂
people outside didn't cared, they were just waiting to start a riot....jajajajajajaj not this time.!!!
George Floyd was not no saint. The policeman Shouldn't have never done what he did that wasn't right. But, the policeman  should have  only been found guilty on manslaughter. George, put a gun to a young lady belly.  She was pregnant.  I hope the policeman gets it over turned.
Look who "Can't Breath" now.........
All lives matter
They judge tripping literally
I mean, it was pretty obvious this was going to happen.
The jury voted guilty cause they didn't want to see their city burn
Someone's getting a new prison wife
George Floyd every race as me Mexican every race is with u . I’m with u , you deserve to be here . You deserve justice ,this monster needs to be put away . God did justice and we the people did justice 🙏🏼
I have watched the guilty verdict read several times now, each time paying close attention to Chauvin's face. Clearly he is devastated by the charges but there is not one single ounce of remorse for his crimes. That's a damn shame. Good thing he'll get a lot of time to sit and think about it!
They got the verdict right.  The trial should have lasted an hour tops.  The defense was complete bullshit.
BODY LANGUAGE EXPERTS:  what do Chauvin’s rapidly and constantly moving eyes say as the verdicts are read? BODY LANGUAGE EXPERTS:  what do Chauvin’s rapidly and constantly moving eyes say as the verdicts are read?
https://youtu.be/-OF3YpX8kgI
Oh no he murdered a drug addict who robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint. What a monster
I don't agree with the verdict. Is so much to it
3:17 She was crying  You can see how much this impacted not only Floyd’s family but also the whole world. I can only image how the world would respond if he wasn’t guilty.  🙏 😃 #Justiceserved
Isaiah 53:5, he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed. For salvation, people just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is. We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD. We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Don't get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH.  If you believe in this message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ so people can get saved the right way. God bless you!
Mr. Floyd can finally rest now that justice has been served.
Defeated
Maxine Waters and BLM never wanted justice, they have only wanted revenge.
you could see the fear in his eyes.... he really thought he would be found not guilty. he knows hes not gonna last a year before someone offs him
It was at this moment my anger was relieved, it's about time the police are held accountable.
Good, he deserved to be found guilty and I do hope this sends a message to every single bad cop, every single corrupt DA/SA that have covered for bad cops for decades, & any corrupt Judge takes a long hard look at how the people are over the abuse of citizens at the hand's of these corrupt and criminal cop's with badges who have always had immunity from justice and covered for each other.
This feels right.
Don't drop the soap
Life should not be like this! Justice has been served, but nobody has won. It should have been such that Chauvin didn't kneel on Floyd's neck, so that Floyd wouldn't have to die, and Chauvin wouldn't have to go to jail, and families wouldn't have to grief and hurt. Too many lives have been devastated. I support the verdict, but today still remains a sad day for me. We have to start loving better and doing better as human beings, so that if one of us hurts, all of us hurt. Then no one will want to hurt another. I hope this brings real change to our country. All these events should not have taken place.
It doesn’t look like he cares about what he did 🥺
Back to Protective Custody cause if he were in population a black guy would surely kneel on his neck.
A SOME POINT IN HIS LIFE HE SNAPPED AND LOST HIS HUMANITY.  HE IS SICK!   MAYBE HE SAW TO MUCH EVIL.  BE CAREFUL WE ALL ARE HUMAN AND CAN BREAK TOOOOOOO.
Can’t believe y’all say RIP, like George deserved peace. Nothing but a lowlife drug dealing, cop assaulting, woman beating asshole. FUCK GEORGE FLOYD. BLM YALL ARE A JOKE
His quick eye movents says, I'M FUCKED!!!
At 1:42 he looks directly into the camera
The first cop in history to get convicted on the national marijuana holiday and he can’t even hit da blunt🤣🤣 Looks like he ain’t in rotation...
GUILTY
Throw away the key
Now he will be someone’s B and get a non Caucasian D in his A 😆
I saw such a puny little pathetic coward when the verdict was read . A small man with a small heart. He looked so defeated. Very different than what he looked like at the crime scene!!!  A tyrant who played god with another human beings life  I got angry watching him being cuffed because he deserves much more than being handcuffed!!!!
This verdict is dedicated to all the cops who bullied us, discriminated us and destroyed our lives as human beings.  -F..k you Jill Reiter of Palm Beach State College!  -F..k you Plantation Police Department  -F..k you Plantation Fire Department  Privatize Law Enforcement!  VICTIMS.........WE FINALLY WON!
Hohoho oh derek chauvin, prison is the last thing you need to worry about, you should be terrified of what's to come AFTER death, you took a man's life in cold blood regardless of the circumstances, breaking one of the ten commandments, one day you will have to answer to the LORD,and if you are found guilty the lake of fire awaits you derek chauvin, MAY god have mercy on your SOUL....
Should have been acquitted!! Fuck our justice system, scared of BLM and ANTIFA if they didn’t deliver the harshest sentence ever... George Floyd assaulted a pregnant woman, he was a shit human
The judge must have loved hanging the verdict over us like a game of keep away
Does anyone know if prison clothes have pockets he can put his hands into?
poor guy
I'm sure BLM will find another retarded reason to burn down a city. Lmfao.
Judge got happy as fuck when he looked at those papers baby! 😂😂😂🙌🙌🙌
Justice was raped at this moment
🙏🙏🙏👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Why does he look so surprised. 😑
Derek Chauvin has been transferred to the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Oak Park Heights, Oak Park Heights is considered to be one of the safest prisons in the United States. The prison has never had an escape, and only one homicide. Less than 500 inmates, the disneyworld of prisons. Justice my ass!!!
ANOTHER L FOR THE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
That verdict was a joke,    For all we know....  Derrek Chauvin is gonna fake his own death while in state prison, the prison guards will escort Chauvin into Federal custody while they take him to get a plastic surgery changing his face appearance,  burning his fingerprints with acid like the Russians do in order not to be identified,  and changing his name finalizing a new identity.  Chauvin will have Diplomatic Immunity so he'll never be prosecuted again while He's   getting pampered for life by the government.  He'll be free as a bird just NOT in America.
Welcome to the pen but bet he makes his appeals Nd gets out after 5-7 years hopefully not but they're just waiting for media to cool off.
Hey regardless of whether you are brown yellow or green this SOB needs to be off the streets for the rest of his life . You don’t take someone’s life and go to jail for 10 years that  doesn’t fly . He should be an example for all the tyrants that are currently working  with police that think they can get away with their crimes .also the other officers that were there and assisted the murder and did nothing should be put away .
Wow. I actually hate humanity a little less now
If looks could kill!!the idiot surely has killer eyes
Well at least over.
He looking like oh shit I done fucked up
🙄!🙄
Even if he’s put in protective custody, his fellow inmates will always find out eventually. He’s a piece of dead meat.
Not gone be good in prison for him
Well, no more decent people are going to want to be police officers....  great job :)
Why are people celebrating? I just don't get some people! You better wait for SENTENCING!
You really thought you would kill him and get away with it :/
If he's not in solitary, I'm pretty sure his cellmate is going to kill him in much the same manner that he killed Floyd. Either way, that's at least 2/3rds of a life taken away.
Thats all we wanted guys, accountability. Thank you all for nailing this one ❤️
Lookin at 30 years
Derek Chauvin had SO MANY chances to do the right thing.  Multiple people told him repeatedly that George Floyd couldn't move, couldn't breathe, didn't have a pulse . . . Derek didn't listen to any of them, so George was murdered.  Hopefully Derek will have a very bad time of it in prison!
WHAT A  DIFFICULT AND  TOUGH  POSITION THE JURORS WERE IN.  PROUD OF YOUR STRENGTH AND COURAGE IN YOUR DECISION.
When the badge can't help you:
No riots was the verdict of the woke american justice system.
Best 4/20 ever?
OJ killed Nicole and Ron..hopefully we see justice some day like we did today.
No remorse from this murderer, but in that shower though, he's gonna get his.  Over and over again
Chauvin: 👁👁 👀 👁👁 👀 👁👁 Nelson:    🤓
Imagine disliking true justice
Hopefully he stays in jail.
Them showers ready for sum candy racist booty
He not only destroyed his own life but also the lives of his family and for what Hatred towards certain community. I really wish he get a black cell mate
He and others like him always have a past history
Thank God
Is anyone taking into consideration that George Floyd over took three police officers while he was in the squad car? And that he spit fentanyl pill  onto the police  floorboard?  Could that be perhaps a reason for his great panic and  heart failure?   Enlarged diseased heart and fentanyl overdose?  Did anyone see the video of the 17 minutes prior to him  in the  ground;    Where he fought  with and overpowered three police officers  while  in the squad car? And Already saying that he can’t breathe...  why was he already complaining about not being able to breathe when he was setting up and fighting with the police in the back of the car ?
Woohoo, derek chauvin body language says, I did it, by standing up chest up hands behind his back. he will feel the pain in jail.
Bravo Minnesota.  Police cant kneel on someone's neck for 9 minutes and kill them.  Does not matter what was in his system or background.  He was a human being the cops didn't even try to aid when he was dying.  Good job jury.
About time. Good job jury.
The crowd would have become a lynch mob if he hadn't of been found guilty this was wholly Political BLM is a volatile form of black nationalism with anarchists mixed in between supreme Justice should apply to all Chauvin had been found guilty already in the court of Public opinion his side tbh had been greatly misrepresented as he had been painted as the pantomime villian throughout the trial he had no malicious intent to kill or else he would of been charged with first degree this was clearly manslaughter unintentional tragic death of a suspect we've all seen the footage and tbh floyd wasn't cooperative if he had been this mess wouldn't have hit the fan and reports have come out that he had covid anf drugs in his system https://youtu.be/vnk0CGOizXA
You cant keep killing gods chosen people and think you will get away the world has a debt to pay.
*Cancel the police. *Let the inter cities burn. *Property values drop!!! *Us investors will scoop up property CHEAP, Detroit @ 1,000-5,000 per house "its getting there." *Elect officials that want peace. *Fire the turd maxine waters & co. *Fix-n-flip homes. *Rinse and repeat like the jirmach bottle says!!!
There’s no way the jury didn’t feel threatened. I was on a murder trial as a juror and was followed home after. My car was shot.
Well, this just goes to show the American justice system can be bullied, that jury was to scared to let him go, and even more so how law enforcement turned it's back on a fellow officer, IM NOT FOOLED, watch every season of cops, a knee is on a back or a neck every episode, that judge was prejudiced against the officer, the jury was prejudiced over the officer, George floyd was a worthless criminal who wasnt even at work that day, did he even have a job???? No, I think not, and all these lunatics out here that the government refuses to protect its citizens from, like the truck driver who shouldve ran those people over when the law refused to act, yall just ain't jumped on the right truck yet, smear now, laugh later would be my slogan towards you ingrates, foul, this is foul to the core on both sides, all the people locked up in worse cases than this, never see the light of day after someone's lost there life, dont be fooled america, there is no justice, no loyalty no nothing but greed and selfishness, followers every last one of you....
My bad
Hahahahahahahaha. Good
We learn to be evil, but we can also learn to be loving and kind ❤, I pray for everyone 🙏
Look at Chauvins eyes..lol
George floyd died from a drug over dose. God knows. Guess most the commenters havent had the  "DARE" PROGRAM in their school. But yall dont give a fuck yall just wanna see a white man arrested which makes you racist and prejudice
No bail!
I would have paid so much to see his face without a face mask. He’s always been so smug and would have loved to watch that drop right off.
Terrible verdict, honestly.
How pathetic that they lock him up but let the Boeing 737 max ceo and those that was involved in 300+ death walk away with a fine but this man doing his job went to jail. Sick of this BS white n black division by the media.
u shall be made an example of derek.
They are gonna “welcome” him in prison... I would be pooping my pants right now
Bet my life all 12 members of the jury are the members of antifa
We need to start this racist s*** all over again To all caucasians Let's vote Trump 2024 So many more black lives can be destroyed  You guys seem to get off on this kind of stuff Tonight you're probably party like a New Year's Eve celebration
He’s tryna stay strong but, he gon cry in the car😂😂
Only found guilty to keep rioting from happening. Our justice system is corrupt as democrats.
Chauvin put his hands behind his back when he first stood up, he must have known that the guilty verdict was coming.
Lol his chest int look so big no mo
I hope he stays safe and shows repentance. (yeah, I DO)
Let this verdict be a warning to all of the remaining PO's, CO's ....that people are starting to speak up and out; and the days of you  being allowed to act un-civil, un-professional are officially over with this verdict!
Justice has been served! 🙌🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻✊🏻✊🏻
4-20 🌳 🌳 🌳 just makes this 10x better
To be hated by an entire nation must be a terrible burden. It would be for me. I pray that  Derek comes to Christ with a repentant heart one day. Jesus can offer  forgiveness even if nobody else is this world ever will.
AmeN 🙏 they also tax frauds hahaha BUSTED
All 3 counts how do u feel now Derrick
Best 420 EVER!
Hey cop watch out for that bus
One quick way to fix the broken system fast:  require officers to carry their own liability policies as realtors, insurance agents, and such have to do.  Tax payers will no longer be footing the bill.  Even a small claim would raise theirs rates, weeding the bad ones out and keeping them from being hired elsewhere.
So sad that we fought that black lives matter but now they are the one causing asian hates 😭
That’s how everyone will feel when they stand before God and the verdict is read. GUILTY. We have all fallen short and if you don’t have Jesus in the court room on your defense on that day you will be in a worse place than Chauvin.
Good. I like seeing him in handcuffs after his disgusting and selfish act. He smothered a guy to death in front of a sidewalk full of children. He is a terrible, sick human. I am glad he will have a lot of time to think over and over about his actions. I hope he lives a long life in prison.
Sad day for us all. People stop pointing the fucking finger. All these protesters bitch for love and acceptance for all . It's never going to be enough for you people. Where's your compassion now?
Your new friends are your new inmates, be nice to them or.........................................
America’s downfall almost came down to a low life drug addict and a policeman who didn’t do his job correctly... the next 100 years are gonna be crazy af
Rot in hell
🙏 at long last
One racist Cop down 999,999 left, keep your cameras on! Let's catch these Dirty Racist Cops red handed, and make sure they get what they deserve for all the unreasonable hate, and unjustified pride they have Amen
Fentanyl killed George
Supreme Justice Matters
Come on everybody sing with me! ~The racists have lost!~Chauvin is Guilty!~Justice has finally prevailed and now we're cheering!~Woohoohooooo!~
Bye bye 🤡 have fun in jail for 75+ years you bozo.
There’s nothing here to glorify will bring George Floyd back . Regardless
It's kind of hard to tell with a mask on, but odds are there were no emotions on Mr. Chauvin.  It's almost as if he knew he had no chance to be acquitted.
Is it bad that I lowkey feel bad? He completely deserved it but his eyes when he realized was jus kinda sad
Modern day witch hunt
Trump Germany Hitler Gorge Floyd.. pattern
He said 👀 real quick
I would hate to be chauvin right now. To go from a house with food carpet and couches to concrete and bars and shitty fiod. I know hes crying when hes alone for hours. I did time.. Its a hard thing to cope with
All you had to do was get off him when people were telling you he looked like he was not breathing and not conscious. Any rational person would have checked to see what was up after being limp and motionless for so long. Disgusting. Justice has been served.
75 years eaten noodles cookies chips sorry not sorry Justice has been served now don't forget don't drop the soap while u n there .no visit no wife no bullying no living good no freedom  oh wow man how sad that is
Only because they know people getting tired of the bs
POGGERS CHAT HE'S GOING TO JAIL
It’s the last 3 minutes when Floyd appeared to be dead and he kept his knee on his neck.
How can he be guilty of 3rd degree murder? It's a completely different thing.
That demon convinced him to throw his entire life away
Well that incredulous look of his didnt work.
He act like he didn't give a f*** when he was found guilty he thought he's going to get away with it but he didn't
It’s just a verdict he can potentially get less sentencing in 8 weeks
This is not over, clean out the Police departments across America..Because their are a lot more Dereck Chauvin's in law inforcement just like him. Always have been!!!
Now time to try and jail all the other cop murders!!!
Yes!!! Now get your ass outta here. 1 down about 160,000 more to go. Then  maybe only the “good ones”  are left....
It’s bout to be a lot of triggered Mayo men
I love it when things go like they should!! Justice is served! Orange suits him better.
But behind the trial hes free stupid idiots
Black people are like "This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, this little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, LET IT SHINE!!!". like if you agree. Justice!!!
Well take care of your Nalgas..
Police should not respond to every call. If it's a black, the white police should pass it to the black police. If lawmakers do not respect their laws there is no law. When lawmakers encourage rioting, they are stepping  on their own law.
His face was priceless
Excellant verdict.  Now what about the officers who stood by while their brother killed a man?
Gf overdosed, mob rule is disgusting. No justice no piece right?
As soon as I heard the word guilty I collapsed and broke down in tears of joy justice is served.
Couldn't have been a happier 420 Salute✌️💨😤
Some of yall so racist you can't believe the jurors actually wanted to convict him
Anyone who thinks this cop didn’t kill George Floyd should have someone put their knee and full body weight on their neck for 10 minutes and see how long you last
Chavin is gonna be tossing a whole lotta salads on his knees in prison 🤣😂
They deliberately held the verdict until 420 so we can focus on this trial instead of weed. Shame shame.
He overdosed on fentanyl obviously. Sudden three verdict charge only one having decent merit. Jurors probably too scared now. Maybe the appeal would get the higher charges out just in time for when another riot is needed? Also does this at least mean everyone will stop rioting, looting, and burning aka being domestic terrorists now? Maybe that anti-riot bill can be applied in many, many more states and it'll at least keep the states with brains with much safer streets.
What goes around comes around buddy. The right door for justice system just opened. RIP Mr. Floyd.
This is horrible! Why would anyone want to be a police officer? Why do we glorify criminals like George Floyd? Crazy world!
Yessss!!!!!
Seeing somebody getting this sentence and feeling good ! 😌
So... how many years will he spend in prison now?
Public defenders, I'm a court reporter this guilty verdict is for all your court cases you've defended where the cops were are crooks and it's obvious they did crooked shut but got away with it.
Bout time some justice
The saddest part though, is the huge amount of hate in these comments. It really shows who the truly hateful ones are.  I've lost all hope for human kind. Fu all.
👮🏻‍♂️: 👁️👄👁️
Buh-bye, dickhead.
This is no victory. Just another scum bag put away. The savage ways of mankind will continue. Nothing can stop the nature of the beast.
As to the Bad Cops out there take Notes from this
If it was a black man on a white guy, all the Trump racist, kkk parties and followers would have been outside singing kumbaya... stop making excuses just like for any white cop killing a person of color - who's next is the officer that racially abused his power and against the black army lieutenant... that officers needs his head 💥off by someone and his address and family posted - they all need suffer for his actions just like that black man did
Free my boy Derek. George died of asphyxiation
He deserves the stiffest sentence 40 years to life..I bet Chauvin  want put his knee on anyone's neck in the BIG HOUSE!!!😡😡😡
I'm a little shocked it only took a day lol, but also relieved 😌
I honestly don't know how to feel about this...one part of me  thinks it's about time one of these white cops got locked up, but the other part of me feels something real sinister on the horizon...I guess we'll see though.
I can’t celebrate the end of anyone’s life, including Derek’s. This is just sad all around.
Looking at 150months with additional time apparently.
GUILTY!, GUILTY!,GUILTY! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
They had him looking like Colm O’Driscoll off Rdr2 after he realized he wasn’t going to be saved from being executed😭😭‼️
What a miscarriage of justice. Think about it.  Its just politics, not justice. Thousands and Thousands of hateful people would've burned cities if Chauvin wasnt found guilty on all charges. Is that justice?  How can these 12 jury members be fair and unbiased with the massive media hysteria and lies?  60 years ago, they would move a trial to another state if the case was to known or the risk of a biased jury was possible.   Today, thats impossible. That makes justice impossible. This was never going to be a fair trial. This is truly frightening. But hey - with leftists, communists and feminists ruling the world, this is what happens. Threathen, quiet throw in jail or kill people who don't agree with you.  Im not saying Chauvin should walk free. But no way in hell He deserves 40 years in prison.  The video of the arrest that the media released is manipulation at its finest. When you see the whole video, you see the truth.  Floyd was high as a kite on fentanyl.  Chauvin is guilty of gross negliance, not murder.  God help us all.
Chauvin's Eyes   🕛🕧🕐🕜🕑🕝🕒🕞🕓🕟🕔🕠🕕🕡🕖🕢🕗🕣🕘🕤🕙🕥🕚🕦    Lmfao
And on 420? We getting high
Fact the prisoners is waiting for him to come so they can find someway to kill him it just a matter of time
1 down👋🏾✊🏿 3 more amigos 2 go
Thank you my dear HEAVENLY FATHER ABBA GOD 🙏!!! In the mighty name of JESUS CHRIST OUR SAVIOR!!!
Justice has been served today!!! Historical moment for all people of color!!! Charge the others who knelt in solidarity with Chauvin, with accessory!!! The real criminal left that courtroom in handcuffs!!!
Its not even the same dude lmfao the cop in the vid and this dude look nothing alike wtf xD
The other 3 cops should get the SAME  not just him.
If he go's to regular population they're gonna make love to him... 😅😅😅
Is he going to be in jail with the rest of the population?
1:38...When your life flashes before your eyes..
Hey Mr. Chauvin, Ain't No Fences At Camp 8 , They Don't Need No Fences , They Got Them The GUN LINE Boss ! Lmao 😆
Should have been a miss trial.
You don't look so bad aas now slime bag I hope prison is good to you lol
Derek is Alive, with no family or friends to mourn him. George is dead, and has a whole country remembering him. Both men’s lives are over, but history knows which one will live on for years to come.
Finally
They gonna choke u verry much in jail Mr police 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Shit looked staged
it would've been ironic if the cop threw chauvin to the ground and put his leg on his back because he was "resisting"
He snapped back to reality after that bond was revoked🤣 GUILTY PIECE OF  SHIT💯
Bail is denied and bond is revoked and the defendant is remanded to the custody of the Hennepin County Sheriff...... I have never heard such sweeter words...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣..... actually if he was found to be not guilty it would have been an Armageddon in Minnesota..... and in the entire United States as well
Why cant humans just be better. I would rather him be free and George be alive and none of this ever happened. I feel like im living in an alt plane if existance.
Bro His eyes looked like el chapo being extradited to the US He Knows his life is over
Sometimes the jury get it wrong, thanks God this time they got it right!
you can edit that title and call it what it is, he was sentenced for the murder of george floyd.
Its safe to say DONT KNEEL ON PEOPLES NECK FOR 9+ MINUTES IN THE NAME OF THE LAW. It will give you prison time.
Justice was served
The Rouge cop is Guilty as charged. He wanted to make an example of another Black man to the bystanders like his people did to my fore-parents.  He thought he can get away with it like so many before him did. Cameras don't lie even though his defense did. Thanks to these Jurors who saw the truth and put justice in it's place. Now this bad cop knows what handcuffs feels like. Put him in the all Majority jail population and then see real Justice happen to him. Next justice for the Daunte Wright case.
Let the 🎉 being for his death in prison it just a matter of when who cares how
He will never last to live his sentence. They will kill him in prison.
he realises now that this is all real. no one there to protect him anymore. sentencing is still a few weeks away but he is going to be in jail for a long time and that is maybe an understatement
Jesus some of these comments....
His eyes couldn't believe 😂😂😂😂
Quick ass verdict
Glad the circus trial is over. And now he will be somebody's 😂 birch...
Not justice just appeasement of the Mob.
Scapegoat.....
Thank God for that! Why 8weeks for sentencing! BAIL REVOKED!!! He will obviously have his own cell etc. They will probably put razors in his dinner!
Hows that jumpsuit fit fuckhead! Hope you never see the light of day again. Also have fun in isolation where your sanity will slowly slip away. Fuck you 🖕🏽🖕🏽
Justice justice
I bet Trump is saying dam it I wish I was president so I can pardon him
It's not nice celebrating a man's sentencing If he pays by doing the time, no man is exempt from a second chance if he sincerely reflects on his actions.    May The Lord guide him and US all to be better to one another.
Too bad it's covid time I would have love to see the complete face reaction
Chauvin was like “Oh no why isn’t my white privilege card activated? “
He has serve his father satan the devil. He should get his compensation
for some reason he does not look the same as the other cop in the video that killed floyd
Evil bastard! If only he treated Floyd as a human being?! What a waste of two lives and so much trauma for the families involved and those who witnessed that horrific scene! Being a police officer is an honourable job, they need to start acting like it!! They’re making the good cops look bad out there!😒
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Rest EASY George!  Happy 420!!!!!
Jury was pressured and intimidated.
I just wanted to see his reaction That Dumb smirk isn’t there any more who’s their bubba big daddy bubba
Crazy how it takes almost a year to decide whether or not he’s guilty smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Good job for the jurors!!
Rest in piss Chauvin
Glad there was justice for George Floyd. I just wish there were justice for the thousands of others as well. Hopefully this will be an example for all the officers out there with hate  in their hearts. One tiny step for American but we’ll take the win.
Bubba goin pop cherry
All I can do is cry yall....this have been so emotional for the country 😢
Some looks as their whole life  went down the drain
#GeorgefloydChallenge
I know this is justice a long time waiting. But along with the Floyd family I ask that we find it  in our hearts to pray for Chauvin as well. I know some may not feel like he does not deserve forgiveness and he dictated his own fate.  By no means am I condoning his actions, but at the end of the day we are all human and still deserve compassion.
324 small hearted dupes disliked this...
Justice for Chauvin
Guilty!!!!!
Yessss
He's innocent
Imagine taking a thug off the street and going to jail for it
Yesss!!! Justice was served!
Got Chauvin in my blunt. Smoking his ashes
Kim Potter..they're coming for u next!
It looks and feels so good seeing him being taken away in to custody now look at the fear in his evil eye's he looked like he was terrified. R.I.P George Floyd
This is a huge wake-up call. No one is above the law. You will be held accountable!!!!!
He gonna be trying to wear metal made shorts every time he drops the soap Lol
Lol to every bootlicker who was citing bs autopsys saying he died of natiral causes and/or drugs and that thid guy wouldnt get charged
He deserves this, though the first appeal with win on a mistrial. He will be put on trial against and likely lose that one though. Despite everyone commenting stuff about how he looked he, I think he stayed calm and looked pretty professional during it. Hopefully he stays locked up for life!
Now put the other cops on trial for negligence or aiding and abetting a murder. The cop keeping the crowd at bay wasn’t the least bit interested in what people were worried about, even though Floyd was unresponsive. R.I.P. George. At least the low life looting thieves have no chance to smash shop windows to steal tonight!
Made an example of to keep the peace with all of the animals burning our cities down.
Rigged piece of crap jury and system
And I don’t feel bad!
Thanks god Biden is your President now to be able to get this verdict✌ hopefully next the woman policewomen killer /GUILTY too. Next...😆
What about the cops that stood there and did nothing!?
The look on his face is priceless and happy 420 to all 🚬
In the immortal words of Jim Nabors.....”Surprise, surprise, surprise”....
They had to find him guilty or they might have killed the judge. Real talk. It would have been chaos in this bitch. They would have burned the whole world down. And we all know that's the truth. It was more fear than justice I think
Maybe George Floyd's daughter will grow up and pass out counterfeit money just like her dad did.
We lost a cop today
Don’t be surprised when he gets 3 years and he’s out in 18 months.he’s a cop for god’s sake!!!! 🙄
All of this couldn't been avoided. I bet if he could go back to that moment it would be so different now.
So some bum and crackhead  got justice. U can’t lose confidence in the justice system
Haaaaahaha he thought they was about to give his ass a pass. Haaaa bitch haaaa!!!
He’s not gonna last a week in jail
Alle louia 👍✊ jail him now 😠 guilty guilty guilty 👏👏👏👏
He doesnt look too worried. This may have been arranged to stop any riots. Will he be eligible for parole?
Why he so shocked 🤨
was this a fair trial when main stream media and other news network are siding with a guilty verdict.. i will not be a surprise if their a retrialed.
This is the bare minimum! Glad he is going to prison for the charges. Those eyes say everything! Like “come save me 🤣”
Will he be in GP???
They needed a guilty verdict otherwise there would be mass looting again.
I support ALM but this is good  whos smoking the Derek pack 🚬🥶
Justice was served pigs .big mad r lil mad
Vengeance is the Lord's. God is still in control. We are living in perilous times. Prayers for our Nation and this sin-sick world. Prayers for every living being God's creation.
Freedom for Derek Chauvin
I feel so bad for him
Found "Guilty" due to the fear of riots occurring all over the country!
He certainly did not need to be found guilty of all 3 counts. The jurors were probably scared of what would happen if they didn't find him guilty on all 3 counts.
Look at his eyes 👀 now
Luke 2:14 "Glory to GOD in the HIGHEST and on earth peace to those on whom His favor rests." Hebrews 4:13 No creature is concealed(hidden) from Him(LIVING GOD), but EVERYTHING is naked and EXPOSED to the eyes of Him(LIVING GOD) to whom we MUST render(give) an account. GOD have mercy.
Yes vindication we don't need to stop now we have to move forward we have to move forward all lives matter
I’ve been to prison before so I know for a FACT he sitting in County Processing right now Shitting his pants and sick to his stomach. And rightfully so. You took a Life so now you have to spend the Rest of your life In Prison filled with regret and anxiety. He deserves 100% of those Guilty Verdicts.
Praise God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Don't tell me there isn't a GOD
His eyes did the Kratos fucking combo
I will never watch this channel again. And by the way Floyd is still burning in Hell where He belongs
Ha Ha Ha take it in you should be scared big lil boy your not so ruff now are you Chauvin. Throw away the 🔑
Derek go fuck your self.
Please don't drop the soap n don't turn around keep ur head straight n don't get fuck n the ass
He's going to try and commit suicide that's what they b!^%/ a$$ do when the pressure is on.
YOU SUCK JUDGE
Si fúl seu canalha!
Dumb asses R still gonna riot
The only reason he was found guilty is because of the mob outside if you don't vote our way we will burn your city down, mob ruler Justice is no justice, this will be their tactic here on out, Kevin Parks Vincennes Indiana USA kevinparks30286@gmail.com
HAAHAHAHAH BYE XOXOXOX
He better get used to spreadin them cheeks
Well Now I wonder what he’s thinking ,Killer policeman!!!
Derek is innocent.
So sad poor officer 🤢 just doing his job 😔 George floyd was a piece of shit 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤡🤬🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮free derrick
Thank god
Hallelujah! Justice is finally served
He isn't doing life he will be free in 5 years
Not so smug now is he. Hope asshole enjoys the rest of his days in prison!! Too bad there’s no chain gang for him!
Now we have to get the other three cops that assisted Derek with killing George Floyd cause I’m not satisfied yet
You suck judge
i think it was an accident.    and thats what he should have been found guilty off.    it wasnt murder.     it was inv man sl.
I feel sorry for Chauvin
You can thank Maxine Waters threats for violence for that quick verdict decision.
So what becomes of the other cops??
Politics politics and always politics
Chauvin was railroaded by the govt and the jury because they were intimidated by fear of reprisals by the mob, pure and simple.
GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY 👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿
Yes💃God is good🙏🙏🙏justice was serve!!!look at his eyes though..lol
You better hope when you go to court your not treated the way he was
Go in hell BLM
Finally justice is served. And our house doesn’t burn to the ground.
Happy now??
Does he give anyone else a Timothy mcveigh vibe? Also he's so calm and barely reacts.
JUSTICE IS SERVED!!!!! 🥳🥳🥳
I'm so happy he was found guilty on all charges! Thank you jury!
There was definitely reasonable doubt.
What a way to have his ego checked after all these years being able to walk around with what he thought was the freedom to do as he pleases Boy was he wrong! Finally people of colour have reason to feel heard and valued- History in the making 🖤
I wonder what his facial expressions was behind that mask. Didn't see him pick up a pen and take notes this time.  May God be with him
Fuck the police
They claim to be calling for justice. What they’re really doing is intimidating the jurors — warning them what to expect if they get the verdict wrong. That’s the way justice works in America. Yeah, a fair trial....right 🤔
So much for all those folks saying he died of an overdose 🤣 that man murdered him
He's like wtf!
Free my nigga
So glad that POS guilty!
Jurors b like  Don’t burn my home
Jurors don’t want they home to burn
His defense team should have gone the insanity route because this man is not there mentally.
His facial expression was priceless!!!  "IMA WHITE MAN..WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?"
Let him rot in jail.
The other 3 will be making plea agreements for aiding & abetting. Bad cops everywhere take notice.
She said Derek Chauvin was emotionless. But his eyes said it all. He was shook, stunned and all. I cant even feel bad for him. But lets see what his sentencing ends up looking like.
So let me see if I've got this right... The prosecution's own experts say that, had the case hit there desk on the day, they would have ruled either heart failure or overdose, the original toxicology report comissioned by the state said one of the main causes of death was overdose, according to his girlfriend Floyd overdosed (almost fatally) a month or so before on the same drugs that were in his system in large amounts during the arrest that lead to his death, the man's drug dealer was supposedly in the car with Floyd before his arrest although that can't be confirmed or denied because he refuses to testify, there is video footage of Floyd resisting arrest to such a degree that he needed to be restrained and according to experts asked to give there opinion for the trial, the method Chauvin used was entirely proportionate and is regularly used to restrain people in potentially volatile areas... Like when you're a white police officer restraining a belligerent black suspect *that has previously used a gun to threaten a pregnant woman* while you are being watched by a mob Yet the officer is guilty of MURDER? Manslaughter I'd get, but full blown murder? Don't get me wrong the guy should get time for something, maybe boost it to the upper limits of manslaughter, but murder is just ridiculous given everything else that contributed here
F*** this guy. He deserves everything he has coming. He committed murder 100 percent!
Smoking on that Derek chauvin pack🚬🥶😈
It's a great day in America when a cop is found guilty of their actions #justiceforgeorgefloyd #blacklivesmatter
Justice was served
All these people in the comments getting mad over this verdict😭💀, keep coping losers. Justice is sweet.
GUILTY! NO BAIL.  Justice Served.
African Americans are not the only ones that is fed up and tired ... ALL AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF SEEING INNOCENT BLOOD SPILL EVERY MONTH DAY YEAR WITHOUT ANY CAUSE
FREE DEREK CHAUVIN!!!
He will win on appeal.
Why did he get O.J.s sentence. Hope you all are happy destroying a good police officer for a punk ass thug. C'mon white people...time to riot!
Dead man walking
Damn threw his whole life away all for hate  lost your wife your kids everything all for hate sad smh ahh well 😂😂
He will appeal it and win. Jury poisoning  from Biden and Maxine.
He's gonna win on appeal. Reason why civil lawsuit was introduced into the trial. And I don't think he's safe in prison. Who knows someone might hurt him or kill him
PAY ATTENTION OFFICERS  !!!
Political theater.
If he didn't have the person that supported him then I'm sure the trial wouldn't extended.
I must say I am shock that they found him Guilty.
This was..that was..socialogically fascinating. And quite frankly just simply fascinating.
Welcome to a hypocrite nation/generation. Just wait until the real virus shows up.
Sad world we live in.
I’m just glad George “Fentanyl” Floyd is off the streets.
No one has a right to get away with commiting murder not even a cop
I think they found him guilty as they are scared shitless of what would've happened if not guilty verdicts comes  back, I think it would of kicked off big time rioting looting the lot rightly so.. WOW I wasn't expecting that guilty verdict. Now every police force  who have theys  bullying killing so called police officers think twice about pulling guns or heavy handed on petty things especially on black folks
So basically a criminal becomes a hero and a hero goes to jail. Wow. I guess we should all be criminals. Every police officer should go on strike. who would want to be a police officer that cannot do his job and can go to jail for doing there job.
The United States is a society that is collapsing. The whole farce with George Floyd illustrates this perfectly. America is becoming a failed third world country.
I’m sure Chauvin will soon find someone kneeling on his neck while bubbas coming up from the rear. Justice at its finest. 🤣🤣🤣
There's no way he couldn't get guilty, I just hope he doesn't take the easy road by taking his life, he has to pay for what he has done
These killer cop's have to much power like these judge's
This was a hate crime!!! And he should have gotten charged as such.
Floyd was a criminal and eventually died from his criminal activity. Didn’t matter if a cop did it or not. You live by the sword, you die by it. Floyd was no Martin Luther King Jr. or Malcom X. He was used counterfeit money to steal shit.
Make it legal that people can interfere when they see a murder happening
Phew
Blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy.
He used to drop people off at that jail, now his ass is getting dropped off
Disarm these killers
WHITE LIVES MATTER
Take there guns
No more qualified amunity ever
FINALLY!!!!
Those eyeballs rolling.
Noodle time Derrick
American "justice" system caves in to mob pressure again just like the OJ trial. Smh
https://youtu.be/D1scajWS2Yw
This was not a fair verdict. Floyd didn’t deserve to die but he was on many drugs and resisting arrest. Chauvin did not intentionally kill him. Too harsh of a punishment. Threatening violence if they didn’t get what they wanted. Unfair.
Sending an innocent man to jail, is not a step forward.
This is a great job and great day. Thank you attorney Ben Crump.
I cried when I saw this for me he murder the man am not racist am a black man but when I see people go to jail it just makes me sad NO MAN SHOULD BE IN JAIL!!
Political trial
Free Derek Chauvin
I mean are we really doing this I mean losing pretty much his life for killing somebody do we really receive joy out of that that’s not not only did he killed George Floyd and the families to live with that but this man his family is also going to live with him being god yeah he did something terrible but do we really high five I mean everybody loses here nobody gains anything nobody you don’t get George Floyd back yeah this guy goes to prison but what does that accomplish we accomplish nothing just shows that people are becoming more animalistic than anything
Fuck you BLM
Legend has it , his eyes still moving. 👀👀👀
It is so sad to watch them find out that their life is over. However, this is an important case and hopefully, the officers will think at least ten times before causing fatal injuries going forward!
Anybody the know the minimum time that he can be sentenced to? Hopefully it goes beyond a minimum  slap.
Hello people 10 years from now coming back to watch the trial about the event that changed history
Pupils dilated what the hell is he doing with his eyes? Guilty guilty.
They are gonna tear his ASS up in jail!!
justice is served
Appeals are fun...
Like I said found guilty or watch your country burn
I guarantee over 90% of the people here being all happy about him being found guilty never even watched a single minute of the body cam footage.

Have fun trying to sleep there chauvin. 😂😂😂😂
What people are forgetting in this whole situation is that George Floyd was a dangerous person. He was very tall, very strong, has been in trouble with the law numerous times and had drugs in his system. Cops just want to be safe and get home to their families at night. If you resist arrest you deserve to be restrained...In this case unfortunately the restraint went to far and I feel the other police officers around should have stopped this cop from continuing to kneel on his neck blocking his airway. I can see both sides
No somethings not right, you can’t be that calm knowing you just been convicted for killing an unarmed black man, no way ! I believe there’s something dodgy behind this case to get him a low sentence.   A nigga from the ghetto would have got life if that was backwards but who says backwards and forwards work alike if yo know what I mean
Yipeeeeee
This is a mockery of justice.
Yipeeeeee
My people out here after seen the pain of all of this and the previous.i.hope u guys wake up stop hurting each other..we have to do better and pull together. Amen
Guess I’ll build something with all these useless bricks,, Maybe take a trip with this extra gasoline I’ve been stockpiling 🤣🤣
Floyd overdosed, he killed him self.
All his nightmares will come to reality.
Well,, looks like Mob Rule in USA now,,, ALL DOWN HILL from here
I'm 100% sure if the family was given the option to bring back Floyd to life but they have to give back the millions they got, they'd choose to keep the money over bringing him back. Know he can't come back but if it were possibly they'd choose the money. There's no way the cop could get a fair trial in this. The government would rather lock him up than face the riot and destruction that would take place from the BLM activists if he were found not guilty.
He not worried at all, why coz he knows he jyst need to disappear maybe Europe or Mexico?
YESSSS !!!!
Dam why stopped NOW. Keep burning the dam cities up.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dam morons!!. Eventually you won't have nothing. There is nothing in my neighborhood, because it's all Burn up.!!!!!!!
The amount of Russian trolls in this comments section is abysmal.
1:34 *His eyes were stiff for the last second before detonation* That's how you know he was faking the stoic expression
This shit is not bringing him back. That's not enough
🙋🏽‍♀️Kim Potter: You’re next🙃#JusticeForDaunteWright #JusticeForGeorgeFlyod #BLM #ItsAnewDay #WeAreNotOurAncestors
Oh my, na they ditn't.  😱  God is in the court.👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏🙏  All praise to the Great Jehovah.
Trump team what’s happening this is you son who’s guilty
He is guilty and should go to jail, no question about it. Standing on that man neck was cruel. But i cant help fell a bit uncomfortable while watching all those people celebrating. The all affair is a sad situation, where there is nothing to celebrate. Again, he should pay for what he did, but these few minutes gave me a bad feeling where the USA is going as a country and as a society/culture. Hey, then again, maybe it´s just me...
Bye bye Mr. Chauvin   Your stupidity and Ego  Won you a Government Funded Vacation for a long time 👍
The official fall of the American justice system.  You people were so scared that they would find out who you were, you were so scared that these fucks would start burning down our cities again.  Cowards.
*Judges hands were trembling as he opened the Manila envelope wherein was the verdict*
75 years in prison total,  40 yrs, 25 yrs, and 10 yrs. Guilty on all account's. God is sovereign.
Hope the appeal over turns this nonsense
YESSS! Make an example out of him and let this continue for any other “officer” that kills anyone
Our Black Community is going to be BLESSED ten fold they do not have to be waiting this long to get justice for all the loved ones they lost due to police brutality and carelessness. Rest Peacefully Mr.Floyd justice was served for you and your family!
This was for all the mammas across the World. We all felt that deep in our souls and hugged our babies when we heard his last cries as he was dying was for his mamma 😔
Yes..the issue is how many years..
Looks like black guys can do whatever they want now.
Hope his cell has poor ventilation so it's hard to breathe
Biden , Harris and Pelosi should go to prison also.
he`ll never. sleep in his bed again never. drive a car.
MAKE AN EXAMPLE ‼️‼️‼️
ez
Well at least he'll pay for the mess he made.
There are not winners here, George is death, the George's family are devastated, this guy was a police now in jail, and the Derek's family now are destroyed too like Floyd's family
They messy zooming in on him 🤣🤣🤣🤣
A "reasonable police officer" is gonna spend a few decades in prison.
GOOD!! Justice Served. I think He really thought he'd get off..he'll only be getting off....now, in prison.🤔😉
I don't understand how he was charged with "unintentional manslaughter". When he kneeled on his neck for over 9mins what did he expect to happen?
189 black on black Murders in st louis 2020   No BLM Antifa News Media Protests  Next story
Hahaaa holy shit his face has me dead LMAO
For some reason I felt really bad for Chauvin ! I don’t know why . Maybe I need to go look at the footage again !
The person who really needs to be behind bars is Floyd's drug dealer
We are lucky Where I live I don't see any police.
Lets just not interact anymore.
Why was he so calm tho! They gonna let him go soon
RIP George Floyd 🙏 You can breathe easy now. Justice is Served!
Let me guess,  innocent people. You all were innocent when you went to prison.
HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING HOME.  FACT CHECK,  NEW ADDRESS AND ZIP CODE.
Nasty Nate is going to get Derek's fruit cocktail 😂🤣😂
He's a cop...he will have alot of new friends in prison❤❤😉
HE WAS LOOKING RATHER CRAZY,  THAT'S BECAUSE HE IS
It doesn’t matter. Waters will get him off with her propaganda. .  The judge even said so.  The only reason he was found guilty is because the jurors  have no back bone. You notice how Derek didn’t have any emotions. Cause he knows this is just a political movie . This has just been a political movie the past year. .   Nothing’s real , nothings been real this whole time They know how george died , you watch he will get off on appeals due to the negligence by waters. .
Wait till I get my hands on him
This is america..
Mob justice wins and liberty dies... If I were a cop I'd steer clear of responding to calls involving the black community... to risky you'll get this GARBAGE...
Police should carry their own insurance to pay for court costs and lawsuits.
FINALLY JUSTICE 🙏
Where's his wife at? Did he have any one children or close family that loved him we could watch cry? I want to see his grief for the grief he caused..
Thank God
Who decides his sentences? The jury or the judge?
This is crazy cops are gonna be afraid to arrest people now because some drug addict might die while fighting arrest
Spineless jury allowing the mob to intimidate them!
It's very sad. Counterfeiter, intoxicated operating motor vehicle and reciting arrest is getting justice .. it's B.S.
He’ll likely go to a country club prison where he’s protected. Too bad if that happens. He needs to be inside with Bros who would kick his non remorseful black hearted Azz!
A man is dead because of this dude's power trip.  He got what he deserved.  It's gonna be rough for him in jail...everybody knows what he did!
Well would ya look at that! Consequences :)
This is a very happy and sad day both and a new beginning to justice. May George's family forever stay strong and i thank the lord for uniting the creators children to bring change. We are all human beings and bleed the same blood. Justice is finally served and this proves that no one is above the law even those who work in the law. God bless you all. People around the world were watching..
B S
praise the good lord for instilling compassion and empathy into the hearts of the jury. this needs to be put to rest, i can breathe so much better now, they found him guilty in all charges and although i would like to feel sorry for him but i cant, it was fragile ego they done him in, his depraved mind wouldn't let up, it was his authority and entitlement as if he was God, i don't think so when u come to destroy and kill as the devil when your job was to protect and to serve.
😳😟😒🙁😧🤨🙄 lmao his eyes
A police officer doesn’t fair well in prison 😬🤨
im so happy
“Convicted”. A word that has to lead to ACTUAL change. Way too early to celebrate folks, we demand EQUALITY in JUSTICE for ALL. Rest in peace George Floyd.
DEREK CHAUVIN EYE'S DON'T LOOK THE SAME LIKE THE DAY WHEN HE KNEELED ON GEORGE FLOYD NECK, RIP MR. GEORGE FLOYD
How many years?
They were both at fault. The cop with a god complex. And the thug was a heartache waiting for a place to happen. So in my opinion, no lose in either way.
I am having mixed feelings, happy that he was found guilty on all 3 counts but saddened because George Floyd had to lose his life for us to get to this point of finally getting justice! 😢💔🙏❤
Well this is dumb. He definitely wasn’t guilty.
Fox like always disabled the comment section. Hey officer murderer wasn't talking notes
You may rest easy now Mr. George Floyd
NOOOOO FREE MY MAN
from Australia we are very happy with the results of this trial. GOD IS GOOD. There is HOPE AMERICA 🇺🇸 don’t give up!!! 🙏🏾
Love seeing dirty cops go to prison. He will live many years in a personal cell with a little TV..  enough time for him to think on his mistakes
Damn this whole court scene was like out of a anime
He looks confused  Yeah bro You guilty AF
I bet all racist cops are crawling back to their caves now
OFFICER COFFIN is GUILTY 💢
Yall are putting down officers like their murders what about the people that not wearing a uniform they did something wrong to get pull over maybe he was reaching for something yall said fuck the cops but when something happen or need help who  yall call 911 maybe listen to police then running and other shit. And not all cops are bad so stop the hatred against cops maybe think before u say or do
I'm thinking, by the look on his face, he wasn't expecting this AT ALL!!!
George Floyd is a kind man, role model, a hero for all black people. His legacy will live next to Rosa park and MLK. It is unfortunately he died of racist acts.
GOD WILL HAVE THE FINAL SAY ALSO WITH  MR.  CHAUVIN
It isn't worth being a pig
I don't care kirsch.
F
One day we will all be equal... UNITED STATES OF AMERICA😍😍😍😍😍😍🖤💯🥂
Im glad he got justice and i wish we could’ve rode for Trayvon Martin like this 😩
The shock on his face is a pleasure to watch......
Now go think about the wrong you did.and may God forgive you cause after prison you will go to hell
Looking at him makes me sick
Yesssssssss!!!!!
😂That's not even the same "Derek Chauvin" the other guy must have been relocated while this trial took place.
George floyd was such a lovely person, robbing People and stuff. People are really closing their eyes on who they celebrate. Even if death was not adequate, George Floyd was a terrible person judging by his actions
Another klu klux klansman off the police force ....  Good start.... There will be a welcoming committee waiting on fish row ...
HE got what was due to him.#BLM for ever
I didn’t know he could be charged with all 3 geez 🙄
PACK WATCH
America has put up with this sick police brutally for way to long.  It stops today.
This should be a lesson to all cops like him
So how long will he be in jail?
Appeal
The verdict is unsafe hope he wins his appeal
Thank God that jury did the right thing. If they didn't america would be burning now
everyone better be smokin that Derek pack today.  4/20
Free Chauvin he did nothing wrong
George was a criminal. None of this would have happened if he obeyed the law.
He doing the math in his head!!! 10+ 5 +......ect...
he gonna get killed in prison
Thank you to our allies, you help this happen.
What's written on the palm of his left hand? Anybody know?
That was the look of a man who couldn’t believe he was being convicted..
Don't drop the soap
Chauvin looking like he already lost 10 pounds the party is just getting started for u buddy
For every person this prick fawked with during his career......  JUSTICE........RIP MR. FLOYD
This nigga didnt know where to look 👀😭😭😭
Just read the comments and you will see yourself in them.
All the looting and burning for nothing but greed. Why to burn and loot for now?
I was betting on a manslaughter charge. This was unexpected.
Sending that white man into a prison system as a former cop is cruel and unusual punishment.
Chauvin's reaction is priceless!!! LMFAO!!!!!!!
Though I am glad justice is being served, I hope they have a separate prison for officers in violation because even when someone is in prison, they don't deserve their life to be in danger. I know people don't want to hear me caring about the officer, but I care about everyone and this is what cops are afraid of. Most are trying to do good and, though deserved, he should have a place to finish out his sentencing. And not house arrest, like an actual place for cops.
He'll be out soon enough
This man never came there with the intent of killing this drug head.
Burn in hell,George Floyd.
He will be weeping all night to himself. Hopefully after sentencing he gets put on gen pop
"Better That 10 Guilty Men Go Free Than To Convict A Single Innocent Man" -Blackstone  American values are gone from the popular culture.  Standards are gone.  We The People know what we're supposed to think, but we have forgotten why.
*WAAAA MUH WHYTE PRVLEDGEEEE WE WUZ RUUULERZZZZ*
He was like but I am white bro he got convicted by a white man ahhhhh😂😂😂😂
I just hope this will be a lesson to all law enforcement agency..
Remanded and charged .. We are adjourned
Of course you realize, all the Police in America just gave up and quit
The only reason he was found guilty is because these terrorists would burn down Minnesota.
Yesss finally 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
That will wipe that smirk off his face 👍
Thau shall not k!ll.
People celebrating the desgrace of the others....Only in america!
Theres nothing to celebrate about this. Possibly a 75 or more years in prison
Now he can kneel in his prison cell as much as he likes 😂🤣😂🤣😂
He never stood a chance
Wow I can't say this was justice. He was only really guilty of manslaughter 2. I am just shocked they found him guilty on all charges.
🛑 BLM ARE RACISTS 🛑
HOORAY! Thank god Jury plead him guilty. THIS CALLED FOR A CELEBRATION! 🙏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾
Rest in peace, George. Your death was not in vain. You came into the world to ba a sacrifice, a martyr for your people. Thank you and rest well, we will take it from here.
Derek couldn't breathe the whole time the judge was reading the verdict....
All the Minneapolis meth heads jumping for joy right now. They got another one off the streets. 🤣
How many  years can this murderer going to get????
How many years did he get?
Dr. King said Looting and Rioting are the Voices of the Unheard. They Heard them Today Guilty on All Charges
...aaand there will still be rioting.
Hope they beat his shit on prison
Why does he keep looking off to the side
George Floyd would have survived if he complied and didn’t do drugs
We knew this was going to happen..... politics.
Looking at the people that are thumbs down on this shows you a little barometer of the bigotry in this country.. I got news for you bigots that think it was okay that Mr Floyd was murdered.. you are as guilty as that cop that killed him.. Jesus is watching the game.. Derek's hell starts now.. Republicans will see their hell after this life.. God bless you George
A great day for justice. Thank goodness for the fantastic prosecutiion team, the great witness testimonies, the jury who saw the truth and the star witness which was the video. There's a long way to go, but there's real hope....
The 24th is coming up You know that means 👉👌
Something is wrong with Derek
Lol @ all the angry wypipo in the comments
Systems still corrupt and races as f*** I mean this man clearly kill George Floyd on camera clear clear they have to drag this this far before justice has finally prevail
Good.  About time these bullies in a uniform are made accountable.  So tired of these crooked ass cops over stepping their authority. The only thing I wish would happen is please come together peacefully so we can work together to put a stop to this.   A good day.
Anyone that knows the legal system have a guess what will happen when he appeals? Will his sentence be reduced? Law is not my field of study
EVERYONE FILM THE POLICE.  SOMEONE PULLED OVER? FILM THE COP... SOMEONE BEING QUESTIONED? FILM IT... FILM EVERYTHING
His eyes was having a stroke🤣
So how long they say he is going to be locked up for
Yes thank you thank you Jusus amen just to see their is hope in the system and also america knew what would happen if he were not convicted... yeah buddy bout time...
Court Officer to Chauvin: “Stand up and put your hands behind your back.” ❤️🙏🏾😗💨💨💨
Wow, 🤩 just like song 🎵   "WAR RHYTHYM OF THE MICROPHONE"
Nobody gets a pass for bad behavior not young black men not police officers all Character Matters whether you have it or not
I do believe Derek Chauvin will find out what its like to have a man kneel on your neck for 9:29
How is this murder?? It's manslaughter. Murder, makes no sense.
I hope Big T from cell block 5 makes Chauvin his new girlfriend 👙👠👜🧑‍🤝‍🧑
The "Oh shit!" face 1:34
whose idea was it to put it up to the jury?😂😂😂
You can tell he's panicking.  He has to live with this, in prison, for the rest of his life.
Let's see what Fox has to say...😏
Thank goodness
🤣
Seeing his ass handcuffed and led away to jail, guilty on all three counts, is the earliest Christmas present I've ever received!
GEORGE FLOYD AVENGED!!!
BLACK LIVES STILL MATTER WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP GETTING JUSTICE
Very sad that our judicial system was taken over by the left.
"but I'm a Montana State Trooper"
THANK GOD!  VICTORY FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY!
POLICE = BLUE ISIS
The Judge looked disappointed with the verdict....it took a man to be murdered in front of the world for an officer to be held accountable....Chauvin never showed one ounce of remorse....smdh
Chauvinism, time 4 u 2 fuck off
Let this be a lesson to all these police officers who take advantage of BLACK PEOPLE. STOP D RACIST ACT.
This was the biggest travesty of justice I’ve ever seen.  I’m delighted to see Derek’s team ready to appeal; and these charges will be overturned.  This trial had countless objectionable moments . . . and the judge helped leave 20 lb. breadcrumbs for appeal.   Floyd was a criminal; and his drug addictions killed him that day.  The truth will out as it always does.    Listen to FACTS, not to the mainstream media.   Hang in there, Derek.  Many of us back the blue.
I'm just trying to understand why are people mad at this decision?😭😊
Oh this guy is bugging out.. them eyes.
Just think that this guy will miss out on BTS 2021 return tour
ONE A POLICE TWIST A CIVILIAN 👀
I have no sympathy for the man. But the eyes makes you wonder what is going through his head as it’s been read
For the sake of the country to be saved, this verdict was inevitable.. sadly to say, the left has to much power.
TRUE JUSTICE - "EYE FOR AN EYE" Put this (BAD COP) in Genearl population for 9:29 min's - cuffed.
Once sentenced, this dude’s probably going to the place where he has a lot of “old friends” eagerly waiting for him. He won’t be able to leave his cell without needing a guard or two (or ten) next to him.
Thank you, jury.  Justice for George. RIP.
FLOYD WAS DEAD FROM FENTENAL 4 X OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Praise God
Bubba Floyd has a new Celly. #RobinHoodloom on IG & YouTube
What felony was he committing during the arrest?
Take his ass away
Handcuffed and taken to jail whoo hoo!!
Cheapest suit I have ever seen a whiteman wrapped in...May this verdict be a lesson to All corrupted cops 👀
This cop nothing more than a thug has met lady justice. May he spend every day thinking about Mr. Floyd. Amen.
GUILTY BITCH
I think it’s only right we get a George Floyd strain now. What a way to celebrate 420. 🙏🏽
Lmao. Bruh. I haven’t been this satisfied for a while l.
Al sharpton is talking on 1070 a.m. Los Angeles and he's saying we got on our knees that's funny because I never saw him on his knees!.
Sentencing next week.v
NEEDSS to reflect the crime 40+ with NO paroll.Refreshing news R.I.P BIG FLOYD SUC for LIFE!!london.
No fucking way
Hopefully when Chauvin serves his sentence he doesn't become a drug addiction and a forger
Bout time we see justice in this country is the best day of our lives God bless America
He seems to be very satisfied that he has done his job for white supremacist KKK like he already know he's going to receive a very light sentence for someone who's gone forever
Sad day indeed
I hope is cellmate is someone like Christopher Scarver.
Such a quick unanimous verdict, especially on the higher counts that the Prosecution did not prove beyond reasonable doubt, would seem to indicate a jury tainted by fear of what an acquittal on any charge would mean for their city and their loved ones.  California Rep Maxine Watters made it perfectly clear that the terrorism would become even more confrontational if she didn't like the verdict. And Judge Cahill commently publicly to Nelson that Watters actions had just handed him a successful appeal.    While I do not like what Chauvin did and believe there needs to be judicial response to it, the 2nd and 3rd Degree Murder charges were saddled with serious doubt when the Prosecution's own witness said that given the situation (a code 1 response for assistance, a giant of a man successfully resisting 3 trained officers) Chauvin would have been justified in Tasering Floyd . . . but opted for the less aggressive response of a physical restraint.  (Given Floyd's twin heart conditions and drug toxicology, the Taser would have arguably also killed him) How can you be intending to do maximal harm to someone while simultaneously down-grading the level of active restraint you are justified in using on them?   This was a verdict to please the crowd, the media, and Maxine Watters.    It is practically guaranteed a successful appeal.  Which I'm not cheering about.  It would have been far better to do it right the first time.  Chauvin was seriously over-charged.   Especially when contrasted against what former officer Kim Porter was charged with -- and she outright shot Wright!  (Which one can argue she was justified in doing given his outstanding warrant, the innocent 3rd party in the car, and his flight from an officer).   She was only charged with 2nd Degree Manslaughter.
I wonder if he has a diaper on because I know he just doo dooed on himself...👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Rip George Floyd God rest ur soul
I believe he was responsible for the 3rd charge..not 2,3 degree murder...now looters and rioters, you can rebuild all the minority small businesses y’all destroyed as well as making up for the billions in damages. Fair is fair...
#PepStepAnthem
*VERDICT* : GUILTY  *DEREK'S EYES* : 🕞🕓🕒🕝🕜🕜🕠🕕🕡🕖🕗🕠🕔🕟🕧🕜🕜
🤜🏿🤛🏿🤝
Don't celebrate yet because this guy still has not been sentenced if the judge gives him a slap on the wrist cities will riot all over this country
Sad how died. Should of never of happened. Let’s be clear but we are talking about a drug addict, a person who robbed a women and put a knife to her Throat, and spent years in jail and people are making him out to be mother Theresa. What a joke!!
Listening to NWA now 🎶🎵
He may be guilty but who knows he may get a cake sentencing. The system works in mysterious ways
Will be smoking a fat blunt for George and his family today
Derek You Sir -You are my hero,man who lost fighting for justice.
Dont know why he went to trial should of pled guilty and gotten it over with?
Prison will not be kind to Derek, he better learn fast. He's pretty much dead man walking, being an ex-cop
With Life and Liberty and Justice  for Floyd !
Let's hope he doesn't do an Epstein on us I want big bubba to sing sweet nothings in his ear while he is rear ending him
This is why I love 4/20!!!
Chauvin about to see what it feels like to have somebody on HIS neck
i never talk about stuff like this but i had a feeling that either way charged guilty or not, there would be riots
Fuck this shit fentanyl Floyd overdosed way to give in to BLM cause you’re afraid of them burning down the city
They took no time. I'm glad.
Good to know they still do witch hunts in america. Guess we really do have a broken justice system.
So how can u get charged with 3 diffrent murder charge for one person?  Dont get it?  I believe in 1 rst degree murder which he should get life without parole and be someones girlfriend.
Free hair weaves first hundred looters
One gone three to go
All the boot lickers mad their boy going away. Good i say
Shortly after Derek's appeal was heard and ALL charges were dismissed he moved to a western area of the country and began his new job as a deputy sheriff.
It wouldn't go this way if there weren't all those protests
That cop pack hittin
Let’s fucking go nigga
Thank God
Lmao I bet the great people will still protest and loot lmao
I see him now and have pity but let it be a lesson.. spread hate receive hate. Spread love get love!
I hope that this is a lesson for officers that are aggressive and abusive
He was innocent of murder in all reality he didn’t intend to kill george
Thank god! Its a 420 miracle
oh no! Officer Chauvin forgot to take notes, how will he remember he's a convicted murderer without notes?
If IKYFL was a person
Justice was serve🙌🙌
Guilty on all counts!!  Justice and accountability!
Thank you ancestors! Happy 420. Get the rest of em!!
You should be grateful that people only want justice and not revenge .. You son of a bitch!
Oh noooo now come the happy, peaceful riots and looting!
Who holds a straight face no emotion if they feel they are innocent that's the message that should be sent to so many who feel he did nothing wrong
Dude turned into Data
I thought the system was systemically racist.
I don't give a fuck about george floyd and his family, they were all dead I would not give a shit.
5;07;min...cold blood.,,,,Justice has been done.
He looks shocked af! Goodbye!
So there should be no rioting across America.
This is sad to watch 😞
Dont drop the SOAP bruh!!..I betcha he playing that scenario over and over in his mind...and hes thinking it was not worth it.
Can you imagine if he was found not guilty this country would have had a zillion dollars in damage and not one  Animule arrested
All of y'all going to sleep good tonight 😂😂
What a sad day for the american justice. Lets be honest, the jury was scared of being targeted and doxxed by blm/anti fa. Blm and antifa are terrorists.
He ia were he shod be. .
Railroaded
Damn there will be so many inmates not even scared to make the first move on him not only cause he killed someone but also cause he’s a cop. But he will prob be in PC just harder to get to
You can rest in peace George Floyd. Breathe baby breathe!🌷 thank you Jesus got him he is a demon. Thank you Father🌷
I just don't understand the murder charges. Am I to believe it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt this man killed George on purpose?
I hope he gets the max
Look at Chavin's scary eyes. He looks like he's about put his knee on the judge's neck! 😨
Welcome to America land of true democracy
Buh-bye, Derek... 👎🏿
He isnt guilty, but your country is corrupt to the core Thats why they remove comments on most videos "do not dissent citizen" . You people are so fuked.
Sad day for the american justice system....
Welp... time to light our torches and do what they have been doing when they deal with what they think is bs
Thank God....for once a murder hiding as a cop is brought to justice
Someone is gonna make a meme out of his eyes
This was not the actual truth. The jury was scared for their life. All of their information and location is given to the public in Minneapolis. They wouldve been chased down if anything else happened. Such a corrupt system in America
I’m going to watch this again but with a glass of wine just so I truly enjoy the moment he realizes that even he, a cop, isn’t above the law.
justice. thank you, jesus.
🔥Lets see who still justify his actions.. Ill wait 💤
an early bedtime tonight for all the robbers and looters...😂😂😂😂
If anyone lights a match I hope they are taken care of if they try to burn this city down.
Justice was served .
Happy 4/20! We celebrating for the soul of our brother George Floyd you deserved and recieved justice !❤️
Half these people commenting about the riots was super quiet during the storming of the Capitol. Hypocritical asses. Please shut the fuck up. We really don't give a fuck about your Jim Crow state of mind. Smh
This man pride is unbelievable even found guilty, the man is a psychopath and no remorse whatsoever.
The jury had to of been watching the news about this.
Quite a different look on his face from the video of him kneeling on sweet Mr Floyd's neck
Chauvin barely seems fazed...daaamn
He shouldn't have been convicted
Mistrial
We all knew this is going to happen I was there anything that could happen everyone from politics to movie stars were saying this is what had to happen where were his police officers defending him a fear for the police and poor white people
Trump must be besides himself now, haaa
lemme hold in my laugh 🙈✨
Revoked ASSHOLE  BYE BYE DEREK GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR ROOMMATE PEACHES..YOU GONNA BE HIS GIRLFRIEND
BLM protestor: Guilty?? Yay!! But also booo!!! Now we can loot tonight? I saw these beautiful Air Jordan Nikes that would’ve really looked nice with my new gold chain I loote.... I mean bought after putting in extra hours at my...... job. Where is the justice in this guilty verdict?? Huh??
That's right chauvin, everyone's hands in front, yours in the back lmao
Guilty he is but more destructive than anything else is infusing everything with "race" what the fukk does it matter what race either Chauvin and Floyd are this shiit happnes all the time to white people  as well its the bad cops that ruin it for everyone  this country has a fukking racism fetish assuming a crime was perpetrated against someone solely do to race without evidence other the the incident is total bullshit! I am hispanic been pulled over  more than a few  bad encounters I am to blame I was mouthy and young since then have encounter nothing but genuinely  great officers an officer once spent 40 min helping me get my car which was hopelessly stuck in snow I had expired plates which he saw but said nothing ...  treat officers like people and they will do the same ..
Can't wait to see what the sentencing is...that's what will say volumes about our justice system
I am soooo happy this guy is convicted!!!!  Maybe now these power hungry cops will now see they are not ABOVE THE LAW... RIP George Floyd!!!!!
Damn, he didn't look so smug & tough getting found guilty like he did when he was dead staring while he pushed his knee harder into George Floyd's neck!! Happy 420! Celebration time..except for Chauvin🤣!
Chauvin is so narcissistic, he thought he would be found innocent.  What a sicko!!!!
Why does he look so fucking surprised?
I hate this country
He is look, and he is brain, going through , what my god, what I have done,,,but you are now being say I CANT LEAVE IN JAIL.BUT ITS TOO LATE.
George Floyd RIP Born: October 14, 1973, Fayetteville, NC Died: May 25, 2020, Minneapolis, MN Vindicated April 4, 2021, Minneapolis, MN Amen!
LETS GOOOOO
Time to pop some meth use counterfeit bills and resist arrest there is no law and order anymore
We all know he was definatley not guilty on all charges, the truth, but they had to do this to stop a civil war that would have broke out. Its sad what our country has become
We got what we wanted but Mr Floyd's family abd friends will never get him back and will mourn way after this is over
JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!! I no the ppl he locked up are happy my my look how the tables turn
Is guilty is going to jail I'll get your life together stop looting stop rioting stop pointing fingers stop blaming and get your shit together get your life together and move on
Thank God Almighty there were no Trump people on the jury
This is putting all other officers on notice.... This will no longer be swept under the rug.. You will be charged for your misconduct..
The fear in his eyes is so satisfying to watch
He almost had no reaction
I’m so pleased Beautiful verdict can I get an Amen🙏🏻 😊😊😊
Dang.🙁
His souls slowly leaving out his body
No justification for anything other than manslaughter.  Our courts are under mob rule now. I bet the “poc” will still find a reason to burn loot and murder tonight. We’ll see.....
He is gonna appeal for mistrial and most likely  be declared innocent  at a later date
Thank God for justice!!!
Verdict:  Police Bad, Jail/Eliminate them Resisting/Fleeing/Eluding Criminals Good, encourage and reward them  (and their families who didn't give a Rat's A$$ about them/him when they/he were alive)
Allah is the most just, even if someone escapes the justice system, they won't escape when standing in front of Allah
Hope he repents and give his life to Jesus Christ. It's always tougher on a Cop to go thru this. I pray for all the families involved for the peace of God that surpasses all understanding to prevail
We at Least.the city did not get tow up yet!!!!☺️🤗☺️🤠😎🤠👍🏾
We should all blast DABABY'S Rockstar song in the streets! Yay!! Justice was served!❤️😁
It's time law enforcement were held accountable!!!
The eyes say it all. Justice has been served
This is the first time during his (Chauvin) trial that I have seen fear all over his face. Even though he had the facemask you could see his eyebrows and eyes moving from side to side in total anxiety.  This is when the predator becomes the prey.  Let all good cops flush out the bad and foul smelling cops in the system.  Cops must reform itself. Let the good stay and the thugs are sent away.
So since he was found guilty what is the sentence going to be like. Justice for George floyd
Mwahahhahahahahhaha he shit himself
I am surprised Chauvin wasn’t taking notes, when the verdict was read.
In a weird way I  feel sorry for him
Not a day for celebration... a day to continue to put a foot on the neck of suspected white supremacists. So that all races can finally see peace in each other.
The prosecutors did an excellent job and the medical experts that testified brought the truth of what happened, into the court. When even law enforcement officers come into the court room and testify that this is not police training, you are in trouble. The videos showed in detail that a crime was being committed and when you have someone on scene that is calling 911 on the police themselves, that is a red flag that something is not right. Chauvin brought this on himself because he thought he was above the law and a jury of his pierce held him accountable.
He has a big ego the bigger they are the harder they fall and he fell hard  his ego didn't save him hahahaha now his resume will  also read convicted killer those jurors made the right decisions and the judge was right to revoke his bail now he can rot in prison where he belongs
Whatch this, now, Rioters will gather tonight looting and burning in celebration of this verdict...
some justice in america today, thankyou God
Why even have this trial, the media already made the jury’s head a long time ago.
that man just sat there with no emotion on his face like a psychopath. george floyd and others who's lives were cut short may those  people be remembered
Killer
But a doctor said his death was not homicide. The jury was bullied thats all that happened

Bye bye Derek
No emotions, seems like he knows something, ppl would bust out in tears. Bet he was let go and put in witness protection something dont add up truthfully
Foot Locker's and Dollar General's are safe for another night.
That's outrageous, a good police officer in jail to satisfy a bunch oh lazy blm criminals
Wish I was as high as Floyd was that day
A good day, that's a good and fair judgment! The man should never be allowed to leave the prison again.. Best regards from Germany.
Ok, now the city will be safe from riots.  Good deal.
This is so sad that we have to come to this point, where law has to intervene to do the right thing. This would not bring a human life, and i can only wish, we should not come to this point, again and again. Humanity takes one step forward and few backwards. And I am sorry for the human life lost, unnecessarily.
He dressed up like someone sure he would be dining at the finest restaurant.
Why does he look like he's waiting for Superman to come and save him, no one is gonna help you dude :/
The fear in his eyes is so satisfying to watch.
Let This Snowball .. All Rogue Cops Should Pay
A lesson to be learned here. For all union suckers out there, remember this. The only thing the union guarantees is representation, nothing else.!!
guilty or riot chaos looting Ok guilty
There will be a war it was a fixed verdict and they're biased you cannot convict someone of murder when the cause of death was literally drug overdose
B.s.
Justice served.
What a shame this whole thing was. Floyd himself created the perfect storm for his own death - lethal drug use along with heart condition and I heard also that autopsy showed he was also positive for Covid. But Chauvin didn't do the right thing either. Just bad circumstances all the way around. Some say the root cause of this is policing and it needs reform. Maybe. But the root cause of this is rampant debauchery - drug addicitions criminal acts and behavoirs. If Floyd wasn't the way he was there never would have been a police encounter to begin with. If policing wasn't so prone to using force Chauvin wouldn't be in the situation he's in. Both parties in this case are guilty for what happened. But, I don't think Chauvin should have been found guilty on all three counts. He alone wasn't who killed Floyd. Floyd himself had a large part in his own death.   Is this going to stop the riots now? I wouldn't bet on it. Now they know riots, threat of riots work. Everytime there's some run in with LE they don't like there will be riots.  For the good, law abiding citizen, fear of a run in with LE is a good deterence from committing crimes. But for a growing number of people this fear is no longer a deterence. The results of this case only exacerbates that.
He really thought he was going to get away with it... disgusting
This is a seminal moment to learn from this historical moment to work with the present to shape the future. This goes out to the UK - not be in denial and open your eyes to institutional racism - revoke the Sewell report!!!
i love seeing true criminals punished, the look on his face brings me joy
By now, he's already in Hawaii on permanent vacation under witness protection.  No more riots, the media is happy with their lies, and the democrats keep enjoying their mob power.  End of story.
Oh you confused now its over you thought you were going to be aquitted and go home we got justice for George and his family off to jail you go
justice was served. he is now a convicted murderer, in cuffs, going to be behind bars and making new friends in a world he will get very familiar with over the next 4-5 decades
Please put him in population around all the brothers yes indeed😎
all u had to do derek is taking your fing knee off of his neck or better yet not even have had it there!!
Thank you  Jesus
Get Ready to watch America burn. You gave thugs and terrorists what they wanted WRONGFULLY. I hope you are all still happy when your house is on fire and police can do nothing  SINCERELY f#* off blm!!!!
LOL I told you.
Dude's life is over.

Minnesota will not burn
The judge made the right call. i know a lot of white people won’t agree because they prefer blue over black but thank god that judge wasn’t an idiot!
Guilty!!!!!
God is good!! This is a lesson to all those other cops who feel emboldened to kill innocent black, brown people. God sits high and looks low.
Finally a small measure of justice in the USA - a settler colonial state founded upon genocide slavery and racism that grew into an imperialist monster - is now rotten ripe for social revolution. In the past 20 years in China there have been about 20 incidents where police action has resulted in fatalities in the USA in the same period the figure is closer to 20,000. In 2020 in China about 5,000 people died of Covid19 in the USA in the same year over 500,000 people died of Covid19. The USA does not protect Human Rights - it Kills Humans on an industrial scale
So drugs killed him but cops didn’t  he basically  killed him self with the drugs his knee was on has shoulder blades  he hits women he robbed ppl then ppl rob kill riot in all name of some one who was a convict  cop didn’t kill him it was the drugs only reason why is because ppl would of went crazy even tho the drugs killed him not the cop and he was allrdy going die from the drugs he took beat up a pregnant women but he’s a hero cops did not should not done that but they never killed him
Now, Minnesota District Court can start with the 3 accomplice Police Officers, the two police officers who handcuffed, held the legs of George Floyd and put him on a prone position. Mr Thao who doesn’t take any notice of the condition of Mr Floyd and ignore the bystanders on the street begging to check his pulse.
Fentanyl floyd
Prepare for another riot everyone. Blm just gore more fuel and they're gonna use it to touch another city.
This is a beautiful day in America. For once, justice was served.
Welp, i've lost faith in society lol
May the creator helps all of us,  forgives us, and guides us on the path of righteousness. Amen.  Every single innocent life lost is very sad.
This fool sitting there looking like What did I do? 😂 😂 😂
Finally, a dead man can rest in peace
Bye bye Derek lol
It is like The Spirit of Walter Mondale possessed the jury.
Stop racialism and socialism in America. God bless.
To all those who gave a thumbs down , change is happening weather you like it or not , get with the program or get the fuck out . All lives matter then black lives are lives too .
Lol
Have fun with the Aryan Brotherhood Derek! Oh wait..... You're an ex cop. You won't have any friends. Love how that smug look was wiped off his face.
I hope this sends a message to any and all police, that if you abuse your entrusted power, you will go down.
Wow! This whole trial I've been saying Manslaughter was guaranteed but Murder wasn't happening.  Boy was I wrong!
Not so stoic now. I wonder how he feels right now being the most hated man in the world he’s up there with Hitler. There are many great brave police officers I think it’s a win for them too. Make this world a better place ~ God Bless
This is huge in the American history. I don't know ow how what he did was not on purpose seriously. He committed a murder and all he wanted was to get away with it...all he did was think about himself.
How many years did he get??
Yes indeed.
See ya boi !!!
You know this is getting ridiculous when thousands of people cry in joy cus he was found guilty 🤦🏾‍♂️ BLM
How long is he getting?
What a bulls#*t call
thanks to Derek that George Floyd will no longer hold a gun to a pregnant woman's belly
Also, the other 3 officers are shitting bricks right now. 😆
his lawyer looks more scared then him!
Welcome to the court of public opinion where facts don't matter and everyone has a gun to their back.
1 down, 10’s of thousands of bad cops next.
why yall dislike the video though?
Does that mean the riots are called off?
Ok that’s good but it’s allot more officer’s that need this
No one should ever do what he did again , especially police
Shaking in his boots
What a load of shit. Fentanyl Floyd killed himself taking drugs, not taking his heart meds, being a criminal piece of crap.  Cop did NOT intend to murder anyone.  This is bullshit.  Appeal and over turn this bullshit verdict.  NOT a fair trial.  They were going to vote guilty before trial even started.  Too many assumed this was murder even last summer.  MOrons in Jury are brainless and didn't listen to a fucking thing the evidence showed .
Sad story for all of them, it should never have happened
What a shame 2 families broken down! Derek floyd family! LORD PLEASE TAKE OVER!
Lol he will be released when his appeal goes through and find the jury was instructed wrong and jury should’ve been sequestered and all the comments made by Maxine waters and the Biden administration. He won’t do more than a year.
Hallelujah !!
I would be very surprised if it wasn't guilty....👍👍👏👏👏👏
At least no riots for a few days...whew! Judge reading verdict...(Chauvin thinking...I CAN'T BREATH!!!)
And in 8 weeks he gets sentenced to probation. I hope I am wrong.
HOW MUCH TIME THO !!
👉🏾😁👈🏾Let's goooo we smokin' that chauvin pack
Because when you're guilty you have no recourse
Derek Chauvin: "But, but I'm a police officer. Member of a strong police union. We're untouchables."
He better watch his back in pen...
This ain't just for us black people this for white people brown people yellow people whatever we consider ourselves as American citizens. The police is going to  have to change the way they treat us American citizens. We paid there  bills we tired of getting treated like shit and they walk out free not no more. Justice is serve. Now keep it coming.
The look on his face during the guilty verdict was the same look he had during the murder . He thought he was going to get away with it . Just an evil man
America your next...
Shout out to the judge!  He was fair all the way around the board he played by the rules no foul balls! Thank you and God bless you sir! JUSTICE ⚖
Eat that racists in America... just the beginning 😀😀😀😀😀
Now he's gonna have to get used to being addressed as "inmate" instead of "officer."
His reaction was “hmmmmm okay “
A man just had his life fucked over because a drug fiend OD'ed. And people are rejoicing.
I hope this case of Derek Chauvin serves as a lesson now.
Policeman better through the Towel and let the System burn.
Lmfao on 4/20?
Justice has been served have fun in your new home for the rest of your life Derek !
After sooooooo many years of African American being in this country finally justice.
He was GUILTY now let him rot
How much time he get??
Thank you jury 😍!
Game over. YOU'RE GUILTY! No More Excuses or Talk. What my Ancestors said. Amen. All praises go to The Most High. Thank you Son/ Brother for that journey. Aaaaamen!
I keep rewinding lmao at his look as guilty is read hilarious
I would not celebrate until he gets sentenced. It might be 1 year then what happy for nothing.
"While commiting a felony" what was the felonious act before the holding down GF. Hmmm
We smoking that Chauvin pack! 4/20
You doing time son 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
When you cold-blooded.. showing no emotion isn’t hard.
I wonder what all the blacks who were planning on getting some new shoes and a new TV if he was let off are gonna do now? 😂
Chauvin  was definitely GUILTY I don't think ANYONE  questioned this point.  There will be significant ramifications to this case I can assure you.  I do think there needs to  be better review processes to ensure    Police are being humanitarian BUT and it's a massive BUT...  I wouldn't want to be a police officer in these large cities for ANY AMOUNT of money.  FENTANYL is STREAMING INTO THIS COUNTRY in the Southern border and if you think FENTANYL and METH didn't contribute to FLOYD'S death AND MANY, MANY OTHER Americans of all races and economic backgrounds you are naive and badly mistaken.  I had a brother nearly die of FENTANYL overdose and pain patients can no longer get pain medication for chronic pain  and Sadly many Americans are turning to this CHINESE made FENTANYL  that is being distributed by Mexican Cartels.  This FENTANYL IS DANGEROUS AS fuck...  1 out of 10 of these MEXIS is an OVERDOSE.  THEY ARE ALSO MAKING  EVEN MORE DANGEROUS  VERSIONS OF THIS DRUG.   STAY AWAY IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE...
Thank you Jury. Justice served right to Mr George Floyd
Good day for police, citizens and the law.  We need each other. We need good police. We all arent perfect, and need to get treated better by police since its their job...its a good day for all. Lets be better. Increase the peace and good karma.
They are waiting on the inside to kneel on your neck won't be easy.
Bullshit
I hope the judge sentences him justly
Hahahahahahahhahahahahahah
What yu sow yu shall reap
I hope he lost his breath when the judge read his future.
burn the city down
George Floyd is laughing from hell right now. Probably doing lines of fentanyl with Satan himself.
He was looking shookethhh at the verdict at that very moment he knew fucd up😂
His eyes was moving so fast as if he is innocent to the crime he committed
It was a witch hunt from the beginning to appease the thugs and domestic terrorist
Ya think, the other 3 just shit themselves???
Life. No parol. Thank you lord
Cant believe this sick man made that """"innocent"""" black man take that fentanyl to give him a heart attack some people man
Thank God. R.IP George Floyd God bless your family.
THANK YOU JESUS
Feels good
even if he gets the full sentence for 75 yrs or longer from all 3 charges - he aint making it 75 hrs .. karma served. :)
All three counts at least 50 years
I do not trust the judge
Chauvin looks like, when someone going to say spike? BOOM!!!!!
He looking stupid af like he aint did shit wrong he going to prison i cant wait
He look alot like Jeremy Dewitt 🤨
Derek you need a prison knee. Hope u get it.
Wow, legit gonna put a man in jail for doing a normal detainment on someone who *killed himself through an overdose.* This is show, just like Nuremberg, they had a conclusion from the beginning, they don’t care about the actual evidence.
You paid the price!!!!!!! Let justice begin.. 1 down...... so many more to go!!!
So, it's not all worth it anymore?
We all have learned so much from this tragic event. May George Floyd rest in peace. May Derek Chauvin learned the lesson he needed for his soul and spirit in this lifetime. Bless You all ❤️
The justice system has failed. Jury was influenced. Just like the federal elections, the court did absolutely nothing. I say it again, the jury was influenced. All this is going to do is further divide the country. Mark my words. Sad day for America. No justice today, just miss Justice. The system is corrupt.
What all yall racist mf's that thought he would walk got to say now 🤔 i'll wait
It's a sad day for any white person and police officer.
Thats what derek gets for thinking just because he has a badge dont make it ok stupid ass cops i cant stand them it doesn't make sense he got what he deserves punk
I don’t see the usual comments 👀🧐 They must not have nothing to say today 😂
Sleep well tonight Derek.
There should be bail either
Time to burn city down anyway
Let this be a lessen for you other bad cops, we are watching and your next.  We the people are done with police brutality. No more immunity for cops
This is so sad for everyone. George is gone, Chauvins life is ruined and families are destroyed 😢
1 man down 2 million more to go
This doesn’t mean shit. There are thousands more of him and they will get away with it. He would have too if it wasn’t for the publicity.
His eyes spoke louder than his words lol😂😂😂😂😂
Enjoy BIG Bubba! I hope the jail supplies Him with plenty of Vaseline you P.O.S! Now your gonna feel the raft of Jail life!?!?!?!
his other two Crew members she get punished also.
george floyd died simple cause he was a black man police are not train to stand on people neck until they cant breeth this act was pure murder let this man rot in hell hopefully he can be left for dead by inmate in prision rot in hell
U wanna see real racism? Move to Hawaii, where blacks n whites are hated EQUALLY
Please don't drop the soap brosky!
I can listen to this verdict over and over again. Justice at last 🙏
So george got away with everything he did:  1- using fake money (a crime),  2- buying/selling drugs (crime),  3- using drugs (crime),  4- resisting arrest (crime),  5- faking illness to avoid going to jail i.e. obstructing justice (crime) !!!
May he burn in hell
I Pray every day your in prison you will hear George Floyd VOICE.. And Remember 9:29... Nine minutes and 29 seconds For thats The TIME it took for you to TAKE His LIFE...George Floyd will never get To Hold HIS daughter or walk her DOWN THE Aisle ...so be in your misery that you caused...maybe You will Find Jesus and ask for Forgiveness...💔
I am happy he was found guilty but looking at the comments and people are laughing, it's abit much.
Thank you Lord!!
In shortcut-quilty of stupiedity,having no brain, murdering with cold blood in shiny day. All together-300 years hard works!!
Poor guy. Everybody talking about his eyes, but the reality is he is a broken man. Lost everything, job, freedom, his right to speak, probably his family by now. And all because some guy overdosed.
What we witnessed was Chauvin going through a cognitive dissonance...the way his eyes were moving suggested disbelief...it ain't over yet...the sentencing will be a point of interest
GUILTY on All three counts as it should be!!! Today was a magnificent day! R.I.P GEORGE PERRY FLOYD, R.I.P BLACK BROTHA ✊❤
“Donnie Tsunami of the jury , is this your true and correct verdicts ?   - me : fucking right !
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
YESSS!!!!! It's great to see that Blue Wall disappear. More good officers need to start calling the bad ones out.
“ I can’t breathe “ LOL.  Cause I just took a big bong toke!  Happy 420 woot woot
Though his reckless and merciless behaviors are factors number 1 that led to Floyd death, I think this verdict is likely to be overtuned in the court of Appeal based on Maxime Waters foolish comments. Just a thought
Bye scumbag
Monster from 🔥 Cop with no ❤ took a life now you pay with yours sorry Racist Pos
Rip bozo
I'm speechless. Despite evidence of drugs in his body and the guy having his knee on his shoulder blade when cuffing him and not being on his neck. I don't know how I feel about this as its more about mob threats than facts presented.
This is not it they need to arrest all the other officers who murder innocent people's and walk away free. Reason they charge Derek chauvin because they wouldn't like the outcome if they let him go free. Let's see daunte Wright case
Personally it would be a tragedy if I had to go to jail on 4-20 😂😂
He just thought that badge was taking him home.
Blm got what they wanted, poor guy didn't deserved after his heroic act of cleaning society.
Most satisfying 6 minutes on video in a long time... Thank you, jury.
Can you even imagine how many people he's led away in cuffs? And now how he's being led away.
Justice was served its not going to bring him back but George floyd is up there celebrating. Now George floyd can rest in peace condolences to his entire family
Terrorism Won the Day
THANK U GOD THIS RASCIST BUM IS IN JAIL
now watch.... even though justice was served. rightly so, there will still be riots and looting. a lot of folks came out hoping they would have an excuse to steal from footlockers and stores. dont say i told you so
This is already a brand new start to a ton of greater day coming when know for sure justice was definitely served THIS VERY DAY!
Feeling a somber relief right now. So glad the jury made the right decision. At the same time, George Floyd, a man who should still be alive today is gone. I pray that his spirit and family have some greater peace now.
Why the fuck are all people so worked up over this whole thing. Why care bout the people u never met. Now, now dont kill me in the comments.......
Hah pig
Jurors scared out of their minds for themselves and their families. Do what we say or we'll loot and burn down the city! Domestic terrorism.
How unfortunate...now we get to see him get off at a higher court...
Very proud of my city!!!
Injustice served to mob rule, ignorance won today. George took his own life on overdose,  probably because of all the evil things he did.
I was extremely confident in the verdict...my concern is that the judge will fail us and justice will not be served.
Yall do know its to keep from people tearing up the city and he will most likely change his appearance move him out the country change his look start a new life with his family. It's called killing 2 birds with one stone. Look at the non expression on his face he ain't worried. At the end of the day who gone check on him to see if he in his cell or not. Stop playing with me and wake the hell up
I just know that lady who “accidentally” used her taser is scared shitless right now lol
NEW PACK 💨💨💨💨
I hope you never forget what it feels like "To Not Be Able To Breath" Love AMERICA, Justice!
I think he temporarily lost his h sight his eyes was rolling so fast.
Some of you guys praising George Floyd like he's some god when in reality, he was a criminal... I can't wait for him to appeal this verdict and be released.
We did it guys
Can’t feel my face off this Chauvin pack! SHEEESH! 💨
Weird he look so calm. His eyes looked confused  like what guilty lol 😂. Today was a day for justice.
So is racism fixed now? Jesus cause this leftist shit is really annoying af!
Enjoy your retirement in hell. ups!!! I mean in jail.
He "killed" someone who died of drug overdose as autopsy later showed, okay.
Yes, Finally Justice is served for once.
No point in being a cop anymore
I like this ex-donut cop's expression as the jury declared that even though he has a badge he can't just go around killing people... One day we'll wake up demand that a panel of ordinary citizens must approve cops that both graduate academy and also getting hired in any county in this country. In addition they should have that same panel scrutinize their behavior every 6 to 12 months and if they don't make the cut their gone. e.g. the same standard the everyday worker undergoes year after year.
Woohoo, start printing fake bills (just like the FED).
Proud day today!!!! It won't be anything until sentencing
Derek Pack Comin Soon! 🌳💨
I want to be glad, but I don’t think he’s going to spend serious time in jail.
#guilty! 👀
He will walk free when this will be overturned, like Waters comments for example. They want to calm down the mob for now
You could see the tension in the court room just before the verdict was read,Eric Nelson looked hopeless
Cool. I still wanna riot
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
There sure will be an appeal by the defense, inferred from the calmness of the defendant and his defense attorney
Got his ah , lock em up n throw away da key
😞 and you guys believe this
I think its safe to say i have hope for humanity 🙌🏽
What’s really sad is that if George Floyd would of just put his hands behind his back and took his punishment like a man he would still be alive today. F-:k this cop for killing him but just watching him put his hands behind his back and going to face his time it makes you wish George would of did the same. No winners in this tragedy. Rest easy ✊🏿
guilty on all 3 counts, bail revoked, up to a 40 year sentence, and cuffed on national tv. rot in hell chauvin and everyone who defended him
may he rot in prison
Celebrations are in order!
The American clown show continues
Now if only people cared this much for justice when their own community kills their own
Today was a good day.👊👊🙏🙏
Justice is served !
We smoking that Chauvin pack 😤
He was scared scared. Thought he was gonna walk
Yes!!  Jurors got every verdict right!!
This is a result of global protests and decades of civil disobedience and we need to remember that there is hell to fight after we celebrate this murderer's verdict.
He’s gonna appeal come back and get off on 2nd degree manslaughter. Why you think they so calm ? Stay woke ! This won’t make news as much 5 years from now
He never stood a chance....... a person trying to do his job, restraining a career criminal who was resisting arrest !!! George Floyd robbed a pregnant women and pointed a gun at her stomach when she first refused give him money........ I'll er just leave that there
Look at em.. just sitting up there all perched like he knew he was going home
rip america, mob rule won
Pig heads matter!
No riots thank god
fuck this piece of shit. bootlickers love him. hes a hero to them. its only the beginning
U kno George Floyd? Huh
He was guilty. but he also had zero chance of being found not guilty.. solely because  of the city's potentially  being burned down and  looted.
Glorifying a criminal
His eyes when the verdict was read. He just knew he was gonna get off. 😂 “No no, not today! ☝🏽” *Dikembe Mutombo voice*   It was a purrty sight seeing him hauled off in handcuffs! 😂🙌🏽
Time to go burn loot murder in celebration right demonkkkrats socialist dictators if your a cop in these demonkkkrat shit holes quit tomorrow and move South Dakota will treat you right leave the criminals to deal with the criminals
Adam Toledo (latino)  and Christina Englehard (white).. Both killed by opposite color/race. Zero pressssssssss
Derek sleep well tonight!
Don't be fools he might still get special treatment in prison
The badge and gun do not make you superhuman or executioner. Jurors got it right.
Amazing how easy it is to call this justice when doxxing a jury is a likelihood.
This is what war inside a brain looks like.
This should be a mistrial because officer chauvin never really had a fair chance at a fair trial for fear of those blm domestic terrorists and insurrectionists rioting.
Watching a murderous psychopath reacting to this is satisfying.
On 4/20 day nontheless.
All the thumbs down. Hope you poop your pants in public.
His eyes said a lot lmao. He was definitely not feeling that verdict 🤣🤣🤣🤭.
FINALLY JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE!
Good. Fuck him
ON 420,,, going to be one hell of a party "TONIGHT"
Fuck
Great news on 420! Lit 'em up in celebration...fingers crossed.
My prayers got answered Alhamdulilah 🙌🏽 justice was served!
There is hope for Society!  This is Proof!
What a relief
BLACK LIVES MATTER 🙏🏾
There going to appeal because of Maxine waters and the media so to be continued
Praise the Lord Amen 🙏  Finally justice is done Amen🙏
Big Bubba is waiting for you Derek xx 😂🤣
This will be overturned fast as hell 😂😂😂😂 Mad Maxine Waters is ONE reason
The dislikes must be is family
Even lowlife shouldn't be treated like that.
don’t drop the soap derek
Who just watched the case
It’s only right.. he killed that man. Fentanyl didn’t help but let’s be real here. It was awful and all these conservatives (which I am one) need to stop trying to say George just happened to die from drugs while a cop was on top of his neck. Both autopsies ruled that out but it wasn’t a bad defense from his attorneys.
Finally he gets justice ✊🏾✊🏿
Appeal, appeal, appeal. Absurdly unfair verdict for sack of SHIT Floyd.
So cop doing the tough job dealing with these junkies pays the a high price for his service. Obvious jury were intimidated by mob rule.
Do the right thing and we wouldn't have to be here . this goes for everyone.
This is cathartic. Watching the video that was released almost a whole year ago... I felt so sick watching George Floyd die like that. Justice was served today but it’s not the end.
George family got justice
Today was a good day 👏🏾
A verdict to appease the idiot, looting masses
Good
BEAUTIFUL.
Those eyes speak volumes. Thats a broken man, no longer protected by the badge to cause harm upon others. Thats the look of a man panicking and reality quickly setting in
We did it... we can all go home happy🙏🏾😁😀
Justice is finally served!
Step aside Butch!   https://youtu.be/tVRPz6-Tkww
Mic Check 1,2,1,2
Haha all you dumbasses who said not guilty look mad stupid now... y’all in your tan shell too now Pussy
There was an assload of jury tampering. There was mountains of reasonable doubt. This isn’t justice.
Amen!!! Justice!
THANK YOU GOD!! BLACK LIVES ALWAYS HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL MATTER!!🖤
All u had to do was let him breathe
I know what this man did to George is inhuman, but I really feel sorry for him. Am sure his sorry. If only he acted right, he would not have messed his life this way
I feel so much relief. It may be a long way to go, but a step in the right direction is good.
Rip bozo
All these polices officers should watch this.
He was looking crazy asf as the verdict was being read🤣 those eyes were moving quick!
Why he looking stupid like that he not looking bad to the bone now ypu a murderer. Now we gotta get the ones helped you yup
Thank god!! Justice was served!!! This is just the beginning...
Keep your KNEE to your SELF PLEASE😄😊😳
Yes! Yes! Yes! FUCK THE POLICE!
The fucker look suprise at the verdict
The family $27 million settlement went a long way!
He is thinking about how his life sentence is going to be pretty short lived once he is in prison, they won't let him survive long.
JUSTICE
Finally RIP BOZOOOOOO
Chauvin is going to hell, it's over, it's over, that punk gonna get it now
Justice has finally been served correctly.    A certain news station said this is the case in most court proceedings, maybe so but not in cases where an officer is involved.  I do think the majority of officers are good but all the ones that go to court for abuse of power, misconduct etc... are in fact guilty but seem to always be found not guilty. And yes most of those cases are or were against minority's.    And those that are found guilty are the ones that were against white or the rich.     I hope true change is coming. EDIT: HAPPY 420 Edit:. Now I was just listening to the lawyers for Floyd and they mentioned Wright and Toledo's case's.  Wright was driving a car that had expired tags then when they ran his name they saw he had a warrant for his arrest for felony assault and robbery, when wright heard this he tried to run so the officer pulls what she thought was her taser.    She's been charged accordingly and will be found guilty.  Toledo's case was that he and a 20 year old was firing guns at a intersection cops were called and was chasing them, the officer chasing toledo saw (and so did we all through video) a gun, when he dropped the gun simultaneously while turning around happened in a split second. The officers did not see him drop it as he turned. He had a split second to either be shot or shoot and he had no idea this was a 13 year old.    Those are not anything like floyd's case.  So we'll see what happens and I hope justice will be served as correctly as this one.
i love the mic check at the beginning lol
Throw him gen pop asap
Amen...!!!!
YES! This Means No Riots.
Getting excited too early. Wait until the sentencing. He will only get 3 years and then we will see the cover up. Maybe the judge will hug him and give him a Bible.  They didn’t fix his hair before verdict.  No hugs Derrick.
His facial expressions is him realizing his white privilege was revoked
Well hopefully they don't give him a light sentence
YAYAYAYYAEES
Lol I hope he gets well acquainted with Bubba
Retarded Republicans: 👁👄👁
Justice is served
Thank God it’s over now the family can rejoice when ever a man calls on his mother it got to b serious, you know Momma coming ASAP,that was her oldest baby so he was a leader to his siblings and very respectful to his mom you know the oldest child has to watch out for the siblings until Momma get home 🏠 it’s like every time Momma leave the nest they would leave it all up the oldest child
He never stood a chance. He had the state and the terrorists against him. If he was found not guilty the jurors would have all been doxxed, lost their jobs, been attacked etc.
he knew what he did he knew he was guilty he had ZERO remorse.
Glad the jury reached common ground 🔥👋🔥
RIP BOZO
❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏
Rest in peace Floyd they got your killer
5:09 Notice how he doesn't resist arrest and therefore doesn't die. Take note criminals.
Why are you looking like that as though they was suppose to have found you not guilty you live by the sword you die by the sword may God have mercy on your miserable soul
This is moronic. How the hell can anyone with a brain think there was not reasonable doubt? I guess all you have to do is frighten a jury and you get whatever verdict you want. This is a joke.
How long does he have in prison
Go straight to jail do not pass go!!
Best part to watch him get put in hand cuffs
You know what sweetens the deal though? All the YouTubers who are butthurt and calling this a miscarriage of justice, Fucking Bootlickers and their TEARS of impotent rage are delicious.  No TEARS like the TEARS of a BOOTLICKER.  SALTY and DELICIOUS. Not even the Police are Above the law! Don't Drop the Soap Chauvin! Hahahaha!
we still have a long way to go , but we are heading in the right direction ! May you RIP George ‼️ ♥️👏 BLM 💯
The bible says. You can't do wrong and get by.
good, now he'll be in federal prison for the rest of his life. #JusticeWellDone
I loved how well this case was handled, the trial was very stressful for both sides. This case will make history.
Feels good
Wow, justice at last. Just wow.
Amen now you can RIH george..🙏
A great injustice!
Now we need to fight for the rest of these innocent people...young and old (Latinos, asians, whites, blacks) who've been murdered by these abusive murderous thugs All these cops need to be held accountable!
AMEN 🙏 AND LET THE HOUSE SAY AMEN 🙏 GOD IS GOOD AII THE TIME
Justice have been served! Don't riot!
We’ll see how sentencing goes!
YES YES YES!!!!  LESSON  FINALLY TAUGHT AS SHOULD BE🤣
Amen in jesus name thats murder
The race divide grows larger and hatred for cops go deeper. Why would anyone even wanna be a police officer in today’s age when you gotta deal with all the bs?
*How many years?* Hope it's not a slap on the wrist...
Finally he can rest in peace
Hope they get his ass in jail
See when you kill someone this the punishment you should get that was a good 😌 judge 👨‍⚖️ guilty now you can’t kill nobody else
He finna be in jail for 65 years and I don’t feel bad that he gonna be spending the rest of his life behind bars  Justice has been served for George Floyd🥺🤞🏾🕊🙏🏿
It's justice!!
God always seek justice for those that can’t speak for themselves and when u wrong u wrong🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Justice will be color blind!!
The jurors were threatened! The system was corrupted by Waters influences!!!
May the Lords will be done in everyone's life!   Believe on Jesus to be saved! Thats your only way into heaven! Its not of works!
This is sad
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Now please don't let it get overturned or lessened🥰🥰 He deserves every minute in there
