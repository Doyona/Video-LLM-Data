Another CLOWN not Knowing What's He's Talking  About Observing From A Far how TF Is Rj QUICK ND A 2nd Like D Mitch Package Stfu. Did U see what Quick Avg in the P.o shut up man
I’m just finding out this today wondering where’s Quickly at. Have to say this bothers me just as much as letting Jeremy Lin go. I know RJ game wasn’t outstanding but he’s better than Randle and why couldn’t they give them inconsistent Grimes instead! Still mental illness in that front office.
This is a good trade for the Knicks. RJ hit a level and is somewhat inconsistent. Quick also needed an extension, and was going to command a ton of money, more than you want to pay a backup. And the Knicks needed a back up center who can play spot starter minutes because our 5 spot has been decimated by injury.
Damn boy you getting big.

My emotional state went immediately from dread from seeing OG traded (one of my favourite Raptors), to pure joy in seeing that he got moved for IQ (one of my favourite Knicks). I felt like that dude from The Dictator who found out he tested HIV Aladeen.
Anunoby is the best player New York has acquired in a long time.  Very happy new year for me.
Of course the fatty is gonna downgrade the knicks trade
Doesn’t matter who was traded or why. Dreams go to the Knicks to die. They could get prime Lebron Kobe and Steph and still be complete failures as a franchise and team and not make it anywhere. I dare you to prove me wrong with anything that has happened for that team in the last 20 years. Look how pathetically excited Knick fans got last season for accomplishing nothing in real terms. Like the wife who thinks her abusive husband has hope because he washed dishes that one time two weeks after laying hands on her.
Jaylen Brown your next video Sporting Logically 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
Now Knicks need pursue Donovan Mitchell or Zach LaVine ? Toronto need trade Pascal Siakam ASAP
Not sure why we have to have a winner in the deal. I will miss quickly and good luck to rj but the value of og is higher to the knicks than I is for the raptors. Og is a knick style player.  Rj and quickly may shine one day but it doesn't make it a bad deal. The knicks picked up someone who solved a need. Toronto picked up potential.  It can very well be a win win.
Modern day slave trade! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The knicks gave up too much but they got what they needed. Great trade for the raptors though.
...well, the Knicks needed a wing defender. RJ and Josh was getting back down. Scotty Barnes looked like Scottie Pippin. Money Mitch is out but if you tell me He's back healthy next year with Anunoby, Brunson, Randle, Grimes, DiVincenzo, 1st rd draft picks. Slow better than no money.
Since blue / orange blooded, I'm emotionally attached to RJ and IQ. That said it's a huge relief to move their contracts off the books and if OG resigns for a reasonable price this can be a good short and long term deal -- coping a little for getting rid of Quickly in particular. Overall not an earth-shattering move on either end imo
#TRENDING!!!
This was not even close to what the Jazz were asking for in exchange for Mitchell!!!
Maybe RJ is what people are talking about but watchout for quickley taking a leap with scottie passing combination..
This is a offensive league not defensive, rule changes are favoring that, in that case Toronto wins the trade favoring offense over defense
Toronto won the trade... got younger players with higher upside, simple as that.
Knicks got the better of the trade. OG is similar to RJ but plays defense fits with thibs system. Precious is a big body needed up front. As for RJ he will be loved in Canada and has moments but Raptors fan are gonna fall in love with quickly that boy can shoot the lights out. Goodluck resigning him after this year thou.
Why not stick with Siakam instead and see where it goes? Next year we have trade pieces draft pics and cap space ?
I do know one thing people who don’t know basketball or hate NY because they aren’t from here always say the Knicks got fleeced in a trade. Then when it turns out that the Knicks didn’t get fleeced they get very quiet.  Reminds me when y’all was saying “the Knicks got fleeced in ghe Porzingus trade” which was wrong the Knicks won that trade. Then “the Knicks overpaid Brunson” which was also wrong.   Just say y’all are envious of NYers and have that little brother syndrome when it comes to everything about NY.
didnt they want 4 first round picks for mitchell as well that was alot
Wrong trade for New York knicks players  Barrett and Quickley their are good backup player should be trade the center that’s the big problem in New York Knicks !
The way your talking about the trade is that you forgot the Knicks didn't trade those players and a draft pick for just OG. OK Precious and Flynn are not marquis  players but they are NBA players. Flynn is young and new into the league and to me watching him, he seems to be getting better the more minutes he plays, so you can't sleep on him just being a throw in. If Precious doesn't have injury problems he also can be effective, so I think both teams have a chance to benefit from this trade not to mention both teams were afraid that Quickly and OG could have walked at the end of the year from their teams, so we'll see how that goes.
Not even close to the same package as the one for Mitchell. The one for him included multiple firsts. This is one second
Great Move!  #GoKnicks
Love this deal as a Raps fan - OG is one of the most overvalued guy in this league and thankful I won’t have to see Flynn play again
As a Raptors fan, I think its about as good a deal you could have hoped for OG (I don't think it was crazy to turn down 3 firsts from Memphis when you know you're probably looking at mid-20s short of more Ja suspensions). You have two promising players that fit Scottie's timeline and basically a 1st round pick.  Hopefully RJ can fit better be a more consistent scorer with Barnes and Quickley playmaking for him but I like the upside here.
The Mitchell trade package would have involved a LOT more picks than this. Just look at what Cleveland ended up giving up. Besides, OG is a much better fit. Mitchell + Brunson doesn't make sense. Also, there's no reason the Knicks can't add yet another good player down the road. They still have a ton of picks and salary matching.   At this point, RJ is what he is. He's wildly inconsistent and has yet to show he can make open shots at even league average. Quickley is obviously the bigger loss. His shooting has been great this year, and his per 36 numbers look great. But it makes more sense for them to pay OG $40 million than it does for them to pay yet another guard.
worst trade in knicks history . . .
I feel a little bias in this video. You diminish OG value by mentioning his potential contract but don’t acknowledge the overpay contract RJ is currently on. Then you said “RJ value is weird.” Sir that’s putting it very very mildly. His value is in the dumpster. His last 18 games have been abysmal.
I believe the Knicks are gonna make another big trade, and having OG, Brunson, and whoever else they trade for next is a huge positive transition for the Knicks
Knicks would’ve had to pay IQ as well as already having RJ on a new deal. Knicks also couldn’t really consistently close with either IQ or RJ. With Brunson at PG, guys like Donovan Mitchell and Zach Lavine really dont make sense for this Knicks team. OG comes in and is immediately a fit in the starting lineup and closing lineup. Doubt the Knicks go star hunting, they probably take the Fournier contract, Quentin Grimes and those picks and target another high-end role player by the deadline.
RJ and a first would not have been enough to make this deal
Knicks had a surplus of shooting guards on the roster. Eventually this was going to happen. I still think we are one star player away from contending, but this move regardless I get it.
??? Og and RJ are like the same guy
The Knicks still have all their draft picks plus a few others. How do they not have enough assets to make more trades?
Good trade for both.  RJ looks to be a bust
As a Raptors fan, I think its about as good a deal you could have hoped for OG (I don't think it was crazy to turn down 3 firsts from Memphis when you know you're probably looking at mid-20s short of more Ja suspensions). You have two promising players that fit Scottie's timeline and basically a 1st round pick.  Hopefully RJ can fit better be a more consistent scorer with Barnes and Quickley playmaking for him but I like the upside here.
Masai and Webster still have to go.  They're past their expiry
Quickley and a 2nd isn't too much for OG. What are you talking about lol. We can't possibly be overrating RJ still lol. He sucks and is insanely overpaid.
Both teams addressed their needs. Raptors needed a good guard, and Knicks needed a good wing. RJ is the X-factor.
It's win-win. They get to try out a prototypical 3&D wing to see how it works. Next season, Fournier's money allows them to afford him and if he walks, they have max contract money. Quickley is going to be too expensive unfortunately and want a starting spot that he won't get. Also lowkey Achiuwa is very neccesary rn given their need for playable bigs. Next season Hartenstein is a free agent that might go for 8 figures considering the Knick have already been paying him 9 million. Achiuwa is an RFA so they have optionality there.
I just find it funny that everyone (including you) thought RJ’s bum ass could be the center piece of a Donovan Mitchell trade when he wasn’t even enough on his own to get OG.
Just want to say thanks as a Raptors fan for the accurate analysis.  So much of the mainstream stuff comes from people with zero clue.  Surprised you didn’t mention Achiuwa and Flynn, but again, to your credit, it’s probably because you know they are useless and hardly worth the mention.
False. They would have paid much more for Mitchel
Knicks got such a better deal 😂
No the jazz wanted 3 players and 2 or 3 1st picks . Raptors only wanted a 2nd round pic.  Knicks keep there 1st round picks
Personally I think Toronto is retooling this roster rather than rebuilding. Instead of trading quality players for picks I think they will go for younger talent with remaining potential upside. I think this trade signals that Siakam is definitely going to be gone by the deadline as long as a reasonable deal is out there. Poetl and Shroeder are the bigger question marks for me as Shroeder makes no money when it comes to bringing back much in return and Poetl makes too much money for a Center who has shown himself to not be able to stay on the floor when it matters for his current team
We get 4 years of RJ and the foot in the door for Quickley who Tibs inexplicably hated. A++++ times a million
RJ and Grimes and maybe 2 second round pics is what I would have loved to see
Quickley in thsi deal was straight thievery unless he expressed he wanted out of NY..
From a Knicks fan perspective, I literally agree with every single thing you said. This trade does indeed give us financial stability to make a big swing for a star BUT by deciding to trade both quickley AND RJ it really lowers our leverage in the market for a big time player. If theoretically the Cavs were open to trading Donovan, I would expect them to be interested in a deal where they get like 5 firsts and salary matchers like Fournier and another player. If we had RJ OR QUICKLEY I think the cavs would find a deal like that way more logical. Hope this trade works out for us and I hope OG plays well
As an individual player sure OG isn’t outstanding but he fits like a glove for this team
This is not close what Mitchell would cost not sure why u think it is
As a knick fan im sad they included Quickley in this trade smh
The Knicks are making another move yea they let Barrett and IQ go but you got a steady wing and 7 or 8 1st round picks still.
Do you really think  IQ staying with the Raptors than uou are deilluioned. OG will resigned with the knicks.
Did you make this video assuming that multiple firsts were involved? You mention “draft compensation” and compare it to the Mitchell package… This is no where close to a Mitchell package.
Comparing this to the Donovan Mitchell trade is asinine
The Jazz wanted 3 unprotected firsts plus RJ Quickley and Grimes.  This nothing like that trade
I'll miss RJ and Quick. Knicks office must have a plan to bring in someone else in F/A
The Raptors have gotten better offensively. Immanuel QUICKLY has a better upside than OG. RJ is an upgrade from Flynn. Siakam and Barnes now have something to work with going down hill
Quickley will be a RFA this season and wilk command $25M plus, doesn’t really makes sense for both him and Brunson to be there specially if he will never get the minutes he needs. Knicks will rather pay for OG vs IQ + RJ. It’s not like the Spida situation at all, nor it should be. Jazz wanted all the young players and picks for Spida.
I wonder what the Knicks next move is
I don’t think it’s similar to the DMitch package, Jazz were asking for 4 first rounders on top of all this
Now toronto has to pony up and pay BOTH Barrett and Quickley
I like this trade for both teams. B+ for the Raptors, B for New York
Actually, the Knicks got a good deal. They traded Quickly + 2nd round pick for OG, and got rid of RJ bad contract as a plus. Now they got an efficient scorer and a great wing defender. 😂😂
Plz stop shaving ur beard dawg, u look great w it.
You are way off it’s obvious the Knicks are going to trade for a big name through their draft capital. They have 8 picks.  You will see the Knicks make another big trade in next few weeks
OG is not worth maybe even Quickly let alone
the mitchell trade was RJ + like 3 1st round picks...how is that comparable
That is NOwhere remotely near the Donovan Mitchell package. You're WAAAYY off on that. Wojnarowski reported that in early July the Knicks offered Barrett, Obi Toppin, Mitchell Robinson and three unprotected first-round picks for Mitchell
Fuck bro i just KNOW Immanuel is gonna start cooking bro this is gonna go down as ass for NY
OG doesn't make NY better
If it's the Pistons 2nd round pick, isn't then #15 overall?
Who said the NYK were done trading? I hope. 😅
Hope RJ develops in the Raptors
What's the point.. still not competitive.. They just want to look like they're doing something?
I would've tried like hell to keep quickley.. but he's getting paid next year, not sure he would've or could've stayed
How do you not mention the contract situation…. That’s the entire deal 🤦‍♂️
This guy doesnt know much about the knicks
Now Siakam to OKC!
My dude, I get that you love basketball, but becoming rounder is not part of the grind 😅. Stay healthy, man!
Great trade for Toronto in my opinion siakem should definitely be the next domino to fall get some draft capital and a couple young players and The rebuild is done without the tanking be able to transition into the Scotty Barnes era. I believe ( don't hate me for this ) that Emmanuel is actually better then R.J and will probably show it in a bigger role. Plus letting vanvleet go for free makes a little more sense to me if they had a deal like this already planned. The Knicks however gave up alot but I'm sure they probably had to outbid some teams, seing that almost half the league has been interested in him. I don't think they moved the needle much with there ceiling still being a #4 seed in the east. It does fill there defensive holes at the same time I'm scard to see how bad their bench will be now. Resigning OG will keep a valuable asset on the team and they still can trade Randle some draft pics and maybe grimes to be able to bring in some talent. A grade Toronto B- for Knicks. Both teams are probably not done making moves that'll explain why the trade happened so soon 🕊️
Y’all do realize that quickly is gonna get paid this offseason and his contract plus RJ would of been way more than what OG is gonna get.
Please for the love of god, start Quickley. In 24 minutes, he averages 15 points on 40% from 3. We don’t have a lot of good guards and also what do we got to lose. He’s on Scottie’s timeline and complements his skills so much better. Man, I can’t believe we got him.
Heres a stat for you. OG has never scored 20pts or more against Boston..
You will forever be missed OG 😭
Didn’t you make a video a couple days ago that Raptors are a disaster? Go for walk.
I hope they flip RJ, not sure he's a good fit with Barnes in Toronto
This is a move to set the Knicks up to replace Randle as the #1 scorer/star down the road.  OG will move to the 4 and Hart to the starting 3.  Brunson will become the second star and they can fit in a new star at the 2, the 4 or 5, regardless of defensive ability cuz Hart and OG will shutdown elite wing scorers like Tatum and Brown.    Meanwhile, they can still make the playoffs and possibly win a round with OG at 3 and Randle at 4.
IMO a dumb trade for Knicks. Anunoby is on an expiring contract so they could just try to sign him in the off-season and trade away Barrett. Plus I see Quickley as more valuable to the Knicks because they are playoff team but not a title contender so making this trade doesn't get them closer.
Knicks still have enough 1st round picks and players to get a star at SG.
This is why nobody should trade with Masai Ujiri. Lol what a rip off. And OG is gonna be a free agent after next year lol wtf
Toronto is getting a hidden gem in Quickley.   As a Knick fan I am exciting to finally get a solid 2 way player.
Knicks won the trade by far. RJ is a bust look at all his stats, and quickly asking for 25k a year and Knicks not giving that for a backup PG so he’s leaving anyway. 2nd round pick means nothing. Knicks get A+ wing and good big man. This is the 1st of 2 trades for the Knicks
I disagree, I think the price was low for NY. Toronto seemed like they wanted a higher price for OG.
They smoking dope if they think Brunson fina beat teams playing one on 5 in the playoffs cuz we all know Randle fina turn into a magician
Seems to me that the Knicks deserve the A. No one mentioning that NY got Precious too
How can you give tha raptors an A grade when they could've traded him last year for four first round picks?
Immediately after this trade the raptors proceeded to lose against the PISTONS and help them break the 28 game losing streak
OG is a great player he’s is going to breakout
I think the original deal for Mitchell was 4 firsts, IQ, Rj and Mitch Robinson. I'm much happier with this deal.
Grizz fan but Knicks next deal needs to be for Lavine to send Mitch and Evan with 3 1st Pistons/Wizards/Knicks 24 1st. Allows them a complete lineup with Brunson/Lavine/OG/Randle/Isiah. Next year they can potentially upgrade and go all in with Mitchell deal for Lavine and picks
And Detroit snaps their losing streak... Thanks to Toronto LOL.
I really love quickly.  But sadly the Knicks are pretty redundant. Barret was our best driver and finisher on fast break.  The Knicks were going to have to pay quickly this offseason. Now they will pay OG instead.  They lacked a real wing and needed more defense.   Once devenchenzo became a shooting threat and a better fit then quickly. Quickly became redundant.
Love that we are getting RJ in returned was pissed tell I heard that that buts awesome welcome.back home RJ .. I love OG may you get all the best you deserve G
I think an A is too high of a grade for Toronto.  You talked about paying OG, but now Toronto has to pay RJ’s contract and pay quickly.  Combined they will make than OG.  Toronto would have been better off taking more draft capital in the trade.  Quickly was drafted 25th, Maxey was drafted 21st.  Teams can find really good players even later in the first round.  Toronto is trying to rebuild like Indy did by staying some what relevant, but they need to hit on a couple more draft picks and the more you have the better chances you have of one or two hitting.  I think Toronto waited too long to make this trade.  For NY again they would have had to pay Quickly and now they don’t.  If they want another star they can now send out Randle or a combination of Fournier, Grimes, and possibly Robinson depending on who they target.  I don’t think OG is a max player and with RJ going out will be easily under the tax next year
It’s breaks my heart as a Knicks fan seeing RJ and Quickley go. But if we kept the same team and paid both of them, the team probably wouldn’t have gotten past the 2/3 round. With the amount of money they would’ve had to been paid. Hopefully we can pick someone else up, preferably a more offensively minded center. And make a push.
Knicks can use Evan’s contract and a pick or two to go get a scoring guard to replace IQ
I love that we got a Canadian kid, now get rid of pascal or trent for something good and we can atart to build a new culture around this team
Doesn’t make a lot of sense for the knicks…like they need a star, not an elite role player is og anunoby. I don’t get it at all this doesn’t move the needle for them.  Good for RJ Barrett going to Toronto and home I think he could turn into an all star there
OG, Achiuwa, Flynn to Knicks. RJ, IQ and a 2nd rd pick via DET to Raps. Knicks needs a legit wing since last season, and they have a glut of guards. They also need a back up center since Mitch out for the season. RJ came crashing down to earth since the migraines and IQ wants starter money for an extension. How is this a B- for the Knicks other than clickbaiting.
That Toronto GM played this office.  Portland offered Toronto much more substantial package and they passed.
only thing O.G doing better than both r.j and quickley is defending other than that i dont think it was really worth it
Raptors A. Knicks B-. The Knicks are going to have to pay OG the bag.
love this trade. RJ was a bust. as a 3rd round pick, RJ gave us nothing bad inconsistency and bad shooting.
OG Anunoby is one of the best wing defenders in the league plus he can be a good offensive contributor while playing mostly off-ball. He'll command a huge contract next off-season though.
Knicks won this deal
This only becomes excellent if Knicks also get Dejounte Murray.
OG has the physique of Barrett and the hair of Quickley 😂
OG gonna walk into the Knicks wanting playoffs. Damn well knowing playoffs is a year or two away
Maybe the Knicks are clearing cap space to try to get another star in free agency.
RJ welcome home, this N will thrive, Brampton bloods, poping off in B- town
The best thing about this trade is that i dont have to look at flynns face anymore or watch precious putting more effort into adjusting his dreadlocks than playing the dam game. Oh, and as a double or triple bonus, i dont have to hear that stupid name anymore, either. Seriously,  who the hell names there baby, precious. But all jokes a side, there is a reason why fans of both teams seem to be convinced that they won the trade before a single game with the new addition has even happened, and i balive its because they no what the other team is really getting with those acquired palyers, while the other team balives there getting much more, if that makes any sence. Let me say it this way, you see, Raps fans are happy because they've watched OG play inconsistent ball all season long, Some nights, he shows up and has a decent, game putting up respectful numbers, while most nights it appeard as if he could care less about the game i front of him and would rather be someware else likat at a club or something. And raps fans aren't having any of it anymore, we've seen enough over the years of players like this that come here to Toronto and fall victim to the night life and rather club it up then prepare for next nights game. Also, another thing that raps fans are aware of that the knicks fans probably aren't aware of and why would they be, a is that OG is a bit of a snowflake. One lil cut on his finger, and he's out for 3 weeks, slight exaggeration, but not really, he seems to spend more time on the injured list for they silliest of excuses more then he actually plays. Aslo flynn and precious just straight up suck lol no seriously, they areworth nothing more other then to be used as flint to start a fire, fillers or trades i mean. Knicks will find this out reall soon. And as far as the knicks fans go, welmits harder for me to speak on there behalf being how im not a kicks fan but id say its pretty simple and fairly obvious why they are also appearing to be pleased with this trade and id say it probably most likely do to the fact that RJ hasnt lived up to there expectations im guessing. Hes had an inconsistent year this season. Maybe not putting up strong numbers, perhaps a drop off from last season i could be wrong bout that im just taking blind shots at why they be happy to see him go but there must be a a preety obvious reason for it otherwise why would they be heavily applauding this trade so confidentiality. Both sides of fans actually have responded in this way, being confident and speaking admirably about their teams decision in this somewhat unusual and rare december trade. Personally, i think it was a bit of a lateral move for both teams. But only time will see. But if i had to bet on it, id say raps won based off the fact that RJ appears to have the most potential out of the two and has a much higher ceiling to raise his skil level, ware as OG appears to have hit his ceiling and would rather set the roof the roof the roof is on fire in da clubs rather then work on his game anymore. Also, raps are in desperate need of players that can make buckets consistently, Raps offense has been atrocious this season, having painfully long stretches between scoring. Oh, and yeah,  being a raps fan, im obviously biased and just sayn all this cuz i really hope this trade works out for us, regardless if it works for NYC or not. I mean dont forget the knicks did just acquire one of the better defenders in the league, OG was the raps go to defender for opposing teams star offensive player. only time will tell and soon we will see which team faired better. That is all, and to all a goodnight.
What does “Barret is going to be there” mean ? He is negative asset!
Knicks are dumb building around Randle and Brunson sorry 2 iso's who don't defend
Barret is a salary dump so that was taken into consideration .
go raptors RJ
What if the Knicks traded OG, Grimes, multiple first for DMitch?
I love the trade for Toronto, cause they get a guard that they desperately needed and someone who’s ready to start… Quickley off the bench was averaging 15 off the bench and 40% for 3!!!  Barrett is a Canadian born player, hometown hero and in a system that could cater to him developing more…   For the Knicks, the bright side is that OG is a good wing, he can do two and/or the three which is excellent. Having Achiwa will alleviate some stress off of Randle cause Randle plays a lot of high minutes and when he does playing a lot of minutes in a row, his inconsistency shows
The Donovan Mitchell package????????????? You're bugging
Im happy with this trade. RJ was stagnant and inefficient despite getting major minutes and we cant pay quickley so getting OG who plays excellent defense and spaces the floor for Ju and Brunson? Im all for it.
The grading here: Raptors A Knicks B-. Meanwhile, ESPN Kevin Pelton says Raptors C - Knicks A -.  Ugh?! 🙄
Rj barrett . He stinks.
Jeremiah 29:11 - For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. God bless! Jesus is the way and saves! Psalms 62✝🤍
This is not the “Donovan Mitchell package” Cleveland would’ve wanted Barrett, IQ and multiple 1st The Knicks still have a couple good young players (admittedly not the same draw as IQ and Barrett) plus all the draft capital.   You mention having to pay OG…well The Knicks would’ve had to pay Quickly this off season too. So in essence what it would’ve cost to retain IQ + Barrett’s salary is still going to be less annually.  It’s like when The Knicks make a move the automatic is to assume they got hosed and the other GM was so smart!   There is a realistic possibility that the net of this trade is RJ and a second for OG.
It’s going to be so nice not having to see Achiewa make the dumbest mistakes anymore.
Quickley is a FA at the end of the season.... he's outta there! GUARANTEED!!!!!
They can use the pick to draft Zach Edey
Og is not worth all that😂😂😂
OG ain’t gone resign with the Knicks dog that man gone go there ball out decline that 2024 player option, show he can handle a bigger role and sign with another team someone gone overpay for his services
Great for both teams. Though ridiculous take from the video. It's a 2nd round pick. OG is the best player in the deal. Knicks also still have a lot of draft capital and can still upgrade if needed.
The Knicks finessed. The Knicks don't build through the draft. They can plug in any available high-level player who wants to play there.
I think this was a great move for the knicks the fact they didn’t give up any Draft picks. I can see them going all in on Mitchell now
Knicks fan here. I come in peace. ✌🏿 You can keep RJ but we’re coming back for Quickly. 🏆💰✊🏽👉🏿 discuss.
Picking Randle over Rj/quick will haunt the knicks
RJ Barrett is trash and makes teams worst but Quickley could become a star. This was an even trade for both teams
As a Knicks fan I don't like the fact that both RJ and IQ got traded. It shouldve been RJ and Grimes or McBride. I get that IQ was prob going to leave but his trade value is way higher than what the got in return
The trade is awesome you right..............for Toronto unfortunately. The price is way too high for OG
Welcome Rj And Immanuel to the north, as for OG we are going to miss you and wish you nothing but the best
With the kind of mentality that Thibs puts into his coaching style, it’ll benefit OG and Precious with their defensive skills. Flynn will probably be waived though
This guy is clueless.
Still have the same opinion as it's not multiple picks but just a 2nd round pick
awesome for the Raptors. We just got fleeced.
The Knicks need a strong role player/ star SG and a star defensive Center. The Knicks need a pass first player badly.
Knicks suck
you rushed your grade. no first round picks, Achiuwa is a rotation big for the knicks. no need for the knicks to pay $50mil for barrett and quickly and just pay $~32 mil for OG
Oh yeah a second round pick and those 2 players definitely is a mitchell trade package… What are you on about?
Terrible trade on both ends. Raptors need to rebuild. Trading for for Barrett means nothing.
In my opionion its win-loss for raptors. Raptors gave up on a good defender  who started to play on his own like trying to make up his own shots which is not his playstyle. But they got really good offensive player like RJ  and in my  opinion a 6th moty player caliber. So raps get RJ and IQ but they are losing Og and some two scrubs.
Quickly wanted out. Sad to see him go but RJ is pure trash
Knicks won this trade by a mile. Rj sucks. Masai failed O.G big time by not getting rid of Pascal and letting O.G get a chance at a bigger role. Now we still got bum ass Siakam on the roster and are still in the position...Middle Of The Pack!!!
Stupid trade for the Knicks. Quickley is important to the team.
I’m just glad a move was made. It’s nice to see Toronto has a native player but I would’ve traded Julius if I’m the Knicks. I watched him absolutely quit on the team. Unforgivable.
That's not the Donovan Mitchell trade package, they gave up 1 second round pick hahaha. RJ Barrett sucks so the Knicks offloaded his contract and gave up a player in Quickley they didn't want to pay big money.
This could backfire really bad.. we will see
How does NY want to get better? They actively got worse this trade sucks. Just a typical Knicks fuck up
As a New Yorker, RJ was not striving here in N.Y. He was inconsistent offensively and I think we needed OG  Anunoby.
Why didn’t they take my Grizzlies offer last year? It was better than this deal.
Knicks need a true star.
Barrett cant shoot and is a decent defender Og is a improved shooter and a elite defender. Knicks just gave Raptors there guys who care more about shots than winning. Knicks will be much better Raps just have more mouths to feed.
RJ is not a asset and Knicks need defense in a wing. I think this is a fair trade because now in knicks open up a roster spot to bring in a superstar and they unloaded a bust in RJ Barrett. I’m going to miss quickly because he is a budding superstar, and I hope OG works out.
Idk if taking Quickley is a good choice tho
who would have believed that a team i have disliked for over 30 years, and enjoyed their misery, The NY Knicks would come through for us again....i am old enough to remember all the success the Charles Oakley/Marcus Camby was for the Raptors, he was helpful for our first playoff run, and though it didn't last, it was a positive memory  then there was the Bargnani trade, thank you for that one  and now this one, cause even if OG remains a star/superstar, the fact we have begun to rebuild with youth and draft picks (instead of staying pat), makes this trade a big Win for the Raptors, bigger still if Barrett has a long/productive career....at this point he doesn't have to be a superstar, but if Barrett, Barnes, and Dick can play well and grow together, life is good
I love the addition of OG and that's someone I've said should be swapped for RJ but The Knicks will regret Trading quickley.
I think Knicks still get Donovan Mitchell....its invetible
Rj barrets value is like a bag of fritos at worst and a bag of hot Cheetos at best, 2nd rounds picks are useless so its basically a one for one trade. Knicks win the trade.
With the new three superstars on one team done and these mid-range guys are going to become way valuable
I would give grimes instead of quickley
Knicks would've had 2 pay quickley a 100 mil that would've been 4 100 mil guys and none a superstar
Bruh they literally just upgraded their back court this trade makes both teams better how does this make them worse im done
The most pointless trade really. Neither team gets better with this
sad to see og go as a raptors fan
i literally said yesterday that i believe Masai had lost his touch, and that when you used to hear nothing from him, it was because he was cooking, but that now, he had lost his touch...i have never been happier to be wrong...i will miss OG, for sure, but to get this haul, not just Barrett, not just a player and pick...Happy Freakin' New Year
This is a terrrible trade by the Knicks.  Literally makes them worse
OG in thibodeau’s system 👌🏽
Crazy deal Knicks will be solid but do like the move for the future of Toronto
And fans of every other team are sad today to miss out on OG…
My guess is the Knicks had to give up Barrett and Quickley due to a bidding war. It took both of those guys to outbid other offers, other teams weren’t willing to risk as much as the Knicks on a guy who is due a contract.
As a raps fan, we should've done the 3 picks trade with Memphis grizzlies
Dumb question: is this deal early enough that those guys are potentially eligible to be moved again this season?
Awesome?? This is fkn horrible
OG is perfect for the Knicks, and this coming from a Raps fan. He is literally top 3 point defenders in the entire NBA. He is a monster and if you actually follow closely what he does to key players, he's locked down huge players time and time again for us.
RJ and IQ are vastly overrated assets. It’s crazy it went from no to 3 firsts to yes to depreciating assets with no picks. Also, weird on the Knicks part to go for basically just better RJ. Randle and RJ didn’t fit well together so you go and get…a better version of RJ? That doesn’t stylistically fix the core problems C- for the Raptors and B- for the Knicks.
Raps got a lot better. Exactly what I wanted to happen. Unreal
It's the Donovan Mitchell package without losing the first round picks
Great deal for toronto bc OG was leaving anyways and now they have Barrett for 4 years
The Knicks just saved money, think about it IQ is going to demand over $20M per year, if the Knicks kept IQ and Barrett, you would have 4 players making over $20M a year along with Mitch, Donte, and Hart making $10M or more. The Knicks needed to consolidate their team. Plus if this doesn’t work out with OG, guess who gets to make a sign and trade this off season? The Knicks, most teams will not have the cap space to sign OG outright so sign and trade makes the most sense. Lastly, OG is probably one of the most valuable players who is not an All Star and by having him, it depreciates the market and makes it harder for other teams to improve. So, it’s a win for the Knicks, even if people scratch their head about the deal
Toronto won because of quickly
Raps A  Knicks A-  OG is upgrade over barrett and he fix better in what knicks need right now. Immanuel quickly is RFA  at the end of the year and barrett is ok but getting any value back for og is also a win
Mitchel in New York doesn’t make sense, to have two undersized guards doesn’t work. I like this deal even though I would of just done RJ and a 1 first rounder or even 2 but keep Emmanuel but it is what it is
also does that make the knicks really better?  im skeptical im happy for Rj allthough maybe he will break out in toronto maybe not but i feel like he needed a fresh start
No it’s not if Iam a Knicks fans I’m throwing my hands rn you trade RJ Barrett a fan favorite and Quickly… but rj back home so
I think RJs value was negative or neutral at best. He's there to help balance out the salary. Raps target was Quickley. Raptors also get DET 2nd round, which will be like a late 1st rounder.
One thing you forgetting Tucker is that the Knicks still have or expiring deal with Evan Fournier
NY paid too much for a role player
Great deal for the raps. Not sure how much this helps the Knicks offensively...but i understand you have to slow down Tatum, Brown, Middleton, Jimmy etc
Both these teams sucked before the trade, they might suck worse after 😂 divencenzo shouldnt be on an nba roster he’s the issue on the knicks
Knicks positioning to get Donovan Mitchell
Stop shaving your beard fam. That aint it.
Raps fleeced the Knicks
lmao this is a bad trade for the Knicks 😂  they're not doing anything significantly more with this trade  they barely moved their own needle!!
This looking like the Bargnani trade, Raptors fleecing the Knicks again. Too much given for OG and knowing that they will have to pay him the max in the summer, they will be locked with this mid core for a while.
You find it hard to believe they’re not gonna be worse??? This trade makes the Raps immediately better!
Context is different now for Mitchell. Deal didnt get done with IQ this summer so now he is an expiring. Spida would of cost us these players and at least 3 first rounders. As a knicks fan it really hurts to lose Quick in these deal, but he is a starting caliber 1, eventually wants to get paid like one, but we already have Brunson. I give this trade an A for Toronto and a B for NY. However the Knicks still have the most picks to trade in the League. I wouldnt be surprised if Leon makes another move before next season.
knicks got robbed fr
quickly was putting 20+ pts off the bench…. yet we still have fournier……
I would wait for Pascal Siakam availability and go all in
Happy for RJ he was a trouper for us plus he's home in Canada. OG will help us around the basket plus a good defender
great pick up, you’re just um not winning a chip with randle
Raptors definitely catching an L to the Pistons tonight
Quickly was leaving after this season anyway
I think RJ is going to be great with the Raptors he’s going home to Toronto he’s out of the crazy New York media market that’s been dogging him for a while now it’s a real deal fresh start that’s going to do him good OG on the Knicks will make them surprisingly better on defense But overall i think there gonna have a lack of offense now
Knicks fans been wanting mitchell for years and theyre gonna get stuck paying OG😂
Why?😂
Thibs bout to turn OG into jimmy butler 2.0
Wish Knicks kept quickley could have traded Fournier or Grimes or McBride instead.
Bro needs a beard in the worst way
How would NY match salary unless they give up on JR or MR
Quickly is a restricted free agent Knicks probably was going to lose him anyway so they might as well get something back instead of losing him for nothing
The Raptors absolutely robbed the Knicks
Lol smh
Dude we could have gotten 3 or 4 first rounders for him a year ago...
Knicks want his defense every thing else is a bonus for them plus size to help with Robinson out . B- ? Dumb … Knicks keep all 1st rd picks leaving door open to get anyone they want considering logical cost not if team is willing to part . Knicks are setting up big with this deal
It depends if they resign Imannuel Quickly but getting Detroit's second round pick which is going to be #31 is ok
Good trade for the Knicks!  They are out of Barrett's contract and don't have to pay Quickly who is due for an extension.  Knicks can use their funds to resign OG.  Knicks have enough guns to come off the bench in Hart and DiVincenzo.  I will miss Quickly, but to get quality you have to give up quality and Barrett would not have been enough.
Knicks A raptors B
The bad trade we knew was coming
Cant respect your opinion if you think this is a good trade for NY. They just lost a TON of offense and got only alittle better defensively  Edit: *NY
I don’t think this was a bad trade for the Knicks. Losing IQ sucks, but they weren’t gonna be able to pay him in the offseason anyways.
Honestly as a person who wishes nothing but the worse for the Knicks because of ownership. I think this move is fine. Even if og doesn't work out you gave up cap space and guy who wasn't really getting mins on your team and a second. It's a win win sadly
Ouch...RJ to average 25 getting away from knicks duo.
OG is a thibs player #bullsfan
OG a "massive contract" with 15ppg
Looks like RJ come back home
The raptors have to trade pascal before 12 tonight, if not the team he's traded too can only offer him 84 million
its only a 2nd round pick as well. Knicks got to keep all their 1st round picks.
Masai Webster (yes I know I combined them) waited too long to trade OG.  If he wanted to trade OG then it should have been last year.
This trade is going to age horrendously for the Knicks.  Sure, they got a player perfect for their team, but Quickley & RJ are ridiculously young and are going to THRIVE as starters next to Scottie.
This seems like way too much for OG in my opinion.
Keep in mind OG Agent is knicks presidents son .. see how when brunson was a FA he was the steal of FA & knicks got him for hella cheap considering everything hes doing, i truly believe thats bc his dad is part of the knicks staff.. now i can see something very similar happening with the knicks hes gonna sign for a big deal but not as big as if he was going to any other team. Reason why also cavs wanted mitchell.. its cause his dad is part of the knicks staff so i truly believe this is deeper then what fans see
Spot on knicks over paid rj and a first should have been the trade
Sad day as a knicks fan WTF?!
thanks for the breakdown, one thing though. IQ will be the starter on this team, not "at times". theres plenty of well respected NBA guys who think hes in line for the next maxey type breakout, in what world does he come off the bench for a 30 year old career backup on a mid lvl exception deal? lol thats crazy imo. dennis was benched as a starter with flynn and trent as our only other guards...
Great deal for Toronto
Pretty clear that Mitchell is their next move
I’m sorry RJ is not developing he’s not a good shooter and not a good defender this is definitely a good deal for the Knicks!!
Raptors won this trade easy imo why not get Siakim if your the knicks OG and barrett are pretty even but they lost there six man in quickly
Knicks got also Achiuwa and Flynn, not informed?,
1:45 It's the Mitchell package without the draft compensation, so a very good deal for the Knicks.
They could not have gotten Mitchell for RJ, Quickley and a second round pick...
They had to pay for quickly also what you talking about bro . Plus they got off rj barret contract. You don’t know what you talking about bro . Dumped a contract of a severely inconsistent barret and don’t have to sign quickly under size guard in quickly
FUCK YEAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH RAPTORSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
OG has a real knack for getting injured! I'm glad to see 2 young players coming back. Let's go, Raps!
Precious achiuwa very underrated asset clearly
Love this trade for the knicks , now we can dump Fournier for a valuable role player w the picks.
That loss to Orlando last night must've struck a nerve
Celtics fan here. Don’t like this trade from an outside perspective maybe I’m wrong but quickley was starting to come into his own I thought. Thoughts?
This is going to turn out bad for the knicks. They dropped two way younger guys. Both with a lot of potential. Garbage trade just for one player who is overhyped for his defense. His defense will not make up for rj and quickleys offense. Toronto on the other hand, did great.
Trade Randle
The Raptors fleeced the Bricks
Raps should trade Siakam ASAP for a young player maybe Keegan Murray or Jalen Johnson and tank this season so they get a Top 6 pick that won’t convey to the Spurs. Then use the draft to either trade for a young star or use it to draft a guard or center and start the rebuild. The Raps have potential to be amazing 3-4 years from now
Bro wtf are you talking about? Danny Ainge was asking for RJ Barret Iq Grimes and 5 firsts for Donovan lol. The fact that the Knicks are also getting Precious Achuwa while keeping most draft capital is quite impressive.
Knicks had a surplus of shooting guards on the roster. Eventually this was going to happen. I still think we are one star player away from contending, but this move regardless I get it.
OGA ain't a "star"...Quick will be, soon and for a looooong time. You guys win
I feel like donovan Mitchell is coming once his contract is up and the knicks would rather pay Mitchell than quickley
Lmao, just gloss over the terrible contract that is Rj Barrett who couldn’t handle being a third wheel and can’t defend a lick.
Knicks are dumb for giving up Quickly, especially when Brunson is out or gets hurt.
The issue is that now all the Knicks have space for is at two guard. They need a two-guard star...They have a point guard, a small and big forward and only now have to get a star at two guard.. Someone like a Middleton-type player.
Welcome home R.J. 👏
Genius this trade makes it totally clear that the Raptors are going to resign Siakam and aren't rebuilding at all.  Raptors basically gave away 1 of their 3 Really Good Fowards in OG not for draft picks, but for players in RJB & Quickley to add to Barnes and Siakam.
Honestly one of the better breakdowns of this trade I’ve seen so far GO RAPS
Kinda wished it was pascal instead of OG 😅.
Like it for both teams! I would give them both A’s.
Knicks got a steal
I don't like this deal for the Knicks should have been grimes and quick
Knicks fan here - some information you missed, Quickly is a restricted free agent. He wanted 25mil a year on the Knicks, you would imagine that number goes up if he’s the raptors starter. And he has talked about seeing himself as a starter. Which wasn’t gonna happen on the Knicks  I was expecting them to move Quick in a sign and trade over the off-season.   Also RJ’s inconsistency as a defender and in the offense makes me question his actual value.  And lastly the Raptors could have got more had they moved OG sooner I still think they held off trading him for to long
I can’t believe Knicks gave up both Barrett and Quickley for OG..
As a Knicks fan I’ll explain quickley wasn’t going to resign with them he was the extra piece and RJ wasn’t getting minutes his 20 mill a year would go to a star and OG will get Fourniers money when they move or trade him for a 2guard , so thats why they were included..but in my opinion I think the Knicks aren’t done they’re looking for a 2G that’s can space and handle the ball
This guy is a joke comparing what the jazz were asking for to what the Knicks gave the raptors. The Knicks only gave 2 round pick or picks. The Knicks also got two more players in this deal. Don’t know what you are smoking
Masai Ujiri masterclass
If I was a Toronto fan I would want the org to go after every Canadian player in the NBA.  amazing talent and the national team was exceptional. But that’s just me
Raptors did this trade today ahead of the Pistons game, so obvious.
OG is more or less what we needed, he ain't a ball hog and can turn up the shooting, RJ was good, not great and didn't gave us something that we didn't had already
If the Raptors snap Detroit's losing streak, the whole NBA will laugh at them
Knicks f*caked hip so bad
I think the Knicks deserve an A for this trade! Getting rid of the RJ contract that they clearly didn’t want to give him and IQ isn’t worth the contract he wants right now. This move makes sure the Knicks won’t stay in the middle of the pack for the next 5 years. At most 2 years because they still have their 1st round picks and young players on the roster to trade for a big fish to be the final piece to become a contender. If the Knicks can get Donovan on this roster then they are true contenders!!!
Bad trade for both teams. OG was going to be a free agent this summer. The knicks grossly overpaid for a rental of a talent on the same level of barret. They could have been an even swap. Quickly really hurts the knicks guard depth. For the raptors you traded one of your few 3 pt threats for non shooting parts who play the same position/style as everyone else already on the raptors. Sometimes it feels like front offices do stuff just to present the illusion they are doing their jobs.
Question is, will this trade improve or worsen the Raptors winning  percentage going forward? Are they trying to make the playoffs with this move, or trying to keep their top-6 protected 2024 pick?
RJ in Canada is tuff 😎
No it’s not, he’s a glorified Lu Dort.
OG is not worth a huge contract because he is always hurt.
I don’t know what the draft compensation is yet but I’m sure as hell it ain’t going to be what the Jazz was asking for. The Jazz wanted a ton of first round picks. Come on my guy you can’t compare the two
The knicks now only have 1 option. Trade for a player who will be free agent this year using  Fournier salary, Grimes and 2 draft picks. All signs point to Demar Derozan
Masai does it again ....fleeced the Knicks 👍
As a Knicks fan I hate this trade and Toronto just got a star in IQ. Barrett is just ok snd a glue guy. But IQ is going to break NYs heart. I hate it.
I love OG, much respect to him but it's a F for the Knicks, paid way too much and they're still not even close to being a contender. That's the kind of overpay for a team that's going "all in" and that's most certainly not the Knicks' case
I could see Raptors keeping PS now but moving GTJ next few weeks as he is not as good off bench and I think RJ will start.
Damn Tucker been eating good huh
This is all about Scottie Barnes. Toronto had 3 players playing in the same space. For NY it losting where besides Bucks and 76ers and Celtics. Now Magic is coming up. They had to do something. They can still get Dononvan. In free agency. Cause he already said that.
Knicks want mikal bridges
Clearly Raptors won, Immanuel Quickley is super underrated!
I don’t have faith in RJ tbh
The Knicks would’ve had to trade RJ & IQ with 4 1st round picks for D Mitch
I wouldn't have traded Barrett and a 2nd or Quickley and a 2nd for Anunoby. Possibly I would have made either of those trades for Siakam. Maybe not, especially with Quickley. Quickley is the 2nd coming of Lou Williams. It's been 50 years since the last Knick championship. At least I saw two. With the present management, I won't be around to see the next.
Knicks are suddenly dangerous in the conference finals legit contenders.
NYK has good picks but many will move to next year so they can keep building.
Tell me raptor fans can OG shoot the 3 or handle the ball  ??? And I bet y’all RJ gonna play better for the raptors than he did for the Knicks since there no julius randle on Toronto begging for the ball every play.. Getting Quickley makes me think the raptor won this trade
I think it's important to realize that despite OG being the centerpiece for the Knicks, and a defensive-minded wing they desperately needed, this trade also gives them a solid back-up PF in Achiuwa.  The Knicks had Randle, Randle...and Randle to be a legit PF.  The team was small and it hurt them defensively (especially when starting C Mitch Robinson got hurt).  I'll miss Quickley, not so much RJ, but I think this makes the Knicks a more well-rounded team.
I'm not completely sure how to feel about this trade as a raps fan. They needed to do something and I'm hyped that they did, but I don't feel like they really get much better or worse from this deal. IQ is a far better fit next to Scottie than Dennis is and I assume he'll become the new starter. RJ is a solid shooter and can help their often stagnated offense. But even with all that I still just feel like we're stuck in the middle. They're not gonna fall any further in the standings but likely won't climb a ton either. Either way, it's a step in the right direction
2024 pistons second rounder so pick 31-33.   NYK gets Precious A and M Flynn for C and PG depth.  PA can be a good defender and some Offense off bench.   Flynn is just 3rd emergency PG.
Trade paskal and quickley for zion!
I'm shocked the knicks didn't use their capital on a superstar
Knicks loss this trade wtf
How did the Raps turn down 3 firsts and end up with 2 jokes and a 2nd
I'm sorry, but you're take that this trade means the Knicks don't think they need another star or more offensive talent is off. Nothing about this trade signifies they are done on the trade market. They still have a lot of picks, a few team friendly contracts and a Fournier for salary matching. IQ was expiring and RJ is overpaid so they're not losing all that much imo
Toronto should try to get the whole Canadian Olympics team to play for them.
OG is too good of a fit for NY. You could come up with theory and all this better trade analysis, but some people are meant for specific team. And this is up there with how Brunson fits in NY despite all the “better” analysis that they should have gone for Mitchell, etc.
OG is so damn overrated. Why people talk about him as if he is on the level of a Jalen Brown. His offensive game is limited and he isn't a great 3point shooter. He is very athletic and a very good defender. But to max him out, hell naw. As a sixer fan I'm happy to not hear his name as a trade target anymore.
Didn't want to trade OG but that's a lot. New to the channel, good work.
I always thought OG was too arrogant for what his production often was.   Not even slightly upset he's gone.   And it's nice to get another Canadian on the squad, hopefully playing on his home court will motivate RJ to reach his full potential
This is an A+ move for the Knicks if you actually know the Knicks. #LetsGoKnicks.
Great analysis. Having followed OG you are getting probably a 1st (not 2nd) team defender, a great guy/team mate, clutch guy, no drama, but need to be mindful of his very extensive injury history and limited scoring upside. Happy for and grateful to OG.
Good trade, R.J. Beetlejuice Barrett is trash. Only goes left and is slow as a 🐌 on offense
Terrible trade for raps. And if this is what they offered for Mitchell no wonder they didn;t get him. This is A+ for NY and D for TO you are backwards.
At first glance this does not look good for the Knicks...but I'm glad they didnt send way more to Cleveland for a worse fit than OG. Also this leaves some room for another trade. Next season Quickley is probably gonna make 22/23 mil+26 for RJ and 2 mil for the 31st pick in the draft, a total of 50mil. OG's new deal is probably gonna start at 34/35 mil. The Knicks still have 3 first rounders from other teams, 5 of their own, Grimes on a cheap deal, and 19mil expiring of Fournier.
drake finna have rj onna track fs
Knicks get the best player in the trade and a B- grade? Ok
The Knicks are coming out way ahead here.  It's ridiculous to compare this to a Mitchell package.  Barrett is mid, and the reason they never traded him for Mitchell is because the Barrett package was laughed out of the room by their potential trade partners.  Both teams win because Anunoby was gone in Toronto, and Barrett might end up not being terrible, but it's probably only like 30% for him to be a positive asset on that contract.  He'll sell tickets in Canada too.  Raptors got an upside player for nothing, because they were missing playoffs this year anyways.  That's good, but Barrett is probably not going to work out imo.  He's clearly better than cap space over the next 3 seasons though, because his upside is like a secondary scorer on a playoff team.  They can develop him and potentially flip the last year of Anunoby's contract into an above average starter within 2 years.  Knicks are lucky to get a good player back for Barrett, Quickly is replaceable, he's just a scoring 6th man, those guys are dime a dozen.  They got a backup center until they get Robinson back.  They CLEARLY won the trade in the short term, and this trade working out for them is based around whether they become contenders and retain Anunoby.  Barrett was near worthless to them because he's bad now and their championship window will be closed by the time he hits his potential.  They were in a tough spot because they had to pay him that outrageous salary for 4 years when he's basically a project player on a team that has no championship window with their current roster.  Now the Knicks have a roster that can get lucky against Boston and Milwaukee, and assuming they can retain OG, they probably have a solid 3 or 4 years of free agency to sign vets and take shots at a title.  Win-win trade, but the Raptors are way more likely to fail, because the Knicks don't get worse by losing Barrett for nothing, and the Raptors are now committed to 4 years on a 2 guard that can't shoot.  At the end of the day, Barrett was near worthless to the Knicks for the next 2 or 3 years, so unless they were planning to ditch their core and rebuild around him, they are better off replacing him for nearly any rotation player, let alone one of the top 3 and D players in the league.  They have a much better roster now.
i would wayyyy rather have rj and quickly
Mitchell has become a low efficiency shot chucker who does a poor job of getting his teammates involved. He also is a cone on defense. This was the right move for the knicks. The only mistake I think the Knicks made is giving up Quigley. They should have found a way around that unless it was a deal breaker
They’re no longer in the Mitchell sweepstakes. He’s staying in Cleveland
Good luck signing Quickly as a restricted free agent
Rj sucks
Brunson Spyda OG Randle Robinson
Knicks still aren’t good enough to contend. Leon Rose is a dumbass
"Thats like the Donovan Mitchell package"  Like, no its not mate. Not even close.  This isn't the last move the Knicks make in the next 8 months.
Not only OG gets a max extension. Quickley is also on an expiring deal and will have to get paid the max to keep him in Toronto. I still think Toronto stays mediocre
This is not an A level trade bc of lack of draft capital. Still a good trade B- at the worst
The knicks still have 8 first round picks they can trade this year.......more then enough for a star player
Rj needed a change of location.
Brogdon to the Knicks?
Knicks trades look always bad. OG is not an all-star, it's just an all-defense second team.
Everyone is forgetting Immanuel Quickley is a free agent
As a knicks fan me and my dad where legit on the phone for an hour after the game talking about how everyone on the team is 6'3 and it isnt gonna work and IQ we love him but hes gonna walk. Then boom my thoughts come to life, hard to lose barret but i love the idea of sending him home! This fixes our size issue a bit now call Washington and figure out what Kuzma is gonna cost and get it done to fill the 6th man hole and give us more size that slots in 2 through 4!!!!!!
I’m so mad as a Knicks fan. Traded RJ and Quickley for OG and two guys who will ride our bench. Quickley is an elite sixth man and Barrett averages 20 a game. I get what we want is defense on the wing, but we could’ve gotten a better trade than Anunoby with those guys. Stupid trade
Masai actually traded a player before letting them leave for nothing in free agency. It’s a miracle
The Knicks gav3 up too damn much
The thing a lot of ppl are missing - The second round pick the raptors got in the deal is Detroit’s, so it’ll be the 31st pick and has basically the same value as a first from a contender
What picks? Knicks won this trade ; Barrett and quickly are trash neither can guard anyone.. those salaries will match OG who’s by far the better player. NY isn’t done yet they still have another move coming
7:04 ? 🤣🤣🤣 what in the world did he say
Lol the knicks lost this trade big time, Immanuel quickly is a better player right now then OG
Raptors got a younger b- guy with b+ potential in Rj, knicks get a b+ guy in anoby but gave up picks and a quality gaurd . I don’t see what the knicks are expecting from this and was a waste assets to fight for a 2nd round exit for the next 5 years. I guess being a playoff punching bag for real contenders is a step up in the right direction for the Knicks
This is a great trade for both teams. I love it
Only a second rounder is an absolute steal
Wasn't Achiuwa also included
This is a win-win. The Raptors needed to get something rather than losing OG for nothing at the end of the year, and the Knicks (after extending OG) have a nice team that are going to be a tough out.
This was the package we could’ve given the Cavs for Donovan Mitchell
RJ is booty, good that the Knicks got rid of him, but feel like they gave up a little too much for OG.
Nah Knicks is an A minus at worst.  They still have Grimes, Fournier’s Expiring and a Ton of firsts.  They weren’t going to match what another team could offer Quickley so you might as well get something instead of nothing.  C’mon Tuck quit that Chuck ish. 😂
People said these trade are close to what Danny Ainge did finessing the Cavs n wolves lol 😂   This a light trade nothing to go crazy about
the more see the knick more i think more how the mavs fucked upbecausei always thought the mavs in 2022 season extend brunson & upgreade there 3d wing for og;   i am going to see og with brunson this is fun
Disagree that it's the same trade as DMitch. Knicks offered RJ and IQ with 2 unprotected first round picks. Utah declined because they wanted to add 1 more unprotected pick plus Grimes or Obi and other draft swaps. This trade was straight RJ and IQ with No first rounders at all.
Toronto a$$ rapped the Knicks😂
Are they playing for tonight?!
“That was like the Donavan Mitchell trade package”   Uhhhh, no it wasn’t?? Maybe player wise, but Knicks were going to give up like three 1sts and they didn’t even give up one 1st in this. What are you even talking about
disagree with the deal being restrictive for NY; OG contract will be less than what it will cost NY to retain Quickley and keep RJs contract, will have contracts and depth to trade with alongside all 1st round picks. OG brings an elite skillset and pairs well with a Brunson Randle (+Don Mitchell presumably) trio, Raptors get an awesome player in Quickley who is incredibly underrated. Excited for both teams. What are we getting with Precious Achuiwa as a reserve minutes 4?
I don't think this is great for the Raptors. Because what they are doing is staying mediocre. Does anyone think Scottie Barnes and RJ Barrett are the recipe to a title team? Hell no. What is the point of selling your assets if you're not rebuilding from scratch? You wont get a title with these moves
As a raptors fan I’m hyppppeee
True winner might be the pistons, they play the raptors without og😂
As a Knicks guy I'm sad to see RJ go, always had high hopes for him.  The problem with RJ is that for an average shooter, physically/athletically he's just slower than you'd expect.  Offensively he can't seem to get around anyone and defensively he can't seem to stay in front of anyone. He has slow feet on both sides of the ball, and once you see it you'll never unsee it.  Overall still feels like the Knicks overpaid here, best of luck to RJ and IQ.
Looks like the raptors are going to start "trusting the process" if ya know what i mean. Lol
Quickly average 15 like OG
OG’s agent is Jalen Brunson agent AND he’s Leon Rose’s son!!!!!!! Stop talking like the Knicks are lost in the woods. 😂😂😂he’s a Knick for years to come.
Lol the draft compensation is 1 second… nowhere close to the D Mitch package
The problem with OG is that he is a good rotation player and probably the 4th best player on a really good team but he will want $40 million a year in the off season. He has an incomplete offensive game and sometimes you forget that he is even on the floor. He hasn't improved at all in the last three years. If anything, he has regressed this year. Good locker room guy.
As a Knicks fan it definitely concerns me about our bench scoring now and our backup point guard.  Like is Miles McBride gonna be getting 12 minutes a night now?  I know Fournier can score but Thibs will never trust him defensively.  I wish we could’ve gotten this done without giving up IQ but I get why Toronto would want hin specifically.
As a Knicks fan this is definitely a win. OG gives us better D and is a better fit with JB and Randle. Precious is the back-up to Randle we lost when we traded Obi away. Flynn can be a trade chip for a move further down. If OG pans out the money that was going towards RJ can be reallocated to signing OG. Hopefully the exit of IQ, will enable Grimes to get his act together as he has the talent, but hasn't been able to get it going.
Knicks want to get better but they got worse. Make it make sense, oh yeah it’s the Knicks
This really isnt like the Mitchell trade package. Its not picks plural. "Draft compensation" was 1 2nd round pick. They kept all their 1sts for possible future trades. Knicks upgraded at 3, get a backup C now that Mitch Rob is out, extra piece in Flynn, maybe to flip, more minutes for Grimes, get more space on the floor for Randle. I do like the trade for Toronto and am sad to see RJ & IQ go, but I do think overall is better for NY, but its a good trade for both.
A+ raptors, C- knicks
It's RJ, IQ & a 2024 2nd. Nowhere near the DM heist. NYK did good.
“I don’t love the trade for New York”. Dude Knicks got rid of a 125mill scrub who can’t make layups. And you have cap space and ALL YOUR PICKS for the summer. The iQ part hurts but with a rising cap you have enough clue what team overpays him as a RFA. It’s a good deal for both sides.
Does this make Poeltl more useful? Or is he a potential part of a package?
Good deal for New York, wish IQ coulda stayed tho.
Knicks got worked 😆
Odd trade in a way I’d assume neither side is done trading tho cause they barely changed the outlook for either team Siakam would be next I’d assume, Quickley the biggest winner of it all
Knicks should've found a way to keep Quickly; that's my only gripe with this. They have the right idea in terms of getting some size/talent, but Quickly is often a good scorer and spark off the bench.
The piston must be happy. Raptors will be shorthanded tomight
Wow, completely disagree with this dude. Great move for NY. They weren't gonna keep Quickley at the price he wanted, RJ never took a leap in 5 years of "development" and still paid him, and they kept all their 1st round picks. Had no legit wings like OG.
Knicks still need to get Brunson a serious second option to be taken seriously
my fellow knick fans absolutely do not see this as anything but a disaster. tbh I don't know the other 2 guys I only know OG.
Best Anunoby return they could have gotten though. Barrett will be such a nice piece for them to reconstruct around
masai bends the knicks front office over AGAIN! wooooo
as a long time Anunoby fan I have to say it sucks to see him go to a team like the Knicks 😂
OG isn't as good as Mitchell, but the reason why the Knicks didn't pull the trigger with a similar package is because JB and Mitchell would've been bad defensively.
NY fan here. IQ wasn’t gonna resign. RJ wasn’t clicking in NY even tho he did solid in the playoffs. OG is the player we needed. One of the best defenders on the wing who is a solid shooter. Now teams hopefully won’t smoke us lighting up the 3 as much. We also needed depth at the 4-5, and Achiuwa’s a rotation piece ig. Flynn’s okay, and we didn’t trade any first round picks. Yes, Toronto’s gonna love what they see once IQ and RJ play. But this is a win-win. Once Mitch Robinson is healthy this D is nasty next year (assuming OG resigns)
Don't know why the Raptors chose to trade OG first, he's a good young player that fits our team well. Should have traded Siakam first if we going full rebuild.
Iq want 25 mil a year that’s a lot for a 6th man but anyone who get him will be lucky
The 2nd is Detroit's pick so it will be the first one. Same place the Pacers landed Nembhard.......
RJ has been very inconsistent
As a Raptors fan, I think its about as good a deal you could have hoped for OG (I don't think it was crazy to turn down 3 firsts from Memphis when you know you're probably looking at mid-20s short of more Ja suspensions). You have two promising players that fit Scottie's timeline and basically a 1st round pick.  Hopefully RJ can fit better be a more consistent scorer with Barnes and Quickley playmaking for him but I like the upside here.
Great trade for both teams, I feel like the Knicks got what they needed and so did toronto.  I am a fan of both teams and I am super excited for the Knicks to make the playoffs, hopefully toronto turns their season around.
Uhhh the Knicks gave up way too much
This is a whacky deal for NY. Punting on Barrett & Quickley already for…OG on an expiring deal. Even if they resign him I still don’t think this moves the needle whatsoever
Knicks are kidding if they feel Brunson and Randle are 1/2 lol
NO WAY RJ is gonna be back at home!
Scottie, Barrett, and Quickley is not too bad. 👀
Knicks kept the first rounders so can see them still going for a star
I love og. But this is perfrct for both teams... barrett will be better for us. Quickley is a very real tyrese maxey type if given a real chance. I just hope we dont lose to much love for defence thats all. And barrett was never loved in new york. Og will be as a 3 and d guy... ill just miss flynn.... but im happy with this. And the 2 round pick... is the pistons.... itll be  the 1st pick in the 2nd round.... its a late 1st round pick lol.
I admit. This trade shocked me.   I am not sure how I feel about it.    I do know that the Knicks, if they wanted any chance to compete with Boston, Milwaukee and Philadelphia...had to make a move to get better. OG does that in a lot of ways. It clears up a log jam in the back court and makes the defense a lot better for thr Knicks.   For the Raptors, they get good value back. We will have to see what Barrett and Quickley become for them. I think with Scottie Barnes, it makes a very interesting new mix for the Raptors. If they decide they want to also keep Pascal Siakam as well, this could be a pretty wild looking team.   I think they will likely move Siakam as well because getting a couple of picks and some more depth could be the kind of thing that gives them long term stability as a team as they build the next roster.   I don't know what Barrett or Quickley will end up becoming for the Raptors. The potential is there for them to become really damn good.    However, I do advise some level of caution.  Plenty of trades have looked like this before. Where a team acquires some really good, high upside young talent. Then the youth doesn't find it's full potential with the increased role.   Granted they are both very talented young guys and I do think they will get better with a bigger role. This though for them is essentially sink or swim time. Take their game up to a new level, or end up being just a couple of good role players.
No Pascal trade... Pascal extension. That's why they pulled the trigger right at the deadline for an extension for Pascal.
Golden State could've pulled this trade off.
Awesome? More like boring and pointless. Two mediocre teams trade role players for absolutely no reason at all. This does nothing for either team and just wastes the potential OG could have had on any number of real competitive teams.
I can’t believe they made a trade considering the Knicks have a lawsuit with the raptors.
wow as knicks fan i hate this
Totally understand why the Raptors did this, but I'm very confused why the Knicks made this move. If OG leaves, they got swindled
Could’ve gotten Mitchell for what we gave up . Knicks are bad luck
I went to IU ... OG's special skill is his ability to guard 3s ans 2s ... the Knicks had to be looking at his defense as a major reason to make this trade ..
As much as I like OG that was too much for him.
I don't think Masai Ujiri got all he could out of this trade. I mean sure he gets RJ Barrett who is under contract, Quickley who is an upgrade at the one, but not even a first round pick? Not to mention the questionable fit with Barrett being a worse shooter. Knicks win this trade by far.
Pistons are winning tonight
Masai doing Masai things
really good trade imo for both teams. quickley get to finally be a starter, rj get to play for his home country. knicks didn't gave up a lot, and oh boy, thibs is gonna looooove OG i can tell you. get ready to play 40 mins a night, just like in the nick nurse era lol
Dude you are brain dead if you think this is the equivalent of what Utah wanted for Donovan. Apparently you think a single 2nd round pick is about the same value as three 1st round picks.
Maybe I’m wrong but how does it help the Knicks? Their struggles on offense come from the fact no one outside of Brunson can create for others and create for himself now you have to depend on him even more and inconsistent Randle. You add OG he helps the defense but he’s another guy that stands around the corner or 3pt line he can’t shot create. Come playoffs when Brunson is getting clamped are we betting on OG to put the ball on the floor and get a bucket or make a play for himself???
What the Knicks really need is Mikal Bridges and Kyle Lowry. #Wildcats
From 3 first rounders to a single second round pick. Might just be me who dont understands this trade
You talked alot about OGs extension but didn't say anything about IQs. Sure we need to pay OG now but we would've needed to pay IQ anyway so it's kinda irrelevant
both teams got better with this
NYK can bundle Randle's contract with multiple picks & swaps (and other guys) to get a max guy.
Tucker says its a lot for OG but in other videos have said “trade 3 first round picks for OG”
"We have a very rare happening in the NBA here today" Me: The Raptors made a significant trade
Sad to see OG leave, but happy that he'll be hyped up by S.A. Smith
Raps win this trade fs. Got better value back and can now either decide to sell other guys and rebuild or buy into a bigger name for the playoffs
This is no where near the Mitchell package because that would have included a bunch of first round picks
I would have preferred 4 FRPs if I was the raptors, but this is not bad either.
This is not a great trade for the Knicks cuz they r gonna have to pay him a ton of money
I remember Knicks fans trying to argue with me that “RJ Barrett is just as good if not better than Ant” 😂😂😂 I also remember at the beginning of the year they had fans making mock trades for Kat that were less than what they just traded away for OG, and now I’ll probably see arguments that OG is better than KAT. They are an absolutely delusional fan base! 😂
It's win-win. They get to try out a prototypical 3&D wing to see how it works. Next season, Fournier's money allows them to afford him and if he walks, they have max contract money. Quickley is going to be too expensive unfortunately and want a starting spot that he won't get. Also lowkey Achiuwa is very neccesary rn given their need for playable bigs. Next season Hartenstein is a free agent that might go for 8 figures considering the Knick have already been paying him 9 million. Achiuwa is an RFA so they have optionality there.
Mitchell? c'mon that included 3 1sts and some pic swaps. not the same vicinity
Siakam will sign an extension.
Solid trade for both teams! IQ was leaving the Knicks regardless and they didn't have to give up any first round picks for once. The Raptors get a potential Canada born star in RJ and IQ who will probably score 20 points a game..
Can OG really replace Barretts's points? And who's going to replace IQ's points in the 2nd unit? The Knicks just got tougher and better defensively but lost scoring, especially off the bench. I wonder if the Knicks have another deal cooking?
let's go!!!!!.....wait we gave up what. 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬
The issue for the knicks is quickly was due for an extensive that could have been used to match salaries with a star. The only saving grace is randle and Brunson are on great contacts.
A second round pick, iq and a overpaid inefficient player makes this similar to the Donovan Mitchell trade package. How?
I was watching the Celtics raptors game last night and thought OG would be a great trade target. Idk i though, I think Barrett and IQ are a bit too much to give up but then again, Barrett is really inconsistent.
Glad to see the Raptors add another Canadian. RJ is a talent
Can't they pair their pick now with founier
Knicks really won go get d Murray now
I'm a raptors fan and I love this trade. Maybe RJ playing for his hometown team could be what he needs to take a leap
Bro they might lose to the pistons without OG 💀
I just know that RJ is going to blow up
So I assume this means that Siakam is probably getting traded too.
Oh great we could of really used OG in Detroit
I usually like your videos but you’re absolutely wrong about this trade being like the Mitchell trade. They wanted 4 1st rd picks and all of our young guys. Knicks got rid of a player they weren’t going to resign and a player they regret resigning for a coveted wing and a perfect backup PF for Randal. This video could’ve been better if you would’ve taken your time and done the research
I like this trade. Also for New York.
Don't forget Precious Achiuwa is going to NY too
I don’t like Rj barrett with Scottie Barnes. Bt in a fan of Quickley for sure
It’s probably just one pick (Detroit’s 2nd round). That’s not the same package they offered for Mitchell
we were going to loose OG anyway in free agency.  better to get something
Bro they got a 2nd round pick; man said some “  picks “ like cmon bro.
I think this will make the Knicks relatively “better” in the immediate future but will it be enough to win a chip? It’d be surprising but I like this trade a lot for the Raptors as well cause getting RJ and Quickly for the future rebuild is about as great of return for OG they could’ve got.
I hope OG Anunoby does well with the Knicks.
Great trade for Toronto
This was a great trade for the Knicks honestly. Barrett’s contract is too expensive for how little he’s improved (turning into a contract dump candidate) and Quickley is about to get paid. The Knicks also got Achiuwa who can be a front court rotation player while only giving up a second round pick. Worst thing that happens for NY is OG leaves and creates cap space while the best outcome is Anunoby being a great complimentary piece and signing a long term deal this summer. Definitely a win for the Knicks
Can’t wait to force OG off the team because from what I’m seeing, this dude is not good. Seems like it’s the same case for RJ. No style no flash no moves no anything except the bare minimum you’d expect out of a basic NPC player. But to lose quickley for this shit. That’s sad.
The raptors just pulled a sam presti type deal  They gon end up with the best player in the trade +barrett and a pick😭😭😭
Knicks needed a back up Center and OG was as good as a move you can get while covering your missing positions filling it with Precious Achiuwa and Flynn
Lol OG is a black hole on offense outside of corner spot up 3. Dude just falls and loses the ball like he's a deer slipping on ice.
This means Knicks need shooting guard and will go after Donovan Mitchell !!!
Knicks gave up RJ Barrett; one of the most inefficient players in the league who was a net negative on both sides of the ball with one of the worst true shooting percentages in exchange for a player who’s a better defensive player, better shooter, just an overall net positive player for their team and they didn’t even need to give up a first round pick for him yet the Knicks got fleeced? The Knicks could’ve gave up Fournier only for OG for people would’ve still said they got fleeced. They won this trade.
Ngl if it was j barret picks and a different guy then quickly this would b a huge w. But givijg up quickly was an awful decision
Its a risky move for certain. At the end of the day , OG can just sign with another team if he really wants to. While I also understand that you had to do something with IQ as even with Fournier being most probably gone after this season , signing IQ would have nearly eaten up all the cap space and they would not be better. RJ has the capacity to be a near all star level player , but has the consistency of a G league roster. So in terms of the trade , the Knicks gave up an incosistent player , a second rounder in a probably weak draft , and a good player. The Knicks are trying to become a good team without a huge star for once , trying to become a team that other players want to join and not trade for them. I can appreciate this attempt. It will most probably not work , but hey , they are trying at least :)
Holy shit, happy with this trade. Sad to see OG go, but it was time
The Mitchell package Danny Ainge wanted was 2 of Obi, Grimes, Quickley, and multiple 1sts.  AND they had zero interest in RJ outside of salary
OG didnt go to Philly... OG didnt go to Miami... Boston rejoices
Damn, Masai is a fleecer. They got to young pieces for a player that was probably leaving anyway...
For the Knicks, they offload RJs bad contract and get a player back they can sign who they need desperately without losing IQ for nothing.  Mitchell was an additional 3-4 1st round unprotected picks lol
as a knicks fan i really dont want to get rid of quickley. i mean for a little while ive thought he was a 6th man of the year candidate in the near future so to get rid of him, i hate it
As a Raptors guy, I couldn’t understand the overhype on OG. He’s a great 3-D guy, but he can’t create and runs like he’s wearing two left shoes
Tbf, both Utah and Cleveland demanded a lot more for Mitchell than this. Especially in terms of draft capital.
Good trade for Raps...not sure what Knicks see moving forward...still missing a pc
The NYK need to be placed under involuntary conservatorship. They need an adult should to sign off on trades so the rest of the league will stop taking advantage of them.
OG is awful when he puts the ball on the floor
You missed one point here. IQs contract was expiring and he wanted $22 million + more minutes. Knicks weren’t willing to offer him Brunson money to come off the bench. They either lose him in free agency or get an awesome 3&D guy - simple
Love this deal as a Raps fan - OG is one of the most overvalued guy in this league and thankful I won’t have to see Flynn play again
so what the hell are NY doing?
This deal works for both teams, but sadly I still see New York as a 2nd round exit.
IQ is gonna be a star
Am happy Barrett is gone hes garbage
Finally masai makes a move that actually makes sense. I hopenits just the beginning because i believe siakam should be moved as well
I’m really gonna miss him as a raps fan but we werent gonna afford both him and siakam😢
Some people arent happy with trade I'm cool with it.
Haven’t watched your videos for a couple months and I don’t back to see NO BEARD?! What have I missed
In Masai We Trust
If OG doesn’t resign this upcoming off season, worst trade in Knicks history considering they gave up quickley
Let's wait and see first
Raptors are fleecing
First
