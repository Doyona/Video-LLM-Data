Is this the "He's gassin' him out" guy?
Bruh DC be killing his chair😭😭
This trio is gold 😂 . They should have a podcast
I'm surprised there are people defending Cruz here if you were in DCs place you would get pissed off your co-worker is talking shit to millions of people to see.
The air changed when Bisping entered for the better.
3 good friends
Dude cruz has no right to talk after the commentary on the conner and khabib fight lmao are you fucking kidding me bro , straight delusional
Stay away from people that think their never wrong
God i love bisping
DC you’re my guy. Respect
DC was roght
Dom is basically just filibustering because he knows hes wrong and hates admitting it.
Bispings the best
front seat always dominic
It’s gotta be so hard to be friends with dom…. Also worst commentator always very biased (ex: poirier v gaethje 1 )
Accountability is love. Nobody who doesn’t care about you will hold you accountable, they don’t care
We love dc for who he is need some of that real fighter excitement
Man DCs chair is really suffering
Dom’s that friend you hate sometimes but you respect the fact that you always know where you stand with him.
DC & Dominick Cruz are great 👍🏽!
DOMINICK IS NOT DRY LOL! HE'S WET! :)
DC AND DOMINICK LOVE EACH OTHER LOL! :)
Cruz argues like a wife. 'I am not alllowed to tell my feelings???'
You can tells doms a good guy under that analyst surface
Dc is entertaining when I hear him with Joe Rohan Dominic Cruz is different I get educated on the fighting and wrestling when he talks I like that to.
This shit never gets old
Cruz acting like a woke karen
These guys truly are family OMG !!!
I love this lol...its brother's lovin'on each other, and DC ur abit defensive bro! 😂😂
F... Dominick
"Conor is making khabib tired by taking punches in the face"- Dominic Cruz   Brother DC you SHOULD HAVE said this when he asked you to critique his commentary 🤣🤣🤣
This is why this is the greatest sport in the world 🌍
Sounds like a bad n.a. meeting  Accountability isn't love  Love is patient..kind n doesn't boast
I love how this interview went from 0 to 100 in literally 5 seconds…and I’m here for it all the way😂
Y’all need to stop crying, y’all taking this more seriously than they are. They both different people, they both have a point. This is honestly just a friendly argument, not no breaking a stupid code and stuff.
Lmao who's here after dom got KOd by Chito while bisping and DC commentated? KARMA LOL 🤣
Cruz is so good in analyzing and we can see it when he said that Conor was getting beaten in round 1-2-3 by Khabib to  gas him out.
Cruz knows he was wrong, that's Cruz only real fault here is being able to say he's sorry.
BEEF 🥩
Comedy gold!
Watching this and seeing him hang out with Lloyd Irvin tells you everything.
Dom was right on his comments of DC DC was right about saying this in private.  At the end of the day, Dom revealed the lack of respect between them two and DC revealed that he just doesn’t put as much effort to get paid.   You can put more credibility into what Dom says in his analysis but we now know DC is willing to pay others to do his homework.   However, don’t trust DC with his homework and his insights, and don’t trust Dom with private conversations because he’ll put it on blast publicly.
Dom, You don't make your kid accountable infront of people, it may hurt him or he might come as rebellious just to prove his ego..   You could tell DC about his shortcomings in private so that DC can work on it.. You just humiliated your colleague to make yourself look good..  But we know everyone is biased and You DOM too.. You said conor was tiring khabib out by getting punched where we all knew Conor had no option but eating those punches.. Khabib was superior in that..  You are sh!t too Dom.. So don't point finger when you are doing the same..
DC I love your channel!
DC and rogan together is what I like to call Def commentary jam
Doms just lucky dc doesnt flip him up side down on his head
little man syndrome personified. i don't wanna hear "he could beat your ass" cause i'm not the double champ twice his size thats sitting in front of him that he's mad at.
dc should have said "remember when you said conor was making khabib tired by absorbing 30 punches to his face?"
Typical asshole guy in the workplace, always try to undercut you or put you down. Extremely unprofessional by Cruz. What a bum, DC is too nice.
They need more of this, very entertaining
Professionally, Cruz is wrong. He could’ve said it personally
1 minute in and it’s no longer an interview
Dom ! Yes you are wrong cuz you should say this shit in front of DC instead of saying it for some fans !
Dc better that Dc
They need to get married
I'm with DC.
Not everyone would be as nice as DC being as powerful as he is. Such a sweetheart he is.
there should be a true facts about dc
just sitting here watching their fingers
I love these guys. They're the real ones
Dom needs to analyze because at times he lacks common sense. Like when Connor was "tiring out Khabib" by letting Khabib punch him on the face. Like them both and no one is perfect but I agree with DC. Dom "accountability is love" unless you hold him accountable. Then its Dominick Cruz mental gymnastics time. Also using feelings to describe something like its objective is a douche move. What makes them click is they compliment each other. I wouldnt watch 2 cormiers or 2 cruzs together and definitely not 2 bispings.
"I dont bother to combat it, so then you take it as fact" Wow this is so relevant to me. People think because you  dont feel the need to defend yourself from their dumb accusations, that they're right.
These dudes are literally just having an argument
Dom ought to be glad this was DC and he took this well.  You want somebody to improve? You talk to them and help them realise what you think is a shortcoming.  You want beef? Go out in public and talk trash about them.
Really dont like Cruz
How dare bisping says cruz is the best. Im a khabob fanboy and still cant get over what he said about the conor fight 5 years ago
Cruz is that person that thinks everything he says is right and everyone else is wrong
I'm with DC here. C'mon, Cruz still believes McGregor was trying to tire out Khabib by getting smashed in the face lol
Loved this haha
Michael “I’m having a laugh” Bisping. The man is next level amusement. Love it.
Dominick Cruz has a problem with everyone first the guy from monster and now DC, he needs to become a good fighter that is what's up.
I love that. “I don’t need you to make it better” that’s why I love Cruz
Three of my all time favorite fighters. Dom was my first favorite fighter. Way back to the first Uriah Faber fight. When he tapped there was a fire there that comes through still to this day but back then it showed me that he had that true fighting spirit. From that fight he went on a tear. Love that guy as a fighter.
The thing that makes Dominic Cruz a great fighter also makes him a shitty friend and commentator. Nobody cares how much film you watch if your commentary is boring like Dominic Cruz. Having a researcher is actually pretty common on sports shows as well. Cruz is jealous of DC and he's also a pretty boring commentator. He even took a few more shots at the end. What a turd!
Daniel, you need to be muted once in a while... constant rambling doesn't work my man
Dry + Funny = The Dominator Masterclass
3:00 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Vintage Dominick 🤣
DC is definitely right
He is now Dominick "The Karen" Cruz🤣🤣🤣
Bruh. The amount of pure skill between those three and 2 of the fucking most savage shit talkers in mma… this is perfection.
watch dom on so many commentating jobs ahahaha especially conor vs khabib
The greatest light heavyweight and heavyweight on this planet and the greatest wrestler in the world and of all time he would rag doll Jason burrows King cormier
It's impressive how hard Dominick is projecting here.
I’m thinking the whole time watching this, “Dominick must be a Virgo”.  Looked his birthday up, and sure enough. Virgos are relentless and harsh when they “know” they’re right.
Never in a million years I would've thought Mike was such a cool funny guy after seeing in firsts appearances. He was young and arrogant, now I love to see his shit on social media.
Michael took me out 💀
DC is a good friend and Cruz is a bad one. Don’t tell Cruz anything personal or it might come out. DC will never say anything.
Cruz's brain went out cruzing and left his head with air. Lol. This uy is soool stupid Cruz is. I don't know why DC wasted his time
If Bisping is stylish for 40 then what am I at almost 30 when we wear the same shit 😅
We fucking love you DC!
Who would like to have Dom as a colleague?
Dom refused to tell DC what exactly he got wrong in the commenting, and instead had DC prove he knows his shit so that he could then pick on little details. Dom is being disingenuous and comes off a unrelatable
Cruz clearly doesn’t know about Detail with DC
Dominic is such a punk. Should’ve said something to DC straight up and not gossip to the media. He then tried to even score by making DC criticize him but DC isn’t slimy like that.
Dom was DC‘s guy for preparing and watching fights you can tell. The way to Max when they talk about DC admitting that he had someone watching them for him is written in stone baby. DC needs to talk to Kevin Lee and get on some Adderall. I it was funny at the end he said he couldn’t do this anymore, as him being an ex competitor him saying that and submitting it was kind of funny. He didn’t have a way to win the argument so he said screw you guys I’m going home in his Cartman voice
Emhmmm DC ain't no Olympic gold medalist. Hehe
Check out the new short if you will.
Yoooo
Dom really got that high school bully energy 🤦‍♂️
Cruz is a POS for this one. This has wrongly portrayed a person that loves what he does. This is directly attacking a friends livelihood. Many people after that directly or indirectly now negatively question dc’s love for the sport as well as subject knowledge. It could have effected his kids having food on the table with no prior thought or any fact. In the streets he’d be getting jumped
Cruz came ready for an argument 😂😂
Dominick thinks he is so much smarter than he is
Idk why but as soon as bisping entered I just started laughing lol
That’s cool that oak grove still sponsors you remember seeing that on your shorts
Dc do some research fkn hate your commentary
DC is the John Madden of MMA
Dom: you dont have enough patience DC DC: oh man i cant do this anymore
Staged! Genius!
This should be a podcast I love they're energy towards each other
These guys just fighting over initials...
Dominick Cruz smells like alcohol and cigarettes 🚬
Three completely different personalities getting along       (well, sort of)
Cruz is spot on. DC disrespects the fighters the way he does commentary. Do some research and give the fighters the respect they deserve man. Jack Slack explains this whole thing so good there´s no need for me to explain it here. Check out Jack Slack´s few latest episodes of his podcasts. Dominic Cruz keeping it real bless
I find it funny that Cruz dont understand, its not what opinion he has, but who he tells it to :)
I wonder how good Cruz prepared for the commentary of Kabib vs Connor. I mean really :)
The fact that DC got Dom to laugh fucken hard is everything, we need more🙏
Shouts to Bisping.  …that fake hug from Dom at the end was it. Hopefully DC doesn’t invest any more energy into the relationship.
sexual tension so thick you could cut it with a knife.
at the end of this DC should have ragdolled cruz around for about 5 minutes just to let him know.
Cruz seems extremely passive aggressive. If they were actually friends before and not just colleagues he's a shitty friend!
I just want to know why Cruz thought it would be a good idea to say it on national television/the internet?  It's truly strange. By the way, didn't he try to pretend he was a psychologist against Adesanya?
cruz is the most boring commentary person to listen to by far.. he never laughs .. and he tries talking about his own fights like half the time.. DC's commentary is probably the best ..its what id imagine watching the fights with him at a bar would be like.
Well played DC. Also...you are absolutely right to call this out. Dominic is a smart dude but my god is he arrogant. He knows that was a shitty thing to do. Can't believe you guys let him pull the 'blame the media' card. That's like saying 'my friend is a murderer. But I love him' and blaming the media for focusing on the murder part and not the love part. Fuck off man :)
you brown nosing son of a bitch Bisping 🤣🤣🤣 this is some of the greatest footage ever
I’ve been waiting for this, great content
I’m beyond shocked dom is this ignorant,  to say that stuff publicly and defend it that it’s ok is embarrassing to man code
Best part about Dom is hes always pissed about somthing
yeah this was a laugh dear lord mick, dc and dom in one room dam.
DC, and Rogan too, pull for who the UFC wants to win far worse than what I see hometown broadcasters pull for the team that they cover. It's like Fox news and CNN, straight garbage commentary
I mean seriously when Dom was saying what did I say wrong? He was acting like a teenager, man I saw this same scenario so many times in my life, I feel sad that a guy over 30 is acting like that.
Yes Dom that was wrong of you, I know you are stubborn and you can't admit that you are wrong.. DC was saying facts and you can't even say Im sorry or that was bad if me.. You need to man up
He is such a narcissist he doesn't get the point if your teammate had a hurt leg you wouldn't go to the press conference before the fight and say hey my teammate has an injured right leg
“I’ll pick you up you little bastard and throw you through the window!” 😂😂
This is pure quality, I’ve watched it a few times now 😂😂
IMO both guys have big highs and major lows when it comes to commentary and their own niche. Both of them are also complemented well by certain specific guys on the desk but best kept away from others.   What really sticks out to me with Dom is the fact that he insists on calling himself an "analyst" even when he's acting/speaking in his commentary role. And frankly, that plays into how dry and technical he is on commentary; Cruz at times just goes to show that being a good analyst doesn't inherently mean being a good commentator for the masses.
Hes dry, he literally called himself sodium.
Dom is wayyyyyy off. Saying holding someone accountable is way different to saying something that could lose another colleague credibility to some fans and casuals of the sport. Its not cool what he said and he just seemed super dismissive and arrogant. His character doesn't have much integrity and the way he talks about others publicly is blunt and rude. He tries to shame and embarrass people in an unfunny and self absorbed way. Just makes his air time unbearable to watch.
I'm on Cruz' side. DC's still bitter as hell, lol.
Dominic cruz has to understand that DC has kids to feed and saying shit like that wants DC to get fired
The problem with Dom’s assessment is the impact his words have in a public forum. In other words, a character assassination by saying in his words: “…get the job done, make his money…”. That’s a very big assumption from which he appears to have little evidence for. Discredits his argument in my opinion.   It’s clear that Dom has no intention of being a team player. Once you break trust in any business, it’s very hard to recover.
ahahahaha this is hilarious
But we can never forget Dominique Cruz commentating mcgregor vs khabib.. so biased.
Dominick Cruz is dry as Switzerland salami
That was way to entertaining
I think Dom knowing DC for many years of having good sense of humor didn't expect to get offended by his honest comment.  But he also said good things about DC to the reporter that where not publish.
PEOPLE NEED TO LEAVE CORMIER THE FUCK ALONE.
Seems like Your to Lazy to Cruz. But Cruz is a Fucken Maniac Tom Cruise kind of Guy. Im sure Dominick is not Marry!
Maybe when Dom retires he can finally relax and let go of things. Look at Bisping, he used to be a complete ass and now he's a totally different guy.
Dom's a great fighter but a jerk off personality and I've been watching him since WEC days. He doesn't seem to get the entertainment aspect of the sport. I almost think he has personal demons on his fighting career and how injuries kept him from being the best in the world. DC is out there building the youth up with wrestling, he simply doesn't have the time to be as anal in watching videos as Cruz.
I like cruz but hes a bit of a narzissist in some ways, shouldnt have said what you did man lol just wrap your head around head cruziboi
Dom was in the wrong and is intelligently stupid.
"Put me in the middle East, I will solve all the problems" - Michael Bisping
It's like watching The Rock talking to Edward Norton.🤣
I enjoy listening to DC...very entertaining and knows what he talking about..especially when it's DC,Joe and Jon anik together ...they mix very well  together
It would be nice if DC knew who the fighters were or at least could pronounce their names. Let's start there, then we'll focus on maybe talking about the fight in front of him.
Dominick cruz is such a bad commentator that it’s funny that this guy is critiquing Daniel.   He may watch fights and have knowledge but he always says the dumbest shit.
I wonder what happened to Dom growing up that has given this permanent chip on his shoulder. It’s like he is always looking for a reason to pick a fight with even his friends.
If only there were more UFC videos like this
lmaoo
That's just who Dom is... he doesn't understand or believe in the fact that he can have opinions in his mind if he can't say it face to face and publicly, because that wouldn't be genuine or real to him  I think that's just the mindset he is at right now, probably because he built around that mindset for fighting as well, he keeps it real to himself and everyone, or atleast whatever he perceives to be real  I think when he retires and get's older he will have a completely different outlook or atleast an understanding what DC is trying to say  He genuine loves DC
I have to side on DC here just out of my on experience at work. When I have a disagreement with someone and I feel the need to put them in check, whether he's a friend or not, I always given the courtesy to adress the issue privately.  Now I understand Cruz was put on the spot by being asked the question in public and maybe if being candid is one of his values, then I can understand why he aas forced to answer that question.
DC stay you bro, I rather have analyst that talk like friends talking about a sport they love them some nerd. That’s why Inside The NBA is the highest rated show. Let him be snobby you can get the accolades 😂
You don’t think you’re dry, I just about died lol 😂
I like Cruz but that was low. Khabib or the Dagastanian lads wouldn't of done that
even when things are true, you dont have to publicly address something that will tarnish the reputation of a colleague / friend. it's a real dick move. If i were DC i wouldnt have reacted as he would have. DC seems like a real nice guy.
This is Fantastic! This is the best UFC video I've ever watched!
these guys need to fight more
DC is right. I think Dom knows this. Dom speaks alot without thinking about it, then he has to defend his stance
Dom isn't making any sense ...
This is NOT a friend DC, this guy doesn't respect you and is now using all the gaslight he can to get himself out,  this is a snake in the grass ...
This was awesome! Dominic is bringing the new age vibrations to the forefront. Love to see it! P.S I'm hitting the sub!
DC is right, it’s not the comment it’s the way he said it publicly. Rat behavior
Why the Fuck is Dominic Cruz being so confrontational and aggressive on here? I don't like that
If im Dana. I'll keep DC to call the big fights, And Dom for fight night. Just to seprate them. And i think DC,s call during fight is fantastic just because of his fight IQs and experience. But to compare statically between Dan or Dom at the table, I'd put all in on Daniel Cormier.
Dominic us hella stubborn 😣
I love Cruz, but he’s wrong here. No ones a perfect commentator. Cruz said mcgregor was trying to gas out Khabib by laying on the floor and getting smashed. Everyone says stupid shit, no exception. To throw him under the bus in public is a shitty move. DC wouldn’t of done the same vice versa. Also DC is a color commentator he’s not there for in depth analytics.
It was an asshole move by Dom. Daniel you’re a better man than most of us.
I'd bet anything Dominick feet don't touch the ground
This should be a weekly thing 😂
It’s unbelievable that Dom can’t admit that making this public was wrong.
I love you DC  I love this trio
DC is right, an advice in public is a humiliation. Bad move Dominic.
Don is arrogant! AND he's dry. So much so, that ive called him Dominick Snuze for a long time
DC is a corporate commentator with a bias opinion that boss tell him, to put over a fighter, even if he/she clearly lose.On the other end Dominic never lied or was putting over any fighter corporation wants to win. DC didnt lean on the towel as well.
Uncle DC, why uncle bisping got more viewer than ur video? 😁
Drama brings money 😁
Dom is good with words. I think that's why his always talking so much. Just gotta find someone to beat him at his own game haha
That was left unresolved. Dom can hold colleagues accountable, but just not in the public eye 🤷‍♂️ I think that makes sense and I’m not sure why he is struggling to see that.
Idk how you can even be a fan of Dominick Cruz after this Interview he is the definition of a narcissist
"Sodium sounds SO GOOD right now..." Licks lips with his literally dry mouth as the water jug just sits there... 😂😂😂 The weight cut struggle real af
Watching the start of this stoned was so confusing haha
DC is embarrassing 🤣🤣🤣
I must say, i really like Dominics Direct honesty, he is a cool dude.
DC with DC
Ohh
Alright this was amazing to watch. I really hope we can hear these 3 along with Rogan, Felder  and anik as long as the UFC is around.
I feel like Dom is in the right. He was talking as a fighter not Dc’s analyst friend. Doms a fighter this past week not on the commentating or analyst team.
Look, it took a lot of restraint to not just bring up the khabib Conor dispute to prove a point
What there doing is brilliant, its not just mma media its and msm, there dividing our country its a disease....fkn brilliant gentlemen, fkn come together get over each other bias, its all love..no hippie
DC, the level of understanding that you expect from Cruz - bring that to your own commentary and analysis. It is hypocrisy when you don't.
Dc talks to much sometimes
Dominique Cruz is a narcissist. Possibly a sociopath
Bisping is intimidating asf
Cruz is that type of manager at work that tells you your one of his favorite employees but trashes you and tries to get you fired behind your back.
Fighters non stop are so sensitive for such hard tough people they take punches and elbows all day but words flaw them over and over again.
“Bisping is that drunk friend we all have”  -this message was brought to you by…  -Your local functioning alcoholic
I can't stand DC's commentating. I'm sure he's a good person but just can't stand the shit he says! To be fair when he specifically talks about wrestling positions and what a fighter should do its good. But then he just goes on...and on....and oooooon! I mean they could be in the middle of a scramble and DC's yapping with Bisping about how some side story BS.  These guys in my opinion should go listen to old time boxing broadcast. Describe the action thats it. In between rounds discuss fighter meeting info or maybe a quick note side story. They all do it but DC drives me nuts with it!!
9:00 Dom 🤣🤣🤣 Funny as shit man. 3 Stubborn ass dudes all disagreeing but having fun with it. Fuckin love it
Great video and thanks for being REAL I just subscribed 😎
Can Cruz stop being a commentator.  Omigod he ‘s a great fighter but his personally is actually exhausting
Well that was a bit different 😂
DC does not need to do research to call a fight. As a fan I like his breakdown of what he sees. Dom Cruz is a fucking weasel. He just dropped stock in my eyes.
dominick cruz is a clown
I love this
Look at it like being at a bar with friends.  If everyone’s anchored like anik and Dom it’s not a fun night.  You need the DCs of this world to hype shit up.  If anything rogan is the worst of all but even he adds something.
DC just has a common man type of commentating and i enjoy it
Cruz is such an annoying person in general
Cruz is such a fuckin clown   Of the 2, which commentator will forever be known for one of the dumbest comments in a fight ever?   "CONOR IS TRYING TO GAS KHABIB OUT."  That's not good commentary or good analysis.
Love y'all
Or is it knee to I need a new job
Hey y'all are in that between of Michael who holds a middle weight of a great ... He need Ross into a stunt man in an episode of sorry Friend
DAAAAMMNNN
dom shouldn't criticize any commentating after the khabib connor fight "why isn't he trying to get up (with the best P4P wrestler in MMA history on him) & he's trying gas khabib out (when getting smashed on the ground)
Write a comic book
Cruz and DC you make Jones and Cody look like fucking Super Heros .... There's my negative feed ... lol
WEC made me a fan before the UF soaked it up
Had those injuries not happened....Dom would have beat the breaks off Diesel like he was racing on Fast and Furious
Can't call a person like that your friend or brother. Cruz threw DC under the bus and shows no remorse about it. If Cruz really saw him as a friend then he should have spoken to him in private about it.
gold
This guy has a big ego, publicly criticising a colleague that disgusting.  Dont forget what this great commentator said  Dom: Connor is trying to gas Khabib out Joe rogan: I dont think so I think hes getting smashed
You literally dry things with sodium! 🤣🤣🤣 Dominick "Sodium"  Cruz
it's pretty obvious Cruz is jealous of the success of DC as a commentator and ufc personality.  DC showed a lot of class and you can tell Cruz was getting defensive because he knows what he was doing when he said those things.  i hope DC prospers even more after this.
Man I fucking hate how easy the word “friend” gets thrown around. Dom Cruz isn’t friends with DC. “And who made that rule” tells you all you need to know 🐍
Weasel move by Cruz.  DC doesnt need to study fights all the time to call fights.  He's fought his whole life including a long wrestling career.  He knows exactly what he's talking about in all exchanges that go on in the cage.
"Put me in the middle east I will solve all the problems "Michael The Count Bisping
Dom has been acting like a bit of diva since he got k.od by henry cejudo and started protesting an actual justifiable ref call .and know he  trashes dc  who actually has reL fighting knowledge. wow
Cruz needs to go re watch him call the connor khabib fight with all this bozo shit lol. Cruz "Conor is doing good just tiring him out and taking no damage here"  J rogan- " no I think he's just getting his face smashed in" Cruz " why isn't he trying to get up????" Rogan "cuz hes exhausted from getting his face smashed in" Bruh Cruz is horrible and just straight up wrong for dragging this into the media. Idc about whatever weaknesses someone could try to say about dc. His strengths should blind anyone to them because of how strong they truly are.
Dom doesn't seem ok mentally. I'm feeling like the damage from fighting is starting to show in his behavior. With that said, the banter between the 3 of them was hilarious.
Dom Cruz said that McGregor was trying to ware out Khabib by getting ground and pounded... HOW IS HE THE BEST X's AND O's COMMENTATOR?!  He also needs to know there's Commentary and colour commentary... every single NBA team has both... bc you need both
Even if Cruz is correct, his unwillingness to listen and not interrupt is off-putting and makes him look seem like a dick.
"i'm dry?..... i add so much soduim" 😂😂😂😂😂 dominick is a real serial killer.
Dominic is acting like a bitter angry little girl
Best podcast ever in the making!
Cruz musta just cut weight out here talking bout sodium
Dom must not have had great friends growing up. Or he’s got aspergers and doesn’t realize why it feels like a betrayal to call a friend out publicly instead of telling them privately.
Dom us a dork
Heightened intelligence usually results in decreased empathy. Time spent studying means time was cut from social interaction. In his head Dom is entirely justified and you can't really fault him.
DC he tried to drag you to his school yard behaviour. You should have just let the baby be.
Can y’all do more like this please 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dominic is wrong for saying that about DC publicly. He should of done it behind closed doors. Media can twist words and make such a big deal out of nothing. You don't criticize your friend publicly Especially cuz they're friends and coworkers.
DC is right here. Dominic shouldn't have said that to the media.
Cruz the Bullshit guy: saying “conner is gassing khabib out” this diring the fight while mctapper is getting smashed😂😂😂
Cruz is a snake in the grass.
Dom: The way DC calls fights is wrong. DC: what do I say is wrong Dom: Nothing, I don’t listen to it because I mute it.  Wtf
To be honest, dominik did him dirty. He should ve spoke to him privately about his inadequacies.
Dom is real.
Dominick Cruz was WRONG to tell the media that he mutes DC's commentary. He was also wrong to say that DC only does it for a cheque. If the UFC fires Dominick Cruz I wont loose sleep. Unprofessional.
Bitch move by Dom, props to DC for keepin cool.
DC is 100% justified here. Cruz shouldn’t have made those comments to the media if he claims he knows they’ll twist his words. What really happened is he made a highly unprofessional comment stemming from his own arrogance, then got called out on it but didn’t have the humility to say he was wrong.   He wasn’t “holding DC accountable.” He was being an asshole.
Cruz is wrong, some things must remain private.
Talking shit about a friend in public is unacceptable
You at 100k DC  Where's the cash at?  I need help paying rent this month could you help a brotha out
Dominick is a guy who doesn't argues but debate or discusses on a topic and that's the best thing❤️
chales breakdown is great as well
Long time subscriber om Bispings channel, just subscribed to this too. Can't get too much of a good thing
Jock drama.
You need to make this a show guys!!! Don’t worry about RC and DC, DC squared
I don’t like Dominick’s commentating at all. It’s just like his fighting style.. very boring and dry!
DC is about loyalty, trust and brotherhood,he's a top guy,.Dominic is wrong, when a brother is a brother it's ,forever..Correcting a brother in private earns you more respect.
I obviously don't know Dom, but he sometimes comes off as an embodiment of "with friends like this, who needs enemies?" Like the "accountability is love" saying "when you hold your kids accountable, that's love." Yes, but there's a difference between talking to your kid at home and holding them accountable for studying and doing homework, etc. and dropping off your kid and yelling at them on their way to class in front of classmates "hey, try paying attention in class and maybe you won't f* up so badly on the test."  Saying he mutes DC and that DC doesn't prepare and is just there for a paycheck is throwing DC under a bus and potentially would limit his career. Regardless of what else he said before then, that statement is basically telling other people "I don't think DC's worth listening to and he shouldn't even be in this position, since you can remove his voice completely and it wouldn't make a difference." Seriously, there's a difference between having an opinion and expressing that diplomatically, especially if he's going to say DC's his friend.  Bisping breaking this up and trying to be a mediator in this is hilarious though.
Dominick as analyst - "Conor let Khabib punch his face to make Khabib tired". What an amazing analyst
Dom has got to be the most passive aggressive person on earth lol
This was great!
DC you’re right, Cruz being a two-faced bitched. He should fight you
Josh Thomson said it right in his podcast with Big John : Who needs enemies when one's got friend like Dom'
DC, I love this video! You guys are so transparent! It's what we (the fans) love about all you guys! And yes, Cruz is super dry!
Dominic was wrong for saying that, if u love your brother u don't throw him under the bus in front of the entire world. Dominic is a snake!
I love Bisping, he's absolutely hilarious while being a gent
That looks like true friendship to me. Also it was entertaining DC so you shouldn't have cut it short. I think yall all bring a different view point in the analysis department. All of which are entertaining
Good post DC.  Cruz must be slightly in the spectrum.  Deep down I think he knows you're right.  You can see it fleetingly.
So funny how Cruz really seem to not understand how throwing your colleague under the bus publicly is a dick move.
Guys, Cruz said that Connor was gasing out Khabib by blocking ground & pound with his face.
Funny how Cruz brings up his fights that Cormier  comments
These 3 guys are the best!!👏👏👏😎
DC called Pedro Munhoz after this video  🤣
Dom "He's trying to gas Khabib out" Cruz stays being a douchebag.
Ok so I was watching this video on newsbreak and came to YouTube so I could leave this comment. DC I've honestly never liked you BUT I must admit, you are a much better commentator than cruz. Just listen to him on the khabib and Conor fight. Like good lord man what are you even talking about, cruz?
Dom, as smart as he supposedly is, is clueless to the fact that most people do not like arrogant asshole. Dom is by far my least favorite commentator; he’s boring and arrogant.
What a kid Cruz is. Bisping: "There's no right or wrong here" Cruz: "Exactly, that's what I am saying, I am not wrong."
Dom talks about Daniel not doing homework but he forgets he's mindless/nonsensical commentary in the Khabib vs Connor fight.. #Hypocrite😑#HaveACokeAnd🤐
what dom did was dirty imo. if dc is really your friend, just say what you have to say to his face. don't say it to the media..dom is definitely not a good friend lol.
what a total crap fest that turned into
Great video! Accountability is love!!
When Bisping showed up, I lost it. 😅😅😅
Cruz is wrong for this one. You should NOT throw your friend/colleague under the bus 🚌 like that.
Isn't DC combating the comment "he doesn't watch fights" in the first over 3 minutes? LOL
DC is a sensitive dude 😂🤣
DC being kind here, Cruz's commentary is laughable on occasion.
Cormier thinks he’s an MMA genius. He’s an over opinionated idiot that never gets it right.
Dom has been this way his whole career you either deal with it and understand  that's who he is or stay out his way
Best UFC interview ever period.
Dom should of never said nothing not cool
awesome
See when you're a cerebral guy like Dom that spends his time analysing everything, sometimes it's easy to take your analysis as fact. He was so sure that DC doesn't watch film based on their private conversations that he proceeded to misrepresent him in public. It's fine saying your opinion Dom, but you didn't give an opinion. You misrepresented DC as a lazy commentator that doesn't bother to do his homework and only shows up to cash the money and leave. There was nothing you said that implied it was opinion like saying "I think...." or "I may be wrong but I feel DC doesn't watch film...." etc etc. You gave an incorrect analysis on DC and proceeded to treat it as fact and thus misrepresented him. Dom needs to learn to take accountability the same way he preaches it.
Dom thinks everyone else is not doing the job and he takes the job way too seriously, throwing everyone under the bus and taking the fun out of it. Dom just stick to fighting then retire. 😴
Bisping as always is The Man !
I would be so annoyed trying to talk to Dominic Cruz, constantly butting in and trying to invalidate everything you say to the point of contradicting even himself. Smh
This is great content to build up their fight for 2022.
DC has a very high fight IQ I sometimes hear him say and pick up some things the others dont .He is very good for the sport Dominic is overly sensative but also good but not the same level .
Lmao I just watched 11 mins and it felt like 1 min.
Cruz is a legitimate sociopath. I’m sure he’s been diagnosed and he’s heavily medicated
How vain can a guy get: "Just give me..." "You need to..." "I'm fine..." "That's your job.." "Give me feedback..." "It's not my fault..." No professional courtesy. To say that is just about collecting money....come on. I mean, what a wanker. His days are certainly numbered...and he's numbering them.
What comes across here is Cruz has zero respect for DC. DC seems despot be friends with Cruz. Everybody knows a private conversation shouldn’t be aired out in public. To ask who made that rule is a bit of bitch move and shows the disdain Cruz holds for DC. He even compares him to a kid. Maybe he feels disrespected by DC and therefore giving it back. Either way this doesn’t sound or look a healthy relationship if there is one.
We need a mojahed cartoon to this lol
DC: "You throw a punch, punch." Dom: "A punch punch....?"
I love this. This is what humanity is all about. Great energy ✊
Love all three of you, great knowledge of commentaring fights. But Count is Count.. ☝️
Dom is right to an extent but I enjoy listening to DC more. There's a reason Shaq and Kenny are the most celebrated NBA analysts. At the end of the day this is entertainment.
Could these two just fight already
Dc’s butt is literally sticking out of the chair lol
Here's my opinion, and an HONEST ASSESSMENT of DC and Cruz's Commentary Skills...  DC is right, in the sense that.... You don't just blast your colleague for the hell of it in an interview.. If you have a problem with his LACK OF PREPARATION.. And you supposedly "LOVE HIM LIKE A BROTHER!!" Then you just talk to him privately and, ask for him to pull his weight.. With that said, I don't know how DC's LACK OF Film Study, affects their partnership behind the scenes.. But as a SUPER HARDCORE UFC and Pro Wrestling along with bigger Boxing Fights Student I am.. I pay A LOT MORE ATTENTION than I should on commentary teams, play-by-play talent, color commentators, and analysts.. I look for chemistry and all of that.. Too me, DC is more of a NATURAL at the job.. He has intangibles on commentary, that YOU WILL NOT TEACH OR WILL HAVE TO WORK SO HARD AT IT, THAT IT WILL NOT COME ACROSS AS NATURAL!! For what his role is on commentary, he does it AWESOME!! Now usually that NATURAL ABILITY comes with a LACK OF PREPARATION!! Because your so effortlessly good at it, that you may not work as hard at it.. DC has a certain commentary-friendly charisma that Cruz will never have, no matter how much he tries.. I like Cruz on commentary better now than when he started but, you can also tell he has to work harder to not make the mistakes he makes.. DC is more of a SOUNDBYTES Style color commentator.. Cruz is more of an analyst.. Cruz would actually serve better on the desk, in my opinion.. He is more in-depth, so therefore I find that he over steps on commentary, doesn't know how to GET IN and GET OUT with his commentary, gets to rambling on at times too.. He's well-spoken, very smart, and thinks outside the box as opposed to keeping with a GENERAL OUTLINE!! Those are strong points, but as you see in this interview, he tends to OVER-TALK, and sometimes his message (even though smart and from a different view) comes off pretentious and somewhat condescending, which is not good in commentary.. DC while using a more GENERAL OUTLINE, and the amazing relatable charisma he has, along with a GENUINE EXCITEMENT, keeps it simple but, relatable to a casual fan.. I'm all for ACCOUNTABILITY but, I do believe Cruz could of handled it more professionally, but at the end of the day, as long as they can talk it over, work together (which it obviously looks like they can), it's really NO BIG DEAL!!
DOMINICK - It's far more respectful and loving to criticize in private.  If I knew you personally I would have said this privately  :)
So what they're saying is... Conor WAS gassing khabib out
Just a stunt to talk about .. a different angle just a head line storie
Lol It feels like I pulled up a chair and was there chillin too
Dominick Cruz is the type to tell everybody in the hood your business after a personal talk lol
Love the conversation. I don't agree w Dom though about having to go public to hold anyone accountable. Especially a friend.. Just pull him aside dude
remember Dominque once said Connor was tiring Khabib by making Khabib smashing him 😂
This is funny as hell. DC admitted to paying someone to watch film for him so technically Cruz is right. Even tho dC says he hasn't done it for awhile.
This S is funny as hell
It seems like it’s very difficult if not impossible for Dominic to make close friends. He might be closeted not that there’s anything wrong with that.
THIS GUY WAS analyzing  khabib vs conor , when khabib was smasing him cruz was saying that conor is making him tired .. man do you think this is analyzing .. and IN  ZABIT & Jeremy Stephens fight every time JOE said Zabit is good fighter CRUZ said ,, its only foot work ,,,  this guy should go to a good Psychologist
Dry!😂
Such a real ass video you gotta fuck with it 😂
Dom is such a loser
If Dom said this to you privately it's constructive criticism, if he says it publicly it wasn't said in love, that's it. DC probably said something during Dom's fight that he took personally, Dom says he doesn't make excuses for loses, but 100% he does.
Dom is a fool . He believes he’s way smarter than he is.    He just shit on one of his co workers in front of the world.  You can bet that no favors will be coming his way from anyone on that broadcast team.  Dc is a class act and the way he handled that shows that he’s a real man
Half joking half true once it’s over it’s over this is how athletes hangout and talk college to pro they make fun of eachother but in the end everyone knows it’s just a joke so anytbing goes and they argue about sports more than anyone these guys sport just so happens to be broadcasting now so they compete at that and make jokes
He's trying to throw shade at DC for not being a good analyst but DC is the best analyst this far in the UFC he has imperfections which make us like him more because it proves he is human and as for him hiring someone to do research, what person goes into any profession without being trained or taught Dominick's ego is too big he should take a more humble approach to life
If you’re explaining you’re losing! Get past it DC!
Dominick shouldn’t have said that publicly straight up
Dominic looking like a fuck boy  Fr 💯
Little surprised in Dom's stubbornness here, but hey, he's a champ. He'll change and improve like he always does.
Dominic is so wrong here. It's not his opinion that is the problem, but the way he expressed them. Plus, there's that not insignificant accusation that Cormier only does it for the money. That is a hit on Cormier's moral character.
Bisping realizing he needed a chair is the best part for me 🤣love these guys they’re like your uncles talking ish at the bbq
Cruz was a hell of a fighter but seems to be a baby when it comes to critcism. I saw his last fight and the kid easily figured out his movements and kicked his ass. He litterally has a fight coming up that he should be giving his attention to. Cruz knows he's towards the end of his career and is angry his name doesn't ring louder in the UFC.
DC and Cruz both have their points! Love em  both.
Daniel do your homework. I know you don't have Ariel helwani anymore but do your homework buddy
Micky Mouse ears Cruz
I wanna see dominck cruz lose tonight
DC is a stud Dom thinks his way is the only way. He will mature and figure out success and life comes in all different flavors. Don’t get me wrong I love them both!
*Cruz is a* 🤡 . *His* commentary is the Worst. Check out his commentary in Khabib vs Conor and Thug Rose vs Jessica Andrade. Completely *LAUGHABLE*
Yeah Cruz crossed the line.  Nobody would’ve known if DC doesn’t do his homework.  Maybe Cruz is bitter that he has to do more work than DC for xPay$??
"Watching fights" is not the same as "Watching film" DC..just admit you don't study as much as cruz
That ending got me pissed its looked like cruz didnt really want to solve this and be cool with dc. And that dc gave up on trying. Man i love dc he dont owe shit to this skinny weak ass fighter
Cruz holding people accountable since ages ago🤣🤣👍👍
imagine a podcast with Dominic Cruz and Joe Rogan 😥❤
Dc was a two division champ that had a great ufc career and fought the toughest guys out there we consider heavyweight goat Miocic or goat Jon Jones with all respect to Dominick Cruz dc can commentate a fight without knowing anything about a fighter at this point of his crazy good career
Dominick Cruz is not a reliable friend as far as I seen , I would trust DC more in the end of the day
When Dom said Bisbing threatening  to pick him up and toss him out a window lol
When bisping shows up it’s like when you’re having sodas with the lads and the other best lad shows up 😂
for there salary thhey should do the research by themselves for all the fights
I dont think the media did him dirty. It's literally what Dom said and the way he said it.  As Bisping said, it's professional courtesy to tell your colleague in private if he is doing something unacceptable to your standard, you don't just go public and start talking about it.  Dom has different definition of loyalty.  In fact id rather listen to DC and Joe Rogan all day long than Dom.
DC is the man.  F all his haters.  I'm over it.  Love this guy as an mma personality.
Dom was wrong for that 100%. Good stuff DC. Bisping is the best!!! Lmfao. Dom said “I didn’t say you were bad” & literally said “I mute him because he doesn’t watch film. He comes to make his money & leaves”. Like what is that suppose to mean lmfao 🤣
I agree with you DC , it was not professional saying that , i like Dominick as well , but you are 100% correct , As a collie, as a friend or as a Man 💪
DC cruise is just jealous of you (DC everything you do, you do it brightly and interestingly!))
Cruz is wrong for this smh grow tf up
I’m on Dominick’s side all the way dude just says it how he sees it.
Respect to both but dom pisses me off
DC is amazing who cares if Dom watches more film. I think you can be more authentic if you talk with some flavor/comedy and I agree with DC 100 percent that Dom is a little dry.  It was very disappointing to hear Dom say he mutes DC. That is total bs and uncalled for.
Cruz kinda comes off like an asshole lol it’s like he just says stuff and then when he’s asked to explain his explanations are always hollow and he just acts like what he said was fact without any real explanation. He just tries to trick people into making him look right by continually asking hollow questions
Anyone else get almost psychopath-level narcissism vibes from Cruz. Actually found that really uncomfortable to watch. How doesn’t he understand that he’s throwing his colleague under the bus by doing that?
YOU dont say anything bad ABOUT YOUR teamates…..THAT Cruz is A bad “FRIEND”
They should get married. 😁😀
They clearly friends but it’s common sense keep the stuff between yourselves why talk to the press
1 minute in. 😂
Like
doms not wrong . how did you think this was going to look good
Dom ”I didnt do anything wrong” bullying and gaslighting. Poor DC has to suffer always with these types of personalities.
Doms just in his feelings
Dom is a really dumb smart person 😂
I needed this
https://youtu.be/emBu6_HcqSA
Dom Cruz gaslighting with nonstop hypothetical questions. Speak on the subject, Dom.
This is great.
Cruz is a great analyst but he is for sure boring as all hell. I think most people would choose DC over Cruz
4:54 he is exploiting DC's weakness of not wanting to be critical
I loved DC as a fighter but his commentary is awful, started off solid but he puts in zero effort now that he's secured the gig.
Had to sub from this video. Had me dying 🤣
This is great. Can't find analysts with this energy in any other sport.
This is literally the best DC content. He should thank Dominick
DC secretly hoping Dom gets his jaw broke off.
One of the greatest MMA videos of all time.
Dominick “Conor was taking punches to gas Khabib out” Cruz, what you gonna do when the AKA, Gilroy, San Jose, Olympic Rasslin, New Orleans, and Dagestani DC fans run wild on you…social media wise?
They are too competitive to be commentators!😬
Dom just want to argue… I hate when people do that…
Cruz can throw DC under the bus exposing personal information and be like "hey don't get mad at me" but then he refuses to accept that his commentary is bland? He's the most bland commentator in UFC history. Don't dish it out if you can't take it
Dc the man, love watching UFC when he commentating 🎤
That poor chair under DC holding for dear life lmao
Dominic cruz is an asshole. As a friends we don't burn the other in public and without even saying it laughing, he was totally serious. DC is in the 0.001% of the best guys in the world in term of loyalty, friendship and values so no one touch him !
Sodium sounds so good right now ..
Lol is that lens distortion or cormiers head is twice the normal size?
Ok now I know what doms problem is they treat him like the small guy "ill pick you up you little basted and throw you through the window" 🤣 🤣 🤣  he replayed that moment so many times lol
Cruz would be an excellent lawyer.
*DC is the kind of guy who is only friends with people that agree with him. You can't be authentic if all your friends are yes men. I should've stuck with reading the transcripts. Trying to listen to this was a nightmare. DC should get a job at FOX "News" since he loves to talk over the guests. It's also obvious that DC is drunk every time he commentates, but yet they fired Goldie for supposedly the same thing. Hypocrites.*
Remember, mercy and truth are met together! (Psalm 85:18) DC has been called out by few (so-called) friends here lately! Both of which have held him accountable! Justin Gaethje and now Dominick Cruz....So, have we learned a lesson yet?
Dom sounds like he doesn't have a brain
Dom is a old man in a young body thats his problem and you can still see it,your super dry dude
Commentary needs all types of entertainment. Not just about watching film. Different people bring different styles to commentary to relate to all types of people. Thats why there are play by play guys, color commentators etc. Cruz is a wrong for calling out DC. Wrong for calling out Keith Peterson.
This is funny because Dom says stuff like Conor is letting khabib get tired by punching him in the face. And mike calls 10-8 for every other fight 😂😂😂 DC is one the best commentators period!
I love all 3 of them. I think they are even better commentators than they were fighters. Dom shouldn't have said anything but then we would not have had this gem. Hopefully, they are still friends.
As a "professional" colleague I would have had this discussion behind closed doors if it really bothered me that much. Cruz is being an idiot if he doesn't think that people wouldn't focus on his soundbite "I mute DC commentary" like c'mon dude. I appreciate DC's energy, passion and experience behind the mic... I wouldn't air out my grievances in public if I truly loved my colleague that was a cop out by Cruz.  I remember a lot of fights that DC called, I'm finding it almost impossible to remember ANY Cruz commentary so yeah Cruz work on yourself before calling out your fellow colleagues makes you look like a chump.
Dom thought Khabib was gonna gas out against Conor in the 2nd round but he pretends to research fighters before their fights. What a clown 🤡  He’s going to be remembered for that embarrassing moment more than anything else.
someone tell what shoes dominic is wearing
Everyone has a Dominick Cruz at work 🤣 🤣 🤣
Dom is so funny 😂
DC this was Freaken Amazing.... I agree with you 100% though Dom should've never spoke like that about you live. #JustMyOpinion
This was gold 😂
Hey Champ, DC. Why is the Dominator, Causing all this Pressure for himself right before a fight. I think its a bit testy. And I prefer Listening to you any day, Over cruz and his egotistical voice. You keep it Real.
I love these dudes
Dominick Cruz drier then a Popeyes biscuit
Dominic Snooze, you are horrible!!! Best commentary team : (Rogan, Anik, DC)
I hope these guys record their golf games together when they're in their 60's
Totally agree with dc. Absolutely wrong of Cruz to call out his friend like that to the media.
I didn’t say you were bad I said I hit the mute button when you do your commentary so I don’t have to listen to it because it’s really,,,,,,,,,,,, good?  WTF? Lol
I could watch hours of these guys just shooting the shit about anything.
*Bisping sent me here. Subscribed.*
DC will always be whining about something
when dom ask which punch and dc tells him hes looking like dang... he does watch the fights
Bisping was exactly what we needed in this convo xD
Dom is a smart guy and a good fighter. But as a friend/collegue/trusted person hes a total piece of s***. Hes lucky DC aint the kinda person to confront him physically (even though Dom probably thinks he can beat him). And no, Dom is not the best analyst! His commentary is very arrogant and disrespectfull, just like his persona.
He’s right. Your commentating needs work. Take the criticism and work on it. I personally don’t care for your commentating. You don’t need to be there tbh.
As an ENTP, I think Dominick is 100% ENTP, this is so relatable lmao
Dom said he's  holding DC accountable, but he wanted no accountability when talking about the media twisting stuff. Literally 100% of the population knows the media twists comments, but he wants to act like he has no fault in the media printing this the way it was smh
DC is right not everything should be public
Where's Cruz's channel dedicated to the sport including interviews with fighters?
This is like going at it with your girl, you can’t win 😂😂
Dominick Cruz: He wants to gas Khabib out...  DD is a dick.
I agree with Cruz.  Accountability (which is a word a lot our fellow Americans struggle with) is love.  Way to stand your ground.
Dom broke the bro code and he should be excommunicated.
Daniel Cormier is great I enjoy watching and listening to him do his thing and I can’t see how Cruz would think that there’s anything positive or constructive about him stabbing is “friend” in the back publicly like this.  Props To bisping for injecting them self in the middle of it and trying to keep things comfortable while Cruz continues to live in his own ego and think he’s the one that’s right all the time.
I see a lot of people trying to rationalize this whole situation but I don’t find it to be entertaining at all especially with the recent issues that have been going around Cormier and his commentating.  If I ever had to choose between having friends like Cruz or having no friends at all, well let’s just say that would be a no-brainer.  I’d rather be a lonely person than ever have a friend like that douche bag Dominic. And while we’re on the subject I’ll bet money that Dominic is a very lonely person with nothing more than a ridiculous big ass ego.
Cruz thinks he’s much more intelligent than he he actually is…. DC all day for me
Dom was wrong.
Congrats on the 100k DC
Dom is one of those guys who always needs to be right.
Dom is the Real DC
Dom is a savage 😂 On a side note: Stuff like this confirms the story from a while back where I believe Formiga said he had a street fight with Cruz for being a douche 😂
Yeah agree with DC Dom should’ve said that to the media about DC tell him privately and help him improve that’s what’s friends do
"punch punch knee tap" omg I love DC, this is like when you didn't read the book in school
DEAR D.C DONT WORRY ABOUT DOM. HE WAS RAISED BY A RACIST FAMILY. HE LOVES YOU BUT CANT HELP TO HATE YOU AT THE SAME TIME.
You guys couldn't be a more perfect combination for intertaining sports commentary & y'all educate the audience all in the same process!! DC is lovable & while very intelligent,  but a bit " impromptu style" where Cruez is the " critiquer"!  The two opposite ends of commentary styles  somehow close in all one needs to know about a given fight & fighters!  It doesn't take a marketing genius to see that these guys aren't going anywhere & thank goodness for that!!!
Can we get Jones to shut DC up...he's so arrogant.
DC looking like the Dad justifying his actions to his son after his kid calls him out 😆 #DoAsISayNotAsIDo   Seriously tho I love that we get to see this straight talk between two professionals, friends and long time colleagues. No BS. Btw MEDIA, don't miss quote this great conversation.
I love this 😂❤️
Communication saves relations
DC looked hurt towards the end when even after he said exactly what he though Cruz wouldn't budge. Cruz was wrong and broke the code. Accountability is one thing, attacking a brother's livelihood is another.
Michael Bisping seriously makes brings so much levity and likability wherever he goes. It’s crazy to think that the guy who spit on his opponent’s cornermen is now my favorite commentator and mma personality
Dom is a great analyst but there is no way I could deal with him personally. He has zero redeeming social aspects.
Can't stand cruz too arrogant
Cruz being honest... DC knows... flustered.
Oh, Man. It  is so simple: when someone critcize a brother, that guy need to do this in private. Dom was not wise and their friendship Will not be the same.
funny.  Dom said nothing wrong.  just listen and learn.  we still like you DC.  just do better....no biggie.
Who are you to tell someone what they need to do he is pulling the Show Me Your Papers BS.
Cruz is a hater and don’t like that DC gets more attention than him.  Cruz want to have it both ways he is a bitter little hater that will never be happy so he have hate on people around him.  When you almost comes to blow with everyone you are around you are the problem you are the common denominator.
How could one possibly not click with this thumbnail?  Also, Dominick Cruz is not a person you would like to be associated with.
Probably one of the BEST interviews!!! Lol
Cormier > Cruz hands down
DANIEL!!!! TAP OUT!!! PLEASE TAP OUT!!! Lol
I gotta be real I lost some respect for Dom after watching this. He really was stubborn and unable to see DC's side of things... Yes, you are of course allowed to have an opinion. If i think my coworker never does ___ and it's a problem, I am allowed to think that. However, that doesn't mean its right to bring it up at a large company meeting. If you truly want accountability, discuss it with him privately.
DC UR WEAK BROTHER 🙄
It's funny these two arguing about commentating, when everytime Jon anik opens his mouth I can't help but roll my eyes and can't wait till he shuts his mouth. Love these guys
Dc trying to make a point and separate the tension between the smaller man
Dom is DRY! Cormier told the truth and hmmmm, Dom seemed to disagree. This is the same thing as what Dom did to DC. Just opinions.
Thier is bad work right thier on dom he is not a Olympic gold medalist.  They all suck .  Rogan is better with facts and so is John. But they all need to do research point blank!
Imagine if all three of these guys were in the room with you, mad enough to fight you...
I cant believe that Bisping became the man he is today, much more professional, much more respectful and he is a great analyst and has natural charm, and on the other hand we have DC who as older he gets, he is acting like a kid, more and more often disrespectful towards fighters, and i know people are forgetful but i aint, those eye pokes and those dirty strategies he used while he was a fighter will always be a stain on his career. While Dom can be a little boring but his analysis are always on point, and he is a professional as a fighter and at the desk.
i just realised this whole dom started is to get people to watch him fight
Dom has always been the most interesting interview in MMA.
Wow great conversation! Give Micheal a chair :)
Cruz is a clown for that … you the man DC
I Love these guys!!
These guys are the best 😅🔥
Damn never noticed how annoying Dominick Cruz was so annoying
IF I didnt have the Jon Jones fights to compare DC's mentality to, I would think DC was too accepting of the attacks he gets for his- imo -great commentary.  DC has a way of doing mental gymnastics that few possess , to see Cruz not yield  after DC went out of his way ,  bro has to be commended
"You dont think you're dry?" "NO" "Dominic Cruzzzzzz." Lmao
DC is rite BUT cruz is rite as well
DC next to Dominick Cruz looks like he ate Dominick Cruz sized human
I like  Dom  but  he is being  a  cock..  Dc  is  the best  ..  not  everyone  is  the same analyst,   i like  both  and  Bisping  is  great
There is no doubt that Dom is the driest commentator on the desk. Dude is white bread bland
Dominique's  Is one of those dirty friends that will backstab you or tell your girl about something you did🤦‍♂️
Dom looks like a clown here
These 3 dudes are hilarious 😂 😂😂
How is it 'love' when Dom says he mutes DC's commentary? That has nothing to do with honesty, in my book that is backstabbing. One on one, you can say that to a friend as constructive criticism. But questioning the work ethic of your colleague by boasting. Gtfoh. Get Dan Hardy back.
Cruz is a little broke weirdo.  DC played it well!
Thank you God for Bisping. What an absolute fun guy.
There is no love without hate -Nick Diaz
Can't believe havnt seem this yet, should be good !
Dom made a great point about being prepared for work to show respect. Daniel made a great point about loyalty and respecting personal relationships.  Neither man is wrong here in any way.
Dom deffo in the wrong, however to be fair to him I don’t think he would mind if DC did it to him. Which means it wasn’t personal, however still undermines his friend/ colleague DC. For Dom to say it’s the media’s fault was a big cop out, as we all know what the media like. That was very disingenuous
Dom pulled a dick move , plain and simple.  There are just things that you don't say about your friend,  ESPECIALLY to the media!!!!
Yo DC, just wanted to let you know that besides a Double champ perspective, I' here for the money you promised on Bisping's video 😉
Domenic destoyed DC
Breath of fresh air 💪🏼
Dom is butthurt
Dominic said that DC is an olimpic gold medalist))))))and DC was like ok why not :)))
Honestly i dont care how much research Jon Anik does ... he's boring af. This is entertainment. Dc does it good.
I love it when 10 minutes into the fight Cruz said "ok, maybe not watching film works for you" 😂 Reminds me of arguing with my girlfriend...
Not disrespecting others but dominick looks and sounds alpha there.
DC is right shouldnt have been said publicly as a friend and Colleague...but dom is the type of guy who is never wrong and stubborn. Lol i know people like this in my life they never admit there wrong ....
Chael sent me here.
ok, ok. Being a prick is not just a character for Cruz
D!!!!!C!!!!! YOU THE MAN!!! LUV FROM NZ! LESKOOOO...
DC breakdowns in fights are suburb, especially in wrestling exchanges while Dominick is he guy who called a guy is trying to gassing the opponent with headbutts on his knucles while flat on his back
Cruz is too damn smart! He’ll have you playing mental gymnastics. If I had too choose between DC and Cruz when it comes to commenting and analyzing fights, I’d pick Cruz all day
Dom is wrong here, he has an issue, go and speak with DC etc. You don't go and release it to the world.
best ufc related content all week
cormier showed his impatience at the end lol
“Im not dry I add sodium to everything” lmao
Dom is dead wrong in this and his ego won’t allow him to apologize to DC he should’ve never had said this on air
DC arse is sneaking out of the chair🤣🤣
Jus lost respect for domenick cruz
Just rag doll him DC 🤣🤣🤣
DC and Bisping are more color commentary and Cruz is a more play by play type analyst. Both styles mesh great
Lol Dominic is so spikey  🤣  fantastic double team here. I’d watch the, on a podcast all day.
This is like a “Facts vs Feelings” demonstration 🤣🤣 Cruz is all facts no filter and DC is facts but taking feelings and other factors into account.
This is dumb if they know media will twist it what they arguing over? These guys way worse then girls and old gossiping ladies
Dominick was a BETRAYER, there is no way around that...
😂😂😂😂🙌🏼
Gotta respect any man that'd sooner be sent into orbit than give up an atom of principle.
I thought Dominic was trying to keep his heart rate down before fights! LOL
Dom is so insecure
You are  wrong Daniel… he felt that way based on your performance, simple as that. Very true styles are different, not everyone can be as good as Dominick as an analyst, etc but irrelevant. You can do better and prepare better If you want to improve but stop the rationalizations and side stepping.
Im glad for Doms sake that everyone has taken well to this discussion because I think he's a fucking Snake. I would tell DC not to invite that man into your home. A friend would have said the things Dom said privately, even a colleague that wished you well would. And the ironic part is DC is far more liked then Dom as a commentator, Dom is one of the least liked commentators. Also, he sounds like a narcissist. DC calling him dry was being polite!! and watch how quick he was to be defensive against the comment.
I just don’t understand why DC considers him a “friend”. Cruz is a complete a*hole with no sense of friendship and sensitivity. You don’t say stuff like like dumb head.
I love 7:24 😭😭😭😭😂😂
LOOL Bisping appearing from nowhere
Dom sounds like my toxic ex girlfriend
Now that was an amazing episode. lmaoooo Dom is a fucking asshole and i love it.
Dominick negatives? How’s about Conor Khabib? Conor is trying to gas Khabib 😂
1:30 that was not love haha dom strait up said dc is only there for the pay check
Cruz is cringe
DC tryin to get public revenge on some slight words the DAY before Dom fights?  - eh.  I say blast him after man... come on DC, my man weight cuttin.
Dom forgets that's there's more to being a great analyst than just the pure knowledge. He's not giving the proper respect to how big a factor personality is to the commentary role. Dom can be argued as the best technical commentator but he is far down the list of commentators that the fans like for their personality.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 100% best show men hahahhaha we need more of this
Dom is a bit dry on commentary.  But it's ok because he makes up for it with his super human knowledge. DC isn't at Dom's level of technical analysis, but he makes up for it with his super human likeability. Both is great. Dom comes off as a bit of a dick. DC comes off as a wonderful human being.
DC looking chunky!
DC is always touching someone and it’s hilarious
This whole thing was an incredibly brilliant marketing move by Dom during fight week. However, this was also a ginormous dick move. Complete win if you're the type of person that would sell out what I believe is his friend,  but at the very least his co-worker. I hope DC gets a billion views on this video as a Karmic reparation.
Cruz gets offended easy
I enjoy DC commentating he says absolutely whatever
DC may as well work for CNN. Fill that Cuomo seat. Apparently he throws 90mph fastballs too. Dom set him on fire. DC is a sellout. Basically talks like a politician these days. Needs a Jones beatdown. 105k subs should speak for itself. Clown show
Sodium? Lol
DC is my man, he handled that soo good that it felt staged.
Ah shame. Poor DC
Both DC and Bisping knew how the media would run with Dom's words. I agree with DC here. Dom's stance is that he's not wrong for having an opinion. But that's not the issue. It's how you voice that opinion and whether or not it should be voiced publicly. If these guys are friends and Dom has no issues "keeping it real" then DC should have heard his opinion first in private. Otherwise the criticism is not constructive at all. It's just him talking shit.
DC is a fantastic commentator
DC and Cruz - 2 guys who have to be the smartest guy in the room and the "right" guy in every situation.  Both are beyond arrogant.  Bisping is the man though!
DC butt popping out 😅😅💉💉💉
Dom shouldn't have said what he said publicly, tbh. Yes, Daniel Cormier has moments where he's biased on the commentary team, the same way that Dom has been completely inaccurate with the strategies he's thinks fighters are adopting in the cage. Point is, they were (not sure if they still are) both coworkers, veterans of an extremely violent sport, both former champions, ect. A "no comment" would have been a much better move if the respect is there. Honestly I prefer DC on the commentary team, he's just a funny dude. Cruz is sharp as hell, not taking away from him, but DC is just a warm personality. Bisping, Rogan, DC, and Dom is a dream team together- so long as they don't interupt eachother. Anik is a pro aswell, but I do miss Dan Hardy in there
The hypocrisy on Cruz we still haven’t forgotten how he called the Conor n Khabib fight as a Conor fanboy drooling n waiting for the for that left punch the whole fight and Conor absorbing the ground punches to tire Khabib . Some analyst you are . DC all day over the shit bag
I don’t think that Dominic Cruz is dry, he’s good at what he does.
Bisping hijacked the flow lol right as DC was making his point, Bisping moves in oblivious to what the discussion was about and probably made Dom feel vindicated. I hate when ppl do that shit lol poor DC...first Gaejthe now Cruz
Is Dominc a sociopath? You don't call your colleague lazy and showing up to work just to collect the paycheck. You have a private conversation with him if you are unhappy. Second - if the company pays and keeps Daniel that means they like him. They pay him, it's for them to like him. Third - can Dominic prove Daniel does NOT watch enough film and he comes unprepared?  Fourth - you think it's good for the company for this beef to happen? It's good for the team work? God bless Daniel for being the smarter man. Dominic is a weirdo with zero social awareness, no wonder the dude doesn't have a family in his late 30s.
This is classic
These are like two ufc lawyers arguing
Lol you wanna see how bad dominic cruz is, watch the connor vs khabib bout.. hes the worst commentator in the ufc!
Cormier touched Dom so many times in the leg and Dom let it happen... the first time DC touched Bisping in the leg Bisping stopped looked at his face, looked at his hand and had the look of WTF are you doing DC
Fuckin love these guys 👍
Dom is hilarious
I like seeing the realness. I could listen to them go back and forth for hours
These Guys are fucking great together!!!😂🤣😂
It's clear that DC thinks tuning into the fights live like everybody else is "watching film" lmao
Oh man, DC & Cruz is going to beat DC & Helwani and DC & RC by a landslide🥳 Dominic is the Yin to Daniels Yang😂❤️❤️❤️
Saying dry is the nicest way to tell him, he's super opiniated and comes across annoying. I have to be right! can't just enjoy the fight and put opinions aside for a second.
DC watch film
Just fight already.
Uncle Chael said it best, DC gets an A and Dom gets an A+.
“I saw loosing fights, I saw winning fights, I saw all fights!”    Is he, dr. Seuss?  “You don’t think you are dry?”   Lol I’m crying
Dom is like that stubborn friend who can never be wrong 😂
I think that Dom has been a douche with all of this stuff. He seems to be missing the point: if you have some issues with how your colleague, who's also your friend, does his job, be a fucking professional and address it with him privately. DC seemed to want to let Dom speak his piece here, but Dom just doesn't seem to get it, and it was obvious by the end of it that DC is just over it and has better things to do with his time. This even ended up being a waste of Bisping's time.
Guy watches fights while having popcorn and Dom you are telling him he doesn’t watch film.. not before the fights of course
Dominick is such a dork
Dominick threw Daniel under the bus, not cool. Thats a Rat like attitude and will lose him respect
5:58 great reaction from Dom hahaha
“DC smelled like alcohol and cigarettes so who knows what he was doing?”                             - Dominick Cruz
I find Dom Cruz a bit of a bellend
Lol these guys keep saying we love each other. Sounds like complete BS to me
DC the goat 🤣 he handled this like a gem
Dominick Cruz should've watched some of Khabib's tapes before the Connor fight. Maybe then he would've known that Connor was actually getting destroyed and not gasing Khabib out.
I hope Cruz didn't pull this stunt off because he's jealous that DC's out of cage stock continues to rise. Really crappy thing to say about DC. Came off like an upset kid.
Dominic is just a brat
This is how DC and Cruz earn youtube views
DC we wanted to see it continue! I guess Dom does know best.
This is epic
Dom is Dry 💯
i love what the ufc is doing with these guys .... im getting heavy "inside the nba" vibes from this and its something that will do nothing but good things for the sport
But on the real tho Dom is right he should be able to criticize DC in public. BUT the fact that he went so overboard with it saying he mutes it if its DC and all that was why it was just straight disrespectful
5:34 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How about all of y'all are kinda lame and boring. All HOFers but what exactly are they "commenting on" anyway??- usually just a bunch of babble that us fans have been hearting same nothing nothing blah blah for years now. We'd like to hear more about the 'behind the scenes' kind of stuff- not the obvious "he threw a hook and a low kick, and landed". Afterall- you guys have been those athletes in those locker rooms and training camps- talk more about those experiences, as well as what each current fighter is/has endured to get through their camp/career. PC has everything staying too conservative...its pretty boring listening to ALL of these guys. Maybe some fresh voices would be beneficial for all??
Bisbing plugging himself at the end was hilarious
Over familiarity breeds contempt 🤷🏽‍♂️
Nah Cruz commentating is boring as hell sometimes. Most of the time.
I wish DC would have said the only thing you did wrong was not being a good friend.  I would add, Don't fix it if it ain't broke!
It’s obvious Cruz can’t spaz out on himself for being in the prelims and having bad career so he’s taking it out on DC . How petty Cruz is
Dom has a fight ahead and you try to publicly confront him saying he was publicly honest. Dick move!
The type of class and standard of a man that DC upholds. You can tell he was hurt by this. To put the guy you sit beside shoulder to shoulder on blast in such a cynical fashion publicly is wrong and we all know it. Accountability is good. But this wasn’t that. There’s a difference between saying, “hey DC you gotta watch more film” , compared to “hey media, DC is underprepared and in this for the money”   Cruz is “wrong”, and you can tell he hates hearing that, too. May he get his comeuppance Saturday.
Such a classic
I’ve gotta mute DC’s commentary when I’m playing UFC4 to be honest
I love Dom, but as men we shouldn't do something like that. I feel bad for him that no one taught him that while he was young.
Dominick such a sucker for bad mouthing his friend and work colleague... If you have any intentions of helping a friend improve professionally , you should do it privately and not throw him to the wolves publicly.
cruz trippin hard
DC all day. Cruz is a snake
That was AWESOME….
Fine fine you're all allowed to join me and my wife during out next session.
I think Cruz is a bit aspergers or something lmao
This is great. I dont know if this shit is scripted or what. DC kept it all the way funky handled our boy Dominick Cruz and his passive aggressive - dick like attitude. And then classic Bisping comes in perfect timing to alleviate and break the tension. Much love and respect to you champions.
Dom's son: "I love you daddy" Dom: "You're not a good son, now tell me what you hate about me."
If Mike Bisping is not Kano from Mortal Kombat IDK who is.
I don’t blame DC for not watching old fights , boring as hell to watch any fight where you know the outcome . I think DC is a pretty entertaining commentator . Joe rogan used to be entertaining but now he’s become to technical which is boring .
Cruz is almost hyper critical...and well...who tf  really wants to work with a guy like that?  🤷‍♂️
The three stooges right here 😂😂😂
Loving this channel big man  5:58 love Bisping
Bisping is either the best or worst person to mediate anything
Commentators commentate differently. They are TV personalities, Cruz adds alittle more detail and of where maybe a fighter originated his coaching from and how they have evolved but Dc just calls the fight as they play out like he the "HYPE man of the group" and Cruz is the detail guy and Anik is the Mediator with the commercials ads
DC you truly handled yourself like a professional. The accusation from peers and colleague against is everyday. Dominik Cruz need to research micro aggressions and the exhaustion of dealing with such every freaking day from many different angles
Lmao DC has a YouTube channel? This is awesome
Lol, I thought Dom is probably a Virgo, because in my experience, they're perfectionists & can be critical of those on their 'team' that aren't working hard (not to mention an outward, super brainy, unemotional vibe, which can make them 'dry').  At least, they do work really hard & are diligent.  This makes them look like A-holes but hey, we all have are issues & blind spots.  SURE ENOUGH I looked it up & he is...
3 Goats 🐐
Dom's impression of bisping was spot on lol
Dom needs to admit he was WRONG and should of took this up with DC PRIVATELY not publicly....until he publicly apologizes to DC he is going to lose a lot of fans ....I don't think he realizes how much of a complete JERK he is coming off.......RIGHT?
"You're gone, who knows what you're doing"       Is this real? Domonique is getting applauded?  FOR THIS?  Tells you where our society is. Slobbering mongrels with the humility and common sense of a ROCK. Pathetic.
This is the best thing ever
Haha good effort lads
"Accountability is love"  Question: How in the FK is  DC "accountable" to this impudent, spoiled brat?
“I make the determination that you don’t watch fights based on your commentary.”   “What did I say?”  “I mute your commentary.”  🤦‍♂️💩🤦‍♂️💩
Little worm played DC like a fiddle. Hope he goes out on a stretcher.
Ironically I am not at all a fan of Cuz’ commentary
Man lets this weasel talk total bs to him, then deletes comments when he gets defended. Pathetic.
Idk why but 30 seconds into this I'm already laughing my ass off and nothing has even happened yet
Dom: when I HEARD you call my fight  Dc:what did I say wrong during your fight ?  Dom: idk I muted it   Like what ?? Lol
I already thought DC wasn’t good at commentating. But Cruz a snitch for that. He should of never said that publicly
Cruz is viciously smart....maybe when he gets older he'll lighten up 😂
Dom could ankle pick both these cats at the same time all while on the cell phone with Caesar,  the dog whisperer , trying to figure out why Dojo can't 💩
Dominic is so lame for all of this and his attitude. All respect gone which there wasn’t much there to begin with
This is awesome
Does Dom really enjoy being hated?
We love your commentary DC, you Rogan and Anik are the best in the game
This is why DC needs Ariel
I think the most annoying thing about how Dominic Cruz argues is how calm he says the shit that he says. That dead pan delivery is coming from a place of extreme confidence in his own thoughts that you cannot shake. DC saw that and was like this is useless. In hindsight cody vs dom was fire vs ice. I'm glad Cody won cuz it was a win for ppl that wear their heart on their sleeves. Dominic is the nicest dickhead you'll ever meet.
Anik, Joe, DC - all day
DC sucks
Dom’s a POS human being.
You can't have a argument with dom he tries to spin your words and trys to win.
I love joe but I literally think he’s the worst commentator, he’s so biased when commenting, I don’t see the problem with dc  he’s so insightful and breaks down fights well
"Im not dry, i add sodium and all that stuff"-cruz   Aye man you know salt dries stuff out right...
"Punch, punch." - Dominick Cruz
This guys are the best of the best!!!! a fan forever!
The only person missing here is RC, huh I meant Ariel.
naaah thats REAL GOOD content wow , like its real , plus dominick is actually about to fight. imo its tough to express how gold this was , who woulda thought these guys would do some golden recipe shit in terms of content creating
DC: you're dry Dom: I add so many things like sodium...   Dom is def the salty bastard lol  Love you all, even though you are all different as shit. Respect guys.
Cruz has always been a tad bit arrogant let’s be honest with a splash of narcissism. So of course he’s not guna get the point that something’s you just leave off air. Lol DC isn’t probably as prepared but he has good vision inside the cage. Dom is like the max killerman and goes by a lot of stats lol and yea he can be dry I agree.
Its saying alot when Bisping is the U.N.
It only took like 20 seconds for shit to get real lmao
I had no clue about any of this drama lol good content fr
It's not love Dominic. Why wouldn't you tell him that in private instead of embarrassing him in front of the world by trying to say he's crap at his job.
Love Dominick but this is the same guy who said Conor while being on bottom and getting pummeled by Khabib said he is trying to gas him out.
There are ways to go about this kinda stuff and DC is right. It's always the small guys who have issues lol
Solution is simple.  One entire PPV card with only DC commentary.  One PPV card with Dom commentary.  Let the audience decide.
5:36
Well Dom is right about doing homework but don't expose your friend in front of millions of people watching when the right thing a friend would do is tell him in private and act like whats wrong with that. DC handled it well, wouldn't call that a friend
No offense but DC is right on this one
Cruz has a touch
Good for them to talk it out rather than get all passive aggresssive about it…Both have a point because they are fighters AND commentators…Dom could have used a little more discretion about it but he is ‘keep in’ it realz’…tough one…
Dom is a grown 12 year old
3 trained killers in one room laughing their a** off, something is wrong here ! aha
Personally I prefer Cormier as commentator as then Cruz
These goofballs lmao.
lol dom saying media did DC wrong after he gave them the ammo to shoot lol keep ya mouth shut and tell DC how you feel in private like men lol
Cruz is just one of those guys that never ever will back down or admit he was wrong, its like talking to a wall. They say they are brothers but lets be real, DC will never look at Cruz the same way again.
DC is so soft. He couldnt respect Cruz's opinion. I guess we live in a world where we are supposed to blow smoke up each others butt's all the time and not say how we truly feel.
im not a fan of dom at the commentary booth he is dry lol guess he never heard himself.
Haha Dom is brilliant but he is a little dry. I love both of their commentating styles.
I was having a bit of a bad day and this fixed me right up.....man did I laugh.
Cruz tries to finesse his and defend his position and is denial of creating mistrust. DC will destroy this guy in the octagon.
Lol
The fact that Dominick is still prime trash talker. “When you hold your kid accountable, is it love” bruh, this guy kills me, and it’s so respectful! 😂😂
I think Dom is wrong here. It would be much different if Dom was specifically talking about someone else but he’s talking about how DC comments on him specifically? That’s just selfish and arrogant. He wants DC to say better things about him so he tells the world DC isn’t good At what he does and I think a lot of people think DC is a good commentator.
Ahhhhhhh
Dom's point would be far less salient if he didn't immediately get upset and then deny that he was "dry" ,when DC gave his honest opinion. And he is right. D bags personality is about as exciting as watching paint dry.
This is some brilliant marketing for DC's channel, intentional or not
Daniel Cormier... setting a poor example for his kids.  Take the feedback like a man.  Show up prepared.  Have respect for the game.
this is great TV
2:57 "When I heard you call my fight..." "What did I say wrong?" "Nothing, I don't listen to it I mute it" Wow, Cruz is such a snake.
Disgraceful behaviour from Cruz throwing his “best friend” under the bus. I hope he gets knocked the fuck out.
Cruz is butt hurt he didn’t fit in send him home
suck it up dom u were completely out of order
Send dom home. Hes boring as a fighter hes boring as a commentator.  Hes dry af
It's the CTE
Dominic 'Snake in the grass' Cruz
Joe rogan, DC and anik are the goat line up for calling fights. Dom is less than avg. commentator Bispings a good commentator also.
Showing the public what's behind the curtain when it makes your colleague look bad is treachery.  It's like talking about how unprepared a team mate is for certain fight techniques.... So the opposing camp can hear. Dominic, If you think DC is a c**t, tell him at the UFC Christmas party. Not in front of the world. Betrayal.
Cruz's attitude was wrong, but he seems to not understand that. It's not about your opinion about DC's work as commentator, but how you say and to whom. If he really is your friend, you have to call him out privately first. Calling out in public is something you do if he didn't listened your concerns previously, and I'm not pro of this action either, but at last stance I understand.   You can see that even if it seems DC is cool through the conversation, underside you can see that it hurted him more the fact that Cruz didn't comprehend his concerns about his action. Even with Bisping there, he didn't understand the point.   As a friend you callout in face to face. You put things clear in order to help your buddy be better. You don't do it in public, basically throwing him under de bus.  The worst feeling is when you don't see coming, and when it comes it arrives big.
Cruz being "Dry" is a huge understatement.
Dom sat there like a pupil that's been dragged in head office. DC the cool arse drama teacher that has to raise this dispute with him
Cruz is annoying
Cruz new tony showing some mental  problem .can’t blame this fighters.
Chael's video brought me here
Dominic should have been a lawyer.........splitting hairs.  Dude would have been a great litigator lol
Dominique Cruise is a very boring commentator, I’ve been thinking that for years. He’s not entertaining to listen to
Bisping sent me here
Bisping the worst analyst outta the 3 😂😂
Cruz looks like the dude who remembered the teacher to give us homework back in the days…
Cruz has read too many comment sections from his trash talk highlights that compliment how "clever", "cunning" and "witty" he is....He def not that smooth & its fairly obvious here whenever he's trying to manipulate, gaslight, play the victim, play dumb or persuade in any way. He ain't a pyscho genius, just a dick who happens to be smart.
I'm a huge Dom fan. I will be pulling for Munoz to discipline him.
@8:58 the look in Dominick Cruz' crazy eyes after he says "exact words" is hilarious
Dom while he can have his opinion should’ve privately went to DC because they are friends and now broadcasting teammates instead of going public. DC is honestly amazing with how patient he is at times with other people.
Dom is so boring 😴
Cruz doesn’t get it. Why try to fuck with someone’s money.
This is fucking awesome! Haha! I love them both.
Howd i miss this? Lmfao.
dom is out of line, even if he's right in his mind.
DC is right here and I'm a Cruz fan. You don't publicly sh*t on a colleague if he is a friend and teammate. If you have a criticism you do it privately,  do onto others...
Dominick Cruz is a bad friend
dom “he’s trying to gas khabib out” cruz
Oh. My. God. This. Is. Amazing.
Dom: I'm an analyst, I'm not here to be a comedian. That was actually very funny
D.C was Right
Dom is a dick for going public with it.....but hes speaking facts when it comes to DCs commentary. DC has started to build a negative reputation around many fighters and camps with his mediocre and biased commentary.
Cruz does an oxymoronic move without realising, "I mute" but I'm right in what allegations I made against u DC, Mr me right Cruz.
9:20 Dom thought he was with the boys lmaoo
this is absolutely hilarious!
Dominic's ears turned red 🤣🤣
Dude. This was beautiful content. Like this was real and not fabricated media crap.
Dominick did you dirty DC.  I give you credit for being more professional.  To be honest with you, I totally forgot that he commentates sometimes..  He's good, but he's not easy to remember.   He's more memorable as a fighter.  Maybe he just had a Cody moment where he has to go off the deep end to be noticed.  He needs to stop watching so many tapes and get his character in order.
commentary shouldn't be that much " entertaining"  i just wanna hear the fighters
Cruz ain't wrong... DC your commentary is pretty obvious you don't do your HW...
Dom “ Conor is trying to gas Khabib out”wtf Dom is the worst
This is pure GOLD !!!
Egos should be bruised only behind closed doors, if you hurt them in public they might turn into cancers.
DC you handled that situation like a true gent. Honestly, that was absolutely disgraceful to publically come out and say those things about you (and then to double down on them when you gave him the opportunity to apologise). The truth is you're the best MMA commentator in the history of the sport, but let's imagine you weren't. Even then a fellow colleague (never mind a friend) should never come out and publically say that you're essentially not doing your job. That's your livelihood. You never come between a man and the way he feeds his family. Honestly, it makes me wonder whether it's because he wants your job, whether he wants it to be him calling all the big PPVs. You keep doing you DC
I have always loved Dom the older I’ve gotten.
I love all 3 of these guys lol
Dominic “cigs and alcohol” Cruz shouldn’t be talking about fair criticism
We gotta make a COD lobby with these 2
i fuckin love both of you guys but DC is categorically right. mates private is private
They’re ultra competitive, even when it comes to who’s best at talking about competitions
I enjoy DC in small doses. The comedy isn't for me. I love Dom because he's straight to the point with his analysis. That's how I prefer to watch fights, otherwise I could go without commentary.
Oh this is a bit , a skit,  a good old fashioned comedy
Dominic "I'm not dry I add sodium and seasoning" Cruz
If all three of y’all came to Baton Rouge, I would buy you as much beer as you can drink
I just want these 3 to commentate on Saturday lol
Cruz takes himself way too serious. He thinks he knows everything that was unprofessional and wrong of him to do that I don’t get it
The best analyst in sports entertainment is me. Period.
DOM WAS ABSOLUTELY WRONG FOR SAYING THAT ITS WRONG PERIOD.
Yo that audio guy needed to boost the audio a bit no?
I mean i would very much rather listen to DC's commentating as he has so much personality and great chemistry with the other guys as opposed to the dry boring analysis of Cruz and zero chemistry with anyone else. Keep in mind this is the guy that was saying Conor was tiring Khabib by getting ground and pounded lol.
Fantastic
Cruz is so calm. DC, not so much.
It’s about time DC yes sir !
Coner is trying to gas khabib out ? This will stay in your resume for ever ‘ mr cruz
You can’t criticise your friends lack of professionalism on camera especially on the UFC😱 looks like DC gotta watch his job people Sneek-Dissing on him🤦🏻‍♂️ ... Personally that’s a bitch move on DCruz
I’d listen to daniel 10 times before 1 of Dominick’s. Dominick is good but is boring he only shows up says what’s happening makes his money dc enjoys his time makes fights entertaining Dominick couldn’t crack half as funny jokes as dc
it's good dom is honest but he shouldn't tell the public tell dc ..daniel already got in trouble for favoring fighters and got  pulled from a ufc event... its daniels living you dont mess with that
Cruz is that annoying weasel co-worker that'll throw you under the bus. 🤣
Nah DC is a bitch. Dom is alpha
Stick the microphone in there! Don't worry about the mic being seen on camera, we need the audio! Audio is paramount, above all else!
I’m dying
I had a researcher
If they're speakin about the knee-tap takedown against Casey Kenney, I thought DC actually called that on the money.
when bisping popped into frame, I lost it lolol.  these guys are a lot fun.
Cruz acting like a scolded child
These guys have found a completely different way to sell a fight ahhaha
This is so good 😂😂
This feels so fucking awkward lol
entertainment at its finest
Adesanya said on his channel that Dominik Cruz smoked a joint with him and went into a pre-fight meeting high
All this talk of preparations when none of you bother to take two minutes to learn how to pronounce fighter's names. 🙄🙄
I like Cruz but DC is hands down one of the best commentator. On the other hand, although I like him, Cruz does say some weird shit sometimes.
I will tell you why Dominick Cruz sucks at analysis.. When Conor was getting his face punched in by Khabib, he was telling he is making khabib tired🤣
I think DC is right about Dom doing it publicly and Dom is right about accountability being love. The moral of the story is just to do it in private. No need to give the media a story to run with that could potentially hurt a friendship. Much love to both guys. Huge fans of both 👊💯
I think DC is right in not acting that way towards a friend like that and kinda just being a douche about it. Everything dom was saying was just kinda douche baggy.
I hate Cruz even more after watching this interview.
😂😂😂
Love this.
truth hurts big guy
This is great tv
Wtf is this
What Cruz said in the first place was unwarranted and uncourteous. Even if he has a problem with DC’s commentary, he should’ve said it to DC privately. They’re friends and colleagues. It’s that simple
I love the fact that Dom is so dry he is hilarious 😂  pleaee never change Dom, tell em as it is!
Dom is such a sly talker. Both Bisping and DC say Dom's dry commentating style is not objectively bad - it's a subjective taste. At 8:10 Dom tries to say he's doing the same thing saying "I don't think you're bad either I just think you don't watch film" But what he actually means is "DC is okay on the whole but it's bad he doesn't watch film". Which is miles apart from what DC said about Dom. Dom even harps on and on about "holding DC accountable". As if he's calling him out for a scam.
DC shootin perfect from the field Bruh lmaooo this is also hilarious 😂
This guy Dominic is a bit of a slippery one. 🐍
5:24 "You don't need to defend if it's true."  What the fuck kind of argument is that. DC could say "Cruz lacks KO power" and that would be true..but if he said it in the context of "Is Cruz a good fighter?" Cruz would still defend it and argue you don't need KO power to win.
4:54 What a fucking argumentation trap by Cruz. Even if DC was baited to say a whole list of shit he just said one single thing. But that was all Dom needed to use his argument "I said 1 thing about you, now you said 1 thing about me". What a tactician.  (My opinion - the guy who STARTS the battle doesn't get to say "we're even, it's 1-1 now" when you hit back)  My personal opinion: huuuuuge difference between Cruz saying his negative feedback out of the blue, and this thing where he himself ORDERS Cormier to say something.
Dominic Cruz is that family member that always embarrasses you at Christmas and other holidays but never listens when you explain why it’s wrong.
OK, I absolutely like Cruz less after this ...
Dom was wrong
Bisping mediating is hilarious 😂
4:00 oof
Cruz's commentary is lame...... DC is much better!! Worry about not getting knocked out again , instead of being an ass clown! You are great DC!!...😎
3 of the best PISCES♓️ fighters ever!!!
Anik, Rogan & Dom would be my preferred line up for calling a fight.
DC is the f@#king MAN. I dispute all the critiques towards his commentary. Dominic Cruz is a pick and he 100% shit on DC with his comments.BUT he does add value to the commentary, they all do. I love that they bring something individual. ROGAN(excitment) ANIK(conductor) CRUZ(technical) FELDOR(balance) DC(experience/excitment) BISPING(entertainment) I love them all and don't actually care when they express bias towards their personal friends. I take that with a grain of salt. Easy
Dominick is lowkey a snake for not coming to DC before running his mouth to the media lol
Best Analyst in the biz…research or not.
Annoying little dude
0:28 there goes dom lmao, this is great.
I cant see dominick in a relationship except with his stupid dog. He thinks hes always right. Little shrimp.
Let me break this down in a nutshell.  Domanick struggles to hold accountability for his actions due to the to the fact he has a more than grandeur opinion of himself.  Dom struggles with accepting he is wrong, because he believes he's truly great. The truth is, his head is too far up his arse for him to ever consider himself to be incorrect or morally wrong in any given circumstance.  Dom is anything but humble and lacks an ounce of humility, he has no boundaries in what he says about others because he feels entitled to express his opinion based on his own self preserved level of importance and doesn't believe he can ever be incorrect.  Daniel, a person like you who's heart strong needs to be around more people like yourself, such as Khabib. You need to associate with people who're humble and appreciate you, people who're able to hold accountability for their actions and be more considerate with you in mind. People take your big heart and warm kindness as a weakness and they often don't show you enough appreciation because of this, and it sucks.  Keep your head held high Daniel and don't feel discouraged by what Dom said, you're more than just an all time great fighter, you're a fantastic commentator, and a fantastic person.
This is gana be great content right here I know it
Cruz needs to let people speak before using his ‘big words’ trying to outsmart people before they even get to their point.. other than that he’s a smart bloke but he used this tactic so much
DC I wish you was my big brother
Man Dom is giving me Ryan reynolds vibes here
I love DC, always keeps it real.  DC to Bisping: So let me ask you a question... TELL DOMINICK THATS WRONG XD
In this interview, Dom was indeed dry, literally and figuratively, due to the weight cut most likely.
I love watching fighters like this bicker. So knowledgable and impressive in the sport but at the end of the day if they went at it DCs weight alone would put Dom in a blender lmao
My man DC looking like the future super heavyweight champion
Cruz is hella sensitive
DC = more research Cruz=less dry. That‘s it right?
Don’t think Dom recognizes his place.
maybe a downside to cruz is how emotional he is, everytime he is facing adversity, like losing a fight he goes after the ref, weightcutting dc has to get it, he has littleman complex and gets so angry over little things
Dammit Dom, why can't u just take it easy a little, a praise to someone close to u, u can say it whatever u want whenever u want, but to criticize someone close to u and a college at the same work as u do, u cannot do it publicly like that, that's d same as dissing dc open in public bro.. That's rude.. Well maybe that's the way he is tough love u can say. DC is still the daddest in ufc the way he talk is very polite as always and also the way he's talk is nice to hear 👊🏻 respect.
DC is actually pissed and I don’t blame him
It's crazy that Dom doesn't see the point DC is making. You don't say those things publicly as a friend/partner. You never know what type of opportunity that negative talk could take away. DC might be under a microscope his next few fights now
3 hall of famers , this is the best thing ever
Love your channel and your commentary DC
Hahahah we all needed this in are life.thia was amazing
craziest thing about Dom saying DC doesn’t watch film….DC covers the film for Detail on ESPN+
This is a work; I love it but I'm not marking out for this shit.
I totally ENJOY DC's interviews.  I only started to take interest in mma because of DC's style.  Keep up the good work DC.
Dom Is always  a crybaby
That is bullshit dom
Cruz is so honest it’s brutal ahaha ! At least he doesn’t lie to your face. Can tell the man is a loyal person carries himself with a lot of  integrity
I can definitely picture DC not sitting through meetings lol . He’s a top of the head type guy, speaks his mind, makes some jokes and high fives , then when everything gets boring and serious he’s moving 😅 love the guy
I bet Dom doesn't have any friends lol we all have thoughts, doesn't mean we should say every thought that comes to mind.
I fux with Dom
Dom just wanted that Detail job.
He was asked about DC AND the others but Cruz kept going at DC. It's not what he said(even though it was unnecessary to answer that question at all). It's more about the fact he chose to only talk negatively about DC even though the dude asked twice about other people too.
Dominic Cruz is so immature and childish. I feel sorry for his wife, can’t imagine having a conflict with someone who is so up in the clouds
A bunch of veteran fighters discussing who is the best analyst. Hilarious
LOL
I think Cormier is right, if you have any friends they don't have to say bad things about you publicly ! They will say it privately, so you can make changes and be better.
the fact that dc put this out there is sick and a huge treat for us fans, thanks a lot  this video was pure comedy gold and we got to see a side of these fighters that we don’t see often when they’re together
Real and personable passionate guy's of a sport we all love. Keep up the great commentating! Always making the sport come to life with the emotions and accumulated knowledge from experiencing the fight game first hand. Makes the UFC experience come full circle . The clips shown of your reactions watching octagon side highlight reel type fight endings are priceless. Wouldn't be the same without you's. Great job champs!
Dom is way too straight and not sensitive for a fighter
0:26 feels good …shrugs*
I feel like Micheal Bisping is on Dominic Cruz’s side in the whole situation. But I personally think he should be in anyones side as being the “ mediator”.
Dominick Cruz is a manipulative man child I can only imagine how he treats women.
this whole thing was very entertaining. Dom being a bone, DC doesn't care about his job, Bisping is a hilarious lad. good work.
Dominick cruz is hilarious and i commend him for speaking his mind lol
We're at 100k DC let's go
Being a cameraman there must feel so cringe because they are slightly arguing
CO2 pyramid was stupid. And it make me look weird. Just plant some trees.
Was this after the pre fight conference were Cruz says he mutes DC when he commentates lmao
Yooooo
This whole video Dominick is throwing shade at Daniel’s commentary the beginning to 3:05, at the moment, this is where I’m up to right now .
What the hell is this? DC doesn't prepare for fight day,I actually heard that straight up from his mouth about a month ago or so in a show where there were about 6 people including him. They were making fun of him because he was the only one who didn't know anything about the new kid from Ireland,I can't remember his name. Come on DC just admit it. That being said, when you had that much experience,when you have been in the sport for so long as DC you don't really need to be watching films man,you knoe everything about all these fighters. I do however have to say that yes,you have a new talented fighter that everyone is talking about but you don't know anything about him the day before the fight,well that's a problem. Because now you need to spend time studying this guys while you should be preparing to call 20 flights the next day. Is not whether DC knows Dominick Cruz techniques, that's irrelevant,who gives a s...what your favorite technique is. But he needs to prepare and get familiar with every fighter because is disrespectful to them that youbare calling their fight and you don't know their story. Every fighter has a story behind them and it is good to let the viewers know what the story is,to get them even more interested in watching the fight. That's my opinion about this. Yes Dominick Cruz was wrong about saying these comments publicly, for sure. Yes they were the truth, but it was wrong,you don't put you coworker on the spot like that unless you want them to get in trouble,is that simple. But also this video makes DC looks bad because I happen to be a fan, and I have been following UFC for the longest time, and I can tell you sometimes I wish I could mute DC, even Joe Rogan and everyone talking because is nothing but crap they are talking about. Sometimes they mix friendship with work and it was so f.... obvious the last time when Chito Vera fought Franky Edgar, good lord that pisses me off so much because clearly you both wanted franky to win and it was disrespectful to Vera how you guys were calling this fight the whole time. That's all I have to say, let's see if DC deletes this comment lol
Dominic is such a CLOWN! Since the comment, he made when Khabib fought the chicken....This guy is really stupid!
Best video I’ve seen in a while because it’s real.  I’m glad Dominic called him out.  Didn’t DC refer to Stuart Scott as “ One of the most polarizing figures” he’d ever seen?  I thought that was weird
What happened before this?
Here's the deal. Fans have been complaining about DC's commentary for a while. So have fighters. Dom is kinda dry tho. Bisping won this argument.
"A person's steps are made secure by the Lord when they delight in his way. Though they trip up, they won’t be thrown down, because the Lord holds their hand." — Psalm 37:23-24
Dc I’m so happy you made the channel you changed my life i always wanted to be pro fighter but made allot of bad decisions but you over cable so much and inspired me to change so thanks for that
Okay lets be real.  DC doesn't put in the extra homework and does come off a little too relaxed in commentary.  And Cruz is an arrogant, obnoxious former champ who is struggling with the sport catching/passing him.
these two should be MMA's First Take
Cruz is type work colleague to stab you in a work meeting. But had coffee with ya that morning 🤣
DC is a nice man. Cruz is out of line...  Even if one takes a position that it was ok for him to say DC don't watch films, he's a d*ck for saying DC just wanted to get in, get out and make a quick buck...  Nobody needs friends like that.
DC comes off pretty bad here. Super thin skinned. Basically his complaint is, you're not wrong about the facts but it should have been kept secret. Thanks ridiculous.
Cruz thinks way to highly of himself ....To basically go public and say your co-worker doesn't do his job right is very unprofessional ....I have to use a phrase to Cruz from the old Bonnie&Clyde movie " What makes you so damn special"
DC needs better cameras and microphone for this videos. Also the angel needs to be better. Holding DC accountable but his commentary is great I disagree 100% of Dominic
what a great conversation. they're probably both right. DC could watch more film but Dom could have just tell him privately. wish there were more characters like those 3 in sports media.
In all seriousness Dominic is wrong here.  Whatever issue he has with DC should have been discussed privately.  Dominic dissing or trashing DC to the media breaks every man code or friendship between coworkers. To be it comes across as Dominic is pissed that DC gets paid more than him while he does less work than him. If I were DC I will watch what I see around Dominic from now on. If Dominic can say that about DC to the media imagine what he would say behind DC back where DC can't defend himself.  For everyone Dominic is the type of coworker you don't hangout with but just keep it all business while at work.
These two 🤦‍♂️😂
Lmfao when Don mimics Michael “I’ll pick ya up ya lit’l bastard and throw ya through the window” I choked on my laughing lmfaooo
I agree with cruz 100% champ I have to mute it sometimes or just listen in Spanish
Guys like Dom irritate me so bad. Like bro, have a heart for someone else especially your colleague. Doesn’t matter if the media didn’t note the positive stuff you said.. they fact you ratted DC out like that in the first place was unnecessary. Leave that to actual outsiders and fans watching. Not your own work partner bro. That’s real Dillashaw snake status material. And the fact he keeps biting back saying he’s not allowed to voice that stuff. 🤦🏼‍♂️ I know 8/10 guys in that situation would club their colleagues for making them look like an ass like that. Brother or not.
Cruz- “I think Connors trying to tire out khabib” Joe- “I disagree I think Connor has no choice and is getting mauled.” .....Cruz is by far the worst commentator in the ufc, dude has no right to criticize DC
I like all three and I am glad that they have their own unique styles in approaching commentary. With Cruz what I like as a viewer is that he will touch on the nuances and intricacies that most people will miss . Case in point Cung Le vs Rich Franklin...the majority of the announce team talked too much about Rich being the bigger and more powerful fighter...cruz however pointed at that rich drops his hands and sticks his head forward when throwing kicks ...fast forward to the fight and Rich did exactly that and Le spotted this tendency and knocked him out.  Much respect to all three of these legends!
They need their own sitcom
Daniel although he can be annoying I can't really say anything I dislike about him lol he's a funny passionate dude it's very hard to dislike him. Lol
Cruz is nobodies friend he just seems distrustful . Daniel seems far more loyal to his friends than Cruz.
6:17 lmfao
Arguing with Dom is like arguing with your girlfriend!
I only listen to Bisping.
Some has always been a strange weird guy. He is definitely a I’m always right type of guy.
DC>Cruz
It's called Gentleman's Agreement but Cruz wouldn't know anything about it He is just a blabber mouth
Dom is wrong for calling DC put publicly. As friends, there are things that you need to address in private and make sure that everything is sent across rather than calling someone in front of the whole world. Just do not burn your colleagues in front of everyone.
I believe Daniel is very good at breaking down a fight as it’s happening meaning he does not have to watch fights over and over again to understand what’s happening unlike Cruz who was very biased in the mcgregor khabib fight
This was fucking awesome
just couple of mate bantering each other
Cruz was wrong plain and simple. Constructive criticism should have been done privately. Publicly just makes it criticism, especially saying he mutes him, that’s just an insult. Cruz seems like a hard headed narcissist trying to defend and justify his actions without seeing DC’s perspective. Not cool.

Can’t take Cruz seriously remember when he said Connor is gasing khabib out 😂😂😂😂😂
lol
We all love dom but he was wrong this time for saying that in public
Dom i smart, but he is the kind of guy to think he is never wrong, everything he says is the right answer. He is a pure narcissist. What kind of "true" friend throws a brother under the bus publicly? DC all the way, prefer you more than the guy Cody humbled in the octagon.
Thanks for posting this and for the content so far, its been great! Salute champ! huge inspiration for me, thank you
Cruz has been immediately been removed from my favorite list of fighters because of this and I hope he reads this. This was just corny and feminine to do to someone you are supposedly "friends" with. Shoot the nigga a text man. Stop trying to make headlines being a girl.
LOL tbh i find cruz boring as fuck when it comes to calling fights DC brings excitement and makes the whole show a lot more engaging!
2 MAN JUST SAT TOGETHER AND TALK MAN TO MAN ON CAMERA BUT IF IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE RATHER THAN DC HE WOULD HAVE KICK CRUZ ASS ON CAMERA...YOU DONT TALK ON CAMERA ABOUT YOUR COLLEGUES THAT YOU DONT LIKE THEIR WORK ETC... ITS BAD
1 day ago yes!
Love Dom so much
Dominick" Yeah but its not my fault " Cruz
Dom is high IQ.
Brilliant. Truth is Dom is dry and Cormier forgets the name of the fighters he’s speaking to. No one’s perfect. Engaging shit regardless.
DRY DRY DRY - Respect but DRY
Jon ,Joe and Dc is the dream team when it comes to commentary
Dom needs to chill man. He seems to approach commentary like fighting. " NO! YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT YOU FEEL!" Not about your friend!!!!!!(or even colleague) in the public eye?!!. We get it Dom.... You're a good analyst, and a formerly great fighter that still fights. DC is a great commentator, analyst and an all round personality that was formerly Champ Champ (Heavy and Light heavy). And I always hear Dom correcting his fellow commentators on the job like he's "Holier than thou!" When it comes to DC, Dom needs to sit down bra!
Fantastic D.C. just fantastic.
Honestly i mute Dominick Cruz. Dnt get me wrong, great fighter but he seems like a bitch. He gives of this cocky impression like hes too good to smell his own shit. I think dominick is mad Cormier is a double champ. Daniel your good with me!! And you bring entertainment. Dnt worry they even want joe rogan gone but hes still here. Cruz acts like hes the guru of MMA. Like how do you do that. You couldve been a friend and been like hey you could watch more video. It will help your commentary. Cruz just wants his opinion to be correct. I hope he loses and then retires. Go Cornier!!!
My man dc is trending
Dc is right  Dom is dry  They shouldn't go to a place where everything or words is technical details....i mean they should explain it but in simple words and make it fun for everyone
Feedback is fine and all and often very helpful, but the money comment Dom made that DC is only there to make his money and leave was a low blow and I would end the friendship and keep it only professional going forward.   Daniel is right to be upset he was betrayed and on a public forum that should have been a private conversation 1st
Dom the 🐍🐍
Wtf  If you are friends with someone or colleague and have an issue go and tell him in person
Bisping telling it like it is, "Dominic that's wrong"
5:58 Bisping enters the chat
Lets not forget when Cruz said Conor was trying to gas khabib out by taking all that ground and pound 🤣
Gotta love Dominik Cruz
Dc should fuck him up
Everyone in the world more lumpsy then this flappy butt?
DC is trending on youtube.... fuck yea!!!
Dc... Dominick Cruz is not your friend
Cormier broke 100k subscribers because of this video. He should be thanking Dominic.
I always forget how much of a fucking killer DC was because he comes across so goofy and open about his emotions.
Cruz comes off standoffish but I get it he still believes he is still one of the bests in and out of the octagon but I don't think UFC sees it that way. When was the last time his was on PPV or at the commentary table ! Either way, he needs to just relax and do his thing
This was increidble and Cruz nailed it "now the media can't paint some dark picture" ... I see both sides. To be fair Cruz watches a ton of film but that doesn't mean you're calling the fights better reacting to what is happening. It just means you have anticipation and an advanced understanding of what guys might be trying to do. Cormier is excellent at reacting to what IS happening in the moment and describing what some guys are attempting in real time and he's spot on 90% of the time. I think all 3 ... former champions have turned out to be excellent commentators for the sport. Seriously 3 of the best and Felder is great as well. The sport is in good hands with these 3 very diff unique characters calling the action. I'd love to see them all have a podcast. They'd drive each other nuts but it would be money! lol
This is fake.
Dominic Cruz should not be considered as the friend as he proved
Wait isnt this the commentator that said conor is tiring khabib out by getting his face bashed? I think cruz didnt watch khabibs film of him doing that to basically every opponent he faced
Hey dc..!!! Could you please watch 14 packs @ Netflix ..? (All episodes please) You might have a different view on what people's are fighting for..!!! Thank you.
This is gold, hope its not a distraction for Cruz but this was great.
Dom thinks he's being real as a friend but he's wrong. I think he's delusional for thinking he's right and holding him accountable when it could have been done privately. DC knows who he is for sure after this.
Bad form Cruz. Digging a hole for yourself Man.
Cruz was way out of line and unprofessional.  People have been slapped for less.
Dominic Cruz is a worse commentator than Daniel 100% easy,, the man claimed that Conor was trying to tire khabib out by getting ground and pound smashed 🤦‍♂️
I hear what Dominick is saying. The way DC commentates on fights is like he doesn't know the fight history of either fighter he's commentating on. Counts people out a little early based on the moments. He can't really call out what to "look out for" or knows how they tend to do what they do. He is way too serious tho that was a LOW BLOW calling him out like that in the public eye. Could have been a conversation.
Man I love these guys
Cruz was definitely wrong for his comments. You don't throw your colleague under the bus like that.
DC got too comfortable in the booth, he talks like he's in a Dave and busters, Cruz just wasn't have it anymore
Ok give us money now please. Thanks.
DC is levels above Cruz who has mad himself look pretty stupid and very unprofessional
"this is part of Conors game plan, to tire Khabib out" - D Cruz. "I think he's just getting smashed" - J Rogan. That's the difference people.
Snake 🐍 in the grass
100k wheres my money DC ??
He is dry
Cruz is such a strange dude
Dc is right. Cruz went behind his back and sent shots for no reason. Friends say it to each other.
On here after watching Bisping. Lol 😆
Good friends.  They've already forged such a strong bond with each other that little stuff like this can come and go.  DC was probably right, though, with his main point that Dom's grievance with him should have been taken to him privately first; It could have been just like this without cameras.  Dom is right that he has the right to have an opinion and call people out on things when necessary, but again privately first and only later, if necessary, publicly.  In Dom's analogy with offering correction to one's child when they've done something wrong, that too is something that a parent would be better off doing privately rather than potentially embarrassing the kid in front of a group of strangers (or friends).  So basically, Dom may or may not be right about DC needing to watch more film to improve his commentary, but he was wrong to in a sense disrespect the friendship by not taking his grievance/"opinion" to DC first.  They'll all get over it.
Cruz can never ever have dagstani friend’s…  Loyalty is everything over there a
Yo DC..!!!
DC is a baby. He’s a horrible commentator.
I absolutely love all 3 of them, separately, and especially together!
Its the entertainment business so the commentators bring biases in to appeal to the public. As much as Dom says he doesn't, he sometimes does, one famous example is the Khabib v Conor fight where he said, Conor is allowing Khabib to punch him in the face to tire him out. That was one of the worst pieces of analysis I've ever heard, in any combat sports!
DC is 100% right who is he to be holding him accountable like his kid. He doesn't own the UFC. Sounds more like a little bit of jealousy. Lost some respect for Dominic. Dominic's commentary is a little bit dry and boring even though he's super technical. But the job is also to be entertaining. There's a balance of personality, respect and knowing the sport.
I’ve watched combat sports since the 80s and MMA since UFC 2. IMO they need a mix of great informative information on our sport and humour, the UFC in particular has this in abundance.  I like listening too all of them, it’s like watching an event with you’re mates.  Keep up the good work 👍🏻
DC got that Kevin James energy
07:07: Bisping like, “Damn. This is good… Hold up real quick…”
https://youtu.be/emBu6_HcqSA This is how bad Dominicks comentating is
DC is on alcohol & cigarettes while calling fights. Even conor said it.
Dc single leg scoop and slam!!!
Dom saying dc commentary is bad are you kidding me he should see how bad was his own commentary in Khabib vs McGregor
Make it dark, make it grim, make it tough, but then, for the love of God, tell a joke
Bruhhh why isnt conor getting up hahaha we mute doms commentary dc is in the right here why tf is dom going after his mate like this is dcs job who knows comments like doms could make dc lose work dc is wrong about dom being a fantastic commentator sure he has some great insight when he speaks about fights but fuck he just talks bullshit and its beyond hard to listen to
This is better than watchin most fights. Lmao! DC got told. Agree...maybe shouldn't have been public but perhaps this was something that had been brewin' for awhile.
It's is the same as I know I fucked up but ima defend this to the grave. Dominick is a weird guy. Just apologize and move on. I would be upset to if someone is asking with my pockets too.
DC watches wwe and is heavily influenced by it nobody else finds it odd this happened on DC's new youtube channel
Dom is just salty about the Hans Molenkamp situation and he’s being spiteful about the fact that you were posting pics after he “outed” the guy. Petty Dom hope he still does great this weekend
This visibly shoes how self-centered Dominick is. He completely disregards any "sportsmanship" and calls DC a friend while doing so. So absurd. DC had to walk away from that feeling empty for sure. It's like talking to a brick wall I feel.
Dominic is way to serious..
Dominick may be right but you don't say such things about a colleague in public. Tell him in private what you think and give him advice that may help him improve.
1331``1
13`133
`3311
If DC whines like this for 12 minutes ima just go ahead and see myself out. Cruz is unbearable. John Annik undisputed undefeated GOAT
All 3 are awesome at what they do
Hahahah this is good.
DC is a way more entertaining commentator than Dominic "he's trying to gas him out" Cruz. (While khabib is pounding McGregor)
Just found you via Michael Bispings channel, love your work DC, entertaining and informative
Dominick: Only pricks tell it how it is without regard for the other person's feelings.  Even if your opinion holds merit, criticism should never be made in public  among so "call friends/co-workers?", unless it's a joke between the two of you.  Every reasonable adult knows that "honesty is not the best policy" and while your are entitled to your opinion it takes "class" to know when and what needs to be said in any situation.  Now if you weren't friends, your stand in this interview makes  total sense, otherwise stop acting like a prick!  DC: Stop trying to befriend everyone.  It's hard to take you serious when you are trying to suck up to everyone.
Cruz got short man syndrome
Dominick Cruz calling out DC who is supposed to be a friend and team mate is a dickhead boner move.  I’d hate to work with a guy like that.  Super unnecessary.
Why is CRUZ fighting with angry bald whoopy
When you’re Hangry but gotta be in front of cameras.
Cruz is a legend for generating all these views for his boys DC and Bisping.
Dom is dry. so dry he makes a desert jealous
Cruz just seems to want a problem with everyone that isnt his biggest fan
Dom may be obnoxious, but he’s right here. Period.
All that and still didn't get to the bottom of it, and everyone but bisping walked away still heated 🤣😂😭☠
Why does dc consistently make a complete ass of himself, he said he was here to “check in” with cruz but he just tried to slam him on pointless and dumb shit cuz his dumbass ego gets hurt a little bit
That was entertaining lmao
Good shit fellas. The love is real
I think the UFC commentary team quality is @ an all Time HIGH! Love all these dudes and the camaraderie!
AHAHAHH so funny, Dom is savage. You know he's fuckign with him, it's his style of humour. They obviously enjoy the bickering even if DC was genuinely offended
Cruz was wrong for this.
Somebody call Washington...think we found new presidential candidates for 2024. They're even giving each other lessons on tact.
This is great. Turning a negative into a positive
OMG Dom is not really a friend and he cant admit he is wrong.
Man, that was awesome, and hell how much i also love Bisping, that was great to have him there aswell
D Cruz says connor gasses khabib by absorbing ground and pound punches to the face lol. Jokes aside put it aside dudes.
This was gold, you guys absolutely need a podcast.
Sounds like me and my brother.. arguing over some dumb shit lol
Bro u need bisping in every video
I can watch these fellas all day
Bro this guy dom feels himself way too much
DC making this happen BEFORE the fight is egregious
Cruz the most boring commentator ever. Not one laugh or enjoyment when listening to cruz
Dominic is immature. There is no professional arena outside fake wrestling where you go to the media first like a kardashian rather than go to your colleague and keep it there. Dominic isn't stupid. He knew exactly what the media would spin. If accountability is what you want then it has nothing g to do with the media. That's between you him and the company Dana white. DC should have tossed that little dude
Just bring up cruz saying mcgregor was tiring khabib out by allowing khabib to punch him in the face
Cruz is a straight up snake for that, complaining to the media about his own co-commentator who's currently still employed by the UFC. What he said was dirty too, basically saying DC doesn't know what he's talking about and is only there for the money, disrespectful. Cruz needs to realize that his commentary career will always be remembered by that crap he said in the biggest fight in MMA history where he said Conor was trying to gas out Khabib by getting absolutely smashed and mauled lmao embarrassing.
Cruz trying to take DC's ppv job with rogan and anik. What a snake. DC, drop this guy as a friend. DC, knock his job performance anytime you get a chance to make him look bad so he never gets your job.
DC don’t go down this road with Cruz he’s 2 good at debating
Who thinks Dom would've been pissed and publicly call out DC if DC said that about him?
Great great great conversation. It’s wild to me that Dom would say it’s not his fault that the media clipped and twisted his words around and left out the love and positive things he said about DC. “How’s that my fault?” It’s your fault Dom because you’re smart enough to know how the media operates. You’re a part-time analyst. You are the media. You know the game. DC’s point is don’t give the media the ammo to clip shit you say. Be careful with your words. Perfect example of Dave Chappelle’s, “when keepin it real goes wrong.” 🤷🏽‍♂️
No wonder Bisping always wants to hit him
I like when DC was talking to DC and DC didn’t listen to what DC had to say and he started talking over DC
He already said he watches film.  Amateurs Argue this way.  No specifics when DC asks a question and then doesn’t accept DC’s direct answer.  Dom is just mad DC is naturally without watching much film an infinitely better commentator.
Hahaha DC on the defensive…he is combative with his phrasing …don’t watch fights and forgets names hahaha
Jon Jones ruined DC’s career. Dom is insufferable but somehow DC is worse.
Bisping acting as a mediator is the living embodiment of throwing gas on a inferno
Cruz takes himself way too seriously for sure, even blaming the ref that time for smoking and drinking. You'd never hear Robbie Lawler speak that way, he'd simply accept the loss for what it was.
Lowkey Cruz was so two faced and petty doing what he did and you can tell DC was legit hurt.
Pulling up on Dom while he is cutting weight smh 🤦‍♂️
Dom is always gold in interviews this is classic
Wow this was so flipping interesting to watch.  Two colleagues having a difficult conversation, love it.  Don't know if this was planned but in the world of super fake this is what the internet is all about - raw and real.
Funny how he's criticizing DCs commentary when he did the absolute worst comentating in the Khabib and Conor fight. It was just awful.
Bisping is such a fun guy man. Brings the laughs and good vibes
Cruz won’t even accept his own losses… so why care about his dumb opinion
DC vs dc
Bisping might be the last person u would want to mediate any kind of verbal issues
Flying over everyone’s head when Bisping said “put me in the Middle East”😂😂😂😂
This sounds like a party argument...like there both lit af with too much testosterone lol fuuck so funny
Mannnn DC whatya doing to yourself. You knew what you were getting yourself into 🤣🤣
DC is so much better than Dominic Cruz! Even if Cruz does all his research his takes are not that good!  1.Joe 2 DC 3. Dominic.
Gotta love Dom saying he did nothing wrong.  Dom's gonna Dom.
Have Dom as a friend at ur own risk
Guys, you are in a unique position. You live your lives in public. Dom, you need to respect Daniels boundaries as a friend first...before his boundaries as collogues. Collogues come and go, brothers are forever. Daniel, you have to be very careful with what you say in public because you are held in such high esteem in the sport and have such a strong voice. But also, you need to back off a bit on Dom this week because he's got a fight and he needs to keep his energy in his headspace where and how he wants it. As men we each have our own ideas and expectations for what is considered public and private conversation and for the most part most men agree on this. However, you guys are in a very unique position with having the voices you have in the industry. You guys need to work out what you are comfortable and uncomfortable with and come to an agreement before having these conversations on camera. That being said this was extremely entertaining! If this was a work then you totally got me and all three of you deserve awards! Guys, remember your relationships are completely unique and not normal. You are going to have to talk off camera about what you feel comfortable with and work something out you can all live with. Love listening and watching you guys work!
Dom definitely was completely out of pocket doing that. Such a sneaky sly move, for someone who claims to be a friend and loving colleague. Sneaky like a snake.
DC IS right. This is y i dont let anything statement against me go. U say something that isn't right about me, I clear u there and then 4 u not to have wrong impressions
Gold
Dom knows how to gas light
This was some good content!
very interesting video. dominic comes off like a jerk though
Dominick Cruz wants to fight DC doesn't he?
Dom is a very sincere guy and cause of that people like him always find some type of backlash or trouble. Hypocrites don't have that problem whatsoever.
DC is such a douchebag. Can't take any critics and always as sore loser since he was fighting Jones. Respect to Cruz, straight shooter.
Subbed
dom: tell me something you don’t like about me dc:ur dry also dom: mad over being called dry even known he literally asked him😂🤦🏼‍♂️  love all 3 of you tho
DC is crushing it with commentary and Cruz is jealous. That’s it.
Say what you want about cruz he doesn’t give a fuck about a confrontation
I used to love Cruz but he’s totally in his own head! DC may not study all the fighters like anik but he knows twice as much about fighting as anik and Rogan combined
Napoleon complex cruz.
This video is gonna hit Millions views!
Cruz makes me dislike him more and more everytime I see him. Hopefully him and Cormier dont call fights anymore after this and add big yawn mccarthy to that list too. UFC DESPERATELY NEEDS NEW PLAY BY PLAY AND COLOUR COMMENTARY
Some opinions you dont have to say out loud though. If you buddy married an ugly wife would you go tell reporters “i think his wife is ugly”?
This is the video I didn’t know I needed
Accountability is Love DC ❤
Dominick Cruiz is having an argument only for the sake of winning the argument. It’s a waste of time for DC to even go back and forth with him.   DC is great at what he does and makes it entertaining to watch was well. Of course Cruiz is dry, just compare his ratings with DC
Dominick looks like he's on weed. Maybe it's the weight cut.
Ah, just real, honest tv. Love everything about this.
Podcast dream team tbh
Dom problem is how DC calls dom's fights, his feelings are hurt
Dom seems like the kind of guy who hates fighting now but has no choice in the matter.
The DC ambush of DC
Bisping is great lmao
Dom is definitely an asshole. The way he can't understand that some things shouldn't be said in public when you're friends is crazy. He can say there's some things dc can work on but no need to be so frank about it.
Secretly, like all of us, DC wants Cruz to get KTFO!!
Damn, Dom destroyed Cormier!! 😂😂😂
Dude really said “how you call fights is how I make that determination” then said “i don’t hear you call fights” in a matter of minutes. Lol Cruz is trying to win an argument not actually be a good commentator.
Cruz is the same person who said Conor was making khabib tired by letting him beat on him
I can’t stand Cruz. He seems like such a douch
DC is correct
I love seeing friends argue with civility, this was so funny and both are obviously right.
This is going to boil over in a weird way later. I feel it
DC cornered cruz & treated him like the emotional & unprofessional co-worker that he is. The more cruz tries to lie so miserably? the more obvious he is on attempting not to lie. At the end of the day whether he wants to admit his faults or not? DC does not need cruz to admit anything because he exposed him here.
1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  Except you REPENT you will ALL likewise perish - Jesus Christ, (Luke 13:3)
Bisping: "I don't think there's a wrong or right answer here"  Dom: "Yeah, it's a mixture of everything"
STORY TIME!!!! While I was a server in a fine dining restaurant at Disneyland, DANIEL Cormier came in with his family for a meal… he was SO RUDE and fat. I’ll never forget the experience. His kids were also HORRIBLE. Obviously DC is a trash father because their behavior was atrocious. Throwing food, crayons on 10k dollar tables, DC actually left a dirty diaper under his table…. Seriously can’t stand this guy and I’m going to blast him on every video he puts up telling this story.   Call me a liar DC. You and your family are trash. This is based on personal interaction.   OH and YES he was intoxicated throughout the entire service. You could smell the booze coming off him while his face was buried in his phone.
Both have good points, but I kind of agree with DC.
" I mute it when DC commentates" I am a Cruz fan but of course you don't say something like that. Reminds me of Charles Barkely saying Michael Jordan was a terrible NBA owner yeah you can say honesty this or that. In the real world if yoh want to keep a friend or friendly working relationship you don't say shit like that publicly period.
Very wholesome, DC is on thin ice tho 😂
Like a old married couple
They sort of canceled each other out here. What I mean is, accountability is done in private, not in public. With that said, Cruz violated that by criticizing his friend and colleague in public. He tried to justify it by saying that he can criticize DC publicly because he’s done it in private, but in my opinion that argument doesn’t hold up. If he’s already telling DC this in person, then he’s fulfilled his desire to hold DC accountable. There’s no reason to make it public because he’s already voiced his criticism to DC in private. Any further accountability that is needed can continue to be done in private, it doesn’t become more effective now that he’s done it in public. In fact, it’s less effective now because DC is less inclined to listen to anything that Cruz has to say. However, on the flipside, DC sort of canceled out what Cruz did by publicly pushing back on his YouTube channel. If DC wanted to stay consistent with what he was upset about, he should have pushed back on Cruz’s criticism in private as well, both to voice his concerns, but also to prove his point that criticism of a colleague and friend should be done in private. By going public with his disagreement with Cruz he’s pretty much doing the same thing he was upset with Cruz about. Anyways, it looks like there’s no beef and I’m sure Cruz will come back at some point and apologize but just giving my two cents.
I never liked Dominic Cruz  comentate. best duo is DC and Rogan !
😂😂
Karen Cruz
Druz is being a jerk, but what he said isn't wrong.
if i was cormier i'd stay away from cruz. we work together when we have to and that's it. i  wouldn't be rude to him but i'd leave that guy alone.  cruz could have pulled dc aside and said listen i don't like the way you are calling my fights and i feel that you are disrespecting me. you don't watch film you are not prepared and if you do that again i'm going to call you out on it. cruz is mad about something in his life and he is taking that out on dc.
This was amazing TV.
🔥😂
Forget about Max vs DC for daddest man on the planet. It's all about Daniel vs Dom for baddest DC on the mic.
Dom you did say DC is bad. Hahaha.
that’s how pisces showing love to each other 😅😅😅
Dominick "throw a mudderfucker under the bus" Cruz. He's salty because he doesn't get referred to as DC even tho he has the same initials. 😂😂  This guy would rat out his own mother or turn informant if he got pinched in a pickle on the streets. He's certainly not my favorite character. He seems so self absorbed . I prefer DC and Bisping commentary over his.  He's a weasel and gets the bronze if in competition between the 3 honestly. In terms of commentary and fighting lol
All respect to Dom as a fighter.  Regardless of whether he is right or wrong about DC’s prep, he generally comes off as a jerk.
I’m sorry, but dom isn’t making any sense. I like Cruz and DC, but bro come on man. You don’t talk shit about people publicly, saying DC doesn’t watch film? Like come on bro, he doesn’t have to watch film like you to watch film. He just comes off as arrogant, and has convinced himself he’s the best commentator out there.
Dom sounds like suuuuch a prick. Not the type of guy I would get along with
Have to admit that being on the prelims has to have Dom on edge!!!!
I like the realness of this video and Bisping was just the cherry on top!  To be real though, Cruz should have never said that to the media, only off-air and to Daniel's face.  Was a low blow by Dom and he owes Daniel an apology and very expensive dinner.  Even if it's true, not right to go that route, very unfair and unprofessional.  VERY SALTY DOM!
Dominick was wrong here… that was foul.
I'm pretty sure even Cruz's family thinks he's a jerk.
im 1 minute in wtf is happening
Cormier is a better commentator in my opinion
Dominick throwing mad dirt on DC WTFF
I laughed so much. Just what I needed. Thanks Fam. Dom is just being Dom. He wants to best out of his friends. He has a great MMA mind and is a super sharp analyst. DC brings his own perspective and I like it to.
Dom was trying to has DC out.
So happy seeing Cruz shitting on DC for his lackluster commentary
I think Dom’s heart rate went up… what kind of friend is DC
this was his most entertaining video
I like dominic but I think he's drinking his own kool-aid a bit here. Let all that "best commentator in the ufc" talk get to his head lol
Now I get why people are frustrated with me, because I'm very similar to Cruz, the way I argue people, and the way I am, generally...yeah, I get why I rub people the wrong way, but its not wrong.
DC you da man!! 👊
Cruz gaslighting DC harddddd😂
If he says in public what you say in private he is a lil female. He is a gossiper and does not have a man of word. You don’t do that to another man
100000 subs C'mon Champ show me the money 👊
There Bros media jusss fucked on them to be honest
Cruz is wrong. Blatantly wrong. He was rude and disrespectful to DC doing that in public!. That conversation is private.
This is one of the best videos I've ever seen. A perfect display of honesty and comeadery amongst honorable men 🙌🙌🙌
i loved this. this felt refreshing. you three should waste more time talking shit
Dominic Cruz has been taking too much estrogen 😋
DC sucks.
DC is 100% correct you can't just say anything in public about your friends... He been wanting to say that he could've told him man to man that looked weak
Mike coming is was too funny
Cruz is a master of smack talk but he's not as good of a commentator is Daniel Cormier by a mile!
People are taking this way too seriously
DC “Wanna talk? Let’s talk” Smash smash smash
DC! You have been a bit off. Tho ur better then juice head jon jones.
Not kool
FINALLY SOME REAL TALK TEAL SHIT
DC shoulda been honest Cruz is dry he boring and a dork for sure and obviously a hater of course and when callin a fight ur callinbthe fight at hand not past fights my dude and dunny how DC str8 told him how he sets up the knee grab Dominick ur a fool and only a person would take a shot at someone cause they are envious of that person.
Well that’ll boost YouTube for him
I love this DC, so real and candid. Keep it coming.
cruz argues with everyone.. hes that friend you always have to either calm them down or tell them to shut up and they still wont. hes the one that will sneek to the mall with and if he doesnt get a girl he will go tell your mom you went to the mall.. lol
Ecclesiasticus 20:13-14 A wise man by his words maketh him beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out. The gift of a fool shall do thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the envious for his necessity: for he looketh to receive many things for one.
DC vs DC lol
DC vs DC lol
I like domick Cruz better than Daniel commentating
100% agree with DC. No need to bury a colleague like that. I love Dom, but i think he equates good commentary to detailed analysis. That is only one component. Another part is the charisma and energy which DC has in spades.
Gained an entirely new respect for Dom, he's even more of a legend than I thought.
Dominick Cruz is the most annoying guy ever. “Conor is trying to gas khabib out ” who is he to talk shit about DCs commentary.
Dom is too arrogant to apologize for publicly airing what should've been said privately
Cruz doesn’t have that men code
He said “so when you hold your kid accountable for something” lmaoo DC getting soned😂😂
Luv cruz but DC  is def good an know how to call fights’    .   i understand what Domz sayn like he moves this way to set up this but  come on bruh  Joe Rogan dont do that an he wayyy better then Dom
I recall when cruz didn't do the homework and was all wrong about khabib and Conor fight!!
Dom it’s not a rule brother ?! It’s respect ✊ now shut your weasel mouth .dc would crush you
Love you DC you keep it real!!
Imagine cruz gets knocked out by trying to gas out his opponent by taking punches to the face. That would be  crazy
I’m surprised Dana let him post this on his own page
It’s like mom came home and saw her 3 sons arguing and she sent all 3 of them to timeout. 😂🤣
I like DC, I’m beginning to not like Cruz since he attacked Keith Peterson.
DC is awesome.  Dude cracks me up.
Daniel is extremely right.  Cruz was wrong to say those things plain and simple.
Dominic definitely thinks he is smarter than he actually is, very annoying 🙄
“Who made that rule?”  That line there said a LOT about the type of guy Dominic is. If you’ll cross a friend and then say some sh*t like that in your defense, you’re a straight up snake in my book.
DC I think Cruz is saying that you should watch more movies and eat more chicken.
1. Glad you had this interaction. 2. Thankful for letting us listen in. 3. Cruz was dead wrong for what he did. He's not wrong for saying it, that's love, he's wrong for saying it publicly.
Ah DC I used to love you, but you’re so fake… Just be yourself. Crackhead Jones was right
Dry as chalk.
DC is trying to gas Cruz out with all that watching fight questions
I'm only a minute in and I'm dying
"So I'm wrong???"  Yes jackass.  Stop being so disrespectful.
Ghost writer really? Lost all the respect dc
U admitted to having a ghost writer wtf
wholesome
Cruz is not as smart or important as he thinks he is.  Drop this "friend."
Dc handled this beautifully
I didn't know I needed Cruz and DC arguing with Bisbing playing the mediator until it happened
Yikes Dominick Cruz seems like a nightmare to be in relationship with.
Didn't Dom say Conor was trying to gas out Khabib by getting ground and pounded lmao
Cruz not remotely out of character - the type of guy he is throws "friends" under the bus... Glad D.C. gave us a chance to dissect Cruz on oir own by watching- body language , response to  D.C. suggesting it wrong to throw a "friend" under the bus said it all..
Dom is wrong for that. You don't publicly say things that could cost your co-worker his job. Especially if there is a relationship there. He could've joked about many different things but job performance is totally out of line for a bro.
Dominic giving DC all this extra attention to this channel. DC should be grateful!
Priceless! God I love Bisping! Also I rather listen to Dc over Dom any Day. He makes it fun and light hearted while watching people get smashed!
Dominick Cruz is not a man I'd hang out with he's a little victim with an attitude problem and he argues like a woman, lol but Daniel Cormier and Bisping are 2 good old boys you that would likely make awesome friends !!! I wish Bisping had dropped him!! lol
I love how Daniel always has to constantly touch whoever he is talking too lmao
Give these three a weekly podcast
Somebody get Dom some water.
I honestly feel that Dominic Cruz has absolutely no friends…
Cruz is in the wrong. His opinion may be right. But it's obviously a mean thing to say to the public and makes Cormier look poor at his job.   I wonder if he has Asperger's or something.
Dominick "Jon Jones" Cruz
2:21-3:03 Sums this up perfectly. Dominick is just insecure and wants people to speak more highly of him.
Cruz fails to understand the whole point is to entertain the audience. For me personally DC strikes a good balance of analytical and fun. For the majority of the audience is probably better than a cut and dry nitty gritty style like Cruz. He’s a brilliant MMA mind but lacks flare. Just like some fighters with less stellar records sell way more tickets than the guys with the best records. It’s all entertainment.
Dom is annoying as fuck calling fights lol I know he's knowledgeable but what he adds sucks.
Cruz: “Do you watch film?” DC: “Yes, I do watch film!” Cruz: “How many of my fights have you watched?” DC: “I’ve called your last 2 fights!” Cruz: “That’s not the same.”  Dominick Cruz is so insecure it’s insane
THEY DID MY DUDE DC DIRTY LOLOL
This made me dislike Dominic Cruz a lot. DC should have brought up "Conor is trying to gas Khabib out" by eating ground and pound punches to the face and liver
Get a room, guys
😂😂 fucking love it.
Cruz even wasting energy on such menial argument shows he’s lost the championship edge. Focus is just elsewhere. On decline.
Has Cruz talked about the fact that he is on the autism or asperger spectrum? Its very obvious when you see how he acts in social situations. He's like a more intelligent Rockhold in that way
Dom might be right but damn if he ain't a stubborn sumbitch  Dom vs Monster Energy, let's go
Dominick Cruz was so childish and rude to his “friend” in the media of all places . So what if he watches film . I’m no longer a fan of him .
Meanwhile I’m here saying Mike Goldberg is better than all of them.
DC #7 on trending hot damn my man!
CRUZ WITH VERY EFFECTIVE "NEVER TOLD, NEVER FOLD" INTERVIEW STRATEGY.
Tbh tho I would probably pay somebody myself to sit and watch hours of film. Mad time consuming! Although I do see the value in it as an analyst.   Regardless DC is a legend and so is Cruz. I’d be pissed at Cruz too if he exposed that to the media tho lol.
DC about to cry
I hate dominicks combative and conflict seeking attitude.  He does the same shit on the air it’s sooo annoying.  Always correcting or stating his little jabs here and there.  He’s a smug ass
Dom is a good analyst but he said one of the dumbest statements of all time. He tried saying conor is looking good by taking a brutal beating from khabib cuz khabib is gonna get tired. Conor so the one with the cardio issue too. Dom couldn’t have been more wrong that was ridiculous
Great Content!
This fight deserves a $50k performance bonus
Don’t mind me 🤗🍿
Huge fan of you three, but that was wrong on Dom.
Dom is such a cry baby drama queen damn
this was good from the start 🔥
Honestly I love DCs commentary, Cruz is just being cocky, keep up the great work champ!!
We love you both but DC do your home work no more excuses you all are doing great
Dom Cruz playing dumb he knows saying dc is only there for the paycheck was too much even if he’s right dc is supposed to be ur friend cmon
I could watch this shit ebrryday. They need a damn show
Dom is such a narcissist. He wants everyone to call fights the way he does and do everything the way he does because he's the best. GTFO There's a unwritten law with your friends. You don't throw them under the bus ESPECIALLY at their workplace.
Dominick Cruz wants DC spot  when Joe Rogan leaves.
I give Dom credit as fighter, however personally wise and as a commentator he is grating. Maybe that is why he is on the prelims.
DC is a killer with a fun personality while DC is way too serious and boring. I'm on DC's side.
I’m subscribing thanks the middleweight champ MICHAEL THE COUNT BISPING!!!
DC can't take criticism
This is awesome
D.C had a point though..
Cruz is so defensive.
Max Holloway already said DC commentary was shit. Why is he upset?
Honestly, I can't stand to listen to Dominic Cruz when he's commentating... something about his delivery just rubs me the wrong way. I think he's obviously very knowledgeable and informative, but I just really can't listen to him during fights.
So this is why Dom hasn't been commentating for a while...
I never liked Daniel Cormier.  I see him as an American sell out.  He cried a lot especially against Jon Jones,  people never really liked him until he was made a victim.  He hypes Dagestani and Russian fighters over American as an American. You don't see that the other way around.  He was drunk after a commentary ufc event and wants anyone to force his opinion.  He still demonizes Jon Jones. Many fighters have said that they are mad at DC
They're both bad commentators
Cruz takes himself way too seriously. Could be the weight cut making him come off this bad.
I smell a backstabbing snitch when i see one. I was hoping DC would body slam that skinny fook.
Damn I love this
Just another reason why this community is that much better than boxing.  This was some family shit right here. Some real shit.😆✊
What does DC holding his kids accountable have to do with you?? Is DC your kid? Does DC blast his kids on camera?? DC, you are way too civil and fair. Just sit on him and make him stfu. He's so effing annoying.
I'm a casual Joe Fan and I have literally seen every fight the ufc has put on from early prelims to the main event for the past 25 years or more and so I totally believe Daneil Cormier being in the sport has seen more film than me.
DC²
AWWWWW, Isn't that cute,😇
DC is lazy
Daniel "biased commentary" Cormier.
Dom sounds like colby Covington in this interview
Love both guys. Props for being respectful to both goats. 🙏🏻🔥
Where is the respect for DC holy.... Cruz is out of his lane
Team DC
Let’s be honest.... DC can be great but he can also show a lot of bias
Dominick  ick for prick lol
Dom cruz is a legend but damn he has such an unlikable personality, like a narcissistic type that needs to be right all the time, like chill tf out already.
Idc I love both of these guys
Lol I love it. Yes... As good as Dom is a commentator, he can be a bit dry. BUT he should be allowed to say his opinion on other commentators. BUTTT I personally would never throw another colleague or friend under the bus like he did. xD
I seen all of it. The parts where Dom said he loves DC etc. On a video from an MMA media outlet. Blaming the media like bums like Josh Thompson. Pathetic.
DC > Dom commentating
Dude wether cruz is right or wrong(i think hes kinda right) the day DC doesnt try to be the bigger man i feel sorry for whoever steps on his toes because he really is the BIGGER man
Dom was wrong, just because DC doesn’t explain how he prepares doesn’t mean he doesn’t watch footage. And as a friend, he should have not spoken his name in vein. Also Dominick Cruz’s commentary is dry
Agree with Dom here. Goes hand in hand with some of the biased commentary and not showing enough respect to the less well known fighters, by not giving them their due as a commentator.
I always thought DC, Bisping & Joe were the best commentators Dominic is good but kind of boring in his approach
Dominick Cruz is so dry and what he said about DC is exactly the way myself and a lot of my friends thing about Dominic. He will literally try to explain every single little detail to the point where by the time he finishes explaining one move the end of the round will come. And I'm not talking down about him he can be however he wants to be but it shows how he will talk smack about DC's commentary and think it's the truth but can't take it when everybody elses  truth is said about himself.  DC makes the fights more enjoyable he commentates more like a non fighter and how most of us think, where as Dominic talks like he is a coach trying to learn everybody. Almost as if he is a narcissist and he wants people to believe he knows everything LOL just my opinion.
You could feel the tension in the first 30 seconds 😂😂
I love how innocent minded Cruz is, but DC is right! I hate to say it because I like Cruz more as fighter and an annalist.
I love what you're doing brother! You have such wholesome chemistry with buddies. You got to convince Dom and Bisping to at least do one podcast with you for your channel. What you have is special. This captures something unique that a regular broadcast can’t. Guys chilling, keepin it real, talking MMA, and busting balls.
Cruz is the Bret Hart of MMA. One of the greats. Serious about his business.
This is what happens when you get rid of mike goldberg lol.
That was the best!   Hilarious!
Perfect way to have a debate/conversation with a difference of opinions. DC you the man.. Dom did well to ensure this was on discussed as DC didn’t want to get into it at the beginning haha
betcha DC starts watching film
'I do appreciate you as an analyst'  '... whom i mute.'
This is gold
Dont criticize your coworkers in public, especially if it's something you can tell them in private.
DC chair is screaming
I like Cruz, never miss his fights but mang he be sounding like a baby 😂
Don't worry DC, Pedro will punch Dom in the mouth for you this Saturday.
Cruz not a good friend.
When Cruz asked "which of my fights have you watched in preparation?" DC should have been like "Acually, I've been studying your fight with Cody Garbrandt"
Dom is actually hilarious
Looked like DC was sitting in a kids chair! 🪑👀
plus I want fight pass to put up film sooner
Three Pisces talking shit... confusion!
Don't cut gold short DC let it run brother. You guys in your friendly element is great!
I am more on Dominic's side
Lol it's fake. Promoting Dom's fight and DCs YouTube Channel.
DC >>>
Cruz should just apologize. This might hurt Dominic's career because no one will want to work with him.
That’s not friend or a brother behavior!
Bisping DC and Cruz need to be a commentary team for a fight night now
If I was a chair, I'd definitely want to be the one on the right... Less pressure
These 3 are gems
It was wrong of Dom to say that publicly but man.. Dc that was wrong of you to bring this up now before his fight. Especially after Dom’s been saying all week that he’s trying to keep his HR down and doesn’t want any added stress. Time and a place my guy.
I love these guys!! DC is my guy .. I like how he handled it.... but I also like how Dom stayed true and held firm behind his words
Cruz to DC I don't think you're bad I just mute it lol
Cruz is such a D-Bag. Awful personality and he is by far the worst commentator. Good analyst but he is so boring and dry it's like listening to a funeral procession.
To be fair, were getting a heightened, weight cutting, pre fight Cruz.
I wouldn't want to have Cruz as a friend. Hope he gets knock the fuck out this weekend
At 3:55 it seemed like i was watching a scene out of a movie
I really enjoy DC and don't particularly care for Cruz but I gotta agree with Cruz. DC is a goofball and not the professional Cruz is
Bisping would be a scary ref...
Dc. Should've shot on him and made him say uncle.
DC speaks facts to Dom like the older jokey jock with wisdom speaking to his buddy who takes himself too seriously. Anyone that's been in a locker room can appreciate this conversation between these three killer athletes
I wanted to see Dominick take down dc
Dominic is undermining DC here professionally. Very mean spirited and I wonder if he wants DCs shifts. Consciously or unconsciously 🧐
Your knowledge of mma and wrestling has educated me many times. This is silly nonsense. Let it slide and move on. Dom is salty as hell nearly always lol.
You should totally eat peanut brittle with your mouth open, the entire Cruz fight.
Dom is old and washed. Hang up the gloves man
someone tell cruz how he commentate khabib vs conor and how ill educated he seemed.
Dom’s calling of Conor vs khabib was beyond bad
I like Dom. Very clever bloke with a take no prisoner attitude.
Just watch the bjj scout breakdown....
DC was really out here with a ghost watcher for his tapes 😂
I really think hes just trying to gas him out until the later rounds
Dom is unbearable, the guy is too literal with everything
Can Somebody Please get MICHAEL BISPING A Gangster Belt PLEASE!!  The REAL BFM 💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
You talk over him the whole time, it's annoying.
Dom is dry. He should lighten up.. lol
I love how Daniel touches him as to say , I will fuck you up!
Dom has no emotions in his commentary people can get rocked, hurt, back and forth banger fight, and he would still have that monotone boring commentary
Damn?! Defensive Dom!!
I am not a big fan of doms commentary
I hope when Cruz gets slept in next fight, DC will be  giving him some critical comments I hopehe takes it as love🙄🙄
Our osteology video has been released! We wish you a good time. https://youtu.be/Kw5_Mu1LneM
simply excellent
Woo, love Daniel just getting to the point #respect ✌️
Hey
What is this the WWE? Shit is hilarious tho
This is all fake hype for his fight and for the both of them. All fake..
Someone on Twitter commented how DC always is half way outta the cage with his back to the camera when he says the fighters name. I totally agree. It comes off as lazy and disrespectful. That's my main complaint other than his bias does show now and then.
This is SO spicy
I can't believe no one called Dom's commentary style 'No Nonsense' just get a jab in.
Loved this. More stuff like this
This is the content we needed!!!
What a great trio the guys are! LOL
this was SOOOOOO entertaining. I love these guys. Smartest in the business .... which is why they are the analysts that they are.
This was unbelievable. Absolutely amazing to watch. People don't need to go overboard & hate on anyone. Just 2 buddies who don't see eye to eye on something.
when Dominick sat forward I thought Dc was gonna shoot for a takedown.
What a mess over mess, sounds like Dom is just being sensitive.
This is the greatest mma content ever 🤣🤣🤣
ohhhh shit this was awesome, cruz is really bitter about a ton of shit  that regular folks can really sympathize with , the funny guy getting all the opportunities , dedication going unnoticed.....regular corporate American bullshit.....but he fails to understand that not everyone brings the same to the table , daniel is by far the closest replacement to Rogan because of the image he created as a champion. his commentary is great...but second to that.
Espn would never let this run. Thanks for DC having a YouTube page
Bruh DC I would tell dom he’s acting out for attention like the Keith situation again
Someone should hold Dom accountable for being a bad friend and colleague. DC is a better man than me. DC held his cool. F#ck Dom
Pure gold.  These three perfect together
To be honest Dom is in the wrong, if he had a problem with DC and his analyst style he should have approached him face to face instead of criticizing DC infront of the press who feeds off of drama, Dom seems bitter and entitled towards DC, i have heard them both and if its true that Dc may not take notes etc it shows that he is simply more talented because after Rogan its only Dc that id prefer to hear. There's a time and place for everything and if he truly considered Dc a broski he would've talked to him like Dc did here with or without the cameras!!!
Dom is angry. Friends don't say that stuff in public! I wouldn't want to be his friend.
Dry😂😂😂
DC said it best. I can believe easily that Dom is a great guy, but he is really dry. It’s good to be bold sometimes but if you have no reason … you’re dry.
dominic is the worst commentator in ufc history
i would a million times over rather have dc call fights than dominick cruz
The desired out come is Dominic Cruz to take DC's commentator seat. With such friends you don't need enemies
All 3 of these guys >>> Toe Brogan   ANY day of the week...all day every day. I will take 5 simultaneous Mike Goldbergs over Toe Brogan.
Dom said let's talk. He knows where this is going. Dom is slick with words
Thank you bisping 🤣🤣🤣 and Dom is dry like Sahara 😅😅
This is like the nerdy musical kid mad that the football player is the lead simply because he is more talented and that’s hard to swallow
dc as a commentator id levels above dom tbf
Best honest interview ever! Accountability is love. Dc got that victim mentality over this.. I still love having dc as an analyst and I love Doms honesty.
DC just underhook him
Ok now I get why Dominic is single.
Dom is definitely wrong. And Dom is not very good. Especially when he said the REASON Conor was getting smashed by Khabib was because Conor was trying to tire out Khabib
Great trio
Loved it! This was the best 🤣
This is too funny. Lol
The term for Dom is loose cannon.  They all rep the UFC and answer to that machine.  This sausage factory stuff should stay in the factory.
Awesome! 3 Hall of Famers holding court is pure entertainment
DC does “ESPN’S DETAIL” and it’s always amazing!
Dom is right hands down! He was t being rude he just wants equal respect from DC. Daniel feels like if he watched a fight that he doesn’t have to go and rewatch it. That’s just silly. I love that they did this though. When you don’t like something your homie says. Instead of talking shit you just address it with him.
Im triggered from all the gaslighting from cruz
Dominic once again looking like a total nutjob.  I wonder if he has kids lol.
Used to be a fan of Cruz during his rivalry with team Alpha Male.... Can't stand him any longer. What a pompous narcissistic pos. Everyone should steer clear of him, he will throw you under the bus eventually....
Dominic Cruz has no integrity, lies out of his teeth and if this is his love imagine what his hate is?  He says something and then denies he says it or says: wait… I didn’t say that.  Disgusting human being and anyone who doesn’t see why he is wrong… I am so happy I am not your friend lol.
Dom is hangry and a dick. Honestly imo I can’t stand the guy. He comes off as a snake in the grass. A friend to your face, but then when you’re not around, he talk’s bad about you. A friend that is okay with you borrowing their car, just to then turn around and call the cops to report it stolen. A friend that you wouldn’t trust to hold your wallet or be alone with your girl.
This should be titled "DC sits down with a narcissist and another narcissist interrupts to mediate"
Listening to Dominick Cruz talk is like stuffing a KFC biscuit into your ears…that’s how dry it is
This is an AMAZING work, all around. Good jobs, guys.
This was the best publicity move Dom could've made before his fight
Bisping is the greatest
YOU GUYS ARE ALL TERRIBLE ANALYSTS AND WHY WOULDNT YOU BE??!! YOU GOT PUNCHED IN THE HEAD FOR 20 YEARS!!!!!!!LOVE YOU
DC only knows loyalty, trust and brotherhood. Dom doesn't fully understand these values to the extent that DC does. Dom made statements that went far beyond criticism, like DC is just doing it for a paycheck. Even if DC didn't watch film, Dom could have told him in private, rather than making those statements in public. Dom isn't wrong that DC could probably prepare more and devote more time to watching film, but his approach is unprofessional and a breach of trust/friendship. Also, Dom is not DC's boss lol
I’m pretty sure if someone I consider as a friend,said something like that about me,I would cut them immediately.
WTF just happened?
This is Grade A entertainment 😭😭🤣
Probably the best mma content i have seen in a long while, bravo DC Pure gold 🥇
To be honest I do enjoy Dominick Cruz commentating better than DC  i feel he's a better analyst.
B l k ppl hate a c c o u n t a b I l I t y
Why would someone do that to a friend? Dom is crazy 😂
dc is right 100% dom is such a prick but i still like him .
Someone on Twitter said Bisping appearing in this is like when a character enters the scene of your favorite sitcom. Couldn't have been a more perfect comparison
Dc is trash at commentary but he is 100% right that was fucked that dom said that
sodium lol
omg thats money XDDD
Good for dc
its also nice to see world class fighters settling things with words and not fist. thats classy.
Dom's right. DC is horrible on the commentary
Dom is jealous.....period
Bisping: “I don’t think there’s a right or wrong answer here.”  Dom: “You’re right, I’m not wrong.”
honestly i have to give dc credit for his opening statement.  If u have a private convo it should stay private.
Dominic is in no place to call out DC. DC is a better commentator than Dominic
I feel like dc feels like he's under a microscope.. after he was accused of being biased when his team members fight and now Cruz saying he doesn't watch film. He may be a little nervous with his position as a commentator. And that's why he's taking it so hard
This was so great. It's so refreshing to see 2 adults actually talk out their differences instead of back and forward pettiness on social media.
Cruz thought McGregor was trying to gas out Khabib.
Wow the ego on Dom repeating "I'm not wrong" over and over again.. Well, you are
Damn I used to love Dom. Now he kinda just seems salty about everything. Overreacting and accusing Keith Peterson because he got messed up by Triple C. And now this 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Dom has always been condescending, trying to outsmart others verbally for a win. he never took responsibility for his recent loss and blamed the ref for early stoppage. He equated DC to a child that needs to take responsibility. Dom is never funny and always pompous.
Bisping getting in the middle of them is just the cherry on top! 🤣🤣🤣
This is gold
Gotta say that makes sense why dc gets called out by all the fighters when he does commentary and they don't like it. I find it pretty disrespectful to the fighters to not give them the due respect
Well definitely a bigger fan of Bisping and less of a Cruz fan after this. One guy is your boy who holds you accountable in private and one guy is a "snake in da grass".
If you're his friend, the irony of you calling him out on this 2 days before a huge fight is not lost here... deal with it after his fight, which he is asking you to do some prep work on, that's really all he was saying. Love you both and I really pray this is just a publicity stunt.
this is 11 minutes of pure comedy
So basically Dominic's criticism is all about him and how DC calls his fights.  Wow.  What a bum.   Would never want Cruz as a co-worker.
style has no age limit, media, these days, are shit miners...if they can find an acorn in the truth they will chew it up and spit it out as shit.  Thanks for doing this guys.
I’ve been a critic of DC in the past but Dom is in the wrong here
You can tell at the beginning Doms like I’d rather be anywhere but here lmao
Miss Mike Goldberg 😔
Dom, Dom, come on man.  You're making yourself look like an ignorant kid.  I agree with DC and Michael.  You don't out your friends/teammates in an open forum, and if you can't see that it's just sad...
Remember the time when Cruz said " I think conor is trying to gas khabib out by letting him punch in the face"? How ironical
So Dominick Cruz is saying in the public what he would have said to DC in private. He is not the sugarcoating type, he likes to be real, no matter the time or place. I know it must be a bitter pill for some to swallow specially as friends but he speaks his mind and keeps it real, nothing personal, just his opinion its not his fault the media runs it wrong and people inly read the title not the whole content.
Two belts is all the preparation DC will ever need. He's observant, charismatic, and funny. Let's be honest, when it is a team of three people on the desk, not everybody needs to be a historian.
When people dunk on Dominick’s commentary, it’s basically either over the ‘Conor letting Khabib gas himself out punching him’ bit, or when he said Jessica Andrade couldn’t lift Rose right before she did and slammed her. Those were definitely wrong calls, but every announcer makes those. Nobody is perfect. Dom is leagues better than most. Yet those two comments are used to say he’s a bad commentator.  The reason I think most people actually think that is because he has that snarky delivery when he talks, and that + his self-assurance makes people feel stupid (or maybe like they’re being belittled).  (I like both of these guys on commentary, for what it’s worth, and I don’t know why DC has somehow become the whipping boy of the MMA Twitter community)
I love these guys
Dominick Cruz is being a prink. Zero guy code. Hope he loses this weekend and DC watches the film 1000 times. Love DC & Bisping. Two authentic dudes.
DC you and The COUNT Should have a once a week Collaboration, just my opinion. You and Bisping are super good!
Cruz is the biggest wind up. Guarantee DC and Bisping would love to just lay one on him.
Lmao the end bisping is fing hilarious
This whole video…I wanna hang out with them! Haha. Awesome.
This was oddly entertaining 😂
DC got called out for being eh lazy!!! Lol. He salty.
Let's not forget Cruzs commentary at Mcg vs Khabib
This video is fucking amazing!!! 😂🤣
Kudos to Dom for dealing with this nonsense right before a fight 😂
I think that was a damn good conversation that many adults are incapable of understanding. There doesn't need to be a right or wrong. Just a couple folks hashing things out, presenting their views, and having some laughs.
This entire thing shows how pathetic the media is and also just how stupid fans are. They read the headline, they draw conclusions, not even willing to spend 2 minutes reading the article let alone watch the video. This is what it's like for adult men to banter and rib each other, something amerilards are too sensitive to understand.
That was pure gold! Bisping showing up was the icing on the cake!  Loved that back and forth!
Show me the money DC 🤑💰🤑💰🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel like the philosophy of not bringing private talk to media is unfortunately dying. “Am I not allowed to have an opinion?” Yes dom. You are. Man to man. Not man to twitter. Man to media. Or man to camera.
Is this The View?
Dom has little Man syndrome
Dominick was in the wrong here...hes just to egotistical to accept it...
“Sodium sounds good right now” no Dom, no it doesn’t. No one calls salt sodium when they season things. That makes no sense Dom.
It's a miracle if we see Jon Jones across from DC lol
This was amazing!!
Lol I like Dom more and more legit he's actually pri smart
LMAO I fucking love the bromance
MMA Talk brought me here and I'm so glad!  I never knew this channel existed.  I love D.C. 😄
I love how RIGHT after Cruz says to DC “after you’re done talking to me, you can’t wait to get out...” DC goes, “I can’t do this anymore. I’m done.” Lolol. DC was pissed. Cruz knows how to get under people’s skin. So funny.
Truth is. Dom isn't your friend. Evidence is there.
5:38 Dominic Cruz isn't dry but the first seasoning he can think of is "sodium"?! 😆
criticizing your colleagues work ethics and professionalism in that way is just not appropriate. Props to DC for trying to hash it out in a friendly manner, but Cruz still come out as a complete jerk. Dude your performance in the biggest ufc ppv event in history was embarrassing. JR was correcting everything you were saying!
You don't embarrass your kid though dom!! There is a difference between holding someone accountable and putting them on blast especially when nothing is actually factual. Thats not a friend.
DC didnt shut it down and its DC's fault. He didnt feel a need to say anything. Now look at him. This is 100% DC. Dominic said I have said this to your face. DC even said "I have no need to argue or explain myself". Oh well that's what you get.
DC need to let people sentences out for the love of God!!!
5:58 oh lord this turning into a WWE skit 🤣
This is A-tier promotion at work by Dominic Cruz with his friends playing along. He's in the prelims, he has to step it up a notch to get back on the main card.
5:33 - 5:36 That pained "Dominic Cruz!!!!" 😆😆🤣
DC don’t realize this dude not his friend
I love Dom as an analyst and commentator, But this right here, childish..
You have a good commenting team, no right no wrong..team commenting effort.
Is it Dom's fault that he's smarter than all current commentators and MMA fighters?   You keep going, Dom.
I like how they go from coy to confrontation in less than a minute 😆
Dom should never say those things publicly!!!!
Daniel just gained a lot of trust by posting this!
This vid has 0 dislikes. Thats a perfect in street fighter
Dc is the best and nobody can change my mind easy
This was hard to watch, because what Dominick did according to my opinion is that he threw his friend under the bus public ally. Never in my time as a friend have I brought up things that are private or things I didn't like of my friends in a public setting. I always tell my friends directly what I think of them and when I feel they did something wrong or wronged me I should say.    This is not how you treat your friends I agree with DC on this and I am doing my best to understand Cruz but I'm having trouble to do so. I am trying to put myself in his shoes and he feels like DC talked bad about his fighting skills or something and I kinda understand that too, but still you talk about that in private to him not in public. Never in public.
Dom: I appreciate you as an analyst. Also Dom: I put you on mute 🤐
Dominic has no room to critic DC after his commentary with the khabib vs mcgregor fight lol
They made this interview so entertaining😂😂😂
Love this
😆
Lmfao this is like 3 brothers talking 😂😂😂
Dominic Cruz seems like that one stubborn friend we all have who would never admit if he is ever wrong, Dom just agree that you f'd up! lol
Accountability is love 😂 these guys need a show together!!
For someone who always talks as if he is the smartest person in the room (I.e. patronizing/condescending speech), it’s ironic how he plays the idiot when DC called him out for his unprofessionalism. However, kudos to Dominic - now I’m paying attention to his fight on the undercard and want to see him lose all the more lol.
Love this but you shouldn’t be doing this to Dom on fight week. Learn your place.
I most be hard been a college of Dom Cruz..the man it's toxic..
These 3 need a podcast hahahah 😂
Why is Dom going down this hole he has a fight to prepare for.
Daniel called Dom "Dry" and it didn't even phase him. Really enforces the fact that Dom is Dry. LMAO! He should have been an accountant or mortician. I can easily envision him in both roles.
This is funny 😂😂😂
"one guy who keeps it real" HAHA, yeah right Dom.  Dominic's infamous quote -  "He's actually gassing out Khabib, by letting him punch his face in open guard" (Conor vs Khabib)
This was really entertaining!
I loved this, especially when Bisping made an appearance
Always thought Dom was a major douche
Dom is a smart guy but it's like he likes to be insufferable and seems like he's craving attention. And not the kind that makes me want to watch his fights.
You three need a podcast. It would be one of the most entertaining podcasts ever!
Good content right here. Could have gone for another hour and still would have been great.
Wtf is Cruz’s problem
DC move like a Gangsta, Cruz wrong regardless if DC watches film or not based on his lame actions.
You either talk someone private or you either talk to him public, there is nothing in between.
Dominic ( DC smelled like cigarettes and alcohol ) Cruz
DC knows how to be a real friend. This was hilarious though.
Worst sports commentator in history. Makes me ears bleed
Dominic Cruz has always been a crybaby..I love when rogan  disagrees with something cruz says during a fight...happens alot
Dom is insufferable
disappointed to hear Dom be like this changes my feeling towards him, hope he gets beat Saturday
Cruz butt hurt because DC does his job different from him and the UFC brand pays him more attention, as punishment Faber should be made to call fights with Cruz.
Mad salty and he's a hater. That's no friend imo 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
When Dom said this is more interesting then  talking about the fight 🤣 and the lady laughing after DC says he hired a researcher 🤣 this made my day 😆
Dominic is so hard headed 🤦🏻‍♂️
Dominick Cruz said “Mcreggor is gassing Khabib out by getting pounded on the floor” dudes a shit commentator.
bisping is the best. i hate to see DC and Dom fighting :(
Its like dominick cruz has a social disability and completely cant understand how he did DC dirty
this was the funniest shit ever LOL
10:03 Dom is talking and DC completely ignores what he has to say. (Pretty disrespectful not looking someone in the eye who's talking to you directly)
When Bisping walked in, I was half expecting a Royal Rumble!
Cruz is correct. Dc do be on some homer stuff 😂
At least Dom is a consistent asshole. This is most likely his only revenue aside from fighting while DC and Bisping have other avenues they can explore so it makes since he would take it "more seriously" than they would. Either way, he broke the locker room code of ethics.
Dom is bar far the best X’s and O’s Analyst.  He literally can call what’s going to happen before it does.  However it’s nice to have him paired up with one of the other knuckle heads. Also Paul Felder  is great as well.
Dom, you’re flippin baby powder.
Dom is just fishing complements!
DC looked so happy to see bisping come and mediate.
Dom comes off like such a douche. His rationale is ridiculous.
Reality is there is truth in what both are saying
These guys know how to monetize shit.
I was waiting for the moment Daniel ragdolls Dom!
Daniel was spot on saying Cruz was wrong as a friend to say what he said in a public forum. I know they’re friends, but Cruz’s whole tone was just disrespectful to Cormier.
Dc is wrong and a terrible commentator
I love Dom and respect his fight IQ, and agree he is the best commentator, but he could have pulled DC aside, not blast him in the media. It's not his job to keep DC accountable, it's Dana's, and yes he gave media the cannon fodder, so he needs to take some responsibility himself too, to avoid looking like a hypocrite, which he does. It was low, especially being so close of friends, although I am partial to DC to keep things honest.
Dom is so stuck on being right or wrong on the film research issue…..that he is missing the biggest issue that calling your friend and coworker out like that is wrong.  On top of that, its not even Doms job,  DC is accountable to production execs expectations, not Dom’s.  I’m surprised Dom can’t see that dynamic is an issue
Dc is good guy, and he understand this business.
I'm just here for the $$$🤑
30 seconds in : Starts arguing   I love it 😂😂😂
Daniel Cormier is so weak minded. So much so he demanded a sit down on air just to get back. What a sook
Ironic when most people mute Cruz's commentary.  Ruined the Khabib - McGregor fight
I'm watching this and just remembering Doms commentary of Khabib and Conor. At one point he was saying how effective Conor was by blocking Khabibs punches with his face 😂
Am I the only one here who also mutes DC and finds this entire video of DC trying to get Dom to change his opinion in public cringe 😬 😳?
I hope Keith Peterson refs Dominicks fight 😂
dude is about to have a fight and dc is ragging on him
Dom could learn a lot by the phrase "Praise publicly, correct privately." Sure, he's being real, but it's not cool to air your buddies dirty laundry out like that
DC knows he's right, why else would this interview happen? DC this doesn't change the facts sir. He's not your son, he owes nothing to you.
Cormier was already pulled by his boss Dana White for being biased with his friends. This is either unfair or indicates what Dominick is saying is true. He only calls what he wants. And it is true DC is quite biased. While he is a physical beast and killer the man has a marshmallow for a heart.
I’d rather watch Dc than Dom anyways.
I like Cormiers commentary and has a good announcing voice but you can’t deny he is so bias in some fights.
This is so wholesome, i love it. They are all right, Dom is just “the type of guy, who doesn’t have a filter and doesn’t think about the repercussions of what he says. At the end of the day he did give the media a perfect touchdown pass but in his mind he did nothing wrong.
Kind of wish Bisping wouldn’t have interfered lol that was great
The sound isn't working?
That was some snake shit... Dominick! 🤣  Maybe now he'll know how the media really is and learn from this!
Cruz just runs his mouth
This was incredibly entertaining. I hope someone notices and it becomes a thing. 1 subject 3 chairs and 3 commentators
This video made my day love it. And i just subscribe to your channel DC didn’t know you have one. Peaceeeeeee!
This turns into an absolute gem! 😂✌🏼
"He wants to get in and out, get the job done, make his money, and I think he cares about us but it’s just different." This is plainly wrong and hurtful, saying that in public.
Lol DC got triggered quick. This is funny
Dom I think DC was a Silver medalist not a gold.   You have to watch more film Dom.
DC is the GOAT. He owned it, called it out and Dom was 100% in the wrong
Dominic is dry dry dry.  That's why DC is way better!!!!
DC vs. DC
DC bro I hope you see this bc this is the main event it’s more entertaining than anything bro
Someone’s been cutting weight.
Get these two on a podcast, forever.
Dominic is always a whistle blower.  Maybe it's a attention seek.
Dom definitely feeling it fight week 😂
As a mma fan since 2002 these three are the best fighter commentators of all time. Funny as hell, great analytical fight breakdown and different views. Great stuff man.
Cruz was wrong for saying what he said, but I’m glad he said it though cuz it was interesting. Though I think DC is one of the best commentators hands down no competition. He literally calls it, and then it happens. Don’t worry about this DC.
The thing is...Dom is still fighting...hes not in the same mind frame as DC and Bisping as hes not retired, hes still cutting weight and busting his ass, hes a lot more touchy about certain things but that being said, he didn't have to expose DC like that,Its like snitching to the bosses but then again im kinda glad he did.
I love Dom as he speaks he trust and no holds bards ad stars the shit and stays calm in doing so! Love it
Glad they recorded this
Now THIS, IS COMEDY!
I think this is the difference between MMA fighters... and prima donnas of other sports and media... they literally just hashed it out no edits... no BS.
Dom said its not wrong to give his personal feeling about his colleagues to media then he sais the media misquotes everyone and he was misquoted, WTF!
Between Dom and DC… I’m gonna pick Bisping 😂
Glad I clicked on the link, this convo migh've brought me back to watching mma. thanks guys.
Bisping is playing peacemaker.... what a world we live in 2021...
Eveybody  knows Dom is sensitivity and he weak
Dom is so defensive man haha
yooo! i just hope dc pins this msg men cuz i am a hardcore Jon jones fan since 2010 and i used to dislike dc cuz of jones rivalry but being of the fan of the ufc  and seeing who DC is as a person  he really made me a fan of him straight up a loving guy who all his team mates, colleagues, co-workers respect and follow, most importantly see how he is with his family, to be that when most cant be father's nowadays is something to admire, he made me a fan of him to be honest, any DC hater should be ashamed disliking they man cuz he ain't got nothing to be hated y'all. keep shining DC and as a black man myself we proud of u big doug and maybe in some years we can give u an African nationality just like francis and kamaru once said lol getting to know your roots and all that, at the end much love and keep doing what you doing
Damn Cruz is a little snake 🐍 in the grass
Danggg. Cruz was NOT having anything on the menu. LOL! Meanwhile, DC simply couldn't get change for his $5 from anyone..left hanging hard at the EOS.
Dominic.. is who ? DC is best to listen to...
I like Dominic Cruz  I think DC is not a great commentator
oh i didnt say you are bad, i didnt say you are not awesome, i just mute your commentary because thats what you do when someone is dope analyst/commentator. dominick broke under face to face pressure and wanted to turn ugly into pretty situation in the end. i guess its the ego, it hurts when you are a very good fighter whole life and some retired fighters can still manhandle you. why dc didnt asked why he mutes his commentary if he thinks he is not bad or that he is great behind the desk? i guess dc also didnt want no more "trouble" in the end.
Bisping the MAN!! almost Died instead of Tapping 😳😮😲
Absolutely love this. Dom is straight from the heart, and hats off to DC for hitting him up at after
You guys handled this amicably, which shows the maturity of both of you. You talked it out. Most knuckle head would bang it out, but then again, a heavyweight vs a bantamweight might not be the most even of playing fields.
DC doesn't do research but at least he's likeable
I was cracking up this was SO FUNNY loolz. this made me wayyy less depressed. THEN BISPIBING SHOWED UP LOOOL
All 3 should be analyzing at the desk for a fight
Does everyone not understand Dom was responding to a question, he has always been brutally honest and dry. He was speaking his mind, he’s starving anything can fly out his mouth.
So is DC out now or what? Cause I’ve heard that he isn’t commentating the fights anymore and I’ve heard that he still is…
Friggin epic
Dominick  is a single minded individual. Hyper focused. No room for soft skills. That said, he is honest and a  good dude overall.
You put me on blast publicly like that, and try to spread propaganda about me, you are not my friend period. You are my enemy end of the story
“Am I a analyst or a comedian” shots at rogan 😂🔥
Dom should have come to you in private and bring his concerns to your face instead of going public and nothing wrong with having assistant to do some background work for you, thats called efficiency
“What did I say wrong in your fight?”  “Nothing, I don’t listen to it. I mute it, I said that.” 😂
dom "I'm not dry, I put sodium on things"
I’d be happy if I never heard dom commentating again
Not gonna lie, Dom would have you rethinking the way you tie your shoes. "But why, do you loop your laces that way?" "Is that how you've done the most simple task your whole life?"
I lost so much respect for Dominick Cruz
Fucking awesome 😂
This whole beef seems like it’s done for publicity 😂
Wtf bisping came outta nowhere lol
Someone had to say it. DC has been taking the piss with his sub-par commentary and it was getting worse.
Cormier's ass needs a whole other chair.
Lol bro Cruz kinda a dick 😂 I think dc handled that really well tho
Lol Dominick is just stone cold and tells it how he sees it, DC is just getting defensive....possibly on purpose...he's most likely been looking for a reason to have a video of him and Dom arguing over something or another.
the three stooges
This is raw - This is good , good for Humanity.  We can agree to disagree.  I like when Dom says " Do I have to be a comedian? "  Its true - He is dry, but thats Dom. D.C was not a comedian in the beginning, he turned into one once his personality spread its wings. And thats ok too.
I get the feeling Cruz doesn't have many friends
This is excellent
Cruz and DC relation will never be same again sadly cruz did this thing..
hes didnt wanna name someone cruz fought even with him putting this up its a telling sign
Take this shit to the octagon!!!!
Dominic is wrong. This should have been private period!  What’s wrong with Bisbing ?  He is too loud , talks too much -has oral diarrhea .  And tops the charts ahead of Conor Mc Taper .lol.  DC is a great fun commentator
Dominic: DC doesnt prepare enough Also Dominic: I believe that you (DC) are an Olympic gold medalist  Uncle Chael: Okay great
Dom is goofing on DC...DC is biting...
Dom threw dc under the bus lol
Dom Cruz on fire 🔥
MAKE ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DC!!!!!
“Conor is tiring Khabib by punching his face in.”
HAHAHAHA YO THIS KEEPS Getting better. i wish i was crew
Listen Cruz makes some good points but I can’t forget when he said Conor was gassing out Khabib while getting punched in the face several times!
Ufc is entertaining on so many different levels😂
Some of y’all are taking this WAAAAAY to seriously. They are boys and this will help DC’s channel grow. Genius and hilarious. Two very good champions going back and forth.
I love that DC aired this out right away cause I felt the same way for him. Ad a colleague, you should tell him that in person first before putting that on media
And yes Dom is DRY BUUUUUT super educational during fights and Daniel is more lively and fun and joe Rogan is both
You're a great analyst. I would just rather mute you when watching the fights.
These 3 need a show together lol
Dominick, just drop it man. You're wrong for talking about DC. Besides Jon Jones, no one hates DC. But you take your opinion and go to the media and start talking about DC. Come on man, Dominik you are good, but DC is way better at being a commentator.
Dominik Cruz Is a hater. He wants dc spot lol!!!!
I'm here because I was watching Michael bisping's Channel and you are on it with Dominick Cruz keep up the good work champ
Dom is the ultimate alpha male lmao. And I honestly think that he’s just messing with everyone at this point. Love Dom lol
Yea that was childish and weird by Cruz lol
I think Dominic is pretty cranky from the weight cut but still this was awkward and funny all at the same time lol
that chair looks a bit shaky that dc is sitting in.  i hope it's reinforced.
this is like me and my best friend 🤣 this right here made the entire fight week!!! i love these two. respect
Now that I recovered from this awkwardness, I'll say that Dom was in the wrong for saying that stuff publicly. That's DCS career and job, say it privately ya baffoon.
dammit im just glad i found out DC has a youtube channel, i feel bad that i learned about it from Bispings video about this.
In the Cruz corner on this one but love you both. Accountability in the public in the mma world can actually sometimes make an improvement. It's also not that much of a big deal about not watching much film as a goat himself, already possessing that knowledge. But it's funny I tried to mute DC the other week when he said to Anik and Bisping "I can't believe how much you guys study." During the actual fight. I still think studying is important and Cruz is coming from a place of love.  Think about it like this. Jessica Rose Clark recently called out D Cruz for the stuff that happened with Hans Molenkamp and Monster energy. Cody Garbrandt in his ufc interview still took the monster bottle off the table even two years after the incident almost. Yes, Cruz could have done things differently as a friend but so many people benefit from when you say to someone 'how can it be better.'  Aside from that I do think DC tends to waffle on sometimes in commentary and I do agree with Cruz being dry at times too.
This was great
After This loss Dom gonna tell ESPN : D.C was never my friend 🤣
Bruh, I like DC, because he AIN'T that nerd, I love to listen to Dom because he IS that nerd. Cruz did DC dirty on this. Cruz comes off looking like an arrogant scumbag. This is psychopathic levels of taking the 'truth' to the next level. Bro, people tell you things in confidence when they want to confide in you, and you bond over this private things. To do it on air like that is crude. That's not a friend, that's a coworker, most definitely selfish. "Who made that rule?", bruh that's basic human code of conduct amongst people, O MY GOD WHO IS THIS DELUDED?!
Theyve both said some pretty silly things on commentary
This would b a good commentator group
Accountability is love, I have to agree with Dominic.  I don't agree with Dominic on anything, so good on you Dominic.  What a great video to all of you, when Bisping can sneak his way into a video you know it's going to be good.
Who cares how much film he watches! He’s a good analyst, he’s likable, and he knows the fighters, and he knows the sport! Dominic definitely should not have gone on live TV, and said what he said!
Just watched this on Bispings channel and now subscribed to DC
Dom is getting upset about proper fighter notes 😂 these people have families 😂 dc is training the kids in gilroy he doesn’t have time to be home all day like you dom
geezus when did dominick get so annoying …?
cruz is wrong. Did ur buddy dirty!
Cruz is boring af lol prefer dc as a commentator
This is a ridiculous argument, but it's fun to watch them get at it. 😂
DC is the most patient man alive.
Dom is gonna lose now
Wow! Dominick "JUDAS" Cruz. I loooved DC when he was fighting, and as a commentator and analyst he is the best! Cruz was being a really arrogant jackass to speak of DC in this manner, and the way that he is speaking in this video I don't appreciate it. This is something that SHOULD NOT have been aired publicly because it will be taken in a way that is negative towards DC, and it could possibly jeopardize his employment. Judas Cruz is acting really obtuse not to understand that this is not something that you do as a friend or colleague. DC should have told him publicly than that his time has most likely passed, and that he is not being realistic thinking that he has a chance to get the belt again. Please! No loyalty these days!
Before I watch I would like to say that DC  is Million times better then cruz facts💯
Dominick is letting DC and Bisping verbally beat him down to tire them out
This was terrible.
dom's such a narcissist, I wish I had your composure DC
You don't air out people you call friends just because you're trying to "keep it real" bro; you say that in private, and in a better way.  Dom could've easily said I don't focus on DC's commentary, but I appreciate the perspective he brings as a past double-champ, and Olympic gold medalist.  Stoicism ain't for everybody.
Had to pause this a couple times due to second hand awkwardness.
Hilarious interview between friends 🤣🤣🤣
Bisping is the greatest of all time. The real bmf , the real champion , bisping is real
Dominick Cruz POV is arrogant as hell
Dom is the type of guy that gets confused when you ask him why he's dating his best friend's ex
Dominic can hay he’s not apologizing for what he said but is apologizing for saying it the way he did, out in public.
Hahaha, this was a fun "interview" :D
I love Cruz he is such a character. Fuck the fake corporate professionalism
Dominic sounds like a defensive and arrogant individual unable to listen to another person’s opinion.
I love DC even more ..❤️
cruz was out of order massively.  but is this a ploy to generate interest in dc’s channel and keep cruz relevant
Dom is salty af....
You two got past the awkward hesitation at the start and just got straight into it 🤣😂
Dom is gaslighting the fuck out of everyone.
DC is right, Dom shouldn't say that shit in public - like what is the point? Get DC canceled? Even tho Dom is probably right - DC strikes me as a little bit lazy, but that's all right, he adds great value to the cast. I personally think he's the most enjoyable to listen to of the three. And even tho, he might not be as well prepared, he still offers great analytical insight.
Bisping shouldn’t have hopped in. Should have allowed Dom to be a warrior out there.
Love Bisping entering the conversation.
Dominic. You were and are wrong. You should never have said that about DC to the media. Then, you say you like his commentary, but mute it when you watch him work. Which is it?   I bet you do the same with your friends and significant other as well. There is a time and a place for everything, you were wrong.
DC is the man, could take major offense at what was said but takes it on the chin and doesn't hold a grudge when really he should given the disrespect shown. There's room for all styles. Cruz has literally no humour but is brilliant at calling what is happening, too much of that isn't good for the viewer though fight after fight you need that banter and humour to get through 7 hours of action and chat once the fights are done. They actually work well complementing each other.
DOMINICK CRUZ IS THE G!
What world do we live in where Michael Bisping is the mediator? I do like this banter though. Cruz is the best analyst out there and he is dry. LOL
put dc and cruz on for prelims just having a convo
8:40 media ^^
#JESSEONFIRE
This is coming from the same Dominic Cruz who said Conor was defending Khabib’s punches with his face to tire him out. Lol…creditability out the window.
Cruz was right in the same way that my autistic nephew is often right.
Dom said he turns the sound off when DC is commentating. Said that DC doesn't watch film. Said that he's just there for a paycheck and then leaves. All of those are things you would say to get your coworker fired. Definitely uncalled for from Dom.
What an angry little man
Subscribing to get the cash at 100K....I mean watch video and fight breakdowns with DC. P.S. - I'm Dominick's weight......maybe I can tell him for you.
I wish this video was longer
Dom should be going after joe rogan not DC lmao. Joe Rogan is the worst color commentator the ufc has. DC is actually a decent commentator.
Dominick Cruz must be great at parties 🤣
Dominic is not comprehending. If you call yourself a friend, some facts and or opinions  need only be private. Or private first b4 you make it public. But he will get it one day when it happens to him...
Such an unprofessional interview.
This is fucking great!!!! Hahaha!!!
I just think it's funny how Dom went on about "keeping the heartrate down" during the interviews yesterday and today he had an argument for 10 minutes lol
Dom is wrong in this… he went at DC because he got sensitive about something DC said about him… They’re both great on the mic
Dominic is just jealous because dc is 10 times the star he will ever be.
Imagine a conversation like this between conor & uncle Chael 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dom is super dry
Wait....is this an example of grown men discussing differences? Huh...wierd
4:15 DC showed some inadvertent Alpha by pulling Dom towards him a bit.
Feel like DC is in the right, Cruz loves to be the edge lord
Why is 2/3 of Daniels ass hanging out of the chair 🪑?
Just like school kids arguing on the back of the bus. Love to see it. So genuine and these three are a massive reason why this sport continues to go from strength to strength
0
this is gold
Loved that! 3 greats making some points and having a laugh!
Praise in public, constructive criticism in private! Dominick "Lose" is a terrible human and a bad colleague! He tried to throw DC under the bus and potentially cost him his job. Dom is a boring commentator and he should be fired and released from the UFC for his actions. Forget that guy! DC, Rogan and Big A are the dream team!
This was hilarious 😂 I love this sport lol
DC tapping him on the knee
One more subscriber ✌
Yo DC is genuinely a good dude  Look at how he handles himself when heated. When I grow up I want to be DC... Even though I'm a full grown man.
Dom starting to sound like Diego Sanchez …
Dom has no moral
This.
Dom has the same demeanor in this interview as the one with him and TJ hahahahaahaha
Dom that is the most unwritten RULE that everyone follows, or better said should follow.
You damn well know D.C don’t be watching shit the majority of the time.
Dom, when you want to CRITICIZE a friend you do it PRIVATELY. What you did was PUT HIM DOWN because you didn't like the way he commentated your fight. You're wrong all day. That was a shitty and very selfish way to do him.
I can never forgot Dom's commentary in the khabib vs conor fight - "Conor is trying to gas Khabib out" 🤣
Lmfao Dominic talking about his “spicy hot takes” and says he’s adding Sodium 🧂
Never really liked Dom now I really don't like him
I'm kinda hoping Dom gets KO'ed or Dominated after watching this and I bet DC and Joe do too
dom was a snitch in another life
Im with DC on this one ! You can go out on public and rant out negative opinions on someone u publicly pretend to call each other "Bros" looks like Dom may have some underground hate for DC and got the chance to pour his feelings publicly and  Dom pretends to lack emphathy not caring wat he says may remove food off the table for DC...    DC dont believe that snake.. he is NOT* ur bro.. he would see u get fired and give a smile on ur face and say.." im not the one who fired you*   he that typa person !  I hope he looses on his upcoming fight !
I like talking to you... let's taaalk... 🤣🤣🤣
Dc is real 💯
The former heavyweight middleweight and bantamweight world champions at it for 13 minutes
Love it
Don’t do it dc! Lol He so lame trying to put words in your mouth smh that’s wild. I know Dana hot lol
Dom can't understand .😭 . instead of talking to everybody .he should tell him directly and privately . If my friend talk bad about me to everybody ,i got no friend.
Tallon with Dominick Cruz is like taking to the kid  with autism about being tactful when criticizing others
I agree with dom when it comes to dc being prepared for commentating but at the same I agree with dc that he didn’t have to go on stage and say it. But I’m not going to lie sometimes when the fights are happening and dc is trying to to have a conversation with his colleagues it’s sort of distracting. And what did it for me was when Dc forgot Sean Brady’s name while interviewing him after the win. I feel like it’s fair to say dc isn’t one of the best and me personally I prefer Dom over Dc
Damn Dom this def kinda lowered my respect for you a little bit - DC coming at this in all the right ways and Dom refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of DCs POV. C'mon Dom..
Dominick Cruz always comes off as if hates the ppl he works with though
This is what happens when you have two egomaniacs broadcasting.  Lol
DCs commentary come soff as unprepared and unprofessional, I don't need your dad jokes, just call the fight.
Cruz is the down low Buddha of MMA
This was gold!!! More of this pls!!! lmao
More of this!!!
Dom is 100% corporate dc sucks
DC is so emotional HAHAHAHA
This is hilarious 😂, but I know DC be slacking off in the meetings
"When you're holding your child accountable is that not love?" 1. bringing his fam into it 2. yes that's love, now do it in front of the school board and friends and fam. completely diff story. 3. His commentary style might be different and brings a good dynamic to the team.  Dom seems to just be mad over hearing criticism on his fights. "You say I'm dry that's not my opinion" so he's allowed to think what he thinks about himself and Dc has to accept that he's not "analytical" enough. Not a good luck Dom. He was one of my favorites and lately seems like a stubborn child.
people keep saying he's keeping it real and honest and being a good friend.. there is a TIME and PLACE where some things are appropriate. you can go up to people on the street and call them ugly to their face and be technically right, but it's not APPROPRIATE and is considered rude. dominick cruz was 100% out of line for trashing on DC like that on stage with a mic in his hand, he should've knew his place and said what he thought privately, or at the LEAST not say it when you are ON STAGE like that.
I always though Dominick was a bit of a dick... He just keeps reinforcing that idea
Love ya DC!
Dominick is on some bs sometimes lol
Cruz, you literally don't appreciate him if you mute him though.
DC is so lovable.
These guys would be great drinking buddies!! Funny
Dom has the ego of a Prime time Conor McGregor without the skill.
Is this the END???
cruz is that kind of person where no matter how close you feel to him he doesnt even consider you. maybe hes wrong for that , or maybe u are?
You guys should do these more often!!
3 intelligent men...
Dominick Cruz just likes to argue LOLOL
That was wrong of him. Talking about DC’s job and livelihood.
5:40 I have so much sodium 😝😄
LMFAOOOO i loved this 😂😂😂
I've never laughed so hard at an interview with Dominic Cruz. He's about as dry as Kevin Durant's ankles. Say what you want about DC this interview  was hilarious and entertaining.
That's true that DC sounds sometimes lazy on the mic. He's becoming a Joe Rogan type of commentator and we already have someone to scream OH to everything happening.
Cormier has become a cloutchasing biased liar elevating his friends and connected coaches above fighters that are often winning. Why would you listen to a lying commercial that is reflecting the opposite of what's happening in a fight. Its shameless and obviously being fed through his earpiece as he lies for the company without hesitation and its ruined his likability as hes dishonest. Sad what people become for money.
I love how they talked about the fight for like 20 seconds 😂
This is that part time trash reporter’s fault, they picked up at a mcgregor event. How is he even a “reporter” his questions are something my little brother would ask who’s 7
Cruz that one annoying kid in class who thinks he’s always right lol
Cruz is my favorite fighter but he doesn’t understand friendships and the effect that words have on people, criticism like that should be told behind closed doors and handled with privately, not public. If he says that publicly people will listen and people might turn on him, it could mess up his brand, mess with his family and ultimately mess up one of his ways to provide for his family.
Hahaha great content bro
Cruz won the hand fighting
Cruz said “Conor was gassing khabib out” as he beat his face in. Nobody is perfect he got roasted for years for that. He shouldn’t of went public regardless how lazy dc is
Don't take it too hard, DC. Cruz said that Conor was absorbing Khabib's GnP from the bottom to "gas him out". You're the better commentator, and fighter.
Love you DC. Cut the noise. You’re a legend.
Imo DC, Rogan and Anik are the best crew
I dont like Dominick he is always dry and angry
Dom is tripping could be the weight cut, but in other sports commentator's never do this as a fighter whatever but as a commentator very un professional and comes over very jealous and petty. if DC uses an analysts to help prep for fights more power to him. Their are no rules to how to prep
Sorry DC, but I'm with Cruz on this one. He has every right to speak his mind in HIS interview about how HE feels.
Dom is right.
I cannot wait for Uncle Chael's take on this
Everything Dom said about DC I genuinely feel about Joe Rogans commentary, it seems lazy with his research unless it's a big name like Connor or Jon Jones
Dom seems to think he has some kind of intellectual gift, but really it’s just a passive aggressive attempt at bullying in this conversation. Painful to watch…almost as bad as his herky jerky fight style.
DC was right, and Cruz has ego issues
I can’t stand cruz he’s such a 🐩
With friends like Dom, who needs enemies.
Alpha male syndrome...please let them fight.
Brilliant content. Quality this getting a glimpse behind the curtain
DC the best thing to do would have acknowledged Doms criticism and say "You'll take it into consideration" and move on. You will make yourself a troll target because of your emotional responses.
Cruz is just jealous.  DC does an amazing job, he's been a great addition to the commentary.  Cruz is probably just trying to sabotage his "friend". Cruz is a fake and I really dislike him. He wishes he could take DC's spot. DC shouldn't have to justify himself to this clown,  Cruz is sitting there testing DC asking which punch etc. 🙄 Cruz your a clown. Bisping you instigator!
Dom is not a cool guy at all. Guys trash talk as locker room talk.
im only here for the money LMAOOO
kek
Love these people. Legends.
That’s so crazy. There is a noticeable difference between DC when he first started commentating and now. He was really bad initially. I thought he just got into the swing of things, but having a researcher makes sense now.
YOU JUST DONT GO PUBLIC ABOUT SOMEBODY PAYING SOMEONE TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK. PERIOD. I PAID MY WAY THROUGH SPANISH CLASS IN COLLEGE. ALL CAPS INTENTIONAL. lol
I think this should be settled with a thumb war tbh
I remember when Cruz was commentating on one of DC's fights and calling him the whole fight a Greco-Roman wrestler 😂😂😂 Cruz needs to shut up someties
I'd love to know what the 3 of them genuinely though about Rogan, there's no other sport that has a conspiracy nut, unfunny comedian who commentates on it. Everything Cruz said about DC, I think about Rogan. If there was a feed where he was muted that'd be great, that's the one I'd listen to. Rogan should do Buffers job (he's awesome announcing the fighters for the weigh ins) and I'm fine with him doing post fight interviews. He was the interview guy when he started on the UFC but he just shouldn't be commentating, he gets everything wrong.
Dom is insufferable
I see a lot of my old self in him, this is how I know lol
DOM sounds very immature here.  Have you opinion.  Share feedback privately.  That's what professionals do.
I absolutely love DC. oh yeah Cormier ain't so bad himself xD
Dom smelled alcohol and cigarettes on Daniel and he felt Daniel cut this interview short.
lol. DOM IS A NARCISSIST
Dominick Cruz's commentary on the Habib and Conor McGregor fight was sad I'm glad Joe Rogan was there  put it him in his place that night cuz he was talking a whole lot of mess
What Dom did was wrong and shady and dissappointing to see  You do not question and criticise a friend & colleagues professional competence like that to a group of reporters on a public stage.  They may be friends but Dom must have some built up resentment towards DC which has led him to this crazy self justified public sabotaging of DCs professional image   It likely stems from the fact that DC is in indeed lazier, obv does less work preparation than Dom and others and yet still does a great job whilst being much more loved and adored by his peers and fans, all whist effortlressly managing to light up every room he walks in to (which lets face it, is a quality we all wish we had)..  Taking that with Dom clearly having rooted shades of his own little man syndrome along with an inability to express a warm jubilous personality which can light up the room like DC, (who is constanty laughing and joking with everyone backstage).  And we may just have a guy who sits there watching DC joke and laugh with all those around him, secretly wishing he could do the same but having the type of ego which prevents him from ever admitting this to himself which could have allowed him to healthily process and manage those feelings.   So instead slowly builds up unconscious feelings of bitterness and resentment to the stage where he goes and says something like this about his friend/colleague in a public setting and yet still somehow doesnt see anything wrong with it. Instead actually justifying his own actions as a moral good deed of "telling the truth and calling his friend out because he cares about him"   Long story short..  Dom you suck and you need to process and purge that resentment ASAP because that was some straight up code breaking, backstabbing BS and you shoud be better than that
lol such a made up beef
the fact that dc put this out there is sick and a huge treat for us fans, thanks a lot 💪 this video was pure comedy gold and we got to see a side of these fighters that we don’t see often when they’re together
Did Michael said just put him in the Middle East and he will solve all the problems?
We all love you both! 😜
This was good can we have more like this
🤣🤣 DC, Dom was poking at you and you let him. Lol 🤦🏿‍♂️.who cares what he thinks. 🤷🏿‍♂️
Great conversation.  Loved the respect and self-control in a situation that could easily have turned sour.  Big respect to Cormier for responding like a gentleman.
« Conor is making khabib tired by letting him punch in the face » cruz shouldnt really complain. So many times his comments are bad and biased. He is not a great analyst and surely is jealous of dc/joe friendship and connexion when comentating ufc events
I’ve subscribed so guess that makes it all kind of worth it
This was great.
Cruz mad cause DC called his fight and didnt like how dc called it. So he took it personally and threw DC under the bus. DC prob didnt watch much film in the past than he does now.
A true friend would not DC like that publicly. I love Dom as a fighter and analyst. But if he really respected DC like he said he did, if he really cared about DC, he wouldn't be dissing him like that. From the beginning of the interview, you can tell Dom is pissed off and being defensive. Dom is a hypocrite bc he should have told DC the complete truth, that he doesn't respect him, he doesn't like him and most certainly, he doesn't consider him a friend.
Daniel i hope from now on you will do your homework and dont be lazy! You should take this commentator job seriously.
Cruz takes himself way too seriously. Could be the weight cut making him come off this bad.
cruz said some loving stuff but  it was only like  20% of what he said in that statement lol. i mean hejust alleyooped that one to the media and they slam dunked it.
I don't think Dom is a team player he's always been a lone wolf from what I gather and how he carries himself which is why he doesn't understand why what he did was wrong. It's still true but what he did was not cool imo.
Girls fighting!
cruz: when you called my fight, you sounded like you didn't watch my fights dc: what did i say that made you think that cruz: idk, i muted it. . . love you dc 💪
new series 'Honest feedback with DC' I'd watch every episode
Dummy dom, there’s a thing called respect. You don’t shit on your colleagues. I wouldn’t go to a news outlet and bash my coworker because I think someone else does a better job.
Let's be honest, they are all fighter and they have big egos. But Dom is taking it up a notch here, this for sure was a betrayal of DC as it can effect his job. DC and Bisping proved they're on the right side here by not bringing up the McGregor vs khabib fight where Dom was literally blinded by his bias.
lmao love how Cruz was like you don't have to defend yourself but he was defending himself when he was called boring   😂 😂 😂
Cruz was definitely wrong for saying that to the media.
Cruz is right.  Accountability is love.
Dominic Cruz is hilarious honestly I love him and I agree with alot of what he said lol I love this insight into the commentary team. He has no filter and that’s what makes him who he is, I do agree though DC has been abit sloppy as of present but he has a great personality.
That was really interesting and entertaining to watch! These three are as good as Barkley Shaq and the tnt NBA crew !
Subscribed cause of Bispings video at the end of his interview recap! We getting money at 100k!!
So stupid, DC probably knows it's true and that's why he got emotional
Tbf DC is a fight fan so he gets emotionally caught up in some fights. Rogan has the same tendency. Dom is logical and tries to take emotion out of it.  Both have their place.
2:50 burn dc!!!!!! Cruz telling it how it is lol
So much for the heart beat on check
Cruz did to DC what Charles Barkley did to Michael Jordan.   I don't necessarily know if it's wrong or right though 🤔
Dominick is a fuckin snake, no friend would undermine the integrity of his friend at something as crucial as his job, thats how DC earns his bread and living, a friend would never endanger such a thing.
It's fucked up for Cruz to have said anything at all. What was he hoping to accomplish by saying that? I enjoy DC's commentary and never once wondered if he watches "enough" film. DC provides real play-by-play commentary that people appreciate because he's explaining things from a technical perspective. This whole thing felt like Cruz was bitter over the way DC called his previous fight(s) - at times in this interview Cruz was literally quizzing DC as to which punches, specifically, he uses in his setups - petty as hell.
Cruz called him out publicly because if he did it privately nothing would change
Dom has seen something or felt something thats off with DC…… you can tell by the persona
This is marriage threapy
Dominic is very bad at commentary. Remember khabib conor fight? On the other hand DC is very technical and knowledge.
Cruz is jealous of DC commentary. DC is the most qualified commentator, he is even better than Joe Rogan. People respect Rogan because he has a platform and every fighter wants his platform. Speaking honest I think Pisbing is the most underrated commentator. He explains well where the fight is going on and how the fighter is gonna win
this is gold holy shit
Cormier is the better commentator and I honestly do not like to watch Cruz in the ring. He's good at lightly touching his opponent to score points and going for takedowns but he is not a good fighter at all. Matter of fact he is not UFC level. Cruz should is in a glass house and should not throw rocks.
I enjoyed that. Cruz is a real one. No bs with him
This feels like a private conversation...feels like we shouldn't be hearing this lol. Which is why it's such juicy content compared to what other people produce
I love Dom and his commentary…his fight iq is awesome.
Now, it is one of the top viewed video.
Dc's whole body is in that chair
Dominick "what did I do" cruz
Cruz does seem like he would be kind of an unlikeable prick in real life.
Cruz’ God Complex is leaking out of his ass….. this is golden content DC!
Bisping has a sore throat and is still super loud jeez lol
Wow I just wasted over 11 minutes of my time 👎👎👎👎👎
Need to add Khabib to this batch.
People who think this should’ve been done in private are probably think Rogan was being mean to Schaub
The point Dom is missing is that he hurt DC and doesn't seem to care at all about that aspect. You can say you have your right to express your opinion and apologize for being hurtful at the same time, but this dude clearly can't. DC you should just recognize it for what it is: let Dom be a colleague and nothing more. People like him who choose to bring you down aren't really friends. He thinks it's "love". He thinks he can treat you the same way he would treat his child. How patronizing. It's an aspect of Dom that is disappointing for sure. No reason to hate him for it but again, it's relevant and disappointing.
This was great and everything should be in the public we care too
More please
I’m with DC on this one.
They argue like they’re married
Love this
I’ve heard it said that Cruz doesn’t have a lot of friends and is t the most liked guy in the gym so I can get why he doesn’t understand where dc is coming from. Just because it was said to you doesn’t give you the right take it public
I totally agree with DC you don't talk about your colleagues in public like that about something that could literally stain his career and the public perception of "your brother".   Dom is definitely a young man among matured men that clearly needs to grow and develop more.  He probably didn't intend to hurt DC but did and should realize it, apologize and grow from it instead of being defensive and a bit condescending to DC.
Dom is so self righteous. I’d keep my distance after that shit.
Bisping sent me here wat a guy 😂
Coming from the guy that said Conor was intentionally trying to gas Khabib out while Khabib was mauling him... LOL.   Cruz ks probably right in his take on DC. Idk those guys behind the scenes... and he admitted he's not perfect..   BUT.... it's funny that this is coming from him of all people 🤣
Dominick Cruz ego is too big that he doesn't understand what he did was wrong and it goes against bro. code. If you do not acknowledge that you are wrong, then you never know in your heart how messed up you are as a person. DC explained to him what he said concerning those remarks he made but he finds nothing wrong with them so he tried to play it off as though he never said anything wrong. Be honest or owned up to it and apology it is that simple. Instead of pretending and acting like you are THE man. People like Domini who thinks they're always telling the true even when everyone sees in their lies, are ones you are to be careful with because they are narcissistic & egotistical individual who never believe truly they're at fault. Even when they apologize,  it is force, it's not honest.
Can we get a podcast with you 3 please?
Dom just has a mamba mentality. Just like Kobe.  I’m not saying he’s right for going public with it because he shouldn’t have but his personality is that where if someone ask him a question or his opinion on something he’s going to be honest. Those type of personalities are intense and buttoned up with everything they and if you’re not that way it annoys them. Kobe was the same way with Shaq.  Dom has love for DC and that’s why he called him out
This is huge disrespect against DC , he is the best efter Joe Rogan, bad example of Dominic was in Khabib vs Connor when he was telling that Connor makes Khabib tired while Khabib was smashing Connor.  The thing with DC is he is kind and not diplomatic.
Love how Dom rips into him here. All love tho
this is one of the best videos
Hahahaha this is hilarious but I’m going to side with Daniel Cormier. Dominick Cruz commentary is kinda boring and always inaccurate saying mcgregor was tiring khabib out when khabib is ground and pounding the hell out of him
Tbh its not very friendly of Cruz to take this attitude as like i am miles ahead of you in commentary, even if he thinks he is
Just two mamas doing mama stuff.
Fk*n Dom ...can't let anybody finish what they're sayin'! ..and you better give him his glory 100% or he'll cry 😂😂
This was amaaaaazing 😂
This felt so behind the scenes and organic! I loved it!
I’m completely with DC. Dom put him on blast and he’s wrong for that. He’s allowed to have his opinions, but there are some things which are better said privately and not shared with the public. What Dom said affects DC’s credibility and makes him look bad, which isn’t fair.
All 3 are awesome, but DC, as in Dominick Cruz, is being pedantic… He is wrong..whether the media was going to publish it one way or another, it’s best not to bring up these things in front of the camera
This was honestly greattttt!!!
There funny as fuck😂👌🏼👍.
Hah y’all are great I’m happy you did this
Man I want to see an hour of dc and mike and Dom on check in with dc😂😂😂
This was by far the best interview I've watched!!
Didn't dom say Connor was gassing khabib from the bottom?
these 2 are annoying as hell, yep, I'm moving on - (before the incoming,, just scroll on by..),,,
Can this be a weekly thing
Daniel is like a crazy Democrat when confronted with facts he acts like you're the crazy one. Ask him about holding onto a towel for a championship fight and he calls Jon Jones the cheater LOL
Cruz is like, man fuck yall lol
this feel like a reality show 😭
DC commentary aside, I agree Dom was out of place to publically criticize his peer in the way he did.
It's takes a fully fed Daniel Cormier + A biased Bisping to match a weight cutting Dominic Cruz 😬😬😬  The confusion because DC does watch film but whilst eating popcorn 🍿 hence doesn't take notes of the details!  There. Problem solved.
God Dominic, is such a punk
Michael bisping’s old man laugh is getting better and better!
Imagine if this is 3 ladies/ women having this conversation. I swear they would have spit in each other face.
I live that Cruz has a fight in two days and is taking every step to keep his heart rate low... and managed to get himself into this tricky situation
I think the only comment that was out of line was the "He just likes to get his money and get out" thing. Yes you're entitled to opinions but that's kind of telling DC how he feels about his own career. I feel like maybe Dominic senses that other analysts like DC don't have the same passion and expectations of an analyst as he does. He sets the bar high for himself and he's calling out others that he feels don't hold themselves to the same standards.  On the contrary, DC needs to try and loosen up a bit and be less sensitive. We love you bro, no need to be so defensive!
I feel like doms just trolling him
This makes me want to throw Dominick around in a grappling match. He clearly took something personal that DC said and can't let it go. Dom needs a good Iowa beating, let me at him DC!!
Hilarious!!!  @daniel Dom makes a lot of slurps and his pronunciations are not the greatest. I agree with you that he is a bit dry and kinda boring but he does take it seriously and is a good analist!
The issue with Dom is that he put DC on blast publicly as a work colleague
DC forgets fighters names inside the octagon when interviewing them. He definitely doesn’t watch film
Dc vs Dc
Fighters turned interviewers is great content
IMO, Dom broke the bro code.    He's probably just testy because he has to make weight for his fight.  That was a Biatch move by Dominic.
A middleweight a heavyweight and a bantamweight  walk into a bar
Three Legends ... two being high ranking GOAT contenders.  This convo is too funny
Greatest piece of content on the internet today!! Classic
Dc´s chair is da real mvp
Cruz is pathetic and I have personally never enjoyed watching while his commentating. He probably is not happy with cormier taking over some of his jobs.
This was hella entertaining DC
dc commentary is faaaaaar better than cruz, even felder is better than cruz. only person worse than cruz on commentary is brendan fitzgerald that guy insufferable.
They gotta get these 3 every pre show and fill em up with all types of drugs and let's see em do some game and shoeies
Dom will NEVER apologize if he thinks he’s right.  never.
I thought dom was joking at first lol. Prime example why you should never overshare things with coworkers. DC is a cool dude most people would've used it against dom. glad he this sit down with him to educate him. unlike the others commentators though dom is still a fighter so I can see it from that perspective but to publicly throw DC under the bus like that is kind of a low blow.
I agree with the professional courtesy and think Cruz is ignoring or overlooking that fact, but at the same time, I think the public loves to see these behind the scenes, drama. This was really entertaining to watch!
Dom being slick w it :))
Cruz is so petty. Go away with your weird fight style and bitterness
Olympic gold medalist ???
Dom Cruz says he's not dry but we have almost 12 straight minutes of him doing so 🤣 He's very technical and binary, can't really relate to the nuance of what he said that has DC upset
If you guys want some actual criticism:  DC: you’re always trying to show off your knowledge by predicting whats going to happen instead of calling what’s happening  Dom: you talk from a place of ego so you’re serving yourself more than the audience
I dont know why but cruz is so toxic
DC vs DC let’s gooo😂
Cruz is starting to sound like he’s taken 1 too many punches to his head.
Haha I love Cruz, he takes no prisoners!!
Make this a show right now
For what it's worth I prefer D.C over Dominick cause I enjoy the sense of humor vs the dry and boring commentary from Cruz. And when he says something I feel like he thinks he's right and everyone else is wrong like he knows exactly what the fighters are thinking and the other guys don't. He feels pretty highly of himself and it shows and in the adult world it's anoying. Specially when it's as dry as a popcorn fart. Joe, D.C and Michael are funny and cool personalities. Cruz is in the same UFC comentar status as Tito Ortiz and Steve Smith
WOW!!! this was legendary
5 years 1 win and he thinks hes a title contender. delusional. all fighters in the top 10 would destroy cruz.
This is amazing 😂
DC is annoying tbh
Dc vs dc
Cruz is a weasel! Not cool man, if you have a problem with your colleague you should confront them privately, not air it out publicly.
Someone get Dom a J, dudes ready to pounce. Calm down brother
Dom is being a lil brat
Dom is screwed up for that. That is some back stabbing crap.
This has made me lose a lot of respect for Dominick. If you have a problem with a friend, you address it privately not publicly. I appreciate that they're able to stay cool at the end of it, though. That's what been a true man is all about
here from bispings channel
unscripted, as real as it gets
Yeah I agree with DC. Dominick was out of pocket for this one. Dominick should have known that even though he was trying to provide constructive criticism to DC, the media would twist it to be negative and that it would make DC look bad. You dont do that to friends.  And on top of that, tough love stuff like that should be done in private.
God I could never stand Cruz he always has excuses and complaining about everything
Hogging popcorn, forgetting fighters name!!! I'm on Cruz's side
Dominicks arrogance is why hes at the places hes at. Alcohol and cigarettes 🙄
Dominick cruz is the greatest heavyweight of all time trapped in a bantamweights body.
Dom is completely missing the point, if you are friends and you love each other as much as you claim to you don’t go out and say the things he said in public. you say it to your friend in private.
saying cormier doesn't watch film is wild though man lmao. the double champ is well-prepared every time out
i like how dom analysis of pedro
DC you're in the wrong. You're usually wrong. Do you homework stop stuffing your face.
i hope there isn't real beef.....lol. jokes aside, anik, cormier, and cruz are my fave announcing team. no yelling and screaming, just great analysis.
Prelims Cruz should better watch out before double champ DC chokes him out.
It is funny that world class athletes have the same issues that people like me have.  Arguing at work about silly things like this!
Best thing I saw this week.
Man I love this trio!  Bisping: il pick you up and throw you trough the window you little bastard 😂
Excellent content. I’m totally on DC’s side. Cruz is toxic. You don’t say that publicly. He’s also boring and dry as hell. DC is one of my favorite announcers in any sport. It’s shocking to me that Cruz doesn’t understand the entertainment aspect, asking why do I have to do that? That’s 90% of the job, being charismatic.
Dom is an arrogant clown 🤡.  Overrated fighter and boring commentator. Bisping mentioned on his BYM Podcast that Dom legit thinks he could be beat him in a fight, when Bisping is twice his size 🤣
I loved this 😂
Loved this video lol. Media really likes to stir the pot. These guys are brothers and nothing will break their friendship
Dominic Cruz commentary is like his fighting style......a stick up his butt.
the one eye bisp was sent there bcs the guys back on the camera were afraid they will going to fight for real. u fkin cowards. yeah it may have end like that, bcs both had precedent . we can figure that
I hope Cruz get's knocked out and then DC comes to interview him.
Hope cruz looses after this 😐
Cruz and Rogan are best pair.. Cruz talk like analyst and Rogan listens to him between rounds while something happens then Rogan takes over the shouting stuff.. ohhhhhhhhhhhh he slept him.. he slept him...
DC is right he’s as dry as the Phoenix Desert in July
A little lack of respect in my opinion on Dom's part. Colleagues should address their concerns with the other person privately. But I'm just a metal guitarist, what do I know?  Lol.
Cruz is such a unprofessional snitch man unbeliebeable.
This made my day😂
This weight cut has dom acting funny.
Dominick Cruz is making no sense
Have never watched any of these ever before, except for this one.  Thanks DC!  And uh... DC!
Cormier is bae goals.. dad bod😍
Cruz looking like some disrespectful angsty highschool kid arguing with the teach after class. Then Bisping comes in as the PE coach or something to really connect with the student and help DC get to Dom and make the conversation more upbeat.
Totally think DC is right here - courtesy and respect is everything but good luck convincing Dom haha.   That said, I think this might be one of the greatest things to happen to this channel because it was entertaining and revealing. At least now people have two sides and they can judge for themselves, I'm sure there will be people that side with Dom and that's their prerogative.
I agree with DC here, ie. professional courtesy. Don't call out your shit in public
If i have to choose my fav commentator, it would be: Anik Rogan & DC All the respect to every commentators out there, UFC has the best in the business. For me DC respects everyone, even the haters, and that makes me even respect DC more. I also look up to him, he is a very good example to all growing athletes and just everyone as a person too. Hope to see u even more in the future💪🏻
Its hard to believe dom was a champion in mma and one of the greatest to ever do it. He's a right snowflake
Dominick did wrong making those comments to the media
3 Champ's in 3 weight class !!! Brutal video let's go CHAMP!!!👌🦾🦾💪💪💯
Props to DC’s chair, for hanging in there!
I love Dominic Cruz but he is showing his judgmental and hideous self-righteous side. He does not set the standards of commentating! That's not holding someone accountable; it is called professional ash* know-it all.  The yardstick is the audience; Not HIM! He just digged a hole for himself and a distraction for the fight.  I will be looking for him to be Koed on Saturday!
Cruz will never understand this.  He's a Vulcan.
Lol “maybe not watching film works for you” “You can barely sit through the meetings” Lol Dom still clapping at him.
Yea he adds sodium to it alright by making as dry as burger kings original chicken sandwich
Im with cruz with this one lol this is funny though, they’re both funny
Beware: lots of DC bootlickers here
the thing about the claim Dom made is those are some critques that could possibly get your friend fired or looked at in a certain light sort of like how herb dean is lowkey on the verge of losing his job off comments made constantly
I'm here from Micheal Bisping's channel, Hi there DC subd
Best episode is always with Cruz
Just settle it in the octagon…
Lmaoo i love dom ,got no chill
Dom you're not wrong for having an opinion but because you made it public about a friend and Co worker that you have a good relationship with. Making your opinion public as a respected figure of the sport you put it in people's minds that DC is poor at his job. People listen to and respect your opinion. Not only that but when DC brings you on his channel to kindly clarify and maybe soften what you said, you not only stick to your statements but you also critisise his work ethics even further. I hope you and DC can continue to have a good relationship but know you've added a permanent scar. Now I'm going to flame you😈🔥🔥🔥  Dominick Cruz makes Karen seem like a well adjusted individual. Dom doesn't ask to the see the manager he immediatley calls his lawyer. Dom denying being dry was the driest thing he could've said. Dom denying being dry is like the sun denying being hot. Dom has gotten every waiter thats ever waited on him fired. 😁😂🤣  Reply you're best Dominick Cruz Jokes !
Cruz being that type of guy commenting mcgregor is tiring khabib by getting his face punched in and than disrespecting DC publicly about bad commenting
I love this. This is what the whole world needs. People need to be called out and then it needs to get talked over. That’s how everyone grows as a person
Lol Bisping seems like he had a few brown pops before barging in and he made it an even better segment
Dom is that 1 friend in high school that would call you out on everything in front of all your homies lol. He’s a sav
I love ❤ it friendship mexico 🇲🇽
Dom is right, DC's commentary is like a fight companion podcast and it's especially bad when he's paired with Rogan.
cruz is a bit of an ass :( stuff like this could cost cormier his job and future $. no empathy for DC at all.
I think Dom shouldn't say DC doesn't watch film publicly. It could affect someone's employment/reputation. Also ppl will not want to work with Dom if he criticizes them publicly on opinion.
Best pre fight hyyyyyype ever
DC does a great job, we appreciate you.
This was money……love watching these guys keepin it real…..huge fan of all 3 of them……beats watching the crap on TV
I swear this is the truth. Before this conversation took place I was thinking how lucky UFC fans were to have these 3 as commentators for this sport. Football, baseball and basketball doesn't have this quality all the time. These 3 are all great and enjoyable to listen to.
It sucks to be honest and it hurts to be real.
This is sad. Dom is about to have a fight and DC can't do his job because his feelings are so hurt. DC needs to check himself.
Turns out, Dom is a tool…
It's your need to podcast in the middle of a fight instead of calling it. Love your wrestling knowledge tho but like when you said Bobby green is the only one shoulder rolling, I'm like Dustin is one of the best at too dude. Just one example. Listen to Jack Slack if you wanna learn how to analyze fighters and fights
Cormier is right. Cruz talks way too much. You don't criticise your colleagues in such a manner unless you're out to hurt them. Cruz has the biggest mouth in the UFC, but he is partially right about Cormier's lack of effort. Cormier is also increible biased, and his commentary shows it. It's a hustle.
Love it DC
Actually this was hilarous :D DC was absolutely right tho.
"Hey, Di Ci, Di Ci, look bratha look, your chair is "wiggle, wiggle, wiggle," it's ganna break, be carful bratha, too much tiramisu nat good for your health, you old guy now, you have to take care of your retired."
DC is right…If it’s about accountability and love then say it to my face, not in a news conference…and Dom is dry….
Great vid. 3 of my fav old school fighters being candid af. You guys should get together more often.
Cormier does detail how the hell can he not watch fights haha
Dom is the type of guy who smile at your face and backstab you when the opportunity presents itself
Aye uncle dc my brother,I'm from cape town and saw what you said on uncle  micheal bisping channel....I don't want to spread the word but that money would do some good in a students pocket....truly love you as a person and as a fighter....I just wanna maul everybody...please tap in to my bank account🤣🤣🤣
Dominick.  Please stop being a pain in the ass.
After watching this I realize Cory sandhagen and Cruz talk the exact same way. Like there voice and cadence
Aaeee...a new subscriber here from Bisbing's channel..❤️
lol "accountability is love". bitch, hold him accountable privately, don't put him on blast in front of everybody! that shit is unprofessional. good to see DC call him out. michael bisping is the king for getting in there and trying to mediate.
Dom won’t commentate again with DC… he’ll be the fight night guy
I love how someone actually ran to get Michael Bisbing lmaooo
Comier you’re hurt. Go home
I can't stand Dominic Cruz fighting style. I can't stand him as a commentator. The guy thinks his shit don't stink. D.C is a great analyst. I was hoping D.C would pick him up and bodyslam Cruz into china.
Cruz, 10-7
I smiled throughout the entire vid
Dom did disrespect you DC.. Professional courtesy, never discredit one of your own.
Cruz is insufferable
The fact that Dominick “He’s stopping punches with his face” Cruz saying DC commentary is bad is ironic
Dom's panties are too tight; he should size up. The guy needs to relax.
DC needed to check cruz.
I'm on Cormiers side - there are unwritten rules on social etiquette with off the record comments. But not surprised at all by Cruz's actions lol he's so calculated and analytical. Amazing content, I wish it went longer.
Cruz is an oddball. He's missing the point here. And I get the feel he's an egomaniac who not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.
Let’s go Suge Knight
This is like Timon and pumbaa fighting over which bug is juicer
Dom is def in the wrong here, I would be hurt too if I was dc
Dominic Cruz … criticize in private praise in public.  That is just part of being a good colleague but even more importantly being a good person.
Wtf?
At first i was on Doms side.... after this video i am completely with DC on this one.
There's different perspectives going on that Cruz is misunderstanding. Yes, in general social environments your opinion isn't wrong and you can have these kind of talks. But as a professional, specifically when talking to media, you should not bad mouth your colleagues. Unless they have genuine problematic issues that should be called out like bigotry or corruption, etc.
MORE of this DC !
Cruz comes off as a child here
Haha hilarious. I must admit Dom was wrong. He's influencing public opinion of DC when he could just state is personal and incorrect opinion to DC personally.
Dominic is wrong here! Dominic, you don't make the rule!
Bisping sent me over 😂
This criticism should have taken place behind close doors.
Real reasons why Cruz commentary sucks. He’s dry, he comes off as very condescending and arrogant, even with all the “research” he does he gets things wrong, he can completely bring down the mood during commentary.  He’s not good for brand new fans, his commentary is only good for hardcores who don’t really knock what they’re watching still.  I always know what I’m watching and why they do it so having guys like DC or Bisping is perfect. I don’t need some arrogant condescending prick of a voice throwing useless information at me.
this is just pure cringe.... did Triple C set this up?
I agree Dom probably shouldn’t have said that to the media, but something else to consider is he is cutting weight for a big fight and is very likely grumpy and wouldn’t admit he was wrong here now.
Besides being a great fighter this is why I love Cruz.
Haha this is super entertaining. Just point the camera at them and it will be good content.
Dom is pound for pound best speaker in mma
I like DC alot more but I don't think Cruz did nothing wrong just holding you to a higher standard cuz both are  UFC Goat.
Man this is GOLD.  Dom is freaking smart, insightful and a great analyst. He's also...he's got a bit of a....angle or side to him that is confrontational...he's very comfortable with a degree of honesty, the most people choose to leave unaddressed. IT's funny to watch these 3 interact.  I agree with DC and personally would never do what Dom did directly as he did it. Now, I'd raz him or make a joke...making the same point but not nearly as head on as Dom does and did.  How great is this entire interaction. I don't think Dom frequently goes to the affirmation and love communication as he did in the Q n A, which makes this all possiible, preferring more frequently to "confront". LOL.  I love UFC and MMA !!!
Love how they're able to have a mature discussion and discuss their differing opinions in a (somewhat) civil way 🤣
DC has to be easily 250 lbs in this interview....its all good though champ you have earned it!
A real b*tchmove from Cruz. Hes also delusional and super cocky
Combine Bisping and Cormier's IQ's and it equals Cruz's.  The guy is dead on and by far the best MMA analyst there is.  Glad he spoke his mind.  There ain't two sets of rules for when it's fair to levy negative feedback.  Cruz is the next coming of Christ.  Amen to his beautiful soul.
Dom is a sociopath
😂😂😂
Cruz is right, accountability is love. If he didn't care about him he wouldn't want him to do better. And he does need to do better. Dc doesn't put the work in and Dom is just letting him know what everyone else is thinking.
I can’t wait for chael to tell two completely unrelated stories about this
People fall into cruz therapy questions lol trying to explain themselves to him, giving him more to lick at
Cruz’s defensiveness speaks volumes here… it’s not about what he thinks, it’s about being smart enough to know that if you say it to the press they’re going to print only the bad parts (as was acknowledged). This would’ve been so much cooler if he just admitted he screwed up and just apologized instead of going on and on about his truths and acting like he didn’t cause a situation
Dom has always been a hater.
DC has a this "Detail" show and he sonds like he is lost in there compared to the way Dom can put a fight, nevermind that, a single punch thrown from a figher into a microscope and distilled it for you as if you where watching a cinematic film.  DC pays to get this research done, Dom just called him on that.  What's wrong with that?  DC's ego is through roof man.
DC did DC dirty man
Cruz is fucking hilarious
5:24 He contradicted himself said you don’t need to defend if it’s true, proceeds to defend that he’s not dry. 🤦‍♂️
DC will beat the living shit out of Cruz!
If you have a problem with a friend you air it out privately to guard their reputation---period.   Cruz crossed the line.
Bro DC can absolutely rip Cruz apart.....  But hats off for him to stay patient throughout the whole idiotic statement
Bas Rutter was the best commentator and analyst. He even analyzes during the fight. My favorite one was when he knew Gomi kept going after Luiz Azeredo body to trick him with head shot. He called it. I think people should recognize him as being the best. Even one of the best fighters of his time.
I like this. This is real life. We are all the same n go through the same shit. Nothing wrong with having your opinion and sometimes we misinterpret others
The first 3-min 🙌🏽 🙌🏽 👌🏽 😝
Cruz was wrong for doing that..Hope he figures it out
Lost a lot of respect for Dom over this. Used to get whacked back in the day for shit like this. He basically said he's bad at his job and should be replaced. IN PUBLIC. If you think that's acceptable to do to a colleague and friend in public, idk what to say to you
Dom is super salty and I don’t know how people just aren’t seeing past that. Regardless how you feel about DC’s commentary, Cruz has most likely had to endure a lot more criticism than what he’s been used to for over a decade in his last several fights. Just a product of a very smart fighter having the sport pass him by somewhat? I’m sure it hurts to have your friends/commentators call your fights and not see every single thing the same way you do. But he should have come to DC man to man. Not in front of the media.
Dominic Cruz is very stubborn and has had a really bad attitude since losing to Cejudo. Just because you're telling the truth, doesn't mean you should blast someone with the truth.
Daniel isn’t mad… but set up a 1 on 1 interview in front of a wrestling mat to confront Cruz lol
DC, we all know you're lazy now and the retired life fits you well. Maybe ease off on actual fighters and just admit your decline has been faster than any other ex champ? If you leave the honesty there, no one will come after you.   You are lazy. You don't show up. All your teammates like Khabib know this and you think they are joking lmao. Just be real bro
This is hella sus
Dominick uncovered DC, honestly,DC is not real in his comments,he had his favorites in fights that he comentate,Not prefesionali,Many more fighters agree what Dominic said.Love or hate it its fact DC
Damn, DC is sensitive as shit. If he watched more vids, maybe his commentary would be better.  It's needed.
DC didn't make his point, it's because they're friends and you lift eachother up, don't break eachother down and potentially hurt eachothers carreer. Doms being stubborn
Dom knows what he's doing lol
Cruz was wrong for going to the extent he did. Straight up! New sub...love u Cormier!! You have such a good sense of humor and u are a killa too!
Dom is such a bellend. Coming from the "Conor is tiring khabib out by getting punched in the face" guy. Have a day off dom.
Call me biased, but DC is correct. Saying things like that in public can ultimately cost DC money. You can't play with another mans livelihood like that. Even if he didn't mean it that way, it comes off like DC isn't doing his job. Not cool Dom.
Good stuff!
Cruz is wrong.. There's a thing you can't say to public and media. We all are allow to have an opinion but all opinion doesn't need to say to publicly. In fact Cruz believe he's right everytime all the time ( Conor take punch to the face to gas out Khabib)
Dom is annoying
Dom seems like in his head he's never wrong. He knows what he knows he knows what he doesn't know but he doesn't know what he doesn't know 🤔 and he won't listen ...🤣 Blindspots Dom blindspots
I thoroughly enjoy DC’s Commentating. Not cool what Cruz said, I also enjoy Doms commentating, I think you guys work great together, GREAT CHANNEL DC‼️👊👊 Vinny 🇺🇸
Dom's the man he is because he over analyzes and hes a perfectionist... next point Dom is dry but it's entertaining
DC talks about MMA fighters (critically) every week but gets butthurt when someone talks about him? Always liked DC as a fighter but as a person he's always had a massive ego and has reacted badly when criticised (reference his multiple year grudge with JJ because JJ said he could take him down (as banter)).
This sums cruz up:  Bisping - “ I don’t think there’s a right or wrong here” Cruz - “agreed I’m not wrong”
This was a dangerous conversation to have during a weight cut. Cruz looks so on edge right now.
this was truly amazing to watch these 3 mainstays in the commentary space. we’ve never gotten to see them interact like this.
DC is the worst commentator lol
You have your shaq, charles and kenny here... All you need is ernie so you can have "inside the mma"... It will be fun...
Cruz take that plug out your hole buddy....
Cruz is somewhat right about Cormier’s commentary. Cormier is very good when he breaks down grappling transitions and fighters’ mentalities, but he also tends to be forgetful, biased, and often treats the commentary position like a podcast. When Rogan and Cormier are together, they’ll have random, comical conversations for several minutes that do not relate with the fights in front of them. The Blachowicz Adesanya card was a perfect example of extremely lackluster commentary. Cruz is definitely more professional and informative than Cormier at times, but it was harsh of him to openly criticize Cormier, considering the media was going to run with the negative aspects of his commentary opinion.
Dom shouldn’t have said what he said but then we wouldn’t have been gifted this amazing sit down 😂💀Bisping is fucking great!!😂 Just a circle of KILLERS having a talk and a good time.
DC can't handle being called out on his short comings. He's trying to demand Cruz think his way. DC sensitive 😂 Dom on different level
I agree, Cruz is a bit dry. Dc can forget people's names at times.
Im with cruz on this one. Hes as real as it gets
Dom fr got detention lmfao
By far Dom is the worst on the commentary team and also by far the least  entertaining would rather hear no one talking then his comments
Said this on Bispings channel as well, but this incident made me lose a ton of respect for Dominick Cruz. You are not a friend if you go in public and speak like that. Then he gets here and acts like he doesn’t understand what he did.
There's only one DC, sorry Dom
Dom C is a bad bro.
Pathetic Dom
Who fucking cares? Is this really important enough to make a video about? Poor bruised egos.....
Did his boy bad here, all gd bein a mouth when you know the big man dc will look bad for smashing him!! Great viewing ahahah  bisping as the peace maker is hilarious 😂🏃‍♂️🥇
Cruz is quite Pecker-like .
Love all 3 of these lads! Would be happy to see more frank discussions just these 3!
Dom woulda really got beat up if they weren’t coworkers 😭
The people taking this serious are insane, this is the funniest ufc content I have seen in a long long time and seeing DC actually explaining Cruz's Kneepick was hilarious. They're both so childish 😭💜
Loved it! 🤣😂🤣
"I love you, now here's me trashing your skills at calling fights. I won't even say you suck at your job, I'll just imply it". Cruz could get under any skin on the planet. LMAO
I really hate Cruz. too smug, hope he gets knocked out…again
Dominic Cruz is insufferable
DC nailed it
Cruz = woman behaviour  Victim to suspect 😂
Bisping sent me here to subscribe to THE NATTY GOAT  we love u DC
This was awesome
also Dom have this kinda of "teenager" vibe that i really dislike. hope he gets rekt next saturday, get humbled.
We love you D.C.
Michael bisping !!!!!
"you don't believe you're dry?" "no" "dominick cruuuuz"  lmao  5:35
Dominick jumped on the Cormier Hate wagon. A complete backstabber.
Cruz is being a bitch here. I hope he gets knocked out. And I've always been a fan. He is probably just salty becuz Cormier gets paid more than him and he thinks he is a better commentator. Which may be true but don't call your friend out publicly and be salty about it. Everyone knows commentating is part knowing what you are talking about and part being LIKABLE.
Cruz the type of friend who wont tell you your fly is open but goes on telling the whole school because accountability is ❤
All I got from this is that DC doesn't watch films. He really needs to go to the cinema.
DC is 100% right in this situation!.. Dom needs to apologise and stop making excuses!!....
Dom can argue with a brick wall
DC absolute class act. Cruz comes off as bitter and jealous. Everyone has different personalities and that provides a  great contrast and balance to the broadcast. Mike Goldberg was great but he barely knew the difference between a takedown and a knockout.
DoM was spitting straight up 100% facts lol
Bruh I could watch 5 hours of this
Dominic is a weasel for sure. You don’t “out” your “brothers” or friends like that. You pull them aside and have the conversation privately. This is how he feeds his family as a retired fighter currently. You don’t come between a man and his money, especially if he’s your  “friend”.
Accountability is the highest form of love?
I’m sorry for DC , cuz he stayed professional about it. I can tell it hurt his feelings from a colleague saying some hurtful remarks. I love Cruz , but that was a low blow.
DC with DC. Can't get more DCier than this.
Broo this is gold 😂 this should be a thing after every ppv 🤣🤣🤣
Dominick Crusless..
Dominik needs to worry about Pedro Muñoz and not DCs commentary
Dom may be better at X's & O's, but I'd rather hear Cormier or Bisping calling the fights
Yoooo 😂'' Why don't you just do some research on your commentary ?'' You gotta love Bisping 😆
We need more sh*t like this. Dope video honestly. If they started play grappling that would be even better
this is the f8ck1ing best video ever
Straight up snitchin
I love this lol
DC IS RIGHT
DC and Dom is a bunch of kids. very childish
DC, worst commentator I've heard. Just get better, rather than bitching bud
Dom's is such a good guy, but he gets easily fooled by his own words....
when is the Amanda interview coming out?
Damn dom is cutting weight and he is miserable. You can tell he’s on edge
That was fun 😂
The Count brought me here!
When cruz commentates it feels like he's competing with the other guys he is with to be honest.
Before all this situation, I always thought that DC is biased asf as a commentator. If we are in the circle of trust, DC is very insightful, but could be more professional, as far not being obviously biased
Ill give Dom feed back. You are as condescending AF
DC Vs DC 😂
So because he doesn't say the technical terms for things he's salty. First thing he brings up is his old fights. DC says hes dry and he takes it as what  he sucks at
Yes.  Dom should should have shared his criticisms privately with DC.  That would have been the proper thing to do from a professional stand point.
My opinion is that Cruz is wrong on all counts, and DC was clearly hurt by what he said. Cruz made a mistake saying that stuff, but it is what it is, and Cruz has to live with it now. I wouldn't mind, but DC is a great commentator.  What was Cruz THINKING!!!!???? lol
This pretty entertaining 😭
Dom is werid lol he doesn’t understand why DC would be upset cause he put him on Blast in public. If you’re friends don’t throw someone under the bus.
cruz giving me serious ryan renolds vibes
DC you need to monetize this channel!
Awesome D.C. I knew this conversation was going to happen as soon as I watched Dom's presser. I just didn't ever imagine we'd see it!!! Groundbreaking stuff!
Cruz is a psychopath. He wont get it. I love him on the commentary though.
Honestly Dom is just sour that DC didn't have biased commentary in his favor of the Cejudo ass whooping he got... DC commentary >>> Cruz commentary
Dom called DC out on his BS lmao 🤣😂 I love it.👍⭐❤️
5:54 Dom's commentary for the Conor/Khabib fight was absurd and still gets meme'd today.
DC need to grab a hold of that boy, and just give him a little glimpse of the power he doesn't possess. Cruz just being a dick.
I don't understand what Dom was talking about honestly. DC makes a great job, and the DC breakdowns are some of my favourite videos about mma.
That chair DC was on, is as tough as they come.  Didn't tap...  Next BMF contender?!
Lmao imagine walking into the therapist office and it's Bisping sitting there.
I'm here with the knob who dissed me in public DC is a great guy who wouldn't do what Dom did.Dom is suffering with weight cut and surely he wouldn't say this 🤔 or maybe it's just winding DC up to make his fight get more attention 🤔
I really think Dom believes he did nothing wrong but anything told in confidence or Job threatening traits being told publicly is not being loyal. If its criticism say it to them don't scream it from time square. Pretty simple example  I go on TV tomorrow and say my friend goes to the stripclub everyday instead of going to client meetings he said he has booked. No criticism more like snitching. If it bothers you and he is your friend tell him not the world.
5:58 is the best part of this interview. undertaker level of making an entrance 😂😂😂
this is real as hell
Can’t wait for dc to pump more liquid shit tier commentary this Sunday morning.   What a fudge dragon
Small guy syndrome
I’m with dom on this 1
Full of sensitive guys, it's just words
Dom is so annoying. So arrogant and pretentious and he ironically has said dumb shit while commenting countless times
Dom comes across seriously unlikeable and hard headed
I mean to be honest after years of watching UFC, I feel like most of the analysts are biased, as they are human. But I know this going into the fights and enjoy the commentary even if I disagree.   I believe even Joe Rogan said he mutes the commentary in order to correctly see the fights. It happens.   But I love all 3 of these guys.
DC handled this 100%. let's be honest. Dom is just not as entertaining and fun to listen to as DC. Dom may research more but he has about as much personality as a dictionary. DC is very likable, funny, he knows his stuff and that's why the UFC prefer him. Dom being jealous because he researches more and still no one likes him. Backstabbing his boys will make people dislike him even more, if that's even possible at this stage. Well done Dom!
Cruz's opinion is sincere but it doesn't help dc's career , in fact it hurts it a bit, so as a friend , it was wrong. Simple as.
More slash for the entertainment! I love the real talk thx DC
Grown man shit.
Dominic always keeps it real. DC, I know it's not what you wanted from the interview but it was a great video.
Cruz was all over the place...poor guy..i think he mad at the undefeated guy...hahaha...sad
You guys are awesome. I love the real conversation !!!!😀
Cruz is a weiner and has a small-man complex.  And DC is a baby.... love you DC
Dom is one of my favourite people in the history of MMA
You never call my fights fairly - Dominic "Josh Fabia" Cruz
They’re something wrong w dom. Like this was such an obviously bad move to come at your coworker in an interview. If I was dc I’d be done w this guy. He’s def just jealous of dc’s fake now and them grooming him into the main commentators and not dom.
Get rid of bisping terrible champion and complete snowflake
Bisping to the rescue
Man I love this, I was dying the whole time!
Dan I absolutely value your genius, highly experienced commentary, EVERYTIME. I couldn’t possibly disagree with Dom any more then I do.  With your knowledge and experience it’s not completely necessary to watch hours of films. Waste of time for a man of your skills and talents.  Brother, listen- keep doin you and you will continue to be one of the sports darlings. Thanks for your time in reading this.
Dom asks for feedback but can't accept it. I agree with DC that you don't publicly air that sort of criticism in public. End of video he still acts bewildered.
Dc does tend to drop the ball a lot. Forgetting Sean Brady’s name is so bad. And he’s so bias when he’s calling fights
Daniel Cormier just so u know if u ever see this I’m on the side of the guy with the initials D.C .....and always will be 🙃
Dom scared
Cruz is just salty
Big rule of good relationships is praise in public and critic in private
Dom is living in his own world. What he did to DC was uncalled for. He actually bashed DC for what? For his own clout? Like the way DC dealt with it though. Showed maturity.
I think Dom is following the golden rule in that he's treating others how he'd want to be treated.  Just that's he's a maniac and doesn't care about things that other people care about so it can rub people the wrong way
This is not the first time Dominic Cruz is acting like he is above the rest and calls people out, Hans Molenkamp, Keith Peterson, now DC. Dominic Cruz is delusional in my eyes, he had no right to do what he did, and I wouldn't mind if some fighter puts him in check privatly. He crossed a line with his allegations about Peterson and for sure he crossed a line with DC. You have zero right to tell others what to do  and what not, and how to do it as well. This man is a douche and a prick and not half as smart or good in the cage as he thinks.
This was funny AF!😂
Dom is more dry then a piece of bread that's been in the sun for 100 years.  Can never be wrong and knows everything.   👎👎👎
Dom at his golden best! love it!!!
I don't remember to be that entertained watching some dudes bickering about their jobs before!
I wouldn’t be able to be friend with someone like Cruz…
you need diff personalities.  those 3 guys on screen in this video couldn't be more different.
Cruz had a bee in his bonnet going into this,he's a proper mardarse ,it really made me laugh how Mike jumped in and just laughed and wound Cruz up in doing so.
subbed in hopes on seeing more of that english bloke in the middle
Cormier and Rogan are very bias commentators. Dana is making sure they push who he wants to win. Just paid propaganda like most corporate mouthpieces.
When Dom commentates he only talks about himself...thats y O'Malley gna knock him out
Can tell that hurt dc feelings . Dom ain’t shit for those comments
To be fair DC’s Detail is the best analysis and content on ESPN.
I dont think he said he dont like when DC calls his fight but I may be wrong I just didnt hear it
This is fucking awesome...
This is quality entertainment
This is how real bro.s operate we fight we argue  But at end of the day we hug it out Good job gentleman 👏🏻👏🏻
DC i love you. So cute when you get defensive. i love it.
DC, that might’ve been uncomfortable, but it was good goddamn YouTube/Radio/Television. 👍🏼
Don’t buy it DC, he is a snake
The saddest part is CRUZ REALLY DONT UNDERSTAND how he was wrong 10000% ... He def a male karen and snitches on everything he sees lmaoo
That was hard to watch, Dominic is such a passive aggressive guy. That’s gross 🤮
Cruz is clearly not backing down…
I don't think Dom should have came out like this and put DC on blast. He's framing it like that's exactly what a true friend would do, but it isn't. A real friend would approach the issue in private, not in front of the whole MMA media conglomerate.
L
I would have no "interest" in friends like Cruz.  He wants to bust DC's balls in private that's one thing but Friends would not blast them like that in public, and during this interview he seems to feel like he did nothing wrong.
Criticizing DC's style is one thing, but saying he just wants to get paid and leave and doesnt care - that's not cool.
Doing this as Dom is cutting weight is bizarre
Just found out you had a channel DC! Glad I did. I feel like you handled this pretty well to be honest. Big fan!
Bit of a strange thing to say about your friend. What's going on here really ??
dom always came off as smart/clever arrogant , now is just arrogant
Yeah DC is obviously correct it’s workplace 101 to compliment in public and correct in private. Still hilarious though glad it happened lol
wtf is going on lol
Dom is a bad "friend".
DC > dom
I wanna see more Dom on this channel so I’m subscribing
DC is right, Dom was a prick for saying that in public.
Cruz just forgot he’s not a heavyweight it’s not his fault he thought he was supposed to be trash talking for his fight this weekend
Lowkey dom vs faber is my all time favorite rivalry all started by their first fight... if dom doesnt think DC has seen that he is insane and since dc has been a commentator he has always called cruz pretty well imo 🤷‍♂️
this is so uncomfortable to see lol
This can only be settled by roshambo
GLAD  you have a channel now DC , love your work and fights .
Believe DC was more upset it was done in public first without having that conversation privately, he wasnt as mad at what was said
DC Sucks.... he knows he was losing to Domm
You should thank him DC your channel is gonna pop off now with this drama
Bi*ch move dominic
Dominator in every aspect but Cruz shouldn't have done it public
Great hilarious 😂
LMAO THE TENSION
Mr bisp mediating shit must be bad 😂😂
Typical!! Dom and Jon are talking about DC behind his back for whatever reason!! Hating on him and trying to get him Fired out of Pure Jealousy!! Nothing else to See Hear!!
Dom is a shit starter and the other guys laugh it off because they had way better careers than him.
I gotta go with DC on this. I get where Cruz is trying to come from, but nah, it’s one of those things; inside the sanctum of a friendship, vs public. Huge difference.  Someone who says things to the public about a friend that shows you in a negative light, isn’t a friend for long. It’s loyalty, in my opinion.
Only one way to settle this.. catch weight
This is must see TV!!! What an awesome conversation!! Love Bisping hopping in too, the banter was too good!! Need to see you three on a card sometime soon!   100K OTW! That check mark gonna look nice! Keep up the great work Daniel!
This is fricken awesome, these guys are pure legends and comical!
I died when Dom goes, "sodium just sounds really good right now" lol
😂😂😂😂
I think Jones is enjoying all this drama around Cormier 😁
If anyone had done that to him he would cry for a year, he cried about someone wanting pictures taken with him for God sake acted like he'd committed a crime.
That weight cut has made Dom, lose his damn mind. Dude turned into “Karen”, You don’t watch film, where’s the manager? Here comes Bisping “the Manager”.
LMAO somebody had to call bisping to come in between thiz two
Dominick Cruz was trying to gas DC out with his counter questions
I love this 😂😂😂😂😂😂 3 champions
This is great content!
I'm sure DC has a lot of 'yes men' around him who tells him pretty lies, but I'm glad that Dominick told him the ugly truth because that's what a real friend does.
I don’t like DC.  I don’t know why but I think I could smash him.  With that said,  this was very very entertaining.
Disgraceful. He's one of the most experienced guys around and pretends he doesn't know how the media works, blaming them for him making a disgraceful statement. He's such a crybaby too and his commentary is so boring.
I generally like both of these guys, but Dom is being a total asshole here. DC is absolutely right in this situation. And for Dom to preach about accountability is pretty rich, considering he's the dude who said his ref was intoxicated after he got finished, and that Conor was trying to gas Khabib out by letting Khabib smash his face. Reminds me of that SpongeBob episode where Patrick says stupid people can't see their own stupidity 😂
Daniel snake Cruz
Dom is salty that he has to work harder than the other guys to do what they do
DC doing damage control... don't mess with Domm
Dominick Cruz is insufferable, he acts so damn smug and so unlikable…his commentary is absolutely the worst, the most exciting thing could be happening and he has the most monotone attitude ever. What Cruz did was just a blatant break of trust and he thinks okay because he’s just “expressing his feelings”.
There's a cage right there,fight it out.
All these idiots talking about who’s second best. Joe Rogan is the greatest analyst in sports
most embarassing part of this video. 5:35 dc doubles down on calling dom dry and the laughs about it like its so clear how could dom not realise? what even is that? isn't it exaclty what DC has an issue with what dom did public criticism?
Daniel cormier is right, you know media wil use this so you can blame him .. cmon its your friend and colleague
Dc is to sensitive. The truth hurts sometimes.
Dom should just not talk shit
Awesome Video fellas!
Dc we are sick off ur bias commentary i would put u on mute also plus cruz is so Right hes not the only person thinks that of u we as fans also think that before cruz even said it
Cruz has become really bitter over the years. We had his silly comments over Khabib's perfect record. And now this. He was openly contentious.  He didn't want to hear DC's suggestions about his dry commentary. But yet he wants to criticize DC's commentary...  DC made all this genuine effort to be respectful, and Cruz was just like "K..." Cruz just keeps trying to poke at him, and be kinda shitty.
DC is right. Keep that kind of stuff between you and your friend/colleagues, going public is out of line. Accountability isn't going to the press about someone, it's about telling them personally.
“Conor is trying to tire khabib by letting khabib punch him in the face” - Dominick Cruz….cruz should never be complaining about anyone elses commentary.
"I was getting up"
“Dominic never had mayo in his life Cruz”
I actually just seen the Bisping video on this but this is nice to get a better before the beef feel hahaha they're both class acts
"sodium sounds good right now"
So good
Dom basically likes airing dirty laundry in the public instead of confronting the person face to face. Remember when he did the same to Hans from monster energy?
I think all of them are great on commentary. I couldn't believe they got rid of Mike Goldberg when they did because he was great. But now that they've put fighters on, they are much better at breaking down the action and explaining whats happening or whats about to happen
I need this line up weekly. Too funny. 😂
Dominick: “Alexa play no friends in the industry”
That was better than DC fighting
Just imagine no one knows about this and all they had to base an opinion off of was the initial interview of Dom Cruz. I thought DC was about to throw down, I was genuinely scared for Dom
"Sodium just sounds good right now"😂 poor guy
I love them all
I don’t like DC but he’s right. Dom might have crossed a bit of a line. You tell your buddy stuff like that face to face. Then again DC wouldn’t be so defensive if he wasn’t right.
I respect Dom Cruz as a fighter, but cannot stand him as a person. He's a narcissist who always thinks he's 100% right about everything, and it's pointless trying to argue with people like him.
Cant stand either one!
Daniel you're a awesome commentator🎙️🎧 keep up the good work. 🥊
cruz was trying to gas dc with his talking
Dominick has little man’s complex
Regardless of all this feedback, the fact of the matter is... Dom should have held himself accountable as a friend not to do DC like that publicly.
That Cruz personality is so unlikeable,  but its needed in some ways thats why he's a champion   that unflappable,  pro drive 💪
Before Bisping interjected: this is great.  After Bisping interjected: something happened in my pants...
I'll only root against Dominick Cruz from this point on...you don't read down your friends man.
This is fantastic
Dom...DOM! There are absolutely things you say in private that you should not say to public...WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT....Is there a mental illness there? Do you understand social norms or emotional norms?
CRUZ IS WRONG ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WHEN DEALING WITH SOMEONE ABOVE HIM ! CRUZ ISNT GOOD DEALING WITH PEOPLE ABOVE AND BETTER THEN HIMSELF HE HAS A LIL MAN COMPLEX! AND A MENTAL ISSUE IT SEEMS THIS ISNT THE 1ST NOR LAST TIME CRUZ WILL BE WRONG!
DC is right. It was a viscous public criticism
Everyone likes this style of video because that's what the basis used to be for YouTube, real videos from real people with no corporate influence.
Where did Dom get the idea that he is somehow responsible/authorized to hold  DC accountable for how he approaches his profession???  DC doesn’t work for Dom. As long as Dana and the UFC are pleased with his work, his opinion is meaningless.  Dom just needs to admit he was mad at how DC called his fights instead of characterizing DC as a bad and lazy analyst.
"You don't think your dry?" "Dominic Cruz"? lolol
Dc is the best commentator of all time period.
I think Dom did this publicly,  because he felt somehow slighted by DC and thought if he did it in private, DC would just dismiss him.  Totally agree with DC though,  doing this publicly is petty and vindictive. Some ex girlfriend shit.
Man I enjoyed this so much
It seemed to me that Cruz's behavior had been changing the whole video like a rollercoaster
The only one who sometimes speaks stupid things during the fight is dominic so i would have liked to turn the volume down a few times, for example in the khabib vs conor fight. I've never seen anything like that from DC, so Dominic keep snorting and concentrate on the fight, not that you get beaten up again.
Anybody else thinking this is the next big UFC show to come out on you tube.. these 3..
Absolute gold....how is there not a reality series with these 3!?
Dom just can't admit he's wrong here man. He broke bro code big time and he is continuing to try and argue his case.
Dominic Cruz lacks social awareness does he have Assburgers?
que buen contenido csm
No one else but dom thinks that about DC commentary.  I dont want a robot Wikipedia commentator....I want an intelligent fighters perspective who understands the fight game and knows the fighters
Wow being multi time world champions really doesn’t fix insecurities... I’m to to learn golf. Done with Bjj
Classic dom, I loved every second of this
Cruz go see the fight for Conor vs khabib and u will realize that you are clown 🤡, DC is very good commentator
Cruz is a hater when cruz is the best behind the desk,,,BUT D.C.brings a new flavor ,personality wise and DOUBLE champ? D.C. is GREAT in every way! Love D.C. cruz we could do without!!!
Cruz is absolutely correct. I don't even think DC went back and watched Jan vs Izzy closely even AFTER all the criticism he got for his biased commentary during that fight. He's also come out and said he thinks Jones beat Reyes. Clearly he either doesn't know what the hell he's looking at, or he just obviously doesn't have the time or care enough to watch fights back closely and objectively. It's almost certainly the latter, which is what Cruz is saying. I'm glad he said it publicly because it just confirmed many of the suspicions I had about DC already. The dude literally is looking at his phone every time they show the commentators during a fight.
I really liked DC commentary.  Joe and DC is my favorite duo for talking to the mike during fight
This is crazy; people love drama. Daniel’s channel has been stuck on 90k for a minute. After this whole drama jumps 4.5k. No wonder everybody trying to create big drama show.
Am I sensing a TUF season w you 2 as coaches?
Cormier doesn’t appear to be taking this well (even right before the video ended)
Dom is sensitive and heartless at the same time?????
Love how real both of you guys are!! This is how friends work sh$@ out!!
Yo DC good to see you have a channel dude,  thank the count saw on his channel 🙌
I love this hahahaha
Is Cruz supposed to be smart , cause that has to be the most idiot thing to do ever , if I was D.C. not only never talk to that scumbag but never work with his as well , you can say stupid stuff like that in private not in public.
“Just put me in the Middle East, I’ll solve all the problems!” Gotta love Bisping 😂
This was quality!
You got the Sub dc! lmao Dom is dry as hell. I personally love the jokes and the fun you and Mike bring. Dom gotta go call a soccer game or some shit lol
Cruz is hilarious. 😂🙏
Love your style DC, thank Michael Bisping for this sub and notification, also Dominic Cruz for the media drama. As long as people mention your name good or bad it helps. Love Cruz and his lack of filter if it’s on his mind it’s on his lips.
9:02 Dom's Bisping impersonation 🤣🤣
Cruzie 🥰
Lol these 3 really should have a full time show.
I love DC he is such a f legend
Whoever advised you secretly, he admonished you, and whoever advised you publicly, he exposed you, so if you want to warn people If there is a mistake or a defect, please warn them and only them privetly, and do not alert them in front of people.
this was the best interview ... more of this realness less generic questions. Hearing about the fights through media scrums get boring, at least this way theres an actual story
Let Fist speak!
Dominic Snitch Cruz 😂  Dom always salty about something.
Dominick likes to argue, almost  has much as DC.
Amazing. I love Dom
Dom comes off as a dick in this vid. Dude's tone of voice needs to be worked on. If you don't know who Don is, his dismissive and negative approach to simple criticism makes him look like a kid. Notice how he doesn't answer for his own accountability when asked about it and answers with equivalency of "NO YOU!". Dom already looks pissed at the beginning of the vid. A childish argument Dom makes is "well, I have an opinion" as if only Dom has that right. 🙄
Classic Dom getting awkward and argumentative straight off the bat.
Dom fighting prelims and he ran yesterday's headlines. Nothing else to be said. That's how you promote a fight
You gotta love how brazen Cruz is! 😂🤣😂🤣😂 he does not care about feelings!
Who else subscribed after going to Bisping and hearing DC saying he paying subscribers
Doms a cranky weight cutter
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 hilarious. This should continue to be a mini series between DC and Dominic
he is right dom dc eats fuckn popcorn and wings it
Cruz claims his homework but said DC has an Olympic gold haha
Cruz said no lies at all. DC is there for the notoriety and the paycheck. Cruz just has a higher commitment to the commentary game than DC and he DC knows it. There was a time where Cruz only had commentary going on so he took the time to perfect it as a craft when he was injured. DC sees commentary as a secondary option and it shows.
The truth is that Cruz is a racist and he always has a problem with black people.  Its why I have never liked him. He is always trying to insult and argue with black fighters now his own boy. Watch him interview black fighters.  He's a prick!
DC...wrestling is the greatest sport in the world. Love your work man! Keep wrestling alive.
Holy shit this should be a podcast 😭
“You brown nosing son of a bitch” -Daniel Cormier to Mike Bisping
Would rather listen to DC than Cruz  How could anyone forget Dominicak said that Conor was gassing Khabib  by getting his face smashed lmao 🤣 Dom and Hardy can kick rocks
Love what you do DC! Truly one of the most inspirational guys in the sport, whether its fighting, commentary, or just being a good dude. Looking forward to you, Joe, and Anik commentating this weekend.
I really dislike Cruz's commentary. It's the same approach each time and mirrors his fighting ideology. Obstinate self belief. It's my opinion, so it's right and I'll say it. Saying he turns DC is evidently an insult. Funny video though.
Bisping sent me DC. Subscribed
Bitch fiiiiiight 😂
This reminds me of couple’s therapy with Bispin as the marriage counselor 🤪
10:04 Dominic says DC is an olympic gold medalist which is not true at all. Maybe Dominic needs to watch more film before he accuses others. What he said was absolutely distasteful about DC. I wouldn't have appriciated that also if I were DC, some comments are meant to be private.
If you want to have an opinion. Go for it.  If you want a colleague to change then talk to *them* instead of insulting them in public.  That'll achieve nothing but resentment from your colleague.  DC is such a good sport for keeping up with Cruz's obnoxiousness.
A podcast with them 3 would be insane
Get rid of DC and bring back Dan Hardy
Wow DC is very emotional and defensive.
Both of them are bad as commentators… DC is just worst 😂
DC is a shit commentator
I seen buddies hashing it out 🤝
These 3 right here should have a once a week podcast
These guys should do a podcast together  lol
Do this every week please
Never change DC! My girlfriend doesn’t give a fuck about fighting but she loves your commentary.
Holy crap this devolved so quickly lmao
I totally back DC, you keep it professional, you keep it private with your colleagues, especially if you're bros. I also agree that Cruz that also happens to be DC, is a "bit" Dry which he nicely worded meaning Boring.
Both these guys suck
How is DC gonna get good at video games if he has to waste all his time watching the damn early prelims.....
Great body language here. DC constantly trying to get affirmation from Dominic... He's constantly in his space...😂😂
Dom lost when he wouldn't admit he's dry
Joe rogan still goated at commentating
Ever since Daniel compared Cruz's fighting style to someone else's,  Dom has been salty...
Hope DCs chair is getting paid well!
This is so funny :D love it !
Dominick is terrible I think it’s time for him to be out of commentating he always thinks he is in the right he the smartest which is wrong can’t stand his ego, he never accepts he is wrong even if it’s clear as Conor’s snapped ankle.
Lol this one was awesome 👏 👌
Cruz has the worst case of small man syndrome
Accountability is great BUT praise in public and criticize in private. With that being said, this was hilarious.😂 Love all 3 of you guys.
No reason for Dom to lie and if you’ve ever listened to DC and rogan for that matter, you can tell they barely know the fighters other than the main few fighters
DC the absolute legend.  💯
I love Dc’s interviews because he doesn’t sound Like an analyst
100% Entertainment
cruz is a tool, you don't question your colleague's professionalism in public
A wild mike bisping appears😂😂
More. Of. This.  DC is a regular dude and Dom is just one sharp opinionated dude. That being said, dom being so DOM about stuff is the issue.
Dom is in the wrong whether he wants to admit it or not
Dominick is right. Didn’t think I’d leave this agreeing with him, but he didn’t do anything wrong
I agree with Cruz. DC it's too worrying what people think about them. We all know that the media has no team but their own interest they are wolves in sheep's clothing.
Special years here!  What a crew......
Subbed
Far and away your best vid.
Some how I feel baited into watching a YouTube video.. Well played guys
This was fucking gold ! Haha
Let's go !
Cruz is a straight FEMALE
Dc is without a doubt more popular and likable at this stage in his career vs when he was an active fighter.
That was awesome
Bisping is a class act, lol it was getting a bit awkward and he definitely lightened the mood
DC is right, you don't do this to your colleague, that was dirty from Dom
Lol this goes in the top 5 best interviews of all time
😂😂😂 reminds me of our circle when we have "accountability" talks.....lol.... No one is right, no one is wrong, take what you can grow off of.... You all are great in your own rhyme.
Lol, it's like me and brother arguing, none of us give in & then Bisping shows up, haha, nice 🔥
Stop with the skinny jeans and the kids shoes Bisping. You're 40.
Dominic is batshit crazy and is salty as fuck
Dom: Im not dry DC & me: YOU’RE NOT DRY!?   Lmao!
The only reason dc got mad. He’s truth
By far the best thing I seen on YouTube mma
Wtf is this lmao
I recognize myself in Dominics way of acting and its a negative and selfish way of thinking when things dont go your way, its losers mindset blaming other people for your dissatisfaction. p.s. I don't like DC's commenting 9 out of 10 times but Dom is on another level  have a good day everybody. p.p.s. DC is biased AF
Fighter's hating on DC for real nothing wrong with the way he calling these fights he still in the gym's wit some of these guys it's ok for DC to have favorites we fans have favorites these guy's are haters 🥊🥊🥊
DC is the most biased commentator of all. He should be removed from UFC commentating and go get a job at cnn.
Dominick was shit while commentating Khabib v Connor lol
This was dope! Dom definitely needs to learn how to speak with the media, but that comes with time. This just proves why MMA is the only sport worth following! Great stuff, DC.
The funny part about this is that Dom from all commentators/analysts is the one criticizing DC. He’s one of the worst if not the worst commentators ever (Rose/Khabib) and many other fights where almost everything he said made no sense
Dominick is always such a diva, always so sassy. Even after it was “squashed” with TJ and Urijah, he would bad mouth them
3 Champs
I just don’t like how dom acts like he’s perfect yeah he says he’s not but actions speak louder than words unless your dom 😂😂
Dom is so fucking extra....kinda not digging it
DC is such a whiny crybaby.
dick move by Dom. I hope he sees the error of hes ways, but after this I don't think so.
Come on Dom, 10:05 calls DC an Olympic Gold medalist, not accurate, do some research Dom. Can't just show up and collect a paycheck.
And that’s why Cruz is on the prelims.
Yoooooooo 😂 bisping
“That is a blatant mistrust as a friend and as a colleague” -DC That’s the point that Dom is missing. It’s okay to have an opinion on it but you address that privately if he’s your friend, not publicly. Some people just don’t live by that code.
We all love bisping
DC: “Let’s set the camera and start rolling. Imma argue with this mf over what he said”  😂😂😂
That's the thing Cruz shouldn't say negative sht like that because that's the caption of someone's blog etc. It's like saying someone in your gym has a weakness and you publicly say "oh this person is weak here" same premise
DC, you can be right or happy ...
Did Dc win the gold medal at the Olympics?
Wasn’t Cruz the one that said Conor is tiring khabib out by letting him get smashed I love bisping dc even fielder Cruz is the one who always tries to be the smartest in the room which comes of ass arrogant his the joe buck of mma Cruz is dry as hell I don’t even think he has reacted to an incredible finish when I watch mma I want fun like bisping dc and joe rogan you don’t want to be plain like all the other mainstream sports commentators
Dom outs DC for not watching film then DC outs DC for not watching film…
Best video on this channel 👏 👌 DC please be more of analyst than comedian..Bisping is always on point the dumbest thing cruz ever said is conor was letting khabib hit him so khabib would get tired 😆 but since then Cruz has been good
i think what really hurt DC was the comment about him just wanting to take his money and go, implying he doesn't love the sport. which i think it's clear to see is not true.
Best video of all time
Hahahahaha
Dom is so dam smart I feel he can argue with the best of them
rip to doms legs. Pedro taking one home
Dom is a hater! But so is every fighter when the media doesn’t go their way. Rather watch a fight with DC at the table than dom any day. Maybe he’s just dehydrated
The fact the DC broke down Dom set up his shots was pure gold
I love how all these guys were UFC champions
Cruz sounds like a hole of a co-worker lol
I think we just stumbled into a nice 30 min show with thi trio
I prefer DC's commentary over Cruz any day.  Even off the cuff he's much better.  Also, to put your coworker on blast like this in public is indefensible.  You're a scumbag Cruz.  Also, is Cruz DC's boss?  Why is Cruz acting like it's his job to correct his peers?  Can't stand this little weasel.  You're on the prelims for a reason stud.
Somebody once told Dom he sounded smart and he believed it and ran with it. He is definitely articulate, but I don’t think he’s half as intelligent as he thinks he is.
Their chemistry is unmatched 🤣 literally DC vs DC
Dominick is never wrong 😤
For the love of God he is cutting weight
The whole thing was good but DC saying Dom was wrong for saying that publicly and Dom replying that “he’s wrong?” Was such an asshole reply.
This is awesome.  Letting it all out.  I haven't watched the whole video.  I'm a 1/4 into it. Hope they shake hands afterwards.  I enjoy both of them both when competing and commentating.
THIS IS GOLD!!!!!
hello Daniel
the year is 2030, daniel cormier has conor and khabib sit down to talk shit out just like this video
Dominick Cruz and Jordan Schlansky need to be filmed debating…anything
This is why Rogan is so successful. He doesn't talk about the same old bullshit.  This was amazing content
Response posted only here? Find all of it entertaining, & comes across genuine, but let’s call it what it is, a work, to help this channel get moving.
DC was butt hurt but he held it down, Cruz was wrong for saying all that in public. Saying negative things in a public forum about a friend is completely wrong, some things should stay private. Maybe Cruz don’t see DC the way he does, so it’s all business for him and not a friendship. DC is too nice to everyone, not everyone you show love to gonna show it back.
This is #1 bullshit.
DC even though you don't feel the need to explain your way of being in regards to commenting in the midst of the constant criticism, this video spoke volumes to people like me who are long time fans that know you are doing what you love at the best of your ability! love from Miami DC!
I. Love Cruz but I don't understand why he went after DC like he did. It's not like Cruz to do that.
Man I hate people like Dominick Cruz. Yeah asshole you didn't do nothing wrong, but there is just no reason for you to go and say that, especially to the media. What good is going to come out of that? How does that benefit anyone in anyway? But he's going to die on his sword cause "I didn't do anything wrong though!". Just going to play that shit down. Don't need no friends like Dominick Cruz, they just always want to argue and prove people wrong lmao.
Dom asking for them to talk shit to him too to make it fair
I do like Dom’s commentary but holy shit dude don’t call out your colleague publicly like that before having a conversation in private. It makes him extremely unlikeable.
Dominick Cruz is a waste-man.
Cruz is a little snake man that’s fucked up and DC is a sweet bear
Perfect!!
I appreciate that dom is combative with everyone he interacts with
Cormier needs to wake up. He ain’t “your friend” or “your brother”. The 135er knew what he was doing when he told that to the media. His fighting career is going downhill and he knows that he has to secure the commentator job for his future. DC does it because he loves it, Cruz does it because he needs it. He will backstab you if one of the commentator spot was in jeopardy. As a colleague, you do not expose your partners to the public, never unless you don’t want them there to begin with.
Gotta respect Dom here. He is the king of keeping the exact same energy.
This looks a little bit closer to the Pride interviews, and it's a good thing
Good talk.  Lmao, Dom is so f%##ing dry i cant listen to him at times.
This is correct they won't run "we are brothers" and for many fighters they did this, shown half comments of one fighter to other and very few fans actually know whole thing.
DC is totally in the right here was poor as fuk form from Cruz….  He is dry he has a sour view of the world and he talked massive shit knowing what would be the talking points from his quotes… not his first rodeo!!!  Took a massive L on this Cruz did!!!! DC Mike and Cruz are different but all good …. DC and Mike more so… cause they are entertaining and Cruz is all about technique and heavy analysis etc which is good but could be bit more entertaining etc
Dominick for as smart as he is is really dumb sometimes.
i think the problems fighters have is that thry dont call for pros but casuals
Oh no, dom will lose because he was stupid to violate his own rule. Now he is distracted. Btw, dom was in the wrong. He threw dc under the bus
I was almost expecting DC to ankle pick Dominic in the second minute .
Do public comments like that put colleagues job on the line and as a friend or "brother" is that wrong? DC obviously was hurt by it and Dom didn't acknowledge that.
Well, the positive is that it brought some attention to you. :)  I appreciate Dominick as a fighter and a commenter, but it is almost like he is a robot or something....lol.  He can't seem to understand why he is wrong.  There are some things that are for private and some things that can be public.  Lets say for instance Dominick is cheating on his girlfriend and you say, Dom that is wrong, stop being a scumbag (in a loving way of course.)  Just because you said it to his face, doesn't mean you should share that will millions.  BTW, I think all 3 of you are great and I hope you guys (especially Dom) learn to appreciate each other,  and not bring them down.  Oh, finally you were guilty of what Dom did as well with Sergio Mora.  He might not be a friend, but you shouldn't have went into him either, it isn't being professional.
I understand where Cruz is coming but i do think that there's a time and a place for everything. He aired out some dirty laundry in public which was better off said behind closed doors. DC handled that situation better than i would've. Aside from that, it was wholesome seeing them being real.
I love how quickly this went downhill in the sense that they kinda started bickering like siblings.
Dominick Cruz just mad the UFC muted his commentary
Love dc but Cruz is very well spoken and an incredible
If only dc and the count  and thug nose will combine their shows and have one place for mma podcast.... I think it will millions of plays
That was hilarious
This is great 😭
When you’re heavyweight champion you can touch someone while talking as many times as you want and they won’t say anything.
Hahaha damn, this was pretty awesome content, i feel like you need both type of commentators as a fan, someone like Dc and Dominik are peanut butter and jelly
Dominick cruz is easily the best analyst in this room. Daniel is so sensitive and the truth hurts. Micheal bisping sucks too. Guy does the daniel cormier when daniel cant make it
Bro this was juicy af, be honest y’all set this up 😂!
Love it!!! Lol
Cruz always comes across as someone who thinks he's better or smarter than everyone. I've never really liked him. He's being childish and maybe a bit jealous of DC's attention. He could find himself in Dan Hardy's shoes. It could be on purpose to get his own platform after.
Popcorn anyone? im all out
Cruz is and has always been a dbag! Cruz personality sucks! He definitely one of those kids that had to learn to fight because he was getting beat up all the time! He must of got picked on alot because he turned into a great fighter!! Although his personality sucks! And he is dry AF!!!!
I like DC & Cruz but Dom was messed up for this. Dude complains about everything now...
We are brothers and I love you. See that speeding bus?
The gas out Khabib line though
amazing job going out and doing this right away after doms comments DC!! genius work keep it up
No disrespect to RC or Harrington, but if DC and Bisping hosted a podcast, it would have the largest viewership for any mma podcast ever.
Lollllllllll DC - YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE DRY?!!
Fantastic!! just Fantastic, so much fun
Daniel is not good in commentary. Plain and simple. The guy is a kiss ass. Who loves all guys instead of speaking facts
Man I love these guys! They make the sport better
Dom will never admit to how extremely fuckin stupid he is. He’s out in 1 round.
So much for keeping the heart rate low.
This is the definition of you could cut the tension with a knife.
“We need one guy to keep it real” And I’m sorry Dom.. that will never be you 😂
Na Dom is the fuckin worst.
Dom full of 💩💩💩
OMG Cruz is such a brat! I don't really agree or disagree with his opinion about DC but he's acting like a spoiled kid in principal's office after his rich dad shows up!
Cruz broke the Bro Code!
The UFC will punish Dominic Cruz for going public like this.
Dom is the worst
How did DC not say “you say underhook 5 million times in a fight”
I love this hahaha
Weirdest beef no one asked for
When Cruz is commentating he makes me want to sleep
the truth is all three of those analysts are the fucking best besides JRE ofc
9:37 ????
Wow I was wondering if they would discuss the film watching slam, got to it immediately. DC is correct about the friend angle (friends don't blast each other publicly) but so is Dominic Cruz (criticism of a media colleague's media performance is permissible)
5:58 Surprise Michael Bisping appearance
This was awesome real man!
respect to both of em for publicly disagreeing with each other and still having the maturity to carry on with the interview
I like Cruz but he comes across as such an asshole in this clip. I feel like he knows he's in the wrong but is too proud to admit it. It's unprofessional to disparage your colleagues.
Great Content! 3 Legends
They bicker like husband and wife and Bisping is the marriage counsellor.
That was wrong of Dom saying that in the public, you don't potentially sabotage the job of a friend. It's more a game of words at this point rather than whos right or wrong and you'll never beat Cruz at that, well unless you're Bisping really lol. But I think DC handled it well, a lesser man would've exploded here haha, couldve listened all day
Praise in public, reprimand in private.  No matter how "real" Dom is keeping it, anything negative should be discussed out of the public eye. The press looks for the drama, as they stated, no mention from the press on the positive things he said about DC.  Just glad to see they all get along.
My God this guy Cruz is so annoying and stubborn.. You literally shitted on your so called friend that you say you love.. Cruz will never admit he is wrong.. Maybe he was bullied as a kid lol..Anyways you did Dc dirty.. Slimy guy…I know dudes like you and I can’t stand being around them.. Looks like Dc had enough right at the end and was like I need to leave or else I will turn him into a pretzel..
Love it :D
Dammmj!!!!! Cruz putting him on blast... .
Dc isn’t going anywhere he’s the best at those fight breakdowns
Hahahaha
Dom def dry. Prefer bisping or dc for sure
Was def fucked up of Dominic. Dom low key wants DC commentator spot and the I’ll do anything to get it.
I dunno man, to me, dom is acting like a typical defensive brat. He basically told media that he thinks DC is a phony who doesn’t do his job and then is like “what, I’m not allowed to say how I feel?” And then has the nerve to talk about accountability lol
It was wrong of dom to say it
He came at dc sideways
Cruz is dry bruh
This is amazing
Dom such a lej on the mic haha
Dom is out of touch with the reality of working for a company. Wheter he's right or wrong, wheter that leads to a better prepared DC or not, he just shouldn't have said what he said in public. I wouldn't be surprised if the UFC gets rid of Dom for that now that he just advertised himself as a liability.
Dc just wanted to be right as usual.  The biased commentary is one thing but how hard he tried to avoid real talk and taking ownership of his paying commentary enhancing thugs was embarrassing.  DC should have just offered Dom some scratch to be his commentary coach and played it off as a joke,instead we got where a good example of how the phrase "mansplaining" came to be..
6:17 🤣   7:23 DC and Bisping have good energy man!  DC, btw we all have that one friend who doesn’t get it! 🤣🤣
“Olympic Gold Medalist” 🤣🤣🤣
Dom was totally wrong and disrespectful
Cruz is juiced with testosterone man he needs to get into the octagon ASAP haha
There is nothing but love here that shit will pass its nothing
That was entertaining af
2 of the baddest men on the planet meet face to face and act like civil human beings. Awesome guys!!!! Such a huge fan of you both!
😂
damn cruz not holding any punches lol, doing DC dirty!
It’s like watching two brothers bicker over the last hot wing…this is great. Time to wrestle.
this was good, while d cruz might have had a point about dc not doing enough research for fights he calls, i am happy dc called him out for saying it out in public rather than talking about it in private first.
Very cool dudes.
I’m with Dom.
The fact that DC said "step punch punch" lmao this is exactly what Cruz is talking about dude just winging it 😂
DC CHECK IN WITH THIS BOI 😂😂
Dom is a shit person. Rem when he exposed Michael bisbings eye after Bisbing made fun of his height. This guy has no loyalty.
Wow dom. I couldn’t argue wit bra we just go have to fight fuck it
The irony in this is DC is the one with the show DETAIL..which is all about him watching tape and going over it in detail.  😅
Daniel “The reality is” Cormier
This is why u dont trust yt ppl at work
If Bisping Didn’t come I think we were gonna see A free PPV 😅🤣
Daniel cormier hands speak more than thousand words.
Dc is a better commentator hands down
After Dom throwing that jab in his press conference this has to happen
Dom trying to spicy: *SODIUM*
Props DC going head to head with a word smith and tricky minded Dom!! I would never.
Sounds like Dom is a little sucked out and angry 😠
Asshole move by Dom saying that in public. Should have been a private conversation. "I appreciate you as an analyst" and also "I mute DC when he talks" lmao
After cruz loss to Cody ppl praised him for having great humility. But the Henry loss has legitimately messed this dude’s head up. He is very spiteful and really (on camera) hasn’t been happy since.
This was hilarious 😂
Wait, so you sat him down almost immediately after his comments, so you guys can sit, and clear the air? Like grown ups?   Please send this blueprint to EVERYONE
I can't tell if this video was supposed to only break down the fight or to intentionally start an argument and go off the rails to entertain us😂
Man they must do a podcast together they are like impaulsive but old gen
I understand what Dom is saying, but DC has a lot more ammo he could have used against Dom. I dont think he would have liked it if DC mentioned that Doms career was likely over, and he's been relegated to the undercard
Legit took them 30 seconds to start arguing 😂😂😂
This was absolutely brilliant. Thank you for sharing this. You all need to be on the same card after this
This is gold!
DC is right. Critique between colleagues should be a private conversation.
DC should just sit on this dude.
"I'll pick you up ya little basterd and I'll throw you threw the window"~bisping
This was fun actually. Props to DC for not getting all butt hurt and going off on Dom on twitter. Real men here. Talk it out.... even though they all agreed to disagree 🤣
We all love you DC, but you can never accept being even a little wrong.
9:02 🤣😂
Dom Cruz could get into an argument in an empty room. based manlet
I see Hate between these two. Lol
This is my dream work space
just kiss already lmao you guys are like rampage and shannon
Glad to see it but how about be a fuckin man Cruz and go talk to him face to face dont put shit out in the media like a fuckin worm. You guys both work for the same Org a Org that made you rich anf gave you the opportunities that you have to be a fighter and an analyst.Dont be a snake and act like your holding him accountable by using the media. Hows that look for the UFC when they see a fan Fav like DC Announcing and now they think he dont know what he's talking about. Shit fuckin move dude hate to see the UFC get caught up in your petty drama because you wasnt man enough to tell him something to his face. Bitch move end of story, acting like the media done it when you gave them the ammunition to start shit. Dana should fire your ass dude, you brought heart in the UFC but I can see what kinda man you are out of the ring a fuckin WORM!!!
Yes accountability is love but Doms not his dad and second there’s definitely a better way to convey that message or could at the very least told DC what he thought before he said it in an interview so DC wasn’t caught off guard
😂😂😂 yea him and dom need to do this more often.
Isn't Cruz the dude that said Conor was wearing Khabib out when Conor was getting smeshed? Then DC tells him he's dry and he fires back with I add sodium? 😂 I agree 100% with DC, if that's your friend and colleague, you wanna say it in private ok, but you're trying to mess with dudes job at this point.
Isn't Cruz the dude that said Conor was wearing Khabib out when Conor was getting smeshed?
Dom always thinks he is right, no matter if God sends angels to tell him is wrong 😇. Arguing with Dom is damm, he is a sore loser.
You're the man DC! Keep up the good work 👊🏼
Tf happened to dom. When did he become so defensive and bitter.
I can’t stand dom man
Dom should have not done it via media but pvt cause its a bitch way of going about things
Cruz is 100% wrong here. Should have spoken to DC privately.
Point after point after point Dom  was correct.  He can share his opinion to the media...you know same as DC shared his opinion TO THE MEDIA on (FRIEND) Justin like a week ago. He' is being very hypocritical here all because Dom was a dick... what's new He says dickhead things alot .
I do agree with Dom and I don't like DC very much, but i gotta respect DC for the way he handled this
This is the commentary team we need
Great content
This was so funny! I love your relationships lol
10-8 Dom
Would have been great if you all didn't talk over each other. Hard to pick out a word.  Too had as it would have been great to listen in on the convo
Wow amazing!!!!! More and more stuff like this
I’d love to see all three of them commentate at the same time. Probably would be educational and hilarious lol
Dom bro.... Be careful what you say to your future boss.... 😂😂😂
These two are opposites in Chinese astrology. Blatantly obvious ha
Cruz comes across douchy
The bromance is real
This is hysterical
Dom through him under the bus on live t.v. dom is monotone and boring  rogan anik and dc best combo
This is hilarious
cruz acts a bit like a narc at all times. This was the same guy who was saying "conor is trying to gas khabib out and make him get tired", when conor was being ground and pounded to pulp. Cruz def watched a lot of conors film. DC is brilliant at in fight analysis and what the fighters next step is going to be in the midst of the chaos. The man literally calls a submission two steps before it happens. Hes earned the right to eat cheese puffs and pop corn and get drunk while live on air Cruz. ahahahahah relax its fight nerves . You should focus on munhoz coz that man is a monster
Nah I'm with DC on this one, and I think he's being as nice as he possibly can be about it.   Whatever truth there may be to that accusation (and I do use the word "accusation") it's something that could potentially take food out of his kids' mouths. It's perfectly acceptable for a brother to tell you *privately* that you need to up your game, and honestly I appreciate that kind of honesty, but to put someone on blast publicly over things that are *central* to their career is unnecessary and if he could drop his defensive, condescending tone for one second I think he'd realise that.  I don't think Dominick even intended harm, he just didn't think things through.
DC is wack at media. It’s not for him. So obvious that he’s chasing money
“You don’t think you’re dry????” Lmao dom said “I add sodium”.
Dom would be the worst grandpa. He's not even 40 but already acts like a 80 year old cranky prick. Just look at his facial expression during this video
Dom is way to critical. You have to love him and his experience but look how he bos and weaves through the conversation.
Loved every minute of this! 😂😂 This trio is golden 😅🙌🏽
since faber isnt fighting dom needs to bully someone else now lmao
that was a great watch
Dc you did put yourself at the last weigh in show when you admitted that you hadn’t even done your fight research for the card yet. (The weigh in show is the day before the fights)
How does DC need to do any homework ? He is the homework!!!
Cruz comes off as a douchebag even if this is a skit.   DC was a superior fighter in every way and also a superior ringside analyst in every way.
Awesome
Lol this is hilarious need to make more videos together
This was great.
This was amazing, loved it 😂 great laughs. And Mike is a national treasure
That was the most hilarious and uncomfortable interview I’ve seen in a while.
Corner I'd the new king of cringe  Cringiest man Alice
Listening to Cruz speak makes my ears bleed. Guy is moody like a teenage girl
Seriously thought all of you are amazing comentator
Love the way Dom holds him accountable
Open weight
In the end, it was good that they were being authentic. Dom seems to be a very intuitive guy and DC is a very smart man. DC wears his emotions on his sleeves and is what lead to this discussion. I am glad they had this conversation.
two bias af commentator. lol.
DC: You're dry.  Cruz: But I add sodium!   🤔?!
This is the podcast/show we actually want and need.
If Cruz got nothing nice to say then he needs to keep his mouth shut. That was way out line wat he said as to imply that he's soo much better of a commentator than D.C that he doesn't even listen to him just Mutes him 😒 thats messed up I agree wit DC.  But Cruz thinks he's better n smarter than everyone n he likes to throw that out there from time to time in a suttle way like he did with DC and though he got called on it he still doesn't see or want to accept it n reps arguing his point as always n DC saw it was pointless to keep trying to explain to him and his " wat, I can't have my opinion" ooohhh stfu and stick your opinion up yours DC is a Legend in the Octagon and on the Mic bottom line.
Three former world champions in one interview
Don’t forget Dan Hardy. So smart when it comes to breaking down a fight. His fight breakdowns are proof of it. But you guys are all good analysts
I love how real this is. Shout out u 3
"Guys, I was sent to mediate."  Has this happened before?
Best Jerry Springer ever.
Greatest video EVER 🤣
Dom's ego is bruised about something DC said in one of his fights ... That's all this is . It's obvious watching this .
This is great hahahhah
This is fantastic. Thank you.
This is the best interview ever
Dude said Conor was getting ground and pounded to gas Khabib out.
I LOVED this conversation
2 sec in already arguing
I loved every second of this. You can tell that it's genuine especially from Doms side who wants to keep it professional. It's lile having that guy at work that doesn't put in the effort and no matter how much you tell him privately he still gets away with it. So, Dom's way of taking care of it is making it public and it ain't wrong cuz it comes from a place where you  care for the other guy aswell.
🤔✌💯❤    🌲🌲🌲👊🤣🇨🇦#UFC #1     YOUR NOT OLD!!!!!!****         after 65?  Sure 👍. Lol.
The best thing to happen to YouTube 😂😂😂
This was an absolute blast!
The Three Stooges 2021 Colorized
"Just put me in the Middle East. I would solve all the problems" - Bisping 😂
Bisping joining in was the funniest shit ever - Mike's a real one
Yesssssss
Petty sharpens petty
great fun! :D
Of course Dom was in the wrong here. He attacked DC's public image with those comments. If he cares about DC, he should've told in private all those comments.
DC gonna break that chair
Dan hardy is still the best analyst in the sport;-)
Doms took the first 2 rounds of the verbal exchange
These 3 need a podcast
he said he needs to keep calm during fight week... hahaha this definitely is raising blood pressure
Doms took the first 2 rounds of the verbal exchange
I don't know if there any Hunter x Hunter fans in here, but I feel Dominick Cruz is the closest thing we can get to a real-life Pariston Hill.
This is so awesome hahahah
Dominick mad because DC took his job
Watching the guy who claims our referee was drunk because he got finished talk about accountability is f****** hilarious
I can see where Dom is coming from, but critiquing your fellow commentary colleague like that in public. Is not a good look on Dom, makes him seem butthurt or jealous
love this!
I like this big brother little brother love 🤣
Went from DC Checks-In to DC Checks Him lol
DC is a creep.
Cruz is the definition of a dude who wins debates without being correct
Good interview and everyone made pretty valid points. I definitely agree that some things shouldn't be said in public about a friend, close colleague, or a family member. Dominick Cruz definitely crossed that line and it made DC look like he's a lazy analyst/commentator, when he actually does a pretty solid job IMHO. Hopefully Dom doesn't get his Karma this weekend because of it.
This is gold!!
Three alphas walk into a room….. this as awesome!
I actually kinda agree with Cruz but he shouldn’t have said this publicly, perfectly ok to have the opinion but to voice it to the media which could be damaging to DC’s reputation is wrong to me
Man Dom it must be hell to be in a relationship with you lol 😂
Dog sounding like a dummy. “You love your kids so you hold them accountable.” Okay, but do you do it on national television or a 1 on 1 conversation. I love Dom but you dead wrong and you should just admit it instead of defending a point that makes no sense
3 OGs, you gotta love it 😂
Like two drunk dudes at a party
Two outspoken fighters have a heated interview and…….insert Bisping. Bwahaha!!! This is awesome!!!
Dom throwing straight down the middle; quick jabs and retreat. Leaving no time for DC to recover. DC getting frustrated by the pressure, looking for his shots. In a wild gesture Dom opens himself up completely! Seemingly asking for a beatdown. The Ref (All Nonsense Michael Bisping) comes in to save DC from the 'sodium' and peppered onslaught of Dominick Cruz.
🤣, 3 of the best mma commentators, hands down
Haha everyone’s coming at this from so many angle’s.   DC’s emotional, Dom’s a statue and Bisping’s lighting the place on fire 😂
This is why DC is loved, he unlike cracky don’t hide his faults with lies and lies he shows you and talks about it. Don’t be like cracky!
This was a massively entertaining back-and-forth in this room of Champions!  I get where they're all coming from, but I personally would try to have that conversation in private as opposed to saying it in a public setting with the media.  Your boys are your boys and you don't wanna cause them unnecessary drama, in my opinion.
😂
Best ufc skit ever.
I want to see dislike ratio
I stopped watching halfway through... I didn't want to get to the part where they have make-up sex.
The 3 Pisces swimming around in circles lol I did my research
DC smells like cigarettes and booze, Dom smells like a douche.
You lazy in a rush not bothered at all just want the money.   Let's wrap it up here guys.
Dom shifts his whole body back after dapping up DC lmao
11:33 minutes well spent!! What entertainment!!
Honestly that was wrong of Cruz, I mean come on man don't do your buddy's coworkers dirty, that shit gets people saying stupid talk. Cruz acting like a robot
Cruz is correct and DCs big ego will not allow him to see the truth. He is delusional and has been for a long, long time....you are delusional DC...Cruz is smart to point out the truth....DC can not handle it....grow up DC.
*eats popcorn intensely*
Damn Dom was about to start beating cormier. Cormier got trolled extra hard
Bisping with the shameless plug at the end subscribe to him 🤣
Dont get how dominic is prelims
Dominick is such a small man it hurts
Maybe Cormier isn’t that good of analyst , but i think he is better than Cruz. Cruz doesn’t offer much in my opinion. The research info goat is Anik.
Dom said Pedro Munhoz is a knockout artist.  In 16 UFC fights, Munhoz has 3 KO's.  Do your research Dom.
God I love these two
Cruz is DC accountability buddy!!
My parents held me accountable.  Doesn't mean they scolding me in public or in front of my friends.  🤣
Bisping farts @7:23 lol
Yo wtf is going on lmaoooo
DC is the man who will not keep things in his heart. He will express them out to clear them. A mark of a good soul.
There is a saying in my language that goes "The advice in the public is a shame". Dom should never have went public with that statement, especially the "mute" part.
From the comments u can understand that people like open and 'real' conversations, not the ones we usually get, prepared questions, fake emotions, etc
Dom's definitely a bit on the psychopath spectrum. He doesn't seem to grasp the idea of tact and discretion and not just saying what you think.
Amazing. Nothing better than seeing something come up then for it to immediately be resolved face to face
Gotta bring in Joe Rogan to settle this commentary debate 💪
Loved this
He’s so salty about everyone around his fights, lashes out at Keith Peterson, then DC for supposed bad commentary on his fights. Dom is just feeling left out cause his career is on the slide and he’ll never be a champ again
Dominick Cruz is not even close to being the best commentator
Two of the lamest ppl in the ufc.. By faaaaar
Cruz is defo in the wrong here , he can’t talk about parents showing love through criticism as what parents would lambast their child in public , especially considering dom did it on a platform and this is dcs job
Awesome. I like them being critical and honest
DC was never my friend.
DC is the man every video is entertaining
Dom only said what we all knew all along…. DC doesn’t do research
Lol that was amazing hahaha
Dominick is a bitter POS. That isn’t accountability, that’s criticism publicly about how much effort he thinks someone is putting into his role. He believes he’s completely righteous. I don’t know why people are saying this is an unbreakable friendship, the way DC leaves in the end it’s obvious he’s not impressed.
im 1:33 in and im wondering what im watching. i finish the video, i understand what im watching. family talking it out.  wholesome.
Dc my man I thought this was gon be a big bro session and as I kept watching, especially after bisping came along, Dom got ya just when he said "that's ur job" yea man u do lots of stuff altogether and u should accept that u can't be perfect doing everything as jobs. Pease, out.
Absolutely love Dom Cruz just tells it how it is and absolutely doesn’t give a fuck
bruh this is not an interview this is a pre fight conference. big daddy cormier bout to go towelgate 2.0 to fight cruz
I love you and your commentary DC. Don’t let Dom get to you, sometimes I think dom just likes to get under peoples skin. I have always found your commentary very detailed and specific, No other commentators have the boisterous personality of DC. Honestly kinda feel like Dom may be a little jealous of all the love UFC fans give adC
dom is just one of those friends lol
DC lying he don’t watch those damn fights, I don’t blame him though. 🤣🤣
Conor wants to gas Khabib out .. by taking all his punches on his face .. ego of Dominic .. is off the chart.
LMFAOOO dom really exposed DC.. Jon Jones is lovin watchin thissss 😂😂😂
Cruz walking a thin line. DC can literally eat him
I wish this went on for an hour
Stop trying to stress out someone that should be cutting weight
What's the point of watching all that film to then come up with...Conors tiring Khabib out...and why isn't he getting up... He used a lot of energy on that ground and pound...gtfoh lol
People will say it’s 3 years ago, well when you’re commentating then biggest fight the sport has ever seen and your bias is so obvious, people will hold you “accountable” for that. See what I did there? Cruz has a huge ego where he can’t see anything outside of his point of view, him being very articulate helps that when people call his shit out he slithers his way out of it like a snake. Don’t like him at all. What he did to DC on the interview in the public eye is %100 wrong and he should know not to do that in the public eye.
DC doesn’t need to watch film to prepare for a fight. Let’s be honest here
I didn’t think the video could get much better… and then Bisping enters the frame😂🙌🏽
Before we cast judgement it’s important to understand that we DON’T KNOW how many times Cruz has talked to DC about this. Without knowing that information, we can’t really say if what he said to the is justified or not.
10-8 Dominick Cruz
I’d take rogan, Cruz, bisping and anik all over DC and I truly believe they should go with bisping on the ppvs but they don’t because DC is double champ.
Bisping coming for the rescue to add a little bit of positivity and smile
Just watch the fights DC.
These 3 guys could kill you 🤧😂
One of the greatest pieces of mma media I've seen
Great trio!!!
Much luv DC,you’re a great role model
DC: let’s talk  Cruz:yeah let’s talk, do you watch film?  Dc: I choose to not answer this cuz I don’t have to. 2:40
I get tired of fighters hating on dc
Lol
A bit DRY....!!!! Man, I believe Cruz stuffed up as an fight  analyst when he was so one sided during " khabib vs Connors" fight...!! Cruz isn't Dry.....! His SUPER DRY..! His like the Sahara in the summer. Cringey, triangular shouldered, turtle headed, controversy starting worm.  You welcome D.C and the MMA world.🤷🏻‍♂️
Cruz was a touch out of line IMO...these things can be discussed outside of the camera and his criticism was a little scathing - if he had issues before from his last fights he should have brought it up sooner I think... I think DC can be a little off when it comes to unintentional bias maybe?...but he's a great analyst...as good as anyone else...he brings personality to the table...a great voice and a wealth of experience.👍
You can feel Daniel Cormeirs wholesomeness through the screen. Extremely likeable dude.
Ok mr Dominick " I swear he's trying to gas Khabib out" Cruz obviously you don't do your homework either.
Bisping and Dom video = me happier than watching Moreno win the belt, and that was one of my favourite moments in ufc history 😅 love this so much!
Cruz is incredibly irritating. THinks he's a lot smarter then he is.
Damn, that chair isn't doing any favors for how DC's ass and gut look hahaha. Thanks for this top tier content. More of this unhindered talk please.
You gotta be some type of socially inept dude to not understand why answering that question to the media in that manner is inappropriate. Also so condescending by comparing it to holding “your kids accountable”. DC is a 41/42 year old man. Not sure how Dom has any friends lol.
Lol DC is lazy. He prolly doesn’t watch fights
People saying he should have said this to him in private, maybe he already has in the past? Accountability is love!
Dom is gaslighting dc 😂😂😂
Man dom seems like hes hard to be friends with
Cruz opinion shows lack of professional respect to DC regardless of what he says is "love"
So awkward to watch that after what Cruz said about DC's commentary.
DC vs Dominic let's go ...
Jokes aside. DC is right, you don't give professional feedback to your colleague via press conference publicly. The fact that Dominic seems to brush it off as being "Honest" is him legitimizing discrediting his colleague in public. Smearing his reputation. It's nasty.
Three is company
Ty
this is why kids should learn to fight, see how both are so calm and they are arguing! lmao
One person is angry towards Rumi and says .. how can you agree with those two when they can not agree. Rumi says to the person .. I agree with you too ❤️
Dc’s is a better politician. Cruze is a pure force of nature
So good! 🤣
Love DC
I mute which ever announcer is calling the fight, and favoring one fighter.   I can't stand that crap watching a fight.
DC smelled like alcohol and cigarettes 😂
Conversation between brothers I love it
Dom was a total dick. first he says DC doesn't watch film w no proof whatsoever, says he doesn't call fights properly, and when DC asks him to explain how he calls fights, he mentions how he heard DC call HIS fight (2:58). so this whole time, it was about Cruz essentially, and not the way DC calls fights in general.   more importantly, why would you say this in public about someone you consider a 'brother'? potentially endangering his livelihood and income? anyone praising him for 'telling it like it is' is also a dick by association
They can be friends ect and that's all good, but Dom did an back handed and untrustworthy thing there as a friend to DC. He's very slick with his words and uses manipulative phrases to get out of having to take responsibility for doing something wrong to a friend.  I'm a Dom fan, but DC would never do him dirty like that and he knows it. hashtag team big DC over little DC.
I still dont understand how kevin lee fits in all of this?
Dom should have kept his mouth shut.  Not cool.
The first minute is so awkward. You could feel Cormiers anger through the screen.
Dc and his fake behaviour needs to be reduced
3 goats in 1 room
The media is wrong! They said I dont like your commentary! I DO! But only if I mute it. - Dom "The Dick" Nator.
Why the hell did DC touch Bispings leg at 9:43? ......
Any more love ❤️ with this group would be “dangerous”😂
Dom is quite the character, yikes, thought he was slightly more polite
Cruz is right. Cormier is upset because he got exposed.
Sound like a couple of school girls arguing
This is the content I love to see. Bisping showing up just makes it so much better.
Dude bisping just came in 😂😂
You know DC went and watched all off Dominics fights after that one.
im with DC. i would never criticize my kids nor parents in public. thats family. same with my best friend.  thats something we do  behind closed doors.
Dominick Cruz funny asf
Brilliant!!! 🤣 Cruz is a serious troll!
Dominic Cruz was out of line, a brother wouldn't say them things about DC that's snakey.
*the  biased commentator who said conor was gassing khabib out by taking ass whoopping from him, is now asking questions About DC's commentating abilities* *_and the most amusing part is that DC didn't even mentioned it here like a gentleman, which could easily be the number 1 bad side of cruz as a commentator_*  _age, injuries has taken a big toll on his health and also on his brain tbh, he's not that sharp nowdays as compared to before_ Funny world right?
They started from the beginning 😭😭
Dom is a dick. Very simple. It is my opinion, and I say it out of love and accountability.
Literally THE best clip. MORE MORE MORE of this!!!
🤣🤣🤣 I enjoyed this ....... I would pay to see bisping and Cruz go at it !
Dominic is wrong tho... He should know how the media interprets it and it costs DCs job.
this needs to be an hour long
Doesn’t DC do the ESPN+ breakdown show?
This interview/conversation will go down in MMA History. Love the crew. They're so good because they're different. Keep it up guys.
tf is that interview!? i wasn't there in Cruz era but i've whatched videos and i'm not disappointed 😂
Nobody:  Dom: I know he’s going to punch me, I know he’s going to kick me, I know he’s going to try and take me down, I know he will have to defend my take down.  I think that’s what you try and do ins fight 🤣
Dom is such a baby. He’s mad at DC because he called something negatively in his fight. Dom is a funny guy, but can’t take criticism.
as I said, Cruz is the GOAT
I would say Dom’s style is more “relaxed” or “easy-going” rather than dry. I really enjoy it, especially when he’s paired with Anik, who’s the opposite.
Forget DC & RC, we want DC & DC
So we forget how professional Dom was commenting Conor vs Khabib? It is worse than what DC did ever! Dom is the worst friend you can have, he goes public and doesn't talk in private about such stuff. He also doesn't realize that he can ruin someone's career by saying such stuff. Horrible human being, you don't want near you!
Dominick: I do appreciate your commentary (muted)
Daniel you're right Dom is wrong you don't do that in public If you don't criticize your teammates or colleagues in public you don't understand your name in public
DC vs dc
I'm definitely with DC on the courtesy of a friend and coworker. Correct in private congratulate in private. It's one of those golden rules. Dom doesn't mind the criticism in public, he feels it's ok to treat others how you want to be treated which is another golden rule. Different codes, good they can agree to disagree and move past it.
wow so cruz is right and Michael exposed him in a sense
This is legitimately some of the best behind the scenes mma related content ever
This was amazing. I love how upfront Cruz is. Such a fucking straight shooter.
Opinions have to be tactfully done in cases like this. You can say 100 nice things and have one negative, but the one negative gets put out there
Best interview all week!
I think Dom just can't cop criticism
Well said DC 👏 Dryminick is your colleague,  not your friend.
Hilarious.
I love this , it’s like watching my 70+year old Jewish mother bicker with her yenta friends
So Cruz is mad at how he did his fight lol I'm sry but Dom is a know it all and always has been and he is sarcastic and tries acting so confident when in reality he's not confident lol
DC you tell them.. he’s trying to destroy his commentary job. But DC is legit but sometimes makes mistakes.
He claims that's "friendships" . No, Dryminick Cruz, friends pull other friends to the sides. They don't trash them in public. He's insinuating that DC is Lazy
I mean no one knows mma quite like Dom and tbf I don't think it's necessary for them all to have his knowledge. Everyone brings something a bit different and the team overall is good
Bisping really helped 💀💀😂
Joe Rogan should be commentating this conversation 🤣
I feel sorry for doms wife man.. The guy thinks he is always right😂 he is that annoying friend who thinks he is always right about everything
cruz such a snake for shaming his friend publicly .  ''who made that rule'' men with dignity and honor did
“I add so much sodium and seasoning”
Cruz loves to over simplify things and talk in absolutes and abstracts. Dc just wants you to stop talking spicy about him to the cameras
Better than embedded
to be fair as a fan we prefer joe rogan with DC every fight card.  joe rogan is #1 for sure.  100%  after that id say probably chael dom and bisping are fan favorites.  dom is hella competitive.  When I heard what he had to say about every analyst I wasnt at all surprised.  idk why my man dc is at all surprised or concerned about doms criticisms.  dom criticizes thats what he does every time he speaks the style is his and we like it.  he is a bit boring sometimes during commentating.  bisping hasnt crossed from being a competitor to a fan yet and he picks fights on accident with fighters still during interviews or commentating XD.  its hilarious.  but we also want to see DC in every mma video he just makes it better. and theyre all huge fan favorites woudnt want to ever watch a ppv without at least a dom or dc commentating.
Dom just said what we were all thinking
He straight up brought him here just to grill him about some garbage. Dominick has every right to speak his mind DC IS A CRYBABY
I love that DC filmed and put this up, amazing content! I would imagine Dom is cutting weight and has the usual stress coming into fight week, I doubt he would say this publicly otherwise.
oLymPIc gOLd mEdaLiST ...my ass
Dominick has integrity
Cruz vs DC 10-8
All the goofs
cruz shouldn’t talk about commentary. He thought conor getting smashed was him trying to wear out khabib. Dc is good at commentary
DOM is wrong and he also shouldn't have spread misleading info to the public. DOM is being a bad friend and a douchbag.
Loved the open conversation and the fact that they kept it real with each other and had a genuine professional back and forth and they argued their opinions. Obviously DC took it as a bit of a low blow but addressed it very openly and without hard feelings. Much respect to all 3 of you guys!
I saw the video of Khabib and DC laughing at Cruz's commentary in Khabib vs McGregor fight. And I think Dom wants to hold DC accountability too about not watching fights which we have clearly seen him in calling in some of his recent fights.
DC is %100 right here, Dom while maybe right just did the equivalent of calling out a colleague Infront of the whole office. Funny though lmao
Also cruz is fucking boring commentator i always mute it when hes on.
Love this controlled chaos ✊🏽😆
Dominick Cruz has always been a snake 🐍 he says sneaky shit about people he doesn't like and he pretends he only do so because that's "friendships"
Dominick `two faced` Cruz.
Dom on Khabib vs Mcgregor commentary in round 2 around 2 minute mark.   Mcgregor is getting ragdolled and hammered and Dom says "Mcgregor is trying to make him gas out ..." Thankfully we had Rogan who said "No he is getting smashed and has no choice."   I lost faith on Dom that day. He is dry and boring .
I love Dominick Cruz's attitude 😅 he's always combative makes for good back and forth.
Am only half way thru the video and feel embarrassed. DC could have handled it better. Cruz was very rude its disgusting.  Feels like dc is holding back a lot.
Love you guys. You all are great commentators and we’re blessed to witness this.
Good lord.
This was epic, all we need was anik and Rogan and it’d be a video for the ages!!
that was actually really great.
I agree that was poor of Cruz to publicly say DC doesn't do homework and just wants to get paid and leave. Let's not forget Cruz was saying Conor was gassing out Khabib by being down and letting Khabib pound him. Cruz was saying Andrade can't have control over Rose in that position and very next second she slammed Rose and won by Slam KO. No one talks about that.
look at the bright side DC, at least you now have an interesting video on your channel..
OH MAN the pleasant surprise of Michael walking into all this lol
Dominick Cruz basically said DC is a llazy prima donna that's just collecting a check.  He couldn't be more wrong.
Cruz a lil snitch
cruz doesnt give a fuuuuuuckk lmfao
Dom is being willfully ignorant imo. Dom brings a lot more technical knowledge than DC, that's true, and that's his place. DC is way more entertaining than Dom and brings a lot more character to the role. The booth needs both types of commentator. The issue is, it is wrong to call him out in PUBLIC. Dom could have given his opinion in private. To say he appreciates him as an analyst in this chat but infront of the media he says he mutes DC makes no sense
DC: you said some things that hurt me and made me look bad.  Dom: i didn't say anything you didn't want me to say.   LOL, this dude is the ben shapiro of fighters. debate lord ass that can't admit when he's wrong.
Don is a full narcissist
This is class,DC finally found out🙏
350lb catchweight bout. DC v Dominic Cruz. Let’s get it done,
Dom has some pretty low levels of empathy, dude really likes to gas light people too. Love 'em as a fighter, but he has a lot to learn in emotional maturity. DC is right, IMO. Should have been a private affair.
DC needs to work on his commentary. Cruz isn't the first to call him out on it and he won't be the last. Many times DC will just focus on one fighter and ignore what the other one is doing. Needs to call better.
I'm here for this! 😄
True, Accountability is Love however in my opinion that should have been said in private.
So good. Dom needs a YouTube channel too.
The reality is this, a true friend wouldn't talk to the media about his friend like he did. And then blame it on the media when they cut it up how they did.
This shit was biblical.
I like Dom but I agree with DC. Why you gotta do your boy dirty like that? lol
Cruz is a hypocrite backstabber..
Lmao I heard Bisping say "I've been sent over to mediate" and lost my shit
Greatest piece of UFC media ever recorded 😂😂😂
Oh please, Dom is acting like a petty, passive aggressive teen. "What, I'm not allowed to have an opinion? I was just trying to hold u accountable".. Trying so hard to justify or pretend like what he said was no big deal. I'd love to see his reaction if D.C. did that to him out of no where. Regardless of why he did it or whether he's right or wrong - at the end of the day, he shouldn't have said it publicly if he's really a friend. DC is right.  If he really cared about his "brother", he would have told him privately. "Bro, I feel like u come of as unprepared, etc". Nope, he blindsided his "brother" by publicly critiquing him at a presser.
Dog is such a dork, what a great friend he is 🥴
❤
This is why I love the UFC. it’s unpredictable and unlike any other sport.
Best fight I've seen in the UFC for 2021 so much sportsmanship 👏 Good job fellas.  But on a serious note I love DC's commentary.  Cruz is ok, I remember when Cruz said  "Connor was trying to tire Khabib out" by taking a beatdown  lol.
Cruz is the guy that said conor is tiring khabib by getting his face bashed in 😂 Cruz is a hypocrite backstabber
Its strange how Dom took indirect shots at Khabib for saying Aldo is fighting for the money but publically disrespected a friend and legend in DC by saying he is in and out for the cash.
One of the best  I am hella laughing right now 😂
This was actually super entertaining to watch, i side with D.C. , I guess I can see where dom is coming from but it’s still a dick move to throw a friend under the bus like that
Hahahahahaha!!!!
I love both og them. DC has his style and Dominick is not dry!
This is gold ... 3 legends
Damn dom is annoying, just admit when your wrong and quit being so damn combative. Bro argues like a 15 year old
Interview format but this sounds like a buddy podcast lmao
I think I’m in dc side with this one .. weasel move by dom .. that’s like a coworker telling the media I suck at my job lol 😂… that’s definitely confrontation coming
The media did do Dom dirty. When I read what he supposedly said, it was like he took a shit on DC. When I actually heard what he said, it dint sound that bad.
Cruz never lose in term of talk
I could watch them all day! Please UFC make a realiTV for these personalities.
these three need a podcast together so bad, and why not throw chael in for good measure
If you asked Cruz who should replace dc he would say his own name guy wants your job fuck Dom Cruz. He was ready to fight hans for being a snake and he went and did the same thing to you he has no integrity in the tale end of his career
That was brilliant
This should be a 40 min video
Bro, if dc would’ve said conor is trying to gas khabib out when khabib was mauling conor you wouldn’t hear the end from cruz! Professional courtesy involves respect and a certain humble approach which a guy as deluded as dominick could never have, that’s why everyone in mma knows he’s avoidable at best and a nuisance for colleagues. The audacity to critique someone else’s commentary style when you screwed up so many times on the mic is laughable, and to think The ufc gave up on golberg or smith for the likes of cruz and florian
Lmaaaooooo bisping pops out of nowhere
Best pre fight media video to date!!!
Love you commentry DC don't listen to the bully lol
Love DC as a commentator feel like he's right behind Rogan. All I think of when I think of Dominic Cruz as a commentator is him saying Connor McGregor was trying to tire Khabib out by letting him punch him in the face 😂
Not sure why Dom thought he needed to critique DC publicly like that really......But he's an honest, open guy no doubt about that, and that is all good.
I love seeing how DC interacts with fighters he knows personally, from that Islam interview where him Islam and a random Khabib start bantering like no cameras were around to this interaction with Dom and a random Bisping where it looks like a couple of bantering guys at a bar who aren’t scared of each other and are alpha males that are friends. Candid stuff is gold 👍👍
This is why Cruz is on the prelims lol. Nobody likes him
Dc is 100% right on this one.  Dom strongly believes an analyst should work in the exact way that he does.  Reality is there are different style, and that is what people are paid for.  If we had three Doms on a broadcast It would be bad .   Dom mixed in with other styles is good.   DC is valued for his championship experience, not film research.  He uses his experience to bring insights of what we are seeing as an audience.  Dom is completely wrong to do that in public,  loses trust as a friend and colleague.  Both guys bring value though,
Dominick Cruz if fake!
you guys should start a podcast.
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen.
Bisping is just the best 👌🏿
This is just... 'chef's kiss'. I need a 2 hour Jack Slack reaction vid asap.
Facts - DC was smelling of cigarettes and alcohol the whole segment...🤣
You just sat down with two guys who want your job. Dom Cruz sucks at calling fights but is one of the best 135ers to ever do it. He should stick to fighting.
Parents hold accountability for their kids but DC isn't a kid? What a condescending analogy. The best advice is given privately. No need to embarass him on media day.
Two real dudes
I use to like Dom, and now after his conversation style is exposed as being fem🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️, I just don't know😅😅😭
Dominick was out of line.
U two had great points. Beautiful .
Love both of the fighters for what they bring to the table...but saying what Dom said in public, in MO it is not right.. Even when Dom said that he being accountable just like any parent to their kids, but dude that's not even right, no parents shows accountability in the public its something u do privately... U say this in person to DC make more sense but to say something like this in public ain't right...no way it shows "Accountability" PS - show must go own
It’s 100% Dominic’s responsibility to take into consideration how the media could cover what he says to them. That’s where he is wrong, not for saying how he feels, but he should’ve known that it wasn’t gonna be a good look for DC to say those things. As DC’s brother, he shouldn’t be allowing for that to happen to him. It’s just the day and age we live in where if you wanna express how you feel, you have to consider the outcomes.
D Cruze is a G!!!
Dom owned him on this one haha
Hahaha that was complete chaos
Cruz is such a hater. Never forget, he said Conor was wearing Khabib down with repeated strikes to his fists with his face. Zero credibility or self accountability. Instead of taking a L like a man, he said he smelled alcohol on the ref.
10:21 Dom the ultimate troll the final blow to dc
Why would anyone want to get into a verbal exchange with Dom lol. You will never ever win against this guy. Undefeated, never lost lol.
"It's accountability" omg Dom just not apologizing is so hilarious. Wrong of Dom to do it but fuck like they both hit the button on what they do bad.
DC you have never had a bad video, but this one takes the cake brother
yo dc you need to change these thumbnails champ
Damn Dom is coming in hot :D
cruz is insufferable, little man syndrome cant see how he could ever be in the fault or wrong for anything
DOM is an jerk 😂
I don't think dc needed to defend himself but the banter is appreciated. We know Dom likes to bust peoples balls. Probably not in good taste because it's gonna cause negative headlines.
So lads when are we getting the sit com!????
Are these guys drunk?
DC with W
"You don't think you're dry?"
This was amazing I love seeing this we don’t get enough content like this on fight week the thing about this is it just seems a little more real like less professional but more real no script ! Love it
3 minutes in this is hilarious
DC’s chair is holding on for dear life lol
I get the sense that Dom is extremely analytical as a person but sometimes external happenings that he's not aware of switch his mood. That leads to him having conversations like this. On top of that he can't see that sometimes he's wrong. Who knows maybe he's a bit on the spectrum.
Bro the uncles chilling at the family reunion I never had
This is pure magic.
3 extreme personalities debating together who all love the sport but knowing no matter what it's all in good fun is just amazing to see 👏
We need a bisping interview
Was so wrong of dom to say that shit publicly. Props to dc for not telling him to go f himself. Cruz extra dry this week from the weight cut and being under omalley
I'd rather fight Dom than have to argue with him. 😅
Real friends can have these conversations without friendship being affected.   This is class!
Do the homework DC, at LEAST, BARE MINIMUM, don't forget the athletes names...
I knew it would come to this  I like to watch all three of them
Dominick Cruz looks like he’s in the principle office trying to explain why he pulled the fire alarm   Bisping is like the cool guidance councillor lol
I could watch this all day!
I tell you what, since Cruz publicly  spoke about your lack of tape studying, you will find yourself watching a bit more. Which could about be a good thing for anybody.  Anyway, try to find appreciation in Dom's straightforwardness. He is the type you would want to speak during sensing sessions. Someone you can count on to speak his mind when asked, with barely any political correctness tact or consideration for one's feelings.
Dom's become such a bitter man
Maaan, this is quality entertainment
all great analyists. DCS grappling, Doms clear cut,  Bispings after fight commentary questions are the best
this deserves a million views at least lol.. this was awesome lol
Dom just doesnt know when to shut up
Whats dry?😂
Man i love this🤣
Dominick salty
Dom is right cormiers commentary has been atrocious for a good while hopefully this ego check from dom will make him a better commentator
DC 100% correct. Theres certain things u dont say about your colleagues on air.
the initial 2 minutes of this interview is indicative of how Dominic behaves whenever he is in a conversation whilst not commentating. Dominic is the type of person who constantly turns what others say and becomes combative and is very condescending.  Dominic innovated a type of footwork which pioneered mma movement.  However, that said, that is also his downfall.  being able to be innovative in one aspect does not mean your opinion or thoughts are the ONLY way,  if Dominic took the time to listen and appreciate what others may say not necessarily always agree means you grow and learn,  Having some intelligence does not mean you negate what anyone else has to say,  no person is on an island in terms of learning.  you learn from the shoulders of giants and take what you want.  the problem with Dominic is that he always thinks his way is the right way and that is a person that does not flourish and grown.  this very point will illustrate why he has been passed by and will lose in his upcoming fight.
This is just classic Dominick Cruz. Maybe to us it wasn’t right or the way we’d go about it. But dude is as real as they come. Never once shy’s away from saying his truth. Go watch his post fight presser after losing to Cody. He lays everything out there and hides from nothing. Sure I wouldn’t have publicly said this about a colleague, but to Dom it’s just him being real and saying how he feels. Some people are brutally honest and he’s one of them.
three of my favorite fighters all time sitting talking to each other
This was an authentic conversation. Love seeing DC in this setting just like when he’s talking to the Dagestanis. Cruz had a valid point but he should’ve had said it in private
This is the best!
Love that Bisping backed DC!!
Amazing interview 🔥
You guys are awesome
Dom is very unlikable
I'd be pissed if I was D.C too! Dominic is being a little c$ck
The only thing wrong with dc's commentary is his repeated use of 'oh my goodness' and 'holy smokes', we're not watching the Waltons dc, sounds like he's just come out of church
A weekly DC, Cruz, Bisping show is all we need to finally get over the loss of the DC and Helwani show.
Bisping joining this is gold😂😂
We're a minute in and they're already arguing... I love it.
"He's trying to gas DC out"
Cruz just likes to argument.. All his face offs and interview is the same personality.. Argumentative and unwilling to relent or give in
-The DC Chec- The MB Walk-In With Daniel Cormier and Dominick Cruz
Honestly dc exposed himself when he said he pays someone to watch fights for him
What Cruz did was a dick move.
This is ridiculous big time. Funny egos though.
Bit rich coming from Cruz who said Connor getting the ground and pound was him trying to tire Khabib out 😂😂😂😂
Dc you really are horrible and Dom had the guts to tell you what many are thinking.   Your to big to be a cry baby.
Lool
Who needs enemy when you have friends like Dominic curz
I love it DC watching you and Dominic Cruz talk was so awesome the chemistry between you two and then all of a sudden incomes Michael Bisping I had to pause the video to leave a comment I wish you would do more videos like this much respect double champ. 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Always thought Dom was the nicest guy In the ufc and extremely professional. This was a scum bag move. Why would you talk and behave like this to someone who you call a friend. Shocking!
These three need to team up and go after Joe Rogan for doing zero research -- he usually does comedy shows the night before the PPVs.
"Connor is trying to gas Khabib out"
As a brother and a colleague saying that in public is betrayal
Way to go to start an interview hahahaa!
This was legendary especially when Bisping enters the room don’t be scared to vlog you just kicking it with ufc guys we like that shit
bisping so unenglish
Cruz, explaining how he’s the complete opposite of dry: I add so much SODIUM...
Seems like Dom isn't happy with how casually DC seems to take his work. But approaches differ; Dom must get that. And muting DC when he watches fights for research and analysis 'could' just be his approach or preference in doing his job. Commentators are supposed to be unbiased anyway, so muting your co-worker's comments to analyze a fight as prep work could be good?... 🤔 Who knows?! Dom has a blunt way of speaking and I don't think he didn't think of consequences of his words... I'm sure he does. I'm assuming the media must have extracted that quote out of context. Because Dom admitted saying it. Thanks for uploading DC. 💪🏽
Dominick is such a little angry 🐩
Dom was not hating on anyone. He was asked by an interviewer and so he answered. DC is so butthurt
Dom throwing DC under the bus was a piss poor attempt to build some hype for his fight.
wow this bring fighters pre/post fight interview to the next level. I dont think i have ever watch a more raw interview of fighters before fights than this. disclaimer, if there are others do point it out to me and i shall watch that too,
This is great
when the color commentator and the analytical guy get into it..
What on earth is this?
9:42 Bisping and the rest of the world: tf are you doing?
I love your commentary DC. You and Joe are the best
This doesn’t seem fair with Dom deep in the weight cut.
Have dc and Joe work separate events them together they're laughing half of the time and cracking jokes. Felder anik bisping is the dream team
Dom was wrong though🙌
Cruz did him dirty. It’s like trash talking your colleague with false information
Cool to see DC keep it real and Dom as well. I have to admit i have not been a big DC fan in the past but seeing this kind of interaction has made me a fan. Awesome job guys.
Ok so that's how the conversation goes between two dcs
Lmao 🤣 this was great. Love Dom Cruz
I fucking hate dom, I get you like him DC but I can't stand his commentary.
God damn this jumped right in xD
DC BIG MAD
"There's no right or wrong here"   "I know that's what I've been saying I'm not wrong" hahaha Dominic fucking cracks me up.
Awesome
Khabib- DC this guy....points to something wrong with this guy.....is the guy Dominic Cruz
Sleep this fool
Daniel took it personal ‘cause it’s true lol. It really does show during commentary, especially when he’s trying to talk through jiu jitsu moments. Let Joe Rogan or Dom (the experts) provide the walkthrough commentary at that moment.
after 11 minutes of pointless bickering we go to the judges decision all  3 judges scoring the bout 29-28 for your winner by unanimous decision  DOMINICK "THE DOMINATOR " CRUZ
I think there is a deep seeded resentment of Cruz on DC. With regards to his comment on DC not doing homeworks and throwing DC under the bus he interlaced it with backhanded compliments and calling DC as a friend and he saying these things with no malice, I think Dom thinks himself as being real and DC is not but just a company's man. This is eating him inside and DC seems to be more favourable to the media and UFC.
This is really going to upset the pathetic and corrupt media.
I agree with Cruz
The three amigos. Would be fun to see them do a card without anik or rogan once. See how much film DC watches then haha.
Love it boys! They can’t stop real chemistry even if they tried.
D.C. causing stress for Cruz during fight week 🤦‍♂️ 🤣
Funny stuff...Keeping in real.
DC needs to watch more tape, Cruz can be dry. Just facts
This is cool two homies just hashing it out.. this shit is normal except these dudes know exactly how to throw punches so they talk and not true to punk each other into submission.. feel me?! Lol 😂 guy thing I guess.
Damn, D.C. was cheating to do his commentary job by paying sowing to do his homework for him and he would just repeat it on air.
Dom is dryer than boiled turkey
I much much prefer DC as an analyst.
This was legendary
Lmfao legendary interview
Dom is not wrong to have a opinion but his opinion was wrong and to have that opinion towards colleague saying it in public at least half of them believe its true cause you spend time together at work. and in the end Dom just guessing DC doesn't watch fights, he's not sure.
This is just a P.R. video for D.C. so he doesn't get bad press like he did when Max said D.C. got pulled from calling his fight because he is being bias
Both of these guys have potential to be quality on the mic.  Just need to stay away from the 3 big problems plaguing commentary.   1) Trying to be judges.  The fans can do that themselves, and stick to breaking down the fights.  I adore when they go into technique breakdowns or identify specifically what the fighters are looking for in their movements.  Anyways, unless rounds are stupidly obvious, they should stray away from it.  2) Trying to justify early stoppages.  Fighters get rocked all the time, just because their hurt doesn't mean its over, even with the potential to be.  A fight can still be stopped too early.  3) Talking about striking numbers.  Not all strikes are made equal.  Its like shots on goal in hockey.  It might often point to the winner, but is never a metric to glue yourself to compared to what your eyes are seeing.  Especially when live numbers are inaccurate.
Anyone with a MMA background knows how terrible DC commentary is
This was so awkward.
Doms a lame
DC, you and your team are amazing for putting this out.  I never want Dom to stop being Dom, but the best thing is you guys all get a kick out of it. Shows how you all managed your careers wisely to have this level of good-natured ball busting and presence of mind.
Dom coming after DC's job like that wasn't cool to see
Dominic “The Fisherman” Cruz   He got you good DC
1st video I've watched on this channel, was best interaction I have seen in a long time. Respect to Cruz & Bisping.
Cruz is not good with emotions and dc is. Thats is rhe diverense.
Cruz is the most patronising bloke in existence. He deserved to be called out like this.
Chael Sonnen is the best martial arts analyst
Thanks DC!
This was an amazing, candid look into the chemistry that takes time to build within a business that builds lasting bonds.  Let the good times roll!
Loved the video 🤣
Love DC and Bisoing ,do not like Cruz at all
this is awesome...lol....just made my day
Bisping is a gem
“Accountability is Love” my new catchphrase lol
What an amazing video! Loved it.
Dom is an amazing analysis, absolutely insane. His fight IQ is mad genius. But his on the fly commentary is often so dry it gets easily misinterpreted and taken out of context.  This was hilarious and everything but what I expected coming in to this
This is hilarious 🤣
dominick salty
This the guy who watched a lot of films and said Conor is just resting when he got mauled by Khabib.
Cruz was bang out of line hes a shit commentator aswel
This was gold. DC might win a match up in the ring 99 times out of 100 but Dom tied him up and tapped him out with verbal jujitsu over and over here.
All of this happening only makes me glad I didn't bet on Dom this weekend. This whole thing is an avoidable and unnecessary distraction. Oh, and fuck I miss Dan Hardy...
This was enjoyable. I watched it twice. I agree with Dom that accountability is love. And yes, parents who love their kids obviously do hold them accountable. However, parents usually withhold stern criticism of their kids behavior until they get back home. Doing it in public could cause some unnecessary embarrassment & anger, which might undercut the message and cause some resentment.
DC vs DC.
He is just buthurt that he doesn’t get same respect as DC.  I understand that it looks like Cruz does more research and work to prepare a fight than DC, with the competitive mind Cruz has it looks like laziness, Khabib has called out DC many times for him been late all the time and stuff. It’s a time for both to look in the mirror 🪞
Dom Cruz has a stick up his ass lol wtf I hope this is just weight cutting but God damn
Dom is turning into the ufc queen. First Keith Peterson, now DC? Cmon Cruz wtf. If Dom doesnt apologize to DC, i hope Pedro kos him.
Holy fuck the count walking in killed me 😅😅
Cruz is sneaky
😂😂😂
get rid of your intro dc, check the dip in your analytics
This was amazing
This was amazing.
DC the goat commentating, I like Dominick but sometimes he isn't the best commentating and def has an ego problem
I mute it..... Gold
Dom has a fight to worry about, this could have been done after he wins
This is so funny to see yall go into this shit
How is saying I don't listen to his commentary and mute him is feedback? How is that appreciating him as an analyst?
Cormier sucks
dom shouldn't have thrown dc under the bus, regardless of what his opinion is
Dc commentary is the absolute best.  I like Dom, but i think the punches from Cody Garabrant messed him up.
Very enjoyable. Made my night.
Dom was 100% wrong for the take the money & run comment. He says he’s DC’s friend but gets passive aggressive with him. It just seems like there is  something there beneath the surface.
I’ll be honest, I’d prefer to listen to DC commentary than Dom’s. Dom is insanely dry and I think whether or not he’s super well researched, his takes are just often wrong and whack. There are so many times where he goes “xyz fighter is going to do this” and it never happens. DC is a legend.
This is sad.  Claim to be brothers but dom literally said hes there to just collect his money and leave.  I have a feeling he wasnt joking about it.  Dudes a snake and DC should sack him.
honestly Cruz is my least favorite announcer by far. Extremely dry and monotone. He threw DC under the bus and said that it's all love... what da. I don't even know what to make of him... weird guy
Dom: I don't think I'm dry DC: You don't think you're dry? Dom: No DC: DoMiNiC CruUuUuuuUz!?
This shits real as fuck. Two dudes that disagree with each other and neither backing down for media acceptance but still preserving relationship, I like it
So dc decides during Dominics spotlight to confront him? He could’ve done this privately
Dominic Cruz thinks he’s gods gift! This whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth with him.
DC one of my favorite commentators. Bisping is probably my least favorite because he always sounds like he has a bet on the fight
they should do this monthly
LOL only two min in and this is great..
This was nice to see ❤️ no drama, just frank conversation
Give up commentary DC, Cruz is 100% correct
this video was awesome
I agree with DC that was not cool to throw him under the bus
Dom is 1000% right. DC is a legend tho
This ism hilarious!
Dom is an actual sociopath
This was like a therapy session😂
Dom doesn't see that people will be more entertained by DC than himself during the fight commentating. DC can tell what's is going on enough from his wrestling knowledge, and his eyes are very sharp for fight details. I would have never guessed that DC doesn't watch as much film as Anik or Cruz from the shows, but who cares he does a excellent job...that's why he's got the job. Dom said , basically:  "DC doesn't watch film like me and Jon or Bisping...just wants his money and he out" ...that dude can come off as a back stabber; after losing a fight... "I can smell alcohol on the ref" ...who says that?
Holy shit this was good
DC is lazy in his position in this video...Dom is right!!
DC is right he should of said this to him and not to the media as a friend and a colleague this type of stuff causes bad energy also Bisping is just great aiming in hahaha
Dc in private - I'm just here for the money
I wouldn't say I enjoy DCs commentary, but Cruz is and has always been a snake pos. Pretty disgusting watching DC be a nice guy while Cruz is just pissin directly in his face.
That interview was an absolute cluster fu¢k… And I loved every second of it
Dom comes off as a d bag because he’s hyper competitive and super straight forward. He even says “so I’m wrong?” like he was absolutely flabbergasted that it even was a possibility. You can also see it when Dom is like “what am I bad at?”
Three killers having a nice calm argument
🤙🤙
🤣
Dom is an ass .  You should have told him you just finished watching him get beat up up Cody on repeat lol 😂
Cringe dom, dc commentary 🔥
OMG BISPING COMING IN WAS THE BEST!!! As if the chemistry wasn’t good enough already. Holly trinity !
They talked about everything BUT Dominick’s fight 😂😂😂
This was awesome
Dom hasn't learned the art of friendship. Just because something is true doesn't mean it needs to be said publicly. We all know that person who when they walk in, the rest of people roll their eyes. That's Dom.  Intelligent but awkward, lonely and most likely someone who is always on the outside looking in on every aspect of his personal relationships.   Good on DC for getting ahead of it publicly and dissipating the tension with humor. He masterfully made sure this issue went away so that MMA websites don't dissect it to death for weeks in their quest for clicks.   In real life, DC's personality will always succeed. Dom's will always struggle.
Now I know for a fact DC will take the effort to disprove Cruz by being the most prepared he's ever been for his fight against Munhoz, meticulously describing every single detail about his movements and reads with 100% concentration and zero jokes with Rogan and co. The most dry Daniel Cormier we've ever heard
Lmaooo. This was pretty fun to watch.
Pt . 2
Dominick was salty because people like listening to DC more than him 😂
Dominick the best analyst ?  The same Dominick that said during Conor and Khabib fight : " Conor is trying to gas Khabib out " while Conor was getting smash on the ground ?  😅😅
I thoroughly enjoyed this 😂 😂 😂
Imagine if the lights went off undertaker style, then the baddest man from west Lynn Oregon appeared
This goes to show how much of a prick Cruz is, can't stand him anymore hope he gets flatlined by Munoz. Also he's not a great commentator sorry!!!
bisping is hilarious
Should've just ask Dom if he had a teammate getting ready to fight Khabib and the media asked him who was going to win and in his heart he knew his teammate didn't stand a chance, would Dom lie and say his teammate will win or be honest and say he'll lose. I think he would have his teammates back and lie to not be a distraction and to support them.
Dom's a legend but his biggest weakness is being able to admit he did something wrong. He definitely threw DC under the bus here.
:)))
TOO FUNNY
More of these three arguing with each other please!!
Man Dominic Cruz is very emotionally smart and aware while at the same time having a big log on his shoulder. It's hilarious.
I liked it !
Dom genius : Conor try to ges out Khabib. 😜🤪
Cruz is hella funny and smart man he's just awesome when it comes to talking good ole mma beat downs am I right?
That’s the Chanel that we all been waiting for “ Bruce voice “
This was pure gold
I wish I could more than “like” this,  but I definitely subscribed ❤️😅😂
Conor was gassing khabib out by letting him smashing him Undefeated fighter is not the goat cos he needs to keep fighting till he loose even if he reaches 70 years old.. Cruz the logical fighter
Dom must be on the spectrum for sure. No understanding of any norms 😂
That was fun.... That's what I'm talking about guys!! I love the banter they have.
DC my man, you should've brought the case of biased commentary of Cruz in Khabib vs McGregor.....In Khabib's accent "Tell your friend Dominic Cruz, he is little bit out of mind, he make him tired with his face" 😂😂😂😂
Dom out here keeping his Tucson tude strong.
Cruz is trying to steal everything DC worked for
You're the man DC. Great piece.
Funny how dom starts off so butthurt and defensive lol interesting
I love them knee taps from dc
Damn we're spoiled to have these guys. All of them are great
“Daniel Cormier was never my friend.”
Dom gassed himself giving this interview
DC calls fights better than Dom. I remember when he said look at Conner exhausting khabib out by taking ground and pound.
Lots of passive-agressive love going on between these 2
These 3 need their own reality show together.  Netflix?
I want to litsen to DCs commentary more...no bad thing about being controversial
There was no editing tricks on what Dom said. He said what he said and he's a prick
Gosh, I fking lost it when a he entered the chat!! LMAOOO  (won't say who in case you haven't seen it yet)
DC we like you no worries
Damn dc needs a bigger chair  😂dont do him dirty witht them love handles like tht
DC IS A BITCH.HE IS ALL ABOUT MONEY THAN WORK.MY FAV COMMENTATORS-ANIK,ROGAN BISPING,DOM.EVERYONE IS ELSE SHITTY AND BORING.
Honestly I'm here thinking what does bisping have to say about this drama and   bisping shows up lol and takes this video  levels above where it was already at
Aye, you gotta give Dom props though. He said everything to DC face without holding back and with a straight face the whole time. 😂😂😂
Watch the film DC.
I think Dom is jealous because everyone else has to put hours into their job, while DC can just cake walk his way through the job. No pun intended. But that’s just what you get for doing what DC did in his career.
Cormier views it as rude and Dom thinks it's respectful to be honest about one of his friends. Love them both 💕
That's Messed up D. C. The Way you got treated on your own show Brother 💯 . All good Brother Catch em when they least Expect it 😂😂🤔💯 . You don't need to Watch it over/over when you CALL THE FIGHT 💯💯💯😎
You can't appreciate DC as an analyst if you say you mute him and not even try to listen to what he says.
i know dc wants dom to get knocked out in his fight now lol
Cruz has always come off as very arrogant and a holier than thou.
We all know they settled their differences in the gravey train shower when the camera turned off
Best footwork in the game.
Clicked this video wondering if it was filmed before or after Don’s comment on DC.  Not less than a minute in and here we go!
Rogan is clearly the worst cometary person
Best DC Check-In ever! 😂 Cherry on top would have been if Darren Till showed up too!
Amazing video
DC is 100% in the right to be Mad at Cruz. Cruz basically made it seem like DC was incompetent at his job and only did it for the paycheck
The only person missing is Chael.
The guy who says conor is gassing khabib out by getting punched in the face thinks he is a great analyst xD gosh I can’t stand cruz
Older,middle,& younger brother arguing with each other lol 😂
I love both of them but na dom can’t spin this like he was “telling it how it is” or “they took out the love” when he straight up said he mutes his commentary and he only commentates to get his money and get out, that’s just not cool at the end of the day
So good one of the best interviews out there, fans get to see how the industry works and the fighters and on this occasion the analysts perspective
I wish more of these videos existed. I’m already hype whenever you upload but this was crazy lmao
Dom is a wise man.
Wow this is pure GOLD!
Why do i have a feeling that the memes if cruz loses are going to be terrible snd i think cruz should face that for throwing the double champ under the bus, especially when the addition of DC to the booth has been an incredible feature of a PPV
Those clothes aree way to tight for both DCs !
Gold
Wait Daniel is an Olympic Gold Medalist?
What a refreshing, genuine conversation! Only people who respect each other can do that.
Let's never forget...  DC was the analyst who dropped the cheat code for Greg hardy when he was getting his calf obliterated.  Dom was the analyst who claimed connor mcgregor was gassing khabib out by letting him lay on top of him and pound his face in.  I'll take the Popeyes boy over Connors side piece any time
Bisping is like real life captain Price
“Let’s talk privately, on air” “THATS THE PROBLEM!”
Good on DC for being the bigger man wrapping up a pointless conversation where Cruz pretending to be motivated by Love and refusing to take responsibility ...in truth he is upset at DC and this is passive aggressive payback
Dont mess with 'Prelim Cruz'
Both guys suffer from the common problem of holding other people to your own standards. DC thinks because he wouldn’t criticize his co commentators, they shouldn’t criticize him. Cruz thinks because he takes criticism as love and doesn’t get offended, that other people shouldn’t get offended.
Dom isn’t wrong to have the opinion, but going straight to the press isn’t “accountability” 😂 I’m sure DC could sleep at night knowing he can suffocate Dom by laying on him tho
"I think he's trying to gas him out" don't call Dom the greatest analyst while Dan hardy is still around
This 3 need a show! This was GOLD
This is way better than most interviews Fack
All Dom said was to watch more film. Which DC clearly  don't do and like as much. That can be said public. Nothing personal I think. Good luck Dom love you guys even The Count lol
Dominick Cruz just be throwing EVERYONE under the bus on media day 😂
Love DC. They have a unique chemistry, its funny. Ps. DC is great comentating without a doubt. Love hearing him in fights because hes a breath o fresh air
Two of the worst commentators but I still love em lmao
No matter whether this is right or wrong it’s now creating tons more views and buzz for Dom, DC, and the UFC.. so really it’s a win win. If y’all think DC really cares you’re wrong ash
Dominick Cruz is the Ben Shapiro of the UFC
Bisping made this 100x’s funnier LMAO
this is how politics should be done. refreshing
5:58 Judge Dredd appeared. lol
Nothing wrong with saying what you believe. More people should do that.
Is dom really serious or he is joking 😳 but he seems like a shitty guy
great video, glad to see all this honesty unfold. Michael bisping is becoming a comedy star, he's great
Just eat him DC.
Love you guys. one love. Jah rastafari
In fairness to Dom, he is lazer-locked in on fighting this weekend. He is ready to go.
In the most respectful way possible, does Dom have Asperger's?
"You don't think you're dry??" LMFAOOOOOOO DC is hilarious
Hahahahah😅
Cruz doesn't understand the unspoken man code. I could never hang out with someone that clueless.
*Dom: "exact words" lol*
DC is so butt hurt he got called out on this and mostly because Cruz was right.
Dom stepped over the line. Telling it like it is is one thing, but he went too far elaborating a bit too much. He lacks the gentle persuasion good communicators possess and as such is not likeable
Cruz is just a weird dude that speaks his mind
Dominic is gonna lose yet again. He should’ve retired a long time ago. Also he always thinks he’s the smartest guy in the room which pretty much means he’s unteachable. Does anyone remember when dom said mcgregor was trying to tire khabib out by letting him ground and pound him nearly to death 😂😂😂😂😂😂. What a clown.
Hahaha this is so wholesome
Michael Bisping should've been Kano in the Mortal Kombat movie.
Dominick has had several "wtf" moments in his commentary career and is known to be testy and emotional in certain circumstances. He's in his feelings right now, not being on main card etc., he's even called out commentators directly after his fights saying he's not getting a fair shake. He's gotta relax.
Dominick" The Dick" Cruz
"Just put me in the Middle East, I solve all problems", Micheal Bisping <3.
Oh forgot to add,  DC is way better then Rogan!  DC  10/10  , Joe 8/10
I loved every second of this
Domenick is a LOSER! broke the code of trust!  He needs to retire his game is old school, younger cats will have him for breakfast.  Time to retire bud, you're an avg fighter.  DC is the man!
I seen Dom take a shot at DC then I see this up!? I'm so happy 😂😂 Dom is cutting weight AND on the prelims. That's why he's mad lmao they not friends after this
Cruz’s saltiness is amazing lmao
Dominick is bang out of order for publicly throwing DC under the bus like that. I do genuinely hope he gets knocked out clean.
this is the best video i've ever seen and i'm only 4:45 in lol
Yo! This trio needs to have their own show lol. Lets go!
Dominic is the kid in class who reminds the teacher that the homework is due to hold the entire class accountable, and then wonders why everyone hates him.
🤣🤣🤣
DC should of slapped him
DC he’s right. The truth hurts.
9:43 what? 🤣
This should be a regular podcast
The sarcasm & cruz trying to patronise Cormier is lame
He shouldn’t have said he’s just there for money everything else is a goof
One of the greatest pieces of UFC based content, thanks DC this video is fuckin' amazing brother
this shit was toooo funny XD
Dom Is slowly seeing himself become the villain
DC is terrible, always biased. Cruz and bisbing keep it professional and split. Or maybe DC is lazy because he mentiones a punch by one then leaves the counter and then mentions same guy again so making it seem one sided
I like Dominick Cruz, but what he did to DC was just WRONG. That was not professional, nor was it an act of love. I can understand why DC would be hurt by this, as Dominic basically attacked his character with those disparaging comments. The fact that Dominic Cruz sees nothing wrong with that he did also says a lot about his lack of judgement and empathy.
i was about to turn this off then Bisping showed up and made this video the best one you could have ever produced.
Dom Cruz broke bro code… can’t air out a colleague like that..
DC my job could be in jeopardy? Just like every fighter you critique in the cage due to their performance? Unaware. DC you and Cruz suck. You're upset he called you out.
The only person missing here was Chael Sonnen to stir the pot even more
Bisping just made the whole situation wholesome
Love how Dominic is wearing the same outfit when he trashed DC.
Everybody left more mad than when it started lol. I think DC's got the best commentary of all the former fighters. He's a perfect compliment to Rogan + Anik, or Felder + Anik. My only criticism is his post-fight interview questions. Bisping is better at those. DC just asks the same questions regardless of what happened in the fight.
This was so dope and I’m only halfway through. Real man shit
LMFAO
This is some of the finest shit ive seen and mfs sitting here action like its done real ass shit being said
you really had dom drop that line to drive up engagement on your yt channel
This is the best MMA video on youtube. Well played boys.
Cormier just tries to win the argument by blathering over anything Cruz says 🤣 It's so funny!
Legends.
DC and bisping are right. It’s disrespectful to slander your colleagues on camera like that regardless how he feels about DC. Cruz is a tool.
Dom is the type of guy who goes to a bar just to try and find somebody to fight because if he doesn't his wife might be that somebody.
Talked about like gentlemen
Cruz worrying about DC commentary should be worrying about getting on the main card lol
Considering how much fake news is going around these days, I really appreciated this raw, unedited, uncut emotion from all 3 men here.
Dom did DC dirty in that interview. Tell it how it is, but do it in private to the person not the media.
Cruz has lost his fucking mind. He’s putting a “friend’s” job in jeopardy 🤦🏾‍♂️
“you can’t even do the meetings, you hate them”  yeah that should just be between 2 people not the whole world.
Lol can't believe these got to speak after Dom's comments 😳😂
This is incredible
Dominick loves confrontation
haha ffs Dc watch some tape man
I would have done it behind the close doors ...... But every individual is different
A minute in and these guys are already arguing. Gotta love Cruz lol
Love you both- but I agree with DC. You don't critize your co workers in front of outsiders
Dom is a such a smart guy and not just mma wise. I mean his mma iq is off the charts but just real world smarts he’s so smart he’s breaking down dc here and I love it.
Dom look like the younger brother there
Dom was trying to keep the nerves down, according to the conference. DC didn’t help hahahahah. Best vid ever. DC is right.
This is the best video on YouTube. There, I said it.
Dom has always been an asshole, I'm surprised people have taken this long to notice
Legit one of the funniest things ever
This what I needed tonight 😅🤣😂😂😂
Witty Dom is back that’s prime Dom
Dom is high-key a narcissist
Glad Dom called you out DC, Bisping is coming for your spot
Mr. "Conor is tiring Khabib by letting him bash his face" is saying something about someone else's commentating skill? 😂 Dom is delusional and annoying. If anyone needs to never commentate again, it's him.
LEGENDARY
This is great
Some of y’all rly hate Cruz in these comments man 💀. Literally the only thing u bring up on him is the “gassing him out” line from the Conor vs Khabib fight and he’s already explained his thought process and reasoning as to why he says it
Cruz talking about anything could be recorded and used as an audible torture device.
Nobody has clicked "dislike" on this. Just sayin'.
Love you n bisping vibinn
DC is pissed. Cruz is foul for doing that. But DC is pissed about it. Cruz says it’s not my fault. Yeah, it is. The media won’t print the nice stuff - ever!
DC vs DC
This Is better than the real fights ! 😁
Dom Cruz to be honest is delusional. He should retire. He gets injured every single year. And right now he’s being a jerk because he’s probably going through his weight cut
Dom is dry as fuck I love that DC said it straight to his face 😭
What DC and his team don’t know, is that THIS kind of conversation is EXACTLY the content we want. We want the realness, we’ve all heard about Doms upcoming fight, we don’t want “professional” DC
Dominic Cruz is the dumbest smart guy in the ufc.
This is fake as fuk, If their jobs werent on the line DC would have fucked dom up if he could get away with it. They are definitely not friends. Dom did not give a shit about dc, he was virtue signaling on how honest he is, for his own benefit. He is a little angry man whos not handling his decline well. It is not his job to talk about his coworkers performances. Very unprofessional, truly a snake dick move. He should be fired from analysts position but if he isnt it will be because this got a lot of attention.
dom cruz is dry and he's wrong about DC lol (he complains about everything anyway)
Dominick is so biased
DC pays a guy to do his job for him Cruz is completely right to have the stance he does because he takes pride in being prepared
DC is definitly still mad though
YOOOOOOO "I'LL PICK YOU UP YOU LITTLE BASTARD AND THROW YOU THROUGH THE WINDOW" LMAAAAOOOO
Dom was wrong.
I really think the only thing DC does wrong occasionally is show bias to fighters who are his friends, other than that, I don’t think he needs to watch extensive tape. He is entertaining and also has great knowledge on the fight game. I like Dom, but damn dude, put your ego aside for once and admit you’re wrong.
With DC and Joe, you need to ask Cruz or an Anick
3 LEGENDS
Have to say we need a regular show with DC Dom and Bisping
Dominick Cruz is in the wrong
These guys are just having fun lmao
Ha!!!!!! How funny
Dom is just cranky because he's doing a cut and he's about to fight. He's also so direct and unapologetic that he doesn't see anything wrong with explaining what he thinks is true. He does love DC though, he's not lying, but he should not have answered that question with how the media is with this kind of stuff.  Also, Bisping is the man.
Cruz wants your commentating job.
Michael Bisping is one cheeky bastard lol just jumps in & stirs it up,
Haha love this video. This is how disagreements should be communicated!!
Bisping is a great commentor my favorite by far
DC's commentary is excellent, really engaging, a hybrid of colour commentator and technical analyst. I like Dom too, but this is the guy who thought Conor was tiring Khabib out whilst getting absolutely smashed.
I’d rather listen to dc commentary and get a laugh in than watch dom go to another decision🤷‍♂️
Dominic is brutally self aware, but can’t read the room. You never out your teammate publicly without warning.
This might be the best fight week video of the year. I take that back… it IS the best fight week video of the year.
DC wanted to fill Dom in that was brilliant TV
He called him Cruzy! 🤣🤣😂
Publicity  stunt alarm triggered!
I could’ve watched another hour of this
😂 dc needs to be fired jk this is vary awkward
We love Dc , Dom is such hater
Thank you very much for letting us behind the scenes of the mentality of these 3 legends of the sport. Truly spoiled us. Thank you.
This episode, along with the Colby interview, is the GOAT.  DC being the GOAT of YT.
Cruz is right, DC has not been the best at commentary. I'm not sure if its because of lack of prep, or if Cruz has some personal thing going on, but I really hope DC can up his game. His post-hoc analyses are very good but live its not the same level. That said, Cruz is getting him into trouble LOL
DC is THICC
DC commentary is solid I always thought, Cruz is great to but he is cringe af
Obviously Dom isn’t a down ass foo 🧦
Mr. Cruz so-called self-acclaimed super analyst please go watch and listen to your commentary in the khabib Conor fight. Dc your rocking brother. 👌
This was great. I love how they clearly all have respected for each other and are not afraid of disagree with each other.
This won't be the last time Dominick Cruz throw dc under the bus...just seems like he feels like he deserves something that dc has and is determined to bring anything to the light to let it be known...sure he'll sprinkle some nice stuff In there to be covert about it but.
I don’t care if DC watches every fight by heart, he’s knowledgeable and a ton of fun on the mic and that’s the most important thing. Dom’s acting like in order to commentate you have to be some sort of a fight nerd, that may work for him but people are different. Does he really think Rogan, for example, studies every single fight?  Used to like Dom but he’s been unbearable for a while and this just takes the cake.
DC is most biased commentators
This was great.
I bet Dom is awesome at a party
Dom is one of those people that if you get a compliment from him you know your doing good, because he has absolutely no problem hurting your feelings and shitting on you to your face!!!
Dc is pissed at cruz because of what  he said in presser and its true he is a terrible commentor dc
Dom is like lice to the scalp. 😆 🤣 😂 I love this dudes, straight face shot talk. Between him and Chael, best shit talkers, hands down.
Hahahhah i loved when bisping joined in
This was great. Like walking in on a family argument lol
It’s a shoot work, DC knows what he’s doing 🤣
Dom saying Conor was resting when Khabib was ground and pounding him is still the funniest bad commentating in MMA, and he is trying to start stuff lol.
More of this DC 😂 this ain’t ESPN you don’t gotta be all buttoned up & professional . Stay real 🤞
Listening to DC say "Thug Rose!!!" 100 times over is so frustrating. I'd take Dom's commentary any day
yo what kinda shoes is bisping wearing?
Best episode! We need more of DC off the rails with Michael Bisping
Dom is just pissed he isn’t the A team.
I love these 3! How bout Dom telling a different story though. According to Bisping, Dom got in his face and said “you want to punch me don’t you?” 😂
Face to face everything changes
Good luck Dom!
It’s about to be 6 years since losing to Garbrandt.  As infrequently as he fights, it’s crazy that he can perform at high level still.  But how does this guy keep friends….?
Literally funniest interview ever hahahaha then bisping comes in and brings his personality in and jjst makes it awesome 😂😂😂
I remember: "he is trying to gas khabib out"
Cruz (the worst commentator in the UFC) really has the gall to critique DC (One of the commentator GOATs). I think the funniest part was when Cruz said he thought he was entertaining xD
Lol this is fuckin incredible! Dominic has no chill 😂 I was dieng when bisping also said “just do your research” to DC 😂
"He's trying to gas Khabib out..." haha But Dominique is anyday sharper than DC. To the point, no oh ha ooh, Talks clear.
🤣🤣🤣 Why does Daniel comier always get bullied
Dom trying to put you on common ground to justify his comments 💀 😂 🤣
One day DC is going to lose his shit and high crotch Dom into another dimension.
He's trying to put you out of a job 😆 🤣 😂
Thanks for making and uploading this  Its kinda a low blow from cruz to be like this. You do this stuff behind the camera and give feedback like this, not trash someones job and his way to make a living   To be fair, cruz also doesnt do the best job himself saying conor tires out khabib by getting 10-7'ened in a round  So he shouldnt be out here acting like the most insightful guy telling people to do homework thats kinda hypocritical, and i like cruz   But cruz asks dc impossible stuff, "tell me why and how i set up this and this in my fights"  Thats stupid  So cruz is saying ge uses the same gameplan and moves every fight?  Maybe thats why he became predictable and the game caught up with him🤷‍♂️
love how bisping just grabbed a chair and joined in the banter. The whole video was hilarios. Loved it Great content DC
This was chaos but I enjoyed every second of it
Cruz was out of line, Cormier checked him in a respectful manner, the way a friend handles it.
This was healthy and dope  Good shit boys
Please don't take this on the road...
This candid 12 minute vid with these 3 is worth more than every triller PPV assembled.
Dc litteraly calls out things Dom and other analayst would need to rewatch multiple times live.. DC is the most honest commentator, Cruz said Conor gassed out Khabib😂
I respect all three of these guys analytical work. Different flavors and different opinions on things from 3 different champions? Golden.
DC stop crying man you know he’s right
Sometimes I expect at any second for DC to backhand that little weasel Dom right out of his chair. No wonder Uriah didn't like him, the guys a dick
Dom speaks the truth and DC can't handle the truth. 😆
Dom really reminds me to my godfather, he's always been a difficult kinda guy
Has Dom ever lost an argument? He needs to have a masterclass on how to always be right
We need a part 2.
In my opinion dom is the worst commentator. He really does suck
lmfaoo bisping was needed in this
We need a 5 hour podcast for these three guys right here. This video was very fun
DC is 100% in right. “Hold accountability” ok but do you out your friend in front of the public eye to hold them accountability? Or do you them one on one?
y'all are so funny
This was fantastic!
this started weird as fuck lol
I dont see this video staying up for very long LOL
Dom has nothing else to do BUT watch fights and is mad because DC is highly sought after for not being boring as shit. I love Dom really as well but he really is a fucking asshole lol.
Dom is shit friend
Dom is wrong n he knows it that was embarrassing!
This is amazing
Dom sounded like a child in this. Even Bisping defended DC and says he watches film and all Dom could say was DC doesn’t watch film. Why couldn’t he just admit he was wrong? And DC hit the nail on the head Dom is super dry and boring I can’t stand listening to his commentary.
DC is shaped like a bag of flour
The real fight companion
DC’s chair fighting for its life lmao
I swear Dominick Cruz is like a woman and that all he does is use his mouth he doesn’t even know how to maturely have a intellectual exchange in a conversation with another person. He simply tries to over or out talk them trying to win this imaginary debate that he has with everybody in his own head whenever he’s conversing with another person. It’s ridiculous. It’s like he’s a child. All he does every time is talk over the person so that they don’t have an opportunity to say the things that he knows would contradict and dominantly counter the opinions and statements that he makes. I just wish this little bigger fucker could man up
3 legends in fighting talking about their commentating jobs... priceless
DC and Dom are two different types of commentators. The reason I love listening to DC is he brings things to the same level as me and my boys just watching and enjoying the fights. It’s fun and it should be. With Dom everything is buttoned up, he’s professional and yes that’s needed in commentary. The ying and yang of their two styles is what makes the fights entertaining.   If I had to choose between the two I’d rather listen to DC call a fight than Dom, but I don’t watch the UFC to be educated about fighting I watch it to enjoy myself and DC makes the fights fun.
DC is shaped like flubber lmaoo
Yeah, this rules
bisping guest appearance made this the greatest interview ever haha
Cruz can have an opinion but just give some examples instead of saying I mute you
This is gonna be good after hearing Dom at the media scrum lmao
This is a legendary group
DC is shaped like one of them boogers from the mucinex commercial lmao
BISPING HAHAHAAHAHAH
For whatever shortcomings DC might have as a commentator, Dom has issues to the same level almost in the polar opposite direction. He is overly analytic and combative with his broadcast partners a lot of the time. I find it hard to listen too. He severely lacks a sense of humor in a lot of moments when working the booth as well.
“Who made that rule” 😂😂😂💀
You just CAN’T go at your colleague like that. That’s. a b**ch move right there
This is the best piece of mma content I've ever seen in a decade. GOLD.
Need to call you Triple Champ DC bc you are the only person to go head to head with Dom, when he is already pissed at you, and come out EVEN. Not winning the debate but held your own against the undefeated and most calculated sh*t talker in the UFC ... You can see it in his past fight-week face to face discussions... he DESTROYS whoever it is bc it's like he flips a switch and just has stuff locked and rdy to go.. Mad props at getting this finished and uploaded so damn fast.. He's still in the same clothes from where he made the diss... wow.  NOTE: I think DC won this argument bc he's right about him just saying it to the press bc it's really just dissing him and not talking to him in person and airing it out. But Dom is built different, he's cold but also his dedication and robot like determination is a result of his lifestyle of being right most of the time bc he's intelligent as hell. He should have just owned up to it. lmao.
DC is shaped like a southern grandma
Dom , is a real one , DC can afford to pay someone to research a fighter verbatim , it's the same as having a stunt double.... DC you towel holding champ you , we see the real you now bro. lol , just joking DC ....
cruz is so full of himself
Dude dom is just a smarter tj ...........little snake in the grass.
Dude dc needs the cage one more time or something. He picks fights with Lauren, rc, bisbing, khabib and now Dominic within the first minute of his video.
Snoop is better commentary than DC.
Don’t really hate DC,Cruz or bisping on commentary dan hardy did a great job too paul fielder does good too I think if anyone they should confront is Rogan coz recently he has a lot of bias whenever he commentates
this is fucking awesome lmao
dom is so lameeee
Best UFC related video I have seen in a while
Cruz was wrong for saying what he said to media. I love when dc commentates and whether or not he is good at it is neither here nor there. Cruz shouldn't have done that to someone who is suppose to be his friend.
DC is terrible and bias. He got flamed by Cruz. He's so tight because it's true.. he didn't even know Sean Brady's name... He coached Chase Hooper to a sub. He'll talk technique with only 1 English speaker in the Apex. Aka helping 1 side only. I just wish he wasn't so against listening to this constructive criticism.
This was incredible
Dominick Cruz roasted you.... He said you DON'T DO YOUR HOMEWORK?  You just come in unprepared and pickup a paycheck for DOING NOTHING..
DC > Cruz
This is some real shit! Honestly, this is my fav video
Someone is a HATER 👀.  DC is one of the best commentators in the biz
I can’t believe there’s an interview right after addressing Doms call outs of DC. Lucky us!
Feels good being a fly on the wall
Felder > DC
Hahaah thats cool!
This was fun 😆
Don't mean this is an insult at all but I wouldn't be surprised if Cruz is on the spectrum.  Exhibits several of the characteristics.
DC is in damage control... because the 'call out' was true. Lets be real... DC post fight interviews are by far the worst, they are rushed, unprepared and awkward. His commentary is massively bias and one sided. DC just talks over people til they don't care to respond... meh - viva la cruz honesty.
There's a big global audience thats hooked on content of DC just goofin off. Goofin off in the gym w the Russians. Goofin off w the colleagues. I'm one of them. This is gold. I'm just putting this here so that anyone that's managing this channel knws.. Moments like these are v much appreciated. Much love
2 of these guys are entertaining commentators, the other is Dominic 'sahara' Cruz.
Yes , Dominick is in the wrong 100% it’s slandering of a co-worker sounds like a little weasel I work with who talks about coworkers behind their back lol.
DC is right there is some professionalism, that cruz lacks
best video they all kept it real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love DC the fighter but he is annoying as hell as a commentator
Dominick still a snake in my book
I loved every bit of this. Especially Mike randomly popping in! 🤣
DC is one the best commentators/Analysts that the UFC has. Cruz was being hundred percent biased in his opinion about DC and he shouldn't have said what he said publicly.
Dom your wrong and you know it. man up!!
That's right DC! Shady shit from a colleague.. unwritten rule!
Cruz's IQ is either super high or he is super crazy
Hardcore fans love this vid
Also Dominick: “he’s trying to tire Khabib  out” Conor: (getting ground and pounded to the face)
Lol these guys are fucking brothers
This confrontation look like Shaquile O'Neil and Kobe Bryant.
DC always getting shit in come on now he a good dude
This was AMAZING 😂
lmao great interview 1st minute theyre just arguing 🤣🤣
I like Dominic fighter. I dont much like his personality because he oftens reminds me  - me. Thinks he is really smart, maybe he is, but when he talks smart, comes out as dumb. See? Just like this comment 😁
Who would’ve thought that Michael Bisping be the voice of reason. NOT ME.
This is raw shit! Wow. Thanks for uploading DC
LMAO i knew this was gonna happen when i saw DC check in with Cruz haha
It was very weird when Dom called out his coworker. Bisping coming in was gold!
Love this content I was waiting to see what DC would day but didn’t expect this !  Edit:  the count pop in makes this even better holy shit this is solid 😂
Bisping inserting himself into this talk  just makes this even more perfect 😂😂😂
This is great stuff, DC is the man!!
Dominick Cruz is 100% right.
Dominick Cruz doesn’t sound like a friend here tho…
Thank you for having a conversation about it, showing people it’s ok to go back and forth. My opinion - Cruz isn’t wrong for his opinion, just wrong for going public with it.
Thanks for sharing this DC. You’re a real one
Dom was wrong for throwing DC's commentary skills under the bus like that. Everyone can have an opinion, but Dom is a co-worker and co-analyst to DC and his word carries some weight to it (not a lot, but some) and to to undermine a co-worker like that to the media is just flat out slimy and dirty.   Y'all know it too.
Three world champions just chilling
One of the most wholesome and fun videos I've seen :)
DC was right in my opinion. Cruz crossed the line a little bit. DC did the right thing by callin him out on it, and by doing it on his personal channel.
Man, Cruz is the most defensive person lol actually so hard to watch him talk
Dom threw the homie under the bus
i love DC´s commentary and you´re right DC if Dom respects you as an analyst why would he say he turns it off..professional courtesy yep you guys love each other dough thats clear
Next sit down Chael and Jones.
DC getting so lazy 😂😂 and sensitive
Dc & Jon Jones sit down next !!!!
DC is way more entertaining than Dominic Cruz tbh...  "I think he's gassing Khabib with all the punches he's taking...I really think that's the game plan here." 😂
We need a sit down between Ariel and Dana next.
DC you must hate Cruz to post this but you are a legend , all love
I dont think dom has that much of a filter. He was so happy for dc when he won vs stipe and saying like OH NOO when dc was losing to stipe you can see dom really likes dc i dont think he realized how bad what he said was at the time when he was asked that question
I like all three on what they bring… but real is real Dom is the best. But when I heard him commenting on the Khabib v Mcgregor if you re-watch it he was bad and actually Joe Rogan was right which is rare lol. For the exception of when Joe said Mcgregor was talking trash during the fight and Dom corrected him and said no Joe… Khabib is the one doing the trash talking.
DC is my favorite commentator hands down, i like personality. I’m also a huge grappling fan, so I’m bias.
6:15 Bisping is hilarious 😂😂
cruz look like he in the principles office
2 real one's.
I do think Cruz is in the wrong here, criticism is fine you do can have your opinion but saying that he "muted" him when DC does his commentary is not fair because you know the media gonna take it as a fact that he doesn't watch fights,  Cruz could be more subtle in delivering his criticism just saying DC could've watch more fights is enough no need to take it more personal as far as saying that he "muted" him because he doesn't watch fights
DC is right here. What Cruz said at the press conference could potentially put DC's career as a commentator in jeopardy (even though we all know it won't). That's like your friend/colleague at work talking about how much you slack off right in front of your boss. Also, I think that Cruz is even more irritable than normal due to the weight cut lol
i like DC, but i dlike him less goofy and more ..student of the game.. cause he has lot to offer on this great champ
Should ask him how he develop the legendary technique, the face block. Connor almost broke khabib arm with that technique.
Love DC. Protect him at all costs. For those who haven't watched, the weigh in show is fantastic because of many reasons, most importantly DC
this is amazing lol
Dominick "let's talk" Cruz
Always like these two together even tho dom was throwin some shade early on 😂
"I didn't say you were a bad commentator, I just said you only do it for the money, you're not prepared, and I mute you when you're on."
DC > Dom. Taking Munhoz ML now.
That researcher is The Weasel
Best video so far uploaded to this channel, great stuff 💪🏽💪🏽
To much honesty and i love it.
These 3 together pure gold if UFC 269 wasn't this weekend and it was a regular fight night this may be my favorite piece of UFC related content all week
You are the man D.C., you deserve many more subscribers
Cruz acting like he didn’t completely come at DC for no reason 😂 Why he trying to justify it ?
Dom is seriously immune to his own asshole nature. For how smart he is he fails to psycho analyze himself and see his own negative traits. Unapologetically himself. It's quite a thing to see honestly. Humans are interesting characters
I love this so much. They’re funny as hell and they’re so genuine, I respect this.
D R A M A   S H O W
This video as a whole was epic. 9:02 is the peak. Cruz deffo not as dry as DC thinks tbh.
The timing of this video is hilarious
its like does never seen any other sport. you don't call out your teammate in the media, and it is on you to know how ur words can be twisted
😂😂😂
Boy, this started off great lol
We need more content like this especially when media cherry picks quotes- thank guys
Damn, perfect fucking timing! Just sat down with popcorn lmao
This is truly awesome!!!
cruz was wrong for that lol
Where’s the flood cruz ?
It's like Dominick doesnt understand just cause you have an opinion, there is time and place, it's like a child who doesnt get it or stick hard on 'i have my opinion'.
Cruz was being a dick, and it was wrong for him to blindside Cormier like that. If I was him we wouldn't have been cool after that. Just straight business all the way.
Dom Cruz is a sociopath and nobody can convince me differently.
I didn't think this vid could get even more legendary before bisping showed up!
Dom ain't wrong, but the way he presented his feelings was not right. Personal opinion.
DC has a lot going on professionally it seems and might not do the same research but it doesn’t mean he is any better/worse than other analysts as they said. Completely bad form of Dom to call out DC like that… maybe he’s trying to bring ratings or attention to his fight but he seems To be annoyingly stubborn or completely naive to unspoken social/professional rules.  Would be hard to get over that grudge if I were dc
Wasn’t expecting that… loved it tho!
DC is great with the wrestling breakdowns during the fight and I learn some things from it too. Dom is a hater, he didn't have to call him out in public like that. I would never do that to a colleague that I was so called friends with.
Dom just sounds so bratty talking like he’s making these comments all based off of DC’s way of calling his last fight…which is a fight he’s salty about in the first place…
I really wanna be part of their friend circle...lmao
مرق عدس
DC bro you didn’t even know Sean Brady’s name 😂
Cruz is right
Wow look at Michael Bisping being all diplomatic and mediating a workplace dispute…GROWTH! Lol what an awesome segment!
5:33 "You don't think you're dry!?"  "No, I add so much sodium and seasoning to that" Possilby the driest reply ever this is great lol
For the love of god fix that intro and patch the annoying typing noise
Dominick “stab your coworker in the back” Cruz
you watched the fight but did you analyze it?
Did they watch the fights?
ABSOLUTE GOLD
This is amazing content. Allowing the world inside an unshakable friendship
Dom was ready to talk his shit
DC IS 100% right!
These three need to be on a TV reality show 😅
So dom is cranky from the weight cut, Dc is offended from doms actions,and Bisping is just there to fuck with them both
He’s gassing Khabib out with this argument
Dom with the flavor shakers
Yeah we rockin with Prelim Pedro this weekend!!
The smelling of alcohol and cigarettes comment Cruz made, made me hate him, but fuck that, putting not only your work colleague down but a friend down when he didn't have to, Dominic man come on 🤦‍♂️😵
We got the three stooges over here DC, Cruz and Bisping 😂😂
Cruz is a weird man. Be careful around that guy DC. He was absolutely in the wrong but doesn't take accountability and flips it on you like a woman. Feminine little man.
Have to agree with DC and Bisping on this one. If Dom really felt the way he did about the commentating, as a professional courtesy to DC, he should've addressed it privately with him.   Dom is really good at gas lighting lmao
Dc has a lot of patience lmao
This was so much fun. Cruz should have said that off camera.
This one of the funniest things Ive seen in a min😂
I can’t stand dom man what a terrible person
Dominick wouldn't even make my 3 on the desk
I love how Bisping casually grabs a chair and plops right in the middle. The man wants to stir the pot even more 😂
On this week's episode of cheaters....The confrontation👀
Dom Cruz has a horrible take, what else is new.  😂 Brush it off champ.
Dc you're lucky you didn't get ankle picked, great video
Love Cruz for always being direct and transparent.
This was hilarious
Lmaoooo loved this sitdown DC keep growing my man 🤙
This is the best content, Cruz not backing up. Bisping roasted both 😁😁
10-8, Cruz.
I can't believe this took place but it was so funny. Cruz lowkey doesn't like DC. I wouldn't expect a friend to make a comment like that. DC calling Cruz dry is kind of equally as mean tho.
This was one of the funniest videos I’ve seen in a while😂
Man dom is annoying
Dominick is such a manipulative person bro, I see straight through him. What he said about Daniel Cormier was crossing the line especially if they are supposedly friends. He’s always in these arguments with people because he has to be right no matter what and will use his intelligence to manipulate the situation in his favor. He’s smart but easy to see through. Don’t like his personality. Not that anyone asked or cares
Dom is delusional
Bisping tho 🤣
Wow Dom is mad lol. He is being passive agressive
When the interviewer become the interviewee.... Dom should be the last person to complain about commentary.
A heavyweight, middleweight, & bantamweight walk into a bar
“He’s trying to gas khabib out” 😂😂😭😭
Not surprised by Dom DC - he's a very sensitive dude - and actually has some female tendencies.  But this was funny watching 3 average MMA analysts go at each other  - wishing they could hold a candle to Joe Rogan 🤣🤣
😂😂😂
DC literally breaks down film for his "detail" show...Cruz is just caught off guard while weight cutting.  Hopefully this doesn't affect his focus this week
Damn that was quick
Wow dom showing his true colors
This was so funny, the chemistry you guys have together is very authentic and you guys are hilarious. I was hoping of a more analytical episode of DC check in but this was just as good if not better. I've been a huge fan since you fought rumble and became LHW champ. Awesome stuff DC, keep making good content like this and much love to you Champ Champ.
Damn I’m honestly coming to fall out of liking dom now- the heck is he even saying *accountability* he’s like quizzing DC as if he’s the HR of ESPN. Smh
this is easily one of my favorite videos on the platform
The real feedback is that a good percentage of the time it feels like Cruz hates everyone around him in the booth. You don't need to have all the acid he throws around.
Love all three of you an commentators!
DC has the best commentary!!!!
I'm a fan of both of these guys. I completely understand where DC is coming from but I am a big Cruz fan because of the way he tells it like he sees it.
DOM was mad he is on prelim and he burned DC for no reason very low key but that’s who he is anyway
Dom changed his narrative. What an asshole
Cruz is so lucky he is an amazing fighter bc this dude is always begging to get punched in the face with some of the stuff he says. Such an instigator.
DC being almost at 100k subs is so awesome hahah
This is the single greatest piece of UFC media ever created and recorded.
This was An amazing interview
Dominick does not understand social norms and is just honestly a snake in the grass. Never liked him and this is one of the reasons why. Feel bad for DC here
DC's wrestling commentary is no doubt good. But he makes annoying comments like "oh this fight is sooo boring" during the gane fight vs Volkov, which had beautiful distance management and shot selection.
Dom said that he mutes DC. Lmaoooo. That’s not love. That’s hate. Respect to all 3, big fans. Great vid.
So basically Cruz wants DC fired   Can’t say I would be mad about that. Hopefully they will bring back Hardy
Dom claimed he never said DC was "bad" but he literally said he mutes the TV when DC is commentating lol
Cruz has a fight this weekend he should not be getting distracted in this
If I had to pick a commentator I would pick Joe Rogan and John Anik  😂 love you champ 🏆🏆 came with my popcorn and I'm glad you guy's made up and man what a show with 3 HOF legend's of the sport
DOMINIC CRUZ IS THE SAME GUY THAT SAID CONOR WAS LETTING KHABIB PUNCH HIMSELF OUT lool
Dominic Cruz is the most insecure person on earth 🤦‍♂️
Dom has a permanent chip on his shoulder. He must realise what he did was wrong. Can't do that to a friend.
Dom is a bad team mate idgaf cringe asl for this
So funny! No word to describe!
Lol, this was great! Real a$$ dudes
10-8 Cruz
Imagine uncle Chael there too...
You're right DC. Professionally he called you out almost like he was shaming you. Its embarrassing. And it shouldn't happen
you can tell dom was ultra defensive every second of this video. idk why he agreed to do this. not the best look lol
Some gold content here
THANK YOU FOR BEING REAL. WE LOVE TO SEE YOU GUYS GO AT IT!!!
Quickly becoming one of the best MMA YouTube channels out there. Well done, my man!!
Dominick is so salty Daniel is 100x the commentator and fighter he is, him and rogan themselves bring in viewers to the UFC regardless of the fights
This was fucking hilarious
😂 😂 😂 this is gold
Dom never shuts up during the broadcast it’s annoying.
It's just the same as teammates would in sport. You call them out in the dressing room, not in the media. Whether Dom's comments were on point or not, he should have said them behind closed doors if they are friends.
🍿
This is awesome live content D.C wow
bro this is the best video on all of youtube. watching these dudes shoot the shit like this is amazing
Dom dry as hell
You caught him during a weight cut. Not the best look.
I thought Dominic is preparing for the fight….
Don’t we all have a guy we work with like Dominick cruz? I do a know it all straight by the book weirdo that will rat u out in a heartbeat.
Dc just totally put him in his place, I’m sorry but Cruz is kinda acting like a baby. Dc always seems so much more knowledgeable and comfortable than Cruz on the mic. Just my opinion.
Can we “Mute” DC and just listen to Bisping and Dom 😂
Dc has to work on getting better mics
Never verbally spar with Cruz. DC observe
LeGGoooo DC! I see that 100k sub is coming quick!
😂😂😂
This is going to be interesting 👀👀
Tbh Dom is the worse one to listen commentate
Dc has the best commentary better than rogan
DC already pulled up on him 😂
Let's go champ champ 🏆
Dominick Cruz once spent a night on commentating , beefing with Bisping
DC knows 💯💯💯💯
DC eating that burger hella funny :joy:
I love DC on commentary! He has outstanding wrestling knowledge and picks up a lot of the things I miss in real time. I guess a little more research couldn’t hurt though 😂
Don't forget to "Like" & "Subscribe"!! Hit that bell notification as well!! Almost to 100k Subs!!!
Dominick Cruz has no room to talk he said Conor was making Khabib tired by using his head to block Khabib’s punches
Here.
Awkward 😅
