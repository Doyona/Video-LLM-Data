Had 18 days to prepare for the champions league final and still underestimated Chelsea's counterattacking despite their previous displays against us in the fa cup and premier league unbelievable.
Why could PSG not win
Guardiola os the best coach period. He rebuilds teams if he has to and wins.
I wish I had the football brain of pep
Teacher of teachers
Contracts with The championship,From a fan off City and Kevin 😊👍
What a genius. Congratulations to the Club.
Pep best coach
Amazing Manager- hope u stay 4 more seasons My manager
Greetings from Germany🇩🇪🇸🇴 we're going to winn  the champion viva City

Congratulations Mancity.your consistency paid off..🙏🙏🙏
Congratulations over ur victory boss Guardiola but let's focus on the champions league, from BORNO state Nigeria city fans💯
Well done, Pep. We need the Champions League now.
Pep and City only need 1 step more, good luck
Love you Pep
Never get fired what a smart coach
Congratulation boss
Pep is on another league of his own. He gets results and still manages to stay very humble about it. Great Respect
Congratulations 👏
Congratulations to city hope you win the champions league from Leeds United 👍
not a big fan of city or Guardiola for that matter but, they deserve the league and they have a tremendous season with all the ups and downs especially the way they started the season it seemed like they were playing very bad at the beginning of the season but than they prevailed and continued to win and evolve and get better game by game so I think they really deserve the trophy and congratulations to them.
Love you baldy 💙💙😭😭
Congratulations city
Champions league now
Don't like the idea of he is the best guy in the league but he's not. Only thing he's the best is most racist coach in the soccer league
Congratulations City
MAN.. RESPECT.. WHICHEVER CLUB HE GOES.. THE CLUB BECOMES CHAMPIONS AND PLAYERS BECOME LEGENDS ❤️👍🙏
💙💙💙💙💙💙
Important UCL sky plus from Somalia Pep great coach
You deserve it Pep and Ur great tell so because u r really incredible and for hardwork during the whole season, enjoy bit guys
Pep has lifted the level of the premier league. Incredible manager.
Congrats from United fan , hope you do a job on the rentboys
he has produced the best passing in football history
Heard people who called him fraudiola is now hiding in same bunker where Bin laden hide.
I'm a city fan but I admit that Tuchel exposed twice Pep's philosophy wrong and for sure If pep keeps understimating his opponents I have a strong feeling that Stamford Bridge will have the second championships league cup.
Friends please pray for people on India they are having a very painful death due to lack of oxygen. Please pray for their families 😭 and please pray to god that everything can be ok.
We are Citizens 💙💙💙
He lost his mother but later made the comeback and he now gave us a chance to win the treble
good pep
Aguero will be the Manager of @mancity in future.
Pep gaurdiola is one of the legend coach.
We should start addressing him as Sir Pep Guardiola, 31 titles in 12 years is just phenomenal. Also I really hope he leaves PL soon or else it'll become a farmer's league 🙄
Congrats 🇧🇩🇧🇩
Congratulations guys from a Barça fan. I'm really happy for you and for the players and of course for Pep ❤💙
50% success since promotion from championship is great. Hope they end the decade with champions league cup.
You are the best teachers in football
True definite coach actually...he came from far these season
Hope chelsea win the ucl final
Long time Liverpool fan here. I have nothing but respect for Pep. He's truly one of the greatest managers in the game and that's evident in the way he turned the team around and the tactical adjustments he made after a disappointing start of the season. Congrats to all City fans on a well-deserved title. Although I'm gutted after our team endured a terrible year, I'm looking forward to next season when our squad is back in full strength and we can have a proper thrilling head-to-head race for the title like before. Good luck in the UCL final.
Sir Pep
EPL is the toughest League.. There are 6 rich teams excluding  Leicester and Everton :)
https://youtu.be/Yzp1HUm8i5Q
Loveee
Next trophy ucl
Absolutely genius 🧠
man city 2021 is like the bayern munich of 2020 but 1 million times better
I remembered people saying, he wouldn't win or dominate in England.  But hey 3 premier league titles in 4 years, what a great manager.
Come on city 💙💙💙
Thank you :)
We are desperate to win champions league 💙💙💙
Congratulations all the way from Mumbai City for fan 💙💙💙💙
Good 4 him! What a turn around season

Thank you for what you’ve done for our league Pep! Newcastle fan ❤️
You know what made a premier league so special? Cause the big team not always win, and the small team not always lose, and can you imagine so many big coach have fail in premier league like carlo,jose, emery, is really a tough league in the world
Materi pemain kau jauh lebih bagus dripada yang lain, jadi jangan senang.

BEST COACH
The best coach of all time Pep you LEGEND!!!!
How can anyone other then the plastic man city supporters respect pep Guardiola? He has had everything at every big club he has been at. A Barcelona team that didn't need managing? A bayern team full of superstars? A man city team that have unlimited money and will throw £50/£60 million at any player no problem? Guardiola has been gifted at every club he has managed.
Terimakasih Pep👏
Come on my Cityzens. Love u Pep what a hero 💙💙💙💙💙
Sawa ,hapo poa mzee pep.
“I am happy, more than you believe”
No one: Literally Nobody: Pep legs: 0:18 👀
Thanks Pep for bringing back the title to where it truly belongs. Champioons again. 💯👌😀
GOAT no doubt what so ever
I remember how pro lost his mother she’d be proud of what her son has achieved sensational manager managing a sensational team with sensational players Congratulations Manchester City you deserve it no questions asked you have been so good. I have never been so praising about a rival club like yours. But still you deserved it and may you get more successful moments in the future. Liverpool fan
Well done man city and pep even though I'm a man United fan

Beat of luck man city for UCL final win that title come on.
We will the ice as well…cmon city get the trebles  Edit-I meant we will win the ucl
Congratulations to man city for winning the EPL.
In fact, winning the Premier League is more difficult and appreciated more than winning the Champions League! Because for the second year in a row, English teams have been in the Champions League and UEL finals, which means that Premier League clubs are stronger in Europe and become the first among them!
Brilliant manager. Characteristic of a leader is to adapt to difficult situations and find solutions. He changed style of play without a no 9 and still won the league. True visionary.
Can we also bag the 29 May 2021 game, in Pep we trust
You know funny how everyone is ranting about us being plastic fans and yet we are the ones with 3 trophies assured.. The PL ,Carabao and Premier League 2 and to rub it in the UCL is just around the corner... Soo sad they say we are only 4 in the world but I'd rather be happy with the 4 fans we have than the millions who sit at home trophyless only to come rub their losses because we beat y'all once again and we will keep doing it because we are city !!... Comment  & trash talk all you want but as long as we getting trophies your insults are just a cool breeze...
Indian🇮🇳 cityzen⛵🔥🔥🔥
Congrats CITY 💯🔥🔥🥳🥳
Not there yet. The champions League is ours💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
What a turn around from pep and the team and the management and the fans ..Great win one more in the cabinet  Letss go Cityzens 💙 focus on the ucl 💯

Championee Championee ole""ole"oleeee🎵🎶🎶🎊🎊🏆🎖️🏆🎖️🏆🎖️
Pep ,go and save your team, for whom you played, who gave you direction, go and save fc Barcelona, every thing is crumbling down there, one player(messi) cannot change everything but one manager can do many things (like he wants team to play and all). Barcelona is in dire need of a good coach.
City city city
Best manager in the world with the best team in the world. What a combination....Love you City💙💙
Champions league next?
champions
LET'S WIN THE UCL. GO CITY💙
Lest it be overlooked, Pep lost his mother early this season, yet managed to operate with even more insane focus than ever before. Never takes credit and dispenses it liberally. We're truly lucky to have him. CITY!
Congrats Mancity. Now we need UEFA

Oke,, when he coach barcelona and succeed, i think because the team is already in the best shape...  When he coach bayern, i think he won trophy because its too easy for bayern winning in that league..   But after this 4 years in the england,, okay... I agree know,, He is the best manager....   In premier league, even with a lot of money, you can't easily won in this competition... But this guy, wow, he is amazing...

Not a city fan, but i'm actually rooting for them in the final. Pep is such a mastermind, he deserves to lift another CL.. for the work he's done with man city, for his effort and input on entire league and philosophy of beautiful attacking football.  He built his team as a puzzle, took a while for him to find several pieces, but i love how he finally did it. Pep & KDB deserve the UCL title

When the team was misfiring, Pep could've denied it. Instead he acknowledged the problem, analyzed it, adapted his methods and corrected it. Then guided his squad to victory. Why this is a manager's title.

Best manager 🚀🚀
Jesus loves all of you
Self absorbed, he thinks he is the best, but has the best talent at his finger tips, joke of a manager.
Congratulations
What a fantastic result for Pep and I agree the league is the most important as the best team wins over the season. It’s about Chelsea again now. Both teams evenly matched so should be a good game. Great City team but also a few stand outs. Not very often defenders get the plaudits but Dias has been a revelation. Award for most consistent player - KDB and Gundongan showed KDB is not the only attacking midfielder.
Congratulation guys for winning the premier league.. Well done
Congratulations 🥳 🏆🎊
Pep is a class act💙💯 it's buckle down for the cl now..come on cityyyy
Come back to barca
