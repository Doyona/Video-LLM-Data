rock shox reverb dropper...worst dropper ever produced!
I've wondered, do people have to pay when you do the flip bike? Or at least some people when you're giving the bike an overhaul?
0:04 I have the exact grips
I'd never let this guy work on my bike lol
Seth, I love your flip bike series. I’ve learned so much, been inspired, bought tools and flipped bikes now. You are a big part of that for me. I’ve even been able to tune up neighborhood, kids and first responders bikes in my area. I would love more videos!
After Watching this video I now know for sure that modern MTBs are a headache and must stay as far away feom them as possible. Sticking with single speed gravel bikes.
Seth should have switched them brakes...nice work though
Ive found that throwing the bearings in the freezer   before install helps em slide in better
Got a 2019 canyon strive id sell for 700 for flip bike..lmk
Ha, carbon fibre is an upgrade and stronger than steel, the lie.  You tap on it and it snaps and you have to wait a month to get a used part replacement.  What a joke!  Same with those hydraulic disk brakes. You nick a tube and accidentally open it to the air....no more brakes for you. I guess you could badly kink it as well, which stops the fluid flowing...same thing, no more brakes and people claim that's an upgrade. Really, and upgrade?  Snag a cable actuated brake. Might stretch the wire. You get a spanner or allen key to open the adjustment screw to tension the cable. Tighten down the adjustment screw and away you go in a few minutes but you hear people who have fallen for the marketing blurbs saying "bah hum bug, that's old fashioned"  The improvement in modern bikes are for the incremental gains of competitive racing. Not for recreational riding. Get a heavy duty, hard as nails unit that you could drop off a cliff and still ride home and no one wants to steal because they're only worth 2 bob.  Like old cars that break down in the bush. You can bodge a pretty good repair and keep going with the old car.   You break down in a modern car. You're calling a tow truck and you're out hundreds of dollars for that and the trip is ruined.
These are hands down my favorite videos. I learn so much.
I'm a new subscriber to your channel and I just lost my hard tail MTB (somebody stole it) but your channel helps me move on hahaha thank you so much... Next project is to assemble my new MTB but this time I'll go with full suspension so I can enjoy the trail here in Mongolia.
There's also another machine aluminum piece that you could get for that one up tool kit and it will then tighten from the bottom of the steer tube
lve yer vids
I wish one up would tell you what thread the tap is.
I snapped my down shift lever on my sram eagle nx shifter 😢 does anybody know a way to get the whole lever off and buy a new one or do I have to get a whole new shifter
ah yes, Giant's "Forged Composite". Pretty decent stuff, but it does bend and it does break. It's just pressure formed carbon fiber in an impressive thickness. Odd, given that the rear triangle is aluminum on these bikes. Don't really understand why they made that one part composite, unless its mean to be a bottom-out compliance section.  I had a linkage bearing seize on a Trance. Tweaked the rocker to one side and destroyed the shock within a couple turns. Giant doesn't seem to use much grease inside their full complement bearings. After a season of hard riding and frequent washing, you might need to swap them or at least re-grease. Not quite 97 bearings tho. Just 12. Oh, and you don't need pictures of that particular suspension. There's only one way it'll go together properly. All the spacers are the same size, and the steel adapters for the lower linkage go in such that the cone shape bears on the bearing race not moving when clamped. :P Easy. Or take pictures. I like to place the parts on the bench in the same way they came off the bike, personally.
The hair growth pre and post breakage is so funny
great video! thank you :)
6:41 ASMR 😊
Love these series, helps a lot with fixing my own bikes, currently in the process of completely re-building a hardtail into a 12 speed hybrid gravel/mtb bike. Liv is great, was able to get my mother who is quite short a Liv city bike and its the first bike that actually fits her and allows her to ride normally without having to jump off the saddle any time she wants to stop.
Seth, all good bro but I'm gonna need you to go right ahead and stop growing your hair in-between takes here, if you can get that accomplished this week...that would be great......Guy will literally figure out to do it with bike parts anyway. Great clip, that specialized you did for Mom there is my wife's favorite build! The purple was a great touch.
ngl if i were to get a new bike id give you my old one to overhaul because i dont want it to go to waste
Really interesting to see a follow-up on another bike you've worked on after some wear and tear, more of that if possible! Great build as always.
the dropper post is the same and it has the same problem so i need to know how to fix it 1:03
It's been 2 years, and I'm still waiting for you to tell me why the star nut is so special lol
Old Reverbs sag more than a gangsters pants😂
Hey Seth where can I get a small bearing press kit like that I can never find them that small here in Chandler Arizona
Love what you do…you’re nice. But I do love watching the repair stuff.
Casually puts 800 dollar shock on it 😂😂
Every time there's just that one bolt or nut that just doesn't want to comply....having same issue right now...tomorrow another round 😂
Outstanding.
Just causally giving away carbon wheels. Rough life.
7:45 All steerer tubes should be threaded. I hate tightening my top cap because once I accidentally over tightened one and so now I am nervous every time I do it. There's no torque spec. I had a creaky headset on a bike so I had to make it tight but I was worried I might overtighten it. If the steerer tube was threaded then you could just torque it to like 6Nm or something and jobs done.
HOW MUCH DID THAT COST HER???
9:34 that face 😂😂
Can I take a look in your parts bin?!
And do you have a calendar with all your work commitments when people you know ask about parts and upgrades and stuff???
How much space is in that head tube underneath the multitool, could you stitch some like hanging nets or something to maybe get a CO2 cartridge in there too?
That’s really cool and I’m guessing you got a haircut mid-shoot? 😂
I just wanted to say that I really appreciate the fact that you are a master of your trade. It seems more and more rare, ty.
Wheels : Whatever seths bike hacks has: industry nine hubsss
Nooit im keeping cooked xx1 parts anyday than copping gx
Another 10 years, she did not maintain it well for the first 5 years, what is going to change for the next 10?
Great episode, more of these!
moms dont need that kind bike, dutch bike fits like something in somewwhee
Question, what was that tool you used to remove the star nut?
oh boy you did her wrong with sram brakes
Tag the Hard tail bikers
Heather has a nicer bike then me!
still waiting on that star nut video, btw :/
6:51 im still dying for this video
Can I work for you?😢
Overhaul videos are my favorite of yours. Just love them
Yeah, female specific bikes were first started with the Santa Cruz Juliana. (I believe. Others may have been doing the same thing, but I had never heard of any). It was called that for Juli Furtado, an absolute rock star in mtb, road racing and skiing. A shop where I worked for a bunch of years, called Another Bike Shop, in Santa Cruz, worked very closely with Santa Cruz bikes pretty much from the beginning , starting with the earliest Tazmon. (An original frame designed by none other than Tom Morris himself, still hangs in the shop. She wanted a female specific frame.qAnyway, when they were working on the Juliana, they brought one to our shop to test. They are only about three miles away. Being the towering figure I am at 5’4”, it was put to me to try out. I could definitely feel the difference and could tell the frame dimensions were built for a woman. Little bit longer seat tube for longer legs, little bit shorter reach, thinner handle bars and so on. We also worked very closely with Fox when they were developing mtb forks. I actually had the first retail Fox fork on my first ( of many) Santa Cruz Chameleon single speeds. I’m on my fifth one now, but still a single speed. This one has a Fox 36 on it. I sure wish I still had that first one.😞
What are really good women's bikes? This Liv look good, and Liv is making XS, which is awesome. Sadly bikeshops are not helping with selection.
Seth, why ??? have a lot of YouTube videos 'lately' been inundated  with "Up-Beat music" so distracting from the venue Nice you take care of getting the bike safe & sound
6:40 asmr😌
i love this guy i have been watching him for so long like since 2017
Like wow dude, what was the cost of all those parts and your time?
Can we start a support group for anyone who's had either their wallet, or their mental health, sabotaged by a Reverb?
Where do you sell and buy your bikes?
this clean up rly shoud me that i need a hard tail XD this is rly where hard tail would me finished a month earlyer XD
use oil qhen you thread something
Can you come and break my bike please?
6:40 Mister berm peak later that night after the mom saw how good the bike is
All those bearings make you really want to ride a hardtail.
And your total is 35K dollars mom, 10k in parts and 25k in labor on your 5k dollars bike i sold to you.....
imagine caring so much about a bike and leaving SRAM brakes on it
A big thanks to Seth for some inspiration. When I upgraded by high street MTB to something more trail ready I added some good, cost effective new parts to me old bike to improve it and then sold it cheaply to a young lad in my town. I have since seen him on trails and at a local bike park. I lost a bit of cash selling to him, but watching him ride and enjoy the bike is worth more than the cash value. Big thanks for the inspiration.
that droper lever she had was aewso,me
Seth be like  I’m going to do a free full service which would usually cost 50 dollars 😂
Bro,i have 15 years old SRAM Bike that newer been ripeared,can you ripear it,you can made 5 series wit that bike🙄🤔
Seth i am so glad that you help people get back on their bikes and helping with the things that need to be repaired or replaced I have learned so much from you thank you
My bike is a big Bruh. It is almost to small, it has no suspension, no fancy parts, and weighs a ton.
I did the exact same thing to my Giant Trance when taking out he shock. Luckily for me I was putting it in a new frame though.
Hey seth I know I'm probably about 7 months too late to make this comment, but whenever you need to prevent paint from going inside bearing seats, you can use a rolled up piece of paper or even scrunched up aluminum foil to keep the bearing surface clean. It takes way less time and effort then slightly pushing in an old bearing
i lou full sus bikes 👍❤️
The joy of getting a friend hooked up with the good stuff!
We need more pink bikes.
Is this more a giant trance og reigen?
that bike was better than mine in the begining
Glad to see Mom tearing up the trails and the bike. That bike has character. That's a nice bearing press. I like your bike builds.
Having pressure washer would keep it clean, but then you aren't meant to be bicycle path transport where all your tires wear out. Wondered how hard it is to replace brakes calipers.
I had that old Reverb dropper post, gave me PTSD seeing that shitty button on her bars. I just wrote an essay about how bad that dropper post and how infuriating it was to use, but I don't think anyone wants to read that. Seth should receive some sort of humanitarian award for replacing it.
I have a problem my casset skips the 7st gear and i do not now how to fiks it
same thing happened to me the bike started miss behaving and i tried to take it apart to rebuild it and found a destroyed frame   their was an entire spacer missing between the bottom bracket and i ended up having to retire the bike and get a new one
DAMN YOUR A GOOD WRENCH
So in America you dont have to Restore things you break? Just Replace them with anything to make it work again? Really?
I love that he included the part where the part broke, that some shit that hapens all the time but its cool to see play out infront of yiu
One of my favorite parts when working on bikes is that smooth feeling from moving parts after knowing they felt like a pepper grinder before service.
A cheat to "restore" a bike when the bike already has everything. What a joke.
I’ve ridden my hard tail liv bike for almost 6 years now and I love it! One of the best bikes I’ve owned!
Yeah Seth... we dont buy our bikes to go easy on them! xD
Flat Black looks cheap  Use Satin Black, much nicer finish
can you please build a bike for 800 dollars PLSS
That's one pretty bike you've made a whole lot better. Nice one.  There's so much technology in these modern bikes that I'd be afraid to service them myself without some guidance from people like yourself.
I love rebuilt and cleaning videos :).
Music spoiling great video
Kitsuma is one hell of a trail! I think my friend took me there to convince me I needed to upgrade to full suspension.
change the title to "i serviced a karens bike and i thought carbon parts can be hit with a hammer" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Surprised he didn't replace those damn guide brakes
Cool. I saw a liv MTB the other day. Nice bike 👍
I would love to be this guys neighbor, also have bike that need this kinda stuff, imagine him being your friend and offers to uphrade your bike too🥺
How tall is Seth?
Ride your damn bike
Was that Tusk playing at the beginning? Sounded just like it.
The fastest hair growth ever like😝🤞🤞
My old ProFlex had nylon bushings rotating on anodized aluminum supports. Those things NEVER wore out. After 20 years of riding they still worked great. Dunno why anyone bothers with ball bearings in their suspension linkages. If nothing else you could get Oilite bushings that are made of sintered bronze and have oil embedded in them, so they don't have to be manually lubricated.
12:48 even us 'trained' bike mechanics make this mistake, sometimes. it just happens due to the nice work flow and you forget to really think about it because you just know you'll do it right every time.🤣🤣
the rear tire is good. It grips better for climbing. Many shops do it that way.
Can someone donate to my ass I don’t have money for a good bike I am sad and no that’s not me in the pfp that was 3 years ago
I’ve only seen one major part on my bike be reviewed by Seth and it’s that crank, I’m glad he likes it too 😅
i love his face when he turned the i9 bro😂
bros just spent like twice as much as my whole bike is worth on his dog groomers bike
Reverb in seatposts are only bad from last year and before don't wanna rap on supports but dangle there toes in fire just a bit like Xbox get you products in order pro controller stuck drift seat post reverb related who knows maybe a conspiracy....
Nice f u to whom ever for the linkage brake incident not soo discreetly.
I have a 1998 mongoose a40r. Frame and wheels are near perfect. Lines are gone. Has 3×7 shimano transmission. I saw a recall on the 105 ballistics forks. Is the frame worth upgrading or should i just scrap it and hunt down something higher end?
Always seeing new tools to do stuff, I did learn it the hard way before
Love the water table on the bike washing station.
What spray paint do you use? All the paints I've tried scratch so easily
Hi berm Peak!! I’m a big fan I am really happy Christmas is around but I’m looking for a used mtb that I could upgrade maybe flip but my parents don’t agree. What can I do and I would like a full sus a hardtail is alright I do want an upgrade because im on a Walmart bike a schwinn ranger to be specific I don’t know what to do😅😂  but im hoping I could get some help and I like cheap bikes I fit. Want like Santa Cruz or something no im ok with budget full sus just not a Walmart one please and thanks
İ like this format..... 👍
So I know this isn’t related to this video but what happens when you pair a oval sprocket to a e bike does it improve performance and make it smother or does it make it worse
Hi,  what size of thread do you need for the shaft to install the oneup wrench
Hey ☺️ do you think hardtail are better bikes for beginner? Despite the Price? I often see you on a hardtail, I was wondering. I have a double suspension but I think to sell it for a hardtail to work on my skills
Bro I am jealous right now I am riding a 20 year old trek bike from 1976
Love that you touched on how Giant makes women's bikes differently than their men's bikes. Giant is overlooked far too often. They make their own frames. They even smelt the metal they use to make their frames so they get the exact blend they want. They do this with their carbon as well. They start with the fabric and weave it themselves so they can control flex points how they want. This comes into play for women's, and men's frames. You mentioned data being collected and they do this for all the different sizes. Then they take that data and weave the carbon so it's stronger where it needs to be because power output is different for different sized riders. When Giant says it's a woman's bike, that's because it was designed for a woman. It's not just a paint job and touch points. It's crazy how much Giant puts into a bike and they're cheaper than these other companies that have other companies make their frames overseas.
It’s literally a giant trance with colours it’s not really a new frame
bro i wish someday this man take my bike and rebuild it 🥺❤️
i love my liv road bike! cool to see one featured on your channel
I have a bike you could do this too I ride really hard it would be perfect I live in hendo
Great video! Would love to see what you could do with my 2005 Giant Reign 2!
Damn, I never seen a bike that new look that bad
I like that bike
I wish I lived closer to Seth.   I could drop off my 20+ year old Trek hardtail and pick up something much closer to his new Rail when I got back.
I love my brand new Walmart, Schwinn Axum large frame. I love the gold sparkles in the paint this bike is so fast all quick release and it is dropper post ready this bike is so fast.
I love how you fix bikes I live in Phoenix Arizona. I wish you could fix my bike for tuneups or whatever and upgrades. Please tell me if you’re interested I usually go to Landis Cyclery in Phoenix Arizona but I think you’re a lot more professional I would rather do business with you forever.
Seth I have my evil following sitting in my spare room catching dust .. needs link overhaul 😢… drivetrain replacement…small frame ..
I like the bearing press anybody know what it is
Too bad cane creek suspension sucks
Great video. I have a Giant Stance and it is one of the most comfortable rides ever. And, it is ready for some suspension upgrades after some rough COVID years. I'm encouraged to take these on now. Thx!
I’d love for the opportunity to have Seth do this with my bike. I don’t have the tools or space to do some of the necessary maintenance on my bike, and I don’t have a parts bin to replace some of my more worn out parts.
Love this video, all these parts are way overkill, I'm looking forward to a RockShox Monarch rear shock rebuild. Keep up the great work Seth!
I got a pair of old triple clamps n have them for a long time n haven't been able to use them cuz of the seals n missing a spring was wondering if you could help me out with a website for parts would appreciate it greatly
hey i would love if you where to make me a bike:) i live in Australia and i have a trek marlin 5 right now with the shifter and the brake together so it limits some upgrades. my brakes do not work, i have to put all my strength into the leaver just to slow down and its becoming a problem on the trail. my suspension dose not work well and its becoming a hazard for my safety. i hope we can talk farther and see if i can give you an offer.
Thats a rad Mommy bike!
I think she let this one sit in a bush overnight during a rainstorm a time or two lol.
hey! extra wheel?
its for heather?\
😉👍🌻
idk why but the 1x drivetrain looks like a 16 GB pc ram but the 3x a 64gb ram
Ow dude that reminds me of my Giant Trance 1.5 ....such a fine ride
th
12:58 it does hapend.
I had a reverb seat post of my old bike and it completely seezed up, I swore to never ride one again. Not to mention changing a cable is a lot easier then bleeding
Hello. Love what you are doing. Just wanted to see if you hand content you’d recommend for buying a used full suspension mountain bike for beginners. I’m looking at Santa Cruz bikes from Bout 4 to 5 years old. What should we be looking out for and is the technology still ok?
Hey seth! I have a video idea for ya, you should get a trashed bike from the dump or the  scrap yard, fix it up and see what you can make from it I thought that would be cool to watch lol. Btw love your videos! Have a nice day
I need this done to my 26" bike!!! Very nice video as always!
Hey Seth, I'm a big fan of the channel! I have a question, do you know why my rear tyre keeps deflating? I replaced the inner tube but it still leaks air.. any advice will be appreciated!
Servicing the bike... Or just rebuild it with new parts
I love that I found this channel. Makes me want to get back into mountain biking after all these years. I can't afford a bike yet due to the debts I incurred after losing my business but I'm going to save up what little I can until I can afford something 🙏
It’s a decent crankset but if you land on it wrong the way the threads will strip out lol
Awesome video Seth!  I ride a Liv Intrigue and absolutely love it.  Thank you for acknowledging that Liv is one of the very, very few companies that actually designs bikes for women from the ground up.  I've ridden my Intrigue and the equivalent Trance, and they really do feel like different bikes, with my Intrigue not only feeling like it fits like a glove, but also just feeling so much more powerful and efficient while riding it than the Trance did.  I'm proud to ride a bike from a company that promotes their women athletes as much as their male athletes and that works so hard to get more women on bikes period.  If it makes you feel any better, I did the same thing to my linkage when I was replacing the bearings in it.  Luckily, Liv/Giant has such amazing customer service and warranty that I had a brand new, perfectly matching, part in my hands in 4 days.  This kind of service (not to mention the crazy bang for your buck on these bikes) is why a Liv bike will always be my first choice!  Would love to know how she likes her bike now!
Hii sir hmmm brake set
God i love and hate your content , i love what you do , i hate that i cant afford it
seth i see you have a problem and i want to help you help yourself, a few weeks ago you said you had too many bikes and i understand, i will happily fly over from the UK to collect a bike or two off you, this is what friends like me are for, i will allways be here for you if you need to give me a bike
Hi Seth, can you do a new video for beginners i want to choose a new bike and i am very puzzled. :)
I think this is going to be a useful video for a lot of us.
I love this! I always encourage people to save some money rebuilding their old bikes, I usually end up doing it for them.
Everyone comment airbag video
Hi seth have you heard about "Duke raker" enduro  frames. I hope you make Video of it the future
הכוס של אמא שלך בטח המצב של הבן שלו
I want my first proper mountain bike but on a really tight budget i want one of the seats that go up and down whilst riding in the uk what do you recomend
My reverb dropper post has sagged already bike is only a few months old with barely any use
Hey Seth, I have a suggestion for you. I'm sure you use mag pads to map your screws/bolts when disassembling something? I run an electronics hardware repair business and am often bouncing between multiple repairs to maximize efficiency. This means those mag pads are a life saver. But nearly all of them are complete trash in terms of how magnetic they are.   The only one I've used that is actually good was actually a free addon when I bought an electronic tech screwdriver from Xiaomi, the 'wow pad.' You can actually place 20 screws on there in a particular layout, flip it upside down and shake the thing. They just don't move, it's great.   What I'd really like to see is you testing different mag pads as a segue into a bike repair. Help me find ones that don't suck. Even iFixit who makes great tech products has an awful mag pad.   Just food for thought and I feel your viewerbase would enjoy some nerdy tool stuff here and there :)
this bike can even go for another 15 years the only time it will its line is there is no parts available or supported
This was so fun to watch--kudos to Seth for being such a great guy!
You're videos have helped me fix up/clean/take care of my cheap mtb and i'm really grateful, thanks!!
I miss seths bike hacks :(
the seatpost make better subpenion :)
Hot tip - put a towel/rag over any bearings, cups etc. you're punching out to save yourself firing tools and bearings across the workshop.
Can you please review the trek precaliber 24 inch with suspension
What brand of dropper post is that? I’m looking to change my hard tail to full suspension
Hi I’m from India I’m 14 years old I’m new here I want to get into mountain biking. I want a used full suspension bike for a low price do u know one or do u have one ? My budget is really low . Pls help me find one or if ur are kind enough pls donate me one. Plsssss
What do I do if cassette is being stobourn and not coming out
Berm Peak...Any thoughts about reviewing Devel frame?
Hey would a Carbon Aluminum mongoose mtb from the 90’s interest you? it weighs like 25 ibs with all the shitty components so i imagine sub 25 ib hardtail might be of interest
How much did that all cost including the parts?
My rear is on backward.... (Edit:  uhhh my rear tyre that is)...   q8}  But it's my previous front (Maxxis DHF) so I reverse them as the breaking force only on the front they are designed for is reversed to the drive force on the rear. I run the rear till it's getting quite rounded even on black trails as i find I corner a little better with a rear I can slide a little easier...  As for grip, I videoed a black trail that has a lot of roots and there's only one pinch climb over a tree base that I miss... and that's just my pathetic energy level. I did pinch flat the last tyre as I was inadvertently running it at 15PSI but You can see how slick it is as I stop and check out the flat in my "Others riding the Hospital jumps" video. Nothing worse than sitting out a session with both the bike and spare tyre flat... Who packs a tube with a puncture.... Me apparently!
Thank you man!
Dude Seth you totally make a cement pool skate park behind your garage or in the woods for your bmx/dirt jumper bikes just a suggestion!
Any chance someone knows what tool he used for this bearings? Taking out and putting in.
The hair growth 🤣 haha
Since the video is about maintenance, does anyone know why the wheel on a marlin 4 keeps coming loose? I tightened up the QR, but after a ride or two the wheel is about to fall
Very entertaining and motivating video!!! It gave me courage to do some maintenance on my own bike. Keep the videos coming, great content.
Hey Seth! I broke my dirt jumper frame. Can you give tips for saving up?
I can't wait to see the custom baby bike for your kid
Seth, could you give me a quick answer to a question about a bike and the price its at? Its a Trek Marlin 5 Gen 2, for $808. Is that worth it? I have been googling for a few days now and still no closer to knowing, whats a good bike and the prices I'm looking at, I understand through my research that the shocks on almost all lower end bikes are kinda crap and hydrolic breaks are better. and that if I can get a bike with good geometry that I can add onto it slowly with better parts. I just don't know what is the ebst "Frame" so so speek to buy. If you can help that would be great. If someone else from comment section can help, that would also be great n_n tyvm in advance.  Edit: I mainly just want to get a bike that doesn't make a whole bunch of noise when I'm riding it and that can handle harder stuff but not like SUPER extreem downhill stuff. "Hope Im saying this right, I only have like a week of youtube videos to go off of"
I would love to see you get a dirt bike. Please 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏  get one. Get a honda crf 150 or a kawasaki kx112. Please  🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏 🙏  I would love to see that content
Cool bike.  But, watching you with those bearings and linkage on a 5 year old bike confirms for me that a hardtail is a much better option for those that want a bike they can just hop on and ride without a lot of work.
Wait what?!? Carbon linkage on an alu bike? Really?
Great video, though I was looking forward to seeing the rear shock and the dropper post serviced instead of replaced. But I guess it's best to just upgrade for those that can afford it.
Hey Seth I was thinking if you could make a best bike part upgrades from 50 dollars to 500 dollars like some of the old videos, I would like to see what you recommend for certain budgets
If you ever need someone els to groom your dog 😁 I'm in ........oh and I have a bike that need looking at if your free!?
Can the multi tool be put in a carbon steterer?
Why do you have like 30 instagram pages
when is the next trail build vid love those
NX Eagle is my fave part of my bike. She'll love it!
i want that thing for bearings, where can i get it?
What brand is that smaller bearing puller
At minute 10:40 I said: rear tire is blackwood.:-?  No...   End of the video Aaaa It was.  :))) Nice upgrade!
Least I know I'm not the only one to set a tire on backwards after giving effort not to.
i wonder if seth is fully cytec qualified lol
Hi Seth i want to get a new Bike and i want to wheelie a lot so do you know a bike thats good for that
i like the bike after its done
👍
This was an amazing video! More of these please!!!
i have on of those! Mine is gray.
I've been watching your videos for a little bit now but I just learned that I ride with the same community you used to ride with in South Florida. We'd love to see ya at Critical Mass some day!
hay seth i was wondering what is a good price range for a begeners moutan bike
just sad to buy such a bike and don't do regular maintenance on it. That should be insisted again and again that it's bad to run a bike for years with almost no maintenance...
Those linkeages should never have been bearings in the first place. Bearings are intended to cycle. A linkage never does 360 degrees. Linkeages should be bushings.
Seth I have a broken collarbone from a mtb crash a couple days ago. What’s fun to do with a broken collarbone?
seth whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Maybe every now and again clean your bike. Help her with that advice
I want to overhaul the rear links and suspension of my canyon nerve xc6 but unfortunatly I couldn't find a clue on how to do it or where to get parts here in Germany ,if you can help me seth please ?
Hey Seth, I got my bike stolen 2 weeks ago and your videos just makes me want to get on one. Thanks for making these amazing videos !
Do you have a cat i can groom? 🤣
watched it in 4k, (usually watch it in 1080) and i cant stop staring at seth's beard lol.
I wish I could find Mazza in France :(  ordered 9 month ago, still waiting
No service for front fork? I guess with this condition of bike it has never been done...
I recently did the tyre on backwards thing, my tyre has a giant white arrow with ROLLING DIRECTION printed on it too. Then I installed a new seatpost, realised I had it backwards so I took it off and fitted it again only to realise I still had it the wrong way when I looked at the bike in the morning.
Now I just want to be Heather
Can you post a link for the bearing removal kit you use in this video.  Awesome job fixing the bike up.
Can you get a 29er titanium hardtail from Nukeproof or something or maybe try out an xc downcountry bike like epic evo or scott spark
casual convo cuts to him wacking
Whats been difference between seg and sag
Anyone else think that seth is totally screwing the dog groomer? Crank bros/i9 wheelset, cane creek shock etc??
Awesome
Bike Before - Nice, older bike, solid after a wash. Bike Now - Complete and utter TRASH.... the rear tire is on backwards.
Seth the way u just put my dream parts in this shitty bike makes me wanna kms
Hi seth!! IAM a fan from Philippines
I really like this type video. Upgrade all your friends bikes.
I can’t understand the logic of using cartridge ball bearings of that size in such an area where they’ll get absolutely contaminated with dust and dirt within minutes. Why not just use nice phosphor bronze bearings instead ??
Glad I’m not the only one putting wheels backwards 😂
Hi Seth, an other amzing service video. Could you please  make a video where you go into detail where you buy replacement parts, like the bearings, and also make like tutorials on the services you do on these bikes? Cheers
next wedsrfg brs rfd s
drgd g
sad bike the ressestoran very hear hast fast xd nice as rg
hahahahaha that was hilarious you put rear tire on backwards lol
Why didn't put the chain guide back on?
Omg when you mentioned drivetrain I hate the drivetrain on my Carrera valour it’s on its 3rd derailleur and the most I’ve used it on grass
the kittsuma is like the best shock for people who own giants and livs works so well with the suspenion layout
Valve stem nuts to keep the brake bolts and spacers captive….. I was this years old. 🤯
You should fix up a old bmx to do 540s
Milf?
Seth you are dope
Great job Seth for bringing that Hail back to life!   If anyone wants info contact me as I work at Middle of Town cycling in Louisville Ky and we are a liv/ Giant dealer.
I put the rear tire on backwards a while ago and just never changed it👍
9:33 😀
Hey Seth, I have a Giant with busted bearings also, where did you get the bearing kit? I will check the RRP press!  Thanks
where did you get that kit of bearing extractors and presses? I have looked for ways to purchase it on line but have found nothing available.
its nice to see bike updates like that ! keep it coming ! you do good for people!
He didn't brake the linkage by hammering, he got desperate to get it out and he knew he could get a part online.....
A great episode!
Seth can you share the part number for that shock I cant seem to find one for my Giant build
Nice work Seth!! We are gonna hit berm park soon!
I felt good, happy watching this. Thank you.
What's that crank on the hardtail?
This is my favorite channel, and I love just sitting down and watching it everyday.This channel is very informational and entertaining. Thanks for all your time and hard work.
Seth try ultrasonic cleaning some of the small bits!
There are really good money in restoring used Giant mountainbikes. I bought a Giant XTC Advanced 27.5" for only $600. Literally most bikes with a good drivetrain for few money will pay off.
Why don't you put teflon grease on those bearings?? It will make them last more and protect to grime and water!!! Otherwise in two yeaes at last will be useless again.
…
It’s interesting to see how quick new gear wears out. I have Norco mountain bikes with over 10 thousand km’s on them with original chains, no issue changing gears.
How to service a bike: Throw everything away and buy new stuff. Got it.
I'm sorry to say, a high end bike calls for a high end paint job. That is not going to look good for those 10 years you were talking about in the beginning. I'd recommend you to check out Etoe's channel for a high quality paintjob
please tell me you flipped the tyre round the right way
Giant dealers keep like 30 of them on hand
I stopped the video at 2:39 cause it reminds me of how weak those giant linkage are the carbon one break when u tru taking the bearings out
It's too easy to put the geometry and measurements side by side between the reign and the hail.
First I need to be your dog groomer ;) Second, eww, NX?
I’m famous for the ole mount the tire backwards after carefully looking at it and telling myself not to.  😂
Absolutely love your build videos!
Really enjoying the latest content Seth, thanks for keeping it interesting (and educational)!
Hi I wanted to get into bike restoration and flipping all I wanted to ask is a list of all the tools needed to get in to this activity
Awesome video! Like always. But I have one question am getting a pollygon D6 sometime this year and I was wondering if you have any suggestions for upgrades? And also wondering what do you think of that bike?
Ending is hilarious! 🤣
These are my favourite one of my favourite videos to watch!!
Seth just wanted to use that blue one up insert. ;) I have that and the same pedals. I didn't tap my fork headset kept coming loose. The new version is better.
That dropper post is a feature I’d love to have
No way??? Her reverb wasn’t working???? Who is surprised
Good ole maestro
Maybe your next promotion should be an overhaul bike for a winner…just an idea 😁
Does anybody else remember “blinker bike” where Seth strapped hundreds of blinking lights to a bike! I wanna see that on a night ride sailing down berm peak!!! I can’t be the only one!
To every detail I can see, that is the same frame as the `Giant Trance`, which is IMO a good one.
My gf has had 2 livs an intrigue and a hail, both good bikes then went with a juliana after finding an absolute bargain on a new carbon frame which means i spent the day swapping every part from the hail to the juliana. Also cane creeks website was a massive help for the headset
Seth over here upgrading everything haha 😄
I can tell just from the video that the pivots are way better
What tool was he using for the pivot bearings
Do you have PIVOT bikes?
Please help guys I have a Carrera hellcat 2020 I love the bike but I hate the hydraulic breaks is there anyway I can install v breaks or cantilevers ? The bike frame dose not have the holes to install them however is there anyway to do this ? Any help is appreciated.  P.s I know most people prefer the hydro breaks I really don’t so no one try and convince me otherwise :)
Is that stamp pedal not threaded all the way in?
Hello, I'm new to mountain biking and I bout a used 2015 santa cruz heckler, it came with the rockshox reverb and it does that sag thing. I get that it's not supposed to do that but is there anything bad other than that? Like can it stop working if I don't fix it?
“Hello again, I’m back, I’ve got the same shirt on, but my hair has grown considerably,”:Just Seth casually giving us the bird 🦅
Relieved to only own hardtails. 😅
Someone please tell Heather she can quiet down those angry bees behind her with a tiny bit of grease.
Day 2 of asking seth to ride his backyard trails on a cross country motorcycle
No grease on the frame bearings? They'll be getting stuck in the frame then.
This reminds me of the first time I set my gravel bike up tubeless and I put the rear tire on backwards, twice.  Made quite a mess of my apartment and I had to make a second trip to REI to purchase more tape and sealant.
Are you going to get a new hardtail
Great vid, I laughed pretty hard when you broke the rocker link cause I did the same thing years ago on a customers bike while removing the bearings great times
Me fixing my bike:  "Oh no it will come close to $50. I'm going bankrupt."  Him fixing someone's bike: "Indistry Nine hubs ☑️, whole new drivetrain ☑️, +++"
With this bike Seth has officially taken the Flip Bike profit to -$1200 or something
These videos are like crack. It's hard to get my fat a*s up to do sh*t when I start watching them. Not too mention, saving money learning how to work on my own bike.
His parts bin is insane!
Why not include a lower leg service on the fork?
I want Seth to overhaul my old bike!
Save money on those expensive Bearings: Remove the seals with a dental pick, clean (blast) with an aerosol cleaner like Brake clean or even WD-40, re-grease, check for smoothness. If the bearing checks good, re-install the seals and move on to the next one. Saves tons of money and lengthens the life of the bearings. Some bearings will be too far gone, but you'll be able to save most of them.
Rider: "My bike rides like shit and feels awful" Other rider: "Well have you cleaned or serviced it since you got it?" Rider: "... crickets..."  To be fair this applies to plenty of other things too, but they're often the same people.
You’re a star nut
I just bought my wife a liv embolden she loves it and it shows in your riding her confidence has tripled an all she wants to do is ride anymore
Bringing old bikes back to life is a good thing. Unless it has a steel frame.
I have been looking for a good bearing remover and press for a while where can I find the one you used?
Goes out to garage and looks at bike, immediately comes back inside and starts drafting a friend application to send to Seth.  lol
I had a Trance of this vintage, and it was bombproof. I only did the bare minimum for service and did not pamper it, yet over 4 years is still the only full suspension bike I've owned that didn't creak ever. I only sold it to a buddy because I wanted a 29er, and to this day it's still been trouble free for him too!
7:35 It’s so odd hearing Americans using metric units. It’s like my brain refuses to believe it’s the same millimetres most of the world uses.
Nice job 👌
Put some cutting oil on your tap
my bike just got owned by this "mom bike"
Nice
I’m so happy to see a Liv on your channel it’s what I’ve been riding and it looks just as beat up as this one in the beginning 😅
Another awesome video and learned so much of it! Amazing content as always!
4:13 Sorry dude but if i gave my bike to fix, it better come back exactly the same colour as i gave it to you. This is a fail and rude AF. And witching out the seatpost becuase you couldn't be bothered to service it right is just lazy. If i was the owner of this bike I would be pissed
Hey Seth have you tried using a steam cleaner to get those super tight spots?
seth, that backward tire is just classic 😂😂😂😂
How do you find the fight type of derraileur hanger?
Me literally sitting in front of giant bike with this exact linkage as you break it....👁️👄👁️
The Cane Creek shock is a huge upgrade.  Once she dials it in she should love the support and ride it gives.  Nice video.
I have a Giant Talon with a remote lockout on a  Suntour fork that has crapped out on me if you wanna take a crack at it 😊
Very curious if there is any geometry difference to the Giant Trance of the same year or if it is literally just pink because girl.
The whole bike is aluminum and they put a carbon linkage. 😂 Also Sram NX Eagle derailleur is shit. It starts having ghost shifting because it's entirely made out of plastics. Even a cheap 9 speed shimano is mostly metal.
Hi berm just watching you from Africa🇰🇪🇰🇪 you doing grt job buddy👊👊
Can you brand and name the mounting anti seize paste you use on a toothbrush in this video?
yessss an overhaul
can you do a video on a fixie/single speed bike. would be cool to see you work on/restore one compared to your classic mountain bike
I wish we could see the owners reactions when they get their bikes back Great video!
Woman bike’s are getting better parts, for example, my wife has a cube racebike and it has shimano 105 on it with where the levers are closer to the steer because woman have most of the time smaller hands than men. Good they are getting more and more attention to de details!
I only just bought 20 star nuts from ali. Dammit
I’m blown away that an aluminum frame uses a carbon rocker link.
😱 Explain me how this 5yo MTB look likes total trash. Even my 15yo enduro who sleep outside and which I ran over with my truck doesn’t look this much disgusting ahahah. How lool she supposed to be a dog cleaner. Clean your bike !!!! 😱😂😂
I still want to see the service on the shock and dropper - as a technical quandary more than anything else.
upload a build please
Reminds me of muc off
Momtainbike
Bought my wife the same Hail. She's used it three times. Every month I pump the tires up and wash it. Every six months I pump up the shocks. I swear when my current Enduro breaks I'm just going to paint the Hail black and tell her it's my new bike, she'll never notice.
Servicing a bike for someone that has neglected his/her bike that much so far is incomprehensible. Also that shock is not beginner-friendly at all and I'd assume the owner has little to no experience adjusting a bike suspension.
Saw the reverb in the intro and instantly thought, that’s wanked.  They are nice for the first 2 month of service but god they are an expensive mistake.  £80 Brand X accent goes up n down more reliably than most reverbs I’ve come across.
One thing about Seth he will include that stem mounted multi tool in the vid by any means necessary
I, too, have put the rear tire on backwards after checking multiple times to make sure I had it right.
oh man... the amount of times i've installed cushcore on a DH casing maxxis tire just to realize that it's backwards once i complete the installation is painful. working in a bike shop can be amazing and awful at the same time
These hail/reigns of this generation (2018ish) are tough as nails. I’m surprised seth didn’t opt for the cascade link for this as it likely would have been easier to track down.
I would have never guessed that the linkage would be carbon, would have assumed cast aluminum or something metallic with a full aluminum frame build MTB.
Again, so impressive to watch. I learn a lot, its just wonderful!   But im really struggling atm with my bike. I ended up pulling out the outer housing for my dropper post on a stumpjumper alloy 2019. And I dont know how to route the cable again, Even with a routing kit.. could you make a more detailed section in a video, where you tell what you do?   Greetings Denmark
Heaver Munive is the owner?
I"m jealous ans suck at the same time. I have to provide all materials and labor for my bike repair/refresh. Whatever.
Your channel has become an infomercial from the early 90s. Repairing is a lot cooler than just magically swapping sponsored parts.
Im in to roadbiking but i still watch this channel
love to see you take one from trash to cash
That black rocker bugs.
Nahh the reverb is just a suspension seatpost
Literally clean the crap out of it 😳. Youre supposed to ride AROUND the cow pies
Alloy bike with a carbon rocker link , would have thrown me off as well.
I have a Giant Trance 2018 and my rocker cracked in the exact same place in 2020. I heard creaking for weeks before taking it to the bike shop. You couldn't see the crack until the whole rocker was taken off. It then took 7 months to get a new one over covid!
Am I the only one that prefers when Seth fixes up old crusty hardtails over high end bikes 😅
love these inexpensive cranksets that are basically the same stuff that costs over 3 times it's price just because of a brand sticker lol
I was yelling at my phone saying the rear tire is backwards lmao
Ummm, can you do this for my bike Seth?? 😍       🤪
Can you put a link to that bearing puller you used. I have been looking for a decent one. Thanks!
Can you do a vid on all the new tools that you have
Where’s the matching water bottle? The captive 10?
Yo Seth you should do a bike check on your old Trek 4900.
Livery of the Liv
I especially enjoyed this episode -- I have that exact Liv Hail!  Mine is more of a backup/Bike Park bike for me.  Main ride is a Liv Pique -- 2017 was an BIG year for me and new bikes!  Thanks for all you do -- I really enjoy your channels.
I laughed at people fitting tyres backwards…right up until I fitted my first cushcore and you guessed it, fitted the tyre backwards 🤦🏻‍♂️ Tubeless sealant everywhere and some pumped forearms later and I was back to normal with a whole lot of sympathy for the mistake 😂
Awesome you are rebuilding that bike, however, the owner totally neglected it.
Looks shmick! Good to go for another few years 👍
God bless you berm peak
We need a long time review of the Kent trouavaille
Like that bearing press you’re using. Who makes it?
Hi seth! Im a big fan of urs since 2017 im just wondering if you have some bike parts that u dont use anymore can u give it to me? Im from the Philippines btw thanks!
This channel is so unbelievably awesome.
Can't say how many tires I've put on backwards....on video as well.  #facepalm
Wow I am very surprised that Seth actually damaged something along the way, well it is what it is, and that's the reason I don't own a full-suspension bike.
I'm pissed you literally destroyed a part of a person's bike and instead of taking the time to do anything to match the paint you painted it black and put it back on a maroon frame, no it does not match it looks like a hot pile of shit if you had done that with my bike I would make you redo it all over again
12:35 yeah I'd wish I could have fun and upgrade my bike and not caring about the costs..
Tire on backwards too many times.
Mountain biking rule # 3,075.....If it rolls it is good.
Haircut lookin sharp Seth!
I know it’s not flip bike but would still be interesting to see how much was poured into this build.
Let's be honest, if your that far into mountain biking you should know how to fix your bike. At least adjust the derailleur
I noticed Seth using some regular wd-40 to loosen some linkage bolts and I just wanna point out that using aero kroil instead as it works better and maybe you could have gotten the bolt saving the time waiting for a new linkage part. But I don’t want this to seem like I’m a know it all. Just a little tip
I've never been so happy to have a hard tail
those bearings feel nasty because they only ever move about a quarter turn with weight on them. that feel is meaningless. they are worn in on one side which is to be expected. they just needed cleaned and maybe pressed with some new grease, they were likely perfectly fine for the application.
love the build 🤘
I love it. Would love to score myself a set of i9's for my Sync'r. That angry bee noise from that hub is just phenomenal.
Honestly, it's just plain cool to see Seth tricking out this bike to take care of and surprise someone who does a wonderful service for him. Seth is definitely someone that you want to be good to because when he returns the favor you are in for a real treat.
This is what we call "reemed"
Your definition of 'shot' bearings is different than mine. My 'shot' bearings usually fall out then I have to punch out the outer race 🤣🤔
Seth had already ran out of free fur trims for Oscar out of the previous hardtail deal and made sure to get another full year on the house LOL!
Hey Seth I have a 2016 Django, can you overhaul my bike too?? 😉
Is it just me or are there more people who notice the different tools Seth is using
Thanks for the vid, the rebuild/upgrades are by far my favorite - keep up the great work!
One up component edc. The small one that u don’t screw in is terrible I had one on mine and I had to get it out to put a fork on and I couldn’t get it out I had to use a knife and a hammer and snap the hole thing and rip knock it out the bottom of my forks
I hate giant. I used to work for them and a broke rocker is one of the main things that break on every single on. We had a guy that used to come in every month to get a new one because he rode every day and in the end we had to get him an aloy one
9:33 now that is a face of true happiness
Could a tire company please put the directions arrows in a color!
Oscar is about to get the full rockstar treatment for life!
Kitsuma is the best trail and probably a great shock
Awesome video. Personally, I would have preferred to see the used parts overhauled rather than replaced. Most of us don't have a parts bin full of replacement seatposts, rear shocks, derailleurs, and wheels!
Alway's good video !!!
$2500 upgrades on functional parts 👍
Seems like a case of neglect and lack of maintenance, even one trip to the LBS somewhere along this bikes life would have avoided half of this. No pride in the bike it seems like, if you got time to ride you got time to service. My .02
Why were all these bearings so cooked after 5 years of (I presume) fairly light use? What could have been done to avoid this?
a little bit different but kinda the same a little bit the same but kinda different kinda different but a little bit the same kinda the same but a little bit different
stop with this garage scam vids
and oscar got the best haircut after that.
Bearing are a waste of money, I keep mines a little ruined and change them only when they have free play
These types of videos are fun as well but I miss the trail building and whistler trips
I actually like this a considerable ammount more than the flip bike series. It's not that I dislike the latter but it kinda plants the illusion of you buying and selling bikes as some sort of crazy merchant.  I also find that the real "profit" you make is kinda questionable. On the other hand everyone loves upgrading bikes and showing how much value a bike can provide when shown a bit of love. Anyways, please keep up the great Work (Your videos are almost cinematic)
I will be sending you my Pinarella with Campagnolo EPS 11 sp  for an "overhaul". Thanks in advance. : - )
It's amazing how dated that paint job is, and it's not even that old of a bike. I loved watching it get fully tuned up, though.
Carbon is great because it just... breaks.
nice
anyone who has a saggy reverb, turn ur bike upside down with the dropper extended, then while upside down press the lever and push the bike down and the dropper back in. do it until the sagging stops, this worked for me until i upgraded bikes :)
I need more on the history and impact of the Star Nut.
Hey Seth. Love the content and enjoy watching your videos. I was curious how people go about contacting you in reference to getting a bike in for you to work on. I am retired military and have an old Trek Marlin 6 that I used to ride a lot but it has seen better days and I would love to see it brought back to life on your channel. Not looking for a free ride of course. Keep up the good work 🤙🏼.
Good work,  solid overhaul - a different bike!  That pivot breaking was unfortunate (not matching  would drive me crazy!) but with all the other upgrades,  I don't think she'll mind, lol.  You're a stand up guy, Seth! 👍
Great upgrades! Nice work (as usual)! Last time, we froze the stuck shaft/axle with a can of compressed air and got it out that way.
Sagging reverb ....shocking 🤣🤣🤣
Mom put in some miles!
I like the video
They don't "give you the tap", you buy it at a big mark up.
Seth this is the perfect complement to Flip Bike ... Only makes sense to make a profit on Flip Bike, but what's missing on the internet is what if you buy or have an average bike and wanna put a few hundred $$$ on it. Love this "series."
Seth would you buy a 99’ specialized stump jumper FRS XC?
Oneup doesnt “Give” you a tap, they are gracious enough to sell you one.
Liv bikes are amazing, and better than giant bikes in my opinion, Liv definitly  does it right
Hey is a polygon d6 a good mountain bike
Great video, as always. I hope people won't get mad at me but man, that sprayed link -- it's an eyesore. I couldn't look away from that thing. I know you replaced and upgraded many things on that bike. But if that was my bike it would keep bothering me.
Tbf this is actually a really nice bike
Been here since you had a closet full of bikes in Florida. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. You're a gem of a human being. The videos are a nice bonus.
That's not bike u gave her a while ago
How about a blind test to see if you can tell the difference between tires mounted correctly and tires mounted backwards. I bet you can’t tell. The problem would be not looking at the tire to see how it is mounted.
Love the colours on that bike!
12:47 oh the number of times I've put a tyre on the wrong way round 100% confident I've put it on right, only to realise the thread's wrong. Glad I've got some tyres now that don't puncture.
Gentleman and scholar.
the edc tools always led to creaking on my headsets, across all of my bikes (and others' bikes too). might wanna watch out for that!
I didn't liked flip bike videos but i absolutely loved this!!!
Makes not allot of sense to me. You’ve put a shock that doesn’t need a tool to seit it up, although the mom have no idea how to do that. But then again you put a multi tool into the steer tube. And all the interesting rebuilds you didn’t did them. Not really consistent
Hey  How can i do an Oil change in my sram breaks ? Having a bit of trouble
ur a nice guy m8 !! kudos
badass
Love stuff like this, youve inspired me to do alotof my own work. What's the product you apply with the toothbrush before placing the bearings?
really bummed you didnt fix the reverb, i have the same issue
About 30 minutes ago I trashed the shock mount on a ktm dirtbike and had to buy a whole new swingarm. This makes me feel much less alone in my dejectedness... 😁
Bro Drive train is a grand
'now lets see what else is carbon!'
The very definition of ‘used and abused’. Great work Seth 🔥👊🏼
What is the name brand on the bearing install and removal tool.
bro how this mum got a better bike than me 💀
I think Seth will have that grease toothbrush for the rest of his life
why did You change a sram horizon for sram nx (it is a downgrade), why did You use cheaper bearings, why did You replace lighter rear shocks for heavier one
Yo seth you great
My wife has a Cube WLS Access, also a womens specific frame design, which she feels much more comfortable on. You can really feel the differences when you ride it compare to another Cube we have (a mans LTD Race). Well worth searching out.
That is why you're not just taking a picture of your work in progress, you have to take a video of it also, so that you won't be able to put the back tire backwards hahaha jk. I Iove it
Tell her not to pressure wash the bike after use. I bet 75% of the wear came from that.
great service you provide for people who don't give a damn about their bikes..! 🤣😂🤣
I changed the suspension bearings in my old Giant Trance a few years ago. They were equally thrashed.
Bike is phresh nice job on the linkage easily done
In think that dropper post might just be one with suspension built in, I sell those at my bike shop
Great video!
should have giver her the beagle🤣 (cause she's a dog groomer)
I bought my trek in 03' and I'm still riding it in 22'
we've all checked and double checked and then put a rear tyre on backwards.
Szacun za materiał :)
Why has there been no trail video's on this channel for a while? Did they move them?
I must be the only person that can successfully put stuff together cross threaded, backwards, upside down, and inside out.   That's why I watch these videos.
Wheel on backwards is literally the worse
For best results, store your *RockShox Reverb* securely in the _trash._
I thank this man for getting me into mountain biking 💪🐐
we need a link for that crankset...😁
Hey seth, i know its random but do you know of any ways to get cheap used mtb parts localy as my mtb was stolen while locked at my gym.  If you are wondering why i dont just save a bit of money up from worc etc, i cannot do so as im 13 getting £15 a month
I have a 2018 Trance and the same thing happened to my LBS when they were swapping out the bearings. Thankfully Giant covered it under warranty
ACTUALLY you put the rear tire on for better climbing traction. The direction arrows on rear tires and the ramped profile and chevron direction to the center knobs are generally for rolling speed NOT climbing traction.
Breaking parts while trying to fix them is the worst 😭 I tried to fix a bent wheel and snapped a spoke once
👍🏻👍🏻
Recently had mine overhauled by a shop. Thanks for showing me I made the right decision instead of doing it myself! Haha. Normally I do handy things by myself but the tools, the time and the likelihood of breaking something was too high.
Even if the link wasn’t carbon it would be bent. It takes a LOT of force to break undamaged carbon, more than enough to bend aluminum if that size.
apparently Heather thinks ur a bike mechanic
Seth loved this great to see a higher tier brand on the channel loved it even my wife watched it !
That broken linkage shows exactly why I wouldn't use load bearing carbon parts on an MTB even if u PAID me to do so!
10:40 uuuhhh.... that pedal doesn't look threaded in all the way.
Love the oh-so-subtle nod to your bike-hack roots at 1:55. I see you Mr. Seth... well played sir.
My girlfriend had the same Reverb Post, to rectify the situation, we put on the Wolftooth cable actuation swap. Now actuation is smooth and consistent, and no more sag, it's become issueless.
Great vid !
Feel like I just watched a Pimp my bike video
Alloy frame with a carbon fiber rocker link???!
The online bicycle shop
Complain ...no woman complain ever anywhere 😂I'm a woman btw
Me: Wondering why there wasn't a video that week.  Seth: 2 weeks earlier 2:39
Wish I had someone as generous and nice as yourself close to me, being disabled it takes me forever to get the money to keep my bike running.
Yes 🙌🏻 more videos like this if possible. This was so fun and useful to watch.
“occasionally I break things”🤣 We know.
Whats that Bearing removal tool called?
Love the no-nonsense delivery of practical build data. Seth and friends.
My bike has 80mm suspensionfork. Is it possible to upgrade it?
I’m so new to this world that I would have never known that the tire was on backwards 🤣🤣🤣.
I have put both tires on the right way but thought they were backwards, mind you the bike was upside down, so I take them both off rotate, and flip bike right side up, and realize they were right the first time, I am ADHD and Dislexic, so everything looks backwards to me.
Gaint is sadly overlooked and out right dissed in the MTB community, I own an older trance 2 in my stable of bikes.  I had the pleasure of testing out a 2022  29 trance x.  In my opinion it outrides any modern trek, SC, rocky mountain or Kona trail bike.  Fantastic climber and is nice and poppy on the downs for an all mountain trail bike.  The comparables mentioned  are some bikes I got to try out last few years.    Giant has really stepped up there game last 5 years and is making solid bikes for a lot less money compared to other major brands.
Seth's parts bin: thousands of dollars worth of brand new high end components.  My parts bin: dozens of dollars worth of broken components that I hang onto in the event that I am able to salvage good pieces like nuts and springs from.
I'm a huge fan of Giant bicycles; when I first started looking for bikes I was going to go with Specialized but they seemed kind of snobby then I was going to go for Trek but they were overpriced and then I found out that Giant makes Trek bikes and then I went to a giant dealer here in Texas called Bicycle World and the way I was treated as somebody that knew absolutely nothing about modern bicycles at the time sold me on Giant bikes. The man I did business with took the time to listen to my needs as far as where I would be riding how I would be riding and even when I would be riding he then asked how much I could afford not only then but in the future for maintenance once we discussed that he showed me a few options I settled on the giant roam 3 it a a hybrid bike for right at $500 after taxes that was in 2018 I still have the bike it's still going strong and a year later I bought a 2020 model Giant talon 2 xc bike that bike is still going strong and is giving me far more than the $800 I spent on it worth of enjoyment.
These type of videos are really useful! I am getting ready to sell my current/old bike ( and canibalizing some parts out of it) So I want to make sure the next owner does not have to worry about it and can just go on the trail.
Rear tire on backwards just let's us know you're a real human. Work Order would be a good name for the series.
These feel like "SOS Mountain Bike"🚵‍♂ It could be on the Discovery Channel (Do it again now) 🐵
I  think that new rear shock will hit the bottle if its in the cage when the shock compresses, hopefully thats not a issue
Honestly, I really dig the paint job on a lot of these Liv bikes and many women's bikes in general
Heather's hardtail is still my fav bike ever on this channel. Do you know the model on it perhaps? I may have to hunt one down for myself.. Nice job on the Giant btw, my mom is really happy with her Liv as well.
What's the black paint you used? I'm wanting to paint my bike a matte black & that paint looks perfect.
Did Raleigh bikes go out of business or sell out? I don't see them on website anymore, on that note they are having big sales on bikes direct, and bicycles online, on Polygon and Diamondback.
During the change from summer to winter in our shop, in Anchorage Alaska, there are days we swap out dozens of tires to or from studs. There are times I've "carefully" installed (usually tubeless fat tires) tires with their tread backwards more than once on the same wheel. Thanks for yet another great video.
Your hair grows fast
you remove sram x1 and put sram nx  ? :D wtf ...
You and your forsaken channel should be banned, says my wallet and rediscovered love for biking .  Keep the great video's coming :D
Thanks for another great video, what's the dog walking device Heather has bolted to her hardtail.
hi, it's me, your other dog groomer
How did you get Vittoria tires? Ive been looking for mazza and agarro and can't find.
I'm getting scam comments from commenting on your video earlier, so just thought I'd let you know.
"You wanted me to show you how to service a higher end bike". Proceeds to replace everything with new parts
If you put the rear tire on backwards, does it go in reverse when you pedal?
If a shop replaced my rocker arm with a spray painted one I'd flip out. I say this fully aware that you're not a shop and you probably tried your best to find a matching replacement. Still, how is flat black spray paint acceptable? At that point you should have had it professionally painted the factory color with 2k automotive paint and clear coat. I understand you did a full service and installed better parts for free but I would still not be okay with the rattle can paint job. Owner probably didn't even notice though. :D
I intentionally run some tires backward on my fat bike because they provide better traction in snow. So it's not backward, it's in the "extra traction" configuration. ;-)
Can't wait for the epic video on the star nut.
Seth will one day run out of parts to overhaul peoples bikes 🤣
Why did they make an aluminum bike with a carbon link?
I have a giant that’s almost the same bike and I broke the same suspension link😩
Seth shows that the best way to service a RockShox Reverb is to replace it with literally anything else. 👌
Just got a add saying summer is finally hear, boy I wish
Hey seth i have a video idea that also help some people with their mtb questions. I don't know if this idea gonna work but i think it's still pretty cool Buy a budget frame  And build a sub 1000$ bike with all budget parts like when u upgraded your old trek 4900 in like (I'm not sure) 2017. And also i am build my bike and i don't know what budget parts to buy like which dropper post and which air fork. And personally i don't really like the 99$ fork that u bought for a flip bike  So please give some suggestion on good budget parts.
What can I do when I have the same dropper post and it has the same problem and I dont want to get a New one
Love this seth
What bearing press/removal tool is that. I used one I bought from Amazon but it blows…
I bet that getting a hold of that link wasn't easy!
Bro is just simping
I've been mountain biking for years and I just recently started working on bikes, and I just now found out that tires can be put on backwards. Time to go make some adjustments in the garage I guess lol
What’s the bearing press you use ?
That hubs is worth more than everything i own. Yes. Im that kind of poor.
Great work! Love these videos.
I never road a tire on backwards but have put them on backwards. After putting everything together I look closer at the tire and get mad because I put it on backwards. I think everyone has done it.
I wanna see you fix the dropper, the shock and stuff, not just slapping a new one on!
Bike service content is fun, well sure if any local bike shop doin like what seth did on such videography levels, it is gonna be a really temptig content
I don’t even ride mountain bikes yet I’ve been watching Seth for a long time and will continue to do so
Hindi nya rin naman magagamit yan lagi sayang lang.
If Seth is referring to Threadless Headsets by mentioning the star nut's effect on mountain biking, I absolutely agree. Hipsters and retro grouches might still embrace the quill stem/wedge bolt/threaded fork/constantly loose headset, but I hated them with a passion. Aheadset/threadless changed things for the better in mountain, then road and especially in freestyle BMX. Droppers, tubeless, suspension, disc brakes, and 1x/clutch/NW are all important innovations for modern bicycles, but threadless is where bikes really started to not suck.
That shock looks cool but hot take- you don’t need to change minor little things for every ride in any condition. I run my bike with the exact same settings wether I’m doing XC, downhill, street riding. Wether it’s wet, dry, muddy, dusty or in a thunderstorm my bike stays the same
Tire on backwards is the best part of the video😭🤣
Stop buying new bikes and maybe they will start making parts for older great bikes. Also, stop supporting built in obsolescence and buying high dollar bikes to pose at the trail head.  Mountain biking used to be about getting out w bros. not talking about specs and pretentious crap. This is what everybody should do for 5 years and squeeze the bike industry to bring prices of new bikes down and stop pushing pro geos on Avg. Joe's. I live in OH and cannot think of more than a handful of trails where I would say I need a 64 degree headtube angle.
Hey Seth just wanted to come down here and say that this thumbnail was amazing!!
Just in my own opinion, I would love to see you do some 90s style retro mtb overhauls. My kinda jam.
Great video Seth.
the dropper post is actually really easy to repair. rockshox include an air bleed valve right at the top. extend the post all the way, push the valve done. no sag anymore, rock solid, takes 1 minute
Hmmm, would have been interested to see what's wrong with se seatpost or the shock and how to fix it. Just replacing them is easy (if you  have an infinite parts bin, like you)
I'd be pissed that the linkage paint was wrong tbh, he better have ordered a replacement
oops!
Why would Giant put a carbon link on a bike that's made completely out of aluminium?
Okay seriously. What are those Cable clips your using called!? They look so much better than zipties and they are on every build now!
Also had a tire on backwards, but the front one. It really slowed me down on the trail. The wrong installaion can even be seen on my Dreambuild video of my Specialized Enduro. Noticed it a few weeks after uploading🤦🏼‍♂️
you are to nice.
This is a huge undertaking. If you’ve ever broken a bike down and rebuilt it. The video doesn’t do it justice
Is this your dog groomers bike again?  🤣
$$$$$$$
dont tempt fate....put lock tite on the lock tite
Had a survice on my 2018 trance 2 and it needed all new bearings. The bike shop broke the same part as seth. Took 5 months for it to arrive.
You should do some overhaul on someones downhill bike
Impressed how you didn’t use “stretch” when describing chain wear and how it occurs. Kudos
Hope the shock tune is suitable for that bikes linkage. The livs have lighter tunes than the standard  version, plus with that linkage... might need to retune it.
It kinda boggles me how threaded inner fork tubes are so common in bmx, but not so in mtb? or is it just this kind?
I too also have a woman’s giant mountain bike 2008 I think. I haven’t rode it since 2012 after 3 shoulder surgeries and neck also Leary to ride do not want anymore surgeries. Now. I want to start again and watch your videos to overhaul it. I’m 70yo now and time is a wasting. I think what you do for the community and the people in it is so selfless of you. May God bless you and your family and of course Oscar, just love him. Stay safe and keep videos coming
Aww no atleast give Heather a GX drive train anything less is complete garage it dosent even have a clutch.....
I'll be honest, I like mid bike level videos ($600-$2000 range at most). I care nothing for expensive bikes that people take out 6 year loans to own when they could have had a couple of good mid level bikes that differ in styles during that time and give you a taste of all aspects of cycling rather than just extending your small weiner on a 7 grand Santa Cruz.
Love the pedals colour coded to the down tube sticker/paint. Nice touch🤘
You're a good guy! Enjoyed watching, thanks.
I kinda wish my dropper post did that.  lol
Whem the wheel go's on backwards honestly leave it I do lol
Awesome
I wish Liv would sell their bikes in more neutral colors though. Went in to try some and even the less feminine colors like blue were sort of sparkly.
I bet the shock is an apology for f**king your swing arm 🤣 so long as you gave her a loaner bike and fixed the issue that's all that matter. We all make mistakes, As a bike shop owner i've made my share too. And put better parts on a.... *cough* Sorry *cough*
multi tool in the headset is so cool. anybody know if they make em for road bikes? i've seen puncture repair for tubeless tires that goes in your handlebar but never something like this
Seth you should try using some disposable gloves, it really does help a ton.
This one kind of annoyed me. Almost all of the issues are from neglect and or laziness. Laziness in cleaning, laziness in maintenance and general neglect. Regardless of the owners situation it takes no money to keep your bike clean. Most of the issues are from total negligence in cleaning or basic maintenance.
wOW thats a cool hack with this nuts on the brakes so you dont lose the adapter and the oder stuff
Do you have a small ultrasonic parts cleaner for drive train and steel bearings in the workshop? Highly recommend one! Saves a lot of time and elbowgrease.
I know you can get decent bike parts cheaply but remember this without the r and d and all of the other things that go into designing these parts the cheap guys would have nothing to copy!!
My wife got a Liv and it's fits her so much better.  Woman specific geometry is something I wish more brands did
Makes me think I might need a full service on my carbon giant advance trance 2 from 2017, which has never been serviced yet lol. Although mine is in far better condition than this one, but seeing those bearings 🤔🤔.
I actually like more low-mid end bike rebuilds. lol
saw the wheels and said to myself... HAWT DAWM !
That Specialized 2010 P.1 AM is still a super sweet looking bike!
Today Seth does the maintenance someone was too lazy and complacent to get done themselves!  Good on you man. I used to love helping people fix up their stuff, but after seeing them let it go to rags again afterwards too many times I decided that some people NEED to be forced to shell out the big bucks on repairs in order to learn that they should take care of their things
Yummy food for algorithm ;-)
Seth what should I do if my bearings are gone someone said buy  a new for someone said get new bearings  My fork is straight and 1.1/8"
Seth is the "mom" you sugger mommy ?   (Just joking )
Great video. Who makes the bearing press and headset press you used?
is it just me or has seth been rockin the cane creek  stuff a lot lately?
I cringed so hard when I see you working on bikes. a simple call to your LBS would have saved you from breaking stuff.
Really enjoyed this one!
This was cool. Thanks for sharing this with us. Heather is lucky to have a friend like you.
Basically a brand new bike! Great!
You should make a new channel called flip bike
Wish i was his neighbor 😂
I've decided some tires spontaneously change direction while be mounted. It's the only explanation. The only explanation.
Great video 👌
Good guy Seth 😊👍
I hope this mom's bike is your wife's bike. It definitely needed some TLC
Man, I should give you my bike 😂
Love these types of videos keep them coming!
guys  service your forks
If I were to ever trust anyone to break my bike it would be Seth 😂😂
I hope u thread that driveside pedal the rest of the way in lol (@ 10:42)
I have a very similar link on my Salsa, and I bent it overhauling the bike. It was a cast magnesium part, and the real fun came when I found out Salsa doesn’t sell it. They did send me one salvaged off another warrantied frame, though, for free.
I had to get my daughter that's 13 a LIV.  She's on the short side and they make the lowest stand-over 27.5" wheel bike that I could find.  She started racing last year so I wanted to get her an upgrade from her 26" LIV Hardtail (Again bought because at the time it was the only thing she had stand-over on).
Classic story. You work on your buddies bike, break something, then do some free upgrades :)
Ahh the old back wards rear tire. If I did that I wouldn't bother removing it and putting it the correct way.
Hang on a minute, did I just see you use valve stem nuts to retain the bolts on those calipers?? That's a sneaky brilliant hack right there. Saving that one!
I am not joking ,if i will ever buy a expensive bike with shocks on air\oil instead of the indestructible coil i will put a condom on the gliding side so they will last longer. Buying expensive rochshox/fox shocks and not having dust/water protection on the gliding side it's like throwing away your money. Shame on these companies for making incomplete products/shocks that need that much attention every couple of months.
You should start doing more traveling videos like to whistler/ the north shore or like Sedona or smt
Nooo not the rear tire lol. I hate it when that happens
Seth, do you need another dog groomer by chance?
Hello seth! I have recently bought a 2018 giant reign in literally mint condition and i wanted to ask you how reliable it is and what are some common things about it that i sould specifically take care of. I have bought new shimano xt brakes and sram gx shifter. That is actually my first fully (i have ridden a lot of xc on several hardtails) so i wanted to ask you a few stuff. Much love
you know you've got your content creation process dialed when an unexpected replacement part delay is just a blip in the magic of editing for viewers haha
This may be a tiny bit weird, but I'm running this same bike! Luckily it's teal so not super feminine, but virtually the same as a Giant Reign. Great bike!
May I ask where you got the bearing tools for the linkage ?
If they had brought back pimp my ride but they had a different version called pimp my bike, I feel like Seth would've stared perfectly in it with the amount of detail he goes into flipping and upgrading the bike at the same time👍
Today I learned: that I can use the "useless" inner tube nut/ring thingy to hold the caliper's screws in place when disassembled. Nice that one!
this bearing tool looks awesome - from which manufacturer is that? i think i need a tool like that :)
How do I get a parts bin upgrade? I have a Kent Trouvaille. It has a dropper seat post pretty much it for upgrades it's going to have a right hydraulic rear brake pretty soon. I'm a father of six with three still living at home with me going to school. My son and I like to hit the trails as much as possible. I hit the trails at least three times a week. But I ride my bike every day.
more bike hacks
Oh to have seths parts bin 😅
I love your content Seth, please continue, and a Salve from Brazil
The backwards rear tire is always a classic, and using tubeless makes it even more fun. This is coming from a guy that rode his MTB with the rear tire on backwards for over a year.
In the motorcycle world (off-road), they use the term, "pink it and shrink it."  That's when they reduce the size of riding gear and, literally, make it pink and call it "for women."  Most women hate this.
I'm so glad the last tire I put on backwards still had a tube in it. Never happened to me again (knocking on wood) since I transitioned to tubeless 4 years ago.
OneUp suggests having 10mm spacers above the stem for the installation of the threaded top cap. This is to prevent clamping forces from the stem onto the threaded section of the steerer tube.   I also didn’t follow their advice and only went with 5mm spacers above the stem for the cool factor.   You are ballsy to go with no spacers above the stem. It definitely looks cleaner. But you are clamping about 8Nm onto the threaded section of the steer tube which is has less material to clamp onto.
I think I have tire dyslexia, I have put tires on backwards like 6 times, even after double and triple checking orientation. I think my brain is broken.
That flat black linkage looks like crap and sticks out like a sore thumb. You should have taken more time with that and fixed your mistake much better than that. Sloppy work
Great episode I'd love to see another higher end bike rescue!
I love these videos, and I appreciate you taking the time to give us such good content. :)
12:48 Ah yes. Directional tires. No matter how many times you do it right, you're gonna do it wrong one day.. xd
Wow, what a bike for a mom to ride, great video
you went so overkill with these i9 hubs! love it!!!
Always a good day when Seth posts
Would be interesting to see a mountain biker try motocross 🤔🤔
That bike is just glorious !! 🙌 and we have all put the tyre on backwards at least once !
Awesome video as usual 🤩👍
That loook identical to my giant stance 2
Cool bike me want 😈
Seth l have been watching you a lot lately I'm wondering if you have any spare parts for my mountain bike please
BEST PART OF THE DAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Oh yeah... I've heard this story many times. I've done many full tunes and cleanouts for free, simply because the bike was so sick and circling the drain.
Love the flip bike series keep ‘em going Seth
Hi That was amazing video you are lucky for having a godd shop and place to ride
