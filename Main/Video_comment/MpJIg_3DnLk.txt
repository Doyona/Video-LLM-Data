Back here in 2025 and still gettting choked up watching this.

The best ever ❤

Best fireworks display in history.
Ringing right today night. 2025 is here.
I love how this has 11M views, despite clearly being the 2nd-worst NYE show of all time
2:28 The New Virus For Sure. 2:14
I genuinely watched this once very quickly at the time i thought it was the worst display looking back at it on the last day of 2024 it brought tears to my eyes and this is one of the best, by far london is the best in the world at planning new year fireworks and putting it all in sync with each other and the music

Thank you Mr Sadiq Khan this was fabulous. Spectacular display yet no debris nor nuisance big bangs which are upsetting to pets, animals, wildlife and some humans. Some have even died from stress. This should be the norm and the way forward 👏 ❤

People in2024🎉
This was god damn amazing, I was in tears that year considering the passing on my great nana and grandad and for somehow living through the 2020 hell. The world has gone to mess now I wish we could go back to being a community and working together.
this has always been one of my favorites new years celebrations
Let's get everything straight . Not nice hearing police sirens going off there at the end of that great memory. I hope we all know that that's not natural. Let's all at least acknowledge it.
Happy New year everyone
Tell me why I always cry when watching this in 2024
Am I the only one who realised they copied Sydney Australia,here’s how No 1.they have the waterfall from the bridge (like Sydney) No 2.they have fireworks coming off the bridge(like Sydney) Nice firework show tho! Keep it up,London!❤

Can't believe 2021 is 3 years ago and the tower brige is copying the sydney's fireworks at the ending❤
Since 2020 the displays are awful. Waste of tax payers money. And people pay money to see this  💩
I look back at this in 2024, i dont think i realised at the time that this is an absolute masterpiece compared to the others, beautiful..
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅

The Nightingale was breathtaking! The way the drones were condonated to move the wings was just awe inspiring seeing it in 2024 still gives me chills up my spine

Who is watching this in 2024
The best fireworks in many years as this year I have no enjoy 😢
Im really glad I have to pay a fortune in road tax for my car that gets me to work. This tax will stop my emissions destroying the environment.😮

Hey. This Spyro 2 Song!!!

I will never forget how much this meant to me at the time, appreciating this display of love from America
bro I need time to live 2021 was 3 years ago 😭😭
It 2024 and I still keep watching this every new year eve because of how good this is, well done to the team who put work into this because this display is still my favorite
Can't believe this was 3 years ago now. Still feels as good as it did back then. Here's to 2024. Happy New Year!!
Officially 2024 and this is still my favourite
3 years...
Miss 2021! These fireworks were so emotional too. Especially after a year of losing so many people during Covid.
3 years ago of 2021
Unfortunately NHS heroes were forgotten! Sadly but I see on my skin!
LONG LIVE 2021 ❤
Is that Spyro 2 hub world music backing Auld Lang Syne at 9:01 I hear?
Am I the only one hearing Autumn Plains from Spyro 2 at 9:01? 🤣I hope you gave my purple boi some royalties 💜
2026 1 Jan
Here is how to get saved and be right with God for eternal life, if anyone is curious to look into it for themselves. ;)  1-Realize that all have sinned before God, in one way or another, so everyone of us is a sinner in the sight of God.  Romans 3: 10+23 (KJB)  10. "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”   2-Realize that God still loved us, even as wicked sinners in his sight.  Even enough to allow his only begotten Son Jesus Christ to pay the full price for our sins.  All by living a sinless life in our place and by shedding his own precious blood on the cross, to fully pay the price for the sins we all have done, as a freely given gift to us sinners.   Romans 5: 8-9 (KJB)  8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."  9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."   Romans 6: 23 (KJB)  “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”   3-Than to be saved, you just need to confess unto God (inwardly or outwardly) genuinely and ask for your sins to be forgiven.  All by accepting this freely given gift of forgiveness out of God's love for us, that Jesus Christ shed his blood on the cross to pay the full price for all of your sins (that is it).  Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB)  9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”  10."For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."  13."For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.”   Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB)  27."And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"  28."So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”   Revelation 21: 8 (KJB)  "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”   Lastly here is an example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins if you are having trouble finding the exact words to pray to God. Although it is the genuine intent towards God that matters , more than the exact words said. :)   “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.  I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me.  I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.  I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. I trust in him alone to save me. Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus.  I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”
Wow, el lunes que viene es año nuevo y este video cumplira 3 años.
I was a frontline and I remember everyone going out their houses every Thursday.. I haven’t watched this video until now. Wow. So many memories… I was so overwhelmed but happy that we pushed through!
I did not liked this show. Watched it back, still dont like it. (Better then 2022 dont even want to watch that one)
Eu sou brasileiro, sei que a British Broadcast Company me entende na minha língua... E em 09/12/2023 eu queria que o povo brasileiro tivesse nessa época o carinho e respeito pelo SUS como o Reino Unido teve pelo NHS... Eu me lembro que na virada desse ano eu tava trabalhando (sou porteiro) e fiquei sozinho na guarita chorando feito uma criança vendo a transmissão de vocês... Até pq aqui no Brasil são 6h a mais que aí... E eu ainda tenho o sonho de passa o réveillon aí em London

Elizabeth 2 plotted all your WARs in USA and Europe, from Singapore, her family is tied to frauding and theft with escorts impersonating videos or photos with the Singapore Police in house break INS, drugs, prostitute trafficking and robberies since early 90s when they did it with Diana and Fann WONG, your WARs are done by Mr WONG kan Seng, NG Joo Hee, Melvin YONG Yik Chye, TAN Chuan Jin, Tharman, Vivian Bala, K Shanm, Halimah YACOB Masagos Zukifli, with her indian in the UK, they plotted your WARs by harassing for money and CCTVS with Fann WONG, Jeanette AW, Kate Middleton and Megan Markle. Funding Obamas presidency and the wars for two whole terms. They are all tied to house break INS and theft in Asia with Malays indians tied to Halimah YACOB, Masagos Zukifli whereby they swindle cash and steal multiples to themselves. Elizabeth 2 is the one that embezzled cash repeatedly and stole multiple times to cover up for herself, whether it was Diana or the wars they plotted with Obama. With Fann WONG, Jeanette AW tied to Bank FRAUDs. It's done by WONG kan Seng, NG Joo Hee, NG Eng Hen with Fann WONG they do it with their extended family members same with TAN Chuan Jin, CalCarries Jane Leong, Angelyn Li, Wayne Li, LIN-YIH, POH Hock Guan, with Li Hsien Loong, they are all tied to a network of organized criminal activities to fund their expenses and these wars they plotted during WW2 and present cause they are after land and money. The whole entire Clementi Head quarters with Melvin YONG Yik Chye are the ones behind all your WARs they are all hired by Li Hsien Loong. He bribes all of them with swindled cash, stolen items, Elizabeth 2 did the same thing with Kate Middleton and Megan Markle, with her indian, Halimah YACOB, Masagos Zukifli, they looted out your own TAX to fund your own wars, repeated it again during the pandemic
It is kinda approaching 2024 and i still watch this. Edit: Are you tellin me they did these brilliant firework displays in 2021 and 2022 just cause of the pandemic in 2020?

Who also comes back to these new year vids on New Years Day?
Its 2023 btw
3:40 was the best
i remember watching this as a 13 year old and being oddly overwhelmed. 2020 was the first year i actually struggled with my mental health, and the reflective yearly recap mixed with the joy that it was over was so much for me i remember crying the second i got back to my room. and here i am, crying again. i can’t believe it’s only been 2 years, it feels like nothing and everything at the same time, but i’m now 15 and i love new year more than christmas. i party hard now, with people who i didn’t even know this time 2 years ago.   but coming back here 2 years on is so mad, the way things got worse and so much better at the same time, it’s still overwhelming. captain tom died, corona virus is practically gone. i can’t wait for what 2023 is going to bring. 🤍
watching this while its the first of 2023
Great to see HRH Queen Elizabeth's Memory in there! VIVA BRITAIN!!!!! ❤❤❤❤Happy New Year!!!!
2023: ready to head into the unknown 2022: nope.   Let’s do it 2021: I hope we will se you again

Here comes the New Year again How lucky my generation is! We grew up listening to such great music! And although the reel-to-reel tape recorder was the ultimate dream, ABBA, the Beatles remained forever in our souls! There, every song is a hit!
This will soon be 2 years ago...
Who is here in 2023 👇
It’s been a year already!! 🫠  Edit : who’s up for 2023? Counting down 3 days 🎉
Watching back on December 28th 2022 Can't wait for the fireworks to come
This is so amazing
it’s been two years wtf 😳
i Can't Belive Time Went So Fast. I Feel Like It's Only 5 Months Not Even Years. And This Videos Is 1 Years Ago.
What’s hilarious is that people really thought the world would go back to normal lmao
Some stuff is installed in London Eye for the fireworks, look like NYE 2020, with extra fireworks in London eye
what a load of bull  i hate i spent time looking at this shit
I have 2 tickets to the blue zone this year. Can't go-want to sell them.
NEARLY 2023🎉🎉
Amazing now 2022  the N 2023 fireworks 🎇🎆
We never knew what a horrible nasty year 2022 would be. If only time could have just stopped and 2022 had never happened.
0:47 the countdown begins!
Hello, I am flying to London for the first time over the New Years and I have a few questions. 🙂 Does anyone know? There are some colored tickets where you can watch the fireworks. What's the best place?
Never again dont do like this..
AND THERE GOES SPONGEBOBS VOICE!😭
ITS JUST AWESOME What a beautiful fireworks show
Apart from the BLM bollocks which is Marxist front of thuggery, the rest of the show was spectacular
Chúc mừng sinh nhất
Amazing.
Shame we’re still doing nothing to honour David’s words. And I’m sure the NHS appreciate the millions spent on fireworks to honour them rather than going towards their pay packages. Loved the fireworks, but it’s all just wishy washy ticky boxey.
Icl that year sucked
It will consume
That’s exactly what I thought
Wasn’t anyone else thinking this is gonna be the worst fireworks display I’ve ever seen at the beginning when Big Ben struck midnight
Fireworks are EXTREMELY scary !
i love fireworks
It go now is 2022
these are bombs >:(
In 2 months 2020 would’ve been 3 years ago…seems like yesterday
I miss 2021!!! I want to go back to that year!

This was PERFECT until you had to mention, black, ethic, black lives matter etc - ALL LIVES MATTER, DOESNT MATTER WHAT COLOR YOUR SKIN IS... We are ALL HUMAN, ALL EQUAL! ALL HAVE FEELINGS, MOMS, DADS, BROTHERS & SISTERS....  Should turn this on the BBC for actually mentioning stuff like this like as if they are "Different" - Like I said we are ALL HUMAN!

Popping streamers🎉 and champagne🥂 at the turn of the new Gregorian year is a long endured tradition in Western countries that even Covid cannot stop it completely. These videos provide some great sychronized music and at atmosphere full of hope and optimism for the future.

The worlds greatest always puts on a stunning show 🇬🇧
I like the part when it said 2021 in the air
What a waste of public funds
Please upload a 1080P version of 2021 firework,thank U,happy new Yr!
looking back on this it's heartbreaking to see that london did something for black lives matter in mentioned it but yet  the united states did not do nothing or mention It. IT Happened Here said to see that these other countries care more about us minorities then hre in the US  than our own government. TY LONDON
sitting here from sydney watching this in 2022 and in literal tears. incredible
hi from 1 year later
Best new year fireworks going, far better than the 2022 rubbish
4:27 Drone Captain Tom was the best part
The fact that the UK is so open to others is amazing. Incorporating BLM and talking about their healthcare workers and our crumbling planet is awesome. Living in America is not the dream and America is not ahead of the game like it proclaims to be!
Lies lies lies 🤔🤔🙄🤪
💪🏻🎆🎇🌃🎆🎇🎇🎉🎉🎉🎉
Started so slow I turned off
This didn’t happen wake up!!!!
Happy new year guys
Nice to see the Peaceful use of Drones. ✌🏼
'Your on mute' ! ;-)
Happy new year🎉🎆 2wwwwwww2wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooooooo
Nice video once you turn off audio and can't hear the dribble the announcer is spewing.
The clock did not ring that is faked , the fireworks did not look anything like that in real life that too must have been faked
Didn’t look that good in real life🤔 strange that
I miss 2021 :(
Okay.
Happy 2022
Funny in the end they talk about save the planet with all these fireworks Lol!
It now 2022 this is year old now
they put florence and the machine
WOW amazing put a lump in my throat god bless everyone out there " ONE LOVE" X
1 year ago    I already feel old
Amazing that the BBC didn't promote this, what a surprise. Lying to the British public as usual.
Best display London has ever put on and in such difficult circumstances. Still get emotional watchin it again. Big thumbs up to the team. Beat that world
Feliz año nuevo 2022
Loved St Paul’s and our wonderful city looking so spectacular
1 year ago today :)
Arguably the first video of 2021 which is 1 year old. The nostalgia 😲
What an embarrassment
I can’t believe what I’m hearing. Not one person has been treated at any Nightingale Hospital.
This will be forever my favourite one still emotional 😭
Should of put this on instead of the nonsense we saw
Didn't happen... Tens of thousands of people on street seen or heard nothing!! BBC liars.
This was so much better then this years
this is cute!
All Together - Join Together - Hope Together - Love Together.
Bye 2021 ✨ HELLO 2022 ✨🥳
This one is definitely better than 2022! Dubai wins this year by far.
This forever will be the best one. Was so disappointed with this years. Not the same.
Should of put khan and Boris on the top and bingo
Utter rubbish where was the fireworks. We don’t want lazors. And again all because of the woke bbc. Defund this channel asap
There is proof in many videos posted that Big Ben did not chime....fakery is alive and well.
anyone here after realising how shocking the 2022 ones were
All CGI. All fake. The nerve of them doing this. I was there last night. There was NOTHING like this happening. One needs to question all the other cities in the world. How much of theirs is CGI
Happy new year to you all in the UK but we remember on the time the all who pass away with cov 19 we go to 2022 we will not forget you all your name will with us all so in 2022 home and hosptil and all us we will remb you all
England is now a third world toilet 🚽
Wow how wonderful was that
Happy Easter everybody
im only here because this one was better than we had today 😂
I was really disappointed with the fireworks 2022 display. I think it's hard to compete with this masterpiece tho!
Shut up BBC
Who else thought this one was better then 2022?
The NWO having its own party 😂😂
Humankind is like the rainbow, all colours, all lives matter, in each moment we celebrate as progress.
This one had more heart than this years.
I thought the firework display had been cancelled
20222222
I thought this was cancelled last year.... ermmmm 🤔
From Philippines 🇵🇭 Happy New year!
I was there last night at London Eye but this is not what I saw. No fireworks
I came to watch fireworks, I left with a politically charged message about Covid, BLM, the Environment and the NHS. It's not that deep man, just put fireworks on.
That was sick ngl
More BBC propaganda with light's & fireworks... Don't forget that those Nightingale hospitals weren't fit for purpose and all the lies the BBC told you throughout the last 2 year's. Also where is the money that Captain Tom raised? As for supporting a Marxist terrorist group BLM and all these WOKE agenda just  stop paying for the BBC in 2022 👍
Enough with the fing virus.
I'm not going to lie. Comparing this one with the one from 2022, this one is miles better. Happy New Year everyone!
There 2022 new year fireworks were the best
Hi from 2022
Watching this on 2022 nye. London nye displays are my favourite
Impressive !
Had to mention the BAMES didn't they
Legends are in 2022
Happy  New Year🎆🎇✨🧨🎉🎊
Watching this in 2022, Its cool.
This feels like WrestleMania
The BBC has a clear mandate to be politically neutral at ALL times. Ahahahaha I guess we just sit on the sofa and let them bombard us with whatever they want ..if it is shinny and goes bang middle class lefties love out.... ! Politics is for the News so I know when to avoid watching it The left is for the working class who really do struggle... ! All the Champagne Socialists thinking "Its really rather marvellous what these chaps can do with displays these days "How rich and wonderful they. Making the world a diverse place and keeping their dosh at the same time !!!  ahahahaha.
So much better than this years
জনপ্রিয় বাংলা চ্যেনেল
Happy new year even for a blinds sheeps 🐑
Good display...could be done without the commentary
damn this was one year ago felt like yesterday happy new year guys ♥️🎉🥳
Now it's 2022 hope they do something like this again:)
Happy new year Am happy
Happy new year
Wow this video is 1 year ago
What a let down  Again
I'm glad that year is finally out of the window
Who's watching this on New Year's Eve almost hitting 2021 like this comment
Lost me with the coronavirus crap it’s been a rough year why bring it up
Have a Blessed New Year!!!
No not every simple act of kindness was given its due , people with physical and mental heath problems are still being dragged through DWP procedures. People who suffer from mental health problems are still being made to cope with assessments that last for up to an hour and a half ! I know I am one of them! The drones and fireworks are all very pretty but how many disabled people could have been allowed PIP without going through 12 months off uncertainty until they had ( most embarrassing and upsetting off all)  to go to a magistrates court to have their tribunals  for what that costs???  Do they have any idea how degrading that is ?????  PIP doesn't just give people the money  they need to live it also gives them the housing they need as most social housing is dependant on that person being in receipt off PIP .
Happy new year’s LONDON
1:00 Big Ben looks so beautiful now, came back to watch these ones instead of the 2022 firework display because that was disappointing
This was much better than the 2022 display.
NDL! :》
...and✨🎶STORMZY!!✨
🇬🇧___✨🌍 💨  ✌🏻
Who else is watching this after the 2022 new year's
What a load of rubbish. Still perpetrating the lies and false narrative. Conning the people
Exactly one year ago today (On January the 1st) was when my family tested positive for coronavirus. The after affects of the virus lead to a massive change in my family dynamic which affected us for the majority of the year. Only now in the past two months have we returned somewhat to our old selves.   But my family wasn’t the only that changed for me in 2021. Now that I’m growing up, my life is also changing fast. I’m starting to enter a new phase of my life. One that I’m not prepared for at all and a change I dread. In 2022, I worry very much about my future. It is filled with uncertainty but at the same time,  there is also that one tiny speck of hope.
Still the best display and such a heartfelt message. Love you all and HNY!❤️
That's funny, big Ben never chimed in real life. What's going on BBC? What else are you doing to manipulate people? 🤔
The same carers  who were fired for not getting jabbed  unbelievable! !!! I work in health and social care and I am White English  we were front line too
2021 was fast... 2022 here we go..
Can't believe they used the virus ha I thought we had no money eh more up in smoke.
This is amazing 🤩 Happy New Year from Australia 💗🤗
Who's watching this right after 2022 live event
Fahim
HAPPY NEW YEAR
Good ol' big ben ringing in the new year!! Happy new year and God save the queen! 🇬🇧🇬🇧

HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL THE FRONTLINER AND ALSO FOR THE NHS
About 25 minutes after 2022 and watching this over I start missing 2021😭😭

Much better then this year's London fireworks
It's fantastic

God, Big Ben made me feel like y'all were about to ring in "Hell's Bells"
Its 2022 in 5 minutes
New yearrrŕ
Fk the BBC
Who’s here almost a year later
You mean you all enslaved us for 500 years and all we get is a firework show?  Lol jk BLM is probably rolling their eyes so its funny
Just 1 more hour until 2022 rings in 😳
Omg lol BLM ha ha ha lolololol
I cried with the black lives matter sign....it feels good to finally feel that we made a difference! The whole show and the message was amazing!!
I think coronavirus is a scam and even i think they did a great job with this
Good job to everyone.  That is awesome!  Are those dronrs doing the lights of the birds?
all you need is hospital records and fireworks and im there.
Lol awesome.  The warning had me hooked.  You mean i can damage myself watching? Cool!
here 1 hour before 2022
Not with family but in bed on own watching live hi guys
Why do we in Cologne, Germany, are not allowed fireworks? Compare with London!!!
Why was this so emotional for some reason
the BLM  logo ... lol , thats how bad its got
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2022, UK!!!! I wish the people of Cornwall to remain strong and get their grammar schools + good well performing middle size secondary schools back to correct the mistakes of belligerent oligarchs in politics making behind the public back profit from ongoing wars so every wrongly closed school needs to take it to HIGH COURT if iffy smear Ofsted reports were given in  damming under 10 pages sloppily. My GIFT to CORNWALL!!!!! LOVE'n PEACE for a HAPPIER SUCCESSFUL 2022!!!! I hope so clever reads this + makes it locally safely viral, bestly anonymous.💗💗💗💗💗🕵🕵🕵🕵🕵 As war crimes to their own people have no statutory limits, belligerent governments invested in warfare does not want an intelligent academical public who speak out + expose their wrongdoings.

Thanks to all NHS staff in 2021 for what you have done to help the UK!
Who is here on December 31st 2021? Only 2 hours and 30 minutes until New Year’s! 🎉 🥳
PLEASE TO ALL  vaccinated, unvaccinated  young ones and children Very Best Wishes for a Happy New Year 2022 is to use amla oil regularly on hands, forearms and face when going out and washing often with w and s, and the sars cov2 becomes dumb in this oily medium and is very less likely to penetrate our body; please do not forget other safety measures. God bless. ✌💘.
This is not good year this is better year
Wow

Well.. I am probably the only one who dont like it.. I prefer the older types of fireworks from London.. I dont like laser shows and drons.
I know this was last year but still it's exciting
Happy new year

Jk
Watching this in December 31st 2021 feels like 31 st December 2020 to me
Earth: Goes around the Sun once  Humans:
Cant wait
I live in Australia and I live in the bush so there’s no fireworks
happy new year 2022
Really gave me the chills watching this today
Best 🎆
Oh boy! This one hit all the feels! NO other UK ceremony really had that effect its always been bland boring and repeatative. But the use of more locations such as Wembley and the o2, Tower Bridge, The light show and the stories told reflects back on a highly emotionally charged year with the sacrifice we all had to make and adapt to.  How could you not tear up to this? This was beautiful and bittersweet at the same time,  Hopefully this will be done again one day with crowds out to enjoy in person In much happier times!
This is very good 🎆 And beautiful! 💕 and rip Captain Tom Moore 😢
Without big ben, it won't be felt as it was a british new year.
Wow this is amazing!
I feel sorry for those people who had to work their assess off for the entertainment of everyone. They should have been with their families during that time. But no, they had to set up that fireworks display.
Here we are again people. Wishing you a happier 2022, may your year be filled with love and happiness 💖💖
P
Happy New Year London its New Years eve here in New Zealand

Happy new year not now it’s just December but still
Fireworks are dangerous to the environment because they contain carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitroxide. Which are 3 gas that can harm environment
I can’t wait till the end of 2021 i never want to see or think of this year ever again I despised this year
god bless u
That was 2020 fireworks display
Are they doing fireworks this year??
2022 👍💪
Bruh its feels like yesterday
I can't wait to see what 2022 display will look like
Who still remember this
2021 1 january I have covid19. I cry in hospital. my dad passed away in hospital too. that's my bad story about 2021.
Nearly 2022 and this still gives me goosebumps. Hope they do the same next week ❤️

Why did this go ahead last year when supposedly the situation was much worse than it is this year?? The fireworks display for 2022 should not have been cancelled! Such a shame
Let's all have a moment for students from Jan 2021 to Mar 2021 who use to think Microsoft Teams were better than going to skl and during those times, they playing warzone 😅😅
Should we expect more of this in 2022? @BBC
Honestly, let's not forget. Let's save ourselves, that's both humans from the pandemic and the rest of life on earth from what us humans have done
Love
😍😍👍♥️😇😱
Well now its almost 2022 :)
Almost 2022 thank gosh this year was far too tough for me I hope next year will be better 🥺🥺😭😭🤞🤞
HAPPY 😊😊😊
London NYE 2022 fireworks are officially canceled again, let's see if gov is planning for something similar again this time
I was with my aunt when this display happened who lives behind Wembley stadium. We weren't warned of the fireworks at the stadium and nearly pissed ourselves when they started going off 😂😂
Here waiting for 2022. Goodbye our beloved 2021 and RIP Prince Philip ❤️❤️
I am getting so emotional everytime I watch this. I hope that one day I am going to see the London Firework on Sylvester live in the City. And even if it takes years.  One day...  I am not British correct mistakes please.
The. Second coming Jesus Christ 12 am enjoy Christmas last life
The last December 2022
I can't wait for this year's new year Eve lockdown
I cried and II will watch it every day But I am lying I didn't cry but it was beautiful But the sing that I was Sing in my mind is  It dead
i’m so happy to be british and look back at what the nhs had done for us and the fact we celebrate like this is amaozng
Excellent👍
Hope they do it this year. With thousands of people there.

😊happy 😊☺💖💕💓 new years off us ALL us have a goodnight 😴😘💗✨
I’m back here 12 months later 2021 December
Thanks for this educative video and also thanks to those who recommended Rosie for her good works. Y'all have to know that making money digitally is the main key to survival now, as the government is hesitant on helping poor masses. I also recommend Rosie to people who wishes to earn hu ge proflt.

How London has changed. I visited London in 2010 and the level of immigrants was horrendous then. Only the big issue seller was white! I went now in 2021 and every one in non white. Black Asian, Arab ! SO it goodnight London. You have sold yourself, JUst like the adverts and TV shows have to have a Black person, an Asian women, Note not the Asian or WHite Male! Maybe Karama has come to haunt England! No wonder the Dept gate is full of white people with  aa ticket to Oz, NZ, Canada, USA and the arrival gate is full of coloured people with a one way ticket and first words are I calim Asylu, and next No English!
Why did this year go fast?
20 days~    i'M cOmInG fOr YoU 2022!

WOW I went to London in November 17th
Was there people there?
And then there's Germany with not one firework, only a few leftovers from the year before. Luckily I can enjoy the London fireworks that never disappoint
I absolutely love it when they at least turn on Big Ben despite repairs to ring in the new year
Uae is better
It is almost time just another 30 days

What time did this happen? I know it happened on December 31 this year but what time was it?
Why did They said that year will bring hope well first captain Tom sadly died same as Prince Philip
November 2021: Still dealing with Covid 😒
January 1, 2021
Watching this as Christmas is knocking the door.
Would love to have seen how this looked from the street, I guess the sound was only on the TV, so was just drones making images in the sky?
I did i was crying of happy
R.I.P CAPTIAN TOM 🥺🥺🥺
Let’s be real. This year wasn’t so bad compared to 2020
I'm so happy I most it
Song is dance
J3j3 n
Another load of old crap we the people have had to pay for, to be told only black lives matter this country is a joke , this is insulting the people , it's crap, stick to telling lies , what MSM and Doris are very good at doing.
What a depressing load of old rubbish we can't even enjoy the fireworks without you mentioning the pandemic , it's soul destroying living in this country, I'm going to watch the Japanese fireworks , they do it properly , this lot here make you want to hang yourself it's so depressing , and how can you put the NHS letters in a heart when your sacking them all . This is the worse show in the world we are pathetic .
I wish roblox broookhaven do this rhis would be amzing
Happy now year 😌😭🥰
HAPPY BONFIRE NIGHT
Did anyone notice the fireworks?
I love how you tell me are you gay please
Still I can hear big ben chimes
God I really hate that stupid a virus cane our way speech. Stick some Rock music on Not listen to crap speech like that. Urghh 😒

Bhosdiwalon ab Deepawali mein gyaan mat chodna....
I love 2021
Omgg
2021 was a BORING year, nothing that good happened
I think they should ban fireworks. Wretched things. Noisy. Loud. Destructive and polluting.
this program contians flashing images 0:00
It’s now October, I miss 2000+ :’)
WTF.
The fireworks are beautiful
Wow
Sorry but this is depressing! Why did they need to make it about the NHS because it has not been going well for NHS workers in 2021, in 2021 we are the villains and losing our jobs!
I remember that day was so cold I'm surprised the fireworks didn't freeze
Love it. From Vietnam
January 1, 2021
I've noticed NO ONE is talking about Sir David Attenborough's climate change message at the end. Do any of you even care?
!!!hsgmzfzhz😀😀🎆jdgz 2021 Sgfsfshsgsfsf👍👍👍👍
Background song name? !?
I hate 2021
IT WAS SO NICE        BUT THAT RUGTAG MUSIC  on the background which is a monkey culture type is make it cheap.   SO I HAD TO MUTE IT FOR TO GET OUT THE TOGETHERNESS OF LOVE AND RICHLY DISTROBUTION OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THIS INCREDIBLE FIRE WORK.
happy new year 2022
I'm still watching this in october
It's so emotional 😥but I'm glad 2020 is gone it was stressful with homeschool
😉😊😁😄😃😀🙂😇😆🙃
ALSO I CHURCHMAN HOMECOMING
is in london?
Bri ish new year
Thank you NHS ❤️❤️
this is by far the best new years they've done and I'm born on the 1st so its like a celebration of my birthday every year
I know it's too early to judge but so far  2021 was a bit underwhelming. I mean USA got rid of Trump, so that's a good thing but the virus and COPPA show no signs of slowing down. Oh well let's see what the remaining 1.5 months have in store for us.
Thx for us to and not just yor side of Earth
In all 50 states
Come to amirca and do this plz
Go london
Being a free contry i like this im only 9
Good god king and qween
We even help afirca
Im in us and im wach7ng this and i go wow
Wow
In Optober
Happt new year london from the us
This was perfect until we decided on the black lives matter bit... I mean... what about Chinese, what about Pakistani lives... This really was not needed. We should be seen as one, which we are, we are all human.

It's about to be 2022 wow 😲
Oct 2021 ppl?
I thought there were NO fireworks in London on NYE??
Anybody catch the symbolism? Was pretty blatant, if you know even a little about the occult, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, and the 13 bloodlines that control us from the shadows they dwell in.
It's happy
Heard that they’ve cancelled the London Fireworks for 2022. I just want it to be normal again🤦‍♂️
2022 coming soon 82 days left until 2022 starts!
FIREFIGHTERS
Omg I'm in that video  it was hell fun when  I went there
Only thing that spoiled it was showing BLM
thats very cool❤
Why am i watching this in 0ctober 7th 2021?😆😆😆
Does anyone know the song at the end of this video reminds me of a old song but forgot the name
Cannot Wait For This In 2022!
It's 2021 woo hoo

Why are the comments so small
The capital Tom part got to me😢💙
2021...the year when England lost everything against Italy😂
Happy new year
David is a god when it comes to speeches.
The music choices are so good.
The fireworks are showing a sad emoticon.
I am actually crying...SO beautifull.
Drones should never be replacing fireworks. But combining these 2 is pure genius.
2021 a year of hope, 7 months of restrictions. Vaccines been rolled out, we are beating this virus it is the year of hope we're getting back too normality. Rip too all those who lost there lives too covid-19 and everything else😥  💪❤
Looks like world war 3
O.o
legend London)

People in New Year's Day: "Yaaayyy!!! Let's celebrate."   Dogs who hate Fireworks: "My Dissapointment is Immeasurable and My Day is Ruined."
Honestly still look back and cry I am so proud of everyone for sticking together and staying strong and sending love to those who unfortunately didn’t make it 💙
Beautiful 💖💖 💖💖💖💖 and wow

The UK definitely did the best with this. They really included covid, the NHS, Captain Tom, online lessons and BLM all in one fireworks show. Outstanding. 8 months later and still get emotional over it.
yashiro: Feliz Cumpleaños
Great show but are you not helping towards the planet when you let off all those fireworks which is what you ended on?
Would you care to share who is the music director/mixer for this wonderful video. This is top notch.
"Mission accomplished you have finally completed the game 2020 and you survived in 2020, now you can enter 2021"  Covid-19: *I didn't say my last words*

I’m wondering if they’re going to start doing this in addition to the fireworks at the London Eye. Just have fireworks going off from all over the London River like in 2000

RIP Captain Tom😭😭
I got shivers 😭
me ,me
This makes me really sad despite the beauty of it all. I'm in Los Angeles where it was a quiet and somber affair as a 2nd wave of infections made a verocious sweep through the city claiming lives every minute of the day for several weeks. Probably the darkest hour in our city's history... all while we welcomed a new and hopefully more merciful year.  With that said, it warms my heart that London ALWAYS UNDERSTANDs THE ASSIGNMENT. Always the right tone despite the unbelievable circumstance. Goodspeed my friends on the other side of the pond. I very much look forward to touching down there once again soon.   Much love,  An American who survived two viruses...Trump then Covid.... and just barely.
Why not have the event in the same place every year?

YAY 2021 COME YAY I LOVE WHEN IT'S 2021 I AM SO GLAD AND HAPPY I LOVE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Omg
Idk why but i think 2021 is better now than 2020 because his more calm than 2020 and the cases of covid decrease a little more
When we will have our children in the future, will all tell our children the means when it has taken to survive in 2020
Everyone: Finally we quit 2020 2020: *2021 is my brother year*
...and so begins a revolution.
Happy New Year Welcome 2021!🎉🎊🙏🎇🎆🧨🎈
When I Was Sleeping In London I HEAD LOT OF FIREWORKS I Recorded it
fragile the man said at the end? of course its fuckin fragile theres a war still in northern ireland?
I saw fireworks outside my house on my tv i stay awake until 12pm and then 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1... BOOM!  HAPPY 2021 EVERYONE LETS GOOOO BABY       but covid-19 go away
6:55 was that spongebob
Bye 2020 hello 2021
The Living God loves us all so very much that He sent His sinless Son Jesus, to earth, to be born of a virgin, to grow up & die on the Cross for our sins.  After He died on the cross for our sins, Father God raised Him to life again, & he appeared to people and went back to heaven.We must receive Jesus into our life sincerely to be His child(John 1:12) & after we get saved by grace through faith, we need to obey Jesus if we really love Him(John 14:15).  Jesus said in Mark 1:15 says "And saying, the time is fulfilled and the Kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe the Gospel." John 14:15 Jesus said: "If ye love Me keep My commandments."  Revelation 21:8 says: "But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, there part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone..." Please receive Holy Jesus-- sincerely and repent, before it's too late. :)
This should be about unity not divided peoples on different continents. Shame on you England to caving to black lives matters. 🖕🏿👉🏻👌🏻
Everyone: yay Covid-19 will be over soon! Me: yay! Big ben will get it's scaffolding removed!
Already 3 months old😭🤧

THANKS NHS 🙂🙂
Captain is a legend sad he left us :(
a big lie -

It's my Birthday April's Fool
This was very emotional. We love you NHS, rest in peace to those who helped and to those who sadly perished because they couldn’t fight anymore. Couldn’t bare to see those suffer, they are watching over us. Rest in peace Captain Sir Tom Moore, you and all will be missed 🥺💕
Happy New Year Welcome 2020!
Can I just say how amazing it was this year, lots of locations, Big Ben, the shard, tower bridge etc. Then the drones in the sky making all the images, not to mention the cheer amount of beautiful fireworks, and then the “you’re on mute” was brilliant.

I love it when the bird comes up singing I will leave the light on
Best NYE ever🥰 so emotional🥰
Thank you NHS hero’s for helping us get through the year and covid 19

Support nhs
No humans its pandemic
Brilliant!!!....even got a sneaky reference to the bieed b c theme in there...Exploiting the great of this country to pursue agendas that no one really cares about...we know right from wrong but we also know  a forced agenda when we see one...Let us live and settle in our own way...the more we are pushed the more we will resist...and no one wants that
amazing happy new year

I miss new year :((
I'm not just saying this because I live in London but this has probably been the most heartfelt and beautiful fireworks in the whole world ever. I'm not a Cryer. I never cry. But this. I cried and hard.
2020 + 1 = 2021
Teachers will show this to their students in 10 years and they won't get why their teachers start crying.
I hope we will turn. This aroud
That love heart relief to cheryl xx
I so this when I was not sleep I heard the sound the arena
Thank you Jesus that we all didn't perish. Your blood is sufficient for us all. Help us to turn to you repents of our sins. Know that you are God. Remove the spirit of separation and help us to unite love each other. Let this yer be a year of hope and learning from past by being each others keeper as your word states. Father turn the hearts of every nation to you. Help us to turn to you and acknowledge your the one true ALMIGHTY GOD. THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD. AS 2 chronicles 7 verse 14 states if my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Turn our hearts to you Jesus. Amen. John 16.23..
why is this better than the usual fireworks, why dont we have drones again next year
I swear, I couldn’t stop playing the Captain tom moore firework.   R.I.P MY CAPTIN!

I absolutely can not believe the lights above the O2 were drones. The immense work that must have gone into programming all of the movement is crazy. Huge props to everyone involved, 2020 was a unique year and this celebration encapsulated everything we have to be thankful for.
happy

2021
I went to bed at 11pm on NYE so I'm only now watching this, unbelievably. Given the events of the past five years (starting with a certain 2016 vote), I thought the days of me being proud of my country were over. There's still a lot we need to fix, but this display was such a welcome reminder of what the UK can achieve and overcome. I haven't felt like this since the incredible 2012 opening ceremony. It felt so good to be proud of Britain again for a few minutes - I cried.
Thank you Captain Sir  Tom Moore we will miss u soo much xx ❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 we love u xx
I'm not crying ur crying (this was the best show I have ever been delited to witness like wow) rip captain tom u will always be in our hearts
I really don’t know how we’re going to top this
I love 2021 I like 2021 ❤❤❤
So emotional
This gives me goosebumps just watching this, rest in peace Captain Tom 1920 - 2021, It's been such a hard year in 2020 and now we are in 2021 hopefully we will get back to some normal, thank you so much for nhs staff and key workers you don't know how much you mean to us.
rest in peace sir captain tom moore
Rip captain sir Tom Moore. Also, thank you so so much for your help NHS. Love from Sydney Australia Edit 1 at 31/12/2021 at 5:11 Respect for the NHS There.

R.I.P  Captain Tom 1920 - 2021 Died because of Pandemic So sad
Welp, we survived 2020. But something tells me we have something much worse coming
The show was produced by Jack Morton Worldwide. Fireworks were done by Titanium fireworks. The Drones by SKYMAGIC.
❤❤❤❤
Total waste of snakes.

And it ended with David Attenborough. Perfection!

The production manager & team on this need a mil!!
Im scottish and as much I love the edinburgh fireworks (glasgow) I 've always loved watching the London one and when you see Big ben chive it makes it look more offical into the new year
Whoever was behind this all I can say is Thank You, you actually made my night that day/night. I thoroughly enjoyed the drones and lazer light effects, hope they get used every year. I liked how they helped to tell the story of 2020.
2020 was one fucked up year
Rewatching this now sir Tom is gone stings so much more 😣 fly high sir Tom 💕
Goodbye 2020 we all missed you
Good

It makes me so proud to be British 🇬🇧 I have to say this could not of been any better in these circumstances. I think we are the only nation in the world 🌎, who raised these important facts in there New year message and help raise the profile of subjects that really do need to be raised and respected. We really can do anything. Thanks captain Tom, Sir David and all those who raised the profile BLM ✊🏿 but above all, I praise you NHS 👩‍⚕️ for going out and risking your own lives to save mine. I Love you UK 🇬🇧 I’M GRINNING LIKE A CHESHIRE CAT.

Best display London has ever put on and in such difficult circumstances. Still get emotional watchin it again. Big thumbs up to the team. Beat that world
And here we see explosions and awesome drone displays, that cost at least a whole GDP of a third world country :D
anyone know whats the name of the tune in the beginning (before the Big Ben chime) of this video?
A Beautiful Phoenix :3
Funny how they ended with the Attenborough speech when this contributed towards global warming
My dad works with the NHS and I remember when me and my family were all watching this on new years eve and I almost cried because I remembered that my dad isn't just my hero but he's a hero to others and I just felt really happy, I hope everyone can have a better 2021 and I'm sorry to anyone who lost any family members to corona virus, I lost my auntie to it so your not alone everyone, stay strong ❤❤❤ (Also just to clear it up, my dad has been helping children in the children corona wards since 2020 and has saved many of them who have been suffering in hospital due to corona! Its sad that he couldn't save them all which sadly makes him feel guilty a lot. He has just recently has retired from being a doctor and now works in a local pharmacy and will be giving the vaccine to children above the age of 5 very soon! Thank you all for your support though and I wish you a great 2022! Since I wrote this paragraph in January 2022 😁)

It was all silent on new years eve and the police and the military were wondering on the streets sending everyone home... Madness... As a sound technician and future sound engineer I just hope that one day I can get back to my job which I truly love! Happy New Year!!

Happy new year 2021
Soon as  I saw that bird, first thing I thought of was that it was representing those that didn't make it to see 2021. Not just because of the virus, but those who gave up the fight because it was too tough!  They're finally flying high and free like a bird 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ anyone else feel it?
This 🥺
2021 COVID 19

i was alone on new years eve, and the only one awake, i was just sitting there during the last 10 minutes listening to peaceful music, thing about all the good things that happened to me before lockdown, getting emotional on the last day of year 6, making lots of new friends and memories online, starting secondary school, you see, even though 2020 was bad there were some good moments, and as soon as i heard my neighbours count down i was in tears
2016:걍 포기 하고 (욕) 2017:흑 안돼는거 알아 흑흑 2018:아니 쟨 표정이 이상해 2019:흑그극흑헠흑 2020:ㅣㅏㄴㅁㄹㅇㅌㅊㅍㄷㄱ먀ㅓ래어아아아아아아아아아 안대 안대!!!!! 2021:하하 이때만을 기다려 왔다 1900년대들:야들아 걍 포기해 임마(안보고 말하는것이 포인트) B.C:멍~ 호랑이가 담배피던 시절:우가우가(포기포기)

By far the best fireworks
Loved it
Man drone shows never cease to impress. We are truly living in the future.
Hello guys Hope you guys enjoyed the display Im London Fireworks worker working at Kimbolton with Titanium Fireworks brought this spectacular. Soon early as march we will do developing phase of 2022 theme negotiating with London Mayor and planning Soundtrack in June.
So this is true I was here and I was doing my first kiss with my bf on the "love together" and im 18 he's 19 so yh
The BBC, Black Bull crap corporation promotes the BLM, Black lies matter, while black washing history and promoting anti white hate. If they said white lives matter every one would lose it, butt sadly the days of free speech is nearly at an end and the truth will be forgotten and our children will be punished for crimes there eldars did not commit, tought by marxist libral teachers in schools and promoted by the BBC.

Cut the politics and just focus on beauty!
better than mericas lmao

Wow.......😦
To everyone who's reading this i just want to congratulate you'll for surviving 2020 season 1 :>
Just got round to watching this, fantastic job, thank you x
C by C C h.   9
Disgraceful. BLM is a political organisation and has no place in these fireworks - their anarcho-communist ideas are not welcome here. And why the yellow and blue colours of the EU - lefties are just sore we’ve left! Khan needs to go and the BBC needs to have the licence fee revoked
Amazing
“Thank you NHS Heroes” wow that hits to the heart especially with the song of Ella wow such a chilling feel amazing
wow
bin crap so far no job propa getting to me because i need refresher courses to do what i'm skilled in
Whoever is listening my grandma died
4:25
The best thing from 2020!
Whoever moans about this being "over politicized" or felt anger towards this quite frankly is a knobhead
Why you gotta make me cry like that
Om the thumbnail was so nice
Happy new year 2021

Hi im London NYE worker and we may do developing stage around march. And Soundtrack will be panned as normal despite no corwds but we have to wait and see. We may do disclosed location like this year.
This is a amazing, doesn't matter how many times i watch this makes me cry. Well done to the people that created this. 2020 will definitely a year all of us wont forget. We need to all pull together now and make 2021 a better year. We can do this. Stay safe everyone, protect each other.

Jeeze the future is bleak and scary. The push for a new age new global movement is heavy. 2021 is the start of it all.
Whats the song of 6:30 min.???
One morning, I fell in love with life. Now my heart is anxious, look at me, I have a new video here. Drew Spider-man on his iPad with ApplePencil
When the child said thank you nhs heroes 🥺
The drones look way cooler and the countdown from the shard was so cool
Thank you NHS for all your hard work massive thanks all lifes matter
That's AMAZING well done
2020: oh no! 2021: anyways
Covid-21 count down

Lol
Khan is a fcucking disgrace
Guess the emoji . the🎭
Tor TV
These light shows can't replace fireworks, embarrassing hahahah  ￼
Everyone is 2120: people say they call the year 2020 the year of disaster
Wow it was all really cool, but why the BLM stuff? It just seemed like a cheap political jibe to me. But apart from that amazing! Rule Britannia!🇬🇧🇬🇧
Amazing I wish this year will be a good year
Bang Bang Bang KITchen Gun
Happy new year
BBC: this video contains flashing lights Everyone else: yeah no shut jackass
Do more next year
I I stayed up till 12 o’clock
Defund the BBC
who else screamed at the top of their lungs "IT'S OVER"  when they watched this
I was born in London so if i was still there i could see it all
While me sleeping in my bed at 12:00 am thinking I have no friends
2:43
I LOVE YOU BBC
How was this already a week ago
YAY
I sore this at 12:00
gay
What was the point in bringing political things that only a small amount of people like? That just means most of us can't trust your news source. Blm and NHS shouldn't be brought into fireworks. Defeats the point. Anyway: N
The birds be like :😳😳😳

Happy New Years
I follow everyone that likes this comment, keep it up!!
Better than America’s ball drop
Happy New Year Welcome 2021 By Hopefully
they could have spent this money on coronavirus vaccines though
The new year's wish for 2021 is for the whole nation to make a lot of efforts not only to fight The Corona 19 virus but also the global warming. ^^ The Corona 19 virus, which is now prevalent in green planet Earth, may be a warning of global warming in a way. ㅠㅠ 🚒🚔🚭🚯♻️ 😢   To save the Earth!  1. Walk or ride a bike for a short distance, and if you don't need a car, use public transportation.  2. Give milk to calves and eat vegan dairy products! "In addition, I heard that milk is harmful to the body. Cows' farts are also responsible for global warming!" Honey also gives way to honeybees, and replace them with maple syrup. 3. Garbage collection is mandatory! Use shopping bags instead of plastic bags!  4. Use strawless lids instead of straws when ordering a McDonald's drink!  5. Factory smoke purification facilities are required! All sewage treatment facilities are required!  6. Plant grass or trees on an empty land without owners!  7. Turn off unused lights! Unplug unused plugs or disconnect power!  8. Use natural detergents, and use only a small amount of chemical detergents!!  9. Work hard on alternative energy!!  10. Reduce food waste! 11. Try electric vehicles instead of fuel cars!  I also heard that the warmer the Earth gets, the higher the spread of infectious diseases... crying Everyone works hard to defeat Corona 19 and those infectious diseases! Let's save our sick Earth!! ^^ 😉👨‍🌾[🥤🚫]  And if you think there are a few more things to save the Earth, please leave a comment here.^^ ❤❤
Greetings from Norway 2020/21 Happy new year! @
So much important words writen by Drones. For me the best NYE 2021 <3
✨🧨🎇🎆🎆✨✨🧨🎇🎇🎆🎆✨
Im over here thinking how is that number in the air?
Great before it got political. Drone usage was amazing though
Disappointed at the missed opportunity to use a virus shaped firework

Fireworks like no other. Amazing! Especially the blue bird
WELL DONE NHS 👏💖💗
Love the fireworks, messages and lights and love the Music!! Say my name, blinding lights, dancing in the moonlight, leave a light and Coldplay! My favs
They had to add that BLM crap didn't they! 😑
Music ??
Wow......
They do this and get applauded   I do it and I get an electric bill
This is so sad :(
Im Australian And i live in the U.K. I've Gotta Say this is Wonderfull Scenery
Where It all Starts 0:48 - 1:56 To 10:01
Six, Five, FOUR. Three, Two, One 0:51
And Black lives matter BLM
2020 The Year We All won't forget
When I Watched It Live on BBC ONE It looked Better
AMAZING SHOW !  I think the NYE Fireworks and Drone show is the way to go in the future with the 02 Arena, Shard and Tower Bridge al involved.  Well done everyone involved !
wow
Watching from Singapore. I can say the fireworks this year are still a hit xcept for the disturbing BLM symbol which brings back bad memories. Harmony will never happen so easily at all. And lastly, the NHS has at least done their best to serve the country even in the midst of a new dangeeous strain of COVID-19.
It is 2021 already, upload a video in fullhd at least ahahaha
Am filling good dealing with +1 (4752120687) I just got my first payment 1000pounds
I have had many disappointments and setback from fake hacker, but when I met +14752120687 on WhatsApp I recovered all my lost
I don't know why but i got really emotional seeing this in the 31st
that is sooo creative
how do you do it
best  thing ever
i love it
this is sooooooooo coooool i want to be there
woooooaaaaahhhhhhhhh
Che merda
Lôn don nam nay bị dịch to ,cũng ban pháo hoa ăn mừng nam moi hầy ,cố lên nhé
I’ve been dreaming to see big messages in the sky for 15 years.
The US could never...
Its kinda emotional tbh <3
So do you really want to give the NHS to Trump? "everything is on the table"...
;
i have nevre got passport, and going to anothor country only just staying my country. but... whenever i watch this cowntdown movie, i really like it and so cool! i will waiting for next year 2022  movie from staying my country from now own.  thank you bbc,and thank you england.  from  japan osaka prefecture.
We are just all inhabitants of this planet, and everything always has an end except eternity.
Much better idea to have the fireworks and lights spread out rather than just in front of the London eye,  makes it much more entertaining.
I hate to say this but I don’tn’t like 2021
When it was talking about black lives matter and played Stormzy, I got shivers
Plz Some one Tell me backgroud Song or music ?
Welcome to another episode of 'where our tax money goes'
Omg I love this!!!!!! 💖🥰

Congratulations to London's 2021 fireworks. Happy New Year 2021 to all United Kingdom residents. May 2021 brings you all Good Health, lots of sharing with friends and family.
Who's watching this for the 2nd time?I am its amazing
Oh my God it is so beautiful.
Sorry, i know it is a lockdown but there should ofbeen more lazers,fireworks scare animals,lazers are cheaper so would of prefered them and money left to go to nhs services. Glad Captain Tom was shown.
Oh My God this is Great I wish I was awake at midnight
That one plane trying to fly over London while 50 lights shine into the plane.

6:58 😍😍. Any XO here?
Thanks to coderlouis5 On Instagram for helping me recover my account back. He's super fast
me watching it on repeat for the beat drop of I will leave a light on
Really pissed me off who they involved blm in the fireworks display, blm has nothing to do with the new year and they just ruined it by putting politics into what could’ve been a great fireworks display.
How did you do that
2021 wow los juetes Son geniales
is  incredible
@ Socialblade
When it became 2021 technically the first day was the worst day of the whole year!
Happy New Year London. I pray I'll be there someday.
wow!! Happy New Year guys xx

😘🌆❤️🇰🇭
Cuda done without the BLM message. Great otherwise. Nice to see praise given to healthcare...wish we did more of this in the US
My home country 😍, supposed to go home after 6 months of travelling. 16 months away from home due to COVID. Happy to be in Australia where it's safer than the UK but makes me sad watching this. Hopefully it gets better there in 2021
Happy New Year Welcome Hopefully By 2021!!!!
I might be nit picking but the fireworks where way to over exposed most of the time.... That's the only problem with the drones as you have to have a slower shutter otherwise the drones start flikering. Lol Id be surprised if anyone else noted that 😂
This might be a stupid question. Can you actually hear the music and songs/sounds when you are there? or is it just fireworks
Hello from Uzbekistan

Thank you for the happiest year of my life!
Whoever disliked this doesn’t like Fireworks and hope.
I live in W1 london and was warned to stay away from the river. I was told there would be no fireworks. Can you see a pattern forming? If you have said to yourself in the last 12 months that anyone questioning covid are Conspiracy theorists, sleep well. There is a clock ticking against your heart....
Happy new year everyone from UK ❤

It really does look like the Eye of Sauron. And what a better way to end the year than giving the middle finger to the native people of England?

Oh my yikes
*The Most Over Rated City in the World!*

This is great! Don't need the fireworks though. Save the money and keep using drones instead. The message will probably come across as more powerful too.
That's so sad that there was only one boat for the fireworks, normally there would be 5-4
Happy new year london🇬🇧💪🏻🤜🏻
Proud to be English seeing this. Amazing. Here's to 2021 England 🎆
♾
lets all how all the year become good year and better😊

Happy New Year London❤️  -from New York
London new year 2021 is definitely my favorite  ...
I'm still amazinged of how amazing and wonderful this years fireworks where. I still can't believe they tought of something like this I love it so much. And I'm so happy for what the future brings us. I know at the moment it feels like we are standing back a bit. But I feel like somthing amazing is around the corner. We just have to wait to feel free a little long. Happy new year agian world much love xx💖🌍🌎🌏🥰
Wow
Wow
Thank You 2020 Welcome 2021!!!!
Thank You 2020 Welcome 2021!!!!
I have to admit, the tribute to Captain Tom Moore was a real tearjerker.  The drones were the undeniable centerpiece of this show and I'm excited to see what they'll come up with at the end of this year.
Wow this stunning😭👌🏾👌🏾🔥🔥
U CAN TELL THIS IS A LEFTY LOSERS PARTY SADDICK JUST F OFF U USELESS WORTHLESS LITTLE MAN.  Y HAVE HE EU COLOURS ON THE LONDON EYE WE R NOT IN THAT NAZI CLUB.  WHAT HAS BLM GOT 2 DO WITH THE NEW YR
Wow
Dllllon Dllllo you can 🎇
Dllllon Dllllon Dllllon 🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆
*WoW*
BLM? Are you serious???
This is the biggest display of propaganda I have ever witnessed, is this supposed to cover over the crimes the government is committing against the public? They should have had a huge glowing police boot stomping on an innocent protestors face, it would have been more accurate. Do not fall for the lies, they are not on our side, this is all part of the larger con game. We are not all in it together, check out who is getting super rich from this while the ordinary people of the world are being force poisoned with vaccines. How many members of government are making huge sums of money out of this fake Scamdemic? Start thinking for yourselves people, don't let them hypnotise you with bright lights and pretty colours.
olha o hercules puga, logo mais vem vídeo novo 🕺💃
This year was by far the nicest
Shill Propaganda. We don't want to see and hear fake pandemic death cult garbage like this. There's no virus no deaths just massive redistribution of weath to a group of psychopaths... People need to get out hit the streets and stop believing the lies.. Hug and kiss one another, reconnect as humans... Do not fear nature but very much you need to fear these technocratics with their unnecessary vaccines and the ever increasing restrictions to free human Speech, movement and surveillance state future they're forcing on us
It kind of felt like youtube rewind

fireworks ... just wow... wonderful fireworks .........tnx ... nice video capture
2020 bye bye 2020we all will miss u
На видео видно, как возле моста очень много летало испугавшихся птиц, которые где-то рядом мирно спали....
I loved everything <3 apart from the fact of watching real birds flying away or die by the Fireworks. There must be another way of celebrating without going against living creatures. We definitely can do it!
The sirens of the emergency vehicle at the end gave the perfect London vibe to the video
Peace to all!!
America sucks compared to this
this is more better than prevoius year
Modern Sauron Tower - the symbol of world surveillance :D

I will hit 2:45 every time I feel down this year.
Absolutely beautiful and inspiring
The communist propaganda is strong with this light show.
I never knew they did this in London and everyone hoping this year would be better 4 days into January 2021 and a new national lock down this is stupid! Appreciating the effort for the recorder BORIS IS STUPID HE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO DO
Happy New Year !
Happy new year 🥳

The drones are cleaver but all in all it was a bit shit.
How come this triggered so many SJWs?
I love it! Happy New Year guys!

Man, F+ck you. I see you at work.

Id rather that 1.5M had gone in to something useful other than using a celebratory event as a Marxist political propaganda campaign.   1.5M could have helped prevent hundreds of black teenagers dying in  2020 with more cops/insensitives/initiatives.

The bird hit me hard ALL the NHS need a god damn pay raise after the bs they've had to deal with. They are the true backbone of this country, without them, we wouldn't be here
The comments from fascist loons are very funny. Wackos are always hilarious. 😄
The drones were the best thing about this! Great show. Get rid of fireworks tbh.. They're pretty samey these days and bad for environment anyway
incredible
Brainwashing big style
you SUCK!
To anyone who has actually been to watch the fireworks in person, do they play music and these voice-overs there too or only for the videos?
Pathetic
žu
OMGGGG
Worlds best in London, always

Britain needs no imports..........unless they like bacon.
I live in london near the shard and I saw lights coming in the sky so I was there!
I watched this on bbc 1
Why didnt they have it at the london eye instead of a big office building. Seemed dull compared to last year.
wow in slemani where i live they just shooted really loud fire works it was nothing like this

If it had Mr beast in the title it would've got more than 40M+ views.
It will cause environmental pollution.
What are these comments lol
Eeeeeeeek
The BBC are propagandists.
I love it so much
I believe my brother is pretty famous....
So beautiful and inspiring!!!  HAPPPPPPY NEW YEAR!!!
Lol O heared them and I cloud not sleep
Embrace the people who got sick but not the damn lies people. The only hope they’re going to offer you in 2021 is a vaccine that will take your life. And why did they waste all that money on pyrotechnics? That truly sucked.
The propaganda machine hard at work here.
So beautiful! Well done to the organisers - a tremendously moving and uplifting way to end 2020 and bring in 2021!

Cool

The nhs don't want your thanks, they want a pay rise because they deserve it.
Whats with the communist nazi shite tho
All of the hate comments are Americans pissed that our fireworks where way WAY better since we included all the problems England aren’t homophobic so stop judging by
😲👏🏼
Turning grandpas ashes into fireworks  Call it going out with a bang.
شكرا 😍 I love u all doing our world
The spurious trunk initially rush because mole hemperly question till a irate stream. cut, sulky plot
This was the best NYE celebration fireworks I've ever seen. I just about cried.
Thank you so very much London for such a stunning beautiful New Year's display and for the message of hope and love! You have shown us how to begin this new year without negativity, sadness and despair!!
HAPPY BLOODY NEW YEAR CHAPS!

Some lunatics in this comment section. 😬😬
Spend money in Vaccine and for jobs......... what a waste
I was looking at this in outside my window by the way I live right next to it so I got a great view (:
Job good very good very nice firework
MALIGAYANG BAGONG TAON! ❤🇵🇭🎉
Can everyone just shut up and enjoy the fireworks? I agree our politics can be shitty sometimes LIFE can be shitty sometimes but if we act miserable about it we aren’t doing anything to help our situation are we? So for now let’s all just be happy that 2020 is over and look forward to a slightly brighter 2021 -Sincerely a hopeful and slightly pissed off British person
A much more lethal and much wider spreading virus: political correctness.
This doesn't lool so victorian to me man
Everything about this; the lights, the fireworks, the drone footage, the timing of all the fireworks shooting into the air, this is an absolute amazing start to the new year. We have left 2020 behind us because we have now started a new 365 day road. 2020 was full of doubts, fears and quarantines and now look at this. This is opening us into the world again to start a new year, a new life as a worldwide community. We all love everything that everyone has done to find this vaccine and to heal everyone. We all wanted the same thing for Christmas and New year's Eve and Day... To be together with our families and to put the old road behind us and to start new memories with the ones we love. We all love each other and Happy New Year!!💕💕💕💕😙😃😃😃😃🎆🎇🎇🎇🎆🎆🎇🎇🎆

You know I never really had an opinion on blacks and multiculturalism, until my government kept ramming it down my throat. Now I hate them, they call me racist and I say "Good".
Isn't Big Ben near complete?

It’s so pretty wow fireworks 🎆
It’s an end of year celebration payed for by the tax payer. You didn’t consult all tax payers of their political beliefs. Take the politics out. The people behind this ought to be ashamed.
I'm confused. Why does this video reached 10k dislikes?
What's music?
*HAPPY NEW YEAR FRIENDS!!!*
No blm in Israel but they do own it lol

More people need to die and that BLM
Come on yes do the fireworks
No multiculturalism in Israel! OY VEY
I'm so like this one 🥳🎄🎆 Happy New Year 2🥳21!
Belíssimo.
To all those morons out there who are criticising the BBC - let's just get one thing straight. The BBC neither paid for or choreographed any of this event. Their duty, as a public service broadcaster, was to televise the event for the British Public. I had the honour of working on  it and was sworn to secrecy over about three months of planning so that crowds wouldn't turn up on the night. I personally feel proud and honoured to have been a part of it. So to all you Daily Mail readers  maybe you should think about switching to a different newspaper... Happy New Year by the way.
First round of bat soup is on me.
Happy brexit... dumb !!
Enoch Powell was right.  Yuri Bezmenov was right.  Thomas Jefferson was right.  _“The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants.”_ You cannot vote out this rot. You must BURN it out. Commence the big igloo.
Nice hypocrisy. 👍
Spectacular fireworks,Happy New Year to All
Made me emotional!
What a waist of money pathetic!  The government must have plenty of money to burn
I see a load of American boomers have found this video and spreading their delusions and hysteria
Wahnsinns Feuerwerk, obwohl angeblich eine Mutation des , wie heißt es noch mal ach ja corona geben soll wurde dennoch gefeiert und Feuerwerk gezündet! Hier in dem scheiß Deutschland wurde Feuerwerk zu kaufen verboten! Unsere Regierung ist ........ Hier wird man nur für dumm verkauft! Gott segne die queen!
Thank you to everyone that kept the NHS and the emergency services safe and thank you for keeping us traffic management operatives safe during this difficult time
I have no idea how the government kept this secret from us, but it was genius and amazing
Absolutely amazing!! but a little disappointed cuz there was no Coffin song                  But in all seriousness this was amazing and the messages just made everything better :)
WOOOAHHHHHH BYE 2020!!!! DON'T COME BACK!
Leave it to ldn to deliver the best Nye celebration
I cried at the end..
We asked for it (2020) to be so special and it turned out to be such, like 1999 to 2000. What a year gone by. Never seen such since 2000.

wow
they talk about saving the planet from pollution and then do this. we need a new age guy fawkes to sort these clowns very soon
Hello 2023 we are now in 2021 remember the rubbish year of 2020 see you later

Bye bye BBC, your ratings are falling well done all who has cancelled their licence !!
Full of pollution
2021 🥳
Burn loot murder
Absolutely disgusting. It's a shame that we're still polluting the atmosphere with these fireworks. I fully agree with all the BLM messaging and thanking the frontline workers but this level of expenditure on pollution is just awful. There are a million better ways to celebrate. Shameful.
Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
What Coldplay song is that at 8:21 ?
Look in to my eyes look into my eyes , you're all racists !

Dude this is soo cool!!!
I noticed the clenched fist of the Marxist revolutionary group BLM, in the ‘new year’s fireworks display’. Shame on whoever arranged for this and other political messages to hijack the New Year.
好漂亮！

That's soooooooooooooooooo good
Ok I’m just a kid I need some help understanding all this. Please don’t leave hate but can someone please help explain some of the more subtle stuff because I don’t see all of it. I got the broken Europe stuff and “your on mute” is a metaphor for how we have no voice in our democracy but why are people repeating the phrase “voting will not remove them?” And stuff.

WOW BIG BEN FINALLY RANG
Goodbye 2020
Happy new year✨
crap
Parabéns !!!!! Que espetáculo grandioso
I saw Dubai one this year it’s was spectacular,imagine what Dubai can do with drone technology used here.
Pro tips for 2021: If you do something illegal and the police are required, their attendance doesn't constitute "racism". If you're a violent thug and the police are required to use force to stop you, that doesn't constitute "racism". If your people are by and large responsible for the majority of crime and police arrest your people in higher numbers, that doesn't constitute "racism".  If you want your life to matter then be a better person. Protesting because police apprehend criminals for criminal behaviour makes you look a bit simple.
2021
Sad this that London made this event in a way that has made people fight each other in the comment section. This was a lot better when it was just the fireworks with the music and I have the terrible feeling that this is going to stay like this from now on. This went from being my favorite thing to my least favorite. Disappointing.
British check
SO PRETTY
Que espetáculo  lindo
.                                            🖕
top most liked comments are weird. Came here to celebrate another revolution around the sun, not to find people  recommending Neo-Nazi documentaries and talking about NWO shit. lol
✨🎇🎆🍾🍾🍾👍👍👍🍾
It was not preached to the crowd, It was not taught by the State...
Can someone explain why there's so much hate in the comments? have i missed something?
Jay
This is meant to be a time to be happy we don't need the burn loot murder [BLM]  symbol ruining it
🧑🏿🤜🏿🤛🏼🧑🏼
OMG its a political message not a celebration of the new year. No Union Jacks. What makes Khan think BLMs the most impiortant issue to Britains? There is gay equality, environment crisis, if you want to get political.
Catboykami approves this political correct Message!
why’s everyone so salty over this ? this is amazing and my part in tax was deffo worth it 💓

Big Ben ticking was cool haven't seen that before but the blm stuff has to stop everyone hates it
So sad...😞

BLM stands for Burn Loot Murder
@BBC Does anybody know the song at 6:22 when they show the wembley stadium? May someone can put a link in the comment
WHERE IS THE "HAIL MOSLEY" FIREWORK?

thanks the people of britian for that awesome firework display,especially the display showing our planet earth and the message that was spoken our planet really need s healing,i also like the firework display over london bridge magnifficent,im from barbados,due to covid 19 retrictions this new year was the first time we didnt have a firework display,i recently lost my dad ,and my mom died when i was younger,2020 was a very hard year for me im seeing a pscycloogist and i hope i will get better what i can do now is try to focus on the positive during these frightening times HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU AND ALL MAY THINGS GET BETTER
Nauseating political messaging...whether you agree with the politics or not, this is unacceptable.
wonderful fireworks                 i love it london is also my favourite
2:24 song ?
Beautiful  message nice gesture from the governments to its people. Invest in their happiness even if its just for one day
Very divisive & lacklustre

I was in London 2010 for the new year.
Start packing up your desks BBC employees. You have put so many nails in the lid of your own coffin that the lid isn't ever coming off. Cancel your licences people. This company has no respect for the British.
Beautiful fireworks!) but BLM spoils everything, as always

🥳🥳🥳🥳😉😉😉😌😌
That's a Pog
This is brilliant. One of the best videos I have seen in 2021
Honestly I would have liked the fireworks display without the music, sound effects and narration. Think whatever you will about the message, but some things are just better when you can bask in the glow of it. Fireworks, a nice fire, a volcanic eruption, all these things are wondrous on there own without pop music and cheesy messages playing over them. It just gets distracting. As for the drones, the choreography is mind blowing and certainly a feat of modern technology, but I would have left them out altogether. The reason for the narration is because without it, the images of the drones without context would be confusing - a doctor, a sea turtle, etc. But because I feel like the narration was just distracting, I would have either done something else with the drones or just removed them altogether. Drones are great for light shows, but I think it's more difficult fitting them into a fireworks show because they are two different mediums. Part of the fun of fireworks is that they're only a temporary flash of light followed by a terrific bang. Drones in contrast are small, can stay on for extended periods of time and don't make much noise. That's why I think drones, like lasers and other electronic devices are better put with music, narration and choreography to give them context. Fireworks don't usually need an explanation. Even in the times I've seen fireworks added to music it was usually done in a way where the fireworks themselves were like an instrument. This display felt more like the music and fireworks were fighting against each other.
They should get the Undertaker to make an appearance on top of the Big Ben one year
I liked this more when it was just the fireworks. Also using this event to show social messages was disappointing, this used to be an escape from all that for a good 10 minutes. A bit underwhelming in my opinion.
Sometimes Britan was a great empire, whitch I personally admire, but now brits themselves get colonized sad but who knows that be next, lets hope it will be new reconquista !
People have woken up to the anti white agenda....thank you BLM.....you are the gift that just keeps on giving.😏

Shame on london polluting air by buring crackers
yayy we love air pollution and destroying the planet!!
This is the most beautiful display I've ever seen! I've watched it like ten times. It's perfect and so on point with 2020, u all should be proud of ur country. I'm disgusted by ours here in America, sick of a stupid ball that doesn't move, lit up by billions of dollars in ads all over Times Square on screens which drowns out the ball. All I saw in Americas was a Kia an planet fitness ad, SOO GROSS!! London's made me cry but America will make a come back in 2021.
We have to think about our world. We have to think about pollution.  Because we have no other planat.
Sadiqs private party...
# Indonesia save
Someone different. Loved it 👏🥳
Happy new year 2021
Never interfere with the enemy when they are in the process of destroying themselves ..2021 the year of mass arrests
it's not the end,it's just the beginning.
Welcome com  new year 2021 ,🇧🇩
POLLUTION???????
Disgusting
So much air pollution and so much smoke, think about the carbon footprint, and where the F is the how dare you dumbo???
No sign that says "sorry for the no christmas"? Oh that is right, they don't have it because they don't care.
it's hard to believe that this is the BBC, I have no words, except 'mind blown', the licence fee is more than justified, because some people have mad skills right there, the music cuts, the fireworks.  This makes me want to start paying that license fee, but I probably won''t, but I want to, they can''t catch me anyway (they probably could, if they wanted to, but I wouldn't give a fk anyway, how much is it nowadays?).    Sending love, and what an amazing video.    You are amazing.  The collaboration involved was crazy, you guys have some mad skills, keep it going.  Happy New Year
Und wir in Deutschland dürften Lichter an und ausschalten
Beautiful display

HAPPY NEW YEAR AND HAPPY BREXIT!  GOD BLESS US ALL FROM AMERICA 🇺🇸!
Comments being blocked on this vid... I wonder why...
WAIT... Thank God it's over??? BUT what else is to come?  Have people listened to God, to His warnings?   People, judgment is coming.  2021 may be worse!  Jesus said these things would come to pass and WORSE things will, one day, come.  He has given us hope however, this by His Son... Please read...  The holy Bible,  Roman's 3:23 23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"  See all fall short.  We are made right with God by the payment Jesus paid on the cross with His life. He died and rose again on the third day. Paying our sin debt to God in full...IF one believes!  Holy Bible, book of john  chapter 3... 16“For God so loved the world,ithat he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.  Believe, turn from your sins and receive everlasting life. Follow Jesus by reading the Bible and finding a Bible believing church - one that calls Jesus Lord!   Call to Jesus today. He loves you - put your faith in Him today.
Omg it’s time to shine

Loved it!
The Brits Power have copied to perfection both China show and their dictatorship ways domination over their citizens lifes and privacy. Happy Brexit!!! I bet that the rich Brits will continue having luxury holiday in Europe.
Quite inspiring. I love how London did it differently and injected important takeaway messages.
It looks like I’m watching China show.
Drones,,China tech..they been  doing this shit for years..
It's a shame that people pay more attention to memes, funny and entertaining posts, and are apathetic to more important, pressing issues such as climate change which is related to COVID19. Prevention is better than cure. When will people take action and learn? 😕
oh jeez, I was late to this party.  Happy new year BBC,  I still like you, please keep it honest, that's why I love the BBC, and send my love to Emily Matlis, I love the way she doesn't give a fk when she actually does, her interviews with dickheads are well cool, I'd like her to interview me one day.  Keep BBC real and honest, and I'll have your back

"Our planet is unique; a living world of diversity and wonder. It's also fragile. With a new year comes the opportunity for change and if we act in 2021, we can make a world of difference. Together we can turn things around. Together we can restore our fragile home and make it a happy new year for all the inhabitants of planet Earth."
how dare they hide this from us

Hi everyone! I hope y'all are having a blessed day! 😁 If you are reading this, it's not by accident! God wants you to see this! ^^ Hosanna to the Lord! He is SO AMAZING!!!! ❤️😄❤️ There is only ONE God, the TRUE God, he is the maker of heaven and earth. And he made us in his image and likeness, male and female, with dignity, value, worth, and purpose! ❤️ He made us to worship him. But we chose to sin against him, to rebel against him, and to disobey him. So, as a result, we are separated from God and live under the foolish myth that to some degree, we are each our own God, declaring right and wrong, living our own life, by our own rules, and standards. And guess what! That God ♥️LOVINGLY♥️ came into human history as the man ♥️Jesus Christ fully God and fully man!♥️ He was born of a virgin and he lived a life without sin, though he was tempted in every way as we are. And he WENT to the CROSS and there he SUBSTITUTED HIMSELF for sinners. When Jesus went to the cross, he took WILLINGLY upon him the SIN of those who would come to trust him! ♥️ That means me, as a sinner, Jesus WENT to the cross and took upon himself ALL my sin, past, present, and future! 😭❤️ And Jesus Christ God who was a man, DIED IN MY PLACE, FOR MY SINS, PAYING MY DEBT TO GOD, AND PURCHASING MY SALVATION!!!♥️♥️♥️ Jesus' dead body was then laid in the tomb, and for 3 days, he was buried. On the third day, a Sunday, (which is why we worship on that day) Jesus ROSE in VICTORY over satan, sin, death, demons, and hell. And he COMMISSIONED us with the HOLY SPIRIT, to be MISSIONARIES telling this ♥️AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS♥️ that there's a ♥️God♥️ and PASSIONATELY, LOVINGLY, CONTINUALLY, RELENTLESSLY pursues us and he ASCENDED into heaven. And today, Jesus is ALIVE and WELL and he's seated on a throne, and he is ruling and reigning over ALL nations, ALL cultures, ALL philosophies, ALL races, ALL periods of time. And he is KING OF KINGS and he is LORD OF LORDS and he is RULING and REIGNING over ALL people, commanding EVERYONE EVERYWHERE to REPENT of EVERYTHING and he is COMING AGAIN to JUDGE THE LIVING AND THE DEAD, and those who trust in him, will enjoy ETERNITY and his KINGDOM of heaven FOREVER, and those who do not will SUFFER APART from him in the CONSCIOUS ENTERAL TORMENTS of HELL. That is what we believe, we believe is JESUS!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌♥️♥️♥️♥️ God bless you! 😄

This gave me chills..
Great display mared by a underlying woke message, please stop force feeding us this woke crap.
Beat Day Ever!!!
Am I the only one who though the last minute went very quickly
Beautiful
In my opinion this fireworks show is much better than all the other displays, it looks a lot better with laser lights
Burn Loot Murder, i support that BLM
Since John Deere, they didn't matter that much
Who knows what the countdown music is please?
А где банан в руке?
FᄃK ПIG3ЯƧ🔥🔥🔥

So much better that anything the US has done for New Years 😔. Absolutely beautiful display of images and fireworks.
Disgusting.
Tiktok
Wow I love it
Amazing
Racism is natural
语言恶毒，神什么叫由亚洲少数民族引起的？首发病历你知道在哪？
Christ died to give us eternal life. No Christ equals eternal damnation. Please receive Christ today for eternal salvation.
BLM = burn loot murder. That's what people in that organization has done
The return of Christ is imminent. If you want to be saved & go to heaven please pray the following prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, I repent of all my sins, iniquities, & transgressions. I humbly confess that I am a sinner & need your saving grace. I believe Your Son Jesus Christ died on the cross to save me from eternal damnation. I accept Him as my Savior. Please forgive me & accept me into your heavenly kingdom. Amen Now you'll need to stay in Christ by reading & studying your bible & live for Him everyday. Go to church & keep godly friendships. Pray. Fast. The Lord will give you His holy spirit to comfort you & help you live for Him. He loves you!!!!
No
London
Omg
I’m just here to like and piss of the racists 👍
2021 is going to be a great year for you!
On on hand it's nice to have something like this to enjoy but on the other they've previewed some of that Project Blue Beam tech and it feels like foreshadowing.
Romes last days.
Satanic
Cost?
Burn Loot Murder
Nice
Nice Burn, Loot Murder vigil
🤨
hooray BurnLootMurder logo. Biological garbage that should be wanished
Anyone have some fentanyl?
I hate communist
Drones were used in China last year.  HNY~
Please 2021 be a good year
WLM only
What's the countdown music
What wonderfuol good  bless . Hapy New year
Most of the people in the comments section are all racist idiots, please don't be like them and I don't recommend reading the comments on this video.
😄😄😄😄😄😄
Welcome 2021
it 20 21 here
This is badass
Why did they have to make it so political I love watching these every year and they didn't even focus on the fire works they focused on these drones lighting up messages that will just devide people not bring them together to celebrate the new year
Burn Loot Murder
cringe moment of 2021
d
The fireworks are just so amazing to see in Video 😍
Thanks for not promoting the fireworks anywhere you useless arrogant propaganda factory. Loads of people would have liked to have seen it (not the lefty UK hating propaganda obviously) but you just waste all the money that is thrown at you., No licence fee for me this year.
This is embarrassing.
⚡⚡
Wonderful . Happy New Year
What song did they use                             ITS BEAUTIFUL THIS FIREWORKS
Why are all the comments unfathomably based?
Good good des!
THE UK SUCKS WE WILL PROUDLY THROW YOUR TEA INT THE HARBOT AGAIN
Bbc sus Big. Black 8
CRINGE
They did NHS , Captain Tom , BLM  and LGBTQ all of that was just amazing
Witch way White man?
Happy new year! Have a great time too!
BURN LOOT MURDER= BLM
👍
Birdy
blm SUCKS!
I see for the first time BLM symbol without half of the City on fire, good job
The Burn Loot Murder symbol was the best part. Very progressive!
Burn Loot Murder
BLM = Burn Loot Murder
It was not preached to the crowd. It was not taught by the state No man spoke it aloud...
Wow they even worked in the Burn Loot Murder logo!
Disquisting
Best documentaries that you can find on Bitchute: - HELLSTORM - The Greatest Story Never told - Europa: the last battle

Burn Loot Murder

I liked the burn loot murder (blm) fist the most
What about the wooden doors, Tony? Dwane hates em
Very emotional 😢❤️❤️❤️
Happy new year
An absolutely hideous eyesore. Post-modernism at its finest.
Good to see China and Russia's troll farms at work! The comment section is full of random anti semetic racist comments that are highly upvoted. Not suspicious at all...
Just watching the countdown on January 2
White lives matter too.
Bldm
communist and black power fist on full display in the middle of London.... what the hell
Happy new year
idk why but im crying
So many subliminal messages in this.
2021 is going to be the mending year from the damage that 2020 did also  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!
Why does this make me cry 🥺
С новым годом!🇷🇺
The flying bird with the song was so good..
cool and exiting firewoks
Check out the Scottish version - Fare Well - Edinburgh's Hogmanay 2020
What bullsh+t
Big reset here we come.
Has been in best display over the years. Great reflection of 2020. Let's make 2021 one to remember for the right reasons, positive reasons.
Happy new year everyone, I hope this year brings everyone success they deserve and you are able to achieve your dreams.
On the TV they didn’t show any display of any kind. Weird.
That looks near  my auntie’s house
And I quote "the skies of London were only filled with a familiar electrical glow on new year's" sky news 2021
London gets this and America gets Ryan Seacrest, sounds about right😂😂😂
Worst firework display I've seen.
NHS 🎆🎇2021
Wooooooooooooow and hello 2021🌈🌈🌈🎆🎇
The BLM ✊ was out of order and intentionally divisive. It's common knowledge BLM are far left Marxist and just using racism as a diversion from their real agenda. London isn't the UK and the left wing oompaloompa mayor does not represent the views of the majority
BTW  this was 2 days ago
OMG
other now same state suburban violent intelligence tree limb perceive adjustment.
That's strange, I watched ITN news, there was nothing showing this display
It amazing
this is absolutly amazing this made my heart melt. Im sitting here with my watery eyes we are so lucky.
Hey si ati que leíste esté comentario Dios te bendiga grandemente🙏🏼♥️
happy New Years guys
Cool
Beautiful, creative and meaningful. Perfect ending to a shit year.
I thought London’s celebration was just watching Big Ben
Представляю после такого салюта как заваняло порохом, я за чистоту воздуха .
Drones were spectacular, could have done without the usual hectoring over the NHS, EU, BLM and the environment for once though
Happy brexit /New year UK  From Denmark
Our culture is being destroyed and all that will be left by 2050 are gay pride flags and blm fists.
This made me so soo emotional .. Im a frontliner for our NHS in my country.. and seeing this massage made my heart swell with Joy and appreciation. No matter what country we live in,  what language we speak, what ethnic group we're from. we of all have one common goal, to end COVID19 and restore normalcy and happiness..."Together"..Happy 2021 London!!! From Western Samoa!
I really like that can we have it every year I've started to count this year and I'm trying it 8💎💎

Sólo vine a ver si salía Blinding Lights y si uwu
Omg...... Happy new year.....in lockdown
Wow.  Toronto had like nothing.  They folded like a house of cards.  But on the other hand it kept people mostly indoors.
Not even the fireworks are free from the degeneracy
I love it but it’s my second time watching it first I watched it on a tv but now I’m watching it on a phone it so beautiful
they want us to adapt why should we what adapt to a virus we can stop but no it gives them money
The Drone Show was stunning  and very cool Tech. Meanwhile the Sugarcoated "kitsch"   was too much
OMG they did something nice for once instead of lying
😎🔥🤸‍♀️😎
All lives matter not just black ones
Alguien. Que hable español aquí ? Me encanto el vídeo quedó hermoso :3
Just wow
This hyperpatriotic, self-congratulatory garbage makes me very uncomfortable. You have completely ballsed up your response to the COVID outbreak, from your government down to your citizens lack of willingness to do what is necessary to prevent needless death. Your hospital system is at breaking point, and what do you do? Instead of enacting meaningful change, you just hang out the window and clap thinking that makes up for your complete disregard for social distancing and other precautions. I promise you that the overworked nurses and doctors getting hammered day in and day out watching people die of preventable causes do not give a shit that you lit some buildings up in blue. You have no good reason to be this proud of yourself.
I got 45,000$ on forex trading with @ensonfx on Instagram
Good
Wow beautiful display!
I liked this one better because not only it talks about 2020 it also releases the firework from many places and not just the London Eye!! England is the only country that has done it on many landmarks and not one place.... I believe it's only England...
l Señores
Very good one of the best displays for along while had a lot of mineing that really reflect the year.
gay waste of money lol
Help me start my year less poor Bitcoin adresse is here thanks guys 386y9FsFW7h6LZYLdNMt5hwSdvuywiSsbD

Now I wanna move to London   I don't mind seeing that firework show outside my window   And that 2021/bird/NHS thing is sick
I'm glad I no longer pay for TV licence, what a lot of bs politics
Amazing!!!
I was on zoom with my family and all of us were watching it and I was amazed by the drones 😯 (and my auntie lives not to far away from it so she probably saw it) cause I live in Ireland 🇮🇪
My spirit is rising  from suffering
Oh dear god the message from Sir David at the end was the height of cringe. First they spend what could been a boost to NHS bonuses on this bs and then they fly one hundred plastic drones with lithium batteries and cobolt in them in the shape of a turtle and the African continent. Hooooooly shit cringe overload.  With the rate of obsolescence in modern technology, a turtle will most likely choke on a propeller from one of those drones within a year.
Do black lives really matter?
The most disgusting show I saw in my life, and the socialist fist....
1.5 million pound of tax payers money wasted in a time like this for a political stunt.   And enough of this deification of the nhs, they're just doing the job we paid them to do.
I love it but I was not there😭😭😭😭😭
Eh, si vede che fuori dall'Unione il Regno Unito è spacciato...
Ok why was this so sweet? 🥺
The time for war is coming.
omg so cool
HAPPY NEW YEAR FOR ALL OF YOU🎊🎊🎉🎊🎊🎉🎊🎉🎉😊😊♥️♥️
BLM ✊🏿 shit 💩
Wow, narration, hey? I'm old enough to remember those days when the BBC had an ounce of integrity.
wow!  was it fantastic.....
*BREAKING* *NEWS* *ALL* *EPILEPTICS* *IN* *LONDON* *DEAD*
That literally blowed me away! I believe in drones now 😱
Me an adult watching this 👁👄👁
I much prefer this New Year’s Eve celebration, that addressed 2020 head on, to my own American ones, that pretended as if nothing has happened this past year! Thank you, UK, for making this. Wishing all of us a brighter new year!
oh great blm that riots. Cant they keep politics out of anything now?
Oh my god, I cried like never before, this was beautiful😭
I got this on my recommended and I don't regret watching it
Jfhehessjsje
Like the drones especially the bird one!! It looks dope plus the song leave a light on Like if u agree and hope u have a very good year, keep safe and watch BBC
Muchas gracias feliz año 😘😘😘
UK put the best display on globally and the drones wow
the other day, but I am a beautiful person to leave the house of Lords, I have a look at the moment, but I am a beautiful person to leave
Burn. Loot. Murder.  f in bbc
I think London smashed it. The best display out of any of the major cities in 2020.
Just how many lives did this cost rather than actually save the U.K?
how many drones was used for that?
Can you make another video
Loved that they included Captain Tom Morgan!!🎉🥂🎈🥰
COOL SHOW COOL MSG, DELIVERY WAS KINDA CRINGE DOE NGL
Like por los que son de latinoamerica
Quiero que regrese 2020
The World must end where it started.............LONDON
That why Tower Bridge was pack full of people. Thank you Mayor for spreading the Virus
Morning and then you can
WOW happy new year 🥳❤️
I watched this on the tv and it was literally magic
When your mum says you have 10 more minutes of screen time.
Hands down best firework show this year probs even the decade
HAPPY NEW YEAR ITS FRICKING 20218
💓💓💓💓
2020 - No fireworks this year. London - Hold my Beer!  Beautiful, emotional, clever. Happy New Year!
Yet there's a congestion charge in London
There is no political solution
فُےـعَےـفُےـفُےـفُےـغّےـ
Am I the only one who say the European Union flag on the bridge?  it is signalling, morally superior, democracy despising enemy of the people.
Yay 😁 2021 🥳
Tá ótimo
Now is the time to get in the ark of safety which is Jesus Christ! The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus. Cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded, lament and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy into gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of God and he shall lift you up.   The apostles of Jesus Christ preached the way of salvation the day the New Testament began saying “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This promise is to you and to your children and as many as the Lord my God shall call. No man cometh unto the Father but by Jesus Christ and as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and those that are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. Receive the promise of eternal life promised by the Father unto man by his Son, Jesus. Obey the gospel!
Fkn shower of shite.
i luve thes
Why did it take the pandemic for this to happen back in 1999 to celebrate the millennium fireworks were spread up across a 4 mile stretch of the river even though no one was on the banks watching as usual this year it was a better display showcasing other areas of London a bit like Sydney does with the fireworks in the harbour off the bridge and the opera house and the lightshow and drone display was amazing please do something like this again next year
Is this happening
Anyone else get so emotional when Sir David Attenborough started talking
Praise the TicTok nurses Raise a communist/black power fist Welcome in Africa
Whats up with all these quotes?  Excuse my ignorance , but why ?
Yay 2021
Worst year on record 2020
Hi guys can you visit my channel pls
Goodwise done Minitrue! This gives me a doubleplusgood bellyfeel. Those who say that your audiences have gone and aren’t coming back are ungood thoughtcriminals who should be unpersoned soonwise.
I usually never watch firework shows for 10 mins straight but this one was very well prepared and had a great story loved the choreography
" The Fable of the Ducks and the Hens " is a great book and present for your kids to read! My child enjoyed it.
Und in Berlin spielen um 12 die Höhner
Я тоже хочу чтобы в России было так же
OMG I LOVE THIS  YEAR we will never forget about this year without the CRONA
Вауу
What a piece of propaganda.  Might be clever technically. Do they think people still believe this stuff .
Yse
What no no no 2020 won guys I think this will be a good year
Happy 2021
Why did you make it so depressing instead of just a song
the things above the O2 made me WOW
Now THAT’s how you bring in a new year. 🎆🥳
diversity is code for anti-White
This was so beautiful.
I hope 2021 is gonna be better
How can UK justify this kind of expense on a year like this when many are in austerity, NHS is drawing and need more funding, business are struggling to survive and we are entering one of the biggest recession in history. Just to show off!! To show off what?
You guys actually forgot Marcus Rashford.
When it was on 56 it was my birthday yay
What an absolute piece of divisive shite that was.
BLM Burn Loot Murder -This message was brought to you on behalf of CatBoyKami
Love this year its a memory to me
Communism, Marxists crap folk's. BBC report crap folk's. We can make 2021 without BBC and their agenda communism.
Sat here crying my eyes out ahhhh
What’s the first song that they put
I love you Rmg This is the real Jeleah
I was like wow when 2021 came up 😲
Imponente Festejo.Los sobrevivientes del Covid pedimos un minuto de silencio en memoria de las víctimas🙏
And that is why Uk is BREXIT ⭕️BBC 👉  the EU 🇸🇪😈.... 🐇 🕳
Imagine about all the birds that died during that
All lives Matter
Absolutely brilliant show! Until they politicised it with the BLM fist, I turned it off immediately at that point.
By far the best display! So meaningful and well thought off 😍 happy new year everyone!
I Loved it
more like NHS advert than new year celebrations...BBC British bull crap...
Happy New Years
Am I the only one pleased by the absence of Auld Lang Syne because they sing the wrong words every year anyway? Go to any Robert Burns page on the web, you won't find the nonsense line that is "for _the sake of_ Auld Lang syne" anywhere. Wikipedia is probably a good start for the countless buffoons who can't hand a syllable spanning two notes. Lord help them facing a real melisma.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Suddenly I feel an urge to loot a Foot Locker.
Am I the only one who watched with non stop goosebumps?
Not even 10% of burj khalifa
Antifa, BLM, LGBT are all lobbies that are running a new regime based on ideology discriminations. Discrimination is no longer based on race but on ideas and believes, theirs. Government and media  should not support these anarchic rebels. PROTECT FREEDOM OF SPECCH AND INDEPENDENT THINKING OF US ALL. RESPECT FOR OUR ANCESTORS WHO FOUGHT FRO FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY.
lol gaaaaaaay
They actually did the communist black lives matter fist. Disgraceful
BTW, Joe Biden is Not Pres Elect as the BBC lied initially about, since the votes weren't certified yet. Now Dominion Voting Systems Company is in deep legal trouble for voter fraud. Many votes cannot be certified yet because of them, so , technically the USA 🇺🇸 doesnt have a Pres Elect yet, but if you weed outthe fraud , then Pres Trump won by a landslide.  Dominion Voting Systems was used in Venezuela & other corrupt countries too. See see NTD for more investigations, and hearings.
What a waste of money did u get the fireworks from mates m8 or boris
Voting won't remove them.
whole thing is pretty cringe ngl
OMG IT'S BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WISH I WAS LIVING IN TRINIDAD!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi
Reason govt did the fireworks anyhow, was because they knew of the greater backlash since the the known gaslighting on we the people about this flu season is being passed off as covid19 v2. The Asian countries exceeded this with not only fireworks but people in the streets as well as some cities of the USA not controlled by marxist leaning Democrats(aka Demoncrats).
It says live and it says 1 day ago
天空中文字咋弄的？
2021-start a new chapter of our lives
“We knew what must be done and so to help we hid away...except when we protested for drug addicted criminals”
Brilliant
Spectacular
This is amazing. Wish I seen it live. Trust the British to put on an amazing show. 😊
🙏🙏🙂💖2021
So cool 😎!!

Burn. Loot. Murder.
It was so cool
I watched the exact same video on tv
How much did all this cost?????  Anybody not seen the numbers dying of covid in our capital city? Cost??? Last year - £3.4 milliion
Thought there weren't fireworks??
Bye bye 2020 hello 2021
Sad about having the BLM SHIT in the show.
Happy New Year
Ooh goodie, I can't wait to show this to my wife's boyfriend.
Wow 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😂😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Omg
This is beautiful, I'm so happy it's a new year. We made it, you survived 2020. We all became better people, enjoy this year. You will get through it. Best wishes for everyone
The black lives matter fist is literally the same fist in the CCCP flag! They are blasting it in your face!!
*THIS MADE ME CRY*
Huge propaganda stunt.
Do other countries do stuff like this or is just my home country alone
Not one mention of the scientists who have dedicated their lives researching and understanding virology, and every other aspect of biology, such that in crisis like this we have the tools to develop vaccines which will save countless lives. Makes me sick how ungrateful people are for scientists. The scientists are the people you should be dedicating this display to. The scientists who first recognised and understood viruses. The scientists who first developed vaccines. The scientists who have researched and told us everything we know about this virus. The scientists who WE ALL DEPEND ON. NOT ONE MENTION OF THEM. Absolute joke of a display, dedicating a section to rioters who deface status of heroes like churchill but dedicate zero to scientists. The nhs would be nothing without science but they get a shoutout aswell. How do we know climate change is coming? Ah through scientists. Who made this display possible? Oh scientists and engineers? A feller does a few laps of his garden to raise some money and gets a mention. Oxford develop a cheap and efficient working vaccine to end the virus and get completely overlooked. No wonder people are so ignorant today. The NHS are not on the front line. The scientists are. The NHS wont end the pandemic, natural selection will unless scientists put and end to it first. Do i need to drill it in any more? Imagine getting no credit for a funny joke you made, feels bad doesn't it? Well imagine how scientists feel after this joke of a display.   Note: I completely agree with everything mentioned in the display, racism is immoral and shouldn't exist, NHS workers are heroes etc. Just give the credit where its due and show appreciation to those who deserve it the most. The scientists.
Google dancing Israelies
Oh wow it’s so pretty I like it it’s so pretty I never seen that before and I’m so small I like your well well I keep watching them but I don’t know how to do nothing
SPECTACULAR
Beautiful the hope and the word's spell it truly out.. This world and this country can be and will be turned around... No words can say what one horrible year 2020 was... But look on positivity  hope pulling together.. Being stronger caring this virus can be won over.. For man and women kind..  Happy healthy positive new year 2021 lead the way
One can only try to understand an equal, judgement occurs from a pedestal ⭕️

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
New Years Eve fireworks are not meant to be political. How on earth was this allowed. No doubt Sadiq Khan gave his blessing the hypocrite.
If I could rate out of 100 it would be 100
HAPPY NEW YEAR
Happy new year
this was amazing
Proud to be British 🙏
I am not a hater but there are homeless people sat down with no home or food and are do went barmy and mental she cried fireworks should be banned just saying
Super woke fireworks and drone display with "Black Power" racist salute by drones in the air above London ruined what was otherwise a very good display and a technical marvel. Shame.
Yesterday was 2021
A future millionaire will like this comment
Even when we are going through a rough time together we can get through this
Like seriously... that 2021 at 1:59 🔥🔥😲was Ammazzinngggg
What racist shit
第一次得知有伦敦有美丽烟火的时候，我就十分向往它，但是看到UK如此痛苦的时候，我也十分痛苦。 希望无论是UK还是整个EU，可以早日恢复往日的平静。 也希望能够通过翻译软件看我这句话的人，记得带口罩，记得保护自己。因为这样是保护自己的同时也在保护你的家人！
🥳 happy new year 😆
Yuri Bezmenov was correct
Kol Kol Kol
Why with the BLM stuff again.
Let's hope we can all unite in 2021 regardless of creed or colour - Blacks, browns, Chinese, Indians, Muslims etc all joining, you know, normal people to create a world without prejudice or ignorance.
Happy new year from Italy ...the Zombie Land😌
If you think that was cool go watch the Burj Khalifa get lit up in Dubai
So sad I live in America happy new year 🎆
С Новым Годом!!!

I saw this on my TV lastnight
The top of the Shard looks like the top of Sauron's tower from the book Lord of the rings when it turns a  gold colour.
Brilliant display totally ruined by the woke commentary, wasn't needed or asked for, stopped watching after 5 minutes as too much wokefullness , started to feel nauseous so turned off, which was a shame, as the drone display was amazing.. Thanks for ruining the display the BBC.
BLM 🤦‍♂️
This is just amazing. Awesome fireworks with brilliant message. Way better than Dubai’s.
Wow
🧗🏽‍♂️
Wow
Name of songs please 🙏
Wow that made me really emotional. Thank you putting that together. Hope 2021 brings the love and togetherness we all need right now. Much love X
What a show! I hope that the UK people can back to normal life from the pandemic soon in the new year, best wishes from China!

The best one so far
The way they did that with the drones in the sky with the bird is amazing
Is it me or would the drones have been enough?? Leave out the fireworks if you want to save the planet and stop scaring animals half to death! Would also save abit of money too....

Better than in the Netherlands
We are blessed to of made it through this year. Rip to the fallen 🙏
Bright colors don't change the fact that we are trapped in our homes and are reduced to being mere tax cattle.
This is so emotional. Hope this year is a better year all the way. Sending positive vibes for everyone.
I have a feeling that 2021 is going to be even WORSE than 2020 , so .... * runs away *
I saw dis on telly
Milenials at the BBC still pushing a political agenda no-one but radical lefties care about pushed out by BBC studios so its conveniently unaccountable....hopefully in 2021 BBC... you are history
The drone work was fantastic, it s a pity they were promoting the Marxist terror group BLM.
It’s emotional to think that we are alive that we made it threw this year!, remember to thank your family because we made it and thank especially the  doctors stay safe we all hope this virus is over soon! ❤️
excuse me but the fireworks were cancelled .... this is ... fake.   A stunning example of the arrogance of the BBC.  At least SKY News were temporarily honest and showed everything cancelled.  This symbolises the imminent demise of the MSM.
5:44 aw shlt londons about to get sacked?

To the haters take a chill pill
It's like watching the pravda with their old soviet propaganda BS. Money better spent housing and feeding the homeless around there that you have awaken with this pointless fireworks.
Follow my YouTube For good content mainly sneaker related and some other stuff. Im new to this come grow with me! Bless up
The Nightingale Hospitals were a very expensive waste of time and money.  Like Khan's display here.
Oh my God, this comment section is full of ❄️❄️
Is there lots of dead birds on the ground after these fireworks ?
Nice Video. Have a Happy New Year 2021!!! 🎇🎇🎇🎇🎉🎉🎉🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽

Such a great start to increasing world pollution, then again we only have till 2030 to reduce carbon emissions majorly and with this attitude i seriously doubt we'll achieve that.

1984! This was supposed to be a simple celebration of the New Year, not a political advert. The church of woke is OUT OF CONTROL.
WTF?  Apart beautiful light show! Propaganda oozing from the Message is disgusting for conscious people. BLM and Coronavirus theme, shows how deeply our World has fallen. But it is not stupidity of our goverments, organizations, WHO, WEF, FED, left or right wing activists nor politicians.   That is our stupidity as a Society! And 2021, 2022, ... will be even worse, until we Wake UP! Please! Read books, talk with each other honestly! Put off your masks! Not only "Anti-CowID" masks, but most importantly masks , that we were wearing years before plandemy as human beings, enslaved by media, parents, school systems. Put off the masks, which are covering our true human nature: Capability of love, honesty, selfconsciousness, true wisdom which are naturally occouring in abundance at the heart of each human being!  All lives matter! Especially lives without propaganda, social engineering, left or right wing extremism.  Free humanity matter! Where science, free speech, objective journalism, private property, virtues and spiritual values, love and honesty matter! If they are dividing us, it is because we go along with the mainstream narration, injecting not vaccines but only fears!  Fears about kind-of flu virus, fears about opposite sex, fears about presumed racism... But at the same time, secretly, we are unable to see, that with our own hands, while working in corporations (mainly  high-tech sectors), we are developing "solutions", that most often enslaves us more than makes our lives better!  Since the year 2020, it is no longer possible to met strangers, share ideas, confront them together. Our mouths are wide shut!  We can talk using internet, but censorship is getting stronger. Voices of intellectuals which are incompatible with mainstream narration, including google, facebook or twitter agenda are silenced and shamed! This is not the Freedom, we fight and hope to stay everlasting, after cruelty of totalitarian regimes, not that old after all...
Happy new year london
Everything is put towards NHS what about postie's what about teachers they worked there whole way through lockdown some even having 3-4 hour rest after shifts yes the NHS have done amazing job but so have lots of other people
Bringing in the new year with brainwashing propaganda.
They should do light shows on the Shard more often. It looks amazing like something out of a movie
It's like a fortnite event
If I had control of those drones I would make it say 2020pt2
Happy New Years to y’all too and also happy 2021
All this money they put into this could have gone to the NHS and finding a cure for coranavirus.
I am black ✊🏿 ✊🏾 ✊🏽
You can tell me the name of the song from the 2:45 minute
Thank you doctors because you take out the virus
Its a shame it was ruined by blm fist, should have been left out. Why politicise the new years celebrations.
Come on, world! Happy new year!
The only place on earth I want to be right now....

fireworks were a mess but drones were cool, hopefully we'll switch over to just drones in the future
Just wish it could have been enjoyed properly
2:40 - 3:15 my favorite moment like if you also like thet moment
I love those drones making shapes and words behind the fireworks
The sooner we defund BBC the better, just one big push now, corrupt biased fake news reporting has NO PLACE in Brexit Britain...
Why did I cry 😭
Omg so cool
I don't care about fireworks. I'm here because of Sir David Attenborough! One of the greatest human being in Earths history!
Fireworks in 2021 I think it’s better than any years that it had occured. But it’s not so happy as many years before because of tears of Covid-19. I’m so sorry about that.
THERE NOTHING WORSE THAN A WOKE NEW YEAR.  GB IN THE HANDBASKET TO HELL.
just posted a video about sustainable/low waste/eco-friendly resolutions for the new year! go check it out on my channel :)
Next in news: The Big Ben is demolished because of muh racism.

Happy new year 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈
It’s so beautiful. The Chinese people hope that the British people will overcome the epidemic as soon as possible.
Thanks for the UK’s tax I got to see this amazing fireworks for free 😆 This was one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen
Happy New Year!! Let’s have a JUICY 2021.
day of the rope
What's with the dislikes???
Te qijfsha BLM te qijfsha.
another satanic ritual
9 days to build a hospital that wasn't used for a pandemic that never happened Soros funded Demonstrations allowed but real civil disobedience shut down using Po-lice violence. NHS paying £1000 for each sick person sent to a care home to infect others with Flu. New year crowds banned from watching these very fireworks. All these celebrate is Satanic Evil of the state!
Absolutely fantastic good on mr Kahn and those that devised and worked on this.
Who heard the ambulance at last. Guess covid-20 gave an irony to this video.
I still don't get Black lives matter please explain..
Bow down, get fisted.  Stand up, be free.  Tough choice.
Cool
Awesome.
More drones no fireworks, much less pollution.
Can someone please dislike my comment? I want to see if I get a notification.

Let's start the year being cruel to God's creature and expect him to send more deadly viruses to get rid of human monsters on earth. We are too evil 😈 to be on earth. Let's kill all the birds those fly over Britain, violating our (?) air space.
A very happy new year to everyone out there 🥳🎉🎉🎉 may this bring lots of happiness to each and everyone ❤️❤️
🤠super🥇👍London UK🇺🇳
this is why i hear very loud-
Why did they put "Burn Loot Murder" logo in there?   Are they insane??!?!?
Енн наш
Congratulations Sadiq Khan.. you continue to be the worst thing to happen to London.  This steaming shit show was a massive waste of tax payers money if iv ever seen one BOOOOOOOOO XD
I cannot believe that in London the Capital of England they would dare to show a Marxist sign with so much pride. If this continues we will wake in a country of Communism.
White European lives matter. Sadiq Khan must go.
Alm
I gradually came to hate them.
Very good
Wow the bird was so nice I love the nhs
This was a stunning themed fireworks, drone & laser display - very different to the usual display. However, it could have done without the BLM advertisment - we cannot endorse violence, the defacing of our famous British statues or the burning of the Union Jack at the cenotaph. These acts are utterly unacceptable, and those people who do these type of acts have no place in our great country. At the end of the day, all lives matter regardless of the stereotyping - and if you have something to say or to express, do it peacefully and in accordance to our culture & laws.
Absolutely amazing. Thank you NHS, care assistants, social workers, food production, cleaners everyone who is risking their life to help other people in one way or the other.  I see you all❤❤
I have been to the o2 before and it is amazing I have been there 5 times and it is so amazing
You should've filmed in 4k60fps. Come on! It's 2021 already!
What a waste of money
Wowwww
Air pollution
This is so prity
Have you noticed none of the nazi accounts use their real names or photos? It's like they know that when we find out who they are, they're toast.
WOW
The drone was okay and the overall fireworks and music were a bit underwhelming
LITERALLY 1%😇 PEOPLE WHO IS READING THIS MAY YOUR PARENT'S LIVE MORE THEN 100 YEARS😍🙏🏻  AND HAVE HEALTHY LIFE GOD BLESS YOU❤️
Do y’all know how scared dogs get
it shows what NHS have done thogh the year <3
Nhs are becoming corrupt like the government
Wooo, this is beautiful
Just mesmerising. One I would have wanted to see live. Brilliant Just brilliant. X
I didnt know london had swag like  this.🎆🎆🎇
Love u uk
woah
Built nightingale in 9 days and dismantled it in 2 because it wasn’t used! Well done guys
Happy 2021
Disgusting display of virtue signalling, anti British, pro EU propaganda all paid for by the hard up London tax payers to the tune of 1.6 MILLION POUNDS. No wonder the BBC were so keen to cover it. 2021, the year that we finally get rid of this vile organisation by defunding it, can't wait.
Wow cool
I cannot believe this as am just watching this as I missed it on the night as was asleep and I dreamt of an Eagle. Amazing!!!
Happy new year’s ❤️🥰 2021

It says, 'You're on mute, all the mask wearers.'
Blm, gay flags, minorities, depictions of Africa, not a single English flag, no mention the native population and enforcement of propaganda relating to a fabricated "pandemic".  If you are English and reading this, we must take our country back.  Get involved, there's nothing we can't do.
The BBC need to be put in there place, Black power salute!, the PC brigade are out of control. defund the BBC.
Someone tell me what the song with the blue bird flying is called
What even is this comments section? The amount of Fascists and closeted Racists that have infested it is utterly absurd, it’s really sad to witness lol.   Oh well I suppose. Happy New Year everyone

Bye bye 2020
I would love to know how much all this cost!!! Just saying we have more and more people on the streets, we just locked down our entire country again and children are going without meals!!! If the Mayor of London actually gave a sh1t he would be cutting this in half at least and giving that to help the ones who need it. Where is Super Marcus Rashford when you need him ey? He would put a stop to this ha ha ha.   I will not even get started on how this has been yet again politicised. S@ck a D@ck Khan it is time for you to go. You are about as much use chocolate tea pot!

I can’t stop watching this. I was there in 2015/16 and I thought it was perfect. But this year was even better. Thank you BBC. Greetings from Brazil.
Pathetic idiots no wonder the BBC and sadact khan are hated by the MAJORITY of the country, they actually think people will be forced to conform to a racist idiotically movement like bLm, ordinary working class folk have had enough of our war memorials vandalised, our shops looted and police officers being assaulted in the name of this Marxist group of idiots, PS did you not get the MEMO sadact! We the majority don't want any part of the EU, get a grip pls you horrible fascist
Thanks
Happy New Year 2021.
I don't imagine you will dispute the fact that at present the stupid people are in an absolutely overwhelming majority all the world over. Henrik Ibsen
I'm so glad BLM was in there too (as always ) along with the other plausible rest . Didn't it all started from a criminal..?
Love you 😇😇😇😇👏👏
London does the best display every year and this one just hits in the feels! Spectacular! I cant wait to get to a display, honestly surprised I never went when I was stationed in Europe.
I watched this live already
I love everything about this.

Fireworks should be banned. They upset animals and cause them distress.

So much polution. We don't want happiness from polution that will us slowly slowly.

I saw that I'm in central London
I watched Dubai's firework show first and thought it was amazing, blows my mind that humans created a vertical structure so powerful and large and put that sort of technology into it, unreal to me. I got to say though, they gonna have to step their game up because this was MIND BLOWING! This one takes the cake for me 👏👏👏.  If Dubai implemented that drone technology into the Burj Khalifa show, it would be mesmerizing. Imagine some sort of drone show like rings and different designs flying around the Burj. Of course they'd have to do the firework display next to the building but I nothing tops those drones, it would be well worth it. Even have the bottom half of the building display fireworks and the upper half be a drone show, or flip that and have the drones on the bottom and fireworks above. Idk, if they can just do the drone idea it would be serious competition to the London show.
Am I the only one who's crying while watching this? 2020 was really a tough year but life must go on. Hope there will be no more season 2 of that year.
This is the truth must people don't want to hear, that God made us in His own image and satan tempted us and we rebelled against God, for we ALL lie, steal, fornicate, envy, practice homosexuality, curse, hate, are boastful and so many other things that we know are wrong because we have a God given conscience to know right from wrong, still we choose wrong.  God is just to condemned us all because we are transgressors and criminals before Him and He is Judge BUT God loved us so much that He gave His Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ to die on our behalf on the cross and then rose again on the 3rd day to justify us, that anyone who REPENTS and put their Trust in Jesus will no see condemnation but life everlasting!  Repent of your evil ways for we all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and all our righteous works are like filthy rags before Him, and God being merciful towards us sent His Son to save us from our sins.  Repent for the Lord Jesus is coming back to judge the earth for its wickedness.
Hi
Netherlands: nah I’m good
You missed the hammer and sickle drone display
It is no measure of affluence to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society
London is a s#%thole.
The bbc is shit
You've forgotten about the native people of your country and sold them down the drain, the very people whom built your country. Why not leave the UK and go to the 3rd world countries and make them better? I guess they're too far gone to make better and it's easier to destroy your own European countries from the inside.
Happy new year everybody stay safe
That was 1.5 million pounds.
Brexit was the first step now kick all non Europeans out and make Britannia rule again
wow
Beautiful. 💕
5:48 Black lives matter, because the last person who said All lives matter, was killed for the hate speech.

Look at all the snowflake nazis upset by fireworks 😂 😂 😂
Why is there a giant healthbar in the sky
Wow wow wow, beautiful fireworks, happy new year 2021
bs
I’m assuming that physical people were involved in making this all happen. In a tier 4 area. Makes a joke of Covid, especially when it’s referring to it. Was this actually necessary?
George Fentanyl Floyd
The main thing is bye bye the EU. And has much changed for the worse like the remoaners were crying about? No. The one good thing that came from 2020 is the UK reclaiming its sovereignty!
Let's make it 6 million and one !
Burn Loot Murder, nice tribute.
Wow!! The UK knows how to usher in a New Year!!! Incredible!!!
NICE ONE

So incredible well done to the  organization and NHS😷😷😷❤❤
We celebrated 2020 for no reason :p
Hello London happy New yaer. Werry good.

When u think, it all happened quite gradually, so it felt like it wasn't that big this year, just a Pandemic. But this really shows what we have been through. What we are capable of going through! WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER! We are all human. We all deserve Happiness!  Cheers to 2021!

Had to mention the far left organisation BLM didn’t they!
They're beautiful, and all the tributes are so touching, but the money spent on this could have been mine, as care worker,  minimal wage raise.
Couldn't be done better!
Why was it 2 minutes late when I watched it

such a shame that a celebration that's supposed to be for everyone, turned into disgusting political propaganda 🤮 mushy messages for mindless people, Sadiq MUST GO!

who they did this for? for the rich ones? as the people are closed in? what together ? -- what changes?
Happy new year 2021🎇🎇

Beyond the petty squabbling, is the potential for real positive change, finally, if you know history, you know how near impossible that is. Don’t let your fear and prejudice or your upbringing or that unsteady, sickly feeling inside you blind you from the greater truths. Imagine you were born differently, imagine the roll of the dice handed you a less fortunate outcome. Empathy isn’t doom, it is salvation. Our only hope.
It was an amazing display, despite the shitty political inputs.
Brilliant as always London.  I lived in London for 5 years.  Never missed NYEve fireworks.
Imagine time travelling to the midevil ages and doing the bird thing over a battlefield
DONT LIKE IT AT ALL. NOT TO COMPARE OTHER YEARS. NHS BLM????? WHY???? PATHETIC POEM
Now firecrackers won't affect asthma patients, they are bad only on Diwali. World hypocrisy 100.

Yeeet
That’s holy shit - Aristoteles
“white people are a genetic defect of blackness,”  “whiteness is not humanness. In fact, white skin is sub-human.” -Yusra Khogali (leader and one of the founders of BLM)  good to see that they now have the state funding (see 5:40)
It is a good message but rather ruined by the fact we're leaving the eu
🤦🏻‍♂️🖕👎👎
such woke BS! couldnt we just enjoy the fireworks.  BLM is a marxist divisive race bating org. All lives matter ...and we onto u NHS for allowing the gov to lie about the CV!  so glad i missed this on the night, it was depressing enough already.  Sadiq I'm voting for BRian ROSE, say good bye.
omg the nhs did well keep ot up and i love fireworks this makes me so sad and happy
How to turn a firework display into propaganda 🤣
BIRDS LIFE MATTER
I would loved to have been there to see it, although perhaps the money could have been better spent elsewhere!

Não adianta vcs  querer lutar contra o tempo não,  lembram dos boatos  de uma 3° guerra mundial?   Mim diz se tivesse realmente acontecido. Alguém iria empedir das pessoas morrem?  Não e não   Então. Essa doença é visível, elas não veio de animal, pq existe animais faz muito tempo i nunca ela tinha aparecido, não foi de sopa de morcego  pq eles são acostumados há tomar essas sopa e nunca aconteceu isso,  Isso gente assim como um meteoro vem lá das alturas i mata todos ou há maioria, assim também vem lá do alto essa praga,. Então deixa o Corona argir ,. Quem tentar achar sua vida há perderá e quem não se preocupar em encontrar sua vida há não perderá, então vai morrer quem tiver de morre, i não quem os médicos decidirem morrer ou viver,   1° pra vc vê que   Os médicos  não pode decidir quem véi ou quem morre. Então por aí, aí gente tem uma noção que só morre de corona quem realmente pegou o Corona, só escapa do corona, quem não está com o corona

@Western Resurrection: Twist Aristotele's words as you will. First off: Just because these were the fathers of modern thinking, it doesn't mean much of their thinking wasn't backwards and barbaric - these were simply the old days with quite some different prefixes, not always applicable today. Moreover - as your nick implies - we don't need a resurrection. We already have the right ingredients for a proper future here in the west. We just need to apply them properly - as in "no tolerance for barbarism - whichever culture it may arise in. Be it by the immigrants or by us.". You see?
WOW
happy new year 2021

Every year, London does the best display

Well this is what we get when the government legalised military grade propoganda on the masses. A never ending flow of brainwashing NLP propoganda from every damn angle. They think your stupid, try to prove them wrong ya.
i think we need more riots and looting, everyone will die faster that way
Perfect way to end it, sound of sirens
..And goodbye Erope ! Good blees United Kingdom !
All is good but what about the pollution..is it really necessary to have so much fireworks . It's few minutes of exitctment for us but the impact on environment is huge. And it's not just one city the whole world is creating so much pollution just to celebrate  change of year.. do u think its worth damaging the nature like this just to welcome a new year..?
Happy new year
This is so pretty
NLM🤢
Just wanted to wish you all a Happy New Year! I hope 2021 is a great year for many of you and that you achieve all that you set out to do

Donald Trump won the presidential election. The people of America chose Trump. Biden will be court-martialed for crimes against the American people. Biden and his gang rigged the election. People let's support Donald Trump, he really got more votes. than that freak Biden. We go out to protests, to rallies in support of Trump. We will not let the thief Biden become president.
Happy new year 🥳🥳🥳🥳❤️🧡💛💚💜🖤🤍🤎
Woah that’s insane
GEORGE FENTANYL FLOYD
Yuri Bezmenov was right.
This is what happens when you put political statements into an event that should be neutral and for everyone. Instead kahn puts up political symbols and stokes up even more resentment in an already divided and polarised society. Irresponsible and reprehensible, whatever side you're on. If someone as dull as me could see there would be such a backlash to this then surely someone in a position of such authority should know better.
Great display ended with police sirens😂 all the best for 2021 everyone🎉

Keep scrolling for comments full of racism and bigotry! This makes me sad for the future of our country.
I wonder why they didn't bring up the massive genocide happening to South African farmers? Instead they virtue signalled to a manufactured, fake non-issue. Wake up English people, they don't care about you anymore, they want to replace you!!

I personally think the EU colours and the BLM reference were a DISGRACE personally but knowing now who orchestrated it (Sadiq Khan and the BBC) I`m not surprised at all .
What a load of shite
I'm soo glad that 2020 has ended
Beautiful show but it’s a shame how they outline the shape of a bird, when fireworks end up killing thousands of birds the instant the shock makes their hearts burst. Fireworks are very impressive, but at what cost.
Isn't it funny that a news network called the BBC cucks to BLM?
Such Brainwashing! EVERY LIFE MATTERS! What a shit show!

Small hat productions strikes again
This comments section has been brigaded by Nazis. The disproportionate amount of likes for far-right and antisemitic comments are not indicative of their true popularity, but rather, a targeted brigading campaign by alt-right social networks.  Do not be fooled by these sophists.
Be grateful for what the elites have given you here. Now we are no longer allowed to do anything of our own for enjoyment we must learn to soak up these offerings, just like elite sport, and international travel and parties for people that actually matter. Now we are forbidden to meet family or friends or pursue any social activity for fun, experience or art we can only enjoy their spectacle. We are forbidden to go out, to meet, to sing, dance, gather, celebrate so yes be thankful that your masters have given you this display. Do not let it remind you of your old life and everything they took away. Allow their great spectacle to fill your heart with gratitude because there will not be anything else from here in on.

This is the best one yet my mum said it was better than the year 2000 one!
Its a shame, other species had to go through all these, not to mention the volume of harmful gases thrown into the atmosphere, as I can see some confused birds flying away in the mist of the celebration.
Political statement masquerading as fireworks...disgraceful and I voted for Khan and did not vote for Brexit...Let it go mate, we all have other things to be worrying about like jobs and food on the table
But why 720p?!

Happy New Year especially to all the underdogs out there. Those who feel left alone amid all the clamor. Those whose rooms are empty, and are far from the sound and fury outside. Those who are forsaken, omitted, and unloved. Let these mechanical fingers reach you. Not everyone is what they seem. There are millions like you. You are the best guys.
That was literally a brainwashing...
This is a great start to 2021
the blm thing thats offencive to white people it should be alm all lives matter

Different and unique👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This was amazing - made me cry!! ❤❤❤
Happy new year
Bird, captain Moore and turtle Earth- the best. I loved it.
Loved the climate change message at the end just makes me wonder how damage lighting the sky on fire for a nice display does to the environment though, can't be good can it
Great show but it came across like a party political broadcast.
All that was missing was those lights saying 'we hate matt hancock'
This was the worst year  2020 2021 is 👑
Just wow! 👌

When I lived in London we wuz kangz
The only thing I didnt like was the BLM fist, and that's purely because BLMs idea of a peaceful protest does not match with mine. Black lives do matter - but all lives matter... homeless lives matter, exservice people lives matter, people with mental health issues lives matter, people genuinely seeking sanctuary or asylum lives matter, disabled peoples and their carers lives matter... all peoples lives matter in one way or another.

The birds must have been spooked at that time and as there was not many people, all I see here were pigeons, ducks and seagulls!

This gave me goosebumps 😯I am shook
What a nice commie fist at 5:50 Powtórzę jeszcze raz: komuna wyszłana chwilę z Polski (teraz znowu się wpycha) i rozlała się na cały zachód. Ja mam już pomału wywalone na to wszystko , bo ludzie sami tego chcą, więc wyciągam popcorn i zasiadam do oglądania spektaklu pt. Współczesna Rewolucja Czerwonych Puloków. Życzę wszystkim blmowcom żeby spełniły się ich marzenia, a później, gdy będzie już za późno- by otworzyły się ich oczy.

Massive waste of money, the drones are great they grab your attention while hundreds of thousands of pounds of fireworks go off in the background with no one watching.. Polluting the atmosphere.

Amazing
All that money up in smoke....should have been spent on the nhs and the homeless
lol
this made me put a huge smile on my face
Absolutely stunning!!!! Love from Newzeland
Is that a BLM fist or the mark of communism? 🤔
Why does this firework show feels way too political?

I loved that it was so cute I watched it
Bollocks!
Love this years fire works, thought the past years were pretty but forgettable, is is so cool plus as I always worry about the environmental impact but having half the displays done by light is a win in my books 🥰✊🏾🎇🎆
Wow who knew London was so Jewish?
Tutorial complete!
BURN LOOT MURDER. London is such a disgrace.
I was amazed by this, captured 2020 perfectly. Couple days later I checked it out online and see people whinging, unbelievable. The world really is a negative place at the moment, horrid people round every corner. Proud of Londons display for the world to see.
WoW I’m proud to be British
Beautiful 😍 😘 😍
I saw this real life it was sick
I lost interest as soon as they mentioned those Marxist vanderlisers BLM. Screw BLM and their Marxist beliefs. I don't stand with you at all
WISHING YOU A HAPPIEST PROSPEROUS 2021 NEW YEAR AROUND THE WORLD   Fireworks Exploded Over Empty Streets; Muted Celebrations Across Globe Blue and gold fireworks sparked into the skies of the world's largest cities as every year. The lions of London's Trafalgar Square were barricaded off, as Red Square in Moscow and Madrid's Puerta del Sol. Good riddance, 2020, Hello,2021. Some cities planned,like Sydney, to launch fireworks over empty streets. Others, such as London and Singapore,just called their displays off. Paris,Rome and Istanbul were under curfew. The New Year's Eve countdown ball was set to drop on Broadway. But in place of thousands of New Yorkers jammed shoulder to shoulder in Times Square, the audience would be a pre-selected group of nurses,doctors and other key workers,kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens. With more than 1.7 millions people dead and 82 million infected around the globe since last New Year's Eve -- yet hope that vaccines can help tame the pandemic-- the year ended unlike any other in memory.  Angela Merkel,in her 16th New Year's Eve address as German Chancellor,said as much. " Never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy. And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism,looked forward to the new one with so much hope,"  Germany banned the sale of firework  In Australia,where Sydney's fireworks annually serve as the world's first big visual display of the New Year gatherings were banned and internal borders were shut.Most people were barred from Sydney's downtown.Famous nights spots were eerily deserted." What a hell of a year it's been". said Gladys Berrjiklian,premier of New South Wales state,which includes Sydney. "Hopefully the 2021 will be easier on all of us". In South Korea, Seoul cancelled it's New Year's Eve bell ringing ceremony in the Jongno neighbourhood for the first time since the event was first held in 1953,months after the end of the Korean War.  New Zealand held usual New Year's actuvities.Taiwan also hosted it's usual New Year's celebration, a fireworks display by its capital iconic Taipei 101 tower.  Much of Japan welcomed 2021 quietly at home. In Britain under  ever tighter restrictions to fight a more contentious virus variant,official billboards instruct  the people to " see in the New Year safely at home". In France,night curfew was in force. But there were celebrations -- small but with style". " I stuffed myself with foie grass and champagne," a Parisian said. " And stayed at home."

Cringeworthy.  Shame because the display was pretty spectacular. Should have kept it as visual escapism for the dawning of the New Year.  Instead we have propaganda which is wearing very thin.
And what do we have in the us? A stupid ball drop and count down.
That fireworks looks like a fvckn China Virus in Microscope. Oh they might censor those fire works😂. China New Year After Sales: Fireworks & Medical Supplies  💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸 Win Win Cooperation World:💀
Marxist BLM sign and EU colours on bridges, and people say London doesn’t represent the majority lol
London beats Sydney with the visual display definitely.
Beautiful well done, very touching ♥️
The O2 one was the best
Wow amazing Brafo
I like how the lights are reminding us of all the trauma of the year - like a cascade of PTSD triggers - don't worry we'll find one of them to set you off! At least with the bar set so thoroughly low, there is at least a reasonable chance this year will be a better one.
2:57 birds in the sky: 😱
Watch my videos lol I need views hahah n tell me what to post
2020 2 is over 2021
Burn loot murder in the back
Amazzzing..only in London...love from Ph...❤️

ANYONE???? 2022??????
The UK is honestly Amazing
HNYs Shout out your birthday boy it’s love kids daddy’s love.
When I'm hearing the clock bell sound my mind voice telling, WWE Under taker is coming. Are you feel this same thing.
Can we have one thing that doesn't have politics injected into it ffs
DEFUND THE BBC
3:32 Song name is; The Great Replacement , look it up
This is creepy as F!!!!
I cried watching this, because my grandmother, who was from London died this year, not to the virus, but other circumstances. I will always have the highest respect for London.
I absolutely love the drones! I think it won't be long before fireworks are no more at big events! Who's with me (got to be better for our planet) ❤️
"My father was a bus driver" did not feature? How came?
I looked outside my window and thought i was gonna die
Wow the fire work is so great right
BLM - Burn Loot Murder
new york is beautiful
Ōk
some of it is so overdone you cant see it because of the smoke
ya 🥳
I dont know why I’m crying
Reminds me so much of a Jean Michel Jarre concert. Good riddance 2020. Let 2021 be magical.
This video is #4 on trending in the U.S!
songlist?
David Attenborough's life story 😉
This is best in the world for new year...
That was outstanding. I really love the messages. I watched other countries' celebrations and it's just about arrogance that they defeated the virus (cough, cough crowds in China), but this tops them all! Very inspiring, it made me teary eyed! 👏👏👏 -from Southeast Asia, Philippines
A lot of these comments really did not past the vibe check. 2020 f y’all up or something like chill it’s a fireworks show to give motivation for 2021. I quite liked it good job to those who coordinated it and worked on providing this. The LED drones were lit
I love it
(:+
Brilliant! Start 2021 reliving the most shit year for decades.
who cares what this cost.    Real message of hope for the nation and for the world
(:what madiosn
interesting how they put that up when they know people won't be outside. hmm, it's as if they want to make you think normal people are totally fine with that. hmmm
made me proud to be british

I am part of the NHS
Wow marvellous
I love how London has this and in the U.S. we fill one street with 100 idiots wearing planet fitness hats and drop a ball that’s nearly invisible compared to the deathly bright Kia ads that are plastered on digital screens.
At 8:02 I’ve read that a heart within a heart symbol has another meaning.
I like these ir
Nice
Happy New Year 2021
Happy new year..   Wishing you a Happy New Year with the hope that you will have many blessings in the year to come.
What a cool bird in the sky(from jp)

I m going to miss 2020 so it's a goodbye 2020 hello 2021:(
Man happy new years evryone! I hope 2021 goes better do we all agree? :CCCCCC
Woow
We were lied to that this wasn't happening. Many people alone went to bed early so missed it or were woken up with a start! . Criminal waste of money in our times. This is the most demonstrable evidence of the public being lied to and money  being spent and decisions being made without thought to real impact.
Fenatyl - Floyd matters
BLM sign made of drones. How appropriate.
DEFUND BBC
Happy new year 😀😀😀!
Woooooooooowwww!!
Happy new year 🎇. Very nice 👍🙂 Regina from Germany 😉

Bazinga
Happy new year boi
Amazing burn loot murder fireworks
Wtf are people even talking about in this comment section? Seriously you sound so ignorant and bigoted. Why cant you just be open and accepting of others? Why do you always have to be so resistant to common human decency?   The rioters who smashed windows and stole property were terrible people. But we don’t condemn the whole United States of America for the mass murder of Japanese citizens during WWII So why the hell are we lumping all the protesters under the same title of criminals and thugs because of the actions of a few?
This display represents the real UK, not the embarrassing Brexit thugs that have shamed this country in recent years.
wow! happy new year and i hope this year is a better year!
Wow!...... " that was EXCELLENT to each other ! "
١
Fireworks were well timed to the music, my favorite part - 4:13
Wow that was amazing, go London!
It's 2021 ✨💥 coronavirus, it's about time you cleared off!
Wow very nice
😿😿😿😿😿😿😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Excellent.
Umm guys 2021 is going to be a bad news cuz the covid-19 are merging into a mutated covid-19 covid-19 will stay with us for a while 😥😥😥
Bye 2020

Hallo, BBC. Schöne air Show. Danke..
happy happy new year
2:06 *Holy sh- i thought the space and the time were broken and we have to go back to 2020. Thank god*
Disgusting to put Burn Loot Murder (BLM) in the display. How shameful!
Mind blowing! ... NHS, BLM... even Hope and Love, but Nothing about “GOD”... anywhere??!!... I guess we learn nothing in 2020.
5:43    ??????????????
Wow so much political propaganda going in the west right now! Living in 🇭🇷 is not easy but after all these things that happened not just since BLM, i thank i still live in a country without all this disgusting cancer!
When you realize 2016 is five years ago: *"Feel old yet?"*
Way better than Time Squares that’s for sure... there was a massive KIA ad as a countdown.
Bro
The bright lights were so amazing that I now believe the propaganda.
Just in this time government is supposed to exploit the blm propaganda
LOVE YOU FOREVER I WISH I WAS THERE  NOW😉😉😢
This comment section is weird lmaooo
Happy New Year
Such a national shame. It looks really disgusting, you’d better be using israeli flag as your logo🇮🇱
No one  Literally no one British people in every event : Blinding lights by the weekend 😆 Ps : I like the song though !!

tinszelltauntaun X´D   we too ^ ^
Garbage, communist propaganda , control over people, all world bowed to new world order. "United " means sheep who can't think for themselves. Minorities? F..ng terrorists who destroyed the USA this whole year. Shame on all of you supporting this shit.
why did this get so many dislikes?
BLM makes it so hard to like blacks.
When you can't see fireworks on NYE without propaganda
This was so beautiful..the best fireworks I ever seen 😍
I know some one is crying not just me
Am I the only one thinking this but, did this country really need to waste, what probably cost a couple of £mil, while the world is in the situation its in??? No-one could go and watch it anyway, could they. Isn't London in tier 4 and no-ones supposed to be together etc!!! Total waste of money that could of been better spent!!!  This will probably get deleted but hey, there you go.

Voting will not remove them.
I don't know why the comments section on a video showing the NYE London fireworks has been taken over by bigots, I was hoping we would leave the far-right in 2020. Remember Nazis, you were defeated 75 years ago, and you will never prosper, there is no safe space for Jew hate in Britain or anywhere else in the world, spread love in 2021 🇬🇧❤🔯

It’s so ridiculous that BLM is so encouraged they’re practically a terrorise group and it’s nothing to do with black lives at all it’s about hatred for white people and the police force.   It’s an excuse for anarchy and chaos these BLM people want an excuse to rebel and something to fight for. Thy have equal rights what more do you want.
Happy new year to everyone ✨ 2021
All that money, time, and effort just to signal to BLM and minorities in the center of the white world. Prettiest and saddest thing i've ever seen. Indigenous Europeans are going out with a celebration...
The Weeknd?
Have you guys seen the movie: "Europa the last battle" ? You can find it on bitchute. One of my favorites! MUST WATCH! As a new years special
Happy New Year! 🎉
Bruh all that looks amazing, and here in the Netherlands they banned Fireworks :l all of it.
I love the fireworks they are so cool
Wow cool people reading this you should do fire cracker or watch it on TV
Cool
Wow! Propaganda? I'm so sick of this that the whole show doesn't matter anymore.
Well, what a dog's breakfast of garbage that was. Loud bangs, disjointed music, mediocre lasers, propaganda throughout.
So they have David Attenborough talking about we need to save the world etc but they are firing gunpowder and coloured smoke into the air potentially killing wildlife and polluting the air. That makes sense 🙄😂
It’s 2021
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. .............................................

Bro 2020 was just a trailer for 2021
England and London in particular has been invaded and overrun by Non indigenous people at the behest of a dark Globalist Force. This is a celebration of your Dystopian future. God help the English.
Happy new year guys we had it
Awesome display  of light and meaningful  messages of hope and  encouragement for a better 2021. It is US ...you and me that makes better times ahead.....bring in the positive energy of the universe and always listen for the voice of God above all else. Blessed 🕊️🕊️🕊️ New Year everyone 🌍🌟⭐✨🎉🎊💖🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Happy New Years🎊
A friendly reminder that since Queen Victoria the Royal Family traditionally has their sons circumcised by Rabbis!  Shaolom!
omg you can see the same erena that micheal jackson was in for this is it 🥺😔
Thought this was only a light show. Sad to see that fireworks were used too. Has Covid19 taught us nothing? So much pollution added to the atmosphere in just a few minutes to stress our already compromised lungs and give the corona virus an even greater chance to attack our bodies. Not to mention the pollution caused by the fallout from the fireworks into the Thames. When will we become defenders of the earth and put the health of the earth before our fickle need for instant gratification?
I love them
Whats up with those scary church bells at the beginning of the fireworks? Bad sign already?
Can I ask,WHO DISLIKED THIS!?
other countries: we have the best  fireworks  London: hold my tea

Read THE PROTOCOLS
Happy new year london sorry im late
Cuál paiss
How did they do the floating lights for the 2020 and the birb
Glad I’m not a pilot going into London on New Years
Crying my eyes out x
This reminds me of the watch dogs legion Easter egg
This is like Fortnite in real life
The fist of communism rises over the streets of London.
The following are happening in our world and no one is noticing.  1. Armageddon is about 4 action events.     1st horse, Bow = Send it.    2nd horse, Sword = Strike it.    3rd horse, Scales = Split it.    4th horse, Fire = Sear it.     And that ='s Our planet for the past 2 years have averaged 3.23 Rockets a day into space.    That's hundreds of rockets we've "Send"/sent up.    They are weapons designed to stop "Wormwood" in Revelation.    All Telescopes on this planet are pointing in the same direction.    Elon is building underground tunnels in major cities.    "Wormwood" is going to hit the PACIFIC OCEAN. EVACUATE.    All the ELITE TOP COMPANIES ARE EVACUATING THE PACIFIC COASTS...so should YOU!!!  2. "The mark of the beast".       Take 3 6's and place them in a circle and you have a virus warning symbol.     But the Mark is the VACCINE. And because it is a global problem it will demand a global solution.     *The Vaccine will be given Airborne and it will land on your forehead and hands* .     It comes from Chromosome 7 lamb1.     This is the moment where the Bible mentions: You will wish the mountains to fall on you.     And this is the moment where the Bible mentions: The "few" and the "many".     "Few" will die from this Vaccine (millions) and "many" will live (billions).     This vaccine will cure all diseases BUT it will not remove the Pain from any injuries you receive.     This is the moment of the "delusion" mentioned in Revelations.      If you get a cut or any injury, the pain will never go away, they just keep building up.     You will wish the "mountains to fall on you".     666 (six - sick - sicknesses) <->  *Six species of human corona viruses are known* ,      with one species subdivided into two different strains,          making seven strains of human corona viruses altogether.     And you who think the part about the "buying and selling unless you have the mark" is a chip ..that's not right.     You have to understand the person who wrote revelations was seeing specific moments of the future.     When He saw those buying and selling who had the "mark", he was looking at those who were living during the      4 Action Events of Armageddon (see my other video please) and the 7 year reign of the antichrist. Those who are      "born again" have done been raptured away with Jesus. The body of Christ doesn't go thru those events. Only ones alive     are the ones who have LIVED who got the mark. You see, though everyone gets it..not everyone dies from it. Those who did     die are the ones who are "raptured to Jesus". The "mark" only kill the "born again" people of Jesus (see video and comments for      further understanding).    3. The scorpions mentioned in Revelation 9:10.      There are satellites in space called HIVES.    Inside each of them are tiny rockets called BEES.    They are designed to Target all CELL PHONES.    They will be mercy killings by our governments because of the actions above (for 5 Months after the asteroid hits).  Please I'm begging you to listen to what I've said. These events are happening right now. I don't post links no more because YouTube removes them. This is so important that you help  me tell others. I didn't make anything up. If you get a moment come see what else I've discovered on my channel. But I beg you with all of my heart and soul to at least tell someone what you've read. Please at least do that.
I would be delighted if I could see this up in space
not to brag but yesterday a kid was running around with a sparkler lmfao
5:50 oh thank god... i almost regressed back to my evil, prejudiced ways. I dont know what I’d do if i didnt hear “black lives matter” at least 17 times a day to remind me racism’s bad... phew
Next year can we see a North Korea one celebrating there democracy and communiusm
There is nothing to celebrate. Seriously.

These fireworks really take my breath away! -George Fentanyl
Epic just epic
Gotta love BBC!
Supporting Burn Loot Murder is like confirming that you hate your own people.
Okay but let's me real America did Jack shit they atleast touched on important topics
BLINDING LIGHTS
Black Lives Matter. That’s why I want Israel 🇮🇱 to become a Black-Majority country.
The most impressive firework performance I have seen so far. The messages are so touching and meaningful. Thanks UK for this
8:55 All the birds : "RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!"🙈
what a load of shite. total propaganda crap. money wasted on a lie.
Are y’all really complaining about basic human rights and the acknowledgment of oppressed parties. Y’all make me sick.
Bri'ish?!

Incredible. Happy New Year 2021!
What about the kalergi plan?

Shame about the BLM propaganda.
Horrible propaganda which giving feelings of disgust and waste of taxpayers money
Black lives matter🤣
Brilliant, happy new year to everyone, BUT i think the comments section should have been blocked all it has done is to mainly bring out the loonys and fruit cakes and verbal crap,
BLM shit everywhere...
Nice
The amount of pollution in this video is CRAZY lmfao..!

OMG LONDON
Happy New Year London!
Shut the fk up!
A propaganda masterclass. Lies upon lies, and mockery abound.  3:55 The NHS were not overwhelmed. In fact they were so UNDERwhelmed that thousands of staff got laid off and specially built Nightingale hospitals remained unused. Staff were so bored they resorted to TikTok dance videos, possibly the most insensitive thing to do during a so called 'pandemic'. If you clapped for the NHS you were a fool. 5:10 For all you maskers out there. For anyone who values free speech who wants to say what they want on Twitter and Facebook, or gather in a pub to talk with friends. "You're on mute".  5:45 "One voice with one message, BLM". Nope, this is a political movement that doesn't care one iota for black people around the world. It's funded by George Soros and in turn threw money at the Biden campaign to oust Trump. If you don't believe me, check out the 'Expenditures' for ActBlue Charities on the Open Secrets site. 9:22 "Our world is fragile". No it's not. Humanity is. 'Our' world is strong enough to take whatever we throw at it. Humanity is arrogant to even think it can destroy it. Climate change is a massive lie.  Do NOT listen to these satanic liars. They are trying to guilt trip us into giving up our freedoms by staying at home and wearing a mask. They are trying to divide us all with hate campaigns and false news narratives. They are trying to trick us into thinking WE are the problem and that the only solution is to force us into socialism akin to the Chinese model of social credit scores. Stand up to this tyranny. Take off your masks, don't stay at home, hug your loved ones and f*** the new normal.
Listening to the bell sound really comfortable and peacful😊♥️
2020 was depressing...
Incredible. Wonderful.
I'm moving to the UK this is it!!!

SHIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
Left wing bull's shite.... defund the BBC
Happy New year 💕💫💌
Am I the only one watching this continuously? Awesome show, lights, fireworks, and the flying drones. And the words and music... I keep crying for the hope.
2021
wow
What a disgrace.
Woahhh
Ugh I fell asleep on new years eve and no one even woke me up!
Why is the comment section woke and why are they getting deleted
im so happy bc london display continued :)
god damn this comment section is based. Hello pol
Welcoming the new year with no British colours, mostly EU ones, closed fists and a lecture on climate change... No wonder the London mayor is a disgrace. Why have a symbol that is very much against Britain and it's values? That fist symbol generates more hatred than is needed and especially from those who claim it otherwise. Disgraceful and disrespectful Sadiq Khan but not out of character. And as for the BBC, I hope it does this year because the people are sick of the utter crap you put on.
RIP 2020
2020 was ok
Happy New year ❤
Um one question how did you do that 2021 Sign thimg
How did this comment section turn into a cesspool of white nationalists?  (EDIT: In hindsight, my initial use of “fascists” was hyperbolic)
ᴳᴴ•ｊｏｓｕｅ✿❤

HAPPY 2021 GUYS
FROM THE USA HAPPY NEW YEAR ENGLAND AND GOD BLESS!!!
Why are fireworks politicized now ?
Diversity for Israel
What is the name of the song that starts at 7 minutes in? Thanks

Im happy bc it's the new year now this my dreams:D
Using fireworks to spread a divisive, racist and marxist message?! Mixed with fake news segments about the virus hoax?! This is so sick. SHAME ON YOU BBC!!!
Propaganda is getting expensive these days..
Damn, this juice is handrubbing political correct!  More diversity for Israel and less for Eurabia?
Yet another example of why London deserves all the problems it has been struggling with in the recent years.
just wanna wish you all a happy new year.....

Enjoyed the first minute or so. However it quickly became hard to enjoy as it felt like BBC news at 6... Way to kill the mood. Would like to watch something that doesn’t mention Covid this year, if that’s at all possible. Tired of hearing about this “plague” that has a 99% survival rate.
Hand rubbing hoked nose Guys :D
4:04 that point I cried and I'm so happy 😔😭💐
🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
If they really mattered, then why do they keep trying to concince us they do?

The Great Reset New Years Ritual. Just 9more years to the fruition of a full international communist takeover (brought to you by the architects of Marxism). Shalom!
Hey, brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus. I just wanna say Jesus is coming back very very soon. HE'S AT THE DOOR🚪, ready to take his people. I love y'all to tell y'all this and to save y'all from God's wrath that is to come on this earth☄️🔥. Be Prepared now for the door of grace Is closing soon. Don't be like the people in Noah time when he was trying to warn the people about the flood. But all them thought that it wasn't coming and continued to do what they were doing, but when the rain and flood came, it was too late to get on the ark because the door was shut and cannot be open again. I'm not saying this to scare you but for you to be prepared and repent for when Christ Jesus come for His people. Through these past years or centuries we have been telling people Jesus is coming soon and there was still no sign of Him but now is the time to do that. If don't know him now, you have the opportunity now to know him. How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is SHUT. I Love you guys, be blessed, be encouraged, knowing that Jesus loves you and he wants you to be saved, for He is the Good News❤️. Amen. Those who have ears listen, for the time is at hand⏳. P. s. Happy new year, and be blessed in Jesus Christ name.✝️🙌🙏❤️
Didnt watch it on tv, i dont have a tv license 😊
Beautiful country - don’t let anybody tell you otherwise. Love conquers hate!
Why people are celebrating:  2021 beginning: 1% *2020 ending: 99%*
Happpppy NEW Year’s.2021 is here😝😍🥰🤞💋 happy cyr 😭😭💋💋😝😝😉😊😘😍🙏👏👏👏👏
The pyrotechnics is great. Pity the the British cannot apply the same ingenuity to dealing with the pandemic. Sorry for you, guys.
I can't believe that even new years eve is turned into a propaganda fest.
Disgusting 🤢
The fireworks were so loud that my grandpa thought the Germans were back.
It was not part of their blood, It came to them very late, With long arrears to make good, When the Saxon began to hate.  They were not easily moved, They were icy -- willing to wait Till every count should be proved, Ere the Saxon began to hate.  Their voices were even and low. Their eyes were level and straight. There was neither sign nor show When the Saxon began to hate.  It was not preached to the crowd. It was not taught by the state. No man spoke it aloud When the Saxon began to hate.  It was not suddently bred. It will not swiftly abate. Through the chilled years ahead, When Time shall count from the date That the Saxon began to hate.
Cast your burdens upon the lord, he will give you peace. He hear and heal your heart. Follow him before is too late.
LOVE YOURSELF
While my country just put a bunch a unsync fireworks
Does the bbc understand that BLM organisers hate isreal ?
Our patience has its limits.

Wow this was so cooler
Can we have a drone show every year
Love fire work
😍😍😍😍
As sad as this sounds, me watching the London fireworks on tv at the end of the year is a highlight of my year, mum and dad are both dead, I'm on my own. The London fireworks were underwhelming this year, i may as well have loaded up a screensaver on the pc.
This is breathtaking . Magnificent and beautiful
LONDON WON THIS ONE FOR THE NEW YEAR 2021

Drone = Technology + No people  What does this represent?    *Is the government foreshadowing that the future will be technologically advance, but without any living beings?*
I love the song.
Europe for Europeans.
The drones are cool! But why no London Eye?
Did the fireworks happen for nye in real life or is it an edited video? I thought they were not gonna throw them
Hope y'all achieve what ever is on y'all this year 💕
Gee, I thought I was gonna watch fireworks not listen to more agenda, 2.30 sec and Im out..how to depress a new year!
Average BritBongs actual kek
It is not 2021 it's 2020
happy new year <3
I was watching this on my tv
Thank you GB !!!!
Only in 2020 would a nation put so much money, effort and time into putting on such a giant cringefest.
compare this to new yorks 2021 fireworks... it's incredible
Is this CGI?
The comments are really sad. Even for this very spacial event, people can't stop their hate messages and other propaganda... smdh
🔹🔺▪️🌞
If ur not in the uk WHAT ARE YOU DOING????????!!!!
nooooo
Beautiful
this is awful
So inspirational, moving and fitting!  Thank you United Kingdom!  Where the word United actually means something!! From across the pond I salute you!!!
these comments show how racist the uk is and how bad it has become 🤦‍♂️ it’s actually sad—black lives matter ✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿 and thank you to the NHS ❤️
This display was great.   Black Lives Matter ✊
Hermoso precioso me encanta
Happy New Year UK 🇬🇧 from your friends in USA 🇺🇸 😊🥳
Happy new year’s
£1.5 Million of Tax Payers money down the drain, The BLM have a new President namely Sadiq Khan and according to this fiasco they would lead you to believe that the NHS only have Muslim and black people serving the institution. Seems to me the BBC have gone nuts, ITV have gone OTT and the BLM have taken over both broadcasting companies!
wait the fireworks happened?
This is amazing!
Here's an analogy for all of the Redditors:  Imagine if you were forced to think that the "Orcs lives matter" movement is good despite destroying all of Middle Earth, all while Saruman stays in his ethnostate... which you can't have for some reason...
still trending  at #2 this video in Canada 🤯
That is so awesome guys I hope I hope you have a happy 2021 literally so happy I hope you have a happy new year
Wow, so cool! Well done, London! Thank you, from Michigan, USA.
Jaja nose ingles
Love you
Truly beautiful!!
2:52 is that a bird???
Like tomorrowland 😂
1:58 The fireworks begin
Loved it! I'm sure without all the big crowds, they were able to make the display more spectacular! It got me wondering... How do they practise or test the "display?"
Garbage, pure garbage, I don't believe nwenhad Brexit for nothing
0:58 HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021!!
This isn’t about the ‘New Year’ this just seems to be about the NHS.
Guys if u can please checkout my channel, I'd greatly appreciate it.

There was a distinct lack of Read White and Blue colours this year. Liked what they did with the shard and the drones, but the rest was just firing off fireworks with the choreography of a back yard display.

England and the UK are Dying countries,  we have only 40 years left till flatline AT BEST

2020 was hard for everyone. Happy 2021. Hope it will be better for you who is reading this.
The year 2020 will be remembered by the rest of the world as a coronavirus pandemic originating from Wuhan, China and distributed globally. Can it be seen any other way?

This was such a hard year for all of us and love it how they choreographed and captured all the milestones of this year. Brilliant job, Happy new year/tier everyone!
Omggggggggggggggggggggggg ggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
2021🎉🎆🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎉🎁🎉🎉
This made me soooo emotional. Just thinking about Sadiq Khan, BLM and the BBC brought up such emotion.........That emotion was a mix of anger and disappointment that such harmful forces had such prominence in 2020. Here is to the end of all three in 2021.....one can only wish. Happy New Year!
Our ancestors would have turned and left the beaches of Normandy had they known what was on the horizon.
Sod the fireworks....I want more drone displays....that was great to watch

This was great until they ruined it with the blm crap
If you are white and you are reading this I want you to do 2 things: 1) Realise the BBC hates you and your people. 2) Find out who runs the BBC.
Burn Loot Murder!

That is actually very incredible. Great work UK !
I hope George Floyd's ashes were in the fireworks
8:55 YOU SCARED THE BIRBS!
Nice to know we’re getting BLM shoved down our throat, when all they’ve done is cause terror.
how appropriate a shit year ends with a shit firework show
I thought this program contained tits and ass not flashing images?? Wtf
AHHHHHHHHHH YESSSSSSS
In the first age in the first battle when The shadows first lengthened One stood burned by the embers of Armageddon his soul blistered by the fires of hell and tainted by beyond reception he chose the path of perpetual torment ravenous hatred he found no peace with boiling blood he scoured the Emeril planes vengeance against the dark Lords who wronged him he wore the crown of the Night centails and those who tasted the bite of his blade named him…
mmm yes downfall of london

Wow!!!! Cool show but..... that alot of polution
Majority of people are against BLM and how its riots have destroyed homes and businesses and jobs and SUPER SPREAD the virus!!!! Voting won't work!
What a complete waste of money. How about a vote do we spend money on fireworks or the homeless this year
Voting won't remove them my friends.
Very good
A good start but next time do more to celebrate London's diverse community. This was ableist
The home of the ✡️ spider! London, Moscow and Washington
Wow it’s so beautiful 🤩 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow amazing!
Blinding lights but the weekend would literally be the best to play in the city.
They ruined it a bit with the BLM part.
I already know this year going to be crap
BLM? The terrorist organization?
Why wasn't there an Islamic State flag in the fireworks display? Allah is offended
Sneed
Paro
Music sucked.......
What does is say about the UK that there is not a single union jack in that display?
Amazing display as always, even though it’s been such an awful year🇬🇧 Shame on all the Gammons getting upset over some fireworks😂
If a New Year's Eve display is prerecorded and nobody is there to experience it, did it make a sound :)
C00L
Thank you from the USA
Old habbits ? Physical interaction and smiling ?
51 seconds until...until.... 2021  We all did such a great job in this year I’m so proud of myself and everyone else
This was a great show! I heard it was planned by a Stephen Kalergi, if you want to know more google the Kalergi plan!

Hermosooooo!!!!! 😍😍😍 saludos desde Chile happy new year ctm!!!
seeing the Black Lives Matter symbol brought tears to my eyes. well done london. well done.
So they didn’t tell anyone about this then? I can’t be the only one who didn’t know about this shit.
Damn I didn’t know Wembley stadium had a display as well should’ve looked outside the window lol 🤦🏻‍♀️
How can you openly support terrorist organisation like BLM and on new years eve?! Have you got no shame?!
And happy new year’s
BLM ✊🏿
I’m speechless! Didn’t expect such a wonderful celebration. So meaningful, so powerful, so kind! YES, LONDON! YES!!!
This public comment section being allowed to be switched on makes me wonder why the Arabs saved the Western world out of the dark ages.
Happy new year!!! 2021!!!
Happy new year everyone
Alex so cool
It's trending at no. 1 right now!   Jan. 1
These fireworks left me breathless
Wow
5:44 is the moment i switched off...
This was great until the BLM crap. Guess the UK supports violent anarchistic hate groups. Shame. That’s where I stopped watching. Can’t even comment on the rest because I’ve lost interest.

The fireworks were sickening really! I hope you all get what you deserve for deceiving people.
BBC shilling communist propaganda imagine my surprise
I watch times sqaure
I was amazed by hearing Sir David Attenborough on the last part of the show. That particular moment brought tears to me eyes. Hope he will live a lot longer coz his voice and his entirety is such a blessing to the whole humanity. Happy New year brits and to all of you the other human races. Love yall. Keep Safe!
Why put the Burn Loot Murder bs in there?  Stop feeding the idea of blacks being oppressed because they are NOT.
this got me so emotional! the best display i've seen! I wish for health, wealth and peace for ALL of US this New Year 🥰🤩❣🎉❤🙌
432 💜
BLM = Burn Loot Murder! What a shame putting this in! People are free, you never will control us all!
Even new year fireworks are political now
A symbol of dying country and nation.
I played mr beasts intro go loomk at my vids Edit:at the end of the year timed perfectly
No need to turn New Years into a far left political display, disappointing
Excelentes , saludos desde Buenos Aires
I’m happy to be raised in the uk
A big thank you to the NHS. I don't know what I would do without all the tiktok videos of nurses dancing. Oh well its only 19% of our taxes.
♥️♥️♥️☻
Nothing says love and peace like destroying everything you disagree with
This was sick🤯
Welcome to Cuckoldon!
This sounds like the bell of Hope. May god clean this world from Covid and bring happiness and joy back to people’s face. Peace and love.
Happy New Year although apparently it’s gonna be a worse year this year we should be hopeful
AMAZING!
woke trash, your nation is over run by 3rd worlders, you dug your own graves
London: There will be no fireworks for 2021.  Also London: N
Is this Britain??? Surely it isnt Ghana or Somalia? 😄
🤭🤢🤮
What a load of shyte! BBC are just salty at us leaving the EU so they did this 😂😂, ps there's no BLM rats outside of London, The UK hates them with a passion! Good luck London enjoy you're shytehole city
#4 on México trending ✌🏻🇲🇽, good vibes for everyone in the world and happy 2021 🎉
It’s hilarious that people believe that 2021 will be any better (or worse) than 2020 only because it’s a different year. Every day is the same day. People’s perspective is what makes it better or worse.
Wow, trolls and bots are out in force in this comment section!
Finally its over
Anyone be able to tell me how they did the lights in the sky?
In some places, there were no fireworks because they believed it was inappropriate (given that people are dying and all). UK seems to not care even though the situation there isn't great and they were one of the firsts to detect the new strain of the virus. Okay lool
Join Patriotic Alternative if you're sick of being hated for being white.
No star of David, so unprogressive.
My God! This was amazing! London dit it right!! ❤️
Best Fireworks Ever
A new year not in my 2020
Why does everything have to be about politics and war and why is everyone making the BLM fists bad they are just fighting for what is right! Why can’t you just say happy New Years and go along with your day!
Defund the BBC. Britain is a white nation. Racial foreigners will be punished severely

Disgusting misuse of gov funds. How dare London council use taxpayer money to promote their own political beliefs, and to deliberatly hide their plans from the public because they knew the backlash they would receive is just low.
Cool😀😎
2020 was a nightmare for millions  , many lost people they love the most hard to forget the way it happened , hard to not be able to say goodbye to your family parents friends.., just keep your head up wish you great 2021 , don't be afraid of death it's just an other step , make sure to be good , avoid bad things do not hurt others feelings , save humanity as much as you can be good correct true don't let money take over morals , you never know when you gonna shutdown , stay focus just be good  happy  motivated new year

Why is everyone acting like the drones show hasn't been done before in Asian countries ?
Those dots were actually drones witch made a shape all together and they make a coulor, sorry if I spelt it wrong, My mum works as an NHS I loved the person who waved and the black lives matter sign and the bird and the NHS sign... THANK YOU NHS!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️ SAVE ThE TURTLES EVERYONE!!!
Wow the comment section went from pleasant celebration to a a bunch of empty threats.
BLM DESTROY WORLD! WAKE UP PEOPLE
First time feeling so emotional in front of  fireworks😭😭😭😭😭. Happy Healthy 2021 to everyone ❤️❤️❤️
Show some love to all small creators this coming year. There are some super ones out there. I am also a small creator so if you genuinely like my videos subscribe to me but if you don’t then no big deal find another person to subscribe to.
Why Burn Loot Murder?
i was on one of them drones but i suffer from Topographical disorientation so you did not probably see my drone.sorry
This gives me goosebumps so beautiful happy New Year everyone it’s 2021 🥲
FASCISM TODAY!!! FASCISM TOMORROW!!!! FASCISM FOREVER!!!!
What a year
BLM is not what BBC and CNN spoonfeeds you to believe. It is a terrorist organization, slowly normalizing burning building, looting, and killing. This is not something you should just wave around thinking it makes you a good person because you're "supporting black people". You're supporting murderers and criminals. George Floyd died of a fentanyl overdose.
BBC betrays it’s people for a different kind of bbc
Burn the money grabbing "humans" instead of fireworks
A stage where we can watch the Dancing Israelis is what is missing from this.
it is nice
Hay new yeark
Fists are always represent violence. This fireworks where a bad omen for the whole world.
This was Eppppiiiccc! Happy New Year London! 🎉🥂✌️!
omg its the burn loot murder logo!
Comrades! Defund the BBC.
Wow. No red white or blue to be seen. No patriotism, just political bs, virtue signalling and blm? We my friends are doomed...
voting wont remove em
what a waste of money
ABSOLUTE PROPAGANDA! My 6 yo and I switched it off as it was full of MSM BS. What a load of bollocks placing MSM into the NYE fireworks. Despicable, shameful!
Saying BLM is racist towards whites and any other non-black race. Stop embarrassing yourselves.
The same people who cry about the system not being racist turn into racist little shits over a five second message.  Who would've guessed.
Why is there are BLM logo in the fireworks after they tried destroy our cities? BLM are awful, they want to destroy our nations.

funny that UK, which provides oil to the world is asking for change :D u helped destroy the athmosphere  co2, my friends, you are one of them
Funniest thing about racists is that most people (including their own) hate them too 😜
London: wow 🤩  Greta Thunberg: how dare you
What a year, judging from these fireworks, I don't think 2021 is going to be any better.
Love this comedy part: search for “What we do in shadows old lady age difference”

get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know God. repent and trust in God. serve God, you will be rewarded.

Dear commenters.  Please note there is an organised effort of white racist bullies who arrange to negatively flood every effort of reflecting the population.  I am glad we are largely ignoring them and giving credit anyway.  Well done this was a fantastic light show and reflecting the year of protest  Covid and climate change.  Also note that if we take the bait.  The real puppet masters are rubbing their hands because it keeps the focus off them
Maybe next time go full zog and have a massive star of David with the drones
Pleasantly satisfied at all the redpilled comments.
Remember the 6 gorillian
Britain’s racism really shining through in these comments 🤢
Black lives matter.... Psyche! Hhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
The amount of people spazing out over the blm is just *chef's kiss*. Love racist tears x
HAPPY 2021 YEAR!!!  HUMAN, NATURE, TECHNOLOGY = BALANCE!!!  WE OURSELVES ARE THE MASTERS OF OUR HAPPINESS!!!
All lives matter
I am so happy they included a reminder of that drug addicted criminal that robbed a pregnant woman at gunpoint then unfortunately died of a heart attack. Almost brings a tear to my eye.
Fake it was filmed in secret before new years eve and arranged between the mayor and Scotland Yard to push political propergander not to celebrate the launch of 2021, a year to rise up against the dictatorship of government and Sage behaviour scientists using a virus removed from the UK governments list of HCID's highly contagious infectious diseases back in March. Control by fear false figures and misleading stats. The biggest killer in the UK is dementia and loneliness but we have a Covid only health system that has suffered government cuts for years and selling off to private business.
Maybe show some degenerate acting of Britbongs not respecting the covid measures in Spain next year
Ignoring all the pessimists and doomsayers into the comments this was very well done and drones are most likely going to be the future of firework nights and that is going to be great. Happy 2021 everyone, lets make it a great year!
I-
Small HATS, Big PROBLEMS
WOW awesome 💖💖💖💖🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇 drones 👌👌👌
Fireworks in honour of murderers and marauders with IQ 65 (i.e. imbecility), who did not invent neither electricity, nor hospitals, nor universities, nor cars or spaceships. However, they can ably sit on welfare and totter on the streets with obnoxious mottoes. Welfare that is paid from white working people's taxes. Sorry if abusing someone....
LOL ALL THE WHITE SUMPREMIST ARE UPSET THAT UK RECOGNIZES BLACK LIVES MATTER. ITS OK YOU SAY BLACK LIVES MATTER EVERYTIME EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE THEY STILL COME OUT YOUR MOUTH ENJOY 2021
20 Million deaths during the Holodomor.
Happy New Year everyone 😊

Great to see the support for BLM. But even better than that is seeing the racists crying about it in the comments section.. you guys are pathetic.
Wow happy new year 2021

Joshua While we’re supporting villainous organisations we should really add the HYDRA logo though I get that they’re yet to rape rob or kill IRL like BLM activists.
Amazing
Might aswell put a hammer and sickle instead of the fist as they have the same meaning
ONLY WHITE LIVES MATTER
Happy new year everybody
BURN LOOT MURDER
I don't think putting the Burn, Loot, Murder logo in the display was a good idea.  We shouldn't be encouraging gorillas going on rampages and destroying cities.

Shouldn’t this expense been saved and the money directed to the NHS who are at the frontline of this pandemic and this governments debacle mismanagement?
Happy New Year to everyone who sees this! Let’s hope 2021 is a bit better 😂 🥳
Ok with no sound. Laser work is great
BLM has made me more raycis tbh
Look at the statistics of rape and murders and understand who you support.
VOTING WILL NOT REMOVE THEM !

Welcome 2021
REJECT THE MEDIA. BBC ARE THE ENEMIES OF THE BRITISH PEOPLE
Gee, I wonder who could be behind that firework.
Happy Great Reset year everyone :)
Supporting the terrorist organization that has the objective to dismantle the nuclear family and burn loot and murder its repulsive and sickening. Shame on you
To see a tribute to Black Lives Matter was probably the most amazing part of this display. The NHS, Tom Moore, David Attenborough. Absolutely amazing!! Loved it!
Benny Hill is turning around in his grave watching this crap
ONLY WHITE LIVES MATTER
Its disgusting to see propaganda like this in the capital city of great Britain
Surprising how someone can loot raid and steal and be supported that's disappointing
Was enjoying the fireworks until I saw the burn loot murder symbol 🤮
There is no political solution
Next year include representation for all POC (Pedophiles of Color); it's an important issue for Britain!
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN THE SONNENRAD

BLM = Burn Loot Murder
BURN LOOT MURDER
Looking forward to the fireworks that support open borders to 🇮🇱 ❤
Really nice to see Burn Loot Murder being represented in 2020 🤡
The real Londoners are gone, what's left is a degenerate, Marxist foreign film parading themselves as Londoners, rip this once great city
I feel so sorry for England.
DAY OF THE ROPE IS COMING
مبارک
VOTING WILL NOT REMOVE THEM
That was amazing, the drones are far superior to fireworks, must take some serious skill to program all of this, so impressive, let's hope this vaccine makes 2021 a massive improvement to 2020, be safe all.
I wish for a new year full of diversity and more immigration, for a more invlusive non racist , transphobic , homophobic , murderphobic , islamophobic , gorgflyodophobic future.  May the black man teach us and especially white woman how to be more inclusive

Very cringe this year to be honest! But the fireworks and choreography are on point as always.

Defund the BBC. It's only an anti-British, anti-White propaganda machine now.

Burn Loot Murder
Why are you praising criminals?
England is fucked

If you use the BLM fist than you can also use a Swastika. The Swastika represents something thats sadly better than BLm
Black lives matter... Absolutely nothing!
Amazing

Happy New Year 2021
Nice
Once the furlough scheme ends this year, the next firework display for the end of 2021 is going to be a couple of sparklers.
whoever did the camera angle and choreography deserves a shout out and a raise
Nice
*Lord Jesus Christ has come to fulfill the Law & take on the punishment of sin(death) in place of all who have sinned. Believe in Jesus Christ who offers us salvation by our Faith in Him & His sacrifice for us on the cross.* Only through Christs perfect sacrifice is our debt of sin payed in full.  Without the Grace of God we cannot be saved.  🚫No amount of your own good works can save you: in-so the teachings of Allah/Muhammad,Krishna,Buddha,Judaism, new age; cannot save you as these rely on the works of fallen man over God to earn salvation.  All Glory is belonging of God who loves us that He would offer a way of deliverance by His own doing not by what we in sin can offer Him of which is nothing.
BLM , give it a rest ffs !!!!
We survived!
So beautiful
And it’s cool
What song is it the first one
That bird looks so real im kinda jealous  but WOW bye 2020 now 2021 welcome new year everybody

Seriously, I think I can say that this is the best fireworks display the UK has done! Absolutely awesome work you guys!
We London had the best end of 2020 like the turtle and  Eagle were beutifull
COVID : hold my fireworks!
“Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come, and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea in the springs of water.”(Revelation 13:6-7) Confess ur sins and follow Christ bc He died for u and He loves u so much! Satan will try to tell u otherwise but dont listen, call on Jesus and Satan will flee from u. Feel free to ask any questions❤️❤️❤️
💯💯💯💯superb wao impressed
Wow thats beautifully I whant to be there so cool I love 2021 happy new years
Light show - Amazing!   Corona Hunger Games Conditioning - Sad!  Here in USA: out of 7,777,003 Active Cases, 7,748,301 MILD Cases. That's 99.96%.   We have had over 11,602,506 RECOVERIES - these numbers on 28 Dec, so follow the numbers!!  Not to mention they have MIXED in them, Probable-Fabricated Numbers. They literally require NO laboratory confirmation. Check the policy. Since 14 April, USA has included Probable & Presumable Numbers given by Certifiers who are PAID per Case/Death.  CDC Suspended Influenza data this year.  Integrity Matters because ALL Lives Matter!  We all die one day but the amount of shade in management of this virus is criminal.  Thank you Father Adonai for your Vengeance and Recompense for the people in the earth.  Ephesians 6 - People Matter!!  Be blessed in this New Year!! Almighty God has GREAT Plans for His People.. if you do not know Him.. just get to know & Be LOVED by Him!! Ask Him to make himself real to you in the way you can understand - genuinely. The One Who made you, LOVES and ADORES you! He looks forward to communicating with you every Day!  \0/ Cheers!
No reference whatsoever to leaving the EU ?
Aliens rn: 👁👄👁

📸 Love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself.  I am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even though they die Jesus said  HOPE ❤️ Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVREYONE!!!!!!!!
Awww Love it
This brought me to tears oh my
Es igual al qué hizo el presidente que lamentablemente tenemos en Mexico
Who thinks this is the best London's new year celebration
Amen
Keren 👍👍👍
Happy new jahr
Happy new year guys
Probably my favourite nye firework show in London, especially as it was such a nice surprise which utilised buildings right across the city ❤️
WOOOOOWWWWWWWWWW ITTTTTTTTTTT SOOOOOOOOOO PRETTTYYYYYYYYY OMGGGGGGGG OoO
I post the best daily motivation and stocks on my instagram @billionairedosage
Happy new year here is to a 2021 gods speed
9:02  name of music pls
Disgusting anti white hate filled communist imagery on display !  COMMUNISM UNDER BLM IS HERE
Wonderful ...very thoughtful and appropriate .
Omg
If you're reading this, stay strong, healthy, safe, and don't lose hope. Together we got through 2020 and we'll continue to face 2021's challenges with resilience . During these turbulent times there is always hope in the middle of the fear. There are good news: God promises to be with you because he loves you. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16. I just want to let everyone know that Jesus loves you with a passion more than you can imagine. He gave his life so you can be free. In these uncertain times, cast all your burdens on Jesus; for he cares for you. If you've got pain He's a pain taker If you feel lost He's a way maker If you need freedom or saving He's a prison-shaking Savior If you've got chains He's a chain breaker. Its never too late in this life to put your trust in him. Don't let your heart be troubled in these times.  I wish you the best day.
حالة يوم
I love fireworks 🎇

Carry On 2021.
Love how they put David Attenborough’s message at the end about taking better care of our earth after blowing shit tonnes of pollution in the sky. Bravo this is how politics work 👏🏽
Putting the GREAT back in BRITAIN.
Idk how to tell y’all this but you can appreciate the light show without comparing it to nyc lmao
Happy New year 2021
This is diabolical brainwashing at it's finest. people commenting on here are either drunk or completely stupid.
Pile off shit
ABEL!!!!
Und in Deutschland knall Erbsen verbieten alllles klar 😂😂😂
Good Job David !
To the everyone reading this: sending virtual hugs to everyone who needs it! Stay safe and positive in these difficult times❤   My Dream is to hit 4k, im struggling and trying to make my parents
Move on to U.S Inauguration Day
Honestly made me so happy. I know there are so many issues that are unresolved but well done to everyone for making it through this year
Drop a cigarette butt on the street in London and you get a fine and ticket, drop half a ton of fireworks and get a pat on the back by your bent council and corporations joint venture.
I have good news!      We have a savior!Jesus Christ, and he died a brutal death nailed on the cross to pay the price for All of our sins. He rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:4-5) if you believe this ,believe in Jesus Christ and confess Jesus as Lord of ur life ,call upon his name ,and ask to receive his forgiveness for your sins you will be saved.God bless.
Thanks London for putting up such a cheerful show in this tough time! Let's be together, love together, hope together, with the nature. Let the positive and appreciative energy explode and spread to the universe!
Finally... we made it.
Spectacular!
Amazing and beautiful.😘😍🤗😇
W0W from NYC. We got Cyndi Pauper being weird; UK got magic for 2021!
Some 1984 brain washing shit right there!
Happy new better year to all! Superb!
That looks not like new year 2021 but as silvester 1940 during the Blitz.
HAPPY New YEAR EVERYONE!!!!!
HAPPY New YEAR EVERYONE
Booooo
hopefully the BLM BS IS DONE WITH NOW = ALL LIVES MATTER.
me literally crying because I made it to 2021 despite everything🥺
Happy new year 🎆🎊🎈
Happy new year!
Black Lives matter??? What as if Britain has been acting like black lives don't matter all these years? As if we're some kind of racist country??   What a complete fallacy! The BLM message is based on a false premise. Can we have a White lives matter in 2021 because that's just as much a fallacy.
At first I thought this Is  undertakers opening theme
No fireworks this year.  Hmm, fireworks...  Maybe they've been taking lessons from Boris about how to perform a perfect U turn at breakneck speed.  Either that or lessons from him about lying.  Either way, they had a great teacher if they consulted him.  Might as well talk politics, given how political this display was eh!
I loved these and I watched them on tv
5.4.3.2.1
WOOOOOOOO
This is why I'm proud to be from London ❤️
Now I want to go in london cuz of this
Black Lives Matter is shit but all in all cool
Happy new year 🥳 ❤️💃💥🎉
Absolutely beautiful as always Happy New Year cheers to 2021 be safe and god bless ❤️❤️
I love this! So emotional honestly I’m glad we all have eachothers back 😭😍
Wow, what an awesome display but there are tears in my eyes watching this. A bittersweet experience. My book the Gemini Complex will be published in early 2021. It's the first book in a trilogy. Conspiracy buffs will certainly enjoy the read. Happy New Year and may everyone have a healthy happy year.
Omg I was Not Expected Spyro 2's music in there.

For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
I hate fireworks hundreds of animals die from being scared of the noise, not only animals humans oldies think there bombs, and people with leaning difficulty get very stressed

Absolutely beautiful. Happy New year London from Australia. London fireworks 🎇 always number one.
Elisaneth knows how to build a party yeaahhh😄😄😄😄
Nothing British about it, touting anti white BLM nonsense whilst ushering in a new age of technocratic plutocracy.   No old Lang syne, no traditional message just people 'welling up' to the sight of their autonomous replacements whizzing around the sky regurgitating 'progressive' talking points in line with every major bank, corporation and elitist.   Enjoy 2021 sheep, You get what you deserve.
F... Covid and NHS
Happy  new year s day
Check out my music channel out
Beautiful
Even when we are going through a rough time together we can get through this
Rest in peace to all the souls who couldn't experience the hope we all felt last night and the amazing and emotional display. ❤
Me waiting to see Ally Law atop of one of the buildings...
Great drone display. However, I did find it ironic at the end where we hear the voice of Sir David Attenborough briefly talking about climate change just after thousands of fireworks had covered the sky in smoke. Not a good start I guess.
This made me cry. Lord God heal the world. Heal the mind of human being.
hi BBC
Happy new year everyone I hope you enjoy the new year
Rip to those who didn’t make it
Yes London !
We aint get this for our new year
The absolute best New Years firework display so far 100%

Also that bird is a nightingale
What a great way to say goodbye to 2020! I love this eco friendly, drone technology to display new year light show. I’m a proud Londoner and i love how UK government, NHS and front line workers are doing everything possible to keep people safe and fighting this Corona virus with so much care and dignity. Praying and hoping for the best with start of a new year.🙏
In the beghning we thought 2020 would be fun but we never knew we would want it to pass by so badly
This was the best fireworks display ever ❤❤❤❤
I died after this its ju-just so amamzing i wish i could live in landen im proud:)
I liked the drones and the Shard, but the fireworks from the London Eye were better imo
Happy new year! ↕️
Does anyone remember in 2019 all the '2020 vision' jokes? Just me? If only we knew eh
It's making me cry I miss my granny and grundpa in England
Well done
Of course they include BLM like wtf it just ruins it
Happy New Years!!! I got fucked up for new years. I made a 45 minute video on my channel, and it's just me getting fucked up and shooting a shotgun because we didn't have fireworks😂.
Thank you nhs everything that you did to help save the world
Mr.Beasts rewind should be here
❤ its 2021 leave all the toxicness behind may god be with you all
Reply if you are racist       I think there is a bot..
They are literally honoring the NHS their Health Care System while people in America still dont believe in universal healthcare... Respect for the UK, and honestly, every other country which honors their universal healthcare
Apple murió2021
Anyone spot the communist fist symbol?? They like to show you what there plan is
I wish my granda was here to come in to 2021 with me 😔
❤👍👍🙏
Can’t believe it 2021
omg
I Hope 2021 will be better than 2020
2020: *Ends* 2021: *We don't do that here.*
The gamy zoo thirdly disapprove because gear bilaterally satisfy save a secretive men. big, therapeutic chronometer
all oohs and ahhs
I thought they weren’t gonna do any this year???
This really touched me. I'm very supportive of BLM and am very grateful to those who came up with this. Thankyou again.
What was the song
I wonder how much this costed?!
Not for you BBC your going to jail mwahahaha.
The clouds and fog definitely added to this show. So amazing!
Propaganda!
Yea the united state  lost this year😭😭 talking sb new york naww y'all clearly won😭😭😭
Shout out and my respect goes to all of the UNPAID caregivers! Those who do good deeds in secret! The real unsung heroes are the ones who don’t wanna play hero, take a wage, or be publically praised for any good they do. May god reward those ones!
Terrible
simply 😱😱😱😱😱amazing !!!!!! happy 2021
I have to go to school because my mom and dad are key works I will have 1 person with me in class happy new year and I have a lot of fun hope its a good year ☺️☺️☺️ I'm so scared I'm 8
Fireworks harm the air we breath...
This was wonderful, i just thought it would be a laser show so the fireworks were a great surprise!!
Fantastico
Dear whoever is reading this, you are beautiful and loved. Jesus loves you so much and is there for you. Any thing you have done he forgives. He is there with you. You don’t have to live in fear, for Jesus is right by you taking care of everything. All you have to do is believe. Pray and read his word to get closer to him. Whoever you are, you are worthy ✝️💕
who else passed out on new years ?
👍2021
Thank you NHS!!!! Love you
That is cool
Amazing can’t believe 2020 over what a year that I’ll never forget it’ll go down in history x Hope your all safe
Wow, can you say "political messaging"? Must suck to live in a country where telling a joke about any of those mentioned topics can have you locked up.
Why isnt mr beasts rewind on trending yet
2020 has been a horrible year and 2021 might be the same but this event was amazing🥺🥰 just hope 2021 might improve
0:51
9:05 Is it just me or did they sample a bit of the Autumn Plains theme from Spyro 2 for part of the background music?
Can’t you just let people celebrate a new year and let the last year’s death and destruction stay out of it. We don’t have to let this virus take over our world and change it forever. You all (USA included ) make us sick because you’re bringing doom and gloom. BLM? Really!!!  The Marxist revolution, here we go
6:26  I went there before and I’m near it! The place is called  Wembely
happy new years
Can you pleeeeease make it 1080p or higher next year? 🙏
So cool
Happy new year everybody
Why does anyone still promote the BLM we all know their intentions are sinister and I doubt they have made a bit of difference to ordinary non white peoples lives. This programme was for entertainment not the place for virtue signalling.
Wow
What was the last song/melody it almost made me cry for some reason
Imagine how much air pollution would have increased
Happy new year 2021
How is this trending and not beast rewind?
🤩 pretty
I miss 2020
Goverment : there won't be a celebration this year,  it's a tier 4 lockdown  People : ok we're staying home then :( Goverment : is everyone home ? ok great let's party :D
Love you all.  Stay Strong in 2021. STAY together..
BLM shite
Cringe....
Thank you NHS!!!! And HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!
America can learn a lot from UK, Australia and Dubai. But i guess they are so satisfied with their stupid ball drop. lol
Absolutely magnificent!  Is that Sir David?!?  :)
9:28 That is David Attenborough.
Jesus! More BLM, black power propaganda. Swear I heard that bkaxk supremacist, Anthony Joshua  on it too🤦‍♂️
*YOU'RE ON MUTE!* - Referring to independent thinkers.
Oh my God I can’t believe it’s the new year ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Is 2021 I’ve been waiting for this for Years
I love the nightingale bird
Wow 😲 love you and thank you 🙏
George Soros funds BLM.

Btw this happy new years celebration was very ecstatic and so delightful to watch, to those out there i hope your doing well and i also hope nothing bad happens like what happened in 2020. HAPPY NEW YEARS !!!!
Happy new year let’s pray for a better year of positivity and we can beat this pandemic before the end of the year
Waow looks so amazing
Are they celebrating the new UK variant?
Spongebob shouting ‘I’m ready’ at 6.57 lmao
it was amazing.
I know I’m late but Happy New Year 2021! 💯
Where is sharkbl0x at? 🙁😔
BLM!!!!!!! Thank you London
I'm glad my grandma sent me this. This is gorgeous! and restores my faith in humanity. I still can't believe I was in London last year. I went up the shard and was thinking about going on Tower Bridge.
Amazing so many inspiring messages LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 BLM Climate Change NHS and more
Could have spent all that firework money on the NHS! BLOODY JOKE
Happy New 2021 😘😊😍
I wonder how many birds were blown out of the sky
Absolutely no need for the BLM logo to be in there. Yet again pushing politics into a celebration that has nothing to do with politics. Then again what can you expect from these organisations
political fireworks
The only BBC video I liked this year.
Woke garbage bullshittery from the BBC and London mayor we deserve better than this... we pay for better than this!
nobody: nobody at all:  me: crying at fireworks
Красиво!
next nye end of fireworks and it should be full on drones
Why did sky news report there were no displays this morning then?
I was born on EXACTLY on new years Eve 😊 so special day for me oof I mean evening!  Fun fact: when fireworks 🎆 explode the let out cloudy stuff so that night must have been really foggy and cloudy up their  Edit 2: my sister goes to university in London and she phoned In the morning and she was drunk but she said she had a massive headache but I can't wait to experience it my self next year yay! (2022 by the way)
Drones were awesome
Happy New Year!
Happy   new year to the world
„Marek.wrs“ on Spotify = Best EDM Festival Songs
The one person with epilepsy driving by in their car:
Sorry but many of the hands helping us through this storm were white too! I find it racist that white people who have put their lives on the line along with every other race were left out of this tribute.  You want to shout about equality and how you want everyone one to be treated equally... you have just totally screwed up.  This has stuck the middle finger up at all the white doctors, nurses, care givers, volunteers, and key workers that have fought hard this year alongside black and ethnic minority groups to keep everything going. I just hope you don't need help from any of these white "helpers" because they might just feel like it's not worth their time anymore. This was how to divide the nation that needs to come together. You should have kept race out of it. Dubai had a tribute for solidarity this year and thanked all key workers. You've only thanked a selection.
This is cool and all but don't let this distract you from the fact that Geico can save you 15% or more on car insurance.
the money would have been better spent helping the homeless
Um, did they really show Earth on a turtle? 🌍 🐢😂
Lmao shit's 720p in 2021
Great Britain 🇬🇧 is an amazing country
Don’t worry guys...        *They’re just the levels of the year appearing and the bosses too each month*
Wait... Is this real?!?
Total disaster ...goodbye BBC
what about food shopping that’s also helping us
Sorry - lost me at 5:28 when we got, and I quote,  'so many of the nurses and doctors and consultants as well as cleaners the helping hands guiding us through this storm are black, asian, minority ethic....'  The BBC did NOT accidentally forget to mention white majority ethnic  5:47 when BLM was mentioned - that was when I turned off.  This is a time of celebration of the New Year, dammit, but turned out to be yet another event hijacked for virtue signalling, implementing the BBC's very poor diversity and respect strategy document' which is very lacking towards the Caucasian family around the world.
More politically motivated display of bunkum
hey nhs happy new year thanks for all the hard work
Absolutely amazing! 👏❤️
BLM LMFAOOOOOOOO
RIP to all those who couldn’t see this amazing masterpiece may you rest easy may you never be forgotten. RIP Grandad have a cold beer ready for me for when I see you again ❤️

This is the YouTube rewind of 2020.
Yeah, let's celebrate the Klan with a Tan. Terrorists!
All life matters for crying out loud. Sickening propaganda. How this gets any likes I dont get it.
Virus go away please
Beautiful, except for the black power symbol/Marxist organisation support. 😥
WOW THATS SO COOLL
Jackpot 🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🙏🙏🙏2021 Anew year a good life praying
Better than last years fireworks for sure
“Your on mute!”- quote of 2020

The age of aquarius is upon us
Song??
Вас
Little confusing to me
I will miss 2020 😭😭😭😭😥😥😢
Why make it political? Oh yeah of course, Khan was involved as were the BBC. We all know they were anti Brexit and what has BLM have to do with New Years Eve. Can't we have or enjoy anything without it being POLITICAL? Absolute joke and disgrace.
Bay Bay Say
Loved it thanks BBC
I don't get why people are impressed by this.lots of countries can do this. Also at the end when David Attenborough was talking about change, I assume it was about climate change ....fireworks..really...for around 10 minutes...
No way I missed it
Where did they practise for this before D Day? Clearly not in the same place since they told everyone they won't have fireworks this year.
They have free health care huh, I'm ACTUALLY jealous
They lost me at the blm fist thing
i cryed
May the new year be filled with brightness and hope so that darkness and sadness stay away from you. Happy New Year!  Wishing you 12 months of success, 52 weeks of laughter, 365 days of fun, 8,760 hours of joy, 525,600 minutes of good luck, and 31,536,000 seconds of happiness.  and I create this gaming channel (HEART  FF) on Happy New Year 2021 Wish me for success on YouTube😍😍
I’ve been looking forward to this year since I was like 8. It’s the year I turn 13
What happen in 2020: Covid  Rabbit disease supposably worse then covid  WW3 nearly happening with India and China  Murder wasp in the US  The riots   Explosion happening in countries causing casualties  Personal family drama.   Let’s all just try to forget 2020 and make 2021 better for gods sake!
HAPPY NEW YEAR ALL 🙏🙏🙏 ❤️❤️
"We have no money we need to make cuts to important services'  "Save the planet, turn off lights and use your car less"   New year's comes and we blow up a ton of chemicals in the air basically burning bank notes that we supposedly don't have. What a crock of shit!
Now this is how you do new years eve take note NYC 🗽!!!
Their whole country is in the same time zone huh? Cant say I'm not jealous
London has one of the BEST New Year Celebration around the world !! 🙌
Aqui esta el comentario en español que estabas buscando
What a load of shit
ruined it at 5:45
Happy corona year!
This is how you open the New Year! Happy New Year!!
How many million quid did this shite  take to make?
Anyone else feel like they have woken up in communist China? How can you make firework political? Simply ask the BBCrap house and the United Kingdom of sell out!!!
Excellently done anyway.!
Better than Times Square. Nothing but empty echoes. Seemed so off.
Que lindooo
Shut down the BBC! Not worth the license fee even if it was for free!
Beware:  Rev 13:14-18   Rev 14:9-12  Rev 16:2  and Rev 9:6   coming soon..😭🌎
I can ALREADY tell this is gonna be a shitty year.
May the new year be filled with brightness and hope so that darkness and sadness stay away from you. Happy New Year!  Wishing you 12 months of success, 52 weeks of laughter, 365 days of fun, 8,760 hours of joy, 525,600 minutes of good luck, and 31,536,000 seconds of happiness.
Congrats to the people who survived this year
BBC raising it's image,not bad at all. Good sentiments and thoughts all around
Impressive and well thought out, but... how much did it cost and who picked up the bill?
This is amazing ❤️🧡💛💚💙
Big shout out to all the Cleaners , Bin men/women all the sweepers. To all of you a big thank you !! Without you we'd be choking on our own mess .  🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇🎇🎆🎇🎆🎇 Some fireworks for you. Big respect xx❤️❤️❤️
Dang, that was a tough year. It’s finally past, FINALLY. The virus is so bad. The year WAS so bad. It’s over now. Hopefully we can all agree that 2020 was such a terrible year.
Thank you very, very much NHS you saved many lives, but not all you have made a huuuuuuuuuuuge difference in ratings of death thank you 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈👋👋👋👋👋🤗🤗🤗😉😉😉😜😜😜😝😝😝🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳😁😁😁😁 we will all get through it together🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈

...will file this under, "People Are Starving."
I’m so proud to be British
Amazing
Dude my respect for London:📈📈📈📈📈
I wish there would've been a 75 for VE day
Who's here in 2021?
Sheer brilliance
What the he## is that shi# @ 5:49 ????  Excuse me - this is 'all lives matter across the world'! we are one 1. Why has that symbol of racism appeared? or is it a Power to the People sign?  BBC is not a friend of Power to the People - they give out biased news. BBC: We not with you any more and that decision proves how right we were "BAN THE BBC". Wish i had not clicked here - BBC is creating hatred. I can feel it.  And I am not racists (i'd be dumb to say that since i'm 'a bit' coloured) but defo anti BBC once more. Disgrace to show 'NHS thanks' and then go all political with a black lives matter group symbol, those protestors are not even dark like me, they all looked like brits when i last saw them protesting. Makes me sick.  Subscribe here for the BBC ? NEVER.  Please dont send comments to myself - i only done a search to see fire works around the world and did not realise at 1st that this was a BBC channel. Chat between yourselves thanks. but keep it friendly folks.

how is this not in 4k in 2021
Wow that’s beautiful
What a complete waste of tax payers money. The inept, now caretaker mayor of London, ghengis Khan has absolutely ruined London.  Once again supporting a violent political group,. People should read the piece the telegraph done on Khan last week. Awarding his family and friends contracts up to £500 million without going through the official tendering process, which allow all companies to bid for contracts. He is bent as a nine Bob note.   He needs to go now.   The BBC are just  a joke and are so one sided it’s unbelievable.
people were happy to be going into 2020, not knowing about the things that were going to happen then covid-19 starts and we all think I will be ok, but no it's not. Global pandemic stay at home wear masks when you go out ..... Ok, it can't get any worse, oh but it did now it's 2021 now and there is still a pandemic.
People including chikdren  doing without food and shelter in 2021 Britain whats to celebrate
Bellisimo
That was so beautiful. Thank you so much. We can make it through this 🌎🌍🌏❤
Muito bunito nunca vei nã minha vida
The Chinese firework inventor just came to life to watch this
Shame about the subversive undertones though !   🇬🇧 There should of been Union Flag lit up !  🇬🇧 ( although it’s understandable if BBC was involved in the production that that is the case ) 🤬
Wow...This year is beautiful then last year . I love it
yes good spongebob

Sorry folks, for me a few old sparklers and rockets would be more interesting with proper people enjoying the togetherness. Sick of all this political excellence. Big tech wins again. Faceless and becoming boring.

After a very sad...frustrating...and disruptive year in many ways,this was not expected...no traditional yearly fireworks on new years eve...in my opinion no one wants to remember a year that will never be forgot and will go down in history...but a massive thank you to bbc and london for taking the time to prepare and put together in my opinion the most beautifull video and message...makes me very proud...thank you bbc and happy new year...elaine uk.
I choked with tears when David Attenborough spoke, excellent display in London, it made me proud 🥲, we need to change our world for the better, peace, love, compassion and hope to all for 2021. HAPPY NEW YEAR! 🙏🏻🙏🏻💫👍🏼👍🏼👏👏

Friday, Jan. 1, 2021 A doctor tests a madman to assess his recovery. He asks why the caregivers are wearing masks. The patient answers: "They wear the mask to keep flies out of their mouths."
New Year’s Eve fireworks used by the BBC and Sadik Khan to promote propaganda!! BLM a Marxist political party and any other political agenda they had, A disgusting way to end 2020...
🤩🤩🤩. My dream to go to London one day, what an amazing show!
😃
👍🙏😉
happy new year 2021
Ainda assim, o réveillon de Dubai foi imbatível!!!!
This never ceases to amaze me, they’ve really outdone themselves and they deffo kept that quiet!
Please make a documentary on how they did this , its amazing . We beat the world at this
Happy New year
Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Invite the Holy Spirit into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏💐💝😀
Ok...I Live in NYC and I must say don't ever come to NY for new years GO TO LONDON!!! its so depressing that NY can't do a display like London...so sad anyway LONDON YOU KILLED IT!!!! wonderful display

Happy New Year everyone🌻🌻🌻🌴

Stunning & brilliant & hopefully a better year🙏
With all the strobe lights it was like cyberpunk 2077 without the glitches.
ONG !!!!!!!!!!!!!
HNY❤️❤️
Listen to this, the most important thing you'll ever read.  If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)?  According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality, rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, then antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead, and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace! (NOT BY WORKS)
Sadiq Kahn promoting the Marxist anti capitalist political group BLM using tax payers money, what a joke.
THIS IS AMAZING NO WONDER IS #1 ON TRENDING AND MORGZ IS LUCKY HE LIVES THERE
An absolute fitting tribute to the NHS & all front line workers. Kudos to SIR TOM & THE MARVELLOUS SIR DAVID ATTENBOROUGH. The drones & Messages were sensational. Love Love from Australia 🇦🇺🇦🇺 To my original homeland of the UK 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧💚💚💙💙💖💖❤❤💜💜💛💛🎆✨🚑🚒🚔🌹🌹⚘⚘2.1.2021.

This was absolutely amazing 👏 😍
Big Ben's Bell Ding doesn't sound the same 🥺
Wow !! Just wow !!
People commenting about political 'wokewashing', getting all upset over one symbol showed in a display and completely ignoring the rest of the beautiful choreography with the drones and fireworks. Just goes to show how snowflakey people are
Wow❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Smfh i didnt go because i thought it wasn't on this year...
A great opportunity for them to keep training on the new world order aint it 🙄 new normal can bugger off
This display of drones is amazing. I love Alica Keys Empire State of Mind Solo about New York but not on New Years Eve in England. You are complete idiots. There is 197 countries in the world not just America.
I watched until the marxist BLM crap came on then I switched off... Wtf!!!
Happy new year’s ❤️
You had me right up to the point you put that Racist BLM crap on screen.
Wish we all have a good time for 2021

Of course they said there will be no fireworks because they know people would come together in one place without masks during a pandemic just to see fireworks 🙄
5:13 phrase of the year
I SAW A BUS
Shame they ruined it pushing their marxist lefty agenda typical of the british brainwashing corporation
i’m crying literally
What’s the music at 5:20 ?
Happy new year
✊✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿🦠🚫❤️
Very PC....mentioning BLM.....few digs at European union and Brexit.....typical left wing BBC
For people who think the UK is bad:              *SUCK IT!!*
Почему-то в моей вкладке В ТРЕНДЕ, нет ни одного российского ролика
More about the bird flapping in the sky please... Drones?
Wow. .. ... .....incredible.  Those must have been drones.  Blownnnnn
So cooll
f**k BLM and antifa.
Why only 720p ?????!!!!!
london: there will be no fireworks for 2021, it’s canceled.  also london: haha sike
I actually stayed up until 12:00 I watched the hole thing and my sister stands in the middle of the room recording it  happy new year 😘🎉🎊
Omg why wasn't all this on TV live. They was nothing at all on only shite. This would of been great for people like meself and partner watching on tv
Too much politics in it. it looks like a farewell to 2020 than a welcome to 2021. Unnecessary symbols disguised as human rights.
AMAZING this made me so proud to be British love to everyone hope 2021 brings many a beautiful life may your dreams come true stay safe love be kind no more hate is my one dream .
Sub to me please! It would make this year truly special to me!
This was such an amazing display, made me emotional and also so proud to be British where we have the NHS. The people who complained can honestly piss off. This was more than just fireworks, it summed up our year in a beautiful piece of art  🙌🏼👌🏼💖  Happy new year everyone!
Trés Jolie. Meilleures Vœux pour tout le monde

Happy New year to everyone all over the World. Isn't God good to us.2021. What a Mighty God we served. I wish everyone a Bless and prosperous new year with good Health and strength and Daily Bread,Many thank for Sharing those fireworks from London.

Happy New Year
Defund the BBC
hhhhhhh
That was so freaking cool!!
Goodbye 2020 you sucked
Dana Tom kEEdezia
I like the part about the NHS. NHS YOU ROCK!
Not even Time Square could compete with this. Way to go 🇬🇧👏👏👏!!
Bless you BBC!!  This so made me cry happy/sad tears.   This was like an amazing episode of Dr. Who. 😆  Looking forward to the new episode tonite.
i just came to watch fireworks and these mofos talking about convid 19 and minorities  I hate 2021 already
All that money up in smoke well London's homeless had a good view
Loved the idea of the lights- fireworks can be so polluting  Maybe lights can be the new future 🤔🤔
Are the holograms really real or are they argumented reality?  They look truly amazing and breath taking
Happy 2021
Could have spent the 1.5 million on homing some of our  homeless veterans instead of this left wing BLM shite
Disgusting virtue signalling mind control for the sheeple, Marxism is cool now then?
cool
The fact that I’m watching this video from a channel named BBC
I guess fireworks is only allowed if it shows propaganda.
welcome to another episode of why England is better then the whole USA! Featuring Donald Trump!
Tom Walker should be able to “Leave a Light On” for a long, long time after landing this song placement...
20 20 for black lives matter well done you lot hopefully the police/cops treat you equal. Now let's do the same in all the other countries and then maybe we can stop putting colour in the name/title of protests and awards and all be qual for 2023🙏👍
I Wish you all Good New Year. A New Age is come The ⭐Alexandrian ⭐ Age
I was there I was  in one of those buildings
0:57 2:43 3:49 4:27 5:06 (just to save myself time scroll onto the next comment)
Not bad. Apart from NHS and BLM element.
Happy 2021 whoever see thisss
This makes me proud to be from britain well done london this is definitely the best display for 2021
I have to say I preferred this to the normal London fireworks display.  Because they didn’t have to cater for an audience they were able to use other buildings not normally in shot because television would bring it all together.  This was brilliant.
They should play Hells Bells after the bells ring next time.
London: **fireworks and drones** Times Square: Kia ad
Well I think its disgusting even mentioning the BLM, they broke the law, they spread Covid19, they are the reason for so much damage, violence and death threats. It totally ruined the display, Happy and Healthy new year everyone! Maybe the BLM will offer to contribute toward the display???
Was incredibly drunk by midnight so having to rewatch now... Class! Well done to all involved.
8:48 London’s burning, London’s burning, FIRE FIRE
Just Fucked the environment with those FIRE WORKS.   well done👍🏼
new years is a stupid celebration.. changes nothing or anything... just a waste
Boring and cheesy
Well done darlings 💥💥💥🎇🎇🎇
It would be so funny if 2021 is worse than 2020 lol, especially if WWIII happens.
Wow, beautiful work of art! ❤️
Subscribe to me
Alhamdullilah ❤️❤️
When I was watching at 2:04 I got so confused I thought we got thrown back into 2020 cuz the music sounds like the rewinding tape

WAO WAO WAO , EL MEJOR DESPLIEGUE DE LUCES Y MENSAJES POSITIVOS QUE HE VISTO DE TODA MI VIDA.  BRUTAL, LOS FELICITO.
so incredible.... awesome light display and choice words and music excellent!!!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM THE USA!!!!!
Trust Khan to politicise it. Nasty little man
All that state sponsored political messaging was sickening. What happened to a plain fireworks show without propaganda?
The best city ❤️
Beautiful fireworks better than burj khalifa
Defund the woke BBC media scum.
Times Square has been really quiet since this video dropped.
London is ready to lead..
Nhs? Really, What about all the keyworkers out there. Police, army, private health care workers and many more.
2:40 hit hard
Can anyone name all the songs used here?? Plz
Best propaganda video ever.
Boomers on daily mail are complaining about the BLM message. Shame on them!
Happy New Year my ass! Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights! There is no such thing as "new normality"  eexcept in Orwell´s Newspeak. WAKE UP!!!
Thanks so much it was so beautiful also safety thank you so much London will never give up
The bird was so heart touching 🥺❤️ definitely the best out of the world
London
WOW HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021👍
Woow thank you 😊 💖

Just breathtaking
I love this
It wasn't television as I was watching bbc channel. But it looks great, thanks YouTube 😅
0:59 Undertaker entry xD
STRAORDINARIO  !  INEGUAGLIABILE  !    EFFETTO UK - WELCOME 2021 !
Now it is not polluted air, it is eco friendly fire cracker
So to my knowledge they announced this was canceled then did it anyway? Did yall think the world was ending at first? Like 2021 suprise nuclear war
Wonderful!!!! Wish I was in the city to see that! 🎉🎉🎉
This was amazing
I think this was the ending we deserved well done 👏🏼
As frontline nhs worker, I cried
Whats with the marxist fist?  Marx was a lazy, elitist, snob, why would anyone want to follow him, unless they had evil intents?
This is beautiful

Imagine being there live when it was happening
Load of old shit
🎆🎆🎆🎆🎇🧨🎇🧨✨✨✨✨✨🎁🎁🎗🎑🎑🎑🧧🧧🧧🎀🎀🎀🎉🎊🎄🎄🎄🎈🎈
2:51 how they did it bro?
A kick in the shins for London taxpayers to put on a firework display they weren't even allowed to watch, especially for those who are facing a financial predicament as a result of the government destroying the economy. It was used for political propaganda, promoting the "new normal", endless lockdowns, the NHS religion and further tyranny in the name of "saving the Earth".
To everyone reading this: May this new year come with countless miracles, happiness, joy, love and compassion for you and for you to become insanely successful !
There's fireworks are amazing
Let's pray together for a happy new year...2021
Well done, London!  Cheers to all my Euro friends 💙🥂🎊🎉 💙
SAY BISMILLAH
Thank you for the NHS for helping people through this crisis
Sky: There will be no fireworks for 2021 BBC: *SIKE!*
Jesus is Lord ❤️🙌💯
Wow!
This is hands down one of the best firework displays I've seen & definitely beats any of the displays I've seen here in Las Vegas by a loooong shot.  Happy New Year everyone & much love!
OMG
I feel 2021 will be better!
Well that was depressing. I'm going to watch "Hale and Pace" to cheer myself up.
Happy New Year London's 2021
what a load of s--t, do they not know we just left Europe
Hope everyone is doing ok! Happy New Year! :D
My top  ten New Years celebrations in order of rank is  as follows.  #1:Sydney and London  #2:Dubai  #3:Philippine  #4:Hong Kong  #5:Thailand  #6:New York and the reason y I place them so low because they and incident where a boat caught on fire otherwise they be #3 with Philippine #7:Washington  #8:Paris  #9 Newzeland #10 ....................... Happy New Year to everyone 👍😂
LOVE THE NHS THEY ARE THE BEST ANYONE WHO EVER DISREPECTS THEM INFRONT OF ME WILL GET REPORTED TO THE POLICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
London always delivers!
Disgusting
New York got nothing on this one. Well done London!
Did  anyone else cry being so thankful they made it past 2020??? Also hearing the music
The dogs 😔
I think this was the coolest firework show for celebrating 2021. Happy new year London🎆
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
who ever f****** put a dislike u r f****** stupid and thats it just F****** selfish
Political garbage !
aww i thought ajr 'I'm ready' was going to play
Wow that was really impressive
*THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS NEW WORLD ORDER ANTI CHRIST RULE BOW DOWN AN EXCEPT LETHAL INJECTIONS AND THE MARK SUBLIMINAL PROGRAMMING* *

Absolutely amazing!
How do they rehearse this?
Yeni iliniz mubarek
Happy New Year
I just want everything to go back to normal 😭😭 it makes me so anxious thinking of whats to come.
Ок
Well Done England!
Wishing whoever is reading this a much better year 2021 🙏❤️
Was that a screen or were those actual fireworks? On the right.
the UK won
This was beautiful <3
Good 😌 I was crying
well, that was disappointing
2021 year yay 😀
Citizen: Can we have our freedom back!?  London: Enjoy the fireworks from your phone screen.
I don't understand ! This show took place for the lucky ones who broke the lockdown rules! I stayed home alone for New Years, should have gone outside to enjoy the show !?
Us brits do things differently
What about the rest of the UK?
United States...... take notes
Semoga bahagia dunia & akhirat
This is beautiful but very freaky at the same time..
This was incredible,invoked so many emotions!
2021
Don't mind me, just crying at 5:55 😅😩
This was the best!!!!
I propose that 2021 be called the "International Year of Health Workers."  In recognition of the work of all the people who have been on the front line helping society in the face of this terrible pandemic.  Likewise, to place a sculpture that commemorates it in each country.
BLM fist, seriously? We celebrating people that tore down our statues then, disgrace.
This was way better than the depressing hall drop in Times Square
a silent voice be like:
Whaou ! London you are definitely the best ! Happy New Year everyone !
Well boys we did it We hit Trending
I was enjoying the display until I saw the fist, thank you BBC for destroying New Years celebrations. I immediately turned the channel over because I don’t support political groups because that divides people which is something the BBC is good at. I’m definitely cancelling my TV licence now.
Why are they welcoming 2021 by on reflecting 2020 when we all want to move on from it
😍😍😍
Didn't like the political messages especially the Marxists hand gesture. ALL LIFE MATERS
americans gender reveal parties be like:
*This just made Times Square look really bad*
So amazing! Inspirational tribute that brought tears to my eyes. I love that they included the Captain  as.well❤️ Just beautiful UK!!
Supporting Marxist, great job BBC...
Wow this is so much cooler than ours in NYC...
😍😍😍
I miss my cat she died in 2020
2021 better for us all, but also for nature wild animals!! Let's not forget them. They as well have lives & feelings!! Happy 2021 everyone!!!❤️
Only one thing to say, AMAZING
Worst one in years, that's fine considering covid, but with cringe far left political messaging, now that's just embarrassing.
Nice firework display. I was thinking how this year separated humans from one another through hate and other social evils. I feel like that is not going to be over soon. Stay positive, lol. Also, how ironic to display the continents on a turtles back. That is Native American symbolism for turtle island aka mother earth aka Gaia. We owe Native Americans more respect and credit than we give them. Treat everyone Equally. Happy New Year!
Why was this kept a secret is just another stupid decision, as people need hope in the new Year
❤️❤️❤️
typical shite from london
#1 on GB Trending again - thanks for watching and HNY! 💕
London ALWAYS does it best 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
1:56 I quit my work thanks to this, Try this out just search for ,, *f u n d a i l y p a y*
The usual rubbish and propaganda from the bbc. well guess what, WE WON! De-funding YOU is next.
Well of course it was special this year! NEW FOUND FREEDOM 🇬🇧
What a damp squid
was hoping the crown theme nevertheless it was incredible .............
Brilliant.
ggh
So beautiful 🖤
I thought it was cancelled, so I missed it live :( this is sad
2:44 Does anyone know what the song is?
hey!Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love **
hey!Who else is trying to grow their YT channel during quarantine. Let’s help one another. Much Love
this was definitetly such a great way to leave 2020, and how they didnt tell anyone was so smart so nobody would come out.
Beautiful ❤️
May the New Year bring peace and tranquility to all
✝️Listen to my music ! Find "Rvckk" Anywhere !✝️
Seriously, what is there to celebrate? In 2020 the politicians started stealing your liberties. And in 2021 they will continue the job. And we can thank everyone who mindlessly continues to comply with the dystopian restrictions. Find yourself on the right side of history when the revolt comes.
Sydney and London probs top 2
Dumbass music too
Amazing hello 2021
This was a well-needed tonic for 2020! Thank you to everyone who made this possible and kept it a surprise :)
It’s so cute that people were thinking that the moment it turned to 2021 all the 2020 crap would be over
Oh geez. Get over the covid bullshit already
Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Happy new year
Yesterday I already forgot 2020 it was so much literally I enjoyed the end of the year as it never was, I appreciate everything more and this year a happier year and I start 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣1️⃣🎉0️⃣🎊🎆🕊️ hope.
I wouldn't  believe the BBC if they told me the earth was round...🤔
Yes let’s join together to rid this power political divide &conquer thought process called the bbc
Bruh y’all did all that         My ass was at home playing Minecraft with my friends 💀💀💀
Tyler is amazing
I’m crying 😭❤️
disgraceful behavior of the Windsor family abusing themselves and others they are suppose to serve and be served. Anything to change the name of the unease they experience within them being the people they are deep down. The truth is their disgrace and others that put up with the lies they give to people. They all know part of the Windsors truth alongside the elite of new scotland yard. Cressida Dick was honored by elizabeth windsor but dishonored by the real anointed one as to the pathetic windsor family that try to mimic the anointed one through fraud and deception of science and registries. A disgraceful legacy where the truth was brought to the open through the anointed enlightening the algorithm via the dormant cells. William and Kate have abused through the shame of truth. The anointed grandmaster was duplicated via a corrupt system all to control the masses and duplicate. you shall all be punished with time being your best friend.
＼(^-^)／
Even on Christmas we have to see blm bullshit
This is beyond of thinking 🙏🙏🙏🎉🎉  just go corona go .let's us enjoy 2021.
2:02: Earth Wi-Fi Router, for 👽 connect the Milky way Galaxy Internet.
Everything you want to forget that happened in 2020 nicely wrapped up into the 10 most cringeworthy minutes of my life.
01:17
i thought it was cancelled
New World Order.... BS !!!! Bringing politics into a fireworks display !!!! BLM crap !!! ALL LIVES MATTER !!!!!! Piss off with this NWO BLM rubbish !!!! We are ONE race! Human race !!!!
Happy new years everyone
Decent fireworks in itself but even with this you can't keep politics out. Pathetic and cringe.
Mrs. Doubtfire should have been the commentator
Well done London you did us proud.
Wow what an ameazing show. God bless. Aloha
The whole time watching this my focus was 90% on the lasers. They were honestly just so hypnotic.
Love how they did the fireworks in a different place in case there were a few hanging around big Ben hoping they would catch them
2021 is going to be better than 2020
Aww better than fireworks i say
What's with that African-American accented 'This program contains flashing images'??
My God I'm a grown up male construction worker but even my rugged eyes got wet when that bird appeared. What a masterpiece of a show!
It was all good apart from that blm propaganda
This was the best thing I've seen yet no kidding!! Spiderman drones are now reality, and the turtle ending was great, happy new year everyone and stay safe ❤️🐢❤️
Who the hell chose to include the crap music?
We ruled over half the world and now are celebrating a domestic terrorist cult while some foreign bird sings about a town that is not even in our own country, disgraceful propaganda
Who's idea was it to use NYE to ram woke crap down our throats..?
What an absolute embarrassment to the UK.  Impossible to get away from this woke BS. Who ever wasted their life creating this should be ashamed. Obvious patronising virtue signalling tosh.
‘LOVE TOGETHER’ who sets the standard for Love?
What a beautiful show great performance😍
Dont you just love David Attenborough ? Ahh that voice! This celebration was better than New York
Can't believe you ruined New Year's by spreading BLM propaganda. BBC I won't be paying my licence fee EVER again.i promise you that.
London. Happy New  2021 Year! ❤️
London : be smelling like fire
THE WEEKEND
1:18 The Thing Just Fired A Lazar Woah The Fortnite Live Event Has Started Boys
Mgiewnw
Have to admit, this is the worst NYE firworks display by London ever.
Sickening.
No place for blm scum. Shame on the bbc.
0:42 the eye of sauron
Wow best display
meanwhile in America were waving inflatable planet fitness balloons in the cold, waiting for someone to lower this massive sphere nobody can really see.
That is stunning!
London: "You're on Mute." Welcome to 2021, where your voice WILL be suppressed.
Its all Smoke mirrors and knives
I am a healthcare worker when I saw the elder man waving... I cried 🥲but most of all I could really tell the people in Britain really do love healthcare workers!!
I thought this was the season finale.
Hey whoever is reading this; have a great day and remember that Jesus loves you because he died for your sins, and rose again. It does not matter who you are, he loves you. Have a nice day!
Perfection. As England goes so does the world
Very cool!
THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!
This is better than America
This is the best thing I've seen today 🎆❤  Happy New Year 🎉😊
WOW
zs_88 check the Daily mail news it was a pre corded display before new years eve then actually broadcasted on new years eve by the BBC, so in my view isn't live at all. In what way am I posting lies? A display of virtue signalling to NHS and BLM, the money spent on the fake live event could of gone to the underfunded health service we have which in some hospitals is over stretched every winter due to cuts. Nightingale hospitals were never used and the London one being dismantled as they never had the staff for them. Also the millions wasted on the pick and mix of different vaccines that suddenly appeared within 9 months for a virus with over a 99% recovery rate and better treatment now, Boris although a tad chubby recoverd, Prince Charles and Hancock didn't even need hospital could have been spent on more NHS funding. Loneliness, cancer, heart disease, and dementia kills much more! Good immune systems through good food, vitamin D and zinc and exercise is what should be promoted not lockdowns and jabs for a virus removed back in March from the government list of HCID's, Remember Tamiflu?
Sadiq LIED!! Good start of the year for London!! Charming!! 🤢🤢
A disgrace. Psyops
Never felt this way watching fireworks on a nye❤️🎇 it took my heart. Truly so proud of London✨
Please check out my YouTube channel 🙏 new video every week. Or just look at my 2020 review plz
Well done London. Britts rocks.happy new year 2021 Hope's for better future.
Crappy message but fantastic light works!!
Disgusting of course they had to put BLM propaganda in the display
nothing like politicising something simple like a fireworks display for political gain
The part with David Attenborough made me so happy, love to hear his inspirational voice
One of d best new year celebration by any country a tribute to all frontliners
Wouldn’t 2021
This is way better than the New York one.
This is a joke all lifes matter not just black and thay do a display in it for them wot a joke
I absolutely love David attenborough his voice is just lovely and the end part was a phenomenal piece of art. Well done london!!
I cried my eyes out bruh
This honest made my cry 😭😭😭
This was amazing! Loved the drones and showing off more of London rather than focusing on the Eye for the display.
👍👏
0:58 = The Undertaker is coming..
Ive never been more proud to be British
Not me crying at a damn fireworks show ha
What’s that song called is it I’ll leave the light on can someone help me with the song
Was good up until 5:46
yes maybe we
Happy New Year London my in  daughter living her 🎉🎉🎉✌❤❤❤🎉🎉✨✨✨✨ beautiful
It’s nice and that but why lock everyone in their homes then spend so much on this should have given money to NHS and emergency services they will need it as coronavirus
This years fireworks were the best ones yet!
they ruined it with blm fist
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen! Repent and turn from sin! Obey God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
Well boys, we did it     *Coronavirus is no more*
Most moving summation of 2020. Thank you for leaving me with a smile and hope in my heart for the future.
woah..this is cool. Happy New Year's all!
I like the fireworks...the BS talking I can deal without.
Absolutely one of the best and most memorable displays well ever get. Best wishes everyone

Watchdogs legion
Feliz Año Nuevo! / Happy New Year! London and even new beautiful latest technology flashlight lights that shine. 🙂😉😊👍🕰🎆
happy dayz are among us
Woke, pathetic political gesturing, BBC all over. Note no brexit, no red white and blue even. Blue and yellow EU bird flying away and just a stupid BLM fist which needs shoving up the BBC's...
Get ready for more slavery.
2021
This is the same technology the government will use for the Antichrist
I love ❤️ all people in 🇬🇧 good people
Tired of having my face rubbed in this sh-t!
This was beautiful: the message & the visuals! Bravo London 👏🏻🇬🇧 Happy New Year 2021 🥳
0:37 I quit my 9-5 with the help of this. Try this out just search for ., *f u n d a i l y p a y*
mhm.   Like the effort. Goodjob, not just them, but you too. You did your best. Just my opnion. You can disagree if you want.
We dont want the shitty corona talk. We just want music and fireworks.
Forget the technology and how great it is, this is nothing but BBC and Sadiq Khan propaganda lit high in the sky for all to see.  Wake up and smell what’s coming next.  It won’t be nice if these people have anything to do with it.
The BBC and Sadistik Khunt couldn't resist taking one more communist shit down people's throats to see the year out.
Amazing god blessed 2021
Loved this!!!
The amount of braindead people in this comment section so butthurt about an anti police brutality peaceful organization makes me wanna throw up.
No Auld Lang Syne either
The best fireworks in 2021!
In Germany fireworks where banned. Stupid
I love this 🙏🏾 happy 2021 everyone 🙌🏾✅
First day of 202- and my house is already Burt to a crisp 😑
Utter *propaganda* bullshit. 9:15 - F*** off Attenborough. 9:45 '....for all the inhabitants of planet Earth...' *He means the ones left living, maybe not humans.*
IMPRESSIVE
Almost emotional watching this ....music could have been better though .....Happy 2021 everyone 😊
6:20-7:20 song name?
This makes me so proud 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🥂🍾
This is amazing
How many beings could we have helped with that money.. Happy new year to all.
Beautiful London!!!! I hope 2021 will be kinder to us all.  Happy new year from America.  ❤️❤️❤️🇺🇲
So what has the colours of the EW and blm got to do with New Years? You(British Biased Corperation) and Sad Act Khan just can't help themselves. BBC got crap for doing a blm segment in the Vicar of Dipshit and yet they still did it in this. The more you do this the more hate  you'll get, not less. Sooner the beebs ends the better, along with Sad Act Khant-Do-His-Job.
Happy new year London! I miss you😚
Love it
Upload this at 720p?! seriously?! Last year it 4k!  Anyway. Thank you all the same :D
tell me the musics please
I hope everyone enjoyed their last holiday celebrations...
The shard is a death star? Haha
Pathetic
Re Covid ... perfect to terrify the elderly and vulnerable st home.  Re inclusion... the subtlety and nuance of 'Black lives matter' only works coming from a Black person. It sounds pathetic and insulting coming from Whites. A complete waste of money.
They are laughing at us. Police vans lining the streets to keep people away. It’s a sick mind control operation resetting our expectations to zero freedom and shaming us for racism and the environment. Can’t bear this stuff with messaging like you’d expect from North Korea.
Happy new year
And Khan politicised it. Hardly neutral
This looks so fake when you look closly
A BLM display in the English New Years firework show... Absolutely cringe and 90% of people watching this show are too dumbfounded by the colours to see the agenda behind what they had just presented.  The 2020 globalist agenda is already cemented by the BBC to continue into 2021.  You know a nation is lost when they can’t even celebrate without attacking its own ethnic people.
Magnifique!
Todas as vidas importam, não só as negras! Isso é papo de comunista. E os abortos? Essas vidas não importam???
Happy woke year
how beautiful bro what a pity that here in brazil it is not like that more than watching this live and very beautiful ❤️
As much as I love this I think it was irresponsible to spend public money on this when people couldn't even see it in person which is the entire point of a firework display. I think the money could have been better spent on the NHS or helping the Homeless or distribution of the Covid vaccine or even combating global warming.
Mensagem claramente de esquerda... estou fora!
Why did I cry I go to Mommy and cried on her lap, I very saddd  gugu gaga papa
Wowwwwwww
Happy new year everyone
Terrific show. Shame they politicised it to promote a violent, racist, hate group.
Absolutely out of this world. Love how drone technology has come so far in such a short time. Well done London.

Happy new year from Pyong Yang
Can't we just have fireworks? You know just normal fireworks, like it used to be. why does the BBC have to turn everything political? This is literally just brainwashing propaganda. Defund the BBC.
COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA! THIS IS EVIL!
Man is this fire... Drones replacing fireworks!!! F'ing amazing
YAY!
so beautiful and 😥 from home 🏡
Who sings in minute 2:45?
Happy new year everyone
This new years eve. I wanted to stay up for 00.00  I couldn't was so tired and fell asleep.  30th December was at a funeral. This virus.
Actually brought a tear to my eye Well done my hometown ❤️❤️
Propaganda
Why add BLM to it the vermin who want to destroy our great nations history and soil the names of the people who made it great!
its so cool
Absolutely cringe.
I thought BBC meant something else
Remind me. Wasn't this the cancalled fireworks display with only around 200 Londoners watching a 5 minute light show?
Why add BLM to it
I wanna live therr
Wtf did not tell anyone
I only think in the dogs
Amount of technology is too much to handle.. but BBC says 720P is nuff. seriously use at least a mobile phone.
Damn that brexit money went fast
Only 720p , Where is 1080p??? Where is 4K version. It's 2021.
Check out my book on my channel thanks you
Happy New year 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Happy New Year
Happy New Year! Wow 2021

The siren in the end just to remind you it London
Like video

Gay
To everybody that lost loved ones due to Covid ( like me ) I wish you the best and be strong....Love you all
The black lives matter fist ruined it, everything else was positive. Anything by the bbc is shite.
UKs celebration is on another level
yay happy new yeara
Political bbc bollocks again
Absolute shit
A lovely gesture but the money spent could had been given to all the nhs staff who are risking their life’s for us
Nice
Heard and saw from my window cheers
Typical BBC  - FAKE NEWS,  there were no fireworks!
Waste of money on a woke display.
5:52 smh
GREAT!!! WELL DONE!!!
Happy New year everyone xxx let's hope we are going to have another year
Happy New Year 🎊🎉❤️👍💯😘
This was the BEST that I have ever seen
Eow
Whats the song 2:44 ?
Can we talk about the demographic that's doing all the stabbing?
I'll be here In 11 Months to see what happens in 2021. But is it just me or 2021 seems odd to me
WOW this literally gave me chills. Happy new year
Defund the BBC!!! we should not have to watch this tripe!! ✊🏿 the minute this symbol was used the TV turned off.
I loved these fireworks eye hope this year is better
Can I just say, thank you BBC news, London had such a great fireworks display but all ABC News showed was the Big Ben
The display looked amazing, loved the drones, the bird flying was incredible.  Thank you NHS you saved my mums life this year when she ended up in intensive care with covid.  Sorry but i didn't like the BLM fist, the UK is the most welcoming nation on earth that has embraced every creed and religion but the population gets accused of systematic racism and idiots take the knee to appease ideologies that do not represent the spirit of this nation and values we hold dear, sorry just my opinion.
The lights are PHENOMENAL!!!
Happy new year from Italy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🌟
I shed some big boy tears because of this - both in joy and the production value. Simply impressive. Thank you!
Best London new years firework display ever. Those drones are amazing
WoW🥳🥳🥳That was fantastic!!!
I hope you have a good time
Bbc is a disgrace...
The best fireworks I have ever seen in my life time! 🙌🏾
is this fake london: there will be no fireworks for 2021, it’s canceled.
¡Impresionante! 👏👏👏 Felicitaciones a los británicos por tan majestuosa bienvenida al 2021; aunque creo que los animales sufren con tanta pirotecnia 😧
This year’s fireworks were even better. I loved the new edition with the drones. It gave me goosebumps! 🥰
Very inspiring and gives hope
Canadians are very impressed -I have happy tears !
White lives matter too
Feel  so sad to see the  British people  canned. Wake up  take  back  your  freedoms
Much better than usual. Really enjoyed it. Usually just fireworks behind the London Eye. This year, fireworks, lasers, drones, bridges lit up - fab🥰
Ya whatever dude, it doesn't detract from the fact that Serena Williams is actually an eunuch.
Wow!! I assume that this is partly computer generated but nevertheless, this is incrediable. Well done to the creators. Amazing!!
Omg i’m in London
I can imagine Diversity dancing to this. There was a much bigger and better firework display in Northwest London with lots of people setting off fireworks from their gardens. Thank you neighbours!!!
What a load of leftard anti British bollox
brilliant drones
London event is like an Fortnite event lol
Amazing london!!!
I cried when I first watched this
Mulțumesc frumos pentru ajutor
Боуи 🖒
that fist the drone make in the sky strangely looks familiar. i swear i've seen it on the cover of the communist manifesto
BLM SCUM
SORRY!! But all lives matter RED, GREEN BLACK, YELLOW OR EVEN  WHITE !!!! stop this colour shit we are one humanity !!!!!!
So I had no idea this happened until 15 hours later 😂
WHAT A MASSIVE PILE OF CRAP.
Wonderful technology. But the political messaging not only offended many people but was deliberately  intended to offend many people. Another opportunity to unite thrown away. London needs new leadership.
Hi!

I miss London....... ;w;
Hi  2021  Happy New year
Amazing and beautiful. This is how to ring in the new year not like the boring NYC Times Sq ball drop, that was so disappointing. Go London!
very beautiful fireworks,hope someday i can be here to see this fireworks hello everyone Happy new year from kaits diary
Happy new year! Let’s all pray that 2021 will be better
I’m amazed so many people are surprised, I knew they would have fireworks, they said it was cancelled to keep everyone away.

Passing more laws to make Diversity work, is a must. 80 Years since the first arrivals, and God knows how many laws have been passed to make this work. I reckon maybe forcing people with more laws may start making this work. Maybe 20-50 more laws will result in making this work. I say take over all TV adds, and all the football games, with more laws would be nice.
One BIG blm advert I’m afraid! Absolutely Disgusting
Woke trash! 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Love u London
Really enjoyed it and well done London. This was so much better than years past and showed off London in a brilliant way. I hope they do something similar in future years.
This is 100% meant to divide.  There is no way Sadiq or whoever made this doesn't know that BLM etc is exactly that, divisive.  If you know that and claim to represent all Londoners then why do it?  Its  so me, you and others argue so we are divided.  The people doing this are the issue and we need to unite.  The people that tell us that we are the issue are the very people either doing the thing they accuse you of or they drive division.  Its time to stop falling into the trap and get rid of these vultures.
Happy new year 😄     To Londoners from Tokyo Tomin (Tokyo dwellers ) of the Land of the Rising Sun ♨️      May 2021 will be a great and glory to Londoners   I've seen the scenery of London many times , so I'm completely a Londoner .
i cant wait to see a video from 2020 that says "1 year ago"
Hello, just watched this a few mins ago. Fell asleep last night, due to all the boring crap on tv. The best part of this, i think was the drone bird, well done LONDON.
This actually made me cry ngl so fricken happy to be done with 2020  Edit: I know just because it’s a new year it doesn’t mean things will be suddenly amazing but the comment was just honestly to spread some optimism and celebration that we all made it through a year which tore us all apart ❤️❤️ happy new year and have a wonderful day ☺️
London always gives best new year show
That song really hitted me when they where talking about 2020
Am I not the only one hearing the Spyro 2 soundtrack? 9:00 Autumn plains
I tuned into BBC 1 last night. Nothing but concert by alicia keyes. Turned to sky news...only big ben. Nobody showed us the fireworks. It would have cheered my family up. So am pissed off by the media collusion to hide thefirework.
Happy new year London~
Thought that was amazing, if I was to say anything it would be that they never mentioned we are out of the EU from the moment we went into 2021. Think that is a big positive for the UK
The level leg morally irritate because driving coronally warm amongst a earthy sweets. succinct, offbeat witch
2021 ;)
The drones were amazing, and I love how the first part of the message (2:14) is a poem
Amazing UK!
Wooooooooo
7:20 - 8:21 my favorite part. Now that's a New Year's celebration culminating in a gigantic Sunfire explosion!
Great New Year celebration London. Come and see how great New York did.  It was very sad when compared to other great cities around the world.
Thanks, London... AWESOME program!  May God bless all of us mightily in this new year...
The nightingale hospital lying empty at £220,000000.

THINGS YOU NHS SO MUCH
this is insane and very imppresive how do people come up with these tings :) :0
Hands down the best out of other countries!  That drone choreography was stunning and a masterpiece. Proud to live in London. Happy New Year Everyone!
Very beautiful and touching as always.  Happy New Year!
I think the light display atop the Shard should now be a permanent NYE fireworks display feature!

Such a shame!! Mass media is the true virus, not Covid-19! Every year we are fighting against pollution and global warmth and we destroy everything within 10min.
not even one day into 2021 and identity politics is rammed down our throats,  and the blue and gold bird... So obvious colours of the EU not Britain.  Defund the bbc
As an American.... This was so much better. Lol we got a "Kia motors" clock counting down the last 10 seconds of the old year for us ... 🙄 I mean not even a Ford or Chevy but Kia .... Yep .... smh
what are the songs?
Song name at 02:48 ??
I Love London! this was an amazing fireworks display and i doubt anything topped it off. I may not live in London but I am super happy that my country has history with th UK
Thank you London! I'm in the US and our show was sad!
Happy New dear  وانشاالله سنه سعيده على الجميع ملئ بالفرح خالى من الأحزان انشالله نحقق إللى بدنا ياه  ونكون سعداء دائما 😄😄🎊🎉🎄🎆🎇🌌🎆🎇🎆🎇🎊🎉🎄
Incredible and amazing . Thank you
Y'all act like after 2020 every sht that happened will just disappear
I like the change of scenery.i think the location they chose this year was much better than seeing the London Eye every year. Also liked the drones was nice. But the shard looked abit creepy though.. Made me think of the all seeing eye of sauron in Lord of the rings!! Lol.
This made my family really emotional whoever choreographed this deserves an award this is amazing well done captain Tom and thank you so much NHS you all are amazing thank you sooooooooooo much xx
Could of given it a break on the plandemic bs and woke bs but  oh no spoilt it for me and many others
This is London's take-home for 2020 - we heroically caught a virus. Well done everyone.
Stunning display and great message.  Loved hearing David Attenborough’s voice at the end.
that was truly amazing to watch, hny all x
It's not really happy New year for us Nepali but to the people who have it     YOUR LUCKY!!!
Happy New Year from our family to yours! Greetings from the Philippines! 🇵🇭🌏
Thank you BBC 1! This is the highlight of my New Year's Eve in the USA! Fantastic!💖🎆🎇
The NHS have looked after me for about 12 years and they still do and when the NHS bird came up I actually cried
stupendo ! grazie !
Omg did we actually just have the best show in the world??
So lovely the sound of Big Ben and this display. So emotional, I had tears in my eyes. London never fails at New Year to deliver/
Why is everyone praising London fireworks display on the BBC its all a con just the thing the BBC would do there weren't any fireworks on the itv countdown it was some man talking and I'm prity sure if there had have been fireworks they would have shown them the ones that were on the BBC were from last year with the addition of some computer graphics
Yay for NHS HAPPY NEW YEAR 🥳
2021 just started and it'll get worse with the COVID19 People brace yourselves for the worst to come.
HAPPY NEW YEAR🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:13 What did the BBC become Team Maverick
London Eye: Am I a joke to you??
Watching from 🇨🇦.  It's the best fire work and presentation I have ever seen.
Yeah shame about the raised fist BS!!!!!
Fake live display it was recorded at 2am on the 31st when most people were trying to sleep, the big Ben chimes edited in. Fake like the news the corporate globalist's investors tell them to report and lies of the current dictatorship governments or Sage behaviour scientists advice them on for the BBC propergander machine. A lot of people not sold on the fear did celebrate around London Eye and Waterloo bridge in person rather than a socially detached clinical Zoom screen, eventually the TSG police moved people on after midnight yelling Covid go home as usually but at least they allowed them to see in 2021 after a year of on off house arrest from a dictatorship government run by Sage behaviour scientists trying to use fear to control it's people! Wake up to the lies from the globalist's corporates that have been financial investment in the BBC and mainstream media to promote their agenda for the reset before it's to late. Evil can only prevail when good men or women standby and do nothing. Tell a lie long enough and it becomes the truth.
Well now,lets put 2020 in hindsight ▪︎
This is cool
Very nice this year London did I better with New Years
This is so beautiful.. why im crying
This made me so emotional! Loved the light show and the fireworks were beautiful but makes me feel guilty enjoying them as I know how bad for the environment they are.
Sky news reported no fireworks or anything official in London last night? I am confused.
London: How do we reflect, give hope and show appreciation after such a tough year? New York: Who wants to buy the advertising rights?
Best one Ive ever seen
it's crazy how alot of us thought it was cancelled but we see this!   i know we cant see it irl but it makes me think about how much they try
I have to be honest, it feels like the BBC Dosent broadcast this because with the music. I feel like ITV Would air this but I do understand that they post it on here cuz they are the oldest tv channel.
This was definitely the best one
Wtf!!!!!! These people should be shot! Pure propaganda Jesus Christ!! Judging by the blinkered comments on here, The world is over!  Enjoy your deliberately engineered food shortages!!!!!
2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣1️⃣🎆🎇🎏🎏🎏🍎🍏🇧🇭
2020 part 2 bebe 😂
What’s everyone’s wish for 2021?
Ah yes more Marxist shite approved the arch Anglophobe himself Sadiq Kahn. No Union Jack's no patriotic tunes, just race baiting shite.
meant to be welcoming the new year... not this covid/blm/nhs propaganda
Hello I am from the future I am from 2021!
Not as good as last year!! But still spectacular
For everyone who died rip i hope good luck to all of as life been hard for all of as so I just want 2021 it be the best year of our life's life can be hard sometimes but you just have to deal with it no matter how much time you get hit down you got to keep on getting up dont let depression win you have the fire in you so happy new year every one from my heart I love you all for indore 2020
It was an outstanding celebration for 2021 and it was a fantastic fire work display and to put all the disappointing bad 2020 year behind us bring 2021
What symbol celebrates the BREXIT?
London has the best fireworks on new year 🎉
Absolutely brilliant 😍😍😍😍
Interesting to see the drone technology. We’ve just filmed the Madeiran fireworks which have been considered the best in the world. I find both of these equally moving.
Speed
This was amazing to watch! Brilliant!
This one was so dope!!! They really put on a great show for everyone with no advertising too!!! Americans was WEAK!!
Dispickable, so many couldn't go and warch, but they wasted money anyway!
Not good at all.
Watching New Year countdowns all over the world, on top of the most beautiful countdowns includes from Dubai, Sydney, Moscow. But the greatest among them is the countdown in London.  It was not just the fireworks display. It had 2020 through COVID and global issues on Black Lives, the LGBTQA+ Community, and our fragile planet earth. All of the fireworks, the drone choreography, the songs, and the messages, all of it was beyond beautiful.  With that, we can all act to hope together, love together, and heal together. There is no greater glory than being part of the collective effort of humanity to create a difference, in creating a better world.
It was alright until they mentioned the blm shit!!
Proud to be British 🇬🇧
Happy New Year I hope this year will be better
Woke, political rubbish...a disgrace.
We choose Live , not Zombo BBC TV Shows! Enough! Go out to the street's.
What a load of PC crap ,good fireworks though.
wow amazing
Perfect job, London. Way to bring on the new year.
These were AMAZING and just what we needed - particularly as they were a complete surprise after being told the traditional fireworks were cancelled.  So instead of the London Eye, they went all over London instead ;-).  Great messaging on NHS, Captain Tom, Black Lives Matter, the value of kindness and togetherness, and the slogan for 2020 "You're on mute"!  And to end with David Attenborough on the importance of taking care of our planet and all its inhabitants.  Well done!  PS. Yes, I saw the blue lines and yellow dots.  To all your naysayers, London is and will always be a Remain city, and proud of it.  We may have left but keep that star warm for us...
Stopping us for dancing with groups of our own kind. Closing pubs clubs. There laughing at us all.
This is the best display for the new year! 👌🏾
Loved this. Keep safe everyone and have a Happy New Year.
Taking all our money and boasting about it
The bbc - where the programming never stops and the memory hole rules the masses. Defund. Burn your licence. Give away your tv.
What a waste of money.
Out of the EU fireworks.
5:47, disgusting! Do celebrate leftists, the last minutes of your dominance, from now on, Great Britain is a sovereign country again!!!!
Happy new year 2021
Beautiful panoramic views
Beautiful
Very fantastic
Sod off Khan the true British despise you,and the bbc must be defunded.
It's the real Bell's sound?? someone tell me please.
Nice video
wow!!!
I love fireworks
Disgusting socialist propaganda at the end
Excellent show well done UK .Better than anywhere else in the world.
Disgusting
i cryed in beb when 2020 went away
What song is at 5:52
I question the mental state of people who disliked this awesomeness 😇
2021👈
Beautiful and very touching...happy new year everybody 🍾🎉🎆
Lo.
There were no fireworks in London this year
What a damm cheek .. waste of money.  And all for the benefit of the tyrants in parliament to watch.  How dare they put a display on in these troubled times !   You couldn’t make it up...   oh,,,!,! Hang on it is made up the virus is a scam .. silly me 🤣
Unnecessary air pollution.. Stop this shit
Hi oblivios
They are soooooo Luky 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😭😤😭😤😭😭😤😤😭😭😤😤😭😭😤😭😤😭😤😭😤
David Attenborough ✨💛
What a god damned shambles.
I'm not in zoom or london
That's so amazing and fascinating
Name of song at 08:05?
Well done 👏🏻 It's as simple as that, well done and happy new year.
Omg 😱
Idk why my tears came down ..so touching, memories, past .love u all from northeast
They need the drones next time, hopefully we’ll be able to gather next New Year’s Eve!  And also who just scrolled through the comments
Feels a bit like London Olympics 2012 <3  I loved the Olympics!!
😭😭 happy new year🎉
Why turn it into this crap and all the lil sheep follow.  This has been done to keep everyone.  Just where they want you.  And going all political . All lives matter this is a load of control bullshit.
Where's frank he missed the party 🤣
When you realise its Drones portraying those messages in the sky. 🤔👌
Too much money spent and too much noise. Very bad for the environment and animals.
2020 was awful.       2021 is going to be worse. Don't kid yourselves
This was strangely emotional. I am not crying
😍it s was very amaizing🎉
2020-2021 sensational years
So nice nhs
imo London always does new year the best and this was fantastic as usual
Wow !
It’s darn beautiful!!!!!
Aww, shame I missed this as was watching Hootenanny.  Amazing technology,  loved the fireworks,  animals and sentiment.  I had thought there weren't going to be any display at all !! Glad I can view on here!
WOW WOW WOW
Its, about Time
One word HOPE!!!
I AM LEFT SPEECHLESS !!!
😷😖💋👎👎👎
😭😭😭 ❤️❤️❤️
Why would king Khan have lots of EU colours.....anyone who did not know him would think he was a socialist and pro  federalist....not a proud brit,with centuries of heritage to call upon.  This makes him look like a "Reset" fan.
BBC Cut the bloody chat as it aint working, 👍
Yet again turning a moment we should all celebrate into a bullshit blm political message. Disgusting
Wow  ... what a complexity of engineering this is, and I remember drones displays first happening in Aussie and Japan.  Great that the UK have decided to use this in the Covid pandemic to deter crowds.  I especially love David Attenborough at the end describing the change of our Planet.  Wonderful.
Lived in Germany for 15 years, but this is my new year. Watching these fireworks I'm always proud to be British. We may be laughed at, joked about . but we are us. We make more fun out of ourselves than anyone could ever do. Proud, and miss home. Happy 2021 everyone 💓
Covid-19 Vaccine failed
Was some of this  computerised???
So there you have it, a communist symbol flying high over London. Wow!
😰😰😰
So the only people not covered are straight white people who make up 85% of the country
WATCH 2021 TURN INTO A fairy tale!
New year!!!!!!
Groundbreaking and here I was just about to forget about the BLM movement and all that they did this year.....only to have it personified in illumination...I feel sick watching this crap.
An impressive show aesthetically speaking. Unfortunately marred by overt partial political messaging.
HAPPY DEFUND BBC YEAR ,EVERYONE ENJOY THE NEW YEAR ,SWITCHING OFF BBC  TV ,RADIO ,GREAT WAY TO START THE YEAR, great New Year's resolution
More left wing nonsense. Even NYE it's self is now an excuse to applaud BLM.
This New Year Countdown doesn't only gave us the aesthetics of the firework and drones, but it also portrays a clear and beautiful message that we should be courageous despite of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you UK for this beautiful countdown. It made me cry while watching this. I really do hope that someday, I can visit this country and celebrate this beautiful new year as well
Absolutely amazing 😍 drones doing the images  looks incredible 😍
Que bosta
Wow! Wow! Wow! Happy New Year London from New Mexico! 🥂🍾
oh god it was nice until the BLM shit  what happen to the other people  they dont matter???  so racist
*Alhumdulillah the Year 2020 is over & no more.* We welcome New Year let's doing Dua together seeking from our lord to pardon all our shortcoming/bad deeds in the past and most prosperous life ahead in present & future. Allah is greatest, powerful, all-knowing & protector. Ya Rabbul Alameen keeps us safe happy & successful  here & hereafter Ameen.
Amazing
Black Lives Matter
Why does black people lives matter more than everyone else life ?!!!!!!!!
Brilliant.
So does everyone else's life enough with blm what about native Americans black aren't suffering anymore that ended a long time ago. Native Americans are still suffering you are just afraid because you know if you don't support they will scream racism for everything that's a😡 fact
A truly unexpected yet beautiful summing up of a difficult year in such a poignant way. Thank you BBC. A lovely surprise. ♥
Beautiful
omg guys happy new year you all this is pretty so so so so pretty
As usually amazing - even better than the last years!!!
don't you think its a bit weird celebrating a year where millions of people died
The New Year celebrations, fully anti-white. They had black voices, black music, black supremacy, all as a message to the indigenous people of these islands that our days are numbered, that immigration will continue until we will become a minority in our own homelands, and our fate will be like the Boer in South Africa.
It's funny most of the people who like this are the ones complaining about the damage to the  environment but yet they applaud this  🌍💥💨🤷‍♂️
It's so incredible, i hope they're okay in the meantime HAPPY NEW YEAR LONDON
So stupid. Why did it take so long for the fireworks? What's with the communist iron fist? Why focus on the horrible virus so much? Western Civilization is dead.
Happy those colourful lights made an end to 2020
There was no fireworks display this is BS
Loving the big communist fist in the air BBC. That's not going to annoy anyone.
Last night when I watched  it  I was crying
🎉Happy New years welcome 2021🎊
Had to ruin it  with blm
Amazing’ A big well done to the production Team and a thank you to Everyone 😂
From 1:05 to 1:57 is something like alien calling.... Scary and absolutely amazing light display. Never saw anything like it....very atmospheric
Why did I cry watching this :(
Best fireworks display I think I have ever seen.  May we all have a happy and blessed 2021.
soo-bloody-perb
Well done BBC 🎉 just what we needed ❤️
Wonderful.
Wow, jus beautiful.  Also thanks and praises to you NHS 🙏.   Stay safe and strong people 🙏
complete condescending rubbish. Why celebrate an hospital that cost millions and received no patients. Forgetting the celebrations would have been more decent. NOTHING TO CELEBRATE IN THE UK.
Above the Millennium Dome... just wow. I actually have no words for a reaction. Agog. There you are. A word. I'm agog. Bloody hell that's impressive. Screw fireworks I want THOSE in future! And fireworks are my favourite!
yess
It would be nicer with people in it but it's a beautiful display but no one is allowed to be there at all. What is the point all these countries including the usa spending millions of dollars and govts are in total control and the people all over this world are hurting and instead of helping the people they do something like this wasting millions of dollars
This fireworks display was a disgrace. Not only celebrating our system of socialized medicine as if it's not an institution and needs to be worshipped, it also celebrated openly Marxist revolutionary group Black Lives Matter, not to mention the celebration of forcing families to communicate from home by stripping us of our freedoms.
Wonderful!!!
Worst year the modern world has ever seen.Great Britain has just showed everyone how to end it.Look and learn world, Look and learn😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Holy shite, we killed it.
This is much more beautiful than the fireworks display in Sydney and Dubai. Glad to hear Tom Walker, Jess Glynne, and The Weeknd!  All the message, the songs, the fireworks display. This has to be the most beautiful, most reflective, countdown for a New Year.   What a great show London! 💛
As you can see if you compare New York to London.  London 10/10 best new year Eve
BLM? are we on about the same organization that wants to Burn Loot and Murder in america? wow
Happy New Year everyone. Here's hoping 2021 will be a good year for us all 🥂
Nice message. Full of hope!!!!!❤
Good afternoon 2021😘✨🎉
Happy Flu Year!!! Let old contagions be forgot....
And no one is here because they are on total lockdown
I thought this was real in London as well all fake
The Best firework ever in London . Xxx
Give us a like if you actually got choked up watching London bring in 2021 like you felt emotion you didn't know you had
Awesome something to be proud of Fantastic would love this every Year.
Brilliant! If you ignore the BLM bit. 👍🇬🇧
멋지네♥
The 3k people who disliked this. Imagine being that dull
EXCELLENT, YOU CONGRATULATE YOURSELF WITH 2020 IN 2021 !!! WELL, YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT TO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, LIVE AS IN 2020 AGAIN, BUT YOU SHOULD ! Hahaha
This has gotta be the best fireworks they have had in like 5 years tbh :D
haha the only realistic part was the  sirens at the end
I don’t know what’s with New Years but it’s always heart warming, I’m not an emotional person but this just wanted to make me cry
it was amazing.. Unlike NYC is so sad
Magnificent, awesome, inspirational.  Thank you. 💟💟❣❣
Yettttt London cry about pollution 😂
Get me a bucket!!!
Neo Marxist disgraceful production at 5:44
I LOVE IT!!!! That was BEAUTIFUL!!!
The best new years display in the world
So powerful absolutely spot on, so proud to be British no one is left behind !
At the beginning of any year, for most people, there’s always that feeling of *Ooh I hope this year’s going to be a good one* , and sometimes that feeling turns out to be true whereas other times it doesn’t. I’m sure at the beginning of 2020 I and many people thought to themselves *I hope this year will be a good year* , then it ended up being pretty crap. Going back to 2019, it’s not like 2019 was the worst year in history, but by default, I was generally hoping 2020 would be a good year, because it's a new year, a new decade, so why shouldn't it be a good year?. Sadly however it turned out not to be the greatest year in history. In the case of 2021, because of the 2020 crisis, I guess you could call it that. I think 2021, by default, will be a generally better and good year.   I got a feeling about this year   Hopefully, I haven't jinxed it by saying all that lol 🙊 😂 🤞🏼   *may every person who died of Covid or anything else in 2020 rest in peace ☮️*  Happy new year and may 2021, be a better and good year 🤞🏼
Ahh the black supremacy sign snook in there good more fuel for the pro white fires 😍
the bird honestly made me cry
Happy New year  greetings from indonesia
Why I couldn’t see this on live yesterday?
shit on the BBC,  government  mouthpiece  spreading  virus  bullshit,  empty hospitals,  ambulances parked up idle. NHS workers sat home on full pay,
This brought tears to my eyes. So nice to see an attempt to bring up morale while real life is so tough for everyone. Love it.
Guys 2020 was a bad year but hopefully 2021 will find the light in its darkness
what is the point of saying happy new year? for a lot of people there miserable life will continue to remain miserable.
This was amazing. Very moving
This is the best one yet ✋😃
it's awesome
Absolutely beautiful.   A beautiful message to start the year right.   The Drones were simply astounding.   Whoever collaborated and organized this should do it every year in London.   Thank you, this New Year's display was one of the most impressive ones I've seen.  "Keep Calm and Carry On".   From beginning to the end, touch me emotionally.   Stay safe and enjoy the new year,  new beginnings, new mindset.  Greetings from Chicago, IL and who grew up living in London, UK.  Seeing this brings so many fond memories of England. :)
Disappointing the organizers chose to include black lives matters.
Thanks for you live god
Blm marxist movement support. Well done bias bbc . Cringeworthy  woke b.s. .Fireworks good, message not so.
Absolutely brilliant!  Wasn’t expecting anything on NYE.  The messages and acknowledgement in lights, fab idea.
The words made me cry 😭😭😭😭a memorable year for everyone i wish 2021 will be in more peace and happiness Salute to the front line heroes who lost their lives may RIP The loved one's we lost may RIP May this virus be gone from this world and may we all learn the lesson of peace and care
2021 Brainwash
Beautiful
just out of curiosity: all these people who installed the fireworks on wembley o2 and tower bridge... are they essential?  they shut down the country for another  2 weeks but some people get away with carrying their jobs. NOT FAIR.   open the gyms Bo-Jo.  gyms are essential
Look at all the poor, terrified birds.
UK the best forever ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
HAPPY NEW YEAR BOÎS AND GURLS
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! 🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉
Very very good
i was tearing up the whole time but when David started talking at the end I cried
Loved this. I'm in Australia, but the UK can be proud of this.
Happy New Year
amazing night fireworks, good job! check out my new year 2021 music mix Have a nice day! :)
Its a pitty they ruined it with blacklivesmatter... I thought all lives matter
Happy New Year!🎉
Amazing 🥲 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Most beautiful firework in the world🇬🇧
WONDERFUL!!! What a send-off, London!!!  Goodbye 2020! Hello 2021!
Was lovely and then ........ got all political can’t watch now
Stop it Alreadyyy....😍😫🖤✨
I love this video
Happy New Year Everyone!
Bellissima idea per poter affrontare l'ultimo dell'anno con uno spettacolo così , da casa 😍😍😍😍😍🌈💖🇬🇪👑
good bye 2020
How much money did it all cost?
That was beautiful!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
What's the song before the countdown?
And they made the fireworks into a propaganda shitshow.  Enjoy 1984
In rolls 2021 obey the rules accept control take the vaccine and don't do as we do DO AS YOU ARE TOLD               "OBEY"
Missed it live, the Drone work was incredible, coupled with pyrotechnics and lasers, what a show 👍
(Only text about the Covid hoax .....  and BLM ?????????   :-(
Amazing images, hats off and well done to all who created them.And how appropriate that it should end with the words of our icon, Sir David. The world should get through this virus in a relatively short time-frame. But maintaining the long-term wonders of our planet is the main battle ahead.
Time seems slow but yet another year has passed with a beautiful shower of light
Oh jolly well done, all involved in this. WELL DONE. The poor duck towards the end obviously missed the memo: love him flying off quacking "WTF?!"
hahahaha epic!!  ROFL 5:10
The country in economic downturn the nhs at full stretch ye this will help millions in taxpayers money wasted just for bravado brilliant the BBC love this
Happy new year
i was literally praying no asteroid crashed down at the last second.

So cool
This music makes it so much better
Love

You all are the reason I am still going on thanks for all the love and care you you all have
From YHVH to all mankind! The last days are revealed! 2Co 6:2  For He says, “In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in a day of deliverance I have helped you.” See, now is the well-accepted time, see, now is a day of deliverance – Isa_49:8, as prophesied even  from the beginning. Gen 3:21  And יהוה Elohim made coats of skin for the man and his wife and dressed them. 3:22  And יהוה Elohim said, “See, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...”  3:23  so יהוה Elohim sent him out of the garden of Ěḏen to till the ground from which he was taken,  3:24  and He drove the man out. And He placed keruḇim at the east of the garden of Ěḏen, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.   Jer 31:33  “For this is the covenant I shall make with the house of Yisra’ěl after those days, declares יהוה: I shall put My Torah in their inward parts, and write it on their hearts. And I shall be their Elohim, and they shall be My people.  31:34  “And no longer shall they teach, each one his neighbour, and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know יהוה,’ for they shall all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,” declares יהוה. “For I shall forgive their crookedness, and remember their sin no more.”   I Am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life Joh 14:1  “Let not your heart be troubled. Believe in Elohim, believe also in Me. 14:2  “In My Father’s house are many staying places. And if not, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 14:3  “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I shall come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, you might be too. 14:4  “And where I go you know, and the way you know.” 14:5  T’oma said to Him, “Master, we do not know where You are going, and how are we able to know the way?” 14:6  יהושע said to him, “I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.  14:7  “If you had known Me, you would have known My Father too. From now on you know Him, and have seen.”   Test the Spirits 1Jn 4:1  Beloved ones, do not believe every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of Elohim, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.  4:2  By this you know the Spirit of Elohim: Every spirit that confesses that יהושע Messiah has come in the flesh is of Elohim,  4:3  and every spirit that does not confess that יהושע Messiah has come in the flesh is not of Elohim. And this is the spirit of the anti-messiah which you heard is coming, and now is already in the world.   See simple evidence Deu 7:7  “יהוה did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more numerous than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples, 7:8  but because of יהוה loving you, and because of Him guarding the oath which He swore to your fathers, יהוה has brought you out with a strong hand, and ransomed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh sovereign of Mitsrayim. connected to false worshiping  Choose Whom You Will Serve Jos 24:14  “And now, fear יהוה, serve Him in perfection and in truth, and put away the mighty ones which your fathers served beyond the River and in Mitsrayim, and serve יהוה! 24:15  “And if it seems evil in your eyes to serve יהוה, choose for yourselves this day whom you are going to serve, whether the mighty ones which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the mighty ones of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But I and my house, we serve יהוה.”  Repent now for our souls belongs to The One and ONLY Elo'Him Have No Fear Mat 10:26  “Therefore do not fear them. For whatever is covered shall be revealed, and whatever is hidden shall be made known. 10:27  “What I say to you in the dark, speak in the light. And what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the house-tops. 10:28  “And do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the being. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both being and body in GěHinnom.
Awesome as always London!
Grand, professional,😁🎵🎸
Wow so beautiful.
Cringe Fest what a SHITSHOW!!
You will own nothing - And you will be happy
Wow we live in the best country
Woke up at twelve  midnight and saw this after a few drinks, is this real? i thought there was not going to be any fireworks? is this computer generated ? if not how is it i did not here of it, shame on the communication, i would have tried to keep awake! . Nice to hear of a reply, cheers.
Beautifully done! It makes me happy to see a country not afraid to openly support healthcare for all, understand the value of the Earth and BLM.
Wemberly is the rainbow thank you NHS, thank you captain Tom.
I watched this last night at 11 pm ET as I'm in Toronto. I burst in to tears at the sight of the dove 🕊️🕊️🕊️ - and the magnitude of loss & as I watched I sent my love to those in the UK who lost a loved one in 2020. God bless London and the UK 🙏 I did giggle though tbh at how absolutely shocked you all must have been to see this show go off 🥳😂 Mind-blowing! Happy New Year all 🥳
Congratulations to UK for your New Year and new found freedom with Brexit !
idhar nahi hota kya pollution  diwali Ko badman karte ho  waise fireworks are 🔥🔥👍
9:00 is it Rabindranath Tagore's legendary song 'Purano Shei Diner Kotha'?
Just for once can we just leave divisive politics out of it, another opportunity to unite has been taken to divide.
What the hell is the BLM got to do with this?? It makes me sick ALL LIVES MATTER.
I’m confused - I was watching ITV news for the countdown, the clock chimed and there was nothing afterwards - none of this. So I assumed there was no display and switched back to Jools Holland. How on earth did ITV broadcast the countdown without this being shown?
UK 's emotional message thru their fireworks..sufferings worldwide due to pandemic..thanking the front line health workers...amazing lights & caring words echoed...brilliant indeed !!
This was extraordinary fantastico beautiful goodbye 2020 hello 2021 ❤
Pakistan  Zindabad
I’m so greatfull really of the nhs and all the key workers let’s make this year be the best year I can’t believe David Attenborough and captain Tom’s speech in the sky in London and thank you for keeping the uk and the workd safe keep up the good work and once again thank you nhs and all the key workers
This was spectaular.
Happy new year 2021 nice fireworks
The fireworks were really really beautiful with all the beautiful messages for hope and happiness and black lives matters, everything was amazing. With this messages our heart has to be more open and to stop the racist world. We live in the same EARTH doesn't matter of the shape of the color, etc. all we have to be kind with each other and friendly.
Amazing Happy New Year 2021
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL FROM PAKISTAN
🤩❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤍🤍
Crap - there was more to 2020 than blm and the nhs.  A call out to the families who lost loved one NOT to the virus - the hundreds of thousands of people who died because they did not get hospital treatment or who killed themselves because their mental health appointments were cancelled.  This was disgusting, you should have maybe mentioned all the empty covid wards in hospitals where people with other illnesses could be treated but which have been left empty "in case".  The only health staff I applaud are those in doctors surgeries who are working all hours seeing all of those who are otherwise left in abeyance, they are the people doing all the work.  Clapping like seals and banging pot lids is an embarrassment showing what a sad lot you are.  What about all the other people who worked much harder and longer hours than the "covid" nurses - the delivery men, postmen, police and fire personnel, shop workers who were meeting hundreds of people a day.  Sorry London, that show of support for a murdering and racist group blm really put the cap on a crappy exhibition.
i wish i was in london
this was truly amazing and showed respect to the tough year it has been! :)
We must have the best IT ito do the fireworks and lightning choreography together. Who’s with me?
С Новым Годом!!!Что это?на небе лазер или дроны?
Wowww ...Happy New year
This is sick
So much nine
Who would of thought three communist hand gestures flying over the million dome in London would be so greatly liked. The BBC is rotten to the core. The far left brainwashing of the UK is in full motion and a majority just gobble it up. Fools
This is weird as shit.  It's about as close to propaganda as you can get.
Let's not waste any opportunity to push the blm garbage. Good job London. It's seems you forgot what happened when blm rioters marched on your streets.
That was most impressive.
ماكو عرب اذة انته عربي حط لايك
Annoyed that i am only now getting to see this, Watched sky news last night at midnight only to be told that there was no events taking place in london, and that the sound of fireworks was "Nothing Offical". Er what the hell is all this then?!
Creative and moving messages ! Let’s hope for a COVID free 2021!
Wow🦋
Happy new year everyone! 🥳❤️ I hope 2021 is good for all of you
Did you enjoy the underlining commie message in this...?
This was amazing. We went 2 years ago and i thought it couldn't be topped.
THANK YOU for the amazing message and HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL across the world 🌎
What a disgrace! Supporting the racist terrorist political movement, BLM.
david attenborough does not mind scaring all the pets and wildlife in london with fireworks
Woow dla bad
London definitely the best this year, Dubai is runner up
Thank god they told us that Black Lives Matter, otherwise I would’ve forgotten..
Hindsight is 2020.
Not nearly as good as in recent years. Disappointing.
2021🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Beautiful shame we miss to see this🥳
A lovely surprise to wake up to. Here's me thinking no New year's Eve fireworks. The Mayor did a wonderful job summing up what was a difficult and emotional year in all sorts of ways. Message was spot on and so was the fab use of drones.  To the nay sayers, doomsters and gloomsters... We live in  political times and leaving the EU was a part of the backdrop to everything else that happened last year. We got through it together. We will get through this year together. Stop moaning!
Happy New Year everyone! Hoping 2021 will be a good year for all of us.
Beautiful, brought tears to my eyes😥 Happy new year everyone
Happy new year family❤ you
That was so good omg
,💗2021
Crazy
Sick London  happy  new  year  to every one ....
Wow, beautifully done!!! Finally we can be proud of our country & her people. Happy 2021 xxx
I thought at first Batman will come out flying through those spotlights! :-D :-D :-D I love it, really!
Ini biasa aja, gak ada yg istimewa plus ada satu statement perlu di cek kebenarannya....
😁😘2021
Hz.Adem soyundan gelenler like atsın
Where is the protest in Britain for the children suffering in Yemen, we get the protest for black lives which am thankful for but the world is seemingly hushed as children take their last breath on world news all because of starvation. I don't care who wants to fight who but as long as the innocent and children are dehumanized then am Loud!!!!! But I can't be the only one this is not a one person not a one nation thing to give voices for the suffering children and innocent people in Yemen.
Attenborough is a voice over artist , nothing more
This will be remembered for a long long time definitely the best new year display and always we pull through. Thank you so much NHS
This yr
Hi, people happy new year. I just created my tiktok compilation channel. Come and give me strength and a blue thumb. Thank you
they used drones
The BBC and London City Council should be ashamed of themselves. Instead of celebrating the New Year this was a look back at last year. The Black Power salute was horrendous, the music was not a celebration of UK talent and references to the great reset are appalling. Where was the BREXIT hope message, the return of freedom and independence, the forward looking message, nothing to be seen. London cannot afford to keep the trains running without bail-outs from the rest of the country but can afford political displays on New Years day. Being in lock down is bad enough without being fed a constant diet of anti-white woke rubbish by the left leaning out of touch media and 'passed their sell by date' politicians.
i loved the drones
What about the environment woke folk ? lol
no joy, scary
happy new Yor 2021
Dream country ♥️ happy new year 🎉🎊 welcome to 2021
It’s eerie in a way.
Everything is about the " messaging " , it's disgusting.
Beautiful display and message! It summed up my feelings for 2020 and hope for 2021. NYC needs to up their stale game.
Wonder how much that cost that just went up in smoke
Tower Bridge makes a good spot for the fireworks. Should use it in future. I love the ones at the wheel but it's no an especially interesting thing to look at.
So the government wasted money since people weren't allowed to attend?
0:28 Wish you an amazing 2021. I have today all I ever wanted because of this. Check this at ,. *f u n d a i l y p a y*
The J ws are double down hard
Amazing display, but wokeism at its finest. Let's drop politics (and hopefully Khan) next year, please.
It's just like Watchdogs Legion
Proud British 😍😍😍😍😇😇
🤩 😳 😯 WOW! AMAZING!
Amazing..fantastic..inspiring...what a great nation we are!!! 😁
I He is was a big Christmas superior grill baton
Those drones was so beautiful ❤
ALL the GLORY IN THIS WORLD be IN you my DEAR Love GOD, HALLELUJAH 👑👑♥️🌠
It was amazing and I take my hat off to the NHS and captain Tom but why not put something for the British army because if it wasn’t for them we wouldn’t of had the nightingale hospitals or any of the ppe being delivered to the hospitals and many current serving personal are driving the ambulance to free staff up and they help with flood relief whilst all this shit happens but no proper thanks to them and not only that they are being over stretched and understaffed but they always still deliver regardless
Stroking Fist. Pathetic.
What a load of propaganda bullshit!
Happy New Year from Israel! 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Yeah happy New year Britain....while Yemen is in the abyss war that is fuel by no other Britain causing children babies to be dying of hunger malnutrition and here we are saying happy new year that country is suffering from not just the corona virus, but a virus of people in high places greedy desires for power that is taking food out the mouths of babies. Yeah so go ahead drink your 🍷 and champagne
London you have amazed us! Nicely summed up our highs and lows. Much love from Ethiopia.
Loved the Sir Captain Tom piece 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
More " woke " propaganda ... defund the BBC !!!!
Happy new year all!!
??? ??? Black Lives Matter ??? ??? How about ALL Lives Matter ??? ??? Breathing Life - UNmasked !!!
GOD bless BOTH of you GUYS for AMAZING work you DID, IN FIRST DAY OF THE NEW YEAR 2021,AMEN 👑👑♥️👑🌠
I Love London
Watching the BBC News Channel there was no introduction or commentary, no indication of whether the show was real or a simulation.
London always kick the world ass regarding new year fireworks even tho this year wasn't as massive it was amazing the drones the rainbows the lighting everything they had undone everyone else once again they never disappoin now this was like a dress rehearsal for what they can actually will make next year
WOW SUCH INCREDIBLE ♥️♥️♥️♥️ 2021 GOD BLESS ALL THE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD, HALLELUJAAAAAH 👑👑♥️🌠
It's all great, but where are the people??? 🎆
This was beautiful ❄️
Shove your fireworks up your arse, I’m still pissed off I couldn’t neck off with some tart down the pub
Thank u happy new yr and happy new year to u too London 😀😊💟👍.
I can’t watch this because it makes me tear up every time
Happy new year🎉🎊🎇....
Tragedy.....!!!!!
Fantastic
I think this was the best one they have ever done :D
This is why England’s new year fireworks are the worlds best! What an absolutely stunning and perfect display! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Happy New Year from across the pond in NYC 🎉🍾
Hi from 🇺🇦🇬🇧
What a waste of money that could have gone to the nhs when they need it most.
Was truly amazing and beautiful love the drones display brought tears to my eyes such a powerful and an emotional message Happy new year 2021
Wow! Epic! Love it! My favourite this time! :-D
Too bad I was in the polish countryside and not at home :(
So why are the NHS in there when they are not busy??? What's up with the messages? And what's up with comment section? Who was paid to leave one? 🤔
Amazing! 🙏🏻❤️
Wonderful firework display and drone technology! Wishing the best in 2021🎆
Happy New Years to all Family and Friends 🎉😊
Best ones ever.
Happy New year /                            /                         /                      /                   /                /             /          / Happy  New  Year
WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! a firework display with no audience!
Absolutely brilliant! Crying my eyes out!!
Lindo
Whoever choreographed this deserves a raise. The drone technology & message is incredible !: )
Let your New Years resolution be to come to faith and believe on Jesus only he can save you.
fantastic !
You wouldn't say that if you were black
Of course they had to politicize New Year didnt they......
Best display ever I reckon. So impressive
I Love the loud music and the loud fireworks❤❤     We can be hero 's  for the people that have Covid 19❤❤
they honestly made it seem like they were doing nothing for the new year in london but WOW love the firework and drone combination, very impressive and different. HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021.
You should work for Rupert Murdoch
I hope 2021 is so much better ✨❤️👈🌍
It made me cry, it was amazing but so emotional. No other country can top this one
this is the best ive seen this year. i dont know why i didnt see this in giant media compilation videos.
This is honestly the best thing that London has done. Hopefully 2021 will be a better year.
Can't believe the complaints about the light show for the NHS etc how dam disrespectful..
stop distroying are history
So far, the only ones who did a drone light show during 2021 countdown are Korea and London.
Oh your all on lock down, But we gotta keep up with the joneses, Welcome to 2021 welcome to the new UK stasi state. Keep the NHS safe is the biggest joke spewing from the parasites mouths ( MPs)  so safe they refuse to give them a pay rise,
Government propaganda. Like something from a dictatorship.
❤ I Love You London ❤
Black Lives Matter ruined it
why say that
why saty that
Of course they had to get the good old black lives matter in there! A whole years worth of propoganda bullshit in less than 15 minutes! Thanks BBC
LOL Germany was without because of COOOOOOOOROOOOOONAAAAAA 🙄🤮
white lives matters
Emotional 😭
The end looks like the bridge being blown up
I was enjoying that display till the racist slogans and BS came up again 🤦‍♂️ Poor BBC and goverement, when will you learn 🤦‍♂️
It's been a tough year I hope everyone is celebrating and having a good one so far. You made it through 2020! Well done x
F... off BBC fake news.
Just watching for the second time, yet again it's made my chin twitch and water come out of my eyes....very emotional, very impressive....also made me laugh, god I'm a mess!
My New Year's Resolution Is 144p
Happy new year best wishes for 2021
Did dynamite come on
Drone tech is amazing, difficult to comprehend the complexity of the programming of 300 Drones.
WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE A CHANGE FOR 2021
We should make the switch for displays using only drones and lights - fireworks are so bad for pets, the environment and everything else.
2020 season-1
Fireworks kills birds. It should be ban for every country. this is the shame of all humanity. you can't have fun while killing something living
Happy new year to everyone
Shame about some of the musical choices.
The new hospital isn't even in use!
1:48 Wish you an incredible 2021, I have today everything I ever wanted thanks to this. Try this at ,. *f u n d a i l y p a y*
Dam I missed this on tv as I thought they wouldn’t have the fireworks this year🙄
THIS WAS PHENOMENAL.
Let’s try and make this a better 2021, hopefully.
Wow I’m tearing up! What a amazing show. Hats of to any one who was a part of this. What a finish to 2020 👏 Happy New Year 🥳
❤ To all healthcare workers. Happy New Year! May the good forces be with you!
Simply splendid!!👍🏻👌
Awesome
The drones were brilliant 👌👍💪
Happy New Year 2021
Bet boris and co had front row seats
5:45 WTF open support for extreme leftist cult BLM? Who made this show?
They really did trick us into thinking it would just be some lasers and big ben but I am so surprised on how amazing this is! In my opinion its better than the traditional London eye fireworks, although those are also amazing!
Fantastic show this!
Đẹp quá đi ta
What a load of crap if that is the best that could be done for new year god help us😡
CANCEL YOUR TV LICENSE! STOP PAYING FOR THIS BLM WOKE BULLSHIT
London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan deserves all the praise for approving the intent of the show. Big salute to NHS guys and always a great time to stand for BLM and climate change. Hope UK had not opted out of EU though!
Amazing, perfect as usual!
Wow im living in a dump
🎇🎆🙏🏻❤️🧿🧚🏻❤️🙏🏻
years and years  vibes
I was not expecting to feel so emotional watching this incredible light display and fireworks and the message of togetherness - thank you for this.  What a great job at lifting our spirits.  Happy New Year!  Be kind, be sensible, be safe.
The fireworks- AMAZING! The messaging- leftist victim hood garbage
Yooo ! Anyone could remind me the song name at 1:58 ? Thanks !
Nice but some of the music is shockingly bad.
Happy New Year all I am wishing you a happy, prosperous and joyful year ahead in Jesus name. 🎊🎉🍾

Absolutely stunning display, takes your breath away and tugs at your heart strings, let's make 2021 the best year ever Britain 💗❤️💗❤️
As we leave 2020, I want to personally thank the BBC, ITV, CH4 and Sky for making what would have been a difficult year into a totally depressing, life sucking, soul destroying alcoholism inducing utter crap experience for anyone daring to turn their TVs on during a news cast. Made worse by non-stop begging charity adds showing untold misery and animal cruelty.
England made is a remarkable new year 🎉
Woke crap
Fantastic!
Thanks for shoving BLM down our throats
WONDERFUL MESSAGES and choreography ! Proud to be British! Love London! Fantastic work !!
best video i've seen in 2021 yet
Can’t they put whoever organised this in charge of the country? The best thing about 2020 came just after it ended. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Happy new year everyone
What was the Name of the Song at the End?
Let this message be clear to everyone and let's do better this year for humans and animals. We know better so we should do better to protect the world we are in ❤️🤗
when your expecting fireworks and vibing music, but no they throw in everything you wanted to forget about 2020 into it.
Wow! Wow! In my personal opinion, this is the best, best fireworks display ever.  You have brought happy tears to my eyes, a strong pounding beat to my heart. The display is just so fitting, so meaningful, with powerful messages and thanks to our NHS and Captain Tom Moore and to others too, it's so moving. This year's fireworks have given me hope.  A very warm hearted, Happy New Year Everyone!   Amazing! Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️
Happy New Year to my family and friends in the UK!
2021
Proud to live in England 🙌
The orchestration of the drones was amazing.  It's only going to get even more and more interesting each year now since technology is advancing so fast.
Fifth time watching, still crying
5:44 starting the year with a Political Broadcast.
Fantastic,Happy New Year to everyone x
I love❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ landan
Thank you London! As a care worker, mum of an intensive care nurse, an emigrant I felt so happy to be part of London. Everyone matters! There’s  hope for the planet 🌎 David Attenborough. Thank you 🙏
Lefty bollocks.
Nobody else see this a massive waste of money??? People are so blind
0:46 Wish you an incredible 2021. I own now everything I ever wanted thanks to this. Try it at ,. *f u n d a i l y p a y*
Absolutely fantastic display great to see in these miserable times x
The songs they played suited 2020 soo good
Burn Loot Murder
why are they allowed to use our money to put black power signs in the air?
Was watching it with great pleasure till BLM arose. WTF??? Nothing else to mention?
This is actually amazing...
Those drones deserve a raise
Me last night: Sleeps* Hears fire works* Woooooooooo no more 2020
This is soo good the drones made it 100x better
Wow, it’s so beautiful, and adorable..
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
it was amazing, i tried to hold in the tears but i couldn't.. we all lost someone this 2020 and we are just grateful to be alive🥺 May this 2021 bring many blessings for all of us!  Stay Safe
the person who choreographed this did so well!! they should do the light show every year along with the usual fireworks! happy new year :)
Wow nyc fireworks were so depressing but this is so hopeful! Who ever choreographed this needs a raise!
Rimorav vlogs subscribe please
2020 Was a rubbish year but we can remeber that kindness got us through the yea
Happy new year!!!! From Dubai  Hope you guys (whoever’s reading this)   Have a great year!!
What's there to celebrate being a prisoner no freedom. Covid won't go away that quick
Sorry but this is meant to be celebrating the New Year not another lecture. If ever there was a time to forget this year for a half hour this is it. We in the rest of the country have nothing, except lockdown, and I don’t want another lecture while sitting in my house doing sod all.
That beautiful 😍
They really did shove BLM down our throats didn’t they?
More anti-white, anti-British nonsense... but muh NHS
Very emotional , it is just amazing , great work .
BLM is a terrorist organisation.
Stunningly Beautiful ❤️
2:40 title of this song?
Fook BLM
Why am I in tears watching this? Amazing how this can move you so much, end of a terrible year but start of a new future. Lets hope 2021 is much better.
How come no one knew about this? Loads of us live in London and knew nothing about it, we were told no fireworks and celebrations all cancelled. I'm seeing this now, would have loved to have seen this last night.
London's firework is magnificent 🥰
The best new year eve 😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳👍🏻
Was that BLM fists in the display? FFS When will we get around to scraping the licence fee?
Sir David Attenborough 🙏
Loved the whole theme ❤❤
Coronavirus didn't spontaneously disappear Me: ._.
Incredible!
The fireworks display was amazing 👏🏻👏🏻💥👍💥👏🏻💥👍👏🏻💥👏🏻👍💥👏🏻💥 Happy New Year,I hope this year will be better than last year ❤💋❤💯
The part with the bird really got me. So emotional. To me it symbolises freedom and hope to “fly” again after all we’ve been through. This year has been a struggle for so many of us, but so many in the world struggle even more besides battling the virus. May this year be much better for all of us.
Happy New Year to all.
Happy New year
Shit we missed it
Happy new year's 2021 blessing always Good luck way haldi om shanti baba thankq God very nice lovely beautiful
Wow.. Incredible.
You sound like an idiot talking on YouTube
This was so beautiful, happy 2021 everyone, here’s to a better year 💖😊🙏
London never dissapoints, even in the middle of pandemic. The show was amazing with the drones and laser lights too 🎉
The BEST - I am in love with the flying bird.
I loved the drones doing the moving animals, rest of it was a bit cringey. Great Technology though. Bit year 7 presentation in the execution
This is the cringiest, most pathetic fireworks show in the history of New Year celebrations. Just gotta *push those narratives* into the new year! How embarassing for the Brits.
this made me cry so much
Looks good apart for the political overtones and commentary drivel being spoken. Stick to celebration of NYE not politics.
Happy new year
HAPPY NEW YEARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREREREERERR
That was a brilliant display, especially the laser display above the dome,Except for the totally unneeded BLM reference, how did they get those pinpoint effects? Only thing is more BBC lies, they had been reporting there would be no fireworks this year! Lying buggers!
Amazing!!!!
ruined by BLM propaganda..   when will the BBC learn....????? prob never, so cancel your tv license and stop sponsoring this drivel.
The celebrations in Pyongyang were more fun and contained less propaganda than this weaselly effort.
This honestly made me emotional
Stupendooooo
Stay Strong UK! And so is everyone...HAPPY NEW YEAR!
Dislike for the BLM shit.
Horrible
London is no longer an British city.
Animals lives matter
Unbelievable propaganda this show is, just unbelievable, you really need to have IQ of a room temperature to buy this shit.
The person doing American new year: I have 4 hours to beat this-
Stop leaflet distribution.
When you realise the BLM movement is a Marxist movement and has not donated a single cent to the black community in Education, rehab, jobs, benefits, youth activities. NOTHING. Just look at their website and you see their donations are to WHITE RICH people in the Democratic Party. OPEN YOUR EYES!!
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE. Good and interesting fire works👍👍👍👍                 Jitheshsathyan
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish you a Happy New Year! New Years is soon! A new ERA is coming! all troubles are behind! May the good mood never leave you !!

Incredible 👏👏👏👏 100% agreed Whoever choreographed deserves a raise  This best
Proud to be british,  bit of a change about the place we use to, but lovely messages to everyone , nice display, wat can I say " happy new year everyone "
Happy New Year everybody!!  Have a great year :)
Brilliant.
There was nothing wrong with 2020, if you didn't believe the media and politicians the year would be the same as any else.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Those drones were amazing I`d not seen that tech before . Lets all come together this year , brexit is done , the virus is here and we can`t do anything about it . So let`s just stop the in fighting and come together as a country and show the rest of the world that we are strong and capable . 2021 is going to be a good year , I can feel it in my water as my Nan used to say god rest her soul . Happy New Year everyone !
Did they really played all those fake news?!
Happy new year
The spyro sample at the end, THAT'S how you start a new year!
Amazing really
All good, Untill they fucked up with Black rioters LiVEs MaTter Bull.Shit
The only bit missing was 'mind the gap'
Why are we advertising BLM? The scum who vandalised, looted and burned so many businesses and destroyed historical monuments of people instrumental to this country. Hell they even breached lock down on masse and made this coronavirus infinitely worse than it should have been, causing the deaths of a great many more people and prolonging the lock down for the whole country.  Shit might as well start advertising Al Qaeda there too at this rate. They do the same things.  Just because BLM has a good message, it doesnt make them good people. The fact that they displayed and encouraged BLM I find is absolutely disgusting.
tone deaf cringe
Ours was the best one this year, well done London.
Absolutely loved this! I remember ages ago there was a suggestion that various locations could be used but I assumed that even that had been cancelled so this was an incredibly special surprise. Even better was the fact that the BBC were not cutting away to show crowd reactions, or view from behind Big Ben, like they normally do. Thanks to everyone involved 👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
This year the fire works had been cancelled? Isn’t it?
Haha this cracked me up Especially at the end when David Attenborough talks about climate change while letting of fireworks haha
They lied again.
Omg
This was beautiful
Imagine having a German mayor of London in the 1940s. So gross. Fxoff Sadick
This spectacular performance can only be done with nobody in central London to watch it. Definitely a t.v. only display and it was the best new year firework celebration I have seen.
So glad they got sir David Attenborough in there
Happy New year 2021
A pandemic that’s taken thousands of lives and you tell us to stay indoors but then are just feeding people opportunity to go out and watch your display? YOU SAID IT WAS CANCELLED FOR A REASON. stupid stupid country
Great display!
Even with every thing they still pulled them off
Am I the only one crying
My mom is nhs
Amazing
This felt so owellian..if you can move out from this big cities ,please do..no much time left
Big up the NHS!!!
Why was this so good
Wonderful!
Pay rise would have been nicer .. or more important  the money going towards the homeless or our vetrains that have been forgot ... Sorry I know I'm a party poorer ... happy 2021 or should I say 1984 ..
Great until they got onto politics, but that’s the bbc all over. I generally feel things like this need to be taken away from the beep. I’m a front line worker who is coaction so why is my effort any different?
And of course right at the end as Attenborough's voice fades to the sparkling turtle you hear a siren going off. New year's wouldn't be the same. Amazing work though in lighting set up and just about everything from the London firework's show's. Happy new year I suppose
Thank you from an ex-colonial.
All see equality picture Indian 👌👌👌👌 you
Happy New Year 2021
Boring
Hey, don't dislike this video please trust me😓
powerful.
HAPPY NEW YEAR YEEEEEYYY
Well, this looks like as if its another planet ! London usually has so so fireworks displays compared to the rest of the world. But this i think must have outdone all others around the world. For once London got it right ! Aah...at last...
สวยมากๆๆๆ
Amazing! This was really moving and astonishing... I'm proud to live in this country and especially in this city. Thank you for this wonderful display.
The best in the world 🌍 introduction to the new year 2021 , I'm proud of this hard job Britons .... Well done !
THANK U SOO MUCH NHS U GUYS HELPED ALOT DURING THIS PANDEMIC!🥳🥳🥳🥳 YALL DESERVE ITTT. HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONEEE
It was such a nice surprise and whoever choreographed it deserves a raise! Love how it included the NHS, BLM, Captain Moore and David Attenborough. Such a nice start to 2021!!!!
Happy New Year London!

There was no light show. Subject access filmed midnight in London check that. This is madness
Congrats guys for surviving 2020

Love that David Attenborough had the last say.

Only cameras saw it
That gave me goosebumps! Amazing.
Ooo 👌👌
Obscene waste of money.
Happy New Year to our British cousins!  You made a spectacular display.  Thank you.
I watched twise and it so beautiful
👎🏻 London as fallen, the English need to take their country back from the enemy within! This can’t continue.
У них же новый штамм вируса, что они себе позволяют))))
Very well done. Beautiful and moving messages. Very different than any one before.
Me: so glad 2020 is gone 2020: yes but my effects will be with you 4everrrrrr

Happy new year
This literally gave me chills omg! Love it
I got goosebumps
Once again Sadiq Khan trolls the UK with political messaging to suit his agenda.  The repulsive Mayor of London doing what he does best.
Wow that was spectacular
There was no auld lang syne? Shame
Happy new year y’all
2:43 goosebumps
HAPPY NEW YEAR
Wow, really outdone yourselves, the lightwork was incredible!
Disgusting display of propaganda. I hate what our country has become.
First I was like what futuristic bs is this , and then it started and my heart exploded  I’m NHS I’m  BAME , thank you London ❤️ I’m not crying, you are
The Spiderman movie is going to come true. Those drones were sensational.
They should do this every year to look back not just fireworks and it makes the earth less smoky
its better then doing something wrong on new years eve .  must be pray for each others . wish you a fresh english new year just forget the mistakes u done in last year . stay home keep ur self warm with warm food because corona virus spread with cold thing . cold food and cold drinks creats flu and that flu turns to an virus. stay safe and stay warm.

Stop forcing your political views on everyone ffs. Thabk god people are leaving the BBC en mass!
2021 here we go. Now this is where shit gets serious 😶
Our planet is unique,  living world of diversity! Happy New Year!
HAPPY NEW YEAR
Woke BS. Khan should be deported to Pakistan and the BBC licence fee scrapped.
2020 was only the trailer 2021 is going to be the movie
Yeah I can't say that I was surprised that the light show was sooooo political, you would think the government would be trying to calm racial tensions but it seams they want to divide people.
Happy New Year, London. What a beautiful and touching way to ring in the new year, whilst remembering the challenging one we've just left behind. 💕
So cool 🤩🤩🤩🤩 Happy New Year 2021 Everyone
LOVED IT!!!
Far left propaganda from our government. Gives you that sickly feeling, and makes you wanna curse.
Such as shame about the BLM part but other than that, it was good. 😊
I REMEMBER GETTING SO GASSED WHEN THEY SAID BLM 💀
We made it let’s hope 2021 will be good and our lives will be back to normal 🥳🥳🥳
Hearing countdown with earphone... the best countdown i've ever heard
Dystopian, and filled with political propaganda. I couldn't think of anything more representative of the future of this country.
Where Did They Find The Time To Do this
Really Awesome..... Happy new year...... 2021......
This made me cry 😢 So beautiful 😍 Praying for everything to get back to normal 🙏🏻
Gross, the celebration of a defeated people.
Stunning! made me cry!
Amazing
Wow. Stunning fireworks. Happy New year people! ❤️
Happy new year
"This program contains flashing images"  Oh really?
I don't like this marxist ideology rammed down my throat. Defund the BBC...😡😡😡
I cant find right word... Maybe just WOW 😳❤️ HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE 🙏
BLM 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Defund the BBC.
Happy new year everyone!!!
absolutely amazing job you lot, can't describe how good it felt to watch this after what we've been through. anyone who gets angry over this, just aren't worth it
BOOOOOO, Join Patriotic Alternative
Salute to all the NHS works and thanks to all the force's indulge in this this critical and tough time 💪 fighting against Covid....hope this year will bring  joy and happiness and a new hope against the Covid.  Wish u all a happy new year 🎆🎇✨
I see they’re training for their fake invasion
Sack Kahn the wasist anti w hite sod for allowing symbols of Black power to be shown over Our Capital.
I cried watching this... Have a safe, healthy, prosperous, blessed HAPPY NEW YEAR to all! God bless!
Waste of money
I NEVER thought that the firework display at Sydney harbour bridge would EVER be topped,but God was I wrong? Take a bow London! That was immensely stunning! So beautiful and had 2020 in a nut shell! I’ll NEVER forget this! #1 show on the globe!!🔔👏🏻
australia: why can i smell smoke and coulourful gas  london: i-it wasnt us
2021
People with selaphobia have to miss these videos.
Wow this was truly stunning! What a beautiful way to end  a year that has been so hard and emotional for all people on this globe. We can only hope that year 2021 will be full of peace, good health, kindness and happiness for all. Happy New Year from Australia.
Couldn’t help but sneak some BLM propaganda in there could they
Too shame I went to the Big Ben and missed this show which is closer to my house.
BBC korupt 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤬🤮👹👹👹
Whoever organised this years firework. Was shittt arse. They weren't even alll that tbh
Nice of the Great A'Tuin to make an appearance at the end, carrying the Discworld on his back
A meaningful, Inspiration message for New Year 2021..So amazing! Keep safe everyone! Happy New Year to all.
Brexit was there
Remember the virus doesnt effect BLM rioters
Australia’s is better
i swear this firework show was one of a few things that were good of 2020
Super, su
this made me cry wow thx i could not celibrate cause of lock down but wow thx
Wooooooooooo
happy new year everyone🥰 Lets hope its better then 2020😛
Can't we just have some entertainment without a political or virtue signalling message hidden in it.
Truly incredible repugnant propaganda with added shit music.
All lives matter
Cried my eyes out... damn.
Make me cried
how dosen't think this is amazing is a twit
well... I loved the drones. was going well until the bs Burn. Loot. Murder message came on. then stopped watching.
Let me guess 2021 is gonna be worst
Happy new year ✊🏾
This video reminds me of watch dogs legion lol
It was beautiful❤️
good display ... but why are they promoting a Marxist organisation that wants to defund law and order and has been responsible  for riots across the developed world.....    think this kind and thing and Sports really needs to stay apolitical.
we have a choice in life GOD give us free will if we want to take the Covid 19 vaccine,   Luke 10:19 Listen carefully: I have given you authority [that you now possess] to tread on [a]serpents and scorpions, and [the ability to exercise authority] over all the power of the enemy (Satan); and nothing will [in any way] harm you.  1 John 4:4,  "You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world, MATTHEW 28:18-20  And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. , trust in GOD
Rubbish
Sky News put this whole event on mute
I was at home watching this on tv at midnight while everyone was outside setting fireworks celebrating the new year.The fireworks display was so beautiful. The lights were phenomenal and moving. 2020 was such a hard year for all of us. Let’s hope that 2021 will bring back a little normality sometimes happy new year everyone and stay safe.
Bravo!
The BBC has an enormous problem with organised paedophilia. A culture of kiddy fiddling.
Best display so far 👏👏👏
It comes to something when you have to be told to be kind and it has had to become a slogan it should come without saying but it's a sign o the times we need reminding that and black lives matter about time 2021 up year bum
What is the song on 2:43
Happy new year fam it feeps weird we will never forget 2020
Amazing display, shame they included an organisation so divisive as BLM though.
This was lovely and I applaud the creative director for this show.
They really impressed me this year and with the nightingale....
Wow that was amazing
Happy new year London from Philippines 😘🎊🎆🇵🇭
Amazing use of Drones! Happy New Year 2021 to everyone 🥂
If only they could have fireworks without the accompanying explosive sounds........🐶🐱🙉
This has to be the biggest display of wokeness I have ever seen. The BBC is a sinking ship. Cue the escaping rats
Awesome show spoilt by supporting Anti White extreme Racist Group BLM.  There is no place for any racism against any group in this world shame on you.
Commie garbage.
8:52  " we hate all of you stupid humans! " Birds says
2:39 Was constructed in just nine days & now is completely empty :)
It’s so important Mayor Khan managed to get the Black Power fist incorporated into the display. British people need constant reminding that Diversity Built Britain and that the black man now has the whip hand over the white man in England!  “We’re winning, lads!”
BBC oldest and still the best
Let's hope 2021 is better than 2020, have a good 2021 if I never see any of you guys again!
Awesome. Happy New year to all. Thank you London. Praise God
Only Bugmen start drizzling in their gussets to this shit.
Enoch Powell was right.
Celebrating after killing loads of innocent ppl 😉🤣
Absolutely beautiful, well done to all who planned this and made it happen! Happy new year everyone, I hope you all are blessed with lots of laughter and love 💓
A political agenda despised by the masses but loved by the elites.
BLM nonsense
Happy new year to all the prople in the U.Kand the rest of the world 🌎
You gotta b kidding me
This is a celebration of the control london and government and there billionaire mates have over all of us ,,, and you lot bought into it all, , young people especially have had their lives destroyed from a virus that doesnt even touch you,  and you sit back and take it..I dont get it, I'm 49 my life is ruined by these sanctions and this celebration rubs the salt in.
nice little bit of black lies matter indoctrination👎
HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎈🎆🎊
A years worth of propaganda in 10 minutes...
Instead of narrating all the bad stuff. As it's been such a shit year you should of just shown the drones & fire works. The government should of used the money they wasted on this crap & put it towards something more useful! Such as getting cancer patients treatment because they've been ignored because of this virus.
Well done london,nice fireworks display. China is the best,  sad to say
The vaccine will not be forced on the public until those that are willing to take it have been exhausted, then the blackmail will begin. The people running for the vaccine are the ones that can't think for themselves. This so called pandemic will carry on why the dumbed down masses allow it to continue. The end goal is to get the majority of the population vaccinated before more people wake up to the lies and fudging of covid figures, I believe the vaccine has a far greater purpose than preventing covid.
Hopefully 2021 Isn't As Bad😳
What an absolute load of rubbish! Full of Propaganda and bull shit! The worst fireworks ever. Defund the BBC!!!!!
They should do the same thing with the drones every year in London.
Great
🥳 Happy New Year London 🎉 from Canada 🇨🇦
2021
incongruous and divisive. Disgraceful'.
These were such a wonderful surprise to end a very challenging year, very emotional and very moving. Stay safe everyone, wishing you all a better new year
Happy new year
this was 100% not boris's idea
what a waste of money
what an embarrassment
That was a dystopian mess.
Expat in France, tearing up watching this!
Thank you everyone
Shut the BBC Down , Defined this Marxist  racist organisation.
subhanallah, It's only now in 2021 that this so call civilized society has realize that black life matter..
The most disgusting display over our Capital of a fist for BLM black power , violent neo Marxist organisation , incongruous and divisive. Disgraceful'.
I love how we spent millions on a firework display that nobody could see when millions more people have struggled financially this year. Bit of a kick in the teeth if you ask me
We out done self's this time
I love this
well i thought it was cancelled but anyway, cheers everyone have a good one! 2021 is finally here stay strong and best of luck for all!
i loved how they used the drones
I think i have something in my eyes 😭
Where did rishi borrow the money for these fireworks now?
Celebrating  born of NWO ?  No, thanks ! What is the Trojan horse for The Great Reset, huh ? Happy New Year to everyone who woke up and see the truth !!
Beautiful!!
Happy New Year everyone!! We can do it!! You are strong and amazing!! Keep going 💪
best one yet HAPPY NEW YEAR
Bit of a joke celebrating the Nightingale Hospitals when they can't be staffed and are sitting empty.  Still, can't beat a bit of PR, Boris....
why was there no mention of brexit which is far more important and a cause for celebration rather than promoting BLM violence?
stayed up to watch the new year being brought in.......  loved the display last night
where are the people ????
so boring, where are real fireworks?!
The mute one though 😂😂😂
Undertaker 😱😱
Propaganda at its finest.....an absolutely disgraceful cringe fest.....that shit weasel Khan needs to go !
Happy New year 2021
black lives splatter bye bye UK don't ever come back sincerely the EU
Epic
Simply, beautiful... Happy New Year Everyone
Happy new year everyone 🥳🥳 Can anyone tell me what's they playing song with beautiful eagle light?
This year's fireworks were the best one l have ever seen in my last 45 years living here hats off to allow who did this fantastic work
Happy New Year!
Preferred last years, it wasn’t rammed full of propaganda and box ticking.
We will never forget  2020
lights on but nobody home..:(
Vomit inducing
Would have been nice to just see good -old fashioned colourful fireworks without NWO virtue-signalling  propaganda drone displays also lighting up the London skyline.  Please stop subscribing to the BBC!
Happy 2021 don't let covenant teen strike you down we are stronger than the virus together we are stronger
Marxism promotion. You've out done yourself.
Pathetic woke.  Why have it when you can’t go out to enjoy it
Makes you proud to be British
I am so thankful for the help of the NHS staff, but as a Key Worker who’s been working all year throughout this pandemic, I’m disappointed we didn’t get a mention 🙁 nevertheless it was a great display.
Really Emotional. Thanks to NHS. Happy new year all.😍🎆🎈🎇🧨✨🎉🎊  Stay safe. Stop spread...
Happy New year to everyone please stay safe at a time like this
That made me cry I am not in London but London that is so amazing Iam super proud of u my friend lives in London and I want to say to all of u in London u are so talented love u
The Shard givin me star wars lightsaber vibes
Communist garbage!
Why waste money on fireworks when we was also told to staythey could have give that money to the NHS staff at are doing such a good this government needs getting rid of but we've not got nothing to replace it with so disappointed in this
Oh good.  More pushing of the BLM propaganda.   I was expecting this from Sadiq Khan.
"2020 a year we will never forget" Me: no no i want to forget.
Amazing!
Impressive drone fuckery
I hope fireworks get completely replaced by drones in the future! So much more fun to watch, better for the environment, and not upsetting to animals or people with PTSD.  Also I loved this show. Made me proud to live in London.
london always has the best !!!!!
Would have been so much better without the fireworks. The drone light show in itself is incredible
Nauseating
Your the best bbc
10 minuets and 2 seconds of pure psychological manipulation and deep state propaganda. Drilling into your brain with buzzword after buzzword. Waving their disgusting organised staged protest movements in front of you to lure you into thinking everything is random and in connected.
Brilliant 👏  London you never fail.  Happy 2021 everyone and big thank you to our front line workers ❤
I definetly not like to live in London because ill get woke up like every single hour because of the clock tower.Anyway I LoVE this who ever was filming should get the rest of the night and a day sleep!!! :] your welcome.
I came here just to hear I'm muted. Oh and Stormzy. 😌. 2021 may begin now.
Year 2020 Virus Came Out
I can't believe it's 2021 YAY 😁🥳🥳🥳
Congratulations! You just survive in 2020!!
So so beautiful and emotional
It'll take a while to remember it's 2021 when I'm writing the date.
This was gorgeous until they started virtue signalling 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Some people can't recognise propaganda when they see it. BLM is a Marxist organisation, it has NOTHING to do with black people. Not to mention the deification of the health service. Wake up people, be free.
Holy cow that was amazing you guys I’ll that everybody in the world!
omg
A Brainwashing exercise!
HAPPY NEW YEAAAAR
People still living in the past.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 fantastic messages of love & hope ❤ well done 👏 ✔ NHS we love you and all the people who have worked so hard through this ie shop workers , bin men ,bus drivers cleaners just everyone of you and the ones I've missed out , Godbless the world 🌎 & Happy New Year to the World 🌎 ❤
What's the song at 5.19?
I herad just i Irland cvurches  bell ring.
nice
Wowwwwwww
On the internet were saying firework display will be cancelled this year... Wouldn't be better to spent all those money to get more staff in hospitals a specially in a poorer areas of London ? In addition if we thanking should there be thank you for teachers, postman & postwoman, supermarket workers and all those who risk health everyday too & make our lives bearable & normal again ?
Happy new year 💕
Who else came back to watch this again?
5:40 same group that wants to defund the police, knocked statues down and caused millions in damages on property, businesses, cities.. 👎🏻
Happy New year to everyone
our London fireworks always make me incredibly emotional. It's the way the year is summed up so perfectly, and positivity is spread throughout ❤
Cool
Nice fireworks, lose the woke bollocks!
Happy new year to you fram sweden.🤩🥰❤💯💛💥💥💙💜👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Felice Anno Nuovo a tutti voi
London brings us new years along with the new corona virus Lol
God bless the integrative and functional medical doctors and the naturopaths, all the true healers in the world. God please get rid of the drugger allopathic medical doctors who are dysfunctional symptom suppressers and do not focus on root cause if disease and health parameters.
Fantastico ❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍
The set up of the lighting and the fireworks my goodness. How does one get a job in areas such as these! They don't teach you about these types of jobs in school!
Wtf were itv doing watched this and said the lights and fireworks were good.  Mum and dad were so confused itv didnt show anything but car horns
❤❤❤❤❤❤
They had to ruin it with that BLM crap. BLM are domestic marxist terriorist, plain and simple. The BBC will not show the truth of the chaos they caused in US cities. Leaving them as lawless slums with many businesses having to either permanently close or leave. That's not Covid that's BLM. Look at the state of Seattle and many other cities. You wouldnt even visit the places now.
So poignant, so beautiful. Brought tears to my eyes. Such a wonderful presentation to end possibly the worst year ever. I pray for everyone's health & safety in 2021
NHS
Disliked for promoting cultural Marxism 5:40
Lets make 2021 better then 2020
I want to see it live in london someday 🎆🎡🎶🌌🌉🌠 It's my dream ✨  Happy new year from Japan☆
Great way to end and begin again. Thank you London.
crap.
We all deserve a good show once the cov goes and does one! Happy New year all ;)
Awesome 👍
What a load of Bullshit - propaganda at its finest !! I had to switch this shite off !! For a pathetic Scamdemic - Does no one care anymore !!
Very Chinoisie
Music???
This was tastefully done! Made me feel the feels.... Have a decent new year everyone!
The Propaganda is off the charts!
moment before disasters :)
Hopefully 2021 Goes  our way
Amazing
Supporting a bunch of terrorists that want to support the defunding of police, nah you're allright
Love your vids keep up the cracking work
Happy new year 2021 To Everyone🥳 🎆 greetings from Bogor, Indonesia 🙌
Strength, unity and commending to our hero's. The whole world judges the English for their past, but each year we turn to watch, we turn to them ❤️
Proud to be British and proud to be Asian ❤️❤️
Disgusting
thought we were having no firework display
The worst New Year beginning! 2020 Hoax & shut downs & bye bye human civilization!
I absolutely loved this. Made me tear up so much especially Tom Moore’s figure in the lights 😢. Happy new year everybody!!!! 🥰🥰
Lets thanks to all those that did their part keeping society afloat in such daring times. Working to keep others healthy under dering circumstances and at a high personal cost. And to all for just following the rules to protect themselves and others. The worst is not over. So thanks for your ongoing effort and dedication. Happy new year to you all.
One of the best light shows I've ever seen , fantastic laser and fireworks and an even impressively amazing drone display , happy new year everyone 🎆🎉
Happy new year
Happppiiieeee New Year!  Everyone!  Hoping for a good year ahead!!! 🥳💜 This was lit!!!!🎊
I hated the show until David Attenborough came on 😌
Spectacular!  The fireworks, projected lighted imagery & music all working synergistically to capture the zeitgeist.  Commentary/voiceover, particularly NHS gratitude, Captain Tom Moore & closing brought tears.  Exceptionally well-done!  Happy New Year!  🎉🎇
i watched this live yesterday
Disgusting, woke AF, and an utter waste of tax payers money. Sadiq khan needs to be removed, now. This has nothing to do with nationalist values. BLM are a marxist, communist organisation, anyone in their right mind would not support them. Resist the BS and wake up.
HATED it all.. NWO brain washing bull!!
How come their drone signal can go that far in the sky and my bluetooth signal can barely get me from the room next door? 🤔
5:46
DUMB THEY MADE 2021 NEW DAY ABOUT COVID......... TRYING TO KEEP THAT THING ALIVE ARE THEY... GREAT DISPLAY JUST STUPID THEY MADE IT ABOUT COVID!!!!! COVID IS ABOUT CONTROLING THE WORLD POPULATION HUMANS NOT ABOUT A STUPID VIRUS LESS DANGEROUS THEN THE FLU!!!!!!!!! AND PATHETIC ADDING blm to this lol
Happy New year people 🥰🥰🥰🥰🌺🌺🌺❤😍😍😍😍😍
Proud to say best celebration in the world
Amazing! 😍 A blessed 2021 to all of us! 😇💜🎉💕
so much money wasted to push a political agenda.
Ya know what... If people only knew what was else had gone on in NHS hospitals in 2020, they'd freak.  In contrast to good people there was seriously dark bad shit that went on.  Drug addicted sociopathic nurses in the ICU high on amphetamines from the drug cupboard nearly killing patients.  They need to clean that shit up yo.
1:10 Ben is not working properly...
This is the best display I’ve seen from London in years. Whom needs fire works when we have lights and  drones. No more smoke in the air bye bye pollution!!!  Happy New Year All.
So good this year
I like the bit when it says" YOU'RE ON MUTE " lol
Still pushing the racist group blm nice
Amazing!
The lights on the right, how in the world did they do that
Last night on the BBC when Big Ben chimed on the hour  the BBC narrator said "the old ways were now extinct" IF THIS DOES NOT MAKE YOUR HAIR STAND UP TO THE DAVOS NWO plans you must are missing a trick
The use of drones in displays has reset the the bar to a new high
Fantastic display. Very emotional watching.  Xxx
The irony of B.L.M which has created the most division in society I've seen in my entire life then immediately after the lights show "All Together". Stop focusing on race then...
All lives  matter
Tears in my eyes! Just incredible! GOUK!! GOAWAYCORONAVIRUS!! Happy new year everyone! Rock on David Attenborough! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Goodbye UK
lol London done it so good and nobody in London even watched
I'm glad that we can be proud of something in this country - hang onto the message
These fireworks were brought to you by political correctness.
Happy NEW YEARS 2021. Go to Life.
2:13 Just Wanted To Say That Speech Was Soo Powerful Felt Like A Movie Trailer
2021 last hope
Only good part was when blinding lights came on
Happy new year 💐❤️ 2021!
Happy New year!!!!!!! Hopefully 2021 is going to be better!!
Watching from the United Kingdom have a happy new year let’s make this a better place
I am confused. Sadigh khan said we can't afford having a firework. for new year. What is this then?
Round 2
That was lovely!
100% Awesomeness 🔥
All Covid and BLM related, get fucked with your shit display! It wasn't live either, it was pre-recorded a few days ago.
5:11 ""You're on mute!" 😄
RZ
Incredible display! Well done to all involved 👏 the Captain Tom part was wonderful. So many parts amazing. Superb.
Khan's ultra woke fireworks
Thats fantastic!
What a surprise after London fireworks  display being called off... Absolutely beautiful!  Hello 2021!
Phonomenal
It's 2021 and the bbc can still go do one
You can’t beat the Brits‼️‼️💥🍾💯
It's not for Nothing that London is the best place to live . The most welcoming  and diverse City in the world . So proud to be a Londoner!!! Happy new year ! wish you all the best much love and prosperity
Brilliant, such a nice surprise, wasn’t expecting anything but this I feel was really special!  I guess the need to stop people gathering was why we were told there wouldn’t be a fireworks display! I can go with that!
May 2021 be a year in which we all create a better world.... free from COVID-19 , hatred and divisiveness !!!  Amen
HAPPY NEW YEAR2021 TO DR THAIRA Z ANJUM AND ALL LONDON FORM  RAJA ISMAIL
Total waste of money. Happy new year what a joke. I wonder if it will be as happy as last year. Millions of people without jobs, big increase of people dealing with depression,  people fighting over toilet rolls people being dictated to by corrupt governments, welcome to 2021.
I watched the news last night at 10.30 last night in UK, and they made a big deal that there would be no fireworks last night, so what is that all about, I missed all this I went to bed, happy new year, the BBC news are such awful news coverage, all ways has to be doom an gloom.
Real beautiful
✨✨😍😍😍😍✨increíble
Absolutely Without a doubt the best thing I’ve seen all year, light show amazing, fireworks stunning and then the drones WOAH mind blown. Great work and a wonderful way to start the year.
"  I close my eyes and I can see  The World, that's waiting up for me  That I call my own,  Through the dark, Through the door,  Through where no one's been before,  But it feels like Home   They can say, They can say, It all sounds crazy?  They can say, They can say, We've lost our minds,  We don't care, We don't care, So call us crazy  We can live in a World, that we design   'Cause every night, I lie in bed  The brightest Colors, fill my head  A Million Dreams, are keeping me awake  I think of what the World, could be  A Vision, of the one I see  A Million Dreams, is all it's going to take  Oh a Million Dreams, for the World we're gonna make "   - A Million Dreams, sung by ( Fiaz Friderling, sorry did't know how to spell the name )   " The Noblest Profession is the one that makes others happy "  - P.T. Barnum   Again I apologize, for the edit,  but someone was blaring a radio,  with noisy junky music on it,  we couldn't enjoy the fireworks!
Absolutely disgusted with the political bs trying to brainwash people the british are waking up to this bbc
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE!!!!! I HOPE EVERYONE HAS AN AMAZING 2021 🥳🥳🥳🎉❤🙌
Dogshit
Unbelievable! Could they not leave blm out of our nye fireworks!! This is a divisive and toxic ideology perpetrated by a small minority, and has no place in a national celebration!
Happy new year 2021
Absolute shite. I know what Big Ben sounds like and it does not do anything for me.
ok but if they can include that old man for walking why didn’t they include marcus rashford
Amazing !
Shame on the so called Leaders of the U.K.!!!!! Your New Year's will find you Voted out and in jail for your Unconstitutional Tyranny!!!!! Tyrants NEVER lasts!!!! May our all powerful GOD NOW intervene to reveal and destroy all evils at their core roots!!!!! Thank YOU GOD!!!!! AMEN and AMEN!!!!!!)
COVID hasn’t finished yet still getting worse before it gets better
Excellent BBC, what a decent display showing what has happened in the past year and showing us that there is hope.  All take heed form the warnings and let's do our little bit to make mother nature better again. peace 2021
Happpy newww year! This was incredible!
Only the BBC could be involved with using New Years eve fireworks to perpetuate the covid agenda and big up the Marxist under currents !
Propagande spoiled lovely fireworks! 🥺Happy New year 🎉🎊🥳
The absolute cringe of this
It’s not just for new year it’s for the end of the brexit transition
Pretty but too mish mash & pc 🙄🙄  yea for including captain Tom! He was the best bit!
F*** the Police !! 😂💪🇬🇧
2021
totally rubbish and innapropriate. music is horrendous, violent racist BLM shouldnt be recognised, the talking all way through it. whoever organised this event needs FIRED Pathetic. loved sir toms respect though.
Happy New Year 2021
Why did they tell us there isn’t going to be fireworks this year then?
I was so emotional this whole time watching this. you did not disappoint us still. Love you London still
Happy new year 🥳
The synchronised drones were very good but we could have done without the Black Power and Black Lives Matter references.
It’s the first year I’ve never watched this as I thought it wasn’t going on. I feel hurt now 😩
london gave me hope;i love them.
Thank you london for the surprise fireworks. we did not expect this. it was beautiful thank you
Load of shite. Only thanking the NHS?! Absolute disgrace what about Carers? Supermarket Staff? Logistics? That also kept  things going during the "Pandemic"  Silly to think 2021 will be any different. Like everything that happened in 2020 is going to just disappear. Yeah ok :/ more like 2020 repeated.
Race baiting blm rubbish, climate change and The EU. What an embarrassment to this nation
Disliked as soon as I saw the blm and I’m black. Tryna pander to us
where is that place in London exactly?
Outstanding display, and the drone choreo was excellent! Ironic that on the day we leave the EU the clear message was "All Together, Join Together"... Happy 2021 folks.
Great laser lights show and fireworks! Loved Captain Tom and David Attenborough’s messages!
Wonderful to hear a South East London lads song being played in the London New year display, re MNEK.
I've been here in UK for about 12 years now, and this is the Best NEW YEAR DISPLAY I've seen
You awful,hateful,SJWankers.Your not clean your dirty with minority hate FOff London
Amazing! ♥️ The best NYE display we have ever had
Beautiful 🥺🥺
Whatever others can do, The British people can do it better... Love from Bangladesh and Happy New Year ❤️🎇🎆
I thought they cancelled the firework?
....
Little did you know what would happen one month later (I’m from the future).
Wowwww thats amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This made me tear up just beautiful London not always that impressed with our country but we definitely out did everyone last night well done to everyone who choreographed this so proud of england today xx ❤️❤️❤️💖💖💖
Happy new year in london 2021
2:35 song name
NHS, BLM , green planet more indoctrination on New Year’s Eve.... surprised they didn’t tell you to get the vaccine in there too
Happy New Year!
wow this was a great show!!!
Blown away by the drone technology - the whole thing was a masterpiece.
happy new year 2021
Gorgeous
This was beautiful but I swear they were cancelled
God bless Sir Tom 🇬🇧 All Lives Matter 🙌
Thank uk for the NHS
BLM , BURN LOOT AND MURDER.A DISCRACE , TAKE THE KNEE ? ... HOW ABOUT I RAISE MY MIDDLE FINGER.
So beautiful and emotional 😭 thank you for the BLM segment it was so needed especially during these times
Thailand UK Love Together
This made me pretty emotional 😭
HAHAHAHA LONDONISTAN XD
2020 is the trailer of 2021
Fireworks was okay did not think much of the lefty political Nonsense but I have come to expect it from the BBC
This firework tribute made me cry. Thank you to all of these who have been in the frontline fighting the Coronavirus disease, rest in peace  to all of these who lost the battle with the disease and hope god gives strength to the families who have lost their loved ones! I hope that in 2021 there are no more deaths and sorrows🙏🏻🙏🏻. Happy New Year 2021 to everyone who is reading this 🎄🍾🍾🎇🎇🍾🍾Spread love and peace ❤️
Un spectacle toujours aussi magnifique malgré la pandémie actuelle ❤️🎆
Happy new year all. The early few months of 2021 will be tough like 2020 was, but remember, it’s always darkest before the dawn. Better days are coming.
Like 2021 will be any better with their shitty government, tier 5 and 6 and 10 incoming 😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome 😎😎😎😘😘😘😘❤️
Why include black lives matter in this. I know many black British people and they experience little racism if any. This BLM movement is american let’s keep it that way. Black people don’t get repeatedly shot or killed in the UK like America.
The greatest drone show for new normal countdown ! Impressive. Happy 2021 from Bangkok, Thailand 🇹🇭❤️🇬🇧
This was so cringe to watch
Watchdog legion at it best
Watched this last night beautiful
Stay strong people of Britain, don't let hard times get you down 💪  Its okay to be White ❤
I'm honest here, it looks better rthan the one in Dubai
Happy New year
All new songs. All new narratives. Instead of in the past when we celebrated new years by reflecting past things. Okay, Lord BBC. We will kneel before you.
Your on mute was genius
Less dictatorship, less controlling, less conservative ways of thinkings, more open minded, more respectful to others, more tolerate, more acceptable, more choices, less invasion into a ordinary people 's private life
I thought fireworks was canceled so, I off to bed in the morning after midnight.
what a wonderful message.
O M G I've never seen the like Thankyou London my prayers are with you Robert from Canada
Well done London!
If there is one thing  i want too stop in 2021 is this stupid phrase "stay safe".It's impossible to stay safe I might slip over getting out the shower later bang my head and die thing's happen.
Happy New Year From Malaysia!!!❤
I was enjoying that until the BLM came on. BBC, I thought you were non political?
The Morning after Pill Concert from Vienna,words fail me BBC.
what was the point of all of this when you are not allowed to go out and see it talk about a waste of tax payers money
What does a symbol that signifies black power have to do with a New Years celebration? “All together” lol
Actually, I used to like fireworks better than this political drone messaging.
Yh thanks to just the nhs and not everyone else that’s helping run the country
Wow no tengo palabras qué increible produccion 🎉💥🎉💥🎉💥
Fantastic, so different from the usual fireworks. Excellent creativity taking in the most important issues of 2020 in "LIGHTS"!! Wonderful to watch. Thank You...indeed Black Lives Matter, Caring for our Planet & All inhabitants is Critical, our Emergency & Health Workers are Heroes worth celebrating ALWAYS!!
happy new year every one  let all stick together as one because we was put on this earth to  help each other keep our planet well looked after. we are all one  if we all stick together  hope 2021 is a better year from my family to yours x
Would have been better without the Marxist communist imagery.......
So heart warming ❤️
people celebrate new year with their family friend and cousin but me just go outside and just open a light and stare and thinking i was with my whole fam Happy new year 2021
Meh
Thank you lovely city for this message and show for a new year. 🙏🏻🏳️‍🌈🌹
Great fireworks, but for goodness sake, did we need our noses rubbing in all the rubbish from 2020, 'the year I would like to forget", they might as well broadcast "let's all be miserable again"  WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!
Well done London. Xxx😘
the city looks like a funfair and you have to pay to play?it's like going to the casino and thinking about winning at their house?covid 19 has made so many deaths as the bbc says? and you  celebrated? is this how you give  your condolences.bbc1 last night just released a concert not the  fireworks show .....pay tv licence for life is a legal   mafia  system..happy new year.
I thought there weren't going to be any fireworks?! So confused. I missed this last night 😭 Edit: Not my favourite display but the tribute to Captain Tom almost made me tear up... and I love Blinding Lights by The Weeknd
The Best Display you have ever done London.
Fireworks with a message, London was the best I must say. Also less use of fireworks and more use of lightening which is even better.
That was impressive, love the NYE display in our great capital city
Sadiq Khan ❤🙏🏼
This is the best firework show ever. No debate at all. The amount of effort put into this is immaculate , whoever choreographed this deserves a raise 👏👏👏
How shit hahahahahahaha
I was really enjoying this, until a statement was made. About the fascist group. BLM. This is totally unacceptable propaganda. All our lives matter. Stop pumping your shit. BBC.
Dear BBC,  I’m sure your could do better than 720p..
Amazing!! I only had to skip the BLM bit, everything else was fantastic!!
Worst new year eve ever... :/ music didnt work with firewiorks..
What a full load of propaganda tosh. All you people here seem to like being duped.
Wow such a beautiful spectacular show with such an inspiring message. Well done UK. Hands down the best production of all videos I’ve seen from around the world. Happy new year from the USA. May 2021 be better for all of us.
How to ruin a firework display! Burble a load of propaganda crap .... F off BBC.
Mamby-pamby, hoity-toity, up-ya-jacksy mumbo-jumbo virtue signalling cods-wallop!
I hope  2021 is the peaceful year
Not even gonna lie i almost cried.
Can we just appreciate how much thought, hard work and effort has been put in this year’ display.  The fact that the events take place at separate locations makes it impossible for crowds to gather together during the pandemic and then on top of that all the locations have been successfully synced and the live coverage as well! And not to get started on this technological wizardry with the drones - amazing and outstanding performance, backed with meaningful messages!  Thank you for whoever organized this! London has set new international standards once again!
LONDON/DUBAI/AUSTRALIA/NZ are the best
Why is this not in 4K? If there is one video that should not be in 720p, it should be this one, right?
What a disgrace, promoting a Marxist organisation, Mr Khan your days are numbered the silent majority is waking up
Top 1 for sure!
This was an amazing New Year's display especially with those drones which made it seem like Spiderman far from home, the whole display shocked everyone as we weren't expecting this. Well done London
AGENDA 21-30.
Happy Jew Year to you too bbc!
Wow 🖤✨
BLM AS A MARXIST ORGANISATION HAS NO PLACE TO BE GIVEN A VOICE WITH MY TAXES........ALL LIVES MATTER!  SHAME ON AN OTHERWISE BRILLIANT DISPLAY.
Disgusting! They can’t even leave pushing the scam virus out of a new year  firework display. BBC govt propaganda as always.   Vile.  And fake. Like their ‘news’  This is last the BBC will do; they will be exposed by April.
Wow! Incredible
I loved in like some months ago we clapped for the NHS and my family took out whistles and pans it’s was so fun and our house had blue lights on
Happy New year ❤️🎉💗🎉💗🎉💗🎉
Absolutely blew me away, best fireworks display I have seen in a long time and from the comfort of my home. Thank you London, Stay Safe and Stay Strong 🥰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
So WOKE nothing about the UK new beginning but the hand in the sky was great it was not BLM it is what people in London think of Khan, what a Wa.k.r, please fill in gaps.
What a lovely display.. it's a shame my neighbours felt they needed to use their pots and pans 🙄
👌I REALLY love this New Year's welcome 🥳 Stay safe UK 🥰
Defund the bbc
Lets talk about something else for a change...PLEASE
Amazing!
All lives matter they had to bring BLM into it. Old habits became extinct to make way for new ?? Hmmmmmm so is the great reset
All life's matter....
Enjoyed it until stormy  followed by black lives matter fist, turned off then
Beautiful!
THAM YOU NHS 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
I love how 2020 was the year of misfortune and yet has the most amazing fireworks i have ever seen
Wonderful to see the positive messages completely drowning out the negative!!  Keep it going throughout 2021 and beyond, coupled with stay safe and be strong. A huge thank you to all, Happy New Year!!!
Stuff new year it's off to be same old same old
I liked the part where the siren went off at the end :)
this is actually really good
Happy New year
This is what propaganda looks like. If you see it you’ll recognise it. If you’ve fell for it you’ll be angry while reading this.
Was last night fireworks or this is fake news 🤩🤩
Absolutely brilliant.  Best EVER and so relevant!!!   Very emotional.    Well done London.
Uk New year 31th 12 2020 Its the time they left EU
2:50 Wings of Freedom
I MISSED the display but but well done London and God bless all those who lost there lives last year to civic hope this year is a better ONE stay save london
And in-line with Sir David Attenborough’s message at the end there - FFS let’s all stop exploding pretty, polluting sparkles in the air at every celebratory opportunity we get so impressionable people can say ooooh, aaaaah! 🤯🤯🤯
the best ever.  the drones make it look even better
Never felt prouder to be British!  Thank you!
Forget the fireworks 💥 give me more drones! Brilliant 😵😵😵
Nice
imagine raising another races supremacy symbol high above your bughive colony as a means of celebration LMAO. cities are the most disgusting places on earth.
2021 com saúde a tds👏👏👏👏
God David Attenborough got me good.. balled my eyes out at the end 😂😂😂😂😭😭 happy new year ❤️
Thank you BBC!!! Love the Fireworks! Amazing Team work! HNY BBC xoxo :)
Amazing Technology Very Well Made!
Great video and happy new year and stay safe from south wales U.K.
Lindo!! Que 2021 tenhamos saúde, paz e muita fé. 👏 👏 👏
FINALLY
Happy New year to  BBC news.
Beautiful and inspirational.   Well done!  Xxx
Who else stayed up until like 12 at night and just as 00:00 struck people started to go crazy
I can tell that 2021 is going to be worst soon everyone will be chaos riot and evil things coming soon wait and see.
But is It the James hype remix?
I live opposite the o2 and I missed it! I'm so annoyed with myself haha
Happy New Year! 2021 Has Arrived!👍👍👍
I watched up until the Black Panther fist salute shite then turned it off .
Happy pollution
I am watching this from Gaborone, Botswana. Deeply deeply touched by this. Let's make 2021 a happy new year for all inhabitants
Wish everyone in the world peace and overcome this difficulty from Vietnam🎆🎆🎆
Wow super wow 💞💖💝💕💗😱🎆🎆🎆🎆
Idec London smashed it this year
For some most people 2020 has been a bad year but for me it’s been a good year
UK stand upppp 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 👌 🍾🎉🎆🎆🎆🎆
Its a dream come true! Very nice and sophisticated production. Awesome memory to begin 2021!
That was amazing. I love it! Happy new year to everyone ♡
I almost cried to think we made it past another year because of how long it felt.this is a new chapter of our lives, and a happy new year to you all 💖💖
6:54 SpongeBob
well done London Thank you Grazieeeeeee
The drones were amazing!! I think next year should be drones only it would save so much money, reduce pollution, not scare the crap out of wildlife, pets and people with pstd 😁
So a virus has to happen for there to be a decent firework display 🤣
the best way saying thank u to NHS
Ab kahan gaye woh log jo diwali pe fireworks jalane pe sawal uthate hai bade environmentalists bante hai abb kidhar hai😀😀
Omg I've just cried through the whole thing! Stay strong everyone we've got this 💪
By 2024, this is how American political leaders will be presented for each of their speech introductions
Lost me at the terrorist BLM bag of shite pandering punks
2k dislikes from the All lives matter community
Happy New year ? who can believe that being a  year older makes you happy and with these particular circumstances.
Happy New Year to everyone!!!
Happy New Year’s Eve
2021 is gonna be pog
Shameful display of virtue signalling. And a horrible waste of taxpayer money when so many have lost jobs and had business shutdown and are worried about how to afford basic necessities or if they are even going to be available.   T o n e   d e a f   &   o f f e n s i v e .
This was the first ever fireworks display which made me tear up. Well done London on an amazing display 🥲
Beatiful show. Happy new year ❤
God bless UK.
Also, did anyone hear the siren in the last 2 seconds? Part of the production? Or did it just happen in the background at that moment? ..... odd!
Amazing!! Finally off the bloody wheel!!
They used a BLM fist for crying out loud. They're supporting a group who can't do basic statistics, deify criminals, seek the dissolution of the family and hate the law as well as white people. Next time for balance put up a swastika.

Very great! Happy New year 2021.!
Poor white kids lives matter
I really liked the message apart from the *blm* think that just ruined it for me but I loved the fireworks and the other things
I wish London all the best in the new year!!!I miss London so so so so so so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow
Very good until the BLM fist was once again forced down our throats
Nice London and nice way to starting new year 2021
White lives don't matter though do they?
Out of the world
Terrible propaganda, I'm ashamed of the response to the virus. The capitulation of the population to the demands of our overlords has been an abomination. The criminal activity of those overlords must be prosecuted. They are coming to take your freedoms and you're smiling and clapping. WAKE UP
It is like a Fortnite live event
Build a wall around London the crap needs keeping inside of it, diversity is destroying our country, BLM, burn loot murder, crap lives don't matter
3:06 name music please
We love UK🤩
Pathetic in more than one way. Also, how many pensioners could have had their winter power bills paid with what it cost to put on this propaganda show?
Pure political propaganda by Khan , disgusting.👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
It's beautiful!😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️I'm favourite country It's London !I love you so much!Happy New Year 2021!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Amazing. London the Best ❤❤

A great combination of fireworks and drones ! What a great performance ! London you rock ! All the best wishes for 2021 from the Netherlands
I never want to forget It 💖💖💖💖💖
Incredibly proud to be from the Uk 🇬🇧
this is how to celebrate a new year... not just fireworks but with a clear message to all and to the world. this is more entertaining. i salute who had this idea even with the pandemic that is going on in the world. bravo!!! 2021 here we go!!!
Hang on a mo. We stayed up last night and watched sky news and the BBC. Not a mention.  How could sky news missed this
Wow. This fills me with so much pride!!
Ok that blue bird was soo amazing!!!
The daffy australia rapidly surprise because ball secondly bore pace a present train. vast, plausible division
happy new year❤️
Thx government for this amazing display
Why bring politics into New Years celebrations?
😭❤️🔥This is just touching
Why do people think the arena it was at is the O2 it’s Wembley.
Is it just me, or did this whole thing give anyone else the creeps... cold as ice?? ... very very weird, and NOT in a good way....
Happy New year 2021uk
Happy new year
This look's so cool
well I know this was suppose to be a smaller display than last year but to me I think this one was better than last year version. But come on, no mention of Tiktok!
Who was here live i was
Incredible display from London, take a bow to whoever choreographed that! the message is clear, we will fight and get through this together as one strong community!
All lives matter and the money could have been better spent helping small businesses survive, hospitality and feeding the children
Ola falo diretamente do brasil e desejo a todos vocês um feliz ano novo e que suas familia estejam confortadas, porque 2020 foi um ano muito dificil. Feliz ano novo.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME THEY GOT ME WITH THE TURTLE
Happy new year london🇬🇧🎄🎆🎇✨😀
So beautiful 💖 I don’t understand how anyone could dislike this
This shat all over times square.... I mean the kia advertisement.
Big Ben fantastic to hear it again
BROOO THIS IS BETTER THAN NEWYORKS... Wish I was there
Well country got no money now 🤬
Happy New World Order more like.
So no one noticed anything a bit strange?? No symbology or anything? 😂
That was just incredible congratulations London, what a year 2020 was goodbye 👋🏻 and hello 2021 let’s make this year a better one for all of us xxx ❤️
Using drones to form militant BLM fists?!!! 🤮 Totally inappropriate.
Watching from Sydney happy New year 🥳
Like it, but politics has no place in new year fireworks, all lives matter.
Good display full of very provocactive liberal messaging. A disappointment.
Brilliant
Love the use of drones and lights instead of loads of fireworks, makes a change to the smoke display from last year.
Sana all HAHAHAHAHAH
Wow
Wow... this really makes up for the stupid lockdown...NOT. Get faaaaarkt
What an amazing display. It made me cry last night with pride at the topics they chose to highlight- the NHS, BLM and then that turtle. It was beautiful!
The Turtle Moves!
FILTH
Why did this make me tear up.? Oh because it was amazing
I think it should of said "all lives matter"
Gay
where the hell is that voice coming from
Brilliant display,,sorry to say that we will never act together,,the odd few elite will join forces and try to do the right thing,,the world is a massive gift box that us as humans always keep taking and taking the presents it gives us,,and sad to say us as humans never ever give back...and the world only has so much to offer before it runs out of presents..
Beautiful thanks for this
Don’t usually cry when I see fireworks but well done London happy 2021 everyone
(:!
Goodbye 2020.. you'll be known In the future as the year when the humanity seen the biggest scam ever
I would’ve enjoyed this much more if there was no political references in this
BBC 1984 propaganda machine! What about 140 million lives in the 3rd World starving now because of this plandemic! Don’t they matter?
Happy New Year people 🎉 Also what are the songs used in this??
The light and drone technology is awesome - next year just scrap the fireworks and keep the rest 💥 🎆
Welcome to 2021
A year of hope and grace. God is love
This was better then any firework display before . The drones was amazing
Amazing, beautiful messages.
I want to congratulate who did the wire lights, me and my family found it the best show yet. There have been some real heroes this year, they deserve to be recognized.
Disgrace bringing politics and Marxist salutes that have divided all of us, Sadiq khan must go absolute idiot of a women .
Welcome to the Brave New World
We still managed to pull something off. Has to make you feel proud
This brought a tear to my eye
A few lights and people crying ?  Get real ! You should be crying the way the state of the world is . A few drones  lit up , the same technology is getting used  to take away our civil liberties world wide . O but we have got a light show🤣
Fireworks polluting our environment, no problem here’s David Attenborough to distract you.
The NHS are dancing narcissists, BLM are an anti white gang, and last but not least the Biased Broadcasting Corp. To hell with you all.
Amazing
Fire works should have been banned in December. The army should have been patrolling the streets.
They ruined it with the blm shit.
Im Crying
Act like it’s a movie! Make a bad joke out of the world falling apart! I believe the world has changed forever and we won’t live to see it the same way again! China number#1 so sad!
I usually don’t get emotional watching the yearly firework show, but this one definitely hits all of us.
7:06 gta6
Was ok till they became woke , how about a big union jack in the sky 😡
What a waste of money, yet again the this is not representative of the people. The silent majority are awake.
most beautiful fireworks and display i have ever seen. some messages could be toned down so as to bring everyone together but it was still very captivating. best one out of all this year 2021
Absolutely incredible! Filled with hope and love just what we need to start the new year thank you!!
Вы,!,-,лучшие!!!!!-,спаааааасиба
Amazing 👏🏽👏🏽 watching from Kuwait 🇰🇼 😍 happy new year and I wish you the blessings of 2021 if you are reading this 🎉 ✨ 😊
2021 2022 sera comooooo será que será realizado algum sonho as coisas vao volta ao normal
I love London,  happy new year!!2021!! Beautiful!!!
England is the only country that can do new years Eve the best!!
Conditioning the sheeple to the new norm and the great reset, how sad
The only thing I really didn’t like in this display was the blm fists that is racist
Amii zing
Yes 2021
Happy new year xx
Happy new year from philippines! 🇵🇭  I love the drone show! 🤯
Yaaaaaasssss london is by far the best fireworks I’ve ever seen ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
😭
As a spectacle, top marks, but the BBC has become a Covid/Great Reset propaganda machine.
❤️
Loved every minute of it. Best Ever🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Eco lights? Check. Flashy fireworks? Check. Funny jokes? Check. NHS appreciation? Check. TikTok songs? Check. David Attenborough? Check. BLM? Check.
Wasted taxpayers money on this crap when we are already four trillion in debt ridiculous.
Happy New year 🎉🎈❣️🎉.👍💗🤟
This is wonderful!
cool show, but we need 1080, more classics, without this rap and other shit music
too many sheep still.
No BBC all lives matter!
Who went to watch this? I wasn’t allowed
Strange the BBC is not celebrating brexit or even reporting that we have left the eu for good
No fireworks for Brexit but you'll support racist movements with outlandish displays? You should be ashamed.
Why on earth did they not properly play Auld Lang Syne?? That is the most traditional song to play at least once during the entire display. It was a very nice use of lights and fireworks but complete propaganda and division of many. For a start, there's a whole list of issues that was not mentioned at all or acknowledged. But what's new? Many of us are hugely ignored throughout the year all the time, so not utterly surprised to see such selfishness even for an event that is usually dubbed "the greatest show". Never in my life have I missed the New Years Eve celebrations, but now I am glad I didn't stay up for this tat. Nice display but awful messaging. Let's hope they get it right for 2022!!
Absolutely loved this it was Amazing!!! The fireworks, music choice was perfect, the words spoken and the light show was phenomenal. Well done and thank you thourougly enjoyed it.
Happy new year 2021 and stay safe that's amazing Mashallah

Is that the guy with me to become resistant video and read it at the red guy with glasses on as white skin
Ladies & gentlemen what Polishing a turd with a fancy light display & a shed load of fireworks looks like.
All lives matter!,, I 30
A big hug from Holland. Stay safe everyone around the world and take care of mother earth. Love
🇬🇧👍👍👍👍👍🐷
Best celebration I’ve ever seen ... Thank you 🙏 Happy New Year !!!!
Aww am teary eyed 👍🙏❤️
Why spoil it all by bringing blm into a fabulous display.    WAKE UP.,!   WE ALL KNOW,!     I watched the Edinburgh drone display and it was beautifully droned.      I just found it depressing and definitely snp .         Happy New Year and let’s get the vaccine into every one  living here
I came to watch fireworks and got propaganda instead
Love how they completely bluffed everyone and comepletely switched up
So much negativity on here and lies about this bullshit new world order. It doesn't exist. This is a message of hope
Amazing , innovative and uplifting. No going back to just fireworks on the south bank. Well done to all concerned .
Happy New year
The drones were a good choice. They spread good messages and all in all looked amazing.
Fantástico!
Covid will end soon!
Anybody seen those hundreds of poor birds desperately searching a way to escape the cruel fire works that hit their habitat at mid night.
Happy New Year everyone ❤️
this felt more emotional to me than any other years fireworks. well doneGreat Britain
Incredible firework and very strong message to England's population. Thanks to NHS and all the departments,  who stand up with us in this tough time.
👏👏👏👏👏Standing ovation every year...Happy New Year 2021 to our British friends across the pond. 🇺🇸🇬🇧 Amazing & Spectacular display that truly captures the feeling of peace and hope one gets from ringing in a new year. 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉✉️
Amazing view, happy and healthy new year 2021 all
Wow
Happy New Year to you all lovely people.

Happy new year. Fire work is very good to see and music and voice is also very good.
Best ever one David Attenborough made this !!!!
God wins in the end
best fireworks for 2021!
❤️❤️❤️
I dont know why they had to use it as a platform to promote the marxist political movement of BLM
So sad to see our beautiful city so empty, its feeling more like Pyongyang each day.
Absolutely incredible display, probably the best new years display I've ever seen. Well done to those who Absolutely smashed it
Wow.. That was amazing. That drone tech is dope. Thanks to our great politicians here in Germany we had noting.
The BIGGEST & BEST LIE to END 2020! There will be NO FIREWORK SHOW! UK
That was awesome. Amazing.
Happy New Year to you all guys!
Happy New Year to everybody! Let 2021 be a year of hope, healing and rebirth!
Quiero nacionalidad británica
Why so many negative ignorant down  finger . It was such a surprise done very beautifully . Loved the lasers combined with fireworks  . Uk has gone out of EU with a huge bang great show .
I cried when I saw the fist of communism
Amazing. This was so different from all the other years.
I am proud for the UK’s firework. Even I am a PRC student who study in the UK
God Always london in the top I love the creativity well done London
Amazing 🥳
The lively kenya syntactically whistle because doctor partially sniff after a eatable record. robust,  fresh zoology
Im a covid nurse, and this made me cry. 🥺😢
Well done! Peace and health to everyone ! Happy 2021.
Incredible Happy New year to you all ❤️
2020.  The year of The Lie.  Nauseating to watch this emotionally blackmailing calculated psy op summed up so calculatingly.  Who gave permission to use Bowie at the beginning???  He would have been horrified.  Why the footage of that "white elephant" the dome a travesty inflicted at great cost by the high priest of doom TONY BLAIR. Very amused to see Tower Bridge put to creative use.  With any luck all those behind this murderous regime stretching back decades will soon be taking up residence nearby.  Traitors.
That was beautiful!
TikTok songs lool
Wooohooo no more EU for UK!
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE
Feliz Natal! 🥳
Happy 2021 everyone, please stay sensible, covid-19 isn't over by a long shot, but most of all BE KIND😁❤️
WOW
And last but not  least bye bye EU :(
It just hit 12 am for me
HAPPY NEW YEAR MY PEOPLE I BORN IN MANCHESTER WISH THE BEAUTIFUL WISHES FOR ALL US ANIMALS HEATH BLESSES JOB  JORJA HAYLEY PATTIE DESKIN GIBB
The best I ever witnessed. Who ever choreographed this one should get medal for his creation.
I watched this and cried,happy new year!🥳🍷
Wow such an amazing firework display from my city this year . Very impressed . Great start to 2021
The Great Reset is in full flow. Your way of life and rights were confiscated and rewritten in less than a year. Welcome to the new dystopia
Awww lovely brilliantly made 👍👍👍😢🙏🙏🙏
Amazing...Well choreograph and most specially the message.
London you smashed it!!! Awesome show, thank you xx
Covid vaxx scam garbage
Such a wonderful display :) Happy New Year.
Beautiful n sad simultaneously
I took at nap at 11:20 and at 12:00 I woke up thinking it’s a bomb bruh fam lol
Happy New Years!! 🍾🎊🍷🎉
it was good until the BLM shit ....why do they have to get political ....ooohhh i forgot it is London ....they dont think like the rest of the uk
Perfect, humbling and certainly how to set the stage for the New Year!  A heart warming thank you and huge thank you to all!  Just incredible!!
Now that’s one expensive show. That’s a lot of drones!
"Woke" lies and bullshit from the BBC - the enemy's instrument of state propaganda. DEFUND THE BBC! CANCEL YOUR LICENCE FEE!
Fake and gay and full of bullshit lies
That was wonderful. I loved it.
Disgraceful support and promotion of BLM. A divisive and Marxist activist group.
The prides off London
This is shameful proganda and most people making comments  have obviously been conned
Is this fake as there's no news coverage of it happening?
Weldone London
be strong London its okay 💛
Очень хорошо! Зрелищно!
I was getting bored of the London Eye fireworks, over recent years. This was a fresh display over North Greenwich 02 arena and Tower Bridge/London Bridge.
How did they do the nhs and hearts like the sky just doesn’t do that and like the tower that makes a spinning circle in the sky
"ONE WORLD ".
Amazing.. shame it had to have BLM rising above the dome.!!
Anything with David Attenborough involved is beautiful
Drones and the shows was amazing.... awesome, whoever put this together just truly a beautiful sight. Love, hope to all 2021! We will get through his!
First comment in 2021 01-01-2021
10:02 am -- January 1st 2021 Best ever -- why am I crying? From Lockdown Brighton 🌈 UK take care & be well y'all 🙏🏼🌹🙏🏽 I ❤️ BBC!
I agree with mostly everyone, the technology was great.  Although the NLP at the beginning about old habits becoming extinct is unnecessary and worrying.  Also BLM fist....really?  Concentrating on what makes us different is not progress.  A reflection on our shared hopes and dreams for 2021 would have been uplifting.  But like everything the media and the technocracy puts out at the moment it’s just follow our narrative via propaganda.  It’s a shame.  Even this celebration seemed hijacked.   Sorry for the negative but something weirds going on and this coming year does not seem like it’s going to be any different.
4:55 MS Teams call ?
Is it me or was Big Ben clock about 10 seconds (here or there) out with its chimes?.
HAPPY NEW YEAR!
As said, thank you NHS heroes!!!
Really spectacular and moving. Was this done in secret? As I know obviously they weren't mass crowds for fireworks this year
Amazing so amazing like i am amazed to see this .
Wish politics wasn’t forced into it. Because when it is, it divides people when they’re supposed to come together.
I was really enjoying the show until the raised ‘Black Lives Matter’ fists appeared.   Go stuff yourselves -  I ain’t applauding a bunch of commie goons!    Are you fools, or what???
London STILL managed to pull it out the bag! 🍾
Amazing ❤️
Happy new 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣1️⃣ everyone and a good year :D
NO One Does New Year Quite Like Us Brits! This was insane!   I hope 2021 brings everyone alot of happiness And this year is the beginning of hope and Positivity   Stay safe everyone have a great year 🙏
Pray more humanity, more mercy, more transparency, more justice, more free of choices, less corruption, less blackmail, less crimes, more integrity, more equality, more trustworthy, more peaceful environment, less bullying, less picking on each others, more efficiently
Spectacular show of wokeness
Holy heck in a Handbasket. Wow, Wow, WOWZA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Respect from across the pond. My British friend always says, " You Americans like all your fanfare and Pomp and Circumstance Ra, Ra. Us not so much."  Yeah, famous last words, Huh Buddy?   This show was amazing. The beginning was very Dr. Whoosh. Then, Bam, shout outs to heroes. Well played London!!!!! I loved the blue bird. Wow just wow! My jaw is still on the floor. Gorgeous! Happy New Year's to our original family.
As we enter 2021 let us be grateful that by the grace of God we are still here while many did not make. We feel for their loved ones.  Let us stand firm in our Lord Jesus Christ.  He is coming back soon!,
Without a doubt the best new year display I’ve ever seen. So much better than just letting off a ton of fireworks, it also reminded us of what a tough year this has been but celebrating it too and looking forward.
Now we can say a nightingale do sing in Berkeley Square! It’s a New year miracle!
of course the last thing you hear is a police siren...2021- surveillance state level unlocked.
This year gone quick but the nhs have sacrafised there life’s for us rip heros
Remarkable! Thank you from the USA where all we got was a clock saying kia!  This is awesome!
Wish i could be there
0:57  undertaker's entry
Can believe they didn't put the most important message up STAY HOME   PROTECT LIVES  .        So stupid
who is watching this in 2021?
Why they said it didn’t have fireworks before? I miss it so much...
Rip
สวยงามค่ะ
2020 may be gone but we do not forget those who lost their lives during the pandemic and we thank the nhs who tried to save those lives whilst risking their own   Thank you 2020 but you are now gone let's welcome 2021
So much for this New year's fireworks display being cancelled
Absolutely wonderful, thank you!
What a pathetic “illuminating”  show. ALL LIVES MATTER. Not just asian and black minority. Stupid BBC peace of fu€king shits. You are funded with our money. You’re public money. Not the “government”. You should stand by our side. Small and medium sized businesses. I finish because is enough. You get me
Wow! And they say the creative arts is a low skilled job 🙄 this is phenomenal! Well done to the team who organised and designed this, well freaking done!
Rip the hero’s
There was much better around the world imo. This felt just very meh. Disappointed however it should never have been put on in a tier 4 area anyway it encouraged people to go out. Overall not great display the fireworks seemed off kilter and badly done aswell.
I am not even british and i am proud of UK for this
Awesome! 😍🎊 Happy New Year to the UK! May 2021 be filled with laughter, love, peace, prosperity and happiness! 🥂✨
Can’t watch this bs
This is unreal the time and everything that’s been put into it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2020-1
Happy New Year London
BLM bullshit blasted over the sky and nothing about Brexit, nice to know that even a firework display can be heavily left biased
Amaziiiiing
Absolute hero’s worst death toll in world
Beautiful
Happy 2012
nice
I didn't like the black lives matter section , that says to me that other lives don't matter, when they do
Everything Cool until the BLM thing
The “you’re on mute” joke took it over the top
never knew that ppl liked my dad that much
Dumb this time with corona narrated
Apart from showing support for the BLM hate group it was pretty good.
Thank you happy new year
Covid obedience? Check.  NHS worship? Check.  BLM support? Check.  LGBT mention? check.  Climate alarmism? Check.  Yup, this is 2020 propaganda.
just wathched others from around the world, londons is by far the best
" Happy new year "
Phenomenal

NO CUPY RIGHT
Well done, and well said. Love from the US
9:40 Yeah with tons of bloody fireworks!!
720p in 2021? This is not a good start.
A spectacular light show! Amazing what God inspired man to create.
Missed this. Thought there was no display lol
Stunning!!!🇬🇧♥️🤩
Great piece of propaganda - can't let an opportunity like NYE pass by without hijacking it for political purposes. Objective 1- normalise the New Normal. Tick. Objective 2- Showcase World Economic Forum's "Great Reset'. Tick. Objective 3 - Turn the UK into a dystopian USSR / N Korea / 1930's Germany hybrid. Tick.  Objective 4 - convince the public that they are inherently racist and destroyers of the environment. Tick. We couldn't even have a drink with each other this NYE and instead we are subjected to this infantilising and patronising messaging on the TV. The lack of resistance to this obvious social engineering is dismaying. Perhaps the people deserve their tyranny. Join together, recognise and fight fascism, give us our lives back. Happy New Year!
Thank you
I don't see the point of celebrating because covid will still be around and well have a bad priminister to replace borris
Every country in the world now working out the technology so their firework displays from now on can emulate this, Bloody well done London!!!
I’m so glad I don’t pay the licence fee for this woke rubbish
Amazing, loved the drone light show better than the fireworks. 👏
Happy new year
The disagreeable ticket perplexingly pour because bladder feraly delight inside a motionless jennifer. disastrous, slippery freighter
I love this. Drone art. May I was there
Without propaganda the show would be great.
Why ruin it with woke propaganda? London needs a new Mayor - fast
Very bad👎
An upgrade compared to the fireworks from last year The drone technology and the fireworks were amazing. And a powerful message. THIS is how the UK should bring in the new year
👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🥂
5:08 - 5:15 why did I laugh
Hello 720p.
This has to be the best thing the BBC has put out this year 👍
Wow! I just missed to see the London Eye.
Happy New year.
Happy new year❤️❤️
Whilst Feeding Fear to the Masses And keeping you locked in your house like A Prisoner 👈 Subliminal Brain Washing from The BBC 🤦‍♀️
Brilliant  show
How beautiful to recognise our wonderful NHS staff, 😊
is blm message dedicated to covid-19?
Happy New Year 🎊🎉Stay safe people! Just love the London Bridge ,it’s a refreshing sight as always 😳
Wow amazing..
Thank you London, and Happy 2021 New Year!❤️
Plus Meilleurs vœux pour cette nouvelle année à toi et toute  ta famille
Thank you for the BLM message! ❤️❤️❤️

David Attenborough lecturing about the planet. Well stop wasting electricity!!
Never been more proud to be brittish...its our way to care for one another and this just made me cry so much...happy tears they did and incredible job with this given the dark times we are going through....happy 2021 guys!!!!
How sad to see political messaging come into something as non political as ringing in the New Year. Only the woke BBC!
Happy new year everyone
Well done london
I wish corona virüs is end
The faint sound of sirens at close of fireworks, rounding up the onlookers! I'm ex-Waterloo, Lambeth. I would definitely gone out to watch this year... instead, peaked early, was sober again by half-seven & went to bed early. Happy 2021!
Happy new year to every one
Solute NHS
hm.. haut mich jetzt nicht so vom hocker 😐
Woo super
Why can't my countrie do this☹️☹️☹️☹️☹️
Wow! Wow! and Wow!!!!!! Amazing!!!!  Best one ever ....
Happy New Year !
I never thought it would be possible
Fantastic show as always! Happy new year everyone. Stay safe! ❤️
It's beautiful.
PROUD TO BE BRIT|ISH
Fantastic as usual ☺️ Stay safe ❤️😙
Still Good Happy New Year !!!!  2021 a year of Change
See they got the Diversity and BLM in.  Just for once can we forget colour and conflict..
Fantastic,
Woke
What is this rubbish, cringeworthy monologue over it? And why are they promoting BLM, a Marxist organisation that smashes up people’s businesses and wants to defund the police?
London take the medals this years never seen anything like that most beautiful!! All over we can make it gather and we will happy new year to the world from New York!!🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
London always does a good job on New Years
London always number 1 celebrate fireworks, but this year we can’t go outside for celebration new year’s just stay home very sadly
This had me strangely emotional! This was better than the normal fireworks display I thought. The drone display was awesome. Ah 2020 was crap in so many ways, but we also achieved so much too. Just need to make sure we don't lose touch with each other and stick together over the coming year. Happy 2021 all 🤙
Hiiii
best one ive seen so far
Black love don't matter all love matter thank you and nhs have duck up save covid
2021 happy new year UK and the world
Just wonderful, well done for keeping it a secret ♥️
I have fully cried every time I have watched this so far. must be getting old 🤣. But there was lil old me thinking our government was all bah humbug, then saw that many people had come together at 2am on several mornings to create this (live near Wembley and remember saying wow, someone's having a good firework display 😳) and then just dropped it at midnight when we have all been feeling pretty low... It made me really emotional, a very tough year, and its not over yet, but sir Tom was there, and then the dreaded you're on mute, a proper roller coaster of emotions. thank you to EVERYONE who made this happen... made me proud to be British even more so than usual. Happy new year everyone. from London, UK 🇬🇧 xxx
I am so happy and blessed to see and feel the message behind this. I love you London😍
Acknowledging black lives matter and lgbt+ good on them
BLM is a political organisation - Tax Payer’s money was used to promote a racist Marxist organisation.
Just Incredible,Actually many many respect for all of NHS heroes.
A propaganda light show.
Happy new year 2020 was a rubbish year but 2021 will be a better year xx stay safe.
WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD. There is no way back. Bye bye past.
Absolutely wonderful, what a magnificent display. Happy New Year to everyone and let us hope we will once again be able to hold our loved ones in our arms.
Idk whats the music 7:28
We maid it guys 2020 is over it is in the past I wish you all a happy new year. New year fresh start to everything we are now an independent country.
Luxury watching comes from luxury country  i loved this luxury still end i wish habby new year 2021
Happy new year 🥳
Happy lockdown in ireland. Ffs.
Thank you for that beautiful blue eagle.  Americans love the British!
Happy new year
Hahaha Hehehe = COVID-15 You're on mute
Would have been great had they not talked about Covid the entire time. What is it about liberals that make them concentrate on gloom and doom all the time? That was a rhetorical question.  It is done to keep you citizens from thinking you can’t achieve anything without the help of the government. It keeps them in power!  It’s all sadness and strife with liberals!  Make your own destiny! Don’t count on the government to make your dreams come true! All those taxes do is make the politicians and all their cronies filthy rich while you live on the dole they decide to give you.  What a beautiful show ruined by those pesky politically correct jackasses who could give a shit about you, only your vote!  How much has Black Lives Matter given to England? What has changed? Notice how all the protests have stopped in the U.S. once the election was over? Don’t you get it? “Vote for us and we’ll stop the violence.”  Every four years, a race war is waged to get folks to vote for Democrats and then afterwards they never do a god damned thing to help. BLM was established in 2012. Why are we still back at square one? The simple answer is, BLM is a Marxist group that uses a name that is sure to emit emotion. The name alone evokes passion and if you disagree with them, you are a RACIST! One of the worst words anyone wants to be called. But BLM has no intention of helping Black people. They want to destroy freedom. They want to destroy the American dream. Think about it. Since 2012 and Trayvon Martin, What has BLM actually done with the billions of dollars they’ve collected? Why are we STILL calling Black people victims? Why do we have this race issue every four years? Don’t you understand? Come on, people. Look up Stalin and the term “useful idiot.” Many of you fall into that category... Happy New Year! I hope you all wake up before all of our freedom is taken from us while you ooh and aah over a light show...
This was just outstanding. The year recap, the positive vibe and the hope looking forward.  The only issue was the amount of fireworks that subdued the green earth message.  😅 May 2021 be your happiest year yet everyone!
Thank you NHS heros
Happy New Year! 🎆🎆🎉 Greetings from PH!

Celebrating the demographic with the highest knife crime and homicide rates in the UK
Did not see this last night
The synonymous lamp really decay because hall ironically colour an a tricky cheek. public, loud discovery
This was a message!!! Thank you and it's what we all need right now instead of just a another fireworks display  <3

Beautiful 🤩 Thank You 🙏 from Alabama USA 🇺🇸
More covid bs , what a waste of money when so many have lost their jobs due to this government’s lies
Happy New year ❤️🇬🇧
London Smashed it. I don’t leave a comment usually but after a few damp squids compared to Sydney Edinburgh Brandenberg gate London Smashed it best in the world by far original hip and uplifting. Made(n)England proud the way it should be. Finally a return on money invested  company who arranged deserves a bonus and thank you. Black lives  fist lighting up London sent out a message of how things London England UK should be. Shout to New Zealand theirs was second in my list  that country seems in a blessed bubble  mayb it’s their pms actions. Improvements fireworks louder and rainbow track accompanied by NHS rainbow with words NHS excellent well thought mute when Big Ben gongs. Smashed it uplifting best of 2021 end racism hate good luck ( Does it. Need to be commented on that GP’s let side down in Main bunkered themselves in  not front line at all need a pay cut their massive pay rise last decade not deserved  not fair on nation relook at their power ‘ to help they hid away’ do something and never again the way media and government gp’s abandon care home’s & elderly at start left old to die disgrace of of the decade take note Boris thanks capTom not forgotten)110.786
It is nice seeing something different. This is beautiful.
Happy nye London 💕💕🍾
The bbc has dropped the licenses fee 🙌🙌🙌
Wishing you a happy New Year 2021  Angela Merkel,in her 16th New Year's Eve address as German Chancellor,said as much. " Never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy. And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism,looked forward to the new one with so much hope,"  Germany banned the sale of fireworks  DR.MOHAMMAD LAEEQUE NADVI Ph.D. (Arabic Lit.)

What a memorable celebration! Tears in my eyes to see wonderful gratitude and unity. Happy new year to all.
Shame the bbc added that shite over  the sound
Extraordinary, finally a Son et lumière that takes full advantage of the London skyline... this is the model for the future. However, as a student of politics I was a bit confused by the use of the Black Power Salute?? This is most commonly associated with communism, neomarxism, extreme far left ideology and Black Separatism or Black Nationalism .... still trying to understand this part of the message ?
"ALL LIVES MATTER" enjoyed it until it became political no mention of the UK bright future out side of the EU a typical London display for the woke Londoners
Amazing 🎆👏🏻
If I'm having a bad day, I'm definitely coming back to this😍❤
WHAT is there to celebrate? Record infections and deaths? Exit from Europe? I despair.
this is better than the normal ten minutes of fireworks london normally gets it proves less is more.  the drones are a nice touch,
Absolutely spectacular and touching at the same time !!!!!!!!!!! Brought a tear to my eye. And btw..  this so called "toned down" New Year's Eve fireworks display was a million times better than the disastrous FAIL of last year's.. just saying.  😁😁
Happy new year folks.x
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE!! MAY ALL YOUR DREAMS & WISHES COME TRUE. MAY THE UNIVERSE WORK IN YOUR FAVOR & HELP YOU ACHIEVE EVERYTHING YOUVE EVER WANTED♥️🔥🙏🏼
Help! Im drowning in a pool filled with my tears.
London takes the cake this year for their stunning fireworks!
awesomeness🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆
Hello
Omg this was amazing
Amazing ❤️🤗💕
wow.....London  amazing  as  always
U.K. wins. Best fireworks celebration by far! Sydney was 2nd. Although Dubai's building was out of this world, the fireworks themselves look like something off an old 1980 fireworks stand. Even Nagano's short display, which feature newer types of shells was better.
Welcome to Russia 1960.......
I’ve never cried on New Years but this year was so difficult i cried 🥺💔
This welcoming of 2021 from the BBC. This light show and the Fireworks were just spectacular!
Why as a tax payer am I forced to pay for EU symbology and Racist 'power salutes'.  Defund the BBC!
More BLM bullshit, no wonder there has been a mass exodus of people cancelling their TV licenses.
*POLITICAL PYROTECHNICS*                              Not Arson on Acid  ==>Bad Acid on a Bad Trip
My god, the moment when the nightingale was lit up - ASTOUNDING!
Happy New Year, May GOD Bless Everyone!
Sky news are reporting that there was no fireworks last night ????
The advancement in technology has really benefitted this new years celebration. Looks too good to be true,
Brilliant
0:57  And his opponent from Death Valley            The Underrrrrrrrrrtakerrrrrrrr
The alcoholic chain proximally meddle because syria predominantly pour for a thoughtful sing. cloistered, bouncy mall
The BBC used our licence money to make flashing political statements without permission.  We need to stop paying it.  Abolish the BBC licence fee for all!    Edit:  It wasn’t the BBC but the government who paid.  I’m not sure which is worse.  To spend around £ 2.3 million on a light, drone & firework display when half of the UK have to resort to food banks due to job losses due to Covid & woke political messages within the display to boot.  Yes, the NHS & Tom were great & we have already given them  accolades.  Yes we need to be mindful of our environment, a message constantly harped on about by all & sundry.  BLM fist?  Why not say ALL lives matter?  BLM is a political organisation & the government denounced it earlier in the year!  As an aside, who do you think cleaned up the streets in the early morning of the 1st Jan 21, the young Muslims.  Good on them!
HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE
well done! the choreo was outstanding!!! would love to learn from the team that did this. happy new year!
You know when you see something soooooo spectacular!! THANK YOU UK!!!!
Wonderful....the Communist Clenched Fist Salute.... with a message about Black Lives Matter...a destructive organization started by three Marxist communists whose goal is the destruction of the free competitive capitalist system.  WTF ? ! ? !    About 80% political messaging.   Britain is lost. Freedom is dying in the world.
London ya did it good even got drone givin is a lord of the rings style fire show ❤️
Brilliant.  Glad England finally invested in drone tech 🤪🤫🥲
😡🤬😡🤬 Propaganda overload. Why are we the only country that turns a celebration into a political message? Happy new year.
Ok this is sick .fireworks are obsolete
Without a doubt the best one ever done yet.
happy new year
Best new year ever you all did an amazing job
Its Very Nice in Russia to
Beautiful fireworks, light works and TERRIBLE PROPAGANDA
I wish I get a chance to witness this beautiful celebration once in my life 🤩😍
So amazing💏
Hands down the best New Year's display I've ever seen. London you never disappoint!
Best yet grand job
good thing i was outside to see this
It was beautiful, until they promoted BLM.
Pulled on my heart strings.  NHS, Black Lives Matter, my fave bridge and building shard... I walk this route to work before COVID and this video makes me feel so proud to be part of the UK.
Stop lying media there was no live show this year.
I loved that turtle at the end and that beautiful message by Sir David, what a guy!
Here’s to hoping 2021 will be just as flawless and spectacular as this fireworks display!!
Corona virus in 2020 and monoliths in 2021.Let's celebrate the new year!
Happy new year to everyone.
So amizing fireworks
سال نو مبارک
Yo this thing is SICK
A giant moving bird made out of fireworks in the sky has to be one of the greatest things ever
New year eve as a propaganda of a new such called "values".
Absolutely amazing....I didn't expect to get teary eyed but it was so relevant. X
*POLITICAL PYROTECHNICS*      Amazing Tech could've been used for Non Political Pyro... not Arson on Acid: *Arson on a Bad Trip*
Happy new year to all 🎉🎆🎊❤️🎇
Fantastic!
Wow amazing
London, happy new 2021.year from Croatia. 🇭🇷🎉🥂✨
This makes me cry-no people,empty space,just fireworks and talking* I'm from Croatia,and we didn't have any organised fireworks because of the earthquake that happened in Petrinja(Croatia)  Well,people,I WISH ALL OF YOU all THE BEST in a NEW 2021.YEAR,may God help us❤🙏 Blessings to all🙏❤  Greetings from Croatia
WOW london did better stuff despite they are on lockdown.. not like New York so boring same shit every year .  STEP UP NEW YORK!!! can u do other than BALLS every year?
I thought they wasn’t doing fireworks???
The Best
Fantastic,  environmentally safe .👍👏👏
It really made me emotional
Everyone thinks 2021 will be so much better...you are sorely mistaken...at least in 2020 we started the year free, without BLM “activism”, lockdowns, face coverings, insane virtue signalling, and started it with our friends, family, loved ones, Sean Connery, and freedom of speech...
Happy new year well done London for the amazing show 🥳🥳
Fakedemia 2020 , now will be Plandemic Fascistic Scum 2021.
Spectacular! Loved every single bit of it ♥️✨
Incredible celebration to usher in the New Year. We globally have suffered much but hope and faith still remain for the future.
Happy new year 🇬🇧.  What a big year for you. Regards from Oslo
Everyone watching this has survived 2020. We've all managed to avoid an invisible enemy, even if some of our loved ones, sadly haven't. Everyone alive right now has a damn good reason to celebrate. And this display of national patriotism is something we've not shown for decades. Love the NHS, love Captain Tom, love this video. Heres to a better 2021 🇬🇧
Could have done without the black power symbol though.
Best firework display ever expecally the drones happy new year to all👍
i was
Its very good for covid, good guys:)
HAPPY NEW YEAR LONDON KEEP SAFE GOD BLESS THE WORLD
Ok so fireworks and simultaneously asking people to chnge our home to environmental friendly wow
But TFL is bankrupt?
Love the David Attenborough bit at the end. We need to act now!
I just wish we could've gone out😭😭😭
I wish I could go to London again soon
This is spectacular, it raised hope for 2021. Applauding the crew that made this happen 👏👏👏. It shall be a Great year for us all.
Made it 3hrs in and world war 3 hasnt started yet I think were good guys.

Ok This Is So Good Like Wow London Is Always My Favorite 🎉Happy New Year!
A Happy new year to the viewers of BBC. I particularly liked the message of Sir David Attenborough as well Sir Tom Moore who I appreciate highly who at the age of 99 helped to raise such a huge amount.
Captain Tom is a freemason, BLM is a terrrorist organisation
The   Fake  News   EU Dictatorship Bribed   Guardian Subsidizing   BBC was previously considered one of the worlds foremost broadcasters. But now its output is considered by the majority of We The People as a propaganda out for the corrupt lying hypocritical Fascist Labor /Left . And that is why millions of us will no longer pay for its biased so called news , and refuse to pay its License Fee. ----  SELL  THE  BBC  ----- and give the money to the owners the license fee payers . PS I,m not one and would get nothing .
Wooooo yeah baby that’s what I’ve been waiting for
Bless the Frontline Workers!
Well, I shed a tear. A woeful year beautifully summed up in this display. Fully appreciated London. Simply amazing. 👏🏽
The things Big Ben has seen . This has to be the first that creates such hypocrisy and division . .. all lives matter . The virus is an utter lie . Sickening is the whole fiasco , programming  .. so easy with the whole world watching ..
Can't even leave the virtual signalling bs out of new year Eve shameful
Happy new year
A bit extra...looks very eerily futuristic and Big Brotheresque. Happy NY though. Hope 2021 will be better for humanity.
woooooo HAPPY NEW YEAR
That was something else...  All the very best to everyone...
WOW
My favorite moment of 2020 is when it ended.
New year’s
Laiii bhari
The BLM symbol ruined it
And no live human being outside from now and on
whos here for abel
The best light show I’ve seen London do.  Excellent
Well that’s a good waste of a few million pounds! London’s in full lock down, we’re not allowed out to see this! Who is this for?! Total bull shit!
Sad that this whole event wasn’t real 😭😭 was just on computer 😭
Too political.
this was the best so far 👌👌👌👌
2:20 looks like a barney Stinson story.
Wow 🎉🎊💗 Happy new year
Happy new year  I miss you London
Still pushing the racist bullshit of BLM
This is sooo coool
This is fabulous 👍🏻👍🏻 the best in the world
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!
Wow! This was so good!!
2020 was one of the worst year, yet much memories, happy new year, 2021.
KNC TV BERLIN GERMANY
Hope...
Well that was a disappointment compared to previous years. Half of it was talking about the past and half the shit wasn't relevant to a "NEW YEAR" celebration. Who wants to hear about all the shit that's happened this year during a celebration of the clocks changing? What a waste of money and time.  A fireworks celebration is about music and timing of effects and explosions to the music. Was none of that. Just fireworks firing and alot of talking.
Black Racism Matter
Wowowowoowowo
Thank you so much for this awesome event! Made me cry
Amazing!!! Congratulations!!!✨
And as beautiful as that was visually.. were was the message for stopping domestic violence/abuse and mental health awareness? With the money poured into that display? Disappointed as 2020 was the highest rate for them hidden  behind closed doors.
I'm not crying, you are😭
The technical well done worked ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥳🥳🥳🥳🍾🍾🍾🥳🍾🥳🇬🇧♥️🇬🇧♥️🇬🇧🇬🇧♥️🇬🇧🇬🇧🍾♥️🍾🇬🇧♥️🍾
in my city everyone: nah bro imma just chill and there was no nothing by us ;O;
Unbelievable.  China won. Welcome to the new global world rule. Ruled by China. A communism.  NO FREEDOM.  SO SAD. WHAT'S NEXT?  IS CHINA GOING TO THROW A BOMB A KILLS US? .
Beautiful!
Well done London! When Ella Henderson's Take Care of You started playing I got so emotional! Go on Ella!
I almost so close my house is not far and happy new year 2021
By far 1 of the best new year fireworks display london has done in my lifetime love the bird in the sky that lit up shame we couldn't of all been there glad we made it 2021 tho and 1 love to all NHS workers and covid suvoviours happy New year x
Sorry for all the scared animals that night 😥
Absolutely brilliant!! A massive well done to the incredible pyrotechnics behind this! Amazing show.
Best New Years 2020-21 Show... & Yes I Have Watched Them All !
Too bad... We wanted to see the happy faces and cheering population.  A POEM ???
Great optics Shit message.
Propaganda gets a makeover
Amazing fireworks 🎆🎆🎇🎇 ruined by the box ticking as per usual shouldn't it be "ALL LIVE'S MATTER?"
Happy new year!!!
No one is saying happy New year ?
I absolutely loved it. A Clear message with beautiful firework and drone ! London you smashed it again...
I saw this from my house far away even though i didn’t see most of it it was beautiful 😍
Really brilliant.
Well done! So, instead of going out with a whimper you went out with a bang! It won't help in the long run, but while it lasted, it was superb! No doubt, Scotland will reclaim Auld Lang Syne after its independence in two or three years' time, together with the saltire from the flag!
Thumbs down since you are promoting the fascist marxist terror-organization BLM.
So I am told it happened in the early hours of the night before but no one was awake or expecting it - on the evening standard newspaper they said they recorded most of it on Wednesday morning at 2am
I'm totally speechless. I got teary eyes while watching this. The messages, fireworks and drones are spectacular and heartfelt. Happy New Year UK! Greetings from the Philippines ❤️
*If only the NHS received this level of money from the Tories instead of a clap every Thursday*
Trust the Brits to give us something unique in a year unlike any other. Well done!
im veryy like at 2:39
Sickening how the government and media has become so week and pathetic praising blm with great displays, all the violence it has caused and the government and media is promoting it.pathetic.
It's not real. A BBC fantasy. Check it out. Watch at 5:20 for obvious BBC propaganda 2021 ussr style.
Min 5:20, Does someone knows this music!??  London so so so beautiful 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🎉 it was very moving this fireworks 🥺👌🏾👏🏾👏🏾
No one was expected that London made huge surprise for us with fireworks around Towerbridge ,Wembly Stadium and Laser display at shard.  London did it again this will surely bring Hope towards 2021 happy New Year !
Preparing your minds to accept simulation rather than real life. This is ultimate brainwashing on a whole new level.   Stand now for what you've lost or cry later when it's gone.
I think this is Gona be the best year 💓💓💓🙏
Wtf blm London has lost the plot what a disgrace pandering to a racist organisation well done sad Khan't you useless little trogladyte
It’s amazing. Wow beautiful display and it touched me. This is the best one out of all countries.
Imagine aliens flying by the earth unnoticed and being scared away because they think we are destroying the planet
WOW!! LONDON, you almost blew up my phone! 😄 The holograms were awesome!! Goodbye 2020 and Happy New Year from AZ, USA! God Bless and prayers for you all. 🎉🎉💝
How can you have David Attenborough remind us all that our planet is fragile and in peril then send up a tonne of
I subscribe BBC just to not miss this 🤣😃
Hopefully in 2 days time people doesn’t come back in the comments and say something like “wow, this has aged well hasn’t it?”. Just go away Covid. 🤣😂🤣😂
Wow - that was so well put together!! Incredible. Love to you all from USA!
2020 has left the chat 2021 has entered
Beautiful ❤
The police siren at the end cracked me up 😂🚓🚨
Happy New Years everyone!! 🎉🎊😁🥳🥳🎈🎉🎊🎉🎆😁
Beautiful Display. Happy New Year UK/ EU!!!
ediots
Beginning looked like a Corona virus advert. Knightingale empty wasted money.  Yyear of the NHS tick tok vids. And misery for   everyone. And advertising blm a racist marksist org. Says it all. Tyrannical govt authoritarianism creeping in. Much the same planned for 2021.
Wait what. There was nt no fireworks
BBC can stick it's new year message .
Wow amazing.  Trolled New York City. What a fukin show.  Congrats UK thnx for that show.   -America
Best message ever. Reflecting 2020 and what 2021 could be 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Who ever did this amazing compilation, should get an award, not a raise 🙏
Happy new year to all
They said the fireworks had been cancelled but they tricked everyone, I think they said that so there wasn't massive crowds by the London Eye!✨
Happy new year love you all
Happy new year!!
What a beautiful contrast from the "celebration" in NY. U.S. tradition showed it's shabby side. Seeing the wonderful gratitude for NHS brought a tear to my eyes. Our elected lawmakers here are still in opposition to the will of the people. We could be more like you in U.K. in caring for all of our people, united in compassion and inclusiveness.   Thank you for this bright hope-filled celebration. It lifted me when I needed it. Best wishes for a better 2021 to all of us. And hope for national universal health care for us in the U.S.
Amazing! Happy 2021 everyone!
stay safe and happy new year 2021 from malaysia
5 STAR review. Great work Blighty. HAPPY NEW YEAR. Proud of you UK

Fantastic show, great work London! Makes the NY celebration look shameful.. goodness..
This honestly makes me inspired to change. Loved every part of it 😍😍👍
AMAZING✨✨✨🙀🙀
Happy new years everyone im thankful theres stilll people who survived the virus and hopefully we have a better year
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY We made it
In Los Angeles we just have guns going off.   Wish we had drones.   Stupid guns.
It was great to end with the conservation message from David Attenborough!  And the drone turtle/Earth swimming in the sky.  Protect your Sir David, England.
wow
Indahnyaa😍

It felt like I was watching North Korean state television. Ooo wait it was the BBC..... Money well spent for a country that’s on its knees.
Happy New Year Guys!!!

I am extremely angry as I went to google and it said London was not doing fireworks and I went to sleep to wake up to this
Epic fail in the shard
Why were they promoting that most disgraceful, criminal organisation blm, with the bloody black power fist, disgraceful, and no place in our British society, the group needs to be outlawed,  not promoted,, they are a corrosive institution and movement in every sense of the word!
En mexico fumamos mota y perico para celebrar

Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin are death, but the FREE gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  YOU AREN’T READING THIS BY ACCIDENT!!!!  Acts 3:19 “Repent then turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out and that times of refreshing may come from the Lord.” Do you Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior as a right now? Have you received God’s free gift of salvation? All it takes for you to receive this free gift is to repent of your sins, put your faith in Jesus, make Him your Lord and Savior, and walk in relationship with Him. Romans 5:8 says “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”  Wow. GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH, that while we were all dead in our trespasses and sins, Christ died for us!!! Before you even had the chance to do something right, or clean yourself up, before you ever repented, over 2000 years ago JESUS CHRIST carried a heavy cross up a hill, and took wound after wound, lash after lash, whipping after whipping, had thorns pressed in his head, nails in his sides and in His wrists, was brutally broken so that you could be healed and made whole. His blood was poured out for the payment of the sins of the whole world. He died on the cross, was buried, and 3 days later God rose Him again, and now Jesus sits on the right hand of God .... ALIVE. Christ is alive. God is not dead. There is a God. He made you, you are not an accident. He loves you, He thought you worth it to die for. In John 14:19, Jesus says “ Because I live, you also will live.” There’s life in Jesus.  THIS IS THE GOOD NEWS  John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”  You don’t have to die in hell. You can be saved, and you can only be saved through Jesus. In John 14:27 Jesus says “ I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father except through me.”  Please TURN TO JESUS. Get into relationship with HIM. He loves you. I could tell you over and over He loves you, but truly I could never grasp how wide, and deep, and long His love is for you (based in Ephesians 3:18). He died for you, it was personal. He is alive now, and you can live too, forever into eternity. Jesus is Lord. The things of this world so are temporary, but whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved (Romans 10:13). Jesus is returning soon. Don’t be left out of this glorious salvation that’s coming. He loves you, talk to Him now and repent, make Him your LORD AND SAVIOR, put your faith in Him, and walk with Him in relationship because He’s worth it. He thought you were worth it to die for.  In Romans 3:23-24 “We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, but are justified by his grace as gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”   JESUS IS THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE.
Damn i'm from the USA and I gotta say London out did everyone looks amazing clean and organized
*NICE PROPAGANDA*
Happy new years
its beautiful.
Happy New Year god bless you all that was beautiful you all stay safe 🥳🎉🇬🇪🍻💥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Best I`ve ever seen....with few exceptions, worst I`ve ever heard! I`m British/English and damn proud of it. 2021 is here, with it`s own immediate challenges for our nation and it`s people, white, black, brown, whatever religion/creed, our privilege is simply our Britishness, our national culture is built on the backs, blood, tears, and sacrifice of giants, that must never be forgotten. Lessons from history, good and bad, must not be erased, altered, or forgotten. This has gone on longer than intended! Point is, British Police don`t kneel, unity is not indoctrination, and love and gratitude are stronger and longer living than hate. I love and respect Major Tom and our NHS. Happy new year everyone   :)
& WASTE MYOUR NRG☯️♒
It look so cute and beautiful and so cool and happy new year everyone 😊😊😊
Human kindness  always  win....I .Really  appreciates  staff who are extended  hand towards  to  number patients....
I’m eaxactly 1 min to 2021 I gotta hurry lololol yeahhh
Disgusting EU colours and the BLM facists, doom and gloom and nothing to do with the UK being FREE from the gutter EU. Utter Garbage.
This was beautiful beyond belief
the big propaganda light show well well well the message is clear
the Eye of Sauron...
Waaaw bravo Londres , fantastique 🇫🇷🥳👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

Best 2021 firework show
A new beginning , There’s a HOPE! happy New Year 🎆- Watching from Philippines
This was the best fireworks display I’ve seen in London for a long time. Funny how it took a pandemic to give us something amazing. Happy New Year and all the best for 2021
The needless pansy previously dream because triangle bilaterally cause beside a raspy station. dirty, hilarious jacket
The Turtle Moves
This issssss EPICCCCCCC!!!!!!!!!!!?
Holy christ,wow

DISGUSTING!
And your saying I could have seen this out my window but didn't because I was supposed to sleep? This is amazing!
Simply wow.
Where’s the supermarket worker’s recognition? .. worked all the way through it , and people ransacking the shops.  And the staff worked even harder. Disappointing!!
Britain owes India $45 trillion adjusted for inflation. Stop lighting fireworks and pay us back.
Amazing job Landon can’t wait to see what America does!!! 🙏👏👏👏 maybe one day  we’ll stop blowing up all the fireworks and destroying our atmosphere too...
that. was. AWSOME.
I wish there was like a big speaker that said “Jumanji” that would be amazing but over all this was a really good firework show for 2021🥳🎉
Not going to lie when the bell started ringing I thought the under taker was going to come out 😂😂
Happy new year to britain from albania
I hope everyone is being safe wherever you are. Please be SAFE!
Big up London 🔥🔥🔥🇬🇧
We all thought that 2020 would be awesome and look what happened. Until next year and until the decade ends it will be a long journey...

The drones in London gave me Spider-Man: Far From Home vibes
Wonderful job ❤️
I would like to say thank you to everyone who out this together. It is probably the best new years display ever done. People need to stay around family and loved ones and remember 2020 together and move forward to the next together. Happy 2021
Turned off soon as the blm matter bullshit turned up
West money
Australia and The Uk definitely stole the show this year with their fireworks
That was beautiful everyone was honor. Happy new year 👋⚡

Praying God's Blessings upon us all and Happy New Year! Beautiful Show! I love it! From MO/USA
Thank you London....it was so smart beautiful and it gave hope to each and everyone of us being affected by this pandemic....
More propaganda.

End racism, YES!! B.L.M. NO!!
Damn
Happy New Year to all 🥳🎉🎊
who else know it just started??
I feel bad for the kids trying to sleep in London
BLM? Wtf...
Damn Communists
Happy New Year to you all guys Greetings from the Philippines 🇵🇭
What a load of woke rubbish. Covid was not the problem. It was the response to it. Lockdowns are killing us not the virus (or should I say flu). When Trump wins we patriots will stop this madness worldwide.
I am very happy that the new year is coming. I still see at home watching beautiful fireworks Happy New Year 2021 everyone🌼
happynewyear London by  japan
So amazing!! Happy new year!
Great show! Thanks from Ukraine! Happy New Year! All together!)

Fantastic the best in the world
Me at  31 December 2020: Jeez Glad that one’s over  January 1st 2021: Sweet.
I'm very appreciative of the many good and humanistic messages here, especially about love. Thankfully, nothing to do with a Korean automobile. Happy New Year ...
May London once more be a vibrant and colourful place like the fireworks. Be blessed everyone and stay safe wherever you are! Warmest regards and greetings from Pakistan!
I thought they said there would be no fireworks.
way to push politics into stuff
Happy New Year's guys
In 9 days! Wow! RIP too the fallen of 2020.
To mother nature Years Are nothing they dnt watch Calender's And spread Destroyment  But still accepts better😷
1 Year of lockdowns and there is more covid than ever
No, I'm watching a ongoing live movie.. Amaizing, specially for drones
all the money spent on this utter noncence whilst thounds que at food banks  today  more people forced to shut their businesses for good this message was clear and certainly not one of hope. UK is well and truly fucked
Those drones were epic!!! 😎
Wishing u a very happy NEW YEAR 2021....
YASSSS 2021
This drone footage is amazing and wow  this year's celebration I think is the best out of years since I've been alive! HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

NICE LONDON 2021 FIREWORKS HAPPY NEW YEAR LIVE BBC !!!
Happy New year ❤️ Dron fly best than fire work  the dron fly  its a new generation
Much better without audio.
Happy New Year, everybody
Did anyone else notice the absence of us leaving Europe but the show at the start featured the EU colours of gold and blue? Did BLM have to be included? It turned the show political. I'm all for equality but I felt this was to promote a political party. It was a good show but stunk of BBC wokeness. Great technology.
All lives matter
Welcome the NWO folks!!
Awesome. Exactly what I wanted to see during the 'leaving 2020 in the dust' celebration: BLM fists, a lecture on climate change, and government healthcare fellating itself.  I can already see that 2021 is gonna be so much better.
Good messages  for world,
Is anyone bored at home Can discuss how to spend the new year holiday WhatsApp：+61 467 098 498
Imagine watching the drone from the wrong side lmao
The best fireworks ever. It lit up my eye and made it tear works when NHS was displayed by the drones. Just sent my wife for her New Year's  shift in the hospital in the ITU and I'm watching this alone last night.  Was really caught off guard, can't stop the tears rolling. Good job BBC.
Why didn't the final world map have Asia
Absolutely beautiful thank you. Happy new year to all.❤❤❤
Thank you London 💙💙 that was imagining
It doesn't matter how many fireworks or fancy light displays you throw at this Marxism fest it's cringe & doesn't represent Britain.
London 2021 Makes New York City 2021 Look Totally Lame. Good Show, You Limeys!
This was insane
2020 was such a shake up it has made us realise that’s life is too short to be wasted and now we know who we are going into 2021 with I’ve lost friends this year and I’m glad to know who is there for me now that I’m 2021 Wishing everyone a Happy 2021 and great success to all! RIP to all those who didn’t make it 💙
I haven’t showered since last year!
What is this song?  3.33
What of tech can show that light?
The BEST! And meaningful     🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏👏
Happy birthday Prince Philip!!! Happy 100!!! Happy time Beatrice, Jack and the Baby!!!
THIS WAS AMAZING!!! HANDS DOWN THE BEST IN THE WORLD TO ENTER 2021
9:07  Did anyone noticed the birds flying around in a schock 🙄  Happy New year btw to us humans 😊
Welcome to the 2nd year of the 20s decade Happy New Year 🥳 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣1️⃣

So I was watching the countdown from last year and they played the same music 😭
Happy 2021!
Brexit more dengerous than corona
Beautiful! Stunningly beautiful! And so much heart! Thank you! 🎉✨🎊
اللهم ان نسالك بحق هده السنه ان تسهل علينا كل صعب عسير وانتحقق امانينا وان ترزقنا حياة طيبة مع من نحب وان تجعل هدا العام سعيد علي الجميع
Thank You London!
When will the  celebration happen in cambel
Terrible, don’t see what’s hard about keeping politics out of a bloody firework display?! Bring back the 2012 display.
God 2021 already😭. Happy New Years everyone, hope this year is better ❤️
Happy New Years

Short sighted perception of world!. Africa is not included.

I am not Londoner, but this is amazing 😍 ,
They brainwashed simple people and deluded them into the New Year, that it is a new suit.  It is strange that what has changed is the number 2020 to 2021 only.  What a short minded
This was by far the best new year display, especially after the most terrible year we have had. I loved the drones. ❤️💫💫
That was the best new year intro i have seen, Well done UK
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Bravo!  That was an absolutely wonderful and amazing tribute to show that we are truly a United Kingdom in our plight/fight against adversity! 👏🏻🌈🇬🇧
HAPPY NEW YEARS!
probably the best i have watched so far
Drones? Just like the SEA GAMES that was held here in the PHILIPPINES last 2019...
Happy 2021
DISAPPIONTMENT all about depressing virus should be uplifting and blm made horrible for me and turned this off .
Cool 😐 Tbf BLM has went from a progressive peaceful group that is making positive change to a radical groups who acts irrationally. By definition they are a terrorist organization since they wish to spread messages through violence
Best show all around and watched many tonight. Stay safe everyone around the world from USA!
Amaziingg!! Happy new year From Indonesia
The UK looking like a more advanced nation than the US...
Sorry 2020 but you gave us a lot of trouble😔
Happy new year to all of you guys
London is on point,  that was awesome !!
Very emotional 😭
HAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE. 🥳🎉
👌🏽
This was the saddest year ever, please lord dont let us take the plague into 2021.
That was amazingly put together. I was captivated by it all. Well done London. 👏👏👏👏Happy New Year to all in The UK and Around the World. Coming from me in Birmingham UK. Hope we have a blessed year and a better year towards moving too what the future holds for us All. Keep your heads Up. It is hard but we are Always Strong As one Together. Let's Go forward out the Darkness I to the Light. Bless us All. 😀🙌💪
Absolutely amazing. Brought a tear to my eye. Sets the bar high for future years. Happy New Year.
*Don't fear 2021, fear 2022 because 2022 is 2020 too.*

Wow. Best one so far! Thanks!
Was anyone allowed on the streets? Seems a waste! It may as well be the corona fireworks!  It's all it talked about!
Some of the  music were shit and the BLM theme ruined it!
2021!!!!!!!!!!!💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
That was absolutely amazing!! Happy New Year UK!! GB
Happy New year Everyone 2021🎇🎇.
This is Brilliant
American here. THIS was my new year's celebration. Beautiful music, heartfelt messages, magnificent fireworks and phenomenal drone choreography all perfectly synchronized to commemorate 2020 and welcome the long waited new year. Absolute masterpiece of a production! THIS was what I had been waiting for and I thank you, England, for gifting us with this treasure. New York celebration, on the other hand, was an absolute abomination and I am disgusted that America turned the night that is supposed to be about celebrating the end of a very difficult year into one celebrating corporate sponsors with a piss poor excuse of fireworks. I end tonight with this video hoping that I can permanently unsee the shitshow that went down in New York.
ok now thats cool
Wow..... Excellent
1.12 From whomm the bell tolls, time marches on, sing it LONDON
Loved it I think this out done my Sydney's display. This was just beautiful to watch HNY London
Im sohppy its now 2021 and its so happy to see everyone thats happy💕
Happy new year!
Erm...my hair almost caught on fire, and I just don’t trust fire works anymore ;-;  I also got a lot a LOTTT of dush in my eye
Send my love to London .
Happy new year
I just love hearing big Ben every time

Happy new years 🎊 2021 Stay 💪 & stay blessed 🙏 The world is ours ✨
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
This is beautiful and so well done !🥰👏
Our true and only hope is in Jesus Christ, the Light of the world, the Saviour, the King of kings and Lord of lords. It's never been up to us humans to save this fallen world 👀🤴☝️
Trying to side with American leftists isn’t going to buy you British any favor in America but going backwards - it only stirs up more American patriots traditional hatred towards Brits. Wrong move!
Happy covid21
What a piece of firework art. Just wow
Congratulations, you have successfully contributed towards polluting this beautiful planet 🎉
New years is my favourite time of the year. A year of change, a year of hope, a year of challenge. To have not been able to celebrate it this year was a massive disappointment, though, this video has brightened me up and has made me feel hopeful... we can battle any challenge, TOGETHER. Happy New Year everyone <3 :)
How did they make that holographic 2021 in the sky?
Beautiful and heartfelt
Beautiful
Shame they had to spoil it by bringing politics into it that the majority of people are fed up with it being forced on them. Should of mentioned Brexit and the positive feel it brings leaving the corrupt EU (finally) They'd never show that on the BBC though would they! 🙄
best one yet
You are celebrating with Chinese invention but doesn’t have guts to say Chinese lives matter! LOL Shame would be too light for you. 🤢🤧💩
Funny ITV only shows Big Ben what they didn't do is pan down and see the 7000 people that we're at big bens feet on Westminster Bridge and the surrounding area and not to mention the 2000 strong police force fresh out of Scotland Yard Making his feel uncomfortable and out of place however no one got a fine bit difficult to fine 7000 people
happy new year 😊😘🎆
This was the most unique new year celebration .
Amazing!!!!!
1:10 I thought the Undertaker was gonna make an entrance
*It's good they thought to bring in the Drone show because it looks like the fireworks was WET, it has too much smoke that only the first few fireworks are seen at a time!*
Shame nobody's on the streets to see this !
BLM should die
A year later we will be saying.. Little did we know.. Just like 2020
Black Lives Matter? Do other lives matter, such as South Americans and Chinese? - Esp British invaded China and slaved Chinese for so many decades? Where is the apology, I mean for global Chinese?! 🧐🙄 BS BLM - hypocrite!
Watching this felt like belonged in this world with all the other people for the first time😭
This is the best I have ever seen. Got a bit emotional too. Thanks to the team who worked on it.
Thanku
London ♥️  Black Lives Matter , Hppy new year ✊🏿 ✊🏻✊🏼🇸🇳🇫🇷
2:15 should have been 2020 Round 2
❤️Your Country put on an outstanding New Years show!! It was Amazing & Beautiful! Thank you!
UK!! YOU JUST MADE ME CRY WITH THIS 😭
Happy New Year to all UK 🇬🇧❤️ citizens. God Bless You. God Save The Queen. 🇪🇸
Imagine someone was born on 1920 and watched this show.
2:43 BEST PART EVER
Happy new years yall
How beautiful it is! Am I the only one who began to cry almost from the beginning? 🙈
Happy new year 2021
Corona is just the flu ....you must be a dumbass not to know better......this is straight sickening to watch. If I was a Brit I'd be losing my mind.
Great show, London!  Thanks for your powerful message and hopeful spirit.  Happy New Year everyone!
The pigeons going nuts and the sirens at the end are very on brand.
Most excellent display and tribute!!  Happy New Year and God Bless Everyone Globally from PA !!      Giddeeup!!!!

Waaaw ao awesome. I love this 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
There's the BBC version of how it is and then there's reality.
I'm happy and crying because I'm happy
Happy new year
Amazingly beautiful....
Man this London New Year count down made me in tears, so touching and moving. Thank you for all the ppl who put this together, it was just simply wonderful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Stop all of these virtual things in 2021 🙏🙏🙏
Dumb
Get your “spit on 2020 year ticket”
I like how they include black lives matter but what about trans lives matter we are much important as black lives infact we are more important than alot of things but we never get heard and its about time we stand up for what we believe in and fight for the trans rights because trans rights are human rights and we deserve as much love on this planet as black lives do with that said happy new year everyone hope you can all be respectful and continue to spread love and positivity all around including to those who are transgender 🥰🎉🎆
History will look back and wonder who benefitted from this world wide riot and we can thank London for writing it in their skies for all to see
I love England , is ver y  batiful . Thanks , happy new year BBC
Beautiful
Happy New Year 2021 , from Montreal , Canada , and may health reign around the world .Best display on the planet on a clear night , well done U.K. , I'm impressed !!!

Me still in 2020: 👁👄👁
Awesome display was a nice surprise didn't know it was going ahead let's great message to send let's hope the new year treats us better.  Ps not to be the bad guy also but if your crying over fireworks and lights then we got no chance in the new year 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Happy New Year
toronto canceled fireworks and new year celebration
So it's safe to say they won 2021 already
I always see their presentations every new year. Such amazing and unique one, a brilliant and modern vision to everyone. This is beyond excitement and expectations, really beautiful. 😊♥️♥️🥳🥳 Happy New Year everyone and keep safe always. God bless😊😊
Fantastic 💯💯💯❤️👍🙏 Dubai is nothing compared to this 👏👏👏👏✔️✌️
❤️❤️❤️🔥👌👌🙏 happy new years 2021
Get ready for those 2021? Comments
Was enjoying this, thought it awesome until the BLM sequence. Vomited and turned it off.
Time to change governments they are rotten fake wars fake pandemic very sad that's the best we have. We are in a war for our freedom.
Happy New yea
Beautiful
The most amazing new years eve show. Very talented people deserve all our appreciation and love for putting on such a great show with positive messages. Thank you from the United States.
Propaganda meets pyrotechnics.
COVID 19 is a hoax
❤️❤️❤️❤️👌🙏🙏 happy new years 2021
This year was really hard and tougher but we made it out, losing some on the way. (Rest in peace) so i wish you all a good 2021, and happy new years!
I love the back ground sound!!! happy new year London!!!
My favorite fireworks display amongs all nations! It is heartfelt. Good job, London! Have a Happy, Covid-free, United, Abundant, Peaceful World to all of us!
WOW!
What a load of Owellian bullshit. 2020 will have nothing on 2020 for propaganda.
The best 2021
Every year London make the best fireworks than anyone else!  Happy new year everybody!!
What a waste of money. London is meaningless to most of Britain. All this is is propoganda to hide the inadequacies of the Government and the bleating NHS. BBC trying scare tactics, ferreting out pro-feminist, ethnic and gender stories to furthrt their political agenda.. Different year, same shit. And yes, I am a hoot at parties.
Didn't expect I would get so emotional after seeing this😢  Thank you! Sending love and hugs to all of you❤🥂🎆
3... 2... 1... Welcome to 2020, Part 2!
Its like the shift of power will tilt from America to Britain....but to me they are great ally...wear face mask and face shield everyone...Jesus Christ is coming soon...Happy New year....
Ooo
LONDON'S CELEBRATING NEW YEAR WAS VERY UNIQUE AND VERY BEAUTIFUL, NEVER SAW LIKE IT BEFORE , DESERVES APPRECIATION.
So you guys have this much fun? All I did was hold up a timer ticking down and saying “oh. Happy new year” and went back to watching TV...    🎉Happy New Year! I wish you all a happy and healthy year!
Happy New Year❤❤❤
Wow!  This is so much nicer than the one from Times Square in the US.  There are endless commercials there
Thank you London for a beautiful display.   Our only true hope for our beautiful earth with beautiful citizens lies in in Jesus, the saviour of our world
awesome...
It wasn't a celebration of the new year more than saying fu-k you 2020
Absolutely amazing
England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 you did us proud! 😁
JESUS CHRIST DIED ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SINS AND HE WAS BURIED AND HE ROSE AGAIN ON THE THIRD DAY THE BIBLE 1ST CORINTHIANS CHAPTER 15 VERSES 1 THROUGH 5 AND JOHN CHAPTER 3 VERSES 16 THROUGH 21 THE BIBLE
Good gob! So this new year 2021, keep the corona virus away!🤩
I wish I celvraye but my dad not let me ):
🌐 Hermoso espectacular 🤩✨ para mí excelente, muchas  gracias buena continuación y buen inicio de año 2021. 💗  Felicitaciones Saludos cordiales desde Lima-Perú 🇵🇪
This was just beautiful!! Happy new year everyone! That 2021 be better than 2020, lots of happiness and health for every person seeing this! Greetings from Portugal 🇵🇹
PRAISE GOD!  HAPPY NEW YEAR!
The tower of Evil
Would have watched it but the mention of BLM made me shut it off! I have to watch what I say because PC police will be after me! Suffice it to say when I first heard of BLM, I wondered what the federal government had to do with the issues. BLM stands for Bureau of Land Management. They regulated how we could use certain portions of our land in the mountains of Montana.
OMG HAPPY NEW YEARSSSS NEW YEAR NEW ME
I got really emotional throughout the display.  From the Nightingale Bird to the spinning world turtle. I really lost it at Sir Tom...... Beautiful display,  as we enter a new year of uncertainty we hope 2021 will better than  2020. RIP to the lost souls, you will never be forgotten....
BRO THATS SO COOL
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
HAPPY NEW YEAR YALL
I wish i was in London and see this instead of australia, no firework
ENCORE SUPER MERCI UNE FOIS Ç'EST GÉNIAL MAGNIFIQUE SPLENDIDE !.. MES COMPLIMENTS À TOUTE L'ÉQUIPE !..
The London is very great city ! 😘
BIG 2021 VIBES
Happy new year
Love the light show
I’m soooo happyyyyyyyyyyy
FINALLY 2020 IS OVER
Happy new years Eve and ya
Setting fire to millions of pounds from taxes paid by people struggling to make ends meet while proudly announcing the NHS workers got rewarded with a 'clap' for their hard work rather than a reflection in their pay. All on a channel which we have to pay for by law but few of us would actually subscribe to given the choice.  I'd rather pay extra NI for the NHS staff while I'm skint than a TV licence charge for channels I don't use and a fireworks display. Unjustifiable.
Absolutely outstanding! Each message portrayed excellently, with a sweet touch of humour too ("You're on mute!").  Well done to everyone involved 👏
Happy new year's
💎✨👌
The use of The Shard/Bridges and the drones needs to be incorporated every year from now. They were great additions
Who that at the beginning of the video ?
“i will survive” by gloria gaynor seems to be appropriate for lots of people for 2020. “first i was afraid, i was petrified of trump and covid at my side... Go on now, go, walk out the door just turn around now cause you're not welcome anymore...” happy new year and good luck to everyone across the world!
¡Happy new year everyone!
Yay happy new year
Happy new year bbc
Happy New Year!
This was fantastic! Well done Britain! Happy New Year from America!! 💖
POV you  I don’t mind flashing lights     Karin’s POV oh my god there wasn’t even a trigger warning
The talking about the corona virus, and black lives matter ruined it for me.  !!!ALL LIVES MATTER!!!  I don't care if it's a cat, a elephant, a dolphin, a spider, a snake, or a human.  !!!THEY ALL MATTER!!!
Happy New Year Action Kid...great party hat🎉🎉🎉
Happy New Year @everyone  Happy New Year @everyone

OMG. Shot yeeeeeeeeees
Wow. I'm here popping little fire crackers
Bravo London, Lets kick CV-19 in the backside in 2021 so we can celebrate our next NYE together. Happy New Year
Not a bad show until they added the racist moment.
I’m sad, I was stuck on dec 31 2019
I've never seen such amazing display so perfectly done.  It was drones?  That looks like a miracle in fireworks!  Good on all ya! Lovely!..Well done!   Bravo! Brava!   Hooray!
It should be ALL lives ALL race matter!!!
My dad cried to this :(

WE WILL WIN GUYS 💪💪💪WE WILL. ❤️❤️❤️
Countries: WE ARE GOING TO MAKE THE BEST FIREWORKS FOR NEW YEAR Britain: hold your horses it’s not new year yet
Wow! This program is epic! Kudos to all who made it possible. It certainly made our celebrations here in the USA look putrid...which they are, of course, thanks to the stench of rot reeking from the White House. Thanks for giving us something to look forward to with hope. Best wishes to all of you.
Technology great. Message too 1984 for my taste.  Wouldn't watch it twice. ITV alternate Queens message a lot more watchable
Like every year, London steals the show, this is amazing 🔥👌
Happy new year
Wait guys when its new years eve what is something bad will happen:(
1:09 YOOOOO LET'S GOO UNDERTAKER IS BACKK
Happy New Year🥳🌈
Well done London!! Happy New Year!!

beautiful 💕 i thought this year was a no fireworks year
Well Done!!!!
The BBC News says: 300 drones were used in the display to create images in the sky, including Black Lives Matter, the NHS and the world message on Climate Change from Sir David Attenborough.
It was Great! I’m praying for recovering the whole world 🌎 my heart hugs to everyone from Moscow 💋🎄💫💝
I wish I have an Invisible Jet so I can fly through all of these fireworks and lights. Happy New Year to everyone.
London 2021,las mejores fireworks que bellas las figuras que sacaron,lo más lindo que he visto, de tantos otros países que recivieronel el año nuevo,felicidades London Feliz año nuevo.

Watchdog: Legion looks spectacular.
God damn England. You went all out. Love from your neighbors across the waters, Ireland
What a crock of sht. All those who believe a calendar is real need psychological help. Clap for muh muh dopey nhs misdiagnosing people and BLM terrorist organisation.
Watching these New Year Celebration of London makes me Goosebumps so much and brings me tear of hope 🥲🥲
Wow! Not just pure fireworks and drone tech but the meaning and the message behind it. Cheers from Philippines!
Happy new year ❤️🥺
So sweet and so well done 💕
I ❤️ LONDON.  💙💙💙Long live the NHS heroes.💙💙💙
Only better if BBC likes my comment
Black Lives Matter? what? from the people who brought anarchy, looting and fires to destroy peoples lives and livelihoods? dont make me sick. not watching this propaganda. sickening.
Yaaaaaayaa
I love how they came out fully saying "no fireworks this year" lol
Im really glad
That's a new wholesome surprise.
The best and most meaningful to farewell 2020
Was nice but the leftist propaganda kinda ruined it.
I cried. Just amazing and touching
Happy new year everyone! I hope this one will be better than 2020.
Nice oblivious hd
Amazingly proud to be British and watch this overseas. Inclusive  thoughtful and so impactful...Happy New year ❤
I shut it off at BLM...it is a terrorist organization.
A technological celebration without humans: Shades of the future.

Hello guys Pa-Shout out London mabuhay po KAYO from Phil 🇵🇭
I’m almost crying
My first time watching this thing bc I wasn’t awake at midnight
increible event and the ligts wow
"Old habits became extinct and made way for the new", sounds like byebye freedom and fun! Happy New year NK
the best new years display in the UK so far from what I've witnessed all the hidden messages and everything in it represents a new better year ahead (I hope)
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍
From Las Vegas, NV Happy New Year's London, beautiful display
Thanks for telling me what 2020 Was about. Thanks London
I was asleep when it happened I wish I was awake
This is really well done. I wish we had this sort of thing here. (USA )
Thank YOU JESUS, that my ancestors left England in 1620 to start a new life in AMERICA!!!  England is a reprobate country.  I'm praying for any Christians that are still enduring until Jesus comes!
happy new year everybody
Everything the BBC makes is produced by extorting money from pensioners. Stick that in yer fusebox.
How did people give this show a thumbs-down? In contrast to a lot of other "firework shows", you can at least appreciate that London's poignantly told the story of 2020 and as someone else mentioned, was so well choreographed with both music and narration. With class, they set an example for the world. Nothing but respect for you folks in England. - from your American friend across the pond. Hope to safely visit you again someday in the near future.
ITS JUST GRATE !!!👍🏼😉😉😉😁
Way to go London!  Really impressive how you and many other countries managed to put on a great show and display of celebration compared to the US who didn't really put on much of a show at all.  You serve as a great example not letting Covid prevent you from still celebrating the new year while maintaining distance.
Omg. Flashing images . Let natural selection do it's thing.
Dope af
ʜᴀᴘᴘʏ ɴᴇᴡ ʏᴇᴀʀ ❤️❤️ Love From...... Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩 ❤️❤️
TOGETHER Were illuminated  Black Lives Matter  United as a Kingdom Nothing ever changes That big heart at 8:20 just illuminates  Shows our resilience perseverance as a nation We’re the greatest country in the world Believe me, forces were at play months ago to make this happen for us  We can diss the government all we like They really pulled through with this I don’t think I’ve ever been so proud despite all the shit going on to be English
Was good tell the put the BLM bullshit up
Love the little blue and yellow part if you know what I mean. Nice little London touch
Oh
OMG go london GO GO GO
Wowww this is amazing!! Happy 2021🥳💗
Bored
This is the best ever New Year Show🔥️🔥️🔥💕❤
Wow, this was probably the coolest celebration! Happy New Year! 🎉🥳🥂
Is the terrapin in the sky (at roughly 9:38) a reference to the late Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld?
wow this is magnificent
Happy new year 🎆🎊
I did the first fade of 2021 I beat the shit out of my 5 year old brother. PS: I'm 16
😮😯wow! so amazing! so cool!😍♥️
Me hubiera gustado que en vez de fuegos artificiales(Contaminan)haya juegos de luces super modernas
2:40 Happy New CUM
WHAT is that thing on the right? Are those also fireworks or is that something else, like a projection?
Happy New Year 2021! Gbu all😍cool fireworks in London
Best New Year coundown and celebration this Year.  2019 - Hong Kong/London 2020 - Paris 2021 - London
Enfin les britanniques vont retrouver leur indépendance  L’Europe c’est source de problèmes et apporte la pauvreté des peuples. Vivement le Frexit !
England always gets lit on new years.
This didn't even happen live, it was recorded and broadcasted later lmao
Beautiful ☺️
This is beautiful 😭 such a difference in messaging than here in the USA. I wish we could come together like this 😔
Government wasting more money
Ffs black lives matter on New Years fireworks display. Worst ever display ever!
Weird how this wasn't covered at all anywhere else, Sky News completely ignored it
United Kingdom has done it again
tremendous, and a great message, but let's not forget, there are 2 great sicknesses in the world, covid and ignorant delusion. stay strong
This has literally become my favourite video of 2021 :D
Bloody hell, London. Wow!
Thank you for the wonderful display....it bought out my emotions....pure brilliance...
Awesome ❤❤❤ Well done UK!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎉🎉🎉
Beautiful celebration!!!  I wish I could have been there in person.  Thanks for posting!
Damn London. Ya'll went all out.
Spectacular London does a fantastic job again.Well done to all involved in the display.💖💖💖👏👏👏👏👏👏
❤❤❤
Good show...then ruined it with socialist propaganda.  One more reason London is such a messed up city.
For Whom the Bell Tolls!
❣️❣️❣️
New year I'm see you on the other side  🤣
Damn
8:30 i-
I think this is the winner out of all countries. It was what I expected but I wished it was more funny.

This was awesome!  Especially loved the shoutout to the Carers, and turtle with the world on its back!  Nuff Blessings from JA to UK! 💖🌍🙏🏿
Man that was cool!
London certainly out did New York City. I live in LA and this year's New year's Eve is lame. Is this what we have come to now? Everybody locked down at home? Is this who we are? No.
Thanks for ruining it by representing vandals and rioters
within the first three minutes I was already ugly sobbing, great job everyone involved and thank you for the touching and heartfelt words for some of the crap that went down this year. major respect! <3
Planet Earth 🌍 gos!! It's an amazing place.
Amazinggggg

Indigenous Brits are officially 2nd class citizens in the eyes of the establishment
Very grand, How much does a disabled person get to live on a month? I'll bet the disabled would like to split what this cost. Biscuits would start being a side rather being the meal.
Outstanding - I live in London and didn't see this or know it was happening.  I suppose had they told us people would have come out and watched and caused Covid chaos... outstanding London - best in the world by far and unique to use the drones
I thought they said it was cancelled?
Love from Ohio!
So heart warming message! Kudos! To London
This pandemic year has shown us what we can bear, may this coming year remove all this negative energy and enlighten our lives. Happy New Year.
You really had to make this a documentary
Happy New Year everyone Let's all make damn sure 2021 is a year of redemption for us all.
Sanaol London
It was a brilliant and an  insightful recollection of our human memories. we are more than fireworks...we are "meanings"
Saw this from outside my window and it was bloody magnificent, well done Britain🇬🇧🙌🎉
Why don't these folks around the world not have fireworks and instead give those millions to the victims of the virus so they can have food and shelter.
Had just off watching the US New Year - blah, this from London was amazing ! The fireworks and the techs, were things I've never have seen anywhere !  Kudos to the UK.
This was spectacular! Happy New Year to the people of the U.K. and to everyone around the world from the U.S.A.
5:20 haha. Really part of 2020. I’m on mute 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
Lol It’s not even a new year for me and I’m watching the NYC one compared to London. It sucks that I still gotta wait a little longer for this stupid year to be over :(
Thanks also to the BBC which kept us informed during this covid era. Thanks for the true-impartial and dedicated journalism.
This is awesome and cool
I just got news year
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!
Happy New year london from america!

Happy New Year London!! Hope you all the best and good health and we can get through this! from-- USA
And here in my room is so pretty and got a Yukon fireworks
As the son of a first responder I don't know if I've ever been more proud of my father then I was watching this video. Couldn't hold back the tears when the bird lit up the sky and music started playing. Thank you for that. Much love and happy new year from Canada!
We will always have the best new years fireworks. Prefer this to the normal around the London eye fireworks. Need to do this again next year (without covid obviously) and show off all our amazing landmarks instead of focusing on 1
YESssssssssssssssss
I love u
I can’t go anywhere for New Year so YouTube is gonna have to do lol
HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎊🎆🎈
This is emotional ❤️
Why are all other news channels acting like nothing at all happened when there was this magnificent display?? I thought BBC were just like the rest of them, I'm confused, did this actually happen?
it's been a hell of a ride
Who cares about the NHS
That was amazing. There isn’t much celebrating here in the states. Our country has turned its back on us. Not much to be proud of.
Try to reply me,
2020 is gay
Beautiful
Beautiful Magnificent and Amazing. This is not what I expected for the start of 2021. A very good way to start 2021. Happy New Year.
HAPPY NEW YEARS
Good riddance 2020.  Worst year of my 65 odd years on this earth. Thank you Rupert Murdoch.   Tucker Carlson.  Hilary Clinton.   Jeff Bezps.   Barrack Obama.   And everyone else that redirected your attentions from anything EXCEPT the undoing of  Citizens United.
It’s 2021? You know what to do now!                          *DAME DA NE*
And nice performance
I hope this year is better
!!
2020 will not be missed.  Goodbye 2020, hello 2021!

Happy new years
London, NYC, Sydney!. Best in the world. Happy new year!. 🌃💗💗
I am sitting here astonished. Well done, London. A lot of us have people to grieve. I have to grieve my Uncle.
HAPPY NEAR YEAR
Ola seu brasileiro vc por aqui
Happy new year to you all! And give some love and give out your wish for happy new year and make it a better year than last year which is 2020 but I can't believe  that it is 2021
What does Happy New Year mean when the earth is 4.5 billion years old?  4.5 billion years of oppression, slavery, ethnic cleansing, hatred, terrible wars, traumatic disasters, death and disease!  Happy New Year for what?  More of the same?  What else is there to expect in the New Year?  What the hell is NEW about it?  Certainly not the blessings of Kwanzaa:  Unity, Self-Determination, Responsible Work, Cooperative Economics, Purpose, Creativity and Faith.  Do you plan to incorporate these sacred principles into your New Year Resolutions?  Or do you just want to cop out on dietary and addiction promises you have been unable to keep throughout numerous New Year Resolutions?  Why have you been unable, even incapacitated, to adhere to these resolutions that have repeatedly failed you throughout ridiculously repetitive resolutions that fail you every year?  Why?  Because you do not understand the sacred principles of Kwanzaa, and are unable to genuinely open your life to receive these principles in your mean and anguished hearts.  Is that not so?  If you want a Happy New Year, share you ugliest, darkest, most brutal secrets hidden in your deeply oppressed emotional closets with God!  Be boldly honest and frightfully brave enough to deliver your personal sins into the loving and forgiving arms of God.  Otherwise, you can go back to being Born Again each New Year, and dying faster, more miserably, hatefully, greedily, selfishly and desperately with each Promise to God that you willingly fail to keep.  Do not blame yourself.  You are surrounded by lying demons that seek to coddle you into your vain acceptance of the stylish Hell you call High Society!  Pity!
Everyone: "Finally 2020 is over..."  2021: "I'm about to destroy the Earth here."
Beautiful. I really love this.
2021 countdown.....yawn 🥱
hopefully 2021 isn't worse
HAPPY NEW YEARSSS
Happy New Year!!!!!!! 2021 here we come!
Happy New yearrr!!!!
Didn't like the blah blah bs narrative overtop it. Spastic music clips. 2021 is the Year of Soap! Still much better than Dubai!

Extraordinary.....as 2021 should be.....Happy Blessed NEW YEAR......
Soooo well done! Bravo
Happy New Year
So far the best fireworks and laser beams used to tribute real hero’s. Thank you NHS.🌹❤️❤️❤️
Hate technology but these drones were ok. Not great but ok. The fireworks display was crap though. Just random waste of £££s. Could have made it look much better and there was far to much smoke half way through to see anything. I wonder which celeb / political prat or elite breaks lockdown 1st 😆
UMMMM HELL NO, NICE LIGHTS BUT CUT THE CRAP WITH THE COVID PROPAGANDA ALREADY...NICE SUBLIMINAL MESSAGING ATTEMPT/ LAME
I love it from London.
awesome messages and really well done. Happy New Year!
Awesome 👍 Missing my nephew working as a nurse in NHS UK...teary eyes watching this. Keep safe 🙏 and be home soon in 🇵🇭.
Happy New Year United Kingdom people 2021.🎉 God bless Everyone.

Anyone else get emotional
get rid of the fireworks and keep everything else The drone technology was awesome BRAVO
Been watching this show on YT since 2008. Finally saved enough to travel to London in 2020. Now this COVID thing scrapped my plans. Hoping I can be there to welcome 2022.
2021 will be peaceful. Happy New Year 2021
Lot's Of Love London & England I'm From India God Bless You London(England)👌🏻👍🏻❤🇮🇳🙏🏻🚩
Happy new year everybody!
What a great video! Loved it🥺❤
Soo epic!!!
Guys help me it's decber 32 HELP I'M STUCK
The iconic bigben ❤️❤️❤️
Pretty sure people would rather just try to forget about it for a night but nope, keep ramming it down our throats. Nightingale hospitals erected in 9 days? Big deal, they never used them. This is just more propaganda. ☹️
Cringey
😱, it is so 🤩 amazing,,!,
Everyone on New Years 2021: "2020 is finally over, everything is back to normal!"  2021: *"Humankind has no idea, was lies ahead for them.. "*
wow men.. London just rocked it 😭😭😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
For all that Marxist grandeur, they couldn't quite drown out that police siren at the end there... What happened? - did another citizen journalist post a video of an empty hospital?? _Ominous._
Wonderful of London. The Classic city on the world. Thanks God.
This gives me goosebumps, WOW 😯
London is the best city in the world that can confront and win over any difficulties. Long live London and the NHS.
Loved this ♥️
Wow
finally after this corona is gonna finish 😭😭😭😭😭😭
loved it great show
Happy new year
Wish there was no talking. No wants to that bull.....
The message contains is very heavy and tells the summary on what 2020 brings..  Amazing as always
🍾🇹🇹🎆✨🎇🎊🎉🥂🍻
I live in the us and their is 16 mins left til 2021
Wow . Love it as always. Though i no longer live in England I still feel i have to watch new year celebration in London
"A year of hope"   Pointing at Wembley Stadium.. Football is coming home🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Come on you England
This is fantastic. I love the pigeon
Amazing 🥰
Excellent BBC ..YOU never disappoint....thank you 🎉🎉🎉🎉HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 WITH HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎁😄
Wow!!
This is lit af🔥🙌
Let’s all clap for the flu. Wake up!
I so enjoy listening to Big Ben, but the messages didn't give hope in any way. No one likes to be reminded of a very traumatic 2020.
New Zealand: Sky Tower Australia: Harbour Bridge Taiwan: Taipei 101 UAE: Burj Khalifa UK: *The entire Greater London Area* Sorry Times Square, try better next year!
Noice mate, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!@Everyone.
This is the most beautiful fireworks I've ever seen.....sooooo beautiful
A Communist black fist of power for blm! I must've missed the Roman Salute...
crying :(
What with the Black Lies Matter shit?...👎👎👎👎🖕
Brilliant
happy new yare
As ever, a spectacular fireworks show! ... too bad the drone 'show' and some of the narative turns it into a cheap commercial.
JUMANJI!!
brilliant to watch, but also sad at the same time as there is nobody there celebrating COVID Needs to DO ONE.
Propaganda! ;)
Awesome. now pay them what they deserve!
Alicia was an amazing person to finish 2020 with and start 2021 with
This was brilliant 😁🥰
BBC - this is suppose to be a Happy New Year  occasion -- hence the word Happy --  not Corona speeches - give it a break for a few drinks --
Amazing presentation
Happy NY come to this bridge and get stabbed by a Islamic terrorist! Lovely place!
Mao loudspeakers spewing state propaganda the whole time. Perfectly Orwellian.
follow me
My routine every new year is to watch the fireworks around the world hoping one day I could see it live❤
London has it going on!! Happy New Year Everyone!! 2021!
I miss London ❤️
🤢🤮😷🤢🤮😷
Happy new year
Bird is my favorite
Omg this is the most disgraceful inhuman fireworks show I have ever witnessed
Thank you London. Just thank you. Signed, exhausted healthcare worker trying to keep the hope
Shit hole
Awesome
Apart from the 👊 in the air an excellent display.
Happy new year
Yay. Usher in your tyrannical new year, dweebs! _Enjoy the indefinite lockdown!!_
Cool
Yay it’s 2021
This is so stupid
the  CRAZY QUINN OF PANDEMY
Bloody hell!  What was that?   Who are these people?-
Spectacular - well done UK for putting on the most spectacular display and give us all pause to give thanks for what we have.  Completely lifted my spirits around the year gone by and the year ahead.
happy new year
So Amazing ! Greetings from Brazil 🇧🇷 Happy New Year Everybody !🥳
watch us all come back here 5-10 years later, dang this year was bizarre.
When they said black lives matter .  Me :bye hahaha  Bunch of terrorist .
Fantastic  well  done england stay  safe
On behalf of the MAJORITY of the U.S., THANK YOU ALL!!!  Your message will be spread far and wide over here, this I promise you.
Wow that's great
Happy 2021 guys hopefully everyone goes well and also some of you might know this some of you don’t know this but if you know W2s he did a disstrack and part of it was on the bridge and yeah happy new year good luck 🤞
Happy New Year 💕 to everyone..Hope this year brings happiness to all..
For anyone wondering, the new hour starts from the first bong. The other bongs are to be counted so londoners can work out the time.
ow my eyes hurt now but pretty cool btw happy new years!
I think UK  did something special more than other countries.
Happy New Years UK and hold Boris's feet to the fire and make him deliver on your freedom
No words. Should have sent a poet.
ALL LIVES MATTER
🔥🔥😍
So beautiful
I was in London walking my dogs tonight. There was no lights like this at all on the bridges. Nothing like this at all. There was a lot of police on the bridge. No light display like this.
be safe allhumans
With love from the USA
These fireworks looks nice
im scared in happy
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021.☺️👋🙏 PLEASE JUST THINK..... Every human is relieved that this Corona year has passed. All of us would be hoping that next year we will be FREE from painful experience of corona. But there are other living beings who are continuously suffering quietly about whom we never think and bother ie ANIMALS. These silent living beings are suffering so much but we humans never care. They are put in enclosures so small that they can't even move. They are chained and caged for life. They die of desease, extreme cold, hunger and thirst. They are killed BRUTALLY for meat.They are used for medical experiments. They are abandoned on roads to die by pet owners. They are not given food and water. Every time they are treated cruelly by humans for no reason. Humans are angry with humans but they vent out their anger on innocent animals. Animals suffer so much due to humans. But they never complain. So then why are humans so cruel to them???? They would also be expecting every moment that one day humans will treat them kindly. They will someday get freedom from chains and cages. People will feed them and take care of them when they fall ill. But their expectation is broken every moment. Humans never understand their pain. If humans were chained and put in cages similarly for life, brutally killed for meat,  treated barbarically by other humans, abandoned, left to die of desease and hunger in extreme weather conditions,  how would they feel? Why cant humans understand how animals would be feeling when their expectations are broken every time? If we cannot understand their pain then how we think ourselves worthy of being treated kindly? If humans cannot be kind to animals, who are so pure and innocent, who never hate and don't have any ego, then how can humans expect same kindness from others? SO JUST THINK.....  MAY BE THEN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY GO THROUGH EVERY MOMENT WHICH HUMANS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FACE EVEN FOR A MOMENT.  SO PL MAKE A RESOLUTION THIS YEAR THAT YOU WILL HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART FOR THEM. PL HELP ATLEAST ONE ANIMAL THIS YEAR.....YOU WILL SURELY FEEL GREAT. HAPPY NEW YEAR ONCE AGAIN.🙏
Absolutely fantastic display, couldn't have asked for a better start to the New Year. The organisers and all those who took part really outdone themselves with this one!
ace
So Wonderful & so thoughtful

Godbless london and the rest of the country keep safe and happiest new year to everyone
It’s strange to think that 2020 is over. Such a bad year, I’m glad it’s done with
Please what's the name of the song? 2:59
somebody: ''oh yess 2020 is done now''.  2021: ''Nah that was just the trailer bro''.
Big ben looking quite fresh and clean
Do they know that is the same symbol that communism uses? The fist.
i wish all of the darks ones would perish
Happy New Year from Brazil 🇧🇷
Thank you London and BBC for a great entrance into 2021!
UHUUUL
So much technology!! but to keep us under control and almost incidentally to stop our lives, we better wake up! because they are already trapping us in a dead end.😳
gg 2020
Just saw a another video that said London wasn't having any fire works!
Wowwww osm... Inke crackers pollution nhhh krte hai... Hmare diwali wale to bht pollution krte hai... 🙄🙄🙄

Holy crap that is insane I never seen something like this before!!!!!!
Hardly see the fireworks to focused on the drones that was epic does seem a bit strange I’m surprised it happened surly loads of people went n stood to watch that
Out of all the celebrations around the world, London has had the BEST so far! Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️ thank you for honoring BLM. You all brought tears to my eyes. And for using rainbows for LGBTQ, my oldest is trans. It made me so happy to see it.
Healthy New Year!
They just had to stick the BLM message in there and ruin the whole show !!ALL Lives Matter !!
This is amazingggg!!!
2021 got me in bed but the fireworks made me wake up n shout to my neighbors "happy new year everyone"
Beautiful.
Total waste of money....
Boring
That was so beautiful ✨✨HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE 🎉🎉🎉
Well we still in 2020 in Virginia we’ll be in 21 soon

Happy new year  Its my birthday 💙
THANK YOU LORD FOR THE YEAR 2020 AND HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021 TO ALL MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AROUND THE WORLD from northeast India shillong
Que bonito país
Living in Sydney, I enjoy our NYE fireworks around Sydney Harbour, cos we get to do it ahead of most of the rest of the world and, frankly, we've got Sydney Harbour and the rest of the world doesn't. This year, London has beaten us comprehensively. Good show everyone.
This is pog
I'm still in 2020
Amazing 😍😘
Wow
Wow so amazing why it didn’t show it on television this year tho good job I saw it on YouTube brilliant fireworks with bit of twists this year great work 👍🏻
New Yorkers wiii
Great tribute to Capt. Tom Moore. A man who made a difference in 2020!
There were no fireworks. This is just for the screen peeps. It’s fake.
Wtf, pollution!!!
so amazing.
Not a fan of the fake plandemic propaganda being spoonfed to us 24/7. This has to be said and we should not conform and get used to it.   ... as for the firework/light show itself, pretty incredible. Who would have thought in a year like this?
Imagine just once it hit 0 on the timer, the sky projections just said *WAVE 1 COMPLETE*
YASS GUYS ITS 4:11AM 1ST OF JANUARY  IN THE UK BUT  HAPPY NEW YEARRR!
Music sucks
I love how they included everything that happened this year like blm and the nhs it’s amazing and it’s a good way to start 2021 despite covid
I had no idea there was going to be New Year’s Eve fireworks ?!!! I missed it 😭
Happy new year 2021
22 yrs serviing the British people... And still serving..... a Filipino immigrant who calls UK my home now... No colors and ethnic background will divides us in UK together we will remain standing...  UK-IcuRN...God bless Us 🎇🎉🙏 Happy New Year 2021!!!

Beautiful
The fact that I'm still in 2020 it's just sad
Wow really Loved the display awesome job, But then they promoted BLM  the terrorist group in their celebration
Coconut Oil will help you  on fighting the virus. Drink one table spoon per day. It helps.

That’s so eerie
Wooooow that's amazing. God bless the UK 🎉

It is so beautiful abroad🇻🇳🤘
That was bloody brilliant. Well done mates!
So amazing
I want 2022 ASAP!

Please avoid firecrackers
Utterly disappointed with the BBC New Year’s  greeting. One was always looking forward to it unfortunately this year’s performance is an absolute and utter disappointment. No correlation between the events and absolute disarray of the idea of the production. BBC are losing their grip and wits .......
last song name please
I'm gonna miss my memory when I was young I'm 11 and life like that years got to move and I'm getting order in gonna turn 12 years old in August 25th 2021
When was this filmed just wondering
I get my fireworks 3 hours  early  Happy new year to everyone so that said everybody stay safe stay home and don't gather
Together we are strong, peace and love to human kind hope this entire situation will make us stronger and United, that’s the power that we have 💪
Spero autem et omnis populus qui in mundo possunt videre pompa intra sinum meum industria agro et cum equivalent vel equivalent of currency unum pupa industria.
Disgusting! Effing traitors of the BBC, Sadiq Khan, Boris, big tech and the msm. Effing cowards.  Cross the Rubicon.
That is amazing lights of a Bird in flight
Amazing
Goosebumps
2021 lets go
So classy and edgy at the same time! Bravo London!!🎉🎆🍾️
That is awesome love it. Happy New Year!
Happy New Year Everyone 🎉🍻
💗
So amazing
Dam it’s already New Years in London and it’s only just after 10:30 in New York

Didn't expect it would be so massively emotional the message the display the fireworks is much more better then ever loved it
Beautiful....it made me homesick! Happy New Year England!
Beautiful! 💕💕💕💕 Happy new year from Canada!!!
Happy New year
I don't wanna be a party pooper ,but can't help myself thinking ,if the money for the new year celebrations should had been downgraded to minimum ,instead given more cash to people to feed them & their kids !? No ?? I feel bitter/ sweet .And I also felt bad for birds flying away as birds are timid & sensitive that they can have heartattacks & die by a loud noise even ! Don't get me wrong ! I am Japanese, love fireworks ! But ,more lasers & drones will be environmentally friendly & animal friendly ! And less guilty , think of homeless people ,they should use the $$$$ to feed 'em ,too !!! Every country's government should take better care of them ! I loved BLM message by drones ,though !!! Happy new year 2021 ! A year of OX = DELIGENCE AND PERSISTENCE AND HONESTY  ! Stay safe everyone ! 💜💜💜💜🥁🐉🎵🎤🎶🎉🍾🥂🎈🎈🎈🎍🎍🎍💕💞
What a beautiful tribute to Captain Tom Moore, I'm Aussie and even this touched my heart and cry a little, the light show and the awesome drones what a magnificent way to kick off 2021. Happy new year everyone and I hope you all have an awesome 2021.
Fabulous ❤ Happy new year from Australia, Sydney 🇦🇺
Absolutely disgusting,  Vile, Woke, Lefty B S , the BBC should be shut down permanently for showing the "Black Power" fist !

Yer
Lucifer propaganda at large

"Wow! That was beautiful... Don't u find that fireworks look pretty similar to us? They must be celebrating our anniversary."  - Covid to his spouse
The leave the light on was the best one

BBC is a fake media and corrupted. Do not TRUST this media, click dislike to understand that we do not want fake and corrupted media in United States.
I’m gonna miss 2020 it was such a good year i think if it was not for COVID I would not have been so close to my family I think 2020 has opened our eyes to the world
Fantastic
Aiman
I love the passive aggressive blue and yellow lights at the start as a nod to the EU - the UK really did just self destruct by leaving it
London always had the best celebrations imp
HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!
So nice!😍
We need a tribute like this in USA
Happy new year everyone ! This was something else. Heartwarming and touching. we are all in this together have a blessed new year
7:07 Spongebob: “I’M READY!!”  That is awesome
Trust BBC to upload this at max 720p
Most woke crap I’ve ever seen.  👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Happy New Year from Perú🇵🇪❤
Happy new year!!
TRAITOR TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE !! WE WILL REMEBER YOU ALL !
Happy  2021!!
I love you my gnoc
Yes London 🇬🇧 what a display, best one ever by far. WOW, what a message that delivered, who ever arranged this tonight really, really deserves a raise 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  Happy 2021 London 🇬🇧❤️
amazing and meaningful!
oh my gosh you make so good movies ObliviousHD
You’re on mute!  Love it
London NYE Fireworks is always the best!!!
Hello Cyberpunck 2077 this is London 2021 calling!
What is the name of the song that starts at 03:29
I’ve been watching global celebrations since I was 9 and this is by far the best NYE show I have ever seen! I’m in tears. Great job, London!
Was amazing apart from the BLM bit. Why support a group that was responsible for injuring so many good UK police officers or countless deaths in America.
HAPPY NEW YEAR FROM AUSTRALIA 🇦🇺
I got goosebumps watching this.  The beauty of HOPE
I feel very proud to be British. I felt like I couldn’t say that because of our history but I proud☺️
Happy new year everyone! ❤️
¡¡¡Espectacular y conmovedor!!!
FELIZ ANO NOVO A TODOS .BEEIJOS
wow, i think this year london wins over Sydney for most creative display!
All together now...plz
Happy New Year 🎆  A great effort 👏
So was this actually live? I’m confused. Did they just say it was cancelled to stop people going out?
What's wrong with those 672 people hitting the 'dislike' button? This show is easily one of the most amazing in the world! Thank you Britain! 🇬🇧
Beautifully executed, the world is a better place because of Britain, not too many people seem to appreciate this as they should. Happy New Year from Toronto!
Hey Alisha !!
To BBC youtube moderator:  I understand you stream this in 720p60 to save bandwidth. Please upload a new 1080p60, or even 4k60 version!
2020 ChineseCovid®™ year
Wow that was amazing. And David Attenborough was exactly the right person to conclude this outstanding presentation. So much to appreciate. So glad to have it on You Tube away over here in Aotearoa New Zealand.
So amazing ❤️🇬🇧💕💖
Happy New Year
Anyone know the piece of music they used from 0:10-1:10?
Awesome, Happy New Year to everyone in the UK and the rest of the world
Amazing show!  Happy new year to all and greetings from Germany✌️
Who’s cutting onions?
Oo
Shove it down our throats .  BLM has no part here.  Preaching your liberal agenda makes this the Most miserable display in the world of fireworks.
Happy new year
Happy New Year 2021 London!
This was very uplifting. I'm sat here at 3.27am with tears in my eyes, with a bottle of wine thinking of an old friend who died yesterday of covid 19.
This beats the usual fireworks we have every year!
Wonderful London🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🎆🎇✨
Yeyyy let's use new year's day as an excuse to contaminate that water!!!
NICE FIREWORKS, SPECTACULAR, CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!
beautiful... London won
In a vegan world there would be no Covid, go vegan it starts with u, don't pay for animal abuse

Shite
Wow England. Congratulations for this meaningful, beautiful, and unforgettable display. It’s so mesmerizing, and 2020 cannot be forget, the world fought together to fight the virus. Thanks BBC for delivering this amazing video.

Seriously? We were supposed to celebrate new year and first year of independence and you've done nothing else than your propaganda.
Damn knott in my throat
Salutes David Attenborough
Cheers to 2021! 🥂 from Canada 🇨🇦
Ah , this made me so emotional, what a year 2020 has been! It’s been such a difficult and tough year for everyone and the arrival of 2021 is definitely like a breath of fresh air for all of us. Here’s to happier 2021! I wish y’all prosperity, happiness and good health!

A WORLD of DIFFERENCE = DESTROY THE LEFT & Expose the Climate change TOTAL LIES.  BURN COAL it's 100% Natural. & very Efficient.  INSTALL a LOG Fire in your home NOW WHILE YOU CAN !!  Never Rely on Gov'ts to Keep you warm. But Nature Will always Deliver.
Happy new year 2021 !!
Year 2021 anh covid 20😂
Never seen a brainwashing agenda being pushed so hard by all these Jimmy Saville lovers
The best celebration 🎉  Happy new year everyone 😊
Really? Beautiful fireworks but really?
This is so beautiful
Happy New Year's❤💙❤💙❤💙
Amazing... and massage from David Attenborough is precious 🐝🌱🐙
Goodbye 2020 you were a pain in the A*s ill give you that
I hope this year is going to be worse
Much better than 2020 fireworks display and 2020 itself!
assuming this was put on by the City of London... the current gov may not be as quickly to try and dismantle it in favor of a privatized version of the "NHS" but they will try the second people stop paying attention.
Bruh, we finna get Ai's this year.
London definitely won the title of best display globally!
A HARD LEFTIST PROPAGANDA VIDEO, Similar to 1939 Marxist Germany. Pre WW2.
Happy new year 2021❤💟🤩🤩
WOAHHHHH
Nice subtle EU nod at the beginning there
Rest In Peace all those kinda souls who lost their lives this year. Remember love over hate. To a bright future!🥂
Happy new years🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉
I don't understand guys, why would they caution us or warn us that this program has flashing images. I don't know call me weird but that's the only thing that stuck out in my mind. I guess that's what they call a suspicious mind????
Woooow
❤️NHS
Beautiful 😍
2:56 🥺🥺
UTTERLY VILE &DISGUSTING to EVEN MENTION the VIRUS & NHS on NEW YEARS EVE AT MIDNIGHT.  FUCKIN DISGUSTING POPAGANDA.
Hallo  London 2021.......
What a ridiculous waste of money... give those millions to the NHS instead... New Year, same shit...
What's the song at 7:40 marker
Which song was it when the bird design came up?
Disgusting BLM should not be promoted it is a racist anti white Marxist political organisation.
I wanted to stay here...😭
Amazing, I love it, but next year we will get the fireworks coming from the London eye and people will be there, it would have been even better but we know this is all we are going to get, but next year, the firework displays will just keep getting better and better and we will see people around the London eye mesmerised by all the beautiful fireworks, how did they make those pictures in the air?
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021 🎉 🎆
🎆🎆🎇🎇🎇🎇🎇🎆
I Feel Hope
damn brilliant but try to keep politics out of it next time.. thanks.
Amazing!  Very unique London,!🎊🥂👌❤️
See you im march london and please take care of me.
This is way cooler than the ball drop in NYC. Holy shit
happy new year
I didn’t think we were going to have fireworks this year, but, this was the best show EVER! A good boost to start 2021. Loved the light show. STUNNING 😍😍
❤️2021 thank you NHS
The British sure know how to celebrate
new year
Unexpected and brilliant. Captured 2020 with honesty, the perfect tone of humour and hope for a brighter future.  A year of pent up frustration and worry, comes crashing out in floods of tears to the voice of Sir David. Deep breaths...
Fake and gay
Happy New Year from San Francisco!!!, CA
Top
Thank you London! We can do this!!!!
2012 fireworks are still the best. Sorry, but like if you agree. The Olympic year and the fact that fireworks came out of Big Ben made it the best.
😯😯😯😯
I'm convinced this is the best display I've ever seen!!🥰🥰❤️ happy new years from Texas guys!!
It was the most beautiful New Year's show in the world and ever
I am here only to give BBC my thumb down
Awesome
This is the most touching new years display that could ever be shown i dont think it cpuld ever be beaten, the messages was just so touching i just love love love so amazing x

To those who have downvoted this... its NEVER too late to make a difference, to learn something new, to see that the world is just waiting for you! I send LOVE AND HOPE to EVERYONE HERE!
THEY JUST COPIED CHINA WHAT CHINA DID LAST YEAR WITH THE DRONE IMAGE SHOW
That's why London is being my dream city.
Happy New Year England....what a show!!!
Happy new year’s eve

All lives are Matter.
Happy new year to all of us in Britain and together we will get through this! :) Stay safe
Amazing❤️
LONDON HAS DONE IT AGAIN..BEST FIREWORK DISPLAY IN THE WORLD..What a surprise...I didn't think there was going to be any display this year. It had everything. Drones, light shows, lasers, plus a commentry telling the moving story of 2020. And not forgetting the fireworks. Whoever planned and organised this year should be given a medal. Nice to see different landmarks used. So many highlights, one after another, each one important to remember. Thanks BBC TV for great directing and camera work. REMEMBER, 2021 A YEAR OF HOPE.
Dope...Fire...Fantastic!!!
Obvious propaganda is obvious. Let people escape from their crappy lives for a little bit at least....
Wow its amazing 🎇🎆✨
And I actually thought there won't going to do anything 😘❣️❣️
Happy new year to all  Very nice 👍
Wonderful,Stunning,Mind Expanding,thank you LONDON and it's Mayor Sadiq Khan?
LONDON NEVER DISAPPOINTS.
Wanthus yt
This is Great......Britain.
Drink and move to Silly  Isle
Happy New Year  2021 💞
Happy new year everyone! Let’s hope 2021 is a better year 🤞
BLM gets a mention but ISIS doesn't? That's racist!
So emotional... this is how we all wish it was but unfortunately the real world doesn't live up to these wonderful messages of hope.  I think that's what made me cry.
Happy 2021 folks :)
All lives matter
I feel proud today of our great City!!!
720p upload is CRAP!
Rest in peace adobe flash player we will all miss you with our hearts
Just a date on a calendar.. All in the  mind..
Propaganda at its finest here 😆. What a joke!
Hello London Tier 5
2021 wow i remember when covid 19 was announced
Very strange not seeing crowds of people out along the Thames... but it was wonderful seeing more of London than just the area around Westminster Bridge. (Even all the way out to Wembley.)
Happy New Year!!!!!!
Happy 2021 london!
and me waiting for the new year in 10min at brazil
it is 953
Fabulous! Great job, London!
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE    2021
in california watching this.... i miss my mum , she's in london
They forgot auld Lang slyne
Lovely fireworks but crap music can't stand today's music give me the 60s 80s music anytime.
Let's make it a great new year for all of the planet's creatures...after we scare the shit out of every bird and house pet in an 8 km radius with the biggest wad of explosives we've ever seen.
Just amazing technology   What a surprise 😍😍😍
Incredible. I never saw this coming.
Here in the USA , peace find you all over the world.  Jesus is with us a nd you
2:57 tell me song name please
Amazing!!!
Amazing! A blessed New Year for everybody!
Amazing! --Bonnie Robinson
You lost me at the communist fist flown by those who burned down my friends store and turned my city into a dump full of shattered windows.
Who watched this and then 2020 to see how life has changed😂
More Drones! Less Fireworks!
My last comment for this year 🎆
Very very very beautiful 🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊 cheers hapy new yer
I was enjoying the mix of fireworks and commentary, but they lost me when they started this Black Lives Matter (Better Love Mao) garbage. I do not subscribe to a movement whose leaders are IN THEIR OWN WORDS "trained Marxists". BOOOOO!
They won the best in the century so far, imo
2021 is the *"HOPE"*
Fireworks done by the people who made us cry last year... Stay together and united
This one really hits emotional and amazing display hope for 2021
😭😭😭😭
L O V E 😍😍😍😍😍😍 2😍21 O N D O N
2021 will be the best year...God is there...
Brilliant and beautiful I loved it !!🤩
Beautiful. Happy New Year. 😍😍😍
This made my cry!😭 even tho because of the virus 🦠 everyone has learned a lot this year!♥️ and I say this have been the best video/firework show ever!!🥺
Did that even happen??? I mean with everyone trapped in their homes how can we be sure. This seems very dystopian. Let people out on ONE NIGHT FOR G*D’S SAKE.
💯G2❤4❤2G💯
Nice one video
They really kept this a secret ahah ! I wasn’t expecting to see fireworks this year I was a little sad. these were so beautiful and wasn’t as big as usual but had way more value and meaning I will never forget about 2020. We made history ! Wishing everyone a safe healthy 2021   Stay safe 💕
This feels a little like YouTube rewind in a good way.  Vary appropriate for them to remember the hard year we had.
Happy Independence Day Britain!!  Thank you Sir Captain Thom !! We love you all the way from Utah USA.
so upset I didn't see this live, I'd heard they weren't doing a display this year so didn't watch anything :'( I thought this was cancelled this year??? Loads of articles and the BBC themselves even said that the fireworks show was cancelled! I'm so confused
This is much better than pop danthology
Can someone please tell me the name of the song at 5:29??
Semplicemente SPETTACOLARE.
And so cool
**** lgbt
Wow!!  This is totally amazing❣️ The light show fantastic❣️ the music fabulous, it goes so well with the light display❣️  This whole show should win awards, it’s bloody marvellous. I do not agree with blm but everything else was great.
I thought it would mention Brexit and the vaccine
Lockdowns 2021: no longer a bug, now a feature!!! Yes it’s 2021.
HappyNewYear$
Unfortunately... too late for me to be deported.  Oh, well.... keep on been EU Citizen... life sorted out in my 🇪🇸, if only... any chance to be kicked out, please?   Fully qualified and tax payer always....
This is the year Big Ben rings again.
Happy New Year

happyhappyjoyjoy new year !

2020 was a bad year because of coronavirus
Chancellor
Happy New Year!! Thank you, England for a grand display!!
Que ridicules si tienen a la gente encerrada y prendiendo fuegos ridiculous  suelten a la gente abusivos
Cancelled my TV license Monday....Alex and Jim Davidson bringing the truth
Add a public comment
Honestly this is one of the worst firework displays ever
OMG do people think letting a load of fireworks off which probably cost a fortune that covid is going to piss off. What a load if shit.
Lord chancellor
Extraordinary!!!👏👏👍👍👍 Thank you London!!
Here we go, 2021
London had the BEST displays on the planet.  Thank you for the "Blue Bird" and the Black Lives Matter tribute.  Bless you London. 🕛🥂🙏🏽💜
Every life matters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As an NHS worker, We all matter.
Countries: "we'll make the best fireworks show for new years!" Britain: "hold my crumpets"
Black lives Matter are Marxists. All Lives Matter.
happy new year! I always miss london. CHEERS EVERYONE - From South Korea
Having to watch this again cos I was in awe at the drones the first time! Way better than the fireworks!
So beautiful.....❤️🙏🏻
Big blue bird was the best!
The annual "Let's scare the living shit out of some birds" convention, wonderful :D
BLM 👎🏿
Bloody brilliant.  It was nice to escape the drudgery of covid for a few minutes. Here's hoping for a better 2021.
Happy New Year, UK from America! Let’s hope this year people come together in love!
Oh my goodness! This is too beautiful for words! Happy New year Everyone, it's definitely going to be a wonderful year.
🌟🌟IF BORIS JOHNSON HAS DONE ONE THING RIGHT PAST 10 MONTHS..... IT WAS 100% THIS 💯
Very emotional but as usual the music is dire, Britain has produced some of the greatest music over years, mix up the music, tonight starts off with the great Bowie then goes into the modern crap music that most of the country never heard of, the celebrations should be for everyone not just 20somethings, apart from the music, i loved it, good job London.
God bless you Sir David
This should be the blueprint for future NYE displays in London, it was brilliant!
2021 Freedom Independence and Democracy 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Christ Jesus Bless you all 🍥🍥🍧🍧😊😊🍨🍨🎂🎂🍡🍡
happy new year😆
Go to hell BBC
My goodness I'm astounded by this fantastic display. Love and heartfelt best wishes to my fellow brits and everyone around the world. Hope you all have a happy, healthy and peaceful New year 😊
This is so cool
Loved this. Thank you.  Missing home and familly ❤ Good luck everyone. WE GOT THIS 👍👍👍👊👊🥂❤
I wish the US did amazing displays like this, all we get is a ball drop 😂 whoopti doo
Are fireworks eco-friendly
Yass
Unfuckingbelievable
HOW AMAZING WAS THIS.. Them drone images was just superb. Loved it!
Greetings from America first of all I want to say happy New Year's to London England the Queen of England and the people themselves and their families God bless your hearts and you're souls Stay safe and sound and we're going to make it to the other side but all of us are going to make it to the other side I'm out together hand-in-hand I can't wait to visit England and to come down to the record shops and the places to eat when we get back to our normal God bless you guys thanks so much have a good one cheers🇺🇸🎊🇬🇧😷😊
Wish a very happy new year to all of you who scrolling down
wow... lots of cheesy, virtue signalling, really ruins the important messages in this.... drones were cool though. Would have been cooler to do more light tricks like projecting onto the buildings instead of cramming so many fireworks into the small area they had to work with. Wonder if the choreographer is a discworld fan...
Very nice
Okay who did them drone lights where AMAZING WELL DONE AND A GREAT THANKS this made my cry this was just amazing.
oh my how crass, do the right thing and release Julian Assange you fucks
Thanks, London!  That was a beautiful message of Hope for 2021...Love from Charlotte, North Carolina
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYBODY!!!
yes black live matter
Not impressed- was better in Moscow  : just fireworks without political bull.  Togetherness- that’s a joke!  The world does not give a damn about my country- Armenia . Somehow no one came up with ALM!  Мир стал идиотским -
𝖩𝗎𝗌𝗍 𝖻𝖾𝖺𝗎𝗍𝗂𝖿𝗎𝗅 ......𝖦𝗈𝗈𝖽 𝗋𝗂𝖽𝖽𝖺𝗇𝖼𝖾 𝗍𝗈 𝗍𝗁𝖾 𝗌𝗁𝗂𝗍𝗍𝗂𝖾𝗌𝗍 𝗒𝖾𝖺𝗋 𝖾𝗏𝖾𝗋!                                                          🧻
Happy New Year 2021!
*I hope that one day I can get over 2020. Now, I can never look at life the same way again. God forbid I never smile again.*
Happy new Year to all! New year, a new direction for a better life experience! To the one reading this, may your most important desire be  fulfilled this new year!
So amazing super super 🙌👌👌👌
This is spectacular! 😊🎉🎊
Happy New Year, greetings from the Philippines ✨🇵🇭
So amazing well done to all x
god thank you
As an American I’m jealous 12/31/2020
Amazing!! 🥳🥳🥳 welcome 2021 🥰
They said the firework display was cancelled in Sept, so why then have a firework display and not allow people to come down and enjoy it?
Absolutely beautiful, happy new year all 🍾🥳
BigUP Captain Tom!
Happy New Year!! What an incredible show!!
Happy New Year Welcome 2021
❤❤Omg! Only 30 seconds in I Cried like a proper Wetty soppy bollocks ❤❤
We left the EU and not even a sparkler!! Tells you everything!!
I'm getting goosebumps just seeing this 😃
Oh dear, I should get off here really quickly as it is full of people who love the BBC and believe every thing that they are fed through their air waves.  It was the most nauseating thing that I have ever seen.  This government has destroyed the country and brought untold misery to milllions but people still think this display was worth mentioning.  The NHS which is not treating people with life threatening illnesses is still so bloody great, give me strength.  Wake up you muppets and start reading something other than the msm.  2021 will be far worse than 2020 unless people rise up against the evil.
"So many of the nurses, doctors and consultants, aswell as cleaners guiding us through this storm are black Asian minority ethnic"  Thanks for basically saying all white people are useless and doing nothing for the united Kingdom. And then follow it with BLM  Just a big middle finger to white people. What a disgrace.
it is so touching while watching it tonight.  Allow me to salute NHS again and say appreciation to all guys.  I am from HK to London just few weeks but can feel all the warm welcome always 😊
Goodbye On 2020 Welcome 2021
This is next level! Happy New Year everyone and hope this year goes better.
Let's see how NYC, USA will top that!
Happy New Year to everyone especially for the people stuck at home like me🥳🥳🥳🥳💯💯💯🔥🔥
Happy New Year On Goodbye 2020 And Hello 2021
this is lit
No classic British music icons AGAIN. Where were BOWIE (a tiny, apologetic snatch from 'LET'S DANCE' at the start), JOHN LENNON, MATT MONRO, THE WHO, QUEEN, DUSTY SPRINGFIELD, ELTON JOHN, KATE BUSH, THE ROLLING STONES, TOM JONES, U2, SWEET, THE EUTHYTHMICS, JAMIROQUAI, SADE, THE KINKS, THE BEATLES, ETC ETC!  Sir David Attenborough was the perfect climax. But he could and should have had a rousing musical build up! Are we Brits ashamed of our magnificent musical history???
Best celebration ever i have tears in my eyes 😢
Should’ve done like this much earlier than this covid situation. Looking fresh and efficient. Good job London!
ANOTHER SONG OF LITTLE MIX FOR THE NEXT YEAR PLEASE, THEY DESERVED 🤝🏽🎆
incredible
Happy New Year to all 🎊🎉
My eyes are fill of 2021 happy new year🤗🤩😍😊😀😁
Thank you London.... that was special ❤❤🇬🇧🇬🇧❤❤xxx
4 more hours til we make it to 2021 in Texas. Glad y'all made it.  Stay home and stay safe. Glad y'all handled it better than we did.
Happy New Year    All the best!
Miles better than that ferris wheel crap! = keep the drones, bridges, dome, shard, Wembley, as part of next years display please! :)
Don’t be so daft, naysayers! 2021 will be much better.
Man that is awesome amazing wonderful great stuff happy new year London England and America and world have a safe happy and healthy new year
I used to like reflecting on my personal life and deriving my own meaning out of the New Year fireworks, but this year I put myself on the side for the NHS, BLM and being a good obedient socialist instead.
This is spectacular - made me cry too! What an impressive display this is. It just reinforces the hope that we have going into the new year. Beautiful!
Awesome! I cried hard!
Wow...so classy..happy new year UK 🇬🇧 from the USA 🇺🇸..still 3 hours to go here
This is fake ! Computer generated
UK ❤️
Best firework display ever
😘😘😘
Fantastic and very unique alternative to the usual new year celebration.
BLM 🖤RIP pop smoke RIP kobe RIP Chadwick bosseman king RIP juice wrld RIP king Von happy new year 🥳 2021 going back to normal lives ✊🏾🎆🌌
Happy new year 2021
No matter how much we struggle in such situation,living one in diversity ,love and help together...with my warm wishes very happy new year to all..
So are those drones?? Is there a video showing how they did this?
Happy NY London! From California. Sending you much love and well wishes to each and everyone one of you. Waiting for NY now:-)
Big Ben is going to look sharp when finished
Why spend all this money on fire works when we are not allowed to go and watch them?
2:54 what name music
HAPPY NEW YEAR ENGLAND!
This made me so emotional! 2020 has been full of sadness. I hope this year brings happiness , love and success in everyone’s lives ! Ameen.
Never thought fireworks this year would make me cry. They were so shit last year I didn't bother watching and thought I'd give this a go.  I lost my dad in sept. thankfully not Covid but it was bad cardiac arrest and he couldn't get out to get fitter because of it. It tarnished what we could've been doing together. And I only hugged him once this year. ONCE!
Happy new year! Wishing a year of good health and lots of smiles 💕 would have loved to see this in person, beautiful fireworks and drone tech!
It had me in tears beautiful display well done xxx
oh politics at fireworks now
Long live the English Empire. Our "Language" is the World's Language, therefore our empire is the world's empire. Peace and love to all.
A beautiful tribute to ring in the new year.
That looks like an Avengers level threat...
What ever happens in 2021.. just remember we are stronger together. Look to the future not in the past. We can do this.. because we have each other.
Happy New Year
Hola, les escribo desde donde aun 2020  diganme : como entrar al futuro, que llevo pal 2021
I love the displays but only if the the camera stayed still and kept on zooming in on the bored bc it was always when it was the really cool parts
♥️
Happy New Year folks! I hope 2021 is a better year for everyone. Peace.
6:06  I'm sorry looking at this bit, we are celebrating people who call themselves the minority while there are enough of them to really trash and burn down the place, which they did.  All so they can be recognized in a country that they usually not native to when tracing back less than two generations.  Look I've got nothing against my personal ethnic friends but when I see crowed of them jumping around for identity politics (ideology)  I think they would of been part of Hitler's regime if they were excepted.  They do not take responsibility for themselves they expect others to bear that burden for them
I do hope that this New year Brings lots of Happiness an joy in to each an every one's life's.
This display was amazing I’ve got to admit but it’s kinda funny and tragic how at the end David Attenborough is talking about combatting climate change and making a world for all inhabitants while at the same time the pollution fills the air from fireworks and the birds are flying away scared out of their minds -I love fireworks as much as the next person but the real star of the show was this drone display! Just goes to show at our best humans are creative and innovative and we can progress and adapt if we want to! Here’s to a better year ahead. Happy new year all!
So much better without the usual cameras cutting to watch public watching the display,,i watched the fireworks which is normally lot better then the coverage from @skynews  who only shows mostly scotland or ovsr excited reporters asking stupid questions,whoever created this piece is a genius,well done👏 especially loved nightingale 🐥and David Attenborough 🐢there one piece could've done without ALL! live matter!
Happy 2021 everyone! Be strong, stay blessed, and remain awesome! God loves you! ❤️
WoW theirs Fireworks in London!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😍👏
Amazing 😉
I laughed, then hard-core cried during this. Thanks for sharing BBC ❤
Well done to everyone involved, it was truly amazing xx
BBC's program has always been so touching. Tears are in my eyes when I see the celebration!!!
Happy new year everyone, 2021 be amazing.
Ok
As an American.... PLEASE STEP YOUR FIREWORKS GAME UP, MURICA! This was GORGEOUS and had a very beautiful  message.
Wow
I miss you London 🥳🥲🍾🎆
BEST NEW YEARS DISPLAY EVER USING MULTIPLE LOCATIONS THE O2, WEMBLEY STADIUM AND THE TOWER BRIDGE,
happy new year 2021 🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅
Just one word amazing  Happy New year 🎊
Thank you London!  We're still waiting to kick this year out here in the USA along with the current administration! Gotta be a brighter future.  Never felt so connected with you and everyone around the planet.  We're bonded from 2020, the only bright side.  Happy New Year!
🙏
Let there be light!!! 🎇😉
🙏🤝🙏
This was just amazing. Time to move forward.
Nice Firework Desplay. But this new year Totally different from every other year. An too you all at the BBC. Have a fantastic New year's 2021. Thank you for sharing this video.
Why are they aren’t doing it on the London eye?
I was waiting for this moment on my TV and finally at twelve a clock it came. Goodbye 2020,Hello 2021.
Happy New Year 2021 to ALL
What a fantastic end to one hell of a year. Happy New Year from Canada.
Plot twist: Drones will replace fireworks by 2050
Falcon or eagle?
Pure class by London! Showing appreciation, unity, sustainability and a reflective but hopeful end to the year. Beautiful!
I think I can speak for everyone they should do this every new year but make it different so good job guys ❤️
I wish you all a blessed 2021. Let's all try to remain positive.  Love from Jamaica
WOW! Amazing guys!
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwww, this.....is just amazing bro, i can't describe it with just words
Beautiful.  The Blue Bird was amazing.  Great show. Wish I could have been there in person to witness.  Happy New Year from Las Vegas,  Nevada.
I remember BLM organisation who knock down statues - fist to the air and bend the knee...
Nothing like a political message to Start the New Year!! Don't forget People 'Black Lives Matter'!!!!!
The drone idea is much better than only fireworks that after one minute the smoke will cover every thing in the show
Happy New Year 2021
Emotionally beautiful x
I was so mesmerized by the drone light show ❤️ Happy New Year 🥳
it  was  the best  of  the best   Happy  New  Year  from  Palm  Springs  California
Feliz 2021 Q impresionante tecnologia y pirotecnia, grandioso. Saluds d Mex. Deseando paz, amor y salud este 2021 Para todos.
Best propaganda ever.. Well done UK wow 👍
London brings it AGAIN!
FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE BBC , There was No firework disply in London at all??????????????
Watch SHEZ WORLD channel for more London New Year 2021 fireworks display!
Incredible and very well done.
It’s all fun and games  until it turns in to Far From Home and the drones start attacking people
Thank you so much for posting this!! Because I missed it on the tv..
Cried through the whole thing
Why  honour a Marxist extremist group that despises our democracy and values? Read their manifesto. BS propaganda. All lives matter.
Meh I preferred it when it was just fireworks tbh
I was keeping it together until I heard David Attenborough's voice
I had to watch this twice. Best ever done and good weather. Shame we couldn’t watch in person. Thank you. Amazing. So creative. Hope we didn’t frighten too many pets and birds. Happy new year everyone
This made me cry properly for the first time since I was put on medication for my mental illnesses. I’ve had to be strong for my family, who mostly work for the NHS and have massive strain on them all year, so if I cried, they would suffer. Finally, after 10 months of holding it in for the year, now my parents are asleep, I have cried; and let me tell you, I’ve never been more relieved to cry so hard in my life.  Thank you 💜
Happy New Year 2021
Humans: invent holograms First thing they do: put giant hearts in the sky  Very nice display this year. Much better than the mess last year (which in hindsight feels like an omen for 2020). Hopefully this bodes well for 2021.
So proud to be British 🇬🇧 Happy New Year everybody xxXxx
Beautiful!!! Happy New Year from the USA!
Praising the NHS when 70k+ workers called in sick in a day and a marxist organisations logo used in the display. Flabbergasted
That's the worst display ever ...in a year that has to be the worst on record for alot of people why couldn't they leave covid out of it and just make it fun ...sad
Oh my gosh that was so incredibly awesome and inspiring and touching just a wonderful show thanks London
It’s wasn’t just a new year fireworks show, it was a message of hope, faith and love to everyone from everyone. Thank you for that❤️Happy New Year 🕊❤️💕🕊🌺🌈💫🌎🌏🌍🎇
Should never be BLM garbage in the display
Blm are hated by 90% of the country
yes a year with no cameras on the crowds so i can just enjoy the fireworks and drones
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE
Happy new year May this year bring happiness and prosperity to your lives
Happy New Year Everyone. That was beautiful, thank you BBC.
Too much propaganda.  Liked the technology with drone display and the lights...  They used it to push agendas though.
Happy new year 2021 wish you all the best
I knew it, the earth is flat
This was so beautiful, London you make me proud !
Amazing until they started with the blm shit
London your awesome!
Amazing.    Happy new. Year.   Everyone.   Let's. All keep. Safe.    And. Get back to a normal.  Life.
Amazing!!!
waste of money    why don't they donate instead??????
hope u guys have a happy new year i hope that 2021 is the best year :D
Wow, you know just wow!!!
Garbage...not sure why we need a box-ticking, politicised fireworks display.  Thankfully Jools Holland is on the other side.
ขอบคุณทุกองค์กรณ์เเละเพื่อนเเบะเครีอญาติเเละขอบคุณชาวคณะบิกไบร์จงมีความสุขของสมปราณธณาเเฃะความเจริญ
Omg i missed i thought they said there wasnt one😁😗

I got goosebumps when watching this on tv
Happy new year
Just Fukien amazing 🤩🥳👍
That is freakin impressive! 2021 will be a better year!

Everythingareverygoodlooking
Disgusting putting that BLM message in there. Whoever had that idea needs to be fired!
Hey wheres the people
She was amazing 🤩 no words do describe, well done 👍 so talented 👏👏👏
Love it!!

Beautiful fireworks display
Great use of the fog.
Happy new year from Philippines 😊👍
Hallo  my friend   my chnal  suBCRIBE  pellls
Tutorial completed
happy 2021.
What we have no money ...your kidding me ...music crap ..Thats London ..Im a Londoner ..Bullshit ..BBC ..My god that is so insipid ...Think I will throw up...Im a Londoner ..no soul ..crap
Damn
One of the best and the most inspirational fireworks !
They did their best for me still better than just fireworks really liked the social messages
These are beautiful. So happy to get to watch them from the U.S.
I just love ❤️ it. It’s so beautiful.
Guess what, absolutely nothing about Brexit being finally over.
my love from Brazil
Great choreography and love how they used drones and also other landmarks in London rather than the same old London Eye 👍👍 shame they had to put in all the Covid, nhs and BLM crap. Can we just shut up about all that please, tired of it. Can we start 2021 by living life as normal and opening up the country before we descend into even deeper economic disaster?
Are you for real black lives matter you actually put that racist Marxist movement in the new year London fireworks display that's how I know this country is being taken over by Marxist ideology ALL LIFE Matters!!!!
I LOVE THIS!!! HAPPY NEW YEAR!! :)
Happy New Year to all beautiful souls 💛  love light blessings 🙏😊
Hallo my woold  people   i am sri  lanka ....happy  new eya  ..my friend .i love you jepan

happy new year England !
Welcome New Year Eve Fireworks!! Have A Blessed Happy New Year 2021 😍🌈🔆🎉
This was brilliant by far the best display ever! David Attenborough at the end tho😍
Australia: Let's have a big New Years fireworks display at the harbor bridge. Dubai: Let's have a big New Year fireworks display around the Burj Khalifa. England: Nah, a fireworks display around Westminster is too small so let's do one across the whole of London. 🤣🤣🤣 What a way to show the world why Great Britain is so Great. Well done BBC!!!
Ngl when it became 2021, I cried tears of happiness cause 2020 is finally gone. 😭❤️
Happy New Year 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Happy New Year 2021 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Yay
Nice propaganda
who gives a shit
Emotional 🥺 feel like I’m appreciating people and the world a lot more now  pray for better days 🙏🏾🤞🏾💪🏾❤️💙
I hope they implement the drums into the normal new year celebrations now. A perfect way to finish an imperfect year. Thank you London and whoever was a big enough genius to think of this.   That was a perfect summary of our year in 10 minutes. One wish is that this now doesn't get hatted on for supporting BLM but personally no problems to be mad about this from the on mute moment to the thanking NHS even to the unprecedented level of 2020 and how the UK takled it as individuals and as a whole country. This is a modern peice of art and this will go down as history as my highlight to a unprecedented horrible, for some people even, petrifying, year. THANKS LONDON for yet again going above and beyond even my wow this is amazing expectations. lost for words about how good this is.from the start diversity speach 'the hated on speach' to the global warming speach at the end I LOVED it. Keep crashing my expectations like you're on the moon. Thanks London. And I want to give shout-outs to my dad, who works as a NHS medicine delivery guy and by night a shop keyworker and all other keywords in any field. If I was in a government with unlimited money I would give you all a million pounds, even the teachers. THANK You for making the good things in 2020. Uk citizens London has given us this amazing show of 2020 now don't mess it up by saying 'it was too political' and if you do complain I will say 2 things 1) it's the 21st century is the only thing we can agree on is Boris's Johnson is and looks like a sausage roll.     *JOKE* 2)we have a nice thing in this country called 'the freedom of speech' so they can say whatever they like and you can too but your voice is terrible and noone likes it so shut up already *JOKE*  Once again I want to thank 4 people 1)thank you to any and all types of keyworkers teachers, builders, doctors all counts and of any and all level for newbies to full time amazing people. 2) thank you to double keyworkers. 3)thank you to London for blowing all my expectations out the water  4) thank you for reading all of this message if you haven't then you better *JOKE*  I will leave you with this amazing joke I invented.  The keyworkers must not be that good because 2020 won.
Happy New Year everybody. Hope 2021 will be a better year than 2020
We have finally reached 2021 and I hope everyone has had a really bless full year best of wishes guys
Whoever did this did an awesome job
I was expecting a montage of previous years. This was honestly an amazing surprise, a great way to start 2021.
Absolutely incredible!
BLM, ew
6:41 there's Wembley stadium
Beautiful 👏🥂💓
Defund the BBC!
Beautiful! Thanks for all the call outs to hero's too. The sad fact is there will be a desperate need for many nurses and careworkers after the pandemic is over.
America loves you London! 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Wonder how many complaints there will be for saying black lives matter in the millions I'm guessing still stand by it and always will
Aww, this really got to me. We all felt it.
I missed it because I thought it was cancelled 🥲😞😭
Happy New Year 🎆 Wish you all healthy and wealthy from Thailand 🇹🇭
Happy new year 🥳 everyone
💐💐💐💐🙏🙏🙏🙏💐💐💐💐
Happy New Year 🥳 London ❤️
Love it. It makes me so emotional.
Those drones are amazing!!!!
Love it!💙💕💙💕
Happy new year honey bun 😘🥶❤️
I miss my family members who passed away this year. 😔😔😔😭😭😭💔💔💔
Amazing...Go UK
I'm confused, I thought there wasn't a fireworks display this year. If someone knows if plans changed or something please reply
Oh they have to shove blm down ya throat. ALM??
God bless us all, All the best to all in the new year and forever
3:04 OMG THAT WAS SICKKKKKKKKKK
The best, most inspiring 2021 fireworks display honoring the frontliners. Watching from the Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭 and since we have had earlier welcomed the new year here, I actually said to my brother last night that I wish to see a fireworks display that would honor the frontliners of this pandemic. London literally made it real!
I thought the fireworks were cancelled
I'll be honest, i hoped and thought the BBC would do something secret like this to start off 2021 but i didn't expect anything this big, and I personal think that this years fireworks were better than any other year as it was across a whole city showing some of our landmarks instead of just Westminster. What a way to start 2021 off with a bang! So fair play BBC and the london authorities, thoroughly enjoyed that and has made my year. Happy New Year!!!
SAY IT WITH ME !!!   BLACK LIVES MATTER ✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
Wow!
Booring fireworks
HAPPY NEW YEAR ALL AROUND THE WORLD💕💕
Very nice and betfull  I hope that 2021 will be very good
Beautiful!
Your deluded Attenborough
Happy new year! Love from the u.s
HAPPY new 2021 London
Loved the fireworks but can’t say the same for the commentary. Diversity? New change? After Brexit and the racism I don’t think so. They only mentioned black lives matter because its modern thing to say. This was more like what people want to hear rather than heartfelt messages. Too political.
Happy New year’s from the US
plss forgive me uk
THE DRONES THE DRONES!!!!
Good riddance to 2020 and good riddance to the EU.  Wishing everyone a healthy, happy and prosperous 2021. 🎉🎉🎉💙🥂🥳🥳🥳
This is So Amazing:)
Happy New year, New beginning for Britain x ❤️ hope, love, peace this year xxx
Happy happy new year London .💋💋💋💋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Incredible, what a fantastic emotional start to the year, such a shame BLM politics had to feature.
This is soo emotional we thank god for 2021 and 2020 will be never forgotten and i wish you a very happy new year to everyone
Good riddance 2020, I hope 2021 will bring normality to us all.
It’s all a sham,your all hostages from this evil government
Hello Arriving 2021 Jan 1st, I am here to tell you about the future because we have a lot of thing coming 2021, This is a new year and a great call for celebration with family and dear ones. Start the new year holding on to the old memories with a new spirit and hope. Happy new year! This year may finally realize that real fun in life comes from real people, not from the virtual ones. Have a great year!
Loved the fingers up to the Tories in the use of the colours of the EU and the dove.
HAPPY NEW YEAR LONDON!!!!!!!. 💥🥳💥🥳💥🥳💥🍾🍾🍾👏👏👏 Stay Happy and Healthy!!!!. 💥💫💥💫💥💖💗💖💗
Now that was worth the price of admission!  Well done London!!  Happy New Year everyone!  And good riddance to 2020.
Happy new year 🎉🎉❤️❤️
I shed a tear when David Attenborough started speaking, yall put on an amazing display.
WHAT A TOTAL LOAD OF SHIT ......FFS.
Wishing everybody good health for the New Year 2021 . Take covid seriously people and follow the guidelines for your own safety , for the safety of the  nation ❤️ we will beat this 🥊 So glad they included Sir David Attenborough’s message too . Nice touch .
ਸਾਡੇ ਵਲੋਂ ਬੀ ਬੀ ਸੀ ਦੀ ਸਾਰੀ ਟੀਮਂ ਨੂੰ ਨਵੇਂ ਸਾਲ ਦੀਆਂ ਬਹੁਤ ਬਹੁਤ ਮੁਬਾਰਕ ਜੀ ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ ਜੀ ਦੇ ਚਰਨਾਂ ਵਿਚ ਅਰਦਾਸ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਾਂ ਕਿ ਇਹ ਨਵਾਂ ਸਾਲ 2021 ਸਾਰੇ ਸੰਸਾਰ ਲਈ ਬਹੁਤ ਸਾਰੀਆਂ ਖੂਸ਼ੀਆਂ ਲੈ ਕੇ ਆਏ ਜੀ।

*Bir insan aç ve susuz bir hayvanı beslediği anda, aynı zamanda ruhunu beslemiş olur* *Hayvansever olan değerli arkadaşlar attığım son videoma göz atarsa  sevinirim* *Hoşgeldin 2021* *Mutlu seneler*
Amazing, so completely right for this year. Thank you to all the people who came up with the idea and kept the secret, well done.
BLM what a joke the most racist group and the BBC are actually condoning it , what has happened to This county ?
HAPPY NEW WORLD ORDER EVERYONE 🥂🥳

Best Fireworks ever
as if I cried💀
Happy New Year
Happy New Year England.  Here's wishing that 2021 will definitely be a much better year.  Hugs and love to you all.
UK is out xD
Nero fiddling when Rome burned .. anyone ! .... anyone ! .... oh come on ! Really !!.... bueller .... bueller ............ bueller !!!!
This is the best of the best fireworks then everyone. Is a heart touching.
So much better than every firework before. So emotional 😭❤️
Scrap the BBC, defund it, time for this currupt establishment to go.... Political, pedophiles arse wipes run it,
big ben needs to be new year
WoW United Kingdom this was the best one in the world. Proper emotional heartwarming message to all
I have never been so glad to see the end of a year. I hope that we can all move forward together and make this world a better place before we leave it!
Why I'm I emotional?
Random) 1 Corinthians 6:9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,  1 Thessalonians 5:2  For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.  Revelation 3:3 Remember, then, what you have received and heard. Keep it and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know the hour when I will come upon you.  Revelation 16:15 "Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who remains awake and clothed, so that he will not go naked and let his shame be exposed  Repent And Be Saved. Accept Jesus Now!!! *spread the Gospel and Let others know the Salvation and The Day of Judgement is near.
Hopefully one day I can see the London firework show in real life ❤️ It looks amazing!
سنة  سعيدة إنشاء الله happy new year 👍
The best New year firework ever...
But how many lives could be saved if that money was spent in a different way ?
Imagine having a black nationalist/communist fist raised over your capital city. A truly conquered people. Sad.
New years Eve is no reason to get drunk.....    Unless you want to start the new year with a HAPPY HANGOVER !
Happy New Year 2021!!!!
It is soo emotional, i like emotional news.
Happy new year! I didn’t expect London to make such a beautiful firework display! Let’s try make 2021 better then 2020 which was shit
What an incredible display! The message left us in tears. Hoping for this year to be much better and happy new year :)
Happy New year to everyone xx 🌈💜💙💚💛🧡❤
we still love the pre recorded show
2:57 - right in the feels! I teared up, hugged my two children and held my wife's hand so tight!! 2020 was painful for humanity but humanity showed it's strength against adversity! Proud to be British right now!!
All this celebration is only dedicated to our NHS.🥰❤
Happy New Year! Hope this year we beat this virus and return back to normal.
I love England! Of course they mention flashing lights for the medical issues it poses to some people. Just altogether with the program
You know when your national broadcaster is projecting communist symbols over the sky of London it's time to scrap the license fee.
Lovely
A  happy  new  year♥️。I  hope  UK happy.
Happy new year!! 2021!!
Well, very nice, but at the end of the day and of the year: It's a well made animation film.
Happy new year 2021!
Woah!!! it´s amazing
DEFUND  THE  BBC 🖕
Felt so emotional couldn’t stop my tears.  Grateful that I’m still alive. Please be kind and help each other. Thank you NHS.
Really low in getting intoi to political and progressive program
This one is the most touching new year's welcome. Thank you London! May we all heal now
2021 year will be a greater year !!! we rise!! and shine!! HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE MORE BLESSINGS MORE LOVE
Why does it say "THE NEXT PROGRAM CONTAINS FLASHING IMAGES?" I am not British and don't get this, is this an obligation?
Who else didn’t miss it and just want to see it agein
You think 2020 is bad, wait until it turns ‘21 and starts drinking.
That's made me cry when said we  all will never forget 2020 we lost lots of our loved ones.💔 just hope may God bless on us this year.
Have a better, brighter & blessed Happy New Year 2021 🌈🔆🎊🎉
I like how they literally just blew well Over a million on fireworks and then they talk about the planet and how it’s fragile
The unwieldy cave proximally practise because dragonfly luckily harm mid a ethereal whip. faint fair, milky hourglass
Nice display but terrible BBC tosh narrative. A new year should be about looking forward not looking back to the doom of the past year. These displays are becoming too political now. As soon as they mentioned BAME and BLM, I turned off.
Guys I done my last pee of 2020 :D
I love London❤❤❤💞
What a truly wonderful spectacle. Such a well thought out message. No matter what side of the fence people are on there is no question that coming together is the right thing for all.
2020 year never forget  welcome 2021 and thanks so much NHS
Wow 🤩
Best one yet!
Anyone pls tell what the songs are??
How much did this lot cost ? Money that could have been spent elsewhere .what a farce !!!
It made me cry ,everything was so emotional, what a year it has been. To a happier 2021 good health and prosperity to everyone!
Thank you, London!!!
Absolutely beautiful made me tearup love London xxxx
Wow
The display was so much better without any cuts to people’s reactions in a crowd!
Welcome 2021. Yeeeesaa😢😢
LONDON 🎉✨🎆🎇😍🎉
There was NO fireworks in london  this is BULLSHIT....
2020:An unexpected year that will go down in history forever.       Wishing u an amazing New year filled with joy and hapiness❤
Fantastic - Happy New Year to the world
God bless London! God bless UK! God bless 2021! Cheers🍻
Hope everyone has a POSITIVE happy New Year!!!! 🎆🎆🎆🌅🌅🇺🇸🇬🇧HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021
Speaking as an artist and former professional pyrotechnician: This show as a visual performance-not bad. As an overall production TERRIBLE.  Fireworks are a VISUAL medium. Yes music can be a nice accompaniment, but not dialog.  Very distracting and poorly done.  KEEP POLTICS OUT OF ART!
Happy New Year 2021, England.....!!!!!!!!
I teared up especially with the drone technology with that flying bird and the story of how 2020 has been. Best fireworks display! Happy new year and all the best for the future everyone!
A remembrance of what made the year terrible to be preserved as a warning to future civilizations that may come along. Well done.
That MS Teams cameo has been the story of my life this year...
2020. Soooo last year.
Now that was class.
Happy new year everyone!! 2021.❤️❤️🔥🔥
As soon as Bowie’s Let’s Dance slowed and sounded like someone dragged the needle across the Lp, I knew I was in for something different. It was beautiful and impressive 😭 England ❤️
The drone show was INCREDIBLE.
Noo way my dad lives there brooo
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE.. LET'S JUST KEEP LOVING LAUGHING AND BEST OF ALL LIVING..
The end of a decade , best decade ever, the moments I have cherished on my camcorder from 2010-2011 made me cry , the 8 GB memory card that is worth more than money to me
Sir David’s voice at the end was the thing  I most wanted!!
Happy New Year !
Happy New Year UK and all around the world... hope 2021 keeps you healthy and safe...united we stand divided we fall, so we all need to play our part in keeping each other safe ...best wishes... Jill UK...
I was expecting a let down and this blew me away. They have done us proud again. Happy new year all. Xxx
Half the world in 2021 and the other half in 2020!!!🎊🎉
2020 a year we cannot forget..
Yes I praise the nhs ,but I think most of us deserve that praise also ~here is to a better 2021
Great fireworks and lasers but I could have done without the preachiness.
I think we can all agree that this was the BEST New Years display London has ever done! So beautiful, emotional and heartwarming! Proof that the UK will ALWAYS have 'hope'
M A G N I F I Q U E ... !! 🤝🍷👍😷🦠
Happy New Year from your friends across the pond in Florida USA
Love this. Happy New Year from Indonesia 🎉
Wow that was absolutely fantastic
They should do this laser thing every year
Whats that song at 3:26
Happy birthday jesus🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️
One of the best shows in the world
All the police seating there's no fireworks to see then they go ahead and do it
I was watching this on TV and i cried when the countdown started
Wonder how many DJI drones were used in that display?
🥂✨🎉🎂  Kudos to those at home, busting open beers still celebrating on their own...
Beautiful, Happy New Year from Costa Rica..
Why was Alicia Keys hosting LONDONS NYE? Also why did she sing ‘Empire State of Mind’ right after it turned 2021. Makes no sense lol
Happy New Year, thank you so much for sharing the message around the world. Brilliant! Well done.
FAKE FIREWORK DISPLAY
Let’s hope this year is better than the last!
Shame it was pre recorded and that the fireworks were used from previous displays to be honest. No mention to the new world we embark into out of the EU. Shame after this year that it couldnt have been what it should have been,  Spectacular and unifying. Just dissapointing in the end.
Thank you London.That's brilliant! 🌈❤️

Clasical fireworks was better. Maybe next year. Was that BLM propaganda necessary??
With all the challenges of 2020 and the amazing acts of love and kindness, this is what holds us all together. I’m proud to be British, love and peace to you all for 2021 ✌️ ❤️
first year to coundown with tear😢 amazing show.
I didn't realise they were drones! That was amazing I was so confused if it wasn't just something on the screen and not in real life
Puke making.
I Love London is amazing year
One of the best displays for years from London, love how they have used muliple locations, I hope they keep this set up for 2022, much better than just simply showing the london eye.  Happy new year one and all, heres hoping 2021 is a better year for us all.
The concluding part really resurrected the humanity in me
That was epic! Loved every bit of it! ❤️
David Attenborough, that got me
Absolutely awesome. Well done London. Amazing!
2021 the year of hope
Brillian,  apart from the old turd with the zimmer.
This was definitely the best they've ever done
Treasure!!!
This was so emotional 2020 was such a hard year i hope everyone is safe out there :{
Are the fireworks real or are they lasers
happy new year guys :D
👎You sons of Satan in government have the audacity to  celebrate a new year after you deceived the whole country into lock downs using ur corona hoax etc.. May God reserve for you e il elites the hottest part of hell & more!
Awesome! Marvellous! This is our UK! So emotional!
Happy new year London! From Australia 🇦🇺
One of the best fireworks display ever. Kudos to the team who came up with such a thoughtful idea 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
London never fails to impress
Greetings from Spain
When will the government stop the lies.. they first tell us new year fireworks are cancelled and now look!    They went and gave us the best fireworks display of the past decade!

I proud to be Londoner 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓

Happy new year
Spectacular
happy new years england we still have a way to go here in the west coast of the united states
Meanwhile!!!! 🤪 On the streets in the UK people are protesting!! Freedom of speech removed!! The expense of the sky display?? Trafalgar Square has been boards off so locals can't enjoy their traditional new year! 😥
Emotionally watching this. 2020 is the year that we will never forget.
HAPPY NEW YEAR . LONDON . from  JOSEPH  ,IN USA .
the black lives matter one.
Happy New Year from Connecticut USA. Loved this! Hope this is done every year!  Peace and love everyone!
Passivity got a bruise...... there will be light from the darkness and the narrow vision will see its demise!
No emotion. No tears. No smiles. Just yawns. DREADFUL!!!!
Wow !! That is pretty marvelous and brilliant fireworks including the Drones and Happy New Year 2021 to everyone indeed 🎉😃
This was incredible! Favourite New year show
Blm ew
Did not expect that it was spot on for me! Amazing..
Happy 2021
Happy new Year everyone let's hope is a better one
Peace, happiness and prosperity to all reading this!
Happy New year everyone God bless you all let's hope 2021 is a better year full of happiness and joy
totally dissapointed.
Hope together and love together Everyone Happy new year to whole Nation's God bless all of us.
Cringey woke bollocks. Worst bbc firework display ever
So amazing :)
They mentioned black lives matter but forgotten Sikh lives matter they didn't not mention farmers in India which isn't fair and nice
All lives matter not just black and not just white all live matter
Hope the drones make a return next year :)
When I saw those lil messages I really started crying ....Happy New Yearrrr
I enjoyed this better than the usual display , I preferred all the landmarks to be featured, incredible thought went into this. Thank you so much
Happy new year to everybody
Happy New Year me and you
Watching this in the US where the government does jack sh*t for healthcare. "The Nightingale hospital was constructed just in 9 days, it was blue, the color of the NHS"  Me: Well sh*t, that hurt
Happy New Year
KEYED
I love Big Ban
As a Londoner. Im proud of my city. This never failes to impress. Whoever did the dove are G.O.A.T.S
That was bloody amazing! So much better than the usual boring fireworks display!
I wasn't expecting this and it was great, thank you
Why does everyone have to put that misguided BLM message everywhere?
I love London ❤️
Happy new year 🥳🎆🎉🎊
Happy New year London
Happy newyear everone
Absolutely brilliant 👏 Made me cry...the people who put this together should be very proud of themselves, because it sums up 2020 and touches the heart ❤
Loving this display with great reminder of our best moments
Youtube rewind 2020 on London lol
Will go down as one of the most memorable due to events of covid. Drones are amazing. wow
Beautiful display. Happy new year everyone! 🥳
big up david attenbrough
I am happy to be in London , even though we are staying in. 😁
Alright but imagine the that was able to say the "Thank you NHS heroes" could say they said one of the most crucial lines in maybe one of the most memorable firework shows in history.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Happy new year everyone wish u all the best
Bye 2020👋
I thought we were getting invaded ngl
Track name at 2:45 ??
Happy new year 2021 to everyone 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧
Was this whole show pre recorded???
"this programme contains flashing images" really??? never would've thought that about fireworks lol (it was a joke ik they have to do it) also this had me crying. and it took me way too long to figure out that they were drones. anyways happy new year.
The year we beat Covid 19.  Or we get Covid 20?
They need to do a display like this all over the city every year, I prefer it to the usual ones at the London Eye. It really shows off what an amazing and diverse city London is
Whoever choreographed this deserves a raise. The drone technology & message is incredible !: )
England to win Euro 2021? 😁
They had to include the Marxist regime blm 😝
I still think that millennium dome was a waste of money
...the best fireworks London has put on, and the best display this year! Loved it!
This was Beautiful! 2020 summarised in one emotional video. I wish you all my fellow brothers and sisters a Happy New Year!! May this year bring you success, happiness and joy. Love You All!! Here's to 2021!!!! :)
BLM Marxist
Please give us our life back 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
At least London had fireworks this year! Let's pray and hope for a great 2021. But the drones are so beautiful!
The siren at the end. Typical
What’s that Bob Marley song called?
hyjacked garb

BEAUTIFUL! HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!! MAY 2021 BE A BLESSING TO US ALL!
Nice to see other London Landmarks being used for a change in the New Year celebrations. Fantastic display and a lovely way to end this awful year.
oh damnnn
Happy new year everyone...Thank you NHS and the all involved who helping  to many. Xx
❤️❤️❤️❤️Happy New Year 2021 xx
Happy new year everyone!!! 2021!
I’ve never cried this much for fire works, but this year has been a mix of emotions so let’s hope THIS year will pull us through i hop everyone has an amazing year good luck 🥳😭 omg thank you guys so much for the likes x
Simply the best, so so moving bitter sweet, puts things into perspective, hopefully a change from narcissism and self destructiveness to community caring shown by our selfless nhs team and giving souls
Just fireworks please. Leave out the political commentary
I love the blm part!!!!
Incredible! I think its the best fire work display so far dont dissapoint us America's!
Very proud to see the fist. All our hard work symbolised and recognised ✊🏼
Amazing. The light drones are superb and should be used ever year now on.  Very memorable. what a year
It could have been more inspiring that worshipping a failing health service and a bunch of people ignoring social distancing guidelines to protest.
That is wonderful!
Happy New Year To All Lets hope its a better year the the one we have just had
How many drones were used for this,anyone?This was unique and amazing.🔥🔥
2020 Sad year, we not for get  2020,
Increíble 👌🎇🎇🎇
The amount of times I have heard black lives matter is too much. When will I hear white lives matter- we matter too!
Happy new year wishing this year to be great to everyone 2021 here we go 🎊🤩🤩
I got one word for you: WOW
Here's to Covid-20
Best yet well done
Hopefully 2021 will be a good year? Well time will only tell i guess
This is a joke 2021 is gunna be 2020 all over again 😂
Goodbye to all that have lost along the way- together we can keep pushing into a better year.
Let's hope for a fantastic 2021 😀👍🎉🎊💕
yo I love that they included sir David Attenborough that was very fitting for this year
HAPPY NEW YEAR
This is so weird, London is usually packed but this year no one was there 😕😭😭
This was awesome! Thank you.
Thank you guys! That was sooo nicee
I Love It BBC  Radio ,Happy New Year!!!!
Happy New Year Everyone. Almost teared up listening to Captain Tom Moore saying thank you
“Make it a happy new year for ALL THE INHABITANTS of planet earth” AKA among other things; stop destroying animals and eco-systems with the demand of eating them.
BLM racist propaganda, poor UK. Support for the Britain's people from France.
Happy new year to all ........
Wow the fireworks display is beautiful  The message is empowering and  thoughtful  Let's love each other and respect each other's difference
One of the most meaningful fireworks. Thanks to UK government and thanks to the NHS 🙏🙏🙏
This is amazing , hopefully 2021 is better , happy new year everyone 🤍
This was the best London new year evening ever!! Just amazing! 👏🏻 So proud of my city 🇬🇧
Happy New Years to the UK! 4 hours left on the east coast! Can’t wait!!
Glad to see I’m not the only one that teared up
ndl
Happy New Year at all of you ! be kind and happy live free🙏🏻🥂✌🏻
Incredible miles better than the fireworks around the london eye ❤️
Wishing you a very happy and healthy New Year for 2021! 🎉
I hate that covid19 your still here I wish you had remained in 2020 unfortunately your here. Hope for the best as the new year begins. Happy New Year everyone
Brilliant start to the new year . Mentioning blm and hopefully their social demands are met this year. Emotional
I switched to ITV for the fireworks and all I saw was the Big Ben gongs but it turns out London did have a fireworks display after all! Thanks BBC and Sadiq Khan for making this happen 🎆💖🌟
I cried a lot when I watched this London New Year's Eve Fireworks, even it didn't held at the London Eye.  This made me impressed, especially to the drone who shown things happened last 2020.  HAPPY NEW YEAR LONDON! 💙🤍❤ From: Philippines 🤗
My  God....I   got  tearful, while watching it
Sorry but all lives matter............👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
No offence I work in a freezer all day what makes us retailers workers different to NHS workers am I a dickh*ad
Happy new year everyone 😍🥰🥰🥰
Judging how vibrant the restored clock face is, the Elizabeth Tower should look amazing once all of the work has been completed.
Absolute cringe.
I loved the Black Lives Matter display, especially considering all the technology used to create the display did not in the slightest rely on any actual technology invented by Black people. The hilarious irony.
TOMFOOLERY!
"let's make 2021 even worse than 2020" George cut the display cost
In today's uncertain times, where everything is falling apart, the Stellar Cryptocurrency is the best investment in which investors can still make big profits.   Don't miss your chance to become a billionaire and invest in Stellar Cryptocurrency!  Bitcoin = Shitcoin, Stellar = Realcoin!
Happy new Year everyone! Let’s all do our best to cheer up 2020!
Well done and congratulations to all the organisers of the fireworks this year! This is far the most beautiful in the past decade! Super love that they included the Shard, Tower Bridge and The 02! The drones, Wow! Thank you, NHS! 💙🇬🇧💙
UTTERLY SHAMELESS PROPAGANDA AT ITS VERY WORST.....DISGUSTING !!
That was cool, but the Fireworks on the London Eye are way better!
OMG it is gorgeous!!!! Happy New Year everyone. Stay Safe! . . . . However, it should be ''ALL'' Lives Matter. Thank you.
Happy New Years..
Happy New Years..
unhappy new year 2021
Why couldn't I find this when it was live?
I love that it’s slightly different this year and we get to see the O2, Tower Bridge, the shard, Westminster Bridge and Drones involved! They need to incorporate more of this into the regular show! Especially love the waterfall off Tower Bridge and the drones!
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021
That was beautiful. Captured so much.. Smiled at the you're on mute.. We all have had that...i really have a lot of hope for this year.. Without hope we have nothing.... Happy New Year...
Good riddance 2020. Let's hope 2021 brings us much more joy.
People read ayatul Kursi rather than saying happy new year anyone agree with me 👇🏻
Look at us smashing the displays💪🏻😝
Keep the light show for years to come please brilliant well done.
stay safe!
Happy New Year!!!! Let's make it a happy healthy year!
Love it
2020 was hell-
Stay strong, fight for our freedom.💪 Covid, WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER!
All that money wasted that could have gone to the NHS that 99% of the population are taking a shite on..  We deserve to be killed off.. Well done 😡
Spyro 2 music at the end, from autumn plains. Anyone notice?
shoot I shouldve watched this before. man I wish I can go to London to actually experience looking at the fireworks but gotta wait until next year and I think that will never happen
2021 Yay 😊👍💕🎉🎊
This is the most incredible light show i've ever seen on London in the first time!
Nobody wants to hear about the hoax virus during the fireworks. Totally ruined the show 😒
We out did the world with this display. 2021, Let's go! Gather the rainbow!
I’m so emotional rn
Where are all the stars?
A communist organisation that has achieved nothing but spread more division, murder, millions of USD worth of damage, unnecessary violence and set race relationships back decades worth of progress because of a career criminal who pointed a loaded gun at a pregnant woman & ultimately died of a fentanyl overdose 3000+ miles away being the main point of celebration from the BBC tells you absolutely everything you need to know about what to expect in 2021... good grief when will the majority of this beautiful country wake up and do something about this madness?
2020 has been an awful year. Too much fighting and arguing and not enough love and compassion for others. We need to come together and support one another and not fight anymore. We need to be better and make this world a fair and better place for everyone. BLM ❤️  Happy New Year 🥳
I whach dis on my tv and HAPPY NEW YEAR AND GET 2020 OUT OF HERE
Cringe as hell, but Miss Keys killed it 👌🏼
Woow, what a great job!! bravo to the people whom came up with the idea and nailed it. Brilliant work 👍😄
I think this year firework was LITTT! This time the whole of London could see fireworks, light shows and were cheering! I live in Wapping so I could see the Shard flashing and changing the colour in the sky and I saw fireworks from the Tower Bridge. I think for 2022 London should also do fireworks on the Shard as well as the London Eye
waste of money
I can't be the only one sat there in tears
Tom moor is amazing I saw it and cried
It was going OK until the blm tribute.  BBC backing left wing Marxist thugs. Ergh  Defund the BBC
Watching the awesome replay, great job UK
Sir David’s Attenborough for the finale! 💛💛💛 Happy new year UK!!!
Happy New Year 2021 England. Greetings from California may this year be a year of healing. Light love and peace
Like
Incredible performance to say goodbye to 2020 and a hello to 2021. We all have been through a rough, difficult time throughout 2020. But, it also brought families together, stick together and be there for each other. It’ll also prepare England for other difficult challenges other than Covid-19. However, I hope the New year brings goodness, hope and joy into each and everyone of your lives. Happy new year!
Happy new year everyone keep ur heads up with this corona stay strong keep ur loved ones close
handcock.... lie
wow beautifully done !  love your message, your light show and the hope for 2021  - Happy New year !!
God I hate that  organisation.
I missed this when it was shown on TV so glad I can see it now. Oh my feel so emotional especially when Captain Tom come on 😪♥️. Happy New Year x
I will say it as the firework show didn't. Thank you to all the key workers who put there health at risk day in and day out, the mechanics who kept everyone on the roads to get to work to save lives and keep the UK flowing, retail staff working in supermarkets and shops for there continous effort and being there for everyone who needs there essential supplies and to every other key worker. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE AMAZING EFFORT IN 2020 AND LETS HOPE 2021 WILL BRING US ALL JOY AND HAPPINESS
Happy new year to all.
Scamdemic 2020
*We will make 2021 better! We can do this!*
Happy New Year
Every year London New year Fireworks are a work of art. This year wasn’t any different. Bravo to the team who made it happen. 👏
This one was better than last years!
people get the best care by the NHS;)
Happy new year!!!
I love this. Wish i could've been there, but this is the next best thing. Happy new years everyone and let's hope for it to bring some miracles which make 2021 a truly amazing year again. Cheers❤
Sitting here crying my eyes out.  Did you see the Dubai light show?  Wow!!
What an embarrassment...!!    London couldn't resist promoting Marxist race-baiters blm could they...?   No wonder British people have to tell foriegn friends "London is NOT the UK!"   Dreadful rubbish.  Sadiq khan's dismal dump of a city.
BeautifulJOB!!
Song name is leave a light on  2:59
Мне одной кажется, что политики просто ржут над нами.  В конце черепашка, и слоган, что 2021 время возможностей изменить мир. Никто ничего не собирается возвращать так, как было. Салют красивый. С Новым годом!!
Let's hope for a better and new year! Love from Devon
Wot the hell you fools doing fireworks for ?
Such a load of left-wing progressive bullshit. Here's hoping the BBC will be defunded in 2021.
Happy And Healthy 2021
Thx for this magical Moment! I hope y'all have a great and safe start in 2021 !
Is this London, okay it's so beautiful ❤
Happy New Year everybody!
How /Can/ We /Hel /the /NHS /more ??  /THANK /[YOU!!
Happiest New Year....Love & Light.. !!!
Why do they have to put a Communist fist up there though? :(
Hoping for a new beginning, a happy and prosperous 2021 May we all stay happy and healthy ameen
❤️❤️❤️❤️
london never fails to impress me. this one is emotional. never thought i’d start tearing up watching fireworks display i love it so much!!
Happy Safe New Year to all NHS staff. Thanks BBC for the recognition. Love to you Gemma Amy and Dan who are working in the hospitals in the front line I'm proud of you. ❤🌈
Do any of you sheep know what the black fist symbolises? Would you be equally comfortable if the BBC had included swastikas in their 'celebrations'? Wake up ffs
سلام مهدی من سارام، امیدوارم طبق روال هر ساله ات بیای ببینی لندن رو،  سال نوت مبارک، به تویینکل و اریک ورمزی سلام برسون، همتونو دوز دارم شدیییید. بوچ بوچ
The Nightingale was beautiful, shame the hospital has since closed. Nice sentiment though
Happy New Year London
Best display ive ever seen
Happy New Year to you all, wishing you all a successful and healthy year ahead :) x
Happy new year everyone!!!
That was just brilliant!
Farewell 1984. Hello 1984
Happy New Year 2020 and Feliz Año Nuevo 2021
ANYONE ELSE CRYING RN😭❤️❤️
Only 18000 views because most people(like me) were watching fake live stream on youtube 😖
Good to see a woman with a natural figure
I thought they got cancelled haha
Well it was a good show, a bit different to the usual London eye fireworks and it was nice to have a change. It just shows they can put more fireworks across the Thames like Sydney harbour bridge instead of just the same every year. The drones added something and should be used again more creatively.
Happieeee new year folks😇😇
David Attenborough smashed it New Year New Me
ALL LIVES MATTER!
Is this cg plus old firework footage. I thought the fireworks were cancelled?
Didn't mention about Brexit deal but mentioned BLM and Climate Change
Happy new fear
So nothing about the historic moment that had happened an hour before this
Happy New Year 💛 🇬🇧🎉 Greetings from Philippines
This new year seems crap it seems like a ghost town nobody celebrated it just goes to show this new year is dead
Happy New Year everyone loved the NHS, bird and Capt Tom  light show.
Drones
What track is at 2.48 seconds?
Happy New year 💥💥💥💥💥💥💙💚💜💕
Hello from Singapore! Happy New year 2021
This made me cry inside. Especially that inspirational message from sir david attenborough
Wow that was amazing. Better than any firework display in the previous years. If we can get through 2020 then we can get through 2021 together. If anyone can do this, we all can!! May 2021 bring on better days for us all and bring us all closer together but not too close because of social distancing HA stay safe guys and HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!! 🎉🎉🍾🍾🎆🎇✨🎉🎉
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVRYONE HOPE U HAVE A BETTER YEAR WISH U LUCK!!!
Happy new year! Brilliant display
Absolutely brilliant 👏
Happy new year hopefully we will have a better year than 2020
its been sooooo long 2020s finaly  gone happy new year everyone hope 2021 will be better than this awful year 🎉 😊✨
Happy new year guy’s have a great year
That got me emotional ngl
What a beautiful display - I loved the animations with the drones. More of these in future please!
How poignant and beautiful at the same time. We love you uk 🇬🇧 .
Amazing.
Love you guys in the UK so much. Stay safe, stay Strong. Happy New Year. From Indiana, USA. 💗🥂🍾💗
Happy New Year!
Actually happy about a firework display thought they weren't going to show them but thank goodness they did happy new year let's hope things get back to normal this year
God bless the United Kingdom. This is the best. Lots of love. Happy New Year to everyone. Amazing display.
Anyone know where this was filmed
Why can i see a boss meter
This was better than the usual display round the London eye!
Happy New year 😊🎉🎊💕👍
🤗🤗🤗Happy new year.🎊🎉🎈
Incredible, emotional and almost indescribable as it is so incredibly inspiring after such a sad, emotional, traumatic and unforgettable 2020!
2021 is our year ❤
Tomorrow the pre planned propaganda campaign to keep us locked down till Easter, will begin.  Probably be blamed on how we was all naughty Boy's and Girls on Christmas Day, or possibly a convenient, new 3rd strain, of covid 1984
Wishing everyone a Happy New Year, and a winning 2021 full of positive energy, blessings, happiness, and good health. As up and down as 2020 has been, it's taught us never to take anything for granted
All a farce, there were no fireworks in London at all, Liars to the core, typical for the BBC!!!
First New Years I’ve cried, best display I’ve seen. Well done♥️
Hello everyone,  I wish all reading this a very happy New Year, I hope you all will have a pleasant and peaceful year ahead of you.  2020 was rough, so much happened that it tested our resolve. It tried to break our spirits, but we held on! Let us raise a glass to 2021 and raise another for those who won't be joining us this year.  United we stand, divided we fall. Happy New Year everyone!
This is beyond initiative! The message speaks itself and may this year 2021 brings us hope. Together we can get through this. Happy New Year!😘
Was beautiful until the racist marxist dross BLM was mentioned - the scum who spread the virus while they were trashing our heritage.
Funny you hear the siren right at the end
In 2021 can we just stop pretending and starting killing whitey
HAPPY NEW YEAR 🥳
Amazing as always...🥳🥳😍😍😍
Good riddance to 2020
Ohh look at the pity party in the sky to remind us of the previous year
happy new year, fellow brits!
2020 the year of togetherness while being apart.
Happy New Years everyone 💖💖2021
Happy new year xx
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE!!!!
I barely recall seeing a white singer on the Hootenanny,  these fackers need defunding
Stay safe
That drone display above the o2...I was not expecting that! Happy new year everyone...So glad to be leaving 2020 in the past.
HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE 😘❤❤❤❤
of course blm ruined it
Happy New Year god bless everyone 🙏🏻🙏🏻🇨🇦
happy new year 2021 all
De Chelonian Mobile!
Crying our way into 2021, only right way. Happy New Years to all and bring on the hopefully brighter year!

Happy new year lets hope this is the year of healing : family: love : peace 🕊💚⚕️

5:07 sounded like the thing in teams meetings.
what a load of sentimental slush. God help this woke infantile country
I hope it will be a good year!
pretty awesome
Hope you all have a great 2021
Happy new year guys
the hearts look like penises 😭
Happy New and safe year to All of our 🤗🎉🎊🙏🎂
Happy new year xx
Even though we had to be apart, even just being on the phone with my dad and watching this made me so happy. I'm so glad they kept the standards high despite everything.
hope everyone has a great year. stay safe everyone. :) big up NDL tho ;)
Happy New Year from Florida. Wishes to all for a better new year!  😀

Step closer to my cyber truck.
A real happy new year for you Guys !
Happy new year
Happy new Year everyone
How did you do that. Such strong lightning and fireworks and drones wow. Thankyou london. Happy New year 2021
Hopefully London keeps something like that next year
Happy New Year!
So many people said there won’t be a firework show...
We’re the lights drones on the sky that made all of the words and stuff
I'll miss 2020
Happy New Year assuming the psychopaths who run things will allow it. I don’t think so!?!
Amazing! Xx
Nice that Covid is gonna go now according to some people
Happy New Year! 🥳💕!
Who else bawled their eyes out whilst singing along whilst grinning like crazy because 2021 the year of hope is here and we have ALL got through this crazy year and there’s finally light at the end of the tunnel- we are all so amazing and strong so proud! xxx
They did an absolutely brilliant job. I was in tears!!
5:55, they actually showed respect to  the violent racist BLM
I like the light show at the start with the shard. But i just felt like the London Eye was all alone and could’ve had more of the show tonight. Wembley stadium was amazing and Tower Bridge. Decent display.
2021 is for Everone make it yours ❤️
Whats all those fists about? no more division in 2021 please!  This is being shown around the world. I'm ashamed!!!
Happy New Year!! Everyone! May God bless UK and the whole world 🌎🌎🌍 with cure and healthy.
HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021 🥳🥳🥳
Of nice good coll
Incredible one of the best displays in years
Best EVER!!!!
....
Hope I don’t have to come back 6 months later
Happy New YEARRRRR YAYY
Amazing! Beautiful! I love it. All, Join Together, Hope Together and Love Together❤❤❤. Humankind UNITED! Be kind, peaceful to one another. I love you UK respect to my country !!!!!
Another year over. Let's hope 2021 will be a year of healing rather than death.
HAPPY NEW YEAR! <3
Wow, so impressive 👏 Happy new year!
Let’s hope this year is gonna be a better one. Happy new year all. Watching this display was emotional good luck in the future everyone and I hope the best for you all 👍
