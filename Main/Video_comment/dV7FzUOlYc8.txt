I love when Pearls just like; Oh he's angy
I totally hear a persona 5 track being used as background music around 11:20
If you put a pearl head on a noteblock will it say goodye mate
To mule or, not to mule. 😂
"dear diarrhea" is hilarious
“That’s a new one”
the warden head would be awesome as a boat motor
I love how Grian keeps getting featured, but never talks
21:22 Keralis says @$$
"Oop he's talking to the ocean." Grian is giving Moana vibes.😂 (yes, I'm late, I'm new to the channel, I've known you but, new, I wanted to see your perspective and honestly, I love the way you do your videos. Keep it up we love you pearl ❤)
bye the second u said the flash my cat did a half flip while bolting to my computer
"There's a hole in here, its pretty good" ~Pearlescentmoon 2024
They way she reads keralis is insane 😂😂
In the background of Episode 2, I'm pretty sure I heard the music from Piemations' Bill Cipher Orders A Pizza. Weird coinkydink!
Typical Aussie talking about how much better a ute is because you can carry stuff.
Pearl, this my first season of Hermit Craft and I adore so many of the group but for some reason you and Gem are the two I just keep rewatching your episodes. It’s just so comforting to have on while I’m working.
I am a new subscriber and I just wanna say I love how sweet and soothing these videos are. Your work is amazing Pear! 🎉
Is it me or does the warden head sound like a helicopter when played repeatedly
Keralis: If u had a horse u would have made that. Minutes later... Pearl: If u had a mule u would have made that. XDDDDDDDDDD
❤
My throat inconveniently decided to be swollen at the moment Keralis was impaled after the piglin smacked him. I almost literally died of laughter 😂
*”ALWAYS WATCHING…”*
Gem being so upset in chat over keralis dying so much XD
bro said a##
I always hit the deep dark
This was a really great episode!
pearl and keralis is an unexpected duo but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense
"not diarrhea... it's a log"  xb cracks me up (and cracks himself up, which I also appreciate)
😂
15:23, in tears to pearl's reaction
the ancient sea raid
17:35 Did they just harmonize their sighs!? XD
Pearl and Keralis are SUCH a great duo, they’re so funny
Don’t forget to get your pickaxe back lol
“to my diarrhoea”
Nice program
How does Grian just know?
12:00 3 enchanted golden apples in 1 chest?!
💗💜💗
Can never get enough of Purl and Keralis interactions
I ❤  this one please
Awesome
You think Minecraft would be better or worse if they put a parry in?
grian silently and immediately coming over to repeatedly click the warden note block is so fantastic
😮
Pearl is so done with people messing with her trapdoors that she now joined the trapdoor bullying... lol
that part in the deep dark has given me an idea for a mini game someone could make. A free for all in an arena with a whole bunch of wardens and your goal is to be the last one standing or to try and find something in a chest somewhere on the map, everyone has snowballs they could use to direct the warden over to people. you cant kill anyone but you can punch them off of ledges. dunno how good it would be as i dont understand ALL the mecanics of the warden.
Hey does anyone know whos the guy at the top of the tower at 14:05 ?
The warden head would go perfectly with gems base because it is water themed and it could be an engine
grian "talking to the ocean" at 4:20 looked like he was drowning himself xD
Oi? Did you go french on us at 2:58 ? "Je crois qu'il y ..."
This episode made me laugh so man times!😂 Pearl you are my favorite Hermit ❤
Totally can’t tell Pearl is the youngest on the server…nope…totally can’t.
10:32 16:52 21:18 27:52 30:18 31:38
*facepalm*  Over the hill and through the woods  To Pearlo’s house we go…
Your voice is gorgeous!
Is this true in mythical sausages video he said you are his girlfriend
When you go red, Put ignited tnt above the overworld end portal. When someone goes in they die
subtitles say " pesent moon" 😅😂😂
Keralis dying again and again on Iskall's stream was so funny and confusing 😂
I love that Pearl will never be scared of Wardens again after dominating Decked Out 2.
👍
*Mac N Cheese noises*
I always enjoy your vids pearl...u edit skills are really good and ur funny..im always laughing not stop...ty
I love how Grian has just straight up become a fishing cult leader. His little "The ocean provides" just tells you how insane he's gone trying to fish up that mending book. XD
great video
12
12
I love the vibe you and Keralis got together sooo much. It's so heartwarming to see you two together. Even if you are doing evil things :D
4:00 My stomach after eating too much Taco Bell.
When played continuously, the warden noteblock sounds like an engine.
We love you pearl 💛💛💛
Fun!
Pearls lack of fear for wardens is only paralleled by Tango. I wonder why that could be…. :)
8:00 That clip is something else 🤣
yay!! the crafting station looks great :D
Lol I'm loving how while Keralis and Pearl are trapping the portal, Iskall is (unsuccessfully) forbidding Cleo from being an accomplice to murder in the chat.
Hanging out with keralis was hilarious! 😆
Nice video
Thank you for the wonderful episode Pearl!
I didn't know that the warden was the start up sound for the PSone
I love Pearl and Keralis collabs!
Great episode, Pearl!
I'm getting full Double Life Tango vibes at 2:45 😂
Pearl over here killing a warden like it's nothing
xB has such a pleasant voice.
🎉 😄 👍 👌 .
Hi pearl, this is totally random but I'm writing a book and I'm wondering if I have your permission to use your name in it (Pearlecentmoon) I writing a fantasy novel thats kina ment to played out in minecraft and I was just wondering if I am allowed to use your name in it.
3 gapples is crazy!!
loved the episode. ive been wondering how those traps came aboutt
This was delighful. Thanks so much!
Name the mule chocolate and the donkey milk
Awesome episode.
Enjoyed the episode!
it seems like everyone in hermitcraft is doing the same thing right now.    FISH
I saw some of this on stream!!! This is giving me flashbacks! lol
Season 10: We got some of the new stuff that's going to be released in the next update.  Every Hermit: fishing rods go!
grian and gem have gone insane...
Why is Pearl speaking french at  2:57 ? "ah je crois qu'il ...." help me !
3 notch apples in one chest is insane 12:00
Pearl was so busy organizing all week that she forgot drip stone can be used for lava farms lmao😂
The warden head could be use for a plane engine sound
Using the Wardens head as the “doorbell” when someone enters her house is very cool! Also I think Joehill is going to be scared of fishing rods now because of Pearl 😆
The banter between Etho and Scar during the minigames is pure comedy gold!
Can we talk about how incredible the Hermitcraft community is? The way everyone supports and encourages each other, even in hilarious moments like these, is truly heartwarming. It's no wonder this server has such a dedicated and passionate following.
Did everyone just forget the voice chat activates the sound in game
So lovely Pearl!
spamming the warden sounds like a helicopter taking off xD
Hermitcraft: “You need a bow to kill a Warden!” Double Life: **Fishing Rods.**
All the hermit interactions are the best!
Please give a tutorial video of building
Please give a tutorial video of bulid
Pearl's intro always calms me so much 💚 It's always like yes hello Pearl, I'm so ready to have a good time today 😊
Poor forgotten bundles.  Really could of helped carry more items.
In my Opearlion best episode so far 😊
You need to fish a mending book before grian does.
Hi Pearl! I just want to say I love you and your videos so much. Your vibrant personality just brings me joy! Have a great day❤️
How dose grain know what your saying from so far away like the parot and the bow how dose he know is it the power of the ocean or what
Very funny
they should have used like quartz or something to make a path, so that seeing white on the floor isnt as suspitious
I don't like Jevin's style in caving. A bit cheaty with the brightness. He was this annoying too in the caving expedition with Etho at the start of the season.
I love this Collab so much.
Aussie Aussie Aussie!!!
Extra Nice  🤎♥️💚
3 notch apples is soo lucky
Loving how social this season has been for everyone so far
4:47 I thought it was pearls voice and I got jumpscared😂
imagine if foolish games the totem shark form dsmp join hermticraft
Keralis talking about how a let down the mules are bc they have a chest on each side of their flanks but has little storage space Keralis : “That’s a let- that’s a let down I guess” Pearl : “Well you’re a you’re a let down but I don’t talk about that”  We love a mean Pearl XD
I'm so sad I actually already saw some stuff from other hermits, but, not just pearl, but having EVERYONE hanging around this much with anyone else, besides like, doing 30-50 hours builds from day to night, is going amazing. It feels like, it takes you hermits back to what minecraft is much for everyone else who plays, a happy fun time with our friends, and that's make me so happy.  ps: I love you content and they way you do it pearl, I know you are hearing and reading so many bad things recently, but they are just meaningless. Keep on, our cleaning lady, and my favorite hermit!
23:52 I love pearls chaotic energy
loved this episode c: the chaos is amazing and exactly what i needed today
18:21 Swede meets Aussie.  As a fellow Aussie, I approve.
Joe's deadpan nature is perfect for Demise.
PearlescentMoon the Warden Hunter You are a beautiful, smart, and funny woman. Your quirky nature always makes me laugh. Stay the way you are and don't let any f****** a******* unsettle you!
"Always watching..." sounded a lot different when you said it to Joe than when you used to say it to BigB.
Gem should get that warden head, it sounds like an idling engine!
My original thought to upgrading your trap was to add pure white map tiles in a box around the portal to add more confusion, but literally while writing this I had another idea: Nertherrack Map tiles to blend it in >:)
Its funny how mumbos 1 episode arleady had pearl with a warden head
put your mule right her- I DONT HAVE A LEAD
"I've got a mule and her name is Sal" 15 miles on the Erie Canal
Pearl should her red skin while being a reaper!
Since you have a surplus of Gapples, you can make a Thing banner. M8ght be a cool way to decorate.
That Roz impression was hilarious!   Pearl and Keralis’ interactions are so wholesome, even with the savage insult and setting death traps. 😊
doc was the victim of portal in spawn HAHAAHAH
Joe is a great heckler apparently
The warden sounds like a soundtrack for dune.
I was so confused when I started watching the video cause it seemed like I already watched it then realized it’s cause I watched the live stream
loved the episode!! Something that's a coincidence is that I dreamt about Hermitcraft XD and today you posted an episode!
This video gave me all the serotonin I need. Loved the interaction between you and Joe 😂
the whole convo of Cleo and Iskall in chat was incredibly hilarious. 28:50
"You being alive is not exciting enough apparently."  -Most threatening thing ever said on Hermitcraft.
I have to agree that carrying items is often better than speed in Minecraft.
umm pearl... not sure if you realized this, but three notch apples in one ancient city chest is EXTREMELY RARE
keralis is a cinnamon roll
I had no idea putting wool around a chest stopped them from making sound. i knew putting it around shriekers stops them from going off but this is why i am never able to loot them.   lovely information learnt from your video as always pearl
I wonder if the different wither heads sound different on the note blocks?
he if you  ever end up  on thje inpuls pod cast ples  invert your screen to play in to be upside down in aus hahaha
not "dear diarrhea" LOL 21:17 KERALIS
Pearl, I know this is a bit late, I watched your stream and it seems like you were having trouble with your door. My suggestion is that you need to use the NOT Gate by placing a redstone torch on the side of a block under your door and then connect the block with the pressure plate. Therefore your door will always be "closed" when there is a redstone power, and will be "opened" when there is no redstone power.  I hope you read this!
Pearl talking to a warden as if it were a cat :D
this fishing thing has become some kind of virus
I'm always so excited when I see a new video from our good ol' Pearlo!!!
Pearl, you're so brave!! "Let's go kill a warden!"
excellent episode, 10/10
Grian and Gem reacting to the deaths was the best  "That's a new one" had me laughing out loud
I love how the two reactions to PapaK's... incident... are '????????????????????' and 'that's a new one', and you don't have to read who sent them to know which was Grian and which was Gem.
Bundles!
To be honest, the reaction to hearing a warden is very calm, much different to mine...   Swearing and panic, lots of both.
When pearl says collabs she means murder
12:27 sounds like someone used DBM in WoW. "Run away little girl, run away"
Joe is a fish? I thought his skin was a parrot.
Your house is so cute!!
Lofi beats to fish to
Pearl your a savage to keralis 😂
so many collabs!!
While that warden head is great….. The wither head makes a much more…. Terrifying sound
Pearl's Aussie accent really shines when she is being devious 🤣
Pearl is so Committed to being an Aussie that her first thing she does is fight the most dangerous thing in minecraft. Also she lives right next door to it just like IRL life.
"You're a let down!"
Always watching
I like how they spell your name as ‘purl’ in the game chat 😂
That first deep dark was keralis and the gangs deep dark they found in the co op mining
If you don't have a name for your mule yet Emule would be fancy kinda like Emile
I did not know that you could use a bow in your offhand....
I love keralis with all my heartt and souuull, i sweearrr I'm wheeeeziinggg, floaaattiiiingg.🤭🤧
Keralis having to breath while pearl is messing with his base made me laugh
lol every fisher has a tale about the one that got away, Joe is Pearl's lol
I love how Pearl gets more Australian the more angry she gets
"You're a letdown, but I dont talk about that" is as ruthless as Mumbo being disappointed in Ren's incompetence.. lmao
lmaooo got delivered when getting 3gapples in 1chest. I feel sory for u.. That was great!
:)
I realize I have never heard pearl say Gri. I am happy now! :)
PEARLIE POP HAS PROVIDEDDED :DD Shenanigans were in point, this day has sucked but I think its better now :)
12:12 He’s not wrong 😂 21:18 KERALIS NO 30:20 Grian and Gem 😂 31:30 Gem must’ve been so confused
24:15 She’s not PearlescentMoon, she’s PealescentMEAN 😝
I got to say, this season start has been my favorite since season 4. Everyone is just having so much fun with collabs and shenanigans
The ocean provides
Mule love over here 💝 i just wish they came in other colors like the horses 🥰🥰🥰 find me a cream mule and name him slim 😹
"Pearl.. the ocean provides."  (gives an OP bow)  Siblings will be siblings fr
XB: *summons warden* Pearl: “…and i took that personally” 11:34
I don’t know why I’m just saying this now but I love the way she says hello everyone at the beginning of her videos it’s so calming
Got snitched on by the death messages 💀
I feel like between the warden, the elder guardian and a few of the other hostile mob sounds from those heads, that at Halloween, building a haunted house is going to be great fun
I really like how she split it into 2 most YouTube’s would make it 1 and make it really fast I really like the old school Minecraft videos
I can’t wait for Grian to find out that Pearl got *2 mending books* today 😂    Purl…The ocean shall provide… but evidently not to a cod-faced guy with a fishing addiction.
Setting up a trap at spawn to try and get one or two White names: "Some of you may die... but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make."
Spoiler alert:     It did indeed.. work :D
i need moooooore Pearl ):
Until established otherwise, my headcanon has your mount's name as *Michèle Muleton* after the legendary Queen of Rally.
22:50 Pearl going all out Aussie is always so hilarious 😆
I love how in Minecraft, when someone hits you you hit them back immediately—no questions asked. Ignore what your parents taught you when you were a toddler. 😂
I don't know how to best express this, but I really hope you collaborate with hermits all throughout the season, I love your personality and humor but the voices trigger something in my autism that is very hard to deal with, so I might not be able to watch all your videos but I really really hope I get to see you in other hermits!
Is it just me, or is Grain able to hear pearl from any distance
This is Great 👍
Joe's totally been thrown off a dock😅
9:48 "He set up the whole thing... of course we had to invite him." 😆
Pearl you take all the time you need!!!! As long as you are having fun we will watch :) this season I have been smiling the entire time, the energy is totally different this season and I love it!!!!!
Love the episode.
pearls narration voice sounds like julia child
am I the only one that hears shriekers and immediately relates it to Decked Out?
the warden sound is what Gem hears right after Etho calls her "old" 🤣
Lmao just the chat “Keralis was impaled on a stalagmite while fighting a piglin”  Grian: thats a new one” 🤣
We actually heard Pearl swear.
She definitely played to much decked out, the deep dark is supposed to be scary and foreboding.  And then there is Pearl, "if i boop the shrieker with a snowball, the warden should go for beef."
Keralis' eyes here staring over the horses ears looked just pure evil 20:20
Pearl you don't get enough credit for your editing and for your creative content choices. I thought ending the video with you fishing on your mule was very nice. I really enjoyed this video :)
Pearl: * Messing with Keralis' trapdoors *  Keralis: * D E E P  E X H A L E . *
Did Cleo quote the teletubbies?!? 🤣
What's this, another Pearl episode!
does the sound change based on the block the noteblock is on? it seems like you've only ever put it on dirt/grass. it would be cool if it changed the same way the instrument does.
TALES FROM THE LOOP!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤 Turned out beautiful!!!
You and keralis working together is hilarious, and that trap worked out so well!
I caught X dying live on stream. Pearl read him like a book. 😂
17:07 lol she said log
21:22 😂😂😂
I built my base on top of a deep dark as well. I wanna start a mine right next to my base to get diamonds but I keep running into deep dark. Any tips?
after this episode i can’t stop thinking about how funny a game of hermit hide and seek in an ancient city would be
1:34 diamonds
How about making a haunted house and using the note blocks for the sounds and use armor stands for the  jump scares.
I love how *Australian* Pearl gets when yelling at Keralis about the mule
Grian: "The Ocean Provides" Ocean: "But not mending"
Between Gem’s fanart joke and the salmon noise and Keralis’s donkey, I feel like this season of Hermitcraft is decidedly slightly less PG. it’s fun
4:54 oh hi joe, also why wasnt grian talking 8:13 JOEL NOOO! WHY it sounds so wrong
This year im gonna try my hardest to keep up with both pearl and grian this season, last season i tried to keep up with you grian and gem but ended up getting burnt out for the entirety of 2023
😂  So, so much fun!
In that whisper voice i need Joe to say 2 words...           "Metal Gear"
The Warden head on note-block would be perfect for a city. Or a fake city. You could use it to make it sound like traffic.
Thanks for your video, Pearl
Woohoo ep, 3!!!
Have a good day Pearl!
Joe snuck in that bomb 😂
I think it tells something that everyone else had to use tricks and traps, but for Pearl they just used a mob.  You would have won!  but, i did enjoy the Hermit space program.
Pearl collabs just work with anyone.
“Dear diarrhoea”
Cleo: Pearl i'm right behind you  Pearl: What? *turns around* Pearl: AAH- 15:19 I loved that
Pearl, with those Decked Out 2 Level 4 harnessed MLG skills.  This lady is a professional,  people! 😅😂 I loved this collab so much. So funny! 😂
Gem's growing levels of exasperation as Keralis keeps dying to the dripstone is histerical!
Warden template is extremely rare. You got lucky.
Keralis really went: "I wanna murder Xisuma" and Pearl went: "say no more"
I would love to see a pvp game in an ancient city
I love that the hermits are hanging out and recording it more often this season. It's always a delight to see more interactions
Every time she says she’s Pearlescentmoon it sounds like she’s trying desperately to reassure herself of her identity, and honestly I love it
The bit with Joe hills where you're chasing him, tell him not to turn around, and then he turns around and chases you while still fishing rod'd. Absolute cartoon bit.
Pearl just out here, walking her Joe lol
Would red carpet work on top of the powdered snow and still allow people to fall through?
It's so funny to me how basically none of the Hermits are scared of the Warden now thanks to DO.
I love all the early season fun!!
The warden head sounds like a fart
Great episode Pearl, can’t wait to see if those pranksters actually get their wish. It so funny to how easy Keralis can die in your present. Great job Pearl❤
25:20 The Ocean provides once again
dear diarrhea, today I received a log.
"Always watching" ...?🤨
Yaaay ❤ great video pearl!
I truly can't decide who my favorite hermit is, but you're one of them!
IM AN HOUR LATE but this was such a treat from math class :>>
Yay!   I am sick in bed and  seeing this made me so happy in my misery.
I don't understand how to hermits know what the other hermits are saying/doing when they're no where near each other its happening in like everyone's videos?????
somehow the coment section from the last video i was on shows up for this comment section. so either hello from pocket telegraph sounder, or if this is only a glitch on my end, i was just watching a minecraft video.
17:29, "Dear Diarrhea, today..." - Keralis1
This video made me laugh so hard and smile so much my cheeks hurt, haha. Pearl you have such a sense of humour and your videos are amazing as always!
Yay! Double Pearl uploads this week. ❤
We've watched your episode in Ren's episode. You're a bit late
This less than 2 hours so it good cause I was watching TV and didn't get a notification
We also love all the energy this season so far. Thanks for just enjoying yourselves with one another and creating great content for us.
i love keralis his voice is so soothing
"dear diarrhoea" killed me omg
I wonder how Lizzie gonna react after that moment with Joel when he asked for the moss block 😂
Future Pearl did fine.  Past Pearl should've gone to the deep dark alone and trapped the chests, *then* cleaned up the wool and told people it was untouched.
Holy cow! So I'm watching Tangos stream from yesterday here on YT and the latest HC thing I see in my feed is Xisuma going Live on Twitch. I finish Tangos Stream video and refresh my feed... BLAM like 6 hermits all dropped videos at the same time... great I just ran out of HC10 content and yall bless me en mass with oodles more.
4:09  Replace the warden head with witch heads, and you get what Doc and Etho did to Scar.
OH NO was pearl infected with fishing too???
2:19 the bow have a flame enchantment with infinity.  I know that can't be mix right?.
.
Grian is already a Creature™️, but whenever he doesn't speak (I know it was probably because he was sick), he just becomes a full-on cryptid 🤣
I absolutely LOVE the banter between Pearl and Joe, it’s so perfect!
3 GOD APPLES IN ONE CHEST?????????? THATS INSANE
Not gonna lie I didn’t realize how many shenanigans came along in hermitctaft so glad I found pearls channel
Weeee finally got Pearl's perspective. Today is a good day
Lol doc died on the spawn one
Always enjoy a pearl video
Grian's "Purl... the ocean provides" is giving Dredge vibes
Keralis would've never died to the piglins if he just had a mule 😔
Oh boy I wonder what that cut at 8:15 was for   I hope it was nothing *SUS!*    (Jk I watched the stream)
shenanigans and chaos, my favorite kind of Hermitcraft episode!
I'm wondering how Grian knew you needed A Bow... Wait... I get it now   THE OCEAN KNOWS
I love how Keralis says "shishwami" for "xisuma"
*The ocean provides*
21:22 That, indeed, is an ass.
Not Gem and Grian utter confusion in the chat when Keralis died 😂
I've been thinking this for a while now, but apparently season X is the season of the Deep Ones.
Gem in chat reacting to Keralis dying was so funny 😂
Season 10 is shaping up to be the best. Even when helping each other they are troll each other :D
Keralis is amazing. Hilarious man.
pearl episode pearl episode!
Keralis saying thats an ass
I love the accents of the hermitcrafters. It brings me joy
surprised your not trying to kill the Tilly Killer
FINALLY SOMEONE UPLOADED TODAY 👏🏻
Pear
Keralis getting away with saying Ass simply by it being fully in context
legit stopped the HC episode i was watching so I could watch this uninterrupted before work.   we freakin love you Pearl! <3
i feel like you could make a game in the ancient city. last to survive wins. no pvp out side of snowballs.
Pearl getting 3 god apples in one chest is amazing i love it
Is Grian actually in an ocean cult.........
i love all of the angles that pearl included
Oh I’m hyped!!!! I’ve been really enjoying this season so far!!!
Yaknow joe, i think the lava scared more fish then any amount of inattentive people
I probably woke up my neighborhood after screaming pearlescent moon after seeing this in the notification Edit: fishing roding is viable with scaffolding. I tried it.
“Hello?” *warden sound* “Oh no.”
YAY PEARL! I love you so much!! You are the best! So exited for the video!!!!😊💕
Was not expecting Pearl & Joe fishing ASMR XD
Omgggg today  is my b-day and pearl posted today is the best
8:11 pearls reaction makes this so much funnier. 9:16 make it seem like you accidentally kill someone. Like make them hit a warden with a snowball and then punch them with your fist just before they get killed by a sonically charged shriek. It would not break their trust (especially if you help them to kill someone) and it doesn’t change a high rodeo if you pretend to panic to make them not suspect anything. 12:00 put the Gopples (short for god apple like Gapple) in your hotbar. 13:05 ok now I am sure you could easily get an assist kill like that. Wait what happened when you rename a mob after a player and have it kill someone? Does it revert the name from red to grey? If yes you could rename a bunch of wardens after yourself and bust chuck them in a hole and then have it be the pit of death. 16:06 someone has no armour and you have an iron axe. 16:36 again an opportunity. 20:25 is it like lifesteal that you need the kill credit or not? You could make a trap where player shot flame arrows light up TNT Minecrafts. That would be quick and give kill credit. 21:17 two of these _funny_ moments in one episode? 22:05 the dripstone can’t hit you mid air. 23:53 wait some of my comment got deleted. Ima finish this comment later.
I was laughing so hard when I watched X’s stream casually and he just suddenly fell in your trap!! I knew you were hinting at setting a trap in your previous stream, but this still caught me off guard. It was PERFECT!
Pearl you cut the best bit of the joel clip XD
I am loving this Hermitcraft season so far. All the shenanigans everyone pulled off have already made for a lot of unforgettable moments. The builds everyone are making are already very impressive and I can see why people are so excited to build these things. I hope this trend continues 😊
Pearlo the queen 👑👑
A PEARLESCENT UPLOAD HAS DOTH APPEARED BEFORE US
TFC collabed with us this whole episode too, he was just stripmining
More collabs!  🎉🎉🎉  Thank you, Pearl, you bring happiness to my flu-brain. 🤧❤️
