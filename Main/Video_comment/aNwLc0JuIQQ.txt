Dislike where djenepo's miss?
1:52 who's bloody bird is that screaming away????
Someone being murdered in the crowd at 1:52
1:56 is a beautiful thing to watch seeing the player hug the crowd in celebration we need to focus more on the positives of football in this country.
Skybet ads sounding more grimey than a skepta tune😂
Am I the only one who can hear the ewok every time Newcastle attack in the second half?
1:50 am I bugging or am I not the only one hearing that funny ass scream  from the fans 😂😂
Two teams whom will be scrapping come the End of the season to remain in the Premier League......
At least it wasn't a Bruno Fernandes-style _dodgy_ pen!
get that manc/mackem doylem out!
Newcastle United are a dangerous animal
Joelinton cut inside 😍😍😍😍
I love watching Saint Maximin play so much. So entertaining
Why isn't England playing ward prowse
Saint-Maximin will be gone next year & Newcastke will be gone
why haven't arsenal bought ward prowse yet.......
Get Steve Bruce out of our club asap. He's absolutely pants.
2:02...very amazing celebration 🥳🥳🥳🥳😎💪
ftm red nd white army sunderland till i die
imagine if ward prowse took the 5th penalty instead of saka
jwp vs newcastle fans
Daily reminder that Newcastle are getting relegated
I love Saint-Maximin..
2021 and Steve Bruce is still managing in the Premier League
Can I hear a monkey at 1:51?
I honestly don't  know how many more disssapointing results will finally make Bruce realise he isn't the right man to bring success to Newcastle. He is beyond dillusionsal and is obviously just milking every pay packet he can get and he's deliberetly doing this so he get a five million paycheque. Throwing a winning opportunity away in the 96th minute with a back 5.  Not good enough whatsoever. Useless he is. Steve Bruce must go. He's nearly dillusionsal as Southgate.
JWP should go to the Euros and WC just to take shootout penalties.
why did the goalkeeper dive 😂
Prowsey should've been in that bloody England squad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I watched that Southampton pen live. absolutely heartbreaking for us Geordies in the Gallowgate 💔
Bruce and Ashley out
When you slow the tackle by Lascelles down you can clearly see he changes the ball direction with his toe before making contact with player
Redmond with a proper assist
Lascelles is a liability. Terrible defender
This is awesome
Newcastle could do with a season in the championship to find themselves again
Prem vs Newcastle
Lascelles has cost us so much already in 3 games ...
Awful viewing with the shadows
ASM is a star in the making. Great to watch.
Wheres all the extra time come from?
Man United  next mmm let's see how long before a win
Feel sorry for the man who lost out on the 250k 😔
Commentary on this game was nothing short of horrendous
Haha Newcastle are so funny to watch yet another pointless celebration after they thought they won it in the 90th minute haha
Such a shame. Newcastle fans deserve better for their passionate support. Best fans in the land.
I’m a Newcastle fan but I will admit that was a nailed on penalty
What the hell is that shrieking in the build up to St Maximums goal?! 😂
How was that a pen, he touched his toe
Bro is it just me hearing monkey noises
Saint maxi Gucci man 🤩🤩🤩
United will win the league
United will win the league
South Hampton didn’t even know they scored the first goal and didn’t even think it was a penalty it’s just because lascells was injured
VAR ruining football
GG
The commentator is definitely a Newcastle fan, the difference in reactions to the goals lol
What a cool celebration by Saint-Maximin
I'm really worired for us this season. I feel like we are attacking fairly strongly, but our defence has seen such a massive decline since last season. Conceding 8 goals in 3 games against mid table teams is not good enough.
bro me and my cousins heart were pounding when jwp took the penalty but then we realised hes not one of the best set peice takers for nothing.....seconds later we were very happy
1:52 why is someone screaming?
Maxis celebration tho 😍
I went as mutual fan but as I live close to Newcastle I wanted them to win but st max was all over them + Wilson and could’ve scored 1 or 2 more but tbf Forster made some insane saves but disappointed for Newcastle
I will say it again R-E-L-E-G-A-T-I-O-N Stop making Steve Bruce the scapegoat, for the reckless running of your football circus 🎪  There is only ever going to be one winner, the puppet master. £££££££££££££££££££££
Commentary was class
Lascelles should of gotten a red
1:51 some woman screaming in the back 🤣
More goals this game then arsenal have points 🤫
If Rafa was still manager this would have been acceptable
Imagine Steve Bruce as your manager.....
Won’t find more biased commentary this weekend honestly, quite embarrassing to listen to.
I fear for the skunks this season. FTM
Miss u Ely😢🍀
2 possible shouts for a Newcastle penalty neither were checked. Lineman never gave Newcastle a chance and flagged everything and never let anything play out.
Goals on sunday commentator
Can we see how horrible that Southampton kit is
FIFA when you forget to change the settings to night time and overcast 🤣
Really is nothing to look forward to as a Newcastle supporter with Ashley at the helm. Dread every weekend.
People will roast man city for empty seats but not say a word abt West ham and Newcastle having empty seats
Nice celebration by JWP
Why was there a chimpanzee in the croud at 1:52
Who heard a girl screaming to death before Newcastle's 2nd?
Hey Sky Sports! This commentator is clearly a Newcastle fan. Ask him to dial it back a bit. At least appear impartial
Elyoynoussi’s goal be like: NANI
Why Southampton kit look like hashtag u ited first ever kit
Great pen
Idc salisu is the best defender in the league
Saint maximan is so good
penalty week! can’t wait for the united game cause of this
Omg we’re going down
200 million spent over two years and we still can’t beat Brentford, bloody useless….
Watched the game and after nufc went 2-1 up, surely its there first win of the season... 😳😔🙄
A  great spirited  performance by the Saints Deserved 3 points overall
deserved point for the Saints who came to play football
Never a penalty in a million years not a single Southampton player or fan even appealed for one
did saint maximin not get booked for the celebration
The way the commentator reacts to the Newcastle goal compared to the Southampton goal is hilarious
What a penalty. 👌
Im just so happy for a point my saturday evening will be ok now. southampton fan. Well played newcastle always a difficult game for us in the NE

Good game taake that
Eleyonousy scored a scuffed goal which is also an equaliser and celebrates like that? Roy keane wont be happy
BRUCE OUT
BRUCE OUT
How can anyone not love Saint-Maximin?
1:50 is that a woman or a seagull?🤣
1:49 I'm hoping that was a seagull and not a supporter
1:51 can anyone hear a chimpanzee in the crowd??
No Dubravka no party for Newcaste
The southampton goalie kit is amazing
The commentator is a bit bias 🤣 listen to how he reacts to Newcastle scoring VS Southampton
Var robbed us the win
newcastle and arsenal to go down.
Ward Prowse showing Southgate that the Euro's would've been won if he was on the team. What a penalty!
Wud have been a travesty if we hadnt got something from the game. In the end its a good point, but we shouldve put the toon to bed in the 1st half.
2:04 Breaking news, whole newcastle squad infected with covid
That 1st Southampton goal is going under the radar. unorthodox genius
Corrupt Premier league paying of the refs because they’re anti Newcastle United
Have Sky forgot that Everton played today aswell? No highlights of their game 😂
We have maximin to sometimes score but not many and we have Wilson. That’s it. Everyone else doesn’t know what to do. Our midfielders go with the team to attack but if Wilson is isolated no one else. Joelinton comes on Lascelles too slow and we draw!!!!!!!! Bring a striker a midfielder !!
Newcastle are the luckiest team in this league. The only thing that makes them a prem side is the size of their stdm.
Why have sky sports not released everton highlights yet
This keeper is woeful
Is it late to become a pro footballer at 28 or 29 years old if you have the talent and style ?

LASCELLES CAUGHT AGAIN!!!!!! IF ITS NOT MURPHY RITCHIE CLARK ITS LASCELLES!!!
So hard to be a newcastle supporter they are absolutely terrible in all aspects
How many pens we gonna give away man ffs, 3 games now 3 pens i swear. 😒
How Southampton never won this game is beyond me. Battered Newcastle the whole game
Anyone else hear screaming in the vid
Bruce out I can't say him improve
Glad to see Saint Maxi scoring!!
Disappointed with var, Disappointed with bruce and Disappointed with the performances the past few games but god I love maxi and Wilson ⚫⚪
Good News - We have a point Bad News - Should have been 3  Good News ASM is on another Level Bad News - Mike Ashley 💰💰
3 Games now  in a row decisions of var against Newcastle Masters is upto something
U come out saying the highlights r released on YouTube at 5:15 yet its now half 6 and the Everton highlights aren’t here. Joke!!!
Its embarrassing when Newcastle are playing better football than us😅😅😅
1 hour mark
3 minutes of injury time which shouldn’t have been that long and the goal was in the 96th minute. WTF
Premier League is corrupt
Both these fans getting tortured this season 😂
We want Steve Bruce out
Lascelles the liability
Sky sports why are all the games up on your channel bar the Everton one?  Don't think that's very fair dudes
Daily reminder that Steve Bruce hasn't won three consecutive Premier league games since January 2009
Was that a seagull screaming before Newcastle’s second?
Three games in and Newcastle have conceded a penalty in every fixture!!!
I thought Newcastle won that when Saint maxim scored lol
Everton highlights?
1:50 is that a Chimpanzee screaming in the background? 😳
Everton game?
64% possession, 22 shots to 10 and we were lucky to draw in the end. We must be more clinical.
Hi
no everton game highlights? joke.
Woodman needs to be dropped
var hates us
Is the commentator a Newcastle fan? Embarrassing
Steve bruce will take that result as a win ,,,
saint maximin’s celebration 🔥🔥
If these 2 teams don't struggle this season, I'll ask Scarlett Johansson to finally be my wife.
Ward Prowse scoring a penalty saved my prediction
the way elyounoussi’s goal came off his knee 😂😂😂
Is that R2D2 I hear in the background before the 2nd Newcastle goal 🤔
Captain useless strikes again
Lascelles is terrible
Adam Armstrong was never gonna score anyway
You're a professional footballer worth millions and your celebration is a golf swing...
Newcastle in the mud.
James ward prowse is a bloody legend
3 pens given away in 3 games. :(
The 2 dislikes are true Geordie and Willne
This commentator irritates me
Happy with a point, well done saints 💪🏻
get steve bruce out please
What a game! Lots of drama
3 things guaranteed in the prem Arsenal losing, Antonio scoring and Ward Prowse scoring a set piece
Pain.
If Callum Wilson stays fit Newcastle United stay up
Us and var never get along
Allen saint maximum is the best player outside of the top 6 what a baller he is also Steve Bruce needs to play 3 upfront and 5 at the back. In the meantime Mike Ashley out.
What a game from the saints!!
As a toon fan I could cry rn
Nice work from ward prowess for the equaliser!
It was a good game
Yo good video today your brilliant highlights
Djenepo disasterclass
