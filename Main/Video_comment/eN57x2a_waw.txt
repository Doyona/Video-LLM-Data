❤ Starship ❤
❤❤❤
Saturn V is the Largest
Only one of many to come Epic Failures, if they are even allowed to launch again.
BEST JOKE THE PLUSHIE MAY HAVE A FROZEN VALVE IN IT TOO😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

For those who can't wait, the launch takes place at 9:09:57 Hope this helps! :DDDD

Rocket launches emit both gases and particulates that damage the ozone layer. Reactive chlorine, black carbon, and nitrogen oxides (among other species) are all emitted by contemporary rockets.Feb 14, 2023
This valve could have been quickly fixed . All they had to do was put hot water and wrap it with bacons for 10 minutes.
New attempt Thursday 20th. Launch window opens 7:28am ET for 62 mins
Nice

Ребята вы молодцы я тоде ждал взлёт но чего все норм завтра взлетит очень ждем 👍👍👍👍
Go go go go go 😁😁😁😁
I remember a BBQ when they kept the gas cylinders too near the fire ..what a bang that was!
Aw,  heck! Looks like I missed my ride!

Well that's another 10 minutes of my life that I won't get back. Like watching paint dry🤣
🙌🚀🌌
I find it amazing how private investors have done more in 15 years than government could do in 50 years….
We've come a long way from the Mars Colonial Transporter.
What's for lunch on the star ship?
SpaceX is targeting as soon as Thursday, April 20 for the first flight test of a fully integrated Starship and Super Heavy rocket from Starbase in Texas. The 62 minute launch window opens at 8:28 a.m. CT and closes at 9:30 a.m. CT.

What the size of this thing...looks gigantic

Miren como despegan ese cohete,  es como la economía del mundo pero en vez subir cae.
Can't wait the next boom.
9 hours of air farting ? Nice
what a freak, get out of the my earth go to the moon
Why is Space X site on you tube not viewable due to violation? What violation?
Unfortunate how my browser resource use goes crazy on the memory to handle this super long stream. I gave up when the single browser tab was using 4 gig and starting to cause the page file to thrash. I only have 8gigs and a non solid state drive. I spose the browser must be relying on a decompressed representation of the video stream to index fames as even at low bit rates is still an issue...
Nice
Sun screen everyone.
bro they said discreet shipping! i want my money back T.T
Man, they really wanted that 4/20 launch…
Another great day for NSF.  Thank you for all your hard work everyone!
I can't wait for the machine to gain space.
New attempt 20.04 was announced right now 🎉🎉🎉
It is better to scrub and fix a problem and wait a week or two for a new launch then have a massive fireball and have to wait months for a new ship to be built.
Wchodzę codziennie w kartę na czasie dopóki nie zostanę kolejną osobą wylosowaną przez Ekipę WK (dzień 181)   Siema WK, pozdrawiam jeżeli właśnie to czytacie (jeżeli akurat padnie na mnie to zajebiście)
Hi Elon.  So sorry to hear that your 1st attempt failed due to a frozen valve.   We always learn from our mistakes.  I am confident that you will eventually succeed.  You inspire me greatly.   Looking forward to your 2nd launch attempt.   I look at this failure as a learning curve.   Love your unique mind set.
I feel sorry for the people who tuned in for 8 hours just to find out the launch is cancelled. Damn.
OAM vent.  Acronym means what?
is the next launch date confirmed? when is it?
Ждали, ждали и не дождались(смотрел за запуском с 14:30 по московскому времени
Widzisz mnie???
fail
Great views! Well Done guys! Jimmy Buffet View (Camera)
You should name the camera the MaRSPIC .... using the initials for the Margaritaville Resort South Padre Island Camera.... but also the camera that will capture a future MaRS mission launch.
Sawyers mom here listening to this as a podcast!He was absolutely correct.Great job NSF!
That's what test are for .
☠🌍🌎🌏🌏🌎🌏☠  Mankind should get their own house in order before they pollute other Planets.
we'll look at this in a year or two, and think "wow look how old and janky sn24 looked, wow there was no deluge installed, oh this was when they only had one tower. look how small starbase was back then" at the blistering speed SpaceX is going
already 3,2 million views! congrats nsf team for the excellent coverage.
8:11:15 Is what you are here for. Thank me later
Nasa sls same problem?
А где запуск то?Интересно, есть такие люди которые смотрели все 9 часов?
Submarine starship?
It's going to be a successful launch no worries.
Have fun
The rocket transitioned into a Rockette mid air?
Why is it night time there isn't it daylight in America Right now?
Launch that thang already
Will it be possible?  that SpaceX is being hit by a viral attack similar to the Iran nuclear plant  to slow down the US space program.🤔🤔
I guess the difference between this refueling and the one on WDR (wet dress rehearsal) a few months earlier is the time of day: 7am versus WDR in late afternoon. Possibly the early cold temperate affecting the valve causing pressurization issue? If correct, then need more temperature tolerant valves.
I'm getting tired of this, don't agree with Elon on ANYTHING any more. I'm done. Goodbye
Elon couldn’t get it up on 420 🚀
Just downloaded this masterpiece
Could the launch mass support be damaged before liftoff causing a thrust deflection
The SpaceColada Cam!
Уштыма ушпадыма
The reschedule is for 4/20…  Really Elon? Lmao
How much propane escapes unburned in a scrub?
Cool that i life in space exploration renaissance...
Pa koe bi, munuli ga? Da ga je odovud ćumatlija učukao, munuli biga. Sreknje.
I think that the hotel rooftop camera should be called the Crows nest 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Se precisarem me avisem que eu tenho durepox aqui pra emprestar 👍
Maybe it's better that it didn't launch? Otherwise it would have blown up. Musk is an egoistic idiot. He can't even land on the moon, but he wants to 'occupy' Mars. 😂 He probably will ask for more government funding. Thief.
420 should be an lucky number 🤷🏼‍♂️😅
It's nice they've chanfed the title
It crashed in the ocean 😀😁😆🤣
If that f*+king thing doesn't fly this week?? Then I'll begin to think it's all a long con
Government should have never gave Elon Musk any contracts.
I'm going to be sad when starship is perfected because I know this ship was designed to take Elon back to his home planet.
Launch one, something Fu**Ed up LOL. Almost always a scub.
How about calling the name of the roof camera Starviewer?
so that's how it would look like during launch: Black on top and white on the bottom .... that is so space X theme. Great work space x team and NSF team
Elon is stalling until 4/20.  He is just a rich kid who thinks it is funny to have a 24/7 4/20 launch.  We all knew this was this case.
It's things like this that will make Elon Musk's plan of having point-to-point rocket service on Earth impossible. Imagine you're on a jumbo jet, all excited to take your long overdue vacation when the pilot announces over the PA "Due to a mechanical failure today's flight will be canceled. We'll try again tomorrow", and you can't get on another plane because the things are so expensive they can only fly once a day. That's the state of rocketry now.
Wonder if this will give the campaign group sierra club time to lodge a court injunction to stop the launch happening.. be a shame if it does..
Maybe they needed to do an extra wdr after all
Jep😂😂😂
And it's pointy! Enemies will be petrified!
Why are they not trying to land the booster???
Told ya it was gonna scrub  :)
Uuuhhhgggg
Elon going on 420.
Super Heavy booster questions: What will be the elapsed time, speed, altitude and position downrange at staging? For Saturn C-5 it was about 150 seconds, 6000 mph, 40 miles and 40 miles (no prob being corrected on those stats)
Lmao the NSF team making bank on these livestreams
Busy ruining Twitter Musk forgot to step onboard.
Darned, I had hoped that it will fly today BUT Hey!! That's the nature of the game.  Hoping 20/4; is all go
Glad it didn't happen, I fell asleep
Rocket launches are the major cause of the increasing disastrous climate anomalies.
Grrrrrrrrr
How does it feel to host or follow the chat for 8 hours and then at T-8:40 SCRUB? I bet that cost a nickel or two. 🚀
Che hermano, como no van a tener subtitulos para los que no sabemos Ingles?

Live my ass
How long till launch???
🚀🤦‍♂️😳🤝💪✌️👑🛩🛸
Thanks for the heads up raptor!
Did Elon find an excuse to launch on 4/20?
They may find life on Mars but never food for starving
加油
😢
you might want to mention in the title that it was a scrub
and as usual~~
Hah the pos failed to launch again
For anyone that doesn't know there was a pressurant valve that froze and called off today's attempt
Has this thing launched yet?
SUUIIII
nine hours... and I think i watched about 99% of it. LOL
did it launch?
Wow, what an awesome day even though it didn't launch. CU 4/20 I guess! 😜
🗿
First
Does anyone know when the next launch attempt will be?
