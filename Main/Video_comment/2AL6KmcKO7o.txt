Mick looking extra nice in thiese new Suits
Damn the sound of the engine🤯
This is the 1.... Mark my word
Good lawd the car looks so good.  Did Mick get to drive it on track as well?
Indeed we all of proud of what a marvellous job the team has done!! Hope all the hard work pays off and our team will be back on the championship fight this year!! 🖤🖤
Let's them come ...we waiting.i know   the 🐐  will answer the call 🖤💜👑💯
I'm a simple man. I see black Mercedes, I press like
Watch the video, and then porpoise back to 0:35
Bahrain can't come soon enough!
Glad you figured out the porpoising maybe Back in Black is a good omen fingers crossed the either Lewis gets his 8th title or George gets his 1st, can’t wait for the season to start.
Ugly AF, sorry. I really wanted to like it, really really hard. I just can't. The worst looking car on the grid by far in terms of overall shapes and bodywork. I hope you'll abandon this stillborn concept for good.
Looks awesome!
Lets GOOOO!!!! I am Pumped!!!
In *W14* We Trust. Amen
0:39 That view 🤌🤌🤌🤌
You made Mick bring his helmet but did you give him a few laps at least?
Seeing Mick next to Lewis and George made me smile to see him be happy 😊
The black bullets! Let’s go ❤💯
Shumi looking good in that black and blue 🔥
Let’s go team 😍🔥👏🏻🇬🇧👑
RB19 AND SF23  KILLER <3
🐐44🐐
So much of hype i swear they have to deliver.
Darth Vader 😊
Amazing!!!!
Looks like its not bouncing like a kangaroo. That’s good
I'm not typically a Mercedes fan, but I'm really rooting for them this year. It's brave of them to take an entirely different approach to the regulations, and they are the only true underdog team this year with a shot at the title. And it's hard not to be excited about that driver lineup!
Why dont you guys to for the fully exposed carbon look? Youre the only team that can pull this off with a great looking livery
Hey Lewis!!!. There are 260 Million Brazilians Cheering for you the Star guys!!!. Good Luck!!!.

So glad I did not hear "Get in there, Lewis" for the whole last season. Lets hope it's the same this year, he has won more than enough, let other people win for a while. Once we have another 8 times winner Lewis can win again.
Please make George's car no. matched to the color of his helmet (the icy blue), just like Lewis's.🙏🙏
We are so ready for this season
Does Mick get a chance to drive during testing?
We're so clear 🤣 it's not even funny. 16 & 18 wins just for the laughs, Lewis, Mercedes?
it runs straight.. so far so good.
Wait so lewis and Mick have same colour helmet
More!!!
Go, George, go!
Good luck to all of you guys, that the Star will shine your efforts!!!.
This has much of w11 energy........Good luck for the season Mercedes!! Go win that championship that you deserve for all the hard work and effort you put on to build this Monster.🔥🔥
Great job team, best legal car on the grid for sure and all the best this season!💜
Why can't I download it🤧
I see no bounce....then again I doubt if they  hit full speed since it is a filming day
It sounds amazing 😍🔥
Can't wait to see Lewis on the top step of the podium.
I love merc ,this car is giving me predator vibes
Good luck, time to put the bull to sleep 😄
In my opinion, this car in this colour is sooooooooooooo sleek and sexy looking. I know Mercedes are "the silver arrows", but I truly missed this colour from last year. Even my F1 simulator wheel is fully decorated in a combination of the 2020/21 Merc liveries.  I cannot wait for the season to start and watch the arrows take down the bull 🏁🏁🏁🏁
Simply Gorgeous even my new bank card synched up on the same day same colours🤩😍💋
Finally😢❤
Let mick drive the actual car too. Not just sim work. Paapa he is
Let's go, fantastic job 🔥🔥👏👏🏎🏎, beautiful car 💪💪.
🤩
The last shot of Lewis, George and Mick is so bad ass. Back in Black baby!
No Propoising spotted i suppose..but it can be dependent on tracks also...overall looks a fruitful year for the team
Hope it will be a beast
0:44 what are those tires ? Never seen them before
Go go go Mercedes-Benz AMG F1 champion constructors and driver 2023....... . From Brazil 🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
No bouncing?? 😃😃

I AM SO PROUD TO BE A MEC FAN THE CAR LOOKS BEAUTIFUL BEST OF LUCK THIS YEAR LET'S GO LEWIS IS HAMMERTIME BABY 🔨🔨🔨🔨🔝🔝🙌🙌💯💯
I DONT SEE BOUNCINGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this car looks too good to be true. I really hope it’s competitive
schumacher at the end was beautiful i hope this is a good season for mercedes
💛💙💚
😍🥰
Always see the yellow number and think of legendary valentino rossi. Still Remember the lewis and rossi video on sky when lewis told rossi how much he loves the colours rossi rode with and the year rossi retired, lewis started using the rossi shade of yellow too. 9 time champion and 7 time champion. Legendary. If you haven't seen that video, you should.
Looking mean and ready.
Awesome Car guys, will there also be an oboard video?
Come on men👍👍
Not the best start clearly. Storm Eunice last year & engine issue this year forcing a 1 day delay which meant running on a colder/wetter day than planned. Let’s hope Bahrain testing goes better else we’re in for de ja-vu
Mercedes 2023!
What a beautiful car ❤
cool
Sickest looking car on the grid, hopefully w14 has some serious pace this season.🔥🔥🔥
Hoping we get 10 teams fighting for the championship this year!!
omg the W14 is sexy af🔥
Go for the 8th LH44❤
i lovee this livery😍😍
Is amazing  🔥🔥🔥The best car of the grid  Come on Mercedes  This chapmioship is our

So excited for Bahrain testing next week! 😤
Last season was tough year for the Silver Arrows but this year there is a sense of optimism that they could be back fighting in front which is promising looking forward to Bahrain Pre Season Testing.
Fingers crossed 🤞Let's go!!!
Everything with the car is made perfectly
Awesome seeing Mick with them
The Empire strikes back. Pls destroy everything this year
