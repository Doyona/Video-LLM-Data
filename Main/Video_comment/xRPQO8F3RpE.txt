Hell yeah! Finally it is ✅ finished! Let's destroy the Xenomorph!
but the powerloader walks? this started cool, but then you cheated, using a skidsteer to move and it already had all the hydraulics built in you just built two grip arms? This is not a suit. I hope this was a phase 1 and you are going to take that top half and move it over to some legs.
One thing you forgot is movable weights so when you are picking up heavy weights the weights move to keep you in balance just like a robot it shifts its weight and to do that you have to put sencer in the hydraulics  as more pressure increases to lift the weights move correspondingly  just a idea
SCV good to go !
I find it funny that the powerloader would have been great to use when taking apart the powerloader to finish it xD
Protip, watch out for honey...
3 years late but it’s finally done
The Caterpillar P5000-T is complete!  (T for “tank/treads” as opposed to the bipedal model from the movie)  Yes, I know I’m three years late to the party.
Bogdan and the whole team did an amazing job. Just mind blowing to see it all come together. Congrats
That hard lined tubing is sleek!!
so how heavy is it in real life because we have no idea how heavy it is in film and it looks close enough to the pfe because we have no idea how heavy it is in film and it looks close enough to the movie version we could at least make guess work
Impressive but I wanted the beast to walk. It’s a ‘power stroller’ to me. Hopefully you guys can keep the upper torso and get that bitch some 🦵🏻’s!
super gut
You guys should try making the fabrication machine from 9 that is if you have the guts to make it
Hm I was hoping for walking legs 😂
You should make power armor from fallout!
real footage of tord’s robot 2.0
Make a bumblebee suit
In all honesty, this might actually bring humanity forwards technology wise.
Wow dude , you’re a real life Tony Stark ! 😎
Thats not a power loader lol
heat of the desert, dust settles on my face
Why do i feel like the American DoD is watching you guys and drooling as they go...  DoD: "C...Can we use a Black Budget to just let him keep working on stuff? He has a Lot of...interesting ideas..."
Did anyone realize the joysticks top looks like the aliens head? 🤔 Amazing project
For the power loader
What I think you should do is instead of making you stand it's a seat that will raise up after you press a button and then you buckle in.
How exactly did the subnautica mobile vehicle bay build my cyclops in 9 seconds
A lot of hard work to make something which is not the power loader from Aliens. 💩
Ok now make a gundam in real life😂
...stand by for titanfall
Bro I've been following for almost 8 years now damn
their old junker car is newer and nicer than my daily driver...
Wonder if CAT has emailed yall for the schematics
Killdozer ... just saying
Day 1 of asking for bone lab bodylog
Ain'tt those joysticks from virpil? The bases too.
Thats a lot of money spent 😵😎
ITS ALIIIIVE!!!! AHAHAHA!
it's amazing what men can do
Can i buy/ have the plans for this please. I need to build one for my shop.
5:30 bro is rizzing her up
You think he's got the power to make the AMP suit from Avatar
If you guys added some legs and recolor little bit and added some more things it look like a prawn suit from Subnautica
How much you sellin those for?
Now thatz bad azz ,   All u need now iz  Warrent officer 1st  LT . Ellen  Ripley
powerloader P-9000 😍😍😍😍
Ok, no way to sugarcoat this. And since I'm an engineer myself I know how this might feel. Its an awesome feat of machine that you manageged to get goind. But its not the loader from "Aliens". That one walked by beeing activated from the legs of the user. Yours is basicaly a yellow fancy forklift on tracks. Kudos to get it working, but dont call it a loader.
Why spraypaint the camera tho... just for a cinematic shot😂
Looks great, the welding is questionable though….
Great video guys!! So great to see all that hard work pay off. Keep it going with the crazy ideas 😁
Now do the gun loader from borderlands 2. You won't
Kennt man in den USA keine schneidringe?
You should invite Sigourney Weaver to ride this bad boy.
Dumb suggestion but it reminded me of the centry bot from fallout, maybe that next?
You should show this thing to Adam Savage :)
"WARNING, NOT ONLY WILL THIS KILL YOU, IT WILL HURT THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE DYING" A pretty effective way to get the message I see
This is great but how come it doesn't have legs like on the movie?!!
Spending a million dollars to make a less efficient version of the forklift that you used to hold up the top of the thing.
Nice job! Now cat needs to put it in production.
Hi
and by you should i mean you need to
next you should make a full sized hulk buster mech
how did i miss this video... i remember when the first video came out
Ask Sigourney Weaver. She'll be super impressed.
Ask Sigourney Weaver to pilot the Power Loader please. She'll be super impressed.
SCV good to go sir!
look the real loader yours its simple real loader have legs not tracks
I want one please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 go 🇺🇦
Having to take the whole thing apart is a good reminder to always build something to be easily taken apart, just in case anything goes wrong anywhere in the process, or if changes need to be made
Well, I can't find the hose I am looking for but I did see another one that was cracked and so maybe you got the message i-di-ot and you now know that if you do not replace all of those hoses you are going to have a pop-off that will take half your face off and it is the hose that is more than frayed, it is missing some rubber at the fitting.  When you pick up a car or a truck with something that has cheap frayed hoses you are running the risk of a serious catastrophic injury and I think you know what I mean.  Also, those hoses should be tethered to that machine just in case there is a pop-off and that is all I know.  And that is all I know.  And that is all I know.  And that is all I know.  And that is all I know.
Bogdan is one of the most loyal subscribers I have ever seen to hacksmith
AIN'T NO WAY THEY USED VIRPIL FLIGHT SIMULATION JOYSTICKS
I got the normal suv what you got "titan fall"
21:6 when your efforts were worth it.
I like this power loaderSo I am your new subscriber
Where's the huge rpg
<333
Looking suit from grim advertiser of  Billy and Mindy the video game on playstation
Even tho you want it to look as original as possible, if this is something that is to be used around the shop regularly for heavy objects, it may be best to have some sort of leg guard. The head and torso is enclosed, but the legs are out in the open. Especially if lifting a large load and it some how pivots and swings back and forth, it may strike someone’s legs
really hope that honda element was already going to a junkyard. theyre nice cars. kinda like an fj cruiser and a pontiac aztec had an autistic child that was awkward but good at everything. like me, autistic but good at everything.
love that this kid in the beginning is just itching for recognition from some cashier that really just doesnt care.
make a exoskeleton suit guyss
Question: how are you guys not working for the military
You make a real roof because something sharp Google through the hole
After 3 years find
Wow😱
How about a real life transformer car that transform into car to robot
21:30
Get away from her you ****
Basically this is a bobcat that u stand in and is more versatile
Standby for Titanfall
I wish I had a mech :(
I suggest you upgrade this to the  human-operated robot as seen in the AVATAR movie used by the military, in the future
The crazy part about binge watching this series is watching them grow up. That really pounds the point home how long they’ve invested in this project.
Only took 3 years lol.
We need hulk buster
amazing! amazing! amazing! !! I want to ride it once! I want to work with this!
Thousands of dollars, hundreds of hours, and an unbelievable amount of skill and passion to make something this incredible.   I hope i make something one day that truly inspires someone like Aliens clearly did for you. Awesome work
Bogdan big strong 💪
Finally
What you think the tensile strength is on those welds
Time carddddds!!!
Can you make a tank
James would be proud
Different legs... Why tracked?!
Wonder how much you made on all the videos to make this ..
This could be useful for construction and demolition alike. Awesome.👍😎
Not only will this thing kill you, it will hurt the entire time you're dying. I have GOT to find that sign
Incredible
They built a mecha. A real, honest-to-god mecha.
Not totally sure but from what I understand, Bogdan has been a main driving force for this project… bogdan really stepped up and owned this project. The whole team did amazing but damn good job taking lead bogdan
Make a very smart robot
Danger danger
The first mecha suit for the war
hacksmith industries in 2040:  today we are going to build bt-7274 from the game titanfall 2
they came a long way to get this done
Welp. Now it’s time to make BT-7274 😂
I see your guys pain and tear on this project
This should be put on display at a local CAT dealership man shoots 😂 Fr tho that would be cool to see
Can't tell you how excited I got watching the last build video, love what you guys do keep up the great work 👍
When Bogdan screamed at the car, I could feel all of his stress, fury, and tiredness leave himself, he was so happy it was done Great job, you took something that seemed almost impossible, and made it real
i like to imagine that he is a blacksmith and he really likes to make videos about the things he makes for adventurers
Holy shit finally
chujpwe
All they do is destroy cars and SUV's a waist of talent and money.
Great! Now it's time to build an AC from the game "armored core" and I can die happy now.
Next built a titan from titanfall 2
Kool
Now let's get to da choppa
You can rest now.
I would love to see you make the pronsuit from subnautica
Honestly I think they struck gold here, this thing has limitless practical possibilities and if they work on a patent and negotiate with the original designers who introduced the power loader they could sell this to hundreds if not thousands of construction, quarry, mine, etc. Companies since this is brand new in the sense of not being real and available
Nicccce
Sell the design to Caterpillar
Holy crap i go to that exact princess auto
After what I have seen so far of things you did (it´s a lot). I wonder if you could try to make a Power Armor from Fallout like for example the T-60. It would be nice to see. But anyway I like how you made the Powerloader so nice and detailed.  But most importend keep on doing what you are passionate about.  (Sry for my bad english)
Wow this looks like the AMP's from avatar, only no legs and fingerless arms
I used to not like the guy that drove the power loader I thought he was annoying now I think he's cute and just playful -w-
So now that the joysticks are partly inSTALLED
If someone try’s to rob there warehouse the robber is just dunzzo done sayonara
Yea he
Next we will see hacksmith om the news
This is why I love engineering
I am glad you guys aren't super villains
Yes
Build more
Please make an actual giant Gipsy danger and make a striker eureka to fight each other
Good job guys, you finished it! I remember watching the first episode a few years ago, and now I'm here!! The whole channel has come a long way since then. Awesome!!!!
It's on tranks not a power  loader
Incredible! Great job
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE POOR ELEMENT ;-;
what if the military got some ideas from this
You guys are incredible
I feel like I've seen this machine before
Where are the legs if you can make that I will be blown away
I'd like to help design something can you reach out?
I think you guys should make a force thing to go with the light saber
This is a Awsome! Best thing Ive ever seen! I Dont Think Anything Can Get Better Than This! This is Legit Crazy! My Eyes are Litrally Suprzied About This Thing! Keep going Smith your Doing Great All The Things You Did Are amazing!
Can you make iron man hulkbuster
Felicitaciones por terminar el POWER LOADER después de 2 años......gran trabajo
Next the alien.
That "DANGER" sign, LMAO
Now, I'm impatient waiting till Hacksmith makes a TitanFall Mech.
idk if this would work but what if you built baymax
I'm a fully certified welder. Looking at your welds in the video you need to up the amperage to burn in more and get a stronger bind. Also judging by the looks of the welds, most of them seem to be done fairly quick, welding if done properly should take time for better work. Amazjng work none the less with everything
IDk man i think this process has finally driven Bogdon insane i mean just listen to that scream
INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!! AWSOME!!!
How could something so tremendously amazing be made by someone so god awfully cringing
yessir I can subscribe! You EARNED it in every way. I first got your final testing vid in my feed because I'm an alien-geek, but I saved that vid to view after I've seen your building process of 16 vids long. Too good this, going to get a drink first before I watch the final one. So stoked :)
Why the masks?!??!! Ffs! Enough with the bullshit already.
This is not a po
Colleges needs to back these guys this place teaches a lot
Bogdan, a rage AI
Cool...................................                                Now give it guns.
Sure seems like there should be a cage protecting the operator's legs. Since this power loader does not walk. It also seems more practical for there to be a seat. Otherwise, the operator will get tired quickly.
BAY 12 PLEASE
PLOT TWIST:  during the sponsorship Bogdan says that there so close to finishing but in the background you can see the finished model
Ha ha wah wah wah ha ha wah 🙄😳
You guys should invite Sigourney Weaver out to look at it!
Wish we had those kinda shops over in the UK
I hope they try and make power armor from fallout next that would be sooooooo cool
I've loved watching engineers become the fabricators and mechanics for a change 🤣 so awkward sometimes but you can see the light going off like wow I really engineered that fucked for the mechanic 🤣
Quick question for anyone who wants to answer, if the arms are moving, and there is hard hydraulic piping in the arms, how do the arms move and not break the piping?
I still don’t agree with the Tracks
I can see tons of actual applications for this thing in warehouse work.
it looks so badass
Prawn suit
I want to see a fight between 2 of theese
i call bravo sierra
*if anyone watched the lego movie then they would know what this looks like :)*
me who doesn't know how to nail a shelf into a wall: Yeah, I fully understand this!
I wonder if you guys could actually sell these. They may have utility value.
cant whait to see if its real that powerfull as they claimet, so that it can easy lift a car and many more test. Not only lift the car but then transport it
Imagine someone showing up to comicon wearing this.
Release every Micro-Manager we HAVE!
Next up should be ED-209 from Robocop.
Ok now that the power loader is done on to the fallout power armor
This thing is awesome!! You all did a great job!
Thinking the clarify 16 episodes actually
I can actually see this powerloader working in factory where i work. We produce large spools of wire mesh for car seals and it's pain and it's also pretty dangerous taking them off since se have to use forklift... Also i would cry to have the powerloader in our factory. What an amazing work guys!!!
Oh to be a forklift operator at Hacksmith Industries
NICEE!
One day I want to work for hacksmith industries
You should do a power loader battle like the lightsaber one but power loader vs cybertruck or powerloader vs civil warriors shield
You definitelly should take 3 more years and make it with legs. This looks like a broken digger :-(
I know I'm a bit late for the comments to be seen by you guys at the hacksmith industries but I just wanted to say could you make a Real Steel robot that can fight other robots. Just like the movie. I just want to see if it is possible because I want to create one too
Watching this series for last two years finally it's done I wanna see the finale of this series
You could sell this on the market to manufacturers cause it holds some good potential and also cause I want to own one
The U.S military :  Write that down Write that down!
I have been waiting for this for months!!
Bogden needs a vacation now
Imagine if the next alien movie features this as a prop..
21:06 Captain Bogdan is getting literally electrified
Hmmmm……   What if you attached a potato canon/T-shirt canon on the side?
A mad man in a mech suit... This will end well.  :D
my god this is amazing, great job guys!!!
That scream in the intro didn't sound like someone having fun. That sounded like abject horror at one's own impending death... or maybe the origin story of a supervillain.
14:58 Bogdan: Look at that, so easy. Also Bogdan: *struggles to put it on*
Couldn't figure out how to make it walk?
excellent
it looks THAT amusing (or gramaly)
Imagine Their next project being a titan from titan fall
This video is the equivalent of 100% complete please wait
Coool
The amount of hours that are put into these videos...
2068: "We finished the first arm of Eva-01."
Hello infinity some thing related please
its a bit fast
The reverse alarm on that forklift is the cutest thing ever lmao
HOW DARE YOU END IT THERE!!!!!
Oh man I could FEEL the sheer joy Bogdan had ramming the car.  It must be such an enormous relief.
Next Mech: The Construct-O-Mech from the Lego Movie
You should turn this into a Hulkbuster armour
Now you need the one from avatar
Finally… it is done… 😑
I was thinking about this project the other day. It looks awesome
You guys should take the power loader to the hardware store you guys bought all those fittings from lol
It would be cool if they made a gyrosphere
Yay
Ok, now mass produce it
I like how the joystick looks like an alien head
When will you guys make the mobil infantry armors from starship troopers traitor of mars and the marauder from "invasion". These armors are so bad ass!
Anyone else wanna see the star wars speeder bike?? Like how awsome would that be
Man, they should make some fallout 4 power armor
Is this really a power loader when it has tracks instead of legs?
If it doesn’t walk than you fail
I just realized that the joystick tops are Xenomorph heads!!!
Nice
When are you going to give it walking feet like the real thing?
So when are you going to “Power load” something ?   Disappointed !
Make a vision robot that flies
Woah
Pogu
Coool!!!
18:24 Is that an LTT shirt I see...
Is this the first ever melee mecha?
sischt nicht ze tie?
Dobra robota
Make a atomic bomb
They had one of these in the movie alien 25 years ago.
It’s been 23 episodes since the mandolorion armor! Where is the test
Yeah, We need this stuff because we're building a giant robot to enslave all of humanity so I was wondering if I can redeem my credit card points, use my discount and this coupon all together? Money is getting tight.
cool, I'd recommend putting some protection around your legs ;)
This is epic guys! Not even a huge Alien fan, but I love this build! Now, something even more epic, how about those war machines from the Matrix? Similar mech type thing, but even bigger, badder, and more challenging? :P
the beginning of titanfall
Image you break into some warehouse, lookin for something good to steal or so, and like, 2 dudes with lightsabers run at you, a 3rd is wielding Thor's hammer, and a 4th in is a powerloader, welding a car like a club.
real nice just a shame that the power loader in the film "Aliens" was a bipedal walker not a cat track
It's cool, but is it actually useful like a forklift etc?
To bad the arms are not actually long enough because if the tank tread bottom to be proffessionaly usefull. Good effort.
erm isnt it supposed to walk like in the film ?
....id be curious what CAT thinks about this.....as far as ideas ....i mean this is just awesome
Can you imagine the feeling of satisfaction in that workshop seeing this project come to life?!? Too cool
It's more than a movie prop. IT has practical application as well, because its has Three Dimensional movement making it better than any forklift you have, and it's excellent for exterminating XENOMORPHS
I feel like you took the easy way out if this is a final product. The best part of the power loader was that it was an exoskeleton. Not a BobCat. This is not groundbreaking. There is way more impressive machines used in common industries like tree strippers. Great job doing half of an awesome project. You have gone from innovators to toy makers.
Хрень какая-то. Погрузчик нужен, чтобы что-то поднять. Снизу взять и перенести. Или наверх поставить. А у этой фигни ноги в коленях не сгибаются, как у оригинала. И наклониться он не может. В общем, перевели кучу материала и времени, а на выходе пшик. Ну, может, переделают.
I wonder if these guys have been approached by any big companies wanting to mass produce the power loader. Or if they will be approached lol.
You guys have been working on this for weeks! Glad to see its done.
Please get Sigourney Weaver to use this!!!
Omg you've actually done my dream hope i had this one
im a heavy online shopper, i used honey for a year it didnt find a working promo code once.
The first half a power loader. The movie version didn't have tracks
Day 1 of asking Hacksmith Industries to build VI's boxing machine from the recent netflix series "ARCANE"
looks very  nice well done .
Build a working Rick and morty teleportation gub
Make a Batman tumbler
Absolutely amazing project! So great to see it finished. Just need govt agencies to follow suit. Shit-ton of work, least ya got a forklift. Couldn't imagine trying to do that in my garage with a cherry picker.
WOW
hahaha, Id sack guys for welds like that
I can just imagine sitting on my couch at home when that comes straight through my wall, good job in finally finishing it
Damn. All them brains and not one person can weld 😂😂😂 I love his Face when he tries to bend metal. Great concept but Old Farmer Joe in his Backhoe will knock you over in 15 seconds 😏👍 cuz ya got no swivel. Dare Ye fight a Real CAT with your modified CAT. Would make Great content and destroy alot of things. 😎
👎
"little" developing and re engineering, this thing could have use in many industries
Destroying the Honda Element made me very sad.
Making a device that handles and manages heavy, sharp, flung, and/or hazardous materials immediately forward of its position, and then mounting the squishy easily deadifiable bio-mechanical brain of the system in a forward facing open cab with little to no protection.  What could possibly go wrong?!
Doesn't walk.
skip to 21:01 - you're welcome
And now! It needs some sound effects and Ripley soundboard lines, i.e. "Get away from her, YOU B!TCH !!! LOL
Powder coat CAT yellow ye  bitches! That's what CAT does
next make a pacific grim robot
Imagine if this was a live stream!
Super awesome guys and I even learn stuff every video :D You've made one beautiful machine!
I hope the editors get years of use out of Bogdan's primal screams at the end there, those sound like they have a lot of replay value.  What a journey.  This turned out amazing!
They are gonna be first to make holograms
The fact they finished the same day “the binding of isaac: repentance” was released on xbox one
What’s keeping your legs from getting crushed? Seems like an unsafe design
Will Hacksmith Industries actually use the power loader around the shop, like a forklift?
Colin Furze hasn’t commented yet? This should make him giddy. Well done all! 😃👍🏻👌🏻👏🏻
In the future, when America is at war, these things will be mass produced
It was my dream ever since I was in my 6 th grade to work in hacksmith industries
Every video you get closer and closer to becoming A marvel Super villain or superhero
Give the power loader to fishing with Flair
3 years! Wow. What a project. What an engineering masterpiece and what a team!!! Damn impressive
This was incredible ... Loved it guys you did a really fantastic job .... and over the course of so much time I am sure the final testing is gonna be lit
20:11 nice virpils, im not jealous at all
Who disliked this video?
Not that I would even have the money to buy this but what would you sell this for?
Will this be the next construction vehicle to obliterate a small town?
The person at the store he is probably lying mean while
Maniacal laughter... Have you been speaking with Colin Furze? I warned you about him...
That dude at the end sounded like a super villain from Spiderman.  Ready for some serious carnage!
Amazing project even though its only for youtube they spare no expense to making it better and look cool, very cool project
Check Bogden going for Linus's king of Segway title XD
I'm so glad you guys do what you do.  This sort of thing is inspiring and wonderful to see.  I can't thank you enough for making these things happen.
So you’re going to let Sigourney Weaver drive it if possible, right? Because I think we can all agree that would be really badass.
I'm amazed the hardware and automotive stores near you don't treat the crew like Norm from Cheers every time you walk in the door.
Time to throw down the gauntlet to MegaBot and Suidobashi, but I don't think either want to be beaten upon with their own yanked-off limbs.
Just needs an M2 and Mark19 instead of claws for some firepower
i can tell u right now, that cashier didn’t give a fuck lmao
Imagine hacksmith industries with a military budget dude would legit be Jonathon irons
Version 2 next with legs? :) Very nice work!
Yassss its done. Been follow the process  and cant wait to see it wreck some stuff 😈
Woah, guys look it's Loader's suit from the game risk of rain
You need leg covers
Bloody Hell, you boys did it, and quite nicely too! I just binged the last 16 episodes, nice presentation! That Trak Loader really saved yer butts! Solved a multitude of problems in a single chassis! Very much looking forward to Ep.17  The Show & Tell !!!!
Bro think if they where after you your fucked
I think you've done a great job, but I have a question. Wasn't the loader in the movie a walker? I don't remember it having tracks.  Edit: whose car did you destroy at the end of the video?
Take over the world
Nope
A better input system could make this more natural to pilot, but I understand keeping to the original prop
I like how you guys used the Virpil Alpha sticks which look like xenomorphs haha
the shoping trip is my favrote part also i have the same red van
Soo cool!!!! Glad to see you get this finally wrapped up, it's been a long time coming.
This looks like something that could actually be used for construction or areas where a forklift wouldn't work well.
the controllers look like xenomorph heads  sick
Why do I feel like a company is going to mass produce this
You should lift Stormbreaker with it.
nicely done guys =)   ....  if your not careful, CAT might just try n steal your design =P  lol  but that would be one heck of a pay day wouldnt it  =D
gotta live the irony of using a forklift to build a suit that essentially replaces a forklift :)
SCV commi'n up!
los niños yanquies siempre tienen que romper algo para ser felices, en verdad me alegro, vengo siguiendo del primer capitulo el avance de esta maquina, pero no esperaba que al final demostrara su inmadurez rompiendo un vehículo en buen estado
"Get away from her you bitch"
90% into the video and now your wearing masks lol......wwwwhhhhyyyyyy
Noice.
no mini flame welder no deal
PA FTW!  I love going there.  Even when I don't need anything. But I always end up find something "I needed".  :D
12:46 imagine how many go pros and cameras people go through just to get that effect cause i dont think whatever they used to record that scene made it
It’s like looking at the future
Hmmm... do we need cable's for hydraulics nowday, while with a good combination with strong magnetic materials like neodium magnets to connect every internal skeleton steel bones (input any program the magnets so it can turns to any direction  + elastic fibre  as  muscle's (program to  move and respon your command + gyroscope to every steel bones.. So you can build exo skeleton that can do self balance and even more faster movement  ....  ☕😅🚬 I know, Its still seems impossible to create such advance and complicated exo skeleton tech lol
Next project: make mech to disassemble the mech 🤣
Hi hacksmith im a big fan  and i was wondering if there do you watch anime and if you do can you please make kurikara from the blue exorcist please
Next...the Reaver (sp?) suits from 'Edge of Tomorrow' or the AMP suits from 'Avatar.'
You guys should make a High Frequency Blade from Metal Gear
dont mind me just skipping to the end of the video
Great now make a working AT-ST.
whistlin deisel should buy it
"pro-ject"? - Canadian?
(I know about the challenges, I've watched this whole series.) GIVE IT LEGS. MAKE A MECHA THAT CAN WALK. (Then I will harass you about flight capabilities)
Amazing I remember when you started the project
How to get girls attention. Tell them you're building full size power loader robot.
Next project: a real life mobile suit gundam
Did james become thinner cause he doesn't seem as bulky as in his earlier videos.
All that and more and you still didn't make it walk.    Its just disappointing.   Great effort.
awsome bulid but please chill with the advertising it comes every 2 min
You guys are absolutely crazy! I love it!
It's cool but, I wish you could have made it bi-pedal like the original (I'm sure you do too). Perhaps the next version?
Hi May I ask do hacksmith has a Chinese TikTok 'douyin' account???
I am praveens
Please build optimus prime rebot in witch you can sit
Hack smith will you make me a working Ironman helmet I am abbesses with him please
I wish the would of went with legs! Oh well! Great Job Guys!
You know when there is inevitably another alien film be it prequel or sequel you guys might just get a call from the studio asking to borrow this for filming
I hope somebody has invited Sigourny Weaver to have a go! Photo-shoot at least?
It So Familiar Like Mobile Worker From Mobile Suit Gundam Origins 😮
Kinda weird how this was James dream and he wasn’t even in the video
this looks incredible
Nice. Eunectes approve this! 👍 XD
Make a working Hawkeye foldable and quiver
I know this is a replica but I'd say this would be a great idea for a terrain unit version of the power loader. Rather than have the legs by themselves where you could probably easily tip the vehicle over, when stepping down a slope or a pothole, you instead have treads to keep steady on said ground with such hazards. I'm just saying, this could be brilliant for a different type of power loader. It's practically pure genius.
This is amazing think of what search and rescue workers coud do with this move hole cars destroy walls its amazing
for years ive been asking hacksmith to build the tf2 sentry gun in tf2 if they have not much work to do and this might be very close       i just wish they build one if there all done with there awesome tech machines and inventions im being very patient about it i started to ask for him to build a tf2 sentry ever since he build torbjorn sentry i just hope i get to see if he has more time to manage it its ok if he build a level 1 2 or maybe a 3 would be cooler and i really wanna see it shoots like bb bullets would be fine and if the rockets are able to shoot that would seriously even cooler and maybe he could build a dispenser and a teleporter to a full set engineers buildings its been years since
Ive literaly watched this project go on since i was 10 💀💀 how its finished 🥲😭😭 i feel proud 😭😭👍
Bogdan: *Buys something with james credit card*   Also bogdan: “Sorry james”
20:10 Does anybody notice something kind of food about the joysticks?
I am also waiting Love from Tamilnadu
You should make a doctor who sonic screwdriver that opens doors and does other stuff from the series
Feel like bogdan enjoyed that last part a little too much 🧐
congrats!
Nerds are becoming more powerful
It’s been so long…
Now go get in partnership with Elon musk
Still waiting for the iron Man chest piece with a chest repulser but great achievement guys🤩
Attack on titan ODM gear plz plz
"SCV gonna go Sir!"
Admittedly I haven't follower your project but having seen the movie I don't remember the loader having tracks. I'm disappointed.
so he made a standing bobcat with grips...
Could you guys patten the power loader? Hollywood faked it but you guys actually made it and there's nothing like it on the market. Thanks
All it needs now are some guns and armor plates
Now the power loader needs a home: time to start building pieces of the Sulaco for in-orbit construction.  (and if not that, maybe the APC that the Colonial Marines rode around in)
You should make the sword from Doom eternal
Based on that last bit, I think he has a bright future as an inmate somewhere being fed through a tube while heavily medicated.
How many years away is hacksmith Inc?
He went mad with POWER!
That was a loong journey! Congratulations, you guys finally did it!
Oh my precious Princess Auto the builders paradise store!
This was 100% awesome. I absolutely  cannot wait to see more of this thing. Congrats to bogdan and the team! Great job!!!
This is so awesome!😎👍
next time put all your hydro hose mgmt inside thestructural tubingmuch cleaner looking and theyer protected
Go to megabots and challenge your mech.
Do Hawkeye and his arrows and the bow and qouit6
what is the type of joystick they use
YEEERRRREEEESS
THAT THING LOOKS EPIC👌
congratulations  guys its taken so long and im so happy for you guys . One step closer to becoming stark industries in reality
You figure out how to get it to walk and you’ve got a mechwarrior on your hands
OK, how long to make the second one?
When Nerds attack
I don't try to be bad I just want to be fair but, You only did half of that, the rest has already been done by Caterpillar
awesome but would have been so much better with walking legs like in the movie,im sure theres a way this could have been done
Cool as it is, I'm still disappointed at the tracks instead of legs.
You guys actually pulled it off. You absolute legends!
Savage segue into advertisement there.
This is some serious*Lego power miners* level energy
You mad lads finally, really did it! It looks INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! Congrats to the whole team!!
You should upgrade the leaf break with hydraulics my shop did it and it’s so much easier
You guys should continue working on the light sabers to make it better and more travel wise, like smaller more portable without the bigger propane tanks
Mom can we get The HulkBuster? Mom: We have a HulkBuster at home HulkBuster at home:
Oké, most kezdjetek el dolgozni egy igazi alienen :)
Soooo, when does mass production start? LOL.  Also what was budget vs actual cost?  Love the video this just came up for me so it's the first I've seen but might go back and catch a few others.
where do I buy one !!!
We building mechwarrior or gundum style mechs next?
👏👏whoaw it's done!!!!!
What’s next sir?
This machine will kill someone.  Most likely the operator.  Funny signs like " not only will this kill you but it will hurt the whole time" wont be funny when a picked object impales the operator.  Don't get me wrong its cool AF but humans are just squishy little meat sacks and this thing offers very little in the way of protection from basically anything but a roll over.
this is sick. keep up the hard work
This is seriously insane... i work with alot of cat loading equipement... and tbh this thing is like child dream for me xD
Love Princess Auto, everythign you need and even the stuff you don't.
He turned into a monster inside the Power Loader😁
This was supposed to be an aliens power loader.  It's not.  It isn't bipedal.  They took the easy way out and put tracks under it.  Not the same thing.  EPIC FAIL......
Wait it actually has been 3 years Maal I've been there since the beginning 😭😭
I swear, James and I started growing our hair out at the exact same time. I always forget about this channel and revisit after a while, and our hair always looks the exact same
Now you guys can do an APU from The Matrix.
Why destroy a Honda?
That’s pretty neat but can you make it steam punk?
I wonder if the military is actually looking at any of their creations seriously...
Congratulations to the team!👍🏼🎉
Got damn.  Has to weigh so much.  Looks pretty cool.  Maybe we see it in a movie one day. So much work and time spent.  I'm guessing Jeff bozos will want to buy it for his Amazon factories.
We love it!
21:13 that was about more than 23 000 $
you could be a villian in the future but maybe :)) you got deadly weapons Avengers wsas a bad idea
Love you bro, love from India 🇮🇳  Make Doctor octopus arm
Holly shit they literally said fine I'll do it my self
It's perfect for rescue mission
You destroyed a nicer car than you drive...
hey what if you make retractable wolverine claws.
I actually live in Kitchener, first time seeing the Channel  and totally recognized that princess auto
whats better is that if this can be mass produced by CAT, it can change things dramatically.
I was expecting "Get away from her you B-----!!!" Oh well...
Yes.
Guys, I've been following you since the first exoskeleton james made years ago, and always followed ever since, and I love all of your content, but what about making some videos with original inventions you come up with, I mean I love the stuff you recreate from movies but you are a huge crew now and I think you could make amazing stuff that is 100% hacksmith and not copied from a movie, I believe you could make something amazing that could also change the world! Keep it up guys
After so many years of working on this Bogdan is turning into mad scientist in the end xD
wasteful
fantastic result guys well done...
virpil sticks nice xD
I want to see  Sigourney ride it
Space bot
it reminds me of that one guys electric suit from one piece
Make a monowheel please
I mean...its a hybrid but probably more useful than the film one.  I can see how it being bi pedal would probably be dangerous not to mention damaging to floors...
Mr. smith do you have a whole iron man suit cause i told my friends  i have one
Now time to make a titan form titan fall
Amazing
Build another one and joust
shoulda ended with one of the guys coming out like "what the hell did you do to my car?!" lol
The scream at the end
it turned out really nice good job.👍
Finally its completed 🥳🥳🥳
Is that guy super small or is it just scaled way larger?
Have you guys built star lord's rocket boots?
Now we need to set up a mic and voice changer on it so we can sound like optimus prime or megatron and have a battle
Pretty damn cool but I guess giving it proper bipedal locomotion wasn't in the cards.
Suggestion: create odm gear next....?
This is not a power loader. It doesn’t move like the original at all not in form or function.
Does anyone know where I can get some sheet metal?
Hii
Wooooooooooo yay I can't believe it's done!
Test test test test. let's go!
Good job but isn't it supposed walk not roll like a tank???
There is only one allien left for us to make the final assessment.
lol i cant wait until linus hates on their cable management
How much is this
this is the princess auto i go to for work thats neat
I've been here since the first video but the team and building has changed. From a small garage to a  full on business and building
After testing do you plan to let Caterpillar manufacture these for use, or is this just going to lay around the shop like the other prototypes?
I don’t know guys, the original power loader in the Aliens movie didn’t trundle around on treads. It WALKED.
either a loader from borderlands 2, or the mech reagan pilots in the first ep of inside job
In a 1v1 against a Sword your cat lose
Who be disliking this stuff?
Imagine in 30 years when it's normal to see these builds in construction
It needs an additional warning plaque.  “Not to be operated by fuckwits.“
You know what's missing? Am emergency stop 🚨🛑
Imma just cut some wires.. boom its down
If I did my math correct, the studs are overhanging the edge. still got a like. Amazing work.
I'm often Jealous or Envious of YouTube Personalities but I found myself extremly so of Bogdan's trip to Princess Auto.
NOW MAKE IT WALK!
Hi, Honey does nothing. Bye.
Skipped all the way to the end and wasn't impressed.   Wont be returning...
Stage one of mobile suit Gundam 😳😳😳😳😳😳
Wow! Congratulations, I can’t believe you actually built this!
dude... I can't believe a store like that exists!
Wow.
dope
Looks AMAZING! You guys must definetely invite Sigourney Weaver to see it!
bro that was a nice car you destroyed, why dident you destroy that crappy red chrysler
another day, another step closer to tactical dreadnought armor. the emperor protects!
Domo Arigato Archer Roboto !
if only this was military
Don’t need to flex your fame all the time
Somebody has probably put this, but incase nobody has. Somebody needs to build a matrix APU. alla mifune's last stand.
Titanfall 2
Yes, but when is it out for the public? I want to buy one for my son for christmas.
Has it enough counterweight to prevent it from flipping over?
Bay 12, please.
ITS FINALLY DONE!! except for the first 21minutes and 30 seconds of the video😆
Plz made hero gayab mode on  ring
You should put that into production.
In the future you could make a removable mini gun attachment that shoots nerf darts or something similar
next video: "WE MADE A REAL TITAN FROM TITANFALL!"
im terrified if the thing fell over and there is nothing protecting the pilot from sharp objects... O.o BUT! an awesome alien build.
A shipping or construction company might pay big bucks to own one of these, you may have just created a million dollar idea!
“Get away from her you bztch!”
Wow y’all lose this one tbh it needed to walk not drive like my grandma
Awesome bro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Car's Owner: HEY WHAT THE HELL?! I'M CALLING THE COPS!  Bogdan: What are you gonna say? That a gigant yellow robot came and destroyed your car?
You should do power armour from fallout
I wish I had that car.
You guys should use hydraulic socket which  works well.. mainly use on BT model Forklift/Reach truck
Oh how I wish they would build one🙏🙏😅😅
How many years would it take for an actual working Power Armor to finish?
I wonder when they will start building a T-60 Power Armor from the Fallout game?
I have an idea what if you make shredder’s gauntlets from tmnt
CAN YOU MAKE STAR LORD'S ELEMENTAL GUN FROM GUARDIAN OF THE GALAXY
I want that Danger sign!!! ... when's that gonna be on the store???
Well Done! 😎  Hope it will be used more for constructive purpose, than destructive purpose. By the way, where is the bearded multipurpose guy?
Damn 3 yrs man jeez my kid was 2
Man! why are you so obsessed with Power loader, go for some classic shi*. Why are you not making some UFO sort of thing 😂 that would be crazy. 🛸 (UFO) the most underrated piece of scrap👾
21:00 The legendary Bogdan Battle Cry
lol this isnt a power loader its something pretending to be a power loader. Realy tank treads thats not a aliens power loader lol
Destruction is not a solution, but it is simply a CHOICE we would all love to see nect
thats not a powerloader thats a little bulldozer with robot arms.  then you destroy a car someone could have used.  this is peak capitalism.
I literally yelled in triumph when the thing started rolling along. This is incredible.
No leg shield
You should sell the blueprints
It must feel good coming to your job and knowing you have a life-size mech that can lift a car.
Plz plz plz plz make the sword from the movie blade plz
Duel with Eagle Prime...
I'm seriously wondering why these guys don't have a military contract
чувак за кадром: - Моя машина?...
"Army recruiter has joined the chat"
This is just seems like the first development of a Mobile Suits. But with the smaller scale.  -it was from Gundam : advent of the red comet
Congratulations you made a stand up skid steer ……
It's a skidsteer.......
I feel bad for the Xenomorph that are about to DIE....
Ok, now in ready for titanfall
The joysticks look like Xenomorph heads haha
This is your biggest project
Its cool but not the same loader ???
Hi I am a Huge Fan of you I just wanted you to make an Omnitrix FX
Army: Great, now put some armor plates over there, machine gun and missiles in the arms.
They essentially built a f*cking excavator
all thats left is mass production
Can’t wait for like in 50 years time when the hack smiths industries has shut down and some kids just find a whole ass mech in some abandoned building
can you make a power loader test video
Great... Next... AV-98 Ingram
I would have yelled 'UNLIMITED POWER' but the evil laugh is good too.
That squeal lol....Awesome!!
I may have missed it but how much did it end up costing? not including videography and stuff, just actually making it.
its aliiiiive! mad scientist vibes XD
Why is it joystick controlled? Ruined it.
All that is required is ripley 👍
Love seeing this finally come together. It has been a long time coming, what a journey! It looks magnificent.
“Oh my god! It’s happening! Everybody stay calm!!”
Hey If you see this plez make the charge axe from Monster Hunter world it'll be fun and challaging
this is epic
Gotta make it walk!
Kamiakaze power loader
Now do power armor from fallout
Iron Man: Lost Episode
If you decide to give it a name, you should name it "Ripley".
Take some rest, then make some power armor
Make doctor octopus hands
FYI a presidential contender blew his chance screaming like that 21:05
The protective cage should continue down to protect your legs
Shut up and take my money.... Oh who am I kidding, I couldn't afford it in a lifetime.
Time to give hacksmith another Guinness world record
I remember when you started it
These things actually might have some use in the world
I was planning to sleep right now but when i saw this while scrolling, i HAD to watch this
I’m not sure if Bogdan should be able to wield that much power....
17:25 Peeping that Gundam wallpaper!
This is space bot. Not power loader.
what runs ....but does not walk....
Lmao imagine this with Gov't assistance
Bro I live this so much. You guys are creating the future. I'm so glad we have stuff like YouTube engineers that can take time to make there own real innovations and aren't reliant on big CEOs to make what makes money.
"..the steel doesn't look like it was stressed" the steel: plastically deformed
Nice effort, but it doesnt have the legs.
Amazing ! Now make it transform 🤔😂
What an incredible project by an incredible team, with a huge credit to the mad scientist bogdan for working so hard to make this possible
You guys should copyright it and start producing it for the manufacturing and transport industries and military
It's been a great journey.  A lot of movie accuracy had to be sacrificed for practicality, but it still has enough of the important features to give me a huge nostalgia buzz.  I can't wait to watch the rest of that car getting crunched.  Also, thanks for coming together with the community in support of William Osman.
It’s almost the aliens power loader
Ive been watching since they were burning things with mini jet engines and now their finishing the power loader
TIME CARDS!!!!!
The evil in the last few seconds
Oh my god.
who else got Sas: 4 loader bot flashbacks?
Are you guys in china? Why do you have mask on?
Nice Bobcat...
When we gonna see adam savage on the channel ?!
Anyone else think the control stick look like Xenomorph heads?
Protect your legs man
These guys are smart and dumb
that boy has gone bonkers, someone call his dad.
What would have made this perfect, have Sigourney Weaver do the reveal. Slowly open the cargo entrance, and have her roll forward and say, "Get away from her, you bitch!"
Imagine if this thing was at Sema
This needs it's own short film
ITS ABOUT TIME!!!!!
Can you make a version in the future that has the legs?
make an entire gundam now
awesome! now where is Sigourney Weaver?
its a forklift...
Everybody remember to do time cards! TIME CARDS!!!
When will you announce the winner of the newest giveaway?
and this is a give away
i just want to see him load and unload some trucks with it.
What no Reeboks to go with it?
You scare me.
Power loader do a flip
Not sure why you ruined a new car but eh...
To bad you couldn't get a two legged one
this project made me realise how impossible the iron man suit is
Bastards! That was a Honda Element you destroyed!
It's a mind-blowing achievement, a history you made.   You are now an immortal through your work.   Your mortal body can pass out but your work will remain forever.       I'm happy that it happened in my presence. Although I have little no contribution to it, I watch this become a dream into reality.

Este vídeo me ensinou uma coisa muito importante, a dividir tarefas para cumpri-las organizadamente. Tão ver esse esforço de todos para construir isso. Ele so quebrou as janelas, devia ter levantado o carro também!
I'm just a casual follower of the channel, but low key sad the dude who started this build doesn't seem to be involved anymore? Makes it a little less special IMO.
What was that glue coming out of the hot glue gun.
So what is this designed to load?Ever heard of a forklift?It's not nearly as slow and you can sit instead of standing up.I guess it's cool it's something new.
Hydraulics is nice but the elbows might be big electric stepper motors , like the KUKA ABB robots have. That would be much faster not to mention range of motion. Not sure how much power do they need to run.
Plz test winter soldier arm
so my question is why do most mechs I see use treads or wheals of some kind instead of a "normal" pair of legs. Is there a reason behind it or is it just convenience?
I completely understand how he feels. This has been a long and stressful project. It feels good to finally see the thing live up to all those high expectations.
it doesnt walk.....its not a power loader
ok its great and all, but 1 word: legs.
Could you make a bomb for a video
Princess Auto is the best!
Now some company will pay them to use it as a movie prop and they'll make all their money back. Best investment ever.
o dude wheres my car?
Wow a giant pinching machine
Make a Titan from Titan fall next
Duuuude I have a waiting for this for so long! Great job guys! Now make the Reptar wagon! Lol
this is the issue I have with this channel they show maybe 20 seconds of the thing at the end then come out with a bloated video of the thing doing stuff a week later like come on we dont need a 20 min video of the thing doing things just like 5-8 mins at the end of the completion video. Stop milking content.
17:27 as a fellow welder i had to laugh a little bit just from thinking about all the ridiculous positions ive had to twist my body into to be able to reach the joint lol
The effort you guys put into this thing is honestly unimaginable. Good job.
I like how the joysticks look like little Xenomorph heads
Bogdan with facial hair?!?
The robot has virpil sticks poggers.
Insane! WOOOOW! Absolute fantastic work!!!!! Next project: The Sulaco? The dropship with amored personel carrier? You decide :D,  i love your work! Nicely done!
Now when do these become commercially available?
lol did we just create a new villain?
Now that it's done the military is gonna buy the blueprints 100%
I mean not.all 12m where following along bro. I wasn't I've just watched this one. Probably won't watch it the whole way through.
A real prawn soot from subnautica
It is beautiful. This is an amazing achievement.
I’d like to actually see it do some work
isn't the power loader supposed to have LEGS?
Why not tear down a hoverboard and us the gyroscope to self level? Feet!
Lets go brandon
Why the tracks?🤔
All fine an dandy an great work on it but the one in the movie was not on a tank track system
One cannot ride this without yelling “get away from her you bitch”.
Great. Now build me a Cheyenne dropship. Actual size. Fully functional. Oooh, and an APC.   The hell with it: you might as well throw in a 1:1 scale SULACO. In orbit.  You still here? Get to work!
you guys need to invite sigourny weaver to come see it !!!
Princess auto is the best
I thought those existed since the making of Aliens
THIS IS CRAZY!!! I LOVED WATCHING THIS THING GET BUILT!
That one scene from Inside Job where Raegan told everyone to enter thier Time Cards!
This is awesome. But no legs. Nope. No dice. Just kidding. To me the legs would be a major balancing hazard. Awesome work Guys. !
Next robot a AT ST
Make a  gundam next!
The thumbnail Don't forget to do timecards!!
Great work guys looks awesome!!
Why do you wear masks at work? Are you obliged by law to do this? If not please stop because we're really sick of seeing people wearing masks everywhere.
Why did you have to kill a Honda?????
This gives me old school mythbuster vibes
Y las piernas????? Bien igual muchachos
Can I borrow this to move a pole position arcade game?
So when can I put in a order for one???? lol
I'm not hating. This is an incredible, work of art, where art imitates life!. Amazing!!!!
Good Job
Йоу , чел, случаем не знаешь, возможно ли сделать Гаусс пушку из Сталкера? Man, you don’t know if it’s possible to create a Gauss rifle from the Stalker
SPACE BOT
And it only took 40 years!! Yay technology!!!!!!!!
So, can you please now make power armor from fallout?
This thing won't be complete until Sigourney stacks some boxes with it.
It's the robot from alien
love your vids can you make more iron man and batman
He turned suddenly in evil person when it's completed, ready to destroy stuff...
Hope u guys can make a real gundam cuz that must be daammnn cool
When he was talking to the cashier I felt that.
OK, this is cool, It´s sad I did not discover it more early. I also would love to see a follow Up video if someone is actually buying the rights from you to actually manufacture this beasts!
20:56 with the self destruct button on the back, doofenshmirtz will be so proud
Can you make god of war blades of chaos
Impressive,  most impressive
The early stages of the gundam lol
I really hope I can see this in a movie background or something, someone in holly wood show of this incredible work of art. Even better if it shows up in an alien movie, fingers crossed
You guys should make a b1 battle droid
Ok hell yeah
It would be nice if it actually walked rather than just rolled oh and the hands rotate full 360 degrees, as this just technology assembled in a different way.  Also it will only be fair to have one of the women doing the initial final driving of it and using it on something as big as the queen xenomorph and using the ever famous line.  Get away from her you Bitch! And the scream of the queen in the background
Looks like the mech from the Infiltration Overwatch cinematic
Lol DANGER not only will this kill you it will hurt the whole time your dying.
k so how much for you guys to make me one :D
You didn't say the thing
The robot is well protected but not the driver.
You simply cannot make something like that and not say one of the best lines in sci-fi history.   Even if you have to beep.
How about MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM next 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Can you make a black panther suit that has a really strong magnet in it so u can walk on metal walls
I think it would be awesome for you to try to make Power Armor from the Fallout games.
Do you think maybe someone could convince Sigourney Weaver to show up for the finale and take it for a spin :)
I grinded like 20 hours for a little robotic arm, and that is nothing compared to your project...
Why do I have the image of the rest of the crew listening to Bogdan's maniacal laugh and looking at each other saying "What have we done?"
Can you try to make a destroyer
Built a stealth Jet fighter please!!! 🦾💀
You should give the schematics to CAT so they can mass produce these Mainly because I want to own one
Is it allowed on drive thru?
„You did it! You crazy son of a bitch, you did it“
What store did you go to?
Note to self: Don't park the car close to Hacksmith Industries.
Just don't answer the phone when the Chinese military calls.  They want 1 mil units in short order.  1/2 scale!!!
Wonder if the choice on those joysticks was intentional being how they kind of resemble the alien
Congrats guys, this is so awesome! When can I place my order ;)
Can your please do another games bond give away
Hacksmith industries, could try and build a sleigh with tracks and different attachments.
those 1.3K dislikers are probably xenomorphs in disguise or the owner of the car
Are you going to have a Xenomorph pop out now? lol
Please make fast speed for arm
It's time to powerload the Eiffel Tower
only good on level ground  ............
Now, you absolutely must create a xenomorph to see the reenactment of the battle. and if it's not too much to ask ... could rippley pilot the power loader? please!!!
Kitu we hungkul ,, dasar
Now we can kill those Xenomorphs or people who don’t do their damn time cards!
After all those years
were is a leg?
20:57 if you see it toooooooo....
Evil laught at ending, scare me 😱
Im just waiting to see you guys get a military contract fkr that thing. Its so badass!!
Wow has it really been three years? Great work
Looks like you might lose some legs around the knee area if ur not careful
14:04 THE CHAINS INS THE BACKROUND LINE UP
Now put two machine guns on it instead of chomper arms
Its weird to finally see it finished. Im kinda used to the episodes
Now all they need to do is mass produce them
This machine should be forbidden!! ;) That was a long project guys insane! Congrats
Watch out Weyland mite come after ya for a contract. Building better worlds
who the hel is this goverment cut out! where is the real one!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Oof
This is so cool! I feel like that thing can easily lift that honda up no problem
Great! Now all we need is a real life Heisenberg, like literally just get a bunch of Heisenberg's to scale and run em' over
I was like in middle school when I first saw the Hacksmith and seen all these crazy inventions and irl movie props, but the power loader was a journey, now im almost halfway through my Joiner year and it’s finally done. I cant wait to see the  demolition clips. Also cant wait to see whats that next big project!   Go Hacksmith Industries!!!
Please invite Hugh Jackman to promote REAL STEEL 2 if the movie is still really going to happen... Great work and dedication...
that laugh at the end... resonates very well with my geeky soul
This channel is what you get when silver spoon trust fund kids don’t have anything better to do with their money.
That was a test car, I hope?
You guys surely have a drill press, right? Why drill through that thick of steel work a battery unit? Hell, at least break out the Hilti
sheesh
can you guys make BT 7274 from titanfall2 next?
That thing just looks so mean.  I've only been waiting 3 years for this reveal. :)
a well deserved break is in order for something like this
What next power armor from fallout wait... hehe:)
do scissor seven's sword or scissor
But. The one in the movie had actual legs not caterpillar tracks.
I feel so amazing and proud for having been  able to see this from the starts. Congratulations to all of you at hacksmith for making it real haha
Hey you guys from the hacksmith I want to see one of you do the weapons welded by the batman villain condiment king
21:06 sounds like someone getting their ass violated lol
Cool, cool. Now give it *weapons*
This is bad, ITS BAD BC THIS IS THE LAST OF THEM SHOWING IT BC THERE DONE
super cool！
It's beautiful
Been here since the cap shield bruh I remember the day y’all started the power loader gawdam
destroyed a honda element, a sought after discontinued car :(
It’s on tracks…
i think  they will also make jeagers from pacific rim in the future. Hope so
who wanna bet he sells these
Kitty Litter absorbent? really? there are many better, more effective products out there.
Can you do and a electrified samurai sword pls i love your vids i subscribe my grandmother past away
Demonstration is in the next video then? That would have been nice to know up front.
You guys took forever to complete this project and that's not a complaint because you took the time to do it right and make sure everything was safe and it came out awesome
Hyperius
Gonna need more of that steel mesh to protect the operator from becoming impaled on a piece of steel or flying objects while in use
After all these years chords hydraulics the system electric wires and it comes up all to this😢.
To think this thing could have a legitimate use in construction scares me  Edit: yes I know it’s built on the chassis of a construction vehicle, but you can use the arms for crane work
I have been subscribed for years. This is my first time seeing this project.
Looks amazing! Can’t wait to see what happens with this next!
Looks sick guys
Where's the legs?
those VPC Constellation alpha sticks look great on this tbh
Now armorize and weaponnise!
The future is near.
@Amazon 👀 will you be using this?
this just proves that it is possible with current tech and that they should develop this further
I’ve been on this journey with you guys since it started I’m so glad it’s finished
The Aliens power loader was bipedal not on tracks
Borderlands anyone?
Bogdan gone rogue? That man is crazy…
Man where’s the drink holders?
Not gonna lie I loved this whole project. When can I drive it jk
👀I would want some kind of protection in the roll cage. If an object finds it's way to the operator, they have nowhere to go.😱
Bloody nice 👍
Still fail.... it doesn't walk, it crawls. :D
We are getting closer to the omnissiah!!
This may be from Alien... but the SCV vibes are real here!
Tip of the hat! That's a lot of work!
Where are the legs? You just made the arms not the whole power loader.
Now to build space marine armour.
Can you guys do a Goliath from call of duty
They finally finished it! Great job can’t wait till you make Optimus prime!
You guys should make a real life proton pack from the movie ghostbusters
Finally borderlands 2 comes to life
Now watch it go into mass production
I waited so long for that
EVERYONE REMEMBER TO DO TIME CARDS! TIME CAAAAAAARDS!!!!!
you need Sigourney Weaver to try it
5:54 when you get two things from walgreens
Quick question does honey work for the dark web
thats pretty cool, now do tords giant robot.
I’m sorry……it’s not a Power Loader. I understand how much work went into this but at the core, it’s just some arms mounted to a skid steer.
Great that it's done but a bit more footage of working would be a better teser not "tune in to another video to see it in action", fantastic design work and mods, you can design in cad and spin things round in 3d world but when your physically next to it to see what improvements can be done. The cries of satisfaction was chilling its like hulk smash. One good mod for future videos would be interchangeable arm ends like flame thrower or a gataling gun projectile, destruction is only limited by imagination 👍👍👍
i have to admit, the hacksmith inc. black card looks dam dope
b ra
How can you create a series with seasons and episodes on YouTube just like on this video?
holy shit, they did it. They actually did it. I've been watching this project for years now but wow. To see it actually done?
bolt or screw on the gripper grips. do not just use glue for that part.
So do you already have orders from Caterpillar for more?
I literally watched aliens last night then this popped up!
Stand by for titanfa-
YESSSSSSS!!! IT'S DONE! I'M SO HAPPY!!
you guys should do a collab with the thought emporium, you build the alien props, he genetically engineers the alien. A perfect match if you ask me.
I like the To Do list where it says Gripper needs grip
please tell me your going to patent this to a construction vehicle company or hell even the armed forces our men and woment out there and on bases and airforce bases can use somthing like this
MAKE FALLOUT POWER ARMOR
I haven’t watched a hack smith video ever since the real lightsaber, youtube just kinda started not recommending me the videos anymore and I forgot, so seeing this done without having to wait knowing it’s being made is pretty much the only benefit
SCV good go!
I really hope Cats will order a couple of those from them as publicity stunts. Those guys deserve more work and money!! Awesome.
Incredible. I didn't want to say anything while you were working, but I honestly expected this to be a project where you get halfway through and realize the full project is unfeasible, or more likely that it would be financially impractical. I've seen so many awesome projects end up like that on YouTube, I just assumed that's how these things go.  But then y'all went and actually did it. Incredible.
why didn’t you do the reveal of the finished product with a garage door coming up, like in the movie?
Oh no.  You guys use Trello. I can't stand Trello.
Isn't that the robot from the hammer dude of the stories with tmnt?
now thats worth a sub! Very very cool.
WHY A HONDA ELEMENT THOSE ARE SO HARD TO FIND
Next video: *takes it to it’s limits* The power loader: *Breaks*
the main question, do you think this is something that could be refined into a functional product?
Nice job, but who cares?
Haha im literally watching this sitting in my honda element 😂 i looked to my left thinking He was gonna kill me 💀 ive been waiting for years and i can’t believe its finally finished! Incredible!   In the future maybe you guys can make detachable attachments for the arm for different uses like for example  the teeth on the claws, you can detach  the teeth and attach forlift spikes or whatever they’re called, iron man repulser cannons, spinning blades like General Grievous, catapult arms, you get the idea. Detachable arms for even cooler things.
Transferring controls to pilot. It is good to have you back pilot, we work well as a team
I watch these videos to remind me why i am an engineering major, life after college can be far more interesting.
What kinda real world applications do you have in mind for the power loader, it's probably from a movie I  havne't seen or something so. I assume construction or maybe moving large or heavy materials around the shop. Side note, have you ever given thought about building R2D2? Just curious
Drives through glass “this thing is soo powerful hahah”
What did that thing cost to build?
Awesome build
Where is the hacksmith? We want to see him during test and making
Does anyone else mistake the Hacksmith Logo in the comments for a clone trooper helmet?
They technically made a new powerloader in only one video
I can only begin to imagine the dopamine rush when he first climbed into it.
Can you guys make a series to building the apex heirlooms as accurate as possible to the game but also put your own hacksmith twist on it?
Love the hardline tubing. looks so clean. great work bogden and the everyone who worked behind the scenes. amazing vid!
I'm so excited after following the series since it started
Yeah i said i dislike the treads, but that cant take away the fact that the overall product is incredible and yall are way smarter than me, just overall claps all around for the amazing work.
Ahh... I would love to work for you guys someday
You should make the whirligig saw from bloodborne 🙌🙌
Nobody:  Hacksmith every single video: _Good day, Gentlemen. I am here to change the future._
If that was my car, I'd be like "get away from her you BITCH!"
Now that it's built, it's already being copied in China and being sold by Kioti Tractor.
Now make the APC!
That cashier didn't care what they were building lol. Just tryna make it through another 8 hour shift.
Wow, constellation alphas for the joysticks? I guess they're a relatively minor cost in the scope of this build though.
Hacksmith you should really sell the power loader! It would make you billionaire.💵💰💴💸
I only build motorcycles. Not power loaders. Anyway. Final assembly is always my favorite. Love it.
Wdym make it look like the real thing, this is the real thing
Ok. I have to admit I'm truly impressed, but this just doesn't feel like a hacksmiths' project to me. I mean, it looks amazing, so if the details are phenomenal, but I'm not convinced it is heavy enough..... I saw people picking up panels by themselves!!!  What an incredible piece of work. Thank you!
I loved watching you guys progress to achieve your dream project
5:38 that lady 100% didnt believe you
I need this nice joystick. from where you have it?
Yes now build a titan from titanfall
After so long, it’s complete
This thing looks awesome! Been following along with each update since the original video. Only question for you guys is would it not be a good idea to have some sort of plate metal over tubing enclosure to better protect the operator of the power loader? I notice that your whole body is exposed and arms were very close to the powerloader arms. Another reason I ask is would your legs not be crushed if you were to lift something in the loader higher then the base and the hydraulics failed?
i dont think the real powerloader had tracks.
Is that wall.e 2000
That hardline upgrade is super slick looking. Great work HSI
Does Segourney Weaver know you guys are done, and is she going to get to drive it?
This power loader is cooler than Strong Arm Machine from Jetpack Joyride game
I remember sitting in school in an uncomfy chair watching the start of this. My teacher came up behind me and said "What are you doing?" because I wasn't supposed to be on a computer as it was a woodworking class. He let me finish the video.
Guys, please build a kickass bot to participate in Battlebots !
Next you shall build a fully functional Space Suit
The Hacksmith card just screams, “Hi I work for Stark Industries.” 😂
I remember the original had a cat logo as well cool man
When I graduate from college with an mechial master engineering degree I want to join this team in Canada, maybe space X too
Der Flammenwerfer?
Ok next do a transformer that can turn in to a  car
Sigourney weaver would be proud to see her baby working. You guys are awesome.
Is it just me or does bogdan look like Peter Parker
And the one smart kid during show And tell
Wow 3 yrs of work so cool
If you guys could build like 10 of these a year I'm sure y'all would be billionaires by selling all of these power loaders to construction companies around the planet.
I’ve been waiting 15 episodes and it’s GLORIOUS:0.can’t wait for the test😄
just make sure you say the line i dont care if it has to be beeped out but you gotta do the line from the movie
Dude walks out of the shop "WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY CAR"
You guys are the definition of the future
Build power loader ✅ Grab Honda Element✅. Emit horrifically girlish scream✅
For the Algorithm
* cries in Na’vi
make a minecraft shulker box
I could hear YEARS of pent up frustration leaving Bogdan's body when he roared towards that car!
Can you make a working legend of zelda link's grappling hook
So we're just not gonna talk about how the joysticks look like Xenomorphs?
So exactly how much yellow paint did you guys use? lmao
they should make the terra blade from terraria useing a laser
Wow its finally done! Congrats
NOOOOOO NOT THE ELEMENT
I think we can all aggre. That there a real life stark enterprise
pls make the ecto1
Nice
Ah I remember when this project first started it has been so long now the journey is complete
that is so cool well down for making it
bro this only has a million views!? you made a friggin robot suit!
bruh, I remember when Bogdan used to do tiny projects but look at him now
I wonder what would Michael Reeves do with this if he had it. Maybe he would give it a toilet
This stopped being a power loaderwhen the tank treads went on
This is breathtakingly awesome
Now make a Prawn Suit
O so off topic request, you ever watch young justice? Could you recreate their suits, specifically kid flashes with the way he taps the symbol and it goes to stealth
just had to leave on a cliff hanger and milk the series for all its worth eh? this is why I stopped watching your content
Invite Sigourney Weaver to demonstrate this monster! 😁😁😁
Wow... Actually jaw dropping. I remember a few years ago I wasn't sure if I liked this channel. Their projects seemed kinda overstated and not nearly as cool as the title made them sound. now though bruh they made a real friggen power loader
I know it’s better and more efficient with the tracks on it, but I was raised on aliens and it just doesn’t look right without the legs.
Damn this is just epic. Can't believe it has already been 3 years since this project started. You guys have done a great job here!! Hyped for the testing video
"TIME CARDS!!!" -Reagan
This is a mech suit. No this is amazing.
88 on welding helmets!!!!! Not cool losers.
"Ah finally my own mech suit" - Somebody That I Used To Know
It’d be cool to see you guys make something like working hulk buster armor in the future or maybe something similar to a mantis mech from halo
I would destroy that thing with a bone stock skid steer
Imagine if company’s started manufacturing these and they made billions dollars of of blue prints and stuff
I feel like this is the type of thing that’s really cool but the army or something is like yeah we’re just gonna take this and make it a military version that’s basically a tank :D
So did Bogdan get the Cashier's digit's?
I was with you right up until you went after the Element. Why you got to kill a Toaster. 😢
Bro I swear I need one y'all to walk to it in the dark while it's glowing start it up and say "it's ALIVE they called me crazy but not anymore" scream it to 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That danger sign is beautiful
The more I look at it, the less it is a power loader, and the more it is an arm attachment on a forklift :/
Wow, so when's winston studio's swinging by to check it out?
no shot its been 3 years
Friend: Prawn suits from subnautica won't ever exist  Me: link to this video
It'd be cool to see you guys build Lancer from Mech arena: Robot Showdown
You need Ripley to take it for a spin!!😂
Great job. I haven’t watched it yet, so it’s ten times cooler.
can you make a real life size bat signal?
Бодя, красава 😢 И вся команда - красавцы😢 Сделать такого меха - это охуеть как круто. Ну чтож, далее трансформер, а там и до Евангелионов недалеко.
Not only will this Kill you, It WILL hurt the whole time you are dying... wow nice dark touch there on the DANGER sign guys XD lolz.
MASSIVE CONGRATULATIONS !!!
i swear they better say the line
Make a robot hand control
Finally! Can't wait to see it in action.
Or the whole stealth suit
One question do you think that a cow could possibly drive it
You guys should try to make real life working Ghostbusters gear
Describes power loader to clerk while wearing picture of the power loader. Now that is what I call double redundancy!
Isn't it supposed to walk?
Sheesh
This is not the end only the beggineng bogdon says
1000% hoping Sigourney is in the last episode.....
This is absolutely insane, definitely one of the biggest projects they've worked on!
You should paint it red to make it faster, as it is it will just explode with more power.
Im building one rn fuck that!
That evil laugh tho…
I love all your work Hacksmith eng team!!! Awesome work with everything! Subbed!!
You guys are literally Star labs from the show Arrow
did james heal we NEED the winter solider video part 2
I want one. i dont know what ill do with it, but give it to me and ill find a use
"EVERYONE REMEMBER TO DO TIME CARDS!" " *TIME CARDS!* "
Want to see a video where you show it to all the guys who sponsored this build and maybe even get some engineers from CAT comment on your design
I like that the joysticks kind of look like little xenomorphs.
It’s done! CAT international: “this is property of the Capitular corporation, thanks for doing our R&D”
My boy trying to flirt with the cashier was gold
My mind blew up I can’t believe you’re not a hold are you doing how long how are you doing like that a whole is done
Now I need a updated "Shake hands with danger" video from CAT
useless
They need to make power armor from fallout
That’s super cool I have an idea I wish you could do but I don’t want to really give out my ideas yet and it would be dumb to create a kids design for a YouTube channel that has OVER 12 MILLION SUBS
Mask when painting?
Ребята, вы очень, долго тяните резину с этим экскаватором!
Even though it's from Alien Anthology it's looks like the thing Sanji fought in One Piece lmao
Damn
Im a tiny bit afraid that Bogdan has gone a tiny bit mad from all this. In a good way of course.
Bogdan is stuggling to explain the power loader to the cashier, but he is literally wearing a T shirt with a picture of it.
Top half maybe but the bottom half’s nothing like it 👍
It's looks like a machine in an inside job series.
I remember watching the first video the day it came out. Now to see it done is amazing. Im so proud of everyone who worked on it. :)
how...just how did humans ever create something like this!!!
my god 3 years
Did you put proportional valves on the right arm? If you did, I missed it.
Get away from her you bitch!   Nice job guys 😎
Awesome
so crazy u guys actually finished what a fun project to watch over the years thank you🙏🏼
They overestimated how much time humanity would need to build a power loader.
Bro the military probably takes notes on every video you post
now attach multiple lightsabers
now can you weponise it? you could make super high powered lightsaber/ wolverine claws a predator style sholder cannon and your predetor helmet for targeting laser cannons for goodness sake  hell you can make your own live action titanfall movie with that thing!!!
Looks like something from fallout 4
Have you invited Sigourney Weaver to come by for a test drive?
Epic
8:14 In Canada, the heavy machinery reversing warning beepers are polite.
Can you make yandoos flying arrow
As soon as he fired that thing up, he went crazy with power. Straight up mental, going at that car.
This channel has terned into more of his employees than the actual hack smith
risk of rain arg when
Hope you pattened it ! Someone might actually wanna buy that !!!!!!
They goin' to bigger and bigger things, keep it up guys!
This is so sick, You guys should recreat the scene from Aliens!
If anyone wants to take over the world contact this guy😆
3 whole years for a masterpiece.
power loader is done so  you guys should make power armor from fallout 4 pls
For these interns, the experience is almost immeasurable but I cant help but think about how much of this is on their backs.
Make doc ocks tentacles!!
It would be cool to see these things in actual construction sites, they look like they could be helpful but probably bulky to transport.
Wait holy s*** it's actually done. It's been a year or two and HOLY crap its finished
Id love to see this actually used to help build homes for the disenfranchised, or help in rescue and rebuild efforts or safe demolition. I mean, its fully functional.
3 And  A Half Years Later, It Is Done
Handsome Jack Approves
I felt that scream in my chest😅
After they test this they should make a Monsters Inc door shredder
clicked on this video thinking it was done then watched 20 minutes of this neek assembling shit until finally it was done, bare misleading
I bet that this man can Create A Interdemensional Gap in this universe
Next stop, Gundam
Love the powerloader and all but isn't the ones in Aliens walkable as opposed to being drivable?
If I was CAT I’d be jumping all over this.
Its taken 3 years but you finnally finished it nice job guys
Omg this thing is so awesome I would love to see a video of you trying to enter a battle bots tournament or make one of your own
I can’t believe It’s already been 3 years
The beast has awoken...
It's that thing from inside job
Too think I live an hour away from this amazing mech...
The receipt looks like 3 items at CVS
Need plexiglass sheilding for your face! and maybe things to protect your legs!
Man that was a good Honda Element. Couldn’t smash something more junkie?
Cool. Now make MJOLNIR (not the hammer, the armor)
It is done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you make some kind of mind control / telekinesis technology where you can move stuff with your mind?
GYPSY AVENGER 1.0 😁😁
Inside Job fans I see
All I"m gonna say is you better have Sigourney Weaver driving that thing in the finale episode.
Finally. An Aliens power loader project has been completed. It looks even more awesome than I could have possibly imagined.
You guys are duplicates of hafestus(I think that’s how you spell his name)
SCV good to the go, SIR!
So, B.R.U.T.E now?
It is done ya after 3 years
they should get sigourney weavee to reenact some scenes with this bad boy
Hey!! Great job! :D
that nice girl at the store printed you a new scarf :D
Are you going to invite Segurny Weaver over for a test drive? It would be awesome to see her expression.
YouTube didn’t send me a notification or recommend me this video so I’m two days late :(
When can I rent one of these at home Depot? I got tiles to unload and bring into the site on the second floor
next season of battle bots be like
Anybody else notice how the joysticks not only look like xenomorphs, but have the same black/green color scheme?
Finale coming 2023
I can't wait till the finale when you get to the legs!
Great now all we need are Xenomorphs
That scream at the end, god help whoever he’s with if he sounds like that when he orgasms
Mack a keytar sword
YES FINALLY!!!!!!
i’ve watched since the 100$ diy spider name costume vid  love y’all and it’s great to see this done
this gives me maaaad "canadian killdozer" vibes
One of many projects that will prove useful around the shop while also being, without a doubt, the coolest thing you've built so far. Who knows, maybe they might want to use it in a future Alien's film if they were to make one.
Can you make the young wolves howl from destiny
that store was awesome. i wish there was one in AZ. i could get lost walking around in there for hours
Power loader, yes. Alien power loader, no.
Cashier: How many hydrologic fittings do you need?  J: Yes.
Do you think in honour of the new movie, you guys could make a ghostbusters proton pack?
these Pandora blue cats need to be prepared for what is to come!
This is an incredible build, you guys did an amazing job on this Power Loader!
Gotta milk every single cent this bad boy can make.
I hope that wasn't James's car 🤣
21:04 my grandparents have that same car...
Ah, that roar Bogdan let out when he pierced that car... That was _so_ many things. Satisfaction, cathartic release at this project's _many,_ *_many_* frustrations, a _huge_ part surprise and awe at the _sheer _*_magnitude_* of the achievement and project in and of itself...  Rock on man, rock on...
where can i buy it
You finally did it! That's awesome!
Awesome work! Now that the loader is done, you could transition in to a full suit of Fallout 4/76 Power Armor with the techniques used here. I would love to see it complete to similar spec.
I know where I'm going if there is ever a zombie apocalypse
I wanna see y'all make a living moving symbiote
I only now realised Hacksmith doesn't have an overhead crane in the workshop. I bet if they were planning/designing the workshop now, they would include one.
Dude I've been there since the start. This project is so incredible, it's amazing to see it actually finished. I really hope it's not just torn down for parts, but I also don't know how much use it would be...
who else remembers when it was just james throwing baterangs at shit? this channel has come so far! so cool to see the beast finally completed.
I had my doubts about the tracks but... all things said and done and more importantly, obstacles overcome. I am impressed :) But, I hope this gets the attention of Boston Dynamics.. because I really think between both companies, you could do an unmodified one that would self stabilize in a slightly smaller scale.  GREAT WORK!!!!!!
forklift chicken for maximum luck.
You guys should build Spider-Man’s drone the cones off his suit
Brio who’s car is that
Boggy pulling those chicks from the check out counter
Try to make a titan from titanfall2
Now I feel like they gonna buy the prints and mass produce these
In year 2042 Hacksmith would be mass producing these Power Loaders massively
Geez I would of liked to have that car you just ruined...
Hi! Can you guys make the iron man briefcase suit from the iron man 2
So, now that you've finally got an operational Power Loader, when would you use a Power Loader over conventional equipment?
Turck cables for electrical disconnects.
You should make a version of this more suited for construction and demolition work and sell the design to companies
Can you make a life size beyblade?
The arm limbs were too small of any dexterity with that huge 'Johny-5' chain belt wheels that came from skinning the CAT. Using its slow motion gears, its an extremely low agility mech, verse many modern invented, construction devices.
I think the next Major project should be a mech from Just Cause 3
What if they made more of these and sold them it would be awesome for other people
Stronk
Hey hacksmith try doing doctor octopus tentacle  bet it takes 5 months
It looks like the trailer for titanfall 3 Its amazing
The science part of that evolution is wrong, can monkeys build house from iron and cement. Can the speak the human language, NO!!
I love that the joy sticks are alien heads
Now make a fallout power armor, i dare you
you can build a real Halo armor MK2 from the master chif
Now we just need a giant alien from space to fight this mech suit
How long would it take to make this if all the team worked on it non stop for like 3 days?
Bad ass! Awesome job. Now you need a h.u.d. or helmet for the operator.
Bro next make a Titan
It's a good looking Power Loader. Damn that thing is HEAVY. The hydraulics is pretty damn smooth. Nice job guys.
And now let Sigourney Weaver test drive this....
Wow. Hacksmith really went to tiktok huh. God, this used to be a good channel and now they instantly ruined it.
You guys should make a reql working ark star from apex legends
You did it , you son of a bitch you did it !!!
Next project: Make It Real: Panzerkamphwagen VIII Maus Tank
"Everyone remember to do your time cards, TIME CARDS !"
Hell yeah! Finally it is ✅ finished! Let's destroy the Xenomorph!
I see you with those joysticks looking like the xenomorph :)
This has to by far be the most insane thing y'all have ever built! And being able to see (a fraction) of the process of how it was made makes this all the more satisfying!
Space Bot
Now do the one from Pacific Rim
It's not done until it's bi-pedal.
This is so exciting!! This project is absolutely amazing. The level of craftsmanship and engineering you showed along the way is really, really inspiring.
Literally cannot wait to see this bad boy in action!!! You guys are effin amazing!!!
From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it _disgusted_ me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine.  Your kind cling to your flesh, as if it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass that you call a temple will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am *already* saved, for the Machine is _immortal…_
Use the power loader to build another power loader.
Now all you need is to get an alien from space and test if it can kill it
Lmaoo seeing you shop in the same princess auto as me is a trip! Love to see it!
When do I get to ride it lol. Seriously though, this is amazing
I was in that store like 2 days ago lol
I worked on Tanks and Tracks in the Army for many years. I always loved the feeling of power driving them around on road tests and while operating the M88a1s. But this thing just looks completely unsafe and savagely fun at the same time. Now make a battlemech and beat Japan to it.
I have an idea you guy should make a watch that has an inbuilt 360 degree hidden camera y u may ask this because many people are blamed for harrasment and rape and many are victim of it and they could use the evidence from this watch that they could wear through out  the day this would do a lot of good in the current world I hope u guys will actually do make it or somthing with the same purpose but more convenient and hidden
Love your work guys.
They actually could use that type of setup.
One day X Æ A-12's great great grandson is gonna want this for his 140th birthday.
Have been watcing the Hacksmith since he moved into the previous garage/shop when the team was james ian and a few more. watching them now with a full workforce makes me immencely proud
I remember when you guys started this project and I watched the first video right when it came out please keep doing these AMAZING projects
You should make another one so they can battle
You should get some girls on your team man
One day they will make an army and take over the world
You should’ve put a cup holder in it.
When can I get one?
Let's hope Bogdans laugh was an upgrade to Chaotic good and not the beginning of his transformation to Dr. Octopus!! Awesome work guys! You'll be gazillionaires with commercial crossover!!
It's about time. 😄
See you're telling me it took you 2 years to make the power loader
They made a power loader and the first thought was to attack a car with it
You miss pronounced vinyl when you said said leather. I would of accepted Pleather though
OH MY GODNESS!!!
Most ambitious completed project on the channel and it looks absolutely phenomenal great work guys!
Well the crates of aliens know who to contact for another movie
That's the future!
From one crushy claw to a monster machine.  Loved this project, can't wait to see it's mental crushing capacities
Ultimate
So now we are gonna need to wait 4 months to see what it can finally do
I feel soon companies will be mass producing these for constructional purposes and stuff like that
Ridley Scott would approve
emmet from the lego movie be like
Sorry, but it's not "done" until it walks :)
im leaving my mark here
amazing
Still curious what the response is going to be from the CAT Engineers and Executives
12:40 please tell me you didn’t leave Tack Welds…
I’m so proud of you James!!
I give all the mechanical work A+.  Quality of the welds around a C+.  Cuz as a welder that’s all I notice when watching this video
Make omnitrix 🔥 I know it is not possible but you can try!!
Been here since the batman grappling thingy
Buddy’s trying to hit on the cashier with the mech
Now lets make some mobile suit next?
Can’t wait to see what happens when they break this out at fairs and engineering competitions…
a very expensive toy, and not much more, gj dipshits
Wow. I’m speechless lol- this is amazing
Now we just need the biologists to create an alien xenomorph queen to fight with this thing.
20:11  Is it just me or did you just realize that the top of the joy-sticks looks like an alien head?
Man did this almost entire episode himself but drives a sh*t box damn
Was the car that y’all smash from the scrap?
How about you make a hawkeye'bow
Hack smith, I’ve been watching since the beginning, it’s been a journey👍🏼🔥
I hope James Cameron watches this!!!
3 years!? who els has been watching from the start and didn’t think it wasn’t all that long ago
i love the choise of joystick you used in my opinion those are one of the best on the market
I finally watched the Aliens movies a few months ago because of this ongoing project and it made me realize that the only reason why (in the movie) they need the power loaders is to counteract the artificial gravity induced in the loading bay of their big ship that is always in space. Why didn’t they just shut off the artificial gravity in there whenever they needed to move cargo and just float it all to the right spot? Somebody please tell me that’s not a big plot hole!
That really came out great! Plenty of destruction lies ahead. LOL
epic
Imagine you wake up in the morning and see a guy with a transformer laughing after he destroys your car
bogton didn't bend the hydraulic distribution blocks cover all the way at the top where the holes were drilled. insted of bending it more he has the welder clamp the gap together. Thats why at 12:51 the top is bowed out. the sides are being held in by the welds but the middle isn't so it bowed out!!!! I'm surprised you didn't have the other plate to check as a reference while you were on the brake.
*now recreate this full scale out of Lego's for the perfect trifecta of geeky awesomeness and a gold star for exceptional cleverness*    *do it for the children*
Dune shields?
stonks
This has been a long run. I love the manic ending! Now we get to watch you "PLAY" with it 😎
Did anybody from Hacksmith invite Sigourney Weaver over to check out the Power Loader?
OH  MY  *GOD*
bogdan's scream made me get chills. Idk how but he was able to make me feel myself the joy of this big accomplishment.
Can I say something………. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHH
kkkkkkkkkkkkk k
i hope in the end they just make the power loader its own channel, and just show it destroying stuff   like power loader vs house, power loader vs boat, power loader vs car, power loader vs.... you get the point
now that its done make a fully organic alien that has sentience and will kill everything in sight
I wonder what the legal situation of this thing is like do you now need to make a course to train the boys to drive it ? 😂😂
This... iS AMAZING
hope you guys have licensing permission from the people that own the Alien franchise, remember what happened to B is For Build
A skitsteer that turns into a transformer 😂
build grabpack from poppy playtime
Well done team. It's been a pleasure watching this project from beginning to end!
How does @collinfurze have a stud welder before the hacksmith did
Yes finally!!!
Hey hack smith u should focus on the full iron man suit please
Bogdan just going absolutely primal when he finally doesn't have to worry about getting the darn thing working anymore is surprisingly heartwarming lol
Where's the legs? 😁
Imagine if Cat buys the licensing from them and this becomes a real product
After the last 15 videos, I just fast forward to see the thing in action
As soon as Bogdan entered the powerloader, i remembered the voice line from subnautica, when the character enters the PRAWN suit for the first time
You guys should actually present this to Bobcat as a business idea so people can rent them and use them for construction lifting like heavy things
It’s been 3 years already?! Wow time fies
I have those joysticks built into my gaming chair
Me and my dad used to watch this from the very beginning actually. he would have been so excited to see you guys finish it unfortunately he passed away June 16th becaues of cancer  So I'll say what he would have said. THAT THING IS BADASS!!!
Imagine if they went to Bunnings
What ur next big
That was 2 million dollars
I think that tracks movements ( back and forth ) needs to be activated by foot controls....thid can make a more realistic powerloader.
You got to invite James Cameron for the finale.
Time to put it into mass production.
Can you guys make a jurassic world gyrosphere
you guys need to colab with aliengoboom for their alien heads and crush it with the power loader
You merch looks like jlaservideo merch
Hanzhen harmonic drive gear , over 30 years experience , robot arm gear reducer,
Bogden could have just pointed at his shirt when describing to the cashier what he's building.
you dudes just made bank ! i can think of a million uses for this machine on job sites . and i really want one for myself ! awesome awesome awesome .
can you make d.vas mech
Just remember folks... absolute power corrupts, absolutely
Omg you've just made a 53 Yr old man's life!!!!
what are you doing wrong?  Using an adjustable for staters!  👍
Cool welding helmet...except, I'm wondering, what's the 88 represent?  It can mean something quite bad in certain circles is all 😬
that looks soo cool! could you guys make the rail gun from fortnite?
20:40 damn he got dem supervillan vibed just from getting on that thing
But dose it even lift!
Bodens the reason I got a 3d printer
Alright now you're like 2 steps away from power armor.       DEATH, IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM.
This has probably been answered already but why did you use treads instead of building the legs?
3 years of work, and still NO PRIMER ON BARE METAL BEFORE PAINT ?!?!?!?!?! :O
All we need now is Sigourney to hear about this! Hint hint internet...
If only it could move faster. Anyways its cool.
this looks like the villain of a movie getting in his final robot to destroy the earth
The power loader is very cool but couldn't you make legs for it?
When they installed the joysticks, I wondered if they really want to have the arms OUTSIDE of the protective cage while controlling the beast. However when checking the Alien mech then they have it as well. But it is different as the joysticks are attached to the mech's arms - so the design choice is clear. Probably the Alien designers were thinking that the mech arms are controlled by the human arms and the joysticks control just the grippers. For the original design it would have been good to see a proctive cage around the arms as well but that's history by now.
Its on tracks! did they not watch the film?😂
fallout 4 power armor? 😳
Would be great if you could get Sigourney  to drive it
Power loader vs unbreakable box, I can't wait!
I want one! How much is it?
Next mega robot build: making real life BT from Titanfall 2😂😂
Crash bandicoot the wrath of cortex irl
They should make an assaultron from the fallout games and also use it like a mech suit
Like, Bogdan, just point ar your shirt instead of this long explenation at the store… SMH
I wonder what its real life practical uses are.  Moving giant water tanks. Crushing cars. Building construction. Ie lifting roof beams up to the roof.
Another world record pls like if you agree👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
You've done it lads! :D Really excited to see what this beast can do! :D :D :D
You know you can buy a grab attachment for a forklift yer?
Hollywood have a Copyright for that.
SCV Ready!
Really looking forward to the testing video
Next hacksmith Gundam project XD
This is cool
Won't be surprised with power loader with legs than can run
What if Mr beast buy this beast XDD
It's been in the works for so long It's crazy that it has finally been finished
this has a killdozer vibe
you should take it to that auto shop, and show them all the power loader which has been wiping out their hydraulic stock for ages
got the same joystick setup on my office chair.
Will you make a artificial dinosour
Definitely a step up from the lightsaber
This is so cool
I'm new but for whatever reason I feel right on time 🥲
"Don't worry pilot titanfall inbound"
Next on demolition ranch: Can a power loader stop a 50 BMG?
Step away from those hotties
3 years?!?! You're kidding me right? Damn time really flies.
the only bad thing about all the decorative/protection plates   it makes working on the machine a total .....
Next you should make Laser Guns
Everyone remember to do time cards TIME CARDS!!!!!!  Inside job reference
"What is my purpose?" You pass butter.
A dreadnoaught in the making.
Yo imagine if the added the lightsaber on each arm...
The Aliens Mech was a walking, super cool thing. This is a modified Bobcat with squeeze clamps. An Avant 860 with a grapple probably way more capable
Theres only one question left  "Can it play crysis"
Construction workers we will buy it off you for 10 million dollar’s
I remember hearing Sigourney Weaver would love to test it out, that would be super amazing to see. ❤❤❤
Hi, Mr. James, I really miss ur iron man projects Please make some iron man stuff. Like u can upgrade the gauntlet with the laser u made earlier and the arc reactor which u made long ago. Please please we want to see more of the iron man builds And also u can try his nanotech suit Like jlaser made a venom suit for himself it would be awesome
5:36 how do engineers flirt
where did you get the joysticks? ii need some for a project and those look pretty good if you see thiis help me out thanks!!!
Just because of how you act led at the end I have no choice but thumbs down
Finally !
Now just need a Xenomorph Queen...
It would be cool if you made the skyward pride from genshin impact to go along with the skyward harp that you made
Wait i thought it was already done
I really want to know what the cost is
Don't break it now... ya'll practically made history.
Awsome job! Quick side note the editing could use some help. It just felt wayyy to long to get to the finish product. The explanation and walk through s are nice but could be sped up and keep the viewers on a hook rather than waiting !!!!!! Awsome job tho your team gets it done!!
Did anyone else notice that the joysticks looked like a xenomorph?
OMG this thing is AWESOME!! its even cooler than i though it would be in the 1st episode.
Jesus is coming soon repent and turn to him before it’s too late! He loves you so much and wants to take away your pain.❤️ He died for your sins on the cross so that you can be forgiven through repentance and saved through faith in him alone. During this stressful time, He is the best stress relief. Pray and ask Him to save you and help you, and He will. “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” - Matthew 11:28 NIV
This should definitely go in the documentry. I mean making this with so much details and precision.  Hats off to you guys
1st law disabled
Am I the only one seeing the collaboration potential? Mark Rober will arm this thing with a glitter cannon. Matt Cremona will use it to move Big Ash Slabs. Bob Clagett will use it to make stuff. Peter Brown will use it to dip stuff. Letsdig18 will use it to pick up rocks and logs. LEGO will use it to create their own version. Braniac75 will use it to shoot lasers. In his living room. Matt Carriker will arm it with a 50 BMG. Or several. There is no kill like overkill. MORE DAKKA! Alexandre Chappel will 3D print crazy accessories for it. ijessup will use it speed up cleaning up the hoarder house that she is working on. Or just use it to hand out peanuts to the local wildlife. Make It Extreme will make it extreme. Stuff Made Here will use it to make stuff here. Abom79 will use it to chuck up steel logs onto his lathe. Alec Steele will use it for everything a power hammer cannot do. Deutsch für Euch will use it to teach you how to sprich Deutsch (speak German). Get Hands Dirty will get its grips dirty. MudPunker will use it to play in the mud. RR Buildings will use it for heavy framing. The Slow Mo Guys will make it look even better in slow motion. TileCoach will use it set tiles. John Malecki will use it to Get Squirrelly. Double Dare Fan will use it to take Physical Challenges!  (edit: typos)
You said "25 million watch hours"... please explain cause that's 2854 years.. almost.
Looks like rotation at the wrong time and good bye hands...
Only shit, the bastards made it
Just curious, how much did this thing cost, now that it's complete
Holy shit... They actually made it... My gOd that's the coolest thing in existence
Damn. Those mad lads ACTUALLY made it. Remember guys what we see is the high speed almost no hardships version. There is a lot of Blood, sweat, and tears behind this. Epic kudos for the whole team.
OK so I watch your videos and love the work you guys do but I have a small suggestion. Rattle can painting, what the!! An inflatable spray boot is cheap, You already have compressors and a spray gun kit is more environmentally sustainable, surely someone there has used a spray gun competently. It's just a no vrainer in my opinion.
Caterpillar CEO and Executives are down voting this video so nobody sees it. Then they will patent it so that Hacksmith can't sell their idea!!! Capitalism and Corporate America at it's finest!! This is a joke but probably true in an alternate universe.... Muwahaha! 😂
you could probably win any costume contest with that
Alien queen approved
all i can see at the end is how dangerously exposed the hand controls are. they're just asking to get their wrists pinched off against the roll cage.
Tease
Omg Im a big fan
One most futuristic films is not quite as far as it seems
Done? Its the mechanical version of a breadboard project! (i have only watched the beginning)
Ello my name Juan
Now it needs some bulletproof glass in the metal bars, a mini-gun on one arm, some armor plating where there's important exposed wire, and a computer interface, and a government that will steal your idea for warfare
your next project should be a mono wheel like the one from borderlands 3 or somthing
Their warehouse must be FULL of expensive technology and dangerous builds. What is their security system?
Would have been nice to see it go against the other American robot and the Japanese one in the giant robot fights
Is this OSHA approved?
Hello
I want to see Neil Armstrong use it now. Please do it Neil!
IVE WAITED SOOO LONG!!
Hey James can you make Whiplash' little tentacle thingys from iron man? Make it be able to penetrate ANYTHING. wouldn't that be fun? 😆
"Get away from her you b!+ch" lol Wow great job guys! Can't believe it's finally finished, and it looks amazing! I can't wait to see the demonstration video! This is so incredibly impressive.
The power loader is amazing, but the true joy is seeing how much Bogdan is absolutely loving it.  It is immeasurably valuable.
Now this is how you become a big shot.
Will you be using this to help lift heavy objects around your workshop for other projects? Like not just for the camera but for it to have an actual use
I can’t believe it’s finally done I’m gonna miss this series 😢😢
Ive been waiting 3 years and it was 100% worth the wait
Bro you did not destroy a Honda Element….
Join the bean clan show support by spreading the message
OMG all this time and money spent and it is nothing like the one from the movie. Not even close. Really wish I could get the life I have spent watching this series back.
That is not done.  Where are the legs?  I dont see it walking.
I've been waiting for this moment amazing job!!!!!!
Yo is that loader from Risk of Rain 2
Remember to do your time cards 😉
Build it, then design it.  🤣
I feel like one of the militaries has been watching y’all waiting for the chance to start making them and putting big ol guns on it
that cashier did not know how to respond
I was hoping they would put some anti slip traction tape on the step plate and foot rests and maybe install some lights to the biceps and a light bar to the roll cage, cosmetic yet functional. Looks awesome either way, maybe CAT would be interested in mass producing it cause I can imagine demand would rise once it proves to be a reliable all purpose mechanized platform with room for specialization, customization and/or modifications for tasks. Maybe the military would be interested, if for nothing else than bragging rights. Love it.
Jesus that ending, I haven't cringed so hard before
PLEASE use this to unload a freight truck instead of your forklift and film the delivery guys reaction. 😂
Do someone know if the Original Alien Power-loader Designers for the Movie are interested to see this Baby in Real Life Motion? Perhaps Hacksmith can use it for some PR Stuff?
4:35 Why does James have the same pendulum that Ironman has? Oh... yeah, right, because it's James...
HOLY CRAP been here since before when you where still in old garage  it is insane to think 3 years has passed YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME thank you so much for entertaining me for 5 years of my life incredible people totally underrated amount of views
Hello everyone!!! All the best !!!🥰🥰🔥🔥😘😘❤️❤️😘😘❤️❤️🔥🥰🤗🤗🥰🔥🔥
Please make crappie soon he’s so cool with a screw  and self controlled robot please hacksmith
Make dock ock arms
Highly disappointed... the original concept was to replicate the "walking" loader in Alien.
Congratulations
Good job guys
They should make an omnitrix with screen
All I can really say is they did it
It's hard to anticipate hacksmith projects, but at my work we have a warehouse and inside it we have massive sections of I beams that support a 500 ton pulley crane, maybe something of use for the business?
Will one episode be enough to showcase this?
Soooo awesome!!!
You guys have always been great👍
Time to mine some minerals on alien planets now haha “in the rear with the gear”!
ngl this kinda sounds like smth that would be added to bl4              GRBR Bot
Now make the avatar battle suit 🤣🤣 fantastic work guys!!!
Can't wait to see you guys drive that thing around the CAT dealership you got the skids from. :)  The look on their faces...
What a journey, this is EPIIC !
So much work went into this, you guys did an amazing job.  Hope to see more of these large long term projects
can i throw a ball at it?
Make the real duel disk yu gi oh
I hope you've learned a great deal about design, planning and engineering to incorporate in the next job.
Anyone ever played Red Faction: Guerrilla and seen the mech that looks like this?
I want it
After they get done with the car, I kinda want to see how it handles hauling, like, cargo containers and gaylords and thing.  Like, can it be used for its intended purpose?
Hack smith can you make a spider man stealth suit video making the drones from Far From Home
Zero real world application use. A waist of time and money.
just barely too late for halloween. lol imagine going trick or treating with this thing.
you remind me of a bad ass version of Sheldon from big bang theory
Have you guys ever built anything that larger companies see and want to buy the rights of (so they can mass produce)??? Eww, lol....that sentence was awful >.< Just curious if youve been approached. Regardless, keep being awesome!!
oh dear god Bogdan has lost his mind, drunk with power!!
The hack smith should make the multi tool on their logo
He says hopefully it'll fit as in the power loader will grow in the next 20 years
Try and make nano bots. PLS
Amazing what you people do. Respect.
That is another great invention. Keep doing this and spread it to the world, so that when aliens come we can impress them! 😅
I have lived the day to see this get finished. Good job!
Bravo! What you guys done is inspirational and when I say inspirational I'm not using hyperbole, you've took a sci-fi concept and developed it from scratch without referring to anybody else's work (e.g. figuring out of the mechanics of a powerloader all by yourself). Seriously what you guys have done belongs as much in a peer-reviewed science journal as it does on youtube.
I can't imagine all the hours that've been poured into this project...
OK, now that the Power Loader is finished, I'm almost afraid to ask what's next?  What could they possibly build that could top the Power Loader...  GOD, I can't believe I asked that question...that's almost as bad as asking "What could possibly go wrong?"...  😄😁😆😅😂🤣
Yo, Bogdan...DOWN BOY!  It's a van, NOT an Alien Queen...  Put your inner Barbarian Berserker back in his cage before you start to scare the neighbours...or James...  😄😁😆😅😂🤣
Bravo! Love your content 😘👏
Can't believe it's been 3 years
goosebumps. tears
Instead of spraypainting everything, have you looked into powder-coating? Much more robust paintjob that way.
If James want's some Shop Upgrade Ideas, might I suggest an overhead rail crane?  It would help when lifting very heavy items and/or lifting items up high rather than doing it with the forklift...
Do you guys hear that he said the gripper was just an attachment, that means that there might be other types of arms
Didnt bother to strengthen that wimpy elbow that failed last time. hmm.
Can you power load a power loader with a power loader?
After all this time, you finally did it. Congrats, Hacksmith. You people are amazing. not gonna lie, would have been fun to see this thing next to the giants that Megabots created... *sigh* Too bad Megabot basically went bankrupt and had to sell Eagle Prime. That mech was glorious. But hey, regardless. You've done something truly epic that very very few people can claim to have done... In fact, you may easily be the very first to have done something like this. God that's truly something, ain't it?
That poor little Element 😢
SCV ready lol
Amazing so cool, but I just realized what could happen with any of these things if someone got inside the warehouse
Has following this series from start it bring tears of joy to see it finish 🎉🎉🎉🎉 can’t wait to knw how it works And how it destroys stuff 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👌🏻
That's so freaking cool....
next step, bioengineer the alien queen!
it is a historic day for this channel
Absolute wow
Bogdan is a legend!
Still wish they had done the legs like they originally planned to. I know this is close in a lot of regards and that the legs would’ve been super hard to do but for me it’s just missing something. Great work all the same!
Cool to see it finally come together!
All we need now is for some extraterrestrial being to land on earth so we can fully test the power loader capability against a real threat.
“Where d’ya want it?”
Please do gundam
Legendary
So mass production now?
The government: That’s super cool! **Awkward pause** So… where’s mine?
3 years? Didn't Hacksmith start this series like a few days ago? Oh god....
its funny how 3 years ago i was sitting in this same spot watching the original video wondering when itd be finished. now here i am
Puligoat 🐐
so sick, ngl tho having your hands outside to rollcage for the joysticks seems dangerous af
Ayoo
TARUMLÜG   PROGRAMMIERER DER  MASTER  K.  I.                             -
So much for that Honda Motors endorsement.
This is THE biggest project you ever built! Fantastic! The work that goes into all the little details is insane!! I can't imagine what next big project you guys will work on! It will be huge!!! More people have to see this and your awesome team of engineers!!!
21:04 what a shame.  i know starving kids in Africa who could've used that vehicle.
for the next experience you could try stripe please
It's over he is lex Luther
That is Sweet guys i hope you turn it into a sellable product in many different ways.
Now if any body starts a war you can protect yourselfs >:3
this has to be the best project you guys have worked on. 3 years later and it looks amazing. well done guys ;)
LETSS GOO!!
You guys inviting Sigourney Weaver in for the finale?  Amazing work, and mad dedication all around
That guy is seriously f up :o So scary dude :o  Good job though :)
Now it just needs to be street legal
They did an amazing job. But I was expecting them to destroy the car. Not grab it. I wanted to see things get destroyed.
I mean I guess it's a "power loader" but is more like a mecha forklift
holy i cant believe its finally done nice job
THIS IS INSAAAAANE! Absolutely love this and all you guys have put into it, and that you're really taking the time to do it RIGHT. Also, what's the total weight of this thing??? It's gotta be crazy!
It will be super cool if you do another episode of Zombie Apocalypse including this
Yyyyoooouuuuuuuu !!!! Bogdan Najlepszy
This is the moment we’ve all been waiting for
I'm interested to see if it's used in any future projects as a more dexterous forklift.
Bogdans smile say it all. Good luck and cant wait for the finale  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Cant believe its three freaking years! I had no idea I had even been watching that long, so I checked, and apparently I've been watching for four years! Its unbelievable!
Make a working Monado please it would be really cool. (Shulk's Sword).
At long last
Have you seen the alien movie? No Oh then good bye.
I watched from part 1
You guys should collab with slow mo guys and record a load of your projects in super slow mo
Yah I really waiting for this video you guys awesome 😎😎😎
I was 18 when James announced he was making a power loader and I wanna congratulate you for making it real 👍
Can jou make realy chucky good dol die moof
Awesome!
You did it, you crazy son of a bitch you did it
now all you need is a crate/pallet for it to use
Dang! The mech seems cool af This could potentialy be a future mech :0
i still prefer  the  alien-version ²²²²²
this looks like a titan from titanfall
This would be the best Halloween costume
I love the "DANGER" sign. "... it will hurt the whole time you're dying."
21.05 wtf
Amazing job team Hacksmith!!!
hi iam from germany
after this long journey its finally finished
Congratulations guys, been following this for 3 years
Oh my finally after many year’s the day has come   Or has it ?
Man finally I have been waiting for this for 3 years
why don't you use wireless tubing (it is a joke)
That was a smooth segue if I ever heard one. lol
I cant wait to see all the capabilities of this beast. I mean, the military and civilian applications of these.... insane.
Where'd you get the Joysticks from? And the flashy lights.
WOW... AMAZING INDEED!
whats wrong with the freak driving it? sounded like he was nutting
I will not lie, that is a beautiful machine.
Nope can't watch this. I saw an element get hit
And that, kiddos, is how the hyperion corporation was founded
Does Bogden drive his mom's minivan?
🔥
Awesome Project. Are you planning in adding AR Goggles or something similar?
18:47 Xenomorph joysticks!! :D
Please bring this in public I wanna see it
I can see a lot of real world applications for this finished mega project it could replace many jobs that involve forklifts.
After 2 month Hacksmith: Let's make iron man suit
You guys should try to make the tank from aliens next or a mini version of it because that would be sick
Elon musk : Tesla bot The Hacksmith : POWER LOADER!!!
next project:build a rocket to the moon
this is so cool great job
Personally I would've put all the hose where possible on the inside. Like with the wrist if you put the hose on the inside and have a 360° rotating coupler there. And at the shoulder the hardline with a welded quick disconnect you you can still change the arms for something different.   But still, it looks awesome and you guys did well. Can't wait for the next mega project
Awesome!  Great job guys!!!
Huge congratulations guys! What an epic project!
Good job guys!!!
It's the thing from inside job
It is finally hear yaaaaaaaaaa
can you pls make doll from squid games
Didn’t the Japanese robot straight arm this onto its back?
But How does my man not have wrachet wrenches? Seeing him take it off every 1/4 of a turn was driving me crazy!😂😂 Love it though. Around the 13:20 mark.
I feel like I just watched Bogdens villain origin story
OMG Ive been here mainly for the power loader the entire time of the power loader
Congrats Bogdan and the whole team! You really did the movie version justice. A long time coming!
I think this is the first real human maneuvered hydrolic robot I've seen the other one but doesn't look like a robot for me but this is the real deal
Great AvE reference with the sticker on the front
We need to reduce our industry output. Than we save the human progress. Otherwise... We all know 😅
Next upgrade, legs.
It would be awesome to see Sigourney Weaver try this out! Maybe you guys can reach out to her to see if she would be interested. 😁
20:11 I love how the joy sticks kind of look like aliens
You guys just have to bring this thing to the place where you buy all the parts, show them why you bought everything (if possible, of course).  And you have to let us know what the CAT people think!!
Just imagine this thing vs the light saber
how many days did this take you guys to do??
I believe you are gonna win another Guinness World Record Certificate for this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
For your next project you should build the U.S.S. Enterprise!  If anyone can do it - it's you guys!
love this !!!
Been following this series since the beginning and this is the best video yet
As you said, you guys have spent three years, an enormous amount of money, and countless man hours putting this epic build together, no other channel on YouTube deserves to be getting more views and subscribers than you guys 🙁
3 years hardwork!!! Definitely Incredible
Meh!
This thing is INSAAAANE !!!
Wow! The amount of work gone into this is insane!! Massive congratulations getting it across the line! Cannot wait to see it finally in action!!! I hope you have an Alien Queen to fight against ;)
I honestly can’t believe this style of machine isn’t already in production and in use already. I can think of several applications that something like this would be a huge asset.
5:30 weird flex
Who are the actual knobs that consistently dislike these videos?? Why? And also why?
And what about the legs?
It's good that you created a POWER LOADER, in the future if we fly to other planets and meet an Alien... thanks to this thing it will be possible to throw it out of the ship like in the movie)))
They would survive a zombie apocalypse
Why wasn't paint the very last thing you did?
ROFL  With all due love <3, the "Maniacal Nerd Rage" ending alone was worth the wait.
The soundtrack of this episode reminded me of the movie drive.
Hell yeah guys I'm so thrilled to see have gotten it finished yall are an inspiration to all those watch yall.
I Cant wait to see the public unavailing of this thing.  well don't guys.. Ripley would be proud
Was a safty body rig planned as the operator will have to stand for long periods of time like one used on zip lines as I could see myself getting tired and needing a rest every 3 hours.
Can you guys please try to make the VR Drive from SAO (Sword Art Online)
Sweet. Now I just hope to see it actually used and not just "used" for lulz (like, how the forklift was in this video, maybe some other video ends up needing to lift a part in a way not feasible for the forklift), cause this thing actually seems functional and able to do what it was meant to in the movie. Powerloading, I mean, not killing aliens. Though it could probably do that too :) It might not have actual legs which make it differ from the movies. But quite frankly, legs are impractical and partly why I generally dislike mecha animes (though the common tropes is the main reason :p). Tracks are way better, and why this actually seems practical.  And damn, the hardlining tubing really does make it look better (though in a way the rubber spam had its own charm in a jank sort of way). Though maybe what made the most impact was the cage-improvements.
Is it able to turn though?
Dream manhunt muisic you have
With all that beautiful craftsmanship, all the material that was used and all long man hours that have been spent on this project I think that the power loader is going to be worth at least 12 bucks.
God. What a beauty. The only thing it now needs is a baptism in the sea of power rampage.
And now: PLEEEEEEEEEASE GO INTO MASS PRODUCTION!!!! I want to be able to operate one of those, too!  Awesome job. Great video. Thx 4 sharing. Greetings from Switzerland 🇨🇭
we start with one tired Bogdan but end with one cheerful Bogdan - this is the power of MechahaHaHaHaHAHA XD
POWER LOADER be like go back i want to be monke
Can you get Sigourney Weaver in to show you how to make it fight?
SHEEEEESH
Looks rly great but can someone remind me what is the actual use of it ?
I've no words for how far you've come... words like awesome are just too weak... Huge respect for your passion, patience and persistence
It's so impressive. I challenge Bogden to make a full size talking Johhny 5 from Short Circuit!!!!
all 3 years in three words: ITS AMAZING DUDES!
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!
These genuis is amazing
Amazing build! 💛  Needs a 'We brake for nobody' sticker 😁
I want you to be able to craft the plasma weapons for the game Halo and the  alien Drew Sang Heli in the game Halo the Energy Sword  and all the weapons
I loved every single video I watched of the process in the power loader. GG Guys and I can't wait to see the final test!
i DARE you guys to make 2 of these and DUEL with each other
the power loader  wowwwwwwwwww         Amazing job, hard work pays off
So when are you guys inviting Sigourney Weaver for a test drive?
W
You should make something from ghostbusters to celebrate ghostbusters afterlife
Well, time to prepare for mass production now I guess.
we wait 3 years and all we get is 2 minutes of video of it done
Used a stud gun for years in a shipyard, awesome welding tool!
Watching the engine and backplate engineering getting cleaned up with hardwiring is so sexy.
You should send these plans to CAT. I'm sure they would love having a new toy to play with, and being able to technically call it work-related construction machinery.
I would love to see CAT actually take on this design as an actual model series.
10 years later:  Hi welcome back to make it real and today where gonna be making mecha Godzilla from the movie Godzilla vs Kong.
Remember when that thing was just a CAD model
Can you make a Flash suit? I mean, one which sparkles or electrizes by running
I CANT BELIEVE ITS BEEN 3 YEARS!! WOWWWW
Awesome job guys, quick tool upgrade that will change your life. instead of those adjustable crescent wrenches buy yourself a 3 pack of Knipex adjustable plier wrenches with the button adjuster. 7" 10" 12" set. They are worth every penny. Ive had my set for 15 years working on helicopters and they are perfect. the difference is like amoled and CRT or HD and SSD/ 360i and 1080p. its a QOL thing.
Bruh you guys said today was the day…you guys also mentioned it’s been over three years and 15 videos. So why the heck make us wait even more
You have to say the line
This is still not strong enough to lift up YOUR MOM, this is a joke(:
Push it to it's limits? does it even have any?
Okay that's epic but im really gonna say is my name is chad and im 10 year's old and can i have a shutout plz
Well done.  Now we are just waiting from someone to remake Aliens and use this in the movie!
Make rasengan from naruto anime🤓
Para cuando un canal en español :) ?
5.47 and they married
Congratulations
Legends
Now we need an Alien too! 👽
Anyone know the brand of that red straight edge he uses when he bends the first piece of hydraulic tubing?
Why a honda? Can't you crush a junk german car instead lol
I'm seriously well and truly impressed.  Seeing the birth of this mech to what it is now.  I can't wait to see the finale.   I can literally see this mech being put into production and applied to many industries ie Construction, and with a buzz saw attachment even the timber industry.  You guys should be proud as hell.
Next time in hacksmith, we’re making a car
I"m sure you have been asked a bunch of times. But how much did this cost?
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THEY’VE DONE IT!!!!!
"Not only will this kill, it will hurt the entire time you are dying" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That primal scream/laughter though
You Did It. You Crazy Son of a Bitch, You Did It 🙂
Everytime I see you guys do a video I get more motivated to build stuff but I'm broke 😂. Sick video as always, you guys are killing it!
Woop! Woop! Well Done! Cheers, :D London
By far my favorite series! I hope some industrial company buys all your plans for this!
This thing in 1 of a kind, if you ever needed money this would more than pay for itself
Amazing the amount of engineering that went into this project, across many disciplines. Very impressive to see everything come together! This project is what led me to subscribe to this channel
That evil laugh at the end lol
Finally I'm so excited for you guys, it's done!!!
amazing!
Finishing the power loader, pretty pogchamp
Poor Honda.
It's so beautiful QwQ*I'm crying QwQ*
i still remember how all of this started
Imagine the price
One piece
Yes
Finally, it's alive!
Finally, it's alive!
LEGS
Coolbeens. Now make a walking one
Curious as heck to the potential real world use. Some place that requires more flexibility than a forklift.
I can see the military asking for some stuff
You guys killed it, what a build series. Absolutely amazing. But, I do feel stupid after seeing what you guys can achieve!
AMAZING !!!! YOU'RE SO CRAZY DUDE!! 🤣 PROUD OF YOU GUYS 👍🇲🇨   HOPE YOU STAY SAFE STAY HEALTHY 🤲 ALWAYS👍
Personally I wouldn't use a tubing cutter for flared fittings, it can work harden the end. They make a hacksaw guide to get you a perfect cut, then you just gotta flush the line of shavings and clean up the end.
This makes me happy, knowing my patreon contributions go towards such a great cause. Watching Bogdan, and the Hacksmith team and channel grow has been a great experience, to the next 10 years 😎
First scv ever made, now gather minerals
Finally our dream came true !!!
This beast looks amazing!!!  So gotta ask..  Have you asked Sigourney Weaver to come take it for a spin?
This guy is from another Planet. Hats off man Amazing work.
Ты сделал это Богданчик)
Bogdan looks soo happy
Dreams do come true 👍🏼.
That's 3 years of Madness = Happy Bogdan 👍
Lets gooo I can’t imagine to see the damage in person
Congrats !!!
Me: I need a car BSI: SMASHING ONE FOR FUN.... 🤷
Have watched every video on this up to this point, and I'm so happy to see it complete! Also, I love how the joysticks look like little xenomorphs!
Finally it is beautiful
Now we can party
When china made it possible to remember which year this project was finished.
sike guys this is just a proffesional gaming chair
Now do the crowbar from Half life Lol
Incredible !
The evil genius + super villain laugh at the end is very reassuring.. 😂
Now you have to build the Xenomorph Queen
Meanwhile the dude that parked his Honda Element in what he thought was a quiet parking space, is walking back from buying a bottle of rum to get over his wife leaving him, watches this unfold like 👁👄👁
next AT AT as yellow CAT version xD
Now all we need is a live alien to test it
Everyone run, he has gone mad with power!
Epic
This is literally the coolest thing iv ever seen, ever since i saw alien I've wanted this to be real and now it is :D
Loader bot from borderlands v2
I can just see company’s makings this in the future for transporting things easiar
Sigourney required now.
'Tis Glorious
Also the masks are a bit sad... but ontario politics are what they are.
The power loader may not be practical to run to the store with, but boy oh boy, would it be worth seeing it going round a store to see peoples reactions. (Edit: Of course one place it has to visit is Princess Auto, not only for the public, but also so the workers can see where all the parts were disappearing to)  Congrats Bogdan what a journey, as well as a well done to the rest of the crew too.
only waiting another month for the finally
Bi-piedal would be neat, but  beggars/choosers... snazzy so far my  dudes.
Soldiers do 'warcries' to pump themselves up... What do nerds/engineers do? An awkward laughter?! (Next time, try screaming HACKSMITH 4-EVER!!!)
thats the most simple to do list ever
This didn't show up in my subscription feed.
someone needs to grab the end of that and make a 'bogden wail.mp4'
I like how he's explaining to her when he could just point to his shirt this is what we are building.
You guys should enter battle bots! I'd be really interested to see the design and testing process of a RC robot designed for destruction!
That car didn't look like it was an old one. I am sure James wouldn't mind you taking a few thousand bucks off his card. But I pray that wasn't his car.
Wow
Honestly, i think Bogden and Wren from Corrdior Digital, would get along pretty well.
Hi
god job after 3 years
Can't wait! Been watching this lol
Cool, so now build the Alien Queen to have a equal fight :D
Today is my birthday
SCV ready
Bogdan was not screaming loudly or maniacally enough
I saw the title and was ecstatic
Lefty loosey, righty tighty
That was lame
When are you gonna change ur banner
I've watched ever step... & That thing is AWESOME!!!
Hacksmith Industries, Do a spiderman suit in the spiderman homecoming
2186
А где, собственно, человеческие испытания техники? Не порядок
So I guess Hacksmith doesn't need forklifts anymore. I would use this beast even to make a cup of coffee.
Hacksmith built the Power Loader from Alien. It would not surprise me if they build the Hulk Buster that's deployable from an orbital satellite.
this is absolutely bonkers, i love it its been a while since a video made me say whoa amazing teamwork
whats next, the helicarrier from marvel
Great job guys! Yeah, it doesn't have legs, but it's still bad ass.
Imagine going to a con or something as a Xenomorph, and suddenly Ellen Ripley comes round the corner in this thing, just charging straight at you.
You have to take that thing to a Drive in
I'm totally amazed by all the damn great things you're building with so much effort and always increasing skills! It's like you're getting more professional from one video to the other xd I'm so looking forward to see you at the Gamescom or something alike, that would be so absolutely crazy! Is something like being with/showing the power loader at events?
It would be cool if you could get Sigourney Weaver to do a bit..
It's not a power-loader until you say the line.....oh fine, I'll remind you: "back away from her YOU BITCH!"
А я специально напишу на русском... And I will specifically write in Russian...
Power loder from alien (at least I think) i see why you didn't give it legs like in the movie but still very cool and the amount of effort and time you put into it
You know what the biggest problem with this being a functional tool is?  I know it's not supposed to be but rear visibility is nonexistent.  Cool as fuck, but it kind of ruins it when you realize you need a spotter on any job site.
Hack smiths child: " I want that powerloader toy.....  Hack smith: We have powetloader toy at home...  Power loader toy at home...
even is this is not a beefy exo skeleton as the original powerloader from aliens, this vehicle looks cool
SOME BETTER CALL JAME CAMERON, BUT BECAUSE YOU MAD LADS DID IT!! Now bioengineer a alien queen, and fight within a epic battle for the ages.  Now for my real question now you built it, what you all going to use it for.
My father would always ask if you guys had finished the Power Loader yet because he wanted to see it in action and I'd tell him no they're still working on it. Now it's finished but he's not here to watch the video but I know he would have loved it.
Doesn't look that great , not very nimble should of used 2 forestry arm attachments,  hydraulics so fast
tbh i can see a future with hacksmith industries and their builds thats sorta like dyson robotics with their robots
been a long time coming. looks absolutely incredible 💪💪💪
This is awesome. Good job guys! I wonder if you could make it throw stuff, donkey kong style?
finally done! now make a second one, but out of titanium instead! xD
So now you need to build Alien Queen to have truly accurate duel.
Watch out the military gonna steal James😂
Cant wait see what your next large epic project will be ☺️ would love to know see a video off cat pillar review and an opinion
I think i saw a gundam wallpaper on one of the monitors...so when are you building a gundam mobile suit?
Damn a Honda Element is nice
I like turtles.
His scream at the end is probably what I was waiting for...
Why all of a sudden I want one
Imagine a thief coming to their houses and seeing this machine..  He will just say- yeah guys i am just like gonna go yeah...
You guys should make a working Samus powersuit lol
The final product is finally complete, truly one of your best inventions
next video will be mass production of these powerloader lol
Bogdan should include more HS Members into the builds and reflexion processes, the Bent on the arm couldve been avoided lol
Finally, Metal Gear
Lets start the revolution!!!💪🏻💪🏻
Try to make AVATAR movie robots,then you can get government support and loy of business opportunitys."If your endeavor is to win , the ability must be amazing."good luck !!!
Power can change people😂
You guys should reach out James C and Sigourney and invite them over oh and the Queen Alien , lols
Drive this in public and see people's reactions. And also take this to someplace a lot of people who know what this is are present.
Love the use of the scotch bright pad
DANGER NOT ONLY WILL THIS KILL YOU, IT WILL HURT THE WHOLE TIME YOU ARE DYING This needs to be put on a lot more things lol.
Bogdan explaining what the power loader is when it is on his shirt.🤦
please post the testing video fast!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! cant wait to see it
Now build Gipsy Danger!
dva mech
WOW
3 years!!?
And THAT's ho you get another 100 million subscribers
epic
im gonna pretend like i watched the whole series before this video.. go team!
I'm just commenting because this is bonkers and you deserve the utmost engagement. Loved this series so much
Wait, so its just an excavator? Fuck dis. I need to pivot my YT channel
You guys need to have two separate testing videos. Both of them just you guys doing cool stuff. With so much time and effort put into the power loader, it definitely deserves its own 2 part testing special
This is absolutly insane, frightening and fantastic. Amazing work and just look at Bogdan, he was clearly made to wield such a wepon.
WTF that is awesome and MIND BLOWING 🤯🤯
Holy sheet, i remember the time when they do this in the garage oh how time flies fast
This is the first video on this channel I have ever watched but I am still fascinated nonetheless...
Did anyone else notice that the hand controllers are the same shape as the aliens head and with green lights 20.11
I love how the joysticks look like mini xenomorphs
Forklift 2.0
Time cards! Everyone remember to go time cards!
Ive been watching this project since 2019 when it was just a gripper and an arm. But now I have to say it’s been a fun journey watching this come to life with everyone else. Godspeed hacksmith and I can’t wait to see your future creations later on. ❤️
Really would like to know what was wrong with the car they destroyed. It looked like a decent car. Surely they could have got a real piece of shit car to do it too.
THIS IS EPIC it has been a very very long trip and you finally did it
Please, invite sigourney weaver to the finaly and have her testing it!
HELL YEAH IT FINALLY FINISHED- Man- that's took years to finished soooo congratulations! :>
Good job👍👍👍👍👍
I'll love to see some practically tests on this could this powerloader help moving stuff and aiding workshop vs your forklift for example
Hey Tom how was your weekend. Oh I just got power loader certification for my new job.
The end of the video came faster, then expected... 😔
How come it isn’t at 1 million views
Is there a channel who breeds an alien so you can test it properly?   Arg the though is scary.
That's a whole freaking weappon
Happy Diwali to all Hacksmith team🙏🙏
3 years? Feels like it was a year ago.
what happened to hacksmith..... he was always there
IT'S MAGNIFICENT!!!
7:45 are you speedrunning? It sounds like you are speedrunning
all i see is an over-engineered and over priced fork lift 😅
Nice Virpil joy sticks
now have to to build another and then we can play titianfall
Next update on this: make it looks like real Gundam
i like how bogdan went full psycho mode once he got in it.
Nice job guys wher did you buy those joy sticks
I can’t believe you guys finished it, it feels like you just started it yesterday. Good job guys!! I just had an idea, do y’all think you could try to make the predators shoulder canon?
Cool
Well now y'all gotta try and get Sigourney Weaver to come and pilot it and maybe even try to sightly recreate the famous scene and such. That would be fun to see
After one year… prestenting… power loader
This thing is goddamn powerful
pog
Meanwhile, Caterpillar taking notes...
You and your did fantastic, you really are the avengers 😝🤙🏾
Bogdan is having WAY to much fun.
Now all they have to do is make an xenomorph queen for the to fight with it
Lesssss go! Finally here
ok, so ill take 3
Next Up: Hacksmith makes a life sized, fully operational Gundam RX-78-2.
I knew they are able to make iron-man.
I've been waiting for this for almost 3yrs but that's it? Hehe
You tell that bitch to get away from her now definitely
:::::!!!! MAD SCIENTIST ALERT !!!! SECTOR 53 QUADRANT D///HSI///  Power Loader, rampage eminent, locate supervisor- The Hacksmith! :::::!!!! MAD SCIENTIST ALERT !!!! SECTOR 53 QUADRANT D///HSI/// ....
Finally!
You started this.  Show me everything.
Just skip to 20 minuites in to see it finished... really not intresting watching how slow you build things... 3 years.. and its not even a real powerloader... it doesnt walk its just a 2 armed bobcat smh And you show 30 seconds of it working in a "finished" video.... not worth it
Wow amazing video and great work. Glad it’s finished. Just wanted to let you I have been here since before the first episode, and I am still enjoying your videos
I cant wait fot aliens to invade to test this!
megabots? who the hell need them   we have thehacksmith
This is where the robot uprising begins
Do you think you can make a security tight enough so no one can steal your projects. A better option is either have security guards or homebase security, May I suggest you’re very own gun turret, laser tags, security drones or maybe, just maybe you’re very own robotic guard. Would that be great?😃👍
How many people noticed the chicken on the forklift at 7:50?
Alright so next is the even bigger half life power loader right
Id love to see the cast and crew from the aliens movies come see the power loader in action. This was so worth the wait taking the time to do right. Not just some one time prop.
You should take it over to the CAT place where you got the treadbase
Haters: they didn't make that it say cat on the side they bought it from them  James: 15 vids of us buying it
That’s soooooo crazyyyyyyyy
Good work guys
Oh my God even Canadian forklifts sound more polite when they're backing up
I feel the end could be part of an other installment of "Revenge of the Nerds", just sayin' 🤔😂
Just make a Playlist of the Powerloader episodes please ...
But wait. There's more.
Its so amazing to see it complete ... ❤️❤️❤️
In the beginning intro Bogdan's screams sounded genuinely terrifying when he rammed that car. Had me worried there
Hi I love your videos
So that's what happened to my car!   I'm not even mad.             But really I'm upset😥
I can only watch their videos if James is not in it. So I very much enjoyed this video! Great work!!
This was the most ambitious project I've seen from the hsi. Wow! Thanks for the awesome content!
It's amazing to think that this project has been going on for this long; I can still remember watching some of the earlier installments in the old shop in which they were worried about whether or not the project would be small enough to complete there. This thing is amazing, and I can't wait to see what you guys will do next.
This took an entire year or 2but hard work pays off take a break hacksmiths and take a vacation
my car🥺
Nice. But how does it hold up against Zeno morphs?
have you guys ever thought of building a titan from the game titanfall 2
What an achievement!
Let's goooo!! Good job guys!
This is awesome! The "finishing touches" really make the whole deal. It frankly looks so much like the movie's loader it's crazy that now it exist in real life! I can't wait to see the gauntlet of test that you guys will put it trough. These big projects are truly what makes this channel stand out. I can't wait to see what's next!
It's like tranformer but it doesn't tranform!😂
heavy d wants one for sure
DOD would like to know your location 😄
Put plasma cutters on the power loader
woooooooooow!!!!!! that is all
See, it's funny because you're investing in your own channel, and acting like the "boss man" is going to come down on you for purchases that have already been authorized by the company.
amazing
Yeah, but you made the Hasbro one.
Reminds me of inside job
Beast is unleashed
I've been waiting sense the first episode for this totally excited
Caterpillar definitely got their money out of this project.
drive to wal-mart in it see the reactions you get. doing damage is easy
it doesnt feel like 3 years had passed i cant imagine the amount of hours you guys put in to this project, i have nothing but respect after seeing this BEAST finally completed.
This is real e*m*gineer
0:41 just put the Tshirt only or something cuz i legit thought yall are selling james
Whose car is that
🔥🔥
Well built but useless tho 😂😂
Risk of rain 2?
Someone from Princess Auto needs to reach out and sponsor bringing this beast on a national tour of their stores next summer
The dramatic screaming reminded me of an as seen on tv commercial. Like Now that’s a lot of power.
Notification Squad!!!  :D
Hey Bogdan I don't know if you realize but you look like the green goblin when your in the power loader 🤣😂
Stud welder
Make hulkbuster using this
That is really awesome, hard work man you've done it 👍
This is such a momentus occasion!! It's crazy to see how far it's come. I remember seeing the arms hanging in the old garage. Congrats guys!
Easily the coolest thing u guys hav built wat an amazing team
bogdan is having fun at the end
I am waiting this video but I need to wait more 😔
"We're building a giant hydraulic mech" "Oh that's nice" I mean what else do you say to that :D
I speachi you please I am Mechatronics student
If your loader and the cyber truck had a baby, it would be a full sized warthog... just saying
4:44 yup that is how engineer's handwriting looks like
11.9 million subscribers missed this video so far.
The day is not far when Elon Musk calls James to build an army of there for space expedition
3 years just for this
Now do the Alien dropship
Not the honda element... I want 1 of those, and they are so rare these days 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Strongest home made machine
Oh man it is finally done😀😃😄😁
Can you guys try to make the subnatica prawn suit?
Awesome choice on sticks :)
that receipt was still shorter than a regular CVS receipt with one item
Unreal and well done, I hope you guys get to do a montage of everyone who has input into making this cool machine and explain some of the good and bad moments and how the community has reacted during the whole build, and a major thumbs up from here in Australia.
"Get away from her you BITCH!"
I wouldn't say "done" near complete prototype yes. When you can walk it like the movie. I'll bite then, till then I applaud you sirs
Bravo👏👏👏
3 insane years and we are finally done Great job hacksmith your content is epic
Why don't you put a chair for James to sit
Dude so many emotions!!! This was the project that really got me into you guys and I'm so extactic to see it in its finished glory. So excited for the test video!!!
yooo gundam background on the smart board
Trello board! I was one of the translators for Trello :D
We have came quite a long way, congrats to those who have been here for the past 3 and a quarter years
Sweet..this looks awesome
Plz get sigourney weaver to drive it.
I have goose bumps. This has been an amazing journey watching y'all build this epic mech. I cannot wait to see things that you'll do with this thing. Great job guys I love your channel and keep up the great work. Also thank you for producing this kind of content for YouTube and all of us that enjoy engineering.
The gundam desktop  very nice
wow, guys, not long ago I signed up for you, but I'm very impressed with this project, I think I'll go through all the parts
Soo glad to see this finallh finished. Amazing work. So, next project. You know that movie Pacific Rim.....
Flamethrower mount when?
Not gonna lie... Let out a big FUCK!!! at the end. 😁✌
Can't wait to see this one day at Engineering and Equipment shows! Hope you guys can bring it around to show.
Question: What is this type of engineering? Mechanical and Electrical? Because I really want to get into this (learn about it)  but I'm a dumbass and don't know WHICH!?
the one part i'm upset with is the fact they destroyed a car that is no longer buyable from honda. why destroy a honda element? they are too useful to do that to. otherwise dope, the big robot is the big done
Can you trun on left and right?
I know how mixing up directions on a thread feels. Upside down, trying to remove an oil filter for an hour... at least I didn't strip the threads. Did bend my oil filter gripper, though.
Please make Harry Potter‘s golden snitch or some thing from Harry Potter
Omg 😱 its finally done wooooooo
How much does that thing weigh is what i wanna know
They have  to be on some sort of government watch list.
I could see you guys making a flying and/or amphibious car (maybe a Tesla?) 😁
This is awesome. I would love to see more things like this. What if you make a proton pack from ghostbusters?
I feel like that store needs a demo for these years of stock issues
*MHA* relatable??🙃
Let's blow up things with this ❤️
Incredible
Love how he’s just screaming at the end, 3 years of anticipation and work finally paying off. Phenomenal job yall
I think this is the coolest thing about Hacksmith Industries. It's about the team. That could have easily been James in the cockpit of the power loader. But the spirit and heart of this project always felt like Bogdan.
This has to be one of the greatest accomplishments on youtube! What an amazing creation by  Hacksmith Industries!
I’d buy that for a dollar!
WOOWWWWWW
Nice forklift footage. My favorite tool in the shop.
An accumulative 285 years has been spent watching your guy's channel as a whole.
what a beast!!
For the people who still doesn’t believe that the power loader is real just slap them with this video.
Guys, you really should get Sigourney Weaver to drive it in a big reveal !
Next up Hacksmith makes a full scale Pacific rim Jaeger... ^_^
They were cheating this entire time. They have a Bogdan.
Hard work and dedication pays off. Can't wait to see the action
Hey Bodan. You remember when you borrowed my car for a video the other day? When will you bring it back?
That cashier was damn polite for not giving AF about this.
If their plasma based lightsaber isn’t impressive, than this definitely is.
The person who just parked: MY CAR?!??
*Solid10/10 for me.*
Make the Subtle Knife from His Dark Material! 🔪
He has gone insanely mad with power
Hmm.. I just can't imagine for example a hacksmith producing its mechs for workers
It's finally done, after these many years. I wonder how shocked past Hacksmith would be if he was able to see this idea a reality
I remember when they talked about this as just an idea, man have they come far
Unbelievable achievement guys. Man I wish you were all located on the east coast so I could check out your shop!!
Alright next project Doc Oc's Arms
Awesome job !!  PS: should paint the overhead mesh black. one it looks better and two, you can see thru it better since yellow catches your eye.
you all guys are so intelligent and hard working :)
God, I hope Sigourney Weaver drives it and says the line.
i feel like it would be great if your legs were covered, like in some sort of brace. they would be held in alot better.
FINALLY Been here sense it started and boy am I glad to see it finally done can’t believe how far you’ve come from when you started it keep up the good work ❤️
I remember when it just an arm. Now it's finally done! Well done Hacksmith!
I've watched this from the beginning and seeing the camera performance improve and the transformation of Bogden and James is absolutely insane!
Amazing job but where is james
It's crazy to think of all the work that has gone into this, but it paid off now!
I wish Grant was here to see this!
The Danger Warning sign is actually really funny and also I have been waiting for this vid for so long
Sheesh it been a long projet this so cool I’m wishing for a movie 🎥!!!
I have just amazed myself at the thought of how crazy a zombie apocalypse would be for the hacksmith employees, I just love the idea of them fortifying their workshop and just crushing hoards of zombies with their crazy weapons. That is of course until one of them turns into a zombie and then we have a zombie in a power loader which is equally as terrifying.
Yo, are those Virpl joysticks?  You guys really didn't spare any expense!
AWESOME!!
Is the Hacksmith a Minecraft dream fan? The background songs is from the youtuber dream
i feel like maybe black or other color would fit instead of yellow
I’m have literally watched this the last 3 years !! Can’t believe but obviously here to stay haha
17:25 trello is amazing.
I can't believe it's already complete, I have been here for the entire trip
3 years, all that work, and now it's finally done and it looks awesome. I remember a couple years ago when the power loader vids were scattered here and there in the uploads and it was awesome to see what new things were added to the beast each time.
This is so much work oh my God I am weak
Now...  Its time to start the SCV
Hacksmith industries you guys are awesome
You guys should definitely do more in-depth videos for people that have a deeper understanding of this stuff. Like for example explaining that your flare press is set JIC 1/2 or a in-depth look at the brains behind the hydraulics.  By I’ve definitely enjoyed this series and all the hard work you guys have done! Thank you.
can't believe it's been 3 years already, fells like your were making a very much DIY exo-skeleton just a couple years ago
Time to build another and a remote control system.  FIGHT
I could have really used that car.  :(
Fantastic 👍 love the maniac Bogdon lol  😂👍😊😻🦤🦖🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
so excited to see the finale!
The hacksmith team are basically just iron man
I've been watching this from the beginning and it's so awesome to witness this
Amazing!   Now build a BT-7274
Bogdan is just a mad man. Seriously the guy is amazing
I can't believe it's finally done you guys did a fantastic job
wow 3 years it was only yesterday when the project got announced
15:03 oooh man that's a fun noise
cool
Well, now I know wishes do come true... :)
no doubt best vid ever
Congrats
could use some grip tape for your feet so your legs dont slide off when you hit something.
Just out of curiosity do you guys keep blueprints on these type of builds for future study?
Put a spoiler on it
Bogdan had better have a job for life there, after the amount of views he's gotten you over the years..
I hope to see them using it in the future because I've been watching it since it was just an idea
Just wow
This look's exactly like the prawn suit from subnuatica!
Crazy
This is so wild! Great job Hacksmith Team.
That is one heck of a punch list! - And I agree. The flashing yellow light was the most crucial addition.
I just want to know how often this will be used to work on future projects.
Woooo now you need to get it insured… how do you do that?
instead that cage u can install glass shielding having argumented reality with sci-fi HUD
umm.......bogdan?
21:05 that bogan voice crack got me cracking up 🤣
There is no way you actually tapped for that
The project is great, but since the main founder of the hacksmith in the videos is not only its employees. That's not it, it's not anymore It used to be .. 🤷‍♂️
So keen for that test video should be awesome
A job well done!! I love your guy's videos! Can't wait for the destruction this thing will do!
Yea except the one in Alien had legs not tracks.  Noob.
Power loader vs mini cyber truck
Its awesome how accurate it looks but aren't the hand controls to exposed? I feel like something could easily fall and hit your hands if something went wrong.
Wonder what that hardware  store employee  will say after seeing it
good job Hacksmith your the best
After all this time its finished. I think we all new that you can make such an awesome projekt reality. What an Masterpiece
This video came out the day after I asked myself when these guys were going to finish the power loader. You read my mind I guess.  P.S. I feel you should put a screen on the front, to protect you from stuff like broken glass.
That stud gun looks cool. Maybe you could make some other things out of it in the future...
It feels so amazing to see it finally done, being here since before day one of this thing being built has been amazing
So, when is the kit on sale in the hacksmith store?
Congratulations
Bogdan needs a raise after this
So that's pretty cool, but now what are you going to do with it? ;p  Awesome job!
13:53 missed the  “Sponsored by ziplock”
Amazing to finally see this project reach it's end game after following it since the very start! I'm excited to see the test and of course to see what amazing projects will you tackle in the future!
Really love all your vid🔥it’s really inspire me to learn more about it❤️Love from Malaysia✨
That thing is built better than Combilift Fork lifts 💯🤣👌
That war cry at the end there struck fear into all who heard it.
sheeeeeshh its finally done!
Att ustad
This. Is. Epic.
Wait wait wait! What about a cupholder!?
This is extremely impressive
After 3 years it's finally done. Congrats Hacksmiths and I'll be waiting for the test and really excited about it.
PDA : It is normal when first piloting a Prawn suit to feel a sense of limitless power. Prawn operators receive weeks of training to counteract this phenomenon. i guess bogdan will need this training ASAP ! :p
Can't wait to see the final and I hope it includes the CAT sponser comments. Would love to hear what they think of the final product too.
eyyy
I want to work here XD who else???
was he flirting with the girl at the register?
The USA Army: ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK.
Very cool
the back of the power loader at the start looks like the back of my pc
Looking good but you really should consider putting something in front of the operators legs as guards in case he picks up a car by the roof and it swings in towards him his legs are completely exposed
16 parts jeez
and now the Mech Wars Begin
BRAVO! Can't wait for the FINALE! I've been excited all the way from day 1!  Bring on the carnage!
Pour one out for the Element.  (nobody tell Yuri)
I'm so pumped for this
A fallout power armor suit would be cool next, just an idea
buy a giant alien prop and then beat the crap out of it with the power loader
I feel like the power loader has give bogdan too much power and that we should all run
damn he is a good voice actor for minions
Just wow! Also wow! About the odd design of the joystick handles, it's very alien.
this is a dream job ngl
I watched this series from start and it's hard to believe it's already 3 years congratulations hacksmith team 🎉🎉
Amazing
someone somewhere, "wow hey lol that looks like my ca  r..... wait a minute....."
Great job👍 Now make it fly...
It's a shame that all of these videos of the power loader really don't do you guys justice in the sense of really capturing how much effort this took. Maybe in the future we can have longer videos that fully capture the struggle 👀
I enjoyed this video immensely. Thank you Hacksmith and Bogdan in particular for the interesting, engaging and all around awesome!!!
Great job guys!!! Now, when can I expect this at my local CAT dealership?
I mistook the thumbnail for an annoucement of a revolution against James.
I can listen to bogden and his accent all day. Just something about the way he says manifold. 🥰
Wow amazing work!!!
Yes yes yes finally!!!! You guys are all so inspiring, congrats on finishing the build looking forward to more content :) 🤘
So when is the BostonDynamic collab where you provide the loader and they make it autonomous?
Bogdan is one heartbreak away from being a supervillain
Congratulations! Make sure you use it well, everytime!
Hey Hacksmith crew, Bogdan, great work! Congratulations on a superb job done extremely well 👏. I can't wait to see what it can do. Thank you for making Mechs/Labor Units a reality.
so, is the next project gonna be the apc or the dropship? :-)
What a journey it has been. So glad was here to witness this engineering masterpiece!!!! Gives me such high-quality expectations now..
Hey Bogdan, did you get the memo about we moved the test car out bAck
Congratulations Hacksmith team! I cannot wait for the destruction with this. Also, I have a cool idea for you guys, What of you would make The Ronin's Katana type lightsaber from Starwars visions short, The duel, What you could do is paint the katana in super red glow in the dark paint, Then put some led lights in the scabbard so whenever the lightsaber is in the scabbard, The lights would be on, And when it comes out it would turn off the lights, And the lightsaber would be glowing, Also you could install another blade on the scabbard so it would extend when a button is pushed, just as in the Short episode. Thank you for your time reading this, Your loyal Magician, MagicMan.
FINALLY
Well it's been a long road to this amazing mecha, congratulations to the whole hacksmith team
You have gone and done it you mad lads and ladies, all that hard work and seeing Bogdan go from 1fan to pupil to master has been a fun ride, all that work and its done NOW on to testing Great work one and all Awesome
Awesome I knew it was gonna be awesome the first time I saw the first video it was just gonna take a little bit a time and now it’s here
Great concept unfortunately too many different variants of the original power loader
Now you gotta build 1 more so we can see the Hacksmith Mech Olympics!!!
Now make Caterpillar mass-produce these things for storage centers
7:56: I appreciate that chicken.
hey James can you solve a rubik's cube?
cool now build a PRAWN suit
Youve done an amazing job... But: Its not a powerloader. Sorry, i know it sounds nit-picky but it hasnt got legs and the joysticks arent attached to the arms.  So what you have built is a glorified complicated forklift, but not the powerloader we all know and love.
I have an idea for you, make N from murder drones on YouTube.
And this isn't even his final form!
I am creating a mech that can destroy most anything in its path The cashier: 5:38
I hope the people who worked in Aliens see this!
Great to see this project reach its end.  Did you guys ever figure out how to regulate its grip strength, or will that come as a later improvement?
Not gonna lie that hard line tubing looks sooooooo freaking good. I can't imagine the amount of time that took. Great job!
? damn three years?? it's passing by fast, i enjoyed so much watching y'all build this beast, that's some amazing work !
The best part of starting any project is going shopping for new tools and parts.  That way when you do finally feel like finishing the project you have everything you need.
XENOMORPH CONTROL STICKS?!?! beauuuuutiful touch!!
Pure power!
Fuck it just build the army’s armor and mech suits or something 😂
One of the best series ever posted to youtube
Bogdens pure joy in the end of the video is priceless and releaving
so bassicaly they went linus custom water cooling but with hydralics to make it work
It's beautiful! Amazing work!  Can't wait until they make the alien.
Hacksmith 5 years later: So today we're gonna be doing some finishing touches on our Alien (completes the finishing touches) so now that our alien is finished it's time for the power loader and the alien to FIGHT..
The joysticks look like the aliens
Bogdon going full savage at the end was amazing!
Well it's slow...not much use in a fights..  WILL WILL BE USEFUL IM CONSTRUCTION
Now if only there was an alien queen to battle with it.
ok is it just me or at the end Bogdan sound like a siko with th lagh
Support team seas
Woman in the shop CGAF LOL!
Can't wait for the video series where James builds the Bogdan bot and sends him into the past.
Bogdan sounded like he got hurt at the end. If he was trying for a maniacal laugh it came across more as cries of pain.
Omfg!! Now low gravity models. The moon and mars will need some low gravity heavy lift with dynamic articulation! Make. It. Real! Mr. Bogdan, your work is just beginning.
so time to sell the design to CAT and make tons of money making these things for them?
Hacksmith do a gundam shield
Great Content bro Always
Wow is all I have to say
Dude you are the best thing that happened to youtube. Tare some doors for me would ya...
Having watched this project from the first episode really makes it even more amazing. Know how much time and effort truly went into this project is so cool. It's also been fun watching as the channel has branched away from being James and Ian in a garage. It really shows that they have built a company based on what they love and are willing to share it with us as viewers.
How about power Loader 🔥 on fire and burn 🔥 your own body
hey can i hire bogdon to do my cord management for me?
So glad you guys got this done right before I leave for boot camp
I have a really dumb idea, what if you give the power loader a big lightsaber
Needs to say unga, and Benos Mad
Next up highly complex flying iron man suit
I really liked checklist-completing montage near the end.
they made a forklift with a forklift
Bogdan's maniac screaming and laughing at the end was all I needed to hear to know the proyect was worth it. Maaaaaan it's so EPIC! So much patience, detail and hard work.  Congrats on another HISTORIC accomplishment, and I can't wait to see it tested!
nice
congratulations on finishing the power loader
Everybody involved should feel incredibly accomplished, perfect example of commitment and skill. To James, the Hacksmith crew and all sponsors 👏🏻
im always hyped for THE POWERLOADER >:D
they finally finished it lets go
Cant wait to see that personal helicopter fly next to the forklift there
So your leg movements do NOT make it move and your arm movements do NOT make the arms/jaws move. 3 years to make a skid steer LESS functional?  SUPER LAME 🙄
that's fricking awesome. bet it can be super useful for powerloading!
AMAZING AS ALWAYS!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!😄👍
Man dude. I cant wait to see Titans from TitanFall 2 to be built next. Hopefully they do build Titans for their next big big project. Hopefully
Do Power loader vs. Tesserect cube
*cheering* YEEEEES
Amazing job guys I can’t believe you’ve done this!  Three years in the making wow! I want to see some mass destruction with that!   Make a giant tank next
I’m praying some company sees these and they replace construction equipment 😂
You should hire a child to tutor 🙂
The joy sticks look like Aliens and I love it
Only way to make it more awesome, have Sigorny weaver come pilot it.
I taped this so fast my phone almost fell on the floor
Imagine walking into a warehouse full of these in 5 years 👌
Please get Sigourney Weaver for the finale
I have the same Digikey ruler,  it's so awesome your using the same thing, I use it all the time
SCV Ready!
That looks fun and scary to drive
Amazing project! Cant wait for the finale!
Yes YOU DID IT
Little did they know that the thing they made would be revolutionary, and then 300 years later a boy with multi colored hair would begin his adventure with his mecha and will change his hair color after finding out his father was the villain all along.
Wow. A skid steer with arms. Not impressed.
I cant believe its FINALLY done
John cena vs mech
Finally!! Coolest thing ever
Pop one hydraulic hose and it’s over.
i saw how started and now i feel proud abot the thing you made
Am i the only one who thought it was already done? lol
That’s amazing
Is this Bogdan's final form?
8/10
“And that’s about it!” Ah yes, only 17 things to do
Where is the winter soldier arm test
Ever consider getting into combat robotics?
Truly an amazing accomplishment for all involved. Congrats on finishing it.
I came her to watch it smash thingggssssss
I sometimes get my inspiration from you guys for my school's robotics team! We are in FTC freight frenzy this year and your ideas seem great!
Even the joysticks have small alien heads :)
Milk 🥛
😂 I can’t stop smiling 😁😁😁
Imagine if James just comes out and says "Bogdan... That's my car..."
next step, legs
Wow awesome 😎👍!
You guys should make a transforming monster hunter weapon
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, its amazing how far you have come, I started watching this masterpiece of a show when you made Han Solo's blaster pistol and from there my life was changed, I wish I could give you more than one Sub because you guys deserve a million. Also is it actually legal to build a mech? I wouldn't be surprised if the Government turned up at your door and offer you a job as a weapons engineer, who knows, wars might be fought with robots instead of solders. Who knows?
It actually looks amazing.. it is a million times better than before
Take it on Battle bots😂
6:47 would have been funny if they staged it so it looked like they cut it off with the lightsaber.
So cool being able to see this project evolve and I’m glad I stayed to see it fully finished
Yay congrats on 2mil 🥳🥳🥳
Now do the prawn suit from subnautica
the final product is so clean!  it was a great idea to replace part of the hydraulics with rigid pipes! really curious to see what it can do
Damn that car was nicer then what I drive 😔. Cool build unfortunately the car had more use day to day
Mrbeast:I'll take your entire stock
this is awesome! I've been watching it from the start and It's so great to see it done! (though I STILL think it needs something to protect the operators legs from debris and shifting loads)
You: After 3 long years....it's complete! You in your sleep: But.....it really should be made to walk though
God I wish I’d work for you guys
Why does bogdan always remind me of Mr. Bean
5:24 why not just point to your shirt and say, "we're building this..." Lol
Are there any female engineers in Hacksmith world?
Someone's high powder loader
Great job! It looks amazing! All that hard work and perseverance paid off 👌
Can u all pls build a battlebot and compete in battlebots
Eeeeeeepic!
Finally it done this is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!.👍  ps. Can you make coma the doof warriors flamethrower guitar next please?❤
I'm still waiting for the real thing with legs.  Here's looking forward to 2.0 expansion pack.
Watching this whole channel get to where it is at makes me very happy!  This Power Loader is 100% a beautiful piece of engineering!
Congrats on finishing this huge project guys!
The dispute solver 9000
😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yay it’s so cool
Canadian yellow death mech
Wow, the journey to completion had been so long but it's been fantastic watching it every step of the way. The Powerloader turned out amazing and so clean! Can't wait for the finale demo!
Can you please 🥺 make a doom slayer sword
Proud dad moment no lie😂.
Note to self: Do not piss off Bogdan.
It’s so funny how Bogdon goes mentally insane at the end
7:55 is that an ultralight heli attempt ?
This is so awesome i have been waiting and no it's here great work. love it . And there's a lot af wired bots spamming comments on you're vids
This is the coolest thing yall have ever made. I miss James tho
There it is, "pro-ject"
Now make a suit version of it that has a grapple, i dare you.
Make woverens claws
Congrats Bogdan! It’s been amazing to watch the power loaders entire journey, and I’m so excited to see it turn out above and beyond all expectations!
How much would one of these baby’s set me back?
Subscribed 👍
1v1
Sweet been waiting for a while
its insane that I have been watching since the beginning. I guess I didn't realize until this video.
Hey, tip for hacksmith industries. If you need shop pads so you can rest parts without scratching them, ask your local architecture firms. We are always getting in 2x2 carpet samples to show to clients. When we are done with them, a few companies have sendbacks, but a majority of the time they just get tossed or stuck under someones desk for 3 years. My old roommate and I took them all home and carpeted our entire basement with them.
awsome project!
Could you guys make osa's tallon 8 shield from rainbow 6 Siege?
You know it's been worth it when you watch that car get destroyed
So…. Do you think any one has approached Sigourney To see if she fancies a spin ?
Finally! Amazing! Congrats Bogdan and team!
finally !!!!!
I like how it says, "Some Car Smashy" at the end
swear they"re gonna make the first actually usable jetpack next
You should do the Poppy Playtime grab pack!
very nice guys. you have done it.....
Yes finally we have been waiting for so long
OMG FINALLY!! good job👍, i remember watching the first video all the way to this one for 2, almost 3 years!! And finally get so see the finished product😀
Now time to build a gundam
Only thing I'm wondering is who's car is that?
The us space force: we will be watching your progress with great interest
This should really be titled "Finishing the Power Loader"....sigh another episode before we can see it in action. Can't wait though!
That's some really nice clean work! I really appreciate seeing the care put into making the functional parts look great whether they're seen or not; it's that touch of pride in your work that really stands out and shows in the final result!
can you lift up a car at least with this thing?
Congrats boys
Bogdon flirting with the cashier made it into the video that's awesome
I can't even imagine how good it must feel for something you've worked on for so long be complete. Incredible project
3:39 damn that was a smooth transition to the sponser.
definitely one of the coolest HSI projects
5:17 If only Bogdan had an easy to access image of what they are building. Possibly on his chest.
at long last its finished yay!!!!!
We won our final soccer game and this is a great way to celebrate the win
Killdozer 2.0
He did it. The crazy SOB actually did it!
next project: power loader with legs?😉
ER DOCTOR HERE !!! I WATCHED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. AMAZIGN WORK AS ALWAYS. STAY SAFE EVERYONE !!!! 🗽👍🚑
He’a all grown up😢
Like making a bicycle but 1000 harder
this is too cool
the one in the movie walked ....... cmon guys !!!!!!! you guys were close but left out a ton of things !!!!
Noice
Un trabajo impresionante , los felicito muchachos un trabajo digno del cine , algo que todos desearíamos conducir , excelente de verdad
Bogdan went full rage there at the end 🤣
The time has finally come, the xenomorphs are done for lol
just to see them work is beautiful
I bet JCB and Caterpillar have already bought the design and schematics for this beast as it takes their business to the next level
Greatest project ever! I still remember how hyped I was when the first video came out, awesome to see you guys finally get it done!
cracking job, just missing one vital part.. thats foot straps. the one from Alien, even though its not got tracks like this, still had foot straps. think it needs something there just to stop your feet from flailing about should it get interesting.
You should make the arms controllable with VR controllers with tracking
Haha Bogdan accidentally said it was 3 years in stead of 3 months... wait
What's that moving thing in the office???
I Can’t believe it’s been three years
is there any kind of limit for arm movement so you dont accidentally crush your arm between the machines arm and the cage, or snap off the joysticks?
And thus bogdan was released on the world.  Guys our overlord has been summoned.
they need to get Sigourney Weaver to pilot this
Some video ideas: Halo Suit, hologram tv, compact working exoeskeleton, invisible sheet, foldable gun, Mask (from any famous character or a invented one) that can reproduce every real facial expression of it's user
Thanks for sharing ! Wow, that clean up looks so good ! Awesome work.
Only way to top this series would be to have Sigourney Weaver come and have a blast in it lol
Finally
Next step: world Domination xD
It seems to me that when you switched to hydraulic tubing, you went smaller than 3/8. This can reduce the speed of the hydraulic cylinders on the tines.
Ein Kommentar
i wanna see this face off an unbreakable box
Next, they’re gonna make Evangelion Unit 01.
Awesome job guys looks super cool excited for the test video
dream
the editing is on point
I just came 🤤
It's been awesome watching your journey! You have grown so much from lightsaber vfx, to real protosaber, and now an actual Alien power loader. I'm sure you'll want a break from a big project, but look forward to your next big as well as each of your small projects! Greta job for Hacksmith, Bogdan and the whole team! I may not be an engineer (I'm in nursing school) but I still enjoy and am able to understand your videos!
And now to mass produce it for the public
This could’ve been made a lot more interesting by actually going into the engineering rather than being all media production about it
It took you long enough
EVERYBODY REMEMBER TO DO TIME CARDS
I've waited for SO long
To be honest, 3 years ago I wasn't so sure this thing would ever be finished, but it turned out to be an epic project in scale and execution. And also imagine how much faster and better other projects will go from all the things you guys learned with this one. Well done.
I love that Bogdan is the one piloting for the first time. We love you James, but this has really become Bogdan's baby and it turned out magnificent.
Congratulations Hacksmith Team!! I remember when this series began I was a freshman in college, I graduated on may :,)
If the government funded you guys to make more of these it would be amazing to these as a moon bot
Using the forklift to build the mech has the same vibes as using Internet Explorer to download Chrome
Ahahahaaha!! shhhreeeeeeeee!!!! Ahahahaha!!
This beast even has limits?
yup confirmed they can definitely take over the world
So excited for this!!!! Watching it right now :)  -Joe @ Rogue Fab
Imagine they become evil
You guys should make a actually Ironman glove that actually shots real repolsers that would be sick
Id like 20 ordered to my house
They actually made a real life mech robot... Absolute madlads!
James: - it's my car...
So great to see you guys finally finish it! 🥳
Now we just need CAT engineers to see this thing in action, also the people who developed the original concept for it in the movie
Bro the cliff hanger at the end of this video is something I absolutely don't want to wait for but have to anyway
It's been a long journey indeed, and it's worth the effort and time.
I think the next project you do that will take years Is making entire functioning a Titanfall Titan You don't have to make it move on it's on because ais aren't advance enough to do that kind of stuff right now but I would like to see 1 that actually moves around functions
Let’s goooooooooo
Call Ripley!
A good tip, with the stud welder, have a spray bottle at the side with some soapy water, push a small hole so i glides ind better, spray the hole with the soapy water, it should make it way easier to clean the black stuff there comes when you weld :D
Hello Peter
I've waited so long to see this. I first subscribed to watch this amazing machine come to life. And it was worth the wait! Great job, guys! 👍😀
Man I still remember when you started it all, more history in the making
Linus would watercool this ^^
The section title at the end lol “Some Car Smashy”
It was so amazing to watch you guys make this crazy project that you guys have worked so hard to make I actually think that this was one of the the first videos I watched of you guys , congratulations hacksmith team.
Alright! And with joysticks
Congrats on the completion!
Remember, Not subscribing to this man is now a federal war crime
your scream at the end though
Damn, that reciept was almost as long as the reciepts you get at CVS for 2 cokes
It's enough to make a grown man cry, I was watching this series from ep 1, I am glad to see it through
Any ETA/plans on the walking version? I'm sure Boston Dynamics would be willing to contribute 😄
All you did was broke glass. Wow
Bogdan's excitement after impaling that car was my excitement as well
Love how main guy went from being involved in everything to not being in the videos much apart from finished stuff
My mans looks like an Elf 😂 20:49
Amazing!
holy shit after yearss
So... How long until you start on a functional Jaeger?
AWESOME
Wtf so Amazing, Youtube Engineering is way ahead of every Corporation dammmm. RND at Boeing Billions, and Hacksmith and JLazer out here inventing Avengers Weapons for thousands of Dollars 😂😂😂 Youtube is Life
Wait u guys finished it finally
1 i wanna see the cost. 2 i wanna see the original chick pilot thie
Finnaly!
Please  more this kind crafting videos! Looovvee that kind learning.  Tnx for all videos and learning! !!!
This reminds me of the mech troop from Battle Nations (if anyone remembers this game)
I feel bad for you guys
So what is the next multi year project?
Absolutely amazing job.  Getting all those components neat like that is fantastic.  Great job!
Make that 16 episodes
everything is awesome even Bogdan's scream! lol
You guys need to invite Sigourney Weaver to your shop to drive that thing! And get her to say "Get away for her, you bitch!" Maybe build a Queen Alien for her to fight with? LOL  This thing is BEYOND AWESOME!!!
who's car was that😳
This is amazing, incredible job. Its crazy to think this has been going on for 3 years.
Thats awesome!
Sick but Way to replace humans
enter mr.beast ptsd here
This is my favourite thing you have built to date! So cool! Hyped for the finale! 🙌
Did James lose passion for his own project because he hasn’t even been building the power loader for the past couple episodes in the series?
Can I just say those transitions in the montage you are so nice
Cameron needs to see this. He’d be impressed
I remember watching the first part of the series way back, still in James's garage and looking back it's insane what happened in the time since then. The PowerLoader was a constant in Hacksmith Industries' growth and seeing it completed is a nice metaphor for how far the Hacksmith team has come. Amazing stuff, can't wait to see the damage this thing does.
I don't know if I've ever felt more satisfied in my life. Great job this is awesome!
Kids, when you grow up you get big toys that make loud sounds and have big lights and you get money for playing with them. Why WOULDN'T you wanna grow up?
If you could mass produce these, you would make building on construction sites a lot more easier and safer. Way to go hacksmith! Loved watching every vid along the way. Here’s to more!🥂
That's not leather😔
Neeeearly finished. What about the flame thrower that Ripley had on her loader? 🔥 💪 👽
Omg it looks AMAZING
So Thatchers amizing you Guss finally finished
Amazing work, y’all! I bet Bogdan is ready to take a break. Seems like now that the hardware is done, software and control interfaces are due for optimization! Maybe you could control it remotely using a scale model that you position. That would be so cool!
So glad you guys could see this project through to the finish, absolutely fricking incredible
Oh. My. God......it's _done!_ And it's *_glorious!_*
market it
Reminds me of the James Bruton hulk buster journey
Team Buff Bodgan - put that on a shirt
cool now make another one     :>
no.. you cant just build a whole mech... no.. how..
Not to be rude buuuttt.  It looks like a human with a Thicccccccc *redacted*
Anyone else watched inside job on Netflix this is very similar
Finally, Titanfall 3 news
What happened with the winter soldier testing?
YOOOOO
Pizza
where do they get the funds for all this? 🤨
This is epic! Can't wait for the finally!
🥳 wooo
Now to mount the grapple hook swing line!  Just realized.. this might be the last time I can make that joke... it's been a terrific adventure and can't wait to see the testing vid(s)!  Congrats to the entire team for making something completely impractical, amazing to see, and proof that the "rule of cool" is enough reason to do something!
Ok
Awesome job! Also the joysticks almost look like miniature alien heads from The movie. Be cool if the joysticks were switched out to actually be that.
Yes yes yes YES!!!!!
Plot twist... Wrong stunt car.
As an heat-pump technician, watching Bogdan STRUGGLING with the hard-pipes and loosening the fitting TWICE IN A ROW feels quite a lot TOO RELIABLE...
Damn that thing looks good
Next up, adding weapon systems and gaining that number one spot on the fbi watchlist.
i feel like you should invest in a gantry crane, for future large projects ;)
I always have to ask when I see them. How many taps were broken during assembly?
I just wish we could have the legs ;-;
The woman at the shop probably thought that he was crazy when he said he was building a power loader which could lift cars
Imagine going to go rob some dudes warehouse and they leave to go pick up something from the grocery store in that
i think the Netflix show 'inside job' borrowed this idea lol
I literally clicked so freakin’ fast aaaaaa
I'm going to get that shirt and I'm going to wear it twice a week thank you looks pretty good
wow.  it's WALL-E LOL
Damn I really wanna work here.
Remember Bogdan, you need to recharge every night. Also, ugly is a relative term! I like the look of (semi) messy wires and hydraulic tubes! Although I know that it makes no sense to have a morass of intertwined cables and hoses... to hard to maintain and repair. Not to mention risk of them being damaged!
I don't believe you 😑
The ultimate zombie apocalypse vehicle!
This is the beginning of a new era!
Finally !
How did the elbow get damaged? I don't remember, probably because as Bogdan mentioned, it's been 3 years since the beginning.
Raya
You should make Arya’s sword
Is it weird if I have a stiff one right now?
Any member of hacksmith crew walk into hardware store.  Manager: awww yeeaah
Standby for Titanfall
Fire bogdan and cut jameses hair my opinion
And so we end on a "too be concluded"   This has been a long time cominh
Congrats to the team and to Bogdan for an incredible build!
what if you guys made a gundam?
It would be awesome to make a prawn suit from subnautica
i would love to see Sigourney Weaver's reaction to this
Man amazing you guys actually built it. Outta be able to recoup some funds touring it around
Bogdan, shows us his war face, finally!
So crazy to think that i started watching this build when i was 12 and now im just seeing it finish at 15. Good work guys keep it up
M e c h
Bro you just built a forklift
How long until I can order a personal power loader for... Personal reasons
You finally did it hopefully in the future it can be replicated and can be used
i love watching a master piece like this come together it so beautifull
🚧👍⚠️🏆⚠️👍🚧
The potential commercial, industrial and military applications of something like this are off the charts. This Power Loader Beast is INSANITY! AMAZING, WONDERFUL, AWESOME INSANITY!
That maniacal laughter as he smashes the Honda Element at the end is 3 years of pent up Mech desires finally made real.
Now is when you go up to the guys at caterpillar and show off your power loader..  Plot twist they buy it and make it themselves
I unfortunately don't agree with that last clip unless that car was well wrecked....
Him reminding me what I’ve been with this built for 3 years made me feel so old 😭😭😭
wow that hourandous
The engine cover looks like a giant Xbox controller cover lol 😆.
I cant beleve its actualy finished what do we doo now?
YES....
The military wants to: know your location
I was kind of hoping for the force feedback full arm controller you see in the movie, would have really taken this project from a unique forklift to an augmentation of a person’s natural abilities. I completely understand why that didn’t happen, but that would totally be something cool to see in the future! Awesome job guys!
SCV StarCraft.
I'd sell my soul just for a minute to try this beauty!
This is proof of even an idea of creation can become real with time, work and teamwork. Keep on inspiring future generations Make It Real. Your team makes the creations once thought of impossible for normal, professional and experts. Keep on coding, building, welding and creating for not just money or fame but for our generation and future generations of workers. - Inspired Viewer
Now make an alien suit that actually lays eggs inside you...   It'll be funny!
Are you going to use this as a actual tool in the shop for making things?
Cant believe its finally finished. I actually laugh out loud in the end while he crashed into the car on its first journey out.i think we all can image how existing he must have felt :).
I cant believe its been 3 years since I watched the first video.
Such a tease! 😂 so cool to see it driving!
Wow! Congrats to the whole Hacksmith team! I know this project has been a loooooonnnggg time coming and I can’t even imagine the amount of work you all had to invest into it. Very exiting guys! You all are incredible! 🙃👌❤️
Real Tranformers when? 😅
Fortnite kids think that fortnite made every thing, but hack smith think that the hack smiths made everything. 😂
Please pleas please can you please make a darth mall double sided retractable lightsaber and yondoos whistle controlled arrow please and black panthers claws you’ve already made like 5 different sets of wolverine claws
This should be there new forklift because its way more accurate with a persons eyes and has more accessibility
Wow.  My only disappointment is that you didn't invite Sigourney Weaver up to do the initial test drive.
It’s a super bus where the driver has a seat belt
14:14 you guys hear that whistling?
I’m still astonished that you made something from my absolute favorite movie come to life. I have chills.
That thing is so sick looking!
Finally after those years
gonna be totally honest, if the government sees this they will probably track your location and take this from you with force (just sayin lol)
Carnival rides in 2050
Awesome 😊👍🏻👍🏻
Yess I have been waiting for this video for so long! I have been with this project since the beginning its so amazing of what you guys have been able to achieve.
When is the winter shoulder arm test video coming out
Can't wait for this to be commercially viable.  I wanna see these in real world construction sites and warehouses
Bogden drives a Dodge Caravan... How horrible 🤣 Though I'm not too surprised
Ugh. All I wanted was the test video.
You guys should make a mech suit from Edge of Tomorrow! This would be difficult, as it is much smaller than the power loader, but would be interesting to see. (Especially weaponized)
Holly molly, all this years of waiting have finally paid off. CONGRATS ITS F*** IMPRESSIVE(and strikingly similar to the real thing)!
Power loader? I hardly knew her!
Make a decent build but make it cost effective like your spiderman webshooter so we can make it
could you do a beam rifle from gundam
Someday… it will have legs… 😏
i subscribe
Wow, that is like the coolest thing I’ve ever seen! 😱
i always forget i’m subscribed to this channel and am always amazed at the stuff you are doing. i remember when you stated this project lol
The military would definitely want one of these, I could imagine this thing on Mars and search and rescue team.
Absolutely insane! Great job Bogdan! The whole team involved put in a lot of work and it clearly paid off.  Edit: 17:20 for that epic montage
I've been here since the bat mobile and it was great too watch you guys come so far
Glorious
Awesome  (;
I am so proud of bogden man you have no idea.
1101
the things that you guys make are amazing
Okay, now mass produce it XP
bogdan’s growing a beard and mustache:0
Damn I didn’t know bogdan voiced the elites from halo!
This look amazing
This moment will pass onto history, congratulations for all your effort
The joy sticks look like Zenomorfes.
It definitely dosnt feel like 3 years but this is so crazy to see!
Next, TitanFall Titan.
You should make a robot wars robot and then compete!!
What’s next a fighter jet ? Lol
it looks sooo gooood!!!!
Im so proud to have been part of this
This is a masterpiece. You did an amazing job guys. Congratulations!!!
So when will mass production start?
Quoting Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park: you son of a bitch! You made it!
The government is going to love this!
Future is now old man xD
So, when does Cat start mass producing these?
One step closer to realising the game One Must Fall 2097 :D
Do any of these videos get copyright claims form Alien?
Great job. I just got one more thing to say 'HE NEED SOME MILK'
Is anyone else gonna mention he did contactless while spending over 2000
bogdan's a bit of a stud welder himself if you catch my drift
We've waited so long my friends and its finally here 👐👐
Amazing project!  What’s next teleportation?  You guys have proven over and over that the only limitation to execution is creativity.  Hacksmith Industries makes the impossible possible!
ITS BEEN 3 YEARS?! IVE BEEN WATCHING THIS FOR 3 YEARS?!
What the actual fuck. This is AMAZING!
I been watching this build for a long time and I get to see it finished nice work hacksmith team
Yesssss
I love how engineering is still messy with hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment.
i feel a lot at unease, that there are no protection for the pilots legs, other than that, this build is epic! :D
It’s finally done good work guys
Bogdan is having way too much fun :)
Its been a long time been here since episode 1 and seeing it complete is just so satisfying
Next year the Hacksmith is going to create fusion cores that can power a whole building or a suit of power armor.
Sheesh
Man that’s incredible, after all this time it’s finely finished and looks amazing, can’t wait for the next video
Wow, a really big opportunity was missed not doing a gag with the “stud” welder!  Idk, maybe Owen can squeeze it into a Vlog?😉
3/10. his arms are just stationary. they don't move with the drivers arms,
We have already reverse engineered it. It will be for sale on Alibaba at the end of the week for $94.
Ripley would be proud of you guys!
Well done lads really well done 👍
A dream come true! That's the most wonderful creation in YouTube!
6:13 omg you guys place your national flag on basically everything? lol
Just... Wow.. no words.. great job all Hacksmith team! U made It!!
Been here the whole way. What an amazing finish
5:25 Bogdan pulled out the worst courtship ever... typical from a nerd like us LOL
WHOA.. ••••••••••••|||||||||||||----||||||||||• 👓 The amount of specs on the rehaul
Finally.. after all these years
Does anyone else think Bogdan is slowly but surely becoming a crazy scientist with the evil laugh he made while crashing into the car? lol
And now I'd like to thanks this videos sponsor, yellow paint.
sooooo, i guess next on the to do list is a gundam
6:04 bet this is going to be a meme
About time
I want to see hacksmith sponsored by Lockheed where they build something at skunk works  That would be s I c k
Now if you could get Sigourney Weaver to take a ride in that!
We're in for some chop
Bogdan looks genuinely happy with this project ^_^
grat job gise this is the most epic thing I've seen this year👏👏👏👏
21:31 the old social fedora icons. Gotta love it
Epic. 'Nuff said.
Shirts: Really wish there were other colors..I don't wear black-black.  Heathered charcoal guys!!
Yay
Nice now make a "Alien" remake
The upgrade in video production and video style is amazing! This project is really inspiring seeing yall put in so much effort
He just wrecked my car...
like THATS MAAAAAAAD
19:48 is that not freking cool or what bro🤓🥸😆
Now all you need to do is get the aliens and your set
GET AWAY FROM HER YOU BI$%H!
Now build guntank from gundam
That merch is way to much expensive
Next up On the list... ATST
the fact that this might be genuinely useful as well is insane to me
Watching the progression of this thing from beginning to end is the longest running YouTube Series I've watched and I'm looking forward to seeing how you guys will use it!   Congratulations Hacksmith!
Woah
inginir
Awesome video hake smith people
no way dawg
I know cat is gonna try to buy these off of you guys now
wow, that’s some cool crap
Now you just need different arms Perhaps a rail gun Perhaps a fork lift type thing
I've been watching this series since episode one It's finally complete
Even the controllers kind of look like Zenomorphs
Bogdan is so happy. I love that :3
So could the Power Loader be in used in construction or is if just for show let's find out in this epic conclusion to the Power Loader series lol
Its been so long going i've been here sence the beginning
The man has finally done it
Finally after 3 years of work! Congratulations!
You guys remember when it was mainly just James making things he thought was cool? and look at the channel now. It's grown into and entire company of engineering
was better before the theater majors
Wow the Powerloader Looks insane and it works so Well! I wanna have a powerloader too 😭!
Now it need a buzz saw a.flame thrower and a 50 cal.....no 2   50 cal machine guns and a grenade launcher for shits and giggles....I not sure the sell machine gun mounts at princess auto
Here’s an interesting yet challenging item to make next if you want to: King Kong’s Battle Axe from Godzilla vs Kong.
Notice they have to wear mask even though they probably got the shot
Woooooo!
Finally💗
Well done, it's majestic! Thanks or this hard hard work and this beautiful result, I love it!!!
3:06 "We're gonna make some aluminum solid jaws", 18:25 *Attaches silver painted foam* I love it xD
hour 1 1k comments
Next one should be on legs.
God dam freaking awesome well done to you all
I find it hilarious listening to yall talk about hydraulics because it's literally all stuff I know from pcs  I didn't know how much water cooling had in common with a giant power loader lol
*One day there will be an Actual TONY STARK in real life*   *Cant wait*
The to do list is like a chore list nice and long
I need this
Awesome finale guys. I loved watching you create it from the first video to the last. I can't wait to see what you guys will do with once James and everyone gets their chance in the Cockpit of it. I learned quite a bit about how difficult hydraulic and mechanical machines are built and it was really enjoyable. Though it will be slightly sad to see it grow up I am glad I stuck to it till the end and I am excited how it will be used in the up and coming projects. Keep up the good work I will be watching. 👍
я уверен что они скоро создадут атомную бомбу
Instead of tossing a coin you’re just gonna toss a car right? Epic project!!!!
Turn it to an Axolotl Mech and I will be satisfied and you’ll be my favourite YouTuber
now to weaponize it! 😈
I feel so bad for that Honda Element 😿
Bogdan has gone mad with power
While watching this, I remembered that Bogdan started out as just an avid fan, then eventually started working part time  for James, and now it feels like his journey is finally complete. Congratulations to everyone on the Hacksmith team!
You kids these days are SO MUCH COOLER than we were back in the 90s.
my question is if it tips over a little roll cage wont support like 12 tons of pure metal and u will be crushed.
crash bandicoot ps2
Brodan is now with no doubt going power mad
That is sooo xxxxxxx coooool
Great now take it to comic con
How many times did they say, "Thats a future Hacksmith problem"?  Oh those words are coming back.
You guys Are Awesome
Wow its amazing
You guys are amazing!!
Holy crap, I just realized this has been going on for 3 years, and I remember when the first episode came out. Jesus Christ
I challenge the hacksmith to make sigma's weapon from overwatch with magnets.
love how the joysticks look like the xenomorph. SO COOL I WANT ONE!!!
That thing is insane.
Someone needs to either send this to Ridley Scott, or Sigourney Weaver, because you guys NAILED this thing!
The amount of time, passion and knowledge invested in this project is incredible.  Great work!
I really sat here with a smile on watching this thing come to life. It's been a great ride. Cant wait for the finale!
Bro build a full size Jager from pacific rim
The first step in mass production. :)
Ellen Ripley: stay away from her you bitch me: any alien fan know what that from
been watching since the episode 3 and it was so awesome to see this project from start to finish over 3 years, especially since some projects like this don’t get finished. amazing work you guys!
Oh its beautiful
I have been here the whole journey and couldn’t wait till this was finished. It looks amazing.
Ooooh ho ho... oooohhh hoho ho, this is gonna be GOOOOOOOOOD!!!
7:48 when dream is on half a heart and george is chasing him XD
I wonder if you can go to a comic con in this
After 3 years this insane project is finally finished and ready for the testing in the next episode. This is literally certified Hacksmith Project. Keep up with another great projects. Also Bogdan deserve a long nap after this whole adventure.
Yes boys! A fitting end of an incredible journey!
Love it your next big project could be the hulk buster armor
1000th like
Now you're just unstoppable in any "unbreakable box" challenge ever
Make the one ring from lord of the rings and the runes glow in heat like the real one
Weyland and Cat corp.
I think the fact Make It Real is making superhero and video game accessories in real life is amazing I love how they show how hard it is to make these things true and in your hand
It wos time
It’s all fun and games till a FREAKING POWER LOADER enters the battle
Oh no.. our element…. It’s broken 😭😭
beautiful job everyone but especially bogdan.
This video was so satisfying
Bogdown Dynamics.
So you said a lot of numbers at the start but you didn’t say a single thi g about the precise cost
Amazing  Congratulations
What incline can it be on without tipping over with neutral arm position?
I lost interest after they decided to put tracks instead of legs on it
How fun
Now the new question is: What is gonna be the next big project?
Amazing job, hard work pays off! Can't wait to see ya'll do some damage with this beast!!!
I need to be able to give this video more than one like!
Only thing I would change is the color. Maybe cause yellow is my least favorite color
I’m actually curious how much is the total cost 😂
Image after all this time it break trying to lift the car
Bruh, this got no views.
13:17 lefty loosey righty tighty
I really liked this series it was cool to watch it come together.
gonna tell my kids this was tony stark
Power Fist!
🔥🔥🔥
Pffff who needs a forklift, if you have this
So, so awesome! Can't even find the words to express how great this looks. Can I ask if hard-line is cheaper than the soft tubing overall, once you account for the fittings too? Thank you so much for making these amazing videos! 🧡💜💙💚
who else agrees that hacksmiths should live stream making everything
Did you feel like Sigourney weaver in aliens?
So damn cool
So we could have had these things for years then... Caterpillar, wtf yo people have spoken we want a fleet of these. And then we want to make them into the mech suits found in the 3rd matrix movie...
If you guys aren't using that for a brand new forklifter then what is the point
The joy sticks look like xenomorph heads lol
Maybe you can make something from the game god of war
Hell yeah!!!
Are you going to invite Sigourney Weaver to drive it? It would be awesome to have a clip of Sigourney Weaver screaming "get away from her you bitch"
Whoever did the editing deserves a raise
when are you building an eva unit?
World's coolest computer case. Steve approves
Next step power armor!
Inside job
I remember it when it was just an arm
Do atv car
LOL Vastly overfabricated forklift.
GG!
this rocks
Feels like I watched the first part of this being built yesterday
Will you alreAdy make a hidden blade from assassin creed syndicate???? (It's the one with the grappling hook for cry out load)
Get away from her you...
Can yall work on power armor from fall out 4 next please.
When you first thought of this project, did you ever think that you would truly get here? Congrats!
Dudeee Watching this Power loader series you can also see Bogdans and James transformation. Their getting super jacked! Salute to the Hacksmith Team for having this awesome content as always!
So cool! But will it withstand the Aliens?
.
Love it ❤️
And at the end of episode Bogdan noticed that he accidentally smashed wrong car (James car) 🤣
that honda element looked kinda nice. id love to have one of those D: such a shame.
2:39 it's done??? OMG your list is 20 things long that aren't easy!
Finale? The video title says it's done! Jk it's fine milk it out to another video. I'll be watching.
these people are living in the year 3000 while we are living in 2021
Next time on not OSHA approved
Wow! It took awhile but boys that worth it! Nice jobs!
I feel like if you painted the hardline pipes black it would look much cooler, and it would match the black hydraulic tubes.
Yes yes yes yes os coooooooooooool  👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤯🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤟🤟🤟🤟🤣😂😎
Imagine the power they have with that hydraulic gaming chair
I love the vids keep them coming :)
Build a Titanfall Titan next. Thx
Are you planning on using it to replace your forklift/use it along with the forklift? How practical is it to actually use vs a normal forklift?
This is insane!
They should make it look like the loader bot from borderlands
Hello my friends
its already been 3 years? damn
im really excited about this!
Amazing build
Try see just dustin give them an unbreakable box now
not even the birth of my first son compares to this :``)
Hacksmith should build a terminator programmed to get a red bib that the Hacksmith will wear. The HACKSMITH can use any of his builds he has made over all the years to defeat the terminator and prevent it from getting the bib. That would be awesome! Who agrees?
How long has it been?
..Spends 3000 on James's card the employee james wouldn't mind
Well, now We only need a xenomorph
Big congrats
Amazing videos
Time to begin the next project, building BT-7274 from titanfall 2!!!
Fuck, watched the whole thing just to see him drive 25m
Powerfull as fuu, went thorough  the window? Could you not pick it up ?
and just in time for halloween
Bogdon looks like a  young mr bean 🤟
After all this y'all deserve a break! The hacksmith is amazing!
It reminds me of the butter robot from Rick and morty
amazing!
do you want to sell the design to caterpillar and other industries now this would revolutionize cargo fright SS13/ black pants legion style!    MOVE THAT FRIGHT! -TEXUS of the black pants legion
I waited and went through two different phones so I can se all the episodes
Now its ready for the final step... Bogdan uploading his AI into the power loader.
Colin furze would have built this over a weekend
SWEET!
"Weird po*n"... HMM
Imagine this getting so popular that it's actually becomes a mass production industry of power loaders
BOGDAN!!! AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!  XD
So epic! Looking forward to the finale! It's been a long journey, but it was well worth it. As always, these builds and projects are the best!!!
Seeing this beast finished is a historic moment
Finally!! Glad to see this project coming to its success.
Just imagine how long the receipt would be if they went to CVS…
MegaBots battle???
FINALY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The look of joy on Bogdan's face as the crushes the car... priceless :)
Final it is done
Wow
Bogdan you did it! All that hard work finally paid off and it's amazing. Congratulations!
I'l order 2 please, you take credit cards?  😋
That thing is sick
E
20:49 ...
Wow you did it
Bogdan has gone rogue!
am i the only one that found the wiring clean-up so satisfying?
I love the danger sign.
I’m in disbelief it’s been so long that it’s weird that it’s complete you’ve came a long ways hacksmith labs
Woa?! Yoooooooo 😲😲😲😲😲
Congratulations guys! 🙂
You did it, you crazy son of a bitch you did it!
lol at the evil laugh!
WHAT.
Next project idea: Time Traveling Train from "back to the future 3". Or just make a train that needs wood or coal, that doesn't need a track. Basically a car that looks like a train that runs like a train. If that makes sense. (Or you can't do that?)
Congrats! The hydraulic line management and the way the back hydraulic pistons are arrayed in that montage make it look so… “industrially menacing”
It's just amazing that a fan of the channel end up making one of their biggest proyect. Congratulations James, Bodgan and all the team for this incredible creation. You guys are awesome
I liked the stuffed animal chicken mounted on the forklift. It’s super majestic!
13:10 good to know even the pros make that mistake 😂
What a gigantic thing, it looks hard to control with joysticks. This is frikin awesome. Well done to all the people that worked hard on this project. Awesome job, well doneee!!!!
Wow this has been a long time in the making glad to have been there for the beginning and here at the end it looks awesome great job hacksmith industries
I really like the way you guys build things. big thumbs up
Worth the wait
Srry Bogdan
Been here since the beginning, such a nice journey
Почти ничего не понимаю но зато это чертовски интересно
Truly amazing work, congratulations to you and the whole team for building this incredible machine. I look forward to seeing the next video.
This is absolutely crazy insane 😂
Bogden causally flexing the giant mech to the cashier.  Don’t get me wrong, I would too.
😲
When it came to the end be like "MORE POWAHHAHAHAHA"
Finally
I long for the day these become a mass produced product.
I’ve waited 3 years for this and I’m not disappointed I want to see more of stuff being crushed
when I saw the end I was like YES IT'S DONE!!! and then he said don't forget the finally and I went NOOOOOOO
Next the fallout 4 power Armor please😂
This feels like it started yesterday, they build up so fast!
First steps to titinfall
good now make it the walking version from Aliens and will be 100% the Power Loader
Here comes darpa knocking
21:04, Do you want see a bad Tom (Tom from "Tom & Jerry")
Now all you need to do is show this to the director of Alien.
Your hoses could have been stainless steel braided ones they are uprated product
I bet this ended up being more expensive than the flying like ironman would have been lol
Уверен кто то у вас купит это и сделает патент и в будущем вы будите изобретать изобретения для правительства
Hi
gg !
Damn are those Virpil sticks? No expenses spared on this one
5:25 so the project is not just very cool, but also a perfect conversation starter with girls
Can you make the hulkbuster armour
Im just imaging James lifting the PWL single handedly and trying to smash a mannequin with it while Ian trys to stop him
BEHOLD!! THE POWER!!!!
hacksmith is where all the mad scientists are allowed to work in peace
I'm gonna be honest when i first saw the first power loader video i was like no way he will finish that but here we are 3 years later .... congratz dude keep up the hard work and keep gettin bigger
ah next up hulkbuster yelp
So when is Bogdan going to watch Aliens already?!
OH YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😆
It's great to see for all the foamcutting lightsabers and clickbaity unbreakable box videos that pay the bills, the bills to pay are stuff like this. 3 years of development. Bogdan's like, a whole other person now. What a terrifyingly awesome monstrosity. Hacksmith Industries will surely appreciate the new upgraded washable padding, that will greatly facilitate rinsing test pilot pieces off for the next batch of interns who get strapped into this. Also, it's industrial equipment, put an orange triangle on the back and it should be legal to drive on public roads. Also a shoutout to the production team, I don't know if it's intentional but the powerloader videos seem to have no effort spared in being perfectly shot and paced.
The question is, did you guys go bankrupt?
The tunes remind me of 'Purple Motion' and other 90's demo scene 4/8 tracks
11:39 virpil constellation alphas seem a bit overkill
You say it’s finally done, but it doesn’t say final part, so I’m a bit suspicious. Edit: finished watching the video, I knew it! I was right! There will be a final part.
you die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself becoming a villain :(
Thats wy im subcribe
No big deal... I have 3 of these
holy moly…. you have finally done it
Hey hacksmith why dont you revisit your exoskeletons and make a newer better one, I saw a short video about taiwan revealing thier 1st gen exoskeleton
The whole time i thought "What's a fixelbow?"
Finally its finished.
So yall did make it fight a car
These guys are going to be the sole reason the human race survives the apocalypse
Imagine showing your kids THIS.
Y’all convinced me to make stuff
next callab with styropyro to make the ultimate laser
I was like AYYYY A HACKSMITH VIDEO
This looks so cool! I especially love how the top of the joysticks resemble tiny alien heads 😀
Up Next: Hacksmith builds a Mechwarrior Suit
Wish Sigourney Weaver was able to see this live❤
We are getting closer to the prawn from subnautica and lightsabers being a real thing
The next step is to build the gunship from Avatar!
Now get Sigourney Weaver to pilot it!
I remember waching episode 1
And now do a portal gun
Congratulations boys you smashed it
flame thrower
I... I have been waiting for this moment for years... It's, It'sBeautiful!
20:58 *"Get away from her you BITCH."*
Sometimes I worry about Bogdan
i wouldve traded you for my rusted out element to destroy and taken that nice one off your hand :( nice video tho
Hhhhiiiiiiiiiiiii
Absolutely incredible! The finishing touches really brought the full aesthetic to life!
Hell ya!
How many times did Bogdan forget to put a coupler onto a tube before flaring the end of it?
Here on 39 minutes I’ve been waiting so long for this!
Like  Like  Like Like Like Like Like Like Like Like
These guys are the *ultimate badasses*
You know if y’all can make a lightsaber and this I bet y’all could make the ghostbusters proton pack! For the new movie coming out y’all can do that!
i feel so early
Jeebus cmist I can’t believe thos
Now you just need to find an alien to fight with it.
Finally! I've waiting for it so long
well done!
This look great  and I like it
Finally
YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAH I’VE BEEN WAITING A LOOOONG TIME FOR THIS
*Maybe the real Power Loader were the friends we made along the way.*
*Maybe the real Power Loader were the friends we made along the way.*
Please tell me the guys from Caterpillar got to ride it
Can’t wait for the Test video. Such an awesome Projekt👍
Another day another power loader
I will not be surprised if companies want to buy it off him xD
is this from aliens
The amount of know-how it takes to build something like this is absolutely insane, especially considering it hasn't been done before. It's good they have deep pockets. I bet there's also an insane amount of trial and error. Lol
You guys should make the much shut from avatar next
*I love how it looks exactly like the Kenner Power Loader toy, all it needs is the giant cannon on the back!!!!!!!! :D*
Yo, where's OwO at?
I'm just smiling... I can't believe it's been 3 years
16 episodes… crazy..
Amazing to see the journey you guys have been on with this. Also, those joysticks totally look like Xenomorph heads!
Is it weird to get nerdchills for a project you are not even personally involved in? If so: I'm guilty! Really awesome work guys, inspiring as always, keep it up!
That fact that this ONLY took 3 years is very impressive
Confirmed that Bogdan is an evil genius especially with that laugh
2 years later
LETS GOOOO FINNALTY DONE REEEEE
What a beautiful machine 😍
I still love that fact that caterpillar gave them a huge amount of their caterpillar yellow.
I can't wait for there to be a project where you actually have to use this thing.
Yoo! This is so dope. Congrats on completing it
Its been such a journey. Only thing thst bothers me is they keep callung it Alien-power loader when in fact its Aliens-power loader. Nitpick I know.
Hacksmith:for our next project project we will create a 1:1 AT-AT functional replica
So do you have plans for another project this big?
The sheer length of that receipt is impressive 😂 you guys should put it on a plaque!
Love this amazing work guys
this is super cool to see finally built  what over the top cool project are you gonna work on next?
nice
Wow!
I wish I was that cashier lol
if i had a 100,000 dollars for every time they say hydraulic, i'd be a millionaire
Elon musks is gonna get ahold of you to get one of these
Bogdan scary
No way
Omg yessss awesome
Best project ever!!! This is so cool!!
Make a REAL SCV
Just don't show it to Elon Musk, he'll use it to build Starship/Starbase or modified as machine used on Mars for building base on.
NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!!!!!
Gotta love how they broke some truck windows at the end lmao
They built the first functionally sound loader mech
Congrats to all of you for making and completing the Powerloader. Suggestion go remote during the pickup test if the counter weight isn't heavier than the load of the item you picking up it could lean forward.
No way a full sized full Working power loader you guys are incredible  I think you should make diluc's flaming claymore or a bullet proof mech pilot suit for your power loader
Bogdan FTW yall made some crazy progress this video!!
I have been watching this since the beginning and it's amazing to see this project completed!!
We gather here today to see our child go out in the world
ive been waiting since epesode 1. im so happy
Ya va siendo hora de que pongan subtitulos en español o no les importa que mas gente se entere de cómo lograron terminarlo 🤔
Love it
You could use the powerloader around the shop as what it was meant to do... be a forklift.
They actually did it
Don't get mad when the US Army decides to "borrow it"
YESSS
After so many years it's nice to see this project coming to a close! Can't wait to see the finale to see what it can do. Well done!
When can we place pre-orders for power loaders?
bob the builder when you say that he can't fix it:
So Bogdan's getting a month's paid vacation after this right?
it fells like this episode contains like 5x as much as any other episode
Cool, I'll take 5... how much.
Bogdan: *shows receipt* CVS: pathetic
eagerly waiting for test videos
Simply... incredible!
Omg!!!!!! Finally
It is done. At last. -Ultron
Been watching this channel for some years now and it's allways enjoyable to watch things that have been put alot of hard work into work and turn out grate.
Now put a light saber arm attachment on it. Really great job looks amazing!
Big fan of "some car smashy" at the end there
10/10
Hard to believe after all this time it’s finally been Completed!!
Was about to sleep at 4:21am, but I saw the title
love how you have Virpil controllers and didnt even mention how much they cost you XD Only the best for this beast
Well, thats one overly ambitious internet project down.  GG and well done all
I’ve been waiting for all of these years and now it’s complete. Amazing
Damm that’s Interesting
As funny as it sounds, I'd actually rather watch a video of them using it to move heavy loads around than a video of them using it to destroy stuff.
Ok when are these things gonna roll out into the local CAT stores?   In all seriousness, I both happy it is finally finshed and sad the series is coming to an end. Fantastic work!
Noooooooo clif hangars!!!
LETS GGOOOOOOOOOOO POOOOOOOOGGG
Holy shit
Wow that cashier really didn't care
I bought the pwl T-shirt 3 years ago and it’s finally finished glad to see my t-shirt was worth it 😂
20 minutes ago posted
SCV READY!
This guy is iron man
Now you just need to make it bigger, or make a next level exo skeleton
YES FINALLY WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE REAL POWER LOADERS FUCK YESSSSSSSS
Man this may be another Guinness world record.
I wonder how much time it would take them to make a second one with the experience from the first.
Now for the next project: an Android   This is awesome, now you guys just need an alien queen and you have the full set
make a military amphibius vehicle
You should make another one and they should battle
I’m extremely early 27 minutes ago wow
Next build Metal Gear Rex!
Looks at thumbnail… hmm, someone forgot to do their time card.
Great now mount some AR500 plate armor to the torso and a quad mount M2 Browning guns to one arm and Mk 19 grenade launcher to the other.          The police come to this warehouse and just walk back out with an understandable have a nice day. Probably thinking he accidentally walked into a clandestine top-secret military research lab.
how much did it cost??
His evil smile makes him look like Comethazine
This would of been insanely good on just ductions box
After 3 years it’s finished and I’m so happy I’ve been keeping up with this project ever since the first video and I can’t wait to see the test video
Holy crap its been 3 years???
the cashier sounds so unimpressed lol
You guys are crazy!!!!     I love that.
Watch this become mass produced lmao
Wow
Yo this was posted 25mins ago.
Omg I can’t wait for the finale it will be awesome like all your other videos James you and your team are just incredible keep up the amazing work
Now you can use the Power Loader to build a full on Mech Warior.
That's awesome!
I've always wanted the James bond suitcase and car ever since I saw the movie, I entered the suitcase giveaway and almost all other giveaways on the channel.
Since the power loader has cat on it, i'll go to my cat and strap a "power loader" sign on it
Awesome
One day i will make this bigger and better
Dream? 8:04
Its not too hard to imagine that they some day build something that could actually go on a spaceship
What is the spinning thing on james his desk
I’m sooo happy it is finally complete gg
Closest he ever gets to talking to a girl !
Congratulations
its finally done. a series i have watched since i found the hacksmith youtube channel has ended.
Looks awesome! Well done Bogden and Hacksmith crew!
Glorified booster seat.
This is true power
Whenever i make stuff in my basement i always wear the Hacksmith german engineering goggles lol.
Actually there’s 16 episodes including this one
Is it just me or would this have some serious use in the military
Now... What could the next big project be?
It’s finished yay thank you for the entertainment keep up the good work
Quite the journey. Congrats!
Maybe you could sell power loader plans to other companies and mass produce them
I'm scared Hack Smith Might Rule the World
I'm here
now pinky promise we won't see this in a couple of years in a war  all jokes aside , this has been a great journey and i am glad for you all
Here within an hour or so
I’ve been watching this things construction  from the start, it’s been worth it
I started watching this 2 minutes after it came out
IT’S DONE!  Congrats Hacksmith Industries.  I’ve been following this project since it’s start, and it’s amazing to see it completed.  Well done.  So impressive!
Dude if you sold that to the government I bet you they would buy that marvelous work of art for about 30 million dollars you could be rich  Edit: you should build master chief grappling hook from the new halo infinite game that this is dope
Can't believe it's been 3 years I've been here for such a long time remember when it was just a few guys in a garage with a dream now look at you love you guys
*Sure hope this makes it on the princess auto website or flyer LOL!* Um... You should drive it to show them LOL!! ITs a Tractor ;) So Street legal kinda... Well maybe not with tracks LOL!
Robot
Nothing better than spending James's money, I do it all the time! Wait no, don't read that.
Here within 30 mins
Bro when he said 3 years I was like Daum I’ve been watching them for awhile
So amazing. Congrats on the hard work!
It's so powerful it can break glass.

POV: Your early
Finally! Geez
One minute squad were are you
Avatar 2 CGI is crazy
*LETS GOO IVE BEEN WATCHING FOR AWHILE AND YOUR WPIC THANK YOU*
Congrats on finally being done I know you’ve been working on this for years I remember the first power loader video
Damn video hasn't even been posted 20 minutes and it's already over 20,000 views.
you know you have to build a full size alien queen animatronic next... right? :)
No way that the cashier knew what he was tal about 😂
Congratulations guys. And may I say "Get away from her you BITCH!" Also you should sell the schematics to companies so they can use it for warehouses and such.
Bogden how can you be tired I thought you were an AI that the hacksmith sent back in time from the cuter
Now all you have to do is sell the patent to caterpillar
no way. after all this time. FINALLY it's done. as a big fan of the channel it makes me happy for you guys seeing it finished.
15 episodes Me: well it's more like 12 cause some were 12 minutes long but hey congrats on the accomplishment
They grow up so fast. :_ )
YALL NEED TO GO TO A MACDONALDS DRIVE THROUGH WITH THE MECH!!!!
Hell yeah
Could you please make something from Free Guy
The real question: is it more efficient than a fork lift?  Edit: 21:10 yes, yes it is.     Although there needs to be a headphone users warning issued before all of that screaming.. lol
James is one of the biggest chads of 2021
Just wow
i remember wren you started i was so exited and now its here nice work guys:D
This is insane, just shows what you can do if you put your mind to it.
Yes yes yes it’s so cool!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome work
Awesome series so far, but you need to get yourself some Milwaukee power tools.
What I would love to see is the original prop for the power loader in the same room as this baby if the original prop even exists anymore.
Why the f*&% would you destroy a honda element. I have 20 didnt cars i would traded for that honda.
This reminds me of crash bandicoot the wrath of cortex
Why dont you guys make the next projekt a way to find a clean way to make enargy becose it would mean free power for you guys and would mean a new way to make power that maby would make less co2 or none becose of all of this clobal heating that would mean a lot for us all
I'm so glad to be part of this journey, 3 years, 16 episodes and it was SO WORTH IT in the end!
