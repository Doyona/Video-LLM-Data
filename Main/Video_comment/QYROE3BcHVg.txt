Does Portugal need Ronaldo to win a World Cup?
How can you be the goat and be benched
Commentators sounding like WWE announcers lately. Just like MANSAARNAULT says—it’s all entertainment now.
You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
🎉 it was a really good match and I'm happy that Cristiano Ronaldo won
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuu
2 years ago ❤❤
wow 2 years ago tine flies by
Rafael just hitting the griddy

Ronaldo is the best player by far on Portugal, switzerland aren't the best of teams, Santos is just giving Ramos an oppritunity

The way the commentator called pepe old man 💀
Portugal players like ramos, but forget about cr7 😢😢
I love Ronaldo Siri😂😂
I am a big fan of World Cup ❤❤
Where is kobel?
On 1:39 did any one hear the commentary said the old man
Waw Portugal did not see what was coming next 😂. Morocco
MOROCCO beat Portugal and The semi-final sold to France. FIFA corruption .
Why Ronaldo is secretly playing for Switzerland: Ronaldo secretly disguised him as a Switzerland player because Switzerland initials are “SUI” Soo…. (Just a joke.)
Omg pepe how did you score that header
Morocco humbled Portugal
WE ABSOLUTELY SUCKED IN QATAR. Shame on that motherf**er, Alonso.
Where was that hat trick glory for the next game? Amazing what a reversal the next game was
SWITERLANDDD WHAT HAPPENEDDDDAHHH
2:13 Portugal just destroys people omg
4:16 Bro three subs at the same time?
Por por por
Gonçalo ramos MVP for Portugal
Gonçalo Ramos went crazy lol
IS PEPE OLD
Bro gonçalo Ramos did the same celebration of David luiz
Yes 👍 🙏🇵🇹
BRO THEY GOT 6 POINT
Pour 😭 vs SUIIIIIIIII ⚽️
so noones gonna talk about switzerland being sui? AND AGAINST PORTUGAL
Hi
This defeat was personal☠️☠️
🇵🇹• POR [ 6-1 ] SUI •🇨🇭
Love how for Portugal goals the announcers go “PEPE SCORES WITH A HEADER!!!” and for the Switzerland goal they go “… okay… it’s in…”
Por -SUIII
Rizz
Luck
Portugal, OMG.
american commentary is terrible
Dang Ronaldo Was benched siu
“The old man gets his goal” 😂😂😮‍💨😮‍💨.
Ronaldo didn’t won the World Cup
I watched all the soccer
anyone saw goncalo ramos leaked video? he has a nice package lol
where was this portugal against morocco? 🤨
Look at Switzerland at the top left, just switch the U and I, then boom—SIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
the end of ronaldos career
Wristiano Wronaldo
Who else was in school searching the score ever 1 minute? 😂
Portugal 🇵🇹 is gonna win let’s-a-go 😎😎😎😎😎🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Goncalo Ramos' success was only BEGINNER'S LUCK!  There's no way he can replace CR7 in any ways.  Fernando Santos will pay dearly for this stupid replacement.
I'm watching this when Moroccan lions kicked them out
bro just watch leão in the future
Morocco is the first Team in african continent that make it into semi final , congrats to them. Today Morocco vs Portugal 1-0.
Dope
4:30 someone bought this goal keeper to be a big hole ... LOL this  isn't right...  Is this made so they go to finals with Argentina?.... Messi vs CR7? Corruption -_-
What is the thing that Cristiano needs? Humildad. Y puede que gane el mundial como gano la Euro ‘16. Como uno más del equipo. Pero uno bien importante. Como una inspiración. Como Zlatan en el Milán.
So much hype if Argentina vs Portugal in the finals
Don Pepe!
Just realized it says Switzerland as sui
As a Chef
SIUUUU
Why was Ronaldo on the bench??
CR is a poison for Portugal.
☹
Does any one know why Ronaldo wasn’t starting.?? Just a question
The goalkeeper of Switzerland 🗑
I been saying don’t sleep on Portugal 🇵🇹.
I been saying don’t sleep on Portugal 🇵🇹.
Fox got the best coverage with wonderful commentators like Alex Lalas and Dempsey. Great job
That ending was definitely worth the wait
Felix looks so much happier than last few years
Moroccans are waiting to repeat the same job done in 1986 and to remind the Portuguese team of how they won the game against them in 2018. The referee stood by Reinaldo. It’s ganna be a clear revenge 😊
I can't stand how these American commentators talk
Everything comes to an end, this is Cirstiano Ronaldo's end, he had a great run though.  Should retire instead of being substituted and embarrassed this way.
Where was the Swiss team. For God's sake from now on let the English be commentators on rest of the games, not Americans. It's like English commentators do basketball.
MF name is pepe what did you expect
Felt like Port was playing on easy mode when it wasn't
❤
9wdnaha adrari
Beat down
As a Messi fan it sad to see him like that
How you can keep Ronaldo on the bench, that’s disrespectful. I think another Piers Morgan interview coming after World Cup. How Portugal coach disrespected Ronaldo.
Big Teams are gonna line up for Gonzalo Ramos
Messi or Ronaldo?
Dang, this was crazy. And cancelo was rested as well!! Maybe they are peaking at the right time.  If their best lineup is using CR7 as a substitute, think about how useful that could be to bring him on late in the game, the into extra time and PKs if that happens next game
Commentator sucks, they don’t even pay attention to the game. Bro said “two Brazilians challenging for it” at 3:39. These two are always a joke when they’re on mic.
Maybe they should bench Cr7 more often 🤔
What an amazing match!
Ahh nothing brings me greater joy than seeing penaldog riding the bench
This is why he hates being famous. He was being followed by a stranger with a camera. Every little thing he does and wears is narrated. He hates us all tbh 🤣
I think Portugal is going to win the cup
bruh these highlights are so garbage. really lazy work
Morocco has no chance of beating Portugal. Portugal will be pressuring and attacking Morocco all the time. Morocco needs to do something incredible, it must be attacking and controlling the ball the majority of the time. Otherwise Portugal will have the benefit of scoring a couple of time, probably 3 or 4 goals. Morocco needs to repeat the miracle that it performed against Spain, and in that game they went to penalties, not being able to do much against Spain. The goal keeper of the Moroccan team saved the day. was it is miracle or magic, who knows, surely Morocco has played well, but against Portugal it needs more than luck to win. Defeating Spain is already enough to celebrate, giving the citizens of Morocco plenty of joy this holiday season. Thanks
Goalie low key wanted to celebrate that first goal!
The Swiss goalie absolutely looks like he threw this game.
MOROCCO 🇲🇦  4 PORTUGAL 🇵🇹 0
Ronaldo. How can "The Greatest Of All Time"   (😝)      be treated like this ??  (!!)         Even Ali had to retire, but Cristiano is      nowhere near ready to be mothballed !
They should treat Ronaldo like Lebron, put him in the first 20 min for reassurance. It’s what people paid to see. Let’s make my Peacock subscription worth it
Hi.hello! I wish your family happy healthy always. Thank you very much. Have a good weekend. Happy holidays. I wish your sleeping and family happy healthy always. Thank you very much. Have a good weekend. Happy holidays. I wish your sleeping and family happy healthy always. I wish your successful in your work with family happy healthy always. I wish your life in your smile with family happy healthy always.
These highlights suck. Way more to this game than just goals. Fox should never get to cover another world cup ever again.
Switzerland's name is "SUI"
One of the highlights being Ronaldo getting subbed in is such an eye roll
Portugal looking good! and they have none other than Ronaldo on the bench!
0:54 jajaja fuer de aqui
Vive Morocco
Suiwy
Suiiii
6-1
Why TF did they even bother putting cristiano in the game up 5-1????!
Isn't the title supposed to be Round of 16 at the end?
Why do American commentators suck? I'm American, Somebody answer me please

What a bad goal keeper
They score all their goals now like Spain
This is how throwing a game looks
zwiss got paid off Korruptiom

Suii
Suiiiiii
😂 good defending 👏🏻 😭 🇨🇭
Do you think Ronaldo should start
In a geopolitical context, Ronaldo is the US, Ramos is the china and Portuguese coach is Russia.
Emopp
Ronaldo 🏆
As a Serb this made my day! Thank you Portugal - I love you! (now if I could only win the lottery, too!)
Why does Leao not start? He’s a world class player
Im fan of Messi  buT I really feel bad for Ronaldo……
Portugal winning World Cup 🇵🇹
I forgot how crazy Pepe is
...OUCH. 🇵🇹 absolutely overdid it. The match FELT lopsided...
Best World Cup performance so far compare to other world cup 2022 matches. No weak point
at some point Ronaldo had to come in before going obsolete
Lazy CR7 must be a bench the rest of the games to have Portugal 🇵🇹 the World Cup
Yes
Leao did not have to pull that griddy
No one gonna mention how cringy the commentating is?
I just wonder why is all focus on Ronald? He is still substitute and had not done anything.
Who needs Cristiano Ronaldo when you got Gonzalo Ramos  😉. I will tell you who needs Cristiano Ronaldo the USA to play in the MLS; it would not surprise  me if he comes to play here but also a bombshell that Lionel Messi comes to play in the USA as well and instead of rivals they become teammates 🤔❤️👍. Pura Vida
Vince Carter would be proud of Pepe.
What a wonderful game congratulations Portugal 🇵🇹
2:30 Speed yelled ronaldo
Thank you Rafa Silva for retiring from international play for "personal reasons" your replacement Gonzalo Ramos has arrived for us, at 21!
It was a thrill to sit in those stands day before and watch this side. Shouted for Ronaldo to come on for about a good 30 mins. It was worth watching just an offside goal from him. What a thriller I felt to have made it to that place
Why is the quality of the video only 720p? Also every video is under 5 minutes. We miss off of the highlights or really cool replays.
Morocco 🇲🇦🏆, bring on the old Ronaldo
That's a terrible effort of defense on Ramos first goal get in there to block!!!
switzerland just gave up, they like yall can do whatever yall want at this point🤣
Brazil is coming😱
I hope to see Portugal playing like this in every game. What a game, what a great team, strategy, goals, everything ❤️
When his legs want to start to give up on him, it’s only fair that his country carries him to the World Cup. Viva Cristiano!!!
Goalkeeper is too bad
Repent to Jesus Christ “But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6‬:‭33‬ ‭NIV‬‬ J
Ronaldo is just there to cheer them up!! We don’t need to depend on him to do anything anymore. We have our team!! Let’s win with this team!! Vamos!!!!!
https://youtu.be/kWxtR5LHBNo
I don't see how Switzerland keep qualifying for tournaments they are one of the worst teams
Somehow I think Portugal is better without Ronaldo. It seems to improve everyone else’s confidence and it lets them all work as a team rather than try to rely on a player.
A hat trick yet fans still have their hats... Smh
its crazy the coach was right to benched #7... they are more happier! this team does not going to need #7, much more...
10:23
Ramos maybe the next future C.Ronaldo! Ronaldo will pass his legacy to him after this world cup.
Did this fool just say, the Brazilians challenged? On the Swiss goal? SMGDH
Ez game
As an American watching a team like this and others. We didn’t have a chance to win the World Cup .
Am I only one who thinks that Portugal played better without Ronaldo
The highlights of the game are deceiving. Sure Portugals scoreline of 6-1 is impressive. However it was switzerland against 11 players plus the ref. That ref was corrupt half the portgual team deserved yellows. Ruben Dias get elbowing embolo in the face.
it is interesting how americans have no idea how to make a soccer goal replay,  yes , there are quarterbacks in soccer, instead of one there are at least 2, mostly 3, the actual goal kick replay is such a disservice to the beauty of the goal
Leao should also start
Ronaldo on the bench and still gets the most camera time lol
I'm surprised you managed to show all the goals with all the footage wasted on showing Ronaldo on the bench.
Amazing performance by Portugal-   Disappointing from Switzerland-  they seemed to be completely off that game from the start-  like they had already achieved more than they thought they could by reaching the round of 16 and they had already gave up from the start- their minds were not there at all.  As good as Portugal looked in this game-  I think they haven't found a truly challenging opponent just yet-   same with France.   I think France will be challenged for the 1st time this tournament by England -  Portugal will go out against the best defending team in the cup so far- Morocco-  that will be a challenge in itself, I hope that Morocco shows a little more in the offense than they did against Spain to really see if Portugal can be considered a candidate-  I just think their defense has not really be put to the test so far-  Ghana challenged them a bit  as did S. Korea-    Portugal offense has been so good that has covered any defensive hiccups-  but I really want to see if they can keep it up against a team that goes all out in offense.
Why didn't Ronaldo start?
I give the Portugal Manager the credit he got the guts to not start CR7 and get annihilated but it paid off and they smashed the Swiss cause of that move.
I think benching Ronaldo was the smartest move in the World Cup , Switzerlands defensive scheme was thrown out the window with Ronaldo benched
They been trying Ronaldo. This man is a legend. I don’t care if the replacement scores 3 goals. I rather see Ronaldo even if the game even if we lose.
Ronaldo the fallen
Kinda sad to see Ronaldo doesn’t feel happy for his teammates he wants the glory I didn’t see him smile once other than when he was warming up
Swiss keeper was absolute garbage. Half the goals actually bounced off him before going in (hands or legs).
Okay let's see next game if Ronaldo don't play Switzerland is nothing don't need Ronaldo but what happened next step not respect Ronaldo Ronaldo is number one Portugal's piece of s*** man
If I am Ronaldo I never more play for Portugal piece of s*** Portugal Ronaldo is Ronaldo don't have respect from this guy
Ronaldo #1
2:49 can anyone explain why this guy is wearing an native american headress while rooting for Europeans? Is he Brazilian or something?
Keep Ronaldo in bench he trash
Fernando Santos the Architect
The final is gonna be France and Croatia
Brazil coach?
Ronaldo didn’t even do anything that is scary.
Morocco won't be easy ...morocco is the winner god willing
You have to love the rationale of Cristiano's fanbois; they say he's valuable for the support he gives to the team... after he threw a tantrum for being subbed and didn't want to stay in the pitch to celebrate with his teammates.
So um, United is looking for a striker in January and this Goncalo Ramos seems to be um, kinda decent....SIGN HIM
cr7 doesn't look happy at the end of the game. team win is nothing to him. he needs individual data
The Portugal national team is starting a warm greeting from me and the Portuguese national team and people, a friend dear to me
Tell me dude at the end ain't try to do the Griddy 😆
This team better without Ronaldo . Sad but True 😢
Coach had to take out Ramos and slow down the game by putting cr7 :))
Fox Sport is such a joke, the game with 7 goals and the highlight is just less than 5 min, I don’t know what going on with them? NBC is way better than 🦊
Having a great day is not enough to win a world cup. Consistency and the exceptional it factor are a must to go all the way. With all due respect for Portugal, without Ronaldo it's not the same.
Vamossss
This media agenda on CR7 is boring already 🙄
Can someone tell me how and why Pepe is starting but not Ronaldo? I’m just wondering
Sitting Ronaldo out is crazy. Unless you’re trying to save him
The Swiss keeper did not do well at all. Congrats to portugal
I. hope Portugal wins the World Cup they are doing insane I wonder what will happen in Morocco vs Portugal game
Reality check for CR7
What I see without Ronaldo there no fancy super nonsense passes or moves. Just simple teams play with intention to win a game and not going for “I personally want to score in this World Cup no matter what!”
Can they survive Moroccan onslaught?
Ronaldo doest not look too happy
I’m sorry did the commentator just called us Brazilians ? Ohhh no you didn’t sir!!!! 🙄
Ramos was scoring and providing assists for both teams :D
Ronaldo  is doing nothing Or not
Never has a highlights reel focused more on a sub. Lame
Portugal could be a dark horse to win the World Cup! They are playing so well 🔥🔥
can we all take a second and look at the picture when yo click onbthis story, take away everything but the guy in red... look at his body position.
Portugal need to start Ronaldo! They are way too scary without him , I been saying that from the euro final they won
Wth
This is like Germany vs Brazil 7-1 in 2014 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
They so badly want Ronaldo to be a villain or complain. He didn’t start but they sure couldn’t keep the camera off of him. They’re looking for anything to nitpick
Good play by Portugal but in reality is people wanna see CR7 play.
Switzerland with the Swiss Cheese defense! How fitting is that! 😎
Whoever said Ronaldo is Portugal’s player now, either need glasses or don’t know or understand football..Ronald is past his prime and Is not Portugals best player anymore. He’s riding the bench at Man Utd for a reason and riding the bench for his national team. Smh
Man one of these commentators is trash they need new ones it’s boring and that same one doesn’t really know what he’s talking about the other one is good. Not sure what they’re names are
Don’t worry Fifa won’t allow Ronaldo to be benched. That surely means a loss of viewers.
A dominant win, and done with style by each individual. Amazing teamwork and discipline.
https://youtu.be/vb0EVdUDpTc
not the worst player to come off the bench.  imagine saving him for second half heroics.  work smarter not harder
I want to see Ronaldo on the field. Only reason why I'm watching periodically. Kinda watching Holland, too. But. I didn't know about Ronaldo, until earlier this year. First super star soccer player, I became familiar with, was Super Salah, who I saw on BBC, while traveling about 5 years ago. Salah is Egyptian and I don't think they qualified. So. I don't know about the 'politics' on the Portugal squad, or whether this has to do with Ronaldo being benched on his pro team, because of in-fighting, but people want to see Ronaldo. They don't want to see this 21 year old replacement, even if he has promise. Just think it's funny how people think they can make a 'move' and not be outed by their professional jealousies. EVERYone is jealous of Ronaldo, if they're male. And. That's why we need to see HIM on the field, to learn something about being THE great athlete that he is.
holy goodness
Whats the song at 0.23sec called?
Feel bad for that goalie. He's losing his spot.
0:33 what's the song that plays during the starting position review. Its on my head.
Portugal at its best with pretty boy Ronaldo at the bench 😂
When words like "sulk" are used during a sports broadcast, you know you're not dealing with a manly sport.
W PORTUGAL
these American commentators are terrible
Portugal played better wthout Cr7.  More teamwork. And atleast nobody affraid their teamate would claim their goal !
Wow what an asskicking
How dare you say the old man scored... dont disrespect that legend you fool!
Es algo histórico, Ramos
I think Portugal plays better without Ronaldo. The players/offense don’t have the feeling of passing the ball to Ronaldo every time he’s open. They play more relax, see different gaps and take advantage and creat their own plays. I honestly don’t think they need him after this game. This prove to themselves and coach the Ronaldo is an extra player, that is needed when someone is hurt but not a game changer.
Portugoooooooooooaaal
Bro Ramos will not do this against any other teams
Swiss goal keeper is possibly the smallest goal keeper I've ever seen in a world cup
Always been a big fan of paper. Old man doing great thing. Let's go Portugal.
That first goal reminded me of bernado Silva’s goal against Madrid at atihad stadium.
720p trolling
I’ve said it before. CR7 has to accept the fact his body isn’t the same anymore. I’m sure he’s hungry to play, but he has to learn to adjust with his body, and do what he is able to do.
Without Ronaldo, Portugal's game seems more technically advanced, maybe they share the ball unselfishly.
Portugal making teams look horrible 😂
2:50 Wayne Rooney
Portugal won Euro2016 without Ronaldo. Will they do the same and win the World Cup without him?
maroko 😁
Felix masterclass
The refs were clearly against Switzerland.  I say this as a switzerlander.  The world cup was stole. From us. Bastered.
And S. Korea beat Portugal. This World Cup is unpredictable!
Awesome such amazing fantastic epic match
Man, I feel sorry for Ronaldo. He shows his arrogance sometimes and does whatever he thinks himself. A lot of controversies around him. And personally, I don't like most of the things he does. But, still, he is a human after all. All the eyes around him. Every time, someone scores cameras go to him to capture his reaction. All the fans and people are always talking about you (and mostly negatively). It's not a good feeling.
Pero qué goliza les metieron!!
In Europe, I want Portugal or Croatia to win it. In South America, I want Argentina to win it. But above all, I want Morocco to win it all.
Will never understand a fan who’s never won any sort of championship let a lone a participation trophy in their lives to call a dude recognized as one of the 🐐’s in his sport washed up. I don’t even watch futbol but I’m enjoying it somewhat and respect to those guys still at the top of their sport in their late 30s.
1. Holanda Elimina A Argentina 2. Croacia Elimina A Francia 3. Portugal Elimina A Marruecos 4. Inglaterra Elimina A Francia. Amén.
Let’s see. I going to say that. Manu and Portugal play better if Ronaldo isn’t on the field and playing. Just something to think about.
They play nobody. Relax.
Please Portugal teach China how to play men's soccer.
I wonder if benching Ronaldo, has a psychological edge on teams, knowing that a great could come on, when your tired and its the 80th minute, mean while Portugal have now shown they have more then enough without him on the pitch! All these distractions, just wonder if that will play into teams heads.
Brazil vs Argentina & France vs Portugal in the semifinals?
What a goal from rafa leou
This was so beautiful and amazing and hopefully they bring it on to the finale
En el 0:54 😂😂😂 como diciéndole quítese 😂
The wealth of attacking talent available to Portugal these days is scarily believable considering their famine years 2010-2018,well done ramos and kudos to cr7 for being a team player for once in his life
Gonzano Ramos is monster
Now I know why they call it Swiss cheese....
The reason Ronaldo is on the bench is so they could give the other players a chance before Portugal 🇵🇹 had to face harder teams later on and that’s when Ronaldo comes in
Fixed world cup.  Disgusting like fox news
Ronaldo coming off the bench is huge cause easily he could start if he complained,but the reality is CR7 humbled himself and is thinking BIG…..watch out for 🇵🇹 Portugal.
These commentaries are boring
Leao and Ronaldo weren't good enough to make it 1st 11, or the coach is just doing load management
Messi still remains the God of football!
Showing Ronaldo even when he isn’t playing… he’s such a baby. Look at how Argentina views Messi vs Portugal and Ronaldo. That’s your goat
L Keeper 😂😂😂😂
Benfica fans right now.  “ Dam it ! “
Leao baby
This team is doing us proud Força Portugal 🇵🇹
The things I would do to be able to rest Messi in a knock out stage game and let Argentina do all the work.. would never be possible 😭
Pepe - the old man gets his goal 🤣
Rafael Leão, 2 goals in 62 minutes all off the bench in his first World Cup tournament in case anyone was wondering.
YEAH!!! I still have Portugal and Brazil on my favorite list left, after Spain losing. I do want England to do well, too, in their upcoming match.
Man as a swiss I am furios at our coach. He changed the formation last minute and put one of our bench players on defense which he's never played before.
Ahhhh...too bad SUI...u can go home and count the Worlds money now!!  & did I just see a Portuguese man in Red Face!?  Good Lord Almighty!!
Fox soccer& whoever put these highlights together are pathetic. Why show CR7 a bunch of times celebrating, even before he was on? All highlight videos are maximum 5 minutes long yet you show a sub celebrating instead of actual match highlights. This coming from a huge CR7 fan. LOL the 6th goal wasn't even given a replay or nothing, a peach of a goal. Smh
Ronaldo for Portugal this year is like Miroslav Klose for Germany in 2014. Both record-breaking legends past their prime, but still valuable assets to the team with the experience and mentality that they bring.
Spring Diver CR7 cannot score a goal without all 21 players on the pitch standing still. If there's is not a PK this guy cannot score a goal. That number 26 needs to start over CR7 all day every day, if Portugal wants to keep winning. CR7 lost it, its not coming back he's done
Sommer busy tying his shoes for goal number 6 😂😂
What was the defender doing when they scored the first goal. Like seriously he had no business in blocking that shot.
I am not a Portugal fan but sweet Georgia Brown they pummeled a relative high ranking Switzerland. Well deserved win for the Seleção das Quinas.
That last goal was intentional
Does it seem like the only reason Portugal did so good is because they are passing better without Ronaldo   While Ronaldo is on the pitch it Seems as tho Bruno Fernadez has been purposefully avoiding setting the plays toward Ronald’s direction. But when Ronaldo is off the pitch, Bruno Fernando passes everywhere. Hence the fantastic win.  Anyone else see this? Or is it just me?
Swiss team is pretty bad. Portugal is good but not better than France and Brazil. Brazil vs France World Cup Final and Brazil wins.
Indiano Ronaldo
Swiss goalie is the problem.
39yo OLD MAN clowning these youngbucks
720p in 2022? Really
Did he call them Brazilians at 3:36 ?! Who is this narrator 😂😂
As I love Renaldo, Portugal has proven that they can win without him. ❤
Ronaldo might be hitting that dry grass aged 38 but he sure knows how to inspire his team .
I like how Switzerland is called Sui
Speed was literally watching the game in Qatar!
as a korean, im wondering how tf we beat portugal. was this just a lucky game against the swiss?
Cristiano is the leader of this team, on and off the bench. He wants his team to win for the country he loves.
Ronaldo mad he didn't score lol
Why did Renaldo sit out? I haven't had time to follow this year.
my two cents: maybe they dont see Switzerland as a threat to them that's why they let Ronaldo be on the subs. ;)
gotta accept it but the fact that Ronaldo's prime is over makes me cry every single time...
This editing is terrible and embarrassing for such a large organization with the resources and the obligation to cover this event. Truly abysmal. Cutting off comments, line ups, replays.
Boring
Man who cares if I was Ronaldo I'm the mvp I'm clapping Georgina cheeks all day who needs soccer your well off brother
Congrats to Portugal 👏🏽 Heart goes out to Switzerland to see them end their run in that fashion.
It’s so refreshing to see someone in Ronaldo’s position and just absolutely dominate on the field! Portugal made the right choice by putting Ramos in to start for Cr7. Amazing call in the coach!
yo he hit the griddy on the last goal I saw that! xD
It was so beautiful to witness
What a feast!
You don’t need Ronaldo against Switzerland. But against France or Brazil or Argentina it’s a different ball game. Ramos will choke against the defense of Brazil or France…you need Ronaldo to beat teams that are better..don’t be fooled by one performance against Switzerland.
So many hot goals from Portugal🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥They are on fire! The Swiss had no chance👎
Ronaldo understands team in this last game!
LOBILLOS MUSICAL DE DURANGO.
Yeah Ramos hat trick is nice and all. I'm more impressed by him clearing the corner flag from a lightly jogging start
Fox does not know how to do football highlights. End of.
All Flaming Games Coming Up… Netherlands vs Argentina  Croatia vs Brazil  England vs France  Morocco vs Portugal
When did we start calling 4-3-3 formation "4-1-2-3"
Pepe not the psychopath he once was...but dude still is quality, aging like a very fine wine
Goncalo Ramos to Wolves for £60M confirmed
Weird. That pepe person and lao person don't look Portuguese
You can see Ronaldo preparing to receive the pass on that last goal. Why did they score more goals without him ? 🤔
i already watched this episode
Ronaldo is not happy…he rather lose 6-1 but score that one goal over winning 6-1 and not score at all.
Ramos now could win the golden boot!
I am neutral about Switzerland's performance
Switzerland defense is not that good, against a good team in the quarter finals we will see a big difference.
Portugal is better without Ranaldo
U know cr still be mad..didn’t see him embrace leao lol 😂
Need him or not put cr7 on the field he a legend just like Messi.
There’s life without CR7 too much talent, gotta keep a close eye on Portugal
Messi-ish.
Goncalo Ramos the future star for Portugal? Julian Alvarez the future star for Argentina?  Vinicius Jr the future star for Brazil?  It sure does look like it  One thing for sure we gonna  miss Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar
4:37 bro hit the griddy ☠☠☠
I can't wait for Ronaldo to retire. I'm so sick of everything being about him even when he's not playing
We’ll we all know who Ramos is now
Notice how the “SWITZERLAND” abbreviation is “SUI” while playing against Ronaldo😂
Keep Penaldo aka Scoring Only Penalty+Ronaldo out of next game. Portugal is so much better team without Penaldo.
y'all think this game like France or England ??? :)) stupid all of you
Didn’t they win the Euro cup without him(Ronaldo)?
That's how you beat Swiss-Albanian amateurs
Ronaldo will save Portugal this World Cup, you heard it here first
Ok that first goal had terrible defense
Mamon
It's a set up for Messi and Ronaldo world cup final the claim was is the best player in the world. Rigged world cup
Ronaldo not starting and they play better😂😂🤦🏼‍♂️ how could anyone think he’s better than Messi!!!
They destroyed em
Switzerland got R@PED!!!
This game was rigged. Goalkeeper wasn't even trying
Did anyone notice Switzerlands abbreviation was SUIII
Goal keeper looks suspicious
Lets be honest ronaldo would had scored several goals against this weak team but he was discipline by his coach, and a new player shined. I would still start ronaldo next game.
Ramos is a monster!
So glad Swiss lost
Who’s Goncalo ramos 🥹
Omg portugal without ronaldo what a match.. i liking that Ramos guy...
Is no one gonna mention João Felix’s performance??  Absolutely phenomenal every touch was beautiful to watch.  This is what we’ve been waiting for all these years
Ronaldo has been carrying Portugal for last 4 world cups.. so why u hating for no reason??
people who say Portugal needs Ronaldo are anti-Portugal 😂😂
Ronaldo makes such a huge impact on the pitch even if he doesn’t score.
Ronaldo scores those same goals lol
Portugal will need Ronaldo if it goes to penalties. So he will be coming in as a sub if they don't have a comforrable lead by 60 min I guess.
Which Ramos is better at the world cup? Sergio Ramos (Spain) vs Goncalo Ramos (Portugal)
go back to making Swiss knives and being neutral
Portugal played good, but let's not forget that Switzerland is not France or Brazil. Of course they will need Ronaldo in his best shape for the next games
Swiss goalie was useless. Great game from Ramos!
Hit the Griddy  👌👁👁👌
Please Perez sign Goncalo Ramos in January!!!!
What the fuuc Switzerland?
Estaba jugando con inválidos jjjj,
Same thing happen, Like Korea Swiss was Drained from thier last group match and everyone looks so tired,  couldnt believe its same team against Brazil week ago
That's what you get for being a whiny liar, Ronaldo.
Ronaldo washed Messi better
Bruh Switzerlands goalie sleeping Fr💀
pepe wins
Ramos didn’t prepare enough gol celebrations😂
Now all the ronaldo haters gonna say portugal dont need cr7 haha if cr7 never existed this team wouldn't be on this level. Either way we'll see when they face stronger teams like france and brazil, even Morocco
Spain! Oh wait 💀
so since Messi would absolutely never get benched for a match like this the debate is over right? 😂
Waited a long long time to see such a performance from Portugal in World Cup
They will lose against 🇲🇦💯😂
I’m Mexican but let’s go Portugal be a champion good luck;)
Feels like a great "passing of the torch"
Messi wherever you are please show Ronaldo how to play so he can stop warming up the bench and could play a couple minutes
Don't know what to say!
Ronaldo Messi Neymar Jr love this 3 players man am Mexican but if any of this 3 takes the world cup I'll be happy
I'm so happy with al Portuguese fans. . Great performance of a focus team... I'm happy with CR7 too..  putting beside any distraction and supporting his team mates...
Can you guys upload in higher video quality like 1080p?
afro or no afro hair, PEPE IS COLD
Wow half of dozen goals.. Nice
0:52
Switzerland is a good team, a GGooodd team very very solid team,  so I just never saw this coming. I even thought Swiss has a very good chance of winning   Is this the same team that played and lost to Korea last? Really?  Phenomenal performance, Wow.... This game was something.... Time for Ronaldo to retire
7 goals in this game, and I swear we spent just as much time on all of them combined as we did watching Ronaldo on the bench. Pretty lame that’s where the focus is
Where's the girl named  #ronaldo 🤡
Leao doing the griddy dance is so funny to see. Justin Jefferson celebration made it from American football to football/soccer as well lol
Hope he'll not be a one match wonder 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Cr7 punching the air after the hat trick .
Ramos had an absolutely insane game
wont happen against morocco .
PENALDO IS DONE!
“The old man gets his goal”🦗 🦗🦗🦗🦗
Why wasn’t Ronaldo starting ?
why was ronaldo benched?
A subs bib? Tell me you hate Ronaldo without telling me you hate Ronaldo. These commentators are super jealous, they dont even try to hide it anymore... smh
Congrats!! Portugal, what an amazing performance 🎉
From my time playing rec and club soccer, I can safely say that if the defense is really bad, anyone can score. If the defense is really good, sometimes it take a special playr to break through. Does Portugal need Ronaldo? We will see won't we, when they face a tougher defense. Wait.. Morocco is around the corner.
good
Goal keeper was so suck
Seems like every time Ronaldo's on the bench in international games, they win.
This has to be the event that turns the page on Ronaldo's career and that's ok. I will say I'm very proud of Pepe despite being a Barca fan myself. He still has quality.
Portugal manager called Man United Erik ten Hag asked him how to better use Ronaldo. Ten Hag: bench Ronaldo😀
I’m Messi over Ronald. You guys need to chill. It’s a decent Swiss side. Not France, England, or Brazil. He is being rested. He’s old. It’s ok. He will play the last 3 games. (If they make it) Swiss is the weakest opponent they have left to play. He could have had a hat trick too . Resting rn was the best call.
Great game. Can't wait for the final. Remember us 4 current fashion trend and style.
Siuuuuuuuuuuu
The Portugal team won a game with grace.
머선일이고 브라질이랑 할때 스코어는 양호한 거였네
That first goal might be better than Richarlison
Holly goals
Suuuuuui
guy needs to holster those weapons.
Portugal great victory, you will do good and you can make history. Good luck, love Portugal.
"OLD MAN GETS HIS GOAL" DISCRIMINATING SOMEONES AGE ?
Does the kid Ramos have more World Cup goals than Ronaldo????
Pepe scores  Presenter: “THE OLD MAN GETS HIS GOAL!” 😂
Joao Felix may be one of the cheekiest players ever, his plays are incredible.
Must be one of the heaviest round of 16 defeats ever.
JOHN STRONG IS THE GOAT WORST COMMENTATOR. THERE IS LITERALLY A REDIT  POST SAYING HOW AFUL THIS GUY IS !
Look, Pepe got no hair but he scored with his head, his teammate meanwhile tried to claim he scored with his hair...
Did anyone else notice Monaco 🇲🇨 goalkeeper ❤
I can't believe they didn't show the amazing buildup of the 4th goal.
The Swiss, like their cheese, had holes in the defense!
How did Switzerland get to the round of 16?
You have to realize that CR7 is always guarded by two defenders at all times. This time Switzerland didn’t know who was going to strike for goal.
bravo morocco!!! bien jugado!!!!
Everything from that first goal screams fifa 😂 from rocket to the first post to the jumping over the corner flag celebration 💀
Ronaldo just wants Portugal to win. He loves his country and I respect him for supporting how ever he can. Go Portugal!
1:38 'The old man get his goal' LOL
Whoa. Okay, Portugal. We see you. (These entire squads, esp nations like Portugal, Brazil, etc, are ALL top-tier players... starters, subs, doesn't matter. And this match proves that.)
Portugal is doing great
I am pretty sure Raffael Leao had green time finishing turned on for the last goal
My heart goes out to all the Swiss fans. Seeing the US lose to the Netherlands the other day had me really bummed. Hate seeing good teams like Japan and Switzerland get knocked out. I'm really rooting for an underdog to take the Cup this year
Props to CR for putting Team before himself 👍👍
I'm glad Santos took the high road and benched Ronaldo. Ramos shined in his first start for his country in the grandest of stages. Maybe we're seeing CR7's successor in real-time
He is too good when he was young but now I think Portugal don’t really need him. He is old right now and also he doesn’t have power like before.
Everyone trashing Ronaldo remember Ronaldo carried Portugal ast world cup against Spain an even harder team
Ahh Fox commentators never disappoint. Didn't know this turned into Brazil v Switzerland (3:34-3-40) half way into the game. What an embarrassing collection of clowns they have commentating on games. https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/05/fox-sports-us-world-cup-coverage-tv-soccer
speed will see him someday
Man Portugal just thrashed the Swiss!!
Looking forward to Morocco V Portugal - battle of Christmas! =P
Team player what a joke he is 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
The disrespect!! I could imagine what Ronaldo would have done if he'd a gotten the start he deserved.  Switzerland was so bad they let a defensive man and a sub score like that SMH.  I feel for Ronaldo man
Horrible annoying commentators
Bruno Fernandes is my player of the tournament so far.
See how much better they do without Ronaldo. He just needs to retire already.
Switzerland goal keeper be like after losing 6-1🥵
After the team has done 5 gols why send in Ronaldo? Jealousy? 😂 keep Ronaldo on the bench the team did really well without him! 😅😅😅😅😅
Watch very closely how Cristiano Ronaldo reacts to other players score, very indifferent. Cristiano fared terribly in 2022, he showed his true color, after all he has landed on a 500 million Dollar contract, why should he care about Portugal
Better than CR7
It’s seems Portuguese players are tired of Ronaldo .
did they rest ronaldo because he's washed or because they didn't need him because switzerland is a joke?  I don't know i don't really follow soccer i just know messi and ronaldo are supposed to be the best.
Leao doing the griddy
Lol, Leao's team mate interrupted his Griddy after his goal...
Goale zuc az
I think they need Ronaldo
The World Cup is about who is the best team not who has that “chosen one” player, and they clearly showed here that they are a really strong team even if CR7 doesn’t play, NOW THATS WHAT YOU CALL A TEAM 🔥
The swiss keeper was just not in the game
Why was Ronaldo sitting out?
WY to go Por
Also, was it me or did Ronaldo seem salty?
If Ronaldo had that ball at 54:50 it would’ve been still 3-0…
Did they play better without Ronaldo?
Send ronaldo home Portugal don't need him.
The worst goal keeper. I am definitely better.🤣
Best player not playing,
These highlights are subpar. Don’t even show the goals’ build up.
This game clearly showed that the team does not need CR. They are strong enough to do the job by themselves
Portugal might actually win the cup... they really could have sat ronaldo in this game to relax
I don't like this for some reason
Haha, swiss cannot play this game... go home swiss
If Portugal maintains this form, they can win the World Cup
Cristiano Ronaodo
portugues x portugues na final da copa do mundo a hegemonia
But when Ronaldo plays they don’t pass balls to him like this 🤣
no ronaldo, portugal dominates. *pretends to be shocked*
Haters were crying for Ronaldo to act up for being benched. Instead, he celebrated with his teammates and applauded the fans🤫. Further shows Ten Hag really disrespected him during that preseason period causing their relationship to break down
Portugal wants it.
pls, por win. arg would be ok too. one of the goats needs a world cup. i hope england can eliminate france
Portugal 🇵🇹 scored 5 goals  with Cr7 on the bench  and when he subs in the team scored another 1 to sealed the game on the other hand 🇨🇭 couldn't Stop ramos but they did things that other big names in soccer history couldn't make..
When Ronaldo is in, it’s about him. When Ronaldo is out it’s about the team. Bench him for the rest of the WC!
We can safely say Ronaldo is not playing again in the WC
Switzerland never did a play with no defense
Portugal is better
3:36 calling Portuguese brazilians 😂
Do you want to have a relationship with someone who loves you beyond any other love. Someone who sacrificed himself for you and everyone on this Earth the one who created the heavens and the Earth be creator of everything do you want to be saved Do you want eternal life with peace and joy forever your answer is Jesus if you do not know who Jesus is read the following Jesus is the Son of God that came to this Earth to save the people of their sins. when God-created Earth sin same came into Earth and tempted Eve(The first woman) to eat the fruit that God had forbidden her and Adam to not eat. If they do, they will die. Not immediately  but death is certain. Eve ate the fruit and gave Adam some to eat as well. And he did. That showed that humans are sinners and not perfect. That is why Jesus came to Earth to save humans of their sins. Which leads to a relationship with God(the main reason) and eternal life. He did that by dieing on the cross. 3 days later he resurrected. The story of Jesus is beautiful. If you do not already have a Bible, purchase one. If you do not have the money, pray to God about you wanting a Bible and if he could please provide one for you. Thus does not mean a Bible will come from the sky and land on your hands. Pray to God everyday. But to not be blabbering that just say a bunch words to try to impress and show off to other people or to impress God. A few words out of the heart is better than saying a bunch words to impress and not mean. This does not mean praying long prayers is bad. Acts 16:31 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved- you and your household." H Jesus Loves his Children ❤️
Of course, rest your best player if you can...
Goalkeeper’s performance of Switzerland is a disaster.
Switzerland had KOBEL 😡 Sommer was bad
Ronaldo on the bench? He belongs behind bars.
It sucks but we already saw the last game of CR7 with Portugal and we just didnt know it
Griddy at the WC is crazy
U mean to tell me we should have signed Ramos over Nunez??
The hate towards Cristiano is unbelievable. If Ramos does that for the next ten years, then he can be compared to Cristiano. Other than that, good luck meeting those expectations.
Arteta needs to pick up Ramos
Ronaldo on the bench "I am SO happy for you, Ramos 😡"  International career ender haha.
Amazing game
Geez, they may want to save some for their next game.
100m incoming for benfica 😂
Os tugas foram muito perigosos no campo sem “O Capitão”. 😮😮
Who cares if Ronaldo didn’t score or start he’s done so much for Portugal 🇵🇹 it’s about time they do something for him 💪🏻 we should just be happy about Portugal in general
This goal keeper is the exact opposite of the Moroccan goal keep. Sheesh.
This is the worst thing that can ever happen to Ronaldo. They score the most goals when he is not in lineup 😂
Well they just proved Portugal doesn’t need Ronaldo on the field to win!
Portugal doesn't need CR as much as before.
1:57 what a hard-working cheerful chap on Portugal’s construction crew, hope he’s being paid a living wage
Portugal England France Brazil are stacked with young talent 😮 What a year for this World Cup
This was the game that will down in history where Ronaldo passed down the torch to the next generation of Portugal players. Ramos should that he can be that leading man on the team. A sad day in soccer history but a bright glimpse into the future of Portuguese soccer
I think Swiss goalie was having a bad day today.
Why did Ronaldo not start?????
Fantastic plays moving forward and having enough space to take their shot on goal.
Ok who’s gonna win Portugal or Morocco?
Swiss defence looking a lot like their cheese tonight
OMG .... could not believer that Portugal Team seems like superman .... everyone player can get the point. Portugal seem can win this year of World Cup because everyone have a passion!!! Good Luck of rest of games.
Switzerland never played a good soccer game ❤. Anyone can beat them.
Goncalo Ramos can sign for any big team!!! Portugal proved that their winning the wc. 🇵🇹 well done Performance. They completely obliterated Switzerland.
Brazil vs Portugal final, imo
How is 39 year old Pepe is an old man now?
Portugal literally said load management
Portugal champs calling it rn 🔥🔥🔥🌎
Felix and Bernardo did a great job today. Not enough credit from the announcers..
Come on! It’s just Swiss which play like Swiss cheese full of holes. The real test is the semi final vs England or France
At 2:54 Ramos makes the obvious, and prompt pass to the left giving Guerreiro lots of time to line up his shot. If that's Ronaldo in the middle and not Ramos do you think he gives the ball up so soon, and delivers it so well? Just asking, for a friend.
Ronaldo needs a vacation
Portugal can be 4th or 3rd place
Portugal did great
Proof that Ronaldonis not needed.
Good things happen when you bench that narcissist Ronaldo!
Ronaldo didn’t have to be in full time 😎🔥🇵🇹
I guess my least favorite team might win this year.
Ouch!!
39 yr old Pepe got vertical, WOW
Ramos has more knockout stage goals than both Ronaldo and Messi combined.
Suiiiiii vs Sui
Mexico or canada should have replaced switzerland im sure they would have lost too but not by that much 😂
Cristiano Ronaldo being dropped was the best thing that could've happened to the Portuguese today. I'm flabbergasted by no TC being outright oblivious on here, not much so with FOX "Soccer" asking the stupid a-- question. Portugal's attack is lethargic when Cristiano is the focal point, it's not aided by Fernando Santos' tactics either. I'm very glad for the Portuguese fans today, I wish you guys success in the next match(es)
Lazy goali for sweden
Imagine a team having cr7 and Raphael leao on the bench and still be so good they don’t even need them
There are only two types of player-those who keep their nerves under control and win championships and those who do not. ----Harry Vardon---
Look at Ronaldo's face at 1:29 He looks sad instead of being happy for his team following the 1-st goal. If you had begun watching the video from 1:29, you would have thought Switzerland had scored a goal!!!!
Why can't Ronaldo be nice ? Very selfish.  His teammates are happy look at them!! Why would anybody want to play with selfish player. .. its a team sport.
Did that dude just call them brazilians? 3:36
Where was Cancelo? Injured? Can't imagine him not starting.
The camera panning to Ronaldo every goal is insane 😭
I want a Argentina vs Portugal match but I think it’ll be England vs Brazil
🇵🇹🔥🔥🔥🔫
Where #ishowspeed?
Bittersweet day for Ronaldo. Portugal's greatest victory in the world cup and Ronaldo is on the bench most of the game.  I'd say the young portuguese players are performing better trying to create a push together than creating a play for Ronaldo.  If they keep this performance Portugal will beat Morocco in the quarter finals and has a chance against England or France in the Semi-finals.
I didn’t watch the game, and the video doesn’t explain.  Why did Ronaldo not start this game?
Dude what is the attitude of purposefully sitting one of your best players just to see if he gets upset or not. Dude their is media blitz against ronaldo..
Why was Ronaldo benched?
Can’t wait for Brazil vs Portugal
_switzerland  keep your legs wide opened like the mouth of your leaders.
The sui for Swiss team lol ishowspeed
Ronaldo hasn't been a team player since he was 27
Swiss had one of the worst goalkeepers!
someone give ramos a new celebration
WOW!!! This is was the performance of a world-champion team!! They absolutely have what it takes to take the cup!!!
Repeat of Germany V Brazil from 2014. Just destroyed
Fox soccer y’all are terrible, talking about would he sulk and he’s being a team player at this moment. Y’all some real haters over there. Portugal had a great game today, so what Ronaldo didn’t play. Who cares, the media is making all this about Ronaldo. This was a great game and showed how strong this side is. Ronaldo will eventually play, he’s one of the greats of football.🤫
By far portugals best game of the tourney. I was really questioning them before the game but they looked like a new side tonight. Constantly attacking and taking advantage of the opportunities they made.
Wow they played way better without CR7.
That first goal was so powerful even slow mo cant make it look slow
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesshhhhhh
beautiful
The goalkeeper from Switzerland seems like he let them score on purpose.
Leao doing the griddy 😂😂😂😂
If Ronaldo had started he'd have scored for sure in a match as opened as this, bad luck he was on the bench .  Ramos was a BEAST tho .
the old man is crazy
Everyone: Ronaldo’s goal was an offside! Don’t allow it! *meanwhile at **3:52** G. Ramos scores an offside goal with everybody congratulating him*
Leao 🐐
And even after Ronaldo get on the field, he barely looks happy after the 6th goal or at the end of the video?? How can he not be ecstatic for his country. He always has an attitude and sulks when things don’t go his way.
fifa sucks
Ronaldo is finished. Portugal don't need him. 5 goals without him in game only one with him in the game. He makes no difference😂
Pepe is so good. He is underappreciated legend of those Real Madrid teams
Which team can win the World Cup?
Ramos come to Bayern 🫶🏼
CR7s FINISHED U KNOW. 🤣🤣🤣
No point for putting Ronaldo at the end
Portugal B team > Switzerland A team
Swiss Watch
Swiss goal keeper the worst in tournament
The griddy 👀 surprised to see that here in football ⚽️
We can acknowledge the passing of the torch while still giving Ronaldo his flowers.  All I know - this last 8 is going to be amazing.  Every matchup this Friday and Saturday is 🔥.  Pumped 💪
They dropped Ronaldo and it helped a lot 👏
Ramos should start from on!
STOP THE SCORING SUMMARY SPOILERS !!
Kakav potop swice gore nego titanic
Don't feel bad Ronaldo, you are my hero, just stay there for your country.
After sitting on the bench almost entire game. Ronaldo: I don’t have respect to Portugal coach. Portugal disrespected me.
Left wing Left foot, two touch
Great finishing...goals wins matches
I dunno that much about soccer, but was that Swiss goalie a bit substandard? Especially at 4:31. Never seen anything quite like it.
Leao is a beast, he should be first forward off bench
The coach must be racist not to let top 3 players in the world Leao not starting.
This truly was a sight to behold.
"The old man gets his goal! 💀💀💀
What is that song people are chanting at the start? The woooaah, woaooah??
Wait why did Ronaldo come off the bench?
It’s only fair, Ronaldo carried them for so long
Ronaldo came in thinking he was going to score another 3 :)
Hey Fox Sports / Soccer! You had Derek Rae but decided to go with John Strong and Stu Holden? Why oh WHY???????
Waiting for Man U 150m offer for Ramos. 🤣🤣
It doesn't show but Ronaldo did not celebrate the victory with the rest of the team .. he really is retiring from professional football with a bad reputation.
These replays spend way more time showing the celebrations than showing the plays or the goals. 🤣
Portugal before were carried by Ronaldo now Ronaldo is getting carried by Portugal
Portugal played so clean and efficient.  Unbelievable.
Ronaldo retiring is getting closer and closer.
Not enough goals. Portugal could have scored another 3 goals easy.
Let's be honest here. Portugal played extremely well but the Swiss defense and GK absolutely collapsed and were a complete shambles.  Not sure why Switzerland struggled so much against Portugal. They should have watched tape of Korea's victory and learned how it's done.
The Swiss should have played Portugal like they played Brazil, 11 man behind the ball and try their luck in a shootout. They were way too exposed in the back and I don't think their goalkeeper came to play. smdh
GOOD JOB FOR COACH TO BENCH CR7 CUZ THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE TO WIN JUST LIKE EURO 16 LOOL
Ramos  R26
LES GO PORTUGAL!! why did I find funny :Por vs "SUI" at the beginning
Does Ronaldo not start next game? 🤔
This is brutal!
In your face FIFA President!!!!! Your dirty little tricks won't work this time😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Imagine being told to sit this one out  to make way for a rising star.
Ronaldo should just sit this one out! They don't need him LOL
Can’t believe we are questioning Ronaldo’s place in the team. The Portugal team surprised Switzerland by benching him. Swiz team has prepared to defend against CR7 and G. Ramos is the out-of-syllabus question for them. I still believe CR7 is a real threat. Respect his hard work on and off the field. It's not easy to stay at his level consistently over the years.
“Brazilians challenging for it” ??😂
No Sui against Sui? :(
You Ronaldo score every goal with as many time they showed him lol
Love 7
Substituted Ronaldo for saved main players stamina. It seems to be advantageous in the round of 8
Looks like for the next match in the bracket we'll have the irresistible force (Portugal's offense) vs. the immovable object (Morocco's defense).
FORÇA PORTUGAL!!!!!!! 🇵🇹 🇵🇹
I'm rooting for Portugal only because of the fact their coach had the Balls to bench Ronaldo. This is how coaches should make decisions and not let these arrogant millionaires dictate how things should be done.
Let's  see if ramos.dooes this next match.  They are gonna cry for ronaldo to get in
Portugal always love 😘❤️
Swiss cheese defense.
Ronaldo wants to win this WC.. as sub or striker whatever, he just needs to support the country. Probably they’l win it.
when switzerland scored one goal, the guy did not show any positive emotion....
Does this mean there going to play Morocco next ? If so there done then!
You can see the lack of deep joy for Ronaldo...being a fierce competitor AND wanting to be the main reason your team wins also means it's hard to enjoy your team's success if you personally didn't have anything to do with it.  Hopefully he finds joy in his country's victory even if it doesn't involve his direct contribution.  This is why balance is so important...and why his 'nemesis' the GOAT is celebrated all the more because that other guy GENUINELY enjoys his team's success even if he didn't directly contribute. He celebrates every assist he ever received WITH the teammate that assisted him and he celebrates every goal together with his teammates with or without being involved in the play that led to it.  #Messi #Ronaldo #DifferentMindsets #LegendaryPlayers
Great decision by Portugal’s coach👍👍
POR vs SUI Ronaldo: No chance to do SUI!!!!!!!!!!
Portugal learning with Brazil 😂
3:34 “two Brazilians”  bruh 😂
Does anyone know why Ronaldo didn’t start? Then when Portugal was up like 4:0 when he was actually not needed, they put him in the game. I don’t understand the logic, can someone explain thanks.
3 of those 6 goals was thanks to the Switzerland 🇨🇭 defense honestly
Crowd: YAAH GOAL  Ramos: i have a gun
The goal tender should find a new line of work, I think I could do better.
why do people keep mentioning a single player name, out of 11, to be the star? when ALL OF them ave to work together?? explain to me, please!!
Good
I think koreans are lucky to beat them on last Friday. Wow Portugal 🇵🇹was much stronger than i ever thought.
Ramos is a gunslinger indeed 👏🏼 what a performance
Anyone else notice the sub get pushed in the celebration and come back with the fist? 🧐 😂
incredible hat-trick by Ramos, what a display!
switzerland, power to be a hold of !!
What a beatdown by Portugal! So impressive!!
Why are the goal celebrations longer than the actual highlights of the game? I don't care how they celebrate, just show us how they played.
Another Germany vs Brazil game
Ronaldo who?
Portugal don't need no-show thief Ronaldo.  I never saw anyone so selfish in football in my life.
Was Switzerland trolling the entire match 😱 what a joke 💩👎
Bro is actually finished 😂😂😂
Goncalo Ramos deserve more tha $200 M
El bicho no hizo nada.
Is it just me or is Portugal performing better withOUT Ronaldo?  🧐🧐
CR7 still the goat
Waste of time
Portugal looks better without Ronaldo to be honest
@ 3:36 did the commentator say Brazilians ??😂
what is this video quality? 2022 btw
'm not sure, maybe check the replay, but I think Ronaldo scored the first and second goal. Even more amazing, from the bench.
More time spent showing the lineups and the celebrations than the actual game. These highlights are pathetic.
SUI goalie gave up after second goals
Did anyone not see this coming? … really?
Great game 👍😉🏆🤍
Ronaldo will buy portugal fc so yes we need him lol
SUIIIIIIIIIIII!!!
Ronaldo didn't even run but looked exhausted😂
Keep Ronaldo on the bench, where he belongs!
I CANT REMEMBER A MORE EXCITING WORLD CUP.  LOVING EVERY MOMENT OF IT.
Ronald mad that he didn’t get any goals 💀
Even when CR7 doesnt score he is the storey!!! Of cors they need him!!! Better the whole team plays great than just CR7! Go Portugal!!!
People forget that Portugal didn't have a solid team through 4 world cups when Ronaldo played through a couple of decades. Portugal has more talent now than ever before which is great. Don't forget one man has carried a team for some time.
Wait to represent a Portugal!!
Fué un gran insulto de parte de este coach del equipo de Portugal de poner a Christiano Ronaldo, respetado por el público, en los últimos 15 minutos del juego, a pesar de la aclamación del público  en el estadio; se sintió  su acción intencional, para humillarle en público y con su equipo. En el juego anterior lo sacó  la segunda mitad del juego y afectó ese tiempo del juego. Parece ser que este coach no acepta o no quiere a Christiano en su equipo, pues sus acciones hablan por él.
Gonçalo Ramos was unheard of, and put on a hat trick today. Portugal all the way!
It must feel strange for cr not to start … age catches with everyone even if you are cr
What is the intro song around 0:20?
american football narrators are so boring
Crazy when cr7 say that portugal is more difficult  to carry than argentina  or Brazil
Imagine thinking Ronaldo has to carry every single game. Lmaoo cut the guy some slack this dude has done so much for every team his played in. Y’all just pressed pessi fans 💀
When u don't practice any other celebrations so u spam the same one 3 times
Manchester city right now e👀👀👀
Never thought id see the day when Pepe is a starter and CR7 is NOT for Portugal...
3:36 "BRAZILIANS CHALLENGING" it's Portugal my man
Speeeeeed!!
Incredible. Wow!
CR7 get dropped..United starts playing well CR7 get dropped.. Portugal scores loads of goals.  hmmm...
Portugal seems to play better without Ronaldo
Unbelievable what a game 🎉👍👌
Makes absolute sense for Portugal to invest on young players that can play throughout the years and not on a has been player that is continually showing degradation in skills and eventually have to retire in a few years.
Portugal ran riot
The coach was right… and why in the f you don’t show a reply of Leao goal?
Even though that was a minor loss, Switzerland’s fans had a neutral reaction - their nations policy dictates neutrality.
💕🇺🇸👍👍👍
So CR7 was on the bench.  Piers Morgan must hear this.
Brazil vs France ? Whose gonna win?
Some great goals but the keeper was not the best
This is what you call a Massacre
Ouch
Star of the game was the Swiss goalkeeper ⭐️
Benfica.  Breeding stars.    With Morocco beating Spain.  This is getting close to cristiano going to final.   Argentina lucked out with Australia but Netherlands are gonna be too much for them.
How did we win against Portugal???
Chrismas Sale. Ronaldo 75% off hurry hurry..
Swiss saved korea lol ty Switzerland
Portugal can win whether there is no Ronaldo
Love Portugal from Iran ♥️🇮🇷
Either Portugal is very which I don't think they are or Switzerland is very bad
Any game can be his last game. Any minute can be his last minute.
Ronaldo is just one man, if Portugal continue playing like this they will win it all.
🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🔥🔥🔥
Portugal vs Argentina smells like it they wanna know who’s the best Messi vs Ronaldo .
Portugal:4 Morocco:1 I bet 80k
Usually an big win followed by a big loss. Portugal please remain calm and focus.
Well we know now that Portugal doesn’t need Ronaldo anymore🤣
Seems Portugal planned to take advantage of Sommers lack of height, he’s only 6’0 and when he’s crouched he leaves a lot of space overhead
Raphael Leao  🔥
Massacre
U cant help but smile when Pepe scored that header
Wow. Ronaldo played incredibly today on a bench
Fernando Santos got it right today.
If Portugal wants to advance to the Finals they need to bench Christiano, they play much better without him. Look at the statistics.
"The old man gets his goal!" if anything the commentator's older
This is just a beginner luck without Ronaldo. Don’t forget who got portugal in the World Cup at first place.
will Sommer retire?
I’m not saying Portugal needs Ronaldo but they play well without him
wnd they blamed on ten hag banned cr7 😆
I love how the camera keeps showing Ronaldo even though he didn't do anything
He took away CR powers 😂
We’re getting closer and closer to seeing Argentina🇦🇷 vs Portugal🇵🇹  That will be the match of history‼️ If the odds come through 🤞🏽😁🤚🏽
Bye Swis( Albanian ) go cry 😢 😭
First goal was really good/lucky?
3:36 2 Brazilians?
3:37 my guy said two Brazilians challenging for it? Bro Brazil not playing in this game.
I felt bad for CR7 when he sat on the bench most of the time. It looks he is no longer an important captain of Portugal team.
Que merda
I see he did not Knowledge the little kids! Not cool at all...Cristiano
Who needs Ronaldo...?
Switzerlands defense was very questionable.
Hey now Ronaldo is still the best player that came out of Portugal respect. Kudos to Portugal. Swiss what happened? 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
You guys are ungrateful to C.R7 remember all what he does back then Before this new player despite is selfish playing of ball game he play is all out for every team he join ,human proven so many time that they can’t be please  . If they should go final and score the winning goal I would love to see you under the comment section again 🤦‍♀️
Anyone notice that switzerland's abbreviation is SUI, what ronaldo celebrates every time lmao SUIIIII
the goaltender went down when the shot was going up high ! this is comedy ! lmao
Notice how the biggest cheer was when your boy Ronaldo stepped on the field.
Ronaldo wanted to be the hero in this game. But realized that his presence wasn't needed at all. He didn't have to come in the game.
Portugal is sailing!
Another reminder of Justin jefferson having the most popular celebration of all time
Yes Portugal 🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
It's funny 😄  Ronaldo's teammate scored, yet the camera will be facing Ronaldo
why didn't Ronaldo start?
Never thought I'd see the day Ronaldo would get benched before almost 40 year old Pepe
Portugal just being bullies at this point.
Hit em with that griddy🥶
Ronaldo won’t be starting in the World Cup anymore after todays game!
Portugal won, They strong it's OK but Switerland goalkeeper was bad .
Wow I thought we had it bad with 4:1...
CR7 is the GOAT. It’s great to know the New Generation will be strong after his retirement.
Yes, Portugal play as a team - that makes the difference!  2nd and 3rd are so classic football  4th and 5th - I ❤ them; proof of team play  (1st and 6th are excellent understanding of the situations and good precise individual performances)
Reminds me of Brazils 7-1 loss.
This was a training session for Portugal 🇵🇹
*Portugal may have peaked a little too early. I am backing Morocco now.*
Why didn’t the defender block the first goal
lol some fine goal keeping right there
Ramos has to start next game. Ronaldo can be the supersub. Imagine if this team had a healthy Diogo Jota to add to the attack? Portugal looking like they want to win the Copa
Vamos!!!
For me, since the beginning I though that Portugal could win this whole thing. They are strong in defense, midfield and forward. Their midfield is fantastic Joao Felix, Fernandes, and my favorite guy Bernardo Sylva will make a difference against any team. Now with Ramos, they are really scary.
Beat Morocco and see what happens….  Let’s go PORTUGAL!!!!!
💪🇧🇫
With Spain going home, their neighbor Portugal just made an argument that Portugal is the favorite. Over Brazil! Over Argentina!  This World Cup has gotten very competitive, very quickly.
💪🟢🔴
I know speed is there
That goalkeeper just seemed gunshy... he's flinching when shot upon. Then again... his defenders are not doing him any favors..  HUP HUP HOLLAND!!!
In the debate between Ronaldo and Messi, Messi wins
Give this man a raise! What a start!!
Bye 🇨🇭
All I’m saying is…
After the second goal, we already saying “Goodbye” to Switzerland 🇨🇭👋🏽😄
Is Manchester united watching Goncalo ramos
BRAVO PORTUGAL !!! Serbian fan
Portugal is on fire, hope they can bring it home 🏆
Question is; can Ramos play the same two games in a row.?
The Switzerland goalkeeper is useless
Why is the camera man in love with ronaldo
I love how Switzerland's abbreviation is Sui, kinda similar to Siuuuuu!
Coach: “Are we gonna need Ronaldo?”  Team: “Na, u can keep him as waterboy” 😂🤣😂
Wow, Ramos just killed Brand Ronaldo single handedly.
Well now Portugal can win the world cup that the headache has finally given the coach oppertunity to drop him
impressive hes right footed and still took the second goal also with his left
Portugal looking scary
Fox got some horrible highlights edits considering they do the epl ones which are a lot better
Bruh Ronaldo hasn’t done anything this World Cup :(
Will they still play Ronaldo for the next match, or will they keep Ramos?
Portugal be like “No Ronaldo needed” 👌🏽
Line up
Create space
Switzerland sucks..how did they even advance to the KO round?? Smh…
Cristiano is past of his prime. Portugal is on fire!
The Switzerland goalie usually this bad? He was horrible this game.
First goal was outstanding. Hopefully they make it to the final.
Oof
Man what a day for that goalie he was magnificent
Ronaldo too heavy, needs to get carried
PORTUGAL Vs FRANCE 😉
Ronaldo will be rested for the next round. Genius move.
The Bigger the score, the bigger Ronaldo's  disappointment !! 🤣🤣🤣
CR es el pasado. Viejo.
TOO MUCH...................
Beautiful play.  Beautiful game
muchas gracias aficiones. este para vosotros SIIIIUUUUUUUUUU
Looks like the team was kinda of easy to beat probably
Ronaldo is out of the goat conversation now
Who needs Renaldo anyway, when you have Pepe & Ramos.
Everyone in America was at work and like “now it’s 4-1, 5-1, 6-1”
Aww offside as always 🤣🤣🤣
3:54 - when you're up 5 to 1 but still need external validation so you celly 😱
Really proud of Korea for beating Portugal 2-1  Portugal is a beast!!
They make it look so easy
Glad see g.romaos geting his due dudes a baller ! And should done been a superstar
Vamos portugal 🇵🇹
Portugal play better without CR7
This is considered a blowout in soccer. Makes you wonder if Switzerland was even that good or prepared
Give us extended highlights
Ronaldo was holding them back tbh, I say hes better as a super sub type player
that 6th goal, the goalie just gave up ...
Sommer was god awful. Several of those goals were 100% savable and should've been stopped. Any other quality keeper would've had them. He regularly dropped to the ground when shots were going high/overhead. As a keeper you're to react to the ball, not just go where you think it's going to go and hope for the best. He's the reason it was such a blowout.
Morocco is scared
Ramos goal I think may beat out Richarlison's scissor for goal of tournament... so far
when they won Euro 2016 they didn't need Cristiano Ronaldo and now it's more than proven that they didn't need it in this World Cup either
Wow the final 8 teams all look dangerous
Ronaldo is a legend, but he has been soiling it this past few months.  Good luck in KSA, mercenary
Portugal played so well. Although I’m happy they’ve won I feel very sad seeing Ronaldo declining. It’s his age. He is not ready to accept it or maybe mentally he’s still being plagued by the events that have happened recently in his life. I believe he’s gotten to an age where his body will not do what his mind and instincts say to do. Many of you out there hate him simply because he rivals messi and I really don’t care what you guys have to say because you’re not true football fans. It’s a sad reality. Our Legends have one thing they can’t beat. Time. This may be his last World Cup. Im hoping Im wrong and he’s just in a rut.
See the penaldo looks better in the bench....like in M United....cause penaldo no penalty no party
Waooo, what a statement to qfinal opponent by Portugal 🇵🇹 https://youtu.be/cIojHCFNKlY  The 2nd Cleansing of the Sanctuary by Christ
Can someone explain to me why Ronaldo isn’t starting? Is he washed up?
All those years Ronaldo carrying Portugal and now they will cary him and win him the World Cup ;)
Proud of Portugal 🇵🇹!!! Great game!!!!!!!
Why does ramos look like a default fifa player??
Why do cameras keep showing Ronaldo not scorers.
7
t
Ronaldo is holding back Portugal.... Fact
There’s a certain style of cheese famous for having a lot of holes, but I’m not sure which country it’s made in; but anyway, the Swiss defense was kind of like that cheese.
Oh oh
Pepe getting his goal is heart warming
The Portugal coach might just be coach of the tournament with that switch.
Wow, Portugal is making me afraid 😳  Parabens, Portugal!!!
Portugal beat the NON-SWISS
a team that has CR7 and Leao on the bench is surely a team that can win this world cup. Incredibly talented team.
the defense sucked
Ronaldo😍🇵🇹
@foxsoccer your highlight reels are poor... Why do you just show the close up of the goals and not the build up? Learn from other broadcasters sky, bbc, nbc... Also your commentators 🤦‍♂️
Ronaldo😍🇵🇹
The contept for Ronaldo is incredible
Why do they even pay Ronaldo for?
Its going to be messi vs ronaldo
Target practice. Wow!!
Speed was here!
Dalot with Man Utd: 🤡  Dalot with Portugal: 🤴🤴
I love Portugal
This is the same Santos who would have Pepe on the bench if Danilo didn’t get injured. Thankfully he did, Pepe is miles better
Ironically, Ramos missed his easiest chance of the day when one v one with Sommer. His first goal was well taken though
Ronaldo doesn't start and Portugal win 6-1.  Lol
I already know Ramos will start vs Morocco and do literally nothing
Portugal 🇵🇹 deserves this World Cup 🏆
Kanye is right about the Jews
Man I’m praying we get Messi vs Neymar and Mbappe vs Ronaldo in the semifinals and then everyone’s dream match in a World Cup final, Messi vs Ronaldo. The world would literally freeze for those 90 minutes of football to watch them settle who the Goat is of all time. I would not be upset seeing the other outcomes though, Messi vs Mbappe, Neymar vs Mbappe, Neymar vs Ronaldo, all of those sound just as exciting to me! 🔥🔥
Ramos stock is rising quickly
Suiii 6
Portugal vs England/France in the final. Portugal was always going to be better without Ronaldo, they have some great young strikers, Cristiano’s time is over.
I feel bad for ronaldo, but sometimes we need to be humbled down
squiptar go go home to yo mama
defender slipped up and just stood and watched Ramos give a two touch goal inside the area. No reaction on the touch to control the ball and shoot, there should have been more pressure he should not have had that much time to spin and score with his left. thats poor defending
Lol one game and all these clowns claim Portugal are definitively better without Ronaldo. That’s not how life works and definitely not evidence of such. Ramos played great but Switzerland were also awful. They won their group with Ronaldo starting and if anything I’d start CR7 and Ramos. Otavio is wasted in midfield.
Nobody is irreplaceable.
Rafael Leao needs to join Munich or City smh
00:54 poor guy
Swiss Cheese = Swiss Goalie
congratulations Portugal from a Dutchy!  🇳🇱 ❤🇵🇹
Switzerland goalkeeper def bet huge on losing this game
Real Madrid coming with a contract
Cr7 is done
lol, ronaldo being a sub is a highlight
Portuguese will not welcome in Switzerland😂😅
Portugal is win the game 👍
That Swiss keeper was atrocious 👎
Ronaldo has nothing to prove anymore, if he is still expected to be the starting goalscorer at his age then he really is the goat but nonetheless hopefully Portugal can keep going strong and win the World Cup even with Ronaldo on the bench
I think Morocco can put the clamps on Portugal, Switzerland is garbage on defense
I don't care how lethal Ronaldo used to be.  He could not have played the game Ramos did.  This kid is lethal.  You may not see Ronaldo for the rest of this tournament after that.
An easy win
Ronaldo hoping to get carried to another trophy XD
The Swiss should be ashamed of themselves , to go into this game and to let 6 pass them .Are Portugal that good?or are the Swiss that bad ?  Maybe they rolled over .
What kind of goalkeeper is that 😂
We are witnessing Ronaldo not been the guy they go for anymore 😢 it was a good run ❤
yo swiss goalie straight up sucks lmao
Hat-Trick goal was beautiful
Portugal made Swiss cheese out of their opponent's defense.
Ramos scored 3 and assisted for Portugal and for Switzerland what a player
Goalie thought they were playing dodgeball or what? 😂
World best players❤️🥹
It’s scary how good Portugal is playing. Leao who is barely playing but instantly makes a difference. To have a player like that on your bench is deadly
I feel they were playing by themselves.
If Ronaldo wants a trophy he’s gonna have to be cool with sitting on the bench
Embarrassing for Switzerland
See Ronaldo is never happy for a win unless he scores. He’s a great player but very self centered and egotistical. I’m starting to not like him very much now
LEAO FINISH IS 99
Premier Clubs lining up for Ramos!  Welcome to Wolverhampton!! 🐺
Being a Ronaldo fan It sucks to say he won't be starting after this game  All good tho So long as they get to that final and win !!!!! Siiiiuuuuuuu !!!!!
They need a striker with movement and that will rotate with Felix and any forward’s the front, in order to confuse the defence. With Cr7, he is a box CF and the CB’s will stay put
Portugal a la final Vamosss
Exactly how haaland started
Congrats to Portugal for scoring all the goals.
Portugal knew what they’re doing. Ronaldo was just resting for the next round.
Don't worry about Ronaldo. He will continue to collect a shitlord of money at Saudi's league, and live like a king.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been in five world cups he knows it's time for the new generation to shine.
When Portugal plays better without their captain cr7
Lalas has to be the worst commentator in all of football
Man United does better after benching Ronaldo Portugal does better after benching Ronaldo Anyone notice a trend here?
3:37 brazilian? lol
Look out WC, Portugal peaking at the right time!
Need to keep Benching Ronaldo. Ten Hag got hate for doing the same lol
And on that note guys , C Ronald’s career is over
Ronaldo should have started !!! switzerland sucks anybody could have hat tricked them
Why didn’t CR7 play someone explain?
João Félix was like prime kaka🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ronaldo needs Portugal more than Portugal needs Ronaldo
Either Switzerland was paid to lose, or they suck really bad. Their defense was super relaxed.
With out RONALDO Portuguese has excellent team.
Dam just i.agine how IShowSpeed reacted when ronaldo got subbed on. Haha
Swiss goalie MIA.
Pepe got fookin buddies 😭
Switzerland are going to need the red cross 🇨🇭
That was amazing Portugal teamwork.
Wow your highlights are seriously so bad… come on…
Was the Swiss goalkeeper high
As a Ronaldo fan I do believe that the team is dominating and competitive without him too. At this stage he is important to the team morally more than physically. Kudos to Portugal for the amazing win and I hope to see Ronaldo bouncing back in the up coming matches
Balkans lost to Portugal. It was expected.
Gotta speak portuguese to know how to put up a great show Brazil 4-1 Portugal 6-1
Жестко порвали их 👍
Ronaldo was the main reason they had hard games before lol😂
Can Stu Holden shut up for life, pls!
Ronaldo should retire after this series. Portugal played like champions without him.
Why doesn’t Leao start?
Ronaldo deciding if he should score on portugal
Portugal -- should go final !!
Props to Portugal, a complete game all-around, but a disastrous showing form Switzerland. The Swiss appear to be the USA equivalent of Europe in the sense that they can dominate the minnows they play to be able to qualify and even advance out of group stage, but are still very far away from giving a sense that they can really compete with the elite teams of Europe and South America.
"sui"
Que asco 🤮 como jugo Switzerland wow nose colo que llegaron a octavos chalesss
Bunch of immatures in Comment Section
The moral of the game .. Christian Ronaldo is moving to a Middle East Club ;).
What’s up with people hating on Ronaldo? They even hate on him when he didn’t play. Fair criticism is good but I see some people who are clearly obsessed with him and praying on his downfall
It was a drive though for Portugal congrats!
Honesty the Ronaldo snub was very unnecessary by the coach, but so much respect and praise for the rest of Portugal they played so brilliantly, not even rooting for them but this was definitely a great moment for them
Ronaldo m’as cus he didn’t score ? They guy is an absolute wimp ; anyways great job Portugal
I respect the Portugal coach's decision.
Why are they always African?
So… we’ve reached the super sub Ronaldo era for the National team too? Interesting bc I’ve heard some things about how you can’t win without him
Was Switzerland even trying?
lets go portugal that just shows how good Portugal is without Ronaldo
Portugals team looking rather nice!!!
3:35 "Two Brazilians challenging for it."  lolwut?
Ronaldo must be careful not to tear down what he's built over the years, with his Untamed ego intertwined with his persistent sour attitude.
Glad Switzerland has been eliminated.
Who was in switzerlands group?
Iran did a better job than Switzerland against England 6:2
It is very good strategy on Portugals team. Till knockout you need a star striker but moving forward you need team players and Ronaldo most of time is always trying to score himself and by the time he passes it’s very late. It’s time for Portugal to play as a team and not depend on one man.
I think he's needed on Morocco for sure if not will get lost
Its the begining of a new era for portugal soccer...The Ramos era...everything good will end one day..this day is the end of the CR7 run....bless him..
Maybe question should be where we're all the players this far...
"Suui"
Bro hit the griddy
Asking that question after getting all the way hear, not respectful...
I would Love nothing more than to see Ronaldo vs Messi.. What a dream that would be!!!
Does his head have sticky stuff lol Portugal had an amazing day... Switzerland very nice of yous' toake them look good... Nice work Thank the fans, owners, especially workers, sponsors teams for performance...
No one player is bigger than a team...everyone is replaceable in life..no condition is permanent
Surprised the thumbnail isn't CR7 on the bench. Mfs kept switching the camera on to him for no reason lmao
Anybody else take that parlay on FanDuel ? 😂💰
Man Utd watching this be like: "we've got the perfect replacement" .
Is it even real 6-1?? Congrats Portugal.
How did Switzerland even get this far playing like this. Stop being neutral and score a goal already.
Praying on another mans downfall is just flat out crazy and sad, you guys need some real help fr.
"THE OLD MAD GET HIS GOAL"  referring to Pepe the commentary :)
Ramos didnt need to steal a goal from his teammate.😉😉
well well well...Ramos is the new CR7!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Keeper was thrash
Extended highlights please !!!!
Making it look easy!!
Why are the videos in 720p ? It’s 2022 let’s assume 1080p minimum.
So long, tapnaldo
Why isn’t Ronaldo starting?
Wow Portugal played amazing🤗🙃 while Spain disappointed me!!!🙄😒
6-1, without Renaldo!!  WOWOWOWOW!!
Wow, Portugal looks amazing...
Could use ronaldo as sub in second half
@0:46 -That’s what she said.
It makes sense after they beat Nigeria 4-0 without CR7. Ramos scored in that match as well.
Sheeesh. Portugal casually destroying their opponent
Why was Ronaldo even benched?
That ref was pure trash
CR7 area is over
This team coach is a master. He sat CR7 to prove a point and he did it like a hero. Congratulation to those players who work hard and contributed. CR7 was substituted just to stop his crying.
Those goals were pretty.
Bro was really doing the griddy 4:35
The coach must be blind to not see the potential in leao with only 10 min he scored 2 goals and he playing 5 min for match lmao i wouldnt even care if they lose in the next matches if they dont put leao
Everyone is  crazy after Portugal steamrolled Switzerland ,Holy cow. What other outcome was there?
All this hate for CR7 why lol 😅
Could you imagine the Chicago Bulls sitting Michael Jordan at age 37 or any age for that matter?
Portugal is better without Ronaldo. Only the fan boys don't want to acknowledge that. Factos.
Man these announcers said Brazilians for Switzerland’s gol.  Come on
Portugal vs Brazil my final prediction
That griddy tho
He can be a super sub, the dynamic of Portugal without Ronaldo was amazing
I don’t know what that defender was doing when Ramos was trying to score the first goal. He was just folding his arms and didn’t even try to block him in any way lol. But hey all hail Ramos! He is a big deal now!
Cristina finally benched. Portugal always plays their best games without that diva on the pitch. Was the same thing when they won the Euro.
The Swiss were my pick to go all the way to the finals, I guess not. Congrats to Portugal for a dominating game. I did win with Morocco knocking out Spain.
They are saving Ronaldo for later game
Ronaldo just bought himself a spot on the bench. I love the man but he’s getting harder and harder to defend.
Ronaldo sticking around too long, suffocating better Portuguese young talent?
Now I’m 100% sure that FIFA sell games
I saw that guy do the greedy
Viva Portugal 🇵🇹
poor swis
This game was weird.
Load management for Ronaldo
Was that goalkeeper paid off?
Ramos been playing good all year in benfica …  Our coach sucks … hope he gets fired …we have so many nasty players but he always has is favorites …  Sanchez is nasty …. Our coach is a dinosaur….
This Portugal side is incredible!!!
POOPNALDO 👎👎🤣🤣🤣
The Irony of Switzerland’s initial letters being “SUiiiiiiiiiiiiii”
What a slaughter! Lol congratulations Portugal!
When is the last time there was a hit trick in the knockout stage? Anyone know?
That's not a score to be had at this stage of the Cup....
Guys I don’t watch soccer why was Ronaldo not playing
Congratulations, Portugal from Korea!
Penaldo
All I see in the comments is Ronaldo haters and people celebrating Ramos hat trick but no one is talking about Felix I mean jesus he’s so selfless. A true team player. will make a pass for others to score and create opportunities without trying to be selfish and do it himself
Brazil and Portugal were just warming up with these teams.
so much hatred for ronaldo....just stop the hate
Y’all expect Ronaldo to carry the team. It’s great that the team isn’t relying on him like they used to it means they are good
CR7 is a winger not a CF.   G.  Ramos is a CF.   That's the difference.     Portugal has a very balanced team capable to win WC
Sorry Ronaldo I guess they didn’t need you
Well that escalated really quick 😂😂😂
Sheesh it was basically goal highlights for Portugal
God Bless all The Countries that are playing and in The World As Well!!!! Jesus Loves you and Is King! He is Beside You all!!
No wonder why Switzerland’s abbreviation is sui
Congrats to Portugal!!  They don’t need CR7 when they’re playing against mid-level teams. They will need him they’re playing against the upper echelons! 💯
ronaldo the bench player
As a united fan I hope this isnt the end of Ronaldo but Portugal looked way better without him. Wish him and Portugal the best either way
Cristiano BENCHnaldo 💺
Portugal have one tough and could reach the FINAL ...... 🤝
Goncalo Ramos > Ronaldo.. Keep this starting roster and it'll be a clean sweep for Portugal this year. 😎
Portugal took all the goals of the night, leaving Spain to penalties, lol
Donno why they let Ronaldo keep taking freekicks.  His freekick conversion rate isn't even in top 100.  He just scored a few spectacular ones out of so many attempts.  And media made huge deal out of it.
Wow Ramos is a force to be reckoned with
La manzana de Ronaldo es más grande que suiza.
😬
Rafael did the griddy on em.. lol
They scored more than Brazil vs South Korea
It's safe to assume Ronaldo will be the backup to Ramos.  I suspect we won't be seeing Ronaldo play the rest of the tournament unless Ramos gets injured; even in that case, I'm not sure Ronaldo will be brought in to play.  Portugal is a much better team with the new setup.
if ronaldo was still at man u, he would be leaving instead of going in
Lol and none for Ronaldo
The reaction of the Switzerland Gola keeper after the first goal is PRICLESS
What a doggone whipping!
Portugal was sick 6-1 😅. I look forward to watching predator teams fighting each other.
i didnt know who this man Ramos was  but had a great game with a hat trick..
Yes
Ramos nutted all over Somer’s face
God Bless you! Jesus is King and Loves You! Repent and Turn Your Life towards him!  Make Jesus Christ as Your Lord and Savior! You will Never, Ever Regret It!! God Bless You, He is Beside You!!!
Switzerland has had solid defense. To score 6 against them is huge for any team in the world. I don't think Portugal fear any one right now, not with a professional assassin named Ramos.
3:36 "brazilians" 💀
Lol he did the griddy for the 6th goal
Impressive
Why Cristiano didn't start the game?
Potugal played  completely different after losing to SK, what an adjustment by the coach. Btw Pepe's goal reminds me of puyol's goal against Germany 🇩🇪 in WC 2010. Good luck Portugal 🇵🇹 👍
You can tell how mad Ronaldo was that he didn’t score at all that game
Cristiano who ? Cristiano what ? Christian bludclat Ronaldo 😂
Wow crazy goals!
Portugal - Argentina   please Fifa gods please
congrats Portugal, you are the next on the Moroccan squad list.!!
Yes even though he don’t play & siting on the bench , he is a soul and leader & represent everything for Portugal
Switzerland did not live up to the billing. I was expecting a very tight match
Who y’all got for the final? I say it would be nice to see Argentina Vs Portugal honestly
This was a subtle way of telling Ronaldo: out with the old in with the new ! After watching Morocco Swiss defense is like their cheese.
Portugal can beat any team. This could be their world cup
I don't like those goal celebrations..he wants to shoot people.. that's disrespectful.. 😂 😂😂😂 i
Once again Portugal beats a team that doesn't have the firepower that Portugal possess, will see how they do against Morocco, should be an interesting match.
6 goals = 100% confidence in the starting lineup for the next match.  Sub Ronaldo in only if the game is tied late.
Gotta love the 2 Brazilians on the field 3:36
What in the world? That was Bananas!
That was a humiliation
Ten Hag already an United legend
Wow 🤩  It was like Germany v Brazil ( 7-1)  Pepe is still a playing ?!🤩
Vamos Ramos
They play better without Ronaldo!
Was a red and green type of day
Penaldo the benchwarmer 🤡
Portugal, France and Brazil are the strongest teams so far.
really honestly some bangers in there and in this WC in total
Dam the Switzerland goalie and players were kinda trash
Ramos popped off🔥🔥
Good job Portugal 👍👍👍
Last game Switzerland vs Portugal,  Switzerland won 1-0. Brazil vs Switzerland only scored 1 goal in this world cup. So they are not that easy.
My Bosnia knows what it feels like to lose to Portugal by 6 goals. They've kicked us out of qualifying back in the 2012 Euros 6-2 away in a playoff match. Only thing in the end you can do is just laugh lol. Just laugh it out Swiss fans. But Portugal, see you in the future for the qualification (I know you'll beat us like 3 to 4 goals lol 😂🤣). Hope Portugal wins the whole thing 👍!
Ramos going to man Utd soon
The only problem in your team is the coach … Imagine if we had Sanchez in the middle …  Our coach sucks don’t let this 6-1 fool you …
Pepe goal wholesome asf
Why’d they have to roast Pepe like that 😂
C.R7 can get mad all he wants but he can't argue with the result. They played better without him.
Look like Switzerland packed it in early...
Miercoles 🙉
Comment section: Great game Portugal and goncalo ramos Also comments haha penaldo  Bunch of haters
Wooouu
Tough moment for Ronaldo! End of times
Pendu is finished lmao this match proves it!!!
Ramos scores, camera shows Ranaldo. Pepe scores, camera shows Ronaldo more than the actual goal scorer himself. SMH
Ronaldo snags MOTM in only 15 mins of play time, sensational
Not even penaldo scored
Felix, Ramos and Leao are so goodddd
Ronaldo is junk and rubbish.
Wow they beat switzerland 😂. Talk to me when they beat an actual good team. And didn’t they lose to an actual shitcan of a team 😂
Stop making a GUN sign w/ your hands! Ronaldo and his big ego not needed on a team where everyone scores 😅
That first goal is in the top 3 of the tourney, so far.   Nearly impossible angle, makes it look easy.
Looks like Portugal plays a lot better without a giant ego dragging the team down.
Greatest substitution from Ronaldo what a game repeat to Switzerland for that one goal ❤
Pepe still got hops. Dude got up there. Nice goals. Hopefully 🇵🇹 can keep it going. GG!
Portugal is that good. They don't rely in just one man. 😎
0:57 ... Katon Goukakyuu no Jutsu 🔥🔥
Man, imagine being Ronaldo at that moment. His expression said, "they didn't need me...". He's still a better player than I'll ever be.
I don't know Rick  it looks fake portugal it's not that good and Switzerland isn't that bad  🤔
Bro sometimes I does thing goal keeping has to be one of the easiest jobs when it comes to football but it’s much more harder than it looks I guess
Bench Ronaldo, score 6 goals
SIUUUUUUUUU
Parabéns
Ain’t no way people trashing Ronaldo when another player does good in one match. Look at all his achievements first.  Ramos could be a new star but don’t trash any player for it. I swear football fans or Messi fans can be so immature.
Ronaldo finished
6-1 is crazy
After such a loss Switzerland should be banned to play at the next world cup, if they qualify...lol
Viva Benfica
Portugal plays better without cp7
portugal have potential to get to finals no doubt🔥
Ramos played great, I’m happy for him and happy for Portugal but not ok with the Ronaldo hate. This was one game and unfortunately Ramos will probably never do this again in his life. Portugal qualified and won their group with Ronaldo and that should not be ignored. Viva Portugal and Ronaldo 🇵🇹🇵🇹
Let’s see if that wasn’t just a good day for that guy.
Brasil vs Portugal in the final.
Is Switzerland a team? Hahahahahahaa 😂😂😂😂. Too embarrassing
CR7 looking a lil salty LMAO
I love Portugal because of Ronaldo, if he scored or not we are happy they won and that what matters the most.
Akanji, my home boy scores for Switzerland. Otherwise, congratulations to Portugal.
Let’s calm down it’s Switzerland cr7 is the best player in world the goat he will always have someone on him it is so different playing free when ur not the center of attention so Ofcourse whoever would play would do well since they were prepared for a different team basecally
All the stars neynar, messi, chrisrltisno ronaldo played less than expectation , do stars are made or are they born ?
I’d keep that Ronaldo guy on the bench. He’s holding them back!
did everyone notice that Pendu is not happy?
We must pay tribute to the excellent coaching instinct of Fernando Santos, who put Ramos on the attack instead of Ronaldo.
Argentina vs Portugal final?
3:36 “Brazilians”???
So many holes in that defense they could only be described as Swiss Cheese.
Arsenal should go for Ramos now.. 🔥🔥⚽️
Brazil and Portugal finals ?
🇺🇸 has a better team than 🇨🇭
Imagine if the final is Argentina vs Portugal
He deserves the “Gonçalo” nickname
Brazil 🇧🇷, Portugal 🇵🇹, France 🇫🇷, then England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Portugal was on fire. Congrats!
Didn’t see that coming!!!!
The only Portuguese not happy with this victory is Cristiano Ronaldo😅
Is Ronaldo not in the lineup because of injury and what is with all the Ronaldo hate??
Of course but he’s a part everybody is needed to win the world cup
Commentary “old man gets his goal”  Pepe’s age is 39 🥲🥲  Keep forgetting that in football that’s considered “old man” 😂
Ya vieron por que mexico jamas VA a ser campeon del mundo
Getting benched is not a problem. But if the guy taking your spot gets a hat trick then you are in big trouble. Sorry Ronaldo this might just be the straw that broke the camel back!
This was without a doubt the most impressive showing Portugal as a team has delivered at this World Cup, and I believe it's precisely due to Ronaldo's absence. Fernando Santos killed several birds with one stone today - winning the game, changing people's perception of the current Portugal team and their perception of themselves, boosting the morale of his players, checking Ronaldo's ego, and perhaps showcasing the birth of a new star as well. If they keep up with the quality they showed today, Portugal may go very far.
Now we see how great they play with out sharing the ball to someone who thinks his the best in the team lol
Switzerland sucks 😂 y’all hyping Portugal up winning without Ronaldo 😂
Swiss team is now Swiss cheese!😁
Unbelievable 😮
Ronaldo has been passed his prime for 2 years now. He is a non factor. LEAO  on the bench is Insanity
Let’s see what Messi does now, usually starts getting marked out of games and disappears around this time
I predict portugal lose the game when they put Cristiano on the field.  Ramos is better.
The old man gets his goal😂😂😂 bro he got violated by the commentators
Portugal has a really good chance to win the cup let's go!
😂😂 what’s up with Switzerland??? How the F did they make it to the round of 16??
Noice
Bravo Lusitania!
Portugal played great but if they get to the semi finals and play France or England, they will lose
If Ronaldo really want this world cup for his country he should let Ramos start next game again he can come in at d last minute wat a game
VIVA LA PORTUGAL?
The Swiss have been punching above their weight but against Portugal they were no match.  One of the most impressive wins of this cup...
I’ve been saying Portugal is a great team without Ronaldo. Ronaldo holds this team back
Clearly reseving Ronaldo for the tougher stages. That's where Ronaldo really shines, when the going gets tough.
Pepe is a true warrior of a defender. To have this athleticism and dominance at age 39 speaks volumes of his class. He is part of a dying breed of defenders with his commitment and putting his body on the line. A true great!
All the commentators predicted a 0-0 scoreless grind fest. This was absolute domination. Please please please repeat the 2016 euros , except this time on a international scale. 😍
Zommer😢😢
SUI - 1 and SIU - 0.
The Goalkeeper was a big joke.
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
More respect for Ronaldo, he delivers when he have to, he cheer his team players and more, SIUUUU
They make CR7 look like a grumpy grandpa. The football is so ungrateful.
Portugal is a MUCH BETTER team without Ronaldo - just like Man Utd. And this hints a potential solution for Chelsea, Liverpool, and all the struggling powerhouses. Buy CR7 now and bench him after a couple games!
If that wasn't a passing of the torch I don't know what is!  Great game by GRamos! Wow.
i think regardless of ronaldo having a lackluster wc performance so far, he might deserve to win the thing still just because of how impressive his career has been
LOL was Ronaldo mad at the last GOAL
Not to discount Portugal  top performance, but Switzerland performance was dreadful
They asked Swiss coach about tactics, Attacking or...Neutral!
🗣The old man gets his goal!,do me a favor and show some respect for Pepe
Big supporter of Portugal. Glad they destroyed the Swiss. Shaqiri and team came it bit overhyped after the Serbia win !
I hope Portugal or Brazil win, one because I like Ronaldo better than the Argentine and 2 my gf is Brazilian lol.
😳
Portugal Tribute Roger Federer Switzerland by a set tennis. 😁 Love both teams that played their best until the end. Wonderful the game.
Embarrassing
Better without ronaldo😂😂😂😂
Man, every time Ronaldo flexes his ego, his team shows him how much better they play without him. That's gotta sting.
they need to put leao much early with only few touches he scored an amazing goal he so underrated he's the future of portugal #forzamilan, i dont know does santos dosnt like him or what like he only play the last 5 min always lol
Penaldo can’t even get the opportunity to score pens 😂
Benzema Ballon Doro,Ronaldinho left, Ronaldo benched,Hat trick some not Ronaldo
Portugal was good today, but they won't go for 5 goals  against Morocco
This is the most complete performance this entire world cup. To destroy a Swiss team that Brazil only struggled to win through a late deflected strike by Casemiro speaks volumes of the talent in this Portuguese team. Now the men have been separated from the boys.
Strong Start for Gonçalo Ramos. Benfica Goal Machine 🦅
Holy shisse
End of Ronaldo ?
Well there goes Ronaldos starting job
this is what Portugal is capable of without that deadweight cr7
Ronaldo is the main problem of Portugal. Always crying….The Portugal coach proved that today….
W
If Ronaldo, it would be 10-1
I got Portugal 🇵🇹 beating Morocco 🇲🇦 2-0  As far as Ronaldo goes he has been and always be the G.O.A.T..... Congrats to Portugal for a dominant performance.
What's that walkout song they play before the match?
You know portugals coach didn’t want Ronaldo to pass mbappe in goals 😂😂
Portugal 6 Switzerland Siuuuuu
Shaqiri where you at? LMAO
People that hate on Ronaldo are just idiot futbol fans. He finally has a good team around him hope they go all the way ! Such a good team
Can anyone see how Ronaldo is selfish and angry at the end because he didn’t score he is such a self centered narcissistic guy my god is this the way he should react to the super win selfish to the max
So no one is gonna roast Switzerland for losing 6 - 1? I really do see the bias when it comes to European countries.
Destroy this hybrid team of Swiss!!! Not one player is native!! It looks like it’s Swiss club playing not a national team!🤣🤣
Portugal's star player is Gonçalo Ramos. 👏👏🥳
Messi carries his team meanwhile ronaldo gets carried.. js no hate just pointing out facts 😂
half the game's screen time was filming Ronaldo sitting on the bench 💀
This is what happens when you take Pendaldo off😂
Proper Switzerland destroyer
3:36 Brazilians
The Giddy has made it to the biggest stage on earth, The WC
Congrats to 🇵🇹 ! Team 🇨🇭 is so embarrassing AF overall!!
i think switerland did not want to win on purpose
Ramos got his chance and flew with it!
imagine if jota was there.
Even if Pepe's 100 years old, he will always have elite hops 🤣🤣
Adios Albanies
Leao looks like the more evolved version of speed.
Pepe!!!! Gives us old men hope!!!!!🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
they wrong for zooming in on Cristiano Ronaldos reaction to Ramos goal 😬
Why does Ronaldo have to shake the players hands when he's always with them and ignore the poor kids who look up to his A for nothing. Makes me upset how he does things that make him look the worse human being. I'd be very playful with them it'll also help with his image. And not being an A
All I know Morocco will beat Portugal
Portugal its not gonna win the WC just because they beat Swiss. Swiss its not a strong team
the swiss abreviation is sui for a reason
Ronaldo has carried Portugal since 2004. Now finally they can pay him back by carrying him to the finals. Where he will lift the world cup!!! Suiiiiiiiii!!!!
Goncalo Ramos > 37 year old ronaldo
CR7 THE BEST ON NOT SET
it's all scripted af lol
Ronaldo will still have a part to play before this is all over.
Im praying for Argentina and Portugal to face each other in the final. Both teams are doing well, and there is a decent chance of that happening.
Western pundits of Ronaldo are absolutely insane.  The disrespect and jealousy is hilarious.
Dang the switz flag 🇨🇭is perfect cause they are gonna need an emt 🚑 after this beaten.  😂
Portugal took easy route. They allow Korea to bear them to avoid brazail. Lol
Why was CR7 benched?
Portugal vs SUIIII
Meanwhile Benfica in the Winter transfer  💰💰💰
Portugal 🇵🇹 and Argentina 🇦🇷 at the final I’m tell y’all
instead of 'Hop Suisse!' it became 'DUMP Suisse!' 😆💩
congratulations Portugal is amazing i hope you win the win the cup i will be praying for you guys my favorite country saludos desde México
Portugal had to decide if it's the Portuguese national team or a side of Ronaldo's sidekicks. They chose the former.
They giving him the rest for the rest of the games and maybe Portugal was trying something new to see if it works
Must hurt Ronaldo that every team seems to do better once he's on the bench
Vamos Portugal 🇵🇹 asta la gran final
When a young player scores Man United fans: OUR FUTURE ST!
Portugal can't win the world cup lol
Switzerlands goal keeper sucks. Way to rest Cr7 cause swiss played bad.
Ronaldo’s time in Portugal is officially over.
They let Ronaldo think he scored so he would feel like he did something lol 🤣🤣
Disrespectful to bench your best player.  Morgan Piers will get another Ronaldo interview soon.
Portugal looked good, but let's face it. They were playing Switzerland 🇨🇭,  not France or England, or Brazil... You can all relax with the comments 🤦🤦 it's just Switzerland!!
🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷 beat Portugal
Switzerland goal keeper definitely is not good
It should always be like this. The World Cup and international football is going to be a young man’s game, that doesn’t mean Ronaldo can’t help win. Cr7 is still productive even past his prime he simply can’t play 90+ min with this team he slows down the offense too much but a cr7 with 25 min not worrying about conserving his energy makes Portugal a much better team.
Thank you dear Portugal, greetings from Serbia, hopefully you win this WC.
Let’s go he hit the griddy
Sometimes, a star player can cause setback for the chemistry of the team because he could block upcoming stars from shining.
Goncalo Ramos's value has gone up $50 million after this game.
Esss portugess ehhh
Why didn’t Ronaldo start ?
Messi Ronaldo final bound
ronaldo out here looking like a cheerleader
PE PE
You don't understand how HAPPY I am right now!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭
Portugal to the finals! Hope Ronaldo starts quarter finals
Against Argentina, France and Brazil they’ll without a doubt need Ronald! 😂
This was Ramos's game. And I'm all here for it 🇵🇹✨🔥
I like Portugal Pepe much much more than I liked Real Madrid Pepe!
Ngl the same celly for all 3 goals put me off a little lol
How much Portugal paid that Swiss goalie?
haha CR7 is the only one who doesn't like Win. I saw his face like that several times this year.
🇵🇹❤️
These guys got some serious firepower.
Hoje foi surra
Ronaldo has put Portugal on the map. He has done so much for his country. The least Portugal National team can do is deliver a World Cup trophy to his door.
Viva portugal
Portugal won the finals with Ronaldo in euro2016 against a strong side France. Did Ronaldo deserve credit getting them there yes of course. Portugal has always been a team of chemistry but Ronaldo takes away from that development it’s just true. Just like Argentina who relies so much on Messi.
Messi fanboys will even hate on ronaldo for the match and say his fragile ego focus the Netherlands no more easy teams for Argentina going forward then will see who's really finished
SUIIIIII VS SUI
Portugal rocking it, right on. Solid win, if they continue to play like this they will win the cup.
Morocco is possibly the only underdog team left. The question now is how much do they have left going against Portugal in the Quarterfinals, and can they at least pull off one more upset in this World Cup?!  Good Luck 🇲🇦, and Much Respect from 🇺🇸!!!
Portugal vs France it’s gon be soon
Congrats to my Portugal. Great game today Ronaldo still is the best portuguese player and will be years to get better than him , Still is one of the best ever in the world also. Now: Ronaldo needs to be less selfish and celebrate with others. His time now is to relax and give space to new players
Morocco will be tough team for Portugal !!!! Do you agree????
Any know if Ronaldo will start next match?
the idea that Ronaldo would do anything but want what is best for his team and country is so silly.  The commentary trying to suggest he might be sulking or resentful of Ramos is so ridiculous and shows they don't know much about a true competitor.
I couldn't imagine a Messi vs. Ronaldo final.  Their fans won't shut up who is better for the next forever.
I may be a Messi fanboy but this is the most selfless thing I've seen a player do. Benching himself because he knew Gomez was ready. I've not anyone put the team above themselves like this before. My 🐐 couldn't do that and let others shine like that but that's what makes him who he is.
We all know brazil is taking this cup home. EDIT - actually they suck.
The old man? Lol
Portugal plays better without Ronaldo
it's not because portugal is very strong, it's because swiss's performance was one of the worst in the tournament. If portugal goes in the quarter-final thinking morocco will be as easy, they will get a rude awakening.
Game was not that interesting !!!! Competition should be there
Obviously without CR7 Portugal can play as they should.
Pepe like Puyol.
As you can CLEARLY SEE, they play wayyy better without that Ballhog Cristiano. They should keep him on the bench and they'll most likely end up in the next round.
Many said this was Ronaldo’s best team ever. They are proving it. Ronaldo carried them for years, now the rest of the squad is supporting him
Good game by Ronaldo
It's like Ronaldo on the bench is a good luck charm. They should try it more often.
Speed had the best time of his life 🤣
Switzerland got nervous infront of Portugal . Poor Switzerland 🇨🇭   😢
This game makes the Brazil - Korea game look tame
That gaol from Rafael Leao is just like hand crafted 😢.  You represented AC Milan well..👏🏾
0:20 Why do they always play Lady Gaga Bad Romance
hey put the camera on cristina i wanna see the celebration after each goal .. from the bench ( :
And with that, we move on to the Quarterfinals of the World Cup.  I believe we should also applaud all the teams who made it to the Knockout Round, especially 🇺🇸, 🇦🇺, 🇸🇳, 🇯🇵, & 🇰🇷, who went above & beyond expectations to prove that they were more than just Underdogs throughout this World Cup. Also gotta give a quick shout out to 🇵🇱 & 🇨🇭 for representing, but 🇪🇸, that was something that many of us didn’t expect, and disappointing to many, since some believe they were trying to coast through the Knockout Stage.  Let’s hope that the Quarterfinals have as much excitement moving towards the Championship.
Understandable. Cork is Portugal's main industry. Switzerland is too busy cleaning space debris, building tech, and making fine foods. Portugal had to excel at something though it is just not at a money making industry.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🇨🇭👍!!!, but 🇵🇹👎👎👎👎
Switzerland needs a better goalkeeper
Portugal 🇵🇹 congratulations,its gonna get intense quarter finals.😮 6-1 I don’t feel that bad anymore,after South Korea 🇰🇷 lost to Brazil 🇧🇷 4-1
Portugal found weak team so they fired goals like crazy !!! Sorry Switzerland
Gonçalo Ramos has quite a future ahead of him.
Cristina Clownaldo can only score from 3 yard offside or with a dive in the box - she belongs on a bench
World Cup Final:   Portugal vs Argentina
Portugal team doesn't need Cristiano... he can go home!
Just put cristiano as the substitute player of Gonçalo Ramos!! 🙏🏻
this video name should be changed to "CR's reaction after his teammates got goal",i know he's in a pickle,but what do they expect to get from his reaction?
If you don’t know. Now you know. FORCA PORTUGAL!!!
What a performance
Ridiculous game!!! Fully dominated
Ronaldo seemed very "happy" at the end.
Well not bad Portugal good job boy's
Ramos had the confident! All he did was touch the ball to score!  Portugal 🇵🇹 Brazil 🇧🇷 or Argentina 🇦🇷 for the win !
Força Portugal!
Result was as expected but not that horriblely bad!!!! Sorry Switzerland 🇨🇭
Swiss cheese defense.
Let’s go 🤩 Portugal winning wc 🙏🔥✅🥰🥰
Portugal-Brazil final.  Score: 21-20.  You pick the winner.
Ronaldo didn't play but the team did well ...
Argentina vs Portugal final 🤞🤞🤞
The ultimate showdown would be Brazil vs Portugal! That would be nice.
switzerland 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Soccer is Teamwork.Even if one player miss the ball no ball to make goal.😀
C ronaldo isn’t known for scoring goals in the World Cup … if he started in this game I don’t think he would have scored this many.  Most of his World Cup goals are just lame penalty kicks
CR7 doesnt even need to play for portugal to win thats how good of a team they are
Speed going nuts
Portugal is better without Ronaldo.
Headlines: Al Nasser changed contract and acquired Ramos instead
Ty ETH for showing the wqorld that CR7 needs to come on after game is won
Guys, imagine an Argentina Vs Portugal final, Ronaldo Vs Messi…  Just imagine……..😱😱😱😱
Look at CR7 not celebrating his teammates goal and getting mad the ball didn't get passed to him! SELFISH...
*39 year old pepe scores in the knockout stages of the world cup* cameraman: look at ronaldo!!! he has a substitute bib!!!!!
Shaqiri and Xhaka......KARMA from Serbia
I would not have expected that.
I'm a bit out of the loop on the world cup games. Why was Ronaldo a sub and not a starter?
Anyone know why Ronaldo didn't play?
Portugal national team is called” Iberian Juel box”. Exactly it is!
Switzerland were horrible with Portugal 🇵🇹 😢
Portugal figured out in 2016 they play better without Ronaldo. Now, they’re playing without Ronaldo again
Was taking a maths exam today. When I finished, I raised my hand and yelled "Ronaldo!" My teacher smiled and took the exam. SHE KNEW I WAS FINISHED.
The media can't WAIT to find something bad to report on Ronaldo... it's gotten sad at this point
Ramos making Ronaldo look bad lol
Swiss goalkeeper didnt even tried in the 6th goal bruh 💀
I’m a cristiano fan but is embarrassing not to start and the person that start scores 3 goal wow looking bad for Ronaldo
Super sub!
I'm happy Ronaldo got a break hes been holding it down for Portugal for far to long. Glad they gave the goat a little break
Such a bad game !!!! It was fully dominated
Portugal turn the other team into the Swiss cheese team  😂
Amazing performance from Portugal 🇵🇹
"the old man gets his goal" did him dirty lol
Portugal has so many great players. It will most likely be France vs Portugal semi final
Now watch PSG tryna buy Gonzalo Ramos lol
Anyone know the name of the song that always plays while they walk out each game?
hard to catch up with 1/2 of dozen short
Almost 40 years old Pepe way better than Maguire 😂
This guy is better than Haaland
Switzerland not one if the best teams and the defense and keeper were just plain bad.
Why don’t you show the full line ups, and show the anthems?  These highlight videos should not be only five minutes.  Premier league highlights are like 12-15 minutes.
Ronaldo was in bench and that was why P won.
Ronaldo is done
wow!! I didn't expect this score to be honets: a Portugal win was predictable (no discredit to Switzerland), but this one was a demonstration of force.
What a big confidence builder making 6 goals without CR7.  That means Morocco should be an easier game for them.  Not easy, but easier.  The real challenge will be France or England. and then facing either Brazil or Argentina.  I they they are perhaps the two toughest teams this WC.  But I pray that Portugal wins.  It would be a great victory for CR7.  Definitely good for football.
Pepe looks like a sphynx cat
I am worried about Brazil.
Congrats Mr Santos💚 Where r the idiots that doubted him before the WC??? Come out and apologize now...
Excellent decision by the coach to not put cristiano Ronaldo on the field since the start of the game. 👏👏 Portugal played much better without cristiano and his narcissism and tantrums. Awesome player Gonçalo Ramos. 👑
😆 🤣 😂 LOL. The Old man gets his goal.
Switzerland goalie literally frozen during most of the match...
Leao needs to start
Fake crowd noises for when Ronaldo came on lol.  Great game from the Portuguese.  Fun to watch!
Portugal 🇵🇹  defeated so badly !!!! Sorry Switzerland 🇨🇭
Great game by Ramos...he needs to work on his celebration now. Blowing your fingers like they are smoking guns stopped being cool about 100 years ago. I guess in Portugal that's badass. lol
Ronaldo watching his replacement scoring a hat trick must've hurt his fragile ego
Naldo looks sad not being the top g
If Ronaldo was there, Switzerland would've won 😂😂😂
If Ronaldo had this kind of team when he was younger, Portugal would've won the World Cup by now. Hopefully he can go get it this time, its the best shot he's had.
Ronald is going to get replaced. Goncalo Ramos is what Portugal need up in the front.
I think it's safe to conclude that it's not a coincidence anymore that Ronaldo has played for both club and country now, and he helps his teams best from the bench.
Swiss lost their spirit at the very beginning.
Diva Ronaldo interview upcoming. "I feel disrespected by the manager for benching me and G Ramos for outshining me" 😂🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Leao needs to start!!!
Congratulations Portugal. The Swiss did not show up. No heart, no passion an embarrassment. Morocco will be a different story. I hope Portugal does not get too confident.  It will be a great game.
Brazil: I've seen this before...
Portugal played beautiful football without PENaldo. Surprise surprise.😂😂
Argentina vs. Brazil France vs. Portugal  Could we see Messi vs. Ronaldo...?  I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. This is gonna be epic
wow ronaldo sit on bench when first goal was scored and then looked unhappy each time his replacement scored how jealous
Interesting that Switzerland -- with no colonial history -- has multiple African players.  Still couldn't beat the Portugese though!
Ronaldo was a hog in previous matches. Now other players have the freedom and creativity. Bench Ronaldo.
Goncalo ramos replaces Ronaldo and in one game has more goals than Ronaldo in the entire tournament 😳 take a bow Goncalo👏
Is portugal a muslim country?
Really sad day for Cristiano Ronaldo 😢
Man it’s true  No penalty  No party.   Ramos really making sure Ronaldo never plays again.
Result as expected!!!!!! Congratulations  Portuguese.
Today's matches have been very weird. The World Cup has been full of surprises.
Good old Pepe is still a world class player.
ISHOWSPEED
What a great peformance by Ronaldo.
I'm happy Switzerland got smashed lol
Leao should have been a starter over Ramos. He even got a goal playing only like 5 minutes , he’s a great young talent but all credit to Ramos. Regardless the whole team is what won it today
Ronaldo the GOAT 🐐 motivated his team and make them score 6 goals
I've never heard of this G. Ramos before this match and then he comes and scores a hat trick on the knock out stage of the world cup. Skill or luck?
Not the commentator saying "the old man scores a goaal"😂😂😂😂😂
This is slaughter.
brazils gonna win!!!!🇧🇷🇧🇷
Ouch if you're Switzerland, and to think Cristiano Ronaldo was benched...  Portugal, good luck against Morocco, and word of caution -- do not take them lightly, lest you get the same treatment as Spain.
Penaldo is holding teams down. They play a better football when he’s on the bench
We might have just witnessed the birth of a new star. Ramos was absolutely unbelievable!
Very glad to see swizerland beaten
Listen, Portugal doesn’t need Ronaldo to win. I’m sick of all these people saying that Portugal sucks and Ronaldo carries the team. Portugal is a wonderful team, they didn’t have Joao cancelo or Ronaldo or Danilo. The Portuguese team is loaded with talent. I mean, Switzerland isn’t a bad team, they beat Serbia! As a matter of fact, portugal played so fantastic and precise that their worst player today in the game against Switzerland was Joao Felix.
Congratulations to Portugal, I think that the team plays better without Ronaldo, Ronaldo only thinks about his stats,  Goncalo Ramos earned a spot in the starting lineup, I know the Ronaldo lovers will crucified me for my comment. Is about the team not Fc. Ronaldo. Go Portugal.
Shout to Ronaldo's “replacement” Ramos on getting a hat trick
Look how they massacred my boy Yann Sommer, feel bad for him.
The 200 Million Dollar Man warming the bench - let's hope it stays that way, then he can disappear into the desert and never be heard of again.
What an absolute snipe
Given Pepe & Ronaldo both being old why was only one benched?
Don’t get me wrong Brazil 4-1 win vs South Korea was impressive but this 6-1 win from Portugal is probably MORE impressive considering the fact that EVERYONE thought this game was a toss up and Portugal came out and DOMINATED but Brazil just came out and did what they had to do and dominated none the less.
Guillermo Ochoa was Switzerland goalie??
That Portugal vs Argentina final is looking a lot more likely now
See now me personally, I wouldn't have taken that.
They were just reading their star player
I’m actually shocked.  Sergio Ramos looks so different. Changed team and above all scores a hat trick
as a korean, i dont feel that bad anymore
Can we please swap the Portugal game on Saturday with one of the Friday matches? I’d rather watch a good game than a slaughter fest on way day off.
Portugal won 6-1 without CR7. Hope he still plays a big role & gets to the Final.
Let’s get it. I predict France vs Portugal and Argentina vs Brazil for the semi finals. Whichever teams make it to the final I’m sure it’s to be a great game.
Switzerland goalkeeper sucks big time 😂😂
Speeed!
Morocco 👌
What an absolute cluterfuck of a game for Switzerland. Almost got 7-1’ed. that woulda been tragic
If Argentina plays without Messi they are nothing, the Argentinian team is nothing. Portugal is wayyy better
Is Leao the first soccer player to griddy after a goal? 😂
Out of all the teams in the knockout stage Portugal impressed me the most considering the fact that EVERYONE thought this game would be a toss up and Portugal came out and dominated
Ronaldo holds them back when he plays
I smiled when they sub on CRISTIANO RONALDO. Super happy moment
Vamooooossssssss!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Pepe is an absolute monster - whether it be killing .. I mean defending or scoring goals
Congratulations 🎉🎊🎈 Portugal 🇵🇹
Idk why leao doesn’t start. He’s better than Felix
Great job by Portugal. Unlike Brazil, they didn't rub each goal they scored into their opponents' faces. Showed how to dominate with class. Can't wait to see Brazil humbled and see how they like it when another team humiliates them.
Swiss goal keeper is on strike?
Portugal can win world cup without Ronaldo
Couldn't be messi... smfh ... cristiano looked stupid tryna celebrate with that yellow thing on. He was clearly bringing the team down, so they benched him and threw that nobody in there to shine in cristianos face. Couldn't be messi...
Made Ramos 96 rated in my Create- A - Club series #fifa22 insane to see him score a hat trick for PORTUGAL
Congratulations to Portugal team and portuguese people's ..from italy . What a team you got ? Fenomenali ..I've little to none doubt on whom the best team in Europe ,IS Portugal ..not france not spain ..and especially not italy.
Forca Portugal 🇵🇹🔥
Portgual... I can't believe estoy preguntando pero pido venganza por Espana.   For the iberian?
This is Morocco right now 👉🏼😬😳😰
*Goncalo Ramos* is the new hero for Portuguese,, he became the center of attention, but *Ronaldo* is still the legend. Great victory✌️ to Portuguese, and much respect to Switzerland
No Ronaldo 👎 , No Problem !  ⚽️ ⚽️ ⚽️
Go Portugal 🇵🇹 👏 💪 💙 🙌 ❤️ 🇵🇹 👏 💪 💙
Portugal totally destroyed the Switz! Ramos was on that sharp shooter complex! 6 without Renaldo! That was impressive!
Ronaldo’s kicking the air rn 😅
yall wanna show ronaldo so bad 💀
A lot ppl hate Cr7 but can’t denied Portugal are looking good this year despite ppl are rooting for Argentina more
Portugal vs France Or vs Argentina? 😳🫣
People just don't know check the youth Portugal even past Ronaldo are going to be a second France were they can have to starting xi their gonna be the favourites for the next two world cups.
Good line up choice by Fernando. Portugal is full young talents and might cruise all the way to win their first WC!
Ramos was like: “this is it chief, this, is, it. We wining the ENTIRE world right here, RIGHT NOW.”🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
no mercy!
Congrats, Portugal! Parabéns! 🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹
SHEEESSHSHHHHH
3:36 did he say Brazilians?
Leao just did the griddy.
Nobody needs Ronaldo right now. His attitude is just wrong and can never be fixed.
Rafael Leão wouldve had a hat trick if he started too! ⚫🔥🔴 #ForzaMilan
Maybe now people will finally respect Portugal and stop underestimating us
Messi Vs Ronaldo at the finals 🙏
Made in Seixal 🔴⚪️🦅
You know Ronaldo isn't needed when two defenders score goals.   Shout out to Pepe and Guerreiro.
Imagine being the guy that replaced Cr7 and dropping a hat trick🔥🔥
Crushed!😂
Ramos is a beast
Without Ronaldo !!! What a come back 🎉🎉🎉🎉 well played guys 🥳🥳🥳
Messi vs Ronaldo final??
ronaldo the GOAT
no need for ronaldo anymore
They are doing great, I  think this team has got it takes to win the World Cup, they are probably even better than when they won the euros, but of course there is other tough teams to beat.
Beautiful goals wow 👏🏼💪🏼👍🏼
Cristiano who?
In any case, Ronaldo deserves respect! His experience will definitely be needed against stronger teams. We have seen many fans who do not believe in Ronaldo and are ashamed of it
Portugal went crazy on kangaroos 🦘😂😂
Morocco 🇲🇦 will not be easy 😂
That was almost as bad as Brazil vs Germany in 2014 💀
Griddy??
Alright who spreads the rumors that RONALDO is unlucky 🌝🌝🌝
I’m a Ronaldo fan but I gotta admit, Ronaldo is garbage he couldn’t even score against South Korea or a washed up Switzerland 🤡🤡 Mbappe is carrying France 🔥 While Penaldo is getting carried by Portugal all Penaldo has is his little Mickey Mouse penalty goal.💩💩 🤡🤮  Mbappe >>> Penaldo 🥱
They keep playing like this they can make it to the finals easily and even win
Congrats Portugal! 🇵🇹🎊🎈🍾🎉
Yea babyyyyyyy
Portugal without CR still Portugal.  Argentina without Messi is nothing
Leao should start
Portuguese coach looking like a genius after starting Goncalo Ramos
Poor Speed
Morraco has their work cut out for them
What a day for Goncalo Ramos. A hattrick on his first ever Portugal start. Especially in the knockout stages. That is absolutely incredible.
Sommer is garbage 😂
Portugal 6 Swetzerland 1 -  Ronaldo 0😃
Who’d have guessed it, if you take Ronaldo out of the team they start looking like a contender. For those of us who understand the game, it was always pretty evident after he trashed Juventus and Man United. He must be loving it though, getting carried to the quarter final having done absolutely nothing but shamelessly dive for a penalty and try to steal his “teammates” goals.
Ronaldo's not touching the grass again at this tournament. Ramos gonna carry him to the trophy this year.
Portugal world cup champion 🇵🇹 🇵🇹
Do y’all see Switzerland’s Acronym….. SUI!!!!
They didn't need him today, but they're gonna need Him for the rest of the road.
This games proves Ronaldo is finished. No Ronaldo = Big party .

Which Ramos is better at the world cup? Sergio Ramos (Spain) vs Goncalo Ramos (Portugal)  Which Ronaldo is better at the world cup? Christiano Ronaldo (Portugal) vs Ronaldo Nazario (Brazil)  Please mention both
