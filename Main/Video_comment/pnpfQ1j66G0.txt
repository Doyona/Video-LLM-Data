Needs 5 more bottle cages
Please get rid of the cheap stamped steel V Brake, just use some decent Shimano T4000 for both.
How high bros handlebars were when he went form 100mm to 200mm boxxer
your next one better be shiftable. 🤘🏼
Keep it up and you will beat Charlie zelennofs recory
The chain tensioner would be more effective on the forward (return) side of the upper chain so when you pedal it’s a straight strain.
Normal YouTube Tall bike build, ride on the road. Berm Peak version, Build Tall Bike, "Then send it!"
I love the looks
Dude. The talll bike simply shows Seth where to duck for upcoming trees. At his height that would not be possible. 🤐😆
I know this is from 2 years ago but what if you added the Head Shok to it?👀
Can you turn two surleys into a big bike please❤
Can't wait to see a vertical cargo bike soon
you don't do any bragging about how effortlessly you mount that tall boy. This old man is impressed!
Walmarts taking notes on this I hope.
thanks man great tutorial
1:10 there is no ripping bikes apart…there already ripped apart 😂
I know this doesn't have the most views out of your videos, but it's honestly one of my favorite videos you've ever made and I rewatch it regularly.
Ok I have a really bad idea that someone should make. A Tall Swing bike.
6:02 - I'm telling my laptop he's got the chain tensioner on the wrong side of the chain! 7:02 - He has sneakily moved it to the front.  Thanks for listening Seth. There's not many YouTube creators who go to the trouble of responding to verbal feedback within one minute, but nearly 2 years after the video was first posted. That's dedication!
Shoulda used entombment of the machine or escape the fate’s guillotine (any number) so epic and this bike fits the sound, crazy technical build On another note, les brown and his band of renown would have been a  great choice as well
bro got 2 bikes, 4 bottlecages, 2 crankshafts and more just to be equal in height to a 6 ft dude in a normal bmx bike
Hi   I need 1 tell bike! Hiw can i get it pls. Bristol england uk!
Might be able to help the center of gravity with a smaller front wheel or larger rear if possible. Might not be great for performance but what kind of performance are you expecting from such a bike ?
It's like the SUV of bikes; completely pointless and ridiculously top-heavy but hey, if it puts a smile on your face...
Easier to flip the frame upside down swap the crank and fork around.
Finally Seth gets to experience the joy of riding a bicycle as a normal size adult man
Nice job👍 First time I saw such bike was in Vancouver in 2010. I found it as a brilliant idea. Still thinking of having one here in Poland.
now the thing im wondering is, Could you weld another bike ontop of it?🤔🤔
Question… I cracked the chainstay if my mountain bike. Aluminum frame. Will welding help save a $3k bike?
Awesome.
I met a guy who did a popular classic spanish race (La Quebrantahuesos) twice with a tall bike like that. Another year he did it riding a folding bike. A legend.
Very entertaining...easy quick fixes, move the seat as far forward as can, maybe the seat post can install backwards, putting you forwards?  And then add a longer stem...what a hot watching you ride it!
would you reccomend the stem for mtb
"When was your last CAT-scan? You should probably make another appointment." Good fabrication skills, possible signs of a Brain Injury or Mental Illness.  I thoroughly enjoyed the video! Keep up the good work!
he should revisit it and add sram Eagle AXS
Making it long tail bike for more stability. Also MTB just to flex on people in mountains.
Would you all one of those awesome bikes if not do to know where I can buy one
and when you make the steer reck from a car/truck
Me and my papa build these a lot would recommend and so fun😊
Question, I have a cube curve Trekking year 2012. With a shimano xt groupset of that year. I was wondering if the frame would hold up for some downhill and maybe slight gaps/jumps. I am on an extreme budget and am very happy with my trekking bike. So i dont want to fork out the money for a new frame. I have a seperate set of sturdier wheels i have somewhat more agressive mtb 28x2 tires. (From schwalbe) for flat trails i have no complaints or concerns, but i was just wondering if the frame would hold up to my 200lbs if i tried some tabletops or my local pump track. I have never actually sent the bike into the air because of this concern.
That's a cool bike. I bet that this bike would be a good bike for the talles man/woman on the planet. I've heared that the talles man on the planet wanted to ride a bike but, the was NO bike big enough for him to ride on.
you should put a lefty on it
4:57 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's it just me, or are the seat and handlebars not to the correct height with respect to each other?
Now is it possible to do a Triple decker bike!
now wled two mtb frames to make a car
like 15 years ago you would see them here in amsterdam
yo hice una ....también  desde cero. y te entiendo  amigo.
and then imagine trying to ride that on the road and at toppled over the just think about that for a moment
i was going to comment that the tensioner was on the wrong side but i see you worked that out before the project was over 😂
Would be cool to see a "Mountain Tandem Bike" as a next weird project :D
3 words penny farthing 2.0
when i was a kid friends of mine would make forks longer on bikes.
At my age and bum body parts, I feel good if I can just get on my regular bike without falling because my knee buckled on me... :(  Getting old sucks...
Anything created in the way of bikes is great.  Cheers from not very unbikefriendly Vienna, Scott
i will love see like this but Ebike make one please....
Now make a triple decker bike😂😂
Why did you use a trek those are expensive
Seth, if you do another one, leave the rear triangle and rear wheel of the top bike and have that wheel spin via a chain from the lower cassette and then the upper wheel can spin and do some other (TBD) job like power a small generator that would in turn power some lights and a spinning disco ball.  Or whatever, just go nuts and have fun doing it!
I too own a welder *Grabs each other's wieners to shake hands*
Bulit a few of these in the 80's when I was a youngin'.  What a blast!
It looks ready for the maim frame.
A grinder and paint make you the welder you ain't.😉
I'm sad that you purposely tore apart that trek which I saw in another older video in perfect shape.
You ruined a perfectly good chromoly Trek frame? What ails you? Anyway? A novelty project like this should use department store bike frames, not good frames, obviously. I stopped watching at 3:30 when I saw the sticker on the destroyed Trek frame that says it was built with Tange chromoly tubing.
I feel like every time Seth does something he says “ I can not stress how much this is not a tutorial “
Why isn't Emett in the thumbnail?
All the luggage options for touring
Put a suspension fork
That's a bikepacking dream machine, you could have 3 frame bags and a pile of under seat bags on it.
That trek frame looked pretty cool. This is the only video in the last year on this channel that caught my interest.
you should try to make a two bike from fork to rear wheel
Now add suspension lol! You could have world record level fork travel that wouldnt possibly make the bike impossible to ride without braking your neck......
how in the hell do you just get on it like that
Using cantilever brakes?
wheelie 🤣😭
how do you get on and off edit: also I would make it longer
8:11 best part
I realized where the piece of metal that he used for the steering tube came from it's the handle for his Jack
Have anyone tried to wheelie that?
I’m so glad I watched this video 3months ago because now I’m in love with your content  Best YouTube recommendation ever
Rad!!!
I thought those Red water bottles with fire extinguishers for a second
can you put either the largest bottle cage you can on it or make a tall road bike
Awesome video, please make more like this, learn so much
the four bottle cages are what do it for me honestly
My man became 6’ 4” 😂
Put a dropper post on it
10:34 So the bottom frame ought to be a cargo bike
No do dirt merch on it
Put you a peg by the back wheel on the left side so you can easily get up there that's what I would have done
No way you jumped that bike seth. You absolute madlad 😂.
Now make a tandem tall full suspension bike with at least 4 more bottle cages
Great tutorial!
The water bottle slosh effect performance?   That is awesome, great work.
used to see these around fairly often in the twin cities, sadly i havent seen one in a few years
Is this good for a person that is 5'6?
I have an idea that you should build a three decker, full suspension, welded together mountain bike, three full suspension bikes on top of each other welded on that would be freaking radical and make sure it has disc breaks with fat tires 29 inch rims really fat tires that’s going to be the most comfortable bike in the world. Think about it. Three mountain bikes that are full suspension mountain bikes on top of each other welded very very comfortable and making it an E bike. Yes you heard me right an E bike with a 200 V battery or even higher I might even build it myself.
My dad told me him and his friends did something similar as kids. They called it a highcycle.
the best part is that this isnt even nearly the sketchiest thing Seth has done, lol
Love your content.
Imagine attempting the maim fame with it😂
I remember when you did a video about them years ago😂
I think if you’d put the up chain ring in the outer location you may have avoided the chain rub allowing you to use a front shifter on the lower.
ok thats it i building one
Imagine Sam Pilgram shredding with this
For some idea, can you do some diy tubular fork for future video
My ex’s brother had one made it himself
is this a british thing
Imagine the cargo rack (or racks?) you could stick on the front of that, might help balance it out too
My G has arms like a alpaca
When this bike gets more used, I bet you there will be like 60 scrapes on the side of each grip.
Nice 👍🏻
This is basically me as a kid trying tot ride my dads bike.    😀
Great bike
Tall bikes 4 life.  Great bike Seth.  I sent the video to Raven.
One million likes you hit the air bag jump and at least try to land it
where's your full face????
Awesome build.
Now make a triple tall bike
Stupid beyond belief, horrible idea, insurance will hate it, my mom thinks it’s a health and safety hazard… I love it
You need one of those 3M adhesive remover wheels!
Sam pilgrim would be proud
How do you not know that the chain tensioner always goes on the slack side of the chain? Basic stuff, buddy!
Can't believe you jumped that.
The ride part looks awesome. Not an everyday bike, definitely, but when you want to have some fun, that’s a perfect one.😅👍🏻
well hes sure as shit not a welder
Top job👍🏻
I thought the guy who from my city who commutes on a tall bike was hard-core until I watch seth doing jumps off road 😲
its silly, all it says is I have something you don't have
I want to try this some day but with 2 identical bikes.
Hey Seth I’m Henry and I live north of San Francisco Where mountain biking was invented. Me and my dad have been watching for 4 years and we ride all the time together. We also go to the Sea Otter Classic every year and I couldn’t help but notice you sometimes go to. If we could meet up or if you could go back to sea otter it would make my year!    From Henry 11 years old.
yo seth,  i have a problem... my rear brake makes a tick noise when i brake. my local bike shop doesn't know what it is, can you help me out? i got hydraulic disc brakes
I remember when this channel used to be called Seth's bike hacks
This guy is an absolute builder
Mad Lad!
this is one of my fav channels  😀😀👍
Seth, You have made many wonderful videos about berm peak. Do you think you could make a video giving us a whole tour of all the trails and full run of them from start to finish?? I would love too see that!!
It's spin the wheel because it's not balanced
welding tip for the staerer tubes. if the frame is made out of steel, put a aluminum tube that fits true them. it wont weld together and that way you don't need to measure as much
You should try to put a vehicle steering wheel on a bike should be awesome!! 😎👍🏻
Chain tensioners should always go on the slack side of the chain.
Dang Seth! Switching from Diamondback frames to Self made tall frames was quite the step
Why though?
It’s a four year year old video now but I just now saw it. I didn’t realize that Seth has been to my local trail system! Rockville park has been where I’ve ridden my whole life and to see him ride there was pretty cool.
Go to the bike park in Jackson park in Hendersonville
I think you should flip 90s bikes on flip bike
Seth, you've made many great videos that have helped me understand bikes, helped my mindset on the trails, made me a better rider, and provided me with plenty entertainment along the way. However, this is my favorite video you made! Love to see you tinker, be genuine, capture high quality shots and still send it! Thank you for sharing.
I am watching this at 2:46 of the midnight!
👍👍
Why don't you put the beagel on the front
What a fantastic job 👏, I’m wondering If  Sampilgrim can do a back flip with it 😮
Seth my man you are not just a normal mountain biker you sir are a beast you’re the only person alive I know that would take that double stack bike down a flight deck and down some backyard trails you are crazy
you need a suit, a monocle, and a pipe to properly ride this bike.
No way Seth I just found a video of you teaching me how to put a proper car audio ground. Back when you used to make videos for “moving on” I can’t recall you ever talking about this in a video.
What paint do you paint the bikes with 😃
Sam Pilgrim is waving.
Now put a drop bar and a 4-pot brake with 203mm rotors at the front lol
What if you made one with full suspension out of two modern mountain bikes? 🤨
Hey Seth. That quill stem you put on that bike, is that a universal part or is it a bike specific?  Which do you recommend and/or where do you get it?  Thanks and keep up the awesome content.
My first mountain bike was a trek 820 I had as a young teenager. Rode that thing everywhere. It hurt me a little bit to see one get cut up and have the decals painted over.  But, fun vid!
“I’m not the best welder”, takes it off some jumps.
lmao I was grinning the whole time watching you ride that thing
Great vid, Sam pilgrim is the master of riding tall bikes!! 👍🏻😎👌🏻
0:01 GET OUT OF MY HEAD
2:20 - 2:22 Best part.
Would have been a good time for axis!
your amazing as ever 🙀🙀
I wish Seth would help me out with my bike build but alas I'm in Texas
In the Netherlands we would say "niks is af zonder een beetje beunen."
love the video mate!  But i have been noticing more and more accounts trying to imitate you and trick people into clicking fake websites saying  "Congratulations you have been selected among our shortlisted winners 🎁💐  Telegram the above username so we can sort this out"  Hope you warn poeple about this.
Can you please make a beginner “trail”bike under 1000 dollars video please ..
🦈📐🚵🏽‍♂
New editing style?
An ad break one minute in after already watching them before the video... Actually unsubbed
“Im probably not going to do anymore of that” This made me laugh!
This bike is crying out for a wireless shifter
Hello Mr. Seth, in Indonesia you could search "sepeda tinggi Yogyakarta" , you would be amazed 😁
how about a bike stand which folds down from the top bike?
"I am not known as the world's greatest wielder" proceeds to do jumps on the bike
It's the perfect follow cam bike!
I miss the trail building videos ☹️😣
Building a "double decker": Good idea, all fine! But why butchering a TREK 820 Antelope?! Such a waste of a good quality bike! Why not taking another "Motiv" bike?
You turned the bike into the flag of Nepal
not a bike guy but i was hoping for this with 2 people riding it. it was cool tho
Hey are gt bikes any good
Drama drop?
My mtb got stolen and I’m 13:(
4 bottle cages? i see 9 🤔
Is this the same dude that was in Lord of The Rings? The "And my Axe!" guy?
all we need now is a huge tall bike meet in downtown asheville!
I already wanted to point out, that the chain tensioner was on backwards 😂😂
Looking for an original way to get injured i see. Thank you , was fun !
Great tutural 🤣
Step through frame on the top will make mounting much easier.
You spoilt the look by adding bottle cages.
Your crazy man! love your channel!
Epic, I’ve always wanted one…maybe I’ll have one made
How about a tandem tall bike?
As soon as you welder the larger diameter bar to the steer tube I facepalmed because I did the same thing. Best way to solve wheelies is a 24 fork and wheel on the front. Pursuit tall bike 😂
FULL SUSPENSION!!!!!
Feels like a sin to chop up that Trek like that, love the tall bike though!
I've watched Seth's bike "hacks" transformer into literal sense. I like it.
I think a growler and a flask cage would have been more appropriate
Squeaky bum time over those jumps 🫣
I really wish these frames are steel. Aluminum and welding are not two things that goes together on the same sentence.
i liked how the chain tensioner magically got switched to the correct side of the chain without mention. haha
Seth your crazy 😜….why? 😂🤣😝
Hey seth, you should get a bakfiets for trail maintentance.  its a european cargo bike that basically has a wheel barrow in the middle.  it could also showcase to modern governing boards that designated cycling routes can improve both local commerece and traffic condotions.  also it would be sick to watch you shred berm park on a cargo bike.
Seth this editing and video quality is so good. Love the jazz.
This whole build was all about space for more bottle cages.
When I repainted an old mtb frame I tried a chemical stripper which was nasty and awful and ended up using a wire wheel to strip the whole thing anyway.
You should make a unibikle It's a unicycle with a bike front end.  Both the back tire and front tire turn so you can make insanely tight corners and circles.  I made one once and it was a blast.
POV: The guy who makes fun of GMBN steals Sam Pilgrims videos
you look like a common mexican to me
Whats a good beginner bike?
scraper bike
Good luck going down hills on the mountain when your center of gravity is that high.
A grinder and paint make me the welder I ain't.
Would love to see some more trail building or riding videos
Maybe fill a water bottle with lead shot, hang it on the front of the frame...
Cant belive you jump it... People who dont know you Dont know how good rider you are that for sure !!!
We need to get Sam pilgrim one of these and see what he does with it
Probably one of my favorite videos to date🤘🏻🤘🏻
I use my tall cargo bike as my grocery getter. It's the most ridiculously utilitarian thing that I own. Tall bikes will save the world! LOL great video👍
All i can think is with zero suspension any pot holes are gonna be a crappy experience! Edit: lol then in the next shot you took it down the course! Fair play ouch!
Double decker swing bike next
I did this with an old 10 speed and some scrap wood. So much fun and a great conversation starter
Needs more water bottle cages! Also would be a perfect bike for the mega water bottle cage.
xD wooohooo that amazing  take it with you go meet your friends who build one just like that n let him try it xD knew he will be shock like wow that is awesome
no way Seth actually did a jump with a tall bike when i'm not able to do jumps on a normal bike
seth quite recently i bought my first mtb for quite cheap (320$) but the fork doesnt work i checked it and there was a bolt at the bottom of an empty tube any advise?
Hicycile
Awesome video. I'm old skool and I know you are too with the headset install.
Hey Seth, can you try an amazon e-bike convertion kit for a bike?
I love my Trek 820 so I can’t decide if this video is awesome or a tragedy
i hate to say this because in my opinion seth's sponsorship with diamondback was the most iconic bike sponsor ever, but im so glad he isnt sponsored anymore, these videos are way more entertaining and  remind me of 2016 seth's bike hacks, please keep this style of content
You are a maniac...
have you seen sam pilgrims video with 3 frames ontop ? XD
Have you ever thought about getting a Co-Op from REI?
What about try it in your trail (snake pit)
To take this out on the trail and do jumps with it is the bravest thing I've seen someone do
I can't wait until the day that seth decides to get ultra sketchy and makes a full blown full squish double decker mountain bike
6:30 dereller
you should build aloop that gos all the way arouind
you really have to check out the german youtube channel "reallife guys" they build a tripple decker bike that can fit 6 persons
Slope line on the tall bike??
The one thing I learned is seth is the mad scientist 🤣🤣
You've got to do this again, but use a slightly bigger bike for the bottom one and a smaller one for the top half. Also notice the way that Raven used a bike with a very curved middle piece as the top bike. Also I'd love to see you put full or at least rear suspension on it!
You should have added video riding around town with all the strange looks!
nice to see him ride a normal mountain bike lol kidding
Nice cool bike..
This guy can bunny hop a tall bike, yet I can’t even bunny hop a bmx. Skills
The tall bike is cool. Maybe try this one day, but how about a long bike? Just a crazy thought. I'm sure the long bike would not be so fun, as much as funny. Picture three or four bikes connected in a line. Haha.
This is awesome! I'd love to see more vids like this making custom creative bikes start to finish!
I hate tall bikes! They evoke a visceral hatred in me, and remind me of steampunks and jousting competitions. Barf… This is true: I have a recurring dream, always different, yet always the same: I’m riding a tall bike - maybe 30’ high, usually in traffic. It’s very stressful, as I know I’ll have to stop soon, which means falling…
I admit i cringed when you jumped it 😂
Good grief that looks sketch!
I ran into Raven randomly on the streets of Portland. Hella cool dude.
I have a crankset off a tandem that would be perfect for such a project, so I could route one chain on the left side.  Now I need to convince the wife to let me do such a dumbass project.
I know you know tallbikes are dangerous by nature, but I'm concerned that you may not realize just how dangerous your copper steerer tube extension is: It looks like you only press-fit it, which is not a secure connection for torsional forces, and copper doesn't have the torsional strength that steel does anyway. You gotta weld or braze steel to steel.
No Pucker Pad?  No cannon?  I'm disappointed. 😂
Loving the janky bikes even more than janky trails!
Just remember that a grinder and some paint will make you into the welder that you ain't!
Youre a braver person then me. That jump was....sketch.
Hey Seth, do you recall what color paint you used on the frame? I have an old truck that I think this color would look good on.
You insane man great bike.
Neat project.  Now send it to Sam Pilgrim so he can do some real tricks on it.
Awesome video! Now I need a welder and some old frames haha.
We built a few out of 10 speeds in the 70s couple of guys did like triple decker bicycles they were kind of cool and I used them in the parades in town.
That fat tire bike was ur first video I ever watched :)
Sam pilgrim has a new downhill bike
Now you can up the game by welding two full suspension bikes together.
I saw a 9 person bike for parades. It was a tall bikes that had 2 wheels and cranks n pedals for everyone. They had to lean it against a building and get on before riding off in parades..then at the end of the parade they had to drive up to another building to get off. Coolest parade entry ever
Why sir? Why?
Plot twist... that's actually just Seth riding a normal bike
Best thing that ever happened to that turd Walmart fat bike
Tall bikes??? Wouldn't it be better to describe them as "Look at Me, Look at Me!!!" bikes??
I think I broke both of my wrists just watching this...lol
Great video😍
Looks like a spiderweb.
Imagine the crazy bike that pivots as a tall bike
I  forward the video right where you landed on the floor. For this, the concept is terrible, is a bad idea. an accident waiting to happened.  Very super impractical every time you come to a stop, where your feet can't even touch the ground.   Sorry for my bad review, but it is again is a terrible video, and waste of  time, and resource.
next flip bike!?
I think the beauty of tall bikes is in their imperfections! Now I'm stoked to build one for a laugh!
Old shovel is watching in horror somewhere
Take it to berm park 😈
Nice build seth
The entire video I was fearfully anticipating you taking that on trail. All I can say is wow. Must have been quiet the feeling jumping that beast.
this is one awesome build,try welding a long seat stay to the top of the seatpost maybe it wont gonna wheelie
put an Ebike conversion kit on it
Oh noo poor trek
You need to send this to Sam Pilgrim.....
Frankenbike
Headset cups..bmx style..?   As if there's any other way to do it...   ive never used a press.   So bouigie
Flip the seatpost to make the saddle a lil forward
Very cool!  I've never seen anyone ever jump a tall bike. I'm glad you swapped the chain tensioner to the non tension side.
A kid pulled up to me joked my bike was a Walmart bike. I said buddy look at ur shocks. He had exact same gila shocks as me. He had a trek I had a Columbia. Columbia's aren't bad after all. I think mine is what Walmart bikes imitate!
Can you build/learn to ride a backwards bike? (Steer left, bike goes right, steer right, bike goes left?)
NO; FU*K, not the 820. I can't see this video.
hey Seth, I resently perchesd a specialised camber and its a 3x9 speed and I want a 1x11 I went to the bike shop today and it would cost me $650 Australian dollars what's the cheapest way to get a 1x11?
Can u try putting more bottle cages on and turn it into a water bike
Ballsy air Seth! Skills on show!
The dog be like(sorry i forgot names fast): here goes my hooman going go break one of his limbs again
At 10:00 in I realized you are crazy. Crazy fun!  :P  I’m your age and too old for that, lol
New caption. Seth makes an adult sized bike
It is like wrong assembled tandem bike
love your videos man been watching you since you had to pop Alex's shoulder back and 5 years ago this is a great video also I think if you used my bike in the next subscriber Parts bin overhaul it would make an amazing video
just buy a sandblaster, you paint so often.
So I have a question to anyone that sees this. I have an old bike going by the brand name “lake bike”, I have searched this up for a very long time and can’t find any results back to it. I’ve tried looking for sn on the derailer hanger and other things that could pin point me into what the bike is. If anyone else has seen a bike that this or owns one could you please let me know?
Double. Decker. Swing. Bike.
1:30 When the Doom music kicks in.
Its sad to know that this clown machine is more expensive than my actual bike..
Are we going to just gloss over Seth putting that cassette on that wheel
I was surprised that you actually had a welding machine.  However, that gasless welding wire is crap.  Get a slightly better welding machine that will run .025 or .035 mig wire (bare wire, 70S2).  And a bottle of mixed gas to go with it.  75% Argon, 25% Co2.  Often just called 75/25.  This set-up is extremely easy to run.
I learned nothing.  But am very entertained.  This will go down as one of the classic Seth videos.
Next build - Penny Farthing fat tire bike....
This looks so funny but dang you nailed the video again Seth!!
Try making it with a large triangle shape in the chain between the top, bottom and back. With a chain tensioner I found its the best design for the drive trains of tall bikes. Adding a front rack directly to the frame with some stuff in it gets rid of the wheelie problem
Awesome
I love it. I'd like to try one. Looks like you mount that like a pro. Most of them you have to climb on to get up there
There's a video I've seen of a tall bike sending it down green's lick here in asheville. Love that sheet
nothing screams mtb'er as much as an unnecessarily huge cassette
I have that exact mongoose fat tire bike converted to an ebike it's a blast to ride
I'm just thinking of all the stitches this man had pulled out recently 😑
My friend and his father built a double decker bike in the mid fifties.  Nothing new here.
The tall bike I built is a lugged frame with a 4 foot seat tube and two top tubes. Much easier to build and I used a MAPP gas torch to braze it together. For the steer tube extender I used a 7/8 sleeve to join the 25.4 steer and was able to use a threadless Headset. I also added 24 bottle bosses in the frame.
make a fully tall bike....   please...   :)
Not to be negative, but as a welder those welds suck.
Could this bike possibly have suspension???
Now try it in wood, i have.  I won't lie, it is a bit flexi 😀
Very awesome, would love to try one. Is it possible to just put the chain on sorta diagonally, and remove the lower chainrings completely, so its basically the same as a normal bike?
Very fun project. I would swap the chains large and small chain rings to not be so reduced on the gearing
god damn how useless it is xD
I kinda wanna build one with 2 wheels at the front could be really useful in floods
Food for algorithm ;-)
In the city, what do you do at a stop light or intersection?
My grandma use to ride something similar.
Probably one of my favorite videos so far of yours Seth, love the creation ones!
seth should hit whistler with this thing. jk
My friend was doing a brake stand at red light. His was very high about 6ft, and it crumbled under him.  Smashed his hip bones etc.. car behind at red light did not run over him. I would suggest only for parades.  I think the builder used or designed it for Atomic zombie web site.
Can you use a clipless pedal on this bike?
That was such a cool experience, both for me and you (im sure). Great idea. Thnx
Seth switched the direction of the chain tensioner from when he put it on to when we got to stare at it because the brake stuff was in the way. He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did
This bike is sick
Where can i get this headset converter?
when can i order mine?
@Sam Pilgrim needs to come a shred that
Classic project with a classic seth trick. 😂
Make an expensive tall bike
Pretty Sethisfying build 😀
Man, you are crazy (but in a positive way) ! :D
10:16 You're a maniac.
Vincent
nice 10XL 26' bike!
Should totally put a wheelie bar on it.
Next challenge: build a bike out of bottle cages.
"Did this dude slam a double decker bike in an Enduro track?"  "Not sure, but it looks like he did"
I have a trek 820 but a lot newer one and its really good
Hey seth, i have a trick for non lock on grips. most of the non lock on grips have a hole on the end smack the end by using your palms. do it continously  while the grips slide
Trek 820 Antelope.. my first mountain bike back in 92, I still have it today albeit in parts. It hurts me to see this one cut up!🥲😂
Best video in quite a while! Don’t get me wrong, I love every single one and watch them all start to end, but this was easily my favorite. Keep these up Seth!
How the bike is more taller, the center weight it's more in the back now, that's why it want to wheelie on the hill.
Now slap on all those little led light on there
“almost done but first we need 4 bottle cages” got me laughing
Double-decker swing bike any one ??
The homie RAVEN GOES HARD 🔥🔥
In the Philippines we make this one we used when flood level was so high
Trekmotiv xxl … I haven’t seen a tall bike before in person…but it looks like loads of fun in the video…awesome 😎
do a kit bike series!!!
Make a downhill tall bike😂😂😂
Lmao ravens an absolute legend! I went big group ride in the city and he was the first dude i met. Mans downed  a pitcher before the ride even started 🤣
This is why i love watching seths videos because he puts unnecessary stuff on bikes like 4 bottle cages
So awesome!!!!!
2 more bottle cages, for a total of 6, would have certainly kept it from looping out on you. Trust the science!
now that's some progressive geometry. Shouldn't have any problems with peddle strike anymore.
A local guy has one with 3 bikes stacked and a grant steering wheel lol.
is there anything seth does not know how to do
3:17 I’ll take “questions I’ve never been asked” for 400 Trebek
I wouldn't call myself a full on fabricator, but dude, you did really well for a first project. Well done.
dont paint until test ride more and reweld/rejig probably
absolutely love it, ill take three of those please.
Your a damn nut job and I love it
that jump is the scariest thing i've ever seen wtf!!
The start of a new sport, tall bike racing!
Looks like you did not remove paint before welding. Big no no.
Thank you for making these great videos! Seeing you jump off a ramp and log on a tall bike was amazing. 😮 I did learn something today and I absolutely find your videos “at least entertaining”. 😉😁
A semi easy fix would be to extend the rear wheel out some and that would help with the center of gravity problem.
I’m glad you turned the chain tensioner around the right way, when I saw it the first time I was like yeah that’s not how that goes lol. Maybe it goes like that on a normal bike but not on something as cool as this thing lol
That landing over the log was the stiffest i have seen. But it was fun to watch hahaha
I loved this video!(:
Dude! this was epic, great video, sick build, awesome bike! Thanks for the laughs as always!
I'm sure this video would of doubled in views if you did this on a high end mtb bike .. like a double decker full suspension Trek slash or something
Ayyyy love to see Raven in a vid of yours!! Dude is awesome! Raced alleycats with him in Miami, NYC, and the Dominican Republic!
Well, pedal strikes will be a thing of the past...
How do you get on and off with out breaking your neck
Using your superpowers for good! Way to go Seth. So much fun.
I flinched when you went off of the little drop off, "probably not going to do any more of that..." had me laughing pretty hard.
What was that first piece of music in the beginning? 0:17 Sounds like that promise reprise from silent hill
Wow! Fantastic video. :)
That’s so bad ass, props 🤘
been watching since the how to ride street video and still wasn’t expecting that jump lmao
Make a 27.5 one with beefy tires, disc brakes, and front suspension.
The new road/ gravel/ XC bike with doubled hydration capacity and elevated seating position raising you higher into the atmosphere where the air is thinner, resulting in less resistance…
Sometimes I wonder how Seth is still alive, or at least still has all his limbs.
Give it to Sam Pilgrim so he can backflip it
Doesnt aluminuium need to be baked in a oven at several thousands of degrees in addition to the welding to make a solid weld? Thats wat I was told when I broke my aluminium bike frames and tried to fix them, I ended up having yo buy a complete new frame.
It doesn’t matter that the seat is so far back it a down hill bike😂😂😂
I am Dutch and that seems so scary to me. 🤣
That jump was way more than I was expecting from this video
Even though i sold my YT Jeffsy 3 months ago and haven't even ridden mtb in months I still love Seth's videos and they keep me inspired to get back into mtb
love the look on Seth's face when he first went airborne!
dam seth, use a guard !!!
Awesome
Now do it "Unreasonably expensive" with expensive frames, parts
No no no you need not say sorry to anyone, you built that, it looks great and it works, don't be sorry, be proud.
Amazing
Add training wheels on each bike
Oh yeah, it wouldn't be legit without bottle cages ^^
You need to send that to Sam Pilgrim.
Look at you welding!!!  Nice work bud!
Too dangerous
Stupid idea unless you want to get injured or hurt but anything for social media buzz
Bravo Bravo
What would happen if you put a smaller wheel on the front to seating position from being right over the rear wheel?
atay, lisoda ana oy!😅haha.. from philippines🔥
atay, lisoda ana oy!😅haha.. from philippines🔥
atay, lisoda ana oy!😅haha.. from philippines🔥
#42 on trending!!! Great job on this stellar vid Seth!
SO MUCH ROOM FOR FRAMEBAGS
Looks cool and a wholelatta fun. Maybe paint the forks red and it be sweet. ;)
seth is it safe to drill my aluminum bike frame for cable routing
Love it
Easily could have fit 2 more bottles and a basket on that bad boy. I say GO EVEN TALLER AND DO A 3RD BIKE
In the late 1980’s my pops made a tall bike with 2 old school mtb frames still got it after he passed love it will always be in my collection of bikes
You could fit at least 4 more bottle cages.
Amazing video and thank you for l breaking it down!! Despite the economic downturn, I'm so happy😊  l have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my investment every weeks.
I built my 1st tall bike in 1976 and built an upside down bike as well. as a welder if I lived in your area I would gladly give you a few lessons. one thing I think I noticed was your stickup is to far, meaning how far out of the nozzle your wire is, it need to be shorter. fun vid.......

Man my bike broke and im tryng to get the money to fix it im a freaking 12 year old thats tryng to fix his bike
inspired by sam pilgrim i see
I have a friend who made one.  I occasionally see him biking around and it cracks me up every time
Needs more progressive geometry...
Give me 29er wheelset😂 I broke my wheelset last week 😅
Why?
You fell because you cut up a US made Trek......Karma....lol
you could add atleast 2 more bottle cages
3:17 (that’s what she said)
But can you also build a bike with a long wheelbase, maybe 2 meters?
when Seth took the bik down the roll in I thought he was gonna hop off the bike sideways and fastplant the Maim Frame keeping hands on the bars
Love what you're doing here! I have had a book for 10+ years called Atomic Zombie's Bicycle Builders Bonanza, I would love to see you build some other bikes like the ones in the book!
Ouch.. the welds do look pretty awefully 😅
Meanwhile i still have one bottle cage
Can you make a real double decker? with 2 riders stack on top of each other. The better tandem...
Needs more bottle cages.  You gonna get thirsty quick riding that heavy beast.
not the trek
A
Seth, there is more then enough room for more bottle holders on that think ;)
"shut up and take my money!!!"
Felt like I was watching a Colin furze video with that montage
I want that steer tube stem conversion thing for my nineties rigid MTB with 21.5" frame. It's ok..but the steering rod is just too far away. Everyone is like nope, we have nothing for your bike.  Considering to just hack an inch from the original stem and weld it back together.
Great work Seth !  These were very popular around here in the late 90s early 2000s.. There were some REALLY tall ones, lol. I still remember my first time riding one. Thanks for the nostalgia !
Seth's "tall bike" is what most of us call a large.
Grinder and paint makes me the welder I aint!!
This is  I N S A N E !! 😱😂🤘🏼🤙🏼
Tubing cutter on steel pipe, cutting wheel on aluminum, cats and dogs living together! Mass hysteria!
Seth is becoming a 2nd Sam Pilgrim
Seth, you are a madman! Doing Berm Peak on that, WOW!
I'm not gonna lie.. its pretty cool and beautiful. nice job
I've never seen so much fear on Seth's face before this moment 11:42
Any Colinfruze fans watching this
The jump over the little log, I was like (something is going to happen here😳) it never. Good strong bike you made there. 💯👌🏽 It’s all good fun 🤩 😎
It's a good bike for Olivier Richters (Dutch Giant)... 😄
The legendary double-decker-pecker-wrecker.
Sam pilgrim bike challenge on berm peak. Please.
Thanks. Now I want to build it myself too.
Hey Seth,i have a video idear. You could try out a lefty fork,wich is really jusy harf a normal fork.
You should check out tall bike jousting. That has to be one of the most insane cycle sports to ever exist.
You should try putting helium in a mtb suspension
Some people have way too much time on their hands and too much disposable income to do clickbait. Thanks Yt and social media for making everyone narcissistic and in need of more attention.  Can YT please go back to DIY videos
GAH if you were going to do a threadless conversion anyway, why didn't you just leave the custom steerer unthreaded and just clamp the stem on, and go full threadless anyway!!!!  This is so cool though, I very much want to build one but I don't think my welding skills are up to the task. I might do some different stuff with the drive train though. I'd probably try to get a pair of Trek super low end MTB's, the minimum bike that has disk brakes, so maybe like a 3400. It'd be fun for sure.
Great build Seth! Thanks
Sam Pilgrim rides fences and you ride this?
Eheheh the "too far backward" sensation is commonly known amongst tall/long-legged riders when going up hill.   The front wheel gets all "lifty"  and its not fun. If the wheelbase was lengthened that would help a lot, but at the cost of your turning circle.
Sam Pilgrim style! Hell yeah!
Great video! Please make a penny farthing next
Ultimate performance test:  Bunny hop that beast!
I’d give it 2 likes if I could
Can we get more Rc videos?
Metallic red front fork... Please!
Fliiiip bikesssssss!!!!
Seth should of put a fox 36 and SRAM axs on it
I dare you to ride this bike with clippless pedals
doing something not kinda the same this time around
Introducing..... Seth's method of fitting in with his tall friends xD
hey and welcome to berm peak i am seth your host and i am going to show you how to break your wrist really easy :D love it man ❤❤
I like bikes
Your videos are always entertaining
Do this with a down hill bike and make a track specific to ride it, if u need a test ride and willing to fly me over il do it 🤣🤣🤟🤟
Oakland California. Bay area
Put the bottle cages on the inner and outer part of the Stier tube and fill two of the bottles with honey as heavier liquid and that reduces the risk of wheelies. The honey would be for a energy boost for mountain biking.
This guy is mor creative than a 6 year olds imagination
This morning I was wondering where the sun was, but then it dawned on me.
A longer stem would help you get more weight over the front wheel. Reach looks a bit cramped. Great build 👍
Now do a tutorial how to bunny hop
And now, for something different, but kind of the same...
The white fork is ugly.  Why not paint it to match the frame?  Wouldn't switching the primary drive chain to the small chain ring and secondary chain to the big chain ring give you more usable gear ratios?
You should have used sram wireless shifter
Since it wants to wheelie, you gotta learn how to hold a wheelie on it.
A grinder and paint make the welder I ain't.
I see you have learnt what every tall rider knows.    All bike companies do is adjust the reach for taller riders, but never pay any attention to chains stay length.   So that means on very steep climbs you loop out sooner than a shorter rider due to the increased effective top tube length and the decreased ratio to chainstay length vs a smaller bike.    (I guess it's the tradeoff between looping out and cornering like a snail).
Old school Seth! Nice.
Unsubscribe!! You got to big to answer any of my questions.
You know there’s stock bikes made like this right?
Amazing build Seth......... In my view, that's perfect for the first attempt.......Im sure you will be doing another double decker in future !!!!!! Ride Safe!!!
Nope needs 2 more bottle cages
Some guy in my neighborhood rides by with a bike that looks like a double decker
The Tallgoose is legendary.
thats HOT !!
We use to make some 10 ft high.  We would weld steps and use car steering wheels .  Had to run and then climb to get up on them.😅
You done a great job considering. 👍🏻🤟🏻
Heck yeah, I remember the video you made a while back about tall bikes.
0:01  amon-
Jumping that was actually pretty impressive.
YES!!!   THE TALL BIKE RETURNS!
Those jump look so cool on that bike 👍🏼
Do I forsee a double-decker swing bike in the future?
Everybody forgets to paint the fork. 🤷‍♂️
I've seen a guy with one a couple of months ago. The front wheel went up and he fell (he had no helmet on) and smashed his head off the road. Somehow he did not crack his head open. Definetly had one hell of a concusion.
Here for the “pro” welders comments 😂, sick video Seth showing love from Long Island New York ❤️❤️.  Please paint those forks!!!!!!!!
Gotta put some more bottle cages in that 3rd triangle
I cannot express how much my body tensed up at 9:58... oh, opposite side
Can we please get a print of Seth mid-air on this monstrosity? A screen grab from YT 4k just won’t do … my wallet is open.
Finally we get to see Seth on a normal size bike! Normally he is on custom tiny bikes for his tiny body.
There’s been double decker bike at my local skate/bike shop and this finally let me see one in action and now I need one
Thanks for the totorial on how to build a tall bike
now I want to see you wheelie on it
I hate rim brake
"needs 4 bottle cages" :))
A friend of mine has built a few tall bikes over the years, and now makes the wheelbase longer to make them more stable.
plenty of room for more bottle cages!
Gonna need the Web Zapper for sure when you drive down trails on that tihng
Jank factor is pretty high here, I absolutely love it
I made a bunch of tall bikes. Best mod is to extend the rear triangle, like a cargo bike. Adds way more stability, and frees up huge mid section for massive cargo loads. I used to haul loads of wood for framing jobs on mine!   Other tips: Weld on some pegs down low for steps.
Man I'm going to add this project to my list. Also, very surprised you didn't go with a wireless derailleur. LOL Keep up the great content.
seth with a really big brain..nice one man!!
One of the best videos I have ever watched. Great Job!
Hi Seth,  i was just thinking, i hope the end of your relationship with diamondback does not mean the end of your collaborations with Eric Porter.  You two make great videos together.
What did I just watch on my explore page💀 this is crazy
No dropper post?
That huck was sketchy 👍
Frick  definetly
Repent to Jesus Christ ““I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”” ‭‭John‬ ‭16:33‬ ‭NIV‬‬ h
I love your 100% deadly serious expressions when jumping it!
Dude- 10x10 you are WILD for this one. Hahaha so awesome!
a grinder and paint make Seth the welder he aint! looks fun to ride!
Didn’t Sam Pilgrim do this about 45,000yrs ago?
Triple decker bikes when?
Love the videos!! Ever need any fabricating done in the future, check out Penley mobile Welding and Fabrication he’s biased out of Hendersonville NC
It’s just a normal height of bike for the average person, Seth is just short.
its a normal sized bike, it just looks big on seth
i mean you really hacked that together but i’m more impressed than anything! maybe a proper frame builder might have something different to say but i was pleasantly surprised by the end result!
The fact that the whole frame is painted the same color and that the two initial frames have similar silhouettes, gives the bike a proper finished look.
Okay hear me out bmx tires on a mtn bike? Or even one bmx and one mtn tire? Idk might be too crazy of a idea
a 24 or 20 front wheel would help
Your content is seriously top tier
Love these vids where you build, creates, try new things! It’s awesome. Ok here is an idea, move the back wheel further aft so it doesn’t wheelie as much in climb. 😅 Thanks for the entertainment!
if you ever get rid of this can i have it and ride it around the park unironically?
extend the swing arm
Welding whit no gloves😳
Aww, you cut out the part when you realized the tensioner was on the wrong side!
There's a thing called "the reverse bike", I.e., built to confuse the rider,  1. Staring the opposite to turn 2. Pedals opposite to move
Next video: Seth makes a double-decker knee scooter (after braking his ankle).
Would leaving the crank arms and pedals on the bottom gear have caused any interference issues?  It doesn't seem like it.  I think that would have been even funkier with the pedals moving remotely, plus it would have given yoou at least a little more of boost up to the seat and the ability to do some crazy dangerous tricks when you first mount the bike.
Seth, would you say that the tall bike is easier to ride than the swing bike? And which one is more fun?
i always watch seth’s videos all of the way through, because they are all different but kinda the same
I absolutely loved watching this one !!
7:15 8 yr old me riding a mountain bike for the first time.
Better assembly than the Wal*mart bike
Mein Gott!
Was going to mention the chain tensioner being on the wrong side, looks like you solved that yourself.
i'd say add another set of sprockets on the left side of the lower bb and swap the upper to the other side ... then both chains are isolated from each other and you have more gearing options
Aircraft stripper will take all that off
We made them as kids the best one we did was 3 high with 3 back wheels on top of each other was so fun
So I'm guessing these are both steel bikes
So, how do u expect to get the bottom bottles
This is quality entertainment... You rock!
My welding project back in tech school welding class was a dd. Some friends of mine rode it in our city parade. It was awesome seeing my creation being ridin in a parade for our city oktoberfest parade!
Might as well join the circus.
The trek is ok
Now take it into a bike shop with some ridiculous parts to be installed! Haha
Boring content.
Props to you Seth. I can’t even make jumps on a regular mtb haha
This video is amazing. Me and my friend love your channel and we are going to do this now!
You forgot dropper seat post. Hahahha
Please please make a high end one of these like disc brakes and front shocks haha please
For a good  time, hang out at Seth’s.   Great video,  I always check your site first.
That looks so scary to jump lol
Bike manufacturers use automotive body filler to smooth the welds.  Would have worked a lot better than JB Weld because it sands and spreads easier.
I vote a penny farthing for the next build.
Gear ratios close to or below 1:1 are prone to wheelie because your pedal force torque can exceed your weight. Sheldon brown has a page on the phenomenon.
Trying it in the city would have been way funnier (and if you're to afraid to ride it in cities I'm pretty sure you will easily find someone willing to get new sensations on that bike like bike life people 😁)
maybe a headtube fork
you could put a mtb fork on it lol
Seth. A+ for effort. But your welding gave me the dry heaves. Maybe a good series of videos would be learning to TIG weld and make a frame jig. There's any number of classes at your local community college.
I don't know, I think that thing needs a couple more bottle cages somewhere!
Dude you're insane! I was looking at that like "yeah that's a broken arm/collar bone/messed up knee waiting to happen then you're hooning it off jumps in the next scene lol.
Glad you didn't take your head off on a branch on the trail.
No need to apologize to fabricators or anything I've always disliked when people say things like that. You don't need to play down your accomplishments just because somebody may have been able to do it better. There's always going to be people out there able to do something better than you are but that doesn't mean that you doing it is a waste.
Not practical at all.
You are the man!!!
having the weight so far back means you can brake hard without dying
That's was definitely entertaining but I don't know if I learned anything
seth i remember when that dolomite video came out. you've grown so much
Great vid Seth. Forever entertaining and down to earth approach. Seat forward and longer neck stem to reduce wheelie issue?
BuT wHat’S tHe HeAd aNGle??!? 😂
you could say seth is really enjoying time building bikes, hope we could see more of the walmart bikes being upgraded and battling the trails on berm peak 🤘🤘🤘
AGAIN I can't stress enough how good creator you are !
Can't beat a 1x3x9 driver terrain
I think Seth needs to do the cliché, "learning to ride clipped in" video with this bike.
You need to hold your wire welding gun a lot closer to the metal and not have all that wire hanging out…your welds will be 100x better! Good job though!
Tallbike into pool is my tallbike
wew....Bern....youre a great Inventor....Godblss
Well done for a solo first attempt.  I'm have no engineering knowledge.  But I do have some thought on how to resolve the front to rear geometry balance. I'm guessing if you were to change to a smaller wheel in the front , that might improve the geometry and bring the rider's weight forward. If you decide to do another Tall Bike conversion.  Having a long chain stays would solve the uphill issues.  Converting a cargo bike might be a possible answer.
This thing is so rad! Great work!
Such quality videos man
Why are the handle bars so low?
Probably the coolest thing you've build.
I wonder if you could bodge the center of gravity issue by switching to a smaller fork and wheel
What was the low-viscosity black stuff you put on the welds while grinding?
I love the metal, build music
Is full suspension next
If you had fun and learned something you are a fabricator that's all any fabricator does they make something out of nothing exactly what you did
I’m both surprised and not surprised he took that on the trail
Cool vid
I gotta say that I was expecting the welds to look a lot worse than they do. Not bad at all.  Great build buddy. Another great video. 🤘🏼🤘🏼
Can I get a bottle holder for my friends bike he need one pls
Can you link that stem converter?
You made trending!
your boi seth is taking the jumps with the double decker bike?!! damnnnn he really send it!!
Next step, doing it with a full suspension frame. Then take it to Whistler.
Awesome.
All that space in the frame... Bike packing time?
Getting ready for the big flood?
Great video...loved it.  I think your slowly turning into Sam Pilgrim...🤟  Would love to try the bike myself.
Search Zenga Bros.
More montage metal!! Weeeeew! (seriously though, all the metal you got, background-track-it-up)
u should build one out of two fullies, twice the suspension, twice the fun!
A fat motor on that would be nice
Awesome! Need version 2 with full suspension
You should ride the New River Trail with this
Dissatisfied, there was clearly room for at least 6 bottles
You could try running a 24” front wheel to reduce wheelie issues.
You could have gotten at least 4 more water bottles on that thing!!! But I guess it's still pretty cool.
turn it into a hardtail why not
Seth is a maniac 10:17
my man can fabricate too! damn son
Cut the  downtube on the top bike and put the kid seat on the bottom so its for 2 people
Colin Furze has entered the chat
Bro you are going to get hurt again trying this stuff 😂
Ferb, I know what we're going to do today!
You really need to get some front suspension on this bike.
Measure everybody's heart rate for this video guarantee above n beyond like you went off that ramp what the 🐑
You should have sand blasted the paint off of the bike parts before you started welding
Sean can weld too! Truly a man of many talents.
Should I take my triple tall to Berm Park?
1x3x11 speed bike! Hahaha! Perfect, just needs a dropper!
What a great video and awesome callback. Now make a mini drome race video again!!!
imagine putting *ss saver mud guard on the saddle hahahaa!!
That's awesome 👌
Rust-oleum makes a spray can holder thing that you put on top of the can. It makes using spray paint easier on your hand. It cost a few dollars and is well worth it. I don't remember the name of it. Because I bought mine years ago.
Hey Seth are you running just flux-core on your welder? I know you don’t weld an awful lot but may I highly recommend going to gas and doing away with the FC. Much easier and cleaner.
Wow just yesterday i watched your previous video about stacked bike, What a coincidence
nooooo those vintage bikes :((((
Hey Seth, any chance I can borrow this bike for crankworks next week?
Always got to have lots of stare when you're done with a project.
Portland?
One of my favorite videos you have put out recently! Bike looks sick! And hilarious. Hope to see it again or see you create another on the channel.   Thank you for your amazing content!
I think that he should take it on the airbag
When we were kids in late 80s, early 90s, we would pour lighter fluid over the frame, set it on fire. Let it burn for a we bit, then clean it off. Back to chrome!
Why Seth why😩
No idea what I was watching. Was this a little different or kind of the same!?
Why have I never thought of using an impact wrench on a stuck as bottom bracket?  You are fast becoming my "rigged up" idol.
looks like it will be rough on the Gooch if you wreck.
We need more Flip Bike content pls👌🏻👌🏻
Next video, go Sam Pilgrim style and throw some Fox 40s on it.
A friend of mine did a sportif on a tall bike that included cheddar gorge in somerset and wheelying was an issue there as well, he had a camel back slung from his handle bars to try and shift the weight forward abit! He'd experimented with tri bars before hand but commonsense prevailed!
Currently building a tall bike myself, perfect timing!!
I want to see a downhill version of this bike more than I want my next meal.
Yea the center of mass gets shifted so high it’s gotta be tricky riding
Fun video, I'm almost as high riding my 48 inch custom built penny farthing - see my penny farthing playlist on my channel 😉
You do amazing work but your welds are sketch, stay safe.
Try wheelie it
Would have liked to see a close up of the welds after the test ride?  ONE MORE BIKE to add to your odd bike collection!!!!!! I’m planning on building a swing bike & a reverse steering bike.  I have four Huffy “good vibrations“ 26” bikes.  Two are rideable, two are parts bikes.  I picked those because they are everywhere! I might pick up a few more and try my hand on a tall bike to pair up with my giraffe unicycle??🤔🤔
This was fun to watch, but I have to say Seth... I am just left dejected, sad, dissapointed, broken hearted, and just overall underwhelmed after seeing this. you could SO EASILY have mounted 5 more bottle cages on this. I feel that the only responsible thing to do, is to mount 3 cages to every frame triangle. bottom, slant, and top. and you have three triangles. I feel that not having 9 bottles for your hydration is just irresponsible.
Sam Pilgrim would do a backflip on this and it would be tthe dream!
Excellent, another fantastic vid. Though I’d be scared of doing what you did on it, respect for that.
So you know now how a tall person riding a normal bikes feels
Always good to see the upan bike bars I have them on my road bike
Crazy Seth! Lol Hey what is that little clamp thing holding the bike up at 7:08? Looks handy.
Off to Berm Park then?
“I would like to get into some sketchy stuff with this bike”😂
Can you do more RC videos
Love and hate that Seth just put a dream cassette and shifter on what can only be described as professional level weirdness
I can't really say why, but I would like that bike to have a fire extinguisher strapped to the frame instead of one of the bottles.
Yea....we need more freakbike content.
Song? 1:32
The return of Seth's Bike Hacks
oh my catch my breath on that jump lol so fun to watch and yeah i think there is a 2.0 on the make ! 😄
I was extremely nervous for Seth thinking he was gonna take it on any one of the feature... Very impressed he hit that jump with it!
And in next week's episode of Super Sketch with Seth... Actually a great project and video as usual!
This video had the feel of an old SBH video! 🥲
When I built my rat bike I originally found it as just a frame in a bike shop attic. It is a Trek 820 just like this one in the video but it is black and the other frame up there was THE EXACT MOTIV IN THIS VIDEO! Like holy piss.
I really miss Seth in Miami. Not a mtb rider. More bmx and cruising. The Miami vibe was so goooood. A bit more relatable to me.
That’s too little water bottle someone could get thirsty
Two more bottle cages and you can carry a six-pack!
The welding was… Well it wasn’t not bad. It didn’t fall apart. As they say in Yorkshire “That’ll Do” Ps. Time to do some sketchy 5h1t  do-dar do-dar…. Gonna do some jumps with it Zippy do-dar day….
Get this bike to Sam Pilgrim...he will shred it to the gnar.
Seth's pov on that bike is the pov of a tall person on a normal bike😂
Love it
Seth:”I cannot stress enough how this ain’t a tutorial” also Seth: “next step is…” 🤣🤣
Congratz bro, now we're finally at the same height ^^!
What a silly thing you've done.
Seth just because you CAN ride anything now, doesn’t mean you should!! What’s next?!
As someone who's never been able to afford a Trek and always wanted one, this hurts my soul.
You need to build another with 2 diamondback frames and a fox 34!
I weld and build motorcycles and I didn’t cringe once during this video grate job man
When you put a box cassette and derailleur on the bike I couldn't help but cackle.
Needs a dropper seat post, 😆
So you sort of built a Penny Farthing?
someone needs to build a tall bike with two sets of handle bars on top of eachother and a massive dropper
seth is finally a true florida man!
i would love to see sam pilgrim ride this bike
Nice. Can you ride a manual on it? :)
Did better than the Walmart bike 😂
How the hell would yall get off the bike?😀
isnt the chain thing form the Murder Macine
Great for flooded streets
and just if you thought you have seen it all.. seth steps it up, by throwing a double decker bike down the hill.... just amazing....i want to see i next video... how to wheely that moster....keep up the nice work... greeetings
It needs a bell, whip antenna, and a sixties banana seat
Great Project Seth! I think the Tallbike 2.0 shoud be hardtail on top and a full suspension bike at the bottom. Whoud be fun to watch and to ride.
Needs a dropper for the downhills 😂
Absolute mad lad doing those jumps at the end!
Take a bike and mount as many water bottle holders as you can and have like a water bottle gauntlet to where the last one that stays on wins🤣
Could you do this with two full squish bikes? twice the squish?
water bottle... yes
If you want to get around the chain-rub issue, you can run your vertical drivetrain on the non-drive side. That's what I did on my tallbike, and it works great.
Send it!!!!!
I wonder if you could backflip into a foam pit or something
Add a wheelie bar on the back! Lol
I was like ok he did it but then when he took it on the track I was like you are a mad man, respect
Glad you moved the chain tensioner to the front but infuriated you didn't PAINT THE FORK RED!!!
I noticed that chain tensioner jumping from the one side to the other....😜😜
Seth: "safety is important" Also Seth: this
You're getting older it could be hormonal changes that are causing the cold sweats while you sleep.....
Nice!!
Feel a little bit sad for the trek, could be a great retro rebuild
So a comment/question on the previous tall bike. When the angle from the top tube to the seat stays is approximately 180°, and the angle from the top tube to the head tube is approximately 90°, why not just flip the frame?
Seth's turning into Sam Pilgrim now. I'm here for it.
Hey Seth! 2:53 you can see that you mark the front of the threads instead of the back to make the cut. then by the next scene you weld it at the end, making it longer then you wanted by the length of the piece you welded on. Hope this helps on the next double decker bike for when guest want to ride with! Lol
This is where I can see wireless shifters and brakes come in handy but I think it's funnier to see long cables and housings run miles across the bike😂
We used to call it the upside down bike
Next time, use a Real suspension fork from Amazon or something. Could be funny xD
you should switch the front wheel for a 20" - that tilts the mechanical advantage away from the back.
oscar be like when did this guy get so tall
Hear me out… triple tall bike
Love it!
That's was cool dude!, although  the sound of the video was muted ....was anyone elses?
Next one should be full suspension!
מדהים!!! אתה מספר 1
You tried to do the duplication glitch but they partially patched it so now you just have a glitched bike
Now add an ebike kit
seth can do more on a tall bike than i could do on a normal bike
Ironically, this is the most "Bike Hack-ey" content Seth has ever put out.
the fact you took it though those ramps and jumps terrified me! Love your content! ❤️
WOW i thouhgt it would be very difficult to get on, but you get on so easily, that when i saw that I HAVE TO MAKE ONE
as a fabricator/welder by trade, and a mountain biker. this was amazing to watch lol, im inspired to make my own tall bike now!! great job
Those definitely aren’t Paul Brodie welds but it’s a functional bike!
Try and climb on it.
Next week on Berm Peak: Sending the Teeter Cannon on the Tallest Bike Yet
You should like pimp it out with all sorts of outrages accessories and new parts,paint,ect. LOL
Do snake pit hard line
To offset the wheelie put a small tire in the front.
been watching for yearssssss and i don't think ive ever seen Seth weld? Either ways love the channel and videos man!!!
Bro you really don’t need to warn about you getting sketchy with it. It’s a given! Lol
prime booger welds
great job! I want to make one now too :)
you could fit more bottle cages
Hey Seth, I just found out that there are 246mm brake rotors available to purchase for Mountainbikes. It would be lovely to see a video of you brutally testing these rotors - maybe you could find an answer to the age old question of whether bigger is better?  I am a longtime fan of the channel and still get vast enjoyment from watching you tinker around with bicycles.
It needs more cow bells
This is awesome the only flaw those ugly front forks paint them black 😊
Put a fox float up front and a dropper post on it.
Hahaha, very nice :D
Think about how big of a dropper you could put on that
Shoulda gone full suspension
The complete opposite of "Long, Low and Slack"
Gotta make a fixed gear tall bike now Seth... talk about hard to ride...
Now that you have a tall bike is a ski bike next for the winter? Just an idea!
Needs a 175mm dropper
It would be possible to move the Upper Crankset to the Left side and add another Crankset in the Left Bottom side so you could use all gears in the bike and also if you have booth cranksets in the left side the same gear ratio you wouldn't have a reduction? If doesn't make sense it would be a good argument to try!!
send up the Sam Pilgrim Signal ⏱🤘☁
building this was cool in itself, but the fact that you sent it on the trail is so sick! im a little disappointed there werent more bottle cages, but we cant have it all. i would love to see you make a custom frame from scratch! im learning to MIG just to do this myself.
Now you have a bike that you can use to check the trail clearances for taller people. 😄 Gonna spot those low hanging branches easily now!
I rode one of these in the 1980s at a county fair
That was full sketch!!!!
You sir have excellent bike skills 🚴🚴🚴🚴
Needs full sus
Seen these 30 years ago and I am sure they are older still.
You should name this "The Manual Machine"
Seth, can you do a video on good bikes for a 6 year old? I'm looking for something for my boy with limited use of his right hand and arm. Disc brakes are ideal because of the lack of force needed to actuate, my problem being of course all I can find are bikes in the $700-$1200 range which he will quickly grow out of. Any suggestions would be great. Thanks and love the videos.
I like how Seth puts a better drive train on a joke bike than I have on my regular bike!
🤣
Seeing you ride that for the first time made me feel like a little child when I rode a BMX that I couldn't touch the ground on.  I remember being able to pedal, but had no strategy for getting off the bike except for crashing!
4 bottle cages Pinkbike approved 👍
so this is a Seth is bored project change to disks add wight to it
Looks like the chain tensioner would work better on the other side..
You HAVE to try an wheelie that bike.
have to find a bike with less of a seat post lean to keep you more centered.
Please don’t take this too personally (love the Chanel, huge fan) but those welds are horrendous.
Can't believe your jumping this guy!  That alone goes to show how great of a rider you are!
Excellent work as always. But if the gearing gets to low, you could use top 3 to bottom 1 and from bottom3 to the back. Ort top 1 to bottom 1 and bottom3 to back to get a one to one gearing
Once rode a triple bike. Almost broke my hip lmao
Put two more bottle cages on the bars. 🤣
Me from the 10 minute mark:  No, Seth! No!
I swear this is the type of shenanigans I watch your channel for🤣🤣
The only thing I don't love is the boring grey paint. It's a freak bike- paint it a weird color! Bass boat metal flake! Rainbows! Polka dots! Well done project.
full suspension double deck bike with fat tires? and try go mountain biking with it :>
Dammit Seth... now I want a tall bike!!
Damn, I was looking forward to some maim frame action
Put more bottle cages on it!!
"when i pedal uphill it wheelies"  proceeds to take it downhill. I suppose that was plenty of weld testing lol
Should totally be called the Berm Freak.
The fact that you just jumped this is fucking astonishing
Now you know the issues we tall riders face. XL frame, same chainstay length as a small or medium frame. It’s also the radial distance from the rear axle (develops more torque). Still, cool bike!
Its incredible how even this bike have a better drivetrain than my MTB 😂😂😅😅😅😭
You are crazy. This was great tv.
penny farthing mtb when?
Great to see a video about tall bikes again!
Shouldn’t the tensioner on the outside front of the top chain?
Great video Seth, this one was a hoot!
I had one in grade school til it was stolen at the YMCA... A girls 20" cruiser on a second fork and a second triangle... and yes they can wheelie forever... My peers (the other kids) and I could ride a wheelie on a regular bike for half a block or so, but the tall bike I could ride a quarter mile if traffic was in my favor. It just wanted you to be in the right balance point. Of all the bikes I have owned, I miss that one the most, though I would be far too large to ride it now (same reason the collage kids across the street gave me the frame in the first place). I doubt I would build another like it, but it was a blast that should not be as rare as they are.
10:00 lol, then We wonder why
Well, now you have to tell us what became of the rest of your weird bikes. We haven't seen them in ahwile, and just before you moved, you started a bike shop tagging system.
The long awaited return of the tall bikes!
nothing against video, but bike itself looks kinda lame, whats the point of it? from what i see its just worse version of existing product.
Now I understand this question from my insurance company:  “So you smoke, drink, skydive, scuba dive, or ride a bike built by Seth?”
Where's the dropper post?
This is same size as an 21" XL hardtail?
Could use chainring spacing bolts like @pathlesspedaled just used to make his mountain double to re-space the chainring on the triple
Now I want to try and build a slammed bike
Hard to believe that you don't have a media blaster tucked away in your shop 🤷
Bet you can't wheelie that thing
You have raised your channel to new heights!…. Literally….  That looked like fun.  Now Rev-2… hope it’s on your someday list. Thanks for sharing the fun.
Old school X-Large frame on bottom, smaller frame on top helps with the seat not being behind the rear axle.  They are fun.
Now you NEED to show the guys out at squatch
you should make one with suspension
you could stick a fork mounted rack on the front or an uber long stem to try and even out the weight distribution
Give it a wheelie bar!!!!! it would be so funny
I just welded up two bikes into a wobble or swing bike. It was a good time
I was wondering how long it was gonna take you to realize the tensioner was on the wrong side of the chain at first.  Cool build regardless.
You should make a Walmart tall bike
I've been watching your channel for a few years now. Obese at 370, but man I wish I could do some downhill mountain biking. Looks like so much fun. I'll continue to live through your channel for now
Great video! Hey what rock song is that? It’s badass!!
I’m gonna go find a real tutorial and two old bikes now...
Imagine trying main frame whit it
This video was awesome! Nice job Seth! I would love to ride that thing around LA
Riding this thing on an actual trail is borderline psychotic. I applaud you Mr. Bike hacks.
Please jump this lol edit: no f*ckin way man that’s crazy 😂
I think I would look better with wider bars like 1200 mm bars
you made the right mistakes and learned the right lessons from them. no fabricator cringe here.
I can't believe you're using they pressed v brakes, first thing we do to them in my shop is bin them. Good fun build tho!
There's an old mini series on RedBull TV called "Tallbikes will save the world" telling a story about a team of brothers making crazy and wacky bikes, mainly tallbikes but also a trike with a dropdown kicker at the back. Really a blast to watch.
was wondering how to get on/off :D
Seth is so short that that is really just a large
Was waiting for you to send the airbag
Drives me nuts to see that white fork...
Someone's gotta try the slopestyle course in that beauty
one must stop when asking if they can, and ask if they should...but why?🤔 i just dont get it and as a kid had a 10 foot long chopper, with a scooter frame and small wheel for a front end.🍻
Time to tear it apart and strap on a carbon wheel set, fox forks, dropper post, carbon bars, electric shifting, disc brakes, enduro tires... Overall make it as ridiculous as possible. Then maybe a trip to Florida to show it off.
@lucabmayer7
why is everything "mechanical" a she to americans tho ... a boat is a she a car is a she a bike is a she  a drill is a she ... is it because they give us trouble too ?
But can you Wheelie it?
No one is crazy enough to take it to the trails  Seth be like well it's kinda sketchy so why not 🤞
I wish Raven was the co-host of this video
I wanna see you try wheelie that bad boy 😅
⚠️ Put a guard on your grinder and use appropriate PPE. Those discs can explode and send shrapnel everywhere. Imagine the damage to a person’s bare throat… yikes!
What?  No dropper post?  LOL.  Great video, as usual Seth.
The fat tire tower bike was pretty cool too, looks a little better.  Who has bigger balls than Seth?!?! Getting air on that thing at his age….wow. Super impressive. I’d never do that LOL Love this channel
imagining seeing some random psychopath on the trail with a bike like this is incredible.
Now jump it
Shout out my boy Raven!
This bike is to good at being a abomination
Should change the name of the channel to Seth hacking bikes lol
Hey Seth! I built one in almost the exact same way as you did a few years ago! Mine is sticker bombed and had a tractor seat welded to the front for an extra passenger which helped with the wheelie problem!
When your favorite Youtuber's joke bike has better components than your primary mountain bike... :D
How do you stop at traffic lights?
Seth looks like a child with riding that bike
Very interesting video.
i like how its been 3hrs and its already got 51 thousand views and only 6.4 k likes
Dude, I know you didn’t have experience building a tall bike but I think you did really good. 🤙
You could fix the balance by going bike packing with it - put a full size hiking rucksack on the front
Great build man, love it. I've seen a lot of tall bikes that use a smaller front wheel to correct the angles so one doesn't loop out. They also don't usually run a front brake out of fear of going over the bars if they have to brake quickly.
Tall bike is back!!! Where's the OG though?
Cool build!  I want to see the full geometry specs!  Pretty please?
Try XC bars to shift your weight on a climb
Add a seatpost dropper 🤣🤣
I would of used two cruisers. More vertical angles
Do you still go critical mass? I still do and I heard about from your channel 🙂
This is fantastic.
Sir, love the video, however, There is room for 2 more bottle cages..hence...a six pack...then IT SELLS IT'S SELF (Follow me for more tips lol)
"the mistakes and learning experiences were too tantalizing..." words to live by.  Seriously.  So many people are afraid of failing and don't know how to gain from it.  I wish I learned that lesson earlier in life.
Lol, send this bike to Sam Pilgrim
I was waiting for him to take that off the drama drop
You jump that thing again, and you're going to wish those four bottles were all filled with whiskey, to numb the pain and drown the sorrow.
Just for the jump shot it was worth it lmao, seems so sketch to jump with that !
Holy crap I was amazed you took it off road then you sent the jump I almost dropped my phone. Wow!
Sam pilgrim wants that bike 😂😂
Man, a trek 820 in Brazil worth a lot :/
I'm thinking mounting an old school 26" frame on top of a modern, longer wheel base frame, perhaps even a 29er frame (but with 26" wheels to make mounting such a steed possible) could help mitigate the geometry issues a bit.  Of course that would put the top frame BB shell on top of the top tube of the bottom frame but some trusses and gussets would resolve that weak link.  Well done on your beautiful creation!
Seth had some steel balls to descent   On that thing
could you put on three cranksets and one normal pedal arm? So: one on top (left) which is connected to a second one on the bottom frame 1:1 and one the right bottom frame so you would not have to think about the chains rubbing?  also maybe you could then have a derailleur in front.
You should be able to use the big ring/middle ring combo if you move the upper crankset chainring to outside of the spider, as if it was an outer big chainring, which will fix the chain line.
I yelled NOOOOO and STOOOOP a few times when watching this video.
Seth we need more videos! Just discovered your channel a week ago and im hooked. I've watched all episodes of Flip Bike 5 times already. I can't stop, I need more content lol
fabricator here i didnt mind being put though seeing your welding but it all looks solid and youve cleaned it all up really well. great job
welds didnt look amazing...
The only way to treat a junk trek!
Cen he build a snowbike
How many bottlecages should we put? Yes
tha welding man omg lol
FURZE!!!!
Hay Seth, when are you going to get a Penny Farthing?
Sick content dude 🤩🤘🔥
The look on Seth's face when he landed that jump and was just trying so hard not to eat it was my favorite part🤣
I've been using a bike like this as daily commute for almost a year and it's made cycling to work go from boring to being the best part of my day. It's so fun riding it, and even more fun to see peoples reactions to it. 10/10 would recommend
I died when you said 4 bottle cages! 🤣
That fatbike video brought me to your channel. Have been watching since. You could bring the center of gravity forward by using a smaller front wheel but I fear the driving experience wouldn't get much better.
My brother has been telling me about the "dead baby downhill" a group of cyclists in Seattle that get together and ride downhill with lots of baby dolls and what not , lots of double decker and other cool customs. Only ever seen pics but I think we're going this year.
The faces you make at the end when you are riding it on the trail are priceless. It is a look of pure fear and regret and also happiness.
lmfao Seth's concentration face!  awesome vid
Anybody make one of these dual suspension?
i want to see a full suspension version of this
0:01 AMOGUS
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY, TALL BIKE
This mf really just put a box drivetrain on a tall bike
I asked my GF if I could build one…. She said “where would I store it”
Seth finally finds out what a person of normal height feels like on a bike. 😂😂😂
Maybe a quick fix could be a 20 inch front wheel?
That’s awesome! Lol 👍🏻
Cool, welcome to us 6'3+ our ride height on a regular mtb Seth! ;) Jokes aside, I'm a bit worried about you with a tall bike in your hands lol. That's gonna be sketchy
Another freak bike for the collection
Tall Bike vs High Roller
"So we are going to do it bmx style" LOL I died with this 😂
I was just thinking about making one of these the other day. Now I have motivation.  I thought no way he's gonna hit that jump on that thing, but he did.
did i here drama drop??
Beautiful bike Seth. Way too low on the sketchy factor for your headline. I was expecting you to mount the forks of the top bike to the existing handlebar of the lower bike... now that would be sketchy.
If the gear reduction is too much, put the vertical chain on the middle cog and the normal chain on the big one.
It's missing some colourful lights ;)
I love how absolutely ridiculous this looks sending off jumps in the woods, incredible
Learned yes, entertained yes, looks like a double check there
Gnarly Seth!!
Looks like something those clowns at burning man would build.
awesome, looks like you had fun with this project
Now you play foot down
It would be cool to see seth on a mountain trycicle. with a chair. and suspension
You won’t make a triple decker
Creativity at its best.. Amazing.. Loved it thanx brother
pov when seth has the height of a normal person🤣
How about a Penny Farthing Mountain Bike?
Get an offset seatpost and flip it to move the seat forward then a longer stem should bring you forward enough to prevent the lifting!
Time for a 120mm stem!
Could you find a creative way to fit TWO people on it?
Seth just demonstrated why ACTUAL (not just virtual) seat tube angles are so important for people with long legs. Welcome to tall people problems! If you're tall and always feel like your front end wanders, like you're sitting "above the bike" instead of "in it", or you're constantly wrecking rear wheels...take a look at the actual angle of your seat tube in respect to the ground. Many manufacturers advertise a "virtual seat tube angle" that accounts for the offset of the bottom bracket from the junction of the seat tube and down tube, resulting in a misleading number. On an XXL frame, with a 210mm dropper post, a shallow ACTUAL seat tube angle puts my tailbone almost in-line with the rear axle on a modern mountain bike.  I suck at wheelies, so this is sub-optimal and I'm so glad modern geometry trends err toward longer wheelbases and steeper STAs.   Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk and I hope Seth slams that saddle as far forward as he can.
ITS BACK 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Imagine going over the handlebars
Love tall bikes, but now I wanna see Seth build a penny farthing
How hard is it to bend mtb forks?
Now that you’ve got the experience, you gotta do it with some high end trail bikes. Just for fun lmao
Hey Seth, next build idea I would love to see is converting a hardtail into a gravel bike
I want to see that thing on the teeter totter :)
You could have put six bottle cages
Next video: Sam Pilgrim takes my tall bike down A-Line
Fun.. Amazing 😀❤️
BMX style!!
I built one of these last year. I get some of the funnies looks driving around town.
Found your channel through the fat bike vid bc i was looking at vids of that boat bc i went and saw it leave southampton docks
Just why?!
Now just put some fox 40s on it Sam Pilgrim style.   What could go wrong?
5:05 BMX style, or if your Sam Pilgrim, multi thousand dollar bike style
I could never build one of these where I live, I’d go a block and have to go up a hill... that’s game over 😂
What a great tutorial
As a certified welder , yea that bike will eventually fail due to poor welding skills as you mentioned 😂. It’s not about nice welds it’s about did you penetrate enough 🥴
very entertaining Seth
i am a welder and this hurts a little XD
This video was brought to you by Bodgitt and Scarper and Heath Robinson.
It feels like you got back to your roots a little bit here  Nice!
This made me laugh before I even watch it
Jumping a tall bike... INSANE. maybe put a big heavy rack/basket on the front to add some counter weight lol. There's I guy that rides Chicago critical mass on a 3 bike frame tall bike. Dude climbs it like a ladder and really has to anticipate stops but he can also see over the entire group lol
How scary was jumping that? haha
Seth very impressed with what u did this time keep it up
The absolute balls of steel that Seth has to be riding this thing through jumps
Seth you are crazy but creative. Haha. Keep it up.
It’s nice to see you trying a size large bike!
Pretty cool, I'd like to try riding one, may just make one too
I bought one a couple months ago from this old school circus type, pink rocker dude.  He has a bunch of them that he built and I got it for only 25 bucks ! It's awesome and gets attention like no other bike in my collection!
10:16 - I swear, I'd come there and try to tabletop that bike just so I could get a picture and make it look like I was sitting at a dinner table w/ people.....  Hell w/ that bike I could recreate the Last Supper.    🤣🤣🤣
Have to admit I was very surprised that you hit that jump. Now paint that fork.  Sweet bike mang.
I've seen tall bikes before. I've seen them in parades, critical mass events, and an odd solo dude on the river trail... But I have NEVER seen one bunny hopped over a log or sent off a ramp off road! Well done Seth! Ha! That was fun.
Best way to get rid of pedal strikes….build a tall MTB!!! You’re braver than me hitting a jump on that thing.  Entertaining video!
This is what happens when Seth gets bored
A mongus bike?
Ahh yes, the buggeriest of all the welds. Only the best for Seth 😅😂
Check your medical insurance is up to date!
Could easily just put a larger gear on…. Use the middle gear as a spacer
Pls do a roadbike but with a suspension fork.
You've got three huge triangles in a frame so it might be a big battery capacity e-bike... If you know what I mean😏
i love it, i love it..i love it!!  always wanted to try a tall bike.
We imagine you riding this double deck bike on really gnarly trails  hitting those berms and step ups...🤣🤣🤣
This tall bike ended just amazing 🤩!! Inspired me to build my own tall bike 😁. But I'll try to build a 29", and just to add the information, I'm typing this massage here from Santa Cruz do Sul - RS - Brazil! 🇧🇷
Beautiful Job
Took the r/xbiking crowd on a roller coaster ride with that Trek. I think we got there in the end, though.
Tall bike is definitely a better name for this than double decker, wonder what it would be like to produce a proper two person double decker bike.  Maybe a little cramped for whoever is on the lower part.
Cool and different build for sure, i like it!
Actually, the bike tendency to wheelie probably has more to do with being so high in the air. A high center of mass leads to much more weight transfer during acceleration or deceleration, so the bike will be much easier to both wheelie and endo on during pedaling or braking respectfully. Be carful out there Seth, we don't want you losing any teeth!!!
Seth built this so he can finally be at the same height as people on L frames lol
My dad build a couple during the mid 80's . 1 built out of road 10 speeds and the other out of 50's Era 20" Schwinn's for me.  Dad was a local legend with the big bike at bachelor parties and town events until it was stolen in mid 90's.  People still talk about the "high-rider"  to this day , and I re-created it in his memory a few years ago.
Tallbike fully would be cool😂
Even launched it a couple times! Hell ya
Kinda looks like my minivelo, but weid
I know for a fact that seth wanted to ride this through berm peak but got restrained by his wife and about 3 other guys to stop him from sending the teater totter.
Hehe little man big bike
Glad we're seeing old Seth level sketch again!  Keep it up!
I would ride it 🤙😂
when you got on that thing for the first time I felt like a dad watching his kid ride a bike for the first time. scary AF!
Cool project...But to take it to the trails and jump it was crazy!
That set up jump on the double decker I swear is the sketchiest thing you've ever done and that's saying something lol. Great Video!!
Can I buy this from you? I am about an hour from your house in Lenoir.
Leo Rodgers recently built a new one as well.     If any of you haven’t seen him on IG or you tube.  Pretty inspirational.  Lost his leg and is now doing some cool bike stuff
Next thing to do with that bike so it wont wheelie easily  Use a forward offset seatpost, slam stam or use drop bar, gotta keep the weight forward  And oh yeah 8 bottle cages!
Do a segment on folding bike next.
Seth builds a tall bike just to know what it's like to be normal.  All in jest.  I'm fairly short too.  I think the tall bike turned out great.
Do 3 bikes
Build a full suspension double decker.
Maybe fill the front water bottles with lead shot or something heavy to hold the front wheel down!
next project a full sus double decker? hehehe
I love the videos which take us back to the origins of this Channel and Seth’s bike hacks.
This is the most berm peak tall bike ever. It's nicely-ish welded (compared to other tall bikes I've seen), he has a quill stem converter "for options", it has a box drivetrain. It's definitely not the normal tall bike jank that I've seen around!
Love that you made this video. But also Hate that you made this video because it makes me want to go cut up my bikes and stack em on top of each other 😂
The throwback tho
And they ask why women lives longer than men
this video reminds me another cool channel that i used to see every day: seth bike hacks
What about that cookie jar holder as a bottle cage
Negative stem and a backsweep bars would work on it for the weight distribution.
not sure if I would ride it let alone Berm Peak it!
I can not believe you jumped it. Amazing.
Can't wait for the inevitable crash into tree's , seems to be his MO
What, no pucker plank ride?
I thought you were just crazy, Seth, but you're actually insane. Sending it on a tall bike?! 🤣 Nice.
kinda wonky but i like it
A grinder and some paint makes me the welder that I ain't!
You should make it taller and add lights
put a massive 1000000 mm fork on it
seth youve lost the plot
Old school "Chopper bars" would have been sick on this build... but, would have moved your weight even farther to the back wheel... nice build!!
Wicked awesome fun!🤘
The injuries would be crazy if you hit a trail with this
Yeah.... Seth building a "tall bike". You do know that is just a bike for the rest of us? :P
So if the gear conversion is so low, why don't you just switch the ring from bigger to lower one and shifting gear to the bigger gear that should be better as you have much bigger room in the shifting
a true Florida man activity
Now let's see how it performs around Berm Peak 🤣
Mike levy would be so proud with all those water bottles
Hey Seth, how come you don't just sand the bikes with the stickers on, wouldn't it just turn to dust like the paint?
Pretty cool
No wireless dropper post for when you take in on Berm Peak?
Very nice seth! Love to see you take that through the snake pit lol
Funnest episode. You’re the man Seth
I was freaking out for a sec until you moved the chain tensioner to the other side 😆
need to have better bike on top at least for stand over and lower bottom bracket and a dropper. man that would be sick. stick the walmart bike on top of one of the crappy ones.
I remember the old video, man the nostalgia
Do more fat bike surfing!
Time to do some sketchy stuff, do-dah, do-dah...
You're so cool
Banger
Nice job Seth and cool idea. I had a feeling that it would be "a little playful" when you first climbed on it. The seat was almost over the rear axle. Maybe an offset seat post and a super long stem?
You're going to give your little dog a heart attack always running after you
That was hot watching you hit jumps with your frankenstien monster bike lol
should have probably used a smaller woman's bike for the top bike. it would have made it easier to bail and being smaller should have hopefully helped prevent wheelies since it is really back heavy since you built it around making the steering work like a regular bike.
you are a legend
Awesome!
It needs some mountain bike parts 😆
Put a Sram AXS on it!
Fun Fact: This bike is just the size of an XL flame. That is why no one else is shown in the video
9:05 That helmet is not safe... I can see the dent in it.
You're not even going to try popping a wheelie...🥺😭
Cool
+10 for hitting that jump 😨😂
Just beautiful 😭👍🏻
I DONT KNOW about bikes.. so my q is.. why creating the double chain mechanism? couldnt it just go from the pedals diagonally to the back-wheel?
Next video... how I rebroke my ankle on a tall bike.
Hi I'm Seth "I build crazy things ""I also enjoy Ryding said build things "I also have a death wish ""today we're going to do something kind of different but kind of the same"  But he's funny he's amazing and a legend
I can't help but think that the chain tensioner should have been mounted aft.
Dude awesome first build... Can't believe that you did some jumps.
I enjoyed this video, but I only clicked "like" because of dog content.  I'm a simple person; no dog = no like.  Please take that into consideration when making future videos.  Thank you.
This was my favourite video so far
You should make a Berm Peak stem cap, and install on every bike you enhance or mod or flip . Replaces the stickers, and gives a unique flavor to the bike
Do carbon framed tall bike 🤣
Can't believe you jumped that thing! Impressive!
Nice first attempt! Came out great!!
you didnt paint the fork to match?
Would love to ride it Seth but I’m scared about the dismount!
110% hydration satisfaction guaranteed
Sam Pilgrim approves.
I'm just a little sad why you didn't paint the fork.
Whew, hitting that jump made me secondhand nervous! I can only imagine how puckery it was for you.
Seth, I frequently learn something, and am ALWAYS entertained. Thank you for the wonderful content!
What! bunny hopping a tall bike? Insane! Actually pulling it off... skill! Nice video!
Got a link for that stem adapter?
There’s only one way this can go: double-decker recumbent.
Love this kind of content Seth.  Have a great day!!
I think you should try making your own hardtail see how it goes, I think it would be awesome!
The jump at the end ahahaahhaha
Noooo! I have an antelope 820 and I love it lol I was hoping that was a teaser for a swap bike build
Who else wanna see him send it down berm peak
Sooo... next double decker is gonne be a fully?
Watching this video I keep thinking... "Seth gone die." :(  lol.  Don't die Seth!
WOW 😳. That's cool crazy
Put the Web catching things on it and do the chain as one long triangle 👍👍😁
God damn this is awesome, i eventually wanna build one aswell and its awesome to see the famous Seth build his own tall bike.... Keep it up Seth you're awesome
Long bike coming next??? 😃
dang seth, thats a lot of cables, could have gone a lil over budget and get the D1X shifting set to use with the box 3 drivetrain, would look sick
Bro !!! I was just thinking this week that I wanted to make one of these bc I saw it on Pinterest and it seemed sick and now you made a video about it. It’s a sign that now I have to make one !
Thanks for the nice content, you could try to do a recumbend bike...
I missed old Seths Bike Hacks style wild bikes. Hoping to see more like this.
You should have made it as tall as you Seth.
Finally, the ultimate hydration pack alternative!
Horrifying,thinking about jumping a curve with it, you got balls sir to ride that damned thing
Make the front wheel smaller so your more forward
Too caught up on whether or not you could, didn't consider if you should.
The tensioner was on the wrong side at first, I'm glad you fixed it :)  Those tall bikes are super fun to ride, and easier than it seems at first!
I love your can do attitude Seth! Looks good! Im excited to see you build a DOUBLE-DECKER FULL SUSPENSION BIKE NEXT! Maybe just do some more practice welds first, you will pick it up!
The best bikepacking pike there
Look he’s using the pipe cutter
Excellent!
i am fairly new to mountain biking and this channel has been very helpful and has been saving me from boredom when i cant get on my bike. :)
I would love to see how it performs on the teeter cannon and snake pit
Could you have sandblasted the frame? Cool video once again
i would like to see you build a tandem bike
Nice to see Seth trying out a large frame
Seth falls while going up hill, then just decides to go off some jumps 🤣🤣🤣
You should put an axs kit on it
I was sad to see that Trek 820 hacked up. Could have been an Xbike.
“It just feels cool being up this high”  @ 5’7” I feel your pain
Next week's video "I took my double decker bike off the teeter cannon"  Come on Seth we all wanna see it
The really funny part is that this was "Something a little different, but kinda the same"!
I'll just Stick To Cross Country Bikes and Road Bikes
That original video was such a classic Seth’s bike hacks
imagine what it would look like if he some how got two fox 40s on there😂
I would add a second rear wheel to make it extra long
yawa gi pang trail lagi
Turns out this is a normal size bike for the rest of us.
Best video ive seen in a long time. Epic content Seth
It was at 3:32 that I remembered… Seth was a tech guy, not a welder 😂 Just busting your balls, man! 😁
Just an excuse to have a bike where Oscar can't get at Seth's ankles while riding 😉
Hey seth quick question when i replace my chain do i also have to replace the cassette
Seth, you are a Sketchlord and i love you for it!
Don’t ride it!!! And he proceeds to…send it.  That’s a long way to the dirt from the seat.
just need to put some roadie stem and bars om it
Years ago I had a friend get his Santa Cruz downhill bike stolen. We spend weeks driving around neighborhoods with hopes of finding it. I ended up building a tall bike so I could cruise by houses and see over the privacy fences to look for it.  I got quite a few surprised looks from people in their yards. Just a head floating above the fence line endlessly scanning for his bike.
Love it Seth!! This is awesome
I think Seth is running out of ideas his videos are boring and cheesy now
Look who is using a pipe cutter!
Bit disappointed only 4 water bottles could of fit at least 4 more cmon Seth
Watching you jump that might have been the most terrified I've been watching your channel.
Hey Seth, do you ever try a bicycle with sidecar before? And I always notice your dog run and follow behind you while you are riding your bike. Why not build (or try to buy) a sidecar and attach it to a bike so you can ride with your dog or a person beside you
Nice! you should make a triple decker bike!
Slow the wire feed and get closer for a cleaner weld
Seth should go mountain biking with this bad boy and slap some expensive parts to it
when you tested it there was no barend!
Well, next time, use a third bike to make the wheelbase longer and avoir the wheelies
maybe try to make one with a full suspension bike as the bottom frame....
Such a tall order to mske this, but you sure did deliver 🙌
Hey Seth could we have more R/C content please
Was there a duller color around?
its almost my b day
The bottle are too heavy, it's obviously why it wheelie. You need to add 4 more fixed on the back wheel.
Love it!
We need to see if this is the same size as Connor's bike from GCN...
This is all building up to Seth sending a penny farthing down berm peak
Sam pilgrim type vid
Damn, you have to make a full suspension version with hydraulic disc brakes
Please make videos building hardtail under 1000- 2000 dollars.
Cool build.  I like it.  Entertaining. 👍
another motiv? thats was the bike shop prank brand of bike. what are the odds dang
Isn't tall bike for Seth just an XL frame? 😉
I’m glad your bring back the old video ideas, keep up the amazing work.
Well, this was a weird episode of flip bike 😆
Instead of water bottles in the bottom triangle, you should put weights to keep it on the ground. Be careful. If you let someone heavier than you ride this, they might flip the bike backwards.
A beautiful throwback to your time in Florida!
I've seen people that uses a cut up quill stem to center the tubes while extending the fork, and uses tube of the same diameter of the fork tube.
Now make a hardtail tall bike and send it!
i would have liked to see him wearing some protection whislt riding this on a jump 😱
As wasteful as it would be, it would be so cool to see this done with nice bikes, 2 super nice alloy frames, carbon wheels, sram axs, fox 38, carbon cranks
The real question is if you can wheelie it!
You're insane!
You should get a dropper 😂 be taller
Imagine he sent the whale tail 😂
This reminds me of the one Sam pilgrim had, that was truly EPIC!!!
I love watching your videos and I might make a trail in my yard.
Those clips of seth hitting those mini jumps with this bike looks sketchy as heck man lol
Oh god I actually winced when you launched off that ramp! That is so sketchy lol
Hit the Air Bag jump on it.
that one guy at critical mass in london
Aren't you supposed to flip the bottom frame upside down to prevent having the seat so far back?
This is the most high end tall bike that I've ever seen
Backflip pls
Imagine your a delivery driver delivering a box components box for the 200th time of the year and you just see Seth on a bike that's almost as tall as him doing wheelie's while Oscar is running around him like a madman
would love to see a fox front suspension on that. or the fort with the same colour as the frame!
seth you madman, i love it.
Ipas and a handlebar stache by next video?
The overall geometry reminds me of my folding bike, what with the wheels being that far away from you and all. Maybe a "full-size" folding bike attempt next?
I think it needs more bottle cages
that bike is awesome i need one too haha
Can u put axs girs on it. It wil be healerius
Crashing on a tall bike was fun too
Why did not paint the fork as well?!?! :D :D Yes, it's a Frankenstein thing, but doesn't need to look like one. :)
Ride it over the maim frame.
Pinkbike is gone be pleased with the bottle cages! Well done Seth.
Waiting for the next video when Seth puts on disk brakes, a suspension fork, dropper post, and more bottle cages. Then actually gets maimed on the maim frame.
Can't believe you jumped it!  🤣
Time to shred on berm peak? Also if you aren’t done building on berm peak you should build something like a sicknick table but it’s like off to the side of the trail. You can stop and sit on it and it’s out of the way or you can hit it.
S
Now you now how riding for us normal size riders feels like 😂😂😂
I see a few guys riding these where I'm from.
You can get at least 2 more bottle cages on there!
I can not believe you ripped it down the trail and whipped it off a jump, insane!
Cool project, stuff like that makes you a better fabricator and that’s what it’s all about..thanks for the upload..:)
It looks like you could swap the middle chainring to the outside, same BCD unlike the smallest. That would reduce the gear reduction and you would keep the clearance.
Awesome work, couldn’t  believe you would actually jump it but in hindsight ofcoyrse you of all people would , love the fab videos with the welder, let’s see some more!
Tall bikes are such an urban coastal city conception. Coastal north Carolina like the obx has probably never seen a tall bike on its board walks
So, I'm never gonna build a bike like this, but it was so interesting to watch. It's a fascinating bike style, never seen one irl (afaik, not a thing here).  Question tho, theoretically, would it be possible to build a bike like this, as a Downhill MTB? If so, it would be fun and interesting to watch that too!
What happened to the dolomite
This is fun
Thats amazing. You should try a longer stem to lean your center of gravity just a little further so it doesnt flip backwards.  Thanks for your whole Channel, i can't express how much fun I have watching your videos
Love the bottle cages 👌🏻
Awesome job, Good Sir. Entertaining as always!
I was expecting the comments to be, "Take it down the trail!" I should have known you'd do that yourself.
BMX bikes have integrated headsets now. That's how we install press fit bottom brackets! I also think the tensioner was on the wrong side of the crank. Saw you changed it.
Bro this is So Sick ❤️ Love the part when The setting turned from Your Backyard to the Trail 😅
You gotta either extend the bottom frame or slap a smaller wheel up front. I have a front rack where I keep all my gear. Keeps the front down pretty well.
In this video: Seth tries the Ben Cathro POV.
I’m just out here wondering how the heck Seth jumped that bike
Do the mainframe on it
Great...now I want to build a tall bike.  Because what I need in my life is more bikes...lol 🤣😂
3 bikes next??
hahaha
Different - oh but kinda the same! Next up, a recliner...
Now this is gold
Can you build a Pennyfarth next ☺️❤️🚲
i'm very in the middle between "there are enough guys on youtube building dumb shit" and "Seth's so cool he can do anything and i'll watch it, awesome he dabbles in stuff and that came out cool" feel like you could have made it into a much longer video, or a series? next up you'll try 2x2 wheel drive?
Having random fun with bikes is what keeps Seth so youthful :)
Next episode, Double Decker Double Full Suspension mountain bike.  It has to work...
This is possibly the worst idea I’ve ever seen, I want one
Hey i have a tool tip for you try useing a plastik razorblade for sticker removal i use them at work when we have to remove a nasty sticker and i love them
It's just so uncanny.
Sick
another great video from seth at berm peak, hope to ride my bike there someday!!! looks great dude
another bike to send down A Line
You could try putting the huge rear sprocket you made a while ago on the back because its already hugely reduced due to the chainring mess. just think it would be funny
Send that beast to San Pilgrim for trip down a stairset of doom
When I suggested you work on a tandem bike, this isn't what I meant.
Somebody ring up Sam Pilgrim to give this a go. He should be in Canada at the moment :D.
Cool
How in the world. This bike have a better groupset than my bike
9:47 finally the anvil sound effect song is back
It needs a basket for your little buddy.
I know a legit builder of these bikes, and trikes. If you need one hit me up
Very coole
Add a front basket for Oscar to help with weight distribution. Or maybe toss Kevin in there.
Now put a dropper and clipless pedals on it 😂
You should build a tandom bike
put a dropper on it!
Hi I have been following this channel for so long I really love you’re content it’s exiting like when I see you have posted a new video I get exited to watch it ok have  a good day ps I would love if you Pined this comment it would make my day
Now Seth can know what being tall feels like!
I remember the video that you did good boged job 👍
What would it look like with MORE bottle cages??
The sneaky change of the chain tentioner from the back to the frontside of the chainring 🙂
good job
That’s sick !!
Surprised you didn’t put the growler grabber on that.
Hell yeah Seth, love the ideas keep it up with your crazy amazin ideas!
That treck is a good frame
Reminds me of some other bikes I've seen by other people. Looks great
Please can we see a video of u and what u think about those e bike...People call them electric scooter over here something u can get any fitness with it ..is that true?
Hey Seth what do you think of motorised bikes?
I had a Trek Ant-El-O-pee back in the day.
Hi Seth! Love your videos. What camera do you use?
As Sam Pilgrim would say: Like a Dream!
Tearing up the trek. Perfect for all those trek nerds out there.
If you ship that to me I dont need a manual machine
He should ride the slope style course
Hello Seth
I don't even know how crazy hard to balance those
Take it down berm peak!
1 minute ago
How do you get off the bike
HellYeah, bro. This video is awesome!!
How do you get off
No views and 2 likes lol
Hey Seth, your videos have made me so much more passionate about mtb, I am now entering races, and can name every part of the bike from the ground up, love the video!
