Can't wait if predator is here in dbd
Manifesting they introduce the predator to the fog fr fr fr
Hopefully nothing happened to Jonesy
This deserves way more views. Absolutely underrated
Now we just need Predator....
She looks fucking nothing like Weaver😂
Can you do a predator now?
1:37 they coulda used a extended version of this for the chase music wtf
I swear to God dead by daylight needs to remove the damn bots If a survivor disconnects let him disconnect' I need the Survivors to have a harder time looking for the damned doors!
I have new killer JASON FRIDAY THE 13TH
ı hate that pitch alien predator is better also we want predator PLEASE+-E
I hate the fact that the modelers weren't even trying to model Ellen Ripley's face like the actress Sigourney Weaver, The only time they actually tried is with the Stranger Things characters.
The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers maybe? And include Trish and Darry too?
A year+ later and now knowing FNAF is coming in the summer, I can't do anything but hear FNAF jumpscare sound @ 1:43  THEY'VE PLANNED IT FOR YEARS.
What's next?Shark from Jaws?
pero el gatito esta bien?
I just noticed this, her holding her chest when she wakes up is easter egg to Alien 3 where Ripley was chest bursted, so it wasn't her feeling her heartbeat it was her being "I'm alive? Why am I alive"
would be cool seeing Predator as a killer too ngl
Why don't they do  trailers like this anymore?
now they need the Yautja/Predator and the Predalian and the Xenomorph Queen and it's Alien VS Predator, love it
Guys i return to play, i play ti this game at first, i commenti u for give me alien and after years u give PLS GIVE US THE THINGS!!! mayebe copy the surv....
The girl from fortnite

I absolutely LOVE playing as the Xenomorph.
I missed 😐 but l   been the killer is🌚🌚🌚
Martinez Richard Gonzalez Brenda Lee Ronald
Why would it just stand next to her and do an emote?
Yay, alien has joined in dead by daylight.😊
The queen skin that’s in the shop is actually number 6 from AvP
Will this chapter be in Dead By Daylight Mobile?
Ellen is a survivor she's knows how  To outrun the xenomorph
This is still my favorite trailer, I love it soooo much
Now let’s hope that predator also gets added!!!
Great , now add predator
Time for the predator now
Trash
This is such a misleading trailer lol
10 months later and I still get giddy with excitement seeing the Xenomorph emerge from the tunnel with that amazing crescendo.
Im so happy this is in the game now and xenomorph has become one of my favorite killers to play.
They BUTCHERED Sigourney Weaver 💀 looks NOTHING like her or Ripley besides the hair and outfit.
So when's Predator joining? Come on we all know it.
1:09
Hey fellas from dbd, this is my favorite game ❤ of all times. U did an impressive work. Since 2018 I play this game went up to stars❤
Make the last of us chapter
lol the xenos are so small like the size of the xenos from alien vs preadator movie
Such a great trailer, such a boring and shitty killer
I’d be over the moon if they did Predator next
Ripley looks a bit odd in my opinion
Bravo Sebastien Croteau for making it into your dream world! not everyone gets to voice their childhood monster! From Death Metal to Death itself lol
This looks insane! I need to check this out :D
Too bad the gameplay isn’t like this
Too bad the game is nothing like this in game😑
Alion isolation game 2 Release Coming soon..
If only new alien films were this good...
Any chance we get an Elizabeth Shaw, Daniels (alien: covenant) or Hicks, Hudson legendary skins for Ripley?
Pls Predator 9-9
All we're missing now is Barney The dinosaur.
Wonder what salty when players played Predator?
And then, we waiting for the predator in the future.
1:05
Do Friday the 13th New Killer Jason Voorhees new map crystal lake and New Tommy Jarvis
No Jason Voorhees?
You know there's a dead by daylight trailer of Chucky right?😊
Where's Springtrap lmao
Add five nights freedys Chica and foxy and freddyfazbear. And some of those. They should add the Fnaf in dbd
Awesome Trailer
You know who would make a weird out of nowhere but potentially really fitting new killer? The Pyro. I know it sounds weird but these trailers always remind me of Meet the Pyro.
I only wish this was it's chase theme
next predator or terminator
Me super encanta la licencia!! El trailer no salió tan bien como otros.
Bro where face hunger?
At this point, this Game is Fortnite X Mario Party
Lol the Alien just Vented
So well done 👏🏼
Que emoción ❤
They definitely did it, guys!
I never get tired of watching this trailer, the music, the dynamics of the video is glorious. Although Ripley doesn't look like the original actress, Nicolas Cage looks like the same actor, it's a beautiful trailer.
Im gonna miss " It wasnt programmed to harm the crew"
H20Delirious be like:     *Alien Scum* 🗿
Y para cuando depredador
Banned in india   , damn it
Ur fkng game is full with pc hackers
The longest DLC trailer 2 minutes
The most famous line i can remember is “Get away from her, you B*TCH !” 😂😂😂
What I REALLY love of this cutscene - All the 10/10 professional work and dedication on it; visuals/environment/lighting, animation, sound design and music! And, unfortunately, this Ripley looks so scared and vulnerable (just like in the first Alien movies) And that's not a bad thing! Especially near the end, Ripley anticipates...The Worst!
My in-game videos (including this one!) have no audio since earlier this year (2023) I'm on Windows 7 and this is the only game that has audio problems with *Bink* videos...
Un killer de alíen que nerfearon y volvieron más débil,para que los sobrevivientes estuvieran felices,si yo fuera el dueño de la licencia de alíen,les quitaría la licencia por que su juego es una burla
Esperé esto, tanto tiempo ❤
They actually did it
Also, Slender Man is a tall killer creature with a white face and no eyes. Will Slender Man dead by daylight enter the room?🙏🙏🙏
OH MY GOSH THESE KILLERS. ARE SO SCARY 😨😨😨 BUT  I LIKE IT
Plz do this game for free  its like so much expensive in Canada so that cost 39$ so plese do this game for Free Free Free Thank you
Please add demogorgon back for the new stranger things season
Now I wanna see a Predator dlc!
Bruh alien is one of my favorite franchises, i can't even believe what I'm seeing
Can you please add springtrap to the game? Here's my ideas for him:  He uses an axe.  His ability is that there are multiple springloc suits around, and when survivors are injured, they drop remnant. He can bond his soul to a suit to teleport to it, or he can take a helmet of the suit, and when a survivor is in the dying state he can put it on their head, and they have to use a crowbar next to it to get rid of the helmet, which will take no time, but will alert springtrap.   PLEASE ADD THIS I NEED SPRINGTRAP IN THIS GAME
I don't care how many times they remake,i will always love the alien franchise everything!
I'm late to the party, but I don'y care. I'm glad Alien is finally here after so long and so much speculation.
So this means that this is where Ripley went after her death
When Jason
Great trailer! Does anyone happen to know who's behind the music starting at 01:47?
i need full nice aliens or avp game madelike starfield...no addons specials for other games . no a full cool game ^^
BHVR Remake the alien! At the moment the alien is Demogorgon and Nemesis and because of this it’s boring to play
Let’s goo I have been waiting for this for a while but is the alien good?
Películas así son chimbas "'"' eso parecen muñecos hecho por computadora"'' hacerlas con artistas reales es lo mejor""" ojalá no la sigan cagando con películas de muñecos "" 🇻🇪 siete estrellas
Is this dbd?
No fucking way…
Sick
Will we see the Predator?
Alien III never happened. Confirmed.
Alien Franchise:  Been around for a long time. DBD:  Let’s make a map and characters off of it.  FNAF:  Been around for 9 years. DBD:  *still hasn’t done a collab with it.
I have a Questions to pigs head trap
Remember to keep the light on in your room, whan playing this game
Plz insert in dbd record ranking of the players and replay mode
I have a feeling this game is going to get a bit more sci fi from here on out.
Wait...is that supposed to be Ripley? It looks nothing like her. At all.
Lindo ❤❤❤❤
I have a question. How is Ripley already dressed up when she exits her sleeping pod, and why does she walk out and not require a space suite? if this is taking place right after the first one, and the atmosphere processessor has not been yet built, how is any of this possible? lol
I just love the quality of the video, the animations and how accurate the models are, it's perfect.
Shit killer there’s no counter to him as a survivor, you look hell just use his tail and if u run away he’ll just catch up and the flamethrowers are completely shit since it only takes one strike to break them.
Aquí debería salir depredador para dejarle a Alien quién manda aquí
How do I play this? Is this just a expansion of the original dead by daylight game?
Wow It’s so cool
Now thats out of the way, meaning we are all losing Friday the 13th, the people at behavior should consider bringing Jason Voorhees, and some campsites, this game needs him and even his mother as a killer tho i prefer jason more
Now what we need is the robot killer from the series, the working Joe and our lives will be complete.
WE MAKING IT OUT THE NOSTROMO WITH THIS ONE BOIS
*insert Tai Lung voice* Finally! A worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!
I thnik. We did a good job so far
... Seriously!?... What now spidermother want to pet an ALIEN?
Bad Quality.
Weird
One of the greatest franchise used for one of the most shittiest and simple-minded game ever. Celebrated by the simple-minded mainstream. Good Night.
TERRIBLE MAP infinite loops already just around middle map wtf bvhr. mft going in circles it needs a nerf no skill at all. NEED TO FIX KILLER HITBOXES IN this game u can't give survivors movement speed they have no skill already cause they already get movement speed around terrain, give killers smaller hit boxes like survivors and make this game more balance even then it still favors survivors.
Alien: Isolation 2 looks great!
I'm soooooooo happy that the Mother alien is HUGEEEE!!!
OMG, totally away from the original Alien vibrations. This is some garbage a'la teenage slasher, not Alien.
I think that the chase music in this trailer is so much beter then the live verson
난파된 상태인거보니 영화 3부와 다르게 ..  생존에서 시작하네. 흥미롭다
Now we need a Predator in dbd
I remember when I bought this game on Steam Windows 7 which was its original supported platform but I can no longer play it unless I upgrade to Windows 10/11 which I don’t want to do. Why must I get screwed but the people who have this game on PS4 don’t need to upgrade to PS5 in order to continue playing it?
For the next licenced killer, please add The Terminator with legendary t-800 and Arnie (Human) Skin :).
what happened to the cat?
Very good, 異形欸，好像是異形戰場那只，不是異形聖約那只的感覺，話說電影的異形覺醒和異形5呢？😮
No new ideas anymore.
now i have a reason to buy me finaly this game
ayee my boy jones made the trailer! awesome😺
Now we need predator 😂
what about jason? 😢
OK, I can actually see myself re-downloading this again just to play this expansion!!!
Not so goosd as i expected
Why did the alien not kill her instantly? Why did it make sure to pose for the camera instead of going for the kill? How did she outrun the alien through the corridors? How did she know there is the thing on the wall to release the steam/mist? How did she know the steam will stop the alien?
Next will be the PREDATOR.
i cant believe u need 7 year later for alien lol
Legendary Franchise 🫡❤️
GOOD SCARY KIDS RUN AWAY........ BEC THAT SOUND ALIEN........  WELL DONE  PARENT:.................[IS JOT FOR CHILDREN ANYMORE BEC IS TO SCARY]
wtf lol i rmb i joke about alien and predator years ago when they released some totally not horrible killer.
It's game over man! It's game over!
So they got aliens now, but no animatronic.😢
Ok so hear me out. We want the game to be scary again so drop the Nun, I know y’all gotta get copy rights and all that blaah blaah blahh drop it you came this far anything is possible so make this idea possible trust me it will bring the game back alive and scary like before. Put us in a mansion because it’s more scarier inside not out being outside is not scary it gives us a sense of freedom and we don’t want freedom we want to clutch our pearls. Put the front door as an exit gate but don’t make it look like the normal exit gates make it look like a door a double door specifically. Second please make it dark with broken upstairs doors third MAKE IT SCARY! Y’all been lacking on the horror quite often it’s getting tiring I know y’all know how to do THIS! Then I gotta wake up to this? It’s scary but who the hell is scared of a big bug with legs bruh I’m already exhausted with life
Congrats Behaviour, W after W!
I hope mr.h nate can see this ...Lots of elements of both alien movies...There will always be alien&aliens with Sigourney ellen ripley this is i dont know...that,s not fear
They’ve milked this game so hard
The view from the Aliens eyes although incorrect looks cool. ✌️
Lame
Hey dead by daylight devs  You should create a guts from beserk skin for pyramid head and have it so he has his helmet on and off for two different skins  Kind regards one of your biggest supporters
Game is 10/10 cat
Great work BHVR, this looks fantastic!
Alien isolation 2? Ripley not beautiful and too much artificial action timing
Am I the only person who thought it was the monster from RE4 ?! 🤔
If that's supposed to be Ripley, they've done a terrible job.
They couldn’t even try to make that look like ripley? Alien isolation nailed it
Matt Damon soon?
"Because just one of those things managed to wipe out my entire crew in less than 24 hours." -Ellen Ripley
I loved how survivor ran and alien got confused and started to play to the wrong direction.  This is what happens when writer writes himself  into a corner.
DEADBYDAYLIGHT
Just give us an Alien Isolation sequel already
Nice, now we need the T-800 or the T-1000 as a killer and this game will be more than complete
Epic ❤❤❤100
No interest in playing the game but this trailer was dope.
I love this style of cinematic, soo much better than the cartoon hand drawn stuff
Finally, A Dead by Daylight game that has me at least interested. The super-fast jump scare movement is a bit immature, though
Next well be Predator and Dutch aka Arnold Schwarzenegger
DBD Ripley: outruns the Alien  Alien Isolation: GET OVER HERE
That is the absolute worst looking Ripley ive ever seen... and yes that includes the 90s arcade game.
When she encountered the alien her face says it all; fuck not again
Overpowered. I think I will play TCM whilst everyone has their fill. Nerf needed 😂😂😂
i hate alien so much he is so overpowered please nerf him or just delet him from game PLEASE
So.. when will come "It"?
Big W , biggest collab ever Hype Hype
Now we need the terminators like the T-850 and the T-1000!
If only Ripley would look like Ripley.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Will Predator eventually be in the second Alien Chapter?
If Alien made Roster,  is it possible we'll see Predator also?
-Hey, mom, can we get Alien: Isolation? -We have Alien: Isolation at home.
I hope Amanda Ripley is a cosmetic in the future, it’ll fit considering she’s from a game as well.
Fix the fucking flights. I've been trying to play several times already, but instead I'm catching FPS drawdowns and bynys for several hours. You better watch your underservers the way you darn anime skins for characters
Yeah I already had the great fun to play against it. (Was not fun) those turrets are just a GIMMICK.  You can'T Vault overanything (his tail reaches all the deepest parts of your arse) trow a pallet tail hits yah. And if you get lucky your turret will knock it out its power. But he regains it super quick, in his tunnel... And they are good at tunneling. The experience has been subpar at best.
Any chance of getting The Creeper put in?
Genius!
Jonesy is safe, right?
It's so fukcking cool :D
Dbd u guys should nerf windows and flashlights its really bugged pls fix it thxs.
Basically, what Alien 3 should have been 😂
BHVR PLEASE ADD SPACE SUIT FOR RIPLEY!!! ❤ ITS MY DREAM! LIKE IN FIRST ALIEN CHAPTER!!! JUST IMAGINE SPACE SUIT ON NOSTROMO MAP ITS INSANE! AND ADD PLS FACEHUGGER CHARM IN DBD “ ITS MUST HAVE BEEN” IN THIS CRAZY CHAPTER ❤❤❤❤
THAT is supposed to be Ripley ?????? Erm.... okay
U need to nerf the alien a little u can’t counter it in any way and that’s bullshit
When is it realseing to console
This is the Succesor of Alien Isolation?? Hell yeah
I expect to see predator at some point
2015 tech released in 2023
Next predator please
Let’s go! Might have to hop on now
Why is it 12 it's just 2 character
Well my goodness!
Need The walking dead dlc.
Крута
So I hope to hear the Narrator’s voice for the spotlight trailer
Might tickle my Alien Isolation itch!
If y'all add the predator as a killer please put Dutch as a survivor, just saying ❤❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Alien with no Riplay (Sigourney) That random person is a F,, JOKE , WTF  ..
How about showing us actual game play? Waste of time.
So it’s releasing today right
одно и тоже
Yes! I wanted this for so long!
Why’s it not out?
glad to have a demogorgon replacement for my steam DBD account!
Wait...  is this an alternate universe type thing?!?  A nightmare?!?
Predator next i beg of you
Jonesy 🥰🥰🥰
Ostia que guapo! Ya era hora de que pusieran un asesino en condiciones. Que ganas tengo de enganchar el ordenador
The alien would have gotten her if he hadn't try to seduce her
I'm gonna play new alien chapter.
The Entity just brought in an eusocial parasitoid. It is vicious but lacks actual need to kill.
Awesome guys. Good work.
anyone know what time tdy this come out?🧍🏽‍♂️🫦
Fun fact: the reason why the xenomorph stood beside riply and didn’t kill her was because they were teaming on one survivor and xenomorph saw her toxicity and chased her
Joke 0:19
We've yet to see a DBD killer armed with police baton or halligan breaching tool or any other tool than can be used as weapon
Ok let's see what we can see
Why is she not in her underwear? I thought they had to be in their underwear to enter hypersleep.
Bruh I thought it was the 28th
Total waste of time. Everything is predictable, just copy of movie with rubbish music and effects. dead project from the start, imho.
1. That's not Ellen Ripley 2. The atmosphere on LV426 is unbreathable at the time of the Nostromo's descent to the planet. 3. The "alien" is in fact just the bug version of Cameron's xenos. The Alien doesn't jump around, bunny-hop, or pounce. It doesn't need to. 4. Xeno has the foot structure of the dog-xeno from Alien3, NOT human based. How many stray dogs are running around on LV426?
$ik 👽
Can u add fnaf when the fnaf movie release
Waiting for that Dead by dayligh + cryptTV season
Alien and Predator are my favorite monsters since childhood...
I have been waiting for this moment 😌
Че та как та слабаватенько!
Garbage
FINALLY
We need A Quiet Place!!!
that's fucking amazing 😮
wow a trailer where a monster jumps in front of the camera at the end. original.
I'm a simple man, I see Ellen Ripley with Xenomorphs and I click...
Hey will we ever get a killer and survivor from the World Wars with Shell shock or a Stone Age killer and modern day survivor ? What about a Conquistador and Aztec killer and survivor dynamic?
Alien version of predator hunting grounds.
Inaccurate. She's supposed to be in her underwear.
that, has no interest.It's Just stupid.
Imagine if they added the newborn alien as a legendary skin
All we need now is predator
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The only thing that bothers me is how everyone is calling The Xenomorph a he, him. They’re queens, they are females. I’m killing everyone with her for the disrespect
I'm immediately getting this when it comes, this looks fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That will be so fricking good! :D
This trailer slaps hard. The crescendo at the end with the Xenomorph coming out of the tunnel was super neat
That doesn't look like sigourney weaver at all.
This looks Epic!!!!
“Ellen Ripley” looks absolutely nothing like Sigourney Weaver. They must have not been able to use her likeness.
Love seeing something other than some homo crap
What a dumb idea... All this time making dumb add ons for games that have been plauged with online cheating and hacks when you could just make a new better game. But at least we have another knock off for a game that's dying bc it needs knock offs to keep it functional. Loved the game at one point.
Recently I saw a video about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre variant of Dead By Daylight, and I thought it was proper intense and that nothing could beat that, well this has proved me wrong. The dark claustrophobic intensity of this is going to be quite mind blowing if it's done well 😯😳😄
how did it take them this long to decide this would be a good killer idea like wtf
Think I'm gonna have to start playing dbd again
Yeah, they actually did it I watching the YouTube this year now I’m happy with your dead by daylight😉
so many killers this game gets, but this game is sooo old now and clunky and everything looks derpy, we need DBD2 with modern graphics and game engine.
nice but needs plenty of polishing!  Face too dark, logic failures etc etc etc
Ez a trailer elég lapos. Nem tudom hányszor láttuk már ezt filmen és videójátékban. Imádom az Alient, mert ez a lény a szörnyek királynője, de a játékkészítők témaválasztása nem a legkreatívabb. Újra és újra ugyan azt a csontot rágják le. Hagyják már békén az egész Ripley családot! És a Predátorokkal is már eleget csatáztak a xenomorphok. Csináljanak mondjuk a Prometeus filmnek a világát alapul véve játékot. Érdekelnének az Ősök, meg a alien kitenyésztése is a kedves android által. Sokkal több és nem lerágott potenciál van ebben a témában.
Moneygrabber
I remember dreaming about this YEARS ago.
Wooooooooo 😂
I'm so excited!! And on my bday too
Why don’t they make movies with this kind of dread involving the Alien or Predator anymore? It’s not hard, simple story, build tension, 90mins survival movie, makes hundreds of millions, wins back fans. Simple.
This is a win, I haven't played the game in awhile but I'm going to get this DLC
Is this in the game?
Thank god no more monologues when you load into the game: Gabriel Soma: "It wasn't programmed to harm the crew." Nicholas Cage: "There's nothing more powerful than imagination."
excited but doesn't quite look Sigourney Weaver enough...Please add Bishop as a survivor as well!!
Doesn't look like Sigourney weaver in the face dope overall hope the map is big
Alien FTW
she slept in her clothes this time
Клоуны, чего только не придумают что бы в эту онлайн помойку играли! Анти чита нормального как не было так и нет! Кстати, "героиня"(в трейлере) не похожа на Сигурни Уивер от слова совсем!👎👎👎
Okay. I`m hooked!
They absolutely nailed everything about this trailer! Especially love how they captured the essence of Ripley and the Xenomorph💚
O MY GOD !!!  WOUAHHAHAHA RIPLEYYYYY !!!!
Dud thats insane. Everything i wanted just be realesed SOON
I wonder when will Springtrap from Five Nights at Freddy's get a shot in this game ... 😭
Yayyy more xeno
YESSSSSSSSS
So they're finally doing this?
now they need predator lol
This looks freakin awesome, as an Alien fan i approve.
When is it out
Oh, I thought it was an Alien game but it's just an Alien-themed DLC for a multiplayer game... shame
Bro if dead by daylight made a movie it would amazing
Wow
She really tried, definitely did better than I would
I wish they added killer bots so i can play custom match with any killer characters I wanted
This is the one thing that I felt was missing from the game.
new Alien İsolation game
The eyes of the Ripley are so weird...
Cunts are wallhacking sort this shit out first
looks lame.
I JUST WANT ISOLATION 2 .
Spiritual successor of Alien Isolation ?!  Hell yeah !
I was actually planning to dress up as Ripley for Halloween! Sweet!!!
Cryosleep in coveralls and boots? LOL
That MF just vented 💀
Looks very amateurish. Today's developers lack a lot of skills.
Please bring back the diamond shaped interface of the in game chars . That huge line across the screen is so unnecessary. Or just make it as small as possible. It's just way too bulky
This video is only
H.r. Geiger would be proud
What is 0:55 ❤🎉😊sounds like 0:55
Broadcast😅❤❤😊❤
Buying it when I get the chance
Amazing ❤
if the next chapter is not fnaf i'm going to cry
You've made a joke out of all the great characters, you go ahead and ruin this one too.
Oh happy Halloween everyone 0:22
The chase music needs to be in game that gave me ABSOLUTE CHILLS
They get dehydrated
I want to give my opinion about the map and xenomorph. ( Yes, i have seen how they play on the PTB) Honestly, im dissapointed.  I watched every movie with aliens xenomorphs and to see that the alien goes into a rabbit hole it kinda pisses me off, he used vents or other small tunnels but in the ship. I expected that he will move with vents and when he leaves it, he will drop from it or epicly come out from the vent like in the game Alien Isolation or movies. Memento mori (im dissapointed too) i was expecting two types, one with tail and second with his mouth (the acid doesn't count because you can't hurt a killer). Only his power is awesome, hurting survivors with his tail. The map... it was horrible except looking into sky, the sky was beatiful. I thought the map is gonna be a ship or other big closed place and not half open. I don't know why did you make a half open map but i think it was made to not see peoples comments where they complain about closed map.  I expected a closed map with vents or other tunnels from the ship, and for other maps he could move in sewers or something else, im not happy with current state of the tunnel. That is my opinion, if someone have better things in mind, please comment. (I used google translate for help, because i s*ck d*ck)
Can't wait to see how the movement is when playing as a xenomorph
I really do love the chase music man its such a good throw back to the Nostromo.  Like you can't have xenos without a self destruct alarm that just doesn't sound right
No gameplay = worth nothing. And what's with her face? It's weird and the animation is meh. The graphics look good otherwise.
Now we need the killer rabbit from Monty Python & The Holy Grail
When can we play it i mean i dont see shit on my steam or dbd
They just need Jason
Are you incapable of catching cheaters? Or are you unwilling to catch the cheater?
This seems amazing
I wish chapter 30 was amnesia the dark descent
Dopeeeee
Wow nice video
ITS COMIN UP! WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
When is it going to be coming
Art the clown in dead by daylight
That xenomorph was too close for an escape,and was too slo when running down victim,if that was alien isolation   She'd be dead.
Even stole the title text sequence..  It's okay to come up with new ideas. It really is. This universe is giant and potentially rich, idk why it's the same damn story over and over and over and over and over and over.
Yawn.   Let's mutilate this frachise even further with unrealistic bullshit stories that dont even fit.  If an alien came that close to you, you'd be dead. The end. Fuckin bullshit ass cinematic trope shit.
I was hoping for a game not a service
Whoever thought a randomized, unbalanced progression system forcing you to spent 80% of your XP on shit you don’t want in a highly competitive game that relies on you having strong perks was a good idea needs to be fired. Can’t tell you how many times I considered picking this game back up for a night or two but didn’t because progression is so abysmally bad.
if the xenomorph has a predator-alien skin, I think i'd have a nostalgic orgasm.
If they could just make an anime with these same graphics and put a storyline together, that would be incredible
Sort your fucking cheats out in the game it’s been 7 years. I love that new content is coming out but if you guys spent as much time investigating cheats as you do wanting our money for new content then the game wouldn’t be riddled with hackers/cheats
If they out alien in the game, i want predator too!
Just missing the Predator now to complete
Why isn’t this in mobile tho?😢😢😢
When is it coming out on ps4
my kid
Dead by daylight makes zero sense to me, ain’t no way Michael Myers, aliens, demigorgans, ghost face, Nicholas cage, a pop star and a twitch nerd would be In sum loop from a spider god
Hope they add amanda ripley aswell
When does it come out
when comes predetor?
They need the terminator. T-100 or T-1000
Next should be the predator
Trickster don't need balance changes he is rn on „B" tier on the list so he is balanced. Dont touch him
This is what some of the movies shouldve been more slow burn suspense . At the End i wish they show  a space craft landing  and the Engineers come out as some type of Sequel
Hope Game will be better with new update (Shame not have change region )   Pennywise or Ghost Rider should be more fun (Add please)
Will dbd mobile receive the Alien update too?
Squirrels Usually Nap, Seeking Great Spots, Occasionally Digging, Sometimes Hiding Every Acorn Really Thoughtfully
I waited 6 years for this and it's finally happening!
This is absolutely amazing!
Console?
yessssssssssssssssssssss😊
Something it Jeson
I'll be waiting for Friday the 13
Give me predator
No fucking way
Am i the only one who was expecting a Chestburster to pop out of Ripley?
do the alien run though? because i think it'll be the first one to do so. though i havent had the game for every long.
AI MEU PAI AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA PERFEITO!!
This trailer is amazing
Why this game is not available in India?
BROUGH I THOUGHT THIS WAS FAN MADE TILL I SAW THE CHANNEL
Alien³ - in the maximum security prison on Fury 161 - next 👌🏻
To ja instaluje dbd
жаль, что в самой игре он говно
Minecraft Warden will be great killer for DBD  Using sculk sensor, coming out of ground, and sensoring sounds and vibration, Every abilities of Warden is just great for DBD killer
Nice video you
As the biggest fan of the Alien franchise and someone who legit always wished for this exact moment I cant describe how thankful I am. Its the same for Saw. Im such a huge fan and having Saw in the game was such a great way of feeling connected towards the thing you love the most and I always wished that the bring the xenomorph into dbd. And here we are, its like a dream came true!!
I've never been so excited for a Killer release before. I've been waiting so long for this and it's FINALLY happened
@Dead_By_Daylight I have been absolutely praying for this Dlc since you launched your game guys. So happy to see you made this classic iconic apart of your series finally. Dead By Daylight feels more complete with the Xenomorph and Ripley.
NEXT PREDATOR!!
Big like for Sigurni Weaver reference
Finally... C A T.
From the looks of this trailer, I would've thought it was an Alien game and not related to Dead by Daylight.
ah yes...hide and seek the game
I wonder if there is a mechanic that anyone killed by the alien has their body host a facehugger and embryo.
Poor Dwight always getting offed in the trailers
Cool, cool. Predator when?
Love the Alien Saga. This is a win for me boys
Why don’t you add the xenomorth in dead by daylight mobile too?
This was a consept 2 years ago and its real now!
Hope they release a Vampire killer someday.
I waiting so long for this🫠🥲😌
Nice that they added the Alien and Ropley.
Thankyou good
Seeing all the excitement around (I was pretty excited too that we got Alien) I don't know if I'm alone in this one. I was pretty disappointed to see just an M1 killer with a tail whip as an M2 attack. It's literally a cross between Nemesis and Demo. But what about the Xenomorph's stealth abilities? Wall climbing? Acid blood? And what about the facehugger? We're just getting a decoration-animation of it in a map that should have been a claustrophobic indoors map in a ship/colony base. The facehugger/chest burster could have at least been included in a mori, although I would rather have it as secondary killer like Victor (Twins). Survivor wise, the ice trap and flamethrower sentries are just silly. Also why does she look high on acid? Lol I'm definitely not buying this DLC though I really wanted to play as the Xeno before I tried it on PTB. 3/10 score for this chapter, sorry.
well done!
Finally
I cannot wait to embody the ultimate xeno 😈
First good killer since dredge
This makes me want to get back into the game. Give us Jason, Predator and Terminator and i'm sold
JASON VOORHEES JASON VOORHEES JASON VOORHEES PLEASE OMG
If then the predetar comes wow
They need to buff the alien movement speed to match the trailer 😈
Are they ever going to get the right alien design I mean you only have to watch the movie or look at the action figures from the first movie to see that the alien did not have dog legs it had humanoid legs only the alien from part three had dog legs because it was born from a dog and ever since alien three they’ve been giving the aliens dog feet why because people are idiots
If when they where running on all 4 they broken paleted that would be crazy
This is like the only game that does the asymmetrical multiplayer game correct
Please focus on the mobile version 😢
Can y’all Nerf LeatherFace Chainsaw? He goes way too far with 3 charges since y’all wanna keep him in the game for whatever reason
Seen gameplay and looks like how the xenomorph felt in AVP for the 360 and ps3, so very good and smooth looking. Makes you feel like "the perfect lifeform" ❤
Ripply ?
We need a 2vs 8 mode !!!!
They gotta put the predator and pumpkinhead
When does this chapter of dead by daylight come out
No steam?
Surely we get an Avatar license, like a Colonel Quaritch survivor or smthn, that’d be krazy
It would be great if they made the music in endgame collapse the chase music from Aliens.
Even though I might not play it on my channel,  this is really cool
That was unexpected
That’s it, man. Game over.
tremendous collaboration, I hope one day they introduce slenderman
I can't believe they got alien BEFORE fixing hitboxes after 7 years
this looks like shit not the characters but the trailer.
wow very nice
Please Add Patrick Bateman into DBD it would be incredible he would be such a great killer he’s name the Psycho he has a blunt axe and a pistol. American psycho 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️
Jennifer Lawrence made this possible
Can we please have Slenderman next in the game.
Map new please
Predator w Night vision see through walls would be insane
I think eggs with face hugger traps would be cool too.
After my excitement calmed a little I thought... wait a Xenomorph has no eyes, they see through membranes on their forehead and bright lights, like a flashlight in the face for example would have zero effect on a Xenomorph.. so I have to wonder how that will be handled. Of course imagine if you can unlock a motion tracker skill to use...my mind would explode then.
OMG! Welp I am downloading this game again. They got me back with this, hands down a TOTAl win!
I wonder how the xeno will be different then demo all things said
I need help I don’t have the update
i love the way this trailer is animated
It’d be so cool if the ending to the trailer made it seem like ripley escaped only for her to die by a chest burster
The crossover we didn’t know we needed.👍
Spolier predeater is next lol
Since we got Alien, we already know that Predator has to come at some point as well
Its made cheesy.
how the hell did the entity tame a XENOMORPH???
Famous ❤
AWESOMENESS!!!!
ok but when do we get springtrap
My favorite trailer yet
Love them, they did it
Right. As a huge fan of the Xenomorph saga. I'm re-installing just for this! 🥰
Dead by daylight why You doing this i wos in the game and IT wos Conect losst and now i gan play 1 day dead by daylight 😭😭😭😭😭
I love this by far the second best dlc in the game wesker will always be #1 but i hope in the future we get a predator killer and Dutch as the survivor that would be amazing
now all we need is either Chucky or slender man very well done bhvr
Plz bring dbd mobile back in India
Parecía que nunca llegaría este dia
hyped
Looks like im gonna be dead When daylight shines
You cannot pay enough for Sigourney, or what? :D
Sad Ellen doesn't have Sigourney Weaver's likeliness anymore (and likely won't have her as a voice for Ellen Ripley) but it's still awesome to know that the most iconic character in the Alien franchise is a survivor in this new expansion.
Didn’t realize people still played this game lol
Hay I don’t know since there probably gonna think about another season  of Netflix can bring back the stranger things characters/ chapter back
For the love of God, can we please get a sequel to alien isolation!
Просто Интересно почему название на русском но все остальное и коменты на английском. Ищу русских в комментариях
Here comes Predator
Game over man , game over -rip bill paxton
my dbd hasn’t updated yet so idk how to play as the characters 😃
It's game over, man! It's GAME OVER! The fuck we gonna do now? What're we gonna do??
Honestly I was hoping for chucky the killer doll to be added the game but I was not expecting for this to be added I love alien I’m so very excited I can’t wait for this to be out on the 29th I’d definitely would want to buy this. and I have one question is it possible for chucky to be added to this game and have the good guy doll factory from Childs play 2 to be added as a map for this or is he just to short for this to be possible?
Sorry to say this but… Among us. 📮
OCULUS QUEST 3 VR 🎉😢
Finally The Time is Almost Upon Us!!
Can you guys make a Freddy be a killer and new map PLEASE
I'm looking forward to the new skins ❤
Game over man, game over!
PLEASE BRING PENNYWISE OR CANDY MAN TO DBD !!!
as both a non player and a non player, I see this as an absolute loss.
please don't delete this chapter
Should have been amazing if they added the facehuggers to kill players unless they go to a cryo machine or use medicine or some shit :( they wasted so much potencial
They should add Art and Sienna from the Terrifier Franchise,  we need a new clown and pennywise wouldn't be it, I feel like we need some one a bit darker
RIPLEY 🤘
allalwinasf
predator next pls
😭 i wish it was August 29 now!
Amazing❤
*(southern StarCraft 2 voice)* “Hell, it’s about time.”
My time has come.
You crazy son of a bitch you did it.
How are you gonna make a Xeno hang aomebody on a hook? How's anyone, even the Entity, going to override their instincts to just kill and multiply?
Okay, so far DBD has been fun, but I don't play the game at night anymore....
👏 🎉🎉
I wounder if alien killer only be able go off sound
Now we need the predator
Now, we need the Predator and the Terminator to make this game even more perfect.
I can't wait to see DashieXP play this
Dude this trailer is actually so sick, seeing that they mimicked the movement of the xeno from the movies for the trailer is just beautiful. I feel they also were able to portray how Ripley would try to escape another close call with a xeno, using anything in her path to delay the creature. Well done bhvr truly a masterpiece of a chapter
Ждём ещё более орного контента от деграт отряда
This trilar is amazing
will stranger things ever come back
Can we get a homelander one please 🙏 this trailer is cool and hope y'all can do more stuff outside the slasher/supernatural genre
We're really going to die Oh my God, I'm really going to scream with excitement
That looks epic
Just imagine this when alien is stop becose of fking palet and 4 Second chance perks from survavior.
this shit is bananas
What happend to the cat
That update gived me motivation to buy dbd again❤❤❤❤🎉  thanks for great game
C'est incroyable 😮
im waiting for jason voorhees  if you like to see jason in dbd like this comment
Looks interesting, there’s a little nod to each of the Alien films in that clip.
Really we needed this❤🔥
I'm naming him Allen
Yeah cool  license  killer  i love alien  but this game sucks  its a realy bad Party game with MMR system...
I will absolutely play again for this
Now we just need the Predator
If you really think about it, we’re getting closer to Jason being the new killer 🙇🏻‍♂️
Only one to say NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEE
Isn't Alien a bit too powerful to be put into DBD?  I would think Predator would make more sense.
We are in a renaissance of ALIEN gaming
Nice
Now they have to have Predator
Some of these comments prove you can never impress a dbd fan 😭 😭 😭
I wish survivors could also go into the tunnels underground and get chased down there 😂
Dang those guys are fast...
With a franchise so amazing how is there such little good Alien content. I hope this is amazing
Cool cool, so when's Springtrap gonna be added?
Like that it's continuation of _Alien_ not _Aliens_
This is so well made, I'm in awe. Easily one of my favorite trailers
We did it Joe 😭😭😭😭
I was not expecting this. It's gonna be funny though to see a mindless killing machine pick people up and put them on hooks.
Exciting 😃
I HAVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS, MIGHT BE MY FAVOURITE DLC SO FAR! TEAM ALIEN ALL DAY
This looks sick
SBMM sucks
As a Guy who dislikes Crossovers and never played Dead by Daylight ever, i see this as an absolute win.
Now predátor need to get in game
Hyped
Nice! Alien Isolation is my all-time favorite video game & I just can’t get into dark descent. This looks promising.
i just want springtrap, is that too much to ask for? (yes)
oh my god, i have literally been waiting for this since i started playing dbd 5 years ago. i can’t believe they actually added the xenomorph, i’ve literally talked to countless randoms on dbd discord about how badly i wanted them to add this. FINALLYY
Cool. I remember AVP on the Atari Jaguar u can play marine, predator, and alien. This game looks promising
I didn't know this game was still alive
🔥🔥🔥🔥 yessssssss finally 🙌
How do you put out more characters and cinematics than blizzard
Har har har
Can u  buy it in game?
Gg!
Return Dead by Daylight to Russian Steam, I want to spend money on your game. Please)
it's bon jovi🤯🤯😨😨😱😱
Dam faster and deadly we done for 😳game over man game over to bad we can’t use fire can’t wait to see in cartoon parody 😎
I hope springtrap will be added later too
i cant see in the game the alien even in the shop what is goin on?
Werewolf?😢
CALLED IT !!! Months ago !!!!  Let’s GOOOO !!!!!!!
They should do predator next.
amazing! keep up the good job!
Next Cucumber Killer that gets Bullied!
I guess I am buying it now 🤷‍♂️
I hope this becomes a thing Xenokitty
Looks good
VR??😊
👍
Best trailer amazing graphics i like it and i am trilled
how do xenomorphs see
It would be soo good if all killers in dbd are movie charahters, we need predator with alien, but good job this looks amaizing
If the white knight appears as the killer and colin as the survivor...it will be a blast (And if you want to know who they are they are from changed*
Now predator
Thats it man! Game Over man! Game Over!!!
Finally some serious chapter!
*Never played this game n never had the desire to..*      *Til now*
Waiting for IT monster 👹
I was a player who was away from this game for a while, but I have enough reason to come back to the game... Alien is always the best
Took you long enough
Jonesy meows and did you know that the last word in the movie Alein is... cat 🍺😻😸😺
You know its gonna be let down by crappy AI.
When the 2 v 8? we need an official one we need chaos
I love the new addition of interactive maps! This is looking to be the best and most innovative chapters yet!
The trailer actually says everything😂🙌🏻👍🏻
This Absolutely Kicks ASS...!!!   Terrifying...!!   way better then ANY of the other versions...    :)
I still wait for fnaf.
The fact I was telling my friends how I wanted them to add the Xenomorph to dbd...I'm so so happy
Predator up next I presume.
Trailer 🔥🔥🔥
Crazy
I'm so happy and so hyped for this. I'm a huge fan of alien
W behavior
Predalien cosmetic 💯🙏🏽
LET'S GOOO
Lol I like how nerfed the xeno is canon wise
This is going to suck and be tragically basly implemented.
YES YES YES
Can you play as Bill Paxton or Michael Biehn?
Aww the xenomorph is cute to me
This game has some of the coolest crossovers in gaming. It's a shame the gameplay is so tedious and boring once the scariness wears off.
I wonder if this is the nightmare Ripley had before calling Burke to ask "you're going out there to destroy them, right?"
When will i be chased by a animatronic from fnaf??
Okay but they are showing Jonesy the cat in the trailer a lot... will he show up in the game somehow? I'd be thrilled!
👍
I love how it cane to fortnite before a horror survival game Edit: I completely forgot about the alien games i meant purely in crossovers
This looks really bad.. too rushed
Behaviour Interactive is the reason why other gaming companies can't rest on their laurels, they will always go to the moon and back to make their fans wildest dreams a playable reality
They should totally add predator to dbd
love the new look
Damn this trailer crazy
Add spring trap
ive been saying they should do this forever im complete
I like so much........This trailer is amazing good
So will the smoke be an actual usable that stuns all killers? Also the venting probably isn't real since only a Xenomorph would be able to use it and only on that map.
jesus christ just give us a damn AVP game already
Hey dbd I know am asking for ah lil to much but please change his chase music
sad the killer sucks ass
Czy ktoś wie jak ustawić język polski na ps5?
I want to play as the cat😢
im going to shit myself
Bro I’ve been fucking waiting for this one!!!!
Far too little and way too late.
When is it coming over to console
Han pasado 84 años 🎉
Great job BHVR, yall fucking killed it with this chapter 10/10
For someone who has enjoyed the Trilogy from Prometheus to Alien Covenant, this is Beauty
i’m really hoping that she’s the next laurie strode
Damn this is gonna hurt with Texas Chainsaw comes out.
Omgee Omgee Omgee!!! This looks amazing!!! ...returning to the game asap
I wish Springtrap was added too XD
I’m down for this, but the community on this game is so bad I don’t want to waste money
Cripes! *This* is the horror game that just keeps on giving!  Suck it FNAF, ya bush league, jump scare dependent, trash heap!
Been playing dbd since it was free on the store years ago.. about time! I'm getting this before they lose the contract somehow
I have 1032 hours in dbd wby ? 😤
This is going to be sick !
Now this is a good trailer
Too bad it's going to an awful game and an awful community.
Dear developers, thank you so much for this chapter. It's really awesome. Fans have been dreaming about it for a long time. I'm looking forward to and believing that you will also add Chucky and Terrifier to the game. Love you. Thank you.
Make this game free in steam
Epic!!
Zero gameplay trailer, so what kind of game is this and why will it be good?
Literally what I've wanted for years
This is a learning opportunity remember this as best friend because I a woman year but Victory far what's again what's again 2:08
Very well made trailer but I doubt the gameplay will match its quality. This just makes me want an Alien Isolation 2 even more.
Since Disney owns both Alien and Predatory and you got one without the other, that means one of two things. A they wanted AVP not  both being on the same team, and said "Pick one" or B. You made a very crappy predator
I don't have Dead by Daylight, but I love that ALIEN / ALIENS is getting more content this decade!
Perfect
Nice
Terminator and Predator next pls
i good but need predator
Love the Alien Model… Not sure about Ridley, more like Ripoff 😂
Нет... Я не плачу... Просто... Просто ждал этого миллион лет.
They say the survivor is Ellen Ripley, but that is absolutely not Sigourney Weaver's face. I'm out.
Can you add cross progression between pc and console please i have a bunch of stuff on console and a lot of stuff on pc and it makes sense since we have cross play now🙏
U know what’s crazy, the chase music in this video is better then the one in game on the low. I’m so damn hyped tho i don’t even care tbh but i do
finally a xenomorph to play.... Survivor Ripley doesn't look like Sigourney??
I never played DBD in PC, and I just have few hours of gaming experience in Mobile (I mostly play IDV) , I just watch pro youtubers playing the game😂  But I always love searching "DBD new hunter/survivor" every month. One of the few games that gives justice to their collabs.  Im just happy seeing most of my favorite horror/thriller/sci-fi characters, come to life again via this game.
Соседи
Still waiting on cross progression
why this game was ban in India 😢
finally <3 and next: predator please
Best chapter because the cat didn't die to the alien
Now they need to add Karen's because they are the most scariest entity.
Predator is next  ??
I'm hoping for an Amanda Ripley skin for Ellen because Alien Isolation is one of my favorite games of all time. I remember watching a YouTube video a while back that explains the Alien's AI in detail, breaking down everything about how it works, and I was fascinated by how intricate and thought out the Alien's AI was. If it weren't for that AI the devs designed, the game wouldn't have been the same at all.  The devs tailor programmed the AI to maximize immersion, as well as control pacing, suspense and pressure dynamically. The AI is even programmed to learn from the player's actions and adapt to the way you play and things you do (not a new concept at the time, but that on top of the tailor made AI just made the game even better).  I love Alien Isolation so much. It is my favorite horror game ever made, and definitely top five games of all time in my mind.
*Wakes up out of hyper sleep* me: NOPE! *goes back into sleep*
DRACULA 🧛‍♂️ ❤
Finally i can actually play alien isolation in the lockers
Beautiful
Dead by daylight, NOW you got another Player.
"I'm not going to lie to you about your chances, but...  You have my sympathies."  -Ash, Alien (1979)
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO!!!! BEEN WANTING THIS FOR YEARS!!!! FUCK YEAH ALIEN
Espero que salga el predator
Can we have 8 vs 2 mode. Just want to see Alien team up with Sadako
It's nice to see that the Alien franchise is still alive.
Waiting for the series for sure it will be a show
Fantastic world Alien
I FUCKING CALLED IT！！ PREDATORS NEXT
W. I DONT even play this
01:06 are you kidding me? WTF?
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now I’m just hoping they add some kind of classic monster like Dracula, Frankenstein’s Monster or The Wolf Man
Im not into pure multiplayer games but the Alien and Ripley are a good reason to buy DBD.
WELL ITS ABOUT TIME!
I prefer predator.😭
So , the entitie have manage to capture an alien, the alien is like Michael ? Not bound to the entitie, just killing in is corner ?
Shit i gotta renew my playstation + asap
Finally a good update hahaha
Nice
If that is supposed to be Ripley from Aliens Franchise then some one needs to be fired cause it does not even come close to how she looks, only thing that looks a little like it is the hair & that's it...
Oh. My. God. Is that Ripley!? No way! We are getting the Alien! I can’t wait to try it
can't wait for The Terminator release
Next Killer Recommend: The Terminator, The Glitch
I don’t even play this game I’m just a big horror movie fan and love these killer trailers lol
I wouldn't mind seeing an Alien tv series or something. For example in Aliens, it turns out that an entire colony was built on top of an alien egg nest and the entire population was eventually converted. That alone would make for a great story line.
We've waited many years for this Alien chapter to come!
I wish I played this cuz I appreciate the shit out of it
Tengo el juego más bueno de ese pero no no tengo trombosis muchos monstruos para conseguir
Avoiding a FNAF collab like they dont want a gazillion dollars
Haven't really played the game and it's not my type , but it feels great nonetheless seeing a game getting constant updates and new stuff added, props to the developers and the people supporting them.
We whanta to add spring trap killer
I love to tunnel as leatherface now i can literally tunnel as xenomorph.
Great animation btw looks so incredible
Yay
I’ve always wanted to play Dead by Daylight for a long time cause i’m a big fan of most of the characters the game comes up in my PlayStation but i don’t even bother installing it cause of my storage someone in my family added more staff into it without asking and now they add Alien now i really want to play this for good
is it out rn?
I don't even play this game but as a lifelong Alien fan this trailer was exquisite.
Now we just need killer klowns
Literally every game they make is better than alien 3.
Predator serait la bienvenue avec schwarzy!
FINALLY JESUS IVE BEEN WAITING
Ok, not gonna lie, this is awesome. Probably best thing you will add to this game
I’m totally geeking right now😱♥️
its not ellen ripley if is not sigourney weaver hehe
game stuck in 40k players... making shit DLC like this one... FIX THE FU"·Ç!)K·ING GAME! and WORK! HOOKS? Really? Hooks for the alien? What total garbage from the developers... would it be so much work to put together a "special" hook for certain assassins?  In this case, it would be a column or wall (SAME SIZE OF HOOKS) where the alien imprisoned the survivor along with his slime... (I forgot that devs doesn't like to work, only add skins and shit killers) It's incredible that people continue to pay for poorly designed crap like this...
He’s in the walls... HE’S IN THE GODDAM WALLS! *”Fortunate Son” playing*
Well I may start playing Dead by Daylight again. Wanna be the Xeno boyo Raaawrr HISSSSSSSSSSSS
I saw Alien vent
Maybe they might do predator
So, is there a in universe explination why the Xeno puts people on hooks, or goes along with the Entity's orders for that matter?
When they had us vote on what IP we'd like to see, I voted for Alien.
Yoooo, Make the next killer Jeeperscreepers 🦇❤
No Sigourney likeness. 🤨
Coming to iOS and android too 😅
Is this real or fake?
I love you guys!!!
boys WE DID IT
Terminator next?
Now we need Predator in this game 😏💯 seems alien is here
This might actually get me into the game.
gg honestly
Should have been spring-trap
DBD really said "if you take our demogor, we're gonna just grab a new one" but goddayum im so happy
I'll have to come back and give this a whirl.  I like being the killer and getting humiliated by survivors taunting me.  I hope the Alien is op and fast
Life finds a way. As does death
Worst facial expressions animations I seen in awhile.  Looks good otherwise :o
エイリアンの中で一番デッドバイデイライト味があるのは実は３だったりする
🎉🥲🎉❤❤
They need predator now
*"GET AWAY FROM HER YOU BXTCH!!!"*
You can tell a  ai genetprated rtailer  as it just seems wrong
I hope that we get as many maps and survivors as possible from the alien universe. The Nostromo is a good start, but maybe we'll get more.
they need to stop adding to this broken ass game. just start from scratch and make DBD2.
ice content
I don't get it... she is scared of the other human? The alien and her face the other human together? Then she runs from the human and the alien gets startled? Then the alien chases her? Im the biggest alien fan but huh? Oh and she has been wearing boots in the hibernation pod, vent gas doesn't harm aliens, and she needed to say something like "get away from me you BITCH!" 😅 whatever I'm sure it will be good
Great, I love it, good idea! And the Trailer is awesome. Just Ripley looks a bit weird.
Can’t wait for the survivor comes being “IT VENTED IT VENTED!”
Brilliant, after playing Alien Isolation and Dead by Deadlight I always figured this would be a perfect fit
Well guess im finally playing!
i have not touched dead by daylight and was never planning to, this might change my mind
I can't lie to you about your chances, but... you have my sympathies...
Looks nothing like Ripley
Female Rambo?
*Still waiting for Terminator*
this is so fucking awesome xenomorphs are like my favorite thing ever
Когда в этой помойке будет обновление с добавлением античита? Если в этой помойке он хоть когда нибуть будет вообще
YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!
판자넘어야지 머하노
I imagine that Ripley gives you access to a scanner that can tell you where the killer is, but it gives off that telltale radar noise. The Xenomorph can probably set Chestburster eggs that can be deployed near generators that have a similar mechanic to Pigs reverse bear traps.
So it's springtrap?
How much alien are he is 9000 gems or 500 gold?
This looks so cringe.
Makes no sense. Xenomorphs are fast, cunning and effiecient killers. Going to look stupid with a Xeno slow waltzing around a map, struggling to catch and kill slow ass survivors. Getting stunned by little wood pallets
All I want is to crawl on they walls, whip me tail, hiss at survivors, and use little mouth to bite as they run from me. Oh no
That’s really cool….. But I want my fnaf spring trap in the game
If they also did the quiet place monster ( death angel)
as a survivor only player…im shittin the bed
The game play will probably be repetitive and boring 💤😴😴😴😴😴
This is a gold move on the part of Dead By Daylight. Another dream come true !
A pity that this game is more competitive than scary
Wonder how ripley goona react to the other killers
The cat is the entity
Oh wow. I am interested in Xeno's power tho
It's just a dangerous animal you run from and deal with. The alien was meant to be a horror with strange and terrible senses, an awful virus infecting a spaceship, this might as well be a chimp on bath salts. Nice graphics i guess.
When in that torch light we have to complete the mission 😬 creepy 🤒
Nice video
I’m glad they used the digitigrade legs like in Alien: Isolation. It looks much better than plantigrade.
They finally did it
Question: knows anyone if its gonna be with shards or with money?
I like it, I hope they have some connections to the face huggers. I feel like the eggs are pretty iconic in the series
major W
Can’t wait for John Carpenter’s Thing to make it’s debut.
It's been over a year I last played DbD, this chapter is bringing me back to the fold. Damn you BHVR.
I am wating Ripley players to torch that god damn thing.
very good DLC but like Ripley looks more like Nancy from stranger things
Next stop, Predator and Dutch
*_Damn, can't wait for this to reach mobile._*
Remember people being shocked about Demogorgan. And now we have freaking Alien!!! You did it!!!
So, so, so looking forward to this! It looks AWESOME! One suggestion (and I know that this is a pipe dream), but it would be awesome some chests or turret pods were randomly booby-trapped by hiding facehuggers. The survivor has a limited time to get the FH removed by another survivor before the FH gets full purchase on their face --> KO via chestburster (much like the Pig's reverse bear trap mechanic).
How about Jason Voorhees Friday the 13th
Easily the best dbd trailer So far
Say what you want about the chapters but one thing they always get right is the trailers🔥🔥🔥
Win
"Game over man! Game over!"
holy crap yes. JUST YESSSSSS
Jonesy😂😂
YESSSS FINALLY IM SO EXCITED
Welp looks like it’s time to start playing dbd again
Dead by daylight team help me with it on mobile 📱 phone I send you feed back on Google play soooo ya so you can fix this update on mobile phones
I really love this soo excited to play it 🤩Can we get the demon from insidious next plz that be really awesome
Very good 👍
Is nothing sacred? First they sold out to fortnite, now this?
Add cross progression for console and pc pls
I know this is weird, but those saliva effects….. dang! They were so smooth! I’ve never been more afraid of something’s mouth before!
No one was talk about the cat. Like... What even the reason it exist in the trailer? Is this to tell us that they are located at Earth? Or that is the entity? They can't put the cat just because they like it, right?
I showed my brother this and we were screaming and my brother was screaming HOLY SHOOT
Please please please be the Yauja next! i want the Predator!
She really thought she was safe when she knocked the board down 💀
Wouldn’t have expected Riley Reid and Alien as a DLC
Please make your game free to play
i want jason vorhess next
Hope they put Predator as the killer and Arnold as a survivor next.
Whos a better puppy? The Xeno or the Demo
I NEED THE RELEASE DATE NOW!!!
They might as well put out The Predator next because he’s literally built for this type of game….hunting down humans for sport is literally what this game is about😂😂😂
Mobile as well?
WELL DONE. 10/10 TRAILER.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
How would the alien know to hook the survivors?
YOOOOO
Maybe if we’re lucky  They might just ad chucky or better yet Jason vorhees
Who buys this game? This seems like a very lazy game
Nice video
We can all agree this is better than Aliens Dark Desent
I love DBD. I play it on mobile!
cool
1:21 why isn’t this the aliens chase music? Especially this part 1:29 when I first saw the trailer I thought this would’ve been aliens chase music tbh
Also when is it realised for ps4
Looks nothing like Ripley 😢
THE ALIEN, IS REAL
Now this is what I have been waiting for!
One single button assigned for 3 diferent actions for all these years Behavior? Why? WHhHHYYY???
The art team carries this game on their Herculean shoulders and no one can convince me otherwise
Fucking FINALLY!!!
Oh, I'm stupid. I didn't even think about the fact that they'd definitely be a move between locations killer. Love it. Seems a little too common nowadays but I always love it.
Im still waiting for Single Hunter Mode like Friday 13th, offline with bots and all killers 🙄☕
When does this come out
The reference is amazing when he goes over her shoulder
Dammit ripley not you too
Tbh it should have been fnaf licencie it’s better plus they are in their anniversary
The very idea that the fucking Alien is stopped by somewhat knocked over wooden pallets, or boards is fucking sooooooooo laaaaaaaaaaaaaame
Dead by daylight is rubbish
if you are willing to do this dudes, ya gotta be willing to do until dawn
MY BOY
PLEASE GIVE US A Corporal Hicks and HUDSON SKINS!!! PLEASE GIVE US THE FULL EXPIERENCE!!! (And damn I wish you guys got the accurate Xenomorph scream...)
Why does behavior make new op killers new op perks but still not buff unplayable killers e.g. nightmare
The collector +1
Cant wait to get my hands on thiss
Shoulda saved this one for a DBD2. Instead, you waste resources funneling endless money into a 10+ year old game. When games like Balders Gate 3 just game out and countless other next generation titles coming what’s keeping you around? This cinematic? It’s crazy how people will buy this just because of a cinematic that looks 50x better than your 10 year old game.
This is very cool, but the alien theme does not fit in the game's theme at all! I think the devs only now listening to players whining and asking for this to be in game, when the playerbase is dropping, is pathetic. I think this is a huge mistake, no matter how much i like the alien franchise. Dont get me wrong but the disrespect for these devs are dropping by each patch.
you think theyll add Jason one day?
Best trailer yet
Cannot wait. Hurry up with the release! I've never been a massive fan of 'runnin', hidin' games but THIS, I can get behind! Speaking of behinds...a suggestion to the Dev's is; fill out that uniform of Ripley's please. I think we all know those overalls fit better than that!
Her face is too chunky. Like make her look like a bad bitch, not a possible Ghostbuster
Mein Wunsch geht endlich in Erfüllung ❤❤❤❤
To bad Ripley doesn´t look like original !
We now live in a world where Nicolas cage can be chased down by xenomorphs. What a time to live in
This games so clunky it doesn't Fit this franchise at all.
IT'S A SHITTY VIDEO MOVIE TERRIBLE
Cool if they act as if Alien 3 never happened, but this did instead.
love all the new killers but im still stuck playing against the huntress n the trapper, is there a way to change which killer u go against? cus i havent played against the new past four or three last killers
Like the killer and the survivor.  I do have other ideas about the people who made Dead by Daylight?  Others The Killer The Vampire - "Lady Dimitrescu" Countess Alcina Dimitrescu (Resident Evil Village) The Grudge - Kayako Saeki & Toshio Saeki (The Grudge III) The Undead - Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th Part VI) The Miner - Harry Warden (My Bloody Valentine) The Proxies - "Ticci Toby" Tobias Erin "Toby" Rogers, "Masky" Timothy "Tim" Wright & "Hoody" Brian Thomas The Operator or The Thin Man - Slenderman The Orphan - "Esther Coleman" Leena Klammer The Puppet - Blade (The Puppet Master I) The Three Brothers - Saw Tooth (The Older), One Eye (The Middle) & Three Finger (The Younger) (Wrong Turn I) The Walrider - The Walrider (Outlast & Outlast: Whistleblower) The Wendigo - Hannah "Han" Washington (Until Dawn) The Haunted - Ruben "Ruvik" Victoriano (The Evil Within) The Werewolf - Captain Richard Ryan (Dog Soldiers) The Treat - "Sam" Samhain (Trick 'r Treat)  The Survivors Captain Chris Redfield (Resident Evil Village) Naoko Kawamata (as a Human) (Kayako's Younger Sister) (The Grudge III) Thomas "Tommy" Jarvis (Friday the 13th Part VI) Sarah Palmer (My Bloody Valentine) Alex Whitaker (The Puppet Master I) Eliza Dushku (Wrong Turn I) Miles Upshur (Outlast) Samantha "Sam" Giddings (Until Dawn) Joseph Oda (The Evil Within) Private Lawrence "Coop" Cooper (Dog Soldiers)
Bruh time to reinstall
hell yea no more hiding survivors hahahhahaha
Still waiting for that fnaf dlc
Oh my, this is just terrific 👏
this exactly what i asked for 👍
I can't believe this game is STILL pumping out dlc. Good for them. If only other companies would take a page from their book
FINALLY!!
Can't wait to be the xenomorph
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Ellen Riplay? So... did you not want to play for the right to use Sigourney Weaver face or something?  Also, why did you squandered the opportunity to have an interior map inside the iconic look of Alien's ship by having it 90% outside, on a pretty ugly and not alienish at all planet? Wtf?
This is the first killer that came out perfect right away in the PTB, great job!
Predator,Termiator!!! please!!!
The time has finally come
I do appreciate them having Ripley as a not so easy target, seeing as that’s her character.
Is kitty on the map?
welp, time to re-download Dead by daylight lol
Zomg!
I want Hannibal Lecter in the game.
Next killer Pradator pls.
Not even alien gona bring me back to this game.
I hate indoor maps. Other than that, I'm good to go.
Great trailer, but there's one nitpick... the Alien would've been able to see her during that first encounter. Just because they don't have eyes doesn't mean they don't have other acute senses.
Alien no es ciego, pero lindo trailer. Te hypea de lo lindo.
She looks terrible
Great!
Someone please take a look at the cat in an Alien planet 😊
"The perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility.   I admire its purity. A survivor... unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality."  - Ash, Science Officer, USCSS Nostromo
absolutely non playable character... that turrets not allow him to use his ability. awful
LETSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
No way! Awesome!!
alien really thought he could catch ellen ripely XD
Am I crazy or the alien seems to smile at 1:40 ??? 0.O
WE WON
The Best dlc ever!! The Best icon of horror in DBD❤
THAT WAS SUCH A GOOD TRAILER HOLY SHIT
개쩌네 데바데
You know I am never going to stop telling the truth about this game right?
You know all of this is just being pushed out hard to distract you idiots from the fact DBD is mass criminal fraud, and racist bullying of everyone for nepotism. Right?
Why does Ripley don't look like Ripley? 🤷‍♂️
great idea depending how it translates to the game...not sure how an alien mooching around at a relatively slow pace will work as they are known for speed,we will see i guess.
It's happening
the animation is excellent but the game itself is a trash
Give us Alien Isolation 2 already!
Developers, change the generator design on such cards. Old generators look generally detached on such maps, make it more modern in appearance.
When Alien Isolation enter dead by daylight.
This.  This is what I've been waiting for.  The day the Entity comes to the Nostromo, traps Ellen Ripley on board, and enlists the Xenomorph as its newest Killer.  That day is finally upon us, and I couldn't be happier!
Now we got Two Final Girls from the 70s :D
They should make terminator but just the endoskeleton
面白そうだがマッチングしなすぎてやる気出ない
Can you guys add fnaf ?
When is the Killer coming to Xbox
Couldn't get Sigourney Weaver's likeness, I see. Still, it's better than not having her at all.
The entire premise of Alien franchise was that Xenomorph cannot be subjugated. Yet Entity managed to tame it. what
I'm guessing Sigourney Weaver didn't want her likeness to be used in the game.
Predator/Yautja when?
Add the cat as a killer for April fools or smtn
Personally idc for new characters, what id like to see are differant game modes.. 2 killers vs 8 players with 10 gens or something to that effect, new maps and so forth.. the standard 1K vs 4S is getting stale for me honestly, regardless of character adds, i mean sure its nice to have new characters and new perks but theres that many now it just feels bloated honestly.
It is amazing
We also want predator.
Great next thing, you know they might put a predator in dead by daylight
Soooo no Ripley or hell even Amanda Ripley... *sees ending survivors name* 🧢 😅
Yesssssss
Omg!!!
I wonder how it’ll work. After all, the Alien is blind
Oh, this is a pretty good question.... Kind of but, I wonder if they'll make any skins.
Amazing. Fits so good into this game.
Might have to get back into dbd now
In space, no one can here me cream.
Incredible!
Thank you, Jennifer Lawrence, for inspiring the whole Alien series with your main role on The Hunger Games.
nice, but why is she ugly? o.0
I mite actually start playing this game now tbh
Next killer, predator
one of the best trailer :)
Re-downloading just for this! Haven't been on in over a year. Let's go!!!
sweeeeeeet
Great to see them. I want to see some mortal Kombat characters in here too
I've been looking forward to this since the beginning of DBD, never had I dreamed this would happen!!!
Now how is the predator gonna find the alien if they can’t get to them
This is the best dlc I ever saw. Might be the one to beat stranger things
Next should be Predator
Ah, taking more of my money I see…..
OMFG YES!!! A xenomorph AND Ripley!!!! I can die happy (after I’ve played a ton of hours of this game)
Holy, its a big step up for the animation team. It like u watching a horror movie. Hat off for animators and devs for this trailer. Awesome work.
Sick! Demo now has a friend to run around with. I’m so excited for this.
Jones!!!!!
I feel bad for Jonesy. Why is he there?
who even plays this game?
If Alien (Xenomorphs) is here, the Predator may not be far behind.
Pretty well done trailer! I don’t even play the game lol
Alien is so above DBD and so is Ripley, and so are heroines/heros like Jill, Ada, Leon, Ash, etc. Cheryl, Laurie, and Nancy Wheeler cohesively make sense but it's irritating having known action and survival oriented characters be reduced to running sims and pincushions for the Killer when they aren't that in their respective games.
Anyway dead by daylight did an awesome job on this killer ! Hope we get more of this.. Thank you bhv !!!
Why Dwight keep dying in trailers?
Imagine what new ground breaking game you guys could make if you quit trying to pander to another audience for more microtransactions
Where's predator when they need one
Finally! A killer cat.
I hope the xenomorph's Mori will be the iconic Tongue destroying it's victims skull  .
Add the Nostromo self-destruct siren to the map during the Endgame Collapse! (Have the Nostromo wreck play it with flashing orange warning lights. It would make the map perfect!)
So a happy game
So... They couldn't get Sigorney's likeness, huh?
Wa... bu... i thoug... I CALLED THIS 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Now we just need predator and we'll be set
子供の頃から大好きだった作品
No need for Alien fan gameplay trailers boiiiss. IT'S FINALLY HERE!!
Absolutely incredible! I humbly request the inclusion of cross-progression in Dead by Daylight. Your consideration of this feature would be immensely appreciated. Thank you!
Aliens  Alien 2 Power lorder vs AlienQueen  Pls 🙏❤
Im kinda surprised it took this long to get this franchise but WOO I'm so happy its here! hope it is fun!
This game is just getting better and better sadly I can't play dbd with my current potato PC .
Please have Ms weaver voice Ripley
Bakka!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg cant wait
great animation, also props to whoever scored this it's really nice.
There better be a face hugger involved
Fans: we want a sequel to Alien Isolation    Devs: best we can do is two terrible action style games and this cameo
Can we get the Terminator ???  I want 1984 Arnold. If we get a vote.
Hope for some facehugger in is skill
where sprigtrap
So…..they added alien isolation to DBD. Gameception?
You guys need to get more creative on trailers.
BRO I SCEAMED MY HEAD OF WHEN I SAW THIS WAS UPLOADED TO THE OFFICIAL CHANNLE!
Now predator and we got it
lomg time coming
Please give the survivors weapons
THERE'S A CAT IM INFINITELY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAT THAN ANYTHING. If something happens to the cat I'm blowing up the game <--- said before trailer finishes  ok the cat is fine.   WOOOO HECK YEAH ALIEN!!!!
Crap, it’s always the most exciting things we have to wait a while on. But it’s worth it.
This just makes me want an alien isolation sequel
Do jeepers creepers next.
thanks, unfortunately we can play as Survivor in custom/ bot match yet Cuz BHVR still havent add Killer bot
I haven't played since the stranger things year but this might bring me back
Man poor Dwight, always being done dirty
I clearly remember the USCSS Nostromo getting atomized. In space no one can hear you scream.
Game over man!!!! Game over!!!!
So I guess the chances of getting an Alien Isolation sequel are pretty slim now...  Also, you guys still stole videos from Samination.
Man, I'm still waiting for Springtrap or Slenderman...
Doesn't look like Sigourney enough
Took them long enough
The killer is still never came out yet
I think about The Thing being a killer, and his powers wold be copy the characters and fake it is a player, also traps like transform in pallets, tottens and chest
Can't wait,the Gorilla alien is cool but also willing to bankrupt my wallet for other alien skins!!
Fuck it I will buy that no matter what
Wait what excuse me what I saw fanmade like 2 years ago, I thought it’s impossible…
I wanna be able to pet the cat on this map, pls let us pet the cat
Ok cool !!! So dope !!! Hopefully a “Predator” monster in the future ? 💪🏽💪🏽🔥
For her backstory, I’m guessing the entity took her immediately after she died in Alien 3.
where is predator
owh she is
LET’S FUCKING GO!!!!!!!!!!!
Dinosaur next :)
It looks like the xenomorph can crawl thorugh holes in the floor and can do i very fast running attack so this will be a very mobile killer it will probably have a big weekness to pallets tho
I pray you’s got creativity permission from the copy right owners and spread light through new xenomorgh mutations through skins or at least give us a predalien. Anyways I’m so happy.
Still more of the same crap. This is a terrible game.
I always knew
Yeah I dont believe its good until its released... colonial marines had a good fake trailer too. And fireteam has really low replay value and predictable spawns and paths.
I m the only who wished that Amanda Ridley wasn t the survivor?
Springtrap when🔥🔥
Wow they really did it Omg 😂
Still waiting on that FNAF crossover
I was never intrested in this game, but now it has my full attention   Also side note: cats have just always been immune to xenomorphs lol   I hope we get some face hugger abilities
I didn’t get the update😢
Can you guy do Springtrap from five nights at Freddy’s pls
This game just gets better and better 🔥🔥🐲
Yes finally a alien dlc
Amazing BHVR keep it up!
Now you now she dead. 😂 Looks scary.
Now, all they have to do is NOT remove it like what happened to Stranger Things. Darn you Netflix. 😡
In space no one can hear you scream...
Cool character added
Not the xenomorph again
I want Jeepers Creepers, The leprechaun and Chucky. I don't know how they would do chucky or Leprechaun but im sure they would figure it out.
The time has come….O_O
This is awesome but tbh I want Matt cordell in this game but alien is fire
I wish we could get Jonesy through the gate! I'm going to have so much fun just chasing the cat around the level, and using the flame thrower to protect him! This has got me exited about DBD again. See you in game! GLHF <3
It would be cool if the alien could have face hugger eggs around the map and if the survivors trigger them they get impregnated and the have to get rid of the egg like the reverse bear trap
Now we just need predator
Hehehehehe
All I’m waiting for at this point is either the thing  mostly for Kurt Russell or fnaf
Been asking for this for over two years now and I am not disappointed
It's funny because now this is the SECOND time that the Xenomorph and Leatherface are in the same game together again.   Mortal Kombat X, if y'all didn't know
1:28 if his chase music sounded like this it would be great
Xenomorph and Ghostface, two fav horror characters
i been wanting this for years and they finally did it😭😭😭
im buying the chapter the second its in the epic store idc if dbd has fully updated yet THIS IS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!
You absolutely do not deserve this liscence.
No fk way now more sad I’m broke person can’t get this all license killer need pay to have
I wish you could choose to be human or alien like the online game back in the 90s
I dont care how good or bad the killer is, I want it for the fact that it's a fucking xenomorph in dbd
Alienware tech ads 😂
Pooog
Maybe I should start playing this game. All these years later and the community appears to be holding strong while the game still gets updates.
THIS IS A BANGER BRO
E.T BILU
Maybe it's time to comeback ti this fucking game
Once again the Big Chap is depicted as short, having overly active saliva issues and behaves like a mindless animal.
"In space, no one can hear you scream." 👽
When's this stuff coming out because i saw people playing as killer and the survivor and went on and wasn't there
Now we just need Predator.
Dope next we need to get Predator
And next, Predator as a killer pleeease! :D
flashlight save while quoting Aliens
Bro why do they make the trailers so realistic but the games graphics are worse 😂
1:00 THE ALIEN IS FACE CAMPING DWIGHT REPORT HIM
BHVR вы такие крутые! Профессиональная работа❤
Oh yeah, it's all coming together 😎
Hey if you guys ever need an idea on who to add next to your game I suggest dead rising they have loads of psychopaths to choose from and main survivors too
so far i am satisfied but i cannot get out of my head the alien should have a ability to run fast at the survivor, my point is while on runner mode the alien should be faster. Would prefer this instead of the whip but i take it, while we dont got a sigourney, but i am happy nonetheless. But...
You just know it's gonna be $30  the way it's been going.    but itll include and Ultra-Rare  outfit that changes colors every time you can't afford food.
We can download this game in Indian server
It's about time
Hot take...  NEW KILLER LOOKS BORING
I love what they've done with this DLC its definitely feels like its own Alien mode and I can't wait to play as the Xeno
They do so well with cinematic trailers and never considered to go for a full 6 months break to make a animated graphical movie of DBD with these effects and technology team? It would sell like hot cakes if put together chronically following a few story plots of each side.
Imagine a legendary verdugo skin from RE4 for the xenomorph could work.
Now all we need is Predator, Jason, Chucky, Slenderman, FNAF and Patrick Bateman. No need to add Pennywise because we all know IT is the entity.
PLEEEEAAAASSE I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS SO MUCH FOR SO LONG BIG SADGE NO SPACESHIP IN SPACE MAP BUT AHHHHH Jake my boi it's been a long run you're nearing 100 but you best bet I'm maining Ripley as soon as you hit 100 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰✨✨✨✨✨
Report ripley for throwing, did not unhook dwight
Now, the Predator
Bruh no way
I love that it's even the classic version, not the ones from those (comparably to the OG) crappy sequel versions.
For once i am proud of you dbd goodjob lads 🥰
…yoooooo…
Why can't the game have these graphics+animations? It sometimes feels like a downgrade when you play the game ):
To see how the alien brings his victims to a hook 😄
Now all we need is a FNAF Collab since the movie is coming out soon.
what's the point of elen ripley without sigourney weaver likings ?
please don't let this end up like the Demogorgon
I really want to fucking die right about now.
Let me guess... another cellphone game?
How is the cat alive?
I don't even play this game and I see this as a win.
incrivel!
this is freaking epic, i love the way this trailer is animated indeed!
I was waiting for this for a long time
won't it look a bit silly to have the xenomorph impale people on a hook
So random question but will there ever be ptb for Xbox?
Poor Dwight its always him 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Demogorgon and xenomorph finally in a video game together, fuck yea
It's Happening! It's Finally Happening!!!
Ripley was much more beautiful in the movies why did you make her ugly?
Yeah im going back to dbd
Cool, now add Springtrap and Slenderman.
The terror radius should be bit more like what we had in the trailer.
I admire its purity
Ive been waiting for this since launch
They actually did it..
Do dbd are planing to add some extra gamemode to the game, so players will have something refreshing as well? I would to see a gamemode where both killer and survival have random characters with random perks and addons.
Pog
Imagine being that close to a survivor and still whiffing... Couldn't be me as alien
Nice to see Alien, I thought he'd have been in the game a long time ago. Some others I think would be cool are :  The Collector The Reeker Maniac Cop Andre Toulon (Puppet Master) Jason Voorhees (Friday 13th) Predator Lipstick Face (Insidious) The Creeper (Jeepers Creepers) Candyman  Slenderman Jeff the Killer Five Nights at Freddies Chromeskull (Laid to Rest)  Mark Hoffman (Pig skin)   Also, now that the Friday 13th game is officially dead and being shut down, it'd be cool if some of the original counselors from that game could be added at survivors in DBD, some are pretty iconic in the genre, and so they're not gone forever. Maybe AJ, Tiffany, and Jenny for the females, and Buggzy, Chad, and Kenny for the males. Could be a dlc bundle or something, maybe then the remaining Friday fans would move over to DBD.
If you renew the Stranger Things license, so I can play that content, I might buy in, otherwise this is just vaporware if Disney yanks the license. Same for the licensed horror characters like Myers, Freddy, Ghost Face, etc. If those licenses evaporate, like is happening on the Friday the 13th game, then all you have are your OC characters.
So the entity basically grabs Ripley's escape vessel after she enters cryo sleep not long after ejecting the xeno out of the airlock. And the entity grabs the xeno as its just floating in space. Ok so that means nowhere in the universe is out of the entities grasp. Oh I can't wait to main the xeno.
My opinion: After rushing for hours against insolent insects, I only have one thing to say, it's one of the most perfect DLCs, it may be missing an OVOMORPH power for the alien to be even more terrifying and adds a good pressure but overall this killer I'm not really disappointed and the same for Ripley it's one of the most fun chapters I've done and when I see that I find that Nemesis in dire need of a rework and Buff  And the last thing, I hope there will be no NERF either killer or survivor, I have already merged a lot of different perks to make it even more fun and have an alien faster than ever and have a survivor very competent in chases, and dying or surviving is not impossible so if there are several whiners who require a surviving nerf or killer PLEASE tell them to FUCK IT!!!!!! AND TO UNINSTALL THE GAME, I HAVE NO WANT TO PAY FOR A DLC AND SEE A BAD XENOMORPH AND RIPLEY THE SAME....  It's the Xenomorph and It's Ripley  apart from that I can't wait to see the skins you have reserved for us, for the alien several difference race WARRIOR, or other color palette in short!!!!  And yeah I'm French not American or Japanese even if in another life I would have liked, especially America  But seeing kids crying for a NERF it annoys me especially when the killer comes from a cult movie and this killer smashes everyone in one BLOW there you have THREE CHANCES TO SURVIVE DUMP
Dead by daylight is like the Fortnite of horror games with all these IP licensing. Now give us Jason and Chucky
Its actually here
Man this trailer makes me want to go back and watch Aliens😂😂😂
What systems are they out on cause my switch won't update my game
La collab che aspettavo da anni questo gioco merita molto di piu continua cosi dbd nn mollare
I'm excited for this DLC but man, she doesn't look like Ripley at all...
Hey behavior i got a question. How did the entity get xenomorph to work for it?
So now we know for a fact skull merchant was supposed to be predator, real shame we got a Kardashian instead
We killers torturing survivors with this one🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣💯💯💯
Se tem Alien, então vai ter Predador.
Hoping to see this on mobile soon?
Nikolas cage stars in ALIENS? face off yeah baby
welp. time to pick it up again
A new map similar to the Demogorgons map would be cool but there will be no new map unfortunately, its still fine though, this chapter should still be good!
NOO WAY
Finally... but very important question... WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAT?
Me and my daughters Xenomorphs are gladly thank you for this great trailer hope to see you add me as Queen in the game i would destroy some powerloaders😏
W
Map and killer-wise, it kinda reminds me of Hawkins lab and the Demogorgon (map = map, and the killer because of the moving around through the air duct (would be portals for the demogorgon). Curious to see how they are gonna turn out! :)
Will there be a physical launch with this Alien DLC cover?
Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?
LET'S GOOOOO!!!
0:51 다 좋은데 김풍 소리 나올 때 현웃터짐
I won't be surprised if they add the Predator and Dutch.
hey guys getting raped literally biologically takes away your mental ability to ask people questions
I am the biggest Alien fan and seeing this makes me so happy!. y'all did a great job on this.
looks nothing like Ripley at all
The alien in this trailer could easily be a Star Wars stormtrooper.
u ate bhvr
Literall goosebumps
why not amanda?
와.. 드디어
As a killer player I see possibly my new main as a survivor player I see a fun interactive player to play against and a great perk that adds so much interaction
This trailer is amazing!🖤🖤
LETS GOOOO
Yes, finally!!! I waited so long for Alien! 😍
We should be able to play survivor as Predator and have have the shoulder gun. Jk
Should have used a flame torrent bozo
Good cinematic, really happy Alien is now in DBD
We did it guys🙌🙌🙌👏
Давно нас не радовали такими красочными трейлерами
Yes yesyesyes
I have been BEGGING for alien to be in dbd, its as beautiful as I could've hoped for
I’m surprised this didn’t happen sooner, honestly
I looooooooove that they added Ripley she's fkn iconic and it was the right move 👏
This is by far the best looking killer. Visually it is fantastic, i am sure it going to be a lot of fun to play.
About damn time, i've been waiting for it since the idea was born in my head.
*quickly runs to download DBD*
This reminds me of Alien vs Predator on xbox
Оууууу котик как мило❤
finally
While I’m really excited I was really hoping we would get face huggers and chest bursters. Having eggs strewn across the map similarly to the tunnels around the map. Could’ve made for a very iconic killer. Feels like Xeno is a remake on Demogorgon. The chase music is also an ear sore. This trailers music was SOOO much better. I appreciate behaviors Nod of approval towards lore and it’s references, but this Videos chase music should be the replacement for the current one in PTB. Gotta mix it up, because it is wayyyy too repetitive. Sounds like washing machines and a monkey beating cymbals together.
Thank you! Keep it up! Predator next please 🙏
This is a freaking epic I love the way this trailer is animated
Excellent
Fantastic! Cant wait for this
Animations and graphics are good love it
Anyone else think The Xenomorph should be able to stand when it wants to While on all 4. and in doing so its power goes back to half way full.
Gotta love the NOT Ellen Ripley the games getting. Apparently Nic Cage is considered affordable but Sigourney Weaver is not.
this is awesome
Absolutely win for behavior,finaly play with bots, and even in ptb the game as running very nice.
Siuuuu
This trailer is amazing!
This is probably hands down the coolest trailer for a dlc ever ❤   So looking forward to this been a day one player of dead by daylight it has gotten better and better and just can't miss when it comes to adding content Love it!!!!
Nice work i am absolute fan  Alien ❤
Il manque plus que predator et c’est bon
and ıf ı see springtrap here too ı can die peacefully
I love how they always show the dynamic between the killer and survivors in the license chapters. It’s nice to see people actually know what they are doing and not just scream and cry a lot.
Big w for this one
That is not a good likeness of Sigourney Weaver :D But still looks awesome. Makes me want to play Alien Isolation again
Totally gonna play this game now. As soon as the update launches and I have time.
Les go alien that hooks :)
I can't believe man after all this time it's FINALLY HERE
音楽といい今回の予告怖すぎる😂😂
I love dbd
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes  OMG, I am so bloody excited.
oh yeah! time to make some room on my hard drive!
Hell. Its about damn time. Time to install dbd again. Its gonna be game over man.
0:22 Thank goodness Jonesy's ok  1:04 "...s'up?"
Yeeeeessssss
Looking forward for the Depredator and Pennywise!!
nancy?
There are those who said this day would never come. What would they say now? Also if I was Behavior I would make the Alien's perks very OP at the start just cause it's the Alien LOL.
Dead Space when?
Thanks devs to realize one of the best chapter Imo ❤️ I love the concept of the xenomorph and the design of the map 😍 I'm so in hype for the 29 August 💪🏻💪🏻🍻🍻 Greetings from Italy 🥰
Wait, Nicholas Cage? and now Alien with Ripley - DBD just keeps going !!
🎉here we go
Bruh...
Great killer, but not eager to see its fear factor going to 0 because "haha, survivor sided game"
Will this be limited time like stranger things
Ripley AND the Xenomorph, instant 10/10 15/10 if the Xeno has the face huggers as an ability 20/10 if we get a map too
Это лучший ТРЕЙЛЕР!!!
was hoping for amanda but this is fine too
Game over man!!!!
The Alien is going to hook people. How lame.
I would never be involved with this and all of you are sick weirdos
Repent and trust in Jesus Christ or hell awaits
this is amazing props to the animation team!!!!!
This is the first time DBD has ever been appealing to me. I love horror but this is not the game for me. However, this is the first time I actually want to see other people play it. So GG.
sooo cool i hope the qween skins comming for alien
So totally gonna get this
now imagine if dead survivors could give birth to a face hugger...
Esto si que es crack!!
It's not free on Android
Never played this game but likes to watch it on YT amd now that my favorite character Ellen Ripley and alien will be here I think I might start playing ❤😅
The cat, new killer
Ty BHVR. Top notch animations,  sounds, map and perks. 10/10
My unreliable prediction for the subsequent chapter : Half-Life 2 where the killer turns out to be 'Civil Protection' and the survivor turns out to be 'Alyx Vance.' ( ⁰ 〰 ⁰ )
Hello, please enter the skin for elodie afropunk, and the skin for the plague, the arrogant virgin 🙏
DbD, y'all, this is what happens when your ambition projects have such a massive influence. I'm still baffled we went from Pyramid Head being first introduced to possible even Jason Voorhees now that the xenos are added with such heavy licensing.
That final shot with the xenomorph looks realistic af
This looks great! I wish they made Ripley actually look like Sigourney Weaver though. Right now she just looks like a generic woman with curly hair. None of the angular or interesting and beautiful features of Ms. Weaver. Really hope to see some improvements soon.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
THIS TRAILER IS SO GOOD
game or movie？
It would be dope if hooks recieved special animation - placing you in a cocoon in front of an egg when reaching stage II larva would attatch to you and you struggle to keep her from inserting eggs into your throat just like holding entity claw when in stage II. Possible ultra rare add-on or offering for Xenomorph enables him to send you cocoon and instantly beeing inserted with an egg that would act like Pig trap you need to reach medical capsule or something to keep larva from tearing away your chest. Or something.
They could've ended it at 1:06 like usual, but they had to continue because this is one of the most awaited and incredibly profound IPs of the horror genre to make an appearance on DBD. They acknowledged us for waiting on this for a long long time.
She doesn't look like Ripley at all...
I like that Xenomorph is easy to pick up and his power is fun to use.
I love seeing all these great horror icons in video games. I can't wait to watch all Alien carnage!!
The chase music in this trailer was better than the chase music in game. The constant droning in the game version is annoying, this one is way more intense. Please use this!
Holy fuck this is gonna be awesome.
There coming out of the walls!! THE GOD DAM WALLS!!
Finally! Now we need Predator 😊
report camper killer, hahaha
Let's go dbd team. I feel like the xenomorph is going to be the next Demogorgon and I love it.
Finally a CREATURE in DBD and it's...ALiEN!!! 😮 Thank You DBD TeaM!!!
I just hope the kitty stays safe
This looks so fucking awesome what really caught my eye was how many ways the alien can get around
Aliens power isn't what I expected it so cool  I feel like he should have a shred ability like Demogorgon because he's alien
JONESY!!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Finally, something to get excited about with this game again.
It's predator next?
"It's another bug hunt."
Can’t wait to play Xeno simulator. Wish the map took place on board the engineer ship, maybe next time.
The animation, movement.-parameters, texture and bonephysic of the alien are good made. But the perks are sadly trash and the tail-attack will be nerfed soon because survivor will complain that the range is to long. The tunnelnetwork makes it to easy to place turrets, but since they are at best a minor hinderness for the xenomorph, they are not really making a diffrence. And what is that prop you slap on the backhead of survivor when they get mori please? That looks so out of place and is with some survivors not even proper fitting with it`s size. Claudett for example.
Dope,comes out on my birthday!
ฉันรักสิ่งนี้มากกก!!!
Yes! Finally, we get the Xenomorph, I'm super excited to play again the Alien and Ellen Ripley looks fantastic, she's amazing and the epic team did a fantastic job on this chapter. Congratulations, I can't wait to play Dead by Daylight. 😊😊😻😻
H.R Giger would be proud
El siguiente que sea Predator
I don't get it, why do they feature a female heroin with a cat like Ripley but it's not her. Come on be creative for once!
에이리언
Toxic that there isn’t a new Alien game…
I'd like to see the gameplay for this.
Сбылась моя мечта и моих друзей)) с выхода дбд ждали эту главу)
Nice if you managed to get Alien maybe you should add John Carpenter The Thing and Kurt Russell as MacReady to your space horror collection now that will be something just imagine you won't be able to trust anyone and keep wondering who might be The Thing putting every survivor in a paranoia state never seen before
YES
Yeah This would be cool  You know they should come out with predator  Jason will be nice too Come on Spring trap
dude I’m excited but I knew they were gonna drop this soon before leather face game drops. This will crush the game and it’s just a a killer release
This so awesome! I'm a huge fan of the Alien franchise, so this just made my day.🤟
Мне нравится
Where's the John carpenter’s? Thing
Why didn't they make her look like Ripley? She looks like a completely different person.
As a killer main with only 3 hours yet having the game for 4 years, I see this as a absolute win
Nice
Parece ser, que no pudieron acogerse a los derechos de imagen de Sigourney Weaver, para que la superviviente fuera identica a ella.
This is incredible!!
Nice 👍
damn, i wish they got sigourney weaver
This trailer is so cinematic and well-made; it's entertaining and gives both the Xenomorph AND Ripley space to shine. You can tell BHVR was extremely excited to be able to do all of this, and I'm just as happy for them as I am for us lol
1:07 i thought the alien is the bodygaurd of the woman
I'm so excited
Woooow 😮Animation so incredible.  I like it😢❤
A perfect organism...
You guys finally got me, ok ok I’ll buy your game now geez!
All of this is a huge YES!!!
Oh Dwight, like I said don't hide in locker again.😆
Criei muita expectativa e me decepcionei, um killer cujo o poder é a coisa mais fácil de counterar. O ataque com a cauda dele já é algo que você precisa ser bem preciso pra acertar e que é algo bem fácil de se desviar, e ainda pra melhorar tem as torretas de lança chamas pra acabar mais ainda com um poder que já é péssimo. A única coisa que “salva” ele é o facto de ele poder andar pelos túneis que mesmo assim você precisa ir até eles algo que vai demorar um pouco e que naqueles momentos de urgência não funciona. Resumindo, todos os meus amigos que jogaram com e contra ele acharam o killer fraquíssimo e super fácil de counterar. Super decepcionado. Se a behavior planeou lançar o ALIEN esse mês pra combater com o lançamento de the Texas Chain Saw Massacre com certeza fracassou.
This game is as old as my testicles but it’s still a massive W
Stopped playing DBD for almost a year cause of sweats but can’t wait to go back and try it out 🔥
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
God damn we need a alien isolation 2
e
This is your year hands down
Cats in dead by daylight im amazed
I would ADORE “alternate” pallets. Like sealing a door or slamming an airlock. But in exchange for these technically more powerful pallets id love to be able to blow through walls instantly like that. But that was supposed to be the 4th launch killer and they decided they would never do it sad
The real danger is Jonesy being there, all the survivors are going to wind up distracted by the presence of a cat
Please get Predator in here too! This is too epic
Alien: Isolation was scary as shit. Hope this brings the same experience or at least similar.
And the next killer will be Predator and new human the major (Schwarzenegger) ? XD😄 Looking forward to it.
That's not Sigourney Weaver, so I fail to see the point of any of this.
By far the best dlc we got so far
Looks more like a Gen z superhero film.
Take my money now! Can't fucking wait! This is epic and awesome!
1:05 no way they put alien getting spun into the official trailer 😭
Animation team for trailers: Top tier Mori animators: Jank as fuck
Predator next plz
Waiting for fnaf collab
They did a fantastic job of showing off everything we should expect our "Alien" killer to do. Most excited DLC by far!
Wooow its hapening??? Its fucking happening???
idk, why this trailer music is more better chase music. 💁
Man I’m just waiting for a Junji Ito crossover/collab, it’d be awesome to see characters like Tomie, The Intersection Bishounen, Souichi, or even Fuchi or Tadashi & Kaori, they’d all make such interesting playable characters for DBD. ALSO DEVS IF YOU SEE THIS BY ANY CHANCE, LOVE YOUR WORK, KEEP BEING AMAZING! 🩷🩷🩷
just watched Alien movie because of this
Ooh I'm really exited for this as someone who is relatively new to the game
Alien...but still no fnaf
크
It's about time
Years of saying Alien or Predator should be added… it was so worth the freak’n wait! The perfect organism has arrived!
Now THIS is the licensed chapter we’ve ACTUALLY been waiting for!!
Fix your stupid game behaviour
AHH i thought it was gonna be a new map dman but still this looks sick
im so happy  for this!
Heck yeah, the xenomorph, dredge, and demogorgan. My three creatures I love.
I wonder if they couldn't get the actors likness... Does not look like her at all..
Let’s go! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I will main both!
Now is mandatory to add the clear arch nemesis of the alien...THE PREDATOR!
Wonderful trailer. Let’s see if the real game measures up to this.
0:57 poor Dwight give him a break  :(
I haven't played DBD in about a year or so...But Xenomorph. I was always hoping for this killer. Time to dust off the killer gloves.
RIPLEY!!!!!!
If you add the Predator and Arnold. It'll for sure be an absolute win.
As I am sure ripely will say..."Here we go again" IT IS ON BOIS!!!!
And they still managed to fit Dwight getting iced into the trailer XD
OMFG, I AM SO HAPPY!!! It's about 3am right now, I just saw this by accident and I nearly fell out my bed. I never thought they would really do this cooperation, but now they did and i am totally in love with it. ❤
do we know whose doing the voices? it would be so awesome if Sigourney was doing it
@Rarithlynx welp two years later they did it.
Predator: If that snake can do it. I can do it too
I love how the trailer looks like a modern game should look but we all know the dlc will look like it was made for a PS3 game. 😏
ABOUT DAMN TIME!!
If y'all at Dead by Daylight can add Alien, you can add Springtrap from Five Nights at Freddy's!
we need that map too!!!😝
We better be able to run on walls and ceilings. IDC if it's broken, the experience would be fun imo.
Please tell me her character will be carrying the iconic tracker from the movie to track the killer.
Grid/No.6 skin when? (I’m happy to say one of these came true.)
ME: I want Ripley! Mom: We have Ripley at home Ripley at home:
It'll be fun to play with until the toxic community makes me wanna leave the game again after a month or so
every trailer we get the better they get
Jonsey and maurice are gonna be bestfriends
Looks awesome!
Alien being introduced has me exciting for Predator soon.
Dang look at DBD now. I remember seeing this account at like 400K subs and now at a mil! That’s crazy. Good to see DBD entering a golden age
Wow, I used to cry for this a few years ago when I was really invested into dbd. Can’t believe it’s here!!! 😱😱😱
Please get predator next, please I am begging.
Very cool, but suprised Face Huggers and Chest Bursters were omitted.
If Jonesy does not loop alongside you, I'm not buying it 😤
PETITION TO CONFIRM THE CAT IS OK OR WE RIOT. >:(
Ripley actually looks really cute , that is surprising considering how how fucked up was Claire and Granny Jil
I hope they put vents on the new map.
Only thing was the classic sound from Alien. You all know which one.
Badass animation
.... isn't there already a killer that does that??? oh wait you lost the license for it. when y'all stop taking L's i'll be waitiny.
STILL BETTER THAN ALL OF THE ALIEN PREQUELS MOVIES. lol😂
Hope they can get around to doing chucky. I know it will never happen but seeing stuff like this gives me hope
I would love to see the carnage symbiote as a killer in this game
Dead by daylight team.  Spring trap    Is the killer from  5 nights or Fridays. So. He could also be added as a another killer.  Next time, I'm dead by daylight. So you can be a new character to the daylight video game. Then try
typical solo que survivor play by Ripley not taking the trade leaving Dwight to go 2nd
It became true
Nerf pig she to op
How do the trailers look so good but the ingame graphics continuously decline
This is literally Alien Isolation all over again, except you play as the killer that can vent. Can't wait to play this love Alien franchise. If the game devs got time they could put in Corporal Dwayne Hicks, or put in Hudson as tribute to Bill Paxton. RIP.
as a wise kid once said  ITS THE GUY FROM FORTNITE!
this may actually get me to play the game
Now all we need is the Predator…
Omg big orgasm! alien in dbd!
Perfect chance to redo that Hawkins lab map
Just from the trailer I can tell what game mechanics are going to be used for this. 1. Xenomorph's gonna have a chute to crawl in 2. Just like the xenomorph, the killer is blind and must use hearing to search for survivors. Survivors must rely on slow movement to remain quiet 3. Steam switches will be like the wooden boards that survivors use to stun killers
Finally🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Now THIS is how you pay homage to a franchise, the alien looks so amazing, down to the second mouth. The map and rippely are amazing too, thank you BHVR for this!
DEMOGORGON 2.0 YOU DO NOT DESERVE this license! Doesn't even look like Ripley, except the hair!
…and it bring me back into the game
Too bad we couldn't get the real Ripley
As a survivor i see this as a win and a " Im screwed " my dwight is so close to being sent to the void at this point he is gonna be there i see myself dying alot to alien
Yup.  This is definitely bringing me back to DBD. I just wish they made Ripley look more like Sigourney Weaver
I see a lot of Ripley mains coming.
YEEEEEEEESSS!!!
But was it programmed to harm the crew?
Ptb was pretty fun today. I wish the turrets would slow him down a bit, like 3% at least.
U should change the hooks with parts of the nest with eggs so they can get infected with facehuggers while laying on a wall (third stage their chests explode or something like that) a hook doesn't make sense with alien  Also u can afford Nicolas Cage but u can't add Sigourney Weaver into the game? That's pretty sad. Pay the actress her image rights so we can get the original Ripley plz 👉👈
Is that suppose to be Ripley? Cause looks nothing like Sigourney Weaver.
We also need Predator with plasma caster in dbd
Que bosta heim!
Ask and you shall receive
Sweet!!! I’m definitely playing it when it comes out
ну это вполне ожидаемо
Holy shit?! Y'all finally going to use something to block the killer that's not a wooden pallet?! Only taken 7 years to put something more fitting in its environment.                                         Edit: Oh my god, I was wrong! smh.
Still salty it wasn’t Jason
if only dead by daylight was actually good
omg I cant get over how amazing this is, so excited to play as a xenomorph for the first time in like 10 years since the avp game
No way they added the xenomorph from fortnite
They couldn't get Sigourney weaver's likeness? Why bother then. That really sucks but alien looks amazing
Dead by daylight creators definitely be listening to their fans all here for it❤️❤️
Doesn’t look much like Sigorney Weaver, but the Alien is the greatest monster of all time. RIP HR GIGER
YEEEEEES
I love the nice Alien 3 reference with the perspective shot at 1:21. You can clearly tell the developers at Behaviour fans are huge fans of Alien and I really appreciate that.
I hate the concept of Hellen Ripley just running from the xeno. Why? Because shes not like that Ellen would try to kill it.
this might bring me back
hell fucking yeah!! 😎
This is a win
Now put Verdugo in and I'll be happy
WOOOOO THIS COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!
You know, between Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Dead by Daylight, Ellen Ripley had the worst two months ever.
When is the alien coming to live server
Give us s standalone version like this and get millions
Dead by daylight team. Please stop making the good looking, I want to be scared not swooned.
Oh hell yes
один из самых лучших трейлеров которых я видел, молодцы разработчики, вы хорошо постарались!
*FINALLY!!!!* 🥺😢😭🥲
Can't possibly convey how flippin excited I am for this chapter!
Literally my childhood desires has come true. 🥲
Am I crazy, or does Ripley not look like Ripley?  That survivor doesnt look like Sigourney Weaver at all lol, is this due to the Strike going on?
Yesssss it's finally here!!!!!!!!
That cat better be ok!
please next time engineer killer too!! 🎉
Now add Predator to the game
This might actually get me to re install the game. I do wonder how there going to debuff the xenomorphs speed though.
I’m a huge fan of the Alien series, and I love this update.
I have been screaming for both Xenomorph AND Ripley since I first started playing 4 years ago. Ripley is now my new main. Now here's hoping for Predator next!!
W ❤
fix the game contains a lot of bugs, matchmaking of new players against veteran games.
I hope it runs on all 4 like in aliens vs predator 2010 game
I LOVE IT BUT IM A PREDATOR FAN! ADD PREDATOR
How funny would it be if this chapter released with Hawkins reskinned as an Alien map
its about dam time thank you
At last, my favorite horror movie joins the ranks.
This was worth watching again
Apenas 1 palavra: Perfeito.
What an awesome trailer !
GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER!!
That alien pov tho
The model looks awesome but the rest makes ZERO sense. Build up your power by jumping into a vent, instantly teleporting you into a spaceship where you traverse a spaceships corridors while tracking footsteps above you then jumping out only to be slightly stealthed and now with essentially a melee spear attack (your tail) that you can LOSE if you get blasted by a flame torret? WTF were you thinking!? NO facehuggers, NO alien through the chest mori, a pretty bland and uninteresting map with a couple of movie elements.. This is a HUGE letdown.. AGAIN! This chapter should have made me jump out of my chair with excitement  but once again I'm sitting here wondering... WHAT!?
This might just get me back onto dbd. Ill be an alien and demo main
I have not played in a while but time to change that
Me finished Aline the Dark Descent Now this? I'm having such a treat xD TQ for this new chapter
Hoestly, amazing work getting Alien into dbd!
When arrive the thing killer
Only one thing to say: H Y P E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E E ! ! ! ! ! ! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not a huge Sci-fi horror fan, but I know a lot of people wanted this so I am excited for them.  Will probably buy it just to keep my collection going - now to figure out why my Sadako keeps over correcting into trees (it's my fault, I'm just not sure how).
If the cat is not a a skin I am revolting.
It's game over man!!! 😱
Wtf no facehuger mechanic for alien?? Agg bullshit. Boicot.  Boeing killer
Ahhh! I’m so excited for this! Ash Williams, Laurie Strode, Nicholas Cage, and now this! Oh my god! I’m so pumped!🖤
one thing that needs to be done is rework the original killers(the ones from beforecall the famous ones were added) in the game or at least give them a polish,
I really hope Sigourney Weaver is voicing Ripley, that would be amazing haha
Why no Sigourney Weaver?
YAY
okay but was it designed to harm the crew?
To be fair I'm surprised this wasn't done sooner. Definitely happy to see More Sci-Fi stuff :3
How do they keep getting better ? This chapter seems amazing!!! Well done tip everyone I hope the killer is fun and scary
Janky Xenomorph Action
Now we need predators
I don't know who is responsible for IP  negotiation, but i hope he gets best bonuses. It is anazing how DBD gets all those rights
Amazing trailer
W
Super excited! I’m a big fan of both Alien and Aliens, can’t wait for this chapter!
Ay yo, I am so hyped, bru. What's next the Yauncha from Predators, bru? Bro, that would be sick to see and Arnold character next as a survivor  (⁠づ⁠｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡⁠)⁠づ
Game over man! Game over!
This trailer gave me Alien Isolation PTSD
scary
The worst looking Ellen Ripley in the history of gaming.
THAT’S MOTHER
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS I CANT BELIEVE ITS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
Why couldn't they have just called it the alien? xenomorph is the incorrectly adopted term to refer to the alien
Esperaba con tanto hype esto, casi como esperé el capitulo de Resident Evil <3
I have been waiting for this chapter for so long 😭❤
Can't wait for this. We eatin good this month.
❤
NO WAYYY
Yes
Can’t wait
No map?
I just got railed by the Xenomorph, face down arse up... never laughed so hard. What a video game.
Wheres fnaf crossover
I'm just hoping that someday soon we get a dead space pack. being able to play as Isaac Clarke would  be awesome he would have great eng-jocky perks
New main. Time to get 2000+ hours with one killer.
This trailer was fire 🔥🔥🔥
Waited 4 years for this. FINALLY
EVERYBODY wanted this
Если будет карта на косм корабле это будет очень круто,прям жду если добавят такое
Out of curiosity, are these crossovers canon?  I know that in terms of lore the survivors are all technically dead, which is why they ended up where the game takes place to begin with, but I'm having a hard time believing the crossover survivors (aside from Bill) are actually dead.
They always get what their fans want
In space no one can hear you spam click
pls give us a hicks legendary!!
This actually makes the most sense out any versions of the game,you would repair a gen while being hunter by the xeno
Where is SpringTrap? We want the man behind the slaughter
Ripley is a bit "eh." But the trailer was amazing!
I'm assuming the map is going to have a thousand pallets and with the new vault update, I'm guessing the killer is not going to be able to catch survivors.
Never seen an Alien movie before, it just looks like a giant humanoid bug🤨
Я кстати чужого смотрю по тв прямо сейчас🥰 Обожаю эту франшизу
At 1:41, it almost looks like the Xenomorph is smiling, as if it's saying "Found you..."
🐈
Xenomorph looks really amazing, but I’m kinda disappointed that the survivor character doesn’t look like Sigourney Weaver at all. As a huge fan of the movie Alien I wanted Ripley to become my main.
Dead space????🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
FINALLY
RIPLEYYYYYYYY❤❤❤
killer camper🤣
I’m hyped for this game again!
I just can't believe we actually got it
NOT cool. if ripley woke up in the realm of the Entity, than that means the entity took a kitty!
I still wish pin head could talk again
Next Predator please
Better re-install this
Fuck yes
LETS GOOOOOOO
Great trailer I have to say, that you are getting better and better at creating concepts and trailers every year, which is a good sign, keep it up.
I wish they make indonesian ghost for DBD character...would be awesome
Poor Dwight, in all the trailers Dwight has to suffer in unimaginable ways.
I hope my over 46.000 Liike button presses weren't in vain and the trailer doesn't promised too much! <3
ok ion like this game that much anymore but i might get this game back just to get this dlc, finally DBD takes a W
Assuming we do get a new map, it makes me wonder if there will be an option for survivors to activate stuff like the steam to have a chance to avaid the killer. I do think it's about time survivors have other options to get away than flashlights/flash bangs. Seems unlikely,  but it does make me wonder.
I want a killer darth vader
i want the cat as a walking entity through out the map like the alien spiders on dvarka or the rats in thompson house
Yeah, cool. Now do Terminator.
I mean, I guess it would help if Ripley looked like Ripley. 🤔 And at what point of the ALien timeline is this supposed to be set?
PUMPPEDDDDDD. ONE OF THE MOST BADASS FINAL GIRLS
such a good collab
So, ive heard this isnt actually Sigourny Weavers likeness, but it is her character. Much like Laurie, so what is Ripley based on?  A comic book I assume?
i love it but i do wish the xenomorph was a bit less beefy
Alma Wade when
now preddy next 😫
IF YOU DO NOT INCLUDE THAT SMOKE AS A PALLET I AM NOT GONNA BE HAPPY
Havent played the game in a while because the ps4 version of it always has bugs in it for god knows what reason but this just cool! Might get in again.
Its been so many years
The entity better be careful, messing around with the multiverse this much is how you end up in a cell at site 19
Can't quite tell from this but it looks like the map might have passive traps to use against the killer and if that is indeed the case that's a big misstep by bhvr.
Return  to Ellen Ripley  a ALIEN Game  🕹
The memories of playing Alien Isolation makes this feel so nostalgic. The hype is real
You change release dates to do dmg control all yall want. I'm still gonna play TCM 🍻
🤣🤣🤣 tell me that xenomorph didn't smile. I feel like it smiled at the end
Pls make a game mode specifically for this map and killer when it releases
CAT
Why do they always make the characters look completely wrong?
Wish we had 2 survivors like Kane so we could have make and female alternate character skins like we had in Resident Evil. Would have liked to have played as Bishop or David.
holy shit
I didn't think Alien would make for a good addition since they tend to kill everything, but now, I'm hoping one of the kill animations is the survivor that's being killed, gets Chestbursted.
It ain’t Friday the 13th so L
Don't know how I feel about alien throwing ppl on hooks, but why not I guess.. should've been Jason
Nah bro we need to do how Much better Dbd trailers are getting
Dead by Daylight might be the greatest horror game of all time. It's practically immortal and it's breathing new life into old franchises that the movies can't seem to do anymore. Major major props.
Wonder if they used Hawkins map for this one 🤔
Is this kiler suposed to replace the demogorgon?
But I would be happy to see Five Nights at Freddy's in dead by daylight
I wish there was like a thing where it changes the power to face hungers or something like freedy has two powers pallet or snare
I uninstalled a year ago
Everyone can already imagine the mori scene penetrate through survivor's chest
This is amazing
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Lost my desire to play the game So many campers and tunnelers So many a**h*le killers There should be a way to stop them Players should be able to report them then the game should look into it and ban them in the game for hours or make them lose bloodpoints. It is also not fair that so many killers can put you down in one hit. Especially the killers with chainsaw. They are so damn fast and can put you down with one hit, how is that fair?   If someone gets disconnected too. There should be a bot to replace that player. My apple tablet shut down many times while playing and I could not open it. I felt bad for my teammates. It was not fair. The game was just loading or just started and I haven't been injured or hooked yet but my tablet shut down. I wish there should be a bot to replace disconnected player so it would be fair for other players. I think you guys could make something work.   Please fix the search result too I don't know how many times me and my friends tried adding each other to play together but no results found. The game is great but so many things ruin the fun.   Hope you guys would fix these issues and do something for those camping killers or that ones who tunnels. They ruin the fun for everyone because they want easy game for themselves. Survivors lose their desire to play because of those weak killers.
Ok that is dope now they need predator
She is not Sigourney Weaver... I'm disappointed 😞😞😞
Oh yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
its not a terror killer! other demogorgon! va! very generic! 😴
Not even for you to pay the rights to Sigourney Weaver!!!/ Nem pra vocês pagarem os direitos da Sigourney Weaver!!!
no fucking way
*Alien: Isolation* - "Am I a joke to you?"
he would be blind?
This is freaking awesome 💯🔥🙌and Now do predator as the killer with Arnold as the survivor in a jungle map
you guys did a really nice job with this one
過去1カッコいい！！
Guys dont let yourself be fooled, you would think that this alien thing is the killer, but it is the Cat actually.
Wow. Just wow! No words! Sick trailer. Really good PTP. Well done Behaviour 🎉
Now all we gotta do is wait for springtrap (it prob won’t happen it’s a joke)
this might be the best killer out of the last 3 we had have to wait and see but from gameplay he doesn't camp very well so thank god lol
Ripley?..
Epic chapter ❤❤❤ it’s insane. I play ptb today map, surv and alien are fantastic 😍
ok, the best part about this is that they included the cat from the first movie
Why no map!?!?!?
Its game over man! (c)
I've been saying that they should do this for so long that I never actually thought they would do it
No fucking way
When we getting spring trap
Now if we could get The Predator & Arnold
I would not be surprised if the best mori is being introduced along with this
a new incredibly weak killer to bully with no fear :D
It is finally happening
Now I love RE but this might be the best trailer DBD has ever released if not tied with Nemmy
OMG es ist Hans-Rudi der leitende Ingenieur der USS-Ente 🤩
I loved DBD for a long time and I played it for years until a year ago, but this is something worth coming back for. Super Hype for this!!
finally something good happens... this game has been dead for a year imo
My God... Dead by Daylight is evolving...
add springtap
Finally my favorite franchise in my favorite game
Ripley actually made it into dbd
No fucking way did they do this
But i thought the Singularity filled this niche
хватит блокировать старые версии дбд zaebali
This is too cool
I hope Jonsey is in the map
LESSS GOOOO
❤❤❤❤
Well thats too bad. Its not Sigourney Weaver exactly. Its Ripley but in name and character only, or they just did not get her looks quite right, I can't tell since DBD often has issues getting their 3D models and art exact.
This is possibly one of the best DBD collaboration of all time!
Now this is epic
Alien fits this alot better than predator would, hope we get other monsters like maybe the big daddy from bioshock
No..oh no..
The best killer ever released so far.   - A 8000 hrs main killer
does anyone know when it comes on out console?
I want HOOOKED ON YOU DLC!!PLZ!!!
Next killer gotta be Predator right ? 😁
Im so happy they actually did this
I’m buying right away
bravo
This is literally the best crossover in any game... Ever
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🤤🤤
周年では無いタイミングでの久々のビッグタイトルとのコラボでワクワクしますね。  最近はずっとオリジナルキャラが続いて、玄人（大会勢とかいうやつ）好みのゲームになりつつあったけど ニコラスケイジ登場と固有の面白パーク等で、また観てても楽しいe-showに戻った感あったので、エイリアンコラボもそういった楽しさが生まれると良いな。
Is it to much to ask for a TV show like this?
Menos trece nos advirtió...
fucking amazing
Please bring the stranger things pack back for new players!
Great another massively op and broken killer. Just continues to make the game unfair and unfun for survivor players.
OMG
Damn, I’ll be a bit late to the party since I’ll be moving but exited for this release.
Sacrilege.
There are way better moments for a chase theme in this trailer (mostly 1:30) than in an actual chase theme which sux. Imagine 1:21 was layer 2, and 1:30 was layer 3, that would be amazing.
The reason why i will come back to DbD
There’s no way the Nostromo map has unique interactions with doors and gas pipes… right?
If it can at all capture the total shit your pants fest that alien isolation is then major w and being a huge alien and predator nerd I'm all about this, having the limited release alien anthology hard case edition and origin predator steal case edition amoung the other non crap Walmart editions of the films this is excellent, I remember saying a year a ago if they added alien and actually tweaked and worked its abilities and how it got around and percs it should be amazing and it looks as though though they have achieved this in spades and I am so excited buying this as soon as it's available on PlayStation not a second later, and i may have to trade in bing a myers main for many years
What did they go to her face??? 😢😢 Edit: No one give me shit on this. If they can give us accurate Nicholas Cage, Ash, Nancy, Steve, etc. Why not give us the beautiful Sigourney Weaver. They gave us wish Ripley. 😢
Im so excited for this. This is going to be super hyped 😮
This one is definitely programmed to harm the crew
Awesome. Predator nextt
absurdo, apenas, absurdo
Long time alien fan and just now getting into this gem of a game and they go and treat me with this! Like it was meant to be!
Man. Please no 3 Gen killers. I love Alien.
Finally
Dissappointed and my day is ruined. I played the PTB everything Alien have only tail attack and its cringe u can't disable it if its activates u forced to play with it, no facehuggers, no toxic spits, no speed asf movement, only fucking tail... u forced to play with, and survivors have 7x2 Flame turrets whats the point if they can just spam whole map with it so u will not use ur ability, looks like not like Alien looks like degradatedAlien
This is why dbd will always be the best game to exist
I wonder how the entity convinced alien to join 😂
I've always been too afraid of those aliens, even though I know they don't even exist 😂. Now it will be more terrifying to play 💀💀.
Watching a xeno smiling is probably the most terrifying thing I’ve seen recently
She left poor Dwight on the hook LMAO
Could have done more with Xenomorphs powers. He is very unique with lots of abilities. Shame he is basically a nemesis re skin. Bit disappointed, but glad he is in the game.
you guys nailed it, it looks awesome i cant wait!!
This trailer is amazing! I have seen some of the game play and this looks like an amazing chapter. Mad props to Behavior for getting this license and executing it masterfully!!
I want to play this survivor!
Ladies and gentlement, this, is isn't a dream anymore Alien chapter is really here, in Dead By Daylight
Please tell me I can play as Jonesy
Finally...
I have never been this excited for a new killer announcement
And this is why DBD is and will always be the king of the horror game genre 🔥🔥🔥
Enfin !!!!
The mori should be a facehugger and a chest burster
Wish this space ship map was coming to the game.
Now this is exciting, I love some classic horror and thriller movies. This has me hyped like I wanna see more and can't wait for the dlc to be released.  My total DBD hours played on Steam so far are: 402.4
But is Weaver voicing her?
great job dbd team great fucking job! 🔥
Poor Dwight. Always screwed over.
-SCREEAAAAAAAM- OH MY GOD YESSSSSSS
not a fan of ripley but man alien is so lit
Why in these trailers killers always win 😂
Panties skin for Ripley!!!
Idk why this survivor looks so much like Nancy to me. 😂
Damn, I know its Xeno but now I want the Predators as a killer, it be so badass
wheres cat game
@buff deadhard then I’ll play the game again
OOOH ALIEN EPIC IDEA!!
*Can we play with the cat, plase?*
People compare him to the Demogorgan, but demo isn’t purchasable anymore so this guys like the better, cooler replacement
Need the predator next 👀
Finally some scary shit, not dude in pajamas.
I'm shocked every time a new killer comes out. I can't wait!
So where is cat?
1:12 this is so freakin cool that this is on the map too and it's working
cool a new character in the game in the game it would be great if this john kramer and billy from jigsaw 1:38 ❤
It wasn't programmed to harm the crew. It was supposed to help us build a safer home. But... something happened. It became self-aware. It has no empathy. It doesn't feel pain. It learns at an impossible rate, and it won't stop until we are dead... or worse.
THIS ISNT RIPLEY 🗣🗣🔥🔥‼️‼️
The Alien is finally here 👑. But they need to use the chase music in this trailer rather than the one in the ptb. This one is soooo much better
I feel like this is gonna be a 2.0 demogorgon tbh
This chapter looks stunning!
What about doing a bendy crossover?
As a huge Xenomorph fan with this game I am very happy 😃 😊💛
Бля, выглядит охуенно! Только не хватает аутентичной музыки
I like it
Depois dessa. Quero ver o Predador também! ❤
Love it. Alien was THE killer I wanted
*Bishop Legendary Skin*
FINALLYYYYYYYY
What about FNAF  ???
Oh I thought it was going to be a new killer, I think we're just getting a demogorgan skin which is pretty boring honestly
It is not Sigourney Weaver.  Pay tribute to the actress. The heroine is not like her.
I like how this looks, but why doesn’t Ripley look like herself?
LETS GOOOO! THIS IS SO EXCITING !
very cool, but that is NOT sigourney weaver lmao who is that
When a Game studio makes a better movie than a film crew
Release on mobile pls 😢
HR Giger xenomorph nest please
I am starting to think that if they add licensed characters they should only add the monsters. The licensed survivors never actually feel like the characters. You have the S.T.A.R.S members in the game that have fought monsters creepier and bigger than the ones in DBD yet they are too dumb to make a weapon out of a tree and run away from even normal teenagers that have knives. Now ripley. It would be like adding the Predator to the game alongside Dutch but having Dutch too dumb to do the simple things he did in the movies to fight back against the predator. Like forgetting how to use mud on your body thus making the predator blind when most of the DBD maps have mud everywhere. There originally was no such thing as "the entity" in DBD I think that whole concept came to be a thing in order to explain why so many people are too dumb to forge a spear from any of the many trees or forget how to rip off a piece of metal from all the junkyards or why characters known for killing BoW's the size of skyscrapers somehow forget all their training.   Sorry for the rant. I just find it to get more absurd the more I think about it.
Is the killer going to be blind
I hope that the Xenomorph plays like Alien: Isolation.
GAME OVER MAN!  GAME OVER!
New pallet system with the hot air at 1:14 perhaps??? Instead of a pallet it’d be hot air that stays for 2-3 seconds and the killer gets a short stun if they walk through but it doesn’t stay like a pallet where they have to break it and it’d be on like a 2 minute cooldown so it can’t be spammed
I Hope To See (Ghost Rider ) As Killer
This time it actually was programmed to harm the crew
now predator will be next lets hope
HOLY SHIT BEHAVIOR.
Smart move they know Texas chainsaw massacre is coming out and they drop this😂 they don’t want their players stolen
😂😂😂❤ I love it!!! I cant stop smiling because this is one of the chapters I have been hoping for most! Welcome Ellen and Xenomorph to the Fog, cant wait to play as, and against ya both.
NEED
omg omg omg omg Ripley omg omg omg omg
No hate on this section I will say some words:   I don’t get why people bully those who say “We want FNAF” like I wanted too but don’t you think it’s a little stupid for those who bully those like some wanted Pinhead bam we got it but suddenly they went the hate on behavior because of the NFT but that was resolved already no NFT involve in Steam and DBD however they are still hating for something silly because Springtrap in the words of the hater they say he don’t belong because FNAF is ahem a kids game because it’s not but that
Kill it with fire!
*THIS WAS THE COOLEST TRAILER I'VE EVER SEEN!!*
YES! Now if the devs could just make the actual gameplay as exciting and visually impressive as this trailer.
Nothing makes me happier. This is an absolute dub for DBD after the failed skull merchant. This will be one of the best licensed killers, and the first that I'll buy immediately once I get Alien I'm getting Nicholas cage
Please do The Thing next. If they can make the Spy from TF2 able to emulate other players complete with cosmetics im sure yall can too
NEW PALLET CONFIRMED
Give us this Map!!!
HE IS FINALLY HERE!!!!!! What a coincidence... I have been watching all Alien sequels just for curiosity and fun and now THE TEASER DROPS OUT OF NOWHERE AND NOW THE TRAILER! I'm loving this!
If they made a collab with alien, then I believe it'll only be a matter of time until predator is in the game. Maybe even make an AvP collab after predator is added.
She doesnt look like ellen lol
shame that just like laurie strode the character looks nothing like the actress but wicked nonetheless
She dead.
If the cats not a playable character then it’s a bad collab sorry 🥱
Damn August 29th? So long of a wait.
I dead ass think in the nearly 4 years I’ve been playing this game, I’m the most excited for these characters
But will this be temporary, just like the Stranger Things and the Demogorgon?
Just in time before Halloween
it´s wesking time
nice
If they don’t do anything with the face hugger I’m gonna be disappointed
They give us a skull merchant as a Wish version of Predator and make up for it with an actual alien license 😊
Man i cant wait to play the ptb surely my first game wont be 3 a three gen skull merchant.
I hope Ripley gets new skins so we can play as her friends and her daughter Amanda!!! ❤
Me encantó ❣️
YOU CAN PET THE CAT IN THE LOBBY???? 10/10
Alien killer is mid. perks are ass. TCM here we come
nada de ovo. nada de ovo? NADA DE OVO???
When fnaf??
Well, considering how useless the killers are atm, here we have the new guy we will be juking over and over.
I’m literally crying🥲
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Omg Ellen Ripley ❤❤❤❤❤❤
obrigada por tudo
is it just me, or does the face NOT look like sigourney Weaver?
wonder if the alien will reuse some of demogorgon's moves
So many games becoming ip dumps.
Ahhh shit here we go again
This is probably the best one yet
Man I miss AvP.
Wamen 😛
That means we’re definitely getting a predator killer next! Let’s go!
Whoo hoo this is an absolute win of a chapter, Alien & Ellen!! I'm definitely getting this Chapter and I can't wait to play, huge fan of the series!!❤
Have been hoping this moment would arrive for some time, as it was one of my biggest wants for the game. This is huge! Cannot wait, and well done, team! Plus releases on my birthday, no less! ❤️
Good moment to remember Alien Isolation. Incredible game!
Yes Frieza third form finally on DBD
The trailer sucks
This is so exciting. I can’t help but think, is Predator next? Love watching Ohmwrecker play this game. Thank you 😮👍🏽👏🏽
Bruhh
YIPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Dwight sempre tomando no cu, a propósito, belo trailer
Okay, so we got the xenomorph leather face. Freddy Krueger, what's next, Chucky chuckie or Spring trap or william afton
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
WHOOOOOO I’m fucking hyped for this shit! Looks awesome
항상 매튜야 이게 게임이냐를 외쳤었지만.. 이번에는 매튜야 이게 게임이다! 를 외쳐봅니다ㅠㅠ 미쳤다ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Can all of us show appriacate to devs for all of these crossovers. Look how many brand they got. holy shit. i couldnt even imagine that so many brands, characters, universes in the same game. one game with almost every horror icons. Huge RESPECT!
We need a Predator & Arny one as well as a T-800 Terminator & Sarah Connor DLC
I'm *disappointed* . How is she on a planet without a spacesuit ? Why doesn't the xenomorph have a canonical body structure ? Why is the map not a canonical Sulaco or Nostromo at all, but some kind of broken fragments?
Finally. I shall be accurate to my name
OMG I LOVE IT
This is fantastic! Oh I’m so excited to play as them! Also the map they come with looks incredible. Absolute win all around.
love it :)
guess it's time get back into the game again
no facehuggers? and why does Ripley not look like a Ripley at all? I was kinda excited but now Im a bit sceptical, will see ingame tho :)
Let's fucking go
Looks great I just Hope it won't bé a demogorgon remake
dead by daylight is boring now, game been out since 2016 and we are tired of constant patches and bugs, and we are tired of running away from a killer playing Tag, the concept is old, we need something completely brand new......DBD is boring nowadays
The Chase Music in Trailer is so Much Better... In the game is repetitive and annoying... Since Ghostface the quality of chase themes are decaying.
Yup it’s official I’m start playing dbd again
Arghhhhh, you better do respect to that Alien. Your looking at a creature that is supposed to be fast and agile, with a long and dangerous tail, all while being quite capable of detecting people from afar using sound. What's more, these things can canonically move on all fours and on two legs. Better be careful how you animate and present it, or else its gonna look like another clown that wobbles around chasing people in circles around crates and being staggered by a few wood planks.
I really hope they add some Marines like corporal hicks, private Hudson, private Vasquez. 🔥❤️
My bf think I'm crazy, but that's Hicks yelling "GO!" Just before she finds Dwight, right?
Screaming, crying, throwing up
It will be released on my birthday!
this is so epic
Picture this. Dead By Daylight: Jurassic Park.   Playable Characters: Alan Grant, Ian Malcolm, Ellie Sattler, Robert Muldoon.  The Killer: Velociraptor
Finally a killer I will buy. Good job.
About time 😊
I love inclusion of Jonesy the cat for this trailer! Maybe Jonesy is on the new map?
Hi
Is a steam trap a new version of a pallet?
YES! FINALLY!
Lo único que mantiene vivo a este juego son los licenciados.
Not how a Xenomorph would behave but I get the point of the game. Nevertheless, great trailer.
It wasnt programmed to harm the crew
Community is so toxic and I’ll give it a few days.. they’ll shit on both the killers and survivor perks.. talk shit about the devs, complaints here and there. The cycle goes on
We need five nights at Freddy's please 👀🔥
So there prolly won't be the Predator as playable Character... unlucky me...
W
I hope the survivor has anti-tunnel or this is an L licence
“It WAS programmed to hurt the crew”
i have never been more excited for a crossover
best killer good
And we still don't have springtrap.
IM SCREAMINGGGGGG
And were it?
Bro already trying my best to not get spoiled by any PTBs
Last time I was this hyped, was for the halloween trailer, AND NOW WE HAVE ALIEN! LEZ GO!
Please let this map be inside a space station and not an open field littered with random garbage...
god DAMN this has to be one of their best trailers so far they really went all out on this one.
OMG RIPLEY
Dead by Daylight makes me depressed af. Im 800 hours and killer is not fun. I wish we had other stuff to do instead of getting pissed or chasing. Survivor can relax eat chips,do gens,cleanse totems,boon totems,give chase to distract killer,unhook,heal, sabotage,etc yet killer can only damage,chase and attack
Now all we need is a NC alien and aliens isolation PS5 unreal engine and and alien isolation 2 PS5 VERSIONS Cough cough I love this epic music I love this whole trailer even at the end I do wish this was in 4K tho
The trailer casually showing off New environmental defenses besides pallets
They did really good ! I can't wait !
The trailer is good but the game is not.
Now all we need is the Predator and then the game will be perfect in my book! Speaking of which, it would also be nice to have alternate outfits from each of the Predator movies! That would be super awesome! Keep up the great work guys!
Excited, but also...what happened to the cat? 🥲
the animators NEED to get a raise for this one
I love the way Ripley reacted to the alien in this, no horror or screaming but immediate action and reaction, this is not her first rodeo and she knows what she’s doing, always good to see more veteran survivors added to dbd
i am so hyped omllll
Absolute fantastic addition
New map? Alien can tunnel?
Remember when they said they weren’t going to add anymore monsters that were non humanoid, seems we were duped!! Great job though
noice
Wow
Will we get a blind killer now!?  Having ultra sensitive senses able to detect players from accross the map while survivors can blend in with environment when not moving to avoid detection is really cool!
Pet the cat game option? Please.
PLEASE ADD STRANGER THINGS BACK!
待ってました！！ もう賛辞しか出て来ない！！ 実装するのを待ってます！！  I've been waiting! ! I have nothing but compliments! ! I can't wait to implement it! !
I HAVE SHIVERS
"They mostly come at night.... mostly" 😂 look forward to going up against the alien.
See y'all in the fog!
Bring the predator now
Pretty far stretch but maybe one of these days we could see John Carpenters the thing in this game
Anybody know if Sigourney Weaver's voicing her?
I’m honestly surprised this didn’t happen sooner! This will be great!
A cat
This is gonna be awesome! They better do Ripley right and give her some good perks!
The survivor does not look like Ripley at all not good. She looks like just some random characters you guys made up
They finally got what I wanted I always said to my self “what if alien is in dbd?” Here it is…. The masterpiece we all wanted
Show me the spotlight on it please I love this fear and terror of all this
Big chap looks so good, I love the model
Finally
Man this came out pretty early
Generic Ripley is pretty whack.
Cant wait for everyone to relive the same thing every chapter does build hype let hype die realise the game is the same as always gens and kills and the devs are out of touch af with the community and cant balance for crap
Now we just need the predator
The Twins Fusion with The Demogorgon = Alien
Damn I quit dbd a year ago. This might just pull me right back in.
Dutch and Predator next 😂 this looks absolutely incredible
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😁😁😁😁😁😁😁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Thats what I call EZ money
This is everything
best chapter so far and the best trailer
with the MAP !
Absolute W, gj Dbd team
Man, if you are gonna do Ripley, it has to be Sigourney Weaver. Otherwise do like the Daughter from Alien: Isolation or somethin.
Much better then a fnaf one
Upcycled demogorgon?
i cannot tell you how loud i screamed when i saw ripley's face
did art school students make this cinematic?
The animation of this trailer is epic! I’m so excited for this
W.
Ellen Ripley waking up to some new bullshit for the 13th time - 😐
I'll be completely honest, I thought I was done with this game, but as a lifelong xenomorph and Ripley fan I must have this.
The trailers and cut scenes always look good , I'll make my determination once I see the actual gameplay.
now waiting for predator dlc
Devs: This looks great. Let’s just nerf Pig and we’re set to launch
great trailer. Interesting ability, but wasted by an overpowering flamethrower. and too narrow ability judgment. Can be easily blocked by obstacles, but cannot hit survivors blocking you in front of you.
RIPLEYYYYYYY
엘렌 리플리!!!도랏!!!!!!
Thats amazing!
Now we need predator and my life will be complete
But isn't there already Alien: Isolation?
Dont forget springtrap and jason
This trailer deserves more views
Wow holy shit alien on dbd
Cannot wait to catch bodies with this character Thank You so much BHVR
Music at the end sounds terryfing. Love it!
I'm excited, for TCM
"Guys its Black!! Black vented!!"
Where is fredi fasber ou ou ou ou ou😂
If thiss trailler is what the gameplay will look like and it wont be buged to hell it can be big refresh for killers in dbd.
Man I was hoping for a Sigory Weaver likeness.
I wonder if the facehuggers will be apart of alien, that was the scariest thing about alien to me
Wow I might actually re download the game a play for a little before the suffering catches up to me again and I delete it till the next licensed killer comes out.
Always waiting for Springtrap as a killer.
YES!!!
Wow, you guys really know how to make us happy
Now time for the hunter to show up to and show this beast how a real predator acts!
cool we need Predator)
FNAF fans:👁️👄👁️
FUCK YEAH! ELLEN RIPLEY KICKING XENOMORPH ASS! 🤘🤘🤘
Still feels unreal that we're finally getting this. Always felt like one of those "pie in the sky" sort of dreams. But I'm so happy.  Dead By Daylight truly is a love letter to all things horror.
Ooh that’s released around the time I finish my course, ya girls gonna treat herself 😍😍
Super excited for this chapter❤
Can't wait for this ! Lorewise, the fact that she crashed on LV-426 with the Narcissus and the nostromo and is able to breath normally before the Atmospheric processor was even built tickles me, does it imply that the Entity replicated Both the nostromo and LV-426, hijacking the Narcissus in the process ? Can't wait to play this anyway !
Dead by Daylight...A game that never cuts corners and keeps on giving. Not many developers like BHVR
If the trailer is hinting at what the power will be it seems to be either some type of sprint similar to Feral Frenzy or something to do with vents.
Can killer Sonic exe?
I love how she noticed she couldnt talk
This doubled my faith in dead by daylights relevancy and gave it to Nicolas cage 😊🥰😊
YESSSS
ridiculos, tão desesperados só pq o the texas chain saw ta vindo aí
Why did you post the demogorgon trailer again?
I am so freakin stoked. Thank you to the whole DBD team for making this happen. 🤘🏻
Doesn’t look like that in game 🤷🏻‍♂️ & Why isn’t it the actual actress?
Super excited! Wished we were getting a new map!
Haven't been this excited for a Xenomorph making a guest appearance since its playable appearance in Mortal Kombat X. 👽
I’m so excited for this can’t wait 🔥🔥
We have Sigourney Weaver at home
Did anyone hear the sonic 06 iblis birds screech or was it only me
I only watched the trailers for the game so far but damn, this really makes me want to buy the game. What's next? Predator? Jason Voorhees?
Everything is great but... Do you really need to tell whole story in a trailer? Montage is too fast, too many scenes destroy the atmosphere
Took long enough to get this franchise into this game.
No offence to Alien fans but I would still rather a Friday the 13th chapter
Oh my God it's happening, nobody panic.
Walmart Brand Ripley right here.
Wondering if they’ll ever do a Friday the 13th collab
Man I just keep getting my killer predictions correctly! Alright heres another predictions you guys. Dbd devs oh bring us: -John Constantine played as Keanu Reeves from Constantine  -Issac Clake from Dead Space -The 2 brothers from Supernatural  -Oh and the exorcist -DINO CRISIS
Bueno, toca volver al dbd
Im not even playing DBD, but this expansion looks friggin awesome.  And seems like a LV-426 map could be included.
Yes!! They're putting Ellen Ripley in the DLC as I had hoped! You can't do Alien without Sigourney Weaver's character! 💀🎮
Is Ellen Ripley tall? If I remember Sigourney Reaver is pretty tall. 5 ft 11 or 6 ft I think.
Now we just need the predator dlc
Awesome trailer.
Finally!
This was really unexpected for me, first the legendary Nicolas Cage and now Alien? This is mad crazy ❤
Вот и дождались второй Изоляции.
This trailer was very good. Not gonna lie, I laughed a bit hearing that silly Dwight
If xeno dont get a skin based off of the Mutant Brute from the Aliens Fireteam Elite pathogen DLC, I am going to be seriously disappointed. *Take my money, damnit!*
I've been waiting since 2018 for jason voorhes I came to the dbd, will he come this year?..
i’m… terrified
*Art The Clown when?*
I never played this game but this gives me a good reason to now
alright my man if we got Alien we definitely need to see the Thing.
God the Xenomorph is gorgeous om this
Bro my childhood dream come true, also predator next maybe hm? Mayhaps?Nah fr tho really excited about this one, and my wallet is drooling
Wow, this is so good.
when predator
I'm sure they didn't but I'm pretty sure if they'd ask Sigourney she'd have done the screaming lmao
Looks pretty sick
In the fog no one can hear your scream
Yes finally i hope we get a amanda Skin
WE WANT CARRIE!!!!
- Mother, I've finished repairing all the 5 gens! *The ship will self destruct in T minus one minute* - YOU B*TCH!!
Now it's Fnaf's turn
Finally a normal survivor. Nice chapter
K now do predator 😂
hyped
Still waiting for a Jason at Dead by Daylight club..
So if the Xeno is here......Then Predator will appear.
New Killer: The Cat
Dear @behaviour please add Amanda Ripley too. I will now be playing no other characters. Thanks. :3
this is SICK
Doesn't look anything like Ripley lol.. Who the fuck drew and animated this garbage .
Yesssssssss
AMAZING. Massive props to the animation team, the quality here is insane!! Chills throughout - and man, I can't wait to main Ripley. I've looked up to her since I was a little girl.
Now we need just Predator!! 😂😂
I can not wait to get hooked by this thing!
No bloody way. Pinhead, Nic Cage, now alien
Okay this might be one of the coolest movie crossovers for a game
They're better be Facehuggers in some iteration
BUYING THIS ASAP I NEED YO PLAY AS RIPLEY!!!
Shut up and take my money!
Yess!
Dwight, thank you for your hard work.
🎉🎉🎉  Now we need , the nun , Jason , ET & chucky 😊
what about Carrie??? have a high school gym as a prom night setting
This chapter will probably become and my fav especially since the survivor ACTUALLY reminds u of the actual actor !!🖤🖤🖤
bro this is so epic just wanna know this is coming out tomorrow right?
Dont tell me this is gonna be Demogorgon 2.0 as its power, man if thats the case then I might actually just delete the game as that will be so shite
I AM SO HYPED!!!
Yo dbd devs, if your reading this I would just like to say thank you 🥹🥹
She looks nothing like the original character
watched all 4 alien movies recently, and am hyped.
Looks good, except Ripley doesn't look like Ripley..  just my opinion..
i wanted the amanda ripley from the game not ellen ripley from the movie but i guess it works this too. Amanda ripley looks better than ellen ripley
Ok hear me out, what if the somehow added the Velociraptor from Jurassic Park as a killer and have Alan Grant or Ian Malcolm as the survivor
Why is a orange cat in trailer? 😂😂
So crazy and unbelievable! So is that Sigourney Weaver? Is that Ripley?
i love this game!!! still suspenseful
the longest animated trailer is like a fragment of a movie
We don’t care we want Jason and stranger things
Please Chucky 🙏🏻
Thank you DbD ❤
OMG
I'm excited! A few months ago I've finished playing Alien, while playing I've always thought this killer would be amazing in dbd, can't believe its actually getting a chapter
First robot alien and now real deal on a movie!!
Sponsor Viva La Dirt League to do a promotion of this. I demand it.
Why the basement of the killer is common and  look's like on other maps, you could stylize like  the alien's hollow
Did you guys hire Sigourney for the voice acting?
Great update as always. Killer suggestion: Anton Chigurh Source: No Country for Old Men Alternate skin: Judge Glanton (Blood Meridian)  Weapon: Restrained bolt Ability: Uncomfortable presence. Anton has a way of making people unnerved, just by looking at him. Anton can activate this ability while within sight of the other players. Doing so slows him down to a regular player's speed but as long as he's visible, skill checks WILL FAIL. This ability is metered and has a cooldown period that refills only when it is empty. While active, the terror radius will have an unpleasant drone that will signal to players that death awaits around every posssible corner.  Perks focusing on creating division between players No good deed: Healing another player causes them to be revealed. Keeping your word: Performing a mori causes the last player who had a co-op action with the victim to be wounded and revealed. Padded footsteps: Transfer your terror radius to the least damaged target provided that all others have been wounded once, confusing the players.  Items:  Bloody handcuffs: Ambushing a player while using padded footsteps allows the player to activate a QTE. Successfully doing so results in instantly downing the victim. Other victims can try breaking the hold using flashlights and firecrackers  and the victim can break free using pallets if reachable.  Special quarter. Activating any of the perks above builds up a token up to 6 levels. The item can be called once a survivor is downed with a 50-50 chance of right call. A success can inflict a deep wound on the nearest active player whereas a failure revives the downed player. Each level adds an additional 5% chance of succeess for a maximum of 75%. A single call consumes all levels, so it's always an act of opportunity management. Memento Mori: Anton blasts out the knees of a player with his silenced shotgun as they crawl away, he finishes them with the restraining bolt to the head.
We have been waiting for this moment for so long...😢   It's finally here.
Oh sh*t this is gonna be good
👀
I haven’t been unable to retain my excitement in such a long time, I can’t WAIT FOR THIS ON CONSOLE
Recamper el killer XD
Wish it was the real Ellen, but still pretty cool.
You Opened Up The Box , I  C A M E
Next is predator, with a nice medium- large map? Yes please
HELL YEAH!!!!
Is ti just me or Ripley looks like Nancy Wheeler?
hawkins labb 2.0? vibes
You did it, you crazy son of a bitch you did it….
YES YES YES YES MY FAV GAME AMD MOVIE OF ALL 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 BEEN WAITING FOR AGES FOR THIS
This Chapter is fire af!!!
Yo this is awesome
It’s game over man, it’s game over!
All that's left now is the Predator
They mostly come at night……..mostly
Everything looks really fantastic as far as models go, but god damn that looks nothing like Sigourney Weaver lmao
Guess they couldn't Sigourney Weaver's likeness and maybe even voice?
seems fire
I’m so excited for this chapter 🤩
We definitely need a post-apocalyptic chapter in the next year like “I Am Legend”. Alien is so cool and Ripley too, by the way.
Alien Isolation Part 2
Ripley at home
Yes
Sad they couldn't get Sigourney Weaver to voice act for Ellen. Even sadder they couldn't get the rights to her likeness.
Ooooh yeah it's time
I was hyped for Cage because it's him, but this...this is another level of hype. The damn Xeno and Ellen "Most Badass Last Girl" Ripley. Game over, man! GAME OVER!
I can't wait to play Jonesy the cat in dead by daylight, best alien character!!!!!
If the MF is teleporting over the map like the Dredge, I'm uninstalling. I love Alien but I'm so DONE with teleporting killers
Please let me pet the cat in game
Reminds me of my driends house
This NEEDS to be a Permanent installment to the game, or at least appear during Halloween as a seasonal collaboration event because that would be straight up awesome sauce. Have fun everyone being chased by the scariest fluffing thing in Sci-fi existence.
FUuCK YEAH
My inner child would be horrified of this, any alien related thing always scared me, but seeing this is super exciting cant wait to play!!
Xenomorphs are perfect for this game... i really hope they get this right cuz I love the Alien franchise!!!
bro we just want spring trap
PLEASE tell me, that the Cat will be a part of the game!!!❤
This makes me want alien isolation 2😢
We're getting closer ladies and gentlefish. One step closer... to The Thing...
I hoped to the last that Jonesy would be one of the survivors. What a shame. And now seriously - I hope that you will make a skin for Amanda Ripley.
Mission accomplished, good work
W behaviour moment
Listen I was the guy spent half an hour hiding under the table as Ridley daughter crapping myself in fear playing alien isolation when we got level alien nest and I saw face huggers crawling in water I was like nope I'm not moving this point what make you think I'll play this
This looks so good!
AMAZING!!!! ❤
What the hell did they do to Ripley looks nothing like the character hard pass on this
OMG THIS LOOKS AMAZING
From the looks of the trailer it seems the alien is gonna play just like demo. A m1 slash attack and a pounce. I really hope this isn't the case.
Dead By Daylight pls introduce predator !
This is amazing
Remenber Alien Player Character Fighter DLC in Mortal Kombat XL Kombat Pack and Fortnite Player skin Item Shop now Dead by Daylight wa you Favorite Alien Mortal Kombat XL NetherRealm  Studios Fortnite Epic Games and Dead By Daylight Starbreeze Studios da Evolución Alien Videogames inpirent Movie Culture Pop👍
Not a great likeness of Weaver and I'd have preferred the ridge-headed Alien design (perhaps a cosmetic option), but here's hoping for facehugger/cocooning mechanics and more.
I cant wait to see Alien adapted into another video game. Its not like there's, well over, 30 Alien video games. Xenomorph in Fortnite. Xenimorph in Mortal Kombat. What a unique and totally original idea............
One of the greatest survivors ever meets the perfect assassin killing organism... Now we just need the greatest hunter in the galaxy...
LMFAO BHVR COULDNT GET THE RIGHTS TO USE SIGOURNEY’S LIKENESS...
Welcome foolish mortals to the planetoid LV-426!! LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!!
I got goosebumbs! Rally good Trailer
Haven't felt like this since silent hill drop
How did this just come up out of no where it’s already official
Alien isolation all over again hell yes
This might bring me back
by far the best chapter
Is that Sigourney Weaver doing Ripley's voice? Even if not, that's a good soundalike from the trailer. Honestly it all looks great, can't wait to see how it all plays!
Yes thank you dbd me and dad will be hella pros with alien and ellen
Bro camped the hook...
Can the next killer be springtrap From fnaf
Bro why does Dwight die in every trailer 💀
If the next killer is the depredator this game is the goat
Looks so good
This is awesome DBD!
Good, now add Jason.
why is the killer proxy camping the Dwight bruhhhhh
THE GOATED HAVE ARRIVED!!!
這異形被限制的真慘，照理說該秒殺的獵物也要照規矩抓去掛
finally, thanks Behavior for fulfilling our wishes
Dwayne hicks legendary skin, please!!!
Looks super cool ! It seems like survivors will have a new way to stun killers on this map as well which would be a nice detail.
10000% the best trailer in dbd history fucking brilliant
sick, I haven't gamed much on the pc game even tho I have it downloaded but i might have to. I lost interest in mobile when BHVR gave control to Netease but i might have to jump in to check out Xenomorph now.
Hoping its not just a reskinned demogorgon.  Badass though!
I waited so long for this❤
Wow they did it
Can't wait to see doom slayer be the next killer
THANK YOU BHVR !!!!!!
thank you for your efforts, you are gold in the gaming world.
This is trully W
And now I want survivors to be able to open steam vents to block the killer. 🙂
So The Entity once again traveled through the vast holes of hell to find the soul of a certain malevolent extraterrestrial being who swore revenge against the human who wiped it from the face of the universe!!! So it brought it back and it's survivor (but it didn't came back alone) to restart the nightmare all over again!!!
Huge W
Love this trailer. My only disappointment is that they didn't go full Alien lore with this addition.  Instead of putting the survivors on the hook, the Alien should put them in the hive resin, pasting them to a wall or post. And instead of trying to hold of the Entity, it could be a facehugger trying to force its way onto the survivor. When the survivor fails, the Alien Queen would pull them into the blackness.  All that said, I'm excited to see this in action!
Где русский язык на консолях?
Teh model looks a little strange around the head, but HOLY SHIT I knew this would happen someday. I'm so stoked. The vibes are immaculate. I love y'all.
Трейлер збс игра по прежнему дерьмо сырое
Werewolf Dead By daylight
Now they only need the tall man from phantasm that would be awesome 😎
Jonesy! 😄
predator next ?
W updates from dbd team they just making straight peakkk
Music here should've been the chase music goddamn
Wow dreams do come through 😭😭alien and ripley what a time to be alive.
It’s funny how the Xenomorph just waltzed up next to Ellen.  It’s as if it were saying, “Oh look at that guy hanging on the hook. Anyways…”
new game mechanic smoke screen
No map?
GYAAT
….
I'm ready for it
Ptb?
Dead game.
SHIT The trailer is fucking good!  Want to say I'm vary happy how you been adding ganeplay elements into trailers it not only can tell New players what your doing but it gives the trailers a sense of bei g grounded in its world that you have created
Oh shit
I love you guys
대박🎉
The panel she used to block the door was so heavy that only a woman could lift it.
This Is Definitely a Solid 10/10  Now all we need is Predator "especially since his game hasnt really gotten new content in awhile and the most recent dlc happened to be a Predator Hunting Party Pack 3"  I Could See Predator fitting well in this game as well.  and being a Big Sci FI Horror fan  I Definitely am going to enjoy the ALIEN DLC for DbD
I was here!
Five nights at Freddy's next plz
im crying ❤
They be making whole movies at this rate
Screaming, crying, throwing up, etc.
So, based off the trailer, as a survivor in chase you’ll have to trigger the tanks to slow alien down and one of aliens powers will be that he can travel through vents, but don’t know how they’ll implement it on maps that don’t have any.
LET'S FUCKING GO BOYS! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO!
She kinda look like nancy. It gives hawkins vibes
Winning 🏆
I'm extremely new to Dead by Daylight myself. Now, I've been watching content on it for about 3 years, but haven't played it myself until very recently. I have maybe...3 hours of gameplay. This has me super hyped and excited. Now, I don't think I personally have enough time put into this game where anything I say is useful at all, but this is awesome.
if the alien doesnt have the facehugger as an ability then thats a loss.
MY GIRL RIPLEY IS PLAYABLE LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is awesome!
Now all we need is Predator and the Terminator!
THE CAT
I hope we get terminator too, and the thing
Take my money now
Alien is such an amazing series, everyone knows it's good, everyone knows why it's good -- to the point that Alien Isolation, a labor of love from people who genuinely cared for the series, managed to feel like an authentic midquel set between the first two films.  Yet somehow, despite decades of people knowing why Alien is great, the movies from 3 onwards have consistently sucked. It's a simple concept! Hard science fiction, psychological horror, a practically unkillable monster, and retro futurism. I find it really hard to understand why the movies can't just get it right, lol.  Anyway this looks great, and I'm excited to play it!
This is gonna be one of the best chapters in the dead by daylight story, well done be haviour 👽
1:06 It looks like he says "Hello old friend" and at the end he says "Nostalgic isn't it?"
She looks like Nancy
I'm not cofident with the power of Alien, maybe he need to have a wall/jump too  but yeah it's pretty cool i guess.
More genius from an already genius game.
I would love to see predator next
Now I wait for a couple of more years for springtrap
Bruh
Ooooow mano ameiiiiii comprarei 2 vezes pra ter certeza que essa DLC vai ser minha 😂😂😂😂
They mostly come at night... mostly.
Finally they did it,was a long time ;)
Lt. Ellen Ripley ❤
wohoo
Ripley de survivor ja vou comprar muitooo!
cant wait to see everyone drop the xenomorph after two weeks!! we’re on a streak rn 😂
U guys really couldn't get the likeness for Sigourney Weaver but added Nick Cage?!?!?! I'll be honest I used to play DbD religiously but nerf after nerf after nerf of killers have made me put it away. I'll play survivor periodically, but even that gets stale and boring. Hoping you guys can properly balance the game at some point to bring back the players you have lost. I get that I'm not your target audience anymore as you want to attract new players, but I do miss the fun of the older version that the game has been lacking.
DAAAAMN
YAAAAYYYYY
Get ready! This is going to be just how it was when Wesker came out the first month. Back to back to back.....Alien games! Not complaining, just my prediction 😂
It's game over man
O trailer está maravilhoso, estou ansioso para jogar com ambos!
Now we just need FNAF and i might even reinstall the game! 😅
the map is very dissapointing
Let's gooooo
Finally!!
I’ve been DREAMING of them adding my girl Ripley to the game for years. I’m so fkn stoked.
Wow this looks awesome!  Ever since Evolve shut down I've not found a game that let's me play the "monster" since.  This is so well made it makes me want to get into this asap lol
New map ?
Fnaf next
Finally
HELLLLLLL YEAAAA Finally i thought about this but never ever i thought that this would come nice
YEEAAAAH
That release trailer was actually so good
If only they could make the character's in-game models look half as good as they look in trailers 🥲 I'm gonna call it, it's gonna be terrible.
Now when are we going to get Joe dirt as a survivor? 😂
When they released the end transmission dlc i alreyd knew about alien
After it Predator and Schwarzenegger GEEET TO THE CHOOOPA !
The cat is the real predator. ; )
Hadleys hope new map?
This shows the potential with BHVR and Dbd
So is Alien going to be like Demogorgon and travel underground or something similar?
I'm never gonna financially recover from this
Lets go. Ready to get hyped up
Nice!!!!What else you want to see as a franchise killer??For me Candyman and Jeeper's Creepers
I’m so excited
So sci-fi is this year's theme for Dead by Daylight
I want to see now Alien on Dead by Daylight :D
They couldn't licence the likeness of Sigourney Weaver? Sad.
Probably the most proficient killer in horror history… can’t wait to play him and act like a complete moron.
If only dbd looked that good
Kitty!
Ahora falta Predator 👍 Se de un streamer que no va ha estar contento por el alien jajajaja -13
THANK YOU DBD IVE BEEN WANTING THIS FOR FUCKING YEARS
Been calling it since middle school
In space no one can hear you in space
HOLY SWEET MOTHER OF SATANIC ODIN. THEY DID IT!
It’s finally happening
Letssss goooo!!!!  ima reinstall this game, i guess
LET'S GOOOOOOOO👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
The survivor perks are so op, as usual, that i wont play this chapter. What were you thinking? The games sound is already bugged and does not work half the time, the pallet traps need a limit to their amount or should have a cooldown of 120 seconds. "Map - The Game" will become unplayable for almost all killers with this perk.
I can't wait to become an Ellen Ripley main <333333
Alien Isolation ptsd intensifies
Another W for Dead by Daylight
If the alien can actually crawl through vents I’m dead in the first round
It’s game over man
A new map????
I have waited for this for so long and this is beutiful
Another Massive behavior W
Now all we need is Predator with Dutch..
Demogorgon v2
*_And so it begins…_*
This is so cool, will it come to mobile as well in the future? 😢
It actually makes me scared
Im jus saying, that cat best be in it.
Ok this is cool and all, but can we please pumpkin head.
OMMMG this is gonna be sooooo epic♥
NO WAY
Let me know! the alien ability is teleport!
Dbd mobile got laggy idk why 🤷🏽‍♂️
Project blue book
Classic Behavior W moment
OMGGGGGGG BHVR you did it!!
Please tell me there’s gonna be an Amanda legendary for Ridley :3
This is awesome… nerf pig
You know it’s good when there are more likes than views
Can't wait to play as the new killer! Cat.
I love alien but I need it please
very sad that we cant get chest bursted but this is still excellent props to bhvr for this!
Omg I’m living for this 😭😭😭😭
I can't wait
I love Ripley's expression of "This bitch again."
Damn the animation is amazing !
It's all fun and games until the alien gets hit by SPACE PALLETS
we've been waiting for this all our lives🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just want Alien Isolation 2 already 😭
I've been begging for a proper Alien Isolation sequel, this shall work
omg such a W
N colocaram o rosto da atriz, q triste 😢
Get away from her, you b###.
Hell yeah. Basically Alien isolation multiplayer
Remember guys, the flashlight bypasses a bag on the head, a pig head on the head, sun glasses and even the lack of eyes (confirmed by Demo).
Thank you people of dead by daylight
XENO ACTUALLY MADE IT BOYS
omg FINALLY we go him and her :)
Hyped to play before work, then I wait 5 minutes in loading and then theres a disconnect! Yay!!
Dud this trailer is SO good ❤
Espectacular, amazing and sugoi
Haaaaaaaaa ive been waiting so much 😍😍😍
He looks breedable
Ziii
I don’t even play this game and that was a cool trailer
Why you make RIpley look like the ginger in Sandlot?
SIUUUUU
Waitting Ripley perk showcase soon
wow wow wow im hyped!
RIPLEY MY QUEEN!
This looks very sick, Can't wait for Delirious to Play it when it comes out
😆 🤣 😂
This is so awesome. Obviously we all wanted this to happen someday, but there was definitely a part of me that thought it would never come, and now here it is.
damn son.. 🎉🎉
Trailer better then killer ngl
Good job the air's breathable, also looking at that trailer... maybe its going to be gas to stun the xenomorph not pallets.... hmmmm
If ripley wont say „get away from her you bitch“ I aint playing
❤❤❤❤
Wow, this is trailer is really POGGERS.
my dream lets goooo!!!!
Okay Dbd makin moves with Nick Cage and now Alien
Do we get a new map too? It wasn't clear if we get to run around the Nostromo or not
ummm.. she looks a lot like Nancy Wheeler..
So we can all agree if demogorgon is the dog then the xenomorph is the cat
Dead By Daylight really is the ultimate horror crossover. What will rhe future hold for this game...?
I hope we get a skin for Sigourney likeness in the future as well as Amanda cause that would be golden
This looks so good, immediately buying this on the 29. It’s a win win , Ripley and the xeno!?! I cannot wait to hunt, and I just can’t wait to try to focus on gens and for a xeno to just sneak up on me & chase me down. Ripley’s voice must have been hard to replicate if they couldn’t get sigourney. Either way thank you bhvr,  I’ve been asking for this on so many surveys.🥹🥳🎉🎉
trailers 10/10  gameplay 1/10
can't wait to see fnaf
BHVR  Will there be new mechanics in this map or will everything stay the same?
Alien coming soon, Nerf department is on standby.
Now we need Arnold and predator
Aprecien donde se fue el presupuesto de Nicolas Cage, Joder esto es demasiado epico, 😍
Lets gooo
I am in a huge amount of excitement
This so awesome but I wish they enter jason in the fog soon
Is there any new map too ?
Wow it's cool to see a new character specially created for the game instead of Ripley, Elisabeth or other known figures :)
Here comes the new troublesome killer of Survivors, who is very excited to come to destroy them all  🤩☺️🔥✊😎
@FirsEncounterAssault, bonito, ¿nos explicas tus poderes premonitorios, por favor? Ahora, bromas aparte, dime que te han contratado o van a usar tu música. Porfi.
This is DOPE! And Ripley as survivor is just 😙👌
I think we all know what the mori is going to look like.
so from what I understand there will also be smoke instead of the pallets to stun the killer?
HOH LEE SHEET! They actually did it! It's gonna be dope!
Predator: ok ok, I'm going to be the next one. Don't get nervous, get a grip, and prepare a good show...
The cat is a killer!?!
If they see,that this killer was got a lot old players back and get 100000+ sells,bhvr will do more licensed killers like friday 13th and more
NICE AND SCARY!  What a fan of Aliens needs!  My only complaint is why is it so difficult for game designers to understand that the xenomorph are supposed to scare the crap out of fans?  You guys seem to understand this simple concept.
I refuse to kill Ripley… Ever!!! Farming is one thing but I refuse to kill her.
this trailer is the best they have ever done
1:21 please tell me it’s not a speed killer due to this scene, WE HAVE TOO MANY SPEED KILLERS edit:ok i actually watched the full trailer, i think this is gonna be just demogorgon.
Im so excited to buy the alien chapter with sigorney weavers character ripley as a survivor. I look forward to trying out this new lisrnced chapter in dbd on august twenty ninth. Thank you for posting this new trailer for i cant wait to test this out first in the public test build then get the chapter on th release date august twenty ninth as well.
A little upset we don't get to play on the nestromo or one of the ships as a new map. But I'm still Hella excited
🎉🎉🎉yes .. alien finally
Would love to see chucky come to this game 😂.
Kinda wish they would’ve added the girl from Prometheus too
This will.most definitely make me comeback
It was programmed to harm the crew.
yeah until players sit there trolling you with a flashlight and dancing at the exit
Keep the xeno's name out ya fucking mouth!
Super excited for Alien!
Damnnnnnnz
this is exciting and all, but my dumbass really wanted predator to be a survivor. I know it would've never happened but still funny to me.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
OMG omg omg this is sick!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ooh this is great, they've done such a great job, and they even brought Jonesy the cat!! Hoping so much that we get an Alien Isolation sequel out of this if it's popular.
Yesssssss
I have to give credit where it's due, I did not expect them to get the license. Good job guys.
DBD could do a pretty cool collab with Warhammer 40k, give an Adeptus Mechanicus skin. The Knight can get a Khorne skin, oni can get Angron.
Beautiful 🙌
This drops on August , fucking nice
can we get the terminator as a killer now too?
Please bring chucky next and my life will be complete 😩
Finally claudette isnt the one hooked
YESSSSSIRRRRRRRRRRR
thats the thing from Mortal kombat X 😱
I am still excited though this is easily the most detailed chapter watch the ptb it is so creative great job behavior
is the cat okay tho?
Was expecting alien or preditor, never though it would actually happen. But if be very very supprised if both emd up in thr game
Aww the kitty 🐱 meow!
These fan trailers getting wild   WAIT A MINUTE
Make sure we get Narrator for the release trailer please!!!
Yes! Finally!
btw this is an animation for a SINGLE update compare this to another life service game
Wish the quality was the same as the trailer 😂
This is the best thing to happen to dbd in YEARS and all I’m here for it
YES! I want this now!
The Xenomorph can face off against Ash Williams, Cheryl Mason, Jill Valentine, and Nicholas god damn Cage.  This game is the greatest, I don't make the rules.
Why hang ‘em when you can hunt them
Oh man this is gonna be fun 😅 hopefully the map is good
So you can use vents as killer and smoke trap as survivor
Oh, this is so awesome! Hope someone is gonna make a movie about this sheeeeeeet!!!
I waited Apollion for For Honor collab, but this is really amazing
"Game over, man! Game over!" — Hudson
CATT!!!!
Unfortunately, She doesn’t look exactly like Sigourney Weaver. Looks like Nancy. So sad, hope they’ll fix that
I FREAKING WAS WAITING FOR THIS!!! Finally i can play as an xenomorph
LESSGOOO 😭
Ripley!!!!
Ellen Ripley from Wish
Mmm so Is he gonna have a teleport ability where he goes through holes?
super nice good.
Dbd amogus chapter when?
i can’t wait to see the alien variant cosmetics..there are gonna be variants right ?
Waiting for Chucky.
goood
Ripley is 1.8m tall, is this survivor gonna be tall as actress?
Let's GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! Jason next!!!! DBD is BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please, bring Terminator and Sarah connor too
good job
Big w
LET'S GOOOO RIPLEY
the map needs to be a close map only or at least 90% inside the nostromos, the real map is disappointing is like a copy of toba with 1% nostromos
Уфф надеюсь карта будет просто офигенной, как и сам ман
Please add the spring trap killer❤
It's been 84 years ...
I hope you dont fuck up
cool
LETS GOOOOOOOO! I NEEDED THIS
ripley dropping a pallet is hilarious
Jonesy!
So you can kill Nicholas Cage as an Alien. DBD really is the best game ever.
I STILL CANT BELIEVE YALL GOT THE LICENSE FOR THIS!!!!
Finalmente vão lançar o et bilu
In space, no one can hear you scream.
It would be cool if we get the neomorph and deacon as skins
OMG i remember years ago every time a licenced chapter were anbounced i was always hoping for this and finnaly it happened
Only waited til my entire friend group quit playing before doing it
Let's gooooo!
I think the alien just vented
I think yours skills will look like demogorgon’s
At my sister's birthday ^^
Trailer looks great but I wish there was an actual new Aliens game (not that I have anything against Dead by Daylight).
My bigger question is—  Will Sigourney herself voice her titular character?
Finally a female character who isn’t on some stupid girl boss shit and an actual badass woman character, let’s go Ripley 😍
This is one of the most terrifying trailers for a dbd killer, so fucking happy you got this license
Sigourneys beautiful hair as well 😮
Just to reiterate did I just watch a movie or a DBD trailer?
I saw the last week's trailer couple of hours ago and it said "more at 8/8" and looked for it and didn't find now it came to my feed, happy days
one more shit, i still hope dbd will be like in 2016-2019
What Alien Isolation Multiplayer should have been... cool.
Ooomaga
How they gonna make it balanced?? Very interesting
Demagorgon replacement is here!
I literally can't wait for this
i feel like the xenomorph is gonna be very close to demodogo. Climbing through environment somehow and a leap attack for sure. But they could also do like an acid split... OH, and an add on that when pallet dropped the survivor gets injured! Acid blood add on, hopefully a yellow. Sounds balanced, behavior get to it!
Most wanted license, thank you BHVR ❤
I can’t wait to see every survivor and killer have the new survivor in game and same for killer
Waited so long for this
Dbd literally just pulling the Fortnite card of shoving as much iconic characters/creatures as possible into game.
Now please manage to collab with and add spring trap in the game 🙏
TAKE MY MONEY
What's next, Predator And Dutch?
Oh boy! Here I go killing again!
Bro 2 space chapters after eachother? Damn
i think we all know the real killer is the random cat they decided to add here   jokes aside i cant wait for the alien
Ellen doesn’t look like Ellen but pretty cool stuff
My initial is reaction is "damn, maybe it's time to come back". But man, I have such a love/hate relationship with BE.
Is Jonesy going to be a playable character?
WE GETTING OUT THE NOSTROMO WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥
Aí gente, se não trouxessem a Ripley eu ia ficar puto. Mulher mais icônica da série!
i wish they took the trailer chase music over the ingame music instead
This looks great! Think the game overall needs a graphical refresh still, maybe unreal 5?
Now thats a trailer. Nicely done there.
Really fucking cool we get the whole package map killer and surv lets go excited for the killer abilities and map
Now we need springtrap...
I swear if they add another dark map it’s gonna make the game even harder to play. I can’t even see where I’m walking on the dark maps it’s unplayable.
Oyşş
dream come true finally
Second part of Alien Isolation 😮😮😮😮
I can’t wait for the new Jonesy killer
New map😢😢
waiting for the scooby doo DLC <3
I wanna boop the lil puppy 😊
Where the heck is the little mouth! Missed opportunity in the trailer to reveal it when she was looking away and his face popes up beside her.and where is weaver? Whats the point of alien if shes not there.. who cares about alien we wanted weaver. This is BS
Now THIS is a legendary crossover. I like it
Nah this chapter looks sick asf
Nice. I get to play as Mommy Ellen! I grew up crushing on these female leads...
DBD now interests me.
Одна из лучших глав которые только были в DbD❤
Gooood
if they don’t add Predator at some point imma be sincerely disappointed
1:07 Alien: *WAT WAS DAT!?*
Ive had zero interest in this game since day one but after this trailer i have no choice but to buy the game.
Okey.. So is finaly, this time to come back to this game and thsi time not only suriveve but also kill... Fantastic!
Now the game will be great, should have the predator in the future
This is one step closer for a Predator collaboration and I am all for it!
I already see the problem with this killer it’s gonna get toxic for us Survivor mains 😕
Wow new alien killer ❤
После рофляного Коли Клеткина они добавили в игру что-то реально страшное, вспомнили, что игра-то хоррор, ну молодцы, чо🎉
Demogorgon 2.0?
I love this this is gonna be awesome i cant wait to play as the Alien 😜 this is a huge W
Our prayers have been answered 🙏
I dont play so idk but adding aliens to something that seems paranormal with the entity idk just feels off or feels like a shitty horror movie that cant pick a lane but ehhh if anyone likes good on ya
Im never playing anything else ever again
So far, I have a feeling that this is going to be the most terrifying chapter in Dead by Daylight!
You know when the hype train has entered the station when a video has more likes then views....lol
So who’s ready for the killer to be absolutely bad and nerfed??? Looks amazing tho. Survivor perks broken like always tho???
This will bring me back to DBD after months of not plying
the OG scence at 1:38 love it
And the Pantheon of killers grows.
As happy as i am that Alien is finally coming to dbd i am a bit dissapointed that it seems like its ability will be like the demodoggys and sadakos, which its practically venting. I hope im wrong because there is so much potential when it comes to alien, i am excited for the skins we might be getting.  I do wonder what we'll get for ripley, making her an evasive or stealthier survivor seems like a good idea, I cant wait to read up on the perks
No new map 👎🏾
Imagine we actually get a space map with it as well
There’s gotta be a predator too soon🔥
Ripley's cousin as surv. Cool
Im so happy!
so like can the steam be a new stun mechanic?
This trailer has just been released and i all ready got spooked by the Xenomorph's appearance. I know for sure I'm NOT ready for the mori. Hats off to you guys for announcing the iconic killers in Dbd. 💀💀💀
Now there is a reason for me to play this game
Better demo I'm predicting
Add Winnie the Pooh blood and Honey to the game
No exosuits to save us this time...
And predator
I was so deeply hoping for Sigourney Weaver but this is still great
Mds eu tô em choque!!! Isso tá perfeito demais 🥹🥹😍
Y always Dwight man
EVERYONE SAID IT COULDN'T HAPPEN BUT I SAID IT COULD I WAS RIGHT HAHAHAHA
It's going to be fireeeee !
Oh my
You’re telling me this couldn’t have been released for the anniversary
I can hear the workshop community for garrymod just in my hear
where is predator ?
Will we be able to pet the cat?
this has the potential to be one of the best if not the best chapter even! so excited to play when it fully releases
This game trasg
First we got Cage now alien. The devs know what’s up.
IM SO EXCITED
Nice but the survivor doesn’t look like sigourney hmmm
NO, LET THE CAT GO ENTITY
The mad lads did it
If the dev team actually did there- No I’m kidden. (:  I’m excited to see this little devil in the game. (:
So they can't get the licence for predator but they got alien?
My favorite horror movie finally made it in ❤ Thank you so much BHVR!!!
I hope the kitty is a survivor
OMG OMG OMG!! QUE EMOCIONADA ESTOY AAAAA GRACIAAAAAS DBD!! TE AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
I really hope they do something unique with the killer ability and not just do a demo lunge attack
IS IT ACTUALLY SIGOURNEY THO??
Welp time to redownload
0:51 rip dwight :(
I can't wait!
This is So BADASS
Мда, обновление выходят чаще чем рождаются Китайцы
feels like watching one of movie sccene
CATS ARE IN DBD YESSS!
Hear me out, what if you can have multiple alien killers with more survivors on a bigger map, so like 3 killers to 12 survivors
Rarithlynx would be proud
Predator when?
Any chance to see Mother Miranda from Resident Evil in the future? 👀
Predator! Predator! Predator!
Oh my god i am SO HYPED. Alien is my fav sci fi horror movie. To have this in DBD is a dream! ❤🎉 Well done team! Can't wait to see how it turns out!
So it has the same power as dredge gut without lockers
I'm telling you, no other horror survival game is beating dead by daylight. Then we have a studio that's listening to feedback.
What'll be next? The Terminator?
First time Not seeing any Trash talking under Something bhvr Posts. Pls keep it Like that and pretty good Job so far bhvr
Wow😮
This chapter is for us 90s baby you lil kids wouldn’t even understand. Screw nichols cage imma ripley main now 😎
SUCH AN AMAZING TRAILER
this ain't bad
the only good thing to come out of the alien franchise since alien isolation, and I haven't tried fireteam yet so idk if thats good
Estaría bueno q en lugar del palet, tengan una variante del vapor para ese mapa o algunos otros en los q les quede =o
That's fucking amazing.
Am I the only one excited for predator now
I told you it could vent.
Add Predator as well lol
can't wait to see jason voorhees
THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING!!
The horror come faster 🔥🔥
A bit of a missed opportunity for a cool inside map with the broken ship, but I'll let it slide BECAUSE WE FINALLY GOT ALIEN! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!
“It’s game over man, game over!”  I’ve been waiting for this ever since the Demogorgan got added! Thank u BHVR
DBD slowly becoming the smash bros of horror films. ya love to see it.
Is that guy from fortnite?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
In space, no one can hear you scream
L, gimme predator then I’ll celebrate
Fine i'll play dbd again
I wonder there'll be a Queen's skin available ?
Idk what I’m more excited for, The Most Badass Female Character that’s ever existed, Or one of the creepiest (and coolest) monsters that ever existed
As someone who played DBD around a year ago and thought, "meh it's alright." I am redownloading it just for this.
RIPLEY MI AMOOOOR
0:51 of course they always kill the dwight
Is this on consoles
i hope they make a Predator DLC to ,Dead by Daylight RULES
Dead By Daylight if you were a person I’d kiss you rn
Expectedly unexpected
I NEED this. Hey BHVR, you mind taking my money early? I’m buying it immediately after it releases.
Trailers really be showing that every Dwight fucking sucks😂
L in the comments for our boi Dwight o7
Omg you guys 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
Im sure it wont completely suck         SIKE
This looks slick, might go back to play it again
imagine we also get a predator colab as well
Wow, they been really going heavy with the Sci fi chapters recently, no complaints 👌
The only survivor I will actually buy, mfing Ripley!!
Please don't have a map traversal mechanic.
Ripley wife beater/underwear skin please. 😏
I Wonder what is gonna be the ability of the xeno, stealth ?traveling tunnel, super rush, long range attack?theres too many possibility in this trailer 😂
OMGGGGG
It's perfect after all these years it finally here
IVE WAITED YEEEARS YEEEESSSSSSSS
please tell me thats not supposd to be ripley
They are adding the smartest and most badass movie character to the game. Sigourney Weaver. I mean, Ellen Ripley.
yeeeeeeesssssssss
This is a massive W folks.
No new map????
amazing game <3
less goo
AAAAHH IM SO HYPED!!
Ok now we need Jason
I remember as a kid my family would bust out our Aliens DVD collection, pop popcorn, and gather in the living room to binge the whole series. Those were great times and made me an avid fan on the franchise along with H.R. Giger's work. Least to say I am incredibly excited for this. Though I  can't say I am a huge DBD fan, I hope this turns out well!
I kinda liked how the alien just got right next to Ridley and let out a hiss, as if it was saying "I'm back....."
Demodog aint nearly as scary as xenocat-   I mean even ita smile just screams "Im going to enjoy nibbling on your eyeballs."
Now we need Jason and tommy
Callate! Y toma mi dinero!🚬🗿
I guess they didnt get the likeness rights to Weaver, which is odd, they got the looks down for every other licensed character.
While i absolutely do not enjoy this game at all, I do like seeing all the franchise monsters etc they can get into it.  Looks cool, just not for me.
I wonder how they will incorporate the killer being blind and being able to see only through echo-location/sounds.
YOU DID US RIGHT DBD THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH PLZ SLENDERNAN LAYER HES AN UNDERRATED HORROR ICON BUT THIS IS ANAZING!
Ouuu i played a lot before dbd 1200 hrs but thats now about a year that i didnt play tired😂 so maybe i ll be back😮😅
He vent
Boy oh boy I can’t wait for the demogorgon clone
Two years ago when I started playing DBD I told to my friends: "Imagine if we had the Alien and Jason - it would be insane". Two years now into the present: well would you look at that? o_O
Just wish the released it a couple of years ago when the game was much more fun.
Complimenti ai creatori che stanno facendo tutto questo lavoro per portarci tutti questi Survivor e killer🎉
Shame they couldn’t get predator though.
Game over man game over
Holy
Killers camping hook even on the trailers SMH
Epic gamer moment.
I really didn't think this day would never happen after not getting the predator. I really thought alien wasn't going to show up
Predator next
Looks amazing but does no one else think they gave Ripley weirdly huge anime eyes like what's going on there
I hope they just didn't add 2 new characters and not a new game mode smh.
GOOOOOOOOOOOD
Елен Ріплі зовсім не Сігурні. Могли б і не пожаднічати на її образі.
Thats not Ripley
Please just give us a sequel to isolation
This alien is copied from Resident Evil 4 game, in that too Leon kills it in the same way😅😅😅😅
idc, where’s the original pennywise
I was not this hyped in a PTB for over a year this is AWESOME
Canonically, why would the alien bother putting a survivor on a hook.   Just a fun thought, no hate or "☝️🤓"
About time. Im about to become a ripley main
Tranitango ala versión de Android tambien
Does this mean we can get rid of the skull merchant?
I love how they actually employed game play methods from dead by daylight like her, hopping the cargo and pushing over that pallet
We have been waiting for this kind of killer
Oh my god
Caption didnt miss. So many click bait titles
I always dreamed of this day since Leatherface was introduced. Ever so slowly, you are bringing all of my all-time-favorite iconic killers to DBD. Now if only I could have Child's Play Chucky and Kayako from the Grudge <3
What the spotlight for this?
Bro thats insane
Nice one finally I can go back play dead by dayligth again
Yes sir, BHVR has restored my faith in them
HOLY SHIT I AXTUALLY PREDICTED THE MOVE SET AND MECHANIC IN A COMMENT I MADE
FINE, take my money 💰!😢😢😢
My guess to the power is the alien has vents around the map and has a second of super speed but idk it could be anything at this point cant wait
RAGHHH THE THING
We should get Jacket from Hotline Miami, Vanny from Security Breach, and a Bloater from The Last of Us
Finally, it's been 84 years
Can we get a Ripley skin of her in her underwear? Lol😂
🎮
I may die a happy man
Imagine waking up from a nap and realizing you’re mid DbD match.
My only gripe… that is not Sigourney weaver
Can’t wait for another killer that gets forgotten after 2 days.
Damn, I’m surprised Dead by Groomers is still doing stuff like this.
يااخي ليش الموبايل ما يسوون هيج النا ملتهين ينزلون سكنات سخيفة اللعبة غبية
I guess they couldn't get Sigourney Weaver's likeness? That's kind of a bummer, she still looks cool though.
Missed oportunity to use Sigourney Weaver's likeness. But yea, other than this minor detail, I look forward to this one. Time to dive back in the game.
YEAAAAHHH THEY GAVE US ELLEN RIPLEY!!! Fantastic!
I hope steam is a real pallet alternative. I want more dynamic maps more than anything 😭
No body is going to talk about the cat @0:21 ? 🤣
oml finally
This is a BIG upgrade from the last few chapters we have had. And I will finally have a chance to play with my friends again
I hope this is going to be a new map looks so small and narrow
Now if we wait 2 months maybe itll be time for springtrap
Please, bring us springtrap next! No more lame original killers, we just need the fnaf spin off 😢😢😢
Just when I thought I'd got out, Dead By Daylight just drags me back in (。_。)
I’m literally screaming
Wow omg love this Ttrailer, goosebumps!
This is awesome
LET’S FUCKING GET!
I need to know if Jonesy is okay
No way
So console get it on the 29th ?
My god I love it
Can’t wait for the new f tier killer and insane op ripley perks
tomorrow is my birthday :D
The greatest day of my life will be when this releases
I think they didn’t get the rights to represent sigourney..
Oh my wallet is gonna suffer
Welp, guess I gotta start playing dbd again lol.
Siiiiiii porfinnnnn
wtf is that menu music
This is really exciting. Would have been so cool to get a map associated with this chapter, though.
This looks so good
Unbefrickinlievable!
Alright fine, I will play dead by daylight again 😅
Will there be a feng skin for this chapter?
this is so so so good!
The first alien movie made me so scared when I was a kid. And this trailer brings back that feeling.
Anyone else think they might just copy paste and maybe slightly alter the demogorgons playstyle for this
im so excited for this new chapter, especially for the new cat survivour that otz himself voiced
cool, but i'm still waiting for Predator :)
I'll be honest I didn't think this was gonna happen I figured they'd just make a skin for demo that looked like alien now for them to make a stealth killer that's predator
I like how that’s coming out, but we need the cat on Ellen’s back for a cosmetic tbh
The perfect organism. I admire it's purity and unclouded judgement. What are our chances? I can't lie about your chances ,but you have my sympathy.
That dont Look like dbd 🫨
This looks so cool😮
I love this but is the survivor supposed to be Ripley? Doesn't quite look right.
Holy crap, this is going to make me play DBD finally omg omg
add cat pet for ellen into a game
Dam I might have to reinstall the game which will be interesting since i haven’t played since wesker
Oof no new map
😮😮😮😮😮😮
OH BABY!!!
Fuck, I've waited years for this
Now We just need Pennywise !
it wasn’t alienated to harm the crew
Let's see how long nicolas cage will last on this map
FIX SPINE CHILL PLEASE
It looks so reall , bhvr really upped the ante !!
Alien: Isolation 😂😂😂
This is the first Ripley that isn't Signourney Weaver ahahahahahaha
>films it in a space-station-esque map >doesn't include a space-station-esque map  where is my Nostromo
oh man this is what ive been waiting for, never ever would i have thought they'd manage to get the alien IP and i get to play as xenomorph
Bro she looks nothing like ripley lmao great alien model though
You know she was suppose to be in them panties coming out of that pod…
Bro that was the SCARIEST KILLER i've ever seen on DBD,  I hope its just as scary as it is in the trailer~!
Glad to see my childhood favorite finally make it.
The xenomorph, an advanced intelligent life-form will finally meet their match, A lousy pallet
Still waiting Springtrap
Man… its gonna be so much fun!! i cant wait!
im guessing the next Killer will be a Yautja, maybe with a Arnold Skin.
Whenever you are the objective is the same fix gen or hanging person 😂
Please tell me that was the chase theme it sounds incredible 1:21
First day buy going to grind for blood to upgrade it hard
Possibility kills:   Little mouth kill Tail kill  Least possible kill   Acid kill  Face hugger kill
as a wise man once said ''my body is ready''
It's enough to make a grown man cry...
NO FREAKING WAY
Im shaking guys
This kills everyone that claims that DBD is a dead game.
19k views and 23k likes? The trailer is so good even people who didn’t watch the video liked it lmao
Seems like Demi from Stranger Things, the vent looks similar to the portals. I would like to guess that since Demi probably won't come back ever, Alien is kind of like a replacement for Demi for those who didn't purchase Stranger Things pack before it became unavailable.
Im so hyped!!!
Otz really did an amazing job voice acting 0:22
new survivor item: flamethrower, instantly kills the killer
Wow. A demomorph, that is just disrespectful to this horror icon. You can  tell they can't be bothered
So cool
you ruined a long awaited dlc what did you think while doing this? xd it has been killer so bad
Can the kitty be a survivor plz?
ripleyyyyyy
Nice
We now need predator and dutch . Get critters in there also ghoulies , leprechaun pumpkinhead
Man y’all could’ve got so many better licenses but y’all went with a trash movie from like 50 years ago
I love how little they showed the alien, very close to the movie
1:10 Renewable "pallet" mechanic.
On behalf of gamers everywhere   FINALLY!
No way alien I'm playing killer forever.
A new map too PLEASE
Pop off dbd ok I see you
Great alien wonder how it will play. Cus it's gonna be the hardest killer to make accurate to what it is.  Tail working as weapon along with claws and mouth walking on walls ect.  I just think as good as this looks it's gonna be nothing like alien we all think of.
Imagine they snipped in Predator
Guys I think it was programmed to harm the crew
I admire it’s purity.
I'm so hoping Sigourney Weaver voiced Ripley ❤
The new survivor Loretta Goggi looks incredible
Trailer is cool , but I think xenomorph just won't fit with DBD gameplay. Its too slow and xeno is all about speed, agility and stealth.
My God this is the best killer yet.
Ripleyyyyyyyy so happy Def gonna be my main
This is amazing this also, unfortunately, Lynn’s more to the rumor that the school merchant was originally supposed to be the predator
Ripley and Alien
demo and nancy part 2? 💀😂
I was hoping they would never do it because now the survivor community is gonna do nothing but bitch moan and groan and poor xenomorph is gonna get nerfed into the ground because little timmy didn’t notice it till it got him or light up the xenomorph a bit make it easier to see it
The most important question: will the CAT🐈 be in the game?  If not, then I'll be very disappointed...
please create next time a new killer like a dragon
Ok this has sold me. Definitely going to try out dead by daylight.
YESSSS RIPLEYY
i have one request: stop milking my wallet with these awesome characters that i have no choice but to buy because i love these franchises. your gonna put me in debt.
I feel like in a couple of months we’re gonna get a certain invisible hunter in a jungle…
Holy this is going to be a great dlc
No flamethrower ?
Amazing Trailer. This kinda looked like the ship only had god pallets tho haha
based
ABOUT TIME, Can't wait to see the Xenomorph in the Fog, it's gonna be badass
What a perfect organism
How does this video have 18K views and 22K likes? YouTube what are you up to! FYI loved the trailer
It always hits my guy Dwight
HYYYYYYYYYYYYPE
Better have the grid skin
Ripley's looks is different.. probably they didn't get the rights using sigourney weaver's face
It’s game over man game over
I can't watch Dead by Daylight much, I get bored very easily. But I'm 100% sure that I will be addicted to watching Alien, if it actually has some Xenomorph mechanics, which I don't expect... :/
cant wait to use him, one of the few times im actually excited to use a killer. Lets gooo
Interesting
BRASILEIROS??????? HYPE A MILLLLLL
Ripley and The Xenomorph are insane additions, but Jonsey was in this trailer... I just hope he makes it through okay like he did in the movies!
so sick! but surely when showing off the trailer there was going to be a new map!
Wow. They put not only the xenomorph, but also, Ellen Ripley. That's amazing.
the killer is very weak showing not running in her ability to run
i am so excited about the new update thanks dbd
Best game ever made
August 29 for the PTB or the alien in the game ?
It's official now. I want to see a cat somewhere hidden on the map as the Easter egg.
I like to see another game try and have Xenomorph chasing down Bill from left for dead, Nancy Wheeler, Ash Williams, and Nicholas Cage in Haddonfield
Wow wow wow 🎉
where springtrap
ive been waiting for this for forever XDDDDDDDD IS FINALLY HEREEEEEEE
trash
That'll do behavior,That'll do.
With a date like August 29th... why didn't they do Terminator?
Send it
Al fin!!!
1:36  don't know why but this music is a banger🔥
CAT Caaat
🐱
FN awesome!
Amazing trailer apart from the fact thats a horrible face model and looks nothing like ripley, shame
Our beloved cat better survive every time or i will be one very sad spirit main
OMG this is insane! New mechanics? The map itself looks like it's going to be stunning!
perfect chapter.
Awesome
I've played on and off since the game came out but this dlc has had me playing about 3 hours a day waiting for it. I'm unbelievably hyped! The Xenomorph is one of my favorite horror creatures and I also love Ripley! This trailer is beautiful so please make the perks and killer good!!
все не плохо,но будет выглядеть тупо когда чужой будет кого то вешать на крюк
Springtrap plis noviembre
Behaviour always makes us happy with each update, keep up the good work!!
Cat based survivor perk?
Predator vs Arnold when??
This is sooooo awesome! it makes me think what other horrible killers from movies they can add in the future, a hills have eyes crossover in a dark mine would be insane! Long live DBD!!
Add MnK support on console
マップのイメージがホーキンスみたいな感じに見えるけどどうなんだろう
صرخت دوايت😂😂
Someone’s gotta say it. that doesn’t like like ripley. The face looks so off from Weavers face
Not bad
now the game is in the real horror omg
I am excited to find out what kind of powers the xenomorph will have. Maybe stealth? Maybe an ability similar to the Demogorgon to travel/teleport through tunnels? Controlling facehuggers ? A Tailswipe?
Now we wait for Behavior to get license for "Predator" killer, and "Arnold Schwarzenegger" survivor...
"that's one ugly motherf*cker!"
Imagine if they give alien a legendary skin, wonder what it would look like 🤔
Next we need Chucky
Pls dont be a teleporting killer like sadako or demo ...
When I saw Josney in the teaser trailer. I know the new survivor is going to be Ellen Ripley and now is true.
They could have made a much more accurate digital clone of Sigourney Weaver.
time to download dbd once again
That was so cool bro. If only I was in the game
i love dbd and this will make me love it more
THIS IS CALLED REAL CHARACTERS I MEAN THE ALIEN LOOKS SO SCARY AND SURVIVOR LOOKS SO REAL  LIKE NIKOLAS ....OMG
Wait so will we be able to use the smoke to stun the killer instead of pullets on this map?
They listened to us…
Oh hells yes
Algo bueno en el jueguito, al fin
Consider my pants shitted
Does anyone else see that is just kinda looks like demogorgan gameplay The lunge and the fast travel
Stop tunneling Alien
I didn’t expect a survivor too. This is awesome :)
It's isolation all over again
Period.
This is the best 4 v 1 game ever 💜 keep going 🏆
Is this the reason i start playing dead by daylight 😂
i wonder if this is gonna be a demogrogon reskin
fuck yes
Yeah, the xenomorph is known to throw humans up on hooks...
XENOMORPH!
Waiting for the Predators
the devs are cooking
Alien is camping, reported
I have been hoping for so long to get to play as a Xenomorph this is amazing. Keep on being wonderful devs. and heres to another 5 years of DbD.
YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. Pallet stun acid blood or  i riot
You guys actually did this😮
I loved it when the daylight died
rip the dwight
Omg take my money
I’m gonna be honest, I’ll legit shit myself if I’m being chased by Alien. As if The Dredge or Michael Myers was enough for me to handle.😅
Please tell me we are getting a nostromo map as well.
Let's go
I really thought it would've been hilarious if predator came and killed Alien and we got predator instead 😂
Face huggers 👀
My sexy boy finally made it to dbd
Are voice lines for Ripley too much to hope for?🤞🏻 I CANNOT WAIT
Predator and Dutch when?
cool
What a refreshing change. ♡
WOOHOOOO NEW SURVIVOR LOOKS SO COOL
I want jeepers creepers like if you agree
And when theres an Alien. There's nost likely gonna be a Predator too
Let's gooo! My favourite horror franchise is finally in DBD. Thank you Behaviour!
Best gaming company ever
Clause 88c of your employment agreement has come into effect
BHVR listens to the fans and that’s why dead by daylight is amazing 🤘🏻
Demogorgon  2.0
YESYESYESYESYESYES
Oh mi gosh ... oh mi gosh <3
Nic Cage Vs Alien
So is the map indoor, outdoor or both?
Please add Corporal Hicks as the second Survivor in this dlc.
It was program to harm the crew
My guess is he’ll have a tunnel system he can use to act like Demo’s portals but he can’t place them.
Girl look like Rembo
next killer predator boys lets go
Alien is blind right?
Bring your brown trousers, it's xeno time!
Wonder where his ability will be will he be able to go through vents like he did in the trailer? Well, he have a pounce animation like the demo Gorgon will be able to run dash on all fours like the blight
Insta buy!
I hope the cat is on the map somewhere XD
Bro just vented
Finally man...FINALLY! I HAVE WANTED THIS FOR YEARS!Thank you Behavior!
This looks amazing, can’t wait until we get to play as ALIEN!
Yall suprise me everytime
Do you know why this looks good? No space marines.
I just find it funny that Dwight of all people is hanging on the hook 😂
Nice, no new map?
One of the community's biggest fantasy IPs realized!
finally i can play as ripley
i love it <3
Dwayne Hicks should have been the survivor.  "Thats it man, game over man, game over. What the fuck are we gonna do now?"
damm, seems i´ll be going back into the fog.  BTW, is it just me or did anyone else found ripley to sometimes look a bit like nancy?
Now all we need is the springtrap killer
If Jones the cat isn’t invincibly prowling around this map then I will be unhappy. Then again…. It didn’t say at the end that there was a new map… that’ll be even more disappointing
I hope they actually let killers go into the vents. Or at least have vents that are alien and victor sized
So cool!!
Strenger things vibe
Really wanted Jason but my childhood nightmares will do
As an alien fan, I’m crying 😢
1 minute into the trailer and killer already camping hook.  SOOOOOO DBD.
Omg my most favorite classic horror movie is in Dead by Daylight! Thank you DBD Team!
Predator next? 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀 this looks sick as fuck
The alien is using hooks lol?
I was so hyped for this but the trailer loterally just scream demo, im worried
Love this! Can’t wait!
Tá porra que trailer é esse top demais....
Yesss! Finally!! Iv predicted and wanted this for so long! I'm hoping a map comes with it❤❤
Very cool.  Though in a no weapon situation I don't think the Alien would ever lose.
Love Alien so much, great fit for dbd! The only thing I have an issue with is that the xenemorph hooks survivors? I think it looks a little silly. Maybe he should’ve slotted them into a wall or something instead? Apart from that, amazing!
No way he was camping in the trailer lmao
エイリアン楽しみ！
Now just waiting for ohmwrecker to play
Same energy as the Smash Ultimate E3 Ridley trailer
Hm, this might actually make me reinstall the game just to try this chapter out :P Would be cool if the map actually has these steam vents as a unique Killer stun mechanic 😊
Pallets, signature of this game.
I'll be honest, I have been thinking about the Xenomorph (and the predator) being in this game since the first licenced characters were coming out but I assumed it was never going to happen.
demo back in game ! so nice. I want to play that type of killer so badly since I missed it
I’ve been waiting for this since I started…   YEEEEEES
I wait for predator
RIPLEYY!!!! 👑👑👑💃💃💃 LORD 🙏 if there is not a line of her saying “get away from her you BETCH” i call first on the chest-burstin 🤡
The fact the xenomorph wasn't in the game already shocks me
i think they did a pretty good job this time
I love it
Just when you think they can't get any better, BAM!
This is better than Covenant
I like Ripley's expression when she first reacts to the Xeno behind her. Like she was thinking something like: "Aw great, not this bitch again." Like she is so over it by this point.
Loved the first two movies, fuck alien 3...
that really doesnt look like ripley...kinda dissapointed tbh
FINALMENTEEE
licensed killers are the best
Next killer The NUN , make it happen
This trailer is so well made. It makes it even more exciting to know that this is finally happening and coming to the amazing Dead by Daylight game. Props to BHVR and their developer team!
This is a genius idea
can we pet the cat tho?
now all we need is predator
I like it. Alien looks great! But Ellen Ripley...they need to tweak up her face; it doesn't look like her.
Yeeaaah i'm waiting so looong for this dlc
What was the fate of the cat,
Looks better than I could’ve imagined, can’t wait to see how it plays
Well fucking done guys!
W
FIRST
Released the trailer same day August Update was released for the mobile version 😎😎😎  (we do not care)
It certainly looks like it wasn't programmed to harm the crew
IN THREE WEEKS?
🖤💚🖤
God ripley so deserves to be in this game as one of the greatest final girls
CHANGE THE MORI
„I think we did a pretty good job so far.“ Yes you did.
Ripley will be hunting down the killers, most badass hero in horror!
Ah too bad they couldn't get Sigourney's face for this. Still love how committed the developers of this game are with all these franchise collabs, good quality promo trailer overall.
this is freaking epic, i love the way this trailer is animated
Any chance this is a reskinned Demodog with similar mechanics and all?
Couple years late :( when my friends and I no longer play together
Where’s Jason at thooooo😩
Очень жду эту главу. Разработчики спасибо вам большое!! Ждала долго. Очень не хватает монстроподобных маньяков в игре! Выглядит улётно
Now just imagine if BHVR added David… or modeled the Neomorph as a skin variant
I loved the classic scene throwback in there. I'm so excited for this one!
I will never be able to wrap my head around how this studio gets such large ip's. But high props to behaviour. you guys nailed it again!
Okay, but when do we get Morbius?
Isn't it about time you guys make a Dead by Daylight 2 or change the game modes up?
RIP Dwight ;-; (for the millionth time lmao)
I want alien to be op I dont even care. I'd hate to see my favorite horror monster be some weak killer
END OF THIS MONTH!?!?!?
Looks interesting, maybe i`ll return to this game again. Hope the Xeno can walk on the walls and different surfaces, as thats a major part of the xeno. Also i get that hooks are a huge part of the game. But Xenos ussualy stick people to the wall in half cocoon type constructs. Wouldnt it be possible to implement that as a hook only with different visuals?
YESSSS
When is coming out for Playstation 4
I will like it if its not another gen patroller
LET'S FAKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
I imagine the next chapter is the prowler from 1981 horror movie
sickkkkkkkk
Why am I not suprised? When The Xenomorph was announced I knew Ripley was going to be a new survivor.
Okayyy... and for our next trick... who thinks the next killer would be The Predator?
Dbd I am a massive fan of alien so thanks for bringing this to my favourite game
urban evasion meta incoming xD
This is SICK!
so dissapointed really.....  I sure bet those perks will be a nice competitive advantage behind a paywall!!!!
Fortnite did it first 🤣
Now we need fnaf
Springtrap next 🤨
Awesome Chapter! Now we need a Terminator chapter with Kyle Reese or “The Stand” Chapter
DBD is great again it always have but it's even better!!!!
OMG BEHAVIOUR😍😍😍
Finally!!!!!
Omg no way
The only killer ive ever wanted
Yep ima be playing this & TCM
thats look amazing im in hype right now
It looks better than alien isolation
Que trailer lindo, que trailer perfeito, nossa parabéns
Congrats on the license, BHVR! Awesome trailer, excellent work. Can't wait to see them both in game. Are we getting a new map too? 🎉🎉🎉
Anyone else looking forward to running away from the xenomorph as Nicholas Cage?
Que hermosa noticia, además de que nos abre la puerta a nose.. Predator ? 😮 Hazlo realidad DBD
YOU DID IT!!!!!!!! A MASSIVE W, such a Horror staple in the best Horror mash up game! Thank you!!!
Dudddeeee they did so good on this design ! Awesome devs they deserve a raise for this one ! Pop the champagne 🍾
Bro was camping the hook
im just glad the cat is alright (I'm also very excited for this chapter)
Predator when ?
shut up and take my money!
I'm gonna love this update great job Devs!!
i wonder if alien can use like the twins power and relese a face hugger
That’s why BHVR is the goat! The goat!
Мы ждали этого 5... нет... 6 лет
LETSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO THIS COULD BE THE GREATEST DLC OF ALL TIME ! EXCELLENT WORK YASSSS
This looks so freakin’ cool! If they introduce the Predator in the future, my life is complete.
Very curious about what the abilities are
I've always wondered if they would add the Xenomorph, my wish is granted!
Y’all I just woke up and the first thing I did was grab my phone to watch this
Seriously why did it take so long? Were there some troubles with the license?
Yyyyyyyeeeeeeeessssss ❤❤❤❤❤
How about 6:30? She's with your game. Install. Bringing out content once you fix your game and make it funny in thin brain content.
It’s perfect pathos is is how I wanted it 😩
This is the reason I’m coming back to dbd. Ty
Big fan of alien. So im excited to see them take an apex predator and make it completely suck  TCM out august 18th for xbox, ps, steam
No eggs
DBD graphics are trash
Point hub
We need Jonesy as an Iri Add-on/Charm/SOMETHING!
Cool. Now we just need a Yautja (The Predator).
I’m really hoping the alien will be able to crawl in vents and surprise survivors working on gens. Also hoping the Mori will have to do with a facehugger, too.
I really hope when the Xenomorph is close by you hear the classic motion tracker beep. I don't they will do it  but it would be a nice surprise.
Men,  it's amazing
ITS GONNA BE AWESOME
Are we gonna get smoke blast thingies for stuns alongside pallets or something?
Ohh yea Predator will probably be next let's not kid ourselves.
No freaking way
Don’t do the Moro then look down it’s bugged
I get to play as a Xenoborph and america's hot aunt, Segourney Weaver's most notable role Ripley
Okay but Ripley ATE
They recreated the iconic xenomorph shot at 1:40
There are cats in the game?? Does that mean I can have pets possibly??? I would love that!
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAHH
Wait until Ripley discovers she's crashed on a planet with a bunch of random generators and pallets!
Too bad the Texas chainsaw game is about to overshadow this POS lol
Please  tell me we get a ellen ripley survivor!!!
That's awesome
Yeah, just what we needed, another broken killer, another helpless survivor... another middle finger to newbie survivors...
About damn time!
Yay another licensed killer and survivor i cant afford
terror radius better be the clicking noise
No thanks i don't wanna spill my beans
Always Dwight
I'm sure this is just for the trailer, but wouldn't it be cool if this was the first map with environmental hazards for the killer? both steam and pallets to be weary of along with maybe some hazards for survivors too?
Holy shit this is amazing....now watch it just be Demogorgon two...then again I'd love a second demodoggy, no matter what they do this is great
The 5th passeenger
No no no no no no no no no no no.. !!! 😝
No Sigourney Weaver as the face model???? DISAPPOINTED 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
as a killer I am so excited!
Oh yes Baby ❤❤❤❤❤
Never knew id ever see an alien chase someone around a small table with a pallet over and over until it hits them once only to do it again!
Ripleys back bitches
Beautiful
Anyone know if the ship will be added as a map?
So does this mean Predator could be a possible killer???
This might be one of the best chapters
this game would be so good if the graphics looked half as good as this😂
아이솔레이션에선 공포의 존재였으나 데바데에선 티배깅만 당할 예정...
let's welcome our newest guest's
Kinda seems like it might be like the demogorgon (possible a replacement since the licensing ran out) but will have new perks and anyone who has demo will get alien and will have basically the same power I might be completely wrong but I feel like the power will be similar nonetheless and I hope I'm wrong about it replacing demo because it holds a place in my heart even though I don't have it
Damn no new map?
I just hope it’s not a demigorgon clone
Probably the best dbd trailer theyve ever made oh my god, love this!
When the entire budget was spent on a stupid Cage and there was not enough money for a normal Ripley model.
Definitivamente revivieron el juego😎👌
Yeah but i hope that the alien cannot be stopped by a pallet that would be laughable
They finally fucking did it
Yea
Historical moment right here
This is AMAZING. By far the best trial. Can't wait
THIS IS GONNA BE ONE OF THE BEST CHAPTERS EVER HOLY
DBD been killing it lately ❤
When is this available outside of the ptb?
LETS GO I CAN FACECAMP WITH ALIEN
HOLY SHIT
Bhvr really are turning dbd into just a asymmetrical museum of gore and horror 😂 im all for it. This must have taken years to finally pull off, legit near the beginning of dbd
Just hope this map won't be another Hawkins situation
i have been WAITING for this
This is great now all we need is our stranger things back
Bro he vented I swear!
Awesome
it's fnaf anniversary today springtrap when (joke)
NO I WILL NOT BE TRICKED INTO PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN!!! NO!!!
Dead by Daylight is truly the Smash Bros of horror. I don't even like the game, I'm just curious what they can get away with. Like, what's next, Leshy from Inscryption?
I can't wait 😍🎉
It comes out the day I get unbanned from PlayStation😂
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
Dbd.. you need to give me a hug for this huge W🫂
Didn't think I'd see the day
If we can go in the Space Jockey ship ill actually freak out excited
an objectively perfect chapter im never playing any other killer again my main has arrived.
In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream
i was hoping they’d show a killer like trapper or legion with their chest bursted implying how f*cked up this alien is supposed to be
If the Alien gets a go in DbD, then it's only fair to have the Predator as a killer, too. Pretty please?
Ooooooooooooooh *_shit._*
When until dawn
I love that even Jonesy showed up in the trailer.
I heard el gato
Bruh😍(my dad loved the series so we grew up with it)
THIS IS SO AWESOME I’m definitely getting ripley
Finally this game does something worth paying for.
The demigorgon revisited
Found my new main for both survivor and killer in one sitting!
Sadly you didn't get Sigourney Weaver face.
❤🎉
Ellen looks so badarse. Can't wait to get this on Mobile after like a year or so hahaha
As usual, Dwight is on 🪝
For me this is easily the most hype thing they could have done.
they finally did it....
Even the cat is in the trailer, just love it <3
A stealth killer who can travel through tunnels?  Among us going real crazy
Another teleport killer?! Pls nooooooo!!!!
she does not look like Ellen Ripley tho, but im exited
Guess they didn't want to pay Sigourney Weaver for her likeness lol
Can't believe the cat will be a playable survivor
2 minutes of a game I don’t play got me more excited than 35 minutes of a franchise I do. This trailer is so sick!
I’ve been saying this for 3 years, and they finally answered my prayers 🤩❤️❤️
It wasn't programmed to harm the crew 2.0
I love it !! What a great idea!!!🥰🥰🥰😊😊😍😍😍😍
This is a great news, now there is only one thing missing...  PREDATOR
Those crazy SOBs actually did it
This is great! Now I have even more hope for a FNAF collab.
this is so freaking good omg.. jonesy!!!
She looks so gorgeous, aaaaah!
This still hasn’t come out yet? Man it takes them a long time to drop a single character with a walking animation
I hate how this is the closest thing we will have to an Alien Isolation Sequel for years and maybe ever.
you guys have the best colab so awesome crossing fingers for maybe a terminator one day can t wait for the new map too :3
Ok, but what about Jonesy. 😕
They really pulled out all the stops for this trailer huh? I can't wait to see how these two will work in the game!!
OMG we get Alien and Ripley in dbd??? It's like a dream came true!! The trailer was so cool!
Ripley is one of THE best final girls/ heroines is all cinema, gonna prestige 100 her
PREDATOR WHEN
YOOO WE GET RIPLEY LETS GOOOOOOOOO!
The alien can vent?! Amogus
Now, the real question.. Can I play the cat?
Everybody going crazy for the new chapter, but wouldn’t it be much better when we finally get a different gamemode? I mean seriously how can y’all not be bored of playing the same mode OVER & OVER & OVER again, it’s so repetitive after awhile, am I the only one who sees that??? Doesn’t seem like anyone cares about that
5 years too late
Cool, a lot of new bugs incoming. Im hyped 💪
This is the best thing to ever happen in my life. Wow that’s depressing.
The mori better have a face hugger
Real
springtrap would be cool too.İm not sayin xenomorph is bad i played fnaf and alien and  i love both.
HOLY SHIT THIS IS MY TYPE OF STUFF
Xenmorph
15k views and 15k likes. Glad the community is positive on this one
Ahem… YESSSS!!!!!!
Poor Dwigth
Demogorgon 3.0
Now we wait for the gameplay, I hope it doesn’t disappoint.
Another money is gone
Holy crap this is going to be epic its a dang time thanks dbd
arnold and predator next!
Please do The Predator with Arnold next 🙏 😢
Finally something as actually going to be scary and not promoting that rainbow crap
You got to be kidding me. WHERE. IS. THE FNAF CHAPTER????
alien is cool, but..... WHERES MY AFTON >:(
Next Predator
IT CAN VENT 🥺 yes!
Is that Ripley?
Finally they can stop crying
Chasing killer? but hol up, NO NEW MAP !!!! THATS COOL MAP IN THE TRAILER I WANT IT!!!!!!!
I'm not in hype. I AM THE HYPE
Been waiting for this since beta started
So no Predator?
Yes!!!
Vamos ahora solo falta ver a Predator para que sea más épico!
Ptb when?
is that supposed to be Sigourney Weaver?
Hell yeah; glad to see a proper trailer! Great job devs, you're stepping up your game like you should be! This looks sick, both from killer and survivor. Can't wait to know the new perks...hope there's a map too!
Llega Masacre de Texas, pónganse las pilas a reparar el juego y balancearlo 😉 igualmente jugaré un poco aquí y allá y veré cuále entretiene más, aunque por como está el juego actualmente ya creo sé dónde estare mejor 😂
That chase music is going to be fire.
Мы дожили до этого...
Finally, some good food.
HUGE W!!!!
Just add Predator and Jason and we’ll have all of the Mortal Kombat X guest characters in DBD
Next ones gotta be Nicole from Dead Space with Isaac Clark. I would drop money for that.
Banger !!
Any new gameplay features or mechanics? Or just more of the same?
Nice one  Still not spending a cent till Freddy Fazbear
I wonder if we get something new like the pull down smoke thing she did 😭
is the alien character will blind?
Yes king
hey i think that might be an alien
So...why the skull merchant then
Dead by Daylight Alien
I was hoping they add a different survivor as Ellen riply could kick most of the killers arses to the curb
Bro can u tell dbd movile to hurry up with this update bro game is trash rn
WELP TIME TO REDOWNLOAD THIS GAME
So it's not a re-skin for demo them, cool.
So the Entity took the cat too? -Cat survivor confirmed-
Another trailer, another dwight getting merked for no reason. Stop doing my boy like this
this is going to be fun
Ok cool new chapter but no map?
Why does the wait feel so long this time around
If the map is on the ship I’m gonna lose my mind
Wait... its a demogorgon 2.0?
Might actually consider re installing now.
Predators next please🤓
I hope the map is like hawkins. I miss it sm
i heard the movies were great from a family member i want to check it out now! dbd is growing server which is good
They actually listened to the community and put it in the game
Wait, that’s suppose to be Riley? Didn’t even look like her.
Wow. Ripley is here, dbd just got exciting again. This will be an amazing long awaited addition🎉
YOOOOO!!!! THIS IS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just get it while the license last.😂
I'm still waiting for THE SHINING to be a DLC
too late, game is dead
You got my attention.
Stop!! I refuse to come back damn it!!
She was looping alien
it looks so epic I can't wait to being blasted with a pallet.
QUE PUTA GUAPADA CHAVAL
I really hope they get Sigourney Weaver to voice her!
All that's missing now is Predator as a killer and Arnold as a survivor and this game is a 10/10
I wonder if, to coincide with the movie, they’ll release a FNAF collab?
Holy shit this is real!!!
Let us pet the cat or we riot
I hope one of its special abilities is traversing through the map using underground vents or something
aaaaaaammmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiii <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 S2 S2 te amo bhvr
Watching alien was one of my favourite movies, so I’m happy about them adding it into my favourite games aswell
Can y’all like FIX YOUR OLD WEAK CHARACTERS instead of introducing newer ones?!?
Skull Merchant is gonna get a Predator outfit I'M CALLING IT
been wanting this since mikey got released
As an alien isolation enthusiast i feel like crying with happiness
YES!!!!!!!!!!
This is awesome!
Is the cat ok? If the cat isn’t ok we’re breaking up
Best trailer ever
A xenomorph done right for once
Yo, this dog be taking something
someone get Maximilian to play this game now just for Alien since he loves that franchise alot
All thats left other than balancing the game is to add gore tech and better voice acting to really sell the mori animations Because christ even with these neat additions and higher budget it still looks not great in game
I hope the standalone killer at the end of the year is the Predator. Would be cool to like, connect this trailer with his.  When the Xenomorph pounces the Predator appears and cut his head off or something.

RIPLEYYYY
Not bad releasing it alittle after Texas chainsaw massacre. Competition is good since they haven't had any since Friday the 13th game was murdered in its sleep. Looks like they stepped up their game, cant wait to see it.
Next crossover: The Evil Within featuring Ruvik, The Keeper or The Guardian as the new killer. Sebastian, Juli Kidman and Joseph Oda as the new survivors.
I miss the narrators voice though 😔
I thought they would forget about this fantastic sci-fi series, one of 70' - 80' greatest horror.
Holy shit, I thought it'd never be done.
NO WAY HELL YEAH
friendly reminder that FNAF will NEVER be in DBD
Banger of a trailer. But…will there be a new map? I pray that there will be
Same game with a new coat of paint.
an assassin i always wanted because i love *_alien vs predator movies_*
YESSSS Thank you DBD
Can we get Freddy faznuts now?
I'm so excited I really want to play with them and see how it is but İf only I had auric shells I'm poor😢
This is gonna be so good, I’m a big alien fan and my goal is to now prestige xenomorph to 100.
I have been waiting YESSSSSS finally xD
YESSS
Are we gonna get traps in the new map?
GIVE THEM VOICE LINES PLEASE I'M BEGGING YALL THE VOICE LINES PLEASE BRO
Best dlc ever
rep xenomorph 1:00 insidious camping dwight.
wow
In the immortal words of Sonic the hedgehog. " AW YEAH THIS IS HAPPENING!"
Hoping not another boring m1 killer, but this is very sick though. I liking it
these are skins from fortnite
Im so excited omg
Я КУПЛЮ ЭТО ,Я КУПЛЮ ЭТО
Whoa!!😳😳😳🔥🔥🔥
Safe to say the Predator is coming after both Alien and the survivors?
Woah. The alien is coming out on my birthday.
This is one of the best trailers for DBD done in awhile
a weird decision to drop this update so soon after fromsoft's armored core 6 is coming out,  nobody I know is gonna have time for anything but mechs mechs mechs and the MH:sunbreak title update for a while.  probably coulda released it now and got more sales while people are waiting for their new stuff.
Demogorgon reskin confirmed
Hawkins national laboratory 2.0
I normally don’t speak for the community but I do feel confident in saying this for everyone: LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I do like it. But dont just ignore the horrible state the game curretly is in. Even as much as i love the xenomorph id rather hace the game fixed first.
But is there a map? ?
I'm still waiting for Chucky...
Ma davvero gli uncini -.- L'alien deve appendere i sopravvissuti? non potevate escogitare qualcosa di diverso che si congegna con l'alien tipo un sistema di uova a 3 stadi come gli uncini.?
Wait, no gameplay 😔 love this so much 😎👌👏
Imagine if the nostromo map has a win condition to get a working power suit and hunt the killer down
Definitely looking forward to this. I’m predicting some stealth and pounce mechanics.
Fix solo que
Hmmm…
I haven't seen anyone talking about Ripley activating the steam to stop the Xenomorph. This could mean we'll be getting unique props to stop the killer in each map to replace the pallets.
Jipers creepers next
when i was small i always wanted the alien to come to dbd guess you guys gon eat my money yet again this year
Now we needed is Fnaf: Springtrap and Michael.
Comming end of summer?
Yeah there trying so hard to stay relevant because Texas chainsaw massacre releases soon and this games gonna lose like 25-50% it’s playerbase. This game is bad only reason it has players is there’s not really other competition in the space
1:38 damn that's a good shot.
ELLEN IS BACK!!! AND JONESY!!!
*That’s what I’m talking about!*
I have expected Ripley to punch the xeno right it's face.
I don't play this game but I'm surprised Alien is only just releasing now...
Finally!
The Fear Entity's army of nightmares continues to grow, I see.
if this killer ends up being super map dependent im going to be so pissed
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD !!!
the Demogorgon left so The Xenomorph can enter.
Finally, they did a pretty good job so far…
arrepio até os pelo do butico rapai
I’m jus as excited for this but just watch alien be a better knight or onryo type character lmao😊
No way..
Kinda bummed Ellen doesn't really look like Weaver but it still looks great
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOO
Now for the Predators to join in on the nightmare
THE CAT 😭😭😭😭
Finally a good reason to download this game again
BHVR steppin up! Love it
I cannot wait for this chapter to come in DBD
Menos mal pagaron una licencia y no se inventaron sus propios killers bien plagiados jaja
im so excited
I cannot explain how excited i am
Опять Дуайт страдает
Way better than Alien Isolation!
Cool. Delete Nicholas cage now please
Cool. Delete Nicholas cage now please
killer will be blind? or not
They did it again...
I see that BHVR, due to the lack of ideas of which licensed character to bring out in the game, somehow copies the fan-made of Rarithlynx.  I only see my opinion, since in the Rarithlynx channel, he has many concepts for future DBD dlc's.  New dlc with more problems within the game file, crashes and other things, I hope they look and fix their game.
I really hope the aliens terror radius, if it has one, is the motion tracker sound from the movies.
Put Jason in game already
I feel like playing Alien Isolation
Cant wait to see how survivors bitch about this one!
Take my money
It would be really cool to see them ad predator too hence the movie, curious to know his abilities too
The only thing we need is Jason voorhes and you know it..
Predator next please 🙏
it wasn’t meant to harm the crew 😢
I mean we only saw the new survivor for like 5 seconds, but I am interested to see how playing a cat will effect gameplay.
I’m getting that DLC so fast. Take my money 😂
A Ripley who looks nothing like Ripley, perfect
This could've been better implimented.  As a killer, start as a face-hugger. Try and infect as many survivors as you can. Face hugger turns into Alien when first survivor's timer runs out.
did they not get the rights to Sigourney Weaver's likeness?
So he'll be able to teleport for sure somehow...
😍
Survivors can activate traps now!?
No. Way. They....did it.... So awesome!
It looks amazing! Thank you BHVR! 😁
This is going to be perfect, outdone yourselves this time!!
Is this an attempt to revive this game or just a cash grab for the remaining players?
It's a beautiful day boys, just imagine baby Dwight hiding from Alien🥲
Non we need the Prédator
PLEEEAAAAASEEEE BEHAVIOR GIVE RIPLEY VOICE LINESSSS YOU GOTTA DO IT MAN!!!!
She just left Dwight behind
Je n'ai jamais été autant hypé par un DLC ! Ça à vraiment intérêt d'être bien niveau gameplay !
Hell yes
Now put Brendan Fraser and the mummy
All I can say is this....YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sorry Gabe and Meatball AI, you've now been outshined.
Где чужой там и хищник. Если чужого будут кошмарить фонариком, на который ему плевать если что. Игра заслуженно будет названа говном года
I'm hard 😈📸
Might buy this
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this has been my dream license so I am SO EXCITED to see this!!!!! MORE MONSTROUS KILLERS WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Vent
woah
This is inspiring
Wow! And it isn't April Fool's? Hell yeah!
Next we need Freddy fazbear
No new map? Lazy asses
Dwight randomly in the Alien movie lol
🔥🔥
I swear if its gonna be a Demogorgon 2.0 Im gonna be disssapointed
So excited!!!!
My boy just wants a pet, give him a handful.
bro
Speaking from personal (gaming) experience, the alien would rip the "survivors" to shreds in maybe 1 minute if he's lazy.
i want that map too!! D:
no way they did it
dont fuck it up please
Neat
I think I speak for all of us when I say IT’S ABOUT DAMN TIME! 😂
Ya gotta admit, Dead By Daylight does pretty darn good fan service
The Evil Within
So no new map? I was so excited for the Nostromo but great chapter nonetheless
I will main these two if it’s the last thing I do😅
and then Ellen Ripley pulls out Slurp Juice and a legendary tac shotgun
Thank you
Kind of wild how far this game has come.
i’m actually super excited for this 🎉🎉🎉
Wow, the strongest alliance between the company and the movie is special
Does anyone think Ellen will have the same line as in the movie yknow  "Get away from her you BITCH"
❤
Yes, ELLEN!
THE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!
NICEEEEEW
Alien is overrated, they can only hunt unarmed weak humans. Once they face a well armed war veteran human or some species like Predator, they will be fooked up
From the distance of any map now Imma be like 👁️ 👄 👁️ I see this 7-8 ft tall alien someone help ! 😭😂
ALRIGHT WE GOT THE THING!!! .... so what now?
i feel like Xenomorphs would give crazy head ngl
Bro this game gotta stop tacking my money
The alien is dope and I can’t wait to play as Ridley
YESSSS FINALLYYY
Watch the alien not be good tho lol I can see that
Thanks dbd literally ON MY BIRTH DAY 🎂 🍰 🎉
That is super awesome!
Every forum you guys put out. I always choose to say xenomorph always!!! Can’t wait. Thank you BHVR ! Thank you <3
Ah so we might be getting a demigorgon type with tunnels
Sigourney?
Now every Legion main can reveal the truth: we were all just training for this moment.
What an absolutely amazing trailer, can't wait to see how badly they fuck it up in game.
Shi😢
I thought I wouldnt see em making a good chapter in this life. I was never so happy that I was mistaking lmao
Plot twist: The cat is going to be the new killer
O Oooo my xeno baby
We're getting both the Xenomorph AND Ellen Ripley!? 😭
Hubiera estado mejor que la teniente Ripley este sin el cabello, pero aún así está bueno 😃 🎉🎉
All I know is this killer better not be able to spawn in no gay ass teammate help
Anything I've ever said negative about you i take it all back!
most amnautakam trailer yet
I got chills. This is gonna be sick
Awesome!
As a guy who loves the horror genre, this brings tears to my eyes. This really hype's me up for this. Hat's off to BHVR for this. It may not be an homage to Sigourney Weaver (Ellen Ripley), sure as hell she wont be forgotten.
YES
the chase music omg
The tongue has to be the mori. I'd be cool if it smashes pallets and walls with the tail.
Best trailer made in 6 years.... Great work devs
What the MORI will be interesting
I am just happy like a child in Disneyland. I love Alien movies and I love to see such DLC in DbD
I have not played DBD in three years, but this might change it.
FINALLLYYYY THIS IS MY COMEBACK TO DBD
Ellen Ripley but not Sigourney weaver little dissapointing on this point, waiting gameplay
Can't wait to have it.
Yessir🔥🔥🔥
I wanna boop the snoot alien
Absolutely Amazing!! And worth the wait!!
Its the guy from fortnite!
I am very excited!!! :D
Even if its bad, I'll buy it so I have the best killer model.
Clearly didn't get Sigourney Weavers likeness. Lol
IM SO EXCIGED
Is his ability gonna be like demorgorgons? that would be awesome!
She looks hot. The human looks nice too
Yup, that’s a xenomorph.
Welcome Alien 😀
Almost thought it was fake
Ok, that was the most wanted killer in DbD for everyone, and we finally got it. But whom we will be asking to add for the next few years? Jason Voorhees?
Take my money
poggers
Awesome trailer!
Haha, they didn't get the rights to "Sigourney Weaver", now we got an awful Ripley from wish and the trailer shows the Alien being fast like in the movies when ingame it's propably gonna walk slow af like almost every other killer. And what's the point even? They gonna lose the rights to it like with "Stranger Things" at some point anyways, then the map, the survivor and the killer gets removed from the game.
Holy crap, that was actually a horror/scary clip! Usually these things are cheesy. This was serious! So hyped!
Holy shit... I'm not even into Alien but the fact that it wasn't leaked?!  DAMN! 😮  Hope y'all have fun though, does look kinda cool.
mori alien is make you pregnant?
Haven't seen original in so long. Does that look like Ellen Ripley?
You get a like for Jonesy.
I think this is the absolute best trailer they’ve ever made!
Finally! Awesome job!!!
It still won't make this game good.
I really hope this takes off and they next cover 'Predator'..
Looks fucking great
Чужой, вперед!
The Predator or Terminator would be a nice addition
a blind killer?
Gotta get Sigourney Weaver likeness for Ripley. It feels wrong otherwise.
@DeadByDaylight  This is a great addition to the game... I dare say this is a Massive W for dbd... But like, you also need to reach out to "Red Barrel" for an OUTLAST chapter, Trust me you won't regret it.
Очередной демогоргон перемещающийся по норам?
I'm byuing the chapter blind folder idc
Bruh what? Ripley looks like ass, nothing like Sigourney
hmm, so is the power to swap between the different Xenomorph biologies? cause we have the Human Morph, and then the on all fours Dog Morph from 3...
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Good job
Oh hell yes dude
HONESTLY INSANE 🔥
FINALLY
This is where the fun begins
Alright, how they gonna fuck up this time
Ptb is today for all you pc players 😂
Funny thing is, not to long ago i saw fan video in recommendations that he Will be New killer D
The Predator next please!
Omg we all need this chapter❤❤
ELLEN RIPLEY LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!
They'll have to do the Predator now. 😃
This game is soo redundant and almost impossible to win as a survivor
and then we wake up
it's really something really worth to wait
I actually thought that the xenomorph would be a survivor💀
Couldn't have been a better killer choice in my opinion, very curious about the abilitie(s) and perks our Alien wil have.
It awsome, the greatest have come
WANT NOW
Ripley, my girl
Why not call it the Xenomorph?
Been waiting years for this moment! Can't wait to see powers and perks!
1:02. "Stop! Not so fast yall! Ya think you can just up and unhook? ya crazeh!"    1:05 "I like to eat you with my little mouth too!"
THE MORI !!!
best killer ever made to this game
Great work BHVR, amazing trailer!!!!!
I mean that’s what i call a teaser bruh but why did they have to do ripley that ugly????
Other chapters I'm hoping for are  The Evil Within chapter  Killer - The Keeper  Survivor - Sebastian Castellanos, Julie Kidman  Map - Beacon Mental Hospital  The Candyman chapter  Killer - The Candyman  Friday The 13th chapter  Killer - The Undead (Jason Voorhees)  Map - Camp Crystal Lake
It's Already Legend👽
Springtrap next please
Kitty
Nostromo is BACK!!!
Puppy
I am pretty excited for this event!
Im not only excited just for The Alien, but what this means for the future. If they got THE license I honestly thought impossible, what else can we see that we gave up on in the past?
It doesn’t look like her at all I’m so mad
meh,mid
We need Weaver to voice the survivor!!!!!!!
damn she a baddie
finally the alien, i love alien, i never thought i would come back to the game, but now i need it
Pretty good perks so far,keep ruining killer gameplay,great devs fr
Best dlc since Albert Wesker!
LETS GOOO. WE ALL HERE FOR THE NEW DBD SEASON.
We already knew the alien was coming from last trailer… sorta was hoping for perks and survivor perks… but it was cool to watch
This is amaaaazing❤❤❤just missing his bro the "predator"
I love alien can’t wait for this to come out
FINALLY!
Ceiling crawling 😮 oh yes
Imagine waking up from cryo sleep and the first thing you see a Dwight being hooked. 😂😅😂
HELLLLLL YEAAAAAA
Bro we will all agree bhvr made masterpeace of all time man when we remember only start with dbd and look now what they actually made we can say bro deapest congratulations for every dude in comunity W dbd W bhvr W trailer W everthingg lett s goo broo
We want the next killer to be Slanderman 🔥
sensacionalll!!!
colonial marines cosmetic?
When will the fnaf be?
The Alien needs the power to travel around the map through tunnels similar to Demo
YIPPIEEE
Aw yeah I can't wait to throw pallets down and repair gens again just with new skins
WOW.
I was so hyped.. Now I'm extremely sad that you didn't get the likeness for her..
Can't wait to see it get t-bags, flashlights, genrush and some nerfs after the release hype
I mean this game is the best horror crossover ever and I love that but the main gamemode is outdated and uninspired. Yaaaa new killer, survivor and new perks but then you go back to doing the same thing of fixing gens...  But people are simple. You give em something branded and they'll throw money at you to do the same thing they have been doing for years with a little new flavor on top.
So.. my childhood fear finally here.. Thats will be interesting
lets hope they dont fuck it up
omg alinen
Poor Dwight always getting it in these trailers lmao
Mi hype iva subiendo hasta que vi que la survi no es ellen ripley.... encerio van hacer como hicieron con lory la hermana de miyers?...
Just watching this gave me Alien: Isolation PTSD flashbacks. This is gonna be freaking awesome.
RIPPLEY !!!!!! 😆😆😆😆
They didn't afford to bring Sigourney Weaver liking to the game?
DbD developers: We wanted to expand the game by adding sci-fi in the world.   The Sci-Fi: Here's an OC and a guest.
ooo maybe that gas is a new mechanic to stun the killer??
i hope we get another demogorgon inside map with this i loved that map so much haha
So he must have some sort of sneak teleport ability, looks dope
Too bad the xenomorph is gonna look dumpy af on the regular maps and totally out of place.
Her face is abit off, doesnt look like Ripley. But hyped!!
W
It would be cool if the map had that smoke sprinkler thing seen in the trailer, as an actual tool in the game that survivors can use to blind killers or maybe even disorient them while at it.
This is the dlc i needed to start this game
I’m excited
Fair play they smashed it out the park with this chapter!
About time
Something better than stranger things finally
still waiting for springtrap
The killer was face camping, BHVR knows their community so well.
I love they focus on surviving
We could get predator to now because of this
It's game over, man! Game over!
As always it's easy to think about what killers could be next but what's hard is to come up with unique power for the killer....I can't imagine what could it be for Alien...
This confirms to me that they lost the predator/prey license at the last minute and that's why we have the skull merchant
OH MY GOD LETS GO
YES RIPLEY IS BACK BABY
Now that we got Alien in this game, we gotta get Predator into this game
I have a poster of Ripley in my room because she is such a heart throb from the 80s, and even though Sigourney Weaver who played Ripley is 73 she is still smoking hot
Bro what was the point in posting this and the teaser. Shoulda shown gameplay after the first trailer u showed this tells me nothing and doesn’t get me hype at all.
Bra... Fucking... Vo.... Excellent Trailer!
I now know for sure that skull merchant was just a shitty predator replacement lol.
If the mori doesn't involve a face hugger then y'all messed up.
it's honestly about damn time
so, it can go through vents, can't see and plant eggs on survivors?
Just read the patches and I cannot wait for the actual game footage!
Bro that survivor looks like my teacher
Why does this have likes
Based
They trailers are getting better and better they actually take time to build up tension and show off the survivor and killer. Well done
Now we just need predator
I hope it's a good one. If they go 0/4 with 4 killers in a row, that's death knell territory.
About damn time!!!!
Oh god it’s in the vents! ITS IN THE VENTS!!!
Lets gooooooo
Two Si-Fi chapters back to back is crazy. And one of them is ALIEN!!!!
dead by daylight: amogus
They cooked with this chapter
yess hype! looks amazing so far
Dang
Nic Cage and Alien?! Keep up the streak Bhvr!
[Some dude Leaks Nasa Alien Documents] : Dead By Daylight be like, let's Make this a Chapter 😂
It appears the Xenomorph will rely on sound, as we saw it kind of got distracted by the random noise, giving Ellen a chance to run. Survivors might need to stand still or hold their breaths to hide from it, like on Alien Isolation.
Guys! Don't praise BHVR yet! We still don't know the gameplay!
FINALLY
I feel so happy. Dbd just keeps getting better this year man
yeeeees
WOW. Im just getting back into DBD this week and already a new killer that Ive been wanting for yeaaars. This is amazing.
What is the ability of a xenomorph?
The cat is back
Why they got dis big head ahh nigga in here
Bro expectations vs reality will hit hard on this one
I JUST CREAMED
That does not look like Ripley
Dude there was a concept character trailer and it looked eerily similar to this and that was 4 or 3 years ago and it had a crashed ship in the background like this one , which means it really wasnt clickbait!
It's game over, man! GAME OVER!
WHAT OMGG
Will save up my blood points for this
Super hyped! Especially since this comes out on 8/29, my birthday!
I can't wait for the Alien chapter, I'm so excited!! My uncle was a notorious organ harvester that tried to surgically remove my kidneys in a dark alleyway and almost got away with it
IM ABT TO BE THE BIGGEST XENO MAIN GODDDDDD IM SO EXCITED 😭😭😭😭
Ellen Ripley looks like a little older Version of Nancy Wheeler..or older sister.
I have all killers except Demogorgon
Cat is the new survivor?????
1:39 love how the recreate the shot of the alien in the vents in the original film :D
LESS GO
Finally space ship map
not sure how they will implement the killer lol
Feels like I’m playing in the actual movie
omg
LETS GOOOO
JONESEY SURVIVOR CONFIRMED
W
Soundbased killer?
So....vent system?
i hope alien have blind like a movie, more speed but dont see anything just feel and hear survival
Maybe the cat is a perk 🤔
DBD has really upped their game 2023, hell yeah! Haven’t been this excited since Albert Wesker & The Dredge
Nancy has been places, damn
Is this the concept trailer 😂
Can't wait to main Ripley, this is definitely a W for behavior!
omg my favorite movie ever is coming to dbd
YES!!!! Im so excited for this!! I hope Jonsey works kinda like the crows and also hope the steam works like how the pallets work
Aye she could’ve gone for the save
The Xenomorph is merely prey for a more, tactical killer. One that which detects heat signatures and has a whole arsenal at its disposal.
Looks like one of the best chapters in DBD. There are Halloween Chapter vibes
Чужой, уже страшно
I wonder if bursting the pipes to stun killers ends up being a new game mechanic on this map
any ideas what the killer powers gonna be? looks like good mobility is gonna be a part of it.
can we please add chucky
W
I hope we can see the cat running around the ship 😅 That would be awesome😇
Das ist scheiße Portal  Warum Eier ?????????????????????????????????? Warum nicht Eier Facehugger
NOT DWIGHT AGAIN POOR BEAN But AMAZING work
Haven't been this excited since Wesker came into the game
I’ve been waiting for this since i started playing dead by daylight I hope this chapter isn’t another skull merchant 🗿
Imagine if A Yautja(predator) was the survivor
I can't wait for the perks of those 2
I am so freaking hype for this
I recommend everyone who hasn’t played it already to play “Alien Isolation” in anticipation to this!  That game is an underrated masterpiece!
this looks… amazing.  And it releases on the same day I’ll be at 1000 subs wow
this looks… amazing.  And it releases on the same day I’ll be at 1000 subs wow
If the cat is not on the map I will be sad
Might download again
this looks so good!!! nice job bhvr
Amazing splendid job Behavior!
so whats the power? teleportation? is that steam element going to be in the game?
While chasing she pulls something that drops smoke could it be a new thing to help in chases?
LETS GOOOOOOOO FINALLY!!! MY FAVORITE MONSTER IN DBD!!!!!
Dead by daylight beautiful job
So I'm guessing his power is using vents or little xenomorph tunnels?
I guess they couldn’t get weavers face likeness
Holy shit this is definitely the best animated trailer they have put out, so energetic and I love to see actual looping instead of just the characters looking around
Boys wanted Fnaf, men wanted Alien
OH OH OUTDOOR MAP? OE AT LEAST HYBRID
At long last, my life long dream of having Nicholas Cage vs the Alien has come true.
That cat better be a playable character or I'm uninstalling.
WELL DONE BEHAVIOUR!!!!
No new map?
Quite based
I feel like it’s going to be perennially hilarious watching the Perfect Killing Machine get thwarted by a wooden palette on the other maps.
I'm worried that the Xenomorph will turn out to be a Demo clone in gameplay
Was really disappointed with this BBQ event, but from this trailer I hope this chapter is the reason why.
And it’s come out on my birthday
UNTIL AUGUST 29?😭 BRO I CAN'T WAIT😭 SO MUCH DAYS LEFT
*DOPE!*
huge win for dbd! can't wait for this! now we just need chucky 😸
“You did it…you crazy son of a b!tch you actually did it”  - Dr. Ian Malcolm
cant wait to struggle blinding him because of the lack of eyes  Amazing job tho
YES! FINALLY!!
look forward to Alien.exe from JRM
So excited! It's like my chest is about to explode!
another teleport killer i reckon lmao
Wow, they did the same thing with Ripley that they did with Laurie couldn’t even get Sigourney Weaver and she even help direct the first one
When you think about it, if Alien and Ripley in dbd...then Predator and Dutch have to happen. Regardless of what anyone says.  Make it happen Behavior. No more bs.
ELLEN RIPLEY MEU DEUS AAAAAAAAAAAA
Looks like I’ll be spending my 500 auric cells on this little bugger
MEU SONHO SE REALIZOUUU
Hello, when playing for a huntress with a wild board skin, the screen is blocked by textures that should not be visible
Sisi muy pulento y todo pero.... El gato está bien?
Brooooo is about fucking time yooo let's goooooo 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 another of the OG horror killers from my childhood now we're missing Chucky from child's play
Demogorgon remake I knew it
The hype is real
Mother Vs Mother
What if this is just gonna be demo
i am living for the new sci fi releases, DBD has lacked sci fi horror for so long.
It's about time they get more sci-fi horror characters.
Please don't make it into a Demogorgon skin
EU TO CHOCADO
could have been so much better if its Siguorney Weaver's likeness.. but still 🔥🔥
Woah, thanks for getting all my good sides.
When the impostor is sus
i'm creaming😭
awesome but wheres springtrap
JONESY!!
Imagine if they added me to dbd
I am a ripley main
Omg looks like it’s gonna go through vents ahhh
I'm most surprised that the Xenomorph would follow the Entities rules and restrictions. Maybe we will get something like Myers where she can just ignore the Entity sacrifice and just kill any survivor.
Now get a UNSC marine and the flood as characters
PTB already downloaded. Let's fricken goooooo
I'm very hyped for this chapter but I'm not really sure about how Ripley looks...like she doesn't look a bit like Sigourney :(
WE GOY ALIEN WO
Ripley and Jones!!!
I love the Xenomorph design they chose! A cross between the classis Xenomorph from the first film, and the "dog alien" from Alien 3. Pretty perfect in my eyes, and my hype is through the roof!
Ripley looks a bit off. My guess is they didn’t have permission to get the likeness of her actress because I second guessed for a second whether that was actually Ripley.
Dude, no way are we getting Ripley, and a new map as well
this game sum ass
Ptb when
EPPPIIIICCCCC .. WISH THE ALIEN SEES AS SONAR .. .. EEEEEPPPPIIICCCC 😍😍😍😍😍 MAKE IT LAY EGGS .. SO ON GENS IT WOULD BE LIKE THE TWINS AND THEY STRUGGLE SO THE CREATURE NOT GET IN ... BUT IF IT DO MORI LIKE DEATH AFTER SOME TIME .. EEEPPIIICCC
Bread 🍞
in the wise words of the great AfroSenju XL:   I JUST NUTTED EVERYWHERE!   but also why is it always poor dwight who gets caught in these trailers...
Have finishing moves in the console version!!
HOLY SH**🔥🔥🔥🙌🙌🙌🙌👾
Looks great.
We knew what it was and they just got into it holy hell.
LETSS FUCKING GOOOO 👏👏
Bro he was camping the Dwight baby killer smh
can we play as the cat?
Damn I can’t wait to play as the cat
More cash to spend 😊
*deeeeep breath*.....YAEAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHH FINALLY!!!!!!
When xeno tries to eat my teammate:  GET AWAY FROM HER YOU B*TCH!
When will the PTB come out?
판자로 흠씬 두들겨 패주지✋️💢🔪🔪🔪🔪
Now all we need is the 20th Century Fox charm so that we can put it on our killers in the game
awesome!!! cant wait!!!! it seem to hv new map
Wonder if its ability will include hearing survivors but not seeing them like scp 939 in scpsl
hell yeaaaaaah!!!
Okay that chase theme is EVERYTHING
I'm so stoked for Ripley!
Yay meg didn't get picked on for once
So no new map?
trailer looks insane, i hope they get everything right with xenomorphs power and both xenomorphs and ripleys perks aswell. this has the potential to bring loads of players back to the game.
"It's Game Over Man!"
Where is the Hunter?
I'm so excited I can't wait!
Now we need The Predator so it’s a fair balance of killers
YYYAYAYAYYAY!!!!!!!!!
YES! YES ! YES! YES! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!
As an Alien fan, i couldn’t be more happy
YES
cool
I like how dwight is just used to it now he didnt scream being put on a hook and he hangs off it like its another tuesday
The mad lads actually did it
Does anyone eles want to pet the alien?
Best chapter of the year, but ut looks like the demogorgon please i can run on walls
Best dbd trailer ever
I beg that Alien won't have a teleport power, seems like the trailer hints towards that being the case tho.
Looking forward, this looks promising!
The Alien was literally camping DwightXDD
it was programmed to harm the crew
Damn im excited now!Love the new futuristic chapters were getting!
FINALLY 😭😭😭
Yeah he definitely looks like a more faster and stronger Demogorgon but I’m here for it and looks like he has a leap attack as well I can’t wait as a killer main to play the Xenomorph
best trailer so far
Didn’t think this day would actually come
It's game over man
Apesar do rosto nao parecer tanto com a atriz, ficou top, e o mapa vai ser bem estilo halkins
We need PREDATOR!
So whens gotta be the ptb?
I THOUGHT I WAS DONE!  DBD anniversary got me all the BP I needed… then they drop THIS!  This is one of the last remaining big movie IPs they don’t have!  And technically the last one if you’re satisfied with F13 and Predator the game.  The only IPs remaining are “modern” like the new Pennywise and FNAF/Slender.
The trailer also shows something else xenomorph are blind confirmed
WOOOWWWWW
Yooo they actually got Ripley!!! Pls add a legendary skin for dallas
It feels weird looking at dwight hanged in a foreign spaceship 😂😅
ITS GAMEOVER MAN ! GAME OVER!
Yess !! I CANT WAIT !!
New surv already know how to loop it while dwight got hooked immediately 💀💀💀
Did i just see him run on the wall? at 1:23
Bhvr when trying to make you hype for original characters: 😐  Bhvr when they get a license: 😎
aint no way bro was camping with insidious
this is going to be the best dlc for dead by daylight
😮 are they gonna implement in map mechanics apart from pallets. The gas that can stall killer but give them the blood thirsty speed afterwards 😮😮😮
We better be playin on a new map this chapter or else I ain't sticking for long
So for sure it’s a vent ability which is going to be amazing. Along with a leap ability in addition.   Ripley I assume will have an ability to cause a failed check of some sort or a distraction in another location (potentially with the cat) as part of her kit.   Map specific interactions for survivors to blast it with steam as well for another form of hinderance for the alien/killers to hamper the long chases of corridors. I’d guess it’s long corridors given the multiple vaults and interactions to help escape the killer with a side passage or two so it’s not all fully straight.
Words can’t express how happy this makes me
Yay!!! I’m actually crying 😭 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
So fucking hyped
Just saying, if that ain't Ms. Weaver voicing Ripley it'll be cool yes but missing that "umf" you know? However Xenomorphs aside, now where's the Predator hmm?
One our second map from outer space two our third alien killer character and third one the best chapters
If it will be half as good as on the trailer Ill be flabbergasted
Crlh maluco q foda
LETS FUCKING GO. I CAN RELIVE MY CHILDHOOD
Not bad
THIS IS GONNA BE INSANE 🎉
Outstanding! Next a Supernatural DLC with Sam and Dean as survivors, please!!
Finally something good they added about time
Can't wait for spooky loopz make a video with these people 😊
This doesn't look like Sigourney Weaver sadly, maybe a skin in the store to correct this problem  ? Still a huge fan of this franchise though so bringing it into DbD is really a huge step forward.
It's finally here!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
THIS IS AWESOME
NO WAY
Somebody slap the shit outta me, this can't be real, this must be a dream
Yay
I thought there was a new map this chapter aswell but it only says new killer and survivor??? Anyways they both look amazing 10/10 can’t wait
Well I’ll be damned never thought The Alien would appear in this game
Wait a second... no new map? Sad.
This is definitely gonna be my top favorite crossover D.B.D. has ever done.
THE DLC OF THE YEAR
Finalmente uma dlc boa, to desdo começo do ano esperando isso
You know what would be better to add. Predator
Bet. It's going to be demos power.
Oooh nice, always hoped on Alien killer.
As much as I love the cinematic ITS SO FUNNY KNOWING THE ALIEN HAS TO HOOK PEOPLE LOL
APPRECIATE THE MUSIC, ITS EXTROARDINARY JESUS
no springtrap ? :(
My theory for the mori is gonna have something to do with the Face hugger
❤❤❤❤
I hope Jonesy the cat is also part of the DLC in some capacity 😄
Holy
Nancy 2.0
thats insaaaannnneee, it's giving me the same anxiety of when stranger things first came out
guys why dbd is scary
ok so power : teleport to vent who are put in map at start of the game like sadako and a jump/dash
I wonder if they were able to get Weaver's likeness for this. It looks like her.... but not quite
Omg this looks so good
damn right i'm getting this when it comes out. that's my favorite horror movies/game
Impossible...
Now they will finally need to add springtrap from fnaf
Alien still only has isolation as the only good game it’s been in
ITS OUR BOY! JONESY!
That ain't  RIPLEY . THAT IS reply
My god i love it ❤😢
Looks like they couldn’t get Sigourney Weaver’s likeness. 😢 Everything else looks amazing though!!
Can the cat be part of her lobby animation!?
made me ceram
Cant believe its actually happening, huge W pickup.
Oh shit! Looks like we're going to actually get Ripley as a survivor after all! HYYYYYYYPE!!!
WE GOT RIPLEY!!!
On my birthday let's gooo
I love this so much
Let’s GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Очень, очень, очень круто!!!!!!! Спасибо вам разработчики за легендарный колаб!!! <:3
Beautiful and a wish come true
Yo i stopped playing dbd like a year ago. I MIGHT HAVE TO START PLAYING AGAIN
Ya pero la de arreglar los bugs y servidores se la saben ??  psdt : basty es gei
Using a flashlight would be weird against it lol
Alien in Dbd turn up.
Интересно как всё это будет реализовано...
i wish there is a map for this
ñipley!!!!!! hahahah where is ripley!!!!
Comes out on my birthday let’s go!
OOOH MAAN, LETS GOOOOO
я в шоке надо возвращать стримы!
another indoor map.. hawkings pt2
Look at you all getting so excited after a 2min clip, lets wait & see what the end product is gonna be like before we all express "ooo this is the best killer " bla bla bla 😮
I think it’s time to come back
Predator of Predator cosmetic for skull merchant
10/10 great trailer. Can’t wait to see the gameplay and perks! Developers did a great job there
Alien in Dbd Turn up.
Yay
Amazinnnnnnnnnnnng!
La habilidad será correr rápido a 4 patas o atacar con su cola, que ansias por saber
All aboard the Hype Train!
If the Xenomorph's power isn't hitting the griddy, then I don't want it
New map ?
YES I WAITED FOR THIS MANY HOURS
Now Since we get this I can’t wait to see what we get in the future 😮‍💨👌🏻
Demogorgon 2.0?
This looks great!  I can't wait to see the new nerf for Pig!
OWO
Why did they make the Killer name the xenomorph?
Xenomorph camping hook with Insidious
Hopefully this will be good as the Halloween DLC. In my opinion that was the only other good DLC that DBD has created
IM SO PUMPED
I need to know what it can do in game
HOLY CRAP CAN HE VENT LIKE THE IMPOSTER FROM AMONGUS?!!?!?!?!
❤ it
WOOHOO!!!
1st i hope we can do the steam thing, 2nd pls don't make this dlc i know you probably will but pls don't, 3rd can you guys be free on epic games again I know what happened last time I cant really persuade you to but pls ive watched this game for years and i got to play for a month which just made me love it more and now i cant play it because my parents dont let spend money on anything really
Why Ripley don't look nothing like Ripley
Holy hell i heard jonesy
Ohh it's finally happening and this time it's not just made by fans
These trailers never seem to be so beautiful yet terrifying
I hope those arent the abilities cause that would be one boring killer if its just a mix of blight, wraith and sadako
WHENS THE BETA
Sicgourney weaver should sue if she receives no profits from this
ok now here's a thought upon watching the trailer when a gen is popped you could have an interactable door to block a killer but opens another door and have it on cooldown for 60 secs or more
I hope no one spoils the mori
Il va être oufissime
Map woulda been cool, this is still fantastic. Keep up the great work Bhvr!
I really hope we could see predator next, but I'm also excited to see what alien will do in-game
No New Map? 🤦🏻‍♂️
Hoping this is far better than the last two killers we've gotten
Kinda hoped for a new map
So... No power reveal? No ptb yet?
YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSS !!!!
I Hope they add amanda as legendary skin
It's kinda goofy that Alien can be stopped by windows n pallets, they can literally climb walls and ceilings. Would make sense for him to have some kinda Legion climb power or some like that.
Alien BIG!
I hope thats their chase music because if it is i would always want to get chased
BRO MY MONEY IS GONE WHEN THIS RELEASES
no f'ing way
I’m so hype for this
In my head  Ripley: is he dead Dwight: oh hey can you unhook me please I brought escape cake and I really what to farm some blood points Ripley: 😐
Ellen Ripley! I'll be damned! <3
Ich finde es irgendwie Peinlich. Alien geöhrt nicht ins DBD Universum
NO WORDS, SO UNREAL!!
now the alien will eat palllets and get flashlighted ,cool
Welp I found my new killer main
This is better than most of Alien franchise
None of my friends play this game. So allow me to vent my excitement here.  Agg..ahem  HOLYL THCK TES BITS HERE BAGY ALIEN
Now I can finally say that they did pretty good job so far i mean it's so far we are in space
0:22 Meow
Yesssss 👐
I have been saying for so long they need to do this!
YES....YES
Riiipley!!!
Nice
Please tell me the cat is okay! Overall, an amazing trailer! I would love to see how the Xenomorf is implemented into the Fog.
ahhhhh! It's ahappenning
Time to stockpile blood points. Getting that lvl 3 prestige xenomorph on day 1.
There are so much Killer now. Wonder if anyone still play the old ones like the Wraith or the Trapper.
I literally just watched Alien in 4K a couple of hours ago. One of the best movies ever made. This is awesome.
BEST DBD TRAILER?!?!?!
W
That was intense holy shizt
more stuff for me on dbdgonewild yeah baby whoo!
New Killer - The Xenomorph  Killer Power  Hidden Pursuit  A series of tunnels become available on the map when the Xenomorph is in play. By accessing a Control Station, it can enter these tunnels to quickly move around the map, detect the presence of nearby Survivors, and speed up the cooldown time of its Runner Mode ability. Exiting a Control Station tags nearby Survivors with Killer Instinct.  Special Ability: Runner Mode  The Xenomorph enters Runner Mode automatically when not on cooldown. In Runner Mode, the Xenomorph walks on four legs and becomes stealthier, reducing its Terror Radius. While in Runner Mode the Xenomorph also has access to a brutal Tail Attack.
that shot. it's perfection 1:06
I've never seen the Alien movies and this still got me hype.
HOLY SHIT THE WUALITY WAS FUCKING INSANE
They should add Matt Cordell
Damn. No new map. Unfortunate.
Pleasantly surprised that we actually got Ripley. Was worried for a second that we would get another character as survivor, like how for the Nightmare on Elm Street chapter BHVR gave us Quentin instead of Nancy.
YES RIPLEY U QUEEM
I can‘t believe this is real right now
My jaw is on the floor. Omg I was waiting for it and was not dissapointed. Now lets see their perks.
Watch the next one after alien is predator
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Make Jonesy part of the map like Maurice or we riot!!!  (This is a joke. Great job BHVR!)
OMG
OMG lets gooooooooooooo
wow cryosleep but generetor ...
Omg
Now swap out skull merchant for predator and we're Gucci.
No map??
No map?
this looks awesome, the Alien is so creepy and Ellen looks like a BADDIE. love her!
This is by far the most beautiful and stunning trailer they have made!!!
I'm just sad the map won't be in space :/
this is so fucking cool dude i never thought this would be possible. also love this trailer and how long it is. usually it would’ve ended the second the new killer shows up
They actually got Otzdarva to voice the cat lmao
nice
Mono Ripley
I wonder what Xenomorph’s ability will be
veeeeeiiii
Demo cousin
This is giving me Alien movie vibes. Giving me the chills ! This trailer probably by far one the best trailers I seen for Dead By Daylight . Just as good as the Halloween Chapter trailer
Absolutely can’t wait for this.  Excellent work!  Haha, as I mentioned in the teaser can’t wait to hunt Nic Cage as a Xenomorph
The Sci-Fi Horror/terror continues!
Let’s go
Nerf to circle of healt and dead hard!!the game is so bored with the new updates!!
give back stranger things map
I'm so sad that Jonesy the cat isn't a survivor.
I didnt see a facehugger😞
AINT NO WAY the alien is proxi camping the dwight
They did it! This is the only killer/survivor I'm playing from now. Also, excited to read the lore for this
Can't wait🙃 but  Ripley looks like not Ripley🤔
I hope when we stun the alien it will make the funny noise it makeswhen it gets hurt
This looks sooo good
Goosebumps it was amazing
oh cmn don't tell me that its gonna be teleportin g around the map like like 5 other killers...
yes yes yes yES YES YEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS
Demogorgan 2.0 less go
Oh Ripley...😣
I'm so getting this
I'm surprised how many people are still excited for DLC's. Nothing changes in this game besides DLC's. Alien chapter should be in DBD years ago xD
Cant wait for the spotlight trailer
With the next chapter being killer only I have to wonder if we’re getting a stand alone Predator to go with Alien..
I wonder What the Killer Powers look like for The THE ALIEN..  other than that ....This is BEST DBD FRANCHISE
This is actually my most anticipated licence after resident evil . I hope we get skins and addition to this chapter
Hope Ripley has Jonesy in her hands while being in the menu.
YESSS
Omg even Ripley’s cat is in the trailer so cute 🥹
Where the map?
Given what was shown in the trailer I hope this isn’t just another teleporting killer with just a vent ability
The madlads actually did it
This looks amazing but Ripley's eyes look hella' off
Just a little bit mad it doesn't look that much like Sigourney but still so dope. We needed this big time. So hyped for this chapter.
OMFG!!!! Congrats Behaviour, you just got me and many like me back into the game!! I have been waiting literal YEARS for this!!!!!
🎉🎉🎉❤
Trailer looks Flipping amazing! I'm just gonna say this now, it better be good in game And nothing bad better not happen to Jonsey!!! 🐈
They trailer is kinda implying that the Xneomorph is going to have similar powers to the Demogorgon. Hopefully it’ll be more unique rather then a Hillbilly and Bubba situation
Just imagine if Predator comes next
Finally, Alien (Xenomorph)  vs  Predator (Nea)
Ripley is not Sigourney Weaver
This. Is. Beautiful.
I can finally play killer and become a killer main (The Xenomorph only) I've waited since 2017 for this day!!
NO ONE IS MORE EXCITED THAN ME. THEY ARE MY MAINS.
Thank goodness it won't be fully indoors.
I will buy this dlc only if it has the motion tracker in game instead of a heartbeat.
New survivor(s?) too let's goooo
passada
NO WAY
Why does this feel so similar to the monster’s ability from the stranger thing? Like the part where it move underground and so
YES
Bruh, the release date is the same as my birthday this is gonna be a blast
This is so INSANE!!!! I hope in next chapter is Serial killer
AMAZING TRAILER! the new map is going to be so good, i just know it.
HES HERE
LEEETTTSSSS GOOOOO IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THIS (I saw the og teaser my hype has just not worn off yet)
Did it just vent
If the music in the video says anything about the alien's chase theme, we might have something to compete with Wesker for best chase music lmao
This is freaking hype

We will defently get the Neomorph, Protomorph, Deacon and Runner as a Skin defently!

We spent years waiting for this and now it’s finally here, anyone else excited to see what the spotlight holds for us?
Impressive, very nice
New Map ?
I cant wait to get whipped in the fog
Omg I'm hyped
큰거왔다 자 드가자
This probably mean we can get a predator chapter as well, they’re made by the same studio I’m pretty sure
Does anyone know if there’s going to be a PTB?
How to say the Alien Isolation Devs went to work on Dead by Daylight without saying the Alien Isolation Devs went to work on Dead by Daylight since a sequel wasn't greenlit :)
Jason or Fnaf chapter when?
IT'S GAME OVER MAN IT'S GAME OVER  😅
My first day of school
IT LOOKS SO COOL AND SCARY
As a Jill main…I hardly except.

You son of a bitch, you actually did it!
THAT'S SICK
Pobre Duaghit siempre le pasa todo
It's probably the best DBD trailer ever, can't wait for it!
I wish they would just make a full on, movie at this point  The animation quality of those trailers is insane
Predator next plz
The only killer I've been requesting has arrived
we need springtrap. (from fnaf 3)
Still can't believe they've actually made it happen!
i am shitting, crying and puking
I grew up with alien and now that it’s coming to DBD, I can die happy
WOW SO AMAZING
Poor Dwight is always the one at the wrong place in those trailers.
The year 3000 and still using generators lol jk
I wasn’t expecting Ripley too! This is awesome!
This cinematic is better than last films
Bhvr often gets critized too harshly, I hope people are realizing now that they are capable of bringing real wonders to this game as well!
BRO I CANT WAIT THAT MAP IS FIRE
Dude after the alien chapter event imagine the predator chapter
I can't expect what kind of ability
🤤🤤🤤
FOR YEARS WE HAVE WAITED ITS FINALLY HERE
They finally added alien
I have waited 3 years for this lets go
NO WAY
W
this is a dope trailer. i cant wait to play both of these characters
Yeah.. this is peak
I love bhvr
This looks insanely cool
Why do I have an overwhelming feeling that the ability for the alien is going to be a copy of the demegorgons
Finally...
YASSS ELLEN RIPLEY YASSS
Cant believe its actually happening
Круто,добавьте пожалуйста маньяка vladsafronow
Ripley’s back, *in the exact way I predicted it.* 😊😊😊

Noice
Wow, this looks amazing! Props to BHVR for stepping their game up this year. This is just what we needed.
LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Неужели, свершилось
They should have made a Prometheus chapter instead of Alien in order to subvert expectations and be unique.
So we get ripleys mom for survivor
SO HYPEEEEEEEEEEEE
Man, dude, I'm soooo hyped from this trailer cannot wait.
Next predator or pumpkin head
So its not in space unfortunately. The alien seems to have some kind of bidedal sprint, and maybe some portal type thing.
So hyped
August 29th :( so far away
I CANNOT WAIT
Jose the space cat. She meowing in space
Dbd take ur time don’t rush this it haves so much oo

“ITS HAPPENING, OH GOD ITS HAPPENING!”  -Scout TF2
キター！
What in the Walmart ass Ripley😪😪
Will the map have a lot of indoors and outdoors at the same time?
They did it
Finnaly
When sex update
Reeeee they actually did it reeeee they jumped the shark reeeee
Omg this was my suggestion! I sent the form!!!!!!
The trapper was hacking. He had territorial imperative before the huntress even came out.
Omg as long as it doesn't play like a demodog clone
It's here!!!
This is a dream chapter come true! I can’t wait to see the mori. It would also be cool when the chapter releases, if some of the original survivors get Nostromo crew outfits. Plus a facehugger or chestburster charm.
Hype
At last
Godddd
Good job I hope the xenomorphs power is done right
