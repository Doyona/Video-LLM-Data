Woah, I’m not allowed to wear casual clothes to sixth form, we have to wear office wear. No jeans, no trainers. And also if we don’t have any lessons until last period we still have to go into school for the study periods. Whilst if we have no lessons after 12 we can leave

‘Yk like,you don’t need to go over your hair’ continues to go over hair. 😂😂
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.   Here’s a reminder of how much God loves you. God bless you🤍

To whoever is reading this— God loves you so so much,He wants to make everything okay with you❤️He knows your pain, He knows how you feel, He loves you so much and for that reason He sent Jesus (the worlds savior😊) to die so that we could all be made right with God if we asked for forgiveness and to start again through Him (because the thing that separates us from God is sin, which everyone of us has done, BUT God loved the world so much that He sent His Son to take the punishment for us & so that through Him we would be forgiven and have eternal life)💕He loves us so much that if we ask for forgiveness and a new start He will give it to us!His love is unconditional, His love is never ending, and His love is for you! He loves you just as much as anybody else! One of His promises is that He will never leave us, He is always going to stay by our side and in fact He always goes before us to work everything out!💕You matter so so much to Him, You are enough for Him, You are never to far away from Him— He loves you always! And the cool thing is that He wants a relationship with you! He wants a relationship with every single person, and He wants to make us all okay again!💕💕
Please can you tell us what products grace uses for thicker hair because I would really appreciate it

GIRL CURL THE ENDS OF YOUR HAIR AND BANGS LIKE Fernanda on her glow up vid
You should cut layers
“I just make such good iced coffee” proceeds to put in 80% milk and 15% sugar 😭😂 all love hahahah. You’ll likely start to like the taste of coffee the more you drink it so you choose!
I’m definitely not a early morning person.
How many times did you say ‘like

My sxth  form  mornlng  routne love from Michelle xxxxxxx 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
i literally do the exact same thing with my pillows to keep spiders away haha i always thought i was the only one and i felt weird doing it but the fact its actually a thing makes me so happy lol
I'm not a morning person 😂
Lacey is really pretty
Maybe get very pale blue sheets with   two white pillows and two very light blue pillows and one dark but not navy blue pillow in the middle of a blue noodle bed thing That's what I have all of it and it makes my room so much better  <3
You and grace should have there own channel where u do pranks and different challenges It would be good
Shot every time she says “like”
Kaci’s vibe at the minute is AMAZING
Quick tip: don't pump your mascara/eyebrow gel wand! All it does is force air into the tube which will dry it out quicker xx
love this video Kaci! i would love to see a room tour, night routine/after school routine🤍 <3
where do you go ???
