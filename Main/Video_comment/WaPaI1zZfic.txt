Sona the laugh machine
So what is sona job? Laugh and annoy the guest?
Bill + Conan = Gold I’m happy I’m able to see these now, even though I’m years late. These are so funny! They play off each other so well
Who is the woman?
Sona has the greatest laugh ever
2:35 his husband pegged him hard
I am sad with truth😢
I miss when Bill Burr was funny. This is when he was still my favorite comedian.
I'm I the only one who thinks Conan looks like John Wayne now?
Conan and Bill are great together
Seriously, I was concerned for Sona. I thought she was gonna kill over.😂
1:06 this is an excellent impression of Conan doing an impression of a banker
Why do women wear shoes with no socks on? 🤢🤮
Lmao “the government gives gold toed socks to every white person in America” DEAD 😂😂
2:45 gas the dog?
dress shoes are slippery....im glad they finally did this.
who's the giggle bot on the left?
Bill used to be funny
My gawd. I’ve only seen this interview in clips. Certified hood classic. 😎
Bill Burr isn't funny.
takes funny shoe off gets made fun of for socks
Bill Burr is the next Jimmy Kimmel
That stupid woman tried to challenge a world class top tier comedian who eats and sleeps jokes for living. I mean seriously, she wanted to put Bill Burr in a defensive position? what was she thinking?
Always wondered what wing tip shoes were in usa when mentioned occasionally.  Now i find they are the shoes we know as brogues in uk.
crazy how they lit two pale redheads so poorly. Bill and Conan look like a pair of Victorian anaemic twins.
Stop doing the bitch it’s not about you. It’s about Bill. You don’t need to perform. Let him do it.
I'm so glad he called out the gold toes
Poor Sona❤🎉
I land on the moon everytime I sit down.
I binged 48 clips of Bill and Conan over the last 10 years, ending with this one, and wow that was an experience. Went from formal guest on the show in the very beginning to just bantering and vibing off each other as they became friends.
that "see how that works" at 2:55 was so gold
We whites should start making up stuff that the goverment hands out to us and back up each others ludicrous claims. (Obviously to cover up the real stuff the gov gives us)
Bill Burr’s got a special coming up, he should be on soon
Why is she there she brings nothing to the podcast
I went to couples therapy and immediately got divorced afterwards 🤣
I love Bill Burr
The conversation is so fluid. Topic to topic was so smooth.
2:34 Sona got taken out by a sniper rifle! 😂
Sona's genuine dislike for Bill makes me like him even harder
burr said california govt handled the wildfires well... shill sell out
I always thought he was referencing Slow Rogan when talks about conspiracy theory "eyebrow raise" people  😆
Coming from immigrant parents but I was born and raised in New York, immigrants in the 1950s-60s saw American men who wore sneakers as men still acting like children, times have changed.!
Who's the female on stage with them? Her laugh is awesome
"Why do you have athletic soles on your wing tips". LOL
Bill Burr is my favourite guest that Conan has ever had. Their back and forth is so fluid and genuine and 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I think it's because us redheads just go so well together in all situations.
great shoes Conan ❤️
This made me really want a Roast of Conan with Bill Burr there!
Great! A sit down with Bill where he doesn't use the F word. Hey Bill, the English language is very rich and there are a lot of adjectives to use DESPITE the F word. Make fun of Conan's 'love making' shoes................................See how it works.......
😂😂
Conan's assistant is so annoying, i quit listening to his podcast after she became main in that show.
Conan: “Would they be swayed by pictures from space?”   Those aren’t photos, Conan, they are paintings.
kinda over bur
Hilarious 😂
Gold toed socks are amazing, Bill is a monster 😂
This is awesome! But who ever chose Super 55 mics doesn’t know anything about audio, that’s just an overpriced beta 58 in a different body. Those mics only survive because they’re so often used as props
Who is the woman in these videos?
These two are an insanely talented duo tho. They complement each other very well. It's those weird friendships where you can be fully yourself and laugh each other's ass off. Amazing to these interviews. Make me genuinely laugh!
The eyebrow people are the best, reminds me to leave
4:10 Donald Trump meeting Elon Musk 4:23 Donald Trump's second administration
Why is there no full video recording of this anywhere?  I found the podcast episode but audio only
These two are great together! Conan’s shoes are way cooler than Burr’s white adult baby shoes! 😅 👟
Shoes i got one pair😂
Actually, the earth spins quite fast. And with rotational gravity, straight lines bend. So it is probable we live on a flat earth
And they say gingers don't have soles
Bill Burr did a podcast interview w/ Bill Maher n Bill said the word ''LIKE'' 973 times, Bill sounded like a Valley teen girl......Here Bill only said ''LIKE'' 158 times.....LMFAO, he moved to CALI  n became a Valley Girl.
Sitcom dad in the 50's... 😂
His wife must be really smart to make HIM back down so often. Probably a really rare match.
I think the most shocking thing of this video is the size contrast in heads, between Bill and Conan - Conan has a freaking MELON lol :) I kid, I kid...
It's an using. But not that funny. Sounds like a laugh track.
Bill IS hilarious but Sona knows the truth. He's a prick. A funny prick, but a prick.
4:56, that's WHY the fake conspiracy stories get spread so much. It's the government's way of diluting conspiracies, so that when one comes up about the government, most people group it with the crazy conspiracies, & that it's fake.
Bill: (About a dog) “I don’t need one I work to much… gas it”  Conan: “Bill”
Why can't I watch full video episodes of the podcast? This would be awesome
Sona running her mouth like she’s important 😂
You think every guy walks around with these? Gold on his toes?
So the joke is that he has dress shoes that don't have smooth soles and socks that aren't totally black? Is it really that ludicrous? Bill Burr's sat there in an outfit that looks like it was put together by a committee trying to design a basic safe outfit for a white high school boy to wear and he's digging into Conan for having smart but practical shoes?
The Eyebrow Raise People. 🤣🤣😂
ALL lovers of Christ knows it's not a globe😂
so pretty much treat women the same as you treat flat earthers
Shoes and socks ?  None of this is truly funny.
He tore Conan to pieces 😅
1:26 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 free gold toe socks just for being white  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Conan is great because he doesn't compete with the  AMAZING  Bill! Love these 2 guys!
Sona was annoying there no way his wife is always right
We need to get Conan back in front of the audience.
For real a conan & bill talk show would be fire or may be a cooking show or a band conan on guitar while burr on drums  the Irish red fox duo
From a man who has more hair around his face where he eats, then what's on his head.
i know exactly why because he slipped once and almost killed himself during a bit they were doing on the show prob never wanted to risk it again.
If you're going to couples counseling, you're probably already not in a great spot. That's probably why it seems like everyone that goes breaks up after... they were kinda heading that way anyway. Speaking from experience.
This is 100% NOT an interview lol this is two great friends having a normal conversation.
"you don't need to pretend like you care"  someone please tell that to 90% of current society. It's all a big virtue-signaling Ponzi scheme  on the other hand, we've overdone the "see how that works?" line and now the crazies are running the show
Bill Burr and I could be BEST FRIENDS!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Man Bill is fast
0:57 Bill looks like Kratos but skinnier.                And Ginger.
I don't care what people believe.. I just need them to stfu about it and have a normal conversation.
Sona still got that fire in her, after all these years lmao
Simp.
Burr on Conan is him at his best. Would be unbelievably funny if this was pre-written, nevermind him just riffing and somehow going from Conan's athletic shoes, to the socks, to his wife, to making fun of Sona, to then agreeing with her for .5 seconds before making fun of how excited she was that he agreed with her. It's genuinely unbelievable to me how funny he can be
2:29 ❤ Sona but her behavior correctly checked by Bill made me happy. Don't know why. But sometimes, we just need to listen to someone instead of reacting to it in an exaggerated manner.
Bill basically improvising a standup
Dont mind him Conan. My highschool uniform shoes are the same. Formal shoes but rubberized soles
Sona acting like she cares only to admit she actually doesnt care lmfao 😂
@ 2:30 lmmfao😂
Bill makes Conan genuinely crack up. They are having a blast.
:') this one is perhaps the best nugget from an interview i've seen in quite some time. what a comedic flow goddamn
Still, no ice in that tea just sugar. Blame that homophobic dude for UK Drill!
In case he gets struck by lightning, gotta put your rubber soles shoes on
You could push him off the edge if it’s flat
Hey Bill. I e been married over 40 years.  You friggen nailed it. Pick the hills you want to fall up
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Team coco why can't we find video of this podcast? Only audio???
GaaaaSSSS ÎṮ
I worked with a flat earther and I asked him one day do you really believe the Earth is flat? His response was of course the Earth was flat that's why the maps are flat. I said okay then and walked away cuz what the hell could he ever have to say that I need to hear by that logic if you take a picture of a vehicle the picture is flat there for the vehicle must be flat
I’m a banker!!! Jajajajaajjajajaj
You can tell Bill's married to a black woman, because he's all like, "What are those!?"
I think Conan mixes well with everyone. Kind of a superpower.
What on earth are wing tips?
These two need a show. Just then bullshitting their wat thru an hour or two… I’d tune in!
Bill Burr looks like Santa  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ZeEU8EVzg&ab_channel=lambiase1
Gas it hahahhahaha
The Earth IS flat, it is Space/Time that is curved.
My parents got divorced after couples therapy.
Conan needs to work on his fake laugh better.
Pretty sure he has those soles after he got a concussion runny on his late show and slipping and hitting his head. Look it up.
Conan's shoes are oxfords, not wingtips.
Bill is in the wrong here.  They are just rubber soles.  Even James Bond wears Dainite rubber soles now with his suits (usually when he is in London).
🏆🍀😆✌️
I think most women agree with men when it's not their husband.
Don't try to defend yourself when Bill roasts you. He smells blood.  Just laugh.
"I don't need you to act like you care"
I've never seen one diss make an entire theater of people crack up laughing and as more people got it the laughs got louder. Bill Is an absolute legend
That "eye brow raised people" bit was hilarious.
O'Brien's a sell-out he used to be fun and funny and laughable but man
love these guys.
The Sun is a sphere  The Moon is a sphere  all the rest of the planets are too  But the earth is like a dinner plate in space.
That’s funny. They look orthopedic.
Bill is One of The Most Divine Men I know on this Planet right now. Mad Respect for This True Man. Not too many free True Men left right now. Most that are True Men, almost all are in a state of being enslaved.   Sad state of things
Also, Andy Richter is slitting his wrists right now.
I like how Conan and Bill are opposite. Conan is dressed formal, wears long sleeves, has hair, clean shaven, has black shoes on. Bill is dressed casual, has short sleeves, no hair, has a beard, and wears white shoes.
Good LORD get RID OF THAT WOMEN. Why does she have a mic?? Why the hell is she up there with these two geniuses?? She has NO CLUE WHAT SHE IS DOING!!! She is So cringe!!! She needs to be taken off of the podcast too along with that other random dude. Seriously Conan you are loosing fans.
Legitimately funny
The Oprah Winfrey interview is my all time favorite between them two.
please give us more bill
2:48  "Bill.."  Ded 💀
It should be illegal for Conan to ever to a show, podcast, etc without Sona. Her laugh is the best
Flat earth baby boy
Why does Conan always have to have someone that sucks the energy out of the room? The fat guy that did nothing on his previous show and this woman who also does nothing. Why Conan, why? Just talk to your guys. You can do this by yourself.
The last sentence is the biggest lie Bill has ever told.
I love to watch Sona just laugh and say nothing- like she can't stop laughing.
Who is the woman with no sense of comedy ?
I love Bill Burr so much I can't handle it. He was always kind to not own Conan on his show, but this is real and I love it. I also love Ginger on Ginger crime.
Loooove bill n Conan
Honestly Mark Wahlberg wishes he was Bill Burr
The earth is Flat, they faked everything!!!
Why can't we just get the full video? This is like that Howard Stern crap.
Please make a Netflix   or  adult swim show only on this amazing  back and forth
2:49  "Well I'm sure your wife is always right, too."  Not bagging on Sona just the state of the world. Flip the script and imagine if a man tried to proclaim that men were always right. Oh, sure, it's all just a joke, but being (god forbid) a white male, having been raised under the blanket of some of the more angry militant forms of feminism, I'm old and worn thin. Time for the pendulum too centre up a bit by now, no?
I love how when Bill gets serious everyone gets quiet.
rocking them Stan Smiths like true Bostonian white boy
Bill Burr using Sona as an example 😂😂😂
Where can we see the full version of the podcast?
How come Team coco on Spotify is only audio?
It's a shame that they don't include any of the discussion before this moment. Bill is going on one of his uncomfortable rants and there is an awkward pause that leads to this random comment about the wingtips, it's even funnier in the context of the full show!
Whos this woman why she there? Heckler decoration?
The co host actually said something, finally! Lol
What a magic team, Conan and Bill... so effn funny and interesting at the same time :))
Who's the broad?
I'm no conspiracy theorist... But I do understand basic mathematics and physics. The moon has 1/7th the gravity of Earth. Someone explain to me how it takes takes a 7-story-tall tank of fuel to leave Earth, but only 6 propane tanks to leave the moon...
Guaranteed Bill is Sona’s favorite guest because she enjoys him busting Conan’s chops so much
2:46 no no i work too much. Gas it.  Damn ahahaha
Does anyone else find it hilarious that Conan O'Brien left cable a dying industry, and took his image, fan base, show, and friends with him.
Bill Burr and Timothy Olyphant should be the only two people allowed to be on Conan's shows.
conan looks like he got the joan rivers special at the plastic surgeons
Some of these conversations don't need Sona faking interest... Glad Bill called her ass out
Only these guys can keep you laughing for 5 minutes because of a pair of shoes
I watch this often ONLY to watch my girl crack up .  SISTA is absolutely gang's with the lean over laughter.  Baha!  Love her!
"win" arguments with the wife?  when did that ever happen?
— I don't need you to act like you care!
Damn, sad to say, but for the rare times, this time doesnt work for Sona. She cant be on Bill amd Conans dynamic. Rmeinds me lf the H3 podcast
Mmmmmm Sonja
Idea from this: You tell a flat earther that the earth is flat just some if the time. When it deflates.
Where can I watch or hear full episode of this? All I can find is clips
2:54 "See how that works?" 😂
I belive the earth is flat u can talk to me bill 😂
Couples therapy works, it all depends on the psychiatrist. Some suit, some don’t. The one I had that worked sided with me 😂😂
Yet the earth is flat and people are finally realizing it.
conan is the only good late night host
Who's the unattractive woman on the left? She has no personality at all.
Where can I watch the full video?
2:34 Bill read her right on point. Women most of the time don't care about male problems, they just wanna seem like they do.
I have a neighbor who thinks that Earth is flat. The kind of bullshit she has said on the subject is scary.
The eyebrows raise people 😂. When you work in sales and have to talk to many people you meet many of them.
My god i love Bill Burr, he's just so funny, best comedian around imo
Is there a link to the whole episode on video?  Couldn’t find just the whole thing.
She’s hot af
I'm Bill Burr's look alike. People think I'm him all the time. I even talk like him.
Watch out bill, the ones who control the media might not like you criticizing the ones who control banks.
Who's the weird chick😮
Truly though.. if there's some kid in the street about to walk into traffic, or maybe an active shooter .. be glad you have grippy shoes.  He'll, those stupid dress shoes normally just slip around easy on buffed floors, people fall, sometimes get paralyzed etc. Why not have function and "fashion"
The Federal Reserve is as Federal as FedEx, and if you want to have fun, get drunk and go on YouTube and have a back and forth with a flat Earther.
Dude this podcast format for Conan is incredible, it's so much better than the studio version.
I've always liked the bill burr and conan combo and this time too. Just felt a little bad for Sona. Stereotyping sometimes is not just on the surface and it runs deep and can hurt.
If the earth was flat, the edge would be the biggest roadside attraction of all time! 😂
props to Conan
Bill is so pale recently, he has twice the white privilege
The female said a total of 7 words 😂
... did Conan ever get to boink his assistant like he wanted to do on his original show, she' s cute !
Sona does not like Bill ----> Bill is doing something right
She is laughing and bill acts like she's not there u can tell he can not stand her lol
Bill is definitely the most funny person who ever existed
I think Conan could rock Birkenstocks with socks.
Gas it. Lol
Why didn't bill Burr get with Conan sooner???
👏
All jokes aside the way Bill split second "tractor-beamed" in on the guy from the crowd was amazing actually.
Just great energy between Burr and Conan.
Bill Burr is the quintessence of necessary evil
I can listen to Bill all day long. Because I can relate to everything he says.
I don't believe we didn't land on the moon, I just don't believe the US-Americans did it in 1969.  I think they made that up because they were about to lose the race, and once no one was looking anymore, they went up there preparated everything as it did happen. I mean who could prove them wrong at that time, but they had to do it at some point, because, one day someone may have landed up there to check it out.
He is right couple's therapy does not work
why would you shoot yourself in the foot by NOT having full video of the podcast with Bill Burr? only couple of short videos, and AUDIO podcast. I mean, come on. It's Bill Burr, how can you NOT upload the whole thing?
"I call them the eyebrow people. 'Hey, you know what else?'" Omg I freaking lost it when he called them that. That is classic Bill Burr comedic genius.
There’s no duo I enjoy more than Conan and Bill. Much like he did with Norm, Conan just lets bill be bill and contributes in his own way as well 😂
I’m wearing gold tipped socks right now 😂
How much seltzer is in the oceans? The earth IS flat.
He murdered him wit the 1st line😂😂😂😂
Conan has a great voice, should be a character in bill’s show F is for Family
Old Cop Shoes Conan they called him
Burr sounds like he is starting to go woke
Sona has the GREATEST JOB, add NOTHING and get paid for it 😂 atleast she does more than Jordan 😂😂
“Want one??” “No I work too much. GAS IT” Bills on demon time
... always bright and intelligent humour !!!! seems easy to do but it' s NOT !!! Bill Burr z' the master !
Pre-Covid, I went onto the website for the flat earth society annual conference. They had an embedded map to show how to get to the conference. Of course, if you scrolled out on the map, it would show the whole globe as most of us know it. I laughed so hard at that and I was reminded of that when listening to Bill talk about the irrationality of conspiracy theorists.
Man just put those two in a room, give them one question the open the evening and they go on for hours babbling about everything and nothing in a super funny way
"GAS IT."
The Bilbur and Conad hour would be a gr8 shoe!!
bill & conan are such a good pair even the hair on their heads complete each other
Bill and Conan are the best comedian duo ever created!!!
🤣😅😂
I think Sona definitely demanded a raise from Conan after this podcast.
Bring back Gov't cheese. I miss it...
Couples therapy - https://youtu.be/iwwcMjlcxSc
Where is full interview
I wear gold toed socks.
"Why do you have athletic soles on your wing tips?" is probably one of the greatest conversation starters of all time
Having watched 5 or 6 shorts of this conversation the female panelist never has anything to say that's not critical towards Bill.  Who tf cares what she thinks?
What I really like about Bill Burr and what makes him really funny is that he calls people out on the littlest of things, making them stutter and stumble through words half way through the conversation 😂
so gingers do have soles.
I think the new name of this podcast should be Conan needs another sponsor
Because they’re comfortable lol 👍🏼
Translation. Bills dumb black wife broke his spirit.  And thats why his last two stand up's were sub par.
Me, who is currently shopping for hybrid wingtips: 🙃
I don’t understand why Sonia was there, she’s funny sometimes but she just didn’t fit in well here
You can tell that woman got offended and tried to play it off
Oof when he said federal reserve you know everyone clutched their ass
that girl wants to  bang bill burr
Great chemistry  between  those 2
Bill learned from future n Patrice game on lock lmao
A long time ago I was told that in order for you to be funny you have to be able to laugh at yourself. Truer words have never been spoken.
Why is that woman on stage ?  Did they need to fill a quota ?  Did they run out of chairs for the audience ?
Bill is one of the naturally funny people. 👏👏👏🤣
Why is there another person on the pod to just sit there and laugh
If more people would be like bill I’d be more thankful on being a stupid vet!
Love this guy! Best wishes for a healthy and safe new year.
Where's the full Episode?????!!!!!
Athletic Wing tips for a pickup game of hoops... *JW's and Mormons enter the chat*
Do they only do the video for a portion of the podcast or is there somewhere to watch full episodes? ive only found audio.
if someone says the earth is flat i say the earth was invented by map makers to sell more maps
2:36 best part lol
I love when people bring out the comedian in Conan instead of the late night host who sets up comedians.
There's a radio term for her: The Hole. Sucks up all the energy.  Why is she even there???
Sona’s reaction is the best part.
Between bill and conan that is the perfect hair and beard combo 🔥🔥
Bill is fricking hilarious! He's the best when he's with Conan, I'd love to be at their party hahaha!
This middle age woman annoys me. WTF she is? among these great men to interrupt, But that brings a spiciness to Bills mood so...
That lady makes a great butt of the joke in every clip of this show I've seen
🤣🤣🤣🤣the eyebrow raising people!!!5:27
Gas it 😂😂 so quick no one noticed
As a Black man, I *KNEW* all y'all white people got free gold-toed socks from the government! I just could've prove it!!!
I love Sonya and all but when these two are together she should have her mic muted. She’s great otherwise but these two just need to talk alone for ehours
It would kinda be interesting for a person that has "the earth is flat theory" to be taken to space.
It's a sorry thing that happen't to Bill Burr
2:48 She tried to flex and Bill straight dunked on her. Legend!
2:55 rekt
Two dudes from Mass
Someone please tell me they also remember Bill's joke from his "I'm sorry you feel that way" special where he fantasizes about strangling a person wearing gold tipped socks on a plane. 😂😂😂
My BIL is a flat earthers and Holocaust denier. I can't stand to be around him.
So he's back to doing late night shows yet again? How is this a podcast?
Post the entire podcast video.
If they started a show together , it would be hard to find anything funnier …
Welcome back to your Bill Burr binge.
Just 1 quick hypothetical question... Is there a 3rd wheel in this group?
I just noticed the sponsored by Chevy in the background right at the end 😂
1:36 LOL
Here we go again. Binging conan videos.
Hands down the best guest ever in Conan. Bill is the only guy who could make Conan laugh unapologetically and let loose on his own show.   I hope Bill has Conan on his podcast.   Then they need to write and star in their own series. Maybe Netflix, since they let bill do whatever he wants.
Jesus not even 7 seconds in I'm dying ☠ Look at Sonia! Bill is all non chalante, being himself
please upload full video episodes!
Dude the gold toe socks.. I think Conan wore those on purpose just for Bill 😂
I love Bill and Conan unconditionally, but OMG Sona is paralyzingly gorgeous. Love y'all, and best!
Hilarious the entire podcast 😂
conan's sidekick is actually a disadvantage wow. why not just do the podcast one on one with the guest.
Bill Burr is the world's most well-adjusted man, while at the same time, an effing maniac.
Bill's head is so shiny you can see the lights reflecting off it 😂
I’m so here for the Sona and Bill Burr dynamic. The rescue dog bit was so funny
Bill Burr exposing THE HOLE. At least she doesn't say much.
Now this is the red wave.
Hey...I wear gold toed socks.
gas it.. 🤍
Two legends who helped make each other legendary
Bill Burr stopped being funny about 5 years ago.
how do you watch to video of this on spotify?
Two Red Headed comics from the North and an assistant who would have been fired years ago just trash talking each other and things Lol.  I love these 3. Also Bill Hader, but Burr is just a different kind of funny.
Emma stone or Ammy Adams would be a better choice
LOL my white stepdad wore those socks with the gold tips so I believe you
I identify more with Burr growing up in  suburb of Boston.  One of the bluest but most segregated places I have ever been!
I love Conan because he literally isn't like the other guys in late night. That have to be part of the joke or making the joke... he is perfectly fine being the joke too sometimes and rolling with it.
These guys are funny, they should try comedy
😂 😂 😂 1:16 min It's great to be a red head in the white world (👊🏻 and jokes 24/7)! 😂 😂 😂
Gas it! 😂
2:50 😂🤣 F... genius!!!!!!!!!!!
Bill Burr didn't really hold back with Sona there
I have never seen anyone make Conan laugh harder than Bill Burr
Legendary duo Conan and bill ,, nostalgic ,, 1million + views 10 days damn 🔥🔥🔥
"it's great to be white" "I say that every morning, as always people do." Haha so true
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btsyaqlcQiY
I could listen to them talk all day. So good.
Who's that woman with them, the laughtrack?
Free gold toe socks!!  😂😂😂😂
I've seen some of those before
I have always loved these two together Conan just knows how to wind them up let him go
Getting tired of bill burr and America. Starting to think you’re easily amused idiots
The banking system and Fed reserve isn't a conspiracy theory.. Read, " Creature from Jekyll island".. great book, may I also suggest, "War is a racquet" by Major General Smedley Butler... everyone would have a better understanding as to why the World is the way is, especially during these times.
Love how Burr effortlessly shuts that pc Sona down 😂
What, shapeshifters don't exist? How can you proof that? Who cares?... as long as there are free doughnuts at the vaccination station 😁 and free health care once the side effects kick in 🤣
Bill is a beast
wait is that sona on the right? wow she's come far
who is she?
Thank you for making life more tolerable
Sona is what they used to call "THE HOLE" back in the O&A days.
White people am I right
Anyone knows Where can I watch full video interview?
"I don't need you to act like you care." Zing!
It was nice of Conan to not bring up Bill dressing to match the backdrop.
This isn't a conspiracy theory.  Landlords charge the most mo ey they can and do little to next to nothing upgrading the buildings and infrastructure. It's reality.
These 2 have to be friends outside showbiz, right?
What do you mean some people think the Federal Reserve is sort of a Ponzi Scheme. Sort of? The Federal Reserve it's the perfect definition of a Ponzi Scheme. I am not a conspiracy theorist of any kind. I just studied economics and finance. It creates money from nothing (our money is no longer tied to gold reserves, it's FIAT money, it's based simply in the faith that the US Government will be able to meet its financial obligations. That's it. Our government needs money to run the country, it ask the Fed for it. They print it and then we increase our national debt which we attempt to pay in part with taxes (I spare you then how the money the government borrows, once deposited in bank accounts creates more and more money, since the banks only need to keep 10% of it as reserves......). If this is not a Ponzi Scheme, I don't know what is!!! (the vast majority of Americans of course don't know that the Federal Reserve, intelligently named as such, it's not a Federal entity at all. It's just a private bank owned by some of the richest people in the world who operate it with the intent of making money. Sorry, no conspiracies here, just plain facts you can find in any first year books of economics and finance in any serious graduate school in America
chevy gave bill a 2500 hd? lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Eye Brow Raised People!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
the second i saw Conan's socks I knew Bill couldn't resist a comment
GREAT TRIO!
They are dress shoes. Nothing Burr would have to worry about being a comedian. Us far less-talented people have to dress professional.
Love how Bill makes Conan taste his own medicine.
Conan’s reaction to comments is masterful haha
What's the bimbo even doin there at this point lol
“The eyebrows raise people“ LMAO!!
I slowly died inside 😂relatable 😅
The EYEBROW people!! 😳 😂🤣😂🤣
We didn't land on the moon.  Proof:  America is the only country that ever did.
Rescue dog commercial 😂😂😂  "Aww You want one???"  "Nah I work too much....gas it" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ok, Conan.  I support having nice looking shoes that are practical to actually move around in.  Now just help me find ones that fit -.-
I like that Bill's approach to a flat earther approaching him at night is the same approach he uses with his wife. Agree and try to move on
That’s what Bill had to go through every time he sat down with Patrice O’Neal.
Who is the woman? Is she like Conan's show sidekick?
I love this 😂
I understand that woman was part of his team during his late night career but she has no business being up there with the guest. There's nothing charming or funny about her. She just laughs and sits there like she's at the same level as Bill and Conan.
Moon landing was staged, but Stanley Kubrick insisted to shoot on location.
I had to do a double take! I thought the thumbnail said Conan’s Hoes….😅
Bill: "I don't need you to act like you care."   The perfect response to women
I wish Conan would have started his podcast when Norm McDonald was still alive.
If Dave Chapelle and Bill burr performed together, that would be the best comedy show in history and I would pay top dollar to see it. Those two are my favorite comedians… Absolutely hilarious.
Slightly disappointed the parallel between agreeing with the wife and the conspiracy theorist wasn’t brought up, especially when they mentioned being around the theorist for the rest of your life
Bill Burr is just fantastic
This was hilarious 😂 Sona can get it too
I love Sona falling out of her chair when she laughs❤️that’s fantastic 🤣🤣🤣
They should do a series of internet shorts where they play Irish men in the bar talking crap back in the 1800s
Audit the federal reserve.
4:05.   Damn strait it was done in a studio.  Not one person has landed on the moon ,  like people saying terrorist were to blame for 9/11.  It was a national tragedy though... 9/11.  🤣🤣 Rip Norm.
Conan would totally start a b ball game randomy wearing those
As someone who's not mentally blind I can definitely confirm that if you acknowledge one proven conspiracy you'll have to fight atleast 10 crazy ones if you want to be able to have a conversation about it.
The Economic system actually is gamed...He's not wrong about that one.
That was funny.  Who is the girl?
The guy that said no sounded like Jordan Schlansky
conan fused podcast with live audience perfectly
PUT THE VIDEO ON SPOTIFY OR RELEASE IT HERE ON YOUTUBE PLS, THX.
😂😂😂😂😂
I've literally just had a "dude you kno what ELSE?!" situation. Not Fun. 🤣
677
Why is she there?
Conan may be tall & he may have big shoes… but I bet $20 that he has a small peepee lol
The flat earther would then be asking you to be his best man at his wedding a week later. Then a week after that you'd have to help him move.
Let's gooo Bill Burr wants to end the Fed.
I love how instantly Bill called Sona on her bullshit.  Haha.  Fake sympathy *DENIED!*
Sona, got defensive after 1 of Bill’s rips..  Conan’s been getting roasted for nearly 3 minutes straight..
Bill and Conan complement one another so well. It's always a pleasure to see them together. Sona, however, is contributing nothing. Why is she even there? Certainly not as an Andy Richter replacement, that's for sure.
Can't we just get Conan on National television nightly?? I mean this is great, but his fame has never died and is on top level
Yes happy to be white
"Feels like a sneaker, looks like a shoe"
It's painful to see Billy with his balls clipped.
If you talked to a flat earther they would make you think the earth is flat.   Be careful when talking to them .  Very convincing
For all people who think Planet Earth is flat i have one question.When you go outside of your house at night and look at the Moon,is it flat or round?
02:35 - 😂😂 This Savage Moment Should Be In History Book ..
Bill hates Sona .sees her as freeloading off their comedy.
Bill Burr becoming less angry and more well adjusted has hurt his act. He was funnier being an immature smart ass
The girl being like “No I don’t care” who is this bitch haha
Patrice would be proud!
Did Sona hem her own pants? That's all I can see.
As an LMFT I can tell you that not everyone that goes to couples counseling gets divorced.  (And that ones that do are not our fault - trust me!)
kinda funny I'm getting divorced to my wife after couple therapy lol. its amicable and very mutual which is very nice!
Man, at 2:49 the way he threw that line out was incredible but it reminded me of Don Rickles so much, Bill is hilarious
Sonya is dying lmfaoo
Two of the funniest people in  the business
I can now say with confidence, "You think I'm wrong? Do you see these socks? Conan O'Brien wears these socks!"
GOLD TOED SAWXX
why is this only clips?! where are the full episodes
Sona "Awwwwwww, don't say that" Movsesian
2:48 How Bill explains just agree with them and then points out how they grin when you do, then portrays women like children.
Conan took Bill's heat off of Sona with a serious question to save her right quick lol
Bill Burr is so naturally funny
"no middle ground with conspiracy theorists"
These two for real should do a movie together. Or the very least a show on Netflix or something where we can binge watch 10 episodes for like 5 seasons. Hahaha. Comedy gold every time
A lot of what Bill Burr says could be a bit. He’s just so natural like that.
Clones don't have the balance like real people, so they have to add traction shoes. There are other signs that Conan has been replaced.
Conan wanted bill to be against the moon landing so bad!
2:46 "you want one"  "no, no I work too much"  "GAS IT" LMAFOOOOOXDDDD
Bill Burr out here looking like Kratos 🪓
"No, no, she is right a lot of the time. See how that works?" Lol.
Easy way to prove the world is a globe: go to the ocean and watch a boat sail away from you. It appears to "sink" as it creates distance between you. If the world was flat, you wouldn't just see ocean on the horizon, you'd see the other continents 3,000 miles away. But because we're on a globe, the horizon is only a few miles away.
BB taking the "happy wife, happy life" to another level.
Is there someway to see the full episode in video form?? All i can find is the podcast which is only audio. I wanna see the full video. But where?
Seriously, the world would be a better place if Bill Burr was president.  I’m not saying he would do a great job (ie Cruise Ships) but at least he’s real as hell.  Even though he’s a leftie I would still think, “Bill’s a gawdam genius, what does he have to say about being left that I need to hear”.  One of my favourite people in the world.
They do it all from a studio man ~Bill Burr
Am I too stoned or Bill Burr's head is shining too much.
ugh these podcasts are so lame, no one needs an audience, although i’d would be cool to be there it just makes them less personal and comfortable they can’t be themselves and won’t say what they normally would or open us as much
We didn't land on the moon? Send Bill on the first crewed Artemis flight. :)
bb's genuinely funny, without even trying.
Hearing Bill say how he slowly gives in to different marriage battles makes me die on the inside. Be a man again ya dirty ginger!
🤣 I love Bill Burr. Makes me laugh literally every video I watch.
2:54 was funny, damn bill cracks me up.
All the money and power and they wear this crap on the Show. They haven't truly laughed since their MANHOOD got taken .
Who's the annoying chick sitting in Andy's seat?
Bill Burr and Conan could read the phone book together and it would still be hilarious
Bill Burr in couple's therapy...🤯
Smart of Bill to just refer to the Federal Reserve and 'banking' without directly naming the problem. Conan was on point too to keeping the conversation general. You don't publicly name the problem. We've seen how that goes recently.
The best chemistry
Dude this podcast was so funny. When Burr was dying laughing at Bigest Loser constestants crying over eating too many Oreos while he was coming back from 3rd world countries, I was crying laughing
LOL. my next favorite interview next to this.   https://youtu.be/JBsRQLoqdyw
It's changing to like a mini version of his previous show now? With an audience?
Love my monthly gold toes socks.
Bill should be in a movie where he IS the therapist in couples therapy session.  I'm laughing and its not even a thing yet!
Unfortunately My brother is a flat earther and there's no changing his mind lol
WHY IS SHE THERE? maybe conan returned a favor😏
I love how at 2:50 when she's playfully making a joke and goes to touch Bill's arm he immediately takes it off the armrest.
Finally, someone called out his clothes!🤣🤣🤣
Why is this not 5 hours instead of 5 minutes? I just love their chemistry!
God these guys have such a great chemistry. I wish they did it more often.
"I'm sure your wife is always right" How you know? Have you heard their arguments?
my weed dealer was an eyebrow raiser dude. Went over to buy 20 bucks worth and had to sit through 4 hours of conspiricy theory. Now its legal and I just say Hello and goodbye lmao
Bull burr looks like kratos
where can I find the whole video of this interview
why do armenians always have to piggyback on success of others?
That callout at 2:33 reminded me of Patrice. <3
He roasted his shoe so hard he had to take it off before burning his foot.
It is true though couples therapists are the worst at giving relationship advice. Hence why a lot of them have like 4 divorces under their belt. Their advice is either "open the marriage" or divorce
That's a big fact. Anytime I express a slight interest in some kind of conspiracy not even me believing, but just genuine interest in what people think; people automatically assume im into all the other conspiracies as if people are all one dimensional
omg with the dr scholls inside lolllll
I love how Bill feels comfortable to be himself with Conan
Look at Burr zeroing in on the guy that defended Conan's shoes!
“I don’t need you to act like you care.” 😂😂
He's right about the moon hoaxers and the flat earthers... anyone with real questions about official narratives gets lumped in with those. By design. (That's another conspiracy theory... a true one).
Does anyone else wonder if Gourley sat this one out because of the first year's encounter with Bill? (He wasn't on Burr's second episode either.)
This is so great. Gotta love Bill and his mind.
Man bill burr and conan combo should appreciated more,  worth million
Bill Burr's response to the "awwww" is very real ☠️
Da earth is flat. Change my mind! 🙏
This episode feels like two dads seeing each other after a long season and every topic under the sun is just freaking gold ~
Who honestly believes that a floating currency and printing it into an oblivion without having anything tied down to it is a right way forward is beyond me. Its a house of cards. Gold standard needs to be restored.
I've watched Conan religiously since 1996. At 2:58, he's the most real he's ever been in public - about how you talk to your therapist vs a couple's therapist - that, my friend, is the voice of experience.
I like how Bill just instantly mocked Conan's little snide white guilt/privilege remark out of existence.
i’m sick of sona now at this point
Can definitely see what Bill's friend was saying, as soon as a couples therapist gets on someones side it's game over pack her up
Conan looks more Korean than I remember.
I believe Bill to be correct as I and everyone I know who's gone to couples therapy are now divorced
Sona is the GOAT
Bill Burr is outta pocket roasting Conan like that out of the blue 🤣. Madlad took one look at his shoes then immediately roasted tf out of Conan lmfao.
I tought Bill was Managing Man United
Went to couple's therapy., Immediately got divorced aftrerwards.  ✋
They need a full show lol every interview these two can just never run out of steam as long as the cameras are on
Gold, Conan could have the best Youtube channel
Gas it 😭😭😭
2:48 legend at work.
A that chick'S doing what with these two ?  Not funny for sure
Adult sized chairs…. Smart. 😉
I’m not pro Federal Reserve but I said this 15 years ago to a boss and he pushed me into Alex Jones and 9/11 gun alien stuff was nuts. Lol!
what is with the studio audience for a podcast lol.  feels weird AF
One of the best hour of CONAF!!! Bill and Conan should think about doing a regular show. These once-in-a-while interviews, while great, are just not enough.
Theres a firmament Bill!  😆
Wait wait, did BB say he doesn't think we landed on the moon?
Its sad Burr is so funny but every other joke  he spews flamin libral "whyte guilt" nonsense. It ruins the bit
One of the greatest all time..Ole Bill
Bill on 🔥
I love how with a simple, mundane sounding sentence Bill can have everyone howling 🤣"why do you have athletic soles on your wingtips"
The eye raise people 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂  this and calling the ESPN analysts the "And And And" guys is comedic genius 💀💀
I swear, I watch Bill Burr in interviews just to calm down. Lol play it in the background and die laughing
"Eyebrow-raise people". I'm stealing that.
Free gold toed socks LUL
The second he said gold toe socks I looked down and laughed my ass off as I stared at my own gold toe socks
Lol eyebrow people "you know what ELSE?"
Can Burr and Conan get together and make a podcast or some other show? Good lord they play off each other so well.
where's the edge
Bill you are a wild man!   love your sense of humor
I recently watched a debate on youtube about the moon landing. I was convinced by both arguments so I'm still not sure 😁😂
Is bill burr slowly becoming Kratos of comedy 🤔
my jaw hurts from laughing so hard
its like a cereal bowl evidently 🤣
Sadly,  I love gold toe socks!
4:23 One of my favorite interactions was at an optometrist's office. A woman decided to tell me about how her mother was going to hell because she didn't accept Jesus Christ as her lord and savior. I very intently listened and then she asked me, do you accept Christ as your lord and savior? Being an atheist, this was tricky--and the gears started turning...after a long pause, I said, yes--I do.  Hard to say if it was the wrong decision or not--because the conversation continued which wasn't my goal obviously.
Literally cannot find the full video? Why? Where is it?
You can tell Sona is ready to jump on the woke train
Bill was on fire on this interview, he gets better and quicker with time
“Eye brow raised people” lol
The amount of people that bash Bill Burr is unreal.
Bill "Based" Burr
lmao
“I don’t need you to act like you care ok” 😂
Man...can't laugh anymore.....geezzzzzz......
just two gingers talkin
Where can we watch the full hour long podcast/video?
Bill Burr just casually killing it
My two favorite people and Sona
Andy should replace that woman!
Conan looks like he was in the sun for slightly too long but while wearing a mask. 😂
Comedy is very much a matter of personal taste. Bill Burr has never impressed me much.
Bilbo is on the Tess
Ol Billy-Ballgag Nia doesn't allow you to talk to Ant.
GAS IT! 💨🐕
I wear those same socks. They are amazing and from Kohls.
Conan wearing cheap socks I think is the larger issue here.
"I'm going to keep my thoughts to myself"- Mission: Accomplished!   😀
Conan and Bill should do a regular show together
Billy looks like my yard gnome
"GAS IT" lmfaoooooooooo
Lol I totally get the dying on the inside part... In fact, I realized it's better to just be unhappy internally, than to have to argue things out and make both parties unhappy. Y'all know what I mean?
lol conan and bill always have great chemistry. i could listen to them talk about line graphs for 5 hours and be completely invested
Of course he shits on white people. Bills racism towards whites is easily predictable….
Fans of Bill know how well he gets along with Conan because of how well Conan sets him up. Notice how he gets Bill started on something and then pours a little more comedy fuel on the fire. Fans also know that Bill will completely destroy a weak interviewer.
The Star Wars guy thinks he so funny but he's just a mean jerk
Mf got borrd come back to fo more show weirdo
Bill and Conan has the best host-guest dynamic out there. always making each other laugh.
Sona absolutely dying in the corner is a sight for sore eyes.😂
Love that thick beard on Bill's face!
it is flat   ,
Bill Burr is going full Kratos.
So you white people been quiet about the free socks
Is there a full video of this episode?
great episode
Everytime Conan has Bill Burr on it's amazing!
Wow this is trending at #27 🥳 When was the last time that happened?
It's an anti slip sole. Many dress shoes have them.
How do u get a tix to the show ?
So, what brand are the shoes??
😂
I love Bill Burr dude is HILARIOUS & truly authentic.  He is the epitome of be yourself & say whatever the hell you want totally unable to cancel!!!!
Severe lack of eyebrows in this room
He straight up said "gas it" about the poor dog and no one seemed to catch it!!
Everytime I think of Bill burr I think of the possibility of them continuing f Is for family rip
God i love burr really knows himself lol
mannnn, Bill Burr is great
REMEMBER Bill was in a couple episodes of BREAKING BAD😀?
I had a pair like that
Raven awesome video
It's amazing how much he and primetime Sam Roberts look alike now
Funniest podcast I've ever heard in my life! 🤣🤣
Burr was so on this whole interview
Bill turns it so well im going  to unlock my inner Burr. Shits about to get Ice cold
I could listen to these guys talk all day.
The whole show was recorded no? I'd rather watch the full thing and not just hear the audio.
“No that’s not true” Conan is in couples counseling
im guessing that some people get divorced after couple's therapy because it helps them to realize that they should never have gotten married in the first place.
About to show your true colors again too Conan like 5 years ago lol 😂
like watching a sitcom
I love Bill and Conan together
IPhone this is everyday get mad to everybod
When Conan's Late Night show ended, I was worried we'd never get moments like this with Bill Burr again. I'm glad to be wrong.
Say what's really on your mind Bill.
It’s so sad what bill burr is right now. I don’t think he will find his way back. He’s chosen Disney fame over comedy and that’s fine but why alienate your audience over stupid political stuff just to get a job you used to judge others for taking?
Two of my favorites
Better than Conan show
Is there a full video version somewhere to watch?
I don't think there's anything better than watching Conan O'Brian and Bill Burr trade jokes 🤣 😅 😆
That girl is like a fire hydrant in the desert 🏜
lolol! Like in Burr's special when he talks about the guy on the airplane with gold toed socks, who he wants to strangle.. haha
Like the guy wearing gold toe socks is going to be taking fashion advice from a comedian. C'mon!!
Sona loves when Bill shows up and start busting Conan's balls.
Mayonnaise on a paper plate during a snow storm
It's amazing how much material Bill can come up with on the spot when just talking about Conan's shoes and socks.
Seems like conans humour has changed a bit over the years. Back in the day he would have said something like. Bill was wrong because everyone at the retirement home he visits loves them. He would have rolled with it, but not as much self deprecating humour now
Such a good episode Sona was terrified of Bills humor
where tf can I find the full video podcast?
Can confirm you _never_ just nod and agree with a conspiracy theorist to get them to go away... that's how I found out an (ex) friend of mine was HUGE into Alex Jones and there hasn't been enough alcohol in the world to make me forget those 2 hours. The phrase "just asking questions" gives me horrifying flashbacks.
This was hilarious!!! Bill and Conan riff off eachother so well.
Please upload the part where Bill talks about watching Precious. That was hilarious.
White people are so privileged they don't even have to vote because they already know the winner is going to be white.
Ginger powers activate!
I've just listened to the full thing and it was some of bills best in years, great off the cuff stuff.... But conans assistant really spoiled it at the end with her personal disclaimer... I mean she tried to spoil it a few times during the taping but was masterfully parried by Bill and Conan.. Dreadful, totally sucked all of the air out of the room and into her own ass right at the end.
https://youtube.com/channel/UCBin3ufwWsMC__QUdKdcURw
sona either laugh too much or make us cringe , 0 contributions to the conversation
Bill Burr losing an audience is just about the funniest thing in the world
Bill Burr is a genius
hurts from laughing
Well it's a good day when Conan and Bill come together.
These Two always knock it out the park. There’s another part where they talk about Conan’s Shingles n it’s hilarious. Granted Shingles isn’t funny but they manage to make you chuckle a bit. I mean No disrespect to anyone that may be suffering from that. Not tryna make fun of it 🤙🏾
These two together!!! 🤣🤪🤣🤪🤣
Lose the crowd. Much more fun when it’s just y’all.
Bill look like the blue pen that ran outta ink
I wish Andy were there
Where can I watch the full episode?
Bill burr loving every single second of hearing himself talk
1:01
Bill Burr out there roasting Conan 😂
Uplod the whole thing!
Bill Burr is just naturally on all the time.
Bro i love bill man what a guy
Bill has been broken down so much by his wife, he's almost a normal human being.🤣
Where can i find the entire Thing?
Please upload the full video
She ruins the moment offensively says rude comment against his wife? Geez
Of course we didn't land on the moon. How do you develop any sophisticated machine that crashes after every trip?
burr always firing on all cylinders
Great chemistry these two.
Bill and Conan in an interview with some random Broad sitting in.
you ever gage your mort
one time Conan tried to run across like letterman and he lost traction and slammed into the curtain wall
Where is the full version?
wheres the rest of thissSsss??
Anyone know what platform has this in full?
Don't you just like it when two of your favorite guys get together and get along so well.
This is gold! Gold pointed socks kind of gold!
I like how Bill sits in his chair like it’s about to catapult out of the building lol
Listened to this on a walk today.  Busted out laughing so many times.  Can’t tell you how many looks I got from random people.  Fn love Bill and Conan!
Bill would be perfect to play a live kratos.
Conan + Bill Burr = CLICK
Bill finally grew beard. This is great
Athletic soles on wingtips is genius!
Imagine Bill and Jordan together…
Why does Matt Gourley skip when Bill Butr is on?
"No no, she is right a lot of the time... see how that works?" Bill Burr is quicker than the Flash in all the right places.
Bring on the lizard people, ( they have weak jaws. )
The funniest part about this video is that 5 seconds before this they were talking about Israel and Palestine.
Bill Burr seems a little off or disinterested on other podcasts, like it's a waste of his time but he has a new movie to promote. But when he's on Conan he let's loose and has a good time.
Anyone know what sneakers Bill is wearing please, I love them.
the last minute .... 100% true. why we can't have good things. even conspiracies are ruined. give them an inch and they go so far out there and are so stuck to it they ruin anything remotely plausible.  truth drowned by asshats.
Another classic gold toe socks rant: https://youtu.be/c_yLcjqqzl8
Bill Burr rocking that Krato's look.
The eyebrow raised people
A conspiracy, by definition, is two or more people who conspire to perform a heinous act. A person who suspects some group of conspiring, is simply one who seeks the validity of a conspiracy. That is a rational act.
I'm white and I've never received any gold-toed socks 🤨...what, only white MEN get them??
Goddam! Billy killed it on this one. G.O.A.T
One of a kind…so glad to share a birthday with him
This is such a cool show! You can speak freely, and Sonya is a great partner!
Woke Bill Burr stinks.
There will never ever be enough of these 2 together!
Sona always wins, god bless her
I don't know what shape the Earth is but I know its name is Pookie
Why can’t we watch the whole episode? Where can I watch it?
As expected, Bill crushed it again. 😄 I was laughing throughout. It definitely helped that I just recently started listening to his podcast and a lot of what he said he covers there too. The most hilarious part was seeing Sona and others getting more and more awkward as the episode went on while Bill and Conan were dying laughing. 😆
That's why I got divorced, I woke up one day and realized that I was slowly dying inside. I wasn't happy, I was just agreeing so she'd shut up, and I wasn't living life I was just going through the motions. That's what women do, now I'm single and it feels like I can see color for the very first time.
Earnestly love these two irish men  Its weird. I dont know them personally. But they legit make everything better
I don't think there's anybody who doesn't believe the bankers are corrupt, that should just be called fact, not a conspiracy theory.
Did he start buying those after the slip he had on the tonight show?
Nia convinced Bill that long, thick ones go in too deep and small, tiny ones feel the best
Burr and Conan are like Dangerfield and Johnny Carson. Kills every time and both hosts just let them GO. I would throw Norm in their too
Conan gotta stop with the jean jacket over dress shirt and tie. Not a good look
burrs beard is taking on a life of its own dont hate
The funniest and palest guys in the world.
This was so funny I wish it was longer
Can't wait for this Friday to see Conan!!!!!!! NYC comedy festival 💕💕💕💕😁❤️❤️
When Bill picks on Conan: 🤭 When Bill picks on Sona: 😐
3:00 hahaha I love it
Bills sneakers on that terrible special is laughable
If anyone knows what shoes they are, please lmk. I want to buy those.
Lmaoo I thought the gold toed socks were fake but Conan literally had them
BILL! ❤
PLEASE how can we view these whole sitdowns???
If you add Conan and bill Burr you get a full red head.  Red head and beard.
Rubber Soul
Couple's therapy worked soooo well for us. Sometimes people just don't know how to talk to each other
Don't really like this format... lost the mics if you are going to have an audience.
Wish Sona wasn't there.
How can you watch the full video podcast?
I like Bill Burr's beard, looking good. Together with Conan they look like a good friends who wholeheartedly share everything, they even split one set of male beard and hairdo.
These 2 need their own show/podcast in the worst way, and bring along Andy, Sona and Jordan
This segment is better than anything Jimmy Fallon has ever done.
One of my most favourite guests on the show. Bill is always relentlessly funny. Emphasis on the relentlessness, LOL👍
Never saw anyone call out Sona so well. Nicely done.
Conan might as well just make this the new tonight show lol
I love how Sona has the whole world mesmerized but has no effect on ol Billy 2-weeks-away-from-retirement-jaded-cop over there.
Is there a full version of this conversation?  EDIT: just found it on Audible
I feel like the audience and cameras made Conan and Bill more tense.
1:06 the chappelle show bill burr came out
Pale force 3
The earth isn't flat, just look at the moon when it has a crescent. That crescent is the earth's round shadow cast on the moon.
Where's Matt Gourley? Everytime Bill Burr shows up I can't see Matt Gourley. I like both of them!
We didn't land on the moon.   But hey, at least you're still in Hollywood Billy Buck face.   Way to sell out.
I heard Bill Burr was a reptilian until I realized they don't tell as good of jokes, so he must just be a hurting child who has never healed inside. 🤷🏻‍♀️😘
where is his Blades of Chaos? 😁
Burr has done Conan so much that he has gained the comfort to pick on Sona sheerly through years of secondhand interactions
"I don't need you to act like you care" LMAO
“See how that works” lmfao
Who needs clickbait with these two on the show?
Conebone69
Bill Burr looks like that charcter from God of War game
My face hurts from laughing at this episode! Conan is the only host that can keep up with bill, they've got great chemistry.
More Bill Burr and Conan please
Conan and Bill were made for each other. Andy is obviously amazing, but I feel like Bill would have been an amazing wingman on the show too
Ever since Conan fell down during his foot race with Teri Hatcher , seems a logical choice.
Where can I watch the full episode?
Bill Burr making fun of Conans sensible dress shoes while hes dressed like a teenager heading to highschool in the 90s.
This video brought to you by good old ZIP.......................................AAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHHCRUTER
Burr is hilarious
Please release more clips of this episode
2:54 Genius LOL!  5:12 Umm, The Big Short anyone? 2008 financial crisis? Synthetic CDO's? It's no conspiracy theory. Geez.
YOOO NEW BURR AND CONAN
I watch and listen to Conan since the late 90s (back then I didn't even understand the language but loved the shows nevertheless). I've just heard this full episode and find it to be sincerely one of the best ever. My asthma got worse today.
You: The world is flat. Me: You could be right? Or you could be a blithering idiot. Guess what I think?!!
Not married.. but I remember getting into marriage type fights with an ex I was with for years. The ultimate result was always fighting about the fact we were fighting.. Completely forgetting what started the fight in the first place. 😂
Bill burr wearing Sam smiths?
I love their Paddy heads...we can identify eachother from a mile off 🤣
Two GREATEST COMEDIANS EVER
The number of absolutely unrelated topics they went through in 5min is crazy, and why watching Bill and Conan is always hilarious.
I thought when the late night show ended. I wouldn't see this two sharing a stage again. Glad I was wrong.
What kind of shoes is burr wearing
How is it that Conan and Bill never miss!?
.....can't slander a dead person
Hand over the full video episode of this w/ Bill Burr and nobody needs to get hurt.
It's now a Madoff scheme, not a Ponzi scheme or is that slanderous, no you slander a dead person.
There really is the product of gold toe socks(/≧▽≦)/~┴┴
Just listened to this on Spotify, hilarious.  Every podcast you guys are together my stomach hurts from laughing after
Bill and Dave Attell are Conan's best guests!
Burr should know Conan is a bit of a metrosexual
Too much cursing. It’s lazy.
Bill Burr is a legend
His third time on the podcast, my absolute favorite duo!!!!
after i watch.. i need to listen again to the podcast.. and i will feel alive again .. ty you conan
These guys have always worked well together because Bill is nicer than he seems and Conan is tougher than he seems.
i just listen today at work.. i am conan fan🤔😆
I'd become friends with a flat earther just to feed them information that eventually makes them believe the truth
I missed this.
Such a great duo. We need a movie from these two legends.
Hahahaha God dammit Bill.
Traditional dress shoes are not very comfortable so I fully support a rubber sole on a more dressy shoe.  Why suffer?
Is there a full video version?
I listen to this podcast and Bill’s Monday Morning Podcast regularly, quite a treat to see him on again!
My fav redhead duo.  Please, upload bit about the shingles
Love the chemistry here. Also - Bill has very good observational skills and listening skills. Most of the funny parts were prompted by him observing something most people would overlook, or noticing a tiny detail that was said...
He killed like 5 times in 5 minutes.
Bill Burr is literally Kratos
sounds like a ton of fake laughing
I think I own a pair of those shoes. Cole Haans.
