The Writer's Block sequel dropped today...and it's quite possibly Hunter's Magnum Opus.
BIG O BELLY, got my cracking up.
😭now what if YouTube themself seen this
It makes sense considering so many low effort, videos get tons of views and high effort videos don’t always take off because the amount of effort it takes to make them
c00lkid 1:22
Idea : did i just make the summer of the song!!!
The Crystal gems been real quiet since this dropped...
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT😂😂😂
2:19
Tan solo estoy en plena crisis mental y pasaba por aquí... Espero que MeatCanyon esté haciendo ya un video dedicado a The Amazing Digital Circus
Hahah 1:26
f u I wanted the Steven shit
😂😂😂
2:16 made me so uncomfortable I love it lmaooo
I’m too high for this
No wonder steven universe is PEAK
So what now
This is stupid. Your making kids shows in to adult anamation
Classic Tate W.
Thought this really was gonna be about Steven bummer
You ruined my sisters childhood..
Why does Chris Rock look like Principal Franklin from iCarly?😂
We will join you in this journey!!
He...did it to my favorite show?
"Im about to make your aaaaass as bare as herr heeEEAD!" XD
2:12 I mean that makes sense its harrasing
this guy enjoys staring at the abyss
LIAL GET DOWN THEY HIT THE PENTAGON!!!
It’s funny to me that he didn’t even draw himself normally lol
Need to know if meatcanyon is uncircumcised. I bet he isn’t very long but he is thick. And big balls
Schlatt??
MeatCanyon
What the Flip
JSchloogus McGoogus was mentioned
i expected jshlatt here
Please make the Steven universe one a full video.
2:13 “yeah….”
Who is Steve Universe? But, it’s funny. lol…..the Will Smith clip…gold!!!!! And the Neverending Story reference with the Yourube algorithm monster….someone pick Meat Canyon up please but no selling out for dough! 😂
where is  lapis peridot and the gem!? and connie bismith!! and spinel the diamonds!!!!!!!!!! and jasper!!!!!

as someone who loves this show… hoooo goodness
The belly look of the average American woman 0:03
What the fuck did you do to my favorite show
PLEASE MAKE A FULL VERSION OF THE STEVEN UNIVERSE THING 😢
I wish that video Will Smith spanking Chris Rock‘s ass was actual video by meat Canyon
Dude you just need 222k more likes on ur vid so it has 666k likes😭😭
It's understandable, I get having to feed the machine with content for cartoons can get stressful. Now he can just stream talking about random shit and pumping out a cartoon now and then.
Wow, this is the funniest thing I've seen on this channel. 🎉🎉🎉
i know this is old,  but why does the youtube algorithm monster give starscream vibes?
You should make a dragon ball on
STEVEN- 😧
is that a voice actor from arcane
Uh what?!
WTF
i love the end 💜
3:07 i love his cheering it’s so funny 😂
Oh my God, I love Steven universe. I was afraid you guys did one. I’m afraid.
as a steven universe fan this heavily is disturbing and makes me look at Steven another way 😭.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO not Steven universe
Best self promotion I have seen so far 😂
YouTube algorithm monster machine thing 😂💀
Coming back to this now just shows how great of a personality you really are, and yes, I'm calling you ugly.. I love you and your content, on all 3 channels I care about.. MeatCanyon, PapaMeat, and CreepCast.. Btw, bring back CreepTV, I miss it as YT subscriber scum clinging to your heel.. Pulling you back into the depths of unmonetized SLAVE LABOR FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT! Sorry, my mask slipped a little.. Please keep up the good work! *low whisper* Now imagine me as a still image cute anime school girl giving you a playful wink and kiss combo with a pretty flower filled background.. Please, Papa..
I will Join and sub two you❤
Someone from YouTube had to watch that
This has to be the happiest I’ve ever seen meatcanyon make draw anything 😂 3:11
Ugh❤
do i have hearing problem or youtube algorithm monster maching thing voice looks like the sun voice in solarballs?
Remember, if YouTube takes this down, it’s canon/ accurate
I wanna see schluttsack now
Wait you can do the sonic game of meat canyon
I always got the feeling Steven Universe was just a celebration of fatasses covered in queer-bait. But it wasn't until the fatass queers came out and turned against the show that I knew I was right 😂 I love people of all body types & sexual orientations. So please consider that in your snowflake reporting of my comment. 🤣
Daddies here😝😝😝‼️‼️‼️💕💕💕💕
Fizeram com o menino lá Que eles fizeram com o Steve não estou com medo já por que eu estou assistindo mas mas mas eu ainda vou assistir eu quero ver tu está acontecendo
Bro Steven’s 12
I wanted to see him rail the Youtube Monetization beast
Aw i wanted to see a ruby die
Im uncomfortable now
"TAKE MY HAND AND LETS FLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
very good video
I will
why... why steven universe...
Damn new otp ig
I love how the youtube algorithm monster is so jagged that any way you approach it it hurts you.
I don’t even think Steven has a fat belly in the show
So this is how Papa Meat started.
This wasn’t Steven universe. That’s annoying. Unsubscribing
I always wondered what up witht the second channel. Now I know?
I subscribe and join you!
Why does the algorithm sound like Crowler from Yu-Gi-Oh! GX?
Lol shhhhshhhshhh daddy's got you😂😂😂
What the fu-
That plot twist was insane
the   s q u e n c h    noise coming from Steven Universe's jewel is just awful for my eardrums
I reached out and never let go.   never..let..GO..
HOW dare you disrespect Steven universe fair Waring this is not to be taken serious this is a joke.
why is youtube worm is kinda
MYTAMMT
I love when he portrays YouTube as the villain
Meat canyon makes me want to be a YouTube algorithm ,. . . . so long as he keeps whispering those sweet nothings n my ear
This guy played with skill points and put them in Charisma for a while! 😅😂
I love this vid but like what was the storyline I don’t get it😭🙏
Hot dog
-FAT- FATTY✅️
I kind of feel click-baited ;(
"Mr.Youtubealgorithmmonstermachinething."  💀💀💀💀
The way he leans back and just stares into space after “Jschlatt tierlist video, but his sideburns are nutsacks.” Like, “am I really about to do this?”
Steven fell off
the evil mr youtube
As a Steven universe fan idk weather to be proud or scared
:( LMAO ugh nooo xD not steven!!
That magic "carpet" ride looked painful
ive seen this like threee times but its just so frreacking goofy bruh im laughing
You are unbelievably talented. The drawing/animating and the writing is top tier.

NO PLEASE... NOOOO ☹️☹️☹️😭😭😭😭

Be free, Danny McBride.
If I ever find out I have a terminal illness, I want a meat canyon animation of my last few fucks flying away.
15 seconds of steven universe and 3min of the best canon plot between papa meat and youtubes robot worm monster thingy. yay
😳
“I’ve been hurt before” 😂
the confidence to draw himself, knowing that it will be used as rule 34
man meatcanyon does a good voice impression of papa meat
That’s why I don’t want to be a YouTube creator community guides
😂🤣
This has nothing to do with Steven big belly💀
Was bro rizzing up YouTube 💀 2:08
Did him wrong💊😭😭
As a Steven universe fan THIS IS HORRID
"THIS IS AWESOME...THAT I HAVE TO DO THIS TO SURVIVE!"   Got me right in the feels.
Why is Mr Youtube Algorithm Monster Machine Thing so well animated lmao
papa meat riding youtube is the funniest shit ever.
I feel like I need to see the rest of where that Steven Universe parody was going. Maybe you can try again?
AND DRAW WIERD SHIT!
Is youtube algorithm your pet
Never ending story reference is great
i love steven universe, i would love you to actually make a steven universe robe, where they fuse into alexandrite and its jsut terrifying
Steven CaseOh

"Ok, one last video and I'll go to sleep"  The last video:
This went way to far                               Gay
All bout dat $$$!😂
I sent this to my friend who knows Steven universe.  I don’t think he wants to watch it anymore.
God this is the second time I've seen a hot version of YouTube. A worse version, but its hot.
this man makes me so uncomfortable 😭 post more
YouTube kids exist for a reason it’s for kids 😭💀
No one can beat the weirdness of MeatCanyon. How did he come up with that name anyway?
Did anybody else subscribe to Papa Meet and didn’t realize that was his second channel and was trying to figure out why there were two Youtubers using similar names?😂
Steven fused with yo mama
i loved this ;-;
Burn out is death  😂
I'M NEVER GOING TO BE THE SAME ANYMORE AFTER THIS WHAT THE HELL MAN DRINK SOME HOLY WATER
Yo meatcanyon, what the heck bro🤣🤣😭
Omg Steven univers
Love this man
I just found out today, that papa meat and meat canyon are the same person. 🤦🏻‍♀️
When you FINALLY REALIZE MeatCanyon is actually less INSANE than the REAL WORLD!
Veigar really switched up
WTF!?
“ I’m about to make your ass as bare as her head” is one of the hardest lines I’ve ever heard
“Hey, daddy did you wrong”
youtube algorithm out here lookin like a terraria boss
Youtube sounds like sundrop from fnaf
I used to watch this when I was younger and my mom said what the fuck are you watching
No I like the normal Steve universe
Steven ate the Universe?
Was that Zach Hadel as the YT monster???
God bless you sir god bless you

OKAY WERE JUST JUMPING STRAIGHT IN
YES, I WILL, I WILL JOIN YOU, love your vids 😂❤

Yeah, the bobbit worm video that went viral a year ago was disturbing. What is this world, when such creatures lurk at our beaches?
“And give me the stability to not put a gun in my mouth” I dont know why but this had me rolling and i feel bad for it 😩😂
NOOO NOT STEVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
clickbait
2:00 utube clips
hey daddy did you wrong ahahahahahha
The muse!
I wish I was this man's doctor
This foreshadowed his leave.
No my childhood its ruined!
love that "never ending story" reference.😊
ps. luv u :*
hope ur doing okay papa <3  you will come back…like a phoenix….RISEN FROM THE ASHES..STRONGER AND GREATER THAN ANY MORTAL CAN PERCEIVE
This video wasn’t about Stevens big belly is it?
foreshadowing
gyus gyus gyus he quit who would have known😉
This is a comment.
Steven Universe is Pedocoded trash
"Heavily" following trends....... I uhhh... I feel like I shouldn't comment anymore but yk, fk it.
He was dropping hints a year ago.
Came for Steven universe  Stayed for the second channel promotion
YouTube algorithm monster is very needy 😂.
In retrospect I wish this video took the direction of Evan Dorkin's Dork issue 7 where it starts like his ordinary material but then he quickly stops the plot and begins having a mental breakdown on the pages of the comic.
Gross
I love Meat
the Youtube worm demands more!!!!
this tracks with your recent video. hope you find your happiness again.
no
one of my favourite meatcanyon cartoons, and its mostly about Papa Meat himself lmao
Make one of caseoh
recibido ⁉️
came for the Universe, stayed for papameat lol

Side burns are nutsacks is killing me😂
I like how the end was like never ending story
Big offense I’m a Steven univers fan 😠
SCHLATT 🫶🫶🫶🫶
I’m scared 1:54
1:33
Thank God it broke the 4th wall and didn’t make it wierd..er than what he normally does.
youtube doesn't look that pretty, youtube is way scarier
1:19   DUdDE!!!!!!! tHats SureLy SoMetHing he M1ght D0
Why did I think he was Steven universes dad at first
Survival is it's own reward.  Usually.
So... Now you'll have the same issues in another channel as well, good luck =)
this is too good 😂
my followers decided your fursona is a buffalo
Love this?❤
Bro you are out of your fucking mind!!!🤣 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Papa meat makes the cartoons for us so he can pay his Bill's.
SU is and always has been a shitshow
I think he draws everyone extremely accurately except for himself. It doesn’t look like him at all.😊
I want my four goddamn seconds back right now and I want it now
The Devour of Gods
Ah man I thought he was gonna sex the YouTube worm :(
._. help.
Fuck way YT has changed I like how YT used to be
Bro he almost killed me with the neverending story shit!😂
howww do you get away with this lmaooooo
brah the giggle killed me XD ya got this my dude <3
Wtf
Meat Canyon is being threatened by the YouTube Algorithm, even with a monumental fortress of a channel.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love how he accepts criticism for leaning on odd sexual tension, then immediately falls back on it with the algorithm falcor lol

You sir, are a genius !!!
Not 5 seconds and i've lost all hope in getting my childhood back.           Jesse f-king Christ.
It doesn't have to be trendy! I think your best videos are where you turn old cartoons into something creepy, I honestly think this is where you shine and is your best work.
Yep he is defenetly loosing his minde
I love the Neverending Story reference xD
Was Scooby Doo getting jerked off by Shaggy there for a few seconds? Holy shit lol
I wanted to see more of Stevens big belly    :(
The end is clearly a Never Ending Story reference, with the music, the dragon... and i love it !
lol the reference to the never ending story at the end LETS FLY FALCOR
One of my goals in life is to make it big enough to be in a papameat video 😂😂
Kinda remind me of the Papa Meat guy
I love the whole adventure steven goes on in this one, its a masterpiece.
Not the never ending story reference 💀
Man, if he started spanking Chris that fallout would've went in a totally different direction 😅
Im a big steven universe fan and this made me feel wierd asf lol
He always succeeds in disgusting me
awww now do a youtube baby of the both of you.
“Daddy did you wrong”
Meatcanyon trying to rizz up youtube 💀
nooo not steven
why does youtube got the star scream voice?
HE GPT STEVEN  NPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The first thing that came to mind: jshlatt but his sideburns are nutsacks
"...It feels like odd sexual tension" "All right you got me there, I do fall back on that a lot" Proceeds to fall back on it with youtube machine
I thought his channel couldn’t get any worse,Steven universe is my favorite 💀
❤❤❤
I have never been more self concious of my stretch marks than I am seeing that thumnail
The algorithm is horrific
The way he calmly says “mr youtube algorithim monster machine thing” is so funny to me I quote it way to much
Your trying your best
As a steven universe fan..                    Wtf is that?!
Never ending storyyyyyyy
nine reference

Meatcanyon great job
this channel is crazy, i cant believe i just found it today, been binge watching for the past few hours. and theres a second channel too? nice
The will smith part could have been a video on its own 😂
0:06
If you ever revisit Steven Universe, horrorcore the hell out of "Giant Woman."
Thanks meatcanyon now i hate steven universe even more
we have the same sick twisted probably needs to go to a insane asylum mind
Do wild kratts
Meat we love you buddy, fuck being demonitized
This Man really tried to rizz up the YouTube Algorithm. The internet is a weeeeeeeeeird place
Should’ve watched this sooner lol
"Gordon Freeman what do you with our time machine." - Barney
Why did I think that the YT algorithm creature remind me of driller from Transformers DOTM
MeatCanyon I love you. Thank you for your creatively chaotic and beautiful brain
i actually started watching your 2nd channel first, didn't know it was related to this one until recently
I want you and Southpark to collaborate
I been hurt before ☠️
I know where that thing been.
Here’s an idea       Can’t believe I’m saying this        Skibidi toilets search it up meat I don’t want to explain
1:04 - 1:10 I need him
The ending looks a lot like fran bow, which could be just a falcor reference or it could be an intentional little jab at his sanity. Either way these animations are incredible
Now I kinda wanna cuddle the YouTube algorithm
Holy Neverending Story reference.
lol the Falkor ending 😂
I love how innocent he is "please giant YouTube amalgamation monster thingy please don't be mad at me".
this is every steven universe episode
You look a lot better than your animated animated counterpart.  Yea you’re a bigger guy but jesus you made your neck look like Nickacodo’s.
Wilbur soot and Tommy fighting
MeatCanyon for president 🫡 🫡 🫡 🫡
ga ngerti bahasa inggris/??????????????????????????????
I absolutely cannot get over how talented you are as an animator and at all the different art skills that go into these videos
this is just a beautiful masterpiece help
Am I the only only who said smash on the yt algorithm machine
Jschlatt got me fucked up
Why is YouTube acting like that
I’ve been avoiding this cause I love SU but it’s actually just funny
I love how he calls himself out for weird s3xual tension and then creates it with the yt algorithm
Meat Canyon is Kenny Powers.
But papa meat where are you and the algorithm going ..where you..Whe..WHERE THE FUCK YOU BITCHES GOIN'??? THE COMPUTER IS DOWN HERE!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yo who got the ice spice video? I need it 🥴🫠
why is youtve algorithm kinda
Mom, can we watch Steven universe?   Mom : no, sweetie we have Steven universe at home.    Steven universe at home:
lmfao
"and draw weird shit!" Got me LMAO
Wtf
Damn😢😢😂😂😂😂😅😅😂😢
😂😂😂Na na na na that ain't Steven universe thats Noah Galaxy😂😂😂
Meat canyon X YouTube Algorithm:
Did carlos voice will smith
Yeah it's pretty hard to make SU creepier than it already is.
*The following is the opinion of a Salty SEAGULL named EARL who just shows up in my posts whenever he feels like it, so don't take anything he says too seriously!* [EARL the Salty SEAGULL:] "You know I never thought I'd see such a wholesome Neverending Story style ending involving a YouTube Algorithm Monster Machine Thing & Meat Canyon! "
Make a video about Frankie Lepenna 😂
You did Steven wrong😂😂😂
🎉
This reminds me of my wife in a strange way.
That Steven definitelly is a sex offender
i love love LOVE how you talk about how you fall too much on sexual tension, and then pull a sexual tension scene again
* screams in the pillow*
I’m childhood is ruined!😭😭😭😭😭
0:38 I wonder what jschlatt  Has to say about this .,. His cheeks looks like balls 😨
What have done to my child hood show…
I kinda wanted to see the Steven universes vids 😭

You should do a Star Wars animation

I just wanted Steven universe ☹️
1:32 Will sounds like Jigsaw
Is everyone just going to ignore how good that youtube design is?
You should animate jerma
YouTube Algorithm x meatcanyeon pcorn release when?

Welp i now wanna lose weight

The youtube monster in this was done too nicely.  The real algorithm is more disgusting due to the leftists running everything.
meatcanyon x youtube algorithim
UNIVERSE 💀
Oh no not my childhood cartoon show
👍
can we agree that steven universe is a terrible show?
Steven one’s averse is the type of tomfoolerer to watch someone skin and eat a baby alive in front of him and say “you can change this isn’t you”
Wow, YouTuber buried this video for the longest time.
Nice 4th wall break of you animating you while animating
Youtubers his bitch
2:49 cc x vegeta f yeah!!

Can't tell if this is cringe content or king content. Hell, what do I care?! Feed me daddy!! 🥴
My childhood bro
I still want that steven universe video
Moderator Universe
.. "glad i have to do this to survive"
Why is the YouTube snake monster kinda hot?
No no no not Steven univers
I just got recommended this again, and I genuinely love how he’s self aware, but also aware of how he doesn’t give a shit of that fact
i always thought a crystal belly button to be weird, like in evolution was it some sort of parasite that crystalized
This is the only channel advertisement that has ever actually worked on me
bro got that youtube rizzz
😳
YES WE LOVE WEIRD SHIT!
And here I though that the best part of this video would be Steven's stretch marks😂
I think if you put the gun in you mouth thats will be batter for as 😂
love you
What th trick but also I’m addicted
តើ​នេះ​ជា​អ្វី?
I did not know meatcanyon as w Rizz😏
I just burst out laughing at 3am.  Cmon maaaaaan.

Let’s go😊
It sounds like Veigar from League Of Legends
So is monster lab shelved? It was actually good
Him doing this odd calming to YouTube the YouTube play button

"THAT IS TOO INAPPROPRIATE" Also yt: let's people upload there private parts on yt shorts -
Nikocado + Steven Fusion:Niken
love u meatcanyon
Papa Meat anything to keep the gun out of your mouth, we'll just have to replace it.... With something a little more fitting ;).   Seriously though, the Never Ending Story bit at the end had me in tears.
o the gun in mouth comment. hits on a few levels. existential dread, pressure, but also just feeling it as an artist, man....  (your second channel is dope, tho.)
the porn music was the killer for me cant breath lol
I saw it all and you ahould had made he got depression and  got super old becuase depression makes him older steven miss universe
the idea having a sexual relationship with the embodiment of youtube algoritm is why i follow this chanel
I wanted Steven Universe not Leonard Galaxy cluster 💀💀💀
Sorry for the dislike but it disgusted me and i hate steven universe
This video escalated VERY quickly 😂 Keep up the awesome work!
Well this might not make the Steven universe fandom mad lol
Little baby, likey~
Stevens whole mom could be stored in that belly.
WHAT THE FU## HAVE YOU DONE TO MY STEVEN UNIVERSE.  Also nice videos dude.
WTF
“ as bare as her HEAAAAAAD”😂😂😂
1:29 Genuinely, this is terrifying.
Youtube after that video: *DEMONITISE!*
FINALLY, someone draws stretch marks.
“I’m about to make your ass as bare as her _heeEEAD.”_
NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH THEY DID MY BOI STEVEN DIRTY!
0:06
There goes my childhood
Love the NeverEnding Story ref, there.
A lesson on art block
That wasn't Steven Universe that was Stephen Galaxy
What a goofy lil channel😁😁

C H E E S E  B U R G E R  B A C K P A C K
That Schlatt clip was my favorite piece of work from you
I LOVE HOW ITS SOOOOOOOO CURSED
My childhood. Is now terrifying and you have described YouTube amazingly
2:01 Look, Papa Meat has the rizz. I don't make the rules.
Their relationship aged well.

WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS😩
Do Tomas the train
ЕТЮБ САМАЯ КРУТАЯ ПРИЛОЖЕНИЕ
I love your design for YouTube it’s so cool :)))))))))
This should be called " the new channel"
This should be called 'losing ideas"
Cusi cusi cusi
“HEAVILY following trends!”   *Shows Nikocado response video*  AHHHHHHH! I get it!!! 😂
I hope YouTube sees this
I was gonna eat :(
YouTube as a Character is much nicer here than what other YouTubers portray them as.  But in the end, they are a Monstrous Supercomputer that leeches off of content and needs to demonetize anything that isn't "kid friendly" in their eyes.
And give me the stability to not put a gun in my mouth! Lmao
Ah yes my favorite meat canyon video THE ONE WHERE HE FUCKS THE YOUTUBE ALGORITHM
and steven?
Hi, MeatCanyon! I found you on CoryxKenshin's channel, and your videos are very entertaining! Very entertaining. Yes, I subscribed and watch videos. I enjoy your CONTENT.
Steven Avocado
Could you plzzz consider !! Doing one about dance moms
Nooooo Not ma boy Steven! 😫😫😫😫😫
Omg bro lmfaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
My favorite show Steven universe 😍
yeah ima sub this was great
For those who don't know, early in Papa Meat's career he was hounded constantly with comments about making a MeatCanyon Steven Universe, this was back when SU was at its pique popularity, but MC refused simply because he doesn't watch SU and had no interest in it.
Never have I ever been more intrigued by a middle aged white man with a mullet and  pregnant with a food baby *subscribed * p.s pls notice me papa 🥹
Mickey and Minnie but make a Sonic 1 Zen            Sauce
From another hunter you make me so proud to have the name
0:38 i’m scared
FALCORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR (Youtube Algorithm)
the times that are said daddy in this channel are insane
This aged well.
Something told me to watch a Meat Canyon video really quick. I'm glad I did.
YouTube design is unfairly cool
That was such an unhealthy relationship
Yes
🗿🍷
Real💀
Fucking amazing 😂😂😂
this is gold
Ridiculous, as always. Thank you.
Poor voice actors who have to play as them
Due to YouTube’s Community Guidelines I am forbidden from leaving the comment I wanted here..
You scare me

The man truly knows the grind.

Un-Friendly Kid show not for babies or small kids Un-Friendly just gotta dislike it its cursed
Fuck dude, this one hits deep
You know it's really heart warning someone just cares about YouTube Algorithm tm. She's been through a lot and it's just nice to see someone give her so much attention. She never really got it from her parents.
0:50 Tom kenny?
His laugh at the end made it a lot better lmao
When did you think of sideburn nutsacks
I love you meatCanyon ♥️🤎🤎
This Steven still looks better than the pilot version 💀
When steven universe became a pedo

I wanna fuck the Youtube algorithm machine thing
“Daddy did you wrong”  HE DID WHAT??
Like with lore and the whole meatcanyonverse
Dude please make a series.
the youtube algorithm demon thingy looks like the mechanical fabric snake thingy in the movie 9
What in the Never Ending Story is going on here!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Meta
I kinda wanted to see where the Steven universe arc was going to go
Dear reader of this comment, if you get a reply that says “congrats you won” or “message me on telegram” it’s a scam, there are thousands of different bots made by worthless human beings that impersonate popular YouTubers to steal YOUR info from a link, do NOT even click it. Real YouTubers have a checkmarked name, no emojis and do not say telegram in the name, please report anyone you see as have I too. They may reply to your comment in just a few minutes and even this one probably has one saying “cOnGrAtS mEsSaGe Me On TeLeGrAm” the internet is dangerous. Thank you for your patience fellow commenter :)
he phat
Meat canyon can sometimes. Make me feel uncomfortable😳
Why does jschlatt look like a Dr. Seuss character.
Shit now *this* is how you promote a second channel
Honestly when I saw this I was speechless like these balls
Looks likes a trailer park boy
Most beautiful advertisement ever
I like how he made YouTube algorithm his bitch 🤣🤣🤣
😳
Steven Universe in ultimate RTX 1080p HD PS5 ∞fps
When Steven Universe strokes his gem, I don’t know why but it’s satisfying. 💎

🤨
Okay but that YouTube monster makes an epic boss
Holy sh^* The representation of youtube as a demon is... too accurate, and then the sexy monolog. 🤌
“You got me there I fall back on that a lot”  proceeds to create sexual tension
average toxic relationship
I wish this was an actual Steven universe ep
Here's an idea i just thought of. Make a video about zach king trying to live his life normally without magic
The never ending story reference
Jschlatt but his side burns are ball sacks is hilarious
this was posted on my birthday. what. a. gift.
Man Steven universe is weird
Schlatt is beautiful

1:59 the youtube logo cuts over his face... it should.. ruined it for me, brought me back from intensity
Why the youtube algorithm monster machine thing kinda...
You know, isn't this basically what our first impression of the pilot was? Meat Canyon is just painting the truth here, guys. Peter Griffin style.
Wtf man, I click this video expecting a funny skit about Steven universe and I end up getting a video of you complaining. Wack
Meatcanyon lives in a house???
Why did he turn from the bitch to the daddy
I'm scared
surprised he hasn't parodied his fan base.
NO NOT STEVEN UNIVERSE!!
I’m happy that this isint some cursed Steven universe thing
Thats some funny' so powerful you can smell it from across the room.
*This one is his nightmare instead of ours, that's why its so much more funny.*
Unironically better than the real Steven Universe show.
steven universe was the limit even for him
Robot: *Sees this vid*  Robot: *Self Destruct sequence initiated*
Petition to make MeatCanyon create a full version of Will Smith spacking Chris Rock.
CUPHEAD PL NOW
The jschlatt part caused me to laugh so hard I shot a turd out on the shitter and splashed my cheeks ahahaha

Oh, this is so meta, and hilarious.
That's great. Youtube is a living beast 😂😂
3:13 looks like the og cartoon network cartoons like adventure time or amazing world of elmore or maybe uncle grampa lol, or is it just me?

This giving me the movie 9 vibes
Click bait
We need a full video on jshlatt he’s my favourite YouTuber that would be amazing
plss to the jshlat thing
thanks for the 16 seconds of steven universe :D
Ok, this was amazing, but I am disappointed this wasn’t an official Steven Universe video
So this is what getting high on LSD looks like
The neverending story bit made me so unbelievably happy lmaoo
fuckin great
Ahahaaaahaaaa!!! Love it.
This man scares me 😂 but I keep coming back
I love how it went from the disturbingly extenuated features of Steven Universe to a hardcore drug trip into a spin-off Never-ending Story
It's channels like this that make YouTube awesome. Great work "MeatCanyon".
WTF!?
this video was so unexpected but its so good
YouTube baby it's baby the kids not tik Tok it's kids to the among us
I'll big head
1:30  Somewhere out there, there's an alternate reality where this is what actually happened and now I'm sitting here wondering what life there is like...
0:48 best part
Realistic steven
meat canyon stop ruining my childhood
1:48
😐😬
"The way you did his voice and the pacing made it feel like odd sexual tension" "Yeah I fall back on that a lot" 6 seconds later: 2:00
This is the strangest yet scariest representation of the youtube algorithm made by an animator I've seen
*chefs kiss*
I'm in love with this ❤👍
oh god what has he done to my boy.
1:30 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭
Mad respect doing a video on burnout and then it being fucking well animated anyway
The neverending story finish lmao I loved it. Nostalgia.

😡😡😡😡😡
Never ending STORY
I promise you YouTube is very self-aware😂😂😂
The youtube  part got me dead😂 lol
"To survive"  --->  "To not get a real job" Nothing wrong with doing youtube in theory but you aren't obligated to do it and if you choose to do it full time, you kind of have to treat it like a job.
I find this very video wholesome. I teared up at the eeennndddiiinnnngggg....
Thanks I hate it
E
I need a video now!
Animation, voice overs, music, and most importantly the writing is soooo on point lol.  I would relate it to south park in how it takes it self seriously while at the same time being so ridiculous. Keep up
Papa meat X Youtube algorithm monster
You just re-uploaded steven universe this is not different at all:/
YouTube worm mech is best wife
Hear me out, you create something similar to inter dimensional cable
What the fuck
Hey, it's Ethan Ralph!
OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO STEVEN LMAO
._.
That youtube monster comes every day to me to harass me :( I haven't posted in like 3 days

"I'm glad I have to do this to survive!"
AHH I LOVE YOU! Never have I ever rave about a YouTube channel ,but man you’re so real and always serving up the things my brain craves. You’re humble and so honest haha. Never stop doing what makes you happy brother.

We have come for your nectar
The algorithm serpent looks like it belongs in Infinity Train.
Daddy did you wrong

Plot twist: the YouTube monster is real and none of this is a joke…
1:32 I know this voice.
“I fall back in that a lot you got me there” LOL
Bro why I'd you come for Steven universe why not make a weird Rick and Morty thing 😭😭✋

That little laugh in the end 🤣
I realy hoped it would be a steven universe sketch
It’s not my dream my god 😂
Nice Never Ending Story reference. Kinda fitting for the Steven Universe bit lol
I fucking LOVE this
He described YouTube perfectly
I can’t imagine what the other Gems would look like in this style.
Hunter looked like Steven Universe as a child
Do Clarence please 😂😂😂
oh
wow you are so funny
Mr YouTube algorithm monster machine thing literally sounds like Frieza from dragon Ball z
Brilliant
Why did you draw your self so handsome? Oh because your mmmm. Mmmm… ya… mmm
"I'm about to make your ass as bare as her head!" Holy shit that had me rolling lmao
Youtube forcing their workers to animate be like :
Meat has definitely done shrooms atleast once in his life 🧍🏾‍♂️w video
I like how he makes youtube as a giant mechanical beast
I didn’t like the Steven universe part cause I love the show but the rest I like cool stuff
You are a fucking weapon mate XD
Why Steven?
Dude I love your vids and DUDE DONT KILL YA SLEF WE ALL LOVE YOU MAN
How tf this got passed off
I’ve seen been seeing so many  of the youtubers in my feed  gravitate toward making  content that really inspires them glad to see you up to something new
This was posted on my birthday and I hate it. lmfao (I love it)
This has got to be the greatest promotion for a channel ive ever seen
I love how he gives up on the steven universe to embrace something...   MORE...
Don’t ever YouTuber have that YouTube or monsters scary thing
I will never watch Steven universe again :')
I thought this will be about Steven universe
The ultimate clickbait self promotion wombo combo OF AAAALLL TIIIIIME
@ 2:56 felt brother
Bruhhh what is this😂😂 definitely checking out that second channel
I want to die
i laughed at the way he was talking to youtube monster metal thing and jazz music starts playing
(Potential Spoilers)  The first thing he said was "oh yeah~"  Yep, safe enough to say the headphones are going in.
I’m not joining you until  You do a face reveal
Tiene estrias 0:10
Disgusting!
Omg lol
NO
0:39 JSHLATT!?
Really thought something else was gonna happen ngl
I am a steven universe HATER and I mainly hate this episode (just saw this episode.)
Lol the ending of the video got me real good. The entire video was gold, but as soon as it turned into an ad for your second channel I just started busted out laughing lol. Definitely turned into my favorite YouTube recently. Love your stuff and your sense of humor dude!
that ending fr hit
Please don't stop being yourself
The laugh at the end 🤣🤣
It's interesting different people come to the same idea about the visualization of *The Algorithm* . It's always some massive tentacled mechanical beast like something out of a nightmare
youtube algorithm looks like a terraria boss
I challenge people to watch all these while eating
NOoooooooo-! My childhood!!!-
This is a neat channel xD
Thank u for ruining my child everytime I click on one of ur videos, makes me regret wanting to live but in a good way because these animations are still amazing.
1:44 when he makes his character self aware
BTS
I f love this guy! I wish he was my brother, I swear!
Daddy done you wrong”  got me confused
RUN HES GONNA FUCK THE ALGORITHM!!!!
MeatCanyon, is it me, or is this video breaking the 4th wall?
It’s videos like this that distracts me from constantly thinking about dying
I love what you do, you wacky-hilarious-dude!!
"and give me the stability not to put a GUN in my mouth!"  I could not stop laughing
Ong they really did make us watch a show about a little boy who wears a rhinestone in his belly button.
Can u draw meeee! Or teach me how
YouTube: dance monkey dance Meat: only if you spank me first
I’m not gonna watch his second channel but this is the best thing I’ve seen in a while
I like that cut off to laughter it's almost like a Disney film
This man is a genius 🥲
Not everyone likes dark humor like this I personally love it, maybe they can respect the time and dedication and change etc. That you put into these videos and drawings. Regardless do what makes you happy too, take breaks focus on hobbies too bc even though you do something you love as a job it gets stressful really fast especially though YouTube and their restrictions 😕 Glad to hear you’re starting another channel where you show us some other personal interest, whether that’s skits or you’re hobbies. Whatever gives you that small break and sense of happiness do it! Bc Ik it’s hard to find light in the dark especially when you’re piled with work as in thinking of ideas to keep your videos and job bc you make money from this. Sorry for the paragraph I just really appreciate your work, reminds me of Brandon Rodgers dark humor 😂
Loved this
surprised he hasn't done the power rangers yet
Their lips bother me…
Can you please finish the Steven univers one. I hate that show and your version was hillarious.
Wtf
I appreciate everything you do thank you for all the laughs and odd sexual tension
Why not Steven Universe
Oh sh!t not again
Alf would be fun, him and his cat feasting or starving because they won't let him eat them.
🤖🌞💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟🌞🤖
JSchlatt was depicted perfectly, like the true bollock face he is
longest 3 minutes of my life
As soon as he said it I was like "this mfer" and then the absolute classic reference to end it 🥵
The fact I just started steven universe and I run into this…
Thank you for your channels. You truly are an original creator. Wonderful.
bruh i was excited for steven universe
Android Steven Universe with his big old belly and this ruined my childhood
I didn't expect "Schaltt" to be here
You Should make a diary of a wimpy kid video
I dig that sincere laugh at the end. You're doing good Papa
rubbing that gem and saying trouble is quite terrifying
I’m surprised there isn’t a South Park one yet lmao
Just found and binged a bunch of your videos. Got ur self a new viewer this is some of the most creative animation I’ve seen on YouTube
1:39 What he said?
This is legit an amazing ad.
Meatcanyon x Youtube ❤️
I really liked how you represented the YouTube Also I am subscribing  N o w

As sonic in AOSTH once said "oops there goes my childhood"
Wow this is his goofiest video yet
Make one about the lilo and stitch
rule 34 is gonna have a field day with that thing
Love it
Why do they have to have a sexual tone ???
Bruh f%$@ yeah im all for it, especially wooing the youtube algorithm death machine booty babe
was waiting for Steven to come fight youtube monster algorithm thing.
Cringe
"Big ol' belly"  -Fat Steven
Papa meat your guy looks like the dude from eastbound and down lmfao
If kizaru didn't smoke weed, have light powers, and had a baby with Steven universe
I absolutely LOVE the second channel, honestly enough even more than this one, and I would consider this channel a masterpiece! His personality is so addicting, if you're reading this and haven't seen it, I highly recommend you do!!
slay
I'll join u sure 😂
I think this is the best thing you’ve created and the irony isn’t lost on anyone
Ill know I found the one when they can handle PapaMeat
This what parents see when they see a youtuber
2:49
The whole irony about the Grammy scene is that what Will said is way worse than what Chris said 😆😆.
*Steven Universe's
“and give me the stability to not put a gun in my mouth” He sounded like a bobs burgers character
I dislike the fact that mestcanyon is presumably going to bang the youtube algorithm
With everything going on in the world plus the type of videos you make , you should never run out lmao
can you do gravity Falls? Hehe
Geez this broke the 5th wall🤣
2:20 to 3:20 one of the best minutes you could watch on the internet.
A very very cold ice bath
Damn could you imagine that thing screaming I'd ever YouTuber Mark apply her eat habanero peppers while sitting in this
One cannot defeat the algorithm, only split it into 3/3s with deathtouch and lifelink.
Steven stop pls
This was great!🤓
To be honest I’ve always wanted to see a guy put a gun in his mouth
What we really need is a new video platform. At least there we can enjoy freedom of speech for a little bit. Google is evil
1:22
I love how this shows how bad the algorithm is
I need more animated Meat Father
it is (surprisingly) fairly rare that i don't know what i just watched after a meat canyon video
Your a fuckin god
This could have been a masterpiece, that I could share with everyone, but you had to say Mr. YouTube algo monster?
This.... just this. Genius.
Is that oneyng as the YouTube algorithm
WHAT!!
I love the scoring of your videos!
The fact that you thought about animating that intro is a sin.
Wth did i just watch😂
How in the world can he paint his laptop with a  brush
wacho sos un genio saludos desde argentina segui asi.
This was a rollercoaster of emotions.
I like your videos💖💖💖💖💞💞
I think that MeatCanyon is loosing his sanity
Looks like Steven had way too much snack sushi
I LOVE THE NEVERENDING STORY END😭
Well that was depressing.
10% what's promised 90% shameless self-promotion 100% uncomfortable to watch
I'm just glad he didn't see me on the toi- wait what
This makes me fear for my life
How did he make Steven look like the son of sam
Why not make Steven universe 2 but the full thing
This isn’t just a vid it’s saying that we are PUSHING HIM TO DO VIDS and he gets demonetize
god i love u
😱( ⚈̥̥̥̥̥́⌢⚈̥̥̥̥̥̀)٩(๑꒦ິȏ꒦ິ๑)۶
You're so talented and creative. Great sense of humour too. That's why your fans are your fans! And that won't change just because your video output isn't as fast as the YouTube algorithm demands
Alternate title: Meatcanyon couldn't think of anything
Self-realization is a bitch. But on the other hand, you kind of a good artist, bro
Already have
ok
The concept of a physical manifestation of the YouTube algorithm may be the scariest creation that you've conceived, Papa Meat.
You nearly ruined my childhood with the Steven Universe one.
Sussy Baka
"Im about to make your ass as bare as her head" had me rolling, love it.
I will babe......let's fly!
1:33 the Oscar’s Will Smith slaps Chris Rock was deep Down Humorous 😂😂😂😂😂
Steven unicringe
You should work at adult swim
Yes
This is so meta
Lmaoooo Steven was clickbate love it tho 😭
i think thats a youtube hellion
"I've been hurt before..." 🤣
lmao jschlatt
Do one about Goldfish looking at humans through the glass please Iknow you would make it look amazing
Why does this scare me
THATS NOT HIM!!!!!!!!
We all love and hate you.
Oh thank God, Steven Universe is spared
*gets demonetized for copyright violation of YouTube symbol*
omg- I'm getting some serious uh....JUST WATCH 2:02
wtf its happening
do an ET one
"i fall back on that a lot"
My panini hurt
Damn I was really hoping meatcanyon was gonna fuck the YouTube algorithm I was half chub…
He should work at adult swim
you had me at Lewd Anime statues
You deserve a gumball for all your hard work
Are you tryna signal something?
I for one am a fan of the Jschlatt tier list idea
I hate how much steven from steven universe resembles me in this video
What the actual hell
Bro wtf
As a fan of the show I’m horrified and amazed.
I swear to god if you ruin my child hood by making the owl house like this-
"The way you did his voice and the pacing made it feel like odd sexual tension."  "Well that's true. I do fall back on that a lot, you got me there."   _Immediately falls back on it._  Laughed my ass off 😆
Big ole belly making me feel funny 🍆
I hated every minute of this
2:50 was this a joke or a cry for help?
thanks papito carne
This is probably the most sane and normal video MeatCanyon has ever made
YOU WILL LEAVE MY CHILDHOOD ALONE
if you ever get a biopic you BETTER demand Danny McBride as you, and then you can star as Danny McBrides stunt/body double.
This was absolutely an actual steven universe parody but it just wasn't working and then screw it just make it meta
yo that second NOW had me dying 💀
“Odd sexual tension” Im glad im not the only one😂😂
Unique video nothing terror
Steven universe creeper fan
This was a total bait and switch. A welcomed bait and switch
DMT?
You gotta appreciate Hunter's honest self-depiction in this video.
Wow that's a SECOND CHANNEL add right there best YouTube has ever seen
You can't force creativity. The algorithm makes us saturate every topic there is.
All smiles
YouTube was always the villain all along
Fucking love these.videos
I applauded this plug.
YouTube monster sounds like Oney, not gonna lie. lol
YouTube literally looks like the future version
The face of the oscars statues 1:36, great detail
🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:32  What did you say about Schlatt? 😂😂😂
lmao meatcanyon has a canon sexual relationship with youtube algorithm ;)
Wow
I haven't watched meat canyon in a while but god I hope he never goes the gun in mouth method, love the content!
I am confused
slepp with me pls
Why do I do this to myself.....
No
It’s crazy how quick you get these out. It’s like you’re actually able to make one every month. Probably the most productive animator here.
The YouTube thing sounds like the magical frog from adventure time
''Music>https://youtu.be/3eD_fbiUjH4
meat canyon loreeee!!!
Minecraft Fail walked so Meat Canyon could run
This vid never came up in my sub feed.
This might be the best channel announcement ever lmfao
Schlatt in a Meat Canyon Video? Awesome
Well it seems I need to go to the men in black. There's something's that I need to forget.
10/10 advertisement to get people to subscribe because it worked on me
a whole 6 percent of this video was steven universe
I’ve watched almost all of his animations. And this one makes me uncomfortable 😂
Falls back onto sexual tension after making a joke about how he always does that.
Man, the laughing at the end 😂😂😂😂😂😂
you really should probobly get a patrion
What even
You should do ben and holly, but ben has extremely long ears
You could make a video about Gatorade but it is Gatoraids.
Omfg I love this man's stuff so much🤣🤣
YouTube seeing this  👁️ 👁️     👄
Don t
I love how he didn't even change the title, it's like well I was going for that first but hey life changes 🤷‍♂️
If your comfortable watch meatcanyon ;-;
Nice cintiq! Personally I prefer the screen less type like the intuos pro line but to each their own
WHO voiced the YouTube machine
WHERE IS THE POOP MONSTER
subscribed
the MUSE is coming for you...
what about stiven ????
Shit this was relatable
Gumball
De unos minutos se volvio romantico hay dios mio ya se me hizo un ship WTF!!!!!! Ahhhhhh * desaparece en un segundo *
That do be YouTubes algorithms for ya
“Daddy did you wrong” YouTube: “Yeah?🥺”
Music 2:07?
Great...  He ruined my favorite childhood cartoon character and my mental mind is broken
I love the neverending story reference
The jab towards YouTube is fantastic your the king meat canyon
I want to see where this Steven Universe thing goes
Vid was a w
The YouTube centipede thing was awesome. The way each part moves is just nice to look at. Amazing job as always
Please do more. We need this else we DIE.
00:09 This is exactly what he does in Multiversus, it's fuckin creepy dude
Lewd anime statues
YouTube voies like bill chiy
Too freaking hilarious!
Disgusting
Dat was so gross man how do you make this ugly stupid stuff with steven
Yes I will
Steven universe should be actually animated here but it was a good every other bit spot on with your life😂
“I fall back on that a lot, you got me there.”  *falls back on it immediately*
I kinda want to see a full Steven universe one now, the way he said “I think I might be looking for some trouble” is a Cliff hanger
I feel like the Will Smith-Chris Rock spanking scenario would’ve been good
As long as you don’t touch the amazing world of gumball we good
I like even MeatCanyon doesn't want to make a funny with SU its too easy.
Ok DADDY
0:21 Exodus 20:7: “You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
>SU content >20 sec worth  how do you run out of material for that? this is the equivalent of taking a proclaimed detour then it leads to driving off a bridge
The video "Make Up" brought me to this channel and now I never want to leave
the animation quality is amazing tho
No..... NO.... NOOOOO
He hit everybody's childhood all the way back from the '80s to today in this one
Daddy did you wrong... Lol
Ok
I literally have to subscribe
please god no
Oddly enough thank u this is helping me through a rough spot :3
The reason why This video isn’t much about Steven Universe parody because it’s already horrible and dark and scary on Cartoon Network
Damn, why'd i get turned on by the way he spoke to youtube algorithm 🤔
“Your sweet nectar, I NEED IT!”
the fact the the inappropriate  things  said  a kid might watch it and that would be bad but its your channel so
They neverending story reference at the end tied it altogether.
Meat canyon, you're fucking weird. But that's why I'm subscribed
I have to do this to *SURVIIIIIVE!!!* 🤣🤣🤣😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭
This video was not what I was expecting but I love it anyway
We need to report this as sexual behaviour Just to make the youtube employees watch it.
You should do a teenage mutant ninja turtles one
the loud house
this just litterally looks like a normal Steven Cringeverse episode to be honest
fraud alert uber eats will only refund a few order if there's any problems after that they just keep your money even if your order didn't arrive !!!!! they are just trying to get people to use the app then taking order here and there. getting the money for your order plus the order it self. uber eatss
That is awesome
I didnt know the youtube algorithm was Apep the god of chaos.
How did this turn out like this
I smell some serious daddy issues
ill go anywhere you want, papa meat
Fk
There goes my childhood
ay yo?
steven plays way to much league of legends XD
yyyyeeeeeesss papa meaaaaaaattttt
Did-  Did meat canyon just seduce a robot worm youtube algorithm?
Tbh  YouTube robo snake I Want one
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
How did the "Annoying Orange" get a TV show and not this guy? His Youtube show is way more popular and actually funny. I'd watch this all the time. This guy's cartoons is funnier than Rick and Morty. Feels adult swim, but the good cartoon network  at the same time. A little Ren and Stimpy as well
i was scarewd to watch this because of steven universe
I hate you for ruining one of my favorite shows.
Hunter has a weird facination with testicles being in places they shouldn't be.
I might actually watch Steven universe now
Ugh he the best at drawing
nightmareeuhehunjuieu
Big juicy beefy yes yus humongous 10/10  Swag Swag sWag SwaG
Accurate
You're doing good work meat man
God this shit is uncomfortable and hilarious at the same time everytime i watch one of these
Turn around and look at what seeee-e-e-e-e-e-eeeee!!!
0:01 that's how long it took to ruin my entire childhood one second, thank you meat canyon for ruining my childhood :').
This One Is Good.
Youtube Algorithm.... Best Girl?
You've ruined my favorite cartoon, thank you. (No sarcasm, it was great.)
Honestly, compelling.
Bruh like only 1 minute of this vid was Steven universe
He even makes just a plug to his second channel entertaining
Genius
Do amber turd
Bruh
Steven looks like a discord mod
Oo
Smooth Segway to the second channel, already subscribed 😂
“Daddy did you wrong”
Just started it and chuckled at how Steven has the striae that comes from the Cushing's Syndrome.
the never ending story??? iconic
I remembered Steven universe my old child hood
This is messed up but i love it 😃🤣
These disturbing videos make me want to put a gun in my mouth
SUAAAAAAAAAAAUSE
If any of us stop working even for a moment we'll be killed. That's the promise of modern living.
When YouTube came up to confront him it was the best because it was basically like everybody telling him to do more✨
My childhood is destroyed
Would you ever consider finishing the Steven Universe segment? 👀 Srsly I'll eat up anything you make
Stretch mark belly.
Hey meatcanyon👁… uncle grandpa? Can you ruin that for me🙂
YouTube the killer of creativity
should have been bugs bunny and chris rock lol
This is actually kinda deep. I remember in his live & on his Instagram he’s been getting burnt out with everything and that he is due for much needed breaks. I hope you take the break you need meatcanyon. I’ve been a loyal fan for a long time!!!
“That’s too inappropriate “   NO IT AINT…😈..CONTINUE
MEAT CANYON RUINS EVERYTHING!!!!
This video was fucking hilarious
How about a beavis and buthead one?
Oh fuck i knew you were gonna do steven universe 💀
God damb it he ruined another one of my favourites
Where is the Jschlatt comment
So no Steven Universe? 🙁
you cant even put "Steven and his body fat" in a prison system. its a switch.
it has a lot to do with steven and his weight, theirs really this black and yellow ant! it can switch people out from their bodys if they dont pick up level T, i picked up level T.
i wont join the united states marines.
some children dont want to join the military.
Holy shit this makes me uncomfortable and I love it
IM GLAD I HAVE TO DO THIS TO SURVIVE!!!!!!!!!!
3:10 at this moment I knew a happy ending would be to good to be true
MetaCanyon
B r u h .
I will follow you to the ends of the earth
naw not schlack 😭😭
I do honestly wanna see that Tier list with Jschlatt just because it would like someone you would do.
aware
Fucking brilliant mate!! 😂😂
You should make a cartoon of asmongold reacting to the Johnny Depp amber heard trial... I know you would make a masterpiece... I know you will understand if you watch. If you do, shout me out... I got less than 10 subscribers cuz im a crack whore.. not really.  Im just a fuckin procrastination in human form.
This is uncomfortable. The 1st part
Little did he know that I already got his second channel on my recommended page ages ago..
Thank you, Meat, you make my crippled existence less depressing, and miserable. You're the best, and I'm always looking forward to your next video.
Chris is the YouTube voice isn't he
Im drunk while watching this, everything changed so fast.. 😅
Meatcanyon and YouTube
steven universe has been ruined for me now
Aw man I was so glad for the Steven Universe's video That was great af tho, good to hear you're expanding!
Shall I docome it
NAW YOU DID JSCHLATT WRONG 🤣
Love the homage to the neverending story 😂
The Power to recharge and Bounce back faster OPPO A96 Designed to charge faster  edit: wrong channel my bad
How hid he seduce the YT algorithm
Best advertisement I've ever seen
This explains me.

Pappa Meat giving us that protein
I wanted to see him bang YouTube
That is not a healthy relationship...
Rose/pink diamond : why did I create U
LMFAO 😂😂❤❤😂😂
mhhhh
mhhhh
The honesty in this video masked by sarcasm... #chefkiss 👄🤌
the sexual tension in this video is gonna lead to R34 involving meatcanyon and the youtube algorithm
Its like its Hard to Make Things Creepy
Imagine crying about the YOUTUBE ALGORITHIM, when you have over a million subs and can literally do anything you want and get paid on patreon and sell merch. It's so pathetic. Just make cartoons and stop bitching........
🤣
Send me a gift card you know you want too
Love you man, lol.
Nice
meatcanyon your awesome, your animations are funny and creepy, honestly the only animation i want a fan of of yours in blues clues, just because it was depressing, but outside of that singular one, your amazing!
why do i love the idea of the Youtube Algorithm being just an insecure oppressor
Never knew how much Meatcanyon looks like Steven Universe until now.
spongebob quote this is disgusting
I fucking love this dude…..no homo
1:38 "I'm about to make your ass as bear as her head" best line from the oscars
Thank god the steven universe part was dropped that show doesn't deserve your take papameat
Admits to using odd sexual tension in video then immediately goes onto using odd sexual tension 😂😂😂 love MeatCanyon
this feels exactly how ERB felt when they made their second youtube channel and mentioned it in a song lool. nicepeter vs epicloyd xD
I want YouTube robot centipede to be my baby
thanks for ruining my childhood
people got baited just for meatcanyon to promote his second channel, god I love this lmao. 12 y/o me can go pee himself for shitting this channel because he got traumatized lol
thank you, for your amazing videos, and showing me things i wont ever unseen. real talk though your awesome, and like your videos always cheer me up.
ill admit, it took me a sec to click on this abomination
Thats too bad, Im already subscribed to it, sucks to suck
give me shameless self advertisement except that it's done well  perfect
Honestly J schlatt with nuts for sideburns is pretty amazing actually
I’m actually gonna cry this is one of the ones that personality hurts
what the heck did i just witness
I really love the direction this video took.
the end with "never Ending story " reference was epic. i felt the melody
when did Steven become Ethan Ralph?
I heard what u said to my wife bruh😂
My mind is fuck from watching meat canyon
O_O
Mr. Youtube Algorithm Monster Machine thing 😍🥴🥴🥰😍😘
You forgot to mention the copyright abuse on YouTube.
Aint gone lie. That will smith bit had me laughing
Was pretty good. But there was odd sexual tension towards the end of the video. You seem to fall back on it a lot.
This is some dark yet absolutely  hilarious realism 😅😂😂
Ya YouTube is like that
what did this have to do wit this universe nd steven 😂
He looks like niko avocado
Yo what the
https://youtu.be/VipmHNEoOcQ
Meatcanyon is way ahead💯
Now kids... You see.. THAT! THATS HOW YOU ADVERTISE A SECOND CHANNEL
I love the never ending story reference at the end haha, keep it up PapaMeat
Writers block is one of the worst things to experience
Breaking the fourth wall be like
I got dis BIG OL’ BELLY…
Think I might trying to sniff out some trouble 😂😂😂
If there was anyone who can smoothtalk an enormous metal Youtube monster snake, it certainly would be you.
2:45 2ow amazing
The voice mr youtube jaaj
0:58 youtube XD
0:16 XD
I'm surprised he hasn't done an angry birds episode, I imagine it being brutal
Wtf
when the youtube algorithm death machine said "yeah?" i lost it
Finally Gordo mamón the true secuel
1:36 genuinley on of his funniest ideas and best Will Smith Oscar joke is Will bending Chris over his knee and spanking him
Meatcanyon styled Meatcanyon looks awesome
I actually loved the will smith bit lmao
This is like what Meatcanyon sees And what we see
I'm still watching this shit Meat Canyon. Every fucking skit on here is gold dude. I wanna see that full tier list video dude. The double nutsack sideburns? Bro. That shit is fucking clever.
I would love to see more of the YouTube algorithm monster machine thing. Such a lovable character.
What did I just watch?!?
Yooo
...scariest thing about this is how true it is
THE FUCKING STRETCH MARKS *AAAAAAAAAAA*
My ear they burn
Steven universe bad
disgusting
0:35 , 1:22 ^ Bro what🤣
Meatcanyon is bad
Yo it's orlin
The ending is such gold 🥇
I've never thought about how the YouTube Algorithm sounds, but honestly, y'all got it spot on.
This YouTube algorithm character makes for an interesting love interest for our protagonist Meaty.
Never ending story reference, lol
0:30: Love the 4th wall break. I also love the fact that this was all just a self- promotion for his second YouTube channel, Papa Meat. 😆
i love it
YouTube headquarters knows this guy is creepy
-Bromance unlocked-
You could make one on South Park
Honestly i don't give a crap about trending content, is an ugly industry that need collective obsession to be kept alive. But i will stay here daddy
lmao that is a perfect representation of youtube's algorithm right there XD
This is so disturbing at first lol
Seems like the comment I made on the regular show one finally came true
2:50 Um.
2:01 -that youtube lady needs to see this
Never thought I would see a Never ending story reference. Love that movie.
Nice representation of YouTube it's fitting
That final giggle really got me
How about a collab with Ice Nine Kills to make an animated music video based on Farewell II the Flesh? that will be awesome
So glad you didn’t disrespect Steven Universe!
OMG NO WHYY--
Schnuts
I'm lmmfaoooo
I’ve waited 3 weeks because I was terrified as to what monstrous violation of my mind this video would be but thank god it’s just a promo for your second channel. I can’t handle another Winnie the Pooh esq. video, I’d physically melt
Not gonna lie, you say you can't think of anything and then you just put out the absolute gem that is your Family Guy video. If this isn't you at your best, all I gotta say is that your talent is truly amazing.
I’m so glad MeatCanyon is just screwing around with his job, it makes it just way more funnier and realistic. Thanks meat for for this sweet nectar
Animation is coming back to YouTube better than ever
U should make a video about the amazing world of gumball, that would be awesome
3:10😂😂
Yoo meat cannon funny video snd jokes aside fuxk youtube man we will always have your back
the most normal video on this channel
Youtube is a bitch.
Naming this the Steven universe sketch was genius because it caught me off guard to see actual meat canyon
The true never ending story
why does the youtube moster remind me of dreamXD
Woah your entire channel is just wow
so he made a video about Youtube getting hoed by MeatCanyon :skull:
MEATCANYON U SHOULD send MORE VIDEOS TOO CORY

Awesome Hunter keeps it up we all love ur stuff ;3
Bro what am I watching searched for Transformers and this came up 🤨

God that chuckle at the end, that's how you know a voice actor is either having a lot of fun, or trying to hide their internal dread.
Stop man you ruining everything
Ye
Imagine if he made a ren and stimpy lmao
Steven Universe reminds me of Ron Jeremy bro!!!

I’m know this is gonna ruin my hero academia for me, but I’m curious to see how you would make it.
Well, at least that was constantly weird.

Meatcanyon you gotta do animaniacs!
MeatCanyon puts the "demon" in demonetization.

Can you imagine Meatcanyon if he would animate a parody of 'The Brothers Grunt' - made by the same guy who did Ed Edd n Eddy, it would make sense considering that his style is disturbing in a good way and could perhaps redeem the shows reputation in a new light.   Plus it might be a new idea to share for our Papa meat, your welcome! ✌👹🤙
Sounds like somebody is getting greedy
What did I watch
Make one about jojo's bizarre adventure
Brilliant
You get me, let’s rock.
No~ 🙃
I never imagine you made second wholesome animation we can see..
He’s really trying to… we’ll I don’t know. I saw this when I was in a rewatch of Steven Universe
Can you do some Ford ad with horny and sexy voice
I always felt like it was inevitable that MC would make a cartoon about himself having to make videos making weird parodies of people and cartoons.  This was surprisingly close to what I imagined it would go down like.
YES PAPA MEAT
But Meat, I already watch the second channel!
mr.pickles vibes hoe
Hahaha
Not once have I EVER commented on or hit the like button for anything that has ever been posted to YouTube.... But this guy... I just don't even have words that can properly describe the grotesque fucked up hilarious shit he creates... It is probably the best worst content on YouTube... And it... is... fucking glorious...
This really reminds me of Rick and morty humor😂
Meatcanyon can you please do a Gordon Ramsay one
Oreo copied off hydrox
This is ens of this Channel :(
when Youtube said I've been hurt before he sounded like Herbert the Pervert
you should do how ridiculous
Really Good Interesting Cartoon, but I seriously laughed at that Will Smith Part XD
Yaaaaa
You should do a hello kitty one
ok that youtube monster design is sick af
I never understood the having multiple channels shit.  Just put everything on the one channel.  Who cares?
Nobody:  The pilot: 0:00
there are so many things i hate about this but i couldn't stop watching....
Man I wonder what the symbolism behind this video is.
i like neverending story ending.
Yeah ok but we kinda want the end of that steven universe plot. I wanna know what trouble he's gonna find
*I WILL!!!!!*
That was a very good steven universe video. Yes indeed.
YES SECOND CHANNEL
Was not expecting this, fuckin great
Teratophilia.
Do one on bryce hall please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Would't you mak3 mor3 profits if you host3d your own sit3 to k33p alllll th3 mon3y from th3 ads?
Not Falkor!
This goes for everyone: Remember to take a break every once in a while
Video.
No
This guy is carrying YouTube for me.
Lol I love meat canyon
Make a video on amber Heard NOW
Make a video on the amber heard case, it would be a banger
Just the Will Smith joke had me cracking!🤣
Jajaja i love this 😂
This is not something u watch by yourself u either watch wit other people or u watch someone reacting to it
Bruh the “that’s true I fall back on that a lot” fucking got me dead
What the fuck
nah
lets move to Rumble!!!
Millions of things and u can't come up with anything?
Dude created a second channel just he could make an animation of himself fking a robot centipede.    Nice.
I just watched the entirety of a clickbait video
this shows that he needs a break, but YouTube won't let him....duh
What is wrong with you.
please do dhar mann
This is the best channel ad I’ve ever seen lololol
Was this a fuckin ad?
It’s the song MAGIC by B.O.B but Rivers Cuomo found the magic baby
"I've been hurt before" sounded so much like Matt Watson I laughed so hard
°-° What the fuck?
THEY BROUGHT STEVEN INTO THIS NOW!?!?
Ok but Jschlatt with balls instead of sideburns on the side of his face is amazing
The youtube algorithim monster machine thing makes me think of a monster from the movie 9
im confused, is this us, the company youtube, or both?
=YUP,PERFECTLY UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION..............  =BUT THE REAL THING HERE NOT ABOUT THE DEMAND,BUT ABOUT CRITICIZING TO SHOW WHAT'S HIDDEN TO BECOME BETTER SELF,SORT OF.......BECAUSE OF THE PERFECTION IS ALWAYS TO BE ADORED ABOUT TO IT LOOK LIKE NATURAL,LIKE ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY
Im confused, why doesn’t he just put the cartoons on this channel if he’s just gonna do that on the second one?
God you're fucking funny.
Wtf did I watch
meatcanyon used to be funny but now it's just cringe
Holy shit ending it like the Neverending Story was fucking genius.
He got the ending of this from Rick and morty
This is someone fetish.
Ur the only creator that's allowed to post once every 2 months imo
Lmaooo this was all just to promote his second channel
That Guy looks like he has lumps of Balls in his chin
En Español
Please continue with this great work. i like your video. Wishing you health and success 🥰
Why am I watching this why eating Burger King? 😂😭
STEVEN WHAT THE FUCK?!
just realized this was made on my birthday
@meatcanyon  you should include Braco in one of your skits!!
This is the most high effort request to subscribe to a second channel I’ve ever seen. I’m sold.
Bro please hire siah the clown he has the perfect voice
No offense to meatcanyon, you’re an amazing artist. I’m just not sure how my friends always say that they’re gonna go home and just binge-watch you and are still sane.
God in all the years I’ve watched this channel it just gets better. Love it
Hey, can you say “on god” in your acting voice
I thought that was Bobby Lee...
🤣😂
Never fails to make my friends cringe
🙁💀
Oh my god steven you monster
Shit im already subbed
2:02 yes, he does fall back a lot to sexual tensions
I love meat's laughter. It sounds like you're tickling him.
This is so good.
Love both channels. But why not post the same content on the same channel?
Idk whats more surprising how a thumnail of steven universe can get to 2.4 mil views, or the fact that MeatCanyon has the balls to fight them head on.
😐
make a chowder one
Your work reminds me of the British comedy series, Monkey Dust. It’s very dark, surreal, satirical and dystopian.  Your minion cartoon was bittersweet and quite moving.
The YouTube algorithm robot: “YeAH?
I mean. Cover the Depp v Heard court case or maybe just do one over internet cat videos, or like the lifespan of memes. Stay up till like 2am drinking mountain dew and watching comedies from like 60 years ago - I am sure something old can be new again if your sleepy enough.
He should have had will pull chris pants down🤣
Its crazy how he wanted to use this channel to have fun but now has to make a second channel to have fun
Hah, hope you feel good man
I LITTERALLY HAD WILL SMITH IN MY MIND
Jesus christ lol
Top 10 plot twists of all time
Do one for amber heard 🤣🤣🤣
😂
why use steven universe for clickbait? LOL
MAKE AN AMBER HEARD JOHNNY DEPP VIDEO
Bro, please do an ep of Brenden Shcwaub "apologizing" to Bobby Lee.  https://youtu.be/reOKQ84Dspo  Best subject since Nikocado
𝚆𝚑𝚊𝚝 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚎
No wonder my favorite YouTubers, especially story time animators, are leaving YouTube for sites like Curiosity Steam……….
NO NO NOT STEVEN
If you convinced the youtube algorithm, then you can convince anyone including me ☺️
Absolutely perfect
He’s got Rick and morty interdimensional cable energy
wow neverending story reference nice
OH NO
Man's really blew up lately glad to see it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love you. You dont have to do this to survive. Unfortunately it's the best option right now cause reality sucks but you have a beautiful talent and it helps people become comfortable with the darkness. Just dont let the darkness consume you while being the light that guides us through it. I love you hunter. You're not just meatcanyon or papa meat. Youre you and yoire fuckin awesome bro. Super cringy I love it. Hopefully i can throw you some ideas in the future to help feed the machine. Lol.
The Jschlatt killed me 😂😂
THAT WAS SO UNEXPECTED HAHAHA
I was subbed to papa meat the whole time not meat canyon the heck
Schlatt with nutsack side burns was something I didn’t know I needed 😂
💩 ew
This video is Fukn phenomenal 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
1:21
reminds me of a sentinel from the matrix
This is pretty cursed
The Never Ending Story reference
coryxkenshin should react to this
Idk but having YouTube being this mech monster that’s fucking scary at first, but then just suddenly becomes submissive it’s one of the most funny/weirdest things I’ve ever seen on this platform. Props to meatcaynon for the amazing artwork in this video!
Dude said he falls a lot on that
Bro you can’t be drawing yourself like that. You’re boutta make me act up.
I hated how realistic to the actual show the gem was
Let me ask you something, why would you need a second YouTube channel when you could put all the stuff the second channel has on this one?
This has been long overdue…
The Youtube OvElOrDs
I thought this was a SFO vid until I noticed the iconic MeatCanyon pink and yellow.
Meatcanyons should curse game theory, I imagine he could turn it so dark lmao
Jajajaja is funny that nobody likes that fatty frog with the jem in his belly! Also  excellent animation!
Ok so Jschlatt did do a coolie tier list video, but he never put a chips ahoy one in the A tier. So how did Papa Meat get the accent? Very nice
i fucking love this dude.
Can u make a eugenia cooney one?
It fucking scares me but it’s beautiful
THE SCHLAAT ONE PFFT
PLEASE DO A FORGED IN FIRE SKIT.
Hi MeatCanyon! I've been a long time subscriber and fan! Absolutely love your cartoons! I think they rock! I was wondering if you have thought about creating a cartoon about the three-ringed circus freakshow of a court case starring Depp & Heard? I think it would be awesome! I was also thinking how kool it would be if Celebrity Death Match would create a 'Dopey Depp vs. Heard the Turd' show/video! Maybe that's something to think about? Anyways, just wanted to say 'Hi!' Much ✌ Love ✌ From ✌ Ottawa, Ontario! 🇨🇦
2:54
Bro I'm way too baked for this thank you papa meat
Well done
0:19💀
"Gun in the mouth" "Glad I have to do this to survive"...those lines had me laughing hard
I demand you make a toon about Jonny Depp and the slimy snake
DUDE HOW DO YOU DO THIS I GOTTA KNOW!!*incredible gift but I think your using it the wrong way but hey you do you*
Can any artist make r34 of MeatCanyon and the YouTube algorithm monster?

Very funy video
Wtf did I just watch💀 I don't know how to feel about this video. Its funny but so confusingly weird
This video makes me feel like I need a shower after watching it.
Nothing wrong with having a lil junk in the trunk
i wish i never saw that 💀
Legit youtube worm sounded like Starscream
Why does the youtube worm frickin terraria destroyer lookin thing sound like Queen Entazoa from Wander Over Yonder
Is that a how to train your dragon reference
1:55 shit got real
At some point I'd like to see some kind of Meatcanyon/Explosm Entertainment collaboration. You two seem to have similarly disturbing humor.
Reminds me of yu gi oh with the friendship thing XD
this is somehow the least disturbing video hes ever made
wtf
Imagine he does a video on paw patrol
I heard what you said about my wife...
NOOO MY CHILDHOOF
I cannot stand Steven’s voice and it really sucks because Steven Universe is a great show. But I’ll be watching it and cringing my way through the whole thing.
This.... this is a masterpiece. We must place it in the Hallowed Halls of Legend for all to see and preserve it for future generations.... should they prove worthy of such majesty.
He should do DanTDM next or gumball
Wtf did i just watch....
Que arte 👏👏
...is that Kim Jong un?
Was that tomar
No
XD I wasn't not expecting this at all. This is probably the first thing I have seen of his with a happy ending. And the jab at youtube. Very bold.
You should post the will Smith video
do one about jelly bean
I friggin love you man 😂
Dadameaty left me unspokenu
Ok ✍🏻🤝
NO MY CHILDHOOD
À então oq vc faz é monte de animação amentrondatoras  é pra compensar tu faz algo muito bonito uma semana depôs
We DO need your sweet sweet nectar tho Papa Meat.
This is one I cannot watch.
Do one about beauty and the beast!!!
do jay leno!
I am scared.
My precious show😭😭
I literally hate algorithm
PLEASE DO A FAMILY GUY ONE!!
I thought I was going to watch the creepiest episode of Steven Universe. Then I thought I was going to watch Will Smith gone sexual and then it turned into........something.
Look meat I know youve made it big now, but masking your laziness with "running out of ideas" is gonna be your downfall
Can you make an animation about the Learn With Pibby corruption
Bro imagine if YouTube commented on this
That was realy good
Boost this
"How does your belief that 'pangaea' was a 20 sided ceramic construct... Relate to the modern world in any meaningful way?"  Great question.  For one, xx Chromosome women are the living result of the heaven breaking machine operating unchecked for over 2000 years.    They influence iron in soil to drive angelic beings to kneel before them as husbands, which is a position only PLANTLIFE are supposed to be in.  It goes much deeper, but that one detail tells an educated universe all it needs to know.  The only way to change womanhood is to give them self awareness down to the molecular level.  All attempts to change the abusive mindset of womanhood have failed this far, because the LIGHT did not know that it was dealing with a ceramic Heaven-breaking machine, and it did not pressure women with self awareness based on their position on the throne of the Heaven-breaking machine.  .  Additionally, it lets the Heaven culture understand what it's dealing with here, which has the effect of solving the skin color racism until silica participates in 'Angels or plants', and iron has ESTABLISHED a clear pathway based on BEHAVIOR, to earn xx female influence naturally.  The PROBLEM with the current fair wifu supremacy is that is supposed to be something EARNED thru service to PLANTLIFE, and it's NOT like that at all on this planet.  So the wildlife that should have been able to earn advanced evolution into full personhood... Have not.  The men that women enslave commit terrible horror on livestock animals that are held captive from birth until their murder, which is an ultimate form of punching down at the less fortunate.  That's the real racism that women are benefiting from, but largely ignore about their own race.  ❤️
Yo amazing
I love this strange "YouTube algorithm" creature, this mechanical insect serpent thing. I NEED MORE
bro my childhood
I'm fallow both channels meats. You make awesome content don't ever feel like you need quantity over quality
Why are you making everything look like some crackhead hallucination?
Just take my soul
What in the fuck did I just watch
yawl sould make a Pingu animation
Love how be made a parody of this show with the idiotic ass fanbase
NO
…………
Oh god why'd you have to ruin Steven universe but hey great vid tho
It's great seeing how your animation has continued to improve. Your team did a great job, this was the best second channel promotion vid I've ever seen!
As usual... your animations are absolutely vile and ridiculous.             God bless you. <3
Pokémon eh the title could Be I’VE LITERALLY CAUGHT THEM ALL
Oreo's suck and taste like charcoal and crisco cookies, fight me.
Impossible Whoppers are fucking amazing, not going to lie.  I ordered one 4 days ago with cheese and bacon and it was absolutely amazing.  How in the hell are the Impossible Whoppers better than the regular ones, wtf????        I'm not even kidding, order an Impossible and a regular Whopper, Impossible is better 9 times out of 10, that is literally sufcked up.     When I can order a far superior "vegan" burger for one dollar more and add bacon/cheese what the fuck is the reason for ordering a regular one?    I'm sorry but it's bullshit how good Impossible Whoppers are and it pisses me off.
Do a video on Jack from Jack in the box
FINALLY
You should make a video based on “is it cake”? Objects that normally aren’t cake but turn out to be real cake. I’m high lol
When I saw balls as Schlatt's sideburns I just can't hold my laughter back
this is some family guy humor here
Fuck man if my mom walked in on me watching this she would be so confused
Do a SOLLUMINTIA PARODY 🤣🤣
I don't know if it's just me but the end kind of reminds me of the "Never-Ending Story"
hey mister MeatCanyon, i was wonder if you can make a shy guy reveal but in a dark wired way of madness of some way you can do, please and thank you.  P.S I'm a big fan of your work!
This is just....beautiful.....
What plot Twist kkk
Now he must make an actual Steven universe parody when he has time to do so
Hunter and Steven look like twins in this video
You have ruined my favourite childhood comfort show
2:50 vegeta
THE FACE
"I'M GLAD I HAVE TO DO THIS TO SURVIIIIIIIIIVE" Jeez. First, thanks for drawing Steven. He looks beautiful and meaty. Second, I'll support you. Go forth with making me laugh like you always do.
Ik this is a strange request but I’d love to see some pirates of the Caribbean or Narnia would be dope.
A very open, honest, and raw reality and moment of truth betweet MC's sickening creative mind, and the YT algorithm wanting content now, now, now! Very clever MC. Very clever.
You need to make an adult swim bump IMMEDIATELY
Early 2000s adult swim would have loved you man
I am fucking dead, his sideburns are NUTSACKS
Do a Gumball one!
Why does Steven reminds me of Ron Jeremy bro
WHAT DA HEELLL    WTFFFFFFFFF
I love Dicksney
Here's an idea for you, the dragon thing from never-ending story is a sex offender. He already acts like one anyway, seriously go back and rewatch how he acts especially the first time he meets the kid.
The ending is just golden, truly got me laughing for a solid few seconds.
1:38 🤣
Better than the original show
This is no joke, I got zero notifications for this video and I have bell on and I swear I checked the channel only 4-5 days ago and this video did not show up.

I love how he's his own voice actor for most of his cartoons.
Boom meatcanyon makes a animation of youtube
I think your hilarious but if you need inspiration for cartoons you should look at this lulcow running a channel titled meatcanyon.
That voice, the voice- the voice sounds like someone from adventure time, that frog, in the wizard episode, idk why..
BRING AMBER HEARD TO THIS CHANNEL!!
Do the owl house
plzzz do a uncle grandpa vid
when I saw this I said "oh yea" and as soon as I clicked it, it started with oh yea xD

id rlly love it if you could make a video about Amber Heard and show us how you view the monster she rlly is. Thanks!
Don't worry, at your subscriber count, you'll be able to retire young and finally end your toxic and oddly kinky relationship with The Algorithm 😂
Teddy and I love your channel! Come check out Teddy's channel sometime!❤❤
YouTube animators really get it like this
Can you make a bowling animation?

*Steven Uninverse's big belly
This video made my day

The steven universe background actually looks nice. Not sure if it was a screenshot or if he replicated the look and colors.
I would love to see one about meowbahh😂😂
Here is an idea, pedophilic Batman.
Meat canyon's next video should be arthur morgan being intimate with his horse
I grew up watching Flapjack, so it'll take a lot more to ruin my nostalgia

Oh my FUCKING GOD STEVEN HAS GONE DOWN HILL
Papa meat is the most unwholesome content and yet his humour makes it so oddly wholesome anyway. Gotta love the guy, i have yet to watch anyone do anything that even comes close to what he does. Just the dumbest, most disgusting shit and i find it hilarous.
i love that this video had nothing to do with Steven Universe, i liked this toon quite a bit!
I have to say I love the design for the YouTube algorithm monster.
GOD DAMNITTT
i loved the never ending story reference at the end lol
Yeah Papa, show youtube who´s daddy!
the fuck have we seen
this is hilarious
wouldn't it be funny if instead of tearing down the 4th wall an "adOlt" cartoon built like an extra thick one or something?
All the Kinky things people do to make the YouTube Algorithm happy
the most nightmare full that can ruin my childhood is probably you doing "my little pony"  "yo gabba gabba"  or  "pocoyo"
do daniel tiger
Your BIG OLD BELLY😱
This was a banger video. Always love seeing you animate yourself.
Love this sh!t😂  You should totally think about doing a curious George and the man in the yellow hat animation!
Do Sam Hyde
2:12 just destroyed me. That "Yeah...?" just 😂😂😂
I'm sure the second channel will be..... Perfection...
MeatCanyon is a genius
Dude wtf i just watch steven universe in Cartoon network
Why do I now want a best friend that is a giant metal worm that relies on me and can talk
where's your ring, meat?
I've been dreaming of a Steve Irwin video from Meatcanyon.
Usually you make the characters in your parodies uglier than they really are, but you managed to draw Steven Universe exactly the same!
Aww meat canyon, nobody is going to scream at you for not making content, lord bung deserves it tho, that bitch just gave up
Why y’all did this to Steven my childhood boy ;-;
...
I try, but luckily, I am the youtube algorithm mechanical monster things pet
THIS WAS A ROLLERCOASTER
did Schlatt actually voice this? if not, hats off to the VA who pretty perfectly encapsulated his essence
Your animation quality and humor just keep getting better. Good job meat man.
That's an ad.
are you okay?
Video
i love this man’s character arch
DADDY DID YOU WRONG 🤣😅🤣😅🤣😅😅😅🤣🤣😅😅
If we follower, you second channel... do we need to call you daddy?
Take as much time as you need to get those creative juices ejaculating all over our screens. I will wait for the quality cream
Pick Saihtheclown for the audition
Dude I fuckin laughed good one brotha
I am but a lowly plebeian, but I think you should draw Rikki Tikki Tavi lol
meat daddy is unmatched, uncontested, and possibly uncircumcised
I think and I'm almost sure that the animation clips of steven universe and will smith are animations that he couldn't follow because he didn't know how to continue them and in order not to waste them I use them in this video  I don't know if it's true, it's just something that occurred to me, but if it was, I think it was amazing
if you do ishowspeed i’ll suck a hotdog
Steven Universes BIG BELLY
Whýyyyyyyyy
if it’s that bad then don’t do it, you don’t owe us anything
Its like the rapper but with a diamond in his belly
Came from tik tok and I remembered I don't even have the social skills or time to make my own content 😂 love your videos stay golden 👍
I need a Repzilla cartoon. He's already one of your characters
Dude, that youtube monster thing is covered in spikes, and papa just sits on him?
I now need a MeatCanyon Adventure Time parody where he rides the GewToobAlgodragon! 😂👍😎
I love how this entire video was just one big plug for his second channel. Did it work? yes, yes it did.
Is this how you feel
the Dragon Tails reference at the end killed me lmao
God, I feel uncomfortable just looking and any of your animation. Keep it up. Thanks for being there.
Didn't you say your were quitting or something
best to ever do it
Adventures are fun. It's an Adventure time
Dadaism?
I 3-D print load anime statues If you're interested hit me up
i want whatever he is taking before these animations
Best Ad ever
the Schlatt one was epic
ahhh yes The worm god, Susan, The Will of Thousands lmao
Commenting to help with the algorithm
If you need an idea. Jimmy Savil  If someone can make him creepier it’s you 😊
@MeatCanyon do Harvey Weinstein
The most meta you could ever be
Need some Ideas Meat Canyon, Nightmare before Christmas , Boom !! 💥 Plenty of potential there. Hope You See this Man, "For Your Survival !"
Make a video about pewdiepie
immediately subbed to my favorite internet lunatic's second channel
Meta.. love it
The worst show ever gets a meaty makeover.
This is epic

The stretch marks on the stomach were a bit too personal
When Papa told himself to "be lose with it," I felt that on a spiritual level...

Monster lab s2 ?
Stop it. Get some help.
Could I get that Will Smith cartoon, for huh... research.
I JOIN YOU. WE FLY TOWARDS TUBEHALLA.
I’m just glad you didn’t make Steven universe that uncomfy
fuck. fuck fuck fuck. thats all   jk yo keep this shit up you are the heart of the impermenter   just keeping the fringe alive. im on both channels but dude the disgusting filth that you produce.... gives me hope
Meatcanyon you should make a CoryxKenshin video
Daddy did you  wrong
I just finished steven universe and now I want to kill myself in the past so i die without knowing steven universe and this video
meatcanyon laughing after saying " I'm happy to do this to survive " while riding the youtube machine monster had me cracking up , reminded me of the never ending journey when he was flying on that thing lol
Im actually glad that you spared steven universe, i just really didin't need that trauma
nothing is sacred anymore
The Characters should meet again👍👍
😩HA HA HA  😳 I didn't see you there...
I like how he makes himself so inocennt and gentle "pLeAsE "
yes, feed us Content
Time to send to coryy😍😍
This is why I don’t watch Steven universe anymore.
I can tell that your very tired for making this video
Mad respect for the talent and creativity this man has. Literally turned his frustration into a video and promoted his second channel in a pretty entertaining way too.
can we get an actual SU video tho
Subscribed..
lol WTF did I just watch this had me dying XD
This is the best Youtube animator
I personally havent had my childhood ruined by meatcanyon. I just love the videos; they don't ruin anything for me.
I lowkey enjoy the Chris rock part😂how it show or could of played out, will still phony for that tho
Damn it 😂he’s now done all my favorite CN shows regular show, adventure time and NOW STEEVENNN OH NOOOO
Ehem, it’s actually Steven Universe’s BIG BELLY. Grammar Meaty, grammar.
Out of everything you could have stayed away from this..
Now you gotta do icarly after this 😂
Greatest self promo ever xD
Is that actually the first thing that came to his mind
papaaaa we love you
and then... PapaMeat and Youtube had unprotected secks
Wings of redemption next please
Reaction to this hilarious shiii 😂 https://youtu.be/0AQW1xcibhM
This is literally Muse arg.
Song Name in 2:02
this is hilarious! well for us... probably not for you... but thanks papa meat!
I love how the algorithm is a murder machine but Daddys got you baby.
the personification of youtube is like an enemy from Digimon
Although the will smith and Chris rock thing traumatized me, yay for the second channel!
😂 FFS, but I’ll definitely be on that 2nd channel
💀💀💀 bruh
Well this took a turn
I find the algorithm talk kinda tiring, honestly, even as a joke. What do you expect? To have a thriving channel without uploading videos? You want youtube to spam everyone with your videos that they already watched? (Which they already do, btw. Half my recommended are videos I already watched). It's completely understandable that you get burned out, or that you run out of ideas, but you obviously can't expect to live off youtube when you don't upload videos regularly... At some point you gotta stop blaming muh algorithm. Sorry to sound preachy or mad, not my intention. Oh, and I 100% agree about the demonetization, that stuff is very stupid.
There's something about your enthusiastic Katz voice that gets me every time
I believe Susan has this in her basement
Hey I’m one of your subscribers Yk what I would suggest I would suggest u make one about bar rescue I would love to see how that would be
Nice in all, but here's one tip, you forgot to add in the Steven Universe animation about forgiving literal naz! equivalent dictators just because they all of a sudden want to be "good."
https://www.youtube.com/c/PapaMeat
Do Duck Dynasty next 🧐
Oh no  Not again
the algorithm can suck balls! <3 meatcanyon
I want Steven Universe BIG BELLY feature length and also the music at 2:20 that relights the spirit of adventure and fills me with hope for the future.
NOOOOOOO MY BABIEEEEEEEEE HOW COULD YOU DO STEVEN LIKE THIS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
You should do a video on Speed and Ben.
If Steven merged with Niko
You should try anime ones next.
That Chris rock will smith bit felt Marc m inspired
The amount of discomfort I feel by gazing upon the bulging gem protruding from Steven's stomach is immeasurable and great. The surface tension and pressure underneath his gem making it want to pop out of the socket is the pinnacle of horror and fear I will see on this channel.
You should make a Ryan's mystery Play Date but what he's a super psycho and the mystery play date has been kidnapped or the contestant has been kidnapped
Love the NES ending ❤️ 😀 🐉
The will Smith meme has officially descended into sheer irreversible chaos
This is fucking gold. Only you dude. Only you
Nice video
God I wish I could’ve really reached out and taken his hand..
The YouTube algorithm in a nutshell
I'd like to see a pawn stars parody or something lol
Ngl he kinda looks like you
This man is funny af
is it wierd i have been waiting for this
Click bait trash.
Idea: Dairy queen where a location is being restocked by the dairy queen which can be some grotesque thing that produces the cream used to make ice cream. The other day I drove past a dairy queen after dark and there was a semi backed up to it and I said to my gf "looks like they're restocking" and she said something about the 'dairy queen' and I thought that it would make for a really funny animation. I do see that this is basically like the SpongeBob one where the secret ingredient is himself but still thought it could be neat.
I heard what you said about my wife...  It was- it was just a joke!  I'm about to make your ass as bare as her heaaaaad.!
How did he make this terrifying yet cute
For the record, I would just love to see a video on Dhar Mann
That looks extremely painful to ride,
This went from wtf to kidna wholesome ngl
You should do 6ix9nine
Hey mistah meat canyon can you make one about green eggs and ham?
this was a genious cartoon!
Why
That’s pretty accurate for YouTube! XD
I will always wonder why I enjoy this channel.
𝙈𝙚𝙩𝙖𝘾𝙖𝙣𝙮𝙤𝙣
The tone of his voice "I'm glad I have to do this to SURVIVE" even he finds it depressingly hilarious
I applaud you good Sir 👏🏼
Ngl would have been funny to see how he drew Pearl.
This is incredible! His level of self awareness
The Will Smith bit actually killed me
The way it says "yeh?", without any effects at 2:11 lives rent free in my head
Best one yet
Why haven't you made a Friday night funkin animation yet
Im soo lucky that i subscribe to him i love his videos 🤣🤣
Oh god you animated this thing. Looked great from the original artwork! Perhaps not!  We got kind of more of a higher grade family guy. Of anger at YouTube algorithm!
I love how the last scene was a parody of the never ending story
why do you make cartoons and youtubers cursed
And that my friends, is how you plug your second channel.
0:03 sir, you've gone to far. 🤣
dont act like the viewer care about the video ideas being good
You Sir, are one f**ked up Bunny. Well done. Keep it up.
FINNALLY A VID WHERE A GUY ISNT BEING EATEN ALIVE
I'm crying, joy sweat out the eyes
What about the backyard agains or putin or twd, breaking bad
As if I haven't already been subscribed to your second account lol
Your videos are the worst things in the world right now 😡😡😡😡😡
You sir, Mr. Meatcanyon, are a smooth operator. Way to talk the YT Algorithm down off that murderous/demonetizing ledge!
Can you make one about me
Why.
Why he looks so normal looking?
Steven universe was already creepy for me
Is that zach?
2 million views but it's the fans fault for not sharing cream crew.
I’ve been binge watching Steven Universe and Steven Universe Future and this popped into my recommendation.
“I heard what you said about my wife.” 1:32  Chilling and hilarious.
T H E G E M O F T H E U N I V E R S
this is how I imagine him
make a video about dhar man
Disappointed he didn't think of something more clever for the second channel.. Something quirky, like Meat Spin, maybe. Idk
this was one of my favorite shows to watch in my early teens and you just fucked it up for me.... thx papa meat
Do a sidemen video!!
https://youtu.be/UbvPJQm2ODM  The Real Reason why Cream Crew Split. Hunter has a Pro wrestling career not many now about.
Meat canyon should have a tv show on [adult swim]/CN
ending is cute
You should do an AOT one
No
Why meat canyon why this is the worst thing ever DONT do Steven
You should do the jungle book next.
my eyes 😭😭
How about "Courage the cowardly dog"? Have u done that?
Bro, you need to do a Mr.Incridible video
Steven look like Jordie Jordan & Jay Sherman fusion look alike...
Dayumm Pops,  You either have a serious case of writers block, are on LSD, or are severely depressed.  I'll follow you though. Just promise me you won't put a gun to your head.  Sincerely,  Your Boy,   Surge   ❤
He really just meatcanyoned himself. I asked for this!!! Can we get a Nelk boys   .ill give you all my nectar
Maintenant il ressemble à un vais woke
@"I heard what you said about my wife"👀👀🥵🥵 noo Mr. Smith pls don't spank me🥵🥵😩😂😂😂😂
I’m so hyped for this new channel. After a long sought dream I have obtained the ability to have a good time with the lord of cursed imagery himself  Ps: “Sideburns but they’re actually ballsacks” had me crying
A Meat skit of J Schlatt would go hard tbh
PAPA MEAT 1,000 YEAHS PAPA MEAT FOR 1.000,000 YEARS FOEVER PAPA MEAT!!!
Never ending story
Steven looking veeeeeeery jewish
Riding da complicated and dramatic algorithm so it can stfu 💀💀💀
This might be one of my favorites
Man your fucking crazy 😂
Go on ahead my fellow samurai end send this one in
Felt that stability comment champ
My kid loves this show. But im not ever gonna show him this video it’ll freak him out and he’ll never look at it the same.😆
W h a t
OH NO
HAhahahahaga
Wiw
.-.
Oh pleas dear god meatcanyon i praise for all the days you make a parody of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScvVGrnkbjs i know you do, for all the horror i see pls i beging you.
Do one for the Lorax protector of the trees.

Is the end a never ending story reference?
Hell yeah, subbed ✌️ would still love to see more bastardization of SU if/when more inspo comes
Gawdamn
Why would you ruin Steven Universe. JUST FOR AN AD FOR YOUR SECOND CHANNEL??!?!?

That will Smith one was amazing
Why

C H O N K E
Kinda wanna  know what twitch algorithm looks like now
I feel like someone needs to check in on this man he seems to be becoming unstable
I got a great idea make a video about Ishowspeed
That final reference...   ^_^
Please make season 2 of monster lab
Proceeds to fall back on odd sexual tension
Aye bruv, cool video idea. Do a CARS spin off but when you draw the cartoon, you get to see the inside of the cars. Could be hell gory and nasty, you know, for the content
this is garbage
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
hey listen i have to show up at my govt job once a week to justify a salary so you do too, the other days im generally just pretending to work
You should do Zaboomafoo
This was the BEST ADVERTISEMENT    E V E RRRRRRRR (flies away to Meat's 2nd channel)
I am loyal
Lol
I enjoy how everyone across the world is currently equally miserable with bullshit they put up with every day with the only purpose being to just survive
A discord mod
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
Where's the comma lol
Tom Kenny?!?
Hey do a video on BUILD A BEAR 🐻
2:11 lmfaaooo bro y'all really went crazy with this video 😭😭😭😭
1:33 OMFGGGGGG 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Best advertisement for a second channel ❤️
Me: Mom can we have steven universe? Mom:No,we have steven universe at home!  *Steven Universe at home:*
😂😂😂
make a breaking bad meatcanyon ved
Uncle Grandpa Meatcanyon
I just thought about how good a Majora’s Mask Zelda video would be
Meatcanyon you never did us wrong we love any content you make. We respect you and the time you the too put into these disturbing but lovely videos. We will join you.
How discord mods see Steven universe.
This ruins my childhood.        *I love it.*
MeatCanyon you need help
Not me watching Steven Universe rn 🥲🥲🥲
I think I need the whole will smith toon
I have a amazing idea that I feel like you would love to do it would be fucking sick if you would be open to it
Ewwww
I know you probably wont see this hunter but i have this recurring nightmare were my mouth is full of teeth and no matter how much i spit them out my mouth is still full of broken bloody teeth, the sink fills with my own blood and everyone in the public bathroom is so scared they cant speak and neither can i, it might be a good video! And if not thats cool too
I clicked knowing im going to regret it
I'm dying the will smith thing hit especially when talking about the odd sexual tension.
Can you make something on the depp + heard trial. Think you'd have a field day with it. Especially with the way social media and the internet responds.
Great plug/Click bBait
you never think it would be YOUR childhood that would be ruined until it is
I swear the start makes me on another level of uncomfortable
I´m shiting my pants !!!! LOL This fucking episode was so funny
This man is literally everything I want to be.
Wonder when he's going to destroy them Fraggle Rock rats... ever notice how only a few of them wear any clothing.
This is the smartest way to advertise a second channel I swear. Good job father.
Of course when I just finish rewatching Steven universe I get this video
I'm glad I have to do this to survive then the laugh after got me. Your a king meatcanyon
damn it why I like this 1 it  my favorite show
Damn Steven
The lesson is Meatcanyon is a Genius
You should do a Fallout themed video 📹
MR. YOUTUBE Algorithme machine thing sounds like a skeksis
Can you do a bar rescue John taffer  meme
Always hated steven universe. Subscribed to your second channel lawl.
that YT "yeah?" made me comment, hah
Youtube is fucking putrid. I want Newgrounds to make a roaring comeback and cut YouTubes throat.
Thanks, you just ruined another one of my favorite childhood shows!      R.I.P. My favorite childhood shows. -Steven Universe -Regular Show -Finn and Jake -Despicable Me -Toy story
I think you should make a series of making a animation of what the comments say like three comments made into 3 skit animations in 1 vid (kinda like this vid)
Or you could just get a job
Steven is like youtube...  he likes diamonds
Hey MeatCanyon! Have you thought about a cartoon with Belle Delphine that you can summon  in front of the mirror and she french kiss you with a broken bulb in her mouth?
im dying laughing this shit bruh
Yaaay! Glad I have to do this to *SURVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE!!*
do something with rick and morty
lmao
no.no.nononononononononnonononono thats not steven..
Thank you MeatCanyon Thank you

Never ending story reference?
Markiplier smash or pass
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The youtube algorithm is a bottom??
Man jschlatt but his side burns are nutsacks is something I needed in my life
If smiling friends 2 is a thing, papameat has to be a part of it
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE '
I can't finish this comm...
@MeatCanyon do Think with your Dipstick Jimmy but make it a nightsweat bad dream where the guy runs from the Dipstick man in his greasy mechanic uniform and the dipstick is rusty. down to the dip line. and when the dipstick man finds him he slowly makes his way to him and it fades to black and in the moment of silence he says" think with your dipstick, Jimmy" and it is followed by a scream and he wakes up to his alarm and looks around to see his trashy apartment until he sees the Castrol oil container laying on its side near the bed on the floor and he goes to look into his kitchen and its the irish guy in the corner all crazy and in his underwear that looks up slowly and says "Dipstick? think with your dipstick JIMMY" and starts contorting his body like in the exorcist and Jimmy starts running. he leads him to an old junkyard and catches him in a car press doing some terminator refference. and its all over until the eye glows red.
What the fu-
I thought this was Steven universe 💀
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE \
Why steven
I advised the people who watched Steven Universe...right now is the time to click off to prevent your childhood from being ruined, then realize to keep watching
Can you do something with encanto?
My child hood, you wont have it- Btw heres a suggestion: meowbahh in a nutshell
Take my hand and let's fly!
Steven universe force fusing with everyone and sounds very sus
did... did i just get baited into watching an ad.... wow. nice job meat lol
If you know the “Never Ending Story” inspired ending, you’re amazing
I hope you realize that the voice acting for Steven paired with your facial expression for him combine to be the most genuinely discomforting experience and it as its own video would have been stellar
Love me some Neverending Story references.
Why… you ruined my favorite show…
Appreciated
Thx for ruining Steven universe 4 me
Lol the Neverending story scene killed me XD
I love you meat canyon your truly an inspiration to all of us.
OTP YouTube algorithm robot thing + meatcanyon
Why am I just being recommended this
He has A ligma Ball
This guy is awesome.
Cock and cheese sandwich
Dude I know that praise isn't as good as money but you nail disturbing perfectly I never thought that there could be such a thing as disturbing comedy but you open my eyes friend
The fact that YouTube wants you to upload every day once your a YouTuber
Hey meatcanyon, if you need time off of youtube, or cant think of anything, know you can take your time. If you want to be done for a bit, we understand.
Lmaoo as a fan of Poppa Meat, I couldn't finish the video 📹 but I appreciate the fact he kinda held back on this cartoon. I was 16 when it came out and I still enjoy it like a kid lol I actually just binged it on Hulu earlier this morning to catch up.
hmm
This was amazing! I'm sorry you feel obligated to do this but it only makes you more it a legend then you already are!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Johnny Depp and amber heard trial for next video

Hello YouTube algo, blow this shit up.
A very good way to promote your second channel.

Oh that "Neverending story"))). Tnx for reminding. Cheers from Russia friend)
:|
"TO SURVIIIVVVEEEE!!" Felt 😭
:|
Fr that be YouTude💀
I wanted to see more Steven Universe. Waste of time.
Rebecca Sugar would like this type of stuff, well it makes a lot of sense since she was a r34 artist.
This is very nearly as gross as the actual Steven Universe.
what have i watched..
Alright Youtube I watched it.
DeviantArt artists be like: 0:06
im so glad that the title was sorta clickbait, and that this was just you tryna figure out what to make
Did-did meatcanyon fucked the YouTube algorithm?
This is amazing why do you keep one-upping yourself
You ruined for me and now you’re ruining my favorite show
2:12 ZACH??
Jejejej muito bom
Here comes the rise of PAPA MEEEEAAATTT
Literally Steven universe in 5 seconds “everything is possible with friendship”
Why does he have the nikocado belly
I knew this day would come..
When someone gets eaten by Kirby
Lol
PLEASE DO GARAGE 54 !
1:39 bro
I’m mad at you. Steven universe is my favorite show and  this is offensive to Rebecca sugar.
PREGANTE.
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE |
The monster sounds like Greyroad from 7ds
Steven universe can be a perfect meat canyon video! He has his mom in his belly button, and is half alien
I'm eating...
2:00 AYO HOLD UP
Meatcanyon: I'm a sex addict
ah someone is fighting crippling depression I see....you should probably consider purchasing some crack?
The best video I've ever watched
can you do a meatcanyon version of meatcanyon but it's like a full video
I can relate to this..its so hard to make content lol
The Adventures of Papa Meat and the Monster's of YouTube.
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
Hello papameat. Not sure if you would ever read my comment but I just wanted to tell you that your videos keep me laughing when I have a bad day, I have been fighting t depression for years & I know the feeling of wanting to jump off a building or use a weapon on yourself. Your videos shoot clear messages & I respect you as a human & artist. I just got out of the hospital as well for threatening to harm myself & the first thing I did was look up one of your videos so I can have a good laugh.
Funnily enough, a video about how the algorithm must be satisfied is enough to satisfy the algorithm
Please do a video on joe Biden
Why did that sound exactly like shlatt wth
This is so cool dayum
The Will Smith bit fucking beautiful man
Do something about Elon Musk buying twitter
What if for an april first he just made a absolute all aspiring video
Obligatory engagement comment for the Algorithm. Bless.

Oh god, I LOVE THIS, I love how you obliterate every single child show 😭
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE |
Don't forget about yt and their double standards.
What
I dare you to make an animation that’s not cursed
Wtf
This is the only way id watch steven universe
This is real.
Let's goooooo
Mommy YouTube algorithm is the most terrifying thing
This scares me because Steven universe was a big part of my childhood and I recently re-watched it so the beginning of this video.. Disturbed me per usual. But I love that he announced it in this way.
Bro make me in a video
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE `
Uhmmmm Gus, are you……………..Uhmmm ……………… Depressed?
Time to unsubscribe
Meatcanyon....all my childhood ruined first the regular show second pheneas and Ferb third Steven universe fourth blues clues fifth bob the builder what else will you take away from me meatcanyon Rick and Morty pls that's my only childhood left and of course you ruined the minions aswell 😭😭   Edit:there's a lot more of my childhood ruined
This reeks of south park vibes, were they an inspiration as u were growing up?
Turns out the real villian is YouTube
Damn it, it was only a matter of time before he went after SU next 🤦🏽‍♀️😂
When I get blocked on something I use wheels of different options and permutation, basically play with the combinations of phrases or objects.   Its a associative game basically, see what connections I can make. When something clicks I jot it down, occasionally these jots create a whole story or something together and sometimes ONE combination explodes into somethings. The key is to treat it as much like a game as possible!  This is very dynamic and not at all restrictive to the pieces on the wheel even if they are few. The mind has technically indefinite extensions for any specific "item" as the concrete approachs the abstract and back again...  One can also have a bit of weed and try this. When I do that: I prefer edibles because you can control the dose to figure out what goes best for this exercise, eat them with some fat for better absorption and start the exercise abt 20 to 30 minutes before it usually kicks in for you. Enough time to get situated and your efforts started, maybe even in a particular direction and let the weed effect come in and loosen you up a bit in stages. (Goal is to do something between microdosing and being "high for fun", so adjust mg dose accordingly)        IF there are further issues trying this: When the issue is more mental flexibility, then I meditate using mindfulness. If its concentration, then mantra.  If you couldn't tell from my name, I am a bit out there, but: Someone can adapt these basic principles to a secular mindset if they wish with little problem and have a three part mental hygenic toolkit that will last your lifetime.  Ultimately, "content creators", and workers of all kinds are people too and self-care is incredibly important for lifetime sustainable work and personal development.
you should do a whole thing on will smith and chris rock.     "im about to make your ass as bare as her heeeeeeaaaaad!"
I’d love to see how he corrupts the Crystal Gems
Is that the voice actor for veigar? I loved the algorithms voice haha
Best plug ever
Damn you didn’t wanna just go with the hole weird human centipede fusing thing?  Or were you just sparring them?
Ñ
Lmao thanks meat canyon
Dude you are friggin amazing!!  I am in awe of your abilities to subvert expectations in every video and create masterpiece after masterpiece  🙏🖤Meat Canyon=GOAT🖤🙏
Hey meatcanyon! Idk if you read this but on a lot of your content you seem really good at calling out peoples intentions I just wanna ask can you do a video on one of these mega church preachers who say god can heal you if you donate or like a motivational speaker who makes millions off other peoples suffering? Those guys are literal trash and it would be a shame if you missed out on the opportunity thanks if you read
Lewd anime statues you say?  You had my curiosity but, now....  Oh, now you've got my attention.
this took a wrong turn real quick
vieze promotie
wat een djalla
Now ya gotta do something about depp and heard trial

https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
This was well done.
I feel weird feeling of pain after watching this guy hug this monster of a site.
If I had a gun you probably wont be reeding this right now.
Actually I think love would have been more appropriate than friendship since he constantly refers to it throughout the show but ok
Why do you ruin my memories
A baldi’s basics idea

Does anyone else think…. This is a cry for help ? 🤨
This video is actually hard asf
Loved it! 😂😂
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE `

I love how the algorithm is mechanical
MeatCanyon both scares and inspires me 🤣🤣🤣
The animation reminds me of metalocalypse
Papameat: "take my hand-" Me: (literally tries to take his hand from inside my phone screen) "Papa, take me with you papa."

i just love that he literally couldnt find anything wrong with Steven Universe and just gave up lol. Its just that good.
NOOO NOT MY BOY STEVEN
I forgot to watch this ;-;
Ok why not. That was the best "I have a second channel" promotion I've seen in a long time, let alone animated in full
Daddy did you wrong 🤣
ewww
I don’t think I’ve seen youtube represented like a demon from Hazbin Hotel and flirted with, fun way to represent the artist/youtuber grind
Steven can fit the intire universe in his BIG belly.
that Youtube thing looks like a creature from the Movie 9 (2009)
this s@$t is pure gold
Ok you’re my favorite YouTuber of all time
The tension between the youtube logo and meatcanyon is scary
Please ruin ren & stimpy for me
man, can you imagine what it would be like if meatcanyon was a real guy?
Idk the youtube algorithm monster cool af and also hot af but we aint gonna talk bou dat
And guess what brought me here….. the damn algorithm

Whens the Big Bang Theory one coming?
Stop making videos, please. For your own sake. It's clear that it's damaging you.
Can the steven universe thing be finished? please?
I already subbed to both of them
Papa meats got an Alabama tophat.
You should make a video about Chicfila and how they're stereotyped as overly nice.
God why
😂 wow and I was just wondering why haven’t heard anything about you for a while
Is this a cry for help?
The youtube skit is a sign… but then again Cory always taking breaks so…
oh my god i love this. PLEASE do a steven universe vid i love your take on body horror😭
"The Never-ending Story" music at the end while flying on the YouTube algorithm dragon was a nice touch lol
Makes sense that the YouTube algorithm is a wurmcoil engine
Even though this is literally an ad for his second channel it’s funny asf anyways
Fitting MeatCanyon's video on writer's block uses a show known for multiple long delays
LMAOOOO
His self portrait is beautiful
All joking aside, it is really nice to see more YouTube creators being open about burnout - and what's even better, how kind their fans are to them when they open up about it. Things weren't always like that - but I'm glad it is now.
Potion seller, you’ve got a deal
This is simply the greatest and worst thing I have ever had the pleasuring displeasure of laying my eyes on
The part where Steven fused with his dying mother to save her life completely threw me for a loop, but the awkward make out scene afterwards with his dad entirely made up for it.
I’ll join you bro
Make one in the backrooms
The body of the youtube machine thing looks sharp for him to be climbing on O_O
perfectly timed
theres so much you could have done with steven universe... im disappointed.
Im not gonna let you ruin Steven universe for me
Feed your master the all knowing google machine
My childhood,ruined again. Thanks 👍
NOT MY FAVORIE SHOW NOOOOOOOO
NOT MY FAVORIE SHOW NOOOOOOO
What… ok that’s the world’s wierdest way o announce a second channel but ok
That's a real nice mullet man
what
You remind me of Jhonen Vasquez in the best way.
Please do a Guga Foods animation. The potential is endless.
Papa I do love your sweet succulent videos but when will we receive a my little pony fim cartoon I would get absolute joyful thrills if you’d do that for me papa meaty
NO NOT MY BOI STEVEN
can we please have a full length steven video
bellyplug
Those lines in Steven's belly are pretty disturbing.
My mom was actually the tutor for Stephen unisverse voice actor for a long time
oml.
🤝
Giving me rick and morty vibes in the end there
You took it too far steven universe m. Mm m mmm no no no you toom it too far
It’s a Neverending Story reference… GOD THAT MAKES ME FEEL OLD!!
Is there anyway to pay him for self portraits cause I'd want one lol
I think we and youtube giving him to much pressure.
I don't get the Steven Universe slander, was it really that bad? i never saw a problem with the show, pls explain
I understand your need for stability to not just be done dude. I understand it well.
Your Steven Universe drawing invaded my Dreamscape last night. I had a Dream where adult Steven was Grooming kids (including a kid version of me) and whenever Steven got Arrested for grooming Children online. The courts give him "Get outa Jail free cards" cause he is semi-Downsyndrome. And whenever people try to get Vigilante Justice on him. His squad of Crystal Goons swoop in to save him.
Can you do Mario or sonic
in no way can i understand your writer/creators block, but i think YouTube suppressing peoples artistic capabilities is contributing to the downfall of this platform.
wait the youtube algorithm monster had spikes and dude was sitting on it. whered that spike go meat canyon?
This is the best way someone showed there 2th YouTube channel  11/10
❤️ #TheRighteousWay
Wait what ever happened to steven...
oh my dear lord jesus what is that thing
Jurassic Park
I was saying will smith in my head
i was like noooooooooooo not steeeven
Those stretch marks
XDDDDDD
no one puts this much effort into announcing there second YouTube channel and that's sad
MeatCanyon do James Charles pls
Jewel in the belly button... Barbarian Bros anyone?
Can we all agree that this is the only correct way to draw youtube now
Was the YouTube thing Matt Watson? The “I’ve been hurt before” just reminded me of him.
Do a Johnny Test Meatcanyon Parody
The line “And give me the stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth” followed by Papa Meat riding the algorithm like Falcor; all after talking to it like an impressionable young woman….  Laughed my ass off! 😆
Hey meat, what if you did tiger King and did a Tony the tiger comeback
this was awesome, like your second channel, that people should subscribe to, for more awesome
This inspires me, I have showed this to everybody and they are Inspired! I sometimes rent a plot inna field and we watch this film to give inspiration to our town folk and we show it to them and now they are inspired so thankyou! You beautiful human being 🖤🤟keep inspiring us humble folk from the mountain called monkey! We wait so empty of day just folk, we give our life to you papa meat take us oh Father papa meat! We are not worthy please!!!! Dem us as worthy!!! God meatytyty!!!!! Father ofcourse papapa meat! 🖤🤟
Beautiful pain in agoness God bless you wonderful King! 🖤 #daddypapomeatforlife motherfucker!!! 3000
YouTube algorithm would be a doc ock arm leftover
I like the neverending story reference
I love you man.
At least it didn't ruin my memory of SU.
“I’m about to make your booty as bare as my wife’s headd👾”
Oh no the youtube monster is hot lmao.
I love that fact jshlatt is in the video 🤣🤣🤣
This was too coincidental
This video is the definition of a mood swing
Good burger would maybe be a good animation and like the sauce could be something gross maybe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The YouTube algorithm a lil freaky 😭
Who does that YouTube things voice?
BROO U GOTTA DO CORY
And the descent into madness continues
dude it looked like my grandma
Bro WHT THE F???  I have been suffering from art-rut for like 5 months due to diagnosis of early onset parkinsons. It is HARD to hold your damn pencil/stylus/brush whenever you get tremors. As if that wasn't enough I got a pulmonary embolism a pulmonary embolism in January and then immediately fought 2 months with pneumonia. Im running on steam at this point.   For real tho. how you embaraced it instead of just curl up like I do inspired me greatly. A true artist learns from everything and this was a great teacher. Thank you so much  and I wish you the best.
MeatCanyon skits and sexual tension go hand in hand. Not to say all your skits have it but you use it so well.
Gotta love people with a dark sense of humor
1:35 I'm gonna tell my grandkids that this is what actually happened.
A true artist fears not drawing themselves ugly. It's a challenge.            -Bob Ross
why did this make me hate steven universe even tho its my 2nd faverot freind
I will also join you not-putting-gun-in-mouth! Hooray!
Animaccion de Johnny Depp Por FAVOR
Best laugh ive had all week !
I heard Belle Delphine is trying to make a come back. Do something with that, funny man! Do it!!
I want the official youtube channel to comment “wtf”
WOW!  I'm FLYING!
bre
I wonder if Meatcanyon can do a crossover with Quagmire from family guy and kanker sisters from ed edd n eddy.
Why do I feel like Flashgitz voiced YouTube itself in this video.
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE /
You and your team make animating look easy
The beast, it hungers. The supply of fresh content must not falter.
if u didn't click his gem to get on this video, ur the weird one
Of course the video with him in it is the most normal video.
Ok but I’m still crying over Big Guy’s nut hairs getting in his mouth AND the correction to the Tier list LOL
"ITS TOO SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE" "Fair" Lol this guy is great. Youtube is still a pile of shit though.
Man. I've watched this like 20 times now. This shits gold dude. From start to finish,  immaculate conception. Your voice acting range. The twisted ideas. God damn genius dude. The hysterical, bordering insane laugh turned cry of anguish and rage at the end. Lol
this was good
Another creeppy aninaion.. Nice😎👍
I will join you!!!
Now I can understand, how is hard to you making an animation with new ideas.
I can always say the art and thought/concept of MeatCanyons stories are decent but can we get some more original plots are other shows that aren’t just MS normie shit.  OneyNG, Psychicpebbles, Gonzo, Spazkid we’re pioneers of this shit on places like NEWGROUNDS and yet no respect or shoutout or BTS with MonsterLab if anything to show where the influence comes from.
Satire i love it
Hhhhh your so honest
💕
The weirdest turn I’ve ever seen lol
OH YA DADDY ITS SO BIGG
i feel clickbated but was worth it love it
I like how the title is about Steven Universe. *shows him for 2% of the video
Give me the stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth 😂😂😂
This was fantastic, no other words
PLEASE
these are really good animations but  i love the youtube bot.
This is the best promo for a second channel to ever exist.
This is how a real man does advertising
Yes
My god i have never seen a humble brag and shameless self promotion done so damn well. Goddamn it good sir your second channel has a new live long subscribe. Brb, going to subscribe
Harry partridge vibes
What the fuck 💀💀💀
Here’s an idea shrek
WHY💀
bruh have you considered ransoming nobility for money?  My sources in 15th century France tell me this is lucrative.
NOOOOO
Why you do Steven like that? 😂
"Give me the stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth"
The stretch marks tho 😭
You should make a podcast with the flashgitz guys
I’ve been hurt before 🤣
You could do a Meat Canyon toon about me Just listen to my songs and go from there. Life's gotten a bit better since I started investing in mBTC as a startup until I can get into trading full BTC.  But do as you wish.   *Let's Fly*
I hate Steven universe so this is funny as fuck
You made YouTube look like a cool monster
BRUH IN BRUH BE LIKE'
Please, do not harm yourself. Push ahead until the end (but naturally).
Love the Ending Bit.
Ahhh I thought this was going to be about Steven universe...but it's YouTube algorithm instead 🙏💖
and if we're already subbed to both?? what then, papa meat?? what then??
I cant believe that i watched a whole video that was a hidden add
every time i watch ur videos it always makes me go "wot."
U fucking ruined it bro
Never ending story reference hell yeah
This is like a Rick and Marty outro lol
The YouTube algorithm looks cute-
Next video you should do, should be about the Icelandic yogurt, I mean siggis skyr ?!
Awwwww cmoooon Steven universe is sacred to me 😭
You have to do a Doug demuro animation 🤯
Between you and flashgitz, you guys keep my feed magically weird.
0:08 BRO not the god damn Styrofoam sound effect
hell na
Meatcanyon should be on helluva boss
what.......
WHOLESOME!
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE `
This was such a RIDE
collab with james lee.... DO IT NOW!
jesus christ lmao, can't wait to see the second channel
lmfao one of the best ones yet
First clickbait then shit on schlatt and now announcement...😂 hilarious
So… are we shipping Meat and YT Alg? I honestly see it.
Nobody is safe anymore
Why
Knowing Rebecca Sugar (the creator of SU) she probably loves this lmao
I love you 🙊
I need your sweet nectar Papa Meat
Alright....originally I wasn't gonna give the second channel the time of day because I came here to have my childhood disturbed. But seeing this, along with the pre-existing temptation.....im subscribing to the second channel so YoutubeAlgorithim-chan can be happy
This is fucking genius!
Lmaoooooo
this is the best advertisement ever
WTF!!!
Pure meta content.
………….………….. you need to stop……………. Cease……. I didn’t need to see nutsacks as sideburns
What the FU-
The quality just hit another level
A video about the people in fallout shelter would go crazy
"and give me the stability to not put a gun in my mouth"  woooooooow  Subbed
i love how Jschlatt had testicles instead of cheeks
I was kinda hoping to see meat canyoned crystal gems too but this is cool as well
That house
He lives in the monster lab universe
Wish MeatCanyon would talk to me like that....I too have been hurt before.
david berkowitz? 💀👀
Ha. I didn't even need a whole video to convince me to subscribe to your second channel. I was already subscribed.
"I just can't think of anything Mr YouTube algorithm monster machine thing"
Idk..that jayslat one’s pretty good
Wait htf can he ride YouTube when there is spikes allover YouTube
this feels so wrong yet so funny
I love how so many YouTubers make fun of YouTube and they refuse to change
@youtube
Nah cause is foreshadowing these incels out here
"daddy's here, daddy's got you"
"I'm glad I have to do this to SURVIIIIIVE *laughter*" that slayed me holyshit. I love you so much man, already been subbed to your second channel for a while now and by God this was brilliant.
Is there gonna be more will Smith spanking?
Best Channel Trailer
How the heck did you made Youtube algorithm look both scary as hell and a bit cute when saying "I was hurt before"?
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE \
How is this the most wholesome video ever?
"well that's true, I fall back on that a lot"
Do coryxkinshen (。_。)
Avacado universe
Ok this probably took 10 years to make because WHAT The Fu## this is so good and realistic like WHAT
I love the transition into the second channel promotion
Alright look here I don't like and subscribe to almost anyone mostly because I hate having annoying pop-ups on my phone but you sir are worth those annoying pop-ups
That “yeah…” after daddy did you wrong 😂 😆 🤣
Kind of sad how he feels so pressured to pump out videos,even if his community tells him that it's okay to take a break.
I just love you, simply put.
Love this shit man but understand how they are not banned
This gotta be ya funniest video.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this will proberly not be seen but I'd love to see you do somthing regarding hp lovecraft and his works
i want to take the gem out of this Steven Universe, i don't know why but i feel i want to take it out
That...hmm...well...mmm....ok then.
I can't wait for new adventures of the Gummi Bears!
😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE `
Okay so we're stopping him from putting a gun in his mouth. But what about the flashgitz crew, feels like they are leaving guns around the house.
I still weep for Cream Crew
That’s so weird, I’ve been binging Steven Universe videos and here you are making a video on the series.
Doesn't riding that thing hurt? Ooooh..
4 balls in his jaws
Oh good, he didn’t ruin the other Crystal Gems
Never fail to impress hunter.
Is thats flashgitz voice
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS ?
its funny how how you draw literally everything as a caricature.. even yourself
Which skit got thos demonitized?
Did he just animate himself riding the YouTube algorithm with the *pointy thing* up his but?
youtube does not make money its a sinkhole that google keeps supporting
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
can you do courage the cowardly dog one next been watching for a while
1:33 looking like a double wide surprise
Mr. Youtube Algorithm Monster Machine Thing's voice is kinda hot-
Posible
This gives me a better reason to subscribe to you
And the fact I just got back into Steven universe again. Fuck.
Imagine having a job though
ok meat canyon i like your vids but WHY STEVEN UNIVERSE BRO
The way that YouTube creature is animated makes me scream without the S 🤌
This is the only MeatCanyon upload that made me upset
the fucking stretch marks
The Stretch Marks
The biggest artist in YouTubes history  Change my mind
🤚🤚🤚
Daddy did you wrong baby 😂
I don't know if it just makes me super old, but am I the only person that got the Never-Ending Story Falcor joke? I'm surprised he didn't chase some bullies at the end.
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE .
Pull out the plug from him to release the air.
How bout fairly odd parents. A disgusting Timmy wishing for fucked up things, or an innocent Timmy getting fucked up by disgusting god parents who won’t help because Da Rules.
I love how the YouTube Monster was right and then…
My little pony should be next
plants vs zombies should be next
teen titans referance?
Omg 😭
I would love to see an animation where it's Code name kids next door but instead of just being disobedient kids fighting back against adults, it's like children of the corn and the adults are trying to fight back for their lives like it's a zombie invasion 😊 thank you ! I really appreciate what you do , your the GOAT Meat!
Is this an animation in a animation
Calls himself out on the odd sexual tension, then proceeds to create odd sexual tension 😭
Feel like meatcanyons the type of guy to collude with Shadbase xE
First one to make me actually say "Oh no..."
Jschlatt from another dimension: Jsack
That’s about how jschlaat looks in real life lol
I needed this.
Holy shit
Tix
Make a cartoon on the tip bunny
OH NO no No, NOT MY FAVORITE CARTOON
😳
I am still wondering how are u alive considering all the cocaine u sniff
I've been hurt before 🤣🤣🤣
A want to know if YouTube respond to this video
If possible PLSSSS make a Steven universe episode xD
I LOVE you
Ngl himself in his art style is a pretty cool touch
Thank you
The YT algo monster machine reminds me of James Lee's animations, like "A Life without Facebook" and "Breaking Up with Adobe", ...somehow
@Youtube
We need a Rugrats video
Centichoro cameo
not my fav cartoon😭😭😭😭😭
Subbed to both channels. Now the only other way I can contribute is by donating plasma and a kidney! I might even throw in my pet Ostrich!
oh god
Has a writer's block but instead of despairing, grabs it by the manhandles and drags it to center of attention where it gets stage fright and promotes his second channel. Brilliant.
Plus I really love your videos
When said daddy I was like what the hell
I'm glad he points out how strange Steven universe's nose is. It always bothered me when looking at him.
Modern day family guy
nah this shit bussing, beautifull sheit
*STEVEN NO. WHY AM I HERE*
this was your best video hands down. Made me smile the whole time. Love ya and ur stretch marks too
Wouldn't ridding on those spikes kinda hurt the balls?
The life of a starving artist and YouTuber.
Oh my days, the never ending story reference
this is by far the most technical animation he's done, that youtube monster thing and everything is magnificent
"That's too inappropriate!" I needed to think for a second to compare that with meatcanyon's other videos.
lol so then what's this main channel for then?
ELI5 - Why make a second channel and not just upload stuff…to this one?
Nice
You should do loud house
you did YouTube to piss us off and ruin are childhood you did not do it for the money totally
I'm very imprest with the algorithm voice.
If you need suggestions for future videos, you could do a Sonic The Hedgehog themed video...
Vagina is a great artist
Those last couple seconds were the most terrified i ever been in a meat canyon video
That matt watson?
Mister Youtube Algorithm sounds like Mark Hamill Joker
Barney the dinosaur
Broooo... If you would..... I would say if you could but let's be real everyone knows you can. Would you make a little mermaid cartoon. That would be 😃 great 👍 thanks
Subscribed!
Do guga foods
Do guga foods
You're better than adult swim genius 👏 🙌
No this is my favorite show
Bro when are you getting an adult swim show? Like really though, these are amazing.
1:54 just another thing we love about you 😂
One word. What.
If you want a free idea I gotchu bro: ratatouille controlling the cook but all his hair is falling off and he's super burnt out but the rat keeps pulling his hair to cook
VIDEO IDEA : BELLE DELPHINE AND HER SIMP ARMY
The never ending story music got me.
omfg why did you make this love
DUDE..your animation is top by hand, furthermore, bgn,bgm,shading,vocal team,and humor that's disturbing yet beautiful,
The never ending story reference brought me back
Wtf
I like how he max his charisma state when he's about to die.
very transparent about your feeling lol. still good video.
Wtf did I just watch I’m secretly traumatized but imma still check that 2nd channel out
No.... not steven too  ,___,
The sideburn ballsack tierlist video had me rolling, not gonna lie. I would watch a full video of that.
0:18 He finally broke the 4th wall!🤣
OKAY YOU TOOK IT TOO FAR NOW NOT STEVEN
Thank you for being so understanding towards the algorithm
It's actually Susan herself as a GLaDOS
W
:(
jschlatt is a good one actually
ok i will take your hand bro
dduuuuuuddeeee! KIDS NEXT DOOR! GOTTA DO THEM!
Wasn't expecting that xD
Was the ending a never ending story reference?
Love
No please NO!
…Ong if this guy makes one about my little pony’s I might just flip out
if you ever get to 100M subscribers, I hope they make the youtube algorithm machine monster your award statue lol
Why…why this show 😭😭😭
“I do fall back on that a lot, you’ve got me there “ one of the best parts
towards the end his voice sounds like that of a child.
He makes fun of everyone including himself through his art style, this man is a god
do south park next plzz
A meatcanyon video that isn't disturbing?  Impossible
This. just this.
I adore the design of The Algorithm® being a robotic all consuming worm creature
Best one yet
Eating food and got excited to see a new video is out. Immediately lost my appetite with the nutsack sideburns lmao
Hands down one of the best episodes yet. I am shocked on how well written this is.
i enjoyed this
Is that nikokadoabocado ?
Disappointment 😭
I immediately said "cat falling off dumpster"
Why are you doing this to my soul
Genius!
Papa meat, you done me so wrong so many times now, ruining childhood memory after childhood memory, even ruining shows I wasn't even interested in to begin with, nothing was sacred to you, no one was safe, but I'ma sub to that second channel, cause you captured the evil twisted essence of the Youtube experience better than any other creator out there. For that I give you the slow clap of approval and my single worthless subscription to more madness pouring out of your soul. Keep on keepin on Papa meat.
The never ending story ending lol classic
“Im about to make your ass as bare as her head.”  Holy shit, you run a great channel. Never change.
I CANT BIELIEVE YOU DID THAT TO MY BOY
Steven get the M249
I love it
Make Mickey Mouse Clubhouse gang members
I THOUGHT THE SAME EXACT THING LOLL
*Y o u t u b e*
Unexpectedly wholesome
No cartoon show is safe when it comes to meat canyon/ papa meat
Dude, your own cartoon doesn't look like you. Yo do look more like a nurglete from Papa Nurgle. You have bigger eyes, and your nose is wider and way different
I have nothing to say aside from I love this video.
Was this a cry for help? Maybe youtube does have a gun to your head 🤔
so majestic
The Steven universe fandom deserves it
Bro, you fucking legend lol I love this shit.
Meat daddys done it again 😂 🤣 🔥
Yay he's off break
This show was always wierd as a kid, anyone I knew who watched that show growing up was a total degen too
Wtf did I just watch
I LOOOVE STEVEN UNIVERSE WOOOO
That is true.. i fall back on that alot. Had me dead
2:18 Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww love
Maybe you should do Yo Gabba Gabba
They had us in the first half not gonna lie.
MeatCan x Mr. YouTube Algorithm Monster Machine Thing is my new favorite romantic ship. I look forward to the obligatory and mandatory fan-service filled...."Beach Episode".
god im so uncomfortable
omg yes- addressing the freaking insanity that is youtube's rules and algorithm now. To be honest I am surprised you still are on this platform- because Google doesn't seem to like raw, edgy, dark etc.. content or humour anymore. though that's basically what built this damn platform, that and all the music that was on here and cat videos in the early days.
poggers video very cool
You took it too far man! Not Steven universe too far 😔
i didn't know you'd get to this show LOL
clickbait????
man completely aborted the video idea to bait and switch about his inner-conflict with youtube's shitty algorithm. (probably for the best, i didn't particularly feel like watching steven spit on connie or something with disturbing detail)
God I love this dude.
2:50 bro talk about DragonBalls
Woah 🤣
My mother saw me watching this and took my computer, now I'm in an internet cafe
1:22
the fact that this is season 1 steven
what the fuck
NO WHY U DO HIM LIKE THAT- anyone but steven TwT'
Imagine YouTube watching this rn
I was really hoping the Steven universe video would be finished.
i thought this was a actual steven universe one :(
I love this fucking channel
Dude this was 3 days ago
This was amazing
BEST MEATCANYON VIDEO EVER
Are you off your meds again?
Make a Mickey Mouse Club house a Cult or something
I hate this this is the worst channel on YouTube
Bruh I'm hella down 👋 lmfao 🤣 you awesome bro
Sounds like the thing on Unico and the island of magic.
Steven universe was too easy.  I mean mushing together people's and fusion being sex as the little fat kid has ""not sex"" with his father
Great stuff as always!😎
We’ve reached the end of the animator career cycle, where things get too meta and self aware.
NOOOO NOT SU
PLEASEEE do a Amazing World Of Gumball one PLEEEEEAAASSSEEE
The detail with the neverending story made me chuckle.
Do an invader zim parody
i don't know whether to like this for the skill and creativity or dislike for how horrifying papa meat's content always is
Oh wow, it was all an add
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE :
Don’t you dare do adventure time.
New video very good 👍
those stretchmarks are so realistic lol
I can't believe this is so entertaining for me to watch hahaha 🌚
Not what I expected but I'm glad I experienced it.
INCREDIBLE lmao
I want more than 16 second of that.
BROOOOO MADDDDDD NEVERENDING STORY VIBES AT THE END!!!!!
My childhood is ruined
The algorithm is our best friend and worst enemy.
Ok, but I'm genuinely disappointed I'll never see your rendition of Amethyst.
Could post a 23:23 min video of a ball bouncing and I'd watch it
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
That sucks
When I watched this I was like wtf
cmon..man this is steven.. our hero, our only boy gem in the universe
this is stupidly hilariously retarded and i fuckin love it.
Do an attack on titan one
cursed
How could you say no to his crusade
that's pretty cool
Do something with MoistCritical/ Penguinz0
You should do an ishowspped parody
*facepalms.......... Suscribes*
Y'ALL I'm simping for youtube
What the fack did i watch?
Ninja turtles next?
noooooo not my show 💀💀
This never ending story reference is 🔥🔥🔥 keep it up meatcanyon!
He nailed the steven universe  background, perfectly done👌
what kind of Acid trip in a dream am i having? knew i should'nt have eaten taken free brownies from the homeless guy.
Grest to watch during my lunch
Why did he have to ruin Steven universe for me
If I don't get a season 2 of Mr. Sprinkles....I'm going to he very mad at you.
Why'd you do my man steven like that
This was a really good Steven Universe episode. Little wierd that Cartoon Network approved of it though.
jschlatt tier video yes just yes
Was i the only one that actually wanted a Steven universe video
The YouTube algorithm goes from Starscream to Matt Watson
The never ending story reference did it for me
yeah you get a new sub for that!!!
what the fuck
Me praising meatcanyons depiction of the algorithm was swiftly replaced by the fact that 8 seconds later meat demonstrated that because he drew YouTube.... They were in his world... When he walked up and started sweet talking the thing, that gave me the horrific revelation that once you think you have power over meat. He just draws you once. Then you're in his world...
I still say you make a cartoon about vladimr Putin being a sleepwalking communist, and when hes awake hes a totally nice guy. Love your stuff poppa meat!
Imagine he tryna tel us something with these videos and we just don’t see it yet
I feel so confused and happy at the same time
This has scarred me and confused me I LOVE IT
"Gimme the stability I need to not put a gun to my mouth", I actually fing laughed✨
please,  give me your drug dealer contact
"i have to do this to survive!!!" Hahahahhahahahahaha this dude is awesome. We meatballs support all your weird sht and if this give you some creative freedom, even a little bit, we are down
Can you do will smith  and chris rock hahahaaha 😆😆😆😆😆
I really like how you animate :), it's very cool!, I really love your content :)
I loved this 😂 this is great
I'm glad you didn't go too hard on Steven.
Yes I support your dynamic development! Creativity isn't a linear process and you are right in following your own brainstorms instead of funneling your brainstorms into demands of an algorithm. You're doing great!
HE REALLY DID THE STEVEN UNIVERSE
we love you papa meat !!!!!
The ending reminds me of South Park. I love it. The Steven design was perfect too. Papa Meat channel is really fun since Meat Canyon has to be the most chill and yet funny dude.
This felt like a Rick and Morty episode
This is pure art
Papa meat did us good
Bro animated the fuckin stubble
Discord mod head ass
Steven Universe is safe..  for now....
Atleast your not lord bung who "broke" there tail bone and has only made videos of them on pain meds live streaming for hrs instead of making content for the last 2 yrs
You should make a cartoon of "The Mask"
Oh God, thank you for not ruinning Steven completely.
🤣🤣🤣 oh my god
Yeah buddy!
I got ideas parodies of the following   The Simpsons F is For Family Futurama Bob's Burgers Aqua Teen Hunger Force
I thought it was good but… it’s just a second channel. Lol. Good for you dude. Can you do this but make it not a second channel announcement with a tmg type beat on the End of it? With a laugh and everything lol.
Lol this made my day so freaking funny af 😂😂😂😂😂
Meh. Wasnt really a fan of Steven Universe. But I'd watch the hell out of this.
What have you done papa meat
"I've been hurt before" got me 😂🤣🔨
Wow
The nut sack side burns got me pretty good! Lmao
papa meat is so good at animating that he even breaked at the fourth wall
SURE MY BROTHA ILL SUB SITH NOTIFICATIONS ON
Now that i think about it Meat has  never done a Gumball or Flapjak cartoon, they have so much potencial
How did jschlatt het into this😂
Just when I think he can’t do anything worse he finds a way
perfection
Care bears?
I was expecting the whole video to be just Steven universe but this was a great plot twist that I am very thankful for.
4th wall breaking is just a cliché
😭😭😭 nooo. Not my Steven universe. I itch at the fact that my name is in there to be begin with. Amethyst.
This man turned the algorithm into a gay dragon💀😭
Which child hood is next
Wow  can't believe how hairy schlatt's balls are
This show was weird to me as a kid so I didn’t watch it and this made it worse
WHAT DID BRO DO TO MY BOY STEVEN 💀
Papa Meat!!!! You gotta make me one of your voice actors man 😫.  🎶It’s what I dooo 🎶 *Snaps*  🎶It’s what I dooo 🎶 *Fades away*
Well that escalted quilkly
this guy is a genius
Why second channel instead of using this one? I can't subscribe to anymore, I hit my limit. Sorry MeatCrayon, I cannot fit Papa Meat into my ear holes, so Hope You Keep Uploading Here.
Do Friday night FUNKIN
Plz dude I trust you on it
Can you animate for me about me being a crazy 🤪 ninja killing zombies
The voice changes 🤣😂
Not Steven universe 😔
*Join me on my second channel where I upload wacky cartoons*  Me:nahhhhhh  *Video's of me buying L3wd anime statue's*  Me:hmmm interesting
Does this count as meta
what if youtube comments that will be funny
The gun went from his mouth to my free-time in 0.1 Milliseconds
The second channel plug saved us from having to watch that fat bastard Mr Universe forcefully assimilate with a diverse cast of sexy nuerodivergent rocks becoming more grotesque with each uncomfortable assault analogy.
I don’t know if this is a cry for help or comedy genius, but I think you’re awesome and am always excited to see your work.  I hope you can find your stability, brother.
I just realized if the Youtube Algorithm is spiky all over, is MeatCanyon sitting on-
real
Can't wait for you to do Adrien's "She's just a friend"
👀
What I imagine Nikocado Avocado looks like trying to cosplay as Steven universe
This is great thank you and me
Fudge you MeatCanyon, give me a third channel so i can follow that too. Love you, god bless.
Was looking forward to watching a SU parody but this was better 🥹
This is a lot more smoother
what's the channel name?
How about among us
lmaooooooooooooooooooo
Easy sell for me.
The Falkor music hurt me
Did you just never ending story us, I love you dad
🔥
This started on a rough note, but it turned out to be gold.
This is kinda wholesome
My previous comment is redacted. I watched the whole thing and I’m glad
Wat
I saw this and I got instantly  worried
Charly D'Amileo m Next
Yes Yes Yes
I could watch 5 hours of MeatCanyon just fumbling and stammering as that giant monster threatens him
Pls why
Pls don’t upload weekly upload every 2 weeks
It look like he bouta take off his shirt wit his big belly pokin out his shirt💯
PAPA MEAT!
As soon as I stared watching  Steven univers are you  watching me or something
Bro are you ok tho?
I hope on the second channel will be an animation of what shlatt did in 1999
So I was right tho :))
This is quite possibly the most realistic physical manifestation of the algorithm.
Universe's
wtf, man?
NO NO NO😭😭😭
Can we get art of the youtube algorithm worm alone? Dat shit looks neat
I hope yall are subbed to his second. channel. It would be rude not to after the harda$$ work he is putting in for us.
Should do bear grylls
So is this what the man behind the slaughter looks like
Social justice warrior the Animatrd series
Do paw patrol
RIP Cream Crew Podcast...... you .....you will Walk The Plank!!!
I wanted to take your hand so bad
: /
2:19 reminds me of Rick And Morty.    I also find this funny.
He said TO SURVIVE 🤣🤣💀😭
You should do one about Johnny Depp and ambers lawyer
My god this is perfect
Is the message here is that you feel like people are putting a lot of weight on your shoulders and trying to rush you?
I fucking love this guy
This was incredible. Blink three times if you're not safe
These were all pretty good ideas and it could've saved him months of effort. But he opted to compile them all in one video instead. What a champ lol
I love how meatcanyon can make such a traumatizing video with a message behind it.I just want to take a second and thank meatcanyon for struggling to make us content while managing his own life and still find the time to entertain us
That was awesome. I liked the movement and layering affect of the YT beast.
Loving the algorithm monster
Oh god-😰
What a twist!
Meatcanyon runies my child hood again😭
Thanks meatcanyon ruined the show for me after I finished watching it 😭
0:46 _MeatCanyon feels vibrations from deep below..._  0:48 _The YouTube Algorithm has awoken!_
so unbelievably cursed, i love it
This feels like the “breaking up with adobe” animation
You should do the Grinch
booo I wanted to see weird homunculus versions of pearl and garnet and amythyst
Big enjoy
Yes papa meat. Let us fly.
POV: you huffed gas
Its beautiful
"draw weird shit" funniest shit I ever heard
I died for a couple of minutes after that Will Smith Slap skit.
“i’ve been hurt before” got me dead😂
I thought there was gonna be Meatcanyon lore for a sec 🫤
Thank you for the content daddy
he really put himself into his own animations
I've smoked to much to night.. cause that felt like a fever dream
make a pokémon battle but the pokémon are obviously diseased and shit
This is extremely disturbing
Loved it!!!!
Will Smith spanking Chris Rock gave me some Wabbit Season vibes
Why do i watch this….
Fine...fine...fine... I'll do it.
what about catdog or runmple and stimpee or some anime shit or fallen youtubers
Sonic the hedgehog and tails but theyre handy capable.
Nh
An artist who doesn't just complain about working in a system that has made it easier then ever to succeed as an artist without being a weekend worker for the red light district ? That earns a sub right there XD
0:06 was the funniest for me
Well now we know what keeps you going... A giant YouTube snake that forces you to upload. Least it's a chill snake, I would love for that thing to live in my basement.
👈👉
This came up as a recommendation, no regrets
U have a problem
I love this and the second channel hahahaha
_That's_ the youtube we all know and love.
I'll join
I'm happy that someone brought up Steven Universe, but this is too much.
Jshlatt tier list, but his side burns are nutsacks is a video I could most definitely watch 😂
Daddi did you wrong lmaoooo 😂😂😂😂
A
If I weren't already following the second channel, THIS would be the way to sell me 😂
About time we got to see what happened to Q.
You need better writing.Your animation skills are amazing, but you need someone who is more experirenced in writing to write the scripts funny. The lack of good humor ruins every video when the ideas are so good
This is heart wrenching and I'm less than a minute into this.
you should make one clip about your fans consuming your fkd up art and becoming a slave to it in an online world or sum  :edit to this bs I really just predicted some of what i said before seeing this i amazed myself
Just because of the never ending reference I will never leave
Youtube: you can't make weird s&$t Meatcanyon: well I'm make you into weird s&$t
In the words of psychicpebbles mailman, “Fuck YOUUUUUUU”
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
If you still have writers block, ask your fans for maybe an idea and plot that you could work with. Like Hello Kitty, Clifford, in between the lions, Daffy Duck, yk all that
😂😂😂😂😂
I HAVENT LAUGHED HARD SINCE I WAS A KID LMAO
Hahahaha
JAJAJAJAJAJA
All jokes aside, the animation is phenomenal.
love the never ending story reference
Amazing 👏👏👏
Noooo, this was my favorite show
It’s like he did a meat canyon video on himself and it’s hilarious.
who voiced the youtube monster thing i need to know where do i recognise that voice
Do BFDI. Its objects with limbs , great idea.
Noo not Steven.
"I've been hurt before" 😂
Me: Not my son, Not my son 🙈
Draw the drawer
Was not expecting this.
Lmao good shit bro
God tier as always. Love your shtuff.
Nice
lol will smith spanking chris rock
Oh man dude you have rerouted generations worth of cartoons
NO ANYTHING BUT HIM
" oooh, i've, been, hurt, before."  looool
Broooo. What a twist!
Amber shitting all over the place?
GOAT
Maybe you could make a video based off what the comment with the most likes suggests
Will and Chris 🤣
Well that was a twist
This is amazing
you're my internet friend meat canyon, i would play tf2 with you but can't due to extremely high ping since you probably live in the us
Where did you get the knock-off Happy Flight music?
I am going to support your Patreon so you can keep with the creepy, oddly sexual content. That is your strong suit.
Do a Teen-Titans one plz my friend has cancer and needs this before he passes. It's terminal
Finally an accurate representation of a fat kid
My sister is a Steven universe Stan so im gonna send this 2 her. she’s gonna love it
Meatcanyon and the YouTube algorithm monster machine thing in itself could be a YouTube channel
you literally just recap 2022 with all those short second skits 🤣🤣🤣
Next is uncle grandpa and clarence
Só bora kkkk
The jschlatt reference was amazing
Politically modivated
It was a G.I Jaaaaane joke
Damn bro! He’s about to give birth to a gem colony.
Best video EVVVEEERRR
Title should be: “Man Suduces Youtube Algorithm”
Nice ad for your second channel😂
That... Was so fuckin hot 😮
um i just wanted a steven universe video.
Omg falcor
Awwwwwww Shiet the Steven universe fans are after you now. Better barricade your doors
Aint Steven had 8pack in de end of de series?
HAHAHA jschlatt
meatcanyon is among some of the very few channels I watch regularly to bring me joy and happiness and pleasure my weird sense of humour and nostalgia during these dark times of my adult life. when war is spreading like covid. crime is rampant like Gotham. these channels keep me feeling whole
I now want either a rom com, buddy cop, or soap opera starring MeatCanyon and the Youtube monster thing.
Meat, please dont put a gun in your mouth :(
You should do Curious George, we’re yellow hat has to hide is special little boy cause he’s all grown up know and has a curious craving for humans.
you are cherished as an artist. a creative i both envey and respect. you bring color to a dim world,
What is this shit
The Jshlatt one 😂
It's fortunate for everyone that you're such a genuine and fun person to watch. Come for the art, stay for the man.
Bruh do Phineas and Ferb
Do madigascar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool monster design
Animated himself animating something... this man is THAT chaotic.
Fuck, this is so fucking genius
Bruh i was just thinking about u making a steven universe video like 3 days ago
I thought mr YouTube algorithm monster machine thing would be angry about the content. It really surprises me how you manage to create your content without presenting problems due to the platform's rules.
This is brilliant but it would have been fun to see how Steven Universe's mother actually "gave birth" to him. With enough familiarity with the series a horror parody is really easy to come up with I think.
I love you papa meat
genius
This is the only MeatCanyon video in a year that hasn't popped up on my recommended LOL
Omg
What the hell
I’d love to see a harry potter meatcanyon video
I can't belive he had to even promote his second channel. PapaMeat ian absolute gold mine of content
Papa Meat is just showing off how loving and sweet he is towards his Significant Other.
Uhhhhh
this shit is one of a kind pure gold
This was GENIUS. You’re incredible man
Very Meta. Love it.
This video is fucking genius thank you papa meat
Me: *Waiting for Meat Canyon to ruin Roco's Modern Life*    Also me: *Makes it a suggestion*  ♥♥
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE '
We need meat to do the grim adventures of billy and Mandy, the tone and setting of the show would work flawlessly and fit right into the papa chronicles
Oh man, I hate his belly so much! haha
Thank fuck this was a fake out. We gotchu MC 🙏🏽
idk wtf is happening in this video
I’m waiting for him to ruin another childhood favorite (gravity falls)
Love the neverending story reference at the end
Love it but as a mixed persons I feel you avoid the racism and wokeness to Youtube and it's evil algorithm.
Nooooo! Steven my boy, what have they done to you?! Whyyyy I was just about to watch the movie 😭
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE
I love this so much
Papa Meat was drawn surprisingly normal.
steven is that you?
This gave me the movie 9 vibes with the YouTube bot, I love that
THATS ISNT FUNNY THAT IS ABNORMAL I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE THINK THATS FUNNY? AM I RIGHT?
Me after eating  200 cakes 🎂
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE '
MY EYES!!!! IT...     Has been blessed...
Still waiting on those 90s nick toon parodies :)
3:07 is that your voice😭😂😂 I thought an ad popped up
Great Lessons abound. Relationships take work and dedication. Never give up. Thank you papa meat.
Trust me it’s worth it
this is blasphemy 😭
Dude, I was scared of Will Smith here instead of laughing. The way the shot is angled feels menacing, his voice helps it so much because of how sinister it is. I'd fear for my soul lmao
Funny
This is Meta upon Meta...
NO! xD
Meat pls know that we all love and appreciate your amazing art. It's unique and brings alot ofbus joy, especially talking about the videos we've seen in the past and remembering how they made us feel at that time.   Sappy time over. But srsly thankyou.
Ironically its on trending
Oh no..was will about to hop down the ol bunny trail on Chris Rock?
FOURTH WALL. YOURE BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL.
1:39
This is the best animation you've made
I fucking love this
Bro is hilarious
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 my favorite one yet
This is perhaps the greatest video I’ve ever watched, it’s beautiful.
You know what I’ve noticed is that a lot of great YouTubers refer to YouTube as a monster that sucks the life out of what they used to enjoy. Makes me think back to Pink Guy.
Tf was that ending 😂
I'm surprised you haven't done gravity falls yet.
Yup, subbed to ur channel now. Thats was whole some for some reason
YouTube algorithm depicted as "overly codependent wurmcoil engine" is my favorite thing on the Internet.
Bro the neverending story ending top teir
Bro you gotta do coryxkenshin
*https://youtu.be/KkVu7CvfnNY* ▪️◾◼️⬛🔻🤍🔺⬛◼️◾▪️ *https://youtu.be/KkVu7CvfnNY*
Ur vid is aways nice keep it up.
Dang my childhood is so so dead right now
I have never seen a self chanell promotion be this creative ö
Steven Universe is such a horrible character. MeatCanyon doesn't do him justice in this parody.
God bless. In a non-religious way
long time second channel subscriber 🤝
Fuck, why did I choose to watch this High
honestly, I'd watch "Jschlatt tier list video but his sideburns are nutsacks"
In a dark place right now man but your humor still makes me smile man.
Wtf XD
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE '
Thank god you didn’t destroy my childhood by mutilating Steven universe
Wow
Will Smith didn't *slap* Chris Rock in another universe.
I love this one
Make a video about meowbah
Is it just me or does the youtube algorithm look like Koh the face stealer from ATLOA?
Honestly making a video about his writers block was brilliant, instead of being stopped by it he embraced it. And it’s a very dark kind of hillarious that he made us aware that his second channel is the only reason he hasn’t ended himself 💀💀
So ...we're gonna go a full SU vid right
That was so creative 😂 beautiful
I.... did not expect that.
Obligatory comment to fuel the algorithm for daddy papa meat
😳
the first vid on ur channel thats not disturbing (this is just my opinion)
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE .
“I’ve been hurt before~🥺“  gets me every time🤣
Hands down THE best second channel plug I have EVER seen.. I'm pretty sure I just witnessed perfection
will do papa meat
Yoooooooo Steven has some stretch marks
Are you ok meat?
The j-shlat bit got me good
SECOND CHANNEL https://www.youtube.com/c/PapaMeat
I Love his little chuckle at the end X3
Ive been watching since your first vid bro you are the G.O.A.T.
Shh shh shh, YouTube algorithm.. daddy's got you now.
Why is this so funny
I will join you
wallice and grommit when?
I mean I am into weird shit, so the gun thing could be fun, as long as you don't fire it.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.  (Exodus 20:3-4) - Repent. Jesus, the King of kings, is coming soon.
Wtf??????? 😭
Your amazing!
Great job
The stretch marks
I like how i typed in asmr and this is what i got... Youtube this is not what i asked for but i thank you all the same, can i go to sleep now?
You should do a peter pan video 😙 love your vids!!❤️
Pls do Spiderman
I support. For the algorithm… for the meat
Why.
Yeah, put that gun in there. Yeah...
This guy doesn’t miss
I also like being stable enough not to put a gun in my mouth
Best. Youtuber. Ever
Funnily enough, this got on trending, which just makes the YouTube Monster even more real and hilarious. XD
The chuckle at the end 😂
I laughed a little too hard at that Jschlatt video.
Glad I have to do this too survive 🤣
WTF
a steven universe bit would be funny silly though
Ah yes, your second channel to shitpost on and shirk off production of your main channel. An original idea that totally wont just add to your workload and eventually lead to more burnout. The bright side is that you can always get a stable job if you truly just want to survive. How many more videos of you stepping away are you gonna make before you stop desperately trying to please the algorithm with some half baked videos? There's no passion, there is no fun, and this channel is not your hobby. That's why you distanced yourself with a second channel, is it not? This is a job for you and not even a stable one. Perhaps reconsider your priorities. You seem to enjoy your second channel, don't lose that joy.
Honestly probably one of his most cleverest and funniest video's in awhile🤔
Seems legit
Not the odd sexual tension
3:06 When your YouTube career takes off
Ahahahahahahha
i'm always like wft have i watch everytime he post but i keep watching i might be dumb or something
The YouTube algorithms voice sounds like Meats impression of Zach Hadels impression of Chris chan
We love you papa...
Number 11 on trending lmao
why tf did you reupload a episode of steven universe
When you don't have any idea what to content so he used that as an idea. *GENIUS*
Make a video about hot ones
this is by far the best video anyone has ever made to promote their second channel XD
There's no more investment level content on YouTube anymore. Now with live streaming being so prevalent if people were gonna sit with a single person for more than 10 minutes they'd rather tune into XQC stream
1:59   infamous crossover
this was almost more cringy then usual
Joe Biden trying to get children to run his legs as a child at the pool. Lmfao
Meatcanyon always coming up with the goods!
Pure genius!
Oh no not steven universe
I’m pretty sure everyone will agree with me on this. We need a full video of Will Smith and Chris Rock ASAP!!
This is actually really wholesome
POV: you can’t think of anything
Is this considered "meat canon"?
This was #11 on trending lol that's crazy
Do a breaking bad one
I ship them.
Ugh now I want a full video of Steven Universe nightmare fuel but I’m glad we got this beautiful abomination
Man, I thought we were getting a feature-length Steven Universe one
16 seconds meat canyon, 16 SECONDS!!!
Number 11 on trending, holy shit
*STEVENCADO AVOCADO*
Make a sequel to I can count to three please
1:37 if he said “woah dude, it was a G.I. Jane joke” I would have died physically”
I still hope that someday, youtube will have an algorithm that works for animators. Pumping something out often must be a nightmare. -Inb4 “meanwhile in the anime industry”-
I like this.
We found GlaDos sister.
I wanna see courage the cowardly dog  👀
What a guy
This trending is fucking amazing.
This sucked lol
respectfully, I want to remove my eyeballs and blend them into a smoothie. oh- my ears too. Amazing as always, MeatCanyon!
This is just epic
Some child: “I have a wonderful childhood with wonderful shows, books, and games!”  Papa Meat: “And I took that personally.”
"Give me the stability needed to not put a gun in my mouth" felt that
that's the best shameless plug i have ever seen!
I’m subscribing to both channels 🫘🫘
1:38 THAT SCENE HAS ME IN TEARS, I CANT I DYING
We always support ur content MeatCanyon!
The only wholesome meat canyon vid
😭
I like how once you've gotten so horrific that the regular old vulgar molestation and warcrimes just wont do it anymore, then the only place left to go is the true existential horror of reality. :)
The thumbnail has MC as in marvel comics right?
WHYYYY
Ngl I want more of this...
hmm i wonder what meatcanyon is trying to tell us with this video
wth is this
Elon Musk should've bought YouTube instead of Twitter.
It's so sad with YT animators. Their downfall really isn't them, it's YT's algorithm and mainstream bs that makes them irrelevant over time. Glad to see Zach's cartoons on Adult Swim, kinda wish OneyNG took the deal way back then. Gamegrumps is dead now but Erin had such a good thing going on that he'll never do again. RicePirate is gone, FlashGitz has more misses than hits, etc
I dont know if the gem is his belly button or he just stuck a gem in his belly button. Either way, I am deeply grossed out, thanks Papa Meat!
ok but i would rlly like to see a full steven universe episode of meat canyon cuz its my favorite show
Love ya papa
I’d actually love to see Papa Meat’s interpretation of the Crystal Gems and Rose Quartz. I’m a huge fan of Papa Meat’s take on the body horror/eldritch horror genre (and also Steven Universe lolol.) It’s really incredible to see how popular he’s gotten. Thank you for the good food father. 🙌
This is too funny. I would love to make videos like this someday. Oh, the talent this man has.
I love little Steven is in the video because there’s so little good to be found from that show that it’s honestly hilarious.
Bless this man I hope nothing ever bad happens to him
Your whole channel is a mood, but especially this video. Thank you for being you. <3
Omfg lmfao
The jschlat got me 🤣
Was not expecting this😂😂
😂
That was gold my guy
damn what even
Can you please do one of the fairly odd parents? 😅
Awsome
Only lying thumbnail I respect
This was Awesome 😂 love you meatcanyon
#11 on trending, congrats
Since when was Steven Nick avocado
I LIKE ICE CREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Only Meat can soothe the savage algorithm...
Hi
Follow my page I catch and expose online predators! Like and subscribe for more catches !
cuties
Algorithm is awesome 👌🏼
TRENDING DADDY
Best channel ever
Just perfect !
You should make a parody of The Amazing World of Gumball! It would probably be hilarious.
Tmnt?
I hope that he wont do Gravity Falls *wink*
WILL SMITH BURNED HIS OWN WIFE
Love your work as always! Do you think you'll ever do one on Steve1989mreinfo (MRE review guy)?
I thought you were talking a break?
We need thanos to rip out steven's gem
All hail papa meat
wtf is this cancer....
what the heck
I feel atacked, 'cause my belly looks like that lol :/
OH NO DON’T DO MY BOY STEVEN LIKE THAT
How can I make a video suggestion to papa meat? It's awesome.
Nice never ending story
Are your animations hand drawn, puppet rigged, limited, or hybrid?
3:07 never ending story reference?
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE `
MeatCanyon is the FUTURE!
it's ok, if the youtube algorithm won't forgive you, idk, but I will if you take a break
Accept Jesus as Lord today and repent of your sins
Meat canyon needs merch
Why does he look like micheal Jackson a lil bit
Unbelievable 😂 love it
For the algorithm
I respect this so much. Letting us the viewer know how the pressure feels to pop out so many videos in a certain time frame. Yet not break down and make a second channel which he can do a multitude of things that both gives us views (and the YTA) things we love, but also for meatcayon to do what he enjoys as well. A win win for everyone. <3 Can't wait to have my childhood ruined once more XD
papa meat bringing the sauce
Omfg this is the type of ish I love keep it coming please.
You can do tension impact
You should make a video about what happens when your hot chocolate gets cold on the polor express. I bet you could make it really scary
the end lmaoo
bare as her head
Love the dynamic between him and youtube
Just an idea you should make a turning red one
The will smith part killed me 😂
how tf did you ruin my favorite childhood show in 10 seconds
what is this crazy channel. sub.
1 minute in….😦I love the truth brought to life in this!!!
I love drawing but I don’t see how you can manage to make them as often and with such quality.
I was just thinking that the "Childhood character turned pedo" was getting too much repetition. My expectations were subverted
11 on trending lmao he was right about the algorithm.
Brilliant.
lol thats pretty meta
That sounds unnecessary, why not just do it here?
Somewhat wholesome
The Never Ending Story vibes at the end
yo fuck this ad for this youtube video
#11 on trending
hahahahaha oh you wonderful bastard! you bring so much joy to my bleak existence
do a spongebob video
The Papa Meat channel brings me a LOTTA joy. It's like the perfect blend of weird MC shit and down-to-earth human shenaniganery and it is RIGHT up my alley. Reminds me a little bit of Cinemassacre, which is like the highest compliment I could ever EVER give
Well alright then.
season 2 of monster lab ?
He even gave him stretch marks.😂😂
Wow, definitely your most terrifying video.
U can make a vid about the avengers
I think this video makes you my favorite youtube creator now, holy hell
best 2nd channel plug ever. to the point its trending number 10 on youtube.
Why does my childhood nostalgia look like a 32 yr old man?
I loved the jschlatt part😂
YOU ARE A GENIUS
Lmao this video is now 11 on trending after that worm
This is meta as fuck.
Man that belly button is giving me anxiety
Dude you should really make your own parody show like Robot Chicken on Adult swim your animations are a masterpiece
That scruffy beard must have been hell to  animate
damn MeatCanyon here using Steven universe to trick people into watching this video about his problems with YouTube. Respect
IMPROVEMENT! no really it was.
I thank you for your perseverance, you could be just doig porn and making millions but no. Salute :)
#The #last #book from God Almighty, which was revealed to the last Messenger before the Day of Judgment and which came 500 years after our master Jesus, peace be upon him, says: And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, "O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah ?'" He will say, "Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.(116) I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness.(117)  https://youtu.be/XOD2KXXzsjM
Feed me daddy for i you're viewer am hungry for more ... daddy plz, i am starving feed me more content PLZ !!!...
WE AAAALLLL LOVE YOU METCANYON…WE LOOOOVE YOUUUU
Why is the monster hot
bro why
Que bizarro
Bro the genuine laugh at the end d’awh 🥹 I love this man! ❤️ I will always support you papa Meaty.
I rlly wanted to see him destroy Steven Universe but this ad is good regardless
Those stretch marks though... perfect!
Let’s all notice how the name of the video had nothing to do with it at allll🤣
Relatable
Id take your hand and fly. xD
Ur fucking sick....... I love it 😈😈😈😈
This was the greatest meatcanyon video yet 😩
The Will Smith part gets me every time I watch this. 😂
We flew :)
i love how this is trending top 10
Hey Meatcanyon I have an idea to save you from the YouTube death robot, maybe you could make a TMNT animation?
You should make a fill swift one
THIS IS EVEN BETTER GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S ON TRENDINGGGGG
But I'd like to know more about that big belly
Truth
Meat Canyon gives me so many Rick and Morty vibes
This is literally the best. Love ya Poppa Meat
Never Ending Story at the end was perfect
The laughter at the end of the video :3
This being on trending is awesome
How is he riding the YouTube algorithm without ripping his balls to shreads
Could we get a chowder video one day? I think your style would be very funny
Ah yes lets all sub because we're subs like bionic youtube centipede and meatcanyon is daddy
I WANT TO FLY!!!!!!
ironic that this is trending on youtube
I have the same hairstyle than meatcanyon
Big BeLLy 👁👄
Bruh weird plug but ok
Well that's a new creature movement
I knew this type of video was coming, and I love it. If I had to suggest a wacky idea if you're having writers block, it'd be charletts web but with Wilbert being a maniacal tyrant at the end after learning about mortality, like it's mixed with animal farm. But just churning out parodies over and over shouldn't be expected, comedy is hard
I like the animation shorts style of this vid and others on “Papa Meat”
this tells the story pretty well tbh. Well ill at least click once in a while and watch the ads my man. No doubts youll be pooping some quality jankem that ill get high off of though. good luck
Hotdiggedydemon did something similar to this:   A clickbait he titled something like "How Star Wars talks about Abortion" or something utterly outlandish, but the bulk of the video was dedicated to his sardonic cartoon ghost friend talking about a fictional cereal brand and milking the heck out of that product plug just to troll viewers. And in truth, Max Gilardi didn't have much to speak of on the subject of Star Wars and Abortion anyway.   In any case, this was a funny video too.
Jschlaat but his sideburns are nuttsucks 😂😂😂😂
I fucking love this. God Bless Papa Meat
he is riding his own butt scratcher, best evarrrr!!!11!!1
The YouTube algorithm monster machine thing was a cool design
I cried when I saw the notification
...wtf happened to Danny McBride?
did he just pull a family guy?
Amazing, as always.  MeatCanyon is life.
What if you do one of Randy Cunningham 9th grade ninja
Can we get a lovely Sailor Moon vidya?!
what the fuck is happening, and where am I
Papa meat is a fucking genius. Period.
Love you bro
Don't let the internet wave on consumerism like YouTube, consume the purity of your soul, meat.
Any one of your videos would/should sate the masses for longer than you think.. even if you let 5 months pass between each video it would still be enough.  It is amazingly creative and unique content that we are getting for free.  I know you’re joking in this video about the pressure but I’m sure you do really feel it. Please try not to. Anyone putting pressure on you does not deserve to witness your contributions to this world. Traumatizing and beautiful as they may be.
*This a nice episode of Steven shitverse the only thing that separes this from the 'real' deal is that it has no LGBHIV+ propaganda*
Can i say a show . Which is the one WITH THE DARKEST AND BIZARRE SHIT he could make ?   K.N.D    BOOM!  and now our childhood is fuck  For real
We're HERE AGAIN
We love your meat canyon. Your videos are something you work hard for. No matter how much you change we will still love you are disturbingly cursed content
lol
Respect for him showing how the algorithm try’s to force things on him even though he does great
Lmao 🤣 this is my favorite one
This shit was weird, man.
god he looks like a discord mod
Oh no
I Clicked this Expecting a Creepy Steven Universe Parody, But We have a Meatcanyon Video, He Animated Himself in His Video! {I like that, Its Cool when He puts  Himself into His Videos!}
I'm so relieved it wasn't actually about SU. I don't want my favorite show MeatCanyonified
Another childhood memory demolished, impeccable work meat
I hope he's not planning on being primarily a YouTube streamer. I like him for his cartoons.
Yeah that pretty much sums up the algorithm
Bro got the worm decepticon from transformers in his room
Can  you make an animation about  The boy and the Giants Apple? Or was it a peach been a while since I saw the moviw
U had me at 'stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth'
That👏was👏 An👏 amazing👏 Video👏 😍😍😍😍
Hnnnng Stephen undi-verse
Well I came here from Newgrounds for this.
*Sees Steven Universe*. Ohhh this is gonna be goooood.
1:30 I’m fuckin done loooooool
Wouldn’t be surprised If Rebeca Sugar tries to take it down or something stupid I dunno
Can I get some subscribers? I post cool/funny exploring videos :)
Help
You never fail to digust me, I love it!
PLEASE DO TELETUBBYS.
Hey, Daddy did you wrong. Yea? Yea. That's why I got a solution baby. Look at me. Come here. Look at me. Daddy is here. Daddy's got you
Power rangers but they all want to have an 0rgy
The fact that this got on trending is the best thing ever
W
who voices mr. youtube algorithm monster machine thing?
This dude is fucking crazy. I love it.
I just realized I’d be cool to see an Phineas and Ferb animation
I'm actually done finally I'm now scared lol
how many times in the middle of animating do you just go like what the hell am i doing for a living
Papa
Nooooo que es eso
Gorg
So he's just going to do slightly more shit than he did on this one secondary YouTube channel that's slippery slope have the feeling of this channels going to be dead in the water soon.
2:54 relatable moment
The Clog.
I like how the top comments did not seem to actually watch the video.
AMAZING!!!!!
I felt that ending hard. 😂
Sir meatcanyon, it it but my humble request to ask you to make an animation about the mancubus from doom eternal
I knew Steven is fat
I swear I can never get enough of these abomination videos🤣
I would love a video of you telling us your fav animations or indie animators you like!
No not Steven Universe.🥺🤦🏽
why
He should really do a video on httyd
hello
This video is stronger than you
2:00 🤣 bro you got me in tears with the whole seduction thing! Also, great job on using writers block as a tool for writing that’s pro level shit.
discord moderator Steven universe
NOOOO
Epic Video!
I love that you animated yourself. Meta as shit.
You got youtube so right.
MeatCanyon you should’ve given YOURSELF a Steven Universe Gem
I like your hair, MeatCanyon
It's. It's beautiful.
You are what the internet needs, I have missed silly fucked up content like this. It's what made the Internet lol
Im proud to be a subscriber of both channels
i was tricked
I love how it breaks the fourth wall showing him doing the animation and then breaking a wall my chinp brain can't even fathom by then talking to us
Meatcanyon always outta pocket😂
the never ending story reference is so good lmao
Metacanyon
Upcoming youtube "....Im going to upload weekly..." upcoming youtuber then dies from unmanageable expectations
i love meatcanyons content
im leaving this fucking fandom
need codename kids next door
Is that OneyNG as YouTube?
Flap Jack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
MY  CHILDHOOD HAS BEN RUIN
Bro this was an ad for his second channel 😭😭✨✨ amazing content despite, you're one heck of a man Meatcanyon
Oh c'mon why just why every thing else is fine but no don't do my man Steven like this oh I can't do anything about
The fuck is this bullshit
"that is too inappropriate!"  .......is it really *that* inappropriate considering the other stuff he has made?
That never ending story bit took me way back, I laughed, then I remembered the swamp of sadness, Atreyu and Artax,  then I cried at that long repressed memory.
Bro don't feel pressure to upload take time with it art takes time you know
HAHAHAHHAHAH
plot twist I was already at the seco nd channel
BROO!! I FUCKING LOVE YOU IN A NOT HOMP WAY!! YOUR ARTWORK AND ANIMATIONS FUCKING ROCK HARDER THAN HEAVY METAL, LETSGOOOOO
I used to love this show and now its ruined.
Love having a second channel but the way he announced it is rather strange
wtf
One of the best so far!🤘🤘🤘
3
i actualy really like steaven universe but this ruined it
Of all the shit you could parody, I never expected you'd 1. Parody your own life, and 2. Parody Never Ending Story
🎆 d a d d y 🎆
I'm so happy you exist man. You genuinely make my day, most days.
Lmao
I fucking, love this man💯
I love the YouTube algorithm monster thing
Papa meat you can throw anything you want at me and I will watch it
The final line of this video is truly fantastic
Really liked that never ending story reference at the end!
You got me at "Give me the stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth!"
Jesus christ was a horrifying perfection
Already been subbed :)
🤣🤣🤣 What the heck!! Love it
This is Masterpiece.
I wish you had your own channel with unlimited freedom to create your art
OREOS ARE S TIER YAYYYYY :D
YES THE VIDEO I HAVE WAITED YEARS FOR.
MAKE A BAKI ONE WITH HIS DAD THAT WOULD BE PERFECT
NIKADO AVACADO STEVEN
❤️👍
Very meta. I like.
THE WILL SMITH ONE HAHAHA
Fuck up Teen Titans
Stay safe Meat Canyon!
Now this is content bruh, always unique 🤍
o
Nikocado Avocado🥵
Love it
This Steven is way better written than the actual one...
When your writers block becomes an idea instead of a block
Total drama island
When u got the same strechmarks as steven universe
I came looking for copper but I found gold!
please continue wherever the steven universe portion was going 😂😂
Should do a creepy doctor who one
🤣🤣🤣
"I'M GLAD I HAVE TO DO THIS...TO SURVIVEEEE!!" lmaoooo
The Will Smith one is pretty good.
I love this!
I am so glad that this was a bait-and-switch. 'cause I did NOT want to sit through an MC SU video. Huuugh. It would've been so extra-cringe that I would've folded myself into an origami crane, turned inside out, and cringed myself out of existence.
Not steaven every time you find new shows out you cures them

Meatcanyon, the 👑 of all 🐐s
@MeatCanyon Your Sponngebob got confirmed for Monday Crismon Morning, How Do You Feel
I've been watching you since newgrounds, you've came so far Meat.
Wtaf
HE'S PARTING THE MEATCANYON FOR US TO PASS THROUGH!!! (Do a red sea vid let me know if you need a jesus know a little Spanish.)
Man, whenever a new video drops its like getting a double-wide surprise. Got Daayum!
For real man, when I get to the breaking point of life (to put it nicely), these videos are therapeutic. Reminds me of the only person who loved me which is my dad and watching the classics like Ren and Stimpy etc... Ty bro. Much love ❤
this whole video was a switcheroo bamboozle. ouch
This is brilliant.
they just keep getting weaker & weaker :/
I thought this was about Steven Universe 😭
Those stretch marks
"daddy did you wrong..." "Yeah? 😖"
NAW BRO LET ME SEND IT TO CORY 😀👍🏽
nice
Peepee Is Stored In The Cheeks
He should be in adult swim
This… this pleases me… in so many ways. I was waiting for the “never ending story” knock-off music to kick in at the end.
I never get these references, I'm way out of the youtube loop.
Lets flyyyyyyy
Omg he did a never ending story ending 😂
This is gold. Pure gold!!!!!
This video gave me a reason to start working out instead of looking like Steven Universe
As a Youtube content creator this is the most relatable thing on the Youtubes... right in the feels man
love the neck beard 🤠
Love the JSchlatt feature
Was this a cry for help?
What the fuck
Don't worry Meat. Ever since you made your Ed Edd n Eddy twisted dark episode you've had my loyalty from the start.
That real laugh at the end.  😂😂😂
why never ending story, now I wanna see a whole vid on that 😫
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sIYe74sczE
look how they massacred my boy
Spooky scary sunday finna be lit🔥🔥🔥... Corey where you at... Samurai squad
SO NO ONES TALKING ABIUT THE BIG ASS NEVER ENDING STORY REFERENCE AT THE END?!?! YOU HAVE MT RESPECT MEAT
Bro out of all your videos this was not it😭
You'd be an amazing Peter Griffin i swear...
If they take this down, it’s canon.
The way seduced YouTube algorithm, very smooth
Hey man, I know this was meant to be funny, and boy was it, but I really do hope you're doing okay and that you're finding ways to work through that burn out healthily. Much love, and keep up the amazing work.
But wait! Does that mean he is going to tone down his amazing creepy cartoons?
Ruining reality as usual.... Gold🔥🔥
It was the laugh at thr end for me
The second channel is just as amazing as his cartoons. if you haven’t, go check it out
Hilarious concept and promo video.
lol lets fly away!
Papa Meat, I just gotta say, you are genuinely the only person I look up to on this Earth. Love you, man.
"..the way you did his voice, and the pacing, made it feel like odd sexual tension." "Well that's true. I fall back on that a lot. You got me there."  Proceeds to do the same thing immediately afterwards while he caresses the face of the YT centipede
You should totally do a KND video next
Papa meat animated is the best thing i ever saw
I hate it when someone says that these parodies ruined their childhood.  I'm more impressed how he can turn children cartoons sinister but never losing their plots
Please do  Family Guy
👁👄👁
Youtube monster algorithm machine thing
when the youtobe want see this video:😍
Aww
Hahahaha God I love you papa meat
i love you man!
This made me sad
Don't let YouTube get to you, Hunter. You're doing consistently great work on both channels.
Do one on Ethan Klein from H3 not being able to escape the cancel monster no matter what he does to try to please it. Then you walk in with your absolute inability to be canceled show him how to defeat it.
Pearl: steven... steven what did you eat? Steven: I ate a human...
This was a shit show anyway
Man his delivery talking about the channel gave me serious vibes of the "Lesson Learned" speeches in South Park sometimes.
lol
Papa Meat - I love U so much :) MAKE MORE CARTOONS BITCH! I have a ton of ideas if You're interested... :D
I'm a bit surprised he didn't ad Artax in with that reference. Phew.
xd
Sobbing my childhood show
Omfg 1:30...
Fkin top tier dude. Shit had me rolling
No matter what you say your stuff will always be the best thing on YT
This is literally the funniest meatcanyon video ever.
Mr YouTube algorithm monster Maschine thing kinda cute tho ngl…
I cant help but imagine Meatcanyon making the disney Hercules on steroids
Lol. YouTube is perfect like that lmao.
:o
where is the kids next door video that shows how all decommissioned operatives actually get turned into treehouses
Amazing
Lol, even though Steven Universe’s color matches Meatcanyon’s icon.
Meatcanyon is quite literally the only person left on earth that can make a mullet look good.
https://youtube.com/tsn 🇺🇦
I like how the algorithms voice sounded oddly familiar to his voice for CEO Susan 😂
LOL
I love it
Never a miss
This is gold 🫶🏽
Make a gravity falls video
That sounded way to much like schlatt
I now ship youtube and meatcanyon.
This is the most rollercoaster emotion inducing monster of a creation yet (maybe. Blue's clues was still pretty sickening.)
unironically one of my favorite videos. nice twist
Love how he flew away on the YT algorithm like he was Sebastian flying on Falcor.
Fuck... that was pretty funny
Surprised there hasn’t been a KND animation yet, I feel like with amount of characters In it could make for some very interesting designs
Yo, that's Berkowitz
Hey, your job beats a lot of things. As long as it's still what you love.
I already have, ol' buddy
Why does Hunter turn into a mexican when he animates himself??
that was some of the best self promotion I've ever seen
I LOVE YOU MEATCANYON
stopppp
should do a video on CHOWDER lol
Love u dude!!!
Me who is already subscribed to that channel: "You did good, Darek....you did good."
Steven uinverse was my childhood see this kinda traumatizing but hey white diamond taking out his gem now might kill him lol
That Will Smith thing was friggin GREAT!!
We've reached unprecedented levels of meta.  I shudder to think of what happens next in the meat canyon cinematic universe, aka THE MEATVERSE.
Bizarro como semprekkkk
I'm sold 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao!
New series where meat canyon is neo and YouTube is like the matrix???
Holly, this 3 n' half minutes of Meat is like watchin a film. only, film has non so good story build up than this guy's 3 mins. Keep it up, Meat. You are G O A T animator!
This is objectively less disgusting than the actual show.
https://youtu.be/wszzcUeKnp8
I'd love to see the rest of that Will Smith slap clip
I hate how accurate this is
pls stop ruining my childhood 😩
The comment Will said to chris before he smacks his ass 🤣
So meta-l.
Lol
oh wow
The fucking Jshlatt part 😂
I would love to see your take on the hunchback of notre dame. I’d be funny if Quasimodo was beautiful and everyone else is ugly.
Bro. I know you got 5.7k comments here but I really hope you find mine.   Your work is fantastic and it saddens me to think that you've been feeling this way man. I know what it's like to create so much and get burnt out.
Lol the stretch marks!!!
Fuckin great. Thanks for the laughs.
"Daddy did you wrong baby"
Not Steven lol  Fly meat cannon! Fly!
The stretch marks are killing me 😭 good worn meat
Okay, seriously, was that a low-key reference to Flight of the Navigator, and The Never Ending Story?
Jschlatt looked haunting
If you're really uncomfortable with a fetish you have, and you're looking to try and turn yourself off from it, then Meatcanyon is the channel to go to.
I love how meatcanyon has been able to curse himself
erm
This video ruined my life
This might be one of my faves
A day and a mil views already        Christ......
@MeatCanyon Sir why did you make yourself look so ugly in this cartoon?! You are far more beautiful than this mockery of flesh scribbles you have connived is a creation of *LIES!!!* (Also I would love to see a cartoon or even a short of something involving the Joker! I'm pretty sure I've watched all your content and never seen anything involving the Joker.. You did my other favorite character Jack Skellington! *LOVED* that one lol.. Have a blessed day you scrumptious baby boy.)
The burnout is real, we love you Papa Meat! Take good care of yourself
The algorithm is monster that causes many people to become depressed. As a Veteran, I have to say you would be smart to start moving to rumble to be able to put out more risky content against Democrats.
Okay but holy shit how did I know it was going to be something about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock as soon as YouTube said “something trendy”
The Neverending story reference 😂
damn youtube algorithm is sexy
Real fans know this is his cryptic message crying out for help. The comedy we enjoy takes nightmares to make lol
This is how you get YouTubers to follow a second channel, fuck yeah.
*I think this guy needs help*
“uhh, i’ve been hurt before” lmfao
So what's the difference between the animations put on this channel and the ones put on the second channel?
Best clickbait ever
Hey man can you make a nba parody? I would bring back my mother from the dead and sacrifice her for you to make the video. 😔
Hahahahahahahahaha
Based
But I need that will smith and Chris rock video for u know research…
“thats too inappropriate” 💀💀
This is a visual representation of what it's like to achieve Nirvana
The most high quality self advertisement I've ever seen. On another note, I wouldn't mind more short compilations of a bunch of stupid ideas like this one, just blast through making fun of pop culture and influencers in like 10 second clips rather than writing a full story and whatnot.
Youtuber's Anxiety: What to do when the niche you're making meta-textual content from and the drive to do so runs dry.
Fuck the Youtube algorithm. Why do content creators limit themselves to set schedules of when they need to upload. Literally no other medium of creators do that to my knowledge; like poets, novelist, painters, composers, etc. Just work at your own pace and upload, and then the sheer amount of popularity you already garnered will propel you back into the algorithm
Oh.....
1 million
Don't worry Meat, I never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
Nikocado?!
Yaaaaay creator burnout.
This is fucking amazing
MeatCanyon has got to be the best channel i have ever subscribed to! Haha my very first video that had caught my attention was the Secret Formula vid haha amazing work
(Meat Daddy's Voice)-My God
“And give me the stability to not put a gun in my mouth.” Lol I feel that
You can't tease me like that Steven😰🥵come back
I love this
I loved this so much, love you papa meat.
This was a was  a trip, i didnt know this would turn into an ad lol
funny as hell 😂
My childhood…  Edit: actually, it’s better now
I. Love. You. Capitalism is a bitch, but you make it easier on many of us. Hugs
without a doubt one of your best works. I subbed when you had about 100 subscribers and its been amazing following you on your journey.
Joke's on you I'm already subscribed to the other channel
facts youtube trapped us
Thank you meat canyon
I know you talked about this before but it’s sad how content creators will look for that one big boom in there content which is what they all want but from there it’s an up hill battle it seems like more and more demands and people just want more and more from you just know there are those of us fans that want you to take your time for because the more you force something you love the less you start to love it
Voice acting is on point.
What's wrong with doing all that on this his first channel? That's the only part I don't get
Wow Meat Canyon is crossing 4th wall dimensions now!!
Unexpected but okay :)

Woah
OMGGG HI
Oh gosh
Bruh everyone turns into experts and critics in the comments, the way they talk and analyze in here, I’m surprised none of them got bachelors degrees in the topics they be saying 😂 calm down Einstein we don’t care if you’re smart, and half of y’all don’t even talk like this in person
This thing must be pretty uncomfortable to sit on.
when you gonna make a adventure time video
Step hen universe
Neat
Gayshlatt looking different
I love your second channel my guy
I just laughed my ass off haha I love you man!
You’re the only non gaming YouTuber who I watch constantly
YO That Spike was up his Azs!
I love you meat man, never change
Interested in a TV or streaming channe ?....you are one of the few ppl that deserve protection in case anything happen...Ever think about creating you personal network shows n more
When kids cartoons become so cursed your child hood becomes a nightmare
Your animations are less and less ugly and groteskue andI dont like it. I want to go back the rabbithole of wirndness and uglyness. I want you to destroy my childhood memories with oversexualised terrifing caracters! This is why we, strange smelly people here Btw good video
Those are some top tier stretch mark mate. 😂
You’re the best dude.  Keep it up
nice
I going to make your ass as bear ww her head 😂😂
Was Matt Watson one of the voices for the scary YouTube worm?
Lmao in less then 24 hours this is close to a mil
why
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wtf lmao
I could use that kind of stability right now...
Lmao
This is his best video
Jesus fucking Christ this made me laugh so hard.  And also, die inside. Slowly. Like a withering plant. Or a slowly dying star collapsing in on itself.  But I did laugh really hard!

Gotta love some 4th wall break
What the .......
Hey
This was beautiful
I was fr expecting Steven to come out from the sky and split Youtube in half lmaooo
I knew youd "ruin" steven universe
Me just staring at steven while trying not to cry
If you YouTube takes down this video it's canon
hahah, he sit on the youtube worm with thorns
This guy is so creative. (Coming from a black guy still in the trenches)😂
MAKE A CLARENCE ONE PLEASEEEE!
He finally lost it
It's hilarious he rides the YouTube dragon like the white Luck Dragon in the Never Ending Story. He even had the music playing from the film. Nice touch. 😊
Lmfao....the algorithm monster is dangerous
I'm surprised I haven't seen anything fnaf related on here
Algorithm
Yknow what, you could've made the gem look more infected, but you didn't. Good for you.
Best plug of all time
I feel like the gems would be able to run off any threat with this version of steven
ohh nooo
Why’s he look like David Berkowitz 😂
Its bad that u feel like r being forced to do something that u don't want to do
First lines: Gamzee
LMAO PLS this is not what I’m expecting.
Now this! This is how you get people to subscribe to a 2nd😂👌🏼✍🏼

🤣😂🤣👍 great stuff as usual Mr.Meat
I love you man! Take care of your self make this crazy shit when u can.
You got me to lol at "I'm glad I have to do this to survive"
The design of the YouTube creature looks like something straight outta the movie 9
Man, no one explained and convinced me so well to support a second channel
Traumatized me
I wanted steven universe tho
Disturbing as always
Now we need a cartoon where Ricky Gervais plows Will Smiths whole family.
We’ve all been hurt before weird YouTube algorithm snake death robot! But give Papa Meats second channel a chance! A chance I say!
Bill cosby but he is actually a sexual predator oh wait
You know,  I'd watch a cartoon about the fictionalized life of one Hunter,  aka Meat canyon.  100 percent.  Lol.    Gear video buddy!
The way he says belly🤣
You are the best thanks for your videos
Jesus I wasn't expecting a MeatCanyon jschlatt
Best. Commercial. Ever. And I grew up in the 80s. I know from commercials.
This is not what I needed to see the first thing in the morning
''Daddy did you wrong''... never ever gonna say that to kids..
Adventure time & amazing world of gumball next, uncle grandpa too
so this video was just an ad for the 2nd channel? was pretty sure there was already an announcement video for it.
Why the fuck IS THIS POSTED ON MY BIRTHDAY
GOOTTT DDAAYYUUMM
Nice
*why*
Was expecting PAPA instead of Daddy... Loved it all the same though.
Very clever.... fine I'll sub to your second channel...
Do you have a patreon or personal website because we need a full length version of that will smith and chris rock video.
For some reason i think he's being held gunpoint
What am I watching
Trash show regular show miles clear
It's been a while but I don't remember all this from Steven universe 🤔
You totally forgot to put your fans beating the door down for more videos
Feed the algorithm and my insatiable hunger for meatCanyon
Susan are you here ?!
I love the never ending story vibe the end  Has. Maybe you should just take old movies or cartoons snippets snippets and give them the meat Canyon twist
This may be a cry for help
Man it’s 7 in the damn morning man
Steven universe is so useless
NEXT UNCLE GRANDPA
A marketing god
You should make a whole Steven universe episode 👀
I'd love an asdf-styled MeatCanyon video - random 5-10 second bits the whole video.
Great self portrait man. Good job
I kinda wanted to see where the Will Smith and Chris Rock would have gone with this animation
I show your animations to everyone at work. Nobody's yet to be disgusted by your beautiful work. 😉
"That's true, I fall back on that alot actually." 😂😂😂
Just do a breaking bad animation ok ?
Do a clash Royale
I wish you'd talk to me like the algorithm does =(
Hey man, don't stress yourself out trying to keep up with us and YouTube. Your mental health physical health is paramount. We can wait.
The YouTube monster is real
Can you do Transformers next please?😁😀
Glorious, as always. ...But, like, no pressure, man.
The Will Smith one caught me off guard and made me crack up
He likes it when you call him daddy
I love how you handle artists block. YouTube algorithm monster is very pleased
YEEEESSSSSS
Meat canyon finally partnered up with papa meat😍
Let's Fly
The gem in his stomach is canonically his mother (an alien queen), and he hangs around a bunch of aliens that were her subjects and one that wanted to be her lover.  There’s lots of meatcanyon fodder in Steven Universe
Youtube algorythm lookin' submissive and breedable 😳
I love that even his video promoting his other channel is pretty funny. Keep up the good work, and remember to take care of yourself.
Simpsons
LMAOOOOO
Lmfao
We all appreciate the insight into the struggles of unique creation when it comes to youtube demanding constant uploads. We got your back! To the second channel! AWWAaaaayyyy….
Amazing
not what i expected but it was a welcoming surprise. lol your insane. I love it.
Thats so amazing... the end was a nice mix of childhood memories and perverse excitement.. great mix
"I'm glad I have to do this to survive" everyone's thought as they wake Monday morning. Taking the brief moment to check their bank accounts to make sure the direct deposit from last week went through.
lol😂😂😂
Youtube monster is that kodys voice 😂😂😂😂😂
stevevocado avocado.
Fucking brilliant
Oh god this is horrible
I’m with you!!!!
Take my hand and lets fly!
The first Papa Meat video I watched was Markiplier drinking milk while playing FNAF. After seeing his other videos and found out it's his legit second channel, I instantly subscribed and enjoyed his future videos <3
This is unironically one of the most creative ones yet.
The way the algorithm was animated was pretty metal
Godly
YouTube confirmed to be a vril memberberry brain worm
This video was actually hilarious
What the fuck kinda acid trip...
Do Adventure Time!
This is the context I needed
I hate the fact I drunk water during this🫣
This did not go as I expected
I feel so bad fot him feeling he must make nons top content to survivie ro with away into dust
Good ol *Papa meat* I sure do love *Papa meat* after all *Papa meat* is the best.
You are so brilliant.  I loved this soo much!
Papa, do what you need to do to keep your mental sanity. The YouTube algorithm grind breaks people down and It think most of us would rather see some content whenever then never at all.  From some random nobody on the internet, good luck.
steven universe?
This is gold.
Wait this channel ain’t that new I’ve been with papa meat for a while BUT YES I WILL JOIN YOU A SECOND TIME LET US GOOOOOOOOOOO
Stephen universe is trash but this is alright.
Is mat watson the YouTube snake?
Would love to see an Adventure Time recreation
Best click bait 😂😂❤️🔥
This is phenomenal
This was the 1st thing on the internet that I looked at this morning and it's made my day. Thanks! ☺️☺️

this was a trip and a half 🤣 love your channels, keep up the good work and take it easy

It is now Canon in the Meat Canyon universe, that Meat Canyon and the YouTube algorithm, fuck. That is all...
Me and my friends watch your cartoons like Saturday morning cartoons. Your vid are dumb funny and we refrence them constantly. Let us do voices for your toons?
Did not see that ending with a Neverending Story reference... Kudos
Meat Canyon is top notch..
Man how aren’t you working for south park or got your own show. You are to talented to be held back by YouTube.
You a genius
Pro, no homo, pro
is Oney voicing the Youtube creature?
This isn't... This dont feel good
DAMMIT WHY, I JUST FINISHED THE FIRST SERIES WITH MY GF. I LOVE YOU MEAT BUT ALSO HATE YOU (But mostly love :>)
The stretch marks are what makes it
I would handle your job very similar to you handling Suzan the snake lol
already in the second channel lol
I can't tell you how much I hate this but I love it so much at the same time
The Jawbreaker vids, Secret Formula and Sunrise - My three favs from you. I loved the gritty darkness
This is perfect marketing/video ☠ bro I'm done.
Somehow this makes my childhood better
papa meat, will you take on phineas and ferb? that would be awesome
I knew this would be a real gem
hi
Imagine if a bunch of Tumblr-tards had a hissy fit over the first sixteen seconds probably wont happen but it'd be funny
I never fought they could ruin him for me
Damn that relation
Is that Matt Watsons voice as the YouTube monster? Lol
MEEEAT, you should look up the 'don't you put it in your mouth' commercial
the never ending story.
Hey Mr Meat could you upload a cropped clip of this video with just the Will Smith scene? I need it for... reasons...
Nice to see the YouTube Algorithm make an appearance
Yes
Honestly I would rather deal with the stress of creators block than have to trudge into the slave drivers den for pittance as the wealthy over lords assess which one of us isn’t working fast enough whilst already burning out. “YOU NEED TO BE FASTER! ,MORE FOR LESS!, HARD WORK WILL PAY OFF FOR YOU! ” They screech with gnawing malice as they know they have no intention of helping you grow and if they break you another desperate gear monkey will take your place and you will be cast aside only to try and find another path laid with false promises from another employer like a giant angler fish hiding it’s true form in the abyss as it dangles hope in front of your face only to snap you up and force you into yet the same machine with a different name.
I’m glad that I didn’t see cursed pearl.
I'm surprised Papa Meat survived the skit, normal looking peeps never do in those.
🐴
It's better than the original
Didn’t have to think to hard to see the deeper meaning on this one. Stick it to ‘em papa
I love the design and animation of the robot snake thing. Pretty cool
This was goofy ahh
LMAO you good man?
no please no
Hear me out-- Ryan's toys reviews, but its like the Truman Show
Stretch marks on point
Meatcanyon has a great vocal range
I knew that’s what YT’s algorithm looked like
Oh what have you done now 😭
Man this is the second never ending story reference in the last 2 days it’s scaring me
Not only did he made steven cursed but also YouTube as well lol
It was going somewhere I like "sniff out some trouble" maybe he force fuses with anyone or anything he comes across. I wish I didn't know anything about Steven universe.  but maybe you will read this Meat Canyon and if you have You will find better Ideas then me. That I'm sure of.
This was an extraordinarily crazy good video.
This is what year 5 in quarantine would look like
Jschlatt with the balls for sideburns should be the next sticker in my mailbox
my favorite one thus far 😂
This was more powerful than witnessing a biblically accurate angel
Make something crazy like donald trump ruting a grape fruit, go south park and make celebs look shit xD.  But make it true in a way with a message...
I actually watch the second channel more than I do the first😅
But... But... I wanted Steven universe to die in a horrible way Papa Meat. :(
Schlatt animation was top tier and the laugh at the end was great. Thanks Hunter
That escalated weirdly... I mean, normally
Up!
That ride sure will be spiky.
Damn this was your best so far loved every minute of it .
I WILL
yEaH!? *in metal screeching voice
Oh no…
YouTube : I've been hurt before~ Pewdiepie : That's what you deserve, Don't let it happen again.
This is so dumb🤣 I love it😂
Doubling down on sexual tension and plot twists. This is what I subed for
Will Smith gave me Bugs vibes. And I liked it. I liked it a lot.
MeetCanyon doesn't make fail to entertain us.
This video is too meta.
Don't stop-not the algorithm
Lmao this video was something else
silly games?
Steven be looking thicc
Love it, it's good shit.
Make a Paula deen one
I fuckin love your swanky dark cartoons😂😂😂
plot twist: the gem in meatcanyon steven was just a toy but it got stuck and he couldnt take it out
Everything u make is brilliant 😭
good video. Why do you do a different voice for yourself lol
You should start a podcast or something
you sick freak... lol. awesome
Steven should be like “and here’s my belly” rubs gem “with mom~” that would be so uncomfortable
Meatcanyon your mental health matters. It's okay we love you
Fucking killing it man. Keep up the great work
I have to do this to  ''SURRRVIIIIVE''
I thought this was the weird sh/+ channel.
This is more Quality over Quantity
To the ends of the earth
wtf did i just watch.....
You improved a lot
Ok
It youtube that bad? Honest question
The deleted Steven universe episode:
I’ll join you
Jajajajajajaaaaa “dame la estabilidad que necesito para no poner un arma en mi boca”
not me watching him get sexual with a literal depiction on YouTube 😳😳
Making a toon of your own self making toons. I LOVE IT
This is so meta!
Metta
Trisha Paytas being a mutant piece of sludge that fell off nicacado avocado
I got clickbaited but in a good way
maybe you should stop, 🤢 youtube regulations sucks much more🤮 use odysee
I originally was thinking about not watching because I thought it would be a boring forgettable toon, but I realize now what it truly is, Self promotion!
i feel like the end was a never ending story refrance
What the f@ck did I just watch
Um I wanted more of that steven
DEMONETIZED
Yes this is youtube in our days
LMFAO
Do secret life of Alex Mac
Was this click bait to plug his second channel yes did we all love it yesss
LMAO I like this video <3  it is very witty and funny. Keep up the good work, already subscribed to 2nd channel. Peace <3
Fucking love this
The YouTube machine reminds me of the machines in 9
This went in a completely different way lol Yeeees ty for the neverending story reference that is genuinely my favourite film of all time.
Man just stop and give yourself a break!
Anyone else feel like YouTube looks like a Bobbit Worm?
Yes daddy meat
>.> Oi the will smith one was good :) do it properly
Buddy i mean llike.. woaw that was awesome
hiw do you come up with this
Please for the love of god be in the second season of smiling friends😂😂😂 make. It. Happen.
🤣🤣
this was the best self promo Ive ever seen
What a fuckin fever dream. I love it.
finally; i have a reason to hate steven universe without sounding homophobic.
Love it my guy been a fan since Pinocchio
I absolutely dispise that cartoon, S U.
I love how he shamelessly admits that he falls back on sexual tension
I've already subscribed 😭 I can't subscribe any harder
Too gross 😡
I liked the Will Smith idea 😉
Meats deep in the youtubeussy and Mr.Canyon's going for a ride. btw love the vid.
Though I've only watched a hand full of videos to which made me say wtf am I watching. Just have to say amazing work. 🤪😃😎🔥🔥
Make a animation video about Danny Gonzalez
Cool
Vote PAPA
I will be subbing.
The YouTube monster 😆😆😆
Meatception
Steven age 30
it's a good thing that i never have those kind of problems - Troll
weve all been waiting for this for many years
MeatCanyon ruining one childhood character at a time 😂
LET US GO TO THE SECOND CHANNEL
Oh great, now I need to go look at The Never Ending Story Rule 34 because of this, thank you for that, that is now my whole day.
Would LOVE a Steven Universe video where him and the gems groom kids and the normal townsfolk try their hardest to stop them
;
Each animation draws me further from reality, and god, but closer to retribution
TBH the original animation was already pretty disturbing considering the implications behind a lot of it.
"Give me a trendy topical idea that I may devour" *14 hours later* #3 on trending
Join the second channel today, kids! Papa makes some really fun stuff over there!
lol that ending reference to the Neverending Story. So synonymous with being a Youtube creator...you have to do it FOREVER!
I actually really like that sort of interdimensional cable vibe of the scraped ideas animated and briefly commented on.
My childhood ouch
Mmmm papa likes
You and Dunkey should team up. Who cares what you do but you 2 would be unstoppable
Love it! Great ! Great!    ...but can you finish the Steven Universe one? It was delicious papa
MeatCanyon senpai be riding that YouTube algorithm chan.
Dude, you’ve put out so much content in just one year, that if you took a couple months to catch a break, I’d still be here waiting on your subscribed list, no doubt. You work so frikin hard, and I respect the HELL out of your work as an artist, and writer. I’m going to subscribe to your other channel right now! Please, take care of yourself, a lot of us may just be internet strangers. However, trust me when I say that most of us just want you to be happy, and laugh along with you. Don’t ever feel like you have to push yourself over the edge for people. You rule Papa Meat! 👍
Oh my god I’m dying of laughter
so meta...
MeatCanyon is the only overweight person who draws themselves accurately.
W
Ffs wtf.🤬🤬🤬
The revolution is in progress..
Nice retirement
I feel like one day Papa meat is just going to die and then we're going to have to refer back to this video to see the deeper meaning that he was crying for help
Now this is epic
Hey can you ask youtube to bring back the dislikes
You are beautiful and schlatt is  a ballsack man
He is tryng to say us that youtube is pushing him🤣
0:37 Judging by what I’ve seen of him, his head should’ve been a bit more nugget shaped. Less like an upside down triangle and more like a block.
Daddy did u wrong😂
I love that he hopped on it and flew away like it was Falkor
Women want children or they will die so be ready for that.
The YouTube algorithm was really pleased with meat canyon creating a second channel. At the time of me viewing it's #3 on trending
I’ve been waiting for a vid like this eventually , and I’m happy for the wait!!
The ending gave me strong "Back to Tamriel" vibes and i dunno why
Fucking shriek laughing rn
Papa Meat
ㅎㅁㅎㅁ
I love you man. Everytime I see a new video drop I know my day is going to be a little bit better. Keep up the awesome work and don't let the pressure get to you. You're an amazing talent and a awesome human
cuarzo mamon :v
You should make more cartoons about your self lol
I love you papa meat keep up the great work
Genius to animation the pressure of not having an idea that feels worth to animate with the constant need of the algorythm!
Holy fucking shit....your the fucking man....your the fucking man. Fucking A Fucking A...getcha pull
I SHIP PAPA MEAT AND YT MONSTER MECHA!
Youtube: "Give me unique content that I can exploit in my algorithm."      Also Youtube: "Don't touch my algorithm, senpai......"
It’s ok bro we can give you a break so you can relax , we will still be here when you return
I was in awe at the nut schlacks
Lets all appreciate the amount of effort this man puts in his videos, amazing. Keep grinding bro, I love the videos
God fucking damnit this is the best one yet. I love you dude 😂
here they come
I will always see YouTube in this image from now on...  Thank you~
Now this is commentary
daddy did u wrong
Repent and trust in Jesus Christ to be saved from hell!
Could you animate drachenlord?
hey man  u ok ?
The greatest lowkey promo video for a second channel I have ever seen.
wtf did i just watch
Meatcanyon and YouTube? I ship it 😳
The best depiction of the algorithm ever depicted
I’ve been waiting for Steven universe since I found Meat on YouTube and this was beautiful
I think he's projecting how he feel about making videos on youtube
“And give me the stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth” damn that hits hard and no one noticed
This is the best clickbait ever
You should do one with My Hero Academia
We need more nightmare fuel videos. Make teletubbies v2.
OMG Meatcanyon really pulled off a clickbait title that turned out to be a smooth critique of youtube's ruthless Allie AI and ends up seducing it in the end all the while promoting his second channel. Bravo Papa Meats Bravo.
this is the perfect amount of funny and self aware, feel like if he made a show ts would be so entertaining
Christ he bitches alot.... It's not like he's scraping to get by. His patreon alone is bringing in great profit plus the store. If shits getting to you or you're feeling pressured take a God damn break....
How about a paw patrol skit
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Can highly recommend for everyone who hasn't been watching his second channel it's definitely worth
Fucking. Beautiful
Never have I been so glad to be click baited
Yep, youtube is like this RN
WTF
This got to be the most accurate YouTube algorithm representation
No
Clicked for the expected Steven Universe Ruination.  Stayed for the sight of seeing PapaMeat's face as he lovingly plugs his just-as-awesome 2nd Channel
This was one of the funniest videos you’ve had in awhile
🧡
Monster house part 2!?!? Monster tube!!!
meatcanyon. you're horribly amazing.
Love the never ending story reference 🤘
The Schlatt nutsack one is pretty funny
Number three trending let go
This was beautiful papa meat
Meat rules
Steven Universe's magical gem belly button has veins.
You look like Bobby hill with a mullet
Well that happened XD
"The stability I need to no put a gun in my mouth"  Amen.
I deeply unlike this
That’s how you make a promo! Even though is for yourself 😜
Thank you for not destroying Steven Universe
Meatcanyon, maybe you should do a philosophical video
Maybe a Jim Carrey animation
This is amazing.  I mostly like the part where it is amazing.
Ngl the stuff you think is bad is still leagued better than majority of channels keep up the content and don’t stress to much I mean we’re all hear for you papa meaty
Keeping it ong 100 frfr, i like your vids on the second channel more. You are just a funny dude and idk, your commentary shit is top tier.
Also do danny phantom next if you cant think of anything
Meatcanyon, you could make a place for people to give you ideas?
im honestly fine with waiting
Lmfao omg that meta though. Poor Papa Meatus and the toxic relationship/expectations ahaha
Ah, for a second there I thought he was going to have sexual congress with the Youtube Algorithm...                 I feel hollow now.
Number #3 on trending bro you are unstoppable do a video on NBA Younboy or any major rap artist your gonna get a number 1
Praise the algorithm.
The fact that he took the time to actually draw schlatt with nutsack sideburns is amazing
“Fourth wall break inside of a forth wall break, that's like sixteen walls” -ryan reynolds

Well that went in a freaking weirder direction that I figured it would. Multiple times. 😅

Actually. Nah. I won't. See you when you upload here though
da best I scared my neighbors with the demented demon cackle that came out.
Hunter you seriously make me fuckin crack up.
U Are Def A legend - U have more skill & Talent then a entire Team of paid staff.   If I had Mr beasts kind of money I’d set U up with a studio n whatever U wanted n just Say do what ever U want.  I’d like to see video games n movies with you’re type of vision.  If I could pull out some of the stuff out of my mind exactly how I see it all The time I Don’t  think i would. As the image of my profile pic suggests. I have seen things n some things are not meant to be seen by others. Not even my ideas out to paper. Keep doing what U Do.     I’d like to see MRBEAST GIVE YA A JIB BUT U WORK FROM YA HOME STUDIO.   That would be great.  I may not be rich even though many time I had chance. Just trusted wrong ppl w my ideas n they stabbed me in the back. It happens. Just Bad luck.     U keep Doing what U Do Though. Def every video makes my day & others as well. 😎👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i love ya hunter you make me laugh a ton
youtube algorithm tamed once again
if you don't like your current job I'm sure someone with your skills should have no trouble finding work in the fast food industry.
You beat that youtube algorithm into submission damn you!
I love when artists make fun of big companies.
I have an characters for ya Meat, try Mickey Mouse, Lazy Town, Barney the Dinosaur, Dragon Tales, Martha Speaks, Dexter's Laboratory, etc.  Many ideas, I hope you read this comment.
This is perfect no cap
#3 on trending!!
I love how he acknowledges how he makes his cartoons oddly sexual and proceeds to still do it 5 seconds after XD
I love watching your videos while I eat
the ending of this video made me cry, it reminded me of something, maybe a story
🤣🤣🤣 that was fucked
There's not enough sexual tension in the world today. I apologize, it's my fault.
LMAO J SCHLATT
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH ONE OF MY FAVORITE CARTOON NETWORK SHOWS
Bruh I love this 💯
PURE FUCKIN MASTERPIECE
Please expand on the jschlatt cookie tierlist
I didn't follow the second channel...but now after I heard 'lewd anime statues' that got me
Can you do a fireside chat with Tom Fulp?
algorithm
Please animate yourself more, it's hilarious and I'd love to see you make yourself a proper character
Sir, could you do Bill Gates please
I just finished this show today you monster
ARISE, YE MEAT MINIONS!
DID I HAVE A STROKE?!?!?!
I see the future and it it's League of Legends
https://youtu.be/1AFaxYIcgOE .
Meatcanyon makes cartoon network look like a tryhard parody.
Bro why is this #3 trending on YouTube 😥
Best ad ever
I hate steven Universe so fucking much
Why do you do this
This worked 3rd on trending
OH MY GOD I'M GONNA PUKE
I was so looking forward to a Steven Universe rip that could potentially be canon... But it was a click bait and switch.
I feel like the jschlatt and Steven universe bit was like content you never finished also how you portray your relationship with YouTube is entirely different from how most other conten tcreators
Is really make kid nightmare
You deprived us of the spank
The end remind me of when Goku has to go with Shenron at the end of GT
<3
"yeah I do fall back in that a lot"  Immediately builds weird sexual tension with YouTube algorithm monstee
I tried taking your hand, but....but.... MY DAMN THREE DIMENSIONAL HANDS COULDNT GRAB YOUR SWEET, SWEET, SUCCULENT TWO DIMENSIONAL HAND! WHYYYYY?????????
haha ya
i love you man
Watching this at 1 am really hits different
DADDY MEAT THE FUCK IS THIS
I’m subscribed to MeatCanyon’s 2nd YouTube channel, and you should be too!  GO! GO TO HIM!!
Currently this video is number 3 on trending 🤯 If you want the Algorithm to pick you just animated it😅
everything should end with a Falkor ride
> like it so much
Is it weird that I was looking forward to what the Steven universe one would be?
Really good one
Funny shit man, definitely will have a deeper look at the second channel
That YouTube algorithm monster is probably the funniest thing I have seen in a YouTube video!😂😂
His animation style reminds me a lot of Mr. Pickles
L
Women want children or they will die so be ready for that.
You make my favorite cartoons better
Didn’t expect this lol
CORYXKENSHIN
Oh my god is meatcanyon squared
Chris rock and will smith had me laughing
Papa meat is so talented man 😭
THE JSCHLATT CAMEO I CAN’T 😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
This hyper sexualised version of papa meat is unrealistic and gives me body dysmorphia
Very fucking funny.
I was about to comment MeatCanyon face reveal at the very beginning as a joke and then...
im glad you did not do my boy too dirty
I  HATE U MEATCANYON FIRST U RUINED ADVENTURE TIME THEN U RUINEEDD DEMON SLAYER THEN REGULAR SHOW ANNDDD NOWWWW STEVEN UNIVERSE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Porn is easier.
You want some ideas I got some
Wtf
He should have made fun of the really inconsistent art in the show by making the characters look slightly different every cut.
Ironic this is trending
Tf is this shit
......   Yeah, there needs to be a proper alternative to YouTube.
Low key that jshclatt video would have been fire
I love your personification of the algorithm. It just feels right.
You all better go watch some fucking Papa Meat. He is our daddy now. Don't you dare! Forsake! Daddy!
I thought we were gonna get steven universe
Aye bro, second watch today. You’re killing it, love papa meat too!
Amazing portrayal of the algorithm
Oh silly YouTube! Always stifling creativity with your authoritarian communist style content regime. Silly Willy!
Do a super mario video.
yo.... can like.... someone who knows this man please go check on him.... maybe give him a good hug or some shit....? #ConcernedBro lol
man is a genius
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The actual….WTF!
Have you completely fucked up gravity falls yet?
That’s not real YouTube serpent, real one TAKES money ceaselessly unlike this one  “Join me won’t you?”  Cant join what isn’t real
Therapist : "Every dream has a meaning" Meatwhile, My Dreams : [3:07]
Youtussy 🥴🥵🔥😈
Was I baited to watch an ad
Wish this was a series.
yo This is trending number 3 on youtube been proud of you meatcanyon
Is that. . . A Neverending Story reference? ?
THE FOURTH WALL?! YOU DARE BREAK THE FOURTH WALL?!  You savage, I love you.
For only women can Love there husbands not men, sayith the Old Testament God of Destruction who used the flood to kill everyone.
would love to see you ruin gravity falls
Man I wanted a Steven universe parody
"You make it sound like odd sexual tension" Hunter : "Eh, that's true I fall back on that a lot. You got me there !"  _A creator that makes fun of himself is a creator that I wholeheartedly respect, Good Job, Meat._
Poor Schlatt, man...     Would've thought the *BAWLS* would be beefier and girthier. My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day, is ruined.
This is great content, fucking stand of applause
My wife and I just said goodnight to each other after watching this video and instead of saying “I love you” and “I love you too” we said “I love meat canyon” and “I love meat canyon too.” Thanks for everything!
YOUTUBE IS A SNAKE ROBOT? My life is a lie...
man I was hoping for some shot talking Steven universe, but I found something better
Feel like I’m on crack
._.XD
True MeatCanyon Canon
Do another Anakin video
i like that he made a video ab the algorithm and its top trending
He made Steven universe look like the son of Sam killer
Nooooo not Steven
downfall soon
a
Jschlatt my beloved
Trends
Ah..thank you Mr. MeatCanyon, for all that you do.
yes!!!!
Equal parts fun, sick and entertaining.
Meat admits that he overuses the slow sexual tension thing 😮
Legendary plot twist.
"Yeah"
Hey Papa Meat, still waiting for that Gilligan's Island parody.
😂😂😂
Beú
I love the never ending story reference at the end
I couldn't get into Steven Universe, such a shitty show, but if this was how the show was I would love it. His character in this video looks like Danny McBride
Ugh. This is total garbage. 🤮 MeatCanyon’s work is so derivative and boring. If I were him, I would just give up on animating and put in applications at the Home Depot. I hear they have great benefits. . . . . . . . . . . . Do I have your attention, Hunter? I’m counting on it. Because if you’re anything like me (and I think you are), you probably appreciate, but mostly ignore all of the copious positive comments you get about something you’ve created and instead just hone in on any negative ones, even if it’s just one or two. I don’t want you to do that. Because it’s important for you to know that you are one of my biggest artistic influences and your work brings so much light into my life. You are the only creator that I faithfully stop whatever I’m doing and go to watch what you’ve uploaded the moment I see the notification pop up. You don’t need to kill yourself to fulfill the YouTube algorithm and you don’t ever need to doubt yourself or your abilities. You didn’t get where you are now by chance. You have the loyal following you do because you, sir, are oozing talent. And I need you to know that and not ignore it when literal thousands of people are telling you it’s so. You’re good enough just the way you are. Although I understand the drive to always want to do better. But it’s clear how hard you are on yourself and it makes me sad that you maybe don’t see what everyone else so clearly sees in you. Thank you for doing what you do. I’m grateful for any shred of content you post, no matter how long I have to wait for it. It’s always worth the wait! Keep it up, brother. You’re fucking awesome and I love ya!! 🖤🤘🏻
For if she does not call you Lord, she is not Wife material. Saith Old Testament God of Destruction, who used the flood.
The gospel is simple. Jesus Christ, who is God in human form, died on the Christ for your sins of every person. He was buried and rose again three days later. Eternal life is a free gift. Its recieved, by faith (trust) in Christ alone. Its not earned. Jesus said in John 6:47, Truly, truly, I say to you, he that believes (trusts and surrender) in me has everlasting life. Trust Jesus alone and forever live! God bless🙏
This might just be the greatest thing I've ever seen as an ad.
YouTube is evil!!!
This was fun, good shit lol
Amazing... You are GODS
God, you’re a fucking genius
You made a killing
This is so META
Love how the video talking about how the YouTube algorithm screws him is top 3 on trending
People with more traditional jobs: I wish I just animated goofy, experimental YouTube videos all day instead of toiling away at a job I don’t enjoy…  YouTube animators: I wish I had a more “traditional” job that pays me consistently just for showing up and doing my work, rather than fighting tooth and nail for every last penny I get from the insatiable algorithm…
Steven Universe = nickado avocado
It’s honestly sad how many people also have to go through with the YT algorithm
Ah man, nothing but the best ! :)
I'm just glad that Steven universe skit didn't go where I thought it would
HELP NOT SCHLATT I’M CRYING
Yo bruh meatcanyon is hella confusing but God fucking damn it! He is the best animator on YouTube 👍
This is trending #3!
Lmao awesome plug!
Yeah…yeahhh
We can all relate!
I will always take your hand bro
This is one of my favorites!
I love you
He broke the algorithm🔥
Every fucking video I'm like "okay, I know what to expect. I know what's coming". Then there's this shit
#3 trending on YouTube
I’m about to make your ass as bare as her head😂 that was hilarious
This man made me simp for youtube

Drawing the “big guy” is the best thing I’ve ever seen
You know they're a badass with a mullet like that
1:55 falling back on sexual tension. 2:00 immediately using sexual tension. Love you papa meat 💕
This was so...good. took my breath away from sheer laughter
Sorry it took so long my guy but disabled the ad blocker on your channel. Forgot it was on, but love ya Hunter
SOO BASICALLY CHILDHOOD RUIN
Best ad I’ve ever watched and only ad I’d rewatch
MeatCanyon you've done it again I'm with you all the way tho some of your animations are horrific they are still amazing
We needed Jeff bezos
And its on trending, it worked amazingly
Meta
Dope sauce ... I needed that ...
I like how the youtube monster is made of diamond play buttons
I honestly love the design of the YouTube algorithm monster. It’s so badass.
that was so fucking good
Holy shit i somehow feel compelled to go to the other channel and subscribe, thank you and take this potato 🥔
This is great but I want an actual Steven universe cartoon
Not Steven universe catch strayyyyys🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude this is so fucking good
This is your best one yet.  Do us all a favor and keep surviving.
I love that this is number 3 on trending lmfao second channel sub earned
That Was not what I expected when I clicked on this video. Have I been ClICkBaItEd
What it meant to evoke a Bobbit Worm?
Mmm yes the finest Falcor reference
The amount of honesty and truth in this one is just as raw like the rest. Subbed for life (to the second channel too of course).
THE THIRD WALL BREAK SHOOKETH ME TO MY ROOTS
That just looks like a normal Steven universe fan
I was expecting him to fuck the YouTube machine #cursed comment  ((Make sure to take a break then and their meatcanyon! Can’t over stress yourself with theses animations!
advertising  crap cringe 10/10
Friggin' LOVED this one dude, beyond hilarious and on point!
What equipment do you use to animate and draw
I really dislike this, what the absolute fuck my guy
Kinda sad tbh ngl. I wish we can go back like the good old days
_Under 60 seconds it got _*_meta_*
Rebecca Sugar has left the chat …
Pretty sure we all started laughing at that last part like Meat was.
The fact that only you can be this weird and so fire at the same time is why ur the goat 😭💯 nobody else could replicate content like this and get the same reactions
No
For what he draws. he is wholesome as fuck
Plz bro, make the will smith slap chris rock A s s animation :c
The "yeah...?"  GOT ME LMAO
Next vid : amber herd dropping a grumpy
Absolute king

I'm glad I have to do this to survive!!!!!!
Cringe
What the fuck did I just watch.  I love it but-  It went in every direction. And that is the best part.
You should do parodies of nature documentaries that are short and about a specific animal. You can do it with animals or celebrities!!
love this
Still a better ending than the series finale solving wars with hugs and mental illnesses with hugs...😂😂😂
Just gonna put this out there, could make a roblox skit? Like you did with mincraft. Just an idea..
All the budget went on meat’s beard
Michael Jackson nose pink boy.
This shit is hilarious

Should definitely do a power rangers one 😂
I loved this show so much as a kid. What the fuck am i watching 🥲
This is the best ad I've ever seen
daddy has control over the YouTube algorithm monster machine thingy-
Respect. This will convince me to watch your second channel more.
When are we getting that will smith video though?
I love how it's now on trending
This is one of the best watch to like ratios I've ever seen..
I forgot I was already subscribed to the second channel and I still cliked the link
Even your announcements are good
The bground pretty doe
The Oscar’s bit had me dying
why did you make will smith sound like papa kratos? 🤣🤣
Quality > quantity
This is the most wildest and funny one yet, I love how the title and thumbnail was deceiving the video starts off with a parody then just spits out random shit but in the best possible way
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo no oooooooo
Did you do your own background work??
Pro: Meatcanyons videos are getting better Con: Meatcanyons videos are getting better
Red flag 🚩
Anything IS possible through friendship, and I mean, anything
Do something about johnny deep
“F*** the noise”- Issi youtube’s a joke needs fixed.
haha funny predictable joke about the hellscape known as deviantart
Taking your hand but it detaches pulling out parasite attached to your severed hand.
Great video love your content
God I love this man
THAT SCHLATT SKIT WAS THE FUNNIEST SHIT!
WTF XD
My man’s number three on trending because of the video promoting his second channel and I couldn’t be happier.
This was a good one
What the fuck
Lmao your good anything you do is amazing 👏 💕
Ladies and Gentlemen:This is how you deliver a presentation
Don't put a gun in your mouth! We love you!!! 🐻❤
Am I still allowed to put a gun in my own mouth?
love ya man
Steven kinda looks like you
okay but now i really need to see where that steven universe bit was going...
Meatcanyon will ruin everyone's childhood at all costs. This is actually what happens when Meatcanyon is in the process of making videos
This is the craziest love story ever
3 on trending wtf.
"JSchlatt but his sideburns are balls" 🤣🤣 what??
Lol 😆  I'm high af 🤣 watching this
Dude, i have not once said, "Meatcanyon needs to hurry up with his next video" They show up when they do, and when they do, the timing is always perfect.
I am destroying my ass on the toilet right now
I feel bad for any guy who watched this show and "grew from it." This was a show written to basically tell young men they are useless in society and that they should ask lesbian space women to do everything for them.
lol what the fuck
Best thing is that this is #3 on trending
Hey Papa Meat, I want to say that I really enjoy your horrifically awesome animations!  If you're feeling burnt out, the majority of us will understand. You shouldn't feel pressured to keep making content as fast as you normally do. Quality stuff takes time, and most of us understand that!  Thanks for another banger vid :]
Vegeta eating good in that clip!
Yeah I believe youtube is that bad for creators
My childhood
This was such a smooth way to advertise. The "Daddy's here" an then the "yeah?" SENT ME💀💀💀💀
Pretty big belly👍
Heyy
Jokes about making something trendy, ironically is #3 at the time of this comment.
Papa meat subscribe to him
Yay
Do one for teen titans
Cream Crew podcast episode #70 confirmed?!?!?!
Thanks for your stuff lol
This got real pretty fast
That "uhng I've been hurt before" kind of sounds like Chris O'Neill
Love it
Number 3 in trending 💀💀💀
That's what Susan Wojckikikicchkikchjikiki actually looks like.
YouTube will kill us all
Sad to see what youtube does to people.
Oh dear….
love the way you animated Jschlatt PERFECTION
I like how everything in the background looks beautiful except for steven
The fact I started back watching this show this week and the view count is 666k 😅
No 3 on trending lol 😂
The fact that this currently has 666k likes just goes perfectly for how this video is going.
HUZZAH!!!!
heres an idea: caillou
Fuck'n GOLD. HAHAHA
The YouTube robot design is unnecessarily awesome.
I was so glad when it cut away from the Steven universe idea lmao
666k views
Watched this, and I was the 666k view. Scary
This is outrageous.
You know I really should have expected this to be next with that one elden ring animation giving a guy gems to put in his belly and honestly your probably could have made a better rendition of this then the creator, the only good thing to come of this show is the porn there is quite a bit of the blue one (Lapis) either being a complete slut or railed into oblivion.
Well youtube algorithm confirmed that this worked, now that its 3 on trending
Papa Meat is an angel disguised as a guy
I almost passed this absolute gem by because I don't watch Steven Universe and wouldn't get the references
Steven universe was my favorite show like adventure time and after the adventure time one I was wondering when you was going t9 get steven
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was just watching one of my old unlisted steven universe edits  perfect timing
I really like how you made youtube look and sound
Jesus 😂
I think the most meta thing about this is that it's trending... the algorithm is on his side.
Jokes a aside… The World needs Papa Meat to give Ezra Miller (voiced by Flashgitz Tom 😉) a good spanking 🖐🏻
Funny thing is Hunter is actually far more attractive then he draws himself. Lol
the crystal is the only normal thing about this
Lol
"Jschack"
Hell yeah YouTube wurm!
Thanks for being weird
THE SECOND YOU SAID WILL SMITH SMACKING CHRIS ROCKS ASS I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENT FOR YOU TO ANIMATE WILL SMITH SMACKING CHRIS ROCKS FACE LMAO
Gotta respect how "Meta" Papa Meat went here.
fever dream
bts is an idea
This man is goated he is one of the greatest of all time 😊
I love in animation world when the animator appears and gets all meta. Classic. Ty !
After seeing this video, I think that you should do 3 of the following things: 1.  Do Gumball. 2.  Please do Gumball Watterson. 3.  For the Love of God of Wine, please do The Amazing World of Gumball.
❤ U Papa Meat 🍖 😊
This got number 3 on trending it’s making fun of the YouTube algorithm 😂
Falkor looks SHARP.
The Neverending Story reference at the end tho and the trendy topicals idea  MeatCanyon is Top Tier Content
You should make an animation of the life of a frog
Its funny that it makes fun of the youtube algorithm but its number 3 in trending
Meatcanyon drawing Meatcanyon takes a whole new level
huh
Finally, good advertising
So when are we getting Youtube Algorithm Rule 34 content?
I hate the YouTube algorithm
I love this channel. Been a fan since the first Jawbreaker video.  I hope you keep on making great videos. I love you dad. I hope you make more Anime papa meat shirts, I missed them the last time
Jshlatt’s muttonchops be lookin 👌
Love it dude
Love my childhood being ruin by you dude!
Criticizes YouTube but still gets 3rd on trending, maybe there is still some hope
Still better than the real show the real show sucks
I love how he had an idea about not having and idea.
First time I cringed at his videos in a while but I loved every second of it
#3 on trending  Ironic
XD "Daddy did you wrong..."  XD OMFG!!!
YOU DIDNT☠️
this is fucking gold
HAHAHAHAH OH MY GOWD
Fuck yeah bro, I'm here for the fuckin ride
Bear and the big blue house. The moon is a god. And needs sacrifices.
wah I have a youtube channel
"... and give me the stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth..." Jesus I lost it at that
This is so MEATA, thank you for all you do Papa.
I dread you
This is art in its purest form
Comment for the algorithm monster
This might my new favorite video MeatCannon's ever done love what you're doing love Pappa Meat
I'LL JOIN!!! I'LL JOIN!!!!!!!!!!
Yes please gawd whisk me away lol
Love how this is on YouTube trending, not just on trending for “gaming”
Didn't know Steven Universe is MeatCanyon
We love you meat man
Oh boy
man will smith spanking chris rock would have been the most lit shit ever
god
wait.... if you cant think of content for 1 channel how is starting second channel gonna help? wont that require you to upload twice as much content? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Mannnn I really wanted to see rest of that Steven universe video
I love how the ending rant sounded like a randy marsh speech
I will, for the stability.
"I'm about to make your ass as bare as her HEEEEEEAD" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
#3 ON TRENDING
What happend to steven -
How does This guy have the mind set to make these.
😂😂
This was the most loving,inspirational, and open minded video I've seen in a while. Like. Sideburns as ball sacks? God damn it Meaty you've done it again,this was amazing. I almost jizzed in my pants. Can you make a video of Uncle Grandpa doing sum really sexy,big,hunky baby daddy type shit next?😩 Love you daddy!!!!!!
Didn't even care enough to make an actual SU one, I'm so glad, I already hate SU
The funniest thing is how this particular video ended up on trending. Lmao.
Imagine youtube commented on this video saying "wait im married to meatcanyon?!"
wonderful
WHY DID THIS COME UP ON ASMR!?
Lolll
Hunter. Awesome video idea. You got great content, dude. Keep it up or else.
Damn it, it's a ad. I wanted to see a fucking cursed Steven universe comic :(
I love how the thumbnail is the very first part of the animation so you don't get any spoils
Oh no. YouTube became sentient...and it hungers for more.
So much incredible awe inspiring content
Love the content on both channels Hunter. Keep up all the great work.
1:33 Well yeah Will he was on stage when he said it
love this channel
Youtube has become trash.
i just want sweet animation goodies, not introspection. IM PISSED OUFFF
Lmao rip every kid who sees this
Ok, now this is really dark
To be fair, Steven Universe doesnt need MeatCanyon to be creepy.
i rly like the voice for the youtube algorithm monster
No
You are my dopamine Meat Canyon, so I will never let you, no matter how the content would change or whatever decision you take to your channels, everything you do is so unique for me, not for the content itself, but because of you, you are what makes it so unique
Yet another masterpiece
Ayo MeatCanyon.... Thank you for being you
Cursed :)
im just confused as to what this has to do with steven universe besides the beginning 😭
Dude, if you're out of ideas for cartoon parodies then make your own things. As much as I've enjoyed your parodies, Monster Lab remains my favorite content you made so far. And I definitely want to see more of your own original stuff.
Everyone of these videos show that meatcanyon affects time by making their videos take forever
OH GOD HES REACHED STEVEN UNIVERSE
love all of this and you the GOAT YouTube animator... I wanna see everything through the Meatcanyon lense but I'd love to see your renditions of all the Crystal gems haha
Did it hurt to sit on the youtube algorithm monster? It looked painful.
Stop please I want to feel joy
what is this acid trip
What a weird inception style that was. Wasn’t prepared for it but loved every situation that was happening ☠️
Ok, I now wanna see a animated Neverending story of Falkor
Will Smith: Looking like double wide surprise...
Never ending story
This is possibly the scariest video he's ever made, for it is the most real.
Les go.
He burst through the metaverse
should do a rendition of monster house
WHO THE F**K SEXUALIZES THE YT ALGORITHM?!?
This seems like an unhealthy relationship
shit got deep
The Y.A.M. is my new favorite thing
Jesus Christ it’s insane how much subs you have now I’ve never legit peeped till today. All deserved too. Legitimately has passed up some of my old favorites who animate/animated some crazy stuff. You rock man, you ALL do.
r/NothingIsSacred
Jesus he's touched steven universe what childhood character is next!
This one’s better than the original
𝚆𝚃𝙰𝙵
The way you talk to the yt algorithm is the same energy as old man nebbercracker in “monster house” talking to his house monster of a wife
THIS GOT ME CRYIN :(((((
idk why this came to mind but hear me out that meme where it the kid in his room playing games or something while the parents fight in the background and it was labeled asmr or something casual home noises asmr but your next door neighbor is papa meat born in and comes from the Meat Canyon himself
A skit about how Cold One’s would be clutch!
More like MetaCanyon
😶 uh don't smoke kids 🚭
Didn’t need to be on topic for me to click
I felt that laugh
I fucking love you u God damn mad lad
"It feels like odd sexual tension" "well that's true, I fall back on that a lot you got me there." Instantly falls back on odd sexual tension
Why does his videos get more cursed everytime i watch him
Already a papa meat sub my dude 😘
OMG
Great great video I love it
You okay bro
this is oddly wolesome and dark at the same time XD
GIVE ME MOREE
Joined.
I seriously coudn't hear the vídeo for laughing so loud kkkkkk
Mmm
patrocinated by HappyMeatFarm
That was a trip.
Love how this is a plug to Papa Meat
Philip DiFranco
He just ruined my childhood.
Damn. Writer's block is real with this one. Hope you get your groove back man.
Kimda wanna see that slap scenario play out...
Better hope Reddit doesn’t find out about his drawing
dang youtube algorithm lookin HOT whats yo pronouns you data hungry sorting algorithm
Finally Steven Universe not being boring af
it went from a steven universe trashing to a youtube smashing....
I want a MeatCanyon movie
Ngl, I thought he was gonna have sex with the YouTube algorithm
So thats the image that you have from yourself and ytb. its sad that ytb needs uploads or ur channel dies we see the lack of creativity due to the restrictions of ytb and content around the world i hope ull get better meatc
I laughed really hard when he said give me the stability to not put a gun in my mouth🤣 2:53
Ah man i wanted to see the end of that will smith thing
god i love this video
I like how he had to ride that YouTube algorithm like he was riding falkor
I’m scared
I find it really funny bc I was watching Steven universe then I see this
Holy Jesus what the piss is this
This is a cry for help
what have you done
meatcanyom saved me from cancer
For some reason I thought it would end with the YouTube machine devouring you with a pan to other channels it's consumed...or something. Loved the honesty at the end tho lol whatever it takes, right?
is this like a riff off of the pooh bear video?
Wtf is happening
But I’ve already joined, I guess I’ll join again.
I'm pretty sure this is how Dragon Ball GT ended.
ok ok it worked
I KNOW YOU DIDN’T DO MY DUDE STEVEN LIKE THAT MEATCANYON🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This brightened my day of educational dread.
Jshlatt so funny 10/10
Dude u ruin my childhood
way to ruin Steven Universe that was show is a work of art way to ruin it
JOIN THE PAPA MEAT CRUSADE!
POWER PUFF GIRLS DO THAT
I like how meatcanyon look all normal lol
G.O.A.T type vibes! 😂😂😂
This was pretty disappointing. I really wanted to see what you’d do with Steven Universe. Oh well.
Papa lives to fight another day....
I love you man and your videos are always the highlight of my day when I see a new one has come out and I hope you never feel rushed by your fans to get content out
Honestly making a video about his writers block was brilliant, instead of being stopped by it he embraced it. And it’s a very dark kind of hillarious that he made us aware that his second channel is the only reason he hasn’t ended himself 💀💀
I think this is the most wholesome video of yours
The voice acting/editing on the YouTube algorithm monster abomination is amazing 😂
Do the nesquik bunny 😂
I love how you turn the stress of coming up with steady videos into a video itself.
Genius artist, awesome
He looks very similar to “son of Sam”
Perfectly depicts Steven universe
Fun Fact: Susan Wojcicki did the voice of the YouTube monster
Do you really have your keyboard right in front of your tablet? Doesn't that like, don't your like wrists hit that? Or like, doesn't your lower back hurt having to lean forward that extra little bit? I've never tried that set up.
Speaking of sexual tension, uh, you and YouTube ok?
the worm thing is literally The Destroyer of Worlds lol
Ok 😚
The fact that you took your time to meticulously animate every hair on your beard chin thing
Br-uh That's all I gotta say, that's amazing
Kinda wanna see the Will Smith thing, please and thank you.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM2Suu5_cH5RICv15iXJ28g/videos
I'm a fan of steven universe , I am a fan of this too.  Loving it Meaty ! 😍
I love you meat
"I'm glad I have to do this to survive!".....MeatCanyon you crazy b#@tard you've done it again! Thank you for the laughs, YT algorithm you better treat this man right because his channels are freaking awesome ^_^
How much fun did you have animating yourself in a questionable relationship with youtube???
I wish it wasn’t such an ad for you second channel but this was one of the funniest sketches so far
Was hoping this would be left alone but glad it wasn't at the same time
Oh okay, so no Steven?
Meat daddy works so hard on all of his content for us, it makes me sad to think how many of his videos have been demonetized
Bro you need to pitch some ideas to AS, they picked up smiling friends, there’s no reason why they would turn you down.
Man this is something else
Don’t look at this video like another joke look at it like the struggles of a man trying to come up with ideas while also making money off YouTube while also having fun with his life we love you meaty boy do your own thing in your own time we respect you
Maybe something about moon knight
I love this site but hate the people in charge
Riding the Youtube algorithm like its Falkor from The Neverending Story was the best thing I've seen today
Ion understand yall weirdos saying his vids ruin ur childhood or turn in into something sick and twisted like fuckin really? U mus got mental problems bc it seems like jus a video for me.
Comment
I SHALL JOIN YOU 🇺🇸🇺🇸🫡🫡🫡🫡
Idk about you guys but I feel so much more connected to the community he has created in his second channel. You're missing out if you haven't subscribed and watched the weekly stuff!!
No
Go on cold ones with maxmofoe and chad PLS!!
Did they actually get schlatt for this?
Thank you Daddy. Love the second channel, very cool and good.
What n the YouTube algorithm 🤣
How many lewd anime statues? Asking for a...  just wondering.
How do you make 3 minutes feel like 1 hour
wtf
Ok but can we talk about how cool the YouTube design was? I’m in love with it
Last night I had a dream about my dog had the same voice as Steven and he looked like your version of Scooby doo lol
2:32 - sound like Ethan kinda
what the hell kinda chicken nuggets am i eating?
I'll leave a comment cause I know some shitty bot will respond. But this video... Is so far the most interesting to me... Words can't describe it, and I'm being serious
2:50 📸🤨
Me pressing on it and seeing it’s the same channel I was already subbed to💀
Boo Coo Space Jam season  Steven Universes big belly.  This is officially a trilogy.
WHAT IS WITH THE “finally its here” bots. Can someone explain?
I’m sorry but is the YouTube monster… MATT WATSON FROM SUPERMEGA??!!?
I was subcried and I didn't know
🤣🤣 the entire thing was a papa meat promo
Will your second channel be called VeganCanyon? 🌱🤣👍🏻
0:27 I don't know why but I loved that little jiggle he added to his neck 🤣😂 Shit's hilarious
this guy is sick and perverted and im here for it
. . A h
Aww ☺️ a good ending. I do dislike how YouTube does pressure creators to consistently upload, but I do enjoy your second challenge a lot! The Reddit posts, the drawing along and your fun adventure blogs are all wonderful. Keep it up!
Haha I get it
Brilliant as always
Reminded me of the movie Adaptation
Bruh 😂😭
Wtf why you fuckin the youtube worm??
But really tho, the second channel is often just as good as the main
Hunter, all I'm hearing is "I want money. Youtube isn't giving me enough money and this is thier fault"
what about... Steven giving birth to pink Steven as an homage to the episode where white diamond pulls out Stevens gem?
"Give me the stabity I need to not put a gun in my mouth."  Bro, I felt that.
Damn, didn't expect this one to get so meta, I actually thought you were gonna rip Steven universe a new one. But as usual, I love it, you go MC, never stop destroying our childhoods.
aaand there goes my childhood
I hate it, great job
I was so ready for a SU parody
Wow
Is this an April fools video
No one gonna talk about the ending or I ain’t scroll enough?
Steven Universe is a beta male surrounded by a bunch of dyed hair feminists
You should do a video of everyone who plays GTA online and constantly complains about it, people who can't find anyone to play with (me), and people who have no idea how to play.
I've never cared or watched Steven universe so I'll just belive that is actually him.
We will ,pls just another bugs bunny video 😭
Unrelated I got into Harvard!!!
Where is SU parody tho🥲
Wow, surprisingly not a freak show video, but a promotion of a 2nd channel.
Do one on Tyrone Magnus that would creep him out hahahahah
He really broke the 4th wall🤣 AWESOME!!!!!
Damn bro this callarts style goin crazy
This was an amazing ad for ur second channel 😂😂
Don't stop being awesome . . .      Or else.
I was expecting steven universe
Interesting
What the hell  Back in my day we just read books and watched Andy Griffith and Little Rascal
LOLOLOLOL
already subscribed to it been subscribed too it
That was the best video to ever explain why an artist needs a break from the norm. Always enjoy whatever shitpost you come up with regardless of style, trend, or cringefactor
Hello
Papa Meat sexually consoling YouTube Worm whos voiced like StarScream is pretty weird, even for this channel
He’s the only one that can make promotions enjoyable
I will join you
Omg, i love you MeatCanyon.
Dude I’ve been here since you’re Yugio animation and it’s amazing to see your animations go from static character with only mouth movement to fluid character movements and new environments.  But I will say if you need to take a break then give yourself some time.
Will part: ❤️
If you got trouble figuring shit out Mr Meat. Don't worry! We will love you regardless!
Steven’s Universe one is perfect. That’s exactly how I see it.
This is better than the actual show Haha
Do coursge the cosradly dig
The little mermaid but her scales are actually the lost souls of ursalas victims
worst show on cn
This is beautiful
That last "SURVIVE" had a little bit of extra something on it there at the end.
Subscribed
The, "I'm glad I have to do this to survive" made me cackle so take my upvote. TAKE IT AND GROVEL YOU PEASANT. <3
Good video looking forward to day drinkin
You should do sonic
I think he’s trying to tell us something
It shouldn't be this way. Creators are suppose to please the viewers, not a computer program.
Wtf I love it
Favorite part 3:15
Thanks. I hate it.
where is the anime girl statue on your animated desk hunter?
Awesome introduction to your second channel.
lol cool
Dude I have an idea for u, make FNaF hella disturbing!!!!!
Of course there's odd sexual tension between him and the youtube algorithm
Probably a channel that does a podcast with flashgitz would be a good idea ,yeah I'd  watch that.
Man I don't even know what I'm watching now.......
This is art
New video idea so he doesn't die: gumball and darwin
the stability to not put a gun in my mouth.  lol that hit home.
Lord 🧍🏽‍♀️PLEASE 😂😂
You need help bro
Meatcanyon pls no
The stretch marks… lmfao.
Legit, MC, thank you for drawing yourself as lifelike as possible. Your self-awareness makes the joke a total home run. That’s turning the proverbial knobs right to 11. Godspeed.
Meat canyon animates meatcanyon animating Steven universe
Better than the original
😧

You deserve at 15 min spot on adultswim cause this ..this was awesome
Also most brilliant self plug ever 😆
Hey guys its time to bleach our eyes again
I fall back on that a lot, you got me there.
Lol
fucking incredible
Imagine if YT see 's this and comment: wtf
Anyone else disappointed he didn't show Jada Pickett-Smith as some grotesque monster.
Hi
Papa Meat came back from the sabbatical GUNS BLAZING
man admits to falling back on sexual tension and dives straight into sexual tension, love this guy
I want coryxkenshin to see this
Did jontron kill his YouTube controller or did Jacque?
The Never Ending Story reference at the end...magnifique!
Never Ending Story too?  My God....
That is one of my fav MC cartoons now
Thank you papa
Someone who is a millionaire, drop into papas patreon and give that boy $1,000,000
Phuck YouTube Mr. Meat should have his own website
What was that
been watching your second channel my man.
Great video. I enjoy meta comedy like this. Hope you stay strong and happy Papa Meat. We all love ya no matter what or how often you make content.
Jokes on u I already subscribed
Hey Susan you need to let papa meat take care of you. You’ve been working hard go enjoy yourself a good ol’ fashion hog
No gun in the mouth today, good sir – for you _and_ me :D
Good to see “shlatt” made a cameo.
This dude is a legend. A certified legend
Lol this guy understands my childhood and helps me to live on.
A surprisingly wholesome fever dream
Eventually every childhood show will be taken and I can’t wait to see them all
NOT STEVEN UNIVERSE BRO😭😭
Can u do will smith torturing oscar 😈😈
Oh alright
this is the one i was waiting for 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
Oh my god you did it
This is beautiful
Just wanted to let you know I hate that I love you
this is fucking amazing
wtf did i watch lmao
To be fair, doing anything with Steven Universe would be unbearable to almost anybody
Bro someone have to show this to coryxkenshin
thanks for the work bro
I've recently discovered the 2nd channel and it is f***ing Gold!
We are proud of you papameat good job on everything
wow
the meta-ness is making my brain hurted
If you run out of ideas, just know I'm chopping my balls off if I don't get a Phineas and Ferb vid by the end of the year. Have fun
i love how this is your artists block bro- the creativity of cartoons can be freed
This boutta be taken down I swear
Wtf
He finally animated himself 😂
...
WHY YOU GOTTA DO STEVEN LIKE THIS😭😭😭😭
The crystal gems really changed after era 3
Adult Swim needs you but I love your artistic freedom here😭😭😭
Do harry potter
*love the video* .
This man right here I love him legit fav youtuber 😄
god dayum, this one stroke hard, I respect meatcanyon, and the way he represents how media exploits content creators by forcing them to upload if they don't want to lose popularity, but that makes the content decrease it's quality because the content creator isn't as motivated. Also, pretty trippy the last part XD.
I love the never end story reference at the end
Awww i wanted to see a Steven universe cartoon
Idk 2 Nickocado Avacado parodies is a little much right?
Somebody please give this man a show
This is a “Never ending story”
So uuuuh….about that will smith video….
Hey man. Don't push yourself.
This is a MASTERPIECE
FUCKING LOVE THIS!!!!!!!
Nice
The angry stretch marks are perfect
🔥👏👏
MEAT CANYON MUKBANG WHEN?
2022 best youtuber
I remember drawing a shit version of Steven Universe when you were smaller and you liked my tweet. It's the only thing I find blessed.  Also this video was gold lmao
I think we all need to be thankful he just spared us of another 3 minutes of sexually uneasy tension between stevens big fat belly and us
do one on barbie
Instead of going to therapy this man turns it into a YouTube video
I unironically would've loved that Will Smith one.
MeatCanyon is so cute. <3
Hell yeah meeety dude
he fell back on odd sexual tension as he was told why he shouldn't use odd sexual tension    classic
Yes, yes I do ship Papameat and the Youtube Algorithm Monster Machine Thing
You’re a hero guy.
"i fall back on that a lot" *immediately falls back on it*
I would have expected this video to have been anything but a promotion for a second channel.
At first, I thought « how is he going to pull this off? » Now this makes sense 😂
daddys meat yaaaaaay
Daddy's here, Daddy's got you.... That's all we want to here 🖤🤣
I hate you sometimes...     ... that is why I will never unsubscribe! Thank You.
PRETTY FUCKING WEAK BRO. I HATE IT
Your running out of ideas? Oh shit does that mean the end of meatcanyon?
We get it, you’re tired, take a break and come back with fresh new ideas dawg.
I love a palpable the artist frustration is here. Epic.
Never ending story wonder if you could make the swamp even darker.
YES QUEEN!
The like to view ratio is good
Like Steven could've been alot worse especially with that gem for a belly button, it's pointy in the back right? So it should've had severe internal bleeding and infected stuff back there.
Every one looks at the demon differently
Flap Jack next??
This meat i consume with a smile on my face
I stinks! Nice and good.
You’ll figure things out Matt take your time and do what you gotta do.
Dude I love your style so much, AMEN 🎉🎉🎉
Lmao omfg this is a good one 😂😂👏
Why does he make everyone look a pedo
Some potent ideas for you to parody  -Scrubs TV show  -The Simpsons  -Justice League  -Fresh Prince of Bel Air (Will Smith)  -The Matrix
I always hated the show
Is meat canyon getting burnt out and he’s just trying to tell us in a humor way?
I….I…I don’t….. thought this was gunna be steven universe not meatcanyon seducing the youtube algorithms
Buddy if you want to take a break it's tottally fine. I was gone for a year and a half. People need breaks.
Could've been worse...                Wish it was D':
Try ruining the neverending story, there's bound to be copious amounts of material that you can work with
Is this just unnus annus?
Do amazing world of gumball
The monster should have had Susan Wojcicki's face
IT took me a minute, but when it said "I've been hurt before" I knew it was Oney.
If Steven Universe is your childhood... you're still a child.
Yooo let’s make a fosters home for imaginary friends !!!!!
Fuck Steave universe
Hey man your ok right not gonna kill yourself right dark truths can be hidden in comedy
This should be a regular thing every so often
He has yet to ruin my childhood
I swear to God this was the funniest video I've seen in weeks. Too hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 i  still feel bad for the pressure they put on you though, not cool
this has to be one of my fave videos of yours
yes.... excellent...  torture the artist 🎨
Take care of yourself man, stress is easy to come, hard to get rid off. Wish you good health man.
I love this. <3
Lol meat canyon you crazy good man
Already Joined last year brother
Damn
So many layers to this video. Art, such art.
*WE DEMAND YOUR SWEET NECTAR*
I can't believe I just saw schlatt with nuts on his face.
Meatcanyon masters of ruining childhood cartoons
Medicated Nikocado Avocado.
Been waiting for a SU parody
why just why
Chris rock bit was hilarious and I love the Never Ending Story Outro. Don't worry, I already am subscribed to the second channel :D
Wait...what kind trouble did Steven sniff out?
this is the next golden age of what we all know as,  meat canyon!!!!!
He should do a ice age canon that would be awsome
😂😂😂
I just want to say that you can take as much time as you want to create content we will be waiting here for videos no matter how frequently you post🤍
this really depicts how hard he works for his audience   thanks papa
Ohhhh you poor bastard
I love this man so much.
Animate more of your mental anguish
We love you meatcanyon. You are an inspiration to us all.
Aww. I wanted him to make fun of something that's cringe
WE LOVE YOU MEATCANYON!!!
"I'M GLAD I HAVE TO DO THIS TO SURVIVE!!!" 🤣
i like youtube voice
I felt something was off, had stopped watching your content since a month or two but I knew your creativity couldn't have declined so much. Good to know it was bait. Quality over quantity bro, don't exhaust yourself.
104k likes in 6 hours that's fucking ridiculous
Ur my goddamn favorite creator lmfao
This video is fucking amazing
😂😂😂😂😂 Enough said!!!
Please don’t put gun in your mouth I love your content
you should really do paw patrol .
Cool bro
3:14 haaaaahahha
YouTube and other platforms, social medias policy on what can or can't be posted or monetised is infinetly worse horror then any of this guys animations.
I love you
I don’t know who Steven universe is, but I feel like the animation was accurate. As well as the YouTube algorithm 😂.
Please do they Crystal gems. I picture them a little more meatty 👁️👄👁️
This feels like an April fools joke
Meatcanyon x YouTube algorithm. Still better love story than twilight
Did anyone else see the anime figure meat canyon bought in the background at the top right at 0:40
This is fucking epic 😂😂😂😂
Amen brother!
Oh man…
The never ending story reference caught me so off guard but I couldn't have been more pleased
meatcanyon, you do not have to *just* make disturbing parody content. i would love to see you reanimate an existing cartoon, for example
how to starve the algorithm?
art in art in art in art what is life
Maybe do the Power Rangers and make a joke about how Lord Zed doesn’t have any skin so it’s very painful for him.
Calling it now first time watching the video he's going pull out the gem out his bellybutton.    Edit: I was absolutely wrong 😂 and I'm glad I'm wrong lol
Send this to Cory
I wanna see the cry baby fans.
I got never ending story vibes at the end there! 😂
You should do purple guy next
I really wanted a steven universe episode T-T
400k views and 102k LIKES? THAT PROVES HOW GOOD CHRIS ROCK'S CHEEKS GOT SLAPPED
Best goddamn channel announcement ever.
I SHALL JOIN YOU SIRE!!!!!
I never knew I could be disgusted by Steven till now 🥲 :’)
You've done it again!
Put you tube on blast
I can't listen to him talk without hearing Katz's voice
So much going on
Broo that chris and will one is epic!!!!!
"Ive been hurt before..." got me lol
Hey meatman idk if you read these but I love your channels, your content, and your humor.  I just wanted to say that while I know your all about the dark and fucked up humor ( that's why I love your stuff) please please if you ever really do feel depressed or down and trapped please get the help you deserve. I know the whole suicide bit was a joke and that's fine, but I know some people hide their pain behind their humor too. I'm sure this was a pointless comment but I just wanna say that you bring so much laughter and joy to people!
YEESSSSSSSSSSSWW,LOVE YOU MY GUY XX
I wonder how spergy the Steven universe fan base will get about that short little clip
Dude, i love how you turned creative burnout and algorithm problems into a good video. 10/10 another fantastic video. Please take care of yourself and your art and i'll see you on your second channel
Based on a true story
Now i feel uncomfortable
YOOO JSHAT LMFAOOOO
I wasn’t going to watch this cause I hate Steven but I’m glad I did.
i wanted to see pearl
I want him to make an adult sim cartoon
A master of self-expression
✨glad I have to do this TO SURVIVE!!✨
Person in Iron lung playing iron lung
I'm so sorry dude :(  I wish you could create freely
Oh this might be the most unique YouTube video on the planet.
Clearance is a god awful cartoon
the best episode of steven universe. I love it
I feel this on so many levels. God speed you magnificent son of a bitch! Of course I’ll follow ya. WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Algorussy hut diff
What the hell lol
its always about his second channel that he can't shut up about but is he doing anything about it no
whose birthday is today? happy b-day.. thx spencer for the lovely video
Love it! Stay blessed man you are so talented.
Thank you so much for the Steven universe, my prayers have been answered
YEES LETS GOOO Falk.. I mean Youtube algorithm takes us there!!!¡¿????
I wonder if this was done in relation to ParashockX's comics
The Steven’s universe thing should become a full episode
I thought meat canyon was taking a break
I want a longer version of the will smith one so cool!
I’m still holding out for an amber heard and Jonny depp video
Fnaf Security Breach Characters
This is literally his best video.
wouldn't it hurt like hell to ride that youtube worm thing?
What every MHA fan looks like.
Dude the never ending story reference was fucking awesome lol. And will smith's voice had me dying lol. I love when you use that voice it's hilarious.
Papa Meat gonna bang that algorithm and I’m completely okay with that!
steven poo verse
Brother, was this a cry for help?
I'm sorry meatcanyon 🥺this one was sad I know you're having a rough time. We support you thank you for all your hard work. Please don't feel any pressure on our behalf we love you! Take your time your fans crave your videos we will love to watch them no matter when you upload! If you need a vacation we can wait 😊
yummy🤤
My question is why are you looking to the algorithm for answers and not the people who subbed to your channel?
Thank you for surviving ♥️
Meat canyon animation is actually high class
Fucking greatness. That’s where you are headed
I think this is the most wholesome animation I’ve seen him make so far
This biggest and best bait and switch of the damn year. I'm already subscribed to the other channel btw. So yeah jokes on you see you next week for the new video.
Scary
never have I seen a better someone plug their second channel as well and creatively as this. You have my sub.
so the youtube algorithm is a Wurmcoil Engine
The self awareness in this video is too fucking real.
I know this was about him being worked rlly hard…but it can’t just be me being disappointed that it WASNT a Steven Universe parody…I’ve wanted one for years😂
between you and James Lee having relationship troubles with your respective app, i dont know whos worse
YESSS!!!!!!!!
At this point meatcanyon can do anything and we be impressed , he’s earned god mode irl
Did you do a 90s power rangers one already? With the Zords all connecting together? I feel there is a lot of potential there. Then you have so many freaky characters, Zed, Zordon, Zack....
Bro the brutal honesty 😂😂
Understandable, have a nice day
Him talking about Steven university and then he makes it an add about his otehr channel
Man... I love ur videos
I will join you
This is the ONE THING I hoped he wouldnt ruin, and he did...
Okay now Youtube-Algorithim-Chan is a thing.
Or do Barney lol and baby bop is the maniac
i fucking cant finish this
Wholesome
I am both worried about this man, and not concerned at all.
Lmfao perfection
Brother I enjoyed every second of this video thank you for making me laugh I really appreciate it thank you again
bruh...lol!
Can you do South Park and Kenny is the demonic  one lol
stevens belly so large from consuming all the PC Gender Fluid, so salty.
1:42 😂😂😂
Steven universe = 🤮
Dude you weren't fat enough.
RIP Cream Crew
You are the worst thing in my life, thank you.
Ahh    This guy is so brutal, and I love it.
You should do a cursed wallace and gromit
He’s gotta do amazing world of gumball
I will die watching Meatcanyon Videos
This escalated quickly.
Just don't drop this one tho please
I fucking love the never ending story music while your riding the YouTube algorithm falcore machine 🤣
1:29 lol
Sweet 🎂
What was that Scooby doo animation :||||
To real
Best click bait ever!
This is honestly how I seen this show as
Upload a caillou one pls
This fucking guy......damn I love Meatcanyon
These are and aren't nice to watch while high
Lmao perfectly funny
Nooooooo!!!!! Not Steven!!!!!😭😭
This is meta as hell and I love it. Also the pokemon drawing videos on the Papa Meat channel are amazing, more people should definitely check it out.
Good thing I hate this show
Meta commentary about meta commentary   We’ve ascended
I hate when the community demands crap out of creators, it ruins the reason why we follow people in the first place. Do whatever you feel needs to be done Meat🤙
I always thought how weird it was how they drew the gem INSIDE the fucking belly button. Some episodes have that thing detailed like crazy
I have really been enjoying the content on the PapaMeat channel
Bout time
I’m waiting for jshlatt to come here and say what the fuck was that?
NO FAM WTF WHYY
MeatCanyon I think you could come up with anything, even if it's not that great, and people would still watch it. However, all of your videos are great.
Yup not even PapaMeat had the balls to make some steven universe content. Goes to show their power.
That’s what YouTube look like
"Why must you hurt me in this way?"
Wish this was out back when tumblr was around still doing goods work
I'm waiting for a catdog one done lmao
You just gotta sweet talk the algorithm
I love how he draws himself. Not only does he make fun of everyone, bit he makes fun of himself and I fond that respectable. Meat, you have my loyalty as a fan
Lol 😆 best one yet
Do a video on jellybean, it is trending and there is a lot of material to do off of
I love you Mr. MeatCanyon man... You make dat good shid... 💩
This is traumatizing
FINALLY YOU DID STEVEN
Best plug I've ever seen
Meat, give me... Give me more flavor give me more flavor of your work, please...
dam that was a trip, that grim nostalgia topped it off well
0:55 Spongebob voice
W Video 😂😂😂
I need among us animation from meatcanyon
take your time making videos bud. No rush. Love from me and to your channel
Tbh in a way this was adorable compared to the other videos
Meatcanyon taught me that friendship is what really matters.
The Oscar shit 😂😂😂😂😂
This is too creative lol
This is without a doubt the best video that he’s done so far.  XD I was laughing so hard throughout the whole video.
3:14 is this a reference to an episode of teen titan, starfire riding stilky 💀
xD OMFG I loved this, the reality it referenced, and the sick and twisted concept of just how dark and f*cked up being an entertainer can be! You're a damn genius MC, I mean ffs who else could put this sort of dark humor into actual perspective so flawlessly?!
Cmon meat canyon not Steven 💀💀🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Maybe you need a podcast, something... creamy.
Never ending story !!!! and  Falkor ???!!!🤩
Wow fascinating.
ono
I hate this, it’s hilarious. Fuck you, take my like and subscription.
no nooooooooooooooooooo
Bungus
Ok, but I would still like to see what happens to Chris Rock's bare bottom, tho.
nooo....
Even a God of animation must do the bidding of the algorithm leviathan. God help us all
That’s his mom in there
This is the greatest ad for a second channel ever lmao
"Yeah?" *Yeah*
This reminds me of their anti-racist ad
So you won't be uploading to this channel anymore
I just can't believe you animated every one of your beard hairs. Subbed.
Bro this is golden. I hope you're having a good day.
I need to see schlatt react to that
*_Lemme drive my manly van into your heart baby.. like a double wide CookieCat suprise_*
Never really cared for that gem bellied freak, I’ll watch it after tho ;3
lol I love it vids
I still won't subscribe your second YouTube tho 💀
This is an excellent monster, such a diva.
PaPaMeat got *you*, baby.
Best 2nd channel promo ever
Steven universe if it was on adult swim (hopefully I spelt that right)
I like how oddly deep this goes, YouTube’s constant pressure is so hard to not crumble under.
I think this is the best advertisement for a second channel i've ever seen
I can’t figure out if I’m glad or disappointed This wasn’t a Steven universe video…
Bitch, I’ve BEEN subscribed
That's not Steven universe That's nikocado avocado lmao
So fucked Youtube is still in the same shitty hole it's been in for years. Hoping for some sort of change SOME day.
i made this cartoon in 2016 but not as pretty
Man this was great
Clifford the big red dog but he is just like Godzilla and he is called Clifford the big bloody dog and every bark he dose it I explodes peoples ear drums and kills them and it also it causes a Earth quake
I can attest to the second chanel and flying being real.
I just woke up and this is the first thing I see. I was plannying on chilling and listening to some nice music but no, I felt a moral obligation to watch this. Only for it to be an ad. But a funny one so it's fine
YouTube algorithm sounds like Veigar from League lol
Well, you don't have to suck-off the algorithm to survive. You could get a job in a factory. Then you could blow your brains out...
PapaMeat is undefeated
Steven Universe was made BY child groomers FOR child groomers.
This has just ruined Steven universe for me I will never look at it the same again
fine I'll subscribe to the other channel, but you best keep making this creepy disturbing shit that i like
Why do you guys all echo the same shit on every single video? "This man ruined my childhood" "My childhood is soooo ruined now" " Thanks Meatcanyon for ruining my childhood" "I don't know what else to say so I'm gonna copy everyone else like a 5 year old hurr durr"  Can you all shut up with that shit and just enoy the video instead of being constantly unoriginal?
Yooo this wasn’t the greatest thing ever
I gotchu my boy
I burst out laughing so hard. This is amazing
Smoke sum bud Works for me
This one is fuckin halarious
absolutely fucking genius
i thought that was a nono plug in the thumbnail
This is what happens when you get an animator's block and you turn it into a tricks ramp...
I talked about a possible steven universe meatcanyon parody last night and this happened lmao love it~
Onward
Amazing video
you are way too good at this shit omg
lol
Oh thank you. I thought I was about to watch 3 minutes of stupid fucking dumbass Steven Universe.
WEBAREBEARS
Another piece of pure art. Please don’t over think papa<3
You should make a video about Putin
That was just purely fucking brilliant! Lmfao
Babe wake up new meatcanyon cartoon!
We only was 15 seconds of steven universe and that was it
Was that a Never Ending Story reference there at the end? If so, very clever.
I want to die
You really know how to be the light in any rainbow MC. I’m impressed.
is nobody gonna talk about how unironically badass that youtube worm looks?
i fucking love your videos no matter how much they make me uncomfortable lmao
cai no bait
You had me at lewd anime statues
steven universe was my favorite show and you made him into a 55 year old man
I have no words
I love the second channel
My childhood never been better after seeing weirdass steven universe -
Ill be honest, I have been looking forward to your second channel uploads more than your main channel. Just watching you be goofy and do quick little things is great. You should stream too, I would watch that (and I don't even watch streamers)
The youtube algorithm monster should’ve been the face stealing spirit from ATLA with the face and of big youtubers
YouTube: It feels like odd sexual tension! MeatCanyon: Yeah I do fall back on that a lot *Proceeds to fall back on it again*
This felt a little too real lol
I will follow you forever. Also Paw Patrol but they are always dying and the dark secret is the tower clones them
"put the gun to my mouth" hope that's not to sinister or anything
Please please lord meatcanyon, do Amber and Johnny Depp court room
Wtf
Was never really a fan of this show but this is horrifying he looks like Michael Jackson if he was fat
The fandom is probably aroused
Hunter: Yaay this is awesone Me high at 1am: OMG  this disturbing
Please, Mr. Canyon don't ever leave us. You are a treasure and  a gem.
Goat
Best...shit...ever 😂
I think MeatCanyon would be a great fit on adult swim.   But he would definitely lose a certain amount of freedom, and he already seems to be chafing under youtube, so I don't know if he'd be for it.  Just hate to see such a talented artist getting more and more frustrated and bitter.  Admittedly, the toons are fantastic. Thank you MeatCanyon.
I immediately subscribed.
Man.. what the fuck, I wanted some disturbing shit like always, but instead I got second channel shilling. I AM ALREADY SUBSCRIBED TO BOTH WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM ME? MY SOUL?
Oh my gosh that was amazing. Had me laughing nearly the whole time
I think this is one of the less sick videos meatcanyon has ever made, seeing the title sincerely I would have expected something creepy but then... It turned in something that I don't know if is only funny or genius.
Make a video describing coffee
Finally meatcanyon lore
Animated meatcanyon is actually okay
all hail the mighty meat
Who is the guy at 0:40?
Man I wanted a Steven universe vid too
WHY I GOTTA DO MY JOB TO MAKE MONEY
Love 💘
This is a perfect representation of YouTube's parasitism.  Good job Hunter
I was scared about this video cuz of Steven Universe which was by far the best show in history but then as I kept watching, all I could do was laugh as the Ball sack dude and mr.canyon riding the YouTube algorithm machine. 🤣🤣🤣 Meatcanyon your bringing a new age of topnotch animation and crazy sick but truthful messages that never stops to amaze me
I want another terrifying Teletubbies video or something like that.
You've earned yourself a fresh glass of milk. Now drink up man.
Falkor at the end🤣🤣
We love you Papa, Thank you for all the content, no matter when it comes out! FOR THE SUN!!!
Just found out:  YouTube is what's gonna take over the world, I remember a time when anyone could just upload a funny video... Just for fun..
youtube algorithm monster sounding like Conan O'Brien's old timey commentator voice
Gold 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
I love comments from people who haven't actually watched the video, they just want to be high up in the responses.
this was unironically beautiful i love it
You got this my dude. I love both channels so much. 😤
Seeing you in your art style, still looks like ya
How in the fuck does he make ads terrifying yet sexual
Lmao
I'm glad you left that laugh in at the end.
Meatcanyon should draw the Simpsons as mutants like the ones from the hills have eyes
I wonder if you could do a Tom and Jerry vid
PLEASE do an animation about Amber Heard and Johnny Depp's lawsuit 😂
This video will get demonitized
Why did Meatcayon didn't do anything weird to pilot Steven
Oh no. Don’t ruin the show… :(
Lol
Awesome video
Every other video has turned into Meatcanyon stressing about what he does for a living. Maybe if Monster House didn't reek of far-left political nonsense, it would have been more popular.
thank you dear creator
You can do Chuck E. Cheese ?
I suggest the rhythm horror game THUMPER and the platformer JUBILEE and the cutest gore game PURFECT APAWCALYPSE, also what you did to Chester Cheeto, also this 4th wall break
You've outdone yourself with Eldritch horror this time, that goblin working on the computer is something else!
Steven before the last movie is like 11, why does he look like his dad.
You've made looking behind the curtain an artform 🤣
Omg you didn't pierce your nutsack riding the algorithm?
One of the funniest damn things I've ever saw in my life!
Man I kinda wish he did a full Steven Universe video lol
suggestion: talking pizza that kills your family
That jschlatt idea would actually work
please don't do my little pony next haha ahaha nooo
This guy is consistently hilarious. Dude is dripping with talent.
Супер
God bless you Hunter for making this Inside Baseball toon to spite the horrible algorithm monster. We'll be with ya wherever you go, Papa Meat.
Day 1 of asking for smurf gangbang!
Chick-fil-A but it’s actually not chicken but mutilated cows
This man is king meat
incredible never ending story reference here 3:07 !!!!!
another banger
man drew himself very well
The second channel is actually pretty awesome
I love this guy.
= ;
This is taking it too far meatcanyon.
Ohhh that was just brilliant, I just thoroughly enjoyed the brutal transparency basically haha
Twisted Neverending Story reference, but the YouTube monster algorithm is ever creator’s nightmare. (Shudder)
Wait a min. Is that Matt Watson 2:33
Steven is like a left 4 dead boomer
Significantly better than steven universe
YouTube algorithm monster reminds me of the face stealer from Legend of Aang
The true form of the youtube algorithm is very accurate. You are the best animation channel papa meat.
Donald Trump's voice   And please do that voice  Not anymore
Ok but the Will Smith bit made me howl
I just came to comment that I refuse to watch this
Clickbait, I wanted a Steven Universe video
What the fuck was that 😂
Meta as fuck
Clash of clans horror pls
We love you Father Flesh now and forever <3
Meatcanyon should draw trump as a cyborg
I respect a man's dedication to horrify me
What a twist, I was not expecting that lol
Meatcanyon needs to make a video titled cyborg trump vs Chinese president winnie the poo
I’m getting little Britain vibes idk why
Never stop uploading
I fucking love meat canyon keep up the good shit
lol
Jschlatts balls are so big! Pogchamp!
We need an elden lord to run this country
I believe this is Stephen Universes
We love you meat canyon! Don’t feel obligated to create stuff at such a fast pace! We love you no matter what you put out! You are an awesome content creator!❤️🤘🏽
PLEASE MAKE SOME FUCKED TWISTED SHIT OUT IF MORPHEL.
You've got my sword. 🗡️
Is Meatcanyon just irl Steven universe?
I wish i could put my eerily calming thoughts to the digital domain as you do sir...the twisted membrane of youtube craves more !!! Do you ever do tutorials on how you make your ever tasteful brain food? Please give us the tantalizing secrets...i crave the dark powers that lurk in your mind.
Really smart video. I hope PapaMeat blows up!
another childhood show ruined by his grace
I seen people with no sub's post a video about Chris rock and will that got 5 mill views
My god how does he somehow make it worse
This is the best video you have ever made
O God is meatcanyon getting harassed by the YouTube overlords ??
For the algorithm Gods
Lmao it was the neverending story reference for me
This is probably your best video I love it
Daddy
Love your work. Check out my lil' contribution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUsZk23V1Gk
Papameat should (maybe)(if he wants) animate some GOOSEBUMPS inspired cartoons. I think something like "the haunted mask" in meat canyon style and humor could be very entertaining.  (Yeah i saw the Goosebumps tier list)
Based Steven
“Anything is possible though friendship.” and love 😩🤌🏻
If the youtube algorithm monster machine theme had it's own theme song it'd be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UtURionlvU
I think you just made Steven Universe better.
I feel violated ... But for once ... I accept it and the twisted thing is I think I like it.
I would love for you to do something with Invader Zim
Why does animated meat canyon look like an older Bobby Hill?
Brandy and Mr whiskers
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS DAY TO COME LMFAOOO
I was already subscribed to PapaMeat, but this is the best second channel announcement I've ever seen. Also,  I AM A MILLIPEDE I AM PERFECTION
I agree with you at the start. SU is one of the worst and most boring things ever.
It’s the fact that I just started this show and you make this
Nothing is safe from Papa Meat. Not even YouTube itself
Great Vid Meatboi
does mr youtube alogyrthm voice veigar in league o-o
I can't stop laughing 😆 🤣 😂
I always thought that steven universe was a real cringe progre sh*t. This one portrays it very well.
If you run out of Ideas please re-do Oney Cartoonz "Wingardium Leviosa" xD
The second channel makes me so happy
I died at the end. Thank you
I loved this.  Maybe if you do have trouble coming up with  Ideas. You can roll with this and animate you trying to come up with ideas
Be honest. Is this a cry for help
Ü
You should do a power rangers one
This is single-handedly the best YouTube video ever seen in about two years, and I know for a fact I’ve been just a shit ton of YouTube man
What about the toilet paper charmen bears for a video?
I always get so freaking excited to see these videos😂 they make my day!
I love how you drew the YouTube algorithm!
Thus is officially one of my top favorite YouTube videos. Fucking hilarious 🤣
shameful advert for the second channel. got be fair it is a great second channel.
… For once in my life I’m fine that Meat Canyon made horror of something
Do meatcayon ninjago
Steven universe vs Vin Diesel  Friendship vs family
Hahahahahahahahahaha you good sir have bought yourself all the time you need
Perfect
....You're totally fucking that algorithm, aren't you MC?
LOVE U MEATCANYON!!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
DID YOU JUST FUCKING CLICKBAIT ME 😭
Ughh i love you
Absolutely lost it at the Will Smithy joke 🤣🤣😂😂
I really love the range of voices you can do
I love how the YouTube algorithm monster sounds like a Dalek 😂😂😂 I also love seeing your work process 😂😂😂
Why
THIS IS FUCKING GREAT
I sacred
I kind of want to see the steven universe big belly video still
You really shouldn’t be so hard on yourself. We don’t mind waiting for content, don’t wanna get burned out.
Papameat GOATED
Oh ok?!!?.
steven universe unexpected
🤣😅😅😅😅
You should do one we’re bambie mom gets fing ran over and bambie watches it
God bless this man
D-da-da-daddy
I love u man 😂
I love your vids but I always think, the horror is based off parodies of popular brands and culture, I wonder how original character and monsters would look like. Then I thought, maybe that's the genius. Like a demented Andy Warhol, it's a reflection of the consumer society we live in, taken to surreal terrifying extremes
“I’m going to make your ass as bare as her head.” That one had me dying 🤣
I fucking love you man take your time on shit
Papa Meat and the YouTube Algorithm, an enemies to lovers story. You never cease to create works of art Mr. Meat.
I need a complete video of Chris Rock and Will Smith lmao.
Finally I knew this day would come but not as soon as I thought
Amazing
bro wtf is happening
I was fully expecting a weird psychosexual relationship with Steven's mother being in his belly, or a trans/non-binary allegory with his mother BEING him lol. Or like a Jesus comparison or something.
Well shit that escalated, then that shit escalated the escalation.
Bro…
It's truly amazing how far you have come , im glad i was in this journey to see it
Make a mgs (metal gear solid) one
Your not so subtle cries for help are answered by our laughs.. and likes
That youtube centipede monster was so well animated and satisfying
Remember all the other animators that got demonetized and fucked by the algorithm? How is meatcanyon, the most morbid of them all, our final champion left standing by the demonetization police? I love it, but seriously he is the most unlikely final champion.
Why does Steven look like he’s gonna invite me to his house for Stromboli
Dude always a Genius xD
3:09 me 40 hours a week M-F
God fuckin sake’s man of course I’ll join ya
I'm with you Papa.<3 You do great work that I'm always looking forward to. And, for the evil that bitch Susan has caused, your second channel is like the big fat pieces of cake and your animations are the cherries on top. I genuinely enjoy listening to your thought processes behind what you have made and watching you find inspiration in-between pairs of tig ol' anime bitties.
This was awesome
Meats interpretation of him self awesome 😂
This video is masterfully done!!
Lolol hajahajajaj funny man :,) hah lulz :,,)
no steven universe eldritch horror video with odd sexual tension?  what have you become?
💋🤌🏼 parrfektshun
Loved the video, but we were never here for short dumb videos that aren't good. We are here for your talent of making our childhood nightmares come true. Even if it means we gotta wait
meat canyon didnt know your screams where in a song lol If you listen at 0:47 on the song soak me in bleach by the amitty affliction, you can hear meat canyons legendary scream
Just the thumbnail is Gold
YES SIRRRRR
He ate too much cookie cats
Reminds me of what hotdiggedydemon is doing with Brain dump to work through his troubles while still making great content. It's nice to see honestly, I hope it helps to stave off the dreaded wall of burnout that plagues this type of work.
This is the best advertisement ever, if he asked for 60 dollars like this I’d give him it
Do elmo wants a hug
"That is cause for de-monitization The way you did the voice and the pacing causes for odd seggsual tension" Meat: : "yeah I do fall back on that allot" 😂😂 always look forward to your content like some weekly manga chapters
Now you ruined Steve univers to me...
You deserve all the fame in the world 😭
The fucking stretch marks
Okay now you've gone too far.
straight clickbait lol
How about something with Lego ninjago
flying is nice but doesn't it hurt to sit on the alograthim like that?
Epic
“Oooh yeeah”
I relate to trying to be loose with it lmao
2:10 giving me mad Gremblo vibes lol
Best
Meatcanyon, please do an Adolf Hitler animation, it would be fantastic if you would, please 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Damn that true
Poggers
So meta I love it
Yeeeeeessssss bring it on MeatCanyon
Steven  smoking something
He did it, my god he did it. Is that math Watson? Tiffany Watsons brother???!!
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME!!!!
I can see it now. R34: Youtube Algorithm
Fuck MeatCanyon
And Gondor will answer: subscribed.
Yes, the blind idiot god The Algorithm must be lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demonic second channel.
My favorite one hands down.
When the neckbeard became king!
Gravity falls 💀
Any of y’all remember the snake monster in the movie 9?
Oh no that sound design
I come back from lunch just to see this come up. Day ruined
I don't know what the fuck you're worried about. My ass is in tears I'm laughing so hard. 😭
No please.. this was a sacred one MeatCanyon.. Why..??
Was that Chris?
amazing
this is why meatcanyon is loved by everyone
GLORIOUS
Ayooooo
YouTube recommend this to me. So I guess what you said made the algorithm happy. XD
my childhood my eyes my everything hurts…….
“Takes hand” “proceeds to cut ball sac open on YouTube algorithm” 😂😂
The channel as been up for a while, and it’s great, join us and come say hi to papa
i want to shater myself now
It hasn’t even started abs I just know I’m gonna be sick  Nvm this man taught me how to communicate with my significant other 2:14
I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this
let me do voices for your cartoons no charge 😘😘
(comment to feed the algorithm)
Youtube kinda sounds like starscream 😂
SRY TO BE LIKE THIS but Mukbang King should return with Orlin 😂
My soul is already pledged to you, both of your channels are my eyes, my sweet chunky nightmarish papa God🤣
yo meat daddy didn’t they make a cup head show?
Do backuardagins
The best advertisement of a channel I’ve ever seen
this is the best ad for a second channel. good shit!
Jesus fuckin Christ what HELL Just happened.  I thought I'd be watching a Normal meet canon????? well as normal as Meat canon Gets.  But no this video took a complete 180 It was a big Advertisement regardless I still love it Inside humor instead of the normal you know Stuff.
probably your best video ever
Every one of papa meats videos have some sort of weird plot twist that you never expect
“I’ve been hurt before. *moans*” fuckin hilarious
GL.
Might as well go ahead and come on over to Papa’s second channel. It’s better than nothing, I guess.
Omg bro
Papa meat plugged himself in the video
I'm already in.
To be honest, I like the papa meat channel better than this one.
I love you meatcanyon, I always will. I've never had a real innocent childhood, and I would love to make it even more twisted. ♥️
personally, i dont care if you upload once every 5 months. its always a joy to see your videos, no matter how frequently they come out. doing what you do is hard work. but you're doing great!
DUDE THE NEVER ENDING STORY NOD AT THE END. MEAT MY BOI GIVE US A NEVERENDING STORY ONE ! Make artexes death more tragic or some shit
lol
I'd love to be part of your fever dreams
you should do a genshin impact parody lol
now i’m curious as to what the other gems would look like in his style
I would pay money to see Rebecca Sugar reaction to this video
Omg not Steven. He witness perfection
When he's riding the YouTube algorithm monster robot thing, he's literally sitting on one of the spikes. Ouch.
Lol this is my new favorite video.
Criticalz parody, but it's hyper satirical with shit and garbage trucks and that stuff he's hyped up in the past, and he banishes you to become another hair cell stop his head, ever increasing the length of his hair with you as a piece
The best way ive seen shameless shilling
Nice
Crazy idea a meatcaynon show. Do it
Next up is Phineas and Ferb :(
Bro this was freaken beautiful put your self in more animations!
As the guy who did the interactive belly for the Steven Universe launch, I salute you.
sexualizing the YouTube algorithm, bold move.
Hilarious video man felt like you came back to your roots with this one a little, not a major fan of the second channel but this video helps explain why you have it so ill keep watching regardless❤️
The sincere laugh at the end got me 😆 🤣 😂
._,
Oh God....
This is your best video yet
Lmaaoooo this is the best ad of all time!!!
Hell ya this was fucking great.
Low key disappointed there wasn’t more SU, but still loved the video lol
Too accurate lmao
The will smith and Chris rock killed me
"im about to make your ass as bare as her head"  im fucking rolling
What a beautiful, magical story. Filled with challenges and laughs. Thank you Papa Meat
It only gets one video to get the tears flowin', I'll tell you that.👌
2:38 wtf is goin on🤣🤣🤣
"Poop for me." --the YoutubeFiend
An adventure that smells of Cheetos and childhood. I like it.
META
I would like to see a ren and stimpy animation, but then again that show is already a trip by itself, so making it even more cursed would be a challenge, but still.
This video feels like a trip
Weeeeeeeeeeee the air up here is so beautyfull
Alec Baldwin is a murderer and Epstein didn’t kill himself… Just sayin
I want to see the Will Smith Sketch
Just fuckn plug the channel 😂😭 i know its bouta be stoopid just send me a shirt cuz im wit it
What if you make one of the backardiagins
Is nothing sacred?
Thank you tarnish
Do you ever just think, let me not animate this?
Told ya you never should have have taken the money, bro. Told you your writing would suffer for it. Told you that it dries up all creativity. But did you listen to me? Did you listen to ME!? I'm only sorry I couldn't talk you out of it at the time. I've failed you.
How naïve of you Meat Canyon... to assume that I don't follow you on your other account already!
Your a pretty funny bloke, ever thought about doing a podcast with a couple autistic animators
this felt suicidal, meat, I know how it feels
The creativity in this is amazing
Steven Universe was a disgusting series.
Today I learned that drinking or comsuming anything while watching Meat's videos is a bad idea...
it's pretty clear at this point. Hunter resents the MeatCanyon channel and the pressure it represents and the constant feeling like he has to out-do himself every video. and he loves the stress-free whimsical freedom of his second channel and wants it to be just as big. oh and he definitely hated the podcast lol.
It’s beautiful I love it  “I’m glad I have to do this to SURVIIIVE” just mm delicious
Fosters home for imiginary friends, grim adventures of Billy and Mandy, code name kids next door, South Park
Hahaha! It's so hilariously and palpably on the nose that it hurts
Love your videos keep doing what your doing bro 👍
I completely laughed my ass off. (worth typing it out)
Genius
reminds me of when rick and morty wanted to tell the viewers that it’s not just a lore show and a episodic show
If every Porkchop was Perfect, we wouldn't have SJWs.
Is...is that...veigar?
LOL Meatcanyon funny guy. Hope he's not serious about the gun.
It would’ve been great if YouTube had an eye for the white triangle
You ok man?
YaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaY i love you man, just did you good on your second channel :)
DO LIVER KING NEXT!
I loved watching Steven universe child but now I’m traumatised
I'm surprised that you didn't go with Rebecca Surgar being a pedophile, you know because of all the child porn she drew before she got on to CN and made Steven Universe.
Instant sub to the second channel 🤣 best ad I have ever seen
Man I can imagine gross and hilarious Ren and Stimpy done in meats style. I'm already subbed to second channel but this would make me sub again if I could. Big fan of your work.
Rule 34 of the algorithm monster, please, I need it!
The best add ever made
...
I feel like the jschlatt nutsack idea was great
Was that really the Big Guy?!?!  NutSchlagg is the best Schlatt alt ever!
Huh. Did you get Jshlatt to voice here? And what happened to the other animators? Are they gone?
Entertaining I love it
What the hell is a jay schlut tearless video?
What a meta video journey
Schlatt with balls on his face is the most funny yet cursed this I’ve seen in an animation
Finally. A 4th wall break
If Meatcanyon needs more ideas maybe he could ask the community.
Ethan's voice
Literally turning poison into medicine, using his frustrations and his center of stress as content. A True Artist
Gawd damn
I couldnt sleep for like 3 days because of the magic school bus video. Still haunts me to this day tbh
never ending story refrence...nice
Too meta. The 4th wall has been shattered to pieces, as has my waning sanity
So meatcanyon is screwing the algorithm?
tf
W
this is weird asf
r u my dad
Never thought I would see daddy meat molest the YouTube algorithm
He had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
Seeing MeatCanyon Seduce Youtube is funny as hell XD
Please take a break man. I don't like it when. YouTubers feel this way. And I hate how people can't just wait and realize that animation is a lot of work. Especially from one person. YouTube is the biggest problem for sure but don't be afraid of letting people down, you don't owe anything to us.
Hunter you're amazing!
The side burn nutsacks are gold
I wish i had the money you needed, but you have to starve to be creative my friend. It's true for every artist, once they get their millions they become stale
OMG WE NEED EM TO DO PAW PATROL THAT WOULD  ME AMAZING frbnv,bhuwcf
You have ruined my childhood worst than my dad
I like that Neverending story reference should do a cursed Neverending story animation
WHERE STEVEN UNIVERSE BIG BELLY
🤣🤣🤣👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿😂👍🏿
I wonder how the toxic Steven Universe fandom is taking this video? I wouldn't know. I don't use Twitter or Tumblr.
This is so fucking meta and self aware 😂  *I love it*
Uhhhhh.....Jennifer Love Hewitt ...eats babies...to keep her from turning into an eldritch horror.
It's so stupid In the best way
He had me on the first half not gonna lie
Oh sweet lordy, 1st one almost had my favorite cartoon ruined, 2nd had me laughing, and 3rd had me 😳MMM 🤣LMAO
Less disturbing than the actual cartoon.
This is great lol
J hope that the Learning with PiBbY virus takes over this world
Why’d we wait a month for this
Jokes on you, I was already subscribed.
Looking at this video, I think PapaMeat is having money problems...
"And give me the stability i need to not put a gun in my mouth"  -Meatcanyon
This is the best second channem announcement I've ever seen and that has actually made me subscribe to said second channel. Props to you mama
i love you man and i followed your both youtube channels
This is good
Lol
Best YouTube click bait EVVER!
Mghh
This is what Steven would’ve wanted. A world where papa meat and the YouTube algorithm coexist in order to guarantee survival.
Le monde incroyable de Gumball
When you realize where the spike on the youtube monster is... 3:10
“And give me the stability to not put a gun in my mouth”…  Never heard something more relatable than this
This is absolutely gold  very unexpected lol
This just feels like a Flashgits video, which is not a bad thing
YouTube algorithm just needed some love ... It's been through a lot being the slave of the board of directors 😭💀
As a Steven Universe fan I feel cheated LMAO
yes, i will take your hand, adventure awaits
You still haven’t made a video of Flapjack or Camp Lazlo. Those are 2 ideas.
N O
Oh god this animator character just might be your most grotesque and hideous creation yet! Another great video!
Yaaaaay this was awsooooome I’m glaaaad I wattccchhhed this I feeel so Aaaaalllllivee
Can confirm second channel is the sweet nectar you need. Support the papa of the meats
Was stoked to see a new cartoon on this channel. Keep it up. Screw the algorithm what you do is gold you are the best animator on YouTube
Yes that’s what I definitely expected out of meatcanyon
How the fuck did a video about not being able to think of content for videos turn out to be some of the funniest shit I've ever seen?  Papa Meat is amazing.
I'm almost disapointed that he doesn't draw himself as some kind of mind bending monster of a person
Hi I’m dontai
More like smelly belly ami right guys HAHAHAHA
Nice plug
I fear for the moment Schaltt sees this
That depiction of the Youtube algorithm seems pretty accurate
Im going to the channel now...........and soon..........hope to find out where you live..........
The lighting you pull off is fucking incredible
Well now I need to see you raw dogging the mecha serpent youtube.
*has starch masks*
Wow
3:10 as a fellow animator I can tell *the laugh at the end* was pure unbridled pain, not a humorous laugh the “yay I get to keep doing this to survive so I don’t have to put a gun in mouth”  nothing but sarcasm..
I swear meat canyon could turn anything into a sick and twisted horror video.
MeatCanyon really being honest with us
No one is safe from Meatcanyon
Genuinely I fucking stellar video, its a shame we didn't get to see the crystal gems in your style though :))
YES. FOURTH WALL BREAKING.
Hahaha spot on as always!
already suscribed, love your videos
Whew crisis averted 😂😂
D tier meatcanyon video. The algorithm is displeased.
MetaMeat
Steven universe but he puts crystals in his belly and devour those crystals from those poor souls
Holy shit, this looks official af
Hold up...       THAT was inappropriate?!
WHO DID YOU MODEL STEVEN'S FACE AFTER!? ITS SO FAMILIAR
Ok you’ve crossed the line you can mess with regular show but Steven universe hell no stop it
I think this cartoon was teased a bit in the chester cheeto cartoon cause the guy was animated like a Steven universe character
We appreciate the hard work you do!
Welp Meatcanyon has officially destroyed my childhood Congrats Meatcanyon amazing animation as always!
I know it's funny and all but this is a small dive into what Papa Meat deals with on a daily. Let's all cut this king some slack and just enjoy him on his 2nd channel
U should do courage the cowardly dog fasho
at first i was disapointed to not have a steven meatcanyon cartoon and then i realised your video was actually the most steven universe thing to do, you nailed good job papa meat
Thank you Father Flesh
I feel like making something with fnaf in it would definitely be top tier
Ah yes. The meta video. Sweet nectar.
0:38
Amazing, I don't have words.
This was amazing
Can't help to think that a spike in the ass was what's keeping you on the monster
I fucking love papashmeat 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You had me at lewd anime statues you damn degenerate. I will follow.
Hurray huuray for papa meat
TO SURVIVVVVEEE
No
Bro, this was the best channel plug ever. I thought I was getting used to your art style, but this one made me feel so awkward in the beginning
Lol I love your take on youtube. Godam gold
I don't know how to feel about this but it's fucking hilarious
I love you
Out of all the videos I’ve seen this was the only one I said “wtf is going on” 😂😂
My life dosn't make sense anymore.
Don't like this. Just make fucking short cartoons like you used to. If you can't think of ideas then let fans request. The other channel is boring bro
Fuck I love you
The algorithm saying “I’ve been hurt before” after the mention of a second channel is an amazing dig at all the shitty second channels big you tubers have dropped over the years 😂
This animation is better than the show’s.
You should make a coryxkenshin one
I did it, I clicked and subbed to the other channel, are you happy now?
As a big Steven universe fan I can say this is 100% accurate
Awesome
Take your time and enjoy what u do. We will keep tuned in. Your awesome 👍🏽
Hunter animated looks niceeeeeeee
if youtube strikes this down its officially cannon
Not even a second and everything is not what It seems
WTF
Sweet mercy papa meat you never fail me but seriously where is that Steven universe one
No, Meat Canyon, you can't make me watch you ruin the most precious cartoon to my heart. This is a line too far.
You should do a Chris Chan video
Aw shit
Why was the YouTube algorithm kinda sexy tho?
Watched 1 vid now I’m addicted
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BIG BELLY UNIVERSE ISN'T A GOOD IDEA FIGHT ME IRL
3:10 funny and depressing
what a birthday present.
wtf, youtube caring for animators? i did not think i see the day this gonna happen XD
YEEESSSS
Almost as creepy as the fanbase
Another great MC video
your eyes are wider that that
Lol
Not gonna lie, I was really hoping for some fucked up Steven Universe content, cuz my girlfriend's a huge fan of the series, and I need more things to disturb her with, lol. Love the Youtube algorithm analogy here though.
Ngl the youtube robot is cool...
Lmao this video xD
“I heard what you said about my wife”- Will Smith
Meatcanyon the one place I can find a wtf video no matter what
We dislike jada over here
Canyon's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy.
I love you man... You're a goddamn savage. 🤣
Great, can't wait for it to close down after 100* episodes.    *69 episodes.
But also sad
This was funny
looks like a future boomer from L4D2
Honestly, I dig the Will Smith spanking Chris Rock's ass instead of smacking him in the face.
damn man, lol
Wow it's like a representation of our constant demands for new content and how we unconsciously enslave those content creators to a loop of hunger for new better ideas...mind blown
That was magical
The only commercial for Papa Meat possible
this was just awesome xD
He needs to finish the will Smith one, I NEED TO SEE IT!  PS. I love both his channels, in one we get scarred and in the other we get to know MeatCanyon better and he's super funny.
What just happened
I'm so proud of you. I don't have a son, so I am claiming you as my adopted son. Good job, good job.
ONE OF US
"Daddy did you wrong" NOT THE YEAHHH... 😂😂😂😂
I hated this show Thank you
Was not expecting that XD
This had me laughing the whole way through
You can't fucking do this to Steven universe
When an animator animates himself animating
That ending one of the funniest thing you've ever made easily.
A M O G U S
Yussss
Yes
i don’t understand why people are talking about meat ruining people’s childhood when steven was only featured for like 10 seconds without doing something fucked up like cutting off someone’s head. all he did was look real lol
Lmao 🤣 👀
Do more shit with yourself as the lead yo! this was great :D
What on gods heavily polluted browning earth, the factory must grow.
If you made your own animated compilation like asdfmovie but with all your demented ideas kinda like what you did here I think that would be great
Thank you for not actually doing a SU video
Well this was actually good
God dammit meat, how do you manage to do it every time?
New vidoe
I always imagined youtubes physical body would be the world's most dangerous set of anal beads!
it's totally ok that you dont always have ideas, it's easy for me to forget genius takes time. papa meat is such a good channel too and im glad you enjoy making content on it and it still makes you money. also, i swear to god if someone makes youtube algorithm r34 because of this video...
The algorithm monster is kinda cute
This is exactly how I see YouTube as a physical being
Y'all in the comments better be going over there and subbing!! 😤😤
Are those ninja stars on YouTube A(can’t even spell it)
The chuckle at the end got me.
Dude just take a break the algorithm my get you more views. By spreading it but your fans are the ones that come back to keep watching so take a break
I love your second channel but is there gonna be gonna be a second season of monster lab?
Daddy meat is so meaty rn.
Why
Yes Daddy.
What a masterpiece
PAPA MEAT!!! I need mor videos for my chronic meatcanyon addiction NOW!!!!
Meatcanyon you guys are funny
make a vid about ganglionic smores
NOT STEVEN UNIVERSE WHY :(
Meat canyon is the best at making me uncomfortable
do it for the algo
Damn that chuckle sandwhich episode mustve really inspired him to do this one 😂😂
That twist plug for the second channel was genius!
I hate Steven universe so much I wanted to destroy the world every time I see it. Also a gun in the mouth is messy it's much easier just inhale some nitrogen and just hold it for less than a minute.
have never even heard of Steven universe before. had to look it up
I don't know how people find these videos disturbing, they're hilarious af.
I was looking forward to the Steven Universe parody but I'm not disappointed.
Amazing
we love you mannnn
Im glad the spiky demon algorithm becomes Falcor in the end seems like an allegory for the endless torture and inconsistentness it’s the never ending story for better or worse
Hey meat, got this crazy idea this kid and his family are eating dinner, kid says. mom, this water tastes funny. She remarks, well son,w hy dony uog to fone the water factory and tell them that he goes upstairs to his bedroom, he picks up the phone, and dials the number to 'the water facotry'. they answer, 'the water factory, your global genesys for water. how can i help you' the boy goes, yeah, uh, the water tastes funky the agent on the phone takes a long pause well sir, we understand that may be happening, but all of our water ispromisd fresh. we get it right from 'our source'. no tampering involvde. if something tasets funny, tis the container youre putting it in. none of our water is, or ever will, taste funky the kid looks annoyed and goes, 'look man, im not lying, it tastes funky! okay?" the agent answers "why donty ou come takea  tour at our factory, though, i have to pick you up from your house, tis a rather serious and discrete hiddne location that, only the president of the united states and other presidents of other countries konws the kid is picked up by the agent dressed extremely business and two other bodyguards. they blindfold him and bring him to the facility. what he sees is shocking as he takes a tour. hundreds of hanging suspended vats of the veiling with alien like protrusions. water is coming from tubules gathering from what looks to be their genitals.
Pretty great romance story ngl
I smell some FlashGitz influence in this one....mmmmmm.... sweet, sweet, fragrant smell of  FlashGitz and PapaMeat....
MeatCanyon won't be satisfied until every generational childhood is ruined. I salute you Sir.
Wow. A vid about not having ideas that the algorithm will push ended up being one of your best vids IMO. This was awesome.
Maybe do how to train your dragon?
Thank you mi lord 😭😭😭😭 I’ve been waiting for this for so long 😭😭😭😭  Edit: I am now sad because I thought it was an entire Steven universe video 🥲
Did not expect this but I love it 😂😂
I was wondering when you'd make something Steven Universe related, even if it was like 10 seconds.
Funny af
i already have joined you <3
Joining now!!
I know the cartoons on the main channel are stressful for MC to make, but i really hope this was as cathartic for him as it seemed
I have no words for how much i admire you and your work. You keep on evolvong and really make today’s youtube a better place. Thank you for the laughs
ADS ARE GETTING SMARTER
Nooooooooooooooo
loved the never ending story ending lmao . what a great vid
you sound like kung fu panda
I'm on my way to Papa meat right now
a longer jschlatt video would be good
Does having a 2nd channel help with this problem at all, usually people who start a 2nd channel completely abandon their first one, why not just upload the non-cartoon and side stuff on the main channel? Honestly just a genuine question here.
🤣😂😭
Nooooooo
The will smith part was funny
Whatdda doing Steven
I also need that kind of stability...😢
Do something about PNGtubers maybe?
*"I was actually hoping for a Steven Universe animation, but this will suffice"*  -Critical-RAGE
Beautiful 😢
I love you, Papa Meat.
This dude could also do something with the owl house
NOOOOO NOT STEVEN UNIVERSE, I LOVE STEVEN UNIVERSE 🤣😥😱

Best promo for a second chanel I've ever seen
Wish we could see a FULL animated toon with Will Smith and Chris Rock.
Appreciated.
Please do a Foodie Beauty Canyon
like how he jokes about struggling :)
3:10 Where is this reference from. I keep seeing it in lots of TV shows
I love you papameat
The never ending story reference caught me off guard
????????????
average steven universe fan viewer
I don’t know what to say about this video… I’m flabbergasted
Jesus Christ when you brought up bringing a gun to your own mouth!
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Animated MeatCanyon is a national treasure
It's just a big ol' sarcasm sammich, and we all gotta take a bite.
I'm just wondering if there is any way the next animation you do is one of never ending story.
You should do coryxkension
lmao stretch marks ahh I have those that voice sugoi spikey boi
Weird that MeatCanyon just uploaded a clip of Steven Universe in the beginning…
Here's an animation for you. Draw Artix (Adam) micromanaging Ash.  From an indie game company called Artix Entertainment
Bruh we’re sorry how we’ve made ya get writers block
The fans. They are coming.
Netflix gotta hire this dude
oh

You’re second channel is arguably the best “secondary channel” anyone on the platform uploads to.
Accurate representation of the yourube algorithm.
Oh no… my favorite cartoon plus meatcanyon….
Each of those ideas would have even been great mini episodes on their own. Good job, really enjoying that second channel!
Time is 1:12am can i sleep!
Do one about back at the barnyard
meat canyon just successfully pissed off the thousands of Twitter trans activists with less than 10 seconds of Steven universe
smh
Dude, that Will Smith bit would be hilarious!
Couldn’t you have given it literal giant spider legs so it just crawls across the ground
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you men xd
Oh god.. Steven.. 😭
I just love that MeatCanyon animated himself and showing us how much we love this guy's content and videos he works so hard on, for us to be entertained and terrified.
You sir are a genius
This is TOO META
You're a genius
Love you bro
This is just a video to explain to our weird psychopathic minds a reason why the videos take a long time to upload
This is the best ad I’ve ever seen
This shit is too good.
An absolute masterpiece
For a sec he sounded like appngebob when voicing the youtube centipede especially himself at the end but man this was one funny video and yes I will join your adventure meatcanyon LETS FLYYYY!!!
If perfection was a video…
Funny. More!
Make a new pokemon region
Every single one of these comments is pointing out / praising the basic conceit of your channel (pop culture characters drawn in a certain style) and it's really weird in the context of this video in particular, wherein you yourself acknowledge the repetition of it all.
Underrated
The way he even portrayed himself😭
Meatcanyon is beyond disturbing  …and I love it
Why do all of his videos feel like sick dreams. And why do I love them so much
Rebecca Suger would be surprised lol      Wait I wonder if she would react to this-
Fuck you are a genius! Fuuuuuuck, a genius I say.
Meat, take your time with these videos man, don't burn yourself out😘 I sense you feeling the pressure
Meta af (and not in the Facebook way)
My childhood is fully ruined at this point😭
I stopped watching the new YMS lion king review to watch this.  And I'm glad I did lol
this is unironically the best video you’ve put on this channel
is so cool xD
YouTube being pretty hypocritical. I mean like, the sexual tension between MeatCanyon and YouTube was pretty obvious. We can let it slide though😉 Also I loved the Never Ending Story reference. Haven’t seen that movie in forever.
best promo every
Anyone else actually hoping to see a full MeatCanyon steven universe animation?
I love that schlatt actually did the voice for himself
Lol
I genuinely enjoyed every single frame of this cartoon man, just… bravo 👏
I feel liek this has a deeper meaning
I laughed, I cried, I stood and cheered, I was already subscribed to both channels.
I love this I’m here for it I’m here for papa meat
Thank you for this meat, to everyone here this is seriously what it’s like to upload to YouTube. Appeasing the algorithm is an insane task especially for animators that want to make quality.
Thank you for ruining every show I watched when I was younger 🙏🏼🙏🏼
that neverending story reference killed me. That was way to good.
To survival!
Tom and Jerry horrify them
Very nice video! I hope You can make tings You love Σ:3
lol the schlatt part
Beb
4th channel parody with Cody channel?
I SURE WILL!
Meatcanyon, if you need time to yourself it's all good. Even if you wanna produce different content, we'll be here.
Ive been waiting for this...
I wish I had the artistic prowess to draw Papa meat fucking the algorithm machine monster
if this wasn't a cry for help I don't know what is.
The stretch marks make me disgusted
We are the crystal gems We’ll always save the day And if you think we can’t  We’ll throw your life away
Did everyone else see the new version of meatcanyon himself since his first slumber party story animation
Falls back on sexual tension…  Cuts it by falling back on sexual tension.  LMAO
he hid a promo to his second channel behind a clever opening and thumbnail hes a fucking mad genius because he knows people are gonna click on this
i wish that was me :/
Oh Mmmm more wholesome content. Subs
Literally there is no video of his that dissapoints.
Meat canyon is really normal looking in this and it surprises me a lot
MeatCanyon stayed true to his art form by making his animated form uglier than his real self  Unlike dream lol
Truly the greatest promotional video of all time
Accurate interpretation of the fanbase
Waiting for Schlatt to comment on this
Since alot of the recent content on Papa Meat has brought up your older stuff, i went back and watch some of those old animations and i have to say, the improvement is quite remarkable. Dont sell yourself short, every video you do is a banger from your full blown animation projects to random stuff like the video on disney employees. Keep up the good work!
That's one way to advertise your 2nd channel
0:26 looks like drachenlord
NAH VROO THE STRETCH MARKS 💀
Steven built like Nikocado
"Please dont be mad at me" i died on the inside. And outside.
How about you make a video durk not sliding for von
I was at the papameat channel since the beginning
I would watch a 2 minute video of just a jpeg
Can you do a phill swift or grallia glue one
Another amazing video I didn’t expect
what did I just watch........
Sick twist bro
damn
Back in the days we hade Ren and Stimpy. Now we have papa meat cartoons. Theres Hope for the future.
Steven Universe spanks Chris Rock with a YouTube Play Button would be the ultimate video.
The fuck meatcanyon lmfao
Love how all the top comments from verified channels that no one’s ever heard of are just vague enough to be applicable to every single one of meatcanyon’s videos and yet add nothing, but in this case they just look stupid since they don’t apply at all or even acknowledge the twist.
Yeeeesssss
...is this a cry for help?
Shits good af I give it 5stars
"I do fall back on that a lot." Proceeds to sexualize the fking youtube logo in the next 15 seconds.
Holy meta
I love how after admitting how frequently he falls back on sexual tension, he immediately falls back on sexual tension.
Fresh twist, love it. Should do more of these mashups
The algorithm is really gonna love this
Thank you for not bringing me the nightmare Steven Universe/Pink Diamond mashup I was terrified of seeing, even though I clicked on the video knowing that I would probably see that!
The truth of how Steven Lesbo verse would look if animated properly.
YES FINALLY
Me: I'm sorry, I cant do it. Steven Universe is my childhood. Papa Meat: Looks with a knowing smile at this youtube stats, he knows I watched it. And definitely didnt regret it
I'll have to read trough the neverending story again for that sweet, sweet nostalgia.
Meatcanyon drawing his own internal turmoil is a whole new level of uncanny.
Here before a million? That’s a first!
Yo
Is this a metaphor?
The Schlatt part was pretty good
What is more powerful plot armour or freindship
This is my introduction to Steven Universe. 🤣
when meat becomes meta
I'm glad i have to do this to *SURVIVE* lmao bruh
The youtube algorithm sounds exactly like final boss veigar from LoL 🤔
Ngl Papa Meat has to be so exhausted after having to do this for so long, at least he can have fun with it otherwise now 🥲
I joined you a long time ago!
Oh no
Truly the greatest love story ever told 😆
I actually wanted a video on Steven Universe video. Not another YouTuber that halfs their main content for a 2nd channel that nobody but the pararelationship viewers watch announcement video. This just means Papa Meat has met there climax, their peak. Welp, I'll just expect this to be another YouTube channel that will be on my sub list that puts out a quality video every 6 months, if even.
it's 3am I should be asleep
i like this i appreciate this its very artistic and thoughtful but i also appreciate most of all is how i didnt really feel anything until the very very end
Think I might be tryin to sniff out some troubbbllleeee ~
I will gladly take your sausage fingers and roam the free lands of sanity with you, papa
It’s finally here… https://youtu.be/SPLl7UgvuLE
NOOOOOOOOOO not Steven universe🥲
…
Love that Never Ending Story reference at the end there lol
This is amazing haha
if your video wasn't a joke. just wanna let you know... you don't have to force it
At least this Steven Universe is less disgusting and not made to groom children like the original.
was I the only one who got moist when Meat Canyon called himself "daddy"? D:
I love papa's second channel we can actually see more side of him and he's just as funny as his animations and also very wholesome and entertaining
I love you, Papa Meat.
"Doing this to survive" ... Bro, aren't you like a millionaire at this point thanks to Youtube?
Why is this funny
Lmao the jachlatt impersonation was hilarious man😂
"I'm about to make your ass as bear as her head"🤣 Best thing I've heard today ngl
The end when he is riding away is pure gold. Incredible art papa meat
The belly stretches bro
Why why are you doing this to my childhood why
GaY!!!!!
wow, I would have never guessed in a million years that a meat canyon and demonic robotic youtube algorithm serpent ship would exist.  ok internet, you know what to do
Lets fly 🐧
I ship
anyone got some bleach?
Lol
"....AND YOU THE VIEWER"
Here we are in the future
Frm this vid alone, We technically had 4 animations in total which is an absolute win/win situation.
Steven universe Was so good and had such a good story and plot line.
What about…marvel
I'll join
WOW Papa Meat!  The YouTube algorithm looked like a shuriken centipede, I am here fo' it! Now if we can just get the YouTube algorithm to fly over to Nikocado Avocado's belly and James Charles' BBL and start a slicin' and dicin'! 🤣🤣🤣
Glad he always trying to ruin everyones childhood from his owns from the kids who was born in the mid to late 2000's
This guy's gunna an hero oneday...
Nigga what was shaggy doing to scoob?😭😭😭
I will embark upon this voyage with you, I've come this far
"Think I might be trying to sniff out some trouble"
Smoothest self-plug-in in the history of time.
Oh god EDIT: OH thank god Steven Universe was short I'd be so disturbed
Sad hoped you would use the 4million XD
Broke the 4th wall a bit earlier than I expected but yeah...
I hate you for this BUT LOVE U FOR DOING IT TOO!!!!!!
The shlat one was good tho
You go Meat man
I was subed to Papa Meat before Meat Canyon somehow
“I’ve been hurt before” Probably by Elsagate.
You did yourself so dirty with that drawing of yourself haha
Hey if you dont want to make videos. I dont care. I got what i wanted.
His second channel is actually better, js
I just realized I've been seeing your videos since Jawbreaker but I never subscribed.
Always fire, Pepperidge farms will remember
MeatCanyon knows the impact that Will Smith expected his smack was when he did it vs. reality.
Bro, now you need to get that mullet
I clicked on this video thinking that it was going to be a weird fetish thing, I'm happy it didn't turn out that way
Why Steven look like a discord moderator
It's hard making history everyday
The self awareness is haunting in and of itself
This man spits facts about people.
Ohkay, the Never Ending Story reference officially killed me. I am a zombie now.
Well, everyone's gotta make a livin somehow
I was liking the Steven
Not only did I get clickbaited, but ……… Nah that’s it, I just got click baited
Instead of it being freaky, and not to heart warming this is pretty damn funny papa meat.
clickbait.
Oooo this is ducking weird
I am dead, you killed me XD I am lost for words, GG video
Haha le funni faces
I loved this more then i should lol
Is there a double like button
Wholesome youtube and papa meat relationship X3
I wish he actually did a Steven Universe whole video. Just seeing Steven like that makes me want more
"I fall back on that a lot." Proceeds to do it again almost immediately. Never change MC.
YOOOOOOO MeatCanyon drew him self let's funking GOOOOOOOO
I'm gonna bury my brain so I won't have to think of this anymore
I didn't even expect the channel promo but damn It was well placed 😭
WTF did I just watch
Bruh I subscribed to that channel the day you made it
...
😞😞😞
LOOOL SUBCRIBES TO THE SECOND CHANEL LOOOL  THIS MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD SO RANDOM
Do you think its the PapaMeat channel? I feel suspicious.....
This is my therapy. This is my happy time.
Papa meats animation styles is incredible
How to creep out the Steven Universe Fandom
This new season of Steven universe is amazing
0:42 wasnt expecting that
I found this channel thanks to chris from aboard in japan and its amazing
Normal YT:ber "Hey I have a second channel go and watch it"  PAPA: Makes a whole well animated, well paced video
A rare sight of a discord moderator outside
It’s alright if you’re going through a writer’s/artistic block, Meat 🙂 Im pretty sure all of your fans will continue to follow you and be patient. Thank you for all of your creativity so far!
Nooooooo not Stevennnnnnnn 💀🤣🤣😊🤣😫😆🤣🤣🤣🤣
No no plz not my brain
One of my friends looks like Steven Universe, and now whenever I see Steven I think of him.
Should start an interdimensional cable show
Nice
Neverending stor-eeeeeee nanananananananana!
"I'm glad I have to do this to survice" I want that on a bumper sticker!
And I seriously thought here was some killer content I could share with "Stephen universe" "fans", which I now have to enjoy myself.
How painful was it to ride that?
"I have to do this in order to survive!"  Eh, I've had to do worse.  Much worse.
Thas what youtube looks like lol
For real though that Steven Universe one looks like the start of something great.
Lmao tf
I’m scared for his eventual Kim Possible video
Woah that was pretty meta.
I was absolutely not ready for this shit but i love it. Been following your second channel for probably 265 years now.
Early
s
THE NEVERENDING FUCKING STORY TOWARDS THE END ❤️ Riding off on Alg-Cor the trend dragon
...Well...This took a 360 degree turn.
1:27
Fuck yeah dude!
NGL this is quite possiblely the single best plug to a second channel that has ever been made.
shit I'm not feeding the YouTube algorithm monster anymore. I'm done!
The world and all of it's creators need to see this
2:00  Goddamn
Nft’s
Do the Simpson’s next daddy x
😆
YouTube is insane
Happy end?
The truth about content creation.
youtube has gone to shit but i love the videos you make .
wholesome
You’re our slave now. Now make another cartoon for us to watch!
I feel like this is a bit aggressive lol but ok
stark honestly.  Just keep in mind, for many your livelihood is the dream for a lot of people out there.  You are in more control over your life than you realize meatcanyon.
Теперь кому-то придётся переводить сразу два ютуб канала.
Rats I was hoping this would vanilla controversy. You would have pissed off Steven Universe fans.
We artist do we shit to survive, and I like that weird shit
"I'm glad I have to do this to survive"
I'm guessing the youtube demon/monster is inspired by the creatures from 9?
This got way too meta.
Damn dude, even with 4 million subs he's still struggling? That's kinda nuts.
This Jschlatt xd
What a rollercoaster
do not gunmouth
I'm surprised he didn't do the amazing world of gumball yet
I saw the reference at the end and said ooohhh noooo
Meatcanyon is ruining my childhood but why do I like it
You need to do an I am poppi
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO why did have to come fo steven universe IT was INNOCENT IT was INNOCENT AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
the Jschlatt cameo caught me so off guard lmao
This is just the show
lol the never ending story ending killed me XD
I want to see an awesome anime battle between YouTube and it's creators
Bro
Clearly this a cry for help...
Shh Shh, don't stop now keep going
Never ending story
This is like 3 different topics in one. How you gonna make the Ty algorithm the big ass dog thing from never ending story😂
So you're saying we wont get Will Smith taking Chris OTK. I'm disappointed.
Top teir content, you never know what you’re gunna get just from the thumbnail and i love it, and amazing animation/voice acting as always.
Have you done Shrek yet
I won't see your second shitty cartoon
*scrolling* “Do I want to watch this?” Curiosity always wins with meat canyon videos
You need a show on Adult Swim asap
I have been having a miserable past few months and today has been terrible but I sat down and watched this and felt joy and laughter so thank you for your hard work. Made my day
I’ve already seen it and it’s great
YouTube went from Villain to E-girl.
Do encanto
Do turning red
“Yeah, I tend to fall back on sexual tension a lot” Immediately starts seducing the YouTube algorithm monster. I love it.
Oh my God....
Bababouwey
We will meaty we will 🥺
Honestly that will smith Chris rock on would have been hilarious to watch
"In the end it turned into weird sexual tension..." "You got me there, I fall back on that a lot..." 5 seconds later... "OH YEAH, Daddy did you wrong baby... Daddy did you dirty..." "Y-yyeeaahhh... Mmm"  I mean he never said he would stop...
Can always do Monster Lab shorts...
Brilliant
I hope to see more of animated hunter!
Why are you just now announcing your second channel? 😂
I love how meat just acknowledge he always end up with weird sexual tension.
Dang hearing people say steven universe was part of their childhood makes me feel old... But then again it was first released 2013
E
3:07 did anyone else get reminded of "The Neverending Story"
ALSO CHECK OUT HIS LIVESTREAMS AT TWITCH.TV/MEATCANYON
Is this channel capable of meatcanyonize Flapjack?
Can you do chowder
the jschlatt joke :D
Low key want to see the rest of will smith spanking Chris 😅
Did we just see vent art turned into a promo for his second channel turned back into vent art?
Love this so much
0:38 makes me kill myself! If these cheeks had balls on his face! He tries cookies..
Steven the Reddit mod
omg i reported like 40 bots meatboy
Ive been hurt before..
man ur sick....                      (i love u)
Dude if you ever need a break you totaly earned it! We love you papa!
😂🤣😂💕
So that is in his belly.
niice
I was in the middle of eating and I choked on my food when you said "daddy did you wrong" eughhhhhh I wish I was deaf
This really was one of the funniest ones ever. Great job. Lighting and animation was incredible as well
And now my adulthood is ruined to. Thanks.
meat daddy animated is the best thing ive seen on this horrible site in a while :")
It brings life in me when this dude uplinks 😍🥰
You scare me... but like in the best way
HELP WHaT
These videos do not make me want to eat….
Is this a por  Account deleted
The youtube caterpillar
😂
Wow meat Canyon having writers blockers 👁👄👁😳😱is the world really coming too an end for real this time or is he trolling us 🧐🤔me at the of the video 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️he trolled so hard
Lmfao
This is exacty what I've come to love about your content. The Never Ending Story callback was classic.
💙💙💙💙💙　💙💙　💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
“And give me the stability I need to not put a gun in my mouth” deepest shit I’ve ever heard
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
The reason YouTube algorithm is in a rush is because their bedtimes in 2 minutes
We love you Papa
Imagine wanting to survive, that's exactly what Daddy YouTube wants, the will to live over the will to make content.
Lmfao that scream at the end, Papa Meat is as funny as the main channel!!
Too bad I'm omphalophobic
not really a comment for this video; but the topic.   new modern corperate bland youtube needs to diverge from actual youtube.  soon.
unexpected...
Big cringe and a self plug I love it. Give me more, silly cartoon man.  You will dance... you will dance for ME.
well, this made me sub to the second channel
U should use me to make more videos
I used to watch this show as a kid... a lot... I was prepared for all the mockery but instead I got something slightly more heart warming, so thank you! That said, you are still free to mock me relentlessly!
Armagetten
Steven Universe (The Show) turns 10 years old tomorrow ;-;
Papa meat sweetening up the YouTube algorithm
This is amazing. Extremely good and realistic. I really feel like this is how YouTube works.😂
“Yeah I fall back on sexual tension a lot.” Immediately falls back on sexual tension. 🤣🤣
Holy shit this is so meta. I love it
If Meatcanyon created Steven universe
Hunters earnest effort to date to shill his second channel. But guys, seriously…no seriously…guys…subscrib to his other channel and become his Patreon today. Don’t let his beautiful creations cease to be shown their beauty to this ugly world. All it takes…is less than 25 seconds to click the link to his other channel.
God I love how the first scene and the title end up having nothing to do with the rest of the video
This was a masterpiece in of itself 🤣🤣🤣
Keep up good content boss man
a
He new Steven Universe was already creepy and perverse.
It comforts me that someone shares the same darkness as I
absolutely loved the never ending story reference! Big epic much love
I'm glad MeatCaynon is doing his own unique thing on his second channel instead of animations all the time
Been there for a while now, My lord of reverting childhoods
Now this... *THIS* is a masterpiece.
That Youtube worm looks like the roughest ride of Hunters life
Nawwwwwwwww this fr werid
the fact that he took the time to actually draw schlatt with nutsack sideburns is amazing       edit: why is this getting so many likes??
Is this *LORE?!?!?*
The sad thing is is that I ate before watching this
I'm so god damn scared rn
Weird sexual tension with the agly wrhythmthm
So aesthetic 🥰
Ah, Remember those good, happy moments when this video wasn't posted yet.
Not sure if the ending is a cry for help or just another joke
Cursed 👁👅👁👌
Its hard to convince rey (or another anakin) a better animated austin powers parody.
poggers
e
Daddy meat at it again 😂
This was so silly and i loved every moment of it.  Imagine getting to draw yourself riding the youtube algorithm monster into the skys.  wonderful.
niga giga
God, I mean, meatcanyon, thank YouTube you are here
This brought an uncanny amount of joy to my day, thank you father flesh 🙏
“That’s too inappropriate!”                                      All of meats videos:Allow us to introduce ourselves.
This is somehow better than the entire season of the show.
You nailed the meatcanyon voice👏
This is your magnum opus
This brings me joy.
03:07 When MeatCanyon finally does The Neverending Story "Come Atreyu...Come to Falcor and MOUNT me. It will be like flying!"  Atreyu - "Are you a luck dragon?"   Falcor -menacing laughter- "I'm not a luck dragon, I'm a f**kdragon". Camera slowly pulls back as Falcor mounts Atreyu to reveal Bastion hiding in the bushes, watching guiltily and taking his shirt off. Camera pans to the side to reveal the empress standing beside him, choking Bastion out with a leather studded dog leash. "SAY MY NAME BASTION!"
NGL, I prefer the content on Papa Meat! I could watch Hunter draw rediculous shit all day. The guy is genuinely hilarious.
So why didn't steven turn himself into an epic LOOKING protagonist
0:20 Half the reason this scene exists is just to witness that beard animation 🔥
meta
Meat canyon do mr meaty
Do gravity falls
This is hot. This turned out to be hot.
I have never seen Steven Universe
You wonderfull caricature of a man,another Great video!!!
This feels like clickbate
I already subscribed long time ago ^^
And I will never be the same.
This is meaty’s equivalent to inter dimensional cable
You click baiting mf ok
I just wish he really made a steven universe vid
Dude you NEED TO GET DOWN ON HARD ROCK NICK!!! You are the best out there and this giant turd gives you WAY more than enough to work with
Daddy has us covered
WTF
😂
Felt the line of the " stability to not put a gun in my mouth" 🥲😂
Meaty breaking the 4th wall???
What’s… what’s stopping him from making those videos on this channel? He’s already got the following here.
Best ad for a 2nd channel, ever.
Well played sir well played.
i love you
0   0    _  What
is it just me or is the animation smoother
he looks like meatcanyon in the cartoon
Thank you for not ruining Steven Universe 🥺
Fuck all haters
Ads are getting smarter.
THANK YOU DA DA
IT WAS LIKE 10 seconds of su and then everything else 😂
Trinston was here. .
Here, wizards with guns
Terrific man
The way you drew YouTube is AMAZING.
subscribed ages ago ;)
Meat canyon has to he watching my life dude I just finished this series eith my sister and he posted it
That's a such a cool design for the YouTube algorithm! I would love to see some kind of merch/art thing to come out of this
Why does the algorithm’s voice remind me of sundrop’s
The rest of the Crystal Gems are probably on crystal meth
He is his own mother making it literal could always work
Matrix vibes
best self advertisement on youtube, I think the algorithm will be very pleased with this
Really wish all these changes didn't shaft animators. I still remember animators having to either straight up quit youtube or move on to what everyone else was doing on youtube. It was quite the darkest of times.
Beautiful... Simply free
what is this
This has got to be the one MeatCanyon episode I don’t wanna watch… But I will anyway Edit: I wasn’t disappointed
You could use your Reddit for video inspiration
I like your older parody content. This is just kind of weird
XD I honestly did not expect this one at all in the direction that it went. I loved it! ^-^
He's gotta do xj9
I hate this weird algorithm-based future.
I didnt think he was ever going to do steven universe. Im horrifyied but happy at the same time
I haven’t started the video yet and I’m already screaming nooooooo
Wow bro!!!
Gotta hurt riding on the back of that algorithm
Best but wierdest birthday gift
Saw the thumb nail, and I was like "no, not Steven" then I watched t, and I was like " love ya papa meat, do what ever u want"  lmao
"I fall back on that a lot"  Falls back on it.
When are you going to violate Fosters Home for Imaginary Friends?
That laugh at the end put the biggest smile on my face. Keep up the good work Papa Meat!
This is fucking incredible
I wasn't expecting this like at all, I was thinking you were going to make these gem abominations but instead it's just a plug for your second channel (which btw I've been subscribed to)   Good job mr. Canyon
The YouTube Algorithm being a combination of Falcor and Starscream is fantastic.
Screams from the Golden Arches 2
Thank you meat
he finally listened to cody
The first click bait that I’m happy to watch
Hahahahahahahahahahahah
I was curious about where that SU scene was going to go.
Ayo sorry steven your a chubby boi.
I have subscribe to you so I’m dedicated to you
This was all just an ad for your second channel?! You’re a bastard and I’ll see you over there!
Imagine the Steven universe fandom watching this video
What the fuck did I just watch
😱
Well you know you can just ask an AI to give you a topical trendy idea, try GPT-3
Subbing to ur second channel just because of the respect i have for u
God I fucking love you dude 🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been hurt before 😂😂😂😂
Man I subbed the second you mentioned it months ago.
Love how meta this video is
Give him the stability 2 not put a gun n his mouth lmao Thats how i feel everyday
Meat Canyon you don't disappoint good on you sticking it to the YouTube dweebs
You have a fabulous mullet
We all thought it was a bit but Family Guy actually infected Meat
Can you make a Susan Wojcicki cartoon, please? :)
happy to be early
2:07 what that song ?
Bro this man is a comedy and entertainment genius
New content needed NOW! That’s cool I know your good for it.
feels like a fever deam
Dude, been here since the beginning…and from one artist to another, I’m super proud of what you doing. Keep it up, bud.
holy fuck
I'm hooked
Sorta looks like you lol
So is this a hint at "A Never Ending MeatCanyon"? because that was golden.
I cant breathe he animated his neckbeard i cant
1:26 the best moment
Bro we need some regular show…
Clever😂
OH NO,U MONSTER HAHAHAHAHAHAHA  HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA This is just to good
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO CHALK ZONE NEXT 😂😂😂😍
F
Curse my eyes
uhh, that's an AD ... I thought I used an ADblocker ?
Wth is that guy he doesn't even look like Steven anymore lol
“Daddy’s got you”  Lmao 🤣
Daddy has got us guys
Oh boy how lucky i am to once again find myself in both the presence of a meal I just prepared myself and a new MeatCanyon video popping up into my recommended videos.
This one i really loved.
Ahaha, I appreciated how different this was! Thanks for the laughs!
Youtube is killing itself.
*Anything is possible through friendship* I'm sorry Steven but you don't look like a character from My Little Pony to me.
Did you just seduce your way out of demonetization ?
Nice.
Animation idea, Jerma985 but he's a psycho. Surprising, I know.
My childhood my favorite show I never thought it would come to this😭😭😭😭😭
i have a great idea for a video you should do a bill swift video btw i love youre creepy ass art work and i love you
This mans cartoons have cured my depression If you ever read this meatcanyon I thank you for all the gut busting laughs you have made me have over the last few years you truly are a fucking legend and if anyone says otherwise I will make them witness paradise for free instead of 25 cents
For a sec, I thought the scary algo-snake-bot- thing was us viewers as a Legion-like construct, nibbling at the toes of creation.  We'd make a good amalgamat horror, yall.
really missed the opportunity of it all just being a drug trip
Yesss new video
Steven is a nazi apologist for illegal aliens and humans
Meat animating himself about his creative process and how he feels like he has to keep pumping out content,  is some creepy meta shit and I love it
Daddy’s here, Daddy’s got you 🤣 thank you for the constant content!
As a Steven Universe fan I would definitely declare that scene cannon
Came here for Steven Universe Stayed for Papa Meat
The algorithm monster is pretty cool tbh
this is a great revelation.
Friendship is magic 🚨🗿
I laughed too hard with this one.
I love this shit bro man
This is so Meta but in a very awkward way
wait until he does my little pony … 👁👁
Meta af
Five nights at YouTube
Peak content
I asked for will Smith and you actually did it that's awesome dude thank you hahaaa
Waiting for this day . . . sadly
IT’S MY BIRTHDAY!!! This is an awesome birthday present 😁
please never publish a video again
Omfg this was so needed my dude. Thanks for speaking up for yourself mayne
I was really hoping to see Will Smith liquify Chris Rocks ass 🥹
PAPAPAPAPAPAPAPAPPAMEAT
I like how most of the comments are generic and reused from other videos
I'm putting a gun im my mouth as we speak
Meatcanyon always does fall back on secual tension voice but GOD!...damn... does it make come back wanting for more of thag succulent voice in my  ears.
Real shit
THE WILL SMITH ONE 💀💀💀
Algorithm
Powerpuff girls is a wide territory to explore !
That’s it, mate’s lost it lmao
"I am glad I have to do this to survive" being yelled out with both existential dread AND enthusiasm made me laugh so hard that I am physically spasming. Oh, I think that comedy really touched the fears and anxieties I have in a way that released the tension involuntarily as great does.
wow
I’m never watching Steven universe ever again.
"daddy did you wrong" haha
Look how they massacred my boi
Worth the clickbait
Draw talking Ben.
Yes Papa Meat. We will join you. Don't worry, we got your back. Some of us will always be back for more of your secret formula, whether it's finely crafted parodies, podcasts, original cartoons, reviews, or just you being yourself.
I really liked the representation of YouTube's algorithm as a insatiable-content monster. Probably because it feels that way.  (1:59 there's a mistake in the layer that bug me out a little bit, but that doesn't ruin the video :D)
Congrats you turned my 1# childhood cartoon
Honestly, this is how YouTube will probably dig itself into a deep deep *DEEP* grave. They expect a routinely upload schedule to please the algorithm, but its this mystery system that has vaguely defined parts, so YouTubers flounder around trying to figure it out how to keep themselves sustainable.   Second Channel? Sure, that'll work for now, but what if the algorithm decides to just group channels controlled by the same person(s) together and the channels that don't upload regularly bring the other ones down because the algorithm would only see that person(s)' total upload rate for all their combined channels, not for each individual channel, and stop promoting them overall? We don't know, so that solution may suddenly disappear.  Just seems like to me, YouTube is trying to squeeze out independent creators or stress them out so much that they cave and forgo their vision for the sake of keeping up with the strict schedule of the monetary world of continuous dopamine delivery content, where everyone just does their own interpretation of recent events, forgets about it and then moves on to the next thing. Where's the value in that?
Steven Universe and Son of Sam collab
Papa Meat 😩🥵
@MeatCanyon uuh you could take a break and not destroy your channel, you know XD We love your work, but you aren't our prisoner.
Not Steven….
This is peak meta
Canyon chain
Hi
This has got to be the best commercial ever.
I'm fucking dead 😂😂😂
The jachlatt bit was perfect
this was an amazing illustration of your art and your mindset while making it.
What an acid trip.
I’m eating rn😭
Ayeeee
Meta
this was so bizarre and so beautiful at the same time hahaha Papa Meet always showing that he is the best
When it's finally my turn to have my childhood ruined 😸
I remember my first Meat Canyon video. How dark and fun the rabbit hole has become.
The best time spent on YouTube
Why did I burst into laughter at the end when Meat laughed? 😆
Hey Papa Meat I use to do Photoshop in highschool and I got out of it. But I'm now getting back into it so if there is anything you need done with photoshop id like to offer my services. I need something to do to get use to the new software. And I figured if it would be help to you then it would be worth it.
is so weird I love it 3:00
Wow just wow
I WILL JOIN YOU, PAPA MEAT
We finally get to see Pappa Meat in cartoon form.
I will join u my friend
This version of Schlatt will forever be burned into my retinas
I joined on that adventure a way back but I will grab your dorito encrusted hand and FLY.
As much as i dont want to bodyshame anyone, his stretch marks give me shivers.
Breaking the 4th wall to call out YouTube and promo his second channel lol
Hmmm
...Does this makes Youtube Algorithm Monster our new waifu?
Meat canyon’s mind must be horrifying to look in
I'm glad he enjoys papameat, him reviewing and interacting with his viewers drawing is pretty entertaining
Papa meat you're the only homeboy that can rock that very dubious hairstyle. Gj
Use Steven method to convince YouTube machine to seek agreement, hope Family Guy or South Park would be next, god speed
God bless you. You magnificent Trucker looking son of a bitch.
I love this man.
*NEVERENDING STORIEEE!!!*
this is great back 2 back uploads from meat 🥰
You should do calernace:)
Hilarious. You're a great creator
:O
Wow. That took a whole different direction than I thought it would. 😯
I thought that was Nickacado for a sec
How about Vtubers, like Gura
Making the youtube algorhythm a deathly vile creature with an endearing style and voice is surprisingly accurate.
uhhhh
No. I’d rather you’d put a gun in your mouth. But then you pulled off a never ending story reference at the end. Ok. Okay. Second Chanel is approved.
Isn't it time to mess with meet the Robinsons or rollie pollie ollie?
Great work papa meat
Never thought I'd see the YouTube algorithm oddly sexualized, but this is the least surprising place for it to have happened.
Only Meatcanyon has the raw elemental power to make mullets _sexy again._  _...and make you question yourself why._
What the heck
i wanna cry
Jschlatt facial hair my God dude XD looking wiser every day xD
I would love to have a self portrait made by this beautiful man.
The gig economy strikes again
One of the best ones yet and it’s just a shill for the second Chanel. This mans creativity is amazing
Every time I watch Meat Canyon, I always ask myself..."what the f*** am I watching?"
Plot twist he ate his mom
That Neverending Story reference at the end was special.
<3 your animations are awesome.
You always post when I'm eating damnit
Yo what is this?
Somehow Steven Universe is still GAYER than this 🤣
Finally I’ve been waiting for this
Is this foreshadowing something in future?
I was expecting something that would make me wanna puke... but this got so deep and meta XD
Beautiful
With how terrifying Papa Meat makes my childhood favorites, I'm genuinely afraid to see what he could do if he tried to make a legit Horror skit.
GLAD I HAVE TO DO THIS TO SURVIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SOOO GOOD!!
You need more of the Steven Universes BIG BELLY!!
I having nightmares today
Please do Adventure Time!
I'm going to go out on a limb and say I vastly prefer the papa meat channel over the main one. Don't get me wrong I love Hunter and all his wacky corrupt art but it's really heartwarming and refreshing to see him just have fun on his second channel it oozes creativity and style plus I get to see his cute face more often 😍 keep up the great work bro ❤️
Why are his stretch marks so fresh… wtf man.
Imma need him on smiling friends now 🤣
You, uh…you ain’t have to scare me with that Steven Universe clip, thought my childhood was about to get shook.
Just do a meta cartoon of trans tumblr artists making Steven Universe cartoon porn. That's more inappropriate sexual tension than you can shake a stick at.
Hope about Masked Rider Meatcanyon, an anniversary series about every culture that you make fun of in epic videos, Katz and UNO use stereotype stamps to fight evil villains for abusing your imagination to bring chaos.
Neverending Story vibes. Goddammit Papa Meat.
You should make a video about Danielle bregoli on doctor Phil lol.
F*ckin' right, I'm on board!
Of all of your animations the YouTube algorithm monster and the poke at Steven universe is amazing I love this
The HALgorithm monster is voiced by Matt Watson?
Bro make dat Will Smith-Chris Rock one! MAKE DAT SHIT!
Every video is a fuckin hit lmao
I gladly offer up this comment in hopes that it will earn you, MeatCanyon, succor as you carry out your purpose, and strive to feed the mass's insatiable hunger for entertainment. Hail, Algorithm, those who are about to commit to weekly content uploads salute you.
I feel like there was something different in my crack.
I'm going to cry, idk if it's from how beautiful it is or how horrifying
I live for all ur videos
Finally shouted out papa meat
u should make a weirder version of clarence
Oh so where not talking about the Chris rock will smith clip 😂 bruh
Even Papa Meats not safe from himself
I was kinda hoping we’d see horrific versions of Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl.
I got bricked up watching him caress his stomach
I swear you just made my day.Best content creator on YouTube period.
hey you fat talented artist,  do a joel haver collab. yw. everyone like this comment so he will be pressured into doing it
Somehow better that SU seasons 3,4,5 and future together
Man, it's a good thing you're married. You're an Adonis when put to animation. 😍
I'm glad invaders zim has been  Spared from nightmare fuel
MeatCanyon Multiverse
It is time.
Wtf
Mood
Oh my god no. Why 😭😭😭
Not I've been hurt before
this is great
Love the never ending story bit
“Fat Bob Ross” this why I don’t watch Steven universe much-
I loved that he drew himself and they made YT as a villain
Let me tell you when I saw Jschlatt I JUMPED
No dude you are way fatter, in a good way
"Quickly!"  Angry Beavers trying to defend their forest/river from poachers Rocko's Modern Life but it's about the modern disconnect from each other, incels, etc Doug but it's To Catch a Predator with the weird rich older neighbor that's always trying to get Doug to look at his new toys Dexter's lab but it turns out Dexter just retreated into his fantasy world to avoid reality but never bothered achieving any skills or actual talents
This is just fucking genius, every single thought this man has is literally genius.
Nah! Pass.... Let's keep this one going, 'mkay?
We dont call him Papa meat for nothing. 2:00
Lol, felt like I was right there with ya with this one papa🤣🤣.
Hunter are you okay
papa meat need  vacation
You've done it. Nothing is sacred anymore
Is youtube inspired by 9?
Not what I was expecting but I love it
I really wanted to see a steven universe parodie about lesbianism or something like that, but i will follow you second channel my lord, i will eat all your sweet sweet poppy sweet treats and i will on your toes until the new roman kingdom arrives, until the im devoted to you, my soul, my meat, my blood, my conciusness, everything... To you...
fcing good stuff u put in this vid man
Nooooo not steven brooo 😭😭
CoryXKenshin beware this video
These are just files Papa Canyon had on his PC for weeks made into a compilation. I love it. 💕
This Youtube monster is so awesome I would like to see someone making an "action figure" of it.
First
🤣
I love your voice acting and your animations. Dont burn yourself out but keep up the good work
What the fuck did I just see
I wonder what's next, jojo? Also nice video I love to watch them when I'm bored
As sick an twisted as this show is you somehow made it even more twisted.
Meatcanyon: join my 2nd youtube channel guys  Me: RoOoOoOuGhRoOoOoOoRoO!
I don't get it though, why having a second channel and doing stuff there when you could do the same on the first? I am definitely not understanding how any of this works.
I get on here daily to check for new videos ngl. But honestly it's just. They're so good 🤣 but yk what, fuck it. I'm gonna watch every video on your second channel. Love ya meat.
Wtf this is a children's show? It has like bisexual and gay characters and all that, whoever made the show is weird with kids
2:49 "Meh, a second channel...." 2:50 "But where, where?
LMFAIAOOAOAOOOOO
This.... Have a happy ending?
The Meatcanyon Family Guy episode with cutaways and all lol I love it
Did meat canyon just animate himself 🤣🤣
It was a ruse, not complaining though.
I really thought this was going to be a Steven universe animation
What a Papa Meat ad, you sir have skill
I…..fuck he got to Steven universe
I'm worried you man. Maybe seek therapy? God bless.
Cholesterol
Meat canyon is like the spirit of our fake childhoods clapping back at society…and I love it!! All of it… I need moooooore (meat voice)
Daddy youtube wants videos
Imagine the youtube algorithm comes back and attacks him after he finds out the meatcanyon clickbaited us XD.
Engagement > Algorythm > ? > Profit
Shouldn't he be crying and singing?
I really liked the “Schlatt”one. That was funny.
Yes in every way possible
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM!!
Keep up the good work PapaMeat!
Us rn 🤝
CLICK BAIT
I think its about time to make an Amber Heard abusing Johnny Depp video. Pretty much like the Garfield one except Amber would be a giant pain demon. Just my thoughts.
Steven Uber eats
Doc ock algorithm
And THEN he give birth to Youtube Algorithm's babies and lived happily after
why hasn't adult swim picked up MeatCanyon, yet?
Oh I was already subscribed but I stayed for the animation lol
What inspired your Disturbingness?
I was like hell yeah meatcayon toon but then I immediately realized this is just an ad 😂
I thought the Algorithpede was Joel Haver at first.
It’s ok. Daddy’s got you…
youtube looks like a Phyrexian from magic the gathering
3:12 is he... riding the spikes on his back?
Wtf
Your second channel is like those blindfolded fellas in John's basement from that Garfield skit you did. I know it's there. I may want to look at it for a moment out of sheer curiosity from time to time and laugh at them,...uh, it.....buuut, for the most part, I'd rather stay out of a lunatic's house. Now, this MeatCanyon channel, or picking on Don from CreamCrew, now that's something I can roll around in for quality time!
As far as I’m concerned, MeatCanyon is the second channel, now.
i love you thabkyou
Early 2000s YouTube was much better 😭
Steven fuses with a creature as he screams in agony while he absorbs more life into his mass.
Here's a video idea: do wilbur's arg but it's much MUCH darker can you do that
The end got me on this one 😂😂 this is the best second channel promo I've ever seen 🤣
Bruh
😭😂😭😂
As a minituber, I can confirm the algorithm does break into my house in the form of a snake and demands me to make new videos.
XD
Whyyyyyyyyyy😂
You know why they call him meat canyon it's because he makes his characters look like meat you get that joke?
Idk if this counts as being clickbaited, anyway yeah, nice video and ngl but the Meatcanyon model looks alot like Dream's dad from the parody
I genuinely thought this whole video would be a Steven universe parody which i didn't quite like and when it cut to you i just felt like we were on the same wavelength
Yoooo brooo🤣🤣. It got so deep then sexual then funny so fast. One of your best animations so far 😂😂
T frick
I finally found out how the youtube algorythm looks like
trust me.....this couldve been worse                              actually i take it back..... i hope youtube sees this XD
NICE
Going meta, nice
Of course I was supporting you there and in all your sick weird shits
So this is how he feels
Oh My gems...
The fact that this was on my recommended huh
The YouTube algorithm machine thing is kinda hot  It's voice ooooo hot
Loved every second. One of your best videos yet.
Oh yeah.  Anything is possible through friendship.
i love this solid lol this is just great aaaahhhhhh
Why he sound like he was from rick and morty💀💀
Oh fuck a new meat anyone episode. Mmmm, fuck.
OMG papus, esto va a estar épico
REBECCA SUGAR would lose her composure seeing that
i wanna see r34 art of meatcanyon having passionate sex with youtube algorithm
I mean, i thought it would be a good day but now that i see this i regret being born. As always
Was this just an Ad for the papa meat channel🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lmao the will smith joke made me die
Laughed so hard my chest hurts!!! Could be the sickness....NO it was the video!!!
Damn, I love MeatCanyon...
The title is literally just stolen from a deviantart post
This is how I feel about the algorithm
Love this!
The Algorithm Monster is REAL! LOL My favorite one in recent memory. Loving the Papa Meat Channel . W
Send this to coryxkenshin
who is the voice
Lol Will on Chris's ass got me
don’t ruin this for me
@meatcanyon This is facts. You don't even know.
Best video.
Love how the youtube algorithm looks like the massacre wurm
Nah
Schizophrenic Steven dies of a staph infection after refusing medical treatment once he inserted a giant rock into his stomach
@2:00 ok look, dont fuck the YouTube algorithm monster meatcanyon.......please. 😅
NOOOOOOO NOT STEVEN MY CHILDHOOD
I’m used to being disturbed when watching this stuff, but not in a cringy way like this
The YouTube monster has to be the ultimate villain in Meatcanyons videos.
This is awesome
Ah yes, Steven universe. The story of an obese child and his lesbian alien family.
Dude, I was scrolling on my feed last time, and I saw a SpongeBob clip. I clicked the video, and somehow I was waiting for it to be in the same situation that you portrayed. I might need some help from an actual therapist.😭
I’m glad you have to do this to survive as well
Welp… I seen this coming
The last part was the best 😆
Omg that jshlatt is so funny
DADDY DID YOU WRONG
The giggle at the end. :)
I'm afraid of taking your hand.....I don't want to know what would happen to me.
Dude I knew you were gonna say something about will smith when the algorithm was impatiently waiting for a trendy idea.
So amazing
His mouth movement is actually incredible, specially considering the beard
make an episode of cow and chicken interacting with their human parents and show their face 😈😈
Hm ug ok
Never forget the difference between doing something on time and doing something right. :)
Yes!
O my lord
We’ll support you man :)
Looks like the new series of Steven universe looks different
Nonono I was hoping you'd never get to this show lmfaooo
Jshlatt testicle sideburns
...
I’m already subbed to your other channel 😎
E
This just got so much better when watching it while having post-nut clarity.
Thought Will Smith was gonna drop a “Looking like a double wide surprise”
not even meatcanyon is safe from meatcanyon
Hahahah omg great videos and art style and always 🤣💀
Coryxkenshin or teen titans go videos
Please do something about shrek
Lmao I like how it just twists into him baby talking to algorithm
Why did u have this to Steven
Youtube:Were Kid Friendly Meanwhile Algorithm:You gotta be specfic  Youtubers:We Have too ya know
No got y
This is compliation i needed today.  Wholsesome Meat Sunday
1st astronaut: "Wait, it was all just an ad for his second channel Papa Meat?" 2nd astronaut: "Always has been."
I hate Steven Universe
yagga
Y
Among us
“Oh yeah” from that point on I knew I was gonna hate Steven for the rest of of my life
I have never so uncomfortable in my entire life
someone knows what’s the jazz song playing when he’s talking to yt?
Yes meat canyon you don't have to follow any algorithm and you should make what makes you happy and what you want and know that we will always like it have a good day Mr meat
best second channel promotional ever. Also, what if cartoon meatcanyon and cartoon papa meat are two different people.
"Daddy did you wrong" lol I love you
I LOVE how the YT algorithm turned into Falcor.
My boy in here seducing a giant robotic bobbit worm
this is the part 2 of nik
One must immerse their self in other content and do other things to get ideas, can’t force yourself to sit and try to come up with ideas, they come from life experiences it’s a light bulb moment
Here's an idea for something Papa Meat can desecrate, Bear in the Big Blue House
Please don't do adventure time it will destroy my body inside out
hunter i love ur shit, please dont hurt yourself
Finally, some BTS content.  And not that shitty Korean band.
*I pray that everyone who is watching this masterpiece becomes really happy and successful in life!*
DEAR GOD
YouTube kids titles be like:
The ending has the same energy as the end to SU, honestly.
ngl stephen universe would be a great source for a parody
Meatcanyon? What program do you use to make animations?
this might be his best yet
You got me with the Neverending Story XD
Tbh, I thought he was gonna fuck the algorithm monster.  I want to see that now.
POV A redditor is talking to you.
Yes I will join you ….. take my blood 🩸
1 video, thousands of lives ruined...
YouTube algorism looking kinda fine
I actually unvolunteerly said "OH GOD" out loud after seeing the thumbnail
Love your videos man Its great to have a good laugh every now and then keep up the good work 💯✊🏾😂❤️
if I wasn't subbed to the second channel already, this would've made me sub  20/10
Bro...
I came for Steven and I stayed for Meat Canyon
That moment you realize that Papa Meat is drawn normally. Edit: Oh he's ok... I think.
Was that a teen titans go reference?
??? What 0:07
Nice video man. I appreciate your hard work. Don't forget that a lot of people like very much your videos. Don't mind the usual fuckers that are always commenting "own this video isn't cursed enough, uuugh this video is so tamee", they are just blood sucking lifeless leeches that are always looking for the same thing and then complain if they don't get what they want. And dude, if you like to make gruesome shit with lots of sexual tension just go on! Don't mind the comments, you started this because you like it, you are not going to be remembered for that, you are going to be remembered for bringing joy to millions of people around the globe, and that's a privilege that not so many people can have. Sorry for my bad English, I'm from Chile 🇨🇱  Cheer up papa! You are doing great things ✨  ❤
You forgot the apostrophe!
Hey look its susan properly depicted
yeah thats youtube alright. great video as always
Schlatt 😂
Idk I think the ballsack sideburns idea had some merit
That was like wucha  fire video
Meatttttttt
uhmm well  SU = Cushing Sd now xD
Papa meat got me... I finally subscribed to his second channel.
You keep ruining my childhood Thanks man!
The horror is always the truth...
This is the best promotion for a youtube channel i’ve ever seen
Pure gold!!!! Love it, especially the hair in my mouth.
Yalll should do something with corykenshin😛😛
this turned out unusually wholesome
the best way to promo a 2nd channel
When will we get horror games review/playthrough?
why does steven's head look like papa meat irl
Early
80
THATS MY GOAT
*Rare spotting of Randy*
THIS VIDEO GAH DAMN
The Youtube Falkorithm
Early
Brruuhhhhh
Bruh, you still gotta drop that Will Smith video though :o
That just reminds me of The Neverending Story ending
112k views in 38mins wow
3:07 Ah yes.  A Never-ending Story reference.  A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
yeah basically
Can't tell if this is a promo or a legitimate cry for help.   Perfect.
I always hated Steven’s nose for some reason , and I see meat also has a similar opinion lol well , I feel like maybe he does 🤷🏽‍♂️
Amazing
Steven my Mijo what did Danny McBride look like do you lol 😆  My God that YouTube robo centipede sound like SpongeBob also lewd statues .? OAO oh my.. [in deep voice]
Fortnite should the next skit tbh
A transcending experience
He looks like a 35 year old internet child molester
No... He did the unthinkable.. He ruined the neverending story. This crime is unforgivable. He must be punished.
Should do one based off Xiaolin Showdown
God dammit NOT HIM NOT HIM
That never ending story music was perfect
This is so meta
Is this man about to fuck YouTube?
Dear Hunter… You are great. Love the second channel!
i love how most of this had barely anything to do with steven universe
I really wanted to see a messed up story with Steven and the Gems
🤣😂😂
I like this
Noice
the will smith part might’ve actually killed me
I love the 2nd channel
unironically love the monster design
Ew
God I love your videos. Even the papameat ones. Your videos bring me joy.
This so so meta
Terraria destroyer
My hero
the never-ending algorithm
Gross. You know Susan is jilling off to Meat talking like that.
Epic
The Meat is entering a new frontier of content creation
i Cant breath wtf is the schlatt thing
This is the video that will attract the new people to the Papa Meat channel.
Is it weird that I wanna ship Meatcanyon with YouTube algorithm? XD     (Relax it's a joke)
I like how MeatCanyon draws himself
69
God bless this man
Oh man
I already thought Steven universe was a weird and creepy show so this doesn't effect me
I fucking that woke show, and I know I'm not the only one
I love the ones that are not parodies. Bring Day Drinking back!
Honestly this is kinda the way it is in all aspects of art whether its drawing, animation, music or whatever else. Do what you love and be creative but make it trendy and make it consistent or you  fuckin die
riding youtube does not look comfortable
Well that escalated quickly, then calmed right back down... tho i cant wait to see the beautiful babies you and youtube monster are going to have.
That was a Neverending Story ending, wasn't it?
I miss the podcast
This is the most intricate way I've seen someone promote their second channel
You ever really think about catdog
Hang on, is there a better way to depict the youtube algorithm than as an evil robotic earwig? .............hmmm....... nope!
STOP IT PLEASE MY CHILDHOOD!!!!
It was click bait but it was worth it.
The fact that I looked up your channel because I hadn’t seen a video from you in a while and this popped up… wow
Neat
He totally wrecked his sack on that algorithm
You ruined the show for me
Holy shit that’s the best thing I have seen in a long time about jschlatt
His hair tho
Today is my 19th birthday. Thank you for your gift Mr. Canyon.
WHOA JSCHLATT WAS IN THIS VIDEO!
Love how he drawed himself a solid pair of manboobs.
O_O
This is the best promotion for a second channel.
Neverending story bit got me
Like to get a here early ticket
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I LOVE MEATCANYONNNN
HAHAHAAHA😂😂 Great video
Meat canyon is so weird we love it
Officially ruined my entire childhood, good job meatcanyon!
My childhood:(
This has to be the greatest channel plug I've ever seen, he could have easily just did a 30sec plug but he went out of his way to animate all this, another reason why papa meat is great
smh
Do clarence next
I love this so much because I really enjoy the second channel alot
I liked getting bamboozled into thinking you were gonna super mess with Steven Universe (more than you already did) but the amount of love you put in for an ad for your second channel under the guise of being another childhood slaughtering animation was so *God damn good*
When Hunter animated is amazing
Damn bruh, I am disgusted once again.
I always thought the bellybutton gem was the most disgusting uncomfortable thing to look at and dwell on in a character design. Those first few seconds do nothing to change this opinion.
Pretty solid, honestly though, Steven is already a monster to begin with.  Us-tube algorithm, how about you beg to have your play button fisted? 😂
very noice
We crave a conclusion to the bob the builder yokai
Is it weird that I think this is my favorite thing you've made??
This video couldn't have ended in any better way. It is just perfection.
Best late April Fool's joke ever 🤣
Bruh YOUTUBE BLUE BALLING YOU😂🥴💯🔥✨
This is horrifiing
Never ending story parody when tho
Wtf did I just watch...
It feels illegal to be here so early
No
*I heard what you said about my wife.*
I may be going out on a limb here, but I think the monster represents the youtube algorithm and the man represents MeatCanyon and the video addresses his struggle with doing what he enjoys but being torn on making videos that he wants vs what the algorithm wants. IDK tho
This I was not expecting. But pleased by it I am
I adore you to pieces... Always and forever!
Ohhh
I love that this is just one big promotion for the Papa Meat channel
Meat canyon your lack of sanity heals me 😊
What the f*** did i f****** watch, i want to get the f*** out of here, please f******* help me! F*** f***
genius
🥵🥵🥵
Ya
Hahahahah bruh i apreciate the honestly
It's funny, but hilariously true.  We all work to please the algorithm.
You fucking rock MeatCanyon.
Bro. Looks like your having some serious anxiety about entertaining or being “good enough” for your audience. Fuckin relax. Don’t let “what ifs” poison what you love. If someone doesn’t appreciate what you do for fun they don’t deserve it.
🤣 love you buddy, let's fly!!!
And to think, if he really wanted to disturb the Steven universe fans, all he would have to do is depict a fat character as skinny and dignified and the fans would be howling like cats in a Cuisinart and would be out for his blood.   This is why I like Meatcanyon, because he doesn't take cartoons too damn seriously.
Sometimes you ride the algorithm, sometimes.. it rides you
Remember to like Meat’s vids if you watch all the way through >:3
Holy shit it's an ad for his second channel
Wholesome?
Dude Hearing You Laughing At Your Own Wildness Is So Fun. I love Both Channels.
Ngl that algorithm design is fire
Love the NeverEnding Story theme that at first sounded like it was taken straight from the movie but then I noticed the melody was different. Gotta make YouTube happy.
Nice earrings...
How did Papa Meat resist putting Steven's gem in his butt or on his groin instead of his belly button? Or at least make the area around the gem throb.
I got a good idea do a cartoon version off Saturday morning cartoons a mash up where they fight and kill each other while the commercials run but we the viewer dosent know.
What about Amber Turd?
The Will Smith one was hilarious
We need more YouTube Algorithm monster robot content
Can we get a finish on that Steven Universe bit
Okay, I did not expect that one coming folks.
Absolutely love the honesty. Amazing video
Your videos feel illegal to watch
Man, I'm glad that I was earlier.
Holy wow I loved this
Bravo. I new the second channel pitch was coming, but I loved the ride. Of course I’m a papameat sub. I hoping to see a monster lab return. 😅👍
Hay meat-canyon can you do a my hero academia with all the characters look normal but have mr.freeze from the Batman animated series version be a mix of his animated counterpart and little bit real and tell deku about how villain are the real hero then some hero’s.  If you like it, then I hope you do it and make it good.
The algorithm was hungry for some meat...right in his deep...canyon...
best  ad ever
You always like some creepy stuff and cured
Not okay
i see youtube as a job while meatcanyon sees it as falcore
You had me at lewd anime statues.
I keep watch 3:12 and giggling like an idiot
Goated content creator
At last . A Steven univers parody!
YEEEEY ;D
Keep up the good animations well you’ve actually got to because of YouTube algorithm
Already subscribed to the second channel lol meatcanyon has been one of my favorites channels almost since it started and I'll be a fan till the day that I die
Niko avocado?
What the fuck
We need more parodys. This AD-animation is pice of shit
This is one of the cleverest videos he has done lol
Gay rocks
Probably the best way to advertise a second channel I've ever seen.
Why have you done this to my childhood.
Jschlatt is definitely a man that would have ballsack on his face
No, no, no, nooooooooo    My childhood🤣😢🤣
This gave me some Worlds End vibes. He's trying to tell us something through comedy
META DO the batman or moon knight 😂 idk 😐
The laugh at the end tho 😂
Where is my Steven's lesbian harem???
Waiting for that Cory SSS Reaction to this!
We'll he did it again ladies and gentlemen can't wait to how to train your dragon next week
Does anyone have the link to the Meatcanyon x YTAlgorithm fanfic?  Asking for a friend…..
yuo*
Sent this to the one YouTube who loves Steven universe
No.. not Steven universe..
Jschlatt with ballsacks instead of his sideburns would fit him better. Idk why he doesn't shave off those hideous sideburns and finally let those balls grow on the sides of his face
God bless you sir for all the joy you bring ✅ your content always makes my day!
schlatt LMFAO
Steven universe the worst show ever made
Im going insane
Gold Buzzer right there!! You get to live in trending... For now <3 Thumbs up, this guy makes sick animations
Anything for Papa meat
Meat Canyon be working through his childhood truama through wonderful art
I can’t believe Steven Universe created a Reddit account!
god thank you for ending the steven universe one there. i really did not want to see the rest of that weird kinky fetishy shit
Meat canyon that’s for ruining all my favorite shows and YouTube channels  I’m being serious your wicked and twisted episodes are awesome keep up the good work
Just seduced the YouTube algorithm.
Thank you papa meat
Very meta. Very beautiful!
https://youtu.be/BrspN-bPhC8
so much spam.... great work MC love dem robots
NO YOU FUCKING WITH MY FAVORITE CARTOON! I LOVE IT!
This was literally and idea I had for video. But instead of the YouTube algorithm oh, it was a disgustingly overweight fan and was sexually abusing meatcanyon for not producing videos and meatcanyon had ptsd from it.
I dont like this
perfect.
youtup is the now the name
Bro. Wth did I just watch?
My favorite version of A neverending story. Just amazing.
Amazing!!😂😂
You cam hear his happiness in the laugh
Not even the YouTube algorithm can escape meatcanyon's sexual tension
Breaking the forth wall Nuce!
This was incredibly disturbing,  glad I subbed
oh god
And just like that, Meat was able to pull a reversal on the Youtube algorithm. HE was the daddy all along. XD
I’m gunna make your ass as bear as her head lol
Ho no🤣🤣🤣
Fucking beautiful
Yes Daddy !!
Now this is the third meatcanyon video I know of with a happy ending
Eyyyy
Ok, but I really like the design for the algorithm
Jesus christ, can you imagine how much it must have hurt climbing up the YouTube Algorithm Monster Machine Thing? I mean, LOOK AT IT. You touch one little piece of that thing and you'll have tetanus for life.
I THOUGHT STEVEN WAS SAFE MY WHYYY JUST WHYYY
This guy is awesome, definitely one of my favorite content creators!
What a crafty way of doubling your subscribers while doing the same thing...u sly bastard you...hehe
Babe wake up meat canyon uploaded
Poppa meat !!
Meatcanyon can fly?
what the fuck?! 😂🤣
I would murder everyone one of my family for meat canyon to make a among us video
breaking the 4th wall again are we?.... Mr. Meat.....
What the fuck is this shit
This is art
Nickoxado avacado is kinda looking a bit different but I can't put my finger on it 🤔
Holy crispety crunch! Look at the stretch marks on Steven, yo! Loved the Will Smith one, though.
Ah shiet what is happening-
meatcanyon is like adult swim but more disgusting
No. I had the Creamcrew, you left me. I don't trust you.
Que te fumas para hacer estos vídeos xddd
Bro those stretch marks
4 million people genuinely said "yes" to this
Steven universe
So what this channel is dead now?
A good representation of youtube's algo
Why.... why did youtube stop the spankings.... the Will Smith spankings must be continued I must know how it ends.
bro this is genius. i love your content it gets always better, the animation gets better... everyone subscribe to the second channel!
I have to be honest, for a moment I really belived he was going to fuck the youtube algorithm.
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
damn, these map.... back- background paintings? Whatever the technical term the environmental paintings are getting really impressive, especially the unique brush choices for the osacrs animation. I hope i can even reach a fraction of your skill one day....  i broke my ipad my artwork was to hard  to look at *sighs*.
the end reminded me of the movie never ending story
meat canyon really pulling out sexual tension before rule34 artists can, huh?
I just can’t stand all of the bots invading your comment section, wish there was something I could do about it.  Anyway, good luck getting to 5M on this channel, great video man!
You can't really make fun of Steven Universe without pissing off thousands of terminally online sexual degenerates.
meatcanyon man, i love ya and your art but dear god why poor steven
Steven Universe was already disgusting to me so this does nothing.
Can't stop rewatching the Will Smith part! 🤣
I say this will hitting Chris so what adding a spanking turned my world upside down
no...
Laughed out loud at the end.
clickbait
Thank you for consistently destroying my childhood i love it
That was wild and amazing at the same time
I am also glad you have to do this to survive MeatCanyon.. because I love you.. you weird glorious man that makes me think inappropriate thoughts and question my sexuality
Meat
This is beautiful. Just like you, Hunter.
Meatcanyon is a fuckin bard. He seduce charmed the YouTube centipede monster into accepting his terms
My expectations were subverted!
This is the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen. Well done meatcanyon
No, no NO NOT STEVEN UNIVERSE.
best vid yet
Already knew This one’s going to be a good one 😂😂
I like how meat can draw anything creepy and disturbing but yet he draws him self normal
i love Steven universe, but i hate this
tbh, riding on the back of that must be the worst pain a man could ever experience.
Why is your hand so shiny and wet? I don't want to take your hand. Let's just go. Love ya bro and love your work. Keep'em coming.
Lmao
Love both your channels man. Keep up the good work!
This is so relatable
The gem in bellybutton thing was always weird.
Why do we love these animations?
What the fuuu….
This is a masterpiece
uhh
Second Channel is gonna be my drag name
The only clickbait that I managed to finish.
How in the deep fried, extra crispy HELL did MeatCanyon turn an ad into something better than a random parody? You beautiful monster you!
Is steven Universes BIG BELLY on your 2nd channel?
Oh the power of friendship…
Frank Sinatra's "Balls in Yo Jaws" used to play at my uncle's house all the time when I was young!  I remember him picking me up in his van after t-ball practice, it was cool because it always had candy!  It reminds me of him. ...after his passing it turned out he wasn't actually related to me?  Take a listen. https://youtu.be/6snGN7-jCYw
I love how chill he is while being confronted by the Algorithm Monster, it’s like this is something he goes through on a weekly basis and he’s just done with it
never ending story
Steven stans screaming
I barely have any viewers and I know what you mean about having to sell out and chase trends. It’s a deep pain but then you compare it to being like a stock clerk at some store and you ask yourself “is this better? Is this freedom?”
Please pin this as your top video on your channel because this is something everyone who comes across your channel should see……
Nardwuar bro
Look how they massacred my boy.
Well at least we got 15 seconds of steven xDDDDDDDDDD
Damn, I was expecting Steven to eat Connie or to fuse/fuck with Perithot
Omg I love you meats making the algorithm a sentient being lol! You act draw and create. I just can't get over with ( I heard what you said) XD two seconds of video but great joke I really needed that cause never found will Smith scary before. Maybe that's why he struck Chris we all keep seeing the fresh prince.
Either I just smoked Crack or he just made this a thing.
Oh no...not Steven's Universe!!!!
Hello
Bro… wtf lol. Edit: Also, the whole YouTube algorithm fucking monster bot is too true man. It seriously sucks so much at times dude.
Already been watching em
Next sticker should be you riding YouTube algorithm
bro.. please dont do this
Wasn't expecting an advertisement for the second channel, but I'm not complaining, that is some top notch advertisement.
What can I say ? Man's a genius.
“ daddy did you wrong “ “ yeah🥺”
the gem in steven's universe belly always reminded me of these butt plugs that are shiny
God I love him
It's okay; we all suffer from writer's block sometimes. Most of us enjoy the content on the second channel anyway.
Fucking lovely man!!! I bouncing on over now!! GOd damn!
incredible video
Hi (●’◡’●)ﾉ
We need a Guga Eats video papa
Do one of ksi
Perfect Steven
Oh Meaty. What would we do without your sweet nourishing content. I require more.. Much more.
Okay, now that we got this, can someone on here talk why Steven Universe is hated
Yessir I already subbed to papa meat love that channel just as much as this one keep up the work and have fun while you do it my guy don't let this control you
comedic
Im.not watching this im.not watching this im.not watching this   Bro ily but stop
He a big clod
Dam we early
I love that the YT algorithm was a Wurmcoil Engine
Papa meat reminds me of Toadie from Neighbours... :D
It became self-aware
*Bro what*
Dam it  meat canyon, when will you quit killing my favorite shows. hahaha love your weird shit bro.
Lmao, that thin Rose in a background :D
i like how meat canyon has made people scared and sick cuz of its traumatising videos
I think he running out of ideas
Awesome
Can we please get more day drinkin episodes!?
Rolfmao 🤣
I love this, I hope you continue to pursue what you love
Dance monkey... dance.
It's 1:25am...  Great... now I'll never Sleep  Edit: YouTube man Sounded like Veigar
wait, this is the second channel and not the main one?
This was one of the shitty-ist ones I have ever seen
Finally! Took you long enough but we get to see your twisted version of Steven Universe
ye
This is disgusting "I require more"
No one has ever turned burn out into a more beautiful work of art than this.
meat canyon going from "yeah i fallback on sexual attention alot" to calling himself daddy and stroking the youtube algorithm funniest shit
Your amazing
MeatCanyon makes everything weird and freaky and I love it, gives you a different view on things lmfao 😂
Awesome video!
Surprised you haven't gone after phineas and ferb yet
I'm WEAK lmao
Damn that's a good way of promoting your second channel
I love you 💘
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates-🎈
Awe and here I was hoping for Steven universe
Genius b😂
Steven looks like Ron Jeremy
The stretch marks were marvelous
The laugh at the end me da años de vida
Is that Danny McBride or some thing
OH SHIT DISCORD MOD STEVEN UNIVERSE
Lmao this is gold
Oh heck nah, not my boy stevennn 😂😭 Edit: okay, i watch it and i can relate to this video somehow XDD
I don't know why. But i started laughing when they  went outside flying.
I was in tears😂😂
The quality in his videos amazes me each and every time
You should dye your hair orange please bro I beg
This is nice, keep it up👍🏽
damn
I love Meatcanyon’s second channel
THIS WAS THE GREATEST "papa meat plug" EVER! - SUSAN "the neglectful b*tch of youtube" WOJCICKI
You solved the problem by falling back on your method of making something sexual to beat the YouTube algorithm monster machine! Yay!
Was the YouTube monster a reference from the Nine movie
I can’t believe I’m disappointed that I didn’t leave this video absolutely disgusted
This had to be amusing for the people that didn't know about the second channel, it's probably one of the best ways to shout-out it  Compared to most YouTubers..
Bro has officially ruined every bit of the childhood im trying to hold on too💀
Nox made a video and he portrayed the youtube algorithm as a long metallic tentacle creature with a claw on the end of it too... something these youtubers seem to know that us regulars folk don't is what the algorithm really looks like. It must be like staring into the face of god. Those poor souls.
hes a genius
That will smith video woulda been god tier
well i already watch that channel so........OK!!!
Finally
Why cartoon-canyon have kanye west face
Well…hurry up algorithm…do your thing.
Ya, the youtube monster is a step too far, properly scary.
I love how you desplay yourself! your content is so great !
Thanks for killing my childhood cartoons in the most brutal and fucking cursed possible ways stay safe
man i loved this episode!
why are there so many spam bots
I genuinely thought i was gonna see pearl garnet and amethyst in this video:0
And the Jschlat part wa sfunny
That was better then anything else that invloved Steven Universe.
sweet! a never ending story refrence
welp, I definitely wasn't expecting this to happen, anyway I joined already :P
Pacman? Is a idea :)
😀
That's Oney playing the YouTube algorithm isn't it..
😁
The will Smith skit was hilarious!! And your speech has inspired me!! Keep going Meat!! Go!! Go make your horrifying thinks!! Ruin Our Childhood
This says alot about how the YouTube Agarithm will dominate over what YouTubers will soon post and will also soon battle it out with Vengeance to rule over the world.
JSchlatt and his Schlatt-sticles wasn’t something I thought I needed in my life…
22😃
0:48 , patreon team when the video is not here
Ah yes, Steven Universe. One of the most overhated series to exist.
Meat sensei, we shall follow your teachings
😃
😊
Papa Meat animated is the hottest thing I’ve ever witnessed.
😑
I will forever love that when I saw the thumbnail I said "Oh noo..." Oh yeah indeed.
😜
🤪
😙
That is 100% accurate
My favorite elidode Imlove of how the humor is pure humor moral of this comment epic episode 10/10
😃
Pov: the life of a YouTuber…
THIS WAS MY CHILDHOOD SHOW WHY WOULD U DO THIS WHYYY😭
😆
Early😭
Ye
The thumb nail 😂😂😂😂😂😂
😄
Crap, he discovered SU.
......
Lmao Kids Next Door
I'm disappointed he didn't finish the Will Smith gag lmao.
What a fuckin cop out video.
daddy Meat
i still wanted to see more of steven universe. hope u go back to that and make a full vid.
WTF HAPPEN?! STEVEN TURNED INTO A BALD PERSON WHEN HE ATE TO MUCH TACO BELL
No cap there was a guy in my high school who had those exact stretch marks and he wasn't even that fat
Jokes on you I already joined the second Chanel
Now i feel weird watching steven universe
Why did the youtube "yeah?" sound like Cody Ko? Lol
You could do “Logan Paul becomes overly obsessed with prime” kind of got the idea from Mike Majlak’s recent vlog with Lana in it and Logan just said, as a joke he’s replaced water with prime
He looks good in his own art style. 10/10
He got to Steven😭😭
Eww js eww
What's happening 😭😭😭
XDD
yeah
That Jschlatt one felt so real
I can already hear cancel culture coming.
someone once started yelling at me for being a dream stan bc i said schlatt's aggressiveness is kinda funny. and then they called me bigoted racist scum because i said i only watch some schlatt things because i found him through swagger.
Beef it’s what’s for dinner
NOOO, WHAT DID THEY DO TO MY BOI STEVIE!!!
It's not about Steven Universe, It's about story about a scary youtube algorithm machine worm and a man
What episode is this i don't remember🤔
🤪
Big boy gotta eat
YES, DADDY MEAT! YEEESSSS!
🙃
I love that i laughed with him at the end lol
oh god... not steven...
😙
You had me at figures, Father
😜
SUBSCRIBE THE SECOND CHANNEL
😃
“IM ABOUT TO MAKE YOUR ASS AS BARE AS HER HEEEAAAAD” I’m fucking dead
😃
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣
It looks like riding that thing would castrate you... Just like the real algorithm!
😆
I knew this day was coming😭😭😭😭
Oh wtf
Oh lawd he's coming
This man this godly man just gives
🙃
Wonderful piece to start my day with. Thank you.
*In an alternate world, his videos could be cannon*
I hope you are just kidding and you actually doing well on your mental health papa meat
😙
I’ve never watched Steven Universe, but now I need to.
High Art
that giggle at the end  XD
☺️
😄
MeatCanyon making animations on himself is already creative enough
😇
centipede algorithm is terrifying
John 3:16 King James Version 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
😀
*Daddy is with you babymeat...*
I’m surprised that you’ve turned yourself into an animated character
😃
YouTube: That’s too inappropriate.  Me: Most of his videos are inappropriate!
Dad bod there
Do super nanny next please
Meat canyon please, I love you but you can’t keep doing this to me.
This man is just very good at this and I’m happy that he’s having fun doing what he loves.
This is the best ad for a channel I've ever seen. I'm going to make a subscribe with a second account just because of how amazing this was
most relatable toon yet
😃
the "yeah" from youtube got me 😳
You don't ride the YouTube algorithm. The algorithm rides you.    It rides you until you have no creative energy or motivation left. Then it hops on the next hot fresh steed and rides it off into the sunset. Leaving you to slowly crawl on the barren ground in obscurity.
1:36 in a alternate universe this happens
You are getting so legit dude story lines getting thick 😂
I was abotta say wtf when I saw the thumbnail but now I'm thinking, this is the best video meatcanyon has ever made!
😄
Thats what i imagined too on how youtube algorithm would look like.
You can make one on the Amazing World of Gumball.
😄
I love the papa meat channel, I'm in a really stressful academic year and I watch his videos whenever I take a break. I hope it gets the recognition it deserves <3
NO WAY YOU KNOW THIS SHOW?! THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFEEEEEEE
😄
The “presence” of “jschlatt” in this YouTube “video” gives me “solace” in these “dark times.”
what the fu-
what
😄
Ahh yes Nicocado Universe...
YAAAAAA
fine, as long as you make *ALL* the Crystal Gems way creepier. I won't rest until the fan favorites lose their meaning
😄
Oh Gosh What did i just watch
Early yay what the fuck
Presentation and delivery reminds me of hotdiggitydemon combined with you’re normal stuff. I’m so in fucking love. If you go for more of this style when the idea put is empty, we will all enjoy it just as much dude! Love your vibe and style keep it up!
I genuinely thought this was the second channel for like 2 minutes.  The channel icons are so similar.
Um wow
I'm somehow just not phased anymore.
This is Steven when he becomes old and is a dad too
relatable
shet
I still find the actual Steven Universe show more disturbing than this…
lol literally laughed out loud this was great
This remind me the Boomer from Left 4 Dead
We love you papa. You're too big to fail. You have our support
Thank you this is fantastic
his back looks a little too spiky to sit on and take a nice joy ride to the sky
Yes just needs some dad fusion and a  rocker boi thrusting between them midrolls
This is the best advertisement I've ever seen
Nós somos um desenho gay,nós sempre fazemos gayzise
I knew the ending would be the ending and am glad it was.
MeatCanyon's style is both impressive and horrifying.
Why is the Algorithm Monster's body made of various shuriken?
Will Smith smacking Chris Rocks ass  LMFAO
Quick meat daddy, male a joke about CEO susan
Commenting to help your algorithm
I wanna see the power ranger but they act like the clock work orange guys
thick
Steven looks ok and all, but can we just talk about how MeatCanyon drew himself, Looks so Amazing! 👏 👏 👏
The Will Smith-Chris Rock thing was actually funny. To me at least.
Meatcanyon just had a writer's block.
You honestly need video ideas or is it rather the will to keep doing videos until you depart from your mortal coil?
monkaS
You're a GENIUS
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
....... ya no...
I was kinda excited for a SU parody
i’m gonna cry
Do a Pibby video lol
The cartoons are as horrifying as ever but the background for steven universe was actually gorgeous
ᵈᵃᵈᵈʸ ᶜʰᶦˡˡ
I figured if you ever did an SU vid that it'd be all the Gems forcing Steven to "fuse" with them like child rape to his displeasure while all the adults ignore his cries since all the Gems are attractive babes.
oh nah
MAKE SOMETHING ABOUT SPORE
Cool
MEAT 🍖 CANYON THE GOD
I'd love to see your take on badlands chugs turning into a kaiju with an unquenchable thirst
why you make urself look fat bro? ur not that big for ur size
I love how it got meta really quick. Also, I think this was an amazing way to advertise the second channel.
Ahm okay, let's go!
Haha those f***ing stech marks though hahahahah
HELP 🙄
Oh GODDD NO😭😭
I was hoping to see a glimpse of Dons Sly Cooper art on the wall:(
Daddy back from war 😎😜🤪
YT: You make it feel like odd, sexual tension MC: Ya, I tend to do that  *proceeds to fall back on odd, sexual tension*
I don’t know if this is a slight at the YouTube algorithm, a collection of ideas that couldn’t be fleshed out into full videos, or an advertisement for the Papa Meat channel but I’m all here for it either way.
The man responsible for ruining my childhood
Twerk.
That's weird I could a swore I already subbied to meat papa
love you man
Ha, he looks like an obese Ryan The Leader! No offense, Ryan The Leader!
Complimentary comment for the Youtube Algorithm Monster Thingy.
That damn YouTube algorithm monster. You can’t escape it!
You clearly enjoyed making this- honestly this is halerious ik I spelt it wrong but whatever-
Can you fill my belly up Papa Meat? *FILL ME WITH THOSE JUICES, PAPA MEAT.*😏😏🥵😵🥵🥵👿🥵😈🥵😈🥵🥵👿🥵🥵💀🥵💀😫🥵😩😏😩😤😣😖😏😖😏😏👿🥵🥵😫🥵😫😣😵😏😵😏😣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🥵😫🥵🥵😵😏😏😣😏😵😏😵😏😤😵😖😣😏*WƏ §ƏƏ ÂŁĽ.* 😣👿😵😏😵😏😖😣😣👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁😣👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁*WÈ ÃŘĔ WªŢĆHÏŅĞ.*👁👁👁👁💀💀💀💀💀💀👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁👁
That monster YouTube thingy makes me remember of that machine monster in 9.   Pls tell me you remember 9
NOOOO, NOT MY STEVEN 😭😭
OMG this is great.
The common Steven Univers fan i see
Lolololololololololololololol
This took a turn I never seen, but also Papa Meat is also a very good channel and I watch it quite often!<3
Ayo wtf man 😭😂
YouTube algorithm is actually terrifying
I'm about to eat but a new MeatCanyon video dropped... should I wait? of course not !! Let'S GOOOOOO
Refreshing
genius
Didn't the second channel already exist for a while tho?
0:17 I like the Meat-canyon as a cartoon character design
Very epic and based <3
This is the best advertisement I have ever watched
lovely
wow the animation looks cooler
Normie: how does it make you feel watching these weird videos   Subscriber: Euphoric
If this dissolves into something sexual I'm gonna cry edit: so so
This show is horrible
Iloveee meat canyon 💛
everything about this is amazing
I really want a short animation about the human feces in johnny depps bed in an old black and white noire style
Way to make me laugh with writer's block. Awesome!
freak OFF HAHA
waiting for this video
What we need is a Wall-E episode. Please meatcanyon, just let it happen.
I did not see this comming at all
I just adore every one of your oieces of art
Steven if he was a discord mod
Unbelievable.
i finished to this
W
What it do skedadudler
God bless dood lmao that last few parts im like WTF lol got me gigglin
I am utterly disturbed by this masterpiece
I used to be very into Steven universe when I was younger and didn’t realize that Steven universe was all lgbtq and that’s when I stopped watching
Way to go buddy!
Take your time with the content we aren’t going anywhere don’t let the you tube overlords crush your spirit
Meatcanyon has a weird, sort of wholesome vibe to him. Props to him for growing such a loyal fanbase!
Meat flirting with youtube has to be the sussyiest thing ever seen
Is that voice Dom from Flashgitz?
let’s fly meaty booyyy
No u fucking didnt WHY’D U DO HIM LIKE THAT WHY STEVEN 😭
Best spam Ive ever seen
this is a masterpiece
what theeee I love it its a master peice
It was fun while it last.
This was all a promotion for his second channel
huh
Real strong sexy men are already subscribed to the second channel! 🤫😎🤝💪
IM ALWAYS EATING WHEN YOU GET YOUR ANIMATIONS OUT WTH
One word for this sin channel.    Beautiful.
Your a legend and i love Your vids
1:26 💀💅
🖤🖤🖤
*“I’m glad I have to do this, to survive!!”*
...
"Pwease don't be mad at me."
Steven universe was a woke sjw cartoon designed to indoctrinate children.
You’re so fucking good at what you do, man. 😂😂
This 1 might be my new favorite lmaoo
I need more giant YouTube algorithm monster machine thing in my life.
It feels illegal to be this early to one of your videos
The most relateable video of Meatcanyon
Is it me or do you look like dj khaled with some sick flow
Why does he remind me of that one character from Overwatch?
Fly on my son, feast upon these likes and live another glorious day!
thank god the video changed topic so quickly, I wasn't ready for whatever was going to happen with steven
jschlatt has been blessed with MeatCanyons corrupted touch!
Welcome to another episode of why is this in my recommendation
Gotta love the constant feeling of being eye raped
STEVNEN MY BELOVED. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :sob:
Breaking the 4th wall here I love it
You had writers block and smashed through it like a god conquering himself.
Papa Meat is fuckin the Youtube algorithm, isn't he? He giving it to it, hard
Still think that gem fusion in Steven Universe would be an interesting and fucked up Idea for Meatcanyon cartoon.
Glad you and the YT algorithm got along in the end
This is one of the best
Prefer this over actual steven universe.
Fantastic
NOOOO, GREAT. NOW I'M SCARRED FOR LIFE AGAIN
I want to see them do Shrek next
man what is going on
YouTube's design reminds me of that one machine from 9. Terrifying. If you know you know
i like how he managed to morph a steven universe episode into will smith slap and into a shameless plug
Why'd you make it to look like you , Papa?
Thanks for ruining my child hood 😂😂😂
This is amazingly disgusting
So this is how he promotes his second channel. I love it!
The reboot looks so amazing.
I just started my Steven universe rewatch come on man 😭
If he is running out of ideas, he should do Cailou
The way he drew schlatt LMAOOOO
great video, what do you think about steven universe the main character, how is your mental state..
He really had us good
lol wtf just happened
Nickacodo’s successor
I joined the adventure
The will Smith part. Best thing ever.
Meatcanyon better end up on the 2022 rewind
I love you Daddy Hancock! Lmao
so good
Dang the YouTube algorithm is really on point here
I wonder how jschlatt will react when he sees this 0:36
Great promotion video for your second channel!
Daddies here, Daddies got you!
I appreciate how after Hunter is called out for all the sexual tension, he immediately starts talking to the YT algorithm monster to start more sexual tension.
Those sideburns are awesome.
What about The Amazing World Of Gumball? You haven't done a video on that yet
What a wonderful interpretation of Susan.  I love how he rides her into the sky like Falkor lmao I love how meta this is.
looks like me when I was 300lbs
GOOD BOYYYYYYY
Meatcanyon always disturbs me, yet amazes me at the same time  its awesome lmao
I came for Jawbreakers, I followed and stayed to watch Papa Meat have fun.
You’re healing the world with comedy! Making a literal difference - metaphorically
Friendship  the real power
HUNTER YOU ARE TRAPPED INSIDE YOUR ANIMATION WAKE UP WAAAAAAAAAAAAKE UP
This is fucking fantastic. I'm already subbed to the new channel also
The greatest plug ever.
*Swap It out with CreamBeliver's version of Steven Instead*
Lmao i loved this one
You really do fall back on sexual tension alot
Lmao steven has those dark stretch marks seen in people with hypercortisol.
Our papa is going to give his meat flute to the Youtube Algorithm Monster proud as always 🥲
He talked to the YouTube algorithm like it was the car in 8 Crazy nights when Sandler was fucking it goodnight lol
The steven universe part reminded me of the show Clarence
Meat daddy
I wanted a steven universe episode so bad 😭😭😭😭
This is the best representation of the algorithm ever created lmao
Remake catdog. That would be crazy cool
Jschlatt needs to see this lmaooo
Why does he have stretch marks?
When’s the collab with psychicpebbles? Zach Hadel
Master and Servant...  But who serves who?  And who masters...ba...nah.
This was fucking brilliant.
Steven universe songs slap tbh
Papa meat never disappoints
His mullet is even more magnificent.
why
bro one time I had a nightmare
Somehow this makes steven universe actually watchable
DO A BADLANDS CHUGS CARTOON
so sad that this channel ratios the other one so hard D:
I'm astounded by all that beard movement—the whole animation is Quality but holy hell
please continue making anakin parodies
QUIIICKLYYYYY
god...
why...just why
Ok, unironically, the design of Evil YouTube Algorithm is genuinely awesome and kind of intimidating!
NOOO NOT STEVEN UNIVERSE PLEASEE
this is great disney can suck a lemon
I'm kind of disappointed that this wasn't a Steven Universe episode
🐽🐽🐽🐽
Wth i was just watching you rn
Meow
Funny
Curious was this one monitized
I'm glad I have to do this to survive !
We all must feed the algorithm eventually.  Working for Susan is like cock and ball torture but without the cock and ball part
so accurate to the original design. I was hoping Stephen would look a little different.
Holy sht this guy got talent even to show a meta sponsor of him. Autolike
stop.
😂😂
Man I hope you never stop making quality content like this ma nigga
Even the rejected ideas are absolute bangers. Susan would be proud :,)
If your looking for new parodies, Parody Cars, Mickey Mouse, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Avengers, Pokémon, Batman, Ghostbusters, Sonic the Hedgehog, Wizard of Oz, Bob’s Burgers, Nintendo, Mario, Pac Man, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tom and Jerry, Dr Seuss and Heck, I’ll keep naming more for ya.
this is being taken down for the nutsacks
so true
This video was great
I love this man
My ex used to be obsessed with this show Taylor I hope you see this and it ruins your day 🤣
👁👄👁 Whaaaaa...??m
Please dont be mad at me ☹
i looked up airsoft and this came up,
The sexual tension dark humour just never gets old. God bless you MeatCanyon...
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Mmmmm Vanilla wafers
8
Was not expecting that. Then I wasn't expecting that again.
😘😘😘
The belly is the universe in Stevens last name, how was I so blind
Could you do *Mona the Vampire* , please? That girl is clearly on acid, thinking what she's seeing is real.
this is my favorite video yet
The genuine laugh at the end that was equal parts pain and complacent amusement was golden
WE HAVE THE MEAT!😬
Balzz
DO MARIO
man u should do gumball, the show itself can be extremely cursed sometimes
Will Smith 😏😏🤣
Uk wat idc wat ppl say this is accurate let the kids hate
Good vid and I'm already subbed to papa meat
Funny story I clicked on this from the other channel
I'll be honest I did not see that coming with the whole YouTube algorithm monster, gotta say I'm loving it lol
Holy shit this is hilarious
This is the reason I’m still alive .
GLORIUUS
A second channel where you draw weird shit and do other stuff sounds very nice.😺
A masterpiece from start to finish
I dunno, that Jschlatt nutsack sideburn video could be a banger.
If there's no sexual tension on a Meatcanyon video then it's not a Meatcanyon video 😏
MOIST
But uh, you're gonna finish the Steven Universe one though right?
You baited us!
This.... was funny as all hell holy moly
Papa was cuter in the other video. You should do what Lee does https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYx5zJ_N6Ug
bro I love this
krazy
How come MC butt didnt hurt while riding YT The best question
Lol
I love you big boi
I like how it changes the whole video after a good 20 seconds. I was prepared to be grossed out but now I’m just laughing
"All I want to do is see you turn into a giant woman"
This video took so many frickin turns what happened
This is the best promotion for a second channel ive seen.
I SHALL JOIN YOU!!!!
Hi meatcanyon
Damnit I knew he'd come for Steven Universe eventually . It just happend sooner than I thought
is it just me, or is wild kratts good meat canyon material
when did meat get 4.3 million subscribers lol
"daddy's here, daddy's got you" mmm
It’s scary the power that the Meat Man has to turn any wholesome cartoon character into grotesque creatures. It’s pretty impressive to be honest
Mettacanyon
That laugh at the end
Kinda wish he followed through with the whole Steven Universe thing rather than just divert the plot of the video into something different
I actually really like the second channel
🖤
2:53 you sold me on the lewd anime statue part. I think I'm already subscribe to your channel.
If there is spikes coming out the YouTube algorithm’s back, then where is he... sitting on?
Got to love the never-ending story reference
Oooh nooo, not my son Steven. 🤣 🤣 I would love to see one about the Chuck E Cheese from each decade (Chuck E multiverse?) or recently divorced alcoholic 1977 Chuck E Cheese. Go crazy with this idea just make it dark af 😆
This was a masterpiece. Well done, sir.
i am bumbo
You know. This video gave me a whole different view on what YouTube is really like. Although I'm not gonna start the topic of it here :D
TWO FOR FIVE
I didn’t expect a Neverending Story parody in the end. This is the best promo for a second YouTube channel I’ve ever seen in my life.
Already joined, also like the idea that YouTube algorithm is a giant mechanical worm that consumes all content.
help
I knew you were going to touch this mfer eventually. Just had to ruin it for me
The never ending story reference made me so happy
Made Steve universe meatcanyon
2:13 Yeah~ vs Yeah.
bro why
Either this is the happiest cartoon meats ever made or I’ve been so desensitised by all the nightmare fuel meat has produced in the past that this feels a new sensation
Part of me was waiting for a voice Crack to break into crying during the "...to survive!!!!!"
GANG
With the amount of awareness this man has, it would’ve been impossible for him to not turn out a great entertainer.
Yooo, this wasn't what I expected, but I'm not mad about it! Though it would've been kinda funny to see how you'd massacre Steven Universe
some of these commenters didnt even watch the video yet
Hi
3:09 I can’t imagine how painful it is riding on the razor sharp back of the YouTube algorithm
that just looks like nick son thats not steven u hurting my eyes
I love how everyone assumed this was going to be some abomination cartoon with Steven Universe, and then got blindsided by an Ad for his second channel. Fucking love you Meat.
This being an elaborate ad for your second channel was quite the twist
I didn’t know Otto Octavius told meat canyon to make animations
what the fuck
Imagine if Meatcanyon make a hent*i with this artstyle
So this is how Steven looks now.....damn depression hit him harder than a truck crash
He had to feel those spikes in his ass
DADDYS HERE
I wouldn’t be surprised if he didn’t do something Pibby related.
ga dam
Honestly this accurately represents todays social climate
Too real 😅
Looking like the boomer from left 4 dead
You should have had Susan Wokokijiji in the background looking like the demon she is
WHY DOES STEVEN UNIVERSE LOOK LIKE ME LMAO
I love how he's disgusted with his animations but still continues
Fourth wall thoroughly shattered in classic MeatCanyon fashion
We get a vid for everything, even “creativity blocks” (que YouTube algorithm Monster Machine thing) Thank you, Papa Meat 🥩 We don’t deserve u 🙏🏾
Watching meatcanyon solve his relationship problems with youtube is really... nice.
Another beautiful art piece
that steven looked like NIkocado
When that channel appears in my algorithm i shall take a chance on your second youtube channel.
I saw a comments 666
I love this dude's content
The sky at the end was very beautiful. That is my takeaway from this video
I am pissed that I forgot to sub to his second channel yet I am always seeing his videos there.
Mr.Youtube-Algorithm-Monster-Machine-Thing really pushing it.
OH NO, not the YouTube algorithm!!
Did he twist amazing world of gumball yet?
Yeah woo fuck yea bring it on daddy
super cute
now animate yourself having sexual tension with the robotic youtube algorithm monster
Kimpossible or Danny phantom would be funny
Please don't put a gun in your mouth 🥺
Okay but I want YouTube algorithim monster machine lookin' thing as my pet
I HATE THIS CRINGY ASS NAME I MADE WHEN I WAS 12
Big man Schlagg looks good
lol
I SHALL JOIN FATHER!
NUTSACK SCHLATT
So Papa has a metal spike up his ass while riding on the algorithm machine.
He got Steven Universe too I never thought I would see this day
What have I watched
I feel like their was some odd sexual tension between him and that YouTube algorithm monster machine thing.
Oh no
how did he manage to make it look like his actual self
очередной шедевр
....😭😢  This is awesome!!!!!😭😭😭
оставлю комментарий на будущее
Very based, very redpilled
Early🕶️
Sheeeesh
MeatCanyon is the OG of my childhood
Oh my god
Lmao Mr YouTube algorithm monster 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can only imagine how annoying it was for you to draw all those lines in your beard every frame 🥴
MeatDaddy's here!
love u
*this is fine satire* *very exquisite*
ah
MeatCanyon is the OG of my childhood
So if u start a YouTube but don't meet a quota will that big ass monster pop up
Whatever keeps bringing quality content from you, I fully support you.

Make a sonic one, I feel like it has some potential
The smurfs but they are a cannibal tribe 🎺🦕

Jajajajajajjajajajajajajjaajajjajjajaja
I'm finally early on one of papa meats videos
This is a creative way to promote your second channel.
I jumped but didn't fly with you...I didn't fly...
Excited by the thumbnail, more impressed with a meta toon of MeatCanyon’s constant battle against the YouTube algorithm. Definitely recommend the Papa Meat channel for those wanting some more juicy content👍
Never ending story
that laugh at the end
"Meat canyon" Sounds like another word for vagina
NO  NOT STEVEN UNIVERSE 🤣  YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME! NOOOOOO- Okay we’re good lol
It's sad to see how creators are just forced to make videos for money and if it's slightly mediocre then 5 months of work is useless
The man who keeps improving childhood cartoons.
Damn im early
WHAT IS THIS
every one have a nice day ;)
This shit will never get old
I love your videos!
Amazing
This video basically represents what he has to do otherwise yt algorithm will hunt him down

“fourth wall break inside of a forth wall break, that’s like sixteen walls.” -ryan reynolds
I love MEAT
Oh god the stomach veins
Bruh
Omg i love this 😘❤😄
how do u even think of just exaggerated details
This man's animation never disappoint us and of course Steven sould of think that and YOUTUBE love the design and I definitely did sub to your second channel bruh
Woah pops is in this one. Hell yeah.
You should make a coloring book of your vast art work and cartoon
No😩
Damn shit was wild.👀
Frankly I dont care about appeasing YouTube and giving them what they want.  I just... Do my own thing cause it's what I want to do.
omg
rick and morty interdimensional cable be like
…
Now that i think about it Will Smith slapping Chris would make a really good cartoon
And then they came for Steven.
Oh God here we go again...
🕺
Lmfao is this about the YouTube algorithm or the fans
this made me uncomfortable for the first few seconds
Woah pops is in this one. Hell yeah.
I’ve been waiting for this moment
The b@lls@cks on his cheeks 🤣
Bozo
This time WERE the Monsters
Stevens head is every pedophile combined.
How already 462 comments? :0
This is amazing holy shit
I'm having nightmares because of you. The Burger king guy and Chick-fil-A cow keep milking me and stroking my hair calling me a good boy
why is Chris rock so thicc…
Lost episode of Steven universe.
LoL xD I love the animation
Notice me
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This kept me balling
i thought we was boutta get a Steven universe vid
Um...nice
this hurts me
I love how this video only focuses on Steven Universe and his big belly for 30 seconds
Noice
“Too inappropriate” 😂
Let's see what childhood memories this will destroy
So early so good
2 minutes in uwu
Mess yourself??
ALL HAIL TO THE YOUTUBE ALGORITHM 🙌🏾
O no, not big bad youtube
I never been more uncomfortable and disgusted with Steven ☠
The Will Smith part was perfect
Meat Canyon keeps on making our childhood worse and worse in the best posible way
No…..why😭😭😭
Already knew it woulda been a fake out :D
this is wonderful
ahh
Love it , lol xDD
thank you
Love it
early
OMFG
I love it
wtf
Jschlatt clip is fucking hilarious!!!
This is such an amazing video. Great animation, and a very important message.
Thank you, Mr Pringle.
Bro what
Something tells me I'm gonna see something gnarly in this just from the Thumbnail    (Edit) oh, nvm
No. No, this can't be happening.  All those years, I have never thought. All those references, all those childhood breakers. None of them affected me. I never thought MeatCanyon ever would.  But alas, I have been slain, and shall join the never ending pit of all the people with a shattered *pun intended* soul from your hands.  Keep up the good work I loved it
Wth mc  just stop  ruining steven universe
I feel like MeatCanyon even questions what he makes nowadays and fears it sometimes
Meatcanyon is tired yet he makes videos, thank you
Seems pretty accurate.
bruh
What a great video to start the day with.
Your beard is animated really well
YESSSSS DAAAAADDDDDDYYYY
Great animation
How dare he to put ships ahoy soo low
Nice
Nice🫠
Why

You did not have to do “schlatt” like that
I like how he makes the YouTube algorithm a fucking death machine
