Thank You so much Suuuuuuuuuuuu for all the magic performances that you have given all throughout your 2 parts Manchester United carrier ✨️🔥⚽️❤️👍 From winning the premier league to winning UCL to scoring some wonderful freekicks ....You have done it all 🙌  But still I felt like You shouldn't have told those bad words that day in your interview with Piers Morgan about some of your teammates,Erik Ten Hag and gym facilties....if You have problem then why you comeback to such club you should have gone to somewhere else maybe to Sporting Lisbon from where it all started for You...anyway I think You should go to Sporting Lisbon now just like Suarez played in Nacional and helped them win a 🏆 I think you should go back to your roots and maybe help them to win a 🏆 after what happens in this world cup with Portugal in January transfer window if offer arrives from there....cause no other club wants You PSG,CHELSEA,NEW CASTLE already rejected You maybe REAL MADRID can bring you back for all the glory you have done for the club who can say about Papa perez ✨️⚽️🔥🙌....anyway let's see where You go 👀🤔⚽️
We will badly miss u Ronaldo 🙏
Mana CR7
Watching this after Ronaldo's contract got terminated. A club legend he'll always be❤️

WHERE'S THE RONALDO CELEBRATION?!??!??!!!??
Hello Manchester United Club Manager I really want Team Man Utd Tour to Indonesia I want to see my idols Cristiano Ronaldo Antony And Casemiro And De Gea
Ronaldo
look at bruno fernandes.. applauding rashford for the delivery .. thats captain 1:09
To Ten Hag. ... There a way to win earlier in every single match. ... Ronaldo must starting the game. Ask Ronaldo to shoot enemies' keeper as as hard as he can. His angel tunder shot! Targeting the keeper. Only the keeper, body, face hand , anyparts. ( Goal is just a bonus then for him) .. Guess if keeper got three times hard shot. The rest game must be  united's easely ... Professor TS.  MU minded!
🎊
THE GOAT 🐐😎 700 GOALS RONALDO 38 YEARS 😓 KİNG❤
I'm a United fan I love this Club' I really really like it keep fighting don't give up red devil😁😁💪
we need someone like kevin de bruyne.. beautiful pass.. Bruno is not at the level i guess.. he was.. but he is not..
Wow that celebration of Antony and Ronaldo
actually football is beautiful, but not for my country 🥺 🇮🇩
De Gea he is not worthy 1st goalie anymore. That first goal easy save
Suuuuuii
🔥🔥🔥
Main🔥🔥🔥 YouTube 🔥🔥🔥 per hun 🔥🔥🔥mere channel 🔥🔥🔥se aapka 🔥🔥🔥 help ho sakta hai 🔥
Siiiiii
ronaldo need passing
Смотрю из за Роналду МЮ, а его хуй выпускают играть
I like facundo pellistri ❤️❤️ kamback full time 🙏
The Don Ronaldo remain the king of this game and the king of soccer no matter what they say about him ❤👑 ❤
RONALDO the King *
viva Ronaldo!!
Thats why he's the world best Christiano Ronaldo
🙏🖤🖤🖤🙏
Ronaldo 🔥🔥❤️❤️💪💪
This VAR was created to check hanballs now????
Ge gea, what a player!! What To say about cr7, just a legend
It should be 3-1 .. VAR is useless and not worth helping referee to do more goods in football..
Ten hag really knows how to manage. He has kept on repeating that you can't miss pre-season. That is a a manager who knows what he wants. I respect how he has managed Ronaldo issue with respect + confidence. No one even miss the guys who have left..🤝
esse é feio 0:16 yha
De gea deserves the credit he needs
I actually cried when CR7 score.. its so nice and heartwarming
cr7 is back to the game suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii cr7 biggest fan
I have no clue, why the 1:3 has been disallowed. There´s no hands from Rashford. And even if. He´s already in a fluid move, so he can´t change his arms.
Haaland the Viking - 'nuff said
Antony run though 👍
Ronaldo well done
I’m sure I’m not the only one, but yet another poor ref decision. Clearly they do not see that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove your arms, hands out of the way in close proximity to the ball. Crazy.
Ten Hag must just stop his arrogance, what's the purpose of keeping CR7 on bench for so long, he's is a goal scorer, I was frustrated especially on the Manchester derby, I'm a Messi fan but Ten Hag must put his personal issues with CR7 aside if he want to win, they might sack him because of CR7
cool
JORDAN PICKFORD AS DE GEA SUCCESSOR NO THANKS. HIS DISTRIBUTION IS WORSE THAN DE GEA"S.
Anyway Messi better
Respect from Algéria 🇩🇿❤️🇩🇿❤️🇩🇿❤️🇩🇿
Siuuuuu
So,  Casemiro retrieved the ball from Iwobi for the assist to CR700.. Nice 😊
Ronaldo is still dangerous
If United got the ball to Ronaldo like City does with Haaland, we’d be top of table!!!!!
Glazers out!
Slmat sore,smkin cemerlang iku Ronaldo karirnya ugo om  lampard  smkin banyak  transferan uang masuk di rekening banknya,mf canda,hahahahaha,,,,,andai ronaldo ugo om lampard dtng pariwisata ke negara Indonesia aplgi ke kota Jawa timur......ya mungkin dapat tawaran olahraga/cari keringat tpi dapat uang buat maen di klub sepak bola di klub Persebaya trmsuk Cortes yg pindah ke klub laen.....mosok ke kota Jakarta dktin n menyapa Megawati / SBY ya ?????

That Rashford goal was absolutely 100% fair, comparing to Michail Antonios goal on WHU vs Fulham..
Antony perlu membuktikan lagi dia sebagai pengganti luiz nani 👍
Ronaldo na legend

I searched up how many goals Ronaldo has scored and it said 700
Cristiano Ronaldo  😍😍😍
💪
So a chin is equal to hands now
Epl is one of the best league in the world  but it has one of the worst referees in the world
Highlights video only win, if lose never upload 😂😂
I hv not seen it in other big5 channels, except MU. Lose is lose, what a shame not post all the lose matches in MU channel. Haha😂 just MU can do this thing
All Losing matches why not posted? 😅 funny channel😂
I cant believe Martial or Rashford start over CR7, not united or cr7 fan but united is always entertaining as entertain as watching circus lol New manager, same old story, same joke, same disappointment..
No record for losing matches😂 i cannot see it in other channels of other teams
Only accept all winning games? So funny, Manchester United😂
It is so funny for this channel, where is the losing match with MC 3:6?
Less goals than salah. Finished player
Really like the mentality of the players brought in by ETH.
Cr7
Hopes this goal can lift his spirit after this match
VAR is a discrace
CR700
Rashford was robbed off his goal, what a disgrace of a referee
Should have NEVER sold Garner, not for 9 million
Coach is not happy about Ronaldo goal
Viva Ronaldo
But Manchester united is disrespecting to Ronaldo it's not acceptable
never gonna forget this moment when Ronaldo completed his 700 goals on my birthday ❤️
That Garner's shot was ....🔥 United made a mistake by selling him man that for 9 mill.
Yeah, finally Ronaldo score a goal again.. Great come back from Manchester United..
Only casemiro know how to pass to cr7
700 🐐
The best sprint antony
Cr700
This is how man United will soon beat Chelsea 💪
I'm very happy because Harry Maguire not playing 🥳🥳🥳
How is that a handball?

Ronaldo if he score he'll scored a winning goal😚
I just don't understand why Rashford goal was disallowed...
Ronaldo will regain his confidence, and show once again who’s the greatest
Yo conte tres ??? Jajajaja
Ronaldo is back
Where's bruno
700 is an outrageous number.😮
Ronaldo getting into groove that's what red devils needs 🤘
King👑 football⚽
Ronaldo wasn't out of form, he was out of luck and proper game time. Let the luck be on his side and also game time, he can still produce 20+ goals this season!
casemiro give learning to MU how to use Goat Ronaldo, with simpel cross

Pecah telor
Lindelof is a reliable backup, Shaw is back doing what Shaw does especially when he has competition. Dalot is being overplayed and he’s been lackluster the last couple of games. We need Gusto or Vanderson in January badly to provide competition for him to avoid complacency. I think we’d sign two players in January. A right back and a forward. I’m calling Vanderson and Gakpo.
How the hell Rashford's goal got disallowed?
🐐🐐🐐
AAA video please???
CR700🥳
Combaeck
Madrid vibes case ronny😍
Casemiro really know how to pass to Ronaldo, Their togetherness at Madrid can't be a lie
Comandante....eres el mejor de la historia😎
It looks perfect if CR7 false nine becomes a winger, and Rashford plays winger as player number 9.
Legend no.7.
SIUUUUUU
Ronaldo como goleador hoy es imbatible, mortal, el mejor!

Rashford amazing skills 👏🏻
Brilliant pass by Casemiro.
Please upload extended highlights too.
congratulations to Manchester United for this victory Thanks to Ronaldo and Anthony for these goals👏👏❤️🤍
If Scamacca goal stood against Fulham then Rashy's goal should stand too.. Can someone please explain why there's a difference of opinion with VAR in 2 games..
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Enfin un but très attendu et Bravo de ne pas laisser tomber... 👍💪💪💯😍
From now forward your goal luck has opened.
Imagine if they missed out 3 points because of Garner assist. 😅
A clean shoot like that with the weak foot is pure beauty ✨

Wish we can see the casemiro and ronaldo connection from all angle.

Who is Ca Say Miro?
cristiano penaldo is finished
Ronaldo has 800+ goals no?
Congrats for "him".
Just play Ronaldo and casemero Manchester united will win all match

The coldest celebration ever seen in a football game. Ronaldo x Antony
Next Game, Casemiro & Ronaldo will sit on the bench again
finally CR7 scores his first goal of the season 🤩
G.A.T Ronaldo siiiiiuuuuuu
De Gea MOTM
Rashford pure goal...but the stupid referee and rubbish var rob him
Did I miss it or something ? Why was Rashford goal disallowed? The reply didn’t show it hit his arm
What a number  Now i can finally say suiiii
Every time Ronnie scores, it's an important goal. And still you don't sub him into the derby.. ETH?
The goat is back 🐐💯✌️
Cristiano Ronaldo el mejor sin duda 👍👍👍✌️💪
Ronaldo the best legend
مبروك كريستيانو لإنك تستحق وصلت 700 عقبال 1000 أناأشجع برشلونة كنت أكرهك لاعبا وأحبك إنسانا لم أفضل عليك أي لاعب يوما فأنت مثال للإصرار وقوة الإرادة والتحدي أتمنى منك عدم الإعتزال فأنت أيقونةكرة القدم
Pelatihnya gak bermutu pcat saja...... Slma jd platih gk seru lg liat mu..... Ronaldo cesimero cadangan pmain abal abal dmsukin ea hncurlh mu
CR 7 shows tenhag . CR 7 is the boss
CR7 LOVERS. 👍
Why didn't this team play the Manchester Derby?
finally,cr7 scores!!!
I dont understand.. Why ETH never put Ronaldo as a starter ?... Even when United against City.. Ronaldo not play at all... that was a fool decision..
CR7 😱
Shocking decision on Rashfords goal,scrap v.a.r its ruining football
Liverpool > Manchester $ity and Manchester shitnited
Seriously? You have video assistance and still call that a hand ball? Corrupt bullshit sport.
Anthony was great, while Ronaldo was easy
C7❤️❤️❤️
VAR has no use in the league anymore, yesterday Arsenal penalty was not a penalty, even in the first half Liverpool had one that was denied 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️. Now Rashford‼️‼️‼️ those in charge of VAR should find another job honestly
Absolutely not a handball 😡
Ggmu
You can do better
Suiii
CR7 have two successor in both ManU and RM.  In ManU 👉 Antony  In RM 👉 Vini Jr
♥️♥️🙏🙏
Love it, we move
Great win.
Bg to wasit
One does not simply not show Ronaldo's celebration.
sorry for the previous commentator but this one commentator is better, he has the voice to do it not like the previous ok he's a United fan but not the commentator

THE GOAT of the game is back 🐐🔥👑
Casemiro made a mistake pass then get up and make a great clean tackle, then make an assists to Ronaldo. That was class player do. Unlike Fred, he lost the ball and walk XD
Penaldo
If this was handball then barca should have gotten a penalty, vs inter
HIA AE
CR700, SIMPLY GOAT! 👍

brilliant goal by Everton player.
Super tikitaka

CR7
From west java Indonesia support full Man.Utd 🔴 🔥
I really don't understand the handball rule. It's like the rules change every game and it's really starting to exasperate me. Rashford's goal 100℅ should've been allowed.
Mau nanya lord main g ya?
MAN U really needs to sort out the aerial duels.
Congrats Ronaldo 700th ⚽. 👍Win! Anthony is in great form. 👍 Remarkable, he did more in 4 matches, than Di Maria and Falcao have done in 1,5 years spell.
Chapter is not over yet 💥
The ref was not fair to drop rashfords goal 😥😥
Everton deserved at least a point.
I still get astonished with england referees..i didnt see any reason for rsshford goal to be dissallowed..very poor decision and unfairly decision from an england referee against united..because that was a significant goal for them to kill the game and they deserved it
𝐅𝐎𝐑𝐙𝐀 𝐌𝐈𝐋𝐀𝐍🔴⚫
It's should have been 3-1 Rashford goal should have stood. Considering how well United played if it had been a 2-2 draw it would have been worse.
A new duo arises cr7 and casemiro
Am wondering why rash's goal didn't stand
SIIIIIUUUUUU
The best player on the world is CRISTIANO💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
For all the Bruno n Eriksen it's Casemero to assist CR700
sounds like "caseymiro"
Ronaldo belum selesai
Well played CR7👏👏👏
เป็นกำลังใจให้ทีมแมนยูและดีใจด้วยที่เก็บ3แต้มได้ครับโด้นายสุดยอด
Cristiano 🤩🤩🤩🐐
Well done Marcus definitely a goal use the disappointment to go get 20 prem league goals for utd GGMU

They released the Giant..!!
How was Rashford's goal disallowed? The Handball rule keeps getting ridiculous

What a pace for 37 years old 😱😱
Itu Rashford Handball?
Well deserve for Ronaldo ,his the greatest goat in history🐐
When Ronaldo play he scored, doing what Ronaldo does
But rashford goal was correct 💯
Cr7 🐐❤

Brilliant all round performance from the boys, rashfords goal should defo stood, VAR is killing this beautiful game
Again CR7 was there to save man utd...
If Everton manage to level up last night, i will never watch the EPL until they remove VAR from Football.. But at least we win, let it be .
Absolute disgrace of referee decision Rashford robbed of his goal
Cr7 legend 😍 back to siiiiiiiuuuu
Cr7 goal was not an easy to convert.. He is the best ever.
The goat🐐🐐🐐🐐
WIN : REPLAY HIGHLIGHT LOSE : NO REPLAY HIGHLIGHT
Rashford goal and That Everton first goal was disgusting.. Rashy goal should be allowed and It should be a foul from Everton leading up to the first goal..
Rashford is a monster
Casemiro is class❤️
Antony is the best in man united
Just wanted to give praise to the team and manager and staff, on a great performance. You work hard and put the work in and the praise comes... well done to everyone
I don'n think Rashford handballed
Siuuuuuuu ronaldo
how tf is that a handball?? LMAO...
Wow the run from Antony man got speed
CR 7 best in the world 🌎
Newcastle next we need to win that game..... Antony to score again
Casemiro will become even more better
VIVA RONALDO
Ronaldo & Antony celebration after CR700 🐐 scored is pure class
Antony making history already
CR7 not finished he needs more playing time plus players who knows how to assist him that's all.. imagine if he was playing for city.. he'd be having 20 goals by now..
1:17 Case : gotcha!
Ah best midfield in world Erikson Bruno Casemiro just fantastic
YESSSSSSS! SIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
ronaldo best footballer ever
Y'all should really look at Rashford! Please look at Rashford!! He's a baller!
I like casemiro and ronaldo combo they should have always start together .and they r besties.and the one i know is that casemiro is never jealous of Ronaldo
Congratulations to CR7 for his 700th Club Career Goal! Siuuuuuu!
need to be 777
Martial starts his 1st game and pulls a martial,😂😂 classy dude
Crista Ronaldo Sewy Is Back❤🎉
Saved by the whistle. This useless Man useless always survive by whisker.
I want to say this again and again until you guys hire somebody; but Manchester United has the worst YouTube/Social Media game of any team in the Prem. Just got off a the Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs pages. Miles off it. Please can we get some fun content man.
雰囲気良くて最高👍
RONALDO IS NEVER THE PROBLEM. NEVER.
It sucks to see cr7 not being used
The Goat is back 🤫👏🏾
Cr7💪🏾
Siuuuuuu
Siuuuu is back🔥
CR7🐐
United had to win this one
More respect to Anthony's left foot🔥
It's a shame and absolutely pathetic that you did not upload the highlights for the Manchester Derby. At least be gracious in loss.
Ronaldo is the best
This stunning left footer from Ronaldo will give pain to a certain fan base. Form is temporary but class is permanent. CR700
Love Manchester United. Hope they win pl
1:54 Might as well get rid of VAR if their decisions around it is shrewd and please play Casemiro more. Truly that assist from him for Ronaldo is soooo beautiful!
Livin the dream... thank you all. So glad to see Christiano playing and 700 goals = phenomenal. David - fine save. Pleased for you all.
Closest thing we've seen to Erik's style of football all season. Hope we keep it up.
CR700
Goattt CR7

Cr7 just need mor playing time
Give it to Bruno next time Rashy
Man United big up
CR700🐐

Suiiiiiiiiiii
congrats CR7!!
Rushfords goal was disallowed because he's black
Ronaldo should play in every single match because he’s the key of chance for winning All team ❤ respect 🫡 for Ronaldo
Casemiro should be given credit for what he did, the man controlled the midfield, creating chance
If Manchester United scout Son...Manchester United will be upgraded
Manchester united
CR7😍
SEWY
When Ronaldo score, everyone is happy.
Rashford goal should have stood 100%
That win very important, because in the front we have three massive game with Newcastle, Tottenham and Chelsea
How is that a handball for Rashford? He got robbed for his first goal against Everton.
That was a goal from Marcus Rashford
No doubt Ronaldo is legendary but Antony, "a rising hero"
GOAT with no weak foot..🤩
CR700🇵🇹👑🐐💯💥🥵
de fYnal score at GOODS Park eiiz:- ************** CR7 700 ************** EVE 1 #########
i must say antony is so clea at his finishing when he is with the goalkeeper .... confident , smooth and strong finishing doesnt fk around doesn second guess it .
Congratulations to THE ONE AND ONLY KING OF G.O.A.T CR7 700 goals and still counting... SIIIIUUU 🔥👍👏🦙🦙🦙
Casemiro assist to Ronaldo
Highlights is very sweet when we win matches ♥️
Congratulations Cr7 for 700 club goal
Terrible miss feom Casemiro
That Rashy goal should have stood then there's no panic at the end
That degea save was mad  props to him
VAR needs scrapping cos how is Rashfords clean goal a handball? Brooo FA needs to fix up!
Vamos Ronaldo
Since when is the ball touching a shoulder handball? Absolutely baffing. Happy with the result nonetheless
Respect from Turkey. MANU must shame without squad for CR7. We love you RONALDO
Criss❤
CR7👍😍🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹

Ronaldo GOAT 🐐🐐🐐
Alus Cr7...resep
Anyone noticed rashy going down in the end after that block.. hope he's fine.❤ Great team performance.. let's go go go.💪
Why was Rashford's goal disallowed.
entah kenapa meskipun ronaldo jarang bikin gol sekarang,sekalinya bikin gol sangat berkesan dan spesial
Lucky lucky mu Locky lucky mu
You only post the wins
Pendu scoring after thousands of open chances
Glory Glory man united
Stop commenting about Ronaldo (of course we should be glad he scored but get over it) and do something about GLazers!!! THEY MUST BE REMOVED FROM OUR CLUB!! Jesus, we r man utd and we r celebrating a win against everton as if we won the champions league!!! Wake up people!!!
Who is even counting goals
He is Back💪
Nobody is talking about Antony
We should never of sold garner
Video quality very poor
How on eather Rashford's goal didn't stand is beyond human belief. Ridiculous!!!
Loved Rashford sacrificing himself to block a shot in the closing minutes. Spirit that we haven't seen before!
The King 👑 is back CR7
cr👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Congratulations 👏 🐐 idol Cr7 😌
Ronaldo come on...ten hag....
Sign Dusan vlahovic from juve
💥💥💥💪
How is that a Handball?? HOW???
rashfoord is on fire!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔴🔴🔴⚫⚪⚪⚪⚪🔴⚪⚫⚫⚫💔❣❣❣❣
Rashford goal disallowed while barca doesnt get penalty for even bigger handball i am confused var was supposed to solve such problems...
Congratulations to Éric Ten Hag, staff,players,fans let us keep in winning every premier League and european game
Of course goat scores❤️🔥
Glad cr7 score atleast
Congratulations to CR7 for his career 700 goals. From James Bond to agent 700. Anthony is a GEM. He also plays football at top speed and his finishing reminds me of Coutinho in his prime. To be able to bend shots playing on the right-hand side and to use your left foot is pure genius. I feel like left footed players were born to play on the right wing.
The finish, class
Christiano is legend and legends can win games on there own .. Respect Legends ..Give them time and they will deliver huge ..
700 Goal ! Awesome 😁👍
Rashford goal was clean how they can cancel goal like these .Zoom and see VAR ..Idiots sitting in VAR room .
And one more time, giving goals to adversary.
That is NOT a hand ball !!! Hard luck Rashford
Cr7 best
Ronaldo amazing
Vive Ronaldo 💪👍👑
Give more play time for Ronaldo
Antony played his best game
Cr7❤️‍🔥😍
Vamos cristiano!
Eth susah sekali yakin dgn case miro, padahal dia pemain hebat, eth lbh bangga dgn pemain mantanya di liga belanda
Ten Haag should be sacked for not playing Ronaldo
Meanwhile Ronaldo haters hate goal disallowed....  "700" !!
Handball rule is the dumbest rule I've ever seen. Might as well tell players to run with hands behind their back. Stupid call.
Am I the only one to see Ronaldo not extreamly excited to score a goal? He would have been celebrating by then
Semoga eth semakin membuka mata.... Saat ini yg terpenting poin..
Who else have watched Ronaldo's celebration over and over again That was iconic,I felt like crying❤️
rashford handball😂😂
rashford handball😂😂
Manu united forever...Cr7 is still new his game in the football fields is so fantastic he deserves much time in more games to stabilize manu united position in every games
Who else will agree with me that Rashford is a fighter🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
We deserved that win
Antony is the supper machine
Just Believe in 🐐 i know he come back 🔥🔥🔥 Cr7♥️♥️♥️ Forever 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Premier league has the worst referees
This Anthony will go far. He is very fast
Man united should really appeal for that rashford goal! It never hit his hand! Should of counted!
Antony!
Akhirnya raja gol ronaldo
No Experienced Coach will leave a Ronaldo and casimero on the bench....Man utd coach needs to sit up or get out.
Man Utd 👏🥰 Cristiano Ronaldo👑 💪🥲 CR700😘
Siiuuuuuu
Rashford:s goal was a goal honestly!!! BUT WE TAKE THE WIN 🌟
If everyone was in same wavelength as Casemiro and Ronaldo, he would have been top scorer by now. That Madrid connection is just instinctive and those Madrid players were different breed.
COME BACK
MU
Cr7 700 & he is back❤️
Man utd didn't telecast their lose matches
Rashford's goal still pains me
Rashy Goal 100%
The phenom is back in the track
Siuu
Haters now see what a goal scored by cr7.....
I love that celebration from CR7
Yes Rashford goal was disallowed But for me till the end of this world will forever see it as one of the best goals in the game of football, looking at the effort and determination he put in to score   Won a header against Iwobi Took the ball from Tarkowski Dribble pass Pickford GOAL...
How is that handball
no....siuuu 😢
VAR continues to destroy the joy of football. Casemiro for that second United goal was outstanding.
GGMU ❤️❤️❤️
700 bb SIUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Y E S   CR7   !!
VAR robbed us
CR7❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏿👍🏿
Ronaldo always shows up when needed.
Siuuuuuuuuuu
Ehy rashford Goal where did it go
De Gea saved us from a draw but the Rashford goal should have stood
Antony will work Wonders for United. Time will tell.
There is no hand ball no foul. For what was Rashford's goal disallowed. Premiere league board should look after this or it is that they cannot digest United's win and getting back to the table. It is always the referees which comes in the middle of our win. We will still fight back. United forever ❤️💪
Aside everything...Iwobi's goal was beautiful
Who called him penaldo? Kutte
That was never a handball,, Rashford goal should have count
Boss is always boss.
First half was a foretell of how United can play under Ten hag.
Siiiiiiuuuuuuuuuu
Why the rules of handsball is constantly changing? 😲 Can someone explain it please
عودة مباركة  للدون بعد ما خاب الظن معظم الناس داخل المعلب ..
Congratulations Cr7
Cr7 ❤
Siiiiiuuuuuu
It's gonna be a Brazil world cup
Cristiano Rashford Casemiro Antony ❤🇮🇩
This boy Antony has got a dangerous left foot...🥺🥺
how was that a handball
4 star weak foot mate
Ronaldoooo
Casamiro assist Ronaldo goal .....🔥🔥
Big performance by CR7 🐐 ( Not only the goal )
GOAT
Casemiro is absolutely amazing
Antony real fast during counter
casemiro Shouldn’t be getting bullied off the ball
Ronaldo ❤️❤️❤️,,,
Rashford goal is not a handball. Ronaldo will score more. And i love antony even more now 💪🏼🔥🔥
ten hag should start ronaldo more he always performs
No handball rashford
It's sad that ronaldo got booed only when he retires will they know he is GOAT like messi we should be grateful to witness these 2 great players before our eyes. It may take 100s of year to find such players again. Halland so far is incredible
✌️
Ten Hag gotta put more respect on CR700!! He’s a Man United legend but more importantly he’s a football legend!! 🐐
O maior de todos, Cr7
Respect for Ronaldo
For eevryone that is saying messi is better than ronaldo at the moment, let’s see how Messi will struggle at 37 2-3 years later.
I'm happy to see the goal of CR7 😊
Best therapy for CR7 is scoring winning goals. All the best Legend 👍
High quality goal man..
I watched the rashford goal in 0.25 speed in 1:55, it was clearly a goal.
Where is SIUUUUUU
Come on Mancestet united, Come on Ronaldo
reshford qayti😜⚽️🏆
I’m a Man U fan and I can say this team is truly messy and unstable. I don’t know wha the plan is but we can’t keep getting lucky. Everton deserved a win here they were more decisive in their play and frankly played like a team with world class players. We ain’t going no where playing like this, these escape wins won’t help fix this problem either. Our defense is mediocre at best out tackling and pressure when we loose the ball is none existent. I see a forward (Antony) doing more tackles and applying more pressure than the back four and defense. Our game is unpolished and scary when we loose the ball. It’s weird how many midfielders don’t know how to apply pressure when the ball is lost.
CR700❤
I am happy for Ronaldo
👌👌👌👌
Manchester Is Red Respect from Indonesian
Eriksen tried to score today...I was jumping, I hope he tries more often I want to see him score ..will be soo happy
VAR is a fookin joke
Siuuuuuuuùuuuuuuu
CR7 is goal Left Leg 😱😱😱😱😱😱
CR700. I hope ETH thanked him personally for adding three points to the team's tally. As far as I could see it the first goal for Everton was not because CR7 didn't press or run back.
CR7 is goal Left Leg 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Rashford incredibly unlucky to have his goal disallowed
Man UTD should score atleast 3 or 6 goals until Goal difference goes up
Back to back man of the match performance from the goat
Ronaldo and antony celebration together was amazing
C ronaldo the best
He is best for a reason,  dammit that's a left leg goal 😂😂
The king is back. We all support CR7 the real GOAT
Ronaldo always should be in first half not in 70,80 minutes because Ronaldo can score in any angle if they assist him
RonaldoxCasamero❤❤❤
Handball where ?
I would have cried if we drew that game in the last minute..70% of our football was tenhaag football.. really enjoyed it
Ayo bangkit lagi CR
it has to be Casemiro who is right to pass the ball to CR7 compared to MU players who last long to pass the ball still half-heartedly, that's why there isn't a ball that is right for CR7, if Ten Hag has to be selective
Here we go. My man is back. One goal one assist.
Where is the City vs United highlights ?
casemiro yang paham akan posisi ronaldo 🤭, coba aja dari dulu ada yg kek dia
And now Ronaldo scoring form this season continues.. what a relief
Finally CR7 reaching 700 goals. What a milestone.👏  but let's not forget how poor Man Utd were in 2nd half.  they gave away the control. I'd like man utd to keep the game under control for 90 min, not for the first 30 or 40 min.  Martial has impressed this season whenever he has played. Came up with an important assist. Let's hope he recovers soon
❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
2 more goals = 500 league goals
They need to double check that Rashford goal
Goat is back
CR7
Ronaldo is the real G.O.A.T
Who disallowed that goal
King is back
That Rashford finish!!!!!
I don't know how much money was offer to VAR for disallowing rashford goal.
the goat put a smile on me again :)
Weak team and beat Manawij 😒😔
New celebration CR
Just lets Ronaldo play in every game..
Congratulations. Cristiano for 700th club goal.... wish you more goals and success.
suuuuuuuuuuuuuuu is back GOAT
Casemiroo, man on the match! ❤️😩✍🏽
UNITED 😍
Cr7 7000th
Love how man United posts games that we win but not the ones we don’t win. And we have to go like retards watching highlights on other clubs channels
That handball is jokes
first ever player who scored 700 club goals 😎 and he is still playing in toughest league while some of others enjoying retirement in farmers legue 😂🤣
Someone has performed black magic against Ronaldo which affected his performance.
We shouldn't have sold James Garner he nearly scored against us and was decent in the last 20 minutes
Akhirnya bisa cetak Gollll Christiano Ronaldo 💪
Rashford goal was a goal we got robbed but shaw what a performance
Well play 👍🏻 GGMU
Ronaldo is Ronaldo
Ronaldo happy, world happy ☺
That was not a hand ball
comeback Everton vs Manchester United 1-2  Congratulations Ronaldo club700th GOAL RONALDO is GOAT MANCHESTER UNITED is KING in PREMIER LEAGUE history  ANTONY is First GOAL RONALDO is second GOAL like CR7 fan and Manchester United fan
It's just the start of a long series of defeat be prepare to cry man utd fans remember that  even guardiola and klopp cannot help your club of clown to win trophies
What a bench player! 🔥
In Ronaldo's goal, notice the speed of Anthony 😍
VAR disallowing rashfords goal is a disgrace !
Can any explain me y rashford goal was not given??
Ronaldo suii the great legend
The king of record is THE CR7❤️❤️❤️
Suiii!!!
Suiii
Rashford goal should have been given
up Manchester ❤
CR700👑
Casemiro from an unforgivable mistake to a world class midfielder and an assist! BAFFLING! United's best player so far this season, even though we have already forsaken him..is Martial. This fu**ing team! Who deserves what? I hate and love every player! Crazy....
700 club career goal for c.ronaldo
Gj
Anthony is the best buy. I don't understand why rashford's goal is disallowed?
Classic Ronaldo goal. Well taken.
Was so sweet watching Anthony join Ronaldo In the celebration 😍😍
Everton  man utd 4:4.  This game away united from 1st place in APL. Never forget
Rashford goal should have stood
I love jesus
Where the highlight agains City? Why you wont upload? 😭😢
AT ALL COSTS MANCITY SHOULD NEVER WIN A PREMIER LEAGUE CUP AGAIN.
Glazers out
De Gea is the Best Goal Keeper in The World.
i came here for Ronaldo celebration 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Antony was awesome! he is fantastic killer
De Gea needs to wake up!
cr7 bac🤩🤩🤩😘😍😍😍k
MU, teruslah melangkah ke jalur juara. Antony, semoga anda menjadi superstar selanjutnya, bertahanlah disini, raih yang terbaik
GOAT Ronaldo the King 🐐
CR7 not compared with bruno
Suiiiiii
I need an answer as to why rashford’s goal didnt stand!
Man rash deserved that goal😐
We play really well under ten hag the style is amazing
Everyone is saying, Ronaldo is back, keep him playing. In my opinion he is garbage ,he is like a winy little child,
penaldo finito comes to the rescue
Berapaoun skornya klo Ronaldo cetak gol rasanya puas banget
Unpopular opinion: I think Ronaldo should go back to left wing again
I miss Mason so much man I want to cry
Why do they make them soo shot ? Why can’t they make 10 min highlight videos ?
Is hand ball them give on Rashford?????? What????? So hold on VAR nah work??? The ref never view it?
Siuuuuuu
How is no one talking about the save De Gea made, man is nothing but class when he has a strong defence backing him
Nice one  from the Goat
yes cr7 nice im happy , siuuuuuuuuuuuu.......
What the hell was the referee/VAR smoking to disallow Rashfords goal? That's was scandalous
ronaldo need new club
Rashy’s goal should have stood. The ball ricochet off his chest and not his arms. Replayed it so many times and it didnt hit his arm at all. If Everton had equalised so late in the game, the decision would be super questionable. That should be Rashy’s goal.
Harry maquire on bench ALR?
ANTONI THE BEST
Big applause for team and Ronaldo we love u ♥️ keep it up
❤️
Siuuuuuu
For Real. Iwobi goal was very nice
Congratulation Yaur 700 goal team the best G.O.A.T CR700
CR700 🤩🤩🤩👑👑👑👑👑👑
Ronaldo fantastic please go on!
I'm happy with his soul
he's back, just let him play to full time 🥶
Congratulations goat for 700 club goals , respect
enkara messi enkara messi goal goal goal goal goal goal ..................
Jadon Sancho has to take a lesson from Antony...... Just, be aggressive,shoot and kick the ball repetedly..... Simply, holding the ball and circulating it between your legs has nothing to do for the club
Ronaldo score seals win for Manchester United.
Remove coach plz
Gol 700 al máximo nivel, y no en la Liga Francesa de bajísimo nivel. CR7 pasado presente y futuro🇬🇹
Siuuuuuuuuu Ma  king Cr7😍🥰🥰🤐🤐
CR700
Bro they robbed Rashford 😂
Why you not show Ronaldos celebration 😢🎉
Madrid vibes😍😍😍
Two mistake two goals poor but lucky Manchester united
Thanks gents. well done to Christiano and the team of man utd
that rashford goal should be given.
❤️
Still not clear why Rashford goal was disallowed.🤷‍♂️ Ridiculous decision there.
We need iqbal in front of caseimrio.
This commentary is better than the old one
CR7 Unstoppable Force... This Guy Is Just Inspiration For Youth Footballers No Club Shud Make Him Sit On Bench And Try To Lose His Form Bcoz It Not Gonna Stop Him..Club Shud Feel Motivated To Have Him  Go Ronaldo Go...Wanna See 1k Goals before Retirement
Ronaldo antoni casimero wajib dimainkan jika mu Ingin menang
Cmon refs, rashford goal is clean af
Cr7 is goat🐐❤
Cr7 🔥🔥🔥 Antony 👍
"Premier league" the most inconsistent referees in the fkn world
C.Ronaldo best player
Messi fan...but loves Ronaldo....❤️❤️❤️
C700 🐐
Congrats Cristiano! 🐐
Ronaldo and Casemiro is gold not old.
Semangat, legend cr7
Rorooo
Sure the rashford one was handball but the Saliba, scamacca and Antonio ones were not.....all we ask for is for consistency....
Well played Reds!!! Way to go!!!
Form is temporary. Class is permanent.
Casemiro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
CR 7 King of the world
The best match ever this season♥️
Thank you 🙏
Siiiuu Casemiro la pierde Casemiro la recupera y se la da a su Comandante Y gooll 700 a CR7 !!!! Disfrutemoslosss
both were great goals! What a save by DeGea🔥 frm a liverpool fan🤝
The goat’s back
SIUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Give Ronaldo Respect,Trust,Support from the whole team...then Ronaldo will give you Glory. That's the mentality Ronaldo need's
How was Marcus's goal disallowed? He had to jump because the defender tackled him and on top of that the ball bounced off the defender's feet. Is Marcus supposed to jump with his hands tied behind his back so he doesn't handle a ball? WTH
Ronaldo is back
Thogden is a mug 😂
ARSENAL FAN HERE, WHEN RONALDO SCORES THE WORLD IS AT PEACE ✌️
What a play from shaw...the guy really dominated the game
Rasford goal is a clean 👌🙌 goal no hand ball, the referee is very wicked for not taking that goal
He do it himself no comparison with mfs Haaland🤗🚮
Happy 700th goal Ronny
So the Middlesbrough goal against us wasn’t a handball while this was 🤦🏻‍♂️
casemiro mulai gacorrr...
Watch man united play this season, and bruno fernandes seems to like to show to ronaldo that he is the captain in man u  and always blaming ronaldo. Thats what i see.
Ronaldo🥰
Antony >>> Scamcho
Ronaldo doesn't look happy there
Alhamdulillah, Ronaldo sudah bisa mencetak goal☺️🤲🇮🇩
Hé has almost 900goals
Why do you post only when you win
Anthony to Antony ❤🔥🔥
CR7 👑💪
That's is why we love cr7 ...
I'm an ipswich fan, Casimiro wins ball, threads Ronaldo, goal. Not fukn rocket science
Disallowing Rashford's goal was a travesty.
The King of football
The best in the history
Ronaldo 🔥🔥🔥
Legend
Congrats CR7
When did chestball started to be considered a handball?
suiiiiiiiv
I like MU because CR7....
Was that really a disallowed goal
Ronaldo’s goal got me emotional. Greatest of all time.. it disgusts me how much people disrespect this legend. But he doesn’t care and will still perform.. that’s why he’s the GOAT.
Cr7 tiene que ser titular siempre
I want Manchester United to play in the UCL again
Rashford robbed
great ronaldo
Manchester United is great
Let's all appreciate David De Gea's save
COME ON!!
Martial should be super sub
My GOAT CR7
Goodest Djob for Antony

CR700 SIIIIIIIUUUUU
Antony>Haaland
RONALDO MY LEGEND  Please I want access all areas video
De gea is something else. The save ❤️
I hope after this match,cr7 will get his confident again
What was wrong with the third goal of MU?
Apparently rashford should be Naruto running because there is no way that his hand was in a natural position there
Cristiano the best 👌
Still don't understand how that Rashford goal was handball
That save from degea saved the team yesterday
I just hope that stupid coach from now on puts Casemiro Antony and Ronaldo on the starting team every time! It’s crazy how dumb he is
Lucky goal by penaldo and his fans jumping like he scored a solo goal after dribbling whole of defenders
Rashfords goal is legit VAR human element will always make bad decisions
Ronaldo celebratetion is new meme templet
My GOAT is back 💟💟💟💟
GGMU. ❤
CR700
Ronaldo plays and we win. Imagine that!
That bald coach must know how to use cr7 casimiro & co accept maguire
0:41 anthony kerap melakukan ini saat masih perkuat ajax
Come back CR7 🔥🔥🔥
Rekor yang tak mungkin bisa di pecahkan, Dari cristiano. Salam dari indonesia🤗
I can see this coach starting Ronaldo....next game that shows he is not stable instead of starting Ronaldo all the game and all time....
I am Messi fan but... when Cristiano scored i smiled a lot :)))
THE KING,  THE GOAT 🔥🔥❤️❤️🙌🏾
finalyyy
I’ve reversed and replayed the Ronaldo’s goal a 100th time now 😍 why wasn’t the celebration included on this highlight??!😑
Antony is on another level.....
Siuuuuuuuu
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🐐 cr7
Bravo CR7.....👍👍👍
That disallowed goal would have cost us  2 points....come on put some sighted officiials in VAR😡
Siuuuuuuuuu
Winning goal by cr7 ...
GGMU !!!
Livin the dream... thank you all. So glad to see Christiano playing and 700 goals = phenomenal. David - fine save. Pleased for you all. 🥰👍
Suiiiiiii... 😍
Viva Ronaldo Viva Ronaldo....  🐐🙌 siiuuuuuuu
Antony saya tahu dia akan jadi pembelian sukses, dan CR7 mengunci kemenangan. semoga CR7 tidak dicadangkan lagi
Finally, happy to see Casemiro starting again. Time to get McTominay out, he doesn't deserve a place in this Man Utd squad.
Siuuuuu
Martial ffs mann
Siuuu 😀😀😀😀😀
Uhuyyy 🔥❤
Let cr7 play bo
BLEACH anime return, Ronaldo's 700 goal and win against mental health problems. This week can't get any better.
Let's go Manchester united 🔴🔥 GGMU

Wow
How did casemiro and eriksen didn't score today and what a disgraceful var decision
Siuuuu🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations cristiano 700
CR700
new celebration unlocked😂🤩
I think Rashford's goal is a legitimate goal
The goat deserve every thing
congradulation to the goat to reach 700 goals with the club
That assist from casemiro is so amazing and he knows how to pass ronaldo in the right position   Madridista
The GOAT.
🤫🤫🤫🤫
Ronaldo is gash. All of the clowns on here praising him would likely revel in being tea bagged by him.
Ronaldo King Of Footbol
The intro really got downgraded
🐐
100% goal from Rashford
😍😍😍amazing cr7
ronaldo : iam not slepp
CR 700 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was no handball by Rashford...wow .
These match officials r absolute MF's. How's that a handball??
The King 👑 is Back!!! ❤
vamoooossss CR7!!!!! The Real GOAT 🔥🤩❤️😍
Casemiro moving from 2/10 to 9/10 in ten seconds isn't talked about 😂
MU 🔥🔥
Bruno assits,Anthony Goal Casemiro Assist, Ronaldo Goal Rashford Goal,rejected by Var  😂😂
Both of Man utd goals were a result of Everton's mistakes
Just watch this highlights cause Ronaldo scores
Where's Manchester Derby highlights?
Finally Ronaldo got 1 Goal 🙃
Cr700❤️👑
Casemiro assist
Bro Antony is killing it...
3 years into VAR and still zero consistency. Ruined the beautiful game and you still have helmets buzzing for it every week. Sad state of the world
Antony should start taking on players!!
Var plonkers need to get down to Specsavers Monday - it clearly hit Rashfords chest not any part of his arm or hand.
The King is back!
anthony the next cr7
even as a Messi fan, it was actually sad seeing CR7 getting benched and having a  difficult start to the season. I missed those days when Messi and Ronaldo were at the top of the football world, doing things no other players could do. Now I only hope to enjoy see them play their final years and give us a glimpse of what they had been doing the last 10-15 years.
Ronaldo 🔥
VAR is a joke. This is the second time a VAR has been against us, including a handball given to Martinez against Sociedad.
Left foot 🦶 goal
Am a messi guy all day long but wow 700 club goals is not an easy task to achieve CR7 is special and will always be special 🔥👌🏼💯
Lets score again  siuuuu
Rashford getting the confidence back 🥺
The best Cristiano 👌🏻💪🏻👏🏻 CR700
Different rules for man utd gave the same goal in West ham game 😠
SIUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
VAMOS CR700 And ANtony00
Siuuu
Legends never fall cr7 🔥
GGMU 🔴
So happy for Ronaldo ❤
Congratulations CR7..... Legend always legend ✊❤️
let Ronaldo and Casemiro play more, than letting them rot on the bench, they're not getting any younger
I like casemiro starting line up
casemiro - ronaldo, 1st win together CMIIW I am looking forward what tenhaag sees this situation.
Aku sangat bahagia ceran gol Cristiano Ronaldo 7 di liga Inggris bersama Mencester unaitid bisa cetak gol 😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kami mohon cristian ronaldo jangan di cadangan kalok MU mau terus menang
Martial :/ No luck for this man
Ronaldo you absolute Legend 💚
When CR7 is on the pitch every player began to  produce goosebumps........ Never doubt the King
Glazers out glazers out glazers out glazers out and another glazers out
Rashford got robbed... ball was kicked into him from the ground.
Gol ronaldo mana suu
Cristiano ronaldo has proved his trade mark. Never under estimate  him. u assist him he will finish the job.
Red is red ♥️
Cr7 is the best 👍
I was emotional when I saw Casemiro giving that pass to Cristiano ROnaldo man! REmember me from Real Madrid vibes. Who knows they won oone more cup this year?
👍
C’mon that was not a handball Premier League referees seeing things lately
I'm soooo happy for Ronaldo
What did the referee smoke? Rashy scored such a beautiful goal!
Where is Peter drury when we need him
I hope mu win a 1 trophy in this season
Where is the video of your team lose against Man city by 6_3????? Upload that too 😂😂😂. Your pride is down now mR. Fuckguson
Lampard out
Cristiano ronaldo is become better and better. He the champion!
Why was that a handball?
They have posted this week 😂 what happened last weeek?
CR7 is back
That casemiro pass tho... 🔥🔥🔥
Cristiano Ronaldo is back❤️‍🔥
Ronaldo that is my boy🐐🐐
Delightful to see that Iwobi scored after Everton robbed Casemiro and Casemiro punished Iwobi to assist Ronaldo's goal...hahahaa...Iwobi is my brother though
Siuuuuuuuu!!!!🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉
All 3 goals of this match is better than whole farmers league season🦥
Ggmu
Ronaldo running around pressing, falling back and helping the defense, starting the counter... Only had the midfield been better yesterday, we would have scored more. Rono was everywhere. Eriksen and Casemiro lost the ball a number of times
❤❤❤❤❤👏👏👏👏👏💪💪💪
Martial jalan sehat 30 menit masih bisa kasih 1 assist
CR700
Casemiro ❤️
win
We're all happy to see the boys playing so well but let's not get too excited because it's a new season and I'm really excited about his tactics❤️
Cr7 the GOAT 😪🥰😍 i am so happy for the milestone legend 🥰
Sometimes you wonder how these VAR works.... maybe they too have affiliations
Antony is a blessing to united.
Love from Mauritius 🇲🇺 ❤️
Manchester need new goolkiper
Antony💔
Casemiro has been sloppy and not at his best,  Hope he can keep getting time so we can see him boss.
still runs down the wing and scores woth his left foot ...yeah he is finished
If you give Ronaldo more time, He'll definitely become that legend again🤩🤩🤩
If Rashford’s was a handball what on earth was Watmore’s goal vs United that wasn’t penalised?
Hard fought
Rashford goal 100% what a reffere
they kept showing us the footage and I still can't see when it touched his hand, Rashford was robbed
Ronaldo is not even happy anymore.
Liverpool penalty on💯
Cr7
im so happy to see ronaldo score again
Chúc mừng a7
That disallowed Rashford goal shows everything wrong with PL.
VAR ruled out Rashford goal was absurd and I guess VAR Referee should be trained better in making such assumptions. Handball in soccer is classified as the player's attention or attempts to get the ball onto their path or blocking and deflecting it from a potential goal. Whereas it's  permissible if the ball hits the bodies likewise in Rashford's case his chest and bounced to his head and he also had to jump to avoid collision from the defender, his hands were not even touching the bouncing ball. CR7 goal was awesome.  We need a replacement for De Gea. He's no longer a shot stopper but just a mere acrobat player. He can easily catch the 1st goal if he was at the right spot.  Luke Shaw needs to be more "violent by tackling timely" and clear incoming balls or blocked passes/crosses.  I hope Martial has a speedy recovery.  GG MU .. more attack oriented and don't give the ball back to defenders after the team has launched a counter attack.
Wrong decision handball what a shame
Antony's speed is fantastic👍
akhirnya bang🤣
Ronaldo 700
GGMU🔥🔥🔥
One of Rashford's all time best goals chalked off for no reason... 😔
How the 🤬was the third goal disallowed?
AGENT CR-700
Why wasn't His celebration fully shown? 🤨
ronldo is the ........best and always will be no one can replace him
Casemiro class
Antony gives proper 'young ronaldo' vibes.
What's the use of VAR again coz am becoming increasingly confused!
CR7 IS BACK
CR700💪💪💪💪💪🥳
Imagine being the Man United Channel and not showing the Ronaldo celebration for his 700th goal 🤦‍♂️
Наш Роналдо вернулся надеюс снова голи будет забывать
Siuuuu 🔥

Kebanggaan ku Ronaldo ,salam cinta dari Indonesia buat setan merah.
Erik Ten Hag should consider dropping Bruno 😢
Iwobi goal is smooth.

After a long time Ronaldo scored a Goal
C.Ronaldo For 700 Goal Club To You Congratulation I Say 🎉👏❤🙏👑

*7* 00🐐
ggmu
Ronaldo +casmario
I just hope Ten Hag will learn to be giving Ronaldo more playing time so he will shut up those critics thinking he is gone. He still remains the goat🐐
Ya era hora que hiciera algo ese paquete...
CR700
Play Ronaldo wide like he used to be in RM n MU as an Inside Forward like Salah..N u'll get the best version of him..  Btw i dont like Bruno attitude that moaning all the time. He need to relax like Scholes unless he is DMF like Keane hell only bring unrest minds to the upfront attack with Bruno attitude like that..I dont like him..
Cr7 scored a 700th club goals and winning goal too
So bad for David gea. Why he play with this team. He should had leave 4/5 years ago .
Bring back Ronaldo's confidence
Shut up to all haters of cr7.
Every time they try to write him off he just laughes in their faces🐐
From now on we will call him CR700
Siuuuu ❤️💯
Viva Ronaldo
How on earth Rashford   Goal was disallowed
Finally he scores
Even though I love Messi more it’s great to see him happy
Perlahan Ronaldo, ketajamannya mulai muncul kembali seiring kesempatan bermain semakin bnyak.
Lindelof is better than clown Harry Maguire 👍👍. Bravo united!
GGMU🔥🔥🔥
Ronaldo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Rashford goal should have stood 100% Scamacca and Antonio goal was given in similar circumstances if it was handball and disallowed why those two goals given.............. always biased decision in  EPL and VAR... full biased ....
MU should do the same with Ronaldo as MC does with Haaland and Ronaldo will score like always did.
Ronaldo have a GOAL😊
Happy happy Cristiano fans 👏
how tf is that a handball tho
Another record cr700❤️❤️❤️ go ahead more my boy🙂
Antony must be praised..he just gives all his soul in every match..If some of more players could have mentality like him.
The greatest to ever step on a football field
Football = CR7
*That relived celebration by Ronaldo would be forever in my heart.*
So happy for Ronaldo

When Ronaldo scores one goal, he feels happy as if he scored a million goals
I'm really liking this Antony guy, he has got passion for this game and this club😎
Stupid decision from refree with var 😵‍💫
As Arsenal fan am happy CR7 scored today, after all the disrespect he had been shown by ten hag. Form is temporary class is permanent
what is with these reffs
As Arsenal fan am happy CR7 scored today, after all the disrespect he had been shown by ten hag. Form is temporary class is permanent
What a shame, Rashford's goal is pure football!
From Casemiro to Ronaldo 🐐
Why rashford's goal rule out? Is it handball?
That 700 club goals feeling for Ronaldo and Antony by his side👍🥳🤩 N a beautiful assist from his long time teammate Casemiro 👏

Even a struggling Cristiano Ronaldo is far better than Bruno Fernandes.
This was 3-1 not 2-1
full smile 😊🔥
the ONE &ONLY living LEGEND on this planet ,,THE TRUE GOAT CR700,,💪💪💪
Var ruins football
Casemiro was class!
CR 7, 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
win or lose, we still love this club
Ten Hag needs to play his best players. His personal opinions and differences with a few members of the squad is harming the club.
Ronaldo has two 0 in hisname and he is nomber 7. What's a conspiracy
Cr7 is the best player in the world but some people said that he is finished ❤️❤️
Legendaris 🐐 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  🇮🇩
Why rashford goal disallowed
6-3...🤣
Rashford robbed😔
Lol until you meet us, the blues😂
Ronaldo
ronaldo fans... 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩👍
Cr7's celebration will be iconic.
Oh no james Garner😭
Superb, my best wishes for the session, two win against two top teams is a very positive sign
Ronaldo was like 🦦
GGMU ♥️🔥
CR700!!!
Why the hell was rashford goal disallowed????
CR7 for starter! 👇
Casemiro 🔥👌
Next summer, bring Benjamin Šeškoto replace CR7, please.
Casimero with an assist from deep! That's something mctominay cannot do! I hope fans see that! Win the ball find an attacker!
Such a shame. They disallowed rashford goal 😡
HANDBALL???
too short for me,may be you can make it litle bit longer for the highlight. 10 to 15 min ok for me 😁
Trending lagi nih
panaldo🤣🤣🤣
Rashford goal would have been goal of the month if it is allowed
Happy Ronaldo score goal
Can someone explain why Rashford's goal was disallowed?!
Jotdoo's performance is perfect
CR7 scores a single goal this season (except penalty), but he scores the goal with his Left foot being a right footed player. That's class 👏 👏
Rashford gaol is amazing but....​Why
Buy pickford please
700 goals to CR7... congratulations legend
Glad to see a legend like ronaldo can score again
Duet casemory asist to Ronaldo
They robbed Rashford goal it's not the same goal Antonio used to scored Fulham 🤔😔😭⚽
恭喜C罗 CR700 加油曼联
Where is that MUTV famous commentator
United is better than everton👍✨✨ Thanks..cr7🎈✨✨👍
Kang dodo nyetak gol dong
The first goal was done through a foul against casemiro.
King is back 699 goals is surpass is the difficult one for him but he surpassed. Nowonwords his time
700th goal for Ronaldo is amazing and Rashford's goal should've counted.
Ronaldo is the best ♥️
Hell the f was that a hand ball. Jesus mate you have it recorded to view it.....blind
Yg lawan city ko gada
Howcome Rashford's goal been disallowed? What a joke
Suiiiiiiuuuuu suiiiiiiiiiiii 😭❤️
Ronaldo is back
RONALDO 👌
Kalau pas menang aja di posting, Kalah gak mau diposting
GGMU from JAPAN🇯🇵
What handball?
I'm surprised his 700th goal didn't get a massive siuuu
The GOAT
And they said Antony was a flop signing
The King is back
Aku senang baget dodo cetak 1gol, muda2dodo tetap percaya diri dan sabar, dan dodo bisa terus tampil bagus?
What's the point of having VAR when Rashford's goal not stood...
The celebration 🔥
Cr7 🐐 ❤❤❤
Is Cristiano gonna leave next season? He seems like not happy even he won
I’m so happy to have finally seen the Goat score and i wish him the best for the next games
it is incomprehensible that Marcus is handball when the ball is quite balanced. while the Whest Ham United player controls the ball with his left hand very clearly but there is no handball no VAR and it's a goal
otak kemenangan ada di casemiro
Legend
CR7 is the best player ever.
That's disallowed goal from Marcus Rashford is annoying ...
Ronaldo will always be a legend the greatest of all time ❤️❤️❤️
Where is the match highlights of the trashing against Man City?
CR7😀
That handball cal was absurd
CR7 ❤️😭🐐
I'm so happy for cristiano ronaldo my idol my goat 🐐 🙌 ❤
The assist from casemiro,  how poetic it could be that it was casemiro who assisted cr7 for his 700th club goal,felt like it was madrid game, all the madrid players of the past decade know each other so well even after so many years
Penaldo 😀😀
Congratulations Ronaldo 🎊
vintage finish from ronaldo, love how he starts running as soon as casemiro recovers cause he knows whats coming
He is back.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥳🥳🥳🥳
just buy all real madrid players and tell them to pass to cristiano
Ohh, finaly ronaldo scores
Manchester is blue 💙💙🇮🇩
The Goat is back🐐
Eriksen  what man😍
Funny to see handball violation these days, does the player must tied their hand on their back in the future ? Rashford hand movement was pretty normal because the hand need to move like that for balancing the body after avoiding a tackle
Cristiano Ronaldo dan Antony penyelamat Manchester United naik ke  peringkat ke 5 klasemen sementara liga inggris 2022 💪💪💪💪
King is back 🔥
🇵🇹👑🐐Cristiano Ronaldo  700 goal 🔥  Sporting 5 ⚽️ Manchester United 144 ⚽️ Real Madrid 450 ⚽️ Juventus 101 ⚽️ ❤❤

One thing to coch of man unit was pls give confident to cr7  you has deadly goat in your club don't give demotivate or schold 😌

Casemiro assist ✨
Ronaldo x Casemiro ❤
Antony x ronaldo 🤗🥰
Cr7 🤍
Hats off CR7 for your 700 goals in club football. It's really nice to see you scoring.

It’s crazy how Ronaldo scored a goal after so long but it’s still a record 😍 As the GOAT said “the records follow me”
"You're love makes me strong, you're hate makes me unstoppable"  Form is temporary class is permanent.🐐
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
No Maguire no problems
500th Comment 🔥 Congrats Rono on 700 Club Goals! Ronaldo Coming back 🥶
Ronaldo's best position is not centre forward but is the free role out wide
3 points in de bag, congrats Ronaldo 700 club 🎉
i swear. De Gea kept making mistakes all over the map... he needs a holiday. also ,3rd ball should have been counted. it didnt touch his hands at all... what a shame.
🐐
Cr7 G.O.A.T

Rashford's goal was disallowed because the ref was a Everton fan and doesn't want to make it 3-1 lmao
카세미루 존나 못하네...
that isnt a hand ball
I finally got what I want, deep down in my heart knows even CR7 is not at his best he's still better than lots of player
Rashford GOAL!!! 3-1 !
Erik Ten Hag please start Cristiano ROnaldo in every game
É  muita burrice  deixar ele mo banco  , nós  sabemos que ele não é  mais o mesmo  .  Mas se bola chegar ele guarda  , se fizer um time bom ele faz . Se ele tivesse no cty  ele tinha mais gols que o haland.
Syuuuuuuuuuuuuh 🫵👏
Siuuuuu👏😁👍💪⚽⭐🤗😎🔥🇵🇹🐐😻❤🇧🇷😻❤
1:22 yang di tunggu tunggu

Congratulation to Ronaldo for his 700 club carrier goals.  A remarkable journey that is still excelling at the age of 37.
score porom antoni is the beastttttttttt
EVARTON
Prime ronaldo come back in world cup 😊siuuuuu
Two words Jordan Peterson
That finish of antony was rubbish tbh, the keeper even touched it😂
Tumben😂😂😂
❤️
This is going to be viral, yeah..
Today the spirit of determination of all the players in search of the 3 points showed, Casemiro gave an assist that before would have been a forgotten ball, the level of intelligence quickly stood out and by chance of life Ronaldo was close and solved the game. It's a matter of time for the team to gain strength and get along with these geniuses. Now we expect consistency from your parts
Hahaha siuuu
hoping upload any of match highlights faster in the future.  dont miss the celeration part pls, dislike this video
No Ronaldo no party....🎈🎈🔥🔥🔥 the man is a phuckin legend ten hag open your phuckin eyes 😡😡
Goat

Anthony assisting Antony... that's delightful. This team can become favorites for the EPL, you just don't know it.  Congrats to the GOAT on his landmark
Ronaldoooooo X siuuuu
In what universe is that handball? Refereeing is getting madder and madder every game! That decision could have cost Manchester United the game!
That's handball was sick decision
Man u a my but  them a joker  the corner them put over the ball them a take shot corner u have cr7  in the box
Antony💪💪💪
United showcased class, precision and form today. Buzzing the ball forward, back, and in tight spaces. The pressing, marking and attacking. The hunger and the dedication, I'm here for that.  Let's goooo!!
Viva Ronaldo!
👏❤
Siù
Klo Greenwood bsa kmbali ke tim utama,,psti kren breng anthony
VAR is a joke calling that handball ..
Jimmy Garner nearly punishing us near the end. I hope we put a buy back clause in that lads contract because he looks like a player.
Everybody seems to be doing well without lord Maguire lol
Antony my new favourite player
yeesssssssss goall for ronaldo
Dalot had a stinker, at fault for goal 1, and kept giving the ball away in dangerous areas constantly .
CR700
Cr7 is still the best
Finally CR7 Score in PL and CR700
How the hell that goal was disallowed Same as they had gave the penalty against Real Sosiedad which was not hand ball  What the hell is happening 😡😡😡
0:37 antony pace is insane🤯
He is just starting, watch out
Casemiro clas
Rashford goal is disallowed because var is made from everton

Please do not put CR7 on the bench. He needs more game to reach his best performance.

Defense still need improvement, that Everton's goal starter is embarrassing.
0:36 and the narrative was "we have slow and lazy wingers" now look
Love to see ronaldo on scoresheet ❤️🥺
Halland scoring for fun is not creating attention on anthony  Yes the lad is doing 💯 better match after match
Rashford goal?????.
CR7 IS THE BEST
just give cristiano a bigger chance. I mean, come on man he's a legend. everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
GUYS ANTHONY LOVES 1VS ACTIONS BUT I THINK HES SCARE BECAUSE OF THE NEW CLUB HE DONT WANT TO GET NEGATIVE REACTIONS ABOUT IT BUT HE WAS THE BEST ON 1 VS 1
PLEASE MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE TRUST IN ERIK TEN HAG HES ONE OF THE BEST MANAGERS U WILL EVER GET GIVE HIM TIME LIKE EVERY MANAGER NEED LIKE ARTETA HAD THE TIME TEN HAG MADE AJAX WIN EVERY GAME YEAR AFTER YEAR EVEN WHEN HE SOLD HIS BEST PLAYERS
2 goal or 3 goal
학식포드 왜 골취임 ㅡㅡ
Congratulations to the legend Cristiano Ronaldo for reaching the 700th goal in his club career What a great achievement ❤🐐 What a great goal to secure three very important points, I wonder why the amazing coach Tin Hag Cristiano always sits on the bench!! Martial is participating today, and he is injured. Cristiano deserves to participate. I hope that Cristiano, Rashford and Anthony will play mainly in attack in the upcoming matches
Casemiro masih ingat oper Ronaldo 🤩 hehe siuuuuuuu
Selamat Manchester United
Ten Hag ơi sao ông không cho các cầu thủ trẻ vào sân? Họ là tài sản vô giá đấy ông?
GGMU
Local pride 5 1
Anthony is the best transfer in this season
Where is 6-3 Highlights?

Отлично Мужики. Только Юнайтед  Только победа

Ayo ronaldo cetak gol dan asist
WHO SAID CR7 IS DONE ALREADY? Viva ronaldooooooo!!!!
Ronaldo put in a shift today, he made tackles in the midfield when the rest of team were just watching Everton move the ball around.
Not the end, this is the beginning of Cristiano 🔥
Only win admin share video
CR700
all chest, by rashford
Antony is being overshadowed because of halaand and us losing to city, but honestly I’m buzzing about his form. He’s one of those guys that can make something out of nothing and is a class finisher
We were robbed off a goal.... Antonys left is sweet
بلتوفيق
till now, i don't know why ten hag rarely put ronaldo as a starting
Akhirnya bisa gembira juga di hari senin.
really like this kasaymero fella
Just IMAGINE how great we COULD be… but only with Glazers OUT!!
kembalikan senyum ronaldo

Ronaldo🎉
CR7 = goal to 700
Players should have stopped that goal
Mwheee,menang juga akhirnya
Where is the old commentator that guy has been here since ronaldo's 07/08 season I miss him
glazers out
HOLD UP! That ball didn’t touch his hand though. Or am I going crazy!?
Ronaldo mulai pecah' telor
Finally a player who really loves cr7 and not jealous of him playing for man utd… we won’t see such an honest player who would pass the ball to cr7 such as casimero …. If you other players concentrate on cr7 and pass the ball more often to cr7 they will definitely win all trophies… best 2 players from Real Madrid scored beautiful goal ❤
Pray for KANJURUHAN INDONESIAN🙏🌺
3 points, this is the most important thing, but we need some better player than Diogo. Tu much mistakes today… and last 15 minutes was terrible. we have lucky. I hope next match with Newcastle will be better
Ronaldo es el mejor
Ronaldo Left foot strong than ever 💪
Love to see my man scores again, SIUUUUU
For the next Derby Manchester, please using the full Brazilian and Portugess players to counter collective type plays... I'm pretty sure their individual skills can ruin it.
Siuuuuuuu
Cr7 gollllll perdana
Would they have given that as a penalty if it had happened in the box or not?? That couldn't be a penalty if the ball caught the arm in the box in such a manner, because the player wouldn't know anything about that, then how did they disallow Rashford's goal?? It's getting increasingly difficult to understand the game anymore.. The general performance from the team now, I think we really should give ETH time, he definitely has the ability to lead us in winning titles, we can be confident in him, but we can't in those termites in our board that they would give him full backing and get him all that he requires, for that's the only way we will be able to witness a real transformation.. This season is a working progress, so I'm willing to be patient with the manager and new players, but not sentimental, neither to the players nor ETH.. I hope even him will learn from his mistakes and get better also, not only the players..
I like humble Rashford. He was looking to pass instead of dribbling.
Antony！！
CR7 is 𝐾𝐼𝑁𝐺  ♔🇵🇹♔
Goal Rashford kenapa di anulir??
handball????? var officials need eye check...pathetic!!!!
Why there is not much concentration on cr7 goal ? We need to see it from diff angles 😡😡😡😡😡😡
- Dalot should help Anthony more with dummy runs and quick 1 touch link ups. - Ronaldo should be advised to play like Ibra and Haaland where he faking onside runs. And learn to do quick a quick 2 touch to get away from defense and shoot. - Sancho and Rashford should fight for the LW role. - Anthony on the RW - Erikson and bruno should play at CM (not CAM) - Casemiro CDM - Varane, Martinez CB. Malacia has to learn to link up with Sancho/Rashford - Dalot's role should be challenged by Fred. Dalots sits on the ball way too long.  And United back half should learn to be more nimble with quick touches. Play 1-2. They think too much and the opponent closes down. Send in Long balls when wingers ask for it. Have faith in each other
GOAT! CR7 700 goals club career. 20 Years and 2 days 5 - Sporting CP 118 - Man Utd (1st spell) 450 - Real Madrid 101 - Juventus 26 - Man Utd (2nd spell)
Everyone played there part today and so did Var with shocking decisions too
menang anying
Nothing shows Rashford goal is illegal, Ridiculous even with VAR
Finally Haters gonna saying he can't goal 🥅 now Cr_7 goal machine has started 💕🔥 may he continue this till the end of season
CR7 cool
CR7 cool
Cr7 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
those who criticize him in his bad times don't have any right to celebrate his success!
SIIIUUUUUUUUU
Why wasn’t the Rashford’s goal counted?
❤👏👏👏👏👏
Well done CR7. You keep cementing yourself as an all time GOAT!  Thanks for coming back to us :)
Well done CR7. You keep cementing yourself as an all time GOAT!  Thanks for coming back to us :)
❤️🔥 let's go Man Utd! CR7🐐
VAR costs you Marcus Rashford's goal annulled
Antony is super fast!! 😍
ANTHONY NEXT CR7
Casemiro had a chance to redeem himself with that header he missed but luckily for him he got another chance with that perfect pass to Cristiano. I am glad the team won. 🙏🏽
A: Who's scoring? B: Antony A: Who's the assist? B: Antony
Casemiro assist 🔥
Ronaldo looking sharper. Just had to dust off a few comb webs.
Bang Do 🥺
Antony assist antony 🤔
Ronaldo always be G.O.A.T 🐐
De gea out aja
The disallowed goal is total bullshit. What's wrong with the referee?
I have to say, the way Antony score is just how a United player should be. I mean, he didn't wait too long. Just fired the shot whenever he had the chance. And he did. It was awesome.
should have been 3-1
How is that handball? Such a beautiful solo goal just disallowed by silly officiating. Rubbish! GGMU!
The legend shines again! 🎉🎉🎉 (700) Goals
Too slow Let me be your official Editor
Rashfords goal should have stood
Antony had a great game
siuuuuuuu
The ref was useless
Casemiro got intercepted iwobi score and then again iwobi got intercepted by casemiro and he assisted Ronaldo to score the winning goal. Football Y’all 🍿🍹😎
GGMU
It is a disgrace that Rushford goal didn't count
De Gea 🤯
Manchester united needed a player like Anthony, 3 goals in 3 games!
VAR is really pointless at this point. Great game tho lads🔴. Glazers out🔰
What wrong with rashy goal ?😮
Goatnaldo
Congratulations to CR-7 ❤️ for achieving his 700 goals.   My G.O.A.T 🐐😍
Antony has been a revelation for Manchester United and big man Cristiano Ronaldo is back.
Rashford Goal Should Have Stood  Very Harsh Decision
how's that rashford goal disallowed bro 💀
That's another one for the dubious official panel. How can Rashfords goal be a handball. With all the eyes to the screen and technology
700 club goals😈
That Rashy no goal is pretty suspect
how was that a handball??????/
"They might be to old, fleashed out, ruined by popularity, but when needed; fading goats 🐐 produce chilling goals". Legendary
Cr7 The 🐐👑❤️
Ronaldo, im crying 😭
RONALDO IS BACK!!!!! SEWEY
I will name that Ronaldo celebration "Nirvana" which means freedom from suffering in Buddhism.
RONALDO WELCOME CHELSEA JANUARY 2023 💙👏
Ronaldo is back trust he will score over 30 goals this season
Nimero 1 CR7
Cristiano ronaldo 🐐💪😉😢
WHY CUT OUT RONALDO CELEBRATION!
Cristaino🐐🔝🔙
I just regret the performance of the coach, Eric Tan Hag, who always has CR7 on the bench, try if possible to pair up with Antony,jadon sancho,CR7, then we will see the sharpness of the three Red Devils caretakers.
I am emotional and so happy to see CR7 end his goal drought.  Can we just take a moment to acknowledge Antony? His left foot is becoming a trademark for him on that side
honestly, rashford's goal decision was too harsh... it should have been a goal.... :(
That Ronaldo celebration is easily one of the most iconic celebration of this era. Its like achieving eternal peace, enlightment, being in heaven or achieving nirvana, like a person who is happily willing to die as he have achieved everything there is.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal against Everton in 17 years! The last time he scored against Everton, he was only 20 years old. And it was in the FA Cup. He scored 6 goals against Everton altogether. Which means this is his seventh goal against Everton. And his 700th club goal! Impressive! Right? Viva Ronaldo 😏 🔥 🔥
My Goat scored🥹🥹🥹
How was that hand ball
I'm happy Cristiano scored his 700th goal as a United player. 🐐🔴
Welcome back CR7
A current United legend and a future United legend both scoring, not a bad pair to have on the scoresheet
CR7
The game’s gone soft, how is that Rashford goal disallowed??
🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹🇵🇹😎  cristiano     Ronaldo     👍👍
Manchester United's improvement in this period their best solution now is to compete for fourth place qualifying for next season's Champions League🙏💖🙏💖🙏
The GOAT is back in business Siuuuuuuuuuuu
That ball by casemiro would never been played if it was Scott mctominay in the middle
Congratulations to Ronaldo big achievement
How was that a handball?
CR7 🐐 700th Club Goals and still counting.💥💥💥
That Rashford’s goal should have stood, chest and face no hands.
Akhir Ronaldo cetak....
CR7 *Antony celebration the best I ever seen in modern football 🔥.
GOAT
You can tell that casemiro knows when cristiano is in the right position from that assist. He didn't even think twice.  That's Madrid Vibes. Right there
CR7 the GOAT.
Siuuuuuuuu
Maguire and MC tominay motm 💯
Siuuuuuuuu
I love Martial and Sancho but soon Erik will realize that our best attack line Is Ronaldo, Anthony and Rashford ❤

It was a beautiful chances by Rashford🍻
Manchester united is becoming great team again. I enjoy watching this game  with time our team will be stronger and beautiful
It is a lesson for the haters it ain't over till CR7 says it is over 😎
Ronaldo's celebration was legendary like him.
Great Midfield today Erikson and Casemeiro🔥
