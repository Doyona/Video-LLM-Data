My friend almost commited suicide yesterday because her family hated on her and she said she needed some time alone and I waited, then she thanked me and we got along fine 😊I helped her out and now we just share a heart for each other ❤️
❤
Sad Lookers Then Yes the Nice Helps
The new kid was gonna kill him but then Ian made friends with him, that’s so heartwarming 😭
The coincidence I saw this after seeing a video of a cat that can predict death😂❤
So wholesome
"bro its a canon event"
W man
That is the best super power
Part 2 plsssss
❤😊🤗😇☺️😉
I love how he included suicide, because it has actaully taken a lot of lives, including my friend‘s brother. ❤
This brings a tear to my eye
Imagine being able to look in the mirror and prevent bad deaths. Must be fun
Wait the last one changed the rest didn’t they are still gonna die that way
He ruined a cannon event!!
Bro doest tell his dad
I can shoot fire out of my pe-
He is stopping canon events💀
But Ian saving that kid brought a tear to my eye 😢
The suicide part just shows talking to someone left out makes a difference
“It’s a canon event” 💀
If I got fire there will be no shark eating people I would make sushi out of them
You broke canon😂
That's beautiful! My heart!!!! I just started crying 😭❤️🫶
this video made me feel better somehow.. thanks
The last one 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹we need more people like that
Bros disrupting canon events
The weird kids way to die changed, but no one else's did
Wow
So depressing
I would save everyone in the world
I feel that weird kid that’s basically me minus the weird part
I was that kid once but a guy just like you decided to be my friend
The only reason i'm alive right now is because of my friends. They make me want to keep going. Thank you guys ❤
Why can’t I just find part two this is so annoying do you agree?
I showed this to my friend who is going trough mental depression and he really liked it recently he had wanted to kill himself but he thinks ur a really nice guy Tysm and I’m sure my best friend would say thanks too 🙏 😊
I dunno why I teared up 🥺🥺✋🏼😃
Bra
Bro literally just expanded his life so much
Death pact irl
It's amazing to think that that kind of simple action could prevent something as awful as suicide.
That last one was so wholesome!❤
So I guess the shark was hungry cause who wants to eat clothes?! 🤢
Thats quite a nice video
*forced into friendship*
but what about his own death?
last guy is the only one who had his cause of death changed
That is a great power
Ian randomly been born be like:make people die cause he made a ship to crash the Aestroid that made dinasour instinct why cause he i would die
You are now the kindest man I know
What's funny is that every time Ian tried saving somebody, unlike the new kid, their ending never changed. Meaning that he never saved anybody at all.
My hero academia
Emo kid les go
P2 pla
You're so lucky
lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Whats suicide
when u get the powers that save people lives sheesh nice video :)
It is the most useless power cause you see the cause of their death and its impossible to change that lol you are only preventing it
I love how he wanted to be friends with the depressed kid, that’s so sweet
He let his dad die tho 💀
so cute the music though....  Hes being so kind to everyone.......... Its adorable
I love you videos they are the best videos thank you
this is so wholesome?
Dude ur first friend Was probably endevor😂😂 srry somebody had to say it
Ok
Yet only the third one changes
My ex name is Tyler 🥰😍🤩💖😙🤣😂
Thats so sweet
Thats very nice what you did at the end 😥😥
Love ur vids they’re amazing
“Theirs a new kid?” “Yea, there is, and nobody wants to talk to him.”  That makes me a little more worried because I am going to a new school, because I was homeschooled, and my mom got stressed and gave up on it. I have an older half-brother and a twin brother, and one of my friends said that they’ve heard A lot of fighting and cussing at my school. I am going later this week and wish me luck!
give me more of these videos IMMEDIATELY i want this specific thing to go on for about 10 parts pls
This is so heartwarming
You should do a part two
Hey can u come to our school pls this one dud is a emo on the highest level
I will say that is the best superpower ever see how people die and u know u need to do something to not let that happen
Bro saved an Emo that's cool
Suicide me: oh I'm gonna do that.
My guy is still dying of a shark attack
This is why i try to make newbies feel good
Wholesomeness levels skyrocketing off the charts!!!!!!!!!!! :D
🥲 good people are too few and far between now.
Respect❤❤❤
I wonder what it’s like when one of bro’s neighbors see him doing one of these 💀
Wow…
Cool video
Jocelyn Flores
OOO🥺🙂 VIDEO'S END AAAWW🥺
The new kid at my school: is the quiet one who's a good boy Him in reality: very smart strategic and a gamer
Fr
I love that ending
God is good
SO GOOD❤❤😢
Thanks you made me feel something overwhelming and happiness
I wish someone will actually save me from being suicidal... But nobody does even after they saw the scar....
When you can see how people die
Awh that's so sweet
That's actually a good power!
WAIT NO THAT'S SO SWEET WTH
Some times all it takes to change someone’s life is to make the smallest difference
Really useful for yourself
The quiet kids have be changed the others didn’t.
Make another part
Ian: *aww bro im sorry there not taking hires yet*  Me: didnt he already get the job?
Ian just being Ian🥰
this is how you change someones death
THIS IS SO GOOD EDITED
When it said he would commit unalive I knew he was mentally depressed
"You know what,Lets be friends" "No" "Yes" "Lets be gay instead" "WHATT" 💀
Aww that’s so sweet Dang this was awesome      God bless you Jesus loves you And Holy Spirit be with you
Оу, как мило;)
That’s really sweet but did anyone notice even after he says he’ll walk his dads death is still a car accident
Ian:- Saves People After Predicting Their Deaths  The TVA:- Bonjour
He can shoot fire out of his hands === Agniāstra   Indians will understand 🤪😂🤣
"Fire out of my hands" POOTIS POW HAHA
Can you make a video on a superpower where you can know WHEN people die
httpsson9
"Just stop making jokes and hate it, isn't this what everybody really wants?"
The last one was really wholesome
69
Yay 😊
You did the right thing good job
love the ending😊❤️
If u are eating sinigang and watching  this video like 👇
*Friends till the End*
This man just stopped a su!c!de
Awwww
My mom will love you, 😐😐😐😐😐😐🤩
That was a myth
That was wholesome
Only if you got a notebook too, that would be a fun journey to see
Let me guess. He becomes friends with the weird kid and lost his powers.
Bro which contry are u from🤔🤔🤔
Couldn't help noticing "Yeah, no wants to talk him" 😂
If his father rooked him to school his father dies he will be in an accident and can’t go to school at least for a week when he leaves the hospital and join school again the person who was going to suicide would be dead till then 💡😂
So wholesome
Cute
Is the su*c*de kid's super power denial? Lol no offense to kids who feel this way or feel victimised/bullied
Being efficient by walking yay!
Lobe how it turns green and they become bffs (an assumption) also Ian is really good at coming up with excuses. Imagine the kid died of being bullied and pushed into a fire by the fire kid lop
I think that super power is soo very useful☺☺☺☺
Aw that's so cool
Wholesome
Wow this video made My day Poor boy
Part 2 pls
IAN BOGGS I M YOU BIGGEST FAN
The last one is very nice and very nice
The last one is the best along with the beautiful music
Last one gives a motive not to sucicde Bec no one talks to you
I love how you did that too him it really cheered Me up :)

To everyone out there. Don't commit.  There is so much more in life that you can enjoy. Something or someone change everything. What would you prefer, waste the chance of of a lifetime or live that lifetime?
It's sad how some people kill themselves just because they have have a miserable life. But one little act can change their life
So you see...
Do a part two of this please
E
That kid's feelings d3pr3551on it's like my feelings
The mousatch💀💀💀
Seeing death, that is crazy
lame play Minecraft
The end how the way he died was wholesome❤❤ (in my opinion)
I’m crying 😭 this is so sweet!
Me thinking and realise when his dad want him to school he realise he is gonna die too and he save two people,his dad and him.
Sup
Nobody praises this guy's creativity 👌
Die* not d!e, Death* not D3ath.
When you think about it, shooting fire out of your hands seems cool and all but wtf are you gonna do with shooting fire. Burn your bullies and get arrested?
Last one make my heart happy
That tuched me
Honestly this is kinda wholesome if you put it in a specific perspective
Wait so the cause of death changed only for the new kid how about the others-
Imagine you have this power and you save an austrian soldier from dying, only to realise he is Adolf Hitler
Aww
You saved people good job bro
Death: here is you life insurance
The boy : no  Lan: yes  The boy: no   Lan: yes  The boy: fine!
you make me cry dude :) wish i had someone like that
Epic bro, u deserve so much more love
Let’s be friends! 😇 *no-* I SAID, LETS BE FRIENDS 👺 *woah chill okay okay we can be friends~*
Dynamite: {\__/} ( • . •) / >🧨 I'll hold the record!  Butter: {\__/} ( • - •) / >🥞🧈  Hold my soju
The fact that you can change how people die really makes this power good.  (Reminds me of an manga where the girl can see future corpses of people who will die)
E
❤😔  My friend died  -su1c1de-😔
Bro can you make avideo with my name my name is Vishnu priyan
That’s wholesome.
You saved him
Iris zero reference
Oh my god, I WANNA MAKE A STORY ABOUT THIS NOW HOLY SHIT
when your dad s death doesnt change
🥲🥲
what if he said no
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 The kid didn’t die🥳🥳🥳🥳
Random guy : "i want to kill myself"  Ian : "let's be friends!"  Random guy : "life is so wonderful!" Me : 🤔
I’m almost crying 😢
dude, I can shoot fire out of my hands, it's Kai from the hollow
The kids dead  change but not the friends or the dads so
If I had tht power I would have done the samething though even without the power a new kid or weird means their nervous or depressed and don't want to live in this world so be kind to everyone
The end was heartful bro
bora reinaldooooooo
Most wonderful superpower
Oh
I just realised that when he became friends with that kid his cause of death changed. So that means the other people are still gonna die the same way.
"Who's gonna stop me?"
Some super heros remain unseen
This just shows how being someone's friend can change their life, and yours aswell. 😊
You will die in a car accident I will walk  What happen if u are walking on a footpath and someone crash a car into you?
This is actually wholesome
Happy 1M Likes (:
That's sad
I’m crying rn because that ending is the ending I want in my life I just want friends that will stay
09
Is there a part two
Pin
Could you tell me how many superpowers now you have 🤣🤣
I love the video but the sad music ☹️☹️☹️
This is surprisingly sweet ♡
Very effective way to use your superpower😎😎😎

Man's a lifesaver
His friends way death didn’t change after he told him that they weren’t hiring so uhhh yeah… 😬
Ian why you sad?😭😭
That last one made me cry tbh
I love your vids keep filming
When i get shooting water out of my hands i will go like "is this cuphead powers?"
No cuz that’s actually how you save someone’s life (speaking as someone who was suicidal)
₩
Talking to someone can make a big difference
I wish i had this- So i could have saved my grandfather-
THATS SOS COOL
WTH ONE MILL LIKES
You guys do realize his dad is still going to die by a car accident and his classmate is still going to die by a shark attack.
wOoW
Funny how none of the other ones changed though
Don't write su!c!de write su¡c¡de
“You know what, let’s be friends” “No”  “Yes”  “I Don’t Know You Please Go Away” “You don’t have a choice”  *Cause Of Death: Ian Boggs*
Aw so kind
plot twist: he listened when he said no
The reminds me of my dad who is resting in peace
That's what I want more than anything
Dude I got a power I can shoot water out of my sosig
Fun fact:neither one of his series ended
The sound is sad
Nice and FYI cause of death means what it means it can't be changed just so you know
3:32
Great job
Hey Ian your my favorite youtuber!!
Good thing you decided to be his friend
That was wholesome I like the change from the usual
It’s always the same power
No YES
Beautiful
Iuuh
Mha In a nutshell
😁
this day was shit nou you make me smile tanks
When he looks in the mirror and it says aids
Good video bro😎😎👅
So sweet ❤
Oh my good 1M likes keep up the good work Ian.
What a waste of my time >:(
Bruh you just killed hundreds of people that possible lifeguard could save
The last...
Hi
i love this dude he’s either so silly and goofy or dead serious   lysm ian!! love ur work
Shorts YTers be like “H! Guys !ts Y@ B*y B@ck W!th @nother V!deo”
I like this kind of videos you make me but you know actually real people so I should like them
Is this power works on your ownself? What will happen if l look at a mirror?
When the fire dude shoots in water: Omg the waters on fire
That’s the most wholesome thing I’ve ever watched.
Ian be like: Shut up, I'm your friend. YES. 😃
Why didn’t i
Wow 👌🏻  Great video
If it was me I'd be making bags if u get wat I mean
2025
That part when they made friends made me smile because I have no friends myself. Until this kid changed my life when he came up to me asked if he wanted to hangout
The ending is great
I called the last one bro.
999k likes
999k likes lol
Woah that was so relatable to someone who herself was saved ..... And yes real life Ian's do exist my bff saved me and the thing is she doesn't even have a superpower (I hope so or that b!tch is paying)
How can this man talk before starting school
You did this joke 12 times
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹aww you change his way to die!!!!!!
P.O.V:how to make new friends :))
"No" "Yes" *I said no* *"I'm the creator of this POV, I'm god basically. I can make you live forever. PICK WISELY."*
2025
So sweet🥲
Dêatg
Bro brought a knife to a beach
Hello
wait, the new kids cause of death changed, his dad and the other guys didn't.
That’s nice with the last guy
At the begging a pun could’ve been made “thats lit”
Hmm...if it changed when the dude said No would it change if they were like "Ok if that's what you really want"
Yeah you do have a job
I like his smile at the yes
₩o₩
₩
~ fyggtgyyg~
"See how people die" "Isn't everyone gonna die at some point" Me: here we go again 🤦‍♂️
How does he not see how he dies????
U gotta be fucking kidding me why kids are using this sound
I wish real life be like this
How am i gonna die?
It’s crazy how one person can affect someone’s life so much
So uh- The fact that the new kid's was the only one to change means that everyone else is going to die the same way.
Frggccdvfct and other half
"You know what? Let's be friends."   "No."  *YES.*
Yolo
So awsome
this guy is the nicest person ever
Honestly that last part was actually pretty wholesome
d!e
D!I
Made me cry actually
See how people die is the best ability
Dude you were gonna make me cry at the end!!😫😫
Respect +
Good way to stop suicide
This is one of the most wholesome videos he's done.
Please do lightning for your superpower next and ur cool
“I can shoot fire out of my hands!” Me: BAKUGOU?!
Mha
He was mr lonely 😔 😢 😞 😪 💔
I would like to have Shapeshifting I genuinely would like it
This was one of your best video
This just made me cry! Omg it made my day.
That one kid who’s superpower is anxiety xD
He has this calming voice that makes me feel good all the time
That power is very useful
Ian I really want you to be my dad cause I do not have one😭😭😭
Did you notice that other's death cause stay same while new kid's cause of death changed? Yea they both gonna die to same reason anyway 😬
Car accident doesn't necessarilly mean that Ur in the car, it can also mean Ur walking and the car hit you that is considered car accident too
Imagine someone curves all mental and 9hysical problems, making everybody immortal(until they want to die). Then nobody has to die
No I'm literally crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭
POV: you look in a mirror  (Only cool people know what I mean!)
Love your videos
Omg amada the adventure  iam really scared 😱
Wait aren't you the guy from shang-chi
Love it
I guess this power makes you protect people from dangerous death ig
Too bro Ian I think you should grow a beard and mustache . A little tip to your channel, you should make longer videos like short movies it will be so much fun
Did he save his Dad or not?😭
I have been knifed in my head
Rip
I love you for this<3
This is the videos I like
MHA
This put a smile on my face
Wow

Epok ending
Frien till death
So he made his dad died but he saved some random stranger and his friend
Nice
D!e
Kinda sad vid
“ you know what”’ let’s be friends”” no” “ yes@
your face looks like asia mixed europe
Wow that cool 😎
"I'll be your friend, if you don't mind. "No" "Yes"
Do u reply?????
“No” “yes” “nO” “YES”
actually wholesome
I saw a meme of mountains and had a thought so I guess yall are gettin a random thought. When your climbing a mountain and an avalanche happens, it's the mountains equivalent of swatting a mosquito off our arm
yes
But the thing is, if you see how people die and you change that, then you didn't really see how they died because they didn't die like that.
Bc my life is bad and I’m a depressed kid who no one wants to speak to
I wanna go and do su!c!d3
It wors the rhigt fing to do

Suicide really affects me right now. I think suicide inside my mind.

Wait so his dad and other friend are still going to die by car crash and shark attack
My heart broke! Thank you so much for making these POV's. You make the day better
This video by itself is pretty well made but the nonchalantness of the character makes the video 😎💙
Part 2!!!
One piece fruit superpower POV when
Ok I know I’ve said this so many Times but…I NEED A PART 2
It says 911 likes lol🤣🤣🤣
Yr so nice I. A sub
Jesus states in Matthew 7:21-23: “Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of Heaven”, yet there are some who teach salvation by “faith only”, i.e. as long as someone believes, he/she will be saved. Please Spread the Gospel Before its to late i’m Not Joking
So he got it when he’s 2
Ayo Ian great news ✨    Autumn has Chad , Sarah is urs now 🤚😭
Day one of trying to get someone to like my comment
Imagine his dad didn't die when he asked to drive him and he dies later lol
It's not a mistake,it's a 💫 it's a masterpiece ✨
H.I.💩
The last one cheered me up a little 🥲
whoever thinks of suicide  pls dont ❤️
I love these
It's so wholesome
No yes no yes but why beacuse i say YES
*heart melts at the end*
😶
so wholesome <3
So wholesome
"you know what, let's be friends" "No" "Yes" "I refuse to be your friend" "I refuse" "Refuse what?" "I refuse your refusal" "What the-"
“Ayo😳”
No bullying
🖤
The music is from slime rancher
Interesting
This is so heartwarming it actually made my paralyzed sis get up and turn it off
If this was a power in rl this would be so helpful
Wholesome
Is it true that you're father grew up in Kenya
I had a insane POV video idea! So the government creates these 2 pens that can duplicate ANYTHING. Living things, phones, money, houses, etc. no one but the government knows who owns these two pens. You, and someone else. Here’s the catch though. Not even you and they know who has it, but they only know THEY own it. Understand? Kinda like if I had slime and I know someone in the room with me has slime but I don’t know who. So, when you end up meeting the person with the other pen you guys battle it out and you can rather kill them and take the pen, and duplicate more and sell, or become partners. The story is yours to tell!
See how people die weird
I can tell
Devin cahrley your copying
Hi I’m kenyan
Good video
This was emotional like honestly
The ending is literally how an extrovert adopts an introvert
I immediately thought of one of the emo kids that Mei had a crush on from Turning Red when he mentioned "the new kid"
This is a video that helps people not to be mean (;
Anyone could save a life all it would take is being there for someone no matter what
*[THE TVA DISLIKED THAT]*
"You know what,Let's be friends" Kid : "No" Ian: "Yes" Kid : "No" Ian:"Yes" Kid: "No" Ian : "No" Kid : Yes Ian: yay were friends now! Kid : wait wha-
But if only his changes would that mean all those people would die the same way
They are not humins
He is right 👍 everyone dies at some point but all of them live a good life 🙂🙂🙂🥰🥰☺️☺️☺️
Dude just saved a life right there
I knew suicide was gonna pop up
NFT
That is a cool super power
I have no friends and i am sad every day but watching your videos cheer me up, thank you ian
D!e☠️
i¡ ~
I'm fat and dont have friends
When Ian saves a life by 1 sentence be like:
Yes  Yes Yes
Why the hell is everything with fire 🔥!!!
Ian there are fake insta accs
New kid: No 😒 IAN: Yesssss  IAN: IF YOU DONT BE MY FRIEND YOU WILL BE A SACRIFICE
Ian:you know what lets be freinds New kid:no Ian:yes *smiles*(and i like how ian smile🥰)
Hehe
“You know what, let’s be friends” “No” “Yes” Me: luffy trying to recruit zoro lol
Fueco Fue Fuecococo. (So Wholesome)
I love your vids Ian
That is heart touching
"Suicide" So is this  a new kid suicide mouse 😳
The end aww
If this was like MHA I feel like Ian would be deku tbh
Ur vids r cool😁😊🙂
Love how he just saved a suicidal person
Why d¡3
😭🙂
I want power
That was sooooo. Sweet!!!!!😃😃😄 Like so sweet
But the dad and friend's never changed.
Ayo😳
What essentially happened to me, I saw the fate that befell someone if I didn't intervene, so I did, they then became my best friend, like a brother to me
i liked because he dies form a shark attack and sharks  are my favorite certures
Bruh u ha e a higher chance to die from a vending machine than a shark
I want to die
This just shows if you take the time to get to know someone, you might just save them. Wonderful lesson Ian
But why just before they go to school is it a new one everyday damn that school must burn down a lot if so
Aww ur so nice friend 😊🥺
Hey the new kid so weird he's the guy who's protecting all of you so shut up

He was so depressed that he almost committed su!c!de-
I luv it!😿
Good story
Final destination vibes
that's just mha?
This was really wholesome
Im just like that kid weird person
Respect
*That moment when you realize the cause of death for the first 2 people didn’t change*
That's what we need more of caring people
This power can not stop death, only delay it. So it can only stop short-term death. Edit: just finished the video, turns out it can. Pretty op power.
Why are we scared of death when it's inevitable...                              - Tubbo
Cool
😀😃😀😃😃😃😃😀😃😀😃😀😃😀😂😃😂😄😀😃😀😃😃😃😀😀😀🙋🙋
No yae
it actually shows in the end that the death changes, so it might be that his dad still crashes and dies, and the lifeguard guy still gets eaten by a shark
he changes the depressed kid's one. but the rest didn't change.
What's the difference between i and ¡
What's your power
I cried the first time
Yep sometimes all a person needs is a friend.
Can you make about Cosmic Manipulation superpower
Good guy
Dang he letting his go down alone
Second part pls
The question is, would you actually do that for the new kid.
How do you say wake up in Japanese?
This video is so meaningful in some way to me
"Let's be friends" "No" "Yes" *music intensifies* "You thought you had a choice, huh?"
This is wholesome <3
POV a flesh eating virus been braught into school by a kid named beau, then while you were messing around with a fruend you hear the teacshers asking him whats wrong and he says "beau, flesh" then ge drops to tye ground. you both run into the bus parked atbthe front of the school, and get taken to the fbi building....to be continiued
What if he looked at a mirror
😂🔪
Okay that was cute
part 2 pls
You look like shangshi
Ian honestly seems like such a kind hearted, pure person.💛💛
Changing fate is really something very risky to do though  Edit:But saving someone is really are superb move
This is wholesome
His dad's  death and friends death didn't change so he didn't do anything really
Modified
He is a saint he saved lives
RESPECT
Does that mean he didn’t save the others?
( me in the corner singing we don't talk about bruno )
I like what you did
Èeeeepppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccc
Awh the last one
that new kid was me. just tired of life☺️🙁
Ē
Doesn't the person who said he can shoot fire from his hands remind u of boom boom boi?
Sad
:)
Nice
Hi Ian
That ending is so wholesome
One actioncan change someones life
For anyone's that's confused, he can probably see how people die and unless he prevents it somehow, then how they die might change. Just what I thought tho
I want that power
Die = a!p, turn our phone up side down to read it
Bruh you have more chance of getting hit by ligtning rather than being killed by a shark
This is literally the same thing. Be more creative Ian bogo mogo.
the musick
Wait, so the first 2 people will inevitably die to that cause of death, since it didn't change?
I im ober2
I wish it worked like that, good sentiment
The only time the death cause was chamged was in the emo kid sp all others still died
That... made me cry
😔
🤨
So wholesome🥺
please do a part 2!
Thanks, man! I'm experiencing depression right now and I need someone to talk about anything! I dont even know why I'm feeling this shit!
Why does it have to start school
The talent..... U r just amazing
I just learned something:  Asking someone to be friends will *completely* change their fate.
“No.“ “Yes.”
Yes
love this one
I cired
The only one that changed was the suicide guy.
This wholesome. It reminding me of anime song that mean someone want to suisde but someone be freind with her and stop her from suisde. 😁❤️
👍👍👍
Im on verge of tears at the last part.. can truly understand that..
He stopped the guy from commiting suicide 🥺🥺
These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better 💞
Jesus Loves You and Jesus is coming soon 🌺 Even if you feel unloved, remember that there will always be a Heavenly Father that will always love u 🍄🌿
I feel warm :D
Aw that’s cute
We need more people like Ian on this planet I know how suicide feels and it hurts People like Ian can really make a change on this earth who agrees
THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP IS ETERNAL
The last one hit me so different emotionally
So in this video kids can get their power at kinder garten
Lol death spelling is wrong
The number of lives a person could save
A hero doesn't need quirky power, just need a big heart
I think i'm the kid at the end
D!e
That last one touched my heart ngl.
Always be kind. You never know what someone is it going through.
Oh my god that guys a fire bender
"See how people d!e"  Me: HAHAHAHA NOW I JUST NEED A DEATH NOTE BOOK
Part 2 please 🥺🙏
Death can be changed, guys. The future isn’t set.
His power made him a hero 3 times in 1 day.... 🥰
He became Mirabel
Thx for great content :D
Everywhere you go to you can find a friend ☺
That was nice
He has done 5 of these
Thats nice
Love it especially the last part harry felt
That last part made my day
The most profound TikTok I've ever watched ... Thank you, Ian!
That kid reminds me of me and one of my classmates The words “Just go away like everyone else” hits so hard it just makes me So sad I wish there were people like that helping people who need it you Have no idea what people are going through so their is no way anyone Will know what’s happening only the people who have been through Tough times understand being healthy is being happy and if your not Happy you can’t focus on health and you will live Less longer this video is short But it’s amazing never stop this Ian you are a wonder keep going going and going And if anyone is going through a tough time remember that  1. Your not alone  2. It could get better    3. You are your emotions   4.happy=healthy a lot of the time

Ngl that maybe me cry a bit because I'm in need of someone like that but it seems like no one listens no one will probably even read this but for the one that might always care about others and treat them nice and with respect you never know what someone eles is going through
hey son i can drive you to school today iann:im gonna let you die
Honestly that’s a really good power even prolonging someone death for as little as a year or more is still something
Wow...Superpower like this....Wonderful....I too like to have this...If I'm able to save someone's life ....It Great....🌟🌟
I love your content even without sound effects and music I will still LOVE YOU😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘❤❤❤💕💕💕💖💖💖💗💗💗💙💙💙💚💚💚💛💛💛🧡🧡🧡💜💜💜🖤🖤🖤💝💝💝💞💞💞💟💟💟💌💌💌❣❣❣💓💓💓

You're one of the reason of rising world's population, in just a minute you saved 3 people lives, in 9 hours shift you're saving 1620 lives.
i saw the same thing but another person
My man just changed the future 3 times
I LITRWLLY KNEW HE WAS SU1S1DE OMG
Very wholesome
Oh man I remember when I was the new kid. It’s so stressful. And I’m my opinion its hard to make friends in my area. Unlike in California, Texas is so hard to make friends :(
If i had this superpower i would try making a fortune. Lol
The last one was so kind it made me cry
I will Walk to school today.His father proceeds to die in a car accident
Fax
to easy
Its OKEH to not make a mistake (titan cry 😭) Its a mistake ✨ ITS NOT A MASTERPIECE ✨. Ayo 😳, who here likes Minecraft? Its not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨. Its not a bedwsrs mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ⭐ ❌ its not a joke, its a hazard ✅. Wow its not a mistake, Bake is a masterpiece.
LEO
Life saved
Lol he make like 100 of video power with how people die
The shark attack one never changed 💀
At the end
Motional ; )
Plot twist: his dad dies in a car accident on another day and nothing will happen today
The new kid:no. me: *YES*
What
Does that mean, because none of the others changed, they’ll still die in those ways, and so Ian did nothing?
There's a book called Numbers.its basically this
Always be kind to the people in need like the new kid
These shorts make everyone's day better 💕
These shorts make everyone's day better 💕
These shorts make everyone's day better 💕
These shorts make everyone's day better 💕
These shorts make everyone's day better 💕
These shorts make everyone's day better 💕
Part 2 please 🥺🙏
Nice power
V
If this was American school everyone's would have been school shooting by the new kid
You are the best!!!!!!!🥰
Made me happier
New kid is basically me being suicidal
If we think about it it's not really a power but is a curse that makes people 💀
I can relate the the new kid tbh
✨kind soul✨
It's not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
This is wholesome and all but his choices for the other 2 didn't save them because they didn't change to something else....
That was so sweet
Part.2
notice how noone elses changed😱😱
That is a power that can save people and that is a power that who can save everyone
TMRW I'm suciding see you guys in hawen😭
You know, that power is OP, and is really useful. The sheer utility of being able to prevent somebody dying in a certain way is kind of amazing. Like any other superhero, you can save people.
✨Its not a mistake its a masterpiece✨
The shark attack never changed 😳

Ian: *asks someone to be friends* Timeline: initiate ww3 with nuclear missiles
He just went "nahh bitch you ain't dying by your own hands your dying by HIS *points at grim reaper*"
This is what I wish for yet sadly also don't, everyone in public hates me just because I'm Russian •́  ‿ ,•̀  Yet I don't want friends because i have proditiophobia
What if he looks at him self?
do part 2 pleaseeeeee
This made my day, Thanks Ian!
The end made my day
That was wholesome
Bruh his is an copy of Bailey

My brother once said : "If it wasnt for the dogs i would have a kn¡fe to my throat" 🙁 and that just because he was mad  He also said: "Hey wanna play roulette"  Other brother: Don't say that  "😐 we can play with dads gun"   Note:he was older than me
Am I the only one who noticed this? If you look down at his name it doesn't say lan bloggs it said lan boggs!
Literally My hero acedamia
That would be the most terrifying and pressuring superpower ever but more useful than most for any ordinary student Ig
bro he got one power of the hulk so he’s half of the hulk
Never suicide but I have wanted to suicide sometimes but never did I hope I don’t do it again and I’m lonely :(
I love this it is so beautiful
Maybe he the new kid is the quiet kid and ian got friends with him and if the new kid plans to attack the class he wont attack ian
See how people d!e is the best power and can help anyone :D
PART 2
Need part 2
I love watching  Iron box sorry Ian boggs
Me scrolling through Ian's vids person asks me how long have you been watching his vids me: yes
Lan is a kind of good hearted💛💜💚💙
I know im late but you should make a part 2 to this
This is such an amazing and wholesome video Oml ❤️
What about the mic
That was close one, it's a good power 👍
It would be funnier if he said that thats lit for the fire
The ending is wholesome. This man is changing lives.
Ian: lets be friends!  New kid: no, i dont want to  Ian: YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
Only the suacidal kids cause of death changed meaning the others Will still die because of that reason
Its like an episode of DeathNote

I have a friend who use to be suicide, But I'm not sure if she's still suicide and even if she's an 8th grader and I'm a 7 grader, she's still my friend and hasn't done any suicide stuff yet anymore.
Me and my cousin calm it suopcide
Even a glimmer of happiness helped that guy
.. awe
Wholesome just like dadrock freddy
You coped the course if death thing
pls make a part 2
I honestly really need what that new kid got…I’m also the new kid, nobody really talks to me, and things are just really hard rn
"No. Yes"  *gives u 80 years of living*
I've felt like committing suicide cuz of how rough things were since 2020. Now I've met someone who knew I was thinking about it and she stopped me. In school. Ik I'm young but I have horrible thoughts about myself. That's why I'm the quiet kid in school I always just sit there, thinking of horrible thoughts so thank u best friend. (Not sharing her name tho)
You made my life better I don't feel lonely even though I have 1 friend.
Well, I would like to have that power
Wait bailey make this video too
hEs sO dEpReSo~

People are mean these days:(
Christianna
Wait if you saved the last guy why was everyone else still going to die from the same thing
Do what is  right 👍
Me towon
Wait a sec, since when he changed the death by stopping the person from getting in that situation, the death changed. That means that Ian’s dad and friend still die the same way, making his intervention futile
Pls part two Ian
Cat cat cat cat  /  cat  / cat _Cat cat cat / cat __cat
Plot twist: the new kid gonna be the villain
Ian do a vid like this but the power is all
This might be the cringiest thing I've ever seen lmao

I dont know why but this made me very happy for some reason
This man on trending

Cool
Something nice,honest and well done. A breath of fresh air. Thanks.
When he say "please be useful" then the power is appear
Shark attack dude still died because it didn't change
Plus
I love how the last one was SUPER POSITIVE. Super powers can be simply any form of human kindness that has the POWER to save and change lives.
gay
You got me smile
Best power EVER
This is one video I'll comment on because its so wholesome
Plot twist : quiet kid is 90
Good lord these are stupid
Aww, thats so sweet! This made my day :)
Your power was the most useful of all because it was in the right hands 🙏🏾
"You see the new kid by the way?"  "We have a new kid?"  "Yeah he's so weird"  *Cause of death updated to: School shooting*
how do people enjoy this…
Bro, my power is awesome. I can change the color of my eyes to whatever I want!
super idol
Ian thank you so much for uploading even when you are sick you always make great videos and entertain all of us. You are great always remember that.
These videos remind me of final destination but death doesn’t come back for his kill count
Pretty gay being friends with a dude JUST because he was going to kill himself.
Yay if I had a power it wood make rainbow  and Uincons I am young but o well
Pls do part 2
Hi
He's literally the angel of death
That was so wholesome! Omg
Pt 2 pla
Wawww 😥
I want my power to be teleporting or making a portal
Dhar mann video , emo kid gets friend. That's it
other than making stupid vides, he thinks his other superpower is giving head.
This was so wholesome. Maybe this kid has an awesome power. Now they’ll be great friends!
Aww
Dude that hit the center of my heart
wait but his dad and his friend's cause of death didn't change like the new kid's did
My hero academia in a nutshell
He basically has shimigami eyes-
I love this video and all of ur videos!! Also, congrats on 19th on trending in the US!!
The only super power that can change a person's life
That's nice save lives
I like how at the end he helps the quiet kid. He would have done something bad to himself if it weren’t for him. If we had more people like this guy maybe society wouldn’t be as bad.
Fake! You can see the text on screen, and there are jump cuts
My power is poop
Friend: saved New kid: saved Dad: ...
The fact that the man said No❤️ And he said yes is so funny 🤣

HOW WHOLESOME I AM ANGRY CRYING RIGHT NOW
I hate these kind of videos but I mean  if it's a way to show your acting ability idm
oops wrong again
i ment skitille chan
a little chan!?!?
Part 2 pls
He is so popular he had a role in a spider man movie
Sukses
Omg im the biggest fan
He saved someone else life
Everyone has a talent
This dude's content is like shoujo anime.
That's useful
Emm
This shows that anything no madder how small can change something like tuat
Ian is so strong all he has to say is "Let's be friends" and the person becomes friends with him 🤣🤣
Wait doesn’t that mean that peoples deaths are not determined that means that the cause of death he sees is technically not if it can be changed being more useless than being able to clean bacteria but it goes back to the spot i just cleaned
That was very sweet
His power isnt seeing how people die, he has the power to change how people die
this us a better version bcs u can actually see the change and stuff
“Jesus answered him, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.’” John 3:3 ESV
ITS NOT A TROLL YESSS
If i got that power first i will see me in mirrror
End of video: *dhar man pops up* Dhar man: We’re not just making story’s… we’re changing lives
420k like omg
I just caused 419k to 420k
What if the other kid can see when people die
The power you can see how people d!e its reminds creepypasta
This was the best power I seen!
TOO EASY
Notice how the last guy’s fate was the only one that changed? He didn’t help the previous guys at all
I love the last part 🥲❤️🥰
I started to cry So hard😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
tou made videos like see how people die like 30 times
awww how cute
this is so sweet omg
The new kid: dont talk to me you: 😁👉 let's be f r I e n d s
That laugh and the way you smiled at the suicidal person at the end made me almost wanna cry
I think it's messed up that you can't say suicide cuz of TOS.
That last one was so nice
Bruh u stole this idea
The wholesomeness is over 9000!!!
I love this short it's so wholesome and sweet. You did amazing and pls don't give up!
Ah that last part made my heart soar
Bakugo be shooting fire
This dude could burn the shark tho-
I love how he uses his powers for good and tries to change how people die
Imagine the new kids super power was the power of life and death
#18 in trending!?!?!?!!
i thought one of them was going to say “N/A” or “error” as he finds an immortal being.
YES.....FINALLY,  GOOD PEOPLE. TY!!
Aw that’s a solid plot twist💙
wait was that Kai at the beginning? Master of fire? No way!!!!
When he told the first 2 to avoid their deaths, their death reason doesn't change unlike the third one, which implies his dad and the lifeguard still died.
“You know what let’s be friends” No Yes.
Wholesome change
Beautiful! I love that, it shows hospitality, humbleness,  and this was super wholesome. It shows that you should care about anyone, that not even the rudest person should know what being by loneliness feels like.  And that everyone no matter what always deserves respect. Everyone matters. You never knows what someone else is going through. I am ten now When I was two, my parents divorced, because my dad was really abusive. He would hit me or my sister or my mom. He still doesn’t hit people but he was traumatizing. Then when I was seven, my mom passed away, and so much was happening so fast and so I was having thoughts of suicide. I tried committing it, but I used a butter knife because I was young I didn’t know any better. So I never told anyone and I did not realize how important feeling like that was, so I acted like it was fine. Then I think my sister was watching and now we’re best friends forever. I would offer my life for her. Then my uncle, a HUGE part of my sisters life passed away, and since I was now living with my aunt and grandparents, it was actually going a bit out of hand, and actually I told my therapist about this, and she said me and my sister have trauma. Only my godson and sister and therapist know about it. So please, if you ever see anyone going through something like that, please, Please PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, just be there bestie and stick by their side. Also, what is the background sound song?
:)
me when bruh
Wait the other peoples death didn’t change  👁👄👁
Ong these r always the same and so boring I CANT ESCAPE THEM ON MY PAGE THO
That Emo Dude Sounds Like *"Someone"* From CRK 🤔
This is wholesome. Literally
That legit made me tear up a little bit. So warm and wholesome. Nice one Ian!
Emo
I would love to be able to save people from dying
DHUT
what are these comments 💀
That was really good of him to do in the end.❤
I love the message on the last part
This reminded me of MHA, I thought he wouldn’t get a superpower, like Deku in MHA
Please please please put a trigger warning for stuff like this. I love your content but this stuff can be extremely triggering for people who have trauma with this stuff. No hate at all!
Dam man.. tugging on the heart chains with this one..
This was powerful
Wait... but if the new kids death changed when he became friends w him y didn't his dad's change
Please get this man in a movie for god sakes. This talent must be spread widely👏🤲
A bl story.
No but the thing is that you could make a company off of this charge $5 a mind read [insert name here]
Just realized his friend and dad atill die to car accident and shark attack since it never changed
I wanna die
Aw that was so sweet
Hi everyone  Merry Christmas 🎄
At this point, we can learn something from this. Anyone who's alone, be friendly, make friends with them. You might just save their life.
Imagine if it was having anime powers
Whats is editing app
this is fucking cronge
Okay how you changed the new kid's mind of suicide. AMAZING
This would have been better if All Might came and said "Eat this!"
Dēãth
The guy that started talking in the beginning is now a fire bender nice
He got the loading screen
This was so wholesome. Wish I had a power like that.
Dude I got my power I can shoot fire out my hands  Me : flash back : todoroki and bakugo
this remind anyone else of it and how the dead lights make them see the deaths?
These are getting better
If you got a superpower and you got to choose what would it be? (Comment down below!) Mine would be Psychic :)
Man I finna cry
Me: A suicidal person  My besties: Exist   Me: Not today!
That got very fuckin dark
This is so relatable
This is sweet
Ian rules
❤️
Such a powerful message.
Yoooo I love you videos
So sweet
His POV makes him basically deku
Damn, that made me cry at the end-
Death
Fire ball jetsu
Sorry bud that's not how that works
All these are the same thing do something new for once
That was so wholesome
The last one ... I think it's me
Where is the rest😭
This is honestly wholesome
That's so cool
At the end I know this is fake but you cheered me up. I wish my sisters friend Emma had someone who did that to her except my sister. Rip Emma you will be missed my sister always thinks about you. We celebrate mental health day and talk about how amazing you are. I love you em. 💙✨💖
def wanna see a part 2
Ironically, this is exactly what saves people's lives. At least more than the actual superpowers...
You know you should have looked at the mirror and you might of known how you would have died
THAT IS SO USED
Your coping bailey
I got transform that is my quirk
Lol
He saved so many people and that just warms my heart
I usually expect him to put a meme at the end
The new kid is a loser LOL XD
A kind Good man
No = Yes
He changed his mind that way being nice to people can make all type of changes
He changed his mind that way being nice to people can make all type of changes
No dark plot twists for once
Wholesome
Lets be friends Ok! I dont have depression anymore cuz someone said a generic thing! (Its a joke if you are dumb)
I didn’t expect the end. Sooo beautiful
Thanks for doing his friend  Because he was going to kill himself  Even it’s not real lol
I hate that loading sign
Now that was cool.
That's awesome it shows how you can try to help people grow and learn to love themselves
Always make respect to others!!!
Ngl telekinesis seems like a cool power to have
Wait if he didn't hop on that car then his dad will die from a car accident??
if we could actually do this we would be able to change peoples future and thats something good
That was hard to hear this it made me cry
The last one will probably be me
Wait if the new kid had a different death cause as Ian started to interfere with him, why didnt the rest of the characters have their deaths changed? Does this mean they die of a shark attack later, die of a car accident later in life. This doesnt make senseee.
Ur a life saver Ian seriously
i realy thought that the new guy would be kisame
Nice vid man
tHeY😎 LaUgH✨At😼Me🤡BeAcUaS👹iM🙌🏻EmO😏
⁰⁰ ^
Let’s be friends! No… yes!:)
This is like my hero academia
Forces someone to be friend ‘YES’ that other boy gonna be like ‘ok so mother uhm this person just forced me to be my friend I think he knows what imma do I think he has that power’
👍
The last cause of death changed but the other 2 didn't so I'm not sure he saved them
Now that's a useful ass power
I have one question how am  going to die
Shark attack!? That’s pretty rare, he must be really appealing to sharks!
Did he copy Baliey Spin cuz thats the same thing sbe did but the Middle she din't do
The way that ending made me so happy
Only Ian has the power to become everything in the world, he managed to save a life
Finally, someone shows how preventing them from dying one way will actually change their cause of death
The last one,I knew it was suicide by the way they were talking about him
You do horrifying videos
Horrifying
Lol
Love how he saved everyone but his dad
This is so sweet
i’m moving to another school next year and there better be people like ian there who just walk up to you
I love ur vidios
Aww
To beeeeeee honest who else is scrolline btw i'm not a bot and i'm one of those kids who want to be verified
PART 2 PLEASE!!!
I’m only the weird kid so people leave me alone they are annoying
This reminds me of mha
Wait, is his father and friend gonna die still in a car accident, shark attack? Cause those didn't change unlike the new kid's.
I can shoot fire out of di+-
I usually don't watch this sort of stuff but this is a pretty neat video
You look like shang chi movie character
Welcome sir nighteye
Wow lain
😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉😉
I cant say how much everyone appreciate you still uploading even when ur sick  Your amazing 😁
Can you do part 2
“Isn’t everyone gonna die at some point”  That’s me every single day
I have tried to kill myself twice,let me tell you,you can't just stop someone from committing suicide just by being friends with them,not even my boyfriend can stop me from harming myself,it's just not that simple
This is inspirational
I thought see how ppl die not know before they die
Unfortunately they will still die even if u try to prevent it, murphy's law essentially
How can he do it even with covid
It pretty nice BUT like sharks arent dangerous at all
What was he gonna use a rope a gun A KNIFE?
Honestly Ian, you could become an actor with the range of different characters you can turn into
Ian you are such an amazing person  If you're really not feeling too good and need to rest from the covid its perfectly fine! Remember, You can take a break any time if you need it 🥺💕
omg the last one really got me crying there we should all be friends 🥺💕
I love Ian no homo
how many times has this bin done
The fact that maybe you cheered up a lot of ppl with your videos, and that maybe you actually chaged our lifes for real...
You can't cheat death just by knowing it
Move the text some up bcz we can't read that for caption
This is the same as BAILEY ’ s vid 🤨
That is the power I don't want to get  Really I don't want people come to me how they actually die
Thr last kid is tamaki
Ian Boggs is so nice 👍
No
This just made my day ❤️
Omg
Shark attacks are so rare
Im sorry, but i must escape the matrix and be the first person with brain and standards here to say that those series are pretty SHIT. Its very uncreative and the acting is just alright.
Man, this is very entertaining 🔥
I wish I had powers give me power!!!!!😡
Your awesome bro
Hi
You bisy Ian🤬
and then they became bff
Can't wait for part 2!
I would love this ability to bits... i would try to hint people, but ultimately fate would lead each person to the end  Also i could make lots of money off rich people
Aaaawww the ending was so good love it
At first I thought the power would suck but no it would be amazing to do that to save people
Cosplay as Baruto
Ooo, love the new series
You can't stop a death from happening just because you know it is gonna happen. Time doesn't work like that
To everyone who sees this: Merry Xmas!!! Christ is born today! Have happy holidays!!                $9”8:-6
Hi lan merry Christmas
The guy joined the dark side and now he can shoot fire from his tips
I don't know why the end gave me chills, but it was so nice
And I knew.
I actually attempted to commit suicide but thanks to ian i dont anymore
The last on was cute
Please be something useful: algorithm: lol let’s give him the worst possible power ps he’s not changing the future he’s just keeping people away from their deaths which will still happen how he sees them
&*$^@&$&÷#&&$^#&#&#^#€£÷€÷€×£÷()
Take care during Covid, Ian, and merry Christmas from England!
God help ian pls God help ian
I hope ian stays well😓☹🙁😔
This is the best video I have ever  seen in your video especially the last part
Actually, his dad and his friend still died, since the only one who changes their death was the new kid...
Hi Ian I hope you are feeling WAY better 😇😁
Hope you survive Ian :( your my favourite pov tiktoker :((((((
IAN TAKE CARE AND PLEASE STAY SAFE YOU ALWAYS MAKE MY DAY GOD BLESS IAN 💞 TAKE A GOOD CARE HAVE SOME REST TOO
Awesome!
Ok... that was beautiful
U sound sad , hope u get better soon
Awww
Why is the Suicidal guy so much like me? I'm not even kidding.
i really missed this shorts🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲😫😫
Merry Christmas Ian Hope you recover fast 💜💙💚💛❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚❤️💚
I have basically the new kids feelings I have alot that nobody cares and everyone just.... and I think i'll be homeless soon and stuff
I want that power
Wow
I don’t understand he made the new kids death change but not the others? So telling his friend they weren’t taking hires didn’t change anything?
Next part
dude i get my new superpower ican shoot milk in my Middle finger0╭∩╮（︶︿︶）╭∩╮⌐╦╦═─
What an amazing message at the end
Everyone seeing the series me thinking is everyone's bday in te same date
This guy has to be in a shang-chi movie! He would be great!!
I like your video pls continue with your video
Hi
I'm in a constant state of mind where I'm switching between "I can't wait to see all of my cool friends tomorrow" and "I want to fucking die" I don't really know what else to say but, "Thank you, Ian."
This is beautiful :') Idk ehy but i actually shed a tear on the ending..
too easy
Hope u make series
Pt 2 pt 2 please
Ian Is the best friend anyone could ask for
So basically the dad and his freind would still die to the reasons?
Wow so how do I die
Very good ending😢
Is There Part 2?
Is This New?
If he can see how people die,there's nothing you can do about it cause even if you warn them like "don't drive a car (cause you saw that a car accident is the cause of he/she's death)" there is time like it can happen tomorrow or when you aren't there...but its ok I love your content btw ❤️
Are you gonna carry on with time u cam hear
Other power: knows how to reach the hearts of people in the best way possible
1 like for respect 👍      Ps: almost 1k comments lol
wow he need 4 mil
I love these videos I mean this one goes from well that's useless too oh my God this is f****** powerful as all f***
Ian is a very good friend to people
To anyone thinking it’s not that easy to make a depressed kid happy.. your wrong. I’ve been through a lot I won’t go into details because it needs a lottt of TWs but making a few close friends saved my life
Can u do more element stone's
Wait look the light and think its like sun and back screen its blue think about that
I like how he didn't say out of nowhere "you're gonna die at point blank thing" Instead he found  out and fixed it
Let's be friends No Yes 😂😂
You started copying too plz stop that's literary all copied you are my favorite YouTuber
My uncle died when I was 1 or 2🙁🙁
His friends power kinda is like from bakugou
We need a part two of the dragon egg
D¡
Ian is so kind
Merry Christmas Ian!!!
You Dare Change the Timeline You Mortal
Can you transform into kakashi Sensei from Naruto
Work work
Please do part 2
Aawwwww beautiful
The last one made me happy 😌
Nice
I know it's just a skit but it's so wholesome
I’ve heard this story but in a girl version
Istg I can watch his videos all day and yet not be bored! Him saving the depressed kid at the end was so wholesome
Ian has started making a wonderful series and now now everyone copies his stuff 😂😂❤️❤️❤️
Dragon egg part 2 pls
Can u make part 2 pls
<3
Do the spiritual healing thing it will look awesome
Also take care Ian!
I have friends but I have a few thoughts of suicide sometimes
i love this pov now keep going!!
The thing is in real life it's amazing how just being friends will change a person's life
Well I guess his dad is going to die because of a car accident still- and his friend is still going to die because of a shark attack-
can you atleast finish one series
You can die of a car accident just walking
Update on the virus please please please 🙏🥺
Hopefully you get better soon
"I can shoot fire out of my hands."  MUHAMMAD AVDOL?!
Last one word my heart
I wish i have this power in real life
Why i think that Ian kinda looks like Shang-Chi 😆
Ian take care don't upload for like a month pls so you go on with your career?
That's kinda cool
911 comments before I commented
just remember, sometimes you can make someone's life better by talking g to them.
Wait do u still have covid
Ian man, you need a break, take care of your health, no matter what we will always love you
I feel Ian rn he can't go anywhere either, because my family got the rona as well.
*{TARGET NUETRILIZED}*
The last one and with the song matches so oerfectly i love it
Please do a horimiya look with all his piercings and tattoos
Whaht.s your use
This is wholesome
I always now it's gonna be a meme xD
Your a banshee!!!
Fun fact: people don’t die of age, they die of diseases, sicknesses, germs, etc they got in their life
Pt 2 pls
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Why the new kid going to die of SU!C!DE
Everyone needs a person like you in their lifes'
you cant fucking change the cause of death lol 💀
Shang-chi that you
Fun fact: your most likely to be killed by a ball than a shark
MHA IS ALL I COULD THINK OF IN THE BEGINNING-
I need a part 2!
Im suicidal, I only have one best friend out of the entire school. And I don't talk much to anybody else, and I mostly get along with the teachers, principal and counselors. It's weird to think my life is good but I still get suicidal thoughts, and my thoughts grow into thinking of homicide. And I am now paranoid. I've talked about this with one of my teachers and my best friend, and some people online. I feel better often but it turns into a pattern to the point where I need to confess it over and over again because I havea fear of telling my mother about all of this (she doesn't know). And I have no way of seeking therapists or seek professional help cause my parents will be notified. And I don't want them worried, I feel way too overwhelmed so I keep a fake smile on me and try and be busy. These thoughts and feelings have been going on for 2 years, and this year I had just started to talk to people. Any suggestions on what to do?
"Isn't everyone gonna die at some point? "  Yes..
You have never finished the The Jedi and Viking and knight season:c
I want this as a series
Amazing, I'd really like a Christmas Pov!
I showed this to my sibling ( they are genderqueer) who suffers from depression and anxiety. They really liked this vid and it reminded both of us that there are people looking out for us. Thanks for reminding us of that, Ian! I know you might never see this but we are truly grateful for everything you have done!
Sometimes… I wonder is his videos entertainment or morale life lessons
Him: no Ian: yes Him: no Ian: *turns into demon* YES
So good
IAN BOGGS KNOWN FOR STOPPING KIDS FROM COMMITING SUICIDE
A few years ago, I had a dream where my friend died. Today my friend died. In the same way as the dream.
THATS SO WHOLESOME
E
Ever since he moved to the new House, he stopped uploading “Things You Should Never Say In Japan” 🇯🇵 🤔
he's so creative
See how people die is useful mine was to see a future and believe me or not it's true
Gotta have a part2
The "sucide" one really gave me 13 reasons why vibes...
That’s a nice ending
Get well soon
Ian r u 68?
10 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. 11 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. (‭‭Matthew‬ ‭2‬‬:‭10-11‬ NIV)
Wow
This one was pretty wholesome ✋🥰
I was always taught you can’t change your fate so maybe because you said those things led them to die like that
Part 2?🧐🧐🧐
What if you did one where you get to see how people die but you then find someone who doesn’t have a cause of death because they turn out to be immortal.
Final destination 101
That super power would be able to help many
Next part please
Hope you get well soon and thanks for entertaining us
No hate but it's kinda the same thing ever video
Shinigami power 🔥
When that dude said: No Me: having flashbacks🙂
Imagine if you have that kind of power. Will you save people from death?
You can always help someone 🙂 😌
Are you ok from haveing Corona?
That's using your power for good. Beautiful.
WHY DOES HE NOT HAVE A NETFLIX SERIES YET???
This made me cry- 😭 Your acting is amazing, and so are you
Imagine the kids power is loop and they just keep saying  Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes
Ok, but that was so sweet how he tried to save everyone ;-;
I Suffer with depression and suicide
Yay you prevented someone from committing self-die
Why does this remind me of gaara XD
Chile anyways so
The last one warmed my heart.
🥰🥰🥰😇😇😇😇
Pls tell me that I ain't the only one who thought it was trees 😭💀
This is the exact same video as Bailey spin-
Hope you feel better from your video where you said you had COVID stay safe!
My friend had a suicidal friend that died years ago when i never met them as my friend is clingy and always checks up on me :)
Ian how did your Covid test go?
"See how people die" "Everyone's gonna die anyway🙄" Smartest man I've ever met
The first one: forward march and here we go, members of the agency bakugo
stop you're twisting reality
Happy Christmas eve
Ian is the literal incarnation of the fourth horseman of the apocalypse
His dad still died of car accident cuz it never changed same with his friend that got life guard
These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better💕
Just saying, no one else’s changed
I remember another youtuber says the same words and is the same but still is good
seen this idea from bailey spinns (whatev the name is)
Keep up that positivity
THANK YOU!!!
This man has infinite ideas
Your du best😄
HAPPY 3M IAN❤️
first time ive cried over a pov wat in the world
tik tok when the kid dies:OH NOoOoooOOOOOOOOOooooOOOO hE!!!! cOOOmmmmIIItTteed sUUkkIIDDDD            also why is everybody sukikidal
Don't wanna sound bitter. But...  I know friendship can have a strong power to it. But in reality...thoughts and feelings around suicide won't just go away the second someone tells you "let's be friends".
Since you got Corona i wonder what your family think about it
Can u post a full video pls🥺🥺
Nice
Awwwwwhwhshsjahsjshs
The last one is so heart warming 😍
I can fly in water :>
covid cannot stop this man from uploading videos what a legend
(°o°:)ᴼʰ (๑•ᴗ•๑)♡ aww
I love your videos
Cool
No yes
Wait by that logic shouldnt the dad's cause of death change? I guess he would have died in a car accident anyways
I remember this from someone
That is very inspiring and you reminded me to do good things. Thank you so much
MY HEART-- AAAAAAAGHHHHH THAT ENDING AUGHHHH.
Sabes Ablar En Español
Where more apex hunter series
Okay but he looks like the main character in “Shang-chi and the legend of 10 rings”
This is actually a nice one
I know that this is just a skit but we can definitely learn from it you don’t need to see how people die to know how they are feeling it was pretty obvious that the new kid was depressed.   What Ian did was very brave and actually saved a life if it wasn’t for Ian then everyone who interacted to spread rumours around would have been the cause of a death  If your reading this then I hope that one day you will use this message and help save a life too all it takes to stop someone from committing suicide is saying let’s be friends that’s all someone needs to have a sense of love or attention
This this was amazing
Pin me!
😊
Hope you are over covid and if not get well soon
Bro he can shoot fire out of his hand HES BAKUGOU KATSUKI
Ian how Japanese people eat ramen
I love this
SIR NOT D!E DIE
You why are ok 100%
AAW
"You know what, let's be friends" "No" "Yes" "Dude no, I don't even know you" "You think you have a choice?"
I love this video
Merry Christmas 🎁🎄
What did you get "Covid"  This is a joke hope you get well soon buddy
Awwwww😿😿😿😿😿
Have you heard of the bus 🚌 bus
PLEASE GIVE US PART 2
If i can see how people die my only option is to try test my family how will they die
WOWOWOWOWOW SO FUNNI  the definition of depression because we’re all gonna die and our lives will end so it doesn’t matter what we do which means morality doesn’t exist and since morality is different from person to person it would mean that feeling for morality wouldn’t exist so death doesn’t matter in life, nothing matters, so just begin early and commit suicide
"no"   Ian : YES
“isn’t everyone gonna die someday”  Me being the inspirational person that tried to help people not be depressed:  SHUT YO B*TCH A$$ UP
Moorre titan videos
POVS
I don’t really like pics but this one is interesting
Do you still have covid?🥺🥺
Hey Ian I have a question are you doing ok?
Let’s be friends
Dude: i can shoot fire on my hands One Piece Fan: AYO THATS ACE POWER KILL HIM!
My gosh this almost made me cry.
His friend is a fire bender
These shorts are so entertaining they always make my day better❤️
555555
Ian is literally trying to remake my hero academia at this point
If it was real you'd be a hero
Who ever reading this God bless you
Take care ian!! I love your content i hope you will be ok!!
❤️❤️❤️
This is kinda edgy
Yoooo 🥺🥺
Wholesome 100
Ok, that end was wholesome. The start was a bit dark but the end was cool
What does Chad look like
Good job Ian! Take care of yourself also Marry Christmas
❤ Loved this one.
Like the one at the end it was warms my heart cuz it's like a new kid and like everybody hates them for no reason and then always warms my heart how it's like even saying hi to somebody or just become friends with somebody even if you don't talk to them every single day like talking to them like once a week it can save somebody's life.
Ian  where's Sarah why she the main villain an super spy and all that 🤔
How exactly does he see these things by looking up?
*looks in a mirror*
The last guy was the only one who’s changed. The rest still die
I wanna have fire superpowers
It was so wholesome how the cause of death just changed because he made a friend.
I'm not crying you are crying
I love how his dad still dies from a car crash and his friend still dies from a shark attack but only the suicidal kid's death changed
That warmed my heart
What is the song in the background?
DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE COVID?
You are usually really active in your videos did something happen I am worried
This actually had a wholesome ending, I thought it would be like Death Note or something.
I'm prob gonna die of the last kids first cause of death before U befriended him 😔
👋
I felt something when he said suicide cause i was this new kid for all this year and i was  a self harmer for along time but i got better with time throw away everything i used to harm my self with and got close to some ppl i hope that suicide get out of this world 💔💔
🍎🦒
Always support people when they are down don't let them kill themselves try to help
I think there is a secret message for this vid, it’s just talking to someone can prevent them from taking there life
How many of these have you made???!!
This had me crying they almost died
You should do one where you can stop time
I want to have a conversation in the comments lol
This is a joke but  We need more people like him not ian 😀😖😖

Here’s a good idea maybe and look into the mirror and sees how he dies and he doesn’t like how he dies so he tries to change it
It was very insensitive because if you think about it,he’s making the guy be his freind
Bro your acting is so good! Keep it up.
I refuse that you refuse I refuse that you refuse my refusion
Aww this is so good
This actually made me a bit emotional. Ngl
With this power you will be saving peoples lives. Literally, you’ve already saved like, 5 people in this series
Love your videos ian
Awww
It changes me: yeee
Awww
POV it”s december 21
That is so useful! I wish that I had that power! So I could save anyone that love so much!
Him: thets be friends.                                           New kid :  …..                                                          in his head: now I have a friend                            Me spying: 😉
Part 2 pls
It’s the fact that it’s so true,people ignore and judge people before they get to know them.They hurt peoples feelings or use them they don’t stay true and it damages the person more than they think!Take a moment to let those words soak in.
Wow this is wholesome and has a great message!
Woahhh cool you even take care of the new kid thats good for him
This makes me wanna die
I honestly really love his series 💕
why do you replace the i with a !, and e in death with a 3, totally unnecessary
To eazy
The new kids voice is so calming lol
Imagine how good this is going to be(^_^)
aww
Imagine if every single person he looked at will die by an explosion, burn, or get crushed. Do you understand what I meant?
Aaaaaaa the ending 😭😭 I loved that, it makes me happy
If u see how I die its the last kid suicide
Awwww 🥺🥺🥺 I wish I could see my best friend, haven't seen her in a while...
Put different videos I'm sick of these superpower videos be smarter
Mha
Part 2
I love these so much.  Makes my day..
Wow the last one is so wholesome 🥰
Nice
I watch your videos all night
That suicide one melted my hearts  when Ian said let’s be friends
So ian how is the freind going
Just by saying afew words he made one less suicide 🥺
Man just changed a life
The depressed kids voice just does something to me, and it like puts tears in my eyes as being someone who understands those feelings—-
I hope this becomes a series
this shows that one act can change a persons life
Wow that's awesome
Moral of the story : ''LETS BE FRIENDS" these simple 3 words can save a life! 😊😊☺️☺️  Be kind towards the sad and lonely people. You might save a life one day.  This actually made me smile. 😊😊
Guess what would be a great superpower?                              Shooting laser beans out of your eyes.                                    Yes, I said beans.                           And if someone gets this power,  they shoot out of YOUR eyes. Not theirs.
Die, Death and Suicide. Funny words
That’s so wholesome. Love the vids Ian!
❤️ Always help others when you can ❤️
NO F1CKING WAY
My dream power is able to summon bread out of thin air and throw it at people do to extra bread damage
Wholesome vids are the best
I love this
Guy: dude I got my power I can shoot fire out of my hands!  Me: Bakugo!!! 😍
Thats so CUTE
Pls make a part 2
"I can shoot fire out of my hands" Todoroki that you?
Aw that's sweet
You are the best I like you ♥💕💛
U made my day
You are the bestttttttttttttttttttttt I like
<3
The last one brought tears to my eyes
I really like the more emotional and "mature" content Ian has been making recently!! I always loved his content so much but his new stuff is so incredible!! I hope your feeling better Ian!! Your working hard, thank you ❤
I like how all the pov creates silently agree to use eachothers ideas 😂
Hello boggs
It's not a mistake ✨ it's a masterpiece ✨ we the jellybean army Will tale over YOUTUBE!!!!
He's been looking so exhausted after getting covid☹️
That ending was so good, it would've been so sad if he didn't care
I like how he saved everyone .
While this is wholesome, the other two causes of death didnt change, meaning that they still die that way
These shorts always make my day better ❤️
This is the 6th time i watched this, i can't stop 😢✨
This is like mha
Ian's only 4
I wish it was that easy to make people not suicidal
When he said I can shoot fire out my hands-  that gave me shoto todroki vibes 🧊🔥
Quick theory, What if all of Ian's videos are just a look into all of his different multiverse variants 😱
The last one changes, but the first 2 don't, meaning he didn't fix the first 2
I love this one!!!!
The simps care about skittle-Chan I care about the guy getting the beach life guard job
Bit stupid how the person who is going to kill themselves is lonely and sad. Kind of stereotypical
I like this one this most do far
Stop copying peoples ideas
Calling It Right Now One Day Hes Gonna Be in a Netflix show
So calm about his dad dying
Part 2 if that’s ok
Well trying to prevent it is useless because it tells you a 100% chance of how they’ll die so you can’t prevent what is going to happen.
This was copied from someone else
They are gonna be really good friends ^^
Love your series Ian! I’ve been a subscriber since you have had 15K it’s been amazing to see your journey! 💕
Ian is the best pov
What about your dad he's going to die of a car
This teaches a life lesson not to bully you might not see it in the person you bully but it really hurts them and I can cause suicide
See how ge managed to change the new kid? I guess his friend and dad were going to die anyways:[
That's sad.....😶😑
I need to watch the whole series
That last part… 🥺
You really could save a lot of lives with a power like that.
This end was amazing 😢👏
i love the music
100k like!
I literally went from mindlessly watching, to instantly emotional and crying when he did the suicide one. My brother died by suicide and people don't realize that 1 small thing really can make a world of difference to someone. This is why I make it a point to be kind to people everywhere, even if they're not kind back. If they aren't, it honestly probably means they are going through something or having a bad day and your interaction with them can change their whole state of mind for the day or even longer.
i whish we. van have powers
Part 2??? :)
I love ur videos Ian!! But try to get some rest u look very tired😪 and ur voice is a little low (NO HATE) For all of us please🙏 take at least a little bit of rest I want u to feel better hope u have a great day 😁
So wholesome🥰🥰
Oh god, the new kid was gonna turn into Rorochan! 😱
What are is this are we in the noku no Hiro acedemia now
"isn't everyone gonna die at some point" Geez, that got DARK
I really loved your video
Awwwww
Omg the other guy is irl endeavor
As a formerly suicidal person, I really appreciate you. Thank you for this.
Hey when is part 4 of how long you can hear coming?
Love the end
My parents say that YouTube teaches you nothing but I learned that you can change someone’s life by saying hi
Plot twist: only the last dudes death changed but his dad and his friends death didn’t change so they are still gonna die from that-
He saved the life of a new kid 👌👍
Notice how the other deaths didn't change...
That ending was wholesome
sky high: revised version
Ian: comes to know Dad can die due car accident Also Ian: I will walk off..n let's dad go & drive. 😁
私はこれらのシリーズが大好きです！ <3
wait if only the last one changed does that mean that his friend and his dad's fate remains the same?
I did this with the new girl in my class and she’s one of my best friends
This gives me mha vibes
Can u do one of the pill but u get anime powers like for example 9 tails one for all infinite void and titan
That's so nice!!
Congratulations you have gotten the wholesome ending
you could make a fortune off of this power
You should audition for a show on Netflix
Duuudee his vids r too good but they r not complete u know the feeling of an uncompleted story or that big show u like watching but u don't get to see the ending
If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved Romans ...10:9
I saw a person do this before you but another person in the chat said you did this forst
i love you lan i the 1 fan
My man is unstoppable... Covid ain't got nun on him
Hi, ian. My mom has covid and we cant go nowhere i just want you to know you are my favorite creator on youtube, god bless you!.
Why do you sound sad today Ian? 😕
Chad points +100 for being friends with lonely kid
literally so heartwarming
You're so cool! I can't wait for part 2!
I love this so much❤️😀
Love it 🔥
Pt2
The ending was so sweet. :)
Ian looks like some sort of angry and torn apart from family and friends type of killer with the earrings
That is actually so wholesome???? 😳😳💜
one little hello can change a whole persons outlook on their life  i’ve seen it happen . so say hello to a new person today ☺️
The thing that this man is uploading while he has covid so we have content is just amazing take care ian!!
Can you please do a part 2 on the emotion BTW I love your videos
This man has covid.. and is still entertaining us 🙂
This seems like an anime, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
N-Nani?-  Iz diz gAy?~     COS IF IT IZ THIS IS GON' BE MY FAVORITE SERIES-
Why couldn’t he have just gotten the death note and CAUSE the deaths instead warning about them
Nice uploads man. Respect Level:100
Ayyy early
Part 2 plssssssssss and thank you😃
Everyone has a soft spot… 🥺❤️! May God bless you Ian have a Happy Holiday! ❤️🙏🏻
These things happens in reel life  In real life no one gives a fuck whether someone want to die or live
Love your videos
Awwww Ian is so kind and inspiring ❤️💯🥰
If u had to choose your own powers which would they be Mine would be 1.-strength enough to throw a rock with my finger and make it burn. 2.-speed that surpasses light. 3.-the power to reverse reality A.K.A revert to zero.  Next thing you’re gonna say is “is that a JoJo reference?”
Hi
Hi
:)
Love that ending
I can shoot air out of my hands
THIS IS A COPY WTF
Is this a straight off copy of someone else's vids??
Maybe not a good power to fight villains but there is a way to be strong too 100 push ups 100 sit ups 100 squats and a 10 kilometer run every single day
This is why u don't make assumptions
So wholesome
This is what people need to do 👏👏
I love how he dosent care if anybody being meant to him or anything its just because hebdosent want them to dies so heart breaking
Red
If she shoot fire out of his hands, wait what color is it, blue or is it read?
I need a part 2
Did u test negative?
I would love to get that power actually
Omg Sir Nighteye has been reborn.
:D
The ending was so wholesome ;,)
part2
Part 2
Is it just me or is the new videos so much better quality?
Bro why arent you resting
Aww, he saved the dudes life. Everyday heroes.
Bro congrats ian! U got recognised by many :D
This actually made me smile irl
I can watch this all day
CAN WE GET A PART 2???
That is a great power you can change every one’s life basically!!!
Are you going to finish the fire stone and water stone video please
Some people walk with the thoughts of suicide but we need to help them I know how it is to walk with they need lots of help or they do something they are going to regret look out for people......
What would happen if you look in a mirror? Would you see how you die?
The fact he wanted a useful power and thought he didn’t get one but got one that’s the most useful
The power of friend ship
Ur hair looks like shang chi have u considered doing a shang chi cosplay that would be cool
:-)
That ending warmed my heart...
Ian is always so heartwarming
The fact the cause of death only changes with the last character means the other two are still going to die by a car accident and eaten by a shark He didn't change their destines D:
Actually with this power can change everyone's life.
Please make a season of it 🙏
I. Love. THESE
Plot twist:He actually can't change their death
wait a minute... when he said he'll walk to school today his dad's death didn't change to anything else
God I’m stupid how did it take me so long to figure out that the colour of the peoples deaths are how bad they are
Screw tv this is my source of entertainment
no.yes.no.yes
Well me early
Love ur videos Ian keep it up!
I relate to the last person… and I wish I had someone to bring me out of my darkest places.
Well, that was nice
This made my day! 😻
Bro you’re literally copying Someone else
I'm not gonna lied I cried
I love how it changes  Warms my heart
The ending was happy
This video is so sweet
Please continue this series.
Wholesome

Just realize that all except the last one's cause of death didn't change...
Seeing ian's progress in acting litrellay makes me emotional and happy you are doing great ian we love you♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What if everything were to be real
TOO EASY
Note that everyone's death method didn't change except the one for suicide, meaning the shark attack and car accident will still happen.
U
amazing story
actually there was a girl who did the exact same pov on tiktok , you are great at keeping on top of the trends !
BACKGOU?
I love this:D
Nawh.. That's adorable
Ian if you see this pls continue this series don't give up on it!
Aww so nice the ending is amazing please do pt.2 of this its amazing
This made my day. As a suicidal person, my friends are so important to me and are those who keep me going. I'm glad that there are other ppl who value those who are mentally affected and be friends with them :)
Love these!
Lol
This was.. Wholesome for some reason
Good power
Pt. 2
At first I thought this was going to be an izuku midoriya character
Pin me?
The first guy is a wizard from clash royale
Ok this is so sweet, most of this trend is comedy but I like the idea of him actually using it properly
This man just saved someone from suicide. This is what me and the boys call a good man
How long does each video make and how many takes?
Part 2 plz I love your videos
I’ve been watching every video so far right now
Pt 2 when?
I think this was one of your best ones so far. Great job.
Awhh
early
🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲 that’s sad 😔
BEANS
Hi
The last one hits different . Putting your hand out for friendship can actually cure someone's sadness and can prevent something bad tht he might do 🙂
Hear me out, the loading circle is the strongest power, you can make people lag into the floor, and you can lag into invincibility, only drawbacks include possibly being billions of time faster than everyone and not being able to speak to anyone 🤣
Think about it. Preventing someone's death, only allows another way of death to come.
Part 2
🇺🇸America: we have best super powers. 🇮🇳Indian parents: belt🎗️ aur paragon⛸️
I can watch these series, all day long 💕
You see this, We love this We need this We want this
If you start one more series and quit it I will cry.
Whether if someone is bullied, alone or has a bunch of friends, you should always be kind to people, because you don’t know what they could be going through
That's not a super power that's just sad.
This one hit me in my ticker 🥺🫀differently. Thank you 🙏🏽🥰, Ian. I really appreciate you and your creative gift for telling stories in the most unique ways. Hope you’re recovery is going well and that you’ll get to spend the holidays with your loved ones. Please take care and have a lovely day. 🎄🤗💚🎄🤗❤️🎄🤗
Be safe bro!! 😁
i like this plas make more
I got chills at the last one.AMAZING IAN
This was so wholesome. Maybe this kid has an awesome power. Now they'll be great friends.
