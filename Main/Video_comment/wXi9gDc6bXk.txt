Small correction - I meant Toxic Boost Zangoose not Guts Zangoose.
Hey Serebii I don't know if you take requests but can you please update namona Bio and add Bea it's the only thing I like about your site please it keeps track of all the Pokemon that the rivals end main characters have plus Bea Is mean rival of Ash
Hey guys I found the torchlight labyrinthihe it’s right behind the coastal outdoor classroom. Ur welcome
You seriously should speak out against their decision to make all of these freebies/raids end before Christmas day. Don't they realize that these games are going to be gifted on the 25th? Maybe even after? Ending on the 21st is a fucking disgrace.
Double battles 🤢 I'm excited for the challenge either way. May even need to bring out my Paldea team even tho they're lv 100s, which is very cool
Double battles? Eugh. But i think I'll be okay. My team sans Ogrepon are all level 100 and everyone is hyper trained. I may need to not use my Chien Pao because it will lower everyone's defense except its own including the pokemon it's paired with for doubles
There are BP ? Battle tower incomming ?
Togekiss only appears in places where people are happy, which is why it’s not in this gen. Cause we all hate it in Paldea
cool sweatshirt!
With that in mind, maybe I won't try to get a new team for this DLC, and I'll stick with my level 100 squad
What an awful English accent 🙁☹️
Still can't believe I've been getting help from serebii for almost 17 years
I'm excited for the indigo disk but I'm probably going struggle hard if my Pokemon are not leveled up cause I don't really use strategy at all.
But the dinomoons are coming back?
My patience grows thin... thanks for the preview!
Did not know serebii had a YouTube channel. Well hella cool
i have one question      did you see any steelix or onix?
I want to use a full hisuian Mon team for this dlc, and before watching this, they are all at a flat level 75  After watching this video a few times, I realized I’m in for a bad time  So I leveled them up to 85-90, but I wouldn’t be surprised if I have to go even beyond that
Soo, still 20fps?
I only got Scarlet in September and have only just finished Operation Starfall and Pokemon League, got Prof Sada, filling the pokedex and post game and Tera Raids to do so looking forward to picking up the DLC to play over the Xmas period, just a quick question is worth starting the Teal Mask with a new team as my current team is mid 70s so i am thinking of benching them to play the teal mask and then brings them back in for the Indigo Disk
I'm very excited👍 I cant wait to play.😎
All good, all good.... but are you crazy?! Saying that it is ok if the second dlc still goes at 20 fps or less?! After ONE f****ng year of possible optimization, they literally did nothing to solve those problems! And for you, is this an ok fact?! Uh boy... Or even the fact that only some trainer encounters are similar to ogre trainers from the first dlc, with "difficult" battles. Come on, it's the SECOND dlc, after an entire year of base game + first dlc. We will literally arrive to the second dlc with our pokemon waaay over lv. 80 at least, at this point. We will literally destroy any single trainer on our path. It's a second dlc, EVERY encounter is supposed to give us at least a bit of a challenge at this point, not once every 20-30 encounters.
can't wait
Terapagos
Wouldn’t be surprised if Jaq comes to the terrarium and gives you quest to find the starters .
7:02 hello there!
some people wont even be able to beat this😂😂😂
葵ちゃん可愛いな
はると可愛い
はると
Joe. Babes. Take a deep breath. You started this video like you were trying to break a world record for speed talking. 🤭
If there's not some kind of battle tower type of offline competitive play I'll be mad
I can’t wait to get my man feraligatr back
Really wondering what the Indigo Disk will bring to the table next month. Some interesting information packed in here - especially that the mass of land to explore will be bigger than it was in the Teal Mask with perhaps more challenging battles! Thanks for the recap! 🙏🏽
Man I’m glad they brought back double battles. It’s always been my favorite part of Pokémon.
Wouldnt be surprised if they got some pro people to help make these challenging trainers in game
If lvl 88s will struggle at the E4, then I can't be more hyped. Just let us rematch them whenever we want, and I can see myself sinking a few hundred hours just experimenting with different teams and builds.
Wow more stuff to fo! This game has everything!
Damn the lagg😂😂😂 this game is the worst in preformance if all time
Dondozo and Tatsugiri finally have value outside of multi-player. Out of curiosity, did you get to see any of the new pokemon that have not yet been revealed?
Hearing it will be hard even if you're level 80 makes me happy considering that's how my Teal Mask playthrough team ended up around there even after taking on the Ogre clan and using all the exp items they give you which put me in the high 80s/early 90s
WAIT SMEARGLE IS BACK
i was hoping that we cold get new forms but like after this my hopes to get a new forms are down
Yeah gonna be real, skipped the dlc1 and this isn't impressing me either. Why can't they just put this effort into beloved features they removed like a frontier instead of story content and biomes. Like, we already had that. The double battles are good and all, but 30 bucks npc battles? Oh I also beat violet without doing any optional trainer battles. Safe to say I wasn't enthused with SV either
How many pokemon can you can catch on this DLC?
I wonder what is Locked in the Indigo Disk DLC if you haven't beaten Pokémon Violet game yet because I have a few Gym Leaders to beat and one Team Star Member to defeat!   I don't race through the games like everyone else does because I like to enjoy the Adventure so I play it my way besides the game is very addicting to play which I lose track of how many hours I have been playing which is why I take breaks from playing the game!
Hey Joe I think that Indigo Disk DLC has a plot twist like fans think that Terapagos is in Area 0 but it's not their but something else is there instead which the Indigo Disk DLC may have just Hinted that Terapagos is inside of Blueberry Academy!? 🤔😲👌
Any updates if they will release a physical cartridge with the full DLC?
I want pokejobs back from sword and shield they made level and ev training so much easier also I'm sick of collecting the stat reduction berries I always seem to pick up the attack and sp attack berries more than the defensive ones which is frustrating hopefully indigo disc gives us a more efficient way to train what brings these into consideration
7:02 i think there was forgot to edit something out
Least you can evolve and get the Alola forms in the DLC.
saw this on trending nice
Finally! A challenging Pokemon experience! I am not versed in VGC style battles so I had better get to studying!
Sure, this might be challenging but u got to admit 7 star raids are much more challenging
Honestly thought I had the playback speed at 2x when the video started
I do love double battles, I miss unova. Kinda wish beware was here tho tbh.
https://youtu.be/QRIpp0v0mls?si=D2PV5FPX3OAa_y-k
so my only question is are the levels lower if you have not done elite 4 (similar to how the teal mask was way lower leveled if you weren't post game for the main game)? i would hope so, but would understand why it would be a crown tundra like area that is just high level by nature. would love to be able to get a beldum lower level though
Sounds like it's a hell of an improvement over Teal Mask.
To make it a fair fight, they should have the Pokémon battling all at level 100 so we can’t out level them.
Is my audio off or is this dubbed?
I’m more excited now than I was previously about Pokémon’s DLC outings. This one by your explanation makes me feel they put a lot of thought into multiple aspects of the game for longevity reasons.
are you able to tell me if you can catch the electric/rock type geodude in the 2nd DLC?
If the dlc is already done why are we forces to wait till mid December when they said dlc2 was supposed to be out mid November
❤
❤❤❤❤❤
I am a bit sad that there doesn't seem to be any kind of expansion to the tera battles, similar to what the dynamax adventure dens were in crown tundra. That was some awesome content that my friends and I played for a long time to get cool legendary shinies.
................... you're british?
I'm very excited to see more challenging in-game content. With the Elite Four providing a good challenge with level 80-ish mons, I think that leaves a good amount of room for less battle-savvy players to still complete the DLC by leveling more while letting veterans have a good time going in at the proper level!
7:02 - 7:03 You just did a midroll jumpscare. Was that intended or a software error? I was watching someone else's review of this video and I had to slow down the video to x0.1 speed to even pause it correctly, but dont think it wasnt noticed :P
I can't wait to shiny hunt
Double battles!!! YES!
Hopefully Paradox Raikou and Cobalion are available in december as well. Then maybe paradox entei and terrakion will drop february for pokemon's 28th anniversary or maybe they will be annouced then.
curse 7:02
I may be forgetting something, but I personally hadn’t realized that blueberry was in Unova. I’m really excited for that though!
I hope they have a full fledged battle tower. I can't stand the meta online with all the pseudo legendaries.
we are all wondering what content is locked and how much
Did you see Aron?
this is pretty good gameplay and it only further raises my excitement for the Indigo Disk. Of course I always make sure to never have high expectations.
MY thoughts are that you're the most violently British man to ever exist.
YES! I can get Expanding Force back on my Indeedee!  Also ALL DOUBLR BATTLES! God do I miss them!
The fact that it's in an underground bunker and everyone's wearing white reminds me of the institute from Fallout 4.  The one huge downside is that you need to beat the terrible TM DLC, meaning EXP Charm is a forced requirement.
I've been wanting double battle focused single player again ever since playing XD as a kid. I can't wait to try this
thanks for the video i cant wait!
Oh my god yes Im so happy Zebstrika is in the gaaaame!
What of ribbons, Joe? Spill the beans.
Is there a battle tower?
Its nice that you have to spend extra money on a full price titel to actually play the ral endgame everyone wanted. Well..
The audio is terribly out of sync on this video
3:46 Didn't expect them to put MandJtv in the game
No Nurse Joys?! SMEARGLE?! *ALL DOUBLE BATTLES?!* Oooh, this is going to be HELL, isn't it?
Another Dex to complete, and League to beat!
Very glad of the breathing space in the map!
It's in Unova so it has to be difficult. As long as we don't get the low HP theme lol.
Great video! You've put in lots of hard work over the years, you deserved to play it! 😄
LETS GOOOOO
300th comment
I am more interested in the Story after the events of what happened with Carmine and Kieran.
NOOOOO NOT SMEARGLE AGAIN
Break it to me easy Joe. Is Furfrou in?
Smeargle is going to wreak havoc and get another Pokémon thrown under the bus again, isn’t it?
Joe is a god 🙌  THANK YOU for the preview!!
As a flygon fan I noticed that trapinch is in the savanna and I’m ready to catch
Seems the DLC build of the game you played has somewhat better performance? Going off by the  footage.
If the elite four is hard and somewhat like the emerald battle frontier, it better have some banger music.
I just love your background!
The lore thoooooo ~ I can’t wait to see how it pans out with my new theory about Carl Jung and Admiral Richard E. Byrd!  That bridge with the rainbow gate and stairs at the end looks beautiful. Love the new flying ability for Koraidon and Miraidon and hope that will become an always accessible feature. Also if rock type Pokémon are weak to water then wouldn’t washing them with water damage them? 🤔
i find the lack of alolan marowak disturbing 😢
Awesome.
I am curious if you asked anything regarding the shiny sound in the overworld making a return?
7:02 Was that cursed video glitch at the mention of Curse intentional 😉.
He must be german 🇩🇪 amazing vid, congrats 🎉
Hopefully I can transfer my latios and lugia in the dlc
I really don't consider this to be the most ambitious Pokemon title of all time.  The SV and SS series really brought the ability to have competitive Pokemon easier but nothing really changed with the battle system.  The most ambitious one would be black and white in my opinion.
So can Pikachu evolve into Alola Raichu here orrrrrr?
him talking about how hard Amarys is     Kieran...
are they going to fix the performance and bugs ?
2D Pokémon games are more fun, have plenty of content, and look appealing.
Ah man, this makes me concerned about my team! Should go in with my 90-100 Champion team (+ Ogerpon) or keep the new 70+ team I’ve been training?
Triple axel let's go
Finally, a worthy challenge!
I'm so excited for this aahhhhh
Strong double battles? Vgc strategies? This sounds like Evice from Colosseum on steroids. I CAN’T WAIT!! 😆
As someone dipping my toes into VGC, this is going to be a fun experience, I have some fun ideas i wanna try out in a better way than just praying i don't get a legendary spam team on unranked or booting up Showdown
I hope for a battle towers/facilities to challenge the pokemon level 100.
AAAAAAAW Trapinch and Vibravas flying...and BLITZLE!!! I can't wait (>w<) Oricorio Pau style somewhat validates the theory according which the Blueberry Academy is built on an island near Alola but belonging to Unova (like Hawai'i or similar colonized islands like Iwo Jima)
Jump scare at  7:02
Ok, so it looks like the academy is using Terapagos as a power source. It'll be interesting to see just how maliciously it is being done. I'm also excited to hear that the difficulty of the battles is up. Given how much gameplay is required just to get to this, I definitely think it's appropriate.
Yesss my boi smeargle
one very small expectation I have is them having level 100 pokemon, like post game and stuff or as an option, which they probably will
VGC players might EAT this DLC in December
7:25 what was homeboy about to say about Corviknight? Apparently in some region...they evolve differently? Regional Corviknight in Gen 10 confirmed?
Im still hoping for for a more hardcore player experience
7:12 WHY IS AMARYS HAND'S 2 DIFFERENT COLORS?
I cannot wait to here some of this unova inspired music.
Performance will make it even more challenging 😅😅 💩💩💩  Remember when Nintendo and Gamefreak were sorry and promised to continue fixing the game? Pepridge Farm remembers😅  I hope the Paldea region story actually ends with twists and turns. Other than that I don’t expect much at all.   Double battles are welcome as I do enjoy the format
All I want to know is whether it has even one Battle Tower-like area. ...And it doesn't sound like you can reveal that yet. A shame, truly...
pokemon fandom: Scarlet and Violet is too easy! GF: And we took that personally
Does anyone know if Lugia is in the dlc
With the terarium giving Pokemon Colosseum Pre-Gym vibes, the emphasis on double battles, and the fact that there's actual challenge in the battles, this just makes me wish they'd do a proper remake of Colosseum.
I can’t wait to play and make a new team I hope in a trailer we will see the wild Pokémon’s levels
Is there a battle facility?
No Battle Tower? So no long time game contend? ..... why
평생 레드피카츄 88레벨이 끝임? 100대전 언제내주는데
they should sell product placement ads & vouchers in game
Too bad the game is still an unpolished turd
GOOD JOB!
This is dlc and the usual scam, why not be honest and sell it to us like gold? , well
1:24 so if we’re doing a Nuzlocke, we can only catch 4 Pokémon in there? If so that’s pretty underwhelming for me. On the plus side I’m very happy that all battles are doubles, being a VGC player and all
In case you missed it, the attacks he listed are: Skitter smack Meteor beam Breaking Swipe Scorching sands Curse Coaching Electro web and more  New moves include: Upper hand Psychic Noise Supercharged Cell Hard Press
Corviknight better get Hard Press, my boy’s gonna be busted again!
I'm very surprised to see the Pokémon Company recognizing Serebii finaly.
Looks good but what I can't wait for is the next generation game on "Switch 2" where I hope graphics and sounds will be at a much higher quality level (so tired of hearing the awful sounding pokémon cries which still sound the same as they did many years ago). Other companies making games for the Switch have made games which sound and look much better than Scarlet and Violet so it can be done and Game Freak should be able to hire the best developers in the world. Game Freak have been behind the top class game makers as long as I remember so it would be nice to see them as front runners for once. Pokémon deserve that - for once!
This sounds amazing
Man I always forget that you have a face
Alolan golem!!! That alone makes me excited
I really hope theres a Dynamax Adventures type of mode as a surprise so we can catch legendaries, and a proper battle facility!
Glad to hear it's a cool area with plenty to satisfy those looking for a decent challenge!
It’s probably a given, but I really hope Rising Voltage comes back as a TM. I’m not thrilled about Expanding Force coming back, but we’ll see how that plays out.
I'm glad to hear that the Elite 4 are a challenge, that's always exciting, but I wish they would do that in the main game. It's hard to ignore the fact that by now, if people have been playing the game regularly, even the most casual of players has a team of level 100s. If they would crank it up to that difficulty in the natural progression of the base game, I think that'd be great, because ultimately I feel like this elite 4 is still going to be a bit trivialized, and I don't feel like kneecapping myself to have an artificial sense of fun.  That's why I loved the battle towers/facilities of the past, and I really hope they have one in this DLC as well that offers an infinite challenge that is level scaled and uses competitive items and builds, hopefully not like the terrible one in the Galar region which always ended with a predictable Charizard.
Noooo that flying minigame looks way too easy i thought it would be a lot more fun 😭
No improvements in quality nor frame rate? Oh god. But great video bro
SMEARGLE
Dont know these games still don't look appealing to me. I wish they would just remaster the old games.
I can't believe we're already close to the second dlc!
Serebii the man!
Wait….. wtf serebii has a YouTube is this the creator of the site ???
Oh boy, double battles. I have basically never enjoyed doing those when they show up and there's no way that changes here. I'd hoped to be invested in the battles but now it looks like I'll have to treat them as a chore...
I’m sure the elite four will pale in comparison to Cynthia 😂
Will the rest of the legendary pokemon also return?
Thanks Joe! Great work here!
Something I'm really hoping for, but reasonably doubt they'll do, is include something like a Reverse Hyper Training where you can give a pokemon 0 IVs in a stat in the same way normal Hyper Training gives 31 IVs. That would help a whole lot with both Special Attackers in general wanting to minimize Foul Play, as well as help anything that wants to run or be inside Trick Room get the 0 IVs in Speed. It's mostly to help for Legendary Pokemon who want either, given the grind can be very hard especially with random guaranteed perfect stats.
Thanks for the preview Joe, the DLC sounds great
Holy cow! That website that i been using since i was 7 years old has a youtube channel!
They are LOCKING a DLC behind another DLC?! How scummy that you can’t play this one even if you buy it unless you buy part 1 also… Paywall GameFreak strikes again!
I love your accent
Idk why I'm just finding out that Serebii has a YouTube channel lmao
so no battle facility I am guessing?
So, what I'm seeing of these early test showings is that we aren't really going to delve further into the Area 0 crater, but just screw around at Blueberry's artificial doom dome.
If there's no battle tower-esque facility it's a waste of money
As a person who sees that TPC chose doubles as it's official format, it's about time they highlighted it in the main game.   As a long-time Pokémon fan who just wants to go on another adventure with the Pokémon he's trained up and nicknamed, I'm actually dreading redoing moves and natures of my current teams that were based on singles, or won't care as much about the new teams I built for doubles and need to invest time and thought into a new format I'm not used to.  I think it's a good move by Pokémon. But the learning curve isn't something I'm looking forward to.  Better now than never. But man, I wished they had made double battles more relevant once it became the official format.
I had no clue Serebii had a YouTube channel, I only ever thought it was the wiki
Sounds like exactly what my hunch was after fighting the Ogre Clan in Teal Mask: more real challenges. And that’s just what I wanted to hear! Thanks for sharing, Serebii!
I'm really glad there's gonna be challenging!
Serebii doing a great job. Proud and thankfull!
This should be interesting.
yo dude, your voice doesn't match your face
The info about the battle music references and other tracks sound exciting. Interested to hear them.
7:02 Joe Merrick jumpscare
Excellent preview Joe thank you very much for this! We learned a lot
I had no interest in the Teal Mask DLC, but this does excite me. Finally, a reason to properly team build
will the DLC has battle frontier like previous games?
Why are you a girl
I'm so excited about the indigo disk and I wish I could play it but sadly I don't have the dlc.
I'm just curious to see how awful the frame rate is again. I loved the teal mask but the frame rate caused major motion sickness at times for me.
Awesome sweatshirt!
楽しみやわ😆
I can't wait to play this, also I can't wait to transfer my Shiny Bliztle in, looks to be the same size as Mudbray here so they really are going to be shiny twins!
so.. new teacher??? 8:22
let me guess: Amarys has a Metagross?
This is awesome, I’m so excited for the Terarium and other features in the Indigo Disk.
O yay!
i would love to see a mainline game in double battle format. excited for this dlc
Any news on increasing IV’s and lowering them without using Bottle caps?
youtube subtitles are having a hard time here, me aswell lol
Quick reminder that a focus sash smeargle with endeavor can hit any Pokemon with accelerock or ice shard
I might use both of my Miraidons on the same team and give them choice items 😂😂😂😂
I was really hoping we would get a feature similar to Dynamax Adventures that allows for shiny hunting legends like the ones from SwSh which still have never been made available to shiny hunt in any way. That feature added years of life to SwSh and I still play it regularly. I'm worried after this dlc is played there won't be any reason to pick up this game again.
Sounds really amazing and my level 100 pokes are ready to play rough with these trainers 😉.
Goat this is professor oak… thank you lol
10/10
Peak Pokemon is back on the menu yall 😆
was there any repayable content like the dynamax adventures
Can’t wait!
This DLC is giving big Kill la Kill vibes. White uniforms, Blue accents, student elite 4
Based on your time spent with the Indigo Disk, do you think it is more likely or less likely that there will be a battle tower/battle frontier feature in the postgame?
You’re Joe Merrick?
Serebii Joe's voice is so soothing while at the same time sounding like a news anchor.
More double battles is great news. I always found it weird how there were rarely any double battles in the base game when Double battles are the main event for VGC.
Very excited about more challenging battles!
Dude this has me so excited for the dlc
Looks like scarlet and violet!
So exciting
Weavile is back babyyy
Really looking forward to the increased difficulty of this dlc! Especially so as a vgc player!
Thanks for the Preview Joe!  Here’s to hoping the BB League has Unlimited Offline Battle Fix that the Battle Tower of SWSH had.
Sounds like Kieran might get his revenge after all lol
Thanks for sharing! Much appreciation for all your hard work. My friends and I have been referring to serebii for all pokemon info since it became a thing.
I know it's a kid's game, but adding in actual challenges would be amazing. The past few games have been just ridiculously easy
JOE LOOK AT YOU!!! Congrats on this vid! So happy to see a fellow fan receive flowers from Pokémon. You deserve it!
Excitement! :3
Definitely looking forward to the main story being harder, and as someone who primarily plays VGC also looking forward to more double battles. Sounds like we might actually have some challenging battles for once.
I'm so excited to play the dlc!
I bought this DLC for myself but also my nephew. He’s 7 and has 2 badges. The Teal Mask DLC was a good “break” from the game since it let him level up and fight with Pokémon around his level. Will this DLC have the same curve? Or will a wild Blitzle be lv. 55?
Partner Pokémon? In the wild?
Can I ask you a question I wonder if Indigo Disk includes battle facility(battle tower, battle frontier) or not.
its funny how we're in Unova but it's a dome underwater that looks nothing like Unova and they easily could've said it was anywhere really.
Why do you sound like Bird Keeper Toby
You're talking too fast that it can be hard to understand what you're saying 😅 some interesting stuff there
thanks for lettimg me know i should build a competitive vgc team instead of a competitive smogon singles team, exited to try it out!
Holy crap! I didn't know you had a youtube. Been a fan and user of your site since I was 8 (now 33).
Great video, very informative as always. Thank you Joe for staying on top of everything
So that's where the postgame of SV ran off to
I really hope we get time distortions in the terrarium
What does Supercharged Cell do? You elaborated on Hard Press, but didnt elaborate on that
Small correction - I meant Toxic Boost Zangoose not Guts Zangoose.
I am sooo excited for this
well, i'm hyped
I’m actually begging for Pokémon to release this earlier
that's good news. thank you
I’m looking forward to this! I’m breeding an excellent duraludon in sword so I could transfer it to scarlet and evolve it
thank you so much for this early peak! feels like weve been straved of information for this dlc!
If it's in the unova region where are rotation and triple  battles.
Finally! A challenging Pokemon experience! I am not versed in VGC style battles so I had better get to studying!
Serebii, please tell me...at least a hint, are Mega Evolutions in there?!
Wait, you are that website!
The story is good??
I hope we get a new trailer soon, if they are already doing this with press people it mught be soon.
It would be so nice if they improved the performance, but I won’t hold my breath. Glad smeargle is back though.
Trapinch 😍😍
Too many Smergal jumpscares 😢
I’m excitedd eventhough I don’t place Kitakami as high as I did for SWSH dlcs I’m really looking forward to this. Especially the new hopefully unrevealed Pokémon and characaters since I think they’ve done a fantastic job here in gen IX
Bro mt first thought would be check the pokedex
I'm looking forward to it with my partner Cyclizar.
Yooo this is sick
I'm glad there's gonna be more double battles. It'll make training Smeargle easier.
He'll yeah
You know it’s bad when Pokémon company need to appease serebii 😂❤
Give me a set level 50 facility. Then it'll be an actual challenge.
So is this the final DLC of scarlet and violet?
I'm excited for the indigo disk
Hope they scale up to 100 for fights
Oooh it looks baaaaad
Thank you I'm so excited to play it
Can I ask you a question.    Is there any information about the past legendary Pokémon and if we can bring them/catch them?
Man, I'm even more excited now. This sounds like such a good time. Awesome to hear that the map is even bigger than Kitikami, too.
Yessssss double battles!! As a vgc player this is a dream come true
Definitely looking forward to what the Indigo Disk has in store! Knowing that you mentioned double battles being a prominent feature in the early preview is making me wonder how I should plan out my team. There's still plenty of time for that, though
Thank you joe, for your preview and thoughts! I can’t wait to play the indigo disc myself!
This was a good video and thank you for this. However for future videos I would recommend just slowing down a bit, your words are a mile a minute. I assume you’re reading a script and when stumbling over your words makes it hard to focus on what you’re saying for the viewer. You don’t have to record the thing in one take, split it up into segments and then edit together. Really not trying to be rude, this was a good vid, but I think it’d benefit everyone if you took a minute to breathe.
The way he worded makes it seem like Radical Red difficulty
Dang hearing this will be more difficult has me so hyped up!!!!!!!!!!!!
So exciting!! Thanks for providing us a peak, Joe! ❤
I wouldn't put plush toys on the carpet, they can pick up carpet mites that way.
You talk too fast
7:50 subject to change XD good one
v nice, very excited for this
is that a shiny golurk 0.24
Superman 64
Question! Are there outbreaks in this DLC?
You are incredibly lucky to try it out early. 😢 dude please teach me your ways.
Is there any hint of returning missing legendaries Pokemon?
The First one was really Bad imo. Thus i have Low expectations for the 2nd one
Good to see you taking advantage of this channel Joe. You definitely should use it more.  And a bit of advice for potentially future videos: Pace yourself when speaking. It gets harder to understand when you go too fast.
W vid. Thanks for the info. Can't wait for the release
@8:25 I doubt it, until the dlc comes out, I'm keeping expectations low.
Also new camera so sorry if colouring seemed off on my intro/outro
I can't wait to play dlc 2
聞きたいことがあります。 コンペボール、サファリボールはアイテムとして手に入りますか？ 手に入れば気になることがあります 入手方法はありますか？イベントやゲーム内で購入
Omg I’m so jealous that you got to played before anyway else
WHAT😭😭 I only listened on 2x speed and tried not to see much. This seems so promising!!!
so excited for the DLC coming up in 23 days left til I meet #terapagos  starting to love that legendary just now hope they will do a final trailer before it comes out weeks later?
❤️❤️
It's pronounced 'Tuh-rare-ee-uhm', not 'Tuh-raar-ee-uhm'. 🙄
Dude I'm so proud of serebii
Oh preview
A what finale?
