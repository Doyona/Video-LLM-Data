Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
FLOW ON THIS ALBUM 💿 💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥💥🔥2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣2️⃣💚💐💚💐✨☮️💯✊🏽

IMPORTANT ⚠️ 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.   2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16)  3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD  4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS & REPENT: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Trust in Jesus and repent (which means you confess and forsake your sins)

Jesus Christ died for our sins rose from the dead on the third day. We just have to believe know that we are sinners confess our sins and turn away from our sins and ask for forgiveness and for Jesus be our savior also to get baptized. And we will be snatched from the wrath that is so close. And make God first in our life and seek him with all our mind body and soul and the treat our neighbors as ourselves and we will be snatched from the wrath of God. Be blessed brothers and sisters.

Wow. Youngboy is back at it. This song is absolutely beautiful. The ravishing light-hearted rhythm united with your raspy and assertive vocals meld together to create a near-heavenly aura around me while I fill my ears with this captivating, beautiful piece of music. I am in complete and utter euphoria as I listen to this work of art. I can slowly feel all hardships I previously had fading and floating away into nothing but dust as I replay this harmony more and more. Mr Youngboy, this is stupendous. I am in awe of your unimaginable musical ability. 10/10
