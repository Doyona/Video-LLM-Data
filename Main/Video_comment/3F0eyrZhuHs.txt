Hope rick shroeder the hasbeen never sees any scripts his way ever again,pos i knew he was ,what trash
Murdering POS supported by sick racist
2 million dollars will buy a lot of bullets:  https://youtu.be/w4uMJAhbs8E
Andrew Coffee. SAY HIS NAME!!  A black man who was acquitted of murder the very same day Rittenhouse was. Police busted down his door without a warrant, and his girlfriend was killed....I’m not sure who else.  But ask yourself WHY is the media refusing to cover THAT story? Hmmm I believe it is because it goes against their lying agenda that they are spewing to keep their slaves enraged with ignorance so they will keep voting for them. Yes..I said slaves. Because that is what democrats are to elite democrat politicians. No matter the color. They need to keep you ignorant and divided. To keep you controlled. It’s been working for decades! When are you people going to wake up? 😳
Fast forward to now and he’s a free man
No all the Media says it was paid by militia and KKK and many other hate players. I guess that is also another libel suit to file. I had to find this out who did post bail, no one has ever said the truth. So many lies are spread in the world each day. People are so misguided, taht is how politicians get office, G U L L I B I L T Y.
Way to go Ricky.  👏
Makes me  SICK 😷
Mike Lindell, is a wonderfull man ! Sending love from New Zealand 🇳🇿.
"And trump supporter Mike Lindell" go F yourselves. Disgusting how the media is straight up lying about this kid. Prosecution withholding evidence and tampering with evidence. Unbelievable
#freekyle
God bless my pillow man..
It made me buy several my pillows…thanks for advertising for Mike Lyndale!
My pillow would like to thank you for free advertisement..🤣😂😅🤣🤣😅😂🤣😅
I love this
FREE KYLE, EXONERATE KYLE!
self defense lol. idk if that's what will be found technically, but if i was there I would have been scared af and probably woulda ended up killing way more people if I was getting chased and screamed at like he was (based on the video)...
I love Kyle he exposed black rifle coffe for being liberals
I'm only liking this video because you left the comments section open for supporters to critique the bias.  <3
I see all racist people stick together 🤣🤣
Free kyle rittenhouse
And I got a few pillows from my pillow good pillows make shure to buy one
This is a joke, there shouldn’t even be a trial. Free RITTENHOUSE! 2A is life!
IT WAS SELF DEFENSE!!!!!!
I believe that there are good people who do bad things and so on. As far as I can see, Rick needs, going back to his past, some mental treatment like the character Michael Douglas played in Falling Down.
It’s sad he was charged for killing that pedophile and man attacking him
Bigots endorses bigotry
They should've dropped all the charges
Mike Lindell YOU ARE A HERO!!!
One thing for sure:  Get a Trump-inspired 17-year-old running around with an AR-15 at a riot -- and multiple people getting KILLED -- IS GUARANTEED!!!!!
Ricky Schroeder?  How did Ricky Schroeder get involved in this?
Lower it to manslaughter and take his gun rights away
The ppl that got my back are former drug addict pillow guy this chump adult name RICKY (not 5yo Ricky, adult) Schroeder.
Non Trump Supporter and Black man here supporting you Kyle.  You were clearly acting in self defense bro.  You are the first man ive ever seen flee conflict holding a AR15.  AR15 holders usually welcomes conflict.
https://youtu.be/bRcgoegNy24 I feel like Kyle was in the right on this one and he’s going to get off maybe the most they’ll charge him for being a minor in possession of a firearm but everything else was self-defense
Kyle the real man !
Michael Lindell was not involved in providing bail for Kyle. He stated the money was provided to Lin Wood for work looking into election fraud.
Good. He acted in self defence
This kid is so arrogant.
Guilty > self defense on street for what stay home
“He should have stayed home”.   The rioters should have.
Critical Race Theory Is A Classic Communist Divide-And-Conquer Tactic
Self defense  100%
Jb another blm thug ... guess he won't be raping little girls anymore..
Anyone who takes an automatic firearm ... and crosses state lines ... isn’t going to do that unless they already have every intention on using it.  This entire ruse of “self defense” is a bunch of hogwash.   He needs to be sent to prison for 2 consecutive life sentences.  Period. End of subject
Keep your head up Kyle.
All I gotta say is dude did hella good. All of those people who were out there had no business being out there other than to cause trouble. I mean look into what they were there for. Its asinine that they destroyed the city over that.
Good for him!
They all can eat a fat
Bet his house is filled with mypillows
He was born to be a cop
How is my capital rioters doing?
How is my boy doing?
The guy had already committed a felony before shooting anyone since he was 17 and had a AR-15 which is already unlawful possession of a firearm. But also since the gun was bought in Illinois and then brought into Wisconsin that could also be charged as felony arms trafficking. So yeah.
"Killing" as if it was intent.
Should have stayed in jail
I think if he was black they would have praised him as a national hero n have a national holiday for him.
Kyle needed more SUPPORT at night! Did I mention MY PILLOW offers You more SUPPORT when your on your back on the asphalt ?!
I’m buying more MY PILLOWS ! Boycotting BED BATH and Kohl’s ! Love Kyle ! Self defense ! Thanks Mike ! Hero
Kyle an American hero !
Just burned my pillows
Ricky? holy crap...Based!
He can keep his pillow he will need it,   he hate and font think he wil, be hated, lol
Can we just put this to bed now, it all sounds like pillow talk to me.
Good for him. All he was doing was protecting a buisness. Two WHITE rioters charged at him for no reason.
After years in the army i've wouldn't handled it better than Kyle. Love this guy.
It was cheaper to give him a few pillows for him  stomach in jail.
❤️
He’ll get exonerated.  All the video is pretty conclusive. He tried to get away and they wouldn’t let him. He didn’t fire until they attacked with deadly weapons, and even than he only fired when he absolutely had too.  That by itself is going to be what keeps him from being convicted of murder.
What a chad
GREAT KYLE.
Losers
I like that Kyle kid
All heroes
What a hero
He looks like David Dobrik
LOL "he claims he was acting in self defense" the video shows he was. This is the "horrible reporter" guy.
“He claims” ???  There’s a video of him being chased
this kid will always be seen as a joke i would go to jail for him to shed light on what happened to those innocent people
Imagine a pillow smothering a human face forever.
just threw away my pillow
I can’t wait till he goes shopping for his new panties and bra he’s going to need them He’s going to make a nice bride once he step in to the penitentiary
Defently buying my pillow rn
Well "My Pillow" is OVER!!!
I bet they feel really  smart now that he skipped  out on bail 🤣😭
If he was black, it be a hole different story js
My pillow guy helps with bail?
God bless Mike and Kenosha Kyle.
Self defense!
Murderer!!! Satan bailed him out🤦‍♂️
...The "Ricker" wants his money back!
It's shameful how they bailed out and posed for photos with this cold blooded executioner. It is not only troubling, but also shameful and disgusting
Can anyone name even one prominent case in which a black US citizen used lethal force in self defense against multiple white US citizens and was not initially charged with murder?  I'm waiting ... and probably waiting forever.
So trump didn’t pardon this kid 🤔
Now I'm not going to buy my pillow I'm getting your pillow
Why didn't he get a ankle monitor 😲, why don't they know where he is 😒,oh, he white....👿
Fascist terrorists covering up for a fascist domestic terrorist.
That infantile boy fulfilled his dreams, he will face the consequences when sentenced to life in prison with some hardcore criminals.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE8LN_0trGE
Lol this guy guilty asf 😂😂💯...he going to jail cos he wanted to play hero lol😪
I love how they just had to throw oh he’s a trump supporter
This is OUTRAGEOUS!!!
OH THAT.... CRACKHEAD GUY!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
He’s innocent until proven guilty! And from my view of the footage I watched, he was being attacked so he defended himself. One attacker had a gun. Put me on the jury please
I bet he sleeps at night nice and cozy
LoL his company is doing so bad now he’s offering 66% off! Haha why don’t you racist turds go buy some pillows before he’s out of business which will be very soon.
“Sleep well america”
I wonder if Kyle had a MyPillow in prison?
My pillow dude back on crack?
Going to have to do some checking on Black Rifle Coffee
Okay, what it the situation were reversed?  An 18 year old black man shoots and kills two white supremist marchers with an assault rifle, then passes a number of cops heading to the scene of the shooting while walking away carrying his assault rife in plain sight.  He wouldn't need an attorney, or bail money.  He, more than likely, would be lying dead in the street after a brief encounter with police.
Clear self defence.
THEY LET HIM GO!!!
Who says the stand up comedy industry has died ? Take a bow ya 'all.
This kid should probably change his name. People dont forget and it's a new world now
Bless you little brother
GOOD!!!
Lol I don't understand how this is even self defense he had no reason to be there it wasn't his job and he wasn't obligated to be there and what makes it worse he had a AR15 with him for everyone to see thats asking for attention if you think your gonna walk around a blm protest with a gun and not get a reaction out of people your dumb asf ofcourse there gonna feel threatened by a white boy carrying a damm AR i hope get charged with both murders
What was he defending himself from the flys
The guy that was protecting himself against a violent mob of fire setting protesters! No criminal activity on his part as far as I'm concerned!
If it was a black man he was going under the prison.. f Donald Trump
Hero we need u in dc
Hero we need u in dc
American hero!
When your government cant help you call us rednecks they say thats why Japan didnt invade us to many of us to work over on
He went out looking for a fight, found one and someone ended up dead. The kid is guilty.
Maybe he we get a lifetime supply of  my pillows sent to him in prison. A gift from one white supremacist to another.
He "claims" he was acting in self defense?  Really?  You can't watch the videos and SEE that he was being attacked by those idiots?
Kyle Rittenhouse = Justified
WHITE PRIVILEGE: COURTESY GIVEN TO YOU TO COME UP WITH A SCENARIO 🤷ALWAYS FAVORABLE TO YOU 👍 WHEN YOU SIMPLY HAVE THE COMPLEXION FOR PROTECTION🙍
Wow that's 2 people I won't be supporting when I make purchases.
MyPillow should change their name to CoupPillow, the official pillow of the insurrection against the USA. Now available in one color: white supremacist.
So happy to see kyle rittenhouse be bailed out. He is a caring individual:)
So a kid illegally obtains a gun, goes to another state with protests going on, kills two people and gets bailed out by the crooked my pillow guy. The MAGA cult is truly despicable. Oh, and Rittenhouse had a big party with the proud boys not long ago too. He's a little murderous punk who should be punished not rewarded.
I sit here and wonder why the murder of MS -13 member wife murdered by the gang member (boyfriend) who was deported many times only to come back to a sanctuary city isn’t top news??? Then a healthcare nurse 26 yrs old murdered by two suspects on a highway but you don’t hear this on liberal media.  The ms-13 gang member shot her on from my of their 3 yr old child!!! When are we going to thank President Thump for seeing this country through reality and not the liberal media’s rise colored glasses!! I’m appalled, angry and sad this country voted in a democrat who never demanded nor supported a thing out President attempted to put an end to.  I support Trump who in my opinion is totally against violence but you only hear about the part that hurts Trump not them. I’m alert, healthy and wise and I see through this
I guess he’s a hero for killing 2 other Americans? He must be SO proud to self defense two men to death. What a hero!
Live Kyle
Heroe del mundo
WOoooohOOOOOO yeah woohooo!
Some good news.
Good man. Hope more ANITFA die.
Poor little Rittenhouse. Baby boy don’t even shave.
o/
Holy crap..my favorite pillow .my favorite childhood show are based af
It was self defense period
Attacked by three commies and put them away forever. Good job
Yeah he needs to be locked up he’s dumb he had no business being there in the first place! He was looking for trouble
Hero
I wonder what this is going to do for My Pillow sales
Hurray Kyle!!!!
Yes he’s free I’m so happy, he’s completely innocent and I wanna get the pillows for support
He should have KILLED THOSE pedophiles.
I am so glade he got out . I can’t stand those people who protest . This was clearly self defense.
This man shot 2 people and he walks off free?      He shouldn’t have been arrest in the first place and instead giving a M249 machine gun to blast more.
I can see the advertisment already....A guy runs up to him and hits him with a pillow then Kyle pulls out his AR15 shakes his head smiles and then hits him with a pillow instead *winks at the camera*
All hail conquering hero - KYLE RITTENHOUSE !!!!
Progressive zoomers and cancel culture - pikachu shocked face
Kyle Rittenhouse is a HERO!!! 🇺🇸
PILLOW MAN SAVE THE DAY
Lol
I'll be buying that pillow after seeing this. Kyle should be receiving a metal for taking out the trash. Poor kid went to try and help injured people and defend small businesses but ends up in a terrifying situation. I would have done the same.
God bless you Rittenhouse!! You beautiful hero!! 🙏🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲 Commies beware: an eye for an eye
Kid is an absolute hero.
daaaayum, 2mi bail?  ..kind of want a mypillow now
It was SELF DEFENSE, the majority of Americans knows it. Only thugs and Antifa want him in jail.  kyle is just a kid, yet he managed to protect himself against a whole gang of people. He was there to help. The first one he shot was a BULLY, if he hadn't tried to hurt Kyle he would still be alive, SO WOULD THE OTHER ONE. The other 2 were trying to stop what they thought was a random shooter. All Kyle knew is that HE WAS BEING ATTACKED.  Many people donated to get Kyle out, Praise THE LORD HE has people like Mike and the other man that are real life HEROES, ans so is KYLE.
Don't worry, they had to add "Trump supporter" that way they could trigger specific groups of people.
Oh you Republicans didn't think the election was going to turn out this way. Now that you inflicted a train wreck of a presidency on America you have lost all legitimacy and credibility. Now the tables have turned and the family values that you once embraced have been stripped from the social consciousness. You are exposed and so are your tactics. Even though you continually demean your adversaries you cannot see your own sins. Living in an ivory tower and tearing apart anyone that disagrees with your side of the story. We the People see your hateful means that you employ. And how you carefully nurture and groom the next generation by inculcation into a twisted reality, because of some doomsday conspiracy or catch phrase to obliterate the opposition. Government was set up to provide a decent existence. Instead we have Trump, your candidate, who tears half of the country down constantly and instills anger and fear, by telling you that your fellow Americans are evil or somehow defective, undeserving of kindness or dignity. Trump and his henchmen accomplish this solely, to maintain mind control and to stay in power. This method of interaction started in the nineties, with Newt Gingrich and his cronies. The state of the union is crumbling and all you care about is how to further divide Americans. Thank you for telling us what and who you pledge allegiance to.
Kyle is a hero.
What a wanker move doxing his supporters he is inocent before guilty. For a teenager he acted with great composure and only shot at his attackers that right there is self defence in my book.
Is he trying to get prisoners to buy pillows maybe?
Nice brcc
I hear firing squad is getting popular,  let's put Kyle in front of the line.
Dude got the UAV and almost got a care package.
Soft Pillow or Hard Pillow? Thick or Thin?
Kyle is gonna be biting pillows in the nick. Back door getting well and truly busted in.
Glad hes free
Will Michael also help murder victims family? 🤔🤔🤔
Welcome home hero
Kyle is a hero
the moron who pointed the glock handgun (probably illegal) and tried to take kyle"s life before he protected himself hasnt even been charged with anything. kudos to kyle and the pillow guy.
A hero has been forgiven by the pillow gods
Awesome. This young man is a hero, he's got more balls then 99% of americans who call themselves patriots.
You clowns all disgust me.
Ricky schroeder gonna get his. Nazi sympathizer and right wing neocon shill.
Self defense. PERIOD.
Oh wow 9000 more idiots exist than I thought, we need a culling..🙊
This guy is going to jail....
#NoJusticeforPhilandoNoJusticeforKyle
I'm ok with those criminals dying but if you put yourself in a situation like that is because you're looking forward to feel like a marine or something. This guy was lucky but in my book he's nothing but a soldier wannabe who wants to play militia in his backyard while there's actual heroes risking their life.
Everyone likes that
Thanks to this kid trump is outta here 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 phew 😅 ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
That’s some privilege right there boy
GOOD SHOOTING MATE
Hope they jail this kid for life! Little racist murderer.
Fake news
Oh yeah. Respect from MD!
good, kyle can repay by putting down more antifa!
As opposed to the little rodents going around destroying the hopes and dreams of many Americans and were bailed out by the fecal specimen known as Soros
LETS GOOOOOOO
Is this a joke he killed 2 people and got bribed out of jail and its just okay? What???
He is a national hero
How could he even shoot straight with that lazy eye 😭😭
What did the pillow say as it fell off the bed?  Oh sheet!
Who actually watched all the footage? Self defense for sure.
I know Ricky schroder and Mike lindell are not going to come visit that man while he's in prison for a long time....
This is straight fckry. He posted bail?? How?? Coz hes white??
Lol.
Rittenhouse deserves to go to prison for the rest of his life and Rick Schroeder's  is a moron for helping bail him out. Woman beater. I'm so tired of celebrities putting their noses in business of others because they think they are somebody they are not.
From Australia I say WELL DONE KYLE  , and good luck for your future.
AMERICAN HERO
Trump and his horde of hogs are all degenerates.
There's going to be a trial on January and his chances of going free If I have to compare to math are about 1% Or less than 0.5% He's not gonna get away with this.
Thankyou for helping this young man..
Good!!!
White man killed two people out on bonds? Does it apply to all non-White people too?
He better take plenty of baseline when he goes to prison bubba is waiting!!!
I won't be buying the overpriced pillow from that racist pillow founder now.
According to ABC News; By James Hill, (December 7, 2020.)  "John Pierce Kyle's lawyer declared no income and substantial personal debts, including federal and state tax tabs of $1.05 million, a $90,000 bank loan and a $27,000 debt owed to his former mother-in-law."
This is why we don’t need guns as everyday people ..ban all guns
Goodluck in prison🤣😂☠ Dont drop that soap!!!!😂
I hope he gets sent to prison.  He's a murderer.
It's rediculious that there even taking this to trial!!! There's absolutely no evidence of the first shooting so if the last two attacks on Kyle were obviously self defense. Then the first attack was most likely self defense. A skateboard, baseball bat and handgun are all deadly weapons. Cops get away with shooting people for reaching in there pockets. And the second amendment doesn't discriminate age, or gender.
Kills two people. Mutilates another. States he’s white and rolls with blue line gang.. *gets bonded from jail...* Blue line gang makes 2 million dollars**
WTF.
These people are evil
Teenager still smiles after killing two people.
Kyle did nothing wrong.
Shooting someone unarmed is murder. Self-defense plea doesn't make sense when you are the one with a high powered weapon. 16 years or more with a chance of parole.
If that's a post release photo then he really shouldn't be wearing that t-shirt.
Kyle did what grown men couldn’t ! God bless the second and the USA 🇺🇸
The MyPillow guy omggggg what????
Because he was ...daaa?
They shot at him first and then violently pursued him. What would you've done?
Whatever you think of what happened...  ... someone that killed two people shouldnt be able to bail out!
Good he was defending himself
Rittenhaus was someone who for sure would have gone to the police academy...  At least he is now caught before he would have done the same thing whilst being cop and protected by the justice system.
Kyle Rittenhouse - AMERICAN HERO 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
My pillow to the rescue. Hilarious. It’s like someone hijacked my country and replaced normal people with lunatics. Everything that’s gone on since Trump got in, it’s like a bad dream.
Non biased. Straightforward. Didn't jump to conclusions. No spin just facts. REAL JOURNALISM.
The video evidence also claims he was acting in self defense.
Outrageous!!!  He kills two people & wipes the arm off a third & he gets bailed out... this is SIK.
If he gets sentenced guilty im genuinely losing hope for this country...
Kyle needs to be put to sleep permanently
He won't be able to say My Pillow in jail.
Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero we need more men like him to protect our women and children because the government refuses to
Biggest jerk out.
Why is he  charged with murder when it's clearly self-defense
This country has gone insane if they think he is guilty
This is truly sad what they are trying to do to this young man. He stood his ground like a true patriot.   Best wishes to the young man.
A teen that killed a pedofile trying to put hands on him. Good job in my book.
Bound over for trial today - good work, dad.
just had to throw in the "trump supporter" didnt ya
Wow, wow
Nice. He is a real Hero. Best wishes from Germany
People are dumb there is video of Kyle tripping on the ground with his rifle and everyone rushing him and people think this isn't self defense whay you think there just gonna go give him a hug
If you were not in possession of that semiautomatic machine gun would you have Cross state lines? Were you illegally in possession of that semiautomatic rifle you crossed state lines with?  Next time will you walk or run away from trouble? Now you have blood on your hands. For what? You don't know. Neither do we.
LETSS GOOO
My Pillow...they sell white sheets too!
Free Kyle Baby! #FtheMedia
fluff piece
LIES!!,
I wish I could run into kyle I would give him the justice he deserves
why wasn't the gun owner charged?
It was self defence.  It’s on video, stupid.
DISGUSTING.LET KYLE HAD BEEN KYRE!!HE CHOSE TO GO THERE!!
Just came here for the comments.
A double murderer posts bail with help from right wing extremests. But at some point he's going to prison for the rest of his life
WOW SMFH 🇺🇸😂 wow no more freedom of speech this is all they would allow me to post sick country
I'm just going to say what would happen if Kyle was a black? Will it be self-defense or murder
Happy for you bro, good luck.
Congrats to kyle and his family. I am not a trump supporter but that kid is a hero.
CNN just published an Op-Ed regarding his bail. Watch video at @Y7t4
White privilege.
It's a sad day when a Trump supporter who murdered in cold-blood posts bail thanks to Trump supporters who condone it.
Now black people know how white people felt when OJ was released
Pretty bonkers...since when is a double murder and illegal firearm suspect allowed bail?  He actually drove across state lines to another city to commit the shooting.  He chose to carry an assault weapon to the demonstration and shot unarmed protestors.  The whole self-defense argument doesn’t make a bit of sense.  With the facts as I understand them, what message does it send about the donors and what dies it mean for their legacies to support an accused double-murderer in this way?  Like I said in my opening comments...it’s bonkers and hard to wrap my mind around their justification.
Now we know ticky strodder is racist who would’ve thought me silverspoons , nypd actor wowwww you never know
Someone will eventually take care of him in jail
Stay strong young man ..self defense laws are on your side...as is every intelligent citizen in this country ..
"Those aren't pillows!"
I’m not even an armchair defense attorney (flunked out of armchair law school) but I hope his Lawyers are doing the right thing. Isn’t there a real possibility that this very specific type of publicity could backfire?
Kyle is like one of those confederate fallen failed "heroes".. where he is considered a heroe even though his party lost the war 🤣🤣🤣
Glad your out kyle many people are standing behind you stay strong brother we are all glad you get to spend the Holidays with your family
They're going to release a new line of pillows called  AR - Tontines
Kyle is not a hero 😏
Free Kyle
Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero, you can’t change my mind.
Remember when these same ZOMBIES that are joking and patting this guy on the head and saying "ATTA BOY" wanted to LYNCH JUSSIE SMOLLET,  sicc'ed FBI on him, and tried to get him SIXTEEN YEARS??!  Ah, the GOOD old days!
I like how they threw in "avid Trump supporter" about the my pillow guy.... wtf has that got to do with anything?
https://youtu.be/7lVmMNE3oXw
I'm glad I didn't buy that pillow.
He was safer in jail lol
Kyle punched a girl and my pillow owner punched his girlfriend this is going to be good
“Free Kyle” before he starts punching holes in drywall. Then who will bail him out? Monster Energy™️?
"Murder suspect"  He's a self defense suspect if anything.
I know what pillow im buying and I like how they are called protesters you mean a child molester and a wife beater
Well. Guess im buying a pillow and a season of "Silver Spoons" wasnt that the show Ricky Schroeder was in?
In the end I'd like to see Kyle sue the two guys he shot for the price of the bullets he used to defend himself.
Yesss on ya go m8
Thank you Ricky Schroder for being a patriot and God bless you Kyle we're also being a patriot and protecting your community 🙏🏻❤
Simple fact is if he wasn’t on scene in possession of a gun he shouldn’t of had as an under age person and outright brandishing it he wouldn’t be in this situation
Those worms
Happy that let him out for self defense  why did he get put in for self defense   I agree self defense  from every angle I look at it
Our justice system is completly broken if this doesn't go down as self defense. Its already broken given that heros had to pay 2 million for bail.
Not too surprising that a woman beater would think someone that open fired a gun he was illegally in possession of killing 2 and injuring another is justified. Because he killed 2 guys with CRIMINAL records? Just like HIM?
He is still a RACIST who killed people.  Self defense is when you have no other option because someone came towards you ... not you going to someone with a gun, and when the people protect themselves, you shoot them.  That’s not what self defense means.  The idiots who bailed him out are also low keyed RACIST.  But the Killer will have his day in court ....
I love mypillow
absolute legend
"The teen that shot two convicted pedophiles while they attacked him with skateboards and pulled a gun on him" There, fixed it for ya
The reality of the America we live in.
Claims? Video footage clearly shows that he WAS.
So because you're a has been, washed up child actor, we're supposed to respect your opinion on this criminal?!!! Here's an idea, take care of your own run in with the cops, and keep your opinions to yourself.
Awesome he’s got Blackout rifle coffee company shirt on lol

Kids a hero
I guess it all adds up: Silver Spoons...  White privilege...  Ricky Schroder arrested for domestic abuse...  Racist shooter...  Trump supporter...
So happy they helped the 17 year old out.
A killer let out by a scam artist... Nice
So it’s ok with Schrodrer for a person to travel out of State and murder protesters? What a complete imbasil anti American headcase today’s republicans are. Murdering is not ok. He went to Wisconsin with a gun with one thing on his twisted mind. If America stands for law and order this murderer will spend his miserable little life in prison.
Clearly self defence, anyone would have done the same in Kyle Rittenhouse shoes, well done Mike Lindell and Ricky Schroder for being a true patriots, I'm definitely purchasing a pillow from his wonderful company, it's the least I can do to support these guys!
If Kyle was black, he would have been sentenced to life. But he’s not, so he’s out on bail within weeks after deliberately murdering multiple people with an illegally purchased weapon !
Give a special made pillow for his prison sentence
Drop the charges
Freedom for you kyle not for me - My Pillow
Lori Vallow needs that much money to post bail after murdering her children. Think they could help post bail for her too?
self defense is not a crime in ANY circumstance. IF fools didnt attack people, fools might still be alive.
I have 4 AR15s in my gun safe and I think it’s absolutely disgusting that they helped this murderer out of prison. And then like congratulating him on it. Unbelievable. No regard for the lives he took all because he wanted to look cool with his brand new assault rifle he knew nothing about. Kids like this give assault rifles a bad name. I promise 99% of us are not like this.
Has anyone else noticed that Kyle looks like green days lead singer  billie joe
So guys setting fires to businesses attack this kid one pulling a gun and he fires in clear self defense and the media acts like Rittenhouse is a murderer. Clear self defense can’t be any clearer. I can’t believe they are going to try and charge him with murder. No way a jury of 12 convicts this kid unless of course they are all DemocRATS.
Ok I’m British and I gotta say that was self defence there’s a grown man chasing you who has mental illness you hear a gunshot so you turn around to defend yourself simple as that  Then he tries to walk away as he’s 15/16 just shot someone has no idea what’s happening to be hit by a skateboard and another man holding a gun   S e l f  D e f e n c e
I don’t want My Pillow anymore ! It’s giving me nightmares!
Time for this Cop want to be is given just what he deserves .... Life in prison so he can think about what he has done !
Lol that's why Rickey is  receiving death threat's as we speak 🤣😂😁
He killed two people, got to drive home to Illinois, and is out on bail right now with a new partnership. This country is in trouble.
No Ricky Schroder say he’s being threatened on social media poor Little him I guess that’s what you get when you do stupid stuff to bring attention to yourself
I'll buy pillows for my whole family after this to support
You ever just watch a YouTube video... and you KNOW the comments are going to be absolute GOLD...? Yep... this was one of those videos.
...A murderer freed by an "ex" drug addict and an aging, washed-up, drunken, actor/domestic abuser.  Wonder if Ricky's alimony payment cleared the bank?
Lock him up
Kyle is a hero!!!
The "my pillow" guy won't be able to sleep at night now that he has seen the election results. He should create a "cry pillow".
Self-defense all day long , two less commies is always good too
Self defense
CLAIMS self defense? it was nothing but self defense
USA! USA! WOO GUNS! /sarcasm
wow really!
Unfuckingbelievable!! 😡😡😡
Thank you Mike Lindell and Rick Schroder!  Kyle Rittenhouse should never have been charged by a politically-motivated Leftist prosecutor, let alone have spent the last three months in jail for an obvious act of self-defense.  WAKE UP! People of Wisconsin and the rest of America. Can't you see where the real danger to your liberty lurks?
So 17 year old who obtained a firearm illegally and murdered two people . Two unarmed protesters with a carbine purchased for him by a buddy who he gave the money to purchase , He went to another state to go hunt protesters . Yea , I’d call that premeditated murder . These two idiots bailed this punk out .  Pillow fk er and Ricky Schroeder from silver - my show got cancelled spoons . And Jonathan Crouch, Before you start your argument is a non sequitur .  This kid committed first degree murder . He went across state lines with an AR 15 with a 30 round mag and tac gear to bully and intimidate, under the false guise of altruistic intentions . It is one thing to shoot the wolf that attacks you at you while you are just sitting in your front porch . It is quite another to walk into the Den of a wolf and kick the elder wolf and are surprised when the entire pack jumps you .  This little boy was playing army but guess what , HIs attitude AND STIMULUS MONEY - yes that’s right , our tax dollars bought the murder weapon - PURCHASED WEAPON Were some of the reason he is a murderer .  His friend , a 19 year old bought the weapon for him with STIMULUS MONEY.  HIS father and mother were both aware .  Then after he committed the capital crime , the cops who gave him high fives and water allowed him to go back across state lines home. There are MANY who are complicit here. As for race . Yes it does have a lot to do with it .  Here in Texas , I can legally walk about with my rifle . ( yes I am a gun owner) As a white person , I would probably be okay .  If I were black , I would be shot dead. The cops who allowed Rittenhouse to walk up to them with a loaded carbine would have opened fire on black or brown person . I can show you many examples - land btw that is what the protest was about , So stop trying to defend and deflect yourself .  Now , I agree . Those people should have avoided a 17 year old without good sense walking about with a loaded weapon . But Mr Rittenhouse is home with his family enjoying thanksgiving dinner. His victims are dead . They will never see another holiday with their families because a little boy wanted to play army ,   Rittenhouse took the law into his own hands and he WILL pay for his crimes . I’m a gun own , have had mu,triple weapons ,carbines , pistols and Chl . I support the rule of law . Think of the attempted Coup on the Michigan governor . I have not heard 1 republican condemn the people , standing around with assault rifles , pistols ,BMGs and yea rocket launchers . This country needs gun legislation . Yes go and buy your guns but , be qualified physically and mentally to use them , have insurance . I’m good for training too. Just like an automobile . You train to drive a car , you pass a written and driving test . (As an aviator I have to pass a written ,practical and oral test ) you have to have insurance ,  You have to be of legal age to drive . Rittenhouse was a minor when the crime was committed .  The act of going to another state with a weapon , brandishing it , playing army and thereby exacerbating the situation defines his motive . A motive which is first degree murder ,
UNLIKE BLACK RIFLE COFFEE The far left money bags for Democrats , MIKE LINDELL AND RICKY SUPPORT THE 2ND AMMENDMANT , to bad BRCC sold out to the left
Great to see rittenhouse out. He was attacked by thugs, they were burning down businesses. He will be found not guilty.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
Kyle will be the "bite my pillow" guy in the joint .
Great news/
search- Kyle Rittenhouse punches girl- and see what kind of person this really is
3 wackos glorifying murder.
Oh, my pillow sucks. Watch the YouTube video on them.
You should all be ashamed of yourself. The boys going to prison.
No pillows for me..
2A wins!
Smiling?  He killed people.
DROP AND GIVE ME 20.... and STFU
White privilege
Everyone getting My Pillows for Christmas gifts.
Yea...I just shot someone to death and I'm gonna pose and smile for social media photos. This kid is gonna get 30+ years in prison you wait and see.
Gotta buy a My Pillow  now 😎
Thank God there are good people out there to help this kid.
Now black celebrities need to pose with pictures of OJ Simpson and post the picture on Ricky’s Twitter account!
This bookends the rise of the far right which Homeland Security calls the greatest threat to American Security. Ritterhouse & James Alex Fields Jr. exemplify the profile of a twisted understanding of what is right and wrong or America....gaslighted by an irresponsible Trump Administration that is reminiscent of two other dangerous Presidency's;  Andrew Jackson(1829) & Woodrow Wilson(1913) oddly both 100 years apart from the Trump(2016)  regime.  The only silver lining is that Trump Presidency was one term which may mean that American's  moral values were challenged and then rejected by the electorate.  Unfortunately, the reality is that Trump's lack of sensitivity, mishandling and blatant lies with regard to COVID defeated him. With the use of William Barr & a self serving majority of Republican Senators, Trump was able to manhandle power, however, Trump could not wrestle a coronavirus pandemic which proved non negotiable... As Trump flails through the process of grief with the loss of his Presidency, one can take a guilty pleasure by seeing him twist himself into knots as evitability stares him down after the four years of over 20,000 false, misleading and half baked statements, unfortunately and sadly, some 250,000 people who lost their live because of Trump's hubris, paranoia, poor judgement and politicization of his nemesis, COVID19 in his words the Chinese flu...
About time ...
Killer
I almost never seen this many dislikes on a video.
Hes done, Trump lost and his loser fan base is done! That boy is going to prison and Jerome is waiting!
Correction riot
Kind of dumb he was even charged to begin with imo
Free my boy
This is what white privilege looks like.
Schroeder is telling Rittenhouse what its going to feel like when he gets his butt reamed while in prison. Better smile while you still can.
In all seriousness though, My Pillows are great, have bought a few....that was totally unsolicited by the way.
If Ricky Schroeder hadn't been mentioned here I would have never given him another thought!  I completely forgot he even existed.
I’m not a liberal and i don’t support blm but this kid deserves to be locked up for life
Sad but he will do a few years for manslaughter and then live a very successful life....just like George Zimmerman
He's innocent.
This is cold man..... just like the other side of my pillow
lol waste of money. just like the fools who donated to tRumps campaign 🤣😂🤣😂
I guess when you haven't had a steady job since the 80's this is how you get your face back on tv.
Black rifle coffee company = grifters
Anyone who supports Kyle Rittenhouse sniffs glue.
Throwing in Trump supporter.  Keep up the hate media ....
Hero
*Why is the White community, the people of European descent in conflict for strange black Africans! -_-*
Insert a joke about pillows here.
“He claims self-defense.” No, really? Imagine that, somebody punches you in the back of the head, somebody else knocks you to the ground, someone is yelling “get him!” If this wasn’t self-defense, there is *no such thing.*
So who killed who with the pillow?
"My Pillow" posted his bail? What's he smokin...?😛
Not sure what the smiles are about..  Stupid kid
Disgusting...
Good- we have violet poeces of human waste here in New York that get set free with no bail everyday
He's lucky he got out of jail be fore sumone shanked him
From the videos released to the public, it’s pretty clear he was shooting in self defense. Was his decision to “patrol” that night wise? Probably not, but stupid isn’t a crime.
Pee-low?
Epic
Ricky Schroeder will never work again lol
https://youtu.be/Fic4BlQvx1c
The Onion’s production value is way up these days, even the newscaster seems like an actual reporter.
He defended himself and sent them to there final resting place... You to can be sent to your final resting place but there is no need to go there without a comfy pillow!! Introducing "My pilow" so comfortable it must be death edition... The must be death edition provides you with the warmth and comfort you deserve when your taking a dirt nap... Forever!!!
He shot and killed a person  and then two others tried to stop him from killing more people and he shot them self defense is a joke he is a murderer and should be held accountable and his parents and friends should be charged as he was not old enough to even own a gun he is a killer.
Kyle’s going to jail, hint 2 million bail. He deserves life along with th ‘adults’ who thought Kyle was a win win.
Rick Schroeder and Pillow King 2024
Kyle " 3 hole punch" Rittenhouse.  My spirit animal
Rest assured on my pillow that this kid has a long way ahead of him.
IM HAPPY FOR HIM.
God bless 🙏 🙌 ❤
Good
Good I hope he lays low
"He claims he was acting in self defense" uhhhh, that's what shooting someone pointing a gun at you is, no matter how you feel about it
Instead of reporting on this bail mess! How about reporting on how poorly and recklessly our government is treating Americans during this pandemic? People are dying and homeless, without food while congress and the senate go on multiple paid vacations and having bat a care For the people of America thanksgiving! Smh
Why are they smiling? He took lives.
I know this kid said he went there to help people but you don't bring a loaded firearm across state lines to help people. He wasn't a cop. If he thought he needed a gun for protection he should have stayed home. I agree he also thought his life was in danger but he shouldn't have been there in the first place. It's the same thing when someone tries to rob someone and killed the victim. Now the robber probably thought he'd rob someone without violence. Just show the gun. But they used the gun and now they are guilty of murder and unfortunately so is this kid.
Looks like I’ll be setting up a program to make sure over 1 million of my pillows get sent back because he does have a guarantee on all of his pillows! he will be going bankrupt in the next six months from so many pillows Going back! Dang crackhead, that was his first business!
That boy is going to make someone in prison real happy!, So he better bring an extra pillow....or two 😂
Hopefully he gets a custom jail cell pillow
America ... dropped the ball again! Smdh
Bad news Kyle. Trump can't pardon you now.
Good. Defended himself.
What do we expect from Trump supports as this despicable type of openness is normal.  These two stand behind a murderer and bail him out.........  Everybody can see the video as his life was not in jeopardy.  The most that happened was a plastic bag was thrown at him........
Imagine being illegally armed with an automatic assault rifle and being underage, going across two state lines and murdering people is self-defense? I guess only if you're Republican!!!
PATHETIC
There goes my Hero .watch him as he goes down in history as the Greatest American Patriot ever@ the poster child of Bravery in the face of Tyranny!!! Star Spangled Rittenhouse yea waves.  ;)
Vote with your money.  Buy nothing from this company.  Tell retailers if they carry his products you will boycott store.
Better hope nobody smothers him with My Pillow !
He would have been safer in jail for the rest of his life. People know who he is, what he did, and where he lives. He’s a dead man walking.
Great news! More to follow when President Trump is re-elected 🇺🇸
A murderer gets off scottfree..... only in America! I hope the families of the victims will go after him and the ones that helped him get out, outrageous
What is wrong with this world 🤦🏼‍♂️
Wow how disturbing.  Not surprised  though
I keep forgetting.. the are 70m crazy people  and 75m biden supporters with good sense
If that wasn't self defense,  I don't know what is. Dumb fks brought a skateboard to a gunfight, and lost. Period.
They will groom him & before we know it he'll be getting molested & abused by these people that "helped" him post bail. I guarantee he'll be abused or dead before we know it. So sad!!
Lock him up #LockHimUp
Lol @ these leftists. CNN barely covering this anymore. It was self defense. Live with it
I don’t know how to feel about this exactly
America boycott my pillow...don't buy..ricky schroeder washed up punk ..both u dudes bogus..you support hate groups home grown american hate group..BoyCot my pillow...fukn low life
Better training could have resulted in a different result.
What was that teenage child doing armed at a "protest"? He had no business even being armed and at a so called "protest". He was not protecting himself in the first place because if he was he would not have been there. There are many ways to legally and peacefully protest. The people making his case into a media event are sadly lacking intellect and integrity. Things like this show the world that America is not Great Again, but still sliding down to the decadent degenerate pit.
I like how the same people that are pro-life defend a kid that killed two people. Doesnt matter if it was justified or not. He ended two people on that day. Two defenseless men with no guns whatsoever.
N A Z I
Kyle acted in self defense, just watch the video of the shootings, if then u dont understand,  your ignorant .
Videos don’t lie . He has the right to defend himself
somehow I believe"my pillow" will go out of business.
There is no justice for the people who lost their loved one's shame.
Not sure why they keep calling it a "protest". It was a riot. Anyway good for him. Hope he beats all those charges.
It's so obvious it was self-defense and he was a political prisoner, like the MSM wishes they could make all Americans.
He should have never been arrested. Our judicial system failed him
But R Kelly still don’t have a bond
So a 17 year old kid, shows up at a contentious rally, has a AR 15 style weapon. Shoots kills two, injuring another. All in self defense? My question is wtf is a kid doing with an assault weapons at a demonstration? And to top it off, the far right brands him a hero? While the far left has demonic, satanic, worshipping rituals?
I would love a good pillow to eat
Should’ve never been in jail in the first place.
Never knew that the my pillow guy supports terrorism
My Pillow Biter
You would know sick minded Trump surporters,Iam glad none of my Friends,never ever bought any of his pillows.
Joke if you want...but too many people are being killed without justice! I guess if you're white it's okay. God help us!!!!!
So black rifle coffee is a Nazi white supremacist company?
I started to purchase a My Pillow...glad I didn't. I will NEVER purchase ANY of his products...Kyle just hurt his business. He's got money to flush down the toilet flush it down on me because I'm the Sh!t.
Shooting someone in the head never looked so rewarding lol
$10,000 for whoever ties him up and films skinning the little white boy alive
Justice for Kyle !!
Silver spoons. At least now we know.
God Bless Kyle and his Family!!!  <3
One of the guys or both that was killed is a sexual predator so I am not very sad over it
I could just imagine the many  US militia groups wanting so much to have him amongst their ranks. By the amount of support he has gotten, he could singlehandedly lead an army at this point.
The teen that defended his own life while being attacked by criminals, rioting. Leftists in covid masks committing crimes. Bring it.
Bros face is so fat lmao
True Patriot.
See you Dec 14 / Jan 6 dates ~ KRAKEN REVELATION
BRCC has some great coffee tbh
Greetings, check out this video. https://youtu.be/OvV-QeL1uVs like share and subscribe.
It might have been self defense if someone had thrown a pillow instead of a plastic bag.
He was looking for smoke and he found fire. Oh well. How he gets 40 years
Republican murderer and all around trash bag Kyle Bitchenhouse should face the firing squad
Patriot
Women beaters stick together.
Repeat this prayer from your mouth, and believe it in your heart.  Dear Heavenly Father, i turn to you today, I repent of my sins; I believe that your Son Jesus Christ, died on the cross for my sins, and was resurrected to life on the third day, and forever more he lives. Father, I ask of you to baptize me with the Holy Spirit right now, Change my heart, and renew my spirit. I invite you Jesus, to enter into my heart. change me, Save me, and be Lord of my life. Right now, in your mighty name, I pray, Amen!  Romans 10:9  If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
I still dont even really know if pillows are truly good for our necks. But I do know is the my pillow guy use to be a crack addict.
Self denfense these nuts. He went outside. And killed people and got away with it. He wasnt at home. He was walking with ARs. Gtfo here
Really Ricky
I hate that my pillow commercials  shame on them all!
It was self defence tho lol. Imagine being an organisation as ironically named as Antifa, acting like SS thugs.
#freekyle
I'm gonna contemplate this decision with my pillow
wholesome
First it is very saddening to see these people tell this boy and others like him that driving across state lines (or any where else for all that matters) with your assault riffle, to where protest/looting is going on, and gun down two unarmed people and claim that you felt threatened is absurd!  Each time celebrities and public figures reveal or are exposed to be/side with white nationalist, bigots, or hate groups I gladly make the conscious decision to boycott their products and services!
Can't wait to see all the fake news pedophiles, Satanist, murderers and thieves hang high. And all you coward slave mask wearers can go jump in a tar pit.
This kid went into a situation with an assault rifle, knowing that the probability was high that he was going to / have to use it. No matter your take on what happened, the FACT is that he killed people.
Best duo would of been Phil Swift & Mike Lindell
This video combines footage from multiple videos and provides more information about what happened in this incident -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0lLwfwwfDE&t=629s
People do realize this just means he's allowed to await trial from home right? Even if they declare it self defense, he still broke several laws just by being in possession of the gun and brandishing it in public. Not to mention the trouble the person gave him the firearm will be in.
Good. It was self defense . Clear as day
"there's so much evidence proving it was self defense" lol right just like "there's so much evidence of voter fraud". Here's where America's all time favorite toxic trait comes in to play, aka (Reality vs Fantasy). Fantasy - Kyle acted in defense and is a true American patriot and hero, he did what the police wasn't doing, BLM is destroying our cities and he needs to be set free of all charges. Pretty accurate huh? But let's take a look at the Reality. The reality that the judges, lawyers and jury are all looking at. Kyle is an underage, bullied highschool dropout vigilante who went into another state pass the set curfew to illegally open carry a  rifle to which he did not have the permit to have in his possession. He lied to the police about being there to protect a business (the owners came out and said they did no such thing, pertaining to hiring kyle or any of his friends) and the reason why he was being chased was because he had already shot someone in the head. They were trying to take the gun away from him. Not only did he prove he wasn't there to provide medical aid to anyone (seeing as he didn't bother to check on first person he shot) he also fled the scene for which he was later arrested as a "FUGITIVE".
Disgusting
even if kyle rittenhouse goes to trial and is found innocent by a jury,who will hire him?what school will accept him?will he be able to lead the normal life of a young person after that?
this question may not have been asked here------what is a 17 year old doing up in kenosha at that time of night in the midst of a very volatile riot with an assault rifle saying he was there to protect a business that the business owner said he hired no security?
God I hate what this country has come to
Jail.
🤢 🤮 🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮
So gross
Kyle,  my prayers are with you.  You’d acted in self defense.  The world knows it.
Thats still isnt as bad as blm worshiping criminals as Gods in their riots. So idk guys lets call it even on this one 😂😂😂
I was going to leave a comment. But decided to let Karma catch up with him. He can't escape karma. His victims won't get justice in our country.
Rittenhouse has got his teeth into the pillow business now, that little pillow biter!
what a waste on money.
***Trump Virus 2020*** Misuse and Abuse of Government Agencies!
AMV  https://youtu.be/re2brz8wA4s
The whole 'he shouldn't have been there' attempt at proving his guilt is meaningless. If he shouldn't be there then sentence him for it but it still doesn't change the fact that the only three people shot out of thousands of protestors were the three who attacked him first
Woooooow... This kid is out on bail for MURDER?? Unlawful use of an Assault Rifle by a minor. Killed 2 Injured 1 then walks to the cops n didn't even get shot .. On VIDEO... Clear evidence .. Lost of words..NOT REALLY!!👿👿👿
This is such trash fake news
Stirring up the divide and conquer I see. It’s all apart of the plan. To get people fighting in the streets. Well it’s already happening.
Ricky schroder. Who?
Question officer! Where might one find this “My Pillow”
Kyle was a my pillow customer.
The fact that there are so many videos of this kid getting attacked and lynch mobbed and clearly defending himself - yet half the world thinks hes a savage monster who should rot in jail - just goes to show how absolutely mindless people have become
Now it make sense why my pillow tried to smother me
Well I’d say he had a soft pillow landing
Anyone touches Kyle ill cut you.
Only in 2020 does Ricky Schroder and Mike Lindell have more balls than all of the veterans who work and own BRCC. #evanlaughner
Good.
Great news!
Should have been no bail for anyone who takes someone’s life
Acts 2:38 (KJV)  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 5:32 (KJV)  And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. Hebrews 5:9 (KJV)  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Proverbs 28:13 (KJV)  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy, Hebrews 12:14 (KJV)  Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord'.
Hmmmmm, might just be me but...... I think murderers should stay in jail but what do I know~
He deserves his day in court.
I cant sleep!! He got my pillow.. 😒
All that free advertising for my pillow and black rifle coffee
Murderer. Victim has a gunshot to the back that perforated his lung. Explain how that's self defense.
I guess Black Rifle Coffee is really about BLM.
Please tap this link!🙏🥺❤️ https://youtu.be/OOPc8mtGsxo
Well My Pillow, I'm waiting for new series of pillow supressors
Anyone with an IQ above 70 knows Kyle is innocent.
Who is this guy and why is he worth 2 million that he will never see 🧐
The only good communist is a dead one! Free Kyle🤩🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Bonded out by the MyPillow guy wearing a Black Rifle Coffee shirt...the irony is so fitting.
Glad he's out that kid was running for his life and pillow the whole time
ｋａｖｕ　ｒａｐ
ONLY IN AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!! YOU COULDN'T DREAMT THIS UP, WITH OR WITHOUT THE PILLOW
Innocent
This kid is a hero :)
Thank god somebodys helping that poor boy ....
This kid acted in self defense.  He was 17 so he's in the wrong for being there with a gun. But every other video and thing I've seen shows him defending himself from "adults"
For the people saying it was self defense, what was he doing there armed in the first place?
Disgusting murderer
He went looking for a fight by inserting himself into what was basically a combat zone. Any good concealed carry holder knows you do not go looking for trouble. He did, and that's why he needs to face the consequences. He had no business being there, and it's this reality that makes all the talk about self defense and weapons laws irrelevant. Sorry to burst your bubble. And by the way I'm a conservative republican and have been for a long time.  Personally I'd love to make that soft chubby little face of his unrecognizable
I heard his pillows are good at soaking up liberal tears....
My Pillow guy should have taking that money and got some better Pillows.his pillows are the worst!
Ricky's trying to get laid I knew him and Corey McCormick had something in common! 😃.... EEEEWWWWWW
Wow.
Watch "A Message To Rudy 2020" on YouTube https://youtu.be/FD4wEtUg5F8
Who else is here for pillow talk?
Hmm. He claims self defense. The guy is walking around offering medical attention to people being attack by radical leftist. He is carrying a firearm to defend himself from those radicals. He aids the the very people the radicals are attacking. Then they turn and attack him. That's clearly self defense. Those radicals need to be shot and killed. Anyone who attack my family or Myself needs to be put down.
Glad he's out...
It was self defense we've all seen the video.
*BY THE WAY LIBERALS. TRUMP WON. AN U ARNT GNA DO A FUHKN THING ABOUT IT 8)))))))*  *IF U CANT HANDLE THE* *FREEDOM WAY OF LIFE TAKE* *UR COMMIE A* *SS* *HOLES TO CHI* *NA* *FOR SOME* *AN*   *AL SPREADING THERAPY FROM TBE DICTATOR*  *WHICH IM SURE U WILL ENJOY THOROUGHLY* *8)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))*

Good on em
Wait what
Who's the pillow biter
I love this kid.
Look he’s not a saint and shouldn’t of been there in the first place, but if you think he was a white supremacist that just gunned down two people for no reason, and then got out of jail because he’s white... PLEASE do your own research and listen to people who rely on facts & evidence while presenting a story like this. The media bias, especially on social media, has been horribly skewed and doesn’t even tell or show you what ACTUALLY happened that night. This is not me supporting him, but encouraging people to do actual research that presents the event unfiltered & without bias.
The Kenosha Kid meets The Pillow Guy. The Orange Man gave them his blessing. They fought off the wicked forces of Antifa using maga powers. The sinister Creepy Uncle Joe is trying to undermine it all.   American folk heroes
White privilege at its finest smdh
imagine literally getting away with murder
The guys a murderer not a hero you dont go armed to a protest shoot 2 people and call it self defense thats murder
Happy .happy .happy
Smfh. I hate this place
I'm happy hes out.
I don’t get how the bus didn’t stop I jumped in front of it and he should’ve slammed on the brakes sooner not my fault he wasn’t expecting it-
hope these guys die
If we get karma on small things,what do you think his karma will be?
Good for Kyle
This country is disgusting... He's a murderer who deserves to be put away for life, not glorified
Top 10 best anime crossovers 🤣
How disappointing.
wtf. like actually? idc if u support the red side or the blue side. this is crazy
I can not go more then 1 comment without seeing a pillow comment
Are you kidding me? "He claims he was acting in self defense". He definitely was, and if you think otherwise then you shouldn't be able to use any piece of technology above a toaster.
My Pillow...for when your face down, biting one, you want your prison stay comfortable.
He makes bedsheets too guys
Not gonna lie, I have a MyPillow and I plan on buying a new one every year! It’s the best pillow
It was clearly self defense--  and anyone who says otherwise obviously hasn't seen the footage.
The my pillow guy only did it so he can lay in the bed with the kid and pillow talk with him
Ordering my first ever My Pillow today.
A.S.O.L.E.S, self defense BS.
Didn't this guy shoot people? Why is he getting bail? Why are there actually people defending him? That isn't right... What the heck, people?
His T-Shirt: “Black Rifle Coffee Company”   Surely... surely that’s a joke
MY PILLOW ABOUT TO LOSE HELLA BUSINESS LMAOOO
We'll, when people shut down his gofundme page and every other way to support him someone had to step up. Glad he did.
Well Kyle will be going from biting 😬 the pillow to riding the pillow 😴
only in the US. those people easily raise $2mill for help a criminal who killed 2 people. meanwhile homeless people and animals all around the country.
Why are we all living in a South Park episode?
Rittenhouse is a hero and a patriot!
this is awesome! lets go patriots
Lol he was like “here’s the deal.. I’ll help you if you swear to use my pillows and my pillows only”
LMAO good for mypillow lmao
Good. That guy dosent deserve to be in jail. He was attack by a mob of worthless trash. Justified.
But...why?
Imagine how the victims families feel. They see the crazy pillow guy and the silver spoon has been smiling like they done a good deed getting this crazed shooter out before Christmas. My prayers go out to the victims families who will only have their loved ones memories this Christmas and this vision of the shooter smiling with two of the lowest human beings on this earth. smh
He should be out of jail.  He was protecting himslef
Thank God for these American Patriots who helped get Kyle out.🙏🇺🇲
That kid is good role model material.  True patriot, the kind who make up our silent militias.
Hero!!!
Imagine showing this news story to someone 30 years ago.
Sounds white
Good
This guy was acting in self defense where I come from
Here is an idea that needs to go viral:  fact - every human body has some amount of staphylococcus.  Who is to say that every human does not also contain some amount of corona?  Thus all the "positive" cases.  Perhaps TPTB picked something they knew tests would pick up in a large percentage of the population, just by virtue of it being a part of human physiology, and then blew it up into something that is isn't, and bolstered their fraud by labeling all normal flu, pneumonia and everything else as COVID deaths.  And as to the loss of taste & smell, my son swears that happened to him in previous year's flu.  Perhaps it's happened to us all, but we are so busy trying to evacuate the phlegm out of our lungs, that it did not register with us.  Please copy and paste thus far and wide.
LETS GO!
Three losers
If he was colored....
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2_AhdLVcsc COGNITIVE DISSONANCE
Not For Kids❌ https://youtu.be/An7igdPO22Q
Buy 2 bails, get 1 free, with my pillow you can comfortably relax, while you await trial?! ... 😀 🔥
😂😂😂 self defense in a unnecessary situation. Let the police deal with the riots. You arent the judge or jury.
Glad to see he is out on bail.
Looks like will be buying a my pillow
ONLY BECAUSE HE’S WHITE
Good
They should give him a medal
wth!!! he literally murdered someone!!!!
So many uninformed people in the comments who haven't seen all the footage which clearly shows self defense....
Sad
He was acting in self defense. Any body with a brain would have done the same thing. He should have  never been jailed what's wrong with the dam justice system there they must be morons.
he was acting in self defense, that is plain as day...
Yayyy kyle rittenhouse 2020
That my pillow guy always creeped me out. Not sure why.
SELF DEFENSE
Cool
Shoot two Communists dead, get a lifetime supply of pillows
Great news! Great performed self defense!
Looks like I'm not buying any of his Sh!$ty pillows for xmas!!
To the liberals who are claiming “but he killed two people!” WATCH the full video, Rosenbaum threatened him with a Molotov while shouting “So shoot me n***a!” and then grabbed his assault rifle, shots were fired BEFORS Rittenhouse fired AND called 911. The protestors ran at him, one with a handgun and another with a skateboard, Rittenhouse tripped (actually, he was tripped up), the guy with the skateboard attempted to swig at him and got shot in the chest, then the armed guy comes up, points his gun at Rittenhouse and loses 80-90% of the blood in his arm. ALL three guys who were shot were CONVICTED FELONS and they vandalized property, this was straight up self defense.
He KILLED PEOPLE!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!
🇺🇸🤘🏻

BLACK RIFLE COFFEE TRUE PATRIOT SCREW FAKE NEWS
Plot twist the My Pillow guy did all of this for a publicity stunt in order to get more people to buy his failing garbage pillows 🤣🖕👌
Okay have fun walking the streets 🙌🏽 your face is known
Wow, from smoking meth, to making pillows, to smoking more meth and setting murderers free. Keep wearing that cross upside down, Mike. We all know we’re you’re going.
Kyle is that annoying little boy who does to much to be seen in a different light then what he sees himself as...saying he’s an EMT when he’s not doing interviews even people on his side told him to chill out you’re doing to much
I saw the videos. He was
#KyleRittenhouse is a true Patriot and should be treated as such!
Have any of you seen the video of rittenhouse beating up a girl? Such a patriot lol.
It’s about time. Give that boy a break. He was standing up for what he believe was right and only fired the weapon when threatened.
He's not a killer he's a speaker of the free people who are tired of black supremecy and wants to end the terror of blm and antifa and destroy the corrupt radical left
In Joe Biden's America, Hunter Biden will be the new My Pillow guy. Mike Lindell will be sent to   a re-education camp. All My Pillow products will be manufactured in China by enslaved Uyghurs and  12 year old children. The My Pillow dog bed will be discontinued as it will no longer be needed as ur dogs will be sent to China to be consumed by hungry communists. My Pillow prices will be increased so the Big Guy can get his percentage.
Comment section is full of pillow talk
Because he was.
Disgusting. So gross. He killed people. Why are these people helping a murderer?
WTH why are people making jokes this dude killed 2 people and is now out on bail like seriously is money is greater than peoples lives. throw this psycho back in jail
So glad he's out 🙌😊
BASED COMMENTS!
Kyle live from his cell. - "Whoah there jamal don't pull out my pillow."
Of course he would have a BRCC shirt!
It’s funny they mentioned that the pillow guy is a trump supporter... what does the pillow guys political views have to do with anything? Smh garbage
Awesome
angry person: HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT!!?? Kyle: Funny thing is....
Now I have a good reason to bogo pillow. Promo code trump2020!
I'm glad he's out he defended himself with our 2nd amendment! I would of done the same!
Living the good old american joke 🇺🇸
Wtf !???????
Nothing better than killing someone and smiling In a photo....merica
Absolutely Discussing.
This was an act by a right wing militia that drove from out of the area to stick their nose in where it doesn’t belong
Out on bail, fresh Outta jail Wisconsin Dreamin. As soon as he step on the scene you hear those leftist screamin.
i don't understand why people say it was self defense. he crossed state lines to go to a protest he had no intentions to participate in, with a LOADED gun, as a MINOR. he put himself in that situation.
...just seems like a celebration of killing...
John 3.16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6.23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen. Repent and turn to God!!!! Time is running out!
😠😠😡😡🤬🤬🤬😓😓😓🤦🤦🤦
So many pillow jokes. But seriously he wouldn't be in this situation if he had  A: Gone and not brought guns  Or B: Minded his own business and stayed home It's Kyle's fault why 2 people are dead and why he's facing charges
I knew pillow guy was bad
Brought to you by My Pillow the trusted name in comfort, so comfy you might just lie down and never wake up 😜.
Nice job protecting yourself 👍👍. Hats off
Surprised at how chill these comments are.  Almost as chill as the other side of my pillow.
Ok, this video was pointless... but the comment section! 😂 👍
How can you tell what is real and what is fake?  If it is from NBC there is a 99% chance it is fake.  Move on folks.  You can't believe ANYTHING NBC says.
The fact this comment section is peaceful is mind blowing.
Glad to see Kyle Rittenhouse finally out on bail he should have never even been charged clearly self defense .
God bless you for helping him.
Bruh a whole third of the vid is nothing and the rest is me looking for drama in the comments and only seeing pillow joke
donating my mypillow rn lol
Making this guy a hero when 2 people died at his hands. This creep is nothing but a bloody murderer!! No thought for the dead peoples families how they cry every day, how hard the holidays will be coming up, America is so full of ugly cancer!! Rotten bloody murderer!!
Better enjoy it while he can. He still have to confront the murder charges.
He will walk. Unlike Jacob Blake.
Nearly twice the amount of thumbs up as thumbs down, and on a liberal media channel. Yet they expect us to believe Trump lost the election??? I don't think so!
Good for him
Idk what to say
No justice no peace..
He’s going to prison for killing those people
Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero
For the best eternal sleep in the whole wide world, it's Kyle Rittenhouse *POP* *POP*
Glad I didn't buy "'My Pillow".
“ on other news, chick- fil- a founder pays bail to the suspect who may have shot 8 in Milwaukee area mall. In deal, he has to claim in court his motive was that his chick- fil- a sandwich that is so crispy good was stolen by one of his victims.”  That may as well have been the next story. It just is random nouns thrown together in an almost onion- like way.
How can he still be armed behind an officers back? Now if that doesn’t tell you something...
God Bless the Hero of Kenosha. He never should have been charged in the first place!
hero
little kid you lost in gods eyes an he still being merciful towards you i hate to break it u you young boy your white peers won't be
OJ jealous of all the endorsements fellow double-murder getting.
Like Bro : https://youtu.be/zm8olaPkSyA
So Ricky Schroder supports teenagers who illegally obtained firearms and shoot unarmed people at least we know where he stands.
A step in the right direction toward putting this to bed.
Disgusting.
How has humanity even survived this long????
On the flip side [pause for the laughter of cultured individuals], I wonder how the guys at Black Rifle are going to respond to the fact that this guy is within the ranks of their fandom....
CNN and MSNBC won'r report it, go figure
Awesome news, great job defending yourself against previous sexual offenders, we saw the video before hand of the guy trying to fight you they have nothing
Pillow talk
Why is Murder a Bailable offense? Wait....ah, I see, the Suspect is a  1. White  2. White Supremacist  3. Obese Turtle supporter. Oh well, Land of the Free (for Whites, that is)
1
That's why I bought a casper lol
Awesome!!! Good News Finally. Trump 2020!!
So u gone bond out some one who killed two innocent people thats what were doing now what is wrong with the world makes me sick
Politics aside, at this point you cannot convince me we aren’t living in a simulation, this is to ridiculous to be real
This is awesome! This young man is a hero to all Americans! Everyone needs to buy a pillow to show their support. I expect every real American to buy one!
Kyle will walk and should be thanked.
Note to self: get a My Pillow
Unbelievable.  I imagine the sentence will cure his smile.
I will never buy a my pillow.
he'll receive a blanket and bunk too
Anyone else think this kid is on the spectrum? When you look in his eyes its like hes not all there.
Good for him. He was in there longer than he should have been.
Why are we giving this man more airtime...he deserves none of this
https://youtu.be/58KLcxBFbLo
Guess I'm not getting that pillow now.
He should be found guilty and get 50 years.
I didnt know 17 year old babys can buy guns or watever be the case
He had to make a decision he was stuck between a pillow and a hard place
What even is reality
Kyle is a hero, he was being attacked by a pedofile and a felon. He did the world a favor
OMG if that had been a black kid they would have already given him the chair.
✝️KYLE✝️RITTENHOUSE✝️🐑🕊
So bummed Dune got pushed back. At least WW 1984 is free on HBO... that’s something... 🤷‍♂️🤘
This comment section is mostly peaceful
Oh I’m so excited a murder is free from jail yaaaay :)
What am I not getting
Kyle is a hero
WTF ?
hope that thug doesn't run and all that donation money is lost. hope everyone keeps that same energy and donate millions when it's a child with ebony color skin that goes to a riot during a curfew with a long gun and murders two people claiming to trying to help smh.
Oh So You're Approching Me? https://youtu.be/-JiA_5Uu4Rc
Hahahaha. Lets go get revenge now
There's gonna be some " my pillows" soaked with liberal tears....
THIS kid murdered 2 humans........for what?.. And u applaude this......this is what guns and idiots get u................death. ..
Hope he gets life. Coward.
There was really no need for this video, everything said in the video was pretty much in the title lol
Epic
I was working in a movie theater box office in an L.A. suburb in the late 1980s. Ricky Schroder, shortly after finishing Silver Spoons, came as part of a double date with Alfonso Ribeiro (Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). At that time, we sold adult tickets (ages 12 and up) for $5 and children tickets, I believe, for $2.50. Despite all of them clearly being adults, the girls themselves being around 18, Ricky and Alfonso paid adult prices for themselves and only children's prices for their dates. They wouldn't pay another $2.50. For over 30 years, I have thought Ricky Schroder was a cheap piece of sh*t. Boy, was I wrong! $150,000 to get a murderer out on bail, he's not cheap at all!  A piece of sh*t, yes, but not cheap!
Not really a claim to slef defense if there is video of them attacking him and him running away then shooting
Hero 🔥
I bet if this was a black guy they would’ve shown his mugshot instead of a picture them smiling
Heck yeah!  Good for him!  I'm going to get myself one of Mike's pillows
All the sudden we're bailing out domestic terrorist
So glad people are starting to realize that he was a law abiding citizen and had more balls than the cops to do what was right.
Dude was defending himself. But he is a dumbfuck for being there in the first place
Perfect example of white privilege
TODAY has to be censoring comments, no way its actually this peaceful. Or Twitter really is that garbage of a environment.
Good for Lindell! This poor young man was in fear for his life when That nasty far left gang and Antifa unlawfully broke up a peaceful rally and chased him to his vehicle and then proceeded to smash his vehicle with bats and other weapons . If only the Media would show entire videos and stop lying we wouldn't be seeing all this unrest today !!!
I will buy a MyPillow now😉😉😉
In the photograph, it looks like he is wearing a T-shirt from one of his sponsors.
Goes to show how ignorant even CEO’s of successful companies can be. The media is has been dividing this country for decades.
Them whites stick together
Disgusting
Reality is often stranger than fiction
TONS of CHINA AND IRAN POSTERS HERE PRETENDING TO BE AMERICANS.
Pretty sure he's not going to get a my pillow in the big house 🗣️ P.S. HE'S GOING BACK TO JAIL FOR A LONG TIME
I just bought a MY PILLOW AND SENT RICKY MY LOVE!
That racist pillow pig I’d rather sleep on a rock than his slave pillows
He wanna be infantry so bad,piece of Sh@t.
Im surprised anyone cares anymore , elections are over. No reason to politicize this. Pillows have better cases than this DA does....
Best comment section I've seen in weeks! :-)
286 anita terrace, antioch, IL. You're welcome, adventurists.
Wow
I bought 2 pillows from this company as soon as I saw the story!!
That’s what the video shows  SELF-DEFENSE I KNOW you hope he gets the chair But the evidence dose not back that up dumass
“… I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated with NO possibility of parole, for life!” ⚖️ 🔒 “Life? whale' ya' mean life? I ain't got a life!” “Boy, your soul better belong to Jesus, 'cause your a$$ belongs to me…” -Megadeth
SALUUUUUTE
America will never stop being racist and evil. Warning to people of color.
Good. Kid's a hero
The My Pillow guy is a close associate of Trump and Trump defends Rittenhouse without knowing all the facts. So there's probably more to the story about the $$$$ than meets the eye. I believe people are innocent before being proven guilty, but I don't believe that important public figures should DECLARE someone innocent and try to sway public opinion when they don't know all the facts. When this happens, it's hard for people to get a fair trial.
Disgusting publicity seeking pillow head and Schroeder at Rittenhause’s expense.
Ima buy a MyPillow
Ew
Yay, hope the lil cutie beats all the charges. 🥰
😁👍🇺🇲
Kyle rittenhouse is a hero. If you watched the full video in its entirety you would know this. This is what happens when the police are not allowed and prosecuted from doing their job.  I’m tired of everyone turning this into a black, white, brown thing. It’s a good and bad thing.
This just sad and disgusting.
I’m disgusted omg
Feel so bad for him

I just sighed in relief because this comment section super calm
Have you ever noticed that to defend yourself justly, is offensive? Ya me too.
It's Rick
Matthew 16:26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
Good he  deserves to be free and if you think protecting a community from rioters is a bad thing then your the problem with society.  He shot one guy after they chased him down the street and hit him with a skateboard...i mean wtf
GOOD FOR HIM!!! THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS ALL WHO USE IT.
When whites say white privilege doesn’t exist I’ll show them this video
Good for these guys for standing up for this young man. If you saw the video YOU KNOW he was acting in self defense and if he were an Antifa member he wouldn’t even be charged.. bless you Mike and Rick!!
Why do they need to point out hes a Trump supporter what makes that relevant to his bail
What a PR tool.
wow!!! SMH
MyPillow guy is just trying to.stay in the spotlight with his hero going down on 1/20/21.
Self defense is not a crime. Where are all the lefties who are against cash bail, locking kids in cages, and separating from their parents??
What's that thumbs up about? This photo is Very telling...
He needs to smile now because he is going to need a pillow to sit on in the near future.
"MURDER SUSUPECT" ...!?!?  YOU MSM COMMIES ARE SHAMELESS!
True Patriots !!  Prayers for you Kyle.
White privilege at its finest 😆
I'm still using my My-pillow every night 😂
Ok get him out thats your business but this situation should mean they are EDUCATING and REFLECTING GTFO I bet they take him for a fun time  with ya silver spoon lookn aces
$2 million bail? That's a lot of money to fork out for someone you don't know.
All trump supporters appear to be B list actors or washed up has beens
Finally some good news
I love trump supporters
They filled the gargantuan hole in that guys arms with my patented filling.
How can they sit there and Grin with him? Its still a Serious matter? What the he'll is wrong with folks?
Gunny how they point out My Pillow, yet he only gave 150,000.00
Bruh
I won’t be buying his products nope
Jacob Blake “protests”? They were riots!
This is a disgusting message to wolfs in sheep clothing.
Pathetic.  That kid should stay behind bars.
that is so 👍.
Kyle was defending himself. He should have been out.
he WAS acting in self defense.
Mike Lindell is an angel, Kyle  Rittenhouse is a hero and President Trump is Gods warrior 🥰 Love them all 💖
Good a American hero set free
Im going to buy a Mypillow just to say it gives me neck pains so I can sue the company and say "It's self defense, it hurt me first"
You can put this story to rest...on My Pillow!
Should of used the new, Killing them softly - Assault pillow.
Well i'm m not going to buy those pillows again
This is just so messed up!
Ummm it was self defense....
During the Jacob Blake riots* and remember, he lawfully got shot people. Sorry but personal accountability comes first in this situation.
Pillow guy is smart, I'm seriously buying his pillows now. Go kyle! I'm sure his first meal out tasted great!
I'm glad I have never purchased a pillow or any product from this racist.  I will make sure to pass this information to friends and family to ensure we will never support these people.
Let's do the My Pillow guy like the republicans did the Dixie Chicks.  Burn his pillows to the ground.
God bless Mr. Lindell.  God bless Kyle.  He was about to be murdered by leftist animals, and any human who took the time to watch the video would see it.  Today show, disgusting filth, spinning it as Kyle was the cause of harm.  Liars.
He should’ve never went to jail
Hope he’s charged.
I would love to see him WRECKED in prison.
Finally out! Self defense is not against the law.
You'll get yours you pos
I want a my pillow now, pay attention companies of the world, democrat supporters are mostly out of work, how did you think they protested every day vacation days lol.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3alLlPjTX1I&feature=youtu.be
All these headlines sound like snl skits at this point
He did nothing wrong.
Awesome!!!  He did nothing but shot bad guys to defend himself.  Get over it!!
Why
There's a reason Rick Schroder hasn't been able to find much work lately.  Maybe David A.R. White is hiring?
And holy crap. Ricky Schroder is still alive?
My Pillow pillow is going in the trash. Schroeder..just black.  Nothing like supporting a teenager who kills people.
Kyle Rittenhouse is a true american hero. I wish I was there with him. Only way to take back this country is to take the trash out to the street, and if the trash is coming at you, fire at will.
We know what it is thinking about oneself, it’s really going round and round in circles, either expanding the ego or contracting the ego. One has to understand why the brain is so caught up in words not the significance of the word but just the word, this requires careful watching.
It was self defense. If you think otherwise, I feel sorry for you.
He's just a kid
This country is truly terrifying. Conservatives go on and on about "crimnals with guns" but which they mean b lack people yet they have raised this kid to god like status. All because he killed liberals. They try to justify it by saying "one had a criminal record" but how would he have know that when he was killing hm?
Awesome. He should be free!!!
I’m glad he’s out! Can’t wait for him to be found not guilty cause of self defense!
Absolutely Disgusting.  Murderer    Life in Prison
Put the KID in jail. He doesn't understand how guns work.
Thank god
He WAS "acting in self defense."  Don't these stupid TV people actually watch video?  Young Rittenhouse was clearly being attacked and defending himself.   QUESTION:  Why did it take so long to post his bail?  Why is Mike Lindell the only person patriotic enough to want to get Kyle out of jail? Somebody help me out here.
Disgusting 🤮 🤢
Loser😂
Thats awesome!!!
DEATHANGEL 186 😜😜😜😜😜maybe u should STFU o u have FREEDOM OF SPEECH!!!!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉
he did nothing wrong
“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong.When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief,the new evidence cannot be accepted.it would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable,called COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.And because it is so important to protect the core belief,they will RATIONALIZE,IGNORE and even deny anything that doesn’t fit in with the core belief “…FRANTZ FANON
Kyle should be in a prison cell for murder.
Take that you f'ing commies
Good
This kid murdered two people. Why are there so many sociopaths making light of this in the comments?
3 Patriots! Much ❤️
Good for him!
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏💐😊💝💝
Wtf?
American hero
PERFECT Murder two people and become a star hob-nobbing with the rich and famous.
So the message is that it is okay for a 17 year old male to carry a weapon a cross another state.  Only to killed 2 people at a rally who were unarmed.  First who asked him to cone to that state and bring his weapon? Is not illegal to carry a firearm a cross another state and not have it register?  He had to know that when he carry that weapon he was going to use it. That was his intent.  I am not against the second amendment but in this case it does nor apply to him.  His mother should have never drove him to that state. His mother said at one point she didn't know he had the weapon. That is BS.  He should have never been there in the first place it was not his place to be there.
Thanks mike I have one of your pillows, it's actually pretty nice! perfect to rest your head on after dealing with some antifa clowns
Garbage.
Mmmmmmmm, feels like some people with nothing better to do want their children to go off into war, a civil war. Screw you all.
How can anyone say “Praise God” or “My prayers go to him and his family”? He took two lives.
Now I know I can get a good nights sleep
Not a good look for black rifle coffee
I’m happy he is getting help he shouldn’t be in jail he was under attack at the moment
I knew there was no way he paid a bond that expensive on his own or from a regular person
He went looking for trouble and found it, actually he caused it by murdering two unarmed civilians
Whelp. Screw Mike Patton.
Are you Effin kidding me!
Glad he's out 👍
Now he needs a power legal team. He is still up against 1st degree murder charges.
The three dickheads. The my pillow junkie and a washed up actor are coming to the aid of a murderer.  2020
Ricky Schroeder? WTF? How did he get mixed up in this? Lol
You mean killed to criminals
He’s so so ugly.
Schools need to teach less SJW stuff and more common sense, reason, and logic. Like don't attack someone who is holding a gun. I mean how stupid!
This country is nuts lmfao I love it
Please read the whole message, even if you’ve been saved.  First accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior; confess that He suffered and died for your sins on the cross. Then start repenting of your sins because we all have sinned and transgressed God's laws. Read the received texts like KJV and keep God's 10 Laws which includes Sabbath (resting from Friday Sunset until Saturday Sunset[7th day{Genesis 2:2-3}]). The Bible teaches that thee Antichrist is the Papacy. The mark of the beast is Forced Sunday rest & the banning of Sabbath [7th day] Rest. It takes courage to be in the army of Christ. The battle lines are drawn: you either choose God by keeping Sabbath or Satan by keeping Sunday. We will go through persecution and tribulation and Satan isn’t stupid, don’t underestimate Him; He can transform himself into an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14): He won’t be coming in like some angel of darkness and his ministers of darkness will portray themselves as ministers of righteousness. Satan is showing all this evil to then come in as the good guy for you to join in unity in error—but you’ll think you’ll be worshipping God. Satan uses a lot of truth and mixes a little bit of error for your destruction. People will think they’re doing God’s work when they persecute God’s Sabbath keeping people. My brothers and sisters in Christ in the Catholic Church, those in Sunday keeping churches and for people that don’t know Jesus but are looking for the way, the life and truth—please come out of Babylon and repent of your sins before it's too late! But don't trust what I say; read and study the Bible to find out. I know what I said sounds harsh, I’m not trying to be, and I mean this with the upmost respect and kindness towards you and all of God’s beautiful creation of mankind—both in the body of Christ and outside the body of Christ. God bless!   Sabbath day was not created for Israel: As God's people they needed to keep His Law's because God chose them. It was created before Israel and it's for all mankind who choose the True Living God, through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ. Us Christians call Jesus King, which He is: A King has laws for His kingdom; 10 Perfect Laws our God created, which includes Sabbath (A day He sanctified, so you can’t say there’s any day of the week to rest with God: The day He set is the seventh day), and are part of His character. So if you choose Sunday rest when it's enforced (Mark of the beast) by the Antichrist (Roman Catholic Papacy—read Daniel 2&7&8 and Revelation 13 for information on the antichrist and the core of Bible Prophecy to understand):you are then breaking our Kings’ Laws. Keeping and resting on Sabbath along with, if you can congregate, always will mean you are choosing God and His authority in your life. Choosing Sunday now, since it hasn't been enforced, means you're knowingly or unknowingly choosing Satan's authority. But many will say, well Paul and the others broke bread on the first day of the week... Yeah you should worship God everyday and break bread with your brothers and sisters in Christ every once in a while, but Sabbath is the day of rest, hallowed and sanctified by God: The Seal to His Laws. The whole Bible says basically if you love God then keep his Commandments. Jesus died on the cross (Grace and Pardon) because we have sinned (transgressed His Law's[1 John 3:4]). So it's all about God's laws and Jesus saving us from our sin (His Sacrifice to pardon us and to save us for the Transgression of Gods’ Laws). Oh and yes, we are free from the Mosaic & Ceremonial laws when He died on the cross, but not God's Laws (Ten Commandments are in Exodus Chapter 20): we still keep them. We are saved by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ: We keep Gods’ Laws as a consequence of being saved. Love you, God bless.   The book of Daniel in the Old Testament is the key to truly understanding the Book of Revelation; make sure to remember that every day in prophecy equals a year (Ezekiel 4:6 & Numbers 14:34). Book of Revelation is a chiasmus {[Looks like this(\/)](\Historical&Eschatological/)}also; this information will help you to understand the makeup of the way Revelation is written, along with The Book of Daniel. God bless with your search for truth (The word of God, Ten Commandments, and Jesus is the way, the truth and the life) my brothers and sisters in Christ—ask God in prayer what truth is and to ask for the spirit of prophecy, and for help to understand His Word. People that say it’s okay to break Sabbath and to keep Sunday or other days is an enemy of God; however, many have been deceived and God understands, please ask God for spiritual discernment. Don’t trust me, only Trust Jesus Christ, His Word and His Commandments. God bless!  P.S. Look up Total Onslaught with Walter Veith and Discover Prophecy with David Asscherick: Two lecture series for those who don’t have any understanding of Biblical Prophecy and those that do have some knowledge of prophecy and the war that’s going on; other great lectures for you to watch are Rekindling the Reformation, Darkness before Dawn, and In the stream of Time—all by Walter Veith, also watch this wonderful series called What’s up Prof with Walter Veith and Martin Smith as they use the Word of God and apply it to modern things going on for the times we live in now.  It’s okay to hate me and I know I repeat myself a lot, that’s how important God wants you to know about keeping His Ten Laws including Sabbath, but please don’t hate the Truth— if it’s Truth, then it’s worth buying. I’m not better or wiser, I’m most pathetic, but because God cares about you and He is wanting seeds of truth to be in your heart for when you see the blatant truth of what really is going on, God shall be your growth and His Word a Lantern unto your feet in the spiritually dark world we live in. Please love your enemies that do great evil towards you, we are no better, we are all sinners. Please share this message if you want to.   Revelation 14:6-12  6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. 8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

Anyone that wants the real facts from that night go to Donut Operators channel and watch his video breakdown of everything that transpired that night!
That young boy deserves a Congress Medal.
He's had no business going across state lines getting a gun and doing what he did.He's 17 I hope he gets tried as an adult.There are child murders getting tried as one he should too.
All charges should be dropped
The kid is innocent.
SO happy for Kyle and his family!! Praying for you all.🙏
Well at least the state got the money lol!
Trump should give him a full pardon
Based Pillow Man
Just put it out there if he was a different color he'd still be in jail
Do not spend your money with my pillow guy.
You have to be a major sociopath to be smiling after murdering two people.
This kid looks way too young to be: a) a trump supporter, b) carrying a rifle, c) murdering people. This whole business of bail should be outlawed. There's no excuse for this kid accused of murder should be out of jail. Only people with money can bail their buddies out. The poor get nothing.
Wow America!!!
These comments are colder than the other side of the pillow
I need a rittenhouse My Pillow!
Lol... Ricky Schroder had to fanboy a murderer to get back in TV...
Just cancelled my order for these pillows... Gladly...
So nice to hear. Drop the charges!!
So you think it’s awesome smiling at the camera after you killed somebody 😕 Your lucky your white
It's about time he got out on bail.  Obvious case of self defense.
The My Pillow guy is an example of everything that is wrong with America now.
Killed men who were rioting, who attacked him in self defense.
Yes!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Looks astonishingly  happy for someone who murdered two people in cold blood.
The videos show he had a minor verbal skirmish but the man turned away and walked away and Rittenshouse FOLLOWED him & killed him. The other two were trying to apprehend him for the police. No self defense in either case.
R they using this to laundry their money lol
These are terrorists and should be sent to GITMO
Yeah
this is the face of a cold blodded KILLER
Bro lmfaoooooooo he gon get gunned down
Killer on bail...............Wow
That kid's in for it either way.
He’s gonna be rightfully exonerated anyway so why not let him out now.
i really hate the us. where you can pay your way out of trouble. capatalism at its finest
That's what the video shows.
Yo got bailed out by a crack head.
Totally self defense
Funny how the only people shot were the ones actively attacking Rittenhouse. It’s as if assaulting a visibly armed person is incredibly stupid and reckless. It also vindicates his decision to show up armed in the first place. He took a few blows but avoided serious injury in a brutal mob boot party thanks to his rifle.
Thank god for fellow patriots to see the injustices done against real Americans. You are all communist, racist, stupidest group of people who have ever took a breath on this planet.
I will buy a set of MY PILLOW now.
I love my pillow more now !!!
It was self-defense you morons that  Kid look like a killer to you give me a freaking break
i'm sure they totally would have done this if he was black, right?
Self D
Self defense with a AR15?? Nah don’t buy it..
Its not a protest if you're rioting, at that point it would just be called a riot. Dumbasses.
Kyle shot three domestic terrorists. Two were members of Antifa. Kyle did nothing wrong.
Kyle is a true patriot, I’m clad he did it . I have respect for Mr. lindell , he’s a true Catholic Christian and the leftist evil hates him for it.
Plot twist: this whole thing is an elaborate My Pillow advertisement
Kyle is a hero
Good!
Drove across state line to act in self defense... sure 🤦🏻‍♂️
Wow, was expecting war in the comments, but surprisingly is calm
Well, I know who not to buy pillows or whatever the corrupt man sells from. Self defense Is not  going across state lines with a gun that was illegal for him to have and starting it by shooting someone and then shooting to people who were trying to prevent him from escaping. That is not self defense, that is a racist brat rewarding a killer for killing non whites
How can a father be proud of teaching his son to be a terrorist, in its own country carrying rifle and shooting people intentionally ,  if it wasn't intentionally why would he have been with a rifle out there in the first place.  At  least he will provide the pillows in jail for him for the rest of his life.
A 17 yr old had no business going there with a gun.  Evidently he couldn't handle the situation. But no excuse for killing 2 people. Shame on his parent(s) and shame on people for excusing his behavior.  Just think of this ... what would have happened if he were a minority?
2020+++trumptrain,,, God bless.u.s.a....1776,,
Kyle was attacked, so he shot in self defense.
American patriot
THAT’S A LOT OF MONEY FOR SOMEONE BASED ON HIS SKIN COLOR
Stand your ground law.
sad, very sad
I won't need a new pillow for a very long time.
If this kid were black or muslim i wonder if white people would still feel the same way.
Guilty haha
Kid's a hero.
Both of these aswipes should be locked up...the 17 year old needs to be put in supermax . the "my Pillow" charlatan is a FRAUD...involved with Fake Corona Virus cures.
Wow...
Privilege in America is alive and well, It's simply unbelievable and amazing the grace that's given to them no matter what the crime ! 🤮
YEAHHHH BOIIII
Kyle soon to be Kylie .... sleep well !
Kyle Rittenhouse is a Patriot. He never should of went to jail, he should of received a Medal of Honor.
Kyle Rittenhouse is a legend.
if he was black, he'd still be in jail. this is what white privilege looks like
Lol
Anyone who helped let this killer out of jail is just as bad as he is.
Are you serious
Typical these white boys are never held accountable for their actions!
The My Pillow Guy contributed $1,999,999.99 and Schroder found a penny underneath his couch and threw that in.
disgusting .
He did nothing wrong, self defense
Kyle for pres
I sleep better knowing Kyle Rittenhouse is out there doing good.
Whos got more money flex seal guy or pillow guy?
good job.  self defense clearly he'll be freed forever.  thanks ricki and michael...
Murderer bailed out by a guy who sells chinese pillows and an actor that pretends to be rich.. what could possibly be more republican?
This kid is my spirit animal. God bless you buddy.
Wow the Facebook crowd is strong here.
Not murder. self defence. get it right.
He is Innocent that’s ridiculous $2 million and all these Jack running around hurting people so sad
Hmmm, did Today report on Kamala Harris donating to organizations that bail out criminals, arsonists, rioters and looters?
Who cares. It's all short lived. I want to see Dog TBH go after him and take him down. That will be sooo funny and would make good crap tv.
These White people😒
A 17 yr old had no business going there with a gun.  Evidently he couldn't handle the situation. But no excuse for killing 2 people. Shame on his parent(s) and shame on people for excusing his behavior.  Just think of this ... what would have happened if he were a minority?
That is seriously a cool thing Ricky Schroeder did.  Personally I don’t feel the teen did anything wrong and doesn’t deserve jail
To Kyle A Mockingbird
Yeah my pillow founder is cancelled
He should be biting a pillow instead...
When you get rewarded for murder 🤦🏼‍♂️
Bruh
Trash people ✨
Wait WHAT?! I need to sleep on this 😂
Well... I just bought 2 new pillows.
Lord give me strength
Glad to know the parents are proud of him killing people rather than studying for school.
White guy kills ,2 million dollar bail Colored person kills someone no bail
On a real note, can anyone justify spending 40$ on a pillow? I cant.
Ricky Schroeder is still alive?
Four months shooting this 12 minute video? Is this the most unusual use of quarantine time you've ever seen? ======= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Q6VcMsmS8
Kyle is innocent
Heck yeah!
The tRump cultists keep trying to get us to actually watch the evidence and videos. As if you need proof to know that a tRump supporter is always guilty.
It’s not illegal to drop commies
Y'all ready for more riots and looting?
I mean he was being attacked soooooo
Its okay give it 6 months and Kyle will go trigger happy for a target not having his PS5
He will get his day in court
Wow bail raise! But if this was a Mexican or African American who was literally defending themselves, you wouldn't here about it nor would people raise your bail.
in the past .. sick boys do closer to home as next target
Wasnt his gun illegal? Isn't that was Republicans fight for? Punishing "people" doing things illegal? Unconfuse me lol
Wtf
My hero 💖 Glad you're out, Kyle!

Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and died for ALL our sins and raised up proving who He is and that  is God in human form and you're given the free Gift of eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Christ has done for us.

I love america. Where you can pay to free a murderer, even if that's for a short time.
Next he'll tape that pillow to his barrel of his Ar
Well after he gets sentenced for his crimes at least he'll have an opportunity to interact in a socially diverse community, get more acquainted with other races, i.e Blacks Latino Muslims. This will give him the opportunity to get close and more personal with his pillow from "My Pillow" while his new prison friends take turns prodding and injecting him with their large and bold perspective... of prison life.
Calling this baby a hero is sad
Good reasons to call the murderer "The victim". Illegally crossed state lines with a weapon, shot at 3 people and killed 2 and yes of course ,he's the victim.
Smiling posing with a murderer smh
Keep him in jail smh
And he was acting in self defence he was getting jumped by 4 people
Kyle deserves a medal and given the same license as 007.
We buy that coffee on the shirt he has on 🤔
who gave 2 million dolla to him? all this is so suspecious
The media never talks when a young Black man kills an innocent Anglo-American child that way. Why is that?
Schroeder will never see another acting job in Hollywood.
This is sick!
Kyle the kid!
too bad for him...he is a much easier target for people being out of jail, he was safe in jail.....Lindell is not a christian,,,he is a Satan worshiper...Good thing these are state charges....if not... tRump would pardon him in January
#FreeRKelly
There's a bill going through that will tax bullets 2500%. Keep your killing machines ammosexuals...now start paying for your destruction. No job for Kyle No girlfriend BUT He's got "my pillow guy" to prove his worth to. I wonder what that looks like. Eww.
Guess it’s time for me to buy a My Pillow now
Fun Racist gets bailed out by other Racists. The man is a Murder and should never have brought a gun there he had plenty of intent. #DemocracyisDead
So the right rags on Robert Deniro one of the greatest actors of all time for calling out Trump, but meanwhile their “team” has Ricky Schroeder and Scott Baio, let that sink in, lol!
based pillow man
I'm glad my $100 donation was a part of this
I was so upset while writing is I miss spelled “ Trump loving”.
This is the meaning of white privileged because if the roles was the other way no one would send a single penny to help a black or Hispanic man for killing two people
A GUN SAVED A PATRIOT FROM TERRORISTS HE WOULD BE DEAD IF.....
Claiming to be in self defense? When he tripped on the ground one guy yelled “get him!” And they attacked him. The mans a hero
Once convicted he will be biting his perfect pillow ....
Kyle defended himself in a situation of Antifa's creation.  The young man was trying to do good with a whole lot of legal adults who just insisted on breaking the law.  American Hero.
Wecome Home Kyle..American HERO!
...or they going to cancel pillows?...
I thought Kyle was a killer, but these comments really had me dead
HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE
Oh boy here we go
Now that’s sum real comfort
Congratulations Kyle!!!
NBC is part of the problem.
That’s just wrong!!
Kyle Rittenhouse you are my HERO!!!
Thumbs down for not also show Kyle being attacked when he tripped and fell while running away. FAKE NEWS strikes again!
Woohoo 🥳 for Kyle!!! Most patriotic thing 👏
Thank God Kyle finally out!!! Kyle did more for our rights than the thousands of rioters burning down our nation.
That’s not the issue the issue is he was being attacked and he was defending himself
Hey mike, how are you doing, so you’re here to tell everyone about my pillow?! https://youtu.be/3alLlPjTX1I
Just don't let Kyle's judge and jury be decided by the democrats and their Dominion voting machines!!!!  Best of luck Kyle, we're still pulling for you!
Kyle is an agitator and those folks he killed would still be alive had he stayed  his busted muffin faced *ss at home.
Is that a NEW Black Rifle Coffee Company T-shirt!  Jail time = TOTALLY worth it. The written house rules are: 1, Rittenhouse Rulz
Dude who sprays at people with an AR posts bail while dude asleep in his car who allegedly used a counterfeit bill goes to an early grave.
No remorse on his face. That's dangerous to our society.
It’s a good thing Trump can’t pardon Rittenhouse from a state crime or he would.
Of course he was acting in self defense. The state made a cool 2 million on his wrongful imprisonment. Mr. Lindell and Mr. Schroeder should get their money back when he's found innocent of protecting his own life.
I know where Rottenhouse lives...but I'm not going to vox the poor kid...the public will have a round with him soon enough.
One more thing...forget getting a girlfriend Kyle. Well, there are plenty of Fat Donnie lickers to choose from...gorgeous they are!
The My Pillow Guy needs a friend...someone to hold, nourish, bathe, blow. Well, Rottenhouse is his dude. Fresh out of jail...my guess Kyle learned a LOT about the human anatomy.
If you buy one, get one free who's next??
He did the right thing against criminals and riots that were destroying the city. Self defense
He will still be in court, so will the person that provided a firearm to the teen.
Trumpeters guiltily wow
Obviously politics outweighs all.  Pillow guy claims religiousity. Which religion teaches Ritt will not be held accountable to his Creator for murder?
Good for him
This KID SHOT 3 Kids and you set a 2 mil bail ???? If he was black you wouldn’t even give him bail lmao
Now that Kyle is free, the fight for his own freedom is just beginning.
Can’t trust these cave dwellers
If you chase a person with a gun and then when he falls try kicking him in the head and hitting him with a skateboard. And you get shot for trying to assault him ITS YOUR OWN DUMB FAULT . AND IF YOU ALSO BELIEVE EVERYTHING THE. MSM TELLS YOU WITHOUT LOOKING INTO IT YOURSELF. ITS YOUR OWN FAULT YOUR BEING MISLEAD
Bailed out by MP, advertises for Black Rifle Coffee?  How rude!!! 🤣
This kid is the real john Rambo they drew first blood
There you go NOW YOU KNOW HOW ALL THE HOLLYWOOD JERKOFFS & THE GOOD TRUMP SUPPORTING CONSERVATIVE AMERICANS FEEL ABOUT YOU POC...
It is not a claim moron.  He 2as acting in self defense.
What ever happened to pillow fights?
A free pillow for every pedophile killed...
Time to boycott My Pillow. Always thought he was a little out there.
He can be out, glad he will never get a job.
You're welcome back my American Hero
To get you up to speed, the media portrays this kid as someone who did something wrong, not true!  He was defending himself. The media lies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As far as BRCC they claim no association because they are smart business people. But if u bothered to read Mat Best's book u would clearly see that killing bad guys is pretty much his favorite activity
What is wrong with you Americans he isn't a vet to celebrate him, he shot 2 of your own countrymen.🙄🙏
Man with 4 mustaches says...  Kyle Rittenhouse will be cleared from all charges.   Nuff said’.  And...  #JesusisLord
My pillow guy did the right thing,  I am going to buy his pillow to support him.
I'm a Trump supporter...  AND!!! the fact that the majority of these comments are pillow jokes..  Warms my soul 😎😍😎👍
good he doesnt deserve to be in jail in the first place
The hero we need 👏🏼
Good kids a hero.
Let that boy be
Good, he doesn’t deserve to be in jail.
He's getting a little break before he goes on forever, I bet he'll try and flee the country after he's found guilty. All they have to do is play the 911 call Kyle made where he admits he just murdered someone.
THEY FREED MY DUDE
You will not attack us without us deffending ourselves.Every Democrat is a communist enemy of America.
Kyle is as cool as the other side of the pillow
such a tragedy. let the little boy rot in jail. He should never have had that gun in the first place. Not old enough to legally buy it himself so he gets a friend to do it. If he didnt have that gun those people probably would have been alive today. then as well running away after he shot those people what a winner he is.
Voter fraud in many places! Even by AOC and Crazy Bernie!  Heads are gonna roll!
Great news
In 2018, Wisconsin legislatures passed a measure that made it illegal to buy a gun with the intent to give it to a person who is prohibited from having it. Wisconsin law also states a gun buyer must provide truthful information on the notification form when making the purchase.
I had a dream last night that I ate this giant marshmallow. When I woke up my pillow was gone. 😂
Armed Violent Marxist (Antifa, Anarchist, BLM) communists burning and looting supported by stupid Democrats and MSM Fake News. This kid was only defending himself. You Trash Actors on a "Fictional TV show" disguised as news. Down with MSM Fake News. And Big Tech acting like the CCP. No communism in the USA.
Time to get ready for the civil war this should be fun
We all know if the shoe was on the otha foot their would have been NO BAIL! NO JUSTICE NO PEACE! Karma will await him.
Who knew a pillow could get ahead....
Why tf did my pillow guy bail him out though are they related?
This guy really knows how to put people to sleep.... permanently. Try interviewing the two guys taking a dirt nap for eternity.
And if Kyle Rittenhouse was a black BLM activist shooting a white Trump supporter, the media would be hailing him as a hero.  Thank you Mike Lindell and Rick Schroeder and Kyle Rittenhouse for the courage each of you have shown.
Make all the hooplah you want but...that "kid" going to prison a long time.
Kyle will be 6 feet under pillows soon.
He removed some leftist scum, that just happened to be pedos also that's a win in my book ! 👍👌🐸
Those “protesters” shouldn’t have brought knives to a gun fight. Along with spray paint bricks and torches!
Good, innocent  untill proven guilty , something the media prefer  to ignore.
Kyle Rittenhouse freed on bail.  Acted in self-defense after being attacked by BLM and ANTIFA terrorists.   There-fixed your headline.
Well done!
I don't know much about the actual case but it is extremely ballsy to assign your name to someone with those kinds of charges.  Not sure I would do it but if they believe he is innocent and have the money I guess it's a free world and you can do what you wish with your money.
Disgusting
I'm never watching Silver Spoons Again
I knew that there was a reason I never brought any pillows from this guy
Kyle is innocent!
Good for him! He will be exonerated of all bogus charges.
Hero's don't deserve to be locked up
Well I read all of the morons comments, and that was every comment here. The kid is out on bail, I'm glad for him. And Pedophile Rosenbaum was killed by his own guys, shot in the back and it went through his lung, Rittenhouse's fire was non threatening. But you idiots are too stupid to do any kind of research. TRUMP20FOREVER BABY KYLE RITTENHOUSE FOR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Thank you Ricky Schroeder and Pillow-man! Real Americans!
When he gets to prison for murder, I imagine that his face will be buried in a pillow often as he takes one for the team.
I glad he home
The two Bubbas? I sure hope not.
Those two victims ran after him because Rittenhouse shot a man minutes earlier
my boy is free!!
Self defense 🤔, when you literally walked outside with an assault rifle.
Wow!!..how lucky can you be..look at'm he's cool as the other side of a pillow!!
He was acting in self-defense, it's not just a 'claim'. Has Today ever showed the raw footage of several people trying to hunt this kid down in the middle of the street? Of course they haven't.
You know the whole situation is bad yes but you have to watch the video and you must see that this dude was defending himself even though people died that is how it must be
Good for him. Protecting the American way of life and himself from theAntifa/BLM terrorists. Its legal to shoot them. They no longer have citizenship here. It was revoked when they were declared terrorists. Rittenhouse is a true american
The Jacob Blake “protests”... *cough cough* RIOTS! Do your job media.
Glad Kyle’s out he was only protecting himself. Video evidence, but if you’re not a Democrat you get thrown under the bus.So sick of the news protecting the criminals they need to be put in jail. You go Kyle God bless you and God bless the people that put up the money to help get you out.  this world is corrupt and Trump is cleaning the swamp. 🇺🇸❤️Trump 2020🇺🇸❤️
Boycott “my pillow”!!!
Gosh, now we know who the Racists are. I encourage every Person of color to boycott My Pillow .
He needs to be stopped freal
America I swearica, you have truly fallen. He's guilty of murder.
Ha!  Who's your media source or sources for reporting 'accuracy'?
Kyle is screwed realistically. If the Evidence is confirmed, throwing a bag of medical release papers doesn't constitute putting 3 bullets in someone. Which in turn destroys his defense in all altercations after. Sad part is political affiliation seems to dictate peoples bias perception of this case.
Both Ricky and his pillow pal are irrelevant to humanity.
I wish they would have given this money to the families of the dead rather than this piece of wasted flesh.
So...am I the only person who thinks the My Pillow guy hugs more than just pillows? Like this isn't the 1st time he bailed a young man out of jail. My Pillow guy looks he use to hang with Jared from Subway a lot!! Creepy AF vibe
The top comment (deleted by the Today show) was:   Kyle Rittenhouse...putting people to sleep. By My Pillow.
Obtaining a firearm illegally hampers his case, deception ! Anyone can get off with a good lawyer. OJ, Casey Anthony, trump, just to name a few.
Looks like I’m in the market for a “my pillow” now.
If I wrote everything I thought about this, il b here all day🤔😔sad.
Not Guilty!
So this is what the end of the road looks like. SAD LITTLE BOY, VERY SAD.
Apparently he had the bail money under his pillow.
Why walk around with assault rifle? He had intentions to harm ppl who or how many is the real question
He may get away with it because he has the complexion for the protection
How come the mom didn't get charged for bringing her kid to a different state to shoot people?
Stuff like this makes me want to move to Costa Rica.
I guess the my pillow guy supports domestic terrorism.
You must be kidding me...a young man goes out with the intention of killing people, does it, gets apprehended and now these two get him out of jail! 2020 is getting worse than ever. Shame on Pillow Guy and Ricky Schroeder for what you have done...you condone murder. I do not agree with senseless violence. This is beyond what America stands for. Shame on you both.
Let's goooooo
My pillow guy used to be a crack head.
😳😳🤦😏
Who cares. You have an asteroid the size of the moon headed directly towards the Earth. Guess God wins after all. 😇
All these pillow jokes are laughing me to sleep hahaha XD
Must be nice to be white, and a tool of politics.
That reminds me. I need to buy a My Pillow.
Cool, now I'm gonna smell boot leather every time I lay down on the MyPillow I have.
this guy had a gun purchased for him then drove to a protest in another state knowing that he will  get provoked to use it . this is pre-meditated murder, not self defense. the prosecutor is going to eat him alive in court.
I’m so happy to hear that. He did a good job for getting rid of those rioting scum. I hope he helps eliminate Antifa
Kyle is going to be very rich one day. The charges are fake and will be eventually dropped or thrown out by a judge.
This, does put a smile on my face.
Finally a True America Hero has been freed thank you God
Rittenhouse is no angel.  He hit a girl violently weeks before this incident.  He's an violent juvenile.
Sick a shooter back on the street I love are justice system
Watch the video(s). Kyle was getting chased by a mob of people who were trying to hurt him. This is a clear case of self defense. Watch the videoS
You are amazing KYLE💜 Stay FREE!!
fat lil boy aint maga only alphas bro!
Fukn stupid well both their careers are over..
Give him a metal not a murder charge he killed commies not humans
People are being evicted and food insure. Money better spent. I won't purchase his products!
$2 million in bail??  For self defense??   Nasty stuff.?
Yes the fact that he is a trump supporter was important information in this case 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Pillows for murderers and terrorists.
If the My Pillow guy doesn't put you to sleep, Kyle Rittenhouse will.
I’m sure they would not help him if he wasn’t white and did the same thing. Kid was pointing and illegal gun at people and got into an altercation at a protest and shot three people supposedly over being grabbed or pushed and over property that wasn’t even his. Maybe if he went to school and understood the grievances of black people, he would be aware of the look that a white teenager policing said black people in a protest makes.. the self defense argument is questionable.. the motive was probably for him to find something to defend to satisfy the desire to use his weapon. Teen was reckless and should do the time. How come police did not check his gun license??
This kid used self defense too save his life after tryna help the city from BLM TERRORISTS & ANTIFA TERRORISTS!!!     💯👍
Aww.... everyone's feeling getting hurt.
Stop buying those pillows please! That kid obviously was full of hate!
I love iit...i want european americans to think they can stomp around with no cares...2020 has shown change is right around the corner.the roles ware reversing...point to things like this when they start asking why and protesting when the shoe is on the other foot...lol
He was acting in self defense. We seen it. They pulled a gun on him... Why is this still happening. Has he gotnhis medal yet?
Really, he might as well have been a cop, bc he has that same i-wannabe-a-hero complex.  Guess now he knows playing rambo in real life sucks.
Sweet, those John wick movies really saved his life and the gun sling
Dang, it really does come in handy to fit the profile of what child predators are looking for, the one and only time it will ever help...
IF THIS GUY THINKS ITS ALRIGHT FOR ANYBODY TO TAKE A GUN AND GO LOOKING FOR TROUBLE AND THEN SHOOTS PEOPLE WHEN HE CAUSES THAT TROUBLE, THEN HIS COMPANY AND HE HIMSELF  NEEDS TO BE BOYCOTTED. SHOW THE WORLD THESE THIS KIND OF ACTIONS AREN'T ACCEPTABLE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
Great news!
That’s right
Can you just imagine if Kyle Rittenhouse is a Black or Hispanic teen? You would think he would get this kind of "special treatment"???
Can’t wait to see the case get thrown out the first day in court. The videos prove everything. Between him and the McClosky’s, it’s really telling how powerful crooked AG’s are.
It blows my mind how stupid people are. He’s not out of jail forever, he didn’t get away with anything. He posted bail. But people see he got out on bail and think all charges were dropped. Those are the same idiots that can vote. What a scary time to be alive
He is still going jail....
They should have said riots not protests.
Look at how proud they are of being murderers... this is what they’ve always been. Putting it on display for the entire world to see. Typical.
Last time I watch a movie with Ricky Schroeder in it.  Supports murderers
Guys chill out, that's just our legal system in a nutshell. He still has a court date and will be prosecuted all the same. Quick bet, trump supporters are going to surround his house and make Kyle miss his court date. If that happens I'm going to LMAO.
Enjoy your Freedom Kyle ... Patriots don’t belong in jail.
Lesson: "Dont attack a man with a riffle."
Ricky Schroder’s in my shithouse now.
MSM too funny.. My Pillow guy who supports the President.. Enjoy your holidays Kyle!
I live for the comments😂
U mean riots. Not protesting
🐑Somebody kept going back to the forbbiden knowledge 🍎🌳to azzezel🍎 of weapons. This is there mechanism of rebellion hoist it up into the dragon den. The animals are hunted down with them same weapons, the possums better off playing dead in those neck of the woods.
He was underage, illegal gun possession in another state and not trained properly with semi-automatic rifle.
So this proves that trump and his followers are fine with killing innocent people, I hope the coke head pillow man goes broke
My Pillow just went out the window! What a Dumb Crackhead decision!!! His company will not last after this!!
Entitled Losers.
What true american
wtf this guy killed people!
Every grandma out there should be whoopin on their grand kids that went out to riot and loot. If you have the smallest feeling one of your kids was out there acting up, whoop em nana. If they still don’t get it send Papa in.
SICK
As much press as Ricky Shroder and My Pillow will get in two lifetimes. Welcome to Bizzaro World.
Racists in no disguise
Now in return the my pillow guy is going to make him bite the pillow
Acting in self defense that wouldn’t have happened if his stupidity wasn’t there in the first place, he act like a terrorist applying fear in a msg of peace. Brandishing a semi-automatic weapon without the care of others pressuring fear and terror. This self defense is white wash privilege card.
America is turning sour. Treating a dumb 17yo like a hero when he should be behind bars. This is all Trumps doing
Thanks HOUSE!! You give a f***. Sometimes people don’t get it. Most of us do or eventually will.
I hope he get's life in prison. He murdered 2 people and would do it again if given the chance. Lock him up!
He will be found not guilty.
Won't ever buy a pillow from that guy anymore
Salute to the Kenosha kid🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 🧂🇺🇸🧂🇺🇸🧂🇺🇸🧂🇺🇸🧂🇺🇸🧂
Smh
My Pillow... Rocky Schroeder... (I haven't had my coffee yet) $2,000,000
He didn’t do anything Wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️
That pillow might be soft.but the bed will be hard.
Boycott my pilloe
I am but you should not have the gun because it was you’re a kid sorry you should be in jail forever
White privilege !!! At its best !!!!!
Lol....just 4 a GN sleep✔
IDENTIFYING ONE AS TRUMP SUPPORTER IS IGNORANT, WITH ALL THE HATE & CONTENTION OUR NATION IS FACING. SHAME SHAME
This the guy who was punching a girl from behind right?
My respect for the my pillow guy 📈📈📈
Kyle Rittenhouse = HERO Michael Lindell = HERO Ricky Schroder = HERO
Good for him.
Me!!!
Abolish cash bail.
Was Brian Williams there???  -Asking for "a friend."
This kid is a criminal and Jacob Blake is a hero..... but no Marxism happening here folks
Biden's days are number.... he's not the elect nor will he ever be period
Why when is a black 17 year old he is a man but when it's a white 17 year old he is a teen🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
We all know he was acting in self defense.  Trump needs to pardon him now!!!!  He is a political prisoner.
No more my pillow for us
What black man can do that and get that support?
It was self defense, we cant let these people have there way.. we need true justice not corrupt
video of incident clearly shows he was acting in self defense.  good for him.  everyone who has harshly judged him will deal with similar circumstances soon enough.
Self defence is now a crime in commie america and murder by certain groups is applauded by the news media
Thstd awesome news
Kid should have never gone to jail in the first place.
Anyone else find it funny that first this kid gets out on bail and then there is a major shooting in Milwaukee, WI 🤔
He had 2 guns to his head by BLM.  Went there to help with his medic skills from Illinois. Biden campaign being sued for character defamation labeling the kid white supremacist
P.s. there's no law against this ?
👏👏👏👏👏👏
He's walking down the street with a firearm and he's claiming self-defense. America really has lost its mind
That's what's up. Glad they had his back! 😊👍
Gross. We all hope he gets life in prison and perhaps the death penalty. He killed 2 innocent people.
Cool..now I hope he sues all the fake news for defamation of character. And lying.
He got out because he’s white !!!!
bailed out by my pillow...must be part of a sleeper cell
Tooth fairy came late but dang did it pay off. Odd tho bc it was the teeth of 2 dead people that got him paid... ouch......
Absolutely astonishing that underage killer took two lives with a firearm that he legally was not authorized to have at 17 years of age. Again please let it set in that a 17 year old living in a totally different state travels across state lines with again an illegal obtained RIFLE and kills TWO PEOPLE and so call business leaders put up bail money to get him out of jail and people say their is no such thing as White privilege. I personally hope that those businesses end up in bankruptcy court and ultimately out of business all together. The 17 year old violated a known curfew, carrying an illegal firearm, crossed state lines and again KILLED TWO AMERICAN CITIZENS but yet he gets unlimited financial support and gets out of jail. Sad and horrible legal system.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SX8F9fnx7A Get ready for a meltdown Lefties. L Lin Wood and Sidney Powell are extremely prominent lawyers who have an excellent track record. They are saying Trumps allegations are REAL. and more. In the video provided L Lin wood says "People are going to be shocked at the level of pedophilia. They are gonna be shocked at what I believe will be a revelation in terms of people who actually engage in Satanic worship." they would not just say this, they would be throwing their entire lifes work down the drain if these allegations they are making are not true. And you know whats funny? is even if it came out to be true, all of it, alot of people on the left would still trust the democratic party. the brainwashing is deep.
2 million bail??oh yeah he is innocent😂😂😂
So wrong😥 Meanwhile they keep ppl on 500$ bail for  a gram or just being black, hispanic, black, hispanic , black , hispanic and black hispanic
Even the pillow dude is RACIST wtf is wrong with this world now we have to boycott the pillows smh
Kyle is innocent.  Self Defense
Investigators said videos they reviewed showed that Rosenbaum, who appeared to be unarmed, chased Rittenhouse as he ran across a parking lot and threw something at him.  "The object does not hit [Rittenhouse] and a second video shows, based on where the object landed, that it was a plastic bag," the complaint said,   Only in amerikka....
Me
Kyle shouldnt have been in jail in the first place
🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸THE KENOSHA KID IS FREE🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸👏🏻🇺🇸
Now Kyle can rest his head comfortably
That's crazy! I can't believe either of these men care about or realize what they did by helping this murderer!
I thought the Democrats supported no cash bail? If the Democrats didn’t have double standards then they’d have no standards at all.
My pillow guy is friends with the mango Mussolini..so where do you think some of that bail money came from??
It's Rick Schroeder, not Ricky!!
Time to boycott Mr. Pillow!!!
My guess is that Trump is the real source for this.
God bless him. He is a victim of thugs and the fascist power hungry democrat politicians.
Great news!! An American hero.
First degree murder! Dont sugar coat it
Good he didn't do anything wrong.
I heard the bailee agreed to wear homemade , blue polyester shirts from hence-forward with the 'My SilverSpoon Pillow' emblazoned on it in a target-shaped pattern on the back ... built-in bandeleros in it to hold more 'mags' of ammo.  It's sure to be the alt-right fashion trend this coming Spring...
No such thing as self defense when your the aggressor... he came out with a weapon wanting to harm protester an hunting them.
#kyledidnothingwrong
2 milyon dolar nice cash
And just think nobody or her family or any super star's could post a $ 500.00 dollar bail for a traffic violation for Sandra Bland but he can get  a $ 2 million. BUT TO be fair we didn't know who she was till after she killed herself in jail and then everybody wanted to help.
Tell me if he were a black conservative "protecting the land" would he receive the same treatment? No he would be labled crazy Antifa like the rest of them.
Time for a lead donation to this F-stick.
Praise God..... First of all he should NEVER have been in JAIL....
Thank goodness for some justice. Love how the MSM/liberals paint him as a killer when it was self defense because of those rioting, VIOLENT thugs
Good he shouldn't have been charged but being found guilty is another story no one who assaulted him has been arrested
Mugging for the camera after killing two Americans in “self defense”and traveling from out of state to do it? What’s happening to my country?
Finally, some good news.
Are you morons must mean watching a different video that I watched I watched him being chased down the street I watched him get hit with a skateboard and watched him fall down and when that moron grabbed his gun he shot him I would’ve done the same thing
I cant 2020 is blowing my mind
His mom drove him to the riot, and this guy bails him out. Seems like Kyle is just a vehicle for the will of fully grown adults.
Thank you so much to the people who helped.  God bless you and your family   👪
Babylon is burning.
Good luck convicting him.
I hope they are easy on him. Seems like an good kid who put himself in a stupid situation. Don’t think he’s a danger to society and if anything probably has a whole different outlook on violence and how fast the SHTF. An unnecessary situation for the whole community involved
People who commit murder don't get bail haha!!! Kyle we knew you were innocent the whole time buddy 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 America strong!!! 2A Strong!!!
I gonna order two of those pillows Today!!!    Great news!! Thanks for helping this kid, we need more like him in this country.  Oorah👊🏻
Shame on you Rick Schroeder.
Shameful!
Killers must be locked
Ran from scene. Didn't rendered care as  he was acting to do so earlier in the night. Didn't call 911. Shot 2 other people. Under 18 and with assault rifle from another state. Wasn't hired as security for businesses. Not allowed to have a gun period. How can defend that when he was in the wrong since he left his state.
Kyle is DISCUSTING
Hope he walks, completely innocent
The new George zimmerman everyone. A wannabe tough guy nutjob with a gun fetish who went looking for a reason to shoot people in the streets. Now being backed by the far right as some sort of hero. This kid will never understand the gravity of his actions.
You should show the video of Joe Biden admitting to being apart of the most extensive election fraud organization ever!!!!! Crooked lying media brainwashing lies into peoples head there is more evidence by the day https://youtu.be/QL0_1qVg3-w
One way or another, Kyle Rittenhouse will pay the price for killing two innocent people.   He belongs in prison for the rest of his life (that is the best place for him and will provide him with the highest chance of survival).  However, should the political winds blow his way and he be set free... I believe he will lose his mind because the media, victims, and their supporters, will make sure he fully comprehends his actions ended two innocent lives... who would be alive today had he not been an irresponsible, over confident, and woefully ignorant teenager.  The constant reminders and the weight of the guilt will be more than enough to drive that young man mad.  I believe the next person he shoots will be himself.  There are no winners in this situation. The only variable is the amount  of loss.   Mr pillow guy should have left him where he was.
Someone is obviously making too much money selling pillows.
Hero
https://youtu.be/T-lZJ6b31BM Sidney Powell  https://youtu.be/za34H-dT8I0 North Korea
He was check the vid
Welcome to America ladies and gentlemen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Give it a week before he's dead too
Self defense... Kyle FTW
At least he will have a place to lay his head in big-boy prison.
Enjoy your Days out boy. Will be back soon
Good. No question he acted in self defense. Nice to see some companies not afraid of cancel culture. Black rifle coffee and my pillow pillows for me. Might just pop on an episode of silver spoons!
🥰😍😍😍😍😍
Wooooooooooow  joylavita.com
So chasing someone with a gun you’re are NOT supposed to have is self defence? Got it
Id like to see all the people complaining about him being a murder put themselves in his shoes. Would they not shoot a person with a gun pointed at them? Would they not shoot a person sprinting after them when gunshots were just fired behind them?
Rittenhouse came to Wisconsin to protect and represent!!
USA has fallen so far, more people need to watch less TV and reconnect with reality.
Sorry I ever supported the my pillow company. Never again and I’m spreading the word!
Why does this video have so many dislikes?
Kyle for potus
My pillow guy & little silver spoon.
The pillow guy is financing terrorist in America it's time to go to our best weapon a lawyer time to file lawsuits👍.
Sickening
A true American hero 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Comment section is cool rn...let’s keep this goin. Pillow !
He deserves his freedom!!! Watch ALL the footage!!
I mean, it was self defense tho...just a bit excessive...
I got one of those pillows Its a nice pillow
This is bs!!! He was not suppose to be out there with no gun, you at 17 should be home doing otherwise, you walk with a gun which means you're looking trouble, he brought the attention to himself, i would of run after him too, to get the gun away from him, nobody knew his intentions, and these sorry people backing him up. He is not the law!!
Thank the lord thank every body that helped this young man God bless stay safe
Money matters lives dont we get it ! Next
kyle is going to walk free from homicide charges. clearly it was self defence. as for any legal issues in regards to his possession of the rifle i would assume he will get a moderate punishment....but hopefully he gets a big stack of cash when this is al over. kids a hero and leftism is a mental illness that effects societies weirdos and degenerates.
Backing killers
Imagine spending millions of dollars bailing out a kid murderer that you don't even know lol
Guys theres only maybe 5 good pillow jokes that can he made about this. U can stop now
I cant be mad at him if the people he killed were obitual offenders looking for trouble evil has no race or color it just looks like someone put there fingers a little to close to the fan
80s child stars will do anything to be relevant.
Have fun in jail kid
I understand that Kyle purchase the rifle illegally and that he probably shouldn't have been there, but the reality is that a situation like that is exactly what the 2nd amendment was meant for. Had something like this happened in the time when the constitution was written the men of the town, being every able-bodied male from 16-70, would have been expected to stand up and protect their town with their constitutionally protected firearms. Even further these mindless violent mobs have even shown the importance of standard capacity magazines.
People need to look at the unedited footage of the entire incident and make up their own minds. The msm doesn’t hold back from being biased and shaping the narrative to fit their agenda/politics.    Kid defended himself from violent extremists and had better discipline/weapons handling than lots of others out there. The guys that attacked him, played a stupid game and won a stupid prize for their efforts.  Video footage of the entire incident shows that he was not the aggressor and that people had been shooting towards him prior to him using deadly force.
Wtf!
Good! He never should’ve went to jail.
He should have the death penalty... disgusting
RICKY SCHRODER    lol
Poor little feller. Gonna spend a good deal of his life in prison. But, take lives, this happens. Should had stayed home and watched ol reruns of the facts of life
He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth and he didn't have a soft pillow but now he has both only in america 🤣
America is such a disgusting place. Shame on you!
Weren’t the protesters Rittenhouse shot unarmed?
*Gaige Grosskreutz needs to be in jail for attempted murder.* Grosskreutz is caught ON VIDEO talking to Rittenhouse who says, "I'm getting the police". Rittenhouse was RUNNING AWAY from the "peaceful protesters" with his gun pointed down. This is literally open and shut case of attempted murder. WHY IS HE FREE?
Dead boys don't get gun sponsorships.
The teen-age shooter Kyle Rittenhouse is now a free man. He's free to respond to the next protest with his weapons to possibly do more harm. They are true believers.Look at those smiles. They''re Christian and completely convinced that their cause is righteous. More will follow their example unless checked by the courts and a President that calls out Vigilantism.
White privilege personified.
Thanks my pillow 🙏👍🇺🇸 Kamala beil out many and not comments or pictures
This kid is going to be the coolest kid if he gets out of trouble.
He was acting in self defence!
Disgusting country
The three people that Rittenhouse shot happens to be criminals. These protesting seems to draw them out.
He's guilty of murder.
I am going to buy 20 more My Pillows right away!
Prayers out to the families of the two people lost ❤️ Even of it was in self defense (I personally dont know the situation) It would be crazy to wake up every morning and go to bed at night knowing you have taken the lives of two people. Young boy needs Jesus in his life either way ❤️
If Kyle was a lib, he wouldn't have been in jail.
Law and order... I love to go with my ak47 into the streets and then claim I could have been killed: It's almost as if he was forced to go into the streets self defensing himself with a riffle gun against bare knuckles guys, I know crazy right.
Disgusting country where you could bail out a terrorist with money.
I'm going to go buy these pillows and watch old episodes of silver spoons.
Pathetic but he can’t bail out of sentencing
Weed is still safer than alcahol if u ask me  🐯
Give this man a metal for getting rid of a chow mo.
Yeah, let's live in a country where we all open carry and get to shoot each other for stupid reasons.
i wish kyle could get a life sentence with no chance at getting out
He did nothing wrong. It was self defense
These video feels like an oust on the Pillow guy and Rick more than info on Kyle.
G U I L T Y ! ! !
everyone who bought a my pillow contributed to this
He is so lucky he didn't do this before 1853, he would have got the death penalty. As it is he will just get life without parole. To all those claiming he murdered two people in self defense, it is not self-defence if you are protecting property, especially if you are in no way connected to that property. If you believe your life was in danger it is slightly different but double homicide is double homicide, it is what it is.
Rittenhouse 2052 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Such a punchable face
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Kyle Rittenhouse is an American hero!
I'm here 4 the comments
Fake news NBC...
Do your own research and stop listening to the media. They have video of Kyle running from the men who attempted to assault him after he extinguished a flaming dumpster they were trying to push into a gas station.  He acted in self defense, people who were there at the scene already went on the record declaring so, the only laws he broke was possession of a firearm under the age.  Media does everything in their power to SHAPE THE NARRATIVE in the direction they want to make you think the way they want you to feel. It is the same tactic they used in Germany to make people hate the Jewish community, and yet people can't see this.
NBC Kilo Mike Alpha
He’s a murderer!! He will pay when he is in prison. He better hope that the my pillow guy pays the AB for his protection in prison! 💩💩
DEMONS!
I hope someone puts a pillow over all of their faces and snuffs the life out of them.
Ugh... Just ugh
Why you gotta trump
IM BUYING A MY PILLOW
Awesome news. Clearly shows it was self defense
I just wanna' point out that if you attack someone carrying a gun and get shot because of it; it is your fault. -Brought to you by My Pillow. Softer than a dirt nap
Amen. Beautiful, posterchild of a true American right there. He reminds me of the physical version of the intellectual factual true American Denzel Washington.  I feel even better spending 167 bucks on my pellow order a week ago.
NICE!!!
LETS GO KYLE!
Hero
Wait so where is the trial for the people who murdered two poc kids in Seattles CHAZ??
So if you had a gang jump you and beating the crap out of you, would you call fighting back assault? No, a gun is just a tool used to equalize the threat or pose a greater threat to people targeting you.
I wonder if Zimmerman would have been a hero if he did it post Trump life 🤔
Video is out there, it was clearly self-defense.   Rioting thugs knocked him to the ground and tried to mob him.
BLM does it.  Why not pillow spoons
Wowwwwww!!!! Smh
The fact that the My Pillow guy is a Trump supporter is of no relevance to this story whatsoever, but of course the media has to tie in Trump to whatever they can.
Better go to Mexico while you still can
Lock him up for #MURDER.  Nothing but an #ASSASSIN. #KyleRittenhouse
This is amazing I'm so happy he's out. Its nice to see celebrities do something with there money besides on themselves
This man is an American hero! He should be hailed as a patriot. He did nothing wrong. I’ll contribute to any go fund me etc for this guy and I’m so glad he made finally bail.
Stupid kid has no idea what's going on, and never did.
For the best night sleep in the whole wide world. Not.
It’s scary that 8,000 people are upset a child molester got killed while chasing after a minor. Though it makes sense when you realize they voted for a child molester to be president
$2 mil. the cost of a human life apparently.
Guess what all my democrat relatives are getting for christmas this year?
He's dead Man walking when he's in jail pillow man needs to be boycotted from all store's
You're still going to prison for a long time kid.
Kyle is underaged kid carrying illegal weapon and put himself in danger.  Put himself in danger and carrying illegal assault rifle doesn't make it self defense.  Just ask his buddy who bought the rifle for him now in trouble with the law for transferring illegal weapons to minor.  He was asking for a trouble and the law should make an example of his case so this doesn't happen again.  His parents should be also charged putting their son in danger.  This case shouldn't be about riot or white or black thing.
Thank God.
Crossing My Pillow off my christmas list. Yeehaw!
Kyle Rittenhouse is an American hero!
Glad he’s out! Shouldn’t have been charged!
He did nothing wrong .
2 million dollars bail is absurd... he isn't at risk of running. The kid turned himself in for goodness' sake.
it was legit self defence. go watch donut operator's vid on the whole incident
Glad to see it. Hope he wins the court case ahead of him.
Kyle is a hero. Trump needs to pardon him.
Dude deserves to be put away for what he did to these families. If he had not had the gun in the first place, this never would have happened.
newest spokesboy for my pillow,
Why bail someone out who's just going to go back to jail anyway. I saw the videos and no 17 year old kid someone who can't even legally vote yet shouldn't be walking around weilding an assault rifle. And you don't keep firing at random while getting up in self defense after everyone is already off of you.  People get shot, people die, all over a dumb misunderstanding. If you're not old enough to vote or drink a beer, you shouldn't be able to walk the streets with assault rifles or any kind of rifle or gun unless you're a trained soldier or police officer.
No shock here, Ricky has been arrested for domestic violence multiple times, so of course he bails out a murderer.
So many dumbasses here. Bailed out doesnt mean freedom. It just means ur out in public and can go on with ur day until judgement day arrives. In which case he will most likely go to prison. At least he will get free supply of fresh my pillow
Acting in self defense "of what"? Didn't he go to the protest with a rifle?
Hero
Only the special edition Kyle Rittenhouse my pillow can make you feel like you can sleep for eternity (commies not included)   Order your my pillow today!
They bailed him out before he was able to be questioned
he's going to get boned when he goes to prison
He did nothing wrong.
Thank God he is home!
Jokes aside, if you take pictures with this murderer, you get a signed pillow.   I know people still in jail for possession but I guess it’s fair. They have pillows
So, about this bite my pillow guy, why is he so interested in this young thug?
He was acting in self defense it's not a claim it's a fact or something similar to a fact 🤣🤣
This might be the only comment section I've ever seen that has reasonable, polite debate going on about a sensitive and complex issue like this
When he sleeps at night...best to make good use of that Pillow...and put him to rest...⚰😏...
media mad.  notice they screw with a child who defended himself from an armed left wing mob, but a guy who shoots a lone unarmed Trump supporter, low bail, no problem.  Anybody paying attention yet?
AWESOME! I'm getting myself a My Pillow guy pillow now because of this. Thanks for letting me know!
Lol
So “my pillow” supports homicide. Whew! Baby. FOX n My Pillow has gone nuts!
Anyone with two eyes can see and read he was acting in self-defense
He probably put his pillows up as collateral
That kids gonna need secret service or protection from the police😳besides what he's known for now some know him to be a woman beater too
Good for him a real American hero
If a black kid illegally brandished a firearm in the streets and killed 2 people, like this white kid, he would be dead, not bailed out by rich people. SMH
Cool. Bail was overcharged.
bet dude will be....sleeping easy tonight.......or your money back
That was pre meditated murder. Call it what it is. A tree is a tree.
Shouldn’t have ever been imprisoned in the first place
Covid-19 better get him!!!
BAIL.....THIS DUDE WAS OFFERED BAIL!!!!!!WTF!!!! IF HE WAS BLACK OR HISPANIC HE WOULD BE DEAD!!!!!! AND YOU WONDER WHY THEY STARTED BLACK LIVES MATTER
Well wait till he's charged with 1st degree homicide.. Maybe then you could get him a my pillow for when he's getting drilled by bubba in the clink!
Thank God for these angels who came to this kids rescue. ALL for him just trying to help - CONTRARY to the lies that the media reported. This story got buried once there was more than a few other videos which surfaced to prove his innocence. WWG1WGA 🇺🇸🙏✝️❤️✌️
So glad Rittenhouse looks well. The cops must have looked out for him because he did what they're not allowed to do because they got their hands tied behind their backs
He should be free. Self denfense against thugs.
After seeing this Time to buy new pillows fellas
Disgusting!
Great News!!
I hope he jumps bail to live free of his own will.
Good, Kyle Rittenhouse defended himself.
An American hero
MY BOIS BEEN FREED
Wonder if they’ll let him use his autographed My Pillow in prison
Eff that woman beating murderer
People are happy for someone who killed 2 people and crossed state lines, but not anywhere concerned about the police officers who randomly just use excessive force on innocent black people.
I mean, I can expect a good amount of support from my pillow.. but to be bailed out completely.. I need a better pillow.
Thanks so much for posting this. I have wondered what happened to this young man. Praying for u! Hoping all good.
Rick you know where you can put your silver spoon.
He'll be stuffing pillows for the rest of his life paying off that $2 million. I would of just took the jail time.
At least one good thing came out of 2020
wow. do we need any further proof of class war?
Mike lindell is the devil. Rick schroeder is a talentless has been. Kyle is a murderer. The three thug stooges.
Good let him be free, he defended himself.
Is it me or is this some form of white privilege? What a joke.... But what would I know, im white.
Time to fart on all those pillows
You are kidding me, right?
He is a killer that is now out on bail. WTF?? It’s always about the money!! Money talks & bs walks. I don’t care what his defense is he is still  murdered 2 people & for that there should have never been a bond set.
FREE KYLE
Good job 👍 you helped to get a killer out of jail ricky you were a joke actor now you help killers  wow  how do you think the families of the people he killed feel I'am sure they are very proud of you what a loser you are
I’m buying more pillows.   Kyle is an American Hero!
disgusting, they all should be rotting in prison right now
Incite a Riot or Enjoy the Quiet. MyPillow Supports you 😉
Self defense with an assault rifle. Fukn crazy & plenty of has been actors condoning it. Mike lindell shame on u
Kyle The Pillow Saint
I guess he is hiding his bail money under the mattress...or was it his pillow??🤔
White privilege
I'm super happy. I'm just wondering if they would have done the same thing for a (for example) patriotic Hispanic.
I see nothing wrong. He was defending himself from protesters because they were attacking him, he has a right to protect himself. Truth hurts but Kyle is not the problem.
The pillow guy and Ricky need to be locked 🔒 up 🤔
Lmao, people that still argue that capitalism is the best we can do are flat out idiotic
This boy took it upon himself to get in his car and drive hundreds of miles to put himself in the middle of the chaos with intent to do harm...he went further and murdered 2 innocent protestors...this young man deserves jail time! That's why BLM is so very important because these white racist supremacists stick together. POWER TO BLACK LIVES MATTER
Not murder
When you're in prison and Libs are saying bite the pillow and the pillow maker bonds you out
Imagine protecting a burning  dumpster. And killing people.... While getting out on bond.
Free Tay K
This is why people in this country are sociopaths bc they’re not held accountable when they fit a privileged profile. This world is on its last leg.
Good should have never been arrested in the first place.
LOL at calling him a terrorist
Wonder if they make pillows for coffins 😂😂😂😂😂
good deal. kyle was a hero and a trashman doin his job
Set him free
Congratulations, he did the time did the bail this is our USA 🇺🇸 law service what more do you wanna talk about, and also the my pillow save my father‘s life when he had heart surgery, and I sleep at my mini one for my neck and insomnia problems! I love the my pillow guy he’s pretty funny🤣😂😅🙌🏻🤘🏻✌🏻
HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE. HELLO?? trump has got y'all in a brain fog...
Ya know I when I was in high school I yelled at Ricky and told him that He Sucked!. it was in the parking lot of the Nassau Coliseum after a Islander game. 1990 91 maybe.  I take it back. Ricky Baby you fkn rule! God BLESS America TRUMP 2020
You let a woman beater and a killer out of jail. Only in America
At least he'll be comfy in his cell.
He is a political prisoner. If he's convicted will he be the first detainee at the Democrat's "reeducation camps" where the guards wear a symbol on their arms that used to represent life, sun, power, strength, and good luck? He should never have been locked up. A travesty.
K.R. was just out playing Call of Duty that night with his friends. Then things just got a little to real. His " medic kit ". I bet he carried it just in case he got hurt.
He was acting in self defense. There is even video evidence of a awarm of rioters attacking him
I will make sure I never buy a pillow from his company or it's affiliates ever!
When he’s in prison at least he’ll have a My Pillow to cry on
Kyle, little buddy..You a Hero to Americans....Never forget that......You have a following of great Patriots that Approve of how you handled your situation......God Bless you and your family..!!
The way they are posing and smiling like he's some hero, it's disgusting. It's pathetic, sad and embarrassing to humanity how many people think on any level what he did was okay or excusable...
It was self defense. You come at a kid holding a gun, what do you think is going to happen?
Should of never been charged noway
:)
At a protest not in his home state, with a gun he didnt own, killed two other Americans. Supported by a Pillowguy and some washed up actor no one remembers or wants to. I really want to just forget about 2020.
So they threw out the my pillow guy so he would lose business, and per the video it did look like self defense. That'll be up to jury to decide! 😐😑😐
Thats the whole video seriously.
That makes me happy! Way to go Mike an Ricky, you guys are true American Patriots, thank you. Kyle is innocent!😀
Ricky Schroder Silver Spoons guy a non stop partier can't control what's going on in his own life " He needs to get a grip on reality .
That guy belong in jail. He killed two people and it wasn’t self defense...that we saw on TV.
Murdering little boy needs to pay for killing human beings who were practicing their RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH without holding any weapons. This guy has to go to jail!
Home for Thanksgiving! Happy Thanksgiving, patriot!
He's PALE and got a pass, so he can do it AGAIN. Proof of JUSTUS .
I feel sorry for the DA , his family and everyone involved if he is convicted. Someone is going to complain.
Boooya!!!
"Claims"? Bro, did you see the video?
Boycott My Pillow and little rick schroder.
He had his hand between two pillows.
God Bless St. Rittenhouse #murica
He should've stayed in jail because I don't think he'll last long on the streets
That is disgusting from has been Ricky Schroeder and deplorable my pillow man for helping a killer.
He has a RIGHT to DEFEND HIMSELF!  It undeniable that he would have been killed!
FREE KYLE!
He's going to need all the pillows he can get.  His milkshake will be bringing all the boys to the yard 😄
During a prot3$t or a r!0t?
HE WAS ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE THATS WHY HE HAS THE BACKING....WATCH ALL THE VIDEOS FROM ANY ANGLE....THE MEN WHO WERE KILLED HAD A GUN IN THEIR HAND WHILE TRYING TO TAKE HIS GUN AND THEY PAYED WITH THEIR LIFE....SLAM DUMK SELF DEFENSE CASE....NOT GUILTY
Nice! I'm definitely going to buy a mypillow now!
Kyle "fluffin pillows makin widows" Rittenhouse
america. guilty til proven innocent. the perp is the victim. the victim is a perp. smdh
Ever wonder  if My Pillow Guy is a lowkey  trolling  🧐🧐🧐😳😳😳 Rittenhouse might  as well get in good with  my pillow guy because if he catches a murder conviction he WILL be forced to become an unwilling participant in pillow market research for a LONG time.
This is what happened in this crooked society, especially when a so called movie actor and some rich men who idolize a murderer ... they are all delusional and they glorify a killer . What a sick- sick society 😡
Ill be ordering me a pillow, and some giza sheets tomorrow!
Trumper Lindell is a far right nut case...figures.
H E R O
Good. F*** ANTIFA.....Thanx to Mike Lindell and Ricky Schroeder and his lawyer Lin Wood for not caving to these socialist d-bag's rioting & burning down cities....
Wow, a video on Kyle that just gives the facts! Have I fallen into a different dimension? Is this... the twilight zone?   #freekyle
He can claim self defense all he wants he was still in possession and using a firearm under 18 years old
Silver spoons flock yadda yadda...
Arrest his parents
Self defense
He should be in Prison
B,S
It was self defense!!
Way to go Mike Lindell and Ricky Schroeder!  Finally someone has the balls and heart to stand up for what’s right.
Murderer! Hope he spends the rest of his life wishing he was in jail.
Stupid that he was ever put in jail. He smoked a few worthless degenerates that tried to mob on him, sore losers.
KYLE RITTENHOUSE IS INNOCENT. He killed hose antifa scum in self defense. Nothing of value was lost.
You mean the Kenosha riots where he defended himself.
Kyle u are a true American Patriot through and through !!!! U stood up to the far left and held your ground  !!!!! U I would hold my ground with !!!!! U are an inspiration to us all !!!! Thank u !!!!!
Whether or not you believe what he did was legal or not legal, how can these 3 smile about someone being dead?  Disgusting
Wisconsin law doesn’t permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless they’re hunting. He was 17, his friend purchased the firearm for him, and he went to the location of the shooting with the intention of "defending" a business with deadly force, that is literally a CLEAR, cut case of vigilantism. That is CRIMINAL in the united states. Anybody who refuses to tolerate those facts, doesn't realize that what they're fighting for is actually anarchy, not order.
Bail is such a stupid concept
Finally
I just decided to buy a "My Pillow"/
Outstanding news!!! Poor kid being treated like a savage. He killed 2 child rapists. While defending himself from angry violent fascist BLM mob that was terrorizing an entire city.  Kyle is a hero and will never see the inside of a cell again.
Where was this kind of financial support for Kalief who was accused of taking a backpack? But an armed shooter killing innocent protestors gets this kind of treatment? Where were those same donors? Quiet and racist and it’s gonna be extremely difficult to see that differently.
Take The Pillows and Whack The Liberals Heads with them!! Trump 2020!!
just saw the video and yea lets run at the kid with the ar one after the other instead of all at once, i thought that only happens in counter strike
mom's said its the cops fault
NEVER WILL I EVER BUY A MY PILLOW!!
These 3 are patriots. Plain and simple. Thanks Ricky!  You were great in pool hall junkies.
that makes things very easy. now where does he live? i would like to make sure he sleeps permanently. brought to you by MyPillow
A whole bunch of you are defending a kid that should have never had a firearm, let alone an illegally obtained one. You really think that you would be defending a person of color in a similar situation? Or would you be bashing on the people who did a straw man purchase and the kid. On top of everything, he put himself in that situation. He had full intentions of being in a violent conflict. Why else would you take and brandish firearms openly. I feel sorry that this young man is going away for a long time and that two people are dead. Messed up situation all around.
He should definitely be charged with unlawful possession of a firearm but he shot those people in self defense.
When you make your bed hard... and someone hands you soft pillows...
Schroeder and Pillow guy just skyrocketed in my rankings.
Good for him. When a mob or anarchists are attacking you and even the police are too afraid to help you, we all have a right to legally defend ourselves when attacked and threatened with death.  I pray he proves his case because I saw the videos and it was clearly self-defense.
Hero!!!!
John Wayne . HERO.
I hope he jumps and they all lose.
Very interesting.  I hope he continues to support the guy.
Looks like he got a lifetime supply of Black Rifle coffee.
Time to buy
He needs to go back. Prison time so big Dawg could handle him
I'm a born again christian...so why do I find this story disturbing...with these two celebrities smiling and yucking it up with an adolescent who just killed two people....
Before Trump won President how many Murderers did he Free. America is headed in the Wrong Direction. Wrong Precedent. That is Why we Pivot in a New Direction. Lawlessness Abound.
You should be in jail
this dude was in my grade back in middle school, always got bad vibes from him ngl
What a headline, 2020 gets better an better lol
He is a murder.
Good for him  i back him up 100
Mike you truly are one amazing man...! Rick, loved you on NYPD Blue and you are still an amazing man too...! Thank you so very much two both of you...! It is so refreshing to see that there are still good people out there who believe in the truth, our God given rights to be allowed to protect ourselves and  others in need from any evil that would do us or others harm...! Obviously, there are too many Traitors out there who have  forgotten that gift from God and believe that they are above  the law as it is written...! We have all seen the videos, we have witnessed the corruption  of those who would prosecute him falsely, we have witnessed  the spineless cowards who are more concerned with protecting  known felons who were in the very act of breaking our laws than upholding the rights of the victim...! Thank you again for your wisdom of the truth, your compassion for Kyle, your desire to see justice carried out, and being a true American...! God will bless both of you richly for doing his work and helping this young man before the Corrupt can ruin his life...! Thank you...!
I bet the kid jumps bail, so we are all on the hook to buy more pillows.  BTW they are worthless
He spent all that money on a kid that killed 2 people and wounded 1. He is not innocent. He took off running after shooting someone in the head killing him. The other people were trying to stop him. He fell on the ground. Then he panicked, shooting one guy in the hand an then other in the chest killing him.
Kyle likes normal pillows. ....not pillow biters
He should have been locked up without bail!!! So glad I didn’t make his pillow my pillow!!!
Self defense with an assault rifle makes sense to me.
Ricky Shroeder what are you gonna Do.
I feel disgusted sleeping on these pillows.. not my pillow anymore
Republicans: "Social programs just give money to lazy people and criminals" Also republicans: "Let's give a lot of money to this violent criminal"
Kyle showed us the way!👊✊
The video clearly shows it was self defense.  Unfortunately, due to politics and the court of public opinion he may be convicted regardless of the facts.
Wowwwww. Im throwing my "my pillow" straight in the trash. The court needs to revoke his bond and raise it to $20 million too. I hope he runs, and they lose their bond money.
Not one Black Person are in Any Commercials for the Pillow Guy
Theres a common trend out there at these 'peaceful protests':  They are filled with child molesters.
Catholics
Blame this on the Democratic officials that told their police to stand down while innocent people's businesses were burned down
Watch the video. He was acting in self defense.
If he was black he wouldn’t ever be allowed to post bail this is white privilege
Can he pay my rent please I’m short five hundred bucks
He was safer IN jail because there are legit hits out on him. Now we wait for the news where he is found dead someplace. Good job guys you signed his death warrant
Boycott The Pillow Guy
And I thought Avengers was the greatest crossover of all time
As a black American not mommy African lol I’m glad he’s out
Wouldn’t happen to a black man.
He is innocent!  How come the ones who attacked him have not been charged?
Disgusting.
That music is HORRIBLE
good, glad he is out, and glad people are so kind and caring.
One word.... Why?  Hmm? Does a pillow have anything to do with this?
Omg my pillow is Trumps buddy. That says a lot.
lol dude gunna have a rough time in prison, baby face over here acting all tough with a gun.. guys a coward plan and simple hopes he gets 25 alteast
Murder is cool. So is domestic terrorism.
SO HE'S NOT A TERRORIST?.......  Democracy is a joke, America is joke, CHRISTIANITY IS A BIGGER JOKE FILED WITH LIES.
FREE KYLE RITTENHOUSE
Sickening news...no one is happy to hear this. At least I know never to support the My pillow brand ever again. (The pillow jokes aren't funny -_- )
Bout time kid is a hero
this young man is a hero
Honestly i'm shocked this even went to trial with the mountain of video evidence showing the clearest case of self defense i've ever seen. This is purely political. They're taking months to figure out what the rest of us did in 10 minutes. Kyle's gonna walk, and he deserves to.
Why are a lot of Trump Supporters Violent? Who is the Instigator?
He did nothing wrong
Tears!
Now I'm sure he thinks what he did is right, now he can join the KKK, or the Proud boys. Ricky and pillow guy you're insane,  have they given you your hoods yet?
More separation more problems. United we stand divided we fall. I guess good for him🤷
That Paul Bearer look alike is gonna take a big nose dive in sales soon......i mean either way, does it matter when he already made his millions off a pillow?
Good for them getting him out.
Good for them he doesn’t deserve any time
He should’ve never been locked up to begin with
Always thought shroeder looked like a skinhead
False flag distraction
Baby Face Nelson posts bail by the MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, King Payer of false advertising lawsuits and Trump Loyalist.  Go figure. 😒
Lol basically said you are free to do it again
Big deal, this kid is still boned
I never thought Ricky Schroder to be a racist but I guess inbreeding causes these people to believe anything👉🎃
This kid is a hero and true American.
One and DON.    BYEDon 🤡💩
Revolting reality of the USA-- a white supremacist murderer, strutting in impunity. Aided with millions, by the filthy rich, with their filthy agendas.  This is the USA.
❤
*an actor standing with a shooter killer wearing a shooter killer t-shirt and i'm not supposed to think this was scripted, all of it?*
Ah yes my favorite person of the year he had to teach people you dont bring A skateboard to an AR15 fight lol but seriously this kid should of been out A long time ago.
love how these two blow a million to prove a point for one kid but could also feed many mouths for many days with that same money...gotta love the state of the world
I watched all the video of the WI events I could find.  Kyle was acting in self defense.
Suckers
For the best night sleep in the whole wide world visit my pillow .com
Couldn’t find a single Silver Spoons reference. You people make me sick
This seems like one of them Onion videos.
I want him found!   Streets:  Do your job!
Has anyone bought these My Pillows? Apparently they're filled with cash!
So. BLM protesters at a PEACEFUL protest can get shot at and arrested and everyone will call them horrible terrorists. But when a kid purposefully kills two people. He's all of a sudden a "hero" and deserves chances to live his life. What about the black, hispanic, muslim, even white women, men, and children who are purposefully killed by cops who think they can do whatever they want due to their job?
NOT "claim" blantantly obvious! - Young Hero!
You hear that, antifa?  The dude is loose.  Better start behavin'!
God Bless Kyle!
He was acting in self defense..This kid should be given a medal for killing these terrorist commie pigs..
Do you know the difference between Jacob Blake and Kyle Rittenhouse ? Kyle's gonna walk🤣🤣🤣
I hope is cellmate is a 300 pound black dude named Boom - Boom !!!! (out go the lights) proud boy
#StimulusNow
The people who were killed were losers and nobody will miss them. I hope Kyle is doing well. Hes been good this year 🎄
Upon hearing of Kyle's release all scheduled Antifa/BLM "Peaceful" riots were cancelled.
I’m so glad this young patriot is out of jail. Won’t be long now until he’s acquitted of these ridiculous charges. God bless These two men who posted bail for him..
Now lock up the corrupt prosecutor's and politicians of Kenosha
Self Defense can never be denied,The Right to Bear Arms can not be turned into a Crime.  “Where rights are secured by the constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.”  “The claim and exercise of a constitutional right cannot thus be converted into a crime”  “The supreme court of the United States is, however, the final expositor and arbiter of all disputed questions touching the scope and meaning of that sacred instrument [the US Constitution], and its decisions thereon are binding upon all courts, both state and federal.”
Unbelievable this kid MURDERER gets such support from the Fascist Right, disgusting!!!
I can't believe so many people thumbs-downed this.  I guarantee they're  either ignorant of what actually happened there or they're just brainless lefties who just dont want Americans being able to resist forceful takeover.
I don't know how I feel about this this gets a murderer no doubt in my mind no business being where he was with a loaded weapon while was he thinking
my pillow sales will drop after this goes worldwide
Good job guys.
we need more young men like Kyle Rittenhouse.
Its a weird time to be alive when the the guy running away and trying to not get killed by a mob is considered the bad guy.   Theres literally a video of the attack, how is this up for debate? Is this honestly just because hes a white kid?
This is good news. Thank you for bailing him out.
It is self defense period. I dont know how much proof people need. If it was a cop or some leader people would pardon it, but since hes nor a leftist the liberals are butt hurt.
The kid will justifiably go free. Phuck the democrats
My pillow brand pillows are junk, overpriced scam. They're targeting elderly people with their advertising you don't know a scam when they see it.

Kyle must have written a letter in jail to him about the quality of his prison pillow.
I wonder if it was a black 17 year old “man” walking around with an illegal gun, if he would garner this much sympathy. Maybe we need mandatory sentences for some crimes so the law can truly be colorblind.
Not little Ricky Schroeder 🤢🤮
Good
Kyle shot the attackers in self defense. All you have to do is look at the videos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iryQSpxSlrg&t=19s Watch this video many times, and this is 100% self defense. I keep seeing liberal news comment saying this was "peaceful protesting". Here's what I've summed up. 0:01 "Hit that dude!" and points at him. Guy in white shirt hit's him in the back of the head at 0:04 knocking his hat of obiously showing contact. Same guy then run at him again at 0:12 for another try. Then the next guy at 0:14 tries to jump kick him. Next guy at 0:14 a few milliseconds later hits him in the head with a skateboard and tries to pull his gun away from him. I initially didn't agree with the guy at 0:18 being shot when throwing his hands up, but you can clearly see him at 0:16 trying to attack him. Attacker 1 (Guy in white shirt): Runs away Attacker 2 (Skateboard guy): Shot Potential attacker 1 (Jump kick guy): Shot Potential attacker 2 (Rushing in to attach, but put hands up): Shot
It is Rick Schroder., Even his IMDB page list him as Rick going back to his Lonesome Dove days. Unlike a lot of child stars, Schroder's dad took care of his money invested his money in LA real estate and Schroder said he made more money off his dad's investments than he did acting.
Jacob Blake RIOTS, not protests.  Loser.
Screw you media...he's not a murder suspect.  He's a victim of a corrupt political system
Self Defense.
People went looking to cause trouble and complained when they found some?  Only because they were the losers.
SELF DEFENCE. Justice!!!!!!!!!
This is a little overdue
There is no claim., He was 100% acting in self defense.
Ttss what a waste of money 😐
I’m Getting My Pillow HaHa 😆
"Don't be a victim, it's time to fight back" - Frank Reynolds
And pour people in prison for petty crimes are still in prison
He's white, he killed a black person...therefore, he MUST BE A MURDERER.  yea, right.
Trump will give him a pardon so Biden cannot come after him with federal charges when he is acquitted by a state court.
Karma kyle
American citizens.  This is what happens when a citizen breaks the law and gain possession of a gun illegally. This is very simple America Citizens. Do not bring a gun to a protest if you're not a police officer or in law enforcement... If you feel like you need to bring a gun to a protest, then do not go to the protest. Otherwise, you can end up in prison for the rest of your life like Kyle will end up in prison for the rest of his life. Common sense goes a long way. This is way too simple and very avoidable.
lets goooooooo
White teen kills three white felons in self defense. Liberals: wHiTe sUpReMeCiSt!!!!!
These people are SICK!!! Freeing someone that killed a HUMAN BEING
Great work buddy! Let the bodies hit the floor!
Hey The Lefts Got A Taste 👅Of Victory ✌️ for Fidel Castro Biden and Che Guava Harris With Rigged Votes 🗳 , Well Let’s Return the Favor for Freeing  Kyle Rittenhouse From those innocent 😇 peaceful protesters who Sacrifice their lives By 🔥 Burning Down Cities.
God bless your Ricky S and Michael Lindell!!! That child in innocent. He deserves to be the poster child for "Justice for Americans"!!! Im praying for you Kyle!!
These comments are surprisingly calm and full of pillow jokes.
karma is coming his way.
Shouldn't have even been in jail. Thank you all who chipped in for his fund.
ANYONE WHO HAD SOMETHING BAD ABOUT THE KID OR YOU THINK HE'S GUILTY. WHAT WOULD YOU DO. I WILL TELL YOU YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN SO SCARED YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T REMEMBER..
Can you raise money for something that actually helps the country?!
Long overdue. Kyle Rittenhouse is an all-American hero and should be given a medal! (Or two, lmao)
Of course they got to bring trump into this for no reason.
The comment section will be better than the video...
Notice how mentioning the president in this news casting was so important that everyone needs to know the Donald Trump had absolutely what to do with him?
PU LINDELL.
He will probely will get no charges becuase DaBaby also killed someone for self defense and he got no charges on that
He should've never been arrested in first place!!
seriously the my pillow guy?
Enjoy your freedom now, Wisconsin is gonna give you life
Patriot
Why did you mention trump supporter. And clearly self defense lol
Enjoy the free time while it lasts!!!!!
Rittenhouse Not Guilty 2020
Bail should not have been set in the first place the video proves that
At least he’s ugly and Silver Spoons is a pos
Democrats have slaughtered over 60 million innocent little babies and then sell their body parts. How many of them are in jail or ever get charged with murder? How many of their fellow Democrats who call themselves Christians even care about those kids? I can tell you. None. I wonder if they think God's not aware of what they're voting for when they vote Democrat?
POTENTIAL MURDERER
Oh Lord please bless this world, 2 million dollars and these  billionaires somehow can't stop world hunger or bring peace to the world, all I remember dreaming about when I was younger was being rich enough to take care of the world and my family but it seems none of these billionaires had that dream

Can’t believe.  These actor . Helped a murder. Instead. Of a  homeless    They both criminals.
Check your 2020 bingo cards everybody
pretty chipper for a killer. enjoy those minor in possession and straw buyer charges
So, Ricky Schroeder and the My pillow guy helped bail out a mass murdering illegal gun owner...2020 just keeps surprising me.     sidenote: all mass murderers have fans and admirers I shouldn't be that surprised.
After reading up on some of the comments and seeing the actions that unfolded that night there is nothing to laugh at. 2 people are dead and the third in a blink of an eye has to live with his actions whether he or they were right. Life's were changed and some destroyed.
I wish idiots could get chased by a mob of angry people, kicked, rocks thrown at you and then being prepared to be trampled on and kicked on the ground possibly killed and say u wouldn't shoot them 🤦‍♂️
For all the people wondering what white privilege is, this is it.
Ima buy a My Pillow right now.
HIS LAST WORDS OF CLIP. HE CLAIMS HE WAS ACTING IN SELF DEFENSE. WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED ON TV. HE DIDN'T CLAIM $H!T HE IS INNOCENT. THE NEWS ANCHOR'S  ARE A JOKE.
This smeels like biden
Killer!
What ever happened to innocent until proven guilty???
Thank God it was filmed......most self defense claims aren’t.
That kid shouldn't have been in wisconsin during that time but if you watch the full video in it's entirety it's clear it was self defense. I mean when you got the pillow guy and silver spoons backing you up you should feel comfortable. Your golden.
Crazy people defend the criminals and want to prosecute citizen helping to protect property, freedom, and country. Leftist and Dems are absolute disastrous for a free country.
If Biden gets in this is how life will be. We all better get armed and ready to defend ourselves against the left who think they can do whatever they want, then cry when when people fight back. Just like this case!
He didn't murder anyone, he killed a RIOTER who went for his long gun to assault him (Kyle), multiple people with guns went at him while holding or pointing at pistol at the kid. HE DID NOTHING WRONG. LITERALLY NOTHING WRONG, he exercised extremely good control and patience as well.
Gets attacked by a mob, kills a pedophile in self defense.  The left: “how dare he”
This kid is a murderer. Lindell is a pos
I'm not a trump fan but I find it appalling that news media these days have to always bring up who supports who as if it matters. "My pillow founder who is a trump supporter" Like really? Is that even necessary? Him being a trump supporter has absolutely no meaning in this report...
What a joke
can you post bail for the person that he killed?
He "claims" he was acting in self-defense? There is video footage of exactly what happened. Why am I not surprised that Today is acting this way. If kyle was black he would held up as an idol for BLM.
0:19 How disgusting does a person have to be to wear that shirt after killing innocent people
I HATE THE MY PILLOW GUY SOOOOOOOO MUCH I GET HIS ADS EVERYDAY AND WANNA SCREAM!!!
Why did they grant a murderer bail?? Am I missing something?
Well I see the Celebrity Trump Zombies are all out in full force, and poor Kyle is the only one who could of taken any head shots? LMSFAO!
Best Christmas 🎁 Gift 🎁 Of The Year , SoooO Glad That He Is Home With His Family Again For The Holidays.
Evil is real.
All you far left rioter looters , when someone comes after you with weapons and intent , don't protect yourself.
HE SHOULD HAVE NOT BEEN IN JAIL. HE HAD AS MUCH RIGHT AS ANYONE TO BE WHERE HE WAS. IF ANYONE OF YOU WERE IN HIS POSITION YOU WOULD HAVE DONE SAME DAM THING.
Hero
The man who posted bail for the teen want the publicity that why he did it
Have you guys seen the video? No way he will be convicted of first degree homicide. One of the clearest cases of self defense imaginable.
@ Siggie Tyrone, not me lol.
God bless him!
The Kenosha Kid rides again.
Good for him.
What do you mean he "claims" that he was acting in self defense? He was acting in self defense! Those idiots were going to hurt him.
*My Pillow 2024!*  🎵 _Let's Make America Sleep Again!_ 🎵
America hero
This pillow guy is inserting himself into too many places.  What's he up to?
So much journalism.
Now white people are going to boycott the guy. Tough break, but you get what you get.
Self defense
Donate to Kyle's defense!! People from all over the world have because they can clearly see it was self defense!!  https://www.givesendgo.com/GUCZ
Good
i will finally buy a my pillow just for this 1
Good! This kid is innocent!
He shot a pedo, a felon and a woman beater so perfect hat trick and how is he a white suprematist if he shot white guys and he’s mixed race
Wow
God Bless these Patriots
you mean self defense, not homicide.
Awesome!  I'm sorry that he had to spend so much time locked up.
If you watched the entire unedited videos of the riots and shootings that night,  Mr. Rittenhouse obviously was running away from his attackers, the mob of looters and rioters were assaulting him.  One of them fired the first shot, not reported by the globalist marxist MSM
Wtf
Kyle looks pretty happy for having killed 2 people, whatever the reason.  Perhaps a little more humility and a lower profile would be in order.
Let’s gooo 🙏
Posted 2.5 mil but when I ask a celeb for $300 they don’t even look at my dm smh
fact: Rosenbaum died doing what he loved; chasing minors.
So, he illegally purchased a firearm, crossed state borders with it, murdered two people.. and now he's a millionaire walking free? Okay.
Good. Didn't deserve a bail that high. He was assaulted!
Hmmm.
I have to admit, those are some dadgum good pillows. And Mr. Lindell and Mr. Shroder are good men for getting an innocent man out of jail. There's something very amiss with this system if you can't protect yourself from being beaten to death by a vicious criminal mob. He did what he had to do to save his life.
I'm burning all of my own mypillows, thank is horrible
He was acting in self defense.
I used to love Ricky Schroeder until now. 🙁
Whitewash at it's Best (Hypocrites)
Seems like some weird fetish
White privileged
2 million dollar bail = needs to post 200k to be released. Dirt cheap advertising for my pillow.
I used to like Schroeder. Not now.
free kyle
how does someone show up to a protest with a ar-15 and claim self defense???????
FINALLY! He should be rewarded for what he did.
I was going to send rittenhouse money but it accidentally burned up in this church is was burning down.
What a stupid boy
White supremacy is real. Imagine if this guy was a minority...
No matter how you want to perceive his actions, it's irrefutable that if these type of idiots hadn't been rampaging in various cities around the nation for months already, unfettered, then actual kids wouldn't be taking it upon themselves to do this. Rest assured the majority of people who dont support him arent fully informed on what happened and are seeing only what's on CNN or the like.
Look at how much glee and pleasure these evil people take in glorifying a cold-blooded mass murderer!
This is why self defense should be illegal
*two felons
Disgusting! Fu@k u Ricky!
I love how loaded and biased this short report is
better keep that rifle on you boy
Hey it's the kid who went hunting people! The MYPillow guy! He wears his cross outside his shirt so not to confuse anyone that his last name sounds Jewish.
Kyle is a hero
2 million dollars bail for defending yourself ?     Domestic terrorists are in for a rude awakening when the people don't care anymore and take matters in their own hands.
Alright, who's ready for more protests?
Disgusting and despicable.
Rittenhouse caused Covid 19! Like if you get the ref
Murderer posing with actor who's career died decades ago. Judgement's coming for all of them; except for Ricky. He's irrelevant like his career.
TODAY IS DELETING COMMENTS THAT THEY DON'T LIKE
youre kidding me
I mean he was defending himself
Good for him this young man is a real Patriot.
You mean The Jacob Blake Riot!  Kyle a hero!
Hope you loose a lot of business
Liberals are the most ignorant people who ever lived in the entire history of the earth .
LET'S GOOOOOOO!
KYLE YOU ARE A TRUE HERO, You Will not have to serve time in prison.. Keep your head up.. We are praying for you, and your family.....
TOP KEK! KEK WILLED IT
This is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
Snowflakes are going to be protesting pillows now. In the streets yelling "no justice no sleep “.
Awesome!
There is no bottom to sleaze on the Right in this country.
If only these 3 put same energy & money into feeding or housing homeless. Just a thought
In totalitarian libtardia if you're not a woke violent leftist ,you are not allowed to defend yourself.  You can be beaten and killed and it's a jail sentence if you lift a finger to protect yourself.  This is insane
He is still going to trial  for the killings,  the families of the dead want justice. Court is no joke with evidence a judge can give you life or death.
Anyone with eyes knows it was self defense. The boy was running to the police when he was chased down and hit in the head with a skate board. This prosecution is completely unfounded. Leftism is the new fascism.
It was self defense watch the videos...plus the people he shot are felons.
G fuel
Its some sick people in this world!
Self defense. Drop all charges.
“He claims he was acting in self defense” um we’ve all seen the videos. He was. You wanna talk about having a gun at a protest or his age or being out past the curfew that goes for everyone that was out there too. Regardless of everything else the act of him shooting was clearly in self defense.
ONLY true idiots would buy those pillows now.
American hero! Trump 2020
Good job Mike a d company
Self defense , watch the video of the shooting.
He shot those guys in self defense..
So glad he's out. You shouldn't be in jail for self defense.
Thanks Kyle for defending the black community from antifa terrorists. This is partly why I voted for trump this year. Democrats kept supporting antifa/blm terrorists burning down black communities all over the country.
He still goes on trial
Yay Kyle is free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kids a hero . More people need to stop antfa blm terrorists from destroying everything.
These people are disgusting!!!!!!!!!
All the racist
Even though the 'men' he killed were a pedophile, and two felons... Okay.
This man protected himself he had every right
All the racist
BETTER DEAD THAN RED.
Is it me or has Rittenhouse had as much plastic surgery as Khloe Kardashian?
Kyle Rittenhouse Is An American Hero.
im glad he is out but this news network is crap
Hes guilty of nothing.   It was self defense.  It is a travesty that he was ever arrested.  It's right on video.
And what about Antifa and BLM terrorists??? This innocent patriot gets jail and those savages burning and pillaging our country get nothing..no punishment...man I can't wait until the flip happens...reckoning coming soon
Time to get me some new pillows.
Before you argue with a conservative in the comments remember they think the election is fraud with 0 evidence and constant cases being thrown out by every court while also losing all the recounts. Ask yourself who you’re trying to argue with and just move on with your life.
Just watch the videos NBC.
Murderous Kyle Rittenflunky. Should've been at a job working instead of running around with a machine gun killing other lazy turds. No winners here. 🤷‍♂️
I guess no one saw the maltov cocktail that was thrown at him that didn’t ignite.  A group of thugs and pedophiles trying to light a gas station on fire, Kyle puts fire out and armed thugs chasing after him.  Completely justified.
I’m getting everybody a pillow for christmas😎
His shirt is golden
If Kyle was a Mexican, Muslim or African American, all his "fans" in the comments would be saying throw him in jail.
Youngin just needed to become a cop before killing people in the name of "protecting the community". America has paths for this thing. No patience.
Good to know since I'm white I can legally shoot people now if I suspect that they look at me funny and the supposed "pro-life" crowd can support me
Extra careful when he goes out on public.
The Kenosha Kid.... Making Dirtbags Take Dirtnaps. Brought to you today in Partnership with Black Rifle Coffee Company and My Pillow!!!😉
Kyle Rittenhouse is a LEGEND. Taking out the Human Garbage in the streets. AMERICAN HERO
Whoa, Schroeder? Where's he been hiding?
"Claims"? No he WAS acting in self defense.  That being said, did not see this coming. Silver Spoons and My Pillow bailed him out. The only way this could get better is if Trump himself pardons him.
If our justice system was working, he wouldn't have been in jail so long before bail was set.
Kyle is a garbage human !
Basically buying a My Pillow now
It was in self defense, you can see in the video the “Medic” had a gun in his hand and was aiming at the young guy.
Leave it to a crack head like Michael. "Buy my pillows so I can buy more crack!"
He had no business being out there but oh well there is other justice besides the law😄
It could be self defense but he had no business being their in the first place
Sleep on that lol.
IF HE WAS BLACK  HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE DEATH PENALTY!! AND. ... HE STILL SHOULD!!
The kid needs to sit in prison until he's 80
My Pillow Biter is a "Fine Christian".   (Edited to clarify my sarcasm.)
👏👏👏👏
My Hero.
SHAME
Thank God
That Moment when Dad calls our Company Accountant and tells her to order 1,000 Pillows before 5 pm. "Priceless".
gotta love those trump supporters. Always doing the right thing. Like bailing out murderers!
Good companies to boycott
🚨⌛But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”~Revelation
Did Ricky Schroeder need publicity this bad? Obviously, since he only lasted on NYPD Blue for one season! Wow! I am speechless! What happened in this world where someone who killed people can get out of jail and have a big smile on their faces before the trial...guilty or not! I'm confused!
Kyle Rittenhouse is an American Hero.
Imagine if a black guy from Compton drove all the way to Montana to a Trump rally. Then was attacked by Trump supporters and shot 3, murdering 2... Oh how the picture would be painted so different, definitely not getting bail... And im talking about even with a legally owned weapon!
Does that that mean I can shoot someone if they look at me cross-eyed? Oh wait, those are my crossed eyes.
White racist people. Don, they get tired of being racist. Too many stories like these are too familiar.
Why was a 17 yr out in the streets with a gun? What did the mother do when she saw her 16 yr old at a protest...she went down there and got him...child is safe...this child being charged with murder a waste, just a unnecessary waste of life... Didn't have to happen.
Kyle Rittenhouse > George Floyd
Kyle looks Dumb in the Face, why was he walking around Armed During a Volitile Situation at 17?? If He was Trained and Under the Leadership of a Militia WITH them I wouldn't care. He should have Stayed Home gotten Stoned n played Video Games like a normal 17 year old.
I won’t be sleeping on any of those pillows
He did what Trump subtly told him to do.
Why did he feel the need to bring a weapon if he thought it would be dangerous? Shouldn't law enforcement handle it? Little boy was playing vigilante and got the opportunity he wanted to shoot someone....and it is celebrated. There is something wrong with that.
I think the news should stop reporting onall these racist bigots and never speak their names again!
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Lock him up!
Good for him, putting him in jail for defending himself from lunatics would have been messed up.
Outstanding! Maybe it's time to buy a new pillow.
This is FCKNG OUTRAGEOUS! This is a young murderous thug and should be in a cage for the rest of his days, standing beside this killer as if they've committed some pious deed is beyond logic and deserve disgust from every law-abiding citizen of this country. What a waste of monies...
Best news I've heard in a while. Kyle deserves freedom! And, who knew ricky schroeder was based?!
Find a good place to hide, maybe build a cave with pillows.  You guys are idiots.
I WILL be buying several MY PILLOWS as Christmas gifts this year.
Good for Kyle. A true patriot!!
It wasn't jake blake protest. It was full on riots and looting.
POS
It was defense leftist media!!!
He shouldn't have ever been in jail. Clear self defense. They attacked him and one of them he shot had a pistol anf was fixing to shot him. Bo matter how you all try to paint it. The videos speak for there self.
that is my boi
He was most definitely acting in self defense.
Give him a medal & more ammo.
This kid goes across state lines with an AR-15 which, is his legal right to do he was hired for security, which is his legal right to accept the job. But as a former security guard 💂‍♂️ , armed I have to say I was trained I was certified I was insured and I have the backing of a company with lawyers in case of something bad happening. this kid had none of those things. yes he was expressing his rights as a US citizen but those rites are going to be chewed up by a Jewish lawyer, say hi to prison kid 👦🏼
Glad he's out. If it wasn't for the crazy Leftist mob. He'd already be a free man. Hopefully his lawyer can make it permanent.
That teenager deserves spend at least 65 years in jails for his 2 crimes
gross
Patriots....all three of them. I’ll be buying some pillows this week.
Mike Lindell is a very gross and disturbing man.
He shouldn’t even have been there to begin with. He’s a child who thought it was a good idea to take a weapon across state lines to a high stress protest and every single adult in this situation enabled him.  And the fact that so many of y’all are so cool and supportive of the fact that a child killed two ppl is disgusting I don’t care if it was self defense— he took peoples lives and he went there ready to do that   y’all should be ashamed acting like this isn’t awful that he was in that situation to begin with and it turned out that way
That Mike Pillow is a real piece of work.
"Why can't we just all get along".
Rittenhouse did nothing wrong
Give him the death penalty, nothing less
Life or the chair
That's great! Now citizens will take the law in their own hands...
Time to sue the fake news
Hero
If Kyle Rittenhouse wasn’t white he’d already be in prison for life. This is why they were protesting the police in the first place. This country is despicable
God bless the pillow man.
Rick Schroeder is lame!!! a has been ,schame on you freeing a muderder☹
Self defense 👍
The communist are pist this white kid successfully defended himself, and was not assassinated in the street!!!! 😂
Hopefully he gets the needle
Well that was a waste of money. The skateboard guy he killed was running away from him so self defense is out the window.  🤦‍♂️
What another actor that has morals and common sense and I though all are educated beyond their intelligence
God bless you Kyle. MY HERO.
he went looking for a fight... he shouldn't have been there.. period!!
Yeah buddy keep fighting !
Me, actually living in kenosha reading this while on vacation out of state. 👁👄👁
👍👍
I, and many other Americans, were watching it happen live!! It was clearly self defence. I would have done the same thing.
Cant believe how they are messing with this kid. He defended himself plain and simple.
He is white that is why they went easy on him
Weather or not it’s self defense the kid is stupid af for being in that situation and his parents are even dumber for allowing him to leave. Dumb people raise dumb kids it’s a cycle.
Why was bail so high? Why didnt the biden capaign bail him out for violence committed during a peaceful protest like they did for the BLM and Antifa folks? From the video though it looks like self defense to me.
Only trash would bail him out, not surprised...they both will soon be in the poor house since we know they did this
Don't let this distract you from the L Trump took during the election!
Excellent!!!
Dude gonna enjoy his time in prison being someone’s b.i.t.ch
BRAVO RITTENHOUSE.
and now i'll be throwing away my My Pillow...
Glad to see you released! You are being railroaded, you will be well represented and exonerated. I am sorry this happened to you!
“Claims” he was defending himself? Do you see how evil & manipulative the media is?.... no that’s what happened! There’s videos out there if you did not know you should do your job and stop lying to the people to appease your delusional hate filled low information base! They have to keep the lie to their grave in order to justify their defense for antifa and BLM even at the expense of children! Rittenhouse school is not political he just wanted to do the right thing because he’s a good person and the Covington Catholic boys! MEDIA IS DISGUSTING!! you people should be locked up!
It’s his fathers fault , send him to jail and the kid to therapy,
If i did that as a latino id be up da road no bond hold...he took life he must pay with his life that is the way....it dont matter he aint safe on these streets
Yea lets hope it all works out and true justice is served i havent seen all evidence so i dont know whos guilty or not.
Great American Heroes...
TlDW HL” Trumps “my pillow” crony paid, a murder’s bail.
Wow he killed there's  no excuse  for that. Why was he allowed  to carry assault  weapon.  If he's not white carrying that kind of weapon  right away he will be arrested, but no he got bailed.  No justice ,money talk. This just sickening a minor carrying  assault  weapon and killed and supported by rich.Pathetic
Went straight to defending himself. Good lord, I’m afraid for this country.
Cheese & Rice Ricky Schroder? Dude, that's as random as Brian Boitano on _South Park._
He better enjoy the short vacation while he can. He's got a LONG time to look forward to stuck in those cells.
Kyle Rittenhouse!  Nice job on taking care of the Antifa shytbags!!!!
This is a pogchamp moment
What a waste of money he's still going to jail lol
I’m not surprised😂😂😂😂
YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for this, it made my day better.
Woo hoo
Thank you jesus
White privilege at its finest no matter how you see it
Lock him up forever!
Good for him!
The video shows that it was self defense. Hopefully, he'll get a fair trial and be able to get on with his life.
He will wind up in the chain gang as some bodys lil cute wifey....
are people still mad about this 1 of the 2 people he killed was a convicted pedophile you ask me he did the community a service
This is the best thing I've heard in a long long long long long time I am so happy for you I'm sorry what you went through please understand it was not your fault
Bought a my pillow years ago,  will be burning it
Reminder commies aren't ppl.
chill trumpies, i cant dislike all of ur comments 🙄
@Ben Dover...and what is your username again? Isn't is ironic don't you think.
what even is this
Kyle should be profiled as an AMERICAN hero!!!
this is a good thing prison he can join a gang and become worse now we can just cap him and be done with it
Rittenhouse committed premeditated murderer. Those around him, before and after, are accessories. The law will get them, or the LAW will get them.
Awesome.  I'm buying more sheet & pillows.
ya'll want to defund the police, but ya'll out here getting clapped by 17 year olds determined that... was a lie. best meme ever lmao
let him fryyyyyyyyy
R u kidding
Finally some good news!
He WAS acting in self defense. Anybody with half a brain that thinks critically and doesn't believe everything on CNN can see that.
Lock that punk up! Life in prison, boy!
Enough of giving this little chubby murderer a platform. There was a little too much glee from the Today show host while gurgling out what sounded more like a piece on holiday recipes. WTF ?
I love that coffee
The NYT reported how he was being chased and shot at by multiple people for putting out a dumpster fire 🔥 set by the protesters.  I just love how you leave out facts out that might inform the public in what actually happened that night.  There are other questions that the court will have to determined maybe the Supreme Court such as does having a weapon as a minor take away one’s right to defend themselves simply for the fact that they are not allowed to have them.  Do one’s constitutional rights become null and void if one is a minor and only become enforceable at the age of 18 or other age determined by the state’s legislatures.  The have done it with a minimum age to drive, vote, purchase alcohol and when one can get married.
Yeah because this 17 year old teen wasn’t running around with an AR and killing people with it. Self defense or not he took the lives of 2 people that night. Talk about white privilege.
1 out of every 3 Trump supporters is just as DANGEROUS as the other 2.
Two people are dead and this kid is smiling. Tha he is being enabled b these people is sick.
*rittenhouse claims a business owner asked for help 'to protect' his business. the business owner in question - flatly stated that was not true - saying he never asked nor hired anyone to protect his business. rittenhouse said because he was on 'furlough' from his ymca job - he got stimulus money. which he then used (to pay a friend of legal age, who has also now been charged) - to purchase the rifle. his attorneys stated that prior to the shootings that day - he was working at the ymca. rittenhouse claims he 'would have died that night'. yet rittenhouse was self-appointed in his involvement and would end up being chased by a crowd who wanted him stopped - because he'd just shot a man 4 times in the chest. social media accounts show him to be an avid 'back the blue' follower: a movement much like blue lives matter, both of which began only after - and in direct response to - black lives matters.*  links:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/11/19/kyle-rittenhouse-says-he-doesnt-regret-bringing-gun-to-kenosha-hes-not-part-of-a-militia/?sh=7b0e09aa429f     https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2020/10/30/details-rittenhouse-arrest-after-kenosha-shooting-shown-records/6092483002/     https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/kyle-rittenhouse-used-stimulus-money-to-cover-gun-purchase-interview-reveals    https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2020/09/03/kenosha-car-dealer-denies-he-asked-gunmen-protect-his-business/5705974002/
Why are they attacking this kid and not the guy who came after him with a gun & to mention the mob chasing & knocked him down!!! What has happened to other ppl Antifa & blm knocked down?  They got brutally assaulted or killed! What would anyone have done in that situation???
Pathetic
He should definitely try some of those pills my pillow guy had
anyone that thinks this is alright ill see you
God knows what they did to his behind in jail.
Let’s go
This Kids is a Hero,  Stopped two convicted thugs from hurting him.
Claims-He was acting in self defense.  Media is all the same.  3 Shots for Kyle 🍺
Watched the video ten times. Still not sure what he did wrong.
Glad hes out!
OK.... I need to go buy a My Pillow now
Michael Drejka Jr
This is some hilarious ish.
It's good that many WS are outing themselves. Not good for them, but good.
Alright. Good news
Too bag they couldn't get Timothy mcveigh too
This whole thing is stupid. He should have known better, but he also didn't murder anyone. $2M bail is ridiculous. I'm glad they got him out.
Young hero.
Awww not the pillow guy ..😭 u ghad dayum traitor😂
Pretty cut and dry self defense. Charge now for the mob but dismiss later when the mob moves on to something else
out free but will have a lifetime of public harassment
This kid is the embodiment of evil and white supremacy.
😂😂 He will get away with it all too...
He is on bail. He still faces 2 charges of murder and his lawyers are having about as much success as thumper's lawyers who are failing in 99% of their filings trying to steal the election.
Well looks like I gotta buy my pillow products now
Sliver Spoons pays the way
Awesome that he's home with his family❤️
2 million for a domestic terrorist ?! LAMES 🤮
Based my pillow guy
He will go to jail.  I hope he runs. And these losers loss their money ..
Those pillows smell like chemicals. This is just one more reason not to buy one.
Must be nice to be white. I wonder if i would get a bailout if i shot a white supremist in self defense. I wonder.....
Nice you bring a deadly weapon not your fight.but it becomes your fight getting bailed out by fraudulent pillow manufacture.whos failed attempt to rub elbows with politics.also a snake oil salesman smells like are republicans
next time on the air "the making of an Amerikkkan sociopath!
In America, as of this moment, there is children and homeless living in poverty..can they get 2 million?
Amen!
Cause it was self defense
my pillow will lose a lot of business by posting bail for a murderer... but he was going to anyway for supporting a traitor trump
Kyle did nothing wrong.
Kyle is a hero. At most he needs to be charged with unlawful possession of a firearm if anything. All other charges need to be dropped
At least the pedophiles that attacked him won't be touching our kids anymore.
whoaah i wouldnt think that Michael Lindell would be helping this kid haha..
The My Pillow guy is such a wacko, I’m so glad I never bought any of his pillows and never will.  On a related note, his claim that his pillows are rated the most comfortable are totally BS, the rating he advertises are the ratings from a side company he owns. If you looking for a comfortable pillow GOOGLE it for the real actual ratings, My Pillow is definitely NOT at the top of the real actual ratings.
Well you can easily check his claims of self defense by watching the video....and 100% confirming it
All I can think of is; this is a very corrupt and irresponsible system.  The white boy gets away with killing 2 people!!
Day of the pillow soon
😎
You guys know this kid is on video punching a girl in the face, right? Jail too good for him.
Good! God Bless Kyle Rittenhouse! God Bless Mike Lindell and anyone else who helped that boy out! He did nothing illegal and should be free.  #freekyle #Kyleisinnocent
Wtf is wrong w these have been stars? Ricky,  Le!
more crooked trump supporters.... wow ricky ,i am shocked by this. thought you were smarter than that.....
I dont understand youtube allowing this post. Sad
Jan. 20th cannot come soon enough.
He shot the nazi zombies going for his freedoms.
Hey BLM and antifa get bailed out when they go to jail by the wealthy Hollywood elite what's the difference
I'm buying my pillows for Christmas gifts. Ricky Schroeder was always great actor and good guy. Good luck Kyle Patriots everywhere support you. Defund Brown People.
A minor, crossed state lines, armed, to go to a protest. Murders two people, and is now the victim?   Failure to logic. Uniquely Conservative.
A shame!!!! He should have had no bail.
Hey they would be alive if there I,Q was more than 20 to attack someone with a gun lol 😆
Idk who any of these people are.
based MyPillow, Kyle Rittenhouse was a hero and a patriot
Yay now i can bust a cap
I'm just hear to read all the comments from Russian trolls
gonna go buy some my pillows now.
Imagine having a murderer as a hero. Not only is a he a murderer he is also a child. They are glorifying a child for killing ppl. These are the same ppl who abhor abortion. But murdering protestors that he threatened with a gun that's just fine. As long as he is killing ppl challenging white supremacy. The same ppl celebrate Dylan Roof they just do it in secret.
its about time. phuck yah.
That's it, I'm never buying that stupid my pillow!
This is sad i mean think about it..cops are trained to de escalate a situation and be calm under pressure but this kid from what i understand seems as if he was trying to help maintain order which in some respect is admirable. But none the less a kid with a riffle is knocked down and scared he gets up and shoot 2 people  He is still wrong and that why it should be left for trained professionals.
So glad to see Kyle out of jail. Now he can help in his own defense proving he acted in self defense.
He killed two people in cold blood! It will be interesting to see the outcome of this case smh. I regret being a silverspoons fan growing up. These true colors are shining through everyone you thought was better than that.
Let the streets take that SOB
There is No Justice in this country, stupid people killings inosent people
Unbelievable
This freedom for Kyle Ritenhouse won't be lasting very long at all. He will stand trial as an adult for two counts of first degree murder and another count of attempted murder along with felony weapons charges. Kyle Ritenhouse will be found guilty. He will go to prison for forty or fifty years plus without parole. I don't know what there is to celebrate or feel proud of here. He wasn't defending himself because his mother drove him across statelines with an illegal weapon to LOOK for trouble and he created a double homicide event and an attempted homicide event with malice aforethought. His life is overwith, period, full stop.
I'm  glad to see any positive coverage of this OH SO OBVIOUS CASE OF SELF DEFENSE. Thanks to someone who has the resources that jumps in and assists.  Am a customer and will continue to be!!!
All I’m sayin is that he’s a pretty good shot under pressure.
Who tf are all these guys? Their names sound like some McDonalds menu items
This is unfair and why bail needs to be outlawed. Just think out the victims families and that a KILLER was just released from jail 😞
Didnt have x child star and my pillow guy bail out murderer on my 2020 bingo card
This kid was defending himself!
It was self-defense wtg Kyle
He should have never been allowed to walk the streets with an AR! What did you think was gonna happen? He should go to prison and we need gun reform. Guns are fine for sport, hunting, and of course protection but NO PERSON should be allowed at any time to walk down the street with an ASSAULT rifle. It's just common sense.
Great young man!
Of course one person is a con artist and the other was a child actor you can’t trust!
If people are chasing me and I’m feeling threaten like my life is on the line I’m shooting them...
The Pillow Guy, another religious con artist, is on a hot streak. He claimed a few weeks ago that God had given him a cure for Covid-19; now he bails out a murderer...
this was big time self defense.  all the videos proves that.
It clearly was self defense. He should never have had to spend time in jail. Please pardon this young man.
He has such a fetching look about him. I’ll bet he made friends fast!,,
They wouldn't have saved the kid and helped him out if he wasn't innocent. I personally think this is great. Tell Antifa to sit down.
That guy tried to light this kid on fire ... 100% self defense.
Ricky Schroeder is a has been..
My pillows guy is a crackhead drug addict
Lol  Murder on the loose..
Traitor Trump’s psychopath MAGAt on the loose.
Kyle is a hero, so young and yet was able to defend himself from the attacks of a pedophile, a wife beater and some other lefty loon.
It clearly was self defense. He should never have had to spend time in jail. Please pardon this young man.
Vote America 2020!
My Pillow free marketing.
If I was being chased by people with guns, I'd blow their brains off too.
Finally a little bit of good news!
It's unfortunate that such a young mind got brainwashed by this evil thug we finally voted out of office. Where was Donny to bail one of his followers out? Guess the my pillow guy ex crack addict counts huh.  Just said to see a young life ruined by that vile con man. May God reward Trump for all the evil he has done to his fellow man. He and he alone will have to answer for his life.
This is disgusting behavior by our fellow humans
Mr Rittenhouse gonna be like Mr Sandman to the media. You batter get your chapter 11 ready or you will pay like the 2 time offender your platform is.
When you get involved with a criminal for all the free publicity. Shame on both of you idiots. My Pillow will be going down in flames, Rick’s career already has.
Congratulations to he and his family. It was self defense and the greater majority in America know that.
Rittenhouse didn't take out all three armed targets going after him. I'm disappointed in that.
Kyle Rittenhouse is a good boy.
All 3 of them are giving the "Soy Boy" Smile in that pic
Rip my pillow revenues
Nazis looking after each other
WAIT WHAT? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It is so nice to see them so cozy and maskless. Especially since all the trump cohorts are coming and have come down with the virus. Stupidity knows no boundaries.
Those MyPillows go well with MAGA pillowcases.
Lets all cry for convicted child molester he killed... oh wait lol
So those are  the dumbasses who posted his bail 🙄 he’s still going back there & hopefully die in prison
For some reason
how to you let someone out of jail bond after killing two people
For some reason
BDS the Bigs. ShakeUp!
George Zimmerman jr.
I hope Kyle Rittenhouse spends the rest of his pathetic life in prison! I'd like to think that his parents are embarrassed by  their son "the murderer" but I think he's the way he is because of them! Didn't his so called mother drive him over state lines, with the long gun, to do the killing? SHAME ON YOU! 😝
lol people chase him with guns and the media be like "HE claims it was self-defense." these media reporters should be in jail
Good for him.  Anyone with eyes can see it was self defense.
Sick!
So this is okay now?  Do they think callously killing is something celebrate?  Watch your head kid.  Those who live by the sword  die by the sword.  Don't have words low enough for those who support (and are financing) this murderer.
Where can we send money for his defense?
Kyle is the star!
I don't blame the young man for his actions. I blame Mr. Trump. Young uneducated teens do things with a fuddled mind. Yes he must pay for his crimes. But Mr. Trump may be at the root of this young mans thinking.
WE ALL SAW HIM ATTACKED!!1 WTF??
Who is going to burn their  my pillow now..
Title should read "Self-Defense Suspect Posts Bail."
Kyle should have never had to spend one night in jail
if you dont think he was acting in self defense then you have truly let your political bias change your basic instincts
Yet another example America needs... a moral enema.
What a hero - bunch of asswipes
I'm buying ALL my friends and family My Pillows for Christmas!
He looks tough when he's holding a weapon.
If this is what a hero looks like (actions) we are in a lot of trouble. The smiles to hold up someone that took the lives of two people. (unarmed)  ugh
Self defense from rioters, not peaceful protesters. Kid has more guts than the entire left.
Imagine waking up and realized you were that stupid to begin with. And then even dumber to give away money to a lost cause....
This wouldn’t even matter if it wasn’t boosted.  Why even promote it. That poor child .stuck between tow sides of misunderstanding of LOVE! 😞
Ricky Schroeder AND the My Pillow guy?!!! I guess since this Lindell character couldn't get his quasi covid cure to work he's doing an even more stupid thing with his money. Helping to release a killer from jail.
Little Murderer getting to go home on bail, disgusting. Trumpits must be loving their win here.   Domestic Terrorists should be treated like the terrorists they are.
🤦 white privilege and I'm over it. If he was a black kid or mexican kid, we'd all be watching the story play out differently. This is sickening. He killed people. There is no justification for that.
My help that means for the pillow I bought at Walmart
2 million!! Boy I hope he get his time in our America court system.
A murderer and his psycho show biz friends.
People are pressed he didn't go to jail for defending himself.
He goes there while carrying an AK illegally and a first aid kit. Like the black guy said, he is asking who needs first aid while carrying a rifle locked and loaded and no badge or ID to identify him as a medic, emt or first responder. The way he was carrying, would make me move out of his way in a hurry. My two cents..
Kyle is a hero
He only shot in self defense..
Meanwhile, biden & harris bail out thousands of real criminals...
Send that nazi back in prison  Death sentence!!!
Dont say mean things coming from those that burn down your cities ,loot your stores,   put people out of work .,.
LIMIT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS TO RESONSIBLE JOURNALISM
Yuck
People working for My Pillow guy: *Panik*
Good for them! The videos show that Kyle was fighting for his life! He never should have been charged in the 1st place! I refuse to hit like on this video because the Propaganda reader stated that Kyle "claimed he was defending himself". The Propaganda Media are the enemies of our Constitutional Republic
Looks like it is time to buy a few pillows.
No murder here. Self Defense and it was being committed by two felons upon this young man.
Ricky seems to have gone in the way of a nut job...
Great News!  This boy should never have been charged for defending himself from thugs.  Good to see some very decent people out there!
<3 i support #kenoshakyle
Mass media is hiding this. The Democrats are scared. https://hereistheevidence.com/  #CountOnlyLegalVotes
shocked to hear he'd only just now gotten bail
Encouraging another murderers for trump cult, just another mall shooting today in Minnesota
Hey Kyle! Now that you are out can I get you gun and invite you to my town? And I have a lovely daughter your age that is brainwashed by her  college to vote Democrook, a good honest American boy might help her see the light!  ;]
I live in Minnesota and I am so disappointed. Bc if I am correct Minnesota had always been a democratic state. Meaning we had always looked forward to new changes for the future and not be stuck in the past like the republicans are. 😔
KR should never have seen the inside of a jail cell.
Another political prosecution.  Either way, liberals or conservatives, this isn't justice.
Just ordered 10 My Pillows and the box set of Silver Spoons.
Bizarre. Anyone walking around carrying a firearm like that is not exactly acting in self defense, he was asking for it and probably should have been the one who got it
Well, this is new.  I hope they shafted.
Once again the right wing republiCons proving that they can go even lower....
My Pillow Guy is so incredibly based
Smfh
Ricky is dead to everyone except the republicans.  I hope they pay well.
Heroism is NOT killing people because you saw a ghost. Rottenhouse is a trashbag and shall be treated as such. NO work for this turd.
Civilian: can you fluff my pillow? Rittenhouse: eat lead.
Good! Because it was self defense. He would be dead if he didn’t take the actions that he took. He better have all his rights restored as well.
should never have been in jail. self defense is not a crime. its all caught on camera, its very clear what happened. those involved in jailing him are the ones who belong in jail.  and 2 million, total violation of his 8th.
after 40 years schroeder just lost this fan
2 million dollar bail for self defense? What a joke... if he does time, it'll be time for a judicial overhaul. 1st degree murder will never stick. Thats the same as saying ALL concealed open/carriers are guilty of 1st degree murder if they have to defend themselves with a firearm. This gun grabbing nonsense has got to end. There is no debating self defense - period. If you don't want to protect yourself, that's your stupidity, but don't thwart the rights of those of us that do.
My Pillow memory foam on the inside of an AR sling ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, can't wait to see Kyle in a commercial.
I just got back from an interstate "self-defense" Kyle Rottenhouse activity.
Should have killed more of those animals!
That child had no business even being there, they should be charging his parents for allowing him access to a gun and allowing him to be there . He  should have never been placed in that position in the first place .
IN SELF DEFENCE; KYLE KILLED A FEW MARXIST COCKROACHES... GOOD.
I'm glad he's out
huh...no black celebs helped him out? Wierd, you would think they would put thier tremendous money towards justice and content of character but i guess not.
Kyle can't join the military but he can become a pig...
we got people spending life sentences for possessing weed but they wanna bail out a guy who killed two people...america
I JUST HEARD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ; lol
Hurray!!!
For everyone smugly assuming he won’t face charges, any chance of a self defense case is gonna get thrown out the window as he illegally had the firearm and deliberately antagonized protesters. Glad the chud MyPillow guy wasted 2 million.
Jacob Blake riots stupid
enjoy your freedom while it lasts...
When you're Ricky Schroder and dont get top billing for a $2M bailout.....instead it goes to the My Pillow guy. LMAO
Does anyone know this guy location?
He getting 25 years or more bye bye
Kyle Rittenhouse is a murderer and the people in these comments show why God left humanity alone to fend for themselves.
2 million at 10% $200k. Nice chunk of non refundable change. And he is definitely not a flight risk. Kinda wish I was still in bail bonds.😩😩😩
Country isnt perfect by any means, but that kid has bigger issues than just a gun.
Good to see this young man released. Hopefully things will go well for him and his family.
I wish there was a youtube channel with educated lawyers talking about the penal codes and laws that play into the case rather than mass uneducated media outlets providing snippets and their own personal opinions. It would be nice to learn about how the laws are interpreted in a court setting.
The videos proved it was self defense you twit media hack ... now pardon me while I go buy some MY PILLOWS
MONEY does not care who owns it.  Next time donate to people who have to wait in line for hours for food.  (without a pillow).
Nobody famous ever gets me out of jail 👍.
I will be burning My Pillow!!!!😖
after 40 years schroeder just lost this fan
Glad that young man is out! I’ll be buying a pillow from The My Pillow Guy.
I just wanna know what kind of parent encourages there 17 year old kid to cross state lines with a rifle to a potentially violent protest. Obviously looking for trouble.
Oh grat...just wait...the Dumpers are going to parade this murderous kid out as a patriot....shameful
Kyle is a great person...and a great American!
my defense is they chased me I killed them
And I loved "Silver Spoons" as a kid. Screw you, Ricky Schroder.
Ricky Schroeder is garbage and the pillow.man is trash
NOBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CARRIE A ASULT RIFEL FOR NO REASON
The kid is so very innocent. Never should have been locked up in the first place.
defending a murderer to own the libs 😎
I take back everything bad I ever said about former crack addict Mike
His brain got 3 bodies on it,  dammm that’s crazy.
2 million dollars is not bail, that's ransom.
The kid should be given medals.
I hope he gets off
A double murderer at seventeen. This kid is a credit to his race.
Thank God and thank Mr. My  Pillow! Go Kyle, this will all be behind you soon enough!!!
That young thing is gonna love prison. Better teach him how to take it up without screaming.
Really had to add that Mike was a Trump supporter eh?
I don’t agree with the bail system anyways except for those people who are flight risks, so let him be free until his trial.
Did someone spike my drink with hallucinogens ???? My pillow freak , Ricky Schroeder and rogue white wing gun man???? I need to go to bed . WTF????? THE ISLAND OF MISFIT TOYS THESE GUYS!!!
Burn the My Pillows. He would never get my money anyway. His pillows are overpriced $hit.
Yay Schroeder and My Pillow guy!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I love it baby
*Call of Duty Kenosha* Kyle - 3 ANTIFA - 0 Counter Terrorist Win!!!!
Burning my 'My Pillow' as I type this!! 😤😠😡🙅🏾‍♂ He could have donated that money to an organization or people that actually could use it for good.🤦🏾‍♂
GOOD>
Doesn't surprise me they break laws and they are not given time . The corrupt helping the corrupt
Kyle should receive a metal of honor for taking out the liberal trash!
Enjoy the time out before you go to prison.
What a jerk you are Mike Lindell and you Ricky Schroder. This Dumb kid should stay in jail and think about the lives he ruined and the trouble he has caused.
What even is the news anymore?
Kyle Rittenhouse should not have been charged to start with, it was clearly SELF DEFENSE!  God Bless Kyle and his family!
What a couple of patriots!
Due process. Innocent until proven guilty. Speedy trial.
Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero.
So glad this hero was able to post bail.
RedruM
So glad these Americans stood up and helped this Christian boy get bail. This kid deserves freedom not punishment. It was clearly self defense and if the courts find him any other, we are all in trouble. It will send a huge messages to Antifa and BLM”’s terrorists that our country won’t defend innocents but will uphold crime ridden horrible corrupt people like them. President Trump needs to allocate them by executive order as terrorists.
wtfuck?
Waking around with a military style semi automatic machine gun. And he felt HE was acting in self defense....
Rotten Trump loving racist creeps that little SOB will be put back behind bars   Trump Era is doomed
Mike Lindell is disgusting.
He never should have been arrested....
Screw the Leftist
H    E    R    O .  Shot pedos and a felon with a gun.
Innocent until proven guilty.
White privilege ?
Man a lot of people on here supporting a man who abuses women.. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/kyle-rittenhouse-video-kenosha-shooter-punch-girl-a9702206.html
I WILL BE BUYING A PILLOW TODAY.
Just went and purchased bogo @ MY PILLOW JUST because he did this for tue kid defending himself from a known mental patient amd arsonistic looters in Kenosha! Ill always use MY WALETT to support just caises  Dems...if your caose was JUST id have supported you financially as well.. you aint..i dont!
$2,000,000 Dollars
About time.
But wait! There's More!....
I think I will buy a “MyPillow” . Thanks Mike
We all saw the video not self defense these guys are all a bunch of losers!
Self defense? Who in the world is gonna attack a guy with an AR-15 so aggressively that he has to *shoot* them?!
I'm glad he's home! Good for him and his family.
Of course the "My Pillow" guy crawls out from under his rock to bail out this right wing murderer. A pillow is the only meaningful relationship these idiots will ever have.
That's awesome. Mike represents MN well. And God Bless Kyle that was so cool what he did!
They wasted their money.  Let the punk rot in jail.  Hopefully he will rot in prison.  He purchased the gun and couldn't wait to use it.  Period.  Just a punk with a gun thinking life is a video game.
And this is what's wrong with America.
Criminals helping criminals to expand crime
You just going to DOX him like that and think you'll get away with it?
Self-defense, period.  Glad the kid is free for now.
Lmao they bust that boy down
That boy should be facing Death Penalty.That means this system is rigged if they can charge melly with death penalty no parole but not him
boycott my pillow. letting that murder on the street
Glad I never bought one of those pillows now. Pffts.
Amerikkka disgusting👹👺🤢🤢🤮🤮
only in Trumpmerica where they saved a psychopath murderer and domestic terrorist as a hero
Ws support ws no matter what!!!
These wealthy people, full of hatred, like Michael Lindell, are truly dangerous to this country.
Would Kyle be dead had he not shot them?
Guys if you want to buy a My Pillow now, don’t. I got one a while back and it’s nothing like how it is advertised. Also after time it starts becoming worse than a normal pillow.
It was "in self defense....."! The various videos clearly show this! And  what Kyle was doing has been either over looked or misrepresented by the Propagandists. But lets be clear here,  the sort of mayhem that spread across this nation is going to come grinding to a halt,
What a waste of money. He's smiling now but he will inevitably be found guilty of murder x2 & attempted x1 among other charges. His future is not bright, at all. He took two lives, there's no getting around that.
Kyle is a National Treasure 👍🇺🇸
He should have never been in jail. Glad he is out.
Good. Glad the money I donated helped.
LMFAO 🤣 white people are great
that teen is a hero <3 good for him  our system is so shitty we had to spend 2mil to save him , but im happy to hear he's okay, I hope he can get his record clean
Donald Trump should EXONERATE Kyle Rittenhouse !
Sounds about Republican
Totally buying a My pillow now
Innocent.
bUt iT wAs sElF dEfEnSe
A life sentence without bail for weed,but a bail for murder wow.
Jay... that is a lie...even the video shows that,
I donated to this. Awesome
Buying a "My Pillow" tommorow
Brought to you by overpriced, run of the mill pillows.
Mr pillow you,just lost a customer
Awesome! Now when are the charges being filed for the felon with the gun that tried to shoot kyle?! Hes going to have to sign papers with his left hand! Haha
... as a first responder I can say this with all moral centering. He is not one of us. He was brandishing a weapon illegally.   He was declaring himself as a EMT, which he was not. He was hired to do security work that he does not have a license for or training. He is stolen valor in the most dangerous way, one covering himself under false patriotism. He may support the blue/red/white in words but he is not one of us. He does not stand for justice and protection.   The simple fact that he won’t fess up to his actions and hides behind the notion of self defense should be considered an affront to our law systems put in place to protect true victims of violent crimes.   He went to those riots in search of a cause to be a greater man and came back a child begging for protection. Don’t fool yourself into thinking what he did was justified. He had no justification to be in that area. He murdered. Don’t be sheep and follow him. Make America great again and take it back from people that do not know true sacrifice.
Kid took 2 criminals out of society. #Legend
As if michael lindell couldn't get more annoying.
During the Jacob Blake riots*
ILLEGAL CHARGES!!! PLAIN AND SIMPLE!!
But a blk man with a pound of weed gets held without bail. Thats justice for ya!!
Good!!! From the videos I've seen it was self defense
it wont stop him from being put into prison for life
hay MSM go screw youself  this kid is a hero leftys who promote violence FU antifa and BLM your DAY is coming  the thunder is coming and we will bring like you have never seen before trump POTUS
This kid ought to be careful. His victim's family and friends are still out there.
Rittenhouse murdered two people.  I hope that he goes to prison for the rest of his life.  Two people are gone from this life,  family and friends don't get a second chance to be with them.  He does not deserve a second chance.  He made his choice when he bought the illegal gun and showed up on the street that night, all intentions of using that gun.
It was self defense. We can clearly see that! Sky is blue right?
About to go buy me a my pillow!!
I Pray for the boy Kyle Rittenhouse he just defense himself they chase him and shoot him that the reason he has to shoot them back. God Bless Kyle Rittenhouse the American Patriots 👍🙏🏼🇱🇷❤️🙏🏼
oh god i can only imagine the cancel culture seeing this.
Republicans, the party of criminals and murderers. This is crazy.
Those thugs need to die!
It was a accident. He would not have shot anyone if they left the police do their job. Oh that’s right that group wants the ability to attack someone at will. They should thank God that not more people have died.
Kyle is a hero.
So, like Iran, My Pillow is a sponsor of terrorism. Wonder what 45s gonna do. Oh right, he's currently trying to undermine democracy, ans trying to to establish a fascist dictatorship.
Did the Simpsons predict this? My Pillow founder bails out racist killer
He killed 2 people in cold blood... what is so hard for people to get????
I was considering getting a mypillow, now I never will
American ignorance is now shocking
Who’s Mickey Schroeder?
I don’t and would not buy his pillows supporting insane craziness
His bail should have never been so high...
Appalling to see the support this murderer has gotten. It's a sick country we live in.
That's it. I am buying 2 mypillows tomorrow morning.
MAGAQ....... Whatevers Haters. West Coast Support. The World is watching....
MY PILLOW FTW! Super Patriot.  While Bloomberg bails out criminals and thugs for votes, a great American (Mike Lindell) helps out a young American in need. I see some new pillows in my future
Kyle the Killer gets out... well .. well.. the demons help the demons.. self defense means he drove to another town with a gun while wearing gloves so he could defend his self ...sounds just a little stupid to me.. That case sounds lost before it got started...
Good
Anyone who donated belongs on a watch list
he litterally KILLED TWO! PEOPLEEE
This is amazing!!!
this kid should still be in jail.   he is a danger to all of us.  Guess Ricky never tires of being a bad actor!
You're my hero
just ordered a couple pillows. Thanks Mr. Lindell for not letting this kid rot in jail for defending himself!!!
Remember during the Kenosha riots that picture of the sign had Black lives matter on it and there was a fire in the background lol
So what the moment he Jay walks he gets arrested again?
Wow sad so sad liars DONT BUY PILLOWS FROM THIS LIAR HELPING TRUMP CONDONE SIN GOD WILL HAVE HIS DAY!
Celebrating a killer, wow!
This why nobody ever liked MyPillow. #tempurpedicgang
Disgusting
Amen
Thank you Kyle for showing us how to protect ourselves from these evil minions
Revelation 3:19  As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. Jesus is coming, he is willing to accept anyone who have faith and trust in Lord god. He loved you so much he prove it on the cross. Please repent and love others just the way Jesus loves you. God bless you all!Have a wonderful day.
The real shame is it took a 17 year old, to do what adult men and women wouldn't do to defend their local businesses and help to keep the peace. America has fallen so far since the 1900's. Instead of coming together we let the media and corrupt politicians tell us what to think and how we should feel about everything going on. That somehow in 2020 we are a country full of racists or at least that's what they want you all to believe. We used to be a country that based your standing in society by your actions, your qualities, your knowledge and experience. Now we are told to clear the way for those that didn't put in the work because life has to be fair. News flash, life isn't fair, it is up to all of us to make this country a place worth living in and to protect those rights that our forefathers fought so hard for, the same country that Martin Luther King Jr. wanted for his son's and daughters. Its not us dividing this country folks but it is on us to defend it from tyrannical politicians and the swamp or forever be remembered as the generation of Americans that let the greatest country to ever exist be destroyed by hate and greed. Your choice. We all need to follow the elections extremely close, we are being taken for fools by the Democrat Party.
Because of Michael Lindell's actions we ordered 4 pillows yesterday from My Pillow.
LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP!
If anyone bought mypillow, yall better get a refund ASAP if you dont support what he did.
Schroder?
The need more sales 😂😂
Is this the same kid that purchased an AR illegally and crossed state lines...then later to claim self defense??
I'm not big on cancel culture, but I plan on NEVER buying a Mypillow again
NBC actually recreated the events in it's entirety and posted it. Analysing every aspect from each piece of video. If it were presented in court it would have exonerated him completely.  IRONICALLY, it disappeared within hours. Someone at NBC did their job and then corporate called and shut then down. Media corruption is the real enemy
That guy has a million commercials. I had no idea they were Nazi commercials
He will still go to jail.
Yes, let this juvenile run free again.
just sold 70 million pillows
Good I'm glad. Totally justified
Must have killed NBC to have to report that a Patriot was let out of jail.
This is disgusting, It’s basically approving of murder. How many cheesy pillows do you have to sell to approve of murder?
Outright murderer. He left his home state, crossed state lines armed, found unarmed ppl and shot them dead. Do u know their names? Nope. This sh*t got what he wanted...name in the news and Mr. Pillow guy and Trumps friend, helped him back out on the streets. Ricki (has been) still has some cash and got his name in the news. Everyone’s all smiles with two left to bleed out on a street.
Kind of glad he’s out , at this age with that attitude and no gun , doubt he’s gonna last long out there
OMG! He looks so much like Adam Lanza! There shouldn't be any bail in a murder case. Just saying.
Media making a teen look like a mass murderer when he was violently attacked while going there to offer aid and to protect businesses.
The 17 yr old should never have had a gun and should never have been there ... self defense is 'minding your own business'
The comments here are a reflection of just how poorly informed those on the political left truly are. Rittenhouse fled, he did not seek out an altercation. That was forced upon him by a rioting mob who discharged weapons as they pursued him, specifically for the purpose of causing severe bodily injury or death. He fired in response to the discharge of weapons by his assailants... that's multiple, since you democrats don't read, all that well. He fled again and was pursued again by a rioting mob with the intent of causing severe bodily harm and probably death. This time they got their hands on him leaving him no alternative but to defend himself. The pursuit began because Rittenhouse put out a fire started on a small business by a felonious rioter. This is an open and shut case of self defense. Democrats stupidity defund the police, against the will of 81% of people who actually live in black communities, claiming they can police themselves. Kyle Rittenhouse polices himself, democrats cry. The political left in the United States is a joke... a very dangerous joke
sh!t bags supporting sh!t bags.
This Lowlife should get life & no bail, if he were African American he would be in jail forever, the Hypocrites that support him should also be in jail, he killed 2 people! What was he doing at a protest with a automatic weapon where tensions are already high & not even in his own state.
Justice scented pillows coming soon to you.
Next time shoot someone on 5th ave. Michael Lindell will set U free!
love racist murders woo MAGA!!!!
It’s all political. He’ll have his charges reduced, if not thrown out all together, if he has a half decent attorney. Key point of all of this... he shot AFTER he began getting beaten. Classic self defense. The real criminals are the ones who had the balls, and lack of sense to attack someone with a rifle!
That is disgusting that those people supported this murderous teen! I'm never buying one of this stupid pillows!
Amen.  God bless man THANK GOD HE HAD A GUN TO DEFEND HIMSELF
Free Kyle!
Off with the media
Good job kyle
Assisted suicide.
In Wisconsin he will be innocence. Sorry but this state privilege is too strong.
This news story is actually labelling these people & company to be cancelled by reporting this. Yet somehow they never reported who kept posting bail for those antifa members or supplying them with truckloads of rioting supplies. Biased news is so irritating.
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP PUTTING THIS KID IN THE MIDDLE OF POLITICAL TERMOIL. WHAT HAPPENED WAS A TRRAGEDY ON ALL SIDES AND HE IS NIETHER A HERO OR A MONSTER, HE IS A KID THAT SHOULD NEVER OF HAD THE GUN BUT HAD GOOD INTENTIONS AND IN NO WAY WENT THERE TO HARM SOMEONE. I FEAR THAT AS THE LEFT SEE HIM AS A MONSTER AND THE RACIST SIDE OF THE RIGHT PROP HIM UP A VIGILANTE AND RADICILIZE HIM; WHEN HE IS NOT LIKE THAT, THAT HE WILL BECOME WHAT HE IS BEING LABELED AS. KEEP THE POLITICS OUT OF IT, HE HAS A GOOD CASE FOR SELF DEFENSE AND THE PROSECUTOR CAN SAY HE HAD A GUN UNLAWFULLY WHICH IS A FELONY AND IT RESULTED IN DEATHS, SO INVOULTARY MANSLUAGHTER. WE NEED TO STAY OUT OF IT AND LET THE JURRY FIGURE IT OUT.
kid is going to learn the wrong lesson from this ordeal
PPPPPPPrivilege much
I was in the middle of starting a fundraiser for this kid.   I'm glad somebody with the funds stepped up and got him free. 🙏
Thank you Mike, we love you....
Amen to this I'm glad to hear it, he only shot them in self defense look at the video every person he shot attacked him while he was running to the police besides the first guy he shot him while trying to get away from him because the guy was attacking him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fylHh64W-i8 go to around 20 min in that is when they show the footage.  Kyle was there in the first place as a paid gourd and was giving many people most of which were the rioters first aid.
He was acting in self defense!
Ricky Schroeder can’t even get top billing on a bailout. Time is cruel.
Thank God they let him go he needs to be free
The Kenosha DA is a rat, and a disgrace to humanity.  I didn’t vote for the bum, and he was the only one on the ballot.  Pure evil in Kenosha.
I would never buy another pillow from that man's company. I wish I would've googled him b4 purchasing my pillow. Just bc he's a FKN CLOWN TRAITOR SUPPORTER
According to the law he's innocent uneducated people in the comment section I'm observing
Yes
I see what your doing Ricky. Your trying to get your spot on celebrity apprentice. You can’t fool me.
How can you be charged with homicide when you were engaging in self defense? Kyle probably would have been brutally beaten or murdered had he not been armed
Jangle Leg will be patiently waiting for her return...Loose like a goose.
Hello this kid crossed state lines to put himself in danger! His dad should be charged too since he knew about the weapon! All of these people are sycophants!
I'm starting to see what the alt-right means by fake news. While there was nothing false in this report, it was definitely slanted against Kyle. It was in no way balanced. Yes, show pictures of him with his gun but also pictures of him providing medical aid to protesters, or pictures of him putting out fires set by rioters or maybe pictures of him being attacked by a skateboard wielding misfit. The story is much more nuanced than a kid who shot two people but _claimed_ self defense/ To be fair, most stories are but with the amount of photographic evidence available for this case, there are at least a few other pics that could have been selected to balance the narrative more.
Mike must be back on the crack
Video clearly shows that Kyle Rittenhouse killed in self defense. Video clearly shows Joe Biden groping  children.  Believe your eyes instead of media lies.
Doesn't matter you don't get to play God even with all this happening God is going to have the last say so and I bet he will get haunted for the rest of his life. He's a murderer a cold-blooded murderer and it's disgusting how humans can applaud this pathetic just like their lost souls.
Ricky Schroder is a woman beater and a racist.
i think i need a new pillow!
Kyle about to go Antifa hunting
This game is P2W.
If Kyle was black he would've been shot on spot
Going to buy a My Pillow now
Video shows Kyle Rittenhouse clearly killed in self defense. Video shows Joe Biden clearly groped children.  Believe your eyes instead of media lies.
It's amazing how little the commenters on here actually know about this case.
good
He did that poor junkie a favor, lifetime of struggles with drugs, beating women.
Finally
HOPE ❤️, Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 📖nkjv ✝️🇺🇸🙏💫✨❤️
it was ridiculously high bail
Just think.. right now decent folks are breathing up all the oxygen that god put here for the liberals
What message does that send to school potential mass shooters? When money is the factor of staying in jail or not, corruption becomes the norm.If you do the crime you do the time.Not do the time and with some cash you can go out.
Temporary.  Hes still going to prison. Not sure what he's smiling about.
Jesus is coming
Looks like he got a lifetime supply of Black Rifle coffee.
Local hero bailed out by American businessmen.
Lindell has so much COKE  up his nose he dont know where he is most of the time  !!!
DISGUSTING RACIST POS
So what, you had demoncrat Congress and demoncrat senators and celebrities, athletes putting up bail for antfa and BLM terrorist.
Sellout  https://www.facebook.com/jesse.adams.182940  Thee Anti Christ  Edit... LOL Cell out
Soooooo happy for Kyle and his family!!!!!! 👍☺
He was acting in self defense and all the videos and photos are out there to prove it.  Good for you Kyle and I hear Lin Wood will represent you...I hope so.  God bless you Kyle.
These men are fools to let the kid get out of jail. His mom ought to be in jail as well.
Dudes a HERO he killed a liberal and a child molester
Disgusting action by Schroder.
Good for him. Go Kyle!
They defend him (despite the fact that he illegally had possession of a firearm and underage),...but they are quick to call Trayvon Martin a "thug" for defending himself without a gun.
Black people dont get bails
Wr
That's one pillow I will not be using.
BOYCOTT MY PILLOW
Never buying a "My pillow" now.
YESSS
I'm going to buy so many mypillow pillows because of this. Michael Lindell wow. It's great to know that people with a lot of money would just bail out a young kid was just defending himself. Granted he shouldn't have really gone there in my opinion but self defense is self defense. I hope he gave him a few mypillows too lol
That's my murdering teen👍
Guaranteed the best sleep of your life
Wtf Ricky Schroeder????
WOW...right on Michael lindell.. Kyle doesn't belong in jail for defending himself
"claims he was acting in self-defense..."? really? anyone who has seen the footage KNOWS it was self-defense.
Bravo God bless these American Patriots.  By the way, anyone here have good experience with My Pillow?  I was considering buying one,however, none of my family or friends have one. Trying to find relief for stiff neck and shoulders.  Thank you.☺
Murder suspects should not get bail... especially a double murder and an attempt of murder and maiming in the same night
Its good to be white. Nothing is illegal, if you can afford it. ....the new golden rule....those with gold make all the rules.
N Scott Baio I hear too
💚
Never buy a My Pillow!!! This is a disgrace!
Lmao !!! That's hilarious
SOMEONE FIND HIM!!!!!!
🥳🥳🥳
he should still be in Jail NO BOND. He murdered them!!!!
Rittenhouse was the mastermind of the show Timeless. Is this a coincidence? I think not. I think we're dealing with a time traveler here!
As Gollum says... Murrrdeeereeer
Awesome 👌...  He doesn't claim that it was self defence we all saw the video, it was nothing but self defence.
This kids LIFE WAS THREATENED. GOOD FOR HIM AND GOD BLESS
Self defense! Watch video fools
White ppl bruh SMH
EPIC
Did Rick bring the Silver Spoon too?
Self defense?   Dude wasn't at home...he travelled across state line with a gun and intentions...in his head he was prob thinking " i wish you would.." lol
Hope he's found innocent
Was clearly self defense. Everyone got what they deserved. Kyle should be a free man
Yeah.. BLM can loot, put officers in the hospital, burn buildings, assault pedestrians and passerbys and they don't even get so much as a parking ticket. This kid defends himself against thugs and gets slammed with a 2 million dollar bail. No bias at all.
As an aside, I thought the My Pillow guy was stupid before. I have not changed my opinion !!!!!!!
Kyle is a straight up murderer. He should get life in prison and so should his mother.
last time i buy any more pillows from mike.  mike mr. religion.  what a joke!!
Two Million Bail , Really , Some judge needs to be in jail.
It's absolutely sickening that people are glorifying this POS.
Glad Kyle finally got out.  #Kyle'sFree
I don't know what this pillow is, I do want one. For free. And I know from getting a ridge wallet, someone in here will randomly offer to buy me one because they do want to contribute.   Buy me the pillow, random generous person!!
wars comin ladies... or thats encouragement to respond to the left wing war thats already being waged rather... and when ya lose you should know there not a country on earth thats gonna take ya in...
Buying my pillow as Christmas presents for everyone I know.
Here's to hoping some good ol' street justice happens to that murderer.
Dude killed two people and those three are smiling.  Something is very wrong with that.
Evil
I wish he would have shot more DBAG lefty communists! All communists in America need to be deported or "Rittenhoused"
Justice for kyle!
He is a MURDERER cop wannabee!!! Put that on his RESUME !!!!!!!!!!
I thought they decided to not press charges awhile back. I'm confused. Just looked it up, apparently the dropped charges was a false report.
Defund Gun Control
American Hero
HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!
He might have been safer in jail.
Awesome! Ricky Schroeder?!!
The boy was there to help and defended himself from evil.🇺🇸
There you go folks you know what not to buy.
I'm buying a pillow!
So, let me get this straight. Your psychotic a&%% drove hundreds of miles with a gun to confront protesters just so you can defend yourself? Got it.
It was self-defense clear as day. The guy with the skateboard could have killed him
He shouldn't have even been there. What mom drives a kid across state lines to be a "medic" and protect businesses during a riot.  What I'm surprised by is before the shootings he was talking with the cops brandishing his AR. He looks like a baby, the cops should have asked him to see his ID to make sure he's old enough. To sum it all up, every single person there screwed up, or didn't do their job. What good came out of the situation, nothing. Everyone who was there is to blame for this. Also, leave it up to the crack head to bail him out. You can't make this stuff up. I hope 2021 will be better than the sh** show of 2020.
Ah yes, Republicans embracing domestic terrorists.
Good for him. This is one of the most ridiculous cases I’ve ever seen.
The Orange clown that he worships, wouldn't do it! WTF? Ricky Schroeder, worships the orange clown too? Figures! He needs to get attention from somewhere I guess!
Now that is one well trained young man taking out communist. Marine corpse needs to recruit that young man!
Hero
What? Am I on acid?
I have not seen a video or photo of this guy that would indicate an IQ above 50.
Kyle "The Kenosha Kid" Rittenhouse is an American hero.
Pillows sell with certain demographics. Hint, hint, they cut holes in them to see the tiki torch!
Murderers as heroes. Thats where we're at.
Be very careful opening that medicine cabinet..
Enjoy your time in prison
#Schroeder2024
I’m surprised it took this long for him to make bail
0:12  = unnecessary anchor comment and clearly trump hate propaganda.
Looks like I'm buying a my pillow
That is one of the pillows NOT to buy.
Good 👏🏼
Guess I know where I'll be buying my next pillow.
i stand with kyle.
Kyle and Trump gonna win
Does anyone actually know the story? Kyle was viciously attacked go ahead and check.
I wonder how the families of the people he killed are holding up
You do have the right to defend yourself, quit attacking innocent people, and things will get better.  It's common sense, which is in diar straights, everyone take a step back.
Lunatic psycho Kyle thinks he is Rambo. He is a walking time bomb. What a farce that these stupid people paid 2 million for psycho Kyle's bail that could have gone to starving people instead.
Kyle is an American Patriot.
America is a pathetic nation....
I feel like the courts know he's going to walk, but still place high charges on him and gave him a bail knowing something like this would happen. After all 2 million dollars really isn't bad, depending on what you're doing.
Self defense
This is totally bull crap
He’s going right back !
RottenHouse
Good it was all self defense he is just a kid facing off thugs
He should have never went to jail in the first place.  He smoked a pedophile antifa piece of trash.  Rittenhouse is an American hero.
Well he was acting in self defense so...
Free at last, free at last.
This is news worthy?
May no one ever buy a my pillow again.  May Schroeder never act again a day of his life.
Antifa is fighting the wrong fascist.
my pillow cures cancer. mike said so :D
Kyle rittenhouse was defending himself, he shouldn’t of been arrested in the first place! Much respect to the men who helped secure this young mans release, DROP ALL CHARGES IMMEDIATELY!!
Wow
This pillow guy. Lol I mean wow.
helping a psycho...and smiling , so fkd up
That’s a odd store
The charges should be dropped, they are absurd.
He better enjoy his freedom while it lasts. Soon the only view he'll get of the outside world will be through a fence and a tv.
I guess this would be NO different than any other suspected "murderer" posting bail (as your headline reads). One was just released with $2M bail a couple of days ago. Maybe focus on something better.... ???
Everyone who bought a my pillow just slapped his own forehead for helping bail this little POS out.
Murderer
That kid was much safer behind those bars lmao poor kid 😂
Gross. Disgusting people.
Now can we raise funds for a statue of our hero please?
the kid is treated like a hero cuz if democrat  can treat atifa like heros of the usa so we can to its not only democrat  that can
He single handedly stopped that stupid riot.
You are all sick!!!!!!!!!
Self-defense.
paying bail for an obvious murderer, doesn't that tell you all you need to know about Trump and the fascist right in America?
I'm just sorry Schroeder doesn't have a show for me to boycott, lol. they only have has-beens and crazies
The kid is a murderer. I hope he ends up in club fed with Trump.
Thank you Mike and Ricky!
Thank you Mike and Ricky !
Self defense all the way why would chase an armed person.
Now I gotta get me some My Pillows.
Gross, absolutely gross.
Taught some libs the meaning of self defense.
The one punk that chased him with a pistol and was shot in the arm was a felon, was he charged with being a felon with a firearm? Would his bail be $2,000,000.00 This kid better walk.
Kyle is A man who had his life destroyed by the media. He was there to keep the peace. All day long before the incident he cleaned up vandalize buildings, and only shot when he was threatened.
Great marketing from Black rifle.
What a psycho.
Hope black people noticing how yt’s stick together when they people treated unfairly
Good! All the Antifa and BLM rioters got off and never even tried so... only fitting since he was doing the police and state officials jobs
Man killed 2 people and walked free that’s crazy
I have to buy another my pillow! But they really last forever
Excellent Kyle, its about time 👏👏👏👏👏👏
If he were black...
Partisan thinking and disinformation have reached dangerous levels in this country. Kid was somewhere he was not supposed to be with a weapon he was not allowed to have, then killed two people. And now these men and others treat him like a hero.
Put him away for life
He will get what he deserves, just got bail because he's white and t rump delusioned.....maga magic. The eyes that can not see, are sad.
Kyle R is a hero. Cleans up vandelized buildings during the day, and takes out domestic terrorist at night!
Based Kyle did nothing wrong.
This is messed up. The people he killed were unarmed. He had no business going there.
Boycott  Sellers of My Pillow
Good for him, obviously self defense.
Yeah I know DUMPY has 3 sons. You clowns should be his 4th or 5th you jokers are MORONS. Rittenhouse is a Real American RIGHT! So he would be DUMPY's son. Clowns to the left of me Jokers to right or ON THE RIGHT. lol.... unbelieveable.
It’s disgusting that a murderer like him can just walk among us like he’s done nothing wrong
He drove how many miles across the state line just to "defend" himself? NOT!  He drove many miles across the state line to commit first degree premeditated homicide, FACT!!!!!
I'll never buy or own any of his products, the kids a punk hope he gets life. Black lives matter, more than his.
Looks like the media stopped calling him white supremacist since Lin Wood represents Kyle now. Guess they did learn after paying millions to Sandmann.
To understand how stupid liberals are, is to chase a guy with a gun, any type of gun down the street armed only with skateboards, tennis shoes or a filthy mouth is beyond comprehension.
Anyone that watched the video would also claim he acted in self defense.
GOOD!  A true patriot and hero deserves to be FREE!
Poor kid he made a bad decision! And I am sure that the time he did woke him up! I am not saying he did anything wrong! He just had a bad string of luck! And he was in the wrong state!! He was clearly attached and I would of done the same thing! But I live in Florida! He had to make a split minute decision and he will have to pay for the rest of his life!!
this is epic
Crazypeople
Blow me TODAY. Pozers!!!
He claims self defense...it was self defense...anyone with a brain can watch the videos and see
Disgusting, boycott Ricky Schroder and boycott my pillow guy ,
This is Disgusting! To add insult to injury the families had to bury their children and family. Why not give to that?  I was actually just getting ready to purchase a pillow from this guys company this week and seen this today. I’ll speaks my money elsewhere, sad and disgusting. Why mention the presidents name in it? Political
Phew! Happy Thanksgiving 🦃🍽🍁 !!!!!
Good luck Kyle  total self defences buying new pillows tomorrow from Mike not amazon Washington Post
2 million dollar bail is ridiculous. Glads he out though and looking forward to his acquittal.
this snotty little turd should be in jail for life for murdering 2 people
Godspeed Kyle - Hope you have a wonderful time with your family this Thanksgiving.
His parents should go to
Supporters of a killer.... go figure..
Why is this lunatic out? Why is the pillow guy bailing out a criminal that committed a crime deserving of life in prison? And why are people praising these knuckleheads? This is very disturbing to me and many folks out there that believe he’s criminal 😣
The amount of bots posting radical comments on Youtube is disturbing
Good!,but we will never hear the end of this one.
Killers out? Whats new we all suspected this.
lol he takes a gun that's not his under age kills someone and they let him out lol
A freakin pillow guy pays bail for a kid who not only was in illegal possession of a weapon, had no real reason to be out in the middle of the riots except “wanting to help” with an AR-15 and kills 2 people. What’s the point of any gun law if you can just break them and have people post bail for you?
Al Capone
Nice to find out the kid from Silver Spoons is a dirtbag....  Already knew that about the My Pillow guy.
This kid should be let off 100% with no charges.  The thugs who were looting rioting (democrats) should be in jail and have to pay restitution for all of the damages they caused.
This kid should be let off 100% with no charges.  The thugs who were looting rioting (democrats) should be in jail and have to pay restitution for all of the damages they caused.
Kyle is completely innocent.  He merely engaged in self defense.  I am so glad to see that he was able to post bail that I am going to buy some of Mike's pillows just to show support!
Kyle will be servicing alot of male pillows before turning 21...
No surprises here.   Schroeder is a known spouse abuser  Lindell is a dickhead  Riittenhouse is a wanna be mercenary and is an actual murderer  Trump supporters in a nutshell
I see what you did there just post his address why don't you
Isn't it weird that Democrats actually release convicted murderers but make it big news that the kid who defended himself is out on bail for 2 million?
BRCC not really sure what to do about that 🤐
2020 is wild
He is innocent he killed a pedophile and a thug. He didn't land on planet Rock and The Rock landed on him
He is innocent
Notice how he says "He claims he was acting... pause... in self defense.."  No bias though right boys?
Boycott my pillow and anything attached to Mr Schroder
So, an illegal age guy who is not even from the state murders people with help from an adult. That sounds fantastic to everyone else to follow as an example. Republicans and whites are like, we can bend the rules a little-as long as it benefits a certain type of group. On the other hand fed up BLM destroy property, they say, “the deserve a bullet or life in prison”. One day many more will say enough!!!
Im going to go buy some My Pillows now.
It's self defense.
Kenosha Hero* Not a murderer!
I wish I could have donated! He’s a national hero! #CommunistsArentPeople
What happened to the word usually used "alleged". Oh that's only about stories with liberals and democrats
That’s disgusting.
So just thinking out loud  If Rittenhouse goes free, does that mean we all can protest with AR's and shoot anyone who touches you...🤔🤔  This will be like a Mass shooting but  1 person only gets to shoot 2 people.
and old lindell is a christen..more like a Satan worshiper
God Bless ya Ricky
Videos do seem to prove that he was acting in self defense. Seems like a really good kid all in all. Hope him a happy Xgiving =)
Michael Lindell and Ricky Schroder, what awesome guys.  KUDOS.
WITH A BLACK RIFLE SHIRT,  OH AMERICA, OH THE IRONY
The fact that he doesnt live in Wisconsin, with a rifle in his hands, is enough for me to reach a guilty verdict if I was a juror. Clearly out looking for trouble that night.   At 17, I'd rather not go somewhere where I'd have to fire rounds at a crowd, let alone, bring my own rifle there across state lines. Psychopath
Basically when you open carry if anyone is even remotely aggressive towards you then "self defense" is justified.
You mean help from threw pillow biter
So silver spoon and the cheap pillow guy are bailing out a murderer. SMDH.
The set bail amount is ridiculous...
Do people actually think this guy is a hero? He literally took the law into his own hands while breaking the law. He also obtained the firearm illegally this makes lawful gun owners look bad
Yeah ok, New York stands with you Kyle and for My Man, Mike God stand with you beside you. “Silver Spoons” actor Ricky Schroder. God hears you from above...
RS - "It's RICK, RICK Schroder!"
They all  should be turned to the family of the people he murder..
But all the rioters get let go free? And a guy trying to defend himself gets charged and jailed? Wow since when is defending yourself against criminals a crime?
I don't know enough about the facts of the case, and refuse to be influenced by Today or CNN, but in today's climate you can be assured he won't get a fair trial, as CNN has him convicted already.   CNN seems to be the new sheriff, judge and jury these days and no longer an outlet for people to get the news of the day.  I believe Biden will be putting CNN in his cabinet for that new position of Secretary of Truth (doublespeak for minister of propaganda).
Ricky from silver spoons and that pillow dude are supporting a white racist white nationalist and a murderer! If only us black ppl could stick together like them!!
as he should
We’ll that’s one way to ruin ur business smh 🤦‍♂️ he should’ve set something up to do it anonymously
The fact that he was charged when there is video proof of self defense is a violation of his liberty. I hope he files a laws suit before the trial even starts. All media that reported his name before an arrest was made is also culpable in this suit.
folks truly live in an alternate reality..just creating their own storylines that fit their own narrative.. facts are just annoyances that need to be avoided with these fake patriots
What happen to all the people thought OJ was guilty?.
Welp....no more "My Pillows" for me.
Poor Ricky hasn't been in front of a camera in over 5 years.. he was craving attention
If he was antifa, it never would have made the news.
WTF would you support a murderer??? You know the kid is a liar... he killed those people.
Man, I heard MyPillow ain't even good (pillow quality) If you got the money, get a purple pillow. Their harmony pillow is excellent
R u effing serious wowzers
Bro someone try to jump me I’m blastin
Home for the HOLIDAYS...GOD BLESS!!!
BOYCOTT MY PILLOW GUY!!!😡😷🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I bought the My Pillow & didn't give me a good night sleep so I gave it to my brother. He didn't like it either & threw it away. What a waste of money.
Thanks Mike.
Does he have money for security too?
Proud boys take care of proud boys 🤔 By  getting celebrities to bail you out when you just a regular person doesn't mean anything.. Don't get comfortable because you going  right right back...
Media and Prosecutor Office: "Only the video showing Kyle shooting two men means ANYTHING.... NOT the video showing Kyle being brutally attacked, and NOT the video which shows the WORLD (Those with eyes to see), that Kyle was DEFENDING HIS' LIFE   Wisconsin Prosecutor, Were you required to study the U.S. Bill of Rights ?  Prosecutor, You are weak minded, if you are a guy, grow a set. If you are a woman, borrow some common sense.   Kyle, AMERICANS have your back, Kiddo. We are with you.  Fellow Statesman.
Soon you will be right back behind bars
Ricky Schroeder, my man! Love actors that have the balls to go against the grain.
Kid with a bad record, crossing state lines, looking to hurt someone... If he was black, you'd call him a monster, villainize him.  This kid is an insecure punk, a garbage human being. This is a real thug and he deserves to be locked up.
Never would've bought that pillow til now.
Christens huh
wtf?
Does anyone know where Kyle lives?   I want to go to his town to practice my self defense
now the Liberals hate Ricky Schroder lol
"Murder suspect" give me a break...
🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽
More good news for you 4 supreme Court Justice so one in Pennsylvania one in Michigan one in Georgia one in Wisconsin I'll tell you what I'll save you the trouble of calling me a liar go ahead and Google it to find out which for Lucky judges get to decide each state and the other thing you should notice is it won't be buried in Google anymore it'll be the first one use this supreme court justices to take over circuit courts you'll love the list of names can you say illegitimate no more
Cool! One more "Political Prisoner" released from jail. He should be pardoned altogether by trump before he leaves office. Sadly he didn't take out more ANTIFA terrorists.
Numerous charges? You mean self defense...?
look he's famous now. wow... a real republican hero... a murderer...
Disgusting. America has really went into the toilet. I see it collapsing in a few years.
This is disgusting.  My best guess is this is some type of publicity for the my pillow guy and silver spoons dude.  That kid is going to jail for manslaughter.  Worse case scenario is he jumps bail and is on the run, which would also be best case, too, as those two are out $2 million dollars.
This is the clearest case of self-defense ever, anyone who watches the video without an agenda can see it.
Patriot.
scumbucket fascists reactionary Trumpsters.
The comments here are so heavily censored that I have no idea what people are replying to each other about no matter how many I read in a thread.
That bail amount is a headscratcher. Wtf was the judge thinking?
Disgusting. Mjurderer Rittenour should never smile another day in his life and I hope Schroder and Lindell lose everything.
I think you mean riots not protest
This just proves how corrupt America really is. One can get away with murder just because they support the Government
alright then...im going to go an buy a gun...just to target whites....let's get thousands of others to do the same thing....see how this gets played out....
good, Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong
Buying a my pillow tomorrow.
This is America.
What does 'trump supporter" have anything to do with this???! Why not talk about how Kyle was defending himself from antifa?
You two are truly blessed  thank you for COMMING forward to help him he is just a child and they want to usa him for an example of there twisted way of seeing things he was acting in self defense . in  the video it shows  them attacking  him it's ok for them to attack riot set fires but we as the working people can't defend ourself  would it have been different had they killed him that's what they were doing to people
I just threw out my pillow.
LIBERALS GO REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Everyone knows he's guilty. They have him on video. And you only get your bail back if you aren't. So, guess Pillow Dude and Ricky Schroeder are out $2M
You can't buy a clean conscience
These are not claims. He acted in self defense. It's all on tape!
god bless america
How can I get a corporate sponsorship after killing 2 people? I didn't think Cyberpunk: 2077 came out until next month...?
A freed patriot!!
This world had gone to utter $hi@ while under the so called presidency of Trump. The time for a new president can't come fast enough.
The former crack addict born again Christian using his money to bail out a killer.  The battle between good and evil must raging in Mike Lindell.  I can see My Pillow products being pulled off the shelves with major retailers.  I doubt consumers would buy from a CEO/owner who uses his profits to promote murder.
Is this the new 3 stooges???? Pillow fight!!!!
Good for him. It looked like self defense to me from a guy that’s taken self defense classes.
If I could pee on a MyPillow right now, I would.
Can you imagine how different this story would've been if he didn't enter a crowd of people with a military grade weapon, and an itchy trigger finger?
Thought I was reading the title wrong
I don't see the point of publicizing where his money came from to post bail. The kid didn't do anything wrong and the people helping him are only being named so they can be added to a black list. This is American media... subtly telling you how to think without you even realizing it. It's not new, they've been doing this stuff since the 60s.
Also, I think I need a new Pillow now.
Hope they have more to bail tRump out! Lol so f..... funny
Ricky Schroder, Jon Voight....who next are the Trump cultists/The Champ casts members? Faye Dunaway too??
Awesome. I am glad he made bail.  Best of luck to you bud.
America going down the tubes!! This case is indicative of how messed up the US has become.
and to think I was just going to purchase an entire household of pillows from this guy smh. Oh the racist world we live in
If an individual is attacked by a mob I support that person's right to defend themselves. However, I can't condone an individual inserting themselves as a vigilante. The outcome of this situation being my case and point.
KALIEF BROWDER. Rest Easy!
A+ Kyle defended himself
Wow just effing wow
A hero
#RittenhouseStrong  Congrats, Kyle!
Goal: He think he will help people and self-defend  Fact: He killed two people, and injure some people --- We need to know how to be a good person ---
If the so-called protestors didn't riot and loot businesses, he would've not gone on duty to guard a local business. If they never acted aggressively towards Kyle, he wouldn't have shot them. Kyle is innocent in front of the eyes of the people who can think rationally.
I'm confused... how can someone who kills another person even be offered bail?
So glad I never bought that pillow!!!
They let a murderer go free?
White Supremacists always look out for fellow White Supremacists.
YEAHHHHHHH!!    SELF DEFENSE IS SELF DEFENSE....WHY DOES THE LAW ONLY APPLY WHEN IT FITS SOMEBODYS NARRATIVE!! SUCKS!!
Posing with a murderer, wow!!!
200k to get this worthless POS kid out of jail? Pathetic, he belongs in there, murderer
My pillow? More like mein kampf
To be clear, no black people were involved in this entire situation.  ONLY WHITE PEOPLE.  Claiming this kid did anything racist is ABSURD and ill informed.
guess who im NOT buying from ever? I'm going to buy a pillow thats from a real person, not some terrorist bailout pillow factory maker.
Aren't liberals opposed to people having to pay bail in the first place?
Consumers: Boycott the purchase of "My Pillow" after the president of the company, Mike Lindell,  sponsored the release of Kyle Rittenhouse on bail. There is a 2 year old  little girl that will never know the love of her father because this white supremacist shooting him in Kenosha, during a peaceful protest there.
That is a *CHILD.* Crazy how folks are condoning what he did. All of this is *SICK!* smfh
How is a murderer given bail. Such a blatant example of the rich getting away with anything. I hope they charge the boy as an adult and give him at least two consecutive life terms. He went there with the intent to harm. Underage and armed. His accomplice who bought his weapons should be given the same sentence. How twisted these people are.
I never thought I'd buy a MyPillow. But when I saw the generosity of Mike Lindell, I ordered 2 of his pillows.
And he’s wearing a shirt that says black rifle on it! Are you f@&cking kidding me! Also where in 2020 did the my pillow guy become more popular than his trash pillow? Wears my speed pass to 2021?
So glad that so many patriots helped bail this kid out of jail. These charges are absolute BS and purely politically motivated. Those morons in Kenosha allowed people to burn, loot, and riot, causing millions of dollars in damage, over 90% of which is not being covered by insurance, and ruining many lives. Meanwhile, they decide that when people have to defend things themselves and act in self-defense, that it deserves 1st degree homicide charges. This is a travesty and a ridiculous infringement of rights. I really hope that the justice system works properly and Kyle is found "not-guilty" on these stupid charges.
The definition of being a WHITE MALE IN AMERICA.  edited: I stand corrected, after looking into Kyle Rittenhouse case. He is innocent and uses the weapon for self defense.  I was incorrect.
he did what any american in that situation would do
On the fact alone he killed a pos convicted of raping multiple little boys and killed a pos who was a woman beater should be enough to let him walk free.  Some things the media missed as well...the day before he volunteered his time to remove graffiti off a local business that the peaceful protesters tagged up. They missed the video of him announcing to the crowd he is there to provide medical treatment regardless of who it was or the video of him running with a fire extinguisher after a burning dumpster that was to be pushed at a gas station.  Here's a couple more facts...regardless of the wrongs he did (no a 17 year old shouldn't be running around with any firearm and no he shouldn't have crossed state lines) this KID showed more balls than most MEN and more kids his age should aim to do the positive things kyle has rather than eating tide pods, experimenting with drugs or melting their brains with video games.   Maybe if there were a few more patriots willing to stand up against the people who are actively destroying our country and way of life then maybe these spineless antifa members would think twice about how they spread their message. Maybe if the police did their job, the job they signed up for, protests wouldn't turn to riots. Maybe if the propaganda machine was checked they wouldn't continue to brainwash the public. Maybe if politicians kept their word. Maybe if alot of Americans FINALLY STOOD UP and stopped all these maybes, without fear of being labeled a racist, bigot, etc then the American people could begin healing...start to realize we can coexist regardless of our views, call each other brother and sister, lend a helping hand to those that need it most. If the bulk of us came together we could stop this oppressive machine that had encouraged hate and divided us. All it takes is one small spark to start the fire that could cleanse this beautiful country of ours of all that is corrupt and evil. It is the DUTY of the AMERICAN PEOPLES to eradicate that and those who would take our God given rights of LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS   God bless all my true patriots, all my brothers and sisters out there who are ready to die on their feet rather than live on their knees. When the time comes ill be ready to join the rest to fight for what is right. 🇺🇸
I am going to through my piillow away and will never by a pillow from him again.wow you never know the heart of the person.
I truly hope little Kyle enjoys prison !
its not a true nbc report without "trump supporter"
Why is the media stripping this patriot of his rights. This case will be tried in the courts , not on your tv show. Everyone send money for his defense. He killed one of them when the guy pointed a gun at him.
Sounds about white.....
I'm getting all new pillows for the house.
Clearly self-defense
Over fking what, politics! Wake up to your selves u wankers
That's fantastic to know.  I'm not even sure why they arrested him to begin with this is a clear case of self-defense.
Self defense or not, my soul would be CRIPPLED if I took someone's life. But, they act like they are celebrating.
He wasn’t allowed to use the gun aside from hunting
Im going to buy some new pillows from my pillow now.
America is one messed-up country
Boycotting my pillow
Kyle is an American action hero, I'd buy the action figure.
Well heck, he only murdered two people.
He was acting in self defense.
See, America? Crime is okay as long as you’re famous!
wait what?!?!?!?
Good.👏👏👏👏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This kid belongs behind bars
When someone like theses two men steps up and help get this poor boy get out of jail for defending his life against those thugs it’s so remarkable.   We the people on the right needs to get behind them.   Such as Mike that owns my pillow and buy his product.    And by the way his pillows are awesome.    So buy a couple from him.    And thanks to the star that put up his cash to help this kid that he doesn’t even know.   Mr Star if I could ever be a help to you just text to this number and I will do whatever I can.  These are two awesome people that put their money where their mouths are.     God Bless you two.
He was acting in self defense!!! Alot more of this can happen if America doesn't start to act right. Very happy to hear he is out on bail because he is innocent.  We  need to make room for all of the crooked politicians when the swamp is drained
Domestic terrorism, sponsored by mypilllow
Ought to give him a medal and huge apology! As for the rest of yaaaaaaas........
Absolutely disgusting.
nothing but prayers for everyone involved. shouldn't of happened all together.
I’m so disappointed. A Christian? This is a bunch of bull. They were running away, what was he even doing there? Celebrating killing and violence. I am shocked and disgusted.
Oh wow!!!!!
What a shame
Kid has his first 2 hits under his belt  barely old enough to shave   It’s going to be a long life
Omg unexpected ricky schroeder, that is awesome.
He should have never been arrested.  Just taking out the trash.
spending 2 million dollar bail on anyone is stupid
How much was actually paid? 2 million or 200k?
Of course the white racist pillow bitter bailed his new boyfriend out of jail
To the people who disliked this: I guarantee that you would not let someone into your house. Regardless if they were "protesting" breaking & entering to destroy something on God's Earth is not okay. Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong but protect his friend's property. Oh and btw: what's funny is people who disliked hate the police, but when Rittenhouse showed up with a gun y'all cried for the police (>.<)
WTF is wrong with people; I'd rather them get Joe exotic out of jail then a punk kid who killed people  WTactualF?!?
HAHAHA I bet many leftist just squirted with pleasure seeing this to make fake anger..
Kid is a hero, he did society a favor taking out the leftwing trash. 💪👍🤘
AMEN!!!
HAHAHA I bet many leftist just squirted with pleasure seeing this to make fake anger..
I want to give a Testimony on how I got Cured From Herpes . 7 Months ago I was Diagnosed of Herpes . I was having some outbreaks. I went to see a Doctor and many Blood Tests was done on me. My Doctor told me that there’s no cure for Herpes Virus I felt bad, I went online searching for a possible cure for Herpes Virus, I saw a post of IHIBOR A herbal doctor that cured someone from Herpes. I contacted him and told him how I’m feeling he said his herbal medicine can cure me. He sent me the medicine via Courier Service and I received the medicine some days after he sent it, i took the medicine as prescribed by him. Before the completion of the medication the symptoms stopped. I went to the Doctor and carried out another blood test, surprisingly I was Negative. I haven’t had any symptoms anymore, you can contact him Email address:_________________________________ (drihiborherbalhome@gmail.com) via WhatsApp +2349050141449 ...
Self defense!  Let him go!
WTF
Birds of a feather flock together
The kid is messed up, Lady justice can't see but will weigh her supreme power in accordingly.
Looks like I am going to get some My Pillows, have to support those who help our heroes.
Yo this guy got out the gulag
free el chapo too then wtf lmfao
Good for him
Pathetic you came to my state killed a guy and then went home to a different state 100% not self defense shoulda stayed home hope he gets back in jail
Kalief Browder, black man, died by suicide after facing traumas in jail as he was held without trial for 3 years for allegedly stealing a backpack. He spent 2 years in solitary confinement. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17 years old and illegally carried a gun to an environment where people are already angry. What do you know? He provoked violence. He got a $2 Million dollar bail.
He was acting in self defense.  Watch the video.
Can you see 666....
Wait for the movie, their going to make him a hero😨😨😨😨😨😨so sad
Let freedom ring!! Patriots unite!!
Viva Kyle!
It was clear self defense.
Welcome to third world, or worse!
this kid was given a gun to do exactly what that group wanted to do, shoot someone. kyle should go free, the group (adults) that armed him and drove him too the area should be charged with murder.
I am a legal, gun owning American, and as far as I’m concerned, he’s a murderer. He lives in Illinois and traveled across state lines to Wisconsin with a rifle, that he’s not legally allowed to carry cause he's under age, or possibly cross state line with and that rifle isn’t even registered under his name cause a friend brought it for him. He has no right to say he acted in self defense.   It’s idiots like him that make it difficult for people who are legal, law abiding gun owners to own firearms.
His Pillows will not sell like they used to. And they will be blood pillows.
Can we just start with why this kid was in another state carrying a weapon, you patriotic hypocrites?
What a joke!!!! How sad and sick!
Delay trial until after January, please!
GooD!
Never ever owning that product, link yourself with extremism, no integrity
When I was a youngster in Staten Island, N.Y., during a Football team party for our 1978 Peewee Football league. I carried Ricky Schroeder on my shoulders from Hylan Blvd.  back to the house where the party was. He and a few other younger brats were getting carried away with throwing Crab Apples at City Buses going by, AND passenger cars! I was Eleven years old, and I think Ricky was about 7 or 8. The little movie Star thought he was invincible because of the Hit Remake of the movie, "The Champ." Jon Voight played Wallace Berriy's part and Ricky Schroeder played Jackie Cooper's role, of The Champs son. Great movie.  Schroeder actually DID do a phenomenal job. Little faker!  Anyway, I'm glad Kyle is out, and I recommend that he watch the movie Hacksaw ridge, and never ever fire a weapon again!  It's time for ULTRA Humility son. Real men don't need guns. No offense to those who have them, but Kyle has exercised his second amendment right enough for this lifetime. PEACE.
America!!!!Thank God he’s out he should’ve never been in there
Michael Lindell and Ricky Schroder ---are you willing to be asked again after the trial is over about how proud you are of doing this? Just asking.
Let this sink in , after his conviction , Rittenhouse is going to prison for life .
BLM *lol*
Bail should never even exist it just keeps the poor in prison
Self defense deserves freedom.
kid’s a loser just like the folks glorifying him.
This kid illegally crossed state borders with a gun, put himself into a situation where his presence would escalate matters (especially with a rifle in hand) and then shot three people as a result, killing two. First off self defense doesn’t stand because he PUT himself into a situation knowing someone may end up dead as a result, and two, he was there armed ILLEGALLY. Three, he killed two people as a result of his gross negligence. This child is a monster
Michael is a smart man he’s targeting his market😂😂
This is why Liberals love communism.
If you say Kyle is criminal , then you should do nothing when a real criminal put gun on your head !!!
So obviously self defense. More fake news.
rittenhouse is disgusting enough, and now we add two more stupids to the list: Lindell and Schroeder.
I hope he don't cop. No jury could convict him use that gfm  money to hire the best defence you can afford.
Sad that we’ve stooped so low and can’t see our hypocrisy
Right on. Self defense is self defense.
These people should die.
God bless you Kyle
You can't get charged for murder if there's nobody left in the world to charge you. originally this comment was sarcasm but tbh I don't know anymore. It definitely resonates with something.
This kid is a national hero. Went into a place of chaos with only good intentions and a weapon to defend himself. Put out a dumpster fire at a gas station and got attacked and chased through the streets for doing so. If you have'nt watched all video surrounding the event you are in the dark. Kyle is what all Americans should aspire to be. Best wishes kid-
Only trumpsters could praise a MURDER and then call themselves CHRISTIANS
Guy throws a shopping bag at this hot headed kid with a gun who lacks respect for human life and lacks respect for his weapon - gets shot dead, 5 shots. People watch it happen, try to take his gun, and one teen “hits” him lightly with a skateboard - gets shot dead. A third teen is just standing nearby - gets shot too, for no reason, luckily survives. That’s not self defense, and it’s not defense of personal property, since he owned nothing there. He saw the protests on TV and took a gun across state lines and into a situation that was already involving high tensions and violence. He intentionally escalated the situation to become deadly. He’s not some innocent kid, and his parents should have done better.
Kyle Rittenhouse is not a HERO, he’s a killer who murdered two people. Killing is bad choice because it’s bad Karma.
Two million dollar bail for defending yourself.
Thank you mike your awsome 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I will NEVER buy a pillow from that guy.. Disgraceful young punk !!!
WOW!!! I was shocked to hear Micael Lindell helped with the bail money, Always loved Ricky , he was awesome on Lonesome Dove. My favorite movie.
Is that like voter fraud ,you claim it to be true ,but have no evidence of the facts,root in prision young fool
What happened to the sexual offenders and ex-convicts that were chasing after Kyle trying harm him?
A teen with a gun 🤦
Wisdom says He shouldn't have been at that protest, however the shooting was totally justified and he should not have been put in jail in the first place.

It's a sad state of affairs. I'm willing to bet that some of these same people who are looking at this young man as an innocent kid are some of the same people who did not and would not look at Trayvon Martin the same way.
Kyle in the end you will be set free.
He claims? No, he very clearly was.
Kyle Rittenhouse is a hero.  I'll take him on my team anytime, anywhere.
Who went straight to the comments?
Who drives across state to protect some old boss's parking lot? Lol he just wanted to get his hands dirty. If he wanted to be a medic why wouldn't he just volunteer emt?
It's about dam time he's out.. and shame on all those who keep him locked up..
Go team America!
Yea, must be nice being able to breathe fresh air. Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber can't breathe at all after being killed by a LARPer out past his bedtime. Hope they throw the book at him and every page sticks.
Why hasn't the black guy that pointed a pistol at him been charged???  You hypocrites make every US citizen sick!!! Communist scum!!!!
lol pillow guy!
Can't wait to see that kid behind bars and the right wing crazies go reeeee
Wtf?
He is definitely guilty he committed muder he claims self defense. But let's break this down what this trash did. He went to a hostile environment with a loaded gun. So answer me this white America. Why did he go up there? The cop's didn't call him for back up. His property or life wasn't in danger. His family wasn't threatened. He chose to go up there with a loaded weapon into a hostile environment for no reason and when he was spotted with a weapon and confronted he shot. He shouldn't have never went up there in the first place. He had no business going up there at all. Non of this would have happened had he just stayed home but his white privilege let him walk right past police and that in it self is enough to condem him for murder.  Same thing with George zimmerman that should have been open and shut case. He stalked Trayvon Martin he was told by police dispatch to stay in his car and not purse Trayvon but what did he do ignore the officers command and killed that boy that should have been up and shut also. He's going to answer for his crimes one-day it's a sad world we live in.
I'm glad that innocent boy got out good for him he doing God's work
Can you imagine if this would have been a black man
I thought Ricky Schroeder was dead.
It doesn't help him that the gun he used was illegal. It doesn't help him that there was a curfew that he violated. It doesn't help him that he crossed state lines to commit murder. It doesn't help him that he said yesterday 'I have no regrets'.
Thank you brother Mike
Hmm.. Rittenhouse out of jail and all of a sudden 8 people are shot in Wisconsin and shooter is on the run....   Interesting 🧐
I want to give a Testimony on how I got Cured From Herpes . 7 Months ago I was Diagnosed of Herpes . I was having some outbreaks. I went to see a Doctor and many Blood Tests was done on me. My Doctor told me that there’s no cure for Herpes Virus I felt bad, I went online searching for a possible cure for Herpes Virus, I saw a post of IHIBOR A herbal doctor that cured someone from Herpes. I contacted him and told him how I’m feeling he said his herbal medicine can cure me. He sent me the medicine via Courier Service and I received the medicine some days after he sent it, i took the medicine as prescribed by him. Before the completion of the medication the symptoms stopped. I went to the Doctor and carried out another blood test, surprisingly I was Negative. I haven’t had any symptoms anymore, you can contact him Email address:_________________________________ (drihiborherbalhome@gmail.com) via WhatsApp +2349050141449.
Be honest no one here knows what happened.  Please add to your post that its "your opinion" so and so happened.

This is why it was legal for Kyle to open carry as a minor:  Wisconsin Statute 948.60 regulates the possession of a dangerous weapon by persons under 18 years old. In paragraph (2) (a) it states:  (a) Any person under 18 years of age who possesses or goes armed with a dangerous weapon is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.  Paragraph (3) lists exceptions. (3)(c) excludes most people who are under 18, except those in violation of 941.28 or 29.304 and 29.539.  (c) This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593. This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941.28.  Statute 948.60 only applies to a person under the age of 18 who are in violation of 941.28 or not in compliance with 29.304 and 29.593.  What does it take to be in violation of 941.28? Here is the statute:  (2) No person may sell or offer to sell, transport, purchase, possess or go armed with a short-barreled shotgun or short-barreled rifle.  In the statute, short-barreled shotguns or short-barreled rifles are those which require a special license under the National Firearms Act. In general, those are rifles with a barrel less than 16 inches in length or shotguns with a barrel less than 18 inches in length, or either which have an overall length of less than 26 inches.  The rifle carried by Kyle Rittenhouse, as an ordinary AR15 type and does not fall into those categories, so Kyle was not violating 941.28.
He should have been a free man long ago
Wow, I can't believe we celebrate criminals and criminalize honest folks.
Awesome! The poor boy wrongly accused. Glad to see he is free.
I'm in Canada so pardon me if this is a dumb question but is it normal for children to run around with assault rifles in the States?
This man is innocent. The mob, BLM, antifa people inciting a riot and he defended his community and himself. This is what America is boiled down to and the media does not cover it unless it’s a white man that shot a black person. And then it becomes a racial thing. The most racial people are blacks because they use that race card every time for the last 70 years. America when will you get tired of this nonsense they project about white privilege,
Did reality jump the shark?
His butthole will never be the same. 😂😂😂 He better get use to it cus he'll be right back in there after trial.
Good
When someone opens fire in a public place and two people try to wrestle the gun from him which he ends up shooting both to death, can you really call that 'self defense'? You can try , but you won't win. Better to try, the kid was deranged from violent video games and lost his sense of reality.
All you racest leave Kyle alone,  he is right in gods eyes and true Americans lives.  Bye bye blm antifa one and the same
"He claims" more like "he was"
My pillow does need more customers that "sleep" forever.  best slogan, "sleeping for eternity.. why not sleep in the best, here use My pillow"
Meanwhile, one of the assailants pointing a handgun at him was never charged. That’s called brandishing a weapon and is a felony charge.
Disgusting.
omg i hope the judge orders psychiatric treatment.
So when Rittenhouse goes to prison for life, which he will without a doubt, these 2 idiots should go with him for bailing him out.  My crackhead Pillow Guy and Ricky Schroeder, both of which have been arrested on Domestic Violence charges themselves.  3 Clowns without a brain cell between them.  How repugnant.   I guess people who enjoy violence stick up for each other.  Thugs helping thugs.  Throw away the key.
Glad to see this Hero released and hope he makes millions with the lawsuite against the city and state for the communist dictator crap against this wonderful and pratroid young man
Lock him up😤
Hmmm, Trump's buddy the pillow guy. I wonder how the thought processed there?
Funny how they post this video right next to the Milwaukee mall shooting... liberals at there finest
He’ll grow up to be an officer of some sort I bet
Only in 2020 can I say "the president of the United States of America friend who's a crackhead (true) Mike Lindell and the kid from silver spoons show, put up 2million to bond out a murder??????      🖕2020🖕
Just wait to read the comments and you see what this country is really all about! If that was a black boy I can see the double standard of how he was a thug or gang member! His parents would have been labeled unfit and arrested as well. We don't get that same energy trust me!😂😂😂😂 Some of y'all too funny. No worries tho we waking up very well to all the b.s in this country trust that! We ain't gonna be having to many more of these kinds of cases!✌
MURDERER!!!!!
just bought a pillow topper.
Anyone protesting a criminal like Floyd, Blake and Taylor deserve to get shot. Dummies 🤦🏽‍♂️
This is America the land of racist people
That was jail. The future for this racist murderer is prison.
Notice the amount of likes the people standing up for kyle have vs the amount of likes the people calling him a murderer have
All that money, wasted. How is this not virtue signaling?
Yep watched the video he clearly was being attacked and it was self defense.
And we all thought self defense was LEGAL. Any charges for the 1 armed Armed Felon who tried to shoot him???? Any one else up for a skateboard to the skull???? Yah okey.
This kid is a hero of angry white men. To the rest of us he is a murderer. Lock him up!
If someone breaks into my house, and I shoot them - it is self defense. If I go into the home of someone else, and they get mad at me, and then I shoot the home owner, it is not self defense. How can I make this any more clear?
Just threw out 'My Pillow!'
RIP My Pillow company
Disgrace
Disgusting. he gunned down a man who was mentally ill and homeless. Then he kills and wounds two people trying to capture him when he runs away and he’s taking photos grinning. How immature could a person be. It was illegal for him to carry that gun and he knew it.
Schroeder will never work again 🤣
giving bail to a murderer who has 'no regrets' for murdering two people is now the sign of a humanitarian? What has happened to the right win in America. Are they all violent fascists now who condone violence against the other side no matter what?
Check out my book on my channel
I thought Ricky Schroder was dead, all along he was just a has been.
I wonder how they can claim self defense when there's a video of him getting up and firing at fleeing people?????? make it make sense lol
rittenhouse was obviously acting in self defense if you simply watch the video...fing idiocy he was even charged let alone 1st degree murder...
If Kyle was black he would have been held without bail until his trial #merica # whiteprivilege
i was just defending property that wasn't mine in a state that i don't live in from people i don't know with a gun i can't legally purchase it was self defense guys
God bless Michael (Angel) Lindell and Ricky Schroder!!!
My Pillow dude helps with a million bail for a murderer, meanwhile Dolly Pardon funds COVID vaccine research and a successful COVID Vaccine from Moderna.  Which is a better use of money?
Praise the Lord that he has these two men of the Lord helping him!!!
I don't know why companies get involved with crap like this.  I won't be doing any business with that company.
Best news all day!!!!!!
disgusting
America is a sick place
True patriot.
Let the smear campaigns begin!
Nobody should of been out acting fools that night. Rittenhouse clearly did shoot in self defense. Antifa and BLM needs to be considered terrorists and all put in prison. They horrible mean thugs only out to destroy and hurt people.
i really hope you all remember the crooked judge, prosecutor and anyone else who had a hand bringing this young man to be charged with felony crime. your a weak subhuman. they should take your home and make you live with the brothers in the hood since you caved like wet flowers for the blacks. all power to you brothers. if this is how you get change or make your voice heard then do it brothers. but you dare take any off my plate you guna get what you deserve
Murder is murder. You get a needle for that. RIP dickhead.
Still having trouble verifying that he is being kept in Wisconsin. Illinois sure doesn't want this murderer in our state.
Kyle is not a hero! He came armed from another state to supposedly protect that community. Sure, right. I have a bridge to sell you if you believe that nonsense.
Those are lives poorly led. Won't care if they're cut short.
So basically murder is allowed as long as you have the money to pay off everyone?
His case is textbook self defense. It’s ridiculous he is even having to go to court to fight murder charges. Everyone that attacked him deserved what they got. However on the flip side he shouldn’t have been there in the first place. A 17 year old doesn’t belong where he was. Even with that considered he was well within his rights to shoot them. I would have done the same thing.
I saw the videos, this kid was there to protect business owners property from burning and looting.. he's not a murderer.
This dumb kid epically screwed up. He is NOT a hero by any means.
His 19 year old friend is in hot water over buying this assault rifle for a MINOR and the minor killing 2 people and wounding another
apparently on the right if you murder people it's ok as long it's one of the groups you hate.
And he'd better stay out.
Now, Kyle is a definite flight risk.  And, Mike Lindell : I just threw away the pillows of yours that I bought and will never buy them again. What in the world are you thinking?
Welp, looks like My Pillow is about to go bankrupt.
Then he touts a Black Riffle Coffee Company t-shirt, reminding every effing body of why he was jailed in the first place. Somebody should be advising  him better!
Don’t understand why he has so much support. He had to break the law in order to purchase the gun. Then he took is illegal gun across state lines to open carry in a state that again he was to young to open carry in thus breaking the law again. On top of that he killed 2 and injured 1.
my pillow guy is the mannn
Let’s look at it from a different angle; if he was a black, Latino or Muslim would any one bailed them out? When you do it self defense but others are terrorist. What a justice.
Unbelievable! A 17 year old white kid with a gun, crosses over from Illinois to Wisconsin, with the help of his mother, in which one has to be 18 years old to carry in Wisconsin. And, yet, he's being elevated, as a hero. Really?
these comments are musty
Time to boycott My Pillow co. for supporting two murderers.
funny how much you see about this, and yet all of the rioting and looting from the far left you really don't hear anything about from the fake news
Kyle deserves a medal.
If my kid is in that situation I’ll tell him to do the same thing , Kyle is a hero
Kyle was attacked by these anarchists he needs to be acquitted.
Great job that kid is a hero
Gotta point out the pillow guy being a "Trump supporter", totally relevant.
He illegally brought an assault rifle to a violent protest with the intent to be tough daring others to approach and assault him!  Now he has the nerve to claim self-defense after going around bragging that he shot someone!  If that boy goes to prison he'll be found dead in his cell faster than Epstein.
"Poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids."- Joe Biden
Ever see his commercials on TV? Always has a cross outside his shirt. A true Christian. A Trump man and a Christian. What a lovely combination. Loves to separate children from their parents, loves to hock phony cures for COVAD. What a blessing he is to the faithful.
He is the poster boy for what the grown men should've been doing in that town! God Save USA
kY%%xx More covid-19 prevention, remedy etc and music which I composed visit my video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0MrrbAm0vc
He acted in self defense yet gets charged, what a world
If he had been black and unarmed, walking around as he did, the cops may have shot him.  Hump, i have a cousin who's in jail for 50 yrs, on just suspicion.  The American justice system??????????  And his supposed crime had nothing to do with violence. No one got killed.  Rittenhouse, 2 dead.
thanks for people kindest
Want to bring peace to a street protest? Stay home and watch it on t.v. Don't take a gun made for war to a protest and then claim you are bringing peace. That won't work in any court.
The videos I've seen floating out there clearly and irrefutably demonstrate he was defending himself and then ran as fast as possible to the police whom he called and surrenders before he's attacked again.  Obvious self defense.  Why does the FOX building still stand?  I'm totally cool with a surgical strike on all MM transmission towers.  All of them are complicit in treason of the highest order. Take them out!! Trump is the ultimate Teflon Don and he's justified and righteous.  Beating them at their own game playing by the rules with both hands tied behind his back while they break all the rules and still can't get a thing done.  This is what happens when you get too much money - too much ego - too much inbreeding.
The Boy Went to Help this community , to defend the citizens bright to Protests  But others wanted Chaos & destruction & a split second encounter with an angry Felon change his life , he shoot out of fear Does He not have also have  Right to Defend himself
He does not need to claim self defense, watch the different videos.
Wow how disgraceful
Really Silver Spoons??
Kyle Rittenhouse: A true AMERICAN HERO
If he stayed in Illinois where he lived, and wasn't a minor out pass curfew walking around with illegal possession of a firearm. He'd never been in this mess, he'd be at home helicopter swinging on girls with his crocs on.
God bless you Kyle !!!!👍🙏
He went to a different state, armed, to "defend himself"
Ricky Schroeder stock will drop,Its all about race BUT THE WHITE AMERICA IS GONE THATS WHY WHITE PEOPLE ARE MAD
Never should have been in jail. Clear self defense from a mob of criminals. Saying that, the bail amount was ridiculous. This guy ain’t running away. Going to buy another pillow tonight.
Taking the law into your own hands which leads to you murdering two people and severely injuring another really has no defense at all. There was a curfew, the gun was bought illegally, he murdered people whose only 'crime' was they were trying to get the gun away from him before he killed anyone.
Makes my heart swell to see that BRCC tshirt on him. Glad there are good people left in the world. May justice prevail
Good news. Nice, thanks!
wtf
Saint Kyle is finally free!!! Keep the faith young man. This country is in desperate need of heroes and Kyle Rittenhouse is that hero.
Truly sickening. This is like trump grinning with a thumbs up in a photo with Melania holding a baby whose parents were killed in El Paso by a gunman inspired by right wing hate media and trump's own words.  BTW- The kid's atty is a fool for allowing his client to parade with his t-shirt and grinning smiles...NO sign of accepting the seriousness, let alone ANY look of remorse for ending two lives and maiming a third for life.  The photo says "FU - we're above the law...and try to do something about it".
Shoting people IN THE BACK is NOT self defense. WTF?
Just another dumbshit kid in waaaaay over his head.
Yea if this was a mexican or african american teen who did that there would be no help no bail. A kid like this is no different then any gang banger he had a ar15 hes not legally able to own laws should be held for everyone the same way
Will not be purchasing any more of the my pillows.
If your white republican and carry a gun you can get away with anything in this country..so its no surprise a trump sheep and a domestic abuser helped get him out..your in good company kid.
And like that a real american hero is released KAG US 2020
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Fact based news, finally.
Based and my pillow pilled.
Another childhood hero ruined. I had no idea Schroeder was a white supremacist. :(
What if the child molester stole his rifle?
Omg wtf Ricky Schroeder is a fing moron!  So is the My Pillow guy.  So now we will have all these kids shooting ppl wtf is wrong with you?  Apparently a lot!  Omg just beyond my reason!
Duuude I'm From a blue state aka CA and common sense tells me that this kid was TOTALLY defending himself! Let him try to recover from his actions and may the 2 victims rest in peace 🙏 the video is loud and clear! We need to heal as a whole nation 2gether! Use common sense people 😐
Gross. Disgusting.
If you condone murder because the murderer is on your side politically, can you really be called a decent American? or even a decent person?
He is not a murder suspect he and his family hopefully will start sueing the courts
The men’s conscience have a limit, it will fall into his weakness when he hears the owner of the terror it’s coming
Hope he gets the death penalty
Helping a stone cold killer? Are y’all nuts. Glad I don’t live anywhere near you people
It's a shame. this punks victims are as dead as ricky's career.
free klye !
SELF DEFENSE IS NOT MURDER
I hope his court day is far enough down the line that I don’t have to think about him being pardoned.
BASED
At the end of the day, two men are dead because this punk wanted to play Rambo!
I thought about buying those pillows but I will never ever buy anything from this guy.
doesn't matter, he already admitted to police that he purchased the gun illegally, snitched on his friend who purchased it for him (who now has his own felony), and has 2 deaths on his hands. The bail won't save him.
Fake news media: He claims he was acting in self defense.  He literally was. Why does the media constantly gotta twist and butcher every story? We’ve all seen the video. They literally attacked him as he ran. If it were me I would have shot them more then he did. The guy who was shot in the arm wouldn’t have been alive to tell his story if he hit me in the head with a skateboard. The kid has way more self control then I do. This kid is a victim and he should sue not only the people who attacked him, but the fake media for diminishing his name.
Run up get fukn done up.
And you obviously know nothing about laws
Worthless human being deserves to rot in jail. I hope nothing but the worst for him for the entirety of whatever pathetic life he'll live
Glad he’s back home with his family. A true hero, a true patriot. Long Live Kyle Rittenhouse! What you did will not go in vain ❤️🇺🇸
Ugly pos.
That’s great news.  Now I hope that he sues the crap out of your network of fakenews.  I donated to him.
Yay!!!  Innocent. Great lawyer in Lin Wood.
ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS Kyle Rittenhouse  WHO WAS A 17 YEAR OLD CHILD WHO WENT TO A Protest with an open Carry AR-15 Assault weapon who killed 2 people and think he was some kind of hero,  DO NOT HAVE A HEART OR SOUL.   GOD HELP THE  U.S.  THEY ARE LOST SOULS. Kyle will never be the same again,  his life as he knew it will be over.
When this goes to trial he’ll be found as defending himself, only an ignorant fool believes otherwise. But they commit fraud and injustice everyday so anything’s possible.
Let's all remember that the felon that was illegally carrying a gun who was chasing Kyle with the entire incident VERY well documented, has not been charged with anything.
Stop called riots “protests”, when people are being chased and infrastructure is on fire, it is no longer able to be considered a protest...
This is DISCUSTING!!!  If you had one of his stupidvpillows I would cut it up into little pieces and send it back with my garbage bag inside!!!
Black and white people should not only protect each other but their community as well
If you wish to live a little longer squeeze the trigger and dont be afraid of doing so as long as it is to defend your property, your family, your friends, yourself, your country. Your president.by God do it.
A GREAT HERO,GOD BLESS
Good. He did nothing wrong.  A racist kept calling him the n word, (maybe because he looks Hispanic and racists are ignorant?) and tried to attack him. Then 2 guys chased him, one attacked with a skateboard while the other tried to murder him with a gun. It was a clear case of self defense and is all on camera.
Trump needs to pardon him he needs to tell Kyle to take a deal immediately and then pardon him.. at least he'll be able to be home for Christmas with his family those other people were attacking him in the head with a skateboard he's supposed to sit there and let it happen no.
For some reason I never bought a my pillow.... almost pulled the trigger a couple times tho
Rittenhouse shot his first victim in the back, that's not self defense.
Shoulda never been jailed to begin with. It was obviously self defense.
I can't wait for schools to open.  We'll see how happy they are when kids are murdered
That’s alright he haven’t went to trial yet. They will CONVICT !!!
This is horrible.
Thank You Mike and Rick May God Bless You 🙏
What parent would drive their kid to a protest, armed with an assault weapon?
Kyle Rittenhouse was a 17 year old child who went to a protest to protect property that was not even his with an AR-15 Assault Rifle,  he might be smiling now, but he will never be the same again,  if he has a heart and a soul, he will have to live with this for the rest of his life, and if he does not have a heart or soul,   GOD HELP HIM.    I cannot image killing anyone.,  He needs to go to prison, If he was black I am sure the police would have shot and killed him.
lol the funny thing is. my pillows were just delivered today along with my black rifle coffee. good combination.
When a BLM protestor was attacked and defended himself with a gun he was later murdered in his driveway by police. When a right wing terrorist is taken into custody he's treated as a hero and makes bail. I'll never shed a tear when a cop gets killed.
how do you get bail on a murder charge?
I would never buy anything from my pillow guy,and have told every one I know to do the same.
Justified shooting! Self defense!
Kyle is a hero.....
Not buying one of his pillows which support a teenage murderer.
Burning my pillow now.
You know we live in a messed up world when self defense will land you in prison. The fact he was even attacked and forced to defend himself in the first place shows how messed up things are. He was simply defending businesses and giving first aid to people who needed it. He even tried turning himself in after the shooting saying he never wanted to hurt anyone, and yet, these worthless wastes of space known as media outlets call him a murderer, a white supremacist, a racist. Absolutely disgusting. I can't stand what "journalism" has become. Nothing but creating narratives and destroying people's reputation with lies if they don't fit within the narrative.
Outrageous! He should've been denied bail.
Good he should get out.
what a mess of hatred Donald trump has promoted
hes too rich to be in prison. hes a good kid. he comes from a good family. and all that other bs
Self defense all day. What kind of moron attacks armed men with a chain?
Going out looking for trouble like a police officer without authority is not self defense. Police was there. You can't just join them with an illegal carry weapon
He's already been charged with murder. Being out on bail hardly means he's 'free'.
The 2 men the media is so sad about were criminals and 1 of them was a convicted pedophile. The fake sadness from the media tries to make it look like these were 2 good samaritans helping the homeless.
The "video" only shows the second and third shootings..  they were attacking to disarm him after he shot the first person... Get it straight folks!
You freaks would rather protect the wealthiest crap that they buy rather than lives.
American justice  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Free him of all charges.
Kyle is a patriot that loves his country. That was self defense all day long. They forced that young man to shoot them in fear for his life. If you squirrel jump a man with a gun then you deserve what you get. Those three felons were going through life without ever knowing pain but that night Kyle introduced them to pain. He is a hero.
Rickie Schroder is the man!!! So is the pillow guy.
Good for him
He was acting in self-defense. But you have to really take your emotions out of it and simply examine what actually happened.  The only crime the kid committed was carrying a rifle under the age of 18.. & That is a misdemeanor.  And it does not nullify his right to defend his life.
Unbridled racism.  Supporting a proven murderer.  Completely shameful!
Please look at this ****(EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)**** video. This is 4 REAL!!!  You should COPY this ENTIRE post, so u Don't LOSE this, and u can Look at it Later https://m.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR22dwB7sGhzqdZD9S3c4lpIj9h7gd8r0S7Tuu1tBsHpaR4MucYQ_aCZ0vY&v=XjJomA4NDQI News interview https://m.youtube.com/watch?fbclid=IwAR30R3_ZKXhnb4BpCBfLtlQ_sCxsGdFC4g-2EihKqjs-0blt-B93yeUZTmk&feature=share&v=-Ypi1j_1T9A This is the video of the AUSTRALIAN WESTALL sighting.

Go to ***(16 MINUTES)*** into this video, to see the ZIMBABWE sighting  re-interview the Kids Grown up now as ADULTS and u can C that they r NOT LYING https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uF82qCdx05Y This is Exactly the Alien as Described by the Kids from the ZIMBABWE UFO sighting ABOVE https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=COmefEEXYlQ
He should be free
Awesomeness!!!!!
The Justice Dept. says people that look like him and share  his beliefs are the biggest threat to America!!!
He seems really happy in the thumbnail.  He should remember he killed.
Thanks Mike. Poor kid would be dead if he did not defend him self from that mob. I'll be buying more of your products!
It's sad people died, but the kid was just protecting/defending himself. #notguilty
This little murderer deserves life in prison.
So nice of Lindell to help Shittenhouse. MAGATS all around.
Not surprised he was bailed out knowing the MyPillow guy was a crack addict and a trump supporter too. Sounds legit
you people think someone who can make a pillow is all that.someone smart makes a medecine that saves millions like antibiotics. thats smart.
Why was he even arrested wtf
If he was black he would of had two life sentence
Bail is a loan people with good credit get good loans. will be paid back 100%
must feel good to know that you could help a murderer get back out on the streets again so he could murder more innocent people
Y’all really sending a great message to people making them think it’s ok to bring rifles to protests
Its more like Kyle knew his rights and bought a gun on purpose because he was hoping for this type of confrontation. Sad at the fact we're allowing him to get away with it
JESUS CHRIST IS LORD AND HE LOVES YOU @ whoever this is for
Kyle needs the same medicine he dished out...
TMW - Economics 101: How trickle down doesn't work by rich people's money for politics not jobs & families loosing homes in a global pandemic.
Gtfo. Why do I feel like a few right-wing big wigs got together and funneled money to MyPillow guy and instructed him to cover Rittenhouse 10% bail? Gee, I wonder why.
Murderer is out on bail .
And the Black Rifle Coffee Company T shirt 😎. Veteran owned and operated. TOP NOTCH coffee
Can we collectively put this MyPillow chump out of business?
Note to self: don't bring a skateboard to a gunfight.
FINALLY ....... makes you think twice about owning a gun!!
We don't need ur service  no more mr pillow
God bless that kid👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🧠🧠🧠😎
👎
Perfect!!
Bail amount was obviously politically biased. It was self defense, he was running away when he tripped. Bad guys chose poorly
glad hes getting out!
Right On My pillow Guy! And screw you fake news! Haha
Wtf
Claim?
Bro if he was black he woulda had no bail
The right protection for his complexion
Lets face reality whether hes out in public or in prison someone is going to take justice into their hands for him murdering people. Hes done for
Nobody should buy My Pillow.
White privilege
His team bought him back 😂
If a riotous crowd is trying to injure you with weapons, you have the right to defend yourself with lethal force.  The self-defense was clear in the video footage.
Wao...really? He is being rewarded for killing someone? Amazing! I guess America is a great place to be
self defense?
Him having a weapon was illegal.
HE IS INNOCENT
Isn't it messed up we live in a time where people find it politically advantageous to bail out a murderer?
He's a murderer. He's a murderer and just like that, he's not only free but rewarded and praised. Trump supporters run around saying abortion is murder yet they worship a man who took too lives and injured another. I can't imagine what this is doing to the victims families
Michael Lindell can take his pillows and shove them up his .............
What a great guy! God bless him!
A teen with a rifle..what to do..what to do..ah i got..
Well he’ll get his
hmm well did anyone stop to think that maybe a child shouldn't be out with a gun during a protest... just a thought and here's some more for you this entire situation could've just been avoided had the kid not been out there and instead been inside his house safe. he clearly had a form of self-protection if anyone was to intrude which those two people killed weren't. this whole situation i absolutely hate to see im not a democrat but i certainly do not condone this child's actions its absolutely horrific and the kid should be in jail for his actions. i pray that this child learns his lesson and realizes his mistakes and starts taking accountability for his actions and for the families of those affected by the murders and who those who now have trauma from these actions. amen
Good
100% self defense
Fight hard to save him because he will do some painful time. With his my pillow under his stomach
the kid's a hero! He killed a domestic abuser AND a paydofyle!
In a world of white supremacy
Kyle Rittenhouse is an American hero
This is just gross
Murder suspect? God, the media needs to die. Literally
Kind of want to buy some pillows all the sudden...
The hero walks free
Somebody gonna put rounds in that lily boy.
We love you Kyle!
He had to get bailed out by a pillow company guy? What happened to all that money that was raised for him?
Kyle is a noble young man.  Why are they so rare these days?  Can you imagine if we were in times of war in THIS generation of young people?
All three of em trash!
Does anyone care about the video that surfaced after that proved that Kyle did nothing wrong and was defending himself? No? Okay.
Pillow guy is stupid
Good. He was acting in self defense
BOYCOTT MY PILLOW
Good! There's no reason he shouldn't be free
https://youtu.be/Qr5RHFCT-b4 You Don't Know Who You're Fighting For. World rulers have no interest in our well being.
He should've never been in jail in the first place.  It was clearly self defense.
Love Michael Lindell! Wishing Rittenhouse the best!
At least it wasn't Alfonso Ribeiro.  That would have really been a mind-bender.
that my pillow guy is a good dude and I hope this kid is found not guilty
Wow its good to be white..hahaha
So happy to see Kyle free ☝️🇺🇸🦅his life was in great danger a great Patriot.
Good it looked like self defence
Amen!!! Now i want to go buy some *My Pillow* products!!!
Way to go Kyle and Co..... This is great to see.
Gross
BOYCOTT MY PILLOW!
nothing screams white privilege like being an underaged kid in possession of an assault weapon, at a protest about police brutality that  took the life of a black person, then end up killing 2 people at that protest with a weapon you shouldn't legally be in possession of, then being able to make a 2 million dollar bail. Come on, you can't make this up.
Don't both Rick Schroeder and Michael Lindell have domestic violence and alcoholism issues in the past.  Figures!
You are a killer,you should be in jail Psycho.
Trump 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Good. He didn’t murder anyone it was self defense.
The promise that Trump made was that if you get into trouble I'll get you out he sent the pillow man and he sent that other unknown guy. I think they just jinxed him.
I'm turning my pillow into my kitty litter... the cat loves it  💩
Sick. Sick. Sick.
FBI said there's been a 700% rise in right wing militia violence in America since Trump took office, this kid is part of it.
I wonder if he was a black smiling teenager if they would've raised so much money to get him out if jail and hail him a hero for murdering two people we live in a twisted society. He still murder two people and my concern is are they concerned about where did he get the AK from it illegal for minor to buy such weapons again how twisted and disgusting
I'll never buy from his business. Or watch the actors movies.  That kid would never have had to defend himself if he had stay home in his own state.  No business being there and these adults enabling this behavior are ridiculous.
White privilege personified. smh
Makes good sense to me, the group of thugs are the ones there to instigate the wars. Kyle went there to save Americans Rights to Freedom... from Bullies, leftist, the Obama Cabal and the Coup d’état, Adam Schiff - a Traitor and Liar, and other perverts. If you think this is the end of fights, get prepared... if the Democrats think Americans will back down and let them steal the election from Trump, the real war will begin. What nerve of these arrogant people whom think we will sit down and take their crap, unlike Obama’s Line, we will fight till we win. Wisdom, Faith, Courage and our belief in God will be all we need to win, and we will win big. Trump supporters do not want a war; however, if necessary we will dig in, and fight to the end and we will win. Judges that are use to siding with the bullies, to get benefits to prosper their lives, better get with the program, follow the laws of the land or you will lose to. The games of the Obama days, judges paid off, money laundering to get rich, pay to play to to get more benefit to make you even more wealth are gone. Treason Charges are coming - Guantanamo Bay will be great... a Military Tribune Hearing, found guilty of Treason, followed  by your final breath on this earth will be welcomed... it is y’all that should feel guilty.... not us.
IGGY BIN CHANNEL. WATCH THOSE NIELSEN'$ GO ●
Well the Today show has posted this without comment on how disgusting and hateful the corporate and celebrity endorsement of racist murderers is. They have plenty of opinions at Today, so I guess this means they are cool with murderous political violence from the Right.
Pathetic
MURDERER!
Thank god someone got this poor kid out. A real american if you ask me
Yaaaaaa Kyle
I'll be buying new pillows 👍🇺🇸
How many Democrats out there made "Michael Lindell" rich? He used your money to bail this kid out that should not have had a weapon in the first place. Btw i'm an Independent. Research the companies you patronize. Just because an item isn't affordable doesn't mean the owner has the same point of view as you. Just food for thought.
yay he is out i am glad he got out because he literally did nothing wrong
Self Defense. I saw the Video, a MOB was coming After HIM!! He was NOT going after anyone.
There is nothing good about thus kid killing people Intentionally!! Welp there goes the neighborhood!! Nothing good will come to him.... I feel Sorry for him and those who condone it!
Good for him!
This is about as disgusting at one can get.
Trumpists are murderers 💩🚽💣💩
Plea deal, ?
Riots, not protests.
Racist MF's
0:24 because thats what happened as can be seen very clearly in the videos of the incident.
To whomever is reading this, I want to remind you that God loves you and he has a wonderful plan for your life! 😁  If you were to suddenly die this very moment where do you think you would spend eternity?? If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and he sent his Son Jesus to die for your sins that you would not perish but have eternal LIFE!!  God came to me, saved me and filled me with his spirit when I was at a low point in my life a few years ago. God will do the same for you if you allow him. You have a choice, but YOU ARE GODS CHOICE and he will NEVER CHANGE! He wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is death! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9,13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus is the son of God and that you died and rose again and are coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I have a home in heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because Jesus Loves You and has a plan for your life!!   If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://youtu.be/tBR2nCS5zFI
So... he's still going to prison when all is said and done 😒
Free Kyle.....I watched several videos of Kyle Rittenhouse that evening from different angles and this was absolutely self-defense!
Arthur Frederick Goode, III  was a convicted child murderer who was electrocuted in Florida in 1984 When asked if he had any last request. With a smile, he answered, "Yes, I want Ricky Schroder to sit on my lap when I am strapped into the electric chair."
Mike and his patented fill save the day!!
The teen who defended himself from armed individuals who had guns and objects.  Get it straight media.
He murdered two people whose only 'crime' was they tried to take the gun away from him before he killed anyone.... and he now says he has 'no regrets'..... that's cold blooded killer talk.
Interesting No GOP members helped post bail nor did any of Trump's kids after champion him as some patriot. Yet 2 weirdos did. It's almost like the GOP saw the evidence and now trying to distance themselves from him
I'm glad I didn't buy one of those pillows!! I guess we should not be surprised at the people who support this type of be behavior! WOW MICHEAL AND RICKEY!  YOU HAVE TAUGHT ME TO BE CAREFUL WHO I SUPPORT!! Proud boys
FREE KYLE RITTENHOUSE YEAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! God Bless those men
What a joke,  kills two men and still has no remorse. It's funny how this country gives murderers Bail Bonds. But rob a bank and you get No bail!!! How many Congressmen are going to get bails for crimes against the American people.❓
the dislike ratio says it all
It amazes me that so many people commenting must have been there to witness exactly what happened.
Yeah! But you went to a rally with a gun. Seems like you were looking for trouble with your gun. I've just supported the release of someone who deserves to be put away! If your concerned for your safety and know that your easily triggered or sensitive to people who oppose you, why go there? It's like touching fire and wondering why you got burnt! You was looking for a reason to use your fire arm! And these fools helped to get you out! I will be throwing My Pillow away!
If you think you need a gun to protect yourself when you're guarding someone's car lot against vandalism, have to talk a friend into purchasing a firearm for you because you're too young to legally buy it yourself, have almost no weapons training, THEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.
Don't buy products from Trump supporters!
Remember folks, if you get tripped or thrown to the ground, one guy starts hitting you, his buddy beats you with the truck of a skateboard, and a third dude, (who is illegally carrying a pistol) tries to shoot you, you are absolutely NOT supposed to defend yourself with the rifle that they would have stolen and also shot you with.
Why would they mention that the myPillow guy was a Trump supporter? How does that have anything to do with the story?
Anyone willing to bet Trump grants him a pardon before he leaves office? Its coming
Wow, I guess anybody can do this as long as they are Trump supporters. What if it was one of your relatives who was shot. Regardless of the reason. Why was a young BOY was doing out there with a deadly weapon. Did his parents approve of this. How did he get this weapon? Wow, only in America. Oh, if likes to shot people, join the Marines, Army, etc.
Kyle Rittenhouse, Ricky Schroeder, and the My Pillow guy. Jesus. This sounds like a bad episode of The Chevy Chase Show.
Some see him as a patriot. Others as a terrorist . I think the thing to take away is that in America the lines between the two are becoming so blurred we will fall into a grey divide which will in time only be distinguished by corporate interest in radical movements. Everything will be normal but only because we are to believe being radical is the only normal there is.
National hero. Self defense manuals will be written because of this guy. Handled himself and the situation perfectly. Absolutely perfectly.
If he wasn’t white they would have put him in the electric chair 🪑
This country is going down, this is really sad
it was a waste of money because he's still going to go to prison.
Self defense.
White privileged oj Simpson wasn’t granted bail
Republican radical terrorism since 1492.
I hope they riot in Kyle's town because of this.  It would be a very hard lesson.  Not as good as keeping him in jail where he belongs but still pretty funny with mommy having to go into hiding and stuff.
based
2 million bail for defending yourself?
Shooting 2 rioters who tried to attack him. It wasn't during a protest moron. ZIONIST MEDIA BS. This was self defense.
He might get off on self defense, but this would not have happened if the misguided little brat wasn't breaking the law with the gun already.
Did Steve Bannon contribute to kid's bail also?
I'm guessing silver spoons is canceled
What a hero
The Sad Sad demise of Ricky S.    Doesn't matter if he made bail or not.  His life is changed forever.  Lengthy court battles, $$$.......Oh, and he'll face civil penalties if not criminal....The kid's life is bleak...
private citizens can't turn into vigilantes and start murdering people, that is not America. All he had to do was stay home... where were his parents?
Look at those likes vs. dislikes lol!
My pillow guy...nah never convinced me
Ricky Schroder.from Silver Spoons lol that's so random. Great show though.
killed them by defending himself
My Pillow bout to go out of business 🤦🏽‍♂️💯
Excellent news !!!
I’m so glad I never bought a My Pillow.
Finally,  good for you brother!!!
Great news, God is watching over him.
Absolutely grotesque.
Wow I figured the my pillow guy would help being an ex crackhead but not silver spoons ricky.  You really want to spend your royalties like that.  Shame on you..  #Covid45 #DamnatoMemoriae #SNOWFLAKEGATE #Cult #VanillaISIS #ChristiansCanFlipflopTo
He did not have to be where he was.
This is absurd! WE ALL SEEN THIS POS!
Awesome good news ☺️☺️👍
I will NEVER buy from the pillow grifter! EVER!
you can't leave two people dead and one seriously injured and claim 'I did nothing wrong and have no regrets'. He came to murder and that's just what he did.
Next time it'll be the other way around, in the name of self defence
thank you and look at the dislikes
white people...
White privilege at it's finest
He shouldn't be in jail!!
These comments are disappointing af
God bless the true American young guy
I just gained so much support for Mike Lindell
I saw this coming. Does anyone know how much he has in his “GoFundMe” account yet, just curious. Thanks.
Thank God, he's home for the holidays. Poor Mom must be losing it. :\
Kyle rittenhouse is a patriot
Conman bails out murderer.
Hey NBC today took down my comment ahahahahha. You mad cuz I told the truth?
Claims huh well Biden “claims” he won the election
Give him life in prison. If he was black under the exact same circumstance we all unfortunately know that'd be the outcome
he was looking for trouble, to be a 'hero', and he found it.... and yes, right wing idiots are now calling him a hero.... this is America in 2020, the Idiocracy is very alive in red states.
The hero of the new nazi party, home just in time for the holidays. The families of the two people he shot and left for dead in the street aren't smiling this thanksgiving. But Kyle and his family and friends are.  Just 17 and two murders under his belt with no guilt, no remorse, no mercy — just the smiling face of a happy sociopath.
National Hero. Dont bring a skateboard to a gun fight
You don't go out and intentionally carry a fire arm with out thinking that something might happen.  I think he was looking for an altercation. Hope he is found guilty.
Sad to see criminals being defended and law biding citizens arrested before you talk know the facts know the story
They should've given this guy a medal.  There is always hate when you are doing gods work.
This is no surprise
Kyle Rittenhouse shot in self-defense. I applaud Mike Lindell and Ricky Shroder’s actions. Believe I’ll buy a few My Pillows as Christmas gifts. 🇺🇸

OH FINALLY!! That young Patriot & HERO did Absolutely NOTHING Wrong or Illegal and the Communist Scum that held him for Purely Political Posturing MUST ALL Be FIRED and Serve Prison Time for Violating his Constitutional Rights particularly 18 USC Sec. 242 "Deprivation of Rights under the color of Law" and he should Sue each and Every one of them Separately and in Every way he can. I Am SO Happy to hear this today and Thanks are Very deserving for Mr. Lindell and Mr. Schroder so ---------- THANK YOU BOTH AND EVERYONE ELSE INCLUDING KYLE'S LAWYER!!
Let's hope our new president puts this trash back in the bin where it belongs!
2 million dollars for defending your own life. nice
What kind of law allows a 17 yrs old carrying a rifle without any consequences? Out of control.
That's what white people always say!!!
Are you kidding me
Outstanding !!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing the right thing. Sticking up for your community against paid thugs could not have been easy. You are a trifecta rock star. Good luck and keep your powder dry. When is the book coming out?
There was a curfew, he shouldn't have been  there in the first place. And now there are reasons to believe the gun he had was illegal. You don't get to murder people just because you have a gun and feel 'threatened'.
"Hello this is Michael Lindell, and I'm here too make sure Kyle Rittenhouse get's the best sleep of his life, with MyPillow"
the pillow i lay my head on at night  is not blood soaked or cowardly or criminal and not a soul i know would purchase one that was.. as in "my pillow"
Sorry, but what is particularly annoying is that " jailhouse " picture that looks like all three...men(?) were released after 24 hours because the homeowner who's house they t.p.ed isn't pressing charges after all. They look like they are about to rejoin a party.
There it is! Racism at its finest!! Don’t get mad then when people protest the injustice!!! Don’t spew your theory for self defense either!!
Look at the amount of likes and dislikes and you can see how the presidential election votes should’ve went if the Democrats didn’t cheat
I mean, how can we be surprised right? I expected this. Even if bail was set higher, bail would have been met regardless.
A murderer walking free for everyone to see. I guess thats the kind of "rule of law" the west preaches to everyone else around the world.
#SelfDefense
He acted in self defense.  Fact.  Go watch the video.  Any semi-competent defense lawyer will have a field day poking holes in prosecution's charges.
Wow this kid is crazy and dangerous and should be locked up the rest of his life!!!!
Not my Pillow!
I saw no weapons in the arms of the protestors especially the 2 he shot and killed. He's a teen with virual no life experience to be carrying an automatic weapon in public to help people. I'm for the 2nd amendment as I have my own pistol and rifle but have no need to carry one in public to help people. This is the job for policemen and EMT's not a unexperienced untrained teen.
The wheels stop but the rims keep spinning!
WTF?!? Why in God’s green earth would anyone back and support someone who committed such a heinous crime only to try to claim selfdefense?!   That is insulting on so many levels that I can’t list. I could swallow people calling for the public to possibly pause judgment if there was reason to believe rittenhouse had not committed these crimes. But this fool is on camera and gave a statement to police. So please explain which of his many idiotic, narrow minded actions are worth supporting or defending?!   I’m willing to bet vital parts of my body that if any of his victims were known to either of these men, they would not be sitting there getting him out of jail and posing for some warm and fuzzy pics!
Bruh imagine helping a murderer
i use to hear the pillow guy on radio infomercials for years while listening to talk radio. never convinced me to buy one of his pillows.
So can he give me some money too since he is putting millions of dollars on the line for murderers ????
Commies are big mad right now. Just chill, that was only one 17 year old. 😂
Good. Perhaps it will teach domestic terrorist groups like ANTIFA and BLM a lesson
Kyle is a hero and defended himself against scum of society and got some bad people off the streets
You can get rid of trump, but you can’t get rid of stupid.
Alpha male Kyle Rittenhouse mowing down flabby titted beta males everywhere he goes!
RUN dude. I'll help you.
He WAS acting in self defense.  We get to defend ourselves in  🇺🇸🇺🇸AMERICA🇺🇸🇺🇸 💥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💥 🇺🇸💥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💥🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸💥🇺🇸🇺🇸💥🇺🇸🇺🇸
wow if he dissappears they lose that money i wonder 3 birds.
My pillow are yucky...bought one and it is awful so I gave it to my dog in his dog house...lol
9.7k likes vs 4.7k dislikes yet the baby killers say Trump lost the election.
Worst pillows ever.  Foam cut up in triangles.  So lumpy and bumpy.
It was clearly self defense.  Don’t try to hurt a guy with a gun, and he won’t have to shoot you!  The organizers of that riot should get charged as well!
I have no idea what mypillow is but I assume is anime Wifu pillows
Only trump supporters can get away with killing anything that is not white. Look at the people he has granted clemency to.
Anyone who helped with his bail might as well have pulled the trigger themselves.
"The guy who killed 2 man in protest" YOU FORGOT TO ADD A LITTLE SOMETHING, JUST A LITTLE FACT THAT, A LITTLE MENTION THAT HE WAS DOWNED ARMED AND YELLING "STAAAAY BACK" AND ONE OF THE IMBECILES TRIED TO PULL A PISTOL ON HIM! JUST A LITTLE DAILY BIAS OF CORRUPT MEDIA CORP
This is so scarey
American patriot and hero, illegally charged and held, posts the ridiculous bail, assigned by racist, moronic prosecutor and judge. GOD BLESS THAT KID!!! If you haven't watched all of the camera footage from that night, do yourself a favor.
Aaahh yes... the pillow guy! I saw him on FOX News once trying to sell me.
I think I will buy some pillows for Christmas presents
Who post that punk murderer s Bail???
this 17 year old went there to shoot somebody and that is what he did, now he can rot in jail but I'm sure he will score a pillow out of it, what a deal.
Ohhh only a white kid could get bailed out for millions for killing someone on tape
Man the judge is so stupid. I just looked it up you can own a gun while you have felony charges pending. This guy is going to end up shooting somebody else.
A real American hero
he killed innocent people ,and in between those innocent people they were protesting due to no one could hear their voices so this was their only way to get their voices heard by protesting, I hope that ugly un hearted kid pays for everything
Sick ...
I trust acerbic wit Jon Voight chipped in some shekels. What about the John Gielgud of our time  Scott Baio?
What a productive way to waste 2 million dollars when people are suffering everyday in this country for legitimate reasons.  Shame on every person who donated!
My pillow, is going to have a huge surplus of an inventory soon
Remember when OJ got off
ALL RITTENHOUSE DID WAS DEFEND HIMSELF FROM ATTACKING ANTIFA PEDOPHILES  WHO HAD GUNS COMING AFTER HIM.  IT WAS NICE TO SEE NICK SANDMAN SUE CNN  FOR OVER $100 MILLION AND WIN TOO.
According to the report, the third victim, proceeded to walk towards Kyle with his hands up, and our boy Kyle shot him in the arm. Yeah it totally makes sense that he fired out of self-defense. I believe him as much as I believe Jesus Christ walked on water.
Must be nice to be rich
Watched videos totally self defense
Great news!
He was probably safer on the inside my pillow guy.
HAHAHAHA
Thank god!!!
NOT GUILTY will be the verdict. Get used to it LIBERALS!
He's going to prison for a long time. You don't get to inject yourself into a volatile situation with a weapon and play like you are a soldier in wartime. Not in America!
Says a lot about my pillow guy.... never ever support his products again.
Self defense! I back you Kyle!!
he should of stayed home instead of going to a different city and taking a gun to a public gathering.
why are we letting terrorists post bail?
Eye for eye for the turd.
Truly a brave and courageous young man, defending himself against unarmed individuals with an assault rifle. I used to think 25% of the population was unfit to live in society, now I believe that to be about 45%
Put him back in,he's NO hero...he was the perpetrator
As you can see by the comments, the loyalists to Britain have never left.
Must be nice to be white in America and get away with murder
To be 'fair and balanced', instead of showing pictures of Kyle walking with his friend earlier that night, why don't you show him when he was all alone being chased by a mob and had three men, adults, chasing him.... what are adults doing chasing minors? I know that's illegal in a lot of States you can't even touch him...a minor. So  one was armed,  as a felon, trying to take harm Kyle ...it is on tape! So ...because there are pictures of that and you have access to that too ....tell the whole story you have it in pictures . 'Fair and balanced' 😅😳
I will never buy a pillow from the my pillow guy
My pillow sales go threw the roof.
0:21 this SCREAMS "self defense".  Lets send a BLACK man into a white-collar crime infested WHITE neighborhood with a machine gun AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO....... NEVER MIND, NO, DO NOT DO THAT!!!!!!!
I’m h Going to buy a pillow for everyone in my family! A real American! I’m beside my self, what a great patriot and good man!
Nice, glad he's out
I saw the video it was self defense . R.I.P to the people that died it’s sad what happened
This is nothing compared to the central park rapists being let out of prison and given millions$$$$  EFFF  those rapists!!!
Nick Sandmann is now a millionaire...soon...Kyle Rittenhouse will be a millionaire...
Lol
I actually feel I have to 👍 this video because despite the pre-judgement the owners of this channel have probably made, the wording of the presentation here was surprisingly factual.
Kyle will come in handy once the communist mob really gets going again. I say get him a night site and plenty of ammo.
When will the insanity stop.....I will never buy another pillow from that creep
Black people, if you defend a business from violent criminal vandalizing protesters, justice will be on your side. This imaginative conclusion of prosecution is BS. stand up to injustice be proud of yourself knowing this is right, this is justice
committed multiple felonies before the murders Conservatist see him as a Hero
Kyle Rittenhouse, a true American hero.
Are there any links to donate to Kyles legal defense fund? And also, links for the victims too?
FREED, finnaly,He never deserved to be sent there
The law is the law. Why are people shocked? He was held at bail and got bailed out. That's the legal process. Its kinda like when Biden's campaign bailed out the rioters, looters, and murderers this summer.
WTF
Speechless
Oh boy if he was an African American.
Too bad Wisconsin does not have the death penalty.  I'd volunteer to throw the switch for free.  It’s also too bad the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed executing juvenile killers.  The age should be lowered to 16.
wow trash people helping trash people that support a trash president
He'll probably get killed by someone anyway, who cares, he was probably better off in jail
Weapons should be to protect your home. bringing a weapon like that is instigating violence.
👆🏼....Schroeder 💩
Self defense is when your life is in danger. Not running from people who want to disarm you after shooting someone in the head. The video has proven they say get his gun ! After you ran away after killing the first person.  The Courts will decide.
Self defense? He's the one that went there with the gun! trump told him to! Chalk it up to their leader. Leading them to their own demise!
Time to buy a few my pillows
At least kyle won't have to be a pillow biter anymore
this anime is getting weird
This right here....tsk
It was self defense.
Sickening,,,If this kid was black the my pillow guy would be the last person to bail them out. Absolutely pathetic.
Anyone who actually watched the video knows for a fact he was acting in self defense.
Not a protest. ...full on riot .  Ricky Schroeder! Bro thank you.... I forgive you for Silver Spoons...we are good .
It’s a travesty that he has been in jail all this time! Clearly a case of self defense! If the Bureaucrats in these cities would get these insurgents off the streets, things like this wouldn’t happen! We have a right to protect ourselves and property!
Good he was defending himself
I guess they're right. Being a child star does screw you up in all kinds of ways forever.
2 million dollars Bail is a ridiculous amount. The Judge is a Biased Liberal.
Taking note, Black Rifle Coffee, Michael Lindell, My Pillow, Rick Schroeder, murder supporters. There will be a price to pay.
Why do people support this murdering coplicking coward?
Keep your rifle by your side!!!!!  The second you point a gun at a person with ill intent you lose your right to life. Plain and simple. Good luck Kyle I hope the jury uses just the facts.
I think its safe to say if you saw a guy walking around with an AR 15 The best possible thing to do is not try to jump him. If you do decide to jump him don't be shocked when he shoots you !!!
God Bless the True Patriots, Michael Lindell and Ricky Schroeder for posting the Bail that brought Kyle RITTENHOUSE HOME!!!  NYC loves you!🇺🇸🤘
Just in time for the next protest
Thank U Michael and Rick!  Great 2 C Kyle where he needs 2 B, Out and Free!  Young Man Hero!  Time 2 Arrest the Real Criminals!
He should have never been arrested.
I guess even 1st degree murderers deserve bail.
Enjoy your time out of jail while you can, Kyle.
Will never ever buy a pillow from that dude then.
Yes! FREE KYLE TRUMP #2020
Where are those who burned our cities? Dam liberals are the real criminals!
Kyle name is being smeared as a murder is outrageous!
Long live Kyle!👍
Kenosha kid!!!
That's it silver spoons is going down and forget the pillows I don't use them.
He was acting in self-defense! Millions of people saw the scene, but that will make little difference in a country ran the same a Communist China! We do not have honest justice anymore, thanks to the Godless Liberal Democrats.  Power is centered in the ability to indoctrinate weak minds.   The proof of this is the coup against Trump and before that the corruption of government by Obama and Hillary. No justice there!   Judges are biased because they do not have any decency or honesty. The Media has become the propaganda machine for the corrupt Democrats.  They are the lap dogs with their tongues hanging out for a treat. Most of the people in America, especially the women, do not even care that their minds are controlled by the master liars in the Media.
Ricky is another has been, who has no clue what he was doing.
There is hope yet! God bless them
This man killed people 🤣😂
If he had any melanin he'd still be in jail.
“Nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.” ... The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”
The pic with Rittenhouse, lindell, and Schroeder looks like a mayonnaise and sourdough sandwich
I will be throwing out the 2 pillows I purchased from this guy!   I cannot allow my head to touch any product created from someone w/his immoral causes.
if he was black he would be sentenced to life no hesitation
We all knew he would make bail. But I wonder if it was me that did that. Would George Lopez and Mario Lopez bail me out? George would be like " Bail u out estas Loco bail u out"..  Lol.
Lame, should not be allowed to post bail
Meaningful Christmas gifts= my pillow
YEAHHHH
Today, why do you hate the color white so much? Especially W police...You ignore every B on B crime, Antifa crime, burning, looting, BLM, etc....while highlighting the very rare W on B killing....You are so biased you make Fox News look unbiased....DEFUND THE MEDIA
Ricky Schroder, I just lost any respect I had for you! And, I just threw my two "my pillows" in the garbage! Nothing like a couple of Trump loving racist's, coming to the rescue of a little mini racist! Kyle's mother should be held responsible, too! 🖕
Well I won’t be buying anymore of those pillows.
Hopefully, when this comes to trial, it will be FAIR and conducted according to the law. Then the kid can go back to as much of his former life as possible.  How many would argue that the Precedent that would be set by a Guilty Verdict would be Disastrous to any citizen ever forced to defend themselves.  Imagine the choice.. "I die here and now by this criminal's hand or I die tomorrow by the state executioner"
TODAY SHOW IS TRASH. OF COURSE IT WAS SELF DEFENSE
That isn't a claim... that was straight up self defense.
I was going to be surprised that a guy that sells pillows, and by an extension pillow cases, supports the kkk... but who else would buy his extra pillow cases? Gotta make those kkk hoods somehow. Legit found their klan hood supplier.
That young man better be very careful where he goes. There’s no doubt a lot of people want to teach him and his supporters a lesson.
brb on my way to buy a my pillow
wym claimed? they tried to attack him lol. just charge him with possesion of a firearm bc hes too young but still
Innocent !!!
my pillow guy smokes crack
I want to say this but Ricky schroder I've seen his show silver spoons honestly and truly I think he is a has been just like Kirk Cameron and I'm only 35 years old and I watched his shows when I was four
As blm & antifa like to say.. He was just taking out the garbage.
Why did they bail him out ? Should leave him locked up.
Gun advocates want an acquittal, it hurts their case for (THE STUPIDITY of) open carry. And please note these open carry idiots are usually sticking their gun barrels into events that aren't even in their city, like Kyle. He didn't go to protect, he went to agitate. If you protect you stay in your town.
There's video evidence HE WAS acting in self defense! But the RAG Today show doesn't want you to know that part!
First degree homicide is such a farce it shows how broken the court system is that they would even try to charge him with that.
How can you be acting in self defense if you leave your home armed with an assault rifle?
white male privilege  is real
Ridiculous !   He is an Illegal  Vigilante who KILLED 2 UNARMED MEN, and injured another.  HOW IS THAT SELF DEFENSE ?
Good to see the Kid Kyle out for now and soon i hope forever. It was self Defence. Sad is the County and State has yet to charge the criminal shot in the arm and i want to know why. It was Illegal for him to have the gun let alone threaten Kyles life
Hopefully he goes right back in after his trial.
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them✌️
if you murder someone and claim allegiance to white nationalism, all is forgiven. That is not America!
Thanks my pillow guy.  💝
He can post bail as any other person. He's guilty though. You can't illegally wield a weapon, cross state borders, antagonize ppl and then claim self defense when they try to disarm you.
All self defense...FACTS
those white nationalist look out for eachother
How did Ricky Schroeder become a Nazi? Oh.
make sense..you can use a pillow as silencer..this kid would show up in the next commercial
wow, posing with a murderer
Count 1: First degree Reckless homicide, use of dangerous weapon. Count 2: First degree Recklessly endangering safety, use of dangerous weapon. Count 3: First degree  intentional homicide.  Why would the my pillow guy bail this murderer out of jail? He was safer behind bars. Read the full report here -> https://patch.com/illinois/grayslake/court-documents-detail-rittenhouse-charges
WHY DID HE GET BAIL OPTION AT ALL ? HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE ?
This is so wrong guys
Disgusting
Claims he was acting in self defense? It was all on video, he was acting in self defense.
Kyle took out the trash
This comments thread is disgusting
Kyle will be shooting all over the place as soon as they start passing him around in the prison showers.
Two degenerates killed in self defense and America is a better place because of it.
I never like the show Silver Spoons , does it even comes on anymore?👎
So the my pillow putz and a washed up has been bailed uot a racist murderer
i'm glad to see someone help this kid that has the means to do so. I was afraid he'd be abandoned and railroaded.
Kyle Rittenhouse was protecting himself. He should have never been charged with anything.
I do love how this white kid can carry an AR-15 & walk around cops yet if I were to or any other minority, there’d be immediate screaming or shooting at us...  lmao he literally killed people and then walked passed an armament of police and they were like cool.
Guy has gun. Gets jumped by rioters with guns. Guy defends himself and his life. USA Today calls him a murder suspect while he obviously just defended himself.
Good job Kyle.
What kind of a world are we living in, when "Christians" flock their support around a mass murderer.
So what? How many looters, beaters, and arsonist , have been bailed out by leftist, such as hollywood elites and Democrat leaders ? Good for "my pillow" guy. Buying 10 pillows tomorrow.
If the guy was black he would have stayed in jail !
@Ragnar L Stand Down Dump Boy! I Don't follow Groups of Nonsense or Ignorance. You have your people Confused
DOWN WITH THE FASCIST NAZI LEFT WING!!!
Wisconsin is the most racist state.. the cops in forest county wi are a bunch of kkk members with badges
Mass murderer will be My Pillow guys “POOL BOY”.
Cash Bail is the dumbest system the US still implements
STAY STRONG KYLE!! JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL!!!! NOTHING A DEMOCRAT WOULD EVER DO!! KEEP THEM GUNS CLEAN, NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'LL HAVE TO USE. TRUMP IS OUR PRES. 2020.LOVE LIVE DEMOCRACY..... HOLD THE LINE!!!!
I just threw away "my pillow" and I am sorry I every bought that item and I canceled  my order for the pet accessories 🤨
Good. Knew it was only a matter of time.
The criminal Joseph Rosenbaum was released from prison as part of this whole scandal to provide rioters to join Antifa. Remember the ban on mugshots that happened before. These politicians need to go to prison themselves who were part of this.
They were not Jacob blake protestors, they were jacob blake rioters and looters.
based
He should’ve never gotten bail. Hope they keep close tab on this little brat. Otherwise the the right wing radicals will get him out of the country as dishonest as they are.
Play stupid games win stupid prizes! Let’s go Kyle!
Justice Prevails
my pillow guy? lmao. probably a predator.
Whoa
Boycott my pillow products!!
What a joke...
5 shots is not self defense. A shot in the back is not self defense.
Well guaranteed I won't be buying any MYpillows.
YOU FORGOT TO MENTION THE TWO PEOPLE HE KILLED WERE ASSAULTING HIM.  CONTINUOUSLY. THEY SAW HE HAD A GUN, AND THEY STILL CONTINUED TO ASSAULT HIM. AND HE HAD EVERY RIGHT TO DEFEND HIMSELF.
He needs to be in jail!
Kid's a stone cold killer!
How anyone can support a teenager picking up an assault rifle and getting in the middle of this whole thing is beyond me, regardless of your politics. All you Rittenhouse supporters make me sick. I feel sorry for your children.
White folks do whatever they want in this country.
My pillow guy is a crackhead
Who wants to chip for a bounty on this punk? Let’s add Ricky and the pillow guy to the wanted poster.
A good day for freedom! Stay strong America, we will win!
Dem Mich Mayor on payroll of DOMINION. Well isn’t that a Hoot 🦉... https://parler.com/post/a2e605d443a040f68ecf0e64bb44ef72
Time for a new pillow. A my pillow
I'll find your address Mike. Let's see that tough guy attitude when you don't have the choice
This is America. You can shoot at people with a gun you have illegally after provoking people, and people on the internet will defend you for it as long as you're white. Gotta love this country.
Mike lindell is a coward and a punk bitc
This is disgusting.
I hope the charges get dropped. He was trying to help people but the left wanted to attack him.
Hes gonna be somebody girlfriend in prison......
Damnit, now I have to go by a my pillow
So sad!
Disgusting!
He shouldn't smoke, he's not of age; yet he does. Now his life is a growing cancer on our democracy.  Polyps are Surgically removable. like a typical wart: they too fall off if you apply the right medication.
Time for me to order a few My Pillows.
Awesome ..was self defense anyways .. BLM and antifa cannot be allowed to just run around and attack people..pretty sad the news acts like those two groups are heroes or something.smh...if some guy came running trying to hit me with a skateboard I'd shoot em also!
Look at all these white supremacists celebrating in the comments.  The kid is a murderer, you morons.
Hallejujah! Kyle was NOT a free booting LOOTER! He tried to PROTECT himself and others from outrageous violence!
Going to go buy MyPillow, right now!!
Justice! They deserved the bullets. Act like an animal... Die. Plain and simple  Those idiots will learn eventually
Holy.. can’t stand these people!  This is SO SIMPLE... what would you do if it was you??!!    ... exactly my point.
He should get the death penalty
Just another moron who thinks he knows how to use a gun.
"Birds of a feather....".  And, this is how they get away with it folks.
Michael who? Thought that guy was dead.
This is NOT over I'm pretty sure President Biden is gonna do what it takes to put this Monster back behind bars where he belongs 🙂so enjoy your freedom for now kid because you WILL be put away forever, you owe it to the grieving families of these innocent people you killed, You have NO respect from me what's so ever.
Thankyou Mike
We live in a society
National Hero
Bye bye My pillow company....Purple pillow is better anyways....It was up in the air about which one to get. Now I know!
should be my racist pillow
The left will be outraged.  Nevermind that Biden's staff sprung rioters, looters and criminals.  Crickets.  So the outrage from our communist countrymen will be to deaf ears.
No orange moron to protect him now.
If this guy and Martin Skireli were in a fight, I'd root for Skireli.
He should not be out of jail. This is a bad dude.
Wow look at how happy Kyle is, almost like he feels no guilt whatsoever for his actions. People died, but oh well I guess.
Follow luxurystreetmusic on Instagram
Wonderful! Kyle is innocent and a hero that stood up as a man should. Marxist mobs chased him down, attempted to murder him, and forced his hand. It is an utter crime and disgrace that he was even arrested. Shame on the prosecutors and law enforcement for charging and arresting him. Nothing but tax-dollar-collecting redcoats. This is what happens when Marxism (cultural cancer) is allowed to proliferate. Interestingly, none of the criminals that tried to murder him, incl. the one that chased him down and pointed a loaded handgun at his head—right before justifiably losing his right bicep—were charged. At all. Communism, leftism, has no place in our constitutional Republic. Gtfooh.
Kyle is a hero..thank you Ricky Schroeder .. at least some Hollywood people still have a brain
Bring back silver spoons. I will watch it on my pillow. Good work.
I hope he has body guards or something... he was probably safer in jail
when you let a domestic terrorist go home as a 'hero' to those on the right, you make certain the copycats will see what they have to do to bring  'meaning' to their meaningless lives.
I am happy for him
Self Defense is not murder.  Crush Antifa.
Wow
He's gonna be biting a 'my pillow' in his prison cell...that's the 'my pillow' guarantee
I want 315,000 views just reading the title of my video
I am so disgusted by this. He made a conscious choice to buy a military style weapon and insert himself as judge and juror . I see conservative groups making him a hero and once again the complete two tiered system is apparent. White kid murders someone and it is self defense. Black woman murdered while she sleeps- her fault for  having a scummy ex. Man dies with a knee to his neck- well he may of had a counterfeit bill. Wonder why we march?
Oh wow terrorist released on bail. What a safe country.
That my pillow guy is definitely the creepiest man alive 2020 winner
you want vigilantes deciding in the street who will live and who will die, expect the end of our country then.
People should put my pillow out of business ....
HERO!
So Awesome! glad he's out.
God Bless these two MEN for being patriots for the cause.
This kid was looking for war when he killed and shot protesters he made the decision of following white supremacist idk how you characterize him but should go to juvie till 18 and do at least a year in prison and 2 years of probation
.......well.....hope the My Pillow dude is ready for his company to tank. The leftists will never forgive him.
American justice is the exact opposite of private citizens deciding to murder people to show their power.
I'm sure the families of the men KILLED by this irresponsible, gung -ho, gun obsessed kid aren't smiling.  He has absolutely no reference to the pain and grief he has caused.  He was not playing a video game!  He is only worried about saving his own skin.  He is 17, why and the world would his parents allow him to be there.  This is disgusting.
I will never buy 1 of those pillow or any other of his products.
Justice for Kyle!!! My Hero!!!!!
The dysfunction of conservatism is clear... They are murderous evil.
Ricky Schroeder has $
We got your back, brother!
The Kenosha Kid rides again!
F**K all three of those weirdos....and whoever gave an illegal firearm to a minor to commit murder should ALSO be indicted as an accessory to murder.
Good on him. Sad that USA Today is still trying to make a person defending themselves from being attacked by the leftist mob, out to be a bad guy.  #FreeKyle
just ordered a new pillow!
He's cute, I'm sure he'll be a hit in the big house.
i guess its okay to commit murder if your a white supremist in the Great Trump America.
Good on him. American hero
When you hit someone in the head with a skateboard that is holding a rifle , YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE!
i might have to buy a new pillow.
FIGHTBACK.LAW. You too can donate!!!
So can you claim self defense when you werent suppose to have a gun in the first place?
Just think about how many lives this young man SAVED from these terrorists!
Kyle doesn't deserve jail. Self defense shouldn't be punished.
You can't take the law into your own hands. He's definitely going to prison, not sure for how long, but people are dead because of him, so at least 10 years.
since when is bail a thing in a murder case?? america truly is a strange country.
VERY disappointed he was bailed out.  How could anyone think he wasn’t guilty of murder?  This is a straightforward case.  Shame on Pillow Guy and Silver Spoons dude.  😡
People trying to make this murderer a hero is proof of the stupidity of the masses.
Cmon they should just let him go, no trial no nothing. Streets are full of murderers like him and they are running loose blessed by the president of United States himself, why take it out on this one 🤷🏻‍♂️ let him go, let him go, let him go 💀
A psychopathic murderous little boy.
MY PILLOW is in the mail, yes!. How do we donate to Kyle's justified innocence case?
You can’t teach stupid people. So bye bye Stupid. Human killer
Gonna buy a my pillow.  Way to go dude!
`Maybe these rich idiots will fund his commissary fund for the next 40 years because he is guilty and will get convicted. I sus pect Bubba and Jethro will make him regret his stupid, underage decision the first week in prison.
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Not Kyle's fault that he was chased by so called 'protesters' and assaulted. Don't act stupid, don't tease the man with a gun.
A kid walking on the streets with a loaded weapon, what could've gone wrong?
2 words..... F'ing AWESOME
Premeditated ..the kid likes playing with guns ..running around the car tormenting people'  and mum drives him to another state to allow this to happen ..Are you kidding me , only in America...
I will never watch silver spoons again
no wonder dude needs a big gun. Look at him....haha, whadda goofy dork. :P
well get him don't worry
Tip: 98% of those commenting have no idea what really happened because of the main stream media hacks and feel enlightened for it.
GOOD!   ps. he helped a protester that was hurt with the first aid kit he brought with him
Rittenhouse is a hero to every white republican that never left their hometown.
this is America, vigilante justice will not stand. You can't arm yourself to enter a street protest after curfew, fire that gun, confront others in the street like you are a soldier and then claim 'I'm totally innocent'.
Is this like a happy story of justice, or...? Without the bias, its hard to tell. I wasnt there, idk what happened, just an observation. Whats the actual message they are trying to send with the bias? Injustice? Very confusing how posting bail can be so controversial...
He left jail then went and shot that mall up in Milwaukee.
Why was he even arrested?!
Kyle is a killer.
That is great Advertisement for my Pillow....... I made that mistake once, I won't ever by from his company again
Nothing like jailing another innocent citizen.
White people get lucky i swear.
Ricky Schroder helped to pay for Kyle's bail,....that's a Silver Spoon help. Perfect example of Social Darwinism,... not justice
Fu—ing unbelievable! I’m burning my pillow!!!
Peculiarly, it took the police how long to get around to arresting that little twerp? And then you a pillow mogul and a washed up child actor spring him from jail. When an adult left-leaning veteran shot 2 rightwing thugs in Portland, it took the police less than 24 hours to hunt him down and murder him in the next state.
Looked like self defense to me. Looked like they where trying to hurt him. That's what I seen on the video.
Well, i know a few more celebrities or business owners I won't be supporting in the future
Finally some good news, so glad he's out.
A big thanks to Mike L and Ricky S for standing up for Justice.
That kid doesn’t doesn’t deserve bail my god
wtf look at how happy they are that he took 2 souls away from this earth like wtf these people are sick
I can't wait until somebody drops one these "patriots" that go around messing with people, and they get to claim self defense and get off.
Good thing I haven't purchased a My Pillow - definitely won't now.
Kyle is a hero.
I would never buy one of his stinking pillows..
Bidens your president chill out.
That kids a hero! Plain and simple
It's straight up in the video, proof of self defense...  Glad the kid is out!
Rittenhouse is alive and well and the two ANTIFA felon-thugs who attacked him unprovoked are dead.  That's message the Left wants suppressed.
Not sure why he went to jail in the first place. I thought it was very clear it was a self defense scenario. He would probably be dead if he didn't shoot.
Boycott my pillow
This shooting is brought to you in part by, My Pillow. "My Pillow, how did we end up on the news?" and also possibly by Black Rifle Coffee Company. Its good a day in America when companies are now sponsoring murders, watch, their stock will spike a little and thousands of strategists will want in on it.
Look at these terrestrial cavemen.
Kyle had multiple chances of killing people and decided not to. THey chased him, ran him down, and pulled a gun on him.  Its self defense
Bruh
Go Trump 2020,
Fake news fake CV-19
I hope the best for Kyle!Either way he will be a changed man after taking human life,no matter how justified he may have been.
Next stimulus checks for your most needed guns
So are people giving likes cause kyle is out or dislikes for the news station
Thanks Ricky and Mike!
That kid is a killer.  He killed a human
Sales about to plummet smh. Outta all the people in jail you guys choose this clown.
Good! This kid who defended himself shouldn’t have sat in jail as long as he did!!
Kyle is her0
Kyle acted in self defence. Those who attacked him were not provoked.
100% Self defense.
THOSE PILLOWS ARE TERRIBLE, BTW. The owner is a BIG MORON supporter,  What a surprise! He's a filthy pos.
This is the kind of KKKid to go berserk and shoot up a milwaukee mall for his beloved president loosing.
I will never watch "Silver Spoons" ever again! Anyone who bought a "My Pillow" should demand their money back!
“Claims” self defense?  It’s all on video for the world to see. A real journalist would show you what happened. The kid protected his friends business then protected his own life.
my pillow's stock just plummeted
I've got a GoFUNDMe started to keep Kyle unemployed. Oh...and another one to stand in line to put a boot upside his backside.I have raised over 50k so far.
Nice logo on the tshirt . It’s ok for teenagers to roam the streets with riffles . The whole world is laughing at as ... TOO SAD
the pillow guy should make a kyle rittenhouse 5.56mm edition pillow and quote it "best sleep guaranteed, you won't ever wake up again"
Confucius say "If you go searching for trouble you will surely find it"
YEAAHHHHHH !!!! So happy for you kiddo !!!!! Your a real American hero
If Kyle was black he would've been denied bail
Just wait for the riots when this kid is found not guilty.
The kid does not deserve to be in jail. I witnessed all of the video from that night, and he was 100% acting in self defense. Anyone in their right mind would have done exactly what Kyle did that night. He should never have been charged. Good on Mike Lindell and Ricky Schroder for getting him out of there.
Good for them.  I think I will be buying everything I can from My Pillow.
The fact that they are smiling is disgusting asf your not only charged with murder but you actually did it on camera little 💩
What a smile after killing two people. What a America we living in
All he had to do was stay away instead of playing 'army man', he's going to prison for a very long time.
Got my AR to act in self defense! Just like POS Piggies with badges, officer Kylie says he is the law and order patriot! May lead be in his future...
Looks like I need to buy a My pillow now
So it's illegal for me to operate a tank. I take said tank to a protest full of people I am known to dislike. Someone throws a bag at my tank so I blow them up. This angers some people so I blow them up too.  Self defense of course. Using this analogy to highlight the absurdity of this supposed "self-defense" argument. If Kyle Rittenhouse had never left his State to come to mine with illegal weapons and start trouble there would be two more people alive today.
https://youtu.be/jOO2x9xJoI4 Here's your patriot Kyle Rittenhouse, lol don't think Mike Lindell ever stopped smoking that crack, 2020 people🤷‍♂️
I had a crush on Ricky Schroeder when Silver Spoons was on air, now I'm disgusted by him.
"Claims" self-defense vs "Video appears to show XXX acting in self-defense" if Rittenhouse were a liberal. Media are one-party propaganda whores.
So when black children get killed by stray  bullets from gang shootings the leftist  media doesn’t care.. but for this it’s all they talk about 😂
I'm headed to Texas from New Mexico to act in self-defense!
Disgraceful
What does being a Trump supporter have to do with anything?
DPW, lol.
"I am crossing state lines to act in self-defense!" Says the PERMANENTLY unemployed Kylie "I can't find no work" Wackenhouse.
YAAAY GOD IS AWESOME! GOD BLESS THIS POOR YOUNG MAN AFTER BEING ATTACKED THE WAY HE WAS BY CRIMINALS
Good luck My Pilliow as your company goes Bankrupt. Good luck finding work in the future Ricky.
I’ll never buy a pillow from that guy. And I’ll never watch/support anything having to do with Rick Schroeder ever again.   That young man knew what he was doing and wanted to be a vigilante. He wanted to get in on the action and he is NO patriot. A patriot HATES death, tries to save lives and bring about peaceful solutions that build and strengthen communities, not tear them down and destroy others.
My pillow's new poster boy. Kyle will be biting a lot of pillows in prison.
Why babies shouldn’t carry guns in the streets only warriors and those trained in weaponry
if youre mad he got bailed out you obviously dont know the full story. Rittenhouse is a patriot and a bigger man then any femocrat out there
Won't be long now
What happened that day was not this guy's fault. What he did was entirely in self-defense. He was there to protect and help the people who needed medical help.
He was driven by his mommy, across state lines with his brand new SEMI-AUTOMATIC weapon, that he bought with his GOVERNMENT STIMULUS CHECK to do what? To somehow “defend his fellow Americans” from....? His fellow Americans were hurt, angry and outraged participating in a civil gathering and expressing fury on property and in the streets. This gives the guy the right to rush down to the scene and exact his revenge by death?
Trump/Pence 2020!  Don Jr 2024!
Oooh 👀 So all I have to do is “act in self defense” praise a political party and I’ll get away with murder. Nice.
Thank god. He acted in self defense, it's clear as day, in every angle. Look up videos and you will see. Two men had guns on him and were about to execute him.
Good! That kid doesn't deserve to be in jail! If u think otherwise you haven't watched the ACTUAL footage - just taking your lead from the media🙄
Wooooooow, what a fvcking loser that company owner is. This is insane tbh... The kid is a criminal and a murderer and Republicans are worshiping this piece of trash.
The only fact is that if this spoiled brat stayed at home people would be alive today. Bad parenting, bad influence, poor laws and stupid people manipulated by corporate lobbying is why we are here today.
My pillow stocks plummeting.
Yes he was definitely acting in self-defense against criminals
Great, he should'nt be in jail for self defense!
Kyle Rittenhouse. American hero.
Duck today news.  Kyle defended himself.  Down vote and reported
Kyle - GOD's Rifleman of JUSTICE - GOD hates COMMUNISM and pedophilia
Yay! Great for Kyle!
lol he sponsoring black rifle too great job kyle freedom will prevail my man made some sponsors behind bars awesome to see
From the video it shows two people were attacking him
He should havebeen bailed out a long time ago. He would be dead if he had not defended himself. There's no doubt about it. The leftist media  is trying to make him the instigator of this incident. The films clearly show otherwise. Thanks for the My Pillow Guy and Ricky Schroeder  helping him out.
He was using his god given rights to defend himself
The my pillow guy lit 🔥
Never liked that pillow guy and Silver Spork Kid actor.
An American hero!!! God bless this Patriot, I hope he grows up to be a great leader.
2020 has become the 8th season of Game of Thrones. We didn't need it.
I hope he gets life in prison !!!
Kyle ANTIFA-TERRORIST SLAYER Rittenhouse
Kenosha: How two paths crossed in a fatal encounter that has divided the nation Search YouTube self defense my rear little girl with a gun run run turn shoot run run fall shoot shoot what would you do if you see some one with an AR shoot some one then run and fall at your feet
you don't get to go out of your way to get to a street protest when curfew had already been called, murder two people and claim 'I just felt fear for my life', nope, that is not American justice.
#FREEKYLE
kyle rittenhouse deserves to rot in jail
good job buying my pillow today
Sadly, there are still many in prison who simply can’t afford a few thousand dollars to get out on bail.
White privilege prevails again
Im Black and thats something Blm wouldn’t even do for their own 😢 I just know it.
Well, watch the news, and the left start threatening not to buy “ my pillow “ it’s sad, but the Rep, loves “ my pillow “ and we stand for justice and what’s right!
Children acting like big shots .....no guidance of any kind.  Sad really.
Kyle had protester with a pistol aimed at him, before shots fired, someone attacked him with a skateboard, he got pepper sprayed. Before any shots fired. Y'all need to dig deeper before just taking what people say or the news.
Thank GOD! Finally! The kid never should have been locked up in the first place
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkztEYUDPmA&ab_channel=TODAY
KYLE EXEMPLIFIES red state behavior. Those supporting the punk here are clearly from the "TAKING" states...nowhere near an ocean, nowhere near any good looking girls...RED states...where marrying cows is legal. What gives?
Praise JESUS
NATIONAL HERO!!!
Kid was defending himself, but a 17 year old with a rifle out in political protest playing GI joe is not a good thing. He's a stupid kid in that regard.
This racist trumpturd will be back in line for life in prison, soon after 1/20/21.
You don't want private citizens going into volatile situations with weapons made for war and thinking they're going to use their 'power' to make people obey them, that is what cops are for. He murdered two people, that doesn't go away no matter how much he claims he feared for his life.
Smh
Just because you have a rich friend doesnt mean your going to escape justice remember that, unless your OJ then you get a freebie!!!!!
I just cancelled my order for my pillows. I won't support someone's company that supports a murderer.
Came here to see tons of comments defending the murder of 2 unarmed people with an AR in public.  Wasn't disappointed in that respect.
I suddenly have the urge to buy a new pillow
I still dunno why they thought it was a good idea to give a teenager a AR.
Commenters here...in the minority...still! OH but good news...KYLE can't find work. I am on a mission to keep it this way. NO way to support himself...OH wait...he can move to a RED state, the TAKERS of America.
Has CNN claimed Kyle did mall shooting yet.....????
anyone seen the videos of people chasing him and then he shot once or twice and another guy shot 3 times after they went behind the suv? I have and the thing i take away from it is that kyle shouldn't have open carried a gun at his age and should have not gone into wisconsin protests without someone who could protect both him and others. he was there to help people, tried to put out an actual dumpster fire that rioters started and got mobbed for that. there is video of him running with a fire extinguisher before the shooting. Also, people need to understand that these were rioters, not protesters and definitely not peaceful protesters. these are people taking advantage of actual problems in our country. wake up and do your homework and make change, and don't get triggered from someone wanting you to check the facts.
Whether its child murderers or murderers who are children you can be glorified by the reich wing if you murder the right people.
I just threw my my pillow in the trash. No more Ricky Schroeder movies disgusting POS
So Ricky Schroder is a white supremacist!... okay!!!🤔
This boy should have been home and not carrying a weapon that he wasn't allowed to.  If he had been home this wouldn't have happened.  PS.. Schroder is a real weirdo.
So many uneducated people.
That's awesome! Good prevails!
I wish I had his address so I can go shake his hand and present him with a brand new AR
I think the my pillow guy Is doing meth again.
This kit is a good shot and a true American patriot! He will be ok.
He killed two people! What’s he grinning about?
When your ego is greater than your business sense...
It was self defense, people threw a molotov at him and then someone tried to wack him with a skateboard and the other guy had a handgun. Kyle was trying to run away before that and he turned himself in.
#KyleDinduNutinWrong fr though, he didn't
2nd Amendment
This case will be dismissed quickly. Why would people open fire, and then chase a person with an AR... Asking for it, and got.
This is just my opinion, If I see a guy with any type of gun I aint  trying  jump him.
It's not self defense when you cross state lines armed for a fight with a weapon made for war.
"He claims"...video proof you mean.
Disgusting.
When they show the film of him being attacked not once but several times.....one with a pistol aimed at him.....not guilty. 12 to 0.
BREAKING NEWS!! - A convicted child molester couldn't keep his hands off another child....And that child shot him dead.... No love lost here..... If the jury decides to try Kyle Rittenhouse guilty from protecting himself from a child molester.... Well, I guess we know how they feel about children being abused.... Antifa seems to collect the nations child molesters.....I wonder why????
"My pillow founder and Trump supporter" huh, all the relevant details there I see.
How does the identity of those who posted bail for young Mr. Rittenhouse, who did act in self-defense, matter in this news video?  How ready were you jerks to Identify the people who paid for the release of all the rioters, arsonists, looters and shooters in riots across urban America this past summer?  You can't be assymetrical about this....oh, wait....of course you can.....you're the loony-tunes leftist BS news media who forgot what objective journalism was as soon as your bank accounts increased.  You sure you don't have a Dominion bank account?  btw, MyPillow's business is going through the roof.  How's your TV news ratings doing?
My Pillow. Makers of Casket Pillows, cause no one living buys them. Sleep for eternity, in comfort, with the Rittenhouse Edition My Pillow.
*AS LONG AS I'M ALIVE, **MYPILLOW.COM** WILL NEVER BE BANKRUPT* God Bless America!!
Meanwhile terrorist flying the banner of the DNC walk free.  Good on Lindell for helping out here.
Sorry, Rittenhouse was illegally in possession of a gun. He was underage and shouldnt have had a gun in the first place.
A crack addict bailing out a murderer.  Trump's circle of disciples is making the devil jealous!!
He CLEARLY should be free anyway
This may be self defense but there should be consequences for the situation he put himself in.  The Trump rhetoric has consequences and I think people around this kid from whom he listened to are to blame as much as him.  This is really proof that there needs to be more restrictions on guns.  The culture of guns and violence is toxic in America and it is at its core.
Man this is unbelievable. In all aspects. Kid running around with an AR, takes it into a different state, kills people, gets locked up, post 2M bail from mypillow guy. Wtfffff
I’m boycotting my pillows. F$$k the Trump supporter founder and the fascist right wing cultist who support the claim of self defense and still label protesters who fight for racial equality commies, marxists and unpatriotic. All of you have failed the character test, judging from the comments here
Kyle is an underaged teenager illegally in possession of an automatic rifle who crossed STATE lines with the intent to shoot someone. regardless whether or not he had to defend himself he is still a CRIMINAL.
to all the racist idiots out there who are saying he was defending, I don't think a 17-year-old should carry a rifle at a protest. He is a murderer and should rot in jail.
pfff... please like ricky schroeder has any money!!! didn't he just get arrested for hitting his girl?
Wasn’t one of the guys Kyle shot a convicted child molestor
Acting in self defense.  How about killing on purpose.  Well will never buy those pillows and never see a movie from that actor.
GOOD FOR KYLE!!!🇺🇸👍
He should have gone for a speedy trial, so the liberals could convict him and then Trump could pardon him before he is out of office.
This is the definition of privileged
What do these same people think about black 17 year old carrying around unregistered guns to defend themselves?  Never remember media portraying them as heros
Threw “my pillow” out last year. No one should buy from this bag of 💩.....
I think that this boy should be in a facility for young people, somewhere he can learn wrong from right! He knew what he was doing! He should be judged for the crime he committed. He killed someone who was lovedby his mother and father and many other people 👭
Say it ain't so Rick. LoL
Lock him up!
Excuse me...I have to go burn the My Pillow I bought last month.
Shameful, shameful, shameful. Rittenhouse should rot in prison, Lindell and Schroder need to go far away and stay there.
Famous last words: bust on me ni**a.  2 mins later, hes got a bullet in his face
They hit him to the ground on the head with a skateboard, anything can be a deadly weapon and you can’t count on the aggressors to stop before you die which they shouldn’t have even started, Kyle is innocent, I’m not saying you deserve to die if you hit someone with a skateboard but you deserve to get shot of if words and reason won’t stop you which doesn’t work for stupid people which is most criminals and if they die then they die it’s unfortunate but the treat has to be stopped
The Right sure does love their terrorists.
Kyle “The Pillow Biter” Rittenhouse
Sad just a shame before God!!
MURDER????? VIDEO PROOF OF SELF DEFENSE SAYS OTHER WISE
MyPillow and BRCC right now: STONKs *insert thumbs up and STONKs meme*
Ok?  So how does his bail getting paid for by them, have anything to do with being a Trump supporter? Your show is poop because you sukport sleezy Joe
This is all a hot mess. TBH, I can't pick a side here. Do I pick the side of gun totters or a gang of thugs?
waste of 2 million dollars lmaoooo he still going to get charged
WOW America is so twisted.  This kid killed 2 people and he is treated like he did nothing or a hero.  Where is justice in all this.
Rick Schroeder hugging a murderer... way to bounce back, has-been.
Why are we glorifying this murderer?
My pillow ceo used to be a crack head this doesn’t surprise me
I guess it’s only justice when you look like him.  That’s the problem with these type of people in this country.  When you can’t rely on the justice system the end result is what we’ve been seeing.  Nobody ever really gets away tho in Gods eyes.  To call the wicked righteous is just as bad as calling the righteous wicked.  But if a so called Christian supports  these acts of injustice then there’s no way he has the love of God in him.  The righteous judge will return soon, I’ll be surprised if these people keep the same energy when he does.
We support you Kyle
He was CHASED by a MOB that ALL knew and SAW that he was carrying a rifle. The mob DIDN’T care and kept chasing him. THREE ADULTS that ALL ALSO knew that he was carrying a rifle. The three ADULTS that were CHASING HIM DIDN’T STOP and DIDN’T care.  At what point does taking personal responsibility for chasing a TEENAGER WITH A RIFLE start?  WHEN do the ADULTS have to ADMIT that they’d ALL be alive if .. they STOPPED chasing a teenager?! It’s already been proven that ALL three ADULTS made PHYSICAL contact with the teenager in the attempt to DISARM him! ONE of the ADULTS had a pistol! The TEEN tripped and fell - three ADULTS , one with a GUN lunged at him! After trying NUMEROUS times to get AWAY from the mob along with  THREE ADULTS ONE OF WHOM HAD A GUN! It was only AFTER the TEEN fell and THREE ADULTS lunged at him that he finally protected himself from HARM.💁‍♂️ Self defense is NEVER wrong.
I wonder how these good old boys would feel if Kyle was black and instead of shooting at peaceful black lives members he was shooting at proud boys members.
It's not self defense when you cross state lines armed for a fight with a weapon made for war, that legal strategy is not going to fly.
He just teenager didn’t need to be jail , with scary criminals
Can you imagine how differently this story would have been covered if Kyle was black?
Glad to hear that , now to get the charges dropped.
The kid did wrong but the men there did worse
Boycott MY PILLOW, he should have never gotten bailed out. He went of state lines to cause trouble. No one should feel sorry for his actions. He needs to accept the consequences.
I'm happy for Kyle!
A true American hero!!! He should be celebrated all over this country for his bravery and instead he’s slandered as a monster. But that’s only made him a martyr!
Clearly it was self-defense the question is the kid was not legally able to own the gun not to mention his bad parents that allowed him to be in that situation in the first place
This guy is a hero
Murderer + flight risk — what could possibly go wrong?
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3       PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
America,  where if you're white you can murderer 2 people on camera and they'll still say you're an "alleged murderer"
We love Kyle!
🇺🇸DROP THE CHARGES!🇺🇸FREE KENOSHA HERO PATRIOT🇺🇸KYLE RITTENHOUSE🇺🇸
Free Kyle hes being railroaded
So these two celebs love terrorists? Interesting that they are terrorist lovers.
This lunatic cant even wear a shirt without a "rifle" on it...
He took the law into his own hands when he shouldn't even have been there. Two people are dead because of his actions, the law can't just look away. He will be going to prison for at least 20 years.
you have to ASK "'WTF IS A 17 year old doing at a riot ? WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE ?/ THEY AUGHT to lock up his PARENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I've stop buying My Pillow a long time ago. The guys creepy.
I stand with Kyle
Wow so criminals can get away with murder if they are white... This child should have been at home doing homework not trotting a gun as big as him and crying he was a attacked when a plastic bag was thrown at him. Yeah i saw the videos, criminal should be behind bars where he belongs.
He's going to be a millionaire because the fake news tried to lie about him. Just like Nick Sandmann of Convington Catholic fame.
Its Good to be color white in America lol
mabe don’t run at a guy with an ar15 i’m sorry kyle had to bond out he should be payed
I am a firm believer in the 2nd Amendment as well as a law abiding citizen. The moment this young man carried his firearm across state lines he became a criminal.
This is gonna turn some heads
My pillow guy will have tons of new sales after all this.. smart guy
Kyle wasn't defending himself at riots, it was an "unrest".  Just a bunch of people grumpy because they didn't get a good nights sleep.
Here killer, have a pillow and some bail money.
We saw pictures. He was acting in self defense.
someone who knows his address should go take care of that kid
Dems thinks all guns should be out of the good guys, back in the hands of bad guys. This is great news, this is called self defense.
Disgusting
Im really liking this my pillow guy..... and he doesn’t just claim,   the video shows he acted in self defense
Not surprised considering how the news covered his “self defense”
Makes sense;  trump will pardon him in the next couple months while in lame duck status just to throw one last racial FU.. Watch and see.......
Kyle... cleaning up the streets of Kenosha by day and night.
This is good news . Rittenhouse was defending .
mike lindel here inventor of my pillow for just 2 installments of 1 million dollars ill bail you out of jail
It was clearly self defense! He was fighting off convicted felons!
If you view the video footage in it's ENTIRETY it is pretty clearly self-defense. If you don't think so, then you probably didn't see the footage I saw.
Vile. Absolutely vile.
Good. F**k BLM
You know what, I’m gunna go buy a my pillow...
the video says it all
They’ve already completely shown the video of the other shooter shooting at him first.
Hilarious to think about all the “my pillow” supporters who will wake up with jacked-up necks.
Not little Ricky schroder
I don’t understand, no matter what political side your on, that these people think it’s ok to murder and justify it.  There is no justification on this case.  He brought a gun to area that he had no reason to be there and shot people, period.  He is a murderer
Kyle will go away for a long time. No amount of “self defense” will protect him. He shot two unarmed people on video. Good luck being upset! Kyle is a very misled young man who will pay for his crimes.
And the convicted felon that assaulter Kyle with a pistol is still not charged with a crime.
US judicial system is a joke and that is why you see so many murder cases. You have to punish the criminal in order to stop the violence.  Where is the human right if murders get away with killings.
It's scary that he had a bail (and a million dollar one) when it was really clear that he acted in self defense
The Chad is loose among the virgins!!!! He did nothing wrong!!!!!!
...a hit piece targeting the guys who posted bail, disguised as a news blurb.
Good for Ricky, glad to see someone in Hollywood not afraid to stand up for what is right.....
the KENOSHA KID rides again a real american hero
Shoot 2 people dead.  Smile wide. America sucks
So what! Christy tiegen was bailing out looters back in June
he acted in self defense
Shame on America. Cancel my pillow and whoever this other guy is. #cancelmypillow #justicenotserved #americasucks
An M15 assault-rifle isn't a "self defense" weapon.  It's a weapon of war used for mowing people down.
New Ad for those pillow.  Guns and Pillows are essential. We here at My Pillow, support the 2nd amendment and the right to sleep soundly at night.
Stop giving terrorists bail.
Kyle is a Murderer. The first person he shot didn’t even know Kyle was there while he was aiming his firearm athim. His parents should be ashamed.
Not Efffing guilty people.
What did we learn from 2020? We should go broke and commit suicide over a virus. Use mail in voting to get anyone elected. And it’s illegal to defend yourself and businesses from hostile pedofile and felon rioters.
Terrible what they are doing to this young man for defending himself.
I'm glad I didn't buy nothing from him and I won't now. I'll pass this on. Why condone murder, that's stupid.
What monsters. This is disgusting. I'm a Trump supporter and this is horrible.
That's awesome.  It was time one of the wealthy republicans stepped up to help him.  Go My Pillow and Ricky Schroeder!!
what a g
My pillow guy? He does sound insane on adds. Guess he is.
he was protecting himself, free the man
scratch a Kyle lover and you'll find a racist underneath.
There’s over 73 million Kyles in this country so keep on pushing us and see what you get.
OK all you right wing lemmings, go buy a My Pillow to support your Nazi causes.
You have got to be kidding! Won’t be buying or watching anything these two have anything to do with. Doesn’t matter if you are Democrat or Republican, this is wrong on so many levels.
Unfortunately, the people he killed in cold blood don't get to post bail
White men can't protect themselves without firearms. Coward
Yaayy!! God bless the pillow guy and Ricky "Silver Spoons". 🇺🇸🎆⚖️
Go Michael Lindell!  I'm glad he helped this kid out, that was very nice.  2 million bail for Kyle, but all the BLM people walked free no matter what their crime (from burning down cities to wrecking statues to killing people).  There is still good in the world.  I'm sure Kyle will want to learn from all of this and just get on with his life now.
Bull💯
Good for him!
All of the stories of abused women who tried to get protection from an abuser from the system and were denied. Who then took weapons with them to confront their abusers where things went wrong and the woman killed or injured her abuser and those woman are in jail because the very fact that they brought a weapon with them meant they intended to do harm. Either let all those ladies go or put this kid in jail. Being a young white Trump supporter shouldn't get you special privileges.
He shouldn’t be in jail
There’s a bond on his head now
Truly amazing.  I was trying to donate money for his legal team but all channels were taken down. I hope all goes well for him
Yeah, & he's the one with the assault rifle. Of course, self-defense. No brainer. Instead of having better things to do, like skateboarding, this 17 y.o. kid decides that morning to grab some knockdown power & mow down protesters in the street.
My pillow guy gives me chomo vibes.
Sliver spoon actor, man he still has money from the 80's
Most people don't get an option for bail on murder charges . And dam silver spoon the irony is crazy .
Only one of them was a questionable murder. And its all going to come down to state law. The state where this happened doesnt not have a stand your ground law. Which means when he was running away and then turned to shoot the guy he just broke the law. If the state had a stand your ground law then he wouldnt have even been arrested.
Great news!!!
Thank God...its about time some justice is served.  BREAKING UKRAINE GOV JOE BIDEN AUDIO BURISMO, ROSEMOUNT SENACA,FRANKLIN TEMPLETON,13 BILLION MISSING,  SHARE.... Democrat Party heavily implicated most senators in our government
Kyle for Sheriff!
Get out of the country before Biden gets FRAUDnagurated into office.
WTF this kid literally went out of state to end up shooting two people and claim self defense! Brh shame on the people who posted his bond.
Good he defended himself imma go buy some MyPillows
He clearly was acting in self defense
Gross
Enablers.
I watched all of the footage of him shooting people, and none of them approached him first. He brought it for self defense but is not mature enough (he had the gun illegally, he was underage/a child) to understand what an actual threat is. He's just a dumb kid, but I know the Lord is coming with the unofficial justice this year so we'll see.
Condemning kyle's actions is not tantamount to approving of looting and burning. Approving of kyle's actions because you condemn looting and burning is insanely illogical.
Rittenhouse was defending himself, great to see him out. Plenty of video evidence to prove it.
Republicans set a killer free
So disappointing
This gives the same vibes as when that isis dad from Australia was teaching his kids to fight for isis. Kid was 17, no business being out in that, especially with a gun.
Self defense
Republicans, backing mass shooters as long as they're white since 2001.
Good, he did nothing wrong, and it was completely in self-defense.
Self defense is not a crime.
This is awesome.  He should have never been charged and arrested in the first place.  Even the cops who he turned himself in, said it was  self-defenses and to go on home.
Dude will be someone girlfriend pretty quick in prison...
Free my boy kyle!
Its not a claim idiots .  Kyle was chased and assaulted by criminal thugs. That's called self defense. Stop spinning your FAKE horse sh!#
Lol. Wonder how the Right would handle this if it was a black teen from Chicago that went to Milwaukee with an illegally bought rifle. Killed two white republicans and then claimed self defense? Just kidding, I already know. The cops would have shot him on sight before he could claim anything.
bro, what!?
AMERICAN HERO
Coup supporting racist murdering nonsense
This kid is now the leader of the FREE WORLD.. He did what millions more need to do if we want to keep the Constitution alive and defend its purpose.  We can't keep letting these idiots continue to lash out like little kids. Man Up America...God Bless Kyle..
Fantastic news.  Kyle is a hero.  Helping his community and people.  Great guy.
Lets not forget...the problem here lies with the democratic governor. He pulled the police back, allowing the mayhem, and rioting to ensue that terrible evening. If riots like that night were the norm, more regrettable accidents like this young man's predicament would be evident.
The same people who agree with this are george zimmerman supports. Claim this kid was defending himself just like you claim zimmerman was smh
Self defense fake news 😂 there's alot of us that have your back Kyle
I hope that kid gets life in prison!!!
he should go to a maga rally
This is why people say we should eat the rich.
They should've given him the electric chair
I think I'm going to go to a proud boys rally with my AR and shoot them and then claim self defense. We'll see if Ricky Schroder and Mike Lindell bail me out.
This is George Zimmerman all over again he won't serve any time
murder suspect? lol what
Friendly reminder if anyone is interested in supporting the #StopTheSteal movement - You can get 66% off your My Pillow Order using code RSBN (Right Side Broadcasting Network) for a limited time
This is terrible, how can you even get bailed out for 2 COUNTS OF MURDER
He should have never been in jail in the first place .SELF DEFENSE!!!!
My pillow will be out of business real soon and nobody cares about the other guy he's washed up anyway
Murderer
Why are they playing happy music like wtf this is not cool
Gross
This is one of  reasons I burned all of all my pillows and blankets,what disgrace this guy is
Good for him. He has the right to protect himself.
Wow. Thanks for letting me know what pillow to not buy now. This is so disgusting that people stand by a murderer
The pillow guy wants to try one out with Rittencoward 🤢
He killed a child Molester and a woman beater...hes kool in my book
Best advertising money ever spent. Lend several hundred thousand, see a spike in pillow sales, get your bail money back at some point.
I saw him getting bailed out from a mile away. Though I definitely didn't see the My Pillow guy doing it. Guess I'm not going to get a my pillow in my lifetime.
Great news !
Jacob blake riots. multiple officer injuries and fires set. Kenosha Kyle had to defend himself from a bunch of felons and pedophiles from beating him to death.
Good for this young man . He did nothing wrong but just protected himself from crazy antifas ! Wish u health in the future
Kyle Rittenhouse ran around with a riffle he had NO right to carry! He was illegally carrying that weapon! He was out past a curfew!  He brought himself in that situation!  He is not innocent!!!
gross
Finally the left gets what they wanted: Kyle Rittenhouse resting in peace.
PIGS
That sounds about white.
Teen charged with killing two commie felon pedophiles and disarming an antifa.
The courts do not want to send the signal that private citizens can take the law into their own hands and start murdering people 'to keep order', that is what cops are for. This boy is going away for a long time.
We are with Kyle and justice.
No pillow for me!
Good he protecting our country shouldn't even been arrested
Never bought one of those cheap made things and never will!!!
Kyle bought the rifle illegally and murdered two people punish him to the fullest extent of the law
You can’t legally defend yourself with an illegally purchased firearm. Kyle is going to face charges.
He’s a murderer WTF
well why not? My pillow guy got millions in the Pandemic relief fund from trump since he is a trump "fluffer"
💪💪💪💪💪👍👍👍
Kyle is a patriot, he drove across state lines to counter protest and exercise his right to safe defense against those that would do harm to this great country.
Good to know we shouldn't buy from Terrorist Pillows.
The real news is how does Rick Schroder still have money?
Armed civilian with illegal AR claiming self defense. Noice.
He should be free!  you play stupid games you win stupid prizes put yourself in his shoes what would you have done ? It's easy to judge when it's not you
I always cross state lines armed with assault rifles when I commit self defense.
The evil that you do stays with you he will carry this burden with him for the rest of his life he has not gotten away with anything he will be judged
Off to buy me some pillows
Nice!
I hope for the best for poor Kyle but with the Democrats in charge, I bet they will crucify him. In the media anyway. They will make an example with him to keep anyone else from standing up to them (aka Democrats).
YES  Wonderful to hear !! THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HELPED THIS INNOCENT CHILD ! God bless you 🙏🏼🇺🇸
Here we go again Democrat news Media pushing Narratives....Bloomberg paid Million to Ex Felon on the Fines...so they can Vote...you didn't hear that much Drama coming out of this Haters.
That murderer should be put in jail
My pillow just showed his true COLORS I wouldn't get one for free if he was given them away.
Harm Kyle and we will harm you.
KYLE SHOULD GET A MEDAL 🎖
typical. rick schroeder born with a “silver spoon”
You know theres something wrong when people consider you a hero for murder.
Can’t let buildings get hurt right? Go Killer Kyle. Lol.
We stand with Kyle
Imagine bringing a skateboard to a gun fight.
Unjustified
This is disgusting
Good for him
So many adults failed this teenager—his older friend, his older friends Dad, the Owners of the dealership, his Mom.  The Good Samaritans on both sides of the protest, who should have seen the teenager with a long gun and just taken him home.  Death and tragedy could have been averted that night.
"He claims he was acting in self defense." If anyone watches the video and does not see that this is a simple case of a kid being chased by a mob and that he only fired in self defense then they are liars. Why is the MSM railroading this kid?
Dam he might have to move out the country
{SIGH} 🤦🏻‍♀️
This poor kid acted in the exact manner that I would expect any red-blooded American to act! Thank you for your courage Kyle!
😲...😲👍🏽
MY PILLOW, NOW GETS MY BUSINESS FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well that means we can all get a k and go out and protest fully loaded just like him well that's okay with me I'm glad good for you good that we get to do the same thing so we'll be seeing you guys real soon
My Pillow is a proud supporter of domestic terrorism. Kind of like Bin Laden but with pillows.
LET'S GOOOO
if this was self defense like everybody says it was, please dont ruin this young mans life by sending him to prison forever.
Wearing a black rifle coffee tshirt
You deserve to be free , you were in a very bad situation. You’re lucky you are alive😉
This kid traveled from out of state with a loaded weapon to protect the cops lol?!! Please, little boy was clearly out for blood... doesn’t take rocket science to know that...
The case is cutting dry man it was self-defense. Anyone that thinks otherwise needs to re-watch that video. take in all the info we already know. Take a step back don't be biased and you'll come to that same conclusion
He was acting in self defense. Video proof.
White guys getting away with everything?
That’s a dam shame we two different justice systems in this country
Yes. Just in time for Trump's victory win. Eat that lefties. 🤣🤣🤣
Let them bear arms they said. Okay :)
WTF
The MY PILLOW GUY is offering free sheets will every pillow.
Kyle did absolutely nothing wrong. It was self defense as clear as day. If he's convicted of *anything* then he will be yet another example of our out of control "justice system" being swayed by the media and politics rather than the blind, equal treatment before the law we are supposed to have.
He murdered two people in cold blood. He had no right to be there. He was a juvenile, where were his parents? He's not a cop or a soldier who have the awesome power of killing people in certain situations, This vigilante doesn't have that power. He traveled to a city that he didn't even really know, he entered a volatile situation looking for trouble and found it.
I am very happy that people have stepped up to help this kid, after seeing several video's several times I agree it was self-defense from people that surely would have injured or killed him, they were screaming for him to be killed and I wouldn't take a threat like that lightly considering the terrorist acts they had been committing.  I hope he is acquitted on all charges and although it isn't my place I thank the people helping him.
The young man is innocent, if anybody attacks me I’m shooting you it’s just that simple.
I am so proud of this young man. He went to help a friend keep from having his business burned to the ground because the police wouldn't help. Hopefully, the A-Holes that put him in jail will drop the case after seeing all the evidence!
They better keep him in hiding
God bless you mike and god bless kyle
I seen the footage.. it does look like self-defense "BUT" what is a 17 year old doing from another state with a gun at a riot?!??! At the very least he should be charged with negligence and some sort of gun charge.. what a stupid kid and stupid parents for letting their kid go. just poor judgement all around.
The court & jury will settle it.
A good day for part justice.  Now arrest Joe Biden and his cartel and media whores.  Or we will.
Sadly ISIS is the only organization that has reached out to Kylie...
How was he able to buy a firearm at age 17?
So a shooter gets to walk free and people are actually happy about this? Edit; you people have some genuinely terrible defenses for this.
Murdering in the name of Donald J Trump? Intentional reckless homicide. Intentional reckless endangerment of others. Why did you have the gun? You are not old enough to own the gun. Who gave you the gun? Who gave you the ammunition? Who gave you and your weapon and ammunition assistance? Who are all of your co-conspirators? Why were you conspiring to recklessly endanger and harm others? I'm sorry but my opinion, fry in jail. I don't think the boy should ever walk free amongst we the people of the United States again. It was unnecessary to have a loaded firearm. It was unnecessary to point the loaded firearm at others. It was unnecessary to murder in the name of Donald J Trump. And I'm sorry however, I feel as though you ended your opportunities to be a civil outstanding young man when you decided to become a vigilante for a roofless dictator who wants you to murder in his name. Goodbye Kyle. I hope somebody loses the key to your path out of a life sentence in prison. Shine Brightly 🕺
Death penalty
Murder suspect? No wonder your losing ratings look how the news speaks of an American citizen who defended himself and tried to protect others. Enough with the bias news, they should be in jail for spreading false information 😠
Did I just watch an Onion newsbrief??
No law and order in Trump's America
So the leftist protected the thugs. No surprise.
Who would think the silver spoon kid was a racist POS..Wow
That’s awesome!!   I’m going to buy a pillow now!
my pillows in the trash
He's a hero and if you disagree you hate America.
Oh well not buying those pillows!!
he wasn't claiming self defense. it was self defense fake news. what would you have done if it was you? oh my bad you fake news have no common sense.
Looked like self defense to me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iryQSpxSlrg&t=29s
If you Google "Michael Lindell " you will find he's a Trumpublican to the hilt and a rabid Christian right-winger. Not surprised he bailed out this murderer.
Trump's America, sad
yep america is now a 3rd world country....MAGA...make america  gushing arteries
I'm glad this guy survived
Bottom line it's self-defense America says you have to right to defend yourself in the right to bear arms he was being attacked while he was retreating Justified
The kid deserves a medal, not prosocution.
WTF is this?  They are smiling and he killed people.  White people with their guns claiming self-defense from unarmed protesters.  This kid is getting jail time but not nearly as much as he deserves.
These two are more like pillow biters .
Bail ? Wtfreak , but you know what ?....Karma will get you later , for sure !!!
What happened to law and order?
American Hero. Deserves a medial .
This young man's life will never be the same,  sad
You can see in the video its self defense
To his Lawyers that like to Quote Scripture- " Get Behind Me Satin" Matt 16:23.
What was that first guys name Rosen something? Didn't he tell the kid to shoot him o yeah he called him the N-word! And what happened to the other criminal who got his arm shot off? Is he in jail? Out in the stick's want to know!
Of course he’s going to claim that it was self-defense. The people believing him are sooo dense. Put the pieces together- he drove out of state carrying an illegally owned rifle... for what? The intent to peacefully protest? He isn’t a cop. He isn’t allowed to just walk around openly with a rifle. His intent was to show up and do some damage because he is racist.
Wow. That guy is not mentally fit to be out on bail. A lost little boy mislead by the Republican Cult.
BAIL ON DOUBLE MURDER????
Excellent, Kid is true Patriot. He cleaned up more trash in one night than any Democrat has ever done in their entire life. Fawken Hero
You can see that in the video
Self-defense
That kid needs to be locked up forever
That’s a shame he’s a murderer; that’s okay because GOD sees and knows all things, he seems to be proud of what he did, he’ll get his , if not here on earth, his justice will be with GOD , and that’s going to be the worst ever.
Wow! The Rickster just ended his Hollywood resume. Brave guy.
meanwhile non violent drug offenders are still in jail 15-20 years later. spot the privilege
😲.....🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
So what these guys are saying, is that if someone shows up to a Trump rally heavily armed and kills a bunch of supporters, gets out of there and casually walks past the police that are obviously ok with it, it's ok so long as it looks like it's in "self-defense". Great precedence to set. Way to not look like terrorists.
“During the Jacob Blake riots”. I fixed it for you. This is why you get called fake news.
The only thing he should get in trouble for is not being a better shot. Should be 3 dead, not one and two wounded.
Good to know I will NEVER support the “my pillow”  company. I pray for justice!!!
Free Kyle rittenhouse!
This country is filled with white superamncy.... Its sad and no white person  is gonna do anything about it smh thats the sad part
He shouldn’t have been in jail to begin with
Amazing. But no need to say that he's a Trump supporter. Just adding fuel to the fire.
The rifle was bought by his mother
Why does him being a trump supporters have anything to do with helping post the kids bail? The mental tricks they try and play on people.
This is disgusting.
white privilege
He's lucky he has connections. I wouldn't of went to deal with BLM crap
This man is a LEGEND!!! BET NO ONE IS ASHAMED OF THE NAME KYLE NOW, YOU FKN KARENS!
Right-wing Domestic Terrorist
Does anybody actually think that it was a good idea for a seventeen year old kid to travel to another state armed with an assault rifle to protect property that wasn't even his?
Looks like 2020 has a happy ending after all
Some of my new heroes:  Michael Lindell, and Ricky Schroder.
LOL look at all these people being upset about Kyle Rittenhouse killing a child molester........ looks like i know who the pervert sympathizers are.
Good. He doesn't deserve to be in jail. Period.
Joe didn't win.
Wow! As long as you support trump the chump you can do whatever you want. Murder is murder, no matter who commits the crime. The two men that put up the 2 million are sick individuals, and have forgotten about the actions of a real president. trump is fake, and an enemy of the people. So is kyle.
Lol.
GOD BLESS.
He might escape our justice but I know somewhere he won't no body will remember your judgement is coming and when it does he will show no you who's laws count.
YES KING
Thank God he's out, finally some justice for Rittenhouse
Thank you Mike and Ricky for doing the right thing you are true patriots, I know the fight isn’t over but hopefully American patriots like yourselves will band together and do what we can and must do to keep Kyle and America free, God Bless You Both. 🇺🇸 TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸 YEEEAH 🇺🇸
Murderer.
He's going to get about 40 years in a very cold cell to think a lot about whether he should have injected himself into a street protest and pretend to be a soldier.
White privilege on display, no way this guy should be out in public he's a danger to society, boycott my pillow.
He would of been safer in jail, now there is a good chance he may be on the receiving end of "protection" ploy....
He claims...there is video evidence he was defending himself. Stop lying.
Send him to Afghanistan. OH WAIT...ONLY HEROES can join the military. HE's a loser...like RUMPY.
Republicans love their domestic terrorists.
WOW
People were attempting to disarm this killer, and they got shot and killed. He needs to go to prison for life.
Mike...I’m buying a pillow!!
Why all the smiles,a tragedy has taken place,wicked /
I hope he serves jail time
Great to see
This is nuts. Come on yall..lol
Yeah, that’s our boy.  Now let’s get him before a judge and jury.
OFFICER RITTENHOUSE is on patrol today! He thought the streets were a video game...so let's show him that justice is coming.
"He claims". The video made it obvious enough.  Why is it the 2015 riots were called "riots", but now media refuses to acknowledge it?
Self-defense for sure. Not sure about possession of an firearm under 21.
Why does Kyle rittenhouse look like  Gabe from good luck Charlie
I’m a democrat. I watched all the videos, It was self defense
i still dont understand, the video is 100 proof of self defense
Ran to a riot with a firearm and when someone tries to take it from you shoot them. Sounds like 100% probability
To be fair he should get the same amuont of time as if a black man shot someone in self defense with an illegally obtained assualt rifle. Which is about 15 years.
Everyone is saying how he is such a hero but yet he was out of place, a minor with an assault rifle and out after curfew. Let's just start there... How do you uphold one part of the law if you can't uphold the others!!!
reppin BRCC! noice
FREE KYLE
Good now drop the charges and give him his guns back 😀🇨🇱🌲🖕
Remember thisnis a 17 year old kid you are all talking about harming that yiu dont knwo the entire story we know he was being chase with a knife but your “tolerant and understanding?” Shut uour mouth open your ears listen to the defence another shooter was arrested do ur own research dont let mainstream media  ruin your lives an make you angry im beggin you people ti see the other side if the situation it has nothing to do with  color and everything to do with MORALITY
Innocent, God bless you Kyle.
I may just do a "Rittenhouse" JUST to be his cell mate...OH WHAT A PLAN!
Enjoy your freedom for its gong to end soon.
"Claims" ok anti-journalist
Wtf is happening to this country ? Nothing will surprise me for the rest of this year .
For his sake he better hope he gets off because he looks like he could survive about 5 minutes in prison before he ends up somebody's wife.
NO JOB for Kyle...tons of Kyles here today...unemployed...he better get a good attorney...but it looks like I may be on the jury...OOPS!
He doesnt need to "claim" he was acting in self defense. Everything is on video. He was acting in self defense.
So the guys that were killed were felons? One was convicted of molestation and the other of domestic abuse? Is this true?
Good
He should just run. He's becoming a political puppet, they'll destroy him. It was clearly self defense coming from a person who despises both sides.
Deplorable.
He went across state lines looking for trouble and murdered two people in cold blood. If he went there to bring order, he failed miserably. He's going to pay for many years to come.
Self defense . Support Kyle because he is a TRUE American Hero. Mainstream media is absolutely garbage
The videos clearly show self defense.
I am glad Kyle Rittenhouse is out of jail. People should be able to protect themselves against attackers in America, and he was clearly defending himself.
Y’all better but land grow your food guns  animals and stray away from urban areas.  We about to go back in time
hahahaha rich people think money and power block bullets. lol tell that to jfk, tupac, rockefellar, john lennon, and literally the creator of versace himself.  all those fools got capped and they're blood flowed out the same as any common folks would. take a lesson from the history books. doing anything of this nature is putting a target on your back. helping someone whos hated is going to make you someone who is hated. you are now guilty by association, as that is how the world will view it. ask yourself if that kinda heat is worth it.
good, the kid deserves to be free for self defence
Proof of a corrupted person living a lie to everyone as a KILLER of low intelligence and anybody that put money for him to get out of jail is just as bad as the kid killer himself as a praise his killings were justified which IS NOT. Kid is a stupid Trump Follower and killed for him.. 73 million people dont see the rest of America seeing them like 1930s Germans, when they followed a Killer in Wait and killed innocent people for their God, messiah, ect.. We do and are seeing the same prelude of them followers today along with the mis led folks who are siding on with groups like Taliban,Isis in them Militia groups that dont see the same image off them...That kid has some rough years ahead of him , for the worst.
All the "criminal loving wannabe rapper dirty gang banger" portion of society including child molesting Hollywood screaming and crying because Kyle put a bullet in two of "their kind." Good job Kyle, glad your out and I hope others will come to your aid a little quicker and in more numbers next time.
Drive twenty miles to a protest with a rifle and run the streets with it
Glad to hear
Crazy TDumpTard Lunatics raised the bond money to get this Mass-Murderer out of jail. SICKENING!!!
We all knew the My Pillow was full of crap. Good thing I haven't watched Ricky Schroeder in anything since that movie he did with Brad Pitt where they played brothers who ran track or something. Just shows how many people believe so strongly in white supremacy that they defend a teenager who murdered two white people that support Black Lives Matter. Can you be a worse person than defending a murderer because you don't respect the people he killed. I mean that's a pathological hatred. True colonizer mentality... Savage and disgusting.
Finally, this is great news!
Great kid in a bad situation. Would have been a lot more of these if the left exploded and Trump won. Good on those men for putting their money and reputations on the line for what's right.
Another confirmation
Justice
Y’all tripping. He should have never put himself in a situation where he felt like he needed to defend himself. You don’t go somewhere that you know is a “hostile situation” with a gun in hand and not have the slightest thought about whether you are gonna use it or not. Why bring it then? And why go? He could have easily not gone and those people would have still been alive. Stop defending this situation.
God bless America! Thanks Mike l. I’m surprised to see that Schroder has a set of brass ones on him. It’s going to be hard to get a job in Marxist Hollywoke after this buddy. Way to pull off the “Kenosha Hat Trick”. You BLM and Antifa cowards better stick to punching old folks in the back of the head. This needed to be done. I’m sorry it was left up to a 17 year old kid since the cops were told to stand by and make sure the looters could carry out unimpeded arson without interference. I’m not bagging on the police they take their orders from their top political puppet (The Chief). Thank God for the Sheriffs who answer to the will of the people.
Self defense!
May all his charges be dropped, God bless him.
Murder suspect???
If you're watching a protest on the t.v. from a different state and decide to travel across state lines to bring 'order' to the protest, like some lawless vigilante, you are definitely guilty of premeditated murder. You traveled far to find trouble and you found it.
WTF
What a waste of money
This sounds like a skit.
It’s amazing how partisan biases completely blind people from the facts. There are plenty of videos proving the shooting was in self defense, but that isn’t PC to say.
I need a my pillow!
So many crybaby anti-freedom liberasl on here commenting!
Anyone who cares about our 2a rights knows a minor owning and operating a a ar15 or any semiautomatic weapon is illegal. Making this thug a hero will result in more anti 2a Americans. Just remember when they outlaw our firearms like trump did bumpstocks and his atf are trying with braces.....its your fault. Y'all fake 2a activist.
THE PUNK will stay unemployed until I SAY so. I hope you all can pony up some duckets to keep him free...but it doesn't look good...he can't get a passport...join the military...go to college...unless it's online...dang...choices have consequences...poor Kyle...he made his bed...guilty or not? Doesn't matter...he's a POS and his life is over regardless.
People will still try to deny god is real. All this evil in the world and everything going on and you don’t realize? The devil is here. God is coming
I need a mypillow
Guess this was self defense as well   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKojeZZUKnA
LONG LIVE KYLE
This comment section does not disappoint
I'm glad people posted his bail. He was seen running and only fighting for his life. There were multiple people trying to hurt him and he was seen before hand trying to help people. He even tried to render aid to the first person he shot, who tried to throw a molotov cocktail at him. He even tried to turn himself into police that were there but later went home. This kid seems to be a good person and was there trying to help a business person who had already lost 2 of 3 businesses. Release him with no charges and charge the guy who was trying to shoot him with the glock, who said he regrets not emptying the magazine in kyle.
By Monday, this is going to be all over the news.
An incredible year hard to believe 2020 ever existed. Hope we don’t seee this year again going forward
Lindel is a god and Kyle too
Good for you.
How disgusting.
Good!
One of the hardest things for the Democrats, Republicans, Communists, Silicon Valley and the MSM to accept is that the American People don't need them at all. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights it contains provides all we need. Armed thugs looting, burning and assaulting private citizens (countenanced by totalitarian grifters or not) beware.
Wtf!?....
Republicans are traitors and terrorists and murderers and kidnappers of Democrat governors KKK
Guess whose sh*t I'm never buying!
Enjoy. You're goin' right back in!
Rittenhouse is a murdering little turd.  Jail coming soon enough.
Yay good for him! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🇺🇸
Trump tried to send in the national guard in the beginning and all the demonic, lefty, lunatic,  liberal leadership said no and told their police to stand down. This could've and should have been a voided.
Wont see pillow  man in Costco  again I hope.
He was within his rights
Awesome
Its gonna be all of you magatards fault when we’re either speaking Chinese or Russian in 5 years... cant accept that america is a land for all of us... the moment you let your OUTDATED racism fog your judgement... the donald is out... it’s over get over it... there’s literally a virus killing thousands of us on a daily and you think it’s a political hoax... the number of daily positive test and death numbers are as real as the election number’s... better think 🤔 about how your gonna keep your loved ones around and stop giving the commies a reason to think they can invade bc when they invade its not gonna matter if your a dem or rep... better figure it out before its too late
All these Rudy Guilliani will say anything to protect a killer, can OJ get the same love?? Asking for OJ
Why was he arrested again? Even pedophiles don't get 2 million dollars bail, DemocRATS are PURE EVIL. They wern't 2 men they were Rioters that were attempted to smash his face in with their boots and take his gun.
Awesome! Glad he has help.
Regardless of wether you believe he commited a murder or not, he’s still a 17 year old in possession of a firearm (and not just a pistol but a rifle). Regardless of wether he goes to jail for murder or not he will go to jail for unlawful possession at the very least.
Nice good job
What ingrates.
Glad he’s out. He never should of been in jail in first place. Those guys got what they deserved. Keep on fighting Kyle.
Oh wow he gone get his...
I'm buying some My Pillow products
Patriot!
YOU CANT STOP US!!!!!!
This pillow guy is a scam, with horrible reviews of his pillow. This is no surprise.
Didn’t know murderers could make bail...
Were those guys he killed even in the side of BLM? I heard the one guy was openly calling black people n word at the protest.
When a 17 year old brings a gun illegally but the guy you killed was a pedophile Both penalties off set first down
How has he been in jail this entire time with a 2 million dollar bail.? That was clearly self defense.
If you look at this guy. You can clearly see he has black heritage in HIM !!
We do need better control gun control in this country. Kyle demonstrated that when he shot a child molester and a wife beater. truly an brave American Hero. love the guy.
😮
The evidence suggests that Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self defense, thats why he can post bail.
Good for him
He was acting in self defense!!!
Glad he's free. Not a flight risk. Will stand trial and that's the way it works.
This kid was walking around with a loaded weapon he obtained illegally. Weren't the people he killed trying to disarm him? He wasn't even from Kenosha or Wisconsin. He's a murderer.
U.s justice won't work..... street justice will work.
How is it self defense if you drove to the riots with a gun. And your under age and can't even own a fire arm? Explain please America?
YESSSS HE IS FREE!!
Im buying my pillow right now
Im Glad he is home
This is beyond disgusting
Why am I not surprised!!! Not even a little bit
Interesting clothing choice 🙄😑
He’s white, underage and carrying a gun around at a protest and considered a hero. Yet if he was the same age and black, he would have been shot dead bc he would have been considered a “threat”. This kid deserves to spend the rest of his pathetic life rotting in prison. Maybe him and Trump can be bunk buddies 😉
https://youtu.be/Q5AvEmFPq1g  Rittenhouse shot someone at the car dealership first. That's why he was being chased. Rittenhouse should be charged with murder!
WHAT I JUST BOUGHT OF HIS PILLOW DO I HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY NOW.. WOW WOW
PEACE LOVE UNITY PROSPERITY CALM WISDOM HAPPINESS HONESTY
Trump needs to pardon him
simple logic, stay away from volatile street protests, use the gun at the practice range, don't think you can go to a very explosive situation and use your gun to bring order, you are not a cop or a soldier... you are going to be in prison for a very long time.
This is Broken Mirror Season 7
I hope he gets a chance to bag some more.
Time to add Mypillow to the list of companies that funded terrorists.
of course the white boy who murdered 2 people got out.
Another psycho incel and aging queen Ricky...
This is so sad, that a murder is being praised
Trump supporters are scum.  The help people get away with murder.
Consumer service worst rated product is my pillow it figures
GOOD...he shouldn't have been arrested in the first place....
QWHITE interesting ....
Free Kyle...shooting commies and pedos.
Just cuz he is white! That’s white privilege !!
THIS IS OUTRAGOUS !!!!!! SICK, SICK , SICK  !!! I HOPE HE GOES TO JAIL FOR LIFE !!!!!!
I will be buying a My Pillow now.  This is a wonderful thing this man did.  And he didnt ask any of the public to buy his product and he would donate a portion of the  proceeds like so many do.
People saying he's a murderer, do you know the full story or are you believing everything that the fake news media pumps into your brain to keep you slaves on the Democratic plantation? Trust me when I say there are a lot of Patriots right now who wouldn't mind seeing some of you leftist terrorists lying horizontal in the street after every unprovoked act of violence you've committed for months in this country.
I’m going to buy me another my pillow just because of this story that guy is awesome help him try to keep America great again
White people justice
Hearing set for December 3rd...I hope YOU all can afford his attorney...he can't find a job...
White privilege at its finest! This is insane.
My pillow will either loose business or gain business. Guess we'll see
2 million dollar bail?!? This case is exactly whats wrong with this country, people try to protect themselves from the mob and then get when them mob attacks and they get hurt they go after you for hurting them... That kid was cleaning graffiti off personal property earlier that day, what would you do if you were attacked by a mob for being a good person? Think about it, they attacked him with an AR-15 hanging from his neck, imagine what would've happened if he didn't have it, the mob had guns too by the way and one of the guys who got shot had his gun drawn before the first shot was fired...
This  kid never should have been locked up.
Wonderfull news ,this kid should be cleared of all charges ,it was self defense .
Glad he's out. You shouldn't go to jail for defending yourself.
I wished I was white y’all seem to get away with anything. If he was of color they would denied bail .
Absolute piece of garbage. Should have been thrown in a cell and the key tossed.
If politicians did their jobs with these violent protesters we would be here, peaceful is okay what they were doing is unacceptable.
Dawg what?? I thought I was having a stroke for a sec wtf did I just read?
He shouldn't have been locked up in the first lace. Self defense is self defense.  period
don't worry he will pull prison time for killing two people waiste of money
And people wonder why Christians are now considered a corrupt political group.  Hint: It's not the media.
Kudos to Mike Lindell and Rick Schroder!!! Way to help someone stand up against tyranny and thugism.
Good
That didn’t take long
Why are you still calling them protests ? They where riots
And " Trump supporter" okay labeling people on national TV by their political views is playing a dangerous game. You all are opening up a can of worms you don't even realize
I think it's good he got out to fight his case ,he is going to need to prepare himself for some prison time for murdering two unarmed men.
king
Why would the My Pillow Guy put a price on his own head? Rich dudes really get detached from reality.
He murdered two people with a rifle he wasn't supposed to have smh why did he even have  a bail?
He WAS acting in self defense.
True Patriots stood tall to help another patriot
Kyle is an immature little a$$hole . He obtained the gun illegally, went somewhere he had no business being, panicked and murdered someone. He doesn't even live in Wisconsin.
My respect for these people is now hivh
If I was in that situation I would do the same... try to push me on the curb or stump my head in your ( peacful protests) the lead will be waiting for you
Glad to see him out.
Looking at the comments, I don't think many people actually watched the videos of when the incident happened. You have to watch all of it, the moments before the shooting too. People seem to be parroting people that are trying to make you think differently than what actually happened. If you actually watch the videos (many different angles) you can plainly see the guys were attacking him before he even shot the gun.
An American hero is free!  Thank you all!
So the guy who was once attending and speaking at COVID-19 updates for Trump, and has a foundation in his name with a website address that does NOT take you to the foundation but to a self-aggrandizing PR page instead, and whose said foundation has a 65% rating on charitynavigator.org, has money to get a murderer out of jail, but not feed the hungry or house the poor, you know, like Jesus wanted him to do? Okay then...
Justice prevails
Ew
Bet he skips out
1st degree
In other news my pillow stop selling. Then the next week magaoloians buy them all. It's going to be chick fil a all over again. 😂
Good for him, kid's a hero.
Thank God he took out the pedos. Kyle is a hero
This kid is gonna have a great time in prison
Kyle Rittenhouse posts bail with stimulus money.....lol
Awwww, look at the Republican's white supremacists' lil hero....FIRST DEGREE HOMICIDE WTF?? And you HELP him??
They just need to job these charges. He was being chased down and attacked by multiple people with weapons and yes his life was in danger. The fact this is even being contested is illogical!
Jacob Blake riots you mean?
Are they bragging?
I hope they throw the book at this kid
It is not the job of a 17 year old to cross state lines acquire a powerful weapon and act like a soldier or a cop, that is no defense. The street protest was not there for him to take control of, he murdered people for his own 'glorification', and the blood thirsty right wingers cheer him on.
a hero and patriot
He's Innocent.  Glad he's free.
My Pillow guy posts a $2 million bail for a murderer. Dolly Parton donated $1 million dollars to the Moderna covid vaccine research fund. Just shows you what the priorities are for the far right.
Good for him, it's simple dont riot, dont loot, and dont antagonize anyone willing to defend themselves, go ahead call me racist now
President BIDEN is on his way folks...Fat Donnie lickers can still have Fat Donnie in their lives...My Pillow has a Fat Donnie edition...plenty of holes in them to rub one out in.
Wow this is awesome!
Good for him !!!! He should have never been arrested in the first place . Way to go Kenosha kid!!! We are behind you 100%
What magnanimity, well done Mr. Lindell. #freekyle
Questions to Americans: would he still be alive had he been an African American boy?
Kid shouldn't have there. Protesters shouldn't have been there (there was a curfew in effect). Both were violating law. In the end the kid was clearly not the aggressor as there is a ton of video of him running away. Weapon was only turned on people when he had no where else to go. He's not going to to be found guilty.
People voted for Trump why not let this f****** killer out with the help of trump and his followers you know they say America is the greatest country in the world and it is great but it also is f***** up
Kyle Rittenhouse is a patriot and a hero. All charges should be dropped and his property returned to him cleaned and oiled.
Kyle did nothing wrong.
It was clearly self defense. Anyone who thinks otherwise is so biased it has closed their minds.
I liked Mike & Ricky already.  Now I like them even more.  This was a clear cut case of self defense.
Welcome home buddy!
i love my pillow even more now, pillows rescued a kid just trying to defend himself. america oh land o' the free
A killer in the making and the cops are applauding him?????? Is this the Trump America that is supposed to be great again. America has always been great and we will make mistakes and we will clean up our mistakes but America has never been NOT great. Trump has a low opinion of America and the base that he supports is what he thinks America is and nothing more, the only way America can be greater at this time is to get rid of anyone in America who thinks America is a place where you can do what you want and get away with it. Like Trump says he can shoot someone on fifth ave and get away with it, are we going to let him get away with it.
The kid shot those goons in self-defense. They ran up on him and tried to attack him - one guy even tried beating on Kyle with his skateboard while Kyle was on the ground. Kyle defended himself - then turned himself in to the Police. Every one of those goons that attacked Kyle had criminal records - they were 'paid muscle', not regular 'Activists'
Rick Schroeder really? ✔️ MAGA  ✔️ Off my list and into the ✔️ 🗑
He was acting in self-defense.  Three shoots three down.
The Federals send a shooting team to murder a suspect that acted in self defense in Portland but the Fascists get this murderer a 1 million dollar bail bond.
he will be a good spokesperson for the prison to order my pillow brand pillows for everyone.
MY mission is to see this punk NEVER gains any employment as long as I live here. DANG...
🤮
Good ! He should have never been arrested !
Lol man this is sad.
This is so disgusting. This kid is a murderer, regardless of politics.
Kyle will be found not guilty. Americans have the right to defend themselves with deadly force against deadly force. Just like Nick Sandman, he will become a rich man.
Good i hope he walks free at trial. it was clear cut self defense...
WOW!!!
Some groups right now looking for him for revenge...just saying 🙂
no more "my pillows" for this lady.... bailing out a killer.... absolutely wrong.... the crowd was trying to sotp him...he had already killed one person.
Yay!!!! So happy to see him out. He was trying to protect the community. He was doing good things ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ Haters just hating As usual 😂 screw the haters
Disgusting... smh
Why would they charge Kyle with a crime. He was a licensed legal carrier of the weapon he used and he was living in the city where the crime was committed. It's not like he was coming from another state carrying a weapon that he didn't own, that would be crazy. Like a vigilante or something. I mean how stupid do you have to be to go somewhere armed and looking for trouble? I wish we had people that worked in a law type protection job that we paid to professionally handle civil unrest?
Me: Avengers is the best crossover!  This:   Me: Never mind
Mmmmm
If he were a person of color who did the exact thing thing he would have been denied bail in the first place. The safest place for him would be in jail because a white “militia” or lynch mob would hunt him down.
Absolutely awesome. 💯
Kyle should have been let out a long time ago
The Clash “I’m so bored of the U.S.A!
That's great. He should have never been jailed in the first place.
If he was a black kid he would be held without bail.  If you do the crime you need to do the time.  Why was he at a protest with a gun? He deserves all the jail time that he will be getting.
You can say Black Lives Matter but not All Lives Matter, you can say white supremacy but not black supremacy. Kyle should have never been arrested.
thank god i haven't bought any of your junk you sell  I'll make a point to my friends never too buy your crap
Typical
Can money buy freedom
This is my pillow, without pillow I am useless, without me pillow is useless
Awesome!  Good for him.  It's a shame to see this brave teenager defend American values while mature adults act like cowards.  Sheriffs need to deputize everyone with a gun and eliminate political radicals of ANY ideology.
Ew. X3.
We'll be sure to drag'em, 17 yo in possession of a firearm illegally transports that firearm across state lines illegally to go to a protest in opposition of the reason for the protest with the excuse to uphold law and order with a group of white supremacists while also being in contempt of law and order yeah that makes perfectly good sense 😩
He's a hero. I paid for some of his bail.
let him rot in jail
That stupid smile he has on his face will soon fade as he's sentenced to prison
Welcome home kyle we Americans have your back. Thank you my pillow and all of us who dontated to his attourney fund
Hero
This is Amerikkka. The traitorous GOP destroys democracy in plain sight and you can get away with murder, as long as you're white and fighting for the "right side".
You can say he’s innocent or guilty, I’m just glad “peaceful protesters” would not raise a ruckus in the name of the victims cause they’re both white
This is so wrong!
Ricky Schroder?!!I'm starting to think that show was the 1st reality tv ever
Self defense doesn't work when you go looking for trouble and then instigate it by shooting someone first...
Yes we all need to help this young man. He clearly was protecting himself  ( self defense) i have tried to donate for him but only to have money/help given back. Seriously why  are they taking his donation ( go fund me) pages down!!!
he will sue media for millions n deserve every penny
after reading the comments, some of you people need professional help.
VINDICATE KYLE RITTENHOUSE!!!
he's a racist POS that deserves to rot in jail
Well looks like I'm switching to Sealy pillows....
Tha fuq?!
It’s like the world’s shittiest Mad Libs.
Bible said in Last days men will call right things wrong!! And wrong things right !! Yeap were in the final days before the appearance of the Antichrist now!!
he was the ONLY one with a gun. self defense???? from what ????? gtfo with that BS!!
It's about time that an innocent man got bailed out! Self defense is NOT illegal. But, it it does not promote the liberal Communist agenda, it seems to be a crime.
I was just about to buy one of those pillows! Guess I'll buy one of those purple pillow i keep seeing ads about now instead. YOU LOST A VALUABLE CUSTOMER HERE MR. MY PILLOW!!
Im going on a pillow buying spree. Thank you mike for doing for Kyle Rittenhouse what all the celebrities and politicians were doing for the looters rioters arsonist buy bailing him out instead of a paid goon of soro’s bunch of antifa and blm  Bowels Loosely Moving crew. Theyre spreading their s*it all over its about time someone stood up for the good guys. If Kyle had not been armed he would most likely be face a far worse outcome of having his head bashed in by the skate boards antifa uses to attack peaceful protestors with in order to hi jack a peaceful demonstration to cause chaos instead of addressing the issues they say they want to see happen. Jeez its infuriating
He had to say trump supporter smh
Homicide is not a charge...its a term. Murder and manslaughter are the charges the involve homicide. At least use correct terminology
Today’s a good day
Much respect to both of these gentlemen for stepping up. I will surely consider buying at least 1 My Pillow for Christmas. Also, I don’t normally associate actors with this type of upstanding behavior, so much respect to you Mr. Schroeder, I hope to see you in a movie soon, instead of the pebble(Rock).
Not all heroes wear capes! He had to defend himself and he did!
The RIGHT is itching to keep schools open...so they can display their 2nd amendment abilities.
threw away my pillow from the My Pillow people
Im going to have to get a couple of those pillows. Support American business I say.
Go buy a pillow!
Finally some positive news for a change. Kyle is a true hero of the American people.
A brainwashed bootlicker kid that murdered people invoking their 1st Amendment Rights gets bailed out?   This country been screwed.
Well that goes me buying his pillow
This is why I'm starting to hate these people so much. This is why hate you people so much. This breeds a bitter seed of hatred within me and others, and it's warranted. It is so warranted. I hope they suffer immensely. I hope they go through immeasurable pain and suffering.
God works in mysterious ways.
How do you shoot someone in the back and claim self defense?
This guy is a free man and should not be charged with anything. In my eyes he protected himself from violent activist and bullcrap blm people. He is a hero.
Good, it’s called self defense.
It ought to get a medal!
This is the justice system
Good!!!!
The 3 families have already filed in civil court. Kyle will not get out of paying some sort of restitution for for pain, suffering,  medical bills - etc. - Especially for the medic Gaige Grosskreutz that he shot in the arm.  It will probably be settled out of court.  It will be a lost cause because Kyle will claim he has no money.  This is because the people/organizations that using Kyle as a cash cow will no longer be around to help. They take the financial profit that they made off of Kyle and run.
Special Ed attracts other "special eds".
huh not a bad kid
What happened to the felon that was armed that Kyle promptly "disarmed"... If ya catch my drift?      He shot his bicep off 🤣 no more curls for you, sir. But seriously, is he in jail? 🤔
So now hopefully everyone boycotts mypillow and anything that actor is in or has anything to do 🙏🏽
Well someone looks excited to go back to school and practice self defense again
You guys know Kyle is in serious trouble. There's no such thing as walking away from this situation. We know what the defense is going to contend, we know the prosecutors will seek. Kyle will, for his part, will fall somewhere in the middle of what most people believe sentencing should be.
They wouldn’t have had to raise his bail money if social media sites allowed fundraiser links for Kyle.
I am going to finally buy me a my pillow
Where is Dexter when you need him?
Interesting they seemed to include he was Trump supporter. It's like they label people to create some sort of division.
but if a black dude does something like that, would be executed on sight.... so much hypocrisy on the USA
God bless Kyle.
Hopefully someone takes retribution upon him
I guess they figure it wasn't a school, mall, or church so...
#FreeKyleRittenhouse  God bless you Kyle you are a patriot!
CAME HOME ONLY TO FIND OUT TRUMP LOSS HAHHAA #BIDEN2020 #BLM
He and his family needs some street justice immediately
I'm glad this young patriot is out and hopefully is found not guilty for murder and guilty of self defense from thugs.
He never should have been arrested!  It's crystal clear he was acting in self defense!
Well time to throw away all my bed stuff and make an order with mypillow
Look at the videos, people!  He was trying to get away from the attackers and they started to pummel him.  If he hadn't shot them, he might be dead now! The media has misrepresented this situation .
Disgusting. I h8 every, single Trumper.
Stupid kid should have never been there
Ok, so, a presidential candidate gets Russian money.  His son gets a job in China that he’s not qualified for, with compensation that is much more than he deserves and there is proof to boot and nothing happens...... but our president gets impeached for accusations of the very thing that so called presidential candidate is on video bragging about and nothing happens........ what’s wrong with that picture?
Right wingers and their hatred of 'Law and order' hatred of Democracy and love of murder. The same folks who stand For this murderer stan for George Zimmerman, Dylan Roof, Micheal Dunn, George Rockwell. They prove their hatred of American people and a love of murder while waiving a 'blue lives matter' flags. Killer Clowns...the lot...he'll enjoy prison...I'm sure of it.
2 millions bail for this kid. i could use this kid money to feed homeless hungry people and open jobs for americans.
A true American hero
MY KLAN PILLOW AND klub MEMBER WANT-A-BEE
Why stop with a. 2 time killers let's bail them all out.....shm
So happy for him! Freedom to this kid! Fr
An American hero
I stopped using and supporting My Pillow- that company need to be bycotted!!!
Little D Bag. 🤦 my pillow guy just wasted 2 million.
Kyle is a stone cold, corn fed, commie killing machine! National hero.
Don't be too mad at the "My Pillow Guy", he was just being a benevolent friend to Kyle, since his backside has been hammered 🔨 so many times while locked up, I'm sure it's SORE and a pillow to sit on will help in the healing 🛏🤣🤣🤣
It was self defense
he was. and thank you guys for getting him out.
The Supreme law of the land.  The right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.  There is no age limit on the second amendment.  The supremacy clause.
He's unemployed...a loser. Military? No. College? Nope. Walmart? Nope. So what can he do to survive? Food bank? Goodwill? Sounds good. He made a bad choice...so eh...
Glad he got out...poor fellow. I cant wait until his charges are dropped.
What a happy looking murder suspect... such a heroic racist young gang (not militia) member
SO WHAT? HE DID ACT IN SELF DEFENSE! THIS BOY SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE FIRST PLACE! #AMERICANPATRIOTSRISING
Fool, it’s GUN! The big GUN !  Who said everyone could get a big huge Gun?
Courts have already ruled that you do not have the right to "defend" businesses or property that you do not own. That is the duty of law enforcement. Deputization exists for a reason.   I never thought this Nation would be so soiled with so many moronic nationalist warmongers. Then again, you can't show a female areola on TV, but you can show someone's brains get beaten.   Remember, America is A NATION BUILT UPON THE FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE PROTEST GOVERNMENT. To defend that Government would be the function of a Tory, a Loyalist.   This Nation was formed in the aftermath of  a violent protest. (Then came genocide, mass murder of the indigenous and human slavery.)   We can only account for the NOW, and how we build the future. Like affording everyone basic human dignity, healthcare, shelter and food. Meanwhile, we are on the path to seeing the first trillionaire while his workers file for WIC, Medicare, and food stamps.
We support you kyle
Kyle ftw
American Hero!
Clearly self defense, he should never have been charged with a crime.
Think about this ,,,,,you have to be Crazy or on DRUGS to run towards a person holding a weapon to defend himself.This young man was running away from a mob not to have to fire on his attackers. And the Mob continued to assault him after he was knocked down from a blow to his head.He would have been killed if not for the action of self-defense. ☆
America. Where you can buy everything with money. - Good job ! >_>
What a patriotic move. I'm buying more pillows to show support!!
The teen who shot in self defense
"And trump supporter" - yep. Not creating division in the country. This network should be tried for hate crimes.
Happy hes out!
Judge bound to go light, first homicide, and all
Omfg wtf is 2020 LMAO
Murderer
Inventor of the Kenosha Hat trick. He bagged a child molester, a wife beater and a burglar in one night.
what school shooters do when school is closed.
The US Supreme Court "The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute,though having the form and name of law is in reality no law,but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since its unconstitutionality dates from the time of it's enactment... In legal contemplation it is as inoperative as if it had never been passed... Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general principles follow that it imposes no duties, confers no right, creates no Office, bestows no power or Authority on anyone, affords no protection and justifies no acts performed under it. A void act cannot be legally consistent with a valid one. An unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede any existing law. Indeed insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land (the constitution) it is superseded thereby. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it." Bonett V. Vallier,16 NW. 885,136 Wis. 193(1908);Norton V. Shelby county,118 US 425(1886).
It's all fun and games until you realise this is not an onion news video.
Dat pay-to-win doe.
I know Black Riffle Coffee has nothing to do with this but This is bad publicIty for them
This disgusting.
Did WI a service.
He didn't do nothing wrong! Free my boi
They let a a killer out of jail wtf
Well that was totally expected. All that's left now is a Trump pardon so he doesn't have to stand trial. The USA is a failed state.
You only pay 10% of the bond to get bailed out
Umm...good?  Maybe rioters shouldn't be chasing people through the streets shooting guns at them, then they wouldn't get bodied by teenagers.
Awesome 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👏👏👏👏
Let's go baby! A man being attacked killed the attacker. Self defense end of story!
Mr. Pillow sheets over head guy. Well that confirms this young man is as racist as it comes. Oh kkk new guard sure seems to full people into think they don't exist.
Enjoy your freedom kid. You will be picking up soap in the prison shower soon.
If you made a movie like this nobody would believe it was possible to happen.
Lol y'all just giving the corrupt system y'all money for this moron?
BAIL and JAIL...they rhyme and Kylie is headed toward JAIL. He can't get a passport...or a job...
A HUGE MISTAKE !!
While Kyle NEVER should have been at that riot in the first place, he acted in self-defense when he was chased and attacked by multiple people. #RunUpGetDoneUp
So wholesome little family values child tv star is a white supremacy advocate...hmm...that’s good to know. Not shocking really though from a baby faced tow headed white boy.
They help their own. Wake up
So happy to hear that he was bailed out! Kyle has a lot of people praying for him!!!!
based.
this doesn't surprise me
If you guys think this guy should go to jail I recommend watching the video made by colion noir. Play stupid games win stupid prizes, he had every right to shoot those bafoons under current law.
Kyle Rittenhouse, putting people to sleep. Brought you by, My Pillow.
He’s out for now, but he still has to go back and stand trial on his court date! It ain’t over yet!
Anyone who shoots a child molester is a hero in my book
It's all good😁
Im buying a “my pillow” right now.
Who buys my pillow anyways?🤔
Mad dog Killers all of them.
Good, give the murderer a taste of freedom.  It will make the justice that much sweeter.
Kyle Rittenhouuse is a hero of self defense and i'm glad they are dead.
Nice to see some Americans step up and help this kid who is getting shafted by the press and political hacks in the DA’s office.
AWESOME!!
That kid is not going to walk away Scott free.
Kyle gave that dude plenty warning before he put him down the second guy got off with a limb wound consider that lucky in his part.
Like all citizens, he is entitled to a fair trial with a jury weighing the facts.  That said, he should not have been in the situation that he was.   His mother holds a lot of responsibility for putting a juvenile on the streets.
Fat Donnie calls military people LOSERS...and Fat Donnie losers call Kyle a hero. It's only YouTube though...they don't dare come out in public...
kyle was 17 years old. kyle was illegally carrying a weapon. kyle illegally carried that weapon across state lines in hopes of shooting protestors. kyle chased down his first victim and killed him because "kyle felt threated". a responsible gun owner tried to stop an active shooter situation and pursued kyle. kyle tried to flee the scene. kyle then opened fire on those trying to apprehend him, killing one, wounding another. prove me wrong.   edit: there is no clear video of the first shooting. the clearest video shows kyle run to the car dealership parking lot, someone throws a plastic bag, kyle runs between cars, kyle shoots a man and is seen walking back to the body. he makes a phone call and runs. people help the victim, then chase the shooter.
He shouldn’t have been there illegally carrying a firearm to begin with. Hope he’s jailed
Wow he’s a murderer though
Its called  Self defense watch the videos
█021🚷  Quite disturbing culture to use the word racist very loosely as a defense mechanism to some, just because you hate/disagree w/ some1.  This just minimizes seriousness of the real issue of racism w/c no one denies.  How do we even decide whose racist & we are not?🤿 021█
Great, he shouldn't be locked up for defending himself.
Oh let the salty tears flooooow!
Grab your guns and run to find this guy, and then just stand nearby, and if he makes any sudden movements, protect your own life, that's all i'm saying. Buy weapons, travel distances, shoot people, defend your actions as heroic.  Does this make sense to anyone? Not to me. Oh wait, you can't figure out how to use a mask or wash your own hands after using the bathroom? A bunch of sht sandwich eating meathead murderers. Tragic.
WTF. If this boy gets off.  Something is really wrong.  I boycott my pillow.
Just because you are out on bail doesn’t mean you won’t get convicted and go to prison.
Good luck proving self defense in court. You’re guilty. How can you feel good about killing 2 innocent people?? Yes things got rowdy, but killing someone is not the answer. It’s crossing the line into what we call murder.  Shouldn’t be out on bail but whatever...  Now we know who got you out, so we won’t be supporting them either.  Very disappointed to hear the news. 👎
WOW.  Devils supporting each other 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeah if that was a person with color he would still be in there with no bound America time too rise up
I Will never buy a pillow from this guy.  He is a part of the problem....SAD !!
🖕🏾🐽
These people make me sick. He was not acting in self defense and I hope this kid gets life without parole.
This is awesome NEWS!!!
Enjoy your freedom while you can.
Rittenhouse acted in self defense watch the 17 minutes of full video coverage it’s cut and clear. Plus 2 of the guys were sexual predators and domestic abusers even one had a gun. So pretty cut and dry case. Sad Media won’t show you the entire videos because this is really a non issue.
Conclusion: All trump supporters are evil.
How did he get bail for Murder
Great news he should have never been arrested to begin with hope he retrieves millions of dollars for defamation
Juvenile Unlawful Carry: The Kenosha Public defends itself against an imminent lethal threat, and chases a vigilante armed child. Protesters report armed child vigilante just shot someone. Protesters then give chase to protect Public from Unlawful Carry Rifle Wielding child. Rittenhouse was a criminal the very instant he illegally slung that AR-15 in Kenosha WI. Does the Public have the right to defend itself against an armed criminal? ..not a prosecutor...just sayin'.
Glad Kyle is out on bail.   Kyle, you’re a true American Patriot brother. We got your back.
The kid knew how to use a gun. We need more kids like this.
My pillow is a crazy people
This is how they subvert look at the phrasing, my pillow founder and Trump supporter. It wasn't relevant to the story at all but you do you
yall simping over a fat incel dork
Hero
Rittenhouse was a lifeguard and trained EMT. He was out there helping injured people he even offered help to the terrorist that attacked him. BLM and ANTIFA attacked him first,Rittenhouse retreated multiple times. BLM/ANTIFA stalked Rittenhouse throughout the streets of Kenosha then they shot at him and hit there own commie in the back so Rittenhouse returned fire self defense what the problem he shot a pedo who cares only the news is upset about pedo getting killed. Hispanics for Trump 🇺🇸👏👊👍
Good thing I hate My Pillow!!
Still calling them protestors that’s cute.
What the ...?
How dumb do you have to be see it other than self defense ! ! ! ! !
He was acting in self defense. I'm glad these guy's helped Kyle out and posted bail for him. Keep fighting this Kyle. The truth will come out in court and set you free. Hang in there kid.
That moment when you chase someone who has a rifle and then shoot at him and expect him not to fire back lmao
Yeh cancel that brand wtf
My Pillow guy does not know how to stay in his lane; first  he was advising the president on the pandemic response, now he's funding a terrorist's bail?  Busy boy needs to stick to infomercials.
The wickedness of this world,government and society will not go un punished. The Wrath and Judgement of Abba Father is at hand. Shalom
riKKKy silver hoods
Hells yeah! An AMERICAN HERO!!!!!!!
He killed 2 people. He and his mom who drove him to the murder scene should pay for those 2 lives.
I mean, they both put people to sleep.
I-have-swept'away-your Offences-like-the-morning Mist-
Sad sad
They forgot to mention that 1.2 of the 2 million was crowd funded by small donation.... Even though go fund me cucked out.
I'm buying 20 pillows
Best news I’ve heard all year. We all pray for you , Kyle
Always want a My Pillow but now will never think of enriching a man who bails out murders.
$2 Million just for self defense...
They’re straight up promoting and funding a domestic terrorist. The right hasn’t been hiding it for the past couple of years. It’s really disgusting to see where republicans have taken us.
It was 100% self defense you liars. An angry, violent mob with weapons and guns charging at you all because you extinguished one of the fires set by the mob.
¡¡murdurer!!!
🤦‍♂️ RACIST DEVILS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DESTROYING THE US.
WTF
What I like to see 😎
Time to buy more MyPillow products for CHRISTmas presents.
Great news.
Look, its evidence of the major trump victory, 3:1 ratio in likes to dislikes
Can we please just fix the world l Already your taking pictures smiling after you killed someone
More people should be like Kyle. Bet the rioters will stop destroying cities real quick
He should have stayed in jail.  Silly little man
He is not guilty - dems want there pound of flesh
Top ten anime crossovers
Kyle is an American HERO🇺🇸♥️🙌🏻🎼🎁
also dojnt forget to mention what they were doing to get shot, you one side story telling schmucks
When a person,being without fault,is in a place where he has a right to be, is violently assaulted, he may without retreating, repel by force and if in the reasonable exercise of his right of self defense, his assailant is killed, he is justified.

Crackhead Pillow Bonds. America has become a joke.
He was attacked first. Nothing was done when they killed the retired policeman. Nothing was done  to them burning down businesses and looting and killing. So get over it. He should be free like the others. 😎

AMERICAN HERO
I wonder if the faces of the people he killed haunt him as he tries to sleep at night
This comment section does not disappoint
Clear self defense case. Should never have even had to post bail. Hope he is freed.
As he happily wears his “black rifle” shirt after murdering someone with a black rifle. Wow.
I’m black & proud! 💪🏾 BUT, after digging deeper, this kid is INNOCENT!!! https://youtu.be/NSU9ZvnudFE
If you can tell me the correct answer to why the DA is going after the kid and the Judge gave such a high bail, you get a 🍪
Those people (pillow guy and Schroeder) obviously didn’t see the video where a person came on the lot to throw a rock into a car window in said lot and this kid said don’t throw that rock and the person didn’t and this kid shot him anyways. Then word of mouth spread that he shot that guy in the lot and to the people trying to apprehend him were doing so because they thought he was running from the scene of his crime! That kid did murder someone and that person wasn’t threatening his life so that’s murder!!
Gd job conservative White America showing us your hypocrisy once more. Bailing out murderers; it's what Jesus would do I'm sure.
Good.
But tDump has SIGNED  Orders to Execute 8 People with 1 Executed last week and 2 whom have NOT been found Guilty of Charges All To Gratify Himself before he leaves office. None of which is HIS BUSINESS. You may do Evil Against Innocent People BUT ONE DAYYY..He may walk But All involved including him will Answer to Karma
Kyle Rittenhouse is a murderer, plain and simple
This is stupid
Let me guess? They support Trump too. ✌
Kid is wearing a Black Rifle Coffee shirt. What a douchbag
Kyle never should have been charged bc it was self defense and anyone who watches the video footage can easily see that is what happened. As usual, the media is lying about him (like Nick Sandmann, who won 275 million from cnn) being a white supremacist and the biden campaign is also being sued for claiming such nonsense on their propaganda commercial. We the People know the truth! 🇺🇸
He crossed state lines heavily armed to murder two people, he's going away for a long time.
Trump supporters is not above the law
put him back to jail
Lindell is TARGET!
Good he should be out of jail and charged for murder should be dropped. The shooting was clearly in self defense the raw uncut footage from that night paints a clearly different story than the one the media is trying to portray
Killed people
They making an actual terrorist their hero. Strange people
Clearly it was self defense have you seen the footage !?
Self defense is clear in his case and im happy for him to be home with his family for the holidays💕🇺🇸✌
Crazy how, in the freest country on the planet, you can face charges of murder for defending yourself against a mob of lunatics.
His time will come......
Dead man walking- hope its televised when he gets it!
Top ten villain- team ups.
This kid is super young but obviously should not have gone to that place with a gun because that’s vigilanteeism it’s illegal. Obviously people shouldn’t approach somebody with a weapon and try to take it from him because yeah they’re going to shoot you.
❤❤❤kyle
Disgusting ❗🤬
People over the age of 70 shouldn’t be able to vote no more. Just get out the way you got a decade max before you croak. 😂
He shouldn’t be out on bail. People like him are the reason prisons need to exist. He is a danger to society.
Good job mike,... and rick, watched you every day growing up brother...glad to see you are a good man standing up for what is right...
Wtf.....🖕🖕🖕🖕
God Bless Kyle Rittenhouse and other good Samaritans like him!
Oh my god. I dont even understand how he is a cause celebre for the right.  I guess they presume the people he killed were democratic voters, but pretty weak. And am I the only one having homicidal fantasies about a pillow shaped guy with more money than sense or basic human decency?
don't forget that one of the victims was a pedo. who knew you could shoot into a barrel of aquatic animals and hit a fish
Anyone know if he went to the mall yesterday?
Nothing surprises me anymore since Dump Truck was elected.  Nothing to see here folks.
vigilante point-blank period
At least it is only bail, he will probably have to spend a serious amount of time in prison, and they are going to love him in there!
People who have a problem with Kyle are people who side with villains. The left loves evil people and hates the good guys. That is because the left is evil.
hes going to jail
If it was one of their militants, they would say it was self defense. Not he claims it was self defense.
He should Have never been arrested to Begin with.
Yall praise a highschool dropout, snitch cause you hate that blaa as ck folks are tired of being profiled a a nd murdered by authority system.    Yall are a bunch of sickos. Do america a favor. Go stand in a big mexican standoff circle and blow each others brains out.
Just bought some great supplies from My Pillow!
Best collab of 2020
If BLM comes back to my community I want this kid protecting my streets!!!  #gotthejobdone
Kyle is a hero!
Claims was self defense.  Wow. Did you watch the tape of him defending himself I know i did.
Cops know what that means. Cops know self defense; officer safety. The whole police force probably agrees with protecting the community. But cops don't have opinions. Keep it 💯 this guy was bailed out compared to a lot of other arrest cases. Some kind of special.
Wtf is wrong with our world. My god
Everyone has the right to bail...but for Kyle...JAIL is real. And you know what happens to PUNKS in jail...
Ulysses I threw a Molotov cocktail at the guy they shot at the guy and he can't defend himself too bad he didn't have a butt on the end of his gun you could have took more of them out
He will get what's coming to him. Just a little break cause he's white and a  t rump voter
Murderer.
He WAS acting in self defense
Good for these patriots
Unbelievable...well, believable but still wildly unacceptable. This kid should see bars and guards until he's into his thirties at least!
Silver 🥄 indeed...
yo dude killed two people
sick people in comments do the patriotic thing and get professional help
@blackriflecoffeecompany you guys really support this dude? man I liked you guys..
Enjoy prison u punk
Where are all the stories about the massive voter fraud??
No more trump pillow [My Pillow].
This is some of the best news! Kyle youre a hero🎉👏👍
The videos shows he was acting in self defense
GOD BLESS THIS VERY YOUNG PATRIOT. LET'S ALL 🙏 PRAY TO KEEP HIM OUT OF JAIL.
here we go
"He claims he was acting in self defense". Well thats because ... he was.
Cool. Now free James Fields
Et tu, Ricky Schroeder?
you have to one stupid F**K to think he wasn't acting in self defense
Good for him. Innocent until proven guilty right?
MyPillow sales are about to boom this holiday season. Good timing? Or just a coincidence 😏
KYLE is a true Patriot We need more people like him that are willing to sacrifice themselves to protect others and there property
WTF!!!! Now it is cool to bail murders out of jail!!!
That kid is a hero and a PATRIOT!!!!!!!! and,will always be remembered as so. And to the left. Epoch Times and Trump team has released the Election server seized by our military in Frankfurt Germany was downloaded and analysed. Trump won by over 400 electorial votes as fact. The fraud was in detail and found. Trumo won....Intel community will be coming forward in in days to come. This is no joke. Fact check it
He shouldn't have been there in the first place! Idiots with guns.
Murderer.
My boi is free!
Good reason NOT to buy one of his skanky pillows
The world is just absolutely out of its mind right now ...
Awesome good for him.  Finally good news
In most states Bail is 10% of what is stated, so in this case would of been 200,000 not 2 Mil. Strongly feel Mike made a safe bet.🇺🇸
If I see Kyle in a crosswalk...oh wait...I didn't see him!
At least Rush Limbaugh's lung cancer is getting worse. " Talent on loan from God"  is coming due.
This country is just plain racist and stupid...
Kyle, is the kid who should have been beaten in high school, but never was.
KING KYLE
People is gonna take care him.. don't worry
Good for him after this is left behind he well have a beautiful and bright future
They are about to screw that boy.
His aim was true. 🇺🇸👍🏾
Kyle is a 17 year old with an illegally possessed rifle who chose to go out and instigate himself into a situation he wasn't needed in. He had a $12 fishing bag on his hips filled with bandaids and was screaming "I am an EMT' which he isn't. He shot someone and then fled the scene. What a great medical technician, him and Derek Chauvin deserve a buddy cop TV show. He got attacked AFTER he shot someone. No less righteous than this guy thinking he can shoot someone for destruction of property that wasn't even his and claimed himself didn't even really know the owners. (But shouted about how he works at the car dealership when asked why he was out there) which is a lie. He wanted to feel like a hero. He was a vigilante. He shot 3 people with an illegal rifle. He belongs in jail.
Good, he’s an innocent kid
Self defense ,skyscreamers. Deal with it.
Good kid.... Keep stacking up that trash
The kid is innocent. He went there to protect businesses from criminals trying to destroy them, that's why he brought a rifle. There is a video of him giving out water to protesters and standing with medical kit to help the injured. Whats so confusing? Y'all americans should take an example from him. He's only 17 and was there to protect fellow American livelihood. I salute this Kid, and this comes from immigrant that loves America and it's constitution.
Disgusting and disgraceful.  He went with the intent who's kidding who? No 17 year old gets driven by his mother with a AR. Get real. Kid took a life ...period
If he was black, brown, red, yellow or white... doesn’t matter; ANYONE who was in his position would be seen as defending himself/herself after reviewing all the video footage.  Clearly he was trying to run away from a mob who was trying to do him harm. He followed the law and after he was no longer able to run away to safety his only option was self defense. Someone pointed a handgun at him and he acted in self defense against that person.  Kyle is innocent of any charges and once the evidence is collected and reviewed the judge and or jury will see this, despite everyone’s opinions on the matter.
The right's favorite murderer.
Good. He should not have been in jail in the first place. Put the blm Antifa democrat ran mob behind bars.
This boy was sent to jail because rrw media told him it's okay to take people's lives if you disagree with them. So jail is better than college pursuing his endeavors. What planet do these people live on?
So now Trump supporters are bailing murderers out of jail. Well isn't this just great. I'm bracing for martial law at this point.
Those who watched the video : Kyle is defending himself, those who didn't watch the video : He's a murderer WAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAAAA.
Looks like he is hero to protect the normal citizens.
He did nothing wrong
He should not even be in jail. The video showed self defense
Crazy helps crazy
It all started when Obama got elected.
If the government refuses to do their job and let's chaos happen in the street, I don't think he should be liable. It was during a period where the governor and mayor decided to abandon their duty to protect citizens, and citizen took it upon themselves. Beyond that, the act of the shooting itself was clearly self defense.
Don’t you love how this network constantly leaves out important facts, they tell you a story, so you feel a certain way, your hooked on their manipulation
Look up pictures of him down on the ground being attacked. Of course lame stream media doesn’t show the whole story.
It's unreal and terrifying that people can even debate self-defense when everything is on video, clear as day. It's literally like denying the sky is blue. Is this some type of normalized mental illness by the left? Utter insanity, this kid did nothing wrong and everything right.
Get your bicep shredded in one night using this one weird trick!
Good shouldn’t have been in jail anyways
Good
I’m going to buy a My Pillow now
Good! If someone is pointing a pistol at you, trying to kick you in the head while your on the ground, then I call that self defense.
Kyle needs to counter charge the judges and DAs under title18 USC sections 241and 242,and bring charges in violation of title 5 USC sections 3331,3333,7311 perjury in violation of oath of Office, perjury is treason and a felony under state and federal law.
Good. Americans stand up when people try to burn their cities.
Will mr. pillow pay all the legal fees, and will kyle rittenhouse be the new pillow sales guy on the tv commercial ,will mr pillow supply pillows to the prison where kyle serves his  sentence .
That kid is innocent tho. And YouTube literally took the full proof video off. If you were in his shoes you would've done the same thing. He was being attacked. But I also do not agree of him being in that neighborhood that wasn't even his.
America, you have done slipped the rail this time.
Hero, patriot, UNEMPLOYED. That's Kyle in a nutshell.
Kyle Rittenhouse deserves to walk free. Video evidence proves it was self defense.
I wish it was like back in the day. First to draw wins.......
Kyle is innocent and was self-defense!
Charging this kid is a massive injustice.
Kyle Rittenhouse Bell was set for two million dollars the cop killer cop killer in Houston's has a  lower Bond that should say something  about the politics involved
Yissssssirrski
Unbelievable
Why? What part do they really play in this? Was the kid paid or supported by some deviant group? He killed for heavens sake! Since when is that perfectly alright? What year is this?
He claims. GTFO of here with that under-handed comment. This is my pillow for 2020.
Utterly disgusting 🤮  Here’s a bit of truth that needs to be understood: if you have a gun in your hands and someone without a gun is threatening you, then you f*cking are not the one who’s life is in danger. Open carry is an idiotic law that doesn’t recognize that having a gun out in a public event is obviously intended as intimidation and an overt threat to do grievous bodily harm. This piece of crap should be convicted of first degree murder and spend the rest of his life in prison (or worse). Open carry laws be damned, in this era of random mass shootings anyone who carries a gun in public should be assumed to be a potential killer. And anyone who takes a gun to a protest should not be considered to be peacefully protesting (or counter protesting).
The pillow guy is the same person who had a new covid therapeutic he was selling until he crashed and burned during his snake oil sale.
Oh wow am 100 pillow's now
Should have never seen the booking process of jail to start with!!! It's not illegal to defend one's self!!!
Failed Creepy Doofbag Biden underperformed detested Hilary in nearly ALL COUNTIES.....LOL....yet, he “won” the election....RRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT............FAILED PROP GOOF JOE BIDEN WON NOTHING. WILL WIN NOTHING. AND NEEDS TO CONCEDE. HE IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE.
Thank God. Praise the LORD
It will be quite the reckoning when he goes back to the courtroom under oath. Two counts of homicide and one count of assault with a rifle he illegally had. Right winger Americans proving they're hippocrates who think killing unarmed citizens is okay.
Boycott MyPillow!
Have yet to see any of these posts show all the footage, it was 100% self defense
Wow
TDS did this !
Never really cared for my pillow guy but I'm definitely buying a couple of his pillows now 😁
Were all infinite beings having a physical experience
Finally some good news!
Oh wow! That’s amazing news! Good for him! God Bless him and his family!
If the democrats can bail out rioters, looters, Antifa, and BLM that destroy businesses,  I see  no problem with bailing out an innocent kid that should have never went to jail !  Why don't the news ever show how he had a gun pointed at him and he was defending himself ?  And that HE DID NOT shoot someone at the other scene he left from ?
but why
he did act in self defense
The only good commie, is... well, you know the rest.  Kyle is a good boy, he was just making good communists.  Kyle did nothing wrong!😎🇺🇸
america are you okay
The one on the street was definitely self dense. If he did not have a gun, he would die. Rosenbaum attacked him, but not sure if shot him back was justified. Rosenbaum was throwing something to him. But again, we did not know what Rosenbaum was up to.
Go My Pillow guy!!!   Off to buy one right now.
About time🤴🏻
Lol he claims? Did nobody watch the videos? Clear sd
Awesome. Never should have been in jail.
Good news. Thanks.
Welp so happy I never gave into the pillow infomercials....
The free stuff and socialism that Kyle is receiving. Hmmmmmmmmmm I wonder what side of the politial spectrum he is on   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I mean let's be real, murder should be no bail. They extradited and then allowed bail? Seems odd.
Thank God. Poor Kyle ! Anyone with a brain knows it was self defense. It’s plain as day on the video!
That ceo just screwed his company
He was also on video beating up on a girl in a parking lot that same week, hes sick and should be locked up
My pillow
Self-defense isn't murder.
This kid should have never been locked up in the first place.
i dont understand how anyone can watch all the videos from that night and come to any conclusion other than self defense he was literally RUNNUNG AWAY and being chased into a corner "oh he drove across state lines" he lived 20 minutes away and worked as a life guard in that town. "oh but he wasn't old enough to own that gun" ok well that's a different charge that has nothing to do with the fact that he was being attacked. not to mention one of the people he shot was a convicted felon in with a hand gun and he is still walking free despite posting on Facebook afterward that he intended to and wishes he had killed kyle. this is clearly a politicly motivated stunt to discourage people from defending them selves from the angry mobs taking over out cities
Great ! Time to buy a pillow ! Videos show he acted in self defense but don't expect MSM to tell you that !
Maybe he can find some Black people to shoot now that he is out.  Bless his little vigilante  heart.
Both guys have gone viral for putting multiple people to sleep, great crossover.
Future earnings for Kyle boy...$0.00. I wouldn't hire him to count my TP tickets.
They better leave that boy alone! It was self-defense! They better leave him alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!
His story sounds as ridiculous as a Black guy from Chicago showing up in Mississippi to help "protect (Black-owned) businesses" from them entitled folks. Oh it was just self defense though... and the Black guy definitely wouldn't be labeled as a hero
He is a murderer and needs to be in prison for many years.
He purchased this gun with his stimulus check!!!  https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kyle-rittenhouse-says-he-used-coronavirus-stimulus-check-buy-ar-n1248290
Pathetic
Why was he in jail and felon with gun was not?
Why can’t the news talk about him being hit in the head with a skate board, kicked in the ground and shot at after a man screams in his face to shoot him continuously, or how he gave first aid on the night in question to others pre shooting and that him putting out a fire at a gas station started the whole violence...   And can we not add those shot to the Darwin awards list for most stupid ways to die? As in being in a mob and attacking a young man with a rifle.   I would never attack a armed person unless I was being held up and feared for my life... but to go out of your way to attack a armed person?   That’s suicide and cops deal with that when they retreat backwards and a dude with a knife goes for they saying shoot me...   Suicidal intentions for sure-
Killing/murdering 2 people on video no less.......and they let him out on bail???????
Thats Great news!!!!!!! It's about time he should have never been in there in the first place.
Is there any video of the incident?
Good.
Look at all the butthurt in here...defending a dead pedophile and dead woman-beater.  That's why antifa/blm supporters are eternal losers mentally paralyzed with jealousy and stupidity.  All the media support and democrat leadership won't change them from being loads-that-should've-been-swallowed.
LOVE THIS!
Kyle's a national treasure!
It’s funny how they never talk about high profile looters and murders getting released during the peaceful protests or the movie celebrities who bailed them out. That should tell you something about the media.
Lets make sure he gets his illegal gun back too. There's more protest going on and since he's free for now why not?
Not found guilty yet but according to facebook he is worse than hitler
The Wisconsin government appreciates your $2 million dollar donation, but you'll still be going to prison for 40 years Kyle. You committed blatant murder. You have no defense. The people you shot weren't even armed. They didn't start attacking you until you started shooting people. THEY were defending themselves from YOU, Kyle.
The white privilege! At it FINEST.!!  🕊❤🙏
Never thought I would do it, but I just bought 2 pillows and covers for like  81 + shipping...LOL   I think this kid deserves to be out while he is awaiting trial. Everyone will know the truth then. He is not running anywhere.
He should be out! He was attacked!!!!
This piece of garbage deserves to rot behind bars where he belongs.
Boycott his pillows.
Dude looks like a 13 year old
I just love the leftists heads 💥🤯💥🤯💥🤯💥exploding.   So satisfying.  Hating on the pillow guy for god’s sake. 🤦‍♀️
LOVE THIS❗GOOD JOB (stay safe) STAND YOUR GROUND YOUNG MAN  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👀👍 THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE  THAT NIGHT     🖕ANTIFA AND B.L.M. GANGSTER GANGS
He did this country a favor
MyPillow guy is a real one!
he's a patriot and hero.
WTH!!!!! My god people! Wake the F -up!!
But why🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
What's the difference between Kyle Rittenhouse and a paraplegic?.......  Kyles gonna walk
If your getting attacked by a group of dummies by all means pull the trigger...  Self Defense at that point...
Our country need some serious fixing
WHO VOTED FOR KYLE RITTENHOUSE PENCILED HIM IN
If she shoots people again.      I told you so.
Oh this is the kid that shot people that attacked him first ok this is good, good for him.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
My pillow sucks 25 $ I would love to have back
This man exercised his rights under constitutional law. Yes he killed two FELONS that were attacking HIM ONE of which had a FIREARM! You idiots in the MSM and sheep that follow you are running out of time. ACT like AMERICANS NOW. Before you're permanently branded DOMESTIC ENEMIES!!
Great news!! Self defense is not a crime!
When Trump's re-election is over. The Kyle's will be out in force the day. They'll be the ones without masks grinning at the cameras.
This is a case of natural selection. You rush at a man carrying a rifle and not expect to be shot? If he let them get the gun you can bet he would’ve been killed without question.
Heck. I'm an old Woodstock Hippie and peace and love etc. But I would of shot those guys as well if  I was Kyle. Make me a juror and I'd never say guilty.
Finally ,he should have been out alot sooner, but now we just gotta hope judges will do their job an he'll be a free man.
this song says it all   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTf_x_-ipSM
I cannot believe this.
real american hero!
I will now be purchasing my pillow products!
Comrade rittenhouse took queen trump's claim literally she could shoot someone on 5th ave and get away with it,  communist backers for rittenhouse bail want a one party system/ communist so they don't have to pay their fair share in taxes. These clowns are all in along with the federalist society/ communist brethren believe in lack of a decent public education system produces compliant fools like this kid and the militia groups.
American Hero, those BLM thugs had it coming 💪🏼🇺🇸
I doubt a jury will be convinced it was self-defense if Kyle traveled to a far-away place to engage in an area of civil unrest, illegally armed in  public. I mean, I'm pro 2A, but Kyle went out of his way to put himself in a hot situation there, and he's likely to be seen as a vigilante. Because he was a vigilante. He was a 17-year-old kid who went looking for trouble. People should perhaps stop saying "de-fund the police", if what they really mean is "invest more in education and social services", because if we de-fund the police, we're likely to see a lot more stories like Kyle's. De-funding the police would be a huge mistake. Preventing crime would be a great idea.
WTF
This is great news
Seeking out trouble Is not the same thing As acting in self defense It could be argued that it diminishes what someone who went through an ACTUAL SELF DEFENSE incident had to deal with... Also imo The individual who was killed was a mentally unstable man who the hospital clearly should not have released... nothing about any of it is ok / heroic / acceptable and his mother should be in just as much trouble. You do not escort your kid across state lines with a rife to "help stop a bad situation"
So he crossed state lines to go to a protest and without being hurt himself shot and killed people defending himself... Bless this Trump cult logic... Glad I never bought a my pillow they'll not be getting our business.
Three last names that couldn't sound more Nazi-isk.
So glad this young man is out now
I mean it was self defense. But he didn’t need to be there doing that, who is he to be there like that?
go Ricky.....baby
Lols ,,,,, media doing anything to not talk about the Kraken ,, there even talking about this says it all ,,
If I got ATTACKED I won't hesitate to shoot!
America is so backwards
My pillow is about to experience a sales spike.
Put in jail for self defense and a activist judge put an astronomical 2 million dollar bail amount on the kid, Adults with a rap sheet a mile long dont get bail amounts that high.....
I'm on the other side of the world looking at America like wtf
Kyle does not look remorseful in the least. In the photo of him with Ricky he looks like he thinks this is all a game. He looks like he just won an  online first person shooter game. This is a face of someone not connected to the gravity of his situation. He may not go to jail but he sure should never be allowed to have a gun or maybe let out in public.
Someone needs to take care of him since the government clearly didn’t. Who will make the sacrifice?
Wow this is sad. He doesn’t deserve to be out of jail
Good now we know who the real raciest are they been hiding so long now there coming out
W
LETS GO! FREE KYLE!
Oooo weee
Woooow didn’t know Ricky Schroeder still had that much money
Isn’t it illegal for a 17 year old to have a gun in the first place ?Let alone an AR-15 ?
Although Kyle probably shouldn't have been involved, he had a right to defend himself and I'm glad he's been let out. The crossover is *EVEN BETTER*
Kyle did nothing wrong. W have a right to defend ourselves.
I don't understand why he is allowed out on bail. He has proven to be a danger to others. I think his case is tragic.  I don't think he had the mental capability to think things through.  I see the tape and wished the police had intervened.  If was after curfew, he was a minor, and alone with a gun in a volatile situation. I'm not putting the responsibility on the police I just feel there were so many different points where others could have stopped it from happening.  I'm not a big gun fan but after moving to the country I understand it. I just don't know how someone who does not recognize consequences should have guns. I know children that own guns but their competent parents have taught them responsibility and the parents are right with them when the child handles the gun and locks them up safely afterwards. I think the children I know have far more mental maturity, guidance and ability to reason that this young man. The whole situation is tragic. It is our right to own but some people should not have access to guns. But who is going to play King Solomon and make each of the individual decisions?
That's a lot of old ladies' ssi checks go into bailing a murderer out.
The MyPelow guy bailed him out 😂 you can’t write this stuff
American Hero  Watching him lop off that guys hand was like eating warm chicken soup.🤗  He should get a medal 👍
A free Patriot
I hope some good samaritan takes care of this problem. Thank bob for the 2nd amendment.
This is fantastic news.  I think I need to go buy some pillows!
This little murderer won't do so well when in prison Gen pop.
Cool. He made bail. He still has charges tho. He will be back in prison soon. Where he belongs.
This murderer got bail?!?!?!?
Yesss yes yes thank you
All I can say is that My Pillow isn't ever going to be my pillow.
It was premeditated murder as he shot people carrying weapons charging at him while lying on his back after being knocked to the ground taking a skateboard full force to the head twice......
You guys see how Rittenhouse "disarmed' that guy with the pistol?!? EPIC!
Trash fake news
Justified killings in my opinion free my man's
Rittenhouse is not a murderer.
White boy better hire bodyguards. He ain't safe no more
The my pillow founder bails out the kid who killed 2 white people so the kid can do the Same thing again #Facts but hey.. Keep Up The Bad Work😉😉
A reminder how they think
He was fing defending himself, screw you leftist.
This country is trash.
If I had a lot of $ I would have done it too.
I'm praying Kyle is acquitted of all charges.  He was defending himself.  People do not have the right to attack someone for having opposing views.
Glad he's out because he's innocent
Wonderful. Just wonderful.  A couple of celebrities who are championing someone who not only murdered two people, but was illegally carrying a gun.  Pathetic that these kind of people are your heroes. SMDH...
King kyle
Deplorable killer gets bail, killer ,killer,killer
Good. It was self defense.  And BLM IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
Kyle looks over the moon in that thumbnail pic, it's like he doesn't have a shred of guilt
Anyone watching the video could see it was self-defense.  They're just trying to nail him because he's a Trump supporter.
Welcome to the Trump Death Cult.
Didn't you know? Just about all Republicans are murderers and rapists. Some, I assume, are fine people.
this is truly disturbing...but then NAZIs do stick together.
The My Pillow guy is a crack head. Look it up.
A straight up killer supported by the racist far right. This murderer will be judged soon enough
Wrong
Good for him! Glad he is out !
Just watch the video, clear case of self defense, he was trying to get away.
The charges against Rittenhouse are just as fraudulent as the election.
Absolutely disgusting
This is good news! Kyle was acting in self-defense. He was running away from his attackers and took no action until he was physically under threat. He had ever right to defend himself in that situation!
That is fantastic news!!!  AWESOME!!
To anyone that owns a my pillow  or was deciding on purchasing one PLEASE SEND IT BACK, especially if you disagree with this man's views on morals & life
👏👏👏
Not all heroes wear capes!!!
God bless Kyle Ritenhouse! God bless Mike Lyndell! God bless America! #Trumpwon2020landslide #DTS #NEVERBIDEN #NEVERSOCIALISM  #DOMINIONGATE #ELECTIONGATE2020 #SPYGATE #LAPTOPGATE #DNCCORRUPT
Rittenhouse gone be  hiding until he is court date. Hopefully he’ll be taken care of before.
What protests are you talking about? You mean riots?
All charges need to be dropped!! He was clearly defending himself
Thank God. That was self defense 100%.
Thank God people who have the ability helped this kid.
That's outstanding. Soon he'll be exonerated & free. I hope he joins the armed forces & puts his skills to good use.
And the swamp just keeps getting deeper, polluting everything it touches.
I am so glad he is out but the charges they using against him are BS because they have let ANTIFA and BLM get away with worse crimes against everyone and they don't do crap about that .
All of you can direct your complaints to Rosenbaum's victims.
Free my man he did nothing wrong 👏👏👏
Good. Be out of jail. You know, where you're free to encounter the public & aren't protected by bars or law enforcement....
I haven’t seen people so excited to hang out with a murderer since Martha Stewart did a cooking show with Snoop Dogg
Good!
I hope never to ricky Schroeder in any movie or tv show again. I hope his career is over. Why does some one from another state come over with a gun and say his life was threatened by someone. Really? Say home boy. No one wanted you there or needed you there. I hope you get time in prison it was premeditated.
First 2 guys tried to take his (Kyles) gun- last guy actually pulled out his own pistol(then got his arm shot by Kyle); all this was done while chasing Kyle because Kyle put out a fire 🔥 which is forbidden apparently
was it murder tho????
What a disgrace. That guy needs to be in jail.
thats bs
Only in America
Glad he’s finally home! It’s a shame he had to spend any time in jail,
The second amendment bailed him out. It will see he is free. God bless the Republic
"claims" He was acting himself defense?  What part of the videos did this weak lying journalist not understand?
2020 has been the most broken season of this series for sure...
God bless you little brother stand strong !!! AND STAND BY
Kenosha Kyle did nothing wrong! True American patriot. He is on the right side of history, what about you?
Beautiful. Love this country <3
enjoy your time out, it will not last
So racists helped another racist out makes sense
Presumption of innocence
you don't bring a weapon to a rally unless you plan to use it   real men here backing this kid up like that... oh yeah... real men.... yeah   uh huh....  positive reinforcement for killing another human being  yep realllll meeennnn..... oh yeah    JUST TAKE ME ON A DATE...pfffffhhhhhttttt.....  this is fkg pitiful
I hope Biden supporters don't get angry again😏
Incredible that people donated money to bail out a domestic terrorist. Never thought I’d see the day, but 2020 is full of surprises.
USA is a crap 💩
Never in the history of America has a Black American ever gotten bail for 1st degree murder.   Wtf?  🤬
Self defense ! This murder  drove to another state that was under civil unrest,  with an assault rifle he just purchased, and now he is claiming self defense... Boy,  you went up their to cause more harm and havoc.  Why did you take an assault rifle....to render aid?
I bought everything else Lindell has sold me so I'm buying that he's absolutely right on Rittenhouse being not guilty because it's clear on camera that he was acting in self defense.
That boy needs to be in jail
Disgusting,  I hope both are hit by karma big time
This is what privilege looks like 🙄
i think you mean self defence suspect.
And the vice president elect posted bail for BLM and Antifa Thugs.  This is a kid.
I don’t know what they’re proud of. They’re backing someone that killed someone else to other people. And they are proud?
Kyle, thank you for putting those scum dogs out of their misery.
Good! He shouldn't even be there to begin with.
The my pillow guy (ex crack dealer) and Ricky Schroeder (assaults wife)are canceled!
Very strange combination.
People should stop buying that crap pillows. they are frauds
They should have left him in jail that was the safest place for him
I saw the video.  The kid just did self-defense.  Nobody should attack somebody just because he/she has a weapon.
don't let him rest a single minute without been confronted with his actions
Teen Hero👍🏿🇺🇲 defended himself against two convicted antifa pedos.
It’s ok he got away rite someone died but that doesn’t matter rite nice job you grow up what if that was your brother that was killed that’s what I thought
This whole story is a bald faced lie!
Thank you Mike Lindell and Ricky Schroder. Although this kid shouldn't have been in jail in the first place. He should sue.
Run up on Kyle with a pistol; run away partially disarmed.
17 year old killer is out of jail
So murderer gets out of jail and someone uses a counterfeit bill gets dead.
Anyone with half a brain that watches the video of the shooting knows he was acting in self defense.
Disgusting
That schmuk work for u guys now. Smh
Love how the media want to portray this young man as a murderer who was acting in self defense and yet they praise BLM and ANTIFA!  Fake media!!
The wife beater and a murderer. That will be the title of my next novel
GOOD!
A real american hero
The young man is an American hero. I hope his conscience rests easy knowing he did the right thing.
Great job Mike and Phil.
What shame! This is what America 🇺🇸 look 👀 weak to other countries! He didn’t even go trial yet!
I mean am I surprised, NO. Glad they're finally taking their masks off, fortunately their days are coming to a close.
Love to smile for a photo op after killing people. Compassion, guilt or empathy are worthless compared to a coffee company.
GOOD. GOD BLESS AMERICA, THE SECOND AMENDMENT. AND THESE PATRIOTS!
Hero
Some of the liberals comments really concern me.
Kyle Rittenhouse has a future in the Republican Party lol
Only downside is he didn't go 3 for 3.
God bless him. We need more people like this in the United states
Imagine that...one felon bails out another
Awesome! Thanks for this great update! Looks like our family is going to get some more pillows to help. Thanks for the update! "and Trump supporter..." Love the activist reporting. LOL
Kyle is an American hero.
SMDH
Genius level advertising by My Pillow Guy
Joe Biden will put back where he belongs......IN PRISON!
If Rittenhouse had stayed home with his rifle he wouldn't have shot an unarmed man. The other people wouldn't have tried to disarm him and two other people wouldn't have been shot.    There was no reason for Rittenhouse to be there.  He put himself in harm's way.  He went to play soldier.
This is awesome news! 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
Disgusting.
American hero
I didn't know Ricky Schroder was mentally ill.
Pillow guy already got sued for false advertising...he uses religion to minipulate people. That kid is a killer I'm sure he has a target on his head.
Haha yes not let em off
Wow horrible
Joe Biden will put him back where he belongs......IN PRISON!
I believe he is being set up by someone. Even I can see he was defending himself but the unlawful carrying charge is gonna stick
WHO LET THE BOTS OUT   BOOP BOOP , BOOP BOOP
Well, Kamala Harris and Okra Winfree have been posting bail for rioters.
The guy he shot who lived should be charged with felony murder of the two that died.
How do they sleep at night? They have a My Pillow ofc
America is going down the tubes. There is no question about it. The only question is why is Trump still alive
Riots incoming
disgusting
Where's the link to purchase my pillow? Must get 4 of them.
The only thing that bothers me more than Kyle Rittenhouse being treated like a criminal is the fact that people are upset that the waste of space Jacob Blake was injured in a shootout he caused.
Waste of 2 million hes going to jail anyways
🙏 for Kyle!
"Trump supporter"... and they say there is no media bias.
He will probably be on Air Force One to Russian with Trump in about sixty something days.
Silver spoons and pillows.....I think that says it all.
Murderer
White Privilege at 💯 percent 😷
The man is free ! 💯💯💯
Kyle drove state line with military weapons to peaceful rally to do what? This is Christian values?
Good for him
so happy he is out!! he should be free.. I might buy a my pillow now
Great news!
He's a true hero in my book. The peace of craps that think they can get away with that Should be put down . You can see  The honesty Protecting people and him Is not a stone cold killer Yes true values.
Jesus 😪
Dam black rifle coffee lol
Based on these comments it appears a lot of you didn’t actually watch the videos and come up with your own opinions
MICHAEL LINDELL IS A GOOD GUY
I should of been name Kyle....that name is popular
Great news. Best wishes.
He should be charged with Reckless endangerment.
And I couldn't post bail for far less...sham
But but he's a killer
Dang as soon as I buy and receive my new pillow I'll sleep great  Great story
Figures a murderer is bailed by thief.  Two pieces of sh**
So glad he got out while awaiting trial. I believe he will he found innocent, and did in fact acted in self defense. 👍🏻🇺🇸
He was released from jail with a sliver spoon in his mouth
awesome!
Kills two men gets the miracle of a lifetime by getting someone to post his bail and poses for a picture with a t shirt saying black rifle coffee company 🤦‍♂️
If anybody seen the videos of the incident that took place, It’s obviously self defense!!!
I can't believe people treat that murder like a hero. It was bad when the right began worshiping George Zimmerman but this is far worse.
It's amazing how the right supports their own, people on the left get a hospital bill or a grave.
Glad to see the Kenosha Kid is going to be ok.
Free him for good!!!!!!   We need justice for Kyle!!!!!!!   No justice no peace!!!!!!!
There shouldnt be bail for murder. It was not self defense, he was underage with a gun, cross states with a gun, in the middle of the night. Then it just so happens 2 people get killed? thats bs
He is a murderer.  Of coarse he was being attacked... we are all told of there is an active shooter to start throwing stuff and go after them.  All active shooters are young white guys.  He shouldn’t have brought a gun to a protest, that is insane.  He bought that gun with his COVID-19 stimulus check.  The kid was wrong in every way.  So sad he became a murderer at 17.
Murder suspect? facckers! he is hero! protectet business from blacks, thugs, murders...he killed not people, he killed creatures...live with it...
Good for the My pillow guy. Kyle should have been given a medal. Not locked up. I'm going to order pillows for everyone in my family today. We do still have a lot of great Americans left. God bless America and President Trump.
God Bless Rittenhouse...
There is something weird about the pillow guy. I guess he can say "That's my boy."
SELF DEFENSE
Yes! AWESOME NEWS! MORE PEOPLE LIKE KYLE AND WE WILL HAVE OUR COUNTRY BACK TOGETHER!
Im just gonna throw this double standards out there. If he was black this would be a whole different story. Same self defense reason, different story people would call him a monster, no fundraiser for bail, they would do anything to lock him up. This is 🇺🇸
I'm buying 5 of those pillows tomorrow
I am so grateful to be alive today. My girlfriend saved my life last night. This is a selfie I took in the emergency room after having a severe allergic reaction to almonds. I went into anaphylaxis, meaning my face, my lips, my eyes, my tongue, and my throat all started swelling up rapidly, making it almost impossible for me to breathe. I also had a rash all over my entire body, and I was extremely red. Staying alive had never felt more difficult. At one point, my nasal passage was completely blocked, and it was getting more and more difficult to breathe. They shot me up with Benadryl, steroids, they gave me a breathing tube, and even other stuff that I can’t even remember, and it caused all of the swelling and the rash to go away. Because this was a severe allergic reaction, I need to continue taking steroids and Benadryl for the next week, because it is possible that the allergic reactions could come back at any point over the next week. The steroids and Benadryl make me feel like a zombie, and I really want to take care of my health, so this will be my main focus over the next week. I want to thank my amazing girlfriend, who made the decision to take me to the emergency room the second I started feeling itchy. I was hesitant about going, because I didn’t even want to believe this was actually happening. If it weren’t for my girlfriend driving me to the emergency room only minutes after eating the almonds, there is a good chance that I wouldn’t have made it according to the doctor. This has been without a doubt the hardest few days of my life, but I also look at them as the most important few days of my life. These moments have reminded me about what’s really important in life, and it has made me so grateful to even be here on this earth. I will be prioritizing my health over the next week, and I’ll post updates about how I feel. Thank you all for being patient during these difficult times. This week has been NUTS (too soon for jokes? 😅)
young patriot we thank you
Disgusting
Is there anyone here willing to admit that some on the other side of things just have a different opinion and weren’t brainwashed? Both sides are so shut off from debate bc they immediately label their opposition as mindless puppets. How would you ever change someone’s mind if your argument is “you’re too unintelligent to see things right” or “you’ve been brainwashed”. I’m not saying those things aren’t problems in today’s world. But most of y’all are just making the divide in this country worse with the rhetoric you’re putting out.
He claims self defense because it was self defense.
Oh God here we go  He WaSnT SuPpOsEd To Be ThErE 🥴
What happened with Mr. Bye-Bye-Bicep?  He was a felon illegally carrying a gun.  Is he in jail now?  I hope so.  He ought to be.
Rittenhouse is a community hero!
What do you mean "claims" he was acting in self defense!
I am absolutely disgusted.
The mockery of this in this comments section shows how stupid the people of America have become to support a 17-year-old murderer.
I get the self defense part. But why did he pick up that big gun and travel out of town to that wild riots scene? That i don't get.
now go help in portland kyle we got you
What's the over/under for bots and programmed algos in the comments.
The kid is a hero! Death to the left!!!!!
God bless this young man! Smart and wise to defend himself lawfully! Thank goodness for true patriots to help him in this time! Kyle will be exonerated from all charges!!
Boy am I glad I’m not so much of a coward that when someone throws a plastic bag at me I shoot them.
Excellent news! Eat your hearts out you satanic leftists!
white privilege at its best, or worst? you decide?
*2 Americans killed by a kid who was not of age to bear arms and crossed two states*  Any other Questions*  ? 😳
Kyle released on bail... Thanks, My Pillow!! 👍👍
Ricky who.....oh yeah another has been trying to be relevant again
Im in general a conservative who suports the second amendment, but when this kid kills someone else I dont wanna hear it. Do your homework people. Research what happend before during and after and you wont like this kid as much
It’s official I’m moving from America this country is worse than a third world country. I’ve seen things here that I’ve never seen a third work country this place is sick.
Watching Silver Spoons reruns while leaning on a My Pillow sounds like a relaxing afternoon right about now.
ASK yourself why? Are this millionaire's help this kid? There's a bunch of other people that murder people and they are not getting Bail out of Jail,  posting a 2 million dollar bail wooooo . Why him?? He shot this dude, and supposedly was out there trying to help people with medical? But when he ended up murdering someone,  he Ran!! He didn't kneel and try to patch him up. If he was so concerned about helping people.  He went out their with the intention of using hes riffle.  When he wasn't supposed to have one.( minor). There's no more law in this country,  our president is a Dictator trying to bribe our electoral officials. The Republicans are so scared of him!! Our Dictator said multiple times he doesn't care about the Americans that are getting covid-19. He's not doing anything about it, instead of working because he is still the president. He's preference to gold😔😔😔 what a disgrace .
Good. KEEP RITTENHOUSE FREE!
I knew they would let him walk he acted in self  defense Kyle would  been killed  had he not defended  himself
WE LOVE YOU KYLE IM SO PROUD OF OUR TRUE PATRIOT 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
Sounds about white
I will never buy any more products from this company  again
if you read the charges from the prosecutor it almost sounds like they know it was self defense.   move on
"Its good to finally see some action" - JC Denton
This kid is going to get some time. His ignorance is going to set him way back in life. He had no right to even be out there at 17 years old with a firearm. He was no where near experienced enough in firearms or life, so his ignorance is going to cost him some year's being locked up.
So, the My Pillow guy is good with folks shooting others down? Good to know... his pillow won’t stop a bullet.
Cellphone video shows he WAS acting in self defense.....
He never should've been in jail to begin with
He should've never been charged to begin with.
This boy has a bullseye on him like 69 both deserve a dirt nap
YOOOOO, that’s pretty dope, he shouldn’t be locked up for life for that.
Guess we need to boycott My Pillow
Think I lost brain cells reading these pro murder comments
since when are you allowed bail when you are facing murder charges? OJ didn't even get that treatment
WANNA BE PATRIOT   TOTAL FAKE  IF HE'S SO GUNG HO WHY DONT HE JOIN THE MILITARY HES A COMPLETE COWARD
Biased newwwws lol
Good ‼️
Man you really couldn’t write this stuff. This is south park level writing 😂😂
Good, that boy needs to be free.
Way to go Mike and Rick!  New order coming your way Mike.
The Kenosha Killer
Unbelievable underage 17yr old goes across state lines to a protesters rally. With an illegal Assault Rifle shoots 3 people killing 2 of them. How is that self defense? Cherry on top... A Trump supporter bails out this murderer. Wtf? 🗣️
based
Based
Shame u even had the audacity to make this as news
At a Very young age Kyle Rittenhouse is a True Genuine hero of the 2nd Amendment who should be applauded👏 for holding his own against antifa Thugs
The sociopaths in the comments who support Kyle Rittenhouse’s murder of those two un-armed protesters need Jesus Christ in their lives.  I will continue to pray for this nation.  🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Murderer
Had to throw in that he’s a trump supporter 😂
Good for him
He doesn’t have to claim anything. We have a dozen videos to prove he was acting in self defense.
I was wondering how he got 2 million to post bail,,,came from the My Pillow guy? Lmao
A real hero..not afraid of urban terrorist
YOU ARE 🐑🐑🐑🐑😷🐑😷🐑😷🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑😷😷😷🐑‼️‼️‼️‼️🎯 WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP 😴💤💤😴💤😴 ALL BIDEN VOTERS =🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑😷😷😷🐑🐑🎯🎯🎯‼️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽UR BEING PROGRAMMED BY YOUR 👹LUCIFERI🔼N 👁️WNED AND 👁️PERATED FAKE LAMESTREAM MEDIA
Now the sociopaths are going to go  around and provoke people and then shoot them and claim self defense.
Free Kyle now NBC sucks
White privilege
A Racist will turn on a White victim just to push they're cause. If this kid was black and went to a trump protest rally. Then, Shot a supporter fearing for his life,  your energy would be different.    Speak     Truth.👊🏼
Good I’m glad he’s out he didn’t murder anyone he acted in self defense
The National Guard should have been defending the people and businesses from the violent destructive hoodlums instead of an out of state teenager. An armed trained security force should have been protecting Kenosha. Kyle was too young to understand the savage deranged individuals who were wrecking death and destruction in Kenosha. I am glad he was successful in defending his life. But he was in over his head in entering an anarchy zone like Kenosha were authorities had lost control and anarchists were rampaging.
first day out after killing someone and his shirt already has progun phrasing on it.
Since when do killers get bail
These comments make you realize how many sociopaths live around us lol
Kyle is a hero. Wiping the earth from commie scum one at a time.
Human garbage. All three of them.
This means the guy in Colorado who killed a bear mace crazed right wingers is bout to be released.
Good for Kyle. If more patriots would take a stand like this, this wouldnt have happened. But Kyle is white, and a conservative. he is a political prisoner.
He is a murderer and should be found guilty by a jury of his peers or plead out. However, all citizens deserve constitutional rights in America, but not everyone can afford bail.
Ricky Schroeder and the My Pillow guy, what a dream team, LMAO... Those pillows were trash btw. When are we going to see Trump tweet about how courageous this punk is? What a joke.
Is this true? I hope so its a disgrace what's happened to that kid
Good now take further action to dismiss case's. These riots should of never happened with piling evidence of votes being miss handle. The lefty's are going to go ham on civilians because they are uncivilized president donald Trump 2021 breaking the chain's on our constitutional right to a fair vote process. Sorry not sorry patriot proud amen 🇺🇸
He killed a couple pedophiles and shot a felon in the arm, after running away from them, Yet he's the bad guy?
Guess they wouldn't be smiling if it been someone in their family he had murdered.
Iv seen the footage   justifiable homicide even to the blind The way things are rite now He is safer inside God be with ya kyle
It’s about time  He should have never been in jail for defending his own life!!!!
Hopefully, Kyle stays out of jail. The media is ruining lives and people have to wake up. They don't understand that Kyle is not just a normal person, he's a KID. And the fact that the media is playing such a big role in deciding whether a person lives free or in prison forever just because the media organization doesn't like their beliefs scares me as should it scare every American.
Trump2024!
Nice to know, i will never purchase anything from this scum bag.
Sometimes I wonder if we are just in an episode of Black mirror
Love to see this
It took this long because Go Fund Me accounts only support criminals evidently....
Well no purchasing of My Pillow in my household!
Self defense he should not be CHARGED!!
FACT: Man brings AR-15 to riot.  Gets chased by rioters also with guns and blunt objects that do not let him leave the scene.  Man shoots only people pointing a Glock and slamming a skateboard at the back of his head while on the ground.  TODAY'S Fact: Here are the murder loving Trump supporters you should hate, cancel and persecute.
Do you guys know what self defense is? No but just bcuz he's white you guys look at him differently, losers
Enjoy your freedom while you have it. Celebrity fades, when you are another inmates boyfriend 18months from now & no one takes your calls you will have learned a very adult lesson. Get on PreExp meds now.
What a waste of money and what a waste of oxygen.
Why doesTHIS not surprise me??? But Ricky Schroeder?? All those 70's and 80's boy kid stars are a real disappointment in the morals department. First Baio, now Schroeder. Ewwww.
He's too cool for bail...but he will not escape jail. Punk is unemployed...and that's a good thing.
The my pillow guy is a true patriot!  So is mr shroader!
They know he is innocent! Nice moves gentlemen! I need a MY PILLOW asap
He took a stand, trying to defend senseless destruction against pos rioters who don't know what they're "protesting" about and then had to defend himself.
I got 1 year in jail for carrying a loaded gun..Never had the pleasure of using it.  Ruined my attempt to get a decent job after that. This guy gets freed and paid for killing two people.  Amazing!
If he had killed a member of my family, I guarantee he wouldn't be smiling...
Steal ✍️ from ✍️ MyPillow ✍️
I'm getting a new pillow and the Silver Spoons DVD set.
Since when do you get a homicide charge for self defense? Watch the videos ya dimdems.
GOOD FOR HIM...SWEEEET...
Our own day's Johnny Tremaine.  Awesome young man--everything the Boy Scouts should be teaching men to be.  Anybody threatens him threatens me and all America.  RLTW.
I hope people remember what he did, and treat him horribly~<3
I don't agree with him crossing state lines, but he shot in self defense. Very clear in the video and other videos that have come out.
he is 100% going to jail...self defense of who? look at the tape....
WELL...we KNOW for certain he WILL NOT EVER have a job...unless he can use "My Pillow Guy's" mouth for a change maker.
Welcome home Kyle!
America,  Wow
Hopefully covid gets them both lmao
It would be a presumption that My Pillow is about to take a stock hit.
Are you kidding me? I hear a civil war ringing out!
Good for him  He should not be in jail for defending hinself
Wonderful!! True justice will set him free. 👍
American hero
This dude is going to be really popular in prison.

Thank you mr lindell
My pillow guy was trying to fleece Americans with a fake coronavirus cure-and the few competent people in government stopped him-the former crackhead should be in prison with righteous rittenhouse-the scourge of American society those two-
He shouldn't even be facing charges. The people he defended himself against are felons and pedophiles.
This guy is a killer
Why are they letting a dangerous criminal who killed 3 people out on bail? What if he goes to another protest? A cop just gunned down two teenagers yesterday point black.
The kid that did what we pay taxes to have done by the so-called Authorities !
I hope he stays out! He was defending himself.
God bless you Son , Jesus loves you , you're in my prayers...
Murderer!!!
https://rumble.com/vaqret-q-we-are-the-plan-official.html
This is upsetting!! They wouldn’t have allowed him bail if he were black.
Woohoo!
America is crazy i see why its falling lol you celebrate a kid who murders 2 people makes you look like the Demons Farrakhan warned us about im glad we have cameras now a days because the world has proof thats why there time is up ☝
Little Ricky Schroeder. lol what a tool
Kyle for mayor!
They make me sick
It's just bail, so he doesn't have to sit in jail while he waits for a trial.  Nothing's actually happened.
Hallelujah!!! 🙌🏻🇺🇸
Hmmm...a so called religious man supports murderers...my pillow sucks anyways.
Welcome to American Justice 2020.
Mr. Pillow, I hope you sleep well at night knowing you support a killer that took 2-lives.
If you watch the videos it’s clearly self defense without question. Boggles my mind how people who know nothing about what actually happened and just rely on what others said about the incident spread their claims that he just blatantly murdered 2 people. I’ve never seen a clearer case of self defense
This goes to show what the far left media led you to believe. This young man shouldn't have had any weapons, however, he really wanted to help curtail the violence that actual adults were perpetrating on others, including children. So the media shows you Kyle walking around like he's looking for someone to shoot. What the media doesn't show you is that he was being chased by these violent goons. The actual shootings took place in self defense. So this child is set up like a mass murderer, when he just wanted to help. Give me a break people. You hate Trump (because of indoctrination of the far left and far left media), so of course, Trump gets brought into this. Thank you, Mike and Ricky, for reaching out and helping this young man. If you cry racism, too, because of your statements that this white boy will get such and such help. b.s. Reverse racism I say to you. There are plenty of videos out there that show the whole story. If Kyle hadn't shot those people, he would have been killed. Self defense!
American patriot hero and good citizen.
A 17 year old double murder has a fan group of very generous psychopaths.
As if the My Pillow guy couldn't generate LESS credibility for himself.   (S)elect a clown/expect a circus.
Taking a Life is taking a life.  Me personally ... I wouldnt be Posing for a pic with a smile on my face. I would still feel terrible even though it was justified
This is great news, stay strong Kyle.. we patriots are all praying and rooting for you, we know you did what you had to do to survive..
Ironically ,that is the same pillow used to smother Epstein in his jail cell
People love the criminally insane.
Racism has endless boundaries no pillows for me thanks
Been praying for Kyle to be helped get released when I heard his bail was $2mil
Kyle , why do you look happy? It is not like you are vindicated of MURDER...you just get to go home awaiting trial, get ready to rot in PRISON, punk .
Kyle Rittenhouse is my hero and i stand behind him!!!
"Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account." (Hebrews 4:13)  LORD THANK YOU THAT YOU ARE A GOD OF MERCY and JUSTICE and both will be served. In Jesus' NAME ...AMEN!!!  "For God so loved the world that He gave His Only Son, that whosoever BELIEVES in Him would not perish but have ETERNAL LIFE!" JOHN 3:16  It's quite simple, but a stubborn heart of unbelief blocks Salvation. But if You are willing...God is READY and WAITING...  "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved." Romans 10:9-10 💞✝
Fake news channel
I hope karma does it’s job. Either someone takes him out or he goes back to jail. And for got this time.
POS!!!!
not that i would ever drink black rifle coffee, because the website reeks of right wing fascism and gun worship, but their logo now on right wing murder celebrity kyle rittenhouse seals the deal forever and a day. i'm not saying the kid doesn't deserve his day in court, but people who would finance the bail and publicly put their name to it deserve what they have coming. which, now that i think about it, is probably millions in pillow sales from right wing cult members. murder for profit--can it GET any more american???????
No longer a fan of Ricky Schroeder who is all smiles standing along side of a killer that took 2-lives.
Green light
Thank you, Mike Lindell and Rick Schroder.  In the world we live in where rapists and pedophiles are protected and glorified, but this young man, Kyle Rittenhouse is nearly crucified for shooting 3 people in self defense, it gives me hope for our country that there are still people here who are willing to step up when necessary.  May God Bless you both.
When drywall just isn’t enough anymore..
CLEAR CUT SELF DEFENSE I SAW THE VIDEO, CLEAR CUT CASE OF AMERICAN HEROISM!!!
He claims lol there is video that proves his statement.. glad to see him out
Disgusting
No HE WAS ACTING IN SELF DEFENSE!!!!! GET YOUR STORY CORRECT.
Kyle is based and red pilled
Video evidence proves he was acting in self defense. It's not a claim. The prosecutor falsely claims intentional homicide, while holding concrete evidence that their claim is false. It's worse than claiming something without evidence. It's a claim in contradiction to the evidence.
THIS KID IS GOING TO WISH HE WAS BACK IN JAIL !!!!
His next stop is at the White House to be awarded the Medal of Freedom.
Doubling down on divisions #2020
Good for him. Congrats Kyle. 🇺🇸
I was born in Kenosha these locals try to watch out for each other not like the out of town looters oprttunists thugs
The kid is a true Nazi Meriakkkan hero.  $$$AMEN JE$$$U$$$   Ble$$$ me Pastor BUCK$$$$
There it is. This hate runs wet in every corner. Let's see what happens judicially
Enjoy your short stint of freedom chump. You are still going to jail. Hopefully general. They'll know how to give you star treatment there ...
Corporate-Funded Right Wing Child Soldier In A Trump America Walks The Streets Freely.  More Accurate Title.
i call for reckless child endangerment charges on his mother for putting him in a life or death situation armed with a gun .... he was a minor and therefore should not of been on the streets at night armed eith an automatic weapon ... thats what is wrong here.
Self defense. What the commies hate.
Sounds white
These mutherfuckers are despicable
Never was a fan of My Pillow.... think I may purchase one now
Good for him.
Bail is a joke. It's a bribe to get out of jail
That Lindell guy is a total nut job.
Disgusting
God bless America and its True patriots... George floyd was BLM's hero, Kyle Rittenhouse is my hero!!! 🙌
Kyle’s gonna be biting his pillow once he’s in prison.
Boycott Mr. Pillow......starting today
My new favorite pillow! This kid stood up to thugs better than our politicians and police do. He’s a hero in my opinion.
So...he left the comfort of his home with a loaded assault firearm and drove hours away to point it at a crowd to act in self defense? Umm....yeah
you know demotards will try to cancel MyPillow now lol
This kid is a hero and will be remembered as one
I'm ordering pillows for the entire family.
It wouldn't be self defense if he didn't have that gun. Because he wouldn't even been there if he didn't have that gun. So self defense don't count. He came there for something.
Kyle Rittenhouse, an American hero.
Love that fact that everyone congratulating a murderer.
Ricky is a nutjob Trumper? Well, TIL....
hope he enjoys his time out of jail because he will be convicted of murder and will get a long jail sentence for his crimes. this should be a easy case for procuters.
WoW.. LOL...smh
yup, time to boycott
That white boy is a crazy killer. Forget white supremacy. Hahaha lame af
He’s a marked man  someone will take him out
Trump will never be president again😂 thank god. Go Joe Biden🕺🏽🌍
What happened to the 369,000.00 go fund me money that they raised for him right after he turned himself in. I pray for the families who are involved,and ask a very important question, " DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILD IS ?" As crazy as this world is, he might have bee. safer in jail. People's will never understand this until they are confronted with it.
Kyle did nothing wrong
Self defense obviously
Self defense offends them, unless you're a protester burning a building down.
Kyle did the world a favor and dropped 2 looser RIOTERS.  One was a women beating FELON, other was a child predator FELON
Vanilla isis is out
Should’ve never been put in jail in the first place.
Yes!!!! He is a true American hero!!!! He should have never been charged!!!!
This disgusting He killed two people with powerful rifle Not old enough to have a gun in the 1st place The police allowed him to carry a gun  His parents allowed him as well  If this was a black 17 yr old boy he would still be sitting in jail What America We live in  I said what I said my opinion So all you haters who don't like what I said  Bye Felicia😁
The kid is unstable.
THE MEDIA ALWAYS PLAY DIRTY TRICKS “ Tupac
Black rifles matter.
A black man with a rifle insight like that would have been dead. Sad. He supposed to stay home. How many protesters had rifles like that?
Kyle can join my militia any day.  Cool under pressure.
He should've stayed home that night and killed as many people as he wanted...on a VIDEO GAME.  He'd still be home on his couch, safe and sound.  Lock him up!!!
MORE PEOPLE SHOULD START SHOOTING RAPISTS , PEDOPHILES AND KIDNAPPERS
He is innocent.
You have the right to disagree with whether or not what he did was murder but EVERYONE is entitled to their day in court to defend themselves. DEFENSE is going to be a key word here because I believe had these two shitheads hadn't chased the kid down they might still be alive. Those crazy bums would have seriously injured or killed Kyle and he had a right to defend himself, likewise he has the duty to defend his actions.  Whether or not he was unlawfully in posession of the rifle well that is a separate issue. To disparage anyone trying to help the kids fight the legal charges is shameful, just another nutty leftist attempt to trash and smear individuals whom dont share your values and beliefs. I firmly believe liberals, leftists, marxists, nuts, or whatever they think they are would rather the country abandon its constitution and bill of rights in favor of their faux utopian authoritarian rule.
This is a disgrace.
Watch the video they attacked more then one to see just mob chasing slammed with skateboard hit from behind handgun pointed at you self defense a kid trying to help out and protect someone's business and you choose to attack me how 🤔  do you know what I believe you don't typical myopic response
They shouldn't have arrested him anyway. It sucks how messed up our justice system is 😕
Hey Rickey !  Hollywood just called and said they killed your career, They claimed they were acting in self defence !
What about Kyle, the child?  Guilty or innocent he took the lives of two people.  Before we use this child to fight causes on either side, can we stop and reflect what this publicity does in the eyes and minds of him and other juveniles?   The last thing this CHILD needs is to be flaunted publicly, wearing a rifle T-shirt, as if nothing happened to or by him.  Our other children are watching, America.
No my pillows for Christmas for sure! I'd like see where " my pillow" goes as  a company mid 2021 🤣🤣🤣
Yessssss my HERO is free!!!!!!!!! 👍🏾
He WAS acting in self defense. Watch the videos Today! Phony news BS
THIS WILL ONLY KEEP THE FIRE BURNING ✊✊✊✊RISE UP AGAINST BIGOTRY . SELF DEFENSE !!! TAKE THAT PILLOW AND PUT  IT UP YOUR @SS !!! CRACK HEAD !!!
STOP THE STEAL!!! PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL SERVE A SECOND TERM!! THE DOMINION COMPUTER VOTE SYSTEM BOUGHT FROM VENEZUELA WAS EMPLOYED TO COMMIT FRAUD!!!!
How about y'all donate 2 million to George Floyd's family. 🙄
I knew there was something wrong with that kid from silver spoon. You could tell someone screw him when he was a little boy, he had that walk. Him  and that my pillow guy are both trump lovers and want to have his kids.  Just like trump they are losers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes amazing man glad he got out he deserves to be let out
Hey mom, I'm going to the protest with an unregistered gun so that I can "act in self defense". I'll be back next week when the rich white establishment bails me out of jail and calls me a hero.
Wow what a crazy team the little brat for that 80's show Silver Spoons and the crazy My Pillow guy. I guess the Shamwow  guy was to busy.
nothing surprises me anymore
YOU WOULD SAY THAT HES A TRUMP SUPPORTER SMH I HATE YOU
Yay
I love it when the liberal media is shut down
Self Defense is NOT a crime. Rittenhouse has been freed!
Driving into a town where you don't live to protect 'property that isn't yours, then shooting at and killing people...what happened to the sanctity of life? Prolife until someone steals a 📺? Gtfohwtbs
Why do I think this kid's not done with trouble?
Good. He never should have been locked up anyway. Theres enough video evidence showing he acted in self defense.
The guy shot in self defense.  We saw the video.
There is no JUSTICE in this country, specially if you can buy your way out of everything. Disgusting, and My Pillow guy you will reap what you sow, bye pillow co. Rick Schroder no respect, you to will reap what you sow.
Honestly, whatever you believe... the fact that this guy killed two people, and he's in this photo smiling, is crazy!
Good for him ! He's a hero!  Took care of some of those dirtbag low-lifes. Did society a favour. Wooooooo !
#Rittenhousedidnothingwrong.
I think today is the day that I will buy some new pillows
the my pillow guy must've been low on ratings shrug it does happen lol #Life
Too bad you guys can't cancel the my pillow guy even though you'd like too lol....funny how celebs set up a bond fund for rioters though
Good, thank you Mr. Michael Lindell and Ricky Schroder.  You are truly one of the good guys.
Kyle did nothing wrong!
K A R M A WILL COME BACK TO BITE
This is proof that we're in a fight of good and evil.  Makes me sick.
This is GREAT News, unlike the Fake News Media Keep up the good work
I will never buy a pillow from that guy again
WHEN U R A LOSER DEPLORABLE AND UR LIFE IS POINTLESS U OWN A GUN AND U DONT CARE IF U LIVE RRST OF UR SAD LIFE IN PRISON
Yes! He was a hero, not a terrorist!
For anyone with an IQ below room temperature, it was self-defense, period. Watch the tape.
Kyle should never have been arrested in the first place.
Unbelievable. Americans seem a bit screwed up in the head. No doubt why no else in the World cares to support the idiocy. Scary days ahead for one and all.
Amen!
Kyle Rittenhouse is not a murderer and he is not a hero. He did what he had to do to survive in the given situation, the others did not.
Are you f**king kidding me?!
Knowing the history of this country…nothing surprises me!!!!!
Boycott my pillow and schroeder!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ricky got money to bale out the family member who got killed?.... OOPS WRONG COLOR SPOON
A 17 year old going to jail for the rest of his life is considered a win by trump supporters.
I am so glad for kyle he is innocent and so far has been treated very unjustly. Theywouldn't  like it if this happend to their kid.
Wow. Well he won't be out for long! Murder is Murder!
hey, isnt this the guy that shot three innocent protesters, then cleaned up paint, to make himself look better to the public's eye?
I- if any of you wanna join me on a remote island off the coast of Australia, lmk
A black man ran around his house and two white men killed him. why?
Yooooo nice  Kyle did nothing wrong  Cry about it 😂
Killer on the loose!
it's about time
this kid was attacked by far left wing radicals, one with a gun and did what he had to do to defend his life,i consider this young man a hero
Okay fk my pillow and trumpers
IF I OWNED ONE OF HIS PILLOWS I WOULD BURN IT.  TO KEEP THIS NUT JOB AND HIS MOTHER FROM GUNNING DOWN OTHERS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SET FREE THE YOUNG TEEN FROM THE U.K. FREE SAW THE EVILNESS IN TRUMP AND CAME ACROSS THE POND TO SAVE AMERICANS HE ISIMPRISONED FOREVER IS NO LONGER JUSTICE WHILE TRUMP IS AT THE HELM.
Self defense is not a crime!!! Give that kid a medal!
SO WHAT   HE WILL BE LOCKED UP FOREVER SOON
The evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of self-defense. That's not the problem for his case. The problem is that the prosecution won't try to argue against self-defense directly. They will argue that he broke the law by carrying the rifle and therefore his claims to self-defense are invalid. I think the key will be to defend that he was lawful in carrying the rifle in the first place. But we'll see. I personally hope he gets off.
Enjoy your moment of freedom punk! You are going to jail for the rest of your life!!!
mypillow getting free advertisement...smart move
Not buying a My Pillow. Good people need guns because of people like Kyle Rittenhouse.
Great for Kyle,  and now I will go buy a pillow!
Boycott both of these has-been
Good news
PUNK.......
The kid repeatedly tried to get away. It was self-defense.
He's guilty!!!
Man all these comments saying he should be in jail yet ignore the fact he shot a pedophile. Shameful how many people are ok with touching kids smh.
This is the age where someone would blame the stove if a kid touched it while it was hot and ask for it to apologize publicly after being sued and then have assault stoves outlawed. Don't want to get shot? Maybe try protesting peacefully and don't charge the guy with a gun and try out some common sense and personal responsibility. They knew the risks and made their choice. Kyle took out some trash, good riddance. BTW, my truck is powered by offended snowflakes and Karens.
Lawless country he was caught on tape shooting 2 people
Anyone who actually watched the videos would know, with 100% certainty, that this was a cut-and-dry case of self defense. Everyone else is an obnoxious gun-hating, Trump-hating, white-hating Leftist drone who didn't even watch the actual footage, they're just letting their emotions run the show.
Protest? That's rioting!
great, now hes going to be out killing more people who try and attack him.
cults are real.
Anybody else boycotting my pillow? Or is it jus gon be me🤷🏽‍♂️
He murdered 2 black men with an assault weapon he illegally transported into another state.  OF COURSE he's a conservative hero, and of course My Pillow guy paid his bail.  Disgusting.
Idk, maybe it actually was self defense. I'll probably get a lot of hate for this, but has anyone actually bothered to look at all the evidence? There was a RIOT. His life easily could have been in danger. I'm not saying either way...but if I were in the jury I would at least hear all the evidence before jumping to conclusions.
Self-defense, against innocent unarmed people. That's like jailing a picnicker for being mauled by a bear, and then calling the bear a hero.
This is a joke if that was any other race besides whites it would of never happen he still be locked up
Wow!
Boycott My Pillow!
sounds about white, white privilege doesnt exist huh
That's cool. Wanted to burn my "my pillows anyways"!
God Bless this young man. He stood up to the mob.
So the poor kid that was defending himself from a bunch of criminals finally got out of jail.  He should never have been arrested in the first place.
This is awesome!! Kyle rittenhouse is a hero!!
Little devil
Fools
He shouldn’t have been in jail in the first place.
He shouldn't have put himself in that situation!!!!!!!
Doing major research and realizing most whte people dont have spirits or souls, VERY PROFOUND stuff im finding!
The guy is a murderer, there was a time when that was frowned upon and people would not be associated with one. Leave it to the White supremacists and Republicans to make one a hero
Never bought a my pillow looks like i never will be
This kids the next Steven Crowder
Its incredible how being underage with an assault weapon that didn't belong to you and be able to utilize it in another state is now not a crime. Let's say underage Pookie from Chicago borrowed an assault weapon in Indiana, shoots 3 and kills 2, would he be treated the same way? If you said yes, you are a lying S.O.S.
"protest" HAHAHAHAHHAHA, thats the funniest thing i think I've ever heard on this channel.
As usual people act as arm chair judges from their computer screens. This kid is a hero and represents the right to defend his life.
Good to see him out, should never have been charged with murder. Clearly self defense.
Great news.  Looking forward to the acquittal.  🇺🇸
NEVER my pillow.
The law is clear and transparent for cases like this.   A civilian should not be out in the streets, in another state, trying to exert justice.
Gonna be out that money, dude is going to jail for the rest if his life.  His mother is also going to do a bunch of time. My Pillow will not recover from this scandal.
Disgusting
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A FORMER CRACK HEAD TURNED CEO OWNER OF A MALTY  MILLION DALLOR BUSINESS  .
Not even old enough to have a gun, hope he’s in prison for 30 years. Wtf are you doing bringing an ar to a protest, no good intentions when you do that. Youre a kid, and you should be afraid.
If this guy had been black or Hispanic, they would have already been 6 feet underground..and that's all I have to say..
yayyyyyyyy
Free my boy he didn’t do nothin
Kyle Rittenhouse will not be convicted of murder. The most they can do is charge him for carrying a weapon while being underage, which is a misdemeanor. The video coverage shows conclusively that Kyle was repeatedly attacked and was trying to retreat.
Good for him... he deserves to be home, I hope his trial goes well for him.
He shouldn't be in jail in the first place.   The scums of the world live by the sword and they died by the sword.  Don't cause violence or attack without provocation, and you won't die.
Kid deserves a award for taking out the trash in Kenosha!
Exposing yourself voluntarily to potential life and death situations is not acting in self defense. Staying home and doing your homework and chores around the house instead of playing with guns in acting in self defense.
How bout he was acting in self defense lol
if he cared for his community he wouldnt had shot those 2 people its not hard to run home or to police.
Freee Kyle rittenhouse 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He killed a r*pist and a p*dophile. Why are people angry at him?
Beautiful!!!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!
This young man is a killer. What a sick country, stop glorifying him. Shame on you.
Good, it was self defense.
How does this kid even have a 2 million dollar bail when there is so much video on the incident that's undisputably self-defense.  In fact the guy who got his bicep blown into mist has even been arrested and charged with attempted murder and illegal possession of firearm because he shot first and had an illegal gun.
Mike Lindell's thoughts on the shootings?   *"Sleep tight commies."*
Kyle Rittenhouse should never have been able to take funds for a bail release for someone who is charged with 1st Degree Murder.  Only in White America is this sort of injustice continuing.  This is why the Black Lives Matter Movement must continue.  Systemic racism has infected our Judicial System like the Covid-19 Pandemic.  I'm embarrassed to be an American born citizen.  It is outrageous that the DOJ goes easy on White Nationalists, supremacists and people of wealth.  It violates our Constitution in terms of Equality Under the Law.  I am utterly revolted at this news.  This is NOT what the United States of America was intended to become.
Sickening, murderers are glorified now
We love Kyle
Yes! Gotta love the Kenosha Kid!
White pillow man  confirming that he’s racist ..
What time is the parade?
No matter what my political views are, I will stay as far away from these violent Riots as possible. Only bad things are happening there. They are not good or safe places to be. Stay home and stay safe.
Disgusting!
silver spooooones wtf
Only in common day America can you protect your town and your own life against deadly force and go to jail.
MY PILLOW  FOUNDER WILL NOT BE GETTING MY MONEY ANY MORE. HE NEEDS TO STAY IN JAIL. WTF IS WRONG WITH SOME PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD? HE SHOULD BE THROWN BACK IN JAIL TIL HIS COURT DATE
And he's smiling as if he didn't shoot two people. America, the true s%*#@hole country.
Things like this need to happen so people can know who to banish.
Woooooo I am buyin my pillows!
This 17 year old boy had no buisness carrying an AR-15 on the pretense of being an EMG. He wasn't old enough to buy the gun, had no training for stressful situations, and wasn't a trained EMG. If this boy really felt the need to help anyone injured then why carry an AR? There are many to blame for this tragedy. The man who bought the gun( in the state where I live the gun laws are loose but buying a gun for someone else is a crime. This crime is punishable by ten years in prison.) The store owner is at fault. He was alright, with a green behind the ears kid, guarding his property with a gun. Property can be replaced, lives cannot. The police were most at fault. Why is it alright to let anyone with an AR do your job. The police are supposed to be trained how to act and handle stressful situations. This 17 year old boy had probably shot still targets but that is miles away from the adrenaline and pressure that comes from actual live action. A lot of trained police fail at this time, as is evident by the many videos I have seen where trained officers freeze and their muscle memory does not serve them because their training is not extensive enough. All said the boy didn't need a gun. I heard him say in an interview that he didn't regret having an AR because he would have been dead If not for his gun. There was no call for that underage child to be there. There was no call for anyone but trained public servants to be there. This country is on the verge of its demise and no one seems to care. The answer is never going to be found in guns and hatred, but I know I am talking to deaf ears.
Rittenhouse for the marines
Let's goooo
THIS IS PLAIN AND SIMPLE . THE KID TOOK A GUN TO SHOOT AT A PEACEFUL PROTEST . THAT IS PREMEDITATED !!!! 2 COUNTS OF PREMEDITATED MURDER . GOOD LUCK ON THE OUTSIDE KID .
I lost all respect for Ricky Schroder!  The my pillow guys already a piece of crap!
There's 3 things in this world that just don't hang themselves ...  1. Christmas ornaments 2. Drywall 3. Jeffery Epstein
pathetic and disgusting wow but not surprising from a dumb trumper
It should NEVER have taken so long or a bond so ridiculously high. Antifa & blm terrorists prance in & out while doing real damage & this child acted in self defense with straight forward hard evidence. Sickening! God bless Kyle & may the corrupt courts free him of all charges.
You mean the teen charged for defending himself from BLM rioters.
Thank you,Mike, thank you Rick!! God bless you for helping Kyle out. It was clearly self defence.
Doesn't take away his crimes so let them waste they money and ruin they brands over this foolishness
He’s a killer he killed two people and they treat him like a hero he should get life in prison
God bless you Kyle and God bless the second amendment. You clearly defended yourself from those American hating Little commie thugs .
He is a killer period!
If he was named Rashad rittenhouse they would have let him rot
Good.  Nobody with a shred of decency and anything between their ears feels bad that a kiddy diddler and two violent felons (rap sheets full of domestic abuse and assault charges, one of whom was in _felony possession_ of the Glock he pointed at Kyle) got ventilated while they attacked Kyle for the offense of helping to put out their _dumpster fire they tried to roll through a gas station_ in their efforts to destroy innocent people's livelihoods.   You can throw a rock in these riot crowds with a 50/50 chance of hitting a violent felon and/or kiddy diddler, but I should be mad a few got burned by somebody with a rifle a few months short of being legally allowed to carry it? Right.  Imagine actually absolving violent rioters of moral agency as they prey on innocent people's livelihoods while treating people who stand up to them like criminal scum. Only literal human trash would think in such an upside down framework.
The two that were killed—were they part of the community or were they shipped in to make trouble. I’m tired of thugs ruining our country.  I wish they would all be shot. Since no one can go to jail these days.
This American hero was being chased by a pedophile who tried to go for his gun he tried to deescalate by running away but then was bashed in the head by a skateboard and he defended himself end of story💯🇺🇸
Was this posted by the Onion?
Someone should 👉 the my pillow guy!
fake news
HOW DISGUSTING!
yikes
Now this killer will make a book 📚 sale and make millions  💰. Watch out 👀.
I say self defense
is our society even worth it anymore? I mean what is the point.....if this is where we are going we do not deserve to exist.....flush the toilet already and let Earth heal from this evolutionary mistake called man.
We need like 50k more people with brass balls right now.
Murderer bailed out by racist garbage person. There, fixed your headline.
This good. Give him a taste of freedom so when he goes back to jail he will cry MAGA tears just like Trump supporters when their dear leader is evicted Jan 20th
"and Trump supporter" "claims he was acting in self defence"  Yeah I think getting shot at and thrown to the ground by an violent mob warrants some self defence.
Now he has even more reason to sleep well at night.
Thank you Mr. Lindell and every other contributor to this important cause.  This brave young man is not a murderer.  While he might be guilty of some minor firearms regulation breaches his actions were entirely defensive.  The two aggressors he killed and the one he injured were clearly asking for what they got and Kyle has already paid a painful price for his technical violations.
Self defense is still a Constitutionally  protected right! Sorry children
He will get his day in court in front of his peers. That is how it works.
About time!  This brave kid should be getting a metal for bravery. It's sad the cops wouldn't do their jobs and a 17 yr old kid had too.
I need to walk through a KKK rally with my AR-15 and act in only self-defense.
Why did he protest in a city that was not his
You have got to be kidding me.  That kid is a menace to society.
When is the guy that pulled a gun on Kyle gonna get charged?
Under age Rittenhouse who shouldn't have had a weapon in his possession in the first place let alone killing two people and seriously wounding one crossing state lines will be going to jail. Those two misfits who bail him out wasted their money. And that My MyPillow guy I believe he's going to go out of business.
Good he’s an American hero
I think the U.S. needs to make it's mind up about laws. In the government's eyes he was not mature enough to drink or gamble, but mature enough to go arm himself and play hero. I am not saying his intentions were wrong, and had every right to defend himself when the mob started running him down. I just don't think a we should have kids out there playing hero....don't we have enough grown men for that? Many teens are arrogant, we really do not know what led up to the incident prior to cameras rolling. Was he doing the right thing and trying to deescalate or was he running his mouth? We will never know.
Kyle did nothing wrong
targeted, attacked, justified. this issue seems more about the criminal clinton crews activist agendas and democrat funded illegal activities unable to impress america beyond the lying ford flopped press priorities, as opposed to pillows.
He kills 2 people in cold blood and he is considered a hero? He is mental and needs help not to be let loose.
Time to buy a my pillow
In two weeks he will be dead from COVID 😂🤣
No pretty sure if you watch all of the videos any intelligent individual can blatantly gather it was self defense and the terrorist acts of others needed to be put down by any force necessary....
Welp.  Glad I don’t own a my pillow
Good, he never should have been locked up.
I’m buying some My Pillow products ASAP.
As much as I think it was stupid for this kid to be out running the streets like a wanna be vigilante call of duty couch potato, all the video evidence shows this was self defense at its finest.
I agree with the Florida governor
Yes, they pat him on the back as though his killing of 2 people was a "sport" to be proud of. This is the "true nature" of the trump supporters.
I have a my pillow.  I will never support this company again. There is a reason his bail was so high, he is a danger to society, will probably be convicted,  and is a flight risk.
I mean you can’t have your future store mass shooter in training locked up, how will he practice
#notmypillow
Kid is clearly innocent. No doubt it was self defense. Unfortunately we have political trials in this country now.
so glad to see you home my brother,,,,,big up people,,,it's time,,,,,,,☃
i love how people on the news say claimes it was in self defense, but never showing the video of the rioters coming at him hitting him in the head with a skateboard and knocking him to the ground and trying to take the rifle
Shouldn't have came to a protest with a long rifle trying to intimate people you screwed up and are trying to blame others for your stupidity
What a bunch of heathens when killing someone is funny smh.
Excellent!
Don't forget to get the my pillow guy  too, he deserves it!
Self defense is exactly what the video shows.  Dont expect fake news to tell anyone the truth
My pillow guy is a crack head
Watch the video.  Clearly self defense.
Shame on you f#!#$#ers
Can you imagine if this guy was black or Spanish ?
Murderer.
Commie rag doxxing people. You may regret it.
The last one literally said I shouldn't have hesitated i should have dump my mag into him......
Murder your fellow Americans and it’s patriotic. Love it
A Right Wing Murderer Extremist out in public. His trial can't happen soon enough !
Wow I think this is called white privilege
This I disgusting. This was not self defense. He was going hunting.
when I think of pillows, i dont automatically envision cleopatras lounge section russian Instagram models or emilys applefarm,  nor do i instantly engage in relaxing on demi roses diplomacy flotilla, which conveniently circles the nature reserves outskirts.
The kid better enjoy freedom while he has the opportunity because it won't last much longer.
Hero
Wow the 17 year old who killed two is out. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
If it was clearly self defense then why do he have to bail out ? This is a very messed up system.
Gonna go out and buy a couple more My Pillows!! My wife loves hers.
Wowwwwwww
I was thinking of giving a few “My Pillows” for Christmas. Now I’ll definitely do so.
Good boy !❤️🇺🇸
And that is the law and order party helping a criminal get out of jail
Go kyle your a hero
That kid is a spoiled brat Odds are pretty good he is going to jump bail
Punk
I wonder if Today ever did a story on all the Antifa thugs and looters that got bailed out by left-leaning celebrities.
White supremacists win.
Media says "murder suspect"...try American hero.  He had the courage to stand up to criminals when he had to; we need more courage like this in our world.
Clams self defence. You can clearly see it was from multiple  videos.
Conservatives are terrorists not patriots
After reading these comments I can see why people are saying there is going to be a civil war some of yall just need to be purged on 🤷‍♂️
good for this young patriot
V
Murder suspect?? Let my man go
It's funny that a dude who killed two people and gets to post bail but a black dude who sells weed gets life in prison with no bail
He was acting in self defense. He was being chased by a mob.
Black rifle coffee is low key a racist white owned company.  Avoid them.
Fascists stick together that’s why little racist Rittenhouse got out. Gotta be nice to be a murderer and a white male with support of a fascist conservative government.
Media always has to add "Trump supporter" to any person that doesn't fit their narrative. You'll never hear media say "Biden supporter" ever. Watch.
The worst news ever
He was safer in juvie......JUST SAYING! 😶
How’s flipper doing?
The incident where Kyle was repeatedly attacked is on video.  He is not "claiming" he was acting in self defense, he was acting in self defense.  Typical NBC leftist anti Trump fake news activists calling themselves journalists.
Buying ten my pillows immediately
This kid is obviously a basement dweller looking for his moment to make a difference ( all in his own mind, of course) too bad he chose to do it with a gun, I'll bet he wouldn't have been murdered by the skateboarder he killed. That's common sense.
Ya free kyel he dose not belong in prison
Those are trumps people and they get out of jail after he murdered 2 humans and if another person did that and is not white or rich 🤔 well then straight to he u 😉 go !
How dare yall spit in our faces where is the justice he is murderer he pre meditated on this
Wow. Ok. It's official. Ricky Schroeder = racist. Good to know
#hero
He committed murder. Why is he out on bail?
Congratulations, Kyle! Your excellent defense team can get to work for a Great American!
He is murderer
What happened with Mr. Bye-Bye-Bicep?  He was a felon illegally carrying a gun.  Is he in jail now?  I hope so.  He ought to be.
Is what that says !!!!
It looked like pretty clear self defense to me.
Only in America
Good it was self defense.  Sick of Antifa and BLM violence without repercussions
Rittenhouse is a HERO     today is a mouthpiece for ccp
Kyle is going to walk, lol.
I wonder. What if Kyle was black,  how would this play out.
LOL mypillow founder, thats funny
About time. He should have never been arrested in the first place. Videos clearly show self-defense.
1.7  blm dumbasses
Two known abusers paying bail on someone who's so abusive they got carried away and started killin' folk.  Imagine that, birds and turds of a feather, clump together.
This is disgusting shame on all of you and it’s not self-defense cuz he's not even old enough to get a gun and why is he in a protest that's for BLM  ALL OF YOU ARE IDIOTS
The hero we needed
Murderer
He might.... MIGHT not be convicted of murder, but manslaughter, carrying a firearm as a minor in public,  discharging of the firearm in which endangers the public. Those will likely stick and he will do some jail time for sure. Oh and he will never be able to legally purchase, own or operate a firearm in the US.
Okay what? Now him getting bailed out like what.
Young man, you are my hero! ❤
The boi is guilty af. He killed the first person and thats why he was running away and being chased down. He will go to prison for life.
I suppose if this kid killed your son y’all wouldn’t be so self righteous. Hes a freaking murderer.
Kyle Rittenhouse, putting people to sleep. Brought you by, My Pillow.
The dumb kid had no business there especially with a deadly weapon. Right wingers probably think he's a patriot. Those familiar with Hitler's beer hall putsch may recall that many considered he acted out of patriotism. The kids needs some time to think about his actions. Two people are dead due to his thoughtless arrogance.
What happens when you are not taken out immediately and allowed to escape 👌🏽
i see all the pink and green haired screechers where quick to thumbs this video down haha
Mike Lindell is a Christian and not afraid to say so.  I am not only a fan of him but of his products.  God bless him and GOD Bless America.
Hes gonna get a private my pillow delivery in the middle of the night now.  I think he might deserves it
What was going on down there was all over the news.   Curfews were ordered, he knew what was about to happen.  His lack of knowledge would not buy at all.  I am over here in Michigan.
The video of the incidents clearly show the kid was defending himself. This charge is just politically motivated.
Good, he was defending himself and should have never been arrested.
Well, I used to be a fan, now Im not. FU, Schroeder.
The only thing this young man is guilty of is self defense,  the state of Wisconsin didn't even file charges against the convicted felon that WAS shot for illegal possession of a fire arm...WTF?
Its a riot...you defend yourself...you dont do there to commit murder.
Maybe I should parade around a gun in my streets and shoot people to make everyone safe! :D
This Administration has left me with a feeling of 'AMERICA - Closed for Renovation' if we make it to January 20th.
Was wondering yesterday how he posted a F**king 2million dollar bail
He will be biting a pillow in prison soon
He claims self defense plus the video evidence shows self defense. I'm calling it, self defense
Nice... seems Ricky Schroder not a commy like the rest of Hollywood!!!
Pretty obvious it was self defense...
I am so happy for the victim of the left.  I do not think it was the reason why but i will go buy some pillows right now.  Yea for the team.
they had to throw in "Trump supporter" didn't they?  MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS THE TRUE DIVIDER OF THIS COUNTRY!!!
He deserves to get off.
Self defense if you have a brain.
Kyle was acting in self defense. What was he supposed to do? Get beaten by a mob?
He was !
2 million dollars and he gets support to pay that? We are in a desperate need of professional help people!! Defending a criminal, defending a guy carrying military weapons on our streets in then take a picture with that trash person like he is a hero? We are in serious need of psychology help guys!
that murderer should be decaying in a cell right now and the people that bailed him out should get the chair
400 year's ago the Pilgrims came and turned this untamed beast known as America into the envy of the modern world.   THANK YOU PILGRIMS FOR YOUR VISION AND SACRIFICE!
Smile while you can Kyle.
Kid should get a medal!!!!!!
Kyle is a hero.  He defended himself and his community from armed communist insurgents.
Leftist defending freedom gets taken out by unmarked extrajudicial hit squad while terrorist who crossed state lines to bring a gun to a peaceful protest gets bailed out.
We should be judged by the people we hang around with.
There is nothing to smile about when someone has murdered another person in cold-blood. This is a picture-perfect example of the people that are dragging the country and civilization down. They are smiling at murder, death, and heartache.
Just a matter of time before the kid gets a show on Fox and sponsorships from gun manufacturers.
Idk what to think... I honestly believe that he shouldn’t of been out there to begin with.  But I also believe he had every right to shoot his attackers, especially being attacked with deadly weapons .
We are living within a failed society.
Ricky Schroder? Childhood destroyed :(
It was self defense, about as clear cut as you can get. Now, time to buy some pillows.
Self-defense only applies while you're in the act of being assaulted.  The first person was chasing Kyle, so there's a clear argument for self-defense.  Kyle shot his second victim (the one with the skateboard) while the victim was running away.  That's a clear argument for murder.  Kyle shot his third victim (the one with the pistol) while he was trying to disarm Kyle after he (Kyle) had already killed 2 people. No judge on this planet will see that as anything but either assault with a deadly weapon or attempted murder.
TWICE as many American citizens gives thumbs-up to this news.  Kyle Rittenhouse has the support of TWICE as many American citizens compared to not.  good.  Rittenhouse is a good young man.  The perps he had to shoot were attacking him.  Violence can get you killed.  Fighting in the streets for neo-Marxism is a fool's errand.
Now I can't get that silver spoons song out of my head 😫
The world has become too convoluted and the media is taking advantage of that.
Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong
Sad that he was arrested for defending his life. USA is CRAZY.
Wondering how many folks on this site are lawyers and or investigators?? Hold it...This is youtube, the place is flooded with lawyers and professional investigators. And I noticed some wannabe judges also. Interesting.  Well there folks, the court of public opinion is closed. Let this particular case go it's course. And keep your weak emotions in check already.
I heard  Chuck Norris does his  work outs in front of Kyle poster ...
An underage kid with a weapon he is not legally allowed to have crossed state lines to "protect" the store of someone he didn't know and had nothing to do with.  You cannot do that and claim self-defense.  He murdered two people while in the act of committing a crime, illegal possession of a weapon and crossing state lines to commit a crime which are all felonies.  Lock him up forever.
Glad the kids out
Before you crap on the kid, recognize you would do the same if you were about to be terminally stomped on by some ideologically possessed pawns.
This is a patently obvious case of self-defence.
Go see Colion Noir's video on the Kenosha Kid. He's looking at all videos presented to him from a legal perspective that will destroy peoples absurd narrative of him being a "domestic terrorist/nationalist going there to shoot innocent protestors".
The POS should rot in jail
Good that boy is a hero
sad to see two men died from a kid.. not even to carry a gun he's under age....
I didn't know Ricky Schroeder was part of the KKK. Sad I knew we had racist in are country but I didn't know it was half the country.
get this thing in court now and quit this pony show now!!!!!!
Welcome Home! Stay Safe! Enjoy the Freedom. Murica! #WeStandWithKyle
Trumpers sure love murderers, as long as they love Trump!
Do you believe Kyle Rittenhouse is guilty or innocent?  Vote for or against Kyle at KyleRittenhouse.com to shape public opinion on this landmark case.  Public opinion shapes everything from trials to laws.  Public opinion matters and Kyle is currently losing #TheKyleVote.
Wow.  Knew I hated my pillow
Kyle's lucky he isn't black #whiteprivilege
I can't wait till Kyle's lawyer sues Joe Biden for defamation.
Bad parenting.  Plain and simple.  The second amendment is one of the most important freedoms we have but with it comes grave responsibilities.  Allowing your teenage son to attend a powder keg protest with an assault rifle in his hands is not just irresponsible, it's sick.  I actually feel bad for Kyle in that he may pay a huge price for his parent's failure.  Idiots like them are going to get all of our guns taken away.
Killed in self defense, during riots in Kenosha. All 3 shot were felons, all 3 were trying to murder him, one was a rapest of children. Interesting the filth that BLM attracts.
Good news!
lol we gon get him boys. he is back with the public now. he gon get got
@todayshow sucks
anybody that saw the video can clearly see that it was self defense, he was being chased down by numerous grown as men that should of been ashamed of themselves, real brave seven or eight on one but that's how the left operates
No doubt bailed out by two shady losers likened to trump;  a has-been actor who was recently arrested for domestic violence and the pillow guy who continues to stuff his scam product with toxic chemicals and had to settle out of court
If any of you MSM harlots had seen the play by play video you would know that he acted in self defense.
NG
I've seen the videos, he's innocent. Self defense. Probably shouldn't have been put in that position, but still when someone attacks you, you have the right to self defense.
Great serve you did for this country is worth more than money I hope your trial goes well God bless you:🇺🇸 my pillow company sorry for the inconvenience words I spoken
I shall never use a pillow again
😑😑😑
A murdering 17 y/o wanna be cop getting released on bail...?    Nice job, America. 🙄
He was luring trouble with that rifle in hand walking around wrongfully claiming to be a medic, asking for horror.
Who knew Ricky was a trump cultist? I thought he was just a "Where Are They Now?" curiosity.
I will not by any pillow manufactured by this menace and make him bankrupt with accountant turned senator corrupt Ron Johnson
About to buy hella mypillows. What a patriot!
He shouldn't have been put in jail in the first place.  You have the right to defend yourself.
Yes, looks like a person with no remorse in his heart who Killed two unarmed men and wounded an armed medic. 🤨😐😑🤨
Glad he is out.
Oh great, if the kid wasn’t white nationalist before, he will be now.
Good for him!! He needs to be freed from all charges!! The kids a hero!!
Rittenhouse did exactly what everyone in this country should do... Protect their community from those who want to destroy it.
That leftist DA that charged him with murder >When it's all on video and clearly self defense< didn't charge the guy Kyle shot in the arm as he was raising a pistol to shoot Kyle in the head and who admitted later he was going to murder Kyle. This isn't seeking justice, this is defending their leftist ideology, just like the leftist DA in St Louis that charged the couple for defending their home from trespassing rioters, who were threatening to kill them and burn down their home.
He needs to file for defamation after this is all said and done.
Thank god he’s free until proven not guilty in court. Today is a good day.
Bailed out by two shady losers likened to trump;  a has-been actor who was recently arrested for domestic violence and the pillow guy who continues to stuff his scam product with toxic chemicals and had to settle out of court
Only delaying the inevitable. Justice will prevail as this racist punk will be behind bars where he belongs.
Free kyle
Never should have been there to begin with. Clearly self defense regardless of what you lefties think
Doesnt mater Kylie  is a dead man walking now
I want to give a Testimony on how I got Cured From Herpes . 7 Months ago I was Diagnosed of Herpes . I was having some outbreaks. I went to see a Doctor and many Blood Tests was done on me. My Doctor told me that there’s no cure for Herpes Virus I felt bad, I went online searching for a possible cure for Herpes Virus, I saw a post of IHIBOR A herbal doctor that cured someone from Herpes. I contacted him and told him how I’m feeling he said his herbal medicine can cure me. He sent me the medicine via Courier Service and I received the medicine some days after he sent it, i took the medicine as prescribed by him. Before the completion of the medication the symptoms stopped. I went to the Doctor and carried out another blood test, surprisingly I was Negative. I haven’t had any symptoms anymore, you can contact him Email address:_________________________________ (drihiborherbalhome@gmail.com) via WhatsApp +2349050141449
Good for him.  I don't think he is guilty. self defence clearly!
see there are good ppl.     GOD BLESS
Yay Kyle!
I'm not surprised. Trump will probably pardon him.
WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what a great christian! LOL
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow little Ricky Schroeder, a BLADENT RACIST, who would have thought.... We already knew about the My Pillow Guy. SMH... That's so awesome that they WA$TED two million dollar$ on a bottom feeding, 🍕💩‼️ HAHAA!🤑🤣 #guiltyashell
Good for him for defending himself.
Kyle "pilin' em up" Rittenhouse is as significant as Paul Revere... instead of the British are coming, it's the Communists are here..
There's goes the mypillow stock. 🗑️
Murder pillows.
Clear self defense. Gj Kyle!
Very Few teens today have the guts and glory as those who stormed the beaches of Normandy and Omaha. Kyle does. 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 Salute to Kyles Mom and Dad!!
For anyone claiming he did what he did out of self defense, he left his home, went 20 miles to a city and state he doesn't live in, with a rifle he illegally bought, to defend property that isn't his. If he didn't want to be in prison, he should have stayed home, and you're all demented psychopaths for worshipping him
Fake news —citizen journalism is the future —Here is the truth — AP dodo birds without a shred of journalistic integrity.   Kyle acted in Self- defense — what a hack clip showing who you want activists to target — precisely why we have such divisive hateful atmosphere —rioters waged war on the city of Kenosha and it was being burned to the ground.  Democratic  Governor Tony Evers refused to send adequate numbers of National Guard.   Kyle knew more about law and order than all domestic terrorists attacking Kenosha combined —he and many other armed civilians reinforcements had full knowledge and support of local law enforcement in ground who were completely overwhelmed in numbers.   On day 2 The city of Kenosha requested 750 NG and Gov Evers (D) sent 150 maybe if even of the amount requested because he doesn’t even know how to defend his own Capitol city from acts domestic terrorism.   He is weak.   The next day Kenosha City council requested 1250 and Evers sent an additional 100 to being total number to 250.   And after the civilians had to arm themselves instead we blame Kyle for defending himself after he arrived to help law enforcement protect city when our Governor is ultimately to blame for lack of leadership.   All evidence clearly demonstrated that Kyle is shown being chased by a domestic terrorist who threw a moletov cocktail at him which is an improvised explosive device.   Kyle wasn’t the only one who shot at the same individual who threatened his life and personal safety and the safety of the public.   Furthermore in the second case, Kyle was hit over the head on the ground with a skateboard and then another armed domestic terrorist accosted him with a weapon drawn (hand gun) while Kyle was still prone on the ground with mob was in pursuit all around.   Kyle is more of an American hero than half people in this country — I’d love to see some more people, men in particular as well trained and courageous who don’t wait for permission to defend their cities.   The American people should not have to stand idly by while criminals run rip shod over this country and pretend it’s about saving lives and solving racism —It’s not about racism—it was about it harnessing trauma to elect an old criminal himself —Joe Biden who wrote 1994 crime bill that is why PoC suffering decades of poverty and families torn apart —and installing a criminal prosecutor who took pride in locking up PoC as a career trophy🏆 ...   Plain as day— this year was about harnessing trauma to pull off scam election rigging and Democrats haven’t given a crap for law and order but they love power ....  But at the end of the day —criminals get what they deserve. Choose wisely this day whom you will serve.
Beware the heroes you keep...
Ironically, that is the same pillow used by Epstein to smother himself in his jail cell.
I would never would buy a Mike Lindell product. He uses no people of color in his ads..  He uses dogs, but no people of color...
He shouldn't need bail. He is innocent.  He put out a fire and was chased for it by a crowd who had weapons, and later pulled a hand gun on him.
This is wonderful news!
smh - there's going to be a lot of "defensive killings" on Jan. 20, 2021... the fall of US Democracy...
Plot twist; He kills MyPillow founder with his own pillow...😂
What a wonderful young man Kyle Rittenhouse is, he killed terrorists and should be commended for that.
Self defense.  Looters got what they were asking for
There will never be a RepubliKKKan president ever again, and we will clean up the damage RepubliKKKans have caused over the past few decades. Right-wing terror*sts need to be execut*d or at the very least sent to forced-labor camps.
Kyle and my pillow putting em to sleep
All we have to do is stand still and smile. The left will grab the barrel of a gun. This is the last thing that hasent been bubble wrapped for them. Natural evolution stopped for a while. Now it can start again because they are coming out of the bubble wrapped areas into areas they don't understand and would expect to be in the right until they find out our laws are not from your bubble wrapped city. Its too perfect.
America Must Be Destroyed
Good for Rittenhouse. The media has not been honest about what happened on that night. May the full blessings of God be upon Kyle Rittenhouse and his legal team / support network.
It was more than just a claim....it actually was self defense! There was absolutely no cause to try and disarm him to begin with....other than the fact that he put out a dumpster fire and the mob didn't like that. He was being chased from others that were pointing guns at him....he fell and they were screaming get him....he had someone point a gun at him point blank range...he shot him as his life was in imminent danger. I'd shot too!
Next can they pay Amy Cooper's legal costs and help her get her job back?
I guess the pillows double as kkk hoods.
God bless you kyle
it was self defense the man was getting shot at and shot back. He tried everything before resorting to lethal force even ran away and when he did shoot he tried shooting in less lethal ways.
I’m glad he’s out! He innocent. I donated $500 to his defense team. Godbless Kyle!
Kyle an american hero
The fate of an underage paramilitary Boogaloo fascist actively seeking trouble and convicted of intentional killing divides America.
Kyle defended himself against grown men(with extensive criminal records mostly of the sexual kind[go look it up]) who were attacking him.
BOOM BABY!
NO JURY IN THE WORLD WILL CONVICT THIS KID.  HE ONLY SHOT THOSE WHO ATTACKED HIM.  CLEAR CASE OF SELF DEFENSE.
He'll get off scot-free; videos clearly shows his life in danger. There is no god and therefore god has nothing to do with it.
I have a sudden desire to buy a pillow....
Wtf
If Kyle Rittenhouse had a black man as an accomplice he would have been charged third degree murder life sentence and nobody would have bail him out. PS those two million dollars could have been used to house the homeless.
All three people he shot had violent criminal records. One was a child molester. He he wasn’t armed he would have been killed and the nobody would have cared. Kyle Rittenhouse is an American hero
Praise for murder. Shameful.
Just ordered 4 My Pillows.
This dude get bond for murder and i have been denied bond over minor misdemeanors wtf is wrong with with the justice system
That’s certainly one way to draw out some opinions
Way to go silver spoon!!💯💯💯
God wins! Prayers answered and American PATRIOTS come to the cause! Praise GOD! Happy Thanksgiving Kyle!
i was literally shopping for a pillow yesterday but then I remembered the crazy interview the my pillow guy did with Anderson cooper  a decided not to buy a "my pillow"
Kyle is a great American hero . He deserves a Purple Heart 💜.
America always glorifies killers
Great american hero
Just disheartening and disgusting.  Boycott all those that support 1st degree murder sanctioned by Trump.
Somebody needs to take that pussyboy out!
Good to see him out
How did he get a bail while facing 1st degree murder? 😲
patriot
Next post bail for the guys who sent the “jogger” home .
The kid had a gun illegally in a state he didn't live in.  He went looking for trouble and found it in a fight that wasn't his.  Now he can spend the rest of his life paying for his own mistakes and making new friends with African-American and Aryan Brotherhood inmates.  A little cherry like Rittenhouse should be very popular.
HERO
Welcome to the good ole America .  Be white extreme loyalist under crooked trump administration and you’re automatically exempt from justice for your capitol crimes...next stop trump pardon
I'm very moderate politically, but it's just a bad thing for everyone. You got two different groups brainwashed by the media. Dude was definitely trying to be a hero, which he shouldn't have, and it lead to these "protestors" (let's be real, these weren't protesters, these were people looking for trouble) chasing him. Unfortunately it lead to two people dying and a teen that's going to have to live with that forever.
Imagine standing up for a convicted pedophile😂. Anyone who takes advantage of children in the worst kind of way deserve to die.
I may need to install M60 for my self defense from them.
HAHAHHA
In other news : the false title "President Elect" has been removed from Joe Biden's Facebook page and is now accurately titled as "politician"  You're welcome! Have a nice day!
I love my pillow^^ and if you try to attack me for it I will go Jacob Blake on you as well^^
What a disgrace! This young man killed 2 people needlessly and should be held without bail!
Self defense is self preservation....Good call. 💪👁️
Kyle Rittenhouse did absolutely nothing wrong, I sure hope some racist far-left scum-bag DA doesn't railroad him and ruin his life like they did to that poor boy from Charlottesville.
It's funny if this kid had done this, being either black or hispanic, he would be on death row right now in Texas or Florida. But of course you have to consider the good people, plus Ricky Schroder? What would Alfonso Ribeiro Say?
B A S E D.
Hope he gets the book thrown at him and made an example of. People who defend him are not very intelligent.
I wonder how much in taxes he will be required to pay for that income.
He was clearly acting in self-defense
What Losers! How can anyone justify 2 Murders?
Kyle gain weights in Jail.
Run the race Patriots, keep your eyes on the mark of the high calling in Christ. Prayer with praise and Thanksgiving is still needed. Do not lose heart. Continue to give God what he needs to hear. Continue you on Mr President give us back America.
SMFH
Cuz he was duh
Cool I'm buying a my pillow right now! Thanks for the advertisement!
Protesters were chasing him and he got scared so he shot you're obviously going to get scared if protesters are chasing you and if you have a gun you are going to act. However, I think it is dumb to take a AR 15 to a protest.
I'm going to save my community by driving an hour into a different state and using an illegally gotten firearm to go and protect people he has no need to be there for. He made a volatile situation much worse and ended the lives of two Americans and hurt others in his very misplaced sense of "protecting" the public.
Good for him; NOT ONLY is Kyle innocent, he is a true patriot. Isn't it amazing that all three people he shot we're degenerates (Wife beaters, Kid Diddlers)? The same folks aggressively destroying a city and demanding to abolish police, while police were ordered to stand down?  A shining example of why our forefathers enacted the 2nd Amendment.
He was nearly killed by the mob .
NOT I REPEAT NOT NO WAY  GUILTY PUT ME ON THE JURY NOT GUILTY NOPE INNOCENT SET HIM FREE GIVE HIM A MEDAL NOT GUILTY SHOOTING BLM ANTIFA OR DEMODUMMIES IS NOT A CRIME  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!    NOT GUILTY
Free Kyle!
White privileged at its best  , a very sad day  where the kkk gets away with ....
Pillow guy should be smothered with his own pillow and Schroder should go back to making content that nobody watches. Cold blooded killers are not to be celebrated you sick f#cks
The US is full of idiots
I am incapable of understanding how these people are actually Christians. Satan is dancing over this.
*Kyle Rittenhouse Posts Bail With Help From Bite The Pillow Founder Michael Lindell | TODAY*
I will never buy my pillow.
What is this world coming to just sad
What a disappointment!
Kyle is a national hero 🇺🇸
Justice is truly different for Whites and colored while on paper were all "Americans". Hes no patriot. Hes guilty and so are the police for letting him leave  after shooting three people and killing one.
“First degree homicide”? Is that fancy for murder or are they trying to slowly disconnect him from the whole murder thing?
Well, there go my pillows in the trash! The kid definitely needs deprogramed. Intent is critical here. Trump does this. Incites..
the second guy didnt have to get shot he was running away
White folks, afraid of everything; that fear you cling on to, will destroy you from within...
Claim ? It was self defense ....
That young man is a Hero, not a criminal, he was protecting that neighborhood, and when there was an attempt to bodily injury him he has the right to defend himself, from a mob of hoodlums.
As a left-leaning, transexual man of color who has risen to the heights of the BLM ranks, I whisper "MAGA"
He was acting as David did, when he slayed Goliath. For surely, he would have died had he not!
Sick people supporting this murderer.
i hope the my pillow factory unionizes
So the Crack heads got him out
This story is amusing and serves as a microcosm of the divide in this country. Those who are petulant, emotional little children with a severe disconnect from reality struggle to invent reasons why kyle should be convicted while rational, level headed people who are the leaders and go-getters in this country take the time to actually analyze the evidence, get the facts of the story accurate and are able to discern that its a blatant case of self defense.
*Notice how all the trash, morons and racists all gravitate to the right?*
Wooooooow I want bail for murdering people
Good! It was, and will be proven to be self-defense. 💯👍🏽
What a good lack of purchase I made
Dam shame
i'M GLAD THEY WASTED ALL THAT MONEY ON HIM AND THERE NOT GETTING IT BACK
Claims he acted in self defense? Did you not want to show the video where Kyle shoots the gun out of one of his attackers hand??
God bless Michael self-defense on film this kid is scared for life because of these animals ops ( peaceful protesters)
Defended his LIFE self defense you attack expect to be put down there lucky he wasn't a combat vet because none of the targets would have survived....
We need more men like Kyle and less men in dresses.
My Cry Pillow, it's the new conservative gotta have on your list this year item.
"He claims he was acting in self defense?"  No, there is video evidence that he was acting in self defense.
PUT THAT THUG BACK IN JAIL
I'll buy a bunch of those pillows today
The fact he spent even one day in jail is a travesty. The video proves his innocence 100%. I'm so proud of this young man and the way he stood up to those criminals.
Hey guys, after I pull off this crime, y'all will post my bail too, right? I'm white and I promise to say Trump was cheated out of the election if you help me here. Heck, I'll even register as a Republican if that helps.
CLAIMS??? NO... HE WAS ACTING IN SELF DEFENSE.    I wouldnt want to get tickled by that Cho-Mo either
Heros come in all ages... welcome home
That is sick🤮🤮🤮🤮
*AGAIN ANYONE USING SELF DEFENSE BULLSHlT LINE IS WRONG. A PERSON WHO DOES SELF DEFENSE DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO PUT ON GLOVES PRIOR TO SHOOTING ANOTHER . THIS IS CLEAR MURDER KYLE DID AND HE WENT THERE TO DO. IF ANYTHING, GUYS THAT CHASED KYLE WAS DEFENDING THEMSELVES FROM KYLES ACTIONS* .
Kyle 100% acted in self defense. How did he not? He was attacked. No one should attack another person, especially if the other person is carrying an AR-15. The people who died are pretty stupid to be honest for going after a clearly armed man.
God wins- Trump wins- We the people will win! *iiiiMAGAiiii2020iiii*
That's a headline I never thought I would read.
Finally something positive in the news👏👏👏
Going to trash those pillows.... I could never get a good night’s sleep ever again knowing how he spends his money....money I wish I had never spent.
#FreeKyle
Next time you see My Pillow and Trump Supporter Michael Lindell look for the cross he likes to display outside his shirt.  It's like putting perfume or lipstick on the pig. Turns out he is still a pig.
Kyle is a righteous kid, He never deserved to be in jail, This kid is amazing and a model citizen,  I wish I could adopt him myself! I am really proud of Kyle!
So the MyPillow guy who claims to be a devout Christian, posts bail for somebody that killed another human being, who they haven't been able to prove he's not guilty yet which is why he was still locked up.
He was acting in self-defense.
Looks like I need a new pillow and I know the guy I'm buying it from!
Good!!!!
Yet another reason to just stay home and play video games in stead of going anywhere!
American hero!!!!! Hang in there Kyle!
Is NBC Universal trying to hurt My Pillow sales? If you think so, Thumb down this video and Boycott NBC
Pillow biter
Nice! He's obviously a good guy. I love the video where he blasts the people trying to take his gun.
110% self-defense, a true American hero.
There's no political motivation involved in this bail postin.....noooo. 🙄
Just a suggestion, but uh, maybe people arrested for murder shouldn't get bail?
This country will have another civil war.
Good! He did nothing wrong but fight back!
I hate this world...it's so heartbreaking
He made a deal with a pillow guy and a Hoolyweird child actor he's in for a kicker.
MSM white washing murders again....wonder if they run this segment if the shooter was black?
He needs to go to prison.
George Soros should be in jail for financing these riots.
I had no idea having someone buy you a gun, driving across state lines and then killing people was considered self defense.
Good deal. He deserved to get out, he did nothing wrong except defend himself.
i imagine he would have been guest speaker at trump's inauguration, you know, if trump hadn't lost like a big fat loser.
Dang I thought this kid got off. Honestly, he deserves jail. He had no business being there that night.
Hmm, looks like the pillow guy has some sense! I’m sure he is banking on 70 million Trump supporter to run out and buy some pillow 🏃🏃🏃
Hope the kid gets what he deserves!
Not a word about Dominion being in 26 states corrupting elections... All those blue state 'clear victories' must now be investigated for algorithm fraud and ballot stuffing! You losers still are not listening!
I almost purchased a my pillow, a lady in the store told me she purchased a couple of them, but was not satisfied with them.  Glad I didn't get them.
Can’t let domestic terrorists take over, its important to stand up for your rites. If not BLM will destroy our country.
I always knew Ricky S. hated on Alfonso Ribeiro for being cooler and his skin tone.  Even Punky Brewster was > Ricky. Punky was more hip to what was goin on in the streets. They needed Alfonso to help Ricky understand, but he still doesn’t get it.
Can't wait until he's found not guilty on all charges and you punk leftists have to have another Twitter screamfest. 🤣😆🤣
How low can these people go? Right is wrong and wrong is right. It's almost like they don't realize that God can see everything. Including what's in their hearts. But they will. They will...
Kyle should be in prison! He crossed state lines with a gun looking for trouble, and he found it! That shows INTENT!
This kid should never had come out on bail I had two attempt murders in New York and I didn't get a bail hearing until 18 months and I was remanded for the whole duration My first bail was $250,000 after laying up for 18 months this ain't right the only reason why he got it is cuz he's white this is what America has came to and then you guys wonder why we act the way we act
Bottom line is he should’ve stayed home. Yes he defended himself but at the end of the day he was wrong to travel across state lines with a weapon at an age he can’t even have a weapon for something that had nothing to do with him.
He shouldn't have been locked up in the first place. Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong.
Maybe they'll give him a pillow to bite once they send him to real prison, he's young and got a pretty mouth so he'll be popular! The champ however would not be impressed.
Also it's not self defense when your motive is to get in a car and bring your gun over state lines and planing to shot people. The kid needs serious mental help is he going to get it no. And by the way I feel bad for the kid because in death he will need to face the two people he killed and there no orient father, or pope that can forgive his sins for what he did. Just a thought...
So glad that Kyle was able to walk out of jail today.  He would have never gotten that opportunity if not for the 2nd amendment.
you can see the ignorance in the kids eyes...the kid never should have been allowed to carry an assualt rifle....he's too stupid
DISGUSTING.(edited for the slow kids in the chat) * Pathetic Excuses for Human beings.  Please go crawl back into the spider holes you have been hiding in, The CITIZENS OF THIS WORLD NO LONGER WANTS TO BE HELD BACK BY VILLAINS WHO  CLING ONTO ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLES THE RISE OF A 3RD RIECHT..  SAD, SAD, LOSERS!!!
Mike Lindell (Pillow Guy), was once a crack addict, has had more than a dozen lawsuits filed against him, two of which he had to pay over $1 million in penalties, plus $100,000 towards charitable donations. Not even 6 months after he claimed Trump's tax cuts helped him with his business, Lindell laid off 150 employees. He also laid off 140 more employees from another plant. He also has filed for bankruptcy, yet he finds the money to help bail out Kyle? His bail was set at $2 million. Shroder also has an extensive past. He was arrested for a DUI after demolishing his car in Malibu. He was arrested for punching a girlfriend in her face, and arrested twice more (in less than 30 days), for domestic violence with yet another girlfriend last year.
So glad he is out hope he wins his case
Black Rifle Coffee supports the NRA which has been advocating against the second amendment for decades...might wanna change your shirt, kid.
Go to Anthony Patch and YouTube for the breakdown of the Covid Vaccine which also will change your DNA...
Disgusting 🤬🤦🏾‍♀️
I can only imagine what Earth would look like if Kyle had access to the nuclear launch codes.
I almost bought a "my pillow" the other day too. WOOOO! Dodged a bullet there.
THIS TEEN WAS DOING A MANS JOB,PROTECTING PROPERTY THAT NO ONE HAD THE RIGHT TO DESTROY.AND GROWN MEN ATTACKING A TEENAGER IS DISGUSTING.BUT DONT WORRY ALL OF YOU OUT THERE WISHING EVIL ON HIM,ARE GOING TO REAP WHAT YOU SOW
Disgusting.
Kyle's gonna be a black guys pillow in jail!
The morning the teen that defended himself and saved his own life posts bail
Time to buy some my pillows
Yay
He shot 2 pedophiles. Self Defense. I've watched over 50 mins of footage, listened to several interviews from ppl on the ground, listened to lawyers and watched video break downs. You won't convince me it wasn't self defense. Only a shoddy lawyer or a stacked court could get him convicted.
The kid went across state lines with an assault rifle and killed 2 people.  And you people who want to call your selves, "Christians" cheer.    Just like the ones who cheered when they crucified  Christ I suppose.
He shouldnt have been in jail to begin with
Trump supporters/republicans bailed out a white man that KILLED multiple ppl at a Black Lives Matter protest. 🤔 I wish I was shocked.....That “party” will NEVER have my support again.
Give that kid a medal !!  Kyle is a Patriot !!  He shot scum criminals while protecting sanity
This is one crossover that I did not expect to see
I love split-screen America, it’s like a brand new, mind-bending psychedelic drug that brings you to an alternate reality where there is actually two realities existing simultaneously.
💜🇺🇸👍
This is disgusting and a failure of justice. He. Is. A. Murderer. He purchased a firearm ILLEGALLY. He crossed state lines with that firearm, by his OWN CHOICE, ILLEGALLY. He put himself in a volatile situation in which he had no business being in BY HIS OWN CHOICE with INTENTION TO DO HARM. And HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE.  Kyle is NOT THE VICTIM HERE. The TWO PEOPLE HE MURDERED ARE.
Self defense is our right. Take it away and criminals win.
The government better use that 2 million dollars on something good.
ladies and gentlemen, your next millionaire under 18.
Good it was self defense
That my pillow guy has gone soft in the head.
This is a good thing. the media playing this like he was a bad guy ..
Reading some of these comments, it’s sad how some people have to live with so much hate in their heart for others who don’t look like them.
All you loony libs crying 😭🤣
Where is Hunter????!!!??
JOE BIDEN RAN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BUT WILL END UP IN THE BIG HOUSE!!!!
All Republicans are pedophiles.
Based Pillow salesman
Rittenhouse is a national hero.
Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong.
He should have been released the day he was arrested and then given an award not a case number .... Sure is funny how all the satanic Hollywood deepstate elites post bail for the rioters who destroy the city but they hold a hero in jail and wont help him KYLE YOU ARE A TRUE HERO BROTHER AND I KNOW GOD IS WITH YOU ....
AWesome!
At least his butt will get a little break.
This is the most disgusting piece of news I’ve heard in a while
God Wins The Great Awakening
Good! He should be free.
Good young man
Kyle Rittenhouse represents the good in all of us!!! 2a all day
#boycott my pillow guy.
Ahahahah
Amazing how the sheep do not know facts.  Continually brainwashed by the media.
THANK YOU MY PILLOW !!!!!!!!!
George Soros babies don’t want to prosecute BLM, Antifa and all the demonkkkrat terrorist groups, but they are punishing good people.
So this is what we’ve become, equal justice for Antifa, BLM and ALL....END CASH BAIL NOW.
Great. Now drop these false charges and give them their bail money back.
What a hero!
It’s funny how people complain about Biden’s tax plan that won’t affect them at all, but are willing to give their income to support a felon and a fake wall 🤣
Gods work. I love my family. This is Patriotism.
America Hero!
My pillow stock has skyrocketed  !  If a felon was chasing me with a handgun,  I would have done the same.
Self defense against racist blm thugs is not a crime !
Don't buy anything any more fro my pillow guy. Bye bye my pillow guy
Love it!
Acting in self defense when he was the one carrying an assault rifle? Puhlease! Put him away for life. No mercy! He better hope I'm not on the jury for his case.
How to tell if someone you know needs chemically neutered-  Do they attend or plan to attend any protests?  Yes--> Neuter. No--> No.
If you've seen the video you know its self defense and the DA and Judge are incompetent political hacks.
Uhhh Ohhh......you said "Ricky"......it's "Rick".
it would be hilarious if he skipped bail and those stooges lost all their money
People should be killing more communists and child molesters
I wonder if those 3 special citizens can take “my pillow” to prison with them?
Happy Kyle is out of the cage!
All publicity is good publicity. Companies have been leeching off Trump supporters for 4 years and here is another example of these leeches getting their name recognized on television.
Enjoy Thanksgiving at home, Kenosha kid.
I getting some of his  pillows .
THE RIGHT OF SELF DEFENSE! THANK G-D, AMERICA IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY! SELF DEFENSE, SELF DEFENSE! BRAVO!
Oh but it was great when Hollyweird was bailing out Antifa members. I stand with this young man,and kudos for the one's that bailed him out!!!!
Waste of 2 mill smh
Is this the guy that got attacked and he shot someone's arm off during the protests , when they were supposedly trying to take his rifle ?
Disgraceful he needs to do his time
It was self defense leave the kid alone and let him go on with his life
Such an inspiration! (For conservative terrorists!)
Lock this moron up.
Great NEWS!! The second guy he shot pulled a handgun about 2 ft from him. Watch the videos on youtube, the gun is plain as day for all to see. Kyle actually showed great finger discipline considering he was about to be killed. I will have to buy some My Pillows to show support!!
He'll share a my pillow with Trump in the same cell.
Well thanks to that twit who paid his bail, this child has learnt absolutely nothing except that when you do something really stupid and racist, there is always a bigger fool to bail you out.
Good News. He shouldn't be in jail. Self defense is not a crime
When will Commander Rittenhouse and Salt Team 6 raid the CCP Don Lemon studios?
He may be guilty of a crime but Self defense is not a crime.
Kalief Browder was held at the Rikers Island jail complex, without trial, for allegedly stealing a backpack.. 2 of the 3 yrs in solitary confinement. fk your my pillows.
The courts would have a never let a murderer go free if they feel he was dangerous. Think about it.
Well I guess I know what pillow I'll never buy! And well, just forget "Ricky" Schorder.
Great news!
More trump conspiracy freaks , Kyle is alittle POS and that crackhead pillow freak is too
showed up to a protest from another city with a gun and killed 2 people and badly injuring another while fleeing the scene and now out on bail? And people call it self defense?  wow talk about white privileged smh
He's like so many serial killers of the past.  Constantly flirting with the desire to be an American hero police officer but he probably won't pass the psychological test when the time comes, or perhaps he will as police departments are scraping the bottom for good candidates these days.  If they do what's right and don't hire him he will eventually start his killing spree and then constantly try to insert himself into each and every investigation.  The suspect will be right under those ace detective's noses all along.    Maybe I should just write a book?  Oh wait, Ann Rule already wrote it.......
My pillow guy has to go full conservative.. because loony liberals boycotted his company that he had the audacity to give a speech about trump that said the economy was doing well and that did not call for trumps hanging.
Love you Kyle,
Black rifle coffee.  Best brew on the planet
It was self-defense all day long man
That's why it's good to have Rich friends
He deserves jail time. You don't get to take a life (in his case 2) and get away without consequences
AWWW, ain't he cute. The little race police mascot's parents should also be arrested for public endangerment because like the law-abiding white citizens they are they believe in posses-that their precious tenderoni was fully capable of being judge, jury and executioner in a situation where he didn't know where he was at, who was involved or how to handle an automatic weapon. The only thing heroic about this murderous little trick was the comic books he was reading. They might as well had released a chimp on the street on meth with a machine gun.
My Pillow I NEVER BUY FROM!!
Kyle, your an American hero. Too bad there are not more patriots like you. Most wear their AR15 like it’s a fashion statement without balls enough to use it.
A true patriot 🇺🇸
Look at it as a different role!!  The two men that approach Kyle access his Assault Rifle and remove it from his arms.   Nobody else was injured but that one killed. Now the two gentlemen would be considered heroes and Kyle would have been upset because they took his weapon but no harm would have been done other than him getting arrested for the first killing
Punk should never have been there. His mom helped facilitate his murders. Lock them both up.
Get it right he was not acting in self-defense he was in self-defense
Good.
This makes no sense.  He had no business being there in the first place.  Im all for freedom and i love guns but this kid is a killer.  What exactly was he defending? Someone else's stuff in another state.  He traveled there with a gun. If you travel to a hostile place with a gun, your intentions are pretty clear. Shoot someone.  That's ok though. No matter what anyone in here thinks, he is headed to prison which is where he belongs.
Psychos helping psychos
Kool he is NOT GUILTY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@TODAY I understand there's only so much news that you can cover, but SERIOUSLY why cover this story??  All you are going to do is give this PUNK additional coverage in which he doesn't deserve...if roles were reversed, I would bet he would be the one curled in a fetal position crying for his mommy, soaked in his own urine.  What a disgrace to the human race as well as Americans
Can we feed Biden some Rittenhouse? F Sleepy Joe.
FREE KYLE
Acting is self defense when attacked by neo liberal zombie mob for exercising your god given right and protected by the constitution should not land you in jail, period.
Dam shame
Lil ricky used to live in my town he'd show up with his wife and kids no shoes looking like none of them showered for months and demand stores shut down just for him and he'd throw a tantrum anytime he didn't get his way the town finally got tired of his entitled attitude and sent him and his family packing back to wherever that fake NY hillbilly came from
Terrible pillows.
Good.
Lol so they wasted 2 million.
He should have never been charged with murder in the first place.
He murdered two people and republicans want to help him? Disgusting.
Self Defense through and through, you don't chase someone down when they're running away and try to attack them.  Kyle did nothing wrong, the only people who think he was in the wrong just support rioters and vandalizers.
Animal, he went looking for trouble
That's the same Kyle that we have grown to know and love? Not so sure that's him. Always suspected it was another U.S. intel hoax anyway.
Shows true Genius when you claim "self-defense" after intentionally driving over state lines to "defend" Now the interesting part is if he were to have stayed home he wouldn't need bail AND there would be two people alive.
So this is what we’ve become, a cold blooded murderer is set free by the senseless rants of pillow talk. To coin the words of another Joker; “This system needs an enema!” Is it January 20th yet? Time for a much-needed regime change…
Sad  story  all the way around. Young lives  destroyed because of  mobs  out of  control in our  cities.  Our  vice president  elect Harris , raised  funds  for the  rioters, looters , city burners to  free them from jail  but  nothing   for this young  man.
He will be acquitted
it was self defense.  I would have done the same thing if someone coming after me with a weapon
That is sad! a Killer gets bail, F****d up!
Great day free Kyle
So one American hero help out a teen American hero, thats all!
Underage minor who crossed state lines. Illegal possession of weapon
They got duped.....
Under the Second amendment, you buy a gun, you've just joined the National Guard. Report at once to your local unit where every six months the medical officer can test you to see if you're sane enough to have a deadly weapon. Either that or recognize when the Second Amendment talks about "arms" they meant muzzle loading, single shot weapons. You can have as many of those as you want. Evertyhing else can be regulated or even  banned. No one needs an AK-47 for hunting or home defense. If you can't take out a burglar with a six shot revolver, you certainly don't need a machine gun. Who knows who else  might end up dead like next door if your aim is that bad.
The mob didn't appreciate him protecting innocent store owners and citizens.. So he had to protect himself. Kyle did nothing wrong.
Disgusting.
It was murder with an illegal gun across states line. You are toast!!!!!!
If trump is re-elected he will pardon this dude for sure
If the cities did their jobs in the first place their wouldn't be no "Peaceful Riots"
Still going to prison.
He was attacked, most likely BECAUSE he was carrying an AR, nobody reacts well to the presence of someone visibly carrying a gun in their hands.
The liberal media is who sparked those riots.  The people of liberal media should be ones in prison for getting citizens angry with fake news
A literal child. See how he’s life is turning.  Children stay at home and stay out of trouble.
Wow
Hero!
If you support Kyle Rittenhouse you are evil and you will join him when he burns for eternity in the lake of fire.
Disgusting
In a related story, rosenbaum's girlfriend was elated after surviving another night not having to get beaten to a pulp
Way to go Kyle. I'm going to go out and buy some more My Pillows in support.
the gang of pillow felt compelled to put up the bail due to their own guilt. they support an incendiary and hate mongering presidency that influenced this young mans mind to turn to violence. the pillow gang were rittenhouse accomplices, helping fuel the flames of hate and death. I wonder if the pillow gang is supporting the families of rittenhouse's victims. I think not. and by the way, I don't even use a pillow and I get a goods night"s rest. I'm sure they don't.
This kid has a good heart and went there to help protect a business and to render aid to ANYONE that needed it. He put out a fire intended to ignight a GAS STATION and was attacked. Self defense does not end when you leave your house!
And this is America under trump.  Disgusting pigs.
He’s a criminal and so is his neglectful parent. He shouldn’t have had guns to begin with and he will always be known as a white supremacy murderer
His enablers are going to be responsible for this kid's next killing spree. In his mind, he has been vindicated and rewarded for killing so his next spree will involve more innocent people.
It was self defense
I mean, maybe let’s at least not take a “thumbs up, dumb smile” photo, in light of the situation, eh guys?
Opened season on what we labeled leftists and activists.money can’t buy u love but it will buy you freedom.
Please let's excuse and even encourage kids to ruin their lives by becoming vigilantes.
The next time he's upset about the world, where is he gonna go with his gun..keep   bailing this kind of nut jobs, it might just be in your backyard where he shoots next.
Hey Kyle Glad your Out! Good Job!
Good because that kid was being chased down by the rioters not the other way around. It was a war zone i seen the footage.
if he would be black he would rott in jail to the end of his life
He's there's now
God bless them getting him out on bail for defending himself. He will be exonerated when this is all over.
Rittenhouse did nothing wrong! He shot in self defense!
There should not have been bail for this irresponsible kid. He wont learn anything from any of this except that the actions of him and the people around him, that led up to that night are ok in this country. Wake up America, it's like everyone has no common sense in the year 2020. I pray to the almighty higher power of this universe that we all find it again in 2021.
He claims he was acting in self defense
POS shouldn't have been out to begin with, that's not self defense. Self defense is using your fists not an ASSAULT RIFLE!
He was!
Antithesis of Law & Order
Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong.
Awesome!
So he buys a gun illegally transports it illegally across state line in possession of it illegally and murders someone but the Law & Order party love him?  I mean what?
They will both get what is coming to them.
America loves racism
at least something positive today glad he free
because he's white
This fat little momma's boy had NO business with that weapon OR crossing state lines with it to go "protect businesses" he had nothing to do with. If you call this boy a hero, you are an abject failure in life. Plain and simple.
Here's what the headline should be: "This morning teen charged with defending himself is allowed to be let out on bail until the charges are dropped"  https://youtu.be/39sMHoKUBGc
I have to give that kid a lot of credit. He could have taken out 15 terrorist by emptying his clip. But he showed real gun control and only took out 2.   Oh well, better luck next time.
Now go arrest the A holes that attacked him.
Good for you Kyle
The original my pillow founder is actually deceased since January or February of this year. His widow lives in Clearwater Florida in the country side area and his two sons live in Virginia. I only know this as a family member works in medical at the widows home every week. I assume your news station is wrong and mentioning the current CEO since the founders death. This disgust me knowing that the company bailed Kyle out. The my pillow family are all big financial donors and friends with trump which is not helping matters at all and just shows the negativity of violence who supports Trump today.
God Bless Kyle Rittenhouse
Disgusting.
Self defense is a legal right to a American.  Those who attacked Kyle got what they deserved.  I would have done the same thing
Gotta have the complexion for the protection.
OMG my last name is Schroter but its a T instead of a D
Justified killing
I find this disgusting
Great, let's make him the victim now.  Two wrongs don't make a right, or maybe they do now.  This is not going to end well, maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt it.
This is sick.
Excellent!! Patriots vs terrorists is what this is about
Watch the video of the scene. Clear self-defense. Ran away, was attacked while on ground, turned and fired. Clear-cut case, if nobody is being blatantly bias.
I bet kyle incriminated tf out of himself during the investigation
He'll be put in the ground within days.
See, self defense is when someone comes into your home and you shoot them to protect your family.  This is murder.
Keep setting the example for future generations that it's acceptable in this country to murder people in the streets because republicans will bail you out. That should go over well.
self defense 100%
WTF
Republicans are traitors and murderers and terrorists and kidnappers of Democrat governors KKK   And Fraudulent
Kyle is a piece of trash murderer
Unbelievable, people calling this guy a hero. What did he do that makes him a hero? He killed people and to the Trump cultist that makes him a hero, which goes to show how low the cultist morals are, as well as how much their hatred for those who do not think like them is. You all need to look up what the definition of what a hero truly is. Disgusting!
Good thing I've never bought a pillow from that guy, lol and now never will.
Criminals helping a criminal.
Self defense
That guy doesn't deserve to be out.
He is innocent. Self defense all the way home. #freekyle
I'm glad he's out
My Pillow Guy thinks murdering people is fine.
Glad he is home with his family. It was self defense. If I was getting hit with a skateboard a deadly weapon I would defend myself too.
HE IS A PATRIOT BECAUSE HE WAS PROTECTING THE SHOPS THAT WAS VANDALIZED BY RIOTERS AND IF HE DIDNT PULLED THAT TRIGGER THEN HE WOULD BE DEAD THAT DAY
⊹⊱⋛⋋💙 I VOTED F0R BIDEN AND HARRIS! 💙⋌⋚⊰⊹
God bless the hero
fun fact the my pillow guy built his pillow empire with the help of cocaine.
POS I hope he gets LIFE!!!!
Ew..
God Bless America.  Freedom of expression - Article 10 of the Human Rights Act: Freedom of expression Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.  Thank you for being 100 transparent regarding your support for Kyle. Michael Lindell (Lindell is a devout Christian and received an honorary Doctor of Business from Liberty University in 2019).  Jerry Falwell, Jr. turned a struggling Christian school (Liberty University) into a billion-dollar enterprise and became Donald Trump's evangelical wingman until he was removed due to an unfortunate family scandal.  Ricky Schroeder (In April 2019, Schroder was arrested twice for suspicion of domestic violence, and was held in lieu of $50,000 bail).  I had not seen Ricky on TV lately and glad to catch-up.
You go KYLE!!!  The WHOLE NATION stands behind you.  You are a blessing to many people, and you have a good heart.  May God bless you a million times over.
Kyle was just taking out the trash.
If this is true, this was NOT a smart business move.
He posted bail thanks to a crack addict.
Imagine actually thinking he was criminal after seeing all the evidence of him defending himself, and then you remember there are fascist pedophiles running around chasing kids with guns like they won't get shot at after they proceed to attack said kid.
He innocent. Self-defense all the way
He's still a murderer.
Mike says if Trump wins we gonna need this boy back on the streets
Finally some good news.
If he was black he would have been shot at the site of the crime.
Bail should have been denied for this murderer.  Self-defense ended as a possible outcome for him when he self-presented as a vigilante soldier.
he's really a good kid. he just showed up with an assault-style rifle to murder some unarmed people, but he's 'really a good kid. I'm so glad my tax money went to him so he could buy an over-priced piece of machinery to murder some people. All hail his god trump.
This headline rofl, what timeline is this
Awesome...thanks pillow guy n Ricky...self defense from those thugs is NOT murder..they were going to take his life..he fought back...its on video...end of story
It was self defense, and I'm SO glad he made it out!!
I will definitely be boycotting this vendor!
This criminal needs to see jail time.
Thank goodness the wall is nowhere close to be done, the kid can still yeet into Mexico.
Oh no he's going to lead a military strike against the media involved in lieing about him
"Claims" he was acting in self defense. We all saw the video. There's no claiming. It was self defense. Glad he's home for the holidays.
Illegal weapons charge alone should nail him. Or every hypocrite on here would be railing about if he was black.
So the my pillow guy and the ricker are in the same page. That’s, cool, I guess.
Don’t F with Lin Wood. He stands for truth.
He was giving first aid to people rioting defending businesses stopped BLM protesters from pushing a flaming dumpster into a gas station and then started getting shot at so he had to defend himself. all while getting knocked over and beaten with a skateboard he managed to defend himself and ward off all the attackers and turn himself in right away with his hands up
Gross....guy is on trial for murder and they are smiling together wtf. Hope they use that against him to show 0 remorse for the lives he took.
All these people talking about self defense. You know what it REAL self defense? Staying home and away from a situation you deem so dangerous as to need a gun. The kid wasn't legally old enough to be carrying a gun in WI. He wasn't protecting his own property. If you go out to protect some other person's property you are LOOKING for trouble, and looking for trouble isn't self defense. If the kid wasn't carrying a weapon he wouldn't have been a target. People providing medical help don't get targeted, but people looking for trouble tend to find it.
You don't put money to bailout criminals.
The world we live in SMH THIS IS WHATS WRONG WITH THE PEOPLE ITS NOT ABOUT BLACK OR WHITE ITS ABOUT WHATS RIGHT AND WRONG AND HES JUSTIFIED THEN HEY IT IS WHAT IT IS IDK
I am cancelling my pillow order!
Awesome!!!!
Thanks for wealthy patriots just sold me a my pillow
Kyle did nothing wrong.
Kyle is a hero
Good
Kyle is innocent.
Another W
how do u even get a bail set for murder?
H E R O
You won’t be able to bail him out of Prison.
I love my MY PILLOW now Ile buy 2 more
A white 17yr old with a rifle not legal to have one!...what if he was a black kid with a rifle...he would have been shot and killed...smh!
Out long enough to put on some muscle before he needs it. Don't drop the soap
Thats Amazing! We love you Kyle! The truth will fully exonerate you!
just wow
I didnt even kno a juvenile can post bail
Video would not play
The teen that defended himself from multiple perps.
That was NOT a protest in Kenosha. Whole bunch of rioters and domestic terrorists
WELP now there will be a full on manhunt ;)
funny all you want to talk about is self defense and how he was being chased, go look at what started it. he walks up and shoots a guy in the frickn head, that's why he was being chased, self defense my @ss. He wanted to act like a big man with a gun well now he can pay the big man price
well I just lost all respect for the actor, if he's in any movie or show,I won't be watching! I also won't be wasting any $ on those overpriced bed pillows! Thanks for making the choice easy!
imagine wasting 2Million on him
I chip in, free Kyle.
A mother(or father) should not be allowing their 17 y/o run the streets at night. Black, white , whatever. Poor parenting. He illegally crossed state lines with a weapon. His friend should be charged too. Contribution to delinquency, fraudulent purchase of a firearm(straw purchase), maybe kidnapping. This didn't have to happen. And yes the first guy he shot was a wack job to but, if he had been at home studying geometry he wouldn't have been in jail would he?
#FreeKyleRittenhouse and he's a hero for killing those domestic terrorists
A family of psycos....
I love how they called the riots in Kenosha a "protest"....if you knew how the town was before the riots you would understand.  I hope this kid gets off, he was just exercising his second amendment rights protecting himself and property from being destroyed.
Rickey must be stupid to !!
The whites will always aid the whites.
This country is disgusting
Wow a White man getting out of jail for 2mil, if he was any other race he would of never had a bail put on him in the first place, let alone someone putting 2mil to get him out. White privilege
So self defense is now a crime? The left have lost what little minds they have.
Amen about they let that young patriot out.
No more my pillow for anyone.hes a murderer.no self defense.id he stayed at home nobody would've died  smh my pillow
This is america
Do they return the bail after a decision is made?
White privilege
Racism is so deeply entwined in our culture I am afraid even re-education camps and rebuilding Auschwitz's ovens in Greenwood isn't enough. This murderous child was given two MILLION dollars to insure he can keep killing black and brown humans. By the MyPillow guy. THERE'S your next target. Support Fascism, meet the ovens. NEVER AGAIN!
The kid will still be spending years of his life in jail.
Why hasn't the guy without the elbow been arrested?  He was pointing his pistol at Kyle's skull after Kyle lowered his weapon.  He even posted he wished he had pulled the trigger and killed him.  Media did a fluff piece on the p.o.s.
Kid deserves what his victims got.  No matter how many fascists love him up, he’s in serious trouble, and will be doing some jail time.
BasedPillow
Time for all the pedo, criminals to start crying.
he may be safer in jail
Gd for him he is NO MURDER SELF DEFENSE WHICH EVERY PERSON IS ENTITLED TO
Kyle is HERO
It's crazy how the u.s. lets its citizens carry killing weapons like that. That's domestic terrorism.
Self defense all day!! How blind are you idiots to not see that this kid was being bullied and attacked. It was his life or theirs! This kid had the courage to go out there and risk his life to protect the property and freedoms of others and with the evidence put forward you cowards have the audacity to say he had no right to protect himself?! Guess what they’re dead and he’s not thank God for that. God Bless America and God Bless our President Donald J. Trump✝️💪🏽🇺🇸
do you have  any doubt it was self defense, NBC? who cares if Lindell is Trump supporter?
Hi is a murderer but on the other hand he is used by this right wingers.
A murderer is bailed out of jail by a wife beater and a coke addict.
The lesson here is to never chase down someone who has an AR-15 around his shoulder. Pure self defense.
If you actually have a brain and know how to use it you would know that Kyle acted in self defense! Do your own research!
He’s only out on bail... this isn’t fu*#ing monopoly. He killed 2 unarmed people... They’re  gone forever because a scared kid with a large gun shot them dead. He will pay for that mistake. I can’t believe so many people are ok with what he did, calling him a hero... Real heroes don’t use guns.
He's a murderer.  He shouldn't have been in WI that night with the weapon.  This story will end with Kyle in a prison cell, depressed, and ruined... :)
The Kenosha Kid walks.
Where was Kamala Harris? ...nevermind, not her favorite flavor.
Awesome! We need more people who will stand up to these violent animals of the left.
Finally, a good news story!
Crook
Great guy My pillow. Yeah the kids a hero!
I guess Ricky's career will.... well it will be the same as it has been for decades... over. Maybe he and Chachi can do a reality show called Washed Up Losers Desperate For Attention. Oh, and Trump's a LOSER! LOL!
I heard he was a very impressive marksman and his shot were not random. They were a deliberate self defense.
How completely DISGUSTING!
80 millions who voted for Trump will defend this country with every inch of their breath!
Self defense? Ridiculous why is a 17year old walking around with a rifle asking for trouble. Imagine this kid is anything but white . He would be in prison   100 years . And trump would be calling for more. I just don't see how it's ok to walk around with a gun and shoot some one and call it self defense crazy
Disgusting celebrating a child killer....what a sad situation
Good news! Why haven't the individuals attacking Kyle been charged?
Thank God I never bought that pillow!
Great news for Kyle.
Love it. As a black man it’s good to see someone not get unjustly jailed we don’t have to share the same skin color to know what’s right and Kyle was out there doing the right thing. Providing aid and helping tone down the chaos. All those thugs that attacked him should be the ones in jail right now.
Shameful
so he got bail out by a  coke addict pillow maker and Ricky schroder now we know they're racist
kid wont be able to leave his house
Kyle you did nothing wrong....It's a cryin shame there is such SorryLeadership in Wisconsin, to even put you in this position..... Thanks to All who have helped this YoungMan.
More fake news narrative, framing him as a murderer. It was clearly self-defense as seen in the video.
Black Rifle coffee company is awesome too. Glad The Kenosha Kidd is out. He went to put out fires and take out the trash, he eventually ran outta fires...
It always throws me off see Kyle R. because he looks like a girl. What is Kyle's preferred pronoun?
I sure am glad this kid is out of jail. I cannot believe the stupidity I hear whenever I turn on people like nbc or cnn. No wonder people have become so pathetically stupid in this country. If this is what they're listening to then I feel sorry for them. I shut them off years ago, and for good reason. They embarrass themselves. Kyle should have never been in jail to begin with.
Forget not that to commit murder is to go against the Ten Commandments. It does not matter if you are “taking out the trash” or not. You are not a hero in God’s eyes to commit murder.
Nice, Kyle is innocent and is being persecuted by left wing nutjobs.
Boycott My Pillow. Have the friend of Trump and his fascist followers hurt where they understand...in the wallet. "No more My Pillow". Rittenhouse is a criminal like his fascist Comrade Donnie.  Lock them all up! Love triggering the "uneducated voters" too. Update: This just in. Trumpy continues to lose again and again, while still defrauding this Cult Followers of their money (read the fine print...it's to pay of his debts and have money for him in the bank). Also My Pillow soon to raise money to start his own network called "SleepyTime for Donnie".
A new violent hero for the right wing. No shame whatsoever. This is the vigilantism trump keeps calling for. Using this lost soul. Pathetic. TgT
*ussy running threw the streets with a gun, hope he gets what's coming  the pen....
Why was he in jail in the first place...a blind man could see it was self defense.
he was XD
Glad he's out. He didn't do anything wrong to begin with. He was defending himself against those criminals.  Had he not defended himself, he would be dead right now.  Glad he made bail.  God bless the people that helped him.
What a shame. Murderers shouldn't be allowed to post bail. Poor people stay thrown in jail for minor offenses, and this danger to society gets to walk free with the help of big wigs. No more pillows from this guy. No Justice, No Peace!!!!
Disgusting
Video PROOF of self defense! We need more people like Kyle who will stand up for JUSTICE!!! BLM and ANTIFA are Domestic Terrorists~!
He was much safer in prison tbh. His life is in extreme danger now that he's out.
traveling hours away from home to use his rifle in the protests is tooooootally self defense
He should of never been arrested it was self defense I seen the video. I would of done the same thing
"Claims he was acting in self defense"   Any one who has watched any of the videos can plainly see it was self defense.
2020 is the most.....am I dreaming😴 wake me from this nightmare😱 tripping on mushrooms🍄year I've ever experienced in my lifetime 🤪
I was hesitant to buy a my favorite pillow before, this definitely makes me want to NOT buy it now. 80 million voters are higher in numbers than 73 million cult followers.
He never should have been arrested in the first place.
Im gonna love that giza cotton
Free gun with purchase of every pillow!
That DA is a Demoncrat and corrupt! Never charged the felon who pulled out a gun on Kyle!!
Defending himself from a hate filled democratic mob! We all saw the videos, and it clearly was just that. But the media will lie to you and tell you otherwise!
Self defense is when you are minding your own business & HAD to become involved,  This minor drove across state lines, grabbed a self-automatic gun which is illegal for a minor to possess,  prowled around the streets looking for trouble & killed two guys!!  That sounds pretty premeditated to me!!  WHERE is the self defense?!?  Also, where were his parents & the person who gave him the gun illegally?!?  Responsibility needs to be on ALL of them!!  It does NOT matter who the dead guys were OR what they did!!  Kyle CHOSE to be there with a gun; he is the one who shot & killed them!!  If we don't start holding people responsible for their actions, chaos will continue!!
WTF are you smiling about kid? You murdered 2 people.
Unbelievably some morons still think defending your country, your communities, your fellow Americans are causing troubles ? Either those are communism spy or one of those mobs who cause nothing but domestic violence!
And of course another shooting for their first story!! Mainstream media is the real virus people!!!!
What really happened "Young man involved of the self defense shooting of 2 rioters who attacked him and threw molotovs at him has made bail. This comes after rioters wanted to do everything illegal and expect to pay no punishment because they think everything is racist to them and when the people finally started acting in self defense to preserve the community rioters started assaulting these men who were protecting thier property which led to the altercation that had 2 criminal rioting thugs lose thier life"
Wow. Wtf has happened to our country?
He used the stimulus check money to illegally buy a 3D printed AR, drove to another state and opened fire at protestors in act of self defense. Rrrrrrrrrright.
Wtfffff, America you always amaze me with the stupidity you create
Ricky Schroeder that's just sad.
Hooray!!  Kyle Rittenhouse was acting in self defense!  Yes, we need to look at the case closely.  In the end, he will be found NOT GUILTY!
Good for him. He was attacked  by a marxist mob. Just watch the video.
in high school we use to prank call that my pillow hotline like 20 x a day
The wise person rid himself of infatuation and preoccupation of the five sensual pleasure, he sees that life is short and to be distracted, is like being snagg, and bound up, just as a fish is caught on a hook. Having taking the bait, it's cause for much suffering thereafter. He who sees me but does not sees the light is lost. He who see the light and does not see me will never reach nirvana.
Wow 😳
self defense and he just happened to have an assault weapon with him?
I saw the video.  Anyone who chases someone armed with an AR15 or any other firearm is clearly begging to be shot.
Wow, so Ricky Schroeder is a disappointment. Supporting a murderer.
My pillow guy = everything wrong with America
H E R O !
criminal.
I dont think 12 people can watch the video and say he wasn't defending himself
Mike Lindell is a hero and patriot!!! Buy from him!
Murderer
What the F is wrong with these people? Everyone of them have lost their common sense of decency. This man armed himself and drove there with one thing on his mind ... he was going to be the judge juror and executor. I am so scared. I yearn for ☮️ on 🌍
Libitards sure have the facts about this all figured out,oh and don't miss an opportunity to throw in some political bias why your at it. PATHETIC!
I want to give a Testimony on how I got Cured From Herpes . 7 Months ago I was Diagnosed of Herpes . I was having some outbreaks. I went to see a Doctor and many Blood Tests was done on me. My Doctor told me that there’s no cure for Herpes Virus I felt bad, I went online searching for a possible cure for Herpes Virus, I saw a post of IHIBOR A herbal doctor that cured someone from Herpes. I contacted him and told him how I’m feeling he said his herbal medicine can cure me. He sent me the medicine via Courier Service and I received the medicine some days after he sent it, i took the medicine as prescribed by him. Before the completion of the medication the symptoms stopped. I went to the Doctor and carried out another blood test, surprisingly I was Negative. I haven’t had any symptoms anymore, you can contact him Email address:_________________________________ (drihiborherbalhome@gmail.com) via WhatsApp +2349050141449 !!
I hope any show Ricky Schroders is on is  cancelled. Kyle is brainwashed and taught hatred like alot of young white males. This division only prolongs growth.
This is what happens when children play with guns.
Kyle is a hero! Saved himself from a felon with a pistol!!!
America stepping in. Absolutely innocent.
Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong!

Forcing someone to pay bail is racist. Right??
2 of the 3 people killed were child molesters. This kid deserves a medel not jail time.
Hey look it's the CRYBABY KILLER and his entourage.
looking at these sick comments from right wing nuts glorifying some brainwashed  murderer, really disgusting
Can already see the truth Hurts. Dont worry you will get used to it. :) One day " You will be a Minority" the writing is on the wall" See you then.
Silver Spoons - great show?  or best show of all time?  YOU decide.
Rittenhouse needs one of those pillows. He has the posture of an overgrown dwarf
Good.
The family and other friends and followers of Satan appreciate the donation.
you rightys are totally mental
Stay puffed marshmallow man w a gun lol
Check out the book The secret & Hunting virgins available now at Amazon and Barnes and Noble stores and online.
because it was self defense
Let’s create a petition guys to send him back
Good!
My God people are so filled with hate these days. What do you want?! For everyone to look and think like you?! Civil war?! So called Christians calling for war and hating everything that’s different but Your bible says in Acts 10:34-35 that God is not partial and that in EVERY NATION the man that fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
defund the police huh? fund Rittenhouse!
He did nothing but protect himself from violent DemonRat thugs!
Kyle should be given a reward for killing domestic terrorists.
You meant, "... lawfully killing two men IN SELF DEFENSE, ..."  "..., shall not be infringed."
This is creepy in many ways. And, no one should be let out on bail when they're being charged with 1st degree   homicide.
I knew they were going to bail out that murderer. Fascists love their white boys with guns. If it were a Leftist acting in "self-defense" there'd be riots and protests coming from the right screaming he was a cold-blooded murderer. The hypocrisy is strong with you guys.
Time to buy a My Pillow.
Wow. I have adored Ricky my whole life... I'm  47... now..... i have no respect for you.
He was not defending himself.  he went looking for trouble.  he should be locked away for life.
Never thought I would buy an expensive pillow but now I am
Rickey Schroeder?  wtf
That's just wrong. Crossed state lines with an assault rifle, had no business even being there. Kills unarmed civilians. I hope he skips bail. Either way he's facing serious jail time. Going to spend the rest of his life in the company of men.
I fully support a citizen protecting businesses and innocent people from rioters. Violence brings more violence. People supporting the riots need to understand that.
A has been and a wanna be perfect Trump supporters. Kyle is a murder and should go to prison they gonna love that little baby face.
Not for nothing but I am a Trump supporter but I see this kid to be wrong he should not have any assault wepon like that
I hope they sue they sue the state and that kid receives heavy compensation !
They are starting, to get people all worked up, especially black people, to do something outrageous. These people play a dirty game.. keep your eyes open.... please don't hate....
He wasn't a police officer. He wasn't military. He was a kid with a rifle. We don't take the law into our own hands or we go to jail. He isn't part of society anymore. He was a child combatant with no training or understand in the ramifications of using lethal force. Now as an adult he will have to learn the lessons and will always know he killed people. He wasn't on a mission, he wasn't responding to a call. He wasn't a trained officer. Just a kid with memories of killing other humans.
Who gave this man ( kid ) an AR 15 and who funded his travel expenses to attend the protest, and who convinces this killer he could roam around amongst the public welding an AR 15 semi automatic assault rifle. As far as the two idiots who posted bail are concerned, these two clowns are just as complicit in condoning the unprovoked act of double murder, under the lawfulness of protection, ( so called stand your ground law. )
It was self defense
This video was about maligning the bail posters and not the Rittenhouse story.
Nice to see some good news for once. My family and millions of others are praying for you Kyle ! God Bless you and Your Family .  Your a hero to many of us! Keep your head up !
He should be set free.
Leftist are socialist/communist  Funded by CCP  America is now CCP  Schools/colleges/universities are all funded by CCP  Support/buy CCP products Coronavirus will refuge for ever  This a curses when you supported CCP for almost 30yrs  From Bill Clinton to Obama Osama/Sleepy mental unfit Joe   Another curses is on the way @Mail in vote ballots fraud of all 300000 dead person vote casted    Get ready for 3C's
You're a MURDERER son, I'm so PROUD of you!
I'm happy with the my pillow I bought and yep this will make me buy something else than hopefully mr lidell will donate that money to help trump STOP THE STEAL.
🎶 For the best night's sleep in the whole wide world, buy an AR-15... dot com. 🎶
LOL make your bias any clearer?
Don't be fooled, he's going to jail for a very long time.  Even republicans can't erase two murders.  Self-defense won't work, it's all on video with witnesses.  Bye Kyle, your life is over!  You won't be missed.
if this kid doesn't win his case,  then this country has lost it's values
lol
BUT HE STOOD UP TO THE MOB
big props ! great news
Right on, my pillow Ricky Schroeder
I can't believe he shot someone who pointed a gun at him. What a monster.
he is an hero
He claim ?????  Did you see the video.
Sorry, don’t know my weapons, but Kyle does.
Good
Excellent news. He’s a hero and should never had been in jail in the first place.
Take note of every communist here that says Kyle is a murderer.
He should of never been in jail to begin with!
Lol this is crazy stuff
I still find BLM supporting Joe Biden to be absolutely hilarious.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmmahbbARNI&t=61s
he would've got killed by that guy who threw a bag of clothes at him, and the guy who couldn't even hold a skateboard right
Well now we know you can be underage after curfew in a different state you can murder ppl in the streets and buy your freedom with 2million.where is the justice 4 the ones who can't buy there way back home...great. message 🇺🇸..same ppl backing this murder terrorist are afraid of terrorism lol...
Feel bad for this kid. Another life ruined under the democrat media knife. Hopefully with the support he can turn around and sue the media like the last ones.
This is not a case of self defense.  Kyle Rittenhouse went to Kenosha with the intent to pull the trigger.  That's murder.
Why is this video twice as long as it should be?
my pillow guy is awesome :)
This is a classic example of why the American legal system is a bad joke.
There will most likely be many more self defense (murders) coming our way. Give the kid a medal. Atleast the media can entertain if no longer inform the public.
its called self defense
God Bless you Kyle! Thanks Mike and Ricky. True Patriots. People will wake up to the truth soon. im ordering 2 more pillows today, last 2 are still great but my kids keep taking mine.
I’m buying a couple more pillows today and watching metv. Lol
He was safer inside. What kind of idiots would think that it would be a good idea to let someone with that big of a target on them out into the streets?
I will never buy My Pillow.
Two people killed!
TRUE PATRIOT, HE WAS A FIREFIGHTER THAT NIGHT, AND HE WAS A MEDIC THAT NIGHT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE COMMITTED FELONY HOMICIDE. FREE KYLE AND FOR ANY MOB FULL OF A MALL GRABBING SKATER OR PPL WHO JUST GOT OUT OF THE PSYCHE WARD-TAKE THIS AS A WARNING, THAT PEACE WILL BE KEPT. KYLE KEPT PEACE THAT NIGHT BY COMMITTING A FORM OF HUMAN SACRIFICE. GOOD LITTLE SNOWFLAKE!
3 major organs form Kyle Rittenhouse, for this crime .  "I hope someone leaks his family info online"
That kid is a murderer,  plain and simple.  The trial will prove that.
Great news.  An absolute unquestionable American hero.
Drop all charges, the kid is innocent.  Those charges are a joke, since when is it legal to stomp someone's head or hit them with a skateboard.
I promise you... That boy will not stay free. He traveled out of town to "protect" people, and killed two. I know most of you have no regards for human life, but the fact still remains this kid killed two people trying to play vigilante and justice will be done.
These men are fueling this child's fears and hatred. Explointing him for their own ends.
why are my pillows much comfier all of a sudden
If Kyle and a goldfish were inside a burning building, I’d save the goldfish.
Isn’t it amazing that justice is now in the hands of the news media ! Will the constitution die in there hands ? Is it time to renew the three of liberty , for justice for all or just for those who rule .
Oh he'll be going to prison without a doubt! They just better keep an eye on him so he doesn't run while he's out now enjoying the little bit of freedom that he's got, cause it's not gonna last for him! I bet you alot of people are gonna boycott that man's pillow business now for helping a murderer get out of jail! I'm having a hard time myself trying to understand why he would do something like that....🤔
An underage kid illegally acquires an assault rifle, travels across state lines, blows a couple people away, and for that he's a hero??? Our value systems are wayyy off the rails politics be damned. Hopefully he gets every year of incarceration available to a judge to sentence him to. He'll still be alive, more than we can say for his victims
More accurate headline: TRUMP-SUPPORTING MURDERER WALKS FREE THANKS TO THE "MY PILLOW" GUY
Free Kyle
It’s just too and more of those peaceful protestors didn’t get more coming to them.
whatever you do you gone get yours returned double.....everything gets paid for.

Ok. Since 1/2 of you will not look into what happened, I guess I'll have to break it down for you. Kyle worked as a lifeguard in this town and was a trained EMT. He went there to help with his EMT gear (hence the blue gloves he was wearing) and of course his gun because he was headed into a riot situation. He is seen in many videos helping rioters that were hurt (by other rioters) and even seen putting out a dumpster fire started by rioters. He then went to his friends business to help them protect it. He was knocked to the ground and hit in the head with a skateboard. One of the assailants pulled a gun on Kyle but luckily Kyle was quicker on the draw and shot them before being shot. Open and shut self defence case.
Finally some good news
I'm sure the Leftist rage culture will seek to ruin this young mans life. In America, When did it become a crime to protect your life from a blood thirsty  mob?
Wooow WHY DID HE EVEN HAVE BAIL??!!!! This shows why the election should have went the way it went because it’s CLEAR the leadership needs to be changed when you have bull💩 supporters.
he shot a felon in self defense and  killed a pedophile  in self defense, so whats the big deal? he will win he court case.
Thank God he's free for now, hope his trial goes well and shows what really happened.
I only know what I'm told about Kyle... and...
Wow
I wasn't sure which of of you right wing twats to respond too, so to all of you crayon eatin mofos talking about guns, keep in mind   all liberals aren't against owning and using weapons. Hope this response was broad enough to insult all you little snowflake, cry baby losers.
$ 200,000 dollars just went into the Sate Coffers AND it was just released the 17 yr old bought his Gun illegally from an 18 year old . Guys  , it can't get any stupider than this . Pillow Guy will need to fork out million to cover the pending victims lawsuits ESPECIALLY the guy that the Kid shot his Bicep off . He will get more money than the 2 dead men's Estates . You Goops better start sending money ! LOL !
This is disgusting. The kid should have never taken the rifle there. He over reached and scared enough people that they tried to disarm him and he panicked. 👎
A Criminal Killer on the loose...
I am NOT a Trump supporter but I saw the video and clearly he didn't murder anyone.  He was defending himself.
Are you kidding folks? He drove to another state to a protest with an ak that his adult friend purchased for him (Kyle is a minor) with his stimulus check. He should be tried as an adult with the book thrown at him. This is a no brainer folks, get real.
THANK YOU Michael & Ricky---NOT he claims--he "was" acting in self defense!  He was there to help!
...really??? MyPillow guy bailed out this COD wannabe, it sounds like a joke
No wonder he never made it in Hollywood.
That’s awesome now keep him out. It was self defense
All the people who say Rittenhouse should be put in jail, should be beaten to death by an angry mob.
Well, thats white supremacy for you.
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THAT PILLOW WAS THE MOST COMFORTABLE
I'm sure they set up a go fund me account on this Rittenhouse kid. Pillow dude and little Ricky  just paid the difference.  Just saying Just assuming.
Regardless of your opinion if you can bring yourself to smile after killing two people for a photo op you have some issues
A country full of armed nutcases: US.
Shouldn’t go to a riot with a gun bound to shoot someone lol
White supremacists can rejoice.
Cocaine is a helluva drug.
That kids a hero!
Think of all the girls this kid is going to get.  So many.
There was a video covered by Washington Post that a lot of details about the incident people should watch. It is most like the person who bought him the gun who is going to get brunt of this because he lost track of Kyle during the night of the incident.
he better not go out at night.   he might get popped... then the pillow guy will have to pay for the funeral
It was murder.  Ricky Schroeder has gotten really  fat and rightwing as he aged badly.
So wealth buys you ur freedom.
if this was a black kid he would already be on death row
Don't let this distract you from the fact that a black boy was beaten and left in a sugar cane field in Louisiana a few weeks ago.
Disgusting.
Everyone in my family are now getting pillows for Christmas.
Disgusting
Hey was acting in self defense? What you met to say he was atack and was defending himself. Nice try to multiple everyone.
Self defense
Kyle Rittenhouse is a national treasure. We should all strive to be more like Kyle.
I do believe this was self defense but its still white privilege
Broken system, broken people.
Rittenhouse should of never gone to jail it was self defense and law and order in the country is gone especially with sleepy joe and bigot Harris in office a war is brewing and I will be on the right side
Awesome! People like Kyle is the reason we’re here. Good luck in court bud!
He better enjoy it because he should be going back for a very long time
Looking for some quick publicity I guess what has America come to
They all make me sick!  I’ll never buy a pillow from that POS!
hopefully his legacy helps put more filthy rioting pedophiles into the ground
FUQQING DEVILS.
the parents and everyone involved need to be indicted for creating this monster - and making the kid think murder is a 'good thing ' - did they forget that he didn't actually murder black people - he murdered white people ...
Good!.... it was self-defense he never should have been behind bars in the first place. the kid was getting lynched.
live by the sword===============================by the sword
Way to go kid. Good luck.
Thank you Mike Lindell, Ricky Schroder!  Kyle was clearly protecting himself from those thugs.
Lol I'd rather be in isolation then to be that kid
FREE ALL PATRIOTS!!
trump's amerikkka
2 counts of homicide ans attempt murder... he will recieve life in prison, the evidence in this case is not in his favour... Enjoy your freedom while you can
Pretty sure celebrities and politicians were doing the same for all the rioters...
home boy said i wanted to feel safe so am gonna leave my house with a rifle i shouldn't even have on me,  and then go to where the the riots are. Just so i can feel safe....  that some quick math. Must be nice to white in America. lord help us if he was black or even better if was a Muslim.
Self defense is the only acceptable form of violence, and it should be total.....Great job Kyle!!
Thank goodness he is free, self defense is not what it used to be
I've managed to go my whole life, all 40 years, without owning a gun or killing anyone. This kid can't even make it to 20. You can debate who's at fault till you're blue in the face, but the fact remains that America needs to do some serious soul searching. This isn't the wild west anymore, guys.
He should be free. Hes a hero love this young man 😁🤗👏👏👏🙏💪
Good for him. The prosecutor should be shot for treason to play politics over the law.
if he were black there would of been no bond.
This is proof that patriots still exist.
Money rules the world. But you can't escape Karma.
God is ready to burn America for this
It was self defense if he would not have shot do you think he would be alive now
...
Kyle keep your aim high. Good luck!
He claims he was acting in self defense because that's what happened. He shot at people after they swarmed him, assaulted him and one of them had a gun. How is this not self defense?
The Kenosha Kid  has done more to exemplify the difference between talk & action , between left and right ,between a lone individual and the mob ,and between posing and taking action . When President Trump visited Kenosha ,he said he saved the city  ; in reality it was Kyle  who actually saved the city ,his actions saved his own life and the city of Kenosha.The way he cleared his jammed rifle as the "Glock Dude" attempted to murder him was classic , a statue needs to be erected in Kenosha of Kyle  in an action pose ,anyone of his actions presented plenty of statue like poses . Don't Skate on Me should be on one side of the plinth holding the monument. TRUMP2020  P.S.  If I were defending him ,I suggest that the persons shot dead both tried to steal his  rifle ,both did not realize it was attached to him by a sling ,and their pulling on the rifle caused it to discharge , he was holding on to it but the  2 attempted thefts were responsible for their own demise , look at the videos ,see for yourself . America thanks you ,Kyle .
Terrible taste
The news media doesn't want to even talk about the facts because its so obvious the kid is innocent of the charges.
Boycott my pillow not that I would buy that junk in first place
People defending this criminal are sick
Lord Jesus, have mercy on us all.In your, holy name i pray.Amen
Good.  Self defense is not a crime.  This is a case of the charge being the punishment.
An American Hero.
Wow what a gut punch childhood, not Silver Spoons great Rickey Schroder...lol
He should have killed more
They need to send him to Hong Kong. If the pro-Democracy protesters had him protecting them, those triads wouldn’t stand a chance
No JUSTICE, KARMA  KARMA
I hope they get him before he’s sent back to jail 🔫⚰️
the fact the I know people charge for less without of bond yet you have a white male killed 2 people and gets a bond we need to fix this judicial racism if you  the crime you should do the time for those who say was ok gang members protecting their neighborhood anytime they're charge for something
The kid has a lot of support I wasn't there so I don't know what went on but I hope this kid realizes He's in a jam.
He was acting in self defense  his case meets the criteria  for self defense  hes a political pawn
Feel like burning my my pillow
People are happy that he's out but with the charges he's facing you gotta realize he's going to do some solid time. He should not have been out there.....should not have crossed state lines with this in mind.
MAGA GANG, KAG GANG. The Kenosha kid will go down in history as an American Patriot.
his days are numbers
Wow? When a white guy shoot people on cam its self defense, but when a black guy who doesn’t even have a gun it’s supposedly an act of resisting arrest? There is law and order it’s only base on power and discrimination against people.
Plane and simple self-defenses case closed. Not guilty completely innocent.
the best way to sell something is to make the buyer passionate about it... the best way to make someone passionate about something is to make it political.
Well.... "My Pillow" is not going to be on my list of purchases. Ever.
He was acting in self defense
Good for Kyle.  Donate to his defense fund.  If dems steal the election Trump should pardon him and all of the police officers that had to deal with the criminals in the riots.
Even though I am against it, but sometimes death penalty feels the right punishment just. He had an illegal fire arm, killed 2 people for no justified reason and he is a celebrity!
Poor excuse for a human being, arming himself and going looking to start something.
Black Rifle Coffee got an ad they shouldnt want I am thinking?
Obtained an assault rifle illegally, traveled an extended distance to another community, marched carrying an assault rifle to intimidate people, fires upon unarmed individuals who saw him as a threat because of his armament so I guess his stance in court will be that he was just out for a walk in another city heavily armed and for no reason he found he had to shoot people because they threatened him.
Good to hear. It was self defense
Kyle is a hero.
Awesome true Americans to the rescue of an innocent kid👍
I honestly don't think this kid is a racist, he just doesn't know how to get along with people not like him so he tries to fit in, plus he is a Ricky Rescue. Put him in the same room as that guy that murdered Trevon and they would hate each other. (Like doesn't like like sometimes) He will be adopted into a hero by the alt right possibly turning him full on racist
Hopefully Kyle becomes a Cop so he can give 10min knees to these BLM people
I hear  he’s looking into being a shooting instructor  👉🏽for the 🚂#PROUDBOYS🇺🇸💨
Am I the only one wondering if they allow prisoners to bring thier own pillow to jail? 🤔  Bit more comfy, just sayin.
Those are his parents. Moms on the right.
Trump's favorite guys They have literally been in the Oval office And Trump promoted these guys businesses from the office in which the taxpayers pay
I do need some more pillows...guess I know where to buy them.
This guy belongs in jail.
BS charges. Self defense. I would've done the same thing
Great, lf he goes free, a real gun carrying Patriot like him should join the Army infantry or Marine corp. Iraq or Afghanistan is his meat.
Dox him.
Sounds about white...
the guy kyle shot was a convicted child molesting skumbag career criminal who is on video lighting dumpster fires and fighting numerous people other than kyle. he idioticly attacked a guy with a gun and paid for it.
glad hes out. he should of never been arrested in the first place. it was self defense.
Kyle the commie killer rittenhouse is a hero.
Time to buy a pillow . Hang in lil brother.
This is your brain on trump.
Rioters and looters: exists Kyle Rittenhouse: So anyway I started blasting
Question... one of the assailants that attacked Kyle Rittenhouse had a handgun... Is that guy a felon? If so, was he ever charged with illegal possession of a firearm???
Watch the VIDEOS... That's the only defense this kid needs #watchthevideos
Self defense
Kyle bought a gun ILLEGALLY.. with his STIMULUS check... how did a16year old get a STIMULUS CHECK???.. ..LAWS ARE FOR POOR BLACK PEOPLE.
Those commenters who are vilifying Kyle Rittenhouse need to ask themselves why we are so divided today that one citizen needs to carry a loaded AR to defend his friend's property and his own life these days and who is responsible for that. Remember, this shooting did not happen in a vacuum like a mass shooting at a school or a mall. This was a provoked incident and, yes, maybe you could argue that he should not have been there, I disagree, but then again, neither should the agitators have been there. If THEY hadn't been there they would have been alive today.
Fake Media doesn't know what self defense is. Not surprised
My Pillow is code for My Fellow White Supremacists!
The teen charged with defending himself from pedos and ex-cons was bailed today...there fixed your opening line for you.
kids going to prison no question about it he broke some laws and will be sentenced no question about it even if it was self defense
FREE KYLE!!!
Prime example of "White Privilege"
kids a hero in my book hope he beats the wrap.
Expected outcome. Kids going to need therapy for sure.
Thank u to mr. Schroder and mr.lyndell  for helping and American citizen out !!!!
Good.  He should never have been put away to begin with with the clear-cut self defense proof everywhere   Those antifa pedophile thugs should've been the ones to stay home.
I think he meant to say the Jacob Blake RIOTS! Available video evidence conclusively reveals self defense!
Aaaaah the land of the free, where money allows you to do everything you want... including murder people.
Kyle's parents should be arrested for child neglect.
Good. Should never have been charged in the first place
what a good boy, proud of you
He belongs in jail!  He had no business in that town nor was he old enough to carry that weapon!  He made very poor decisions and because of that he murdered two people!
How and why do these 2 people give a killer money to go free
When he is old enough HE should run for and win the presidency! Need more like him instead of these whiney...cry baby.....worthless....people that get offended and hurt by words alone. Bullets is the only thing to shut them up permanently.And if you are a person offended by my comment then SHAME ON YOU ! GO LIVE IN SOME OTHER COUNTRY AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING DOWN THIS ONCE PROUD COUNTRY.
He gave someone money to buy a firearm for him (federal crime), he was 17 in possession of a firearm you had to be 21 to own in his home state and 18 in the state he used it in (state crimes), he took a firearm he wasn’t legally allowed to own across state lines (federal crime).  Regardless of whether you think it’s self defense, he should’ve never been there in the first place. He’s a criminal. Law and order.
I won't be buying that pillow
During the Jacob Blake riot... There I fixed it for you!
Pardon Kyle!!!!! Kaylegh fer Prez!!!!!!!
The real hero is Anthony Huber who used his skateboard and whacked the loser in the head
How can Christians stand for this?! This is saying murdering people is ok.
That young man is a patriot. The left wing media just used him as a scapegoat. He defended himself against some ANTIFA clowns
Oh no.  I believe we're going to have extreme flooding with all those leftist liberal tears on the way!
God Bless the "My Pillow" guy..Another real American helping another real American..
White guy murder suspect: Makes bail Black guy murder suspect: What bail?
Bailing out, smiling & posing with a person charged with double homicide is one thing. "hey, your story is gonna get some GREAT exposure, could you wear this t-shirt and promote my coffee brand?" - IS America.  Regardless of how you feel about culpability, two people lost their lives.
Return of the king
Only delusional Incels and Trumpanzee losers support this freak!😂🤣🤮🥒🥒
Black rifles matter!!! Awesomely done.
It was self defense, just look at the video. The kid wasn’t there hunting humans.😔😔
Shot a guy that was running at him with a gun. Democrats are calling him a murderer because he is white. Simple as that
What a racist country how does a murderer get bail funny thing is though the two people he killed weren't they White
Thank you for Getting him out
It wasn't self defense as he claims the kid was scared and he chose to put himself in that situation he wanted to act like he was grown bottom line he was scared and he shot first killing someone I can't wait to see how many years he'll get for murder
So the little killer laughing because big money comes to his defense. Justice will come.
He'll be great jail bait 😂😂😆😂
So you people who are claiming self defense. How’d you feel if someone came across state lines with a rifle that he couldn’t even legally due to him only being 17. That the pint here he committed multiple felony’s along with murder just said cause if he was black and done this no bail no possibility of getting out plan and simple. Two justice systems. But he shouldn’t be out he murder two people and know those families have to think the person who murder their children is out and about taking pictures and smiling like wtf. Honestly lock him back up
Maybe the second murder was self defense but the first one was most definitely straight up murder...sooo if he didn’t commit murder in the first place people wouldn’t have been trying to turn him in and he wouldn’t have killed a second person. The prosecution rests.
When a man can’t stand up for himself and be persecuted if he does this country and our flag means nothing.
🖕🏽
uh yeah, because stalking people with an assault rifle is now "self defense".    make note of all the right wing fascists propping up this murderer.
Wow,wtf is going on
If I was knocked to the ground, then surrounded by a bunch of people trying to hurt me in a local riot situation, I would be shooting them as well. Notice that when he got up, he didn't shoot the people that weren't going after him.
Boycott the piece of 💩 Shameful evil racist are all I see on the picture 👿
America is suffering from antifa, blm low gene pool infection. These Advanced Fetuses sleep, eat and poop at a larger scale then smaller fetus. The Left angry that in the event of a Huge Natural Disaster...their kind will "go away" under the Darwin Rule Survival of the strongest, fittest. Ha...my kind wins.
Kyle Rittenhouse, the teen charged with killing two people in Wisconsin SHOULD GO TO JAIL LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP! LOCK HIM UP!  The teen should have been at home parents' fault sue them and LOCK HIM UP!
Best pillow I ever owned!
Wow, a 17 year old crossed state lines with a loaded rifle and murders two people, he can’t legally buy a pack cigarettes, buy alcohol or go to a casino. why does anyone of any political association think this is ok. It doesn’t matter the situation this is not ok in a so-called civilized country. Yes he’s the topic of today taking photo opps but what happens when all the cameras are gone and he’s locked up for 20years.
The amount of delusion in the comments for this video is astronomically saddening.
Lol right next to the video about manhunt for shooter
Vigilantism is the act of enforcement, investigation or punishment of perceived offenses without legal authority.  Kyle Rittenhouse, as a civilian, had no legal authority to "defend" the community and businesses during the protests. That's the job of the police and actual law enforcement.  His intent was to show up as a vigilante and dole out justice as he saw fit, and as a result, two people died by his hand.  He needs to be prosecuted and given a harsh sentence.  Law and order should not tolerate vigilantism.
Ricky Schroeder, huh? Well, he’s no Scott Baio, but I guess he’ll do. If only Zach Morris showed up and made everything okay. We need you Zach! Are you listening? We need you! We’ll even be okay with you bringing along Screech and Kelly!
This kid is a patriot and did the world a favor when he took out two violent thugs who attacked him!! #JusticeForKyle
I’m using my my pillow right now it’s seriously the best pirrow #freekylerittenhouse
Thank you Kyle
Amazing how quick everyone's judgements come. To be clear, Rittenhouse shouldn't have been in that situation to begin with. That being said, BLM rioters began chasing him unprovoked, ands as he ran away one of the assailants shot at him. That's when he fired back, in self-defense. Then a second person confronted him, attempted to physically remove his weapon, and he fired again, in self-defense. Under the law, he will not be convicted.
I'm sure this *infuriates* the fragile and unhinged Left. Good.
Boy is going to prison. For a long time.
Anyone who watched the entire video cannot deny this was self defense. This poor kid should have never went to jail.
The criminals are blm and antifa. If you dont get that, you will when trump is elected for 2nd term. And they start trying to burn down your communities again. This kid shot criminals! If the cops did their job regular citizens wouldn't have to. Blame the pathetic democrat governors and mayors letting blm burn, loot , murder destroy their cities. You think that's ok?!
The radical left created Kyle Rittenhouse just like they created Donald Trump,  Both might be going away for awhile, but they are not destroyed and will return in some other person , When ever there is a void created, it is always filled by something else, take for example Democrat  cities that defund their police departments or  have D.A that don't prosecute leftist rioters or ones that engage in other violent crimes , this creates a void in law and order, if the leaders we elect no longer want to maintain our safety or protect our property then the citizens will step up and take the law into their own hands, Trump himself once said, If The Democrats had not done such a lousy job of managing the country , He never would have been elected in the first place or even run for the office,
welcome home kile We The People are with you
Young man gets rail roaded by state propaganda!  The guy with the hand gun was a convicted pedophile!  *Go Home Today, you're drunk!*
Enjoy your time on the outside, kid.  Freedom is going to be short-lived, with a lifetime of misery to follow.
Trumpkkk is a f.ukkk up!!!
I don't know how you people hating on Rittenhouse are so lost.  However I understand you all because you are fed lies by the media 24/7 and probably hate Jesus Christ and everything in the Bible.  Still many conservatives still try to Love you people despite your blindness.
He still will have to face court on Dec. 2nd and maybe jail time.  Wisconsin does not mess around - they charge 10 year olds as adults.  Also the families of the 2 murdered men and the  the medic Gaige Grosskreutz that he shot in the arm will sue Kyle Rittenhouse in civil court. They will take his money. Also no pardon from trump because he will no longer be president by the time the trial starts.
He will get his day court then go bye-bye for years and years.
Can't believe this kid's been in prison this whole time. I hope he can sue the government when all this blows over
For any idiots claiming he murdered anyone, you can clearly see in this video that he is chased down the street by a mob, hit, and then thrown to the ground with several people trying to stomp him before he even fires the first shot.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iryQSpxSlrg
Well done America, let's glorify murder!!! In name of the clown.
The My Pillow guy and Rick Schroeder - now that's a pair.  I think I'll go back to calling him Ricky.
This is great news. Self defense against violent anarchists, child molesters, felons is not a crime. It was the feel good story of the past year.
Glad he’s out. Justified shooting.
yes good luck
Buying more My Pillows.
Just an another example of white benefits.
I stand with Kyle Ritterhouse. He shot 3 felons who were breaking the law. What am I missing??
Y’all really sitting here praising this dude like a hero fr 🙄😒😒. So , crossing State Lines , With A Gun just to run the streets is nothing wrong to y’all ? Smh .  🤔😒😳 ..    Y’all Sick And , Twisted 😷😪 ..
He should be free with no charges
Proud Killer of 2 people poses with fans.
He probably won’t be charged because they most likely can’t prove anything in 1st degree, if they wanted to incarcerate him they probably should’ve charged him with 2nd degree. Glad he’s out tho
I'm sure Trump will pardon this turkey.
Good hope he gets off man he is innocent
it was self defense. all charges need to be dropped.
And THIS is why there should be NO bail for murderers in America. This is disgusting.
The repubs love them some war criminals—why not just random killers too?
👏👏👏 he was innocent thank you Michael lindell !
So was the felon with the handgun not charged?
This is America.
It’s interesting how the people who call him a murderer fail to back up that argument.  I guess they would rather see this young man chased down and murdered by the mobs who wantonly and willfully were terrorizing the streets of Kenosho over several nights?  If having the RIGHT to defend your own life is not American, then I am not sure what is.
I know a lot of guys here seen to think Kyle Rittenhouse is innocent or a hero. They think Adam Lanza, Nicholas Cruz, Omar Mateen or Patrick Crusius that way too.
I’m on rittenhouses side but something about posing with a killer for pictures and smiling rubs me the wrong way.
Not guilty.
He should have never went to jail in the first place!
hero
Its nothing like a cult member bailing out another cult member...its team spirit
For all you idiots posting in that state you cant claim selfdefense when your illegally carrying a weapon people. Also what he did was not self defense so next time you idiots want a good Samaritan to stop a crime remember this because its same situation only difference is those good Samaritans were murdered.
Wtf...
Again its not self defense once he committed a crime. Aka when he tried to play hero. Sorry but don't yall scream to let the police do their jobs instead?
Free Kyle
My Pillows for everyone this Christmas.
There's plenty of right wing nut jobs to bail him out.  They won't keep him out of prison though.
That's awesome God bless Kyle he should become a shooting instructor on how to handle riots
It's disturbing how many disgustingly ignorant and homicidal people there are in this country. Now we have random nobodies endorsing murder. We are so messed up as a nation. Biden/Harris need to fix this lethal problem
Poor kid is getting railroaded.  But he should of knew better than to be out there.  It's over for the inner cities and surrounding areas.  It might be over for the coastal states in general.  Get ready for massive migration out of the cities .. the ppl that can afford to move that is.  The rest are gonna be there alone with no police .. good luck. That's what the ppl voted for though .. so I guess democracy does work.
Ricky Schroder LOL.  Why do Repug celebrities have so little talent?
I’m totally gonna buy a bunch of my pillows now!!
Sick, disturbed kid destroyed by hate and politics.
he claimed? in most cases you all say alleged, but you have been lying for 5 years in all things political
Deplorables, washed-ups, all of them.  Their 15 minutes is over.  Another batch of brainwashed trump nutsac lickers.
if Trump had a Son he would look like Rittenhouse.
🖕 this kid!
He's a first degree murderer. Drumpies are sick, sick people.
Good! Thank God! He should not have been in jail. It was clearly self defense. Im glad these men stepped up to help him and his mom. May God bless and protect them all.
Kyle Rittenhouse is a thug. He should have still held in police custody by denying bail. And what's Ricky Schroder doing with that My Pillow creator?
Charged with two murders and bail is an option??
life no parole
He shouldn't even be in Jail. Justice for Kyle
lol look at all the russian trolls on here!! hahah!!! If ur an American and ur negative bs is on here, u have no real backing. It's Russians and chinese!
well this explains the mall shooting
I'm placing  a order today to My Pillow.
God bless you pillow man and to kyle you did the right thing god bless you
He won’t live for long 🥴 they fina catch him lacking
If he had been black, he would still be sleeping on his Dirty Pillow in a cell. White Privilege! One day, one day, the shoe will be on the other foot Its coming. Just like the Indians were a majority on this land and  now  a minority,  White people will be a Minority soon. Then we'll see how they react. Its coming sooner than you think, just wait and see.
Kyle was only defending himself. Thank goodness he’s a free man! 🇺🇸
Put Rittenhouse on Rushmore for deleting those two fuckwits
1) he was underage and could not own that gun 2) he crossed state line  So everyone who keeps saying self defense, yes, maybe it was but again 1) he had no reason to be there as he was underage and not legally able to own that gun and 2) he crossed state line to be there.
He is a stupid kid that doesn't deserve jail time of more than a year.
White privilege
The 17 year old that came from another state with an illegal firearm is somehow a victim?! He came ,he saw,he shot! ,he killed! Am I missing something?!
Republicans are pro-murder, not pro-life.
Time to do unto others as they do unto you.
You know the reason the mob went after him, is the same reason the left went after Trump right?  He put out a dumspter fire, literally.
They’re all so happy being associated with a MURDERER! Why am I not surprised. This is just how the so called ‘conservatives’ are.
only those dumb person are happy for him.
Disgusting, especially the ones who think he’s innocent
I'm buying a couple My Pillows now.  #freekyle
Last I looked...shooting UNARMED people...and HERO'S trying to DEFEND THEMSELVES...and STOP  a ARMED Mass shooter...and TRYING to stop a ARMED SHOOTER...with a skate board...and getting MURDERED over it...is COLD BLOODED MURDER....but trump cult worshipers call it..."defending their cause"....true fact...prove me wrong...
Just another sign of tRUMP disease. So sick of all of the them
Two million dollars wasted.
You better watch out liberal, the other half of America is watching you through crosshairs, listening and studying your every moves. Slow Biden and Kameltoe Harris will never see a day in the White House.
I feel like buying a My Pillow.
If you think what this guy did is "American" . You. Need your brain checked
And "trump supporter" wtf is your guys problem.
Kyle is an American Hero, they shot first. Remember he took out a Pedophile, a Wife beater and long time Criminal.......
If your not religious and you see things that aren't there than you are considered schizotypal... But some how when you claim your a believer than your not????? Nothing left but ignorance on this planet.
The kid brought it upon himself. Acquired the gun illegally and did not have to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And, just to reiterate,  KID.
Good. It was self defense. Media made him out to be a racist which is total bs.
10% of 2 million is $200,000.  I got more than that sitting in my maxed out FDIC savings account.
Kyle Rittenhouse is the Covington Kid 2.0 , media are about to pay him big after the lawsuits get filed
Good. He shouldn't have been in there, or charged with anything, for defending his life to begin with.
Can’t wait to see the advertising for my pillow later..."With my pillow, your 100% money back guaranteed the Zzz’s you need. Even your cry baby lefty democrat commie enemies will be Resting In Peace. My pillow, your pillow, America’s Fu(king Pillow!" Americaaaa...F yeah, coming to save the mutha fudgin day, yeah!
Kyle Rittenhouse shall lock him up rest of his live.
Way to man so glad you are out
A cowardly racist murderer is being cheered. Ugly Commie Traitor and Avowed Racist Trump has turned this country into a true sh*thole where the racst sh*theads have crawled out from under rocks and green swamps to celebrate this ugly, murdering punk.
Watch him get acquitted and then go on to commit more murders...
Hey the bigger question here is that.... Rick Schroeder has any money!! Wow I don’t think he’s done anything since like 2005!! 🤣🤣🤣
Doesn't mean he is free.
It's about time. Good to hear he is out of jail.
Did his mom drop him off at the mall outside of Milwaukee after he got out?
not surprised
looks like the dawn of the leader of the free world is inevitable.
WTF
In other news, certain people continuously spend good parts of the lives in jail for simply smoking weed and don't have access to bail. And certain people get bail, as they always have. This is America.
I love My Pillow and Mike.
A true American Hero
It was self-defense but he shouldn’t have had a gun out’there (1), (2) he shouldn’t have been out’there unsupervised.
Great! It’s much better that someone who was attacked makes bail instead of all those people rioting and burning down livelihoods.
The MyPillow guy is as big a conman as Trump himself
mY pIlLoW sUpPoRtS wHiTe sUpReMaCy!?!?!?!?
Why is a underage kid there anyway
Kyle Rittenhouse: Based Physical Removalist.
he should have never been jailed in the first place
Good. He is a saint.  And he was protecting himself from terrorists
Great news. Good to see this kid out o jail.
this kid was defending himself BUT let's not forget that he was carrying a weapon illegally. He was not of age to purchase a weapon and so he had a friend buy it for him.  This is what happens when a young person has a lot of power and does not know how to use it, he was too quick to want to use the gun.   The people who tried to take the gun away from him did not have a gun.
1st of all a AR-15 is not a assult rifle Also if your a gun owner you would know it was self defense, he will get changed with reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm However the time he already spent will be time served
public castration is a good idea. idgaf about this loser murdering pos. he'll just faaaaaade like the rest of the nazis over time. lol at when he gets penetrated in prison, AGAIN.
Lol they lost a bunch of fans bonding out a murderer thats white privelage for you if you dont know what that is now you do
It would seem liberals are fine with death and destruction, but not self defense. I didn't see a single libturd complain when Skank Harris offered to pay bail for the rioters.
He's gonna need those pillows to stuff his mouth as Big Tyrone turns him into his jailhouse woman!
Drop the charges it was self defense.
Punk brainwashed kid wanted to play policeman and now people are dead. Leave riot/crowd control to the professionals and stay home.  His parents should also be arrested for allowing him to have access to an assault weapon. America is a diseased culture when kids can carry weapons and pretend they are in a militia.
Good luck selling 100 dollar pillows to the other side
Now you know this world is gone bad someone killed two people and you let them out whoever that judge was wrong jmw
You can clearly see in the video that it was self defense. The MOB chasing him was clearly violent and had already fired shots before Rittenhouse did. Kid should never have been in jail to begin with.
He never should have went to jail in the first place!
A true patriot
Ok. Won't be supporting "My Pillow" anymore.
White Privilege never seems to amaze me.
Why is this good news he should be arrested.he ‘panic shoot’ two innocent people . More innocent than him.
Kyle is a hero, Kyle the kommie killer.
Good news, shame what you MSM mobsters and media activists have done against him, you "journalists" should be in jail not Kyle.
Rittenhouse??? where is the time machine?
Good for him, he will be found innocent anyways
LOCK HIM UP
This is driving the left more than nuts than they were before.
My Pillow sales will now drop by 40%...
The kid was protecting his life from a grown man that was a convinced criminal that was chasing him and  had reason to fear for his life in all three cases.    Self-defense.
My favorite pillows
Repulsive. Period.
And this is why the judicial system and our democracy is in jeopardy. The democrats are only interested in the judicial system when it fits their narrative and it punishes the conservatives
It was self-defense and that's the truth
His attackers were supposedly just trying to calmly and gently persuade him with a firm tone that his wielding of a harmful weapon may cause bodily harm to the peaceful protesters who had nothing but love and good will for him and all mankind, and that his imposing presence was disrupting a Kumbaya chorus they were about to initiate. :)
TRUMP 2020
Dammit.  “Lonesome Dove “ has been my favorite movie . Knowing Schroeder is a Trumper is screwing with that now
Stop buying those racist My Pillows people.
They don't like it when the shoe is on the other foot....
So this kid murdered two people and injured a third and is considered a "hero" who was defending himself, but Trayvon Martin who was walking home from the store after purchasing candy and was stalked by a stranger, who had been told by the police not to follow him, had no right to defend himself.  Racism is real.  This kid and George Zimmerman are murderers.  Will the racist court system or biased prejudiced jurists give Rittenhouse a pass for murder like they did Zimmerman... time will tell.   I John 3:11-12  For this is the message you heard from the beginning ; We should love one another.  Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother.  And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brothers were righteous>"Jude 1:21 keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
Pretty Crazy how all these Antifa and BLM can murder, Rob Destroy Anything that looks descent in America and we never here stories about them.  This kid was a hero.  To bad he didn't get rid of more of the idiots  burning down america
Buy  my pillows now!
He should be in jail, his family should have been aware of what he was up to!
LOOKS LIKE THE MY PILLOW GUY IS SMOKING CRACK AGAIN!   No more sales at walmart
The reign of Trump is over! Maybe we'll see both of them serve time!
me looking for trump supporters and finding every comment is one LMAOO
It was self defense! Don’t be mad. Keep the same energy for the animals of antifa.
and so begins the countdown...
Ha ha Democrats waking up a few hundred outside CNN Protesting Fake News !
Same thing gonna happen to  trump protesters here in a few months
Ewww, just despicable.
nice!!... Michael Lindell  is  stand up guy...very generous of him
Right to Bare arms has no age limit on it, and if there was one, it would be clearly written in 2A. Congress do your job.
Grown man decisions comes with grown man consequences
Good!
Nice... glad to see him free.
They are going to hide Kyle which is exactly why the prosecution was stating he was a flight risk. There should’ve been no bail. He will probably end up in Russia somewhere and avoid prosecution.
Dummy Reporter "He claims he was acting in self defense" with his condescending tone.  The rest of us "yeah we actually saw the video, the kid's 'claim" is an accurate account".
I love how they say trump supporter...SO WHAT IF HE SUPPORTS TRUMP 🤣🤣 THE MEDIA IS A JOKE.
@0:24--Leftist Media: "[Rittenhouse] claims he was acting in self-defense" ...Odd that this video doesn't show the ACTUAL footage of Rittenhouse acting in self-defense. They've also stopped showing their reporters on scene, explaining the Mainstream Media Narrative of 'Most of the [LOOTING & BURNING OF BUILDINGS] were peaceful'!
Trump probably is gonna pardon him He’s already called him a hero
This hero protected business and life...sorry others lost theirs, shouldn't have attacked Mr. Rittenhouse or the township.
He murdered a guy.  Then made a phone call.  Then got chased and had to defend himself.  He needs to serve time for murder.
The Kenosha Kid! Hope he beats these bogus charges. He did nothing wrong.
YEAH! FREEDOM!!
Imagine posting a domestic terrorists bail proudly lmao
Pillows go well with flowers and a black limousine.
He did nothing wrong. He protected his community and gave aid to protesters untill they attacked him.
With a little help from racists you can accomplish much
He shld be in jail for murder
disgusting person, hope he gets street justice
thank God Kyle Rittenhouse is out of jail!
YEAH KYLE!!!! WE LOVE YOU BROTHER! NO WORRIES; TRUMP WILL PARDON YOU!!! STAY SAFE!!!
Why do so many people hate this kid he was defending himself
You cannot go looking for a fight and claim self defense.
The my pillow founder, a lazy piece of sh it (he made pillows) bails out a murder who went to another state to play war.. Both under-educated idiots out on the street.
glad he's out...he won't last long out in public
Kyle Rittenhouse is out of jail! 2020 isn't so bad after all!
Justice for Kyle. So glad to see him free. Now to win this BS court case
This wouldnt have happened if he was a minority
president trump wiil  pardon him should have already done it sad he didnt more of the trash off the street
Finally 👏👏👏 This kid’s going to make a ton of $$$ from defamation lawsuits that follow his exoneration.
He went with a gun. Did other people have guns? He came from somewhere else with a gun to what? Is there anything peaceful about a gun? Then he was running. Should have kept on running. Instead he murders. Self defense? No, it’s murder. What the heck was he doing bringing a gun? Unless he was going to use it. Right? You don’t pull a gun unless you intend to use it. That is clear
Oh black rifle coffee they are delicious
underage for the weapon, out of state, if his own soul doesn't do something about this, some one else will
stupid nerd went looking for trouble. then acted innocent once he found it.
Why aren't the dislikes counted on the individual comments? Afraid to hurt someone's feelings or the truth be told how stupid the liberals are?
Who wants to place bets that the Wauwatosa mall shooter is going to claim self defense? Cuz that’s where it’s going. Such a shame. This country is effed
thank you, my pillow, for making it so clear that no one should ever buy your products.
Suge knight bail was 20 million lol
Of course the situations are very different, but this brings up memories of another self defense case... George Zimmerman. The jury decided correctly in that one... let's hope history repeats.
I am in awe of these public figures making a public stand that will likely get them attacked by the hordes of crazies in our midst, some of whom are posting here.  Good to see Mr. Rittenhouse getting this support.
Keep up to good work Kyle!!
I will NEVER BUY mr.POS Pillows ever......!!!!!!
He will be locked up. Trump thug
It’s about time he should have never been locked up  How many looters had gotten arrested and had a 2 million bail  And watch the video he was running away and the dude that got smoked just got out the loony bin and was chasing someone that had an assault rifle
Is someone gonna follow his lead and protect our streets from this wack job??? This dude is a clown, and this moron supporting him is everything wrong with America.  You really got people starving, being marginalized by society, homeless, etc....and this moron goes to bail a murderer out of jail.   Remember when you were all crying when Celeb's started bailing out peaceful protestors who were arrested for not even engaging in  or accused of engaging in violent acts?  But now, bailing out a murdered should be applauded.  Jokes
My only issue is that he never should have been down there with that rifle that was illegal for him to own. Getting involved to the extent that he did almost guaranteed that someone would get killed because yes, there are irresponsible people on the left which he knew he would antagonize and trigger. There is more gray area here than MAGA goons want to believe. Those people would be alive if he didn’t go down there with that gun. If an ANTIFA goon shows up to a Trump rally with a rifle and feels threatened, and he kills two Trump protestors in self defense, would y’all be making the same arguments for his release?
Sorry putting your self in harms way then calling it self defense is BS. Act like an adult get tried like an adult.  It was not even his own town. Looking for trouble by yourself is just plain stupid. If you want to go hunting people take backup.
She look soo sweet. Sweet lips Kyle will be in prison.  👨‍⚖👩‍⚖🕒⚖🤡
Can you act in self defense with an illegal gun? 17 year olds can't purchase AR 15s right?
He killed Domestic Terrorists, He needs to be given the medal of freedom🏅, I salute you sire you are an American hero 👍
It was a clear vase of self defense

If a group of rabid dogs charged at me with an ill intent, I would shoot those animals as self defense.
Boycotting my pillow founder...
He’s not a hero.  He’s a kid who played army and ended up killing two people.  Bringing deadly force to a volatile protest is not something to be cheered for.
hope you reported this as well equally "disgusting"  https://www.propublica.org/article/bloomberg-lebron-james-fines-fees-florida-felons and https://miami.cbslocal.com/2020/07/24/former-miami-heat-lebron-james-help-florida-felons-pay-legal-debts/
TODAY IS DISGUSTING PROPAGANDA
well BLM taste their own salt face
But nobody bats an eye when celebrities bail out looters are rioters? This kid was DEFENDING himself. Did you Woketardz see the video?
hope the kid goes to max security prison that doesn't have a Trumpist warden..  he won't have those guns to 'protect himself' anymore...  at least he'll be eating his salad...   30 times a day or rest of his life
Still trying to understand how someone facing 1st degree homicide is even given a bail...
Gross.
He needs to be in jail because if he was black
Go Kyle!! Wooo!
The media attacked this kid worse than they did to the Covington kids
I'm buying My Pillow products for ever!
Self Defense...caught on tape!!!
Hail Kyle! I'm buying a My Pillow....if he is convicted of murder by liberals...there needs to be a civil war....liberal democrats are the true enemy of America.
Should not have been in jail to begin with, period!
On today's episode of "If He Were Black, He'd Be Dead"...
Kyle will get off , self defense
"HE CLAIMS HE WAS ACTING IN SELF DEFENSE"... He WAS check out the video, dude barely saved his own life
Best Sunday morning news ever. ❤
Kyle protected himself from a mob of rioters and looters that didn’t want him protecting property. And for people that say “life is more important than property” need to realize that it is part of a persons livelihood and no one has a right to destroy it. In fact everyone has a right to defend their property and business. Kyle killed rioters that were criminals. One convicted of sexual abuse of a minor and the other domestic abuse and battery. Not to mention the guy who pointed a pistol at Kyle, Grosskreutz, was not allowed to have a gun due to his past crimes.
White guys with a gun is called a malitia, black guys with a gun is called a gang.
He was watch the entire video clip. For God's sake he was trying to run away towards the police for help
News flash, you didnt have to defend yourself if you wouldve stayed at home. Its like going to a peanut factory when youre allergic to nuts and your reason is you just want to see how peanuts are made.
He was attacked by a pedo just released from the psychiatric hospital , a wife beater , and a career burglar all with rap sheets a mile long. They were burning things and trying to destroy public and private property. Good riddance! He did a public service and I'm sure most Americans would agree if they were in the same predicament.
Domestic Terrorist Bailed out by supporter of Worst "president" in US History.  there fixed that for ya.
Right on I'm happy u got out ..Were praying for u youngster...GOD IS GOOD...NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF GOD AND WHO HE PUTS IN YOUR LIFE
Everyone has the right to protect themselves 🏋🏿‍♀️🙏🏿💯...
He should have NEVER been arrested.
That's fine when he eventually goes to jail,(and he will go to jail) he will be known as My Pillow Biter  : )
Kyle Rittenhouse is innocent ××××××××
As usual I'm Embarrassed & Disgusted to be a part of this insane human race unable to even identify the root cause of any of our problems... but will certainly service those problems for profit.
Everyone defending this kid just sounds mental. Saying it was "SeLf DeFeNsE", well he was underage and shouldn't have even been carrying a weapon. And he's not a cop or medic so he had no business even being there. And now two people are dead because of your "hero"
self defense might apply if he was defending his own property.  this kid went looking for trouble and he found it.
The media destroyed Kyles reputation....he should sue every single news network. They should all lose their jobs, PERIOD.
...HE DROVE TO ANOTHER STATE WITH AN ILLEGAL GUN...WHERE ARE HIS PARENTS?
He'll be locked up for good soon enough.
great. now American corporations are openly supporting terrorism
The punk with the gun is still screwed..just bought him a little bit more freedom is all ...your screwed punk..!!!
The video PROVES Kyle Rittenhouse was acting in self+defense. Unlawful arrest, unlawful detention, unlawful prosecution. Arrest them right back!
Protest? Does burning cars, assaulting people, and looting businesses sound like a peaceful protest? Glad my mans is out of jail when he shouldn't be in the first place.
Finally! Clear proof of self defense on video but the sheep will believe anything they're told by the corporate media brainwashing machine
Never, ever buying My Pillow products. Schroder just trying to find a way to be relevant again. Dude hasn't had a real gig since like 2011 lol.
Justice for Kyle.
May God Bless you always. Thank you so verymuch.
Disgusting
Money talks I guess.
The My Pillow Guy Bails Out Nightmares, sleep tight, locked and loaded.

Ad on a 48 second video. Devoid of any real content besides repeating the video title.
Will never buy pillows from that guy. Put this kids away
Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing illegal. He defended himself.
I still hate those my pillow commercials. Great job
Good! While I wish that no one would go to these senseless, destructive & ridiculous riots & looting fests (they’re NOT “peaceful protests”), this kid WAS clearly defending himself! He was hit over the head with a skateboard & his life was in danger!🙏🇺🇸
Great, he is a victim!
Kids gonna get life anyway so let him enjoy life while he can
Wow all the ways he could spend that on and he spends it on bailing out a double murderer. White supremacists really do have each others backs!
Rightwingers: "The left want to let murderers free to roam the streets"  Also Rightwingers:
SELF DEFENSE ISNT MURDER. SELF DEFENSE ISN'T MURDER. HE WAS ATTACKED BY SOMEONE WITH A GUN.
All these people have a track record to begin with so stop saying they are victims because they are black
So if a person does this to a Trump supporter as long as they're defending themselves than it's okay. Got it!!
Mr pillow is da man!!?
He should have never been in jail in the first place. American Hero!
That's good to hear. He's going through a crazy time all because some pathetic adults wanted to attack him yet they failed miserably.
You don't show up to a different state armed to the teeth and get to claim self defense. Sorry. That's like showing up to your neighbors house, inviting yourself in, killing everyone in the living room who tries to tackle and disarm you, and then calling it self defense. What are you doing at your neighbor's uninvited with a bunch of guns to begin with, dummy? For the record - all of those AR platform style assault weapons are offensive weapons.  Which is why they have earned the moniker "assault" weapon.
So glad Kyle is home!!! His case was 100% self defense! Real Americans support Kyle!!!!
Bail or no bail, he'll have to pay the butcher's bill at some point.
I hope he sues the lying propagandist MSM just like the Covington Catholic Schoolboy did.
What a waste of money for someone that will be convicted of murder.
Good news
Conviction pending.
LOL.  Not a good business move for MyPillow. Racists and Irrelevant washed up actors.  That is about right for Trump supporters.
best news I've heard in a while now, glad he's out never deserved to be behind bars in the first place!
hooray, the hero is finally freed from his unlawful captivity. thanks for saving future kids from the molester, kyle.
He's gonna get got.
He's a racist n that cheap product he has needs to boycotted , don't by that crap !!
No surprise here
He is a Patriot!!
They aren't going to get him charged with murder. 😂  Easy win. 😂😂😂
Once again, cameras prove the truth of self defense!
When a guy come out to the street carry AR-15 means he’s looking for trouble or willing to shoot someone...... he will end up paying for the killing... regardless how good his attorney .... they will lock him up..... he’s thinking will get away for the murder..... well he need to think twice because the prosecutor will go after him ....
How can he even sleep at night?... with a My Pillow of course!!!
The video clearly shows he was acting in self defense. What was he supposed to do? Throw his weapon down so he could get shot in the head by the Antifa "protestors". Video also shows him providing medical aid to people before he was chased by Antifa.  Seems like if its a Republican they aren't allowed to defend life or property. Only Democrats are allowed to do that....but of course they don't believe in having a gun to protect yourself, your family, or property.
Telemundo and univision fake News Before Trump Mexican people didn't have president just puppets for many decades Obamagate free gun's for the Mexican cartels operative fast and furious Free gun's to finish everything in Mexico Fake News providers did 3 time's frauds to Lopez Obrador using the hypnotized box called TV pay program by a few ones who believe in to own the world but Lopez Obrador representante we people and as people always going to  back for our freedom
If I get in a car, drive to another state and shoot two people can I expect Silver Spoons and a pillow too?
my stomach is sick
Protest! Ha Ha HA!
Two men? Two rioters and criminals.
Ty you Mr Lindell! SELF DEFENSE!!! Let’s get him off!!!!
Noice.
My Pillow is the best pillow.  Buy it today.
He was the suspect who shot at the mall
Right on, solid and groovy!!!!
Hero!
Thank God almighty he's FREE..!!!!
KYLE is what happens when the losers abdicate their responsibility to defend their citizens!
A murderer back out on the streets, walking with a fat guy who sells pillows and a crack addict.
I'm glad he got out. He didn't do anything wrong he was just defending himself
Good, the kid was defending himself. When he has his trial all of this will come out.
Funny but if he was a cop they would be losing there minds !
Good for them, the kid should've never been in jail in the first place.
🦸‍♂️
true american dream...though not attainable for the colored people
WELCOME HOME KYLE!
so if a black or latino man would do the same would he still be alive?
Wtf
after all, he was doing God's work right? GTFOOH.
The guy he killed had child molester case , this kid was just defending his self.
Self defense. Maybe rioters will now think twice, before trying to burn down private businesses.
Despicable
Crackheads
If anyone watches the full video of the incident, it is plain to see that Kyle Rittenhouse did his very best to avoid shooting anyone. Only when he was cornered and attacked did he SELF DEFEND himself. Kyle is a victim of the false narrative of the Main Stream Media.
Finally celebrities bailing out people who actually deserve it
DROP THE CHARGES!
The news can lie all they wants, people have seen the videos, the young man was running away and being hunted by a mob intent on killing him. He only shot when he had no choice, they were on him and he protected himself. The media has lost all credibility, the just lie and Americans do not trust any thing hey say.
Romans 12:19.
The teenager purposely armed went to look for trouble. And murdered. Is this America great?
guess I'm buying my pillow
Disgusting criminal.
He was defending himself and he'll be proven innocent eventually. I can't say the same for Hunter Biden.
There's the justice system created by humans... then there's a universal law. Good luck posting bail on that.
FREE KYLE!!!!
MADE IN THE USA!!!!!!!!!!!!
well... glad at least those jerks are going to forfeit $2 million.
that little punk needs to get locked up for life no parole
That's amazing, a true American I must be dreaming!!!!!!!
Obviously deranged...Life in a mental health facility seems appropriate!
I’m more glad than ever now that I didn’t buy that pillow.
Ironically ,that is the same pillow used to smother Epstein in his jail cell
Kyle rittenhouse... cleaning up the streets from pedophiles and felons.  A true American hero.  What a legend.
Great news!
The very reason he is the type to go out and shoot people, he is enabled by SICK PEOPLE
It was self defense. It’s on VIDEO😐🙄
Disgusting...absolutely disgusting.
bailed out by a crack addict🤣.
yay!
This is sickening Kyle Rittenhouse  murdered two people & they're posing w/him like White Supremacists posed w/George Zimmerman after he was found NOT GUILTY,  of harrasing, stalking & eventually murdering an UNARMED teenager Trayvon Martin🙏🏽

Boycott my pillow
The fibers that seem to fall off of the foam for mypillows is identified as being extremely toxic in the lab. Purple is also guilty of using that same open cell foam based chemical. Purple threw a giant NYC phonebook sized stack of lawsuit paperwork at a journalist who reviewed Purple's pillow fibres that were breaking free of the pillow and being breathed in by owners. The lawsuit didnt go anywhere, though it did go to show how creepy sociopathic greed is willing to go, and mypillow is cheered on by trumpstein the tax evading hushmoney grabbyhands gramps loudmouth sociopathic church mafia creeper, who also uses that scare em with a stack of lawyers lawsuit approach before backing off.
