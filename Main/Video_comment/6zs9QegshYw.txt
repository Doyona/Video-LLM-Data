No but on a serious note don't overflow people with compliments that would actually make them feel like they're stronger and they won't follow rules since people are way too kind to them
It’s a lesson for filling people’s buckets
you may be gross, but your better than the vegan teacher
Go hawks
So we spill?
Yours so handsome
Ohhh
That's good but if he does tick tock he's a tick tock teacher And he saw his videos so that's being kind he said you're just a amazing tik Tok Creator that's nice
So if I’m kind to people, they piss?  COOL :)
So if you're too nice to somebody they'll pee their pants
NO MY BLOOD
Your brother Peet would love to see you again and this in person!
I would fail at this tbh
A life lesson.
i thought he was finna say, “now say mean things” pour out the water and then say “now say sorry” “is the bucket full again?” “this is why you don’t bully!”
Why are you short?
Your family is so cute😂 and sometimes funny
We did this is our class room too! Your teacher made us say nice things to a bucket :)
so when were kind we lose happiness??? guess im gonna keep being an asshole
Im not a boy or a gorl 😭

LITTLE PEOPLE ROCK
Oh...um the takeaway i got was _"don't be too generous with compliments or the person will get a big head and become a mess, instead of humble"_
Your a great dude and not to be rude but either I don’t understand or this makes no sense
You are cool
Sorry I’m late but for people who don’t understand the bucket got filled up so much it spread it’s kind ness
Student uhmmm ugly fat short teacher:I SAID KIND WORDS!

"Ur such a good ticktocke".     *Ok"🍌🍌
This is good
This video made me regurgitate my last 14 meals. I also went into labor and gave birth to 5 children and all of them died. My husband then died on a car crash and my kids all of had seizures and died. Then my house was bombed and I was forced to live on the donuts in the dumpster behind Dunkin’ Donuts and street rain water.
what a good kid
Kid:"Your such an amazing tiktok creator Teacher: OK *Mind* how does he know imma tiktok creator

Kindness at best great vid

Wow, kindness makes people spit. Never knew.
Idc about school
When ask the class to say stuff about the thing but not about you✅
I wish this was true because if it was we would have a lot less mental health problems due to things like anxiety, if everyone was nice to someone with anxiety maybe they would forget about the anxiety and do the same thing that everyone helped them with(Bad English sorry)

He means the kindness spills out your bucket which gives other people the kindness that fell out of his bucket

You guys are cool
How about a tall glass, and each time somebody says something nice, you add in exactly a drop, and if the glass isn't full or overflowing at the end of the year, you would start over, and if it was, you'd add another tall glass, up until there's enough to fill a bucket, and you could award the class very greatly?
I love your videos and   thair so amazing
Nis
That fills my bucket:)
😁
Horodle tick toc
Only the people in this video
I hate the short people right now

Bucket is person. Water is kindness. When it overflows, it makes other people give kind comments

I don’t get this one
Wowww

He did not want them to know he was a tik tok creator
Can we just appreciate how these shorts make our day so much better💕.
Um     Your racist?
Omg ur a dwarf lol
I thought he was gonna say “ This is what happens with to much kindness “
And this is such a great lesson to people but you should be kind of people so their water overflows….
Short lol
I didint know the bucket was a tik tok creator and a teacher
Hi
I don't get it
I’m reading the comments and finding out how dumb I am bc I thought it was “ if your not kind you get constipated”
that bucket was so happy it started to loose blood
Ayo😳 that last part though
You are so nice
What
I used to wonder what does he mean but he’s actually means that you need to be kind and stop buttering people up
He WAS SO HAPPY
I love how that picturing it him and not just a random person
Anybody else don’t get it
rock in roll
What kind of words
Can you make a TikTok we’re we see your actual students?
Hi
So my blood overflows and I puke blood?
To make them wet?
They spill of happiness
He spilling water
SEAHAWKS
That literally ment nothing lmao
😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯😯
Iam not trying to bully you but This is why we need to be kind to each other  Student: so the person we kind with piss themselves?
wait I thought it was gonna be something about filling a bucket but he overflowed we were being kind to him and he overflowed where we stressing him?
Aaawww that was wholesomr
So that spill means that we get wet from peeing in our pants or what
*helou
You will get 100 million sub
this can either mean spreading kindness or cockiness
They are kind-
Ur son is peet montzingo right
What?😂sooooooooo funny 😆
I thought this was a lesson on ego at first lmao
Stupid to me to do it myself but it was a lot more fun and it would of course make it a bit easier to do that with you guys if ya is not a problem for you and if so how do you know if I have the correct email or password for my son and stupid phone number for the new phone
But thay are kind soulndt the bukket only fill Upp if they say mean thing or is there something im missing.
Being an amazing tick tocker is also like being an intelligent cadaver.
I hope you teach this to your students I wish I was in your class
See I think what he was trying to say is that when we are kind to eachother we can replenish our body with the fluids that we need! So much fluids that we overflow & it helps is become one with nature. The government is trynna separate us buy this guy is holding us down, truly sticking it to the man.
Ur a short version of ur brother
Kindness spreads
😡😡😡
Wait wha
Him: Positivity can fill up and overflow which is why we need to be kind     Me: *K I N D N E S S  M A K E S  Y O U  C U M*
Moral of the story: Don’t be too nice to people, they can only handle so much
So spill water??? ok
Rock the teacher bcs shes cute and your  tiktok is 1m
Be kind so people will bleed out
All of this are ture
Meanwhile I knoe that he was just telling himself nice things
But they were nice -_-
The eagles suck

No
Peet said that your not his brother
I am so confused right now
You are super funny xD
I have a baby Yoda puppet it's just that it's white and blue
Great example
I don’t get this they were being kind
Just because you are small doesn't mean you aren't special to the world
"this is why you need to be kind to each other" My god complex, aka Posiden:....HA-
:)
I think of something very questionable when the bucket... Got wet
Nace

When you compliment someone so much they die from happiness
Did u actually do that in ur real class tho?

So a cup gets full of water
O-0 the more I think about the way it "spilled"
Sea hawk
😶‍🌫️
WTF
You fill up the cup it overflows  You’re to nice to someone they get a huge ego And that’s why people need humility
He’s so amazing
Hes the greatest teacher ever
I like your cut G
I like your haircut
I love this guy so much, he’s so funny and he’s so underrated
Im 4"5
So we overflow and die
My teacher did this kind of thing with Apple's last week
OH SO TALL PEOPLE SUCK
So we will spill if we be kind? I don’t get it
Haha good
Another thing: even after the bucket is emptied (as in the day is over) the bucket is still wet with some drops of it (the compliment’s effects still last)
Are you actually a teacher
Don’t be to kind or the people will get spoiled
I like your outfit
Can u explain .....?
But don’t make someone too happy that they make the city flood.
Be kind so we… waste water?
So we piss are pants
Kindness will make people drown cause they can't get away from you while your complimenting them.
Little people are amazinf
I'm  Carl
I also overflow with liquids when people compliment me.
🤔
Is he related to Pete?
The Hog Rider is a fast ground troop with medium hitpoints, low damage, and the ability to jump over enemy Walls. He is unlocked at level 2 Dark Barracks. The Hog Rider (person) is a bare-chested dark-skinned man holding a hammer. He has a mohawk, wears a brown leather loincloth, a red belt, and a pair of leather sandals, as well as two large golden wristbands and a gold earring. His ride is a large hog, about half his height. It has a brown leather bridle looped around its tusks, which in turn is held by the Hog Rider. Hog Riders prioritize defensive structures above all other targets, and will bypass all other types of enemy buildings and troops while any defenses remain on the battlefield. This is true even if they are under attack by enemy Clan Castle troops, heroes or Skeleton Trap skeletons. Note that like all troops that prioritize defenses, Hog Riders do not consider the Clan Castle to be a defense regardless of whether or not it contains enemy troops, but do consider the defending Grand Warden and the activated Town Hall weapon (if any) to be defensive buildings.  Once all defenses are destroyed, Hog Riders become like any other troop with no preferred target; they will attack the nearest building to them regardless of type, and will turn and attack enemy units if they become aware of any nearby.He can be used to jump over any level Walls, rendering them ineffective against Hog Riders. Note that while this allows Hog Riders free access to what lies behind the Walls, it does not open up gaps for other troops to move through. If the Hog Riders need the support of other ground troops, you will still need to deploy Wall Breakers, a Jump Spell, or Earthquake Spells in order to assist them. Hog Riders can be used en masse, i.e. a "Hog Rider Rush", without requiring any Wall Breakers to break Walls. However, such a strategy can be costly in terms of Dark Elixir, and sports weaknesses against defending Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps, a problem which only becomes more prominent at higher levels. At Town Hall 10 and above, Hog Riders can be combined with Miners in a strategy known as Hog Miner or Hybrid. Both troops are able to bypass Walls innately, but Miners do not have a preferential target, allowing them to cover for Hog Riders by dealing with defending Heroes and Skeleton Traps. The combination also has weaknesses against flying Clan Castle troops, as neither are able to target air. At lower levels, Hog Riders are quite capable of acting as distracting troops like Giants; they have nearly as much health as a similar-level Giant, move twice as fast, and do considerably more damage. They work well with the Healing Spell when you group several of them together. A good tactic for using Healing Spells is to place them strategically on a cluster of defenses (at least about 3 or more) and also deploy them shortly before the Hog Riders arrive in the area, i.e. deploy them ahead of the Hog Riders. This is so that the Hog Riders get the most out of the Healing Spell, and destroy the defenses without losing too much HP. Spots where Giant Bombs or Bomb Towers are/may be should be given special attention when deploying Healing Spells. Hogs of the same level as the Giant Bomb will survive a single Giant Bomb, but they're helpless against a pair of Giant Bombs even with a Healing Spell. Heal them after they've gone through a Giant Bomb blast. The Hog Rider is one of the best troop types for drawing out Clan Castle troops, as it can avoid Walls to penetrate deep enough to reach centrally-placed Clan Castles (and enough health to not die before it gets there). Deploy one or a few to trigger the Clan Castle troops, then lure the reinforcement troops to the corner side, and deploy multiple Archers or Wizards to slaughter them, and then deploy the remainder of your Hog Riders. This strategy is especially effective during Clan War raids. However, Skeletons from the Skeleton Trap and Heroes can also easily kill the Hog Riders, as they can only target defenses, so make sure to have some troops that target anything, such as Wizards, which can swipe out the Skeletons. Hog Riders don't target air so flying Clan Castle troops, especially Dragons, can be a big threat. Most mass Hog Rider strategies in Clan Wars require that the Clan Castle troops be killed first by luring. Bring other troops in addition to Hog Riders, such as Wizards, to deal with enemy Clan Castle troops and clean up the base. Poison Spells can be used to kill almost any enemy Clan Castle troop, but beware as the troops will attempt to flee the poison. If the Poison Spells are decently leveled, and you effectively keep the Clan Castle troops from escaping the Poison Spell with distracting troops, they can eliminate almost any troop. They can also be used to dispense of those pesky Skeletons risen from the Skeleton Traps. Time is also a factor to consider. With only 3 minutes in an attack, it is essential to make sure that this whole process and the remainder of the attack is done as quickly as possible to avoid running out of time. Defensive  Defending against Hog Riders is tricky, as their ability to bypass Walls renders them irrelevant. However, the fact that they can jump over Walls and attack defenses means that they may leave behind their ground support (such as Barbarians, etc.), as they will not be able to follow. This will allow your interior defenses to concentrate on the Hog Riders. Another way to defend against Hog Riders is to exploit the fact that they will attack the closest defensive building. You can arrange your base in such a way so that you have high-powered defenses on the inside and lower-powered defense on the outside, with a layer of resources in between. That way, the Hogs will (in theory) complete a loop around your base before being able to attack your interior defenses (Inferno Towers, X-Bows, etc.), by which time they should have all been killed by the interior defenses. You can place Spring Traps in between defensive buildings to take out a few Hog Riders at a time; good usage of multiple Spring Traps can severely hinder a Hog Rider rush. Hog Riders can be easily killed using "forced pathing". Forced pathing is a strategy that manipulates the Hog Rider AI and makes them go to at least 2 defenses that cannot be prevented by surgical dropping or side clearing. Placing a set of Giant Bombs in between the two can most certainly hinder the attacker progress. They would not be able to heal the Hog Riders in time. Clan Castle troops, Heroes, and Skeleton Traps set to Ground Mode can be an annoyance to mass Hog Rider raids, as Hog Riders will not attack them unless all defenses have been destroyed. Make sure to centralize them if you want to beat Hog Riders. In Clan Wars, Dragons are excellent troops to place in Clan Castles against Hog Riders, especially for Town Halls 8 and 9. They have high HP, meaning they won't die easily and can kill mass quantities of Hog Riders swiftly if not properly lured. Most mass Hog Rider strategies require that the enemy Clan Castle troops be killed first, so if the attacker lures out a Dragon, but fails to kill it, then a 3-star win is next to impossible, much less a 1-star win via destroying 50% of the buildings. Multi-target Inferno Towers can be a severe hindrance to Hog Riders, having high HP to take several hits from Hog Riders, while hitting large groups of them. Although the Hog Rider is certainly not a liability on defense, the fact that all defensive troops are unimpeded by Walls negates the primary advantage of the Hog Rider. Still, for the space they take they are faster and more damaging compared to Giants.The Hog Rider undergoes significant visual changes at levels 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Initially, the Hog Rider is a dark-skinned man with a black mohawk and beard. He also has a gold earring in his right ear and sports two heavy golden wristbands, a red belt, and a brown loincloth. The Hog Rider's hammer has two brass bands. At level 3, his hammer increases in size and turns black. The brass bands on the hammer's head disappear, and the hammerhead goes further down onto the stick, creating a button looking object on the top of the hammerhead. At level 5, his mohawk turns from black to orange, making it similar to that of a level 5 Goblin. At level 6, his hammer gains three large, golden spikes and a bronze plating. At level 7, the edges of his hammer start to glow red, and he gains a brown headband but reverts to a black mohawk. At level 8, his hammer is now mostly golden. His hog also gains a headband. At level 9, the gold on his hammer is much thicker. His headband also lightens in color. At level 10, his hammer turns a bright light blue color that resembles the look of ice. This matches the theme of Town Hall 13. It also gains a small same-colored glow. At level 11, his hammer turns a light greenish color. This matches the theme of Town Hall 14. His hog gains gold armour on its face and muzzle.
We are kind so our friends pee their pants?
Kindness so you leak blood
Your just like my teacher 👨‍🏫
Did anybody else notice his vampire teeth or no wolf teeth  I like it
Water over spills: Child:😲 it spilled! Me: okay I know you're a kid but come on what the fuck do you think was going to happen?
I learned about the kindness buckets when I was in 2nd grade. I loved the way that I feel when I get compliments, so I figured other people like it too.
"This is why we need to be kind to eachover" what, so we piss ourselves?
We learned about even and odd numbers it was very easy like a 2 grade work and we made valentines bag and happy valentines to you and have a awsome day -Viliame
i will be nice to solve the issue of the world not having clean water and people will no longer die of dehydration
People will pee their pants?
Shoutout to you I love your tiktok
So you want our head to explode
What wtf
As my counselor mr petty would say be a bucket filler but a bucket dipper
Kindness makes you piss yourself 😍😍
You are cool
i thought he was trying to explain that if everyone was kind too you and you weren’t kind back to anyone you would become too full of yourself and there would be repercussions. 😅
I too like making People wet when im nice to them
I like the way you color
nice shirt and stool
I want to see you actually teach a class of actual student
All facts
Okay I would be about 1%/100%
Omg it the best I love u and ur the best look u deserve like 10 billion on every vid
Being kind makes people wet
I love your content it's so good
All those thing are true
.
This guy is so awesome
OH I GET IT! The bucket is a person and the water is kindness! So when somebody is kind enough to the person the person throws up on them.
Being to kind can make use you
So someone can only get so many compliments or else it just spills out of the bucket and does nothing
I love your videos so much
Weee looovveee ur vids
Such a good message! We need people like you in this world inspiring people to be positive!
That's not a bucket, that's a mug
No
Dwarfs are funny is the best way possible and they're all a lot more kind
I NEED YOU TO BE MY TEACHER 😭😭
This got weird and I don't know why
this guy is amazing
No
They did
I get it it means kindness spreads
Actually... i replayed the video and i get it now.
Not to be rude or anything but what is that supposed to mean
Be kind so we can spill our liquids out 🥰😚
We need people to pee more I guess
This doesn’t make sense
water spilling is usually a bad thing, he needs to be more specific
Oooookay, this made absolutely no sense 😕
I love this dude so funny
:)
i dont get it teach, can you reapet that?
If we make people happy they pee out of excitement
imagine being so happy you get eroused and spill everywhere
Hi am lord farquaad
Everything I said is true about u
So that we can blownup
Are your teeth fake teeth on the top
So we overflow with happiness
It overfills them with joy! 😁
Son of a biscuit that was kind words
*when your students know your user in Tik tok..*
Is your son named peet montzingo
Kindness makes people spill
Your not a good tik tok creater
So we can pee our pants?  I think I missed the point
You can use the same thing for stress
I LOVE the Seahawks!
Negative comments are positive
Thats what they did wtheck
For the people who didn't understand: When people said kind things to him, he filled with positivity. When more kind words were told, the kindness spills representing him giving it to others.
😁😁😁😁😁😁😎😎😎😎🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
I like the way you smile 😏 other people be like🙄
Gay
This guy is from Washington
Kindness can give people bladder control problems. What a awesome guy!
Huh
Love the Seahawks merch
Oh lord
Man is secretly teaching us without us even knowing
I wish he was my teacher back then.
This is trash 🗑️🗑️😂
I love overflowing whenever I get compliments
You are so kind you are my favorite YouTube you’re better than Pete
You can't always be to kind because people with take advantage of that so I always say kind but not to kind
He is so awkward when he says “okayyy” when he is complimented. This shows how humble he is! Thank you for the content you create!
???????????????????????
When you need some confidence
What grade do you teach?
Yea think again buddy …  If they had given you a couple negative comments,you probably wouldn’t have to mop the floor right now. . .
As far as I remember, if you pour to much water on paper, it becomes soggy, fragile, and it breaks down. So uhm. Maybe don’t be nice..?
So the lesson is that we need to be kind to people so they pee there pants
Do negative comments
So if I’m kind to other people they will pee their pants?
Of your teaching about kindness why your harassing peet montzingo
Again every time I get up I go on tik   tok and every time this shows up omg.
Bro you are the best and don't let anyone   say that you are small
thats amazing that is really nice people who hate on ur vids need to watch this
Have a nice day
Plus I’m only in second grade
I don’t get this video saying nice things I really don’t get it anybody agree because if it’s a lesson on hating people then why they say nice things duh
Because kindness makes a mess? JK, because it spreads.
Ya know sometimes, I think they say these to you not the bucket.
I like when you are nice and kind and helpful to your students
I love it
That made no fucking sense
TW: MAJOR GORE       For some reason, I thought “oh. So you need to be kind to each other so you begin bleeding through your mouth? Blood pours of of your nose and ears? That’s why? Makes sense enough.” I’m sorry 💀
269k
We did this school but with paper buckets that everyone had on a bulletin board! There was a little basket of “droplets” that you could write complements on and put it in their bucket! At the end of the week everyone would get their droplets and go home so happy for the weekend! I still remember it & the book the concept was based off of
Gotta overflow with compliments
Filly good
What grade do you teach
Your such an amazing tiktok creator! *over flows the cup on purpose*
People rock
“It spilled” 😂😂
You ar an gold guy
😵😵😵😵
Thank you for spreading kindness and teaching kids to be there best
OK
I don't get it are you apost to say nice things or not nice things
TIK TOK CREATOR???????
Holly molly

So the lesson is be nice and they will piss them self

I did this already I is a good one this to me is sel search it up
If you act kind to it, it will overflow and give kindness back! I finally get it now
You a very much motivated me
Yes because kindness spreads
Yukb😱😂🤣
cool and good job
They were just holding back the “YOUR SUCH A SMALL DWARF🤣🤣🤣”
Although, be weary of cults trying to overload you with comments to basically become one of them  But still, it's a good lesson to teach
It not mistake it a masterpiece
So people piss themselves?
His he a teacher
Too much positivity he excreted sperm
You are funny
Your so cool! I wish u were my  teacher!!!
Good lessen bro
Beautiful lesson
The second and first was the why not bully in reverse

Ahh yes because I want to spill
:)
But…. But…. That’s not the lesson…. He stole it and that’s not what it’s even supposed to mean😂
Omg you the best I'm love you tiktiok and yt
How can you not love this guy
Omg
Teacher: say positive thing to the bucket                                                   me: you have COVID
Good lessons
This doesn’t make any sense
The water spilled. I don’t get it
That doesn’t make sense they were being nice
Seahawks more like seacocks
👍🏻
So ur saying if ur kind to people they die?
I don’t get it
that one kid in the class: but if we fill his cup with too much water he will die
GO HAWKS💚💙
Lol
spill my bucket guys
You are nice\fun/cool/and awesome with you are a man!
I can agree to this because when I go to school I get bullied a lot at school and I come home and cry so much I can barely see
So we wet ourselves?
Awesome Video☺️ Also GO SEAHAWKS!!!
Jags
🥺
Go   Seahawks
Go Halks!!
Too much love will kill you they say
ERRR
Yea make everyone u see wet by filling up there bucket ….oh shi
say positive things to the bucket.  says positive things*  what happened?  It overflowed   This is why being nice will drown a human being
THERE WHERE KIND
We need to be nice to each other so we can spill??!
I really want to be in your school and get in your class room bc your so nice and I love your videos
this isn't good because some people might misinterpret it because if you give someone to many compliments it will over flow and make a mess that messes aren't good i rest my case
Wat u need to be kind so others piss theirselves
Even tho you’re a Seahawks fan you’re nice so we forgive you
The water represents “kindness”  And the bucket is the “person”. So when the water overflows he’s saying When someone receives enough kindness(full) they too project that kindness to others(spilling)
Alternate title “narcissism”
Ok so if i get too many compliments i piss myself
To bad he’s a Seahawks fan
Hey Mr.montzingo what will we be having for homework tomorrow?
What everybody was saying nice things
Moral of the story: Be nice to people so you can pour water in them.
I thought when he spilt the water that meant if your to nice you just get annoying 😂
Basically what it's saying is if you're kind to someone there kindness will spill out to others and others will be happy be kind be happy :)
Embrace the ✨meow meow✨
Ngl I thought he was trying to boost his ego at first😂😂😂
To be honest though I’m a child and I still think this is a great way to learn
Wgat the
Ok so we need make others spill blood
You are a really cool teacher
Now,cup is not empty
Hehe
Ur video r gud
Or drugs
Love your lessons Mr.Montzingo they teach me to be a better person.❤ thank you.
Ok i like little people because they are sooo cute and subscribe
Ohhhhhh when you are shunned with kindest after a certain extent you inadvertently start being nice to other people continuing the cycle
“I like the way you smile” the way he said is just awsome
I love pissing my self
As someone who doesnt like their family and has anger & overstimulation issues, so I end up becoming overwhelmed with happiness whenever something good happens, this is entirely true and I try to give as many compliments as I can to people, regardless if they think Im weird or not. It genuinely makes their day better, and doing random acts of kindness or being just really sweet in general gives people a really good feeling.
My bus they like 6 people bully me when i   am on the bus
Seahawks all day my boi
I intouduce you one of the first teacher’s that makes lesson understandable and fun.
Why is he so small like Elementary Woodlands when the coaches are really small like that side of that human?
This is what I thought 💭 lol
Bro i wish you were my teacher
Because if you be kind your insides will spill out 😁
so the life lesson is if your too nice you’ll spill someone’s water
1M
These are the types of videos my 5th grade teacher should of shown us 😆😆. Amsome work
Be kind so you Pee your self
👁         👁        👃🏼        👄
It’s not a mistake it’s a masterpeice
Or if you say negative things eventually the person will overflow and explode and that's why we need to be kind to each other
I actually don't get this one
This is a cool way to teach kids to be kind to each other
To the people who don’t get it, he spilled it to demonstrate the “person” being kind to other
I don’t get it-? 🤔
I dont get it
Yes, be kind so they start peeing :D
I learned that you have to be so kind that you make everyone around you cream their pants got it.
Your brother and sister are so cool AND SO ARE YOU
go seahawks
Heh the little people rock
I didn’t understand what he ment at the end but now I do
But it spilled isn’t that bad?
Ur videos make me smile man, my friend who was a small person, he killed himself. He did this due to a large amount of people bullying him for being different. I miss him to this day.
That is so nice that you are teaching people to be kind😀😀😀
Ohhhh I get it now

Your tiktoks better than ur brothers 😂
i dont under stand this video
My response was just: So we can all blow up!
This is an amazing lesson.
At the end when he says this is why to be kind to each otherit's because unlike if you someone tells you to say mean things to something and you want to do because it's a test they don't actually want you to do it did just to see the kindness and brightness
Your cool like me
Very good lesson
This teacher is the best in the world
But you literally just made them say do kindness to the bucket but now you're saying that they didn't
The first kid holding a baby yoda pop-it did say something true🥳

This is why we shouldn't be kind to each other
I said the chicken
Best shirt in the world
Make no sense
Ok, with the bullying one, I understood. With this one, I’m completely lost. Can someone explain this one to me?
This teacher honestly just try’s to make people day better and he actually does 🐌❤️
That amazing thats why you should keep up to 1M subs!
Ayo😳
I just saw the Seahawks stool  I am very grateful to have you in my state Mr. M 🤣
So we need to tell people positive things so they cry
I don’t want my blood to spill out of my head when someone makes a noise that humans understand as “words” that come off as kind! AHHHHHHH!
Mistake is a masterpiece
You make our days and make us smile <3
Peet’s brother
I can easily turn this around   Compliment your peers to overflow their ego so they end up destroying themselves  It's about the long game
You are not sus
Little people rock
The kindness made Timmy wet
Not if you cut the paper and crumble it it will never get its old shape back
I'm sorry teacher but I genuinely don't understand the meaning of that spilled water...
This was lame af....like i ain't even get the end point like bru i would say stick to teaching but shiiii I couldnt even understand a simple metaphor
No it overflowed which means you made someone overconfident 😂
Ok...
I love the  Montzingo Family Your Brother Peet Is Hilarious and your inspirational and your sister is so Kind and Your Daughters are just So  Cute and adorable the way she is kind with her words and how she ask for things so polite😆😁❤❤❤🥺
Exact opposite, just talking to me when I'm in the exetensail crisis feel just don't talk to me unless you want to be apart of my crisis
I wish he was my teacher and tanjiro and inosuke and nezuko
Too easy
Be kind... it get them wet  On a serious note, my guys a good teacher
We be kind so the kindness spreads back to us. I think that's the lesson.
He got so many positive comments that he couldn't hold all of it and it spilled
This made no fucking sense
So your saying.. if I be super kind to someone, they pee themselves. I need to test this out
"it's not a mistake,🌃 ITS A MASTERPIECE🌃
Whats so special about you? Nothing, i dont see you as something special. You are just a generic guy giving advice. Nothing more

#sehawks
The fuck this is pointless
Love all the Seahawks stuff go hawks I miss Washington
I thought it was gonna be negativity is a necessary thing....
😐🙂When I go off I'm just lying in my bed watching TikTok's and see this and I smile comes on my face

What?
I LOVE WENDYS BECAUSE MCDONALDS ICECREAM MACH I NE IS BAD

Tiny man
All I learned was kindness can make people too overwhelmed and happy.

That’s a clever idea
This is what we should be nice to people to make people happy and change and be better
You're GOOD
🤭
Cool 😎
Seahawks let's go
O
So we can overflow each other with liquids
Wow, this inspired me to say sorry to the ones I called ugly, this is why I must start watching more of these 😊😊
Got the Seahawks shirt!!!
I love my seld
small people are bad
Wow this gnome needs to tell himself act of kindness cuz no one would normally
Fun Fact: if you get compliments, water will spill out of your body
Lesson for today: being kind to someone results in them having to clean up water from the floor.
Yeah be kind so water can come out all our heads 😌
This is honestly such a great lesson for kids
Breh
It's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
Ow
Ever said that’s a really good lesson you should teach kids kind as well make a chroma board paper new again
Wait i know that name are you peters dad? Wewwwww
So i could make my mortal enemies drip blood as they overflow causing them to die? Amazing advice!
Your heavy
So I piss myself when I get a compliment no thank you I'm good being in a corner and . OBSERVING
So we waste valuable kindness?
“It’s not a mistake”, ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
Your peets brother
that's good
Are you Pete’s brother?
The bucket is filled with happiness
Hi god bless have a good one
Spill the kindness
I love Mr.Montzingo
Can we all respect the fact that this man is wearing a Seahawk shirt, like- LETS GOO🏉🏉
It took me a second to get cause I'm slow, but if someone out there didn't get it, the water spilled out of the cup, and the water is the kindness. The kindness isn't going inside the cup anymore, it's going outwards from the cup :>
i swear a had a much similar teacher tell me this in elementary
I just realized that this is Peets brother
That one lesson felt more meaningful than my 8th grade schoolwork
Oh, i get it! When it spilled, it spread, so its spreading the kindness it had!
My favorite team is Seahawks how about you
Can someone explain please?
ITS UGLY IS WHAT IM SAYING
Kind to each other just not ourselves hehehe what I go by
We leak with joy?
make people happier and happier until they piss themselves
:)
I thought he was showing narccissism
I need this guy to be my college teacher
WAIT SO J CAN PEE MT SELF O//O

I'm confused that is stupid asf
I love the sea hawks
I want you to be my teacher so badly
Isn’t the kind though
Now I don’t understand this one
Wow that is amazing I love it
All kids should be kind and that’s a good lesson
I just wanna know If that’s a men’s small or child extra large
That was kinda cringe
I'm pretty sure you need a bigger bucket
It is not a mistake ✨ IT IS A MASTER PIECE ✨

I hope u read this ur an awesome  teacher keep it up the world will not be the same with out u
So we pee oneself
Too much kindness can be overwhelming
but the paper would never be the same, damage cannot be undone and the capacity of the cup had lowered. the cup starts to crack and fill with leaks.     I want to push him over and watch him struggle to get up with his tiny arms.
Spilling usually isn’t a good thing though
Little people rock
This is just a man tooting his own trumpet. He’s just complimenting himself. I’m sure if any other person showed a video of them in a mirror telling themselves how good of a sport player they are or how smart they are. It’s good for self esteem but don’t let it get outta hand
This video really went over my head 😑
The water represents the happiness that you give to the person and when it spills it’s overflowed with joy. That’s my guess
It's not a mistake,✨ it's a masterpiece ✨
Be nice to pepole toke them wet 🙏
I like how they always assume its you
I don’t get it
Ye it makes u have to much blood and u explode 👍
Yes let’s be so kind to each other we piss out of our heads
Your  amazing 🤩
Bruh why are u teaching ur kids this cause if ur kind u won’t know what to do in a fight seen it for myself  but good lesson I guess
Don't understand
Haha short

Migit

Seahawks are bad
I don’t get it-  Ik I’m stupid but pls explain it to me 😭

Cup:*spills* Conclusion: Be kind
Wait so we need to be nice so that we all explode lol😂? That’s what I got from this 😂

Life lesson
Or our water bucket will spill?
What year do you teach
Who else loves watching shorts all day long

Love it
Be so kind to people it spills there blood
There’s a hole in my bucket
So let me get this straight, we need to be kind to each other so that random water can spill out of a random bucket??
Yea little people are cute
Oh, now I get it kindness makes people piss themselves! Thank for teaching me!
I love your vids but I’m really young and I Evan thought it was awesome
Are you peets brother?
Him: This is why we need to be kind  Me:… so I can spill?
wdym it spilled
Udheh
So if people are kind to me I wet myself?
Bro he just taught friendship and kindness way better than two schools My elementary school and my middle school
I mean at least you’re telling the truth you know
I like the raiders
GOO SEAHAWKS!!!!!!
Wait what. Makes no sense
I Love your Tik tok  videos❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Mr. Montzingo can you please explain the analogy here I am confused
900
Kindness makes people wet themselves, good lesson
Awwwwwww your so amazing I would love to have a teacher like you ♥️
I don't get this one.
Ever heard of too much kindness
GARBAGE ALWAYS BE MEAN
Aww and the one on bullying was super good to
It was overflowed with happiness UwU
It spilled and made a mess and now you helped create a narcissist.    Sincerely the Realist
I wish I could be in your class.you are like my cool dad you are so chill
I don't get it
We need to be king so we spill pee! 🥺🥺
Get right with the lord Jesus Christ before it’s too late repent and put ur faith in Christ. Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins and risen on the third day he’s the only way to salvation John 14:6 John 3:36 John 3:16 Romans 10:9..
Your so amazing I would commit arson and war crimes!!
Two easy
One we did this at my school! We would call it “filling someone’s bucket” by saying a nice thing, it would fill somones bucket. By saying somthing mean, you would empty a bucket. We called bully’s “ bucket stealers” and I feel like it’s a great message to send kids
Why do they being kind but why do you say that’s worry that’s why we kind
If we become kind to someone we make them PEE AMAZING IM BEING NICE NOW YESSSSSS
So ur saying I'll piss myself if I get enough compliments?
Wouldnt this lesson teach kids the opposite ?! Being rude keeps the floor dry and stops you from wetting yourself ?
Cringe but mad cool 😎
So they can overflow with happiness
I don’t get it can someone explain to me what this video means
It doesn’t matter if your short which your not. But yes we have to be kind
You have mu subscription.
I don’t get it…
Being kind makes people moist? Noted.
This was great
Tears of joy
The same thing can be a metaphor for a lot of things too
Yeh thats right  If ur kind to someone they pee on the classroom floor 😎
Ok so I thought it was gonna be u spilling it after with little drips still in there and u say, “this is why we are nice, it stays with us for a long time no matter what and improves our lives”
Your the best
Too easy
Yay
If your to Nice his brain will over floaw
I’ll stop it from spilled in one sentence “the Seahawks suck”
I am so fucking confused  We need to be kind so that we can all blow up and overfill?????
Abc's JJ4H4HH5H5UU5YY5U5
My guy posted bangers
I'm confused?
I didn't get this one?
Wait- what's kindness to friends. WHAT IS KINDNESS?! T^T But the video is the best thing I've seen keep up the great work
But they did say kind things
The kid should have said "there is more volume of water so it takes hight, unlike u " this is a joke not trying to be mean
Makes no sense
Is this also saying people can have to much happiness
are you pete montzingo’s dad?
But they were nice or are they just being sarcastic
Why
Give me your roblox name and password cuz I go to give me free Robux :)
We need to be kind to each other so we can spill water

Yeah it's like vitamins if you get too much vitamin A you die and if you don't get too much you die this but if you have enough of everything you live so happiness is not always the key to everything

Self absorbed much
I hope this guy teaches kindergarten cause he could call in sick and still go
So when we get happy we pee on ourselves?
That way I'll do to be kind to each other so we can all cry a lot of tears

Did this in 2nd grade, really changed my perspective glad it did      Now I trash talk kids in cod and beat up kids for no reason
He need to be nice to people so they spill?
I found you and your sus
I think the lesson is that ppl overflow with joy (being water) that they share with others creating a loop
To much kindness and you start to bleed out🥰
Because being kind makes people wet?
I’m sorry but I gotta say the Seahawks stink
So that I spill all over the floor? Thats weird
OMG I GET IT WE HAVE TO SPILL PEOPLE😁
I feel like this more shows that being kind too kind to someone can bother them and make them overflow and lose some of the kindness you gave them well also making a mess
Your cool

Be kind se we spill
I hate my life
And I *WILL* say this again bc im kind :) I support the Dwarf ppl with the disease. I also thing Dwarfs rock. I support them no matter what!  ヾ(๑╹◡╹)ﾉ"

In fact you should be.
You'd make a great counselor!
His class kick his as all the time I bet
I thought he was gonna say "we shouldn't be full of ourselves"
I love spilling water on the floor when I’m happy 😫
We need to be king so each others blood can spill out
We need to be more kind to eachother  Why so we pee ourselves
I don’t get it does it mean you can’t been very kind
I love the education on positivity.
I too overflow with fluids when in people's presence
I want to be small so I can be a tiny tank and be in vents hiding in hide and seek
It's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
Great Britain and am a banana
I like it
Iam confused
Wait what but.... Huh???
A perfect lesson
I think he meant its full of happines
If people dont understand its that the cup fills up with joy and spread it

If You don't understand then your not trying hard enough in life
So that means he ejaculated?
I love when you are happy
It's so cool to learn it that way omg! I learned that keeping things in has a similar effect a bottle that was filled with water and keeps filling until it comes out.
I've only watched a few of these and I would have loved to have him as a teacher 😭😭
Then put other cups below that one when it over flows
Ok he is a good teacher but the Seahawks naw I am just kidding
"Alright Boys and girls" There were no Girls :/
Not sure what that meant, if we get enough positive comments our bodily fluids spill?
Stop the cap no hate tho
🙂
Wait, what?
I don’t get it
Yes, always be kind to others so that they spill.
Yeah we gotta make eachother BUST A nut quite frequently, then world hunger and everything will be solved😌✨
What color is a carrot
So you're saying kindness can make people piss themselves? Got it
I like you
So we can spill
Wow I wish people were that nice to me
"this is why you should be kind to people" because someone can only be so happy?
Ur smile is good tho
Amazing lesson

https://youtube.com/shorts/ZomBWlpZht8?feature=share  Isn't this you bro  If my name is not prince then I am a bot
Hi
I don’t get it? Isn’t it a bad thing to have it overflow? But if they are saying nice things then why is it turned becoming bad I’m confused?...
So they will cough up blood?
Youre a sea hawks fan lions all the way
We need to be kind so ppl piss themselves
Huh?????
To expose that Seahawks shirt (or any Seahawks gear for that matter) to kids is considered child abuse.!
Its not a mistake its a masterpiece
Don't wanna piss myself
I love this guy so much, he’s so funny and he’s so underrated
Pants
So u pee you're psnts
This makes no sense bro🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I DON’T GET IT
I was thinking you just be kind you also have to give constructive criticism so you don't get an ego cause if you get too many good complaints that might happen
But it makes a mess. And this explains sugar coating, be nice. But not too nice. Be real when you have to be.
Ur awesome
it's not a mistake ✨ IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
poor janitor
Its not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
This guy is great
This guy is like joe dalton but kind
Great guy
YES. SPILL THE BLOOD WITH KINDNESS
Boo
Haha
But now he's all full of himself      I'm Sorry
He got full of himself
I thought this was a lesson on giving too many compliments
Go Seahawks All day every day
Meep
We’re do you teach?
Why can’t all teachers teach like this 😁
All thing the say are lies
Why because it makes blood come out of our ears
Idk man i dont get what you're trying to say  Edit : i think its over joy
It’s not a mistake it’s a masterpiece
That made no sense
So if people are nice to me i pee?  PS it's a Joke and that Lesson was a very good one
i guess when people be positive to me. I start spiting up blood from now on.
Not really understanding this lesson
Go seahawks!
Be so kind you make people pee
That’s not a bucket..
Amazing
Love u
What grade do you teach? 😁 Also that's a great message
Kind so we can piss ourselves in front of everyone 🥰
This is what I got from this  When water spills, we should be nice to each other
This actually helped me because I was like a controlled  robot before and I needed a controller in order to move and  my mom is texting this but I’m saying it
So I should be pissing my pants everyday to make sure people are nice to me?
Him: I LikE tHe WaY yOU SMilE Gay
https://youtu.be/3tyOVnOXGxw
So you want people to pee on themselves gotcha
Idk if that taught to be kind or that made me realise that if your kind enough to someone they piss themselve like look at it spill but fr I love ur content bro
Some people cant be too kind or it'll be weird for the other person
I also overflow with liquids when people compliment me.
He is so amazing
i thought you were going to tell them to say one negative thing, then pour it all out to show how one negative comment can really ruin someones day
Bullying gets results -TheRussianBadger
I THINK HE CAME UP A LITTLE SHORT.. OMG! WHO SAID THAT???????????????????
Kindness can make people pee. I love this guys’d lessons.  Edit: first of all, what’s with the war in the replies? Second of all, I’ve had the spelling mistake for too long to fix it lol
This is a great lesson
it's not a mistake It's a masterpiece
There is no clear lesson here.
I like the way ya winked!
Hey u r amazing man
That blink was sus 😳
All those are you
Aww so cute 🥰
We need more active representation of real life things to easily understand everything like sitting down, cant talk, write and listening for 6-7 hours a day for 12 years give or take and then forgetting everything later on in life and WHAT HELL IS TAXES
I want this as my teacher hes cool
I wish I had a teacher like you
It's not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTER PIECE ✨
Seems like a good lesson, but I don't get it?
“This is why we need to be kinda to each other!”  me: so we can spill water on a classroom floor…?   I LOVE IT LOLLL
Guys can u say this in 1 letter each I C U P
Dude you're the best
Man this guy is short he's a baby
I love tiny people
This made me crack up
Be kind and waste water?
Self promotion be like   (I’m just joking I love your content keep working hard)
I think this is....actually a FANTASTIC way to put this.
If you too kind, people will leak.
So we can make them wet??
Oops I think he had an accident
I don’t mean this but I can imagine a kid saying “So we pee ourselves?!” 😂
I think you are trying to say that we can overflow with kindness and happiness and that's a good thing. But you didn't get it across, so it sounds like a bad thing. Love this
Because if your kind to another , they would pass themselves
So they get “wet”?🌊
We need to be kind cause a bucket will over fill I don’t get it
Always be kind to people so they start puking up blood and die
O
because at some point it would be a waste????? what of the message here??
This why i love this teacher he teaches his kids to be kind and my teacher always said u fill my bucket when we said something nice
He's like khaby lame, making the world better from one video to another
I thought he was about to say that we shouldn’t be too kind to each other lul
Kindness should be spread to everyone in this world.
Teachers should try to bond and have fun with students
Yo my water spilled
I get it, he was filled up with kindness the water spread, hence so did the kidnes
So that my body fluid spills out of me?
So if your to kind to people you make them spill
So the things I got from this is 1:be nice to people. And 2:if your nice to someone a giant is gonna pick them up and feel them with water
I like the video
You’re so smart
Huh? This was not it lol
The bucket look like it would be called sally the bucket
So your ego grows that's what the water represents right, I think I'm starting to get it
Lol I loved how they kept refering to the teacher rather than the stickman 😎
This the best teacher EVER
I mean he's a great tiktok creator
If where king it will make the person a mess
Man if only highschool was like this were someone isn't beat or high all the time
Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." Romans 10:9
Are you peer MadoingoBrother
I don’t understand it but I love all the comments lol 😂
You need a grom and go riding someday if you haven't already. It would be fun.
This is literally super basic but misses the point the paper thing missed the mark too.
What exactly did he teach nothing? How is spilling water mean we should be kind to each other? And what’s with that wink when he smiles like what?
Do u teach at a school in Clarksville Tennessee I’ve been there and realize the hoodie ur wearing
Small lessons for small people
Man’s increased kindness with a cup of water
Please show me I’m your biggest fan make sure to tell your daughter and your wife tell him that they’re super great person and I love them and I love you I’m your biggest fan
Made no sense......
Why do u like the Seahawks.
Es got a point
Dang that cup really has an ego.
I don’t get it
SO WE CAN MAKE PEOPLE SPILL
AYO😳
Ooohhhh so when you’re nice to people they overflow and die? Great tip! Thanks!
It's not a bucket it's a cup
“you’re ugly”  * throws bucket aggressively to the ceiling *  “now what happened to the water in the bucket?”  “it spilled?”  “this is why we need to be mean to eachother”
I dont wanna pee my self if i get kind words
The lesson is that don’t be happy or it will all spill and make a mess
Water spilled cuz that was the kindness overfilling the person
Jb your short doesnt mean you have to kiss peoples asses, as a saying not the literal sense though...
I don’t get it? Don’t compliment people because it overflows??
We have to be kind so they can overflow with Water
Ok but your smile is beautiful and you are amazing and such and amazing teacher!
I guess I'll be so overwhelmed by the flurry of compliments I'll just pee myself.

I have no idea what happened what does spilled water mean?
They were kind to it so how did it get upset tf?
So if I be kind to another person, their guts spill out?
Who likes Minecraft?
I think some people didn’t understand but: whether they did or didn’t, here’s my view: Making some feel good about themselves for any reason meaning their looks or the way they work or how they keep their work up well or social status, ETC. you know— but it makes them feel fulfilled. that’s why compliments stick out to people with insecurities such as myself. And bullying doesn’t help. That’s why it’s important to be kind or respectful to people. Even if you don’t like them. And I mean friends and the outside world. When it comes to family, *idk about y’all but this generation’s family foiken sucks*
I love your shirt thats my favorite team
It's OK to be short
Again all these comments relate to him
I hope youl go on for long
Jesus Christ is returning repent!!!
If you don't get it if 6ou say too much nice stuff they will think it's not true
I thought he was about to say that we shouldn’t be too kind to each other lul
But they were being nice
:P
What? If we’re kind of people, we create slipping hazards? Being kind to people means telling them superficial things, some/many about things they can’t even control?  What idiot created this?
And it spilled because it got over-happy and then ended up crying of laughter
They are nice what are you talking about
Wait, what was the lesson
How is ur giant brother
So if you get too happy you... never mind
Be kind to people so their blood spills out of their bodies
What kind of teacher are you im curious
Imm missing the lesson here, if someone is nice they make others nice?
All of these things are true
I don’t get it??
So we pee ourself????   Great content
I never seen the type of BUCKET before⁉️ But that cup got filled up with splashes of good. Comment👍👍👍👍💯💯
WAIT A DAMN MINUTE   IS HE PETES DAD  THINK ABT IT  HIS LAST NAME IS THE SAME  AND HE HAS DWARFISM    AHHHAHAHAHVSJDDJBD
Nice video I've got complex post traumatic stress disorder generalized anxiety disorder and depression I often struggle to get close enough to people to make friends but I've often been described as having an inner glow the last two years of isolation caused by covid has zapped I'm struggling with feeling flustrated but my inner glow is starting to return in a world where you can be anything be kind kindness is something that everyone can afford to give wish every human being on planet earth was kind it would make the world a much easier place to live in.
I am so confused
I don't think so people already have huge egos
Seahawks tho?
I like how u think
Are you related to Peet montzingo
These kinds of lessons can be so helpful, in short bursts.
It's not a mistake ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE ✨
I’m confused
Dude I would’ve love to have you as a teacher when I was younger I probably would’ve turn out better
So that my mental sanity can spill even more?😂
I didnt understand why do we need to be nice to each other?
It's not a mistake ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
You like the see hawks I love them
We need to be kinder to each other so water comes out of our head

One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
He makes content for us to learn about
Are you from nova scotia because i see the seahawks sticker on thr stool
Cartman: HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAaaaaa

Be kind to make people piss themselves
So we can pee ourselves?
I don't understand it
You are soooo cool and kind
My elementary school always used to say “be a buck filler, not a bucket dumper”
To make them cream?😳

It's not a joke it's a hazard
Oh i think its oppesite day
Height doesent matter
This man made my day from his content
I thought that the lesson would be not to be overly positive and lie to others because it could make their ego too bit and give them a superiority complex. Just me? Okay
Thank you
Explain. This makes no sense
Hey mr Montzingo you should change your profile it’s a little bit boring.  Not trying to be rude!
It's not OKEH to be OKEH❤️ (titan cry)
The Seahawks beat the Cardinals
Kind

It's not a mistake ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE ✨
It's not a joke it's a hazard
I don’t get it
"It's not OKEH to be OKEH❤️(titan cry😭)"
“ It’s not a mistake”,✨IT’S A MASTERPIECE
So if we say nice things to people that’ll spill?
Ez
Does he mean dont be too kind?
Ah yes,water spills out of a person when you be kind to them Edit-reading this again,this sounds kinda sus lol
if they taught at an Australian high school students would constantly pick him up and carry him about
The last One is cap
You are good tho😁
Does anyone know where he teaches? I think he might be my cousin teacher
😀 hi am new to you channel .
You look so cool
Sooo, it overflowed with ego and became a horrible person that thinks they are above everyone else?
I like this dude cause he doesn’t just use his shortness to be a good tiktok creator like he actually posts good stuff
So the person will vomit, cry, pee and go through puberty
These shorts are amazing keep it up!❤️
What?
I like small people in general, they look like they would be nice to cuddle with 🥺
Dress up like a mini pekka
U remind me so much of my math teacher the way u laugh haha but I love small ppl
We should be kind to people so they have bladder control issues
Oh yeah Seahawks
I like your positive additude
You know for my mind it feels like the blood pressure goes so high up for the guy in the bucket his blood spilled out of him
But spilling isn't a good thing? Or is there something  I'm missing
I remember in 1st grade we read a book that talked about how everyone has a bucket that follows them everywhere and when someone is nice the bucket starts to fill but there are people who want to steal things from our buckets by being mean and how no one should be that person and then we all got to design our own cup to be our bucket
Yes another great lesson this is why this man deserves a reward
I love your videos they always make me smile and give me a lesson on what to do and what not to do ^w^
You are funny
It’s not a mistake it’s a masterpiece and I don’t get it
Most People don't how much words can change a person.
Guess you could say they overflowed with happiness
I once said to my sister say something positive and she's like I love all buddy not everybody all buddy
This is the best!
Go Seahawks
Go hawks!!!
Yes, go Hawks
Someone explain this to me omg sorry
I don't get the lesson
If im being honest ive had a big interest on little people ever since i was a toddler and seeing them on social media is amazing
I think the real lesson is too many compliments can overfill someone’s head and make them think they’re the main character of this world
Washtionton
Ay, fellow Washingtonian
Ayo😳
Morale of the story: leak when you get complements
What would be cool is that on cups, like once you are so happy, you make others happy, then they make others happy
Bro ur the best
Why do you never show Olivia?
Are you Peet monzingos dad?
Baby face kirby
Yes
Did he say he is a little teacher or your a good teacher and
So we can all get wet?  I think I missed the point
"It's not a mistake", ✨ ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
what's your class grade
I guess the water represents pride
So we can spill water? I am confused but ill probably understand this in a little im a bit slow   Edit: I now understand this what a good lesson
I get it. The cup "overflowed" with joy. But he said we need to be kind.. because it spilled??  😂
To pee on ower self
I love that shirt💙💚💙💚💙💚💙💚💙
Bro being happy is bad because when your put in the real world you get easily depressed
It’s not a mistake it’s a ✨Masterpiece✨
Yeah bro if you be nice to me my water will flow everywhere
😭😭😭😭I love this. nowadays it’s not even half way filled
Lies
Wait, are you Peet's brother?
Ayo😳
You’re gonna see me everywhere on YouTube
So we piss our pants? 🤨
Ouh brother of linguini, you are awesome
Wait saying kind things to people makes them pee?! I gotta try this!
Please add a channel icon this is james
Youre good at making.... Shorts.
Your a great influencer!! I love your vids
I dont get it
Ok this is the best teacher ever- He is so kind and always brings in good positive activity :))))
I always thought if you give compliments to fill up the cup but over filling a cup is not a good thing why is it used as an example to show feelings
It spilled, easy conclusion, it peed due to too much happiness
Can you be my teacher for a day?
Because then everyone soils themselves
It’s not a mistake it’s a masterpiece
I said No, this is why we need to be rude to each other or our guts will come out
And sometimes the water that spilled fills other buckets. So when you are nice to someone they may be nice to others to.
This is why I follow u great content keep up the great work!!!
The moral of this story: be kind to people, but don't be too kind or you'll make a mess.
I love this guy
This man is helping me more than my real teacher 😂😅
Josephk
It's not a mistake,✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨

The spilling water is a metaphor for the full bucket sharing kindness
👍Nice and wholesome
It's not a mistake✨It's a masterpiece✨
I see you rocking that Seahawk shirt do you teach in Seattle???
No that why u should not be kind all the time
This man needs 100k!!!
This is why we should be kind. So that we reach a limit and start ignoring all the kindness you give us, and then we have to pee.
Timmy exploded after receiving to many compliments
he’s so sweet 💕
Couldve been like we have to regulate how much we compliment someone or put pressure on people to do good and it makes then sometimes go over the egde “over spill”
What grade
If we are super happy we pee??????
Bucket
You seem like an awesome teacher but I honestly have no idea what metaphor you're trying to create here
I love this guy and keep up the good work
