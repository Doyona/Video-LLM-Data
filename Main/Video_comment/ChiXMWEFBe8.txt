Good betting Joni Barstow ❤️‍🩹
13:09 Can someone explain this shot to me 😂❤
6:36 England substitute wicketkeeper Sam Billings caught it nicely & 8:02 Jack Leach claimed 10- fer.
6:35
Hmmm. Really not convinced by bazball cricket. Neither is the commentary. If it's a case of changing your style to draw audiences, that's a bit silly as it's obvious more countries need to play the game for the game to grow. Cricket is a colonial game, historically. So that's the rub, not style. Only a few batsman really fit the bazball style in the England team. The others look uncomfortable, to say the least.
9:25
I love New Zealand losing badly to England 0-3 in the test series. New Zealand only strong in their own conditions. I'm very astonished how they qualified for wtc final first cycle. Bit of luck and rain interruptions they won the final. Love from India
🐆🐅🦁🐯
Is it so hard to include the reviews in the highlights lads?
That run out was so neatly done.
ll look lii lp logo pl L
They are waiting for a good opener for the removal of zack crawely he is not a good opener
Yruriufi
India got no chance
I love England Crowd 😍 First My Nation crowd(India 🇮🇳😍)
Ben stokes real captain
Pope is excellent
much but still havent found any solution to tNice tutorials....guys pls help  out!        ...it’s like the soft roll is blank
One of the best series in 2020s
Lovely series eng vs NZ  I have been fuckin waiting for this type of series which had all emotions and energy Since last ind vs ENG test
When will that day come back when Kohli will score a century and we Indians can also be proud of him 🌻
Bracewell gave too many loose deliveries just changed the momentum
Blundell deserved the century.....the way he played,the way he approached, the way he survives Newzealand from a shaming score....he actually deserves a lot more respect ❤️
This is a good video
What A team..🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧. Chased 3 times success fully..above 280..in 4 th INNINGS  Against The WC NZ...& IN ODI 498...🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏❤️👍👍👍👍👍
13:09 what a shot 🤯🔥
BCCI only want money from us they not post matches highlight whether international cricket or IPL after 2019 india playing less one day matches in 2023 50 over world Cup but our preparation nothing for 50 over world Cup more than 5 months we not play single one day match only playing t20 as Indian fan we want india play well winning ICC tournaments and we want  highlight of matches.
Fastest
Who watch from india
Disappointment for Mitchell
Even ABD will appreciate joe root six against Wagner 🙌🙌
Tera kya hoga Endia?? 🤣🤣
13:08 That Shot from Root 🔥🔥
Editor fucked up again-5
England team ko test me harana hai to joe root ko agar out kr liya to samjho aadha match jit gaye
Ye newzeland team ko ho kya gya h..na wecket le par rhe h na england ka rate rok pa rhe h..har test ki har pari eng.ka rate 4 ya 5 ka h ..ese toh ye kabhi bhi test match nhi jeet payenge.arey agar wecket nhi mil rhe toh run toh roko
pope Batting Line up Like lan Bill🔥.(Master Class)
I came for the Boult / Williamson runout and I'm glad I stayed for the Root reverse sweep.
Love you Joe root ❤
ICC should test England BAT very suspicious!
Great cricket
Tom Blundell played fearlessly in this innings.  Good innings from him though . 👏
Nz is not playing in serious mood..
Joe Root is England Cricket Test team’s Root…
Absolutely brilliant highlights from ECB. But one request, please add the Hawkeye and DRS clips. It would look even more interesting.
Root playing a reverse laps to wagner in a test match..... Nice!
Why don't you shows drs reviews clip in highlights  Just see the umpire reverse decision  Special request from india
Such a great channel , BCCI should learn from this, such quality videos with an hour from stumps
England they are playing test like Odis, Odis like t20 , & t20 like 10 over games . What if t10 format also introduce in cricket then they finish the match in one over .
Please change the editor
I think the way aus and eng is playing the test cricket we may see them playing the final of the WTC coming next year 👍👌✌️
Bairstow, Pope and Leach seem to have been reborn.  Well played Mitchell and Blundel for their enterprising partnerships.
Boring test series ever
Yes it's called test
ECB could start making films now bcs the way they edit match highlights is just awesome 🙌. Cheers to ECB for making Test Cricket such awesome...
𝙃𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙮 𝙗𝙞𝙧𝙩𝙝𝙙𝙖𝙮
New way of playing test match Bazz McCullum 😂 effect it seems
I was at headingly and honestly what a day for it and what an atmosphere
This series also know as Mitchell-blundell series... Hatsoff both of you
Small correction to ECB Eoin Morgan is not a WC winning captain, point reiterated, England won WC on some stupid rule England are yet to win WC properly ironically record books show fallacy, indeed ECB is a fall guy  cricket fans who love the game will not agree the way WC was awarded to England
Joe root great player
Daryl Mitchell must be the player of the tournament
Joe Root's Reverse-Scoop was fire 🔥
What a cricket in these two team 😲😳 outstading
13.09 proper test match cricket shot😂😂😂
Really I cannot understand why the New Zealand team is playing like a school team... even they don't try to draw the matches..... balling is look like helping the batsman....?🙁🙁
England chase down esaliy today day 5
I hate Daryl Mitchell performance against England
I hate Daryl Mitchell
Come on England
England win the test series 3 -0
New Zealand lost the test series 3 -0
Absolutely genius Joe Root
Class of Joe root
England have  done pretty much every thing right in the series, only they have no answers for mitchell and blundell😅😅😂😂
England's  approach is amazing  , joe root reverse sweeping a pacer for six in a test match, is this a test match😂😂😂
Battlefield pro
Nive cricket both teams
Pope is carbon copy of Ian  bell
Great to see English side back in form. Now we can surely expect far more thrilling and competitive ashes series compared to the recent one. Stokes as a team leader has changed the dynamics of the team. Everyone is looking for an oppurtunity to click at the right time. Be it Jhonny Bairstow in the second test or Ollie Pope now commanding in the current test. Great stuff overall! 👊
England openers are still a big concern. Crawleys struggle is getting worst with every match.
I like Mitchell straight shot against spinners Like leach in this series
Dom sibley has to make his way back in this side, to accompany root up the order.
Blundell and mitchell r becoming better day by day
Really liking this new approach from England! Really ballsy
Watched it in person, what an experience! Test match cricket is well and truly alive.
Root is perfect in test cricket so he is practicing for T20 WC
Blundell consistent performance 🔥
There are only three players Boult Mitchell and Blundel from NZ came to win against ENG 11.
I’m a bit annoyed they didn’t show us the reviews
13:09 Joe Root SIX
Love from India
They are England Cricket👏👏
Zac Crawley not a test players give the chance to athar player wo desarve the chance. Also Crawley not in form.
so much partiality not only by the umpires but also the ECB highlights, not bothered to show the not out decisions by 3rd umpire.  hope indian team survive these jackals.
micheal on one hand scoring runs and the other hand dropping catches and running out team mates
England Team: Target 296 No Problem..................too easy for us
1st Time Good Quality Highlights from them💕 Keep going
Mitchell and Blundel became backbone for New Zealand because in the entire series they made over 100 partnership in every innings
Boult &Southee ,shami &bhumrah,Anderson&broad,Lee& McGrath.... Evergreen pair......Really a treat to watch....🔥
Root is my favorite  player
What a series we have seen 🔥🔥🔥🔥 It was an amazing series where we saw Joe Root's masterclass in the first test match and in the second &third we saw brilliant innings by Jonny Bairstow, amazing batting by Pope in last 2 matches + Mitchell and Blundell batting throughout series 🔥🔥and Boult, Potts (very well done debutant 👏), Southee and all the bowlers well played, thank you for producing such a wonderful series New Zealand and England 🤩🤩  WORLD CRICKET UNITY ✌
Are you ready England For test For India
Look for ind vs eng it's very tough I think ...Root and stokes,new england with McCullum... Looking for Kohli's masterpiece with this new england.....
Blundell and Mitchell again and again
The same english players choked on indian tracks.
Come on ecb
Really appreciate Mitchell and Blundell they give atleast a chance for fighting for the bowlers...
What a series we have saw 🔥🔥🔥🔥 It was a amazing series where we saw Joe Root's masterclass in first test match and in second &third we saw brilliant innigs by jonny Bairstow, amazing batting by pope in last 2 matches + Mitchell and blundell batting through out series 🔥🔥and Anderson, board, Jamieson, and all the bowlers well played 🤩🤩, thank you for producing such a wonder new Zealand and England 🤩🤩....
Watching Cricket being played in England is on next level. The decent clapping sound and cheering style from the crowd during the Test matches is always very attractive and influntial 👍....
Even if it is a 3-0, anybody who has watched the series would agree that it could have been the other way round as well. What a peach of test series!!
England Cricket again like in 2005 keeps test cricket alive with a new style of playing test cricket... Great... What a series...
Watching it from Pakistan ..
The question here is, will they get the same success with the same attacking approache on asian turning pitches and australia and africa bouncy pitches!!!
this is crawley's last test match
Man whoever made these pitches is genius. Something for everybody batsmen, spinners, seamers. And also getting the results.
Mitchel and bhundell only two batsman who fight beautifully and batting nicely
Pope and Root look good at 3 and 4. Sorry Zach, take a break and come back, but you aren't in a good place with your game atm
Why need bracewell play like T-20
It was neither a one sided series nor a boring one, both the teams dominated each and every session in their own way, every aspect of each game was top notch and delight to watch🌝!!!
Odi
I don't understand 4 bowlers strategy when u don't hv any all-rounder in a test match. And bracewell doesn't look like a pro bowler to me. Should hv selected Ajaz or Santner.
I am liking this new aggressive style by England  -  but Crawley has to go ,bring in Butler to open with Lees and drop Folks gives the option to bring in an extra bowler or all rounder
England will win A series easily New Zealand also played good cricket in all test matches
England me Jake England ko 2-1 se pelna har kisi ke bas ki bat nhi KING HOHLI
Again NZ failed to capitalise on the foundation gave by blundell and Mitchell. Lower order couldn't extend the lead. Really poor cricket from black caps.
What has happened to New Zealand's pace attack.... They are looking toothless... When you had close to 300 runs to defend in the 4th innings of a test match and you just concedes more than half of the runs in 39 overs.... What we can say more about them.... Young, williamson, nicholls, latham( apart from last innings here) have struggled a lot..... This was the same Newzealand who won against India and lifted the WTC title 😳
Does anyone know where I can DOWNLOAD THE FREE APP?
I think Brendon Mcculumm coverted england test team 2 odi team...😅👍👌
This game belongs to Englishman in the past and now also belongs to how to play odi and T20 cricket after 2015 they teach all now test cricket also same as limited over cricket this is same for Indian cricket because we have a richest board in the cricket World but never produce any thing extraordinary hate off the eng team👆
Hatts off to the English crowd
I understand Cricket is alive when we see England team is playing the game❤️
It's not Pope it's a 💩  🤣
Chunoo Bahi  Ma ap ka bhoat bara fan hu  Mere ak challenge ha  Agr ap emote mar kay one tap mar do gay desert eagle say  Ma ap ko 1000 diamonds 💎 du ga
just watch all the highlights for just root shot
India will give them the fight they want
HEYY ECB EDITOR!   show every first and last ball of each season  If DRS is taken then show direct pitch impact   You didn't showed 50 of Tom blundell And also copy highlights for the third test from first or second because all test has same story 😂
Blundel master class
Ye team khali ghar me hi accha khelti hai....India Australia me inki chud jaati hai puri.....Ghar pe hi jyada test khel ke khudko champion samajhte hai
Poor bowling and batting from new zealand I feel like trent bolt is the only bowler in the team
When it comes to highlights ecb is the best.
Yrr ye england wale NZ se khel rhe hai k India walo.ko daraa rhe hai?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jos buttler best bating in Nederland.
Noone is appreciating Tom Blundel and Daryl Mitchell..   I mean their partnership has entered God mode in this series🙂🙂
New Zealand missing fast bolar Luke Ferguson.
This match darly mitchel nd tom blundell vs england
Chutiya BCCI, England se kuch sikho chutiyo highlights dala karo YouTube pe 😂
I am embarrassed to Williamson,he didn't play serious game,why
Wait for ind vs eng  test match.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shambolic fielding from both sides
NZ might have lost but they batted and bowled brilliantly nevertheless. England on the other hand with a great approach and fine form as a team after McCullum joined as a coach.
Nz played well, its just Englands new approach is just too lethal 😨😨
I've no idea what mccullum has done but the change is unbelievable... this is so unlike anything I've ever seen in the test arena...it looks like the odi brand of cricket brought into test cricket... whatever they are paying mccullum it's worth it and then some
Root is so much consistent batsman one of the favourite batsman of mine  in test cricket
Michael bracewell good all rounder but not a good bowling
Joe root what a player what a shot  reverse sweep  shot six  specially Wagner  wow  brendon mcclum  effect
Mitchell blundell  lattham Conway New Zealand star 🌟 new Star  England star 🌟 new old  ben stokes bairstaw pope root  J overton dream debut  what a series  eng players nz players
Jake leach  10 wickets  💟💟💟 wow 1 innings 5 wicket haul  2 innings 5 wicket haul  specially England pitch ground
wait for just few day s india lifting the test 🏆 and we celebrate 🎉🎉
What a difference Ben stokes and Brendon McCullum made 🔥🔥🔥
Olie pope is similar to Ian Bell. England should persist with him. Next best team in terms of talent after IND  and they have got good bunch of players
Mitchell & Blundell ki jodi sab pe bhari
Nz missed Jamieson
It's going to be really tough for India
Try to create short highlights
Watch till end சார்பாக வீடியோ வெற்றி பெற வாழ்த்துக்கள்
England will white wash by 3-0 i was saying this from 1st day of this series
Blundell and Mitchell 🤝
Upload with English subtitles plz 😀
Mitchell and Blundell saved New Zealand from an embarassing series. No questions asked.
Zac Crawley plays a lot like Marcus Trescothick. The only problem is that he isnt scoring like him
England is looking dangerous.... beginning to gel well under the new coach and the captain.....India has to play really tough cricket to beat this side in the upcoming one off test
Thankyou England for keeping the best format of the game alive.... Keep it on..!!
Can we appreciate the two pillars of New Zealand Blundell and Mitchell in the series
It will be interesting to see England's approach against the best bowling attack in the world...
Yes. The Highlights are supurb. Newzealand will be whitewhased
It was a blunder by NZ not to play Ajaz Patel...Blunder by Williamson and they say Williamson is a good captain just on the basis of fluke WTC win..
India needs to bring their A game or they are toast 🥲
England cricket Awesome
watching test cricket in England is just so fabulous. no other countries can provide such entertainment. what a series it was.
Waiting for 🇮🇳 vs 🇬🇧  test , this time England is much stronger, could be a thrilling series .
Totally change momentum Brendon meccullum....
Eng Vs Nz ODI series 😂💯🔥✴️
The only thing exciting in this series is watching Blundell and Mitchell playing together and building partnerships in tough time
2023 test championship winner 🏆 ENGLAND
England will be win
Newzealand has gully cricket spinner 😂
Alex Lees another Mr.Cook in making ! ✌🏼
NZ missing a quality spinner
well palying pope
Pope was playing the spin like an Indian player  Absolutely brilliant 😀
Blundel is a damn fighter
why they are not showing review decision ? pretty strange..
Plz show the lbw Hawkeye video
India!!! Be aware of this team 😝
Bhalu
❤️🇧🇩❤️🇧🇩❤️
In our Asia like India, pak,bang,srilanka test Cricket match don't have much crowd like people usually love to watch odi and t20 but in England it is really good to see such a noise from Crowd in test as usual ❤️..
Cricket is only famous in india 90% viewers from india 😂
English batting has been impeccable
Viraaaaaat kohli sentury 71th in England
I really appreciate that ecb put highlights very early
Ashley Lazy giles & Ex admin nearly killed ENG test team. How come they did not see talent of Potts, Lees, J overton & Foakes as keeper batsman is beyond comprehension.
Daryl Mitchel gets a very good knocks in this series
Test cricket is alive because of 3 teams  India , Australia and England
Root is the root of England
I am confused, why are the spectators booing Joe Root?
I love english cricket....Cricket means England....
England win the series but Blundell and Mitchell wins our heart 💓
Today day 5 England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 will chase 296 & win the series by 3-0
10 wickets in one match 5 in 1st innings 5 in 2nd innings Great bowling jack leachh🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
please show drs too
Good from England, Mitchell and Blundell had a good test with the bat even if New Zealand loses, their middle order is solid with those two
England  opnerr   is  not  properly  setup  after  retired  cook
Ausi cirket YouTube channel and ECB YouTube channel osm
Mitchell 538 runs in 3 matches he played so well but nz batting was overdependent on blundell and mitchell and bowling on trent boult you cant win by contribution of 2 3 players for eng all players contributed root pope bairstow all scored centuries bowlers did their job
Can't wait to see when Mighty Indians Fiery Seamers will Throw Punches to these Pirate Kids.
It's a treat to watch a Test match in England.
Can Matche draw hoga kya
THE WESTINDIES BEAT ENGLAND 🇬🇧 LAST TEST MACTH
I can't understand why Mitchell santner and ish sodhi key bowlers of NZ are not playing
🤍
I hope England will win this match smoothly ، and I wish to Joe Root to score another hundred ، keep it up man
Feels like a new era for English cricket. Just like how after years of being dreadful in ODIs we revolutionised our approach. This feels the same
England amazing batting bowling perfect team england but not destory bundell  and mithcell patnership ..amazing batting back back blundell and dary mithchal
It will be a tough competition for India against England top class side
blundell footwork and wristwork is so indian
Olie pope is next ian bell of england
England it's my fav🍻
I love ECB
What a brilliant form blundell and Mitchel back to back half centuries and partnerships building to high score NZ  well done 👍,  leach what a spells  in this test match 10wicket haul 👍👍 in test match .
I hope england can win 🏅
Pope is the future captain of england for sure.
Congrats to pope he has played some beautiful shots
Nothing can match up to great Test cricket!
Blundell continuously showing his class😊
Live in you thube 👍👍👍👍
England team looks formidable in all three formats...they are on their way to dominate this decade 💥💥
Joss Butler should open the batting in test match vs India . Then England will destroy the opponents bowlers
Happy to watch your highlights with beaut commentary an atmosphere of game present , beaut cricket
Ind vs ENG test to watch out?
After ross Taylor Nathan astle  New era begins for NZ  WITH MITCHELL & BLUNDELL U R Proud for NZ
England has the best test crowd.
Ajaj patel would have been better choice...injured?
India is coming ECB👿👿😈
Need a one good opener and we’re on top
c u at birmingham.... indians waiting to destroy ur batting line up..... may be greatest series won in history of cricket
Want a good and agressive innings from stokes against India at least a hundred including 7 sixes
Series of runs..nz play really hard in full series..deserves a win
ECB has best quality of video quality and highlights.
Defeating this brute England team in 5th test isn't going to be easy for india
Impressive strokeplay from Root and Pope, especially the reverse slog sweep to Wagner. I remember he played a similar shot in W20 in 2016 in a run-chase of 200+ target. Lots of oppurtunities in the slip cordon today, might well have been a different story if those were hold onto.
What a great inning by pope and Root 🔥🔥🔥🔥
RADHE SHYAMG
Watching England team in England is great filling and I like the England crowd too how they react on four , ton or wicket .
Chasing 300 on the 5th day? NZ is in the drivers seat in my opinion.
Another fascinating days play. What a series this has been. Belief flooding through England players but please can Stokes go to 1st slip for Leach?! 🤣
InCase you don't know, what is the dislike count after 23k likes, 0!
I hope Zak Crawley figures it out and gets back into the England team.
Waiting for next Ashes🔥
More than live match.... I enjoy watching highlights.... Great work and quality cricket.... ECB has maintained the spirit and class of the game!
brace well is worst spinner 😂
Difference Between ENG and NZ in this test is Jack Leach!! He was just too good in his every spell, hardly Gives any Loose ball and taking wickets in continue intervals,  on the Other side , Bracewell giving hit me balls on continue Intervals 😞. Such a poor team selection from NZ , playing with 3 proper bowlers only and the 4th one is not even a proper all rounder!! Will be suprised if Match will go to the second session today!!
Wow 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 what a turnaround. Just few months all the jokes were on England and look at the current situation. Few changes in management and here you go .... It proves the importance of the man management.
Test cricket in England and the English crowd is sensational
I feel bad for nz. They are always the victim of new England.  Once in 2015 when England transformed its white ball team and now.
BCCI should learn some lessons from ECB .. how to create perfect highlights...
blundell cover drive,, superrr
Root best
ENG vs NZ Series Conclusion   Bairstow  back to on fire  Blundel & michel backbone of NZ  Fearless chasing Strategy
he's just reverse scooped Wagner into the rugby stand 🤯 13:09  Root Root Root are u practicing for T20 world cup 😎.
It is not going to be easy for India to win the last test match against this English side. The batters are so out of form that only Pant and Pandya look like scoring fifties. On the other hand Root is in the form of his life and same thing can be said about Bairstow too. India' s bowling is much much better. Shami, Bumrah, Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Umesh are much better than the New Zealand bowlers. Ashwin will prove to be a greater threat than the entire New Zealand attack. But my money is on England.
Michel & Blundel Golden Test Series
Thanks for posting.
538 runs in 6 innings 💥 107.60 Average  ➡️👌🏻 3 Hundreds 3️⃣💥        What a series for Daryl Mitchell 🏆🎀
The fake accent of Sangakara is very irritating to hear
If England win this and the series 3 nil it will make for one hell of a final test against India, with positive momentum going in that will be a firecracker. Expect fireworks people. The series i'm most keen to watch is the test series against South Africa, now here is two team who haven't always shown each other pleasantries on the field and SA have been in red hot form of late. Plenty of cracking test match cricket to come this summer.
Blundell and Mitchell in this series like rrr ram and ntr
13:10 what in the world is Root doing? Did it in the last test as well. Awesome!
Common trend through out the series..  Match keeps swinging like pendulum on first 4 days..  On every day 5, England starts as favorites and ends as winners..
Test cricket is alive and kicking!!
I would never expected this series to go the way it has. England were down-and-out easy beats, NZ are the world Test champs. If you'd told me it was going to be a 3-0 whitewash pretty much everyone would have thought it would be NZ doing the winning, and that would have been quite a reasonable conclusion to reach. England have reinvented themselves big time, and now look to be nigh on unbeatable, they've made the Kiwis look foolish even though they've played good cricket and have acquitted themselves very well. Amazing.  If England can hold on to this kind of form the next Ashes series ought to be fantastic. It's interesting that Australia went through a similar situation last year, lacklustre performances, the captain and coach both quit and the new captain/coach is leading them in a much better direction and they're all of a sudden winning again. They dismantled England last summer, but I reckon beating England in England will be a very difficult prospect now. Bring on the next Ashes!
What are people's opinions of Zak Crawley?
NZ England aus sa pitch is best.why Indian pitches are bad.all credit goes to dhoni who tempered Indian pitches
ENG zitbe inshallah
Alekes Lee's replies jeson Roy
why does root gets booed playing a shot?
Joseph Edward Root 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NZ missing badly a prime spinner liken Ajaz Patel and Ish Sodhi...   Bracewell not effective at all 🥺
Nice batting by Tom blundell and Daryl Mitchell
AND NOW ENGLAND IS READY FOR INDIA NOT LIKE JUST LAST TIME BUT WITH NEW ENGLAND APPROACH TEAM...
13:09 joe root
mitchael and blundell are ❤️❤️❤️❤️for this series but england is my favourite
Title should have been Edge masterclass by pope and root.

We are watching highlights of 2nd day ist innings
Pope is playing like Ian bell. Great player great to watch
Darrel Mitchell + Tom blunddell ....they are nailed it
Comes up too early in his stance , not a Test Keeper .
Pope is look like I bell
Why Billing’s Keeping ?
I loves Southee bowling action . He swings the bowl beautifully like Anderson
Lees technique is just remind us like Sir Alstair Cook does 😁
Fun fact : Indian people waiting highlights for the day  more than English and kiwis..... 😀
Why can't they show the review...a few seconds of ball tracking won't hurt ECB...😌
Blundell and Mitchell reminds me of VVS Laxman and the  🧱 Rahul Dravid
Love from 🇵🇰 Pakistan
England are on another level....
Outstanding Performance both Teams👍
Very good highlights
England cricket now rules like australia
Joe champion root 👏
Joe root just good in home away he is choker see their 10 inning in ashes in Australia..
NZ missed Ajaz Patel badly
Root is devilliers of test cricket 🏏
The best place to watch test cricket-England... Not just the teams participating but crowd too..
Stokes and Mcullum making England very strong and aggressive team I like it....
Potts is having same bowling action like Muhammad shammi
Reality check black Caps. You're actually pretty damn average, and sometimes flatter to deceive against other teams playing badly. Against quality opposition you just have no fight.
England forget thi is test they play with odi teyp
1:10 amazing spin
Thanks ECB
Appreciate England  Yu back people in Test match
Superb Pope
England is the best cricket team imo.
Too fast and careful for his audiences…precious responsibility displayed by ECB…Thanks ECB for being entertaining us… Loves From India 🇮🇳
Billings 🤔🤔🤔
Thanks for video; please include DRS with ball tracking, hawk eye prediction!!
Good work by ecb i really appreciate❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
But i like Balckcaps.
what happened to us(kiwi) this series don't know we have chance to win all matches but somehow we lost but love the captain and team as always 🖤
Kiwis need improvement in their Bowling Unit and the rest is good  Only Boult can't win game for his team other teammate need to support him, otherwise loss is written in their Fate💜
2:14 I think the ball was hit twice by the bat if we see closely maybe due to that it went almost behind the keeper
Eng vs Ind playing 11 Eng                                     Ind Malan                                Gill Crawley                            Agarwal Pope                                 Pujara Root                                  Kohli Stokes                              Shreyas Bairstow                          Pant Buttler                              Ashwin Potts/Woakes               Shardul Broad                               Shami                        Leach                               Umesh/Siraj Anderson                        Bumrah
India we are coming
Love the batting style of england..❤️ Take love from bangladesh..
Pope us something big
Light:I M The Fastest Thing In The World Ecb:Hold My Highlights
Light:I M The Fastest Thing In The World Ecb:Hold My Highlights
It would be good if they stop the match when DRS goes down, just like a rain break else it again becomes an unfair game. One wicket this way or the other way good change the direction of a test match Blundell was given out lbw by Umpire Richard when DRS was down, that was the turning point of the match, this innings he was given lbw by the same umpire but DRS turned it down, needless to say Richard Kettleborough is one of the ordinary umpires in the panel.
Wow the stadium is fully crowded
A clinical clean sweep reckons for the Brits.
Some serious thought will be going on about Player of the series.  Bairstow , Blundell and Mitchell dead heat so far. Unbelievable batting!
The only problem with these highlights is that you don't show the ball tracking when there's an LBW decision referred. Need to show that. That's important.
Never win England on indian team
New Zealand team is missing a perfect fast bowler of the calibre of Shane Bond, who can run through the batting side.

I like only Test match highlights ; which played on ENGLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 & Australia 🇦🇺 grounds only !!
Indian cricket team is next in line to get the stick. It will be an epic thrashing no doubt!
Weak NZ bowling found out again.
I would play the Overton brothers 1 and 2 and Tom Abell at 3 and no changes from there on. We would be unbeatable!!!
Isky bd India ko bi chodegy england waly😂😂
They still have Ollie Robinson waiting in the wings. This new look England is playing pretty solid thus far
England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 win this series
I hope Billings can bat because he sure as hell cant keep
Blundell became one man army after Mitchell's dismissal
Bring on the Aussies which is going to be the real litmus test
Mitchell and Blundell are NZ's backbone in this series
Quality as always. But missing Bumble and Holding
Brilliant day by England
Moin Ali is missing
13:09 - Unbelievable shot...
Brilliant series from both sides, daryl mitchell and Tom blundell so consistent! Daryl mitchell will definitely be player of the series for nz, Jack leach first ten wicket haul and ollie pope will get hundred again and root consistent too
Weeee are theee Arrrmyy....The Barrrmy Arrrmyyy...and we are mental...and we are mad...wee are the loyalist...cricket supporters...the wooooorrrlddd - has everrrr had 🤣🤣
Masterclass in what? Edging the ball
9:40 is that shubham gill?😳
Why is no one talking about the ball at 6:09? The drift was insane!!!
Why is the ground half empty?
Man of the match leach but overton deserve it for his all round performance
This has to be the most shithouse 10fa in cricket history.8 hole outs and 2 lbw's for people in the first 3 balls playing for any turn at all
❤️❤️ from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
i am exicetd to watch india and england.. and i know now a dayas indian team is so week so england can win with withwash....
Ollie pope is the new Ian bell, he's brilliant
Stop watching England after the humiliations to India and Australia in the test series, it looks like they might be back on track now, we need some revenge!
That 6 from Root....what an extraordinary shot
Get Buttler in too for that kind of batting. He is explosive.  Aggresiveness is the key for ENG now.  Love it.  😃
New Zealand is giving their best but this England team is something else
Firstly Foakes, then Bairstow, now Billings? What’s going on with the WK choice for England?
How come Foakes isn’t keeping?
What a transformation under BM.
Tom Blundell so deserve a century this series , Has been fighting . Deserves as much praise as Mitchell.
New Zealand played absolutely brilliant every game. England is just in beast mode.  I have never seen a team consistently chasing 300+ easily in test matches.
The BEST english team ever!!!!!
Can we take a moment and criticize them for spoiling all the results in thumbnail before we watch the highlights.
Nz has not won a series in last 12 months...I think they definitely need a think tank and their team selection is super odd...leaving out Wagner in the first 2 tests then playing all rounder as a spinner when u have front line spinner at 8 ...
Pope always tell with his batting that he is the new Ian Bell for England
We are seeing this summer the emergence of one of the best methodologies to play test cricket. When it comes to white ball cricket, we saw how England changed their approach in 2015 and the rest is history:-). I am thrilled to bits to be honest - I do feel we can win the test against India starting on July 1. I wish either Archer or Woods was fit and Crawley was in a better form but keeping my fingers crossed for rest of the lads.  I think it’s going to be an unmissable summer of Cricket for us :-)
I tell you what there was something very off about DRS and hawkeye yesterday, it wasn't accurate at all and it kept shutting off the image from side on way too fast with no replays. How on earth some of the balls were going over the stumps is a complete physics mystery.
Tim southe are completely failed in this series
England is totally in command of the test now, they surely will make a clean sweep today....
The English in General will get long arm's from patting themselves on the BACK, they are ONLY PLAYING  the South Sea Poms.
Number of adverts in these highlights is egregious
England has the best Test crowd in cricket
What sportsmanship. Cricketers who respect each other. No sledging or unpleasantness like some countries
13:09 This shot....OMG complete out of the box thing 🔥🔥
Test ko T20 bana diya england ne
Congratulations Mate's what a Series you've played as Champions and Deserve the Results keep pressing on as the Road is going to be Rough however Well done
Root's reverse scoop/sweep off Wagner - Cor! He made it look like a textbook shot!
Light- im the fastest thing in the universe 😏. ECB - hold our match highlights 😎.
It’s great to be an English cricket fan at the moment. Long may it last.🏏
Congrats Leach for a five wicket haul in both matches!
Exciting that England have switched to some aggressive cricket but want Joe to play his natural game. Absolutely no need to play extravagant strokes -- that reverse scoop off Wagner should get a mention. Joe is the backbone, a kind of Dravid in the line-up and his role is to hold the innings together. Joe, you listening to me?
Oh no we need new players at number 1, 2 and 3 spot. I suggest Jamie Overton at number 1 and Tom Abell at number 2 and Josh Bohannon at number 3.
How did leach get a 5fer
Kane😢
Okay D Mitchell is good as a batsman in this series but as a fielder he failed and apart from blundell he failed to build partnership with other , included in most of his patners run out and assisted a catch....
Why don’t india ever post highlights? They love money too much
10:29 Pope has a future
Pope is so tinny , little and cute he is a good contender to becomes my new crush .
Fast bowling has been pathetic throughout the series … if a team can’t defend 300 score than it’s useless …
Newzealand needs one top class Spiner like Daniel Vittori. Brecewell's line and length is very disappointed one. Short and leg,short and leg,short and leg 😡😡 POTS should be Daryl Mitchell in my opinion 🤞🤞
As an Indian fan I am both excited as hell by England and kinda worried
Most teams in Test cricket history would gulp at the thought of chasing 250+ on Day 4 or 5.  Test cricket nowadays has made a mockery of that lol. Even 320+ isn't a safe target as we saw in the Indian chase against Australia.  Even this series my God! Bairstow wtf man! 😂🙏🔥
root tried a rishabh pant and did better than him , he was a pure magician with the bat
The adventure continues.
Can India win against this English side??🤔🤔
@ 2:14 has to be a double hit...poor cricket by England , no appeal
Brilliant highlights again from the ECB. Its golddust for someone like myself living in Berlin....thanks and Englands revival under Msrs Stokes, Bairstow, Root and all the others is just brilliant
That six by root against wagner was incredible i really loved it😍
Good to see Leach proving to all his doubters that he is England's best spinner, anyone that's watched him at somerset knew it already but so glad he's proved himself this series
Always love to see Test matches in 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 because of English fans.The way they clapping and cheering whole day its joy to watch❤️❤️From Bangladesh
Well bowled Jack Leach!  Set up nicely for the final day.
One of worst cricket team in test is England who play's test like odi👎
Irritating players in ECB
Yet another day that’s a fantastic advert for test cricket. Well played England, well played NZ, well played test match crowds. Let’s celebrate this wonderful format of the game for many, many years to come.
Can u include Hawkeye in the replays? 🙏🏾
Always had a strong opinion that this New Zealand team is highly overrated & absolute home track bullies against lesser oppositions.... it's so happy to see them lose this badly.... they .lost 0-3 in aus in 2019, lost in india in 2021, never won in south africa & now about to get whitewashed in Eng....they truly deserve it..... WTC winner my foot.....😀
I think Potts has been a seriously good find for England, his control is excellent and ends up reaping rewards and not just for himself. England have needed another bowler with the ability to control scoring.
This new England is wonderful to see, but can they keep it up against a snarling, ruthless, spitting Australia? That would be the true test
I'm from India but i like England's cricket because of great test matches.
Weldone  🇬🇧 you are exceptional 👏
England during their batting in tests play like ODIs, in ODIs they play like t20, in t20 play like T10.
Watching the game live I can tell you that there was about 4 drops not included but still well played England
Azaz Patel is much better spin bowler than bracewell..
Night and day difference from the tour of the West Indies - there is a fearlessness about England as if they don't care about losing and just want to entertain.
England were riding on a bit of hope. Each player got some luck today
What an ordinary bowler southee is
England played really well it is unfortunate for new Zealand where they played very well but unable to mark any win
Without virats captaincy this ruthless england team will rollover india.
Both teams played good cricket in this series but england win the moment where game decides. Scorecard will show you 3-0 but in my opinion this series can go either way.
Love to watch england's cricket... Don't know why, may be my second favourite team after India....
I don't know why NZ play with just 3 bowlers. To beat this England batting line-up, you need 5 specialist bowlers. They play nearly 8 batsman and only two of them performing. Why can't reduce two batsman and replace them with good bowlers. Remove bracewell, Henry Nicols, opener Young and replace them with bowlers.. Then NZ can provide good fight...
Why is there no mention of Leach’s fifer or Bracewell’s innings.
Jos Buttler in for Crawley as an out-and-out opening batsman? Or would you stay with Crawley and hope that he can find his form during the India Test? Would be ironic dropping Overton for Anderson after his heroic 97 at a crucial time, while retaining Crawley who looks uncomfortable in there..... for that matter, and the amount of runs Crawley is contributing in his current form, you could send Overton out as an opener and just hope for the best 🤣
NZ is in field with very weak bowling side
IND vs ENG...
Poor responses by boult, he could have taken single or defend the ball specially when a set batsman was batting with him, blundel couldn have hit century and make some useful runs in the end for the kiwis.
it's time to give Hameed another opportunity۔ crawely should play county cricket for atleast 2 or more years to be prepared for international cricket  ۔۔۔
All cricket boards upload highlights like ecb i appreciate you
I just love england cricket
Congrats🥳 England cricket fan win the match wideshiaa
Well done 👏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💙
❤️🤝
Root is roots from England team... every time
Love England cricket in England from 🇮🇳
I wouldn’t say it was a Pope masterclass, sure there were some good shots but lots of his runs were off the edge of the bat. Hats off to the Root & Pope partnership though
Can't believe Headingley is half empty! Wtf???
Michael is playing like Bradman 👍 just missed the century
I just don't understand why the 11th player taking areal while the batter is available at non striker... This is poor cricket from nz...
Now l would wanna see the England playing against Australia 😋😋
Root is really masterman 🥰🥰
Mr pope like ian bell
Indian Team should be wary of this attacking England approach
Hats off to ECB
My love is with UK players.. Wow
*ONE OF THE BEST HIGHLIGHTS PROVIDING YOUTUBE CHANNEL... GOOD WORK ECB ❤️🔥*
KIWIS Missing Ajaz Patel in Playing 11
Poor umpiring
2:14 , double bat , and four runs, FEILDER STUNNED , 13:08 WAAH KYA SHOT HAAY
Great  England cricket
13:08
Missing Michael holding in commentary pannel
Good work from ECB for having the highlights on so quickly.
Hats off to the Englishmen this natch suddenly turned into an unthinkable  drama
If you agree or not Mitchell will be the mega star of Nz
ENG has won the series but they will never forget Mitchell and blundell masterclass in this series ❤️😂😂
England got their permanent batter for no 3.
Eng 220 india 45 & 49
Mitchell and Blundell.... They are the savior for new Zealand in this series.......
I think Potts bowling action must be get checked he's jerking
Can't wait for the t20 world cup I am anxious and what I like about the Caribbean all the bars and clubs shows the cricket on tv
leach is so underrated! he is one of the best England players rn!!!!
Feel for blundell 🥺 absolutely played amazing but can't get to his median hundred in this series 🥺
I hope they have the same attitude against the Aussies when next we meet.
Now the test between ind and eng will be more difficult!
All I want in life is Sleep, Food & Pope Masterclass.
Why don't they show drs reviews
Hello I'm frm India I'm just a susestion I'm supporting the  both team ❤️ they play ! I would like to remind  Indian without MS7Dhoni
Rather than wasting 5-6 seconds by showing umpire's and player's disappintment, just show the relevant bowl tracking or ultra edge on the review please
The more u win the more interesting it becomes, definitely they have the advantage of being in that test matches shell, but still it will be fun when our bowlers ran over batsman. Bairstow won't be able to score even 20 odd runs, he hasn't faced the pace, the bounce that the Indian bowler have until now it's all seam And swing but Indians bring an extra factor of pace and the English won't be liking it😈😈😈
This year, England team are looking very dangerous now. Bairstow, Pope, Stokes and Root are playing so good and smashing many runs and Broad, Leach, Matty Potts and Anderson are also bowling really well. 🤯🤯😳😳 Stokes(Captain)-McCullum(New Head Coach) era works. 💪💪🔥🔥 Edit - Jamie Overton has also tried his best in both Batting and Bowling and his 97 runs will be etched in our memories eternally.
kamruzzaman,, hi(England's)!
To the admin   YOU ARE GREAT ❤️🔥
We're surely going to win this game too. Great start to Stokes' captaincy!
Just loving test cricket only in ENGLAND waooo great home support for ENGLAND
11:55 that guy should never field slip to a spinner again.
Never did I ever think I would enjoy test cricket this much ! Players of the series: Bairstow and Mitchell for sure !
Where is satner and ish sodi the main spiner of newzland??
Truely ECB are fab with their uploading matches videos keep going love from India 😇
NZ is missing a good spinner otherwise NZ would have won the series. English batsman legs shake in front of good spinner.
What was wrong with this channel yesterday waited for highlights till 1 pm in Europe 😳
Jack Leach 's shortened run up seems to have done the trick.
Someone please tell ecb to leave Crawley
ECB following Cricket Australia in uploading highlights😅🔥
Kiwis top order failed throughout, root was back in form made a huge difference, Mcullum and Stokes approach was amazing. Attacking thorough the series.
Both changes of ECB is going totally favour of England Ben Stokes captaincy and Brendan muccullum coaching
England is playing absolutely brilliant well done keep it up
England ki match dekhna ma alag maza ata ha .they have best  entertaining batting line up in the world 👍
Nz top order has failed blundell and Mitchell have really carried them
England is on another level
Fearless England Cricket Like Brendon McCullum.
Loves when audience says roooooooottttt...😜😂😂
ECB needs to understand that Zak Crawley isn't their next Joe root or Alistair cook,just because he can play some classy cover drives.    Let Harry brook make a debut in the test  team and let Harry open the innings with Sam Billings. I mean having a wicket keeper batsman at the top order will be very helpful for England's in subcontinent since all wk batsmans are good player of spin .
NZ needs more stardy strategy to go ahead. Spacer should keep ball on Off and Middle stumps with waist height which is tought height for British players in many occassions
English crowd is totally involved in the game.
What great viewing today...again England v the black caps.....not the white feathers..as I said..sorry all kiwis fans....both teams  playing good cricket...one of the most entertaining series at home for a long time...Mel
Mitchell is a talented batsman but NZ needs to replace him as a slip fielder.
leach 10wm let's go
watching test cricket live on TV played in Australia and England feels something special
Lees is just like cook❤️
6:11 illegal bowling
Where are people who were crying for Wagner to be included in the squad?
2:14 what a improvised shot 😁😁 he saw the sleeper then changed the ball's direction
Blundell and Mitchell is used to 136kph bowling. England might used Mark Wood against them like Smith and Labuschagne, Rohit and Rahul.
Interesting to see how new management and captain face India in the upcoming 5th test series.
Ecb fastest delivered highlights just wow.. 👍 Brandon macculum effects 😁
Really no doubt Masterclass batting by Pope n root👌🔥💖
I was waiting for this .. thankyou ECB
NZ lacked a quality spinner. I don't know why they aren't choosing Ajaz Patel
10 for Leach, keep it going
Today's my birthday 🎉🎉🎉 and today India will win the match for sure And also England will win
Pope has that Ian bell style of batting 🤩
Leach played awesome Tricky style... Bowl like Bhaji Flighted & gifted for the hit & bats men are Crafted on the Jar... Wow Amazing by Leach
Today was the day of some bizzare shots.. 😂
Where is burns
Leach is a 3rd class bowler ... u will see his mediocre bowling against better teams like india, Australia etc
That run out from Boult when he came like a Bolt and removed the stumps.
Crawley"s time is up.
Root follows stokes and bairstrows rhythm to play fearless cricket and some extraordinary sixes  Leach 5 fer on both innings  after 2-3 years later leach bowling performance challenging lyon 💫
Root and Babar only in two batsman plays very well consistently
it's time to say goodbye to tim southee.
Is this test series Or t-20 series???
Love England Cricket
england at australia loses 5 - 0  england at home wins 3 - 0   🤔🤔🤨🤨
Waiting for One More Century from JOE ROOT.........
Only two batsman plays well in new Zealand in Mitchell and blundell.
mashallah Michael
Watching Cricket being played in England is on next level. The decent clapping sound and cheering style from the crowd during the Test matches is always very attractive and influntial. 👍
This series has kinda given a new life to Test Cricket!
Why have you guys stopped showing DRS replays, ball tracking and stuff? it was the best part of the highlights.
Headingley allways a seamers pitch hence only leech in squad add fact we can use root spin
Who ever was playing wicket keeper for England needs to improve, some of that was shocking
As sublime Mitchell looks while batting, Quite terrible he does while fielding. Been noticing him for fielding misses since last 2 matches. Quite a lot of catches drop and runs leaked at slip even at spin bowling.
England Cricket again like in 2005 keeps test cricket alive with a new style of playing test cricket... Great... What a series...
Pope is a good technical batsman
That 3rd umpire sounds so rude
English fearless cricket change the whole complection of the game
England may win the series, but plz give man of tournament to Daryl Mitchell or Tom blundell 🙏
Test cricket is at it's best..
India ke liye mushkil hoga England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 ko harana
Improve karo highlights yaar isme ball tracking drs kuch nai hai
Why anderson not playing??
Englishtan will demolish kiwis 🔥
Nz give another chance to root score hundred
Bad match for murry status
After 2015 WC England choosed that fearless approach in their ODI Side and now they are arguably the best ODI team in the world,  and now England going with same fearless approach in test matches as well, i won't be surprised if they do wonders in test matches too with this mindset.
I predicted 3-0 at the start and England made it.
England were used to loosing every series in this WTC even in their home also, that now when they won this series against NZ their fans are lke "England is changed, england is next level team etc etc"
Jitni bar highlights dekhta hoon Newzealand ki inning me Tom blundle and derrel Michelle he batting karte hai
Now let's bring Buttler in at the opening pair.👍👍👍👍
Lets just hope day five isn't spoiled by the weather...... should be done and dusted by lunchtime tomorrow eh?
We are coming to win the test series 😂🤣
I love England
From Sri Lanka 🔥
👌👍 This was ❤️Mitchell's memorable series 👍
When England bat well they are almost impossible to beat. Look forward to England closing the match tomorrow before lunch.
In the glut of cricket available to watch these days many people believe Test cricket these days is a thing of the past, dated, and no longer watchable. I say it's unmissable.
That Root six of Wagner. Just demolishing all those old school coaching things
Looking at the current form of the English team, gotta worry for India for the final test.
Jack Leach- The hero England didn't deserve, The hero England needed.
IND v Eng will be a treat to watch🤝🏻
Waiting for india vs england final test match 🔥✨
Love from Dubai
What shoddy editing
England is playing next level cricket
It is One of the best series in the history of test cricket.
The Kop at Anfield and the Western Terrace at Edgbaston are some of the most iconic places in their respective sports. The crowd is just an absolute a joy to watch.
Mcullum completely changed the mindset of England team
Worst you tube channel support only England team
Is it really so difficult to show the DRS on the LBW's?
Don't know why they constantly keep Daryl Mitchell in the slips or gully, his performance there has been awful.
I know there's much time left in his career but wonder what Bairstow might be thinking. Had he been playing like this all over his career he could have broken so many records. He should continue to play like this which is his style of batting.
And here we go again with Mitchel and Blundell.
Always love the highlights from England Cricket Board....Cheers!!!
India is coming for hunt u 😀😀
New Zealand needed their top spinners: Sandhu and Santner
BeN Stokes my Fav ❤️🥀
Drl Mtchl and Tom Blundel are the best partners of this series
England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿❤️‍🔥🤘
England never found the perfect replacement for the chef Aleister cook
This is one special ENG cricket team I'll tell you that for nothing. New coach new captain new mindset. 3-0 COME ON ENGLAND🏏🔥🔥🔥
Pope is a new Ian Bell.
Please don't bring jos buttler back to red ball cricket,  it's way better off him.
whilst england have played really well, new zealand have been sub par this match with none of their top 4 averaging over 30 and only having 3 bowlers and not selecting Patel really hurts their chances of winning. Bracewell just isn't good enough
Crawley needs to go…he’s even getting his own teammates out now!
England team is looking like a complete side💯, They have everything 4-5 Inform betters 4-5 good pace bowlers good all rounders, They Look very dangerous under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, And No word to define Joe Root 🔥, India should be careful 👏 because This England side is not like before that we can easily defeat them
This series Belonge to Blundell and Daryll Mitchell.. The both guys lost the series but wins millions of hearts 💓💓
What a match no........ What a series 🧡
oh my pope!!
Outstanding comeback for England after down early two wickets. Recently Joe root has magnificent form. pope and root built brilliant partnership in day 4. We hope match can be anyone.
9:10 feel for Zak Crawley and Alex Lees. 😭😭.
bhundell nd mitthel 2 players  nz only anyone no responsibility players 9 sheam
Who wants Joe Root 100 . Like .
Can we just take a moment and appreciate ECB? I mean just after stumps they post the highlights..! Unreal!
It's amazing to see Root hit those reverse shots. As easy as you like.
Not test cricket as we knew it, long may it continue  !
Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell- 2 absolute heroes for New Zealand batting attack this series. Anybody would have predicted an early morning collapse for New Zealand but not when these two men are batting. While Pope coming into form looks threatening from an Indian point of view for the upcoming series because he has the ability to turn the match alone with his consistent and systematically paced inning.
Good performance Ollie pope this test series
Good afternoon kumar sangakara
Good batting pope and root
mitchell does unbelievable batting.
What a series we have saw 🔥🔥🔥🔥 It was a amazing series where we saw Joe Root's masterclass in first test match and in second &third we saw brilliant innigs by jonny Bairstow, amazing batting by pope in last 2 matches + Mitchell and blundell batting through out series 🔥🔥and Anderson, board, Jamieson, and all the bowlers well played 🤩🤩, thank you for producing such a wonder new Zealand and England 🤩🤩
Today Root is toying with Bracewell practicing reverse sweep . Worth to watch wht a series love it 💙.
This series can get no better than this🔥🔥
Love chenaal , England and wels cricket 👍👍
A very long awaited series win for us! 🍁
Darryl Mitchell 🔥🛐
Try England to reach upcoming WTC Final(English supporter from Bangladesh)...
Wtf 360 is high quality
Terrific innings from root and pope..  England set to clean sweep nz 🔥🔥
I said it almost 2 years ago, and I am saying it again, this guy Olie Pope is the next big thing in England cricket.
England's fearless approach is brilliant to watch! What a difference Stokes and Mcullum have made..👏👏
Great performance by Leach! Game of his life!
Root is Love 💞
Pakistan zindabad
Congratulations to everyone who saw this comment

Leach the only Frontline spinner playing and what a game changer he has been for 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿. Flights the ball ➡️ teases the batsman to go big  ➡️ Gets the Wicket 🔥. Well Played 👏.
