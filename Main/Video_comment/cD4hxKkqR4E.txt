CZR… 420 🙄
I remember seeing you for the first time in February, and the weather was cloudy and rainy.
0:42 A computer "like this" was unable even to run Windows 3.1.
All those NZ flags and no laser kiwi :(
I had some .tk domains back in the day.
3:30 "... and St Helena" / "Shhh" 😂❤
i was intrigued until the betterhelp sponsor :/
I'm Japanese, but I've never heard the .ninja domain. I wonder who would use it? Ninjas?
We witnessed the American, British and Australian accents in this video!
The reason why ccTLDs exist is to allow countries to manage their own domain name registrations. Without it, we'll all be relying on a single naming registration organisation who had to try to satisfy the needs and demands of every countries on earth. That is in essence going to be the American defaultism again, and we'd just get a fractured internet as countries that want to do their own thing might just develop their own system instead.  With ccTLDs, ICANN doesn't really have to set a policy in regards to how the ccTLDs are administered. Each country are free to manage their ccTLDs as they see fit, whether that's to limit registration to just local entities or to open it up for international registration, those policies are defined by the country's government, not by ICANN.  The point of TLDs or ccTLDs, in essence is to show under whose naming authorities that the website is registered under. ICANN doesn't set any policies regarding to how a top level domain registrar are administered.
is also why we have our .fo 🥰
Fun fact, youtube uses a belgian ccTLD for it's shorthand urls, youtu.be
Early internet devs are notorious for not thinking about the future so shoutout to Postel for thinking ahead
knew its tk
8:32 I was searching for that line “because money, and because money” for so long 😭
Ok video, bad sponsor.
i appreciate the fact you used the old school white and black pattern to indicate am ad break is coming
Fun fact, this is a completely valid URL.  dot.dot.dot.dot
Eleven minutes to give us a two letter answer... This video must be mainly padding, so I won't watch it
9:53 4000 cod sandwiches, I'm surprised you're counting...
Great way to avoid concluding the video. what a crappy piece of content....
Is it lytheria Post watch edit: frig
Why is .com.au over Canada? And where's New Zealand on the Map?
3:12 I'm gonna set this as my ringtone haha! So catchy. Put a smile on my face
🇹🇰
10:30 .cat is catalonia
Oh god now the word flag looks wrong
Es
Non-americans care more about the US than Americans care about them. We can't be asked to care about other countries halfway across the globe when we invent life changing technology.
These guys are seriously funny, or at least funny in the head....  ;o) By the way, dot unicorn can only be used with websites that are wholly mythological.
The second most common tld used in Sweden is Nauru's .nu because "nu" in Swedish means "now."
Should've been Map(dot)Men
.tv calling it
Country codes are useful. They are especially useful for government websites. Any Norwegian should know all government websites end in .no, and that anything else is either unofficial or fake. That does not however mean every website with the correct TLD is safe, just that the wrong TLD can't be trusted.
St Helena…. Shhhhhh… I gotta tell my saint friends that lol
Prediction at 0:06 it's .tv from the country of Tuvalu, a tiny South Pacific Island Nation.
.su is a funny one that still exists
There are also brand TLDs, such as .sncf which was used for a while by the French railway company, SNCF.
Being a Kiwi, I absolutely have heard of Tokelau. Had a friend at school who was from there, and his mum was on the school board.  Another New Zealand protectorate with a very amusing ccTLD (because I am a child) is the Cook Islands (.co.ck).
"Helpfully for our costume budget..."  OK, I had to pause to laugh at that, and then type this. Brilliant!
Kasachstan has the country code .kz which does not work well in german
I smell another history of the entire world i guess .. well done lads. Edit:nvm, betterhelp sponsorship ugh
"Ats us nai!"  Impressive understanding of our colloquialism!
10:37 .Cat is used in Catalonia, although it may be unofficial
Before I watch the video, let me guess. Could it be TV, for Tuvalu? Edit: As a matter of fact, I have heard of Tokelau. Not a lot, but I sure knew of its existence.
I would have thought a pair of diligent map nerds would have made the effort to learn at least one basic fact about Tokelau.  Tokelau is a country. It is also, just like the country of New Zealand, part of the Realm of New Zealand, which is not a country.
9:01 Did you really make a cut one frame late?
Betterhelp is a terrible scam company that preys on vulnerable people. A betterhelp ad gets you an instantly stopped video and unsubscription.
Shame on you for assuming I’ve never heard of Tokelau.
Well, the Internet started in the US was developed in the US was adopted by the US and many registrations in the US pre-date the existence of the country codes.  And even so, at the time the country codes were adopted they were largely for foreign countries.  Nowadays, it’s more prestigious to have a top top level domain is more prestigious than having some country code, tacked on no matter what the country is.
The fact that there was enough communists around to keep the Soviet Union country code around is mind-boggling.  These people never go away and they have to be fought forever don’t they?
Um, Map Men?, BUTTERHELP IS VERY VERY VERY VERY SHADY!!!!
Americans also know what a CV is, but for us those are for college applications, not job applications.
We staan er weer goed op hoor 🇳🇱
Montenegro has over 600,000 people living there, yet there are over 900,000 sites registered to their .ME domain? HA, nice!
.iq is underused, imagine having stuff like "testtoseeyour.iq" or smth like that
.yu was a good idea for websites that wanted to use a shortened version of "you" at the end, too bad yugoslavia used it
Tuvalu .tv
I personally like .ts .pmo and .fr myself.
Thanks for the lore accurate Ukraine map
I'm pretty sure it was dot egg or dot muffin.
Yurp!
It was the beginning of the internet
My favorite tld is .gay
what if mapmen.bgaaaaark was a thing
10:53 London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down, London Bridge is falling down, my fair lady. Bruidld iet aup with irONa BaRas, AiroN Bars, iREODN bAarss, Bruiald It wup wiTh Iroan bwarS, My Faier Lladyq. IRwon--
I use country codes to help with GeoGussr
estrada real mail huh?
if they ever remake that map, anguillas gonna be SO much bigger xd
6:58 that map there is strange.. CAR, Gambia, Mali are way bigger than egypt which is tiny.. they are even bigger than South Africa. And... Us is small too.
haven't watched the video yet, but submitting my guess now: Tuvalu. It's .tv. Pretty sure their economy gets a lot of money from leasing it out  Edit: what is Tokelau
Updates! I just did a little research and there are two mistakes in this video.   .UM for US Minor Outlying Islands hasn't been in use since 2008  Meanwhile, .TK for Tokelau seems to be offering free domains again. I think there was a time where they weren't but it would seem it's back up and running.
How are people going to websites without typing the URL?
btw i tried to check if su.wikipedia.com was a red russian wiki but  it's just the sudanese one
3:39 OR DID IT!?!
6:10  :( no soviet onion
When I first saw .tk i said "Is that Tokelau?" and I was correct
remember guys use adblock till youtube automatically skips commercial segments of the videos when you buy youtube premium i pay for premium but still get ads
Better Help ❌
far too few men
to me GB sounds like gibraltar
love the green screen reveal in 9:01
.onion
they have the same energy as sheldon in fun with flags
Dot cat is for catalan language ;-)
Can anybody help me get a.    Dot NE domain???????
Everyone starts forgetting Belarus more and more
The British Indian Ocean TLD ".io" is also massively popular with tech companies, either run by or selling to nerds, because the acronym "io" appears everywhere in programming meaning input/output
Tryna figure out if I know the answer because I figured it out on my own, or if it’s because I’ve seen the video before 😅
5:27 - I don't know why I didn't react to that AI-generated movement the previous 10 times I've rewatched this vid. Very subtly done... and spooky!
Clippy sees a Betterhelp ad and feels sad
Why is this 3:12 so funny? 😆
Brilliant as always.
Lmaooo I remember I had a .tk domain myself years ago
Future me, is it .tv?
Really? Betterhelp? Damn I thought you guys were cool, guess not.
.gov is the embodiment of US defaultism.
New Zealand mentioned
I don't have tech/IT specialty per se but i can easily identify lots of popular internet country codes, skill issue stuff i fear
Evil Edna!
Another reason there aren't more .us domains is less to do with Americans thinking we're the world's default country and more to do with the fact that if you register a .us domain, your personal information (full name, home address, email address, phone number) immediately becomes publicly accessible on the WHOIS database, where literally anyone can find it, and you will quickly be subjected to spam calls and emails. With almost every other TLD, you can have that information redacted. With .us, you cannot! The US government does not allow it! As such, for most people and small businesses, registering a .us is a bad idea that you shouldn't do.
BTW I'm from dz
5:37 😂
Dot Cat is for the Catalan Websites. It's funny and we love it! =)
that barbecue perfectly describes what betterhelp is
1:35
Future me is it Tuvalu/.tv
I have, in fact, heard of Tokelau
7:43 Lies
It was the beginning of the Internet
.au is actually great as an Australian. It is a sure indication that I’m on the correct version of a website and that information is actually correct for me.  A couple of examples:  If I was purchasing an item I know it’s available to me before finding out in checkout. If I was looking up information on  taxes or legal information; it assures me information is relevant to me.
I’ve never seen a .tk website
The only time I could see a fence like this being a nuisance would be if I had a bunch of farmland, and the farm next door decided they would build a big wall just to cast shade on my field and remove my ability to grow stuff on a large part of my land. This would have to be a HUGE wall, and such basically impossible in practice to do, but I could see that being a legitimate thing to get upset about and you might be able to state a claim there. This lady just nutso
My fav is .ch for Switzerland. The swiss have so many languages, they went with the Latin for it as to not alienate any of the groups.
.tf is French Southern and Antarctic Islands and tf means "the f"
2:23 i was so disappointed after typing that into my address bar
these websites dont work
Hoping the BetterHelp sponsorship is just an old contract, they're quite a scummy company 💀
I like how in the BetterHelp ad, Mark's hair is on fire.
7:45 hey!! i've heard of tokelau!! i can identify it by its flag and shape immediately!! no i don't have autism what are you talking about
2:37 - pretty sneaky sis
People keep asking why we need country codes but as a person who has on multiple occasions looked for services online, found exactly what I'm looking for then after spending ten minutes being impressed just to find out they are a few thousand miles away I want bricks and mortar business's countries to be fairly dominant on their website.
To find United Kingdom codes in a French form is anxiety inducing, never know if it will be GB, UK, Grande Bretagne (Great Britain), Angleterre (England), Royaume Uni (United Kingdom). So literally scrolling and typing for 5min searching for the damn used denomination!
3:39 😂
You guys are brilliant 🙂
Do not use betterhelp, it's a known scam
Song: London bridge is falling down
The website for jon postel doesnt work 😭😭😭
6:22 a really popular csgo cheat once had a .su domain
I have a handful of .TK addresses for testing. They were free!
Wooooow. That SpaceJam website was a throwback.
4000 is way too many people
Arpanet
6:41  I think it’s funny how India is relatively same as in real life
A real hoot these ones are
just started the video, it's either gonna be .io for indian ocean or .tv for tuvalu i can feel it. especially that neither are in the thumbnail
5:42 dont go to this website Its gonna redirec to a bunch of unsafe sites in a redirect chain (which is bad and theyre probably all fingerprinting you or something)
Shameful lack of foresight that .xxx wasn't one of the original domains
Yay
Better help ain’t good
Only just noticed “IBM = Irritable Bowel Movement” in the Glossary of Geeky Terms after my 15th viewing 😂😂😂
5:43 🤣🤣
dont know why but the "its like dad always used to say SHUT UP SON" made me laugh out loud
You forgot .no for norway 😢
Wow, you got the .us one completely wrong. It is not used because by US law, anyone without a .us domain can't redact any of their registration information from the ICANN list. With a .com you can redact all your information like Name, Address, phone number, ect.
Thank you, after watching your video I went to check one of the ccTLDs and found out that a domain I wanted was available (it hasn't been in the last 15 years and I lost hope to get it)
BetterHelp is actually a quite horrible company, and you should please stop using them as one of your advertisers.
.tv
0:38 tbh i want that waffle making machine
I have heard of Tokelau!
2:37 LAZER KIWI?
9:49 wasn't expecting these two Brits to support Sardinian indipendence
Y U NO .MAPMEN
As a Brit watching one of your videos for the first time, your jokes resonated so well with my sense of humour that I almost disintegrated. You have earned a like and a subscriber. Bravo! Let us all rejoice!
This type of videos is why I pay my internet bills for
"It took the driving in another country stickers people decades to catch up" -  Technically it took the DVLA :D  decades to declare they wanted to use UK
The URL at 11:13 currently (June 5th, 2025) points to adware. Don't visit it.
hi! at 5:23 and added in the maps shortly after, northern ireland is placed as ".uk" , this is true for a lot of cases however for important addresses like government websites or other social services we use ".ni.uk" ... northern ireland / the north of ireland has always been and will always be awkward in things like this :p
Betterhelp is a zionist terrorist company that will sell your data to Israel and US
5:42 I'm disappointed you guys didn't register that domain and have it redirect to this video.
no .io mention is crazy, great vid tho except for the sponsor
+10 points for a good video, but -5 points for accepting a sponsorship from betterhelp. 5/10
Better help is a scam.
The internet reaches nearly 4k people? What a time to be alive. 😂
the editing of this video is top notch! bravo
3:13 ISO 3166-1 🤤
It's so sad Brits just can't live without "Russia bad" bits.
.sexy💀💀💀💀🚡🚡
Your usual reminder that BetterHelp is absolutely not the company anyone should be going to. They HAVE and WILL exploit your mental health needs for money.
7 and a half minutes to get the answer to the title of the video AND a betterhelp ad! Never post again!
Please sponsor Betterhelp no longer, I'm sure you know why by now.
I guessed it before clicking the video. I want a cookie
Playin' the same domain name fame game
Loved the Postel caricature.
Is it British Indian Ocean?
catchy domains are important for offline advertisement. Especially when you target drivers for example. They can't scan QR code + QR codes sometimes doesn't work. But catchy or obvious domain will be memorized for some time and manually typed in later. In cases of shopping platforms I tend to type them in manually in about 95% cased, though I let the auto complete do it's job. But in case of google I often find myself googling for google in my browsers search bar just so I can click the button to switch to maps or image search from there.
7:32 bonzi buddy
Fun fact Tuvalu getting .tv was the only reason they could afford to join the United Nations
9:53 Does he even like cod sandwiches? Or is he a gym bro?
We don't have a country code cuz we're the best!
Love your videos guys, I learn so much through my tears of laughter.
Is that London bridge is falling down at the end?
Have I just found the show that inspired Fun with Flags?
4:01 real men real men real real real men men
Funny little fun fact: Tuvalu's revenue generated from selling the .tv ccTLD makes this internet sale one of its biggest (if not, the biggest) export there
im going to go out on a limb and say tuvalu
4 thoughts is too many thoughts for 1 me to process
My guess before watching the video: .to for Tonga
“Internet will come at you like wasps” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
4:59 skip to part 2
10:20 i am painfully reminded that the average user has never seen a terminal
.tv
.com.br in Russia?!
first guess, is vanuatu
i found the word s3x1
3:13 is so catchy, that i think it might just become my notification ringtone
The UK actually used yoo-kay-dot, as illustrated in the image shown. My own was uk.ac.ukc which didn't lead to confusion at all, especially when it all switched around. Another fun fact: Before DNS, all the hostnames were kept in a big file which was passed around. It still exists as a vestigial but working file /etc/hosts on Linux and Windows has its own version buried down deep.
Would be .tk
4:15 I think this is the first homemade green screen I’ve seen with mostly correct proportions.
yeah and i still dont know the most popular one...
3:39
What is Torquay
Disliked for the atrocious outro song
Before I even watch the video, I’m gonna guess it’s .jp
Happy divorce party 💀💀💀
Lots of people get surprised that .co doesn't mean "Company" but "Colombia" 🇨🇴
[3:27] Jay: USMOI Mark: *um*                                                                   this was my favorite part
hungary is missing from the soviet union map...?
somehow, i got this video's comment section on a heavy metal trailer and was very confused as to why they were sponsered by better help
'State of Canada' - well that aged well...
It's io, isn't it?  Edit: what o.o
Got in big trouble for my website ending in .fuk no not because of the swearing but because it was too similar and potentially misleading to .uk
This reliance on Internet country codes is probably why Trump imposed tariffs on an island populated by only penguins. Dweebs!
3:13
No .io mentioned 🥀
It turns out, this is the map that Trumps administration seems to have used for working out their list of countries to apply tarrifs to in 2025... the muppets.
Good old numbers and dots. Back at high school in 2005 we all knew the numbers and dots for new grounds and miniclip so even though the site addresses were band we could still play. Helps when you have a hacker in your year 😅.   We also all played unreal tournament on lan, because the lad that hacked hacked the main server at school and brought in a USB of the game. So every computer in the school had the game and we all played it on LAN. Great times.
Is it .tv for tuvalu?
5:29 - I know the joke of this bit is that it's Mark in Jay's place, but why is the camera also stabilized around his forehead? Is this part of the joke?
Haven't watched the video and never will. The answer is .tv which is Tuvalu's internet code.
1:40 Pixelated Mark Jumpscare
yeah fusa
The musical outro reminded me of the live sketch Jay did years ago where he sang and played a tune a bar out of sequence. 😎👍 Great work guys.
I love the Tokelau Telecom phonebox 🤣
TV, Tuvalu.  edit: Well it was a decent guess
ie on Iceland in the thumbnail annoys me
My guess is .tv for tuvalu.
7:30 yeah that depiction of the American world view aged very well .
Jon had every right to take that list as it was meant for Postel purposes anyway.
Hey, I‘ve heard of Tokelau!
Disliked get a better sponsor
Thumbnail has a mistake, .au is the Australian ccTlD
sheldon cooper and amy farah fowler presents sheldon cooper's fun with flags
Wait what is this hilarious channel and how have I never seen it before
8:46 DANKPODS song?!
map men map men map map map men men men men....... men I could hear that thumbnail before I even clicked it
Hmm, cool. I did give it two thoughts, but not 3, so I didn't know that .tv and others came from countries.
6:44 the borders on cz-at-pl are perfect
That song at the end makes my ears feel like they got slapped.
"It might as well be random letters and numbers"  onion sites:
Bruh 4:19
I had in fact heard of Tokelau. Misinformation
"bok bok bok"
the niche category of 'foreign' XD
love that new zealand has six flags when searched
the scheme isn't part of the host name
imma predict .tv
Hi, internet from 1,000,002,024 AD :)
2:23 It's My Country!
7:47 actually i guessed it because i knew that tokelau exists
0:37 old samsung tv sound but low pitched
Ew, the BetterHelp sponsor didn’t age well.
the fact that https://www.hereliesjonpostelsuchalovelyandclevermanmissedbymany1943-1998.com/rest/in/peace isn't a real site saddens me
0:38 sounds like the old Samsung TV startup
1:19 i think that's actually markiplier
10:40  bok bok bok bok bok
Everyone: has normal internet domains UK: .gb or .uk?
0:08 why is the texture map on that globe so terrible
Hey im from nz, you guys are so read up, 2:35 thrse guys know about my tiny country of 5 million having an identity crisis?
thought it was tuvalu
the first websites "men" are actual websites...
.co.ck 😝😝😝🇨🇰😈😈😈
Four thousand whole people?  Jeepers!
Nice video
XK for Kosovo.
5:05 THE KES FILM PHOTO IN THE TOP AND THE MOVIE KES WAS FILMED IN BARNSLEY WHERE I AM FROM
Its so sad that ppl dont do research abt betterhelp
😢plese post more regularly please🙏
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:42 That very long domain is actually up for sale. And it's on sale for the extremely low price of $2.800.
7:37  Tokelau? I have heard of it because  it’s beautiful flag 🇹🇰
Hurray for .ca , our own country, and not a state!
Start: Saying everything in .coms
I did hear of TK, for this is a second time im watching this video
7:29 France 😂😂
INTERNETTY
10:40 you forgot .monster😡😡😡
4:21 STAMPY
So I'm guessing no one mentioned "pen island" as a tld?
Nobody has decided to talk about the awfully amazing song at the end
i’ve heard about tokelau
Gotta disagree with the assertion that TLDs of any variety are irrelevant or useless. Otherwise good video imo.
Let me guess, either .tv (Twitch for example) or .be (only because of YouTube)
50% Comments: yo i agree with this man’s topics this is so co- 50% Comments: DUDE SHUT UP I DONT WANNA HEAR ABOUT BETTER HELP AGAIN WHY DID YOU SPONSOR IT BRUHHHHHHHHH
postel code
6:46 India just cryin' in the corner
3:45 I got an ad XD
Another reason why .us is not as popular other than usians thinking they are the default country is that to register you need to be an us citizen (or entity from it or in its territory)
5:00
this was made more than a year ago? i thought it was only a couple months ago
.cat is not referring to the fluffy animals, its the domain Catalonia is using
my guess is tuvalu's ".tv"
What's with the awful London Bridge Is Falling Down?
hmmm ru should be wayy bigger with all those pirate sites
I think it's funny this video has at the moment op typing a total of 4369 comments, which should be 369 more comments than that guy expected a total number of internet users
i thought it was going to be tuvalu
this series always been comfort food to me, brilliant work
3:40 so minor islands that aren't countries are fine but Georgia, Armenia & Azerbaijan was just cleanly wiped off? nice
5:42 how come no-one has claimed that url yet?
i guessed it, its .tv because of tuvalu
7:30 hold on a min is this where Trump got the idea of trying to make Canada a state?
5:02 why THE FUCK is there USSR on the map signed with ".ru"? 😭😭😭
3:39 what’s tht blue and white thing in the top corner
Black men
8:19 please use proper Indian map 🇮🇳
is the answer dot ru? probably is
https://youtu.be/cD4hxKkqR4E?t=217 why does Iceland and Israel have .is, israel should be .il
without watching i'm just gonna guess its the US and Tuvalu
I guessed it
why does this video look like it was made like 7 years ago or something?
7:30 Wait, do they not know Africa? This'll make for perfect material for a science paper. 9:54 It’s a short form of „Curriculum Vitae“.
Betterhelp is a scam
THAT IS FAKE NEWS I DID KNOW IT WAS TOKELAU I GOT YOU
0:05 I’m here and I can tell without the video that it should be .tv which is Tuvalu.
one thing, the url should not be nonesense, bc for example youtube does not have a "watch video outside playlist" button, so i tend to just remove the &list part of the url. similarily if a website's search bar is not well displayed and i cant figure out how to get to it (which has happened) i just test if adding /search to the main site's url works. so having a sensible (non random) url is important, atleast in certain cases.
"the internet will just come at you like wasps" is one of the most prescient predictions I've heard about the future of the internet
9:53  .nu is also used in Sweden.
4:23 no ine knew that betterhelp was a scam
I can't remiss but to notice you said ".cat" at the end of the video, but that actually stands for the Catalonia region of spain. I hoped you guys notice something like that, since well it's kinda map related.
Boooòó for you and better help
Outdated:in Australia its is now just .au
.edu is 3rd most popular since 2016 because of Scratch the kids coding website
Whatever's happened with the jon postel link at 5:43? Looks like it's down
Toby le Squids here. What are you doing with my CV?
better help is a site that takes advantage of vulnerable people
Is it tuvalu? I'm genuinely guessing I'm commenting before watching
betterhealth? yikes
Awesome vids, keep them coming ❤
3:39 woah (°ロ°)
6:33 worth mentioning that WoT website has .SU code
You forgot .co.ck!
1:43 I CANNOT BE THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT SMTH ELSE😭😭😭
Bold of you to assume I have not heard of Tokelau!!
I *have* heard of Tokelau! Because it had two very silly UN-sponsored referendums in one year on changing from a New Zealand territory to "a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand", which was almost exactly the same thing in practise but would have officially taken Tokelau off the UN list of last remaining colonies.  There were only about 800 voters spread around a very wide archipelago and the UN officials had to zip around on motor boats delivering ballot boxes.  The first vote got 60% in favour and the second vote got 64% in favour, but for no particular reason they had set a two-thirds rule to accept the new status, so it lost and the whole thing ended up being a huge waste of everyone's time.
I wonder what British territories St. Helena, Tristan Da Cuhna, and Bermuda played in WWII,, specifically the Atlantic War against Germany. There is SO LITTLE information about the 3 as it applies to WWII.
3:39 OR DID IT?!?!
please check if the company sponsoring you is trustworthy and doesnt have a history of lying to their consumers about the safety of their data.
2:37 very funny NZ flag reference
Oi you funny MF.  I think it’s time for another upload. Chop chop. I know you have got the yute to care for and all that. 99% of us have to work 9 to 5 and look after the yutes.   I’ll expect a new upload within a week or so.   Chop fucking chop.  King regards
Why aren't phone area codes the same as post zip codes?
.baaark.tv
jokes on u ive heard of tokelau
7:47 Joke's on you, I have heard of Tokelau, because I have already watched this video a million times!
0:39 why the waffle maker?
As a New Zealander I froze when I saw the referendum flags omg, because we all know which flag won… LAZER KIWI 2:37

Here from the twitter post to look at 5:42 and go "ooh, that's clever"
9:08 map
10:40: I read ".butthole"
Companies from the cook islands use the best one
Pen Iceland
to think .AI is probably so much bigger now
This is about to get interesting since the British Indian Ocean Territory is getting handed to Mauritius, and .io is really big
It’s not that hard. It’s Cook Islands, aka Co.ck. I think we know why this is popular.
This is the best channel on YouTube.
7:46 i actually have, when i was eight i used to think it was a country
5:29 his shirt is blue 5:48 his shirt is black
To be fair when computers looked like a IBM PC the World Wide Web didn't exist for about 10Years that means you didn`t had Browsers at all
They crack me up everytime
7:46 “neither have you”.  Yes, I have. I used to have a .tk domain many years ago
0:37 the waffle maker machine 💀
Ha! Yours is the only channel where I don't fast forward through the sponsored ad.
aqua teen hunger force at the end
I love this channel!
Education with fun.
7:47 i did hear about it and recognized the shape and domain name (cuz i know all 260 countries and territories on a map, all the 260 flags, 260 shapes (outlines basically) and 260 capitals)
PAID PARTNERSHIP!!!!!!!! 4:19
More maps, less trends.
I once had a website which had a .tk country code. That was one of the ones you could register for free and from anywhere in the world
amazing episode just i hope you stopped doing betterhelp promotions
That outro is FIRE 🔥
Fascinating! I didn't know the Libyan connection with .ly Thanks, you nutty MapMen!
You should've mentioned the .io games.
9:52 the pinnacle of Now albums
I see your Game Gear and to that I say gg.
Is it .co.ck?
5:28 Are you using deepfake Mark?
My surname is in the comments.
Hey i have heard of Tokelau, when i was looking for a free domain name.
The radio station at my university pays to use the letters of the Federated States of Micronesia so they can be under the domain .fm. I think it’s kinda cool.
Time to revisit?

Pity DNS doesn't have the governance of country dialing codes
You didn’t explain why the UK is not actually .uk but .co.uk. I’ve always wondered that and doing a Google search would take at least five seconds of my life.

I watch this both because it’s interesting, but also just for the intro.
youtu.be/brzxpcy_2co has no video but was it?
please try to vet sponsors next time. betterhelp is beyond sketchy and it's pretty much common knowledge
As a German i never thought about why an that .de is so big
Pozdrowienia z Polski od Szumiego!
Before the video: .tv bc it’s Tuvalu and they profit off it
You referred to .cat as nonesense but that is wrong, it has a purpose, it was actually requested by the catalan government and it is officially recognized as the internet code for the catalan linguistic and cultural community. It is also used by the catalan institutions and government.
Better Help is useless in Finland because of the saying "A Finnish man doesn't cry"

What about .ae      Which is for the UAE
It's mad.

there are a lot of non-country country codes that were missed in the video, Åland .ax is one.
.me is also used in the middle east (don't need to explain why)
0:01 The website is real.
7:47 Tokelau and Samoa can both be used to date maps because the international date line shifted from one side of them to the other in 2012.

And after inventing the TLD he also created the lesser known tl;dr
2:58 there was even one for the soviet union (it was never used, not one time) edit: NVM. the guys talk about it later in the video
Map map men men
Don’t take better help as a sponsor  Look them up first
The fact the link at the beginning redirects to this very video is just hilarious
do you guys have to re-record the head spin in every video?
.tv?
mi mayor deseo es que haya un gordo compu que sepa porque en argentina se usa tan poco el .ar 🤞🤞
❤
We just gonna ignore they havent taken the sponser out yet...
Literally everyone heard of Tokelau. You're just stupid.
Why does germany have the most uses tho
Dear gawd! That music at the end is outstanding!
That's right, you invent it, your country is the default. Like how the UK is the centre of the world because UK people invented longitude.  Okay, there's no way latitude should be centred on the UK, that wouldn't make sense.
TLDs are not limited to latin script anymore either ! 😉
Apparently the .io country code has very dark origins because that's the code for the British Indian Ocean Territory, which has some messed up history. Fredo Rockwell made a well-researched video on it.
9:50 sonic moment (there's a game gear at the corner)
Beef butter?
9:24 people who thought .tv was just a TLD for twitch
Your beef with how America handles contry codes is no different than timezones and "UTC" go ahead and guess where that's located.
guess: anguela maybe since ai
5:24 ats us nai 😂
7:49 How dare you assume I haven’t heard of Tokelau. My 7th grade social studies teacher made sure I knew it
You forgot .nl
.ninja is a real thing? :0
I always used to wonder as a young man, what kind of humorous dry witted stoic weirdos become Cartographers? 🤔 Yes. Well. Here we are.
10:53
my guess is .io
Is it the Cook Islands?
ok     noice
i expected .onion lol
Defunctries   My new fave word
2:37 perfect opportunity to have included New Zealand’s infamous evil laser kiwi flag
Fuck betterhelp. Shame on you for accepting their ad money. They take advantage of vulnerable people. FUCK them.
this video does a better job of explaining DNS on a surface level than my cybersecurity degree program
Get help but get better sponsor, you should be ashamed of yourself
That's the most subtle NZ change the flag dig I've seen yet lol
Only absolute failures want the soviet union back.
Domain name SERVICE
This bloke made web addresses before the web?
8:41 Ich bin in Deutschland, aber ich bin so allein
Better Help are charlatans and scammers why do people accept sponsorships from them??
Is that a screen from the good old Amstrad CPC I see @1:18?
Better Help is a scam. Created by former IDF soldiers as well. You guys are a lovely and very funny, but you should really drop them as a sponsor.
"And the internet will just come at you like wasps."  This is a future I can see happening.
ZUURBIER- what a name! 99% convinced it's a fake name/pseudonym  (zuur bier means sour beer)
dot cat is not for the pets, it's for Catalonia in Spain
was it .tv I haven't watched but Its totally .tv
Wait isn't Montserrat that mountain range in catalonia Spain
10:34 .cat is actually the ccTLD for Catalonia/unya/uña (already appeared in map men before :))
Thank you, guys. Because of you, I started to use BetterHelp, and it really changed my life for the better. I can only recommend it to everyone watching
If Map Men chooses to accept money from the sham company Better Help, then i guess i have to choose to stop watching their videos. Integrity should be top of the list for such a popular educational YouTube channel.
Fun fact: the url at 5:42 is an actual registered url, owned by presumably Jay, with actual real content on it. You should check it out!

Where can I find that beautiful outro song? I need the full version!
Saint Helena sh oh sorry saint helena hahaha that’s the funniest bit I’ve sent in ages u guys are mint ❤much love from 🇸🇴🇸🇴
Which was the most popular coubtry code? I stopped watching when the Betterhelp sponsorship came.
In Sweden, Denmark and dutch speaking countries, .nu of Niue is popular because it means "now"
Could anyone tell me the name of the tune playing during the Better Help ad?  I know it from somewhere, but I can't place it.
lmao ats us nai
"Yeah who cares about borders and laws and stuff"
5:00 Advert skip incase you don’t want to hear about the terrible company Betterhelp
I want one of those new TLD, so I can start my.bunghole website.
3:42 Nice little Granada/ATV vibe going on there.
It was the beginning of the Internet
Wow that guitar duo at the end was amazingly together. Well done guys! That must have been challenging.
Skip ad 5:00
And everybody piling in with your sponsorship complaints, like who gives a shit man. Map Men gotta eat. Your not fixing anything by whinging in the YouTube comments.
These dudes straight up make me laugh out loud more consistently than anything else I’ve seen in years
.tv obviously
I appreciate you taking the time to create the website on the gravestone.
a shame you didn't mention the funniest TLD in the world: .vlaanderen
i thought it was tuvalu .tv
i remember back in 2006/2007 when .nu was the most popular cctld
stop taking better help sponsorships
2:54 North Korea Spotted! 💀

Sponsorship ends at 4:58
i love you guys and your videos but i managed to notice you guys reading a script behind the camera now i cant unsee it
I’m gonna put my predictions in before the video starts: it’s either .tv, .fr, or .mx
I live in the Philippines so... .ph I didn't even look until I did.
i'm gonna guess tuvalu
My favorite one is .moe
Why does the UK always use Colombia's country code before theirs????
its .ai and .tv from tuvalu and angola I think?
But what's .tools other than ny favorite 5e site (D&D)
cool
2:24 i just wanted to see some flag so i put in the url but i got redirected to corn hub😭😭😭
i feel like i should've paid to watch this
Better give me your private information help
BH is just exploiting desperate people that really need professional help. They're just an Indian call center wanting your money
oh yikes please don't use betterhelp ;-; they're really quite terrible, love the video tho
0:38 - What waffle maker on the right is?
No please tell me the betterhelp sponsorship is satire. Please. You cannot not know all the reasons not to work or use betterhelp in 2024
So whats so special about Veterans administration - VA Medical Centre?
2:37 Ha Six flags for my country
Computer Science, Cyber Security Engineer, and instructor here.  WOW guys didn't think you'd delete my comment informing how you guys were almost correct.  Don't like accurate information being listed that contradicts what you said huh?
betterhelp is a scam
As a computer guy my thought that the .tk being popular was some how related to the tk gui widget toolkit.
Before watching nor knowing what is really about imma bet on '.etc'
why ugly betterhelp ad
Guys are we gonna talk about co... cook islands?.
Is it .tv?
I guessed sorry
Hmm I just learned something about my early days on the internet.  From 2001, I hosted a Website for my CounterStrike clan. Being a poor student, and the rest of the founding members similar. There was no way, I was able to spend money on it. Renting a game server, was expensive enough. So I used a free hosting site, and found a site, that let you create free .tk domains, and use it to redirect to where ever your Website was hosted. So for some years we had our *four letter clan tag*.tk . It was great. The clout of having that domain, made it so much easier to build a community around the clan, and get prospects. Until everyone else started using the same service, that is.  Side note. That website was my first babysteps into programming. And 10 years later, I decided to become a software developer. So that time brings back some fond memories.
Have to be honest and say this was awful. Poorly written jokes, just dripping with sarcasm and smugness.
Cook islands: ck, add co. Then its co.c-
In the case of .cat, it isn't actually named after cats, but its actually used for websites that are in catalan
Congratulations! You’ve won the prize for YouTube channel that make me pause and read the most while still enjoying every minute of it!
.tv.
The mary had a little lamb in all the scales at the end 💀
1:09 Postel, Czech = bed. Carry on.
Funfact: This video has kinda bad timing since Freenom (the operator of .tk) actually was de-accredited and is longer allowed to operate the domain name, this means the domain name is no longer free, since the new operator takes a fee
Guernsey got mentioned, finally I can rest.
my favorite cctld is .tf because most of the websites with that domain name are related to Team Fortress 2. i find it very funny that a single video game can hijack a country code so people can trade hats easier
Cool
Love the outro!

this is the same as fun with flags from the big bang theory
2:00 We're getting there folks. When I signed up, I was told I'm the 3998th user
Fun fact: 9% of Tuvalu's entire GDP comes from their .tv country code.
its Tuvalu? (won't watch the vidéo)
9:25 OMG WILLO THE WISP!!!?!?!?!!  It took me a full minute to even place that image. I had to google it just to be sure. That's dragged things out of my memory I didn't think existed anymore.  Gosh, I feel old now.

Good video, not sure about your sponsor though 😮
Supporting a "therapy" service that hires unqualified therapists... 😮
.unicorn is not a tld (yet)

What about the .cat from Catalonia that’s three letters
I had registered a free .tk domain for my blog about twenty years ago! Though when I stopped blogging I never renewed it.
I am commenting #BringBackDislikes on every unique YouTube video that I watch for the rest of 2024, regardless of if I actually dislike the video or not. This is video 1473.
"Defunctries" beautiful
.TV and .io are the most popular
i love the outro song
all computer nerds know .tk is free back then
5:41 It makes me so happy that someone spent $10 dollars to actually make this.
9:04 "It's our fault not Tokelau's"
did you just called gTLDs COUNTRY CODES??!?!?!
Fun fact: .tk allows emojis in the url.
Hello there .se
I was just going to search a ".su" site :( 6:25
Türkiye is almost island if you really want to call it and don't like to be called Turkey if you're not living under the rock. 7:40
5:42 OMFG THE SITE IS REAL I LOVE YOU GUYS
6:22 actually in russia we have a bunch of cites where we can watch anime for free and one of them has domain ".su" which makes the whole name of the cite "jutsu". and yes, this cite became popular because of Naruto)
not many videos have me hooked like this one
Either .tv or .th
i swear this used to have a different thumbnail
10:35 "new non-sensical tlds have flourished and they are now not limited to 3 letters, such as .cat" yeah.. that one is NOT one of the new "non sensical" ones, that stands for Catalonia and it's required that the website is either in catalan or about catalan culture.
I will, it is .tv from tuvalu.
No, .cat isn't actually the same kind of stuff as .ninja or .pizza : it's Catalonia :)
.tv? Tuvalu? Locking in my guess before I watch. I bet I'm wrong.
Why the end music is so familiar 🤔
If ccTLDs must be 2 letters, The maximum number of ccTLD is 676, right? From .aa to .zz, 26 X 26 = 676
before I continue, it's io
Again, If it took you 11 min : 14 sec to watch the episode, then you are not a real fan 😂😂😂
The music at the end of this video never fails to make me laugh. The progression of the guitar rendition of London Bridge is Falling Down from pleasant to desperately out of sync is a seriously impressive form of aural humour and I still don't entirely understand what exactly about it is funny.
wonder if they included my DE TLD
I remember having .tk domains 😅 Years before I could afford actual domains, it was very cool.
Good video but I disliked for the BetterHelp ad
And .pl
You know, country domains are quite useful because contrary to the opinions of English speaking world, not all websites are in English.
i thought DNS is a Domain Name Server and not Domain Name System
Wow, why so many codes in my Dutch country? We only have 17 million people living here. Compared to the amount of people in Germany or the UK we should have a much smaller representation on this map. So somehow the Dutch code is probably also used a lot for outside traffic.
The US IS the default though, if you dont like, go make your own internet <3
0:33 brilliant. It's interesting that you didn't mention that ICANN is technically part of the United States Department of Commerce.
it probably be .su of sovet unon.
I guessed it. Was expecting tuvulava
Tuvalu.
this video reminds me of OG youtube
sponsored by better help is atrocious
haha, joke's on you! I've heard about tokelau because I live in NZ and we have tokelau language week
all the proposed nz flags tho
i knew it was tokelau, ive heard of it, i know everything about it.
.bumhole💀
"Stored on the DNS" is a metaphor that sort of bugs me because it makes it seem like it is one place (it's not), but I suppose it's no worse than thing stored on "The Cloud."
I guessed that it would be .tk. The video title lied to me. I want my money back. And also a prize.
.tv final guess
2:56 PHILIPPINES SPOTTED
I need an extended cut of the outro music.
Let me guess it's Tuvalu 🇹🇻
.cat contrary to popular belief, was not added for please cat lovers but instead strangely for the autonomous community of Spain Cataluña
'the internet will just come at you like wasps' is a brilliant phrase
The internet already just comes at you like wasps tbh
.TV maybe?
* list of TLDs scrolls past * Me: Wait, did I just see chicken noises!?  Turns out there also the chorus of Witchdoctor hidden in there as well 🤣 Well played
Fun fact: the .nu domain is no longer handled by Niue. Since a few years back, the Swedish Internetstiftelsen (who handles Swedens .se domain) now handles the .nu domain, because (as the Mapmen briefly mentioned), Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands have the most sites registered with the .nu. I'm not sure exactly why Sweden got to take over it rather than any of the others countries that use .nu.
I wonder, what is this internal joke of Jay for putting that beef butter advert in so many videos? Prolly just a easter egg, but still
is it .tv or .ms?
pahe*.li sindu*.me yts*.lt yts*.pe (?) yts*.mx yts*.rs yts*.je yts*.ag adf*.ly (frickin sucks) aka*.ms drv.*ms
6:25 he read my mind😂
Guys... Love your videos, but BetterHelp...? Seriously?
Wow
.io
Sad you sisnt mention that there exist one сyrillic domain .рф
Guys never done a single illegal thing on the Internet 😄
Anyone else spend ages doing pause play to read all those text boxes with countries that sell theirs?
It's so weird to realize that Soviet Union had a country code
One of the few channels where the ads are debatably funnier than the actual content.
So, CCTLDs were added in 1985 to prevent the standard TLDs being swamped by too many websites, which were invented 5 years later (ish)
nz having 6 flags is fucking hilarius
5:42 he commit to the bit well done
I appreciate you blokes recognizing the USA as THE default country which is factually correct 👍
I feel like I've seen this before
Isn't Betterhelp the company that sold all its customer private medical information to Facebook for marketing?
Wait wdym .br isn't the default? 😭😭😭😭
I just had an ah ha moment.  I realized how languages change over time.   He said defunct countries. Defunctries. 😂  That’s how English was developed.  I’m from southern US and we drop as many syllables as possible.  😂  It all makes sense now!
shame on using better help
Hey, I knew about tokelau and not even because of the ccTLD thing. It is considered one of the most remote places on earth, with outside boat connections coming just a few times per month. Once read about a doctor going there for service.
"I've never heard of Tokelau, and neither have you."  -how poorly you underestimate my nerdiness.
If you type in the adress on Jon Postels gravestone, you actually end up on a page that someone created.
DNS is here to stay. Noone wants to type IPv6 addresses.
How is this an 11 minute video?  Edit: how did you keep me entertained and enthralled for 11 minutes talking about cc-tld’s. Bravo.
7:32 And here I assumed it related to TikTok
Also last year, Google Registry bafflingly decided to introduce .mov and .zip domains, blurring the line between local zip and mov files (C://mydocuments/file.zip) and websites (http://c.mydocuments.file.zip). Their defence? Since Windows hid file extensions by default some years ago most people don't even know what they're clicking on anyway. Masterful.
Yes Americans think everywhere is a state of America except Australia which they think is in Europe.
Who else remembers the turn-of-the-century TRAVEL.TO / GO.TO forwarder?  Kingdom of Tonga for the win!
never have you...    iloa au o te motu o tokelau
5:41 Amazing that is an actual working domain. Props for the dedication.
Free Palestine
I use .TK myself and i want IT back
ahhh i was gonna guess .tv but yeah it's .tk because that one's free @7:37
yet another channel corrupted by betterhelp
Obligatory better help is a scam
wish those .tk domains still exist
7:46 Lol I have, New Zealand (My country of residence) owns it
Bloody internet is already coming at me Like wasps.sting.no.not. the . musician.ouch.stung
I used to have a .tk it was a low grade Wrestling RPG forum site,  God.. it was shit
ha
IBM => Irritable Bowel Movement 😂
NO NO NO NO NO, PEOPLE NEED TO STOP TAKING FUCKING BETTERHELP SPONSORS
that outro song's arrangement is gold
'The niche category of 'foreign' lol...
Ai.google and maps.ai? Hmm.
You know you're a geography nerd when you've heard of Tokelau
C:
Defunctries is a solid portmanteau
Better help is problematic, map men gotta check their sponsors!!
Cook Islands TLD is .ck, but have “.co” behind it. So there TLD is .co.ck
I realized the thumbnail got changed.
Every one of their videos need to be watched twice - once for the content and the second time at half speed (and with frequent use of the pause) to read all the very clever visual jokes (such as the words for the witch-doctor song in the fast-scrolling list of new TLDs).
Please make the Mapmen president of the USA and PM of the UK and also make them Dames or Baronesses or something
My guess is Tuvalu
Funny Men Change Picture -Cave Men
Man, I miss the days of having a waffle maker as computer peripheral. Nothing goes better with spread sheet than Belgium waffles.
Oh no Jay. I thought you were above better help!
True fact: I am working for a hospital that uses the last two octets of the IP address as part of the hostname, but with a bajillion different standards for what comes before it. The result is that it is actually easier to remember the IP address...
10:38 "oooh" "eeee" "ooohahhahh" "ting" "tang" "wallahwallah" "bing" "bang" 👀
predicted apple vision pro at the end
8:38 Why does it sound like I'm A-B testing headphones
I love the song at the end
Secret code at 3:39  (not country code)
UK on the map is way to big... They have only a handful domains, like co.uk, nhs.uk, gov.uk, ... the rest are all subdomains.
ffs, stop accepting better help money, they are terrible!
Postman pat and his......
To be precise: before introducing hierarhical system it wasn't called DNS (just host file) and domains didn't has a .com at the end. Also it was before websites.
i honestly thought it would be greenland because of google's goo(dot)gl shortener
i really want to use the .cat domain, but its actually made for catalan language preservation, so i technically cant register a .cat domain unless i can find a way to give my website language options and include catalan
Ew betterhelp supports genocide
😂 🤣 Gents you're great!
I love Map Men and I really want another episode 🎉🎉🎉
Ugh, not betterhelp. Heh, a funny rendition of London Bridge.
Some websites from Toronto use .to (Tonga) as their domain name.
Ats us Nai
Hilarious
TLD(R)  Money does wonderful things. "I like the colors of your country flag, let me buy it for random use."
I can't wait for the next one. They are a real treat!
7:47 Jokes on you I have >:) (I love countries)
Binge watching Map Men videos should come with a Govt Health Warning... one can hurt laughing so much.
I always love your videos😂
Jon Postel was only 55? 😢
Absolutely brilliant. Informative and funny
taking a guess before watching: .tv of Tuvalu
Oi Peasants ... where's the next video?  🤪
I find it hard to believe that .tv isn't way higher
B
I was entirely expecting Tuvalu to have the most out of all of the country domains. It was even a plot point in a book series I was reading that the main villain was taking over Tuvalu BECAUSE of the revenue it got from .tv domains
Interestingly enough Niue, whose name was .nu means “now” in other country’s present in Northern Europe and is owned by a Swiss company which is their biggest country code and are gatekeeping the profits. The Niuean government have been actively attempting to get .nu back for a few decades since they estimated they have been missing out in 176 million dollars.
The map at 3:30 and its other versions are all missing the ax domain in the Baltic sea
Stopped watching as soon as I saw you had accepted money from a disgusting company like betterhelp. Hope youre enjoying that money, bye bye!
Nowadays, in Finland, new websites prefer to use Internet addresses with ".com" ending rather than the ".fi" ending intended for Finland, because, according to the explanations,  it is more international and less nationalistic country-specific addresses. However, I have never heard that any of the other countries complained that their country-specific addres ending would be too nationalistic.
The incompetent clowns at ICANN sure did a good job making a complete mess of the whole tld system
@JayForeman come back I miss you and Mark
Missed opportunity to call them Postel Codes.
Rethink your sponsor …
Why isn’t it map men anymore
huh i was almost positive it would be .tv so i almost didnt bother watching the video but good thing i did!
the websites they say at the start actually exist
Im dutch, and i dont know why are country code is used by so many people even more than france!
Where new video
It’s tuvalu  Edit: I guess I was technically correct?
Tuvalu, easy.    Edit: Tokelau? Wtf? Edit 2.0: Theres tuvalu, and libya
Forgot about better help being a crap company again, did we?
I guess .tv for Tuvalu
As an American, I never knew these existed
Please continue the videos 🙏🙏🙏📷📷📷
Postel < Postal
Is it just me or does their logo look more like "map titen" than "map men" 😭😭
What about greenland
It should be .tv which is associated with Tuvalu but mainly used for television.
Haven’t watched yet but I can smell Tuvalu
Did anyone else notice IBM - Irritable Bowel Movement...or should i just grow up😂😂
Hahaha my new favorite channel top shit lads....
7:48 I've had a few .tk domains. Facebook bans it.....
WHY BETTER HELP! Don't work with these people
I actually forgot I had to type in URL's exactly back in the day
Stop sponsoring betterhelp
I remember Australia had .oz for some time.  I think Melbourne University was still using mu.oz for some things around year 2000
You'll never guess that it's...tuvalu...like...Idk...pretty obvious...doesn't take a genius to just lookup the country that uses .tv since all 2 letter tlds are country codes...including .io
chat don't use betterhelp
I wonder if they've ever said "we're the map... And here's the men". They must get confused sometimes. Love your videos btw! Educational and fun😂
Daily reminder better help is shady
9:51 missed opportunity to insert a Ryan Reynolds picture
Country codes are actually really useful for knowing what language the website is going to be in! For example, as an estonian, I know that .ee websites are in estonian, or at the very least tied to Estonia in some way. Or when I am looking for information from inside another country, I'll know that the websites with that country code are most likely to be relevant. Because Google is only useful for finding info in english and everything else tends to get buried if you don't speak that language and are searching in english.
0:38 My god, I remember this from the Tower Bridge video!
9:53 "non-Brits might not be familiar with this term." More like: Americans arent used to it. Her ein Germany or the netherlands the word is also often used.
Dipping right out of the video when the betterhelp sponsorship comes on
tv
Go to Stockholm City Museum. Ground floor look at the maps. They promote CCP propaganda there😅 but you have to look for it❗
Weird hearing a reference to "websites" in 1984 given that the web wasn't even invented until 1992. 🤣
I wish for a map men episode about space maps
Tuvaloo right?
Wow, that's alot of new zealand flags.
Not sure why there was a waffle iron in that computer advert, but ok...
nice to see you're back jay! could we see some more unfinished london, or an official end to that series?
Bro, it has been three months. What are you gonna upload again I’ve been waiting.😢
Can you do an episode of map men about the american reservations please???
Lemme guess. Its tk
Never heard of it? I have a bunch of friends from Tokelau, so there.
it's Twitch right edit: it wasn't
Map Men, Map Men, Map Map Map, Men Men!!! Please, we need more Map Men! I just discovered your channel and OMG you guys are AMAZING together! But umm, 3 months since your last video??? What's up with that??? 😢 LOL kidding aside, I hope everything is okay and you didn't stop making videos for any particular reason. I just need to learn some more before my brain turns to mush from 'typical" YouTube content 🤣 Your also one of the only channels I watch ads on because you two are so darn creative, half the time I don't know it's an ad until you say so! Thank you for the amazing, funny videos!
I guessed Tuvalu's .tv. Let's see now ...eh, I was close
Seeing a YouTuber you like shilling betterhelp is like ordering your favourite beer and getting a mugful of poison instead...
Great outro song
Batman
.bok, .bok, .bok, .bok, .bok, .bgaaaaark
So that's why we have the bs .AC.UK and .CO.UK?
I guess Tuvalu because .tv!
wheres the other 4 vids then
edna!
how far do i have to scroll down the comments before someone else agrees that computers were better when they were beige and chonky and came with their own waffle maker as an accessory?
You all are lucky Czechoslovakia dissolved... .cs would have been every Counter-Strike server :D
.tv
10:42 mark my words people in the future would look at this and go like "Damn they guessed it nonsensically correct"
Looked up Jon Postel.   He has The IT Beard. He's forgotten more than you know. He was there. 2000 years ago. When it all began.   ...and was already bitter *back then*
No offence but it is March 2024 and still no vids but take ur time❤
Reminds me of my primary school days when I had my .TK website rederect to my dumb website, to avoid permanent ads lol.
Make a song about the most rectangular countries in the world
Where can I get a “What would Mr Spoon do?” bumper sticker?
So Butter Help isn’t a thing?
Map men, map men, map map map men men.
Mmmm... Beef Butter... :)
10:29 .rocks was in twice    I won...time to celebrate...  .oooh .eeee .ooohahhahh... :)
Guess before watching: Tuvalu (pretty sure it's .tv)
wait i just found out your brother is WHO???????
HAH! JOKES ON YOU I KNOW THE FLAG OF TOKELAU!!!
Great video as usual, but perhaps don't have BetterHelp as a sponsor. Not only do the proceedings go to support Israel, but the treatment of both their employees and customers has been much less that stellar.
Gotta love mapmen
Too right incoming advert warning animation. You NERDS 🎉🎉❤
i was 100% expecting it to be .tv, surprised it wasn't, even more surprised how big my own country is with .de
Love me some Map Titen videos every one in a while
for a second i thought the thumbnail was the Strangereal world map
jsyk betterhelp have been sued for selling therapy data to advertisers
Lovely stuff. I particularly liked the little "there's an advert coming" scrolling box because of it's complete unnecessary-ness (not a word)
How do I get my hands on some of that Beef Butter? Sounds delicious.
i use .en
ah i remember having .tk websites when i was teenager
.tk
I am a nerd, that was on an Amstrad cpc.
Moldova here. Our TLD is ".md", and even if not so popular, still some google searches return ".md" sites, which are not owned by Moldova's business or government, but by doctors. MD = "doctor of medicine", so some health professionals have their own sites with ".md" TLD.
I thought the most popular country code was ".ck", for the Cook Islands (where they?)
Ok then I have another challenge: the most triangle country in the world
its 5am, I've got an exam in 7 hours and im watching this instead. I regret nothing.
10:35 As a Spanish, I know that in the most nationalist regions of Catalonia they use .cat and it isn’t because of cats.
Make a song about the roundest countries in the world
Mark looks like Will from In Betweeners
BetterHelp? Really? Come on guys, in this day and age there's no excuse for not doing research on the companies that offer you sponsorships.
POSTMAN PAT!! 3:17
dot TV of Tuvalu
Just a small thing but Postel didn’t start ICANN, he and Joyce K Reynolds formed IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which was then absorbed into ICANN soon after his death, with the transfer being facilitated by Reynolds.
as a selfish, self-obsessed, self-loathing and self-centred Dane, I am really curious as to why there is 1 registered .dk domain for every 4.4 Danes screw these other countries, why are we slightly more important than we likely should be!?
J'pense que ça va être tuvalu
That intro qas great
The Americans invented DNS so of course they can do whatever they want with it lol
3:55 hate how much you look like todd howard in this
I will never stop being amazed at how little the domain for CATalonia is used...
i guess tuvalu (tv)
.su for Soviet Union is still on the map =)
.cx
The end credit music is so blissful😂
please drop an episode
8:35 "because money, and because money!" That is spot on, I'm so gonna use that.
10:53 THIS IS SO FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🗣️‼️
You keep referring to DNS's creation in relation to websites, but websites didn't exist back when DNS was being created. It was created for other, pre-web internet services, and the web just took advantage of it.
Is it a requirement for Youtubers to do absolutely no research on sponsors (despite doing an enormous amount for the actual video), or do they just not care.
Betterhelp has recently been caught sell data on people's mental health to Facebook, Snapchat, Criteo, and Pinterest.   They collect information on vulnerable people to sell their profiles for a profit allowing advertisers to recommend targeted products like pills and sudo remedies. Taking advantage of vulnerable people and lying about the privacy of their service.
I love the random Mick Hucknall cameo at 9:52
Pure genius
Mapmen.co.uk
I’m still waiting for that “capitals of the world song” that was suggested in the squarest country song
Skip da ad 4:56
The Netherlands’s is NL! 😃🇳🇱🧡👍
I'm guessing the next one will be about the telephone system.
Jay are you reading comments today can I get a heart
I thought tld stood for "too long didn't", for people for whom "tldr" is tld(r).
2:37 AND YOU DIDNT PUT THE LASER KIWI FLAG
I've only just stumbled onto this channel. Consider yourselves subscribed. BTW, I'm in Australia so I get British humour which is almost as strange as ours.  :)
I don't think I've ever encountered a .tk website.
geography class at school ❌ rude silly British men on internet ☑️
As for that bumper sticker, well - I have finally found out about Button Moon.  Sweet kiddie show, rather eager-sounding narrator.
why does lithuania latvia and estonia belong to russia lt for lithuania lv for  latvia
Chop chop. You need another upload. Don’t take the piss.   Kind regards.
i love this channel
I guessed Tuvalu.
Behold: the Internet! My God! It's full of ads!
Happy birthday, Mark! Congrats on another lap around the sun! 🎉
Happy birthday, Mark!
Germany is far too big.  I don't understand it, we are the least digitalised country in the... western world, let's call it that
is it .tv? That's my guess. Where's my money
"OR DID IT?" Dumbledore asked calmly.
I just wanted to subscribe to your channel, but after seeing that you are not reacting at all to your viewers concerns regarding your "sponsor" is telling me everything I need to know about your ethics. Real men would answer, you are hiding. 👎
One of the ones i come alot is .tf.  Tf is for French Southern and Antarctic Lands officially.   But it is most common for trading digital items for the popular free to play game team fortress 2. Which features the endangered french species known as "the spy crab",so i guess it fits
Thought I saw bunghole under the domain name list. Slowed it down. Did see bunghole.
🇺🇲🇺🇸
9:53 - Toby Le Squid's CV is simply amazing. 😂
You should make a video about the regions of Europe
@9:52 That image is inappropriate.
Why are so many British domains registered in Colombia?
As a Dutch person, I love how the Netherlands just commited and became one of the biggest on the map for such a small country. Living in Belgium, Belgians always presume a .nl site is a porn site..... That may explain why we have so much domain names. Although I have never encountered the issue....  Edit; Joost Zuurbier literally means "Joost Sourbear" not making that stuff up, although that family name was probably made up. (Although we have a famous comedian officially named mister Pancake so I wouldn't be surprised if this was a real family name as well....)
man, I love your videos. I wish I had you guys as my teachers in school!
Yay four men
I think I just saw Mark Cooper-Jones at Atis for lunch...I was a bit shy to say high and because he was with someone, but if it was you, Hi Mark! I love this channel!
.us would be a lot more popular if it didn't require uncloaked owner info.
Do you guys like MrBeat?
Fun fact, the Spanish region of Catalonia uses ".cat" as its top level domain name
Just got clips from this on TikTok and was like nice they're on there too now but then I realised it might just be someone stealing your videos so I don't know if I should follow them, is there an official Jay Foreman TikTok?
Puerto Rico is both a state and a country in most postal lists even in the US
So great that you guys are back!!
Me: I bet it's TV
Yeah!
the title of the video says I will NEVER guess it. before watching, here is a list of my 19,683 guesses of what i think it will be. I have almost certainly guessed it.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1so-s0Hbw8bKX_JCRtbWAb3KLTepbJ3yGbD8IqhyvegE/edit?usp=sharing  edit: turns out i made 27 times too many guesses because i didn't realize they were all 2 letters.  edit 2: I GUESSED IT in row 318
This was quite educational and funny, in fact I actually found funny how the YouTube ad was perfectly shown right after part 1 like it was planned
5:02 TLD for Czechoslovakia was cs, not cz. FIxed at 5:54 🙂
No websites in 80s yet. Sorry, guys. Their concept was created in 1989 and the first tools in 1990.
5:24 actually Northern Ireland is still (I think) Celtic so instead of saying “Ats us nai!” I think you should have put “Yma o hyd!”
Christ almighty I love the map men but I can’t get away from betterhelp ads. Am I the only person in the world who remembers their scandals? Selling extremely sensitive user mental health information to the highest bidder and iirc some of their ‘licensed’ therapists not being licensed at all! They’ve already irreparably tarnished their brand for me and no amount of marketing is going to undo that. C’mon!  EDIT: I read the comments. Yeah no I’m not the only one at all. YouTubers need to research their sponsors, don’t take dirty money! ;)
What happens to deleted codes? Does every .dd now forward to .de automatically?
Hey jay foreman When is the video of map men on the two dakotas and the two carolinas???
Please tell me that the bottom left of 1:08 is a reference to the hampsterdance. I need this.
shame you are sponsered by such a dangerous shadow company
Jay foreman has the best sense of humour in the world,  its so sad its out of the range of most people.
Another funny and interesting video! Happy New Year!
So, the one thing you definitely should not do when broadcasting across the entire internet: Assume that you know something about the viewer. So, while the two of you never heard of Tokelau, it's a very stupid mistake to look into the camera and claim that I have never heard of Tokelau either. Next time, just make a map of locations YOU have never heard of.
Babe wake up mapmen posted
You made again false claim, "Kosovo" isn't country on first, and on second ".xk" isn't on same level as other country domain's it's just private domain which can't be permanently assigned. It's just temporary, unofficial domain. Like that "country".
8:16 this is also the reason you must be very careful when you want to use cctlds, you never know what brain damage shit they will do whenever they feel like it.
Just guessing that it's Tuvalu, .tv
Joost Zuurbier means Joost Sour Beer in Dutch
.NL
0:33 but if you can teleport why were you in a car?
Wish I had this video when I first needed to learn about internet architecture, educational videos on it were bad a couple years ago let alone edutainment videos.
kie estas la Esperantaj subtekstoj? :<
Only registered co-ops by the ICA can use the .coop domain
*OR DIDD ITT*
This is the only Youtube channel that I don't skip the in-video ads on.
what do you mean "often considers itself..."?
I'm actually impressed that the DPRK even has internet websites to remotely begin with.
You guys are map men and not URL heros.
Tuvalu
The most surprising thing I learnt from this video is that DJ stands for disc jockey. I don’t know what I thought it stood for but it certainly wasn’t that.
Jay is making a hell of an assumption that I haven’t heard of every country in the world and made attempts to memorise them and their flags. When I saw “tk” on the map, I immediately knew it was Tokelau.
What code should I use for my sometimes-fake therapy website?
I alr knew this one, weird.
hereliesjonpostelsuchalovelyandclevermanmissedbymany1943-1998.com/rest/in/peace
Same name fame and game are words that rhyme
The new Zeland one is 6 flags
Guess before watching:   .tv, Tuvalu
Some funny things about America inventing the internet in the first place is only the United States Goverment can use .gov or .mil (for Goverment and Military) ans also well duh county codes only exist because the United States Goverment allowed everyone to use the freaking internet about 40 years after we invented it, also for Free. This is the Famous Al Gore invented the Internet Debacle which he totally did technically kinda.
But since the Internet was developed in the US, by default any website that doesn't use a country top level code, is US. Lol, nm, you pointed that out. Why do so many stars have Arabic names? Because they were discovering and naming them first. If you invent or discover something, you get to name it/set some rules.
My country of Malaysia's ccTLD is '.my' which makes it good for websites for healthcare and house renting and medicine
3:34 this is wrong both Iceland and Israel are marked .is in real life Israel is .il
.cat is intended to be used by websites related to catalonia or the catalan language, it’s not a crazy one.
soviet union never went away..its still there
if the cables where a part of the physical map of the internet, the country codes are a part of the digital map of the internet
My guess. Tuvalu
i keep clicking back and forth through these vids because i'm laughing way to hard all the time.
.tv
My guess is .tv
As usual a funny video, but the partnership with BetterHelp is very dubious, who are known for and have been fined for selling privacy senstive data to other companies.
In Canada, each province has their own TLD... for example, Prince Edward Island is ".pe.ca"...
0:23 Ah yes, the DNS system. Or Domain Name System system.
Thanks map man man  Map     Man
Just started watching, I’m gonna call either Tuvalu or US.
6:12 Ukraine looks weird
​ @JayForeman  okay so why have you guys not made a channel called "Ad Men" yet, where you only upload hilarious ads for various online services and other stuff (that's paying for ads) 🤷‍♂
.horse supremacy!
it’s tuvalu
I assume .tv
10:55 Jays guitaring has improved
9:53 Oh, yes the British term "curriculum vitae"...
6;38 the netherlands is litlle bit big I tink for its size😅
Hi Map men, thank you for your videos, could you do a video on Berlin conference and divide of African map in 1884-1885 ? It would be useful for everyone I think even if it is a touchy topic. Thanks a lot
before i even finish the video, lemme guess... Cook Islands? co.ck?
Hilarious and informative as always! I'm less thrilled to see BetterHelp still getting promoted after its predatory business practices and privacy violations, but I'm also glad to see people (men especially!) talking about mental health and therapy. Win some, lose some, I guess.
Tuvalu, because it is .tv
Tv Tuvalu
Oh ew betterhelp sponsorship
0:40 I do that today.
i guess .to
.tv belonged to Tuvalu until it sold it
What in the f is that the netherlands on the map
Lol devprce party being an add i thought it was going be about countries getting independence causing issues
the chokehold BetterHelp has over youtubers is crazy
Why does this video feel a bit like it was uploaded like 10 years ago? 😂  Don’t get me wrong, still a banger vid
.nu the french word for nude.... a great domain
Jokes on you, I'm an American and my first dozen websites I ever coded were served on dotTK domains because of the fact that they were free to register and I was 12 years old with no money
I hate the wasp like internet.
The soviet union still lives in Putin's hearth.
Aside rom your conten being entertaining I think your videos are the only ones where I watch the sponsorship part because it is always different, unqiue and entertaining :P You should get an extra pay for that.

*BetterHelp is not a good, or even decent company. They sell your consultation data for keyword scraping and sell your data for the relevant advertising. Please dont take sponsorships from them.*
Great video, well done, keep up the good work!!!
2:22 I was expecting: "Hi, Mark! How are you calling me from outside the UK as if you're here? Are you using the +44 dialing code?" "Actually, I downloaded surfshark"
ai images :(
Thanks for the video
very nice video💖
Hmm, so why is there a .co in most of uk domains? Is there some law preventing .uk to be used commercially? 🤔
11 minutes for something that could be answered in 3 characters. Youtube things.
If Scotland ever becomes independent, they'll run into a problem with two-letter country codes and ccTLDs: every single two-letter combination that makes sense for Scotland is already taken.  .sc? Seychelles .sl? Sierra Leone .st? São Tomé and Principle .sd? Sudan .rs, as in Republic of Scotland? Taken by the Republic of Serbia .sr for Scottish Republic? Suriname .sk, as in funky Skotland? Slovakia .sx, as in "Scotland, and an X because we cannot think of anything better, also we want Elon Musk to invest here"? Used for the Dutch half of Sint Marteen island.  The Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland is Alba. Since .al is already taken for Albania, it's often been proposed that Scots would pick .ab, which isn't all that good. Also, in the off chance that Abkhazia became an internationally accepted independent country, they'll likely claim .ab first.
You should’ve check this out because he worked with Jon Postel. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mockapetris
2:30 is this a hint that the next episode is about flags
quick question! i was told that .cat was for catalonia and no longer for cats... is it part of the ccT...Thing? or bc it has 3 letters it's something different even if it refers to a world region? thks!
“I went on the internet this week and I found this...”
As a long time hostmaster i had heard of Tokelau and actually ate several toasties which were given out with a free .tk Domain at a dutch hacker camp. Great video though.
It's not just the content but the way you guys produce it that makes it so wonderfully watchable 🤣
Jf
i remember registering and using those free .tk domains back in the day. i think about it once in a while. they even have a small blurb on why it was free and mentioning the island.
Yeah I went to that website at 5:42 good work lads
When are you going back to Suede for some singing, Brett!?
ah yes, BetterHelp the least predatory and dehumanizing provider in mental healthcare
.cat MENTIONED RAAAAAAAAAAAH it's not about cats it's about catalonia
.io?
9:49 how about British indian ocean territory
Lol
The only channel that I don't skip the sponsored ad
Also: In May 2023, Google introduced .zip and .mov TLDs, and people pointed out that they can be easily used for scams.  Oh, they also added .meme and .dad
9:03 for more context: freenom was sued by meta (facebook) and ceased offering new domains in march 2023
After 4 minutes I'm crying out loud: "GET ON WITH IT".
Nation States are the reason we have internet
.tv - Tuvalu .. as a guess before watching the video
my favorite kosher russian spies, right after boy boy and ididathing, and Jhonny Harris, how did I notice it? it is incredibly easy to notice flaws in the anglo personality of all of you once you stop trusting people, being perfect poliglots and being able to use a gun and rifle perfectly is something the average westener that does youtube could never do, you are too perfect and flawless, americans and british can barely speak english say less about speaking many languages perfectly, the average westener is too effeminate and weak to ever be able to handle a gun or a rifle in a perfect way, you have to be russian spies
I think it's .tv
"THREE"Dominos Pizza adverts for one MapMen video....
That oddly looks like map of Strangereal
Random Shower Thought: I'd love to see an intro where it's two maps speaking, and then they go "Welcome to Men Maps. We're Maps, and here's the Men!" and then the step aside to see your faces on a globe or something.
Another lovely Jay Foreman tune to close us out… my ears are bleeding, but just a little!
I was expecting that to be .tv for Tuvalu or .ws for [Western] Samoa
MEN DOT COM? 😭😭😭 DID I HEAR IT RIGHT?
When I first glanced at the map and saw 25 million .tk domains, I googled it and saw it was Tokelau and immediately guessed, “Scams?” Then I saw the vid. Yup. I was right. Scams.
5:03 I noticed you put .kw twice.. unforgivable mistake. Do better next time, Jay.
8:43 Euro banknotes in 2001? 😉
Love your video. Screw Betterhelp.
i hope toby le squids got the job
Well, I've been listening to 3:12 on a loop for the last ten minutes
I love you
Perfect inclusion of Northern Ireland, the aggression and then contentment came through so well.
Posting a random comment....  FOR THE ALGORITHM!!!! ❤
Cool Video
There was a huge glaring error in this video no one seems to be mentioning... at exactly 11:13 it ended... unacceptable...
sorry for sending you 7 photos!
Honestly Im surprised at just how large Denmark is on the map. I mean I kinda get why, basically every website that uses the language uses .dk, and some may use it for Donkey Kong jokes, but Denmark is also one of the most digitalised countries in the world with very high IT use and dependency for day to day life... (which is probably why the Russians keep harrassing us with DOS attacks all the time).
Loved the addition of the advertisment Cue Mark
3:33 Wouldn’t Eritrea have been apart of Provisional Ethiopia, and Yemen still be split?
:)
Always interesting and hilarious.  And you're both so handsome!  Especially Mark (sorry Jay-- but you have a lot of "personality").
Love you guys
headphone testing song detected
tuvalu. that's my guess.
this feels like the closest thing to Sheldon's "Fun with flags" from BBT
Brilliantly humorous and informative,  Stuff I didn’t need to know but am glad I now do.
I object.  You never answered the question buried in the vid's title.  False advertising.  Or is it "false clickbaiting"?
.pn is for the Pitcairn Islands and was used by ESPN at one point and for promotions of the original Hunger Games movie as it was kind of like an abbreviation of the country's fictional name in which the story took place.
The funny thing is, the list of country codes starting at 2:50 are only those in Latin script.  Now there are also ccTLDs in pretty much any script that has a modicum of speakers.
and the thing I to do to a skill share subscription is want
I guessed Tuvalu and had never heard of name of the place with the real "most popular internet [sic] country code", so your title was right in my case.

3:47 why does the guy in yellow look like Todd Howard, shit scared me…!
As a citizen of a lucky .md country, thank you for this piece of art
fun fact: .tf is a domain which has a niche for team fortress 2 base websites (mostly market places, like marketplace.tf)
I appreciate your attention to detail putting the little black and white lines running into the add break. You thought I wouldn't notice, but I did
Perfect - summed it all up nicely. Thanks.
5:42 look it up, it's real
.TV for Tuvalu. Did I guess it?
Fryslân = .frl
This breakfast is gonna be fire 🔥
No fucking way you took the betterhelp sponsorship
Disappointed that you didn't mention .co.ck for the Cook Islands.
It was the beginning of the internet
hey i haven't watched the video but its probably tuvalu right? .tv
Here’s the link if you’d like a Cook Islands domain (.co.ck)  https://www.vodafone.co.ck/domain-admin-policy
These guys' style of comedy reminds me very specifically of the 1999 TV adaptation of Alice Through the Looking Glass starring Kate Beckinsale and a frankly incredible cast of Shakespearey type actors and british comedy stalwarts. So there you go.
I am nostalgic for the time that TLDs mattered.
Why does the part when explaining country codes have New Zealand having so many flags. I thought we had one
THEY RETURNED!
This was a helpful TL:DR for TLDs.
"i didnt buy any food"
I can. It’s .gg, the country code for Guernsey, which I know is not actually a country, but it still has one.
RIP .tk, it was fun while it lasted. Thankfully I had the chance to get my websites off of it and leave redirects.  As for the existence of ccTLDs, it is still useful to know from a site's domain name that it is for example operated by people in a particular country, or that you can read it in a particular language. Useful for Google domain-based search (site:) too if you want to look only for particular sources.
3:41 the advert queue thingfrom analog TV is a nice touch
Let me guess.. .tv?
Tuvalu
Gotta say - I love the ITV style cue dots before the ads - nice touch!
You guys: *Rapidly flips through book*...."Damn america and their ability to invent and develop the internet" always gotta cry about somethin. 😂👍
.TV
Without even having watched the video yet, I'd say Tuvalu? (tv)
I remember seeing a lot of physical advertisements a few years ago for a .amsterdam TLD
Ew, BetterHelp partnership...
I thought the answer was going to be ".tv"
you learn something new everyday! 🌍
It's fun that non-latin domaines are existing. For example кто.рф
Let me guess it's .tv
.io?
peppes.pizza
.splunge and .butthole! 😂
Im here only for the music at the end.
That outro music gave me a right headache omg
That USA-vs-foreign countries map!
4 days 915k views …… the channel has amazing engagement !
0:30 relatable
0:37 -- Old Samsung TV sound effect
Freenom has now been sued by meta, so no free domains are available to register. Also, there were many other agreements with other countries to get their own free domain, like mali, gabon, Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea. All of the contracts with the countries have expired apart from tokelau. TK domains can still be managed though.
+420. Before watching the video. Czech republic
Love me some Map Men.  The script and delivery are priceless.  Well written and interesting!
darnit, I saw the .splunge TLD scroll past and almost had a heart attack.
It has got to be .co.ck
So Germany as a country is number 1. It seems to be intentional that they don't mention that
My website domain ends in .website
Your thumbnail gave me an aneurysm trying to understand it. It's like one of those lost to time medieval/ancient maps that look super goofy with monsters and wtvr.
Knew it'd be worth it typing the link on the gravestone 😂
A few fun facts posted. Here's another one.  A lot of mail infrastructure couldn't cope with delivering email directly to a top level domain even though this is technically allowed on the Internet.  Norfolk Island (.nf) used to announce MX records to receive mail so domains like info@nf were valid.  They ran in to this problem and eventually stopped doing this.
TLDs that are not ccTLDs are usually called gTLDS (generic TLDs) while the term TLD refers to all top level domains.
Domains do still matter, otherwise their wouldn't be 1500 TLDs.  Setting up a TLD is an expensive and complex process.  Organisations only do this if they consider it worth it.  In most cases this is because they think it can turn a large profit.
Nope, in Kazakhstan its .kz
I have to know… is that a waffle press?
Argh! An ad break broke into the middle of your ad break.
How do you guys say these hilarious lines with a straight face, it absolutely astounds me
Literally the only YouTube channel I watch were I don't skip over the Paid Partnership. Well done as always!
I was really hoping you'd mention something about Cook Islands domains...
Fun fact: Montserrat's MS is not only unofficially used by Microsoft but also by sites from the German city of Münster due to MS being their license plate code.
Hey! .cat is our pseoudo country code! We Catalans might not be independent but we're trying alright?
Great vid
I used to think Beardyman was the Man.... But now I know who the real Man is.The Man from MapMen  Amen
There might be one more reason to explain why .us TLD is not as popular.  When you register any domain, you are asked to provide a set of contact information (usually up to 4 of them - Registrant, Administative, Technical, Billing). After you register a domain, all the information about it like its Registrar company, expiration date, nameservers and contact details can be found in a public database called Whois. Since not many people actually want their contact details to be public, there are services like WhoisGuard, which replace the actual information with a generic set of details.  When it comes to ccTLDs, most of them do not support WhoisGuard. Nevertheless, each TLD displays the information in Whois differently (sometimes it is only available on the Registry website) and the vast majority hide almost all of the contact details of the domain owner. However, .us Registry (which manages all .us domains) does things differently. They require all this information to be valid and public while they also don't allow WhoisGuard or a similar service to be used with any .us domain. This is a well-known situation amongst particular Internet users.  Basically, when a new .us domain is registered, they somehow track this information in Whois and then start spamming and calling the domain owner to the point which makes many people regret getting a .us domain in the first place. There is a way around this, of course, by replacing your actual number and email address with a dedicated set of contacts. Unfortunately, as a consequence, a lot of people either cancel .us domains shortly afterwards or avoid those registrations altogether.
My cousin had one of the first home computers, an orange Commadore? As kids then a PC was only good for playing Frogger or waiting 5 minutes for a pic to appear inch by inch. Anyway gotta question.  Which country is used most  for a VPN address (is that even possible to find out?)
That ending followed by the channel popups is the most ironic thing I've ever seen lmao
The advert had me literally rolling on the floor laughing. Out of all the sponsored segments on YouTube Jay's are the only ones that I don't skip even though I won't ever buy the product.
Scary! Makes me never want to go up everest haha. Great editing and never really thought it would actually look like that.
.commercial .organization .network .military .education .government
Before the video starts, I'm gonna make a guess: Tuvalu, for the .TV. I know it's one of Tuvalu's biggest income sources
Why on earth are people still taking betterhelp sponsorships
Map men map men map map map map men. en.
Surely that was Australia's flag.
before watching, it's gonna probably be tuvalu.
ah yes, better help. the company that had a scandal last year
I need a midi file of the ending credits music.
Tuvalu? .tv  Popular with TV companies. Also Belgium .be, as YouTube use it to shorten urls
Damn it! I was looking forward to watching your video. But then no. You had to get sponsored by a terrible company
why didnt youtube show me this till 3 days after it was uploaded?
country codes aren't 20th century, they are 'all centuries'. They cover 4000+ years of history.
Thank you for a very informative and entertaining video. Greetings from Sweden 🇸🇪.
'Planet' 😂😂😂
U in South Africa??
Welcome back 🙀
Wait, you actually bought the domain? For us? The humble map men viewers?!
I swear the cat domain it's not about literal cats...
My guess before watching the video is Tuvalu, '.tv' because it looks like television.
.cat isn't meant for cat websites! It was intended for websites in catalan.
Americans do actually use CV, but it has a different meaning here. A résumé is more focused on your job experience and relevant qualifications, whereas a CV focuses on your educational/research experience. The latter is unsurprisingly more common in academia, so I’m not actually sure how widely understood the term is here in the US
5:24 "Ats us nai!"  😂😂😂😂 Now that's a back home phrase you don't hear to often outside of Belfast.
Ngl, it’s a bit of a letdown to see you guys supporting betterhelp.
I guessed Tuvalu, because I knew about the .tv domain. I was so close to being correct.
I never thought about it before, but yeah - that is how we view country codes. It sounds silly out loud, but I always believed that other countries had to put country codes on ensured because that’s their version of it, as opposed to the standard American version.
The gamegear!
When it was mentioned .tk was a island, I was immediately like, "TOKELAU!???!" Apparently yes, yes it was. WILD.
OH this title is weird  excited to watch the vid anyway
These men lingu lingika
.cx is smaller than .tk? Kids today!
Love to see more of your videos! Always a delight!  If only I'd been able to see this video a few years ago and save myself the research agony. It's put very succinctly, my compliments!
All hail our Wasp Monster Girl overlords!
Enjoyed your video
Ah, this made me remember when I had a .tk domain name back in the heady days of 2002. Fond memories.
Well, Grayson, at least GB is the right size on the map.
DNS is domain name server afaik
Please tell me someone else recognized the melody also used by a German Tolkien podcast
Literally the only YouTube channel where I watch the sponsored ad as well as the actual content
Paused right at the start, I'm guessing tuvalu
for those too lazy to type the domain at 5:43 https://www.hereliesjonpostelsuchalovelyandclevermanmissedbymany1943-1998.com/rest/in/peace
damn the url is real
Before watching: my guess Tuvalu
How did you manage to never make a TLDR joke?
Amazing video as usually. You are doing great job.
it led me somewhere.... ....the url on jon postel's grave.....
nope. better help is horrible. breaching of patient confidentiality. please don't.
There's nothing more funny and informative in the same time on the Internet anywhere. Brilliant stuff guys!
nice video lads, question in the title and 12 minutes of spewing shit
Tuvalu Im guessing
I wasn’t expecting an “ats us nai”. Someone has done their homework 😊
That guy who first named tuvalu centuries ago was such a visionary
MAP
You guys should feature the Heraldic map of Europe
Popularity of the Czech domain (.cz) is interesting. It's probably that high because the letter combination "cz" is quite rare, so Czechs can easily relate to it and feel national connection to it. That's why you often see it in nicknames, more than many other countries.  It's funny that "cz" doesn't ever occur in Czech language, but that makes its meaning always clear and unambiguous.   It's kind of a symbol or a logo of our country.
Tl tuvalu
As a Kiwi, I know about tokelau, but I bet there are a lot of us that still don't, even though it's part of our country. They clearly don't watch mapmen
Another fantastic video from the funny men 😂 but where's the advert!? You need another sponsor!
Another hilariously nerdy video from my favourite internet geeks 🥰 Cheers from .au 😅
8:50 “This is the real Facebok. And you have win a p[rize. Please be enbter your credit card details.” Haha! 🤣🤣🤣
.tv   🇹🇻
Where is unfinished london? I’m waiting! Do it with football. And when it’s map men again then do it with micronation
as a tech-disaster meself i am deeply disappointed by this episode as i adore all the oether ones
Thought it was going to be .tv so that was an interesting turn of events
Thanks!
US not using a country code is like the UK not putting our name on stamps- we invented the modern postal service
So whats up with .co.uk
hi ! country code are not necessary for building a good website .   but. the website you are searching might not be register in the DNS of your internet service provider.  and if your dns doesn't find the IP adress of your website , he can "ask" to to a data base.  each domain have their own (or several databases) and they are not localize in the same place.
Low numbers for .af, didn't even get a callout in the name fame game
It’s .tv right? Ps I haven’t watched the video yet
Funny men back
Bok bok bok bok bok 🐓
Dark filter
8:49 Looks legit.
Just gave all us kiwis PTSD
I think, jouuuust got out of a copyright on that last song XD
6:39 Tf happened to Bangladesh...why is it distorted
Well we did invent the internet so……
I liked the bit about the internet since I sometimes use that. :D
i like the explanation except your pre-tld hostnames have tlds on them.
Not really relevant, but thank you fir using Ukraine's real border lines. Rn even this looks like some kind of support from favourite creators❤️
This video is too long for me to read, could somebody please summarise it?
excellent video! the outro music was one of my favourite things on your channel for a while, im surprised there are not more comments about it.
time to go get a .tk domain—aw
guessing ahead of time, italy for all the -it domains?
No way Dankpods music 8:37
“Twisted Ankle in car park.  Sat in car.  GO MUM!”   🤣
Yay 2 days late😅
06:51 as an editor, I felt that in my soul.  😂
Jay Foreman is the only channel that makes sponserships enjoyable.
GO MUM!!
2:36 lol NZ flag, shots fired
YOO ESS AAYYY NUMBER ONEE
So, the question is still not answered. Since .tk is no longer the biggest, what is?
I love that the .tf domains are only used for tf2 websites
its TV i think
Y'all are wrong; it's actually WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/watch
Could you imagine out on a morning jog and you get a popup pornado coming at you like wasps? 🤣😇
When Montenegro ceased to be part of Serbia, it's code went from .yu to .me.
Fwiw, BetterHelp helped me when I needed it most.
Good ending
Honestly, it would kinda make sense to go away from ccTLDs, but it comes down to computing power. The DNS system is a database, broken up by ccTLDS, TlLDS, I nternet providers, and companies. Without them, every sire would be in the same database and would be completely unsearchable.
I kinda look at the us not using the .us country code as the same as the UK not having to put the country on their stamps. It was created here, so it isn't required here.
love these guys
7:45 yes I have
As always, I found this to be quite an informative and entertaining video! I learned about _two_ islands today: Torquay is a small town on the coast of England, while the even smaller Tokelau (which surprisingly, I _have_ heard of) has (or had) the most popular internet country code... despite not even being a country, but part of New Zealand!   Thanks for the video!
I find these videos on the Internet absolutely fascinating!
Video starts with 7 minutes of overintroduction, equivocation and advertisment, and about a minute after getting to the point they reveal that it's not even a true answer to the question in the title anymore. It's rare to find a video that's 100% fluff and filler, good job.
Welcome to Monty Python's Maps of the Internet!
Why no bubble for .com
USA 🇺🇲🇺🇲💪💪
in the early years of the internet, we typed in the IP address of the website, before domain names became a thing!
7:13 😂😂😂
Anyone else notice the repeating .bok?
Evil Edna!!!
You'll never guess that I downvote and do not recommend .... people that use clickbait titles
Love the MEGATRONICS computer with Waffle Maker.  And YURP for Europe. And TT on a phone box, Tokelau Telecom
MAP MEN MAP MEN MAP MAP MAP MEN MEN MEN
.SU never retiring means ICANN knows something we don't
for one, .onion websites are usually alphanumeric domains that look seemingly random. Nobody actually types in a onion website in Tor, you just find them linked on other websites.
I'm guessing it's the British Indian Ocean Territory
Every child who had to build a website in IT lessons circa 2005ish knows about .tk!
that music at the end was le tits 👌🏽
I can guess it’s Tuvalu with .tv
the best series the modern internet had ever seen, thank you so much Mark and Jay
Better help is a scam. Talking to others is never wrong but I recommend using a servies that doesn't steal your data.
i bet it’s going to be tuvalu because it looks like TV
Yes, wasps 😂
Do you have any web addresses that end in the not much used codes that people like myself could go to. For instance I'm kinda having trouble finding any .ak websites     like I hoped maybe a research web site on some obscure stuff
lol - for real? .DE actually is the #1? if only he'd know anyway - this video lacks some "it waa the beginning of the internet" jokes
Brillante.
0:00 .tv That’s my guess. As I understand it Tuvalu got into a kerfuffle about it when they wanted to create their country website.  Edit: Whaddya know. That’s kinda neat! .tk
I LOVE MAP MEN
:0
Ooph! I thought you were better than taking sponsors from a company that's as sketchy as BetterHelp, Jay. They got in trouble from the FTC for breaching personal information laws and lied about people getting help from actual qualified therapists. There was a scandal uncovered 2 years ago where people were scammed out of hundreds and never received a reply back from BetterHelp. There are a bunch of articles from legit sources you can look up. It only takes a quick google search.
Beef butter
This was the best outro music.
It's funny how the US proves country codes don't really matter
TLDR: Top Level Domains Reallyuseful
im guessing .tv
Can better help write prescriptions?
So funny. 😂
:)
The Megatronics DCX-450 appears to come with a handy waffle iron.
Who else was dissapointed that whatismyflag isn't real :(
1:14 out yourself as a user of the CPC 464 with only one nice screenshot  And yes, I mean that seriously, Jay, you outed yourself of being a fan of one of these Alan Sugar machines (which was also my first computer :) ), because this blue and yellow color scheme is so atrocious, only Alan Sugar was able to survive it.
Real ones know about the free tokelau web addresses!!
8:37 That's DankPod's headphone test music
Just the outro gave me an ear infection, other than that a very interesting video!
This is brilliant.
Beautiful song at the end, great job lads.
i want the domain yes.no
i'm quite surprised by how much the Netherlands has got. like sure were densely populated, but still only have 17 million people
.cat is used in all catalan oficial websites
Excellent video very interesting.
TLDR; TLD arrr
This was pretty poorly researched ngl. Better help sucks and you should really look at your sponsors before taking money from them
I'm rather disappointed that you took a sponsor from "better"help
"At's us nai" - brilliant haha
Thank you so much for splitting your videos with a Part 1 and Part 2 with commercials in the middle. That's so much better than YouTube's interrupty way of doing it. I appreciate it greatly. Thank you Map Men!
Anyone else notice the cue dot (the spinny black and white thing) before the adverts @03:40 ? Ahh the nostalgia...
5:26 A Button Moon reference in the wild!
Lately I have been wondering about the country codes in web addresses. Thank you for a video explaining it!!!
Great video. Please do more
Real men keep stum! 😥😡
.tk is a free domain, thats why its massive
cool
Better help has a very dubious and unethical background - disappointed you are promoting them
Oh the outro song🤣. Can you please play and upload the whole song separately?
Cool video, but fuck betterhelp. There's plenty of publically accessible information of all the horrible things with them, research who you're taking sponsorship deals from next time
um 🤣
Every frame is hilarious, even the ads. ;P Well done, as always
.tv
my favourites<3
Is it Tuvalu? (I didnt watch the video, bye)
Me, mainly navigating to sites by typing the url: what are you talking about, nobody does that anymore? Huh. Like.. do you google it and take 3x as long to get there? Only do that for unknowns myself.
Please do not ever stop doing these
the algorithm really told me im autistic today, huh? ngl that was dope. subbed.
7:00 Oh boy, that Germany joke was magnificent <3
CHICKEN!
After the Dutch poldered the sea, we now polder the internet as well. G E K O L O N I S E E R D!
What a horrid song at the end 😂👌
Points for not touching the low hanging fruit of the Cook Islands with a .co before it
It was like a TLD TL:DR
Sorry lads, I knew about .tk because I had one in 2002.
As a side note, DNS is no longer only something designed to simply help humans. It's also critical for machines as it is the root of trust used to verify the identity of a website/internet service. It's probably the most critical part of the Internet after the network links themselves.
Do they think the Isle of Lewis is part of NI??
The credits 😂😂
The ending skit actually made me sad because it's really just a matter of time to they start shoving up ads inside our brains
Thanks!
❤😂😂😂😂❤
I wonder, is there any reason why some countries don't have their codes as standalones? I saw the example for Australia, and I swore there were .au alone sites when I lived there, but now I'm questioning that.
Really lovely video as always guys, but really not pleased seeing you partner with BetterHelp. Their reputation is pretty established at this point: inconsistent, slapdash, and sometimes downright dangerous. The gig-economy-for-therapy model brings so many drawbacks that it really isn't deserving of your support, and you deserve better than their money. I hope you reconsider working with them again.
The ourtro is horrible, i love it!
I like any map where the UK  is more biggly
my guess is 618
Normally I love your videos, but man, a BetterHelp sponsorship is a miss for me. Please please please for the love of maps, do some very basic research into a sponsoring company before accepting their dollars. I know it takes $$$ to make quality content, and I very much support your ability to monetize your content through sponsorships and beyond, but BH is so shady and awful that just seeing it once is enough to erode trust in future (and past) sponsorships because it's clear that due diligence was not done. >< I love your content, and I even usually love watching the funny sponsor segments, but surely there was SOME other company that you could've gotten as a sponsor. Hell, at this point I'd rather see a RAID SHADOW LEGENDS ad than BetterHelp.
Interesting, but not enough maps
before watching guessing it's either .de or .tv
As a geoguessr player, the country codes are actually on my mind quite a lot
map men make me giggle
can we just take a second to appreciate that outro music bc holy HELL why is it so bad that it became good . i cant stop listening to it
For the love of god do not take sponsorships from BetterHelp! They are so sketchy, there's no standard for entry to be a BetterHelp "therapist" and many of them have retraumatised clients with their egregious ignorance and lack of education on any actual mental health training, not to mention complete lack of professionalism. ALSO the fact BetterHelp got fined 7.8 Billion dollars for illegally selling all their clients information to Facebook and Snapchat for advertising purposes. They are a trashcompany just out to make money from vunerable people. Please vet your sponsorship deals properly, a simple google search would have told you everything BetterHelp has done that has actively ruined many people's mental health, not helped it.
These guys are the best.  Please do not stop.
TORQUAY MENTIONED 🐟🏖🎡⛵️🔑
6:15 Nakhchivan exclave is omitted from the map map map, map map map men men.
I thought it was .io
Why erroneously call it an "internet country code" and not "top level domain" in the title of the video? How will I ever trust your titles again?
I have a Tokelau 1oz silver coin, "Goddess Europa".
Just to be picky, the world wide web wasn't invented until 1989 - so wasn't around in 1985. We had ftp, gopher, archie, smtp, and most commonly etc.
2:06 I’m pretty sure there’s 4000 people using the internet in my house alone
Gotta be io
10:46 "the internet will just come at you like wasps" is incredible, hilarious, and, i deeply fear, accurate
Wonder what the least used internet country code is. The source map seems to indicate it's the Marshall Islands.
My guess is tuvalu because of .tv
these guys are some sort of government experiment, they dont age
7:15 As an American, this is true. You can tell because we call our nation America (and ourselves Americans) despite it only taking up a fraction of North+South America.
Also I can add the Argentinian example which its code is .ar, which is a form of making infinitive verbs in spanish (such as "tomAR", "comprAR", etc.)
.рф
Dns meaning
I don't know what I love more, the *16 or the waffle iron.
Better Help is a scam
we legit invented the whole thing, so we get .com ... Just like how our country code on the phone is 1. Get off your lazy butts and go invent something.
Wtf with the representantion of Argentina?? That's not even the same shape!
Guessing this at the start of the video: It's Tuvalu, .tv
i owe a lot to John Postal
please stop advertising betterhelp
I’m getting my guess in early (0:43) - .boat
The IP address at 1:00 points to a Veterans Centre in Pala Alto, California.  More fake news from these so-called "Map" men.  #Disgusted
routinely the only channel whose video I will continue to watch even after i'm finished eating, tyfys o7
Is it .tv (Tuvalu)?
This video is so British
The 0:55  IP would never work unless you have edited your hosts file to prevent that url from actually going to the real thing
The Mike Wazowski graphics were great.
I thought it would be .tv 🇹🇻
"the domain name fame game" is a fantastic sentence to say
MEN MEN MEN MEN MEN
Torquay Mentioned??????? 7:50
Why there are a part of brazil under colombia in this map?
I had to pause the video after the "I Can't" joke as I was laughing so hard!
Tom scott reference at the end?
Why oh why oh why did you omit the laser eyes kiwi mckiwiface flag!?
babe wake up new map men content just dropped
Map at 3:33 shows both Israel and Iceland as ".is" which was never correct. ".il" has always been the ccTLD of Israel and according to Wikipedia it was actually the 3rd ccTLD to have ever been registered, after ".us" and ".uk"
I bloody love the map men!!!
When is norway gonna sell their rights to pornsites?? Like Por.no is genius
Always a good day when map men post a video
Mick Hucknall? Perfect.
Love your videos, but disappointed that you’re sponsored by BetterHelp. They’re very predatory
I’ve never sat through an advert on the Internet before today. You must be doing something right.
7:29 Love this map
3:13
This video was already so good, and then you throw that outro music at me! What an absolute delight!
actually i guessed it right, learn to read my mind better next time jay forman
When I was an extremely online teen in like 2005 we had a running joke about Tokelau as our "random" place of choice. I don't have a clue if this was just my friend group (which included a bunch of NZ people) or if this was a widespread meme. Either way, I had in fact heard of Tokelau!
Loved the 'outro'  😂
Was kind of expecting the Cook Islands .co.ck to be higher up
The out of tune and mis-timed outro has Jay Forman written all over it.
Sounds like your guitar's broken mate
I LOVE your work guys. It's exactly my kind humor. I find your jokes and presentation so good.
watched specifically for .nu and was not disapointed
Map map wow cool
In the future you may not want to use a background with the CIA’s Memoiral Wall of those who died for their duty
Map men, map men, map map men men
"defunctries" amazing
2:37 thanks for putting in the flag change but you left out the laser kiwi
I study english and the funniest/best thing about this channel is that that it always uploads a video when I have to have mid-term exams
.tv
Yay! The map men are back! My favourite time of the week/month/how long since the last one?
Bok bok bok is comedy gold
11:03 / 11:13
Betterhelp is trash.
.bunghole lol
8:02 North Sentinel Island says hello
7:00 Looks like African ccTLD usage is still heavily skewed by foreigners registered to .ml, .gq, .cf, .ga. Most of these foreigners would be scammers and other shady actors, except possibly acadamics using .ac (Ascension Island) and Malaysians using .ml (Mali). In contrast, densely populated African countries like Egypt (.eg) and Nigeria (.ng) have a poor showing. I say this as a foreigner owning a .ng domain.
I used a .tk domain on my counterstrike source clan web page. It was one of the first ways to get a domain name that didn't have ".geocities" or ".angelfire" on your free template built website. I believe it even had a visitor counter at the bottom... Simpler times
And they never answered the question
The London Bridge Outro is majestic. Cursed AF, but Majestic.
10:00 "[...] why should the internet even need country codes? Isn't the idea of dividing the planet by nation states so 20th century? And the oposite of the internet is supposed to be about?"  It isn't. While in the most of the world we enjoy unrestricted internet, the internet still travels through the cables which are owned by someone and that someone lays them on someone's land. So while I definitely agree with "how it's used", the reality cannot be different. Another angle - if there is a "Centre d'internet" in France and I would be from Poland and el Presidento de la France decides he had enough of their anti-abortion laws and decides no more intenet addresses for you, it will very soon be a... discussion. (also there is an "internet backbone" which makes it centralized along some paths, decentralization is a lie)
The closing scene was brilliant 😂
The outro song made me chuckle
what kind of watch is Mark wearing?
The seatbelt "whoops" reminds me of Fry from Futurama when he fires the garbage ball into Space
The theme tune at the end is glorious!
bunghole even?
thank.u
Thanks!
I'm still waiting for someone to mention the Cook Islands with .co.ck
I had a .tk web domain in the early 2000s, it was free!
was wondering about this for a while.. nice timing
What’s up with the atrocious outline of the Netherlands? That’s not what the Netherlands looks like map men.
I am always thoroughly entertained by MapMen Youtube videos and I also learn lots of interesting things too.  Good job, boys!
OMG, Putin as the "lobbyist" for the Soviet Union? I'm dying!! LOL!!
Hi guys, I just wanted to say that your show reminded me a lot of old Bill Nye and gave me a very strange nostalgia boost while I was laughing my head off. Thank you for the unexpected boost of nostalgia and you guys are awesome!
7:47 Wrong, I have
"ats us nai" 😂😂
Really disappointed to see you guys take a BetterHelp sponsorship
Strictly speaking, a CV and a resumé as they are referred to in the US are somewhat different. A resumé is technically a 1 to 2 page summary of your CV, while a CV is an extensive and exhaustive list of academic certifications, skills, and work history. A resumé should always be tailored to the specific position that's being applied for, whereas a CV should have everything ever. For example, if you're applying for a new position in IT, you should include all your programming and administrative skills and positions while leaving out your prior retail work and unrelated education.
Dot Cat is the "country" code for Spanish region Catalonia jshsjsj
Glad Guernsey got a brief mention (.gg) one of the few reasons we ever get any attention. That and tax evasion
Sometimes I imagine that I live in a world where there are weekly episodes of Map Men... What a wonderful world this would be!
no mention of .int?
.frl not even mentioned, disappointed
Probably Tuvalu. Wait no, that’s .domains
My guess is it's .tv for Tuvalu
.nu is popular in Sweden and Denmark because it means now in Swedish and Danish.
The outro song made me laugh more than you'd think.
I'm guessing Tonga Islands .to
Wow, I haven't seen .tk mentioned in ages! It's quite nostalgic to me, when I was in high school, everyone had their own .tk website. It's also interesting that my country (the Netherlands) is so big on this map. I wonder why that is? (time to do another internet deep dive)
Too bad his name was not Jon PostAl.
@9:00 I love the dropping the greenscreen effect. Nice.
Yaaaaaayyyy map men!
Yaaaaaayyyy!!! Wait come back! 🤣
That music at the end was freaking hilarious! 🤣
Yaaaaaayyyy!!!
My former employer still holds the last .gb domain name in existence. No idea what it's used for. Something to do with X.400, probably.
Funny guys
Its .tv (Tuvalu)
This is a good video, but I feel that I have to downvote it simply for the betterhelp ad because they're sketchy as hell
I can't believe that Germany's .de is so popular considering how far behind Germany is with anything else internet related...
Big day for Torquay this.
I can't support someone advertising that predatory company. Betterhelp prays on vulnerable people and provides subpar care by unlicensed therapists. I thought you were better than this.
dudes... not betterhelp... youre better than that
It’s like all my Christmas came at once. Map Men and DNS explained in one video is just awesome. Thank you so much
.su domain was registered right before the soviet union dissolution by scientists from a research institute without thinking about it as a big deal. They kept it since it was claimed mostly for research purposes, and then as a legacy
0:01 tuvalu, because it is .tv --- 8:29 I was wrong
why better help tho
The sponsor segment was perfect  “Better help” “Butter help?” “Better help” “Better explain”
0:58 - not stricly true. with IPV6 (A standard that is over 20 years old!) uses numbers, letters and the colon, whereas IPV4 is numbers and dots.
oh my GOD the outro HURT
3:39 offensive map to see as a Latvian
8:00 it's rare that a Brit trying to do an American accent does anything other than "ultra cowboy", so good on you, mark
its .tk because you can get them for free
you guys are just trying to be funny. get outta here
I haven’t watched the video yet… it’s .tk for Tokelau.
fun nerd times :) DNS normally refers to "Domain Name Server", not system, but that's a minor thing.  More importantly, the "extended" TLDs, .info, .dog and so on, are not universally supported because they're not part of the original standard and for the same reason there are some of them that only work in the countries where they were created. Thus sites that use these TLD typically have to be registered as an alias of a "standard" domain, or alternatively point to a sub-domain (which in turn physically points to a folder on a primary domain) , in order to be universally accessible from anywhere. The mess this "supported, but not really" standard has caused, is why you don't see the extended 3-4-5 letter TLD very often
you did not even mention .co
Love this series, wanted to let you know that BetterHelp is a really insidious service. Their "therapists" have no qualifications, they steal private user data, and they don't provide any form of diagnosis (because they're not licenced professionals. They exploit mentally ill people by taking their money, providing them with no answers, keeping them in a cycle of paying again and again for their problems not to be solved. Don't take their money, they're a scam designed to rip off people struggling with their mental health. Only licenced professionals should be providing therapy.
Ats us nai!
I'm curious about the statistic of people who tuned off the video at around 3:43
Great stuff!
How did this video not have a Surfshark sponsorship?
its tuvalu
.tk websites. Nostalgia.
10:39 Spotted the magic words :D
It’s .tv I’m calling it (Tuvalu)
its cn for china.
Yay! Map men!
Get that betterhelp sponsorship tf outta here
As a britain the code is .co.uk or might be just .uk
Fun fact.  Tokelau is #48 in the list of most wanted ham radio DXCC entities.
Malo ni - a Tokelauan here (albeit one living in Sydney Australia). I watch your videos alot & did not expect my Motherland to turn up on a video 😂 🇹🇰🇹🇰🇹🇰🇹🇰🇹🇰🇹🇰
I bloody love when you put a video out
.io and .ai
Stop taking money from BetterHelp if you care about your credibility.
I was at the ICANN78 conference in Germany a few months ago! Really amazing to see how far the project has come.

So apparently .unicorn has restrictions on it. You have to be a "brand owner". So. Can some historian register CesareBorgia.unicorn and make a site commemorating the time he dressed up as a unicorn and danced in a ballet? Because that happened. He must have been beautiful.
Lol I think it's funny I did just see a video talking about that island a week or two ago.
2:07 John Postel was very prescient indeed in 1985 to worry about the world being overcrowded with web sites as the whole concept of the WWW was not invented by Tim Berners-Lee until 1989 ;)
No mention of the infamous .co.ck?
I was not ready to hear this😂😂😂  "The USA, which often considers itself the world's default county"
Strictly speaking (yes, I *am* 'that guy'), a C.V., or curriculum vitae, isn't the same as a resume.   The CV is a list of EVERYTHING you've done; every school you've attended, every certification you've earned, every job you worked at, every activity you've engaged in - it's basically your life history.    In contrast, a resume is an edited summary of your C.V. that's submitted to a prospective employer that lists only that part of your work/school/etc history *that is relevant to the job you're applying for*.  For example, you wouldn't put down babysitting experience before you turned 18 on an application to be a company's bookkeeper; on the other hand, you WOULD list that you'd taken a part-time job during uni working in the campus library, as the latter relates more to the accounting work you are applying for. (obviously, you'd note that you are a CPA prominently in the resume ;) )  A resume should be as short as possible, rarely over three pages, and focused on what the employer is interested in, but even a school student's C.V. already might be quite lengthy with activities and experience.
. TV Tuvalu
3:46 what episode of Phineas and Ferb is this?
Tuvalu (.tv)
there's paid partnerships you always skip on any other channels, and there's paid partnerships on Map Men's channels that you always watch in their entirety for their entertaining value.
7:35 yeah I have been using that one :)
I think it's fun that Wales has two TLDs, .wales and .cymru. They can distinguish English and Welsh/Cymraeg sites, like for the Senedd website. It's nice, but I wonder if it doesn't make website management more complex and more expensive, since you have to purchase two domains. Maybe Scotland, which uses only .scot, will introduce .alba for Gaelic soon.
What a wasted opportunity to use the laser-kiwi flag for New Zealand 😔 I really thought it would be something they'd do.
Do a video where you dress up as maps and you talk about men. Man maps, man maps, man man man man maps maps maps.
I didn't know about .tk but I knew about Tuvalu being the source of the .tv code! Does this make me a Map Man?
6:00 is .yu still active though? I saw it on geogessr recently. also, saw .fr in cyrillic in russia (federation of russia) once, which really threw me off. Does that count as a french site?
Very good video overall, just would like to correct that ICANN is the "Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers" and not "International Corporation..." Source: I worked at ICANN for 7 years.
Who even needs a ccTLD? My fiance and I have a website with the TLD ".wedding" to help not so tech savvy friends and relatives click a big "DIRECTIONS TO THE VENUE" button to open Maps.
Literally the only advert I've watched all the way through on YouTube in months.
Guys, where is ".io"?
The .cat tld is pretty tightly managed with regards to physical presence in Catalonia I recall.
A lot of Swedish website use .nu as "nu" means "now" in Swedish. Bingo for the island of Niue!
My favourite case of a country code TLD being used for something other than its country/territory is .tf, the country code for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, being used for websites relating to Team Fortress 2.
I've been watching for a few years now and am still enjoying thoroughly -   What if you did a video on the history of different roads in the uk? Dual Carriageways, motorways, etc
As someone who had a number of free .tk domains, of course I've heard of Tokelau!
I have been waiting for this video for such a long time…. 😀😄😆🤣
I don't need to guess it, I used to register a lot of TK domains as a young teenager, combined with 1asphost, for a nice portfolio of advert-rich zero-traffic websites for my crap band and various atrocious early 2000s pre-CSS websites.
You just antagonised the whole region of Catalunya with your .cat comment!
2:37 haha that was very Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy-esque
Yay!
Your end credit song is slightly out of tune.
.co.ck
@0:38 Ah yes, I remember the days of waffle iron drives. Took forever to load delicious information.
Even the sharing link for this video is a good example of one in practice! https://youtu.be/cD4hxKkqR4E
This is a serious question: has anyone ever see one of these guys blink?!?
noice
pisses me off when they say "soviet union broke up into so many countries" when in reality those countries existed before soviet union, they got "given" to the russians after the war with nazi germany, when they were consolidated into "war spoils", when dividing nazi occupied lands. poor countries went from one occupation to another. talk about bad luck
My prediction is Tuvalu 🇹🇻  with .tv
Small item that I would have found interesting: regions like the Basque Country (.eus) and Catalonia (.cat) also have their own TLD, even if they are not countries (yet)!
Disliked because of the betterhelp advert
i hate country codes that are also file extensions, like ".sh" and ".pl"
Funny how Jay Foreman is so far left his attitude to Jews has more in common with the far right, and yet he will shamelessly shill for any dodgy disreputable business.
Awful choice for a sponsor, really disappointing to see you guys like this
Seems to be, the domain is the only place for Germans to show national pride.
Are we sure that this internet thing is going to catch on?
I love this channel so much
i trust you, but, where are your sources? are they listed somewhere else?
Small mistake: the .cat domain is used by websites in the catalan language, or relating to Països Catalans (the catalan countries). So it's a domain area based on lingustics rather than national borders. The success of .cat started a trend followed by .eus for the basque country, .gal for galicia and so on. It has nothing to do with cats
Guessing before watching: .tv, .io, .ly, .co, in that order. Maybe also .to.
You can't seriously be taking betterhelp sponsorships? Please just look up the companies you work with because bh definetely is not one to go with.
I'm betting my life that it's Tuvalu    Edit: Ah fuck, guess I'll die
Map Man - Making the most boring, uninterestingly sounding topics into fascinating videos :D
Is it not .tv?
Maybe you shouldve added that tuvalu was scammed by someone for the management of TV for terrible free internet and a relaively small amount of money.
GAME GEAR DEPICTED, WAHOO!
I'm genuinely very surprised that one you didn't touch on is .io the fate of which is also tied up with the status of Chagos and Mauritius
03:45 Advert. Didn't they used to be at the end? I don't mind yours as they are amusing, but if I had to watch it more than once it might annoy.  Good video. Quality over quantity
So glad these guys are making videos again
Where can I find that tune that is played at the end? I want that as an alarm or door bell or ring tone.
I think if I had that many Patreons, I would only put out one video a month too ! 🙂
Great video as usual! Love the omage to Les Dawson at the end. Miss your live shows Jay!!
It was the beginning of the Internet.
What a beautiful outro music.
Love the Cue Dots before the advert .. little things 👌
as a web dev the first 10 seconds broke my brain 😂🤯
The London Bridge outro is vintage Jay comedy
At a previous job, we lamented that Eritrea didn't let foreigners use their coveted .er domain
One minor correction: (dot)cat is mostly for content in catalan, a language of Catalonia, a region of Spain, and one of the requisites is to promote that language
I already know. Its .tv
I actually have an .SU domain for my YouTube channel, but getting it registered and keeping it maintained is a bit of a nightmare. After Russia got cut off from SWIFT I had to get it transferred to a Ukrainian provider.
Not USA = foreign. Confirmed facts.
In fact I have heard of Tokelau! Huzah!
I loved the little stripey squared in top right to indicate and advert break
Oh god that credits song
Glad to see some Amstrad CPC text in there !
Not me pausing the video to try and read all the bits about the codes like .it, .gg
Hello from Denmark.   Yes there is a potential for catchy domain names with "nu" in them, but I can't remember seeing any in the wild?  There must be some. I just have a bad memory.   Buylego NU! Buylurpakbutter NU!
We call it a Curriculm Vitae or CV in Italy too!
Bold of you to assume I had never heard of Tokelau before
The intro be like #mapswithoutnewzealand
omg that outro theme is earr@pe. Nice work.
My dog hates the Internet, but she loved this mapmen, I suppose really she's a bitch 😮
Thanks for your service 🎉
.bunghole is definitely not a TLD, boys 🤨
YES! YES!
Of all the hidden details tucked away in the nooks and crannies of Map Men videos, I could never have anticipated spotting the hill, Roseberry Topping, that I can see from my apartment window right now. Are you stalking me, Jay Foreman?!
I really liked the videos but I didnt enjoy the fast cuts this time. However the editing is usually great. Kisses from Toscana
Wow i never know about this unique history about domain.  I thought it just normal happen on internet
Serbia has .srb
Umm, where is the laser kiwi flag please?
I love that you include the little ad break marker thing in the corner of the screen
Torquay! ❤
The obvious choice would be .tv for Tuvalu, but I can't think of anything that could possibly be bigger, so locking it in. Edit: and wrong! That was fun
The dutch government has over 1800 official websites ( it even includes a dating site 😂 ), im starting to think its to inflate the .nl 😂😂
what a beautiful telephone box. good
Hah, I knew! funnily enough it's an incredibly corrupt Dutch guy that's responsible for the .tk bullshit.
Oh god the outro song!
Friggin map men...where have these guys been
5:24 - Your inclusion of "ats us nai" is noted. Simple yet shows great attention to detail.
Tuvalu. Ooranoo
Awesome one guys, stylish as always 😌
1. NZ mentioned 2. I've heard of Tokelau, yeehaw
BASIC Nerd
Loved the hidden Rugrats reference!
didn't realise anyone cared that we were thinking of changing the flag lol
thank you for referencing the nz flag debacle
this was a super fascinating video 🤯
RED PEAK omg the NZ flag debate is still traumatic for me. So thanks for bringing it up again.  Also thanks for the semitone clashes in the outro tune. Just thanks all around really
Tuvalu, because its .tv bam
.tv
Great video, although I'm surprised there was no mention of the big old pyramid scheme from 15-20 years ago, revolving around the .ws country code. It was touted as the latest and greatest and implied to mean '.website' - In actual fact it was the country code of Western Samoa
Mark: "Tokelau." Jay: "Never heard of it." Mark: "Neither have I." Jay: (to camera) "Neither have you."  Me: "Yes I have!!"
Tokelau have heard of it ,part of NZ protectorate.
Indeed, I am not much surprised by the amount of .nl domains... I think I have about 4 at the moment? :P Besides there being a lot of web enthusiasts in the Netherlands, .nl is also a fairly cheap top-level domain! I wonder how many people watching this channel didn't know about Tokelau yet! I think it's a pretty well-known fact that it's the most common country domain. What I did not know though, is that the popularity of .tk was started by a Dutch guy! Although I guess that shouldn't have come as a surprise either... (: Wow!! The biggest thing I learnt was that 'ly' sounds like an adverb. I've never understood the weird name of 'bit.ly'!
My first custom domain I got was indeed a .tk back in 2007! Good times good times
I thought the most popular might be Colombia's "co" as a "com" alternative. Surprised that it wasn't mentioned.
Your outro is an unexpected gift of subtle hilarity
I do like to thank whoever made the hereliesjonpostelsuchalovelyandclevermanmissedbymany1943-1998 website, just so my next minute typing its entire URL didn't go to waste.  I sure hope that everyone reading this shall also choose to go through this struggle as I have.
love the subtle reference to the nz flag election at 2:36
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA NEW EPISOOOOODEEEEEEEEEEE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i got an .su domain, and because of the current conflict i now know why it's not a good idea to have a .su domain.
My favourite easter egg from this episode is: "The Witch Doctor" song. And as to not spoil the thrill of the hunt, I won't tell you where it is.
Very entertaining yet informative, well done.
The internet is wasps
that very last bit almost made me spit out my coffee xDD
I had a few .tk websites. No idea what they were now
One thing I find neat is how the .eu domain, nominally belonging to the European Union, is sometimes used by people from the Basque country, because the first two letters of the Basque names of the Basque Language and the Basque Country are eu.
I'll never guess it because why would I even want to know this......?
ccTLD exception of being two letters: .cat for Catalonia
DNS doesn't just allow for easier to remember names, it also allows the name of a website to stay the same even if the IP address changes across time or space.
Spot on with the NZ flags.
PromoSM
I'm very happy this is one time someone thought ahead when standardising these codes, making way for changing geography and ways of using the internet
thx for another brilliant episode
So pleased to see the Map Men back at what they do so well. Now I can look at this over and over to try to catch what I missed.
In The Netherlands, .tk was initially marketed as standing for "toekomst" (future), so I'm not surprised a Dutch guy was involved in it. And the word .nu means now.
I still type in URLs quite often (even if they autocomplete) and it is still quite important for a number of boring reasons (to me at least).
.tv domains are supposed to be an important source of revenue for the government of Tuvalu 🙂
.Biz 🤗💻
I desperately want the dissonant nursery rhyme outro as a ringtone. Desperately.
Video is a bit long. Can someone give me the TL;DR on TLDs?
Is it Tuvalu? That is my guess.
.cc - Cocos (Keeling) Islands Chinese companies: we'll get websites with this TLD and say it stands for "Chinese companies"
Where can I get that version of London bridge is falling down?
Shouldn't all the American states have their own ccTLD rather than all being under .us? Wouldn't that make more sense?
How come we don't see these two men on British national television? Shouldn't they get their own TV show of some sort?
Betterhelp use unqualified 'therapists' and are basically just a chat room, I wish people would stop accepting their ad buys.
Pre-watch prediction Its going to be about Tuvalu because they have .tv
Neat
Love that
It's the Cook Islands. I don't even need to watch the video.
10:39 Witch Doctor lyrics
Always amusing and educational ... even noticed the little old fashion rolling sync block in the top right corner before the advert break   love it
Its insane how much effort you put into this… you write a whole cv just to flash it for half a second and no one even reads about the amazing cod enjoyer
Stay away from betterhelp. They took advantage of me when I was at my lowest and tried extorting me for more money. The advice they gave was always biased in their interests. Please mapmen, don’t support them.
been using betterhelp for a month now, it is great
A new MapMen video. Yay, YMMD. 😊
Better help is being sued by the US government for illegally selling user health information and deceptive marketing to indicate that they don't sell your information at all. I think you need to find better sponsors. I'm sure the developers and therapists that work for better help want to help, but the company just wants to sell your info.
As a German, I approve of this map projection.
The US’s treatment of .us is like the modern day version of the UK’s treatment of stamps. We’re the only country that doesn’t put our country name on stamps.
fun fact, .cat is actually a pseudo cctld, for catalonia, with a requirement to host catalan language content
Evil Edna! 🤣🤣🤣  9:25
Lol I love all our flags (caller from New Zealand)
I like the fact that when Yugoslavia broke up, Montenegro's ccTLD went from .yu to .me
Please DO NOT accept sponsorships from Betterhelp, they’re a disgusting company and I can’t believe you didn’t do 5 minutes of research and instead let them line your pockets like that
Your back 😊
Before watching this im gonna make a prediction that its .tv
I'm reminded of the sitcom Nathan Barley where his website was registered in the Cook Islsnds so it could be .co.ck, pronounced dot cock.
I laughed so hard at the New Zealand having six flags on the whatismyflag website at the start. I really appreciate that our flag fiasco gets to be a joke on this channel because it was a joke when it happened as well. Anyway I still think the laser kiwi flag should've won.
When I clicked on this video, I thought "Surely it's not .tk" But holy crap, it was. By far. I remember when everybody I knew was grabbing as many .tk domain names as they could when they first started giving them away for free.
Betterhelp operate in some fairly problematic ways and a lot of the public are boycotting YouTubers that still accept their sponsorships, might be a good idea to research them a little bit if you’re unaware of the stuff going on
The internet is such a strange, interesting place.
Crossing my fingers for some representation of .co.ck
The fact that the intro link works is just too silly I respect the fact that you bought a domain just for the purpose of an introductory joke that only about a 3rd of viewers would actually look up!
Thank you. <3
you're the only content creators whose adverts i actually watch.  Because they're bloody brilliant.
If you have both a developmental disorder (like autism) and a personality disorder (like bpd) better help will try and find you a specialist but won't actually ever find one
.bok
Roblox.eeee
It's .tv or .ch, isn't it?   Edit:  I heard about the .tv popularity in a different video. What I misremembered is that China wants to get the .ch from Switzerland but the Swiss aren't planning to give their country code away anytime soon.  .... was that also a Mapman video?
Really enjoyed this
Tax write off holiday I see 😂
Oh, come on! You were the last people I thought would succumb to Better Help’s massive reputation laundering campaign. Are you really that desperate for cash? Are you really too busy to do just a tiny bit of research into the many damaging behaviors BH has engaged in, including selling user data without consent? Are you really so gullible to believe this technology platform’s claims that it cares about its customers (both naive clients and desperate therapists) when it is so obvious it cares only for its investors? How much money did they give you—and was it worth the damage you are doing to your own reputation by shilling for such a greedy, ethics-free, and scandal plagued outfit?  So many questions.
My extremely niche knowledge of ISO codes came in handy for this video. very cool
loved the microtonal music at the end
Before watching I'm gonna guess it's .ck
It's been awhile
You never added URL to the glossary.
Guessing it’s .TV for Tuvalu
oooh eeee oohahhahh ting tang wwallahwallah bing bang.  iykyk
This internet already just comes at you like wasps.
Now I'm wondering: If Scotland ever decides to secede from the .uk, what would its new ccTLD be?  Because the obvious .sc (Seychelles) and .sk (Slovakia) are already taken.  As are .so (Somalia), .st (São Tomé and Príncipe), .sl (Sierra Leone), .sa (Saudi Arabia), .sn (Senegal), and .sd (Sudan).  Guess they'll have to settle for .sq.
What about Tonga? .to
Tuvalu
I've heard of Tokelau
Sweet lord that closing song! My ears demand restitution 😵‍💫
3:41 - "End of Part 1" Jingle is spot on. We need more of it!
I find it amusing that you claim people don't type in domains anymore, while simultaneously showing URLs on-screen that people would have to type into their browser.
5:28 wait, hold on..
.tf moment
"Thankfully for our costume budget" - ROFLMAO
7:10 here is the answer. top 3 is  de cn and uk
As always great work love Map Men education .
Tom Scott never disappoints  🔥🔥
9:53 I thought .nu is famous for porn site
is it not .tv for tuvalu
A very normal intro song!!! 😍
is it .TV for Tuvalu ??
and they are already on the top trending. and they absolutely deserve that
Shout out to the Cook Islands, whose domain is .co.ck
¡Gracias!
Before having watched the video - It's Tuvalu, isn't it?
I know you need to make money but im thoroughly disiapointed in you accepting a betterhelp sponsor. They are...an awful company with super shady practices.
3:42 I got two actual ads at the ad break
I've heard of it! I used to have a .tk domain in the 00's
Here’s the answer to the title: 6:33
.ky cayman islands
.tv owned by the pacific nation Tuvalu surely. That's where they make most of their national income, by selling rights to the use of ".tv".
i'm the proud owner of an arfff.dog domain
Fun story about the many NZ flags thing; From what I recall we had two official referendums (votes) regarding the flag change.  The first vote was basically an announcement and asked us what flag we wanted as the new one.  The second (much later) vote asked if we ACTUALLY wanted the flag to be changed or not.  It was essentially a publicity stunt for free media coverage by the party at the time, and it worked. But pretty much every Kiwi was confused by being jumped by a sudden flag change vote BEFORE being told they were even allowed to vote for if they wanted to keep it or not.  Most Kiwis didnt want to be forced to change the flag without being asked first, hence why most decided to keep the same flag and we essentially went, 'Yeah, nah' to the new designs.  Still think we should've gone with the laser-eye kiwi flag design though
Glad you gave the "rest in peace" URL a RESTful architecture.
6:40 Shouldn’t Taiwan be a wee bit bigger, seeing as how it apparently has 1.2M sites, 3x as many as Palau right next to it?
Isn't BetterHelp the company that was found pressuring its vulnerable clients into giving up sensitive data, and then sharing that data with third parties illegally so bad that the FTC had to step in?
wtf... i thought DNS meant dedicated name server
I checked, and Jon Postel does indeed have hair rather like that.
I really enjoyed this video, thank you!
Back in the naughts, the manager for .ph tried to market the domain to phone companies.
That's kind of hilarious that Canada has twice as many as the US...
BUT WAIT!  If Mark is getting a divorce (as indicated by his foodless BBQ), will he be known as Mark Cooper or Mark Jones?
After watching this I want to listen to Witch Doctor, for some reason, wink, wink
It’s .TV, there I guessed it. Like if I was right.
is it .tv
The "You wha?" and "ats us nai" for Northern Ireland were spot on
This outro music is even funnier than the last one :D  Made my day
London Bridge has got compressed, got compressed, got compressed!  London Bridge has got compressed, like a jpeg
The outro is so cursed 💀
9:02 music name?
Actually, there may be some law implications from using specific ccTLDs. At least some companies use or did use ccTLDs to differentiate the contents (to adhere the local law) on the matching ccTLD, while for other domains asserting, that the are clearly not meant for citizens of that country, and this way absolving themselves from responsibility from stuff published under these other domains. Like, EU countries have this "right to be forgotten", but perhaps under other TLDs that content doesn't need to be blocked. Or Thailand has these very strict rules forbidding any offense to royals (or maybe just the king), but maybe it can be limited to .th.
*whispers* Wow, that's where Boney used to live
Fun fact about ccTLDs. .cat is not about cats at all, it's for the Spanish region of catatonia. This is because back in the day one of the people on the board for deciding what ccTLDs there were was himself a proud Catalan. I believe they still restrict it to things pertaining to the Catalonia and don't let people make sites about felines with .cat
It’s like watching an educational Monty Python
Yes, my college radio station figured out how to contact some government person in Micronesia to buy a .fm website. (It actually simplified our web address down to just the 4 call letters, .fm. The old website was the college name, edu, a slash and then our call letters a dash and radio, or something. It was a pain if you didn’t remember to immediately bookmark it so you didn’t have to type it in again.
.tk.   I've been known this...❤
FUCK BETTERHELP
truly the most American thing of all time
1:45 Kanye West - 24
9:50 LETS GOOOOOOOOO LONG ISLAND MENTIONED LETS GO METS BABY
what about .to? :o
Aha! I know tokelau and also the certain Mary's statue in the middle of a lagoon. Coz I spent way too much time on Google map in hope of a day like this when I can prove to map men that I am an ultra nerd.
I do love map men, and I’m stoked to see their return. One lingering thought after this video though (as much as I enjoyed it)…  Was this video even about maps?  Yes, I know there was a map. And the scale of countries according to how many ccTLD registrations was pretty cool. But the link is fairly tenuous at best. Better rename yourselves “Internet Guys” if you intend on making more content like this. Not saying that’s a bad thing, just something was niggling the back of my brain here and I’m sure you know hard it is to reach that spot for a good scratch…
5:43 The URL works, by the way. They just didn't setup the HTTPS certificate correctly for the www subdomain so it will throw a cert warning with the full URL at the time of this writing.
map men
🕴"It has the smallest economy in the world." 🕴
_"The Internet will just come at you like wasps."_  😆 It feels a bit like that already on mobile.
I need to know what the little box in the upper right at 3:40 is. Its purpose has been bothering me for a while. I assume it’s a V-chip joke, but not sure if that was a USA only thing
Best in-video ads . Clever and funny a tough trick to acheive.
Most enterprise IT people have heard of TK... it was easier to block it totally as its all scams. DNS blackhole it.
Wow. That ending song. Reminds me of a horrible version of Chopsticks...
You always make my day better, and can magically transform a bad day into a good one.  Thanks you kindly!
.tv?
As a professional musician and music teacher who loves to mess with student’s minds, I really appreciated the end-credits music.
Man man map man map map map man man
Thank you.  I needed this
the spinning wheel thing on the top right before the commercial bit is fun
The only ads on YouTube that I NEVER skip!
.cat is actually not for cats (although it is oftent use for that purpose) but for catalan language websites.  The conditions of use specify that the site must contain content in catalan, sites that do not comply may face termination.
(5:15) uk is a valid alias for gb in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
"the internet is falling down falling down falling down, the internet is falling down rip jon postel"
Like wasps.
(3:15) Actually ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 That standard contains three variants: alpha-2 (2 letters), alpha-3 (3 letters), numeric (3 digits). It would have been funny if you used the full name. Also ISO is read as a word: iso, not as three letters.
That jab to IBM, at 5:35 , so majestic. 😂😂😂
So now you made a video related to physical layer and application layer. I wonder how the other layers could related to a map
The slow-mo guys are looking a little off 🧐
Maybe there will be tld: .angga
Yay, always a treat!🎉
seriously the most entertaining/educational combination I know.  I suppose I can think of funnier people, but not many, and you guys make the weirdest stuff absolutely riveting. And very good for slightly modifying my overall worldview.
Love the outro music 🙏
I need more content of differing variety from these two modern monty python fools
👍
5:43 the joy in my heart when I typed in that link and it actually led to a website
An equally valid naming scheme that was also considered was having the TLD at the beginning (e.g. com.youtube.www). In the alternate universe where this was adopted, it was Malaysia (my) that made bank.
It seems to me that the mistake was using country codes instead of language code. If is used language codes such as .es for Spanish (Español), .de for German, po  for Portuguese, ni for Japanese (Nihongo), etc it would make some kind of sense. The domain would represent what language the site is in rather than a country.
you put the imperial one as 'uk.ac.ucl' is this some kind of sick joke, mr foreman?
Hiii
i thought .tk would be perfect for… tiktok?
Before watching the video, I'm preshoting Tuvalu with .tv
I used .tk domains for school projects - and for Rick Rolling people.
Can anyone get me a track id on the closing song pls and thank you. Excellent acoustic rendition of a critically acclaimed banger. P.s Mark if you ever read this I poured you a pint once working at a pub on Portobello road.
.yo its the .mapmen
It's a common misconception that org is for non-profit organizations, but it was actually intended to be an "organizational domain" for things that didn't fit neatly into any other category.  Also, ga used to be a free ccTLD which is probably why it's so over-represented compared to the rest of Africa.  And us is s crappy registrar with crappy privacy policies which requires that you list your full legal name, home address, and phone number on the registrations, so it's no wonder nobody wants to use it.
The song at the end is possibly the most awful thing I have ever heard. 10/10
Jokes on you boys. I used to have a .tk domain so I was well aware of Tokelau!
Funny ad, shame it's for BetterHelp
"cat ninja pizza unicorn" you can tell those were set up circa 2009-12
YO more map men is based
Crapiots
Oh man. As a teenager I got my first domain from .tk because I was broke and had no credit card.  I used it to host pictures for my avatar and signature on forums.
Im so happy there’s new stuff, I was reduced to watching people reacting to your old videos 😭 😂
Another great episode!
.au just (as in in the last 9 months) became a ccTLD.   In fact, the CSIRO (who have done and still do a lot of good work on the tech front) have had a .au TLD for their domain for at least a decade…maybe more.
Nice Futurama reference at 10:40  Also “.ting .tang .wallahwallah .bing .bang” was marvellous
.tk ?
Imagihe this video's view count if they each watched it 100 times!  (This was written at 400,000 views)
My guess is Tuvalu. Makes up a huge percentage of their GDP.  Damn. So I guess it's .CN then. Y'all didn't actually say lol.
I went to all the urls they said in the intro and they all redirected to Pronhub…
the music at the end made my head spin
is it tuvalu? im not gonna watch the vid
I guessed it
Ats us nai.
Fun to see the SpaceJam website from the 90s pop up at the beginning, it still works by the way and hasn't really been changed except to continue working.
I had a professor in college who referred to IBM as "Itty Bitty Machines"
THE WEBSITE IS REAL OMFG
Bahahaha I knew you guys were too nerdy for that not to actually be a website on the gravestone. Beautiful.
Uhhhh isn't that sponsor the one that sold people's private medical data? Illegally??? Oh well this was a good channel while it lasted
legends
Is this an old MapMen video from years ago?  Because I thought Mark and Jay had gone separate ways.
Never actually looked forward to a promotional bit until you two came along
Why are people still taking better help sponsorships
you need to get some help choosing a better sponsor that doesn’t sell patient data to facebook for ads
As a Canadian, I am obligated to say thank you for having our flag in the video and recognizing thay we are, in fact, a real country
i'm going to guess tuvalu because it's .tv and if i'm wrong i will cry
.ca club!
Omg the nz flag bit is great 🎉❤
Not only have I heard of Tokelau, I have friends from there. Couldn't call them until 1997.
tuvalu
Interesting
I feel like there's gonna be some weirdness in how to represent the .su country code.
.cat it's not for the animal, it's for the region Catalonia in Spain https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.cat And the rules says this domain must include a version of the page in catalán, but http.cat doesn't have a catalán version 😅
What a banger outro
I got a cert mismatch error (though only for the full URL), resolved by removing the "www." – something someone can fix? In any case, thank you for that. I just knew you would :)
Torquay mentioned 🎉
Better help sucks tho
Onion domain names are missing
you forgot .museum the oldest new tld
London bridges falling down at the end 😂
7:46 Au contraire, my dearest map men. I've heard of it. I've even looked it up on Wikipedia after having a .tk domain for years. This TLD was very popular among my 14-year old aspiring webdeveloper friends, back in 2004.
6:22 >Go to an SU domain >It takes your money and violates your privacy Poetry.
i just had the most full body reaction to that outro (also props to all the lil country explainations those were fun)
Wow... a bit creeped out. In the same moments when I was _literally_ thinking, "Why don't we ever see '.us'?", you two answered it. Get outta m'head! 😂
i've heard some pretty awful rumors about betterhelp. a little disappointed to see you partner with them but it's not the end of the world
Such cute boys ❤
Re: that bit at the end: Before you get internet-enabled cybereyes, make sure they have good spam and virus filters, and keep them up to date.
Excellent video once again
upset by the lack of trashbat
Me: _Reads title_  "It's Tokelau. No question."
Brilliant video.
Is it .tv?
Disappointed that you're accepting money from a sponsor who hires unvetted homophobic therapists
Im gonna call it for Niue's .nu TLD before I watch this.  Edit: oh how wrong I was.
I thought .br would be much larger than it is, but then I remembered that, for a long time, the .br registrar not only was a bit strict on registration rules but also way more expensive than just getting one of the six classic TLDs, the only issue was having to pay in dollar.
So in the end, the USA actually has it right by not caring about country codes at all.
Why no laser kiwi?
I thought it was going to be .co.ck
I’m surprised there was no joke about .co.ck which can’t be used for the obvious because the Cook Islands have catholic sensibilities
Before watching the video, I will guess:  Libya or Tuvalu
i'm guessing that it's .tv from tuvalu
I already knew. I knew not just from another video but because I used it over 20 years ago for a website.
As someone from Northern Ireland, I appreciated the translations at 5:21 and 5:24
Love the toasted sandwich maker! 🤣
I assume the Americans were just copying what the UK has always done with stamps. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp_design#Country_name
I personally like the .xyz tld.
My favourite men from the UK, both tall, slim, cute, sensitive and sensible as well😊😅❤
So... Why does South Georgia, of all places, appear on this map?
0:58 hey that is a local IP, you won't find anything cool there unless you host it yourself.
5:14 Actually, Northern Ireland is not in the UK. It's in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
0:00 Let me guess, is it .tk, or Tokelau? I know they just give them away for free so that's my best guess.
My guess: .tv
Why are there two .cs at 5:59  ?
Fuck you guys are funny.
Funni New Zealand flags
huh, this is how i learned .tk stopped doing free domains, wild
The Cook Islands are pretty strict about who they allow to use their cctld. Not surprising given it’s .co.ck  As Nathan Barley would say…well weapon!
i guessed it
https://youtu.be/cD4hxKkqR4E?t=654 me at music lesson
Cool
Good job! Very enjoyable.
Man, Rhett and Link really fell off
Any mental health service that needs advertising should be steered well clear of
Better Help are scammers
A new map men video makes for a good day.
😊 Map Men is back 😒 They’re sponsored by scammers
That was perhaps the best video I have ever seen on YouTube. It answered a question I have wondered about for years, it was funny , and even the ad was top shelf. 10/10.
ICANN is a corrupt org that sells blackmail gTLD
I can’t believe it’s not I can’t believe it’s not better help. And I believe there may be a lot more better help out there… wearing a cunning disguise.
Before watching the video: is it .ly from all of those Web 2.0 names?  EDIT: Damn.  Crazy that .tk finally got slapped down; aren't they one of like 2 or 3 locations that relied on the income of their TLD for a majority of their GDP?  That's going to become an issue if so :x
as someone who typed in the website at 5:42 with and without the rest/in/peace i now truly appreciate the work everyone working for the channel does.
Is it .TV? Tuvalu got rich because of it.
9:49 stop at the right time and check out the youtube link hahaha
If I had a nickel for every time Map Men referenced the Sega Game Gear, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
This is the only video of yours I actually knew about. Love the channel, keep up the great work. I used to own a lot of .tk domains since they were free.
Given how crazy for the USA so many of my fellow stateside people are, it's kind of wild that there's not a patriotism-fueled rush to not just use but over-use the .us code
Bongo
Great editing, I really loved it! 😍
That is the worst rendition of London Bridge is falling down that I have ever heard … where can I play it on loop?
.cat is for catalonia hahaha
Guesses TK for Tokelau from the title. I haven't seen it in awhile though but it was really big in the 00s and I think most who used the web then would know it.
7:47 Yes i have, i grew up with a Red Grammar album... He rhymed it with Moscow.
I think this is the first time ever that I upload a video based on the AD in it LOL  Rest of the video was also fun and great but that one made me laugh so hard
Guessing know that it’s .tv, and I’ll eat my shit if I’m wrong
7:30 ah yes i love going to dunno
Name an internet video series funnier and more informative than Map Men. I’ll wait.
How the are YouTubers still reccomending better help. Its borderline immoral to reccomend that trash.
Yeah freenom who did .tk and a few others died about a year ago quietly, just stopped letting people renew their domains and since it was only a max of 12 months for free i imagine most of the domains are gone now
(Before watching) Tuvalu? 🇹🇻
The outro is amazing
I thought my life was completely fucked  And then you brought out another video   Thanks, Guys
GO MUM!
Hill in North Yorkshire briefly referenced?? Time to get obnoxious
Roseberry topping??? The wonky nipple of the north york moors visible in its bleak beauty from blakey ridge???? Fuck yeah
That walls of jericho outro was something i did NOT expect when clicking on the video
I haven't watched but my guess is tuvalu's coz it's .tv
Blind Guessing Federated States of Micronesia
TOKELAU!!!!!
At least one map where Germany reigns supreme.
Well that was fun
5:09
Map Men videos have me pausing and checking the backgrounds and looking up weird-ass URLs in a way I haven't since Homestar Runner was still doing Flash animations.
good video, but where can I see a map men discussion of the Beginning of the Internet
Christmas island babyyyyyy
I'm not going to watch this video. I just clicked to comment Who the hell cares? Like, seriously
tld(r): missed the opportunity to call them Postel-codes.
London bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down...
ccTLDs should have been called Postel codes 😂
Who else remembers typing DNS codes into their xBox 360 when GTA V Online came out?
im gonna guess it's .tk or .tv
I guess I couldn’t guess but I did know.
I remember the days of .tk when it was the easiest way to get your own domain name. It used to be more than spam!
luv the tiny detail of the advert cue dots, nice touch
Hi, funny and informativa as ever, ❤. I don't agree, though, on your use of the term "website" in the context of 1980, when the world wide web simply did not exist... But I like all the rest!
Ok, okay-ok-ok....  map fellas:  if you're gonna show a cartoon world map of USA (with surrounding areas) "Ayzhia" goes on the left.
I don’t know why but that final joke was absolutely hilarious
How on Earth is Squarespace not sponsoring this video?
That outro is on some Don Van Vliet level
It’s IO isn’t it Edit: Wow it wasn’t
Never a dull day with the Map Men around!
“The internet will just come at you like wasps”
Bit sad that you spent a bit of time talking about the Pacific Islands and you didn't mention the Cook Islands... You know... .co.ck 😅
Another super witty, top draw video again from YTs best map-educationally rounded but funny channel. Even your paid partnership parts are well worth watching! Thank you both for this brilliant way of understanding whatever map topic it is, you are gifted at making all the learning part fun and I can never wait till the next video.😀😎👍❤🗺
dot.mapmen
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees, Xmas arrived early! Miss the Map Men so much, thank you so much for another riveting video!!
I love how every time someone comes up with a good system, give it 10 years and it is  illogical/nonsense.😂
Haven’t watched the video yet, but my guess is .tv
Seems like these vids put more attention to the funny sponsor's content than to the content itself.  Step back
2:37 no laserkiwi?
Is .ar not labeled in the map? 6:34
.cat is for Catalonia
Ads already feel like wasps
TLD R
I have notifications on for this channel but youtube didn't notify me of this upload.
new map man dropped ?!?!
It is quite amazing that you can advertise an app-based therapy service on a ten minute internet video and nobody will bat an eye. If it were something like app based knee surgery I think more people would be having second thoughts about it. Just goes to show how undervalued mental health really is
If you don't like this channel, I don't like you.
Without watching. I’m gonna guess .nu is on the lists because it’s Dutch for now. Edit: I am severely disappointed and my day is ruined
Im guessing before i watch, is it Tuvalu?
my guess: tuvalu, b/c it's .tv
That rendition of London Bridge is Falling Down at the end is absolutely brilliant! I want it as my ringtone!
They actually bought the domain…
BTW, a domain doesn't actually have to be in the DNS to get translated into an IP. Your computer has a file called "hosts" that lists all the names for computers connected on your local network along with their physical addresses. It also lists a bunch of domain names and their IP addresses. If your domain name server removes an entry for a website (e.g. because of government censorship), you can get around that block by adding the name to your hosts file. (Or if you're a maniac, you can memorize the IP and type it into your browser's location bar directly.)
Tuvalu! -> .tv (No, haven't yet watched ^^)
Was expecting the Cook Islands for a mention -  “.co.ck”
Could someone send me Anna’s email or phone number? Her eyes are magnetic. I dream of us sitting down for some beef butter toast and soup. (I do hope that’s not too culturally insensitive)
UK also funnily matched the Ukrainic language code so that many people landed on Boris Johnson when they actually were targeting for Victor Yanukovich.
C64 basic looping "I AM A NERD"
I've missed you guys. ❤️ ❤❤
In Belfast, landing home after finishing work, sticking the kettle on, new episode of Map Men: 'Ats us nai!
Thanks for putting in all of the New Zealand flags, and great Mary had a little lamb cover at the end
I'm tempted to form a company purely to get it advertised here!
Wasps doing come at me
I dont like the outro music :(
I can't believe you made an orgy joke lmao
Typical Brits, and forgot Malta on the map. First 1956 and now this, you have no shame gentleman. (note, .mlt was on the second map.... so it's like you heard me)
did u say unprofessional therapist? hahahah accurate
I see u have a norn iron consultant 😂
That outro song made me have a stroke
Only in America people dream in red white and blue, and we dream as big as we want to.
Once again, thank you very much!😃🧡
My favourite internet men
It’s the beginning of the internet
just fyi, i know every company has their problems, but better help is a really bad service that has directly negatively impacted people’s mental health, as a single extreme example, there’s stories of these overworked, non-background checked therapists telling gay people to kill themselves— i would at least look into it before deciding whether to continue working with them
Where did you get the jingle music at the end? Love it.
I figured it was going to be Tuvalu.
1:06 I'm not sure if the residents of Rutland will thank you for the huge boost to their tourism industry.
I’ll take 3 or 4 mapmen vlogs a year 😊
Gonna guess it right now when the opening ad rolls: Tuvalu
damn i was 4 hours late.
Is .supercalifragilisticexpioulidotius an option?
0:24 No, it does not show all the registered CCTLDs on the DNS system! There are at least two - .sj and .bv - missing!!! Now you will have to make another video about them!
Holy shit its Mep Man!
Love the Map Men vids - shame about the ad... Surely you can do better,,,
Men bac
why are they called Map Men???
My absolute favourite YouTube channel!  “Not biased”, he says with his geography degree ;)
.bok .bok .bok  I laughed
Did anyone else lose it at bok bok bok bok bok bgaaaaaark?
No mention of .io :(
5:42 was absolutely fantastic
I still have several .tk domains registered. It seems Freenom (the registrar for .tk domains) allow you to renew existing domains, but not register any new ones. Edit: all of my freenom domains are now in a frozen state, meaning I can't manage them nor move them to a different registrar
The fact that Canada did not get *.EH* is a huge missed opportunity. Also funny how positive he was about North Korea getting internet before they were getting food.
So, after all that, what IS the most popular country code?
No mention of the Cook Islands’ .co.ck?
I had to slow down to 0.5x speed (and pause) to catch all the country codes at the end!
BEEF. BUTTER.
BetterHelp is a company that has many egregious practices that are detrimental to mental health support.
You forgot the super-old ".int" from the list of first TLDs; there were actually 7. (and if we want to be pedantic, there is also .arpa used in reverse DNS and infrastructure)
The co in .co.uk is not a TLD, as it is not the top level domain, it is thus the second level domain.
Well if there is no limit on guesses I’ll guess the most popular country code eventually!
Funny.nice/thank.you
The Cook Islands unfortunately were assigned .ck, making their domains all end in co.ck.
5:42 You didn't buy the hereliesjohnpostelsuchalovelyandclevermanmissedbymany1943-1998 domain for that joke!? 🤣🤣
Awesome!!!
0:59 -- You show IP address 192.158.1.38, which is really close to RFC1918 space (192.168.0.0/16), but I think you got one number wrong and are accidentally referring to the US Veterans Administration Medical Center. Intentional?
domain naming is a mess, what a mess, such a mess domain naming is a mess, and no~one~cares!
I was half expecting the Cook Islands to be top - who doesn't their domain to be .co.ck after all?
Is the ending song on Spotify please
Should've been a disclaimer for Pointless fans. We all knew what was coming.
https://youtu.be/cD4hxKkqR4E?t=218 Juuuust a small bit wrong there, cz instead of cs [Czechoslovakia] (later in the video shown correctly) Ah, to whom am I talking anyway :D
betterhelp is a disgusting company that supports the genocide of the palestinian people, i expected better from you
I normally have to watch Map Men videos a few times, looking for those little extras they put in.  Even the Unfinished London videos were full of them.  Well played Jay, Mark and the rest of any team you have helping you.
UK: Invents stamps, becomes default country, all foreign countries need a name on their stamps US: Invents cc domain names becomes default country, all foreign countries need a name on their dot cc's.
finally, Switzerland with internet sea access!!
Hello Jay and Mark. In response to you previously saying Yorkshire, UK did not really exist, I thought it should have a three letter suffix, but thought better of this at "YUK".
7:30 And there it is. It only took you Limeys seven and a half minutes to get to the anti-US bullshit.
.com!
Yay love your vids. I learnt something today x
Haven’t watched the video, it’s gonna be .tv for Tuvalu
Really disappointed with having BetterHelp as a sponsor.
Torquay mentioned 🎉🎉🎉
I'm so thankful you included my 4 year old niece's performance of London Bridge as the outro music for this video
I want to change my domain name to .splunge
Map man is back?!?!
Throwing shade at New Zealand when we spent $18mil on a new flag referendum and ultimately ended up keeping what we already had? Nice.
Hey, more things I never consider. Thank You for forcing me to consider it.
Interesting.
My guess before I see the vid: Tuvalu
please dont support betterhelp , theyve been knwon to sell your data and not vet hiring very well at all :(
i want some beef butter can you bring that ad back up
Pumping my fist wildly in the air for the return of BEEF BUTTER
Sometimes I imagine that I live in a world where there are weekly episodes of Map Men... What a wonderful world this would be!
Though this would be a boring video about Tuvalu but it wasn't and it wasn't about Tuvalu.
So why do so many people want to use Tokelau's letters and why does Tokelau want to let them? Because money and because money.
In an alt universe, Microsoft originally called their products DOS MS and Paint MS, and now use a bottom lvl domain of ms. instd of .ms
Lol @ 4,000
Please don’t stop making videos unless I’m dead.
Fun fact: .cat is mostly being used by Catalonia and is one of their main symbols of national independence. Most governmental institutions in Catalonia use .cat instead of .es.
Guessing Tuvalu before watching the video (because of Twitch).  Darn, the title stands true
....as an American, I legit didn't know .us was a thing.  I've never encountered it, and thought country codes were like...modifiers to get to non-US versions of websites.
Im goin thru and readin all the background notes on the country codes and when i got to 9:49 Iraly (which flashes by almost instantly unless set to 0.25x playback lol) i had to check and see if brexit is a website; happy to report it is, sad to report its just a spam page with ads for probs viruses or scams or other malware
I saw that. 10:39 I'm not allowed to escape that damn song, am I?
You guys make the only videos that make me want to rewatch the commercial. Someday, people will pay for exposure like that.   Only half way through but I bet I know the winning country code. I even have a disused domain there. If I’m right.
it's tuvalu, right?
VINCENT! I know you are watching this.
If the answer isn't Tuvalu. I'd be shocked
The internet coming at me like wasps is basically Twitter
The only channel where even watching the advertisement is funny!
9:49 So again pausing on every 1/10 second to read what’s shown on the screen.
Always Remember BetterHelp sells your sensitive health information:  https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/03/ftc-says-online-counseling-service-betterhelp-pushed-people-handing-over-health-information-broke
Outro music ftw.
Christmas day ALREADY!!!! No, it’s Mapmen’s day …😊
That AI joke hit the nail in the coffin. It's hard to feel workers won't be replaced if AI becomes the cheaper option when we have just witnessed years of fear with millions dead from disease, instead of the few weeks it would have been if we had been allowed to not work and stay at home.
9:30 Woox cameo
Just noticed how similar the logos of better help and the Camden Borough council are! Thanks Mapmen for this!
Xmas comes early this year
I hate that so many folk i watch and listen to are advertising better help. They charge you more money for less than youd get from a private therapist and their selling point is the kind of flexibility you could get from many private therapists too.  Fuck better help; we should be encouraging people in distress to seek out an actual therapist.
I enjoyed the video but I am a bit sad about your sponsorship of BetterHelp as a very long time viewer. They are not a good company. I normally like your advert segments, but this one is just disappointing to me.
Malaysia be like: Hahaha “.my” ccTLD is better😂
Someone already registered the domain for the grave lol, nice
That ad was a masterpiece.   There's a sentence I wasn't expecting to write in 2023.
10:46 What a marvelous stride! 😁👌
3:37 incorrect map: .cz split into .cz and .sk in 1993
Thanks for this. I've always wanted a TLDR on TLDs.
did everyone forget betterhelp's shady past
8:16 how many takes did this take for you guys to give up and keep the laugh in at the end?
TORQUAY MENTIONED, YESSSSSS
Disappointed you took money from better help after all they have done over the years  Which includes, selling peoples data, failing to protect people's private health information and falsely claiming to use qualified councilars when they weren't. They werent even hiring people with experience.
Before I watch, I'm guessing Tuvalu because I think a lot of people would want a .tv
really wanted the british indian ocean territory (or whatever it's called, look the uk has a truckload of random territories and empire fragments lying around ok) CCTLD to be brought up... .io
Funniest case I've had over the years with this was visiting and registering on multiple Habbo Hotels which at some point had all different looking buildings xD ah yes the ol" days of internet.
I’m guessing it’s Tuvalu, as it’s got TV
Now I can sleep well before my final tomorrow
Jay at 3:38 you forget TM as Turkmenistan
IDN TLDs? Anyone?
I am a nerd I am a nerd I am a nerd I am a nerd  [...and so on...]
Love the rendition of London Bridge at the end
Oh my gosh ... they actually got Jon Postel to show up in the episode. Their budget must be insane!
btw superb guitar performance!
Guessed it! Props me
peak humour
As user 2865 on the internet, I'd be surprised if we ever reach 4000. But it is wonderful to see 20 of us here
Funny men men back back men back back back men men men ... men
As a Florida man I disapprove of people thinking everything revolves around the USA
I just click ‘like’ while the advert is on in case I forget later… always brilliant
When it takes you 11 minutes and 13 seconds to just say one name in 3 seconds. :)
As much as you guys are the only ones whose Ad Breaks I enjoy and not skip, it is a shame to see you take on such a scam company as advertiser
hi both, love the video but it's worth researching Better Help a bit more - they are notoriously sketchy, not only are they dodgy about whether therapists are vetted or not but also they have sold incredibly personal consumer data (lots of articles online about this recently because they were found guilty). There are also some great video essays about BH and how they aren't quite what they seem. just letting you know if it informs future decisions.
I love that you actually registered the domain. 😂
The companies hiring you for ads don't know what talent they get for their buck. I can not find a therapist and have given up on searching years ago. Your ad makes me honestly considering trying better help. I was not expecting this and I'll probably even try it out. And all that only because I love your work for your outstanding integrity and 'couse I respect Ray as a seriously professional fellow musician (in the good way).
"now that they arent limited to 3 letters they can be anything Like 'cat'"
Horray
Bro this is hands down the best history/geography/comedy channel on youtube
Before watching, I'm guessing .tk  After watching: yea
Can you release a full version of the song at the end please?
IP address?? they know where I pee???
I haven't watched it yet but I'm guessing it'll be Tuvalu
two-letters.
5:41 Jon Postel actually created IANA, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which he administered until his death.  IANA was subsumed under ICANN only shortly before Postel’s death.
I can fully believe this as my first band website back in 2005 was a .tk and I've never heard of the place
As an NI resident, absolutely love the "ats us nai" thrown in there
Better help sell personal information....  Should a company that is involved with a service that is GUARENTEED PERSONAL SECRECY, be selling personally identifiable information?   Just dont connect through their servers.... use a 3rd party video chat software that you trust to converse with your better help therapist.  I wouldnt trust better help tbw
The subliminal message in the “paid partnership!” has been well understood
I didn't have the attention span to watch the whole thing, can I have a TLD TLDR?
I'm going in assuming it's .tk which stands for the tiny island of Tokelau!  Edit: yup!
Important question: where can I get that Mr Spoon bumper sticker??
about the potential utility of country codes: as a portuguese from portugal, sometimes it's really useful for my research to only use ".pt" websites rather than ".br" ones (information varies according to the place or language) rather than having to search for the slight differences between written brazilian and iberian portuguese, i can just sort out the country codes! i imagine the same applies (and might be even more useful due to the high number of countries) for spanish speakers!
Please don't take betterhelp sponsorships any more :/
highlight of the year
what do you mean, i've never heard of it?! i've known about this for over 20 years and even owned a couple of tk domains back when i built my own html hobby projects
Oh my goodness! It’s a birthday present from the Map Men! I couldn’t be more thrilled!
being american, this rly confused me until like halfway through when it explained how we just ignore this🤣
I am on the internet and I can confirm that this is 100% accurate.
Babe wake up new map men
Yes, this was all a joke
Tuvalu?
Betterhelp is not a good choice of sponsor. They are extremely unethical and not a good choice for people seeking therapy, either. This is very disappointing.
it has to be .tv
Boom
Great work, will you ever cover map of space? Or moon, or mars, that be intresting!
The credit music really got me 😂
I thought you’d explain a bit more about .cat, as it’s famously used by Nyan Cat, and it’s from Catalonia, a region in Spain that wants to become independent.
10:35 Worth noting that .cat was created to promote the Catalan language and culture, not really for general cat websites. There are other comments that also point this out but I left a comment anyways
> You'll never guess the most popular internet country code  Ha, I did. Maybe working at a registrar has some perks.
So glad map men ls back😊😊. Loved this episode about the internet. Please more map men.
nice video
Your BBQ is clearly just stolen footage from Sorted of Barry and Jamie lol
what a complete and utter mess this ccTLD is, thank you for the awesome video!
You were right, I wouldn’t’ve guessed
I love Map Men! Please make more!
My guess based on info, Montenegro with "ME"
6:18 Putin was not a fan of the USSR? where do people get this from?? He was our guy.
I haven't see the video yet. Is it Tuvalu?
My guess is, Transylvania. I shall return to watch this to find out how wrong I was.
greta video, as always! :D
Didn't expect Portugal to have so many. I wonder why
Ooooh, I thought it was .tv, I completely forgot about .tk! I remember when those were everywhere because it was the only free one. I think I used to have one as well.
Fun fact, .ml is Mali and because it is similar to .mil for US military use, thousands of emails were accidentally sent to Mali instead because of typos. What makes it worse is that .ml were also free to register like .tk, so you could domain-squat them.
You fools i already knew it was a disproportionate amount or their national income just for the fees
gg => GameGear Thanks for that nostalgia to the greatest handheld console ever made ❤
❤
Its time to watch every map men video again
Hahahaha. I visited those urls 😂😂😂 that's rather funny guys 😊
These guys are the only YouTube channel I won't skip the sponsor ad. As usual top notch video !
The East German dd was indeed used in the last days of the GDR, but it was isolated by universities of Jena and Dresden....
I'm from New Zealand and I didn't know that island existed until just now.
i bet it’s tuvalu
The niche category of foreign lolz
Did I try the website at 5:43 yes, was I disappointed? Well my disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined. So yeah ;(
I will not be watching the rest of this video, or any more of your videos until you end your partnership with Betterhelp. They are an extremely predatory organization. Do better.
google.co.ck
The ad break warning in the top right was a lovely throwback
Best advertisement ever
.cat isn't a "nonsensical" TLD, it is used by websites in Catalan, and it is used very similarly to regular countries TLD
Oh no, they mentioned .cat.... The Catalonians will be complaining soon
Brilliant brilliant brilliant! I was critical about your last video being to mainstream. But this is fast paced, quirky, witty and novel. Thank you for this wonderful effort.
I didn't expect to see an Evil Edna reference in 2023, but I am very pleasantly surprised at her presence!
Before I watch is it .tv
9:52 maybe i'm a weirdo but i pronounce microsofts current products with the emm ess prefix as well. ms teams? ms exchange? calling these services like that helps better communicate the spite i have for them
You didn't mention domains which use non-latin scripts.
Fun fact: the .cf, .gq, .ml and .ga are also free domains, like .tk. Given away by the same company/person. That's why they are so big.
Oh man, I made so many crappy websites with my free .tk domains back in the day.
Guys YouTube collectively realized BetterHelp is a dystopian unethical nightmare in TWENTY-EIGHTEEN!! Did you not even look at their Wikipedia!:  ""Controversies In October 2018, BetterHelp gained attention from media personalities after concerns were raised about alleged use of unfair pricing, bad experiences with the app, paid reviews from actors, and terms of service that allegedly did not correspond with ads promoted by professional YouTubers. CEO Alon Matas issued a statement responding to the allegations. YouTube content creators such as PewDiePie and Boogie2988 have spoken out on this issue.[8][better source needed] BetterHelp has received backlash for supposedly sharing its customers' personal data with Facebook. In its latest privacy policy update, BetterHelp stated: "We may share your information in connection with an asset sale, merger, bankruptcy, or other business transaction." The company has responded to these complaints by saying that law requires BetterHelp to hold on to health data and that they are not subject to HIPAA guidelines.  On March 2, 2023, the FTC issued a proposed order banning BetterHelp from sharing consumers' health data with third parties. The order also requires BetterHelp to pay $7.8 million to consumers to settle allegations of revealing consumers' sensitive data with Facebook, Snapchat, and others. The FTC complaint tied to the proposed order alleges that BetterHelp collected health status and histories, IP addresses, and email addresses from consumers while making repeated promises to keep this information private. "From 2013 to December 2020, however, [BetterHelp] continually broke these privacy promises, monetizing consumers’ health information to target them and others with advertisements for the Service," the complaint summarizes.""  I'm sorry but I can't stay subscribed to creators that don't vet their sponsors for gross ethical violations.
I actually did guess it was Tokelau, remember making a .tk website as a kid
Aw yeah Tuvalu! I knew that one. Of the new non country ones, I like .moe, since it is used for weeb purposes.
2:37 As a kiwi, I appreciate and approve this joke
bro wake up Jay Foreman just posted
I thought CV was a European thing. As an American all my life I grew up calling it a resume (no accent marks as those are punishable by a fine and laughing).
I'm really glad .su still exists. I see it used pretty often by various tradesmen (they write it on the side of their work vans), and it's a great reminder of the alternative reality that once existed before 1991, before the country was robbed and fooled and torn apart and plunged into poverty and endless civil wars by nationalists, moneyed interests, bandits and the West.
I'll guess Tuvalu.
I love you guys <3
9:50 I just wish Czechia got .ok just like we have for aircraft registrations. 😅
Tuvalu
My guess was .tv so I'm glad it got a mention! Love the video 😊
Some of the places you mentioned here not to be countries are most definitely countries... and vice-versa
Lot of adds... They most really need the money!
I see Map Men have not yet upgraded to IPv6 - shameful
Isn’t The UK several countries?
I’m going to guess the Cook Islands code.
Hi
My guess is Tuvalu
Can we get an american Map Men for that map at 7:30 ?
"The internet will come at you like wasps." Thanks, I´ll add that to my list of recurring nightmares
I like the way you those ads!
increbdible
Love the video! You didn't mention IDNs, Internationalized domain names, which use non-ASCII characters such as .рф for Russia. It hasn't really taken off that much so maybe you just chose not to mention it.  BTW please don't accept sponsorship from BetterHelp again, it's shady and awful
Such a missed chance to nickname him Postle the Apostle instead of God of the Internet.
let me guess. Tuvalu?
Betterhelp is a scam btw
RIP, the recently dead cat.
as a torquay resident, this is the most my town has been mentioned since agatha christie 😭
The website at 5:42 is an actual website lol
Jay's ads are the only ones I don't skip. You two are hilarious! ✌
Irritating presentation 🙄
Brilliant! As always. Thank you jay.foreman and mark.cooper.jones 🙂
On your internet map some countries were represented as larger than their geographic size while others were smaller. Was there a country that was exactly even?
I am going to guess Tuvalu for .tv
wait, I can't use or embed  a funny jingle in my comment, but I have to say :  "better help" is not real therapy and will share your personal information and problems cause they are not real doctors and also don't pay their employees properly~  I understand, "content creators got to eat"  but "Better help" is hot garbage and I just wanted to warn the viewers , I am sure others have done already as well
My guess .tv
Two chaps from the country which does not put its name on the postage stamps it issues (because it invented the stamp) kvetch about the country which invented the Internet and does not put its name on its TLD/Domain names.
.Cat it's for catalonia in Spain not for cat the animal, we have some regional names like .eus or .gal not only .es for the country
3:12 this will be stuck in my head for a while
This video series rules!
I do feel it's a bit lacking to just say "it makes sense .nl has so many users because the Netherlands is a rich and dense country."   Even for a rich and dense country, the fact that its over 6 million domain names is insane. The .nl domain has over 1 (active) domain name for every 3 people living in the Netherlands. It's heavily disproportionate even between the other two countries named in that line, the UK and Germany.
Goated
Haven’t seen the video but it’s Tuvalu right?
2:02 4 thousand people?! Man, that's insane 🤯
I-S-O THREE ONE SIX SIX HY-PHEN ONE
I absolutely love your map of the US's perception on the rest of the world. As an American I can conclude it is very accurate with exception to just one very minor detail. If you can, pls change "Dunno" to "middle east/ Africa". Thanks.
Missed the map men. Bless the internet!
The wallahwallah bing bang and chicken squawk were a nice touch, guys, well played
So! something interesting to why cctld is useful to me. I live in the french speaking part of belgium. Whenever I have to google some administrative questions, or find a website that specifically needs to be belgian (for example, real estate agencies), google doesn't always care that I specifically typed "belgium" in the search bar. Screening through the tld's, I can directly see if the website is based in france or belgium
Well done on pronouncing St Helena correctly!
I couldn't see .io on the map. Maybe it's not as popular as I thought?
I'd guess it's .be because of YT.
"You've never heard of Tokelau" - as if I didn't catch your dig at the flag referendum...
Pre-watch prediction: Tuvalu
I'm in New Zealand,  Tokelau is very remote and has only 1,500 people  It was under COVID lockdown for 3 years. The only way to get there is on a 24-hour boat trip from Samoa to the closest atoll of Fakaofo, after a four-hour flight from New Zealand to Apia. It takes a further 3½ hour boat trip to Nukunonu and a further six hours to the furthest atoll, Atafu.
is it .tv for Tuvalu?
9:49
Map Men bring me so much joy! 💁🏻‍♂️🗺🧏🏻‍♂️
Chuffed to see the map men again :)
its funny even if i expect it to be
Thanks for calling out US defaultism! My heroes ❤
I thought it was tuvulu :(
2 next videos ideas: why antiviruses are now useless, what betterhelp does with your data,....
Dot cat is not just for felines, or so I was told. It is for us, the catalans and our things. Also for catalan cats, or "mixos".
In Sweden .nu  (the island of Nauru if I am not mistaken) is quite popular, as "nu" = "now" in Swedish.
Was a Cook Islands joke too low hanging?
Well, not finishing this episode after you shilled BetterHelp, and putting serious thought into whether I'm going to watch any in future.
noo not the betterhelp sponsorship 😭😭😭
in Poland putting your country's code PL in your nick was and is very popular.
Another great video.  Just waiting for @JJLAReacts for a reaction video now.  He loves you guys as much as I do I think 😂❤
Exit theme is beautiful, simply beautiful. It touches me in ways I never want to be touched ever again.
Your outtro music is very appropriate.
Ha haa. As a kiwi, I knew about Tokelau.
I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that the .nu domain (Niue) is managed by Sweden, and has been for some time. Essentially Sweden has both .se and .nu, and Niue has none
These are my most man that map. Like!
All of those TLDs to choose from, and still Google felt .zip and .mov were necessary additions.
I think it was Neil Degrasse Tyson who made this point but: Since America INVENTED the underlying systems for The Internet in the first place, they were considered the default for internet addresses. Britain has the same attitude regarding international postage: When international postage doesn't specify which country it is supposed to go to: it goes to The UK, because Britain invented the concept of postal mail, so it is the default country regarding postage.
5:28 - Was that an AI generated Mark??
I need a full version of the credits song!
Kaw
So i am indian and i was older than i care to admit before knowing this concept. As a smol child i thought .in means the act of going INside the web. But then i reason myself out of thay idea with a better explaination:  .in must stand for .internet
Interesting sponsor...
Did you just find a way of making cocktails tax deductible?
One of your best!
Wow, how could you resist losing a minute following the tangent that .ch is not China's... but in fact:    Swtizerland!
I wonder if my free .TK website is still up..
catchy outro music, not sure if it's new or this is the 1st time I've ever made it to the end?
I'm going to guess. Tuvalu?
I guessed, but then I do work for a company that sells domain names. 😅
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmn betterhelp. totally acceptable sponsor without any issues worth looking into...
Keep these coming ❤❤❤ best YouTube channel .ever
10:38 is a good joke.
my internet connection went to hell around 8:13 & i thought it was a bit in the episode
.cat is actually used as a country domain for Catalonia!
I guessed it... .tk.
7:42 i live near torquay
Glad to hear .pizza get a shoutout! I use that one myself for my (wholly non-pizza-related) business.
worst best outrow ever
One of Jay's classic out of tune / time songs at the end too. This time the treatment was given to London Bridge Is Falling Down.
Blast from the past.  I used to make cartoons of my teachers on Macromedia, upload them to geocities and then get a better url from tk.
"neither have you".... yes i have... like 15 or so years ago, when you could get a free .tk domain and there was a crap ton of advertising for it
A few years ago I had two .tk domains.
0:01  Haven’t watch but I’d guess .TV
That reminds me.  I'm all out of Beef Butter.
This is a bit spin on a practice with precedent where the country which invents and controls a system considers itself to be the "default."  This is actually also true of postal (UK) and phone (US) systems, although in the phone system due to technical reasons you still use country code +1 for the US and Canada.  But +1 sure sounds like the "default" to me.  Also keep in mind that the rules on .us domains were/are considered rather ... privacy unfriendly.  .us is considered to be used for us persons (or entities now?) and was not allowed to have "hidden" registration values.  In recent years at least, I see some kind of privacy hiding on .us domains all the time now, so I don't know if they've just decided not to enforce it or what.  Why should we use country codes?  Because it's about governance of who gets what domains, and a country should have the ability to create and manage domain names.
Guessing: .nu certainly is popular in Sweden. Basically 'cause it means "now" in swedish.
I believe the .cat domain is restricted for use related to Catalan.
As a fan of the TV show Nathan Barley, I was really hoping the .co .ck from the Cook Islands would be the winner. Great video as always.
New map men video, time to drop everything I’m doing
10:37 In order to get a .cat TLD, your website needs to promote Catalan culture, which isn't hard, but I don't speak Catalan. It makes me sad because I like cats :c
Yay map men
Impressive CV guys!!
Fun fact: When Montenegro gained independence from Serbia and Montenegro (formerly named Yugoslavia) their domain name changed from .yu to .me
love the small addition of the black rotating rectangle that's always played before an ad on tv, its  really  cool
Why does that MEGATRONICS DCX-450 (Mark II) have a waffle maker connected to it 😂😂
The outro song is the greatest outro song ever written. I burst out laughing! Studios, take notice!
“The United States of America considers itself the Default country” Truer words have not been spoken
can we make the iso 3166-1 a tone for messsges please.. it's actually catchy.
before watching: i'm guessing it's .tv or maybe .co
3:11 ISO 3166-1
I'm gonna guess .co, since I'm colombian and I think corporations like .co
Tuvalu {.tv?)
. SU, we coming back baby!
Since I have 100% completed the "220+ countries and territories" map game, I do know where tokelau is.
I miss my SCSI waffle maker from the early days of the internet
I live in Torquay!! 🤣🤣
Is it .cx? 0:10
I loved the progressively more broken outro song
Ok, so guessing before the video starts that it's either to (Tobago, I think) or tv (Tuvalu?). If it's not those, maybe China which I think is zh (I can't remember)?
And now there is a whole bunch of people that will remember the specific ISO code for countries.
as a geogussr player i see these everyday
I have an opportunity for Mr. LeSquids, can you please make sure my letter comes to himself ?
I was fully expecting a callback to "It was the beginning of the Internet!", even though they explicitly stated at the beginning that they would not repeat themselves. Oh well.
Ironic how much you bring up scams but have betterhelp as a sponsor... betterhelp is a scam, they sell private medical information to third parties and use targeted advertising to advertise to vulnerable people. they don't vet their "therapists" and overwork and underpay the ones they hire.  Oh and they're under investigation by the FCC if all of that wasn't enough.  This company is reprehensible and a complete and utter scam. Please don't fall for this.
The island state of Niue (pop 1600) had a country code popular in Sweden (.nu) since "nu" means "now" in Swedish. 9:52 There it is
I saw that Witch Doctor reference! Don't think you can hide behind fast moving graphics!
Omg i love all the nonsense tlds at the end.
I think it's interesting to mention that some "countries" using an alphabet other than the Latin get a bonus ccTLD in their local alphabet. For example, in Greece, there are .gr and .ελ (although almost nobody uses .ελ, because it was recently added and people are used to .gr). Also, in the EU there are .ευ and .ею (the greek and cyrillic equivalents to .eu), beacuse official languages of the Union use these alphabets.
for those wondering, the first website in the intro is a real website and has a link to this video, but the others are currently unclaimed
I for one am excited to get more lore about Toby Le Squids. GO MUM!
So, Youtube froze for a second during the "map men, map men, map map map men men" part, and I genuinely thought it was an intentional part of the video. It wasn't until I went back and rewatched it that I realised.
Yay new map men episode!!!!
I've dreamt of getting my hands on a .co.ck for years
As an American, I can say that the statement of, "The USA, which often considers itself the world's default country" is about as accurate statement as you can make. For comparison, the statement "water is wet" would be more controversial.
awwww, no sponsor?
As a Belgian I am proud we have more country codes than the USA
as a NZer I chuckled at 2:37
I rewound the advert it’s that good
BetterHelp are great at selling your personal data!
This is amazing.
If Monaco would sell .mc domains to non-Monacan entities they'd make a lot of money from Minecraft
Damn it Map Men, stop making me learn in fun and interesting ways. I'm American I like to wallow in ignorance.
Its tuvalu, isn't it? Dot TV
I worry that the final joke (about the Internet buzzing at humans like flies in real life) will be imbued by Apollo with the gift of prophecy in our lifetime 💀
Love it!
What about Argentina?
So many jokes, yet I fail to laugh... I dont get it? Is this British Humour???
coolvideo.mapmen
Tv is my guess
To be fair to us Americans, the designated commercial TLD being our de-facto default domain is exactly the sorta cyberpunk nonsense to be expected of the US.
Brilliant. This is precisely what we need, a fresh new Jay Foreman/Map Men video.
The US standardly using the "commercial" code is incredibly fitting
"NEITHER HAVE YOU"!? Man my first website was on a .tk domain. >:(
My friend hosts his Minecraft server with .gay
you two are the gods of Easter eggs, I KNEW that URL would led me to something
I appreciated the mallet's mallet sound effect :)
The song at the end was great...
You’re welcome for the internet guys 😊
Tuvalu?
Jon Postel cannot get enough praise. He made the internet waist narrow.
Really thought this was going to be a video about the Cook Islands...
Wait I gotta come back?
You both are hansome men But i think three-names is a bit cutier
I love how the Betterhelp ad looked like a Sunlife ad!
Ah, the winning combo of maps and men. Nice.
I had a .tk domain back in the day for my Angelfire site
The US made it so we play by their rules…seems fair to me 🤷🏼‍♂️
3:31 thank Jon for creating sh islands
i think honestly, adverts ARE the wasps of the internet world
.cat is actually a domain for the region of Catalonia in Spain.
my guess is it’s going to be tuvalu
BetterHelp is a scam that does the opposite of help people. Please don't promote them.
MenInMaps
Gotta love Google adding the .zip tld because that's not confusing or anything...
The US invented the system so they made themselves the default. Amusingly the same thing happened with phones. The US invented the system so they took the default country code of (1)
6:58 why is Ascension island south of St. Helena? Do they consider it to be a part of Africa and St. Helena a part of Europe?
I miss the days of making waffles while I waited 20 minutes for my BMP to load.
Ah, now I have heard of Tokelau. I had a domain name with them because it was free, right up until the point I discovered Cloudflare wouldn’t use them for dynamic DNS. Luckily, I was able to bag a proper domain name for a couple of quid a year, by bagging one for ten years. And then I got a static IP address, rendering the whole reason for changing a bit moot. Or at least it was, as Freenom stopped doing tk domains altogether, so I’d have had to do it anyway
You didnt go over the Christmas Island top level domain's main claim to fame.
5:42 someone actually claimed that url, that was quick
This is by far my favourite series on the internet! Love from Tokelau xx
I've always wondered why some websites have strangely apt domains like Twitch. I never considered that they were bought from real places. Thank you, Map Men, for making my brain .0001% bigger
the outro :(
It has been brought to my attention that what I said is very much outdated info that is no longer true. To whoever might read this: please disregard this comment.     Original comment for context:  I always thought it was really annoying that here in Argentina the rules don't allow us to register ".ar" domains, instead only ".com.ar" and ".net.ar" being available, because "-ar" is the most common ending for verbs in infinitive form in Spanish so it would be a goldmine of word play.
Can confirm, we Muricans invented the internet so _obviously_ we should be the "default" country code 🙃 Also fun fact: .gov and .mil are _extremely_ regulated TLDs, and for a damn good reason. Literally anyone can make a .net or .com or whatever, but there is so, SO much paperwork involved in .gov to ensure the applicant is legit and, y'know, actually authorized by The Government to register the site. Even actual government agencies use this for partitioning, the public-facing side of the United States Postal Service is a .com, while the internal stuff meant for employee use only is a .gov. So if you're on a website that's supposed to be super secure and governmenty, and it _doesn't_ end in .gov... might be sus.
while youtube is at war with ad blockers here are Map Men to show every content creator how you can incorporate ads, and not only make it watchable, but an actively enjoyable part of a video.
don't do sponsor deals with BetterHelp thanks, they're a fucking awful company that sells sham therapy to vulnerable people plus a myriad other reasons. disappointed in you for this one.
The mad lads did it.  https://hereliesjonpostelsuchalovelyandclevermanmissedbymany1943-1998.com/rest/in/peace/
At 9:45, anyone else go to  . 25 speed so you can read all the examples. Including the resume.... GO MUM! 😂😂😂
The fact that no domain company sponsored this video is shoking
another fun fact is that originally the ".gov" and ".mil" were meant for any government or military. but, since the US was/is the one in charge of the internet, it has only ever handed out either to its own agencies.
Great explanation
I remember when the .tk domain names came out. It was some random island somewhere selling off domain names with that TK at the end so they'd look like proper website addresses and not just some big long geocities series of numbers and letters or whatever. Either they were selling them extremely cheaply, or they were free, I can't remember exactly. But everyone on the Internet went a little bit mad buying up all the .tk addresses.   But these days your actual website address is pointless. Nobody searches for things by writing a phrase and adding a .com on the end anymore. Everyone just uses the address bar as the Google search engine and finds what they want that way and it's just much easier for all involved. Back in the day people used to buy domain names and just sit on them, waiting for some big company to want that domain name, and so they could then sell it to the company for an extortionate cost.    But these days nobody does that because nobody finds websites that way. It's all purely just googling a phrase or a company and finding their website by clicking on it in the results page. So a lot of those people squatting on domain names got screwed in the end lol
Back in the days of Geocities I had a .tk domain
Back from dead mother buckers
Im guessing tuvalu for most popular country code, lets find out if I was correct
I'm just astonished that Toby Le Squids counted every cod sandwich he's ever made and eaten. Now that's dedication.
I didn't see the .su for soviet union on the map? Is it just too small to see as it has a couple sites on it lol
10:40 The "1500 current TLDs" is laughably stupid.  It's like a preschooler was put in charge.
heyyyyyy fishhoieeeee
Before watching, my guess is Tuvalu’s
That outro music is top notch !!
7:47 - not true, I heard of Tokelau way back in early 2000. Selling domain rights to .tk was a big chunk of Tokelau's economy. Similarly .tv (Tuvalu) and .fm (Micronesia) are very popular due to obvious connection to TV and FM radio respectively
that youtubers still take betterhelp sponsorships after everything that happened is a damn shame
Haven't watched yet, it's probably Tuvalu
Dot TV?
Jon Postel, RIP
the right honorable the lords spiritual and temporal of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland .gov .uk
I'm getting the vague impression there's a paid partnership somewhere in this video, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe I need some help. And if me and the help can't figure it out I'll get some... Better Help 🥁🛎
As always, great video☕
interesting how much the dominance of english as a global language explains most all of this.
So, dear viewer, what percentage of *your* MM viewing time is spent rewinding 10 seconds in order to try and catch all the jokes? 25%? 50%? 99%?   p.s. love the outro music, hope this one becomes permanent!
Christmas comes early with the Map Men!
I thought it was gonna be .be for Youtube... 7:43 still waiting for you to mention that...
dot cat is for the catalan language, not for cats not surprised you don't take research seriously anyway, this video is wrong in so many ways
3:12 🎶 iso 3166-1 🎶
Better Help should NOT be your sponsor. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx07d2FpZT4
Rip .tk  Had so many hobby and school project websites on .tk urls all through my teens.
There is an important fact you should have mentioned here at 09:30 As you said earlier, there are no rules for country based TLDs. Which is why they accidentally sold their tld years ago to a foreign company for a very low price without knowing what they are doing. This company now receives these millions. 🇹🇻 doesn’t see anything from that money.
Ironically, this was my laggiest viewing of a mapman video
You mention (briefly) BRAZIL, so I must represent it: HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE BR
Trashbat
.fo does not stand for Faroe. it stands for Faroe Islands, or sheep island islands. Faroe is a different place, in the baltic sea. fyi
Love the Sega Game Gear
Great video as always  I was this years old when I learned that the Tokelau flag was very similar to the Bosnia-Herzegovina flag.
0:37 Brits using a chonky IBM clone to represent old computers instead of a ZX Spectrum, Sinclair, Amstrad, BBC Micro or Amiga? Don't think I didn't catch that treachery.
Good Stuff.
Funny as always guys...
For your information ,  the map shown in video is wrong because the disputed area between India and pakistan is shown within pakistan , it should be shown differently .
I saw that. For .ai you put Marvin the Paranoid Android in as an image. One of my favourite music artists.
Before I watch I'm gonna go ahead and guess the federated states of Micronesia
NZ MENTIONED! <3
jay i love you
.cat is from Catalonia, not the felines 😂
.tv
Would have to say without watching that its whatever country code is 69. lol
Okay, the waffle maker got me.  I laff'd.
Where can I buy that outro music?
Oh, Jon Postel aka IANA...
I'm calling it from the title. This is about Tuvalu
Map Men - education by humour! I've watched them all... I've even watched some multiple times  Even funnier after a few drinks
But I actually HAVE heard of Tokelau. I had a .tk at some point, back when it was only mildly dodgy, and not terribly dodgy.
Amazing video, love how you took the original format and adapted it in order to cover modern topics and history 😊  Really don't like you supporting an app that basically makes money off people's bad mental health though. I know that they pay *a lot* to creators, but I genuinely think you're better than that. Just do your own research, giving you the benefit of the doubt of course. 🙂
5:38 *Internet* Corporation, actually, not International.
seems to me that is missing a very big southamerican country at 0:10, may be? it seem literally flown 🤣🤣
I can't believe I've just seen an "Ats us nai" on Map Men  Feeling quite represented now. Sorry, nai
As an American Ill say that .us has the same feel as .su  scammy
I LOVE MAP MEN
The Jon Postel link is valid, that is fantastic Easter egg
I love all those 6 .nz flags 2:37.
One of the few, if not the only channel, I watch the full ads on.
Please don’t support better help which has no real data protection and actively hurt people.
Before I watch, I’m pretty sure you’re talking about Tuvalu and .TV
for anyone curious the link on the grave stone works
Montenegro
Petition for a map men blooper and deleted scenes vid
Am I a nerd for knowing that the computer screen at 1:19 is actually from an Amstrad CPC computer?
let me guess... Tuvalu
The world's default country lol
Way too stupid.
What I took away from this video THERES A DOT UNICORN 😂😂😂
So funny Thanks 😂
woo hoo new map men
You still remain the only people in the world whose ads I like to watch.
It's all the fault of Geoguessr players
Before watching the video I am commenting my guess of Tuvalu, with the .tv domain
Is it Tuvalu?
The clickbaity title made me scroll past, and it wasn't till a second look made me realise this was a Map Men video. I'm glad I came back!
Best channel on YouTube
I should mention that in the US, Curriculum Vitae is a collected list of all of your prior work, whereas a resume can usually mean a "best of" or "most relevant" when applying to a job. CV's are largely used in academia, though there are some other places that require one over a resume. Also, Cape Verdean food is underrated.
9:35  Is the adverb "well, why?"
This channel is so funny
4:33 hey! wanted to mention betterhelp doesnt have the greatest track record for being good at, surprisingly, help. really uncomfortable with you taking sponsorships from them, would be great if you can look into them to maybe reconsider a sponsorship from them in the future! either way, great video!
1:10 I find myself unduly annoyed that the geek is typing into a random (modern, wireless!) PC keyboard, but his code is appearing as a static screenshot of an Amstrad CPC!  How am I meant to believe anything you say!?!?!?   No, you're a nerd.
I just want to say that I never skip any of these advertisements, unlike I do with almost every other single youtuber.
If you have too much free time like me, typing out the web name on the tombstone goes to an actual website.
Country codes make sense. They help avoid duplicate site/business names between countries. They also help you locate the sites relevant to your own country when searching.
This is the best youtube channel. The only channel where I don't skip the ads for fear of missing a joke. Loved the music at the end.
This video fails to explain why .is (Islamic State) is so popular with Icelanders.
Ats us nai!
Love the outro 😂😂
Ats us nai!
Map men are back with smith specail
My guess before watching: It may be .tk because it's free.  Edit: Since now I've watched the video and I was able to guess it before watching the video, I demand a change in the video title.
I don't know how to tell you guys this but we are the world's default country
I actually work with country codes every day at my job. I love them deeply. Big up to AD (Andorra) for being at the top of the list and the top of my heart.
The credits theme is great, loved it. Made me watch to the end of the credits :D
It's definitely Tuvalu because it's .tv
mark american accent jumpscare
great map, men
.tk used to have a registration office in London.
Correction: Since Brexit the GB strickers are needed when driving abroad.
Uh, you were missing a flag there, wheres lazer kiwi?
They are easily some of the most under rated guys on the interweb.mapmen
I’m so happy that Northern Ireland got represented with “you what” and “ats us nai”
... why would you do that? i really want to check that URL...  edit:..... how much did that cost you two....  another edit: no its not the full URL I'm lazy but thanks for the laugh. my neighbours probably heard that one.  yet another edit: I am a massive nerd but hidden URLs are so tempting...
For those who didn't get it, "If you don't know me by now" is a song by Mick Hucknall.
I was waiting for the globes to fall down again but it didn't happen (deep sigh)
Meh poor map men, .cat is actually Catalonia in Spain and is highly regulated for use
WAKE UP PEOPLE THE MAP MEN POSTED 🗣️ 🗣️ 🗣️ 🔥
Guys,      I love your videos, but this one has a very heavy advertisement overhead!  To start, there are two 15 second ads which can't be skipped.  Then your self-produced advertisement in the middle, then a third "can't skip" advertisement then one which can be skipped.  I realize most of this could be out of your control.  But for some reason the ad overhead for your material is getting out of hand.
Nice episode
I don't know, I think the "Paid Partnership" disclaimer was a little too subtle
Don’t even have to watch. It’s Tuvalu, right? .tv so lots of tv shows want it, I’m guessing.
.bunghole at the end of the list. Cheeky!
2:37 No laser kiwi?
I feel like it's becoming required for all comedy legends to make passing reference to Torquay at some point in their career... Great video lads!
Hey the globes stayed on the wall this time!
Didn't Moonshine Sally come from Tokelau Valley?
Ok, really cool map, BUT WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH PORTUGAL????
Hi Jay! Hi Mark!  The London Bridges that are my eardrums are certainly falling down after that lovely rendition.
tuvalu
woowwwww that outro music made me PHYSICALLY uncomfortable 🤣🤣🤣
yah nz flags. Forgot laser Kiwi
I think the funniest ccTLD is .tf, which is supposed to represent French Southern and Antarctic Lands, but only ever gets used for Team Fortress 2 fansites.
It’s Tuvalu.
I was expecting ".tv" because I'd heard that story before.
jay urgghhh ima busss
I'm never forgetting the name ISO 3166-1 ever again
The new Zealand flags gag was 9/10 because there was no lazer Kiwi included
Uh can I get a TLDr?
imagine saying Domain Name System system /s
I hope you guys can find a better sponsor. Engaging and informative episode as always
What do I get if I guess correctly?
.
6:09 I'm afraid Poland was also part of SU, gaining it's own ccTLD (and independence) in 1990. So little mistake, just a small one.
I was about to criticize and make fun of the clickbait “You’ll never… whatever” title. But, hey, the video is actually pretty good.👍
the amount of subtle jokes in this video proves british humor is elite
Tuvalu
Deservedly watched. The attention to detail makes it special. Thanks!
the .tv thing was new to me and quite cool as I have never thought about it before
i can't believe you didn't mention the cook islands' ccTLD which is .ck
ISO 3166-1! 🎶
Omg…. Websites coming at you like wasps…. That really is hellish!  Count me out!  My money was on Tuvalu from the start.   Love i5 when I’m wrong and learn something!
I think you guys missed the ".co.uk" ... I demand an explanation! 😡
Trust USA to act like it is running the whole internet!
https://www.hereliesjonpostelsuchalovelyandclevermanmissedbymany1943-1998.com/rest/in/peace
disappointed in the betterhelp sponsorship. do at least some minimal research before sponsors
Zuurbier is a pretty decent name for a bit of a c**t. Literally means 'Sour beer', and being sour in Dutch means something akin to being bitter in English, which I'm sure we all are when it comes to spam.
Uk
By far favouratest channel ever. Thanks!!!
Before watching: it's Tuvalu because of the .tv domain
One funny thing I learned a few years ago, the French Antarctic Territories have their own domain (.tf) but it's mostly used for websites centred around the video game Team Fortress 2. I'd never really thought there'd be an actual part of the world that was meant to be using it.
heads up, betterhelp has been caught failing to thoroughly vet their therapists, and also selling patient data to media corporations such as facebook. Do your research before signing up to them.
TUVALU
At the end .cat is mentioned. It is reserved only for internet sites in Catalan language, not for sites about cats.
2:37 Nice one, cheers from New Zealand.
Another great video
does the avarage tuvaluan get like 900 USD a year because .tv makes like 10.000.000?
Shout out to Guernsey’s .gg
I guessed it! I used to have a tk domain as a kid when it was a hype.
Love the ending theme tune.
Honestly surprised .tks are still so popular like they were in like 2006. I had myself a few at the time.
Not USA = niche category. LOL
.cat is actually not just a silly TLD for kitty enjoyers, it's also used as an unofficial ccTLD by people in Catalonia!
I’m guessing Tuvalu?
Fun thing. That Cat TLD is actually a pretty old one, serving the linguistic and cultural community of Catalan speakers. So. Not even a country or an island, but a community.
We have a .paris and I don't know what to do with this information.
9:00 lol
The '.cat' domain is used for the catalan language.
As beautiful as ever! Jay's not bad either.
Without watching, my guess would be .io? EDIT: lol, not even close
Love you guys! Thanks!
back men
If I had to guess it's Indonesia or tuvalu because of .io and .tv
I will say without see the video... Ireland . ie
The .gov and .mil TLD's are restricted for use by the U.S. government, and each of the states. The Internet was created by the U.S. military, after all. (D)ARPA, to be exact.
The waffle iron peripheral made me laugh so hard I had to rewind. 😂🎉
Fake looking AI generated wasps yes.
Genuine guess before I watch the video: Is it Tuvalu? (.tv)
Jon Postel really was all that. Glad you emphasized his contributions.
'Tis .tv. Wait nooo!
at us nai
Will you bring back the unfinished Unfinished London series too?
Beef butter sounds terrific . . . though I wonder if that was what was used on those cod sandwiches . . . .
Frankly the Internet is already coming at us like wasps...
I am now going to be singing "I-S-O, three-one-six-six, hy-phen-one!" all day now. Thanks a bunch Map Men
Before watching the video I guess Tuvalu
bit late to be considered the end of november but i'll let that slide
Isn't .cat for Catalonia?
At least one person around these comments basked the cosy warmth of the Amstrad CPC Locomotive BASIC screen 😊
At 2:29: the country code doesn't "sometime come after another TLD". The TLD - Top Level Domain, is always at the top level. If something comes after it, then it's not a TLD. For "co.uk", "uk" is the TLD, and "co" is just a subdomain, not another TLD.
Is it .tv?
I guessed .tv
i like this
Hate from .tv
Sweden has bought a lot of Niues domains. Since .nu means now in Swedish it made telling people the website adress sound more direct and urgent.
Tuvalu
Love it 😂👍☝🏾👳🏾‍♂️
Fab.
haven't watched the vid yet, but I'm betting it's Tuvalu since they have .tv
Soon there would be a superTLD
Didn't betterhelp get in trouble for giving out its users' data? Outing closeted people to their families and stuff like that? Terrible sponsor.
I remember getting a .tk website back in school in the early '00s, as our IT teacher commented we could all make a website for free... don't remember at all what it was, and that's probably for the best!
Canada = C eh?
It's Tuvalu because of the .tv domain.  Edit: I'm wrong.
fun fact, .cat is primarily used for websites in Catalan
!! Sound the Klaxxon !! New Zealand mentioned !!
'Defunctries' is too good! I'm pretty sure I live in a defunctry..
Interestingly, _with the creation of the AT protocol, and increasing notoriety of the ActivityPub protocol,_ domains are kind of starting to become more visible and significant again... 😹
I will guess  Tuvalu because of .tv
Heck yeah I love Map Men! MAP MEN MAP MEN MAP MAP MAP MEN MEN
thank you how did i get here where is here anyway
Registered in the cook islands yeah? Well bum.
men    map    👍
University of hard knocks and Grange Hill 😂😂
This is the only channel that I watch the advert on, part of the entertainment 😊
I’m so, so happy to have another Map men video to view! 😃👏
To all the people complaining that Better Help is a terrible sponsor, leave Mark and Jay alone! You don't have to like it, and they are not responsible for vetting companies that buy ad space in their videos any more than a normal TV station would be. They are not wrong for taking a sponsorship, and as he said in a reply ad revenue is something he needs to keep this amazing channel alive. If you have airtime to sell, you sell it to the highest bidder end of story and that's how you make your money on TV and now on the internet. Does NBC endorse childhood obesity because they sell ad space to Coca Cola and McDonalds?   From what I've read about better help they are in fact a shit company only out for money. You can try to raise awareness about that in other ways but don't go after a mid sized youtube channel for taking some sponsorship money to stay afloat and create this content that we all enjoy.
TUVALU - Paused before starting the video. I better be right
Guess: .tv, Tuvalu
It always amuses me that the dark web, popular for... "legitimate" business dealings, uses the silliest sounding code: .onion  Yeah, I know it has to do with the Tor browser and the layers of protection and stuff... but an onion is the most benign sounding code imaginable.
Oh yes I have
If anyone wondered, ".cat" is for Catalonia, not actual cats.
Who else went to Jon Postel's grave page?
Please don't ever go to therapy, Jay - we need your ... _unique_ Youtube content. (btw., what happened to Monday? You caught me off-guard!)
Oh, lawks - that outro music!
IS IT IO
Thank you.
Thank you for the lovely video, though my condolences for locking in with a bad sponsor for an entire year.
Not gonna lie, as soon as I saw .tk on the map, I immediately knew the reason why it was there.  And I felt incredibly old in remembering when they were a thing.
I almost broke my arm patting myself on the back for "knowing" the answer was Tuvalu. Plot twist!
Babe wake up new map men dropped
I love how these guys use the rotating bar at the top right of the screen to indicate an ad is incoming.
Will non-earth based website use TLD or will it use something else? Instead of www. will the moon use lww. or Mars use mww.?
How does this video have 3.4M likes with less than 100k views?
Wait, Betterhelp? didn't they into a spot of bother a few years ago for a whole laundry list of issues? or am I thinking of a different company?
Fun fact: Flag emojis use 2 letters to comunicate wich emoji it is. The russian emoji is "RU", but in portuguese devices it is United Kingdom (Reino Unido). So when you translate the russian flag emoji to portuguese, it transforms into the UK flag. Edit: maybe this just works on the translate comment function on mobile youtube. Well at least its partially true! Its enough for a lot of people when it comes to other topics, so pretend its ok.
au mmmm gold
Woah, this 80 column style text is spot on!
That BBQ is literally my 2022-2023.
BetterHelp are incredibly toxic as a service provider guys please.
I want another ad for honey
This is the only channel I’ll sit through and actually enjoy the PAID PARTNERSHIP segment 🤣
That psychology crap is fucking stupid.
Without watching the video, my money is on Belgium because YouTube uses it all the time to shorten URLs
MAP BOYS
I’m gonna guess .tv from Tuvalu before the video starts. We shall see
America: Country Codes are for other countries that aren't AMERICA!  Damn, we got some minerals, don't we?
0:59 - US Veterans Affairs  6:05 - Soviet Union? I thought you guys broke up? ... YES THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED YOU TO THINK!
Finally ur backkkkkk
5:24 nailed the ats us nai
YOU'RE back!
I love how the URL in the video is actually real
Yay yay yay yay
I wonder how many websites are taken just to be referenced in (the background of) a youtube video for a couple of seconds.
Am I a man or am I a Muppet?
Haven’t seen it thinking Tuvalu for .tv though
Defruncties lol
"Forward slash" is a redundancy; There is "slash" and "backslash".
Tuvalu?  well, it was a good guess
Was expecting Tuvalu. Well played.
Can we have a long version of the end credits?
We may not access a site via url anymore, but the domain name is still pretty important, for safety for example
Also Tuvalu is soon not gonna exist anymore because of climate change
Why are all of the sudden many youtubers getting betterhelp sponsors? Wasn't it a scam and/or a bad service?
Informative, funny, and interesting all at the same time as usual gentlemen! This is honestly one of your best so far!
Ad still playing have only read title im guessing Tobago
If you didn't go to the URL at 5:42 you are missing out
The ad music... I've heard it before... And I'm embarrassed to say where
Map Men are entertaining
FALSE! I actually do give a second, sometimes even a 2.4th thought on Country Codes!
In one word: .perfect
Anna ♥
7:15 sort of true lol
Fun fact: Before DNS domains were managed by one woman and her team, who'd create the hosts file, and then everyone just had to make sure they had the latest hosts-file
More ads please
mapmen.funny
.tv?
Just started, going to take a wild guess that the most popular is Tuvalu?
I got a nice chuckle from the BASIC program on the wall at 1:08.
The size of .nl is still surprising to me.  For example, France has almost four times the population of the Netherlands but .nl is almost twice as large as .fr.
that's bad news, i have a .tk domain for my site...  i hope they let me keep renew it since i already have it...
You forgot to mention the amazing co.ck internet domain
Anything funny to say about BetterHelp's abuse of private patient data? Rohin Francis, over at Medlife Crisis, has made great fun of that not that long ago...
A new map man video!!!! This day can't be better!!!
This message comes to you through a layer of vaseline, as do I.
Try me!
a fun fact i have about tlds is that .cat is reserved for websites that are in the catalan language, and they send you a very angry email if you use it for furry shitposting instead
Reason to have country codes: It makes it very easy to have different languages, The French go for the .fr the Spanish for the .es and so on; easy to understand and implement.
Torquay mentioned 🥲*Agatha Christie noises intensify*
they actually claimed the domain for Jon Postel
You guys consistently make me smile with every upload. And that's not just a great feat on youtube! It's a great feat in life. Thanks so much for what you make, it's truly wonderful
Can we take a moment to appreciate that perfectly slightly-off music at the end?
Why is there a deepfake of Mark? 5:32
Excellent horrible guitar play
Hey where did my comment go? It was a cute Hello Internet reference.
Again pok part of pk, do you think there is any computer let alone a high bandwidth internet connection to a datacenter to host a server with pk tld
I can almost never bring myself to skip this channel's ad reads bc they're better than some actual videos on this platform
Tokelau, I've heard about it before. And or Tuvalu.
Hey Jay, could you imagine being the Doctor from Doctor Who while Mark plays the father of your companion?
1) I knew the answer, 2) no one says www -- they say dub dub dub. John Postel was a God. I used to teach parts of RFCs to engineers and I remember when he passed away in 1998 while I was teaching his material. Your John Postel, outfit is spot on.
i've heard of it
Please do not take money from better help. They are terrible.
Because money, and because money
Hi Jay.
Bold of them to assume that fans of a show called Map Men wouldn't known Tokelau from playing too many name-every-country Sporcle quizzes.
I need a copy of the "everything is fine" Postman Pat Theme
Tuvalu got real lucky with their .TV code
I live for the cuts to Mark in random locations
I have actually bought an SU domain for a year. Twas interesting trying to get it to work in communications with the Russian government.
.mom
"Kept a diary for 11 weeks (in a bag. Still unused but now lost)"
Damn straight the US doesn’t use country codes, USA USA 🇺🇸 !
5:21 what are those sticky-outty bits that are not part of GB?
MORE BEEF BUTTER? HELL YEAH!!!
I'm saving that "world according to the US map" 😂
I found something thats faster than light and its me clicking on this video
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo not betterhelp
Well i guessed so what now
Is there a source for all the data?
oo, ee, oo ah ah, ting tang, walla walla bing bang!
2:46 what are your 4 thoughts?
I do like the fact that the "What is my flag website" has a 'back to the video' button
The ccTLD for East Germany was .dd (GDR or in German DDR) But there were almost no websites because East Germany was behind the iron curtain.  When it finally tore up, .de was used for the whole of Germany.
Cameroon really hooked me up with my domain name.
3:06 No self-respecting programmer would spend half an hour doing something by HAND, like some sort of low-level peasant.
It's kind of startling to see the Netherlands this big on a world map. You don't even have to squint..
Tuvalu Edit: damn Edit 2: oh wait!
.cat is Catalonia
.bok .bok .bok .bok .bok .bgaaaaark
it's always dns
5:42 looks like he can't do the job anymore.
I recon its .nz
I love mapmen. You cheer me up.
i guess its tuvalu (.tv)
This was great! Thank you, Mr. MapMen! Misters MapMen? MapMen men? Man!
Map men are back.
did they forget .io on the map?
I've heard of Tokelau 🇹🇰 before you told me the fake news
.su not being retired after the collapse of the soviet union was the best news anyone had gievn me in years.
Excellent use of NZ flag/s.
...so what is the most popular internet country code then?
4:59 is the end of the ad, your welcome
I love the outro song
My favourite show on the planet. I hope you keep doing what you're doing. Explore old maps please
love the outro music
The cook islands have the best ccTLD ever created.
Every video is a delight ♥️👏👏👏
Always great videos :) Thanks!
Before watching the video, it's .tv for the country of Tuvalu.
.tv for tuvalu im guessing
.gq, .ga, .ml and .cf are also massively popular on that map for the same reason as .tk - they're also free.
@2:15 - They really need a new notation for dialing codes. One that makes sense given that most phone dialers don't have a "+"...
As someone that also nearly climbed Rosemany Topping with my mum, I approve of Cape Verde's computing contribution.
Where is Tom hatley ?
gonna guess .io as I start the video
It was the beginning of the internet
There's a huge mistake in this video: at 3:45 you've put in an advertisement for Betterhelp, I would suggest re-editing the video to remove this significant error.
What happened to Argentina in that map? :O
.bok .bok .bok .bok .bok to list a few of my favorite codes
wow! i sure am glad i stopped watching this map men episode at the end of part 1! nothing could go wrong!
Woo go Guernsey we got the gamer code!
The end of the video is interesting, because I feel the opposite. I find myself using the URL more often. A very prominent recent example is twitter. To view images in the highest quality possible on twitter you need to change a piece of the URL. Recently twitter's embed's were broken, and you have to change a piece of the URL to make them work. It is useful to understand youtube URLs too. Sometimes youtube puts extra junk onto the url, such as feature, time, and playlist, and removing them or manipulating them can be a powerful tool. Lastly, some sites are faster to access via URL than with search.
Tuvalu is my guess
I think Canada likes it because it is supposed to help make sure people go on the Canadian version of a company's website rather than the American.
What does .io mean then
What I'm wondering is why they didn't mention .io, for the British Indian Ocean Territory
As someone recently divorced with a recently dead cat and a bunch of angry letters from financial institutions, 3:47 feels strangely personal.
Fun Fact: .dd was or rather have never been the ccTLD for the former German Democratic Republic.
That Ad made me realise that Jay is Todd Howard
ccTLDs make sense as a convenient unit ti break down authority. Similarly i fully expect .mars to eventually be a thing, roughly partitioning the internet into "the Earth internet" and "places too far to make a real-time phone call to earth"
it's .tv
I feel old as I had a dot tk for my personal website. 😂
It's always a good day when Jay foreman posts.
Devon mention
Great inclusion of Evil Edna! 😂
that's one way to get New Zealand onto a map
Hi Jay. My company is currently looking for a DNS support engineer to join our team. After a glimpse at this part of your resume I'd like to invite you to a job interview. Kindly let me know if you are open to explore this opportunity. Best regards, Tony.
The wasp-like ads is so damn accurate, and I find it actually worrysome.
India has the best code .in 😁
I love men (who talk about maps)
8:41 well well, I never knew that british comedian Rob Beckett also did business under the alias Joost Zuurbier
Nice game gear reference
.bunghole! LOL.
I like how .va is 404
I DID!!!!! I GUESSED IT!!! YOU WERE WRONG!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHA
huh discords part of Guernsey technicaly
aw, you didn't talk about non-latin-alphabet domains like .рф
Technically DNS servers don't send the dots. They send 4 8 bit numbers, assuming we're talking IPv4. The dots are just for human friendly representation.  IIRC United Kingdom has *two* TLDs, .uk and .gb, which lead to Ukraine which should have had .uk getting .ua instead.
For anyone interested in far too much additional detail (and why control of ccTLDs actually does matter), check out the book "Networks and States" by Milton Mueller. For a book from 2010, it's still really useful (except its discussions of content regulation).
The various TLDs at 10:35 were hilarious! That one song*, the chicken noise*, and .etc! Brilliant!  I don't think I'd hire Toby Le Squids though... 8 schools in one year...   *Yes, I was reading them out loud - yes, I did only realise what I sang and what noise I made after I had done that. Well played.
All that matters is *MX* is the raddest, the coolest, the best sounding!
I’m impressed with how well done the badly played rendition of London Bridge is
That outro had me turning in my chair laughing. Nice strings Jay
outro song 🔥
okay just how many of these fake-looking IP adresses am I expected to type into my browser?
I comment
Love your disturblingly funny outros!
Even before the video starts, I'm putting this out there; Tuvalu
gov and mil have US-centrism as policy, even. They're specifically for the US federal government and US Department of Defense.
You forgot to mention the cool internationalized TLDs for countries that use non-Latin writing systems! Probably not as interesting as the rest of the video content, but an interesting thing for language enthusiasts nonetheless!  Especially when the writing direction is something other that left to right!
It was the beginning of the Internet!
A day is better with a dose of mapmen
ATS US NAI!
tuvalu
map men map map map men men men men
Tuvalu
Tuvalu?
Was a Saffer responsible for the TLD list ? At 10:39 - 5 references to .bok.
I love when someone names a 'fake' URL as a joke, and then follows through by actually making the website 😂
I will, it's Tuvalu
I was waiting this whole video for a reference to businesses registered in the Cook islands.
The only channel I’d watch just for the ads 😂
Isn't better help a scam? Or did they finally hire licensed professionals
Dang, I was convinced it was Tuvalu
Telling me I've never heard about the legendary .tk is a bit of an insult, really.
BetterHelp sells your information to highest bidder. Including what you say to your therapist. There are multiple lawsuits ongoing. Don't use it.
I now want a bgaaaaark domain name.
Haven't watched it yet, it's Tuvalu because .tv, if I guess it correctly I will file a suit on this video because it incorrectly assumes that I'm stupid and won't know the answer  Edit: ehh close enough, expect to hear from my lawyers Jay.
5:42 not a real website 😭
Maybe the most interesting effects of resizing countries by a statistic that I've seen, The Cape of Good Hope is now in Equatorial Guinea, Gabon has swapped its Atlantic coast for an Indian Ocean coast, and Palau has come up with a great solution to all those territorial disputes over the South China Sea.
my dad always said .tk = .trojan-keylogger
Haven't watched the video yet, but my money is on Tuvalu.  Here's what I'm guessing is the top 5: 1. Tuvalu 2. British Indian Ocean Territory 3. China 4. Italy 5. Cocos Islands  Tokelau was once big, but not anymore.
Google maps peoples are back
.io
The outro is killing me
Awesome video!
2:51 country code for benin is .bj, i am surprised its not popular...
:)
What a pleasant surprise!
nice vid
Before watching im going to go all in with .cat Vinga Catalunyaaa
Hey Map Men! This was a great video as always but you made a small mistake around 10:35 when you talk about "too specific TLDs" like .ninja and .cat.  Even though it might seem like the .cat domain was originally made for cat-related content (and is probably used for that to an extent) it was originally created and used for Catalan speaking organisations and stuff in Catalonia, a Spanish region.   Here local governments and stuff like that will use the .cat domain instead of .es. I think that other regions of Spain have their own TLDs, like .gal for Galícia.
Is this map available as jpg/png?
Great video Jay
Good video, but you guys accepted a sponsorship from BetterHelp? Really? They are famously incredibly scummy.
That outro song is amazing.
How did they do a whole.video and not reference Nathan barley......Co.ck
Before watching the video, I hope they mention the cook island TLD
Remember the Geocities days where you'd use a tk domain to redirect to your site to make it seem way more official.
Wonder if we're gonna have to swap .uk for .gb if Ireland is ever reunified...
is it EN-US?
Will there be a pr0n parody of Map Men called Fap Men?
I could feel the pain in that last bit
I once met a chap who was very good at picturing Devon. It’s a neat talent
.bok, .bok, .bok. I’m a 🐓.
Valuable info, good humor...time well spent. That green screen bit was hopefully deliberate!
.cat is the official domain of Catalonia. So it is not a meme domain.  https://ca.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/.cat
The answer is .com as it's international
Funny men 🎉
Is it Tuvalu?
So good
All I need on a Thursday evening is some men
2:37 disappointed by lack of laser kiwi
Map men, map men, map map map men men
Doesn't the country of Tuvalu make a metric shit tonne (technical economic term by the way) by selling the rights to their internet code of .tv?
ahhh man the ONLY channel where I not only look forward to the paid sponsor but ended up laughing out loud during it, thank you!
Hire more people so you can bring these out weekly lol ❤
Writing during the ads: It's gonna be .tv for Tuvalu!
I enjoy maps and men so I *REALLY* enjoy this channel!❤
I guessed it, now what?
This is wrong.  "When computers looked like this" - showing a mid 80s IBM compatible PC.  The web didn't get invented until 1993.  There were no browsers "when computers looked like this". Then, the image shown of the browser is described as "the internet". No, it isn't - that's the WEB, which is part of the Internet as a whole.  Sorry guys you need to do way more research on this - the video is full of technical and date errors.
Honestly, some of these country TLDs are less so country TLDs but language TLDs
The bit at around 3:48 was pretty interesting to pause and read through
Yuuuuh
wait, there must have been a TLD with some adult connection, wink , wink, nudge nudge and we are old enough to hear it!
"Joost Zuurbier" is the new record for most Dutch name I've ever heard.
.cm also used to be popular with scammers
a lot of catalonian goverrment facilites use the .cat one to be anoying
Ich was hier
This comment won’t get more then 5 likes
Guessing it before watching the video It's gonna be Tuvalu      Edit: It was the scamster infested .tk that got the most cTLD
So much informative and so much educational, lads.
There is no .bok TLD :( I was so excited
Why am I seeing this minutes after getting my new internet netwrok?
The UK government set up an organisation to look at AI. And used .ai in the website address. This means it is not subject to UK data protection laws. It is important that the laws of the internet are not governed or enforced.
10:35. .cat is actually mostly used by the Catalan-speaking community, rather for cat-related websites. I came across a few companies using it when I visited Catalonia last year.
At least the video is over 11 minutes long. That makes up for the time I've been waiting for one
10:12 😡absolutely fuming at this video. In the background, the globe can be seen, and it's shown to be tilted. Yet when the camera cuts to Mark, it's parallel with the table!? To think that you could upload this video. Expect a deluge of angry letters sometime withing the next three months. Disliked and unsubscribed
Brilliant as always. Educational and entertaining. Like wasps.
The video's title was correct. I guessed it would be Tuvalu and was wrong. Does that officially mean itxs not clickbait?
7:29 Instead of USA, it should say 'Murica
We were so lucky the early Internet folks were odd techno-hippies who thought about the future, rather than modern day tech bros focused on the next IPO
British cars should have kept GB, despite excluding Northern Ireland. The reason for these car stickers is to help drivers outside of your home country. Greece uses GR rather than their own name, Ellas, for instance. UK is too easily confused with Ukraine.  GB translates well  French - Grande Bretagne German - Grosse Brittanen Italian - Gran Bretana Spanish - Gran Bretaña  What about UK? The United Kingdom? French - Royaume Uni German - Vereinigtes Königreich Italian - Regno Unito Spanish - Reino Unido  Ru? Oh, its taken as well.
So (as a Citizen of the Realm of New Zealand) I knew about Tokelau, and even went to school with a Tokelauan. Perhaps you should do a video on New Zealand's attempt to create an empire under Prime Minister Richard Seddon (aka King Dick) and it's own decolonisation story with German Samoa, Cook Islands and a rather large chunk of Antarctica.
Yay, Map Men was only on hiatus, not finished.  Thanks guys, er men.
Pre watch guess, Tuvalu because I see ".tv" ads on television all the time
I generally like the ad reads but Better Help is a scummy company. They claim to use real therapists but often the people working for them are not licensed, sometimes at best have an 2year online degree in psychology. Oh, and Better Help has been caught sharing user data with other companies. Their refund policies are abysmal, you have to pay upfront before you can find out availability, and then if there's no one at suitable times and you cancel you're left with trying to make use of 2 am sessions rather than being refunded.   Don't support Better Help. They steal your data and match you with unlicensed therapists.
MAP MENNN! I love the content <3 I gotta get some of that sweet merch
i just watched their internet cable one like an hour ago cus i missed them... what a coincidence
Tuvalud mi nuts
Favourite Youtube channel EVER
i love the end song and the cutoff
I have One Question .. Some one happens to give me Sun Magazine from UK .. It was quite 68 pages.. They are praising their King and Queen and some pages on celebrities thats all fine  now i want to know that having TV guide still a thing in Britain ? .. Basically in India People have given up on Classic TV (Mostly) everyone watch thing in Apps Netflix, Amazon, Disney and many many local .. I want to know like British people still see TV guides and yes Advert of Vaccum claners .. Like so 1990 .. Is all news papers and magazine are like that?
I need that waffle iron. Need.
3:13 New ringtone, anyone?
Is it Tuvalu/TV?
I know people that don’t even type in the url but rather search on google and then click from there.
Is it Tuvalu?
Map men are back! We are so uppp
Yeah, I remember .tk domain names! They were all the craze back in high school here in the Netherlands.
So kind of the cartography gentlement to venture out from their timeless vacuum and grace us with another video
the best thing you can do is to repeatedly press the 0 (zero) key
.cat is for catalonia not for cat lovers, Sorry to bring the bad News
Damn those wasps.
tuvalu
Good to see @technologyconnections is a patron. Both great channels
.TV for Tuvalu?
I literally said ‘come on!’ Out loud when I saw this pop up when I was on the train
Interesting timing for this video, especially with a certain Karen in American politics recently using articles from a website with a .SU domain
Upvote for Evil Edna.
These two deserve their own show
Before watching video:  It’s Tuvalu
I thought that Map Men wasn't timely anymore. But it's back! Awesome!
Yes we own the code you silly foreigners
You are right, I had guessed Tuvalu :)
Bok
That my fair lady hurt me
They’ve finally got a new video… : )
Listening to thin lizzys ‘the boys are back in town’ as I watch this
A very unfunny fact: Though the full official  name for UK in Norway is "Det forente kongeriket Storbritannia og Nord-Irland" (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), we don't have a similar term to United Kingdom (or simply UK) in Norwegian. Refering to to the country as "Det forente kongeriket" or "DFK" is simply unheard of. (Wikipedia states that the short form is "Det forente kongedømmet", but nobody has ever said that)  So the (not full) official name is Storbritannia (Great Britain), the same term we use for the island. It's confusing and stupid, but there we are.  So, while refering to the country as Great Britain in English is wrong, in Norwegian it's actually correct.  (This is of course not spesific to Norway. This goes for all the Scandinavian countries, at least)
What Country Code will Bougainville get when they become independent?
Map men evolving from paper maps to digital maps
Damnit, I was assuming the title was about .tv; I've never heard of .tk websites
yeah i can edit : apparently I could not.
I can't believe you added so many Aotearoa NZ flags but not the correct one (laser kiwi)
BRO I LITERALLY JUST REWATCHED LIKE 3 OF YOUR VIDEOS HOOOOWWWW
"The world default country" made my day
But where does the co in .co.uk come from?
I don't even feel like skipping your ad inserts. Great job :)
Incredible
Before I watch the video I will guess that it’s .tv for Tuvalu
It’s .tv isn’t it?  Edit: Hm it was .tk.
Wow, can you even _imagine_ 4000 people using the internet? I wonder if that will ever happen, or it was just a prediction
😂🤣😂🤣” the USA, which considers itself the worlds default country”. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello sir, it's long time no see
10/10 for "on long island" instead of "in" it as if everybody is buried underground
ATS US NAAAIII
Duuuude I need to get myself a .bgaaaaark domain.
10:53 I’m assuming using the same sound as Tom Scott did for his video about popups was intentional
Tuvalu?
ATS US NAI
Map.
2:37 Where is the laser kiwi????
0:45 fun fact: the Space Jam website is still on, pretty much unchanged since the movie's release in 1996! You can go there and get a peak at what a 1990s website looked like
Map men!!
Beef butter is best butter. Same with beef milk.
ussicibasimcr
the dns addict in me exploded seeing this video
Thanks to you I’ll probably remember ISO 3166-1 for the rest of my life
I was born and bred on .gg, AMA
And now to wait for another 2 months for the next MapMen episode
I'm assuming it's .ck
Did you know that BetterHelp was founded by soldiers of an apartheid ethnostate that is currently committing genocide and it has a very questionable ethical history? Get better sponsors
Christmas and Hanukkah came early
Favorite channel! Obvi!
Still can't believe that people accept sponsorships from betterhelp
Posting before watching: it's Tuvalu right
Quality video as usual 😅
Kayman island ccTLD please :AAAAAA
Oh man, .tk brings back memories! Getting a proper domain for an Angelfire or Geocities site was... magical.
Fun fact: Argentina's domain name is the most popular one for piracy-related activities.
the cook islands is the best. www.google.co.ck 😂
Oh, now I get it. (No, I don't.)
He’s back!
9:49 Sardinia is Italy. Not so smart of you map men
What a lovely surprise to wake up to a Map men video
PLEASE don't let BetterHelp sponsor ever again please - do some quick research into the profit over userbase company..
but... but... isn't .cat primarily used for Catalan-speaking websites? that's what i've been thinking for literal years now :_)
You guys are hilarious. I was so happy to see a new video from you.
Hey, I successfully guessed you'd go over Federated Micronesia and their .fm domain.
Can't believe they forgot to include the Epic Kiwi Shooting Laser Beams flag for Aotearoa - New Zealand!
“Because money, and because money”. Amazing
Yeay!
the reason .us is so rare is the same reason British stamps don't have the country's name on them.
at the start of the vid. i'm guessing tuvalu (tv)
2:36 I see what you did there with New Zealand. We all know that there are is only one well designed flag in that bunch though.
.ooheeeohohahhahhtingtangwallawallabingbang
I never click on click bait titles but I know you guys make good quality videos. I can't miss a single one of them
A genuinely needed map men video
10:53 The tune that plays when your makeshift mini-bridge made of only toothpicks collapses into an impossible game of pick-up-sticks
2:37 the blink and you'll miss it nod to New Zealand's flag referendum was appreciated.  Sound the the Aotearoa Mentioned klaxon!
.TV Tuvalu?
Brooo you left out Sardinia in the Italy map
Hehe cartography mens go view
I called .tk being big at the start and I was right. I had a .tk registered website back in '06, as did a lot of other amateur webbuilders.
Betterhelp is not professional. Have you heard about the “Have you tried not being gay” incident?
Without watching the video, .tv
.tk was an amazing resource for me as an aspiring web developer in my teens. I didn't have my own money yet and my parents weren't crazy about the idea of using a CC online yet. Getting a free .tk domain name was basically the only way for me to get a domain name for a while there.
does that mean all the adult sites could use their obvious intended domain, .cum?
my guess before watching - whatever country code is ".tv" or ".io"
Love you
Fun fact: .tf is often used for websites connected to Team Fortress 2, a video game
therapists aren't people
I wouldn't say no to coming back to that typing website addresses manually - I work as the IT service desk for US company and users are stumbled when I ask them to "go to the website". If it's not showing on the first page of google results, it means that the website doesn't exist.
Before watching: Is it Tuvalu?
2:00 To make this even funnier, this video has gotten 33,000 views in 33 mins.
the twitch.tv fact blew my mind for no reason
10:53 I wanna try beef butter. It sounds horrendous.
Oh boy I sure do love seeing Ads for scam adjacent better help. Ads are fine and necessary but better help are just bad
men map men map men men men map map
No sound?
Joost zuurbier means 'sour bear' in dutch
Why does Germany has so much more than france for example? It‘s crazy!
Of course pineapple.pizza is taken 🤣
loved this one thank you
You are promoting a truly evil company. Not raidshadowleggings level "controversial". Literally a mental health organisation just recently fined millions for selling patient info to facebook. Bad enough that even lazy and corrupt goverment caught up to them.   Disappointed and unsubsribed.
I finally get to add something to one of these videos. At the end of each url there is also an invisible '.' which is the root domain, you can manually at this . at the end of your url which has the dns search go (in theory) to the 'root domain' server first which in turn tells it what top level domain server address to go to
But they kinda forgot to answer the question, they said that .tk no longer is the most used. So what is??
5:02 so called "Map Men" used wrong map of the internet! What a shame! Map Men did a mistake. Slovakia is souvereign state since 1993 and has country code ".sk". Or are we so insignificant?
9:49 bodge (full stop) it is a real website. Check it out
5:34 No one talking about IBM 😂
.io, for all the techies, refers to Indian Ocean.   "It's an area of economic interest",...according to an episode of the waveform podcast 🤓
(≠D)
These maps really are the maps of app time
"Yurp" 😂
The new outro music SLAPS
Obligatory reminder that Betterhelp is an awful service you shouldn't use
hello map men
It was the beginning of the internet!
Mapmapmapmapmapmapmap.tk
Cartoons by Witchdoctor. You are welcome. Also, cracking outro.
Map men is a classic and every second i look at the views they go up by 100
10:53 the outro djingle is a masterpiece of its own 😅
Tuvalu?
Twitch being based in Tuvalu is one of the greatest geo-electronic revelations of the 2020s
I think many of the spammers & other shady websites have moved to places like .to which also belongs to an obscure Island not far from New Zealand. Where you can pick up the country code whilst not being required to provide public registar information.
I'm still surprised that cook islands doesn't have a booming porn site industry
pre-vid prediction: tuvalu
In fairness .cat is actually short for Catalonia
I checked the Jon Postel grave... "site"... (wait, is that a double entendre or something?) so you don't have to. Sadly, it does not work.
Im the .no one would ever ask someone what the most popular internet country code is...
I like the part that goes... Map Men, Map Men, Map Men, Map, Map, Men, Men
Tuvalu?
i knew it was tv xD cause of twitch
All hail the Wasps!
And a fun tidbit about the .nu TLD is that Sweden has a very strict policy for registering domains with the ccTLD .se, and since .nu is pronounced nu, which is Swedish for now, many Swedish companies registered their websites with the .nu TLD instead. Plus it was also in many cases cheaper than .se. I even had a .nu website for a while in the late 90's before I got old enough to register my company and get my .no domain in Norway.
why do I only know learn that my city has it's own code.cologne
This show is basically geography class to Americans who didn’t learn it in high school
Ah lads not the betterhelp sponsorship
Love this channel. Fuck BetterHelp.
Posted the day after my computer science exam.
I actually feel sickened by that better help sponsorship. Exploiting the most vulnerable members of your audience by marketing them an expensive mental health service with a dubious track record that can't give patients a meaningful diagnosis or prescription and will cost people a fortune as it can't be covered by insurance is sickening. There will be people suffering so much mentally that watch your videos to make themselves feel better. People that really need access to antidepressants or a diagnosis so they are entitled to time of work that will instead get scammed by an expensive therapist on a flashy app. Go back to peddling online learning services. They aren't any good but at least they're only ripping off people that want to learn video editing and not financially ruining vulnerable people.
7:15 this is correct and based
Why does Denmark look like unorganised blubber on your map?
im guessing .tv
I bought myself a .moe domain, cause why use country codes if you can be moe.
You guys do for maps what Chris Morris does for News. KEEP IT UP!
I love Map Men.
Map men outros continue to traumatise me
The niche category of foreign.  😂😂😂
Obviously the most popular internet country code is .cat
What kind of heathen views twitch.tv in *light mode* ?!
To be honest, I still think country codes are rather useful. For me as a German, when a site has a .de option, it will mean that the site will most likely be optimized for German usage. It means I can assume that there is shipping to Germany, that has, if not completely in German by default, a German version available. So, even though I speak good enough English that I can communicate outside of my nations Internet, it still is beneficial for me to prefer the German nation code as I don't have to look at that website if stuff I buy has to be importet or not.
0:39 So that's what it looks like before turning into fine dust!
9:53 the moment i was waiting for: who .nu belongs to and if other countries than sweden likes to use it
.tv?
8:38 Dankpods reviews moment
Blind guess: Tuvalu?
4:54 What a great visual representation of betterhelp
Under 30ming gang 👇
you can also have domains name in non-Latin script !!
9:00 so Mark and Jay didn't go on vacation to Tokelau?
5:42 Well, it'd be rude _not_ to try.     Yeah, the URL's bupkis. Sad.
I did actually lol. Last time I checked, there were 4 free TLDs, but I don't recall them right now. I used to be a broke student who wanted a website, so I set up a website with a free tld, only for it to be blocked everywhere as a scam website lol
It's obviously .TK. Tokelau gave them away for free years ago, I remember people spinning up .TK websites for free over a decade ago. Would be surprised if it wasn't.
As a pirate, my guess is .to
before watching the video: it's Tuvalu isn't it  edit: uh
Beef butter is back!
As an americain i was in my late teens before i realized that country codes exist
It's .tv
What ccTLD will independent Scotland have?
Frome
Oh no, I usually switch off any video sponsored by BetterHelp because they're absolutely awful. Going to assume you didn't know about the damage they've done to their poor patients (and therapists too). Please listen to the comments and don't promote them any further.
.oooh .eeee .ooohahhahh .ting .tang .wallahwallah .bing and .bang is my favorite domain name
Algo
Ahhh, another map men video, life is good, gentlemen
If the Monty Python team had developed a hyper-specific interest in maps and made a YouTube channel, they'd still have to sweat to make something this good!
Commenting before the video that I think it might be .gg
I love you guys but seriously?  Betterhelp?
Please do not take sponsorship from BetterHelp
Torquay 😄😄
Psa:betterhelp is a steaming pile of garbage that sold people's private data to facebook. Do not under any circumstances use it, the ftc is after them for good reason
I was hoping you'd mention the government of Niue suing the government of Sweden for stealing their .nu ccTLD
2:37 As a New Zealander, I can confirm we do have six official flags
Guess before watching: Tuvalu
1:12 I appreciate the Amstrad CPC Locomotive BASIC there
5:28 You can't fool me, neuro-Mark!
Not a subject of great interest to me but with you chaps' engaging skills I was grateful that I had watched and thank you for the education. Bravo boys and on to the next one.
why am i reminded of dank pods at 8:40 mark ???
The outro has this strange feeling of being complete and incomplete at the same time
We have to admire jon postel for his hair
:D
0:29 - well done to the graphic artist who distorted the map following the contours of the green screen held by Mark and Jay!
5:42 did Jon Postal really put a website on his headstone?
Map Men! 🙂
im not sure what the video is yet but i guess tuvalu
Space Jam! Unfortunately that link now sends you to stuff related to the newer, inferior film. You need to put /1996 on the end for the OG now
Before watching this, I guess .tv -Tuvalu.
Don't use better help. A while ago they were caught selling patient information to advertisers.
Cook Islands?
yay
Better Help are shady and have some terrible practices, have a quick google next time before pointing your viewers towards them please?
Another funny example of a ccTLD being used for an unintended purpose is .tf, intended for the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, but in actuality mainly used for stuff related to Team Fortress 2.
You two don't post new videos often enough, but when you do, I ROFLMAO
You should look into better help. Apparently they are a scam. They do not have real therapists.
5:34 I think it supposed to be Irritable Bowel Syndrome!!
It's a bit paradoxical how many ccTLDs are "de". The former German chancellor called the Internet "Uncharted Territory" just a few years ago...
5:28 whats up with the shot of Mark-Cooper Jones here? It looks like his body is getting distorted in photoshop. Not bad, just odd.
11:07 proudest moment of my life
My guess (before watching the video) would be .tv from Tuvalu.
this is awesome just today i was recommending one of your videos to my history teacher and now this?
guess before watching: tv or tuvalu
Fantastic episode as always.
lemme guess tuvalu?
NEW ZEALAND FLAG JOKE!!!
We use .nu so much in the Netherlands, so it's interesting to see that it's actually meant for another country
Love the videos but disappointing to see a betterhelp sponsor on this.
It’s back baby!
quality content as always :) cheers Map Men
Map Men, Map Men, Map, Map, Map, Men, Men.  I love Map Men!
is it tuvalu
Omg, I was just thinking about MapMan and here it is another video.
That outro song is majestic!
.gg for guernsey is a common gaming one
THE WAFFLE MAKER AT O:38 I CANTTTTTT HAHAHAHAHA
3:41 southern
Babe wake up, new Map Men video just dropped!
Finally I can catch up this funny duo’s video 😂😂😂 Thank you for all of these valuable knowledges of UK and above!
Calling it it’s Tuvalu’s
Here at 14,139 views.
Please do not advertise BetterHelp, its a scam
Maybe Tuvalu will earn the money from ccTLD rather than tax and tourism.
.tv?
Without watching I'm gonna go with .tv Edit. Ok I was wrong ;) just a bit.
The .cat TLD is for the catalan language, not the animal.
"Babe, wake up. There's a new map men episode"
As an American, your description of how we think of country codes was 100% on point
im not sure what it is but what is that buggy part in the top right corner?, i feel like i've seen it in other videos
I knew about the .tk story (am Dutch), but not that it was outdated. So I didn't guess but was still wrong...
Betterhelp is basically a scam. It has horrible reviews and it literally ruined people's lives. Not only does it provide questionable professionals and has terrible support, it also leaks data to advertisers, which is insanely unethical for the type of service it is.

2:22 Where did Mark go on vacation?
The men of the map are back
I’ve been lost for so long. Thank god the map men are back
I had forgotten about the winning “country”! Great stuff
I had a . tk domain 😂
We are all stupid
I love this episode so much :)
Great, ISO 3166-1 is gonna be burned into my memory forever now since you put it to song. It's 0-118-999-881-999-119-725-3 all over again.
hey guys, I admire your videos, but you should reconsider which sponsors you take, as Betterhelp has had its good share of controversies, including, but not limited to: - Selling personal data of its users - Predatory charging methods - its workers being of questionable quality, with some of them being unlicensed psychologists and some reportedly just saying people to "get over it"
Thanks Mapmen for this educative video as usual.😊
"ccTLD" in my brain was "closed captioning too long didn't" so... my brain is sad.
The editing of these video never fails to make me laugh. The graphic blocking Jay's face is just top tier metahumor.
I used to see a lot of .tk domains back in the day, never knew the reason why..
a
Torquay mentioned 🔊🗣️🗣️
So weird that the United States country code is “.us” and not “.usa”
You're right, but only because I won't try to guess.
I am politely asking you to stop having BetterHelp as a sponsor. I know they keep the lights on for you Mr. Foreman but they are an insidious company. I wouldn't be opposed to another Surfshark VPN ad though!
Is it the Cook Islands?
Jay foreman is great
Please don't do BetterHelp sponsorships again. They're a quite abusive corporation, see Jacob Geller's & others reporting on them - sacrificing their users and therapists mental health for profits.
0:39 i love how they depicted the vision of humanity on computers at that time in the form of a waffle iron
Commenting my guess before watching, it's .tv
Map men map men map map map men men
i was really hoping uyou bought up .tk
Nice to know stuff
Haven’t watched it yet but I assume it’s .tv for Tuvalu
Having not watched the video yet, my guess is .tv  Edit: aw
Loved that they used Space Jam as it is still active like 30 years later.
ISO-3166-1🎵🎵🎵
Why ian't .scot mentioned?
Omfg 3:40 the ol’ top right “ad break” blip marker 🤣
sad to see that the jon postel website link doesn't exist
Prediction: it is “.fm” for Federated States of Micronesia  Edit: Ah, crud. Never even heard of .tk 😅
Cool
So glad Jay (& Mark) are back!!!!
Yayyyy! Map men map men map map map men men men.   I love that intro. It makes me inordinately happy for some reason.
9:50 .gg and proud!!!!!! 🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬
Yay, map men, I love the comedy and education, it hurts my brain in a good way....
Map Men is the best thing on the internet
First - on this server.
I never gave this a thought, but thanks for posting this!
YAYYYYYY NEW MAP MEEEEEEEN!
Why isn't the intro song unusual this time?
If Map Men aren't getting paid the GDP of Slovakia for every ad, they're getting ripped off
It was the beginning of the Internet.
Bet it’s Tuvalu
That barbercue went very wrong... 😂
my father beats me severely
IP maps? WHAT A CONCEPT!  Are BitMaps next? :O
.funny
And here I thought it would be Tuvalu.
Is it Tuvalu?
I in fact did guess the most popular internet country code
You didnt have to do New Zealand like that with the flags 😭
Map Men, they’re the men, and them’s the maps 😁👍
Map men map men map men map men men men
My day just got a lot better ❤
yay
Bet its .io
who knew mark was a centrist
My appetite for amusing videos about maps has been sated... for a time
my fav series on youtube, then unfinished london
I would guess it's Tuvalu's. Edit: It wasn't, but it came up.
0:43 wow look a reference where you type the magic word at the end of a command line in order for it to be executed
wow
nice
Anna sent you (7) photos   Such a classic 😂
wow managed to log onto youtube the same minute this episode came out!!
forward/titles
new episode, yay
Map men map men map map map men
I am a simple man. I see Map Men vid, I click.
50+ comments in 1 minute. Damn
So freaking exciting ❤❤😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
love you guys !
Map men are back
I’m guessing .tv from Tuvalu. £5 if I get it right 🤝
MAP MEN!
twitch going bankrupt after climate change sinks tuvalu into the ocean:
Guessing its tuvalu  Edit: they got me
I got here within a minute! Yay!  Edit: Really liked this episode. Especially the ad in the middle. There is nothing quite like having it be very clear to you that a video is sponsored then someone screaming: "PAID PARTNERSHIP" in your ear. I also enjoyed the humour of the ad, ever since you put the ads in the middle I've watched them and I haven't been disappointed yet. The episode itself was also stellar, but that goes without saying.
.tv i bet
Am I the only one that's not saying first?
Oh my goodness it is map men 🎉🎉
Early prediction: It's Tuvalu
I hope you're having a good day Jay, thanks for the vid :)
First 🎉
Hi
Before watching the video, is it GG?
Huzzah, another video of quality amidst a sea of YouTube Garbage
I get so much joy from map men episodes
Looking forward to this!
Les go
um actually i will guess it, tuvalu
pretend I said something witty and informative relating to the video
Prediction: it’s not gonna be .TV and we’re all gonna look silly!  Edit: 9:25 yay
First comment! ... oooooh :/
