That’s rangers top of the table for most penalties received, while still being the only team to not concede a penalty so far this season. I can’t believe our luck great performance!
🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️
Sakalas pace is frightening, he'll be off soon at this rate.
Dodgie ref n var yet again
Have rangers set a new record.That’s 87 straight games with a dodgy penalty
Scotland's most successful football club doing what they do best💙❤️
A good Win but chasing it again after losing 1st goal good job not an easy place
Fs🇿🇲 making us proud
Bsbehenduen
Tony colak🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷😍
Ian Durrant dived.
The Ranjurs r back...thats 1 goal back on goal difference...😅😅😂😂😂🤣
Never a free kick for the first goal! Ref at fault against Rangers there! Bad decision! Great play Rangers! 😁🥳👍
Another penalty to save him haha nonsense. Good god another pass to them to score on 3rd goal
Easy 👍👍👍👍👍
Thought the Hibs ‘were back’ got too be there in the first place too be back 🤣🤣
Fkn Cinch Fag Ad 👎
Penalty fc
Rangers highlights 87k people Celtic highlights 197k 😂. We all know who the biggest and best team in Scotland is. Hail hail
WHERE'S THE COMMENTARY YOU CHEAP SPAZZES.
And some say wee Fashion isn’t a striker - that turn and shot was out of the top drawer. Totally bamboozled the Hibs defence
Cantwell is so good on his feet, Sakala and Jack were great too.
Just need the other team to start dropping some points
Some of the football played in this game was outstanding yet the SPFL 'highlights' video somehow manages to show none of that! Pathetic!
Why he even lookin at VAR fuckin stone Waller
9pts lol. Poor east end off edinburgh having the mighty unwashed in town
That first penalty was a dive! Give that man a gold medal!
Go Zambia go eyes on the ball
Is it just me or is sakala getting better with his feet. He seems to be controlling it alot better than hes ever done...
clowns probably think they'll in the league now
No commentating
Where's the other 100 chances we created 🤔 ....Too many highlights for the spfl tae show i take 🤔
That midfield with Tillman as a false 9 in front could be interesting.
It makes my day watching all the tottie pickers on here commenting on a rangers video🤭 ....We live Rent free in their tiny little empty heads 😏
Que Deus distribua muitas bênçãos por todos neste novo ano que está começando!
Do people actually find this league entertaining
Great performance, absolutely ruthless at times, this is the type of performance needed every time we play the unwashed 🇬🇧
I'm actually embarrassed for Dom Robertson. How he needed VAR to tell him to look at that pen again given the view he had of it beggars belief. Did he forget we had VAR and think he would get away with one again. This guy along with Muir sneaks under the radar cos gollum and Clancy are that bad.
Another rangers player deliberately standing on a defenders boot and being rewarded a penalty. Absolute madness
Cant belive paarents give him that name 😀👏👏👏👏
“He’s come from Zambia” 🇿🇲
That'll be the starting 11 going forward ..... I hope
If only that was the starting XI against the nappy rippers. If only.
Rampant Gers.Teriffic.!!
never a penalty
Top-notch commentating.
Sakala doing the lord’s work 🇿🇲
Shame gers can't do that Vs septic when it matters home or away or at Hampden
Last time gers done that at er they lost the Scottish cup final to Hibs .could happen again
Awesome performance from the  GERS,
Wish that midfield started Vs Tarriers.. The burners were lucky it wasn't double figures last night
How many penalties have RIFC had this season
That penalty decision was soft . It was never a pen football has become soft .
Give Jacko a contract it's a no brainer. Give it to him.
He comes from, 🇿🇲🇿🇲⚡
Hi
these highlights don't justifie just how good rangers were Jacko was boss he was so boss he could put the hugo boss range out of buisness that has to be the team going forward no question .... 🔴⚪🔵🇬🇧🇬🇧☝️
Sakala been Rangers best player second half of the season I’m glad he’s back form under GIO he was struggling for game time
A younger goalkeeper dives for the first goal. McGregor just doesn’t seem to try anymore.
Colak’s desire to actually beat a defender to the front post and move to find space in the box along with the hunger to work for the team defensively is why he should be our 1st choice striker from now on… currently unless we’re in possession and the ball is played straight into Morelos’ feet it’s like playing with a man down… not to mention the fact that more often than not Colak’s good for a couple of goals when he’s fully fit… 17 goals in less than 23 games (by mins played) isn’t too bad a return for someone who’s been injured and been a bit part player for the majority of the season
The pride of the east end and still 9 clear
HE COMES FROM ZAMBIA ❤️🤍💙
Why are theRangers virtually guaranteed a penalty in 99% of SPL games? Kinda puts viewers off. Atleast other teams are where they are on merit tho i suppose.
Penalty RANGERS...😉
Great performance from Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Bullied them all game, Raskin  and Cantwell top players, other mob are raging, happy days.🫡
Fashion was outstanding 🙌🙌💪💪🇿🇲🇿🇲
Sakala is actually coming good now under Micheal Beale his decision making is much better 2 assists and a goal plus he doesn’t just sky the ball over the bar after getting into a good position anymore and could have had 2 or 3 last night, Cantwell looks to have a wee bit of extra class needed sometimes too and looks like a good addition
The pride of Zambia 🇿🇲 fashion sakala 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Jeezy peeps
I can't believe Tavernier got another penalty. No, actually I can.
How many times has var helped us this season, certainly must be a 2 to 1 ratio. Shows what we all knew.
Not a single failure in a blue shirt in the game, I just wish Kent could learn how to shoot.  Ryan Jack immense.
Those Hibs players are assholes, didn't even thank Goldson for the goal!  Jokes aside, good performance but our set piece defending was dire.
Our boy fashion had a good game Zambia 🇿🇲
Sakala in the box when the penalty was taken?
very happy with the teams performance in Edinburgh 😁
Says a lot that the default position and mental strength of Ryan Kent is,to stretch out a leg to win a penalty rather than try to stay on his feet   and score from 3 yards out
Goldson not very good with his feet is he? Great shot stopper/safe pair of hands but you need to be able to use your feet as a modern goalkeeper.
Penalty fc playing to maintain second spot  "Looking down on the rangers"
Fashion had a great game as well. Two assists and a goal. ❤️😍
Fashion Sakala 🇿🇲
"Rangers penalty" seems to be the common shout these days 🤣🤣
Why is NOBODY talking about FASHION SAKALA
If you bet Rangers will get a penalty in every game you'd be rich.
3 things that are certain, Death, Taxes and a Rangers penalty!
Jesus😂 Kent obviously being trained on how to win penalties by the same person Sakala is - “just stand on the opponent’s leg and go down”!  Definitely the second best team in Scotland though so fair play 😂 mind the gap penalty FC👍👋
Raskin and Cantwell will stroll this league
Good seeing colak getting back to form
how terrible must hibs be to concede 4 to the 3rd best team in the country, there are levels to this league
Back in your boxes spoonburners
How did we get cantwell ? Hes a fantastic player
The Gers win again, despite another anti-Rangers ref.  Rule Britannia !
rangers fighting for second place.
Glory, Glory the one, the only, Ron J. Gordon (1954-2023) may you always be a hibee💚💚
the famous rfc
PENALTY TO RANGERS!!😂 Still streets behind the Hoops!!Thank god the League isn't won on Dodgy penalties!✊💚🍀
Jack was outstanding
Royal Rampant Rangers 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
David Marshall some keeper 😂😂😭
We own hearts and hibs  191 league wins over hearts 188 league wins over hibs
SAKALAAAAAA
Fantastic.🥰❤️‍🔥
New contract for Jack if he keeps playing like that.
1st
