What's funny is I was a LA county deputy sheriff for 27 years and my brother has been in and out of prison for years he's my older brother and one day he called me and I brought him to my house bottom clothes did everything I could to try to get him back up on his feet and I told him go and see your kids or grandkids and your ex-wife you could always stay with me yeah most likely the sheriff's department is not going to like it or anybody else but you're my blood after 6 months I found out that he was using you don't want to be around this kids and he told a couple of his homeboys about me and that I had a whole bunch of weapons but they're only county issue weapons I didn't throw them out what I did since he was from another father I just send them to the state that his dad was in and I told him when you grow up and you find God in your heart and you love your children and you have respect for me not as long enforcement but as your brother then you're most likely welcome in my house while the sad thing was he passed on due to drug overdose but I love his kids since I didn't have no kids I have a daughter but she doesn't talk to me and to this day there's nothing I can do with for their kids I do everything I can possibly for his kids and for him too I got him the best funeral that he could have and to this date I tell a lot of people screw the tough guy stuff think about your kids and your family that tough guy is the person that stands by his family and takes care of his family love your family the gang membership is going to go and come
Living with people is good , I live with my boyfriend and it’s just us . So when he at work and out I’m by myself and it gets really lonely. You should tell their mom
Omg, I love JJ’s hair!  My son also has long hair and it has always made him stand out from the rest. ❤️
Evi looks just like your mom 🥰
I feel him I can not live with my mom no more 🤣
People just need to teach there kids to be nice instead of bully 😫 I love his hair
Chiquado? not the way!!! Lol I understand if a girl but boys its a naw!!!
Why dnt u cut his hair ?
Well cut his hair tbh he does look like a girl
Awww he’s so cute! I love how confident Jj is!! He says just stay strong and don’t let anyone bully you!
It’s the fact that she said VLOG and not V-log, Ramiro is changing her in a good way. She seems wiser. I love them together.
Those are her kids the 2 boys ?
YES to you mentioning making makeup videos again 💄✨
I don’t think Ramiro is tired of Britt nor is he toxic y’all is wild. But I do think he might not enjoy doing all the girl things us girls like to do. I feel like she should get together with her sister or mom and do those girls shopping stuff cuz honestly I don’t think any guy cares about furniture or decor.
Moe needs to get her own place next independence is one of the greatest gift of life
i just started watching you guys & i’m in love with how involved you make your children feel & how supportive you are in their decisions. It makes me want to be a mom so bad 😍
You are so pretty
You were a Teen Mom you took care of both of your kids beautifully you still do don't ever get down on yourself you're a good mom
😂😂😂😂😂😂
HELLO  R n B Fam I THINK YOUR SON LOOKS HANDSOME WITH LONG HAIR.  CAN YOU PLZ DO AN UPDATE VIDEO ON HIS EXPERIENCE AT HIS NEW SCHOOL PLZ. THANK YOU. MUCH LOVE ANGIE V ❤️
Bri what lip combo is this?
Why you block me on Instagram just cause I suggested to actually moisturize and style your son hair and it’ll look way better ? 😂😂😂
Jj really sold his mom😂😂that was me as a kid to my stepdad 😂🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
JJ betting mom's kisses 🤣🤣🥰🥰
Is it just me or Ramiro was kind of weird like a different vibe?🤔
Love how you said "we need a living room for the whole family" You always take into consideration your fam, I feel like i'm the same way!
Lowkey feel like ram & their dad have beef. He doesn’t seem bothered that he’s gone
Honestly it's your fault for involving him in your business deals. I don't agree with him being part of your YouTube channel. Yal are not even married. What are u doing? 🤷 All I'm saying is that you're giving him way to much of your time when he's obviously not doing the same for you. 🤷. You're also fluffing up his little ego too much. Why is he mentioning that he don't have kids and you do ?. That u have a baby daddy etc . Ramiro is drifting away. I can see little red flags. Like him saying that he needs to leave for days and days and days and that he gets too lazy to drive back and see u. Like WTF. Just me trying to give u a heads up 🤷
Dude Ramiro is 100 percent my husband “white in our house is a death sentence” 🤣🤣 shit has me dying
$kaedonate 😊
U could've asked for a bus stop that u could've drove to thats what I do because I went to 4/5 different schools a year and I don't want that for my babies so I drive them to their bus stops
My daughter was being bullied by a boy I reported to school and school boared went to the teachers ext and guess what they didn't do nothing about it so I took my kids to self defense classes cz my kids are so loving so humble so sweet they don't understand bullying I always tell my kids to not ever be afraid and protect those that can't help them selfs long story short my daughter handled it and ain't been pulled since🙏🏼❤️
I believe we as parents need to teach our kids that not everyone is the same. If ur kid comes home and tells u oh theirs a boy with long hair. we as parents sit and talk to them and tell them to be kind that boys can have long hair. Girls cud have short hair and etc. And ppl pls teach ur kids to be kind and not bully and accept all the kids the way they look such as dwarfism or kids that don’t dress with fanny clothes 🙏🏼
Jayden is so cute! Very strong little boy! ✨🙏🏻✨
$PrincessRuby93
Forgot to paint window
Poor boy
Why don't u just cut his hair
He’s like oh like he didn’t know that could be an issue awe
Jeeeze Ramiro is negative
Kids are MEAN . Never been bullied more in my life than in elementary school 🤣 couldn’t pay me to do that again
Love having my mom and grandma live with us , they help cook clean .Haha damn Ramiro picky af . Good luck tryna decorate .
Jayden is such a sweet kid giving advice to other kids and Evi is so cute! Can't wait for you and Ram to have a blessing of your own. God bless your beautiful family ❤️
Her man is so negative....She needs to MoveOn but again that’s her choice she obviously see some good in him. He come across as a jerk always trying to contradict what she is saying and you never see him having a great relationship with her own two children. She has such a beautiful attitude and has too much going for herself to be with the Blank head like him.
did y'all ever get the house fixed ?? or maybe I'm late
Britt is so dam annoying 🤯 Ramiro you are a real one for putting up with that
$melaaaanie1 wish you guys the bessst!
Window shopping is the best 🤣 $5cpns
What happen to Benji and mama? We miss the dogs. 🥺
Looks great! It's so enduring to see how well Evi bonds with Ramiro. I'm sure Fern and Bri appreciate it.
A furnished house tour! Love seeing both twins decorate 🤍😁 I just know when JJs older he will be thriving and grow to not care what others think bc you teach him about bullies. 🤎🤎🤎 $jessicalizethx
I always teach my daughter. If a girl has short hair, that's her choice. If a boy has long hair. That's his choice. If a girl doesn't like nail polish, that's her choice. If a boy likes to use nail polish, that's his choice. I have thought her that everyone is different, no one is exactly the same. Parents that let their kids bully, are bully themselves. 🤨   You're doing an amazing job with your boys 💙
JJ is such a cute and smart boy. He'll be alright Britt he got this!
Even having your parents for a couple days , weeks ect when they leave if feels like something is missing that’s how I am with my dad too we have a really good bond and my girls love him it’s nice having him around just making memories family is always first 💖
That school does sound cool wish we has one here in Hawaii 😍
My youngest son has long hair too. He just started kindergarten and whenever he tells me he's ready to cut it I will. For now he likes it like that and we've never cut his hair yet at all. I love Jayden's hair💚
The way he runs and embraces Ramiro 🥺😭
I don’t like the energy in the house Brit 😕
from the bay and now in fresno where can ifind the good mexican restaurants cuz inever get good luck trying places
U guys bought all ur moms furniture. U guys are always spoiling and taking care of her. I love it
He’s such a good man and dad sucks that he wast able to raise brianas kids. Am sure he wants to be a dad
Yesss Brit! Preparing Jayden prior to can help 🙌🏼 that’ll prepare him not to be shocked that there’s mean kids out there. $RRVintage
I love how y’all want everyone together ❤️ and nobody gets bothered by that $RRVintage
Ramiro don’t like em 😭😳
You're house is pretty love you guys!
Los amo 🙌😇😇😇😇🙌 $MichelleAvila915
Brit honestly you’re such a great mom and it’s so apparent how much you love your babies. I understand the anxiety you feel not wanting your baby to get bullied but JJ got this.. I’m so happy you let him know you have his back and that he’s perfect just how he is. God bless you and your family!!
$lexxymonique
JJ has a beautiful soul, he’s so empathetic about others. Your doing amazing Britt remember our kids are our future teaching them to love themselves and having that self esteem will help them in so much ways, it’s a beautiful bond what Ramiro and jj have having a father figure in the home it’s always a plus especially when they see how much rams loves britt :) god is good 😊$ Akb227
You should take the boys to Santa Monica! They get to see that HELLO you guys live in CALI & a TON of guys keep their hair long. It’s my favorite beach since there’s so much to do especially near the pier. My daughters loved the gymnastics playground they have too they just have so much to do there lol.   $Mayraaaa31
Fatimavargasloera  ❤️❤️
Evi running to Ramiro has to the cutest thing ever !! Omg my heart 🥺❤️
Ramiro is such a dream! Good with kids, accept Brittanys kids and treat them like his own. He is outspoken and puts Brittany in her place, when needed. He is super handy around the house and just a working man when you need him. He cooks and treats Brittany like a Queen!   I wish you guys nothing but the best because Brittany you deserve it and he deserves you. I hope you treat him great as well Brittany!   ❤️❤️
My Boys had long hair my little one never had a hair cut until he started pre k he wanted it cut bc they were calling him a girl no matter what we told him it was his choice and it made me so sad he loved his hair but was just more comfortable with cutting it since he hated the kids calling him a girl, kids can be so mean normalize boys with long hair! CA: $xowoo2
Ramiro is such a good man… the way he treats the kids is so heartwarming. The day he becomes a daddy will be such a blessing ❤️❤️❤️😍
Omg I just bought your guys makeup entire kit & I love it but it didn’t come with the bag 🤷🏻‍♀️🥺
Ramiro looks un happy and mad/annoyed all the time! I think he is getting tierd of same old stuff 🤷 you can definitely tell how dosent she see that
Why doesn’t she cut his hair? Sorry I’m new here don’t know much about her kids
How lucky that evi has a great tio like they must feel so blessed that ram is this great! And just imagine when he becomes a dad for the first time omfg!!!!!! Have a baby!
17:33 oh my gosh, so heart warming. ❤️ Romario and you are so supportive of him and it makes him confident. I hated growing up, kids are mean. & I know that they are truly most likely not trying to hurt feelings but it happens. Your lookin like a surfer JJ, and the kids appreciate your advice. Shoot 4 the stars and don’t look back. The universe is yours and you are so loved for the boy you are, and the man you will become. 🤍God Bless you and yourz baby girl, xoxo ❤️
Puras chismosas. You guys don't know What happens off camera. Britt would've ended things if she felt that he treated her bad. Here comes the people saying "I've been saying I don't like Ramiro and this and that". Such miserable people. She already cleared up that Ramiro’s comment about not caring if britts dad moved out or not wasn’t meant in a rude way.
Kids are so mean now days.I volunteered while my kids when to school kindergarten up to 4th grade and during recess teachers don’t watch their students they’re on recess too in the teachers break room.There was always one yard duty person watching over 100 kids .So I would go out to the playground and let me tell you there are some mean bullies out there!Boys would call other little boys the f word or you’re gay you look like a girl etc.Believe me I would have some words with that kid and I would have to tell the teachers and teachers would confront that kid and off to the principal office they would go and don’t let me get started with the girl bullies lol!So I’m glad you’re aware of that.
Awe Brit you look and sound so sad about your dad moving out I’m so sorry, remember things happen for a reason and God puts us all in certain places at the right times for he only knows what’s best!! Keep your head up and keep doing you and your family!! Your dad can still visit at least and loves you guys very much!! I wish I could give you a hug but for now I’m sending you positive vibes and a hug via YouTube comments lol 🥰🤗❤️❤️ $annvigil79
I think you moved to my area, I love that little cantina Luxe 😍
Absolutely love you guys! Since day one! $jessica1oo
🌹🤗🥰🥰 $SANDWEN
I literally cried seeing Evi's reaction to reuniting with Ramiro 🥲🥰 I have two kids and they don't have relationships like this with their aunt/uncles 😭
Ruben left the nest 🐣😖
I have a question britt. I know you kept J’s hair long as a younger child and you got him used to it. But did you ever think about him getting bullied? How come you never cut it short when he was smaller? No hate like I’m just curious lol idk how I would feel about my son getting bullied all because I let my sons hair get long and never cut it. Like I would feel it was my fault. There’s nothing wrong with boys having long hair but kids can be so cruel 😩
His hair is beautiful!
Moe needs to get her own place she’s like 30 something!!!???
$cgalvan12 hope i can win! love your video and seeing you and Ramiro getting along. Also love your kids.
I have those same light couches! Just bought them a month ago and my one year old son already got them dirty, stained them with RED kool aid 😭😭😭 but lucky these couches are soo easy to clean and just with a carpet cleaner and a rag it came off. I fell in love with these big light couches & still in love !
We love you guys ❤️❤️
$Gallardojoseph
Evi loves you guys so much.. when a child is treated with love and respect this is how they react to you’re presence. 🙏❤️
Hi Britt I get ur concerned about moving ur kids because it’s not fun being the new kid and some kids can just be mean but good thing ur boys seem like good kids and won’t have trouble making friends but for them it’s definitely an adjustment but they are young . So when ur ready to buy a house make sure you research the school district … that’s important 😊
dude my dad use to do that shit to me and my Siblings take us Furniture shopping & We pick what we wanted and he would say i’ll get it for your birthday and never get it 😂😂 that’s when i knew i had trust issues 😂 & it was always that furniture store here in fresno mor 😂 $aylinalvarez1031
Love you guys💖 !!! @seniaaa1997 🤞🏼
We wish we can keep our loved ones so close but God has a path for us all. I know I wish to be so close to my parents but life is life $lovelykatx  Btw I always make sure to watch you and brits ads. Full support
Girl cut his hair so he don’t have to go through that , your the parent not him
The way Evie pats Ramiro on the back 😢💙
you can get the kids an out of district referral so they can still go to the same school <3 $soniarc1
$kathynavarrete
🥲 JJ is so cool! I love his hair! My 4 yr old son has long hair & strangers constantly confuse him for a girl.. but in reality, he is complimented on it A LOT! And the most important thing is that he likes it 🥰 I ask him if he wants it up & he'll tell me NO, he likes it down & wild.. just like his Dad's 😅  But I am nervous for what he's gonna deal with at school next year, kids can be so mean! 😔
Do both unfurnished & furnish
Britt makeup on point
RAMIRO: your pimping mom out to me 😂 I LMFAO 😂
$itzelhhmm i love yal 🤍

$dollydoll707   Love y’all
Walked my butt inside the furniture store acting like I'm really buying furniture for my home😆😭but nooo I'm jst hea to walk/look around w/ my broke-ass💀....  ........ opps sorry worker didn't mean to waste ur time🥴. $Kainar04
I’m so happy you accept your dad’s decision of moving out the house, it just shows how of a strong and humble women you are by just simply letting him live his life, even though you probably won’t see him often ❤️❤️ $Jaacss
I loved track school way better than traditional .
For all of those commenting negatively on ramiros attitude & how he’s been been “shady”.  My man is a air sign & a libra as well and he & Ramiro have many similarities. Libras tend to shy away from cameras & tend to be the complete opposite of social. They might seem grouchy or rude but their intentions are always to protect & be reserved….Remember he’s adjusting to dating someone who’s life is so public ( always on camera ) & not everyone has to be the same! Much love & positivity ❤️❤️
“We’ve always had kids bro”   😂😂 $karenmparedes
does anyone know why he was in prison ?
Agh the part about bullying made me cry 🥺🥺🥺 it breaks my heart so see kids be rude with each other in class// can’t wait to see the house tour!! Show us now before all the furniture so we can see the changes with y’all!! // $kiki963
Chino you no
As long as you guys always stay in touch and visit more often, eventually you guys are gonna move too and moe too but you guys are a very close family and always hang out and do family trips/vacations 💙💙💙 we will miss your dad in the blog thought he and your mom are funny and your oldest son looks exactly like your dad  $lyssarachellep

I have a feeling when y’all get pregnant, you guys are going to have a baby girl. I can’t wait to see it happen 🥰. $theeonlygenesis
she’s pregnant lol “we have kids now” 👀
I can tell there’s tension and you seem stressed I know the feeling sorry you’re going through it ! 😓
I love evi and ram rams bond it’s so adorable 😭❤️
Love you Brit❤️❤️❤️ $danimelisssa
I hate the rumors going around about your parents that are allegedly spread by maribel. F her & she seems like the type
Your such an amazing MOM. #Stay strong # Don’t let anyone bully you.!!!! AMEN you got this JJ. ♥️ your doing amazing job $Pedraza04
I was see your baby with braids
$xxxmarixo
I'm glad for your dad to be living his best life! As long as he keeps in touch that's all that matters. 💕 I agree with you about bullying the issue is these parents don't have the time to talk to their kids sadly it's just a domino effect. For JJ just teach him to be strong & be true to himself & what he wants. 🥰  $chels912
Ramiro is an ass! He gives off a bad vibe. Like he’s always irritable.
I did track school my whole elementary I loved it
JJ is such a sweetheart, that little man is going to go places. The fact that he still has his long hair even though people use to/do bully him says a lot, I hope no one EVER makes him feel like he has to cut it! How could anyone bully him, makes me so sad. I’m currently growing out my sons hair as well, he’s 2 years old and already people call him a girl. Boys with long hair are angels sent from heaven ❤️  $LidiaFigueroa
The way Ramiro gave JJ the assurance that he is rocking the surfer look was beautiful. He really loves the kids as if they were his. He didn’t want JJ stressing over school telling Brit they still have a month. Yet I understand Brit as a mom too🥰she just wants to prepare her son for what might come. She’s protective and I get where she’s coming from.❤️ These kids are in such good hands it’s really good to see how well you guys are raising your kids. I can’t wait till you guys grow the family. 😍
Love his long hair 💙 $AlvarezSh
To me it seems like Ramiro is just over it with Brit lack of intelligence and her being selfish and not letting him spend time with his family or doing other stuff.
can you do two vlogs, one as us with how the house is now and another one with new furniture
You should put curtains to cover up the brown blinds.
JJ: Jesus had long hair! 💪🏼🇲🇽
$509mari love yall
If you only show us the furnished house that’s only 1 video. Show us unfurnished and furnished so we get the bonus video! 😃 so proud of and happy for you guys!! 🤗❤️🙏🏼😘🌹🇲🇽
$jackelenperez 🤞🏻☺️ keep your head up queen , love you guys!
I got emotional when you were talking about your dad 😞I lost mine when I was 11 so it touched my heart ❤️🥺no matter what always make sure y’all still get together and talk and take care of each other because family is family and they always come first , i miss my dad everyday so please stay close to yours 🥺❤️❤️❤️I love y’all 🥰 $jnvms
That moment she said, “we have kids now” and then looked at Ramiro she’s pregnant
It’s ok pops moving out everyone needs their space..just hope no one is whispering in his ear… love you and all the fam.  What’s with all the hate comments against Ramiro .. much love to you all😍😊 $marzluna
I get so excited when you guys upload lol i love yours & Ramiros vibe! I would looove a house tour now only because i’m so impatient lol, but a furnished house tour would be better 🥰 I hope you & your little fam are happy in your new home! Congrats again on alll your accomplishments & all of the upcoming successes also 💕 You’ve always remained so sweet & humble , you deserve nothing but the best! Cheers to your new home filled with new memories surrounded by your loved ones! 🥂 $tephh361

I felt like this really hurt her the move with her dad
The chisme report gave us the tea , you’re dad use to hit and abused you’re mom 🙄
I always See you and Ramiro purchasing house items do you guys pay for everything? Just curious  $momwhoslayss
Everyone always goes their separate ways girl but at the end of the day family will always be first you and your family remind me of mine so much we are always together no matter what through thick and thin ❤️ $Karrot96
I think your dad moved out bc your bf is a smart ass.
You’re such a awesome mommy Brit and Ramiro is such a awesome step daddy love the way you both give JJ the pep talk getting him ready for school JJ is so confident and that’s awesome 👏 Rock your long hair JJ if you love it that’s all that matters 💕$christina010903
@Irma-Rodriguez I’m going to miss watching him in your videos and calling you baby girl 😭
Absolutely ❤️ your vlogs! Keep them coming LOL!  Ramiro haha better then me going to visit baby mama look at the positive side!!! 😂
I swear the boys crack me up! All that matters is that he feels comfortable now and is strong enough to say that! Super proud of your guys growth! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ $YessicaIxC
Aww Ramiro is so sweet to Evi 🥴  💓
I agree it was a bit rude how Ramiro expressed the way he felt about Ruben moving out… I feel like he could’ve said anything else but what he said .. and the fact that he’s kind of rude to Brit sometimes..but he’s a good dad and a good man overall I guess
Everything sure does happen for a reason ☝🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 $Shadayra
$cynthiax0614 !!! I love u guys
My absolute FAVORITE part of the video is… “STAY STRONG” my heart exploded 🥰👍🏼🥰

There’s  a plan boo! For everyone his bless l
I remember when I had to move to a different school that was the worst but I hope the kids meet new friends and love their new school 🥰 $cindybabbyy

So many negative comments about Ramiro, and I've been seeing similar comments about fern too , people can't judge them on 30 min videos lol .the twins can be blondes but I know damn well they wldnt be in a negative relationship & plus alotta Mexican men are like that lol blunt and be lookin real serious ,as far as the boys that breaks my heart ,I dislike mean kids.

$teresapinedac love you guys!
Ramiro when JJ said he wants to be a surfer: well you got the right look going on Bud. 🥰😂😂😂
Awwwwwh I’m glad you got to rekindle your relationship with your father since he wasn’t around much in the past. But like you said everyone has to figure out there own life. I hope he comes around often still. I can tell you And Bri really love having family around. ❤️ $destinytrinh13
Brit I feel u with the pops situation like he gets out and it' was good for a Lil and time Flys and then he makes his own life and hardly sees us.. I thought we would be closer when he came home but it wasn't  we are more distant Miles apart then he was in prison
$xomelll97  you guys are my favorite 😢❤️
When the kids ask jj if he’s a girl or a boy he should tell them to mind they own !! haha but he should tell them i’m a boy and aqua mans a boy too and he has long hair. That’s what we told my little nephew to tell kids whenever they ask him what he is since he has long hair too.

You’re dad did the right thing. I find it weird to move all together. There’s a difference moving in with parents for any reason or you’re father staying with you temporarily but you have you’re family you need space more so when you have a partner.

Love you guys, you guys are so humble and change is always hard. $BreatizAquallo
Moe needs to move out honestly lol your in a whole relationship with kids, she needs ta find her own way.
Your very lucky to have met Ramiro.  I never had good feelings for that other boyfriend you had.  I was watching your old videos (delete him), he's creepy. Sorry.  I love your videos.
Ok trending 🤪
A few comments saying how pops leaving is weird or wtvr tf but like he hasn’t been in the free to figure himself out, he’s not the guy he was before & it’s a whole new world for him to explore.. I highly doubt he’d ever forget his baby girls & his boys (grandkids) 👏🏼 best of luck on both journeys, his & urs 💖
All I have to say is you guys are great parents my respect to you Ramiro for what you do , when I saw you playing with j I was so happy to see how he feels so comfortable with you ❤️ this is beautiful ! And the way evi loves you I can’t wait to see you guys with your kids ❤️  I’m so happy for you guys !   $ashleyramales
I remember the vlog of Jj crying wanting to cut his hair because they were bullying him. I cried for him and you. Breaks my heart when children aren’t taught to be kind. It’s hair it’s not abnormal for men to have long hair. And even if someone is different why does it bother you?? Ya know?
In this life that we’re living sometimes all we need is our parents. Times can be tough where we just need their comfort, AINT nothing like that family bond🤍  But glad to c y’all are always good terms no matter what. Positive vibes girl.  Much love from Fresno 😌💖   $BeeMarie92

I hope ramiro gets to be evis padrino ❤️❤️
“I want to be a surfer” 🏄🏻‍♂️ 🥺🥺 my heart!!! Yes he has the perfect look 😍🥰🥰🥰 you should probably look into putting him into surfing classes that would be dope you never know watch JayJay become a pro never doubt it!!
i love his long hair BUT it NEEDS to be brushed and parted or pulled out of his face. it looks sloppy how it is... and thats not right for a kid to be like that. sorry :/
Ramiro appreciate your girl ! Beautiful Family ❤️

Nah we need the semi- empty house tour! 🙌🏼😂 and then it’ll be a before and after. ☺️  And ima need your landlord to just let y’all do what you want after all the mess moving in !
How you parent the boys is so amazing. You are just the sweetest mom to them & it really shows🥰🙏🏼❤️
Hearing about Jj’s experience makes me so sad. I have a son with long hair who is 4 yrs old and he constantly gets called a girl. People say, “oh what a pretty girl”, “she”, it makes me angry and I correct them. My daughter has been told why does her brother have long hair like a girl. It worries me for when he starts school. My son is a sensitive little guy. 😥💔
I love how you worry about your kids. You’re an amazing mother! ❤️❤️ I moved a lot from schools and it wasn’t that bad. $lizzierei
Kids are so mean these days. My 9yo nephew also gets bullied sometimes because of his long hair, talking about he’s a girl :(
A before and after house tour
Back when we were younger in elementary, my brother used to have long hair and other kids would say he was a girl. My mom talked to the principal but he did nothing. The next time those kids came for my brother, he pulled down his pants and showed them he wasn’t a girl. The principal tried to suspend my brother, but my mom told the principal that she came and talked to him and he did nothing to stop those kids . She said that if he got in trouble for standing up for himself , she would go speak to the school board. The principal didn’t suspend him and that was the last time those kids messed with my brother. JJ’s hair is beautiful. I’m sorry he has to go through that. But I do advice you to speak to the principal or even the school board if  necessary because bullying should not be tolerated.
I love you bri 🤩✨🥰 I always watch your videos every time you post I liked & subscribed 🥰

Why does moe still lives with you guys ? I agree with Ramiro I couldn’t live with other people especially if I’m in a relationship
Awww of course I'm here for the gossip🤷🏻‍♀️🤗 no but really it's good for everybody to have their own space I really do hope he makes that effort for you bri and all the kids. You're a strong mama your kids being bullied is the hardest thing ever cause you can't go around beating up other moms for what their kids say just saying but really it's so hard and also a teachable moment for everyone involved. 🙏 For a easy transition to a new school for your babies 🥰 $Cmiyeko
Your house is going to look so beautiful with all the furniture you buy, and JJs hair suits him so well she should not have to deal with anyone making comments about it! You are a good mommy for talking to him! ❤️ $soniasg01
Please post more!! ☺️ love your family channel videos! ❤️ $SAMSPANKY
Brit: "We have kids now" Lol wait what?? Ramiro has kids now. Lmao
Brit please do a unfurnished home tour 😍😍😍 !! Love the transformation of you’re beauty room. $Cecy98
Ramiro is such a smart ass I can’t lol. $elenamariahh
I always have the same problem with my son, kids just have no filter maybe letting the teacher know so they can speak about the topic. $kchavez28
I just don’t like how Ramiro is 🤦🏻‍♀️
I know how hard it is to see loved ones want to move on but change is always good. Especially when you are trying to focus on yourself❤️ i love how humble you guys are cant wait for kore upcoming videos🙌🏼 $DaniielaVC
i thought they lived in sac??
Love the positive messages for the kids out there with long hair 🥰🥰  Keep up the positive teaching loveeeitt☺️☺️ $Myaaaa9
Track schools are dope, I went to one for my high school and I loved having 2-3 months of school then having 3 weeks off ! Then summer was like a month and a half or two months ! And honestly it’s the parents who need to teach there kids that having long hair is gender neutral!!!!
I loved the way it sounded when you said we’re a family now que bonito 😍
I love you guys so much.  I am just going to bawl my eyes out once you and ram have a baby ♡ such genuine, real people.
Boys with long hair is something natives represent traditionally and it is respected! Boys and men grow their hair to signify their strength and is considered sacred in a way. Jayden is handsome with his long hair. Do you have a PO Box? Because I can send a shirt that's cute that we see little boys wear that lets people know he is a boy no matter the length of his hair haha I cant remember the exact lettering but its somewhere those lines haha 💕 $cantso266
Some kids can be so mean! I’m glad jj knows that having long hair is ok for a boy! Love you guys sm!💖💖 $deniset003
I love y’all !❤️❤️ $shorty9166
Aww Jayden ❤️❤️
Love the vlogs!! $EstefanySolorzano

y’all are so humble and I love it and I can tell youu guys are but I love y’all’s family!! Cant wait to see y’all grow!  $gabyhernandez1
Seeing Ramiro as a stepdad and how he is w the kids makes me so happy 💖 your babies deserve the very best treatment from the world ❤️
$MerihildaFelix
Omg Ramiro is a great step parent, I love how he encourages jj to be strong and not let anyone bully him into cutting his hair.
I hope all goes well with you guys and your new home & for you dad as well ❤️ $Jaylinemq
Poor JayJay 😟 perhaps you can convince him to cut it shoulder length?
If it's giving so much bullying to him why not just cut his hair? I know it's your choice and we shouldn't do things for other ppl but at the same time if he is constantly going thru bullying then it's sad I hate when stupid kids bully others.and as a kid u feel so bad going every day to school and having to go thru that😞💜
Now it’s just moe’s turn lol
Awh you guys are so good with Evi 🤍✨ can't wait until you start growing your family 😁🤞❤️ $lifeofDandyDeee

You should do a before and after furniture tour. $featheredcurtains
Not telling you what to do because your his mom and you know whats best for them but you should def let the teacher and principal know whats going on so they can speak on that topic to all the kids at school because you dont want your baby feeling that way at school.
Honestly I love how Ramiro is with the boys !! ❤️❤️
Lol JJ is so cute!!! Rams added more kisses and he said sureee 😂😂 lmfao he is adorable Protect his precious heart ❤️ He is lucky to have siah to protect him and stand up for him! Love the boys and your fam😘

In some cultures, Long hair on males represents strength. Disregard the petty behavior of ignorant kids. Kids will be kids, even if they're bleep bleep.
$aunaBabeXoXo
Britt its so sad to see everyone going their own ways, but it really is the best. I still remember back in Sac when everyone was living together the videos were so much fun 😂 but thats how people grow and everyone lives close together so the bond can still be there!  $tephaniezamudio
Good luck to your dad n to your beautiful family also ... prayers...   $aunaBabeXoXo
Do a tour with and with out! Please
Ramiro is looking like a grouch. 😂
Love watching you guys grow over the past 2 years that I have been watching. You and your family inspire me to reach the goals that i have and change can be difficult but a blessing at the same time so think of as a blessing for your dad and your family. You got this and a year from now you'll look back and see how much growth and happiness will happen. THAT just gives your family another reason to throw more carne asadas to have family time. Much love 💗 #GOALS $SarahMC94
I love the fact the JJ still doesn’t cut his hair regardless of what the kids say!! I know it hurts you baby boy but you’re so strong!!👏🏼👏🏼💪🏼💙 $vaaleerieexo
Who does moe stay with anyone know??
The fact that your parents and Ramiro’s parents were completely opposite as in, your parent’s were more strict and in your business and his were laid back. But you both turned out to be very well raised show’s parents don’t always have to be strict for they’re child to turn out well mannered and big hearted and humble. $kittykat3117
I just want to let you know that you are an amazing mother❣️  $AlexandraaEscamilla

The boys will make new friends soon, they will adapt fast👍🏼 $xoxofelina
Girll kids this days are savage 😭 my babyboy just started wearing glasses and its so conscious but we always encourage him to not care what anyone says or thinks but always but it all starts at home teaching our boys to always defend themselves and to never make fun of no one no matter how they look we are all the same at the end JJ is such a sweet soul i wish i can just give him a big hug🥰🥰 You are a great mom Brit❤️ $SomozaFamily
why did my eyes water when you said they call him a girl 😭 I talked to my daughter when she started school that every kid is different and she has to be nice to people breaks my heart !!!! I hate mean kids
$Xoxofelina
My son didn’t know boys could have long hair when he was in Pre-k last yr he said there was a boy with long hair &  it was for girls only & It was my mistake not talking to him about boys having long hair as well and I talked to him through it and one day he ended up defending the same little boy with long hair in his class 🥺❤️he came home telling me “ mommy I told another little boy to leave Jesus alone because boy he is not a girl he’s a boy”
Awesome I'm sad I'm gonna miss your dad  I hope he can still come out on the vlogs
Evi is so cute!! 😍
I love how Siah defends his brother! ❤️
Love you guys !! $stephanie12210

Girl it’s crazy because all the Kids in my son’s schools have long hair .. kids over here get bullied for having short hair .. I guess it depends where you live what kids are used to seeing more . I lived in a beach city before so all kids beach boy long hair and now I’m in IE on the lake side so now it’s like country vibes and all have long hair. I hope kids are nicer at his new school 🤍🤍🤍
Aww I hope you and your dad are still able to chill.  He has he's own life and maybe he wants to try and grow alone wit he's girl or whoever.  But I hope the best 4 you and your pops. I'm a daddy girl I'll be sad without my dad  I'm so  close 2 my dad. So I feel you girl. 💙🙏💫 awe I hope they don't pick on your son that's sad . Kids are bully sometimes.  I feel your worry. Do you think your ever gonna cut he's hair?? When he's ready.?? And your food looks bomb af 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 and love your nails💜💅 that's sweet of beauty bird getting your boys a gift for Christmas. Your son is so sweet and cute he brave and smart young man. All made emotional idk why it did I hope he has a good days at school. 🙂 $Lashes210
You should just do his hair in a man bun instead of having it down its better for him to so he won't have his hair in his face. Kids don't know or their just acting dumb and mean to him for having long hair that is very common don't they see surfer dudes they have long hair lol $monicaxo26
JJ is so adorable! He’s growing into his confidence and it’s so nice to watch….💜 $BellaGem10
Jj is getting big
Your a great mom to be teaching your kid to always be strong and not let anyone make him feel less ❤ good job jayden💪 $pelayojen

Once somebody sees something they don’t like about Ramiro he suddenly turns into a horrible person and not meant for Brit. That’s ridiculous not everyone is perfect he’s allowed to have his own opinions.
Idk but ramiros attitude came out to strong idk if it’s just me 🤷🏻‍♀️
I feel the same way with moving and having to switch my daughters school I'm actually in this situation right now I'm trying to find somewhere close to her school but so far no luck. As far as bullying my daughter receives food bags from school and one time these boys were telling her she's poor because she gets food bags, my daughter came off the bus so sad and embarrassed 🤬. But yea we also have a moors out here in Seattle too!
Omg I love when y’all are Bri upload 😩💓 Keep them coming !!!  $synthiaagomez

Kids are very mean this days ☹️ I truly believe in boosting your kid’s self esteem so high that those comments don’t effect them. It starts at home ❤️ $ceeeceee98
2 months for the couches to come in?  Do a house tour now! You can’t make us wait that long 😫  $Kaytlin1023
I feel like Elementary School is easier for them when it comes to moving because they make friends easily. It would be harder for them if it were middle school or high School.
I can’t wait for the house tour. You should do two one now and another after you furnish it. Love you guys ❤️ $jackiee1009
I think it’s better for you guys to have you own private life and your dad also and your kids are so sweet how can anyone evan fight with them 🥺 $Alondracalleros
Love you guys $angeljnani blessings
New sub here 🤍 Brittney you are so cute lol... your relationship with Ramiro reminds me of mine with my husband! We have been married for more than 10 years now .... i see that you guys are different but its a good thing! You guys balance each other out perfectly well!! I can see your point of views and maybe sometimes you might feel like he might not understand you or is even listening- but he cares .... 🤍🤍 i love watching you guys together 🤍 Saludos desde Arizona Nena 🤩🤩 also btw kids can be so rude now a days!!! Tell your child to tell those kids that Jesus had long hair too... (should help keep there mouths Shut!)
JJ is so adorable, glad he sticks to what he wants even if other kids don’t like it. Continue to encourage him to be his own person. You guys are doing a great job. $sylviag77
Why did my dirty mind think you meant getting laid every time you said Ramiro left before getting his work done😂 $PenelopeServin
I love that you had a talk with jj just to mentally prepare him! Unfortunately only thing we can do is teach our kids how the treat people/others, and hope that other parents do the same ❤️✨ loved the vlog! $lorenhtx

I feel you about Jj situation with his hair with my son 🥺 $LeslieYecennia
Love watching you and your fam!! 💕💕 $jennthao
My guy Ramiro not used to living with his parents? He ain't never lived with his parents, not even as a kid? 🤔
A little boy bullied my son over having the same back pack as him. & the back pack my son had was a backpack I picked up at the store real quick because the back pack I ordered didn’t get delivered in time for the first day. My son came home crying saying he doesn’t wanna use that back pack anymore.  I hugged him & told my son that it’s not his fault. That little boy has his own issues within himself. I had to tell him the little boy was mad at himself and not at my son.  My son began to calm down & understand. I told my son to just be nice to him because he might be going through a hard time at home.  I try to raise him with confidence & love , I instill kindness & understanding into my kids !   JJ is loved & cared for & he needs to know that some people were just not raised the same & a lot of kids are raised with hatefulness & ugliness.  & they self project that onto others. JJ needs to know that he isn’t the problem , the other kids are !  I hope JJ stays being the sweet , kind & confident baby he is. 💕  You’re such a good mommy Brit 🥺❤️❤️❤️ I hope it’s gets better for the boys !    Also I wanna say how awesome you are for letting your dad live with you while he rebuilt himself & his life . I’m actually really proud he stayed on a good path & y’all got to rebuild a relationship with him & now the boys have a good, present grandpa forever ! That’s really admirable. I know my dad just went back to his old life & ended up back in prison several times After already doing 12 years. I wish he would of stepped up & been the parent & grandparent we all deserved & waited for.    God Bless you & your family Brit ! 💕 I stay rooting & praying for y’all 💖💖 Can’t wait to see more 🥰🥰🥰
Painting is such a hassle I have to do the same!! 😑 $Rox3rs
aww JJ wanting to be a surfer is so cute. you should def get him surfing lessons in the summer.
Tell your dad to hit my line! Lol jk please don’t come at me I love you guys 😛💕
Its not the kids fault it’s society’s fault for making everyone think long hair is only for girls so maybe they’re parents think like that too so the kids probably think long hair is only for girls. Jj has beautiful hair💗.
No matter where your pa goes I feel like you guys will always be close , and jj is the sweetest little boy ever 💙💙  $beenaranjo
Your doing an amazing job with ur boys !! ❤️‍🔥
Love You guys !  🥰🥰 I swear I LOVE WATCHING your whole family ❤️!!!  $duranm17

Let him  Have fun ,he’s a good guy , he already helps you alot! We know he loves y’all

JJ is the cutest i love him he is so kind.
It’s cool that Ruben wants to start his own thing but dam hopefully he still comes around he’s barley been in the girls life’s .. he should still keep building a real relationship with his kids and now grandkids he owes them that girlfriend or not but from what I see she’s insecure so idk how that’s gonna work 🤷🏻‍♀️

Aww dude don't think we didn't see when ramiro let jj win 🥰 good shit rams! I love your videos brit keep them coming
I must be about to start my Moon.  My hormones were everywhere in this vlog... To Pops moving out, Ramiros Dad lying to him about bedroom furniture, Watching Ramiro and JJ play together too cute... to Jj's words of encouragement!!! "STAY STRONG" 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😍 - ALL LOVE WITH LOVE! $AngTriCov
Aw! I got happy when I saw y’all uploaded a new YouTube video! I love watching y’all videos!! Y’all so humble!! 🥰❤️.  $ggarcia173
Brit is everything okay with Ramiro? He seemed a bit off and negative in this video. I hope he is doing fine if he is going through something!
I’ve been watching you guys since day 1. Love your family so much. $ErikaMiller2131
Lamo ramiros example know
What’s up w the house show us the house 🏡
can’t wait to see what the future holds for   You, ram and the kids! ❤️ $cxnbxrr
Omg the bond that Ramiro has with your kids is amazing to me love this ❤️ $castillocoral
His hair goes with him it suits him so well. I feel like it's cute and you can even braid him up.theres grown men with longer hair and no one messes with them.just keep telling him to tell them to shut up and mind the business cause he's a boy
The first couch was really nice 🔥 but I would go with the second because it’s bigger and all of you will fit nicely ♥️ $$loveechelseyy
Lmfaooo Rams “I went for 10 yrs & didn’t get shit”
Por Ram he used the roller to paint it’s more work like that. Yall should used the sprayer to paint it’s much easier. They sell it at Home Depot or lows you can even buy the cheaper one it works the same.
Love to see yalls growth as a family and as a channel. It’s really inspiring. Stay blessed✨ $Raemuny
$nicolegarcia23 love you ❤️
$Lorenagz13
Hey friend.❤️🙏🏾✌🏾
Well at lease I don’t have to go visit a baby momma 😂
Just raise your baby to be confident regardless of what other kids or adults think. My baby had long hair in elementary and grew it out again in middle going in to high school and he loves it. $SandeeCustodio
So happy for you that you have Ram to complete your immediate family and your boys have a dad to interact with.  You 4 are the cutest family 👪
time for mow to move now 🤣
Normalize boys having long hair!! Teach your kids to not bully other kids !!  $greysiiii

I just love watching y’all’s videos❤️❤️❤️🥰  $realynn12💚👐
JJ is so Adorable and such a Sweet little boy. I love how he is so confident with his long hair.$Christinakeatts
Is Ramiro tired of Britt? He seems to always have an attitude or a smart comment. Looks really unhappy and annoyed in this video. we know you are a lot more intelligent than Britt but you don’t need to call her out on everything. Hope i’m just reading into it too much…anyone else? Love you Britt.
Fun drinking game idea: take a shot every time Ramiro says “ohh yeahh!” When he’s with Evi😂 $MadeeHolt love u guys thanks for the dose of love and light!
Not jj sellin Brit like that 😂
jj’s words were so mature, he’s so cute 🥰
Jj is the cutest he knows not to listen to the bullies ❤️ $cerina74
$vanessaa7 💕
Girl I feel you… We just bought a  new home and my kids home school goes from k-12 grade. So I have two boys  and I drive a 25 minute drive to drop them off  to their same school . Just so that they can still have their same friends and of course  so they won’t get bullied as well .. Hopefully your kids can get adjusted to their new school and of course talk to their teachers about bullying. $FelisitasSandoval
On a spiritual level they say hair is connected to the soul, spirit, thoughts, feelings, etc; that's why I never cut my hair. I feel like JJ is really self aware for being so young and that's why he never wants to cut his hair. Maybe subconsciously he knows the importance of his hair. I mean it makes sense to me, considering he's so sweet and understanding of his and other peoples feelings. So quiet and timid but I can also tell he has a very nurturing side to him. Its like hes been here before. I love your hair JJ and stand your ground if people think you should cut them 💜 $lovemebrittany
So happy for your dad! Your videos always makes my day and I feel like I’m relating to a sister. $qgonnie13
Aww poor baby you should definitely talk to the teacher  $yandirahh

Your mom did a great job raising you guys by herself, she definetely needs credit for that. Love watching your beautiful family grow!! Love from Chicago❤✌❤ $VitaminA9090
When you were talking to JJ it’s sad that we as parents have to talk to our kids about bullying and how to defend and stand up for themselves 🥺 JJ your hair is beautiful and yes you’re a surfer dude don’t let no one bring you down 🙏🏻💙💙 Brit you’re doing such a good job with the boys 💪🏻
Everything will be ok 💞🙏 $Sofia044
Lmao I can relate to going furniture shopping with my parents as a kid too and we never got what we wanted😅 it’s a Mexican thing I guess😂😂  You guys should try el pescador in ontario on Euclid 🤤 so 🔥.   $Mariil0ve
Why does Ramiro always have a bad attitude or some smartass sarcastic remarks to say? It’s gotten annoying :/
No cashapp just walmart hella serious  Life Is a beautiful struggle moma of 3 handsome boyz
Really bri i dont want to say this but y dose Ramiro have to leave for days hes been doing that from the begining and it feels iffyyyy....lucky him that u trust him hope he has not been taking advantage of you my sixth sense kicks in everytime he leaves  y dosent he take you
I love how y’all are growing together as a family ! 🥺😍 I can’t wait for a house tour ! 🤭 quick question did Ramiro and your pops get along ? Like good good or just like whatever type ?  $mendozaJ66
But how evi ran up was literally the cutest thing ever 😩❤️❤️ $kayla10x10
$DalilahGonzale
We love your dad, wish him the best always 💙 $JOCYMTZ4
It’s never ok to bully poor baby I hope the teacher addresses it. Everyone is different!  $molxda
Your dad seems like more of a friend or brother , he seems like the child and you and Briana are the adults ! Sometimes it be like that
Ramiro run !!!!!!!!!
I like Ramiro's energy. I can tell from the way he speaks, he's going to be an excellent husband for you and great step dad to your boys. He doesn't dwell on what life throws his way and also helps you do the same. You're sad about your dad, but you would have eventually had to move on without him to form your family with Ramiro. Be thankful for the memories you made those couple of years your dad got to live with you and how he got to bond with his grandkids. Your boys will be forever close to him because of that precious time together 🙂✨.   (Just make sure to call him to help keep the bond as close as possible🙏)
Brit I 100% feel your concern for JJ going to a new school & getting bullied about his hair that’s how I feel with my son, he has ptosis in his left eye & im so scared of him getting bullied when it’s time for him to go to school. Kids nowadays are so disrespectful & straight up bullies ! It’s scary as a mom. But I’m happy JJ is so strong minded !! Please if your a parent teach your kids to be kind ❤️
jj needs to understand how beautiful his hair is & how it defines him! I’m glad pops is doing good on his own & continues to have more good things on his way loved the vlog! $kvsvz
U should do an unfurnished house tour and then a full furnished house tour
Yes Mor  Furniture is in Fresno.
Ramiro is going to be the cutest dad aww 🥰
Change is hard but necessary to achieve bigger goals you and your family will only go up from here 💙 $dorali22
hola donde ustedes viven no dan tickets por no traer sinturon de seguridad
So did your dad help you guys move in and pack and then he left🥺
❤️👍🏽🌸
Y’all live in Ontario / Eastvale 😬
Britt your dad probably  felt out of place... you guys had 3 big BBQ and he couldn't  be at any... taking turns one BBQ mom 1 dad would of been fair...He probably feels like you girls have to be put in the middle..so he did the bigger thing and moved.... Hopefully he stays close....
Well damn Ramiro can you be anymore rude 3:07
$heyyyalee
I just thought he had a girlfriend and that's why he wasn't around..Well good for him hope he's happy that's all that matters..And my grandson has way longer hair then your son and he never gets teased (bullied)  You have such good taste in decorating your house 🏠
Maybe it’s good he finds his own way, keep your bond strong. May god bless you all, thanks for always keeping it real and raw. I look up to you! ❤️ your son is soooo cute, I wanna hug him 🥺❤️ $jacquelineee21
You should do a unfurnished house tour and furnished house tour ☺️ $Oakland97
U gurls are always helping the family but..... U really dnt have to they need to get jobs and do their own thing if they were old well thats different u kno like mama thats okay but then the brothers over their too no way they grown and can do it instead he wants to start a channel so he dnt have to work

Evi looked like his momma at 27:41 back in the first vlogs when Bri would give attitude in a funny way
so cute can’t wait for yall to have kids amd rancho! ramiro will be a great dad!❤️$Alvarez4000
Ughh yes my poor baby was getting bullied the first week of school because hes chubby kids are so mean! But all that starts at home. As parents its our responsibility to teach our kids how to treat people! I hope JJ and Josiah love there new school and make even more new friends! Love y’all RnB fam❤️ $babygoat1114
I’m starting to see Ramiros true colors and I don’t really like it he can be very rude at times and just ignorant. I just don’t like his attitude he seems like a negative Nancy
$Nancyy1313   Hey girl am so glad your so open with ur kids and always teach them that they need to defend themselves and never let no one bully them kids now a days are cruel and it’s so heartbreaking that some kids don’t speak about there problems. Your amazing xoxo
$Daughterofgrace100
Brit please have a conversation with JJ’s teacher and make sure she’s aware of what he goes through because of his long hair so she can be aware and even look out for him. So many parent do a poor job in disciplining their kids and send out their little devils to school and they bully kids. You can also just show up with him on his first day and show all those kids how gorgeous you are so they can think twice about messing with JJ. So happy to know you’re involved with this matter because many parents don’t realize what their kids go through at school and they go one feeling unheard and so alone. ❤️ You’re a great mother. :)
I wish your dad the best of luck on his own. 🤞🏻 $saamloyaa
This channels Content just keeps getting better and better!!! $Mercedesp1
my fave family forever !! $BryannaLandin
Love that JJ stays with his long hair even when other kids tell him something. His a strong kid and shows other kids they can also do it if he can 🙌  $michelleemine

My son has very long hair as well and he says the same thing they’re going to make fun of me and call me a girl so for the school year since now he’s not in kindergarten with a more secluded now he’s a first grader so I’ve been pulling his hair back in a little ponytail braiding the ponytail into a braid and then by the beginning of the school year I’ll start letting him wear his  hair down when he wants to and they will already know he’s a boy and not make fun of him but that he just has long hair.. also you can put a picture or wall art over that ugly brown wood on the wall in your beauty room  $Mikaley86
His kids ain’t your kids girl yes he may love them but damn give his a fucking break 😂
I agree with you Girl!  on that 5day thing 😆

I was very attached to my Tia's bf just like Evi is to Ramiro. He ended being my tio (they got married). To this day he's my 2nd dad in fact I talk to him about stuff I don't talk to my dad about. I love my uncle he's my favorite in the family and my tia,  and he's taught me so much. They'd pick me up every weekend to spend time with them and I always had the best time  Evi is very blessed to have Ramiro and Brit  Their bond is undeniable. 💖
Makes no sense how much i love the twins.. been following yall since yalls small apartment 🥺 $yesiacevedo
Don’t worry Britt. He’ll always have your back and in the end of the day his baby girls have a special place in his heart 💗💗🙏🏻  God bless y’all always and keep up the grind  $mpedrazaaa

My dad was in prison for 7 years while i was younger. I always thought once he got out that he would never take that tome for granted and would want to spend so much time with us. Now that im 32 years old and have a 10 year old daughter and a 7 week old baby he doesnt even try to have a relationship with us or my babies! It breaks my heart. Im glad that you had the time to have him live with you for awhile- he definitely loves you and his grand babies. The effort to keep the relationship goes 2 ways- you guys have been amazing children to him! Everyone is growing and in a different season of life 🦋💜 $mariaccruz
Omg jay jay so cute I’m glad your a good mom educating him right him saying don’t let kids bully you how sweet 🥰🥰🥰🥰.  $LindaaaaM

I love when you post new videos $erikab1989
Brit I advise you to speak to his teacher regarding him being bullied before about having long hair so the teacher speaks up about it so he doesn’t feel uncomfortable.
JJ should try skating I feel like he will really enjoy it too
Take a shot every time Brit says “umm” 🤣

I didn't like year round school or track school. I was never off as my cousins. Th y always had the best summer vacations. I was so jealous. I'm glad my kids have regular school.  $mandigirl79
I love your family videos !!! But I bet the boys are going to miss him the most ! 🤍    $JurneeSongbird01
pop’s is going he’s own way and figuring himself out love that for him wish him nothing but the best y que dios este con el  $DamarisHerrada
Wait till the furniture come in lol  Love you guys SM. 🥰😘😍💝  CA $Paogmzz  Takecare xoxo 😘
I loveeee how Ramiro has an opinion for furniture shopping 😭😂    $crysstalj
i love how you gave your son a mini pep talk about his hair 😭❤️ he’s so adorable! Love that you give him the confidence! $ana699
how far away are you guys from your old school district? i went to a different school in another district my whole HS years but it was like a little less than 10 mins away. 10 mins max. my just just spoke to the school district and they allowed me.
Do it with out the furniture. You could do a before and after video
You can unscrew the shutters in your beauty room and put some curtains so it flows with the vvibezz 💖💖💖🤩🤩🤩 $ndm07
I love how great Ramiro is with the boys 🥺
Hopefully your dad stays on a good path and he’s able to keep being around you guys
I’m Glad JJ knows that it doesn’t matter what anyone thinks. & his words of encouragements were excellent he is such a smart young boy! $yassibabi
Awwe change is always difficult but I’m happy for him & you guys I love you guys little family ❤️ jay jay don’t listen to anyone I love ur hair so much  $sandiyepez
i wish i had a beauty room , but yours is cute 🥰🥰
My son has long hair, his hair is close to his hips. And he is about to be 10 years old. He loves his hair and will not cut it. As a parent with a son with long hair I understand what you think and go threw. I don't want kids saying stuff to my son either. Not just people in school tell him if he a boy or girl, places we go say "oh what does she want to order" or " she has beautiful hair" and we just look and correct them. But nothing wrong with boys with long hair.
Hope you’re doing well! And hope your dad is well! $yassming
Wait for the furniture 😩😍 $sexyeyes209
I love how you guys share even your most sentimental moments!! Always showing your true selves & never posting something your not!! The murillo sisters alwayz keeping it real even when times get rough!! God bless you girls!! ♡♡♡ $keniaxoooo
Aww JJ’s words of encouragement are so cute.  He legit said stay strong 💪🏼🙌🏼. Loves it. CA $deeeeb7
Everything will work out for the better for everyone sending positive vibes. 🙏🏽$moemoneyy30
Aw I love Jayden’s hair and i love how you teach him both boys and girls can have long hair. Also can’t wait too see the couches you bought and can’t wait for the house tour ☺️💞$dajiaperezz
I hope you all continue to have a close relationship with your dad and keep that bond. It’s sad that people can’t teach their children we all come in different shapes, sizes, etc. We as parents can do better 🙂 $AnelMel
I think your dad is a middle aged good looking man. He probably wants to date and be able to have people over without feeling awkward. Good for him getting his independence. Just remind his ass to come over if he goes miss for too long 😂
yay! been waiting for another video of you guys 💗   awww i understand your frustration on changing the boys to a different school   beautybirds xmas gift is nice for the boys   aww JJ 😩🥰  Ramiro: “she has a new project everyday that she wakes up with”  😂😂😂   $chantelmoxxa
Awwww I miss your dad coming out on your videos 😓 .i hope one day to see both of you In your own house with your little family much love ❤️ . $YvonneXOO
Omg I love the relationship that jj and ramiro have!!
I’m a single mom of 3 and I really claim a Ramiro in my life 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Ramiro reminds me of MY step father growing up 😭 He was so LOVING, PATIENT AND, NURTURING 💛 Brit, you’re a fantastic mom too. 🙏🏾
I can’t believe I just started watching you and your sister. I’m watching all the first videos! 🙌🏽  $Cindyluu28
Pleaseeeeee!!!! We need more vids, I love them and ur family, glad that u are all happy with your house now
My dad left me as a little girl.. I lived with him and his new wife.. he got arrested and got deported. He came back and never looked for me until I looked for him.  I wish he would have in my life. Maybe I wouldn't have gotten molested as a kid and teen. I hate my life so much 💔💔💔💔🥺 I used to love my dad and look up to him so much .   Not anymore
I love when you said that Ram took you as you are/how you came. You give me hope as a single mom that I’ll find a love as accepting and understanding as what you have. I know it’s not easy but it’s admirable for sure. Love you britt! $babyveeyo
No matter the differences & distance love how your dad always comes around especially for his kids & grandkids no matter the situation you guys are always gonna need him around  🙏🏼💙$ElizabethGuerraM94
Ahhh can’t wait for you guys to have a baby 😩😩😩😩🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻$sexyeyes209
I love that no matter what you guys support your dad with decisions he makes. It’s good he branches out and finds his new path and he might feel guilty about leaving you and the kids especially but I’m sure that by you guys supporting him , he feels better and at ease ♥️
Maybe for your beauty room change the shutters / blinds color to black so it matches the black drawers and frame since you have marbel already on your vanity stand.
Definitely a bitter sweet moment having your loved ones move in /out 🥰  $cynts11

I hope JJ & Siah like their new school📚 $gmdz9
Everybody goes their own ways, it’s so hard but i feel like that’s how people grow, Brit and Bri have always been humble, that’s what i love about their channel. They stay true to their roots and always incorporate their Mexicans Culture in their Vlogs! I love it $jeenny8
Now I want to go furniture shopping lol   $Foxyflor
Love you guys! Y’all definitely need your own reality tv show ❤️🔥 $ginaav

$OlveraStephanie
I love Ramiros relationship with the boys! I’m here for the consistent content 🤩 Much love RnB fam ❤️ $saragonz
my dad came home from prison 2 years ago & I expected our relationship to be the best to make up for time lost but my dad is out doing his own thing too. It’s kind of hard to accept but I understand. I’m an adult so I don’t need him around 24/7 but I think it’s just us being scared to lose them again. Hoping your dad makes it a point to stay close to u guys & his grandkids!! I always tell my dad to be a better grandpa than he was a parent. The past is the past & it’s more important to make the future better ❤️ $shortysirena
Never a dull moment with you guys ! I always get excited when you guys post I hope one day I get to live the life you guys live always having fun 😭 . You guys as a family are so strong and I love it 🥰  $jasminexo813
You guys should take baby boy for surfing lessons and blog it !! He would love that !!
She said “ the people that are leaving with us” Britney must’ve had a blonde moment right there. Like WTF!
Aww i wish JJ and Siah a great school year you’ve raised them to have each others back praying for them 💓 $Daze622
You are sooo blessed to still have your dad! 💙 mine passed in 2019 & I miss him daily!  $Riiah19
He is your dad and nomatter what people think or say you know your relationship with him and the kid keep the good memories always and keep cherishing him when he comes around. 💗 Ramiro and the kids are your family $nelidapatlanreyes
I love watching your family! $DdmBetsy
Yesssss white is better for the room...
Britt it’s always good to live separately of your parents but I totally understand you when your dad was never around.
$lizzberr  Evi's love for Ramiro is so cute and his little hands when he was hugging him 😍
$envyyeozz27
Feel like ramiros true colors came out today… who else ? Always has his guard up for no reason
I love y’all! Every weekend I put on your YouTube’s and relax with my 🍷 wine and my husband knows to leave me alone! Lol! I hope I win! $kor911☺️
Teach JJ to stay true to himself! Not to change or act different for no one. He’s such a handsome boy and will grow up to be the best version of himself with or without long hair. Great job mom ur doing great ❤️❤️😘
JJ Is So Sweet🥰 Letting All The Kids With Long Hair Know, To Stay Strong and Dont Let Anyone Bully Them❤️   $Prettymilli4
Aww love your family!
Kids are ruthless !! Poor JJ 😟 just be there for him and make him confident that's all that matters 💓💓 $monicabeltval
I love the navy blue color for the sofa $KrystalHernandez98
I love you guys so much!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ I enjoy watching you guys videos all the time😁  $AlexaManrriquez
Change is good !! Hope he comes around still 🤍💛🤍💛 Much love !!!!
Attention parents! Teach your kids not to bully! Teach them at home & talk about it OFTEN! Teach them to help other kids, like when they see someone is sad or alone or in need. We need to engrave this in their little brains because bullying has taken a drastic turn, making more and more kids end their lives!
Where is close caption???? 😭😭😭
Love 💞 y'all always here to support
$Ragee24
I cant wait for the official house tour!!! ♥️🥳   $yurhighnssxo
Hopefully your dad doesn't distance himself too much, so he can be in Jayden, Josiah, and Evys life, as well as you and Bri 😩 yess please post the home tour furnished 🤩🤩🤩 yojre house looks beautiful 🤩 $monicabeltval

You need have a deep talk with him

Change is always hard, but there’s always a great outcome. Being independent is such a good feeling 💗 $deltororosa

Love you guys ! 💗
Nice Long Vlogs Video ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕💕😍😍😍😍🥰
I get so excited every post from you and Bri!! Love you guys & ur fam so much🥰 so proud of how far you’ve both came!! 💗 $alyyyyx
Just wondering if your dad only comes around when it benefits him I hope he’s not taking advantage of you guys he always comes and goes and I don’t think he realizes the effect it has on you guys and the boys he needs to get his shit together and be there for his kids that’s what life is all about if god blesses you with a family cherish them! You guys are amazing daughters all love ❤️ $mommyelyy
Well yeah it was time for your dad to move on even though we know getting out was gonna take time but he needs to spread his wings and as long as ya still talk is all oh ok… Lol Ramiro always gotta calm you down correct you lol
Was her dad living with her in her house before this one? If so I had no idea!!
$h3ba01  I really love ur videos and the whole fam you guys really support each other with everything and anything it’s amazing ❤️

Awh Ramiro & jj playing the game was super cute he’s so good with the kids $WellWishes1
Both Unfurnished and furnished
Maybe he just needs change , he needs to self grow .. it’s probably a very good change for him 🙂.. I mean imagine telling your crush you live with your daughter, boyfriend,grandkids and ex-cuñada 😂
I’m glad your dad is finding his own way, I really hope he still comes around especially for the boys, and the boys are still at a good age to keep making friends. I understand your fear and sadness tho. My son is going to a high school where he had no friends but he is doing great now! Also I feel a house tour with and with our furniture! I’m so happy to see you guys back! Please more videos! $Rdp015

$jvzminvm 🤍✨✨✨
I love your family.
Sitting here with some tea and popcorn ! Spill the teaaaaa women ! $gesellee
10 min and it didn’t notify me that y’all posted 😩 but here I am now!!!! Lol ready for the  yea☕️ lol 🤭
In a way it's a good thing your dad moved out. He's a man and should really be on his own either alone or with his significant other. As long as he's not in another country you can keep seeing him and growing the relationship.
Do an empty house tour and one once it’s furnished
Thank you for posting I’ve been having a very weird day, just emotional 😭 needed this distraction 💞
You know the vibes R&B vibes love the videos keep up the good work I just went to get a new bedroom set went to like 3 stores some didn’t have the furniture until months from now I ended up at Ashley’s furniture...

Aww the title makes me sad but I kind of figured there was something off because he hasn't been around 🥺 and the other day whenhe was around you said ir was the first time seeing him in a whole. I hope things don't change and you guys can keep a close relationship with him 💞 I'm a daddy's girl so I would be so emotional. Wishing your dad nothing but happiness and success 🙏. You're absolutely right you and Ramiro have your own little family and all though your immediate family is important at theg end of the day your little family you created is so important ❤️💙💙💙.

Ramiro: “ I don’t care, with or without “😬
My dad left when I was 6.. the whole town was shocked cause he was the PERFECT dad, city manager, the school’s loved him, then when my mom found him cheating she said she was divorcing him & he legit said “if you divorce me I divorce the kids too.” & he left to San Antonio. 14 years later he’s asking if he can come back to be in our lives and stuff and it’s just like ehh.. 😕 Idk
I love the light pink blush in your face palette literally changed my life 😍
You guys are very understanding when it comes to your dad. I'm glad you guys are still are cordial and love each other! You and Bri always take care of you family. $TrippyLilo
