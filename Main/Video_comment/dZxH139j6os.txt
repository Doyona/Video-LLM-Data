Why is Stroll always the one wasting tyres and parts
Que recuerdos
Lets GO
6:36 haha
4:49 6:04 6:43
6:06 Mercedes hasn't had a front row lockout all season long.  2021 Portugal: Yeah, about that...
Bello
I have enjoy looking back at qualifying from after race on track at Mexico city grand prix.
Friends, JESUS is here to help you only if you were just to ask HIM. HE loves you and is waiting for you to call for HIS help. HE will help you. I bless you al in the name of JESUS . I cast out your demons in the name of JESUS
Would have been great to see Perez win.
Personally, I'm Albon fan. Then I became a RB fan automatically. After he left, I continue support MAX and also all RB and AT drivers. But for the next season, it's enough for me with RB or AT. I'll go with Williams. And the behavior and speech of MAX recently made me doesn't like him anymore..
Go Honda               from Japan
What's with these guys calling each other idiots lol it's so unprofessional.
Forza Max! 🤘🏻
well that was easy. DoDo wolff was silent, and Hamilton asking if anyone was there on the Radio was perfect
and then Max won 😂
So Red Bull manufactured second row grid positions in order to gain an advanatage from the toe. Now that is some 4D chess.
This aged like a fine milk
Que verguenza es valteri botas parece conductor de red bull
Great race for Red Bull and checo too ..  Mexican podium amazing… and what happen to botas is not easy to came back to last place to top teen right … so when checo was a the last one and finish at top teen he did. A amazing race  Tequila time for my boy checo Pérez and Verstapen 😎😎😎
And Mr.Toto continues in tears
M🤡E🤡R🤡C🤡E🤡D🤡E🤡S
come on, where is the race highlights?
I enjoyed this very much
.
lol “what a dumb idiot!”
Hey! Where is the race highlight?
J'espère que mon idole va gagner demain Hamilton 😎
So instead of it being:  1. HAM 2. VER 3. BOT  It's going to be:  1. VER 2. HAM 3. PER  From now on?  Always a 2 for 1, but this time it's a Mercedes fighting against two Redbulls.
ペレスのミスなのに、角田くん災難でしたね
SUPER MAXXXXX
Petition to offer 4k broadcast of F1 in the US. (Currently only available in the UK)
Fangio Award... Congratulations Bottas. You're a great driver.
I'm so tired of a those who are acting like Mercedes is even with RedBull.. Stop the hype RedBull has faster cars and since they changed engines they are even faster now. It's RedBulls Championship to win or lose. Hopefully Max will choke but I don't see it. There's a new Sheriff in Town.
WHO CARES  ABOUT QUALI THE RACE WAS A SELL OUT!!!!
?
Where is the rwce,m
Gasley is so underrated
Vamos checo tu pudiste ganar a mexico le hace fslta este triunfo
Quiero español
Is Max only capable of saying, "What an idiot!"
Yep, Hamilton wondering about that "six and a half tenths" pretty much gave away that Merc had the pace
I hope bottas messes with Lewis all day lol
Cccc
Bienvenidos hermanos a México 🏟️🌇🎉🌁🏔️🏜️🏖️🌎
Saludos hermanos desde México 🇲🇽🇲🇽🌁🌵🏔️🏜️🏖️
Why is Bottas leaving Mercees? Why was Verstappen mad about Perez and Tsunoda off track?
It’s nice to know I’m not the only one that crashes F1 cars.
Max u  so desperate. Relax man be great.
I am not mexian, but I want checo to win mexcian gran prix . He deserves a win here.
Max: I think I'll use "dumb, idiot" this week.
Bottas on pole is just instant win for hamilton. Play defense against verstapen making sure he stays on 3rd.
How have Mercedes not had a front row lock out?
If the mercs and redbulls have similar performing cars this year then how come is Bottas performing so well even though according to popular belief he is trash 🤔
I see they gave Bottas his porridge
Где можно посмотреть прямой эфир гонки,желательно на русском (матч ты не работает я в Турции
What happened to norris
Bottas is showing us that it’s not Lewis but a better car
this Verstappen must be really nice teammate...not
Vamos Sergio Pérez Suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Lewis fans coming out of the woodwork like termites after rain
not Tsu's fault
Made my month this! So happy to C Mercedes 1-2 again
“What an idiot! He got out of my way like he was suppose to but my teammate blew the turn anyway...” cocky waste of space
Did anyone hear an “ooooo” when Stroll made contact with the wall?
Viva mexicooooo ~ Valtteri Bottas 2021
I’m glad for Bottas! 🙂👍🏼
Idiot(s) for what Max ?
Max calling his Mexican team mate an idiot in Mexico.
A
bottas shreking Hamilton again 👌
Vamos checo 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Merc are F1 biggest cheats
Spanish subtitles please
Lewis: My TiReS aRe GoNe Max: WhAt A dUmB iDiOt
Silly Yuki ! but he will learn his lesson i hope and not leave the track next time  to help the bullies ! .... ....Fact is that Yuki wass the only driver that carries no blame whatsoever the the RB mess up
Just hoping for an exciting race. Get in there Checo.  Hopefully no one gets punted out.
Yuki in Q3 yes!
Did max call home teammate a “dumb idiot”? What should Checo and Tsunoda have done?
But can we talk about the fact that redbull gave max’s broken rear wing from FP3 to Perez so he could outqualify him ?
Was expecting a Mclaren pole coz of the thumbnail
Versteppn calling Perez idiot....
Peanut butter jelly time
again mercedes are really lucky like always
Wolff .to bottas  Ur only job is let Hamilton in turn 1 and block Max or even take him out ..🔥🔥 that only way Hamilton can win
“Such a dumb eediet”
Showwww
Max calls perez a dum idiot
valtteri end up 3-4 on race becouze team focus on lewis. 5 years making. lewis bad driver lewis needs points. more points on team if valleri let drive. bad choise let lewis pass 1 lap. if need this can be done end of race. if hamilton is front max. valleri deserve win
Is it just me, or does that Pit Lane Entrance look a little tight!!
Marcelo Domínguez f1 :-)
Perez and Bottas have nothing to lose so might have got the license from their respective teams to go aggresive into turn1 today!
👏🏽👏🏽
Who's Max calling a dum idiot?
Ciye... sing paling puinter dewe sakdunyo nesu2 nyalah2no uwong liyo mergo gagal pole
Aren't there any street sweeper trucks in Mexico City?
Bottas é um bom piloto mas tinha que ter ajudado o Hamilton aí é por isso que ele vai sair da equipe Mercedes acho que ele tinha que ser mais insano se não tiver sangue nos olhos não serve para pilotar
Merc always plays POSSUM. Red Bull is close but not close  enough    Hamilton will win the title   Its all hype to keep people watching and Red Bull fans having hope.  Glad to see Bottas doing so well.
Hebreos 12:1  12 Por tanto, también nosotros, que estamos rodeados de una multitud tan grande de testigos, despojémonos del lastre que nos estorba, en especial del pecado que nos asedia, y corramos con perseverancia la carrera que tenemos por delante.  2 Corintios 2:1  14 Sin embargo, gracias a Dios que en Cristo siempre nos lleva triunfantes y, por medio de nosotros, esparce por todas partes la fragancia de su conocimiento.  Filipenses 3:14  14 sigo avanzando hacia la meta para ganar el premio que Dios ofrece mediante su llamamiento celestial en Cristo Jesús.
Merc is sketchy
My favourite Max tonight is hamilton the winner
Mercs have better pace advantage from Red Bull, congratulations for mercs for having 1st front row lockup this season, can't wait for the race
"Such a dumb idiot." That's how close the relationship of these F1 drivers is.
Commence operation hold up from bottas
Bottas is way better than Russel
人のせいにするやつはキライだ。 そして非を認めず自分の間違いを貫き通す奴はもっとキライだ。 ＹＵＫＩは悪くない。動画を見ればわかる。
My man beaten by bottas
If Max doesn't pass Bottas on 1st turn (unlikely given Mercedes straight-line speed advantage), this race will be over in a few laps.
I understand Perez and Max frustration for  not  getting  pole and  second...but, Yuki got way out of the way to help his sister teammates...but ALL isn't lost for first and second place finish in race today...and  Pierre  third,  and  Yuki come back to finish 7th...not impossible.
Merc wont feel the same without bottas 😭😭
Mercedes reached 347km/hour on the straight, Red Bull reaches 334km. Hamilton the Red Bulls are so much faster then us!
Viva mexico!!!!!!!
... can Verstappen just not talk? Every time he ques the mic he just shows how immature he really is.
Finalmente legenda em português 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I hope this just gets the championship fight even more tight
Gooooo Bottas!!!👍👍🇫🇮🇫🇮
Que maldito error lo de tsunoda
F1:  10 Most unexpected pole positions in History 🤣🤣
Why is Verstappen calling Yuki a "dumb idiot"? He wasn't on the track. he stayed off. He wasn't even threatening or angling in such a way that he'd be close to Max. I don't understand.
Tsunoda is performing really well last few weeks
I love how bottas keeps coming, Mercedes made a wrong move letting him go
We all waiting for Valtteri it's james moment now
Six and a half tenths?
Tsunoda didnt want to do anything like that :(
Mercedes Garage after Q2: Wait shouldn't we have 6 spark plugs?
Chill max.. your using to much anger. We are your fans but you could lose us just because of your words
Max is always so quick to put down other drivers while lewis is more humble and always gives credit to other drivers. I'm starting to root for Lewis in this championship battle.
Mazepin on fire, 19th place and over 1.5 sec gap to Stroll.
"What a dumb idiot". Max Verstappen proofing he is no teamplayer at all once again.
Cry baby Max, like he's never gone off the track, he is the only one stopping himself from being champion, no one else. Atitude.
"Such a dumb idiot" says the man who cant keep his car straight ? okay little buddy.
Yeah right "Dumb Idiot" cuz tsunoda is supposed to be supporting Sultstappen.
There goes Lance crashing his daddy's cash
I hope    Mercedes turned up their engines  for Q3  so  high that their   engines will be  destroyed in the  race.
Who is verstappen calling a dumb idiot?
It's going to be a wild first corner
I hope Max Silverstones Lewis in Turn 1
Checo is going to torpedo down to turn 1 and Take out Lewis and Max with him. A little bit of pressure and he cracks…
Imagine that this is only the first Mercedes 1-2 of the year
just sandbagging
"Mercedes haven't had a front row lockout all season long" I'm afraid your wrong there Crofty
Verstappen calling everyone an idiot, I don't like him
Toto Wolf's fake celebration in front of the camera.😂😂😁🤣
So, they gonna use Valtery as a tow in the start and going for the long straight...well planned Mercedes...😑    Edit: Í think i'm gonna watch WEC Bahrein race...
Verstappen keeps calling people Idiot. Why isn't he getting some kind of financial penalty
I expect a feisty start.
Max loves calling people idiots as much as Lewis loves to say that his tires are gone
Verstappen is boring
What Perez would do for Verstappen if Perez was on pole?
Bet Max will get DNF today😔
Strange how Merc were allowed to make setup changes just before Q1, isn't the car in Parc Ferme after FP3?
6:04 actually they fdid in Hungary
Dont drink the water
RB is still bit faster on Mediums and def faster on Hards esp in race pace
"It's a Ferrari, it's a pig"
perez clown
What’s up with Lando? He being in a bad form since Russian Gp and Ricciardo is great now
Yuki isn't at fault, it was just a bad timing. Finally he seems to get some performance with the car, it's cool to see. There's still plenty of work but I feel like he's evolving fine as a rookie
They will just power drop Valteri at the start so he both blocks Max and gives Lewis a free run to turn 1🙄
This season has properly defined an undercut, and I guess RB will give us another race masterclass
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
😑
Why is Norris now bottom 3?
Yuki tsunoda did nothing wrong. In My opinion he should not have give perez space since he wasn't gaining track position anyway... rly sad for yuki he made space for perez and had to abandon his own lap ao perez could funk up... in verstappen  case it was the engineer that did the wrong call since there was no yellow flag at all... also verstappen calling yuki an idiot was based in the wrong information he got from the engineere
Regards the dusty condition and for the safety factor, surely someone can design a track cleaning system , eg; blowing compressed air from a long pipe towed on wheels . What a help that would be.
Next time Red bull get the pole position in the first attempt.... No Tsunoda's fault as he couldn't disappear.... Alway excuses
😍😍😍😍
Hopefully Max can avoid Crashmilton in the first corner
Pierre going hard! What an underdog
Wow. The commentator can't hide his glee and joy over Verstappens p3.
I'm just waiting for next season for Russell to win the championship
Into turn one max will lead the race🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't mercedes just buy formula 1
P3 it's the best place to start. Clean track and massive tow towards turn 1. And if Bottas blocks the inside Cheko will just punt him into Lewis Hungary style.
in abu dhabi we vote as the best driver of the day KIMI
i just hope max finishes before lewis
Great Run by future world Champion Mazepin
არ ველოდით
Max Vestappen 🇳🇱 hopefully redbull is back
Who's crying now😜🤣😜🤣😜
I can‘t count how many times Aston Martin knocked themselves out of Q2 by trying to set a time on medium tyres… When do they realise that they just aren‘t one of the teams capable of doing that in this season?
Valtteri it's James
0:52 No power. 5 minutes later: Sainz P5
So darf es gerne weitergehen. Max gewinnt und die beiden dahinter. Am Ende ist MERCEDES  "WM".
Tsunoda this is James
Verstappen is really annoying by his language. Always crying like a spoiled baby.
So happy for bottas man! Fully deserved
Alonso eliminated in Q1 - lovely stuff…..
It has to be said ….  Thank you for not putting pole winner in thumbnail!
Let’s go team 👊🏾
Mercedes 1-2 again so boring duh...
Just a little Funfact: Stroll for the second time this season has given another team time to repear their car.
Great drive from Bottas! Happy to see him get such a great result.  And for the commentators. If they would want their commentary on Lewis and Max to be the same. Lewis his part would be more like this : 7 time world champion, Lewis Hamilton, was not able to out qualify his teammate.
Amazing how bottas is already doing alot better now they know he is leaving................🤔
Stroll🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
Tsunoda’s car was not even on track and i dont understand on what Max was mad about🤣🤣 looks like they need someone to blame for covering their mistakes!🤣🤣 typical redbull!
Max: "unbelievable, what a dumb idiot" Who you talking about there max?
Mercedes been sandbagging have they?
I really believe Max carries a microphone for Netflix. Btw not certain why Perez went off and who Max was calling an idiot and swearing at. Formula One is the biggest Drama Queen 👸 forms of racing now. I remember enjoying the technology and innovation part of the sport, now if a driver sneezes it’s a big issue and the drama starts.
Mercedes is cheating. Suddnely they fixed the issues. Suddenly they dont need to have another gridpenalty. FIA and mercedes work together
Verstappen blames somebody other than himself - What a surprise.
Con la velocidad y tu capacidad creo si pudiste aser mas oh si no díganme
Lame Tsunoda, lamest Perez.
Max fancies a tow to the first corner? Does that work here?
Sainz and the engineer in an alternate reality…  Sainz: I have no internet… Ferrari engineer: Unplug and replug the router…
Not sure what happened to RB’s rear wing.
I see stroll daddies boy is showing he can’t drive as usual! It infuriates me that this sport isn’t about the best talent anymore and it’s about how much money you have
Honestly so tired of Mercedes’ we-dont-know-where-the-pace-came-from spiel🙄 funny how they seem to be the only team it consistently happens to. You don’t just magically find over a second for both your drivers between Q1 and Q3..
Why is this video unavailable?!
Everyone is an idiot according to verstappen,  He considers himself the only intelligent guy out there.. This guy is full of himself.
the sandbagging is getting pretty old...
Carlos Sainz Is P6 & Charles Leclerc Is P8 in F1 Mexico City Grand Prix Qualifications 🇲🇽
Again Crashstapen insulting even tho the cars are literally not on the track. No words.
Turn 1 going to be interesting today! I'm in the UK so I am watching at 19.00 tonight.
Max always calling people idiots
best drivers of all time: hamlton schumacher vettel senna prost bottas after being replaced
Max didnt said that on this race gtfoh
Pain for Asians to watch the race:'(
Olé Bottas!
RB really blew this one didn't they lol, will make for an interesting race today!
Whose cry baby now 😂😂😂
I hope Valtteri ignores the team orders that are surely coming his way in the race.
If Hamilton isn't in the lead by turn 1 I guarantee Mercedes will lay out the red carpet for him in turn 2.
Max Verstappen lacks respect big time
keep in mind what happened last time around with the championship contenders in p1 and p3 im
Max👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Hey Max, that "Dumb Idiot" you said over the radio is Tsunoda and Checo your MEXICAN teammate
Toto Ham Lek 👎. Bot Ver 👍👍
Lewis gets booed again and again...what is wrong with you people ..!!!
What is it with drivers only putting in best efforts when about to leave 🤦🏻‍♂️
At the end of the video max says "such a dumb idiot", I'm guessing when the situation is reversed and it's Max who makes exactly the same mistake then the opinion about being such a dumb idiot might be reconsidered.
Wolff to Tsunoda - "come here, we need to talk"
BOTTASSSSSSSSS 💪
Just when you admire Max's talent, he goes and makes himself sound like a brat again by calling people idiots. Needs to show a bit more respect and humility to his peers.
Não há com o que se preocupar.  Max deixa as Mercedes pra trás logo na largada. Max tem espírito de Senna. Por isso será campeão.
*Season 4 Drive To Survive* will probably be the most watched giving the thrill of 2021 F1 season... 🙆🏽‍♀️
So Yuki is being replaced by Albon, where is he going and what about the useless Mazepin or Latifi? Is next years drivers set?
Merc running Bottas with more power now he’s got about 17 ice’s to use
0:45 funny joke
I dont really get it, why Max said "what an idiot"? anything affects him?
What was the Trophy Valterri got ? 😃
What's happened to lando since the break,  he's not been anywhere lately.
So Max saying "Such a dumb idiot", who was he referring to? 1. Tsunoda, the guy who helped him (somehow) couple races back by holding Hamilton as long as he could. Or 2. Perez, his teammate who is doing everything he can to help him get the championship title?  Either way, I don't think it's cool to just call names when you don'tget your way...
Poor Max. Cutting corners didn't help.
Not really a fan of Verstappen when he always offends other drivers if it doesn’t go his way. No respect at all for the other drivers
Ma la Ferrari non diceva che   in questo appuntamento  potevano puntare in alto......!!! e l'ennesima bugia di BINOTTO nei confronti dei tifosi.  BINOTTO deve solo andarsene dalla Ferrari . Affinche ci sara BINOTTO Il 2022 sarà come il 2021 .
Bring it on
Thats what happens when SUPER MAX doesnt get towed by Perez ..
Max and RB you cannot put this on yuki, merc is much quicker than you guys..
6:47 WAIT! He can smile??
Merc (Ham) fans toxic as per usual, it's getting way too cringe
Max called Tsunoda a dumb idiot
Possibile che non si possa commentare in italiano?
shitstappen needs anger management
These german commentators..Just without emotions when stroll crashs xD
Perez is just a bad loser. Yuki did nothing wrong. He should be ashamed that he himself destroyed Max Lap with going off and causing a yellow flag.
Bottas is going to be a future world champion.
*Something bad happens* Max: unbelievablebeleble
During race: Valterri it's James After race: Get in there Lewis RB: because of yuki..
*Sees both Merc front row* "Ahh so thats why this track was dusty"
Come on bottas! Deserved it.
Just a friendly reminder that Valterri Bottas has the same amount of Pole Positions as Lewis Hamilton.
Who's going to Mercedes next year to take the place of Valterri?
“Mercedes haven’t had a front row lockout all season long” but what about Portugal?
Crofty said that Mercedes haven't had a front row lock out this season, but they did in Hungary.
Sometimes I feel bad for Vettel
Actually Max is an idiot himself..He was just slow, it's not the others fault!
Mexico city gp victory; Max Verstappen.
Lance stroll with daddy's cash daddy's cash
Yuki Tsunoda does not deserve to drive for Scuderia AlphaTauri.
Yep those two running of the track...
Max comment just says a lot of this big craying baby. Maybe he should think about it how often mr. perfect was the Idiot in the past.
Q3 as always, unexpectable
Great to see brundle back this weeknds
Quite amazing what Bottas can do once he is not under intense psychological pressure from management. Mercedes should er-evaluate their motivational practices for different drivers - they obviously got it wrong with him.
"Valtteri, it's Toto. You're a great driver but let Baby Hamilton win the race. T.q".
Merceds #1, Yesss
why are they calling it Mexico city GP instead of mexican gp or mexico gp. Mexico city gp implies more racing being held in mexico no? do they not want to called the mexican gp for race reasons or something? i really dont know so someone fill me in. Like Austria. its the Austrian Gp or the Styrian Gp when they held the second race. we didnt call COTA Austin city GP or Austin Gp
We see a Mercedes 1-2 We cry.  ( Unless your a Merc fan )
This just shows how superior mercedes is to others ewen a. Weak wingman can win and with that much gap. When redbul is faster than bya. Tent but merc is. Super fast, Verstappen is a really super driver to stand in championship like he does. The cry baby Lewis has his wingman there.
Stroll is the worst f1 driver atm
Lance stroll doing well. But not as well as marzipan. And tomorrow watch as bottas is forced to move out of the way or suffers a slow pit stop.
Red Bull:  "Manana, we go after a pair of Silver Arrows!" Max & Checo:  "Si!  Si!  Hahaha!  Vamanos, senors!  Vamanos!"
"six and a half tenths" if this is not a enough sandbagging, what did you expect then?
Enjoyed your video and I gave it a Thumbs Up
ahh, crashstapen is learning from the best and becoming a crystapen...
Mazapin is going to take a huge dive bomb into turn 1 to go on a win the race
Now im sure Max is being medicated, uncontrollable rage isnt something that wears off with age but rather get more prominent if unmedicated. So sad for Perez, the little distraction by Tsunoda was enough to throw off his focus for a millisec. Not that i think he could beat Bottas' time but 2 or 3 were both possible.
Are we sure that Perez isn’t driving for Mercedes this season?
Petulant MV again
Mazepin: "i'm boxing."  Team: *Uhhh no*  Mazepin: "why not?"  Team: *Uhm... we're eating an icecream*  Mazepin: "What??!"  Team: *Yeah Sorry*
5:10 track limits though?
i know they're in a pressure cooker but come on max, telling that perez is an idiot is just being ungrateful, you only have a 12 point lead because perez protected you from hamilton @ turkish gp smfh man.
at least sandbagging…
Nada a ver esse comentario do Vestapen no final, Perez e Tsunoda nem atrapalha ele... Ele é tão idiota
bottas hamilton and verstappen crashed and out of the race!! and sergio perez win the mexican gp!! hope this aged well haha
We all just want Checo to win
GO VALTERI!!!!
LFG checo!
new engines able different engine modes so Bottas fastest ..who ever doubt who is still fastest car when needed
Mature Max for you.  Everybody’s a dumb idiot for him.
Carlos: no power, no power.  Ferrari engineer:you nees to press the accelerator, Carlos
Luckilton
6:35 Verstappen: Tsunoda "such a dumb idiot" lol
If Bottas were allowed to race fairly all these years, the world would have witnessed the original mediocre Mr.Lulu
well done Bottas. Let's goo Mercedes!
Do you really want P1 on a track like this?
This race could be decisive in the world championship. We might see team orders from Mercedes if all goes to plan.  If MV doesnt win its significant as RB should dominate this track
Starting to lose respect for max calling people names. Kid still needs to grow up.
Love to see it
James Vowles can't wait to pull back Valtteri Bottas.
"Mercedes haven't had a frontrow lockout all season long" I, too, am for pretending that Hungary and Portugal never happened
Max had better push Lewis off in turn 1
Tsunoda in quali be like: You wanna see some real speed, b****? Imma show you real speed
Gasly is Class.
valterri > russell
They aren't "sand bags".  They are "silica sachets".
what a quali
Time to change the rule. Not many ppl will watch if MB keep winning forever
That is the reason Merc will win both championships. Both drivers can win and take poles, when in RB there is only one.
6:04 "Mercedes haven't had a front row lockout all season long" So, Portugal and Hungary never happened?
very boring circuit....and also starts 9 o'clock....lame....
Not really understanding the hate against Tsunoda here - he wasn’t in the way.
Legend has it that Yuki is expecting a call from Dr. Helmut Marco tonight : )
All my love to Lance hope he’s ok💙
5:10 is that a normal to cut track like that ? All 4 wheels inside the white line
What just happened there last night 😳
Horner is a horrible boss. Throwing his driver under the bus with no thinking.
Max throwing a paddy at the end. What a tool
Pls any one explain what happend between yuki and max❓️
its better to start 3 or 4 on this track..... long to first corner
Mercedes 1-2 on a Red Bull track?! 😳 Mercedes is also a fraud  Ferrari is nowhere near Mercedes  He didn't get any further  Yeah, and Alpine is pretty bad, too
Guys bottas cheated
Well done bottas your always up there its just such a shame hes not allowed to win it just makes it all a joke so come on max take it to them.
Botta sooooo underrated by merc
Buen video!!!!
Just imagine if Bottas was in a red bull next year 😅
Merc is back kids! We are fast again!
It is necessary that one of the pilots beat Verstapen, he constantly all the pilots to swear
All want Redbull 1 &2
It is necessary that one of the pilots beat Verstapen, he constantly all the pilots to swear.
Max win for TMR
Listening to Max radio they are all idiots except him self.....
Yuki :(
Sir jackie wearing Mexican tartan at the end..
Lance "er pippa" stroll
Go Lewis...😎
They have had a front row lockout tho in Hungary, crofty
Six and a half tenths??? 😂😂😂
Ferrari No.1 always
Yuki is not bad at all.
c’mon bottas, he’s flying indeed!
Verstappen just calls anyone who happens to be off the track an idiot. Not cool.
It will definitely be an interesting race start and first lap tomorrow.  Hopefully they make it around turn 1.
Trust me the mercs gonna mess up the pitstop
Yuki got Christian Hornered
Still think max is gonn win this one
Mexican sun is a mind eraser, as Carlos has forgotten how to drive! 😂
Valterri this is james: testing comms for tomorrow
max telling his team mates idiots :(
Mark my words, either Max is winning this, or Lewis and Max crash at turn 1 after the start
Muy bien !!!?
Verstappen finally said something sensible about himself.
each event must be separate from the other... and i HATE THE IDEA of engine penalties etc... ONE ENGINE PER RACE WEEKEND.... I don't want someone to take a new engine, get 50 more HP, but then take a grid penalty for the next race.....   one engine per weekend
Red Bull: We are Da best.  Mercedes: SURPRISE !!!
Lewis in practice: we 6 tenths down.  Mercedes in qualifying lockout.   Fans : 😲
Just stay calm Bottas,tommorow after first corner,you jump into 5th place
It wouldn’t be F1 if someone didn’t call another an idiot
honestly fiestr merc 1 2 in all year its tricky and i think this will be a very great race
On another channel this was commented:  Max's "what an idiot" radio transmission was taken out of context in the live broadcast. He asked his engineer what happened there and his engineer said "I don't know... Looks like Yuki parked it and forced Sergio to go off", which obviously wasn't what actually happened.  Did Formula 1 pull a little Drive To Survive here?
According to the Thumbnail : Daniel put up a stonking lap to pick his 1st pole position for McLaren, his 1st non Red bull pole, 2nd pole in Mexico & his 4th pole in his F1 career
Who Max Verstappen named an idiot? Perez or Tsunoda ?
Hamilton crashes with Bottas please.
Anybody going against Lord Crystappen is always an idiot
I think they had front lock out in hungary gp already
Bottas - How's it ?  James ~ Just don't mate , i Promise I'll pay you back.
Verstappen always crying someone else.. He never do dumm things right🙈🙈🤡🤡🤣🤣
Toto - What went Wrong.  Team ~ we're looking into it.
Totto: Hire a new team of Engineers. James: Why? Totto: We need to break Bottas Engine...
VB! VB! VB! 🔥🔥🔥
Get in there mercedes...
Tsunoda's adventure cost both RBR drivers a chance, LOL.
Kwalifikacje
Someone tell me why the Perez/ Tsunoda incident slowed Verstappen?   Apart from "distraction" what caused the slow down?
Uh... Crofty said it wrong. It's not there first front row lockout. Remember Portugal?
It would be pretty classy if they let Bottas race for this. Given how Max controlled Checo’s race  from the seat of his car last race.
Viva Zapata!
Toto Wolf this is the worst track for our car. I hate him so much
when you close a 0.6 sec gap in 2 hrs there must be an increase of engine mode right? who and how do they check and control that anyaway???
Breaking news: A technician was seen rubbing a special "go fast" substance on the rear wing of Checko's car right before qualifying. What, he still finished behind Max? Plan B, I repeat Plan B.  Meanwhile at Aston-Martin: Lance are you OK? Ya I'm alright. Hey has anyone else noticed that Cognicant is misspelled on our cars?
0:36 in in in in in in
As a Hamilton fan bottas taking pole helps a lot
Max sometimes can be a but egotistical and rude. How can someone be an idiot if they make a mistake, have you never made one before max. I would fight him if he called me that
I only saw Q1 and Q2  At least P1 for Valterri and P2 for Lewis
RB will have strong race pace.
Stroll still driving as a rookie🙄
Mercedes se va arrepentir de haber dejado a bottas.
lets predict the start, bottas will have a bad start and hamilton will take the lead?
cant wait
Checo will be in the podium
Get in there Valtteri!
Gasly is impressive 🔥
Mercedes- Surprise Surprise MF.
and Bottas has taken an engine penalty on Sunday.
Carlos Sainz is so underrated
No "idiot" would want to go off track...
On a positive note.  Saul "Canelo" Alvarez became the first Mexican undisputed super middle weight champion today. Cheers.
Gasly again on 🔥
Wow! so much for the hype that the Mexico circuit favours the red bulls.
Super happy for Bottas, according to Max everyone else is an idiot 🙄
max should watch what his rich spoilt mouth says
Merc do be always sandbagging FP3 then taking pole on quali, I forgot the track where they were 7 tenths down but manage to take pole anyways just like here
Its so funny to hear Max swearing yet again when other drivers ahead of him have actual issues in the track. What does he expect in the track? For him to race alone and every other driver to give him way? Seriously immature this fellow.
we will remember in F1 history, MV is the smartest person on grid.
Well ; I am still pretty sure that its red bull's track. With full fuel load Mercedes are almost half a second slower than red bulls in FP3. This turns out that it doesn't take much more than five laps for max and Perez to overtake Mercs  unless Mercedes figures out bit more improvement tonight🧐
Yo baby, a sight for the sore eyes.. Mercedes Front Row Lockout....🔥🔥🔥🔥
¡Viva México!
Even after using bias energy from Martin Brundle, Hamilton could only score P2.  Great Job Bottas!
Que sea en español los comentsrios no me gusta el ingles
Yeaaa..even RedBull have a power machine car.  But they have two idiott driver that always complain when looser 😁😂😁😂😁😂😁
I’m a Red Bull fan but the Mercs really showed precision today. Kinda feel bad for Bottas, his last races with a top car must be tough and always being Hamilton’s wingman must be frustrating. Wish him well next year. On a different note, should be exciting to see how Russell performs. Seems like a cool, humble kid.
Bottas was on fire ....Even without  tsunoda incident redbull couldn't have got pole......
A person is off the track far from racing line ——> impacts Max’s lap somehow. That checks out.
Incoming "Valtteri, it's James"
I thought every Media is saying this is a red bull track without considering Mercedes.
For a change, Gasly is P5
Did I hear max getting mad at perez and calling him a idiot
Немцы вы все ровно про играите кубок конструкторов HONDA 👍1
Man you can hear the crowd going wild. 😐 Amazed how the Mecs got the front row lock out but the crowd 🤣
Yea..Bottas Hamilton 👏👏👏
Fuera de joda terrible error de perez en el ultimo intento, podia aunque sea quedar en top 3
The unsung Hero of 2021 - Pierre Gasly. He definitely Deserves a better Car.
Love the sound on this track!
Как можно носить платье хэмилтон позор
Believe me, there will be: "Valteri, its james" Hahahahahahahahaha
Mean while on radio, Max this is James, time to ram into Valteri n Hamilton for championship points, take them out :D
stroll: crashes someone: "when you drive, never drink"
Straight to the comment section for the experts opinions!
Bottas on Pole, wanna see how will Mercedes Sacrifice him for Lewis
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Mercedes sandbagging in free practices is just pathetic !!
It seems like the merc tyres worked better when the track temps rise
That Tsunodu guy is a dangerous driver, let's hope it does end in traggity 😔
角田選手を応援させて頂いてます！明日は良いレースになるでしょう！
Espero ir al prox. O en un años 👍
Bottas really doesn't care any more, it turns out. Throwing the kitchen sink at everything
Hope Lewis wins tomorrow followed by Bottas....Perez third and Verstappen DNF 😁😁😁
Bottas show merc your true talent atleast this time you don't have anything to loose now
Go On MERCS!!!!! SILVER ARROW 1-2 TMRW
James, its vallery
Bring back the v8 and the v10 and 12,s.  Because these blow driers sounds terrible.
mercedez sand bag so much that they and all of their fans have become deuchbags
Feeling sorry for Bottas
Amazing there was no yellows, could of been bad for Perez, and to still not show any after Perez went off, seems like the Health n Safety went out the window to not hurt the Red Bulls
The crash of Lance Stroll at 0:13 is exactly the way we crash in playstation😂
Riccardo is finally used to the car now it seems, but its going to change again next year so we will see how they both go with a new car
Verstappen was already slow, they just used Yuki as a scapegoat
Mercedes had front-row lockout at Hungary this year, Crofty??
Nice work Merc.
Man like Bottas.
Mercedes letting go of VB is such a waste.
The track is still dusty from all the Mercedes sandbagging.
COME ON YUKI
Glad Lewise didn't get pole.
Bottas ruins RedBull's F1ESTA.
Happy for Bottas taking pole, but team orders will prevent him taking the win. Wolf will instruct him at the first opportunity to let Hamilton pass if he goes into the lead.
Gassy still being in an Alpha Tauri seat next year is a joke. He has quietly put out one of the best seasons so far, up there with Norris for sure
Lets goooooooo
Wow....the commentators... as if Mercedes won the race already....hahaha
Verstappen: "unbelievable! such a dumb idiot"  😂who's the dumb idiot? Tsunoda or Perez
well done guys
I see the Crashtappen fans are quiet 🤫 in the chat. Specially how he was cutting corners like a barber and not one peep huh?
art of sandbaging
I'm starting to agree with Hamilton. It's getting old listening to Max call out everyone else as a idiot when it's so easy on this platform to find evidence of his own failings.
Interesting track and stand set up . I guess they LIKE watching the fastest cars in the world go 30 MHP .  What's next a parallel parking contest ?
Tacos did Bottas well
Brundle needs to be replaced.
Mercedes front row lockout? Wow!! I told y’all!! This season is different, I warned not 2 b surprised by this!!
Yuki such an inexperienced driver. There is no room for this Japanese driver once Honda’s influence fades.
lewis' face after seeing that fangio award
Being Nowhere near in the FP3 and locking out 1-2 in qualifying is the most Mercedes thing to do....
Mercedes1-2 😭 Another disappointing quali
5:14  it's obvious that checo did a careless mistake, yuki went off first. also, checo/yuki were at the side of the track & max could've aced his lap. so, i don't even know why yuki was called a "dumb idiot" by max & horner said "we got tsunoda'd"
Bottas on pole just to punch the air for Lewis on start
Time for Perez to be a team player again by punting the two Mercedes in t1 tomorrow
Wow, did Max really called Checo a dumb idiot?
Max: "What a f*cking idiot!" Talk nicely about Checo!
This was as unexpected as rb letting Perez win if they were in place of mercedes
Ppl should stop saying *wasn't expecting bottas to be up there* while thy expected checo to get pole :(
"Simply simply dumb idiot" 6:24
don't blame every one else for your short comings Max
Yes Mercedes bring it 👍🏻
GO MAX! 🏁
Tsunoda kick F1
Something happened to Norris, he's not being himself
"I think we got Tsunoda-ed". Yeh 💯%
Stroll needs to go. Mediocre season at best. Anyone else driving like that would be fearing for their seat next year
#44
Criedstappen as always...
Mercedes had a front row lockout in Hungary
Toto looks very happy
King Lewis
imagine in the first corner Hamilton crashes into bottas
Sigma male Bottas does it again
Max has matured so much...
He can complain all he wants. Those two were out of his way and even so he should have got it done in the first run
Is it me or the camara angles show the cars with there actual speed!?
Max is a spoiled child. Everything needs to fall in the place for him otherwise he starts to cry like a baby.Everybody else is an idiot for him.Child.
Well done Silver Arrows, let's hope for the same tomorrow
I can write a book on why should not like max verstappen 😌
Verstapen using the “idiot” word on fellow drivers show that he has no class and he is not a world champ yet. Lost respect for this guy
carlos casually getting taught on how to drive an F1 car
‘What an idiot’ max has never made an error. Psh
Man these commentators are so biased!
Carlos : No power, no power... Ferrari engineer : remember saint, left pedal is brake, right pedal is accelerate
Does not metter that much race is long and red bull has the pace
tsunoda throw him out bring kyvat back
On race day: Valtteri, it’s James. Please allow hamster to pass. Thanks
Seems like commentators are breastfeeding  Mercedes...They sounded very happy when Mercedes had front row lockup and dull voice when redbull had it.
That quali went wrong with Yuki, Perez and max. Lando stayed 10 because of engine penalty
Stroll is do far out of his League!!  But he won't be dropped because of Daddy's Money!!
Nice! This would be a great race for the championship run!! Go Hamilton!
If Hamilton wins this wdc its probably the last year I watch F1 until he resigns. Nothing against Hamilton, but its so boring with the same WDC all the time.
Happy for Botas
Anyone else think that is strategic from RB
That's a cool pole position award tho... I bet Lewis and Max must be really annoyed and wil be jealous of Bottas😅😅😅
Karma for redbull ..using alpha tauri as sacrificed lambs..
I think Max learnt the word idiot be4 anything else.
Go ahead Hamilton!!!
That was unexpected.
And another protest from red bull again and again
Mercedes did not shock anyone max will win u don’t know
Why does alpine always do this to alonso when all the drivers are doing a last flying lap they box him as if he is sitting in top 5 or something ,it's been many races
I can't stand Max and him always calling people names. The whole world does not revolve around you, young buck. I hope Lewis crushes him these last few races and wins his 8th title.
Mexico GP is my new favorite track.
"Yuki ,this is Toto"
Dang it Max... Someone will wreck tomorrow.
Max leads by turn 1
Why is everybody mad that Merc sandbags?? isn't that point of racing, to play your cards effectively when the competition is least expecting it?? If I was Merc I'd turn my engine down too in practice too.. You people need to admit to yourselves that you're haters.. Max will probably still win the DC this year anyway
Vamos ... mañana sera un gran dia😎😎
Ladiesssss and gentelmannnnn The silver arrows are backkkkkkk
A real Noah's ark out there today eh chaps?
Perez should have Max use the tow. Anyway, Perez wouldn't have been able to move up. RBR declined because it was Perez's home race.
2:50  That's when Kimi got offended 🙄
This Big ear Trumpist keeps calling everyone an idiot what's wrong with him?
I feel like people should give credit for Tsunoda in this championship! The guy seems like he is casually messing around with the "sharks". Definitely on the lookout for next year.
There's absolutely no way Yuki can be blamed for that
watching toto celebrate is kind of unsatisfying
...♪ Qué dulce encanto tiene tu recuerdo, Merceditas.... ♫
これはペレスのオーバーシュートだろ 角田を攻めるべきではない
If you are a McLaren fan, this very short video provided just as much air time of cars 3 and 4 as Sky F1s live coverage did.  Absolutely ZERO in Q3.  Unfortunately for those of us who are fans of any of the 19 drivers not driving car 44, Sky F1 really doesn’t cater to us.
Stroll makes quali interesting
Let's go Valtteri!!!
0:12 When you drive never drink  Kimi: *triggered*
Take out the competition max return hamiton the favor and bottas
Now we know Norris falls under pressure
Tutto il weekend dominio Redbull... Poi in qualifica doppietta Mercedes. Parkour.
Where's Norris at?
Once they get out of 1st gear, the Ferraris still look slow
i think redbull didnt take front row becouse want the slipstream at the straight start
Yuki become scapegoat. Bottas will fly off when lights out. Hope Mercedes doesn't mess up tire strategy.
Not a single shot of Daniel ricciardo all red bull Mercedes what a joke
james: bottas its james, we have a problem , hamilton its slower than you , let him pass
Shout louder
Hats off to Pierre and Yuki for getting top 10👏👏 those honda engines are thriving
Sainz: No power Engineer: Imma fix that for you. 😁😁😁
Was expecting Verstappen on top, but I'm glad Bottas is up there. I hope one day, Mercedes, Alpha Romeo or otherwise, he can take a drivers title. I think he really deserves it.
The " unbelievable, such a dumb idiot" was for who? Perez or the alpha tauri?
First time felt like a team sport in a long long time
I'm really not at all worried about RB not being on the front row. They'll make it up down the straight to turn 1
I respect Lewis race craft and achievements but I really hope Max wins the world championship.
Lorence paga perros....
The track needs to be vacuumed.
You sure this track is a Red Bull park?
Mercedes is clearly just running their superior engine as hard as possible to try and get Hamilton that WDC. The pace they have isn't achievable by other cars unless they start blowing up engines. That's why they're having "reliability" issues, they're making up half a second a lap on their engines. Cost caps, new regs, can't come fast enough. They'd be at risk from midfield teams right now if they didn't have that much money to throw around.
I swear if Lewis takes the win I’m gonna be so mad
Lol the comments here are just too fun when ever mercedes are ahead oh no their car is just too fast but when it's redbull no one says anything. Its just a shame that max has a chance of beating lewis where he's in a nerfed car. If u don't know what I mean go compare 2020 qualifying sessions to 2021
We need an "Oh yes!" Shirt lol
👏👏👏👍👍👍💙💙💙
Yes!
Bottas engine change penalty is coming
Shut up max
Another tight slap to dog wolf by bottas
AHAHAHAHA hilarioyus how quali highlights get less likes when hamilton is on pole poor b*tthurt max simps
Did Max call his teammate an idiot
Nice, F1. As someone who didn't watch the live quali, I thought Ricardo snatched pole from Bottas.
44 yes
Verstappen calling other drivers "Idiots"! please F1 drivers, please make sure not to make any mistakes and ruin her majesty's perfect lap.
I agree wth max . Tsunoda shouldn’t be in F 1 yet
Dominant pole position by Bottas!
Man this 2021 season is insane.
First turn is going to be full of bullshittry. Can't wait.
👀
Why is ver se Allen always so grumpy bruh Jesus
Bottas🔥🤯
ok go on then bottas
Bienvenidos a México...
This new engineer has cared more about Lance in three races than Brad in almost three years.
easy strategy for mercs, bottas gives the tow to hamilton and then "he loses the lead" at turn one, and if he manages to crash any redbull its a bonus check, haha Just kidding, but the strategy will be exactly that, let hamilton pass by turn one while blocking the redbulls
🤝👍
Get in their hammy
Lap 1: “valterri it’s James give position to Lewis”
Gasman p5. Woahh
LH: take Bottas out of my way Toto:Roger ...your way is clear
Race Engineers : No Heroics in turn 1  HOW  HARD CAN THAT BE
Wow, how mercedes finds pace?
O Palmeiras não tem mundial.
Let's go Hamilton
Max you need to chill with your team mates man...
Honestly, hats off for bottas.. the poor guy will prolly need to lose that position for Lewis' sake :/
Pretending they don’t know from where that power came from :D yeah whatever
Yuki yuki daisuki.. Yuki yuki daisuki..
Max blaming someone else as usual 🤦🏼‍♂️. Bottas is fast when signed to another team 🤔.
buying seats should be banned.
Run Yuki, the one eyed man is coming.
O que a band fez hoje não se faz! Mais do mesmo👎
No way that was Tsunoda's fault cmon...
I still want to know who Max was calling a “dumb idiot”     Maybe we didn’t see what he saw?  But who did he mean?
Gratz to Mercedes for getting pole
I'm calling it now max will overtake Lewis by turn 1 via slipstream.   P1: bottas P2: max P3: lewis  This season is so exciting!
Valterri will find a way …to get rekt in the race lol
Knew merc were going to be on pole When Lewis said “where are they getting 6.5 tenths?” He has done this before
Verstappen talking about himself??
Redbull track? Lol🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think bottas is a better driver than Hamilton.......he got chance of getting poles than Hamilton ........If he just wants he will get it.....Mercedes doesnt allow him.
Ferrari radios are getting funnier!
You have to love the fear that runs through perez's and tsunodas blood for fear of messing up max's lap.  Actually hilarious, imagine calling the driver in another team for messing up your lap that probably came about through  the fear of messing up max's lap.
RB got 'Tsunoda’d!’ – Christian Horner
did verstappen really call perez an idiot ? or tsunonda
thats a miracle for the mercedes
Can’t wait to hear “George, it’s James” next season
No pressure on bottas and he's driving at his best
Come on Verstappen more respect for your partner Pérez
Looking at past race highlights I think you wouldn't want to be in front row so I don't know merc done the best thing or not
Ole out
Im worried about Lando
Well here’s to hoping for a lap 1 crash to take out both Merc and both RB cars…. Ready for this season to be over..
Why the track is so dusty? Don't they have broom in Mexico?
(Valtteri takes the pole) Tomorrow: "Valtteri it's James"...
Red bull: were gonna start p1 and p2 Mercedes: im gonna ruin this mans career
THANK YOU JUST IT !!!
It’s a long run to turn 1
Qatar Airways
Why does Verstappen like to call others idiot, just because they go off track due to mistakes?
Verstappen gagal Pole Position 😌
I find it irritating. These commenters just talk about Hamilton for the whole time
Bruh what happened to RB pace?
Valterri it's James in first lap itself tomorrow
Mercedes active rear suspension on fire....
Too bad Valtteri's pole means nothing as he'll let Lewis by on the first turn
I want rain to stop the race! No laps. O race!
Didn’t Verstapen call Perez a dumb idiot during the final lap? Pure class. He’s your teammate bud!
Bet nobody had a Merc front row.
Well done bottas
GET IN THERE BOTTAS!
Oh! A Mercedes 1-2. Such a fresh new result. Definitely watching this one.
this track is trash
Why is Max always crying? Jus race bruh
YES MERCEDES.YES.
It's because RBR couldn't manage the softs. They'll be way better on the mediums so should win out over the course of the race. They don't need to take risks into turn 1
Perez to dive bomb both mercedes on turn 1
doesn't ever feel like a great race to watch on TV this one, track shape is ok but something off with how we see it.
I’m sensing a “Valterri, it’s James” tomorrow
Honestly thought "How can Red Bull be better? Merc has better straight line speed and... Mexico has the longest straight on the calender.", so Merc lockout wasn't surprising to me. Still disapointed Checo didn't get pole...
Formula 1 rules are strange.
Verstappen always calling names to the other drivers...
Let the race begin
Best pole trophy of the year that’s for sure.
Who is Max calling a Dumb idiot???? Tsunoda or Perez?
Thank you Bottas for coming to the Party. Lets get P1 & P2  Mercs @ the finish-line Tomorrow.
Needed ricciardo in the second row to dive bomb that first  turn after the long straight
Max says his Honda powered team mate are Idiots 6:37. Where is the respect?
where is hamilton, isnt he the best driver ? @crymiltonfans? why isnt he taking pole from a man who is fired for beeing to bad to compete on top lvl ? its just funny to watch how people think he is the greates off all time. he just had the best car in 8 years
he ate 30 tacos to power up
Gaslys is faster than Ferrari?
No way
Max is  a genius and everyone else including RB and Alphatauri are idiots.
Toto Wolf made the red bull rabbits a fool with his turtle strategy 😂🐢🐢🐇🐇😂 all weekend they where bragging max this and max that.. even the metrics showed how fast was red bull was most of the seasson and then 💣🤭
I'm rooting for Max for the championship but I have to say Bottas recently has been brilliant ever since Mercedes is actually letting him race   He's earned Fangios helmet fair and square
Ya max, call "idiot" to the guy thats racing on home race and you team mate  ;) Remember when the others called you idiot? Ill love seing you not winning a world champion... ;)
I dont get why people turn a blind eye to Verstappen's toxicity to other drivers. He has been verbally trashing other people all season long and Hamilton who questions team tactics is the main focus? Hmm...
At the time Lance Stroll crashed and just barely crossed the finish line, his lap time was still faster than Mazepin.🤣
So much for civil commenting from the drivers. Idiots!
max needs to grow up
Bottas must let Sir Lewis pass on the first lap and block RB....just like they did in US RB that is....when Perez let Max lead the race.
Alonso 😂😂 go home grandpa
0:36 inininininininin
Love the colourful circuit!
A long straight until T1, Max gets the slipstream from both the cars ahead. Both the cars ahead will fight, what could possibly go wrong?
Why is it MSC, not SCH?
Danny Ric on the thumbnail, and ends up P7 behind a AlphaTauri & Ferrari...
bottas nothing to lose..just flexing
Crofty you out of your mind? Mercedes had a front row lockout this season in Hungary
Tomorrow: "Lewis, its James..please abort the to overtake your teamate from lap 1 until checker flag"
VIEW * NICE AWES0ME C00L KEEP_IT_UP ! INDEED ....   📳📳📳📳💻💻💻💻⌨⌨⌨🖱🖱🖱🖱💽🏆🥓🥓🥓🥓🥓🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎💨💨💨💨💨💨💨
No problem max... still we can win... n bottas pls don't take team orders...
Congrats to Bottas
We want onboard of his pole lap
Fantastic. It's 2 vs 2
My prediction for Turn 1 tomorrow  Max absolutely sends one up the inside, cuts the kerb a bit and ends up in P2  Chad Alonso in P1 after not breaking for turn one at all and just sending it through the grass
Poor Perez
-no power! -just rev up
My favorite part was Bottas “ Viva Mexico!”
Bottas P1. Lets Hamilton pass and smashes Verstappen.
This honestly is the most exciting season of f1 in a long while. It’s just a rollercoaster every gp
What happened Lando bro make a comeback soon 😒
Max calling someone a dumb idiot is understatement.
The only mercedes that I want to win
I still can’t imagine being the son of Michael Schumacher and here you are in F1 driving for HAAS always set up to be at the back.
Lap 1 ... Turn 1.... Hamilton and Verstappen side by side... Monza vibes!!!!
F1 = Motocross.  Guys on pole stay in first place.  Guys in back punt each other into the fence.
Ilegal power unit, ILLEGAL POWER UNIT
2nd row better than 1st
My prediction is that nikita mazepin is gonna crash
LEEEEEETTTTSSSS GOOOOOOOO
Nos estorbo  Yuki tsunoda en una última vuelta de la qually
F1: P5? Gasly: I will take that, thank you!
Tomorrow at the race,  Valtteri it's James......
Vamos checo Pérez sube al podio
Not bad for someone who was fired
What I was afraid was gonna happen ended up happening, overhyping redbul and then this performance comes out.   *- or was it part of el 🅿️lan*
f1 momento
Bravo Valtteri
Merc is sandbagging
I'm Betting he has had porridge before quali
Daniel Ric on Podium tommorow💪💪💪💪💪 Max and Lewis will collide
Lewis lewis lewis lewis !!! 😂😂😂 Where are the max fans ? 😂
Merc pace is not as fast as RB in one run.  Let see in the long run tommorrow what will be gonna happen.
Max talking to himself🤣🤣🤣🤣
bottas' reaction made me so happy
I hope the Mercedes garage goes up in flames
¡Viva México, cabrones!
Max Moaning at the end there, nothing to moan about its F1 these things happen, have you never gone of the racetrack before, exactly, stop moaning you moaner lol
yesssssssssss mercedes 1and2
Wao, what sort of upbringing does Max have? Calling other drivers dumb idiot. I don't think he understands English. He tend to use any word that comes into his mouth irrespective of its meaning. I know he didn't finish high school but that doesn't mean he shouldn't exercise some manners.
“Unbelievable Idiot” should be copyrighted by Max.
Boo
"Valterri, James acqui, Vamos"
Red Bull is a terrible team. Throwing Tsunoda under the bus and blaming others instead of blaming themselves. Inexcusable comments from Verstappen.
Yeah Mercedes
Max max max sempre max
Gasly in 5th, patient like a stalking butler...
Bulky Tsunoda
What a crowd it looks like ancient Rome meet a Bullfight. These cars are crazy fast
Max likes to call everyone else bad names. Very unlikeable personality.
The Result that we needed! Congrats Merc! Lets win this tomorrow!
Max and Red Bull crying actual baby tears is just the best noise in F1
maFIA 🤡🤡🤡 Perez goes out of the track but the maFIA didn't give the yellow flags because it will hurt Crashtappen time 👎👎👎 Unbelievable 🤡🤡🤡
Verstappen about to cause some crashes at the 1st corner
Bottas the new Torpedo tomorrow
Nothing like qualifying on a dirt road...
Ahhhh yes Lewis it's James
Happy for Valterri. Too bad team orders will swap them tomorrow.
max is right
Max and Checo will come together in the first few corners, Valtteri will let Lewis past… the rest is history 🙏
Toto: not bad for number 2
Haaaaa take that  what a turnaround well done mercs
mercs playing game right now.. not showing their true pace in practice..
"6 and a half tenths"
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT GASLY?!?!
Stroll was too busy watching hockey lol
Feliz Navidad to Valtteri Bottas
"Sergio, it's James..."
Tsunoda your getting sacred in the morning your getting sacred in the morning😂😂
This video is not available….
People commenting like they've driven an F1 car.
Please don’t crash tomorrow 😂😂🍿🍿
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥳🥳🥳🥳
Guaranteed to get one "unbelievable" in every race from Max. Believe it mate, cos it's happening
What McLaren should of done is let Ricciard go then cause an incident with Lando as everyone was behind them
Mazepin P15
Will Bottas do Mercedes a favour and take Verstappen out or get back for all “ Vallteri it’s James” radios bu taking hamilton out..
Hopefully a Ham Vers crash early and we can see a proper race between the others, and some new faces on the podium. Title fight just gotten boring now
Poor Tsunoda, he was doing such a great work testing his honda motor this weekend and this bad timing ussue happens. I'M WAITING TO WATCH THE RACE TOMORROOOW!!!
Why does max always have to insult  everyone.
Race day : Valtteri It's James
hamilton wins here.,
"Ok Bottas we invert the position at turn 1"
Japa did not wrong
💜️🖤
Alpine doing 1 lap in Q1 like they had a RB / Merc is a thing that tilt me
Can you explain to me what tsunoda did on the track if I had to penalize?
Take the inside line into turn 1 tomorrow Max!
Lucky Mercs
Y u have to be mad it’s just a race
6:38 Hamilton crying about his language
GO MERCEDES!!! ALSO I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE KEPT BOTTAS ONE MORE SEASON AT LEAST. HE IS ON FIRE!!!! I'm a Hamilton fan, but Bottas deserves more credit for his achievements lately. GO MERCEDES!!! KEEP FIGHTING!!!! WHAT AN AWESOME SEASON!!!!
I feel bad for Valtteri tomorrow. Definitely if Mercedes could, Mercedes will.. and will switch Bottas and Lewis for P1.  And I hope Vatteri dismisses the plan
Ricciardo is fairly consistently out-pacing Norris this second half of the season. He seems to be finally getting a feel for that car. Hopefully he doesn’t take so long to get used to the 2022 car.
Conclusion of this video.  Mercedes - Get IN there.  Max - Whine.
Well done Merc lads👌
Mercedes had a front row lockout in Hungary!
Why was there a reupload of this and why did they cut out the nice Intro?
Merc with the front row lockout 🤦🏽‍♂️
Realmente el tsunoda la cago con checo 😐🔥🇲🇽
やったねボッタス！でも明日のスタートとのあと、あれしないといけないんだよな…
"Get in there, Valtteri!" "Now get out of the way and let Lewis win."
Lewis and Max crash into each other all the last 5 races, 5 DNF for both and Bottas wins all 5. We get #77 as champion!!
Who exactly is a dumb idiot max? Yourself? Agreed.
its nice to see Bottas without chains reminds the old Bottas from Williams,  sadly he sold his soul to the devil
Unbelievable jeff
Just goes to show when the pressures off(bottas) is a quality driver. Performing under pressure shows the man from the boys (verstappen & Hamilton)
"dumb idiots". 😐
lets go mercedes!!!!!!
Does Hamilton have a three place grid penalty?
So Bottas would have gotten pole on his second lap too, no argument who was fastest today... no ifs or buts about Lewis' pace
I don't know what Max was complaining about those two cars were far off track. At the end of the day Max didn't have the pace.
Obnoxious max showing his immaturity
that aston is evil :'(
F1 TV: Shows Perez for 5 minutes straight Stroll: I need attention Crofty: WHAT IS HAPPENED? WE NEED TO KNOOOOW
Blablabla Max 🤣
Who was Max calling an idiot?
Interesting how Vesrtappen is always calling people idiots... you can tell a lot about a person by the way they refer to others under duress ...
"Bono my sandbags are gone!"
Ha haaaaaaa yes potas p1💪🔨❤🤙Hamiltonp2🔨💪❤🤙Mercedes toto ilave ❤❤❤
Bottas on fire! What a lap!I didn't expecting that to happen.Mercedes front row lockout,on this so clear "red bull track"?this season just gets more unpredictable every weekend,and with 3 race weekends ahead it will get intese...can't wait!
Max backing off the throttle when there's a car on front of him? Omegalul.
Roses are red, Violets are Blue.   Its been a while, since a Mercedes 1-2
Max crying at the end even though he wasn’t gonna get on the front row anyway 🤣
Verstapen : "unbelievable, such a dump idiot!" --- this guy is so disrespectful   of his peers drivers!!!  I wonder what we will get if  he wins the title this year !!!! I can't imagine the world if this coming from Lewis!!! And on top of that, this guy was voted as the most popular F1 driver!!! what a shame!!??
Bravo, well done
brilliant Bottas!
That Fangio award looks impressive! Well done, Bottas!
Sainz - Ricciardo - Leclerc - Norris, one after the other. That's going to be *chef's kiss*
Verstappen cant Drive he is always complayning about other People
Hamilton is right, Verstappen needs to learn some respect, calling drivers "idiot" all the time
Mercedes = SANDBAGGING
I guess Stroll had a drink
Just my honest opinion: Mercedes heavily changed the setup of the car between fp3 and quali, and it ended up with a surprise front row lockout. The only problem with this, is that they haven't tested that setup on the long run.. It's a risky move, they could have issues in the race tomorrow (as the setup cannot be changed anymore), something like tyres cooling/degradation, especially with a heavy load of fuel
Stroll not worth it
6:46 nice touch
Hope Mercedes can capitalism on the front row lock out.
Battery volttas
going into this quali with no expectations and getting a merc front row lockout was a nice feeling
That is some showing from Valtteri
This season is so wacky I swear
The is the last year we see Botas on pole 😂
The amount of time Russell gets in these highlights every week it's absolutely pathetic.....pushy  PR!!!!
Everyone: Mexico is a Red Bull Trac...... Valterri Bottas: SIKE..
I really hope perez wins, the fans will go crazy
Verstappen should shut his filthy mouth.
Just hope bottas is allowed to race for the win tomorrow, kinda doubt it tho
Did merc made the wrong choice on Bottas? Bottas showing his true pace now
Did merc made the wrong choice on Bottas? Bottas showing his true pace now
1000th
Traditions
Sainz Jr.: NO Power. No power. Pit Crew: Press the accelerator, Carlos.
We all know what Toto expects Bottas to do tomorrow. Let Hamilton pass and block Red Bull.
Well done Valtteri getting pole💪🏻🤩 Just ashame that we’ll hear the famous “Valtteri it’s James” line tomorrow during the race😒
Bottas is the goat
*_I think we'll get 20 finishers tommorow_*
Best case scenario for Verstappen fans: Perez P1, Verstappen P2, Hamilton DNF Best case scenario for Hamilton fans: Perez P1, Hamilton P2, Verstappen DNF
Merc really went "sike, you thought"
Hahahahaha.. all the hype on redbull and max for pole but where are they? Hahahahaha.. i told you guys this season mercedes and lewis are going to win again
Lance proving once again that he has no business being in F1.
Mad Max is going to crash into Hamilton
Why was max saying it was better to start at 3rd than 2nd ? Because , the one starting p2 usually wins the race
Bottas better enjoy every pole he gets, because this will be the last season he’ll see the front row….unless he returns to a top 3 team after his time with Alfa Romeo 🙄
These 2 are now very equally matched cars-mercedes and red bull racing; it is just about getting the set up right to extract the maximum; mercedes somehow got the set up right and the driver gave 110%!!! The Mexican circuit is amazing and is not easy to drive. Start is extremely important. If mercedes cars and get away nicely and prevent redbull undercut, the championship will be back to life in the last few grandprix again. Max VS LH
Incredible scenes from quali. Wow🔥🔥🔥
Tomorrow merc 1-2 for sure. All the fans can stop crying now, everything belongs to hamboy and merc, deja vu.
What a f..k is this season? I'm dreaming?
5:18 three Red Bull cars ruining each other's lap😆
Super love to Bottas 💙💙💙
Someone should check that merc car.. i smell foul play
Jesus christ Valterri and Lewis that was crazy. How many bags of sand did you guys have in your car yesterday 😂
Valteri it's James..
I was listening to this through the app then my chimney set on fire so I missed it
Basically poor luck and driver error caused redbull to just miss out, even then Mercedes are undeniably strong, gonna be an interesting race.
EMPIRE STRIKES BACK
First things first, credit where credits due what a lap from Bottas! He's been on fire since he anouced his move to Alpha Romeo. That being said I'm just curious where Mercedes found that speed all of a sudden? Up until Q2 they where pretty much 0.4s - 0.6s slower than Red Bull and in Q3 Bottas goes 0.4s faster than Verstappen, that's pretty much a second they found out of nowhere. Not only that, two weeks ago in the States Hamilton made a 18s gap to Verstappen just vanish in a matter op laps (I get that he had newer tires and all that but still). Now I'm not saying something fishy is going both Bottas and Hamilton are great drivers but you can't deny that they are looking so much quicker than before especially the last couple of races.
The first scene when the car crashed was awsome it was like in a movie
One of the quickest, yet one of the best qualifying ive seen this season
Ofc when Max makes a mistake, it’s always someone else being a “dumb idiot”. Such a lovable person!
Are we not going to say anything about Gasly?
Let's go Hamilton!!  🚥🏎🏁🇬🇧
Well, that was disappointing.
mercedes lucky ones more
i hope this ends with a 1-2 finish for mercedes instead of max making a comeback
Kinda sad to see how people hate on max, just because he sweared, like they don't want drivers to show emotions and passion. As if dumb idiot is the worst thing to say, whether it was checo or yuki
For people to suggest Max has matured a lot.... he must've been coming from a long way back
CARLOS SAINZ TRATO DE ARRANCARLO Y LO CONSIGUIÓ :D Like para el que entendió la referencia 👇
Did max say that at the end about Perez or Tsunoda🤔 please some answers!!
Perez has to work hard with qualis.
Most boring qualifying ever
James: _"Valterri...it's Ja..."_  Bottas: _"Oh f**k off James!"_
HaHa!!! F1 and Jackie Stewart so desperately wanted to give Verstappen that BS Fangio award...but Bottas had other plans. Lol!!!
Bien Valteri
No matter what happen tomorrow , i hope it will be a clean race . Otherwise sebastian wont come home for dinner , he has to clean the track afterwards
Redbull robbed af
Tsunoda idiot!!!
How consistent can Gasly be..
SHOW!
Really starting to dislike Max, he is so disrespectful. Definitely wouldn't represent the sport well.
that Bottas got pole was unexpected, but watching the Qualifying live was just incredibly boring.
Does anyone how many front row lockouts Mercedes have got since 2014
O H Y E A H B A BY!
Happy for Bottas!
Are Hamilton and Bottas both on 3 poles this year.? Is it the pressure?
Max cracking under the pressure😂😂😂
For Max, everyone is an idiot when he isnt leading P1
Hope Bottas wins
Bottas Pipped it!
Como siempre Checo hizo su tontería !!
I love how everyone immediately discounted Mercedes this weekend
Verstappen showing the world his class at 6:35     even he gets WC - still a loser imho. why roasting your team(mate) in front of the world?
from 6 tenths behind, to 4 in front. In short, a credible sport
Looks an easy Mercedes 1-2 finish for the upcoming race.
Brilliant lap by Bottas absolutely stop on.. now let's hope he doesn't get another penalty
6 aNd A hAlF tEnThS!?
Valtteri: to whom it may concern....I got pole 😅😅
Finns+altitude=pole!
Haven’t watched yet but COME ON CHECO
I start to believe that was not using the same engine than Hamilton before they evicted him. Now he does....
I think Yuki Tsunoda has made strides this season. He's closing on Pierre Gasly, who has been just unbelievable all season long, making his Alpha Tauri look highly competitive. I hope Yuki gets another season, as he has really showed an ability to learn, adapt and get faster. The Gaz Man deserves a proper drive.
Team orders tomorrow for Bottas?
I start to believe that was not using the same engine than Hamilton before they evicted him. Now he does....
Austin: “Mercedes has this” Mexico: “Redbull has this”
F1 grid viewed by Max Verstappen: 1: himself 2 … 20: idiots
Congratulations to Bottas
This Weekend in Mexiko „We Drive as Juan“
It's be ironic if Bottas were to, win this, Max 2nd Lewis third, oops no 8th championship for you son...
Mercedes cannot win only qualifying pace craps of jungle will lose when it matters
stroll is a huge amateur
Yes 1 and 2! ❤❤❤
Get ready for "Valterri it's James" on the first lap
Of I'm not mistaken i think button said yesterday in fp1 that the mercedes of bottas was sandbagging because he improved his time by a lot on a 10 laps used soft tyre. Please correct me if I'm wrong  Edit:If not of lol
When it mattered Max cracked under pressure as usual😄,love it!! Go for the Win Merc boys!!!🔥🏁
F in the chat for Perez, no Fs for Verstappen tho he deserves to mess up
Funny how Mercedes struggle all weekend then boom, power and speed from nowhere, they're cheats need investigating like Ferrari was..
LET'S ABSOLUTELY GO VALTTERI!!!!!!
mad marko intensified
did sainz forget that he was in neutral?
Bottas is on pole because he set the fastest lap.
6:38 was for checo or tsunoda?
Bottas is Mr Reliable 90% of the time.
Incoming ‘Valtteri it’s James’
Poor ferrari
I know I’m relatively new to Formula One but I’ve never understood why they just don’t let the cars qualify one at a time on an open track to avoid these issues. Will someone elaborate?
So excited for race day! This season has been one for the books; nothing short of surprises!
😏
The Mexican track in some ways is like Monza at certain parts :)
bottas needs to be tested for car DOPING....i mean where did that come from😂😂😂😂😂
Is it just me and Max, or does anyone else notice that pretty much the rest of the grid is comprised of idiots?🙃
Bottas really has been on some different porridge since the Alfa Romeo news broke
Max insulting his two redbull fellas
Come on Kimi you know they're always watching.
Karen Verstappen...
Go Valteri, all the way to the checkered flag. You'll probably get some team orders, but ignore them!!!!!
Que loucura
Verstappen showing his lack of class again.
Bottas will be a sore loss to Mercedes.
GOES FASTEST OVERALL
No one knows who has faults about Yuki and Red Bull's incident
the 2 sec watching video: did we get strolled?
Bottas is king 🤴
Everyone is a idiot to Max. But he is still the only driver to get kicked out of the podium 3 times in one season. What an idiot
Can anyone elaborate what Haas said to Nikita in Q1? And what exactly was said? I couldn’t quite understand the radio message
LET'S GOOOOOOO‼️🔥🔥🔥
Lance into the wall
Ah... a long straight leading to a 90 degree corner at the start of the race tomorrow.... what could possibly go wrong?
Hamilton just hours prior: 👁️👄👁️ sIX aNd A hAfl tEnThtS?!?1!?
Max. Classless......
I’m happy with botas getting pole and we all know he won’t help hamilton so it’ll be bottas max checo putting pressure on hammy
Who was the ‘dumb idiot‘ directed at?
Come on mercedes, get the podium today, beat the RB pls 😇🔥
Biggest surprise though: Gasly didn't qualify P6 😉
Why is it we never see the seven time world champion unless he makes a mistake.
lance strolled away!
6:24
who would have thought...this season is getting better and better
"sIxTh TeNtHs?!?!?!"
Will they swap battas pu again?
I love how people think that Ferrari engineers are dumb just because they heard a couple of words with no context in a quali highlights video... all these people have such an high self esteem 😂
It must be so cool to be Max Verstappen and find so much of what happens around him to be unbelievable. He must find the world to be so magical
6:31 Who is Verstappen calling an idiot?
Yuki has done nothing but hamper Red Bull…no way he comes back next season
No worries...Tsunoda will do favor for RBR tomorrow 😄
The only idiot is Verstappen... now I know what it means to actually hate a driver, this guy doesn't deserve a championship
Max being disrespectful as always when he loses🤣
How the tables have turned
“The track suits the honda power unit”
We didnt want to know how angry must be Helmut Marko with Yuki right know!
*James:* clears his throat 🤪
Max: "Unbelievable, Sergio's a dumb idiot"
6:36 honestly if lewis said this everyone would have lost there mind online.
WHY IS THE VIDEO QUALITY GARBAGE TODAY?
Where do I put my money on a t1 max vs Lewis crash?
Yuki is innocent  just unlucky...
Bottas!! Number 1, Mercedes better keep him if they want to continue their dynasty!
Mercedes, what a dominant car on this track! Great job Bottas
why is no one talking about this p5 from gasly,behind the 2 mclaren and the 2 ferrari in an alpha tauri 😳    impressive
Nice.
Er, did Max say his teammate is a dumb idiot?
EU ACHEI BRINCADEIRA O QUE A BAND FEZ NÃO TRANSMITIR A CLASSIFICAÇÃO DO GP DO MÉXICO PARA MOSTRAR A DESPEDIDA E O ADEUS DA CANTORA MARÍLIA MENDONÇA
It's gonna be a tough race for Mclaren tomorrow
YES BOTTAS double merc but bottasis infront, bet bottas gonna hear valteri its james as the race begins to let hamilton pass
Dont let this distract you from the fact that Barcelona blew a 3-0 lead vs celta.
I mean yuki distracted both Red Bulls
Daddy's cash running out of talent cash.
Maybe there both knew Crashstappen was coming up behind them so they moved out the way for him 😂
This track is awful
Man I was watching the odds for getting pole position here on Friday. Max had 4/6 odds lewis had I think 2:1, perez had surprisingly high odds if you ask me 10:1 (guessing because he is racing at home) and Bottas only 20:1. Then in Q3 proceeds and obliterates everyone and it doesn’t even seem like he’s breaking a sweat. I’m 99% sure both he and Lewis would have improved their times if they hadn’t learned what had happened ahead. Knowing that they were 1-2 I’m sure they opted not to push their engine any more than they needed.
I hope he didn’t said it to checo
I wonder if Bottas will take a random grid penalty for the race
Valteri it's James let lewis through into T1
Once again, the media had it all wrong. According to their predictions it was a Redbull 1-2 with Perez coming on top in front of his home crowd.
i love you bottas
Lance is very bad as a pilot.
So basically Merc tracks are now Red Bull tracks, and Red Bull tracks are Merc tracks now?
get in there Valtteri!!!!!!I do like this driver .he deserves more
Hamilton 🤡
I feel tommorow will be a great race with Max and Lewis fighting for first and Bottas and Perez fighting for 3rd
Fkok Alfha tauri 😡🤬🤬
tsunoda a disgrace to f1
Final corner needs a streetsweeping
Valtteri surprised me.
All a charade! Mercedes playing the” hurt “ Group in practice 1&2
Yesss go bottas .. let's keep this dual chapionship close to the end don't let max run away
Everyone debating if Max or Lewis will win the next races, but I Bottas just gonna win all of em
Why is one of the Mclarens on the miniature when they didn't do nothing interesting??
I am one of the people who’ve claimed that Max has been nearly flawless this year and that if all things were fair and equal, he’d be up35+ points. HOWEVER, today was far from flawless from Max, and once again, despite how much we love Checo the person, he’s just not a very rapid driver. But once again, if your a neutral, you could ask for something better.
These small gaps don’t like Danny Ric
From double front lock ups to double front lock out. Come on boys!
Ohh Max boy…you just sound like a spoiled brat…I used to be a fan
People blaming Checo and Yuki for Max not getting the pole are delusional, as simple as that. Yuki moved out of the way to leave room for Checo, but he lost downforce and also got distracted by the dirt, so he had to correct last second, it was just bad luck. Also, the Mercs were flying today, we don't know for sure if RB could've done better than 3-4.
Be interesting to see what  merc are like in Race trim… something tells me they cranked that engine up to get track positions
Sweet result
Great job for the 2 ferrari 👍
Mercedes literally had a front row lockout in Hungary…
Nem Hamilton nyert. 😉
Someone new to blame mr verstappen
Bottas doing what he needs to ensure a constructors, while the driver championship is still up-in-the-air
Viva Mexico  Your pole position driver  Bottas
Kkkkkkkkkk
Put Gasly in Mercedes and you'll see all records beaten.
Nene rompe papá paga
Did Max just call Perez such a dumb idiot or himself at the end?
Meanwhile the Ferraris disappointed again
Who he calling idiot this time?
Mercedes are sandbagging? Stop the CAP guys.  More like RB failed to lockout the front row. If it wasn't for Checo getting spooked we would have a different outcome. Go Mercedes!
Red Bull pace will win tomorrow
Didn't that happen to Alliott in the 80s?
They had a front row lockout in Portugal
6:06. Uh. Hungary.
This is what happens when you expect too much on rb, things will change.
GO MERCY GO!!!!
Embarrassing from Stroll
One lap andy does it again :)
What an upset, immense lap from Bottas
Yuki wasn't at fault, if you don't agree you're WRONG.
That tow on the long straight will be yummy
Oh the irony, tsunoda moves for perez, who goes wide, and in turn ruins max’ lap😂
Free Mercedes for commentator.......he so loves them winning.....
yes marcedes p1 and p2 yessssssss go mexico
Gooo Maxxxxx 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Valterri: Haha yes viva mexico!  James: Haha  Valterri: Whats up James?  James: Oh nothing man. Just congrats.   Valterri3 ………  (*we all know what will gonna happen if he stays in front of lewis*)
So bottas is towing sir lewis, but he get the pole, true power released
I am rooting for Mercedes this only and honestly wasn't expecting them get  anything close to pole. Where the heck did Valterri pull that lap time from. I guess game on tmrw.
I'm glad we lock out the front row, but you gotta feel for Max 🤦🏾‍♂️
Perez wanting pole: Mercedes and Max: "Lol NO."
Here for the Verstappen fans tears.
Revenge 😉 USA merc track : rb on pole Mexico : merc 1,2 😎😎
5:09 look at the Checo's POV, he just LOST IT on his own! yuki did not do anything wrong here. no dust no nothing
Come'on Mercedes 👊👊🔥🔥
How did you get so fast, Valterri?  Bottas: Tacos, baby, Tacos.
checo paso de ser el viejo sabroso a el pendejo sabroso :D
If verstappen is not world champion with 4 teamates including Bottas...
It was the 30 tacos for VB!
I love Bottas "ha ha" almost like a 🖕 lol
Mr Saturday stepped up well today.
Carn the mercs!!
In the very near future yuki is going to surprise the world
Starting on pole here actually might be a curse because of how powerful the slipstream is going into turn 1. In 2018, Ricciardo went from 1st to 3rd after the first corner, and Max went from 2nd to 1st and Lewis went from 3rd to 2nd after the first corner. Something to keep in mind.
"valterrie, it's James"
Hamilton brake checks Max. Meaning that he will not get anything
Awesome mercedes!!🔥
tbh i reckon verstappen will be happy that he isn't in second  because from third he can get a tow of bottas and try and get past hamilton and possibly bottas
It actually gives me a smile on my face to see toto so happy
Bottas is a rocket since He has no contract with mercedes XDXD
I get it’s his home race, but why are people pretending like Checo had a chance to steal pole his last lap? He was on pace to remain 4th.
I LOVE MERCEDES
Calling your team mate an idiot will definitely help team orders 😂😂showing his class yet again
This is why sprintraces lacks edge of seat power.  Takes the thrill and fun away.   This is more entertaining right? One lap qualifying should stay. Thats how F1 is.
Wow. This season is something else
I feel quite bad for Yuki, he’s just starting to feel at home with the car. He doesn’t need the ignorance from RB.
MV calling his teammate and Yuki idiots, well done Max it is classy to call the man in the next garage idiot, very classy!😤😤😤
Mercedes sandbagging much in Qualifying?
Enjoy your time Bottas
I want HAM BOT VER for tomorrow for exciting WDC. but I still believe redbull gonna win :(
Toto saying this is a difficult weekend then getting a front-row lockout screams the same energy as lewis saying my tires are gone then proceeds to win the race
Turn One will be the best of the season
Yuki destroyed both redbull
😂 come on Merc 💪😁
For Yuki this is one of his best weekend in Ff1, he just wasn't in the right place at the right time  :'(
It seemed Horner was right about Mercedes concealing some of their true speed. Can't wait for tomorrow!.
Bottas > Hamilton
Of course, Max is blaming everyone else as usual 🙄 It's always someone else's fault when he's not quick enough
Everyone is an idiot according to max. 😂
Mercedes na corrida vai sofrer com a temperatura
My prediction, Verstappen takes lead at turn 6,
Botas na corrida e horrible
Mercedes had a 1-2 in Hungary
My guys I just woke up expecting a front row lock out from redbull after fp3
Did max say something about checo when the tsuonoda thing happen?
*Let's Go Mercedes.*
as a ferrari fan and someone who would rather red bull and max win the title, this was a painful quali
Can someone please explain me why it is Yuki's fault?
Aston Martin should get an award for most underwhelming team of 2021...
Now this will be an interesting race
Carlos: No Power…  Engineer: Ok, slow button OFF
Nadie: Valtteri Bottas: "Viva México" 🇲🇽
If I were Bottas I won't play as a wing man here, Lewis better fight bottas this time, and Bottas must do everything just to.not let Lewis pass him...
Me: *sees danny ricc on the thumb* Maybe some last minute magic? Qualy round: *barely features him*
"Are you having a laugh?" "No, I'm not having a laugh!" End.
I was a bit sad when Checo had to abort his lap because of Yuki, but really happy for Valttieri, he was really of fire!!!
How Max is still in the title fight with a driver like Checo backing him up I will never know.
Finally. An race engineer for Lance who ACTUALLY cares about him. Glad he was ok.
Gonna be an exciting race boys
Last time rb got pole in merc circuit, now merc got pole in rb circuit
Pierre Ga5ly!
Max will have slipstream and the clean side tomorrow, easy...      I think.
Verstappen has the know how to drive but he just can not control himself insulting others. That doesn't make a great sportsman
Checo Perez shows us why he's the most overrated driver on the grid. He probably cost Max a pole position today.
i agree with verstappen!!!! perez is complete idiot ruining everything for redbull
Man this season just gets better and better.
porridge boss
Now that was unexpected
Idk why Tsunoda's rear was issuing smoke on that corner. This distracted Sergio as it must have looked as he had caught the grass or was about to spin off.
Honda masterplan.
Does anybody know why Carlos Saints had to be told to rev up?
Thanks Bottas I will remember you always for this qual,👏✌
Qué dijo Verstappen? xd
Red bull fans go cryyyy hard 😂😂😭😭😭😭😭 Mercedes the one and only winner team
Pinche Yuki...
Overrated Redbull
Well done Yuki, well done 🙏🏻
MAX!
Valtteri, this is James: Unfortunately we have to change your gearbox, thankfully Lewis' car is fine.
Tomorrow Sergio will either be leading or taking out both Benz at turn one The ultimate sacrifice will be made marko has made the order
Go Max ~
Mercedes back with the sandbags in practice 3 and go fire in qualifiying
Gonna be hilarious when both mercs run wide turn 1 lap 1
MERC!!!!!!👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
The Aston Martin of Lance Stroll....
Ez for VB🔥
Max Verstappen is now getting used to insulting Drivers and calling them Idiots whenever thinks don’t go his way, he knows there is never any outrage when he does that. He’s so rude.
Guys, hear me out alright. If Hamilton and Verstappen manage to crash into each other for the last five races, Bottas could win the championship. Just let that sink in...
Ocon in hungarian: First of many wins Also Ocon: not q3 at all
I don't think you have to cross Yuki, this is one of his best weekend in f1, he just wasn't in the right place at the right time: "(
Bottas seems unleashed after signing with Alfa Romeo 🔥🔥
Stroll was very disappointing. He had nothing to win. But he lost the car. For what?
Lets go VB77!!!!!!
Verstappen crybaby
Who did he call a dumb idiot his teammate
Mercedes found the sandbags. What a joke and the same one they have been playing all year long. Boring and yet another ploy en route to title number 8. Congrats to the W12 and not the drivers who have nothing to do with this. Half the field would be winning in a W12.
This Russell dude got some awfully big shoes to fill next year.
Max not winning fans out there by calling people idiot
What happened to Lando though
Bottas: "Oh yes, haha, viva Méjico!" Tomorrow after lap 1: "Valtteri, soy James"
"Valtteri is James" moment incoming tomorrow
Imagine starting last because of an engine penalty and still crashing your car during qualifying.
Can somebody explain to me why Max was so upset about whatever Yuki was doing? It isn't really obvious to me (I am still quite new to all of this)
Valtteri Valtteri Valtteri,.. Oh if Mercedes had given Valtteri a two year contract just one time , the World would have seen him win win win like he's driving now that he's more relaxed
where did Tsunoda find all of this speed!?
-U k lance? -Yeah -Ok 🙄 Boy you almost hear that eyeroll from lances engineer 🤣
Verstappen calling his teammate an idiot🤣🤣🤣
Max or Perez could’ve got pole if Yuki didn’t go off.
"Such a dumb idiot" I hope he will not be the next f1 WC. From my knowledge he doesn't deserve it ☺️
Max and Red Bull buckling under the pressure it seems
What maturity calling your team mate an idiot.
Agent Bottas will be instructed to take out Max Verstappen..
El chino Tsunoda arruino la pole de max y 2do chko. Que hacia ahi ese chino?
Bottas needs to be in a better team next season than Alfa Romeo
Really rooting for Bottas right now, the man's on a mission!
According to Max, how many idiots in the grid? Lewis, Perez, Ocon, Mazepin are who I can remember.
Y que VIVA MÉXICO!
Would max have the pole if yuki wasnt there?
Bye Yuki. It was fun while it lasted.
Valtteri Bottas muito confiante que pode ser campeão mundial nesse ano.  Será a zebra da temporada se isso acontecer.
Is anyone suprised??? Because i'm not. Why??? Because this is Mercedes. Best actors... for last 7 years. So why are you guys so suprised??? Maybe i wasnt expecting Valterri on pole but Lewis. But c'mon guys when Wolff said this is worst track for them then you expecting Red Bull on pole??? C' mooooon guys where are you living??? Under rocks??? So please dont believe everything what Mercedes saying or others saying just concetrate on yours opinions and facts. Just facts...
Max calling his teammate this way in his home grand prix. I'm hoping him to be DNF
Everytime you start doubting Mercedes they pull of something special, never underestimate Mercedes.
Sad for RB, elated for Bottas
Fangio's helmet!
BREAKING: Tsunoda to Mercedes in 2022
Yuki had no business ruining Red Bull's last lap attempt when he's starting in the back... Come on
Quali battles 2021 *Ham* 13 - 5 BOT *Ver* 16 - 2 Per Nor 10 - 8 RIc *Lec* 12 - 6 Sai Vet 11 - 7 Str *Gas* 18 - 0 Tsu Alo 9 - 9 Oco *Gio* 13 - 5 Rai *Sch* 17 - 1 Maz *Rus* 18 - 0 Lat Ones highlighted in bold are the teammates that out qualified their teammates for the whole season
I can't believe I didn't get pole position.
É uma pena a Band não ter transmitido o treino hoje.
Rest in peace  Marília Mendonça
This season is Been so unique in a weird way  the betting company's must be making  millions
Where are a type of tires on translation as old time?
Bottas let’s Lewis thru holds up max easy win for the champ
Red Bull fans... Please, please, please watch Yuki's on-board video. He went off the track to give way to RB. Please believe me before you say anything bad about him…😭😭😭 Best of luck to the two teams, RB and AT! With love from Japan!
I'm happy that Merc have the front row lockout purely because now they can't tell Bottas to run Max off the road lol
Valteri it’s Bond, James Bond, Hamilton is faster than you in the first corner.
I already see Verstappen and Hamiltons colliding in Turn 1
Out of all places to get a front row lockout this season, I wasn't expecting Mercedes to get it here in Mexico.
Doesn't matter  who's in front Max will win tomorrow 😌
F1 video editor, Lewis not being on pole: *plays only 0.27 seconds of Bottas' Fangio award footage* lol poor Bottas
What happend at Gaslys last Quali run in Q3? Why did he abort it?
Lets hope this race is close, cant wait
Well that was a surprise
Bottas dont you give up the lead... You go for the win tomorrow, despite what your team wants. 🏁🏁🏁
why is nobody giving Yuki any praise?? He did really well in fp3 and quali, shame he lost it in the last lap
Yuki's not really at fault here, his engineer told him late that perez was 4 sec behind where he's actually right behind him Edit : his engineer should've told him to push but mistakes happens
All new mercedes models come with sandbags as standard
Valteri: YESSSSSSSSSSS Max: UNBELIEVABLE!!! Lewis: …
Shout out to Tsunoda. Something's lit a fire under him since Texas....he's been doing far better.  _And no shortage of credit should be given to Alex Albon. He's basically Yuki's coach, now._
BRU HFUCKJ
I hope that i will one day race in F1
COTA, a Merc track: *Redbull pole* Hermanos Rodriguez, a Red bull track: *Merc pole*
Bottas new engine
This might be the worst track for a front row lockout, imagine the slip stram to the first corner, but this is thw bottas everyone wants to see
Sunday be like: El Valtteri it’s el Jámes
After quali Tsunodas phone: anonymous donation
Egh ehm Valtteri it’s James
So when will Bottas be letting Hamilton past?
I think the sound system in Mazepin’s car is draining a lot of energy. Turn off the techno!!
Who says this is a Red Bull track, didn’t Mercedes win here in 2017 and 2019? Or is a Red Bull track for pure pace?
First front row lockout? Remember when you commentated alongside Nico Rosberg in one of the most bonkers races all year? No? Ok then, Hungary 2021 is the race
Bottas is nailing it this year
I am rooting for Max in the championship and was looking forward to a Red Bull front row tomorrow, but actually this is way more entertaining. Seems nothing can go according to plan this season and I love it!
Everyone: How much for those bags of sand? Mercedes: Best I can do is front row lockout
Gasly deserves a Red-Bull seat, no doubt.
“Haha, he’s not too clever this guy”
Max has to pull out something special on Sunday. I generally believe the RB16B is faster but just a few mistakes in Q3 denied Max pole. It all comes down to the race anyway, that's where the points are.
Valteri its james
Fantastic news. I still expect Max to be sharp off the line so it’s going to be a very exciting start to the race.
Yuki holding up the 'wrong' group for sure. Language barrier I guess 😂
0:22 *The Peraltada Bites AGAIN!* That turn used to be Mexico's Wall of Champions.   It suddenly sprung back to life again, interesting...
Wow bottas was on fire🔥🔥🔥
Lap 1 tomorrow will be intresting, especially the start, since both Red Bulls will have a slipstream down to turn 1.
Merc 1-2 at a RBR-favored track, after they've been off the pace for all of the free practices... wow. This season keeps getting more hectic.
Bottas might need another new engine next race. Mercedes really cranking that engine really hard
Its a "Mercedes" baby...the best or nothing.
I really would like to see Bottas dominates the rest of the season.
Gasly will go bowling tomorrow
They need to clean this track next time before having the teams here
FIRE!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Well that was unexpected..
anyone else thinks that gasly is gonna pull a monza this race??
Not what RB thought would happen.
Fellow redbull supporters  we still got the race left many things can happen let’s keep our head up and hope for the best
Bottoms up for Bottas
I love how this season is so unpredictable. You never know how things will turn out.  Hoping for Bottas to win tomorrow and at least one RB to finish ahead of Hamilton so Merc can't tell him to move over for Lewis.
Get in there Bottas!
Verstappen.... Almost swear yet again...
With Bottas been the sacrificial lamb ,,,,,,,, again , it should be an easy win for old lulu ! Verstappen needs the start of his life to have a chance !
Who did max call an idiot towards the end?
What did he call his teammates idiot? what?
Carlos no power no power  Engineer: press the accelerator
Why did Lewis get booed again?🤣
P3 is the best place to start here, clean side of the grid and a slipstream down to the first corner.
Hah. Hah.
No need to change something on valtteri's car? Hmmm, that's odd
If it comes to Bottas taking team orders I have no idea what will happen. Very excited about tomorrow.
Gonna be one heck of a race
O Bottas não consegui manter o mesmo ritmo da qualificação na corrida, talvez vejamos amanhã uma troca nas posições entre ele e Hamilton.
The unexpected happened, we all wanted Perez on pole but Bottas does a "HERE COMES" And have taken pole
Nice to see bottas leaving Mercedes’ on a high   He’s been racing really well for the team in recent races and at times better than Lewis
I mean all that says is the they didn't care to overheat the power unit. They went full out.
I'm sleeping
awesome
"Six and a half tenths?!"
Dear Lord, is it too much to ask for a mercedes engine blowout and have checo win?
Race into turn one tomorrow is going to be epic you just know it  Two Mercedes  A red bull that has been strong in Mexico behind 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Didn’t expect to see Bottas up there. But he was on fire on Q3 and it’s gonna be exciting tomorrow! There are also a lot of penalties, so I‘m really looking forward what will happen!
Meanwhile in Mexico Yuki tsunoda is the most hated man in Mexico…
wow, increible alguien sabra a que velocidad van estos pilotos ?  Saludos desde sayulita
Tsunoda ruin the Red Bull Q3.😡
“You okay Lance?”  “Yeah..”  “K.”
Max casually lashing out at checo/tsunoda
Tsunoda will face Helmut Marko true power after this.
I swear this year is inverted like how tf did the ONLY Merc lockout so far this year come in MEXICO?? 😩
Fun fact: Verstappen's current race engineer, Gianpiero Lambiase (GP) was Perez's engineer back in 2014 at Force India
I love this Season cause it goes 📈 📉 📈 📉 📈 📉 📈 📉
Come on Mercedes I’m still backing Lewis for the title
What did Tsunoda to the Red Bulls 😡
Imagine they give Bottas another engine change penalty tomorrow 😅
We are nearing the final form of Bottas.
To whom it may concern, I need not the tow! Woo! -VB77
The mercs spend more time sandbagging than everybody else
"Yuki, it's Marko."
Never give up. What an amazing outcome for Merc, and BOT wow…In the form of his life!
Mexico GP
That must be the biggest sandbagging out of a team i’ve ever seen
I mean I'm disappointed about Max but Pierre top 5 always gives me joy
Qualifying
Mercedes just pulled a reverse UNO card.
58th
Don't worry it's going to be Max for the win, he won it twice right? And I think both occasions weren't on pole
That new engine is working superbly for Bottas..
"Such a dump idiot! 👶" - Max
Ah yes throwing the form book in the fire once again
So this is what it feels like to be early
wu tang..
Wow, that was surprising!
Seems like Mercedes took a little trip to the Mexican desert to refill the sandbags before this weekend.
Great teamwork from Checo during Q3
"This is our worst track on the calendar" said Toto Wolff before getting a front row lockout
Carlos: no power, no power.  Engineer: press the accelerator
And the Oscar goes to.... Mercedes
Everyone arguing whether Checo would give up first to Max, no one realized that Checo is slower than Max.
Set up for a great race tomorrow! Shoutout to Gasly, so so underrated rn
VB showing his worth once again 👀
Neither Verstappen nor Hamilton ... Bottas takes pole! What a great surprise and what a great race for Bottas! Congratulations!
Tsunoda Masterblan
King Bottas 🤘
Merc taking 1-2 at a historic red bull circuit, what a strange season..
Lol Checo choke as usual
Bottas🔥🔥
Mercedes being nowhere since FP3 and then suddenly getting a 1-2 is the most Mercedes thing to do.
Sad that today didn't work out for checo, but I hope he will have an awesome race tomorrow!
Probably most surprising qualifying result of this season
Viva La Mexico 🎉
Second
Let's go!!! Hopefully Lewis will win tomorrow
This was the most boring qualifying session i’ve ever seen…
Let's go Checo!!!
I wasn't expecting Bottas to take the pole but credit where credits due. He was on fire in Q3.
dom smith
I’m here quicker than Mazespin during a Safety Car Lap
Hope verstappen wins
해밀턴 우승하자 막스는  리타이어  하고

Bottas underrated
Most teams: Focusing on developing next year’s car  Mercedes: Focusing on developing their sandbags
