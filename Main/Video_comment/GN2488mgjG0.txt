Haaland scores against every PL team as City win at the Etihad!!! 😮😮😮 | Man City 1-0 Brentford | PL Highlights
Man
HAALAND🐐
ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY..expensive players buying their way to trophies. Nothing to do with Manchester..I'd prefer to say I supported a proper team than a fabricated one from abroad. Money has ruined the game thanks to Sky and Sheiks.
He just has to score an own-goal now. 😂
Steven Gerrard has lost connection from the servers
Empty seats
Jesus Christ, look at all those empty seats, I Wonder how they make any money..... Oh, wait
Not villa
FOOTBALL is the best
115 😂😂😂
those empty seats😂
Haaland is the best he has scored against every team1-0 city city 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
so pep no-one can replace sergio aguero huh, 50 goals later............
Jammy Man City win again. I’m convinced Man City must of paid that defender to slip and let Haaland score. Probably has him in his fpl team.
Brentford defender is begging on his knees to be popular
The errors, slips that's cost Brentford this season is crazy.
Is it me or is as on you tube getting longer?
Franks really has done an astonishing job at Brentford!
He had to slip
115 is the legacy
Foden should have passed, haaland knows it.
He’s supposed to score against every side… That’s his job!
They tried to compare that failure hojlund to my striker!
He's such an amazing player but for the life of me I cannot STAAAND him lol
Haaland has to be right up there with the greatest goalscorer of all time in my opinion that is
"THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK "?BY PROF WALTER VEITH POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH TRUTH ALWAYS WINS GOD SEES EVERYTHING 👀 🙌 🙏 👏 ❤️
Thr amount of luck Haaland gets with CB's falling over around him letting him through on goal, unbelievable Jeff 😂😂
Liverpool have like 8 key players out and are bossing it
Foden is actually world-class. Unlike Grealish and Saka, who are overhyped.
Two poor sides - looks like a championship game
Haaland is yet to score against mighty Luton Town.
Phil foden playng selfish there at the end .
I wonder how much city paid for that slip we all know they pay there way to the top
I support man city in the league and even I was supporting city aswell
Does he want a medal ? 🤣
Best player in the world, Mee!
not this season cause he was in salibas and gabriels pocket
Brentford defender saw the compilation of Haaland shrugging off defenders to the floor and thought "I'll do it myself, it's less humiliating"
Ye don't give Onyeka the chances to score. I know this from the Afcon with us(Nigeria)
please make it stop.
The amount of empty seats is staggering.
bernado is losing his hair that's tuff.
I was at the match it was so good
A game when Ben Mee is mentioned is like finding 50p down the Sofa  !
Booooooooooo Manchester City is rubbish Manchester United is better
That slip looked an awful lot like stevie g's
GIVE HIM A BALON DOR already
Haalands aura just made the defender get knocked out
Cyborg  ctid 😮
Scoring against all prem teams he’s played in a season and half is a ridiculous
Cheating city scraping through
Such a clinical finish from Haaland ...... that Brentford keeper had put up a defiant show, together with the rest of his defence, before Haaland finally found a way through.
Haaland did not score against luton
Haaland is a fraud
Where's the bloke?
I remember that slip hahaha Liverpool we are coming for you😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
Why’s there a woman commentator on this game but in women’s football there’s no male commentator?
115 times better than Brentford
Why is there a screeching female commentating on the mens game?
Haaland had a great goal they just need grealish on pitch
Champions of Europe & scrape 1-0 against Brentford 🤭
Defender is S…………😂
Top class finish
This female commentator has the worst voice ever. Grates your ears.
Flekken was quality throughout the whole game, best player on the pitch
Haaland chokes in the big games.
Why are the advertisements boards so big … the fans can’t see 😂😂
Wat about LIVERPOOL😊😊😊
Respect 😂
Let’s wait until the end of the season before we all get excited yes. And no, I’m not a City fan.
115 charges FC
It's like the commentators on these cartoon games.. Micky says wow look at that then the echo follows from him Pathetic really
wow he actually scored about time
You would think sky could afford to upload better quality video, 1080p doesnt cut it for me, youtube allows up to 4k, least we could see is 1440p
Haaland used intimidate! It was super effective!
Let's not forget they've been cheating since 2013
halnd well be losee
ben mee most underrated defender in this league
You can see Ben mee read that in real time, quality defending
Why do these highlights always leave out disallowed goals, they are still important to the context of the game
Best in the world 🌍
That’s where Halland is at his best  - in behind the defence
I think we all are getting bored with cheating man city now winning everything everytime, we all cant wait when they fianlly get relegated to make the league interesting again.
Well done from the man whose name is pronounced Horland.
Bro Haaland  is so strong that when he faces each other 1v1 he knocks the player out and scores
half man half machine, Erling Haaland, unstoppable. This man brought a revolution to a Man City side that was already winning domestic titles and could not win the big European trophies. Now with this guy on the team, City have won big trophies like the Champions league. But Im just confused as to how Man City paid this guy less than 100million and managed to sign him?😶
What a start from erling Haaland after his knee injury
Shittys luck will run out sooner or later.
Oil
That was class by Bobb
That was like watching a game during lockdown - atmosphere was awful 😂
unlucky Brentford
City only scored one goal against Brentford...😆
That slip was criminal 🤣
When city go one up there boring to watch
Don't you just love him...
The stadium is sooo quiet
I'm no Manc fan or shandy drinking southerner but that ref was terrible he ruined the game and Brentford's tactics prior to the gol were abysmal worst kind of football to watch. Glad Haaland the Leeds fan banged in that goal these small southern teams are crap to watch.
Useless commentators
Foden is outstanding. Watch the Wally from Watford play him out of position for England in the summer.
Bobb is some talent
Haaland has been pocketed by a few teams this season. He is no Henry, Van Persie, van Nistleroy or of that (they can do anything naturally and it looks fantastic calibre) yet.
TOTENHAM
Number of last men who just fall over when one in one with Haaland is almost shady
Citys defensive line is so high, easy to counter attack them
Imagine falling over and allowing Haaland to score
Brentford had the chances but failed
That defender has been terrible for Brenford
foden half turn TM❤‍🔥
Oscar Bobb the poster boy of Norway
Pep has lost it big time
Worst triple captain ever
Had to turn off the sound. This female voice spoiled all highlights pleasure! Disgusting!
The woman commentary makes every game hard to watch she does it for it’s awful, shocking and ruins the game
Flekken being statistically one of the worst GKs then turning into Prime Cech against us is such a pain 😂
Hi
That assist from Alvarez 🔥 He’s a better player than Haaland but some of you aren’t ready for that conversation
Another treble for City if they want it
Hasn’t scored against wolves
Barton is right. That female pundit is ridiculous.
GK has been criticised heavily lately. But I think he’s had a few good matches since I’ve been paying attention to him. Kudos.
I can’t remember many English players with a touch like Phil Foden down the years.
Haaland is the new Messi
Didnt Thierry do the same
Why do Brentford defenders keep falling over? Bigger studs needed? Too wet of a pitch? It’s happening to loads of teams lately
Cheating club! But everyone just celebrate them beating a club that plays by the rules!
Man if that akanji shot went in 😭
The pressure is getting to Haaland. He isn't the same and honestly his performance will keep dipping. I think it's time for him to move. He's already won three trophies with Man City what else is there for him.
Haaland is finally scoring goals without it being a tap in
600th comment
it actually looked like foden was celebrating instead  of asking for a  corner😂
Got lucky again with a defensive slip.
Foden is so good man.
Brentford deserved a point ..
Thank God man city drew against Chelsea
Can he do it in national league when found guilty
Anyone else getting weird screens on YT this morning ? ( 21 feb ) like minimised within the screen
If gundo stayed at citeh  city would be first
Ngl but tony is so overrated, he scored twice last season against city and Brentford beat them twice but scince  he is so overrated this season that is why city beat them twice this season
That slip is equivalent to Gerrards slip which lost liverpool the title
FFP City 1 - Brentford 0
Andrew Tate takes tips from Man City on how to get away with cheating. 😘🤫
Raggy city
Crap commentary from the chick.
Female commentator. About as exciting as the game was.
The breford player that slip became  prime gerrard😊😊
Wow man city actually cheated less than their opponents for once!
That was definitely City’s Gerrard moment that slip 😂😂
Foden is a great talent, city lucky to still have 11 players on the pitch to earn a win though...Rodri slips punishment constantly.
So has saka, wanna write a documentary about this?
Scores a lot of goals but damn he misses a lot as well, sure needs to be given a lot of chances - good thing he plays for City.
City are beatable. COYG.🙏.
City are cumbling. Haaland is so overrated.
Women commentators for women’s football!
Brentford defend like little girls. Bunch of Bambi on ice.
City aren’t blowing teams away like they did before, a small crumb of comfort as they wind up their title assault. They may well still win it but it will be really tight, maybe even last day.
Brilliant!
Treble winners, best manager in the world, best squad in the world, highest turnover in world football… still loads of empty seats.  You just know those 115 charges are genuine.
Wheres the bloke darlin
A point for Brentford would've been fair
Haaland is Great Job! Excellence ! Well Done! Man City is Victory & Final Winner Forever !!! 🏅🏆
Tony should of moved the free kick again
Their going for the league, and they still can't fill the stadium....
{ MCFC } When Erling is coming at U it's a Goal ⚽️ 🥅 ⚽️
He done slippy G.....ynwa! 😂😂😂😂
With the injuries we’ve got, I predict we’ll lose against Luton and that’ll be Man City for the title. I hope I’m wrong but the pessimist in me says otherwise.
Interesting season 3 teams in with a chance to win.
End  of  the  season Liverpool  92 City  87 Arsenal  83 United  73
Did Man C even step out of first gear?
Gifted.
Not very convincing from city again only won due to a slip, the away side had the better chances
Why are there always so many empty seats at the etihad???
Foden start to get really greedy
Alvarez is a madness btw
The Foden Turn. That’s that
Haaland fell off
Haaland is clear of hojlund. Let's just get that clear
Is there anything more exhilarating than Haaland sprinting and bearing down on goal? ❤
Fake cheating club
Foden is that greedy player on your team that never passes 🫣 clear chance for Haaland if he squares it 💯👍
But can he do it on a rainy day in stoke?
I can never understand why they congratulated Mee, it's his job to be in such situations as to aid the keeper if the right scenario presented itself, and he did a goal line clearance, yes and what, ? It's his job and they still lost so everyone congratulating him was for nothing, just an ego stroking exercise
The way Haaland finishes with the side foot past the keeper is a work of art!  It’s just always so smooth and hit hard! 🔥🔥
In the words of rio! No one turns like Foden!
City should be scoring more
Nah brentfond defender had one job bro
Haaland thought he was martinelli 😂
Haaland hasn't scored against spurs 🎉🎉
That slip was heartbreaking as an Arsenal fan. 😅
I counted 4 moments of brilliance
How did they only score one on Brenford😂
Why is there screeching instead of a commentary? I prefer the SPFL no commentary just the crowd
Brentford when for the goal and Haaland did the business. So naive
Haaland is a freak of a player ...we restricted City to Barely anything in comparison to usual and he still managed to stick 2 past us and he's clearly on another hot streak.
Can’t fill the ground, embarrassment
Halaand didnt even score against Luton town 😂😂😂
Foden is deadly when he makes those turns
This oscar Bobb looks top class
Ben Mee is him
Tell you what? Those missed chances? Liverpool bury those! Arsenal bury those! What is up with City this season! Where’s our clinical finishing gone! Season after season City didn’t give the opposition a sniff of a chance, now they’re giving teams too many chances!
Penalty to Rangers!!!
Man City lost to Wolves this season who themselves lost to Sheff Utd.  Gee they must dreading their trip 2 Bramall Lane!
Anyone notice when city aren’t winning they end up getting a penalty, they never get red cards even for kicking out I.E. jack grealish on Dan burn last season, they get the softest penalties like against United, or someone slips miraculously as there one on one… something sketchy going on and that’s without the 115 charges you think they’d be anywhere near where they are now if they hadn’t cheated for however many seasons they did…
It is obvious that there is tension between Haaland and Foden, and this is not good for the results they don't pass to each other when they suppose to
RIP fellow triple captainers.
bobs decision making in the final third  is amazing
everytime haalands 1v1 his aura just knocks the defender out and away
Why do defenders always slip or fall in front of haaland I know he's scary but come on
Where's the disallowed goal???
From the get go of the video that was a super Through ball  but couldn't finish he's dinner given to him 😮 if that was Ivan that's Inn he made it too easy for the keeper should have been top corner
They was very lucky
"finally scores" as if hes not ripping it up😂
One team constantly attacking and the other parked in and around their pen area. So boring. Nobody is talking about Brentford as relegation fodder despite being on a terrible run. Terrible football team.
Treble winners, and how many empty seats lol
BTEC Hojlund...
Slippy g vibes right there
Wow brilliant 3 points for ffp fc
How can anyone comment anything other than the female commentary, I literally cant watch it.
If this was a boxing bout, the underdog put up a brave fight. Tested the superior fighter at times, gave the neutrals a good value for their money. Ultimately though, the superior boxer saw an opening, smelled blood and well..Landed the telling shot(s).  Against this type of team, you must, absolutely must, put them to the sword and take every chance you have and convert it into a goal. Trouble is, this side is so good even if you do go a goal or two up early on - they'll just go up the gears and remind you (and the rest of the country) why they're Champions of England.  Favourites for me to win the league (once again). What would make the title race epic is if both Liverpool and Arsenal get some sort of result against Man City in their meetings.
If that was Saka you’re looking at 2-0😶‍🌫️
Haarland scores 1 goal and everyone thinks he's Messi 😂😂😂😂
115 charges
😴
He's Always Scoring
I WAS THERE!!
Brentford unlucky to lose, defended well for the whole game and then one unlucky slip & they’re beaten. Tough to take but they can be proud, gave the best side in the world a good game and made them work for it.
Paid actor, what’s he playing at😂
Defender saw Haaland and pooped his pants, aha
If foden truly is that future balon dor winner that everyone says he will be he would've buried that🤷🏾‍♂️
Get in manchester city,love you
I can't believe how BRENTFORD didn't come away  with 3pts. They deserved it 👏
Foden can do things saka could never is crazy
Haaland has conquerors haki the way these defenders just fall over when it’s 1v1😂
not impressed at all with haaland
haaland actually has some insane aura this guy makes defenders slip or drop without having to dribble them at some weirdly high rate lmao
School boy commentating is painful
Arsenal fan here. Oscar Bobb looks like a baller
I must admit it was great defending by Brentford Nylons!
Brentford was robbed 😂😂
the corrru[pt in FACE     ;]]] W9ITH LAST TEAM
Flekken is in the form of his life.
As a Liverpool fan I'm a lot less scared of Man City than I was before.
what is these players deliberately throwing them selves to the ground it's getting a joke now no wonder he's getting all these goals brown envelops are due 🤬🤬
Had to watch on mute, commentator poor
Arsenal go in to win premier league Easy! Come on you Gunners 🫡👊✌🏽💪
the slippy g effect
If any of you remember, Haaland had a bad run similar time last season, but came back strong towards end of season.
Phew.
Ben Mee… exceptional goal line clearance.
woman commentators 😴
Great to see the attendamce record being broken at the Etihad 0:00
Thanks City, from a forest fan all the best for the rest off the season hopefully see you next year 😊
Ben Mee… WOW
"oh jesus" when akanji had his shot 🤣
Finally! After ALL those years!
Another female commentator ruining the game.
Cmon blues 💙
Irritating female commentator - kept stating the obvious, no insight whatsoever..
Man City - De Bruyne = Tottenham  Literally they got lucky if defender doesn't slip, Haaland doesn't score and it ends goaless.
The fact that City could only manage one goal at home to Brentford highlights how good Liverpool are.
Are you Gerrard in disguise lol
Flecken is a super goalie. Always coming up big for Brentford. If or when raya comes back im sure flecken will start
Thanks for nothing ajer 🙄😑
115 charges FC
Brentford defender got payed off
Manchester shitty cheating yet again to scrape a win against brentford.
Manchester shitty cheating yet again to scrape a win against brentford.
A little trivela would have done there because you’re not gonna be able to get your hips across in that position
F
Owie my ears 🔇
This slip looks similar to the one Gerrard did😢😢
To only conceded one goal against man city isn’t bad
😂😂 sky sports trying to make out it was a close game
Proper finish
Walker will never learn. If that guy would have trapped the ball he would have done completely what every other opposition forward has done against him this season. We're lucky!!
Haaland is finished
foden should have passed it to halaand 2:46
haaland finally scores full stop
Empty seats show why City will always be a shite club
Man City best team in the world
City should win the title but who knows.?
💙💙💙💙💙
Omg he finally scored against BRENTFORD 😂
Lucky win tbh
Didnt know gerard was at brentford
Only winning 1-0 lol, poor by city, expected 4 or 5
Bobb is a real talent 💪
The whole league is tainted until city are relegated
That touch from Oscar Bobb was exquisite 1:34
Really a slip…
Did city supporters know a game was one 😂😂 deary me how many empty seats
Good highlights, poor commentary
How to turn off the commentary???
What a title race this is going to be !
Haaland is inevitable !
Scoring a goal after missing 3 shots last game is crazy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Foden is Awesome when he runs with ball.
Galchester City to the World ❤🎉❤🎉
Foden on the half turn is a thing of beauty
I expected Brentford to go straight down when they got promoted to the PL. They are a breath of fresh air.
Man City will beat Liverpool at anfield
Is there a sniper in the crowd? Why does every defender slip in front of haaland 😂
Man City continue to be the luckiest team to ever exist. CB literally slips and falls over to let Haaland score 😮‍💨
it would help if defenders didnt gift the guy easy goals
One cruel mistake undos all the hard work. They were fortunate tonight, but they will come unstuck for sure.
The pundit saved the useless commentator...
The title is staying in Manchester
💙
I will send you a picture when you come in and get me this o and I'll send it out
Nunez would have lobbed the keeper!
Rumour has it ben nee is still down on floor 😂
once i heard the female commentator i had turn it off
Fantastic title race.  Fundamentally between three teams, Liverpool, Man C, and Arsenal.  Brilliant league. I just feel sad for the rest of the teams - almost like the 'whipping boys'.  Makes you feel sad for teams coming up from Championship.
Is this highlight speeded up or are they actually running that fast?
Chelsea are gonna get better and better a trophy 🏆 team no doubt about that fam ⚽
City play the most boring football no wonder why the ground is empty 😂😂😂
Haaland is a one season wonder...
Finally? It's literally his 2nd season in the prem 🤣
Man City fans still practicing social distancing? 💺😷 💺 😷💺
That defender should of just grabbed the ball with his hands taken a red and prevented a goal.
You’d think Brentford hammered us watching this , sky bias again
"OsCar B0bB sKilZz" "OsCar B0bB sKilZz" "OsCar B0bB sKilZz" - yet nobody is pinpointing that as soon as that ball is on the way to him, Mee is pre-reading and darting to the line, and actually gets the clearance. Proof people only give a toss about strikers. smh
How utterly boring Man City have made football
The etihad is never full 😂😂😂
We all know the real hero was Flekken
This game could have easily ended something like 3-2
It's so annoying when a title rival gets the win based on a mistake by the opposition (Arsenal fan here).
If i was the defender id fall cuz im not trying to end up like kimmich
Brentford shouldve won this i wonder if ivan had a wager?
Haalands aura just made the defender get knocked out
Taking haaland down is better than trying to keep up with him 😂
The Brentford defender just slippy Gd Liverpool’s chances of winning the league. As good as city are, these recent performances aren’t very convincing but knowing them, they’ll go on an unbeaten run to win the league. It’s either them or Liverpool (Klopp’s farewell - Would be a cinematic ending). Arsenal been banging goals but I still don’t know after last season.
1:31
There’s problems at city which makes this title race interesting
If Man City win by a point or 2 then that slip could be costly like the Gerrard vs Chelsea slip in 2014
Haaland best striker after Berbatov💀
Please stop this awful commentary
The Phil Foden shoulder drop gives me the James May fizz.
This was parking the bus on another scale. Typical Jose Mourinho "classic" tactics.
Foden gives Me David silva vibds
Financial doping cheats win again.
Finally? 😂
city gonna win the league again
FINALLY HE SCORES AGAINST BRENTFORD! WOO I WAS WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
As good as a result this was I feel were only playing at 50%.   Haaland and the rest of the attackers just need to sharpen up on the finishes if we want to win another treble.
Couldn't believe my eyes  a goalkeeper dives and catches the ball ( like they used to do before they were coached to parry  the ball and give away possession) whatever next
I thought the slip was a defend with hands
Hallaannnnnd
Plastic cheats! How many empty seats??
Will city ever fill their stadium lol
Match fixing in it’s finest
I support the brilliant blues
Foden is clear of Saka
Very interesting title race this is going to be
You missed the highlights from Doku
Some title race this is turning out to be. Still think Arsenal and Liverpool both currently look better than City.
Empty seat galore 😂  Such a tragic "fan base" good few thousand of those already there with free tickets 😂
I dont think there's a Favourite to win it this season. The prem a gift that keeps on giving.
Such a tap in merchant only thing he can score is tap ins
foden really should have passed that last chance, no need to be greedy
Man city are so lucky to have haaland respect 💙💙💙
one against the mighty brentford
Had to watch this game on mute for obvious reasons, thanks Sky
imagine celebrating a struggled 1-0 win against Brentford and thinking you're still in the title race because you're in 2nd place, that was your game in hand and the team behind you by only a point scored 11 goals in their last 2 games (both away btw). The league is fully out of Citys hands this year! LMAO
Thank god that defender did a Steve g for the haaland goal
Man city are one of the most boring teams to watch
Man City grinding out wins when it matters the most! Acceleration to the league title now
Defender done a steven gerrard 😂
Haaland what a player
💙M💙A💙N😁C💙I💙T💙Y💙   WELL DONE , CITIZEN'S YOU HAVE DONE US PROUD. OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE!! THE 3 POINTS WHERE NEEDED AND YOU DELIVERED A EXCELLENT BIG WIN FOR US 💪💙 .   🔥H🔥A🔥A🔥L🔥A🔥N🔥D🔥   NOT GONA LIE THE MATCH AGAINST CHELSEA I WASN'T TO HAPPY WITH THE VIKING, BUT IT JUST SHOWS HOW DANGEROUS HE COULD BE IN THE WORLD OF FOOTBALL ONE OF THE BEST STRIKERS ⚽️🥅 KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 🏆💙
He didn't have so many attempts, that the title had to show finally. I think it was his fourth attempt. With the previous one being him returning from injury
Ajer is worse than rob holding. Absolutely shocking defenders.  Do all the hard work for 70mins to concede like that.
They can only win by one goal not looking good
Haaland has scored against every premier league club he’s faced.. he’s not even played 2 full seasons yet. 😮 crazy
Woaaaaah that skill from Oscar bobb was mesmerising hand on heart if that ball went in it would of got so much attention
Flekken is literally saving Brentford from relegation this season.
Now this is a very intresting season first 57 points Second 56 points Third 55 points
haaland wouldve had a brace if foden wouldve passed
That city defence is having a bad day against any team who have decent forwards
Haaland has the best minutes per goal ratio of any player to compete in the champions league scoring on an average of every 64 minutes, fastest player to 10,20 and 30 Champion league goals most of these broken before joining city, Quickest and youngest player to reach 50 goals in Bundesliga history, broke the epl top scoring record for 1 season in his first season  Ronaldo: Minutes per goal or assist at 21 was 156.  Messi: Minutes per goal or assist at 21 was 103.   At 22 Messi  had 92 goals and 46 assists in 200 games while Haaland had 187 goals and 44 assists in 236 games  He offers a lot more the tap ins and if scoring them was so easy every striker would do it  Haaland has played most of his career in weaker teams compared to Barca and Man United playing with the like of Durtmund until he joined city  This dude can reach any heights
Brentford deserved something from this game. City are looking shaky; not title-winning material

Sky uploading faster than my dad going out for cigarettes.
Please no women doing commentary on men's football.
EARLY AS A MAN CITY FAN
That Brentford defender had 1 job
Na they already posted it
Haaland tested “Mee” a lot recently with those misses, glad he’s back on the sheet.
C'mon Liverpool
Nunez clear
Slipping in front of Haaland is basically on the same level as robbing a bank in broad daylight
Don't support city or Liverpool but when it's crunch time the 2 best teams in the country. City going win it. City 2nd arsenal 3rd.  4th up for grabs man u and Hojlund looking strong.
Haaland reminds me of one of the henchmen from Die Hard.
fricking oil money heh?
Empty seats 😂😂😂
Marcus Rashford is the greatest player of all time. He has the speed of Ronaldo, the dribbling of Messi and the grace of Pele. He is worth at least 800m.
Didn’t deserve it
So lucky today if ajer doesn't slip its 0-0 Brentford did well
Booooooooo for Man City winning but well done you manage to get the double over Brentford this season
Finally haaland didnt miss that many open goals for once! 😅
This is going to be one hell of a title race....13 games left 2 points between the top 3
BIBI at creams
Lol😅
Brentford defender on a payroll.
Now i know why its called the empthad
Every like this comment gets I will do 1 push up 👇
2 points separating the top 3… gonna be a very intriguing few months 👀🏆
Anyone else want sky sports to like our comments
Now that city have played and WON their game in hand the title race starts NOW‼️
Think Ben mee needs an England call up
Its a shame Haaland was in Disasi's pocket on Saturday....
Its nice winning 4 PL titles in a row Arsenal were never in it 🤣🤣
Haaland is back
Ben mee is the best cb in the prem
👍
Hojlund clear based on form
Manchester is blue 🔵🏆
Oilchester city stadium looking full for once 😂
