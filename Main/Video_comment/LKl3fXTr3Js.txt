0:35 scared the dug I laughed so loud there.
i love him so much
Thank you for this important taxonomic work
Dantes has no filter istg
In Australia, it's genuinely a practical haircut that keeps the harsh sun off a farm worker's neck and also his forehead, while shaving the temples and ears so he can sweat. In Australia, you can buy sun hats shaped like mullets for those who don't want to cut their hair in a way that looks ridiculous.
Cultural observations on people who pepper their sentences with bro and/or bruv, even though it's not part of their cultural identity.
Quick, make him a Professor of Anthropology!!!!
As soon as I crawl out of my Camaro, I’m gonna hafta straighten you out.
Mullet is an old celtic/iberic cultural thing.  It is mocked by idiots ashamed of their origins.
'I've got an Ape Drape--yes I do They're giving them to anyone--that means you!'
Mullets were rife in the 80s because people couldn’t afford haircuts so they cut their own hair. The fact that people pay money to get a haircut they could have done themselves is hilarious.
"The only skater in the skatepark who wasn't a child" - can relate LOL
More I see of Frankie, more I'm convinced he's an actual genius.
How fucking dare you 🤣🤣🤣
You grow out your hair just a little to much and then you get slandered
And there was me thinking that a Mullet was only worn by Mohawk Punks who couldn't afford hairspray or gel.
Any dude with a colorful mullet veritably takes it up the butt, and i don't even mean that in a hateful way.
Mullets
Mullet should be iconic of Australia
Should have gone to east Germany
as a guy with a neon green mullet, you are correct, i am broke
Huh...I think this has opened my eyes that aussies are just redneck brits.  In the U.S., we have all of them in the same country; perhaps your separation policies are a better idea.  They don't get along very well with the liberals...and neither of them get along with logical people that just want to live a reasonable life.  Anyway, I've been seeing a lot of ultimate mullets in town lately...on high schoolers.  It's kind of disturbing.  Google "ultimate mullet" and that's pretty much it.  You're right about the lethality, they almost kill people with how they drive every day.
🤣
in australia we just call it hair, mate
2:43 ok but why colorful mullet cute?? 😢
Last time I was in Australia I was at a beach-side bar and there was a guy there mid 60s sporting a Hawaiian shirt and a long silver mullet. It was glorious. Blowing in the warm breeze while he moved from table to table, I could see he was very popular with the ladies, I just could not compete, by comparison I was a real short-haired loser.
You should make this videos into infographics. I'll take my time to collect them as cards or something.
Coloured mullets ... nature's red flag
those were actually all really nice mullets. very inspirational
“The only skater in the skate park who wasn’t a child” 🤣 I’ve seen these mullet dudes irl
You need to somehow score one of these with Politicians.. I think your observations would be powerful enough to actually affect change.. no lies either lol
I only discovered these videos recently but I love them!! So funny and entertaining 😁
how was the tinder mullet guy a mullet? that was like the opposite
The mullets are moving in. There goes the neighborhood again.
No mention of its big thug brother, the skullet.
Mullets are the symbol of followers.
The mullet is the most appalling haircut ever created.
this guy is a legend
wheres the women??
very informative mate. If I see a mullet, pull it 😂
This g is a social genius ! :33
Business in the front and party out the back
This comment is buried deep in the mullet comments
Make a video of supreme
In German they are not very imaginatively known as Vokuhila which is short for vorne kurz, hinten lang (front short, back long)
If you want to see mullets, come to America 40 years ago
Those mostly aren't mullets.
Franky knows his mullets well - recon he is a ex mullet man  or researched topic well before let’s his grow 🤟🏼
No mullet and vest combos? Sorely disappointing.
How fucking dare you!!! Lmfao
Who knew mullets are popular in the Republic of Ireland... It truly is a place time forgot
colorful mullet earned my like
Mullet’s are iconic in American culture. Perhaps you aughtta do a contrast and comparison of Irish and American mullet wearers. Please see Joe Dirt and old television episodes of MacGyver for a reference.
Is it a requirement to have a scraggly mustache when you have a mullet?
I would like a cultural observation on certain types of university students. How about law? Because those guys suck.
MuLlEtBrAiNs!
I’m so in love with the guy with the tender mullet ❤😂
hello i'm offended
Ginger Mullet is living in 2123
@KurtisConner
That is one ugly hairstyle
As a mulleted individual, I can say.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LGM82uPuvA
Nah this chanel is gold 😭
Accurate
amazing video. used to date someone with a mullet. now I wish we would still be dating solely for the purpose of sending this video 😄😄
where do you find the mullets?! we do nut have mullets here in germany
the only haircut thats worse than no haircut
The colorful mullet is against capitalism because they’re broke
i leanred much science thank you, didn't see the rat tail variety in this field study tho
i hate living in australia
Mullets look terrible on everyone. It's remarkable how people are choosing to look awful to keep up with a social trend.
Please do one on mask wearing sheep fearing folk
mullets should be illegal
"Im single, get in the car".  Stealing that.  And growing a mullet.
Bro you haven't seen Tim Hensons mullet
I shamed the mullet right off a guy once, then I grew a mullet to show my white trash dominance, then he grew his mullet back, and we braided our mullets together, had a butt baby, and his name was kid rock.
I've just stumbled onto your observations and you have something man! You're skilled hahaha
1970 called it wants it haircut back
I'm aussie and im telling you most of the hair cuts he has shown are not real mullets
Next do "Cultural Observations: People that really want attention and "money for coffee""
Subscribed you don't have to say hello
this is weird.. i just went to the barber and got myself a mullet.. how does youtube know?
all of these guys chopped off their mullets shortly after
Is todays Ireland actually full of mullets? You would struggle bigtime to gather even a few in most developed, educated, modern cities. That's why it's easy to find mullets
I beat a bloke who had a mullet in my last match lol
Where all the Nigerians?
I have colorful mullet and wear my Docs daily and I've never had a more accurate horoscope than this absolute roast.
The guy doing the piss-taking is a cause for the piss to be taken within the first place. 💯
Do dreadlocks!
First guy was sporting a Clarkson waterfall.
I have nothing to add to this conversation
I live in Australia... it's like every second chav has a mullet and a stache. It must the the Vegemite
If you're not a rugby player, what are you thinking? They were shite in the 80's and they're still shite now
Yep.... This is shit....🌼 Really wouldn't be something a Trinners winner would produce.....
Seems like the Mullet and the attempted moustache are a symbiotic relationship.
Me with severe social anxiety and a mullet: also not speaking during conversation
Me with severe social anxiety and a mullet: also not speaking during conversation
Mullets are hot
0:24......feck me, that's a full on ginger mullet. He definitely has nothing left to lose.
I didn't realise that there are so many young men wandering the streets of Ireland looking like 70's porn stars. Bizarre. Good work.
lost it at "how fookin dare you" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Some ppl be hating on mullets but lowkey they just mad they can’t grow one or it doesn’t look right on them or dont have the confidence. Mullets are badass 🤘🏼😎
As an Australian I can tell ya these mullets and the blokes wearin em are piss weak
It’s not mullet genome but mullet phenotype but whatever great vid regardless, 1:39 #mullet43v3r
Business out front, party out back.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I had no idea the mullet still existed. 14-year old me would have been proud.
Their patron saint is Joe Dirt.
Please bless more people with this oh mighty algorithm 😂
0:53 is that a young kenny dalglish? fuckin ell didn't know he could time travel.
These are great
this feels like a cool show, I just wish the host spoke English so I could understand it
Now do one on white AF1
It's too bad you don't have a Chevrolet Camaros over there.🤣
Business in front party in back. I think there's a website a mullet spotter.
“Experimentation with MDMA during their gap year has rendered them docile” is such a funny line already but combined with the Attenborough like delivery it’s hilarious 🤣
Against capitalism bc they’re broke 😂😂
🇦🇺 🇦🇺 🇦🇺 🇦🇺
Coming from a Candian hockey family, our boys /men gave been wearing mullets for 4 decades
Haven’t laughed this hard in awhile, terrific stuff!
HE SECRETLY WATCHES HIS BEN SHAPIRO VIDEOS😭😭 I'm subscribed
the tender mullet has strong pheromones HHAHAHAAHAHA
LMFAO
I’ve learned so much
The mullet is the most practical haircut possible for various activities including cycling, & fighting with a sword, because it avoids obstructing your vision & hearing while still keeping the back of your head nice & warm. Society's scorn at the mullet can be seen as a test of loyalty: not wearing a mullet shows that you are willing to obey society's will over your own even where the former is vainn & absurd and the latter rational & practical.
I think I look good in a mullet and a smart bowler hat. Unfortunately, the last time I cut my hair into a mullet, my mother threatened to disown me unless I shaved it all off.
Love the tinder mullet guy holding in laughing and crying at the same time
There's two types of TV and film plc lecturer who will grade frankies pieces one as high art documentaries and the other as bleak abstractions
😂😂😂😂😂
Had one as a pandemic souvenir of hair, got it chopped when I looked around the barbers and everyone had one, seems like I turned that barber into a butcher, a bit against his will, barber said "well, have a nice life..." after
I did a report on mullets back on 9th grade around 2004. The most common mullet is the Pontiac mullet. The rarest mullet is the frollet, the Afro mullet
Do the Nike Dunks next plssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
all true, i used to have a mullet for a joke
I appreciate the 2:1 ratio in these
As a doc wearing, skating, colourful mullet kinda guy im very confused with myself
“Mullet!” Genius 😂😂😂

0:30 ok! I died from ROFL 🤣
Winter beanie in the summer always pisses me off.
Will gladly pay for your trip Down Under for research purposes, mullets are truly out of control down here. 90% of male high school students have mullets at the moment.
You should do one on people who wear Air max trainers
The distant cousin of Napoleon Dynamite.
Subscribed yesterday. Your shit is more addictive than gear ya mad bastard ya.
They think having a mullet is a successful contribution
@theovon
you will blow up soon
these are gold 😂😂😂
As an American it's interesting to watch these. Stuff like the Doc Martens don't have any cultural significance over here. When you take the object out of the picture it just makes it clear that it's just a means for people to relate to each other. Which makes the interviewer seem a bit salty and makes the criticism seem like defensiveness. But it also makes it clear that the interviewer and the kids in the Doc Martens and what not are part of a social game, like we all are, and for me that means you can play the game in a way that is useful to you or you can let it ruin your day. You just got to figure out what it means to you. Personally, I want to care what other people think about me and share love but other than that a lot of it is noise.
Some people think that mullets are cool, but in reality, they are a fashion disaster. They are an outdated and unflattering hairstyle that should have been left in the 1980s where they belong. In fact, the mullet is often used as a punchline in jokes because it is seen as so ridiculous. So if you want to look like a fool, go ahead and get a mullet. But if you value your appearance, it's best to avoid this hairstyle altogether.
I just found my new favourite YouTuber
Mullet Brain is now my band name so thank you and I have copy written that!
Hahahahahaha amazing
2:57 Skaters caught a stray 😂
... Is it wrong I kinda want a mullet now?
As an Australian, they belong to us. Also they became to prolific at my highschool the school banned them and the uniform code has mullets as banned.
Can we get a CP Company video?
i love how he bullies his interviewees and they just accept it with a smile on their faces
I’d like to think the people in this video saw the light and cut off their mullets immediately after the camera stopped recording
You forgot the ladies mullet.the Femullet pronounced fem-u-lay.
Mullet + northface = deadly combo
love this!!!!
That “how fucken dare you”💀
I can’t believe mullets are back..........why?...why
If u put the playback speed to 1.25 it actually sounds normal and I can’t go back to actual normal now
Brillant
I went to Australia and came back with a mullet. People wear them there because kangaroos won’t attack you if they think you don’t have a brain to chew on.
Bro you are consistently hilarious!
i see lot of mullets on white kisd specially on highschool
Gold
"The Iguanas of the Mullet world" 🤣🤣🤣
This guy is like the Regular Car Reviews YT channel but for real life.
I had to listen to 3:38 so many times to hear it in English. I thought he was speaking in German or Icelandic 😂
You're gonna pop off if you keep up with this kind of video mate
The North Face mullet….
Especially when paired with a moustache, the aesthetic reminds me strongly of the Dutch movie New Kids 😂 (Dutch counterpart of chavs)
Do one on tattoos please!
amazing series truely eye-opening
The guy in north face jacket without skin-fade, but with mullet instead is definitely a glitch which i didn't expected
The offense taken when the subject does as much as breathe
Can we get comments on Nike Air Force 1’s? There’s simultaneously nothing that needs to be said and sooo much that needs to be said
if a man is above 35 and has a mullet with a tash, then he most likely is a 🅿️eeD⭕
#endmulletboys
Posh boy wankers in England
As a ginger, I'd be interested to hear what observations you have about my people.
Against capitalism because there broke 😂😂
These are all so good
“The colorful mullet is against capitalism because they are broke.”
braah im so poor + living in ass and for the last two years i've been dreaming about one day buy myself doc martens and then do a mullet. all my dreams got shit on
I love how brain dead this is almost no one can be offended and everyone can be entertained. Great work homie
Dude you should come to America and do these videos would be hilarious.
I discovered cultural observations yesterday and was like "he should do one on mullets" and here we go
Do Air Jordans or Air Max 95!
Could you do one on the rise of tacky monogram clothing? Seems to be everywhere these days.
Ye forgot the bowlcullet
Patagonia cultural observation anyone? 🙏🏻
😂😂🫡
I had a mullet all throughout high school but when my brain fully developed I no longer had one. I’m Australian btw. You’ll find every second guy in public having a mullet
Do one on Carhartt jackets
I want a mullet now
every vid is better than previous. keep it up bruh
Against capitalism “because their broke” 😂
Eyez run when eyez see a wyte boi wit mullets
I love this guy and his broken English ❤️
'Cultural Observations: Pret Subscriptions' please
These boys will look back in 10years thinking why the fk did I spend the best part of my life and whilst I had hair  looking like weird Al Yankovic
There's a whole book on mullets from my hometown The Hague. Mullets (or in Dutch 'matjes') have always been part of The Hague subculture. Check out the book called Matlas (mullet atlas).
I'm triggered
The awkwardness on their faces as they assume they're going to be interviewed but instead just get the piss taken out of them underhandedly is brilliant
If Andrew Callaghan was Irish.
I live for the shuffle/run at the end of these videos
Honestly, having hair like this 15 years ago in a school environment would have destroyed you socially 👀
Do one on weirdos or alts
Colorful mullets are the iguana of the mullet world 🤣🤣
Behind every man with a mullet and a moustache is an indie girl who made him grow it
i luv frankie
Iphone and Android users would be gd topic
how fooking dare you 👨🏼
When you're featherin it brother
Absolutely breathtaking 😂 to see some docile frontal lobe mullet brains in the wild
Piek journalistiek
I love that mullets are coming back baby!
The best thing since Blindboy Boatclub.
My favorite:  The colorful & whopper mullet.
why are your videos so good
Yr man with the straight sports mullet has the same hair as my 1 year old son who has never had a haircut
As a girl who was just in aus, mullets can be so hot if done right
You are comedy Gold fam
Absolutely hilarious!
Thank you!
Irish mullets are weird as hell. Like a Fischer Price My first mullet
Please Ireland do not go down the mullet... I live in Oz
Lad sounds like he’s about to make me kill Andrew Ryan
Damn the mulleteer at 0:52 looks like my brother if we were born in a trailer park, and the one at 0:24 looks like me if I dreamed of being the hotdog eating champion of that same trailer park.
Frankie's exasperated "WhAT?" always gets to me
no one’s safe from frankie
Colorful mullet is dead accurate, always tread carefully around the evil fellas
Here before you blow up 💀
You need to go to Marbella and do one on the love island wannabes
i really truly hope one day you can do a cultural observations tour around the US
The best one I have seen yet - utterly brilliant format & execution by all involved
Why’s mullets back in the UK? I thought I was imagining it, but I see it all the time.
This guy is quickly becoming a legend, just wish he did some more raw stuff without strangers just standing there for the camera all the time. Ask em some off the bat questions
Thinking bout getting a mullet and this video comes out lololol
We truly live in a post-"lost in the supermarket" world. Thank you Frankie
it's almost like it's 1987 again
Do vintage guys
We need stoneisland
This guy is going to blow up
Mullet and mustache combo gives +1 bonus to bar fighting skill.  Like Begbie.
This is 100% awesome
Shit, mullets just hit Ireland huh? You guys must've just started watching baseball over there
They’re the perfect representation of yin and yang, the balance of life - up top for business, down back for party.
love it
Please do a series on shoes and the people who wear them eg: Converse, Doc Martens, Jordan’s, Superstar, AirForce 1 etc
“They never wear a tee shirt when they get drunk.” I have a mullet and everything I think this qualifies as hatespeech
Prawn cocktail smeg
Let's goooooo
People with mullets are side characters in their own lives
I am amazed at the unlimited supply of people he has to roast.
This reminds me of early Youtube - love it
Wait was that a Tim Hortons cup at :38 sec?? Y’all got tummies in Ireland??
Need a video on septum piercings
The people starring in those videos deserve credit though seriously
Sooner or later you will be car bombed for critiquing the wrong demographic, and I will remember your legendary heroism
love the fucking content bro
Holy fuck this one was savagely hilarious.
Dude i fucking love you
These are some of the worst looking mullets I’ve ever seen !!!
God, I love it when he runs in fear.
i keep getting recommended these videos and i kind of see the appeal but at the same time maybe someone needs to do a cultural observation on your judgemental adult virgin lookin ass no offense but what's up with dudes in our culture who look like you acting like this
Do one social experiment on curly hair sir, mullets are kind of extinct nowadays.
I'm amazed you were able to find so many, or perhaps there was a quick bit of barbering...
subtitles: variations in the mulachino, sports mole, bully in their skill, dos oil, tender mullet, sports model, sky park, color for mullets, spoiledful, holy opinionated beliefs, terrible mullet, industrial library, soft soil
"People with mullets identify as Australian, even if they've never been down to the Southern Hemisphere".    Accurate.
Keep this series going, best videos on YouTube at the moment
Proud of me mullet 😤😤
These videos are like the "edging" version of street fighting videos. He's always, like, 3 seconds away from getting the shit beaten out of him.
Hi Frankie 👋
Mullets to laddy lads, are like what pink hair is to a non binary vegans. A self satisfactory smug smirk to your virtue signalling grimace of outrage. Not judging, as I have a pathetic moustache just to have something to talk about.
If I could contribute my own observation, the mullet is often accompanied by the downy tash or "bean tickler" as it is known in some circles.
"The colorful mullet is against capitalism,because they're broke"   U absolute mad lad
My guy, that's some Levi-Strauss level of reaserch. Thank you for this!
This lad's amazing
Como un ferviente portador de Mullet post pandemia en el hemisferio sur, puedo confirmar que la información proporcionada en este reportaje es completamente c i e r t a. El Mullet no es solo un corte de cabello, es una identidad socio-cultural (that also attracts chicks on tinder)
Frankie you’re killing it with these videos keep up the hard work!
80s are back baby
as a 4:3 aspect ratio enjoyer I enjoy the fact that this is in 4:3
they hate capitalism because they're broke...man just destroyed the global south
U gonna be at 500k by May
We need the Stone Island observation 👀
wonder whether I should look up what mullet means. perhaps worth adding to the to do list
I love these videos. They are great!
As an English, am i allowed?
I feel personally attacked yet I have nothing to dispute.
As a doc Martens wearing guy with a mullet, who owns a North Face jacket, I don't even know what to make of myself anymore...
They probably don't even know what a bogan is
Observation into stone island
man I love your content.
How did you double in subs in two days Doc marten's video you had 24K now you have 50K Keep it going man! Been my favorite channel recently!
do girls with golden goose shoes
This guy never misses I wish he could come to California and do an episode on “edgars”
Jesus u actually picked some of the worst examples of mullet Ive seen in my life.
What about the female mullet?
I live in Kentucky though so my mullet is red blooded southern American
you're the goat
The content we did not asked for, but the content we deserve
I’m falling in love with your videos
Receiving strong NPS vibes
Hey, I'm against capitalism and I'm broke!  Guess I'll have to grow a mullet and see if my GF has any thoughts on how to dye it...  Oh yeah, new GF.  :-)  Hopefully a new cult member too.  We'll see.  Namaste.  🙏
2:09 wasn’t he the guy who didn’t have skinfade in “cultural observation: skinfade and northface jacket combo” video
mullets are sick
Do converse next
The mullet is only cool when it's uncool.
It’s like those being interviewed are watching the ending of a film they hate. They know it’s fate, but they have to watch it’s demise regardless.
Aw man this was a bit mean eh
Worst hairstyle I ever see, they just look bad
i have a sport mullet and can confirm
Mullet and a ronny havnt seen a ronny in about 3 year
buzzcuts next plz
Newcastle peeps sometimes call this the Jesmond mullet
The closeup on the north face logo 💀
I would like to hear your stance on mullets the USA and Australia, although looking quite identical, experts have claimed the behavior of the American species is slightly more aggressive and prone to right wing ideologies.   We await your expertise on said matter.
Why no femullets?
This guys a bloody hero
Awesome
First
Hope you’re enjoying all this FREE content you slobs. If you’d like to actually spend money on me you can buy my book. It’s a Toxic Travel Guide: Ireland as You’ve Never Seen it Before.   Link in description.   I’ve also got a patreon page if you’d like to sub on there. It’s meditations for the anxious mind. Namaste 🙏🏻
Mullets are for the Biggest of Bois. Appreciate ya x
Frankie is a pioneer in Critical Mullet Theory
Wow! I hadn’t realised how prevalent mullets were. Glad to see him shedding light on this epidemic
I wonder if you are australian or irish.
What accent do they have, Northern Ireland? Or maybe just Ireland
The Colourful mullet against capitalism because they’re broke 😂😂😂
I love how each of these observations gets increasingly more slanderous.
One of the crucial things that makes these videos great is... quality of the video itself. Don't change your camera for some fancy-shmancy 4k. Little bit of grain gives it that nice flavor of old youtube when "the grass was greener".
Go ballyfermot, Frankie. Check out the rainbow hair, face pierced art students. Wolves in self-diagnosed mental disorder sheep clothing.
More observations please.
0:36 Already cracking up lol
Mullet is a hairdo for a man of conviction. One who cares not for society's approval, just for making that society better. Also, it's a  good indicator of barbecue mastery.
I want a mullet but figured time I grow it won’t be cool
i love how they all indeed don't say anything when the mic is pointed at them.
Lol at the self affirming head-nod at 2:51 when you said about them being against capitalism.
T’es un génie mec
These analysis are getting better and better. This is true journalism
MASSIVELY UNDERATED
Incredible journalism
This man is going places. Just keep churning these out and you'll be at 100k in like a month.
Please make a video on subaru wrx owners lol
Lol
Damn I need a tender mullet
Bringing the mullet back is maybe the worst thing Gen Z have done.
They are a bane on society.
How many people with mullets are their still leaft in Irland, in the year of our Lord 2022? Gross! A Shame! I can't drink as much as I want to puke!
Recently discovered the channel, you are killing it!
i just got a mullet hahah
Ireland must be some kind of place
Coming next  Vauxhall Corsa drivers
This information was urgently needed
Mullets look great
Yes! Do what @rockit said. Do a cultural observation on piercings.
cool
"They think having a mullet is a successful contribution," "We can see mullets as a commodity in the shopping centers of social identity." Frankie, bruv, how do you come up with this stuff? Just beautiful.
I thought the USI had taken out a barring order against you on all campuses as you are a bad influence......
When he zoomed on the north face jacket 💀
Cultural observations >>>>>>>>>
Subscribed this morning and there’s a video by the afternoon. Instant reward
That last fella looks dangerous
Todays louis theroux with nothing to lose. Thank you for your journalistic service.  On another note, I'd love to see the Documentation of american mullets? The irish mullets are interesting, the smell of potato and ripe whiskey, but what about the american counterpart?
Please do one about those dumb (bull) nose rings..
damn it frankie, i was about to go to sleep
You really have a way with them mullet people ☺️
the straight haired mullet guy bruh wtf is that hairstyle💀💀💀
Pull a mullet if you want to catch a bullet, they say.
thank you very much for this sir, a classmate of mine has a mullet, what would be your advice?
Business in the front, party in the back.
“How fucking dare you” got me, as an Australian I applaud this video
YESSSSSSSSSSS MOOOORE OBSERVATIONS 😄😄😄😄
Doing a critical analysis of mullets in America or Australia would be its own episode
lmao
Intriguing observation
Also I love this series
First Greek comment
This is a video 🔥
I have to much hair

Mullets
