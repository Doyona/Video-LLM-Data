Missing this already 🎃
I'm not seeing the ten year challenge
OMG thank you so much as a returning player who was stuck at TH8 I'm so grateful This was so helpful cuz you need strategy I was all ongga bongga on the previous ones and got stuck on 2014 thanks again
why are you going so fast ii can’t keep up
can't do it.
Bro troops work nothing like you placed them down
Didn’t help me i tried at least 10 times now and it sucks man
Just one video so fucking useless
Thank you very much, I did it
Like dropped 👍
I got 99% ran out of time because of the hidden Tesla
I did it
Thank you so much 🙌🏽🙌🏽 didn't know passing this damn thing could feel so satisfying🐐
Shit man
Thanks 🥂
Bro missing 1 wizard sells the whole attack
I went straight to bash for this i suck at lalo and he’s amazing at it
Idk what I need to do but my troops do NOT do what yours do. I legit place my troops EXACTLY in the same spot that you do and as quickly as you do. But my king NEVER goes and destroys the archer tower and air defense. He ALWAYS dies too fast due to the clan troops…. I have tried 12+ times. It makes no fucking sense
Man, i tried everything you showed me about  how to beat this challenge, but the timer always runs out whenever there is a few buildings left, last attempt was a close one, i got 99% but the timer runned out with a only a F*CKING Elixir storage left while my remaining troops are already attacking it, i have the worst bad luck in these events but at least i beat the 2012 one.
Thank you
Love you bro
Super Legit!Now its easier to smash and i have tons of troops remains(alive) Lol.
Mantap bang  gara gara luh gua ngak stress lgi wkwkkw
♥️♥️♥️
Huge help, thanks!
i dont understand im doing the exact same thing yet my king always dies before he goes to attack the air defence
Huh
this is hard i can't do it
This IS NOT the 2014 clash thing for the game rn

tysm bro im subbing
Supercell is just stupid with these challenges, it's almost impossible to do it with the army they give you
You dont know how much ive been struggling with this, thaaaaank you sooo much bro. Subscribe your channel, bring more content pls
This man is goated I swear I come back to his videos everytime I need help
after 100 time failed, this one is like oasis in desert :D thanks!!! man
Why do pumpkins sit on people’s porches?       They have no hands to knock on the door.
Thank you
This one hurt. Thanks.
Praying that everyone falls asleep quickly and has a peaceful sleep. Hope you all wake up happy and well rested
Had to do the one Sturge did.  Couldn't get yours done.

Thank you thank you very very much bash
Didn’t work out for me sadly, the archer queen stayed back and got killed outside the wall without dealing much damage

This guide was so much better than sloths, thanks, took me around 30 tries. Not really enjoying these challenges as they heavily depend on good ai
Thank you so much man! I kept getting a 2 star no matter how many times I tried, I appreciate your walk throw
Thanks for the tip .Couldn't have done it without ya
I’m really loving this season so far with the pixel king being my first ski  and get it for free was nice and the free scenery we get in like 2 days is nice and thanks for the tips bash
This strat is ok but it doesn't get over 60% for me. Not sure what I'm doing wrong or if my placements aren't fast enough but it just gets destroyed by the xbows
Not sure if anyone else said this yet but. If you instead use all your loons and lava hounds on the cannons at the bottom (the same time you started using the lava and loons) and use rage you can clear out the base more consistently and evenly leaving about 1:20 left on the timer
haven’t done this type of attack in years i was struggling thanks for the help 😂
Took me a few attempts to get the system down, 1st time getting the system right I ran out of time 😂😂 got 98%. 2nd time time 100% cheers.
How do I still keep losing
Bought gold pass using code 'bash' Keep on clash bashing 🔥
god i love you, iv been playing since day 1 and struggled with this 1.. your the GOAT
I love you bash
Yay! Been trying to gain 100% but no success, thank you for this strategy 🇵🇭!!
wait to show you destroy 2015 & thanks for attack 2014
No matter which creator's video you see... they all have to take out wizard compartments with heroes, wizard tower (which is a weak defense against most armies) is that much painful for lava loons...
This video really helps, I hope you make more on the future challenges!
i can't even do it with the video, I'm doing exactly the same but still it isn't work it, it's so frustrating 🤦🏼‍♀️ but you're guide is still very good😂
Thanks dude ❤️
I trying 15 to get 3 stars thanks for this tips video bro 😍❤️
Ok. I’ve never been a LavaLoon guy. Tried two other methods, and they didn’t work at all. This, although a bit more complex, worked first time. Thanks man!!!
Thx
Dude it was an amazing strategy... I destroyed the 2014 challenge in one try with this super cool strategy of yours... Your the man boss 👐👏
Thanks for the good videos! I would like to see a th14 let’s play! Lab guide and so on. Love ur vids man!
your a life saviour sir💪🫡
YES spent whole day trying and about 1 hour trying your strategy and finally 100% thankyou!
Why do I feel like trying other people's strats is harder than making my own strat.
This base can be easily 3 star at ground troops but lavaloon I don't like.
I will do anything to get that skin at 15 stars
This guy is lying I put all of my troops down during the corect times it didn't work
Thank you
thanks for the guide, i was just getting 2 stars glad i found it
Thanks
I followed your advice and it worked but I legit had one second left before i won with 2 stars and 99%😂😂
This challenge took me 30-40 min to do the troops never did what i wanted 😭
It's not possible
Thanks bro i got 3 stars 🤩
THANKS!!! I LOST MY PATIENCE FIRST BEFORE LOOKING UP FOR TUTORIAL. 😂
In the last moment,  2015 challenge  unlocked. But how?
thx at least i could do it. but I put in the clan castle instead of the fitst hound it takes out the whole oponent cc. so the queen lives a bit longer.
easiest challenge I've ever done, triple on 1st attempt
Thank you we all appeciate haha
OMG!!!!!!!! 30 mins later I was able to get the 3 stars. Bless your soul ahaha
Thank you so much for the tthree star your the best
Thank you Bro!
Liked and subbed thanks for this was stuck on it. Gonna try do tomorrow by myself if not ill be back tomorrow 🤣
Appreciate you bro took me like 10 tries to perfectly place everything but I finally got it thank you for the tutorial!
Thank you.
Nice Bash, awesome sweater.
Wow thank you very much
I had to youtube this because I kept getting 85% two stars and it was pissing me off.
cool
When the new challenge came out the first thing i did was checking if there was a troll tesla
hey you champ !!! its got cleared. i throught i have to stop playing that portion but you made it possible.
This really doesn’t work for me
It took me like 5 tries but i did it
Really helpful 😃 thanks Mr. Bash 🔥
Thank you sooooooo much for this, I was stuck on that level for half an hour!
YOOO THANKS MAN I'LL BE BACK FOR TOMORROW. GIT YOURSELF A NEW SUBB
trash
I just tried 10 time, and still got 65%😭
🙏🏽👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Thank u!
Dude thank you , i was struggling with this level lol
I feel so glad that i did it on my own 😍😍 Thanks for this guide too ☂️
Simply wasted 1 hour on this attack ...it would have been better If I saw your video first...by the way thanks and keep updating 😁
That was so incredibly easy lol 😂 I tried 10 or so times on my own one time with your technique… I’m just a spammer
THANK YOU for this guide. Without it, I can barely get one star. Just returning to this great game, I remembered why I left, I absolutely suck at technical attacking‼️
super bro I win this because I was watched your vedio 💪
Wow your strategy is good
The queen can reach the enemy queen from the xbow+archer tower compartment.
Tried 15 times this is so shit
Where are anniversary’s statues friends we have not get them yet? Can anyone tell me?
Helpful video man but I'm not being a ass kisser like these other people commenting 😅
Bro thank you so much i will definitely be coming back here soon 😁
hi
Thanks!
😊
Yo that hoodie is SICK
Thank you for the guide! I had passed the level after a few tries!
I followed this strategy for almost 5-6 times and finally i got 3 stars even after wasting 1 rage spell by mistake at last. Lol 🤣
How can you already play the 2015 challenge?
Didn’t work for me at all
